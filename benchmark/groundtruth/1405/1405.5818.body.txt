Introduction

Fix an odd prime [formula] and let G be the poset of isomorphism classes of finite abelian [formula]-groups, with the relation [formula] if and only if there exists an injective group homomorphism [formula]. (For notational simplicity, from this point forward we will conflate finite abelian [formula]-groups and the equivalence classes containing them.) In 1984, Cohen and Lenstra [\cite=CL] proved that the function

[formula]

is a discrete probability distribution on G. (This fact had already been proved by Hall in [\cite=Hall], who used a different method). They then conjectured that if A∈G, then ν(A) is the probability that the [formula]-Sylow subgroup of the ideal class group of an imaginary quadratic number field is isomorphic to A. Since then, mathematicians have defined various probability distributions on G and conjectured that these distributions describe various phenomena, both number-theoretic (e.g., [\cite=FW], [\cite=CM], [\cite=EVW], [\cite=Mal], [\cite=G]) and combinatorial (e.g., [\cite=MMW], [\cite=CKLPM]).

Given any discrete probability distribution [formula] and any A∈G, define the Ath moment of ξ to be

[formula]

where for any B,A∈G, we define [formula] to be the set of surjective group homomorphisms from B to A. This terminology, which is becoming standard in the literature related to the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics (see, for example, [\cite=EVW] and [\cite=MMW]), is meant to evoke an analogy with the kth moment of a real-valued random variable X: just as the kth moment of X is the expected value of Xk, the Ath moment of ξ is the expected value of [formula], where B is a G-valued random variable. Moreover, under certain favorable conditions, the set of Ath moments of a distribution on G determines the distribution, making the analogy even stronger.

A precise description of these "favorable conditions", however, is still elusive. In [\cite=EVW], [\cite=MMW], and [\cite=G], for example, the moments of the particular discrete probability distributions on G in question completely determine the distribution. In [\cite=G], a Möbius inversion-type procedure transforms closed formulas for moments of certain distributions on G into closed formulas for the distribution itself. Some natural questions are:

what is this Möbius-type function?,

in what ways does it behave like the classical Möbius function?, and

in what conditions can it transform formulas for moments into formulas for distributions?

In this paper, we focus on the first two questions, leaving the third for later work. In , we begin by addressing the first question. That is, we define this new Möbius-type function associated to the poset G, which we denote [formula]. We also compare it to the case of the poset of subgroups of a group G, which we denote PG, and its associated Möbius function, which we denote [formula]. In particular, we state a result relating these two functions; see . We then state the main results of the paper, Theorems [\ref=temp] and [\ref=subg3], which we prove in . As an example application of Theorems [\ref=temp] and [\ref=subg3], we remark that they immediately imply: We would like to note the analogy between and Hall's result from 1934 [\cite=Hall2]: if G is an [formula]-group of order [formula], then μG(1,G) = 0 unless G is elementary abelian, in which case [formula]. In addition to implying , Theorems [\ref=temp] and [\ref=subg3] are both integral to the inversion procedure deployed in [\cite=G], and will be a useful tool in answering the third question mentioned above. In [\cite=Gab], we explore further properties of S, using it to expand on Cohen-Lenstra's identities on finite abelian [formula]-groups [\cite=CL]. Moreover, has applications to recent work in group theory: see Lucchini's  [\cite=Luc], below, and the discussion following it.

Definitions and results

Let P be a locally finite poset. The Möbius function on P, denoted by μP, is defined by the following criteria: for any x,z∈P,

[formula]

A classic reference for Möbius functions is [\cite=Rota]. Now, for any finite group G, let PG be the poset of subgroups of G ordered by inclusion. (To ease notation, let μG be the Möbius function on this poset.) For a history of the work on the Möbius function on this particular poset, see [\cite=HIO]. Recall that G is the poset of isomorphism classes of finite abelian [formula]-groups.

There has been recent progress towards describing groups with non-zero Möbius functions. For example, in 2007 Lucchini [\cite=Luc] proved the following:

In the light of , implies that there exists an infinite family of pairs of finite abelian [formula]-groups with trivial Möbius function:

In , below, we prove the main results of this paper, mentioned in . (See for the definition of rank.)

Proofs of main results

The combinatorics of the proofs that follow will rely on Lemmas [\ref=subg] to [\ref=subg2.5], which follow immediately from below. There are many descriptions of the quantity described in ; one such can be found in Theorem 8 in a recent paper of Delaunay and Jouhet [\cite=DJ]. The formula we present below is different than theirs; hopefully the ease with which it implies Lemmas [\ref=subg] to [\ref=subg2.5] makes up for its unwieldiness. Before we begin, we introduce some notation.

Before stating some consequences of , we need a bit more notation.

As an example, consider the group [formula]. Then [formula], [formula], and [formula]. We will use the following three lemmas in the proofs of our main results.

Computation following from .

We now have the tools to prove Theorems [\ref=temp] and [\ref=subg3]. For any A,C∈G, concerns the case where [formula], and concerns the case where [formula].

By , we know S(A,C) is a sum of products of subgroup data--one summand for every A-chain with maximum C. Choose some such chain, say [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. Consider the set

[formula]

If [formula] is empty, then the theorem is trivially true since there is some [formula] such that [formula]. Thus, suppose it is not empty and let [formula].

There are two possibilities for the ranks of [formula] and [formula]: either [formula] or [formula]. It turns out that summands in the former case cancel out those in the latter. Indeed, if [formula], then we know by that

[formula]

Thus, [formula] cancels with another summand in S(A,B), one associated to a chain that is longer than [formula] by one subgroup; namely, the chain

[formula]

In contrast to [formula], the first subgroup in [formula] that is not of the form [formula] for any [formula] has the same rank as its predecessor (ie, [formula]).

Now suppose that [formula] and [formula] had satisfied the other possibility; ie, that [formula]. If [formula], then the summand cancels with a summand whose chain is one shorter. Specifically, we know by that it cancels with the summand associated to the chain [formula]. Thus, the only summands of S(A,B) that that remain are those associated to chains with minimum element the same rank as A. Using this fact, we can write

[formula]

Note that if [formula], then the above sum vanishes and we are done. Thus, suppose it is not empty and let

[formula]

We can repeat the argument above to see that

[formula]

If there is some [formula] such that [formula], then we are done. If not, then the argument from the previous paragraphs and the definition of B imply that S(B,C) = 0, completing the proof.

In the light of , we now address S(A,C) in the case where [formula].

Suppose that A < C (otherwise the result is trivial). We will induct on r. To begin, suppose that r = 1, and define [formula] by [formula] and [formula]. Since A and C are cyclic, we see that for any [formula],

[formula]

Moreover, the fact that A and C are cyclic also implies that [formula] for any A-chain in the above set. By assumption, we know that c - a - 1 > 0, so [formula]. This completes the base case.

We split the general case into three cases. For the first case, suppose that exp A  =   exp C. For any B∈G, let [formula] denote B / 〈b〉, where b∈B is any element of order exp B. Similarly, if [formula] is a B-chain, we define [formula] to be [formula]. Now, since exp A  =   exp C, we see that [formula] is in bijection with [formula] under the map [formula]. Moreover, given any A-chain [formula] with [formula], implies that [formula], where K is a constant depending only on A and C. The result now follows by induction.

For the second case, suppose that [formula]. For any A-chain C with [formula], let [formula] denote [formula]. For any B∈G such that A < B  ≤  C and exp B  >   exp A, let [formula]. For any such B with BC  ≠  A, we can partition the set [formula] into two subsets: those chains that contain BC and those that do not. We remark that these two subsets are in bijection under the following map: if an A-chain does not contain BC, then add it. The inverse to this map is simply the deletion of BC from any A-chain. Now, by Lemmas [\ref=subg2] and [\ref=subg2.5], we know that B has exactly one subgroup isomorphic to BC. Thus, for any A0 such that A  ≤  A0 < BC, we know that

[formula]

But this means that any summand associated to a chain in the first subset cancels with the summand associated to the image of the chain under the above bijection. Thus,

[formula]

Now, for any B∈G with A < B  ≤  C, exp B  >   exp A, and BC = A, note that

[formula]

But S(B,C) = 0 for all such B, by the argument of the previous paragraph. Thus,

[formula]

completing this case.

Finally, consider the case where [formula]. As in the previous case, we have that

[formula]

The difference in this case is that if [formula] is an A-chain with [formula], then it is impossible that [formula], so the proof is complete.

Theorems [\ref=temp] and [\ref=subg3] immediately imply the following corollary.

Finally, and imply the following result.
