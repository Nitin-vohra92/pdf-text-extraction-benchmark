Introduction

Displaced-beam scintillometers are useful to make measurements of turbulent heat fluxes since their footprint is much larger than other measurement devices such as sonic anemometers. Their source measurements are the index of refraction structure parameter C2n and the turbulence inner scale length lo, which are used to infer the turbulent heat fluxes [\cite=HILL1988L0] [\cite=ANDREAS1992]. This inference follows from equations from the Monin-Obukhov similarity hypothesis, which is a model for turbulent fluxes of heat and momentum in the atmospheric surface layer [\cite=SORBJAN]. Studying the sensitivity of the derived turbulent heat flux to the uncertainties in the source measurements is important, and several studies have been published exploring the case of measurements over flat terrain [\cite=ANDREAS1989] [\cite=MORONI] [\cite=ANDREAS1992] [\cite=SOLIGNAC]. There is debate over whether the Monin-Obukhov similarity hypothesis can be applied over variable terrain since the canonical model is for flat terrain, however many scintillometer field campaigns take place over variable terrain [\cite=HARTOGENSIS] [\cite=MEIJNINGERPWF2002]. The turbulent fluxes are derived through equations which extend the Monin-Obukhov equations from flat terrain to variable terrain via the application of an effective beam height [\cite=HARTOGENSIS2003] [\cite=KLEISSL2008] [\cite=EVANS2011] [\cite=GELI2012]. The effective beam height is calculated assuming that the Monin-Obukhov surface layer profiles in height are valid over the slowly varying terrain. The research question to be asked is, if one can safely extend the Monin-Obukhov equations from flat terrain to variable terrain, then in what manner is the error propagated from the uncertainty in topography to the derived turbulent heat flux?

Through the assumptions of the Monin-Obukhov similarity hypothesis, the sensible heat flux in the atmospheric surface layer is given by

[formula]

where HS is the sensible heat flux, ρ is the density of air, cp is the heat capacity, [formula] is the friction velocity, and [formula] is the temperature scale. Resolving [formula] and [formula] from C2n and lo starts at another similarity equation relating [formula] to [formula] and [formula]:

[formula]

where zeff is the effective beam height of the scintillometer beam, L is the Obukhov length, κ is the Von Kármán constant, G is the acceleration due to gravity, and T is the temperature [\cite=HARTOGENSIS2003]. In equation [\ref=zetauniversal] we omit the term due to humidity seen in for simplicity as it has no effect on the results here.

When ζ > 0 we are in a stable atmospheric surface layer. In the stable case we have

[formula]

where a, c and h are empirical constants [\cite=WYNGARD1971] [\cite=WYNGARD1971phi], z(u) is the height profile of the beam above the ground where u is the normalized distance along the beam, G(u) is the path weighting function , C2T is the temperature structure parameter which is inferred from C2n, and zeff is the effective beam height assuming that the C2T profile satisfies equation [\ref=CT2stable] for any z along z(u) [\cite=ANDREAS1992] [\cite=HARTOGENSIS2003]. The turbulent dissipation rate ε is directly related to lo by

[formula]

where Γ is the Gamma function, K is the Obukhov-Corrsin constant and D(ρ,T) is the thermal diffusivity of air [\cite=ANDREAS1992].

When ζ < 0 we are in an unstable atmospheric surface layer. In the unstable case we have

[formula]

where b and d are empirical constants, and zeff is the effective beam height assuming that the C2T profile satisfies equation [\ref=CT2unstable] for any z along z(u) [\cite=HARTOGENSIS2003].

Error is propagated from the source measurements to the derived variable HS via the error propagation equation

[formula]

where the general derived variable f is a function of general source measurement variables x1,x2,...,xN with respective systematic error σxs1,σxs2,...,σxsN and with respective independent Gaussian distributed uncertainties with standard deviations σxr1,σxr2,...,σxrN as seen in . Computational error is given by σfc. The first and last terms represent an offset from the true solution, whereas the central term is a measure of the width of the error bars.

Error propagation can be studied with Monte-Carlo methods as in , however this is best reserved for cases where a closed-form error propagation equation cannot be derived. We will seek a closed-form equation. As a start, it is practical for the purpose of a sensitivity study to rewrite Eq. [\ref=errorprop] as

[formula]

where Sf,x are unitless sensitivity functions defined by

[formula]

The sensitivity functions are each a measure of the portion of the error in the derived variable f resulting from error on each individual source measurement x [\cite=ANDREAS1992]. Our goal is to evaluate SHS,z(u), where the height profile z(u) is distributed, hence functional derivatives will be used as in . We have

[formula]

The sensitivity function SHS,z for this measurement strategy over flat terrain has been evaluated in .

We will solve for the sensitivity function in equation [\ref=SHszu] for stable conditions in section 2. In section 3 we will solve for the sensitivity function in equation [\ref=SHszu] for unstable conditions. In section 4 we will apply the sensitivity function to the topography of a real field site. We conclude in section 5.

Stable case (ζ > 0)

Here we can combine equations [\ref=zetauniversal], [\ref=CT2stable] and [\ref=ustarstable] to arrive at

[formula]

where

[formula]

Unstable case (ζ < 0)

Here we combine equations [\ref=zetauniversal], [\ref=CT2unstable] and [\ref=ustarunstable]; we achieve

[formula]

where

[formula]

In the unstable case, zeff is coupled to ζ through equation [\ref=zeffunstable]. We input equation [\ref=zetaunstable] into equation [\ref=zeffunstable] to arrive at

[formula]

This is a single equation in the single unknown ζ, where all other variables are measured. This equation is in fixed point form and can be solved numerically via fixed point recursion as seen in and in . The variable interdependency is mapped out in the tree diagram seen in figure [\ref=TREE2].

Results

We have solved the sensitivity function SHS,z(u) which depends on z(u) and ζ for both stable conditions where ζ > 0 and for unstable conditions where ζ < 0. In order to visualize the sensitivity function, we will demonstrate it with a field site beam path height profile z(u). We use the Imnavait basin field site seen in figure [\ref=IMNAVIATPATH].

This field site has a beam height z(u) as seen in figure [\ref=zG]. A random error component of 0.5m is used in figure [\ref=zG] since the difference between ground truth GPS measurements and the digital elevation map used has a standard deviation of approximately 0.5m as seen in figure [\ref=GPS]. Note that the magnitude of the error does not influence the results of this study.

For the Imnavait basin path z(u) seen in figure [\ref=zG], taking equation [\ref=SHzstable] for the stable case, and equations [\ref=SHzunstable] and [\ref=deltazetadeltazunstable2] for the unstable case, we arrive at the sensitivity function seen in figure [\ref=SHsz]. Note that values of [formula] for a given ζ in equation [\ref=deltazetadeltazunstable2] follow from the numerical solution to equation [\ref=zetaunstablefinal].

The sensitivity gets higher from stable conditions to unstable conditions, and it is focused in areas near the center of the beam path, as well as in areas of topographic protrusion. Note the clear spikes in sensitivity at u = 0.38 and at u = 0.5 in figure [\ref=SHsz]. These points in the path correspond to local minima in z(u) as seen in figure [\ref=zG]. This makes sense since C2T decreases nonlinearly in height above the ground, most rapidly near the surface. In areas where the beam approaches the ground, the gradient in C2T is higher as seen in equations [\ref=CT2stable] and [\ref=CT2unstable], therefore uncertainties in the actual height of the beam in those areas will translate into high uncertainties in the derived variables.

Note that if we consider a constant ratio of [formula], the term in, for example Eq. ([\ref=errorprop2]), can be re-written as

[formula]

where the term in square brackets is plotted in figure [\ref=SHszint].

This result is the average value of the sensitivity along the whole length of the path, and it converges to the same result for all paths. The sensitivity function in figure [\ref=SHszint] is compatible with the one-dimensional sensitivity function for flat terrain seen in .

Conclusion

Using the effective beam height extension of the Monin-Obukhov similarity equations to variable terrain, we have solved for how uncertainty in topographic heights propagates to displaced-beam scintillometer measurements of turbulent heat fluxes over any field site. We have found that uncertainty is concentrated in areas around topographic protuberances, as well as near the center of the beam path as seen in figures [\ref=zG] and [\ref=SHsz]. The local sensitivity can easily approach values of 200% in unstable conditions as seen in figure [\ref=SHsz], but the average sensitivity over the beam path never exceeds 100% as seen in figure [\ref=SHszint]. These results carry important ramifications in the selection of beam paths, in the calculation of uncertainty, and in the type of topographic data used. It may be that for many scintillometer beam paths, in order to achieve reasonable uncertainty we must use high precision LIDAR topographic data in order to reduce what is likely the greatest contributor to overall uncertainty.

It is interesting that the average value of the sensitivity function SHS,z(u) over the beam path reduces to the identical sensitivity function SHS,z for diplaced-beam scintillometers over flat terrain as seen in figure [\ref=SHszint] and in . We have essentially expanded the flat terrain sensitivity function first explored in from one dimension to two, and then we averaged through one dimension to arrive back at the original one-dimensional sensitivity function. Future work should perhaps focus on applying this type of sensitivity analysis on large aperture scintillometers using the Businger-Dyer relation to obtain path averaged [formula], [formula] and HS measurements. Additional work should be performed for scintillometer paths which are below the blending height over heterogeneous terrain [\cite=WIERINGA1986] [\cite=MASON1987] [\cite=CLAUSSEN1990] [\cite=CLAUSSEN1995] [\cite=MEIJNINGERPWF2002] [\cite=HARTOGENSIS2003] [\cite=LILU].
