Uncertainties analysis of fission fraction for reactor antineutrino experiments

Introduction

Reactor antineutrino experiment have always acted as an important role in the subject of neutrino physics and relative physics. For instant, the Savannah River Experiment[\cite=lab1] [\cite=lab1-1] by Reines and Cowan in 1956 first detected the neutrino. The KamLAND[\cite=lab3] experiment confirmed neutrino oscillation and explained the solar neutrino deficit together with the SNO experiment in the first few years after 2000. Just before that, the CHOOZ [\cite=lab2] experiment determined the most stringent upper limit of the last unknown neutrino mixing angle, sin 22θ13 < 0.17 at 90% confidence level. After this, a generation of reactor neutrino experiments[\cite=lab4] [\cite=reno] [\cite=chooze] made efforts to determine the value of θ13. In March of 2012, the Daya Bay collaboration[\cite=lab4] discovered a non-zero value for sin 22θ13 at a 5σ confidence level, which has fueled discussions about the direction of neutrino physics in the foreseeable future. At the same time, The Nucifer Experiment[\cite=nucifer] is a proposed test of equipment and methodologies for using neutrino detection (or, more specifically, antineutrino detection) for the monitoring of nuclear reactor activity and the assessment of the isotopic composition of reactor fuels for non-proliferation treaty compliance monitoring. In the future,JUNO[\cite=juno] will be determining neutrino mass hierarchy by precisely measuring the energy spectrum of reactor electron antineutrinos.

The prediction of antineutrino flux and its uncertainty is an indispensable part of reactor neutrino experiments, especially absolute measurement experiments which use a single detector. Usually, the following formula is used to calculate the antineutrino flux from one reactor core:

[formula]

Where Wth(MeV/s) is the thermal power of the core, Ei(MeV/fission)[\cite=maxb] is the energy released per fission for isotope i, fi is the fission rate of isotope i, and F is the sum of fi for all isotopes. Thus, fi / F is the fission fraction of each isotope. Si(Eν) is the antineutrino energy spectrum of isotope i, which is normalized to one fission. Normally, Wth and fi / F of each isotope are supplied by the nuclear power plants of the reactor neutrino experiments. fi / F of each isotope are calculated by using commercial reactor simulation code SCIENCE in Daya Bay antineutrino experiment. To evaluate the uncertainties of the fission fraction, DRAGON code was improved to have the ability output the fission fraction and Takahama-3 burnup benchmark was used to verify the correct of the development. Then, the improved DRAGON code is also used and the results calculated by DRAGON are compared with those of SCIENCE.

Improved DRAGON code

Oscillation experiments detect antineutrinos via the signal:

[formula]

which has a threshold at 1.8MeV. Reactors produce antineutrinos above this threshold through the decay chains of four primary fissile nuclide: 235U, 238U, 239Pu and 141Pu. However, DRAGON [\cite=dragon] is capable of simulating all the important actinides and some of the important fission products produced during the evolution of a reactor core. These include, but are not limited to, the long-lived isotopes: 238Pu, 240Pu, 242Pu, 237Np, 241Am, 242Cm et.al. DRAGON is a lattice code which means it can be used for cell or assembly transport calculation and depletion calculation, but it can't be used for core calculation. If one want to do the core calculation, DONJON[\cite=donjon] must be used and the cross section used in DONJON is generated by DRAGON. DRAGON is an open-source simulation package that allows one to study the behavior of neutrons in a nuclear reactor. It allows one to determine the isotopic concentrations of radionuclides during the burn-up cycle, as well as to perform isotopic depletions. But, DRAGON can not be used for reactor antineutrino experiment uncertainty analysis directly because it can't calculate fission fraction of 235U,238U,239Pu and 141Pu which are needed in the antineutrino reactor experiment. In order to evaluate the fission fraction for the antineutrino experiment, DRAGON was improved to calculate the fission rates of the four most important isotopes in fissions and two step calculation method was used to the depletion calculation. After that, the correlation coefficients between 235U, 238U, 239Pu and 241Pu was studied using DRAGON for the first time, and the results was used by the Daya Bay Collaboration the uncertainties analysis of the fission fraction.

The Takahama-3 burnup benchmark

In order to verify the accuracy of results calculated by DRAGON, the Takahama-3 burnup benchmark was calculated. The Takahama-3 reactor is a PWR as well as Daya Bay reactor, which operates with 157 fuel assemblies producing a total thermal power of 2652MW. The assembly is a 17×  17 design, meaning there are 289 locations for rods. A diagram of a Takahama-3 assembly is shown in Fig.[\ref=fig1]. The benchmark began with assemblies loaded with fresh UO2 fuel rods with an initial enrichment of 4.11% 235U by weight, with the remainder being 238U. Each assembly features 14 gadolinium-bearing(Gd2O3) fuel rods containing 2.63% 235U and 6% gadolinium by weight. Sixteen samples selected from three fuel rods irradiated in assemblies NT3G23 and NT3G24 of the Takahama-3 reactor were included for destructive isotopic analysis. The burnup of these samples was between 14 and 47 GWd/MTU. Isotopic dilution mass spectroscopy was used to determine uranium and plutonium inventories, different mass spectroscopy and alpha and gamma counting techniques were used to determine isotopic concentrations of the other elements. For the most relevant isotopes, namely 235U, 238U, 239Pu and 141Pu, the uncertainty associated with the determination of the isotopic mass fraction is <  0.1% for uranium isotopes and <  0.3% for plutonium isotopes[\cite=lab7].The three fuel rods came from two different assemblies. From the first assembly, labeled NT3G23, a normal uranium dioxide fuel rod (SF95) and a gadolinium-bearing fuel rod (SF96) were studied after two cycles. From the second assembly, labeled NT3G24, a normal uranium dioxide fuel rod (SF97) was studies after three cycles. We focus on SF97, because it had the longest irradiation time and therefore any cumulative systematic effects would be maximized. The rod was present in three consecutive fuel cycles of 385, 402, and 406 days with 88 days and 62 days of cool-down time between cycles as shown in Table 1. Samples were taken from SF97 at the six locations indicated in Table 1. Sample SF97-1 was located only 163 mm from the top of the rod, making the correct modeling of neutron leakage difficult. The construction of the SF97 rod simulation starts with a geometric description of the fuel assembly and the initial isotopic inventory of the fuel pellets. The primary inputs used in the simulation are found in Table1 and Table 2, and a mean boron concentration of 630 ppm per cycles[\cite=lab8] is used. The pellet stack density is 10.07 g/cm3. Those are the standard values used by the other simulations considered. Cross section libraries based on ENDF/B-VII.0 are used in the simulation.

When the DRAGON simulation is complete, the results for rod SF97 are extracted. Fig.[\ref=U235],[\ref=Pu239] and [\ref=Pu241] show the ratio of calculated to experimentally measured mass inventories for SF97 for three isotopes important to antineutrino experiments:235U, 239Pu and 241Pu. For the other isotopes, the DRAGON results are consistent with those calculated by other codes, such as SCALE4.4a[\cite=lab8], SCALE5[\cite=lab10], ORIGEN-S[\cite=lab11], MONTE-BURNS[\cite=lab12], and HELIOS[\cite=lab8]. However, there is a large deviation in SF97-1, located near the top edge of the fuel rod characterized by high leakage and large flux gradients. This effect is observed in results from all the codes which are all based on two dimensional calculation. If one want to take into account of the leakage, three dimensional calculation must be done. Neglecting SF97-1, we calculated the average deviation over the rod by taking the average of the samples. Even neglecting sample 1, the average deviation for 235U, 239Pu and 241Pu which are shown in Table [\ref=tab3] are 6.32%, 5.08% and 4.92% respectively. Neutrino experiments are interested in fission fraction rather than mass inventories. The instantaneous fission fraction predictions for SF97 through the three fuel cycles was shown in Fig.[\ref=fissionrate]. The trend is same as Ref[\cite=lab7]. This demonstrate that DRAGON can offer reliable fission fraction for PWRs simulation.

Antineutrino flux and uncertainties analysis

If we know the fission rates of each isotope from core simulation, and neutrino energy spectra of each isotope, we can easily get the neutrino flux S(Eν) = ΣifiSi(Eν), where fi is the fission rate of isotope i and S(Eν) is its neutrino spectrum. However, the fission rates are proportional to the thermal power of the core ,which is fluctuating. It is unrealistic to repeat core simulation to reflect the power fluctuation. Normally we scale the neutrino flux to the measured thermal power and Equation([\ref=eq1]) is used to calculate the antineutrino spectra emitted from reactor. If the antineutrino spectra which have been emitting from the reactor are known, the antineutrino spectra of the detector can be calculated using the following equation.

[formula]

Where the detector is located in p position, Sp(Eν) are the antineutrino spectra of the detector, L is the length of the baseline, σIBD(Eν) is the cross section of the inverse bate decay reaction, and Np is the number of proton in the detector. If the value of different parameter which was given in table [\ref=antineu] was supposed as the input parameter when we calculated the antineutrino spectra of the detector, and the fission fraction was obtained by using DRAGON, the antineutrino spectra of the detector was shown in Fig.[\ref=spectra].

In this article, We calculated the fission fraction using DRAGON and compared its value with those from SCIENCE program. If the fission fraction uncertainty was known, then the uncertainty of the antineutrino flux by the fission fraction was obtained using the error transfer formula.

[formula]

Where [formula] is the uncertainty of antineutrino flux by the fission fraction, δαi is the uncertainty of fission fraction of the isotopes i (i=235U,238U,239Pu and 241Pu), ρi,j are the correlation coefficients between 235U,238U,239Pu and 241Pu.

The reactor core of the Daya Bay nuclear power plant consists of 157 fuel assemblies, and each assembly contains 264 fuel cell of uranium dioxide. For the initial cores, there were three kinds of enrichment fuel in the core, such as 1.8%, 2.4%, and 3.1%, and the refueling cycle period was 12 moths. For now Daya Bay has increased their fuel enrichment to 4.45% in order to archive refueling cycle from 12 moths to 18 moths. By the end of the cycle, about 1/3 assemblies will be discharged from the core and the fuel in the outer region will be moved to the inner region to get a deeper buren-up. In this article, DRAGON was used to simulate the core depletion and relative fission fraction from DRAGON was compared with that from SCIENCE, which was used in the Daya Bay nuclear power plant. The results were shown in Fig.[\ref=fissionduibi]. For the four isotopes, the DRAGON results were consistent with SCIENCE calculation results. The average deviation for 235U,238U, 239Pu and 241Pu are 0.71%, 4.2%, 2.1% and 3.5% respectively. The average deviation for all isotopes are less than the deviation which was calculated using takahama benchmark, but the results which obtained from the experiment benchmark was usually regarded as more reliable than that obtained from the different program comparing. In addition, in reference [\cite=apollo], the interpretation performed with the APOLLO2.8 code package shows that the concentrations of the main fissile isotopes -   235U, 239Pu and 241Pu -   are predicted with an experimental uncertainty below 5% (1σ). Therefor, If we assume the uncertainty of the fission fraction is proportional to the uncertainty of the isotopes density, it is suitable that the uncertainty of the fission fraction could be estimated as 5%.

The correlation coefficients between 235U,238U,239Pu and 241Pu was important for determined the uncertainty of the antineutrinos flux by the fission fraction. The correlation coefficients were evaluated using assembly data from the Daya Bay reactor core. Table [\ref=tab1] show the correlation coefficient matrix between 235U,238U,239Pu and 241Pu. According to the difference of the calculation atomic density and measurement by different programs, correlation coefficients are also obtained from reference [\cite=zdj]. Because of using the Daya Bay reactor core data, the results of us is maybe more suit for Daya Bay antineutrino experiment.

According to the equation ([\ref=uncer]), If we take the uncertainties for all isotopes as 5%, the uncertainty of the antineutrino flux by the fission fraction simulation is 0.6% per core.

Conclusion

In order to predict the fission fraction of the reactor in the antineutrino experiment, DRAGON was improved and Takahama-3 burnup benchmark was used to verify the uncertainties by comparison calculation results with the experiment. Given the power history of assembles of the reactor core, the improved DRAGON code was used to simulate the Daya Bay reactor and the fission fraction calculated by DRAGON was consistent with that of SCIENCE results. The average deviation for 235U,238U, 239Pu and 241Pu are 0.71%, 4.2%, 2.1% and 3.5% respectively. Comparison of the 5% uncertainties for each isotopes used in Daya Bay antineutrino experiment, the 5% uncertainties are suitable and conservative. The uncertainty of the antineutrino flux by the fission fraction simulation is 0.6% per core for Daya Bay antineutrino experiment. Otherwise, we still don't know what reason account for the 5% fission fraction uncertainties. In generally, the reaction rate can be defined as where, Rif is the fission rate of isotopes i, Σif is the average macroscopic fission cross section, Ni is the atomic density of isotopes i, if is the average microscopic fission cross section, and [formula] is the average neutron flux. According to equation ([\ref=rate]), the fission fraction can be defined as If the uncertainties of Ni, if and [formula] are known, we may have more knowledge of source uncertainties of fission fraction. the uncertainties of Ni, if and [formula] can be done using the core simulation code. The uncertainties of each term should be studied in the future.
