Abstract

New double ratios of exponential moments of different two-point functions, which are less sensitive to the heavy quark mass and to the continuum effects than the commonly used ratio of moments, are presented for a more refined analysis of the mass-splittings between the different heavy quarkonia states. We show that at the c and b quark mass scales the 1 / m-expansion does not converge for these quarkonia channels, while a connection of our mass and width formulae, with the potential model ones is done. Using the present value of the QCD coupling αs, we deduce the value: 〈αsG2〉  =  (7.5  ±  2.5)  ×  10- 2 GeV4 of the gluon condensate from Mψ - Mηc and Mχb - MΥ, which we compare with the ones from different fits of the heavy and light quark channels. We also find that Mχc(P11) - Mχc(P31) is gouverned by the radiative corrections and gives αs(1.3 GeV)=0.64+ 0.36- 0.18 for 4 flavours, implying αs(MZ) = 0.127  ±  0.011. Our predictions for the splittings of different heavy quarkonia states are summarized in Table 2, where, in particular, we find MΥ - Mηb  ≈  63- 29+ 51 MeV implying the possible observation of the ηb in the Υ-radiative decay.

The double ratio of moments

QCD spectral sum rule (QSSR) à la SVZ [\cite=SVZ] (for a recent review, see e.g. [\cite=SNB]) has shown since 15 years, its impressive ability for describing the complex phenomena of hadronic physics with the few universal "fundamental" parameters of the QCD Lagrangian (QCD coupling αs, quark masses and vacuum condensates built from the quarks and/or gluon fields), without waiting for a complete understanding of the confinement problem. In the example of the two-point correlator:

[formula]

associated to the generic hadronic current: [formula] of the heavy Q-quark (Γ is a Dirac matrix which specifies the hadron quantum numbers), the SVZ-expansion reads:

[formula]

where μ is an arbitrary scale that separates the long- and short-distance dynamics; C(J) are the Wilson coefficients calculable in perturbative QCD by means of Feynman diagrams techniques; 〈O〉 are the non-perturbative condensates of dimension D built from the quarks or/and gluon fields (D = 0 corresponds to the case of the naï ve perturbative contribution). Owing to gauge invariance, the lowest dimension condensates that can be formed are the D = 4 light quark mq〈ψ〉 and gluon 〈αsG2〉 ones, where the former is fixed by the pion PCAC relation, whilst the latter is known to be (0.07  ±  0.01) GeV4 from more recent analysis of the light [\cite=SNL] quark systems [\cite=SNB]. The validity of the SVZ-expansion has been understood formally, using renormalon techniques (absorption of the IR renormalon ambiguity into the definitions of the condensates and absence of some extra 1 / q2-terms not included in the OPE) [\cite=MUELLER] [\cite=BENEKE] and/or by building renormalization-invariant combinations of the condensates (Appendix of [\cite=PICH] and references therein). The SVZ expansion is phenomenologically confirmed from the unexpected accurate determination of the QCD coupling αs and from a measurement of the condensates from semi-inclusive τ-decays [\cite=PICH]-[\cite=DUFLOT]. The previous QCD information is transmitted to the data through the spectral function ImΠQ(t) via the Källen-Lehmann dispersion relation (global ~ duality) obeyed by the hadronic correlators, which can be improved from the uses of different versions of the sum rules [\cite=SVZ], [\cite=RRY]-[\cite=BELL]. In this paper, we shall use the simple duality ansatz parametrization: ``one  ~  narrow  ~  resonance" + ``QCD  ~  continuum", from a threshold tc, which gives a good description of the spectral integral in the sum rule analysis, as has been tested successfully in the light-quark channel from the e+e-  →   I = 1 hadron data and in the heavy-quark ones from the e+e-  →  ψ or Υ data. We shall work with the relativistic version of the Laplace or exponential sum rules where the QCD expression konown to order αs is given in terms of the pole mass m(p2 = m2) [\cite=BELL],[\cite=BERT]-[\cite=PARK] :

[formula]

where:

[formula]

is a dimensionless variable, while [formula] (notation used in the literature) is the exponential Laplace sum rule variable; FH, ~ PH and QH are complete QCD Whittaker functions compiled in Ref. [\cite=BERT]-[\cite=PARK]; H specifies the hadronic channel studied. In principle, the pair (σ,tc) is free external parameters in the analysis, so that the optimal result should be insensitive to their variations. Stability criteria, which are equivalent to the variational method, state that the best results should be obtained at the minimas or at the inflexion points in n or σ, while stability in tc is useful to control the sensitivity of the result in the changes of tc-values. These stability criteria are satisfied in the heavy quark channels studied here, as the continuum effect is negligible and does not exceed 1% of the ground state contribution [\cite=SNB] [\cite=BERT], such that at the minimum in σ, one expects to a good approximation:

[formula]

Moreover, one can a ~ posteriori check that, at the stability point, where we have an equilibrium between the continuum and the non-perturbative contributions, which are both small, the OPE is still convergent such that the SVZ-expansion makes sense. The previous approximation can be improved by working with the double ratio of moments :

[formula]

provided that each ratio of moments stabilizes at about the same value of σ, as in this case, there is a cancellation of the different leading terms such as the heavy quark mass (and its ambiguous definition used in some previous literatures), the negligible continuum effect (which is already small in the ratio of moments), and each leading QCD corrections. We shall limit ourselves here to the αs-correction for the perturbative contribution and to the leading order one in αs for the gluon condensate effects. To the order we are working, the gluon condensate is well-defined as the ambiguity only comes from higher order terms in αs, which have, however, a smaller numerical effect than the one from the error of the phenomenological estimate of the condensate.

Test of the 1 / m-expansion

For this purpose, we use the complete horrible results expressed in terms of the pole mass to order αs given by [\cite=BERT] and checked by various authors [\cite=SNB], which we expand with the help of the Mathematica program. We obtain for different channels the expressions given in Table 1. By comparing the complete and truncated series in 1 / m, one can notice that, at the c and b mass scales, the convergence of the 1 / m-expansion is quite bad due to the increases of the numerical coefficients with the power of 1 / m and to the alternate signs of the 1 / m series.

Balmer-mass formula from the ratio of moments

The Balmer formula derived from a non-relativistic approach (m  →    ∞  ) of the Schrödinger levels reads [\cite=LEUT] (see also [\cite=DOSCH]-[\cite=YND]). for the S31 vector meson:

[formula]

It is instructive to compare this result with the mass formula obtained from the ratio of moments within the 1 / m-expansion. Using the different QCD corrections in Table 1, one obtains the mass formula at the minimum in σ of R:

[formula]

In the case of the b-quark, where we expect the static approximation more reliable,the minimum of this quantity is obtained to leading order at:

[formula]

where we have used for 5 flavours : αs(σ)≃0.32  ±  0.06 after evolving the value αs(MZ) = 0.118  ±  0.006 from LEP [\cite=BETHKE] and τ-decay data [\cite=PICH]-[\cite=DUFLOT]. The inclusion of the gluon condensate correction shifts the value of σmin to:

[formula]

These previous values of σ confirm the more involved numerical analysis in [\cite=BERT] and indicates the relevance of the gluon condensate in the analysis of the spectrum. By introducing the previous leading order expression of σcoul into the sum rule, one obtains:

[formula]

where one can deduce by identification in the static limit (mb  →    ∞  ) that the Coulombic effect is exactly the same in the two approaches. The apparent factor π / 3 is due to the fact that we use here the approximate Schwinger interpolating formula for the two-point correlator . The gluon condensate coefficient is also about the same in the two approaches. This agreement indicates the consistency of the potential model and sum rule approach in the static limit, though a new extra α2s correction due to the v2 (finite mass) terms in the free part appears here (for some derivations of the relativistic correction in the potential approach see [\cite=BYERS], [\cite=ZAL2]), and tends to reduce the coulombic interactions. On the other hand, at the b-quark mass scale, the dominance of the gluon condensate contribution indicates that the b-quark is not enough heavy for this system to be coulombic rendering the non-relativistic potential approach to be a crude approximation at this scale.

S31 - S10 hyperfine and P - S-wave splittings

In the non-relativistic approach à la [\cite=YND], the hyperfine and S - P wave splittings are given to leading order by:

[formula]

where CF = 4 / 3. Using the double ratio of moments and the QCD corrections given in Table 1, one obtains at σcoul:

[formula]

where the corrections are, respectively, relativistic, Coulombic and non-perturbative. By comparing the sum rules in Eqs. (8) and (13), one can realize that the leading x or 1 / σ-terms cancel in the hyperfine splitting, while the x-expansion is slowly convergent for the αs-term at the b-mass. Comparing now this result with the one from the non-relativistic approach, it is interesting to notice that both approaches lead to the same αs-behaviour of the Coulombic and gluon condensate contributions. A one to one correspondence of each QCD corrections is not very conclusive, and needs an evaluation of the correlator at the next-next-to-leading order for a better control of the α2sx terms. However, as the Coulombic potential is a fundamental aspect of QCD, we shall, however, expect that, after the resummation of the higher order terms in αs, the coefficient of the α4s-term in the hyperfine splitting will be the same in the two alternative approaches. In the case of the S - P wave splitting, the sum of the α2s corrections agrees from the two methods, though one can also notice that the relativistic correction is larger than the Coulombic one. The discrepancy for the coefficients of the gluon condensate in the two approaches is more subtle and may reflect the difficulty of Bell-Bertlmann [\cite=BERTM] to find a bridge between the field theory à la SVZ (flavour-dependent confining potential) and the potential models (flavour-independence). Resolving the diffferent puzzles encountered during this comparison is outside the scope of the present paper.

Leptonic width and quarkonia wave function

Using the sum rule LH and saturating it by the vector S31 state, we obtain, to a good approximation, the sum rule:

[formula]

where eQ is the quark charge in units of e; [formula] is the meson-quark mass gap. In the case of the b-quark, we use [\cite=SNM] δm≃0.26 GeV, and the value of σmin given in Eq. (10). Then:

[formula]

in agreement with the data 1.3 keV. However, one should remark from Eq. (14), that the αs correction is huge and needs an evaluation of the higher order terms (the gluon condensate effect is negligible), while the exponential factor effect is large, such that one can reciprocally use the data on the width to fix either αs or/and the quark mass. Larger value of the heavy quark mass at the two-loop level (see e.g. [\cite=VOL1]) corresponding to a negative value of δm, would imply a smaller value of the leptonic width in disagreement with the data.

In the non-relativistic approach, one can express the quarkonia leptonic width in terms of its wave function Ψ(0)Q:

[formula]

where (see e.g. [\cite=YND]):

[formula]

In our approah, one can deduce:

[formula]

Using the expression of σcoul, one can find that, to leading order, the two approaches give a similar behaviour for Ψ(0)Q in αs and in m and about the same value of this quantity, though, one should notice that in the present approach, the QCD coupling αs is evaluated at the scale σ as dictated by the renormalization group equation obeyed by the Laplace sum rule [\cite=SNR] but not at the resonance mass!

Gluon condensate from Mψ(S31) - Mηc(S10)

The value of σ, at which, the S-wave charmonium ratio of sum rules stabilize is: [\cite=BERT]:

[formula]

Using the range of the charm quark pole mass to order αs accuracy [\cite=SNM] : mc≃1.2 - 1.5 ~  one can deduce the conservative value of x:

[formula]

The ratio of the mass squared of the vector V(S31) and the pseudoscalar P(S10) is controlled by the double ratio of moments given generically in Eq. (6), where the exact expressions of the corrections read:

[formula]

where each terms lead to be about 0.5, 2 and 7 % of the leading order one. One can understand from the approximate expressions in Table 1 that the leading x-corrections appearing in the ratio of moments cancel in the double ratio, while the remaining corrections are relatively small. However, the x-expansion is not convergent for the αs-term at the charm mass, which invalidates the use of the 1 / m-expansion done in [\cite=DOMI] in this channel. Using for 4 flavours [\cite=SNM]: αs(σ)≃0.48+  0.17- 0.10, and the experimental data [\cite=PDG]: RexpVP  =  1.082, one can deduce the value of the gluon condensate:

[formula]

We have estimated the error due to higher order effects by replacing the coefficient of αs with the one obtained from the effective Coulombic potential, which tends to reduce the estimate to 0.07 GeV4. We have tested the convergence of the QCD series in σ, by using the numerical estimate of the dimension-six gluon condensate g〈fabcGaGbGc〉 contributions given in [\cite=PARK]. This effect is about 0.1% of the zeroth order term and does not influence the previous estimate in Eq. (22), which also indicates the good convergence of the ratio of exponential moments already at the charm mass scale in contrast with the q2 = 0 moments studied in Ref. [\cite=SVZ] [\cite=RADYU]. We also expect that in the double ratio of moments used here, the radiative corrections to the gluon condensate effects (their expression for the two-point correlator is however available in the literature [\cite=BROAD]) are much smaller than in the individual moments , such that they will give a negligible effect in the estimate of the gluon condensate. This value obtained at the same level of αs-accuracy as previous sum rule results, confirm the ones of Bell-Bertlmann [\cite=BELL] [\cite=BERT] [\cite=PARK] [\cite=BROAD] [\cite=SNB] from the ratio of exponential moments and from FESR-like sum rule for quarkonia [\cite=MILLER] [\cite=SNB] claiming that the SVZ value [\cite=SVZ] has been underestimated by about a factor 2 (see also [\cite=RADYU] [\cite=ZAL]). Our value is also in agreement with the more recent estimate (0.07  ±  0.01) ~ 4 from the τ-like sum rules [\cite=SNL], and FESR [\cite=FESR2] in e+e-  →  I = 1 hadrons. A more complete comparison of different determinations is done in Table 2.

Charmonium P-wave splittings

The analysis of the different ratios of moments for the P-wave charmonium shows [\cite=BELL]-[\cite=PARK] that they are optimized for:

[formula]

In the case of the Scalar P30 - axial P31 mass splitting, the different exact QCD coefficient corrections of the corresponding double ratio of moments read:

[formula]

Using the correlated values of the different parameters, one obtains the mass-splitting [formula] where we have used the experimental value MP31  =  3.51 GeV. Adding the 〈gG3〉 dimension-six condensate effect,which is about -1.6% of the leading term in R01, one can finally deduce the prediction in Table 2, which is in excellent agreement with the data . One should remark that the previous predictions indicate that, for the method to reproduce correctly the mass-splittings of the S and P-wave charmonium states, one needs both larger values of αs and 〈αsG2〉 than the ones favoured in the early days of the sum rules.

In the case of the Tensor P32-axial P31 mass splitting, the different exact QCD corrections for the double ratio of the tensor over the axial meson moments read:

[formula]

from which, one can deduce the prediction in Table 2, which is slightly higher than the data of 50 MeV. This small discrepancy may be attributed to the unaccounted effects of the dimension-six condensate or/and to the (usual) increasing role of the continuum for state with higher spins. However, the prediction is quite satisfactory within our approximation.

αs from the P11 - P31 axial mass splitting

The corresponding double ratio of moments has the nice feature to be independent of the gluon condensate to leading order in αs and reads:

[formula]

The recent experimental value of the P11 state denoted by hc(1P) in the PDG compilation [\cite=PDG] coincides with the one of the center of mass energy:

[formula]

as expected from the short range nature of the spin-spin force. We use the experimental value of the hc(1P) mass of 3526.1 MeV, and a naïve exponential resummation of the higher order αs terms. Then, we deduce:

[formula]

where The error is much bigger than the one from LEP and τ decay data, but its value is perfectly consistent with the later. The theoretical error is mainly due to the uncertainty in Δα, while a naïve resummation of the higher order αs terms leads the second error. However, though inaccurate, this value of αs is interesting for an alternative derivation of this fundamental quantity at lower energies, which can serve for testing its q2-evolution until MZ. Reciprocally, using the value of αs from LEP and τ-decay data as input, one can deduce the prediction of the center of mass (c.o.m) of the P3J states given in Table 2.

Υ  -  ηb mass splitting

For the bottomium, the analysis of the ratios of moments for the S and P waves shows that they are optimized at the same value of σ, namely [\cite=BERT]:

[formula]

which implies for 5 flavours: αs(σ)≃0.32  ±  0.06. Using the conservative values of the two-loop b-quark pole mass: mb≃4.2 - 4.7  ~  , one can deduce:

[formula]

where one might (a priori) expects a good convergence of the 1 / m expansion.

The splitting between the vector Υ(S31) and the pseudoscalar ηb(S10) can be done in a similar way than the charmonium one. The double ratio of moments reads numerically:

[formula]

where we have used the exact expressions of the QCD corrections. It leads to the mass splitting in Table 2. To this order of perturbation theory, this result is in the range of the potential model estimates [\cite=MARTIN] [\cite=BUCH] [\cite=YND], with the exception of the one in [\cite=LEUT] and [\cite=BYERS], where in the latter it has been shown that the square of the quark velocity v2 correction can cause a large value of about 100 MeV for the splitting. One should also notice that, to this approximation, the gluon condensate gives still the dominant effect at the b-mass scale (0.2% of the leading order) compared to the one .08% from the αs-term. However, the 1 / m series of the QCD αs correction is badly convergent, showing that the static limit approximation is quantitavely inaccurate in the b-channel. Therefore, one expects that the corresponding prediction of (13- 7+ 10) MeV is a very crude estimate. In order to control the effect of the unknown higher order terms, it is legitimate to introduce into the sum rule, the coefficient of the Coulombic effect from the QCD potential as given by the α2s-term in Eq. (12). Therefore, we deduce the "improved" final estimate in Table 2:

[formula]

implying the possible observation of the etab from the Upsilon radiative decay.

Υ  -  χb mass splittings and new estimate of the gluon condensate

As the S and P wave ratios of moments are optimized at the same value of σ, we can compare directly, with a good accuracy, the different P states with the Υ ~ (S31) one. As the coefficient of the α2s corrections, after inserting the expression of σmin, are comparable with the one from the Coulombic potential, we expect that the prediction of this splitting is more accurate than in the case of the hyperfine. The different double ratios of moments read numerically for the values in Eqs (28)-(29):

[formula]

where V, ~ S, ~ A, ~ T refer respectively to the Υ and to the different χb states P30, ~ P31, ~ P32. Using the value of the gluon condensate obtained previously, these sum rules lead to the mass-splittings in Table 2, which is in good agreement with the corresponding data, but definitely higher than the previous predictions of [\cite=VOL], where, among other effects, the values of αs and of the gluon condensate used there are too low. Reciprocally, one can use the data for re-extracting independently the value of the gluon condensate. As usually observed in the literature, the prediction is more accurate for the c.o.m., than for the individual mass. The corresponding numerical sum rule is:

[formula]

which leads to:

[formula]

We expect that this result is more reliable than the one obtained from the Mψ - Mηc as the latter can be more affected by the non calculated next-next-to-leading perturbative radiative corrections than the former. An average of the two results from the ψ  -  ηc and Υ  -  χb mass splittings leads to:

[formula]

where we have retained the most precise error. This result can be compared with different fits of the heavy and light quark channels given in Table 2, and which range from 4 (SVZ) to 14 in units of 10- 2  ~  4. The most recent estimate from e+e-  →  I = 1 hadrons data using τ-like decay is (7  ±  1)  ×  10- 2  ~  4, where one should also notice that the different post-SVZ estimates favour higher values of the gluon condensate. More accurate measurements of this quantity than the already available results from τ-decay data [\cite=DUFLOT] are needed for testing the previous phenomenological estimates from the sum rules.

Toponium: illustration of the infinite mass limit

Because in the alone case of the toponium, the 1 / m-expansion is ideal, we have extended the previous analysis in this channel, though, we are aware that this application can be purely academic because of the eventual inexistence of the corresponding bound states. We use the top mass: mt≃(173  ±  14) ~ , obtained from the average of the CDF candidates (174  ±  16) GeV and of the electroweak data (169  ±  26) GeV as compiled by PDG [\cite=PDG]. We shall work with the ratio of moments in the vector channel for determining the mass of the S31 state, and use with a good confidence the leading terms of the expressions given in Table 1. Using the sum rules in Eqs. (8) and (11) and the value of the minimum σ- 1 / 2≃20 ~  from Eq. (9), we deduce the result for the meson-quark mass gap given in Table 2. For the splittings, we use the sum rules in Eqs. (12) and (13), while, for the leptonic width, we use the sum rule in Eq. (14). Our results are summarized in Table 2.

Conclusions

We have used new double ratios of exponential sum rules for directly extracting the mass-splittings of different heavy quarkonia states. Therefore, we have obtained from Mψ - Mηc and Mχb - MΥ a more precise estimate of the value of the gluon condensate given in Eq. (34). We have also used Mχc(P11) - Mχc(P31) for an alternative extraction of αs at low energy (see Eq. (28)), with a value consistent with the one from LEP and τ-decay. Our numerical results are summarized in Table 2, where a comparison with different estimates and experimental data is done. We have not extended this analysis to the D-waves as these states are described with operators of higher dimensions, where, in general, the role of the continuum is relatively important and can obtruct the extraction of the mass-splittings. We have also attempted to connect the sum rules and the potential model approaches, using a 1 / m-expansion. We found, that the Coulombic corrections, which are quite well understood in QCD, agree, in general, in the two approaches, expect in the radiative corrections of the hyperfine splitting which requires the knowledge of the next-next-to-leading αs-corrections. Relativistic corrections due to finite value of the quark mass have been included in our analysis. However, the coefficients of the gluon condensate disagree in the two approaches, which may be related to the difficulty encountered by Bell-Bertlmann in finding a bridge between a field theory à la SVZ and potential models.
