In modern theories of (equilibrium) critical phenomena, the notions of scaling and universality play a central role. These notions are particularly useful when applied to finite systems using finite-size scaling techniques, see [\cite=Priv94] for an extensive review. In this work, we study the effects of varying the spin quantum number on the thermodynamics of the well-known XY quantum chain in a transverse field. For spin [formula], this model is exactly integrable in terms of free fermions and many of its properties are well studied, see [\cite=Kats62] [\cite=Burk87]. Besides being of interest in its own right (i.e. for the influence of the quantum effects on the order parameter profile [\cite=Henk95]), this quantum Hamiltonian also arises from the master equation description of several non-equilibrium statistical systems, see [\cite=Gryn94]. Here we consider the spin-1 variant of this model, with the Hamiltonian

[formula]

where h is the transverse field, η measures the spin anisotropy, ζ is a normalization constant and N is the system size. We use periodic boundary conditions. Finally, the Sx,y,z are spin-1 matrices

[formula]

(Spin-1 Ising models were recently proposed to describe the adsorption of CO on graphite, see [\cite=Wiec93].) We are interested in the ground state energy E0, which plays the role of the equilibrium free energy (for reviews see [\cite=Priv90] [\cite=Chri93]) and in the correlation lengths ξi, related to the exponential decay of two-point correlation functions, given by the energy gaps ξ- 1i  =  Ei  -  E0. We calculate the low-lying spectrum of H for finite N (up to N = 14) using the Lanczos algorithm and then extrapolate towards N  →    ∞  , see [\cite=Chri93] for details. The quantum Hamiltonian H commutes with the charge operator Q, the parity operator P and the translation operator T defined by

[formula]

Eigenstates of H are thus characterized by the eigenvalues of Q,P and T, which serves to block-diagonalize H.

Our first task is to determine the phase diagram, shown in Fig. 1. We recognize three distinct phases. The first transition, between the paramagnetic phase P and the ferromagnetic phase F, is found from conventional finite-size scaling and will be shown below to be in the 2D Ising universality class. Close to a conventional critical point of second order, the following finite-size scaling form for the inverse correlation lengths is expected [\cite=Priv84] [\cite=Priv94]

[formula]

where hc  =  hc(η) is the critical point, y = 2 - xε a critical exponent, C is a non-universal metric factor and Si is a universal  scaling function. In particular, from 2D conformal invariance, it follows that Si(0)  =  2πxi [\cite=Card84], where xi is a universal critical exponent. Now, the critical point hc can be found from phenomenological renormalization [\cite=Priv90]. The results, extrapolated to N  →    ∞  , are displayed in table [\ref=tab1]. For η = 1 we find agreement with the earlier result [\cite=Gehl94] hc≃1.3259.

The second transition occurs between the ferromagnetic phase F and a new 'oscillatory' phase O. This transition is well known for the spin-[formula] case [\cite=Kats62] and occurs along the line h = ho(η) where

[formula]

For spin-[formula] it is known that while in the F phase the connected spin-spin correlation function < SxRSx0  >  c decays monotonously with R, the oscillatory phase is characterized by a new wave vector K which modulates the spin-spin correlator [\cite=Kats62]

[formula]

Furthermore, in the oscillatory phase there are level crossings in the ground state energy which occur already for finite values of the number of sites N [\cite=Hoe85] [\cite=Henk95]. It was shown in [\cite=Hoe85] that the location hk(N) of the k-th level crossing satisfies a finite-size scaling law

[formula]

where the exponent ν describes the scaling of the wave vector K  ~  (ho - h)ν in the vicinity of the O/F transition line (for h  ≤  ho ). For spin [formula], it is known that ν = 1 / 2 [\cite=Hoe85].

We now ask whether a similar transition occurs for larger values of S. Indeed, it is known that for arbitrary spin S and periodic boundary conditions, the ground state energy of H is doubly degenerate at h = ho(η) [\cite=Kur82]. For spin S = 1, we have checked numerically that the first ground state level crossing h1(N) always occurs at h = ho(η) for all finite N. In addition, the second crossing h2(N) converges towards ho(η), as apparent from the extrapolated data in table [\ref=tab2]. The exponent found from eq. ([\ref=zeros]) is consistent with ν≃1 / 2, independently of η and in agreement with the exact result for spin-[formula]. This supports universality along the F/O transition line. In fact, having confirmed the same finite-size scaling behaviour of the level crossings in the ground state energy for both spin [formula] and S = 1, we expect the features of the oscillatory phase known [\cite=Kats62] [\cite=Hoe85] from [formula] to be present for S = 1 as well.

From now on, we concentrate on the P/F transition line. We expect this transition to be in the 2D Ising universality class, if η  ≠  0. To see this, we compare the low-lying excitation spectrum of H with the prediction of conformal invariance [\cite=Card87] [\cite=Chri93], following the steps outlined for the spin-[formula] case in [\cite=Chri93]. Conformal field theory states that, after subtraction of a purely extensive term, H can be written in the form

[formula]

where c is the central charge and L0, 0 are generators of the Virasoro algebra which acts as a dynamical symmetry for H. As a consequence, eigenstates can be grouped into 'conformal towers', each represented by exactly one primary operator with conformal weights (Δ,). The scaling dimension of the corresponding eigenstate is x = Δ  +  . The scaled energies and momenta take the form

[formula]

[formula]

with I, Ī integer. EΔ,,PΔ,, respectively, are the eigenvalues of H,i ln T and E0 is the ground state energy. However, the application of these relations requires that the scaled energies E and momenta P are measured in the same units, thus fixing the normalization ζ of H accordingly. We find ζ by demanding that E0,0(2,0) = 2 throughout [\cite=Card87]. The results for ζ are given in table [\ref=tab1].

Next, we determine the central charge. For η = 1, we find c = 0.49999(1), close to the expected [formula] for the 2D Ising universality class. We did not compute c explicitly for other values of η, but expect c to be η-independent. In order to check the complete operator content, we give the extrapolated values of the scaled energies in the charge sectors Q = 0 and Q = 1 in tables [\ref=tab3] and [\ref=tab4]. When comparing these spectra to the expected operator content of the 2D Ising model [\cite=Card87] [\cite=Chri93], namely for the Q = 0 sector the conformal towers generated by the primary operators (0,0) and ([formula],[formula]) (which correspond to the vacuum 1 and the energy density ε) and for the Q = 1 sector the conformal tower generated by ([formula],[formula]) (which corresponds to the order parameter density σ), we find complete agreement. In particular, we read off the scaling dimensions [formula] and xε = 1 which determine the bulk critical exponents.

We now look at the finite-size scaling functions for the spin-spin and energy-energy correlation lengths ξ- 1σ,ε  =  N- 1Sσ,ε(Cσ,εz), see eq. ([\ref=scaling]). From universality with [formula], we expect [\cite=Burk87]

[formula]

[formula]

where z = N(h - hc) is the finite-size scaling variable and [formula] is a remnant function [\cite=Fish72]. The spin-dependence should only enter into the metric factors Cσ and Cε which are determined from Sσ and Sε, respectively. In Figure 2, we display the extrapolated finite-size data of Sσ,ε for η = 0.7 and find that they match nicely with the expected functional form. This confirms universality. Similar plots are obtained for other values of η. The results for the metric factors are collected in table [\ref=tab5]. Our results are consistent with

[formula]

It is interesting to compare these with the conformal normalization ζ(η) from table [\ref=tab1]. Our data are roughly consistent with a linear relation C- 1(η)  =  α  ·  ζ(η) with α≃0.75.

A few comments are in order. Firstly, the observation eq. ([\ref=CRes]) that the numerical value of the metric factor is independent of the physical quantity used for its determination, is certainly in agreement with the scaling expectation eq. ([\ref=scaling]) [\cite=Priv94]. Similar results were recently reported for 2D percolation [\cite=Hu95], where it was also checked that the metric factors are independent of the boundary conditions. Secondly, our results confirm earlier work [\cite=Debi87] on the universality of the finite-size scaling function Sσ in the 2D spin-1 Ising model. Thirdly, the observed linear relation between the conformal normalization ζ and the metric factor C can be understood in terms of conformal perturbation theory, see [\cite=Card87] [\cite=Chri93]. In that framework, one would write for the non-critical quantum Hamiltonian [formula], where Hc is the critical point quantum Hamiltonian, φ a perturbing relevant operator and g a non-universal coupling. In our case, φ  =  ε, the energy density and g  =  h - hc. Since a given quantum Hamiltonian must in general be normalized to make conformal invariance applicable (see above), we note that into a perturbative calculation of the energy spectrum only the finite-size scaling variable N2 - xφ(h - hc) / ζ enters. That is consistent with our finding C  ~  ζ- 1.

In conclusion, we have investigated the ground state phase diagram of the spin-1 quantum XY chain in a transverse magnetic field. The structure of the phase diagram, obtained from finite-size scaling, is found to be very similar to the known spin-[formula] case. We have explicitly confirmed the universality of the Ising line, with respect to the spin S as well as the spin anisotropy η, considering both the conformal operator content and the finite-size scaling functions of the first two correlation lengths.
