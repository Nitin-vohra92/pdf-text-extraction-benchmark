ABSTRACT

We discuss the Λb-polarization of the bottom baryon Λb in its production and in its decay. Standard Model predictions for b-quark polarization on the Z-peak are reviewed, including beam-quark orientation effects and O(αs) radiative corrections to the polarization. The b-quark polarization is expected to be handed over to the Λb into which it fragments with a high degree of efficiency. We present several spin-momentum correlation measures of the spin of the Λb with the momenta of its decay products in its inclusive semileptonic decay. We estimate the strengths of the spin-momentum correlations in the Free Quark Decay (FQD) model and find that some of the measures provide good or very good analyzing power for measuring the polarization of the Λb.

Introduction

This presentation will cover four different topics, all relevant for the polarization of Λb's from Z-decays. Interest in the subject of Λb-polarization was sparked by a recent LEP measurement of Λb-polarization by the ALEPH-collaboration, which found a rather small value for the Λb-polarization, smaller than SM-expectations by about one standard deviation [\cite=strass1].

The first topic concerns the polarization of b-quarks produced on the Z-peak which turns out to be rather large (93%) in the Standard Model (SM). Recently the O(αs) corrections to the polarization of the b-quarks have been calculated [\cite=strass2] [\cite=strass3] [\cite=strass4]. The O(αs) corrections to the Born term values for the polarization turn out to be rather small. The second topic concerns the polarization transfer of the polarization of the b-quarks to the Λb's which can be expected to be rather efficient in as much as the polarization transfer is 100% in the heavy quark limit [\cite=strass5]. In the third part we briefly discuss the description of inclusive semileptonic Λb decays using the operator product expansion (OPE) method within Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) [\cite=strass6] [\cite=strass7]. The main result is that the leading contribution to the decay is given by the usual free quark decay (FQD) amplitude with small O(1 / m2b) corrections. In the last part we give a brief discussion of how the Λb polarization was determined by the ALEPH experiment and suggest improvements on the ALEPH measurement. In particular we propose to measure the Λb polarization through spin-momentum correlations of the spin of the Λb with the momenta of its decay products.

b-Quark Polarization on the Z-Peak

Because of the small value of sin 2θW the neutral current coupling of the Z to quark pairs is dominantly left-chiral. Also, since the quark masses are small on the scale of the Z-mass, quark mass effects can practically be neglected in the production process, and thus the produced quarks are predicted to emerge strongly polarized. The polarization effect is strongest for the T3 =  - 1 / 2 (Q =  - 1 / 3) quarks with 93% left-handed polarisation, and somewhat reduced for the T3 = 1 / 2 (Q = 2 / 3) with 60% left polarization. The polarization is mainly longitudinal with small transverse polarization components. The latter are suppressed by the factor mb / mZ and thus small.

In Fig. 1 we plot the cos θ-dependence of the alignment polarization [formula] (often also called the longitudinal polarization) of the b-quark on the Z-peak. The angle θ is the polar angle of the quark relative to the e--beam direction. The alignment polarisation [formula] shown in Fig. 1 is large and negative and shows very little cos θ-dependence. Note that the O(αs) radiative corrections are small. They never amonunt to more than 2% over the whole cos θ-range. As mentioned before the transverse components are quite small and can be neglected for all practical purposes, in particular when they are averaged over the relative beam-quark orientation [\cite=strass3].

Polarization Transfer [formula]

Given that the b-quark from Z-decays has a large negative longitudinal polarization one has to face the issue of how efficiently this polarization is transferred to the Λb. Suppose first that the polarized b-quark picks up a spin-0 ud pair to form a 'prompt' Λb. Due to its ud pair having spin 0, all of the Λb spin resides on the valence b-quark and we expect b polarization to become Λb-polarization (in the heavy quark limit where b spin-flip is suppressed during hadronization). Suppose instead that the polarized b-quark had combined with a spin-1 ud pair to form a Σb or a Σ*b. In the heavy quark limit these two states would form a degenerate pair of states, i.e. the b-quark polarization would again be handed down to the Λb when the coherent superposition of the two Σb and Σ*b states decay into the Λb. The same reasoning applies to any of the other degenerate excited Heavy Quark Symmetry doublets decaying into the Λb. The conclusion is that the b-quark polarization is transferred to the Λb with 100% efficiency in the heavy quark limit [\cite=strass5]. In real life the Heavy Quark Symmetry doublets are not quite degenerate which can be appreciated to lead to a reduction in the efficiency factor of the polarization transfer by the above line of reasoning [\cite=strass5] [\cite=strass8]. Falk and Peskin have attempted to estimate the reduction factor and conclude that one retains an efficiency factor of [formula]% in the polarization transfer from b-quarks to Λb's [\cite=strass8].

Theoretical Framework for Inclusive Semileptonic Decays

Next we turn to the description of the semileptonic inclusive decays of the Λb. Recently there have been important advances in our understanding of these decays using OPE and HQET techniques [\cite=strass6] [\cite=strass7]. The heavy mass scale in these decays allows one to perform an OPE-expansion of the bilocal product of weak currents appearing in the rate expressions. This procedure is quite similar in spirit to the OPE-expansion in deep inelastic scattering where q2 sets the large energy scale. Matrix elements of the operators appearing in the OPE-expansion are parametrized in terms of a set of basic nonperturbative parameters using HQET-methods. An important result of this analysis is that to lowest order in the heavy quark mass expansion one recovers the usual parton model result corresponding to Free Quark Decay (FQD). Corrections to FQD start appearing only at O(1 / m2b) and are therefore small. Because of the fact that the O(1 / m2b) corrections are so small we shall, for the sake of simplicity, base our following discussion on the FQD results. A treatment of the O(1 / m2b) and O(αs) [\cite=strass9] corrections can be found in [\cite=strass10].

The first experimental determination of the Λb polarization by the ALEPH-collaboration gave the intriguingly small value [\cite=strass1]. The measurement was based on a proposal by Bonvicini and Randall to determine the Λb polarization by a measurement of the ratio of the average of the electron and neutrino energies y = 〈Ee〉  /  〈Eν〉 [\cite=strass14]. Compared to the well-tested method of determining the muon's polarization from the shape of the electron spectrum in its semileptonic decay one is here suffering from the fact that the momentum of the Λb is practically not known in the corresponding semileptonic Λb decay, i.e. there is no unpolarized reference spectrum to compare with. The advantage of the Bonvicini-Randall measure is that any fragmentation dependence practically drops out of the ratio of averages of electron and neutrino energies.

The polarization of the Λb directly affects the spectra of the elctron (or muon) and the ν produced in its semileptonic decays. The qualitative nature of the change can be obtained by an examination of the angular decay distributions of the leptons in the rest frame of the decaying Λb. The electrons (or muons) tend to be emitted antiparallel to the spin of the Λb and the ν's are emitted preferentially parallel to its spin [\cite=strass9]. In the lab frame this translates into a harder electron spectrum and a softer neutrino spectrum as compared to the unpolarized case. It goes without saying that this is a difficult measurement since one needs to reconstruct the neutrino energy in the decays. In fact the difficulty in the reconstruction of the neutrino energy is the main source of the rather large errors quoted in the measurement of the ALEPH-collaboration. Possible optimizations of spectra-related measures have been investigated in [\cite=strass10] where the measure y2  =  〈E2e〉  /  〈E2ν〉 was found to be a good candidate to reduce the errors in this measurement.

Spin-Momentum Correlations in Inclusive Semileptonic Decays of Polarized Λb's

In Ref.[\cite=strass11] we investigated the potential of using spin-momentum correlations between the spin of the Λb and the momenta of its decay products to determine the polarization of the Λb. Consider a polarized Λb in its rest frame situated at the origin of a coordinate system with its polarization vector pointing into the (θ,φ)-direction as depicted in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. In Fig. 2 the z-axis is in the (x,z)-decay plane. Such a coordinate system is referred to as a helicity system. In Fig. 3 the z-axis is perpendicular to the decay plane, which now is in the (x,y)-plane. Such a system will be referred to as a transversity system. The orientation of the polarization vector is given in terms of the polar angle θ and φ in the helicity system and in terms of θT and φT in the transversity system.

We begin our discussion with the helicity system. The two-fold angular decay distribution in the helicity system is given by the expression [\cite=strass11] [\cite=strass12] [\cite=strass13]

[formula]

where the polarization is now defined as [formula]. The values of the angular coefficients A, B and C depend on the decay dynamics and on whether the momentum of the electron (system I) or the momentum of the recoiling hadron system (system II) is used to define the z-direction in the helicity system. Instead of analyzing the two-fold decay distribution we reduce the decay distribution Eq. ([\ref=eqn1]) to single angle decay distributions by the appropiate θ and φ integrations. We obtain

[formula]

where, in terms of the angular coefficients A, B and C defined above, the asymmetry parameters are given by αP = B / A and γP  =  πC / 4A.

In Table [\ref=tab1] we list the values of the asymmetry parameters in the FQD model for b  →  c and b  →  u transitions in system I and II, respectively. The asymmetry measures are large enough to provide useful measures for the determination of the polarization of the Λb. The azimuthal asymmetry tends to be somewhat larger than the polar asymmetry. For the case b  →  c the polar asymmetry αP in system I (where the electron defines the z-axis) is smaller than that in system II (see also [\cite=strass9]). The azimuthal asymmetry is approximately the same in both systems and is quite close to its mass zero value γP =  - 0.56. For the decay into a mass zero quark as the u-quark the asymmetry values in system I and II coincide. This is a simple consequence of the fact that the u-quark and the electron are Fierz symmetry partners in the decay. In the case of mass degeneracy as is the case here the decay distributions are symmetric under the exchange of the two.

In order to draw the analogy to muon decay we arrange the decay products in muon decay in the same weak isospin order as in the b  →  u case. One has

[formula]

where we have added the braces connecting the Fierz partners for emphasis. The result for the polar asymmetry parameter αP =  - 1 / 3 is well familiar from muon decay when the mass of the electron is neglected. The corresponding value γP =  - 2π2 / 35 for the azimuthal asymmetry parameter has not been widely publicized in the muon decay case for the obvious reason that the azimuthal asymmetry cannot be measured with two undetected neutrinos in the final state.

Next we turn to the transversity system as drawn in Fig. 3. The relation between the transversity angles (θT, φT) and the helicity angles (θ, φ) can be easily seen to be given by

[formula]

Correspondingly one has the two-fold angular decay distribution

[formula]

Integrating Eq. ([\ref=eqn2]) over φT leads to a flat cos θT-distribution while integrating over cos θT one obtains the one-fold angular decay distribution

[formula]

[formula]

and the phase angle β is given by

[formula]

In Table [\ref=tab2] we list the FQD values of the asymmetry parameter γTP and the phase angle β, again for b  →  c and b  →  u transitions in the two respective systems I and II. The asymmetry parameter is large and negative in both systems.

As in the case of the helicity systems the values of the asymmetry parameter γTP and the phase angle β agree for systems I and II for the b  →  u transitions. In fact, mass effects of the final quark play no important role altogether as can be seen by comparing the b  →  c case with the b  →  u case.

In conclusion the polarization measures discussed in this talk should prove useful in analyzing the polarization of Λb-quarks. They complement the spectrum related measures discussed in [\cite=strass10] [\cite=strass14]. Acknowledgement: I would like to thank my collaborators C. Diaconu, S. Groote, D. Pirjol, M.
