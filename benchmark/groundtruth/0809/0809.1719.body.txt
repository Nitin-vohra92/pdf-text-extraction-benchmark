Duality in spaces of finite linear combinations of atoms

Lemma

Introduction

For each 0 < p  ≤  1 consider the space Fp of finite linear combinations of (p,  ∞  )-atoms, endowed with its natural norm (or quasi-norm for p < 1)

[formula]

where [formula] denotes a finite sum. Recall that a is a (p,  ∞  )-atom if a is a measurable function supported on a ball B, satisfying the cancellation condition

[formula]

and the size condition

[formula]

The space Fp is clearly contained in [formula], the standard real Hardy space on [formula]. The elements of Hp are the distributions that admit an atomic decomposition, [formula], converging in the sense of distributions, for some (p,  ∞  )-atoms aj and scalars λj with [formula] (for p = 1, H1  ⊂  L1 and atomic sums converge in the L1-norm). In [\cite=MTW] Meyer,Taibleson and Weiss observed that the Fp-norm is not comparable to the Hp-norm on Fp . Recently, it was shown in [\cite=B] that the Meyer-Taibleson-Weiss result leads to the following conclusion in the case p = 1: there exists a bounded linear functional on F1 which does not extend to a bounded linear functional on H1. In other words, there is a linear operator which is uniformly bounded on (1,  ∞  )-atoms but does not extend to a bounded linear operator on H1.

In this paper we describe the structure of the completion [formula] of Fp, [formula], and of its dual space. We show in particular that, when p < 1, Fp and Hp have the same dual, and therefore no example like the one in [\cite=B] can be exhibited for p < 1. An immediate consequence of this is that if 0 < p < 1 and the linear operator

[formula]

maps Fp into a Banach space B satisfying the inequality

[formula]

for some positive constant C and all (p,  ∞  )-atoms, then T extends to a bounded linear operator from Hp into B. The argument proceeds by duality as follows. Take any u in the dual B* of B. Since [formula] ,

[formula]

and so, by the dual expression of the norm in a Banach space,

[formula]

We prove the following facts about [formula] 0  <  p  ≤  1.

The closed subspace [formula] of [formula] spanned by the continuous (p,  ∞  )-atoms is isomorphic to Hp as a Banach space, and [formula] splits as the direct sum of [formula] and a non-trivial complementary closed subspace Np.

Every element ξ of [formula] admits an atomic decomposition

[formula]

for (p,  ∞  )-atoms aj and scalars λj with [formula]. Moreover, the [formula]-norm of ξ is equivalent to its atomic norm

[formula]

If an atomic sum [formula], with λj and aj as above, converges to 0 in [formula], it also converges to 0 in Hp, but not viceversa. In fact, Np consists of those elements of [formula] that are represented by atomic sums converging to 0 in Hp.

In other words, Hp and [formula] are both quotients of the space of "formal series" of (p,  ∞  )-atoms with [formula] coefficients, but the equivalence relation defining [formula] is finer than that defining Hp.

So, the reason why (F1)* is strictly larger than (H1)* is that it is the direct sum of [formula] and (N1)*. Notice that (N1)* is non-trivial, as the dual of the non-trivial Banach space N1. On the other hand, it turns out that (Np)* is trivial for p < 1.

To describe our results we need to introduce some notation and recall some basic classical facts in the theory of Banach algebras (see Section [\ref=proof] for details).

Denote by [formula] the space of bounded measurable functions on [formula] vanishing at infinity. Then [formula] is a commutative C*-algebra without unit, and its maximal ideal space is a locally compact, non-compact space, which we call [formula] (cf. [\cite=F]).

By the Gelfand-Naimark theorem, the Gelfand transform f  →   establishes an isometric isomorphism between [formula] and the algebra C0() of all continuous functions on [formula] vanishing at ∞  . On the other hand, [formula] is a closed subalgebra of [formula], and its maximal ideal space is [formula]. This embedding induces a continuous projection π from [formula] onto [formula]. Clearly, if [formula], then [formula].

In a similar way, given any ball B in [formula], the maximal ideal space of L∞(B) is a compact space B̂, endowed with a projection πB onto [formula] induced by the inclusion of C() in L∞(B). Moreover, [formula], again by the Gelfand-Naimark theorem.

The restriction map f  ↦  f|B from [formula] to L∞(B) induces a natural embedding ιB:B̂  →  , which is compatible with the projections π and πB, in the sense that

[formula]

Similar embeddings ιB,B':  →  B̂ exist for pairs of balls B,B' with B'  ⊂  B, with the same compatibility with respect to the corresponding projections.

Denote by m the Lebesgue measure on [formula]. The continuous linear functional [formula] on L∞(B) is represented by a positive Borel measure B on B̂, that is,

[formula]

If B is contained in a second ball B', then the restriction of B' to B̂ is precisely B and thus we can define a positive Borel measure [formula] globally on [formula] by requiring that its restriction to B̂ be B for each ball B.

We can now state our main result.

It is clear that relation [\eqref=eq2] determines the function b and the measure μ uniquely. Therefore (F1)* differs from (H1)*  =  BMO by the presence of the complementary subspace S of singular measures satisfying [\eqref=eq1]. We will show that S is non-trivial; in fact, the Meyer, Taibleson and Weiss argument may be interpreted as the construction of a non-zero measure in S. The decomposition of (F1)* as [formula] is the dual counterpart of the decomposition of [formula] as [formula] although S and BMO do not coincide with the annihilators of [formula] and N1 respectively.

The nature of the elements of Np, including p = 1, is somehow mysterious. It is not clear at all to us if they can be represented by concrete analytic objects.

Section [\ref=completion] contains the discussion of the completion of Fp and a constructive argument which proves the non-triviality of Np. In Section [\ref=proof] we prove the Theorem. We also give an example of a non-zero singular measure satisfying [\eqref=eq1].

We remark here that a variation of the main argument in the proof of the Theorem provides an alternative proof of some results in [\cite=MSV] and [\cite=YZ]) on the equivalence of the finite and infinite atomic norms of (1,q)-atoms, q <   ∞  , and on extension of bounded operators defined on finite linear combinations of (p,q)-atoms with 1 < q  <    ∞  .

The completion of Fp

Let Fp,  c stand for the subspace of Hp consisting of finite linear combinations of continuous (p,  ∞  ) atoms. A surprising recent result in [\cite=MSV] states that the Hp and the Fp norms are equivalent on Fp,c  ,  0 < p  ≤  1. Indeed, the result is proved in [\cite=MSV] only for p = 1, but, as suggested in Remark 3.2 there, the same argument extends to the case 0 < p < 1.

More precisely, we can quote Lemma 3.1 and Remark 3.2 in [\cite=MSV] as follows.

The following norms are equivalent on Fp,c:

the Hp-norm;

the Fp-norm [\eqref=eq0];

the Fp,c-norm

[formula]

Since Fp,c is dense in Hp, the natural inclusion of Fp,c in Fp extends uniquely to a continuous linear operator T from Hp to [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lemmaMSV], T maps Hp isomorphically onto the closure [formula] of Fp,c in [formula] Notice that, again by Lemma [\ref=lemmaMSV], [formula] is the completion of Fp,c endowed either with the norm [formula] or with the norm inherited from Fp.

On the other hand, the inclusion of Fp (endowed with its natural norm) into Hp is continuous, and it extends to a continuous linear operator U from [formula] to Hp. We then have the diagram

[formula]

with [formula] being the identity map. In particular U is surjective. Set [formula] so that P is a projection, that is, P2 = P. The kernel of P is the kernel of U, which we denote by Np, and the kernel of I - P is [formula]. Hence we get the topological direct sum decomposition

[formula]

Notice that Np is non-trivial, since otherwise the Hp and the Fp norms would be comparable on Fp.

To better understand the space [formula] we prove now the following.

Given any sequence of (p,  ∞  ) atoms aj and any [formula]-sequence of scalars λj, the series [formula] converges in [formula] to an element ξ such that [formula]. Conversely, each [formula] can be written as

[formula]

where each aj is a (p,  ∞  ) atom and the sum is convergent in [formula]. Moreover,

[formula]

where the infimum is taken over all decompositions [\eqref=eq4bis] of ξ.

Let ξ be an element of [formula]. To prove [\eqref=eq4bis], express ξ as the limit in [formula] of a sequence Sk of elements of Fp. Given ε > 0, we may assume that [formula] and that [formula] Thus

[formula]

Set

[formula]

where the above expression of has been chosen so that

[formula]

Similarly, set

[formula]

with

[formula]

Then [formula] and the partial sums [formula] form a Cauchy sequence in Fp. This shows that [\eqref=eq4bis] holds.

Notice also that, for each [formula] the inequality [formula], where the infimum is taken over all possible expressions [\eqref=eq4bis], is due to the fact that [formula] satisfies the triangle inequality.

The atomic decomposition of elements of [formula] given above provides an explicit description of the operator U.

Let [formula] be represented by the sum [\eqref=eq4bis]. Then U(ξ) is the sum of the same series in Hp.

We end this section by providing a constructive proof of the non triviality of Np. Let us first describe the Meyer, Taibleson and Weiss construction as presented in [\cite=B]. Let B denote the open ball centered at the origin with radius 1. Take a sequence of open disjoint balls Bj  ,j  ≥  1  , such that [formula] is dense in B  . Notice that we may also choose the Bj so that the Lebesgue measure of their union [formula] is as small as we wish. As shown in [\cite=B] , for each j there exists a (non-continuous) (p,  ∞  ) atom aj supported on Bj with the property that [formula] where c is a small positive constant depending only on n. Thus, setting

[formula]

we get |f|  ≥  c on [formula] From that is not difficult to conclude (see [\cite=B]) that

[formula]

On the other hand, we clearly have [formula], so that the ratio between Hp-norm and Fp-norm can be made as small as we wish.

We can now construct a sequence {fm} in Fp satisfying

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The first two conditions imply that {fm} has a non-zero limit [formula], whereas the third implies that Ufm = fm tends to 0 in Hp. Hence ξ∈Np.

The functions fm have the form [\eqref=MTW], precisely

[formula]

where, for each m, {Bmj}j is a disjoint family of balls contained in B with dense union and small total measure, and each amj is a (p,  ∞  )-atom with [formula].

The first function f1 can be any function as in [\eqref=MTW] with, say, [formula]. We then construct inductively fm + 1 from fm as follows.

Take N so large that [formula]. Inside each Bmj  ,1  ≤  j  ≤  N  , we take open disjoint balls B'j  l  ,l  ≥  1  , such that [formula] is dense in Bmj and [formula]

Then

[formula]

Let a'j  l be a (p,  ∞  ) atom supported on B'j  l with [formula]. Set

[formula]

Since |fm + 1|  ≥  c on an open dense subset of B, [formula]. Moreover,

[formula]

For each j, the function

[formula]

is supported on Bmj and its absolute value is not greater than 2  . Hence

[formula]

We relabel now the balls in such a way that [formula], and rename the atoms in fm + 1 as am + 1j accordingly. Then, inductively from [\eqref=volume],

[formula]

for every m, and the required estimates can be easily verified.

Proof of the Theorem

We start by proving, for the reader's sake, a few statements made (explicitly or not) in the last part of the introduction concerning the Gelfand spectrum [formula] and its projection π on [formula].

The first statement we want to prove is that π is in fact well defined. Given φ in [formula], i.e., a nontrivial multiplicative functional on [formula], it is clear that its restriction to [formula] is also multiplicative. We must show that this restriction is evaluation at some point x = π(φ) of [formula], or, equivalently, that it is not identically zero.

Since [formula] is a C*-algebra, it is symmetric, so that [formula] for every f. Therefore, [formula] implies that [formula], so that φ is monotonic on real-valued functions. If φ vanishes identically on [formula], it also vanishes on characteristic functions of compact sets. By linearity and continuity, this would be a contradiction.

The second statement is that the mapping π is surjective. We know that to each φ∈ we can associate a point π(φ) in [formula]. Given [formula], we can define a translate τyφ∈ by

[formula]

It is quite clear that π(τyφ) = π(φ) + y. Since [formula] is nonempty, π is surjective.

The last statement which remained unproved in the introduction is that [formula] is the union of the B̂ over all balls B. This is a direct consequence of (ii) in the following lemma.

Let B be an open ball in [formula] Then

[formula]

where [formula] stands for the Gelfand transform of [formula].

[formula]

To prove [\eqref=eq4] notice that φ(χB) is either 0 or 1 by the multiplicative property.

If φ(χB) = 1, then [formula], which means that φ factors through a character of L∞(B). Thus φ∈B̂. The argument can be reversed, so [\eqref=eq4] is proved.

Assume now that for some φ∈ we have π(φ)∈B. Let f be a continuous function on [formula], with f(π(φ)) = 1 and compact support contained in B. Then fχB  =  f and so

[formula]

Then φ∈B̂ because of [\eqref=eq4].

If π(φ) is not in [formula], then there is a continuous function f on [formula], with f(π(φ)) = 1 and compact support in [formula] Thus fχB  =  0 and so φ(χB) = 0, that is, φ is not in B̂.

We turn now to the proof of the Theorem. We begin by discussing the converse statement in part (A) of the Theorem. Obviously, given b∈BMO, the linear functional [formula] is bounded on [formula] with a norm controlled from above by the BMO-norm of b. On the other hand, restriction of the functional to [formula] gives a control from below by the same BMO-norm.

We first remark that [\eqref=eq4] clearly implies that, given [formula], the support of f is contained in B if and only if the support of [formula] is contained in B̂.

Let μ be a Radon measure on [formula] satisfying [\eqref=eq1]. For each (1,  ∞  )-atom a supported on a ball B one has

[formula]

Hence μ determines a bounded linear functional on [formula].

Assume now that [formula] is a bounded linear functional on F1. Fix a ball B and let L∞0(B) stand for the set of functions in L∞(B) with zero integral. Given f∈L∞0(B),

[formula]

is a (1,  ∞  )-atom. Thus

[formula]

The restriction of [formula] to L∞0(B) extends to a bounded linear functional on L∞(B) = C(B̂). Thus there exists a measure νB on B̂ such that

[formula]

If f∈L∞(B), then clearly B̂  =  fB, where gE stands for the mean of the function g on the set E with respect to the underlying measure ([formula] or m in the case at hand). Then

[formula]

for each f∈L∞(B). Therefore, if νB represents [formula] on L∞0(B), that is, if [\eqref=eq6] holds, then [formula] is uniquely determined.

Let BN stand for the open ball with center at the origin and radius N, N = 1,2,... Take any measure ν1 on [formula] that represents [formula] on L∞0(B1). Each other such measure differs from ν1 by a constant multiple of [formula] By the preceding remark applied to BN there exists a unique measure νN on [formula] which represents [formula] on L∞0(BN) and νN(B1) = ν1(B1). Clearly νN restricted to [formula] is precisely νN - 1. Therefore we can define a measure ν on [formula] by requiring that ν restricted to [formula] be νN.

Given any ball B take N such that B  ⊂  BN. Since the restriction of ν to [formula] represents [formula] on L∞0(BN), which contains L∞0(B), the restriction of ν to B̂ represents [formula] on L∞0(B) as well. By [\eqref=eq7] or

[formula]

Let us now consider the Radon-Nikodym decomposition of ν

[formula]

where [formula] and μ is singular with respect to . By [\eqref=eq9]

[formula]

and

[formula]

We are left with the task of finding the BMO-function b.

Combining [\eqref=eq10] and [\eqref=eq11] we readily get

[formula]

We need a Lemma.

For each function [formula] there exists a unique function [formula] with the property that for each ball B,

[formula]

Such f satisfies

[formula]

for each ball B.

Once the lemma is proved we complete the proof of part (A) of the Theorem by just calling b the function f associated with g in Lemma 2. Inequality [\eqref=eq12] tells us that [formula] and that its [formula] norm is not greater than [formula]

We will show that for each ball B the Gelfand transform, which is an isometry between L∞(B) and C(B̂), extends to an isometry between L1(B,m) and L1(B̂,). This immediately provides a further extension of the Gelfand transform to a topological isomorphism between [formula] and [formula]

We begin by showing that, for each ball B in [formula] and every [formula] in L∞(B),

[formula]

This follows from where the supremum is taken on the closed unit ball of L∞(B).

By linearity, [\eqref=eq13] provides an extension of the Gelfand transform to a topological isomorphisms f  →   of [formula] onto [formula] Given [formula] take [formula] with g = . The first identity in the statement of Lemma 2 follows by approximating f∈L1(B,m) by functions in L∞(B) and the second follows from [\eqref=eq13].

Before proving part (B) of the Theorem we give an explicit example, modeled on the Meyer-Taibleson-Weiss argument, of a non-zero measure which is singular with respect to [formula] and satisfies [\eqref=eq1].

Take an open set U of [formula], U  ⊂  B0  =  {x:|x|  ≤  1}, such that U is dense in B0 and m(U)  <  m(B0). Then the compact set [formula] has positive Lebesgue measure. Set V  =  π- 1(U), so that V  ⊂   by Lemma 1. Then [formula] and so [formula], because U is dense in B0. Hence π(∂V) = E. Now, the boundary of each open set in [formula] has zero [formula] measure ([\cite=R]). Therefore (∂V) = 0 but m(π(∂V)) = m(E)  >  0. Identify C(E) to the subspace S of continuous functions on ∂V of the form [formula] f∈C(E). The bounded linear functional on S defined by [formula] extends by Hahn-Banach to a bounded linear functional on C(∂V) with the same norm. Thus there exists a positive measure μ on ∂V such that

[formula]

If B is an open ball, then by Lemma [\ref=lemma1]

[formula]

and condition [\eqref=eq1] is satisfied.

The argument is analogous to the proof of part (A), except for minor technical details. If 0 < p < 1 , then, as we will see, the singular measure μ vanishes and so we will conclude that [formula].

Let [formula] be a bounded linear functional on Fp  ,  0 < p  <  1. Let d be the integer part of [formula] Given a ball B let L∞d(B) stand for the set of functions f∈L∞(B) such that

[formula]

For each f∈L∞d(B),

[formula]

is a (p,  ∞  ) atom and so

[formula]

For each f∈L∞(B) let PB(f) be (the restriction to B of) the unique polynomial of degree not greater than d such that

[formula]

Since PB(f) is the orthogonal projection (in L2(B)) of f into the subspace of polynomials of degree not greater than d,

[formula]

where the L2 norms are taken with respect to the normalized Lebesgue measure on B. We want now to compare the norms [formula] and [formula] on the space Pd(B) of restrictions to B of polynomials of degree not greater than d. After appropriate translation and dilation we may assume that B has center 0 and radius 1. Since Pd(B) is finite dimensional, there is a constant C(d,n), depending only on d and n, such that

[formula]

and so

[formula]

Therefore by [\eqref=eq14]

[formula]

By [\eqref=eq14] there is a measure νB on B̂ such that

[formula]

Given a measure λ on B̂ there is a unique polynomial PB(λ)∈Pd(B) such that

[formula]

Hence, for every polynomial Q of degree ≤  d,

[formula]

Therefore, by [\eqref=eq16],

[formula]

for each f∈L∞(B). Hence the measure νB  -     is determined by [formula]

As before, with BN denoting the ball of radius N centered at the origin, we fix a measure ν1 on [formula] that represents [formula] on L∞d(B1) and then take the unique measure νN on [formula] which represents [formula] on L∞d(BN) and such that PB1(νN) = PB1(ν1). Then νN restricted to BN - 1 is νN - 1 and so we can define a measure ν on [formula] by requiring that ν restricted to BN be νN.

Given any ball B, take N such that B  ⊂  BN. Then the restriction of ν to L∞d(B) is [formula] and so, by [\eqref=eq15] and [\eqref=eq17], Hence

[formula]

Consider now the Radon-Nikodym decomposition of ν,

[formula]

with μ singular with respect to . We get, by [\eqref=eq18] and Lemma [\ref=lemma1],

[formula]

for each open ball B. Since 0 < p < 1, we readily conclude that μ = 0. Indeed, let r be the radius of B. Covering B by Ankn balls of radius r / k, we see that the constant C in the right-hand side of the above inequality can be replaced by [formula]. Letting k tend to ∞  , we get the conclusion.

Take now [formula] with g = . Then

[formula]

which is precisely the condition that guarantees that f determines a bounded linear functional on [formula] ([\cite=TW]). Thus [formula] is a bounded linear functional on [formula] and the proof is complete.
