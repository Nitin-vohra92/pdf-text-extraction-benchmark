Optically induced electrokinetic patterning and manipulation of particles

Introduction

The sample video is

The rich phenomenology of electrokinetically driven flows has produced extremely diverse applications of fluid flow for 'lab-on-a-chip' type of applications. Amongst these, the ability to capture, manipulate and assemble colloidal particles and biological cells is of importance for a wide range of micro-engineering applications. Here we investigate a new method of non-invasive fluid and particle manipulation technique that utilizes optically induced AC electrokinetic mechanisms. Our method utilizes near-infrared (1064 nm) light patterns generated from a holographic illumination system (Bioryx 200, Arryx Inc, Chicago, USA) coupled with a simple parallel electrode plate micro-fluidic platform with two different materials (ITO and gold) deposited on glass substrates. The simultaneous application of highly-focused light and an AC electric field will induce fluid flow towards the illuminated region and particles are subsequently accumulated on the electrode surface. The accumulated particles can be readily assembled, translated and patterned anywhere on the surface of the gold substrate. By changing the shape and intensity of the optical landscape unique geometrical colloidal assemblies can be dynamically configured. The particle group can be translated by changing the location of the optical illumination, physically moving the stage, or deactivating the initial illumination and activating a separate source at a different location. Optically induced electrohydrodynamics and electrokinetic forces are responsible for this particle manipulation technique. The focused illumination in the parallel plate electrode platform generates a unique toroidal microvortex. Due to the uniform electric field from the parallel-plate design, AC electro-osmosis (fluid motion subjected to non-uniform electric fields at low frequencies) was not observed. This microfluidic vortex shows promise to investigate electro-thermal flows decoupled from AC electro-osmosis and other electrokinetic phenomena. In this video, fluorescent polystyrene particles of 1.0 micrometers are manipulated in DI water with an illumination intensity of no more than 20 mW. The parallel electrode plates are separated by a distance of 50 micrometers. The applied electric field can be variable; the AC frequency was varied in between 10 to 50 kHz , while the applied potential was kept under 20 volts peak-to-peak.
