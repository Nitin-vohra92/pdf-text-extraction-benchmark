A puzzle

How many permutations of the first n natural numbers can we find such that any two of them place two consecutive natural numbers somewhere in the same position? This problem was introduced in [\cite=KM] where the authors conjectured that the maximum number of such permutations is exactly the middle binomial coefficient [formula] The conjecture has been neither disproved nor confirmed so far. This combinatorial puzzle is closely connected to Shannon's graph capacity concept and the rich and beautiful mathematics around it. In this paper we begin to explore its generalizations to directed graphs.

Introduction for the information theorist

In [\cite=CK] the zero-error capacity of a discrete memoryless stationary channel was generalized by restricting the input sequences to "mimick" a fixed distribution. The resulting concept of zero-error capacity within a given type allows to apply the method of types [\cite=CsK] to several important problems in extremal combinatorics and the theory of combinatorial search. All such problems can be regarded as part of zero-error information theory. In [\cite=KS] and the follow-up paper [\cite=GKV] Shannon's graph capacity problem [\cite=Sh] was generalized to directed graphs. The resulting concept of Sperner capacity and the corresponding capacity within a given type gave the key to solve an intriguing problem of Rényi in combinatorial search in [\cite=GGKV]. This direction of research started in [\cite=CKS] where the problem of zero-error capacity of the compound channel with uninformed encoder (but not decoder) was introduced as a unifying model for several problems in extremal combinatorics. Actually, in [\cite=GGKV] a formally information-theoretic analogue of this problem was solved for families of directed graphs. Much to our surprise this generalization gave Nayak and Rose [\cite=NR] the correct mathematical formulation and the technique of solution for the important problem of the zero-error capacity of the compound channel in case of uninformed encoder and decoder.

In this paper we introduce and study corresponding problems for infinite alphabet channels. Formally, our problems are concerned with Sperner-type capacity of infinite directed graphs. To the analogy of the case of capacity within a given type we restrict the input sequences to be permutations. In case of undirected graphs these problems have been introduced in [\cite=KM] and further studied in the papers [\cite=KMS] and [\cite=KSS].

Digraph-different permutations

Let [formula] denote the set of natural numbers and let G be an arbitrary directed graph with vertex set [formula]. We will say that two permutations, π and ρ of the first n natural numbers are G- different if there is an i∈[n] such that the ordered couple of its images under these two permutations satisfies (π(i),ρ(i))∈E(G). We write N(G,n) for the largest cardinality of a set of pairwise G-different permutations of

[formula]

R(G)=lim log N(G,n)

[formula]

R(G)≤ log χ(G)

[formula]

< inf R(G)

[formula]

Diverse capacities

The study of the Sperner capacity of digraphs was prompted by an interest in solving a famous problem of Rényi about the largest cardinality of a family of pairwise qualitatively independent k-partitions of an n-set. For this purpose, Simonyi and the third author initially proposed to study a concept of capacity for undirected graphs [\cite=KS] that later turned out to be reducible to the subsequent more subtle concept of Sperner capacity, [\cite=GGKV], [\cite=Cfive]. This concept seems however less tractable and more intriguing in case of the permutation capacity of infinite graphs.

It is interesting to relate this quantity to the infimum Rmin(L) of the permutation capacities of all the digraphs obtained from L. One might conjecture that, as in the case of the finite family of oriented versions of a finite simple graph, this infimum equals the robust permutation capacity of L. It is very easy to see (but we will return to this) that

[formula]

We conjecture this lower bound to be tight. If true, this conjecture, when compared to our Theorem [\ref=thm:one] below, would imply that the main theorem of [\cite=GGKV] does not generalize to infinite families of graphs.

We consider analogous problems for other digraphs on [formula] including infinite tournaments. In case the corresponding capacity is infinite, we ask more refined questions about the rate of asymptotic growth of N(G,n).

Constructions

To begin, we will study the particularly simple case of the alternating path. Consider the standard Fibonacci sequence f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2). We claim

[formula]

Proof. Let σi be the transposition (i,i + 1). Then for every set F  ⊆  [n  -  1] of natural numbers not containing consecutive elements consider the following product of transpositions

[formula]

(As all these transpositions commute, the product is well-defined.) We claim that as F runs over all the subsets of

[formula]

and let i be the smallest integer in

[formula]

(σ(i), σ(i)) ∈ E(L).

[formula]

the different permutations σF and σE define, the subsets of

[formula]

are different. This means that necessarily, for some other value j∈[n] the previous relation has to be "reversed" at least in the sense that σF(j) is even and σE(j) is odd. On the other hand, since both of our permutations have the property that

[formula]

for every i∈[n], we see that

[formula]

Since we know that the two images of j have different parity, we must conclude that

[formula]

and thus

[formula]

This concludes the proof that our permutations differ in the required way under the hypothesis that the first position in which E and F differ is odd. Clearly, if that position is even, the same proof can be applied exchanging odd and even in the above.

Finally, note that the number of loose subsets of

[formula]

N(L,n)≥

[formula]

R(L)≥ log

[formula]

we will consider the permutation σF defined there. To each of these permutations we will associate the couple of values of two functionals we define next.

Let [formula] be an arbitrary loose subset of

[formula]

λ(F):=|F|     μ(F):=i.

[formula]

generated by the full inverse images of the various values of the last functional. By the foregoing, this partition has at most n3 different classes. Hence there exists at least one class C whose cardinality gives

[formula]

Note that every set F∈C has the same cardinality. Let k be this common cardinality.

We claim that the permutations associated by our construction to the member sets of C are pairwise Lc-different. In order to see this, let us consider two different sets, E and F from C and write

[formula]

Let j be the first index for which [formula] Without loss of generality we can suppose that ej < fj. This means for the corresponding permutations that σE(ej) = ej + 1 while σF(ej) = ej, whence

[formula]

Now, by our construction

[formula]

This implies that there is an index i for which ei > fi. Let ł denote the first such index. It is easy to see that we have σF(fi) = fi + 1, while at the same time σE(fi) = fi. The latter is implied by the fact that [formula] (since F is loose) and thus [formula] This gives

[formula]

[formula]

To conclude this section, we will concentrate on the robust permutation capacity of L.

For the infinite path L we have

[formula]

implying

[formula]

Proof.

Let F run through the subsets of the odd elements of . Clearly [formula] On the other hand, consider any two sets from F. Let these be E and F and let j be the first element contained in only one of them, say j∈E - F. Then, as before, we have for the corresponding permutations

[formula]

[formula]

It seems very interesting to establish whether this lower bound is tight, especially in the light of our main result, concerning the infimum of the permutation capacities of the digraphs from L.

[formula]

Proof.

We define the digraph B = {V(G),E(G)} as follows. The vertices of B are V(B): = {a,b,c} and the edges are E(B): = {(a,c),(c,a),(b,c),(c,b),(a,b)}. In other words, B is obtained from the symmmetric clique on 3 vertices by omitting a single edge. We denote by ωs(Bn) the cardinality of the largest symmetric clique in the n'th conormal power of Bn. It is well-known and easily seen (cf. [\cite=GKV]) that

[formula]

for every [formula]

Let us now take a closer look at an arbitrary but fixed digraph G∈L. For this purpose, we consider, for every [formula] another digraph, Gn, whose vertex set is the set of permutations of

N(G,n)=ω(G).

Tournaments

We would like to comment briefly on the apparently much simpler case of the family of all oriented versions of the infinite complete graph K with vertex set [formula] Let us indeed look at the family K of all the oriented graphs resulting from the different orientations of the edges of K. In this case it is obvious that N(F,n) takes its maximum value in K on the digraph F∈K only in case the digraph induced by F on
