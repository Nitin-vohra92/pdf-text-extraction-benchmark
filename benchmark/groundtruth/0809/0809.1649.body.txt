The Sensitivity of SNO+ to Δm212 Using Reactor Anti-neutrino Data

Introduction

The SNO+ detector is a 1-kton liquid scintillator detector that can detect reactor anti-neutrinos via inverse beta decay. The performance of SNO+ in the detection of these anti-neutrinos is basically identical to that of KamLAND: the target masses are almost identical, the detection efficiency and detector live time fraction are almost the same, and the background noise levels are similar. The main difference between the two experiments is the distribution of the sources of anti-neutrinos (Fig. [\ref=fig:reactor_distribution]). Kamioka is surrounded by two reactor sites less than 100 km away and nine within 300 km, with a flux-weighted average of about 180 km; in contrast, SNO+ has no reactor sites within a distance of 100 km, and just one within 300 km, with a corresponding flux-weighted average distance of ≈   750 km. As a result of these differences, the reactor anti-neutrino flux at SNO+ is about 1/5 of that at KamLAND.

In spite of the lower flux at SNO+, its sensitivity to the neutrino oscillation parameter Δm212 for a given exposure (say, in units of 1032 proton-years) is almost the same as for KamLAND. The statistical disadvantage of SNO+ is compensated by the more distinct oscillatory signature of the anti-neutrino energy spectrum. In general, for a nearly background-free measurement above Eν  =  3.4 MeV (this energy cut is applied to avoid geo-neutrinos, accidentals, and the 13C(α,n)16O background), the sensitivity to Δm212 depends on the total number of detected events N and a factor K that depends on the rate of change of the shape of the distortion in the energy spectrum as a function of Δm212. The fractional uncertainty of Δm212 is proportional to the following:

[formula]

The statistical disadvantage of SNO+ compared to KamLAND is expressed as [formula]. The purpose of this document is to show that KKamLAND / KSNO + has approximately the same value, so that the sensitivity of these two experiments to Δm212 is almost the same.

Basic Information Used in This Study

The latest result from KamLAND [\cite=kamland] is used as a baseline for the comparison with SNO+. Specifically, the exposure is chosen to be 2.44  ×  1032 proton-years, and the best-fit solar neutrino oscillation parameter values was chosen as:

[formula]

The mixing angle expressed in terms of [formula] is:

[formula]

These values are not exactly the same as given in [\cite=kamland], but they are well within the uncertainties.

The choice of uncertainty to use is not unique, since several different analyses are presented in [\cite=kamland]. Since the aim of this study is to compare the statistical power of SNO+ with that of KamLAND, the errors for the analysis using only the KamLAND data are used (in preference to that from the global analysis of data from KamLAND and all solar neutrino experiments). Combining the statistical and systematic errors in quadrature, the 1σ uncertainty on the oscillation parameters are as follows:

[formula]

[formula]

The 1σ range of [formula] based on the above is [formula]. These ranges were used as a guide in determining the parameter range to examine in this study.

The location and power of nuclear reactors was obtained using the information provided by the International Nuclear Safety Center (INSC) of the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) [\cite=insc]. The information was obtained in 2006; for details about the list used in this study, see Appendix [\ref=app:reactors]. It is less accurate than information provided by the reactor operators, such as that used by the KamLAND collaboration. In particular, absolute normalization of the anti-neutrino flux is rather inaccurate because the rated power is often different from the power during operation, and because the INSC list has no information about the duty cycle. In this study, we used a constant factor of 0.8 to represent the average duty cycle for all reactors (i.e. the power of all reactors was scaled down by this factor).

The anti-neutrino detection rate depends not only on the flux, but on the detection efficiency. This was tuned in our model so that the number of anti-neutrino events from our model matches that from KamLAND. Although KamLAND's detection efficiency is energy dependent, we ignored this dependence. As discussed below, a detection efficiency of 95% for Eν  >  3.4 MeV was found to give a good match between the model and KamLAND.

The above inaccuracy of the nuclear reactor model also affects the predicted shape of the anti-neutrino spectrum after oscillations, but to a lesser extent that the overall normalization of the flux. Below, we shall show that the spectrum shape from our model is quite similar to that from KamLAND. Since the goal of this study is to compare the sensitivity of the two experiments to Δm212, the approximation should be adequate as long as the basic features in the spectrum shape are reproduced.

Tuning the Nuclear Reactor Model to KamLAND Data

According to the latest KamLAND result [\cite=kamland], the expected number of events with Eν  >  1.8 MeV passing all selection cuts before oscillations is 2179. In comparison, the reactor model used here predicts 3345 events, assuming 100% duty cycle and detection efficiency. Taking the duty cycle to be 80%, this becomes 2676 events. Taking the ratio of 2179 to 2676, one has a tuned detection efficiency for Eν  >  1.8 MeV of 0.81. This is a reasonable value in view of KamLAND's detection efficiency shown in the top frame of Fig. [\ref=fig:kamland_nuebar_spec].

In the study presented here, we shall focus on the essentially background-free region of Eν  >  3.4 MeV, where KamLAND's detection efficiency is mostly well above 90%. In order to tune our model, we shall use as a standard the number of events after oscillations in the bin [formula] MeV ([formula]) MeV, which is about 160. Fig. [\ref=fig:reactor_neutrino_spec_kl] shows the model spectrum where the number of events after oscillations in the reference bin was tuned to be approximately the same as for KamLAND. The detection efficiency in the model after tuning was 95%. The agreement between the model and KamLAND spectra is reasonable. There is some disagreement around Eν  =  3.4 MeV because the energy dependence of the detection efficiency has been ignored in the model. But this level of disagreement should not significantly affect conclusions regarding the relative sensitivity to Δm212 in KamLAND and SNO+.

The Shape of the Reactor Anti-neutrino Spectrum

The sensitivity of a given experiment to the neutrino oscillation parameters depends on how quickly the event rate and the spectrum shape change as a function of the parameter values. This is illustrated for KamLAND and SNO+ in Figs. [\ref=fig:reactor_neutrino_spec_diff_par_vals_v2_kl] and [\ref=fig:reactor_neutrino_spec_diff_par_vals_v2_sno+]. There are a few notable features about the two figures.

The event statistics in KamLAND is about 5 times as large as that in SNO+.

In KamLAND, when Δm2 is changed by 1σ, the histogram contents in many bins changes by somewhat less than 1σ. The same holds when sin 22θ is changed by 1σ.

In SNO+, when Δm2 is changed by 1σ, the relative change in shape of the spectrum in many bins is much larger than is the case for KamLAND. On the other hand, the change in the spectrum with a 1σ change in sin 22θ is much smaller than in KamLAND.

The above indicate that, because the event rate is much smaller in SNO+ than in KamLAND, SNO+ is much less sensitive to the mixing angle. However, because the rate of change of spectrum shape as a function of Δm2 in SNO+ is much larger than in KamLAND, SNO+, for a given number of events, is more sensitive to Δm2. Of course, this superiority in sensitivity is, to some extent, canceled out by the fact that the event rate in SNO+ is only 1/5 that in KamLAND.

The advantage that SNO+ has over KamLAND in its sensitivity to Δm2 can be expressed quantitatively using a quantity K, which is related to the fractional error in Δm2 as follows:

[formula]

where N is the number of observed events, K is a constant that depends on how quickly the shape of the anti-neutrino energy spectrum changes as a function of Δm2, and α is a constant that is the same for any experiment (it depends on how the likelihood function is defined). The quantity K is given by the following expression:

[formula]

In the above integral, the function f(Eν;Δm2) is the reactor antineutrino energy spectrum for Δm2 (the mixing angle is assumed to be fixed such that sin 22θ  =  0.928). It is normalized so that the integral is equal to unity:

[formula]

The integral for 1 / K2 has a form resembling χ2, which is not an accident because it is extracted from a log-likelihood function for the fit parameter Δm2. In applying this formula, one takes the red or blue function in Fig. [\ref=fig:k_fac_plots_kl] or [\ref=fig:k_fac_plots_sno+] and the black function and calculate the difference squared. This is divided by the contents of the black function. The result is the integrand, which is integrated over the energy range of the fit. The more different the two functions, the larger the integral, which implies that K is smaller. Since K is proportional to the parameter uncertainty, one can conclude that the greater the difference in shape for a unit change in parameter value, the smaller the parameter error.

The value of K for KamLAND and SNO+ is shown in Table [\ref=tab:k_factors]. The quantity K- is the K-factor for the case where the function at the central value of Δm2 is compared to that at - 1σ, while K+ is that for + 1σ. The final row in the table shows the ratio of the factors, KamLAND to SNO+. The factor at KamLAND is about 2.6 to 2.8 times larger than at SNO+. This is a quantitative measure of how much more power SNO+ has compared to KamLAND in extracting Δm2 due to the rate of change of the shape as a function of Δm2. Specifically, the ratio of the fractional error of Δm2 between KamLAND and SNO+ is (from Eqn. [\ref=eqn:delta_dmsq_over_dmsq]):

[formula]

This is a remarkable result: although KamLAND has five times the statistics as SNO+, the latter's sensitivity to Δm2 is 20~  30% better because of the advantage in the shape of the spectrum, as indicated by the K-factors. The argument based on the K-factor is an approximation, but the conclusion is supported by a rigorous determination of the parameter sensitivity, which is discussed in the next section.

The Sensitivity of the Experiments to Δm212

The sensitivity of the experiments to Δm212 was established rigorously by performing an ensemble experiment on randomly generated data. The random data were generated using the central value of the neutrino oscillation parameters: [formula]. This was compared to the predicted spectrum at some other parameter pair using the following log-likelihood function:

[formula]

The likelihood function was evaluated in the anti-neutrino energy range [formula] MeV with 33 bins (bin width = 0.2 MeV). Energy below 3.4 MeV was excluded to avoid irreducible background noise, which significantly diminishes the importance of the contribution of this energy region to the extraction of the oscillation parameters. The quantity μi is the number of events expected for the current grid point in the oscillation parameter space, while ni is the randomly generated number of events for the central parameter pair. The gamma function is just a convenient way to evaluate ni!. A total of 400 points in the parameter space was examined (Fig. [\ref=fig:osc_par_grid]). At each grid point, data were generated randomly 1000 times and the log-likelihood function evaluated. The average and RMS of the evaluations was taken to represent the log-likelihood value and uncertainty at that point.

The result for KamLAND is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:osc_pars_marginalized_kl], which is the marginalized log-likelihood (times 2) as a function of the oscillation parameters. The 1σ errors from the ensemble experiment is obtained by determining the distance from the minimum to the point where 2ΔL  =  1; KamLAND's ±  1σ statistical errors are indicated by the vertical dashed blue lines. The errors agree fairly well. The 1σ error for Δm212 for KamLAND according to the ensemble experiment is:

[formula]

Fig. [\ref=fig:osc_pars_marginalized_sno+] shows the marginalized likelihood as a function of the oscillation parameters for SNO+. As expected, SNO+ constrains the mixing angle much less because the statistics is much smaller, but the curvature of the likelihood as a function of Δm212 is almost the same as for KamLAND. The 1σ limit for SNO+ is:

[formula]

In Eqn. [\ref=eqn:k_factor_eval], the analysis based on the K-factor predicted that SNO+ would have Δm2 sensitivity that is 20~  30% better than in KamLAND in spite of having only 1/5 the statistics. Here, we find from Eqns. [\ref=eqn:dmsq_kl] and [\ref=eqn:dmsq_snoplus] based on a rigorous likelihood analysis that the relative sensitivity is about the same (lower error) or about 20% better (upper error).

Conclusion

Insofar as reactor anti-neutrino detection is concerned, the SNO+ detector is expected to perform similarly to KamLAND. The main difference between the two is the distribution of nuclear reactors, which provide the detectors with anti-neutrinos. KamLAND has a greater number of reactors within 300 km compared to SNO+, resulting in a flux that is about 5 times greater. This gives KamLAND a natural statistical advantage of [formula] in determining the neutrino oscillation parameters for a given exposure to reactor anti-neutrinos. SNO+, however, has an advantage based on the fact that relatively few reactors contribute to the bulk of detected events, and the few reactors that contribute to the bulk have baseline distances such that the oscillatory signature interfere constructively, resulting in the anti-neutrino spectrum shape varying rapidly as a function of Δm212. The advantage could be made quantitative in an approximate manner using the so-called K-factor technique. This factor quantifies the degree of similarity of the shape of a function at two different parameter values: the more similar they are (i.e. the slower the shape changes with parameter value), the larger K is. Thus an experiment with a small K is more sensitive to the parameter of interest compared to that with large K. It was found that K for SNO+ was 2.6~  2.8 times smaller than in KamLAND, which more than compensates for the statistical disadvantage factor at SNO+ of 2.2. Combining the effect of statistics and the shape, SNO+ is expected to outperform KamLAND in determining Δm2 by about 20~  30%. A more careful likelihood-based analysis confirmed this result: the sensitivity of SNO+ to Δm212 was about the same or better by 20% compared to that of KamLAND.

The Position and Thermal Power of Nuclear Reactors

A list of nuclear reactor information was compiled based on information provided by the International Nuclear Safety Center (INSC) of the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) [\cite=insc]. As of 2006, there were 607 nuclear reactors in the list, although only a 478 of them were reported as operational. The total rated thermal power of the reactors is 1.3 TW, while the total of the 478 operational ones is 1.1 TW. A table summarizing this information is available at the following web site:

http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~  guillian/SNO+/reactor/2007-05-05/ reactor_list/Table.html

The power flux from these nuclear reactors is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:power_flux]. The power flux at a given location on Earth is given by:

[formula]

where Pi is the power of reactor number i, and Di is the distance between this reactor and the given point on Earth.

More information is available at the following web site:

http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~  guillian/SNO+/reactor/2007-05-05/ index.html

In particular, the list of reactors is available in text file format in the following sites:

http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~  guillian/SNO+/reactor/2007-05-05/ reactor_list/reactor_list_2006-11-14.txt

http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~  guillian/SNO+/reactor/2007-05-05/ reactor_list/reactor_list_2006-11-14_consolidated.txt

The first list gives the thermal power, operational status, and latitude and longitude of each reactor, while the latter gives information about only operational reactors. Also note that the first one is a reactor-by-reactor list, while the latter is a site-by-site list, meaning that in sites with several reactors, the powers were combined. When combining the powers, only operational powers were considered. The total number of reactor sites is 208, whereas the total number of reactors is 607.
