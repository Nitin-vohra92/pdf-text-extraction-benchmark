Finite number of Kaluza-Klein modes, all with zero masses

The use of extra dimension(s) is a popular tool in high energy physics [\cite=Kaluza] [\cite=Klein] [\cite=Duff] [\cite=ED1] [\cite=Antoniadis0] [\cite=ED2] [\cite=RS1] [\cite=RS2] [\cite=Uehara] [\cite=Flacke] because it gives a more tidy picture of nature, that ranges from geometrization of all forces of nature in the spirit of general relativity to a better understanding of the cosmological constant problem, hierarchy problem, fermion generations, Yukawa couplings and flavor etc.. The world we live in is apparently 4-dimensional. Hence extra dimensions (if exist) must be hidden at present (relatively low) energies. The standard way to ensure this is to take the extra dimension(s) be compact and tiny (e.g. a tiny circle). Then, by Fourier theorem, a field in the whole space can be expanded in a tower of particles that are identical except their masses and their profile in the extra dimension(s). Such a tower of a particle (or field) is called a Kaluza-Klein (KK) tower of that particle (or field), and it is an infinite series except in some exceptional cases that need complicated boundary conditions to be satisfied [\cite=Grard-Nuyts1] [\cite=Grard-Nuyts2] [\cite=Grard-Nuyts3] [\cite=Grard-Nuyts4]. Depending on the boundary conditions the KK tower may contain a zero mode (i.e. a mode that does not depend on the extra dimension(s)) or not. A zero mode does not acquire a mass from the extra dimensional piece of the kinetic part of the Lagrangian while all other modes gain masses of order of [formula] where L is the size of the extra dimension. Phenomenological considerations require the masses of the higher KK modes be at least in TeV scale, and usually in the order of Planck mass for standard model particles [\cite=Antoniadis]. So KK modes except the zero mode can not be identified with the usual particles. Therefore a scheme where the number of KK modes is finite and all gain zero masses from the kinetic part of the Lagrangian would be highly desirable. I this study I present a toy model for fermions where the number of observed KK modes is finite at current energies, and all modes are massless as long as the kinetic part of the Lagrangian is considered.

In the vein of a framework proposed for cosmological constant problem [\cite=Erdem1] [\cite=Erdem2] [\cite=Erdem3] [\cite=Erdem4] I consider the following 5-dimensional metric

[formula]

where the symbol x with no indices stands for the 4-dimensional coordinates xμ̄. I take the extra dimension be compact and its size be L, and [formula]. Although this metric has singularity at [formula] this singularity does not survive after integration over the extra dimension z (i.e. at the scales larger than the size of the extra dimension). Moreover the location of the singularity at the sharp value, [formula] suggests that this singularity may be removed by the metric fluctuations in quantum gravity [\cite=Guendelman]. So given the toy model nature of this study I will not dwell on this technical point further for the sake of a relatively simple framework to study.

I take [formula]diag(1, - 1, - 1, - 1, - 1) (i.e. gμ̄    =    ημ̄) to have a simple model where one can focus on the essential points of the model. The action for (free) fermionic fields for this space is

[formula]

where H.C. stands for Hermitian conjugate, and the second term is spin connection term (See Appendix A). The small Latin indices a, b, etc. refer to the tangent space while the capital Latin indices A,B, etc. refer to the space defined by ([\ref=a1]). The tangent space in this case coincides with [formula] =[formula]. So the indices with a bar on it also refer to the tangent space in this paper. The action is required to be invariant under the 5-dimensional space-time reflections, namely,

[formula]

where all coordinates are space-time reflected simultaneously.

χ may be Fourier decomposed in the extra dimension as

[formula]

(where the absolute value signs in |n| is used to emphasize the positiveness of n in those terms, and half-fractional values in the sum correspond to anti-periodic boundary conditions). The form of [formula] is determined by the requirement of covariance under (the spinor representation of) [formula] and is given by

[formula]

where [formula]'s are the gamma matrices of ([\ref=a1]). However we take [formula] simply be [formula] for the sake of simplicity and it does not essentially change the result as we shall mention when we discuss the masses of the KK modes. Let us return to the main subject after this remark. I take [formula] to transform under ([\ref=a3]) as

[formula]

where the upper indices A and S are suppressed, and CPT denotes the usual 4-dimensional CPT operator (acting on the spinor part of the field). Only the positions of fields (i.e. xa's) are multiplied by - 1 while the orientation of the fields in the space-time remain essentially the same i.e. the spinor part of χ remains essentially the same. In this respect ([\ref=a3]) is the analog of CPT transformation rather than PT transformation in 4-dimensions. The invariance of ([\ref=a2]) under ([\ref=a3]) requires iγa∂aχ in Lf be invariant under ([\ref=a3]). iγμ∂μχ is invariant under 4-dimensional CPT. These together imply that iγμ∂μχ (i.e. iγμχ) is even under the extra dimensional part of ([\ref=a3]). So the possible form of Lf (after requiring it be odd under ([\ref=a3])) is

[formula]

In other words ([\ref=a3]) requires Lf be either of the terms in ([\ref=a5]) or their linear combination.

Further the invariance of the action under an extra dimensional reflection similar to the one given in [\cite=Erdem1] [\cite=Erdem2]

[formula]

is imposed. Under ([\ref=a6]) the volume element in ([\ref=a2]) transforms as

[formula]

Then invariance of ([\ref=a2]) under ([\ref=a6]) requires iγa∂aχ be even under the same transformation. I impose χ satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions [\cite=conformal] i.e. [formula]. This sets n in ([\ref=a4a],[\ref=a4b]) be odd. Then, the invariance of action (including the quantum paths) under ([\ref=a3]), ([\ref=a6a]) and ([\ref=a6]) requires the 4-dimensional part of Sf be (see Appendix B)

[formula]

where 2r + 1 = 4l + 1, 2s + 1 = 4p + 3 (l,p=0,1,2,....) or vice versa. Because of the periodicity of cosine function the terms in ([\ref=a8]) give non-zero contributions after integration over z only if the arguments of cosines are zero. This is possible only when

[formula]

The result of z integration in ([\ref=a8]) is

[formula]

The diagonalization of ([\ref=a11]) results in

[formula]

Hence there are one usual fermion and one ghost fermion in the spectrum.

The iγ4∂4χ part of Lf reduces to [formula] type of terms as a result of the action of the derivative operator ∂4 in ([\ref=a2]) (see Appendix A, part 2). This, in turn, results in odd number of sine terms (in the action) that leads to zero after integration over z. The number of modes that survive after integration may be increased by changing the extra dimension dependent conformal factor and/or the dimension of the space. For example if the conformal factor in ([\ref=a1]) is changed to cos 2kz then the condition ([\ref=a10]) is changed into r + s - 3 = 0. The kinetic term induces no mass term in this case as well because the extra dimensional derivatives induce odd number of sine terms in this case as well. The same second term in ([\ref=a2]), that is, the spin connection term also induce no mass term because it contains odd number of sine terms as well (see Appendix A, part 1). A similar conclusion should be expected for more complicated conformal terms or higher dimensional spaces. In other words no mass is induced for Kaluza-Klein modes through the extra dimensional part of the kinetic term in this model, and similar results are expected for more complicated situations with similar conformal terms and symmetries. Here I have taken χn's be simply given by the first terms in ([\ref=a4c]). However taking the general form does not change the conclusion because vanishing of the extra dimensional kinetic term after integration follows directly from the extra dimensional coordinates rather than the extra dimensional form of the spinor.

I have introduced an extra dimensional model where only two modes of Kaluza-Klein tower appear at low energies. These modes correspond to a fermion and a ghost fermion. These fermions are massless provided we do not introduce a bulk mass term explicitly. The ghost fermion may be identified by a Lee-Wick [\cite=Lee] or Pauli-Villars [\cite=Pauli-Villars] type regularization field. These results are quite non-standard both in the emergence of a finite number of Kaluza-Klein modes and the modes higher than zero mode gaining no masses through the extra dimensional piece of kinetic term at low energies where the extra dimensions become directly unobservable. In fact this is also the basic tool to distinguish this scheme from the usual Kaluza-Klein prescription. If nature behaves in the way described here then all Kaluza-Klein modes of a fermion will be observed at short distances smaller than the size of the corresponding extra dimension while only a finite number of these modes will be detected at larger scales after they are produced (even when they are stable or long living so that they can travel large distances before decay). Moreover the coupling of fermions to other particles would vary nonlinearly with distance at the scales smaller than the size of the extra dimension since the screening effect of the conformal factor cos kz changes nonlinearly at distances below the size of the extra dimension. This would be another characteristic of this type of models. In fact one may easily find different metrics of different form and in different dimensions with finite number of Kaluza-Klein modes (obtained after integration over extra dimensions) and all with zero masses. The aim of this study is to show the possibility of obtaining finite number of Kaluza-Klein modes at low energies, and the possibility of massless Kaluza-Klein modes higher than zero mode. So a relatively simple model where these properties can be observed is studied here rather than a detailed model that is in agreement with phenomenology. I hope different variations of such models with more realistic spectra may be found in future.

Possible Contributions to Masses Due to The Spin Connection and the Extra Dimensional Part of the Kinetic Term

Contribution Due to Spin Connection

The vielbeins, eaB, corresponding to the metric, gBC in ([\ref=a1]) , and those corresponding to its inverse gBC are determined from

[formula]

where the lower indices a, b stand for the tangent space of the original space (e.g. the one defined by ([\ref=a1])). The vielbeins corresponding to the metric in ([\ref=a1]) are found to be

[formula]

where δaB, δBa are the Kronecker delta, and [formula]=(1, - 1, - 1, - 1, - 1). In curved spaces the derivative term ∂B when acting on spinors is replaced by DB [\cite=Weinberg]

[formula]

Here γb(c) are the (flat) tangent space Dirac gamma matrices that are related to the gamma matrices of the original space ΓB by

[formula]

where the bars over the integers are used to emphasize that they belong to the tangent space, and ωbcB's are the spin connections, that are given by

[formula]

where ΓFPB=[formula] denotes Christoffel symbols, and the commas denote the usual derivative with respect to that coordinate. The non-vanishing ΓFPB's in the space defined by Eq.([\ref=a1]) are

[formula]

So the spin connection that gives a non-zero contribution is found to be

[formula]

The ωbc4 element of spin connection is found to be zero. Then

[formula]

where the upper case indices B,C,F etc. denote the space-time coordinates while the lower case indices a,b,c etc. and the indices with a bar over e.g. [formula], [formula] etc. denote the tangent space. Although there is a bar over 4 in ([\ref=apb7]) that bar is omitted in ([\ref=a2]) to simplify the notation. Therefore the result may be written a more compact form as in Eq.([\ref=a2]) where ωab4 gives null contribution.

After using Eqs. ([\ref=apb7]) and ([\ref=apb8] one obtains Eq.([\ref=a2]). It is evident from ([\ref=a2]) and Eq.([\ref=apb6]) that the integration of the spin connection term eμaγaωbcμJbc over the extra dimension z is proportional to

[formula]

In other words the spin connection term dose not contribute to the masses of ψ, ψ̃ of Eq.([\ref=a12a]) at (relatively low energies) where the extra dimension can not be seen.

Contribution Due to the Extra Dimensional Part of the Kinetic Term

The extra dimensional part of the kinetic term for the action of the field χ is

[formula]

where the H.C. symbol (in Eq.([\ref=a8])) for the addition the Hermitian conjugate of ([\ref=apa4]) to itself is suppressed. So the extra dimensional piece of the kinetic term in this paper does not contribute to the masses of ψ or ψ̃ at length scales larger than the size of the extra dimension.

Derivation of Eq.([\ref=a8])

It is observed that

[formula]

The requirement that the action ([\ref=a2]) be invariant under ([\ref=a6a])requires n = 4l + 1 type of modes couple to m = 4p + 3 type of modes. In the light of this observation the combination that is invariant under ([\ref=a6]) is

[formula]

where

[formula]

So the 4-dimensional part of Sf becomes

[formula]

where the H.C. symbol (as in Eq.([\ref=apb10])) is suppressed. ([\ref=apa4]) after use of ([\ref=apa2]) results in ([\ref=a8]). It is evident from ([\ref=a8]) that the resulting Lagrangian has the form required by ([\ref=a5]) as well.
