Separability of Tripartite Quantum Systems

Ming Li1, Shao-Ming Fei1,2 and Zhi-Xi Wang1

Quantum entanglement has been recently recognized as the most essential ingredient in the quantum information technology. One of the important problems in the theory of quantum entanglement is the separability. A multipartite state is called fully separable if and only if the density matrix [formula] can be written as:

[formula]

where [formula] are density matrices associated with the subsystems [formula], and 0 < pi  ≤  1, [formula].

Many separability criteria have been found in recent years. For pure states, the problem is completely solved, e.g., by using the Schmidt decomposition [formula]. For mixed states, there are separability criteria such as PPT, reduction, majorization, realignment etc. [formula]. In [formula] the authors have given a lower bound of concurrence for tripartite quantum states which can be used to detect entanglement. In [formula] the authors have provided a numerically computable criterion which can detect PPT entangled states for three qubits systems. The efficient criteron is then generalized to tripartite systems with arbitrary dimensions [formula]. In [formula] some nice results shew that some quantity related to Hermitian matrix is positive for quantum mixed states in 2  ×  N systems, which was further discussed in [formula]. These results were generalized to arbitrary dimensional bipartite systems (or 2  ×  2  ×  N quantum systems) in [formula]. In this paper, we study arbitrary tripartite systems in analogue to the approach used in [formula]. The properties of tripartite density matrices are studied in terms of the Bloch representations. A necessary condition for the separability of tripartite states has been obtained. These results are non-trivial when they are reduced to bipartite systems discussed in [formula] and the separability criterion do detect some entanglements.

Any Hermitian operator on an N-dimensional Hilbert space HN can be expressed according to the generators of the special unitary group SU(N) [\cite=Hioe]. The generators of SU(N) can be introduced according to the transition-projection operators

[formula]

where |i〉, i = 1,...,N, are the orthonormal eigenstates of a linear Hermitian operator on HN. Set

[formula]

where 1  ≤  l  ≤  N - 1 and 1  ≤  j  <  k  ≤  N. We get a set of N2 - 1 operators

[formula]

which satisfy the relations

[formula]

and thus generate the SU(N) [formula].

Any Hermitian operator ρ in HN can be represented in terms of these generators of SU(N),

[formula]

where IN is a unit matrix and [formula]. [formula] is called Bloch vector. The set of all the Bloch vectors that constitute a density operator is known as the Bloch vector space [formula].

A matrix of the form (1) is of unit trace and Hermitian, but it might not be positive. To guarantee the positivity restrictions must be imposed on the Bloch vector. It is shown that [formula] is a subset of the ball [formula] of radius [formula], which is the minimum ball containing it, and that the ball [formula] of radius [formula] is included in [formula] [\cite=Harriman], that is,

[formula]

Let the dimensions of systems A, B and C be N1,N2 and N3 respectively. Any tripartite quantum states [formula] can be written as:

[formula]

where λi(1), λj(2) are the generators of SU(N1) and SU(N2); [formula] and Mij are operators of HN3.

Let [formula], [formula] and [formula], [formula]. For a tripartite quantum state [formula] with representation ([\ref=2]), we have

[formula]

Since [formula], [formula] and [formula], [formula], we have that [formula] and [formula] are positive Hermitian operators. Let [formula]. Then AρA  ≥  0 and (AρA)† = AρA. The partial trace of AρA over HN1 (and HN2) should be also positive. Hence

[formula]

[formula]

Formula ([\ref=t1]) is valid for any tripartite states. By setting [formula] in ([\ref=t1]), one can get a result for bipartite systems:

Let [formula] which can be generally written as [formula], then for any [formula] with [formula], [formula].

In [\cite=Zhao], a separability criterion for N1  ×  N2 systems has been obtained: if ρAB is separable, then [formula] is positive for any vector [formula] with [formula]. Noticing that [formula] for any N1  ≥  2, we get from our corollary that this criterion can not recognize any bipartite entangled states, as it is true for both entangled and separable states.

A separable state ρABC can be written as

[formula]

From ([\ref=1]) it can also be represented as:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are real vectors on the Bloch sphere satisfying [formula] and [formula].

Comparing (2) with (4), we have

[formula]

For any (N21 - 1)  ×  (N21 - 1) real matrix R(1) and (N22 - 1)  ×  (N22 - 1) real matrix R(2) satisfying [formula] and [formula], we define a new matrix

[formula]

where T is a transformation acting on an (N21 - 1)  ×  (N22 - 1) matrix M by

[formula]

Using R we define a new operator γR,

[formula]

where [formula] and M'ij = (T(M))ij = (R(1)MRT(2))ij.

If ρABC is separable, then γR(ρABC)  ≥  0.

From (5) and (7) we get

[formula]

A straightforward calculation gives rise to

[formula]

As [formula] and [formula], we get

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore γR(ρABC) is still a density operator, i.e. γR(ρABC)  ≥  0.[formula]

Theorem 2 gives a necessary separability criterion for general tripartite systems. The result can be also applied to bipartite systems. Let [formula], [formula]. For any real (N21 - 1)  ×  (N21 - 1) matrix R satisfying [formula] and any state ρAB, we define

[formula]

where [formula].

For [formula], if there exists an R with [formula] such that γR(ρAB) < 0, then ρAB must be entangled.

For 2  ×  N systems, our corollary is reduced to the results in [\cite=S.J.Wu]. Generally this criterion do detect certain entanglement of [formula] systems. As an example we consider the 3  ×  3 Istropic states,

[formula]

If we choose R to be [formula], we get when 0.5 < p  ≤  1, ρI is entangled. For tripartite case, we take the following [formula] mixed state as an example:

[formula]

where [formula]. Taking [formula], we have that ρ is entangled for [formula].

In fact the criterion for 2  ×  N systems [\cite=S.J.Wu] is equivalent to the PPT criterion [\cite=Rudolph]. Our theorem 2 is also equivalent to the PPT criterion for 2  ×  2  ×  N systems. This can be seen from the followings. Let us choose [formula] and R(2) = I3. A separable state [formula] can be represented as:

[formula]

By the definition we get

[formula]

For ρTBABC and ρTABABC, we can similarly choose

[formula]

If γR(ρABC)  ≥  0, we get that ρTA,ρTB and ρTAB are also positive operators.

On the other hand, if there is an entangled PPT state [formula], ρTAABC  ≥  0, ρTBABC  ≥  0 and ρTABABC  ≥  0, but γR(ρABC) < 0 for some real 3  ×  3 matrices R(1) and R(2) such that RT(1)R(1)  ≤  I and RT(2)R(2)  ≤  I, with R being defined in ([\ref=5]). Then one can define, for all [formula], [formula] with [formula], and [formula]. Obviously ΛR(1) would map the Bloch sphere to itself. Hence ΛR(1) is a positive map. From [\cite=S.L._Woronowicz] it follows that ΛR(1) can be expressed as [formula], where ΛCPR(1)(1) and ΛCPR(1)(2) denote completely positive maps, and T the transpose. Similar result can be obtained for ΛR(2). A straightforward calculation shows that

[formula]

Since that the tensor product of two completely positive maps is still a completely positive map and ρTAABC  ≥  0, ρTBABC  ≥  0 and ρTABABC  ≥  0, this implies that γR(ρABC)  ≥  0. This is a contradiction. Hence the theorem 2 is equivalent to the PPT criterion for 2  ×  2  ×  N systems.

We have studied the separability of tripartite quantum systems. In terms of the Bloch representation of density matrices, a necessary condition for the separability of tripartite states has been obtained. Our approach gives a new way of separability investigation. For [formula] systems our criterion is equivalent to PPT, namely PPT criterion can be also understood according to the Bloch representation approach. Nevertheless it is rather complicated to compare our criterion with PPT generally for higher dimensional tripartite systems. Moreover as the PPT and realignment separability criteria can give rise to lower bonds of entanglement of formation and concurrence [\cite=Chen-Albeverio-Fei], one could also discuss the possible relations between the lower bounds of entanglement and the separability criterion in this letter. The approach can be also generalized to arbitrary multipartite systems.
