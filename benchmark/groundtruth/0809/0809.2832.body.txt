Fermi Surface Evolution Across Multiple Charge Density Wave Transitions in ErTe3

Charge density wave systems have been studied for many decades [\cite=gruner_94]. CDWs and spin density waves, the spin analog, exist in all dimensions. However, enhanced electron interactions in systems with reduced dimensionality increases the susceptibility for CDW formation, also known as a Peierls distortion in one dimension [\cite=grioni_jes99] [\cite=dardel_prl91] [\cite=perfetti_prb02] [\cite=fawcett_rmp88] [\cite=schafer_prl03] [\cite=gweon_prl98] [\cite=brouet_prl04]. In ideal 1D systems the FS topology determines the susceptibility for CDW formation via electron-phonon coupling [\cite=gruner_94]. If the FS can be nested with one q-vector of a particular phonon mode, the ground state energy can be reduced by electron-phonon coupling resulting in gaps opening at the Fermi level. Real systems are never perfectly 1D, resulting in imperfect FS nesting with a partially gapped FS and residual metallic pockets [\cite=schafer_prl03] [\cite=gweon_prl98] [\cite=brouet_prl04]. While a great wealth of information has been learned from CDW systems, microscopic models explaining CDW mechanisms have been elusive and debated [\cite=yao_prb06] [\cite=johannes_prb06] [\cite=johannes_prb08] [\cite=malliakas_jacs05]. It has even been proposed that the idea of FS nesting is insufficient to explain the nesting vectors realized in the family of rare earth tritelluride (RTe3) compounds [\cite=johannes_prb08]. The RTe3 family offers a unique opportunity to systematically study CDW formation over a wide range of tunable parameters via rare earth substitution [\cite=dimasi_prb95] [\cite=ru_prb06] [\cite=ru_prb08] [\cite=brouet_prb08] [\cite=malliakas_jacs05]. In addition, the simple electronic structure makes RTe3 more tractable for theoretical modeling to gain a deeper understanding of the CDW phenomena and electron correlations in general [\cite=brouet_prl04] [\cite=yao_prb06] [\cite=laverock_prb05].

The CDW properties for several members of the RTe3 family have been well characterized previously [\cite=gweon_prl98] [\cite=brouet_prl04] [\cite=ru_prb06] [\cite=ru_prb08] [\cite=brouet_prb08] [\cite=dimasi_prb95]. RTe3 has a layered, weakly orthorhombic crystal structure (space group Cmcm) consisting of two planar Te nets sandwiched between buckled RTe slabs. X-ray analysis reveals an incommensurate lattice modulation characterized by a single wave vector (q  ~  2 / 7c*) [\cite=ru_prb06] [\cite=ru_prb08]. Previous ARPES studies show a partially gapped FS with the gap maximum occurring along the c-axis (i.e. Γ  -  Z or kx  =  0 since the b-axis is the long axis) [\cite=gweon_prl98] [\cite=brouet_prl04] [\cite=brouet_prb08] [\cite=komoda_prb04]. The gap evolution as a function of R is consistent with a FS nesting driven sinusoidal CDW with the bandwidth and density of states at the Fermi level (N(EF)) tuned by a shrinking unit cell [\cite=ru_prb08] [\cite=brouet_prb08] [\cite=laverock_prb05].

The recent discovery of a second CDW transition in heavier members of RTe3 is a rare display of the riches in CDW formation and a unique opportunity to further test the concept of a FS driven CDW. The second CDW was first discovered by transport measurements [\cite=ru_prb08]. It has further been confirmed by x-ray scattering displaying a second lattice modulation perpendicular to the first, parallel to the a-axis with q2  ~  1 / 3a* [\cite=ru_prb08]. We have performed ARPES investigations of ErTe3, specifically chosen since it has two well separated CDW transitions at 155 K and 267 K. Our finding further strengthens the notions of FS nesting driven CDW formation in this particular compound. Data suggest that as the rare earth ion is varied, the second CDW is formed only when the first CDW weakens with the decreasing lattice parameter, making larger FS segments available for the new nesting condition to form [\cite=ru_prb08] [\cite=brouet_prb08]. While the result can be qualitatively explained by a simple tight binding (TB) model, the data contain rich subtleties suggesting a dynamic interplay of the two CDWs. Our finding establish ErTe3 as an excellent model system to study the evolution and entanglement of two many-body states existing within the same atomic plane.

Single crystals used in this study were grown by slow cooling a binary melt and have been well characterized elsewhere [\cite=ru_prb08]. All ARPES data were taken at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory beamline 5-4 with an energy resolution of 10 meV and angular resolution of [formula].

The FS determined from ARPES is shown in Fig. [\ref=FS]. A large gapped region in the vicinity of the Γ  -  Z axis is consistent with previous studies of RTe3 members with a single CDW. While x-ray data shows qCDW2 to be parallel to the a-axis, the FS along Γ  -  X (kz  =  0) is not completely gapped at T = 10 K as shown in Fig. [\ref=FS]. The intensity is weak along the inner FS, but the outer FS retains significant spectral weight. Further inspection slightly off the Γ - X axis (kz  ~  0.07c*) reveals a second gap does appear in both the inner and outer FS pieces. In addition, several weaker features are evident in the regions around the large and small gaps just below EF. Fig. [\ref=TBModel]a is of the same data as Fig. [\ref=FS], but with a logarithmic intensity scale and slightly larger integration window to emphasize the weaker features near EF. As shown later, the weaker features provide crucial evidence for the induced FS from both CDWs. Given the complexity, there is amazing degree of agreement between data and the expected FS pieces.

While ARPES exposes distinct differences between the FS of lighter RTe3 members with a single CDW and the FS of ErTe3 [\cite=gweon_prl98] [\cite=brouet_prl04] [\cite=brouet_prb08], differences in the theoretical FS are subtle [\cite=ru_prb08]. Linear muffin tin orbital (LMTO) calculations suggest the electronic structure near EF is still dominated by the px and pz orbitals of the two Te planes [\cite=laverock_prb05] [\cite=ru_prb08] [\cite=laverock_private]. Hence, one would expect that the TB model of a single Te plane which so accurately describes other rare earth members would also accurately describe ErTe3. Details of the TB model are described elsewhere [\cite=brouet_prl04] [\cite=brouet_prb08]. A square net of Te atoms is assumed with perpendicular chains created by the in-plane px and pz orbitals (py orbitals are assumed to be filled). The model parameters consist of electron hopping terms along a particular chain ([formula]) and perpendicular to the chain ([formula]). The Fermi velocity, the slope of the bands traversing EF, is primarily determined by [formula] while a FS curvature is introduced proportional to [formula]/[formula]. In this work the TB model is expanded to not only include effects of the [formula] [formula] reduced 3D Brillouin zone on a 2D Te plane and ±  (c* - qCDW1) as used previously, but includes the second CDW with the addition of px/pz bands translated by ±  (a* - qCDW2).

To further understand the implications of two transverse CDWs on the FS, the TB model is further extended to include interactions between various bands. An electron-phonon coupled Hamiltonian is used to model the band interactions in a perturbative fashion [\cite=gruner_94] [\cite=brouet_prb08]. Interactions arising due to the 3D crystal structure and both CDWs are included in the Hamiltonian, however, only first order interactions due to band crossings arising from a single q-vector translation are included. While higher order terms are expected to exist due to the incommensurate nature of the CDWs, the intensity is expected to be extremely weak and thus can be neglected [\cite=brouet_prl04] [\cite=brouet_prb08] [\cite=voit_sci00]. The lattice parameters (a  =  c  =  4.27Å[formula] assuming a square Te net) are taken from x-ray results and all other model parameters are estimated from the data, both from the FS and band crossings occurring below EF. Since the intensity appearing in the reconstructed FS originates from the original px and pz bare bands, the color scale in the model FS is proportional to the sum of the square of the resulting px and pz eigenvector amplitudes from the interacting Hamiltonian [\cite=brouet_prb08]. The resulting reconstructed FS from the interacting TB model is shown in Fig. [\ref=TBModel]a. The spectral intensity existing near the FS corners at both kx = 0 and kz = 0 are now explained by the electron-phonon coupled TB model of the CDW. Shadow bands, bare px and pz bands translated by CDW q-vectors, correspond to weak features observed in the data revealing the two transverse CDWs.

Due to the agreement between the model FS and the observed one, the extended interacting TB model is used to characterize the CDW properties in a similar manner to previous studies of lighter RTe3 members [\cite=brouet_prb08]. The gap evolution along kx for the inner FS square is shown in Fig. [\ref=TBModel]b, demonstrating the effects of multiple CDWs. The excellent agreement between the model and experimental data suggests the observed FS is consistent with a nesting driven CDW, however, quantitative discrepancies exist which must be discussed. The model intensity at the corners of the inner FS square do not match the experimental data. This discrepancy is observed both along the Γ  -  X and Γ  -  Z directions, but is most pronounced along Γ  -  Z. This discrepancy is most likely due to the simplicity of the model, neglecting effects from higher order CDW terms, interactions beyond the nearest neighbor in-plane p-orbitals, a bi-layer splitting arising from neighboring Te planes and orthorhombicity of the unit cell [\cite=brouet_prb08]. Despite these discrepancies, the agreement justifies using such a simple model for illustration purposes. The density of states is calculated for the interacting TB model and shown in Fig. [\ref=TBModel]c. The onset of a single CDW suppresses N(EF) to ~  77% of the unmodulated value while the second CDW further suppresses N(EF) to ~  74%. Although the gains due to the second CDW are modest, mean field transition temperatures depend exponentially on N(EF). In addition, estimations of the Te bandwidth for GdTe3 (c = 4.33Å[formula]) is 4.70 eV [\cite=brouet_prb08] while for ErTe3 (c  =  4.29Å[formula]) it is 4.85 eV. While ErTe3 ARPES data is the first in the RTe3 family to show multiple gaps in the FS, the increasing bandwidth proportional to the shrinking lattice agrees with the general RTe3 trend.

Studies of lighter RTe3 members with a single CDW suggest a shrinking gap accompanies the shrinking lattice parameter, allowing a larger portion of the FS to remain intact. In addition, the gap maximum always appears along the c-axis [\cite=brouet_prb08]. Perfectly nesting the corners of the FS along each axis (i.e. c* - qCDW  ~  0.68c*) will pin the center of the CDW gap at EF [\cite=brouet_prb08]. However, observed nesting vectors and hybridization of px and pz bands effectively pushes the center of the gap below EF. This effect is most pronounced at the corners of the inner and outer FS allowing intensity to be observed in these regions. The gap magnitudes (Δ1 = 175 meV and Δ2 = 50 meV) are smaller in ErTe3 than the lighter rare earth family members (for CeTe3 Δ  ~  400 meV [\cite=brouet_prl04]) and the observed FS curvature ([formula]) is ~  15% greater in ErTe3. These differences account for the large intensity observed along Γ - X as one might expect this region to be gapped at EF based on previous RTe3 studies. With smaller gaps and larger FS curvature, the downward shift of the CDW gaps due to the length of the CDW q-vectors and px  -  pz hybridization allows intensity from the top of the CDW gaps to be observed at EF.

To further illustrate the implications of CDW formation on the FS, temperature dependent FS data are taken. One significant advantage of ErTe3 is the fact that the room temperature structure is free from any CDW [\cite=ru_prb08]. Thus this system provides a unique opportunity to observe the FS evolution across multiple CDW transitions. The large gaps observed at low temperatures for this family allow us to observe the gap opening despite thermal broadening effects. Fig. [\ref=GapVST]a-c show the FS data taken at different temperatures for one side of the inner FS and Fig. [\ref=GapVST]d-g show the temperature dependence of px / pz bands near the large and small gaps with a CDW and without. At T  =  200 K only one gap is evident, while at T  =  300 K the inner FS square is fully closed as expected from a structure unmodulated by any CDW [\cite=laverock_prb05]. To track the temperature evolution of the leading edge gap, the spectra were first divided by the temperature dependent Fermi-Dirac function convoluted with an energy resolution function [\cite=lee_nat07]. Such a procedure allows the determination of the center of the energy gap ensuring accurate measurements of gap values. In addition, since the center of the energy gap is observed below EF, CDW q-vectors used in the TB model can be determined directly from the data resulting in c* - qCDW1  ~  0.70(0)c *  and a* - qCDW2  ~  0.68(5)a * . The CDW wave vectors determined from ARPES are in excellent agreement with the lattice modulation vectors observed in x-ray data [\cite=ru_prb08]. The leading edge gap was then determined by fitting momentum distribution curve peaks with Lorentz functions and tracking the point of inflection in the fitted band dispersion after denoising via wavelet shrinkage. Instead of tracking the gaps at kx = 0 and kz = 0, temperature dependent data were taken at k-points where the gap maxima with no FS intensity are observed. Fig. [\ref=GapVST]h summarizes the temperature dependent data showing both gaps closing. A mean-field order parameter curve scaled to the maximum observed gap is also plotted for comparison. The smaller Δ2 and larger Δ1 gaps are observed to close at TC2  ~  160 K and [formula] K, respectively, in good agreement with the transport and x-ray data [\cite=ru_prb08]. The development of the gaps appears to be second order within the experimental uncertainty as no hysteresis has been observed. While the closing of the gaps is suggestive of a mean-field type behavior, Δ1(T) is somewhat suppressed from the mean-field curve. In addition, it should be noted that 2Δ1  /  kBTC1 is ~  2(2Δ2  /  kBTC2) while the area of the FS gapped by Δ1 is ~  3 times the area gapped by Δ2.

The observed q-vectors, the observation of CDW gaps below the Fermi-level and the use of an electron-phonon coupled model Hamiltonian may suggest the FS plays little role in the formation of the CDWs [\cite=johannes_prb08]. However, caution is advised as the model FS in Fig. [\ref=TBModel]a is not the one electron eigenvalues resulting from the mixing of the different bands. To accurately model the FS, the calculated spectral weight (px and pz eigenvectors) had to be used. The FS in Fig. [\ref=GapVST]c is also a poor match for the model FS eigenvalues with no CDWs because the bare bands folded back into the reduced 3D Brillouin zone are too weak to be observed. Lowering of the ground state energy is achieved by gapping the FS and the model spectral weight suggest the shape of the FS could still play a significant role in the CDW formation.

Both CDWs exist within the same Te plane [\cite=ru_prb08], thus both CDWs modulate the positions of the same Te atoms. Hence, ErTe3 offers a unique opportunity to directly study the crossover from quasi-1D to quasi-2D behavior. Upon initial inspection, each CDW appears uni-directional and completely decoupled. However, suppression of Δ1(T) from the mean-field curve, the discrepancy between 2Δ1 / kBTC2 and 2Δ2 / kBTC2 still need to be explained. Such discrepancies may arise due to the interplay between the two many body states. Subtle complexities arising from the crystal structure could interfere with the delicate balance between the lattice and electronic energies, allowing for interactions between the two CDWs to arise. More experimental and theoretical work is required to explore such possibilities.
