Dispersion relation of an electromagnetic wave in unmagnetized cold plasma

Introduction

It is well known that the dispersion relation of a plane electromagnetic wave in an unmagnetized neutral cold plasma is given by ω2  =  ω2p + c2k2. To derive this, it has been assumed that the electron oscillations in the transverse direction are of the same amplitude for all the electrons on a plane perpendicular to a given point on the axis. Though this assumption is true in theory, but questionable in practice. In any real experiment, the electrons will oscillate with varying amplitude in the transverse direction. This could happen due to boundary effects or many other reasons. This effect can be small or large depending on the problem at hand. For large amplitude variations, the above dispersion relation will certainly breakdown. The question at hand is: Does the above dispersion relation hold in the case of arbitrarily small differences in the amplitude of single electron oscillations in the transverse direction? Before we answer this, let us consider the nature of langmuir oscillations.

The nature of langmuir oscillations is very peculiar. For a 1d neutral cold plasma, the dispersion relation for langmuir waves is ω  =  ωp. This dispersion relation does not seem to depend on k, but there is indeed a dependence. The correct way of writing the dispersion relation for a langmuir wave is:

[formula]

This is a very peculiar dispersion relation because ω is not a smooth function of k. There is an abrupt jump at k = 0. This dispersion relation also holds in the nonlinear limit. The only thing to make sure is that the wave amplitude should not be large enough to cause wave-breaking.

As discussed before, when a plane electromagnetic wave propagates in a plasma, we derive its dispersion relation assuming that there is no variation in the transverse direction. In any practical system, this is certainly not true. The assumption made is valid for systems where the scale length of transverse variation is much larger compared to the scale length of longitudinal variation. But no matter how small the transverse variation may be, it will always be non-zero. And the derivation of langmuir waves shows that all that we need to have electrostatic oscillations at ω  =  ωp is a non-zero k. This k can be as small as we like, but as long as it is > 0, we will certainly have electrostatic oscillations. This may sound trivial, but has very important implications.

Thus, when an electromagnetic wave travels in a plasma, there will always be electrostatic oscillations along the transverse direction. And, as we will see, these electrostatic oscillations do modify the dispersion relation of the electromagnetic wave.

We first derive the known dispersion relation for em waves in a plasma. Then, we add the electrostatic restoring force and show how it modifies the em wave dispersion relation.

Usual Derivation

This derivation is given in any book on plasma physics[\cite=nicholson]. I am reproducing it here for the benefit of the reader.

The momentum equation is:

[formula]

And the two Maxwell's equations required are:

[formula]

Under the linear approximation, we drop the nonlinear terms in the momentum equation. Then the momentum equation becomes,

[formula]

[formula]

Differentiating the first of the Maxwell's equation listed w.r.t. time and substituting appropriately, we get,

[formula]

Now, since [formula], we get,

[formula]

Now, on fourier transforming in space and time, we get the usual dispersion relation:

[formula]

A twist in the tale

As explained in the introduction, as the electrons oscillate perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave, they will experience a restoring force due to ions due to infinitesimally small differences in the amplitude of electron motion in the transverse direction. And as long as wave breaking does not happen, this restoring force will be proportional to the displacement of the particle. This is true even in the nonlinear regime, as was shown by Dawson [\cite=dawsom].

We assume that the em wave is polarized along the x̂ direction and travels along the ẑ direction. Thus, the correct momentum equation for the electrons should be,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The Maxwell's equation was,

[formula]

[formula]

If ω  ≫  ωp, then the above expression reduces to the conventional dispersion relation, ω2  =  ω2p + c2k2.

The above expression gives,

[formula]

[formula]

For ck  ≪  ωp, we have,

[formula]

If ck  ≫  ωp, we have,

[formula]

As can be seem from the above expressions, ω  <  ωp is an allowed solution of the dispersion relation. We can get this by taking the -ve sign in the above expressions. This seems to an anomaly since it is conventionally believed that for ω  <  ωP , the em wave should not be able to penetrate in the plasma. There are two possibilities: Either the em wave with ω  <  ωP does actually penetrate into the plasma or there is some reason for us to discard the -ve sign in the above expression. This question can be answered only by more careful experiments in the future.

One could argue saying that the above field is not purely electromagnetic since we have also included an electrostatic component in the transverse direction. It does not really matter by what name we call it. All that matters is that the dispersion relation of a "initially" transverse wave in a plasma seems to be given by

I would be glad to receive comments and views on this article through email. I am open to both sides of the arguments. If you can find a flaw in the above arguments and prove that this wrong, you are welcome. And if you have evidence or a strong reason to say that the above could be right, then of course, you are most welcome.
