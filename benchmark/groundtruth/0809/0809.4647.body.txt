Introduction

In this paper we are interested in the frame expansions of elements in [formula], where [formula] are Banach spaces, which corresponds to [formula], where [formula] are Banach sequence spaces. We introduce Fréchet frames (cf. [\cite=pst], also) and in this context we are interested in the problem of determination of [formula] (resp. [formula]) for given frame {gi}∞i = 1 and given [formula] (resp. [formula]). Our approach is different from the approach of Feichtinger and Gröchening [\cite=GFa] [\cite=FGb] who have used orbit, respectively, coorbit spaces, for the construction of a linear space with coefficients in a given sequence space, respectively, for the construction of a sequence space which corresponds to a given function space. Our main aim is the analysis of conditions on {gi}∞i = 1, Θ0 and X0 and their subspaces in order to obtain a fine characterization of f belonging to a subspace of X0 which can be a Banach space or a Fréchet space, through the properties of the corresponding sequence of coefficients {gi(f)}∞i = 1.

Historically, theory of frames appeared in the paper of Duffin and Schaeffer [\cite=ds] in 1952. Around 1986, Daubechies, Grossmann, Meyer [\cite=DGM] and others reconsidered ideas of Duffin and Schaeffer, and started to develop the wavelet and frame theory. Banach frames were introduced by Gröchenig [\cite=G] and subsequently many mathematicians have contributed to this theory, see for example [\cite=AST] [\cite=ASTproc] [\cite=Cas] [\cite=CCS] [\cite=CH] and references therein. In the last years, Banach frames for families of Banach spaces were studied in several papers. Using a tight wavelet frame for [formula], Borup, Gribonval and Nielsen [\cite=BN] obtained a Θp-frame for [formula] for an appropriate sequence space Θp, which gives series expansions in [formula], 1 < p <   ∞  . Gröchenig and his collaborators [\cite=cogr2] [\cite=forgr] [\cite=Gr3], considered localized frames and through the orbit and coorbit spaces obtained Banach frames for a family of Banach spaces. Considering p-frames for shift-invariant subspaces of Lp, Aldroubi, Sun and Tung [\cite=AST] proved that when a sequence of translations of a finite set of appropriate functions φ1,...,φr forms an [formula]-frame for the shift-invariant space Vp0(φ)  ⊂  Lp0, for some p0 > 1, then this sequence is also an [formula]-frame for Vp(φ) for all values of p > 1.

In the present paper we consider the following problems:

Determine conditions, which imply series expansions in projective and inductive limits of Banach spaces.

Let [formula] be a sequence of Banach spaces such that Xs  ⊂  Xs - 1  ⊂  X0, [formula], in the topological sense also, and [formula] be dense in every space Xs. Let [formula] be a family of Banach sequence spaces with similar properties. We determine conditions on a sequence [formula], [formula], which imply the existence of [formula], [formula], such that every [formula] and every [formula] can be written as [formula] and [formula].

For given Θ0-frame [formula] for X0 and given sequence [formula] (resp. [formula]), construct [formula] (resp. [formula]) so that [formula] is a pre-F-frame or F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF.

Let [formula] be a Θ0-frame for X0 and let [formula] be a sequence of Banach spaces such that Xs  ⊂  Xs - 1  ⊂  X0, [formula], in the topological sense also. The question is whether there exists a decreasing sequence of Banach sequence spaces [formula] so that [formula] is a Θs-frame for Xs, [formula]. Also, if Θs  ⊂  Θs - 1  ⊂  Θ0, [formula] is given, whether there exists a corresponding sequence [formula] so that [formula] is a Θs-frame for Xs, [formula]. These problems are interesting in itself for Banach spaces, but if one also imposes the condition that [formula] and [formula] are dense in Θs, respectively, Xs, [formula] then one comes to pre-F- and F-frames and to the frame theory for spaces of test functions and their duals, various spaces of generalized functions.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=s2p] we give the definitions of pre-F- and F- frames for a Fréchet space XF with respect to a Fréchet sequence space ΘF. Moreover, we introduce pre-DF- and DF-frames motivated by the properties of dual frames in Banach spaces. The frame expansions in Fréchet spaces and their duals are the subject of Section 3. We note that for a Fréchet space XF, which is not a Banach space, the existence of a pre-F-frame [formula] implies that the corresponding sequence space ΘF must be a Fréchet space, which is not a Banach space (Remark [\ref=motiv]). Let [formula] be a Θ0-frame for X0. In Section [\ref=constrfx] we construct a sequence [formula] for given [formula] and a sequence [formula] for given [formula] so that [formula] is a pre-F-frame or F-frame for [formula] with respect to [formula]. In Subsection [\ref=subs43] we construct a new sequence space [formula], so that given Θ-frame for X (resp. Banach frame for X with respect to Θ) is a [formula]-frame for X (resp. Banach frame for X with respect to [formula]). With this construction, if [formula] is a decreasing sequence of Banach spaces, we formulate conditions which imply the existence of a sequence [formula] so that given Θ0-Bessel sequence for X0 is a pre-F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF and open questions related to Fréchet frames for such sequences [formula] and [formula]. Our analysis is illustrated by Propositions [\ref=primer1] and [\ref=hilbcor], which show that the assumptions of Theorems [\ref=constructone] and [\ref=constructthetas] are essential in the construction of frames.

Preliminaries

We use usual notation: [formula] is a Banach space and [formula] is its dual, [formula] is a Banach sequence space and [formula] is the dual of Θ. Recall that Θ is called solid if the conditions {ci}∞i = 1∈Θ and |di|  ≤  |ci|, [formula], imply that {di}∞i = 1∈Θ and [formula] If the coordinate functionals on Θ are continuous, then Θ is called a BK-space. A BK-space, for which the canonical vectors form a Schauder basis, is called a CB-space. If otherwise is not written, ei will denote the i-th canonical vector {δki}∞k = 1, [formula]. A BK-space Θ, which contains all the canonical vectors and for which there exists λ  ≥  1 such that

[formula]

([formula]), is called a λ-BK-space.

When Θ is a CB-space, then the canonical basis constant [formula] is a finite number ≥  1, where

[formula]

(see [\cite=Heil]). Every CB-space is a λ-BK-space, where λ is the canonical basis constant. If Θ is a CB-space, then the space [formula] with the norm [formula] is a BK-space, isometrically isomorphic to Θ* (see [\cite=KA]). When Θ is a reflexive CB-space, then the coefficient functionals Ei, [formula], associated to the canonical basis ei, [formula], form a Schauder basis for Θ* (see [\cite=Heil]) and thus [formula] is a CB-space, since the canonical vectors {Ej(ei)}∞i = 1, [formula], form a Schauder basis for [formula]. From now on when Θ is a CB-space, we will always identify Θ* with [formula]. In the sequel, linear mappings will be called operators. Recall that an operator P:X  →  X is called projestion if P2  =  P.

Pre-Fréchet and Fréchet frames

Let [formula] be a sequence of separable Banach spaces such that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Then YF is a Fréchet space with the sequence of norms |  ·  |s, [formula] We will use such sequences in two cases:

1. Ys = Xs with norm [formula]

2. Ys  =  Θs with norm [formula].

Note that if the norms |  ·  |s, [formula], satisfy |  ·  |s  ≤  Cs|  ·  |s + 1, Cs > 0, [formula], then new norms can be introduced in Ys, [formula] so that ([\ref=fx2]) holds.

1. If [formula] is a sequence of CB-spaces, which satisfies ([\ref=fx1]) and ([\ref=fx2]), then all finite sequences belong to ΘF and form a dense subset of Θs; thus ([\ref=fx3]) is automatically satisfied. In this case the canonical vectors form a Schauder basis of ΘF, every [formula] can be written uniquely as [formula] with the convergence in Θs for every [formula].

2. We refer to [\cite=MV] for Köthe type sequence spaces λp(A) and their duals as a good source of examples of sequence spaces.

Let [formula] and [formula] be sequences of Banach spaces, which satisfy ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]). For fixed [formula], an operator V:ΘF  →  XF will be called s-bounded, if there exists a constant Ks > 0 such that [formula] for all [formula]. If V is s-bounded for every [formula], then V will be called F-bounded.

Note that if V:ΘF  →  XF is F-bounded, then V is continuous. The converse does not hold in general.

Let Θ be a BK-space. Recall that [formula] is called a Θ-frame for X with lower bound A > 0 and upper bound B <   ∞  , if

[formula]

A Θ-frame [formula] for X is called a Banach frame for X with respect to Θ if there exists a continuous operator V:Θ  →  X such that V({gi(f)}∞i = 1) = f for every f∈X.

If at least the upper inequality in ([\ref=cl]) holds, then [formula] is called a Θ-Bessel sequence for X with bound B.

We generalize the above definitions to Fréchet spaces as follows:

Let [formula] be a sequence of Banach spaces, which satisfies ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]), and let [formula] be a sequence of BK-spaces, which satisfies ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]). A sequence [formula] is called a pre-F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF if for every [formula] there exist constants 0 < As  ≤  Bs  <    ∞   such that

[formula]

[formula]

The constants Bs (resp. As), [formula], are called upper (resp. lower) bounds for [formula]. A pre-F-frame is called tight, if [formula].

Moreover, if there exists an F-bounded operator V:ΘF  →  XF so that V({gi(f)}∞i = 1) = f for all [formula] then a pre-F-frame [formula] is called an F-frame (Fréchet frame) for XF with respect to ΘF and V is called an F-frame operator for [formula].

When ([\ref=fframestar]) and at least the upper inequality in ([\ref=fframetwostar]) hold, then [formula] is called an F-Bessel sequence for XF with respect to ΘF with bounds Bs, [formula].

If X  =  XF  =  Xs and Θ  =  ΘF  =  Θs, [formula] the above definitions of a pre-F-frame, F-frame and F-Bessel sequence for XF give the definitions of a Θ-frame, Banach frame and Θ-Bessel sequence for X, respectively.

Note that if Θ is a reflexive Banach space and [formula] is a Θ-frame for a Banach space X, then X is also reflexive because it is isomorphic to a closed subspace of Θ.

Let [formula] be a sequence of Banach spaces which satisfies ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]), [formula] be a sequence of BK-spaces which satisfies ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]) and [formula] be an F-Bessel sequence for XF with respect to ΘF. Fix [formula] and [formula]. Since Θs is a BK-space, the i-th coordinate functional on Θs is bounded and thus there exists Ki,s > 0 such that [formula], [formula]. Therefore, by the upper inequality in ([\ref=fframetwostar]), gi is bounded on XF with respect to the norm [formula]. Now by ([\ref=fx3]) it follows that gi has a unique continuous extension on Xs which will be denoted by gsi. Thus, for every [formula], [formula], [formula], and moreover, gsi|Xt = gti, [formula], for t > s.

Let [formula] be a sequence of Banach spaces, which satisfies ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]), and let [formula] be a sequence of λs-BK-spaces, which satisfies ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]). If [formula] is an F-Bessel sequence (resp. pre-F-frame) for XF with respect to ΘF with bounds Bs (resp. lower bounds As and upper bounds Bs), [formula], then for any [formula], [formula] is a Θs-Bessel sequence (resp. Θs-frame) for Xs with bound λsBs (resp. lower bound As and upper bound λsBs).

In the case of a single Banach space (X  =  XF  =  Xs, Θ  =  ΘF  =  Θs, [formula]) the following assertion holds.

[\cite=Sduals] Let Θ be a CB-space and [formula] be a Θ-Bessel sequence for X. Consider the conditions:

[formula] is a Banach frame for X with respect to Θ.

There exists a Θ*-Bessel sequence [formula] ([formula]) for X* such that [formula]

There exists a Θ*-Bessel sequence [formula] ([formula]) for X* such that [formula]

Then:

(P1)  ⇔  (P2).

If both Θ and Θ* are CB-spaces, then (P1)  ⇔  (P2)  ⇔  (P3) and each one of the conditions (P2) and (P3) implies that [formula] is a Θ*-frame for X*, called a dual of the Θ-frame [formula].

If Θ is a reflexive CB-space, then each one of the conditions (P2) and (P3) implies that [formula] is a Banach frame for X* with respect to Θ*.

We will extend the above proposition to Fréchet spaces and obtain series expansions by the use of a Fréchet frame and the corresponding dual frame.

Once again we note that the sequence [formula] in Proposition [\ref=bnew] has dual properties in comparison to [formula]: fi belongs to X while gi belongs to X*, [formula], [formula] is a Θ*-Bessel sequence for X* while [formula] is a Θ-Bessel sequence for X. Having this in mind as well as Proposition [\ref=gs], we give the following definition:

Let all the assumptions of Definition [\ref=fframe] hold and assume moreover, that Θs, [formula], are CB-spaces (then their duals are BK-spaces). A sequence [formula] is called a

DF-Bessel sequence for X*F with respect to Θ*F if it is a Θ*s-Bessel sequence for X*s for every [formula];

pre-DF-frame for X*F with respect to Θ*F if it is a Θ*s-frame for X*s for every [formula];

DF-frame for X*F with respect to Θ*F if it is a Banach frame for X*s with respect to Θ*s for every [formula].

Series Expansions

Throughout this section we assume:

[formula] is a sequence of Banach spaces, satisfying ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]);

[formula] is a sequence of λs-BK-spaces, satisfying ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]);

[formula].

Let [formula] be a pre-F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF with lower bounds As and upper bounds Bs, [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=gs], for every [formula],

[formula]

By ([\ref=asb2]) and ([\ref=fframetwostar]), one can consider the following continuous operators

[formula]

and their inverses

[formula]

For every [formula], the operator U- 1s is bounded with [formula].

Let [formula] be a pre-F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF. The range R(U) of the operator  U, defined by ([\ref=operatoru]), is closed in ΘF and the inverse operator U- 1 is F-bounded.

Proof.   Denote the lower bounds for [formula] by [formula], and the upper bounds by [formula]. Let [formula], [formula], be such that {Ufn}∞n = 1 converges in ΘF as n  →    ∞  . Fix ε > 0 and [formula]. Then there exists [formula] such that [formula] for every n,k  >  N0(s). By the lower inequality in ([\ref=asb2]), we obtain

[formula]

and hence {fn}∞n = 1 converges in Xs as n  →    ∞  . Therefore, {fn}∞n = 1 converges to some f in XF. Hence, [formula] is the limit of {Ufn}∞n = 1 in ΘF. This implies that R(U) is closed in ΘF.

Since for every {ci}∞i = 1∈R(U) and every [formula],

[formula]

it follows that U- 1 is F-bounded. [formula]

Assume that Θs  =  Θ for every [formula] and that [formula] is a pre-F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF  =  Θ. In this case XF is isomorphic to R(U), which is a closed subspace of Θ by the above lemma. Hence, XF is isomorphic to a Banach space. This explains that in the case when XF is not a Banach space, ΘF must not be a Banach space. Thus, different sequence spaces Θs must be used for the construction of ΘF.

Consider a pre-F-frame [formula] for XF with respect to ΘF. The mapping V (if it exists) in Definition [\ref=fframe] is an F-bounded extension of  U- 1 and the operator UV is an F-bounded projection from ΘF onto R(U). Conversely, assume that there exists an F-bounded projection P from ΘF onto R(U). In this case the operator U- 1P:ΘF  →  XF is an F-bounded extension of U- 1:R(U)  →  XF. Therefore, a pre-F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF is an F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF if and only if there exists an F-bounded projection from ΘF onto R(U).

Let [formula] be an F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF. Then the following holds.

For every [formula], the sequence {gsi}∞i = 1 is a Banach frame for Xs with respect to Θs.

If  Θs, [formula], are CB-spaces, then there exists [formula], which is a DF-Bessel sequence for X*F with respect to Θ*F such that

[formula]

If  Θs and Θ*s, [formula], are CB-spaces, then there exists [formula], which is a pre-DF-frame for X*F with respect to Θ*F such that ([\ref=frepr])-([\ref=fsrepr]) hold and moreover,

[formula]

If  Θs, [formula], are reflexive CB-spaces, then there exists [formula], which is a DF-frame for X*F with respect to Θ*F such that ([\ref=frepr])-([\ref=xs]) hold.

Proof.   Having in mind Remark [\ref=ffrp], let P denote an F-bounded projection from ΘF onto R(U). Fix [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=gs], {gsi}∞i = 1 is a Θs-frame for Xs and thus we can consider the operator Us, given by ([\ref=operatorus]). Consider P as an operator from ΘF  ⊆  Θs into R(Us) and note that R(Us) is a closed subspace of Θs. Since ΘF is dense in Θs and R(U) is dense in R(Us), P has unique continuous extension Ps defined from Θs into R(Us) and moreover, Ps is a projection from Θs onto R(Us). Define Vs:Θs  →  Xs by Vs: = U- 1sPs.

(a) For every [formula], Vs is a continuous extension of U- 1s and hence the Θs-frame {gsi}∞i = 1 is a Banach frame for Xs with respect to Θs.

(b) Consider the operator V = U -  1P, which is an F-bounded extension of U- 1. Since all the canonical vectors belong to ΘF, for [formula] we define fi: = Vei. Let f∈XF. By Remark [\ref=novr] applied to [formula],

[formula]

The continuity of V implies that

[formula]

Hence, [formula] in XF, as n  →    ∞  . Moreover, ([\ref=frepr]) implies ([\ref=frepr2]).

Let [formula]. Since Ps is an extension of P and U- 1s is an extension of U -  1, it follows that Vs is an extension of V. Therefore, Vsei = Vei = fi, [formula]. By the fact that [formula] is a Schauder basis for Θs, it follows that for every [formula],

[formula]

Let now g∈X*s. Then gVs∈Θ*s, [formula] and

[formula]

Therefore, [formula] is a Θ*s-Bessel sequence for X*s.

(c) Let [formula]. Proposition [\ref=bnew](b) implies that the sequence [formula], determined in (b), is a Θ*s-frame for X*s. Now ([\ref=xs]) follows from ([\ref=fsrepr]) and [\cite=Sduals].

(d) Consider the sequence [formula] defined in (b). Let [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=bnew](c) it follows that [formula] is a Banach frame for X*s with respect to Θ*s. [formula]

Note, for validity of ([\ref=frepr]) and ([\ref=frepr2]) it is enough to assume that there exits a continuous projection P from ΘF onto R(U). The F-boundedness of P is essential for ([\ref=fsrepr]), ([\ref=xs]) and (a).

If [formula] is an F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF and Θs, [formula], are CB-spaces, Theorem [\ref=diff] (a) and Proposition [\ref=bnew] imply that for every [formula] there exists a sequence [formula] such that [formula] for every [formula]. The sequences [formula] might be different for different s. Since our aim is to obtain series expansions in XF, we need a same sequence [formula] satisfying [formula], [formula], with convergence in [formula]-norm for every [formula]. Because of that we have Theorem [\ref=diff] (b) determining a sequence [formula], which gives series expansions on every level s, [formula].

In order to have series expansions in XF via a pre-F-frame (or F-Bessel sequence) [formula] and a DF-Bessel sequence [formula], one must have that [formula] is an F-frame. This will be proved in the next theorem.

Let Θs, [formula], be CB-spaces and [formula] be an F-Bessel sequence for XF with respect to ΘF. Then the following holds.

There exists [formula], such that it is a DF-Bessel sequence for X*F with respect to Θ*F and satisfies ([\ref=frepr]) if and only if [formula] is an F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF.

Let [formula] be a DF-Bessel sequence for X*F with respect to Θ*F which satisfies ([\ref=frepr]). If both Θs and Θ*s are CB-spaces, [formula], (resp. Θs is a reflexive CB-space, [formula]), then [formula] is a pre-DF-frame (resp. DF-frame) for X*F with respect to Θ*F.

Proof.   (a) If [formula] is an F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF, the assertion is given by Theorem [\ref=diff].

For the converse, assume that [formula] is a DF-Bessel sequence for X*F with respect to Θ*F which satisfies ([\ref=frepr]). First we will prove that ([\ref=fsrepr]) holds. Fix [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=gs], {gsi}∞i = 1 is a Θs-Bessel sequence for Xs and thus the operator Us, given by ([\ref=operatorus]), is bounded. Let ε > 0 and [formula]. Since XF is dense in Xs, there exists [formula] such that [formula]. Applying ([\ref=frepr]) to h, there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Let λs denote the canonical basis constant in Θs (see the preliminaries). Since [formula], we have

[formula]

Since [formula] is a Θ*s-Bessel sequence for X*s, by [\cite=CCS], the operator [formula] is bounded from Θs into Xs. Thus for n > N,

[formula]

and hence [formula]. Now Proposition [\ref=bnew](a) implies that {gsi}∞i = 1 is a Banach frame for Xs with respect to Θs.

In order to conclude that [formula] is an F-frame, it remains to prove that there exists an F-bounded extension of U- 1. For every [formula], the series [formula] converges in Xs for every [formula] and therefore it converges in XF. Thus the operator T, given by [formula], is defined from ΘF into XF. For every [formula], T = Ts|ΘF and hence T is s-bounded. Since [formula] is a Schauder basis for ΘF and T is continuous on ΘF, it follows that [formula] and

[formula]

i.e. T is an extension of U- 1.

(b) Assume now that both Θs and Θ*s are CB-spaces. By the proof in (a), it follows that ([\ref=fsrepr]) holds. Now Proposition [\ref=bnew](b) implies that [formula] is a Θ*s-frame for X*s. Moreover, if Θs is a reflexive CB-space, then Proposition [\ref=bnew](c) implies that [formula] is a Banach frame for X*s with respect to Θ*s. [formula]

Note that Theorems [\ref=diff] and [\ref=nec] clarify Theorem 5.3 in [\cite=pst], where this theorem was quoted without proof.

Throughout this section we have considered [formula] which is an F-Bessel sequence for XF with respect to ΘF, at least. For such a sequence [formula] we have that [formula] and gsi = g0i|Xs. If instead of [formula] it is assumed that [formula] belongs to [formula], then ([\ref=fx2]) implies that gi|Xs is continuous on Xs for every [formula] and thus {gi|XF}∞i = 1 belongs to [formula]. Therefore, all the assertions in the present section can be stated with [formula] instead of [formula] and {gi|Xs}∞i = 1 instead of [formula].

We end this section with an example in which we use notation, notions and results of [\cite=AST].

Let [formula] When φ∈L∞ and p∈(1,  ∞  ), the series [formula] converges for every [formula] (in Lp-sense) and

[formula]

is a shift invariant subspace of [formula], but not necessarily closed in [formula]. Assertions in [\cite=AST] state that if φ∈L∞ and [formula] is a p-frame for Vp(φ), then:

Vp(φ) is closed in Lp;

[formula] is an r-frame for Vr(φ) for every r∈(1,  ∞  );

[formula] ψ∈L∞ such that [formula] is a p-frame for Vp(ψ) = Vp(φ) and

[formula]

Moreover, the function ψ belongs to V1(φ)  ⊂  Vp(φ) and it is independent of p, [formula].

Let now φ∈L∞ and [formula] be a 2-frame for V2(φ). As an example of a sequence of subspaces of X0 = V2(φ) and sequence of subspaces of [formula], consider

[formula]

By the well known properties of the [formula]-spaces, it follows that Θs + 1  ⊂  Θs and [formula]. Moreover, [formula] and finite sequences are dense in ΘF. By 2), [formula] is a Θs-frame for Xs for every [formula]; let As and Bs, [formula], denote lower and the upper bounds, respectively. Let [formula]. By ([\ref=vpspace]) and the inclusion [formula], one obtains that Xs + 1  ⊂  Xs and moreover, for every [formula] one has

[formula]

which implies that [formula] for some constant Cs > 0, [formula]. Also, the set [formula] is a subset of XF and it is dense in any Xs, [formula]. Thus, [formula] is a pre-F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF, where

[formula]

Let [formula], where ψ is given by 3). Then ([\ref=frepr]) holds and Theorem [\ref=nec] implies that [formula] is an F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF.

Constructions of sequences of spaces

For the analysis of series expansions, it is reasonable to have that the sequence space is a CB-space, which is not always the case. But if [formula] and there exists a sequence [formula] such that [formula], for all [formula], then there exists a CB-space Θ such that [formula] is a Banach frame for X with respect to Θ (see [\cite=CCS]). Below we apply this assertion to the Fréchet case.

Let [formula] be a sequence of Banach spaces, which satisfies ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]) and [formula]. Assume that there is a sequence [formula] such that for every [formula] and every f∈Xs,

[formula]

Then there exists a sequence [formula] of CB-spaces which satisfies ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]) and such that {gi|XF}∞i = 1 is an F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF. Moreover, [formula] is a DF-Bessel sequence for X*F with respect to Θ*F.

Proof.   For every [formula], put

[formula]

[formula]

By [\cite=CCS] applied to Xs, it follows that Θs is a CB-space and {gi|Xs}∞i = 1 is a Banach frame for Xs with respect to Θs. Since Xs + 1  ⊆  Xs and [formula], it follows that Θs + 1  ⊆  Θs and [formula]. By Remark [\ref=novr], [formula] satisfies ([\ref=fx3]). By ([\ref=ts]), [formula] converges in Xs as n  →    ∞   for every [formula]. Thus, [\cite=CCS] implies that [formula] is a Θ*s-Bessel sequence for X*s. By Theorem [\ref=nec](a), [formula] is an F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF. [formula]

Construction of [formula]

We start with a sequence [formula] and a Θ0-frame [formula] for X0 in order to construct [formula] such that [formula] is an F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF.

Let [formula] be a Banach space, [formula] be a sequence of BK-spaces which satisfies ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]) and [formula] be a Θ0-frame for X0 with respect to Θ0 with bounds 1  ≤  A0  ≤  B0  <    ∞  . Assume that

[formula]

is dense in [formula] with respect to the [formula]-norm for every [formula]. Then there exists a sequence of Banach spaces [formula], which satisfies ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]) and such that {gi|XF}∞i = 1 is a pre-F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF with bounds A0,B0,As  =  Bs = 1, [formula].

If moreover, there exists an F-bounded projection from ΘF onto M, then {gi|XF}∞i = 1 is an F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF.

Proof.   For every [formula], define

[formula]

Let [formula]. Clearly, Xs is a linear space, [formula] is a norm and furthermore, Xs + 1  ⊆  Xs. Moreover, for every f∈Xs,

[formula]

Let {hn}∞n = 1 be a Cauchy sequence in Xs and hence, by ([\ref=ns]), a Cauchy sequence in X0. Therefore, {hn}∞n = 1 converges to some element [formula] and by the upper Θ0-frame inequality it follows that

[formula]

By ([\ref=normss]), {gi(hn)}∞i = 1, [formula], is a Cauchy sequence in Θs and it converges to some element a in Θs. Since [formula] the sequence {gi(hn)}∞i = 1, [formula], converges to a in Θ0 and hence, by ([\ref=ghn]), [formula]. Therefore, [formula] and

[formula]

Thus, Xs is a complete space.

By ([\ref=normss]), {gi|Xs}∞i = 1 is a tight Θs-frame for Xs with frame bounds As = Bs = 1.

Denote [formula]. It remains to show the density of XF in Xs, [formula]. Since [formula] is a Θ0-frame for X0, the operator U0:X0  →  Θ0, U0f = {gi(f)}∞i = 1, is injective. Observe that XF = U- 10(M) and hence [formula], because [formula]. Fix [formula]. Let [formula] and ε > 0. Since M = U0(XF) is dense in [formula], there exists ∈XF such that [formula] and hence, [formula].

Therefore, {gi|XF}∞i = 1 is a pre-F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF.

Assume now that there is an F-bounded projection from ΘF onto M. Since M = U0(XF) = R(U), the pre-F-frame {gi|XF}∞i = 1 is an F-frame.

Note that if X0  =  Xs (as sets) for some s  ≥  1 and thus X0 = Xt = Xs for any 0 < t  ≤  s, then [formula] and [formula] are equivalent norms for any 0  ≤  t  ≤  s. This is a consequence of the Inverse Mapping Theorem. [formula]

The following simple example shows a case when all the assumptions of the above proposition are fulfilled.

Let [formula] be a sequence of CB-spaces which satisfies ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]) and let X0  =  Θ0. Let [formula] be the sequence of the coordinate functionals, associated to the canonical basis [formula] of  Θ0, i.e. [formula], [formula]. Clearly, {gi}∞i = 1 is a Θ0-frame for Θ0 with bounds A0 = B0 = 1. For every [formula] the space Xs, constructed in the proof of Theorem [\ref=constructx], coincides with Θs and [formula]. In this case M = ΘF = R(U) and {gi|XF}∞i = 1 is an F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF.

Construction of [formula] - restrictive case

In the subsections which are to follow we consider the problem opposite to the one in the previous subsection: given [formula] construct [formula].

Let [formula] be a sequence of Banach spaces, which satisfies ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]). Let Θ be a BK-space and let [formula] satisfy the lower Θ-frame condition for X0, i.e. there exists a constant A > 0 such that {gi(f)}∞i = 1∈Θ and [formula] for every [formula]. Then the following holds.

(a) There exists a sequence [formula] of BK-spaces, which satisfies ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]), such that {gi|XF}∞i = 1 is an F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF with bounds As = Bs = 1, [formula].

(b) If [formula] has a biorthogonal sequence [formula], then the spaces Θs, [formula], constructed in (a), are CB-spaces if and only if [formula] is a Schauder basis of Xs, [formula].

Proof.   (a) The lower Θ-frame inequality implies the unique correspondence of f to {gi(f)}∞i = 1. This leads to the following definition:

[formula]

Let [formula]. Clearly, Θs is a linear space, [formula] is a norm in Θs and Θs + 1  ⊆  Θs. It is easy to see that Θs is complete and [formula].

For [formula], let Ek denote the k-th coordinate functional Ek({ci}∞i = 1) = ck. For every [formula] one has

[formula]

which implies that Ek is continuous on Θs, [formula]. Thus, Θs is a BK-space. Moreover, [formula], because [formula] and gi  ≠  0 for at least one [formula]. Furthermore, for every [formula], ΘF is dense in Θs, because XF is dense in Xs, which is isomorphic to Θs.

By ([\ref=ths]), {gi|XF}∞i = 1 is a pre-F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF with bounds As = Bs = 1, [formula]. Since [formula], ([\ref=ths]) implies that the operator V:ΘF  →  XF given by V({gi(f)}) = f is s-bounded for every [formula]. Thus, {gi|XF}∞i = 1 is an F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF.

(b) Let [formula] have a biorthogonal sequence [formula]. Consider [formula] constructed in (a). Fix [formula] and [formula]. By the definition of Θs, for every [formula], the k-th canonical vector ek  =  {gi(fk)}∞i = 1 belongs to Θs. By the biorthogonality, we have

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

This implies that

[formula]

The conclusion now follows from the fact that the sequence [formula], which has [formula] as a biorthogonal sequence, is a Schauder basis of Xs if and only if [formula] for every [formula] (see e.g. [\cite=Singer], also [\cite=Heil]). [formula]

The example which is to follow illustrates the above theorem.

Let {hn}∞n = 0 be the Hermite basis of [formula]:

[formula]

where Hn(x) = ( - 1)n  ex2(d / dx)n  (e- x2), [formula], is the n-th Hermite polynomial, [formula]. The harmonic oscilator [formula] has eigenvalues λn = 2n + 1, [formula]. Define

[formula]

Then [formula] is a sequence of Hilbert spaces, which satisfies ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]) and [formula] is an orthonormal basis for Xs for every [formula]. Moreover, [formula], defined by ([\ref=ths]), is a sequence of CB-spaces, which satisfies ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]) and {gi|XF}∞i = 1 is an F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF.

As it was already noted, the CB-property is crucial for the series expansions via Banach frames. Because of that, in Theorem [\ref=constrth1] (b) we point out construction of CB-spaces Θs, [formula]. However, in order to have the canonical vectors in Θs (which contains only sequences of the form {gi(f)}∞i = 1), we assume the existence of a biorthogonal sequence [formula], which restricts us to the cases when [formula] is a Schauder basis for Xs. Note that when Xs is reflexive, [formula] is a Schauder basis of Xs if and only if its biorthogonal sequence [formula] is a Schauder basis of X*s [\cite=Heil]. This restricts us to the use of sequences [formula], which are Schauder basis. In order to avoid the use of a biorthogonal sequence, in the following subsection we construct larger sequence spaces. Thus, our forthcoming Theorems [\ref=constructone] and [\ref=constructthetas] are related to the cases when [formula] is not necessarily a Schauder basis.

Construction of [formula] - more general case

In the sequel we will use the following notation related to a sequence [formula]:

[formula]

c(n)i:= the i-th coordinate of c(n), [formula].

For the construction in Theorem [\ref=constructthetas] we need the following theorem.

Let [formula] be a solid BK-space, [formula] be a reflexive Banach space and [formula] be a Θ-Bessel sequence for X with bound B  ≤  1 such that [formula], [formula]. For every [formula], denote

[formula]

and define

[formula]

Assume

[formula]

[formula]

Then:

[formula] is a solid BK-space with [formula] and {gi}∞i = 1 is a [formula]-Bessel sequence for X with bound [formula].

If [formula] is a Θ-frame for X, then {gi}∞i = 1 is a [formula]-frame for X.

If [formula] is a Banach frame for X with respect to Θ, then {gi}∞i = 1 is a Banach frame for X with respect to [formula].

[formula] is a CB-space if and only if

[formula]

Proof.   (a) First note that [formula]. For any [formula], gi is not the null functional and hence there exists [formula] such that 1  ≤  |gi(f)|. This implies that the i-th canonical vector ei belongs to [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula]. Since Θ is solid, ([\ref=setm]) implies that

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula]. By (A1), the sequence c + d belongs to [formula]; clearly [formula], [formula]. Thus [formula] is a linear space. In order to prove that [formula] is a norm, let us first note that [formula] This is a consequence of the inequality ([\ref=normnerav]) and the fact that [formula] is a norm. The equality [formula] follows from the fact that

[formula]

For the triangle inequality, fix arbitrary [formula], [formula]. For every [formula] and every [formula], by (A1) we can choose an element [formula] such that [formula]. Then

[formula]

It remains to show that [formula] is complete. Let [formula] be a Cauchy sequence in [formula]. Fix ε > 0. There exists ν0(ε) such that for every [formula], μ  ≥  ν0, ν  ≥  ν0, there exists fμ,ν∈Mcμ  -  cν, such that

[formula]

By ([\ref=normnerav]), [formula], is a Cauchy sequence in Θ and hence there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Let [formula]. Since Θ is BK-space, it follows that cνi  →  ci as ν  →    ∞  . Fix ν  ≥  ν0. We will find an element which belongs to Mc - cν. Since [formula] for every μ  ≥  ν0, the scalar sequence [formula] is bounded and hence it contains a convergent subsequence [formula]; denote its limit by aν. Since X is reflexive and the sequence {fμk,ν}∞k = 1 is norm-bounded, by [\cite=AK] there exists a subsequence {fμkn,ν}∞n = 1 which converges weakly to some element [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

Since for every [formula], [formula], it follows

[formula]

Fix [formula]. For every [formula],

[formula]

and taking limit as n  →    ∞  , we obtain

[formula]

Thus, Fν belongs to Mc - cν. This implies that [formula] and therefore, [formula]. Moreover,

[formula]

This concludes the proof that [formula] is complete.

Since the coordinate functionals are continuous on Θ and [formula], they are continuous on [formula] and thus [formula] is a BK-space. Moreover, the space [formula] is solid. Indeed, let [formula] and [formula] be such that |di|  ≤  |ci|, [formula]. Since Θ is solid, [formula] belongs to Θ. Moreover, [formula]. Thus, [formula] and [formula].

For every [formula], the set M{gi(f)}∞i = 1 contains f and thus [formula]; moreover, [formula]. Therefore, {gi}∞i = 1 is a [formula]-Bessel sequence for X with bound [formula].

(b) Let A be a lower Θ-frame bound for the Θ-frame [formula]. Then

[formula]

which implies that [formula] satisfies the lower [formula]-frame inequality.

(c) Let V:Θ  →  X be a bounded operator such that V({gi(f)}∞i = 1) = f, [formula]. Consider [formula]. For every [formula],

[formula]

which implies that [formula] is bounded on [formula]. Therefore, [formula] is a Banach frame for X with respect to [formula].

(d) That all the canonical vectors belong to [formula], is shown in (a). For [formula], observe that Mc(n)  ⊆  Mc(n + 1), [formula], and hence [formula], [formula].

Assume now that (A2) holds. Let [formula] and ε > 0. By (A2), there exists [formula] such that [formula] and hence [formula] for every n  ≥  k. Therefore, c(n)  →  0 in [formula] as n  →    ∞  , which implies that [formula] in [formula] as n  →    ∞  .

Assume now that [formula] is a CB-space and let [formula]. For every ε > 0 there exists [formula] such that [formula]. This implies that there exists f∈Mc(k) with [formula]. [formula]

In order to show that conditions (A1) and (A2) are not artificial ones, we will prove their validity in a simple case when a frame is obtained from an orthonormal basis of a Hilbert space.

Let (X,〈  ·  ,  ·  〉) be a Hilbert space, [formula] be an orthonormal basis for X and [formula]. Let [formula] be defined by

[formula]

Clearly, [formula] is a Banach frame for X with respect to [formula], which is not a Schauder basis of X. Let [formula] be defined by ([\ref=setm2]). Then [formula] is a CB-space and [formula] is a Banach frame for X with respect to [formula].

Proof.   Let [formula]. Denote

[formula]

Fix f∈Mc and h∈Md. By ([\ref=setm]),

[formula]

Let us find rf,h∈Mc + d such that [formula]. Consider

[formula]

where m: =  max (|c1 + d1|,|c2 + d2|). It is clear that

[formula]

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. By ([\ref=nova]),

[formula]

[formula]

Using the fact that [formula], |ci + di|  ≤  |ci| + |di|, and the solidity of [formula], we obtain that

[formula]

Therefore, (A1) is fulfilled.

Consider now [formula]. Fix ε > 0 and find [formula], k > 1, such that [formula]. Let

[formula]

There exists [formula] such that [formula] Recall,

[formula]

Thus we have

[formula]

which implies that h∈Mc(k). Moreover, [formula] and hence (A2) is fulfilled.

The conclusion now follows from Theorem [\ref=constructone]. [formula]

Let [formula] be a solid BK-space and [formula] be a sequence of reflexive Banach spaces which satisfies ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]). Let [formula] be a Θ-Bessel sequence for X0 with bound B  ≤  1 such that [formula], [formula]. For every [formula] and every [formula], denote

[formula]

and define

[formula]

Consider the following conditions:

[formula]       [formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]  There exists As∈(0,1] such that for every f∈Xs one has

[formula]

Assume that [formula] holds for every [formula]. Then:

[formula] is a sequence of solid BK-spaces with the properties ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx2]) such that {gi|Xs}∞i = 1 is a Θs-Bessel sequence for Xs with bound Bs = 1, [formula].

For any [formula], Θs is a CB-space if and only if [formula] holds.

For any [formula], {gi|Xs}∞i = 1 is a Θs-frame for Xs if and only if [formula] holds.

If [formula] holds with As = 1, then {gi|Xs} is a tight Θs-frame for Xs.

Proof.   (a) Let [formula]. Since [formula] and [formula] is a Θ-Bessel sequence for X0 with bound B, ([\ref=fx2]) implies that [formula] and {gi|Xs}∞i = 1 is a Θ-Bessel sequence for Xs with bound B. Now Proposition [\ref=constructone], applied to X = Xs and {gi|Xs}∞i = 1, implies that Θs is a solid BK-space and {gi|Xs}∞i = 1 is a Θs-Bessel sequence for Xs with bound Bs = 1.

It is clear that Θs + 1  ⊆  Θs and [formula], [formula], because Mcs + 1  ⊆  Mcs and [formula].

For every [formula], the set M{gi(f)}∞i = 1s contains f and thus

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

because [formula] and [formula], [formula].

(b) Validity of the statement follows from Proposition [\ref=constructone], applied to X = Xs and to the Θ-Bessel sequence {gi|Xs}∞i = 1 for Xs.

(c) Let [formula]. If [formula] holds, then

[formula]

Conversely, if {gi|Xs}∞i = 1 is a Θs-frame for Xs with a lower bound As∈(0,1], then for every f∈Xs one has

[formula]

Additionally, if [formula] holds with As = 1, then Bs = 1 implies that {gi|Xs}∞i = 1 is a tight Θs-frame for Xs. [formula]

Direct consequences of Theorem [\ref=constructthetas] are given in the next corollary.

(a) If [formula] and [formula] are satisfied for every [formula], then [formula] is a sequence of solid CB-spaces with the properties ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]) such that {gi|XF}∞i = 1 is an F-Bessel sequence for XF with respect to ΘF.

(b) If [formula], [formula] and [formula] are satisfied for every [formula], then {gi|XF}∞i = 1 is a pre-F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF.

Similarly as in Proposition [\ref=primer1], we show in Proposition [\ref=hilbcor] that conditions [formula] are not artificial. For an illustration of the assumptions of Proposition [\ref=hilbcor], see Example [\ref=herm] with ei = hi - 1 and ai,s  =  (2i  -  1)s, [formula], [formula].

Let (X0,〈  ·  ,  ·  〉0) be a Hilbert space and let [formula] denote an orthonormal basis for X0. For given number sequences {ai,s}∞i = 1, [formula], with 1  ≤  ai,s  ≤  ai,s + 1, [formula], [formula], define

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] be defined by

[formula]

Then [formula] is a sequence of Hilbert spaces, which satisfies ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]); [formula], constructed by ([\ref=mx2]) and ([\ref=ts2]), is a sequence of CB-spaces, which satisfies ([\ref=fx1])-([\ref=fx3]) and {gi|XF}∞i = 1 is a tight pre-F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF.

Proof.   First observe that for given number sequence [formula] with ai  ≥  1, [formula], the space X defined by

[formula]

is a Hilbert space satisfying [formula] and having [formula] as an orthonormal basis. For every [formula], apply this to the sequence {ai,s}∞i = 1 and to the space Xs.

Fix [formula]. The inequalities ai,s  ≤  ai,s + 1, [formula], imply that Xs + 1  ⊆  Xs and thus ([\ref=fx1]) holds. Denote zi,s: = ei / ai,s, [formula]. By definition, we have

[formula]

Thus, for f∈Xs + 1 one has

[formula]

and hence ([\ref=fx2]) holds.

It is clear that [formula], [formula]. Moreover, the linear span of [formula] (which is a subset of XF) is dense in Xs. Therefore, ([\ref=fx3]) also holds.

Let us now show that [formula] is fulfilled. Take [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula]. We know that |ci|  ≤  |gi(f)|, [formula], and

[formula]

which implies that

[formula]

Let

[formula]

It follows from ([\ref=shod]) that

[formula]

is an element of Xs. By ([\ref=econd]) and ([\ref=rfh]), it follows that

[formula]

This implies that rf,h∈Mc + ds. In a similar way as in Proposition [\ref=primer1] we obtain that

[formula]

Let us prove that [formula] holds. Take [formula]. Fix ε > 0 and by ([\ref=shod]), find [formula], k > 1, such that [formula]. Let

[formula]

Since [formula], there exists [formula] such that [formula], [formula], and

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

which implies that h∈Mc(k)s.

Let us now prove that [formula] is fulfilled. Consider [formula] and take arbitrary [formula], i.e. [formula]. Using ([\ref=econd]), we obtain

[formula]

Therefore [formula] holds with As = 1.

Now Corollary [\ref=c1] implies that {gi|XF}∞i = 1 is a tight pre-F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF. [formula]

We finish the paper with the following open problem:

Problem. Find conditions on [formula] and [formula], implying existence of an F-bounded projection from ΘF onto {{gi(f)}∞i = 1  :  f∈XF}, which would imply that [formula] is an F-frame for XF with respect to ΘF.
