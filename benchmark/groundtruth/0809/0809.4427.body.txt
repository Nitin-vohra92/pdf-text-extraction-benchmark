Conformality of a differential with respect to Cheeger-Gromoll type metrics

Introduction and Preliminaries

Generalized metrics of Cheeger-Gromoll type or (p,q)-metrics hp,q, being a generalization of Sasaki metric hS [\cite=Kw] and Cheeger-Gromoll metric hCG [\cite=GK], have been recently introduced by M. Benyounes, E. Loubeau and C. M. Wood in [\cite=BLW] in the context of harmonic sections. In [\cite=BLW1], the same authors showed that the geometry of the tangent bundle equipped with this kind of metric is of independent interest. It is worth noticing that M. I. Munteanu in [\cite=M] investigated independently the geometry of tangent bundle equipped with a certain deformation of Cheeger-Gromoll metric other that in [\cite=BLW]. Yet in [\cite=KW], Sz. Walczak and the first named author considered (p,q)-metrics in the context of Riemannian submersions and Gromov-Hausdorff topology.

In this paper we introduced (p,q,α)-metrics which are more general that (p,q)-metrics. (In contrast to [\cite=BLW] we do not assume that p,q and α are constant). We investigate relations between conformality of a map φ:(M,g)  →  (M',g') between Riemannian manifolds and its differential [formula] between their tangent bundles equipped with (p,q,α)-metric h and (r,s,β)-metric h', respectively.

Interesting enough, there is essential difference between the cases dim M = 2 and dim M  ≥  3.

We prove that in the second case (Theorem [\ref=MR_T1]) Φ is conformal if and only if φ is a homothety and totally geodesic immersion and some special relations between triples (p,q,α) and (r,s,β) hold. In this case Φ is also a homothety with the same dilatation as φ.

However, in the first case it may happen that Φ is conformal, although φ is not a totally geodesic immersion (Theorem [\ref=MR_T2]). Then Φ is no longer a homothety. An example of such a map is given.

Cheeger-Gromoll type metrics

Consider a Riemannian manifold (M,g), and let π:TM  →  M be its tangent bundle. The Levi-Civita connection [formula] of g, gives a natural splitting [formula] of the second tangent bundle [formula], where the vertical distribution V is the kernel of [formula], and the horizontal distribution is the kernel of, so called, connection map K. If X,Z∈TxM then by XvZ we denote the vertical lift of X to the point Z, i.e., XvZ is a tangent vector to the curve t  ↦  Z  +  tX at t = 0. Every A∈TZ(TM) can be uniquely written as A = HA + VA, where HA∈HZ and VA∈VZ denote its horizontal and vertical part respectively. The vertical part of A is given by (KA)vZ.

Recall that K is a smooth [formula]-linear bundle morphism determined by the conditions:

For every Z∈TM, K:TZ(TM)  →  Tπ(Z)M is the canonical isomorphism, i.e., K(XvZ) = X.

For every vector field X on M and every v∈TxM, [formula].

Notice that (K1) and (K2) imply the following properties

For every Riemannian manifold (M',g') and every X,Z∈TxM and every map φ:M  →  M', [formula].

For every curve γ in M and every vector field ξ along γ, [formula].

Let p,q,α be smooth functions on M. Assume q is non-negative and α is positive. Define (p,q,α)-metric h = hp,q,α on TM as follows: For every A,B∈TZ(TM), Z∈TxM,

[formula]

where ωα(Z) = (1 + αg(Z,Z))- 1. Here all functions p,q,α are evaluated at x. For any p,q,α, the Riemannian metric hp,q,α is a special case of a metric considered in [\cite=M]. Notice that if p,q,α are constants and α = 1 then hp,q,α becomes a metric from [\cite=BLW]. In particular, h0,0,1 (resp. h1,1,1) is Sasaki metric hS [\cite=Kw] (resp. Cheeger-Gromoll metric hCG [\cite=GK]).

Conformal mappings and metrics

Recall that a map φ:(M,g)  →  (M',g') between Riemannian manifolds is conformal if [formula] for some positive function λ on M. The function λ is called a dilatation. A conformal mapping with constant dilatation is called a homothety. If dim M  <   dim M' a conformal mapping φ is often called weakly conformal.

Let λ be a strictly positive C∞-function on M, and gλ  =  λg. The Levi-Civita connections [formula] and [formula] of g and gλ are related as follows: [formula] where S = Sg,λM is a symmetric (1,2)-tensor field given by (compare [\cite=Ch], page 64):

[formula]

Suppose φ:M  →  M' is an immersion, e.g., conformal mapping. Then for every x∈M we may choose an open neighbourhood Ux of x such that Lx'  =  φ(Ux) (x' = φ(x)) is a regular submanifold of M'. Let j:Lx'  →  M' be the inclusion map, and let [formula] be the induced metric tensor on Lx'. Moreover, let Π denote the second fundamental form of Lx'. We say that the immersion φ:(M,g)  →  (M',g') is totally geodesic if for every x∈M, Lx' is a totally geodesic submanifold of (M',g'). One can prove the following

Suppose φ:(M,g)  →  (M',g') is a conformal mapping with a dilatation λ. Choose x∈M and put x' = φ(x). Let γ:( - ε,ε)  →  Lx' be a curve in M and ξ be a vector field along γ. Put [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

where S = Sg,λM, and [formula] and [formula] are the Levi-Civita connections of g and [formula] respectively.

Adopt the notations from Lemma [\ref=CM_nable]. Put Z = ξ(0), Z' = ξ'(0), [formula] and [formula]. Suppose that a vector A∈TZ(TM) is tangent to the curve ξ (it is convenient to think of vector fields along curves as of curves in the tangent bundle), i.e., [formula]. Next, let K and K' denote connection maps induced from [formula] and [formula] respectively. Moreover put [formula]. As a direct consequence of Lemma [\ref=CM_nable], the equation [formula] and properties of connection map we get

The vectors K(A) and [formula] are related as follows:

[formula]

In particular, if A is horizontal then [formula]

Let U = Ux and L' = Lx' and let π':TL'  →  L' be a natural projection. Since φ:U  →  L' is a conformal diffeomorphism, so is its inverse. In particular Φ:TU  →  TL' is a diffeomorphism. Therefore we have

Take A'∈TZ'(TL') such that [formula]. Then

[formula]

or equivalently

[formula]

where S' = S,μL' with [formula], and q is the connection map induced from [formula].

Suppose φ:(M,g)  →  (M',g') is a conformal mapping and M is connected. [formula] maps horizontal vectors onto horizontal vectors if and only if φ is a totally geodesic homothety.

(⇒  ) If [formula] maps horizontal vectors onto horizontal vectors then by Lemma [\ref=CM_KK], [formula] vanishes identically. Since [formula] and Π are always orthogonal and a conformal mapping is an immersion it follows that S and Π vanish identically. Applying the definition of S with X = Y = grad  λ, we get that grad  λ is the zero vector field. Consequently, λ is constant and therefore φ is a homothety. Since Π vanishes, φ is totally geodesic.

(⇐) Obvious.

Algebraic lemmas

Suppose two finite dimensional spaces V and W equipped with inner products 〈,〉V and 〈,〉W are given. Let B:V  ×  V  →  W be a symmetric, bilinear form on V. Moreover, let C  ≥  0. Consider a condition

[formula]

for every X,Y,Z∈V. Then, if X,Y are orthogonal

[formula]

Assume that B satisfies the condition [\eqref=SS_AL_E1]. If dim V  ≥  3 then C = 0. In particular, B vanishes.

Suppose that C  ≠  0. Take an orthonormal pair X,Y. Let ξ  =  B(X,X) and ζ  =  B(Y,Y). By [\eqref=SS_AL_E1] we have

[formula]

In particular, ξ  ≠  0 and ζ  ≠  0. Applying [\eqref=SS_AL_E01] we see that

[formula]

Using above and [\eqref=SS_AL_E2] one can obtain that ξ =  - ζ. Next, since dim V  ≥  3 we may find Z∈V such that X,Y,Z is an orthonormal triple. Let η  =  B(Z,Z). Then, by above ξ =  - ζ  =  η =  - ξ, which contradicts the fact that ξ  ≠  0.

Notice that the assumption dim V  ≥  3 is essential. Namely we have

(a) A symmetric bilinear form [formula] satisfies [\eqref=SS_AL_E1] if and only if there exists an angle θ such that

[formula]

where we identify [formula] with [formula]. (b) If dim V = 2 and a non-zero symmetric bilinear form B:V  ×  V  →  W satisfies the condition [\eqref=SS_AL_E1] then there exists a 2-dimensional subspace U of W such that the image of B is equal to U and with respect to orthonormal bases of V and U, B is of the form [\eqref=AL_E].

(a) Elementary exercise. (b) Take an orthonormal basis X,Y of V. Since B  ≠  0, we have C  ≠  0. Consequently, ξ  =  B(X,X), ζ  =  B(Y,Y) and η  =  B(X,Y) are nonzero vectors of W of length [formula]. By [\eqref=SS_AL_E1] we see that 〈ξ,η〉  =  〈ζ,η〉  =  0. Moreover, 〈ξ,ζ〉  =   - C, by [\eqref=SS_AL_E01]. It follows that ξ  =    -  ζ. Consequently, the image U of B is a two-dimensional subspace spanned by ξ,η.

Now taking orthonormal bases of V and U, e.g., X,Y and [formula], we reduce (b) to (a).

Conformality of a differential

In this section all manifolds are connected. Let (M,g) and (M',g') be Riemannian manifolds of dimensions m and m', respectively. We assume that m,m'  ≥  2. Denote by [formula] and [formula] the Levi-Civita connections of g and g', respectively. Equip their tangent bundles π:TM  →  M and π':TM'  →  M' with (p,q,α)-metric h and (r,s,β)-metric h', respectively.

Let φ:M  →  M' and [formula]. Put g = 〈,〉 and g' = 〈,〉'. Denote by |  ·  | and |  ·  |' the norms induced by g and g', respectively. Moreover, denote by [formula] and [formula] the norms induced by h and h', respectively.

In the paper we use the following notation: If φ (resp. Φ) is conformal mapping then its dilatation will be always denoted by λ (resp. Λ).

Technical lemmas

Suppose that φ and Φ are conformal mappings. Then for any Z∈TxM and x' = φ(x),

[formula]

Let X,Z∈TxM. Applying conformality of Φ and (K3) we have: [formula]. Using now the definitions of h and h' and conformality of φ, one can easily get

[formula]

Taking nonzero vector X orthogonal to Z, [\eqref=C13] becomes [\eqref=C11]. Next, let Z  ≠  0. Putting X = Z in [\eqref=C13] and comparing the result with [\eqref=C11] we get [\eqref=C12].

If Φ is conformal then so is φ. Moreover λ(x)  =  Λ(0x), x∈M.

Let x∈M and Z = 0x∈TxM. By (K3) and conformality of Φ, for every X,Y∈TxM

[formula]

Adopt the notation from Section [\ref=SS_CM]. Suppose that φ and Φ are conformal mappings. Then

φ is a homothety.

For every x∈M one of the following conditions holds:

[formula]

If for every x∈M either [\eqref=C2E1] or [\eqref=C2E2] holds then Φ is also a homothety with the dilatation Λ  =  λ. Moreover, φ is totally geodesic.

If [\eqref=C2E3] or [\eqref=C2E4] holds globally then for every v,w,Z∈TxM

[formula]

where C = λ(α(x) - λβ(x'))  ≠  0 in the case [\eqref=C2E3], and C = λα(x)  ≠  0 in the case [\eqref=C2E4]. In particular, φ is not totally geodesic.

Assume that v  ≠  0. Take vectors A∈TZ(TM) and A'∈TZ'(TL') as in Lemma [\ref=CM_nable] and Corollary [\ref=CM_cor_-1]. Moreover we may assume that A and A' are horizontal with respect to [formula] and [formula], respectively, i.e., K(A) = 0 and q(A') = 0.

Put U = Ux and L' = Lx'. Let J:TL'  →  TM' be the inclusion map. Put [formula]. Since φ:(U,g)  →  (L',) and Φ:(TU,h)  →  (TL,) are conformal diffeomorphisms, so are φ- 1:(L',)  →  (U,g) and Φ- 1:(TL',)  →  (TU,h). Dilatations of φ- 1 and Φ- 1 are equal to [formula] and [formula], respectively. Thus we have

[formula]

Put for a while S = S(v,Z), S' = S'(v',Z') and Π' = Π(v',Z'). Since [formula], [formula], K(A) = 0, K'(A') = q(A') + Π' = Π' and Z' is orthogonal to Π', we have

[formula]

Next applying Lemma [\ref=CM_nable] and Corollary [\ref=CM_cor_-1], the equalities [formula] and [formula], and the fact that [formula] is orthogonal to Π' we get

[formula]

Combining now above equalities and using the definitions of μ and [formula] we get

[formula]

where λ  =  λ(x) and Λ  =  Λ(Z). Multiplying equations [\eqref=TL_E1] and [\eqref=TL_E2] side by side we conclude that

[formula]

Since v  ≠  0, S(v,Z) = 0. Since x∈M, v,Z∈TxM were arbitrary the tensor field S vanishes identically. Therefore, λ is a constant function and thus φ is a homothety. Hence (a) is proved.

Substituting S = 0 in [\eqref=TL_E1] we get

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=C1] we get

[formula]

Using the facts that the map [formula] is non negative and symmetric with respect to v,Z, we conclude (b).

If [\eqref=C2E1] or [\eqref=C2E2] holds then by [\eqref=C11] it follows that Λ  =  λ. Moreover, in these cases [\eqref=C2EP] becomes [formula]. This proves (C).

If [\eqref=C2E3] or [\eqref=C2E4] holds then it is an elementary computation to check that Π satisfies [\eqref=C2E5], proving (d).

Suppose that dim M  ≥  3 or dim M'  ≤   dim M + 1. Then under the assumptions of Lemma [\ref=C2] we have: φ is totally geodesic homothety, Φ is a homothety and its dilatation Λ is equal to λ.

It suffices to show that under the assumptions the conditions [\eqref=C2E3] and [\eqref=C2E4] cannot hold. Then the assertion follows from Lemma [\ref=C2] (a) and (c). Suppose that [\eqref=C2E3] or [\eqref=C2E4] holds. Then by Lemma [\ref=C2] (d) it follows that the symmetric bilinear form B:TxM  ×  TxM  →  Tx'M' given by [formula] satisfies the condition [\eqref=SS_AL_E1] with C  ≠  0. If dim M  ≥  3 then we have a contradiction with Lemma [\ref=Lem_AL], if dim M'  ≤   dim M + 1 then we have a contradiction with Lemma [\ref=SS_AL_PRP].

Main results

We begin with some definitions. Suppose [formula] is a submanifold of a Riemannian manifold (M',g'). Suppose that a real-valued non-negative function C on [formula] is given. We say that [formula] is optimal with a coefficient C if for every x'∈ the second fundamental form Π of [formula] at x' satisfies [\eqref=SS_AL_E1] with the constant C(x') that is

[formula]

In particular, every totally geodesic submanifold is optimal with the coefficient 0. By Lemma [\ref=Lem_AL] and Lemma [\ref=SS_AL_PRP] it follows that if dim   ≥  3 or codim    ≤  1 then each optimal submanifold is totally geodesic.

Suppose dim  = 2. Denote by κ' and [formula] the sectional curvatures of M' and [formula], and let σ  =  Tx'. If [formula] is optimal submanifold of M' with a coefficient C then [formula] is minimal submanifold of M' and (σ)  =  κ'(σ)  -  2C(x'). In particular, if C is constant and M' is a space of constant curvature then so is [formula].

The fact that [formula] is minimal follows immediately from Lemma [\ref=SS_AL_PRP]: it suffices to calculate the trace of the bilinear form given by [\eqref=AL_E]. The second statement follows from [\eqref=SS_AL_E1], [\eqref=SS_AL_E01] and the Gauss Equation.

Suppose now that two Riemannian manifolds (M,g) and (M',g') are given and dim M  ≤   dim M'. Equip their tangent bundles TM and TM' with (p,q,α)-metric h and (r,s,β)-metric h' respectively. Suppose next that the functions p,q,r,s,α,β are constant, and φ:M  →  M' is an imbedding (injective immersion). Let   =  φ(M).

Let dim M  ≥  3 or dim M'  ≤   dim M + 1.

Suppose that φ is a conformal mapping with a dilatation λ. Then [formula] is conformal if and only if [formula], φ is a homothety, [formula] is totally geodesic and for every x∈M (x' = φ(x)) one of the conditions [\eqref=C2E1] or [\eqref=C2E2] holds.

If Φ is a conformal mapping then φ and Φ are homotheties and Λ  =  λ.

Let dim M  =  2 and dim M'  ≥   dim M + 2.

Suppose that φ is a conformal mapping with a dilatation λ. Then [formula] is conformal if and only if φ is a homothety, [formula], [formula] is optimal with the coefficient

[formula]

and for every x∈M (x' = φ(x)) one of the properties [\eqref=C2E1]-[\eqref=C2E4] is satisfied.

Suppose Φ is a conformal mapping. Then φ a homothety and

If for every x∈M one of the conditions [\eqref=C2E1] or [\eqref=C2E2] holds then Φ is also a homothety and Λ  =  λ.

If one of the conditions [\eqref=C2E3] or [\eqref=C2E4] holds globally then φ is a minimal immersion and for every plane [formula], x∈M, the Gauss curvature κ(σ) of M is

[formula]

where κ'(σ) is the Gauss curvature of M'. Moreover, Φ is not a homothety. Its dilatation Λ is

[formula]

(I, III ⇒  ) Suppose φ and Φ are conformal mappings. By Lemma [\ref=C2], φ is a homothety and for every x∈M (x' = φ(x)) one of the conditions [\eqref=C2E1]-[\eqref=C2E4] holds. By Lemma [\ref=C1], [formula]. If dim M  ≥  3 or dim M'  ≤   dim M + 1, by Lemma [\ref=C2] (d) and Lemma [\ref=Lem_CC2] conditons [\eqref=C2E3] and [\eqref=C2E4] cannot hold. Therefore Lemma [\ref=C2] (c) implies that [formula] is totally geodesic. Moreover, if [\eqref=C2E3] or [\eqref=C2E4] is satisfied then by Lemma [\ref=C2] (d) and Remark [\ref=MR_R1], [formula] is optimal with the coefficient [formula].

(I, III ⇐) Taking horizontal (resp. vertical) A∈TZTM, computing [formula] and applying relations between p,q,r,s,α,β and λ one can conclude that Φ is conformal.

(II) Suppose Φ is conformal. By Lemma [\ref=C3], φ is also conformal. Therefore (I) and Lemma [\ref=C1] imply that Φ and φ are homotheties and Λ  =  λ.

(IV) As above we conclude that φ is conformal.

(IV1) It is a consequence of Lemma [\ref=C2] (c).

(IV2) Suppose for every x∈M one of the conditions [\eqref=C2E3] or [\eqref=C2E4] holds. By Proposition [\ref=PRP_OPT], (I) and the fact that the curvature under the action of a homothety with dilatation λ is scaled by 1 / λ, φ is a minimal immersion and [\eqref=MR_T2_cur] holds. Conditions [\eqref=C2E3], [\eqref=C2E4] and equation [\eqref=C11] imply [\eqref=MR_T2_E1].

As a direct consequence of of Theorem [\ref=MR_T1] we obtain

Suppose dim M  ≥  3 or dim M'  ≤   dim M + 1. Let φ:(M,g)  →  (M',g') be an imbedding. Then we have:

Φ:(TM,hS)  →  (TM',h'S) is conformal if and only if φ is totally geodesic homothety.

Φ:(TM,hCG)  →  (TM',h'CG) is conformal if and only if φ is totally geodesic isometric imbedding.

Φ:(TM,hCG)  →  (TM',h'S) is never conformal.

An example to Theorem [\ref=MR_T2]

It is important to show that there is essential difference between Theorems [\ref=MR_T1] and [\ref=MR_T2]. To do this we give an example of 2-dimensional manifold M, 4-dimensional manifold M' and an immersion φ:M  →  M' such that   =  φ(M) is optimal but not totally geodesic.

Let Σd(ρ) denote Euclidean d-dimensional sphere of radius ρ centred at the origin in [formula]. Recall (see [\cite=Ch], Chapter 4 § 5 page 139) that the second standard immersion of Σ2(1) it is a map [formula] defined as follows: Consider harmonic homogeneous polynomials ui, [formula], in [formula] given by

[formula]

and let [formula]. We define φ to be the restriction u|Σ2(1). Then [formula] is an isometric immersion (but not imbedding). Nevertheless,   =  φ(Σ2(1)) is a minimal submanifold of [formula]. We show that [formula] is optimal with the constant coefficient C = 1.

Suppose (M,g) is a Riemannian manifold and [formula]. Assume that the image  = u(M) is contained in Σ  =  Σd(ρ) and u:M  →  Σ is an imbedding. Denote by Π and [formula] the second fundamental form of [formula] in Σ and [formula] in [formula], respectively. Then for every x'∈Σ and for every basis (ei) of Tx'

[formula]

where 〈,〉 is the canonical inner product in [formula].

Elementary exercise.

If φ is the second standard immersion then the submanifold   =  φ(Σ2(1)) is optimal with the constant coefficient C = 1.

Let M = Σ2(1) and [formula]. Adopt the notations from Lemma [\ref=Lem_EXS]. Denote by [formula] the restriction of φ to lower half sphere Σ2-(1). Since φ(Σ2(1)) coincides with the closure of (Σ2-(1)), it suffices to prove that -  =  (Σ2-(1)) is optimal with the coefficient one.

Let f be the stereographic projection [formula] from the north pole. Put [formula]. Fix x' = ψ- 1(t), where [formula], |t| < 1. Let ei = (∂  /  ∂ψi)(x'). Put t2 = t21 + t22 and t4  =  (t2)2. Since φ is an isometric immersion and f is the stereographic projection we have

[formula]

where δij is the Kronecker symbol. In the light of Lemma [\ref=Lem_EXS] (with [formula]), to finish the proof it suffices to show that

[formula]

After elementary but laborious calculations we get

[formula]

and

[formula]

and

[formula]

Now one can check that [\eqref=SS_EX_PRPE1] holds.

Now let [formula] denote the real 2-dimensional projective space. We treat [formula] as a Riemannian manifold whose metric g is given by the standard two-sheeted covering map [formula]. Put (x̂)  =  φ(x) if x̂  =  π̂(x). Since φ(x) = φ( - x), the map [formula] is well defined. Moreover, [formula] is an imbedding. It is called the first standard imbedding of [formula] into [formula].

Take constants q,α > 0. Suppose Cheeger-Gromoll type metrics h and h' on [formula] and [formula] are given. If

(1) h = h1,q,α + 1 and h' = h'1,q,α, or

(2) h = h1,q,1 and h' = h'0,q,1 then [formula] is a conformal mapping, but not a homothety. Its dilatation is Λ(Z) = (1 + (α + 1)g(Z,Z)) / (1  +  αg(Z,Z)) in the case of (1) and Λ(Z)  =  1 + g(Z,Z) in the case of (2).
