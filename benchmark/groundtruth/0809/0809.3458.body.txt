Introduction

Let pk denote the k-th prime and for k  >  1,

[formula]

Concerning d(pk), Harald Cramér conjectured that there exists a positive real number M such that

[formula]

for all k  ≥  1.

Cramér himself showed [\cite=Granville] that

[formula]

for all but at most [formula] primes ≤  x.

We denote the number of primes less than or equal to a positive real number x with π(x). In this paper, we prove the following theorem, which supports Cramér's conjecture.

Let x be any positive real number and Nε(x) the number of primes ≤  x which satisfy the inequality

[formula]

where ε  >  0 is arbitrary and fixed. Then we have

[formula]

Note that the function for the upper bound of d(pk) in Theorem [\ref=main] is ( log pk)2, while that in Cramér's conjecture is ( log pk  -  1)2; the function is evaluated at the smaller prime of the gap in Cramér's conjecture. Nevertheless, the prime number theorem implies that

[formula]

so replacing the function for the upper bound in Cramér's conjecture by ( log pk)2 does not change the statement of the conjecture essentially.

In proving Theorem [\ref=main], the following lemmas are used.

[\cite=Apostol] For any arithmetical function a(n) let

[formula]

where A(x)  =  0 if x  <  1. Assume that f has a continuous derivative on the interval

[formula]

[\cite=Granville] For all k  ≥  1, we have

[formula]

Proof of Theorem 1

In this section, we give a proof of Theorem [\ref=main].

Define

[formula]

We begin by an elementary analysis of the partial sums

[formula]

For all positive real numbers t  ≥  2, if pk  -  1  ≤  t  ≤  pk (k  ≥  2) then we have

[formula]

It is easy to see that for [formula], we have

[formula]

Hence, for N  ≥  2 we have

[formula]

If t satisfies pN  -  1  <  t  <  pN (N  ≥  2), then the first partial sums of Q is constant, and the second ones decrease by 1 as t increases by 1. The lemma now follows from ([\ref=zero]).

Using all the preliminary lemmas above, Theorem [\ref=main] is proved as follows. Let ε  >  0 be arbitrary.

We define a function δε(x) such that

[formula]

It is plain that 0  <  δε(x)  <  1. We show that

[formula]

thereby proving Theorem [\ref=main].

By the definition of Nε(x), there are (1  -  δε(x))π(x) primes which are ≤  x and satisfy the inequality

[formula]

This is equivalent to stating the following:

[formula]

At this point, we pay our attention to the partial sums

[formula]

Define

[formula]

In Lemma [\ref=pre1], we choose

[formula]

and obtain

[formula]

By Lemmas [\ref=pre4] and [\ref=2.1], it is plain that the limit of the right side of ([\ref=Abel1]) as x  →    ∞   exists. Since

[formula]

it follows from ([\ref=Abel1]) that

[formula]

Now, given ε and x  >  0, let Sε(x) be the set of all primes ≤  x which satisfy the last inequality in ([\ref=density2]), |Sε(x)| the number of elements in Sε(x), and

[formula]

Choosing

[formula]

in Lemma [\ref=pre1], we have for each w  ≤  x

[formula]

where

[formula]

and 0  ≤  ξε,x(w)  ≤  |Sε(x)| for w  ≤  x. In particular, when w  =  x, we have

[formula]

But since

[formula]

it is plain that for each arbitrary ε  >  0, there exists tε  >  0 such that q'(ε)(t)  <  0 for all t  ≥  tε. This in turn implies that for each arbitrary ε  >  0, with

[formula]

there exists a positive real number Mε, which depends only on ε, such that the integral in ([\ref=Abel2]) satisfies

[formula]

for all x  ≥  2.

With ([\ref=bound]), the inequality ([\ref=Abel2]) becomes

[formula]

Furthermore, by ([\ref=density2]), we have |Sε(x)|  =  δε(x)π(x), and so ([\ref=Abel3]) gives

[formula]

Finally, by ([\ref=key]) and the prime number theorem

[formula]

letting x  →    ∞  , the inequality ([\ref=Abel4]) becomes

[formula]

by which ([\ref=zeroresult]) follows immediately. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=main].

Distribution of squarefree numbers

We note the following theorem, which is a corollary to the proof of Theorem [\ref=main] in the previous section.

Let {ak} be the sequence of squarefree numbers,

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let ε  >  0 be arbitrary and Nε(x) the number of squarefree numbers ≤  x which satisfy the inequality

[formula]

for some positive constant M. Then we have

[formula]

We recall that [\cite=Hardy]

[formula]

for some constant A. By ([\ref=ee]), it is easy to see that

[formula]

If we recall how Lemma [\ref=2.1] was derived with Lemma [\ref=pre4], it is plain that

[formula]

The rest of the proof follows a similar pattern. In particular, we note the following analogues:

the analogue of ([\ref=key]) is

[formula]

the analogue of Q(t) is R(t);

the analogue of qε(t) is the function [formula].

From Theorem [\ref=general], one may wonder if the exact order of d(ak) is O( log ak).
