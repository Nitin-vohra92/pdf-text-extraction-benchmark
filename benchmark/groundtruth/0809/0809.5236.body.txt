What is the maximum rate at which entropy of a string can increase?

The paradox of information loss in black hole physics [\cite=s1] is essentially related to the flow of information or, taking into account the fundamental equivalence relation between information and entropy, information and entropy. Its resolution requires a kinematic description of matter at high energies which differs radically from the one offered by conventional quantum field theory. String theory is widely believed to provide such a description. In a series of insightful papers, Susskind showed [\cite=s2] [\cite=s3] that a string falling toward a black hole spreads linearly over the stretched horizon. But during the process string interactions become important so that the process turns out to be nonperturbative [\cite=s1]. A calculation of such processes is beyond the current technology of string theory. Susskind suggested that in this case a string should spread much more rapidly - exponentially [\cite=s3]. Obviously that during the process the entropy of string should change. But Susskind did not consider the string entropy and present a calculation of its change. In this paper I find the entropy of spreading string with the help of random-walk models. As is well known, quantum theory, and, in particular, quantum information theory impose constraints on the information/entropy flow. String theory pretends to be a consistent quantum theory of matter. But it is unclear whether string theory satisfies quantum limits to the entropy flow when a string spreads exponentially. To answer the question I find the maximum rate allowed by quantum theory at which the entropy of a string can increase when it spreads over the stretched horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole.

Before we start out discussing the problem, I repeat, for the convenience of the reader, some well-known facts from [\cite=s1] concerning the behavior of stringy matter near the horizon without proofs, thus making our exposition self-contained. It is well established that, from the point of view of an external observer, the classical physics of a quasistationary black hole can be described in terms of a "stretched horizon" which is a "membrane" - a timelike surface placed near the event horizon and endowed with certain mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties [\cite=tor]. The exact distance of this membrane above the event horizon is somewhat arbitrary. In the context of string theory - the subject of our research, the stretched horizon is most naturally thought of as lying at the string scale ls above the event horizon. In what follows we will deal with this conception (sometimes referred to simply as horizon). An important fact is that the size and shape of a string are sensitive to the time resolution. It is a smearing time over which the internal motions of the string are averaged. Susskind showed [\cite=s2] that zero-point fluctuations of a string make the size of the string depend on a time resolution; the shorter the time over which the oscillations of a string are averaged the larger its spatial extent. This effect is closely related to the well-known Regge behavior of string scattering amplitudes [\cite=s2]. More precisely, Susskind found that in the weak coupling limit the mean squared radii of the string in the transverse and longitudinal directions in Planck units are [formula] and [formula], respectively. Similar calculations can be performed for the total length of the string, and Susskind found that L = ls  /  τres. Now consider a string falling toward a black hole. As is well known [\cite=s1], the proper time in the frame of the string τ and the Schwarzschild time of an external observer t are related through τ  ~   exp ( -  t  /  2Rg) due to the redshift factor. This means that the transverse size of the string will increase linearly:

[formula]

while its longitudinal size and total length - exponentially:

[formula]

[formula]

But the longitudinal growth ([\ref=st1]) is rapidly canceled by the Lorentz longitudinal contraction. Thus the string approaching the horizon spreads only in the transverse directions (in this connection the subscript "[formula]" at the the mean squared radius of the string will be replaced by the "s", that means "string", henceforward). Note that as Mezhlumian, Peet and Thorlacius showed [\cite=mez], the transverse spreading can be also described as a branching diffusion of wee string bits.

How does the entropy of string change?- Unfortunately Susskind did not consider the string entropy and give a calculation of its change. To answer the question I propose to use the random-walk model. As has been stated above, Susskind obtained his results in the framework of weakly coupled string theory. It turns out that behavior of a string in this regime is very precisely described in terms of the random-walk model [\cite=zwie], [\cite=thor]. So we can imagine a string as simply built by joining together bits of string, each of which is of length ls. Suppose that the total length of the string is L and each string bit can point in any of n possible directions. Then the number of bits is N = L / ls and the number of states of the string is

[formula]

For notational simplicity the factor ln n will be omitted henceforward (there is no loss of generality in doing so because we can always redefine g, lS and L). We can also define the mean squared radius of the string 〈R2s〉  =  Lls. Then

[formula]

and the entropy of the string is

[formula]

Now, substituting ([\ref=str5]) in ([\ref=str2]), we obtain

[formula]

So the entropy is

[formula]

and the entropy rate

[formula]

Thus during the spreading the entropy of string increases. It is obvious from the thermodynamical point of view: the spreading effect is a result of heat exchange between a black hole and a string. Since the temperature of the black hole radiation depends on the radial position, T(r) = TH  /  χ, where TH is the Hawking temperature, TH = 1 / 4πRg, and χ is the the redshift factor, χ = (1 - Rg / r)1 / 2, it follows that from the viewpoint of the external observer the string falls into an increasingly hot region. So there is a flow of heat from the black hole to the string. Thus the string should "melt" and spread throughout the horizon. Obviously during this process the phase volume and entropy of string increase. Susskind demonstrated the spreading effect for a fundamental string. It is widely believed, however, that it is not a peculiar feature of a special (still hypothetical) kind of matter. Susskind suggested that in the framework of the so-called infrared/ultraviolet connection [\cite=s1] it is a general property of all matter at energies above the Planck scale.

From ([\ref=str6]) we have found the entropy of string in terms of the mean squared radius or area. According to ([\ref=str1]) we can also do it in terms of the total length. But in this case

[formula]

and for the string entropy we obtain a different result:

[formula]

So the relations ([\ref=str3]) are not satisfied. The point is, as noted by Susskind himself [\cite=s3], that the linear growth of area ([\ref=str5]) was obtained in the framework of free string theory. It does not take into account such a nonperturbative phenomenon as string interactions. The exponential growth of string length and linear growth of area imply that the transverse density of string should increase. When the density becomes of order 1 / G, the area density of horizon entropy, interactions become important. But the precise calculation of the spreading effect in the nonperturbative regime is beyond the current technology of string theory. To prevent the density from increasing beyond 1 / G, Susskind suggested [\cite=s3] that the nonperturbative effects must be such that the string bits become repulsive. This will produce an outward pressure that spreads the string bits much more rapidly than the linear growth in the free theory; as a result, a true growth must be exponential:

[formula]

(at the same time the total length retains its form ([\ref=st2])). It has been known for a long time that a classical charged particle spreads exponentially on the stretched horizon [\cite=tor]. So it is reasonable that these growth patterns (classical and stringy) are a match. That is, ([\ref=exp]) is the only reasonable assumption which provides this match. Now the entropy expressed in terms of the length and area has the same form and the relations ([\ref=str3]) are satisfied. Thus for the entropy rate we obtain

[formula]

It seems however that this is a comparatively large rate. Perhaps the point is that we have used the formulas of the simple random-walk model which is valid only in the framework of the free string theory? So we are forced to use more suitable models. Since the string bits become repulsive, this effect can be accounted for by imposing the condition that two bits cannot occupy the same site. In polymer physics this type of condition is called the "excluded volume effect" [\cite=gen]. If we model a string as a connected path on the stretched horizon, the excluded volume effect will be correspondent to the condition that the path cannot pass through any sites that have been traversed previously. In mathematics this is called a "self-avoiding walk" [\cite=walk]. So our simple model should be replaced by the model of self-avoiding walks. At first sight it seems that the repulsive interactions will impose constraints on the total number of string states and the huge entropy rate ([\ref=rate2]) should considerably reduce. It turns out that this is not the case. The mathematical properties of simple random walks are trivial, but the mathematical properties of self-avoiding walks are complex. The conjectured asymptotic number of the self-avoiding walks of N steps is [\cite=gen] [\cite=walk]:

[formula]

The first factor ñN is reminiscent of the nN in ([\ref=str1]), but ñ is somewhat smaller than n; the exact value of ñ is not known for the hypercubic lattice in any dimensions ≥  2, although for the honeycomb lattice in two dimensions there is nonrigorous evidence that [formula]. The exponent [formula]. So, despite string interactions, the leading significant term of the total number of allowed string states retains its previous form ([\ref=str6]). Thus the entropy rate is really ([\ref=rate2]). String theory pretends to be a consistent quantum theory of matter. But we do not know whether the rate ([\ref=rate2]) satisfies quantum limits to the entropy flow.

Quantum limits to the entropy rate.- As mentioned in the beginning quantum information theory imposes quantum limits to the information/entropy flow. The Bekenstein-Bremermann limit [\cite=bre], [\cite=bek] is one of the most important limits of just the same kind. In its original form it sets an upper bound on the rate at which information I may be transmitted by a signal with a certain amount of energy ΔE,

[formula]

(where the dot, as is customary in information theory, denotes differentiation with respect to t and the Planck constant is written explicitly to emphasize the quantum nature of the bound). Now I want to use it to check the conclusion of string theory ([\ref=rate2]). For this purpose let us rewrite the bound ([\ref=inf1]) in terms of entropy. According to the fundamental equivalence relation between information and entropy, ([\ref=inf1]) can be viewed as an upper bound on the rate of entropy flow in a system

[formula]

Taking into account the second law of thermodynamics we obtain

[formula]

where T and ΔS are the system's temperature and entropy change, respectively. In this form it can be immediately applied to a spreading string. We should, however, emphasize here the following. The spreading process begins to occur when the string reaches the horizon at a distance of order of the string scale ls from the horizon in a thin layer ~  ls. So it may seem that the system's temperature should be determined by the Hagedorn temperature, THagedorn  =  1 / 2πls. But for an external observer it becomes the Hawking temperature due to the gravitational redshift: since χ = (1 - Rg / r)1 / 2  ≈  ls / 2Rg at the proper distance ls from the horizon, TH  =  χTHagedorn. The entropy is not redshifted because it is an invariant. So for the exponential spreading ([\ref=entrop]) we get

[formula]

Comparing it with ([\ref=rate2]) expressed in terms of the Hawking temperature with the explicitly written Planck constant TH  =  πRg, we conclude that the rate ([\ref=rate2]) satisfies the bound ([\ref=inf3]). More precisely the rate ([\ref=rate2]) saturates the bound ([\ref=inf3]). Thus ([\ref=rate2]) is the maximum rate allowed by quantum theory at which the entropy of a string can spread over the horizon.

Before now we have been ignoring the concept of a communication channel: the Bekenstein-Bremermann limit does not use this concept explicitly. But it is one of the most important concepts of information theory. A communication channel is understood to be a complete set of unidirectionally propagating modes of some fields, with the modes enumerated by a single parameter [\cite=pen]. Pendry proposed a limit to information/entropy flow which is essentially based on the concept of a communication channel [\cite=pen]. According to Pendry [\cite=pen], the maximum rate at which information and entropy can flow in a channel is only determined by the system's temperature T:

[formula]

(for a fermion channel it is reduced by a factor [formula]). It can be immediately applied to the spreading process. But it is written for one channel. To apply Pendry's limit to the spreading process we should determine the real number of channels for a string. As mentioned above, the number of channels is determined by the number of modes; moreover each of the possible polarization states can be used as a separate channel. Pendry showed [\cite=pen] that communication systems operate on a finite number of easily identified channels to each of which the bound ([\ref=pen1]) separately applies. For example, consider a flow of entropy conducted by phonons in an insulating crystal [\cite=pen]. In this case the number of channels is given by 3nANc, where nA is the number of atoms per unit cell and Nc is the number of unit two-dimensional cells of the crystal lattice projected onto the plane perpendicular to the direction of flow. In our model a string with a length L has 3(2L / ls) modes (taking account three possible polarizations). By additivity the total entropy rate equals that of one channel ([\ref=pen1]) multiplied by the number of channels. Then taking into account ([\ref=str3]) we obtain

[formula]

This is a quantum bound on the entropy flow expressed in terms of the channel. It has the same form as the bound ([\ref=inf3]) obtained with the help of the Bekenstein-Bremermann limit. Obviously the rate ([\ref=rate2]) complies the bound ([\ref=rate4]). Note that as Pendry showed [\cite=pen], present communication systems for transporting information are very far from the quantum limit ([\ref=rate4]). This is also true for the entropy flow in any physical process in a laboratory. By contrast, the rate ([\ref=rate2]) saturates the bound ([\ref=rate4]).

The maximum rate at which the black hole entropy can increase.- Since the area of the horizon A is finite, it follows from ([\ref=exp]) that a string spreads over the entire horizon in a finite time tspread  =  2Rg ln (A / l2P) [\cite=s3]. At this time the number of states of the string becomes cN  ~   exp (R2g / l2P) and the entropy of the string reaches that of the black hole,

[formula]

According to Susskind [\cite=s3], at the time tspread the string completely covers the entire horizon and can no longer expand due to the nonperturbative effects. The spreading ends and only a new falling string or any other perturbation can start it again. The next string falling toward the horizon interacts with a previous one lying on the horizon in such a way that the formation of a single (new) string is thermodynamically favored, etc [\cite=s1]. So the stretched horizon is a single string made out of all strings whenever fallen into it. From the string theory point of view, a black hole is nothing but a single string lying on the sphere of the radius Rg. Since the spreading effect takes place on a short time scale compared to the black hole lifetime ~  R3g, Susskind [\cite=s3] restricted himself to a static metric. But since a black hole absorbs a string, its gravitational radius must increase. According to the teleological nature of the event horizon [\cite=tor], before a fall of the next string, the gravitational radius and the horizon area increase like exp (t  /  2Rg). The same exponential growth governs the spreading of a classical perturbation on the stretched horizon. This means that the spreading effect takes place. As a result the black hole entropy increases with the rate

[formula]

Its form coincides with that of the string ([\ref=rate2]) as expected in a consistent theory. The rate saturates the quantum bound ([\ref=rate4]). But at the time tspread the total length of string is L = A / lP and the number of channels becomes equal to the number of cells with area ~  l2P on the horizon, A / l2P, up to a coefficient of the order of unity. This agrees with a result of Pendry. Pendry showed [\cite=pen] that for a system enclosed within a surface of finite area A the number of channels is proportional to A. On the other hand, our result implies a limit to the number of channels that can fit into the channel cross section A. It agrees with a result of Lloyd, Giovannetti, and Maccone [\cite=LGM], who proceeding from a quite different problem found that the maximum number of channels must be less than A / 4l2P (our result implies a bound which is four times larger). Note also that the rate ([\ref=rate5]) can be viewed as follows. By definition, the entropy rate is S / τ, where τ is the characteristic time of a system. Then, since for a black hole τ  ~  Rg, we obtain at once dSbh / dt = Sbh / Rg. But this is nothing else than Lloyd's limit [\cite=llo]. According to Lloyd, this is the maximum rate at which the entropy can be moved in and out of a system with size Rg and entropy S (attained by taking all the entropy S in the system and moving it outward at the speed of light). This has something in common with the observation that the spreading rate ([\ref=exp]) is exactly the fastest rate consistent with causality [\cite=s3]. Thus black holes are the most extreme objects in nature realizing the maximum possible entropy flow allowed by quantum theory and relativity.

Conclusions.-In this paper we modeled a string spreading exponentially over the stretched horizon by a self-avoiding walk. In the framework of this model we found the string entropy and rate at which it spreads, dSs / dt = 2πSsTH. We applied two different quantum limits (Bekenstein-Bremermann and Pendry's) to the rate leading to the same conclusion: this is the maximum rate allowed by quantum theory.
