Second symmetric powers of chain complexes

Introduction

Multilinear constructions like tensor products and symmetric powers are important tools for studying modules over commutative rings. In recent years, these notions have been extended to the realm of chain complexes of R-modules. (Consult Section [\ref=sec01] for background information on complexes.) For instance, Buchsbaum and Eisenbud's description [\cite=buchsbaum:asffr] of the minimal free resolutions of Gorenstein ideals of grade 3 uses the second symmetric power of a certain free resolution.

In this paper, we investigate Buchsbaum and Eisenbud's second symmetric power functor: for a chain complex X of modules over a commutative ring R, we set [formula] where Y is the graded submodule generated by all elements of the form [formula] and Z is the graded submodule generated by all elements of the form [formula] where x has odd degree.

Our main result is the following version of a result of Avramov, Buchweitz and ega [\cite=avramov:edcrcvct] for complexes. It is motivated by our work in [\cite=frankild:rbsc] extending the results of [\cite=avramov:edcrcvct]. Note that [formula] does not appear in the statement of Theorem [\ref=intthmC]; however, it is the key tool for the proof, given in [\ref=thmCpf].

Much of this paper is devoted to statements and proofs of results from the folklore of this subject. Section [\ref=sec02] contains basic properties of [formula], most of which are motivated by the behavior of tensor products of complexes and the properties of symmetric powers of modules. This section ends with an explicit description of the modules occuring in [formula]; see Theorem [\ref=betti01]. Section [\ref=sec03] examines the homological properties of [formula], and includes the proof of Thoerem [\ref=intthmC]. The paper concludes with Section [\ref=sec05], which is devoted to explicit computations.

Complexes

Throughout this paper R and S are commutative rings with identity. The term "module" is short for "unital module".

This section consists of definitions, notation and background information for use in the remainder of the paper.

An R-complex is a sequence of R-module homomorphisms

[formula]

such that ∂Xn - 1∂Xn = 0 for each integer n. A complex X is degreewise-finite if each Xn is finitely generated; it is bounded-below if Xn = 0 for n  ≪  0.

The nth homology module of X is [formula]. The infimum of X is [formula], and the large support of X is

[formula]

For each x∈Xn, we set |x|: = n. An R-complex X is homologically degreewise-finite if [formula] is finitely generated for each n; it is homologically finite if the R-module [formula] is finitely generated.

For each integer i, the ith suspension (or shift) of X, denoted [formula], is the complex with [formula] and [formula]. The notation [formula] is short for [formula].

Let X and Y be R-complexes. A morphism from X to Y is a sequence of R-module homomorphisms {fn:Xn  →  Yn} such that fn - 1∂Xn  =  ∂Ynfn for each n. A morphism of complexes α:X  →  Y induces homomorphisms on homology modules [formula], and α is a quasiisomorphism when each [formula] is bijective. Quasiisomorphisms are designated by the symbol "≃".

Let X and Y be R-complexes. Two morphisms f,g:X  →  Y are homotopic if there exists a sequence of homomorphisms s = {sn:Xn  →  Yn + 1} such that fn = gn  +  ∂Yn + 1sn + sn - 1∂Xn for each n; here we say that s is a homotopy from f to g. The morphism f is a homotopy equivalence if there is a morphism h:Y  →  X such that the compositions fh and hf are homotopic to the respective identity morphisms [formula] and [formula], and then f and h are homotopy inverses.

Given two bounded-below complexes P and Q of projective R-modules, we write P≃Q when there is a quasiisomorphism [formula].

The relation ≃ from Definition [\ref=notn03] is an equivalence relation; see [\cite=avramov:dgha] or [\cite=felix:rht] or [\cite=foxby:hacr].

Let P and Q be bounded-below complexes of projective R-modules. Then any quasiisomorphism [formula] is a homotopy equivalence; see [\cite=avramov:dgha] or [\cite=felix:rht]. (Conversely, it is straightforward to show that any homotopy equivalence between R-complexes is a quasiisomorphism.)

Let X be a homologically bounded-below R-complex. A projective (or free) resolution of X is a quasiisomorphism [formula] such that each Pn is projective (or free) and P is bounded-below; the resolution [formula] is degreewise-finite if P is degreewise-finite. We say that X has finite projective dimension when it admits a projective resolution [formula] such that Pn = 0 for n  ≫  0.

Let X be a homologically bounded-below R-complex. Then X has a free resolution [formula] such that Pn = 0 for all n <  inf (X); see [\cite=avramov:dgha] or [\cite=felix:rht] or [\cite=foxby:hacr]. (It follows that Pinf (X)  ≠  0.) If [formula] and [formula] are projective resolutions of X, then there is a homotopy equivalence [formula]; see [\cite=felix:rht] or [\cite=foxby:hacr]. If R is noetherian and X is homologically degreewise-finite, then P may be chosen degreewise-finite; see [\cite=avramov:dgha] or [\cite=foxby:hacr].

Let X be an R-complex that is homologically both bounded-below and degreewise-finite. Assume that R is noetherian and local with maximal ideal [formula]. A projective resolution [formula] is minimal if the complex P is minimal, that is, if [formula] for each n.

Let X be an R-complex that is homologically both bounded-below and degreewise-finite. Assume that R is noetherian and local with maximal ideal [formula]. Then X has a minimal free resolution [formula] such that Pn = 0 for all n <  inf (X); see [\cite=apassov:cdgm] or [\cite=avramov:dgha]. Let [formula] and [formula] be projective resolutions of X. If P is minimal, then there is a bounded-below exact complex P' of projective R-modules such that [formula]; see [\cite=avramov:dgha]. It follows that X has finite projective dimension if and only if every minimal projective resolution of X is bounded. It also follows that, if P and Q are both minimal, then [formula]; see [\cite=avramov:dgha].

Let X and Y be R-complexes. The R-complex [formula] is

[formula]

with nth differential [formula] given on generators by

[formula]

Fix two more R-complexes X',Y' and morphisms f:X  →  X' and g:Y  →  Y'. Define the tensor product [formula] on generators as

[formula]

One checks readily that [formula] is a morphism.

Let P and Q be bounded-below complexes of projective R-modules. If [formula] is a quasiisomorphism, then so are [formula] and [formula]; see [\cite=avramov:dgha] or [\cite=felix:rht] or [\cite=foxby:hacr]. In particular, if [formula] is a quasiisomorphism, then so is [formula]; see [\cite=felix:rht]. This can be used to show the following facts from [\cite=foxby:hacr]:

[formula]

Assume that R is noetherian and that P and Q are homologically degreewise-finite. One can use degreewise-finite projective resolutions of P and Q in order to show that each R-module [formula] is finitely generated; see [\cite=foxby:hacr]. In particular, if R is local, Nakayama's Lemma conspires with the previous display to produce the equality [formula]; see [\cite=foxby:hacr].

The following technical lemma about power series is used in the proofs of Theorem [\ref=symm07''] and Corollary [\ref=s2fpd02].

Let [formula] be a power series with nonnegative integer coefficients, and assume r0  >  0. If either Q(t)2  +  Q( - t2) or Q(t)2  -  Q( - t2) is a non-negative integer, then ri  =  0 for all i > 0. Furthermore,

Q(t)2  +  Q( - t2)  ≠  0;

If Q(t)2  -  Q( - t2)  =  0, then Q(t)  =  1;

If Q(t)2  +  Q( - t2)  =  2, then Q(t) = 1; and

If Q(t)2  -  Q( - t2)  =  2, then Q(t)  =  2.

We begin by showing that rn = 0 for each [formula], by induction on n. The coefficients of Q( - t2) in odd degree are all 0. Hence, the degree 1 coefficient of Q(t)2  ±  Q( - t2) is

[formula]

It follows that r1 = 0, since r0  >  0. Inductively, assume that [formula] and that ri = 0 for each [formula]. Since the degree n + 1 coefficient of QRX( - t2) is either [formula] (when n + 1 is even) or 0 (when n + 1 is odd), the induction hypothesis implies that this coefficient is 0. The degree n + 1 coefficient of Q(t)2  ±  Q( - t2) is

[formula]

and so rn + 1 = 0.

The previous paragraph shows that Q(t) = r0, and so Q(t)2  ±  Q( - t2) = r20  ∓  r0. The conclusions in [\eqref=poinc01item1]-[\eqref=poinc01item4] follow readily, using the assumption r0 > 0.

Definition and Basic Properties of [formula]

We begin this section with the definition of the second symmetric power of a complex. It is modeled on the definition for modules.

Let X be an R-complex and let [formula] be the morphism described on generators by the formula

[formula]

The weak second symmetric power of X is defined as [formula]. The second symmetric power of X is defined as [formula]. For each [formula], let [formula] be the natural surjection.

Here are computations for later use. Section [\ref=sec05] contains more involved examples.

If M is an R-module, then computing [formula] and [formula] as complexes (considering M as a complex concentrated in degree 0) and computing [formula] as a module give the same result. In particular, we have [formula] and [formula].

For [formula] we have [formula]. Hence, the natural tensor-cancellation isomorphism [formula] yields the vertical isomorphisms in the following commutative diagram:

[formula]

It follows that [formula].

By definition, the kernel of the natural map [formula] is generated by [formula]. Since we have [formula], it follows that [formula].

More generally, we have [formula] and [formula] for each integer n. In particular, if 2R  ≠  0, then

[formula]

Contrast this with the behavior of [formula] and [formula] documented in [\eqref=symm04item3].

The following properties are straightforward to verify and will be used frequently in the sequel.

The next two results show that the functors [formula] and [formula] interact well with basic constructions.

Let X be an R-complex.

If φ:R  →  S is a ring homomorphism, then there are isomorphisms of S-complexes [formula] and [formula].

If [formula] is a prime ideal, then there are isomorphisms of [formula]-complexes [formula] and [formula].

[\eqref=loc01item1] The vertical isomorphisms in the following commutative diagram are given by [formula]:

[formula]

This diagram yields the first isomorphism in the next sequence. The second isomorphism is due to the right-exactness of [formula], and the equalities are by definition.

[formula]

By definition, the induced isomorphism [formula] is given by [formula].

Let [formula] be the S-submodule generated by elements of the form [formula] such that [formula] has odd degree. That is, [formula] where [formula] is the natural surjection. It is straightforward to show that Y is generated over S by all elements of the form [formula].

Let [formula] be the R-submodule generated by elements of the form [formula] with x∈X of odd degree. That is, we have an exact sequence of R-morphisms

[formula]

Tensoring with S yields the next exact sequence of S-morphisms

[formula]

and it follows that [formula] is generated over S by all elements of the form [formula] with x∈X of odd degree. Thus, the equality [formula] shows that [formula] induces an S-isomorphism [formula].

[\eqref=loc01item2] This follows from part [\eqref=loc01item1] using the ring homomorphism [formula].

If X and Y are R-complexes, then there are isomorphisms

[formula]

[\eqref=s2sum01a] Tensor-distribution yields the horizontal isomorphisms in the following commutative diagram

[formula]

where [formula] is the tensor-commutativity isomorphism given by [formula]. This diagram yields the first isomorphism in the following sequence while the first equality is by definition

[formula]

The second isomorphism is by elementary linear algebra. For the third isomorphism, using the definition of [formula], we only need to prove [formula] where

[formula]

We set

[formula]

which is a surjective morphism such that [formula]. Thus, there is a well-defined surjective morphism [formula] given by

[formula]

It remains to show that [formula] is injective. To this end, define [formula] by the formula [formula]. It is straightforward to show that δ is a well-defined morphism and that [formula]. It follows that [formula] is injective, hence an isomorphism, as desired.

[\eqref=s2sum01b] The isomorphism [formula] from part [\eqref=s2sum01a] is given by the formula

[formula]

Thus, for an element [formula] of odd order |x| = |(x,y)| = |y|, we have

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

as desired.

Example [\ref=symm045] shows why we must assume that 2 is a unit in R in the next result.

Assume that 2 is a unit in R, and let X be an R-complex.

The following exact sequences are split exact where [formula] and [formula] are the natural inclusions, [formula] is the natural surjection, and [formula] is induced by [formula]. The splitting on the right of the first sequence is given by [formula], and the splitting on the left of the second sequence is given by [formula]. In particular, there are isomorphisms

[formula]

If X is a bounded-below complex of projective R-modules, then so are the complexes [formula], [formula] and [formula].

[\eqref=symm05item0] The given exact sequences come from Properties [\eqref=symm04item5] and [\eqref=symm04item1]. The fact that [formula] is idempotent tells us that [formula] is a split injection with splitting given by [formula] and [formula] is a split surjection with splitting given by [formula]. The desired isomorphisms follow immediately from the splitting of the sequences.

[\eqref=symm05item1] With the isomorphisms from part [\eqref=symm05item0], the fact that [formula] is a bounded-below complex of projective R-modules implies that [formula], [formula] and [formula] are also bounded-below complexes of projective R-modules.

The next two results explicitly describe the modules in [formula] and [formula]. Note that the difference between parts [\eqref=betti01item1]-[\eqref=betti01item2] and part [\eqref=betti01item3] shows that the behavior documented in Example [\ref=symm045] is, in a sense, the norm, not the exception.

Let X be a complex of R-modules. Fix an integer n and set h = n / 2 and [formula].

If n is odd, then [formula].

If [formula], then [formula].

Assume that [formula].

There is an isomorphism

[formula]

and there is a surjection [formula] with [formula] generated by [formula].

If Xh is projective, then [formula] for some R-module K that is a homomorphic image of Xh / 2Xh.

If Xh is projective and 2 is a unit in R, then [formula].

[\eqref=betti01item1] Assume that n is odd. Let [formula] be given on generators by the formula

[formula]

Since n is odd, this is a well-defined isomorphism. Let [formula] be given by g(v,v') = (v - v',v' - v). This yields a commutative diagram

[formula]

Note that the commutativity depends on the fact that n is odd, because it implies that |x||x'| is even for each [formula].

The map [formula] given by f(v,v')  =  v + v' is a surjective homomorphism with [formula]. This explains the last isomorphism in the next sequence

[formula]

The other isomorphism follows from diagram [\eqref=betti01item1a].

[\eqref=betti01item2]-[\eqref=betti01item3] When n is even, we have a similar commutative diagram

[formula]

where γ' and g' are given by

[formula]

In other words, we have [formula] where [formula] is given by

[formula]

The following sequence of isomorphisms follows directly

[formula]

If [formula], then h is even, so we have

[formula]

For the remainder of the proof, we assume that [formula], that is, that h is odd. In this case, we have

[formula]

It is straightforward to show that

[formula]

Hence, there is an epimorphism

[formula]

such that

[formula]

The conclusions of part [\eqref=betti01item3a] follow from setting [formula].

For the rest of the proof, we assume that Xh is projective. It follows that [formula] is also projective, hence the surjection τ1 splits. Setting [formula], we have [formula]. Using [\eqref=betti01b] and [\eqref=betti01a] we see that the map [formula] given by [formula] is surjective with [formula]. It follows that K is a homomorphic image of Xh / 2Xh, which establishes part [\eqref=betti01item3b]. Finally, part [\eqref=betti01item3c] follows directly from [\eqref=betti01item3b]: if 2 is a unit in R, then Xh / 2Xh = 0.

Let X be a complex of R-modules. Fix an integer n and set h = n / 2 and [formula].

If n is odd, then [formula].

If [formula], then [formula].

If [formula], then [formula].

Set [formula].

[\eqref=betti01'item1]-[\eqref=betti01'item2] If n is odd or [formula], then Yn = 0; hence [formula], and the desired conclusions follow from Theorem [\ref=betti01][\eqref=betti01item1]-[\eqref=betti01item2].

[\eqref=betti01'item3] Assume that [formula]. The surjection [formula] from Theorem [\ref=betti01][\eqref=betti01item3a] has [formula] generated by [formula]; that is [formula], so we have

[formula]

as desired.

We state the next result for [formula] only, because Theorem [\ref=betti01] shows that it is only reasonable to consider such formulas for [formula] when 2 is a unit; in this case the formulas are the same because of the isomorphism [formula].

Let X be a bounded-below complex of finite rank free R-modules. For each integer l, set [formula]. Then each R-module [formula] is free and

[formula]

Using the notation of Theorem [\ref=betti01'] we have

[formula]

and, when n is even

[formula]

The desired formula now follows from Theorem [\ref=betti01'].

Homological Properties of [formula]

This section documents the homological and homotopical aspects of the functor [formula]. It also contains our proof of Theorem [\ref=intthmC] from the introduction. We assume throughout this section that 2 is a unit in R, and it follows that [formula] via the natural map for all X.

We begin with the following result showing that [formula] exhibits properties similar to those for [formula] noted in Fact [\ref=fact01]. Example [\ref=symm045] shows what goes wrong in part [\eqref=symm09item2] when inf (X) is odd: we have [formula] so [formula]. Note that we do not need R to be local in either part of this result.

Assume that 2 is a unit in R and let X be a bounded-below complex of projective R-modules.

There is an inequality [formula] and there is an isomorphism

[formula]

Assume that R is noetherian and that [formula] is finitely generated. If inf (X) is even, then [formula].

[\eqref=symm09item1] Set i =  inf (X). Proposition [\ref=symm05][\eqref=symm05item1] yields an isomorphism

[formula]

This isomorphism yields the first inequality in the next sequence

[formula]

while the second inequality is in Fact [\ref=fact01].

The split exact sequences from Proposition [\ref=symm05][\eqref=symm05item0] fit together in the following commutative diagram

[formula]

Define [formula] by the formula

[formula]

It is straightforward to show that the following diagram commutes

[formula]

where the isomorphism γ is from Fact [\ref=fact01]. Together, diagrams [\eqref=seqdiag01] and [\eqref=seqdiag01'] yield the next commutative diagram

[formula]

whose rows are exact because the rows of diagram [\eqref=seqdiag01] are split exact. A straightforward diagram-chase yields the equality [formula] and so

[formula]

[\eqref=symm09item2] Using part [\eqref=symm09item1], it suffices to to show that [formula] where i =  inf (X). Fix a maximal ideal [formula], and set [formula]. Using the isomorphisms

[formula]

Nakayama's Lemma implies that [formula] is a nonzero k-vector space of finite rank, say [formula]. In the following sequence, the first and third isomorphisms are well-known; see, e.g., [\cite=eisenbud:ca]:

[formula]

It follows that [formula], as desired.

The next result establishes the homotopy-theoretic properties of the functor [formula]. Example [\ref=symm05c] shows that conclusion fails when 2 is not a unit in R. Note that we cannot reduce part [\eqref=symm05aitem1] to the case g = 0 by replacing f by f - g, as Example [\ref=notadd01] shows that [formula] might not equal [formula].

Assume that 2 is a unit in R, and let X and Y be R-complexes. Fix morphisms f,g:X  →  Y and h:Y  →  X.

If f and g are homotopic, then [formula] and [formula] are homotopic.

If f is a homotopy equivalence with homotopy inverse h, then [formula] is a homotopy equivalence with homotopy inverse [formula].

[\eqref=symm05aitem1] Fix a homotopy s from f to g as in Definition [\ref=notn02']. Define

[formula]

on each generator [formula] by the formulas

[formula]

One checks readily that the sequences [formula] and [formula] are homotopies from [formula] to [formula]. As 2 is a unit in R, it follows that the sequence

[formula]

is also a homotopy from [formula] to [formula]. It is straightforward to show that [formula] for all n. Using the fact that σ is a homotopy from [formula] to [formula], it is thus straightforward to show that σ induces a homotopy [formula] from [formula] to [formula] by the formula [formula].

[\eqref=symm05aitem2] By hypothesis, the composition hf is homotopic to [formula]. Part [\eqref=symm05aitem1] implies that [formula] is homotopic to [formula]. The same logic implies that [formula] is homotopic to [formula], and hence the desired conclusions.

For the next results, Examples [\ref=koszul01''] and [\ref=symm05c] show why we need to assume that X and Y are bounded-below complexes of projective R-modules and 2 is a unit in R.

Assume that 2 is a unit in R, and let X and Y be bounded-below complexes of projective R-modules.

If f:X  →  Y is a quasiisomorphism, then so is [formula].

If X≃Y, then [formula].

[\eqref=symm05bitem2] Our assumptions imply that f is a homotopy equivalence by Fact [\ref=fact0001], so the desired conclusion follows from Theorem [\ref=symm05a][\eqref=symm05aitem2].

[\eqref=symm05bitem3] Assume X≃Y. Because X and Y are bounded-below complexes of projective R-modules, there is a quasiisomorphism [formula]. Now apply part [\eqref=symm05bitem2].

If 2 is a unit in R and X is a bounded-below complex of projective R-modules, then there is a containment [formula].

Fix a prime ideal [formula]. It suffices to show [formula]. The first isomorphism in the following sequence is from Proposition [\ref=loc01][\eqref=loc01item2]

[formula]

The quasiisomorphism follows from Corollary [\ref=symm05b][\eqref=symm05bitem3] because [formula].

The following result is key for our proof of Theorem [\ref=intthmC].

Assume that R is noetherian and local and that 2 is a unit in R. Let X be a bounded-below complex of finite-rank free R-modules. The following conditions are equivalent:

the surjection [formula] is a quasiisomorphism;

[formula];

the injection [formula] is a quasiisomorphism;

either X≃0 or [formula] for some integer n.

[\eqref=symm07item1a] The biimplications [\eqref=symm07item1a][formula][\eqref=symm07item1c][formula][\eqref=symm07item1b] follow easily from the long exact sequences associated to the exact sequences in Proposition [\ref=symm05][\eqref=symm05item0].

[\eqref=symm07item1d][formula][\eqref=symm07item1a]. If X≃0, then [formula] and so [formula] is trivially a quasiisomorphism; see Fact [\ref=fact01] and Example [\ref=symm04item4].

Assuming that [formula], there is a quasiisomorphism [formula]. The commutative diagrams from [\eqref=symm04item3] and [\eqref=symm04item2] can be combined and augmented to form the following commutative diagram:

[formula]

The morphism [formula] is a quasiisomorphism by Fact [\ref=fact01], and [formula] is a quasiisomorphism by Corollary [\ref=symm05b][\eqref=symm05bitem2]. One checks readily that [formula] so [formula] is an isomorphism. The diagram shows that [formula] is a quasiisomorphism, and hence so is [formula]. It follows that [formula] is a quasiisomorphism, as desired.

[\eqref=symm07item1a][formula][\eqref=symm07item1d]. Assume that the surjection [formula] is a quasiisomorphism and [formula].

Case 1: X is minimal. This implies that [formula] is minimal. Also, since [formula] is a direct summand of [formula], it follows that [formula] is also minimal. The fact that [formula] is a quasiisomorphism then implies that it is an isomorphism; see Fact [\ref=fact0001'']. This explains the second equality in the next sequence

[formula]

The third equality is from equation [\eqref=betti02eq1]. It follows that

[formula]

Let i  =   inf (X) and note that [formula]. Set [formula] for each n and [formula], so that we have PRX(t) = tiQ(t). Equation [\eqref=poinc02a] then reads as t2iQ(t)2 = ( - 1)it2iQ( - t2), that is, we have

[formula]

If i were odd, then this would say Q(t)2 + Q( - t2) = 0, contradicting Lemma [\ref=poinc01][\eqref=poinc01item1]. It follows that i = 2n for some n. Equation [\eqref=poinc02b] then says Q(t)2 - Q( - t2) = 0, and so Lemma [\ref=poinc01][\eqref=poinc01item2] implies that Q(t) = 1. This says that PRX(t) = ti = t2n and so [formula], as desired.

Case 2: the general case. Let [formula] be a minimal free resolution. We again augment the commutative diagram from [\eqref=symm04item2]

[formula]

This implies that [formula] is a quasiisomorphism. Since P is minimal, Case 1 implies that either P≃0 or [formula] for some integer n. Since we have X≃P, the desired conclusion follows.

We next show how Theorem [\ref=intthmC] is a consequence of Theorem [\ref=symm07].

The next result is a companion to Theorem [\ref=symm07].

Assume that R is noetherian and local, and that 2 is a unit in R. Let X be a bounded-below complex of finite rank free R-modules. The following conditions are equivalent:

the morphism [formula] is a quasiisomorphism;

the surjection [formula] is a quasiisomorphism;

the injection [formula] is a quasiisomorphism;

[formula];

[formula];

X≃0 or [formula] for some integer n.

The biimplications [\eqref=symm07item2b][formula][\eqref=symm07item2e] and [\eqref=symm07item2c][formula][\eqref=symm07item2d] follow easily from the long exact sequences associated to the exact sequences in Proposition [\ref=symm05][\eqref=symm05item0].

For the remainder of the proof, we use the easily verified fact that the exact sequences from Proposition [\ref=symm05][\eqref=symm05item0] fit together in the following commutative diagram

[formula]

and we recall that these exact sequences split.

[\eqref=symm07item2a][formula][\eqref=symm07item2d]. Assume that [formula] is a quasiisomorphism.

Case 1: X is minimal. Since X is minimal, the same is true of [formula], so the fact that [formula] is a quasiisomorphism implies that [formula] is an isomorphism; see Fact [\ref=fact0001'']. Hence, we have [formula].

Case 2: the general case. Let [formula] be a minimal free resolution. The commutative diagram from [\eqref=symm04item2]

[formula]

shows that [formula] is a quasiisomorphism; see Fact [\ref=fact01]. Using Corollary [\ref=symm05b][\eqref=symm05bitem2], Case 1 implies that [formula].

[\eqref=symm07item2d][formula][\eqref=symm07item2e] and [\eqref=symm07item2d][formula][\eqref=symm07item2a] and [\eqref=symm07item2d][formula][\eqref=symm07item2f]. Assume that [formula].

Case 1: X is minimal. In this case [formula] is also minimal. The bottom row of [\eqref=seqdiag02] is split exact, so this implies that [formula] is also minimal. Hence, the condition [formula] implies that [formula]. Hence, the following sequence is split exact

[formula]

Since each R-module [formula] is free of finite rank, the additivity of rank implies that [formula] for all n, that is [formula]. The displayed sequence then shows that [formula] is an isomorphism.

Assume for the rest of this case that [formula] and set i =  inf (X). If i is even, then Proposition [\ref=symm09] implies that [formula], a contradiction. Thus i is odd. As before, there is a formal power series [formula] with nonnegative integer coefficients such that r0  ≠  0 and PRX(t) = tiQ(t). Since [formula] the following formal equalities are from [\eqref=betti02eq1]:

[formula]

It follows that Q(t)2 - Q( - t2) = 0, so Lemma [\ref=poinc01][\eqref=poinc01item2] implies that Q(t) = 1. This implies that PRX(t)  =  ti and so [formula].

Case 2: the general case. Let f:P  →  X be a minimal free resolution. Corollary [\ref=symm05b] implies that [formula], so Case 1 also implies that either X≃P≃0 or [formula] for some integer n. Case 1 also implies that [formula] and [formula] is an isomorphism. The commutative diagram from [\eqref=symm04item2]

[formula]

shows that [formula] is a quasiisomorphism; see Fact [\ref=fact01]. Since [formula], the bottom row of [\eqref=seqdiag02] shows that [formula] is a quasiisomorphism. Since [formula] is also a quasiisomorphism, the commutativity of [\eqref=seqdiag02] shows that [formula] is a quasiisomorphism as well. Hence, the top row of [\eqref=seqdiag02] implies that [formula].

[\eqref=symm07item2e][formula][\eqref=symm07item2d]. Argue as in the proof of the implication [\eqref=symm07item2d][formula][\eqref=symm07item2e].

[\eqref=symm07item2f][formula][\eqref=symm07item2d]. If X≃0, then [formula] by Example [\ref=symm04item4] and Corollary [\ref=symm05b][\eqref=symm05bitem3]. If [formula] for some integer n, then Corollary [\ref=symm05b][\eqref=symm05bitem3] explains the first quasiisomorphism in the next sequence

[formula]

The second quasiisomorphism is because of the isomorphism [formula]; the third quasiisomorphism is from [\eqref=symm04item3]; and the last quasiisomorphism follows from Example [\ref=symm045].

Assume that R is noetherian and local, and that 2 is a unit in R. Let X be a bounded-below complex of finite rank free R-modules. Then [formula] has finite projective dimension if and only if X has finite projective dimension.

Assume first that [formula] is finite, and let [formula] be a bounded free resolution. It follows that [formula] is a bounded complex of free R-modules. Hence, the isomorphism [formula] from Proposition [\ref=symm05][\eqref=symm05item1] implies that [formula] is a bounded complex of free R-modules. The quasiisomorphism [formula] from Corollary [\ref=symm05b][\eqref=symm05bitem3] implies that [formula] has finite projective dimension.

For the converse, assume that X has infinite projective dimension. Let [formula] be a minimal free resolution, which is necessarily unbounded. As we have noted previously, the fact that P is minimal implies that [formula] is a minimal free resolution, so it suffices to show that [formula] is unbounded; see Fact [\ref=fact0001''].

Set [formula] for each integer n. Since P is unbounded, we know that, for each integer n, there exist integers p and q such that q > p > n and such that the free R-modules Pp and Pq are nonzero, that is, such that rprq  ≠  0. The inequality q > p implies p < (p + q) / 2. For each [formula], we then have p + q > 2n and

[formula]

The first inequality is from Corollary [\ref=betti011]; the second inequality follows from the inequality p < (p + q) / 2; and the third inequality follows from the assumption rprq  ≠  0. This shows that for each [formula], that is an integer m = p + q > n such that [formula]. This means that [formula] is unbounded, as desired.

The final result of this section is a refinement of the previous result. It characterizes the complexes X such that [formula] for some integer j.

Assume that R is noetherian and local, and that 2 is a unit in R. Let X be a bounded-below complex of finite rank free R-modules. The folowing conditions are equivalent:

[formula] for some n or [formula] for some n and m;

[formula] for some even integer j;

[formula] for some integer j.

[\eqref=s2fpd02c][formula][\eqref=s2fpd02a]. If [formula], then we have

[formula]

by [\eqref=symm04item3], Example [\ref=symm04item4] and Corollary [\ref=symm05b][\eqref=symm05bitem3]. If [formula], then Proposition [\ref=s2sum01] implies

[formula]

Example [\ref=symm045] implies that the first and last summands on the right side are 0, so

[formula]

[\eqref=s2fpd02a][formula][\eqref=s2fpd02b]. This is trivial.

[\eqref=s2fpd02b][formula][\eqref=s2fpd02c]. Assume that [formula], which implies [formula]. Use Corollary [\ref=symm05b][\eqref=symm05bitem3] to replace X with a minimal free resolution in order to assume that X is minimal. As we have noted before, this implies that [formula] is minimal, so the quasiisomorphism [formula] implies [formula]; see Fact [\ref=fact0001''].

For each integer n, set [formula]. Also, set i  =   inf (X), and note that Proposition [\ref=symm09] implies that [formula]. Write [formula]; this is a formal power series with nonnegative integer coefficients and constant term [formula] such that PRX(t)  =  tiQ(t). Since [formula], equation [\eqref=betti02eq1] can be written as

[formula]

Case 1: j  =  2i. In this case, equation [\eqref=s2fpd02pfeq01] then reads as

[formula]

and so 2  =  Q(t)2 + ( - 1)iQ( - t2). Lemma [\ref=poinc01] implies that

[formula]

When i is even, this translates to PRX(t) = ti and so [formula] where n = i / 2. When i is odd, we have PRX(t) = 2 and so [formula] where n = (i - 1) / 2.

Case 2: j > 2i. In this case, Proposition [\ref=symm09] implies that i is odd, and equation [\eqref=s2fpd02pfeq01] translates as

[formula]

Since j > 2i, we equate coefficients in degree 0 to find 0  =  r2i  -  ri, and so ri  =  1. Thus, equation [\eqref=s2fpd02pfeq04] reads as

[formula]

We claim that j > 2i + 1. Indeed, supposing that [formula], our assumption j > 2i implies j  =  2i + 1. Equating degree 1 coefficients in equation [\eqref=s2fpd02pfeq03] yields ri + 1 = 1. The coefficients in degree 2 show that

[formula]

Hence ri + 2  =   - 1, which is a contradiction.

Since we have j  >  2i + 1, the degree 1 coefficients in equation [\eqref=s2fpd02pfeq03] imply ri + 1  =  0. It follows that

[formula]

where Y is a bounded-below minimal complex of finitely generated free R-modules such that Yn = 0 for all n < i + 2. With the isomorphism in [\eqref=s2fpd02pfeq02], Proposition [\ref=s2sum01] gives the second isomorphism in the next sequence

[formula]

The final isomorphism comes from Example [\ref=symm045] since i is odd. In particular, it follows that [formula]. The complex [formula] is indecomposable because R is local, so the displayed sequence implies that [formula] and [formula]. Because of the conditions [formula] and [formula], Theorem [\ref=symm07''] implies that [formula] for some m. Hence, the isomorphism in [\eqref=s2fpd02pfeq02] reads as [formula] where n = (i - 1) / 2, as desired.

Examples

We begin this section with three explicit computations of the complexes [formula] and [formula] and their homologies. As a consequence, we show that Buchbaum and Eisenbud's construction differs from those in [\cite=dold:hnafa] [\cite=tchernev:frpf]. We also provide examples showing the need for certain hypotheses in the results of the previous sections.

Fix an element x∈R and let K denote the Koszul complex KR(x) which has the following form, where the basis is listed in each degree

[formula]

The tensor product [formula] has the form

[formula]

Using this representation, the exact sequence in [\eqref=symm04item1] has the form

[formula]

From the rightmost column of this diagram, we have

[formula]

and [formula] when i∉{0,1,2}.

A similar computation shows that

[formula]

and thus

[formula]

and [formula] when i∉{0,1}.

Fix elements x,y∈R and let K denote the Koszul complex KR(x,y) which has the following form, where the ordered basis is listed in each degree

[formula]

Using the same format, the complex [formula] has the form

[formula]

with differentials given by the following matrices:

[formula]

Under the same bases, the morphism [formula] is described by the following matrices:

[formula]

As in Example [\ref=symm03], it follows that [formula] has the form

[formula]

where the basis vectors are described as

[formula]

(Note also that [formula].) Under these bases, the differentials [formula] are described by the following matrices:

[formula]

Similar computations show that [formula].

Let x,y∈R be an R-regular sequence and continue with the notation of Example [\ref=koszul01]. We verify the following isomorphisms:

[formula]

The computation of [formula] follows from the description of [formula] in [\eqref=s2K01].

For [formula], the second equality in the following sequence comes from the exactness of K in degree 1

[formula]

and the others come from the descriptions of K and [formula] in [\eqref=K01] and [\eqref=s2K01].

For [formula], use the fact that x is R-regular to check the first equality in the next display; the others follow from [\eqref=s2K01].

[formula]

The isomorphism [formula] now follows.

For [formula], the second equality in the following sequence comes from the exactness of K in degree 1

[formula]

and the others come from the descriptions of K and [formula] in [\eqref=K01] and [\eqref=s2K01]. The isomorphism [formula] now follows.

Similarly, for [formula], we have

[formula]

This completes the example.

As a first consequence of the previous computations, we next observe that [formula] is generally not isomorphic to Dold and Puppe's [\cite=dold:hnafa] construction [formula] and not isomorphic to Tchernev and Weyman's [\cite=tchernev:frpf] construction [formula].

Assume that 2 is a unit in R. Fix an element x∈R and let K denote the Koszul complex KR(x). Example [\ref=symm03] yields the following computation of [formula]

[formula]

The fact that [formula] and [formula] have the displayed form can be deduced from [\cite=tchernev:frpf]; the maps were computed for us by Tchernev. In particular, in this case we have [formula].

More generally, if we have

[formula]

then Corollary [\ref=betti011] and [\cite=tchernev:frpf] yield

[formula]

Hence, we have [formula] if and only if m = 0, i.e., if and only if [formula].

We next show why we need to assume that X and Y are bounded-below complexes of projective R-modules in Corollary [\ref=symm05b]. It also shows that [formula] can have nontrivial homology, even when X is a minimal free resolution of a module of finite projective dimension.

Let x,y∈R be an R-regular sequence and continue with the notation of Example [\ref=koszul01]. The computations in Example [\ref=koszul01'] show that [formula], and so [formula] even though K≃R / (x,y).

The next example shows why we need to assume that 2 is a unit in R for Theorem [\ref=symm05a] and Corollaries [\ref=symm05b] and [\ref=loc01'].

Assume that 2 is not a unit in R and let K denote the Koszul complex KR(1,1). Then K is split exact, so the zero map z:K  →  K is a homotopy equivalence, it is homotopic to [formula], and it is a quasiisomorphism. Example [\ref=koszul01] shows that [formula]. On the other hand, the morhpism [formula] is the zero morphism, so the nonvanishing of [formula] implies that [formula] is not a quasiisomorphism. It follows that [formula] is neither a homotopy equivalence nor homotopic to [formula]. This shows why we must assume that 2 is a unit in R for Theorem [\ref=symm05a] and Corollary [\ref=symm05b][\eqref=symm05bitem2]. For Corollary [\ref=symm05b][\eqref=symm05bitem3] simply note that K≃0 and [formula]. For Corollary [\ref=loc01'], note that this shows that [formula].

Our next example shows that the functors [formula] and [formula] are not additive, even when 2 is a unit in R and we restrict to bounded complexes of finite rank free R-modules.

Let X and Y be nonzero R-complexes. Consider the natural surjections and injections

[formula]

and set [formula]. The equality [formula] is immediate.

We claim that [formula]. To see this, first note that the equalities [formula] show that it suffices to verify [formula]. One checks that there is a commutative diagram

[formula]

wherein the horizontal maps are the natural distributivity isomorphisms. The proof of Proposition [\ref=s2sum01] yields another commutative diagram

[formula]

Similarly, there is another commutative diagram

[formula]

This implies that [formula] is equivalent to the morphism

[formula]

and so cannot equal [formula].

Similarly, we have [formula].

Our final example shows that one needs to be careful about removing the local hypotheses from the results of Section [\ref=sec03]. Specifically, it shows that, without the local hypothesis, the implication [\eqref=symm07item1a][formula][\eqref=symm07item1d] fails in Theorem [\ref=symm07].

Let K and L be fields, and set R = K  ×  L. The prime ideals of R are all maximal, and they are precisely the ideals [formula] and [formula]. Furthermore, we have [formula] and [formula]. Assume that [formula] and [formula], so that 2 is a unit in R.

First, consider the complex [formula]. Then Y is a bounded-below complex of finitely generated projective R-modules such that [formula] and [formula]. Hence, Remark [\ref=disc0002] implies that the surjection [formula] is a quasiisomorphism. However, the fact that Y has nonzero homology in degrees 2 and 0 implies that [formula] and [formula] for each integer t.

Next we provide an example of a bounded-below complex X of finitely generated free R-modules with the same behavior. The following complex describes a free resolution F of K  ×  0

[formula]

where e = (1,0)∈R and f = (0,1)∈R. An R-free resolution G for 0  ×  L is constructed similarly. The complex [formula] yields a degreewise-finite R-free resolution of [formula]. Corollary [\ref=symm05b][\eqref=symm05bitem2] implies that [formula] is a quasiisomorphism. Hence, the next commutative diagram shows that the surjection [formula] is also a quasiisomorphism.

[formula]

However, we have X≃Y, and so [formula] and [formula] for each integer t.
