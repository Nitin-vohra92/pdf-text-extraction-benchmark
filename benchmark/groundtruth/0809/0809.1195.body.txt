Weakly nonlinear stability of regimes of free hydromagnetic thermal convection in a rotating horizontal layer with free electrically conducting boundaries is considered in the Boussinesq approximation. Perturbations are supposed to involve large spatial and temporal scales. Applying methods for homogenisation of parabolic equations, we derive the system of amplitude equations governing the evolution of perturbations under the assumption that the α  -  effect is insignificant in the leading order. The amplitude equations involve the operators of anisotropic combined eddy diffusivity correction and advection. The system is qualitatively different from the system of mean-field equations for large-scale perturbations of forced convective hydromagnetic regimes. It is mixed: equations for the mean magnetic perturbation are evolutionary, all the rest involve neither time derivatives, nor the molecular diffusivity operator.

thermal convection, magnetic dynamo, weakly nonlinear stability, amplitude equations, mean-field equations, α  -  effect, eddy diffusivity

This paper is a continuation of Zheligovsky (2008), further referred to as Zh08, where the relevance of the problem considered here for geophysical applications is discussed and the work of other authors in this area is reviewed in detail.

Our ultimate motivation is the same as in Zh08: we would like to find examples of "real" convective dynamos, whose weakly non-linear perturbations have upon saturation a complex structure and exhibit a complex temporal behaviour, but remain "stable" being uniformly bounded in time. In such examples various "eddy" effects, representing the integral influence of the small-scale dynamics on the large-scale structures, on the one hand, should play an important rôle in the evolution of the CHM system; on the other, they must not be introduced ad hoc empirically, but rather follow from the basic principles. Saturation is impossible if eddy diffusivity is negative. Thus, although we use the same mathematical approach, our aim is in a sense opposite to that of Dubrulle and Frisch (1991), Zheligovsky et al. (2001) and Zheligovsky (2003), who investigated the effects of negative eddy viscosity and diffusivity as the mechanisms of hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic instability. The perturbations can only have a complex spatial structure and/or demonstrate a complex temporal behaviour, if the amplitude equations that are governing them are themselves complex enough; this is one of the reasons, why we are obliged to consider a rather general case.

Weakly nonlinear stability to large-scale perturbations of a free convective hydromagnetic (CHM) regime [formula] in a rotating horizontal layer is considered here. Our immediate goal is to derive amplitude equations governing the evolution of the perturbations under the assumption that the α  -  effect is insignificant in the leading order. The amplitude equations ([\ref=eq59]), ([\ref=eq62]) and ([\ref=eqtimedep]) (the latter equation emerges if the perturbed CHM regime is non-steady), that we derive in this paper, involve a linear operator of combined eddy diffusivity correction and a nonlinear operator of anisotropic combined eddy advection. Both operators are anisotropic. The system has new qualitative features, compared to the system of mean-field equations for large-scale perturbations of forced CHM regimes derived in Zh08. It does not involve mean flow perturbations, and it is mixed: whereas equations ([\ref=eq62]) for the mean magnetic perturbation are evolutionary, the remaining ones, ([\ref=eq59]) and ([\ref=eqtimedep]), do not involve time derivatives or molecular diffusivity operators. The derivations follow the way paved in Zh08; consequently, the two papers are similar in structure.

In the Boussinesq approximation the evolution of the perturbation satisfies the vorticity

and heat transfer

[formula]

equations, as well as the solenoidality conditions

[formula]

[formula]

(Following Zh08 we use the vorticity equation in place of the momentum equation to eliminate pressure.) The following notation is used: [formula] and

[formula]

are velocity and vorticity, respectively, of a flow of an electrically conducting fluid, [formula] magnetic field, [formula] temperature, t time, ν, η and κ kinematic, magnetic and thermal molecular diffusivities, respectively, τ / 2 angular velocity of the rotation, [formula] the buoyancy force, [formula] is the unit vector along the axis xk of the Cartesian coordinate system corotating with the layer.

The CHM regime is free in the sense that no source terms are present in the equations (); consequently, the regime is spatially and temporally invariant, i.e. there is no dependence of the coefficients in these equations neither on the position in space, nor on time.

The so called small-angle instability problem (see Podvigina 2008a, 2009 and references therein) is a well-known example of a problem of stability to large-scale perturbations, in which linear stability of amagnetic convective regimes (rolls) near the onset is considered. Note, however, that it does not fall into the class of problems considered here (even if the difference between linear and weakly nonlinear kinds of stability is neglected), since it involves two different large scales; like in Zh08, we consider only one large scale.

The following conditions are assumed on the horizontal boundaries of the layer: [formula] no stress:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula] perfectly electrically conducting boundaries:

[formula]

[formula] isothermal boundaries:

[formula]

(Cartesian vector components are enumerated by the subscript.)

It is convenient to introduce a new variable Θ  =  T  -  T1  +  δ(x3 + L / 2), which satisfies the equation

[formula]

and homogeneous boundary conditions:

[formula]

We define the spatial mean and the oscillatory part of a scalar or vector field f:

[formula]

and the spatio-temporal mean and oscillatory parts of f are

[formula]

〈f〉k and 〈〈f〉〉k denote the k - th Cartesian components of the respective means,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Following Zh08, the subscripts v and h are thus used to denote vertical and horizontal components of three-dimensional mean vector fields. The superscripts v and h have a different meaning: they denote the flow velocity and magnetic field components of 10-dimensional vector fields [formula], and 7-dimensional [formula].

Linearisation of equations ([\ref=eq1p5]), ([\ref=eq1p2]) and ([\ref=eq3]) in the vicinity of the CHM regime [formula] gives rise to the operators

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The operator of linearisation of the system () is L = (Lω,Lh,Lθ).

We consider weakly nonlinear regimes of perturbations, the amplitude of which is of the order of ε. The perturbed state Ω  +  ε, εv, εh, Θ  +  εθ also satisfies () and ([\ref=eq3]), and hence the profiles of perturbations [formula] (henceforth called perturbations) satisfy the equations

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Averaging of the horizontal component of the Navier-Stokes equation over the fluid volume yields

[formula]

We assume that there is no mean horizontal fluid flow through the layer, i.e. at any time [formula] and

[formula]

We introduce the slow spatial, [formula], and temporal, T = ε2t, variables. (We assume that the layer width L is of the order of unity, and hence a slow variable in the vertical direction is not introduced.) For vector fields depending both on fast and slow variables, integration in the definitions () of mean fields is performed only over the small-scale fast variables [formula] or [formula]. The exponent in the temporal scale ratio is suitable for CHM regimes with an insignificant α  -  effect. A power series solution to the problem () is sought:

[formula]

Solenoidality conditions for the flow, magnetic field and vorticity result in the following equations: for any [formula],

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

(In differential operators with the indices [formula] and [formula] differentiation in the respective spatial fast and slow variables is performed; [formula]. Differentiation in fast variables only is assumed in the definitions () of linearisation operators. All quantities for n < 0 are zero by definition.)

The identity ([\ref=eq5p6]) translates into the equation

[formula]

Equations ([\ref=eq17p2]) and ([\ref=eq17p3]), together with ([\ref=eqomega]) where the index is n changed to n - 1, implies that the right-hand side of ([\ref=eqomega]) is solenoidal in fast variables. The solvability condition for ([\ref=eqomega]) is

[formula]

This equation has a solution, if the mean of 〈n〉v over the plane of slow variables vanishes. Equation ([\ref=eqomega]) then reduces to

[formula]

and a solution {n}h can be found as a sum of solutions to two Neumann problems (see Zh08).

A hierarchy of equations (A.1)-(A.3) (derived in Zh08 and presented here in Appendix A for reader's convenience) emerges at different orders of ε upon substitution of the series ([\ref=pertser]) into ([\ref=eq5om])-([\ref=eq5p3]) and expansion of the resulting equation in power series in ε. We will solve them successively, essentially following the procedure described in Sections 5-9 of Zh08. For n > 0 the order of calculations is not quite straightforward, for each n it involves the following steps: [formula] Derive a PDE in slow variables in 〈〈n - 1〉〉v and find 〈n〉h  -  〈〈n〉〉h using the mean and oscillatory, respectively, part of the spatial average of the vertical component of (A.1) at order εn + 1. [formula] Derive a PDE in slow variables in 〈〈n - 2〉〉h and calculate 〈n〉h  -  〈〈n〉〉h using the mean and oscillatory, respectively, part of the spatial average of the horizontal component of (A.2) at order εn. [formula] Find the potential parts (in fast variables) of [formula] and [formula], applying (). [formula] Applying results of the previous steps, derive from (A.1)-(A.3) a system of PDE's in fast variables in solenoidal parts of [formula] and θn. [formula] Applying two solvability conditions, calculate 〈〈n〉〉. (The averages considered at steps [formula] and [formula] also represent solvability conditions for the system (A.1)-(A.3), see Section 5.) Apply the remaining solvability conditions, if any are not yet satisfied. [formula] Use the system of PDE's derived at the previous step to calculate [formula] and θn in the terms of solutions to auxiliary problems and the yet unknown spatio-temporal averages of the terms of expansions ([\ref=pertser]). At this stage solution of the system (A.1)-(A.3) for the considered index n is completed, and we continue by solving the equations at the next order εn + 1 starting anew with step [formula] Since the equations for n = 0 studied in the next section are homogenous, they represent a special case, in which the flow of operations is slightly altered. In what follows, we indicate at each point, which step is being carried out. Although we stop as soon as derive the amplitude equations, further application of the procedure would yield solutions to an arbitrary number of successive systems (A.1)-(A.3) in the hierarchy. Thus a complete asymptotic expansion ([\ref=pertser]) can be constructed.

Equations (A.1)-(A.3), ([\ref=eqomega]) and solenoidality conditions ([\ref=eq17p2])-([\ref=eq17p5]) reduce for n = 0 to

[formula]

[formula]

Differentiation of ([\ref=eq1p5]), ([\ref=eq1p2]) and ([\ref=eq3]) in xk, k = 1,2, or in time t demonstrates that [formula] and [formula] are solutions to (). They satisfy the boundary conditions, whichever of them (no stress or no slip boundaries, built of perfectly conducting or a dielectric material, isothermal or transferring a prescribed heat flow) are chosen for the flow, magnetic field and temperature. This is a consequence of the assumed spatial and temporal invariance of the equation, governing the CHM regime [formula]. The three solutions to () are not guaranteed to be linearly independent; for instance, [formula] for steady CHM regimes. Also, [formula] are linearly dependent, if the CHM state is independent of a horizontal variable a1x1 + a2x2 for some constant a1 and a2, not vanishing together; we will not consider such essentially two-dimensional CHM regimes.

Whether other solutions to () exist depends on the assumed boundary conditions and on the parameter values. In what follows we consider boundary conditions ([\ref=eq2SF]), ([\ref=eq2EC]) and ([\ref=eq2FT]). They are inherently consistent with the solenoidality conditions and thereby they are widely used in numerical studies of thermal convection and convective dynamos (see, e.g., Podvigina 2006, 2008b).

Following Zh08, we introduce the operator of linearisation in the form

[formula]

Here R is the inverse curl, acting from the space of solenoidal vector fields globally bounded in the layer and satisfying ([\ref=eq2SFOm]), with a zero spatial mean of the vertical component, into the space of solenoidal vector fields satisfying ([\ref=eq2SF]), with a zero spatial mean of the horizontal component (see Zh08, Section 3). The domain of M, which we denote by D, consists of vector fields [formula], globally bounded in the layer, satisfying the respective boundary conditions, and such that [formula] and [formula] are solenoidal with 〈〉v  =  .

The operator adjoint to M is M* = ((M*)ω,(M*)h,(M*)θ),

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Here the operator R' is another "inverse curl": [formula] is a solution to the problem

[formula]

satisfying ([\ref=eq2SFOm]), and P is the projection of a three-dimensional vector field into the subspace of solenoidal fields with a zero spatial mean of the horizontal component, satisfying boundary conditions ([\ref=eq2EC]) (see Section 3 in Zh08 for a detailed explanation). The operators M and M* turn out to have the same domain.

Clearly, [formula], where [formula] is a constant horizontal vector. Consequently, there exist eigenmodes [formula] of the operator M associated with the zero eigenvalue, for which 〈〈h〉〉h  ≠  . Since spatio-temporal means of [formula] and [formula] are zero, the latter neutral modes are distinct. We denote by [formula] the neutral modes with non-zero horizontal magnetic components, normalised so that [formula].

Step [formula] for n = 0. Averaging in space the horizontal magnetic component of ([\ref=eq20]) demonstrates that the spatial means of the horizontal magnetic field components are time-independent; thus 〈0〉h  =  〈〈0〉〉h. The normalisation is equivalent to the conditions [formula] at any time t  ≥  0. Spatial means of horizontal components of the flows [formula] are zero.

Thus, we have identified up to 5 different solutions to () in D existing for any parameter values: [formula], [formula], and if the CHM regime [formula] is unsteady [formula]. Consequently, the kernel of M* is spanned by 4 or 5 eigenfunctions [formula]: [formula] for k = 1,2, and [formula] exists for non-steady CHM regimes. [formula] can be chosen to be biorthogonal to [formula] and normalised so that

[formula]

for 1  ≤  k,j  ≤  K. Here K is the dimension of ker M, δkj is the Kronecker symbol, and the scalar product of 7-dimensional vector fields [formula] is assumed. The means 〈* vk〉h vanish for all k  ≤  5, 〈〈* hk〉〉h  =   for k = 1,2,5.

Step [formula] for n = 0. By linearity a solution to () can be expressed as

[formula]

(interpreted as an equality of 7-dimensional vectors). Here [formula] is a transient also satisfying the equations (): initial conditions for [formula], which can be found from ([\ref=eq23]) at t = 0, must belong to the stable manifold of the perturbed CHM state [formula], i.e. [formula] must exponentially decay in time t. Our task is to construct a closed system of equations for the leading order amplitudes [formula].

If the CHM regime [formula] possesses a symmetry about the vertical axis or parity invariance, perhaps involving a time shift [formula] (see the definitions in Section 7 in Zh08), then symmetric and antisymmetric sets of fields are invariant subspaces for the linearisation operator M. Thus any eigenmode is a symmetric or antisymmetric set of vector fields (if exponentially decaying transients of arbitrary symmetry are ignored in the case of time-dependent modes). In particular, all [formula] are antisymmetric sets, except for [formula], which is symmetric. Consequently, one can choose a basis in ker M*, where all vector fields are antisymmetric sets, except for a symmetric set [formula], if the CHM state [formula] is unsteady.

In this section we consider the system of equations

[formula]

[formula]

A solution to () exists only, if the following solvability conditions are satisfied:

[formula]

(stemming from ([\ref=MEQ5]) ),

[formula]

and

[formula]

for k = 1,2,5. Equation ([\ref=solveh]) is identical to relations ([\ref=solves]) for k = 3,4. (If the CHM state [formula] is steady, then ([\ref=solves]) is not considered for k = 5.)

We assume henceforth that the invariant subspace spanned by [formula], 1  ≤  k  ≤  K, is the complete kernel of M, where K is the number of eigenmodes in the basis in ker M: K = 4 or 5 for the steady and non-steady CHM states [formula], respectively. In the absence of space periodicity the conditions ([\ref=solveomega])-([\ref=solves]) may be insufficient for existence of a globally bounded solution to (): already quasi-periodicity in horizontal directions can be problematic. Nevertheless we do not impose periodicity conditions, which is too restrictive, but assume that the auxiliary problems of the form () do have solutions in D, if ([\ref=solveomega])-([\ref=solves]) hold true. Subtracting an appropriate linear combination of [formula], which belong to ker M, one obtains a solution to () with 〈〈〉〉h  =  .

For n = 0, ([\ref=eq19]) reduces to 〈0〉v  =  , which is compatible with () by virtue of the identity

[formula]

The solvability conditions can be used to demonstrate that, unlike in the case of forced convection, 〈0〉h  =  .

Step [formula] for n = 0. From (A.4) for n = 1,

[formula]

and hence ([\ref=eq19]) for n = 1 together with ([\ref=eq17p1]) for n = 0 implies

[formula]

However, [formula] is asymptotically smaller than any power of ε (see Zh08, Appendix C). Thus ([\ref=eq5p7]) requires [formula], i.e.

[formula]

and vanishing of the average of 〈〈0〉〉h over slow spatial variables.

Step [formula] for n = 0. Consequently, ([\ref=eq20]) reduces to

[formula]

Step [formula] for n = 0. Scalar multiplying this equation by [formula] and averaging the result, we find that

[formula]

is a necessary condition for existence of its solution. Hence, biorthogonality ([\ref=norm125]) of [formula] to [formula] for k,j = 1,2 implies, together with ([\ref=spmean]) and ([\ref=eq19]) for n = 1,

[formula]

In other words, solvability of ([\ref=Morder1]) in D requires that the mean perturbation flow vanishes. We further discuss this issue in Section 10.

In this section we derive the α  -  effect operators, present in the CHM system under consideration.

Step [formula] for n = 1. Substitution of the flow and magnetic field ([\ref=eq23]) into (A.4) for n = 2 yields

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

The differential operator in the right-hand side of ([\ref=eq30]) represents the AKA-effect (anisotropic kinematic α  -  effect) operator in the leading order. Integrating ([\ref=eq30]) in fast time, find

[formula]

Thus 〈2〉v is well-defined, if the means [formula] are. This is the condition of insignificance of the AKA-effect in the leading order. It is stronger than the solvability condition 〈〈ω〉〉v  =   for the equation [formula], which follows from ([\ref=eq11p1]) and in the case of (A.1) for n = 2 is

[formula]

The solution to equations ([\ref=eq19]) for n = 2 and ([\ref=eq17p1]) for n = 1 is therefore

[formula]

where [formula] is the inverse Laplacian in slow variables, acting from the space of globally bounded functions, whose average in [formula] is zero, into the same space;

[formula]

Step [formula] for n = 1. A possible presence of magnetic α  -  effect in the CHM system with electrically conducting boundaries ([\ref=eq2EC]) can be revealed similarly. Averaging of the horizontal component of (A.2) for n = 1 in fast spatial variables with the use of the identity

[formula]

and substitution of the flow and magnetic component of ([\ref=eq23]) yields

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

The differential operator in the right-hand side of ([\ref=eq35]) represents the magnetic α  -  effect. The equation yields

[formula]

Magnetic α  -  effect is insignificant in the leading order, if the means [formula] exist and as a result 〈1〉h is well-defined by ([\ref=Malpha]). The condition of insignificance of the magnetic α  -  effect is stronger than the solvability condition 〈〈h〉〉h  =   for the equation [formula], which follows from ([\ref=eq11p2]) and in the case of (A.2) for n = 1 is

[formula]

If the perturbed CHM state is steady or periodic in time, the 4K scalar relations ([\ref=eq34]) are sufficient for insignificance of kinematic α  -  effect, and the K scalar relations ([\ref=eq37]) are sufficient for insignificance of the magnetic α  -  effect. Elementary algebra shows, that these conditions hold true for k = 1,2,5:

[formula]

If the CHM regime [formula] has a symmetry considered in Zh08, then ([\ref=eq34]) and ([\ref=eq37]) are satisfied for all k, and thus the AKA- and magnetic α  -  effects are insignificant in the leading order. If the symmetry is spatial (i.e. the time shift [formula] is zero), then [formula] for all k  ≤  K = 4; if it is spatio-temporal, then for all k  ≤  4 [formula] and [formula] satisfies the same relation (see the proof in Zh08, Section 7); the remaining vector fields [formula] for k = 5 satisfy [formula], and hence [formula] also satisfy the latter relation.

The terms [formula] in ([\ref=eq39]) and [formula] in ([\ref=Malpha]) are not problematic, because [formula] and [formula] exponentially decay and thus the means [formula] and [formula] are well-defined. The quantities [formula], [formula] and [formula] also decay exponentially (see Zh08, Appendix D).

The multiscale approach remains feasible even, if ([\ref=eq34]) and/or ([\ref=eq37]) do not hold true. It is well-known (see Dubrulle and Frisch 1991), that in this case another slow time scale is appropriate, T = εt. Then the new term ∂〈0〉h  /  ∂T emerging in the left-hand side of ([\ref=eq35]) balances the magnetic α  -  effect term. Then equations ([\ref=eq30]) and ([\ref=eq35]), supplemented by ([\ref=eqtimedep]) (see the next section) if the CHM regime [formula] is unsteady, constitute a closed system of linear first-order PDE's (together with the solenoidality conditions ([\ref=eq17p1]), for n = 0 for the mean magnetic field, and for n = 1 for the flow ([\ref=avev1]) also derived in the next section; in view of ([\ref=avom1]), ([\ref=eqtimedep]) and ([\ref=avev1]) are not affected by the change in the time scaling). This system turns out to be mixed: while ([\ref=eq35]) is an evolutionary equation, ([\ref=eq30]) and ([\ref=eqtimedep]) are not. Solutions to such systems generically exhibit unbounded exponential growth. (Multiscale expansion can yield amplitude equations, where the α  -  effect coexists together with the molecular diffusivity and the nonlinear advection, but this requires construction of the asymptotic expansion along a different line in the parameter space. For instance, Frisch et al., 1987, obtained such mean-flow equations for perturbations of flows in a hydrodynamic weakly nonlinear stability problem in the limit of small Reynolds numbers R, assuming that the scale ratios were linked to R.) Consequently, from now on we focus on a potentially more interesting case of insignificant α  -  effect, where possible growth of perturbations may saturate due to nonlinearity.

Assuming that the AKA- and magnetic α  -  effects are insignificant, in this section we solve equations (A.1)-(A.3) for n = 1.

Step [formula] for n = 1. To apply the solvability conditions ([\ref=solveomega])-([\ref=solves]), this system must be transformed to take the form of the problem (). Thus, the gradient parts of [formula] and [formula], and the mean part of [formula] must be isolated. These quantities can be found using ([\ref=eq30r]), ([\ref=eq17p2])-([\ref=eq17p5]) for n = 1, ([\ref=avom1]) and ([\ref=eq23]):

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

and [formula] are globally bounded solutions to Neumann problems

[formula]

[formula]

Consequently, [formula] and [formula] satisfy the same boundary conditions, as [formula] and [formula], respectively.

Step [formula] for n = 1. Upon substitution of (), equations (A.1)-(A.3) for n = 1 take the form

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Solvability condition ([\ref=solveomega]) is clearly verified for (), and [formula] can be determined from ([\ref=vprime]). Condition ([\ref=solveh]) yields expression ([\ref=Malpha]) for 〈1〉h (see Section 6).

Step [formula] for n = 1. Scalar multiplying () by [formula], j = 1,2, using their biorthogonality to [formula] and normalisation ([\ref=norm125]), and employing ([\ref=eq23]), ([\ref=avevI]) and the identity

[formula]

obtained by "uncurling" the vorticity component of ([\ref=eq20]), we find

[formula]

where it is denoted

[formula]

and [formula] are 7-dimensional vector fields:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula] for m < k, [formula] for m = k, and [formula] for m > k. If the perturbed CHM regime [formula] possesses a symmetry considered in Zh08, vector fields [formula] for k  ≤  4 are symmetric, [formula] for k = 1,2 are antisymmetric, and thereby 〈〈1〉〉h  =  , if [formula] is a steady CHM state.

If the CHM regime [formula] is unsteady, scalar multiplication of () by [formula], with the use of its orthogonality to [formula], k = 1,2 and normalisation ([\ref=norm125]), yields

[formula]

where

[formula]

All the solvability conditions for () have been satisfied, and thus a solution can be constructed.

Step [formula] for n = 1. Let [formula] denote the projection of a vector field[formula] to the subspace, orthogonal to ker M* (in the sense of the scalar product [formula] ). If the CHM state [formula] is unsteady and symmetric, application of [formula] amounts to projecting out the [formula] component, since the right-hand sides in () are symmetric, and [formula] is the only symmetric eigenmode in ker M*. In view of relations ([\ref=eq23]) and ([\ref=avevI]), and due to linearity of this problem, it has the following solution:

[formula]

[formula]

Here [formula] solve auxiliary problems of type II:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Vector fields [formula] solve auxiliary problems of type III:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

([formula] for m > k).

Vector fields [formula] solve auxiliary problems of type IV:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

([formula] for i > j).

Finally, [formula] solve the problem

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula] and [formula] must satisfy the boundary conditions ([\ref=eq2SF])-([\ref=eq2EC]) and ([\ref=eq4T]). Spatial means of their horizontal flow components and of vertical vorticity components must vanish, as well as spatio-temporal means of horizontal magnetic components.

Together, ([\ref=eq44sol]), ([\ref=eq49]), ([\ref=eq52]) and ([\ref=eq53sol]) are equivalent to ([\ref=eq17p2])-([\ref=eq17p5]) for n = 1. It suffices to impose these conditions for the vorticity and magnetic parts of a solution at t = 0 (this can be deduced taking the divergence of the vorticity and magnetic equations of the problems ()-() ). Equations ([\ref=eq44p3]), ([\ref=eq46p2]), ([\ref=eq50p2]) and ([\ref=eq53p3]) are equivalent to ([\ref=eq30r]) for n = 1.

The spatial means of the initial conditions for these problems can be determined integrating the equations for vorticity and magnetic perturbations and considering the spatio-temporal means of the results:

[formula]

[formula]

(the means exist by the assumption that the magnetic α  -  effect is insignificant); at any [formula]

[formula]

Averaging the magnetic part of ([\ref=eq43]), we obtain

[formula]

Now initial conditions for the problem () can be determined from ([\ref=eq43]) and () at t = 0.

The choice of initial data must ensure that all solutions to the auxiliary problems are globally bounded with their derivatives. Any solution is globally bounded for any smooth initial conditions, if the perturbed CHM state [formula] is space-periodic and linearly stable to small-scale perturbations (see Appendix B in Zh08). Modification of initial conditions for [formula], [formula] and [formula] into other permissible ones implies the respective changes in initial conditions for [formula]. These changes must belong to the stable manifold of the perturbed CHM state [formula], so that the resultant changes in solutions to the auxiliary problems and in [formula] decay exponentially in fast time.

Since [formula] decay exponentially in fast time together with derivatives (see Section 4), the right-hand sides of equations () also do. If the CHM state [formula] is linearly stable to small-scale perturbations, this implies that [formula] decay exponentially, and any changes in [formula], [formula] and [formula] due to a permissible variation of the initial data for [formula] also exponentially decay (see Zh08, Appendix B). Otherwise, exponential decay of [formula] must be ensured by an appropriate choice of the initial data.

If the CHM regime [formula] is steady or periodic in time and periodic in spatial variables, generically one can find [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula], which are steady or have the same periodicity, respectively (see Section 4 in Zh08). If the perturbed CHM regime has a symmetry of the kind considered in Zh08, [formula] are antisymmetric sets, except for [formula], which is a symmetric set of vector fields for non-steady regimes. Consequently, [formula], [formula] and [formula] are then symmetric sets for k < 5 (by construction the antisymmetric part of any permissible solution to the problems ()-() for k < 5 exponentially decays and hence is irrelevant), as well as [formula]; [formula] and [formula] are antisymmetric sets. For symmetric sets conditions ([\ref=EQbegin0]) and ([\ref=EQbegin2]) are automatically satisfied (except for the mean of the vertical component of vorticity, vanishing of which is not implied by parity invariance of the perturbed state). If the perturbed CHM state is steady or its symmetry is without a time shift, the right-hand sides of auxiliary problems () are zero and hence [formula].

[formula] are coefficients of the second-order operators representing the so-called anisotropic combined eddy diffusivity correction. [formula] are coefficients of pseudodifferential operators, formally also of the second order, which can be regarded as representing an unconventional non-local anisotropic combined eddy diffusivity correction. All [formula], if the perturbed CHM state is steady or possesses a symmetry considered in Zh08 without a time shift. [formula] are coefficients of quadratic terms representing the so-called combined eddy advection correction.

Equations ([\ref=eq59]) and ([\ref=eq62]) are solvability conditions for the systems (A.1)-(A.3) for n = 2 and 3. Together with ([\ref=eqtimedep]), if the CHM regime [formula] is unsteady, they constitute a closed system of equations for the leading terms of mean perturbations (note that c0,k + 2  =  〈〈0〉〉k, k = 1,2, since [formula]). The vertical component of ([\ref=eq62]) and the horizontal component of ([\ref=eq59]) vanish identically (i.e., ([\ref=eq62]) represents two scalar equations and ([\ref=eq59]) just one).

Unlike for forced CHM systems, the system of amplitude equations is mixed, involving both evolutionary and non-evolutionary equations in slow variables. Equation ([\ref=eq62]) for the mean magnetic field perturbation is evolutionary. It preserves solenoidality of the mean magnetic perturbation (condition ([\ref=eq17p1]) for n = 0) in slow spatial variables, which therefore becomes just a constraint for the initial condition. Equation ([\ref=eq59]) resulting from the vorticity equation does not bear any similarity with the original equation - both the derivative in slow time and molecular diffusivity operator are absent. Equation ([\ref=eqtimedep]), emerging if the CHM regime [formula] is unsteady, is also non-evolutionary, as well as the condition of solenoidality in slow variables ([\ref=eq17p1]) for the mean flow 〈〈1〉〉h ([\ref=avev1]). The system of amplitude equations is still underdetermined, if the CHM state is steady and possesses the symmetries considered in Zh08, resulting in 〈〈1〉〉h  =  . The missing equation is then the condition of solenoidality in slow variables of the mean flow 〈2〉h.

In this section we calculate 〈2〉h for a steady CHM state [formula], which is parity-invariant or symmetric about a vertical axis. In this case, in view of ([\ref=avom1]), ([\ref=eq39]), ([\ref=avevI]), ([\ref=avev1]) and ([\ref=eq19]) for n = 0 and 1,

[formula]

This is not an independent calculation - we advance by two steps in solution of the system (A.1)-(A.3) for n = 2, following the general procedure for treatment of the systems in the hierarchy that is outlined in the end of Section 3 (although the solution itself is not required for our purposes).

Step [formula] for n = 2. We need to apply solvability conditions ([\ref=solves]) to equations (A.1)-(A.3) for n = 2. To do this, we transform the system to fit the form of the problem () by isolating the gradient parts of [formula] and [formula], and the mean part of [formula] using ([\ref=eq30r]), ([\ref=eq17p2])-([\ref=eq17p5]) for n = 2 and ([\ref=eq43]):

Thus, for a steady CHM state possessing a symmetry which guarantees insignificance of the α  -  effect, the missing amplitude equation - the solenoidality condition for the flow ([\ref=avev2]) - has been expressed in the terms of the amplitudes c0,k.

It has been found in Section 5 that unless the horizontal part of the mean flow perturbation vanishes, no solution of order ε0 equations ([\ref=Morder1]) exists in the functional space D (introduced in Section 4). We discuss here the possibility of relaxing the condition that the solution belongs to D.

Direct substitution demonstrates that ([\ref=Morder1]) has a solution

[formula]

It satisfies all the conditions for vector fields in D, except for it is not uniformly bounded in the fast time t. (Other solutions to ([\ref=Morder1]) can be constructed, allowing their linear growth in horizontal directions, but they seem too unphysical.)

If growing in time solutions are regarded as acceptable, further application of the asymptotic techniques does not require considering dependence of the perturbation ([\ref=pertser]) on the slow time T. Construction of an expansion of large-scale solutions to the problem () in power series becomes more straightforward. At each order εn one proceeds in two steps: 1. Calculate 〈n + 1〉v and 〈n〉h using (A.4) at order εn + 1. 2. Find [formula] and θn integrating in time t the system (A.1)-(A.3) at order εn.

For the sake of simplicity, suppose that the CHM state [formula] is steady and periodic in horizontal directions. Then the system (A.1)-(A.3) can be solved expanding the unknown fields [formula] in a series in eigenfunctions of the operator of linearisation of the original equations, L, which is an elliptic operator (not involving the derivative in time). If the steady CHM state is stable to short-scale perturbations, all eigenvalues of this operator have non-positive real parts. The coefficients of the expansion are accessed by scalar multiplication of the system by the biorthogonal eigenfunctions of the adjoint operator. By virtue of ([\ref=tgrow]), the zero-order terms [formula] grow linearly in time. As a result, [formula] experience a polynomial growth in time, the degree of the polynomial being 2n + 1.

Thus, free convection is apparently unstable to large-scale perturbations with a non-zero mean flow. However, this is not a genuine instability, but rather variation (at a given point in space) of the profile of the perturbed CHM fields [formula] due to advection by the mean flow 〈〈0〉〉h. Were this mean flow constant, one could rely on the Galilean invariance to achieve 〈〈0〉〉h  =  , i.e., to overcome the difficulty by considering the problem in the comoving coordinate system. (Note that the solution ([\ref=tgrow]) to the order ε0 problem ([\ref=Morder1]) represents the second term in the Taylor expansion in time of the fields [formula] transported by the flow 〈〈0〉〉h.) It is conceivable that a similar transformation modifies the present weakly stability problem into one solvable in D, but dependence of 〈〈0〉〉h on slow variables makes the new problem significantly harder, than the problem considered here.

We have investigated, in the Boussinesq approximation, weakly nonlinear stability to large-scale perturbations of a convective hydromagnetic regime [formula] in a horizontal layer rotating about a vertical axis. We have assumed that the CHM system is free, i.e., there are no source terms in the governing equations () and boundary conditions (). Such system is translation invariant in space and time. We have derived expressions for the α  -  effect tensors ([\ref=alome]) and ([\ref=alh]). If the CHM regime is symmetric about a vertical axis with a time shift, or parity invariant with a time shift, the α  -  effect tensors do not contribute to the leading order amplitude equations, i.e. the α  -  effect is insignificant in the leading order. Applying the homogenisation techniques within the approach developed in Zh08, under the assumption that the α  -  effect is insignificant in the leading order (because of the symmetries or otherwise) we have derived a system of amplitude equations, ([\ref=eq59]) and ([\ref=eq62]), augmented by ([\ref=eqtimedep]) if the perturbed CHM regime is non-steady. This system, governing the evolution of large-scale perturbations in slow time, is closed, when considered together with the condition of solenoidality in slow spatial variables of the leading term of expansion of the mean flow perturbation. In a generic α  -  effect-free setup, this is the condition of solenoidality of the flow ([\ref=avev1]). If the CHM state is steady and possesses a symmetry guaranteeing insignificance of the α  -  effect, 〈〈1〉〉h  =   and this condition becomes trivially satisfied; then the remaining amplitude equation is the solenoidality condition ([\ref=eq17p1]) for the flow ([\ref=avev2]).

Similarly to the case of forced thermal hydromagnetic convection, which was studied in Zh08, the system of amplitude equations involves a linear operator of combined eddy diffusivity correction and a quadratic operator of anisotropic combined eddy advection. Generalised diffusivity correction is described by non-local pseudodifferential operators, formally of the second order, like the standard diffusivity. All the operators are anisotropic. No similarity of amplitude equations for free CHM regimes and mean-field equations for forced CHM regimes is observed beyond this point: Because of the differences in the structure of the kernels of the operators of linearisation in the vicinity of the perturbed regime in the two cases, the system of amplitude equations that we have obtained here does not involve mean flow perturbation, and it is mixed. Whereas equation ([\ref=eq62]) for the mean magnetic perturbation is evolutionary, like it is for forced convection, the remaining ones, ([\ref=eq59]) and ([\ref=eqtimedep]), involve neither time derivatives, nor molecular diffusivity operators. If the CHM state is steady and possesses a symmetry guaranteeing insignificance of the α  -  effect, the solenoidality condition for the flow ([\ref=avev2]) reduces to a non-evolutionary third-order partial differential equation with a cubic nonlinearity.

As already mentioned above, the neutral linear stability modes [formula] and [formula] exist for free CHM regimes for any combination of physically sound boundary conditions because of the spatial and temporal invariance of the CHM regime [formula]. This opens a possibility of a similar analysis of linear or weakly nonlinear stability of CHM regimes for boundary conditions different from the ones considered here. For instance, it is feasible for electrically conducting fluid contained in a horizontal rotating layer confined between half-spaces of dielectric material with isothermal no slip boundaries, when the collection of neutral modes is the smallest one - for generic sets of parameter values it is comprised of the three above-mentioned modes. Note that a direct application of this approach to the study of stability of forced convection fails for these boundary conditions.

It is possible to perform the same analysis for branches of CHM regimes emerging from symmetric ones near Hopf and pitchfork bifurcations, like it was done in Zh08 for forced CHM regimes. New α  -  effect terms emerge in the amplitude equations for the evolution of large-scale perturbations in stability analysis of regimes near the point of a symmetry-breaking Hopf bifurcation, and an additional amplitude equation involving cubic nonlinearity emerges in stability analysis for regimes emerging in a symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcation. Since the derivations, although quite straightforward, are very technical, we have not carried out them here.

We have not prescribed any boundary conditions for the amplitude equations, since this would not affect our derivations. The basic requirement is that the perturbation is globally bounded - this is the logical foundation for application of asymptotic methods employed here. In computations it is natural to assume periodicity of the amplitudes in slow variables. Results of a numerical study of large-scale perturbations under this condition, for a class of CHM regimes symmetric about the vertical axis and stable to short-scale perturbations, will be reported in a sequel to the present paper.
