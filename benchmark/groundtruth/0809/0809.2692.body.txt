Proper motions with Subaru I. Methods and a first sample in the Subaru Deep Field

Introduction

The basic structure of our Milky Way galaxy seems clear: a thin disk of young stars, gas and dust circles the center quietly, immersed within a thicker disk of older stars. Both disks sit inside a nearly spherical halo of very old, metal-poor stars which do not share the overall rotation of the disks. Surrounding everything is an extended distribution of dark matter. Our knowledge of the details within this big picture, on the other hand, is not so clear. Recent large-scale projects, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, have measured the properties of high-luminosity stars throughout the halo (see, for example, [\cite=Yanny2000], and [\cite=Juric2008]), while the rapid development of infrared detectors has allowed projects such as the Two Micron All Sky Survey ([\cite=Skrutskie2006]) and Spitzer Space Telescope ([\cite=Patel2004]) to pierce the dusty disks and measure the properties of their stars. Nonetheless, some portions of the Milky Way remain largely unexplored.

In particular, we know little of the low-mass, low-luminosity stars of the halo. The white dwarfs and metal-poor subdwarfs of the halo glow so faintly, from so great a distance, that they are rarely seen and more rarely recognized. As a recent review ([\cite=Reid2005]) points out, however, these shy and elusive stars may dominate the microlensing events observed towards the Galactic bulge and the Magellanic Clouds.

There are two ways to search for these stars: cover a very large area on the sky to a shallow depth, or use a "pencil-beam" survey to examine a tiny region much more deeply. The first approach (see, for example, [\cite=Oppenheimer2001] and [\cite=Carollo2006]) will find objects in many directions, but only out to a small distance from the Sun; the second approach (see, for example, [\cite=Mendez2002], [\cite=Nelson2002], and [\cite=Kalirai2004]) probes farther into the halo, but only in a specific direction. One way to characterize surveys is to combine their area with the distance out to which they would detect some specific star to generate an "effective volume" for that type of star. In Table [\ref=table:survey_volume], we compare the projects mentioned above by this metric, using a star of absolute magnitude MV  =  16.5, appropriate for a cool white dwarf. We assumed a color (V - R)  =  0.5 to convert limiting magnitudes for R-based surveys to V-band.

Our project could be described as a "pencil-beam" survey, but it uses a very thick pencil. We examine images in the area of the Subaru Deep Field (SDF) ([\cite=Kashikawa2004]) acquired over a period of six years to search for moving objects. These images were acquired primarily to study high-redshift galaxies ([\cite=Nagao2004], [\cite=Shimasaku2006]), but have also been used to find high-redshift supernovae ([\cite=Poznanski2007]). The images are nearly as deep as those in some HST-based surveys, but cover a significantly wider area, yielding a large effective volume. We can refer to the SDF catalogs compiled by [\citet=Kashikawa2004] and [\citet=Richmond2005] for information on our candidates in multiple passbands (B, V, Rc, i' and z'). Unlike most other pencil-beam surveys, we have measurements at many epochs: our dataset contains images taken on 20 nights. We can therefore measure the proper motion of our candidates very well, and place strong constraints on the uncertainties in our measurements.

This paper is the first in a series on proper motions in several small fields studied with Subaru. We will concentrate on techniques, leaving detailed analysis of the results for later papers. In Section 2, we describe the observations, their reductions, and the combination of individual frames into a single combined image for each night. In Section 3, we walk through our procedure for finding moving objects, and discuss our criteria for separating good candidates from bogus ones; we end up with a first sample of stars which have very well measured proper motions. In Section 4, we compute the reduced proper motions for objects in this sample, and compare their properties to those of objects drawn from a simulated survey of our field. Finally, in Section 5, we list our plans for future work on this dataset, and in other fields with multiple epochs of deep Subaru imaging.

Astronomers at the Observatoire de Besanon have created a model of the stellar populations in the Milky Way ([\cite=Robin2003]) with a very convenient web-based interface. The model consists of four populations of stars - thin disk, thick disk, spheroid, outer bulge (the innermost portions of the Milky Way are poorly constrained) - plus white dwarfs added to each component separately. The parameters of each component are adjusted to produce the best fit to the observed stellar populations and their dynamics. Recent work by [\citet=Ibata2007] finds that the Besanon model does a very good job of reproducing observed star counts in two of three deep fields down to i0  =  24. Those authors criticized the Besanon populations for being too sharply defined, forcing them to smooth the model colors by small amounts (~  0.10 mag) in order to match observed color-magnitude diagrams. However, since our main concern is to classify objects very broadly using a mixture of kinematics, magnitudes and colors, we will adopt the Besanon model and use it as a reference throughout this paper to help us interpret properties of our sample.

Observations

The SDF is a region at high galactic latitude ([formula]) roughly half a degree on a side. [\citet=Kashikawa2004] describe very deep optical images taken with the Subaru 8.2-meter telescope and Suprime-Cam camera ([\cite=Miyazaki2002]). We investigated this region using a set of i'-band images with shorter exposure times. Table [\ref=table:journal] lists the date for all nights used in our analysis. Note that our images taken on 2003 April 30 had a shorter exposure time than the rest; since these images also had some of the worst seeing, we gave those measurements very little weight in the final proper motion calculations. We split the images taken on the night of 2006 May 3 into two sets and treated each independently, as if taken on different nights. Since the data taken on 2007 Feb 15 had the best seeing and the largest number of detected objects, we adopted it as the fiducial set for matching (see Section 3).

During each night of observing, we took a series of short (typically 180-second to 360-second) exposures, shifting the telescope position slightly to fill in small gaps between the ten CCDs on the focal plane. Using the SDFRED package ([\cite=Ouchi2004]) and NEKO software ([\cite=Yagi2002]), we followed the procedures described in section 4 of [\citet=Kashikawa2004] to turn all the raw frames taken during the night into a single, large mosaic. Briefly, we cleaned the raw images by subtracting a bias deduced from the overscan regions and dividing by a normalized flatfield frame made from a median of many night-time target images. Using the parameters derived in [\citet=Miyazaki2002], we corrected for optical distortions in the focal plane. Images from all chips were convolved to form a uniform point-spread function (PSF) across the entire array. We determined a sky background by calculating the local sky at a series of grid points spaced at intervals of roughly 51 arcseconds and using bi-linear interpolation between the grid points; we then subtracted this sky background from each image. We used stars shared by adjacent CCDs to determine the weights to use when combining data from individual images to make the final mosaic. The result for each night is one (or, in the case of 2006 May 3, two) large image covering the entire SDF.

The quality of final combined images varied from night to night. The Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) ranged from [formula] to [formula], but, since the plate scale was [formula] per pixel, no data was undersampled. The limiting magnitude also varied with the conditions, but was usually i'  ~  25.5.

Searching for candidates with proper motion

Selecting objects with proper motions from a set of images requires several steps: finding and measuring the properties of stars in individual images, matching stars found at different epochs, computing the change in position of each star over time, and deciding which changes are due to real movement. We will now describe these steps in detail.

In order to find star-like objects in each image, we used the "stars" program within the XVista package ([\cite=Treffers1989]). The position of each object was calculated by fitting a gaussian to the background-subtracted, intensity-weighted marginal sums in each direction (see [\citet=Stone1989] for details).

It is not crucial to separate stars from galaxies at this early stage, since we will later discard any objects which do not move significantly; therefore, we accepted any object with a sharp core, [formula], as a "star." The number of "stars" found each night ranged from about 20,000 to about 100,000, depending on the exposure time and seeing.

The Suprime-Cam field is wide enough that even small uncorrected distortions near the edge of the field might move the apparent position of a star enough from one epoch to the next to hide real, but small, proper motions. In order to reduce any residual distortions, we broke the field into smaller units we will call "sectors." Each sector is a square 1000  ×  1000 pixels, or 202  ×  202 arcseconds, on a side. We allowed a small overlap of 10 arcseconds between adjacent sectors so that stars near the edges would not be missed.

We designated one epoch, 2007 February 15, as "fiducial," to serve as the basis of our matching procedure. For every other image, we used the match package ([\cite=Droege2006]) to match the objects in each sector to objects in the corresponding sector of the fiducial image. In order to count as an initial match to the fiducial image, a star had to lie within [formula] of the position of an object in the fiducial frame; we imposed this limit in order to avoid spurious matches between unrelated objects. Given the six-year span of our survey, this places an upper limit of about [formula] per year on our proper motion candidates. We may increase this limit to look for fast-moving objects in the future. We will demonstrate later (see Figure [\ref=fig:pm_histogram]) that this requirement does not have a strong effect on the results.

There were typically three hundred to eight hundred pairs of matching items found within each sector. We transformed the (pixel) coordinates of each star to the (pixel) coordinates of the fiducial image in the following iterative manner. First, we used all the matched pairs in the sector to find the coefficients of a linear transformation

[formula]

via a least-squares technique. Next, we computed the residuals between the positions of the members of each pair in the fiducial coordinate system. We discarded pairs with large residuals; specifically, any pair with a residual more than 10 times the 35th percentile. We then went back to compute new coefficients of the linear transformation with the surviving pairs. We repeated this procedure three times in each sector. Ignoring a few sectors with very few objects, the mean residual difference in position for surviving items matched to the fiducial frame was [formula]. However, most of the objects contributing to this residual, like most of the objects in each image, are faint, and some of the matches are spurious. The uncertainties in the positions of bright objects are considerably smaller, as we will show below.

We performed trials using a cubic transformation between the two coordinate systems, but found that the residuals were not significantly smaller than those based on a linear transformation.

The final steps in our matching procedure were to discard duplicate entries for objects in the overlapping areas between sectors, and to discard any objects which appeared in fewer than five epochs. The result was a set of positions in the fiducial coordinate system for objects appearing in at least five epochs. In order to estimate the uncertainty in the calculated positions, we computed the mean position of each objects in each coordinate (row and col) and its standard deviation; we then discarded measurements more than two standard deviations from the mean and recalculated mean and standard deviation. As shown in the first two rows of Table [\ref=table:pos_uncert], the typical clipped standard deviation rose from [formula] for bright, unsaturated objects to [formula] for faint objects.

In order to create a sample of objects for which proper motions could be measured accurately, we selected all objects which appeared in the fiducial image and at least four others. A total of 79605 objects satisfied this requirement. Faint objects were less likely to be selected, since they might not be detected on nights with poor seeing. In order to check the completeness of this sample as a function of magnitude, we inserted a set of 1000 artificial stars with magnitudes ranging from 21  <  i'  <  27 into the images. We then re-analyzed the entire set of images as before. Figure [\ref=fig:completeness] shows the fraction of artificial stars which were detected and placed into the sample for further study. Since the fraction falls to 50% at i'≃25.5, we estimate that our search may be considered complete to that magnitude.

We subjected this sample to a round of tests. For each coordinate, row and column, we made a linear fit to position as a function of Julian Date. Our fitting routine, following [\citet=Press1992], provides values for the the slope b of this line, the 95 percent confidence interval ci in the value of the slope, and the scatter sx around the line. The scatter is another estimate of the one-dimensional uncertainty in the position of a single measurement; we show its values in the lower rows of Table [\ref=table:pos_uncert].

In order to verify that our fitting method yields both the correct motion and an appropriate uncertainty, we ran a Monte Carlo simulation. For each integer magnitude between 21  <  i'  <  25, and for each value of 1-D annual proper motion [formula], we created 100 artificial stars. For each star, we drew 15 epochs randomly from our list of observations (see Table [\ref=table:journal]), and computed a set of positions, using the true proper motion plus some random error in each direction drawn from a gaussian distribution consistent with our measurements of sx for the given magnitude. We then submitted this list of simulated positions to our fitting routines, and compared their results to the true proper motions. We found that over this entire range of magnitudes and motions, our estimates for the proper motion and its uncertainty were accurate.

Next, we computed a significance of the slope for each coordinate:

[formula]

Choosing objects based on the significance of their motion in one direction alone would discriminate against objects moving diagonally across the CCD, which was aligned with the equatorial coordinate system. Therefore, we combined the significance values to create an unbiased measure of motion, [formula].

We expect that real proper motions should show an asymmetry, due to the relative motions around the galactic center of the Sun and the stars in the SDF, while spurious motions due to random errors in position measurements should be the same in all directions. In the upper panel of Figure [\ref=fig:significance], we plot the observed motions of objects with motions of low significance; they are distributed around zero with circular symmetry. On the other hand, objects with highly significant motions (shown in the lower panel of Figure [\ref=fig:significance]) are biased towards the south-east. The observed asymmetry matches that of the stars in a simulation made with the Besanon model (the motions of which we have scaled appropriately).

For the sample discussed below, we selected objects with Stot  ≥  5.0. Note that since our definition of S is based on a 95-percent confidence interval, corresponding to two standard deviations for a normal distribution, our criterion could be described as "motion at the 10-sigma level." Selecting objects based on the Stot statistic introduces a bias against objects with small proper motions. We investigated the nature of this bias by adding artificial stars with a range of proper motions into our images, analyzing the images as before, and comparing the output properties of the artificial stars to their input values. In Figure [\ref=fig:moving_signif], we show the fraction of artificial stars which had measured motions of high enough significance to be included in our proper motion sample. For bright stars, the fraction drops to 50% at a total proper motion of about [formula] per year.

We found that 110 objects passed this test. However, upon visually inspecting each candidate, we discovered that in five cases, the motions were due to a blend of two nearby stars, or a star mixed with the light of a background galaxy. That left a set of 105 candidates with real motions at a high significance. The median number of epochs of measurement for these objects was 19, and only 2 stars had fewer than 15 epochs. We show an example of the motions for one of these candidates in Figure [\ref=fig:fitted_motion].

How accurate are the derived motions? Using our set of artificial stars again, we computed a fractional error E based on the one-dimensional motion of stars in row and column directions separately.

[formula]

We included a constant [formula] per year to prevent division by zero. Figure [\ref=fig:fractional_errors] shows the median value of E as a function of input proper motion for stars of different magnitudes. The fractional error reaches 10% for proper motions of about [formula] per year.

Let us turn back to the real stars in the SDF. Figure [\ref=fig:pm_histogram] shows that the distribution of proper motions among stars in our sample has a peak at [formula] per year, which is (not coincidentally) the point at which the efficiency of detecting motion falls to 50%. The largest motions we found are about [formula] per year, which is far less than the limit of [formula] per year set by our matching procedure. We conclude that our matching requirement - that each measurement lie within [formula] of its match in the fiducial epoch - does not have a strong effect on the resulting proper motions.

Some of the analysis described below requires the color of an object, in order to distinguish different types of star. We chose the (V - I) color for several reasons: it samples a wide range of wavelengths, avoids B-band measurements which are hard to make for cool stars, is often used in studies of galactic structure, and is commonly tabulated in models of stellar properties. Since we used i'-band images to search for motions, all the candidates had good i'-band magnitudes; we will convert them to the standard Cousins I system in the next paragraph. However, many of the candidates grow faint in images taken at shorter wavelengths. We inspected each candidate in deep SDF images ([\cite=Kashikawa2004]) taken in B, V and RC passbands, and compared its appearance in those images to the B, V and RC magnitudes listed for each object in the SDF catalogs. In six cases, the V-band measurement was clearly incorrect, sometimes due to confusion with a brighter object nearby; the number of improper magnitudes was much larger in B-band. Removing these six objects from our sample, we are left with a set of 99 stars which have well measured proper motions and good magnitudes in V, RC, i' and z'. We call this our "first sample." We list these candidates in Table [\ref=table:sample].

Before we can compare our measurements to models of galactic structure, we need to convert the Suprime-Cam i' magnitudes, which are calibrated on the AB system ( [\cite=Fukugita1996]; [\cite=Miyazaki2002]; [\cite=Kashikawa2004]), to I magnitudes, which are on the standard Johnson-Cousins system. We used synthetic photometry to find the relationship between the Suprime-Cam (Vs  -  i') and Johnson-Cousins (V - I), taking bandpasses from [\citet=Miyazaki2002] and [\citet=Bessell1990], respectively. We selected main sequence stars, O5V to M6V, from the library of [\citet=Pickles1998], stars ranging in metallicity  - 2  ≤  [Fe   /   H]  ≤  0 from models of [\citet=Lejeune1997], and flux-calibrated spectra of white dwarfs observed by the SDSS ([\cite=Adelman-McCarthy2008]). We convolved each spectrum with the Suprime-Cam passbands and with the Johnson-Cousins passbands to compute synthetic magnitudes, and used the spectrum of Vega from [\citet=Bohlin2004] to set the zeropoints to the values given in [\citet=Fukugita1996]. We found that the following linear relationship fit the data well, yielding a scatter of less than 0.03 mag across the range of colors - 0.3  <  (V  -  I)  <  3.5:

[formula]

We use this equation to convert the observed colors for stars in the SDF to Johnson-Cousins (V - I) when comparing our results to stellar models.

Simple analysis of the first sample

We begin with the Besanon model. We generated 10 simulated catalogs of objects in the area of the SDF, using the parameters found by [\citet=Robin2003] and including stars down to an apparent magnitude of V  =  30. We applied cuts to the synthetic catalogs to match the combined limits of the i'-band proper motion images and the SDF catalogs.

[formula]

The result should be a set of stars similar to those in the actual SDF, though ten times more numerous. The large size of this synthetic sample will make it easier to delineate sparsely populated regions in the reduced proper motion diagram, to which we now turn.

Reduced proper motion was introduced by [\citet=Luyten1922] as a way to separate stars of different luminosities using only the observable apparent magnitude, m, and proper motion, μ, in units of arcseconds per year. We will base our reduced proper motion on V-band magnitudes, so that

[formula]

It is also possible to express this quantity in terms of a star's absolute magnitude, M, and tangential velocity, vt, expressed in units of km/s,

[formula]

Using this version of the formula, we compute HV for stars in the simulated catalogs produced from the Besanon model. Figure [\ref=fig:reduced_besancon] shows the reduced proper motion as a function of (V - I) color. We assigned objects in the simulation to three populations based on their metallicity and the component of their space velocity in the direction of galactic rotation, which we denote as vgr to avoid confusion with the passband V.

if vgr  <   - 130 km  /  s and   <   - 1.20, we assign the star to the halo

if vgr  >   - 60 km  /  s and   >   - 0.50, we assign the star to the thin disk

otherwise, we assign the star to the thick disk

Stars from different populations appear in distinct regions in this diagram. We have drawn rough outlines by hand to aid the reader in recognizing the populations.

Note that there is a clear "red edge" in the distribution of WDs, at a color of (V - I)  ~  1.4. Theoretical models of cooling WDs ([\cite=Richer2000]; [\cite=Chabrier2000]) indicate that at an age of about 10 Gyr and a temperature of Teff  ~  5000 K, an increase in opacity due to molecular hydrogen causes the (V - I) color to shift back to the blue as the star continues to cool. WDs with atmospheres dominated by other elements, such as helium or carbon, would continue to grow redder as they cool. Objects near the bottom of the WD region are likely to be members of the halo.

In Figure [\ref=fig:reduced_sdf], we present the reduced proper motions for the real stars in our first sample. We must switch to the first form of reduced proper motion, Equation 7, to compute HV for the observed stars. To facilitate comparison with the Besanon model, we include the hand-drawn regions from Figure [\ref=fig:reduced_besancon] as well as all objects from the simulated catalogs as tiny points. Note that the saturation of very bright stars [formula] in the Subaru images, plus our limited ability to measure proper motions [formula] per year, combine to eliminate any candidates with reduced proper motions [formula]. In the discussion which follows, please recall that the boundaries of the regions drawn in the diagram are only approximations intended to provide rough classifications; the number of items within each region could change by ten or twenty percent if one shifted the boundaries slightly.

Our 99 proper motion (PM) candidates divide into four groups: 9 fall inside the WD region, 43 inside the halo region, 23 in the disk region, and 24 lie in an area which had no stars in the Besanon model. Let us discuss the WD candidates first, and then consider the objects in the "empty" area.

The PM candidates falling into the WD region are concentrated near the red edge of the region, just as models of WD cooling predict. We take the combined results for ten simulated catalogs generated from the Besanon model, correct for completeness as a function of magnitude and proper motion, based on our tests with artificial stars (see Figure [\ref=fig:moving_signif]), and divide by 10 to find predictions of 2.2 WDs in the halo, 5.9 in the thick disk and 0.7 in the thin disk, for a total of 8.8 WDs satisfying our selection criteria in the SDF. Our sample yields 9 candidates in this region, consistent with the model. Note that several candidates lie just outside the WD region; we must make additional measurements of these objects before we can make any confident claim about the exact number of WDs. Which of our candidates are most likely to be members of the halo? As a young WD cools, it slides diagonally down and to the right on this diagram, parallel to the lower envelope of the simulation's objects. Due to their high velocities, halo WDs should lie near the bottom of the distribution. There are several candidates at some distance below the main locus of simulation objects; we believe the two at HV  =  23.0 and HV  =  24.2 are the most likely of our candidates to be halo dwars.

Roughly one-quarter of our PM candidates lie in an "empty" region between the simulation's WD and halo stars. Since we drew the boundaries by hand, they may certainly be shifted by small amounts; that would cause a number of the anamolous objects to fall within the halo or WD regions. However, some of our candidates are more than one magnitude away from any population in the simulations. Is it possible that they may be ordinary stars reddened by dust? According to [\citet=Schlegel1998], dust along the line of sight through the SDF should produce E(B - V)  =  0.015 mag; the corresponding extinction, AV  =  0.051 and AI  =  0.030, is too small to shift candidates a significant distance in the reduced PM diagram. We suggest that these objects may be metal-poor subdwarfs in the halo, a class of star which is not included in the Besanon model. If we make an HR diagram using MV and (V - I), we find that the halo stars in the Besanon model cross the disk main sequence in the range 1.5  <  (V - I)  <  3.0, and are slightly more luminous in the redder portion of this range. However, as [\citet=Reid1998] show, extremely metal-poor subdwarfs are much fainter than disk stars in this color range, by up to 4 magnitudes. Stars with these photometric properties and halo kinematics would lie several magnitudes below the halo region drawn in our diagrams. We therefore tentatively identify as extremely metal-poor halo stars the PM candidates which fall far from the WD and halo regions.

Future work

Our first step will be to acquire spectra of some of our PM candidates to verify their identity as WDs and metal-poor subdwarfs. After we have spectra for a good fraction of our candidates, we can assign types to the candidates with more confidence. At that point, we will make a more detailed and quantitative comparison of the WDs in our sample with those expected from models of the Milky Way.

We can also look at candidates with motions of somewhat lower significance. In this paper, we examined the 110 stars which had Stot  >  5.0. There were 72 stars with 4.0  ≤  Stot  <  5.0, and they show nearly the same degree of asymmetry in their motions as our first sample. It is likely that a significant number of these stars have real proper motions. However, it will take extra effort to distinguish them from the growing number of false detections, and to check their photometry (many of them are fainter than the stars in our sample). As we sift through this set of stars with less significant motions, we can also try to improve the B and V measurements of our stars, so that we will not discard so many candidates due to their uncertain colors.

Finally, we can apply the same techniques to find stars with large proper motions in other deep fields with multiple visits by Subaru. Our next target will be the area of the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey ([\cite=Sekiguchi2004], [\cite=Furusawa2008]), which is roughly in the opposite direction from the SDF. We can use it to check our results in the SDF, but also to look for differences predicted by models of galactic populations.
