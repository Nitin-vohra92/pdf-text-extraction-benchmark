Magnetic dilaton strings in anti-de Sitter spaces

Introduction

The construction and analysis of black hole solutions in the background of anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces is a subject of much recent interest. This interest is primarily motivated by the correspondence between the gravitating fields in an AdS spacetime and conformal field theory living on the boundary of the AdS spacetime [\cite=Witt1]. This equivalence enables one to remove the divergences of the action and conserved quantities of gravity in the same way as one does in field theory. It was argued that the thermodynamics of black holes in AdS spaces can be identified with that of a certain dual conformal field theory (CFT) in the high temperature limit [\cite=Witt2]. Having the AdS/CFT correspondence idea at hand, one can gain some insights into thermodynamic properties and phase structures of strong 't Hooft coupling conformal field theories by studying the thermodynamics of asymptotically AdS black holes.

On another front, scalar coupled black hole solutions with different asymptotic spacetime structure is a subject of interest for a long time. There has been a renewed interest in such studies ever since new black hole solutions have been found in the context of string theory. The low energy effective action of string theory contains two massless scalars namely dilaton and axion. The dilaton field couples in a nontrivial way to other fields such as gauge fields and results into interesting solutions for the background spacetime. It was argued that with the exception of a pure cosmological constant, no dilaton-de Sitter or anti-de Sitter black hole solution exists with the presence of only one Liouville-type dilaton potential [\cite=MW]. Recently, the dilaton potential leading to (anti)-de Sitter-like solutions of dilaton gravity has been found [\cite=Gao1]. It was shown that the cosmological constant is coupled to the dilaton in a very nontrivial way. With the combination of three Liouville-type dilaton potentials, a class of static dilaton black hole solutions in (A)dS spaces has been obtained by using a coordinates transformation which recast the solution in the schwarzschild coordinates system [\cite=Gao1]. More recently, a class of charged rotating dilaton black string solutions in four-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime has been found in [\cite=shey1]. Other studies on the dilaton black hole solutions in (A)dS spaces have been carried out in [\cite=Gao2] [\cite=shey2].

In this Letter, we turn to the investigation of asymptotically AdS spacetimes generated by static and spinning string sources in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory which are horinzonless and have nontrivial external solutions. The motivation for studying such kinds of solutions is that they may be interpreted as cosmic strings. Cosmic strings are topological structure that arise from the possible phase transitions to which the universe might have been subjected to and may play an important role in the formation of primordial structures. A short review of papers treating this subject follows. The four-dimensional horizonless solutions of Einstein gravity have been explored in [\cite=Vil] [\cite=Ban]. These horizonless solutions [\cite=Vil] [\cite=Ban] have a conical geometry; they are everywhere flat except at the location of the line source. The spacetime can be obtained from the flat spacetime by cutting out a wedge and identifying its edges. The wedge has an opening angle which turns to be proportional to the source mass. The extension to include the Maxwell field has also been done [\cite=Bon]. Static and spinning magnetic sources in three and four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell gravity with negative cosmological constant have been explored in [\cite=Lem1] [\cite=Lem2]. The generalization of these asymptotically AdS magnetic rotating solutions to higher dimensions has also been done [\cite=Deh2]. In the context of electromagnetic cosmic string, it has been shown that there are cosmic strings, known as superconducting cosmic strings, that behave as superconductors and have interesting interactions with astrophysical magnetic fields [\cite=Wit2]. The properties of these superconducting cosmic strings have been investigated in [\cite=Moss]. It is also of great interest to generalize the study to the dilaton gravity theory [\cite=Fer]. While exact magnetic rotating dilaton solution in three dimensions has been obtained in [\cite=Dia], two classes of magnetic rotating solutions in four [\cite=Deh4] and higher dimensional dilaton gravity in the presence of one Liouville-type potential have been constructed [\cite=SDR]. Unfortunately, these solutions [\cite=Deh4] [\cite=SDR] are neither asymptotically flat nor (A)dS. The purpose of the present Letter is to construct a new class of static and spinning magnetic dilaton string solutions which produces a longitudinal magnetic field in the background of anti-de Sitter spacetime. We will also present the suitable counterterm which removes the divergences of the action, and calculate the conserved quantities by using the counterterm method.

Basic Equations

Our starting point is the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton action

[formula]

where R is the scalar curvature, Φ is the dilaton field, Fμν  =  ∂μAν  -  ∂νAμ is the electromagnetic field tensor, and Aμ is the electromagnetic potential. α is an arbitrary constant governing the strength of the coupling between the dilaton and the Maxwell field. The last term in Eq. ([\ref=Act]) is the Gibbons-Hawking surface term. It is required for the variational principle to be well-defined. The factor Θ represents the trace of the extrinsic curvature for the boundary ∂M and γ is the induced metric on the boundary. While α = 0 corresponds to the usual Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory, α = 1 indicates the dilaton-electromagnetic coupling that appears in the low energy string action in Einstein's frame. For arbitrary value of α in AdS space the form of the dilaton potential V(Φ) is chosen as [\cite=Gao1]

[formula]

Here Λ is the cosmological constant. It is clear that the cosmological constant is coupled to the dilaton field in a very nontrivial way. This type of the dilaton potential was introduced for the first time by Gao and Zhang [\cite=Gao1]. They derived, by applying a coordinates transformation which recast the solution in the Schwarzchild coordinates system, the static dilaton black hole solutions in the background of (A)dS universe. For this purpose, they required the existence of the (A)dS dilaton black hole solutions and extracted successfully the form of the dilaton potential leading to (A)dS-like solutions. They also argued that this type of derived potential can be obtained when a higher dimensional theory is compactified to four dimensions, including various supergravity models [\cite=Gid]. In the absence of the dilaton field the action ([\ref=Act]) reduces to the action of Einstein-Maxwell gravity with cosmological constant. Varying the action ([\ref=Act]) with respect to the gravitational field gμν, the dilaton field Φ and the gauge field Aμ, yields

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The conserved mass and angular momentum of the solutions of the above field equations can be calculated through the use of the substraction method of Brown and York [\cite=BY]. Such a procedure causes the resulting physical quantities to depend on the choice of reference background. A well-known method of dealing with this divergence for asymptotically AdS solutions of Einstein gravity is through the use of counterterm method inspired by AdS/CFT correspondence [\cite=Mal]. In this Letter, we deal with the spacetimes with zero curvature boundary, Rabcd(γ) = 0, and therefore the counterterm for the stress energy tensor should be proportional to γab. We find the suitable counterterm which removes the divergences of the action in the form (see also [\cite=otha])

[formula]

One may note that in the absence of a dilaton field where we have V(Φ) = 2Λ =  - 6 / l2, the above counterterm has the same form as in the case of asymptotically AdS solutions with zero-curvature boundary. Having the total finite action [formula] at hand, one can use the quasilocal definition to construct a divergence free stress-energy tensor [\cite=BY]. Thus the finite stress-energy tensor in four-dimensional Einstein-dilaton gravity with three Liouville-type dilaton potentials ([\ref=v1]) can be written as

[formula]

The first two terms in Eq. ([\ref=Stres]) are the variation of the action ([\ref=Act]) with respect to γab, and the last two terms are the variation of the boundary counterterm ([\ref=cont]) with respect to γab. To compute the conserved charges of the spacetime, one should choose a spacelike surface B in ∂M with metric σij, and write the boundary metric in ADM (Arnowitt-Deser-Misner) form:

[formula]

where the coordinates φi are the angular variables parameterizing the hypersurface of constant r around the origin, and N and Vi are the lapse and shift functions, respectively. When there is a Killing vector field [formula] on the boundary, then the quasilocal conserved quantities associated with the stress tensors of Eq. ([\ref=Stres]) can be written as

[formula]

where σ is the determinant of the metric σij, [formula] and na are, respectively, the Killing vector field and the unit normal vector on the boundary B. For boundaries with timelike (ξ  =  ∂  /  ∂t) and rotational (ς  =  ∂  /  ∂φ) Killing vector fields, one obtains the quasilocal mass and angular momentum

[formula]

These quantities are, respectively, the conserved mass and angular momenta of the system enclosed by the boundary B. Note that they will both depend on the location of the boundary B in the spacetime, although each is independent of the particular choice of foliation B within the surface ∂M.

Static magnetic dilaton string

Here we want to obtain the four-dimensional solution of Eqs. ([\ref=FE1])-([\ref=FE3]) which produces a longitudinal magnetic fields along the z direction. We assume the following form for the metric [\cite=Lem1]

[formula]

The functions f(ρ) and R(ρ) should be determined and l has the dimension of length which is related to the cosmological constant Λ by the relation l2 =  - 3 / Λ. The coordinate z has the dimension of length and ranges -    ∞   < z <   ∞  , while the angular coordinate φ is dimensionless as usual and ranges 0  ≤  φ < 2π. The motivation for this curious choice of the metric gauge

[formula]

Spinning magnetic dilaton string

Now, we would like to endow the spacetime solution ([\ref=Met1]) with a rotation. In order to add an angular momentum to the spacetime, we perform the following rotation boost in the t - φ plane

[formula]

where a is a rotation parameter and [formula]. Substituting Eq. ([\ref=Tr]) into Eq. ([\ref=Met2]) we obtain

[formula]

where f(r) and R(r) are given in Eqs. ([\ref=f2]) and ([\ref=R2]). The non-vanishing electromagnetic field components become

[formula]

The transformation ([\ref=Tr]) generates a new metric, because it is not a permitted global coordinate transformation. This transformation can be done locally but not globally. Therefore, the metrics ([\ref=Met2]) and ([\ref=Met3]) can be locally mapped into each other but not globally, and so they are distinct. Note that this spacetime has no horizon and curvature singularity. However, it has a conical singularity at r = 0. It is notable to mention that for α = 0, this solution reduces to the asymtotically AdS magnetic rotating string solution presented in [\cite=Lem2].

The mass and angular momentum per unit length of the string when the boundary B goes to infinity can be calculated through the use of Eqs. ([\ref=Mastot]) and ([\ref=Angtot]). We obtain

[formula]

[formula]

For a = 0 (Ξ = 1), the angular momentum per unit length vanishes, and therefore a is the rotational parameter of the spacetime.

Finally, we compute the electric charge of the solutions. To determine the electric field one should consider the projections of the electromagnetic field tensor on special hypersurface. The normal vectors to such hypersurface for the spacetime with a longitudinal magnetic field are

[formula]

and the electric field is Eμ = gμρe- 2αΦFρνuν. Then the electric charge per unit length Q can be found by calculating the flux of the electric field at infinity, yielding

[formula]

It is worth noting that the electric charge is proportional to the rotation parameter, and is zero for the case of static solution. This result is expected since now, besides the magnetic field along the φ coordinate, there is also a radial electric field (Ftr  ≠  0). To give a physical interpretation for the appearance of the net electric charge, we first consider the static spacetime. The magnetic field source can be interpreted as composed of equal positive and negative charge densities, where one of the charge density is at rest and the other one is spinning. Clearly, this system produce no electric field since the net electric charge density is zero, and the magnetic field is produced by the rotating electric charge density. Now, we consider the rotating solution. From the point of view of an observer at rest relative to the source (S), the two charge densities are equal, while from the point of view of an observe [formula] that follows the intrinsic rotation of the spacetime, the positive and negative charge densities are not equal, and therefore the net electric charge of the spacetime is not zero.

Conclusion and discussion

In conclusion, with an appropriate combination of three Liouville-type dilaton potentials, we constructed a class of four-dimensionl magnetic dilaton string solutions which produces a longitudinal magnetic field in the background of anti-de Sitter universe. These solutions have no curvature singularity and no horizon, but have conic singularity at r = 0. In fact, we showed that near the origin r = 0, the metric ([\ref=Met2]) describes a spacetime which is locally flat but has a conical singularity at r = 0 with a deficit angle δφ = 8πμ, where μ can be interpreted as the mass per unit length of the string. In these static spacetimes, the electric field vanishes and therefore the string has no net electric charge. Then we added an angular momentum to the spacetime by performing a rotation boost in the t - φ plane. For the spinning string, when the rotation parameter is nonzero, the string has a net electric charge which is proportional to the magnitude of the rotation parameter. We found the suitable counterterm which removes the divergences of the action in the presence of three Liouville-type dilaton potentials. We also computed the conserved quantities of the solutions through the use of the conterterm method inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence.

It is worth comparing the solutions obtained here to the electrically charged rotating dilaton black string solutions presented in [\cite=shey1]. In the present work I have studied the magnetic spinning dilaton string which produces a longitudinal magnetic field in AdS spaces which is the correct one generalizing of the magnetic string solution of Dias and Lemos in dilaton theory [\cite=Lem2], while in [\cite=shey1] I constructed charged rotating dilaton black string in AdS spaces which is the generalization of the charged rotating string solutions of [\cite=Lem3] in dilaton gravity. Although solution ([\ref=f(r)]) of the present paper is similar to Eq. (16) of Ref. [\cite=shey1] (except the sign of c) and both solutions represent dilaton string, however, there are some different between the magnetic string and the electrically charged dilaton black string solutions. First, the choice of the metric gauge
