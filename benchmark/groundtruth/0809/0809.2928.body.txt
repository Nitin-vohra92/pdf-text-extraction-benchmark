Polarimetry with a soft x-ray spectrometer

INTRODUCTION

Although polarization is a fundamental property of electromagnetic radiation, there have been no astronomical measurements of polarization in the X-ray band in over 30 yr. There has been no lack of workable concepts, including simple designs such as the Polarimeter for Low Energy X-ray Astrophysical Sources (PLEXAS) that was proposed by Marshall et al. (2003) to use multilayer-coated mirrors tuned to 0.25 keV as Bragg reflectors.[\cite=plexas] An excellent review of the history and prospects for astronomical polarimetry in the 0.1-10 keV band is presented by Weisskopf et al. (2006)[\cite=weisskopf06]. Weisskopf et al. rightly argue that the PLEXAS design had a narrow bandpass, reducing its attractiveness for astrophysical observations because one expects polarization to be energy dependent, so a wide bandpass is desired.

Marshall (2007[\cite=2007SPIE.6688E..31M]; hereafter, Paper I) described a method to overcome this limitation by using transmission gratings to disperse in the incoming X-rays. Then, a multilayer-coated reflector would be used to modulate the signal in a way depending on the polarization. Two approaches were suggested. The first was a simple modification of a dispersive spectrometer, such as a grating spectrometer proposed for Constellation-X (Con-X). The second approach was intended to provide a means for obtaining polarimetric data by inserting optics forward of the focal plane of a long focal length telescope such as XEUS.

Similar to one of the approaches suggested in Paper I, this paper is limited to the case where the polarization is determined by measuring spectral intensity along different dispersed spectra. In this case, we consider a configuration that would be appropriate for a small orbiting observatory.

A Soft X-ray Polarizing Spectrometer

The Spectrometer

As in Paper I, the approach to this polarimeter design was inspired by a new blazed transmission grating design, called the Critical Angle Transmission (CAT) grating [\cite=Heilmann:08], and the corresponding application to the Con-X mission in the design of a transmission grating spectrometer[\cite=flanagan07]. For details of the Con-X mission, see the Con-X web site at http://constellation.gsfc.nasa.gov/. This type of grating can provide very high efficiency in first order in the soft X-ray band. For a spectrometer, one places detectors on the Rowland torus, which is slightly ahead of the telescope's imaging surface.

As in the design for Con-X, using a sector of the primary allows one to take advantage of the asymmetric scattering profile of the mirror surfaces. As noted by Cash (1987, and references therein)[\cite=], the scattering profile is much broader in the plane that contains the optical axis (radially away from the mirror surface) than in the azimuthal direction. Thus, the images produced using a small sector of the mirror will be narrow in one dimension and broad in the other. By arranging the gratings so that the dispersion direction is along the direction of tight imaging, one obtains better spectral resolution than if the entire aperture was used. We exploit this feature to provide modest spectral resolution in each of many sectors, even with mirrors with 0.5-1.5 half-power diameter imaging.

There are several factors involved in setting the telescope focal length: the grating period, P; the mirror imaging size (in one dimension), δθ; and the shortest wavelength of interest, λmin. For a given focal length, F, and placing the gratings at, say, 0.9F from the polarizer, we find that the spectral resolution is given by [formula]. For this study, we target a spectral resolution of ~   200 at the shortest wavelengths of interest, near 1.5 nm (0.8 keV), so that we may obtain a spectral resolution that is >    ×  2 better than that provided by the multilayer coatings. This criterion gives δθ  =  14 in one dimension. The mirror half-power diameter can be 4-10×   larger than this value, due to the larger in-plane mirror scattering. Thus, mirrors with average imaging of order 1-2 would be acceptable for this project.

The system focal length is set only by the requirement that the detector pixels are at least ×  4 smaller than the spectral resolution element, Fδθ. For 25μ pixel sizes, then F  >  1.5 m, so the telescope can be very short. Effective area is a premium in polarimetry, due to the expected low polarization signals. For a graze angle of 1, needed to reflect 0.8 keV X-rays off Al mirrors at >  90% efficiency, the mirror diameter could be 28 cm for F  =  2 m. Assuming an inner diameter of 10 cm and an average reflectivity to two reflections of about 70%, the effective area of the mirror would be about 200 cm2.

The Polarizer

A CAT-based spectrometer becomes a polarimeter by placing multilayer-coated flats on the Rowland circle instead redirecting and polarizing the spectra. The flats are tilted about the spectral dispersion axis by an angle θ. For this study, the graze angle, θ is 40. The detectors are then oriented toward the mirrors at an angle 90 - 2 * θ  =  10 to the plane perpendicular to the optical axis of the telescope. Fig. [\ref=fig:layout08] shows how the optics might look. In this case, the entrance aperture is divided into seven sectors, with gratings aligned to each other in each sector and along the average radial direction to the optical axis. This approach generates seven spectra that are reflected by seven polarizing flats to seven detectors.

The multilayer spacing, d, on the polarizing flats would vary laterally (along the dispersion) in order to provide optimal reflection at graze angle θ. Such optimization is obtained by equating the wavelength from the linearized grating equation, mλ  =  Px / DR, to that of a multilayer, λ  =  2d sin θ, giving

[formula]

where x is the distance along the dispersion from 0th order, DR is the Rowland diameter (the distance between the gratings and the usual detector plane), and m is the grating order. Thus, the multilayer period varies linearly with x, providing high reflectivity in a narrow bandpass at large graze angles. For a given order, the spectrometer's gratings direct a narrow bandpass to any given position on the flat, so the bandpass of the multilayer can be similarly narrow. The bandpass of the multilayer decreases approximately as 1 / N for a large number of layers, N, so if the spectrometer has a resolution better than 200, say, then [formula]. Large N also improves the multilayer reflectivity.

At Brewster's angle, θ  =  45, reflectivity is minimized when the E-vector is in the plane containing the incident ray and the surface normal (p-polarized) and maximized when the E-vector is in the surface plane (s-polarized). The polarization position angle (PA) is the average orientation in sky coordinates of the E-vector for the incoming X-rays. Sampling at least 3 PAs is required in order to measure three Stokes parameters (I, Q, U) uniquely, so one would require at least three separate detector systems with accompanying multilayer-coated flats. For this study and for the sake of redundancy, seven detector-flat combinations are assumed.

Following Marshall et al.[\cite=pkspolar] and Paper I, the intensity Iλ at wavelength λ varies with azimuthal angle φ as

[formula]

where I0λ is directly related to the I Stokes parameter of the source as a function of wavelength λ, P0λ is the polarization fraction at this wavelength, φλ is the phase determined by the orientation of average polarization E-vector on the sky (i.e., the polarization PA), and Mλ is the average system modulation factor. The modulation factor is a function of wavelength, given by [formula], where Rs and Rp are the reflectivities for the s and p polarizations, respectively. The Stokes Q and U parameters can be derived from P0 and φ as a function of wavelength as long as there are three or more position angles that do not differ from each other by 180.

System Throughput and Sensitivity

Using the Center for X-ray Optics web page ( http://henke.lbl.gov/optical_constants/multi2.html), multilayer efficiencies were computed for a small range of materials for many of the relevant graze angles and corresponding d values. For this work, N was set to 200 and the interdiffusion thickness was set to 0.3 nm, as has been achieved by several groups[\cite=windt04] [\cite=1998ApOpt..37.1873M] [\cite=1996ApOpt..35.5134M]. Table [\ref=tab:mlspecs] gives a sampling of the results, where r is the peak reflectivity to unpolarized X-rays. The thickness of the first material is 0.4d, while that of the second material is 0.6d for each calculation. All modulation factors are larger than 85%.

For the purposes of this analysis, a CCD detector is assumed to have a thin Al overlayer to act as an optical blocking filter. The resulting effective area is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:effarea], along with the modulation factor, M.

The effective area estimate can be used to predict the minimum detectable polarization[\cite=weisskopf06] (MDP) for potential targets. As described by Marshall et al[\cite=plexas], extragalactic sources such as the BL Lac object PKS 2155-  304 are expected to be highly polarized in the X-ray band. In a 100,000 s observation of PKS 2155-  304, this instrument could detect polarizations of 3-7% in each of four bandpasses 1 nm wide from 2 to 6 nm (0.21 to 0.62 keV). Fig. [\ref=fig:mdp] shows the results graphically. In addition, isolated neutron stars such as RX J0720.4-  3125 are expected to polarized due to effects of photon propagation in strong magnetic fields[\cite=weisskopf06]. In this case, it is worthwhile to obtain phase-resolved polarization data. In a 200,000 s observation with this instrument, one could reach MDPs of 5-8% over the 2-5 nm band (in 1 nm wide bands) for each of 10 phase bins.

There are many combinations of elements and multilayer coating parameters that were not investigated for this preliminary study, so one might expect to improve upon the mulilayer-coating reflectivities. It may be possible to superpolish the substrates to obtain 0.1 nm roughness[\cite=2001SPIE.4506..113K], which would increase reflectivities significantly.

A Test and Calibration Facility

Drs. R. Heilmann and N. Schulz are currently working to fully recommission the X-ray grating evaluation facility (X-GEF), a 17 m beamline that was developed for testing transmission gratings fabricated at MIT for the Chandra project[\cite=1994SPIE.2280..257D]. In addition to plans to test CAT and other types of gratings, we have proposed to add equipment to the facility so that it may be used for testing and calibrating components that could be used in a soft X-ray polarimeter. Fig. [\ref=fig:polnlab] shows how it might appear when operational.

Equipment to be added to X-GEF would include a new X-ray source with multilayer coated optics to produce highly polarized X-rays at each of five X-ray emission lines (see Table [\ref=tab-lines]), a grating rotation stage to simulate telescope rotation, and a multilayer mirror and CCD combination acting as the polarimeter. The detector and its associated mirror would be mounted on a rotation stage to match the rotation of the grating so that the polarization modulation factor can be measured. The detector's multilayer-coated mirror is challenging to fabricate but two vendors have provided quotes.
