Sudden extinction of a critical branching process in random environment

Introduction and mains results

We consider a branching process in a random environment specified by a sequence of independent identically distributed random offspring generating functions

[formula]

Denoting by Zn the number of particles in the process at time n we define it's evolution by the relations

[formula]

Put [formula], k  ≥  1, and denote S0: = 0, [formula]. Following [\cite=AGKV05] we call the process [formula] critical if and only if the random walk [formula] is oscillating, that is, with probability 1. This means that the stopping time is finite with probability 1 and, as a result (see [\cite=AGKV05]), the extinction moment of the process Z is finite with probability 1. For this reason it is natural to study the asymptotic behavior of the survival probability [formula] as n  →    ∞  . This has been done in [\cite=AGKV05]: If

[formula]

then (under some mild additional assumptions)

[formula]

where l(n) is a slowly varying function and θ is a known positive constant whose explicit expression is given by formula (4.10) in [\cite=AGKV05].

A local version of ([\ref=tails]) was obtained in [\cite=VD97], where it was established that if the offspring generating functions fn(s),n = 0,1,..., are fractional-linear with probability 1 and (along with some other conditions) [formula] and VarXn∈(0,  ∞  ) then

[formula]

The aim of the present paper is to refine equivalence ([\ref=tails]) and to complement ([\ref=vdd]) by investigating the asymptotic behavior of the probability [formula] as n  →    ∞   in the case VarXn  =    ∞  . In addition, we consider the asymptotic behavior of the joint distribution of the random variables T and ZT - 1.

Let be a subset in [formula] For (α,β)∈A and a random variable X we write [formula] if the distribution of X belongs to the domain of attraction of a stable law with characteristic function

[formula]

and, in addition, [formula] if this moment exists. Hence, there exists a sequence [formula] such that c- 1nSn converges in distribution to the stable law whose with characteristic function is specified by ([\ref=std]). Observe that if [formula] then (see, for instance, [\cite=Zol57]) the quantity ρ in ([\ref=Spit]) is calculated by the formula

[formula]

Introduce the following basic assumption:

Condition A: random variables [formula] are independent copies of [formula] with α < 2 and [formula].

Now we formulate our first result.

Assume that the offspring generating functions are geometric, i.e.,

[formula]

with {Xn,n  ≥  1} satisfying Condition A. Then

[formula]

In the case of geometric offspring distributions one has an explicit formula for the conditional probability of the event {T = n} given the environment [formula] in terms of an exponential functional of the associated random walk {Sk,k  ≥  0}, see ([\ref=condPr]) below. Thus, the analysis of the extinction probability [formula] in this case is reduced to the study of the expectation of a certain functional of the associated random walk.

We now turn to the joint distribution of T and the size ZT - 1. Here we don't restrict ourselves to the case of geometric reproduction laws. To formulate our result we set and let [formula] denote the meander of a strictly stable process with parameters α,β, i.e., a strictly stable Levy process conditioned to stay positive on the time interval (0,1] (see [\cite=Don85] and [\cite=Dur78] for details). Along with the meander Λ consider a stochastic process [formula] defined by where [formula] denotes the space of càdlàg functions on the unit interval.

Assume that Condition A is valid and there exists δ > 0 such thatfor some b  ≥  0. Then, for every x > 0,

[formula]

It is easy to see that ζ(2)  ≤  4 for the geometric offspring distributions. Therefore, the statement of Theorem [\ref=T3] holds in this case. Moreover, in view of ([\ref=T1.1]),

[formula]

provided that the conditions of Theorem [\ref=T1] hold.

We now complement Theorem [\ref=T3] by the following statement being valid for the geometric offspring distributions.

Under the conditions of Theorem [\ref=T1], as n  →    ∞  ,

Here [formula] denotes the weak convergence with respect to the Skorokhod topology in the space [formula]

Combining Theorems [\ref=T1], [\ref=T3], and [\ref=T5] shows, in particular, that

[formula]

in the case when the offspring distributions are geometric. The last equality, along with Theorem [\ref=T5], allows us to make the following nonrigorous description of the evolution of a critical branching process Z, being subject to the conditions of Theorem [\ref=T1]. If the process survives for a long time (T = n  →    ∞  ) then [formula] grows, roughly speaking, as cnΛ̃t up to moment n - 1 and then the process instantly extinct. In particular, log  Zn - 1 is of order cn (compare with Corollary 1.6 in [\cite=AGKV05]). This may be interpreted as the development of the process in a favorable environment up to the moment n - 1 and the sudden extinction of the population at moment T = n  →    ∞   because of a very unfavorable, even "catastrophic" environment at moment n - 1. At the end of the paper we show that this phenomenon is in a sharp contrast with the case [formula], σ2: = VarXn∈(0,  ∞  ). Namely, if, additionally,

[formula]

then

[formula]

while (see Corollary 1.6 in [\cite=AGKV05]) where [formula] is the Brownian meander.

These facts demonstrate that the phenomenon of "sudden extinction" in a favorable environment is absent for the case σ2  <    ∞  . Moreover, one can say that in this case we observe a "natural" extinction of the population. Indeed, the extinction occurs at moment T = n because of the small size of the population in the previous generation rather than under the pressure of the environment.

In the present paper we deal with the annealed approach. As shown in [\cite=VK08], one can not see the phenomenon of "sudden extinction" under the quenched approach even if the conditions of Theorem [\ref=T1] are valid. A "typical" trajectory of a critical branching process in random environment under the quenched approach oscillates before the extinction. The process passes through a number of bottlenecks corresponding to the strictly descending moments of the associated random walk and dies in a "natural" way because of the small number of individuals in generation T - 1. Just as under the annealed approach for the case σ2  <    ∞   (see [\cite=VK08] for a more detailed discussion).

Another consequence of Theorem [\ref=T3] is the following lower bound for [formula].

Under the conditions of Theorem [\ref=T3],

[formula]

We conjecture that the relation [formula] is valid for any critical branching processes in random environment meeting the conditions of Theorem [\ref=T3], i.e., without the assumption that the offspring distributions are geometric. With Theorem [\ref=T3] in hands, one can easily infer that our conjecture is equivalent to the equality But this is exactly the phenomenon of "sudden extinction" described above.

It is known that there is a natural correspondence between the critical (subcritical) branching processes in a random environment and the simple random walks in a random environment with zero (negative) drift. In particular, ([\ref=T1.1]) admits an interpretation in terms of the following simple random walk [formula] in random environment. The walk starts at point R0: = 0 and has transition probabilities

[formula]

[formula], where [formula] are i.i.d. random variables. Let and letbe the local time of the random walk in random environment calculated for the first nonnegative excursion. Clearly, if thenOne can show that [formula] is a branching process in random environment specified by the offspring generating functions (see, [\cite=VD06] for more detail). In particular, [formula] is the extinction moment of the branching process. Clearly, if : =  max 0  ≤  k < χRk then In these terms Theorem [\ref=T1] and relation ([\ref=T4]) are equivalent to the following statement.

If qn and pn,specified by ([\ref=DeQ]) and ([\ref=DeP]) are such that satisfy Condition A, then, as n  →    ∞  , In addition, and, moreover,

Hence, the random walk in random environment visits the maximal possible level for the first excursion many times provided the length χ of the excursion is big. This is essentially different from the case [formula] where (compare with ([\ref=eee]))

Some auxiliary results for random walks

To this aim let us agree to denote by C,C1,C2,..., some constants which may be different from formula to formula.

It is known (see, for instance, [\cite=FE]) that if X∈D(α,β) then the scaling sequence

[formula]

for Sn is regularly varying with index α- 1, i.e., there exists a function l1(n), slowly varying at infinity, such that

[formula]

Moreover, if [formula] with α∈(0,2), then

[formula]

where l0(x) is a function slowly varying at infinity and

[formula]

with p + q = 1 and β = p - q in ([\ref=std]). Besides,

[formula]

by ([\ref=Defc]) and ([\ref=asyma]).

Asymptotic behavior of overshoots and undershoots

In this subsection we prove some results concerning the asymptotic behavior of the distributions of overshoots and undershoots. We believe that these results are of independent interest.

Let

Durrett [\cite=Dur78] has shown that if X∈D(α,β) then

[formula]

By minor changes of the proof of ([\ref=meander]) given by Durrett in [\cite=Dur78], one can demonstrate that

[formula]

We now establish analogs of ([\ref=meander]) and ([\ref=meander1]) under the conditions [formula] and [formula].

If Condition A is valid, then, for any u > 0,

For a fixed u > 0 we have

[formula]

Since, under the conditions of our lemma,

[formula]

uniformly in x∈[0,  ∞  ), we may approximate for large n the right-hand side of ([\ref=3sum]) by the quantity Using ([\ref=Asx]) and ([\ref=meander]), we obtain

[formula]

Recall that, by Theorem 7 in [\cite=VW07],

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

This finishes the proof of the first part of the lemma since

[formula]

according to formula (109) in [\cite=VW07].

To demonstrate the second part it is sufficient to replace τ- by T- everywhere in the arguments above.

If Condition A is valid, then, for any v > 0,

[formula]

To establish the desired statement one should use the equality

[formula]

and a similar representation with τ- replaced by T-, the asymptotic equality ([\ref=Asnu]) with u = 0 and x  ≥  vcn, and the arguments similar to those applied to demonstrate Lemma [\ref=LdderHeight].

It follows from Lemmas [\ref=LdderHeight] and [\ref=LdderJump] that the passage from positive to negative (nonnegative) values just at moment n is possible only owing to a big negative jump of order cn at this moment. More precisely, in this case both Sn - 1 and - Sn are of order cn.

Expectations on the event {T- = n}

Let  be strictly descending ladder epochs of the random walk S. Clearly, T- = T1. Put Ln: =  min 0  ≤  k  ≤  nSk and introduce the function The fundamental property of the function V(x) is the identity

[formula]

Denote by F the filtration consisting of the σ  -  fields Fn generated by the random variables S0,...,Sn. By means of V(x) we may specify a probability measure [formula] as followswhere ψ is an arbitrary measurable function on the respective space of arguments. One can check that, in view of ([\ref=DefV]), this measure is well defined (see [\cite=AGKV05] for more details).

We now formulate a statement related to the measure [formula] which is a particular case of Lemma 2.5 in [\cite=AGKV05].

[\cite=AGKV05] Let condition ([\ref=Spit]) hold and let ξk be a bounded Fk-measurable random variable. Then More general, let [formula] be a sequence of uniformly bounded random variables adopted to the filtration F such that

[formula]

exists [formula] - a.s. Then

We prove a "local" version of this lemma under the additional assumption X∈D(α,β). To this aim let S̃: = {S̃n,n  ≥  0} be a probabilistic copy of {Sn, ~ n  ≥   ~ 0}. Later on all variables and expectations related with S̃  are supplied with the symbol ~  . For instance, we set n: =  min 0  ≤  k  ≤  nS̃k.

Let X∈D(α,β) with α < 2 and β < 1, and let ξk be a bounded Fk-measurable random variable. Then More general, let [formula] be a sequence of uniformly bounded random variables adopted to the filtration F such that the limit

[formula]

exists [formula] - a.s. Then

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

According to Lemma [\ref=LdderJump], for any fixed ε∈(0,1),

[formula]

and this, by Remark [\ref=Rem1], tends to zero as [formula]. Further,

[formula]

Set [formula]. Since uniformly in u∈[ε,ε- 1], we have

[formula]

Conditioning on [formula] gives

[formula]

Using Lemmas 2.1 and 2.3 from [\cite=AGKV05], one can easily verify that

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

Clearly, [formula] as ε  →  0. Combining these estimates with ([\ref=AsE]), ([\ref=tails]) and the asymptotic relation

[formula]

established in Theorem 8 of [\cite=VW07], and recalling ([\ref=Est10]), we complete the proof of the first part of the lemma.

To show the second part we fix an ε∈(0,1) and write

[formula]

Similarly to ([\ref=Est10]),

[formula]

while, by analogy with ([\ref=Est11]) and ([\ref=Est133]),

[formula]

We know by Lemma [\ref=Lappbasic3] that, given ([\ref=AS]),

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=time1])-([\ref=time3]) completes the proof of the second part of the lemma.

To prove ([\ref=FFin]) it is sufficient to observe that, by ([\ref=ASSS]) and the dominated convergence theorem,

Set μn: =  min {k  ≥  0:Sk = Ln}.

If X∈D(α,β) thenand

[formula]

By the factorization identity (see, for instance, Theorem 8.9.3 in [\cite=BGT]) applied with λ =  - 1 and μ = 1 to Ln instead of Mn: =  max 0  ≤  k  ≤  nSk, we haveSince X∈D(α,β), the local limit theorem for asymptotically stable random walks implies

[formula]

Combining this with Theorem 6 in [\cite=Rog76] givesproving the first statement of the lemma.

To prove the second it is sufficient to note (see, for instance, Theorem 8.9.1 in [\cite=BGT]) that and to use estimate ([\ref=UU]) once again.

The previous lemma allows us to prove the following statement.

If X∈D(α,β) with α < 2 and β < 1, then for every ε > 0 there exists a positive integer l such that for all n  ≥  l.

By Lemma [\ref=LMinMax] and ([\ref=**]) we have, for any δ∈(0,1),

[formula]

On account of ([\ref=**]),

[formula]

Using ([\ref=ro]) it is not difficult to check that 1 - ρ  <  α- 1 if Condition A holds. With this in view we have, by ([\ref=asyma]) and ([\ref=**]),

[formula]

Substituting ([\ref=H1]) and ([\ref=H2]) in ([\ref=H0]) gives

[formula]

for sufficiently large C3. Recalling now ([\ref=TT]), we complete the proof of the lemma by an appropriate choice of δ and l.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=T1]

SetRewriting ([\ref=geom]) as one can easily get the representation

[formula]

for all n  ≥  1. From this equality, setting we get and

[formula]

We split the expectation [formula] into two parts:

[formula]

One can easily verify that Hn - 1Hne- Sn  ≤  e2Ln - Sn on the event {μn < n}. From this bound and Lemma [\ref=LMinMax] we infer

[formula]

Using estimate ([\ref=H2]) with δ = 0, we conclude

[formula]

Consider now the expectation [formula]. Applying Lemma [\ref=LMinMax] once again, we see that

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

Since [formula] we have by Lemma [\ref=LtailSer] that for any ε > 0 there exists l such that for all n > l

[formula]

for all n  ≥  l. Denoting by [formula] a probabilistic and independent copy of [formula] we have, for any fixed k < l,

[formula]

By monotonicity of the extinction probability and Lemma 2.7 in [\cite=AGKV05],Hence, in view of ([\ref=FFin]) we get for any fixed k < l:

[formula]

Using this relation, ([\ref=**]) and ([\ref=RRR]) it is not difficult to show that

[formula]

where

[formula]

It follows from ([\ref=1]), ([\ref=SSS]), ([\ref=9]) and ([\ref=SSemi]) thatIt is easy to check that the expression for θ given by ([\ref=NUU]) is in complete agreement with formula (4.10) in [\cite=AGKV05]. This finishes the proof of Theorem [\ref=T1].

Proofs for the general case

Proof of Theorem [\ref=T3]. First we obtain lower and upper bounds for the probability [formula]. It is easy to see that (recall ([\ref=DefF])) Therefore, for any fixed [formula],

[formula]

To get an upper estimate we use the inequality [formula] being valid for any nonnegative random variables with [formula] to conclude that Observing thatwe getThis implies

[formula]

In view of the hypothesis [formula] and the Markov inequality we have

[formula]

Since the probability [formula] is regularly varying with index -  α, estimates ([\ref=Llow])- ([\ref=Upper3]) imply

[formula]

Letting ε  →  0 givesTherefore,

[formula]

Since uniformly in y∈[x,  ∞  ), we have

[formula]

By Corollary 1.6 in [\cite=AGKV05],This and the dominated convergence theorem yield

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=New0])-([\ref=New2]) and taking into account ([\ref=Asx]) and ([\ref=AsE]), we obtain

[formula]

To complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=T3] it remains to note that in view of ([\ref=tails]) and ([\ref=**]).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=T5]. Let φ be an arbitrary bounded continuous function from [formula] and let As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=T3], for any x > 0,

[formula]

where in the last step we have used Corollary 1.6 in [\cite=AGKV05].

On the other hand, according to ([\ref=ttt]),

[formula]

as [formula]. Combining ([\ref=Func]) and ([\ref=fff]), we getcompleting the proof of Theorem [\ref=T5].

Proof of Corollary [\ref=Col1]. Letting x  →  0 in ([\ref=T3.2]), we get

[formula]

Assuming that there exists ε > 0 such that for all n  ≥  N and summing over n from arbitrary n0 > N to ∞  , we deduce for all n0  ≥  N, that contradicts ([\ref=tails]).

Proof of ([\ref=eee]). Representation ([\ref=ddd]) impliesHence, by Lemma [\ref=LMinMax],

[formula]

where in the last step we have used the equality [formula]. Now we see that

[formula]

According to Theorem 1 in [\cite=VD97] the conditions σ2  <    ∞   and ([\ref=add]) yield [formula]. From this estimate, the first condition in ([\ref=add]), and ([\ref=kkk]) we get ([\ref=eee]).
