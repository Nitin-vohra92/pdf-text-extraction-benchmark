On "Regular Landsberg metrics are always Berwald" by Z. I. Szabó

In his paper [\cite=Sz2], Z. I. Szabó claimed (Theorem 3.1) that all sufficiently smooth Landsberg Finsler metrics are Berwald; this claim solves the long-standing "unicorn" problem. Unfortunately, as I explain below, the proof of the statement has a gap.

Following [\cite=Sz2], let us consider a smooth n - dimensional manifold M with a proper Finsler metric [formula]. The second differential of [formula] will be denoted by g = g(x,yx) and should be viewed as a Riemannian metric on the punctured tangent space TxM - {0}.

For a smooth curve c(t) connecting two points a,b∈M, we denote by

[formula]

the Berwald parallel transport along the curve c. Following [\cite=Sz1], Z. I. Szabó considers the following Riemannian metric [formula] on M canonically constructed by F by the formula

[formula]

where ξ,η∈TxM are two arbitrary vectors, and the volume form dμ on TxM is given by [formula].

Z. I. Szabó claims that if the Finsler metric F is Landsberg, the Berwald parallel transport preserves the Riemannian metric [formula]. According to the definitions in Section 2 of [\cite=Sz2], this claim means that for every ξ,η,ν∈TaM

[formula]

This claim is crucial for the proof; the remaining part of the proof is made of relatively simple standard arguments, and is correct. The claim itself is explained very briefly; basically Z. I. Szabó writes that, for Landsberg metrics, the unite ball {yx∈TxM|F(x,yx)  ≤  1}, the volume form dμ, and the metric g(x,yx) are preserved by the parallel transport, and, therefore, the metric [formula] given by [\eqref=1] must be preserved as well.

Indeed, for Landsberg metrics, the unite ball and the volume form dμ are preserved by the parallel transport. Unfortunately, it seems that the metric g is preserved in a slightly different way one needs to prove the claim.

More precisely, plugging [\eqref=1] in [\eqref=2], we obtain

[formula]

As it is explained for example in Section 2 of [\cite=Sz2], for every Finsler metric, the parallel transport preserves the unite ball:

[formula]

The condition that F is Landsberg implies φ*dμ(a,ya)  =  dμ(b,φ(ya)). Thus, Szabó's claim is trivially true if at every ya∈TaM

[formula]

But the condition that the metric is Landsberg means that

[formula]

only, i.e., [\eqref=4] coincides with the definition of the Landsberg metric at the only point ya  =  ν∈TaM.

Since no explanation why [\eqref=3] holds is given in the paper, I tend to suppose that Z. I. Szabó oversaw the difference between the formulas [\eqref=4] and [\eqref=5]; anyway, at the present point, the proof of Theorem 3.1 in [\cite=Sz2] is not complete. Unfortunately, I could not get any explanation from Z. I. Szabó by email.

The unicorn problem remains open until somebody closes the gap, or presents another proof, or proves the existence of a counterexample; at the present point I can do neither of these.
