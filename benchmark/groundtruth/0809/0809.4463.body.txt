Generation and syzygies of the first secant variety

Introduction

This should not be considered a final version. Instead, I wanted to correct an error in version 2 of the posted preprint. I was able to re-establish the degree bounds found there for curves, but I have not yet completed work on the higher-dimensional case.

We work throughout over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Let [formula] be a smooth variety embedded by a line bundle L and let Σi denote the (complete) variety of (i + 1)-secant i-planes. Though secant varieties are a very classical subject, the majority of the work done involves determining the dimensions of secant varieties to well-known varieties. Perhaps the two most well-known results in this direction are the solution by Alexander and Hirschowitz (completed in [\cite=ah]) of the Waring problem for homogeneous polynomials and the classification of the Severi varieties by Zak [\cite=zak].

More recently there has been great interest, e.g. related to algebraic statistics and algebraic complexity, in determining the equations defining secant varieties (e.g. [\cite=ar], [\cite=bcg], [\cite=CGG05a], [\cite=CGG05b], [\cite=CGG07], [\cite=CGG], [\cite=unex], [\cite=cs], [\cite=gss], [\cite=kanev], [\cite=Lan06], [\cite=Lan08], [\cite=LM08], [\cite=LW07], [\cite=LW08], [\cite=sidsul], [\cite=ss]). In this work, we use the detailed geometric information concerning secant varieties developed by Bertram [\cite=bertram], Thaddeus [\cite=thaddeus], and the author [\cite=vermeireflip1] to lay some fundamental groundwork for studying not just the equations defining secant varieties, but the syzygies among those equations as well.

It was conjectured in [\cite=eks] and it was shown in [\cite=ravi] that if C is a smooth curve embedded by a line bundle of degree at least 4g + 2k + 3 then Σk is set theoretically defined by the (k  +  2)  ×  (k  +  2) minors of a matrix of linear forms. It was further shown in [\cite=vermeireflip2] that if [formula] satisfies condition N2 then Σ1(vd(X)) is set theoretically defined by cubics for [formula].

In [\cite=vermeiresecantreg] it was shown that if C is a smooth curve embedded by a line bundle of degree at least 2g + 3 then IΣ1 is 5-regular, and under the same hypothesis it was shown in [\cite=sidver] that Σ1 is arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay. Together with the analogous well-known facts for the curve C itself [\cite=fujita], [\cite=mgreen], [\cite=mumford], this led to the following conjecture, extending that found in [\cite=vermeireflip2]:

[\cite=sidver] Suppose that [formula] is a smooth linearly normal curve of degree d  ≥  2g + 2k + 1 + p, where [formula]. Then

Σk is ACM and IΣk has regularity 2k + 3 unless g = 0, in which case the regularity is k + 2.

[formula]

Σk satisfies Nk + 2,p.

Recall [\cite=EGHP] that a variety [formula] satisfies [formula] if the ideal of Z is generated in degree r and the syzygies among the equations are linear for p - 1 steps. Note that condition Np [\cite=mgreen] implies N2,p.

By the work of Green and Lazarsfeld [\cite=mgreen],[\cite=laz], the conjecture holds for k = 0. Further, by [\cite=fisher] and by [\cite=vBH] it holds for [formula], and by [\cite=sidver] parts (1) and (2) hold for k = 1. In this work, we show that part (3) holds for k = 1 (Theorem [\ref=forcurves]). More generally, we show that for an arbitrary smooth variety, Σ1 satisfies N3,p for all sufficiently positive embeddings (Corollary [\ref=suffpos]), and we give effective results on arbitrary smooth varieties embedded by adjoint linear systems (Corollary [\ref=adjointsec]).

Our approach combines the geometric knowledge of secant varieties mentioned above with the well-known Koszul approach of Green and Lazarsfeld. To fix notation, if L is a vector bundle on a projective variety X, then we let [formula], where [formula] is the natural double cover, and if L is a globally generated line bundle on a projective variety X inducing a morphism [formula], then we have the vector bundle [formula] on X.

Preliminaries

Our starting point is the familiar:

Let [formula] be a smooth variety embedded by a line bundle L. Then Σ1 satisfies [formula] if [formula], 2  ≤  a  ≤  p + 1, b  ≥  2.

Because L also induces an embedding [formula], we abuse notation and denote the associated vector bundle on Σ1 by ML. Letting [formula] and applying [\cite=eisenbud] to OΣ1 gives the exact sequence:

[formula]

The vanishing in the hypothesis implies that [formula] for d  ≥  k + 1, and hence that the first syzygies of OΣ1, which are the generators of the ideal of Σ1, are in degree ≤  k. The rest of the vanishings yield the analogous statements for higher syzygies.

[formula]

The technical portion of the paper is devoted to reinterpreting the vanishings in Proposition [\ref=basic] in terms of vanishings on the Hilbert scheme [formula], and then finally on X itself.

If X is a smooth variety embedded by a 3-very ample line bundle L satisfying N2,2, then Σ satisfies [formula] if

[formula]

is injective for 2  ≤  a  ≤  p + 1, b  ≥  2.

This follows immediately from the start of the 5-term sequence associated to the Leray-Serre spectral sequence:

[formula]

and Proposition [\ref=basic].

To simplify notation, we introduce a technical condition:

For p  ≥  1, we say a line bundle L = OX(1) on [formula] satisfies NΣp if

L is 3-very ample and satisfies N2,p.

[formula] for [formula].

As the vanishing condition in the definition of NΣp is non-trivial to understand, we explore several cases where it is satisfied in the next section.

Condition NΣp

For curves, verification of NΣp is straightforward.

Let [formula] be a smooth curve satisfying Np, [formula], with L = OX(1) non-special. Then L satisfies NΣp.

We need to show [formula] for [formula].

Because X is projectively normal we have [formula] for i > 0, [formula]. Thus [formula]. By [\cite=sidver], we know that [formula].

Now, for [formula], the arguments in [\cite=vermeiresecantreg] and in [\cite=sidver] go through under the stated hypotheses to give [formula] for [formula]. The extra hypothesis used in those papers (namely, that deg (L)  ≥  2g + 3) is needed only to show [formula] for [formula].

Verifying condition NΣp in the general case takes somewhat more work, but the end results are reasonable. We first need a computation which will be used in both Proposition [\ref=vanishonsec] and in Theorem [\ref=forgeneral].

Let X be a smooth variety embedded by a 3-very ample line bundle L satisfying N2,2. Then [formula].

Consider the sequence on [formula]:

[formula]

As [formula], pushing down to [formula] we have ([\cite=sidver])

[formula]

where d*M = OZ( - EΔ).

Thus [formula]. However, we know by [\cite=conrad] that

[formula]

where [formula] [\cite=hart]. Thus we have

[formula]

and so [formula]. Restricting (pulling back) this equality to Z and noting ([\cite=vermeireidealreg]) that [formula], we have [formula].

We now interpret the vanishing condition in the definition of NΣp in terms of X.

Let [formula] be a smooth variety embedded by a 3-very ample line bundle L satisfying N2,2 such that [formula] for [formula], [formula], [formula]. Then [formula] for [formula].

Suppose b = 2r is even. We know by the proof of [\cite=vermeireidealreg] that [formula]; thus

[formula]

Because [formula], we know [formula] for some line bundle M, and hence we know that [formula], but this says that [formula]. From the sequences

[formula]

for k + 1  ≤  r we see that [formula], as the cohomology of the rightmost terms vanishes by hypothesis since [formula].

Now, suppose that b = 2r + 1 is odd. As in the previous paragraph, we have [formula], thus we see that [formula]. It is therefore enough to show that [formula], and then repeating the same argument as above gives [formula].

We have the sequence on Z

[formula]

where [formula] by Lemma [\ref=det]. As in the proof of Lemma [\ref=det], we have [formula], thus

[formula]

Thus it suffices to show [formula]. However, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

and so the cohomology of each vanishes by hypothesis.

Fortunately, the vanishing in Proposition [\ref=vanishonsec] is not too difficult to understand.

Let X be a smooth variety of dimension d, M a very ample line bundle. Choose k so that k  ≥  d + 3 and so that [formula] is big and nef. Letting L = Mk, we have

[formula]

for [formula], [formula], [formula].

Note as above that [formula], where EΔ  →  Δ is the exceptional divisor of the blow-up. Note further that [formula].

Assume first that [formula]. Then

[formula]

but this is KZ + B where

[formula]

Because Mk - KX is ample, [formula] is ample. We are thus left to show that

[formula]

is globally generated. However, as k  ≥  d + 3, we have k(r - 1)  ≥  d - 1 + 2r and so [formula] is globally generated by [\cite=bel]. Thus B is big and nef and so vanishing follows from Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing [\cite=kaw],[\cite=vie].

Now let r = 1. Then

[formula]

but this is KZ + B where

[formula]

As above, B is big and nef.

There are numerous ways to rearrange the terms in Proposition [\ref=uniform] to produce the desired vanishing.

For example, a similar argument shows that if M is very ample, [formula] is big and nef, and B is nef, then letting [formula] gives the vanishing for k  ≥  d + 2 (Cf. [\cite=el]). If, further, B is also big, then letting [formula] gives the vanishing for k  ≥  d + 1.

In Proposition [\ref=uniform], if ω*X is big and nef (e.g. X is Fano) then a slight revision of the argument shows it is enough to take L = Mk for k  ≥  d + 1.

Note that the vanishing condition in Proposition [\ref=vanishonsec] is intimately related to the surjectivity of the higher-order Gauss-Wahl maps as defined in [\cite=wahl].

Main Results

Let [formula] be a smooth variety embedded by a line bundle L satisfying NΣp with Hi(X,Lk) = 0 for [formula]. Then Σ satisfies [formula] if [formula] for 2  ≤  a  ≤  p + 1, [formula].

We use Proposition [\ref=prop:_wts_trans]. From the sequence on [formula]

[formula]

we know

[formula]

The first equality follows as the restriction of [formula] to Z is [formula], the second is standard, and for the third we use the Künneth formula together with the fact that [formula] as X satisfies N2,p.

Thus

[formula]

and so by Proposition [\ref=prop:_wts_trans] it is enough to show that [formula] for 2  ≤  a  ≤  p + 1, [formula].

From the sequence

[formula]

and the fact that [formula], we see that [formula] for [formula].

Let X be a smooth variety embedded by a 3-very ample line bundle L satisfying N2,2 and consider the morphism [formula] induced by the linear system |2H - E|. Then [formula], and hence [formula].

Consider the diagram on [formula]:

The vertical map in the middle is surjective as we have [formula]. Therefore, surjectivity of the lower right horizontal map and commutativity of the diagram show that the righthand vertical map is surjective. Note that [formula] by the projection formula and that the higher direct image sheaves [formula] vanish as [formula] is a [formula]-bundle over [formula] For the higher direct images, we have Riφ*π*L = 0 as the restriction of L to a fiber of φ is O(1) and hence the cohomology along the fibers vanishes. From the rightmost column, we see Riφ*K = 0. From the leftmost column, we have the sequence

[formula]

but as [formula], we have [formula].

Combining Proposition [\ref=prop:_wts_van] with Lemma [\ref=downtohilb] yields:

Let X be a smooth variety embedded by a line bundle L satisfying NΣp with Hi(X,Lk) = 0 for [formula]. Then Σ satisfies [formula] if

[formula]

for 2  ≤  a  ≤  p + 1, [formula].

Curves

We need a technical lemma, completely analogous to [\cite=laz].

Let [formula] be a smooth curve embedded by a non-special line bundle L satisfying N2,2, let [formula] be a general collection of distinct points, and let [formula]. Then there is an exact sequence of vector bundles on X  ×  X

[formula]

Choose a general point x1∈X and consider the following diagram on X  ×  X:

where the center column comes from [\cite=laz]. Following just as in that proof, we obtain

[formula]

from the left column. Note however that d*MEL( - D) is a line bundle, and hence by Lemma [\ref=det] we see [formula].

Let [formula] be a smooth curve embedded by a line bundle L with deg (L)  ≥  2g + p + 3. Then Σ satisfies [formula].

We verify the condition in Corollary [\ref=onhilb]. Pulling the sequence on [formula]

[formula]

back to Z = X  ×  X yields the diagram

As in Lemma [\ref=det], we have [formula] where d*M = O( - Δ), [formula], and [formula]. From the left vertical sequence we have

[formula]

and pushing down to [formula] yields

[formula]

Twisting this sequence by [formula] gives

[formula]

Since [formula], it suffices (as in Proposition [\ref=vanishonsec]) to show that

[formula]

for 2  ≤  a  ≤  p + 1, i = 1,2.

Now, by Lemma [\ref=belikerob] we have exact sequences

[formula]

where [formula].

On the right, we have a direct sum of vector bundles of the form [formula] where F is a line bundle of degree deg (L) - r. Thus H1 and H2 of the right side will vanish when deg (L) - r  ≥  2g + 1.

On the left, we have a direct sum of vector bundles of the form [formula] where F is a line bundle of degree n - 2 - (r - 1) =  deg (L) - g - r - 1. Because [formula] are general, H1 and H2 of the left side will vanish when deg (L) - g - r - 1  ≥  g. Combining these, we see that [formula] for 2  ≤  a  ≤  p + 1, i = 1,2 as long as deg (L)  ≥  2g + p + 3.

Higher Dimensions

Let [formula] be a smooth variety embedded by a line bundle L satisfying NΣp, [formula], with Hi(X,Lk) = 0 for [formula]. If [formula] for 2  ≤  a  ≤  p + 1 and for [formula], then Σ satisfies [formula].

As in Theorem [\ref=forcurves], we have

[formula]

and pushing down to [formula] yields

[formula]

where F2a comes from the standard filtration

[formula]

of [formula] associated to [formula] where

[formula]

Twisting by [formula], we see it is enough to show that

[formula]

for 2  ≤  a  ≤  p + 1, i  ≥  1. However, it is well-known that for L very ample we have [formula].

To verify the new vanishing condition we have:

Let X be a smooth variety of dimension d, M a very ample line bundle. Choose [formula] so that [formula] is big and nef. Letting L = Mk, we have

[formula]

for [formula].

Consider the product of a + 2 factors [formula]. Then (cf. [\cite=inamdar])

[formula]

Arguing as in Proposition [\ref=uniform], we obtain [formula]. However, as we are working in characteristic 0, [formula] is a summand of [formula].

Let X be a smooth variety, M an ample line bundle, and embed X by Mk. Then for all k >  > 0, Σ satisfies N3,p.

Letting L = Mk for k >  > 0, we know [\cite=mgreen],[\cite=inamdar] L satisfies Np. By Proposition [\ref=vanishonsec], L satisfies NΣp. Finally, by Proposition [\ref=verifynew], we have [formula] for 2  ≤  a  ≤  p + 1 and for [formula].

Let [formula] be a smooth projective variety of dimension d, M a very ample line bundle such that [formula] is ample. Embedding X by [formula], [formula], we have Σ satisfies N3,p.

In [\cite=el] it is shown that [formula] satisfies Np + 2. The result now follows as in Remark [\ref=adjoint].

We conjecture what we believe to be the best possible result in general:

Let [formula] be a smooth projective variety with Hi(X,O(k)) = 0 for [formula] satisfying NΣp + d + 1. Then Σ satisfies N3,p.

We can show that under the hypotheses of the Conjecture that Σ satisfies N3 + d,p.
