Birational rigidity of Fano varieties and field extensions

The modern study of the birational properties of Fano varieties started with the works of Iskovskikh; see the surveys [\cite=isk] [\cite=che1] and the many references there. A key concept that emerged in this area is birational rigidity.

Let X be a Fano variety with [formula]-factorial, terminal singularities and Picard number 1. Roughly speaking, X is called birationally rigid if X can not be written in terms of Fano varieties in any other way. The precise definition is the following.

A Mori fiber space is a projective morphism f:X  →  Y such that

X is [formula]-factorial with terminal singularities,

the relative Picard number of X / Y is 1, and

- KX is f-ample.

Let X be a Fano variety with [formula]-factorial, terminal singularities and Picard number 1 defined over a field k. X is called birationally rigid if X is not birational to the total space of any Mori fiber space, save the trivial one [formula].

For our purposes, it is better to separate this condition into 2 parts:

Let X' be a Fano variety with [formula]-factorial, terminal singularities and Picard number 1 over k that is birational to X. Then X' is isomorphic to X.

The only rational map [formula] with rationally connected general fibers is the constant map [formula].

In characteristic 0, [\cite=bchm] implies that a map [formula] as in (5) leads to a Mori fiber space g':X'  →  Y' with X' birational to X but possibly Y' not birational to Y. Thus in characteristic 0 the two versions are equivalent but in positive characteristic this is not known.

The aim of this note is to settle some foundational questions about the behavior of birational rigidity in extensions of algebraically closed fields. In all cases when the birational rigidity of a variety has been proved, the untwisting of birational maps is done by clear geometric constructions that are independent of the algebraically closed field of definition. Our first result shows that, over algebraically closed fields, any untwisting behaves similarly.

Let k be an algebraically closed field and K  ⊃  k an algebraically closed overfield. Let Xk be a Fano variety with Picard number 1 defined over k. Assume that

either [formula] and Xk has [formula]-factorial, terminal singularities

or that Xk is smooth.

Then Xk is birationally rigid iff XK is birationally rigid.

I don't know how [formula]-factoriality behaves in flat families in positive characteristic. This is the main reason why smoothness is assumed. For instance, a cone over an elliptic curve is [formula]-factorial over p, but not [formula]-factorial over any other algebraically closed field. This example has log canonical singularities, but I do not know how to exclude this phenomenon for Fano varieties with terminal singularities. (There is also the slight problem that the definition of terminal may not be clear in positive characteristic.)

There is a very interesting problem related to Theorem [\ref=bir.thm].

Let X be a Fano variety over a field k such that X is birationally rigid over the algebraic closure k̄. Is X birationally rigid over k?

In the terminology of Cheltsov, this asks if the notions of birational rigidity and universal birational rigidity coincide or not.

I think that this is very unlikely but I do not have a counter example. If G denotes the Galois group [formula], then the k-forms of Xk̄ are classified by [formula] and two such forms are birational if they have the same image in [formula]. For an arbitrary variety the map [formula] is not injective. It is quite interesting that for many birationally rigid varieties, the group [formula] is a split extension

[formula]

for a subgroup Γ generated by the "obvious" birational self-maps. For all such examples, [formula] is an injection. See [\cite=mella] [\cite=che2] [\cite=shr] for several relevant examples.

Note also that the question ([\ref=quest]) is not equivalent to the above Galois cohomology problem. Given Xk, in birational geometry we are also interested in birational equivalences Xk  ~  X'k where X'k has Picard number 1 over k but higher Picard number over k̄.

In order to study birational maps of products of Fano varieties, [\cite=che2] introduced a variant of question ([\ref=quest]). (In the terminology of [\cite=che2], one asks for varieties for which [formula] "universally untwists maximal centers.") Our second result characterizes such varieties. For this we need to define the dimension of [formula].

Let X be a projective variety over an algebraically closed field k. A birational map [formula] can be identified with the closure of its graph [formula]. This construction realizes [formula] as an open subscheme of [formula] or of [formula]. Let [formula] denote this injection. In general, [formula] is an at most countable union of finite type subschemes.

We can now define the dimension of [formula] as the supremum of the dimensions of all irreducible subsets of [formula].

This representation, however, is not particularly unique. Let us call a subset [formula] constructible if [formula] is constructible as a subset of [formula] (that is, a finite union of locally closed subvarieties). The notion of a constructible subset is independent of the birational model of X and the constructible structure is compatible with the group multiplication in [formula]. The dimension of a constructible subset is also well defined.

We can also define the dimension of [formula] as the supremum of the dimensions of all constructible subsets of [formula].

Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. Let X be a Fano variety with [formula]-factorial, terminal singularities and Picard number 1 defined over k. The following are equivalent:

X is birationally rigid and [formula].

X is birationally rigid and [formula] for every overfield K  ⊃  k.

XK is birationally rigid and [formula] for every overfield K  ⊃  k.

If k is uncountable, these are further equivalent to

X is birationally rigid and [formula] is countable.

Let k be an algebraically closed field, U a k-variety and XU  →  U a flat family of Fano varieties with terminal singularities. If [formula] then assume in addition that XU  →  U is smooth. Assume that the set

[formula]

is Zariski dense. Then the geometric generic fiber XK of XU  →  U is birationally rigid.

Proof. It is easy to see that the Picard number of XK is also 1. Let πK:X'K  →  SK be a Mori fiber space and [formula] a birational map.

Possibly after replacing U by a generically finite ramified cover, we may assume that the above varieties and maps are defined over U. Thus we have

[formula]

If SU  →  U has positive dimensional fibers, then for almost all u∈R(U), the fiber Xu is birational to a nontrivial Mori fiber space; a contradiction. Thus we may assume that SU = U and the Picard number of X'K is also 1.

Assume for the moment that the Picard number of X'u is also 1 for general u∈R(U). Then [formula] since Xu is birationally rigid.

Let us now consider the scheme [formula] parametrizing isomorphisms between the fibers of XU  →  U and X'U  →  U. Since all isomorphisms preserve the ample anti-canonical class, [formula] is a scheme of finite type over U (cf. [\cite=rc-book]). By assumption [formula] has nonempty fibers over the dense subset R(U)  ⊂  U. Therefore [formula] dominates U and so the geometric generic fiber XK of XU  →  U is isomorphic to the geometric generic fiber X*K of X*U  →  U, as required.

We have seen that the Picard number of the geometric generic fiber of X'U  →  U also 1. In characteristic 0, this implies that the Picard number of X'u is also 1 for general u∈U(k). (If X'U  →  U is smooth and [formula], then [formula] implies this. The general singular case is treated in [\cite=ko-mo].) In positive characteristic, the topological arguments of [\cite=ko-mo] do not apply and I do not know if the rank of the Picard group is a constructible function for families of Fano varieties.

In our case, the following auxiliary argument does the trick.

Let Z  →  XU  ×  UX'U be the normalization of the closure of the graph of φU with projections p:Z  →  XU and p':Z  →  X'U. Let E  ⊂  Z (resp. E'  ⊂  Z) be the exceptional divisors of p (resp. p'). Then

[formula]

Since ρ(XK) = ρ(X'K) = 1, we obtain that EK and E'K have the same number of irreducible components. Similarly, for general u∈U(k), Zu is the graph of a birational map from Xu to X'u and

[formula]

Applying this to u∈R(U) we obtain that the Picard number of X'u is also 1 for general u∈R(U), as required.
