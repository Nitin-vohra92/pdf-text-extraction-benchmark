On a generalization of the support problem of Erdös and its analogues for abelian varieties and K-theory

Introduction.

If m is a positive integer then its support, denoted by [formula], is the set of prime numbers dividing m . In this paper we will prove

Let [formula] (resp. [formula]) be multiplicatively independent natural numbers such that for every natural number n. Then [formula].

and its analogues for Mordell-Weil type groups (see Corollary [\ref=wniosek_support]). Precise axiomatic setup for these groups can be found in [\cite=Bar1], below we just list those of them we consider in this paper:

O×F,S, S-units groups, where F is a number field and S is a finite set of ideals in the ring of integers OF,

A(F), Mordell-Weil groups of abelian varieties over number fields F with [formula],

K2n + 1(F), n > 0 , odd algebraic K-theory groups.

Theorem [\ref=uogolnienie_erdosa] generalizes the support problem, i.e. the following question of Pál Erdös : Let x,y  >  1 be natural numbers such that

[formula]

for every natural number n. Is then x = y? C. Corrales-Rodrigáñez and R. Schoof answered the question affirmatively by proving the following theorem (and we will prove its generalization, see Theorem [\ref=twierdzenie]): Let F be a number field and let x,y∈F*. If for almost all prime ideals p of the ring of integers of F and for all positive integers n one has

[formula]

then y is a power of x. They also proved an analogues theorem for elliptic curves and asked if it could be extended to abelian varieties. For special abelian varieties the problem was solved independently by G. Banaszak, W. Gajda and P. Kraso in [\cite=BGK2] and Ch. Khare and D. Prasad in [\cite=KP]. The final solution of that problem was given by M. Larsen in [\cite=Larsen]: Let F be a number field, OF its ring of integers, and O the coordinate ring of an open subscheme of [formula]. Let A be an abelian scheme over O and P,Q∈A(O) arbitrary sections. Suppose that for all [formula] and all prime ideals p of O, we have the implication Then there exist a positive integer k and an endomorphism φ∈EndO(A) such that φ(P)  =  kQ. In [\cite=BGK1] also an analogues result for K- theory groups of number fields was proved.

Note that since OF  /  p× is a cyclic group, the condition ([\ref=warunek_CorSch]) is equivalent to the following:

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the subgroup generated by x. However in the case of abelian varieties conditions ([\ref=warunek_CorSch]) and ([\ref=detecting]) are not equivalent. It leads to the problem of detecting linear dependence by reduction maps (see section [\ref=section_detecting]), formulated by W. Gajda in 2002 in a letter to Kenneth Ribet. The following theorem answering this question was proved by T. Weston in [\cite=We]: Let A be an abelian variety over a number field F and assume that EndFA is commutative. Let Λ be a subgroup of A(F) and suppose that P∈A(F) is such that [formula] for almost all places v of F. Then [formula]. A similar result and its analogue for K-theory groups of number fields were proved independently by G. Banaszak, W. Gajda and P. Kraso in [\cite=BGK3]. Further results in abelian varieties case were obtained by W. Gajda and K. Górnisiewicz in [\cite=GG] and recently G. Banaszak proved the following theorem in [\cite=Ban]: Let [formula] be elements of A(F) linearly independent over [formula]. Let P be a point of A(F) such that RP is a free R- module. The following conditions are equivalent: (1)   [formula] (2)   [formula] for almost all primes v of OF. In Theorem [\ref=detecting_linear_dependence] we generalize the problem of detecting linear dependence by reduction maps for Mordell-Weil type groups listed above analogously as we did it with the support problem in Theorem [\ref=twierdzenie].

Notation.

In the proofs we will use several times the following result which is a refinement of Theorem 3.1 of [\cite=BGK3]:

Let l be a prime number, [formula] a sequence of nonnegative integers. If [formula] are linearly independent points, then there is a family of primes v in F such that [formula] if ki > 0 and [formula] if ki = 0.

The support problem.

Fix one of the Mordell-Weil type group listed in the Introduction. In the following theorem all points belong to the fixed group and "linearly independent" (resp. "nontorsion") means linearly independent (resp. nontorsion) over [formula].

Let [formula] be linearly independent points and P be a nontorsion point. Suppose that for almost all primes v of OF and all natural numbers n the following condition holds :

[formula]

Then Qi = dP for some [formula] and some integer d.

Step. 1. Suppose that points [formula] are linearly independent. Fix arbitrary prime number l. By Lemma [\ref=o_posylaniu] there are infinitely many primes v such that [formula] and [formula] for all i. Set [formula]. Then [formula] but [formula] for all [formula]. Hence we get a contradiction by ([\ref=warunek]) so [formula] are linearly dependent. Step. 2. Now suppose that there exist a nonzero integer α and nonzero integers [formula] for some k  ≥  1 such that [formula] . Fix arbitrary prime number l coprime to [formula]. Since [formula] are linearly independent then by Lemma [\ref=o_posylaniu] there are infinitely many primes v such that

[formula] for [formula], [formula], [formula].

Let

[formula].

Then [formula] but [formula] hence [formula] but [formula] so [formula]. Thus [formula] and by ([\ref=warunek]) [formula] for some i so l|α . We get a contradiction so k = 0. Step. 3. By the previous step αP  =  βQi for some i and nonzero integers α,β. Now let [formula] for some prime number l and positive integer k. By Lemma [\ref=o_posylaniu] there are infinitely many primes v such that [formula] for [formula]. So [formula] for some integer m coprime to l and [formula] . Hence by ([\ref=warunek]) [formula] for some j. Thus lk|α. Since l was arbitrary we get β|α, i.e. dβP = βQi for some nonzero integer d. Step. 4. Now we repeat an argument from the proof of Theorem 3.12 of [\cite=BGK3]: Since β(dP  -  Qi) = 0 then dP  -  Qi = T is a torsion point. Suppose that T  ≠  0 and [formula] for some prime number l. Again by Lemma [\ref=o_posylaniu] there are infinitely many primes v such that [formula], [formula] for j  ≠  i. Thus by ([\ref=warunek]) we get [formula]. Hence by definition of T we have [formula]. But for almost all primes v [formula] by Lemma 3.11 of [\cite=BGK3]. By a contradiction we get T = 0.

Let [formula] (resp. [formula]) be linearly independent points such that for almost all primes v of OF and all natural numbers n

[formula]

Then there exist [formula] such that [formula].

Applying Theorem [\ref=twierdzenie] 2t-times and using assumption of linear independence we get that for every point Pi there is a unique point Qj such that Qi = kPj and Pj = lQi for some nonzero integers k,l. Hence Pj = lkPj so lk = 1. Thus [formula].

The statement comes immediately from Corollary [\ref=wniosek_support], since if x = y- 1 and [formula] then x = y = 1.

Detecting linear dependence by reduction maps.

Let B(F) denote one of the Mordell-Weil type group listed in the Introduction.

Let Λ be a subgroup of B(F) and suppose that [formula] are linearly independent points such that for almost all primes v

[formula]

Then αPi∈Λ for some [formula] and [formula].

Step. 1. Let [formula] be a basis for the nontorsion part of Λ. Suppose that [formula] are linearly independent. Choose prime number l such that l does not divide the exponent of the group [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=o_posylaniu] there are infinitely many primes v such that

[formula] for [formula], [formula] for [formula].

and by Lemma 3.11 of [\cite=BGK3] for almost all primes v we have [formula] for [formula]. Hence we get a contradiction with ([\ref=condition_detecting]) and [formula] with [formula] where not all αi and not all λj are equal to 0. Step. 2. Suppose that the assertion of the theorem does not hold. Let us for simplicity of notation reorder the points [formula] so that [formula] is a maximal subset of the set [formula] consisting of linearly independent points. Then for every Pw where [formula] there are [formula] such that

[formula]

with πw  ≠  0 and αi,w  ≠  0, λj,w  ≠  0 for some i,j. Choose prime number l coprime to all nonzero [formula] for all w and to the exponent of the group [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=o_posylaniu] there are infinitely many primes v such that

[formula] for [formula], [formula] for [formula].

Let iw be the greatest number such that αiw,w  ≠  0. Put

[formula].

Now we get by ([\ref=linear_dependence_step_2]) that nliwαiwPiw = nliwπwPw. Since nliwαiwPiw  ≠  0, we get nliwπwPw  ≠  0. Since nliw + 1αiwPiw  =  0, we have nliw + 1πwPw  =  0. Hence [formula]. By ([\ref=condition_detecting]) we get a contradiction with orders of points [formula]. So k = 0.
