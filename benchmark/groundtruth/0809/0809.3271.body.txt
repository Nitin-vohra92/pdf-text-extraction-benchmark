Continuous Measures on Homogenous Spaces

Introduction

N. Wiener gave a very simple, necessary and sufficient, condition for the support of a probability measure μ on the unit circle [formula] to contain points with positive mass. In fact, he proves the following formula ([\cite=GM79])

[formula]

This result has found many applications in various areas in mathematics; most notably in ergodic theory and optimal control theory.

In this note we extend Wiener's criterion to compact homogenous Riemannian manifolds, i.e. compact Riemannian manifolds which admit a transitive action by isometries. Our two main examples are symmetric spaces of compact type ( where other extensions of Wiener's lemma are known, due to Anoussis and Bisbas [\cite=AnBi00] ) and nilmanifolds. The Fourier coefficient of the measure is replaced with the integral of an eigenfunction of the Laplacian against the given measure. We will make use of the short-time behaviour of heat kernels on compact manifolds to deduce our results.

A Generalized Wiener Lemma

Approximations of Diagonal Measures

In this section we will briefly discuss the simple idea which lies behind this paper. Let (X,μ) be a probability space, and suppose there is a family of complex-valued measurable functions on the direct product X  ×  X, which is dominated in absolute value by some integrable function with respect to the product measure μ  ×  μ, and converges pointwise to the indicator function of the diagonal of X  ×  X. By dominated convergence,

[formula]

Suppose (X,g) is a compact Riemannian manifold. Let Δ be the Laplacian associated to the Riemann metric g. It is a well-known fact [\cite=Ch] that Δ is a positive self-adjoint operator on L2(X), with respect to the Riemannian volume measure. We let [formula] denote the eigenvalues of Δ, and [formula] the corresponding eigenfunctions, which are orthonormal in L2(X). Note that the sequence of eigenvalues is non-negative and unbounded. The heat kernel Kt is the unique solution to the equation

[formula]

with the initial condition  lim t  →  0+Kt(x,y)  =  δy(x). The heat kernel can be expressed as ( see e.g. chapter 9 in [\cite=Be] )

[formula]

If (X,g) is a compact homogenous Riemannian manifold, i.e. of the form G  /  K, where G is a Lie group, and K a closed subgroup of G, the Laplacian is equivariant under the action of G on L2(X), and thus, Kt(x,x) is independent of x∈X. If we assume that the volume has been normalized to be 1, we conclude that

[formula]

for all x∈X, since the eigenfunctions are orthonormal in L2(X). We now let

[formula]

From the above discussion, it should be clear that Ft satisfies the properties above.

If μ is a probability measure on X, we define

[formula]

We can now formulate our first result:

Let X be a compact Riemannian homogenous space. If μ is a probability measure on X, then

[formula]

In particular, if X is the standard d-dimensional torus, the lemma translates to

[formula]

where [formula] is the Fourier transform of μ and ||k|| is the l2-norm of [formula]. We will generalize this formula in two directions: To symmetric spaces of compact type and to compact Heisenberg manifolds.

Continuous Measures on Compact Lie Groups

Let G be a compact, simply connected and semisimple Lie group. It is a well-known fact [\cite=Ta] that the set of irreducible unitary representations of G is parameterized by dominant weights. We let D denote the set of dominant weights of the Lie algebra of G, and if λ is in D, we let πλ denote the associated representation and dλ the dimension of this representation. Recall that all irreducible representations are finite-dimensional. The matrix coefficients of πλ are common eigenvectors of the Casimir element restricted to the representation, and they all have the same eigenvalue, which we will denote by cλ. The character χλ is defined to be the normalized trace of πλ, and thus χλ(e)  =  1, where e is the identity in G. The heat kernel on G can be expressed as [\cite=Fe78]

[formula]

If μ is a probability measure on G, we define

[formula]

By lemma [\ref=lem:main], we now have

Let G be a compact, simply connected and semisimple Lie group, and suppose μ is a probability measure on G. Then,

[formula]

This formula should be compared to Anoussis and Bisbas result in [\cite=AnBi00]. They prove, if G is a compact semi-simple Lie group and [formula] is a sequence of subsets of dominant weights, satisfying some technical assumptions, then

[formula]

where ||  ·  || denotes the Hilbert-Schmidt norm, and

[formula]

is the operator-valued Fourier transform of μ.

The extension of the above result to symmetric spaces of compact type is straight-forward.

Continuous Measures on Nilmanifolds

The real Heisenberg group Hn is defined to be the group

[formula]

and we let Γn denote the restriction of Hn to integer points. It is a well-known fact that the quotient Xn  =  Hn  /  Γn is a compact Riemannian manifold ( the Riemann structure is induced from Euclidean structure on the Lie algebra of Hn ). The spectrum of the Laplacian on Xn was calculated by Deninger and Singhof in [\cite=DeSi84]. We will briefly recall their result. The spectrum is decomposed into two parts: the first part is parameterized by [formula] with eigenfunctions

[formula]

with eigenvalues

[formula]

The second part of the spectrum consists of eigenfunctions of the form,

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula], with eigenvalues

[formula]

Here, [formula] denotes the Hermite functions,

[formula]

As before, if μ is a probability measure on Xn, we define

[formula]

and

[formula]

We can now formulate a generalization of Wiener's lemma on the nilmanifolds Xn.

Suppose μ is a probability measure on Xn, then
