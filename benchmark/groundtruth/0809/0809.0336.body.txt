Ancilla-Assisted Discrimination of Quantum Gates

Introduction

to determine the oracle from many known candidates if the investigation into internal structures of oracle is not allowed? This is one of the central questions in theoretical computer science named as oracle identification problem or sometimes circuit verification problem.

In quantum information theory, a special case of the oracle identification problems is the discrimination of quantum states [\cite=Yuen75]. This is a fundamental task in quantum information theory since information is encoded in states and after accomplishing some quantum information tasks, information encoded in the states has to be read out, that means the final state of the system has to be determined. It is well known that perfect discrimination is possible only for orthogonal quantum states [\cite=Bennett92]. Thus, so-called unambiguous discrimination strategy is introduced for quantum states which are not necessarily mutually orthogonal [\cite=Ivanovic87] [\cite=Dieks88] [\cite=Peres88] [\cite=Jaeger95] [\cite=Chefles98] [\cite=Chefles01] [\cite=Eldar03A] [\cite=Zhang01] [\cite=Chen01] [\cite=Feng02] [\cite=Feng04] [\cite=Jafarizadeh08]. In contrast to perfect discrimination where one can always identify the state, unambiguous discrimination guarantees that except for an inconclusive probability, one can always get the correct state with zero error probability. It was shown that a set of quantum pure states are unambiguously discriminable if and only if they are linearly independent [\cite=Chefles98]. Furthermore, many variations of state discrimination problem such as local discrimination, discrimination of mixed states, discrimination of multipartite quantum states, minimum-error discrimination and asymptotic discrimination were proposed and have attracted much attention [\cite=Walgate00] [\cite=Duan0702] [\cite=Xin08] [\cite=Rudolph03] [\cite=Takeoka03] [\cite=Raynal03] [\cite=Eldar01] [\cite=Eldar03B] [\cite=Eldar04] [\cite=Schmid2008] [\cite=Markham2008]. For a comprehensive survey of state discrimination, we refer to  [\cite=Chefles00] [\cite=Paris04].

Another class of the oracle identification problems arisen in quantum information theory is the discrimination of quantum gates which is indeed closely related to the discrimination of quantum states. The problem of discriminating oracle quantum gates can be formally stated as follows. Suppose we are given an unknown quantum gate, namely a unitary operator, which is secretely chosen from a set {U1,...,Uk} of quantum gates acting on a quantum system whose state space is a d - dimensional Hilbert space Hd. The aim is to decide which one is the given gate. The discrimination of U1,...,Uk can be realized by transforming it to a corresponding problem of discriminating quantum states, more precisely, by choosing a suitable input state |ψ〉∈Hd and then discriminating U1|ψ〉,...,Uk|ψ〉.

Several variants of the problem of discriminating quantum operations have been considered in the literature. For example, unambiguous discrimination is introduced to the discrimination of quantum operations [\cite=Chefles07] [\cite=Wang06]. If we consider quantum gates acting on many particles, discrimination using local operations and classical communication is then proposed and has been extensively studied [\cite=Zhou07] [\cite=Duan07] [\cite=Duan08].

It should be remarked that, for perfect discrimination of quantum gates, it was shown that any two different quantum gates can always be perfectly discriminated if multicopy is allowed, which is quite different from perfect discrimination of quantum states, where infinite copies are required in order to attain perfect discrimination [\cite=Acin01]. Thus the multicopy strategy would greatly extends the ability to discriminate quantum gates.

In this paper, we consider another possibility of improving ability of discriminating quantum gates, namely discrimination with an ancilla system. If ancilla system is allowed, then the ability of discriminating quantum gates acting on d-dimensional Hilbert space should be improved. However, any reasonable ancilla system in practice generally cannot possibly extend to large scale. Thus we assume the dimension of ancilla system is bounded by some r  ≤  d. In this situation, we say these quantum gates can be r-assisted discriminated.

The purpose of the present paper is to address the following two questions and to explore the role ancilla system plays in discriminating among quantum oracle gates.

How many quantum gates acting on d-dimensional Hilbert space at most can be perfectly discriminated with assistance from an r-dimensional ancilla?

What is the maximum number N such that for any N quantum gates acting on d-dimensional Hilbert spaces, if they can be perfectly discriminated with some large ancilla system, then they can still be discriminated when the ancilla system is reduced to r-dimensional.

Ancilla-assisted discrimination of quantum gates is a fundamental problem in quantum information theory. Its importance is witnessed by the simple observation that the intrinsic idea of superdense coding is to find as many gates as possible such that they can be perfectly discriminated by some state [\cite=Bennett92] [\cite=mozes05]. To be more precise, let's recall the protocol for standard superdense coding. Suppose there are two parties, known as Alice and Bob, who are far away from one another. Alice possesses a p-qubit system A and Bob holds a q-qubit system B. Their goal is to transmit as much information as possible. Then Alice can send k bits of classical information to Bob using only p qubits by following procedure if there exist 2k quantum gates {Ui}2ki = 1 acting on A which can be 2q-assisted discriminable. Let Alice and Bob initially share a state [formula] which satisfies for all 1  ≤  i  ≠  j  ≤  2k. The existence of such [formula] is equivalent to 2q-assisted discriminability of these quantum gates. If Alice wishes to send the bit string '[formula]' to Bob, she applies the quantum gate [formula] to her qubits, and then sends her qubits to Bob, giving Bob possession of the whole system. Notice that for all 1  ≤  i  ≠  j  ≤  2k is equivalent to [formula] form a subset of an orthogonal basis. Thus Bob can do a measurement in this basis, and then determine which of the bit strings Alice sent. Thus the natural strategy of optimal superdense coding scheme is to find out as many unitary gates as possible, which can be perfectly discriminated with assistance from B.

The paper is structured as follows. After introducing our notations and giving some background on discrimination of quantum gates in section [\ref=section:intro], we give a straightforward and complete solution to Problem [\ref=Problem:1] in section [\ref=section:1]. Section  [\ref=section:r] is devoted to answer Problem [\ref=Problem:2]. This section is divided into two subsections. In the first subsection, we present an upper bound for Problem [\ref=Problem:2], and a lower bound for this problem is given in the second subsection. To prove the theorem concerning the lower bound, some basic ideas from algebraic geometry are required. For convenience of the reader, the necessary concepts and theorems in algebraic geometry are included in the second subsection. Finally, we conclude and present a number of open problems.

Through this paper, we focus on perfectly discrimination strategy. And for simplicity, sometimes we may use the word "discrimination" directly instead of "perfectly discrimination" without explicit explanation.

Maximal Discrimination Problem

In this section, we will answer Problem [\ref=Problem:1]. We first give a formal definition of discriminability of quantum gates.

Suppose a d-dimensional Hilbert space Hd is given, consider a set U  =  {Ui}ki = 1 of quantum gates acting on Hd.

We say U is (or U1,...,Uk are) discriminable if it (or they) will output a set of orthogonal states for some given initial input state; that is, there exists [formula] such that [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≠  j  ≤  k.

We say U is (or U1,...,Uk are) r-assisted discriminable if it is (or they are) discriminable with an r-dimensional ancilla system HR; that is, there exists a pure state [formula] such that [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≠  j  ≤  k.

The following two technical lemmas will be needed in the proof of our main theorem in this section.

k quantum gates {Ui}ki = 1 are r-assisted discriminable if and only if there exists a density operator ρ with rank ≤  r such that

Recall that a set {Mi}ki = 1 of matrices are said to be mutually orthogonal if [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≠  j  ≤  k.

k quantum gates {Ui}ki = 1 acting on a d-dimensional Hilbert space are r-assisted discriminable if and only if there exists a matrix S with rank ≤  r such that {UiS}ki = 1 are mutually orthogonal; in this case we say that {Ui}ki = 1 are discriminated by S.

Now we are able to present the main result of this section which give a complete solution to Problem 1.

If k quantum gates {Ui}ki = 1 acting on d-dimensional Hilbert space are r-assisted discriminable, then k  ≤  rd, and the upper bound rd can be achieved provided r  ≤  d.

As a simple application of the above theorem, we return back to the superdense coding scenario considered in the Introduction. With Theorem [\ref=theorem:upper], we have which follows k  ≤  p + q. Thus if Alice possesses p qubits and Bob possess q qubits, then Alice can transmit at most p + q bits of classical information to Bob using her p qubits of quantum information, this bound can be achieved provided q  ≤  p.

r-Reduced Discrimination Problem

As pointed in the Introduction, this section is entirely devoted to address Problem 2. Suppose a set U of quantum gates acting on d-dimensional Hilbert space can be perfectly discriminated with assistance from an ancilla system. In the real world, sometimes the large ancilla system is not possible in practice and what we can deal with is a small ancilla system. In this section, we assume some quantum gates can be perfectly discriminated with assistance from a large ancilla system, and our goal is to reduce the ancilla such that these quantum gates still can be perfectly discriminated with assistance from the reduced ancilla system.

A simple application of the Schmidt decomposition indicates that the quantum gates acting on d-dimensional Hilbert space can always be perfectly discriminated with assistance from a d-dimensional ancilla system; in other words, they are always d-assisted discriminable. So, it is reasonable to rephrase Problem 2 as the following more specific question:

Given a positive integer r < d. What is the maximum number N satisfying that any N d-assisted discriminable quantum gates acting on d-dimensional Hilbert space will preserve their discriminability when the ancilla system is reduced to dimension r.

We will answer this question by showing that, there exist O(r) d-assisted discriminable quantum gates acting on d-dimensional Hilbert space which cannot be r-assisted discriminated. On the other hand, there exists some constant positive number c such that for any cr quantum gates, if they are perfectly discriminable with assistance from some large ancilla system, then the discriminability remains when the ancilla system is reduced to r-dimensional.

Upper Bound of r-Reduced Discrimination problem

In this subsection, we will show the upper bound for Problem 3 in the following three steps.

Starting from a simple observation at the ancilla-free discrimination.

We will derive an upper bound [formula] for general situation.

If [formula], then our upper bound can be improved to 2r.

From above arguments it follows immediately that there always exist O(r) d-assisted discriminable quantum gates acting on d-dimensional Hilbert space which cannot be r-assisted discriminated.

Let's label the diagonals of a d  ×  d matrix by integers k, with k increasing from lower left to upper right. So there are 2d - 1 diagonals, and the i-th diagonal has d - |d - x| entries. It is easy to see that entries of Xk are all 1's in the (d - k)-th diagonal or (2d - k)-th diagonal, and all 0's in other diagonals.

There does not exist a state [formula] such that [formula] for all 0  ≤  k  ≤  d - 1 and [formula] for all 1  ≤  k  ≤  d - 1.

There exist [formula] quantum gates acting on a d-dimensional Hilbert space which are d-assisted discriminable, but cannot be perfectly discriminated if the ancilla system is not allowed.

Next, we will generalize our idea to r-dimensional ancilla-assisted case and show that there exist [formula] d-assisted discriminable quantum gates which cannot be perfectly discriminated with assistance from an r-dimensional ancilla system.

There does not exist any density operator ρ with rank ≤  r such that

[formula]

for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  r,0  ≤  j  ≤  d - 1, and

[formula]

for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  d - 1.

There exist [formula] quantum gates which are d-assisted discriminable but are not r-assisted discriminable.

The upper bound given in the above lemma can be improved in some special cases. Suppose r  ≪  d, or more specifically, [formula]. Then we have the following lemma which tightens our previous upper bound significantly.

Let [formula]. Then there are 2r + 2 quantum gates which can be d-assisted discriminated but cannot be r-assisted discriminated.

Combining Lemmas [\ref=lemma:r] and [\ref=lemma:rr], we achieve the main result of this subsection:

For any r  <  d, we can find O(r) quantum gates which can be d-assisted discriminated but cannot be r-assisted discriminated.

Lower Bound of r-Reduced Problem

We first state the main result of this subsection which presents a lower bound for Problem 3.

Any

[formula]

quantum gates which are d-assisted discriminable must also be r-assisted discriminable.

The proof of the above requires certain mathematical tools from algebraic geometry. For convenience of the reader, we first recall some definitions and results in algebraic geometry. For details, we refer to [\cite=artin91] [\cite=hartshorne77] [\cite=sha95].

Let [formula] be an affine n-space, the set of all n-tuples of complex numbers. We write [formula] for the polynomial ring in n variables. A subset of An is an algebraic set or algebraic variety if it is the common zeros of a finite set of polynomials [formula] with [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  r. Such an algebraic set is usually denoted by [formula]. It is not hard to check that the union of a finite number of algebraic sets is an algebraic set, and the intersection of any family of algebraic sets is again an algebraic set. Thus by taking the open subsets to be the complements of algebraic sets, we can define a topology, called the Zariski topology on [formula]. Notice that in some references an algebraic variety should also be irreducible in the sense that it cannot be expressed as the union of two proper algebraic sets.

Suppose we can write [formula], as a finite union of irreducible closed sets. If [formula] for all i  ≠  j, we say such a representation is irredundant, and the Xi are irreducible components of X.

We define projective n-space, denoted by [formula], to be the set of equivalence classes of (n + 1) - tuples [formula] of complex numbers, not all zero, under the equivalence relation given by [formula] for all [formula], λ  ≠  0.

A notion of algebraic variety may also be introduced in projective spaces, called projective algebraic variety: a subset Y of [formula] is an algebraic set if it is the common zeros of a finite set of homogeneous polynomials [formula] with [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  r. We call open subsets of irreducible projective varieties as quasi-projective varieties.

The variety of common zeros of r polynomials f1, [formula], fr on an n-dimensional projective variety has dimension ≥  n - r.

Let [formula] be irreducible quasiprojective varieties with dim(X) = n and dim(Y) = m. Then any (nonempty) component Z of [formula] has dim(Z)  ≥  n + m - N. Moreover, if X and Y are projective and n + m  ≥  N then [formula].

One may notice that a matrix M has rank no more than r if and only if all the determinants of its (r + 1)  ×  (r + 1) submatrices are zero. Thus all dA  ×  dB matrices with rank ≤  r can be considered as a variety, namely the determinantal variety, whose projective dimension is dAdB - (dA - r)(dB - r) - 1. Some applications of the determinantal variety in quantum information theory has been found recently [\cite=Chen06] [\cite=Cubitt08]. For more details, we refer to [\cite=Harris92].

It should be noted that above argument fails if we reduce the dimension r from 2 to 1 since only contains zero matrix. But this doesn't affect our argument very much because we can choose a proper constant coefficient c to make the lower bound hold for all r.

Theorem [\ref=theorem:lower2] can be restated as the following:

There exists a constant positive number c such that for any k  ≤  cr quantum gates, if they are d-assisted discriminable, then they are also r-assisted discriminable.

By comparing the above corollary with Theorem [\ref=theorem:upper2], it can be seen that there is indeed no gap between the lower bound and the upper bound. Thus, this corollary together with Theorem [\ref=theorem:upper2] completely answers Problem 3.

Conclusions

In this paper, we addressed the problem of ancilla-assisted perfectly discrimination of quantum gates. We evaluated the number of quantum gates which can be perfectly discriminated with an r-dimensional ancilla system. More specifically, we answered following two questions.

How many quantum gates at most can be perfectly discriminated?

Suppose a set of quantum gates can be perfectly discriminated with some ancilla system. Whether their discriminability remains if the ancilla system is reduced to a small dimension?

For the first question, it is quite simple to observe that any rd + 1 quantum gates on a d - dimensional system cannot be perfectly discriminated with assistance from an r-dimensional ancilla. And we showed that there does exist rd quantum gates on a d - dimensional system which can be perfectly discriminated with assistance from an r - dimensional ancilla.

Our results concerning the second question can be summarized as follows: (1) There exists a constant positive number c such that for any k  ≤  cr quantum gates on a d - dimensional system, if they are d-assisted discriminable, then they are also r-assisted discriminable. (2) O(r) is optimal. More precisely, there are [formula] different quantum gates on a d - dimensional system which can be d-assisted discriminated, but they cannot be perfectly discriminated if the ancilla is reduced to r-dimensional.

Discrimination problem is of widely interest because it has many surprising applications. This paper represents a preliminary step toward understanding the role ancilla system plays in discrimination of quantum gates. There are many open questions from this approach deserving further investigation. For example, we may combine our model with the multi-shot discrimination or generalize the input state to several input states as candidates.
