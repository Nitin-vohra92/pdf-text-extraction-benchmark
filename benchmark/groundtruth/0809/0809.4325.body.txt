On the Unicast Capacity of Stationary Multi-channel Multi-radio Wireless Networks: Separability and Multi-channel Routing

Introduction

It is well known that the joint capacity of independent parallel Gaussian channels with a total power constraint is equal to the sum of the capacities of the individual channels [\cite=Cover06]. Therefore, to find the joint capacity of the parallel channels, we can find the capacities of the individual channels separately, and then sum them up. We call such property separability in channels. The separability property may look trivial but it is not. In fact, when the noise is colored, i.e., dependent from channel to channel, the separability property in general does not hold [\cite=Cover06].

In this paper, we first study an analogue of the above separability property for stationary multi-channel multi-radio wireless networks. Specifically, given a multi-channel multi-radio network, we define the corresponding single-channel single-radio wireless networks, and examine whether the capacity of the multi-channel multi-radio network is equal to the sum of the capacities of those corresponding single-channel single-radio networks.

We then investigate the impact of multi-channel routing on the network capacity. In a multi-channel multi-radio network, two routing schemes can be adopted: routing a given bit either (1) on multiple channels, or (2) on only one channel while different bits may be routed through different channels. We refer to the first scheme as multi-channel routing, and the second as single-channel routing. As an example, consider the routing of bit b from source (node A1), through relays (nodes A2 and A3), to destination (node A4). When multi-channel routing is adopted, a route may look like:

[formula]

In contrast, when single-channel routing is adopted, a route may look like:

[formula]

while a different bit b' may be routed through a different channel, say, channel 3. Note that by definition multi-channel routing includes single-channel routing as a special case.

Two network models are considered: Arbitrary Network and Random Network [\cite=Kumar00]. The communication links are point-to-point with fixed data rates, and advanced techniques such as successive interference cancelation or MIMO [\cite=Tse_book05] are not considered. We assume that each node has m radio interfaces, and there are c orthogonal channels. Due to the assumed communication model, there is no benefit for a node to simultaneously transmit (or simultaneously receive) on multiple radio interfaces on the same channel. As a result, the case m  >  c reduces to the case m = c, and therefore we consider only the case m  ≤  c.

The main results are as follows:

For both Arbitrary Networks and Random Networks, given a channel assignment, the separability property of network capacity does not always hold. But if m = c, the separability property holds.

For both network models, multi-channel routing in general yields equal or a higher network capacity than single-channel routing does. But if m = c, the two routing schemes result in equal network capacities.

A striking difference of this paper from most existing work  [\cite=Kumar00][\cite=Kya05][\cite=Ma07bound][\cite=Fran07][\cite=Had07] is that this paper deals with the network capacity and not the bounds of it. Those bounds, although very useful for studying the asymptotic or rough behavior of large wireless networks, are insufficient for studying the precise relations (i.e., being equal or unequal) to be evaluated in this paper.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section [\ref=sec_not] introduces some key notations, Section [\ref=sec_arb] and Section [\ref=sec_rand] present the results for Arbitrary Networks and Random Networks, respectively, and Section [\ref=sec_implications] points out some implications of the results.

Common Notations

A multi-channel multi-radio network N is a 4-tuple (U,H,σ,η), where

U: = {1,...,n} is a set of n nodes, where each node i∈U has m radio interfaces,

H: = {1,...,c} is a set of c channels, where channel i∈H supports a fixed data rate of wi bits/sec,

σ is the region in which the nodes are located, and

η is the interference model.

A channel assignment distributes the mn radio interfaces onto the c channels. Let Ii be the set of radio interfaces of N assigned to channel i, i = 1,...c. For the network N defined above, we define c corresponding single-channel single-radio networks Ni': = (Ii,i,σ,η), i = 1,...,c. That is, Ni' consists of the radio interfaces assigned to channel i, and they can communicate only on channel i.

A network can be configured in different ways, resulting in different data delivery capabilities. Define a network configuration G as a 5-tuple (X,I,F,M,P) for network N, where

X  =  (X1,...,Xn) is the locations of the nodes, where Xi is the location of node i.

I = (I1,...,Ic) denotes the channel assignment.

F  =  (F1,...,Fn) denotes the traffic flow configuration, where Fi specifies a traffic flow originating from node i.

M denotes the routing scheme, specifying the route for any source-destination pair.

P  =  (Pij), i = 1,...n,j = 1,2,... is the transmission power configuration, where Pij specifies the transmission power of the jth transmission from node i.

Note that when m = c, the optimal channel assignment I is simple: a 1-1 mapping between a node's interfaces and the channels.

Results for Arbitrary Networks

In the Arbitrary Network model [\cite=Kumar00], node locations are arbitrary, each node arbitrarily chooses a destination, and the power level of each transmission is set arbitrarily. The network capacity is measured by transport capacity [\cite=Kumar00]. Following the convention in the communication theory that the term "capacity" refers to the supremum of a set of achievable "rates", we define transport capacity as the supremum of achievable transport rates, which is defined below.

The unicast transport rate of network N under configuration G during time interval T is defined as

[formula]

with unit bit-meters per second, where lb(G) is the distance (magnitude of the displacement) that bit b travels from source to destination under configuration G, and 〈T〉 is the set of bits delivered within time interval T.

Assume that the diameter of the region σ and the data rates wi are bounded. Then, transport rate R(G,T) is also bounded and has a unique supremum, which we define as the unicast transport capacity

[formula]

Likewise, we define the unicast transport capacity for a single-channel single-radio network Ni' in time interval T

[formula]

where Gi' configures the interfaces assigned to channel i under G. We can also define various conditional transport capacities. For example, the network capacity conditioned on a given channel assignment I is define as

[formula]

where G|I means that the channel assignment component of G is fixed at I.

A few more definitions:

A tick τi is the time required to transmit 1 bit by one hop on channel i, i.e., τi  =  1 / wi.

A Simultaneous Transmission Set (STS) of channel i is a set of successful one-hop transmissions on channel i in a tick.

Network Na is said to simulate network Nb, if there is a way for Na to replicate the delivery of all the bits delivered by Nb. The technique of simulation has been used in other places such as proving the equivalence of the Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) and the Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) [\cite=Sipser06]. We should distinguish the simulation here from what is performed by the network simulators such as the Network Simulator-2 (NS-2) [\cite=ns]. With NS-2, a single computer simulates the events that occurred in a computer network, but it does not replicate real communication.

Now we present the first result Theorem [\ref=theorem_arb_sep1] below. To understand it, note that finding the transport capacity conditioned on a channel assignment involves optimization over various configuration parameters including the locations of nodes or radio interfaces. In a multi-channel multi-radio network, all interfaces of the same node must take the same location, and we call this constraint the interface location constraint. In contrast, in the corresponding single-channel single-radio networks, which are optimized independently, there is no such constraint, therefore potentially resulting in a different conditional transport capacity.

For a multi-channel multi-radio Arbitrary Network, given the channel assignment, the transport capacity is not always separable in channels.

Proof: We prove it by showing that there exists a multi-channel multi-radio network N whose transport capacity conditioned on a channel assignment I satisfies [formula], where Ci'(T|I) are the conditional transport capacities of the corresponding single-channel single-radio networks Ni'. The network region σ is the closure of a 1 meter ×   1 meter square, n = 4, m = 2, c = 3, wi  =  1 bits/sec [formula], and the channel assignment is I = ({1,2,3,4},{1,2},{3,4}), which assigns 4 interfaces to channel 1, and 2 interfaces to each of the remaining two channels. The interference model η is the Protocol Model [\cite=Kumar00], which states that a transmission from node i to node j over some channel is successful if |Xk  -  Xi|  ≥  (1 + Δ)|Xi - Xj| for any other node k that simultaneously transmits on the same channel.

Let the optimal configuration conditioned on I of network N be G*. Since the nodes are distributed over 3 channels, there must be 3 or 4 simultaneous transmissions in N in any tick under G*: 1 or 2 simultaneous transmissions on channel 1, and 1 transmission on channel 2 and channel 3 each.

For network N, the optimal routing conditioned on channel assignment I, denoted by M* is such that each flow consists of only one hop. This way, the distance of each transmission is fully accounted in the transport rate while the maximum number of simultaneous transmissions can be achieved. As a result, [formula], where [formula] with 〈T,i〉 defined as the set of bits delivered on channel i in T. By the definition of Ci'(T|I), we have Ri(G*,T)  ≤  Ci'(T|I), and hence

[formula]

Now consider the optimal configurations Gi'* of the corresponding single-channel single-radio networks Ni', i = 1,2,3. It is clear that G2'* is to place nodes 1 and 2 at the opposite ends of a diagonal of square σ and let one node transmit a time, and G3'* is similar. To achieve the equality in ≤   in ([\ref=eq_proof1]), we must have Ri(G*,T)  =  Ci'(T) for all i = 1,2,3, which, however, is impossible for some Δ as shown next.

Suppose that G* satisfies Ri(G*,T)  =  Ci'(T|I) for i = 2,3. Under G*, the interfaces in network N assigned to channels 2 and 3 must be at the corners of square σ. Because those interfaces come from all four nodes, the remaining interfaces, which are on channel 1, will also be at the corners. Choose Δ  >  0 in the Protocol Model such that G1'* allows two simultaneous transmissions on channel 1. It can be checked that placing all nodes at the corners of square σ violates the constraints imposed by the Protocol Model and therefore cannot be optimal for N1'. Thus R1(G*,T)  <  C1'(T|I). By ([\ref=eq_proof1]), [formula]. [formula]

Note: In the above proof, interference models other than the Protocol Model can be used as well if they are equivalent to the Protocol Model for the particular network considered there. The Interference Model [\cite=Kumar00] is one of them.

We next show that if m = c, the transport capacity of any Arbitrary Network is separable in channels.

For an Arbitrary Network, if the number of radio interfaces at each node is equal to the number of channels, i.e., if m = c, the separability property holds, i.e., [formula] as T  →    ∞  .

Proof: (a) We first show that [formula]. At first glance, it seems that any combined configuration G1'  ×  ...  ×  Gc' is a special case of G. However, there are two subtle difficulties here. The first one is the interface location constraint mentioned before. With any feasible G, the interfaces of the same node must have the same location, which is not guaranteed if the interface locations of single-channel single-radio networks Ni' are optimized independently. The second is the source-destination pair selection. If the selections are done independently, the same node may select different destinations on Nl' and Nk' for l  ≠  k. The difficulties are resolved by noting that the only difference between networks Ni' is in the data rates wi. Thus, any sequence of STS's that occurred in one network Nl' can occur in the same order in any other network Nk', and the only difference is in the pace (proportional to wi) at which the sequences occur. Therefore, the optimal configurations Gl' and Gk' are the same except for a constant scaling factor in time, making G1'*  ×  ...  ×  Gc'* a special case of G. By the definition of C(T), we have

[formula]

(b) We now show [formula] as T  →    ∞   by showing that any sequence of STS's of network N can be simulated by networks Ni', i = 1,...c, essentially in the same amount of time. Partition T into disjoint intervals Tj

[formula]

For any configuration G, it is clear that [formula].

The simulation scheme is as follows: network Nj' simulates the STS's that occurred on network N during time interval Tj, j = 1,...,c, and the c simulations run simultaneously. That is, networks Nj' each replicate a segment of the history of N in parallel. There is an important dependence among the STS's of network N. Consider a bit that is forwarded by one hop in the current STS. This hop of forwarding contributes to the transport capacity only if the previous STS's have completed the previous hops of forwarding. To preserve this dependence, network Nj' schedules the STS's in the same order they were completed in network N in Tj. This is illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig_simulate]. In network N during T1, 4 STS's (numbered 1, 3, 5, 7) occurred on channel 1, 1 STS (numbered 4) on channel 2, and 2 STS's (numbered 2, 6) on channel 3. The numeric order sequences the time instants at which the STS's were completed on network N. N1' simulates all 7 STS's according to the numeric order. This way, N1' delivers whatever bits that were delivered by network N during T1 and preserves the dependence among those bits. In general, the schedule is obtained as follows. Define Lij: = ⌈Tj  /  τi⌉, the number of STS's completed on channel i during Tj. Define [formula], j = 1,...,c. That is, Λj includes all the time instants at which the STS's were completed on network N during Tj. Sorting Λj in ascending order forms the schedule for network Nj'.

To simulate the deliveries in 〈Tj〉, it takes network Nj' time

[formula]

where ([\ref=eq_a1]) follows from ([\ref=eq_Tj]) and that τi  =  1 / wi. Also, note that sj  ≥  T because Lij  =  ⌈Tj  /  τi⌉  ≥  Tj  /  τi. We obtain the following bounds

[formula]

Define : =  max j{sj}. Then T  ≤    <  T  +  c max j{τj}. After an elapse of [formula], bit-meters in the amount of [formula] are achieved collectively by networks Nj', and the transport rate is

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

where ([\ref=eq_use_def_c]) follows from the definition of Cj'(T). Combining ([\ref=eq_use_def_c]) and ([\ref=eq_R'1]) gives

[formula]

and hence, by the definition of C(T),

[formula]

By (a) and (b), we have [formula], as T  →    ∞  . [formula]

Note: If we use a different simulation scheme, we may run into the following difficulty. When the multi-channel multi-radio network routes a bit through different channels, the transmissions simulated on Ni' may be disconnected, and thus do not contribute to the transport capacity Ci'(T), which must be solely evaluated on Ni'.

So far, we have considered c + 1 networks: a multi-channel multi-radio network, and the c corresponding single-channel single-radio networks. We next consider only one network (a multi-channel multi-radio network) but two routing schemes.

For an Arbitrary Network, given a channel assignment I, let the transport capacity under multi-channel routing be [formula], and let the transport capacity under single-channel routing be [formula]. Then (1) [formula], [formula] and I, (2) [formula] and I such that [formula], and (3) if m = c, the two routing schemes result in equal capacities, i.e., [formula] as T  →    ∞  .

Proof: (1) This is true because single-channel routing is a special case of multi-channel routing.

(2) This is true because with multi-channel routing, some connected links that are on different channels can be used to deliver extra bits. Consider network N consisting of n = 5 nodes A, B, C, D and E, σ being a circular disk, m = 3, and c = 9. The channel assignment I, in the form of "(node: list of channels to which that node's interfaces are assigned)", is (A: 1,2,6), (B:3,4,7), (C:1,2,8), (D:3,5,6), (E:4,5,9). The data rates of the channels are wi = 2,i = 1,...,4, and wi = 1,i = 5,...,9. Given I, the optimal configuration is shown in Fig. [\ref=mr_sr_arbi_fig] and is justified as follows. Node C must choose node A as its destination, since node A is the only node with which node C can communicate. Node A can communicate with node C on channel 1 or channel 2 and node D on channel 6. Since data rates w1,w2  >  w6, node A should choose node C as its destination. To maximize the contribution to the transport capacity, node A and node C must be at the opposite ends of a diameter, say d1. Node D can communicate with node B on channel 3 and with node A on channel 6. Since w3  >  w6, node D should choose node B as its destination. To maximize the contribution to the transport capacity, node D and node B must be at the opposite ends of another diameter d2. Now since the only remaining idle link at node B is B↔  E on channel 4, node B should choose node E as its destination. To maximize the contribution to the transport capacity, node E must be at the end of diameter d2 that is opposite node B, and thus node E is collocated with node D.

Note that under multi-channel routing, node E, node D and node A form a path E→  D→  A traversing channel 5 and channel 6. Since node E and node D are collocated, node E should choose node A as its destination. To maximum the contribution to the transport capacity, node A must be at the end of diameter d2 that is opposite node E. Note that node A is also on diameter d1. Thus diameter d1 and diameter d2 overlap. The path E→  D→  A, which makes a positive contribution to the transport capacity, is forbidden under single-channel routing. Therefore, for network N, multi-channel routing yields a higher transport capacity, i.e., [formula].

(3) Now if m = c, we view all the interfaces on channel j as a single-channel single-radio network Nj. Then, by following part (b) of the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem_sep], the STS's under multi-channel routing can be simulated by the c networks Nj in parallel. Thus, [formula], as T  →    ∞  , which together with [formula] completes the proof. [formula]

Results for Random Networks

In a Random Network [\cite=Kumar00], nodes are randomly located in a region. Each node randomly chooses another node as its destination, and as a result there are n traffic flows in the network. The measure of network capacity is the throughput capacity [\cite=Kumar00], which is in the minimum sense since according to [\cite=Kumar00] a throughput is defined to be feasible (i.e., to be admitted in evaluating the order behavior) if all nodes can achieve it. In some scenarios, it might be beneficial to consider the average of the actual throughputs of all nodes, and this prompts us to define the average-sense (AS) throughput capacity. We call the one in [\cite=Kumar00] the minimum-sense (MS) throughput capacity. For the purpose of clarity, we give the definitions of both. But first we define the throughput of a flow originating from node j during time interval T

[formula]

with unit bits/second, where configuration G = (X,I,F,M,P) is defined in Section [\ref=sec_not] and N(G,T,j) is the number of bits delivered by the flow originating from node j in a duration of T. Now we define the minimum-sense (MS) throughput rate under G as

[formula]

where n factors in the network size, and define the minimum-sense (MS) throughput capacity as

[formula]

where [formula] means taking the expected value with respect to X and F, which are both uniform in their respective domains. We can define various conditional throughput capacities. For example, we define minimum sense (MS) throughput capacity conditioned on channel assignment I as

[formula]

We define the average-sense (AS) throughput rate as

[formula]

As in the minimum sense case, we can also define the average-sense (AS) throughput capacity and the the average-sense (AS) throughput capacity conditioned on a channel assignment, but we leave them out for brevity. It is clear that the AS throughput capacity is not less than the MS throughput capacity. As in Section [\ref=sec_arb], the corresponding single-channel single-radio networks Nj' and their various throughput capacities can be defined as well.

For a Random Network, given a channel assignment, the throughput capacity in general is not separable in channels, regardless of whether the throughput capacity is in the minimum sense or in the average sense.

Proof: This is true because a flow in a single-channel single-radio network tends to have fewer hops and consequently a transmission may contribute more to the throughput capacity than a transmission in a multi-channel multi-radio network does. We prove this by showing the existence of a network N whose throughput capacity conditioned on a channel assignment I is not separable in channels. The network N consists of n = 4 nodes A, B, C and D, m = 2, c = 4, wi = 1 bits/sec where i = 1,...,4, and the channel assignment I is (A:1,2), (B:2,3), (C:3,4), (D:4,1).

We first consider the MS throughput capacity. Under channel assignment I, each of the corresponding single-channel single-radio networks Ni consists of two radio interfaces, and has a MS throughput capacity of 1 bits/sec since sup 0  ≤  x  ≤  12 min {x,1 - x} = 1. Therefore, [formula] bits/sec.

In network N, each node can choose one of the three other nodes as its destination, resulting in 34 = 81 flow configurations. Let the throughput capacity conditioned on I and flow configuration F be C(T|I,F). It can be checked that C(T|I,F) is maximized if F is either Fα = (A→  B, B→  C, C→  D, D→  A) or the reverse Fβ  =  (B→  A, C→  B, D→  C, A→  D), each of which results in a C(T|I,F) of 4 bits/sec. Now consider another flow configuration: Fγ  =  (A→  B→  C, B→  C, C→  D, D→  A), which occurs with probability 1 / 81. Let the throughput of flow A→  B→  C be x bits/sec, where 0  ≤  x  ≤  1, then the throughput of flow B→  C is 1 - x. The minimum of x and 1 - x is 0.5 attained at x = 0.5. The throughputs of the other two flows C→  D, D→  A are both 1 bits/sec. Thus the minimum of the throughputs is 0.5 bits/sec, and C(T|I,Fγ)  =  4  ×  0.5 = 2 bits/ec. Therefore, [formula].

We now consider the AS throughput capacity. It can be checked that [formula] bits/sec. Also, C(T|I,F) is maximized at flow configurations Fα and Fβ defined above. Now consider flow configurations: Fδ = (A→  B→  C, B→  C→  D, C→  D→  A, D→  A→  B), each flow having two hops. Due to symmetry, each flow has a throughput of 0.5 bits/sec, and C(T|I,Fδ)  =  4  ×  0.5 = 2 bits/ec. Following the argument in the case of MS throughput capacity, we have [formula]. [formula]

We next show that if m = c, the throughput capacity of any Random Network is separable in channels.

For a Random Network, if m = c, the throughput capacity is separable in channels, i.e., [formula] as T  →    ∞  .

Proof: Fix X and F, and set the distance of each hop to 1, by the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem_sep], we have [formula]. Taking the expectation over X and F completes the proof. [formula]

For a Random Network, given a channel assignment I, let the throughput capacity under multi-channel routing be [formula], and let the throughput capacity under single-channel routing be [formula]. Then (1) [formula], [formula] and I, (2) [formula] and I such that [formula], and (3) if m = c, the two routing schemes result in equal capacities, i.e., [formula] as T  →    ∞  .

Proof: (1) This is true because single-channel routing is a special case of multi-channel routing.

(2) We first prove the result for the MS throughput capacity. The result is true because the definition of MS throughput capacity may penalize single channel routing. Consider network N consisting of 3 nodes A, B and C, m = 2, c = 4. The channel assignment I is (A: 1,2), (B:2,3), and (C:3,4). There are 8 possible flow configurations, since each node can choose one of the two other nodes as its destination. Under single-channel routing, among those flow configurations, (A  →  B, B  →  A, C  →  B) and (A  →  B, B  →  C, C  →  B) have conditional throughput capacity C(T|I,F)  =  1 / 2, and the other flow configurations have a conditional throughput capacity of 0. Thus, [formula]. Under multi-channel routing, the first two flow configurations have the same conditional throughput capacity as they do under single-channel routing. Consider a third flow configuration (A  →  B, B  →  C, C  →  A), which has a throughput capacity of 1 / 2 > 0. Thus, [formula].

We now prove it for the AS throughput capacity. The result is true because with multi-channel routing, some connected links that are on different channels can be used to deliver extra bits. Refer to Table [\ref=table_rand_mr_as] for the network N under consideration. Network Nconsists of 5 nodes A, B, C, D and E, m = 2, c = 4, w1 = 1 bits/s, w2 = 6 bits/s, w3 = 10 bits/s, w4 = 1 bits/s. The channel assignment I is (A: 1,2), (B:2,3), (C:3,4), (D:1,3), and (E:1,4). For flow configuration Fα  =  (A  →  C, C  →  A, D  →  A, B  →  E, E  →  D), under single-channel routing, the throughputs are 0, 0, ≤  1, 0, and ≤  1, respectively, resulting in [formula]. Under multi-channel routing, consider the following routing scheme: ([formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula]). The first three flows have an aggregate throughput of 6, and the remaining two both have 1, resulting in an aggregate throughput of 8 and hence [formula]. For any other flow configuration Fβ, [formula]. Taking the expected value of flow configuration completes the proof.

(3) If m = c, fix X and F, and set the distance of each hop to 1, by the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem_rt], we have [formula], as T  →    ∞  . Taking the expectation of X and F completes the proof. [formula]

Note: It can be shown that for the first network in part (2) of the above proof, the AS throughput capacity under two routing schemes are equal, which together with the proof demonstrates the difference between AS throughput capacity and MS throughput capacity.

Implications of the Results

The results of this paper apply to networks of any size, including practical networks, which have a limited number of nodes.

An implication of the separability property is that if we know the formula for calculating the capacity of single-channel single-radio networks, in general we cannot calculate the capacity of a multi-channel multi-radio network by adding up the capacities of the corresponding single-channel single-radio networks. However, if the number of interfaces at each node is equal to the number of channels, this calculation is correct.

Another implication of the separability property is that if the number of interfaces at each node is equal to the number of channels, the network capacity linearly increases with the number of interfaces at each node.

An implication of the results on multi-channel routing is that allowing a packet to be routed to a channel different from the channel on which the packet is received may improve the network capacity. However, if the number of interfaces at each node is equal to the number of channels, this routing scheme does not improve the network capacity.

This paper does not answer the question of how to achieve the network capacity. To provide the answer, a multi-commodity flow problem can be formulated [\cite=Kod05]. However, the solution is computationally hard and only heuristic solutions have been found.
