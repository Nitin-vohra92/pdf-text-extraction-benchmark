Since Yang and Mills founded non-Abel gauge field theory in 1954 [ 1 ], gauge field theory has been extensively applied to elementary particle theory. But we know that, if gauge symmetry is strictly preserved in the Yang-Mills gauge field theory, the masses of gauge bosons should be zero. The introduction of spontaneously symmetry breaking and Higgs mechanism make it possible for physicists to construct electroweak model by using gauge theory. In the sixties, Glashow [ 2 ] , Weinberg [ 3 ] and Salam [ 4 ] founded the unified electroweak standard model. The gauge bosons W± and Z which are predicted by the standard model have been found by experiment. But Higgs particle, which is necessary for the standard model, has not been found until now [ 5 ] .

Using the gauge field theory which has massive gauge bosons[ 6-7 ], we could construct an electroweak model without using Higgs mechanism. The fundamental characteristics of the new electroweak model are: (1) there exists no Higgs particle in the theory; (2) the interaction properties of the new theory are the same as those of the standard model, and in a proper limit, this model will approximately return to the standard model; and (3) there exist two sets of gauge bosons in the theory, one set contains W±, ~ Z and photon which we are familiar with, another set contains only massless gauge bosons. In the new electroweak model, some physical arguments, such as the structures of neutral current and charged currents, the masses of intermediate bosons W± and Z , the coupling constant of electromagnetic interactions , etc., are completely the same as those in the standard model. In a word, except for Higgs particle and those terms concern Higgs particle, all other properties are inherited by the new model.

Now, let's discuss the electroweak interactions of leptons. Let e represent e,μ or τ, and ν represent the corresponding neutrinos νe,νμ or ντ. Suppose that leptons e and ν form a left-hand doublet ψL and a right-hand singlet eR. The definitions of ψL and eR are the same as those in standard model. At the same time, in order to obtain the masses of W± and Z, we need four kinds of gauge fields. There are two kinds of gauge fields F1μ and F2μ which correspond to SU(2)L symmetry and two kinds of gauge fields B1μ and B2μ which correspond to U(1)Y symmetry.

Usually in lagrangian, the mass terms have the following forms

[formula]

where μ and m are mass parameters. If we hope that there exist no parameters which have mass dimension, we could change the above terms into the following forms

[formula]

with v a potential which has mass dimension. We name it a vacuum potential for the moment. The vacuum potential v has no dynamical terms. We know that the SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y symmetry is an approximate symmetry. Later, we will introduce symmetry breaking through vacuum potential v.

The lagrangian of the model is

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The lagrangian density defined by eqs.(3-6) has strict local SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y gauge symmetry.

The symmetry breaking of the model is accomplished through the change of the vacuum potential. We could suppose that the lagrangian defined by eq.(3-6) describes a state of matter which exists in a condition of extreme high temperature. This state is a special phase of vacuum and may exist at a moment of Big Bang. Alone with the decreasing of the temperature of the state, the phase transition of the vacuum occurs. After phase transition, the vacuum potential changes into:

[formula]

Gauge fields F1μ,F2μ,B1μ and B2μ are not eigenvectors of mass matrix. In order to obtain the eigenvectors of mass matrix, let's first make the following transformations:

[formula]

then make transformations:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

After the above transformations, the lagrangian densities change into:

[formula]

[formula]

where, LgI only contains interaction terms of gauge fields. In the above relations, we have used the following notations: if Aμ is a non-Abel gauge field, then

[formula]

if Aμ is an Abel gauge field, then

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

From eqs (18-19), we know that, the mass of lepton e is [formula], the mass of neutrino is still zero, the masses of the charged gauge bosons W± are mW  =  μ cosθ, the mass of neutral gauge boson Z is [formula] and the masses of gauge fields A,A2,Z2,W±2 are all zero. The current structures in the model are completely the same as those in the standard model. At the same time, we notice that, there exist two different electromagnetic fields Aμ and A2μ, so there exist two different coupling constants of electromagnetic interactions.

[formula]

The real electromagnetic field in nature should be a mixture of these two electromagnetic fields Aμ and A2μ, so the effective coupling constant of the electromagnetic interactions should be

[formula]

From this relation, we see that the value of the parameter α doesn't affect the value of the effective coulping constant of electromagnetic interactions. Once again, we have noticed that the expression of effective coupling constant e of the electromagnetic interactions is completely the same as that in the standard model.

If the parameter α is small, then in the leading term approximation, except for the terms concern Higgs particle, the lagrangian density defined by eqs(18-19) will return to the lagrangian density of the standard model. Because the standard model is consonant well with high energy experiments, we could anticipate that the parameter α is small.

Experimentally speaking, if these five kinds of massless gauge bosons introduced in this paper exist in nature, some of them might be regarded as γ photon. The gauge boson Z2 have similar interaction properties to those of γ photon, and they have the same mass, so it is hard to distinguish between γ photon and Z2 boson in experiment. If experimental physicists find that γ photon takes part in weak interactions, that means that there exists Z2 boson mixed in γ photon. Those charged massless gauge bosons W±2 might be regarded as charged photon or other light charged particles. (Such as electron suppose that simultaneously create an invisible neutrino) It is an important work to verify the existence of these massless gauge bosons.

Just revised the standard model and introduce another set of gauge bosons, we could found a theory which simultaneously contains Higgs particle and those massless gauge bosons. So, Higgs particle and massless gauge bosons could exist in the same theory. But, if these massless gauge bosons were found by experiment, Higgs particle is no longer needed in thoery. The reason for the introduction of Higgs particle does not exist.

Some properties of vacuum potential are similar to those of Higgs field, but they have essential differences. The most important difference is that vacuum potential has no kinematical energy term in the lagrangian. It has no dynamics. All these are properties of vacuum, so we name it vacuum potential. We could consider it from another point of view. We know that vacuum can be regarded as sea of virtual particle. It has interactions with physical particle. This kind of interactions change the mass of physical particle(see for example mass renormalization). So, if a naked particle is massless, it could obtain mass through its interactions with vacuum. That is the physical interpretation of eq(2) and could be regarded particially as the origin of mass. The properties of vacuum are not stable forever. With the change of the properties of vacuum, the symmetry of physical system will change accordingly and the symmetry breaking occurs [ 9 ]. In this paper, we use v to denote the influences of vacuum to physical fields.

We have clearly known that there exist two kinds of long-range force fields in nature: electromagnetic field and gravitation field. According to this paper, there may exist the third long-range force field. The third long-range force field is weak field which is transmitted by Z2 boson. The influences of weak long-range force may be weakened by the adsorption of neutrino in matter, because the adsorption of neutrino in matter will make the object in a state of weak charge neutral. This long-range force might have some influences in cosmology.

We could construct a lot of electroweak models by using Higgs mechanism, but we could construct only one electroweak model by using vacuum potential. So, in the new theory, the interaction properties are more fixed by the requirement of gauge symmetry. This property is important theoretically.
