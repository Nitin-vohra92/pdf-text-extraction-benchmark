QCD Predictions for gp1 at Small x Incorporating Double ln 2(1 / x) Resummation J. Kwieciski, B. Ziaja Department of Theoretical Physics, H. Niewodniczaski Institute of Nuclear Physics, Cracow, Poland

It has recently been pointed out that the spin dependent structure function g1 at low x is dominated by the double logarithmic ln 2(1 / x) contributions i.e. by those terms of the perturbative expansion which correspond to the powers of ln 2(1 / x) at each order of the expansion [\cite=BARTNS] [\cite=BARTS]. Those contributions go beyond the LO or NLO order QCD evolution of polarised parton densities [\cite=AP] and in order to take them into account one has to include the resummed double ln 2(1 / x) terms in the coefficient and splitting functions [\cite=RG]. In ref. [\cite=BBJK] we have developed an alternative approach based on unitegrated distributions which for simplicity was formulated for the non-singlet distributions. In this note we wish to present the preliminary results for the singlet structure functions concentrating on the proton polarized structure function gp1(x,Q2). Our main aim is to study gp1(x,Q2) in the region of the small values of x which can possibly be probed at HERA [\cite=ALBERT] and confront obtained results with those obtained from the LO Altarelli-Parisi evolution. We will also show similar results for the polarised gluon distribution ΔG(x,Q2).

The dominant contribution to the double ln 2(1 / x) resummation comes from the ladder diagrams with quark and gluon exchanges along the ladder. In what follows we shall neglect for simplicity possible non-ladder bremsstrahlung terms which are relatively unimportant [\cite=BARTNS] [\cite=BARTS].

It is convenient to introduce the unintegrated (spin dependent) parton distributions [formula] (i = uv,dv,ū,,s̄,g) where k2 is the transverse momentum squared of the parton i and [formula] the longitudinal momentum fraction of the parent proton carried by a parton. The conventional (integrated) distributions Δpi(x,Q2) are related in the following way to the unintegrated distributions [formula]:

[formula]

where Δp(0)i(x) is the nonperturbative part of the of the distributions and

[formula]

where as usual x is the Bjorken parameter and Q2 =  - q2 with q denoting the four momentum transfer between leptons. The parameter k20 is the infrared cut-off which will be set equal to 1 GeV2. The origin of the nonperturbative part Δp(0)i(x) can be viewed upon as originating from the non-perturbative region k2  <  k20, i.e.

[formula]

The spin dependent structure function gp1(x,Q2) of the proton is related in a standard way to the (integrated) parton distributions:

[formula]

where Δuv(x,Q2)  =  Δpuv(x,Q2) etc. We assume Δū  =  Δ and confine ourselves to the number of flavours NF equal to three.

The valence quarks distributions and asymmetric part of the sea

[formula]

will correspond to ladder diagrams with quark exchange along the ladder. The singlet distributions

[formula]

and the gluon distributions [formula] will correspond to ladder diagrams with both quark (antiquark) and gluon exchanges along the ladder.

The sum of double logarithmic ln 2(1 / x) terms corresponding to ladder diagrams is generated by the following integral equations:

[formula]

(k = uv,dv,US)

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

with ΔPij(0)  =  ΔPij(z = 0) where ΔPij(z) denote the LO splitting functions describing evolution of spin dependent parton densities and the inhomogeneous terms [formula] will be specified later. To be precise we have:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=dlxns]) is similar to the corresponding equation in QED describing the double logarithmic resummation generated by ladder diagrams with fermion exchange [\cite=QED]. The problem of double logarithmic asymptotics in QCD in the non-singlet channels was also discussed in ref [\cite=QCD].

Equations ([\ref=dlxns], [\ref=dlxsg]) generate singular power behaviour of the spin dependent parton distributions and of the spin dependent structure functions g1 at small x i.e.

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where gNS1 = gp1 - gn1 and gS1 = gp1 + gn1 respectively and ΔG is the spin dependent gluon distribution. This behaviour reflects similar small [formula] behaviour of the unintegrated distributions. Exponents λNS,S are given by the following formulas:

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

Both equations ([\ref=dlxns],[\ref=dlxsg]) and the exponents λNS,S acquire additional contributions from the non-ladder diagrams which are however relatively small [\cite=BARTNS] [\cite=BARTS]. The power-like behaviour ([\ref=lambda]) remains the leading small x behaviour of the structure functions provided that their non-perturbative parts are less singular. This takes place if the latter are assumed to have the Regge pole like behaviour with the corresponding intercept(s) being near 0.

Following ref. [\cite=BBJK] we extend equations ([\ref=dlxns],[\ref=dlxsg]) and add to their right hand side the contributions coming from the remaining parts of the splitting functions ΔPij(z). We also allow the coupling αs to run setting k2 as the relevant scale. In this way we obtain unified system of equations which contain both the complete LO Altarelli-Parisi evolution and the double logarithmic ln 2(1 / x) effects at low x. The corresponding system of equations reads:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

(k = uv,dv,US),

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The inhomogeneous terms [formula] are expressed in terms of the input (integrated) parton distributions and are the same as in the case of the LO Altarelli Parisi evolution [\cite=BBJK]:

[formula]

[formula]

(k = uv,dv,US),

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Equations ([\ref=unifns],[\ref=unifsg]) together with ([\ref=fns0],[\ref=fsg0]) and ([\ref=dpi]) reduce to the LO Altarelli-Parisi evolution equations with the starting (integrated) distributions Δp0i(x) after we set the upper integration limit over [formula] equal to k2 in all terms in equations ([\ref=unifns],[\ref=unifsg]) and if we set Q2 in place of W2 as the upper integration limit in the integral in eq. ([\ref=dpi]).

We solved equations ([\ref=unifns],[\ref=unifsg]) assuming the following simple parametrisation of the input distributions:

[formula]

where we set ηuv  =  ηdv = 3, ηū  =  ηs̄  =  7 and ηg = 5. The normalisation constants Ni were determined by imposing the Bjorken sum-rule for Δu(0)v  -  Δd(0)v and requiring that the first moments of all other distributions are the same as those determined from the recent QCD analysis [\cite=STRATMAN]. All distributions Δp(0)i(x) behave as x0 in the limit x  →  0 that corresponds to the implicit assumption that the Regge poles which correspond to axial vector mesons, which should control the small x behaviour of g1 [\cite=REGGE] have their intercept equal to 0. We checked that the parametrisation ([\ref=dpi0]) combined with equations ([\ref=dpi],[\ref=gp1],[\ref=unifns],[\ref=unifsg]) gives reasonable description of the recent SMC data on gp1(x,Q2) [\cite=SMC].

In Fig.1 we show gp1(x,Q2) for Q2  =  10GeV2 in the small x region which can possibly be probed at HERA. We show predictions based on the equations ([\ref=unifns],[\ref=unifsg],[\ref=dpi]) and confront them with the expectations which follow from solving the LO Altarelli-Parisi evolution equations with the input distributions at Q20 = 1GeV2 given by equation(s) ([\ref=dpi0]). We also show in this Figure the "experimental" points which were obtained from the extrapolations based on the NLO QCD analysis together with estimated statistical errors [\cite=ALBERT]. We see that the structure function gp1(x,Q2) which contains effects of the double ln 2(1 / x) resummation begins to differ from that calculated within the LO Altarelli Parisi equations already for x  ~  10- 3. It is however comparable to the structure function obtained from the NLO analysis for x > 10- 4 which is indicated by the "experimental" points. This is presumably partially an artifact of the difference in the input distributions but it also reflects the fact that the NLO approximation contains the first two terms of the double ln 2(1 / x) resummation in the corresponding splitting and coefficient functions. It can also be seen from Fig.1 that the (complete) double ln 2(1 / x) resummation generates the structure function which is significantly steeper than that obtained from the NLO QCD analysis and the difference between those two extrapolations becomes significant for x  <  10- 4.

In Fig. 2 we show our predictions for the polarized gluon distribution ΔG(x,Q2)  =  Δpg(x,Q2) for Q2 = 10GeV2 and confront it with the polarized gluon distribution obtained from the LO Altarelli-Parisi equations. The gluon distributions exhibits characteristic x-  λS behaviour with λS  ~  1. Similar behaviour is exhibited by the structure function gp1(x,Q2) itself.

To sum up we have presented results of the analysis of the "unified" equations which contain the LO Altarelli Parisi evolution and the double ln 2(1 / x) effects at low x. As the first approximation we considered those double ln 2(1 / x) effects which are generated by ladder diagrams. The double logarithmic effects were found to be very important and they should in principle be visible in possible HERA measurements (cf. Fig. 1).
