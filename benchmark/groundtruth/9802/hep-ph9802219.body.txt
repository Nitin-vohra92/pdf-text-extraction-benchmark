Muon-proton Colliders: Leptoquarks and Contact Interactions

Introduction

Recently, the muon collider has received a lot of attentions [\cite=rd]. The muon collider of a few hundred GeV center-of-mass energy is considered a Higgs factory [\cite=report], where interactions and branching ratios of the Higgs boson can be studied in detail. It is also an excellent place to study the top-quark near the threshold region [\cite=precision]. Other physics opportunities include precision studies of gauge bosons [\cite=precision], search for supersymmetry and lepton-number violation, and other new physics. Muon colliders in TeV range should be feasible for studying strong electroweak symmetry breaking [\cite=strong], lepton-number violation, and search for heavy exotic particles.

The R&D [\cite=rd] [\cite=fmc] of the muon collider is underway. The First Muon Collier (FMC) will have a 200 GeV muon beam on a 200 GeV anti-muon beam, which could possibly be at the Fermilab [\cite=fmc]. With the existing Tevatron proton beam the muon-proton collision becomes a possible option. It would be a 200 GeV [formula] 1 TeV μp collider, where the first energy is the energy of the muon beam and the second energy is the proton beam energy. The existing lepton-proton collider is the ep collider at HERA. Lepton-proton colliders have been proved to be successful by the physics results from HERA. In this work, we shall discuss the physics potential of the μp colliders at various energies and luminosities. Other μp colliders that we are considering are 50 GeV [formula] 1 TeV, 1 TeV [formula] 1 TeV, and 2 TeV [formula] 3 TeV. The center-of-mass energies and luminosities of these various designs are summarized in Table [\ref=table1]. The nominal yearly luminosity of the 200 GeV [formula] 1 TeV μp collider is about 13 fb- 1. Luminosities for other designs are roughly scaled by one quarter power of the muon beam energy and given in Table [\ref=table1].

Physics Potential

The physics opportunities of μp colliders are similar to those of ep colliders, but the sensitivity reach might be very different, which depends on how precise the particles can be identified and measured in ep and μp environments. Similar to ep colliders the proton structure functions can be measured to very large Q2 and small x in μp colliders of higher energies. At HERA, the Q2 has been measured up to Q2≃104 GeV2 and x down to x  ~  3  ×  10- 4. At the 200 GeV [formula] 1 TeV μp collider the Q2 can be measured up to 106 GeV2. In addition, QCD studies, search for supersymmetry and other exotic particles can be carried out at the μp colliders. Here we are particularly interested in the leptoquarks, leptogluons, R-parity violating squarks, and the contact interactions that are specific to the muon. The goal here is to estimate the sensitivity reach for these new physics at various energies and luminosities.

Leptoquarks

The second generation leptoquarks made up of a muon and a charm or strange quark are particularly interesting at the μp collider because they can be directly produced in the s-channel processes, e.g.,

[formula]

It is conventional to assume no inter-generational mixing in order to prevent the dangerous flavor-changing neutral currents. The s-channel production will give spectacular enhancement in the invariant mass M of the muon and the hadronic final state, or the x = s / M2 distribution.

The Lagrangian of the second generation leptoquark with the muon and charm and strange quarks is given by

[formula]

where q = c,s and the superscripts (0,1) on the leptoquark field denote the scalar and the vector leptoquarks, respectively. The production cross section of the leptoquark at the μp collider is given by

[formula]

where J is the spin of the leptoquark and q(x,Q2) is the parton luminosity.

Leptogluons

A leptogluon has a spin of either 1 / 2 or 3 / 2, a lepton quantum number (in this case it is the muon), and a color quantum number (the same as gluon.) The interaction Lagrangian for a spin 1 / 2 leptogluon is given by

[formula]

where Λ is the scale that determines the strength of the interaction. The decay width of the leptogluon into a muon and a gluon is given by

[formula]

The leptogluon can be produced in s-channel in a μp collider and the production cross section is given by

[formula]

where g(x,Q2) is the gluon luminosity.

R-parity Violating Squarks

R-parity is in general assumed in supersymmetry, but there is no theoretical reasons why R-parity should conserve. R-parity violation is included by introducing additional terms in the superpotential:

[formula]

where [formula] are superfields. The relevant term in the superpotential for the direct production of the R-parity violating squark at the μp collider is [formula]. The corresponding Lagrangian is

[formula]

where i,j,k are the family indices, and c denotes the charge conjugate. The R-parity violating squarks can be considered special scalar leptoquarks.

The cross section for μ+p  →  t̃L  →  μ+X is given by

[formula]

where d is the down-quark luminosity. The above formula can be easily changed to represent the production of other squarks with the corresponding subscripts in λ' and the parton luminosity. If kinematically allowed the leptoquarks, leptogluons, and the R-parity violating squarks are produced in s-channel and thus give rise to spectacular enhancement in a single bin of the invariant mass M distribution or the x distribution.

Contact Interactions

The effective four-fermion contact interactions can arise from fermion compositeness or exchanges of heavy particles like heavy Z', heavy leptoquarks, or other exotic particles. The conventional effective Lagrangian of llqq (l = e,μ) contact interactions has the form [\cite=me]

[formula]

where the eight independent coefficients ηluαβ and ηldαβ have dimension (TeV)- 2 and are conventionally expressed as ηlqαβ  =  εg2  /  Λ2lq, with a fixed g2 = 4π.

We introduce the reduced amplitudes Mμqαβ, where the subscripts label the chiralities of the initial lepton (α) and quark (β). The SM tree level reduced amplitude for μq  →  μq is

[formula]

where   =   - Q2 is the Mandelstam variable, gfL  =  T3f  -   sin 2θwQf and gfR  =    -   sin 2θwQf, T3f and Qf are, respectively, the third component of the SU(2) isospin and the electric charge of the fermion f in units of the proton charge, and e2 = 4παem. The new physics contributions to the reduced amplitudes Mαβ from the μμqq contact interactions of Eq. ([\ref=effL]) are

[formula]

The differential cross section are given by

[formula]

The above contact interactions do not enhance the cross section in a single bin of the invariant mass distribution like the light leptoquarks do, instead, contact interactions enhance the cross section at the large Q2 tail.

Sensitivity Reach

The 95% sensitivity of the contact interaction scale that can be reached by μp colliders at various center-of-mass energies and luminosities are performed in the following. We use the x-y distribution to investigate the sensitivity to the new contact interactions. We divide the x-y plane into a grid with 0.05 < x < 0.95 and 0.05 < y < 0.95 and 0.1 interval in both x and y directions. We calculate the number of events predicted by the standard model in each bin, call it nsmi. We use an overall efficiency of 0.8. We assume that the observed number of events is given by the standard model. We vary one ημqαβ at a time while keeping others zero and calculate the predicted number of events in each bin, call it nthi. We then calculate the χ2 using

[formula]

where the sum is over all 9  ×  9 bins. We know that for a larger η we will obtain a larger χ2, which means that it is really different from the standard model beyond statistical fluctuation. Here we have 80 degree of freedom, and so for a 95% CL we set χ2 = 102. We then repeat for another η.

The sensitivity reach of Λμqαβ is tabulated in Table [\ref=table2]. The sensitivity reach depends on the sign of the contact term. The maximum reach of Λ at each center-of-mass energy roughly scales as [formula]. The effect of luminosity on Λ is rather small: Λ only scales as the 1 / 4th power of the luminosity.

To estimate the sensitivity reach for R-parity violating squarks we start with λ'231 for the top squark and the down quark luminosity. We assume the enhancement in cross section is in the mass bin of 0.9  mt̃L  <  m  <  1.1  mt̃L. We calculate the number of events predicted by the standard model in this bin, call it nsm. Again, we use an overall efficiency of 0.8. Then we use the poisson statistics to estimate the nth that nsm can fluctuate to at the 95% CL:

[formula]

where nth is the first n that the above inequality is satisfied. Once the nth is obtained the λ'231 can be obtained using Eq. ([\ref=90]).

The sensitivity reach of λ231' is tabulated in Table  [\ref=table3]. We have also calculated the sensitivity reach of λ232' using the strange quark luminosity. We found that the reach is typically worse than that of λ231': for small mt̃L the reach is about a factor of two worse while for large mt̃L the reach can be ten times worse. This is because the strange quark luminosity is rather large at small x but very small at large x.

The results for the second generation leptoquarks and leptogluons are summarized in Table [\ref=table4] [\cite=new]. Here only a simple criteria is defined for the discovery of the leptoquarks and leptogluons. Assuming no background and requiring five signal events for the discovery the sensitivity reach is at 99% CL.
