We consider conditions necessary for a successful implementation of so-called assisted inflation. We generalize the applicability of assisted inflation beyond exponential potentials as originally proposed to include standard chaotic (λφ4 or m2φ2) models as well. We also demonstrate that in a purely 4-dimensional theory, unless the assisted sector is in fact decoupled, the additional fields of the assisted sector actually impede inflation. As a specific example of an assisted sector, we consider a 5-dimensional KK model for which the extra dimension may be somewhat or much larger than the inverse Planck scale. In this case, the assisted sector (coming from a KK compactification) eliminates the need for a fine-tuned quartic coupling to drive chaotic inflation. This is a general result of models with one or more "large" extra dimensions.

Introduction

One of the long standing problems in inflationary model building is the apparent necessity of some fine-tuned couplings or masses (see [\cite=reviews] for reviews). Barring an alternative to standard inflation, either a model predicting the presence of small couplings, or a more innovative model which does not require them must be constructed. Developments such as the pre-big bang model [\cite=pbb] go a long way towards this goal, but issues such as the graceful exit still require resolution [\cite=ge].

The simplest inflationary scenarios are by far the chaotic inflation models [\cite=chaotic] involving a single scalar field. For example, a potential of the form V(φ)  =  λφ4 will produce sufficient inflation if the initial background field value is φ  >   few MP. However, in order to obtain the correct magnitude for density fluctuations, one must require that the vacuum energy density during the last ~  50 e-foldings of inflation is of order V  ~  (1016  ~  GeV)4 or λ  ~  10- 12. Similarly chaotic models based on potentials of the form V(φ)  =  m2φ2, require m  ~  10- 5MP in order to satisfy the COBE constraint.

It is well known that power-law expansion [\cite=pl] rather than exponential expansion may be sufficient to resolve the standard cosmological problems associated with inflation and that such solutions can be generated by exponential potentials [\cite=pl] [\cite=exp]. For example, a potential of the form V(φ)  =  e-  λφ, leads to power law expansion with the cosmological scale factor growing as R(t)  ~  tp with p  =  2 / λ2. Furthermore, density fluctuations are no longer scale invariant but scale as [formula] with [formula]. To obtain, n≃1, one requires p to be large.

Recently, it was noticed [\cite=liddle] that a system of several scalar fields each with a potential

[formula]

could drive power law inflation with a net power [formula] sufficient to solve the cosmological problems, even if each of the fields φi alone are not capable of doing so. Furthermore, the spectral index of density fluctuations is also brought closer to the scale invariant spectrum if p is replaced by p̃. The dynamics of this type of "assisted" model was discussed in [\cite=mw].

Here, we will show that the assisted paradigm can easily be extended to other types of inflationary models such as the chaotic models mentioned above. We will also show that the ansatz ([\ref=dec]) of effectively decoupled scalar fields is absolutely necessary for assistance to work. For example, the case of N scalar fields each with a potential defined by pi  =  p, would lead to p̃  =  Np for self-coupled fields, while it would lead to p̃  =  p / N for a system of fields which were cross-coupled. Such a situation would undermine the benefits of assisted inflation.

Although the identity of these multiple fields was not specified in [\cite=liddle], one possible source for the necessary multiplicity is a theory with an extra compact dimension. The Kaluza-Klein reduction of a scalar field in 5 dimensions, will result in a spectrum of states with masses [formula] where L is the size of the compact extra dimension. If L  ≫  M- 1P, there may be many nearly massless "copies" of the original scalar field which may serve to assist inflation. We find that, although the resulting system of scalar fields produced from the KK reduction may be heavily cross-coupled, it can eliminate the usual fine-tuning associated with chaotic inflation driven by a quartic coupling and achieves the goals of assisted inflation.

Assisted inflation and decoupled fields

Assisted inflation as described in [\cite=liddle] [\cite=mw] relies on the premise that there exist a set of N scalar fields each with potential given by ([\ref=dec]). The Lagrangian for the system is given by

[formula]

Each field φi satisfies its equation of motion

[formula]

where the Hubble parameter is given by

[formula]

(We are working in units such that 8π / M2P  =  1.) In [\cite=liddle] [\cite=mw] it was shown that this system has a late-time attractor solution described by a single rescaled scalar field φ̃2  =  (p̃  /  p1)φ21 with potential ṽ  =  (p̃  /  p1)V1. The resulting power-law expansion of the Universe is simply R(t)  ~  tp̃ (provided that each of the pi  >  1 / 3).

As we will now demonstrate, the basic idea behind assisted inflation can be applied more generally than the case of exponential potentials. We can consider a general field theory of multiple, self-interacting scalar fields of the form

[formula]

The equation of motion for each field φi derived from the variation of the above Lagrangian has the form

[formula]

From the above equation, it is obvious that the system consists of N completely decoupled scalar fields or equivalently of N copies of the same field. As a result, the Lagrangian can be written as

[formula]

where

[formula]

Notice that the above field redefinition (made to rewrite the Lagrangian in terms of a field with a canonical kinetic term) results in a scalar field with an unchanged mass. The resulting theory describes a single scalar field with the same type of self-interactions compared to the fields in the original theory. However, these self-interactions are considerably weaker since both of the coupling constants now scale with the number of scalar fields N. As a result, as the number of scalar fields that we include in the theory becomes larger, the effective coupling constants naturally become smaller and the corresponding fine-tuning becomes milder. Thus the same basic idea expounded in [\cite=liddle] [\cite=mw] carries over very simply to chaotic inflation based on a quartic potential. While λ̃4 must still be of order 10- 12, the fundamental coupling in the theory λ4 can now be much larger if N is large. Note, however, that the additional scalar fields do not affect the quadratic version of chaotic inflation whatsoever.

General theories with cross couplings

The success of the assisted paradigm demonstrated in the section above, is directly related to the absence of cross-coupling terms between different scalar fields. As soon as the multiple self-interacting scalar fields are substituted with cross-coupled fields, the assistance method ceases to work. To see that this is the case, it is reasonable to consider general field theories of multiple scalar fields of the form

[formula]

where the potential may contain not only self-interaction terms, like the theory in section 2, but also cross-coupling terms between different fields. Specifically, we study the following three cases: (A) We start by considering the following simple theory of coupled scalar fields with cubic and quartic interaction terms:

[formula]

In this form, the invariance of the theory under the change φi  ↔  φj is obvious which leads to identical equations of motion for each of the different scalar fields

[formula]

By subtracting the equations of motion of two arbitrary fields φi and φj, we can easily see that the solution φi  =  φj is the unique late-time attractor of the system. As a result, the Lagrangian can be written as

[formula]

where

[formula]

We notice that, when we allow cross-coupling terms between different fields to be present in the theory, we obtain a result for the effective potential which is radically different from the one we found in the case of self-interacting fields in section 2. The presence of these cross-coupling terms drives the effective potential, or the coupling constants, in the opposite direction from that desired: the renormalized, single scalar field φ̃ is more strongly coupled than the original scalar fields φi with the coupling parameters, λ̃3 and λ̃4, increasing with the number of scalar fields that we include in the theory. As a result, the necessary fine-tuning of the coupling constants becomes now much more severe. (B) A slightly different version of the above coupled scalar field theory can be formulated in the following way. Consider,

[formula]

In the last two terms, the indices (i,j,k) and (i,j,k,l) are not allowed to all take on the same value and, as a result, these terms describe only cross-couplings between different fields. The above formulation, i.e. the introduction of the parameters c3 and c4 in the cubic and quartic interaction terms, respectively, allows us to turn off the cross-couplings between the scalar fields while keeping the self-interactions in the theory.

We can rewrite the above Lagrangian in the following way

[formula]

and, then, the equation of motion for each field φj has the form

[formula]

If we subtract the equations of motion of the fields φj and φk, we can easily conclude that, once again, the unique late-time attractor of the theory has all of the fields equal. By making use of this result, the Lagrangian may be written as

[formula]

where

[formula]

If we choose c3 = c4 = 0, then, we recover the theory of self-interacting scalar fields that was discussed in section 2 and for which the assistance effect worked perfectly leading to an extremely weakly coupled scalar field theory. If, on the other hand, we choose c3 = c4 = 1, then, we go back to the case (A) studied above, where the potential increases rapidly with the number N of scalar fields. A third possibility arises when the parameters ci adopt some intermediate values. For example, if, for large N, c3  ~  1 / N2 and c4  ~  1 / N3, the coefficients of the renormalized cubic and quartic terms that appear inside the brackets are of O(1) and the desired behavior ([\ref=good2]) of the coupling parameters λ̃i is ensured. One could argue that the result of this analysis is to transfer the fine-tuning from the coupling constants to the parameters ci. Indeed, it shows the degree to which the cross-couplings must be fine-tuned for assistance to work.

(C) Finally, we consider a theory of N scalar fields coupled to each other through an exponential potential

[formula]

This is similar to the potential considered by Liddle et al. [\cite=liddle] with the sum of exponentials replaced by a product. In the case of the summation, the N scalar fields do not interact with each other and the unique late-time attractor has all fields equal. As discussed in the introduction, this solution leads to a power law expansion which can solve the standard inflationary problems with a relatively flat spectrum of density fluctuations.

In our case, however, the scalar fields are coupled to each other. The equation of motion for the field φi takes the form

[formula]

The right-hand-side of the above equation is the same for every field φi. As a result, the unique late-time attractor, which has all the fields equal, is still valid even in this case where the fields are coupled. Now, the Lagrangian can be written as

[formula]

where now

[formula]

As a result, if p, in the original theory, was not large enough to support inflation, the situation is worsened since p is divided by the number of scalar fields that are present in the theory.

In each of the cases studied above, it is evident that the presence of interaction terms between the scalar fields of the theory undermines the benefits of assistance and impedes the successful implementation of inflation. While the cases we studied are certainly simplified, we expect the general result to hold, namely, in a theory with multiple scalar fields, assistance requires the absence (or near absence) of cross-couplings between the scalar fields.

Field theories with multiple scalar fields

Given the potential utility of having several or many fields which are in some sense copies of each other, we now look at a possible source for these fields in theories with extra spatial dimensions. It is well known that the Kaluza-Klein reduction of a theory leads to the existence of many new fields which appear as zero-modes in the final 4-dimensional theory. For example, consider a simple 5-dimensional gravitational action of the form

[formula]

where M5 is the five-dimensional Planck mass. Upon compactification along dimension of circumference 2L, we obtain

[formula]

where M2P  =  2LM35, γ is the scalar associated with the 5-5 component of the metric (e2γ  =  g55), and FKK is the field strength of the Kaluza-Klein gauge field associated with [formula]. This action can be brought into the Einstein frame by the conformal transformation G4μν  =  e-  γgμν to give

[formula]

Let us further suppose that the original 5-dimensional theory contains an additional massless scalar field [formula] with action

[formula]

where the indices A,B  =  {t,x1,x2,x3,z}. We can Fourier expand [formula] along z as

[formula]

where 0 is the 5-dimensional field that depends only on non-compact coordinates.

Upon reducing to 4 dimensions, and performing the same conformal transformation, the action ([\ref=actphi5]) becomes

[formula]

where we have defined the 4-dimensional scalar field [formula]. In what follows, we will assume that the dilaton-like field γ is fixed [\cite=ac], and ignore the role of the KK gauge field Aμ. Although we have written the action in terms of an infinite sum, the momentum along z, pz, should be limited by M5. In that case, we should only consider fields up to [formula]. For (πL- 1  ≪  M5), there may be many fields which can in principle assist inflation. Such theories are, to say the least, of wide interest at the moment [\cite=large] (see also [\cite=nem] and references therein).

Let us now consider the following 5-dimensional scalar field, self-interacting through a quartic potential, as a concrete example:

[formula]

The kinetic term for the 5-dimensional field [formula] can be expanded as in ([\ref=actphi4]). Similarly, the substitution of the expansion ([\ref=expansion]) in the potential gives rise to numerous interaction terms between the Kaluza-Klein scalar fields. Then, the 4-dimensional Lagrangian can be written as

[formula]

in terms of the 4-dimensional field φ and the 4-dimensional coupling λ  =  λ̂ / (2LM5). Note that in the last term in the last equation we include only the terms for which n + k - l  ≥  1. It is also important to note that the 4-dimensional (dimensionless) coupling is now reduced relative to the original 5-dimensional coupling λ̂ by an amount 2LM5≃N.

It will be useful to begin the analysis of this system by first simplifying to a restricted set of fields. Thus, in the lowest order approximation, we may assume that, apart from the field φ0, only φ1 and φ*1 are present in the theory and set all the other Kaluza-Klein fields equal to zero. By making use of the definitions

[formula]

the effective Lagrangian takes the form

[formula]

The variation of this Lagrangian with respect to φ0, X and Y leads to the following equations of motion

[formula]

Obviously, the latter two equations are the same, and so we can set

[formula]

Making this substitution for Y, the first two equations of motion reduce to

[formula]

As long as the mass term is negligible compared to the cubic term, i.e. when m2 <  < λ  φ20 / 2,

[formula]

is also a solution, provided that

[formula]

In this case, the kinetic part of the Lagrangian can be written as

[formula]

and by using the constraint ([\ref=cona1]), we obtain

[formula]

where we have implemented the field redefinition

[formula]

in order to map the system of the three real, scalar fields to a theory of a single scalar field. Next, we look at the quartic potential which now takes the form

[formula]

where ṽ is the quartic potential of the renormalized scalar field φ̃. As a result, the presence of the two Kaluza-Klein fields X and Y have raised the value of the effective potential by a factor of 15 / 7 and so, the fine tuning of the coupling constant λ has worsened. Note that this result does not depend on the substitution ([\ref=assum1]) and holds even if we set Y = 0.

Before we tackle the more general case, it will still be useful to consider the next-to-lowest order where we allow φ2 and φ*2, apart from φ0, φ1 and φ*1, to be present in the theory. In a similar way, we set

[formula]

and define

[formula]

Once again the system can be simplified. In this case, the choice X2 = 0 corresponds to a special solution of the five field system as long as X21 = Y21. Then, the remaining equations of motion are given by

[formula]

If we further assume, as before, that the masses m21 and m22 are small compared to λφ2 / 2 and neglect them, the ansatz

[formula]

is indeed a solution of the system ([\ref=a])-([\ref=c]). Rearranging equations ([\ref=a])-([\ref=b]) and ([\ref=b])-([\ref=c]), we obtain the constraints

[formula]

respectively. The above system of algebraic equations can be solved numerically leading to the following pairs of values for the proportionality coefficients q and p

[formula]

The above set of solutions are supplemented by another set where the signs of q and p are opposite. But, as we will see, both the potential and the kinetic terms are invariant under the simultaneous change q  →   - q and p  →   - p and so, we may ignore the second set of solutions.

By setting X2 = 0 and using the proportionality relations that hold between the remaining four scalar fields, the kinetic Lagrangian takes the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

In the same way, the effective potential can be written as

[formula]

Substituting the values of the parameters q and p from solutions ([\ref=A])-([\ref=D]), we obtain the final results for the value of the effective potential

[formula]

where the renormalization of the scalar field ([\ref=renorm]) has been taken into account. According to the above results, there is one solution that multiplies the one-field-potential ṽ by a numerical coefficient 3.48, which can be compared to the lowest order solution where the potential was multiplied by 15 / 7≃ 2.14. In this case the fine-tuning is further aggravated. However, there are three additional solutions that multiply the potential by coefficients which, although larger than unity, are smaller than the first one. Thus, there is the hope that as we add more and more extra fields these coefficients become smaller. Recall, that our goal is to ease the original fine-tuning problem associated with (in this case) a simple λφ4 chaotic inflationary model. Furthermore, for N  ~  2LM5  ≫  1, the 4-dimensional coupling is λ  ~  λ̂ / N and will be small provided, λ̂  ~  1 and [formula] or equivalently, [formula]. Therefore, so long as the potential does not grow as N, there will be a viable solution for the assisted paradigm.

One could argue that the above results for the effective potential hold only for the special solution ([\ref=spec]) supplemented by the relations X2 = 0 and X21 = Y21 that we have considered. For this reason, we studied some additional special solutions of the equations of motion, namely

[formula]

Under a numerical renormalization of the proportionality coefficients, i.e.

[formula]

the above solutions, substituted in the equations of motion, lead to the same constraints ([\ref=conb1])-([\ref=conb2]) for the coefficients [formula] and p̃ and the same results ([\ref=res1])-([\ref=res4]) for the effective potential. As in the lowest order, the effective potential seems to depend merely on the number of the real scalar fields included in the theory and not on their "flavor", i.e. if they come from the real or imaginary parts of the complex Kaluza-Klein fields or from an arbitrary combination of them.

Indeed, the invariance of the effective potential under the selection of different special solutions exists, as long as these solutions are characterized by the same number of real fields and lead to the same number of constraints on the proportionality coefficients involved. As we mentioned above, the result is always independent of the origin of these real fields. We may, then, conclude, that the real and imaginary parts of N Kaluza-Klein complex fields, that come from the compactification of the fifth dimension, constitute equivalent degrees of freedom contributing equally to the final number of 2N degrees of freedom. This result allows us to substitute the N complex Kaluza-Klein fields with 2N real fields. Then, the Lagrangian ([\ref=lagrangian]) reduces to

[formula]

with equations of motion given by

[formula]

It is to be understood that the fields denoted by index combinations such as n + k + l and n + k - l are to be included only if they are ≥  1 and ≤  2N.

Although the substitution of complex fields by an equivalent number of real fields simplifies the theory, it does not allow us to study the effect from the addition of a large number of extra scalar fields on the effective potential by using the method described above. The appearance of new cross-coupling terms as we increase the order of the theory makes the analytical formulation of the problem extremely tedious and the determination of the result for the effective potential impossible even through numerical methods.

As an alternative approach to the problem, we construct the function φn + 1  -  φn out of the difference of two consecutive Kaluza-Klein fields and it is easy to show that it satisfies the following equation

[formula]

The right-hand-side of the above equation, which is proportional to the first derivative of the effective potential with respect to the field φn + 1  -  φn, has a minimum when φn approaches both φn - 1 and φn + 1 at late times. As a result, one of the possible late-time attractors of the theory has all of the extra fields equal. By setting φ1  =  φ2 = ... = φ2N, the calculation of the effective potential in the presence of 2N extra scalar fields in the theory can be easily conducted.

However, the above argument suffers from two major loopholes: first, the attractor that has all of the Kaluza-Klein fields equal is only one of the possible late-time attractors and may be not the one chosen by the system and, second, the condition φn - 1  =  φn  =  φn + 1 can not be fulfilled for the "boundary fields" φ1 and φ2N. In the case n = 1, the field φn - 1 does not exist by construction and the same holds for φn + 1 when n = 2N. Both of the above problems can be eliminated by imposing the periodic condition φ2N + i  =  φi when 2N real Kaluza-Klein fields are present in the theory. Then, the "boundaries" are removed and we can define both φn - 1 and φn + 1 for every field φn. Moreover, we may prove that, after the imposition of the periodic condition, the attractor that has all of the fields equal is the unique late-time attractor of the system. For this purpose, we are going to make use of the induction method. We start with the case with 2 real Kaluza-Klein fields for which the Lagrangian ([\ref=lagr2]) becomes

[formula]

Note that, strictly speaking, the above Lagrangian should follow from eq. ([\ref=lagrangian]) in the next-to-lowest order considered above if we put Y1 = Y2 = 0. However, this is not exactly the case: due to the boundary condition imposed, there are additional terms present in the Lagrangian which modify the coefficients of the cross-coupling terms while leaving their structure unchanged. The equations of motion of the fields φ1 and φ2, then, have the form

[formula]

Subtracting the above equations, we obtain the result

[formula]

The right-hand-side of the above equation is the first derivative of the effective potential with respect to the field ψ  =  φ2  -  φ1. It is obvious that the choice ψ = 0 minimizes the potential. Actually, this is the only minimum of the potential since the expression inside the brackets does not have any real solutions.

Next, we assume that the only minimum of the effective potential, when 2N - 1 scalar fields are included in the theory, corresponds to φ1  =  φ2 = ... = φ2N - 1. We will show that if we add one more field, φ2N, the aforementioned late-time attractor expands in order to include φ2N, too. So, assuming that we have 2N - 1 equal scalar fields and the field φ2N, the Lagrangian ([\ref=lagr2]) takes the form

[formula]

Now, the equations of motion of the fields φ1 and φ2N take the form

[formula]

while the equation of motion of the field ψ  =  φ2N  -  φ1 is found to be

[formula]

The above equation is identical with eq. ([\ref=n2]) and, as a result, the effective potential has a unique minimum at ψ = 0. According to the above result, the only late-time attractor for the system of 2N Kaluza-Klein scalar fields corresponds to φ1  =  φ2 = ... = φ2N - 1  =  φ2N.

Now, we proceed to calculate the kinetic term and the effective potential of the system. By using the late-time attractor of equal fields in the case of 2N scalar fields, the kinetic part of the Lagrangian ([\ref=lagr2]) takes the form

[formula]

where we have assumed the proportionality relation φ0 = q  φ1 and renormalized the scalar field φ0. Then, the effective potential reduces to

[formula]

where ṽ is the quartic potential of the renormalized field φ̃. According to the above result, the effective potential depends on two parameters: the number N of Kaluza-Klein fields that we include in the theory and the proportionality coefficient q. This coefficient, although a number, may itself depend on N changing radically the picture for the behavior of the effective potential. So, in order to draw consistent conclusions, we reconsider the equations of motion of the fields φ0 and φ1,

[formula]

By making use of the relation φ0 = q  φ1 and rearranging accordingly the above equations, we obtain the following constraint for the proportionality coefficient

[formula]

This algebraic equation has the solutions

[formula]

When each one of the above values is substituted in the expression ([\ref=vfinal]), the potential exhibits a different behavior. Analytically: (i) q = q1. In this case, we obtain:

[formula]

For N = 2, this gives [formula]. However, in the limit N  →    ∞  , the effective potential asymptotically tends to ṽ. Note that the imposition of the periodic boundary condition demands the existence of two boundaries so N  ≥  2. When, at the next-to-lowest order, we studied the case N = 2, we did not obtain any solution with the coefficient that multiplies ṽ being smaller that unity. This means that the above solution owes its existence to the imposition of the periodic condition on the Kaluza-Klein fields (for N  =  2) and it may not constitute a generic solution of the original theory. However, for large N, we expect this behavior to approximate the solution of the original Lagrangian. In particular, this is exactly the type of solution we were searching for. Namely, at large N, the potential of the late-time attractor fields does not depend on N relative to the original 4-dimensional potential. Therefore, for large N, chaotic inflation is realized in 4-dimensions with a quartic 5-dimensional coupling λ̂  ~  1, and we have an explicit example of assisted inflation. (ii) q = q2. Then, we have:

[formula]

Then,

[formula]

which clearly shows that the potential tends to increase with the number of scalar fields that we include in the theory. The above solution corresponds to the results ([\ref=veffn=1]) and ([\ref=veffn=2]) derived in the lowest (N = 1) and next-to-lowest order (N = 2), respectively. Both these solutions showed a tendency to increase with the number of Kaluza-Klein fields, a behavior which obviously survived after the imposition of the periodic condition. Of course this solution has exactly the N-dependence that prohibits an assisted solution. (iii) q = q3. In this case:

[formula]

Now,

[formula]

In this case, the largest value that the potential takes on corresponds to N = 2 and, as we add more and more scalar fields, it asymptotically tends to ṽ with the multiplication coefficient being always larger than unity. This solution is the analog of the solutions ([\ref=res1]), ([\ref=res3]) and ([\ref=res4]) derived in the next-to-lowest order approximation. By making use of the periodic condition, we managed to include a large number of scalar fields in our model and found that these coefficients decrease with the number of fields, as we expected. As in the case with q  =  q1, this class of solutions also allows for chaotic inflation with λ̂  ~  1 through assistance.

Although the large number of fields has managed to remove the fine-tuning problems, it is necessary to verify that the initial conditions for inflation to occur are indeed fulfilled. In four dimensions, we normally assume ṽ(φ̃)  ~  M4P, which for λ  ≪  1, corresponds to φ̃  ≫  MP. If these conditions are translated into our five dimensional quantities, then we would find,   ~  M1 / 2PM5 and V̂  ~  M2PM35  ≫  M55. Without a better understanding of the dynamics of the 5-dimensional theory, we should instead insist that V̂()  ~  M55. This condition, then, becomes

[formula]

since N = 2LM5 = M2P / M25  ≫  1. The requirement that the 4-dimensional coupling constant should be of O(10- 12) imposes the following condition on the 5-dimensional coupling and the four- and five-dimensional Planck mass

[formula]

By appropriately choosing the values of the above quantities, the required value of λ is naturally obtained. However, the initial condition for inflation φ̃  ≥  MP puts a constraint on the smallest possible value of the ratio M5 / MP : when the above condition is combined with the expression ([\ref=infl1]) for the 4-dimensional potential, one finds M5  ≥  10- 6MP. Then, even if λ̂ is as large as of O(1), we can still obtain λ  ~  10- 12. The problems encountered when M5  ≪  MP have recently been discussed [\cite=ly] [\cite=kl]. However, for M5  ~  10- 3MP as in many models of string unification [\cite=m], we would have N  ~  106, and an initial value of λ̂  ~  10- 6 would be brought down to the correct four dimensional coupling.

There is one more issue which must be addressed. In this section, we have discussed the conditions leading to inflation, and the attractor solution of the equations of motion. In doing so, we have neglected the KK mass terms, which is valid so long as m2  <  λφ20. At the onset of inflation, this condition is obeyed by all of the KK fields only if the maximum mass we are considering (which corresponds to the Nth state and has mass ~  M5) satisfies M25  <  λφ20  ~  λ1 / 2MPM5, or [formula]. This means that only for the marginal value of M5≃10- 6MP all of the KK fields can be considered effectively massless while for M5≃10- 3MP we can ignore the masses only for those fields with m2  <  10- 3M25. Moreover, as the field φ̃ moves toward the minimum of the potential, φ0 becomes smaller as well and, gradually, more and more fields cease to satisfy our assumption on the masses of the fields φi. The equations of motion of these massive fields are dominated by their mass terms with the only late-time attractor being the trivial one. As a result, these fields get decoupled from the rest of the system with a time-scale inversely proportional to their mass: the more massive they are, the faster they decouple. At the end of the day, when φ̃ finally reaches the minimum of the potential, all of the massive KK fields have decoupled and only the massless (by construction) KK zero-mode, φ0, has remained playing the role of the inflaton φ̃. However, this behavior does not affect the resolution of the fine-tuning problem in the least. As the number of KK fields, that can be considered massless, decreases, the solution q = q1 gradually disappears while the other two solutions, q = q2 and q = q3, tend to become identical resulting in an effective potential which is again independent of the number N. As a result, the resolution of the fine-tuning problem holds at all times: from the onset of inflation, when all or part of the KK fields can be considered massless and contribute to the inflaton, until its final stages, when all the KK fields have decoupled.

It appears that the compactification of a large extra dimension can lead to assistance effects enhancing the probabilities for inflation not only in the case of power-law potentials but in the case of exponential potentials as well. As an illuminating example, we consider the following 5-dimensional scalar field theory

[formula]

where V̂0 and p̂ are constants. As in the case of the quartic potential, the 5-dimensional field [formula] (which is perhaps a modulus field from the compactification of additional dimensions in the theory) can be Fourier expanded along the compact coordinate z. When the expansion ([\ref=expansion]) is substituted in the above Lagrangian, we obtain a scalar field theory described by eq. ([\ref=trans]), interacting, through an exponential potential. Even in terms of 5-dimensional quantities, this theory is ladened with interactions since the potential of every field multiplies the potential of every other field. When the integration over the compact coordinate is conducted, we expect an effective, heavily interacting, 4-dimensional scalar theory to arise. However, the form of the potential makes the integration over z extremely difficult. Nevertheless, we can still make some qualitative arguments on the assistance effect that follows from compactification. In terms of 4-dimensional quantities, the above Lagrangian can be written as

[formula]

As it is well known, a 4-dimensional theory of the form given above leads to a power-law expansion of the Universe: R(t)  ~  tp̃. After compactification, the parameter p̂ has been multiplied by the number of massive KK fields that are present in the theory and, as a result, for sufficiently large N, the 4-dimensional theory will produce inflation even if the 5-dimensional theory with the parameter p̂ was not able to. Finally, it is worth noting that the above dependence of the field φ̃ and the parameters ṽ0 and p̃ on the number of multiple fields N was also derived in [\cite=liddle] although the origin of the fields was not specified. Here, we argue that the compactification of a 5-dimensional theory with an exponential potential could provide us with both the necessary multiplicity of scalar fields and the desired dependence of the parameters of the theory on the number of fields.

We summarize the results of this section: The Kaluza-Klein compactification of the fifth dimension of a 5-dimensional theory of a single, self-interacting scalar field leads to the appearance of a large number of Kaluza-Klein scalar fields in the 4-dimensional effective theory. A feature of this effective theory is the presence of a complicated web of interaction terms between the scalar fields of the theory. Once the late-time attractor of the system is determined, this field theory of multiple scalar fields can be mapped to a theory of a single, self-interacting scalar field φ̃. The presence of the interaction terms drives the effective potential towards two different directions: in one case, it increases with the number of extra scalar fields that are present in the theory while, in the second case, is starts with a value slightly smaller or larger than the value of the one-field-self-interaction potential ṽ but asymptotically tends back to ṽ. At the end of the analysis, the renormalized scalar field φ̃ turns out to be much more (q  =  q2) or equally strongly coupled (q  =  q1,3) compared to the initial 4-dimensional Kaluza-Klein fields. As a result, the renormalized coupling λ̃, defined as λ multiplied by the expressions in brackets in eqs. ([\ref=veff1]), ([\ref=veff2]) and ([\ref=veff3]), takes on a value which is much larger (q  =  q2) or almost the same (q  =  q1,3) compared to the value of the initial 4-dimensional coupling λ. However, in the latter cases, λ̃ is suppressed by the number of scalar fields relative to the original coupling λ̂ of the 5-dimensional scalar field. This a concrete example of assisted inflation.

Conclusions

In this paper, we have dealt with the problem of fine-tuned coupling constants in the framework of field theories that involve self-coupled or interacting scalar fields. This problem inevitably arises when we consider the possibility of the creation of an inflationary epoch in our universe and demand an agreement between the theoretical predictions and the experimental (COBE) data on density fluctuations.

We have demonstrated by considering some general field theories of multiple scalar fields in 4 dimensions that the idea of assisted inflation based on exponential potentials [\cite=liddle] can be easily extended in the case of power-law potentials. In this case, the presence of multiple scalar fields leads to a renormalized theory of a single scalar field which is considerably less strongly coupled than the original fields of the theory. The renormalized coupling constants scale with the number of fields N which permits the creation of an inflationary period without severe fine-tuning. However, the effectiveness of assistance depends strongly on the interactions between the scalar fields of the theory. If the multiple scalar fields are assumed to be only self-coupled, both power-law inflation based on exponential potentials as well as chaotic inflation works well with only mild or no fine-tuning at all depending on the number of fields N that we include in the theory. If, on the other hand, we allow cross-coupling terms between different scalar fields, the assistance method breaks down leading to a much more strongly coupled theory.

As a concrete example of a field theory with multiple scalar fields, we considered a single, self-interacting scalar field living in 5 dimensions with a quartic potential. (Other recent constructions for inflationary models involving a large extra dimension can be found in refs. [\cite=nem] [\cite=ly] [\cite=kl] [\cite=ikko] [\cite=ekoy] [\cite=ov].) Assuming that the fifth dimension is compactified along a circle and applying a Kaluza-Klein reduction of the 5-dimensional field, we obtained a 4-dimensional, effective theory with the necessary multiplicity of scalar fields fulfilled by the presence of the Kaluza-Klein modes. The resulting potential contains a complex network of cross-coupling terms. As suggested by our previous results, these interaction terms are expended to hinder inflation. In terms of 4-dimensional quantities, this is indeed the case. Once the theory of multiple Kaluza-Klein fields is mapped to a theory of a single, renormalized scalar field, we found three different solutions for the corresponding effective potential: the first one follows a behavior similar to the one derived in the purely 4-dimensional case and drives the potential, and thus the renormalized coupling constant, to large values increasing with the number of scalar fields; the other two solutions start with a value for the effective potential which is slightly smaller or larger than the value of the one-field-potential ṽ but asymptotically tends to ṽ as we increase the number of fields. In both cases, the desired behavior of the effective potential is not achieved and the renormalized scalar field is either more or equally strongly coupled than the original 4-dimensional Kaluza-Klein fields. Consequently, the necessary fine-tuning of the renormalized quartic coupling constant λ̃ becomes more severe or at best remains the same compared to that of λ, a result which is attributed to the presence of interaction terms between the Kaluza-Klein fields of the theory. However, the theory of the renormalized, scalar field does indeed get assisted although via a different path. The 4-dimensional coupling constant λ of the Kaluza-Klein fields is determined by the 5-dimensional one, λ̂, divided by the number of the Kaluza-Klein modes. As a result, λ and thus λ̃, in the case of the latter two solutions, is suppressed by the number of scalar fields that are present in the theory relative to the original coupling constant λ̂ of the 5-dimensional theory. By choosing appropriate values of the five-dimensional Planck mass M5 and the five-dimensional coupling constant λ̂, we are able to naturally obtain a four-dimensional, self-interacted scalar theory with λ  ~  O(10- 12) (in agreement with COBE data) without the need of any fine-tuning. Moreover, our results do not depend on the number of massive KK fields that contribute to the inflaton field and, as a result, the resolution of the fine-tuning problem holds from the onset of inflation until its final stages.
