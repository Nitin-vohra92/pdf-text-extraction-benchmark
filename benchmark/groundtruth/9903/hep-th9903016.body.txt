ON PATH DEPENDENT STATE SPACE FOR THE PROCA FIELD ROLANDO GAITAN Grupo de Física Teórica, Departamento de Física, Facultad de Ciencias y Tecnología, Universidad de Carabobo, Valencia, Venezuela

In the reference [\cite=CGL] authors have presented the Proca gauge theory in a "Geometric" form. They use an open path representation [\cite=CGL] [\cite=FG] [\cite=GL] (P-representation) in wich the general quantum states and operators depend and act on path functionals, respectively. In this letter, as a contribution to the understanding of this formulation we discuss the explicit construction of the open path state space for Proca gauge theory as a geometrical extension from standard Quantum Field Theory. The letter is organized as follow. We present a self contained brief review on Proca gauge Theory in a Geometric Representation [\cite=CGL]. Then, the vacuum state is presented and, from its formal normalization the funtional integration measure is deduced. Finally, a recurrence relation for the excited states is given , showing as an example the first excited state and its energy.

The brief review begins here. Let L be the Lagrangian for the Proca gauge theory

[formula]

where the symbol [formula] means [formula], [formula] is the Maxwell field and ω is an scalar field (i.e., Stückelberg Scalar). Eq. [\eqref=eq1] is gauge invariant under the transformations [formula] and δω =  - Λ. Subsequently, form Dirac's quatization, First Class primary and secondary constraints arise; namely [formula] and [formula], where the π's are the canonical conjugates momenta of Proca and scalar fields, respectively. The Hamiltonian can then be obtained in the standard way

[formula]

The quantization of the theory starts with the promotion from fields to operators acting on the Hilbert space physical sector in the P-representation [formula] and the Poisson algebra to a commutator one. The sector [formula] is defined trough P-functionals prescribing Ψ(P.Q) = f(P)Ψ(Q) (here P and Q are open path colections) where

[formula]

is the gauge invariant "Wilson Path" (following the "Wilson Loop" idea) operator asociated to the 3-spatial path [formula], wich starts at x and ends at y.

The operator [\eqref=eq3] guarantees that [formula] contitutes a P-functional set of solutions of the First Class Constraints. At the same time Ψ(P) are eigenfunctions of [formula] and [formula] operator with eigenvalues ρ(z,P) and [formula], respectively. Let us recall the "end densities"

[formula]

and the distributional field of tangent vectors associated to the paths

[formula]

Next, when Mandelstam [\cite=M] and Loop [\cite=DNGT] derivatives are taken into account, the Hamiltonian [\eqref=eq2] can be rewritten in a geometric form

[formula]

Let us remember that given a P-functional G(P) the Mandelstam derivative can be defined as

[formula]

where δP is an infinitesimal open path. On the other hand the Loop derivative is

[formula]

where δC is an infinitesimal Loop with area [formula]. This ends the review.

In order to find the explicit form of the state space one can introduce the vacuum state as follows. The operator ([\ref=eq5]) has a cuadratic tangent-dependient interaction part and also end densities dependence. On the other hand, the kinematic term is a Laplacian-like. Then, the key to find the Schröedinger eigenstates consists in carrying out a narrow analogy with the standard quantum mechanic harmonic oscillator. For this system, the ground state should have a Gaussian functional form

[formula]

Demanding S(P) to be an even P-functional, a more general possible form is

[formula]

where the propagator [formula] is an explicit invariant under path translations and satisfies the following properties

[formula]

Considering [formula] the ground state energy eigenvalue, then the equation [formula] gives the following relations

[formula]

and

[formula]

where the propagator and energy are formally manipulated. Anyway equations ([\ref=eq11]) y ([\ref=eq12]) gives the formal solution for the vacuum state. To obtain this solution we transform to the Fourier Space, defining the transformed propagator [formula] by means of

[formula]

Substitution of eq. ([\ref=eq13]) in ([\ref=eq11]) leads to

[formula]

Here, the [formula] have some symetry properties coming from the original propagator; namely [formula] and [formula]. Taking this into account, we choose the ansatz

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are even real functions of momentum p. These functions can be easily obtained if one substitutes eq. ([\ref=eq15]) in ([\ref=eq14]). This gives the following double solutions for a and b

[formula]

with [formula]. However, if we require the Gaussian form for the ground state, only the particular choice [formula] and [formula] solutions is allowed. Considering this combination, from ([\ref=eq12]) the vacuum state energy is obtained

[formula]

It is noted that the [formula] factor, representing the three Proca field degrees of freedom is recovered, as well as the Klein-Gordon dispersion relation too. For this solution, the functional S(P) yields

[formula]

from this , the vacuum state is defined up to a conventional regularization factor (i.e., cut-off, etc).

Additionally, eq. [\eqref=eq18] throws light on the question of P-functional space integration measure. This question is fundamental if one wants to define an internal product in the state space. If we consider the polarizations vector [formula] (λ runs from 1 to 3 and labels the polarization states) whose completeness relations are

[formula]

with the Minkowski metric signature η = diag( +  -  -  - ), one can define a functional on 3-spatial paths and momentum space points

[formula]

where by eq. [\eqref=eq18] can be rewritten as

[formula]

It is easy to see that [formula] is proportional to the tangent [formula] fourier transformed, and that first one have complete information on paths in the same way that the tangent have it.

Then, we define the integration measure by means of the symbol

[formula]

and using eqs. [\eqref=eq8], [\eqref=eq21] and [\eqref=eq22] it is verified that the ground state is formally normalized

[formula]

In an identical way with the Loop Representation for the Maxwell Field [\cite=DNGT], we can observe the protagonical role played by the polarization vectors in the measure construction.

Let us finally show the recurrence relations for excited energy eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian [\eqref=eq5]. Following the analogy with the quantum mechanical harmonic oscilator we have the general solution

[formula]

where h(P) are P-functional polynomials of the form

[formula]

These are the functional extension of the Hermite's polynomials, and we demand the following properties: [formula] and [formula] bounded. In eq. [\eqref=eq25], the "propagators" [formula] satisfy the additional symetry property

[formula]

In this way , using eqs. [\eqref=eq9], [\eqref=eq24] and [\eqref=eq25] in HΨ(P) = EΨ(P) we obtain the desired recurrence relations for [formula]

[formula]

with [formula]. Eq. [\eqref=eq27] constitute a P-functional generalization of the recurrence relations that generate different Hermite's polynomials, linking the order s + 2 functions with those of order s. In this sense, the first excited state (meson state) in the Open Path Representation depends on the first Hermite's P-functional polynomial, that is to say

[formula]

Using the recurrence relations [\eqref=eq27] with [formula] bounded, the energy of this state is [formula].

Equation [\eqref=eq28] occurs in an identical way when the creation operator, constructed from the standard plane wave expansion acts on the vacuum state (i.e., see something similar in a functional formulation for scalar fields in [\cite=J]). However, it would be interesting to explore a posible construction of creation-anihilation operators in a pure geometrical language considering [formula] as a canonical variable (which has the whole information about the paths), and definig some P-functional derivative on this variable that acts on wave functions. The construction of this particular derivative perhaps needs the definition of a "P-functional Dirac delta" which compares two arbitrary paths and vanishes if these have no intersections.

I want to thank Professors L. Leal (Universidad Central de Venezuela) and C. Di Bartolo (Universidad Simón Bolivar) for many and fruitful discussions.
