Introduction

New one-dimensional integrable lattice models were introduced in [\cite=amp], within the framework of the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method [\cite=qism1] [\cite=qism2] [\cite=qism3]. They correspond to a generalization whereby every state of the original model, for the defining representation of the Lie algebra Am - 1 (see for instance [\cite=jimbo]), is replaced by an arbitrary number of copies. The structure of the R-matrices is left unchanged by the replacement, but a usual property, crossing unitarity, is lost. It is however still possible to construct integrable open boundary conditions. The eigenvalue set of the transfer matrix is unchanged, while the degeneracies increase [\cite=danzi]. For integrable periodic boundary conditions the eigenvalues and degeneracies change [\cite=amp].

These models are of interest in some one-dimensional reaction-diffusion processes [\cite=adhr]. (Similar but different models were also considered in [\cite=alcabar] as generalizations of the t-J model.) They also appear in connection with the Hubbard model for electrons, as a specific limit [\cite=aars] [\cite=hakobian] or, for m = 2 and at a certain value of the quantum parameter, as building blocks for the natural generalizations of the Hubbard model [\cite=ff] [\cite=piezi]. Upon fermionization, the multiple-states appear as different flavors of fermions. The general Hubbard models can then be seen as multichannel versions of the original model.

All the 'multiplicity' Am - 1 models of [\cite=amp] correspond to the defining representations of the Lie algebras Am - 1. As no quantum group formalism [\cite=jimbo] is yet known for the multiplicity models, it is not clear whether generalizations to higher dimensional representations are possible. There is no obvious or systematic way to do a replacement of states by multiple copies in higher dimensional R-matrices. The fusion method, known to work for ordinary models, turns out to give the correct answer for the multistate models.

The main result of this work is to show that such generalizations exist. I first review the fusion method for obtaining higher dimensional solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation starting from an arbitrary solution. The results of section [\ref=fusionsec] are quite general and require only a minimal number of assumptions. This method is then shown to work for the models at hand. This yields multiplicity models corresponding to some higher dimensional representations, and also shows that iterated fusions are possible. Thus all higher dimensional representations of sl(m) have multistate generalizations. Hamiltonians are obtained as the derivative of the new [formula]-matrices. I consider in detail the spin-0 and spin-1 models of sl(2), and give explicit expressions for their R-matrices.

Fusion

The multiple fusion procedure for sl(m) R-matrices was developed in [\cite=krs]. The idea for other algebras is the same [\cite=kr] [\cite=kns]. A simple description was given in [\cite=mene] for two successive fusions. Here I review the fusion method and give some additional general results.

The models are defined through their R-matrices. These are solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE):

[formula]

Here and below, the notation Oij ([formula]) means that the operator O acts non-trivially on the ith and jth spaces, and as the identity on the other spaces: [formula] (if i < j), where [formula]. Note also that the three spaces 1, 2 and 3 need not be copies of the same space.

Consider any solution R of the Yang-Baxter equation ([\ref=ybe]), which becomes proportional to a projector at some special value ρ of the spectral parameter. Define the projector π(1) so that [formula], and let [formula] be the orthogonal complementary projector. Setting λ  -  μ  =  ρ in the YBE one obtains:

[formula]

Left and right multiplication of ([\ref=ybep]) by π(2)12 yields two equations

[formula]

Define two fused matrices by

[formula]

Using equations ([\ref=ybep1],[\ref=ybep2]) and the YBE one shows that the matrices ([\ref=fus1]-[\ref=fus2]) satisfy a YBE where one space is a tensor product of two spaces:

[formula]

Thus starting with a given solution of the YBE, we have obtained higher-dimensional R-matrices which are also solutions of the YBE. If di,i = 1,2,3 are the dimensions of the spaces 1, 2 and 3, then R(i)< 12 > 3(λ) is a d1  ×  d2  ×  d3 dimensional square matrix. However the projection operators can be diagonalized simultaneously with a change of basis matrix S. S- 112R(i)< 12 > 3(λ)  S12 also satisfy equation ([\ref=ybefus1]), and their matrix expressions now contain a number of rows and columns with only vanishing elements, and which can be deleted without spoiling the Yang-Baxter property. The remaining rows and columns can eventually be relabeled according to the states of the corresponding representations. Let tr(π(1)) = d. Deleting the vanishing rows and columns from S- 112R(1)< 12 > 3(λ)  S12 and S- 112R(2)< 12 > 3(λ)  S12, yields a d  ×  d3 and (d1  ×  d2 - d)  ×  d3 dimensional square matrix, respectively.

It is possible to fuse two matrices R(i)< 12 > 3(λ) to obtain a matrix R(i)< 12 >  < 34 >(λ). Setting μ  =  ρ in ([\ref=ybefus1]) and multiplying by the projection operators yields two equations similar to ([\ref=ybep1],[\ref=ybep2]). This leads to the following definitions:

[formula]

Using the same methods as above one easily shows that these matrices satisfy two Yang-Baxter equations (i = 1,2):

[formula]

Again S- 134R(i)< 12 >  < 34 >(λ)  S34, i = 1,2, still satisfy the above YBE's. Removing by hand a certain number of vanishing columns and rows, one obtains matrices with smaller dimensions.

Assume now that the original R-matrix is regular and unitary, i.e.

[formula]

where P is the permutation operator. The function f(λ) is then even, and c is an arbitrary non-vanishing complex number. The fused matrices ([\ref=fus3],[\ref=fus4]) inherit this property. It is however necessary to correctly normalize them for the corresponding value of c not to vanish. This is achieved by the following normalization: redefine R(i)< 12 >  < 34 >(λ) as the right-hand side of ([\ref=fus3],[\ref=fus4]) multiplied by [formula]. The reason for this normalization is the vanishing of f(ρ), for otherwise the projector R12(ρ) would be invertible and therefore equal to the trivial identity projector [formula].

The limit λ  →  0 for the redefined matrices ([\ref=fus3]-[\ref=fus4]) has to be taken with care. Using the YBE one arrives at:

[formula]

where R(i)< 34 >  < 12 >(λ) = P13P24  R(i)< 12 >  < 34 >(λ)  P13P24.

Having obtained regular solutions of the YBE, the usual procedure for constructing integrable spin-chain Hamiltonians with short-range interaction is by taking logarithmic derivatives of the transfer matrices at λ = 0. The quadratic hamiltonian density of such integrable hierarchies is nothing but the derivative at λ = 0 of the matrix [formula]. Inclusion of the normalizing factor gives:

[formula]

Taking the limit λ  →  0, I find:

[formula]

The two signs are as in the regularity equations above. The first term is proportional to the identity and may be dropped.

It is in fact possible to fuse an arbitrary product of R matrices to obtain solutions of the YBE corresponding to most representations of a given Lie algebra. This was carried out in detail for sl(2) and sl(3) in [\cite=krs] [\cite=kr], and also works for the other algebras [\cite=kns].

The above fusing scheme is now shown to work for the multiplicity Am - 1 models.

New integrable models

As seen above, apart from satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation, the projector property is the only additional ingredient needed to construct fused matrices. In particular R does not have to correspond to a smallest representation to be able to apply the fusion method. The degeneration of the generically invertible R-matrix to a projector, for a certain value of the spectral parameter, is not automatic. It is however a quite common property, especially for the R-matrices based on Lie algebras. For the models studied here, a quantum group structure does not seem to exist, and one has to verify that a projector point exists.

I now apply this formalism to the models of [\cite=amp]. This will yield new matrices which define new integrable hierarchies. The models of [\cite=amp] are defined as follows. Take positive integers ni and m such that

[formula]

The inequality restrictions avoid multiple counting of models, but can otherwise be relaxed. The set of n basis states is the disjoint union of m sets Ai:

[formula]

Ai should not be confused with the Lie algebra sl(i + 1). Let Eαβ be a square matrix with a one at row α and column β and zeros otherwise. Define the following operators:

[formula]

The twist parameters were taken equal to one arbitrary complex parameter x. Let y = eiλ and q = eiγ, where λ is the spectral parameter and γ the quantum parameter. The R-matrix is then given by:

[formula]

This model is denoted by (n1,...,nm;m,n). For n = m and x = 1 one obtains the Am - 1 R-matrix of [\cite=jimbo]. R(λ) is regular and unitary:

[formula]

where R21(λ) = P12  R12(λ)  P12. As seen in section [\ref=fusionsec], these properties are inherited by some of the fused matrices.

The right-hand side of ([\ref=unit]) shows that λ  =    ±  γ are possible projector points. Further checks show that matrix ([\ref=ram]) yields a projector at λ  =  ρ =  - γ: R( - γ) =   -  P̃ sin γ. Let

[formula]

One has: (π(i))2  =  π(i), i = 1,2, and π(1)π(2)  =  π(2)π(1) = 0. The dimensions of these projectors are given by their traces:

[formula]

The matrix S which diagonalizes π(1) and π(2) is given by:

[formula]

The diagonalized projectors then read

[formula]

The explicit expressions of the four fused matrices R(i)< 12 > 3 and R(i)< 12 >  < 34 > can be found by straightforward if tedious expansions of the products in ([\ref=fus1],[\ref=fus2],[\ref=fus3],[\ref=fus4]), using the explicit expressions ([\ref=ram],[\ref=proj],[\ref=ss],[\ref=ss1]). Similarly, the quadratic hamiltonian density is obtained by replacing the matrices in ([\ref=hamden]) and expanding the products.

The following point is worth mentioning. Since R12( - γ)  R21(γ) = 0, it may seem that the complementary projector π(2) is proportional to R21(γ). However this is generically not the case. It is true only when all the ni are equal to one and x = q±  1. This is another distinguishing feature of the [formula] models.

Some sl(2) models

Consider now the m = 2 case, i.e. the XXC models [\cite=xxc]. They have an underlying sl(2) structure. Their R matrix is just the multistate version of the one corresponding to the spin-[formula] model (n1 = n2 = 1).

Tedious but simple calculations lead to the following matrix which carries spin-0×  spin-[formula]:

[formula]

The dimension of this matrix is n1  n2  n, as expected. The corresponding two-dimensional vertex model has n1  n2 possible states on, e.g., the horizontal links and n states on the vertical links.

Note that the x + x- 1 denominator has dropped out of the final result and therefore R is defined for all finite values of x, including x =   ±  i. This also holds for the three fused matrices given below.

The matrix which carries spin-0×  spin-0 can then be obtained:

[formula]

P(A2)13 and P(A1)24 are the permutation operators in the subspaces A2 and A1, respectively. The dimension of this matrix is (n1n2)2, as it should be. It satisfies the regularity and unitarity properties ([\ref=regs1],[\ref=units]). Here the vertex model has n1  n2 possible states on both the horizontal and vertical links. The resulting spin-chain is however rather trivial as the λ-dependence can be normalized away, and the operator part yields S- 112π(1)12S12  S- 134π(1)34S34, i.e. the identity operators in the spin-0 subspaces.

The matrix carrying spin-1×  spin-[formula] is:

[formula]

The vertex model model has (n1)2  +  (n2)2 + n1  n2 states on the horizontal links and n states on the vertical links.

The preceding matrix is then used to find the spin-1×  spin-1 matrix:

[formula]

This matrix does satisfy the regularity and unitarity properties ([\ref=regs2],[\ref=units]). The number of states on both the horizontal and vertical links is now (n1)2  +  (n2)2 + n1  n2.

The four matrices ([\ref=rm012],[\ref=rm00],[\ref=rm112],[\ref=rm11]) have 2, 1, 10, 19 types of terms, respectively. This was expected from the Sz conservation of sl(2). When n1 = n2 = 1 the matrices give the sl(2) 2-, 1-, 10-, 19-vertex models. The latter two models can be found in [\cite=fzmod] [\cite=ppny] [\cite=mene2]. To carry out a comparison it is necessary to relabel the states so that R looks like an operator acting on the tensor product of two spaces: [formula]. For instance, in ([\ref=rm112]), with A1  =  {1}, A2  =  {2}, one can take the matrix element [formula] to correspond to [formula], and [formula] to [formula]. The matrix (19) of reference [\cite=mene2] can be obtained by fusing the symmetric form of the sl(2) R-matrix [\cite=xxc]. It is also necessary to do a gauge transformation after fusing, in order to render the resulting matrix completely symmetric. This introduces the unusual square-root element d of that reference. Finally, let u = λ  +  η / 2 and η  =  γ to complete the identification. Similar remarks apply to the identification of the 19-vertex models.

The interpretation of the multiple-states in terms of sl(2) states is simple. Recall first that for the models ([\ref=ram]) with m = 2, the interpretation is:

[formula]

This yields the following identifications when two spin-[formula] spaces are fused:

[formula]

for the spin 0 representation obtained from π(1), and

[formula]

for the spin 1 representation obtained from π(2). The numbers on the right are the number of states of the corresponding type. Whereas the numbers of copies of the states |  ±  1〉 are uncorrelated, (n1)2 and (n2)2, the number of states of type |0〉 has to be n1  n2. Thus a naive trial to obtain the multistate version of the spin-1×  spin-1 model would have failed. Fusion gives the correct answer.

The first derivative at λ = 0 of [formula], for the matrix of ([\ref=rm11]), gives the hamiltonian density Hii + 1 for the multistate version of the spin-1 model. The n1 = n2 = 1 Hamiltonian is also known as the Fateev-Zamolodchikov model [\cite=fzmod].

Concluding remarks

The multiplicity Am - 1 models were shown to allow fusion and multistate models were obtained for higher dimensional representations. The spin-0 and spin-1 models were derived explicitly. This provided in particular the generalization of the Fateev-Zamolodchikov model.

The underlying sl(m) structure of these models was justified in [\cite=amp]. It provides a natural way to label them in terms of sl(m) representations. This language has been used throughout the paper and in particular in section [\ref=sl2]. I recall here the main points in view of an extension to the higher dimensional models just obtained. The matrices ([\ref=ram]) have the following structure: [formula], where all the spectral parameter dependence is contained in the functions gk(λ). The operators Ok may depend on the other parameters. Replacing R in the YBE's it is required to satisfy, and identifying the coefficients of the linearly independent functions yield a set of equations for the operators Ok, where the spectral parameters do not appear. In the case of the [formula] of ([\ref=ram]) one has simple ni-independent trigonometric functions, and obtains the Hecke algebra, for all values of the ni's, and in particular for ni = 1. This and the fact that the operators have the same structure as for ni = 1 shows that one has the natural generalization. The algebraic Bethe Ansatz was also found to be based on the Dynkin diagram of Am - 1. Thus the functional and operatorial structures of [formula] are the same as for ni = 1. The quite general fusion construction reviewed in section [\ref=fusionsec] preserves the functional and algebraic structures. Therefore one again has the natural multistate generalization for the higher dimensional representations.

The rational limit of all the matrices considered above exist and provide rational solutions to the various Yang-Baxter equations. This limit is obtained by rescaling λ to γλ, and dividing by an appropriate power of γ or sin γ in order to obtain a finite limit.

The models ([\ref=ram]) have extended symmetries [\cite=amp]: [formula]. It is obvious that the higher dimensional models inherit similar symmetries. These are related to the existence of many states of a same type, as seen in the spin-0 and spin-1 examples. Most (but not all) diagonal operators commute with the R-matrix, as they either correspond to u(1) charges of states of the same type, or to realizations of Sz. The non-diagonal operators which commute with the R-matrix are those which acts within the space spanned by a state and its copies.

These symmetries will also be reflected in a diagonalization by Bethe Ansatz, as happened for the fundamental models [\cite=amp]. The diagonalization makes use of the standard techniques associated with higher dimensional representations. In particular, it uses fusion to find relations between the various transfer matrices.
