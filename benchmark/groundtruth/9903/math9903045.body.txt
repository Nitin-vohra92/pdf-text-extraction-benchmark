Addendum To: On fibre space structures of a projective irreducible symplectic manifold

In this note, we prove that every fibre space of a projective irreducible manifold is a lagrangian fibration.

Let X be a projective irreducible symplectic manifold and f:X  →  B a fibre space with projective base B. Then f is a lagrangian fibration, that is a general fibre of f is a lagrangian submanifold.

Remark.   Beauville proves that a Lagrangian fibration is a complete integrable system in [\cite=beauville2]. Thus, a general fibre of a fibre space of a projective irreducible symplectic manifold is an abelian variety.

Remark.   Markshevich states in [\cite=mark1] that there exists an irreducible symplectic manifold which has a family of non lagrangian tori. But this family does not form fibration.

Proof of Theorem.   Let ω be a nondegenerate two form on X and [formula] a conjugate. Assume that dim X  =  2n. Then dim F  =  n [\cite=matsu], where F is a general fibre of f. In order to prove that F is a Lagrangian submanifold, it is enough to show

[formula]

where A is an ample divisor on X. Let H' be an ample divisor on B and H: = f*H'. Then

[formula]

where c is a nonzero constant. We shall show ωAn - 2Hn  =  0. By [\cite=fujiki], there exists a bilinear form qX on [formula] which has the following properties:

[formula]

We consider the following equation,

[formula]

Calculating the left hand side, we obtain

[formula]

Since ω∈H0(X,Ω2X) and A,H∈H1(X,Ω1X),

[formula]

by [\cite=beauville]. Thus we can conclude that ωAn - 2Hn  =  0 by comparing sn - 2tn term of both hands sides. Q.E.D.
