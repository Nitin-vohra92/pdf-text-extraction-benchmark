Recently an important and intriguing duality has been proposed by Maldacena that states the equivalence between the string/M theory compactified on the anti-de Sitter space (AdS) and certain superconformal field theory living on the boundary of the AdS [\cite=JM]. This duality was suggested by the fact that the near-horizon geometries of typical brane configurations such as D3-brane, M2-brane and M5-brane are given by the product spaces, AdS5  ×  S5,AdS4  ×  S7 and AdS7  ×  S4 respectively. For the non-extremal N coincident D3-branes the thermal gravitational action was constructed to give the free energy of the four dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with U(N) gauge symmety in the limit of large N and strong 't Hooft coupling and further the leading correction in inverse powers of the 't Hooft coupling was calculated [\cite=GKP] [\cite=KT] [\cite=GKT]. The four dimensional SYM free energy was shown to be related with the supergravity interaction potential between the N coincident D3-brane source and a D3-brane probe, which is derived by evaluating the effective DBI action of the D3-brane probe in the near-horizon D3-brane background [\cite=TY]. The supergravity interaction potential is interpreted as the contribution of the massive states to the SYM free energy in the Higgs phase.

The conformal D3-brane system was extended to the N coincident non-conformal Dp-brane system where the Dp-brane supergravity solution, that is obtained in the decoupling limit, interpolates between the p  +  1 dimensional perturbative SYM theory and the different limits of string/M theory [\cite=IMSY]. For the theories on these different domains the entropies were calculated and expressed in terms of the energy, the volume of the system and so on. They were shown to match near the transition regions which are specified by the critical energies [\cite=BISY]. Recently combining the Maldacena conjecture with the Matrix theory the rich structure of phase diagram for the various near-horizon D-brane systems has been explored and described by the entropy and the volume of the system [\cite=LMS]. On the other hand the free energy for the Dp-brane supergravity solution was calculated [\cite=EW] [\cite=BR] and the effects of the light spatial winding modes and the light temporal winding modes were investigated [\cite=BKR]. Taking account of these stringy modification and Hagedorn behavior the phase diagram was constructed to be described by gsN and the temperature.

Based on the free energy consideration we will show that the free energy of the N Dp-brane system becomes that of the p  +  1 dimensional weakly-coupled SYM theory near the transition region specified by the critical temperature. Near the strong coupling transition region the Dp-brane supergravity free energy will be shown to match onto the free energy of the conformal field theory (CFT) description or the description associated with M theory. From the alternative view point the free energy for the supergravity description will be reproduced by integrating approximately the finite temperature partition function in the canonical ensemble. We will compute the effective DBI action of a Dp-brane probe in the non-extremal Dp-brane background and investigate how it is related with the Dp-brane supergravity free energy.

Further we will consider a system of near-extremal Q1 D1-branes and Q5 D5-branes in the IIB string theory where the D5-branes are wrapped on T4. The decoupling limit yields the IIB string theory on T4  ×  S3  ×  AdS3 which is dual to a certain two dimensional CFT [\cite=JM]. The obtained six dimensional supergravity solution contains not only the D1-brane but also a solitonic string which is produced by wrapping the D5-brane on T4. Compactifying the string direction leads to a five dimensional black hole. We will derive the free energy for the five dimensional near-horizon black hole specified by two charges only and construct the action of a D1-brane or D5-brane probe in the Q1 D1-brane and Q5 D5-brane background. Combining them we will search for a relation between each thermal probe action and the free energy of the D1 + D5 system.

Let us begin to write down the string-frame metric and dilaton for N coincident non-extremal Dp-branes with toroidal topology S1  ×  Tp for fixing the notation

[formula]

where H is a harmonic function of the transverse coordinates

[formula]

and h is the Schwarzschild-like harmonic function h  =  1  -  (r0 / r)7 - p. The 'electric' component of the Ramond-Ramond (RR) (p  +  1)-form potential is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

with [formula] and we use gs as the asymptotic string coupling, gs  =  eφ∞. The event horizon at r  =  r0 yields the Hawking temperature

[formula]

which is associated with the period β  =  1 / T of the Euclidean time. By compactifying the spatial coordinates [formula] on a p-dimensional torus, we have a D  =  10  -  p dimensional black hole. Its string-frame metric is transformed into the Einstein-frame one which gives the ADM mass

[formula]

where G is the ten dimensional Newton constant, G  =  8π6g2sl8s and [formula] is the volume of the unit (8 - p)-sphere. The area of the surface at the event horizon gives the entropy

[formula]

with the D dimensional Newton constant GD  =  G / Vp, which is also expressed as

[formula]

Here we take the decoupling limit

[formula]

which implies the near-horizon limit for the Dp-brane solution. In SYM picture with gauge coupling constant gYM,U is the finite expectation value of the Higgs. From ([\ref=met]) under this field theory limit we have a blow-up throat manifold Xbh with metric

[formula]

which shows a AdS-like geometry with a varing radius of curvature. The corresponding mass is obtained from ([\ref=adm]) as

[formula]

with the mass of the extremal Dp-brane MEDp  =  (7 - p)ω8 - pVpL7 - p / 16πG. In Ref. [\cite=BKR] the action or free energy of the near-horizon manifold Xbh is presented by

[formula]

with

[formula]

In the limit r0  →  0 the manifold Xbh becomes a blow-up throat of the extremal Dp-brane solution, which is denoted by Xvac. It has zero entropy and mass MEDp so that I(Xvac)  =  βMEDp. The action difference between Xbh and Xvac yields the free energy for the Dp-brane supergravity solution

[formula]

Now we are ready to argue the transition between the supergravity description and the perturbative SYM description from the view point of the free energy. The free energy for the supergravity solution is rewritten in terms of gsN and T as

[formula]

where

[formula]

For p  =  3 the free energy reads [formula] [\cite=GKP] [\cite=KT] [\cite=GKT]. At a given temperature T which is related with the non-exremality parameter r0  =  U0α' through ([\ref=bt]), the effective dimensionless coupling constant in the corresponding U(N) SYM theory is given by [\cite=IMSY] [\cite=BISY]

[formula]

so that it depends on the temperature. Since the supergravity description can be trusted in the region geff  >  1, the transition region is characterized by geff  ~  1, that is

[formula]

We would like to see how the free energy behaves at the transition region. Substituting the relation ([\ref=gt]) specifying a critical line in the (gsN,T) plane into the supergravity free energy ([\ref=fc]) we have

[formula]

It should be noted that the ls dependence has been cancelled out. The obtained expression shows the scaling of the free energy for the p  +  1 dimensional perturbative SYM theory which has N2 degrees of freedom for the adjoint representation of U(N). Since the perturbative SYM theory region geff  <  1 is expressed as

[formula]

the perturbative SYM theory gives the high temperature description for p  <  3 and the low temperature description for 3  <  p  <  5, when compared with the supergravity description. Using an interesting relation U0  ≈  geffT, which is obtained from ([\ref=gef]) and ([\ref=bt]), we make the free energy ([\ref=fr]) change into a simple and suggestive form

[formula]

The free energy for the non-conformal Dp-brane system for geff  >  1 is regarded as the strongly-coupled free energy for the large N SYM theory with the effective dimensionless coupling constant geff, which shows the planar behavior. It becomes the conformal one only when p  =  3. As seen above it reduces to ([\ref=fy]) obviously near the transition region geff  ~  1.

Here we consider the partition function in the canonical ensemble for the Dp-brane system. From the elimination of r0 between ([\ref=mbh]) and ([\ref=sb]) with ([\ref=bt]) the entropy can be expressed in terms of the mass as

[formula]

where the positive constant γ includes a factor [formula]. Using the energy of Dp-brane above the extremality E  =  M  -  MEDp we see that the density of states for the near-horizon Dp-brane system grows like n(E)  ~  eS(E). The partition function given by

[formula]

well converges when (9 - p) / 2(7 - p) < 1, that is p  <  5. It is interesting to note that a critical behavior emerges at p  =  5. In the integration the saddle point is estimated with a positive constant ε as

[formula]

from which the partition function is approximately evaluated as

[formula]

We can observe that the free energy F  =   - T log Z reproduces the same expression as ([\ref=fc]) including a characteristic coefficient (5 - p). For the peculiar p  =  5 case the entropy is linearly rising with energy which is similar to the dynamical string [\cite=JMM]. The free energy shows a logarithmic singular behavior when the temperature is near the Hagedorn temperature of the effective string, [formula].

Alternatively we use a different parameter α accompanied with r0 to give

[formula]

The extremal limit is given by r0  →  0,α  →    ∞   with L7 - p fixed. Here we work on the radial coordinate defined by the shift transformation r̂d  =  rd  +  rd0 sinh 2α with d  =  7  -  p, used in Ref. [\cite=HS]. The event horizon at r  =  r0 and the curvature singularity at r  =  0 are transformed into an outer event horizon specifed by r̂7 - p+  =  r7 - p0 cosh 2α and an inner horizon, r̂7 - p-  =  r7 - p0 sinh 2α respectively. The RR charge of the N coincident Dp-branes is

[formula]

with κ2  =  8πG, and the extremal limit yields r̂7 - p+,r̂7 - p-  →  L7 - p. In our notation [formula] becomes [formula]. The ADM mass ([\ref=adm]) of the starting non blow-up manifold can be described by

[formula]

which is compared to another expression

[formula]

with

[formula]

Thus we derive the generalized Smarr formula for the mass of D dimensional charged black hole and Φ can be regarded as the 'electric potential' on the outer event horizon [\cite=GM].

Furthermore, we will return to analyze the free energy ([\ref=fc]) for the Dp-brane supergravity solution in both the high and low temperature regions. First for the supergravity solution carrying the D2-brane charge in the high temperature region the 2 + 1 dimensional perturbative SYM theory governs the dynamics while the low temperature region is described by the N coincident M2-brane solution localized in the compact dimension in M theory, which gives the CFT with SO(8) R-symmetry [\cite=NS]. This phase transition takes place at U0  ~  g2YM [\cite=IMSY] which gives a transition line [formula]. From ([\ref=fc]) the D2-brane supergravity free energy scales as F  ~   - N5 / 3g- 1 / 3s(Tls)10 / 3V2l- 3s. By eliminating gs we see that on the transition line it turns out to be

[formula]

In Refs. [\cite=KT] [\cite=GKT] the entropies of the non-dilatonic N coincident p-branes such as D3, M2 and M5 branes were evaluated and each free energy was shown to be

[formula]

which is that of the CFT in p + 1 dimensions. The expression ([\ref=fdt]) is just the form characteristic of the free energy for the 2 + 1 dimensional CFT. This conformal behavior is also seen directly from ([\ref=fge]) since the low temperature phase transition is specified by g2eff  ~  N, which is compared with the high temperature transition line geff  ~  1.

For the N coincident D4-branes the supergravity description is replaced by the SYM theory in the low temperature region. The high temperature region is described by the N coincident M5-branes wrapped on the eleventh dimensional circle with radius R11  =  gsls in M theory. The wrapped M5-brane region g2YMU0  >  N1 / 3 [\cite=IMSY] corresponds to the high temperature region T  >  1 / (gslsN1 / 3). The supergravity free energy F  =   - CN3gsT6V4ls with C  =  273- 7π4 for the D4-branes in ([\ref=fc]) becomes

[formula]

on the transition line. On the other hand corresponding to ([\ref=fcf]) with p  =  5 the 5 + 1 dimensional conformal system on the N coincident M5-brane world-volume has a free energy F  =   - 263- 7π3N3T6V5 [\cite=KT] [\cite=GKT]. So the free energy of the wrapped M5-brane is estimated as -  CN3T6V4gsls, since its volume is V5  =  V42πR11. From this side the free energy on the transition line becomes ([\ref=fdf]) as well. Thus the N coincident D4-branes as well as the N coincident wrapped M5-branes provide the same free energy expression, which covers the whole geff  >  1 region.

The N coincident D1-brane system whose high temperature region is described by the two dimensional perturbative SYM theory, is also replaced by a two dimensional free orbifold CFT [\cite=DVV] in the low temperature region. The orbifold CFT region is characterized by U0  <  gYM [\cite=IMSY], that is, [formula]. The free energy ([\ref=fc]) with p  =  1 is given by F  ~   - N3 / 2g- 1 / 2sT3V1ls , which becomes

[formula]

along the low temperature transition line specified by gs  ~  (Tls)2N. Its expression just shows the scaling of the free energy for the two dimensional CFT, Eq.([\ref=fcf]) with p = 1. This conformal structure also emerges from ([\ref=fge]) on the transition region specified by g2eff  ~  N. Thus in the canonical ensemble we have demonstrated the matching of the free energies near the transition line with the temperatures of both sides equally fixed, which is compared with the entropy matching with the energies of both sides equally fixed that was performed in Ref. [\cite=BISY] from the view point of microcanonical ensemble.

We further proceed to the N coincident D0-brane system which in the low temperature region is replaced by the matrix black hole system in eleven dimensions. The matrix black hole region is specified by U0  <  g2 / 3YMN1 / 9 [\cite=IMSY], that is translated into T  <  g1 / 3sN- 2 / 9l- 1s. The free energy for the D0-brane solution scales as F  ~   - N7 / 5g- 3 / 5s(Tls)14 / 5l- 1s. The substitution of gs  ~  (TN2 / 9ls)3 yields a simple scaling form of the free energy

[formula]

along the critical line. Therefore, the corresponding entropy is just given by S  ~  N. In Ref. [\cite=BFKS], the matching of mass-entropy scaling between the Matrix theory compactified on Td and the Schwarzschild black hole in (11 - d) dimensions was exhibited by setting S  ~  N. Our result corresponds to the d  =  0 case. This Matrix theory behavior arises directly from ([\ref=fge]) since the critical line is again expressed as g2eff  ~  N.

We now turn our attention to a system that a single Dp-brane probe is separated by a distance r from N coincident non-extremal Dp-branes (source). The world-volume action of a Dp-brane probe in the Dp-brane background is given by

[formula]

where C(p + 1) represents the RR (p + 1)-form potential that couples to the Dp-brane charge and [formula] and Tp is the Dp-brane tension Tp  =  1 / (2π)plp + 1sgs. The Dp-brane probe will be considered to be static and parallel to the source. Choosing a static gauge and substituting the background solution ()  -  () into ([\ref=dbi]) we have an effective action of a Dp-brane probe at a position r

[formula]

where Vp is the volume of the spatial directions along the Dp-brane. In the field theory limit ([\ref=dcl]) that also means L  ≫  r0,L  ≫  r, the free energy Fpr  =  I / β of the Dp-brane probe becomes

[formula]

The expansion in r0 / r leads to the supergravity interaction potential between a Dp-brane probe and the Dp-brane source. In terms of the two parameters with energy dimension, M  =  (r5 - p / L7 - p)1 / 2 and T  =  (r5 - p0 / L7 - p)1 / 2(7 - p) / 4π, which are in a similar form, the free energy is expressed as

[formula]

Here we consider the long distance region r  ≫  r0 where a Dp-brane probe is far away from the source. Under the corresponding low temperature expansion in T / M of ([\ref=fpr]) the leading term is computed by

[formula]

with C defined in ([\ref=cc]). Let us denote the free energy for the N coincident Dp-branes ([\ref=fc]) by F(N). In the large N limit we can find a relation

[formula]

In the N + 1 Dp-brane system one Dp-brane is far away from N others. Subtracting the free energy for the N coincident Dp-branes (source) from that for the whole N  +  1 Dp-brane system we can extract the free energy for the single Dp-brane probe in the N Dp-brane background. The presence of the Dp-brane probe at a distance r from the N Dp-brane source gives an expectation value U  =  r / α' to the Higgs field and leads to the gauge symmetry breaking U(N + 1)  →  U(N)  ×  U(1). The mass of an open string stretched between the probe and the source is given by U / 2π. In this picture F(N) in ([\ref=sup]), the free energy of the N coincident Dp-branes (source) is considered to be given by the massless constribution only. Therefore the probe free energy in ([\ref=sup]) can be interpreted as the contribution of the massive open strings in the supergravity side, or alternatively, the contribution of massive SYM modes. The derivation of ([\ref=sup]) on the other hand supports the existence of the characteristic coefficient (5 - p) in the free energy expression ([\ref=fc]) for the near-horizon Dp-brane system.

Here we consider a system of Q5 D5-branes and Q1 D1-branes in the IIB string theory compactified on T4. The D1-brane is parallel to the instanton string in six dimensions arising from the D5-brane wrapped around T4. The low energy dynamics of this system is described by the Higgs branch of two dimensional U(Q1)  ×  U(Q5) SYM gauge theory. The IR limit of it is given by the two dimensional (4,4) super CFT with central charge c  =  6Q1Q5 [\cite=MD]. We write down the ten dimensional metric for the D1 + D5 brane system

[formula]

where [formula] are the coordinates on T4 and y is the coordinate along the D1-brane, r21  =  gsQ1l2s / v and r25  =  gsQ5l2s. In the decoupling limit defined by

[formula]

with V4 the volume of T4, the D1 + D5 system reduces to the IIB string theory on AdS3  ×  S3  ×  T4 with the same radius for AdS3 and S3, which is conjectured to be dual to the two dimensional (4,4) super CFT. Recently this type of AdS/CFT correspondence has been explored [\cite=SA] to be associated with the three dimesional BTZ black hole and the AdS3 Chern-Simons gravity. Further compactifying on S1 of length 2πR along y direction we get a non-extremal five dimesional black hole labeled by two charges, Q1 and Q5. In the dilute gas condition r0  ≪  r1,r5, which is contained in the decoupling limit ([\ref=dfo]), the black hole mass and entropy are given by

[formula]

with the five dimensional Newton constant G5  =  G / V42πR and the area of the event horizon A  =  π2r1r5r0. In the extremal limit r0  →  0 the entropy vanishes, which is compared to the non-zero entropy of the five dimensional extremal black hole with three charges, Q1,Q5 and further momentum running along the string [\cite=HMS] [\cite=CM]. The non-extremality parameter r0 is linear to the Hawking temperature as r0  =  2πr1r5T, that is similarly seen in the near-horizon D3-brane system. Gathering together we obtain the free energy

[formula]

Subtracting the extremal part in the same way as the previous Dp-brane system we have F(Q1,Q5)  =   - 2π2Q1Q5RT2, which shows the expected scaling for the free energy of the 1 + 1 dimensional CFT. In deriving F(Q1,Q5) we have observed that the dependences of gs and ls are cancelled out. It agrees with ([\ref=fcf]) with p  =  1,V1 = 2πR and N  =  Q1Q5. The combination Q1Q5 may be associated with the degrees of freedom in the dual CFT, that is, the central charge c  =  6Q1Q5 or the number of the open strings connected between D1-branes and D5-branes in a free string gas [\cite=CM]. So we have an interesting expression F(Q1,Q5) / 2πR  =   - cπT2 / 6.

The action ([\ref=dbi]) with p  =  1 for a static D1-brane probe in the D1 + D5 brane background can be expressed in the decoupling limit as

[formula]

where e- 2φ  =  H5 / H1 is taken into account and H1 is given by H1  ~  gsQ1l2s / vr2. Similar probe actions were studied in Ref.[\cite=DPS], where the five dimensional black hole with three charges are argued. Under the long distance expansion in r0 / r the leading term in the free energy of a D1-brane probe at a position r is estimated as

[formula]

which is further rewritten in terms of T as

[formula]

Comparing the two free energies we can derive a fascinating relation

[formula]

which shows the same subtractive behavior as ([\ref=sup]). Thus the free energy for a D1-brane probe separated from the Q1 D1-brane and Q5 D5-brane source can be expressed as a difference between the free energy for Q1  +  1 D1-brane and Q5 D5-brane system and that for Q1 D1-brane and Q5 D5-brane system. Therefore it can be interpreted as the contribution of the Q5 massive open strings stretched from the Q5 D5-branes to the single D1-brane probe.

Further we repeat a similar analysis for the D5-brane probe in the same background. In the action ([\ref=dbi]) with p  =  5 for a D5-brane probe the decoupling limit yields

[formula]

with V5  =  V42πR. The leading part of the low temperature expansion for the associated free energy is given by

[formula]

A similar relation is again encountered as

[formula]

which consistently shows the free energy for the D5-brane probe separated from the non-extremal D1 + D5 source. The free energy F5 is also characterized by the Q1 massive open strings stretched between the single D5-brane probe and the Q1 D1-branes.

We have analyzed the free energies of the N coincident non-conformal D0, D1 and D2 brane systems and observed the free energy matchings by deriving the perturbative SYM free energies in the high temperature transition region as well as the free energies of the matrix black hole, the free orbifold CFT and the CFT with SO(8) R-symmetry in the low temperature transition region. We have presented the generalized Smarr formula for the mass of D  =  10  -  p dimensional black hole obtained upon dimensional reduction from the ten dimensional N coincident non-extremal Dp-brane system. The DBI action of the Dp-brane probe in the N coincident Dp-brane background has been shown to be related in a subtractive form with the Dp-brane supergravity free energy and interpreted as the contribution of massive modes in the SYM picture associated with the U(N + 1)  →  U(N)  ×  U(1) symmetry breaking. It is interesting to note that the characteristic (5 - p) factor in the Dp-brane supergravity free energy is reproduced by calculating the finite temperature partition function in the canonical ensemble and also plays an important role in order to obtain the subtractive relation.

The free energy of the five dimensional black hole with two charges obtained upon dimensional reduction from the near-horizon D1 + D5 brane system has been constructed and shown to agree with that of the two dimensional super CFT. Its free energy is characterized by the number of open strings connected between the D1-branes and the D5-branes. We have also found the subtractive relation between its free energy and the D1-brane or D5-brane probe action in the D1 + D5 background. The obtained two relations, which are symmetric each other, imply a simple and consistent picture that the free energy associated with the D1-brane or D5-brane probe action is regarded as the constribution of the massive open strings stretched between the single probe D1-brane and the source D5-branes or vice versa.

It is worth noting that though we have found the similar subtractive relations in the two near-horizon systems, the N Dp-brane system and the D1 + D5 system, there is a slight difference. The former AdS-like geometry is associated with the strongly-coupled p  +  1 dimensional U(N) SYM interacting gauge theory itself, while the latter AdS itself is associated with the free string gas, or equivalently the IR limit of the Higgs branch of two dimensional U(Q1)  ×  U(Q5) SYM gauge theory. This difference is reflected in the numbers of relevant degrees of freedom and the free energy expressions. It would be interesting to investigate whether there exist the similar subtractive relations between the free energy and the D-brane probe action in the near-horizon systems for the bound state of the Dp-branes and the D(p - 4)-branes, and the other bound states in order to gain deeper understandings of the duality between the near-horizon system and the underlying CFT from the thermodynamical view point.
