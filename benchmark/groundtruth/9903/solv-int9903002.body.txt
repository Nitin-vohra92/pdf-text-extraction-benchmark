1. Introduction

The Hamiltonian mechanics (HM) is in the ground of mathematical description of the physical theories, [\cite=fad]. But HM is in a sense blind, e.g., it does not make difference between two opposites: the ergodic Hamiltonian systems (with just one integral of motion) and integrable Hamiltonian systems (with maximal number of the integrals of motion).

By our proposal, Nambu's mechanics (NM) [\cite=nambu] is proper generalization of the HM, which makes difference between dynamical systems with different numbers of integrals of motion explicit.

In this paper we introduce a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations which in a particular case reduces to Volterra's system, [\cite=volterra] and integrate this system using Nambu-Poisson formalism, [\cite=nambu] [\cite=leon].

In Sec.2 of this paper we introduce the dynamical system. In Sec.3 and Sec.4 we construct a complete set of integrals of motion in two particular cases for which we found the general solutions in quadratures. In Sec.5 we found some integrals of motion in the general case and present our conclusions.

2.  The system

In this section we introduce the following dynamical system
