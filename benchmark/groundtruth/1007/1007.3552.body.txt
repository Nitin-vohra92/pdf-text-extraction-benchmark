Estimating complex eigenvalues of non-self adjoint Schrödinger operators via complex dilations

Introduction

The purpose of this note is to take up up the following problem suggested by C. Villani [\cite=Villani] in the proceedings of the last ICM, quoted here (with notation slightly changed): The stated problem is a model for the phenomenon of "hypocoercivity," with the specific form motivated by applications described in [\cite=Villani] and outlined briefly below.

It turns out that a sufficient condition on f for divergence of the real parts of the eigenvalues may be obtained using a general result due to Constantin, Kiselev, Ryzhik and Zlato [\cite=CKRZ]. Specifically, we will show below that:

The real parts of the eigenvalues of Lγ diverge to ∞   as γ  →    ∞   if {x:f(x) = t} is essentially nowhere dense for each [formula].

However, the question of estimating the rate of divergence seems to be much more delicate. In particular, it is likely that the rate will depend on the specific form of f and thus we may not expect such a general result. Nonetheless, as we will show below, a number of interesting examples with analytic f may be analyzed with the technique of complex dilations, yielding, in one case at least, a very good estimate on the rate.

The method of complex dilations, as applied below, essentially require that f be analytic, possibly with a branch point. Furthermore, as the proof will show, the asymptotic growth of eigenvalues depends essentially on f only in the neighborhood of a critical point. If the potential has multiple critical points one may expect each of these to contribute. For the sake of clarity, we will not try to formulate a very general result, but rather focus on a function f with a single critical point to see how the behavior of the spectrum depends on the behavior of f near the critical point. Specifically, we will consider

[formula]

for arbitrary κ > 0. The main result of this paper is

Fix κ > 0 and let f(x) be as in [\eqref=eq:formof]. Then there is a positive constant Cκ such that all eigenvalues of Lγ lie in the half plane

[formula]

In [\cite=Villani], this problem is motivated as a simplified version of a spectral problem that arises in the linear stability analysis of a 2D hydrodynamic equation. In that context, one is mainly interested in understanding the t  →    ∞   asymptotic behavior of solutions to the the initial value problem

[formula]

The semi-group [formula] generates solutions to [\eqref=eq:ivp] via ψ(x,t)  =  Stψ0(x). It follows that the large t asymptotic behavior is governed by the eigenvalue of Lγ with smallest real part. Indeed,

[formula]

for any [formula], where for [formula] we let [formula]. Hence, the conclusion of the theorem implies that

[formula]

for solutions to [\eqref=eq:ivp].

The estimate [\eqref=eq:semigroup] is quite striking as, in some sense, the convergence of ψ  →  0 is driven entirely by the "dissipative" term ∂2xψ  -  x2ψ on the right. Indeed, without the dissipative term, the solution would be

[formula]

which has constant L2 norm. If the L2 conserving term [formula] is absent then the L2 norm goes to zero, but at the modest rate [formula] given by finding the smallest eigenvalue of L0. However the combination of the "conservative" and "dissipative" terms results in much faster convergence to zero. This phenomenon has been dubbed "hypocoercivity" by Villani, in analogy with Hörmander's notion of "hypoelipticity."

From another point of view, this is not so surprising. After all, those of us who add milk to our tea know to stir the cup of tea after adding milk to speed up the mixing of milk and tea. More or less this is the same phenomenon as what is described in eq. [\ref=eq:ivp]. After all, on it's own the milk would eventually diffuse through the cup of tea. However, we may greatly decrease the time to acheive diffusion by stirring, which essentially adds a convective term to the diffusion equation for the density of tea. This convection on it's own, in an imaginary liquid with no dissipation, would only set the milk and tea in ever circulating motion - it is "conservative"! Together the dissipative and conservative motions combine into a flow which mixes much faster.

In recent years the mathematical analysis of hypocoercivity and related problems has been the subject of much research. Constantin, Kiselev, Ryzhik and Zlato [\cite=CKRZ] have analyzed the phenomenon from an abstract functional analytic perspective summarized in the following theorem:

Let H0 be a self-adjoint, positive, unbounded operator with discrete spectrum and let F be self-adjoint and satisfy with constants C and B(t) independent of ψ and [formula]. Then for any γ  >  0 the operator [formula] generates a contractive semi-group and the following are equivalent

For any t  >  0

[formula]

The operator F has no eigenvectors in Q(H0)  =   form domain of H0.

Using Thm. [\ref=thm:CKRZ] we may easily prove Thm. [\ref=thm:divergence]. Note that any normalized eigenvector ψ satisfies with λ the corresponding eigenvalue. It follows that all eigenvalues satisfy

[formula]

Thus [\eqref=eq:hypocoercive] implies that [formula]. This result applies in the present context, with the operator H0  =    -  ∂2x  +  x2 and F  =  f(x). The form domain of H0 is the space

[formula]

An eigenvector of F is a function supported on a level set of f. Thus [formula] as γ  →    ∞   if and only if the level sets of f support no (non-trivial) H1 eigenfunctions. Since [formula] Theorem [\ref=thm:divergence] follows.

However, [\eqref=eq:eigbound] and [\eqref=eq:hypocoercive] do not provide quantitative information on the rate of divergence. To find this we must estimate, for finite γ, the location of the eigenvalues. Before proceeding, it is instructive to ask, in general, "how do we estimate the location of spectrum?" When one is available, a variational principle relating eigenvalues to extrema of a quadratic form is one of the most effective tools. For example, consider the self-adjoint eigenvalue problem

[formula]

with real valued V that diverges to +    ∞   as x  →    ±    ∞  . The smallest [formula] such that a solution [formula] may be found is called the ground state eigenvalue and satisfies a variational principle

[formula]

Furthermore a minimizing wave function ψ satisfies the eigenvalue equation [\eqref=eq:basiceigprob]. The min-max principle generalizes this to higher eigenvalues.

It would be hard to overstate the utility of [\eqref=eq:basicvarprinc]. To find an upper bound on λ0 we just compute the energy [formula] of any normalized function [formula]. To find a good upper bound we "simply" make a suitably clever choice of ψ. Finding a lower bound is often more involved, requiring a uniform estimate from below on E(ψ), but even that is often possible, particularly in an asymptotic limit (see, e.g., Simon's paper on semiclassical analysis [\cite=Simon]). In way of contrast, an exact analysis of the eigenvalue problem [\eqref=eq:basiceigprob] is possible only for a few explicitly solvable examples.

However, for the operators Lγ considered here —  which are not self-adjoint —   a direct variational approach provides little insight. It remains true that any eigenvalue λ satisfies

[formula]

since [formula] with ψλ the corresponding normalized eigenfunction. However, the infimum on the r.h.s. is insensitive to the imaginary term [formula] in the operator, and thus is independent of γ. So all we learn is that

[formula]

using the well known explicit diagonalization of L0  =    -  ∂2x  +  x2.

The cornerstone of the variational approach is a relation between numerical range and spectrum valid only for normal operators. The numerical range of a linear operator L on a Hilbert space H refers to the set If L is normal then we have

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the "closed convex hull" and [formula] denotes topological closure. This may be seen using the spectral theorem, since it is elementary for multiplication operators on L2 spaces. In particular, one has the following variational principle for normal operators: extreme points of the closed numerical range are in the spectrum.

For a general closed operator L we do not have [\eqref=eq:normalspectrum=range]. However, since the point spectrum of an operator L clearly falls in [formula] we have

[formula]

whenever L has compact resolvent -- as do the operators Lγ considered here. In fact, since [formula] is convex [\cite=Kato], we have

[formula]

for L with compact resolvent. However, there does not appear to be a relation between spectrum and numerical range valid for all operators L with compact resolvent beyond the inclusion [\eqref=eq:spectruminrange]. Furthermore one knows from examples that the spectrum may lie arbitrarily far from the extreme points of the numerical range. For example, the numerical range of a 2  ×  2 matrix is an ellipse with foci at the eigenvalues, but the radii of the ellipse may be arbitrarily large.

One quite natural idea is to exploit the invariance of σ(L) under the map L  ↦  T- 1LT where T is bounded with bounded inverse. This map fixes the numerical range only if T is unitary, so we may gain something by this procedure. Indeed, if we were lucky enough to find T so that T- 1LT were normal, we would have a variational principle for the eigenvalues of L using the quadratic form [formula]. Even if T- 1LT is not normal, we may hope to use T to bring the extreme points of the numerical range closer to the spectrum of L. In finite dimension, this procedure will work, in principle, for any L. Indeed, if [formula] then

[formula]

In fact, using the Jordan canonical form one can show a bit more: for any ε  >  0 there is Tε∈(H) such that [formula] is contained in the ε neighborhood of [formula]. It is not clear if [\eqref=eq:extendedvarprinc] holds for general L with compact resolvent when [formula]. Anyway the answer to this question may not be so relevant, as in practice it is rather difficult to produce an effective conjugating operator without already knowing the Jordan form of L.

So how do we locate the spectrum of Lγ? Let us first consider an heuristic approach, that is very close in spirit to the rigorous method applied below. Let λ be an eigenvalue, Lγψ  =  λψ, with eigenfunction ψ. Suppose that ψ has a holomorphic extension ψ(z) for [formula]. By rotating the contour on which we evaluate the eigenfunction equation we find that

[formula]

where [formula] for some θ  <  β. (We have extended |x|κ to the holomorphic function [formula], single valued on Cβ with a branch singularity at 0 provided β is not too large.) Assuming the complex rotated function φ is square integrable, we discover that λ is an eigenvalue of

[formula]

In particular, applying [\eqref=eq:nonsavarprinc] with [formula] in place of Lγ, we find [formula] where

[formula]

The operator in curly brackets is a Schrödinger operator with (real valued) potential

[formula]

If θ is sufficiently small then V(x)  >  x2 and near the origin

[formula]

Applying ideas from semi-classical analysis, as in [\cite=Simon], one concludes for large γ that the ground state of [formula] is an approximate ground state of

[formula]

whose ground state eigenvalue is seen to be proportional to γ2 / (κ + 2) by scaling.

There are two deficiencies with the above argument. First we do not know that the wave function is analytic. Second, even if ψ were analytic, there would be no a priori reason to believe that φ∈L2. A reader familiar with the technique of "complex scaling" from scattering theory for (self-adjoint) Schrödinger operators will recognize the way out. We simply ignore these problems, focusing our attention instead on the spectral analysis of the following analytic family of operators

[formula]

with [formula] a complex parameter in a strip {|θ|  <  δ} with δ sufficiently small. For real w = u, with θ = 0, we have

[formula]

However, for complex w, L(w)γ is not obtained from Lγ by conjugation, but rather by analytic continuation from the operator valued map u  ↦  L(u)γ. With this set-up, we will prove Theorem [\ref=thm:main] in two steps:

From analyticity we will show that the spectrum of L(w)γ is independent of w as w varies in the strip [formula]

Using semi-classical analysis of [formula] for θ  ≠  0 we will obtain an effective estimate on the real part of the lowest eigenvalue.

Proof

For each α > 0 let [formula] The first step of the argument is to show that [formula] is a compact operator valued analytic map on a strip Sακ.

Let

[formula]

For each w∈Sακ the operator L(w)γ has compact resolvent and

[formula]

We will analyze L(w)γ through the associated quadratic forms

[formula]

defined on the form domain H1 (see [\eqref=eq:H1]). Our goal is to show, in the terminology of Kato [\cite=Kato], that w  ↦  Q(w)γ is a holomorphic family of type (a), which is to say

w  ↦  Q(w)γ(ψ) is a holomorphic map for each ψ∈H1, and

for fixed w the form Q(w)γ(  ·  ) is sectorial and closed on H1.

Once we have shown (1) and (2), it follows by definition that L(w)γ is a "holomorphic family of type (B)" and thus, by Theorem 4.3 of [\cite=Kato] that L(w)γ either has compact resolvent for all w or for no w. Since Lγ = L(0)γ has compact resolvent it follows that L(w)γ has compact resolvent for all w.

Take (1) and (2) for granted for the moment. Then w  ↦  L(w)γ is a holomorphic family with compact resolvent. By [\cite=Kato], we have the further dichotomy that [formula] is an eigenvalue of L(w)γ either for w in a discrete set or for all w∈Sαk. We may rule out the possibility of a discrete set by noting that

[formula]

where Tu is the unitary dilation operator [\eqref=eq:dilateL0]. That is, the family [formula] is related by unitary conjugations and is thus isospectral. Thus L(w)γ is isospectral as claimed and the lemma is proved once we verify (1) and (2).

Turning now to (1) and (2), note that (1) follows easily from the explicit expression for Q(w)γ. (Since [formula] on Sακ the integrand in the third term on the right hand side of [\eqref=eq:forms] cannot develop a singularity.) To prove (2), namely sectoriality, note that where the dilation Tu clearly maps H1 onto H1. Thus [formula] is closed and sectorial if and only if [formula] is closed and sectorial.

To show that [formula] is closed and sectorial, note that

[formula]

Thus, since cos (κθ) > 0 for |θ|  <  ακ, we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

Now

[formula]

Thus, by [\eqref=eq:ulbounds],

[formula]

which is to say [formula] is sectorial. Furthermore, since Q0 is a closed form with domain H1 it follows from [\eqref=eq:ulbounds] that [formula] and hence [formula] is closed on H1.

Analysis of [formula]

Since Lγ and [formula] are isospectral, if λ is an eigenvalue of Lγ then where Hγ(θ) is the real part of [formula]. That is, Note that Hγ(θ) = H-  γ( - θ). Hence without loss of generality we may take γ > 0. For the rest of the proof, let us fix some θ∈(0,ακ). Theorem [\ref=thm:main] will follow once we show that the ground state eigenvalue λ0  =  λ0(θ) of Hγ(θ) satisfies an estimate

[formula]

(In the end one could try to optimize over the choice of θ, however this would affect only the proportionally constant not the rate of divergence of the eigenvalue.)

The Schrödinger operator Hγ(θ) is of the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

Thus V(x) has a global minimum at x = 0, with

[formula]

Eq. [\eqref=eq:asymptoticmain] follows if we can show that the ground state eigenvalue of Hγ(θ) is asymptotic to the ground state eigenvalue of the anharmonic oscillator

[formula]

with [formula]. Indeed, scaling shows that the ground state of Kα satisfies [formula].

Let Φ be a fixed C2 "cut-off" function, with

[formula] for all x,

Φ(x) = 1 for |x|  ≤  1,

Φ(x) = 0 for |x|  ≥  2.

Fix ν  >  0, to be chosen below, and let

[formula]

Define [formula] so that [formula], that is [formula]. By the IMS localization formula (see [\cite=CFKS]),

[formula]

We will estimate each of the four operators on the right hand side of [\eqref=eq:IMS] separately. To estimate [formula], we simply drop the kinetic term -  ∂2x, to obtain To minimize [formula] over y  >  α-  κν we must compare

[formula]

with the value of g at the stationary points, which solve

[formula]

There are two solutions to this equation, y1  ~  1 and [formula] as α  →    ∞  . Evaluating g at these points we obtain

[formula]

Thus, provided we take [formula], we conclude that

[formula]

as α  →    ∞  .

To estimate JHγ(θ)J we compare to the anharmonic oscillator [\eqref=eq:anharmonic]:

[formula]

as α  →    ∞  . Putting this together with the estimate for [formula] and the estimate [formula], we see that

[formula]

since [formula]. To minimize the growth of the error term (in brackets), let us choose ν so that the two terms are of equal magnitude, namely [formula], yielding

[formula]

and completing the proof.
