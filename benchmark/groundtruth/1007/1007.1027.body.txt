Lacunary Fourier series and a qualitative uncertainty principle for compact Lie groups

Introduction

A set [formula] is called Q-thin if it is contained in [formula] or [formula] and if

[formula]

The set A is called lacunary (in the sense of Hadamard) if, either A is empty or there are [formula] and Q  >  1 such that [formula] are Q-thin. Then the following result is well known .

Let A be a finite union of lacunary sets and [formula] be such that {m: ~ ĝ(m)  ≠  0}  ⊂  A, then g vanishes identically provided g vanishes on a set of positive measure.

This can be proved using the fact that finite union of lacunary sets is sparse. See [\cite=HJ], page 109-110. See also [\cite=Z], Chapter V, Theorem 6.13.

Our aim in this paper is to define lacunarity on a compact connected semisimple Lie group G, using the canonical parametrization of irreducible unitary representations of G. Using our definition, we prove that, if f∈L1(G) has lacunary Fourier series and f vanishes on a non empty open subset of G, then f vanishes identically. Before we state and prove our main result, let us recall some facts.

Let G be a compact connected semisimple Lie group and T a maximal torus of G. The Lie algebras of G and T will be denoted by [formula] and [formula] respectively. Let [formula] and [formula] denote the complexifications of [formula] and [formula] respectively.

We now describe the Weyl character formula for G which will be needed later. For any unexplained terminology we refer to [\cite=V].

Let G be a compact connected semisimple Lie group and let R+ be a positive system of roots. Then the irreducible characters of G are in one-one correspondence with the positive characters of T (whose derivatives satisfy conditions (I) and (II) listed below). If χ is one such character of T, the corresponding irreducible character Θχ of G (restricted to T) is given by

[formula]

where [formula]

See [\cite=V], page 40. Here ρ is the half sum of positive roots and ξwρ  =  w. ~ ξρ where ξρ(H)  =  eρ(H) and w.χ is the action of the Weyl group on the characters χ of T. Notice that, Δ+(t) ~ Θχ(t) is a finite Fourier series on T.

The unitary dual of G, denoted by Ĝ, is described by the theorem of highest weight and is parameterized by a certain lattice in [formula] If [formula] then λ is a highest weight and gives rise to a unitary irreducible representation of G if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied:

I) Positivity and integrality conditions: [formula] for all α∈R+, the set of positive roots,

II) λ arises from a character of T, i.e. λ restricted to [formula] is the derivative of a character on T.

It follows that Ĝ can be identified with a subset of a (full) lattice contained in the dual of T. For more on compact semsimiple Lie groups we refer to [\cite=K] and [\cite=V].

Next, we define lacunary Fourier series on G. Let f be an L1 function on G and π(f) denote the Fourier transform of f defined by

[formula]

where π is an irreducible unitary representation of G. As mentioned earlier Ĝ may be identified with a subset of a lattice in the dual of the maximal torus T. This is done as follows: We identify the lattice generated by the elements in [formula] satisfying (I) and (II) above with a subset of the lattice [formula] where k  =   ~ T. We say that, f∈L1(G) has lacunary Fourier series if the set E  =  {π: ~ π(f)  ≠  0} (considered as the lattice defined earlier) satisfies the following:

[formula]

where each [formula] is a finite union of lacunary sets. We emphasize that our definition of lacunarity differs from that of Helgason (see [\cite=H]).

Proof of the main result

In this section we prove the main result. We start with the following lemma.

Let [formula] and [formula] where each [formula] is a finite union of lacunary sets. If g vanishes on a non empty open subset of [formula] then g vanishes identically.

This follows from Theorem [\ref=the0] and induction on k.

Now we are in a position to state and prove the main result of this paper.

Suppose f∈L1(G) has lacunary Fourier series. If f vanishes on a non empty open subset of G, then [formula]

Let [formula] correspond to {π∈Ĝ:π(f)  ≠  0}. Notice that if f has lacunary Fourier series then so do the translates of f. Hence, without loss of generality we may assume that f vanishes in a neighborhood of the identity in G. Convolving f with smooth approximate identities supported in small neighborhoods of the identity of G, we may assume that f is continuous, indeed smooth.

Now, consider the function Ff defined as

[formula]

Since one can choose a metric on G which is biinvariant, it is clear that Ff vanishes in a small enough neighborhood of identity in G. Also, Ff is a central function and so is determined by its restriction (still denoted by Ff) to the maximal torus T. A simple computation using Schur's orthogonality relations shows that

[formula]

where t∈T and Θπ is the character of π defined by Θπ(x)  =  (π(x)). By Weyl's character formula we get,

[formula]

where the positive character χπ of T corresponds to π∈Ĝ. Notice that, the set of nonzero Fourier coefficients of Δ+(t) ~ Ff(t) is contained in [formula] which satisfies ([\ref=eqn1]). Since Ff vanishes on an open set, by Lemma [\ref=lem1], Ff vanishes identically. It follows that (π(f)) is zero for π∈Ĝ.

Next, notice that any translate of f has lacunary Fourier series. If g varies in a small enough neighborhood of the identity in G, then applying the above argument to the translated function gf(x)  =  f(gx) we obtain that (π(g- 1)π(f)) is zero for all g in a small neighborhood and all π∈Ĝ. For each π, g  →  (π(g- 1)π(f)) is a real analytic function and hence it follows that (π(g- 1)π(f)) is identically zero for each π. This clearly implies that f is zero, by the inversion formula.

Remark I:  Although we have assumed semisimplicity, we can modify the proof so that the theorem holds for all compact connected Lie groups.

Remark II: If G  =  U(n), then Ĝ can be canonically identified with a subset of [formula] (see [\cite=V]). The Weyl group W is the permutation group Sn. If [formula] where each [formula] is lacunary, then it is easy to see that A satisfies ([\ref=eqn1]). (Note that U(n) is not semisimple.)

Remark III: Ideally one would like to get the exact analogue of Theorem [\ref=the0], but the averaging method used here to convert the problem to one on the torus works only if we assume that the set on which f vanishes is open. If f vanishes on a set of positive measure, then Ff considered as a function on [formula] need not necessarily vanish on a set of positive measure on [formula] However, if f vanishes on a neighborhood of the identity in G, then Ff considered as a function on [formula] vanishes on a neighborhood of the identity in [formula]

Uncertainty principles

To quote G. B. Folland, " the uncertainty principle is a meta theorem in harmonic analysis that can be summarized as follows: A non zero function and its Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized." For more on uncertainty principles on compact groups we refer to [\cite=PS] and [\cite=GK] and for uncertainty principles in general to [\cite=FS].

A function on [formula] can be thought of as localized, if it is supported on a lacunary set. The opposite of a localized function is a spread out function. A function whose closed support is all of G can be thought of as a highly spread out function. Thus Theorem [\ref=the1] says that if the Fourier transform of a function on G is localized, then the function itself has to be necessarily spread out--thus illustrating the uncertainty principle in the context of compact groups.
