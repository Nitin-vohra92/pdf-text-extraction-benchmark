Radio numbers for generalized prism graphs

Introduction

Radio labeling is a graph labeling problem, suggested by Chartrand, et al [\cite=CEHZ], that is analogous to assigning frequencies to FM channel stations so as to avoid signal interference. Radio stations that are close geographically must have frequencies that are very different, while radio stations with large geographical separation may have similar frequencies. Radio labeling for a number of families of graphs has been studied, for example see [\cite=hypercube] [\cite=m-ary_trees] [\cite=trees] [\cite=DaphneSquare] [\cite=square_paths] [\cite=multilevel] [\cite=cycles]. A survey of known results about radio labeling can be found in [\cite=survey]. In this paper we determine the radio number of certain generalized prism graphs.

All graphs we consider are simple and connected. We denote by V(G) the vertices of G. We use dG(u,v) for the length of the shortest path in G between u and v. The diameter of G, [formula], is the maximum distance in G. A radio labeling of G is a function cG that assigns to each vertex u∈V(G) a positive integer cG(u) such that any two distinct vertices u and v of G satisfy the radio condition:

[formula]

The span of a radio labeling is the maximum value of cG. Whenever G is clear from context, we simply write c(u) and d(u,v). The radio number of G, rn(G), is the minimum span over all possible radio labelings of G.

In this paper we determine the radio number of a family of graphs that consist of two n-cycles together with some edges connecting vertices from different cycles. The motivating example for this family of graphs is the prism graph, Zn,1, which is the Cartesian product of P2, the path on 2 vertices, and Cn, the cycle on n vertices. In other words, a prism graph consists of 2 n-cycles with vertices labeled [formula] and [formula] respectively together with all edges between pairs of vertices of the form (1,i) and (2,i). Generalized prism graphs, denoted Zn,s have the same vertex set as prism graphs but have additional edges. In particular, vertex (1,i) is also adjacent to (2,i + σ) for each σ in [formula], see Definition [\ref=def:gpg].

Main Theorem:

φ(n,s):

In addition, rn(Z3,3) = 6 and rn(Z4,3) = 9.

Preliminaries

We will use pair notation to identify the vertices of the graphs with the first coordinate identifying the cycle, 1 or 2, and the second coordinate identifying the position of the vertex within the cycle, 1,...,n. To avoid complicated notation, identifying a vertex as (i,j) will always imply that the first coordinate is taken modulo 2 with i∈{1,2} and the second coordinate is taken modulo n with j∈{1,...,n}.

In this notation, the prism graphs [formula] are Zn,1. We note that Zn,2 graphs are isomorphic to the squares of even cycles, C22n, whose radio number is determined in [\cite=DaphneSquare]. The graphs Z8,1, Z8,2, and Z8,3 are illustrated in Figure [\ref=fig:3graphpic].

Our general approach to determining the radio number of Zn,s consists of two steps. We first establish a lower bound for the radio number. Suppose c is a radio labeling of the vertices of Zn,s. We can rename the vertices of Zn,s with {αi  |  i = 1,...,2n}, so that c(αi) < c(αj) whenever i < j. We determine the minimum label difference between c(αi) and c(αi + 2), denoted φ(n,s), and use it to establish that rn(Zn,s)  ≥  2 + (n - 1)φ(n,s). We then demonstrate an algorithm that establishes that this lower bound is in fact the radio number of the graph. We do this by defining a position function p:V(G)  →  {αi  |  i = 1,...,2n} and a labeling function c:{αi}  →  Z+ that has span (n - 1)φ(n,s) + 2. We prove that p is a bijection, i.e., every vertex is labeled exactly once, and that all pairs of vertices together with the labeling [formula] satisfy the radio condition.

Some small cases of generalized prism graphs with s = 3 do not follow the general pattern, so we discuss these first. First note that Z3,3 has diameter 1 and thus can be radio-labeled using consecutive integers, i.e., rn(Z3,3) = 6. To determine rn(Z4,3), note that the diameter of Z4,3 is 2. Therefore the radio number of Z4,3 is the same as the L(2,1)-number of the graph as defined in [\cite=L21]. This prism graph is isomorphic to the join of two copies of [formula] where [formula] is the disconnected graph with two components each with 2 vertices and one edge. By [\cite=L21], it follows that rn(Z4,3) = 9. (We thank the referee for pointing out this proof.)

To simplify many of the computations that follow, we make use of the existence of certain special cycles in the graphs.

We note that H is a tight cycle if and only if H is v-tight for every v∈V(H).

Particular v-tight cycles of maximum length play an important role in our proofs. Figure [\ref=fig:3graphpic] uses bold edges to indicate a particular (1,1)-tight cycle of maximum length for each of the three types of graphs. The figure illustrates these cycles in the particular case when n = 8 but it is easy to generalize the construction to any n. We will call these particular maximum-length (1,1)-tight cycles in Zn,s standard. Thus each generalized prism graph with 1  ≤  s  ≤  3 has a standard cycle. For convenience, we will use a second set of names for the vertices of a standard cycle when focusing on properties of, or distance within, the standard cycles. The vertices of a standard cycle for Zn,s will be labeled Xsi, i = 1,..,n + 3 - s, where

[formula]

and for k = 2,3,

[formula]

These labels are illustrated in Figure [\ref=fig:3graphpic].

Lower Bound

Suppose c is a radio labeling of G with minimum span. Intuitively, building such a labeling requires one to find groups of vertices that are pairwise far from each other so they may be assigned labels that have small pairwise differences. The following lemma will be used to determine the maximal pairwise distance in a group of 3 vertices in Zn,s. This leads to Lemma [\ref=lem:phifunct], in which we determine the minimum difference between the largest and smallest label in any group of 3 vertex labels.

Let {u,v,w} be any subset of size 3 of V(Zn,s), 1  ≤  s  ≤  3, with the exception of {(1,j),(2,j),(i,l)} in V(Zn,3). Then d(u,v) + d(v,w) + d(u,w)  ≤  n + 3 - s.

Note that if u,v, and w lie on a cycle of length t, then d(u,w) + d(v,u) + d(w,u)  ≤  t. If u,v, and w lie on the same principal n-cycle, the desired result follows immediately, as all three vertices lie on a cycle of length n, and 1  ≤  s  ≤  3.

Suppose u, v, and w do not all lie on the same principal n-cycle. Without loss of generality, assume u = (1,1), and v and w lie on the second principal n-cycle. Then for s = 12, the standard cycle includes (1,1) and all vertices (2,i), so v and w lie on the standard cycle. For s = 3, the standard cycle includes all vertices (2,i), i > 1. As the triple {(1,j),(2,j),(i,l)} in V(Zn,3) was eliminated in the hypothesis, it follows that for s  ≤  3 all three vertices lie on the appropriate standard cycle. As the standard cycle in each case is of length n - s + 3, the result follows as above.

Let c be a radio labeling of Zn,s, 1  ≤  s  ≤  3 and n = 4k + r, where k  ≥  1, r = 0,1,2,3, and (n,s)  ≠  (4,3). Suppose V(G) = {αi  |  i = 1,...,2n} and c(αi) < c(αj) whenever i < j. Then we have |c(αi + 2) - c(αi)|  ≥  φ(n,s), where the values of φ(n,s) are given in the following table.

φ(n,s):

First assume {αi,αi + 1,αi + 2} are any three vertices in any generalized prism graph with 1  ≤  s  ≤  3 except {(1,j),(2,j),(i,l)} in V(Zn,3). Apply the radio condition to each pair in the vertex set {αi,αi + 1,αi + 2} and take the sum of the three inequalities. We obtain

[formula]

We drop the absolute value signs because c(αi)  <  c(αi + 1)  <  c(αi + 2), and use Lemma [\ref=lem:vexdis4AP] to rewrite the inequality as

[formula]

The table in the statement of the lemma has been generated by substituting the appropriate values for [formula] from Remark [\ref=rmk:radius] and simplifying. As the computations are straightforward but tedious, they are not included.

It remains to consider the case {αi,αi + 1,αi + 2}  =  {(1,j),(2,j),(i,l)} in V(Zn,3). From the radio condition, it follows that

[formula]

and so

[formula]

Thus we may conclude

[formula]

If k  ≥  2, then

[formula]

If k = 1, recall that Z4,3 is excluded in the hypothesis. It is easy to verify that for n = 5,6,7, [formula].

For every graph Zn,s with 1  ≤  s  ≤  3,

[formula]

We may assume c(α1) = 1. By Lemma [\ref=lem:phifunct], |c(αi + 2) - c(αi)|  ≥  φ(n,s), so c(α2i - 1) = c(α1 + 2(i - 1))  ≥  (i - 1)φ(n,s) + 1. Note that all generalized prism graphs have 2n vertices. As

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Upper Bound

To construct a labeling for Zn,s we will define a position function p:{αi  |  i = 1,...,2n}  →  V(Zn,s) and then a labeling function c:{αi  |  i = 1,...,2n}  →  . The composition [formula] gives an algorithm to label Zn,s, and this labeling has span equal to the lower bound found in Theorem [\ref=thm:lowerbound]. The labeling function depends only on the function φ(n,s) defined in Lemma [\ref=lem:phifunct].

Suppose f is any labeling of any graph G. If for some u,v∈V(G) the inequality |f(u) - f(v)|  ≥  (G) holds, then the radio condition is always satisfied for u and v. The next lemma uses this property to limit the number of vertex pairs for which it must be checked that the labeling c of Definition [\ref=defin:labeling] satisfies the radio condition.

Let {αi  |  i = 1,...,2n} be the vertices of Zn,s and c be the labeling of Definition [\ref=defin:labeling]. Then whenever |l - k|  ≥  4, d(αl,αk) + |c(αl) - c(αk)|  ≥  (Zn,s) + 1.

Without loss of generality, let l > k. Since c(αk + 4)  ≤  c(αl), it follows that

[formula]

From Remark [\ref=rmk:phi] it follows that

[formula]

We will need to consider four different position functions depending on n and s. Each of these position functions together with the labeling function in Definition [\ref=defin:labeling] gives an algorithm for labeling a particular Zn,s.

Case 1: n = 4k + r, r = 1,2,3 and s  ≤  3

except n = 4k + 2 when k is even and s = 3

The idea is to find a position function which allows pairs of consecutive integers to be used as labels as often as possible. To use consecutive integers we need to find pairs of vertices in Zn,s with distance equal to the diameter. We will do this by taking advantage of the standard cycles for each value of s.

For all n  ≥  3 and [formula], [formula] where

[formula]

Without loss of generality we may assume that (1,y) = (1,1). Consider the standard cycle in Zn,s. Then (1,1) = Xs1 and [formula]. The result follows by the observation that the standard cycle in each case is isomorphic to Cn + 3 - s.

The position function for Case 1 is

[formula]

where D is as defined in Lemma [\ref=lem:diameteraway] and

[formula]

The function p1:{αj  |  j = 1,...,2n}  →  V(Zn,s) is a bijection.

Suppose p1(αa) = p1(αb) with a > b. Let [formula] and [formula]. As p1(αa) and p1(αb) have the same first coordinate, a and b have the same parity. Examining the second coordinates we can conclude that [formula] or [formula].

By Euclid's algorithm, k is co-prime to 4k + 1 and k is co-prime to 4k + 2 when k is odd. Also, k + 1 is co-prime to 4k + 2 when k is even and k + 1 is co-prime to 4k + 3 for all k. Thus in all cases gcd(n,ω) = 1. As n divides (i - j)ω, it follows that n divides (i - j). But then (i - j)  ≥  n and thus a - b  ≥  2n, so a > 2n, a contradiction.

Lemma [\ref=lem:bijection] establishes that the function [formula] assigns each vertex exactly one label. It remains to show that the labeling satisfies the radio condition. The following lemma simplifies many of the calculations needed.

In all cases considered,

φ(n,s) + ω  ≥  diam(Zn,s) + 1 and

[formula]

First, we give the values of [formula]:

In each case, [formula]:

The last table shows the values of φ(n,s) - ω with the entries corresponding to [formula] in bold.

The function [formula] defines a radio labeling on Zn,s for the values of n and s considered in Case 1.

By Lemma [\ref=lem:vexdis4AP] it is enough to check that all pairs of vertices in the set αj,..,αj + 3 satisfy the radio condition. As d(αj,αj + a) depends only on a and on the parity of j, it is enough to check all pairs of the form (α2i - 1,α2i - 1 + a) and all pairs of the form (α2i,α2i + a) for a  ≤  3 and for some i. To simplify the computations, we will check these pairs in the case when i = 1. For the convenience of the reader, we give the coordinates and the labels of the relevant vertices.

Pair (α1,α2): By Lemma [\ref=lem:diameteraway], [formula]. Thus [formula], as required.

Pairs (α1,α3) and (α2,α4): Note that α1 and α3 lie on the same principal n-cycle and this cycle is tight by Remark [\ref=rmk:principletightcycles]. Thus

[formula]

The last inequality follows by Lemma [\ref=lem:usefulfacts]. The relationship between α2 and α4 is identical.

Pair (α1,α4): Note that

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

where the last inequality follows by Lemma [\ref=lem:usefulfacts].

Pair (α2,α3): By subtracting ω from the second coordinate, we see [formula].

When considered in the standard cycle, these vertices correspond to X11 and X12 + D - ω if s = 1 and to Xk1 and Xs1 + D - ω if s = 2 or 3. As by Remark [\ref=rmk:standardtightcycles] the standard cycle in each case is Xs1-tight, we have

[formula]

Thus in all cases [formula], so

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem:usefulfacts], φ(n,s) - ω  ≥  1 when n - s is even and φ(n,s) - ω  ≥  2 when n - s is odd. Thus

[formula]

Pair (α2,α5): As |c(α5) - c(α2)| = 2φ(n,s) - 1 and [formula], it follows that |c(α5) - c(α2)| + d(α2,α5)  ≥  2φ(n,s), and so by Remark [\ref=rmk:phi], [formula]

This establishes that [formula] is a radio labeling of Zn,s.

Case 2: n = 4k, s = 1 or 3

In this case the position function is

[formula]

where [formula].

To simplify notation, we will also denote the value of l associated to a particular vertex v by l(v). Note that [formula].

The function p2:{αj  |  j = 1,..,2n}  →  V(Zn,s) is a bijection.

To show that p2 is a bijection, suppose that p2(αa) = p2(αb) and let [formula] and [formula]. Suppose first that a and b are even. Then

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

so [formula]. As l(b) - l(a)  ≤  k - 1, this implies that l(b) = l(a). Then we have that

[formula]

and thus (i - j)  ≥  4 or a - b  ≥  8. However, a - b  ≥  8 implies that l(b)  ≠  l(a), a contradiction. The argument when a and b are odd is similar.

Suppose then that a is even and b is odd. Then [formula] shows that l(a) and l(b) have different parity and in particular l(a) - l(b)  ≠  0. On the other hand, considering the second coordinates of p2(αa) and [formula], we deduce that [formula] or [formula]. As l(a) - l(b)  ≠  0 it follows that |l(a) - l(b)|  ≥  k, a contradiction.

The function [formula] defines a radio labeling on Z4k,1 and Z4k,3.

The inequality the function must satisfy when applied to Z4k,1 is [formula]. For Z4k,3, the corresponding inequality is [formula].

For both Z4k,1 and Z4k,3, φ(n,s) = k + 2, thus cZ4k,1(u) = cZ4k,3(u).

If u and v are in the same principal cycle, then dZn,3(u,v) = dZn,1(u,v), as principal cycles are always tight. If u and v are on different principal cycles, it is easy to verify that dZn,3(u,v) = dZn,1(u,v) - 1 by comparing the standard u-tight cycles on the two graphs. Thus we can conclude that dZn,3(u,v)  ≥  dZn,1(u,v) - 1 and so if the radio condition is satisfied by cZn,1, the corresponding radio condition is satisfied by cZn,3. We will check the radio condition assuming that s = 1.

As before, it suffices to check that the radio condition holds for all pairs of the form (α2i - 1,α2i - 1 + a) and all pairs of the form (α2i,α2i + a) for a  ≤  3. For the convenience of the reader, the relevant values of p2 and c are provided below.

Note that l(αr + a) - l(αr) = 0 or 1 whenever a  ≤  3. As s = 1, [formula]. The following table has been generated using this equation.

It is straightforward to verify that in each case, d(u,v) + |c(u) - c(v)|  ≥  2k + 2.

Case 3: n = 4k, s = 2

The position function for this case is

[formula]

where [formula]. Note that [formula].

The function p3:{αj  |  j = 1,..,2n}  →  V(Zn,s) is a bijection.

Suppose that p3(αa) = p3(αb) and let [formula] and [formula]. First suppose a and b have the same parity, say even. Then

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

so [formula]. As |l(a) - l(b)|  ≤  2k - 1, this implies that l(a) = l(b) or that l(a) = l(b) + k. In the first case it follows that

[formula]

and thus (i - j)  ≥  4 or a - b  ≥  8. However, a - b  ≥  8 implies that l(b)  ≠  l(a), a contradiction.

If l(a) = l(b) + k, it follows that

[formula]

and thus 4 divides i - j - 1. We conclude that i - j - 1 is even and thus i - j is odd. It follows that i and j have different parities. But in this case p3(αa) and p3(αb) have different first coordinates, so p3(αa)  ≠  p3(αb). The argument when a and b are odd is similar.

Suppose then that a is even and b is odd. Considering the second coordinate of p3(αa) - p3(αb) [formula] gives that [formula]. As |l(a) - l(b)|  ≤  2k - 1, we again conclude that l(a) = l(b) or l(a) = l(b) + k. In the first case, considering the second coordinate of p3(αa) - p3(αb) [formula], we conclude [formula], so (i - j)  ≥  2. This however implies that l(b)  ≠  l(a), a contradiction. If l(a) = l(b) + k, then, should the second coordinate of p3(αa) - p3(αb) be congruent to 0 [formula], we'd have [formula], so (i - j - 1) is even. Again this shows that p3(αa) and p3(αb) have different first coordinates, so can not be equal.

The function [formula] defines a radio labeling on Z4k,2.

As before it suffices to check all pairs of the form (α2i - 1,α2i - 1 + a) and all pairs of the form (α2i,α2i + a) for a  ≤  3. For the convenience of the reader, the values of p3 for the pairs of vertices we must check are provided below.

We will have to compute distances in Zn,2. It is easy to see that [formula] and [formula]. The distance [formula], j  ≠  j', is somewhat harder to compute. For this purpose we can use the standard cycle in Z4k,2 after appropriate renaming of the vertices. In particular, [formula]. Let [formula] [formula] and r∈{1,...,n}. Then [formula]. Note that in Zn,2, [formula] thus d(αs,αt) depends on the parities of [formula] and [formula].

The following table shows the distances and label differences of the relevant pairs computed using the methods described above.

Case 4: n = 4k + 2 when k is even and s = 3

The position function is

[formula]

where

[formula]

The function p4:{αj  |  j = 1,...,2n}  →  V(Zn,s) is a bijection.

Suppose p4(αa) = p4(αb). Let [formula] and [formula]. If a and b have the same parity, it follows that [formula], i.e., (i - j)k = (4k + 2)m for some integer m. As k is even, k = 2q for some integer q. Substituting and simplifying, we obtain the equation q(i - j) = m(4q + 1). As gcd (q,4q + 1) = 1, it follows that q|m and thus m  ≥  q, so (i - j)  ≥  4q + 1 = 2k + 1. But in this case lj  ≠  li, so the first coordinates of p4(αa) and p4(αb) are different.

If a is odd and b is even, it follows that [formula]. So [formula]. As k is even by hypothesis, 1 + k(j - i + 2) is odd, but 4k + 2 is even, a contradiction.

The function [formula] defines a valid radio labeling on Z4k + 2,3 when k is even.

Since diam(Z4k + 2,3) = 2k + 1, we need to show that d(u,v) + |c(u) - c(v)|  ≥  2k + 2 for all pairs u,v∈Z4k + 2,3. Again it suffices to check only the pairs (α2i - 1,α2i - 1 + a) and the pairs of the form (α2i,α2i + a) for a  ≤  3. Below are given the positions and the labels of these vertices.

Note that in Zn,3, [formula] so the first coordinates of the vertices are irrelevant when computing distances. As li only appears in the first coordinates, we do not have to consider the cases of li = li + 1 and li  ≠  li + 1 separately. Below are given all the relevant distances and label differences. It is easy to verify that the condition d(u,v) + |c(u) - c(v)|  ≥  2k + 2 is satisfied for all pairs.
