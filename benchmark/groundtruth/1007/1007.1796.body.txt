Localization of Multi-Dimensional Wigner Distributions

Introduction

The Wigner quasi-probability distribution was introduced by Wigner [\cite=Wi] in 1932 in order to study quantum corrections to classical statistical mechanics. Nowadays it lies at the core of the phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics (Weyl correspondence), and has a variety of applications in statistical mechanics, quantum optics, and signal analysis, to name a few. In this note we consider the localization problem of the n-particle Wigner distribution in the 2n-dimensional phase space. We state our results precisely in Theorem 1 below.

Equip the classical phase space [formula] with coordinates (x,y) with [formula]. The Wigner quasi-probability distribution on [formula], associated with a wave function [formula] and its complex conjugate ψ*, is defined by

[formula]

The function Wψ possesses many of the properties of a phase space probability distribution (see e.g., [\cite=J]); in particular, it is real. and its marginal distributions agree with the quantum predictions, i.e.,

[formula]

where ψ̂(y) is the Fourier transform of ψ. Note that the latter property implies in particular that [formula]. However, we remark that However, Wψ is not a genuine probability distribution as it can assume negative values.

The localization problem, i.e., estimating the integral of the Wigner distribution over a subregion of the phase space, and the closely related problem of the optimal simultaneous concentration of ψ and its Fourier transform ψ̂, have received much attention in the literature both in quantum mechanics, mathematical time-frequency analysis, and signal processing (see e.g. [\cite=BDW1] [\cite=F] [\cite=G] [\cite=J] [\cite=J1] [\cite=Le] [\cite=OtM] [\cite=Pool] [\cite=Sl] [\cite=SP] [\cite=RT], and the references within). Bounds on the Lp norms were found in [\cite=Lieb]. More precisely, the problem of interest for us is:

The Wigner Distribution Localization Problem: given a measurable set [formula], find the best possible bounds to the localization function

[formula]

where the supremum is taken over all the functions [formula] with [formula].

The quantity E(D) is invariant under translations in the phase space, and under the action of the group of linear symplectic transformations (see e.g. [\cite=W]). There is no upper bound on E(D); it can be infinite. Indeed, there is a [formula] such that [formula] [\cite=J]. An example is ψ(x)  =  1 if [formula] and ψ(x)  =  0 otherwise. On the other hand, the Lp norm of Wψ is bounded [\cite=Lieb] for p  ≥  2 and we can use this information to show that E(D) is bounded by powers of the volume |D|. E.g., the L∞ norm is at most π- n, so E(D)  ≤  π- n|D|.

For certain D, however, E(D) is not only finite, it is even less than 1. In [\cite=F], Flandrin conjectured this to be true for all convex domains, and he showed that for all centered two-dimensional discs B2(r) of radius r, the standard normalized Gaussian function π- 1 / 4 exp ( - x2 / 2) is the unique maximizer of (). In particular E(B2(r))  =  1 - e- r2 (see [\cite=F], cf. [\cite=J]). It follows immediately from the definition of the Wigner distribution that Flandrin's proof can be easily generalized to higher dimensional poly-discs because the maximization problem then has a simple product structure. A less obvious case is the 2n-dimensional Euclidean ball B2n(r). The following is the generalization of Flandrin's result, and our main result:

Theorem 1. The standard normalized Gaussian π- n / 4 exp ( - x2 / 2) in [formula] is the unique maximizer of the Wigner distribution localization problem for any 2n-dimensional Euclidean ball centered at the origin. In particular,

[formula]

where [formula] is the upper incomplete gamma function.

Remarks: (1.) Owing to the translation covariance of the Wigner distribution, equation [\eqref=basic] also applies to a ball of radius r centered anywhere in [formula]. It is only necessary to multiply the Gaussian by an appropriate linear form exp (a  ·  x). Moreover, since the localization function () is invariant under the action of the group of linear symplectic transformations, Theorem 1 can also be adapted to any image of the Euclidean ball under linear symplectic maps.

(2.) Another generalization is to replace the integral over the ball with the integral over [formula], but with a weight that is a symmetric decreasing function (i.e., a radial and non-increasing function of the radius [formula]). By the "layer cake representation" [\cite=LiebLoss] the standard Gaussian again maximizes uniquely.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Flandrin's-result-in-higher-dimension]

We start with the following preliminaries. Recall that the mixed Wigner distribution of two states [formula] is defined by

[formula]

Note that in contrast to (), [formula] is not generally real, but, nevertheless, Hermitian i.e., Wψ1,ψ2  =  W*ψ2,ψ1. Moreover, it is not hard to check that the mixed Wigner distribution is sesquilinear.

Next, let [formula] be a multiindex of non-negative integers, and let [formula]. The Hermite functions Hμ(x) on [formula] are defined [\cite=Th] [\cite=W] to be the product of the normalized one-dimensional Hermite functions, i.e., [formula], where

[formula]

It is well known that the {Hμ} form a complete orthonormal system for [formula], and that

[formula]

where [formula], and [formula] is the Schrödinger operator [formula]. Here Δ denotes the standard n-dimensional Laplacian. In particular, the sesquilinearity of the Wigner distribution implies that for any [formula], one has

[formula]

The following lemma shows that the integral of the off-diagonal elements of () over any centered ball B2n(r) vanishes (cf. [\cite=J1] Section 2.3).

Let μ,ν be two multi-indices with μ  ≠  ν. Then, for every [formula], one has

[formula]

It is well known (see e.g. [\cite=Le]) that for the one-dimensional Hermite functions {hm}, one has:

[formula]

Here z1 = x1 + iy1, and Lαn are the Laguerre polynomials defined by

[formula]

for j  ≥  0 and α  >   - 1. Hence the lemma holds in the 2-dimensional case, i.e., when n = 1, because the integral of zj or [formula] over any circle centered at the origin equals zero when j  ≠  0. The higher-dimensional case follows for the same reason from (), the fact that the Wigner distribution function WHμ,Hν(x,y) is the product of Whmj,hnj(xj,yj), and the rotation invariance of the ball B2n(r).

An immediate corollary of Lemma [\ref=lemma-regarding-the-off-diagonal-elements], definition (), and equality () is

In the notation above,

[formula]

where the supremum is taken over all multi-indices [formula] of non-negative integers.

The following lemma is the main ingredient in the proof of Theorem [\ref=Flandrin's-result-in-higher-dimension].

For any integer λ  ≥  0 and multi-indices μ1, μ2 with λ  =  |μ1| = |μ2|, one has

[formula]

Postponing the proof of Lemma [\ref=main-lemma], we first conclude the proof of Theorem [\ref=Flandrin's-result-in-higher-dimension].

It follows from Corollary [\ref=Cor1] and Lemma [\ref=main-lemma] above that

[formula]

where [formula], and λ is a non-negative integer. Moreover, from () and the definition of the Wigner distribution it follow that:

[formula]

where Lλ(z) are the α = 0 Laguerre polynomials (). Setting zj  =  xj  +  iyj, we conclude that

[formula]

On the other hand, from Flandrin's result in the 1-dimensional case [\cite=F], it follows that

[formula]

for every radius [formula]. An examination of Flandrin's proof reveals that the inequality is strict for λ > 0. Hence, for every non-negative integer λ one has

[formula]

with equality only for λ = 0. The proof of Theorem [\ref=Flandrin's-result-in-higher-dimension] now follows from () and ().

Remark: The integral in ([\ref=ball]) is not monotone in λ or in r (except for λ  =  0), as might have been thought. See [\cite=BDW1] and [\cite=F] for interesting graphs of these integrals as a function of r.

For the proof of Lemma [\ref=main-lemma] we shall need the following preliminaries. For a non-negative integer λ denote

[formula]

It follows from () above that the space Hλ consists of the eigenfunctions of the rotation invariant Schrödinger operator [formula] with eigenvalue λ. In particular, it is a finite-dimensional, O(n)-invariant subspace of [formula] with orthonormal basis {Hμ  :|μ| = λ}. It follows that for every R∈O(n), and every [formula] with [formula], one has:

[formula]

where the coefficients [formula] satisfy [formula].

We note the following useful fact: In order to identify which coefficients [formula] are non-zero, it is only necessary to check the leading powers on the two sides of ([\ref=rotation]). That is, the left side of ([\ref=rotation]) defines a polynomial of degree λ in the indeterminates [formula]. The highest degree terms are the monomials [formula] with [formula], but there are also monomials of degree lower than λ. In order to show that a given Hν appears with a non-zero coefficient in the decomposition ([\ref=rotation]), it is only necessary to show that there is a highest degree monomial [formula] in the decomposition. It is not necessary to check the lower degree monomials; they will appear automatically because we know that the decomposition contains only Hermite functions of degree λ and no others.

Fix a non-negative integer λ, and [formula]. We consider the maximum problem

[formula]

and denote by [formula] one of its maximizers.

From the sesquilinearity property of the Wigner distribution and Lemma [\ref=lemma-regarding-the-off-diagonal-elements], we conclude that for every R∈O(n) one has:

[formula]

Since [formula] is a maximizer, this implies that for any ν0 with [formula] one has

[formula]

i.e., Hν0 is also a maximizer. The lemma will be proved if we can show that, starting from any [formula], we can, by a succession of rotations and intermediate indices, finally reach any given ν.

The proof will proceed in two steps. The first is to go from [formula], by a succession of two-dimensional rotations, to [formula] with [formula].

First, we show that there is a rotation R'∈O(n) with

[formula]

Thus, [formula] is also a maximizer. In a similar fashion, we can go from [formula] to [formula], where [formula]. Proceeding inductively, we finally arrive at the conclusion that [formula] is a maximizer.

A rotation R' that accomplishes the first step to [formula] is simply [formula] for j > 2. The monomial [formula] becomes [formula] and this obviously contains the monomial [formula] with a non-zero coefficient.

The second step is to go in the other direction, from [formula] to [formula] when [formula]. As before, we do this with a sequence of two-dimensional rotations, the first of which takes us from [formula] to [formula]. From thence we go to [formula], and so forth. This can be accomplished with the same rotation as before, namely [formula] for j > 2.

We argue by induction: the product [formula] is an eigenfunction of the 2-dimensional Schrödinger operator. Hence, for any 2-dimensional rotation R'θ with angle θ in the {x1,x2}-plane, one has

[formula]

for some coefficients αj depending on [formula],[formula], and R'θ. It is not hard to check (by comparing the higher order terms on both sides) that for θ  =  π / 4 one has α0  ≠  0. Continue by induction (i.e, taking a rotation with angle π / 4 in the {x1,x3}-plane) we obtain () and in particular () for ν0  =  νλ, i.e., Hνλ is a maximizer.

Next, we consider an arbitrary multi-index [formula] with [formula]. Using again the fact that the space Hλ is O(n)-invariant, we obtain that for any rotation R∈O(n):

[formula]

where the coefficients cν(νλ,R) satisfy [formula]. Arguing as above, this implies in particular that for any ν0 with cν0(νλ,R)  ≠  0 one has

[formula]

Similarly to the previous step, we shall show that there is a rotation R''∈O(n) for which

[formula]

As before, we argue by induction: the function hνλ(x1) = hνλ(x1)  h0(x2) is an eigenfunction of the 2-dimensional Schrödinger operator. Hence, for any 2-dimensional rotation R''θ with angle θ in the {x1,x2}-plane, one has

[formula]

for some coefficients αj depending on λ, and R''θ. It is not hard to check (by comparing the higher order terms on both sides) that for θ  =  π / 4 one has [formula]. Continue by induction (i.e, taking a rotation with angle π / 4 in the {x2,x3}-plane) we obtain () and in particular () for [formula].

Thus, we conclude that for any multuindex μ with |μ|  =  λ, and any [formula], one has

[formula]

This completes the proof of the lemma.
