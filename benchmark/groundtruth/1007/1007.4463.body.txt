On Kazhdan constants of finite index subgroups in [formula]

Abstract. We prove that for any finite index subgroup Γ in [formula], there exists [formula], ε  =  ε(Γ) > 0, and an infinite family of finite index subgroups in Γ with a Kazhdan constant greater than ε with respect to a generating set of order k. On the other hand, we prove that for any finite index subgroup Γ of [formula], and for any ε > 0 and [formula], there exists a finite index subgroup Γ'  ≤  Γ such that the Kazhdan constant of any finite index subgroup in Γ' is less than ε, with respect to any generating set of order k. In addition, we prove that the Kazhdan constant of the principal congruence subgroup Γn(m), with respect to a generating set consisting of elementary matrices (and their conjugates), is greater than [formula], where c > 0 depends only on n. For a fixed n, this bound is asymptotically best possible.

Introduction.

We begin by recalling the definition of Kazhdan property (T) and Kazhdan constants, first introduced by Kazhdan [\cite=Kaz].

Let Γ be a finitely generated discrete group, and let S  ⊂  Γ. Let (π,H) be a unitary representation of Γ without a non-zero invariant vectors and let ε > 0. A vector 0  ≠  v∈H is called (S,ε)-invariant, if for any s∈S we have [formula]. Let κ(Γ,S,H) denote the largest number ε  ≥  0 such that [formula] for every v∈H. The Kazhdan constant κ(Γ,S) is the infimum of the set {κ(Γ,S,H)} where H runs over all the unitary representation without non-zero invariant vector. We say that a group Γ has Kazhdan property (T) if there exists a finite subset S of Γ such that κ(Γ,S) > 0.

In [\cite=ShV] Sharma, and Venkataramana showed that any noncocompact irreducible lattice in a higher real semi-simple Lie group contains a subgroup of finite index which is generated by 3 elements. In an analog way, we raised the following question: For a fixed n  ≥  3, is there exist ε > 0 and [formula], such that any finite index subgroup Γ in [formula] contains a subgroup of finite index Γ'  ≤  Γ with a Kazhdan constant greater than ε with respect to some generating set of size k. The answer is no, and it follows from the following proposition.

Let Γ be a finite index subgroup in [formula]. Then for any ε > 0 and [formula], there exists a finite index subgroup Γ'  ≤  Γ, such that the Kazhdan constant of any finite index subgroup of Γ' is less than ε, with respect to any set of generators of order k.

On the other hand for a fixed finite index subgroup Γ of [formula] we prove the following:

Let n  ≥  3 and let Γ be a finite index subgroup of [formula]. Then there exists ε  =  ε(Γ) > 0, [formula] and an infinite family {Γi}∞i = 1 of finite index subgroups of Γ, such that for every i, the Kazhdan constant of Γi is greater than ε with respect to some set of generators of order k.

We remark that in our construction of the family {Γi}∞i = 1, the intersection [formula] is isomorphic to some principal congruence subgroup in [formula]. Recall that for any n  ≥  2, and for any integer m, the principal congruence subgroup of level m is defined by

[formula]

Let R be an associative ring with a unit and let i and j be distinct integers in [formula] with 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n. Denote by Xij(r) the n  ×  n matrix with 1 along the diagonal, r∈R in the (i,j) position, and zero elsewhere. Note that Xij( - r) is the inverse of Xij(r). These are the elementary matrices. Denote by ELn(R) the group which they generate. Let R' be a subring (not necessarily with a unit) of the ring R . We define

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula], set [formula] and Sn(m) = {Xij(  ±  m):1  ≤  i  ≠  j  ≤  n}. It is obvious that ELn(Rm) = 〈Sn(m)〉. In Section [\ref=sec_gen_set_gamma], we define a generating set Σn(m) for Γn(m), which contains Sn(m) and a conjugate of Sn(m) by some specific matrix [formula] where yn depends only on n. Shalom [\cite=Sh1] and Kassabov [\cite=Kas2] showed that the Kazhdan constant εn of [formula] satisfy [formula] with respect to the elementary matrices Sn(1) as a generating set. Here we study the Kazhdan constant of Γn(m) (respect. ELn(Rm)) with respect to Σn(m) (respect. Sn(m)).

Let n  ≥  3 then there exists a constant 0 < c < 1, which depends only on n, such that for any [formula] the Kazhdan constant of Γn(m) (respect. ELn(Rm)) with respect to the set of generators Σn(m) (respect. Sn(m)) is at least [formula] and at most [formula].

Thus for a fixed n, the Kazhdan constant in Theorem [\ref=thm_kaz_el] is asymptotically best possible.

The proofs of the previous theorems use the relative property (T) for the pair [formula], and the bounded generation property.

A group Γ has the bounded generation (BG) property if there exist g1,...,gυ∈Γ such that

[formula]

The value υ is called the degree of bounded generation.

Let Xn(m) be the set of all the elementary matrices in [formula] that have all off diagonal entries divisible by m. It is clear that Xn(m)  ⊂  ELn(Rm). Let [formula] where yn is an element in [formula] which we define in Section [\ref=sec_gen_set_gamma].

The first part in the following theorem is due to D. W. Morris (unpublished). With his kind permission we have included his argument in section [\ref=sec_proof_thm_bg_el].

Let n  ≥  3 then there exists a positive integer υn such that for all [formula] 1) any element in ELn(Rm) can be written as a product of at most υn matrices from Xn(m). 2) any element in Γn(m), can be written as a product of at most 2υ3 + n3 matrices from Xcn(m).

We remark that the main difficulty in proving the last theorem is the fact that the ring Rm is a commutative ring without an identity element. Notice also that the degree of the bounded generation (υn), which is given by the Compactness Theorem, does not yield any explicit bound. In Theorem [\ref=thm_kaz_el], n was fixed and m varied. Now we study the case that m is fixed and n growth to infinity. As a consequence of the the second part of Theorem [\ref=thm_bg_el_n] we obtain:

There exists a constant c > 0, such that for any [formula] and n  ≥  3

Kazhdan constants of finitely generated discrete groups

A basic question in the theory of Kazhdan's property (T) is to compute explicit Kazhdan constants with respect to some generating sets. This question was raised by Serre and by de la Harp and Valette [\cite=HV] and it is has been addressed for several discrete groups (see the section on Kazhdan constants in the introduction of [\cite=BHV]). The Kazhdan constant is important since it yields quantitative versions for many of the consequences derived from property (T), e.g. expander constant, mixing time on finite graphs and more, we refer to [\cite=BHV] [\cite=Lub] for more details and applications.

In a fascinating paper [\cite=Sh1] Shalom (generalized a result of Burger [\cite=Bur]) relates property (T) to bounded generation property; Let R be a commutative, topological unital ring R, and assume that the group SLn(R) where n  ≥  3, has the (BG) property with respect to elementary matrices, then SLn(R) has Kazhdan property (T) with explicit Kazhdan constant [\cite=Sh1]. Carter and Keller [\cite=CK] proved that SLn(O) where O is a ring of integer, has the bounded generation property if n  ≥  3.

Tavgen [\cite=Tav] proved that for n  ≥  3 the group ELn(Rm) has the bounded generation property by elementary matrices, but his bound depends on the index

About the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_uni_kaz]

Let Γ be a finite index subgroup of [formula] where n  ≥  3. From the positive solution to the congruence subgroup problem [\cite=Men1] [\cite=BLS], Γ contains Γn(m) for some [formula]. Let [formula], we show that the relative Kazhdan constant of the pair [formula] depends only on m. Now there are two natural embedding of [formula] in Γ. One is the case that Rn - 1ml is sitting in the lower row and the second is when Rn - 1ml is sitting in the last column. Let Γn(m,l) be the group generated by this two embedding. We continue by showing that there exists δn > 0 which depend only on m (and n), such that any unitary representation of Γn(m,l) with a δn-invariant vector, contains a non-zero Γn(m4l)-invariant vector. We finish by showing that any element in the quotient group Γn(m,l) / Γn(m4l) can be written as a bounded product of elementary matrices and an element from Γn - 1(m) / Γn - 1(m4l). Then by the fact the subgroup Γn - 1(m) has property (T) (or τ for n = 3), we get that the Kazhdan constant of Γn(m,l) depends only on m (and n).

Organization of the Paper.

In Section [\ref=pre_kaz] we recall several definition and useful lemmas in the theory of property (T). In Section [\ref=sec_prop_non_uni_kaz] we prove Proposition [\ref=prop_non_uni_kaz]. In Section [\ref=sec_gen_set_gamma] we define a set of generator for Γn(m), we show that Γn(m) is a bounded product of two subgroups which are isomorphic to ELn(Rm) and we prove that any element in ELn(Rm2) can be written as a bounded product of elementary matrices from ELn(Rm) and an element from Γn - 1(m). In section [\ref=sec_proof_thm_bg_el] we prove Theorem [\ref=thm_bg_el_n]. In section [\ref=sec_RT] we prove relative property (T) for the pair [formula]. In Section [\ref=sec_kaz_pri_sub] we prove Theorems [\ref=thm_kaz_el]. Finally, in Section [\ref=sec_thm_uni_kaz] we prove Theorem [\ref=thm_uni_kaz].

Preliminaries on Kazhdan's property (T)

Let Γ be a discrete group and assume that κ(Γ,S) > 0 for some finite subset, then S is a generating set of Γ (see [\cite=BHV]). In addition if Γ has property (T), then κ(Γ,S) > 0 for any finite generating set S of Γ, but the Kazhdan constant κ(Γ,S) depends on S. For the interesting question of the connection between the Kazhdan constants and the generating set see [\cite=ALW] [\cite=GZ] [\cite=Os].

One of the main tools for proving property (T) and estimating Kazhdan constants is the notation of relative property (T).

Let Γ be a discrete group generated by a finite set S and let B  ≤  Γ a subgroup. The pair (Γ,B) is said to have relative property (T) if there exists ε > 0 such that for every unitary representation (π,H) with (S,ε)-invariant vector, contain a non-zero invariant vector under the action of B. The largest ε with this property is called the relative Kazhdan constant and is denoted by κ(Γ,B;S).

It is easy to see that the relative property (T) depends only on the groups Γ and B and is independent of the generating set S (but the constant depends also on the generating set). A related useful notation is the Kazhdan ratio given by Ershov and Jaikin [\cite=EJ].

Let Γ be a discrete group and B and S subsets of Γ. The Kazhdan ratio κr(G,B;S) is the largest [formula] with the following property : If H is any unitary representation of Γ and v∈H is (S,δε)-invariant, then v is (B,ε)-invariant.

For a discussion about the connection between relative property (T) and Kazhdan ratio see section 3.1 in [\cite=EJ].

If κ(Γ,B) > 0 for some subset B of Γ and if κr(Γ,B;S) > 0 for some finite subset S, then it is easy to check that the group Γ has Kazhdan property (T) with Kazhdan constant

[formula]

The following (well known) lemmas are useful in proving Kazhdan property (T) and for estimating Kazhdan constants.

Let Γ be a group generated by a set S with κ(Γ,S)  >  ε > 0. Let 0  <  δ  <  ε be given. Let (π,H) be a unitary representation of Γ having a unit vector v∈H, satisfying [formula] Then

[formula]

For a proof, see for example [\cite=Had].

Let (π,H) be a unitary representation of a group Γ. Suppose that for some unit vector v∈H,

[formula]

Then there exist a non-zero Γ-invariant vector in H.

For a proof, we refer the reader to [\cite=HV] and [\cite=Sh1].

The following proposition give a upper bound for the Kazhdan constant of abelian groups.

([\cite=LW]) Let A be an abelian group of order n generated by k elements S, with κ(A,S) = ε. Then

[formula]

Although the proposition in [\cite=LW] state differently (with a different but equivalent definition of Kazhdan constant), it follows easily from their proof.

Proof of Proposition [\ref=prop_non_uni_kaz]

Let Γ be a finite index subgroup of [formula], and let εk be given. Then for any prime p the intersection [formula] is a subgroup of finite index in Γn(p). Now the principle congruence subgroup Γn(p) embeds into a pro-p group, therefore any finite index group in Γn(p), has a quotient isomorphic to the cyclic group Cp. So from Proposition [\ref=pr_kaz_abelian] we get that Kazhdan constant of any finite index subgroup in Γ' is less than [formula] with respect to any set of generators of order k. Therefore for large p, which depends on ε and k, the result follow.

Generating set for Γn(m) and BG for Γn(m2)

Generating set

Let 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n and Eij be the matrix with the entry 1 at the (i,j)th place and zero elsewhere. For 1  ≤  i < n, let

[formula]

e.g.

[formula]

Let A be a subset of [formula] and let [formula], we define Ag  =  {ag:a∈A}. Set Sn(m) = {Xij(m):1  ≤  i  ≠  j  ≤  n} and [formula].

Let [formula] and n  ≥  3, then the principal congruence subgroup Γn(m) in [formula] is generated by the set Σn(m) and

[formula]

The group Γn(m) / Γn(m2) is an abelian group and by direct computation, it is easy to see that any element in Γn(m) / Γn(m2) is a product of an element from the subgroup ELn(Rm) and an element from the subgroup ELn(Rm)yn. Now, since Γn(m2) is a normal subgroup of ELn(Rm) (see [\cite=Men2] [\cite=Tit]) the result follow.

Bounded generation for Γn(m2)

We start with an important known property of the ring [formula].

Let a1,...,an be non-zero integers which satisfy [formula]. If n > 2, then there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

We denote by P the set of all primes. Let d = gcd(a2,...,an - 1). Set

[formula]

If [formula], set x = 1 else let [formula], we claims that

[formula]

Indeed, let p be a prime divisor of gcd(a2,...,an - 1). We have three cases:

If p divide a1, then [formula] and since gcd(a1,...,an) = 1 we have [formula]. Hence

[formula]

If p divide an then [formula] , hence [formula].

If [formula] and [formula] then p∈A and p|x. Hence [formula].

In the language of K-theory, Lemma [\ref=lem_sr_z] shows that the stable range of [formula] is 2 (see for example [\cite=HO] for the definition of stable range).

Let n > 2, and let m,a1,...,an be non-zero integers which satisfy gcd(ma1,ma2,...,man - 1,man + 1) = 1. Then there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem_sr_z], there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

We claim that

[formula]

Indeed, let d = gcd(ma4,...,man - 1,ma2,man + 1), and let p be a prime such that p|d. It is clear that [formula]. If p|x1, then [formula] and we are done. So assume that [formula] and there are two cases to check.

If p|ma3, then from equation [\ref=eq_sr_m], we obtain [formula] and we are done.

If p|ma1, then from equation [\ref=eq_sr_m], we obtain [formula]. This imply that [formula] and we are done.

Now by repeating this argument on the sequence

[formula]

we obtain the require result.

Let n > 2 and let m,a1,...,an be non-zero integers which satisfy gcd(m2a1,...,m2an - 1,m2an + 1) = 1. Then there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=lem_sr_ind], there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem_sr_z] there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

and it is clear that [formula]. Let

[formula]

It is straightforward to check that m|d but [formula], so we can write d = mx for some integer x with [formula]. Assume that there exists a prime p such that p|x. If p|xn - 2 then [formula] and we are done. So assume that [formula], and we have two cases:

If p|m2an + 1 then from the fact that p|a2, we obtain

[formula]

and we are done.

If

[formula]

then from p|a2 we get [formula], and therefore [formula] and the result follow.

Let n  ≥  3, and [formula], then any element in Γn(m2) can be written as a bounded product of at most 3n - 2 elementary matrices in ELn(Rm) and an element from Γn - 1(m).

Let

[formula]

The matrix A is invertible, therefore (m2a1,...,m2an + 1) = 1. Without restrict the generality we can assume that a1  ≠  0 and a2  ≠  2. Using Lemma [\ref=lem_sr_ind], there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

As a consequence there are [formula] such that

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

Therefore by performing n - 1 elementary matrices from ELn(Rm), i.e.

[formula]

we get 1 in the right lower corner of B. Now by at most 2(n - 1) elementary matrices we can annihilate all the rest of the last row and the last column. So by at most 3n - 2 elementary matrices from Xn(m), we can bring A to an element C which belong to [formula], but C = Im, hence C∈Γn - 1(m).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_bg_el_n]

Proof for part (1) of theorem [\ref=thm_bg_el_n]: This proof is based on a result of Carter, Keller, and Paige [\cite=Mo] and is due to D. W. Morris (unpublished). We start by recalling several notations from [\cite=Mo].

[\cite=Mo] Let X be a subset of a group G. Let r be a any nonnegative integer, we define 〈X〉r, inductively, by:

〈X〉0 = 1,

[formula].

[\cite=Mo] Let A be a commutative ring, [formula] be an ideal in A, and n a positive integer.

[formula].

Xn() = {Xij(a):a∈,1  ≤  i  ≠  j  ≤  n}.

ELn() = 〈Xn()〉.

[formula] is the set of ELn(A)-conjugates of elements of Xn(q).

[formula]. i.e [formula] is the smallest normal subgroup of ELn(A) that contains Xn().

From [\cite=Mo], we see that if A is any commutative ring satisfying the first-order axioms [formula], [formula], and [formula] (see [\cite=Mo] for the definition of these axioms), then

[formula]

Furthermore, [\cite=Tit] (quoted without proof in [\cite=Mo]) tells us

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

so the Compactness Theorem (cf. [\cite=Mo]) implies there exists r (independent of q) such that

[formula]

So

[formula]

It is clear that the quotient 〈Xn(q)〉 / SL(n,A;q2) is an abelian group, and since Xn(q) is a union of (n - 1)2 subgroups of elementary matrices, we obtain

[formula]

Since [formula] satisfies the axioms [formula], [formula], and [formula] (see Lemma 2.13, Corollary 3.5, and Theorem 3.9 of [\cite=Mo]) with [formula], we may let [formula] and the result follows.

Proof for part (2) of theorem [\ref=thm_bg_el_n]: If n = 3 then from Proposition [\ref=pr_bg_princ] we get that any element γ∈Γ3(m) can be written as γ  =  γ1  ·  γ2, where γ1∈EL3(Rm) and γ2∈EL3(Rm)y3. Hence by part (1) of this Theorem we get that any element in Γn(m) can be written as a product at most 2υ3 matrices from Xc3(m).

If n > 3, set An  =  Γn(m) / Γn(m2). An is an abelian group which is generated by the set Σn(m). It is easy to show that every element in An can be written as a product of at most n2 - 1 matrices from Xcn(m). The set An can be regard also as a set of representatives for the cosets of Γn(m) / Γn(m2). Hence any element γn∈Γn(m), can be written as γn = anγn', for some an∈An and γn'∈Γn(m2). By Proposition [\ref=lem_bg] we get that γn' can be written as a product of at most 3n - 2 elementary matrices from Xn(m), and an element from Γn - 1(m).

We repeat this process and get that any element γn∈Γn(m) can be written as a product of at most [formula] elementary matrices in ELn(Rm) and n - 4 elements from the cosets representative An,...,A4. So any element in Γn(m) can be written by at most

[formula]

matrices from Xcn(m) and an element from Γ3(m). Now since any element in Γ3(m) can we written as a product of at most 2υ3 matrices from Xc3(m), we obtain that any element in Γn(m) can be written as a product at most 2υ3 + n3 matrices from Xcn(m).

Relative property (T) for [formula]

Burger [\cite=Bur] gave the first quantitative version of relative property (T) for the pair of groups [formula], Shalom [\cite=Sh1] extended it to the pair [formula] where R is an commutative ring with a unit, and Kassabov [\cite=Kas1] proved an analog version for the case that R is an associative ring with unit. Here we give a similar result for some commutative rings without a unit element. Our proof is based on Shalom proof [\cite=Sh1] which appear also in [\cite=BHV].

Let [formula], set

[formula]

in EL2(Rm), and let

[formula]

in [formula].

It is easy to check that the set

[formula]

is a generating set for the semidirect product [formula].

Let ν be a mean on the Borel sets of [formula]. There exists a Borel subset M of [formula] and an elementary element γ∈{U±(m),L±(m)} such that [formula] for the linear action of EL2(Rm) on [formula].

In [\cite=BHV] the above lemma is stated for the case m = 1, but it easy to check that the same proof holds for arbitrary [formula].

The abelian group R2l is isomorphic to [formula] and therefore the unitary dual of R2l will be identified with the 2-torus 2 by associating to (e2πix,e2πiy)∈2 the character (al,bl)  →  e2πi(xa + yb). The unitary dual 2 is a locally compact space and we denote by β(2) its Borel subsets. Set [formula].

The next theorem is quite standard in the theory of Kazhdan's property (T). For a proof see for example Theorem 4.2.2 in [\cite=BHV] (just replace [formula] with ε(m) and use [formula]).

Let [formula], then the pair [formula] has relative property (T) with relative Kazhdan constant

[formula]

The following proposition is analog to Corollary 4.2.3 in [\cite=BHV]. We refer the reader to their proof (just to replace [formula] by Rm and [formula] by [formula], all the rest is the same).

Let [formula], then

[formula]

In case m = l we can use the natural embedding of [formula] into ELn(Rm) where n  ≥  3 (see for example [\cite=BHV]), and conclude the following proposition (which is analog to [\cite=Kas1]):

Let n  ≥  3 and [formula], then

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_kaz_el] and Corollary [\ref=cor_kaz_gamma]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_kaz_el]: We start by proving the lower bound separately for each group. The group ELn(Rm): From Theorem [\ref=thm_bg_el_n] and Lemma [\ref=cen_mas] we get

[formula]

So by Corollary [\ref=pro_kaz_ratio_el] and inequality ([\ref=eq_kaz_ratio]) we obtain

[formula]

The group Γn(m): From Proposition [\ref=pr_bg_princ] we get that any element in the group Γn(m) can be written as a product of 2 elements from 2 subgroup which are isomorphic to ELn(Rm). Now by the previous case we have

[formula]

Hence by Lemma [\ref=lem_kaz_gp] (and Lemma [\ref=cen_mas]) and from the structure of Σn(m) we obtain

[formula]

The upper bound: It easy to check that   ⊂  Γn(m2), and it is known that Γn(m2)  ≤  ELn(Rm) (see [\cite=Tit] [\cite=Men2]). This imply that the quotient Γn(m) / Γn(m2) (respect. ELn(Rm) / Γn(m2)) is an abelian group which is isomorphic to Cn2 - 1m (respect Cn2 - nm) where Cm is the cyclic group of order m. From the structure of Σn(m) (respect Sn(m)), one can show that there exists a mapping from Γn(m) (respect ELn(Rm)) onto the cyclic group Cm where the projection of the generating set Σn(m) (respect. Sn(m)) is {  ±  1}. Now it is straightforward to check that the Kazhdan constant of the cyclic group Cm with respect to [formula] as generating set is [formula].

Proof of Corollary [\ref=cor_kaz_gamma]: From part (2) of Theorem [\ref=thm_bg_el_n] and Lemma [\ref=cen_mas], we obtains [formula]. By the structure of the generating set Σn(m) (and Proposition [\ref=pro_kaz_ratio_el]), it is straightforward to check

[formula]

Hence by equation [\ref=eq_kaz_ratio] the result follow.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_uni_kaz]

Let [formula] and n  ≥  3, set

[formula]

If n > 3 set

[formula]

where Σn - 1(m) is the set of generators of Γn - 1(m) which we defined in section [\ref=sec_gen_set_gamma]. If n = 3 let Σ2(m) be any finite set of generators for Γ2(m) which contains {X12(m),X21(m)} (Γ2(m) is of finite index in [formula], so such a generating set exists), and set

[formula]

Let Γn(m,l) be the group which is generated by βn(m,l). From a result of Tits [\cite=Men2] [\cite=Tit], it is easy to check that Γn(m,l) is a finite index subgroup of [formula].

Set

[formula]

Let g∈Xn'(ml), then there exists an injective homomorphisms

[formula]

such that g is contained in ψ(R2ml).

For a proof see Lemma [\cite=BHV]. The next proposition follow from the last Lemma and Proposition [\ref=pro_kaz_ratio_el].

Let [formula], then

[formula]

Let υn  =  υ(n) be the degree of ELn(Rm2l) (recall that υn depends only on n), and let [formula]. In the next proposition we use the following obvious observation

[formula]

Let (π,H) be a unitary representation of Γn(m,l). Assume that there exists a unit vector 0  ≠  v∈H which is (βn(m,l),δn)-invariant. Then there exists a non-zero vector in H which is invariant under the action of ELn(m2l).

From the Steinberg commutator relations we have = Xij(m2l). Hence any element in Xn(m2l) can be written as a product of at most 4 elements from Xn'(ml), and by the bounded generation property for ELn(Rm2l) we get that any element in ELn(Rm2l) can be written as a product of at most 4υn elementary matrices from Xn'(ml).

Now let (π,H) be a unitary representation of Γn(m,l). Assume that there exists a unit vector 0  ≠  v∈H which is (βn(m,l),δn)-invariant. From the above we get that for any g∈ELn(m2l) there exits g1,...,g4υn∈Xn'(ml) such that

[formula]

Hence from Proposition [\ref=pro_kaz_ratio_ga] we obtain that

[formula]

and from Lemma [\ref=cen_mas] the result follow.

Let Gn(m,l) = Γn(m,l) / Γn(m4l) and let K be the kernel of the following natural homomorphism

[formula]

Any element in Gn(m,l) / K can be written as a product of at most 2(n - 1) elementary matrices from Xn'(ml)(m2l) and an element from Γn - 1(m)(m2l).

Let A be the subgroup generated by αn(m,l)(m2l). It is easy to check that A is an abelian normal subgroup of Gn(m,l) / K and any element in A can be written as a product of at most 2(n - 1) elementary matrices from Xn'(ml)m2l. Moreover, the quotient (Gn(m,l) / K) / A is isomorphic to Γn - 1(m) / Γn - 1(m2l). Hence any element in Gn(m,l) / K can be written as a product of at most 2(n - 1) elementary matrices from Xn'(ml)(m2l) and an element from Γn - 1(m)(m2l).

Any element in K can be written by at most 3n - 2 matrices from Xn'(ml) m4l and an element from Γn - 1(m) / Γn - 1(m4l).

It is clear that K is a subgroup of Γn(m2l) / Γn(m4l). Let g∈K, by Proposition [\ref=lem_bg] we obtain that g can be written by at most 3n - 2 matrices from Xn'(ml)(m4l) and an element from Γn - 1(m)(m4l) (which is isomorphic to Γn - 1(m) / Γn - 1(m4l)).

From the last two lemmas it is straightforward to check the following:

Let g be an arbitrary element in Gn(m,l), then there exists x1,...,x5n - 4∈Xn'(ml)(m4l) and γ1,γ2∈Γn - 1(m)(m4l), such that

[formula]

In the next proposition, we denote by Ã the projection of a subset A  ⊂  Γn(m,l) modulo m4l.

Let n  ≥  3 and [formula]. then there exists μ  =  μ(n,m) > 0 such that for any [formula] we have

[formula]

From Proposition [\ref=ga_mod_bg] we get that for any element g∈Gn(m,l) there exists x1,...,x5n - 4∈Xn(ml)(m4l) and γ1,γ2∈Γn - 1(m)(m4l), such that

[formula]

In the case n = 3, by Selberg celebrated result [\cite=Se], there exists ε' > 0 (which depends on Σ̃2(m)  ⊂  3(m,l)) such that κ(Γ2(m) / Γ2(m4l),Σ̃2(m))  >  ε'. In case n > 3, from Theorem [\ref=thm_kaz_el] (2) there exists ε' > 0 such that κ(Γn - 1,Σn - 1) > ε'. Hence κ(Γn - 1(m) / Γn - 1(m4l),Σ̃n - 1) > ε'.

Let (π,H) be a unitary representation of Gn(m,l), and assume that there exists a unit vector v which is (βn(m,l),μ)-invariant where 0 < μ  <  ε' will be determined latter. Now restrict the representation π to the subgroup Γn - 1(m) / Γn - 1(m4l) and by Lemma [\ref=lem_kaz_gp] we get

[formula]

for every g∈Γn - 1(m) / Γn - 1(m4l). In addition, by Proposition [\ref=pro_kaz_ratio_ga] for any h∈Xn'(ml)(m4l) we have

[formula]

Let [formula], Hence

[formula]

So from Lemma [\ref=cen_mas] for [formula], this representation contains a non-zero invariant vector. Therefore for

[formula]

the result follow.

Let n  ≥  3 and [formula]. Then there exist ε  =  ε(n,m) > 0 such that for any [formula] we have

[formula]

Let (π,H) be a unitary representation of Γn(m,l). Assume that there exists a unit vector 0  ≠  u∈H which is (βn(m,l),ε)-invariant, where [formula] will be determined latter. Then from Proposition [\ref=prop_inv_el_m_l], there exist a non-zero invariant vector in H under the action of ELn(m2l) and in particular under the action of the normal subgroup Γn(m4l)  ≤  ELn(Rm2l) (see [\cite=Men2] [\cite=Tit]). Decompose H  =  H0  +  H1 where H0 is the invariant subspace under the action of Γn(m4l) and H1 is the orthogonal complement. Accordingly we have π  =  π0  +  π1 and we write v = v0 + v1.

If [formula], then from Proposition [\ref=prop_inv_el_m_l] we obtain that

[formula]

for some s∈βn(m,l) and we are done with [formula].

So we assume that [formula]. Since Γn(m4l) is a normal subgroup, therefore (π0,H0) is a unitary representation of Γn(m,l) which give rise to a unitary representation of the quotient Γn(m,l) / Γn(m4l) = Gn(m,l). From Proposition [\ref=pr_kaz_G_n_l] there is μ > 0 (independent of l) such that

[formula]

Therefore, [formula] is a Kazhdan constant of Γn(m,l) with respect to βn(m,l).

Now we are ready to complete the proof. Let Γ be a finite index subgroup of [formula] where n  ≥  3. From the positive solution for the congruence subgroup problem [\cite=BLS] [\cite=Men1], there exists [formula] such that Γn(m) is a (finite index) subgroup of Γ. For any [formula] the group Γ(m,ml) is a finite index subgroup of Γ. By Theorem [\ref=thm_uni_m_l] we get that the family {Γn(m,ml)}∞l = 1 has uniform Kazhdan constants with respect to the generating sets {βn(m,l)}∞l = 1.
