Orbit decomposition of Jordan matrix algebras of order three under the automorphism groups

Abstract. The orbit decomposition is given under the automorphism group on the real split Jordan algebra of all hermitian matrices of order three corresponding to any real split composition algebra, or the automorphism group on the complexification, explicitly, in terms of the cross product of H. Freudenthal and the characteristic polynomial.

0. Introduction.

Let J' be a split exceptional simple Jordan algebra over a field [formula] of characteristic not two, that is, the set of all hermitian matrices of order three whose elements are split octonions over [formula] with the Jordan product. And let G' be the automorphism group of J'. N. Jacobson [\cite=Jn1968] found that X,Y∈J' are in the same G'-orbit if and only if X,Y admit the same minimal polynomial and the same generic minimal polynomial, by imbedding a generating subalgebra with the identity element E in terms of the Jordan product into a special Jordan algebra. When [formula], the field of all real numbers, some elements of J' are not diagonalizable under the action of G'  =  F4(4), since J' admits a G'-invariant non-defnite [formula]-bilinear form such that the restriction to the subspace of all diagonal elements is positive-definite [\cite=MY2001], although every element of J' is diagonalizable under the action of a linear group E6(6) containing F4(4) on J' by [\cite=Jn1961] (cf. [\cite=Ks2002]) or under the action of the maximal compact subgroup [formula] of E6(6) on J' given by [\cite=SY1979].

This paper presents a concrete orbit decomposition under the automorphism group on a real split Jordan algebra of all hermitian matrices of order three corresponding to any real split composition algebra, or the complexification of it, that is special or exceptional as a Jordan algebra. As a result, X,Y∈J' are in the same G'-orbit if and only if X,Y admit the same dimension of the generating subspace with E by the cross product [\cite=Fh1953] and the same characteristic polynomial, which gives a simplification for N. Jacobson [\cite=Jn1968]'s polynomial invariants on G'-orbits when [formula] or the field of all complex numbers [formula]. To state the main results more precisely, let us give the precise notations:

Put [formula] or [formula]. Let V be an [formula]-linear space, and [formula] (or [formula]) denote the set of all [formula]-linear endomorphisms (resp. automorphims) on V. For a mapping f:V  →  V and [formula], put Vf,c: = {v∈V| ~ f(v) = cv} and Vf,1: = Vf. For a subgroup G of [formula], let [formula] be the identity connected component of G. For v∈V and a mapping φ:V  →  V, put OG(v): = {α(v)| ~ α∈G}, Gv: = {α∈G| ~ α(v)  =  v} and [formula]. For a subset W of V, put GW: = {α∈G| ~ {αw| ~ w∈W}  =  W}. For positive integers n,m, let M(n,m;V) be the set of all n  ×  m-matrices with entries in V. Put Vn: = M(n,1;V),Vm: = M(1,m;V) and Mn(V): = M(n,n;V). Since V can be considered as an [formula]-linear space, the complexification is defined as [formula] with an [formula]-linear conjugation: [formula] (v1,v2∈V). For any [formula], put [formula] such that [formula], which is identified with [formula]: [formula].

By W.R. Hamilton, the quaternions is defined as an [formula]-algebra [formula] given as e0ei  =  eie0  =  ei, ~ e2i  =    -  e0 (i∈{1,2,3}); ekek + 1  =    -  ek + 1ek  =  ek + 2 (where k,k + 1,k + 2∈{1,2,3} are counted modulo 3) with the unit element 1: = e0 and the conjugation [formula], which contains the complex numbers [formula] and the real numbers [formula] as [formula]-subalgebras. By A. Cayley and J.T. Graves, the octanions is defined as a non-associative [formula]-algebra [formula] given as follows [\cite=Dle1919]:

[formula]

with the [formula]-linear basis {ei| ~ i  =  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, where the numbering is given as e5: = e1e4,e6: =   -  e2e4,e7: = e3e4 after [\cite=Yi1967], [\cite=Dd1978] or [\cite=Ms1989]. Put [formula] and [formula]. For [formula], put [formula]. And put [formula] with the identification [formula]. Then [formula] is split (i.e. non-division) as a [formula]-algebra with [formula] as the complex conjugation with respect to the real form K. Put

[formula]

as [formula]-linear conjugations with respect to [formula] and [formula], respectively. And a [formula]-bilinear form are defined on [formula] as [formula]. The restrictions of γ,ε and (x|y) on [formula] are also well-defined and denoted by the same letters. Then [formula] is a composition [formula]-algebra with respect to the norm form given by N(x): = (x|x) [\cite=Dd1978], because of [formula] since [formula] is an associative composition algebra with respect to N [\cite=CS2003]. And [formula] is a division composition [formula]-algebra with the norm form N(x) such that a- 1  =  ā / N(a) for a  ≠  0.

Put [formula] as a composition [formula]-algebra with the norm form N(x) such that [formula]. Precisely, [formula] is the [formula]-algebra of the split-octanions containing the [formula]-subalgebra [formula] of the split-quaternions and the [formula]-subalgebra [formula] of the split-complex numbers such that [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] as a [formula]-subalgebra of [formula].

Put : = K,K' (or [formula], [formula]) with [formula] (resp. [formula]) and [formula]. For A∈Mn() with the (i,j)-entry aij∈, let tA,τA,εA∈Mn() be the transposed, τ-conjugate, ε-conjugate matrix of A such that the (i,j)-entry is equal to aji,τ(aij),ε(aij), respectively, with the trace [formula], and the adjoint matrix A*: =  ~ t(εA)∈Mn(). Let denote the set of all hermitian matrices of order three corresponding to [formula] as follows:

[formula]

with an [formula]-bilinear Jordan algebraic product [formula], the identity element [formula] and an [formula]-bilinear symmetric form [formula]. After H. Freudenthal [\cite=Fh1953] (cf. [\cite=Fh1951], [\cite=Yi1959], [\cite=Jn1960], [\cite=Jn1968], [\cite=Yi1975]), the cross product on J3() is defined as follows:

[formula]

with X×  2: = X  ×  X as well as an [formula]-trilinear form (X|Y|Z): = (X  ×  Y|Z) and the determinant [formula] on J3() (cf. [\cite=Fh1964]). Put [formula] for i∈{1,2,3} with the Kronecker's delta δij. For x∈, put

[formula]

For [formula] or [formula], put [formula] such as

[formula]

with M1: = M1(1), M23: = M23(1). For x∈K'  =  ',' or ', put M1'(x),M2'3(x)∈J3(K') such as

[formula]

with M1': = M1'(1), M2'3: = M2'3(1). For x∈, let denote

[formula]

And denote

[formula]

When   =  K, P2() has a structure of Moufang projective plane [\cite=Fh1964], the algebraization method of which motivates to define the cross product on J3() for any [formula]. The automorphism group of J3() with respect to the [formula]-bilinear Jordan product [formula] is denoted as follows:

[formula]

which is a complex (resp. compact; real split) simple Lie group of type (F4) (resp. (F4( - 52)); (F4(4))) when [formula] (resp. [formula]; ') by C. Chevalley and R.D. Schafer [\cite=CS1950] (resp. [\cite=Fh1951], [\cite=Fh1964], [\cite=Ms1989]; [\cite=Yi1977]). When [formula] or [formula], the group G() is a simple Lie group of type (A1),(A2) or (C3), respectively (cf. [\cite=Fh1964]). Put γ:J3()  →  J3();X  ↦  γX such that [formula] for [formula]. Put τ:J3()  →  J3();X  ↦  τX such as [formula]. Then [formula] such that [formula], [formula], (τX|τY)  =  τ(X|Y) and [formula], and that [formula], [formula] and [formula], so that [formula].

For X∈J3() and the indeterminate λ, put φX(λ): = λE  -  X. Then the characteristic polynomial of X is defined as the polynomial [formula] of λ with degree 3 and the derivative ΦX'(λ) is [formula], so that [formula] with some [formula]. In this case, the set {λ1,λ2,λ3} is said to be the characteristic roots of X. Put [formula] with #  ΛX∈{1,2,3} and [formula] with [formula].

Proposition 0.1. Let [formula] be K,K' or [formula] with [formula] or [formula].

(1) [formula]. And

[formula]

Especially, ΛαX  =  ΛX and vαX  =  vX for all X∈J3() and α∈G().

(2) G()τ is a maximal compact subgroup of G(). And γ∈G()τE1,E2,E3.

(3) [formula],

(4) Assume that   ≠  K, i.e., [formula] or '. Then:

() [formula],

() [formula].

Theorem 0.2. Let [formula] be [formula] or [formula]. Then the orbit decomposition of [formula] over [formula] or [formula] is given as follows:

(1) Take [formula]. Then #  ΛX  =  3,2 or 1.

() Assume that #  ΛX  =  3 with ΛX  =  {λ1,λ2,λ3}. Then [formula] with vX  =  3.

() Assume that #  ΛX  =  2 with ΛX  =  {λ1,λ2} such that ΦX'(λ2)  =  0. Then vX  =  2 or 3. Moreover:

(-1) vX  =  2 iff [formula]; and

(-2) vX  =  3 iff [formula].

() Assume that #  ΛX  =  1 with ΛX  =  {λ1}. Then:

(-1) vX  =  1 iff [formula];

(-2) vX  =  2 iff [formula]; and

(-3) vX  =  3 iff [formula].

(2) For [formula], [formula] iff ΛX  =  ΛY and vX  =  vY. For any [formula], [formula] and [formula].

Theorem 0.3. Let K' be ',' or '. Then the orbit decomposition of J3(K') over G(K') or [formula] is given as follows:

(1) Take X∈J3(K'). Then #  ΛX  =  3,2 or 1.

() Assume that #  ΛX  =  3. Then vX  =  3. And ΛX  =  {λ1,λ2,λ3} for some [formula] and [formula] such that [formula] or [formula] with some [formula] and [formula]. Moreover:

(-1) If [formula] with λ1  >  λ2  >  λ3, then [formula]; and

(-2) If [formula] with some [formula] such that q  >  0, then [formula].

() Assume that #  ΛX  =  2 with ΛX  =  {λ1,λ2} such that ΦX'(λ2)  =  0. Then [formula] and vX  =  2 or 3. Moreover:

(-1) vX  =  2 iff [formula]; and

(-2) vX  =  3 iff [formula].

() Assume that #  ΛX  =  1 with ΛX  =  {λ1}. Then [formula]. Moreover:

(-1) vX  =  1 iff [formula];

(-2) vX  =  2 iff [formula]; and

(-3) vX  =  3 iff [formula].

(2) For X,Y∈J3(K'), [formula] iff ΛX  =  ΛY and vX  =  vY. For any X∈J3(K'), [formula] and [formula].

By Proposition 0.1 (1), ΛX and vX are invariants on OG()(X), so that the Theorems 0.2 (2) and 0.3 (2) follow from Theorems 0.2 (1) and 0.3 (1), respectively. Hence, this paper is concentrated in proving Theorems 0.2 (1) and 0.3 (1) with Proposition 0.1.

Note that the second equality of Propositoin 0.1 (1) was obtained by N. Jacobson [\cite=Jn1959] in a more general setting (cf. [\cite=SV]). In § 1, by Lemma 1.2, it appears that the characteristic polynomial ΦX(λ) of X equals the generic minimal polynomial of X defined by N. Jacobson [\cite=Jn1968]. By Lemma 1.6 (3), it appears that vX equals the degree of N. Jacobson [\cite=Jn1968]'s minimal polynomial for X∈J3() with respect to the Jordan product.

Proof. (1) [formula], which equals the required one by Lemma 1.1 (2, 3) and [formula].

(2) The first equality folllows from (1). By Lemma 1.1 (3), [formula], so that [formula]. And [formula] by the second equality of Lemma 1.1 (4).

(3) The first claim follows from (1). For X∈J3(), put [formula]. Then [formula], so that [formula]. If ΦX(λ)  =  Π3i  =  1(λ  -  λi), then [formula], so that [formula], because of [formula] by (1). Hence, [formula].

Let V be an [formula]-algebra with the multiplication xy of x,y∈V. For x∈V, put an [formula]-linear endomorphism on V, Lx:V  →  V;y  ↦  xy, as the left translation by x. And put the automorphism group of V as follows:

[formula]

Lemma 1.3. (1) Let V be an [formula]-algbra. Assume that [formula]. Then [formula],  [formula] for all x∈V. If moreover V admits the identity element e, then αe  =  e.

(2) Let [formula] and L×X be the left translations by X∈J3() on J3() with respect to the product [formula] and the cross product ×  , respectively. Then [formula] and [formula].

Proof. (1) For x,y∈V and α∈G(V), L(αx)y  =  (αx)y  =  α(x(α- 1y))  =  (αLxα- 1)y, i.e. L(αx)  =  αLxα- 1, so that [formula] and [formula] as an [formula]-linear endomorphism on V. Assume that ex  =  xe  =  x for any x∈V. Take [formula]. Then (αe)(αx)  =  (αx)(αe)  =  αx, so that (αe)y  =  y(αe)  =  y for all y∈V. In particular, αe  =  (αe)e  =  e.

(2) [formula] forms an orthonormal basis of [formula] by Lemma 1.1 (1). And [formula] and L×X can be identified with a [formula]-linear endomorphism on [formula] or [formula]. By Lemma 1.1 (1, 2), [formula]; and [formula].

Proof of Proposition 0.1 (1). The first claim follows from Lemma 1.3 (1)(2). For the second claim, since [formula] is defined by [formula], [formula] and E, the first equality is recognized as the inclusion [formula]. By [formula], the 2nd equality is recognized as the inclusion [formula]. By Lemmas 1.1 (4) and 1.2 (1), the 3rd equality is recognized as the inclusion [formula]. By polarizing 3 det(X)  =  (X|X|X) with Lemma 1.1 (2), the 4th equality is recognized as the inclusion [formula]. Assume that [formula] and (αX)  ×  (αY)  =  α(X  ×  Y) for all X,Y∈J3(). By Lemma 1.3, [formula]. By Lemma 1.1 (4), [formula], so that (αX|αY)  =  (X|Y). By the definition of ×  , [formula], so that [formula] for all X,Y,Z∈J3().

Proof of Proposition 0.1 (2). Note that τγ  =  γτ, γEi  =  Ei, γE  =  E and [formula] by Lemma 1.1 (1), so that γ∈G()τE1,E2,E3. By Proposition 0.1 (1), the last claim follows. For the first claim, put [formula] for X,Y∈J3(), which defines a positive-definite symmetric (or hermitian) 2-form on J3(K') (resp. [formula]) over [formula] (resp. [formula]) by Lemma 1.1 (1). For α∈G(), α*∈GLF(J3()) is defined such that <  αX|Y >   =    <  X|α*Y >  for all X,Y∈J3(). By (1), <  X|α*Y  >    =  (ταX|Y)  =  τ(αX|τY)  =  τ(X|α- 1τY)  =   < X|τα- 1τY > , so that α*  =  τα- 1τ∈G() because of (1) by [formula] and α*E  =  τα- 1τE  =  E.

By Lemma 1.1 (1), [formula], so that [formula] for all [formula] by Proposition 0.1 (1), as required. Note that Bi(a) is nothing but Ãai given in H. Freudenthal [\cite=Fh1951].

For [formula], put Cν(t): = (eνt  +  e-  νt) / 2, Sν(t): = (eνt  -  e-  νt) / (2ν) as [formula]-valued functions of [formula]. Then (Cν(t),Sν(t))  =  ( cosh (t), sinh (t)) or ( cos (t), sin (t)) if ν  =  1 or [formula], respectively. Note that

Lemma 1.6. (1) For a positive integer m, let [formula] be a J3()-valued polynomial of E and [formula] with respect to [formula], ×   and the scalar multiples of [formula], (Xi|Xj), [formula] and (Xi|Xj|Xk) for [formula]. Assume that [formula] for any [formula] and all diagonal forms X1 in [formula]. Then [formula] for all [formula].

(5) [formula] and [formula].

Proof. (1) (cf. [\cite=Fh1951], [\cite=Yi1975], [\cite=FK1994]): By Lemma 1.5 (2), any X1∈J3(K) admits some [formula] such that βX1 is a diagonal form in [formula]. Then [formula] for any Xi∈J3(K) with [formula]. By Proposition 0.1, β preserves [formula], ×  , [formula], ( * | * ), [formula], ( * |  *  | * ) and E, so that [formula] for all [formula]. Hence, [formula] for all [formula]. Since this formula consists of some polynomial equations on the [formula]-coefficients of each matrix entry of Xi's with respect to the [formula]-basis {ej} of K, the formula holds on [formula].

(2) The formulas in () and () are polynomials of X,Y and E with respect to [formula], ×  , [formula], ( * | * ), [formula], ( * |  *  | * ). If X is a diagonal form in [formula], the formulas can be checked by Lemma 1.1 (1), easily. By (1), the formulas () and () hold for any [formula]. Hence, they hold for any [formula]. The formula () follows from the first formula of () and the definition of cross product with [formula].

(5) By (2) (), [formula], so that (X×  2)×  2  =  0 if and only if [formula], which gives the results.

The formula () of Lemma 1.6 (2) implies that [formula] is a Jordan algebra over [formula], which is also reduced simple in the sense of N. Jacobson [\cite=Jn1968], where J3() is called split iff [formula] is split (i.e. non-division), that is the case when   =  K' or [formula].

Proof of "Proposition 0.1 (3) when   =  K" (cf, [\cite=Fh1951], [\cite=Yi1968]). Take any [formula]. By Lemma 1.5 (2) with [formula], there exists [formula] such that [formula] for some r1,r2,r3∈. By [formula] and (αX)×  2  =  0, r1  +  r2  +  r3  =  1 and r2r3  =  r3r1  =  r1r2  =  0, so that (r1,r2,r3)  =  (1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1). By Lemma 1.4 (1) (), there exists [formula] such that (αX)  =  E1.

[\cite=Yi1968], [\cite=Ms1989], [\cite=So2006], [\cite=FK1994]), which is developing to Lemma 1.5 (2) for [formula] with [formula] under the action of [formula]. I. Yokota [\cite=Yi1968] proved the connectedness and the simply connectedness of F4 by the diagonalization theorem of H. Freudenthal (cf. [\cite=My1954], [\cite=Ms1989], [\cite=GOV1994]). O. Shukuzawa & I. Yokota [\cite=SY1979] (cf. [\cite=Yi1977]) proved the connectedness of F4': = G(') by showing the first formula of Proposition 0.1 (1) by virtue of Hamilton-Cayley formula on J3(') given as the first formula of Lemma 1.6(2)() (cf. [\cite=SV], [\cite=Hfr1990]). Because of [formula] with [formula] [\cite=Yi1990] (cf. Proposition 0.1 (2)), [formula] is connected and simply connected, so that [formula] is again proved to be connected by virtue of a theorem of P.K. Rasevskii [\cite=Rpk1974].

Proof. (1) Put Z: = φX(λ1) and Y: = Z×  2, so that Y×  2  =  0 by Lemma 1.6 (4). Then [formula], [formula] and E×  2X,λ1  =  0, so that [formula]. Note that [formula], so that φEX,λ1(1)  ≠  0.

If WX,λ1  =  0, then [formula] and [formula], so that VX is spanned by EX,λ1 and φEX,λ1(1)  =  E  -  EX,λ1, i.e. vX  =  2. By Lemmas 1.1 (2) and 1.6 (3), L×2EX,λ1 is a symmetric [formula]-linear transformation on (VX,( * | * )), so that EX,λ1,φEX,λ1(1),WX,λ1 are orthogonal as zero or eigen-vectors of L×2EX,λ1 with the different eigen-values.

WX,λ1  ≠  0) iff vX  =  2 (resp. vX  =  3) by Lemma 3.1 (2). If ΔX(λ1)  ≠  0, then (W'|W')  ≠  0, so that W'  ≠  0 and λ2  ≠  λ3, i.e. vX  =    #  ΛX  =  3: By Lemma 2.2 (1) (-1, 2) or (2) (), W: = βW' is given as (1) (-1, 2) or (2) () for some [formula], so that [formula].

In all cases, put ΛX  =  {λ1,λ2,λ3} with #  ΛX  =  3 or 2 such that ΦX'(λ1)  ≠  0 and [formula], so that ΔX(λ1)  =  (λ2  -  λ3)2  /  2 by Lemmas 3.1 (2) and 2.3 (2).
