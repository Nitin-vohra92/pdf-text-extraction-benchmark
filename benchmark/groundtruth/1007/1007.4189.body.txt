The Carter Constant for Inclined Orbits About a Massive Kerr Black Hole: I. circular orbits

Introduction

In his landmark work of 1968, Brandon Carter derived a new constant of motion that pertained to orbital motion in the gravitational field of a Kerr black hole (KBH) [\cite=1968PhRv..174.1559C]. In due course, this constant became known as the Carter constant, which joins the set of important constants of motion: orbital angular momentum (Lz, z-axis projection), orbital energy (E), and finally the Carter constant (Q). These constants of motion can be developed rigorously from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation [\cite=1968PhRv..174.1559C] [\cite=1973blho.conf...57C] [\cite=H.:2005zl].

An extreme mass ratio binary black hole system is composed of a secondary object (which may be a compact object (CO) of several solar masses) in orbit around a primary object (which is a massive black hole (MBH) of several million solar masses). Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are expected to emit gravitational wave radiation (GW) of sufficiently high energy and in the appropriate frequency band for detection by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) to be feasible [\cite=PhysRevD.61.084004] [\cite=2006PhRvD..73f4037G] [\cite=2006PhRvD..73h3006M] [\cite=2007PThPh.117.1041G]. The emission of GW causes the constants of motion to evolve, which in turn affects the GW power spectrum. Therefore some useful methods have been developed to describe this evolution. For example, the quadrupole formalism [\cite=PhysRev.131.435] [\cite=PhysRev.136.B1224] [\cite=Thorne:1987fk] [\cite=Barack:2004uq] and the Teukolsky equation [\cite=1973ApJ...181..513P] [\cite=1973ApJ...185..635T] [\cite=1973ApJ...185..649P] have yielded important results. The analytical description of the evolution of Q has been more difficult to achieve than it has for the other two constants of motion [\cite=PhysRevD.55.3444]; although the use of the Teukolsky equation has shown great promise [\cite=1995PhLA..202..347O] [\cite=PhysRevD.55.3444] [\cite=PhysRevD.61.084004] [\cite=2006PhRvD..73f4037G] [\cite=2007PThPh.117.1041G] in this endeavour.

As the CO inspirals, the gravitational radiation reaction causes the value of Q to change [\cite=1995PhLA..202..347O] [\cite=Ryan:1996ly] [\cite=1996PhRvD..53.4319K] [\cite=PhysRevD.55.3444] [\cite=PhysRevD.61.084004] [\cite=2001PhRvD..64f4004H] [\cite=2002PhRvD..66d4002G] [\cite=2002PhRvD..66f4005G] [\cite=2006PhRvD..73f4037G] [\cite=2007PhRvD..76d4007B] [\cite=2007PThPh.117.1041G]. Therefore a non-equatorial orbit lists as its angle of inclination, ι, increases with respect to time; a near-polar prograde orbit becomes polar, and ultimately retrograde [\cite=Ryan:1995ix] [\cite=Ryan:1996ly]. Such listing behaviour of an inclined orbit has been studied and confirmed using the most current Teukolsky-based fluxes [\cite=2007PhRvD..76d4007B]. It is our goal to develop an analytical and numerical methodology for testing and improving radiation reaction models for predicting orbit listing and inspirals for near-polar orbits.

Our interest lies in studying KBH systems; yet, the Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) is an important datum. An infinitesimal amount of spin angular momentum ([formula]) may be imparted to an MBH such that, for practical purposes, it can be regarded as an SBH (by virtue of its minuscule effect on the surrounding spacetime); and yet, the spherical symmetry of the system has been broken and a z-axis defined. Then an SBH can be considered to have a prograde or retrograde inclined orbit; and the set of polar orbits define the abutment, at which Q will be at its maximum value (Q is non-negative for any bound orbit), for given values of [formula], e, and S̃ (ceteris paribus).

In section [\ref=sec:The-Motion-of-a-Test-Particle] the motion of a test-particle in an inclined orbit is analysed from first principles [\cite=1973blho.conf..215B] [\cite=1983bhwd.book.....S] [\cite=1983mtbh.book.....C] [\cite=Schutz:2005fk] to yield the effective radial potential and an analytical expression of [formula] for a last stable orbit (LSO). In section [\ref=sec:Analysis-of-the-Trajectory-Equations] we continue our analysis to find the roots of the effective radial and polar-angle potentials and use them to derive analytical expressions for Ẽ and X2 (where [formula]). The concept of the abutment is then refined. In section [\ref=sec:The-characteristics-of-the-Carter-Constant-Equations], we derive a set of critical formulae that express Q at the LSO, along the abutment, and for the set of polar orbits. The interrelationships between these formulae are examined and a map of admissible values of Q, with respect to [formula] and e is drawn. In section [\ref=sec:The-Analysis-of-the-Carter-Constant], this map is used to better understand the path in the Q-[formula] plane that is followed by an evolving circular orbit. We demonstrate the importance of the first and second derivatives of Q (on the abutment) with respect to [formula] for understanding the rate of change of ι as the orbit lists.

We shall use geometrical units by In addition, many of the parameters we use will be normalised with respect to the mass of the black hole (M) or with respect to the test-particle mass (m). In appendix A, the symbols used in this paper are tabulated. By emphasising normalised variables, the analytical equations and numerical formalism are much better handled.

The Motion of a Test-Particle in an Inclined Orbit

A sound mathematical analysis can be made on the assumption that the secondary body is of infinitesimal mass (i.e. a test-particle). In such a case, the background metric of the MBH dominates. In the case of EMRIs, the small ratio of the CO mass to the MBH mass ([formula]) warrants our use of idealised test-particle calculations [\cite=PhysRevD.61.084004] [\cite=2000PhRvD..62l4022O] [\cite=2006PhRvD..73f4037G] [\cite=2007PThPh.117.1041G].

Basic orbital equations

We begin by considering a test-particle in orbit about a KBH of arbitrary spin, S̃, for which the four-momentum can be given the general definition [\cite=Komorowski:2008wc],

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Unlike the analysis in Komorowski et al. [\cite=Komorowski:2008wc], we shall use normalised variables at the outset and offer a more thorough treatment. Because we are now considering inclined elliptical orbits, one cannot simplify the four-momentum by setting [formula]. But by knowing the Carter constant in terms of normalised variables (i.e. obtained by dividing through by mM),

[formula]

one can obtain the component of orbital angular momentum, [formula], projected upon the equatorial plane of the KBH,

[formula]

and substitute it into the expression for the four-momentum:

[formula]

The invariant quantity,

[formula]

is calculated tensorially using the inverse Kerr metric (see Appendix B) and used to develop the radial orbital equation for a test-particle:

[formula]

By setting Q = 0, equation ([\ref=eq:Orbital_Equation_Q]) reduces to the equation for an equatorial orbit (see [\cite=2002PhRvD..66d4002G])

At the radial turning points, [formula]. Equation ([\ref=eq:Orbital_Equation_Q]) becomes:

[formula]

In the limit [formula] (set S̃ = 0 while retaining a non-zero value for Q) equation ([\ref=eq:Orbital_Equation_Q_Turning_Point]) becomes

[formula]

Thus, the square of the total orbital angular momentum, [formula], confirms that, for the specific case of an SBH, Q represents the square of the component of angular momentum projected on x - y plane of the coordinate system (see Appendix B in Schmidt [\cite=2002CQGra..19.2743S] and Appendix C in this paper for a more detailed treatment).

Some important research [\cite=2002PhRvD..66f4005G] [\cite=2008PhRvD..77l4050S] has been performed by working with the orbital inclination angle, ι, instead of Q; but in our study, the value of Q will be taken as a system parameter. If Q is chosen to be zero, then the orbital plane coincides with the equatorial plane of the KBH (i.e. ι = 0 and [formula]) and for a test-particle in a polar orbit (i.e. [formula] and 0  ≤  θ  ≤  π) [formula] must vanish. The choice of working directly with the Carter constant, Q, as a system parameter is consistent with the approach taken by Carter [\cite=1968PhRv..174.1559C] and more recently emphasised by others [\cite=2006PhRvD..73b4027D] [\cite=2006PhRvD..73f4037G] [\cite=2007PhRvD..76d4007B].

Effective Radial Potential

To proceed, we use a version of equation ([\ref=eq:Orbital_Equation_Q]), which is quadratic in, Ẽ,

[formula]

The roots of this equation can be used to determine the effective potential of the test-particle (ṽ±):

[formula]

where

[formula]

When the last stable orbit (LSO) is reached, Ẽ corresponds to a local maximum of ṽ+ closest to the event horizon. Therefore one calculates the derivative of ṽ+ with respect to R and equates it to zero, i.e.

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Orbital Angular Momentum at the Last Stable Orbit

We can now develop an equation for the [formula] of a test-particle in an inclined orbit about a KBH (in a manner similar to that described in [\cite=Komorowski:2008wc]) and extend the concept to general orbits. It should be noted, the value of [formula] considered here is not valid for general orbits, but pertains to the LSO. After eliminating the square root in equation ([\ref=eq:diffVbyR]) to yield a new equation that is quadratic in, [formula], the solution is found to be:

[formula]

which provides a relationship between [formula] and R (which here, represents the pericentre radius) of the test-particle LSO. This result is independent of whether one begins the calculation with ṽ+ or ṽ-.

One can now plot [formula] with respect to the value of the pericentre (the point of closest approach, Rp) for an LSO for the cases where S̃ = 0.0 (Figure [\ref=fig:SBH]), S̃ = 0.5 (Figure [\ref=fig:KBH_S_0.5]) and S̃ = 0.99 (Figure [\ref=fig:KBH_S_0.99]). The values of [formula] calculated for an SBH are plotted in Figure [\ref=fig:SBH] for the range of Q values 0.0 to 16.0.

For an SBH, the prograde (plus) and retrograde (minus) formulae for [formula] (equation ([\ref=eq:LzSquared])) are reflections of one another about the R axis (Figure [\ref=fig:SBH]). But when S̃ > 0, the plus equations are pulled below the R axis and this symmetry is lost (Figures [\ref=fig:KBH_S_0.5] and [\ref=fig:KBH_S_0.99]). There now exists a set of retrograde LSOs which are governed by the plus form of equation ([\ref=eq:LzSquared]). The importance of this fact is revealed when we set the quantity beneath the square root in equation ([\ref=eq:LzSquared]) to zero; i.e.

[formula]

The polynomial describes the boundary at which the plus and minus equations for [formula] are equal and it offers an insight into the behaviour of Q for LSOs that are nearly polar (ι≃π / 2). If S̃ = 0, then for an elliptical LSO [\cite=PhysRevD.50.3816] [\cite=Barack:2004uq] [\cite=Komorowski:2008wc],

[formula]

By substituting equation ([\ref=eq:R_pericentre]) into equation ([\ref=eq:R_LSO_Abutment]) and solving for Q, one obtains:

[formula]

This result applies to LSOs at the boundary and specifies an upper limit on Q for orbits around an SBH. Now we must develop these ideas for general orbits about a KBH that have not yet reached their LSO.

Analysis of the Trajectory Equations

Introduction

There exist four trajectory equations [\cite=1968PhRv..174.1559C] [\cite=Bardeen:1972fi] [\cite=2002CQGra..19.2743S] in two categories:

(those that are periodic in radius, R, or polar angle, θ)

[formula]

[formula]

(those that are monotonically increasing in azimuthal angle, φ, or coordinate time, t)

[formula]

[formula]

See Appendix B to see equations for functions [formula], ṽθ, ṽφ, and ṽt. We have already developed equation ([\ref=eq:rho-drbydt]) in section [\ref=sub:Basic-orbital-equations] (equation ([\ref=eq:Orbital_Equation_Q])). And equation ([\ref=eq:rho-dthetabydt]) can also be developed by a similar method (see Appendix C).

One obtains, viz. equations ([\ref=eq:rho-drbydt]) and ([\ref=eq:rho-dthetabydt]), the following condition

[formula]

on the geodesic of the test-particle, which is a general form of the equation specified by Schmidt (equation (16) in [\cite=2002CQGra..19.2743S]). Given equation ([\ref=eq:rho-dthetabydt]) [\cite=Bardeen:1972fi], one can find the proper time of the orbit:

[formula]

where the integral has been split into its separate R and θ integral terms viz. equation ([\ref=eq:equality-on-geodesic]). The same result is found when starting with equation ([\ref=eq:rho-drbydt]) instead. Two other important integrals that can be calculated for coordinate time and azimuthal angle are given in Schmidt (equations (14) and (15) [\cite=2002CQGra..19.2743S]) in which a detailed analysis is made on the basis of the Hamiltonian. Equation ([\ref=eq:Tao-Integral]) can be solved to yield elliptic functions [\cite=2002PhRvD..66d4002G]; therefore, the roots of ṽR and Vθ contain information necessary for deriving analytical formulae for Q in terms of [formula] and e (for given S̃) and ι as a function of Q. This will be shown in sections [\ref=sub:Roots-of-the-Polar-Angle-Equation] and [\ref=sec:The-characteristics-of-the-Carter-Constant-Equations].

Roots of the Radial Equation

We introduce [formula] and convert equation ([\ref=eq:Orbital_Equation_Q_Turning_Point]) to the form:

[formula]

This substitution is consistent with the approach in [\cite=Komorowski:2008wc] and that undertaken by Glampedakis and Kennefick [\cite=2002PhRvD..66d4002G]; and it will help us to derive the latus rectum of the LSO. Analytically, the use of X2 in this case offers an advantage over the use of L2z.

Elliptical Orbits.

By finding the four roots of equation ([\ref=eq:Orbital_Equation_Q_X]) one can derive analytical formulae for X and Ẽ, in terms of e, [formula], Q, and S̃, which apply to general orbits (and are not limited to the LSO). Although the roots are easily obtained in terms of the constants of motion: [formula], Ẽ, and Q; they are complicated and as such not helpful. To simplify the analysis, we assume a priori that an inclined orbit can be characterised by an eccentricity, e [\cite=1987GReGr..19.1235S]. Therefore the radius of the orbit at its pericentre is described by

[formula]

and correspondingly, at its apocentre

[formula]

To proceed, consider an expansion of the four possible roots [formula]:

[formula]

By equating the coefficients of the two polynomials in equations ([\ref=eq:Orbital_Equation_Q_X]) and ([\ref=eq:Polynomial_Expansion]) one obtains the two independent equations:

[formula]

and

[formula]

which have been simplified viz. equations ([\ref=eq:Root_Pericentre]) and ([\ref=eq:Root_Apocentre]). Let us solve equations ([\ref=eq:q1]) and ([\ref=eq:q2]) to obtain:

[formula]

and

[formula]

where

[formula]

If Q = 0 then selecting the minus sign in equation ([\ref=eq:r3]) yields r3 = 0; therefore, the plus sign is the one taken as physically meaningful. For Q = 0, equation ([\ref=eq:r3]) reduces to

[formula]

which applies to an equatorial orbit. The value of r4 equals zero when Q = 0 as can be seen in equation ([\ref=eq:r4]).

Parabolic Orbits.

Parabolic orbits have importance to the empirical study of the interaction of stars with massive black holes (MBHs) [\cite=2001ApJ...560L.143A] [\cite=2004ApJ...610..707B]. For parabolic orbits both e = 1 and Ẽ = 1. We refer back to equation ([\ref=eq:Orbital_Equation_Q_X]); and set Ẽ = 1:

[formula]

There are now three possible finite roots [formula], which can be used in a new general equation (ra is infinite in the case of a parabolic orbit):

[formula]

The pericentre simplifies (viz. e  =  1) to become,

[formula]

and correspondingly, at its apocentre,

[formula]

We obtain the solutions for the additional roots:

[formula]

and

[formula]

where

[formula]

Roots of the Polar-Angle Equation

Let us focus on the denominator of the second term in equation ([\ref=eq:Tao-Integral]), i.e. [formula], to derive an analytical relationship for the limits of integration, θ1 and θ2, from which one may determine ι. We shall work with ṽθ in terms of [formula], i.e.

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=eq:Tao-Integral]) is an elliptic integral; thus the limits of integration correspond to the zeros of the denominator. By making the substitution

[formula]

the integral, I, becomes

[formula]

for which the roots, [formula], can be calculated and used to determine (viz. [formula]) the exact angle of inclination of an orbit for which the values of S̃, Q, and z are known, when working in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. We will calculate ι using

[formula]

which differs from the approximation in [\cite=2002PhRvD..66f4005G] [\cite=2006PhRvD..73f4037G]. N.B.: in dealing with results that are first-order and third-order in S̃, one may consider the approximation to ι to be reasonably close to equation ([\ref=eq:Theta-Roots-Equatorial]) [\cite=2011arXiv1101.0996K].

Orbital Energy and an Analytical Expression for X2

As outlined in [\cite=2002PhRvD..66d4002G], the next step will be to develop a formula for orbital energy, Ẽ, in terms of e, [formula], and X2. By referring to equations ([\ref=eq:Orbital_Equation_Q_X]) and ([\ref=eq:Polynomial_Expansion]), this derivation proceeds by solving

[formula]

to yield

[formula]

for which we use the positive case. For Q = 0, equation ([\ref=eq:E4]) simplifies to

[formula]

which is the expression for Ẽ in an equatorial orbit.

It is interesting to observe that for an inclined orbit around an SBH (S̃ = 0), the equation for Ẽ (equation ([\ref=eq:E4])) reduces to

[formula]

which is the expression for orbital energy of a test-particle in orbit around an SBH, (Cutler, Kennefick, and Poisson (see equation (2.5) in [\cite=PhysRevD.50.3816])). Further, this equation for Ẽ shows no dependence on Q. This property is expected since the orbital energy must be independent of orientation in the spherically symmetric coordinate system of an SBH.

In the general case, we observe that Ẽ is a function of X2 (see equation ([\ref=eq:E4])); and thus it is not in explicit form because [formula]. Therefore the use of X2 in place of [formula] simplifies the analysis by avoiding an unending recursive substitution of Ẽ into the equation. Although one may derive a formula for Ẽ in explicit form, it is better to perform the analysis using equation ([\ref=eq:E4]).

To calculate an analytical expression for X2, we substitute equation ([\ref=eq:E4]) into our original quartic (equation ([\ref=eq:Orbital_Equation_Q_Turning_Point])) and evaluate it at either rp or ra (the two simplest choices of the four roots) to yield:

[formula]

By eliminating the square root, and solving for X2 in the resulting quadratic, one obtains:

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

X2± has a minus and a plus solution, which we will carefully describe in the next section. We have avoided the analytical difficulties that would arise by working with [formula] directly. Indeed, the advantage of using [formula] is more than a simple change of variables, but rather an essential step in solving these equations.

Prograde and Retrograde Descriptions of X2

The expression for X2± (see equation ([\ref=eq:X2])) contains the square root, [formula], for which, Q is found only in Z9 as a quadratic. Therefore it is easy to derive an expression for Q for which Z9 = 0 and thus determine where the minus and plus equations for X2± meet or abut (viz. Z9 = 0). This information is important for determining which form of equation ([\ref=eq:X2]) to use. We will call the set of general orbits for which Z9 = 0, the abutment, to avoid confusing it with the result for the boundary between the plus and minus forms of [formula] at the LSO.

A prograde orbit has an [formula]. Correspondingly, when [formula] the orbit is retrograde; and if [formula], the orbit is polar. When using the minus and plus forms of the equation for X2± (equation ([\ref=eq:X2])), one must recognise that X2- governs all of the prograde orbits, the polar orbits, and the near-polar retrograde orbits up to the abutment; and X2+ governs the remaining retrograde orbits. If one considers an SBH system then the abutment will be comprised only of polar orbits (and it is only then that X2± cleanly separates the prograde and retrograde orbits). If S̃ > 0, the abutment will always consist of retrograde orbits.

For orbits governed by X2+, [formula]; but for those governed by X2-, the choice of sign depends on the value of Q. The plot of X2- with respect to Q for a circular orbit with [formula] about a KBH of S̃ = 0.5 (Figure [\ref=fig:X2plot]) shows that for ∂X-  /  ∂Q to remain continuous over the range of real values of Q, the minus sign must be chosen when evaluating X- for Q  >  Qswitch. An analytical formula for Qswitch can be found by solving X2- = 0 for Q. The general solution is

[formula]

and for an SBH

[formula]

For large orbits ([formula]) equation ([\ref=eq:Q_switch]) can be converted to its asymptotic form by first factoring out [formula] from each term to obtain,

[formula]

for which the denominator may be brought up to the numerator to yield

[formula]

In the limit as [formula],

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=eq:Q_switch_large_l]) describes the locus of points at which [formula] (which is effectively constant for large [formula]); therefore, Qswitch does not describe a trajectory.

We have developed two formulae: one for the [formula] at the LSO (equation ([\ref=eq:LzSquared])) and the other for the X2± of general circular and elliptical orbits (equation ([\ref=eq:X2])). For each, there is an expression that describes where the plus and minus forms are equal. For [formula], the boundary between the plus and minus forms is described by

[formula]

where Rp represents the pericentre. And for X2±, the abutment is described by

[formula]

As equations ([\ref=eq:RpericentreLSO_Abutment]) and ([\ref=eq:LatusRectumGeneralAbutment]) describe the boundaries (where the plus and minus forms are equal) that pertain to different quantities ([formula] and X2±) they will not in general coincide. If one substitutes [formula] into equation ([\ref=eq:RpericentreLSO_Abutment]) one obtains:

[formula]

which equals equation ([\ref=eq:LatusRectumGeneralAbutment]) when e = 0, (i.e. for a circular orbit). If S̃ = 0 (SBH case), then [formula] and the two boundaries must be identical. If one substitutes [formula] into equation ([\ref=eq:LatusRectumGeneralAbutment]) and solves for Q, then the same expression as in equation ([\ref=eq:Q_Lz_Schwarzschild]) is obtained.

The Characteristics of the Carter Constant Equations and the Domain of the Orbital Parameters

Introduction

In describing an arbitrary orbit, it must be recognised that each parameter ([formula], e, and Q) has a domain. The value of e lies between 0, for a circular orbit, and 1 for a parabolic orbit. Although [formula] has no upper limit, its minimum value is [formula]; while Q, which is non-negative, does have an upper limit that depends on the size of [formula]. The complicated interrelationships between these parameters can be better understood if we derive a set of analytical formulae to describe the behaviour of Q with respect to [formula] and e. In the sections that follow, we shall examine the LSO, abutment, and polar orbits. A representative plot of these curves is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:S=00003D0.99] for [formula] and a KBH spin of S̃ = 0.99.

Last Stable Orbit

In [\cite=Komorowski:2008wc] a new analytical formula for the latus rectum of an elliptical equatorial LSO was developed. We can perform a similar treatment for inclined LSOs; but the polynomial that results is of ninth order in [formula], currently making the derivation of an analytical solution infeasible. The use of the companion matrix [\cite=1996maco.book.....G] [\cite=Edelman:1995rz] [\cite=Komorowski:2008wc] simplifies the numerical calculation of the prograde and retrograde [formula].

We refer back to equations ([\ref=eq:Root_Pericentre]), ([\ref=eq:Root_Apocentre]), ([\ref=eq:r3]), and ([\ref=eq:r4]); but because Ẽ will equal the maximum value of ṽ+ (closest to the event horizon) we can specify r3  =  rp as an additional condition [\cite=1983mtbh.book.....C] [\cite=PhysRevD.50.3816] [\cite=Komorowski:2008wc]. Therefore the remaining root, r4, can be easily solved viz.

[formula]

to yield,

[formula]

Substituting the four roots (two of which are equal) into equation ([\ref=eq:4rs]) yields

[formula]

Substituting the expression for Ẽ (equation ([\ref=eq:E4])) into equation ([\ref=eq:LSO_Roots_Equation]) and cross multiplying, we obtain:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

By setting Z10 = 0 and substituting the formula for X2± (viz. equation ([\ref=eq:X2])) one obtains a polynomial, [formula], in terms of [formula] (to order 9), e, Q (to second order), and S̃ (see equation ([\ref=eq:CP_LSO]) in Appendix B). The companion matrix of [formula] provides a powerful method to calculate the values of [formula] for both a prograde and retrograde LSO by numerically evaluating the eigenvalues of the matrix. Optimised techniques for solving for eigenvalues are available [\cite=ISI:000074991300004] [\cite=2005JPhCS..16..425Y]. Such a numerical analysis was performed to obtain representative values of [formula]. The corresponding values of [formula], which we derived from Z11 = 0 (ceteris paribus) were smaller and thus not physically reachable by a test-particle. This result demonstrates that Z10 = 0 is the appropriate solution.

Because [formula] is a quadratic in terms of Q, an alternative way to analyse the behaviour of orbits as they approach their LSO is available. One solves for Q, analytically, to obtain:

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

We now have, through equation ([\ref=eq:Q_LSO]), the means to plot the value of QLSO with respect to [formula]. For a KBH, one may use [formula] in the domain [formula] as the independent variable.

The Abutment

The roots of equation ([\ref=eq:Z9]) allow us to calculate the value of Q along the abutment (QX) in terms of the orbital values of [formula], e, and the KBH spin, S̃; and we obtain, taking the minus sign of the quadratic solution:

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=eq:Q_Abutment]) appears to have poles at S̃ = 0 and e = 1; but we can demonstrate that it reduces to a well behaved function at these values of S̃ and e. We first factor out the term, [formula], to obtain

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=eq:Q_Abutment_Intermediate_Form]) can be simplified by making a binomial expansion of its square root to yield,

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=eq:Q_Abutment_Intermediate_Form_2]), simplifies to a power series in terms of [formula]; therefore, only the first term will remain when S̃ = 0 or e = 1. We now have a greatly simplified expression, which applies to elliptic orbits around an SBH and parabolic orbits about a KBH, i.e.

[formula]

Further, as [formula] in elliptical orbits,

[formula]

therefore, a similar binomial treatment may be performed on equation ([\ref=eq:Q_Abutment_Intermediate_Form]) to yield [formula] for large [formula]. This result is consistent with the fact that as [formula], the spacetime looks more Schwarzschild in nature. As in the case of equation ([\ref=eq:Q_Lz_Schwarzschild]), QX (equation ([\ref=eq:Q_Abutment])) also defines an upper limit on Q for specific values of [formula] and e. The points above the QX curve are inaccessible; and this property can be shown by direct calculation.

This result confirms the choice of the minus sign in solving the quadratic equation ([\ref=eq:LatusRectumGeneralAbutment]) for QX. Recall that equation ([\ref=eq:X2]) applies to bound orbits in general and is not restricted to LSOs (as is the case for L2z (see equation ([\ref=eq:LzSquared]))); therefore, the value of QX can be evaluated for all values of [formula]; and it will apply to both sets of orbits governed by X2- or X2+.

Polar Orbit

We shall consider polar orbits in this paper; although orbits of arbitrary inclination are also important. The polar orbit (governed by X2-) is precisely defined by setting [formula] from which we obtain X2-  =  S̃2Ẽ2; therefore, we can derive an analytical formula for Q of a polar orbit (Qpolar) of arbitrary [formula] and e.

We have the formula for X2- in terms of [formula], e, and Q (see equation ([\ref=eq:X2])); and Ẽ can also be expressed in these terms (see equation ([\ref=eq:E4])). Therefore X2-  -  S̃2Ẽ2 = 0 can be simplified and factored to yield:

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

The factor, A, offers no physically meaningful results. It does not provide a solution for Q; and for [formula] and [formula], we find that [formula], which lies beyond the LSO. The factor, [formula], yields the result

[formula]

And the factor, [formula], yields the result

[formula]

We examine equations ([\ref=eq:Q_polar_physical]) and ([\ref=eq:Q_polar_unphysical]) to discover which one is physically significant. In the Schwarzschild limit ([formula]) we find that they coincide. But let us consider the weak-field limit ([formula]). Equation ([\ref=eq:Q_polar_physical]), [formula], can be expanded in powers of [formula]. And the terms with powers of [formula] and lower approach zero as [formula] to yield the asymptotic limit of equation ([\ref=eq:Q_polar_physical]):

[formula]

In a similar treatment of equation ([\ref=eq:Q_polar_unphysical]) one obtains:

[formula]

which we can disregard as unphysical because it incorrectly implies that the spin of the KBH influences the trajectory of a test-particle at infinity. This situation differs from that described by equation ([\ref=eq:Q_switch_large_l]), which does not describe a trajectory. Test calculations confirm that equation ([\ref=eq:Q_polar_physical]) is the appropriate choice and equation ([\ref=eq:Q_polar_unphysical]) can be disregarded since the values of [formula] obtained by solving equation ([\ref=eq:Q_polar_unphysical]) are less than (or equal to) the results from equation ([\ref=eq:Q_polar_physical]) (ceteris paribus). Equation ([\ref=eq:Q_polar_physical]) applies to all bound orbits, hence Qpolar can be evaluated over a range [formula]; but it applies only to orbits governed by X2-. In the SBH case (S̃ = 0), [formula] and [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

which has an asymptotic behaviour similar to that of QX.

Some Characteristics of the Carter Constant Formulae

The last stable orbit on the abutment.

In Figures ([\ref=fig:S=00003D0.99]) and ([\ref=fig:The-three-important]) one observes that the functions for QX and QLSO intersect at a single tangential point, which represents the value of [formula] of an LSO that lies at the abutment described by X2±. The equation QX  -  QLSO = 0 (see equations ([\ref=eq:Q_Abutment]) and ([\ref=eq:Q_LSO])) can be solved to yield:

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

It is at this tangential point that the QLSO curve is split into two segments: the minus segment ([formula]) that defines the values of [formula] (and QLSO) associated with inclined LSOs that are governed by X2-; and the plus segment ([formula]), which corresponds to inclined LSOs governed by X2+. Consequently, the points beneath QLSO define only orbits governed by X2-. Further, orbits with [formula] and Q values that lie to the left of the minus segment of QLSO are undefined. Therefore the QLSO curve for [formula] and the QX curve for [formula] define a curve along which the upper limit of Q is specified.

Calculations of the value of [formula] (equation ([\ref=eq:LSO_Abutment])) were performed for various eccentricities and two values of KBH spin (S̃ = 0.5 and S̃ = 0.99); they are listed in table [\ref=tab:Maxima-Minima_LSO]. We have also numerically calculated the values of [formula] for the maximal point of the QLSO curve and listed them for comparison. For both circular and parabolic orbits,

[formula]

irrespective of the value of S̃. Otherwise,

[formula]

from which one may infer the curve that specifies the upper limit of Q is monotonically increasing with respect to [formula] (with a point of inflection at [formula] for circular and parabolic orbits). The values of [formula] show that the upper limit of Q also increases monotonically with respect to e. Further, [formula] for a parabolic orbit, which equals the [formula] of a parabolic orbit about an SBH.

The last stable polar orbit.

The polar curve applies to polar orbits, which are governed by X2-; therefore, only the intersection of the Qpolar curve with the minus segment of the QLSO curve ([formula]) needs to be considered. It is at this point that the [formula] of a polar orbit of arbitrary e is defined. It was found from numerical calculations of [formula] (where the Qpolar curve intersects the minus segment of the QLSO curve) and [formula] value at the minimal point of Qpolar that in the case of circular and parabolic orbits,

[formula]

otherwise,

[formula]

One may infer from this result that the value of Qpolar is monotonically increasing with respect to [formula] (and has a point of inflection at [formula] for circular and parabolic orbits).

The Schwarzschild limiting case.

The analysis of these formulae in the case where [formula] is an important test. An examination of the analytical formulae for Qswitch (equation ([\ref=eq:Q_switch_SBH])), QX (equation ([\ref=eq:Q_Abutment])), and Qpolar (equation ([\ref=eq:Q_polar_physical])), show that when S̃ = 0, all three formulae equal

[formula]

In the Schwarzschild limit, we find that the abutment and the set of polar orbits approach one another, as required by the spherical symmetry of Schwarzschild spacetime.

The Analysis of the Carter Constant for an Evolving Orbit

Introduction

We shall now perform an analysis of the evolution of Q in Kerr spacetime in the domain, which is defined by the three Q curves we have derived (QLSO, QX, Qpolar) in equations ([\ref=eq:Q_LSO]), ([\ref=eq:Q_Abutment]), and ([\ref=eq:Q_polar_physical]). The behaviour of Qswitch (equation ([\ref=eq:Q_switch])) will not be considered here, although it is important in guiding the choice of sign in [formula].

The three equations for QX, QLSO, and Qpolar define a map (see Figure [\ref=fig:The-three-important]) from which one might infer the characteristics of a path followed by an inclined orbit as it evolves. These paths (Qpath) fall into two families: one governed by X2- and the other by X2+. We conjecture that paths in the same family never cross; therefore, if Qpath reaches QX, then it can do so only once. Let us concentrate on the behaviour of an evolving orbit at the abutment, which is where, Qpath, may change from one family to the other. Therefore there are two modes to consider:

[formula]

and

[formula]

The mode represented by equation ([\ref=eq:Mode_Fast]) corresponds to a rapid listing rate, where prograde orbits can cross Qpolar and intersect QX. The mode represented by equation ([\ref=eq:Mode_Slow]) corresponds to orbits that: list at a slow rate, have constant ι, or exhibit decreasing ι over time. And a prograde orbit cannot reach QX since QX lies on the retrograde side of Qpolar.

For this paper we will consider the evolution of a circular orbit (e = 0) because we wish to limit our initial analysis to the relationship between Q and [formula]. Elliptical orbits will be treated in a forthcoming paper [\cite=2011arXiv1101.0996K].

The Evolutionary Path in the Q - [formula] Plane

In Figure [\ref=fig:The-three-important] one may imagine a path, Qpath, that starts at a large value of [formula] as both Q and [formula] monotonically decrease with respect to time. If the curve reaches QX then it must intersect it tangentially (as the zone above the QX curve is inaccessible). It is at that point that the orbit ceases to be governed by X2∓ and is governed by X2±.

At the abutment, [formula] and ∂Q  /  ∂e can be calculated analytically (see Appendix B) irrespective of the model used to determine the radiation back reaction. Given an [formula] and [formula] that have been derived according to some independent model, then according to a linear approximation one may define

[formula]

For a circular orbit (e = 0) it has been proven that [formula] [\cite=1996PhRvD..53.4319K]; therefore, the second term in equation ([\ref=eq:Q_dot]) is zero.

A Preliminary Test at the Abutment.

Because we can perform an analytical calculation of [formula] at the abutment, we can estimate [formula] viz. equation ([\ref=eq:Q_dot]),

[formula]

if the 2PN Q flux (see equation (A.3) in [\cite=2007PhRvD..76d4007B] (after equation (56) in [\cite=2006PhRvD..73f4037G])) is known, i.e.

[formula]

where the functions [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula] are listed in Appendix B (the Carter constant, Q, has been normalised by dividing by [formula]). We performed test calculations on circular orbits of [formula] with KBH spin [formula], which correspond to those used by Hughes [\cite=PhysRevD.61.084004]. In table [\ref=tab:l_dot_compared_to_Hughes], we compare our results with those of Hughes to find that they are reasonably consistent, with some deviation for S̃ = 0.95 and [formula]. We have adjusted the results in Hughes by dividing them by [formula] (where [formula]) so that they will correspond to our near-polar orbits; but this is only an approximation since ι appears in other terms in equation ([\ref=eq:Qdot_2PN]).

The analysis of ι on the abutment

The analysis of ι and its derivatives with respect to [formula] and e will be treated in detail in a forthcoming paper [\cite=2011arXiv1101.0996K]; but it is appropriate to present a short preliminary exploration here.

Unlike Q2PN (which appears in equation ([\ref=eq:Qdot_2PN])), QX contains no explicit variable, ι; therefore, for circular orbits this property greatly simplifies the total derivative of QX with respect to [formula] since ∂QX  /  ∂ι = 0, i.e.

[formula]

Therefore equation ([\ref=eq:Qx_Total_Derivative]) demonstrates that ∂ι  /  ∂ is not constrained on the abutment in the same way as ∂Q / ∂ (see section [\ref=sub:A-Preliminary-Test]). Consider equations ([\ref=eq:Q_Abutment]), ([\ref=eq:X2]), ([\ref=eq:E4]), and ([\ref=eq:Theta-Roots-Equatorial]). They form a calculation sequence, which on the abutment creates a one to one mapping, QX  →  ι; otherwise, there are two possible values of ι for a given value of Q. Thus ∂ι  /  ∂ can be found either by numerical methods or analytically [\cite=2011arXiv1101.0996K]. In the remainder of this section we shall investigate the behaviour of ∂ι  /  ∂ for orbits on the abutment.

Numerical Analysis of ι on the abutment

We can numerically estimate the change of ι with respect to [formula] at the abutment by first finding the change in Q for an extrapolation of the evolving orbit's path (Qpath). Because both Qpath  =  QX and ∂Qpath  /  ∂  =  ∂QX  /  ∂ at the point where Qpath intersects QX, the equations of the second-order extrapolation of Qpath at the abutment can be written as

[formula]

These equations are used to calculate ι- (associated with [formula]) and ι+ ([formula]), where [formula] is the small amount (10- 32) by which we extrapolate from the value of [formula] at which QX and Qpath intersect. Equations ([\ref=eq:Second_Order_Extrapolation_Equations_a]) and ([\ref=eq:Second_Order_Extrapolation_Equations_b]) include the second derivative of Qpath with respect to [formula], which warrants further analysis.

Because [formula] is so small we used MATLAB, set to a precision of 256 digits, to perform the numerical analysis. From these extrapolated values of Qpath we obtain

[formula]

N.B.: Since ι increases as [formula] decreases (with respect to time), [formula].

The first-order extrapolation.

Consider a first-order linear approximation, in which we drop the second derivatives in equations ([\ref=eq:Second_Order_Extrapolation_Equations_a]) and ([\ref=eq:Second_Order_Extrapolation_Equations_b]). The derivation of the corresponding change in ι requires a sequence of calculations to be performed, which we will briefly outline.

Specify the spin (S̃) of the KBH.

Select the values of [formula] and e for the point of intersection with the abutment. For this work, e = 0.

Calculate QX using equation ([\ref=eq:Q_Abutment]) and [formula] using equation ([\ref=eq:Appendix_D_dQXdl]) (given in Appendix B).

Calculate [formula] using equation ([\ref=eq:LSO_Abutment]). It must be smaller than the value of [formula] specified in point ([\ref=enu:Select-the-values]) otherwise the test-particle would be placed beyond the LSO.

Calculate the values of [formula] and [formula] according to a prescribed estimate or extrapolation at [formula].

Calculate X- and X+(equation ([\ref=eq:X2])) from [formula] (We use [formula] and we must use [formula] if [formula]).

Calculate X+ and X- from [formula].

Using equation ([\ref=eq:E4]), calculate the orbital energies (Ẽ) for each of [formula] and [formula].

Now that the values of X+, X-, Ẽ, [formula] are known; the value of ι (ι- and ι+) can be calculated viz. equation ([\ref=eq:Theta-Roots-Equatorial]). We use the expression, [formula].

We can estimate [formula] viz. equation ([\ref=eq:diotabydl_numerical]).

We have performed this sequence of first-order calculations for each mode (equations ([\ref=eq:Mode_Fast]) and ([\ref=eq:Mode_Slow])) over a range of S̃ and [formula] values; and a representative set is shown in table [\ref=tab:The-overestimated-values]. The slow and fast modes yield [formula] values that are of opposite sign; and these results might suggest that the slow mode corresponds to orbits for which ∂ι  /  ∂t < 0. But let us first assess the validity of the first-order approximation by testing it in the Schwarzschild limit. The results for small S̃ (table [\ref=tab:The-overestimated-values]) demonstrate that this approximation is incomplete since it produces a non-zero result for [formula], which is unphysical. On each side of the abutment, the value of Qpath is underestimated. This observation warrants the study of a more complete model that includes the higher derivatives of Qpath. Indeed, we have found that using [formula] alone cannot offer a sufficiently accurate mathematical description of the orbital evolution at the abutment and warrants the development of second and higher derivatives of Qpath. One reasonably expects this numerical method to produce an accurate estimate of [formula]; but the transition an orbit makes at the abutment from X2∓ to X2± makes its behaviour more complicated.

The second-order extrapolation.

Equations ([\ref=eq:Second_Order_Extrapolation_Equations_a]) and ([\ref=eq:Second_Order_Extrapolation_Equations_b]) provide a second-order approximation of Qpath in the vicinity of the point of tangential intersection between QX and Qpath. At this formative stage of our work with the abutment, we will use [formula] (see equation ([\ref=eq:Appendix_D_d2QXdl2]) in Appendix B) in place of [formula] in equations ([\ref=eq:Second_Order_Extrapolation_Equations_a]) and ([\ref=eq:Second_Order_Extrapolation_Equations_b]) as an approximation. We repeated the ten-point sequence of calculations for the slow mode (equation ([\ref=eq:Mode_Slow])), as outlined in section [\ref=sub:The-first-order-extrapolation]. The results of this numerical analysis are included in table [\ref=tab:The-overestimated-values]. We observe that as [formula], [formula], as required. Further, the second-order [formula] results for the slow mode represent listing orbits (i.e. [formula]); therefore, the maximum list rate associated with paths that change from X2+  ⇒  X2- (slow) at the abutment will have an upper limit that corresponds to the minimal value of [formula] for that mode.

The calculation of [formula].

Let us consider the use of the QX curve itself to estimate the value of [formula] of an evolving orbit as it intersects the abutment. In this case,

[formula]

where we have assumed that the path followed by the evolving orbit locally matches the QX curve (equations ([\ref=eq:Exact_Extrapolation_Equations_a]) and ([\ref=eq:Exact_Extrapolation_Equations_b]) that are used in point [\ref=enu:Use-equations]). This analysis yields the minimum value of [formula] at [formula] for a KBH spin, S̃, as specified in point ([\ref=enu:Specify-the-spin]). For the slow mode, the rate of change of ι can be no smaller. If Qpath deviates from QX in its second and higher derivatives, then the actual value of [formula] will be greater than [formula].

Analysis.

In table [\ref=tab:The-overestimated-values] the values of [formula] are in good agreement with the second-order calculations; although a difference is evident for S̃  =  10- 6.

We calculated [formula] for various KBH spins ([formula]) over a wide range of orbit sizes ([formula]). It was noted that the results for very large orbits were described well by an equation of the form

[formula]

and that κ1 and ρ can be found by performing a least squares fit on [formula]. For orbits closer to the LSO, we find that

[formula]

In Figure [\ref=fig:Change-in-angle-VL-l], [formula] data for the range [formula] are shown on a log-log plot. By linear regression analysis, its asymptotic behaviour (f2.5) can be found (see table [\ref=tab:Coeff-and-Powers]). In successive steps each power of [formula] in the series can be derived as the higher powers are subtracted from the original numerical data-set. A linear relationship between [formula] and S̃ is found for f2.5 and f3.5; but for f4.5 and f5.5, which cover ranges of [formula] closer to the LSO, an S̃3 term appears. The correlation coefficients (r2) of these regression analyses were better than 99.9999%.

One may find the specific mode that applies at the abutment by comparing the results in the first line of table [\ref=tab:Coeff-and-Powers] with the weak-field radiation-reaction post-Newtonian results available in the literature. Consider the quotient of the formulae presented in equation (3.9) of Hughes [\cite=PhysRevD.61.084004] where [formula].

[formula]

An identical first-order result can also be derived from equation (4.3) in Ganz [\cite=2007PThPh.117.1041G]. Equation ([\ref=eq:Weak-RR]) is of the same form as equation ([\ref=eq:didl_power_weak_RR]). Because - 61 / 48 >  - 4.5 in the weak-field radiation-reaction regime, one may consider X2+  ⇒  X2- to be the pertinent mode. Therefore [formula] describes the lower limit of [formula] for all [formula]. By numerical analysis, we found

[formula]

In Table [\ref=tab:iota_dot_compared_to_Hughes], we compare the results of equation ([\ref=eq:didl_Laurent]) with those of Hughes [\cite=PhysRevD.61.084004]; and although they differ, it is confirmed that the listing of an inclined orbit in a KBH system proceeds by the slow method. As before (Table [\ref=tab:l_dot_compared_to_Hughes]) we adjust the results in [\cite=PhysRevD.61.084004] by dividing them by [formula] so that they will correspond approximately to our near-polar orbits. Although we use equation ([\ref=eq:Theta-Roots-Equatorial]) to calculate the value of ι in this work, and this differs from the formula used in [\cite=2002PhRvD..66f4005G] [\cite=2006PhRvD..73f4037G]; we recognise that they are sufficiently similar for us to make a general inference about the relative sizes of ∂ι  /  ∂t in [\cite=PhysRevD.61.084004] and those calculated here.

Figure [\ref=fig:Contours-of-constant-Q] shows the contours of constant Q on an   -  ι plane for circular orbits (e = 0) about a KBH of spin S̃ = 0.99. One of the important features of dι / d on the abutment is the suggestion of a coordinate singularity (dι / d  →    ∞  ); but this is for the specialized case in which the orbit evolves with a constant value of Q. It has been confirmed that ∂Q / ∂ > 0 on the abutment (see Section [\ref=sub:A-Preliminary-Test]); hence, such a singularity for the dι / d of an evolving orbit is not physically manifested. The arrows labelled (a), (b), (c), and (d) show some important examples of how ∂ι  /  ∂ can vary at the abutment. One observes that ∂ι  /  ∂ is not uniquely fixed by ∂Q / ∂. Nevertheless, Figure [\ref=fig:Contours-of-constant-Q] provides an important picture of the behaviour of ι as the orbit tangentially intersects the abutment; and it warrants further study.

Conclusions

In our study of inclined elliptical orbits about a Kerr black hole (KBH), we found that the minus form of X2± ([formula]) is shifted away from the polar orbit position to encompass near-polar retrograde orbits. The abutment (which is a set of orbits that lie at the junction between the minus and plus forms of X2±) is shifted the greatest near to the LSO of the KBH and asymptotically becomes more polar with increasing latus rectum ([formula]) .

We developed a set of analytical formulae that characterise the behaviour of the Carter constant (Q) at the last stable orbit (LSO), abutment, and polar orbit. Further, the curves that describe Q for an LSO and Q at the abutment (between the minus and plus forms of X2±) intersect at a single tangential point, for which we derived an analytical formula. From these equations one can define the domain of Q for an evolving orbit (Qpath). The two families of curves defined by Qpath are governed by either X2+ or X2-; and the curves within each family never cross. Therefore, at the abutment, Qpath can either change from X2-  ⇒  X2+ or from X2+  ⇒  X2-. This result aids in the investigation of the listing of an orbit at the abutment.

We have used the abutment as an analytical and numerical laboratory for the study of the evolution of Q for inclined circular orbits. The first derivative of QX with respect to [formula] ([formula]) allows us to test the consistency of 2PN Q fluxes with estimated values of [formula]. Further. by converting Q to the angle of orbital inclination (ι), it was possible to calculate the minimum rate of change of ι with respect to [formula], [formula], independently of a radiation back reaction model. Comparison with published weak-field post-Newtonian results show that the X2+  ⇒  X2- mode applies; and this mode must apply to the entire range of orbit size, [formula].

Although QX and [formula] are important, the higher derivatives also display critical behaviour. The second derivatives of Qpath warrant more study as it will improve our understanding to the effect of the radiation back reaction on the listing behaviour of the orbit. The analysis of elliptical orbits at the abutment will introduce new elements to the listing behaviour, which arise from the first derivative of QX and the second and higher derivatives of Qpath, both with respect to e. Such a result might be valuable in our understanding of current and future radiation back reaction models.

Appendix C: An explicit treatment of [formula] in the effective potential

For the sake of completeness, we shall demonstrate a method for calculating a polynomial that describes dθ  /  dτ.

Recall that:

Therefore one may consider a normalised form of these equations:

N.B.:

[formula]

In working with the quantity, dr  /  dτ, in [\cite=Komorowski:2008wc] it did not matter about the division of the radial distance by the black hole mass, M, since the proper time, τ, would also have been normalised in the same way i.e.,

[formula]

Indeed, one ought to consider the normalisation of the proper time with respect to black hole mass. Although one could escape difficulties when only considering dr  /  dτ, it is mandatory that the normalised proper time be explicitly considered when evaluating the quantity, dθ  /  dτ. The polar angle, θ, is already dimensionless, and as such cannot be normalised. Therefore

[formula]

We may rewrite the 4-momentum in terms of dθ  /  d in addition to dR  /  d, where [formula].

[formula]

By evaluating [formula] and substituting the known relation for dR  /  d one obtains,
