Self-Contact and Instabilities in the Anisotropic Growth of Elastic Membranes

Growing membranes are ubiquitous in living matter, producing a very rich variety of complex shapes. In an attempt to sustain external loads and to minimize internal stresses, structures adopt new shapes. Non-uniform or restrained growth of surfaces inevitably leads to out of plane buckling. This can be evidenced in many examples such as the development of the folds of Mitochondria, the formation of plant leaves, the wrinkling of human skin or, in two dimensions, the packing of rod-like objects [\cite=nstoop].

Flat discs growing under various conditions have received intense attention recently from experimental [\cite=sharon1] [\cite=sharon2] and theoretical sides [\cite=santangelo] [\cite=julien] [\cite=mmm]. Santangelo [\cite=santangelo] presented a theoretical study to explain experiments on radially symmetric, isotropic growth of polymers with different swelling factors [\cite=sharon1] [\cite=sharon2]. In Dervaux et al. [\cite=julien], potato-chip like shapes were found for anisotropic, circumferential growth using modified Föppl-von Kàrmàn equations [\cite=julien2]. This description is however only valid for small deformations and was extended in Ref. [\cite=mmm] to large deformations in the limit of vanishing thickness. It was found that circumferential growth is equivalent to inserting a wedge into the disk, leading to so-called excess cones or "e-cones". They are characterized by an excess angle φe which is the angle of the wedge added to the disc. With increasing φe, the symmetric e-cone will eventually touch itself simultaneously with two perpendicular contact planes. From that situation on, the authors of Ref. [\cite=mmm] made the assumption that the e-cone remains symmetric, and derived the corresponding bending energy.

In this Letter, we show that this assumption is not correct when φe is above a critical value. Instead, by taking surface self-contact into account, a family of new shapes emerges, namely skewed e-cone solutions with a varying contact plane angle. Our results are obtained from a sophisticated numerical thin shell model capable of capturing large deformation and growth. We find the energetically most favorable shapes, discuss the dependence of stable morphologies on shell thickness, and highlight the analogy between disk and ring growth.

The mechanics of thin discs is well described by the classical Kirchhoff-Love model. It follows by expansion of the full 3d elastic problem in the thickness h, and by assuming negligible transverse shear through the thickness [\cite=landau_lifshitz] [\cite=benamarpomeau] [\cite=friesecke]. The elastic energy is then entirely given by the deformation of the disc's middle-surface Ω, and contains a stretching and a bending part:

[formula]

Here, Y is the elastic modulus, ν Poisson's ratio and dΩ the infinitesimal area element. The stretching and bending energy densities Us and Ub are given by

[formula]

εij denote the in-plane strains and κij the components of the curvature tensor. The first term in Ub is the squared mean curvature, while the second term accounts for Gaussian curvature. Without growth, ε  =  1 / 2(FTF  -  1), where [formula] is the deformation gradient of the map χ that transforms from the reference to the deformed configuration, see e.g. Ref. [\cite=ogden]. Growth is added by decomposing F multiplicatively into F  =  AG [\cite=rodrigues] [\cite=goriely]. G is the growth tensor describing the change of mass and A is the elastic tensor that ensures compatibility (no overlap) and continuity (no cavitation) of the body. We further assume: (i) Growth is slow compared to the elastic timescale, which is typically true in nature [\cite=goriely]. Thus, the disc is always in elastic equilibrium. (ii) There exists a stress-free reference state, i.  e. the flat disc with [formula]. (iii) The elastic response depends only on A. The in-plane strains then become ε  =  1 / 2(ATA - 1) and κ is modified similarly. In the present model, we only consider surface expansion, i.  e., the thickness remains constant. In terms of the excess angle φe, G in polar coordinates then becomes

[formula]

We search for configurations that minimize Eq. ([\ref=energy]) by discretizing the system using the finite element method. The curvature integral in Eq. ([\ref=energy]) requires at least continuity of first derivatives. To this end, we employ a recently developed method based on C1-continuous subdivision finite elements (SDFEs) [\cite=cirak]. From the discrete Lagrangian formulation of Eq. ([\ref=energy]) the elastic forces [formula] are derived for all mesh nodes i, and the equations of motion are integrated in time. For numerical stability and equilibration, we add an external viscous damping term of the form [formula] to the equations of motion, with [formula] the velocity of node i. η was chosen subcritical for all vibration modes and did not have influence on the results. To validate our model, we use the non-linear ABAQUS software package with implicit solver and 4 node general shell elements (S4) including transverse shear [\cite=abaqus]. Contact is modeled in ABAQUS via surface-surface contact and a linear force law while in our implementation, point-triangle contacts are subject to a quadratic repulsion force. Note that in tangential direction contacts are frictionless unless explicitly mentioned.

The simulation starts from a flat disc with constant thickness h, with h between 0.001 and 0.04. The excess angle φe is increased in small steps by expanding all elements in the tangential direction of a centered cylindrical material coordinate system. Assuming slow growth, the equilibrium solution is obtained after every such step (in SDFEs, we wait until the kinetic energy becomes negligible). In SDFE simulations a small vertical random noise is initially imposed on the displacements to break the planar symmetry of the flat disk. In ABAQUS, this is automatically provided by numerical noise. In dynamic simulations via ABAQUS, we first observe high buckling modes of the e-cone type, and for h small enough even superimposed radial buckles. Due to the bending rigidity these soon damp out into the lowest energy mode with two folds (n=2), having a shape similar to a potato chip as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig1] (a). The growth continues stable in the n=2 mode. The analytical solution predicts contact between the two folds at [formula] [\cite=mmm]. We find excellent numerical agreement, with the first contact occurring between [formula] for h = 0.04, and [formula] for h = 0.001.

The analytical solution suggests an increase in bending energy up to the theoretical value of the solution with three wings (n=3), followed by a transition into this mode [\cite=mmm]. We obtain a flattening of the contact zones maintaining symmetry in two planes (Fig. [\ref=fig1] (b)). Shortly after reaching [formula], however, the contact planes start to counter rotate (Fig. [\ref=fig1] (c)), leading to a reduction of curvature of one wing at the expense of the other. Consequently a skewed e-cone solution with a flat disc-like part and two wings forms as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig1] (d). This transition is obtained for all shell thicknesses considered. If growth continues, we simply keep on adding additional windings to both sides of the flattened region. In the following we address the nature of the transition, the composition of elastic energies, and their dependence on system parameters.

The analytical results in Ref. [\cite=mmm] are based on discs with vanishing thickness. As a consequence, the e-cone shape has zero Gaussian curvature everywhere, except at the point-like apex. By introducing a finite thickness, it is intuitively clear that the singularity at the apex will be flattened in order to reduce bending energy and because the maximal curvature is bounded by the thickness. Consequently, the Gaussian curvature cannot vanish close to the apex leading to local stretching. We call this region the core of the e-cone and denote its radius by Rc. We numerically calculated the e-cone equilibrium solutions for different thicknesses and excess angles and found that [formula], a behavior similar to the core size scaling of developable cones reported in [\cite=benamarpomeau] [\cite=witten] [\cite=cerda]. In Fig. [\ref=fig3] we show the rescaled bending energy [formula], where A is the total area of the e-cone . The figure shows that the bending energy is indeed strongly reduced for thick shells. To quantify the convergence towards the analytical solution, we consider the excess angle [formula] where Êb reaches its maximum. We find that [formula] converges to the analytical maximum φ*e = 2.57 according to [formula] with [formula] (Fig. [\ref=fig3], inset).

For the n = 2 mode at [formula], the wings touch and eventually form a skewed e-cone. In order to analyze the stability of the symmetric solution, we performed two types of simulations: First, we "stabilized" the symmetric solution using static friction between the areas in contact and increased φe to 10. This way, we can fix the e-cone solution, which would be unstable without friction. At φe = 10, the contact friction was removed and the system relaxed towards the skewed e-cone. We then followed the skewed solution by decreasing the excess angle from φe = 10 back to [formula]. During this procedure, we measured the bending energy, which is the relevant part of the total energy, shown in Fig. [\ref=fig4]. We note that in the range of φe investigated, the next higher n = 3 mode (dotted line) is energetically above the symmetric e-cone (bold line), despite the fact that it is a configuration that does not involve any contact (for n = 3, the wings would touch only for φe = 13.3). Fig. [\ref=fig4] furthermore shows that above a critical [formula], the skewed solution provides the lowest energy, whereas the symmetric e-cone is favored in the regime [formula]. The influence of the finite disc thickness on the energy and stability is illustrated in the inset of Fig. [\ref=fig4]. Remarkably, even though [formula] is practically identical for all thicknesses considered, we find a significant dependence of [formula] on h (black dots).

Finding the minimum of the nonlinear problem posed by Eq. ([\ref=energy]) with self-contact is nontrivial and numerically delicate. We therefore compared our numerical findings to experiments by measuring the angle γ between the touching planes (cf. Fig. [\ref=fig1]) for h=0.005. In simulations, this was done by averaging over the contact forces in each of the two contact zones, resulting in an approximation for the contact plane normals from which the angle γ is obtained. Experimentally, we used two layers of paper glued together to obtain a homogenous bending stiffness. The angle was obtained from digital camera images taken from the top view of the e-cone. The results in Fig. [\ref=fig5] (left) show good agreement of simulations and experiments, confirming the validity of the model ([\ref=energy]) and the numerical equilibrium solution.

Moreover, for values of φe > 10 the skewed e-cone solution approaches a shape which can be approximated by a flat disk with two connecting loops (see Fig. [\ref=fig1] d). Both loops put together are described remarkably well by the symmetric free e-cone shown in Fig. [\ref=fig1] a: From the shape equations of the symmetric e-cone it can be derived that for φe  =  3.73, the tangent in the points [formula] of vanishing curvature is perpendicular to the plane in which the [formula] lie. These points are in fact equivalent to the points of contact of the skewed e-cone. The described approximation yields an estimate for the bending energy. One obtains for a skewed e-cone with excess angle [formula]: [formula]. In Fig. [\ref=fig5] (right), we plot the ratio of the two energies [formula], which is indeed close to the predicted value (solid line). Understandably, the quality of the approximation decreases with larger h, as the change in bending energy of the e-cone core region is not taken into account.

We finally turn to the study of rings with inner radius Ri. The same simulation procedure was applied with fixed thickness h = 0.02. We found that rings, like discs, loose stability after contact occurs and attain the skewed solution shown in Fig. [\ref=fig6]. Interestingly, [formula] strongly depends on Ri, as shown in Table [\ref=table1]. In terms of energy and stability, rings behave similar to discs.

We presented a realistic simulation of circumferential growth of discs and rings with finite thickness. By including self-contact, asymmetric, skewed morphologies, that were not predicted by previous analytical solutions, emerge and stabilize for sufficient growth. By energetical arguments based on symmetric deformation modes, we showed, that the asymmetric mode has lower bending energy, and is therefore preferred. Moreover, we found that tangentially growing rings of various widths behave analogous to discs. Good agreement with experiments suggests that the skewed solutions are energetically optimal, but a rigorous proof remains an open question. The asymmetries arising from circumferential growth disclosed in the present work constitutes a novel step in understanding the shapes of membranes and sheets. One can generalize our work to non-linear material behavior and stress or strain dependent growth laws in order to tune to more specific applications in Nature.
