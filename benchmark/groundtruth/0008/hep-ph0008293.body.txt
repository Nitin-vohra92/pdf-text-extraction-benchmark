Abstract

The light-front (LF) quantization [\cite=ref:a] of QCD in light-cone (l.c.) gauge is discussed. The Dirac method is employed to construct the LF Hamiltonian and theory quantized canonically. The Dyson-Wick perturbation theory expansion based on LF-time ordering is constructed. The framework incorporates in it simultaneously the Lorentz gauge condition as an operator equation as well. The propagator of the dynamical ψ+ part of the free fermionic propagator is shown to be causal while the gauge field propagator is found to be transverse. The interaction Hamiltonian is re-expressed in the form closely resembling the one in covariant theory, except for additional instantaneous interactions, which can be treated systematically. Some explicit computations in QCD are given.

Introduction

The quantization of relativistic field theory at fixed light-front time [formula], was proposed by Dirac [\cite=dir] half a century ago. It has found important applications [\cite=bro] [\cite=bpp] [\cite=ken] [\cite=pre] in gauge theory and string theory. The light-front (LF) quantization of QCD in its Hamiltonian form provides an alternative approach to lattice gauge theory for the computation of nonperturbative quantities. We discuss here [\cite=lcg] the LF quantization of QCD gauge field theory in l.c. gauge employing the Dyson-Wick S-matrix expansion based on LF-time-ordered products. The case of covariant gauge has been discussed in our earlier work [\cite=cov].

QCD action in light-cone gauge

The LF coordinates are defined as [formula], where [formula] are the transverse coordinates and   μ =  - , + ,1,2. The coordinate [formula] will be taken as the LF time, while x- is the longitudinal spatial coordinate.

The quantum action of QCD in l.c. gauge is described in the standard notation by

[formula]

Here [formula] are anticommuting ghost fields and auxiliary fields Ba(x) are introduced in the linear gauge-fixing term. The action is invariant under BRS symmetry transformations. Since Ba carries canonical dimension three no quadratic terms in them are permitted.

Spinor field propagator on the LF

The quark field term in LF coordinates reads

[formula]

where [\cite=cov] ψ ±   =  Λ±ψ. This shows that the minus components ψ - j are in fact nondynamical fields without kinetic terms. Their equations of motion in l.c. gauge lead to the constraint equations

[formula]

The free field propagator of ψ+ is determined from the quadratic terms (suppressing the color index) [formula] where [formula]. The equation of motion for the independent component ψ+ is nonlocal in the longitudinal direction. In the quantized theory we find the following nonvanishing local anticommutator [formula]. They may be realized in momentum space through the following Fourier transform [\cite=cov]

[formula]

where

[formula]

and the nonvanishing anticommutation relations are given by: {b(r)(p),b†(s)(p')} [formula].

The free propagator then follows to be [\cite=cov]

[formula]

It is causal and contains no instantaneous term.

Gauge field propagator in l.c. gauge

In the l.c. gauge the ghost fields decouple and it is sufficient to study the free abelian gauge theory with the action

[formula]

where Fμν  =   (∂μAν  -  ∂νAμ). Following the Dirac procedure we show that the phase space constraints remove all the canonical momenta from the theory. The surviving variables are [formula] and A+. The latter, however, is a dependent variable satisfying [formula]. The construction of the Dirac bracket shows that in the l.c. gauge on the LF we simultaneously obtain the Lorentz condition ∂  ·  A = 0 as an operator equation as well. The reduced Hamiltonian is found to be [formula]

The equal-τ commutators are

[formula]

[formula] δ3(k - k'). The free gluon propagator is hence found to be [\cite=lcg]

[formula]

with nμ  =  δμ+, [formula], kμDμν(k) = 0, nμDμν(k) = 0.

QCD Hamiltonian in l.c. gauge

The interaction Hamiltonian in the l.c. gauge, Aa- = 0, may be rewritten [\cite=lcg] as

[formula]

where [formula] and a sum over distinct flavours, not written explicitly, is to be understood.

The fact that gluons have only physical degrees of freedom in l.c. gauge may provide an analysis of coupling renormalization similar to that of the pinch technique, which is currently being discussed [\cite=pinch] in order to obtain a shorter expansion and scheme for QCD. In addition, the couplings of gluons in the l.c. gauge provides a simple procedure for the factorization of soft and hard gluonic corrections in high momentum transfer inclusive and exclusive reactions.
