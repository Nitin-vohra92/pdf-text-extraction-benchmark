Introduction

The behaviour of 2D electrons in a spatially nonuniform magnetic field is of interest in various aspects. The simplest situation is one-dimensional inhomogeneity when the normal component of the magnetic field Bz varies only in one direction, say Bz(y). M[formula]ller [\cite=1] has considered the ballistic regime of a 2D electronic system for a special case Bz(y) = B0ky and for the geometry when the current flows in the x-direction perpendicularly to the magnetic field gradient. Numerical solution of the Schr[formula]dinger equation carried out in [\cite=1] gives the current distribution in the y-direction jx(y). Nonzero values of jx(y) (without electric field) arise because the Landau degeneracy is lifted in the inhomogeneous magnetic field and the eigenstates become current-carrying. Of course, the total current [formula] equals zero in the absence of the electric field (the case with electric field has not been considered in [\cite=1]).

In the present paper I will consider the classical magnetotransport for which the local relation between the current density [formula] and the electric field [formula] is valid

[formula]

where α,β label the Cartesian components of the magnetoconductivity tensor σ̂. The inhomogeneity is supposed to be one-dimensional (in y-direction) but both possible geometries of the experiments ([formula] and [formula] Oy) will be considered. In the geometry of ref. [\cite=1] [formula] the exact analytical (and quite simple) solution is possible for an arbitrary dependence σ̂(y), including the case of nonuniform magnetic field. In the other geometry [formula] the exact analytical (and rather unexpected) result is obtained for the M[formula]ller model Bz = B0ky: there exists specific static skin-effect when the current density exponentially depends on the transversal coordinate x.

In both cases I will consider a specimen in the form of a strip of finite width and infinite length. The total current J is fixed (measured by ampermeter) while the electric field components Ex and Ey are to be found from the equations ([\ref=1]) and

[formula]

In such a positioning of the problem one does not need to solve the Poisson equation.

Current perpendicular to the direction of inhomogeneity

The system of equations ([\ref=1]) and ([\ref=2]) written in the components reads:

[formula]

where σ0  =  σxx  =  σyy, σ1  =  σxy.

Look for the solution with [formula]. Strictly speaking one needs the solution with jy(y = 0) = jy(y = L) = 0, where L is the width of the strip. However due to the evident unicity of the solution the assumption made does not violate the generality. Then we have:

[formula]

where ραβ is the magnetoresistance tensor, ρ0  =  ρxx. Further:

[formula]

with [formula].

The general solution of eq. ([\ref=5]) has a form

[formula]

It follows from eq. ([\ref=4])

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

The fixed total current determines the value A:

[formula]

and the problem is solved. The Hall voltage defined as Φ(x,0) - Φ(x,L) equals

[formula]

and one gets the following expression for the effective Hall resistance

[formula]

where the brackets mean averaging over y:

[formula]

The diagonal component of ρeffαβ is

[formula]

that simply corresponds to the parallel connection of conducting filaments stretched along the current direction.

The eqs. ([\ref=11]) and ([\ref=13]) are valid for any kind of a one-dimensional inhomogeneity (e.g. carrier concentration, magnetic field, the density of scatterers). If the specimen is homogeneous and only magnetic field depends on y the relations hold between σ0 and σ1:

[formula]

following from the classical Drude kinetic theory; σ is the Drude conductivity for B = 0. Then ρeff1  =  〈ρ1〉 that corresponds to the sequential connection of the Hall voltages created by the magnetic field in each conducting filament parallel to Ox. Thus, in the geometry considered in this section, for a homogeneous specimen and inhomogeneous magnetic field the results are quite trivial:

[formula]

Note that for an inhomogeneous specimen, instead of the second relation of eq. ([\ref=15]), a more complicate result ([\ref=11]) is valid.

Current parallel to the magnetic field gradient.

Consider now a strip parallel to Oy and look for the solution with [formula]. The specimen is supposed to be homogeneous, the local values σ0(y) and σ1(y) are determined by the classical kinetic theory:

[formula]

Then from eqs. ([\ref=3]) with jx = 0 one can easily obtain:

[formula]

where the last relation in eq. ([\ref=17]) follows again from jx = 0. Hence,

[formula]

and for the M[formula]ller model B(y) = B0ky the solution has a form

[formula]

From eq. ([\ref=19]) one obtains

[formula]

where the constant C can be found via the total current:

[formula]

The Hall voltage:

[formula]

and the Hall resistance in the point y is

[formula]

where ρ = 1 / σ, τ is relaxation time and ωc(y) is the local value of the cyclotron frequency: ωc(y)τ  =  λB(y). The most remarkable feature of the obtained solution is the exponential distribution of the current density along the x-direction (see eq. ([\ref=20])). This can be called the static skin-effect. Depending on the signs of J, B0 and k the current in y-direction is concentrated either at the left (x = 0) or at the right (x=L) edge of the strip. The depth of the skin layer ls is defined by the magnetic field gradient: ls = 1 / kωc0τ, where ωc0 is the cyclotron frequency for B = B0. The electric field depends also exponentially on the transversal coordinate. Hence, when measuring the Hall voltage VH between the left edge of the strip x = 0 and some variable point x (for the same y!) inside the strip one will find the exponential dependence VH(x) that would be an experimental evidence of the skin-effect.

Alternate electric field.

The above obtained results can be easily extended to the case of finite frequency ω of the electric field if ω <  < 1 / τM, where τM is the Maxwell relaxation time. For the 3D situation 1 / τM = 4πσ3D and for 2D 1 / τM = 2πσ2D / L. The parameter ωτ can be of an arbitrary magnitude. By making use of the well known formulae for σαβ(B) allowing for the dispersion one can easily see that it is necessary just to substitute

[formula]

in all the preceeding formulae. For example, the Hall voltage between the points (o, y) and (x, y) reads

[formula]

Thus the voltage and the current density decay with oscillations when the distance from the strip edge increases.

How to realize the linearly nonuniform magnetic field.

Here I consider only the case of a 2D system. As 2D electrons "feel" only the normal component of the magnetic field Bn the inhomogeneity of Bn can be achieved for a thin conducting film bent to a proper shape and placed in a uniform field [formula]. The dependence Bn(y) = B0ky is realized for the cylindrical surface z = F(y), where

[formula]

In conclusion, the exact analytical solutions are obtained for the classical Hall effect in inhomogeneous systems. If the current flows perpendicularly to the inhomogeneity the solution is possible in the quite general form. For the parallel orientation of the current and magnetic field gradient the analytical solution is found for the linearly inhomogeneous magnetic field. In the latter case the static skin-effect occurs for a specimen in the form of a long strip.
