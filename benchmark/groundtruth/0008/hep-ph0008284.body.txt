The ΔI = 1 / 2 rule and ε' / ε

Difficulties with the Chiral Approach for K  →  ππ

Conventionally the K  →  ππ matrix elements are evaluated under the factorization assumption so that 〈O(μ)〉 is factorized into the product of two matrix elements of single currents, governed by decay constants and form factors. However, the information of the scale and γ5-scheme dependence of 〈O(μ)〉 is lost in the factorization approximation. To implement the scale dependence, it has been advocated that a physical cutoff Λc, which is introduced to regularize the quadratic (and logarithmic) divergence of the long-distance chiral loop corrections to K  →  ππ amplitudes, can be identified with the renormalization scale μ of the Wilson coefficients [\cite=BBG]. However, this chiral approach faces several difficulties: (i) The long-distance evolution of meson loop contributions can only be extended to the scale of order 600 MeV, whereas the perturbative evaluation of Wilson coefficients cannot be reliably evolved down to the scale below 1 GeV. The conventional practice of matching chiral loop corrections to hadronic matrix elements with Wilson coefficient functions at the scale μ = (0.6 - 1.0) GeV requires chiral perturbation theory and/or perturbative QCD be pushed into the regions beyond their applicability. (ii) It is quite unnatural to match the quadratic scale dependence of chiral corrections with logarithmic μ dependence of Wilson coefficients. This means that it is necessary to apply the same renormalization scheme to regularize short-distance c(μ) and long-distance chiral corrections. (iii) It is not clear how to address the issue of γ5-scheme dependence in the chiral approach. (iv) While the inclusion of chiral loops will make a large enhancement for A0, the predicted A2 is still too large compared to experiment. This implies that nonfactorized effects other than chiral loops are needed to explain A2. Therefore, not all the long-distance nonfactorized contributions to hadronic matrix elements are fully accounted for by chiral loops. (v) Finally, this approach based on chiral perturbation theory is not applicable to heavy meson decays. Therefore, it is strongly desirable to describe the nonleptonic decays of kaons and heavy mesons within the same framework.

Generalized Factorization

The scale and scheme problems with naive factorization will not occur in the full amplitude since 〈Q(μ)〉 involves vertex-type and penguin-type corrections to the hadronic matrix elements of the 4-quark operator renormalized at the scale μ. Schematically, weak decay amplitude = naive factorization + vertex-type corrections + penguin-type corrections+spectator contributions+[formula]. where the spectator contributions take into account the gluonic interactions between the spectator quark of the kaon and the outgoing light meson. In general, the scheme- and μ-scale-independent effective Wilson coefficients have the form [\cite=Ali] [\cite=CT98]:

[formula]

For kaon decays under consideration, there is no any heavy quark mass scale between mc and mK. Hence, the logarithmic term emerged in the vertex corrections to 4-quark operators is of the form ln (μf  /  μ). We will set μf = 1 GeV in order to have a reliable estimate of perturbative effects on effective Wilson coefficients. Writing

[formula]

the effective parameters can be rewritten as

[formula]

with χi being nonfactorized terms. Contrary to charmless B decays where χi are short-distance dominated and hence calculable in mb  →    ∞   limit, the nonfactorized effects in kaon decays arise mainly from the soft gluon exchange, implying large nonfactoized corrections to naive factorization.

Since nonfactorized effects in K  →  ππ decays are not calculable by perturbative QCD, it is necessary to make some assumptions. We assume that

[formula]

and χLR  ≠  χLL. As shown in [\cite=Cheng99], the nonfactorized term χLL, assuming to be real, can be extracted from K+  →  π+π0 decay to be χLL =  - 0.73 at μf = 1 GeV. A large negative χLL necessary for suppressing A2 will enhance A0 by a factor of 2. Although no constraints on χLR can be extracted from K0  →  ππ, we find that the ratio A0 / A2 and direct CP violation ε' / ε are not particularly sensitive to the value of χLR [\cite=Cheng00].

K  →  ππ isospin amplitudes

we plot in Fig. 1 the ratio A0 / A2 as a function of ms at the renormalization scale μ = 1 GeV. Specifically, we obtain

[formula]

It is clear that the strange quark mass is favored to be smaller and that the prediction is renormalization scheme independent, as it should be.

It is instructive to see the anatomy of the ΔI = 1 / 2 rule. In the absence of QCD corrections, we have [formula]. With the inclusion of lowest-order short-distance QCD corrections to the Wilson coefficients z1 and z2 evaluated at μ = 1 GeV, A0 / A2 is enhanced from the value of 0.9 to 2.0, and it becomes 2.3 if ms(1  GeV) = 150 MeV and QCD penguin as well as electroweak penguin effects are included. This ratio is suppressed to 1.7 with the inclusion of the isospin-breaking effect, but it is increased again to the value of 2.0 in the presence of final-state interactions with [formula] and [formula]. At this point, we have ReA0 = 7.7  ×  10- 8 GeV and ReA2 = 3.8  ×  10- 8 GeV. Comparing with the experimental values Re  A0 = 3.323  ×  10- 7  GeV,  ~  Re  A2 = 1.497  ×  10- 8  GeV, we see that the conventional calculation based on the effective Hamiltonian and naive factorization predicts a too small ΔI = 1 / 2 amplitude by a factor of 4.3 and a too large ΔI = 3 / 2 amplitude by a factor of 2.5 . In short, it is a long way to go to achieve the ΔI = 1 / 2 rule within the conventional approach. Our analysis indicates that there are two principal sources responsible for the enhancement of ReA0  /  ReA2: the vertex-type as well as penguin-type corrections to the matrix elements of four-quark operators and nonfactorized effect due to soft-gluon exchange, which is needed to suppress the ΔI = 3 / 2 K  →  ππ amplitude.

Direct CP violation ε' / ε

For direct CP violation, we find for Im(VtdV*ts) = (1.29  ±  0.30)  ×  10- 4 (see Fig. 2)

[formula]

at ms(1 GeV)=125 MeV, 150 MeV, 175 MeV, respectively, in the NDR scheme, where the calculations in the HV scheme are shown in parentheses. The theoretical uncertainties of direct CP violation come from the uncertainties of Im(VtdV*ts), ΩIB, and strong phase shifts. Experimentally, the world average including NA31 [\cite=NA31], E731 [\cite=E731], KTeV [\cite=KTeV] and NA48 [\cite=NA48] results is

[formula]

From Fig. 2 we observe that, contrary to the case of A0 / A2, the prediction of ε' / ε shows some scale dependence; roughly speaking, (ε' / ε)NDR  ≈  1.5  (ε' / ε)HV. Direct CP violation involves a large cancellation between the dominant yeff6 and yeff8 terms. The scale dependence of the predicted ε' / ε is traced back to the scale dependence of the effective Wilson coefficient yeff6. It seems to us that the difference between yeff6(NDR) and yeff6(HV) comes from the effects of order α2s, which is further amplified by the strong cancellation between QCD penguin and electroweak penguin contributions, making it difficult to predict ε' / ε accurately. It appears to us that the different results of ε' / ε in NDR and HV schemes can be regarded as the range of theoretical uncertainties.
