Main results

Our basic result is the following.

Fix a standard Young tableau T of shape [formula], let N(n;T) be the number of tableaux of n cells that contain T as a subtableau, and let tn be the number of all tableaux of n cells. Then we have

[formula]

where fλ is the number of all tableaux of shape λ. In other words, the probability that a large tableau contains T is equal to the number of tableaux whose shape is that of T, divided by k!.

We now state two corollaries of this theorem, after which we will discuss several applications. Two excellent references regarding the general theory of tableaux are [\cite=fu] and [\cite=kn].

Let C be a collection of Young tableaux, none of which is a subtableau of any other in the collection, and let N(n;C) be the number of Young tableaux of n cells which have a subtableau in C. The probability that a randomly chosen tableau of n cells has a subtableau in C is then N(n;C) / tn, where tn is the number of tableaux of n cells (equivalently, the number of involutions of n letters). We have

[formula]

where λ(T) is the shape of tableau T and |T| is the number of cells in T.

Thus we can speak of "the probability that a Young tableau has a subtableau appearing in C," without reference to the size, n, of the tableau. This phrase will mean the limit in ([\ref=eq:prdef]).

The next corollary is the special case of Corollary [\ref=cor:first] in which the distinguished list C of tableaux is defined by a list of allowable shapes.

Let L be a list of Ferrers diagrams with no shape a subshape of another in the list, and let N(n;L) be the number of Young tableaux of n cells which have a subtableau with shape in L. The probability that a tableau of n cells has such a subtableau is then N(n;L) / tn, and we have

[formula]

From these results, we will deduce a number of interesting consequences:

Let C be the list of all tableaux of k cells such that the letter k lives in the (i,j) position, for some fixed (i,j). Then [formula] is the probability that a Young tableau has the entry k in its (i,j) position. We will find a rather explicit formula (see subsection [\ref=subsec:onecell] below) for this probability. This formula was previously found by Regev [\cite=re].

Let C be the list of all tableaux of k cells in which a certain fixed collection of cells contain prescribed entries. Then [formula] is the probability that a Young tableau has the prescribed entries in the prescribed cells. We will find a rather explicit formula for this probability (see subsection [\ref=subsec:several] below). In the case where the fixed collection of cells consists of just two cells, this formula was also previously found by Regev [\cite=re], who also found this two-cell probability with a variety of measures on the space of tableaux. Our result, while it applies to arbitrary collections of prescribed cells, holds only in the uniform measure on tableaux.

Let L be the list of all partitions of the integer k whose parts are ≤  2, in Corollary [\ref=cor:second]. Then [formula] is the probability that a Young tableau has its smallest k letters in just two columns, and we'll find an explicit formula for it (see subsection [\ref=subsec:twocols] below).

Finally, in section [\ref=sec:cell12], we will find the probability that the (1,2) entry of a tableau of n cells is k, in the form of an exact formula that is valid for every n,k. The asymptotic form of this result will illustrate the rate of approach to the limit in the more general theorems already cited above.

We thank the anonymous referee who noted that our proof of Corollaries [\ref=cor:first] and [\ref=cor:second] actually proved them in the form shown here, which is more general than our original statement.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th:basic]

The set of letters [formula] is denoted

[formula]

depends only on the order of the first k letters in the involution φ, and does not depend on their preimages or on the disposition of the remaining n - k letters.

To see this, note that when a letter > k is inserted into some stage of the RS algorithm it cannot disturb the position of any letter ≤  k. [formula]

Fix a tableau T, of k cells. How many involutions of n letters correspond to a tableau that contains T as a subtableau? To answer this, let Z(k) denote the set of all permutations of k letters which correspond, under the RS correspondence, to an ordered pair of tableaux (T,T') for some tableau T'. Then an involution of n letters will correspond to a tableau that contains T iff the set of letters [formula] in its value sequence appear in one of the arrangements in Z(k).

Thus if σ is some permutation of k letters, and Fn(σ) denotes the number of involutions of n letters which contain σ as a subsequence, then exactly

[formula]

involutions of n letters correspond to tableaux which contain T as a subtableau, so the probability that a random n-tableau contains T is

[formula]

where tn is the number of n-involutions. What can be said about the summand Fn(σ) / tn? It is the probability that a random involution of

[formula]

contains the letters [formula] in some particular order, the question would have been trivial: the required probability would be exactly 1 / k!, no matter what the "particular order" was.

We claim that for involutions the answer is essentially the same, up to a term that is o(1) as n  →    ∞  .

Let σ be a fixed permutation of k letters. The probability that a random involution of n letters contains σ as a subsequence is 1 / k! + o(1), for n  →    ∞  .

We will prove this lemma in the next section as a corollary of a more general theorem about the quasirandomness of families of permutations.

However, for the moment let us imagine that we have proved the Lemma, and we will now finish the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:basic]. By ([\ref=eq:prob1]) and the Lemma, the probability that a tableau of n letters contains a given subtableau T of k letters is

[formula]

Since Z(k) is the number of all permutations of k letters corresponding to ordered pairs of the form (T,T') for some T', well-known RS theory gives that this is simply the number of tableaux T' whose shape is that of T, i.e. fλ(T). Thus the probability that a tableau of n letters contains a fixed T of k letters as a subtableau is

[formula]

and the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:basic] is complete. [formula]

Corollary [\ref=cor:first] follows from the theorem by summing over the tableaux in the list C, since two tableaux cannot be subtableaux of the same larger tableaux unless one is a subtableau of the other. Corollary [\ref=cor:second] follows from Corollary [\ref=cor:first] since, if C is the list of all of the tableaux whose shapes are in L,

[formula]

Involutions are typical

In this section we will prove a proposition that implies Lemma [\ref=lem:typ] above.

Let P be a collection of permutations such that [formula] is non-empty for infinitely many values of n, where Sn is the set of all permutations of

[formula]

, let h(n,τ) be the number of elements of Pn that have τ as a subsequence. If [formula], the probability that a random element of Pn has τ as a subsequence is p̃(n,τ)  =  h(n,τ) / |Pn|.

Inspired by the terminology of Chung and Graham [\cite=cgw], we say that P is quasirandom if, for each k  ≥  1,

[formula]

where the limit is restricted to those n for which Pn is nonempty and the maximum is over all sequences τ of k distinct elements of

[formula]

, and let S be the set of all permutations of I. Also let fn be the average number of fixed points of elements of Pn.

The set Pn can be expressed as a disjoint union

[formula]

where [formula], and

[formula]

The basic idea of the proof is that A(I) is small compared to Pn and the size of B(τ) is independent of τ.

We begin by showing that A(I) is small. Since Pn is closed under conjugation, all elements of

[formula]

Applications

In this section we will apply Theorem [\ref=th:basic] to the examples that were listed above in section [\ref=sec:result].

Occupancy of a cell in a tableau

For fixed positive integers (i,j) and k, what is the probability that a Young tableau has its (i,j) entry equal to k?

The list C here consists of all tableaux of k cells whose (i,j) entry is k. The required probability is, by Corollary [\ref=cor:first],

[formula]

where the latter sum extends over all partitions λ of the integer k whose Ferrers diagram has the cell (i,j) as a corner position, and λ - (i,j) is the Ferrers diagram of λ after removing the corner (i,j).

In particular cases one can make this quite explicit. Short computations with the hook formula now reveal, for instance, the following.

The probability that the (1,2) entry of a Young tableau is k is (k - 1) / k!, for [formula].

The probability that the (1,3) entry of a Young tableau is k is

[formula]

and the probability that the (2,2) entry is k + 1 is exactly the same! These cases were previously derived by Regev [\cite=re], and the fact that the (1,3) and the (2,2) answers are so related is explained there in a more combinatorial way.

We show below a short table of the limiting probability ([\ref=eq:oneentry]) that the (i,j) entry of a Young tableau is equal to k.

[formula]

Professor Okounkov has kindly communicated to us (p.c.) another, independent proof of the result ([\ref=eq:oneentry]).

Occupancies of several cells in a tableau

Suppose we're given a finite collection of cells [formula] and a collection of entries [formula]. Let K =  max iki. In Corollary [\ref=cor:first] let the list C consist of all tableaux of K cells that have the given entries in the given cells. Then the probability that a Young tableau has all of the entries

[formula]

is

[formula]

where the sum extends over all tableaux of K cells that have the given set of entries in the given set of cells.

We show below a short table of the joint distribution of cells (1,2) and (1,3). That is, the entry in row r and column s below is the limiting probability ([\ref=eq:setofcells]) that a Young tableau T will have T(1,2) = r and T(1,3) = s.

[formula]

An interesting special case

When the distinguished list C of k-tableaux consists of all tableaux that have a certain specified list L of shapes, or partitions of the integer k, we can use Corollary [\ref=cor:second]. It tells us that the probability that in a Young tableau, the subtableau formed by the letters [formula] has one of the shapes in a given list L of shapes is

[formula]

This will be recognized as a partial sum of the "Parseval identity"

[formula]

that holds in the symmetric group Sk. In fact Corollary [\ref=cor:second] shows that the quantity (fλ)2 / k! is the probability that in a large tableau T the letters [formula] will be arranged in the shape λ, and from this interpetation, ([\ref=eq:prsvl]) is obvious.

An example of this type, i.e., where membership in the distinguished list C depends only on the shape of the tableau, is the following: what is the probability that in a large Young tableau the letters [formula] are contained in a subtableau of at most two columns?

From Corollary [\ref=cor:second] and the hook formula it is a brief exercise to verify that this probability is

[formula]

An exact solution for the cell (1,2)

One of the consequences of our main theorem is, as we saw in item [\ref=itm:first] of subsection [\ref=subsec:onecell] above, the fact that the probability that the entry in the (1,2) position of a tableau is equal to k is (k - 1) / k!. It is instructive to work out this case also independently of our main theorem because it happens that an exact solution can be found for each n, instead of only a solution for the limiting probability. This will shed some light on the rate of convergence to the limit (see ([\ref=eq:secondterm]) below).

Let f(n,k) be the number of standard Young tableaux T of n cells (and more than one column) for which T1,2 = k. That is, f(n,k) is the number of standard tableaux with the letter k occuring in the first row and second column. If we look at the first few values of n we see the values of f(n,k)}nk = 1 that are shown below.

[formula]

Based on the Robinson-Schensted correspondence, we will find an exact formula (see ([\ref=eq:fform]) below) for these numbers.

For 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1, let F(n,k) denote the set of involutions of

[formula]

Proof.  Since the RS-correspondence is a bijection between all involutions and all pairs of standard tableaux (P,P), it suffices to show that under the RS-correspondence, an element ω∈F(n,k - 1) is sent to a pair (T,T) where the first k - 1 entries in the first column of T are [formula] and k∈T1,2. This follows from the definition of column insertion. That is, a letter [formula] is bumped out of the first column only if a letter j, where [formula], is column inserted after [formula]. If [formula] is any of the letters [formula], there is no letter j where [formula] inserted after [formula] and thus these letters all remain in the first column. On the other hand, since k is inserted before k - 1, it must be bumped to the second column and takes position T1,2. [formula]

Let G(n,k) be the number of involutions of

[formula]

Proof.  The set of all involutions containing the subsequence [formula] can be divided into the subset where k + 1 occurs before k and the subset where k + 1 occurs after k. By definition, this is to say that G(n,k) = |F(n,k)| + G(n,k + 1), which, after summation on k, establishes the result. [formula]

Now we can find an explicit formula for f(n,k) in terms of the number of certain involutions.

Let f(n,k) denote the number of standard tableaux on n letters with the entry k occuring in the (1,2) position. We then have the exact formula

[formula]

Proof.  Suppose G(n,k) is, as in Lemma [\ref=lem:rcrr], the number of involutions of
