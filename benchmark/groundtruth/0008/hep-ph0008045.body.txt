EXCITED HEAVY BARYON MASSES FROM THE 1 / Nc EXPANSION OF HQET

Introduction

Experimentally, a lot of data for orbitally excited heavy baryons have been accumulating [\cite=1]. The following charmed baryon states have been found, Λc(2593)+ with [formula] which is denoted as [formula], Λc(2625)+ with I(JP) = 0(?) denoted as [formula], where ? is [formula] from the quark model, and its strange analogues [formula].

Theoretical understanding of these baryons is necessary. The heavy quark effective theory (HQET) [\cite=3] provides a systematic way to investigate hadrons containing a single heavy quark. To obtain detailed prediction, however, some non-perturbative QCD methods have to be used, such as lattice simulation, 1 / Nc expansion [\cite=4] [\cite=5], chiral Lagrangian and QCD sum rules. In this talk we report the application of the 1 / Nc expansion method [\cite=6] [\cite=7].

Let us first make a brief review of the HQET [\cite=3]. It is an effective field theory of QCD for heavy hadrons. In the limit mQ  /  ΛQCD  →    ∞  , the heavy quark spin-flavor symmetry (HQS) is explicit. The 4-velocity v of the heavy quark becomes a good quantum number. Because mQ is unusable, it can be removed by redefining the heavy quark field:

[formula]

The effective Lagrangian is then

[formula]

The hadron mass is expanded as

[formula]

in the effective theory, that is

[formula]

Second, let us come to the 1 / Nc expansion [\cite=4]. This is a non-perturbative method of QCD. The idea is to extract out the non-perturbative information of SU(Nc) gauge theory by taking Nc  →    ∞  . The Nc counting rules are given as follows. The interaction vertex is [formula]; the quark propagator keeps unchanged; and the gluon propagator is represented by double lines, one for quarks and the other for anti-quarks.

For the mesons, the non-perturbative properties can be observed from the analysis of the planar diagrams. The large Nc limit is quite successful. Because the meson decay amplitude [formula], mesons and glue states are free and stable. This agrees qualitatively with color confinement. Another example is the explanation of the Zweig's rule.

For the baryons, the diagrammatic method does not work. The Hartree approximation can be adopted. The observation is that in the Nc  →    ∞   limit, interaction between any pair of quarks is negligible (~  1 / Nc); the total potential on an individual quark, which is ~  1, is a sum of many small terms, therefore it can be regarded as the background potential or a c-number potential. For ground state baryons, the many-body wave function is written as

[formula]

where φ(x,t) is one-body state. Interesting results for large Nc baryons can be obtained. The baryon-(anti-)baryon interaction is order Nc. And the baryon-meson interaction is order 1. However, the Hartree potential is not known, in which the two-body, three-body, and many-body interactions are the same important. One conjecture is that baryons are solitons of the mesonic theory, skyremions [\cite=8]!

Something more can be said about the large Nc baryons [\cite=5]. For the ground state baryons, there is a contracted SU(2Nf) light quark spin-flavor symmetry (LQS) in the large Nc limit. This was first obtained from the chiral perturbation theory of baryon-pion interactions in deriving the consistent conditions for the coupling constants in the large Nc limit. It can be also understood in the Hartree picture. This makes a 1 / Nc expansion based on the spin-flavor structure practically possible for the baryons. Many quantitative predictions and further extensions of the above result have been made [\cite=9]. In fact, this expansion is another scheme of the 1 / Nc expansion. This can be simply seen from considering the masses of the non-strange baryons,

[formula]

where the first line is the ordinary 1 / Nc expansion, and the second one the expansion based on the spin-flavor structure. Of course, in the Nc  →    ∞   limit, MH  =  Λ̄H = NcΛQCD = NcΛ̃QCD = mproton which is not so useful.

Excited Heavy Baryons in the 1 / Nc Expansion

For the charmed baryons like [formula], [formula], [formula], we analyze their masses Λ̄H in the 1 / Nc expansion. The classification of them is according to the angular momentum J, the isospin I and the total angular momentum of the light degrees of freedom Jl which becomes a good quantum number due to HQS. In this case, the excited hadron spectrum shows the degeneracy of pair of states which are related to each other by HQS. Constituently there are two ways for the L = 1 excitation. One is that the heavy quark is excited; the other is that one light quark is excited. Correspondingly under the LQS, the Nc - 1 light quarks are in the symmetric and mixed representation, respectively.

Symmetric Representation

In the symmetric representation, the picture for the light quarks is essentially the same as that of the ground state heavy baryons. The spin-flavor decomposition rule is I = Sl for the non-strange baryons, where Sl is the total spin of the light quark system. Note that the light quark system as a whole has L = 1 orbital angular momentum. All possible states of excited heavy baryons are listed in Table [\ref=tab:sym].

In the Hartree-Fock picture of the baryons, the Nc counting rules require us to include many-body interactions in the analysis. However, a large part of these interactions are spin-flavor irrelevant. Namely this part contributes in the order NcΛQCD universally to all the baryons with different spin-flavor structure in Table [\ref=tab:sym]. The mass splittings among the baryons can be obtained. For the purely light quark contribution to Λ̄H, the 1 / Nc analysis goes the same as that to the ground state heavy baryons. There is LQS at the leading order of the 1 / Nc expansion. The mass splitting due to the violation of LQS started from Sl2 / Nc. However, different from the ground state baryons, formally the orbital angular momentum of the heavy quark has more dominant contribution to Λ̄H than O(1 / Nc). This is because of the orbital-light-quark-spin interactions. After summing up all the relevant many-body interactions, this order O(1) contribution is [formula], where f is a general function which can be Taylor expanded. The mass Λ̄H can be written simply as

[formula]

where coefficients i  ~  ΛQCD (i = 0,1). There should be also a term proportional to L2 in the above equation, which gives constant contribution to Λ̄0H for a given light quark representation, and therefore has been absorbed into the leading term. The term [formula] can be rewritten as Jl2  -  Sl2 with [formula] being defined as [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

where coefficients ci  ~  ΛQCD.

Mixed Representation

In the mixed representation, all states are listed in Table [\ref=tab:mx]. Again, Λ̄H' is trivially NcΛQCD at the leading order of the 1 / Nc expansion. The spin-flavor dependence, however is more complicated. For the spectrum of excited light baryons, see ref. [\cite=9].

The many-body Hamiltonians related to the spin-flavor structure which involve orbital angular momentum L give O(1) contribution. We use the following operators which were used in [\cite=9] to analyze Λ̄H,

[formula]

The first one HLS is one-body Hamiltonian, while the others are two-body Hamiltonians. Gia are the generators of the spin-flavor symmetry group SU(4), given by

[formula]

with σi and τa being the spin and isospin matrices, respectively. Such structure gives coherent addition over Nc - 2 core quarks. The first Gia in HT acts on the excited quark, the other Gia's on the Nc - 2 unexcited light quarks, namely the core quarks. In our case, all the operators must be understood as the ones acting on the light degrees of freedom. Note that the higher order many-body Hamiltonian which contains more factor of Gia can be reduced to those given in Eq.([\ref=9]).

The contributions to the baryon masses due to these Hamiltonians are obtained by calculating the baryonic matrix elements. The matrix elements of these operators between the states of light quarks which specify the states of excited heavy baryons are given as follows,

[formula]

where Ic is the isospin of the core quarks. In real world (Nc = 3), there is only one quark in the core so Ic always equals [formula]. With these matrix elements, we can express the excited heavy baryon mass up to the zeroth order of 1 / Nc:

[formula]

where cLS, cT, and i's are the coefficients ~  ΛQCD.

Mixing

It is necessary to consider the mixing between the baryons with light quarks in the spin-flavor symmetric and mixed representations. When they have same good quantum numbers of (J, I, Jl), there is no physical way to distinguish them. This consideration will give the physical spectrum. Because of the light quark spin-flavor symmetry at the leading order of 1 / Nc expansion, the baryons with same (J, I, Jl) quantum numbers but in different representations do not mix. (Sl is a good quantum number in Nc  →    ∞  .) [\cite=2]. The mixing occurs at the sub-leading order. The classification of baryons by the spin-flavor symmetry is therefore physical at the leading order. For the physical spectrum, the mixing results in a deviation from Λ̄0H. By denoting the mixing mass as [formula] which is of O(1), the mass matrix for the baryons with same (J,I,Jl) is written as

[formula]

The mass difference Λ̄0H  -  Λ̄0H' is O(1). Taking   <  Λ̄0H'  -  Λ̄0H for illustration, the physical masses are corrected to be

[formula]

The 1 / Nc expansion of [formula] is parameterized as

[formula]

where 0 is universal due to LQS. To the order of O(1), the spectrum is,

[formula]

where k is an O(1) constant which is what remains after the Λ̄0H' and Λ̄0H cancellation. Note that the masses of the states [formula] and [formula] are not affected by the mixing, because there are no physical states with the same good quantum numbers in the mixed representation. From the above spectrum, we see that c1 > 0. The states [formula] is always the highest states. They are heavier than the other states at least by 4c1 through requiring the states [formula] to be the lowest. If [formula], the requirement implies

[formula]

In this case, the spectrum pattern is

[formula]

On the other hand, if [formula], the requirement is

[formula]

which gives the spectrum

[formula]

The experimentally found baryons [formula] and [formula] correspond to the [formula] states. More data are needed to fix the unknown parameters ci's, [formula]'s, k and cLS. In the near future, experiments will check the above predicted spectrum. Hopefully one of the above mass patterns will be picked out. It will be a check for the validity of our method, if the parameters are in the reasonable range (ΛQCD) and meanwhile satisfy the relations given above.

Summary

In summary, we have reported the 1 / Nc expansion method in studying the spectra of the L = 1 orbitally excited heavy baryons within the framework of HQET. The analysis is very simple for the baryons with light quarks being in the spin-flavor symmetric representation, compared to that for the heavy baryons with light quarks in the mixed representation. The simplicity is an unique feature. It can be seen from the point that the light quark system is in the ground state and it is the heavy quark that is orbitally excited. However the mixing effect due to the baryon states in the mixed representation corrects the spectrum pattern in the sub-leading order of 1 / Nc expansion. The effect is important to get the realistic spectra at this order. The general pattern of the baryon spectrum has been given, which will be verified by the experiments in the near future. The 1 / mQ and SU(3) corrections have been considered in ref. [\cite=6]. Certain mass relations for the baryons Λ( * )c1, Σ( * )c1, Ξ(')( * )c1, and Ω( * )c1 have been derived. The same analysis can be applied to the bottom baryons.
