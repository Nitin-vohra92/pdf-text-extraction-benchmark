ON THE PHASE OF THE OFF-SHELL SCATTERING AMPLITUDES

Division of Theoretical Physics, IHEP, Protvino, Russia

Let Tl(s) is the partial wave amplitude for elastic scattering with angular momentum l and c.m.s. energy [formula]. Assuming that there is no unphysical thresholds we consider "elastic region" in s, where unitarity takes a simple form

[formula]

Let now one of the four interacting particles is off-shell, and denote the corresponding amplitude by [formula]. If two particles (one final and one initial) are off mass-shell then Tl *  * is the corresponding amplitude. For simplicity we take all off-shell momenta below the mass-shell.

In this case for the same "elastic region" one can get from unitarity that

[formula]

[formula]

In terms of the following parametrisation

[formula]

we have from Eqs.(1), (2) and (3)

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

whereof we came to the equality:

[formula]

That is the main result of this note:

onefold off-shell extension of the partial wave scattering amplitude in the "elastic region" in the c.m.s. energy does not change the phase. In particular

[formula]

where rl(s,q2) is a real-analytic function in s and has no elastic threshold singularity.

We also have to stress that for the "full" amplitude,

[formula]

its phase generally depends on q2-value.

It is a pleasure to thank A.Martin and T.T.Wu for useful discussions.
