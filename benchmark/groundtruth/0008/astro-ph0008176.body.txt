RXTE observations of XTE J2012+381 during its 1998 outburst.

Introduction

The XTE J2012+381 was discovered as a new transient source on May 27, 1998 by All Sky Monitor (ASM) aboard the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, RXTE (Bradt, Swank & Rothschild 1993) observatory (Remillard et al. 1998). The X-ray source was localized with an accuracy of 1 arcmin in multiple scans of the region by PCA/ RXTE experiment (Marshall & Strohmayer 1998): [formula] (equinox 2000.0). Observations in the optical band by 1.0-m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope showed the presence of possible optical counterpart USNO 1275.13846761 : [formula] (equinox 2000.0)(Hynes & Roche 1998). Observations in the radio band by VLA revealed the presence of the likely counterpart of XTE J2012+381: [formula] (equinox 2000.0, uncertainty 0.5 arcsec ) as well. Significant variability of the new radio source supports its association with X-ray transient (Hjellming et al. 1998).

Pointed instruments of RXTE - PCA and HEXTE observed the source quasi evenly from May to July 1998, providing a good coverage of the whole outburst. The flux from the source was above ASM/ RXTE detection limit until December 2, 1998. In this Letter we present the results of a spectral and timing analysis of RXTE pointed observations.

Observations and data analysis

In our analysis we used all the publicly available data obtained from RXTE archive including 24 pointed observations. The 24 observations quasi evenly cover the 1998 outburst of the source with a total exposure of ~  46 ks. The list of observations is presented in Table [\ref=obslog].

For data reduction we used the standard FTOOLS package version 5.0 For the spectral analysis we used PCA data collected in the 3-20 keV energy range. The response matrix was constructed for every observation using pcarmf v3.5. For the PCA background subtraction we applied a Very Large Events (VLE)-based model. The standard dead time correction procedure was applied to the PCA data. In order to account for the uncertainties of the response matrix, a 1% systematic error was added to the statistical error for each PCA energy channel.

HEXTE data reduction was done with FTOOLS 5.0 standard tasks and according to RXTE GOF recommendations.

We generated the energy spectra of XTE J2012+381 averaging the data over the whole single observations. The spectral data were approximated with the simplest two-component model: the sum of the XSPEC "multicolor disk black body" (Mitsuda et al. 1984) and a simple power law model with inclusion of a broad gaussian emission line at 6.4 keV. The results of the spectral approximation of the PCA data with analytical models described above are presented in Table [\ref=spec_pars].

For the timing analysis of XTE J2012+381 the PCA Generic Event timing mode data were used. We generated power density spectra (PDS) in the 0.001  -  4096 Hz frequency range using combined data of several consequitive observations in order to improve statistical significance of the results. The resulting spectra were logarithmically rebinned to reduce scatter at high frequencies and normalized to square root of fractional variability rms. The white noise due to the Poissonian statistics corrected for the dead-time effects, was subtracted ([\cite=vihl94]; [\cite=zhang95]; [\cite=mikej00]).

Results

The X-ray flux history of the XTE J2012+381 outburst based on RXTE/PCA and ASM data in 1.3-12 keV energy range is shown in Fig.[\ref=lcurve]. The evolution of the source flux in the soft X-ray band (1.3  -  12 keV as well as in 3  -  20 keV energy band) was characterized by the fast initial rise to a level of ~  220 mCrab on a time scale of ~   a week followed by a ~  3 day long maximum and relatively slow decay, interrupted by secondary maximum ~  30 days after the beginning of the outburst. The subsequent outburst evolution was unusual because of long and powerful tertiary peak (close to 150 days from the beginning of the outburst).

The energy spectra of the X-ray transient were quite typical - a dominant soft thermal component with a rather weak power law tail. Unfortunately, the transient was not bright enough for high energy instrument aboard RXTE (HEXTE), so we could not trace the energy spectrum of XTE J2012+381 to energies higher than ~  80 keV.

XTE J2012+381 one more time demonstrated that the soft spectral component in the spectra of X-ray Novae rise not instantly, but slightly after the power law component. The similar behavior was observed in Nova Muscae 1991 ([\cite=muscae]), KS 1730-312 ([\cite=ks1730]), GRS 1739-278 ([\cite=1739]) and XTE J1748-288 ([\cite=1748]). The sequence of typical spectra is presented in Fig. [\ref=3spectra]. One can see that during the first observation the soft component is not very strong (May 27, 1998), the second spectrum already has much more dominant soft component (June 1, 1998) and the third spectrum shows the weakening of the power law component (July 7, 1998). Broad band spectrum, averaged over observations #  2  -    #  17 is presented in Fig. [\ref=broad].

As it is clearly seen from Fig. [\ref=power], the average power density spectrum of the source is dominated by Very Low Frequency noise (VLFN) component, reasonably approximated by a simple power law model ([formula]) with a slope [formula] (0.001  -  0.5 Hz frequency range). We have not detected any statistically significant source flux variability at the frequencies higher than ~   1 Hz. The 2 Ïƒ upper limit on the possible Lorentzian component at f  ~  500  -  1000 Hz is approximately 2% for Q  =  10 and 1% for Q  =  1. In Fig. [\ref=rms] the fractional rms amplitude of variability is shown as a function of the photon energy. In spite of a poor statistics (very low amplitude of X-ray variability), one can see that there is an indication on the rise of the rms with energy. Such dependence is quite typical for the emission of black hole candidates in the Very High State (VHS)(see discussion of such behavior in [\cite=chur00]).

Discussion

The the properties of the outburst of XTE J2012+381 are very similar to what of the X-ray Novae. It has a FRED (fast-rise-exponential-decay) light curve, with secondary maxima, as typical for X-ray transients ([\cite=chen97]).

The spectrum of the source can be well described by standard two-component model which is typical for black hole candidate X-ray binaries ([\cite=tl95]). The evolution of the energy spectrum of XTE J2012+381 can be characterized as a gradual increase of the contribution of the soft thermal component as the overall X-ray flux decreases.

Our calculations show that the value of model parameter Rin cos i, inferred from the soft spectral component approximation is nearly constant during the decay phase of the outburst (Table [\ref=spec_pars]) in general agreement with earlier results of [\cite=Zh98]. However we believe that it is premature to assume a constant radius of inner accretion disk during the outburst.

The PDS of XTE J2012+381 is also very typical for the VHS of black hole candidates with dominant soft spectral component. The energy dependence of the fractional rms provided another hint at the universal correlation between the amplitude of the variability and relative strength of the hard spectral component.
