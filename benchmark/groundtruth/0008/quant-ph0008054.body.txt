Abstract: We recover the rays in the tensor product of Hilbert spaces within a larger class of so called 'states of compoundness', structured as a complete lattice with the 'state of separation' as its top element. At the base of the construction lies the assumption that the cause of actuality of a property of one of the (as individual considered) entities in the compound system can be actuality of a property of the other one.

1. INTRODUCTION

Most approaches towards a realistic description of compound --quantum-- systems are based on the recognition of subsystems, imposing some mathematical universal property as a structural criterion (Hellwig and Krauser, 1977; Zecca, 1977; Aerts and Daubechies, 1978; Aerts, 1982; Pulmannová, 1984; Ischi, 1999; Valckenborgh, 2000). In this paper we take a different point of view, essentially focusing on a structural characterization of the interaction between the individual entities, rather than on the compound system as a whole. More precisely, we structurize the concept of 'mutual induction of actuality' for the 'individual entities' in a compound system, inspired by the existence of an --essentially unique-- representation for compound quantum systems when postulating that a state transition of one individual entity induces a state transition of the others --see Coecke (1998a). In particular will we consider 'separation' as one particular state of compoundness, and not as a type of 'entity' as in Aerts (1982) and Ischi (1999), as such avoiding some axiomatic drawbacks that emerge when taking the latter perspective. Formally, an essential ingredient of the reasoning can be borrowed from Faure et al. (1995) where propagation of states and properties in maximal deterministic evolutions is studied. As an application of our way of looking at compoundness we mention a representation for spin systems (Coecke 1995, 1998b). The mathematical preliminaries to this paper are basic notions on linear operators for which we refer to Weidmann (1981) and that of a Galois dual pair, i.e., a couple of isotone maps f:M  →  N and f*:N  →  M satisfying [formula], where f preserves existing joins, f* preserves existing meets, and we have existence and uniqueness of it for a meet (resp. join) preserving map between complete lattices (Birkhoff, 1940; Johnstone, 1982). 2. COMPOUNDNESS AND ASSIGNMENT OF CAUSES

Let us first recall the general concept of an entity, along the lines of Jauch and Piron (1969), Piron (1976) and Aerts (1982) --we will not go into the details on this and refer for the most recent overview to Moore (1999). We consider an entity to be a physical system described by a collection of either potential or actual properties L, partially ordered by an --operationally motivatable-- implication relation '≤  ', and which proves to be a complete lattice (Piron, 1976). As is discussed in Piron (1977) and Moore (1999), the meet '[formula]' can be treated as a classical conjunction. A property is said to be 'actual' if we get true with certainty when it would be verified in any possible way; a∈L is stronger (resp. weaker) than b∈L iff a  ≤  b (resp. b  ≤  a); the top element 1 of the complete lattice can be seen as expressing 'existence' of the entity and the bottom element 0 expresses the 'absurd', i.e., what can never be true. As an example, the property lattice LH of a quantum entity described in a Hilbert space H is the set of closed subspaces ordered by inclusion with intersection as meet and closed linear span as join. We will also systematically use the term 'individual entity' when considering identifiable 'parts' in a larger system --as such to be seen as a compound system-- since in general, these individual entities do not satisfy the general conception of what an entity is in the references mentioned above --for a discussion on this aspect see Coecke (1998a). In the presence of interaction between individual entities, actuality of a property a2∈L2 of individual entity S2 might be due to the actuality of a property a1∈L1 of individual entity S1. In particular, we will show that all interaction involved in quantum entanglement can be expressed in this way, and therefore we define a map:

[formula]

This cause of actuality of a2 is the weakest a1∈L1 that assures actuality of a2: indeed, any b1∈L1 with b1  ≤  a1 then automatically causes actuality of a2 since it implies a1. Note that existence of such a weakest a1∈L1 follows from the fact that 'assuring actuality of a2' precisely defines it as a property for S1. As an example, when considering two separated individual entities it is the bottom element 01∈L1 that assures actuality of any [formula], explicitly expressing that no state of L1 assures anything about L2. On the contrary, the property 11 assures actuality of 12 since we a priori assume the existence of both individual entities. When considering meets [formula] in L2, due to their significance as a classical conjunction, i.e. they can be read as 'and', [formula] assures actuality of [formula], as such assuring f* to preserve non-empty meets. Since [formula] and f*(12) = 11 by assumption of the existence of both individual entities, it also preserves the empty meet. Thus, there exists a unique join-preserving Galois dual for f*, namely:

[formula]

From eq.([\ref=Galois]) it follows that f assigns to a property a1∈L1 the strongest property a2∈L2 of which it assures actuality --the minimum of all a2∈L2 such that a1  ≤  f*(a2)-- implicitly implying actuality of all b2  ≥  a2. Thus, f expresses exactly induction of actuality of L1 on L2.

i) STRUCTURING STATES OF COMPOUNDNESS:

Denote by Q(L1,L2) the join preserving maps from L1 to L2 and set for all {fi}i  ⊆  Q(L1,L2):

[formula]

Eq([\ref=bigvee]) defines a complete internal operation on Q(L1,L2) since for {fi}i  ⊆  Q(L1,L2): [formula], and one easily verifies that [formula] is the least upper bound of {fi}i in Q(L1,L2). Analogously, the collection of meet preserving maps f*:L2  →  L1 denoted by Q*(L1,L2) is a meet complete lattice with respect to pointwise meet, denoted as [formula]. Note here that the significance of the lattice meet as a classical conjunction is lifted by the pointwise computed meets to the level of assignment of temporal causes, as such giving to [formula] the significance of 'f* and g*'. Set L*(f,a2) = {a1∈L1|f(a1)  ≤  a2} and L(f*,a1) = {a2∈L2|a1  ≤  f*(a2)}. If [formula], then

[formula]

, L(g*,a1)  ⊆  L(f*,a1), [formula], and thus f  ≤  g. As such f  ≤  g iff g*  ≤  f*. It follows that [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic complete lattices --'( - )op' stands for reversal of partial order.

ii) SEPARATION AS THE TOP STATE OF COMPOUNDNESS:

Since we have [formula] in case of separation, the 'state of separation' for S1 on S2 is given by [formula] and this is exactly the top element 11,2 of Q(L1,L2) --note that 01  ↦  02 is required for any join preserving map, the bottom being the empty join. Remark that the bottom element 01,2 of Q(L1,L2) stands for the 'absurd state of compoundness'. Indeed, since f:L1  →  L2:a1  ↦  01 we have f*:L2  →  L1:a2  ↦  11, i.e., existence of S1 causes actuality of all properties of S2, and as such actuality of the absurd property [formula].

iii) QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT AS ATOMIC STATES OF COMPOUNDNESS:

We will now consider those f∈Q(LH1,LH2) that send atoms to atoms or 02 for LH1 and LH2 the lattices of closed subspaces of Hilbert spaces. The following result can be found in Faure et al. (1995) and is essentially based on Faure and Frölicher (1993, 1994) and Piron (1964, 1976): Any non-trivial  Proof: Let Kf and Kg be the respective kernels of the linear maps F,G:H1  →  H2 induced by f,g∈Q(LH1,LH2) with f < g, and thus, Kg  ⊂  Kf and [formula]. For [formula] and [formula] we have F(ψ  +  φ) = F(ψ) = G(ψ) whereas G(ψ  +  φ) = G(ψ) + G(φ), forcing G(ψ) = kG(φ) for k non-zero. However, then G(kψ  -  φ) = 0 although [formula], yielding contradiction except when [formula], i.e., = 01,2. [formula]

For the sake of transparency of the argument we will from now on only consider finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Let H'1 be the Hilbert space of continuous linear functionals on H1, connected to it by the correspondence H1  →  H'1:ψ  ↦  〈ψ| - 〉. Then the tensor product [formula] is isomorphic to the space of linear operators with indicated domain and codomain --denoted as B(H1,H2)-- by the isomorphism:

[formula]

with {ψi}i and {φi}i fixed orthonormal bases --note that [formula] for [formula] the Hilbert space metric and || - ||HS the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. Considering anti-linear maps [formula] --say B'(H1,H2)-- with a reasoning along the same lines, we obtain [formula]. As such, we recover the rays of the tensor product of Hilbert spaces [formula] as a special case of our more general class of atomic states of compoundness, besides the rays [formula]. Indeed, although [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic as Hilbert spaces, there rays represent different states of compoundness.

3. COMPOUNDNESS AS EVOLUTION -- AND VICE VERSA

Although we were able to use much material from Faure et al. (1995) --that deals with evolution of an entity-- we should note that an essential difference between the two formal developments is due to the fact that existence of the entity at a certain instance of time in general does not assure existence in the future when considering evolution. However, imposing a condition on the 'type' of evolution that we consider by 'requiring preservation' makes an illustrative comparison possible, and as such we will proceed. To fix ideas, identify L1 with the property lattice of a fixed entity at time t1 and L2 as its property lattice at time t2. We can again consider a map f*:L2  →  L1 that assigns to a property that is actual at time t2 the cause of its actuality at time t1, and the corresponding Galois dual f:L1  →  L2 that now expresses temporal propagation of properties, all of them again structured in Q(L1,L2).

Example 1: A 'maximal deterministic evolution' is defined as one where atoms propagate to atoms or 02 --the latter in order to express a domain for initial states-- mirroring atomic states of compoundness.

Example 2: We could define a 'maximal indeterministic --or minimal deterministic-- evolution' as one that strictly assures existence at time t2, yielding the mirror of the state of separation.

For a more elaborated formal discussion on the connection between compoundness and evolution we refer to Coecke and Stubbe (1999a) and Coecke and Moore (2000).

4. ON ASSIGNMENT OF PROPER STATES TO INDIVIDUALIZED ENTITIES

The discussion on evolution was not merely illustrative but constitutes an essential ingredient in this section, where we discuss state transitions of individual entities due to a state of compoundness: in Section 2 we characterized entanglement between individual entities in a compound system, but no consideration on a characterization of individual entities themselves has been made. Indeed, a description of a compound system consisting of two individual entities S1 and S2 requires a characterization of these individual entities themselves besides the states of compoundness f1,2 of S1 on S2 and f2,1 of S2 on S1. However, this proves to requires a more general concept of state than in Piron (1976), Aerts (1982) and Moore (1995), and a different name proper state has been introduced in Coecke (1998a) to stress this difference. Therefore consider for each individual entity an a priori set of proper states Σ and denote by C:P(Σ)  →  L the map that assigns to any T in P(Σ), the powerset of Σ, the strongest property in L that is implied by every p∈ T. As shown in Coecke and Stubbe (1999a, 1999b), C canonically induces a pre-order on Σ by p  ≤  Cq  ⇔  C({p})  ≤  C({q}). Moreover, the above discussed requirement that properties propagate with preservation of join (see also Pool, 1968) restricts the --not-necessarily deterministic-- state transitions to be described by a map in:

[formula]

that proves to be a quantale [formula] --i.e., a join-complete lattice equipped with an additional operation [formula] that distributes over arbitrary joins-- where [formula] is computed pointwise, and which is in epimorphic --quantale-- correspondence with the 'quantale' [formula] --see above-- by:

[formula]

Note that this quantale epimorphism indeed exactly expresses that with any state transition there corresponds a join preserving propagation of properties. We apply all this to the context of this paper:

For each individual entity S, let Ψ:L  →  Q#(Σ) be the map that assigns to any property a∈L the --not-necessarily deterministic-- state transition Ψ(a):P(Σ)  →  P(Σ) that S undergoes when actuality of property  a  is induced on it by interaction with another individual entity.

Clearly this implicitly determines the propagation of properties ΨL:L  →  Q(L,L) by [formula]. We will now discuss Ψ and ΨL for L orthomodular, and more specific, for the Hilbert space case.

i) ORDERING OF STATES VIA 'DESCENDING' INDUCTION OF ACTUAL PROPERTIES Proof: Following Piron (1976), p.69, Theorem 4.3, if properties described by an orthomodular property lattice change in such a way that a property a∈L becomes actual, and such that all properties compatible to a that where actual beforehand, are still actual afterwards, then the corresponding transition of properties is exactly described by the Sasaki projection [formula]. Thus, (ii) assures that ΨL(a) = φa. If p∈Ψ(a)({q}) for a  ≤  C({q}), then C({p})  ≤  C(Ψ(a)({q})) = φa(C({q})  ≤  a --the equality follows from eq.([\ref=qunatdual])-- we have C({p})  ≤  C({q}) and thus p  ≤  Cq. Note that (i) is equivalent to Ψ(a) being identical on all p∈Σ such that C({p})  ≤  a, and thus yields reflexivity since it forces the restriction of Ψ(a) to {T  ⊆  Σ|C(T)  ≤  a} --which is the only part of the domain involved in defining [formula]-- to be idempotent. We can't have [formula] and [formula] since any transition Ψ(a)({q}) = {p} requires again by (i) that [formula] where C({q})  ≤  a. Following Foulis (1960), the maps {φa|a∈L} are structured in a complete lattice isomorphic to L itself when ordered by φa'  ≤  φa  ⇔  φa'  =  φa'φa. Now consider a  ≥  a', then φa  ≥  φa'  =  φa'φa, i.e., φa'φa only depends on a' and not on a. Thus, (iii) yields transitivity since it forces Ψ(a')(Ψ(a)({q})) = Ψ(a')({q}), and this independent of a provided that a  ≥  a'. [formula]

Note that condition (ii) says that actual properties are only altered in a minimal way. Now consider --under the assumptions of the above proposition-- a chain [formula] in L1 of consecutive strongest actual properties of S1. By isotonicity of f1,2 we have [formula] and thus for {p2'}  =  Ψ(f1,2(a1'))({p2}) we have [formula] for p2 initial, yielding [formula]. As such, the relation [formula] expresses evolution of S2 due to mutual induction of actuality as a descending chain of proper states in Σ2, with descending strongest actual properties in L2.

ii) PROPER STATES FOR COMPOUND QUANTUM SYSTEMS

At this point it is required to propose a candidate for the sets of proper states Σ1 and Σ2 in the Hilbert space case that allows us to fully recover the description of compound quantum systems. Let Pai:Hi  →  Hi be the orthogonal projector corresponding to φai for i∈{1,2} with ai a closed subspace of Hi and set:

[formula]

One easily verifies that Ψi defines state transitions for (Σi,Ci) that fulfill Proposition [\ref=orderofstates] and that the one dimensional projectors are minimal in [formula]. Moreover, the restriction of Ψi(ai) to {T  ⊆  Σi|Ci(T)  ≤  ai} maps a singleton on a singleton or [formula] for all ai∈Li, i.e., the transitions due to induction of properties less than the strongest actual one are maximally deterministic. Now, given F∈B(H1,H2) representing f1,2 with [formula] as its adjoint, then:

[formula]

uniquely defines a quadruple (f1,2,ρ1,ρ2,f2,1) which exactly yields the quantum probability structure in the following way: (i) The transition probability for {ρi}  ↦  {ρi'}  =  Ψi(ai)({ρi}) with [formula] in a measurement that verifies the property ai is Tr(PaiρiPai); (ii) when this happens, say {ρ1}  ↦  {ρ1'}, this transition causes a1' = C1({ρ1'}) to become actual, and consequently, causes a2' = f1,2(a1') to become actual, having a transition {ρ2}  ↦  {ρ2'}  =  Ψ2(a2')({ρ2}) as a consequence; (iii) this reasoning can be proceeded inductively, and stops once we reach the minimal elements of [formula]. It can then be verified that the probability for the chains [formula] and [formula] to have a couple (C1(Pψ),C2(Pφ)) as respective outcome 'states' --which are indeed represented as atoms of the property lattice-- is given by :

[formula]

for [formula], and this is indeed the quantum transition probability in a measurement on a compound system described by [formula]. We end by stressing that due to the assignment in eq([\ref=FtoQuad]), the initial proper states of the compound quantum system are fully encoded in the states of compoundness, and thus encoded in [formula] via B'(H1,H2).

5. CONCLUSION

In this paper we proposed an alternative approach towards an understanding of the description of compound quantum systems, by essentially focusing on the interaction of the individual entities within the compound system. Obviously, a lot more investigation could be done on a more accurate characterization of quantum entanglement as a special case of the primal considerations made in this paper. Also an elaboration on the description of compound systems consisting of more than two entities would be worthwhile.
