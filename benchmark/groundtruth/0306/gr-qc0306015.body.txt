Post Newtonian Rigid Body

The idea of Newtonian rigid body has been used to treat the rotation of astronomical bodies up to now. For example, most Newtonian treatments of Earth's rotation are based on an accurate rigid body theory (such as SMART 97 [\cite=bret97] [\cite=bret98]) plus the perturbative argument from elasticity, the oceans, the atmosphere, the core and so on [\cite=deha99]. The idea of a rigid body in Newtonian theory is very powerful in introducing three principal axes of a body, the spin axis, rotation axis and figure axis without ambiguity. Then it makes the problem much simpler since there exists the key simple relation between the quadrupole moment and the moment of inertia tensor in a rigid body. But even in Newtonian theory the concept of a rigid body is only an ideal one, because there is no real rigid body in the physical world [\cite=gold80]. Owing to the modern high accuracy requirement, the Newtonian theory has to be replaced by Einstein's general relativity (at least its first post-Newtonian (PN) approximation). The problems of the post-Newtonian rigid body have been discussed for a long time since Born's kinematical rigidity (see Dixon's review [\cite=dixo79]). The kinematical rigidity is dependent on the internal velocity distribution within the body while not considering the stress and energy fluxes contribution on the energy-momentum tensor Tαβ. Dixon [\cite=dixo79], Thorne & Gürsel [\cite=thor83], Klioner [\cite=klio96] [\cite=klio97] [\cite=klio01] and Soffel [\cite=soff94] have done in a much better way, so-called dynamical rigidity way, in which Tαβ of the body and the gravitational field caused by the body satisfy some certain interdependency. The interdependency is not the same for different authors. However all of the different interdependencies make the PN spin Si proportional to the angular velocity Ωa and define a relativistic moment of inertia tensor. Certainly, the interdependency for the Newtonian rigid body just corresponds to the simple formula between mass density and current density (shown in Eq. ([\ref=3gt])). But none of them obtains the key simple relation between the PN quadrupole moment Mab and the PN moment of inertia tensor Iab like Newtonian one as shown in Eq. ([\ref=6gt]). Some scientists even assert that such a key relation is invalid in general relativity [\cite=thor83] [\cite=klio96]. Therefore the idea of PN rigidity almost has not been directly applied to practical problems up to now. We have a different opinion. We think because no one has discovered a suitable interdependency inside the energy-momentum tensor and the gravitational field before, then the key relation between PN Mab and PN Iab is not found. In this paper we present a suitable new interdependency to obtain the PN Iab and the key relation between PN Mab and PN Iab similar to Newtonian one. It is the first time to solve the rigid body problem on the post-Newtonian level. Recently we suggested another interdependency inside the energy-momentum tensor and gravitational field of the rigid body on PN level by means of a special gauge condition [\cite=tao03], but the special gauge condition is more or less speculative and difficult to be commonly accepted. In this paper we totally discard the special gauge condition, and present a general expression of the rigid spin with or without external field (free precession).

First let us recall the basic aspects of the Newtonian rigid body. We take Σ and Σa ( = ΣVa) as the mass density and the mass current density of a rigid body A respectively. Then the mass multipole moments ML and spin Sa of body A are defined as [formula] and [formula], where X̂L is an abbreviation of [formula], in which ij ([formula]) is a spatial index, the angular brackets mean "symmetrize and take the trace-free part" (STF). In Newtonian rigid body the rotational angular velocity Ω is independent of spatial coordinate, we have

[formula]

Insert Eq. ([\ref=3gt]) into the expression of spin, we have the linear relation between the spin and angular velocity Sa = IabΩb, where the moment of inertia tensor Iab is [formula].

The mass quadrupole moment and the moment of inertia tensor satisfy the key relation

[formula]

By means of the continuity equation ∂TΣ  +  ∂aΣa = 0, the time derivative of the moment of inertia tensor Iab is proportional to the angular velocity Ω

[formula]

[formula] satisfies a similar relation as ([\ref=9gt]). Therefore, Iab and Mab like constant tensors, will rigidly rotate in space with the angular velocity Ω.

When we discuss PN rigidity, we will use the symbols, notations and conventions following the 1PN theoretical framework presented by Damour, Soffel and Xu (cited below as the DSX scheme [\cite=damo91] [\cite=damo92] [\cite=damo93]) since the DSX scheme is not only rather simple and complete but also describes the 1PN definition of spin in a satisfactory manner. In the DSX scheme a complete 1PN general relativistic celestial mechanics for N arbitrarily composed and shaped, rotating deformable bodies is described. Here we will briefly summarize the notation and definition in the DSX scheme. In the post Newtonian expansion we will always abbreviate the order symbol O(c- n) simply as O(n). A spatial multi-index containing l indices is simply denoted by L (and K for k indices, etc), i.e. [formula]. A multisummation is always understood for repeated multi-indices [formula]. Given a spatial vector, ni, its lth tensorial power is denoted by [formula]. Also, [formula]. Besides angular brackets the symmetric and trace-free (STF) part of a spatial tensor will be denoted by a caret when no ambiguity arises: [formula]. The spatial indices, i,j = 1,2,3 are freely raised or lowered by means of the Cartesian metric δij  =  δij  =  diag( + 1, + 1, + 1) in Cartesian coordinates. The metric is presented by means of potential W and vector potential Wa (see Eq. (4.1) of Ref. [\cite=damo91]). W and Wa can be separated into self-part (with a "+") and external-part (with a bar), i.e. [formula] and [formula]. The self-part W+ and W+a will be solved by the gravitational mass density Σ and the mass current density Σa as: [formula], and [formula], through the 1PN Einstein field equation and the coordinate conditions (gauge conditions) (see Eq. (4.3) of Ref. [\cite=damo91]), where Tαβ is the energy-momentum tensor. W+ and W+a will be expanded by STF BD mass moments ML and STF spin moments SL (see Eq. (6.11) of Ref. [\cite=damo91]). The external part [formula] and [formula] can be expanded by gravito-electric tidal moments GL and gravito-magnetic tidal moments HL (see Eq. (4.15) of Ref. [\cite=damo92]). GL and HL are also STF spatial tensors dependent on time only. BD mass moments [\cite=blan89] are widely accepted as the best PN mass moments, which have the form

[formula]

The PN spin moment has been discussed for a long time [\cite=damo93] [\cite=damo91a]. In the DSX scheme, the expression of 1PN spin of body A is

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], dot means time derivative ∂T, N̂L and P̂L are defined as (see Eq. (2.10) of [\cite=damo93]) [formula] and [formula] respectively. Later we omit to indicate the body label, A, on all quantities. In Ref. [\cite=damo93], N̂L and P̂L are called "bad moments". In such a definition of 1PN spin vector, SPNa satisfies the rotational equation of motion (see Eq. (3.11) of Ref. [\cite=damo93]). We also have 1PN continuity equation for (Σ, ~ Σa) (see Eq. (5.6b) of Ref. [\cite=damo91])

[formula]

Those are the equations which are taken from the DSX scheme and will be used in the following discussion on the PN rigidity.

The definition of the 1PN rigid body has to agree with the Newtonian rigid body when 1 / c2 terms are neglected. In the 1PN rigid body the angular velocity should be independent of the local coordinate Xa of body A. In the DSX scheme we substitute Σ and Σc for the energy-momentum tensor Tαβ, therefore the interdependency inside the energy-momentum tensor and gravitational field in Ref. [\cite=thor83] [\cite=klio96] [\cite=klio97] might be replaced by inside Σ, ~ Σc and gravitational field. We expect that the interdependency will produce equations similar to ([\ref=6gt]) and ([\ref=9gt]) on the PN level. On the PN level it is sufficient to replace Tαβ by Σ, ~ Σc and their derivative [\cite=xu01]. Before a further discussion on the rigid body, the rigid BD moments and the rigid 1PN spin vector should be considered. In the rigid body, since P̂L and N̂L are PN terms we can substitute the Newtonian relations (Eq.([\ref=3gt]) and Newtonian continuity equation) for the definitions of N̂L and P̂L. It is easy to prove

[formula]

Lemma 1 The rigid BD mass moments of rigid body A (Eq. ([\ref=11gt])) can be simplified as

[formula]

Proof of Lemma 1. Starting from Eq. ([\ref=11gt]) (the definition of BD mass moment) and replacing the third term in the RHS of Eq. ([\ref=11gt]) by Eq. ([\ref=17gt]). The prove will be carried out directly. In fact only the relativistic quadrupole moment is interested in, because in the solar system all of the relativistic higher multipole moments are too small to be considered in any modern measurement in the anticipation of the day. Therefore we only take the relativistic quadrupole moments into account:

[formula]

We define the PN part of the mass density [formula] and the total mass density

[formula]

Lemma 2 The rigid PN spin vector of body A (see Eq. ([\ref=12gt])) can be reduced to

[formula]

Substituting Eqs. ([\ref=3gt]) and ([\ref=17gt]) for the PN part of Eq. ([\ref=12gt]), integrating by parts, using the surface integration for whole body A to be zero and taking some STF formulae, we obtained Eq. ([\ref=21gt]).

We define the PN self-part and PN external part of current density as

[formula]

Both of Σcself and Σcext as well as Σc itself are spatially compact-supported. When tidal moments GL and HL are equal to zero, Σc and Σcself / c2 form the PN self-part of spin vector. We can define

[formula]

then Eq. ([\ref=21gt]) becomes

[formula]

By comparing the Newtonian definition of spin with Eq. ([\ref=25gt]), [formula] is the fully PN quantity.

We add [formula] to both sides of Eq. ([\ref=16gt]) and have

[formula]

Now we construct the model of the PN rigid body by constraint on [formula] and [formula] to satisfy

[formula]

The relation (Eq.([\ref=27gt])) is our most important assumption for PN rigid body. Considering that [formula] and [formula] are expressed by Σc and Σ, which are related to Tαβ in the DSX scheme, then Eq. ([\ref=27gt]) is also constraint to Tαβ. When 1 / c2 terms are neglected, Eq. ([\ref=27gt]) goes to Eq. ([\ref=3gt]). Later we will see that only in this model PN mass quadrupole moments and the moment of inertia tensors satisfy the similar Newtonian key relations as in Eq. ([\ref=6gt]). We were not surprised with the appearance of the time derivative of Σ in Eq. ([\ref=27gt]), since in the DSX scheme Tαβ can be fully represented by Σ and Σa and their derivatives without difficulty [\cite=xu01]. In the interdependencies described by Thorne and Gürsel [\cite=thor83] and Klioner [\cite=klio97], they have their own models of the rigid body by another constraint to Tαβ. By comparing the constrained equations (to see Eq.(A7) in [\cite=thor83] (or Eq.(7) in [\cite=klio97]) and Eq.(8) in [\cite=klio97]) with Eq. ([\ref=27gt]), we see that Eq. ([\ref=27gt]) is more complicated, but still reasonable.

Substituting Eq. ([\ref=27gt]) for Eq. ([\ref=25gt]), we obtain the linear relation between the PN spin vector of the rigid body and the angular velocity:

[formula]

where the moment of inertia tensor is

[formula]

in which [formula] is defined in Eq. ([\ref=20gt]).

By comparing Eq. ([\ref=31gt]) with Eq. ([\ref=19gt]), we have

[formula]

Eq. ([\ref=32gt]) is the key relation between the PN mass quadrupole moment (rigid BD moment) and the PN moment of inertia tensor. It is just this relation that makes the model of the rigid body very useful and applicable on the PN level as shown in the Newtonian case. This is the first time that we have obtained the PN key relation in this paper. Making use of the extended 1PN continuity equation Eq. ([\ref=26gt]), we immediately have

[formula]

PN [formula] satisfies a similar relation as ([\ref=33gt]). From Eq. ([\ref=33gt]) the behavior of the PN Iab (and also PN Mab) in our rigid model are just like the Newtonian version (Eq. ([\ref=9gt])), i.e. Iab and Mab rigidly rotate as a whole.

Eq. ([\ref=33gt]) means that we always can introduce a rotation matrix Pia(T), which is a time-dependent orthogonal matrix and transform the PN reference system (RS) to the corotating reference system with rigid body (RS+). Pia(T) can be constructed by the rotational angular velocity Ωa of rigid body according to the relation: [formula] ([\cite=brum95]). In the new corotating coordinates we get

[formula]

where [formula]. Pia satisfies the following relations: PiaPja  =  δij, PiaPib  =  δab and dPia / dT  =  εabcΩbPic (here we use Ωb to substitute for ωj in [\cite=brum95]). The proof is easy by means of ([\ref=33gt]). Eq. ([\ref=33agt]) shows it is possible to introduce the PN Tisserand reference system.

At last, we should emphasize that the calculation of the PN moment of inertia tensor Eq. ([\ref=31gt]) is not too difficult, although the constraint relation on [formula] and [formula] in Eq. ([\ref=27gt]) in the model of the PN rigid body is complicated. In practical problems, from our PN rigid spin, the PN moment of inertia tensor (Eqs. ([\ref=30gt])- ([\ref=32gt])) it is possible to define the three principal axes of the body, the spin axis, rotation axis and figure axis as described in the Newtonian theory, which we will discuss in a separate paper in the future.

In conclusion, the rigid BD (PN) mass multipole moments Eq. ([\ref=18gt]) and the rigid PN spin moment Eq. ([\ref=25gt]) are discussed in this paper. We successfully have constructed a new PN model of the rigid body in which the constraint on [formula] and [formula] satisfies Eq. ([\ref=27gt]). Our PN rigid body model will reduce to the Newtonian one when all of 1 / c2 terms are neglected. Most of relations in our PN rigid body model, such as the spin vector proportional to the angular velocity Ω (Eq. ([\ref=30gt])), the definition on the moment of inertia tensor (Eq. ([\ref=31gt])), the key relation between the mass quadrupole moment and the moment of inertia tensor (Eq. ([\ref=32gt])), the rigidly rotating formulae of Iab and Mab (to see Eq. ([\ref=33gt])) are similar to the Newtonian rigid body model where the corresponding relations are mentioned at the beginning of this paper. Especially, the PN key relation between Mab and Iab might be applied to the practical problems in geodynamics and astronomy in the future, e.g. the discussion on the relativistic effects of the nutation and precession.
