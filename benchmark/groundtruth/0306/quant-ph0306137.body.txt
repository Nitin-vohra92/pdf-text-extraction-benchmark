Detection of entanglement and Bell's inequality violation

Since the well-known debate of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen [\cite=EPR35] with Schrödinger [\cite=Sch35] about the completeness of quantum mechanics, entangled states have intrigued physicists for decades. In particular, in recent years entangled states have become the key ingredient in the rapidly expanding field of quantum information science, with remarkable prospective applications such as quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography, quantum dense coding and parallel computation [\cite=pre98] [\cite=nielsen] [\cite=zeilinger]. However, the intrinsic nature of entanglement is by no means fully understood and the theory is far from complete. Moreover, from a practical point of view, even if a perfect entangled state has been generated in a laboratory we cannot guarantee its entangled character after interaction with the environment, due to unavoidable quantum noise (e.g. in long distance quantum communication). Thus efficient detection of entanglement is crucial for various quantum information tasks.

In 1964, John Bell showed that no local hidden-variable theory can reproduce all of the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics [\cite=Bell64]. This was developed further in the form of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality (CHSH-Bell inequality) for experimentally testing nonlocal quantum correlation between two separated entangled particles [\cite=CHSH], and was first demonstrated experimentally by Aspect et al [\cite=Aspect]. In general, however, we have to take into account all possible settings for all the local observables that appear in the Bell inequality to test its violation. This is not efficient experimentally if we have no prior knowledge of a given state. Also, there are some entangled states which do not violate the Bell inequality, such as some of the Werner states [\cite=werner89]. In this case an alternative method is to use quantum state tomography [\cite=tomog1] [\cite=tomog2] to obtain the complete density matrix for a quantum state and then apply certain known sufficient or necessary entanglement criteria. (For recent good reviews we refer to [\cite=lbck00] [\cite=3hreview] [\cite=terhal01] and references therein.) Among these, the Peres-Horodecki criterion [\cite=peres] [\cite=3hPLA223], the recent realignment criterion [\cite=ru02] [\cite=Chen02] [\cite=chenPLA02] and its multipartite generalization "the generalized partial transposition criterion" [\cite=chenPLA02] are three strong operationally-friendly entanglement criteria which can fully recognize entanglement in [formula] and [formula] systems as well as distinguish most bound entangled states (which are not distillable) in higher dimensions. Moreover, we can use Wootters's elegant formula to calculate the entanglement of formation for two qubits [\cite=wo98]. The big disadvantage of these methods is that we have to make a large number of measurements (42 - 1 = 15 parameters for two qubits) to determine the complete density matrix.

Recently, much effort has been devoted to finding ways to detect the entanglement directly without having to measure the whole density matrix. For pure states, a possible optimal strategy is given in [\cite=sanhue00]. Horodecki and Ekert proposed a method based on structural physical approximations and collective measurements that can be applied to mixed states [\cite=Horo-Ekert]. For 2 qubits this only needs 4 parameters to determine the degree of entanglement [\cite=horo0111082], but in practice it requires the construction of quantum gates and networks, which is not easy to implement with present experimental technology. If, however, we are given some prior knowledge of a quantum state, a few local measurements are enough to detect entanglement for two or three qubits and certain bound entangled states [\cite=guhne]. This has been generalized [\cite=pit-rubin] to higher dimensions and some families of n qubits by making use of the geometrical character of entanglement witnesses [\cite=ter] [\cite=lew00] [\cite=lew01] [\cite=sanpera01]. For depolarized states of bipartite systems in arbitrary dimensions there is another scheme which only requires three local measurements [\cite=amp02]. However, these procedures all require some prior knowledge of the quantum state and are only efficient for special classes of states, so they are of limited use in realistic quantum information processing.

In this Letter we develop a new method of entanglement detection for two qubits which requires only a few local measurements and no prior knowledge of the quantum state. We also show its relationship with the CHSH-Bell inequality and the entanglement measure in terms of the concurrence [\cite=wo98]. With the experimental technology currently available it should not be too difficult to implement the test.

In Hilbert space [formula] it is well known that we can represent the density matrix of any two qubits by the bases in terms of the Kronecker product of the Pauli matrices, as follows:

[formula]

where σ0 is the identity operator and σ1,2,3 are the standard Pauli matrices. Here Rij is real and can be calculated as [formula] since Tr(σiσj) = 2δij and δij is the Kronecker delta symbol. Thus R is a [formula] real matrix and a representation for the original density matrix ρ. For convenience, we denote the [formula] sub-matrix
