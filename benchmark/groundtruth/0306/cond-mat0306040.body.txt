Comment on "Crystal Structure and Pair Potentials: A Molecular-Dynamics Study"

Parrinello and Rahman[\cite=pr] proposed a molecular dynamics (PRMD) for crystal structure under external constant pressure in 1980. Many simulations of structure phase transitions induced by external forces have been carried out with it even till recently[\cite=Mart] [\cite=Rou] [\cite=Mor] [\cite=Tra], especially after it was combined with the well-known Car-Parrinello MD. It uses the scaled particle position vectors [formula] [formula] as generalized coordinates, defined by

[formula]

where [formula] is the ith particle position vector, [formula], [formula] and  [formula] are the cell edge vectors, the matrix [formula], and T is the transpose. It is obvious that using either [formula] or [formula] will produce the same results in physics. It further uses

[formula]

as the particles' kinetic energy, while the true kinetic energy for particles is

[formula]

where mi is the ith particle's mass. The PRMD starts from the Lagrangian L introduced as

[formula]

where Î¦ is the potential energy among particles and [formula] is the Lagrangian associated with [formula], [formula], and external pressure and [formula] has no contribution to the particles' dynamical equations. The aim of this comment is to check whether the chosen kinetic energy is appropriate by comparing the dynamical equations for particles with the Newton's Second Law

[formula]

with the net force [formula] acting on particle i. In order to interpret the Eq. (2) of the PRMD's original paper[\cite=pr] accurately, especially the force term, let us deduce it again in the following three case steps.

Case 1, from the Lagrangian dynamical equation, we can easily reproduce Eq. ([\ref=c5]) by using [formula] as "generalized coordinates" and using the complete kinetic energy Eq. ([\ref=c3]) to replace [formula] in Eq. ([\ref=c6] with

[formula]

Case 2, let us use [formula] as generalized coordinates and still use the complete kinetic energy of Eq. ([\ref=c3]). Combining Eq. ([\ref=c1]) and ([\ref=c7]), we obtain [formula]. By also using of [formula] and [formula], the Lagrangian dynamical equation, [formula], becomes

[formula]

which is equivalent to Eq. ([\ref=c5]).

Case 3, as in the PRMD, let us use [formula] as generalized coordinates and use the incomplete kinetic energy of Eq. ([\ref=c2]). Similar to the above case, with [formula], the particle's dynamical equation becomes

[formula]

which is the same as the Eq. (2) of the PRMD's original paper[\cite=pr], but different from Eq. ([\ref=c5]). The discrepancy can be found in between [formula] and [formula]. So the incomplete kinetic energy of Eq. ([\ref=c2]) is in-appropriate.

If the complete kinetic energy of Eq. ([\ref=c3]) is used, the first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (4) of the PRMD's original paper[\cite=pr] will disappear in physics. Anyhow, the PRMD is correct for crystal structure when all accelerations and velocities are zero.
