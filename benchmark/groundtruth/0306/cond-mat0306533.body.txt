In their Comment [\cite=min02], Mineev and Champel have argued that our results are incorrect because of the simultaneous neglect of both non-linear and non-local terms in our theory. We disagree with this statement and point out that while Ref. [\cite=min02] argue that these terms should be included, they do not give a convincing physical argument that these terms are important at low fields. In the following, we explicitly show that non-linear and non-local terms can be safely ignored near Hc1 where our results are valid. Furthermore, our results agree with the assertion of Ref. [\cite=min02] that there is no true A to B phase transition in the vortex phase. In Ref. [\cite=agt02], we refer to the diverging correlation length that describes the A to B transition in the Meissner phase.

To justify our claims, we give the missing steps between Eq. 2 and Eq. 3 of Ref. [\cite=agt02]. The expression used for Ψ- in the A phase was

[formula]

where Di  =  ∂i + i2πAi  /  Φ0. Eq. 3 in Ref. [\cite=min02] is found by setting the [formula] operator to zero. This operator cuts off the divergence that Ref. [\cite=min02] point out in their Eq. 3. We work with   /  κ  ≪  1 and within a London approach. Taking [formula], Ψ- = eiφΨ̃-, and defining the superfluid velocity as [formula] we get

[formula]

This last equation shows that Ψ̃- will be proportional to v (for small v). Consequently, for large vortex separations, the non-linear term in v on the right hand side and the terms with v on the left hand side of Eq. [\ref=eq2] can be ignored ([formula] and the derivatives give a factor 1 / λ  ≫  v for large r). After Fourier transforming and using the Maxwell relation [formula], Eq. [\ref=eq2] becomes

[formula]

Using this expression in the free energy and minimizing with respect to [formula] gives the novel London equation that forms the basis of our results

[formula]

This gives a 4-fold symmetry to the structure of a flux line out to the distance ξA, -, which diverges at the A→  B transition temperature.

Using Eq. [\ref=eq3], [formula] (take [formula] in Eq. [\ref=eq3]). This, with β1|ψ+|2  /  κ  =  1 / ξ2+ and [formula], we find:

[formula]

where d is the distance between vortices. Ref. [\cite=min02] uses this result as their Eq. 5. Hc1 marks a second order phase transition between the Meisner and the vortex phase. At this transition B = 0, which implies that as H  →  Hc1, d  →    ∞  . Consequently, sufficiently near Hc1, the non-linear term can be safely neglected. Mineev and Champel argue that d is cutoff when [formula]. Presumably, this accounts for the very small range of H over which B goes from Hc1 to zero (or d goes from λ to ∞  ). Nevertheless, this range is experimentally accessible, and furthermore, for flat plate-like samples the demagnetization factors force the applied field [formula], thus making the large d limit even more accessible. It is also argued that when Eq. 6 in Ref.[\cite=min02] is not satisfied, then non-local corrections must be included (these are terms that are [formula] or larger in Eq. 4). To counter this, we point out that Eq. 4 implies new physics at low fields (for small q and large d) while non-local terms give new physics at high fields (for large q and small d). In fact, we find non-local terms are not important when [formula]. Consequently, non-local terms also become negligible in the large d limit.
