Precision tests of the MSSM have been discussed by several groups [\cite=ALBA] [\cite=LANLUO] [\cite=ABC] [\cite=ELLIS] [\cite=CW]. Here we present for the first time the results of a global fit to the electroweak observables.

We discuss the MSSM as an effective low energy theory, irrespectively of its high energy roots, and do not use any GUT scale boundary conditions to constrain the parameters of the MSSM. On the contrary, we believe the set of low energy parameters suggested by the precision data may give an interesting hint on physics at the GUT scale.

Our strategy is analogous to the one often used for the SM: in terms of the best measured observables  GF,   αEM,  MZ  and the less well known   mt,  αs(MZ)  and the large number of additional free parameters in the MSSM such as  tan β,  MA,  soft SUSY breaking scalar masses, trilinear couplings etc. we calculate in the MSSM the observables  MW,   all partial widths of  Z0  and all asymetries at the  Z0  pole. This calculation is performed in the on-shell renormalization scheme [\cite=HOL] [\cite=HOLL] [\cite=MY_H] and with the same precision as the analogous calculation in the SM, i.e. we include all supersymmetric oblique and process dependent one-loop corrections and also the leading higher order effects.

Similar programme has often been discussed in the context of the SM [\cite=ALBA] [\cite=LANER] [\cite=EWG] with the parameters  mt,  αs(MZ)  and Mh  (or some of them) to be determined by a fit to the data. Let us first review the results in the SM with the emphasis on those features which are relevant for the supersymmetric extension.

The experimental input (i.e. experimental values for the electroweak observables, their errors and correlation matrices) used in the fits is summarized in ref. [\cite=EWG]. For the top quark mass we use the CDF result  [formula] GeV [\cite=CDF_MT]. In the most recent data of ref. [\cite=EWG] [\cite=MORIOND_95] there are two significant changes compared to the data of the Glasgow conference [\cite=GLA] [\cite=MW]: the central value of  MW  and of  A0 ~ bFB  have increased and they now read  [formula] GeV,  [formula].

In Table 1 we present the results of our global fit without and with the SLD result for the electron left-right asymetry [\cite=SLD] included. In both cases the lower limits on  Mh  come from the unsuccesful direct Higgs boson search.

Table 1. Results of the fits to the data [\cite=EWG]. All masses in GeV.

In the following, in fits in the MSSM we do not include the SLD result.

The fitted value for  Mh   results in a very transparent way from a combination of effects which can be organized into the following two-step description [\cite=MY_SMH]. A fit to the measured  [formula] GeV  [\cite=MORIOND_95] and to all measured electroweak observables but   [formula]   gives  χ2  values which are almost independent of the value of the top quark mass  mt   in the broad range (150-200 GeV) and with the best value of   log Mh  which is almost linearly correlated with  mt.   This is shown in Fig.1. The most recent experimental results [\cite=EWG] [\cite=MORIOND_95], in particular the increase in the central value of  MW  by  100 MeV  and the new measurement of  A0 ~ bFB,  evolved in the direction of requiring smaller  Mh  for a given, fixed  mt  (or larger  mt  for a given, fixed  Mh).

The  (mt,Mh)  correlation is the most solid result of the fits which does not depend on whether  Rb  and/or  mt  measurement of the CDF [\cite=CDF_MT] are included into the fits. It points toward relatively light Higgs boson for  mt  in the range  (170  -  180) GeV.

The  χ2  is flat as a function of  mt   unless  Rb   and/or the directly measured in Fermilab mass of the top quark are included into the fit. These are the only two measured observables which in the present case introduce visible  χ2  dependence as a function of  mt   and can, therefore, put indirectly (by constraining  mt)  relevant overall limit on the Higgs mass  Mh. This is also clearly seen in Fig.1.

Finally we can interpret the SM fits as the MSSM fits with all superpartners heavy enough to be decoupled. Supersymmetry then just provides a rationale for a light Higgs boson: Mh  ~  O(100 GeV). We can conclude that the MSSM with heavy enough superpartners is expected to give a perfect fit to the precision electroweak data, with [formula] GeV  (depending slightly on the value of  tan β)  and moreover mt  <  185 GeV at 95 % C.L.

This is seen in Fig.2 where we show the  χ2  values in the MSSM with the proper dependence of  Mh  on  mt,  tan β  and SUSY parameters included [\cite=ZWIR], for a fit of  mt  and   αs(MZ)  with all SUSY mass parameters fixed at 1.5 TeV. The  χ2  values in the minima are exactly the same as in the SM fit !

It is clear from this comparison, that the only room for improvement in the MSSM compared to the SM is in the value of  Rb. We can ask the following two questions:

a) can we improve  Rb  without destroying the excellent fit to the other observables?

b) if we achieve this goal, what are the limits on sparticle masses?

Moreover it is well known that additional contributions to   ΓZ0  →  b  would lower the fitted value of   αs(MZ)  [\cite=BV] [\cite=SHIF], in better agreement with its determination from low energy data [\cite=LOW].

We begin with a brief overview of the SUSY corrections to the electroweak observables. Although the MSSM contains many free SUSY parameters, there are remarkable regularities in SUSY corrections. Following our strategy of calculating all electroweak observables in terms of  GF,  MZ  and   αEM(0)  one can establish the following "theorems" for the predictions in the MSSM:

1.) (MW)MSSM  ≥  (MW)SM. As explained in ref.[\cite=MY_DR], its origin lies in additional sources of the custodial SUV(2) violation in the squark and slepton sectors:

[formula]

where [formula], which contribute to Δρ with the same sign as the t  -  b mass splitting. It should be stressed that the supersymmetric prediction for MW is merely sensitive to ML and ML - masses of the left-handed sleptons and third generation left-handed squarks. The dependence on the right-handed sfermion masses enters only through the left-right mixing. This also means that the predicted MW is almost insensitive to the masses of squarks of the first two generations: in their left-handed components there is no source of large SUV(2) violation. Also, the predictions for MW are rather weakly dependent on the chargino and neutralino masses mC±, mN0 and the Higgs sector parameters . 2.) Another effect of supersymmetric corrections is that   [formula] where [formula]  can be determined from the on-resonance forward-backward asymmetries

[formula]

with  xf  =  1  -  4|Qf| sin 2θf. In general, in the on-shell renormalization scheme and with the loop corrections included we get:

[formula]

where κUN contains universal "oblique" corrections and ΔκNON - genuine (nonuniversal) vertex corrections which are in this case negligibly small. By using explicit form of κUN  one can derive the following relation:

[formula]

We see therefore, that the supersymmetric predictions for   [formula]  are correlated with the predictions for  MW   through the value of  Δρ   and they are sensitive to the same supersymmetric parameters.

3.) Similarly, the asymmetries in the quark channel are given by the product

[formula]

If   [formula]   and  ( sin 2θb)MSSM = ( sin 2θb)SM  -  δ   then it is easy to show that

[formula]

Thus, supersymmetric corrections to  A0 ~ FB  are essentially determined by the corrections to  [formula]  and give the third "theorem":   (A0 ~ FB)MSSM  ≥  (A0 ~ FB)SM.

At this point it is important to observe that the trends in the MSSM expressed by the above three theorems can only make the comparison of the MSSM predictions with the data worse than in the SM (as for  mt  >  160 GeV  they go against the trend of the data!). Thus we can expect to get relevant lower limits on the left-handed squark and slepton masses, which are the parameters most relevant for the observables  MW,  [formula]  and   A0 ~ FB  (of course, for large enough masses, we recover the SM predictions). These limits are amplified by the dependence of  ΓZ   on  ML  and  ML.  As discussed above, the sensitivity of the each one of those observables to the other parameters is weaker but accumulates itself and becomes non-negligible in the global fit. The most important and interesting is the dependence on the chargino mass and its composition. One can see that a light higgsino (and only higgsino) does not worsen the predictions for   MW,  [formula],  A0 ~ FB  and, for a heavy top quark and light Higgs boson it can significantly improve the fit to   ΓZ  [\cite=BARB] (this is a  Z0-wave function renormalization effect which acts similarly to a heavier Higgs boson for heavier t quark i.e. its contribution makes  ΓZ  smaller).

Finally, let us discuss the corrections to the  [formula]   vertex which contribute to the observables  Rb  and  sin 2θb.   The latter can be extracted e.g. from  A0 ~ FB  once   [formula]  is known or, more conveniently, from the measurements of the the polarized forward-backward asymmetry   Apol ~ bFB  =  Ab  at SLAC. The vertex corrections contribute to   ΔκNON  in eq. ([\ref=eqn:sin_for]) and can dramatically change the result for  sin 2θb  compared to its value predicted in the SM and can give relevant contribution to  Rb.

In the MSSM there are three types of important corrections to the vertex   [formula]  [\cite=BF]:

a) charged and neutral Higgs boson exchange; for low   tan β   and light  CP - odd Higgs boson  A0  this contribution is negative (the   ΓZ  →  b  is decreasing below its SM value) whereas for very light  A0  (50 - 80 GeV) and very large values of the   tan β   ([formula])  the interplay of charged and neutral Higgs bosons is strongly positive;

b) chargino - stop loops; for heavy top quark and low   tan β   they can contribute significantly (and positively) for light chargino (if higgsino-like) and light right-handed top squark (this follows from the Yukawa chargino-stop-bottom coupling); in the case of large tan β this contribution is smaller than for small  tan β  but the total contribution to the  Z0b  vertex can be amplified by

c) neutralino - sbottom (if light) loops.

Thus, in the MSSM the value of  Rb  can in principle be significantly larger than in the SM for very low or very large values of  tan β,   light (higgsino-like) chargino, and  t̃R  and/or very light   A0  (for large  tan β)  [\cite=KKW]. It is insensitive to   ML  and  ML.

In summary, in MSSM the electroweak observables exhibit certain "decoupling": all of them but  Rb  are sensitive mainly to the left-handed slepton and third generation squark masses and depend weakly on the right-handed squarkand slepton masses, gaugino and Higgs sectors; on the contrary,  Rb  depends strongly just on the latter set of variables and very weakly on the former. We can then indeed expect to increase the value of  Rb   without destroying the perfect fit of the SM to the other observables. However, chargino, right-handed stop and charged Higgs boson masses also are crucial variables for the decay  b  →  sγ   and this constraint has to be included [\cite=BSG_BG]. In addition, in the parameters space which gives light higgsino-like charginos also neutralinos are higgsino-like and the contribution of  Z0  →  N0iN0j   to the total  Z0  width must be included (we also impose the constraint that  N01  is the LSP).

For large  tan β  the value of  Rb  can be enhanced with very light   C±,  t̃R  and/or  MA  ~  50  -  70 GeV.  The chargino-stop loop contribution to  BR(b  →  sγ)  reads:

[formula]

and, unless  [formula],  it is very large for  mC,   Mt̃R  <  O(100GeV).   For a light  A0,  the charged Higgs boson contribution to  BR(b  →  sγ)  is also too large [\cite=BMMP] and has to be cancelled by the chargino-stop loop contribution. Note however, that given the order of magnitude of the latter, this cancellation may occur for rather heavy chargino and/or  t̃R  and therefore small   Rb,  or, again, for  At  <  O(MZ).

Thus, one obtains acceptable  BR(b  →  sγ)  due to cancellations between  W±,  H±  and  C±  and   t̃R  loops. The net impact on the allowed parameters space depends quite strongly on the values of  mt  and  αs(MZ).   Generically, the values of  BR(b  →  sγ)  are in the lower edge of the allowed range.

Let us present some quantitative results. We have fitted the value of  αs,  tan β,  mt  and SUSY parameters. The first observation is that the  χ2  is generically always better than in the SM and this is due to the improvement in   Rb.   The dependence of the  χ2  on  tan β  for several values of   mt  (and scanned over the other parameters) is shown in Fig.3. The best fit is obtained in two regions of very low (close to the quasi-IR fixed point for a given top quark mass) and very large  (  ~  mt / mb)   tan β  values. We get, respectively   mt  =  170+ 10- 5 GeV  and  [formula] GeV.   The values of  Rb are in the range  0.218-0.219.

The global dependence of the  χ2  on  mt   is shown in Fig. 4b and gives  mt  =  166+ 12- 9 GeV.  For the best fit in the low   tan β  region we obtain strong bounds on chargino and the lightest stop masses. They are shown in Fig.5. In the large  tan β  region the most relevant variable is the pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass  MA   and we get  MA  <  70 GeV  at  1σ  level in the other analyses [\cite=SOLA].

Finally, an important issue is the obtained value of  αs(MZ).   It is well known [\cite=BV] [\cite=SHIF] that additionaal contributions to   ΓZ  →  b  should lower the fitted value of   αs(MZ).  This effect is indeed observed in our fits and brings the obtained value of  αs(MZ)  closer to the values obtained from low energy data [\cite=LOW]. In Fig. 6a we show  χ2  values as a function of  αs(MZ)  for different values of  tan β   and in Fig. 6b the global dependence of  χ2  on  αs(MZ).   For low and intermediate  tan β  values we get  [formula]  and for  tan β  ≈  mt / mb,  [formula].

Finally in Fig.7 we show the lower  1  and  2σ  limits on left-handed sbottom and left-handed slepton masses for different   mt  and  tan β.

In summary, a MSSM fit to the electroweak observables is excellent   (χ2  ~  7.2  for 15 d.o.f.; in the SM we have [\cite=MY_SMH]  χ2  =  11).  This is due to higher than in the SM values of  Rb  obtained in the MSSM, without destroying the agreement in the other observables. The best fit selects very particular regions of the parameters space: either very low or very large values of  tan β  and correspondingly, chargino (higgsino-like) and stop or the  CP - odd  Higgs boson masses are within the reach of LEP 2. Moreover the best fit gives  αs(MZ) = 0.118+ 0.005- 0.010,  a value which is lower than the one obtained from the SM fits and in agreement with the low energy data. Low values of  αs(MZ)  is correlated with the presence of the additional contribution to the  ΓZ  →  b  [\cite=BV] [\cite=SHIF].
