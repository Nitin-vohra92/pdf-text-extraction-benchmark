Introduction

Dynamical system, constrained on a D-dimensional manifold, MD, which is now supposed to be given by the equation,

[formula]

where [formula] is the D + 1-dimensional Cartesian coordinate, can be described classically as follows: [formula] is assumed to obey

[formula]

where we have written [formula] for the usual [formula] vector. The equation of motion in a flat D + 1-dimensional space,

[formula]

with [formula] being a potential, is modified to

[formula]

in MD, where [formula] is a projection operator,

[formula]

onto the plane perpendicular to the vector [formula]: [formula]. Here and hereafter repeated indices imply summation. The significance of ( [\ref=eq:{4a}] ) is easily grasped; since the motion is restricted on MD so that any deviation to the direction [formula] must be suppressed.

It is well-known that the Lagrangian,

[formula]

with λ being the multiplier, leads to the equations ( [\ref=eq:{4a}] ) and ( [\ref=eq:{1a}] ). Also the canonical formalism can be developed under the guidance of Dirac[\cite=Dirc]: regard ( [\ref=eq:{1a}] ) as the (primary) constraint

[formula]

and consider the consistency condition: a Hamiltonian,

[formula]

gives

[formula]

thus to find

[formula]

(Here {A,B} designates the Poisson bracket.) They belong to the second class:

[formula]

on account of ( [\ref=eq:{2a}] ), which enables us to obtain the Dirac bracket,

[formula]

Therefore we find

[formula]

those which correctly reproduce the equation ( [\ref=eq:{4a}] ).

As for quantum mechanics, a recipe of path integral quantization had been given by Faddeev [\cite=Fadd] and later by Senjanovic [\cite=Senj](FS): the FS-formula reads formally

[formula]

with

[formula]

and [formula] Here [formula] and [formula] are functional measures which must be specified somehow. The issue is then how to define the above functional measure properly to confirm the well-defined form of ( [\ref=eq:{14a}] ): the most well-known and primitive approach is to discretize the time, obtaining

[formula]

In this approach it was stressed by the present author [\cite=FK] that the mid-point prescription is privileged in the case of D-dimensional sphere SD given as

[formula]

We try to generalize the case in this paper.

In section 2, we review the SD case. With this in mind, a generic case [formula] is discussed in section 3. The next section 4 deals with operators obtained from the path integral formula, then the final section 5 is devoted to discussion.

The case of D-dimensional sphere

The D-dimensional sphere SD is given, in view of ( [\ref=eq:{17a}] ), by

[formula]

The secondary constraint ( [\ref=eq:{10a}] ) is read as

[formula]

The FS-formula ( [\ref=eq:{14a}] ) and ( [\ref=eq:{15a}] ) in a discretized form is found as

[formula]

with

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Here we have employed the mid-point prescription ( [\ref=eq:{6b}] ) to the argument of Hamiltonian, which can be interpreted as a consequence of the Weyl ordering [\cite=Coh][\cite=K]. The issue is to fix the form of φ2(j): the correct form has been found also as the mid-point type [\cite=FK]:

[formula]

The way to ( [\ref=eq:{7b}] ) can be convinced by the following discussion.

Consider T = 0 case: put N = 1 in ( [\ref=eq:{3b}] ) to obtain

[formula]

where we have written [formula] and [formula] for [formula] and [formula] respectively and set the form of ( [\ref=eq:{2b}] ) as

[formula]

with α being a parameter [\cite=K] to be determined. Decompose the [formula]-vector such that

[formula]

where

[formula]

are the parallel and the perpendicular components to the vector [formula]. Then perform the [formula]-integration to find

[formula]

where

[formula]

Therefore the D-dimensional δ-function, in the right hand side of ( [\ref=eq:{12b}] ), implies

[formula]

with the aid of ( [\ref=eq:{5a}] ). The solution is

[formula]

since the second term of ( [\ref=eq:{14b}] ) vanishes:

[formula]

owing to the constraint ( [\ref=eq:{1b}] ). But an additional point emerges if α  ≠  0

[formula]

Thus in α  ≠  0 the δ-function in ( [\ref=eq:{12b}] ) is double-valued. To avoid the situation we must take α = 0, that is, ( [\ref=eq:{9b}] ) turns out to be ( [\ref=eq:{7b}] ).

A path integral formula in generic cases

In this section we wish to generalize the previous result to MD, given by [formula]. Start from ( [\ref=eq:{3b}] ) by putting

[formula]

and study the form of [formula]. The [formula]-integral in this case becomes

[formula]

where

[formula]

which is again the consequence of the decomposition of [formula]'s into the parallel and the perpendicular components with respect to a (still unknown) vector [formula].

According to the foregoing discussion, ( [\ref=eq:{14b}] ) ~   ( [\ref=eq:{17b}] ), a sufficient condition for a single-valued δ-function on MD is read from ( [\ref=eq:{3c}] )

[formula]

A simple solution therefore is

[formula]

(This would make sense; since a naive continuum limit, defined by [formula], [formula], implies [formula], yielding the classical result ( [\ref=eq:{10a}] ). ) Write

[formula]

and expand the right hand side of ( [\ref=eq:{5c}] ) with respect to [formula] to obtain

[formula]

where [formula] denotes differentiation with respect to [formula]. With this in mind a path integral formula on MD is found as

[formula]

Needless to say, ( [\ref=eq:{1c}] ) with ( [\ref=eq:{7c}] ) matches ( [\ref=eq:{7b}] ), the SD case, where symmetry is higher so that the mid-point prescription was valid. But as can be recognized from ( [\ref=eq:{7c}] ) there is no privilege of the mid-point prescription in general cases.

Before closing this section let us argue another aspect of the relation ( [\ref=eq:{2c}] ) with ( [\ref=eq:{7c}] ): on MD, xa can be expressed by some coordinate, say, θi [formula]:

[formula]

There should be an orthonormal as well as complete set, Yn(θ):

[formula]

[formula]

where n represents generic labels and g(θ) is the determinant of the induced metric,

[formula]

Specifically, Yn(θ) may be an eigenfunction of the Laplace-Beltrami operator:

[formula]

Suppose that Hamiltonian is given by

[formula]

where the caret denotes operators, then the Feynman kernel,

[formula]

can be expressed as "path integral": by inserting the identities, ( [\ref=eq:{10c}] ) and ( [\ref=eq:{11c}] ), which are now read as

[formula]

[formula]

with [formula] being the identity operator,

[formula]

and [formula], ( [\ref=eq:{15c}] ) becomes

[formula]

However the expression of ( [\ref=eq:{20c}] ) is unsatisfactory as a "path integral" formula if MD is nontrivial, gij  ≠  δij; since some of the labels are discrete so that we are left with summation not integration. Moreover Yn(θ) is generally far from a plane wave form: in a trivial case, gij  =  δij, (which is given by an [formula] linear in [formula],) Yn(θ) is read as,

[formula]

(n and θ correspond to [formula] and [formula] respectively.) Therefore we obtain a usual path integral formula:

[formula]

(It might be natural, however, to think that the situation is same even in the trivial case if we work with the polar coordinate; since in which there arises the spherical harmonics, being far from the plane wave except the S1 case. But in these cases we can find a desired path integral formula consisting purely of an exponential form as well as integration by means of the canonical transformation [\cite=FK2] from the Cartesian expression ( [\ref=eq:{22c}] ).)

Now it is almost clear that the relation ( [\ref=eq:{2c}] ) with ( [\ref=eq:{7c}] ) cures the above situation for nontrivial cases: according to our discussion, the completeness condition ( [\ref=eq:{11c}] ) can be put into a plane wave type provided solely with integration:

[formula]

where from ( [\ref=eq:{7c}] )

[formula]

and the subscript M designates that [formula] and [formula] are on MD. The relation ( [\ref=eq:{23c}] ) thus can be implied as the plane wave representation of the completeness condition on MD. In other words the FS formula is a rigorous consequence from the operator formalism owing to this completeness condition ( [\ref=eq:{23c}] ).

Operators from the path integral formula

A similar consideration as in ( [\ref=eq:{8b}] ) leads us to the observation that an expectation value of some operator [formula] can be given, with the aid of the formula ( [\ref=eq:{8c}] ) with ( [\ref=eq:{7c}] ), by

[formula]

where [formula] is given by ( [\ref=eq:{24c}] ),

[formula]

and

[formula]

By noting

[formula]

then using ( [\ref=eq:{5c}] ), ( [\ref=eq:{1d}] ) becomes

[formula]

where we have introduced the notation,

[formula]

and integrated with respect to [formula]'s in a similar manner as before, to find [formula] which is combined with [formula] yielding [formula] finally. Now changing variables [formula] to [formula] and performing integration by parts, we find

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

in view of ( [\ref=eq:{6d}] ). (The subscript [formula] designates that [formula] must be put after all calculations have been done.) Also note that

[formula]

Let us calculate some examples:

(i) [formula]:

[formula]

where we have written [formula] for [formula]. This shows

[formula]

(ii) [formula]:

[formula]

where again we have put [formula]. The third term in the final expression comes from the differentiation to ( [\ref=eq:{10d}] ). (There remains no effect from differentiating the δ-function, in view of ( [\ref=eq:{9d}] ).) Finally integrating by parts with respect to the first term, while paying attention to the property of the projection operator, [formula], we obtain

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

is the momentum operator. It can be shown by an explicit calculation that ( [\ref=eq:{15d}] ) satisfies the quantum version of ( [\ref=eq:{13a}] ):

[formula]

where [formula]

(iii) [formula]: with a similar manner as above, we find

[formula]

From this we obtain

[formula]

It should be noted that [formula] unless [formula] is linear in [formula].

Discussion

In this paper we have established a form of constraints in the path integral formula given by the time discretization. The main interest is how to incorporate the classical constraint [formula] into the quantum one: the correct form can be found by requiring that the delta function be single-valued.

The conclusion is unchanged even if we take a nonstandard form of Hamiltonian instead of ( [\ref=eq:{8a}] ) such as

[formula]

provided [formula].

Therefore we have successfully described a 'local' form of the path integral formula; where the word 'local' must be attached since if manifold is nontrivial and composed of G / H there emerge induced gauge fields according to recent studies [\cite=LMT][\cite=OK]. Our formula apparently lucks these informations. There has been a trial [\cite=MT] but we are still on the way to the final goal.
