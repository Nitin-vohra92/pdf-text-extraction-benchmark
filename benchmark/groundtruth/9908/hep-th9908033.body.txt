Abstract

Grand canonical ensemble of small vortex loops emerging in the London limit of the effective Abelian-projected theory of the SU(3)-gluodynamics is investigated in the dilute gas approximation. An essential difference of this system from the SU(2)-case is the presence of two interacting gases of vortex loops. Two alternative representations for the partition function of such a grand canonical ensemble are derived, and one of them, which is a representation in terms of the integrals over vortex loops, is employed for the evaluation of the correlators of both kinds of loops in the low-energy limit.

In a recent paper [\cite=ijmpa], the grand canonical ensemble of small vortex loops, existing in the Abelian Higgs model, have been investigated. Such loops are nothing else but the 4D analogue of the vortex dipoles, which are present in the usual Ginzburg-Landau theory. In particular, it has been demonstrated that the summation over the grand canonical ensemble of small vortex loops leads to an effective Sine-Gordon type theory of the massive Kalb-Ramond field [\cite=kalb] (cf. 2D- and 3D cases studied in Refs. [\cite=23D] [\cite=kleinert]). This field describes a dual vector boson, which therefore acquires an additional mass due to the Debye screening in the gas of vortex loops. Furthermore, a representation of the partition function of such a gas directly in terms of the integral over vortex loops as well as the related effective potential of those have been discussed. Such a representation then turned out to be useful for the evaluation of the bilocal correlator of vortex loops in the low-energy limit. These calculations demonstrate the importance of treating the topological defects in the Abelian Higgs model and Ginzburg-Landau theory as forming the ensembles, rather than individual ones.

An interest to the study of vortex loops in the Abelian Higgs model is motivated by the fact that the dual Abelian Higgs model is discussed to be relevant to the description of confinement in the SU(2)-gluodynamics [\cite=suz]. This agreement is based on the method of Abelian projections [\cite=abpr] (for a recent progress see [\cite=digiacomo] [\cite=max] [\cite=reinhardt] [\cite=kondo] [\cite=wipf] [\cite=plb] [\cite=komarov] [\cite=dec] [\cite=correl2], for a review see [\cite=proc]) and the so-called Abelian dominance hypothesis [\cite=abdom], according to which off-diagonal (in the sense of the Cartan decomposition) degrees of freedom are inessential for confinement and can be disregarded. In the spirit of this hypothesis, the following partition function describing an effective 2 gauge invariant Abelian-projected theory of the realistic SU(3)-gluodynamics has been proposed [\cite=maedan]

[formula]

[formula]

Here, [formula] stands for the field strength tensor of the magnetic vector potential [formula] dual to the electric one [formula]. Next in Eq. ([\ref=1]), [formula], a = 1,2,3, are effective Higgs fields describing condensed magnetic monopoles, whose magnetic charge gm is expressed via the QCD coupling constant gQCD as gm = 4π / gQCD. Finally in Eq. ([\ref=1]),

[formula]

stand for the so-called root vectors, which play the role of the structural constants in the algebra [formula]. Here, the operators [formula] generate the Cartan subalgebra, where from now on [formula], [formula], are just the SU(3)-generators. We have also introduced the so-called step operators E±  a's (else called raising operators for positive a's and lowering operators otherwise) by redefining the rest (non-diagonal) SU(3)-generators as follows

[formula]

Clearly, these operators are non-Hermitean in the sense that [formula]. For bookkeeping purposes, it is worth listing the remaining commutation relations, completing the Lie algebra, which read

[formula]

Notice also that due to the fact that the original SU(3) group is special, the phases of the three magnetic Higgs fields are not independent and should obey the constraint [formula]. The latter one has been imposed by the introduction of the corresponding δ-function into the functional integral on the R.H.S. of Eq. ([\ref=1]).

Before proceeding with the study of the model ([\ref=1]), it is worth mentioning its certain feature owing to which this model is not quite adequate to the description of confinement in the real SU(3)-gluodynamics. Its essence is that the model ([\ref=1]) describes only the sector of the full yet unknown Abelian-projected theory of the SU(3)-gluodynamics, where antimonopoles are completely absent. Clearly, the expected full theory should contain the antimonopole sector as well. Possible interference between these two sectors is up to now unclear and should be clarified by further investigations.

In what follows, we shall be interested in the study of the model ([\ref=1]) in the London limit, i.e., the limit of infinitely large Higgs coupling constant λ. Analogously to the SU(2)-case, in this limit the model under study allows for an exact reformulation in terms of the integral over closed Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen type strings [\cite=ano] . In this limit, the radial parts of the Higgs fields can be integrated out, and the partition function ([\ref=1]) takes the form

[formula]

Next, the total phases θa's of magnetic Higgs fields should be decomposed into the singular and regular parts, θa  =  θsinga  +  θrega [\cite=plb] [\cite=komarov] [\cite=dec] (cf. also Refs. [\cite=duality] [\cite=emil] [\cite=correl2] for the SU(2)-case). Here, θsinga's describe a certain configuration of electric strings and are unambiguously related to their world-sheets Σa's according to the equation (see the above cited Refs.)

[formula]

This equation is just the covariant formulation of the 4D analogue of the Stokes theorem for the gradient of the field θa, written in the local form. In Eq. ([\ref=3]), [formula] is a vector parametrizing the world-sheet Σa with [formula] standing for the two-dimensional coordinate.

Confining and topological properties of the model ([\ref=2]) have been studied in Refs. [\cite=plb] [\cite=komarov] [\cite=dec]. This has been done by making use of the so-called path-integral duality transformation, elaborated in Refs. [\cite=kleinert] [\cite=duality] for the usual Abelian Higgs model, which casts the partition function ([\ref=2]) into the following form,

[formula]

Z=x(ξ)δ( Σ)exp,

[formula]

Z=x(ξ)Dx(ξ)×

[formula]

Σ(x)=n dσ(x(ξ))δ( x-x(ξ)).

[formula]

Z =S Dλ×

[formula]

[formula]

× { the  same  term  with  the  replacements  (1)→ (2)  and  λ→ λ }=

[formula]

sin( )= -S.

[formula]

Z= S exp{-},

which owing to Eq. ([\ref=aux]) is natural to be referred to as the representation in terms of the vortex loops. In Eq. ([\ref=8]), the effective potential of vortex loops reads

[formula]

[formula]

It is further instructive to illustrate the difference of such a partition function of two interacting gases of vortex loops from the case of Abelian-projected SU(2)-gluodynamics by studying a related representation in terms of a certain effective Sine-Gordon theory. This can be done by introducing the new integration variables [formula] and [formula], which diagonalize the quadratic form in square brackets on the R.H.S. of Eq. ([\ref=6]). Then Eqs. ([\ref=6]) and ([\ref=7]) yield

[formula]

[formula]

where we have denoted [formula] and h2μν  =  λ1μν  -  λ2μν. The partition function of the desired Sine-Gordon theory can be obtained from Eq. ([\ref=10]) by making use of the following equality

[formula]

[formula]

(cf. the R.H.S. with the quadratic part of the action of the Kalb-Ramond field on the R.H.S. of Eq. ([\ref=4]) with the field Aaμ gauged away). Substituting this equality into Eq. ([\ref=10]) and performing the rescaling [formula], we arrive at the following representation for the partition function of the grand canonical ensemble of vortex loops in terms of the local Sine-Gordon theory, equivalent to the nonlocal theory ([\ref=8]),

[formula]

[formula]

As we now see, an essential property of the obtained Sine-Gordon theory, which distinguishes it from an analogous theory describing the grand canonical ensemble of vortex loops in the Abelian-projected SU(2)-gluodynamics [\cite=ijmpa], is the presence of two interacting Kalb-Ramond fields, while in the SU(2)-case there was only one self-interacting field. Notice that upon the expansion of the cosines on the R.H.S. of Eq. ([\ref=11]), it is straightforward to see that only the interaction terms of the type [formula] survive. In another words, despite of the mixing of the Kalb-Ramond fields in the arguments of the cosines, no terms linear in any of these fields appear in the action. In particular, the masses of both Kalb-Ramond fields, M1 and M2, can be read off from Eq. ([\ref=11]) by expanding the cosines up to the quadratic terms. The result reads [formula], where [formula], [formula] are the Debye masses, and we have introduced the corresponding magnetic charges [formula], [formula].

Eqs. ([\ref=8]) and ([\ref=9]) can now be used for the evaluation of correlators of vortex loops, which due to Eq. ([\ref=aux]), are nothing else but the correlators of Saμν's. Those are calculable in the low-energy limit, [formula], by considering the real branch of the potential ([\ref=9]), i.e., extracting from the whole sum the term with n = 0. The latter one has a simple parabolic form, and in the vicinity of its minimum (corresponding to the low-energy limit) the generating functional for correlators of Saμν's reads

[formula]

where Jaμν is a source of Saμν, and [formula]. Such two Gaussian integrals can be calculated by virtue of the following equality

[formula]

[formula]

and the result reads

[formula]

The correlators of vortex loops following from this expression have the form

[formula]

and

[formula]

At this point, it is worth recalling that the original theory ([\ref=1]) is an effective theory at large distances [\cite=maedan], where the asymptotic behaviours of the obtained correlators read

[formula]

[formula]

This result illustrates how the vortex loops in the grand canonical ensemble under study are correlated to each other. Namely, their correlators decrease according to the Yukawa type law with the screening provided by the lightest of the two full masses, M2.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the grand canonical ensemble of vortex loops in the effective Abelian-projected theory of the SU(3)-gluodynamics (being treated in the dilute gas approximation) exhibits an essential property distinguishing it from the one of the Abelian-projected SU(2)-gluodynamics. Namely, it consists of two interacting subsystems, corresponding to two independent types of strings, which emerge after the Abelian projection. An average over the shapes of the vortex loops with the most general rotation- and translation invariant integration measure leads to two alternative field-theoretical representations of such a grand canonical ensemble. First of them is a representation in terms of an effective Sine-Gordon theory of two interacting Kalb-Ramond fields ([\ref=11]). It yields the (positive) contribution to the masses Ma's of the Kalb-Ramond fields coming about from the Debye screening as well as to the magnetic charges Qa's of these fields. The other representation given by Eqs. ([\ref=8]) and ([\ref=9]), which is the one in terms of the integral over the vortex loops, is useful for the evaluation of their correlators. While such a calculation is difficult to perform exactly due to the complicated form of the effective potential of the vortex loops ([\ref=9]), it turns out to be possible to perform it in the low-energy limit within an additional approximation when only the real branch of the potential is taken into account. As a result, the correlators of vortex loops have a Yukawa type asymptotic behaviours at large distances with the screening governed by the lightest of the two full masses of the Kalb-Ramond fields.

It now looks reasonable to find field-theoretical representations for the grand canonical ensembles of vortex loops emerging after the Abelian projection in the general SU(N), N > 2, case. In that case, there appear [formula] independent strings. Indeed, this is just the number of possibilities for the eigenvalues of a certain (adjointly transformed) operator, to be diagonalized during the Abelian projection, to coincide, minus one constraint imposed by the δ-function on the R.H.S. of Eq. ([\ref=1]) (with the sum over a going from 1 to N). It will therefore emerge just this amount of interacting gases of vortex loops, leading to different Debye masses. The study of this system as well as its large-N limit will be the topic of a separate publication.
