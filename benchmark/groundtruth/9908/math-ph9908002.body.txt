Introduction

The Lamé equation,

[formula]

where ł is a real parameter, and

[formula]

is the usual Jacobian elliptic function of modulus m, occupies a central position in the theory of differential equations with periodic coefficients. The study of its properties has attracted the attention of many illustrious mathematicians over the last century; classical references are [\cite=In39a] [\cite=In39] [\cite=EMOT55] [\cite=Ar64]. Basic properties of the Lamé equation are as follows. First, it arises by separation of variables in the Laplace equation in ellipsoidal coordinates. Secondly, it possesses two linearly independent 2K(k) or 4K(k)-periodic solutions (for characteristic values of E) if and only if ł is a nonnegative integer. Here [formula], and K(k) (denoted by K from now on) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind with parameter k:

[formula]

Moreover, if ł is a nonnegative integer there are exactly ł gaps in the energy spectrum, and the 2ł + 1 eigenfunctions associated to the boundaries of the allowed energy bands can be written as homogeneous polynomials of degree ł in the elliptic functions [formula], [formula], [formula]. These polynomial solutions are known as the Lamé polynomials. In the third place, for any [formula] and characteristic values of E the Lamé equation admits two linearly independent solutions of period 8K. These solutions are expressible in closed form if and only if [formula], and shall be referred to as the non-meromorphic Lamé functions. For both types of solutions, namely the Lamé polynomials for integer ł and the non-meromorphic Lamé functions for half-integer ł, the characteristic values of E are the solutions of a certain algebraic equation. We shall use the the term "algebraic" to refer to both types of solutions.

The interest of the Lamé equation is by no means restricted to its mathematical properties. In fact, several important physical applications have been recently proposed in the literature. As first remarked in [\cite=AGI83], the Lamé potential can be considered as a realistic model of a one-dimensional crystal. The Lamé equation also describes some class of fluctuations of the sphalerons in the Abelian Higgs model in 1+1 dimensions, [\cite=BB93]. The quantum fluctuations of the inflation field in certain cosmological models are determined by the Lamé equation, [\cite=KLS94] [\cite=GKLS97].

The Lamé equation appears in a natural way in several Lie-algebraic approaches to the Schrödinger equation. Early work in this direction was carried out by Alhassid, Gürsey and Iachello in [\cite=AGI83]. In this paper the Lamé equation was obtained by separation of variables in the eigenvalue equation for a Hamiltonian quadratic in the generators of [formula] written in conical coordinates. A different Lie-algebraic representation of the Lamé equation was discovered by Turbiner in [\cite=Tu89], where it was shown that for integer ł the Lamé Hamiltonian belongs to the the enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra of first-order differential operators with a finite-dimensional module of functions. It follows that a number of eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the Lamé equation can be determined algebraically, i.e., by diagonalizing the finite-dimensional matrix representing the action of the Hamiltonian in the module. This class of Hamiltonians --known in the literature as quasi-exactly solvable (QES)-- have been the subject of considerable investigation over the last decade; extensive reviews of this field can be found in [\cite=GKOqes94] [\cite=Us94] [\cite=Ol97]. In particular, it is known that several periodic potentials of physical interest --like the Razavy potential, [\cite=Ra80] [\cite=FGR99], or the so-called associated Lamé potential, [\cite=Ar64]-- possess the QES property.

In the above mentioned papers the Lamé equation was successfully algebraized only for integer values of ł, corresponding to the Lamé polynomials. A first indirect algebraization of the Lamé equation for half-integer ł was studied by Ward in [\cite=Wa87] in connection with the matrix Nahm equations. The Lamé polynomials and the non-meromorphic Lamé functions appear as solutions of some matrix-valued differential equations related to irreducible representations of [formula]. The Lamé potential (and some generalizations thereof) was revisited by Ulyanov and Zaslavskii in [\cite=UZ92]. In this paper the Lamé Hamiltonian was obtained from a non-standard realization of [formula] by first-order differential operators, leading to the algebraic solutions for integer and half-integer values of ł. In [\cite=BG93], Brihaye and Godart introduced yet another indirect algebraization scheme for half-integer values of ł based on a system of two second-order differential equations.

In this paper we shall present a new direct way to algebraize the Lamé equation which is valid for both the integer and half-integer cases. Our approach is based on the classification of one-dimensional QES potentials by González-López, Kamran, and Olver, [\cite=GKOqes94], and presents some advantages over the similar algebraization considered by Ulyanov and Zaslavskii in [\cite=UZ92]. Indeed, the 2ł + 1 algebraic points of the spectrum (corresponding to the boundaries of the energy bands for integer ł and to eigenfunctions of quasi-momentum π / (4K) for half-integer ł) are the roots of a pair of polynomials of degrees ł and ł + 1 for integer ł, or of a single polynomial of degree ł + 1 / 2 for half-integer ł. This compares to the algebraization by Ulyanov and Zaslavskii, for which one needs to find the roots of a polynomial of degree 2ł + 1. In the second place, it leads to new general expressions for the algebraic solutions of the Lamé equation in terms of Chebyshev polynomials and of a certain family of weakly-orthogonal polynomials. It should be emphasized that in the algebraization schemes mentioned above explicit solutions are presented only for low (integer or half-integer) values of ł.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the basic definitions and show how the Lamé potential can be obtained using the classification of González-López, Kamran, and Olver. The algebraization by Ulyanov and Zaslavskii is briefly discussed in this setting. Section 3 is devoted to the integer case. We find an expansion in terms of Chebyshev polynomials which reveals the structure of the classical Lamé polynomials. This expansion is used to compute the Lamé polynomials for [formula]. In the last section we analyze the half-integer case. We obtain an expansion of the non-meromorphic Lamé functions using again Chebyshev polynomials, and relate our formulae to the classical results of Ince. In particular, we check Ince's formulas for ł  ≤  3 / 2, and study in detail the case ł = 5 / 2.

Algebraizations of the Lamé equation

If n is a non-negative integer, it is a standard fact that the differential operators

[formula]

are the basis of a representation of the Lie algebra [formula] in the space Pn of polynomials of degree at most n in the variable z, [\cite=Tu88] [\cite=GKOnorm93]. As a consequence, any differential operator H which is a polynomial in the operators [\eqref=Js] preserves the space Pn (the converse is also true; cf. [\cite=Tu92] [\cite=FK98]). In particular, n + 1 eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of H can be computed algebraically, simply by diagonalizing the finite-dimensional operator obtained by restricting H to Pn. More generally, if we perform the change of variable

[formula]

and consider the operator

[formula]

where μ(z) is a nowhere vanishing function, then H obviously leaves invariant the (n + 1)-dimensional vector space

[formula]

Consequently, we can again compute n + 1 eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of H in an algebraic way, by considering its restriction to the finite-dimensional space μPn. We shall say that such an operator H is quasi-exactly solvable (or, for short, QES), [\cite=TU87]. Of particular physical interest is the case in which the operator H is a polynomial of degree two in the generators [\eqref=Js], which we shall write as

[formula]

Such an operator can be expressed as

[formula]

where (see [\cite=GKOnorm93])

[formula]

Note that, using the Casimir identity

[formula]

we can take c+  - = 0 without loss of generality. It can be shown, [\cite=GKOnorm93], that if P is positive then it is always possible to transform (at least locally) the operator H into a Schrödinger operator (or Hamiltonian)

[formula]

by an appropriate change of variable and gauge transformation [\eqref=cv]-[\eqref=gauge]. More precisely, the inverse of the change of variable [\eqref=cv] is given by

[formula]

while the gauge factor is proportional to

[formula]

The potential V(x) can be expressed in terms of the coefficients of the gauge Hamiltonian H as follows

[formula]

where the prime denotes derivative with respect to z.

All one-dimensional potentials whose Hamiltonian is QES (in the precise sense explained above) have been completely classified in Ref. [\cite=GKOqes94], modulo a constant translation of the space coordinate x. In particular, the Lamé equation [\eqref=lame] can be obtained from the third family of periodic potentials (with ν = 1), given by

[formula]

Note that, for later convenience, the above notation is slightly different from that of Ref. [\cite=GKOqes94]. The potential [\eqref=case3] is obtained from [\eqref=veq] when

[formula]

Indeed, from [\eqref=cveq] it follows that, in this case,

[formula]

Substituting [\eqref=P] into [\eqref=veq] and using [\eqref=zrule] we find the following explicit formula for the coefficients in Eq. [\eqref=case3]

[formula]

Note that we have taken

[formula]

in order to eliminate a constant term in the potential. Comparing [\eqref=lame] with [\eqref=case3] we obtain the system

[formula]

which has the following four sets of solutions: The first two solutions are valid when ł is a non-negative integer ([formula] for the second solution to exist), while the last two solutions hold when ł is a positive half-integer. From the previous general discussion it follows that when ł is a non-negative integer or a positive half-integer a certain number of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Lamé Hamiltonian can be computed in a purely algebraic fashion, by solving the eigenvalue problem of the restriction of the operator H corresponding to the Hamiltonian [\eqref=lame] to the finite-dimensional space Pn, where n is given by [\eqref=alg1]-[\eqref=alg4]. An explicit expression for the gauge Hamiltonian H can be easily found from Eqs. [\eqref=HJ], [\eqref=PQR], [\eqref=P], and [\eqref=alg1]-[\eqref=alg4], namely

[formula]

Each of the four cases in this formula corresponds to the respective solution [\eqref=alg1]-[\eqref=alg4], and it is understood that in each case the operators [formula] ([formula]) and the constant c* must be computed using the value of n for the corresponding solution [\eqref=alg1]-[\eqref=alg4]. Note that Eq. [\eqref=hg14] is essentially equivalent to Eqs. (7)-(9) of Ref. [\cite=Tu89]. The latter equations, however, appear more complicated than [\eqref=hg14], due to the fact that Ref. [\cite=Tu89] uses the Weierstrassian form of Lamé's equation.

Before studying in more detail the four algebraizations [\eqref=alg1]-[\eqref=alg4] of the Lamé equation obtained in this section, it is worth pointing out that there are other alternative algebraizations within the general formalism described above. Indeed, from the identity

[formula]

and the fact that the potentials in Ref. [\cite=GKOqes94] are classified up to constant translations, it can be shown that the Lamé potential is a member of the first two families of periodic QES potentials listed in the latter reference. For the same reason, we could also have derived the Lamé equation by equating to zero the coefficients A, B and C in Eq. [\eqref=case3]. It can be shown that all these ways of algebraizing the Lamé equation are essentially equivalent to the one adopted in this paper. Finally, there are other less obvious algebraizations of the Lamé equation like, for instance, the non-standard one discussed in Ref. [\cite=UZ92], which falls into our framework by taking

[formula]

From Eq. [\eqref=PQR] it follows that in this case

[formula]

It is straightforward to show that the complex change of variable

[formula]

(cf. Eq. [\eqref=cveq]) and the gauge transformation defined by [\eqref=gauge] and [\eqref=geq] map H into the Schrödinger operator [\eqref=schr] with potential

[formula]

which is essentially the Lamé potential with ł = n / 2. Since P(z) is negative everywhere and all its roots are complex, it can be mapped to a negative multiple of the polynomial [\eqref=P] by a projective change of variable and gauge transformation. As explained in Ref. [\cite=GKOqes94], this means that the potential [\eqref=VUZ] can be obtained by a suitable choice of parameters in the third family of QES periodic potentials (with pure imaginary frequency [formula]).

Case I: ł is a non-negative integer

We shall show in this section that when ł is a non-negative integer the algebraic eigenfunctions of the Lamé Hamiltonian are the classical Lamé polynomials, [\cite=Ar64].

From Eqs. [\eqref=geq], [\eqref=zrule], and [\eqref=alg1]-[\eqref=alg2] we deduce that in this case the gauge factor verifies

[formula]

where we have dropped some irrelevant numerical factors. From Eqs. [\eqref=gauge], [\eqref=zrule], and [\eqref=gl], it follows that when ł is a non-negative integer then the Lamé Hamiltonian has ł + 1 eigenfunctions of the form

[formula]

where χ is a polynomial of degree at most ł. Thus we can write

[formula]

where [formula] is a homogeneous bivariate polynomial of degree ł. Similarly, if ł is strictly positive then there are ł additional eigenfunctions of the Lamé Hamiltonian of the form

[formula]

where [formula] is a homogeneous polynomial in two variables of degree ł - 1. Thus, when ł is a non-negative integer the Lamé Hamiltonian admits 2ł + 1 algebraic eigenfunctions of the form [\eqref=sol1]-[\eqref=sol2].

To show that the latter 2ł + 1 algebraic eigenfunctions are indeed the classical Lamé polynomials, we need to study in more detail Eqs. [\eqref=sol1]-[\eqref=sol2]. Fortunately, this can be done in a totally systematic way, by applying the general theory developed in Ref. [\cite=FGRorth96] for associating a (weakly) orthogonal polynomial family to a one-dimensional QES Hamiltonian. According to the prescription of the latter reference (cf. [\cite=FGRorth96], Eqs. (30), (33), and (35)), we must choose two different roots z1  ≠  z2 of P(z) such that

[formula]

Then the function

[formula]

(with [formula] and [formula] respectively given by Eqs. [\eqref=zrule] and [\eqref=gl]), is a formal solution of the Lamé equation with energy E if and only if the set [formula] satisfies a certain 3-term recurrence relation. If we normalize ψE so that P0 = 1, the latter recurrence relation implies that [formula] is a family of (weakly) orthogonal polynomials. Moreover, if the coefficients of the recurrence relation satisfy a positivity condition that we shall state and verify below, the critical polynomial Pn + 1 has n + 1 different real roots Ei, 0  ≤  i  ≤  n. Since it is easily shown that each of these roots is also a root of the polynomials Pj(E) with j > n + 1, for [formula] the function ψEi(x) is a genuine solution of the Lamé equation [\eqref=lame] with energy E = Ei. These n + 1 exact solutions can be obtained algebraically, by computing the n polynomials [formula] from the recurrence relation, and in fact coincide with the n + 1 eigenfunctions of the Lamé Hamiltonian H algebraically computable by diagonalizing the restriction of H to μPn (or, equivalently, the restriction of H to Pn).

It is immediate to verify that [\eqref=cond] is satisfied for both solutions [\eqref=alg1] and [\eqref=alg2] simply by taking z1 =  - i. If we choose z2  =  i, from Eq. [\eqref=psigen] we obtain the following expression (up to a constant factor) for the ł + 1 exact eigenfunctions of the Lamé Hamiltonian coming from the first algebraization [\eqref=alg1]

[formula]

where the ł + 1 energies Ei satisfy

[formula]

In the same way, the second algebraization [\eqref=alg2] yields the ł eigenfunctions

[formula]

where [formula] is the orthogonal polynomial family constructed from the solution [\eqref=alg2], and the ł energies Ẽi are given by

[formula]

We shall next derive the recurrence relation defining the polynomials Pj and P̃j. According to the general procedure described in Ref. [\cite=FGRorth96], the latter relation is determined by the coefficients of the auxiliary polynomials P̂(w), (w) obtained by applying to P(z) and Q(z) the projective transformation

[formula]

namely

[formula]

(with z1 =  - i =  - z2 in the present case). From Eqs. [\eqref=P] and [\eqref=phat] we easily obtain the following formula for P̂, valid for both algebraizations [\eqref=alg1] and [\eqref=alg2]

[formula]

Similarly, Eqs. [\eqref=PQR] and [\eqref=qhat] imply that the polynomial [formula] associated to the first algebraization [\eqref=alg1] is given by

[formula]

while for the second algebraization [\eqref=alg2] we obtain

[formula]

Following Ref. [\cite=FGRorth96], we define new polynomials P̂j(E) and  j(E) by

[formula]

It is shown in Ref. [\cite=FGRorth96] that the polynomials P̂j satisfy the recurrence relation

[formula]

with P̂- 1 = 0 and

[formula]

Likewise, the polynomials  j verify the recurrence relation

[formula]

where  - 1 = 0, and the coefficients ãj and j are given by

[formula]

Note that from the normalization P0  =  P̃0 = 1 and Eq. [\eqref=pphatint] it follows that

[formula]

Furthermore, Eqs. [\eqref=ajint] and [\eqref=taj] imply that the coefficients aj and ãj are strictly positive for 1  ≤  j  ≤  ł and 1  ≤  j  ≤  ł - 1, respectively. By Lemma 1 (Sec. 1.8) of Ref. [\cite=Ar64], this positivity condition guarantees that all the roots of the critical polynomials P̂ł + 1 and  ł are real and simple, as we had anticipated.

Our next task is to simplify Eqs. [\eqref=psiei1] and [\eqref=psiei2] using the properties of the polynomials Pj and P̃j. We shall start by proving the following useful result:

The algebraic eigenfunctions [\eqref=psiei1] and [\eqref=psiei2] are always either real or purely imaginary.

Let us rewrite Eqs. [\eqref=psiei1] and [\eqref=psiei2] in terms of the elliptic amplitude [formula], defined by

[formula]

We thus obtain the expressions

[formula]

where we have set, for convenience,

[formula]

Let us concentrate, for definiteness, on the eigenfunctions of type [\eqref=psiphi]. We rewrite Eq. [\eqref=psiphi] in the form

[formula]

where we take pi,ł / 2 = 0 when ł is odd. Taking into account that, by the recurrence relation [\eqref=rr]-[\eqref=bjint], all the coefficients pij are real, we conclude from the Eq. [\eqref=psi2] that

[formula]

Let us now introduce the polynomial family

[formula]

in terms of which the coefficients pij are simply expressed by

[formula]

Defining two additional families of univariate polynomials [formula] and ρj(E) by

[formula]

from Eqs. [\eqref=repsi]-[\eqref=impsi] we have

[formula]

(where

[formula]

(E)=(E) π(E) ,  j ,

[formula]

Let us order, from now on, the ł + 1 algebraic eigenvalues Ei of the Lamé equation in increasing order, i.e.,

[formula]

and similarly for the ł eigenvalues Ẽi. From Lemma 1 (Sec. 1.8) of Ref. [\cite=Ar64] and the positivity of aj for 1  ≤  j  ≤  ł we easily deduce that

[formula]

which implies (by Eq. [\eqref=pipoly]) that πł(Ei) has the sign of ( - 1)i. Thus for even i we have [formula], and from [\eqref=sd0] we conclude that ρ0(Ei) = 0. In the same way we establish that [formula] for odd i. From Eq. [\eqref=reim0] we obtain

[formula]

We can therefore write the ł + 1 exact eigenfunctions of type [\eqref=psiei1] of the Lamé equation as the Jacobi-Fourier series

[formula]

with

[formula]

and

[formula]

We can derive in a totally analogous way an equivalent formula for the ł eigenfunctions of type [\eqref=psi2], namely

[formula]

where now

[formula]

and

[formula]

Our next step is to further simplify Eqs. [\eqref=lame1e]-[\eqref=rangers2] for the algebraic eigenfunctions of the Lamé Hamiltonian. To this end, recall that by construction the Chebyshev polynomials Tj and Uj ([formula]) satisfy the identities

[formula]

where the latter equality is formally valid for j = 0 if we set U- 1 = 0. It follows that

[formula]

It is now straightforward to check that Eqs. [\eqref=phi2r]-[\eqref=phit2r+1] encompass the eight types of classical Lamé polynomials listed in Ref. [\cite=Ar64]. Indeed, note first of all that the polynomials Tj(t) and Uj(t) have the parity of ( - 1)j under the reflection x  ↦   - x. Therefore the formulas

[formula]

define even polynomials T̃2j(t) and Ũ2j(t) of degree 2j. If ł = 2N ([formula]), Eqs. [\eqref=phi2r]-[\eqref=phit2r+1] yield the following four types of polynomial -- in [formula], [formula], [formula] -- solutions of the Lamé equation:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and αr(t), βs(t), α̃s(t), and s(t) are polynomials of respective degrees

[formula]

Similarly, if ł = 2N + 1 ([formula]) the exact solutions of the Lamé equation [\eqref=phi2r]-[\eqref=phit2r+1] can be written as follows:

[formula]

where the range of the indices r,s is still given by Eq. [\eqref=range], and γr(t), δr(t), γ̃r(t), and s(t) are polynomials with

[formula]

Examples

The explicit expressions for the Lamé polynomials in terms of Chebyshev polynomials derived at the end of the previous section can be used to algorithmically compute the Lamé polynomials and their corresponding energies for low values of ł.

When ł = 1, Eqs. [\eqref=ph2r2N+1]-[\eqref=tph2s+12N+1] for N = 0 immediately yield the following well-known formulas for the Lamé polynomials of order 1:

[formula]

The critical polynomials P̂2 and  1 are easily computed using the recurrence relations [\eqref=rr]-[\eqref=tbj], with the result

[formula]

The energies associated to the eigenfunctions [\eqref=l=1] are just the roots of each of the latter polynomials ordered increasingly, namely

[formula]

For ł = 2 the critical polynomials are

[formula]

The energies corresponding to the Lamé polynomials of order two are therefore given by Note that the factor of 2 in [\eqref=El=2] is missing in Ref. [\cite=Ar64], p. 205. The Lamé polynomials are easily computed using [\eqref=ph2r2N]-[\eqref=tph2s+12N] with N = 1, with the following result:

When ł = 3 the critical polynomials are given by

[formula]

from which the following exact energies are computed:

[formula]

From Eqs. [\eqref=ph2r2N+1]-[\eqref=tph2s+12N+1] with N = 1, the corresponding Lamé polynomials are given by

[formula]

The latter formulas for the Lamé polynomials of order three and their corresponding energies are seen to coincide with those given in Ref. [\cite=Ar64].

When ł is greater than three, it becomes increasingly more difficult to compute the Lamé polynomials of order ł and their corresponding eigenfunctions in closed form. This is essentially due to the fact that the high degree of the critical polynomials P̂ł and  ł + 1 in general makes it impossible to exactly compute the energies Ei and Ẽi, which enter in the definition of the coefficients pij and p̃ij. For example, for ł = 4 the critical polynomials P̂5 and  4 are given by

[formula]

It is not difficult to verify that the roots of the quadratic factor of P5 are the energies E1 and E3, so that we have the exact formula

[formula]

The corresponding Lamé polynomials are easily computed using Eq. [\eqref=ph2s+12N]:

[formula]

Similarly, the fact that P̃4 factorizes into two quadratic polynomials allows us to exactly compute the energies Ẽi in this case, obtaining

[formula]

By Eqs. [\eqref=tph2s2N]-[\eqref=tph2s+12N], the corresponding eigenfunctions are given by

[formula]

The remaining Lamé polynomials of order four can be expressed using Eq. [\eqref=ph2r2N] in terms of the three roots Ei (i = 0,2,4) of the cubic factor of P̂5, with the following result:

[formula]

For instance, for m = 1 / 2 the roots E0, E2 and E4 can be computed in closed form:

[formula]

Substituting into Eq. [\eqref=ph024l4] we obtain the following exact expressions for the corresponding Lamé polynomials for m = 1 / 2:

Case II: ł is a positive half-integer

This is the most interesting case, since we shall see that it leads to the non-meromorphic Lamé functions, whose algebraization has proved more difficult than that of the Lamé polynomials.

The gauge factor can be computed from Eqs. [\eqref=geq], [\eqref=zrule], and [\eqref=alg3]-[\eqref=alg4], with the result

[formula]

The upper and lower signs in this formula correspond, respectively, to the solutions [\eqref=alg3] and [\eqref=alg4],

[formula]

and we are using the customary notation

[formula]

Thus when ł is a positive half-integer the Lamé equation has 2n + 2 = 2ł + 1 algebraic solutions of the form

[formula]

where χ± is a polynomial of degree at most n.

We shall now use the same strategy as in the previous section to simplify the eigenfunctions [\eqref=sol34]. It is straightforward to check that in this case only the two roots ±  i / k' of the polynomial P(z) in [\eqref=P] satisfy [\eqref=cond]. For reasons that shall become clear later, we shall choose

[formula]

where again the upper sign corresponds to [\eqref=alg3] and the lower sign to [\eqref=alg4]. Using the same convention for the eigenfunctions ψ±E±i and the polynomials P±j, a straightforward calculation yields

[formula]

We have dropped an inessential constant factor in the latter formula, and the energies E±i are defined by

[formula]

(We shall prove below that the roots of P±n + 1 are indeed real and simple.)

We now compute the polynomials P±j, or more precisely the recurrence relation defining them. In principle, we should use the notation P̂±(w) and ±(w) to denote the polynomials P̂(w), (w) in Eqs. [\eqref=phat]-[\eqref=qhat] corresponding to each of the two cases [\eqref=alg3] and [\eqref=alg4]. Remarkably, a direct calculation shows that this is actually unnecessary, since

[formula]

This implies that the recurrence relations determining the two sets of orthogonal polynomials [formula] are in fact the same. Since we have normalized both sets so that P±0(E) = 1, it follows that both polynomial families are identical, namely

[formula]

In particular, the above equality for j = n + 1 and Eq. [\eqref=epm] show that

[formula]

Moreover, to each of these n + 1 energies correspond two algebraic eigenfunctions of the form [\eqref=eigenf], which on account of [\eqref=Ppmeq] can be written as

[formula]

From Eqs. [\eqref=phat2]-[\eqref=qhat2] we see that the coefficients of the polynomials P̂(w) and (w) are all real. This implies, [\cite=FGRorth96], that the coefficients of the recurrence relation determining the polynomials Pj(E) are also real. Since P0(E) = 1, it follows that Pj(E) is a polynomial with real coefficients, for all [formula]. From Eq. [\eqref=psipmei] and the positivity of the coefficient aj for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n (cf. Eq. [\eqref=aj] below), it follows that all the energies Ei (0  ≤  i  ≤  n) are real and simple, and therefore

[formula]

where the overbar denotes complex conjugation. If we set

[formula]

then for each root Ei of Pn + 1 the Lamé equation has two algebraic real-valued solutions given by

[formula]

The recurrence relation satisfied by the polynomials Pj(E) can be easily written down from [\eqref=phat2]-[\eqref=qhat2] using the prescription of Ref. [\cite=FGRorth96]. Indeed, if, following the latter reference, we write

[formula]

then the polynomials P̂j satisfy a three-term recurrence relation of the form [\eqref=rr], with

[formula]

We are ready to show that, when ł is a half-integer, the 2ł + 1 algebraic solutions of the Lamé equation of the form [\eqref=realsol]-[\eqref=psipmei] obtained in the previous section are precisely the non-meromorphic Lamé functions.

To this end, we need to simplify Eq. [\eqref=psipmei]. In the first place, since

[formula]

(recall that [formula] is positive for all real x), we can write

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Secondly, we have

[formula]

where we have set

[formula]

Note that the functions [formula] and [formula] are C∞ on the whole real line except at the points x = 2(2r + 1)  K. We shall also find useful in the sequel the identities

[formula]

From [\eqref=cnsn] it follows that

[formula]

where the coefficients pij are again defined by Eq. [\eqref=pptij]. The sum in the latter equation is of the same time as [\eqref=psiphi], and therefore can be expressed as follows:

[formula]

where we have used the customary abbreviations

[formula]

and we have again set

[formula]

From Eqs. [\eqref=sqrt] and [\eqref=sqrtid] (dropping the constant factor [formula]) we easily obtain

[formula]

An analogous calculation leads to the following expression for the second solution φ2i(x):

[formula]

Let us now study in more detail the properties of the 2ł + 1 solutions of the Lamé equation of the form [\eqref=ph1]-[\eqref=ph2] that we have just obtained. From the differentiability properties of the functions [formula] and [formula] mentioned above, it follows that φ1i(x) and φ2i(x) are C∞ solutions of the Lamé equation [\eqref=lame] with E = Ei in the open interval ( - 2K,2K), and are clearly continuous on

[formula]

anti-periodically, i.e. requiring that

[formula]

then f becomes a C∞ function. (Indeed, in a neighborhood of ±  2K the prolongations of [formula] and [formula] are equal, respectively, to [formula] and [formula], the latter functions being obviously C∞ at [formula].) It follows that, if we define φ1i(x) and φ2i(x) outside

[formula]

(x+2K)=- x ,  (x+2K)=- x ,  (x+2K)= x ,

[formula]

Examples

The case n = 0, i.e, ł = 1 / 2, is particularly easy to deal with in the framework of our formalism. Indeed, in this case we can exactly compute one eigenvalue E0 of the Lamé Hamiltonian, its corresponding two linearly independent eigenfunctions given by [\eqref=ph1eince]-[\eqref=ph2eince] with n = 0:

[formula]

The eigenvalue E0 is the root of the first degree polynomial P1 or, equivalently, of P̂1 (since both polynomials differ by a constant factor, by [\eqref=pphat]). From Eq. [\eqref=rr] with j = 0 we get

[formula]

and from [\eqref=bj] (with n = 0) it follows that

[formula]

We have thus shown in a purely algebraic fashion that the general solution of the Lamé equation

[formula]

is a linear combination of the two functions [\eqref=zeroef].

Similarly, for n = 1, i.e, ł = 3 / 2, the two algebraic eigenvalues of the Lamé Hamiltonian are the roots of the polynomial

[formula]

namely,

[formula]

Their associated eigenfunctions are easily computed using Eqs. [\eqref=phi1ince]-[\eqref=bi], which for n = 1 reduce to

[formula]

From Eq. [\eqref=phi1ince] we obtain

[formula]

where we have omitted a trivial constant factor. The remaining two eigenfunctions [formula] and [formula] can be easily obtained from [\eqref=eigfn1] using [\eqref=phi2ince]:

[formula]

The latter formulas are easily seen to coincide with the ones at the end of Ref. [\cite=In39].

As in the case of integer ł, the computation of the non-meromorphic Lamé functions in closed form quickly becomes unmanageable as the degree of the critical polynomial P̂n + 1 increases. For example, for ł = 5 / 2 (i.e., n = 2) the algebraic eigenfunctions of the form [\eqref=ph1even] can be expressed as follows

[formula]

where Ei is one of the three real roots of the critical polynomial

[formula]

The remaining three eigenfunctions [formula] (i = 0,1,2) are obtained from the Eq. [\eqref=phi5/2] using Eq. [\eqref=ph2eince]. When m = 1 / 2, the energies Ei can again be computed explicitly, i.e.,

[formula]

Consequently, Eq. [\eqref=phi5/2] for the eigenfunctions yields the following explicit expressions:
