A note on the q-derivative operator

Usually the q-derivative operator Dq is defined by

[formula]

where q is fixed and 0 < q < 1. However, this definition is not valid for x = 0. On the other hand, the hypothesis 0 < q < 1 can be weakened. So we define

[formula]

for functions f which are differentiable at x = 0, where q is a fixed real number not equal to 1.

Note that the existence of f'(0) implies that the domain of f contains the point zero in its interior.

Further we define [formula] for [formula], where D0q denotes the identity operator.

In this paper we prove the following theorem.

Theorem. Let n be a positive integer and let f be a function for which f(n)(0) exists. Then we have

[formula]

The real variable case.

Let f be a function of a real variable x and let the domain of f contain the interval ( - ρ,ρ) for some ρ > 0.

We use the following version of l'Hospital's rule (see for instance section 84 in [\cite=Frank]) :

Let F and G be functions whose nth (n  ≥  1) derivatives at x = 0 exist. Suppose that

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

First of all we take q = 0. Then we have

[formula]

and [formula]. Further we have

[formula]

Now we will show that

[formula]

and

[formula]

for each [formula] for which f(n)(0) exists.

We use induction on n. For n = 1 we have ([\ref=3']) and ([\ref=5']) by definition. So we assume that f(n + 1)(0) exists and that ([\ref=3']) and ([\ref=5']) are valid for some [formula]. Then we find

[formula]

Further we have by using ([\ref=A]) and l'Hospital's rule above

[formula]

This proves ([\ref=3']) and ([\ref=5']) for each [formula] for which f(n)(0) exists.

Now a combination of ([\ref=A]) and ([\ref=5']) completes the proof of the theorem if q = 0.

For q =  - 1 the definition ([\ref=def]) leads to

[formula]

and [formula]. So we have by using l'Hospital's rule

[formula]

if f'(0) exists. This proves the theorem for n = 1.

Further we have

[formula]

And by using l'Hospital's rule we obtain

[formula]

if f''(0) exists. This implies that

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

So we have for n  ≥  2 : if f(n)(0) exists, then f''(0) exists and Dn- 1f(x) = 0 for |x| < ρ. This proves the theorem for q =  - 1.

In the sequel we assume that q  ≠  0 and q  ≠   - 1.

We show first that for every positive integer n

[formula]

if f(n)(0) exists.

The definition ([\ref=def]) of the q-derivative operator Dq leads to

[formula]

If we multiply by (1 - q)x and replace f by Dqf we obtain

[formula]

Now we use induction on n to see that we have for [formula] :

[formula]

where the q-binomial coefficient [formula] is defined by

[formula]

Let n be a positive integer and assume that f(n)(0) exists.

Now we define

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Now we use (see for instance [\cite=GasRah])

[formula]

for q real with |q|  ≠  1 and a an arbitrary complex number, to obtain

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

So we have

[formula]

Applying l'Hospital's rule above we obtain

[formula]

This proves ([\ref=first]).

Now we prove that for every positive integer n

[formula]

if f(n)(0) exists.

We use induction on n.

For n = 1 we have ([\ref=second]) by definition.

Assume that f(n + 1)(0) exists and ([\ref=second]) holds for some [formula]. Now we use the definition ([\ref=def]) and ([\ref=dqn]) to find

[formula]

Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then we have by using ([\ref=sumdelta])

[formula]

and

[formula]

So we have by using l'Hospital's rule again

[formula]

This proves ([\ref=second]) for every [formula] for which f(n)(0) exists.

The complex variable case.

Now let f be a function of a complex variable z.

If f'(0) exists, then we have by definition [formula]. Further we have for q  ≠  0

[formula]

For q = 0 we simply obtain

[formula]

If f''(0) exists, then f' exists in a neighbourhood of z = 0 which means that f is analytic in a neighbourhood of z = 0. This implies that f(m)(0) exists for [formula] and we have

[formula]

Applying the definition ([\ref=def]) we find

[formula]

where [formula] should be replaced by ρ in the case that q = 0.

Hence Dqf(z) is analytic in a neighbourhood of z = 0. Now we use induction to find for [formula]

[formula]

where [formula] should be replaced by ρ if q = 0.

Hence Dnqf(z) is analytic in a neighbourhood of z = 0. So we easily obtain

[formula]

This completes the proof of the theorem in the complex variable case.

Remark 1. Since we defined the q-derivative operator for functions f which are only assumed to be differentiable at x = 0, the well-known limit

[formula]

no longer holds in general, but only for those x where f is differentiable.

Remark 2. In the complex variable case the definition ([\ref=def]) can be extended to complex values of q and then the theorem still holds for complex values of q  ≠  1.
