Transport Properties in (Na,Ca)Co2O4 Ceramics

8truept4truept*Abstract The resistivity and thermopower of polycrystalline Na1.1 - xCaxCo2O4 were measured and analyzed. Both the quantities increase with x, suggesting that the carrier density is decreased by the substitutions of Ca2 + for Na+. Considering that the temperature dependence of the resistivity show a characteristic change with x, the conduction mechanism is unlikely to come from a simple electron-phonon scattering. As a reference for NaCo2O4, single crystals of a two-dimensional Co oxide Bi2 - xPbxM3Co2O9 (M = Sr and Ba) were studied. The Pb substitution decreases the resistivity, leaving the thermopower nearly intact.

8truept4truept A search for new thermoelectric (TE) materials is an old problem that has been reexamined to date [\cite=Mahan]. Even though binary compounds might have been thoroughly studied, a thermoelectric material of higher performance might sleep in ternary, quaternary or more complicated compounds. A filled skutterudite is an example for newly discovered TE materials [\cite=Sales].

Very recently Terasaki, Sasago and Uchinokura have found that a layered Co oxide NaCo2O4, whose crystal structure is schematically drawn in Fig. 1, shows large thermopower (100 μV/K at 300 K) and low resistivity (200 μΩcm at 300 K) along the a axis [\cite=Tera]. A striking feature of this compound is that the thermopower of 100 μV/K is realized in the carrier density of 1021 cm- 3. This is difficult to explain in the framework of the conventional band picture, and there should exist a mechanism to enhance the thermopower.

In conventional TE materials, the TE performance is optimized near a carrier density of 1019 cm- 3. Thus we expect that the TE performance of NaCo2O4 may be improved by the reduction of the carrier density. The easiest way to change the carrier density is to substitute a divalent cation such as Ca2 + for a monovalent Na+. Motivated by this, we measured and analyzed the resistivity and thermopower of polycrystalline (Na,Ca)Co2O4. Another way is to study a two-dimensional Co oxide with low carrier density. For this purpose Bi2Sr3Co2O9 (The crystal structure is shown in Fig. 2) is most suitable, because the resistivity is lowered by the Ba-substitution for Sr [\cite=Tara] and the Pb substitution for Bi [\cite=Tsuka]. In addition, the optical reflectivity shows a small Drude weight [\cite=Tera2]. We report on its transport properties in the latter part of the proceedings.

8truept4truept Polycrystalline samples of Na1.1 - xCaxCo2O4 were prepared in a conventional solid-state reaction [\cite=Yakabe]. An appropriate mixture of powdered NaCO3, CaCO3 and Co3O4 was calcined at 860[formula]C for 12 h. The product was finely ground, pressed into a pellet, and sintered at 800[formula]C for 6 h. The x-ray diffraction pattern showed no trace of impurities. Note that the a tiny trace of impurity phases was detected in the product from stoichiometric mixture (Na:Co=1:2), which indicates the evaporation of a small amount of Na. Thus we added excess Na of 10 at.% to prepare NaCo2O4.

Single crystals of Bi2M3Co2O9 (M=Sr and Ba) [\cite=Tara] and Bi2 - xPbxSr3Co2O9 [\cite=Tsuka] were prepared by a self-flux technique. Crystals were platelike with typical dimensions of 1×  1×  0.01 mm3. As for the Pb substitution, we prepared two different crystals with nominal compositions of x=0.2 and 0.4.

Resistivity (ρ) was measured through a four-probe method. Thermopower (S) was measured with a nano-voltmeter (HP 34420A), where a typical resolution was 5-10 nV. Two edges of a sample was pasted on Cu sheets working as a heat bath, and the temperature gradient of 0.5-1 K was measured through a differential thermocouple made of copper-constantan. The contributions from copper leads were carefully subtracted.

8truept4truept Let us begin with the effect of excess Na on the resistivity of Na1.1 + xCo2O4. Na is an element difficult to control. First, it is quite volatile above 800[formula]C. Secondly, residual Na is rarely observed in x-ray diffraction patterns, because it often exists as deliquesced NaOH in the grain boundary. Moreover the Na site in NaCo2O4 is 50% vacant, that is, the Na content x can change from 0 to 1. Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of ρ of polycrystalline Na1.1 + xCo2O4. We attributed the increase of ρ with x to the excess Na in the grain boundaries, and regarded the sample for x = 0 as the parent material for Ca substitution.

Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show ρ and S of polycrystalline samples of Na1.1 - xCaxCo2O4. The magnitudes of ρ and S increase with x, suggesting that the carrier density is reduced by the Ca substitution. This is naturally understood from a viewpoint of Co valence. In NaCo2O4 the formal valence (p) of Co is 3.5 + , i.e., Co3 +:Co4 +=1:1. The Ca substitution decreases p down to 3 + , which corresponds to the configuration of (3d)6. Since the six electrons fully occupied the three dγ bands in the low spin state, oxides with Co3 + are often insulating. As expected, the power factor S2  /  ρ is improved in x  ~  0.15 by 20%. It should be emphasized that the Ca substitution changes the temperature dependence of ρ. For example, while ρ for x=0 shows a positive curvature below 100 K, ρ for x=0.35 shows a negative curvature. This indicates that the scattering rate depends strongly on the carrier density, which is unlikely to arise from the electron-phonon scattering.

Next we discuss the thermoeletric properties of (Bi, Pb)2M3Co2O9. In Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), ρ and S of Bi2M3Co2O9 single crystals along the in-plane direction are plotted as a function of temperature. ρ of the present samples reproduces the data in the literature, where the electric conduction for M=Ba is more metallic than that for M=Ba [\cite=Tara]. Note that the magnitude of S is above 100 μV/K for both samples, owing to the small carrier density.

In contrast to the Ba substitution for Sr, Pb not only works as an acceptor, but also modifies the electronic states of Bi2Sr3Co2O9. Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show ρ and S of Bi2 - xPbxSr3Co2O9 single crystals along the in-plane direction. ρ is decreased drastically by the Pb substitution, which looks similar to Fig. 5(a). However, S remains nearly unchanged upon the Pb substitution, which clearly indicates that the Ba and Pb substitutions affect the electronic states differently. The anomalous electronic states of Bi2 - xPbxSr3Co2O9 are also suggested by the large negative magnetoresistance at low temperatures [\cite=Tsuka].

8truept4truept In summary, we prepared polycrystalline samples of Na1.1 - xCaxCo2O4 and single-crystal samples of Bi2 - xPbxM3Co2O9 (M= Sr and Ba; x=0, 0.2 and 0.4). In Na1.1 - xCaxCo2O4, both the resistivity and the thermopower increase with x, which suggests that the carrier density is decreased by the Ca substitution. In Bi2 - xPbxM3Co2O9, the resistivity is decreased by the Ba and Pb substitutions, but the doping effects on the thermopower are different. While the Ba substitution decreases the thermopower, the Pb substitution hardly changes the thermopower. This is a direct example that the resistivity can be lowered while the thermopower is kept large.
