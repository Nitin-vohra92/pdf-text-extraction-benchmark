Universal Metric Spaces and Extension Dimension

The existence of universal separable metric spaces for extension dimension with respect to countable CW-complexes was proved by Olszewski in [\cite=wo:95]. In the class of all metric spaces of a given weight this problem was recently solved by Levin [\cite=l:98]. In the present note we show the existence of universal metric spaces having some extra properties (see Theorem 1 below). The concept of extension dimension was introduced by Dranishnikov [\cite=d:94] (see also [\cite=ch1:97], [\cite=dd:96]). For a normal space X and a CW-complex K we write [formula] (the extension dimension of X does not exceed K) if K is an absolute extensor for X. This means that any continuous map f:A  →  K, defined on a closed subset A of X, admits a continuous extension :X  →  K. Since not every CW-complex is an absolute neighborhood extensor for normal spaces, we can enlarge the class of normal spaces X with [formula] (K is a CW-complex) by introducing the following notion (see [\cite=lr:91]): A normal space X is in the class α(K) if every continuous map from a closed A  ⊂  X to K which extends to a map of a neighborhood of A to K can be extended to a map of X to K. Obviously, if K∈ANE(X) (this, for example, holds for every X admitting a perfect map onto a first countable paracompact space [\cite=jd:95]) then X∈α(K) if and only if [formula]. We also adopt the following definition: a continuous map f:X  →  Y is called K-soft (resp., K-soft with respect to metrizable spaces) if for any normal (resp., metrizable) space Z with Z∈α(K), any closed Z0  ⊂  Z, and any two maps g:Z0  →  X, h:Z  →  Y with [formula], there exists a map k:Z  →  X such that [formula] and k|Z0 = g.

For any CW-complex K and any cardinal number τ  ≥  ω let M(K,τ) be the class of all completely metrizable spaces X of weight τ with [formula]. The following theorem is our main result:

For any countable CW-complex K and a cardinal number τ  ≥  ω there exists a completely metrizable space X(K,τ) and a K-soft map f(K,τ):X(K,τ)  →  l2(τ) satisfying the following properties:

For the case K = Sn, [formula], Theorem 1 was proved in [\cite=cv:90]. Our proof of Theorem 1 is based on the next few lemmas and the techniques developed in [\cite=ch2:89] and [\cite=cv:90].

For any countable CW-complex K and any separable (completely) metrizable space X there exists a separable (completely) metrizable space YX with [formula] and a K-soft map f:YX  →  X.

Let P be a Polish ANR homotopically equivalent to K and φ:X  →  P and ψ:P  →  X be two maps such that [formula] is homotopic to idP and ψφ is homotopic to idK. For extension dimension with respect to P this lemma was proved in [\cite=ch1:97]. So, for a given (complete) separable metric space X there is a (complete) separable metric space YX with [formula] and a P-soft map f:YX  →  X. According to next claim, f is K-soft.

Claim. If Z∈α(K) is normal, then Z∈α(P)

Suppose Z∈α(K) is a normal space. Since every Polish ANR is an ANE for normal spaces, Z∈α(P) is equivalent to P∈Æ(Z). Take a map g:A  →  P, where A  ⊂  Z is closed and consider the map [formula]. Because g can be extended to a map from a neighborhood U of A into P, [formula] can be extended to a map from U to K. Since Z∈α(K), there is an extension h:Z  →  K of [formula]. Then the restriction (φh)|A is homotopic to g. Finally, using that the Homotopy Extension Theorem holds for normal spaces and Polish ANR's, we conclude that g is extendable to a map from Z into P. Hence Z∈α(P).

It remains only to show that [formula]. And this follows from [formula] and the fact that the Homotopy Extension Theorem holds for metric spaces and CW-complexes [\cite=jd:95].

[\cite=l:98] Let f:X  →  Y be a uniformly 0-dimensional map of metrizable spaces X and Y. Then [formula].

Recall that a map f:X  →  Y, where X and Y are metrizable spaces, is called uniformly 0-dimensional [\cite=k:52] if there exists a compatible metric on X such that for every ε > 0 and every y∈f(X) there is an open neighborhood U of y such that f- 1(U) can be represented as the union of disjoint open sets of diam  <  ε. It is well known that every metric space admits a uniformly 0-dimensional map into Hilbert cube Q.

For any countable CW-complex K and a (completely) metrizable space Y of weight τ there exist a (completely) metrizable space X of weight τ and a K-soft map f:X  →  Y such that [formula].

It suffices to prove this corollary when Y is the space l2(τ). Fix a compatible metric d1 on l2(τ) and an uniformly 0-dimensional surjection (with respect to d1) g:l2(τ)  →  A with A a separable metric space. By Lemma [\ref=L:1], there exists a separable metric space Z with [formula] and a K-soft map h:Z  →  A. Let X be the fibered product of l2(τ) and Z with respect to g and h, and let f:X  →  l2(τ) and p:X  →  Z denote the corresponding projections of this fibered product. If d2 is any metric on Z, then p is uniformly 0-dimensional with respect to the metric [formula] (see [\cite=ap:73]). Hence, by Lemma [\ref=L:2], [formula]. The K-softness of h implies that f is also K-soft.

It remains only to show that X is completely metrizable. To this end let BX be the space obtained from βX by making the points of βX - X isolated. According to [\cite=p:78], BX is paracompact, and obviously, BX is first countable.

Claim. [formula]

Let s:F  →  K be an arbitrary map, where F  ⊂  BX is closed. Since [formula], there exists an extension [formula] of s. Now we need the following result [\cite=jd:95]: any contractible CW-complex is an absolute extensor for all spaces admitting a perfect map onto a first countable paracompact space. This statement implies that [formula] is an absolute extensor for BX. Therefore, there exists an extension [formula] of s1. Let [formula], where [formula]. Fix a retraction [formula]. Since H is clopen in BX, it follows that [formula] can be extended to a map s3:BX  →  K. Then s3 is an extension of s and, consequently, [formula].

Now let us go back to the proof of the completeness of X. Considering X as a closed subset of BX and using the fact that l2(τ) is an absolute extensor for paracompact spaces, we can find a map q:BX  →  l2(τ) such that q|X = f. Then, since f is K-soft and [formula], there exists a retraction from BX onto X. Finally, applying the argument from [\cite=p:78], we conclude that X is complete.

Proof of Theorem 1. We will construct an inverse sequence [formula] such that:

X1 = l2(τ) and Xn∈M(K,τ) for each n  ≥  1;

each pn + 1n:Xn + 1  →  Xn is a K-soft map such that for any completely metrizable space Z of weight ≤  τ with [formula] and any map g:Z  →  Xn there exists a closed embedding h:Z  →  Xn + 1 with [formula].

If Xi and pii - 1 have already been constructed for [formula], then, by Lemma [\ref=L:3], there exist a completely metrizable space Xn + 1 of weight τ and a K-soft map hn + 1:Xn + 1  →  Xn  ×  l2(τ) such that [formula]. Let [formula], where πn:Xn  ×  l2(τ)  →  Xn is the natural projection. Denote by X(K,τ) the limit space of S and by f(K,τ) the limit projection p1:X(K,τ)  →  X1. Obviously, X(K,τ) is a completely metrizable space of weight τ and f(K,τ) is K-soft. Following the proof of Lemma 2.6 from [\cite=cv:90] one can show that f(K,τ) is strongly (K,τ)-universal. Finally, by the limit theorem of Rubin-Schapiro [\cite=rs:98], [formula]. Observe that X(K,τ) is an absolute extensor for all normal spaces Y with [formula] because l2(τ) is an absolute extensor for normal spaces and f(K,τ) is K-soft.

We can apply Theorem 1 to obtain universal spaces for all metrizable spaces with a given cohomological dimension and a given weight. Recall that, for any abelian group G and a natural number n, the cohomological dimension dim GX of X with a coefficient group G is ≤  n iff [formula], where X is a normal space and K(G,n) is the Eilenberg-MacLane complex. Let us agree the following notations: a map f is called (G,n)-soft iff it is K(G,n)-soft, and f is strongly (G,n,τ)-universal iff f is strongly (K(G,n),τ)-universal.

Let G be a countable (resp., torsion) abelian group. Then for every [formula] and τ  ≥  ω there exists a completely metrizable space Xτ(G,n) of weight τ and a map fτ(G,n):Xτ(G,n)  →  l2(τ) such that:

If G is countable, the proof follows directly from Theorem 1 with K = K(G,n). If G is torsion, by [\cite=jd:93], there exists a countable family σ(G) of countable groups such that [formula] for any metrizable space Y. Then, according to [\cite=jd:96], for each [formula] there is a countable complex Kn with [formula] if and only if [formula], Y is any metrizable space. Finally, apply Theorem 1 to Kn.

Similarly, using Theorem 1 and [\cite=jd:93]), we can obtain the following

Let G be an arbitrary abelian group. Then for every [formula] and τ  ≥  ω there exists a completely metrizable space Yτ(G,n) of weight τ and a map gτ(G,n):Yτ(G,n)  →  l2(τ) such that:

For τ  =  ω weaker versions of Corollary [\ref=Cor:1] and Corollary [\ref=Cor:2] were proved in [\cite=wo:95].
