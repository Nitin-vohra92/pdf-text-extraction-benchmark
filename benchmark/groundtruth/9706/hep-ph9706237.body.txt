Model Building Paul H. Frampton

Abstract

In this talk I begin with some general discussion of model building in particle theory, emphasizing the need for motivation and testability.

Three illustrative examples are then described. The first is the Left-Right model which provides an explanation for the chirality of quarks and leptons. The second is the 331-model which offers a first step to understanding the three generations of quarks and leptons. Third and last is the SU(15) model which can accommodate the light leptoquarks possibly seen at HERA.

Introduction

The Standard Model(SM) successfully fits all reproducible experimental data. The model was built in the 1960s by Glashow[\cite=glashow], Salam[\cite=salam] and Weinberg[\cite=weinberg]. It was shown to be renormalizable in 1971 by 't Hooft[\cite=hooft]. Its experimental verification was in excellent shape by 1978 at the Tokyo Rochester Conference[\cite=tokyo]. The W±,Z0 were discovered in 1983[\cite=rubbia]. From 1983 to now there have been various ambulances to chase, where the data departed from the SM but further data always rescued the SM. The question is what to expect as new physics?

Fields

The SM has its own shortcomings and incompleteness which motivate model-building beyond it. A good starting point is to examine the large number of fields necessary in the SM.

Gauge Fields

The gauge sector is based on the group SU(3)C  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y. There are 12 gauge bosons each with two helicity states (we count fields before symmetry breaking) totalling 24.

Fermion Fields

Each of the three generations of quarks and leptons has 15 helicity states. For the first family there are:

[formula]

and similarly in the second and third families:

[formula]

[formula]

Scalar Fields

The minimal scalar sector is one complex doublet of Higgs fields:

[formula]

with 4 real fields. The total number of fields is thus 24 + 45 + 4  =  73. In perturbation theory B and L are conserved separately and, by definition, the neutrino masses vanish: m(νi)  =  0.

Parameters of the SM

There are other fundamental questions to bear in mind:

Why three families?

Why SU(3)  ×  SU(2)  ×  U(1)?

Why these fermion representations?

Elementarity of the Higgs?

Model Building

To build models beyond the standard model is at the same time:

completely trivial from the point of view of a mathematical physicist - the rules for building renormalizable gauge field theories have been known since 1971.

impossibly difficult in the absence of experimental data departing from the SM - how can one discriminate between models?

Quality of Model Building

There are three conditions to judge models by:

Motivation

The model should explain, shed light on, an otherwise unexplained aspect of the SM.

Testability

At accessible energies either new particles, or rare decays, should be predicted to depart clearly from the SM.

Aesthetics and Economy

Recall Dirac (1928) and his prediction of anti-matter. Some physicists, unimpressed by its beauty, might have discarded the Dirac equation as fatally-flawed due to its negative-energy solutions.

Supersymmetry

The most popular model beyond the Standard Model is unquestionably supersymmetry. Its motivation is to ameliorate, not solve, the gauge hierarchy problem. It is clearly testable by the prediction of a large number of sparticles below 1TeV.

The models I shall describe have their own motivation and testability outside of supersymmetry. This may seem old-fashioned but it is easier. After all, any renormalizable gauge theory can easily be promoted to a globally supersymmetric model, but the motivation to do so arises from the mathematical physics end of the spectrum not from the physics end.

It does seem, on aesthetic grounds, that supersymmetry is likely to be used by Nature in Her fundamental theory. The question is at what scale supersymmetry is broken. It may well be at the Planck scale so that supergravity and superstrings are fine; as for the supersymmetrized SM, I would prefer to profess ignorance of physics above a few PeV, and keep an open mind.

Enough proselytising! It is time to look at explicit examples.

Left-Right Model

The motivation is to understand P violation and secondly to clarify the role of the (B-L) quantum number.

Testability arises from the expectation of non-zero neutrino mass m(νi)  ≠  0. Also predicted are ΔB  =  2 processes like NN  →  pions and ΔL  =  2 processes like neutrinoless double beta decay: (ββ)0ν.

Assume[\cite=PS] [\cite=MP] [\cite=SM] the fundamental theory is P invariant. Promote the usual electroweak gauge group:

[formula]

to:

[formula]

The standard relationship:

[formula]

is replaced by:

[formula]

This is seen by

[formula]

Similarly for leptons

[formula]

So we now gauge the pre-existing quantity (B - L) rather than the more arbitrary Y.

The symmetry is broken:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

It is often assumed that MP  =  MWR. For MP  >  μ  >  MWR, g2L  ≠  g2R but WR and WL remain massless.

A minimal Higgs sector contains scalars:

[formula]

For a range of parameters this gives a P violating global minimum.

For phenomenology, precision tests of the SM require that M(WR),M(ZR)  ≥  500GeV. Such lower bounds come from analyses of p  →  μ+μ-  +  X, μ-  →  e-νμ, etc.

Since (V - A) theory was initially prompted by m(ν)  =  0 and γ5 invariance, the presence of (V + A) is naturally linked to m(ν)  ≠  0 by see-saw formulae like:

[formula]

The right-handed neutrino N is necessary in the left-right model, just as in the SO(10) GUT.

It is natural to expect ΔL  ≠  0 Majorana mass and (ββ)0ν proportional to mν.

From Eq.([\ref=Q]), and using ΔQ = 0 while ΔT3L  =  0 for E  ≫  MWL and given that ΔT3R  =  1 we expect transitions with |Δ(B  -  L)|  =  2.

To understand these B violations, it is instructive to study the partial unification:

[formula]

in which SU(4)C contains SU(3)C  ×  U(1)B  -  L. Eq.([\ref=PS]) is a subgroup of SO(10). By its study we find that NN̄ oscillations and NN  →   pions are predicted.

The Left-Right model is the simplest and oldest extension of the standard model. Amongst its predictions:

Non-vanishing m(ν).

ΔB = 2,ΔL = 0 and ΔL  =  2,ΔB  =  0 processes.

331-Model

The motivation is to understand better the three families.

The testability is by new accessible particles, most notably the bilepton gauge boson which can be the doubly charged Y-  -.

In the SM, each family separately cancels the trangle anomaly. A possible reason for three families is that in an extension of the SM the extended families are anomalous but there is inter-family cancellation.

The three families must enter asymmetrically to set up the +1+1-2 type of anomaly cancellation.

If we assume the first two families are treated symmetrically - sequentially - then the -2 may be expected to arise from Q(u) / Q(d)  =   - 2, This is how it happens.

We take the gauge group:

[formula]

Hence 331-Model[\cite=331]. The standard U(1)Y is contained in SU(3)L and U(1)X while SU(2)L is a subgroup of SU(3)L.

The first family of quarks is assigned as:

[formula]

where the triplet is a L of SU(3)L with X  =   - 1 / 3, X being the electric charge of the middle component. The second family of quarks is assigned similarly:

[formula]

The third family of quarks is assigned differently as:

[formula]

where the triplet is now * L with X  =   + 2 / 3.

The leptons are treated democratically by assigning:

[formula]

Each triplet is a * L with X  =  0.

With this arrangement of quarks and leptons, all anomalies cancel. Non-trivial inter-family cancellations take place for (3L)3, (3L)2X, and X3.

The number of families must be a multiple of three.

And with six or more families there would be a new replication problem.

The Higgs sector is comprised of three triplets and a sextet:

[formula]

The scale U at which SU(3)L  ×  U(1)X  →  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y has an upper limit for the following reason:

The embedding requires that sin 2θ  <  0.25. But at the Z mass, sin 2θ  >  0.23 and increases through 0.25 at a scale [formula]TeV. So U must be appreciably below this to avoid a Landau pole gX  →    ∞  .

This implies that M(Y-  -,Q)  <  1TeV.

The heavy exotic quarks Q can be saught in the usual way.

The bilepton can be seen in e+e- or hadron colliders. Its most striking signature is surely in e-e-  →  μ-μ- (NLC) or μ-μ-  →  e-e- (muon collider) where it appears as a sharp peak in the cross-section. A detailed plot can be found in [\cite=331].

SU(15) Model

The motivation is unification without proton decay.

The testability is the prediction, possibly recently confirmed, of weak-scale scalar leptoquarks.

In the conventional GUT paradigm, e.g. SU(5), the couplings α1,α2,α3 unify at MGUT to a single αGUT, hence offering a constraint on the αi. With SU(5), and likewise the larger unifying groups SO(10) and E(6), however, proton decay occurs at leading order mediated by gauge bosons with definite (B - L) but indefinite separate B and L.

SU(15) was proposed in 1990 as a GUT in which gauge mediated proton decay is absent. It has renewed interest in 1997 because it predicts light leptoquarks.

The symmetry-breaking pattern is:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Once MA is chosen, MB and MG follow from renormalization group analysis. It is natural to put MA  =  MW in which case all scales are fixed. The families are each put in one fundamental representation, e.g.

[formula]

Anomaly cancellation is by mirror fermions.

The scales MB and MG follow from MA as:

[formula]

The reason gauge bosons have a definite B and L is because there are only defining representation 15s for the fermions. The 10 in SU(5) is antisymmetric and this couples to gauge bosons with indefinite B and L.

The breaking at MW involves the SM Higgs doublet which is contained in an SU(15) 120:

[formula]

Under 3-2-1, this decomposes into:

[formula]

The two terms exhibited are a candidate scalar leptoquark:

[formula]

and the standard Higgs doublet respectively. Since these are in a common SU(15) irreducible representation, the leptoquark is predicted at the weak scale[\cite=SU15].

In February 1997, the two major collaborations at HERA, H1[\cite=H1] and ZEUS[\cite=ZEUS], both announced a small number of events consistent with a direct-channel resonance in e+p with mass [formula]GeV. It is most easily interpreted as involving valence quarks (u or d), and to be scalar rather than vector.

It is therefore naturally accommodated in the SU(15) model as the (3,2)+ 7 / 3 scalar leptoquark.

Several further leptoquark states are predicted.

Predicted leptoquarks in the 120 of SU(15), at or near the weak scale, with (3C,2L,Y):

B=+1/3,L=+1. (3,3, - 2 / 3) + (3,1, - 2 / 3)

B=+1/3,L=-1. (3,2, + 7 / 3) (discovered?)

B=-1/3,L=-1. (,2, - 1 / 3) + (,2, - 7 / 3)

B=-1/3,L=-1. (,1, + 2 / 3) + (,1, + 8 / 3)

The conjugate representation, *  , is necessarily also present.

Thus, if the SU(15) interpretation of the HERA data is correct, several additional states should be discovered shortly.

Summary

The examples were intended to illustrate how to motivate a model by looking at the parameters of the SM, as well as the gauge group and matter representations e.g. the three families.

Whether a given model will be testable is often hard to see in advance and can only be checked a posteriori.

Let's hope some challenging models will be added before LHC is commissioned!
