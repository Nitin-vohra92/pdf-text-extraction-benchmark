The Deligne-Lusztig curve associated to the Suzuki group

. Throughout this paper by a curve we mean a projective, geometrically irreducible, and non-singular algebraic curve defined over the finite field [formula] with q elements.

Let Nq(g) denote the maximum number of [formula]-rational points that a curve of genus g can have. The number Nq(g) is bounded from above by the Hasse-Weil bound. A curve X of genus g is said to be optimal over [formula], if its number of [formula]-rational points [formula] is equal to Nq(g). Optimal curves are very useful for applications to coding theory via Goppa construction [\cite=go].

Besides maximal curves over [formula], that is, curves whose number of [formula]-rational points attains the Hasse-Weil bound and some curves of small genus, the only known examples of optimal curves are the Deligne-Lusztig curves associated to the Suzuki group Sz(q) and to the Ree group R(q) [\cite=dl], [\cite=h]. Arithmetical and geometrical properties of maximal curves were studied in [\cite=rsti], [\cite=i], [\cite=gvl] (see the references therein), [\cite=ft] and [\cite=fgt]. The other mentioned optimal curves were studied in [\cite=hsti], [\cite=h], [\cite=p] and [\cite=hp]. Hansen and Pedersen [\cite=hp] stated the uniqueness, up to [formula]-isomorphism, of the curve corresponding to R(q) based on the genus, the number of [formula]-rational points, and the group of [formula]-automorphisms of the curve. They observed a similar result for the curve corresponding to Sz(q) (cf. [\cite=hp]) as a consequence of its uniqueness up to [formula]-isomorphism (cf. [\cite=he]). Hence, by [\cite=hsti], the curve under study in this paper is [formula]-isomorphic to the plane curve given by

[formula]

where q0 = 2s and q = 2q0. Its genus is q0(q - 1) and its number of [formula]-rational points is q2 + 1 (loc. cit.).

In this note, we will be mainly concerned with the uniqueness, up to [formula]-isomorphism, of the Deligne-Lusztig curve associated to Sz(q) based on the genus and the number of [formula]-rational points of the curve only. Our main result is the following

For [formula], set  q0: = 22s and q: = 2q0. Let X be a curve over [formula] of genus g satisfying the following hypotheses:

g = q0(q - 1);

[formula].

Then X is [formula]-isomorphic to the Deligne-Lusztig curve associated to the Suzuki group Sz(q).

We also state an analogous result for the Hermitian curve over [formula], that is, the curve defined by [formula], with q a square. This is a maximal curves over [formula] whose genus is the biggest genus that a maximal curve over [formula] can have, namely [formula] (cf. [\cite=ih]). Several characterizations of Hermitian curves have already been given, see e.g. [\cite=hstv] (and the references therein), [\cite=rsti] and [\cite=ft]. We remark that a Hermitian curve is a Deligne-Lusztig curve associated to a projective special linear group (cf. [\cite=h]). It is unique up to [formula] (cf. [\cite=hp]) because of its uniqueness up to [formula] (cf. [\cite=sti]). We also remark that Theorem [\ref=thm2] below follows from the results in [\cite=ft] (here, we give a new proof).

Let X be a curve over [formula] of genus g satisfying the following hypotheses:

[formula];

[formula] (i.e. X is maximal over [formula]).

Then X is [formula]-isomorphic to the Hermitian curve over [formula]. In particular [formula].

To prove these theorems we use geometrical properties of the Zeta Function of curves [\cite=fgt] and a particular case of the theory of Frobenius orders associated to linear system of curves which was developed by Stöhr and Voloch [\cite=sv] for an improvement of the Hasse-Weil bound.

It is a pleasure to thank: R. Pellikaan and H. Stichtenoth for useful conversations; A. Cossidente for having let me include his observation in this paper (see Appendix). There he points out a relation between the Deligne-Lusztig curve associated to the Suzuki group and the Suzuki-Tits ovoid. I also thank Prof. J.F. Voloch for his interest in this work.

. A lemma on non-gaps. Let X be a curve satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=thm1], and FrJ the Frobenius endomorphism (relative to [formula]) of the Jacobian J  =  JX of X. Then, by Serre-Weil's explicit formulae (cf. [\cite=se], [\cite=h]),

[formula]

is the characteristic polynomial of FrJ. Furthermore,

[formula]

due to the semi-simplicity of FrJ and the fact that the representation of endomorphisms of J on the Tate module is faithful (cf. [\cite=ta], [\cite=l]).

Let [formula] and consider the natural map f = fP0:X  →  J giving by P  ↦  [P  -  P0]. By using [formula], where FrX stands for the Frobenius morphism on X relative to [formula], we then have

[formula]

It turns out that X is equipped with the linear system

[formula]

which is independent of [formula] by ([\ref=eq1]).

Let X be a curve satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=thm1]. For each [formula], the first positive non-gap at Q is q.

Let [formula] be such that div∞(x) = mQ, m being the first positive non-gap at Q. We show firstly that q is a non-gap at a generic point of X ([\cite=fgt]). Applying (as in [\cite=har]) FrX to the equivalence in ([\ref=eq1]) we obtain

[formula]

Consequently, if FriX(P)  ≠  P, i = 1,2,3, q is a non-gap at P. In particular

[formula]

where P is a non-Weierstrass point and m1(P) is the first positive non-gap at P. On the other hand, [formula] (see e.g. [\cite=le]) and so m  ≥  q. Now the result follows.

. The linear system D. Let X be a curve of genus g satisfying the hypothesis of the theorem. We are going to apply [\cite=sv] to the linear system D introduced in . The key property of D will be the fact that FrX(P) belongs to the tangent line at P for a generic P (see Claim [\ref=claim3](1)).

For P∈X, let [formula] be the (D,P)-orders ([\cite=sv]) and mi(P) the ith non-gap at P (m0(P): = 0). If [formula], from ([\ref=eq1]) we have mr(P) = q + 2q0 + 1 and

[formula]

Then by Lemma [\ref=lemma1] and ([\ref=eq2]),

[formula]

Let [formula] be the orders of D (i.e. the (D,P)-orders for P generic). From ([\ref=eq1]) we see that 1,2q0,q are orders for D. Thus r  ≥  3 and ε1 = 1. Therefore

[formula]

because εi  ≤  ji(P) ([\cite=sv]). Let [formula] be the [formula]-Frobenius orders of D (which is obtained from the order sequence by deleting an specific order; cf. [\cite=sv]). These numbers satisfy [\cite=sv]

[formula]

From ([\ref=eq1]) we have that FrX(P) belongs to the osculating hyperplane at P provided that [formula]. Consequently νr - 1  =  εr = q.

εr - 1 = 2q0.

Suppose that εr - 1  >  2q0. Then, by ([\ref=eq4]), εr - 2 = 2q0 and εr - 1 = 2q0 + 1. Moreover, by ([\ref=eq5]) and ([\ref=eq3]), νr - 2  ≤  2q0  =  εr - 2. Hence the [formula]-Frobenius orders of D would be [formula], and εr = q.

Associated to D there exists an effective divisor S on X such that

[formula]

For [formula], we have

[formula]

as follows from [\cite=sv], ([\ref=eq3]) and νr - 1 = q. Thus [formula], and from the formula for  deg(S), 2g - 2 = (2q0 - 2)(q + 2q0 + 1), and [formula] it follows that

[formula]

Now, as εi  +  εj  ≤  εi + j for i + j  ≤  r [\cite=e], then we would have

[formula]

and hence εi  +  εr - 2 - i  =  εr - 2 for [formula]. In particular, εr - 3 = 2q0 - 1 and by the p-adic criterion (cf. [\cite=sv] we would have εi = i for [formula]. These facts imply r = 2q0 + 2.

Finally, we are going to see that this is a contradiction via Castelnuovo's genus bound for curves in projective spaces. We notice that νr - 2 = 2q0, ([\ref=eq3]) and ([\ref=eq5]) imply j1(P) = 1 for [formula]. Then, by ([\ref=eq2]), mr - 1(P) = q + 2q0 and hence D is simple. Therefore Castelnuovo's formula (see [\cite=c], [\cite=acgh], [\cite=ra]) applied to D implies

[formula]

For r = 2q0 + 2 this gives 2q0(q - 1) < (q + q0)2 / 2q0 = q0q + q / 2 + q0 / 2, a contradiction.

There exists [formula] such that

[formula]

By ([\ref=eq6]), it is enough to show that there exists [formula] such that vP1(S) = r + 2q0. Suppose that vP(S)  ≥  r + 2q0 + 1 for each [formula]. Then from the formula for  deg(S) we would have that

[formula]

and, as ε1 = 1, νr - 1 = q and νi  ≤  εi + 1, that

[formula]

By [\cite=e], we then conclude that rεr - 1  ≥  2rq0 + 4, i.e. εr - 1 > 2rq0, a contradiction (cf. Claim [\ref=claim1]).

ν1  >  ε1 = 1.

ε2 is a power of two.

Statement (2) is consequence of the p-adic criterion [\cite=sv]. Suppose that ν1 = 1. Then by Lemma [\ref=lemma1], Claim [\ref=claim2], ([\ref=eq3]) and ([\ref=eq2]) there would be a point P1∈X such that the Weierstrass semigroup at P1 would contain the semigroup H: = 〈q,q + 2q0 - 1,q + 2q0,q + 2q0 + 1〉. Then [formula], a contradiction (cf. Remark below).

In the remaining part of this section let [formula] be a point satisfying Claim [\ref=claim2]. We set mi: = mi(P1) and denote by v the valuation at P1.

By Claim [\ref=claim3](1) we have νi  =  εi + 1 for [formula]. Therefore from ([\ref=eq2]), ([\ref=eq3]) and Claim [\ref=claim2],

[formula]

Let [formula] be such that div∞(x) = m1P1, and div∞(yi) = miP1 for [formula]. Let denote by D(i) the ith Hasse derivative defined by the separating variable x. The fact that ν1 > 1 means that the following matrix has rank two (cf. [\cite=sv])

[formula]

In particular,

[formula]

For [formula], the divisor (2g - 2)P is canonical, i.e. the Weierstrass semigroup at P is symmetric.

Let m be a non-gap at [formula]. If m < q + 2q0, then m  ≤  q + q0.

For [formula] there exists [formula] such that D(1)yi = gε2i. Furthermore, [formula].

(1) Since 2g - 2 = (2q0 - 2)(q + 2q0 + 1), by ([\ref=eq1]) we can assume P = P1. Now the case i = r of Eqs. ([\ref=eq8]) implies v(dx) = 2g - 2 and we are done.

(2) The numbers q,q + 2q0 and q + 2q0 + 1 are non-gaps at P1 (cf. ([\ref=eq7])). Then the numbers

[formula]

are also non-gaps at P1. Therefore from the symmetry of the Weierstrass semigroup at P1,

[formula]

are gaps at P1. Now the proof follows.

(3) Set fi: = D(1)yi. By the product rule applied to ([\ref=eq8]), D(j)yi = (xq - x)D(j)fi + D(j - 1)fi for 1  ≤  j < q. Then, D(j)fi = 0 for 1  ≤  j < ε2, because the matrices

[formula]

have rank two. Therefore, as ε2 is a power of 2 (cf. Claim [\ref=claim3](2)), by [\cite=hasse], fi = gε2i for some [formula].

Finally, from the proof of item (1) we have that x - x(P) is a local parameter at P if P  ≠  P1. Then, by the election of the yi's, gi has no pole but in P1, and from ([\ref=eq8]), v(gi) =  - (qmi - q2) / ε2.

r = 4 and ε2 = q0.

We know that r  ≥  3. We claim that r  ≥  4; in fact, if r = 3 we would have ε2 = 2q0, m1 = q, m2 = q + 2q0, m3 = q + 2q0 + 1, and hence v(g2) =  - q (g2 being as in Claim [\ref=claim4](3)). Therefore, after some [formula]-linear transformations, the case i = 2 of ([\ref=eq8]) reads

[formula]

Now the function z: = yq02 - xq0 + 1 satisfies zq - z = xq0(xq - x) and we find that q0 + q is a non-gap at P1 (cf. [\cite=hsti]). This contradiction eliminates the case r = 3.

Let r  ≥  4 and 2  ≤  i  ≤  r. By Claim [\ref=claim4](3), (qmi - q2) / ε2 is a non-gap at P1, and since (qmi - q2) / ε2  ≥  mi - 1  ≥  q, from ([\ref=eq7]) we have

[formula]

In particular, ε2  ≤  q0. On the other hand, by Claim [\ref=claim4](2) we must have mr - 2  ≤  q + q0 and so, by ([\ref=eq7]), we find that ε2  ≥  q0, i.e. ε2 = q0.

Finally we show that r = 4. ε2 = q0 implies εr - 2  ≤  q0. Since m2  ≤  q + q0 (cf. Claim [\ref=claim4](2)), by ([\ref=eq7]), we have εr - 2  ≥  q0. Therefore εr - 2 = q0  =  ε2, i.e. r = 4.

. Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1]. Let [formula] be as above. By ([\ref=eq8]), Claim [\ref=claim4](3) and Claim [\ref=claim5] we have the following equation

[formula]

where g2 has no pole except at P1. Moreover from ([\ref=eq7]) we have that m2 = q0 + q and hence that v(g2) =  - q (cf. [\ref=claim4](3)). Thus g2 = ax + b with [formula], a  ≠  0, and after some [formula]-linear transformations we obtain Theorem [\ref=thm1]. . Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm2]. The proof will be similar to the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1]. Let X be a curve satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=thm2].

It is well known that the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius endomorphism of the Jacobian of a maximal curve over [formula] of genus g is [formula]. Then, as in , X is equipped with the linear system [formula] with [formula]. Here for each P∈X,

[formula]

As in , let [formula] be the (D,P)-orders at P, [formula] (resp. [formula]) the orders of D (resp. the [formula]-Frobenius orders of D). By ([\ref=last]), νr - 1  =  εr, [formula] for each [formula], and 1 and [formula] are (D,P)-orders for each [formula]. Then j1(P) = 1 and [formula] at [formula]. In this case we have [formula]: in fact, if [formula], by ([\ref=last]), we would have [formula], i.e. P  ~  FrX(P) and so g = 0, a contradiction. Therefore [formula]. Now, the invariants of D also satisfy properties ([\ref=eq2]) and ([\ref=eq5]) above. The case i = r - 1 of ([\ref=eq5]) gives j1(P) = 1 for each [formula]. Hence by ([\ref=eq2]) we find that [formula] for each [formula]. It follows that D is simple. Now by using the hypothesis on g and Castelnuovo's genus bound we find that r = 2 (cf. [\cite=ft]).

Then, by using the ramification divisor of D, we have that [formula] (see [\cite=ft]). Fix [formula], [formula] with [formula], and [formula]. Then [formula] and consequently div(dx) = (2g - 2)P0( * ), because H(P0) is symmetric.

By [formula] we have an equation of type

[formula]

with f: = D1y (derivation with respect to x), and by [formula] we have the following rank 2 matrices

[formula]

By ( * ) and ([\ref=last1]), div∞(f) = qP0. Then D(j)y = 0 for [formula] and from ([\ref=last1]) we have that D(j)f = 0 for [formula]. Then by [\cite=hasse], there exists [formula] such that [formula]. Therefore f1 = ax + b with [formula], [formula], and after some [formula]-linear transformations we obtain an equation of type

[formula]

with [formula]. Now the proof follows.

Appendix: On the Suzuki-Tits ovoid

For [formula], let q0: = 2s and q: = 2q0. It is well known that the Suzuki-Tits ovoid O can be represented in [formula] as

[formula]

where f(a,b): = a2q0 + 1 + b2q0 (see [\cite=tits], [\cite=pent])

Let X be the Deligne-Lusztig curve associated to Sz(q) and D = |(q + 2q0 + 1)P0|, [formula] (see ). By Remark (3), we can associate to D a morphism π = (1:x:y:z:w) whose coordinates satisfy div∞(x) = qP0, div∞(y) = (q + q0)P0, div∞(z) = (q + 2q0)P0 and div∞(w) = q + 2q0 + 1.

We have π(P0) = (0:0:0:0:1); we can choose x and y satisfying the plane equation (given in ) of the curve, z: = x2q0 + 1 + y2q0, and w: = xy2q0 + z2q0 = xy2q0 + x2q + 2q0 + y2q (cf. [\cite=hsti]). For [formula] set a: = x(P), b: = y(P), and f(a,b): = z(a,b). Then w(a,b) = af(a,b) + b2 and we are done.
