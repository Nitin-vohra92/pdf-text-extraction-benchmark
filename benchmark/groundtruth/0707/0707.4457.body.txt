Introduction

Long-term sensor stability is a requirement for the application of high temperature superconducting DC-SQUID gradiometers. Changes in the electrical characteristics of sensors lead to decreased performance and a higher cost of the final system. The most sensitive areas of the gradiometer are the Josephson junctions, which we create using a single layer bicrystal technology. An overview of the properties of grain boundary Josephson junctions is given in [\cite=Gross2005]. A possible cause for degradation of superconducting thin films is the diffusion of oxygen in the YBCO layer. In monocrystalline films the oxygen transport occurs along the a-b plane of the crystals [\cite=Aarnink1992]. At growth defects or grain boundaries a significant oxygen diffusion appears along the c-axis of the epitaxially grown film [\cite=kittelberger1998] [\cite=Tian1999]. Therefore a passivation at the sides and on top of the superconducting thin film is necessary to reduce diffusion. We developed a process to compensate for height differences during fabrication and protect our sensors using different materials to achieve stability over a period of more than one year.

Fabrication

The sensors described here are galvanically coupled DC-SQUID gradiometers (for layout see figure [\ref=layout]). The YBCO thin films having a thickness of 150 ~  are grown along the c-axis on SrTiO3 bicrystal substrates with pulsed laser deposition [\cite=Seidel2005]. The thin films are patterned with Ar-ion beam etching and planarized in situ via the deposition of 150 ~  amorphous YBCO with RF-sputtering. For repeated measurements with different combinations of readout gradiometers and flux transformers the sensors need to be protected against mechanical damage and require high-quality bond contacts. The direct contact between readout gradiometer and flux transformer in the flip-chip package can lead to damages in the thin films which influence the electrical properties of the system. A protective layer is also necessary to reduce diffusion of oxygen and to avoid contact between the superconducting thin film and environmental humidity. In our current setup we use SiO2 for this layer on the top of the YBCO film. Further details regarding the thin film system is given in [\cite=Seidel2007].

We developed a new technique to prepare the the bonding pads of the sample. The aim was to improve the adhesion of the bond wire and to lower the contact resistance. Therefore, prior the YBCO deposition, we grow a 50 ~  thin gold layer on the substrate using a lift-off technique. During heating of the substrate to the deposition temperature of 750�C the gold layer clusters to small islands with a diameter of 1 - 2 ~ μ (see figure [\ref=gold]). Between these islands the YBCO growths well c-oriented with a rocking-curve width of less than 0.3� and a critical temperature higher than 86 ~ . The contact resistance of an average bonding pad was lowered from 160 ~ Ω (without gold clusters) to < 4 ~ Ω (with gold clusters).

The SQUID consists of two Josephson junctions with a width of 3 ~ μ and a galvanic coupling to the antenna structures. The pickup loops of the antenna structure are used in a gradiometric configuration. An external magnetic field gradient leads to a difference in magnetic flux in the antenna structures. This difference is galvanically coupled into the SQUID with the current ΔI (see figure [\ref=layoutInnerPart]) and an inductance of the incoupling line of the SQUID loop LM. The length of the SQUID loop is either l  =  50 ~ μ or in a second layout l  =  70 ~ μ (see figure [\ref=layoutInnerPart]), the width of the incoupling lines is 5 ~ μ and the inner hole area is 4 ~ μ wide. In former investigations we have shown that for a film thickness of about 150 ~  the inductance LM of a DC-SQUID with a width of the incoupling lines of 5 ~ μ and an inner area of 3 ~ μ can be estimated by a factor of 1.05 ~ μ times the loop length. The decrease of the width of incoupling lines to 4 ~ μ and the increase of the width of the inner area to 5 ~ μ increase this factor to a value of about 1.8 ~ μ [\cite=Schmidl1999]. With these specifications we estimate the coupling inductance of the DC-SQUIDs in our gradiometers to be in the range of 50 ~  in the ideal case, up to 90 ~  for a loop length of 50 ~ μ. The exact value depends on the accuracy of the photolithography and patterning process. To determine the coupling inductance we usually measure the flux modulation of the DC-SQUID with a current directly coupled into the SQUID loop [\cite=Wunderlich1999]. This precise method is only possible after disconnecting the antenna structures so that these measurements can only be done after the long term experiments.

To optimize the coupling between the antenna of the readout gradiometer and the antenna of the flux transformer we used different widths Want for the antenna of the readout gradiometer (200 ~ μ, 400 ~ μ and 600 ~ μ, see figure [\ref=layout])[\cite=Peiselt2003].

The flux transformer is prepared on a separate substrate (see figure [\ref=layoutFlipChip]). We used two different substrate materials and TBCCO as the superconducting thin film material. The comparison between YBCO and TBCCO on different subtrate materials for the flux transformer has shown that TBCCO leads to the best sensor performance, i.e. the lowest white noise level, due to a better flux pinning in unshielded environment [\cite=Seidel2007a]. The size of the complete flux transformer is 8  ×  40 ~ 2 and the baselength bf is 19 ~ . After patterning by wet etching 300 ~  of SiO2 are deposited on the flux transformer as protection against chemical and mechanical influences. The two pickup loops of the flux transformer are connected in parallel. The current caused by a difference in magnetic flux is inductively coupled to the readout gradiometer with an S-shaped superconducting line, which is optimized to the dimensions of the readout gradiometer.

Electrical Characteristics

We focused our measurements on the electrical characteristics at liquid nitrogen temperatures. The sensors were evaluated over a period of one year in a magnetically shielded environment (two layers of μ-metal) to reduce the influence of external disturbances. During this period each sensor was cooled and then heated to room temperature ten times to simulate environmental stress during the normal sensor lifetime. Between the measurements the gradiometers and flux transformers were stored at room temperature with a humidity of 40-45%.

To measure their I-V characteristics, the DC-SQUID gradiometers were biased with different currents and the resulting voltage signal was amplified and recorded. With this information we calculated the critical current IC, normal state resistance RN and the ICRN product (see figure [\ref=icrn]). The ICRN product allows to compare different types of Josephson junctions independent of the junction geometry. This parameter should change significantly if degradation between the measurements occurs. To evaluate the response to external magnetic fields we calculated the transfer function of the sensors over time (see figure [\ref=transf]). At a fixed bias current the maximum voltage modulation Vpp is measured as a function of the current in a small copper coil IM. Assuming a sinusodial V(IM) characteristic the transfer function VΦ can be calculated as VΦ  =  π  ·  Vpp.

Experimental Results

An important improvement to realize sensors with a long lifetime was the usage of SiO2 passivation layers and amorphous YBCO films. As a first step we examined whether there is a negative influence of the passivation on the superconducting properties of the sensors. With all tested sensors the SiO2 thin film did not change the electrical characteristics and the dielectric influence is negligible compared to the influence of the substrate material (SrTiO3).

The planarisation of the structures with amorphous YBCO deposited by hollow cathode sputtering does not lead to a large change of the superconducting properties of bicrystal Josephson junctions. In some cases we observed a slight increase of the critical current, compared to bicrystal junctions without planarisation. This can be caused by oxygen diffusion between the planarisation layer consisting of YBCO7 - x with x  ≈  0 and the crystalline thin film with 0.1  >  x  >  0. An increase of the critical current is primarily observed for bicrystal angles of 30� and above.

During the the processing of the gradiometer, especially during the dry etching and photolithography steps a temperature increase of the thin film up to 100�C accelerates the diffusion of oxygen into the area of the Josephson junctions instead of out of this area as observed without amorphous YBCO planarisation thin films. To lower the rate of diffusion out of the antenna areas the substrate is cooled by liquid nitrogen during the dry etching procedure [\cite=Schneidewind1995] [\cite=Alff1992].

The comparison among gradiometers (see figure [\ref=icrn]) shows a large spread of the ICRN product due to different current densities of the grain boundary junctions used for these experiments. All of these junctions show the typical scaling behaviour for grain boundary junctions [\cite=Seidel2007a]. Compared to previous experiments by other groups only the ICRN value of 30 ~ μ for the 30� grain boundary junction (curve F) is relatively low [\cite=Minotani1997]. The experimental investigations of the long term stability shows no relevant changes or signs of degradation in most cases (see figure [\ref=icrn]). Only small changes of the ICRN product were measured. In all of these cases the reason for this behaviour was a decrease of the respective critical current. A decreasing IC does not automatically lead to a decrease in the transfer function, as aging processes can change RN at the same time.

The 24� and 30� grain boundary junctions used in our experiments exhibit relatively high critical current densities. In combination with a width of the SQUID structures in the range of 3 ~ μ the critical currents can be as high as 100 ~ μ. With high critical currents the inductance parameter βL can exceed the optimum value (≤  1), which leads to a decreasing transfer function [\cite=Wunderlich1999] [\cite=Wunderlich2000]. Higher βL values reduce the voltage modulation due to a screening of the flux which is coupled into the SQUID. Therefore a slight decrease of the critical current results in an improvement of the transfer function (sample B and E). Such a decrease can be caused by diffusion during the processing of the superconducting thin film or by slower diffusion during normal operation of the sensor.

In the case of increasing critical current (sample G) we see a reduction of the transfer function VΦ in figure [\ref=transf]. In our experiments the transfer function increased significantly for only one sample with a 30� grain boundary (sample F); the reason for this is topic of future investigations. The fabricated gradiometers display a large spread in the transfer function with a minimum of 10 ~ μ. However, all sensors were able to operate in unshielded environment with commercially available SQUID electronics (Magnicon, Philips).

In the next step we have measured various combinations of readout gradiometers and flux transformers in shielded as well as in unshielded environment [\cite=Seidel2007a]. The field gradient resolution [formula] is proportional to the flux noise [formula] and depends on the effective area of the configuration Aef f and the base length b:

[formula]

The responsitivity of a gradiometer is defined as the product of effective area and base length. Figure [\ref=fieldresolution] shows as an example the increase of the field gradient resolution in unshielded environment for the readout gradiometer (sample G) in comparison to the flip chip configuration. Due to the large flux transformer the flip chip configuration with a higher base length (bf  ≈  1.9) and an increased effective area (Aef f  ≈  0.222)

The field gradient resolution as a function of the responsitivity for different read out gradiometers at 1 Hz and white noise region is illustrated in figure [\ref=noise]. By changing the width of readout gradiometer antenna want the responsitivity can be adjusted but the field gradient resolution is mostly unchanged. The reason for this behaviour is the higher flux noise in unshielded environment for larger antenna widths. Especially the largest incoupling inductance LM (loop length l  =  70 ~ μ) together with the largest antenna width results in the largest responsitivity (> 0.06 ~   ·  2, [formula]), but leads to a relatively low field gradient resolution in unshielded environment, caused by the large flux noise of [formula] in comparison to the lower value of about [formula] for the other gradiometer layouts.

This means that, for the development of sensors in flip chip configuration, it can be helpful to optimize the readout gradiometers in the direction of low flux noise in unshielded environment, not in the direction of higher responsitivity. As in the same figure shown we realized the best value in the field gradient resolution with the readout gradiometer with the lowest level in the flux noise ([formula], l = 50 ~ μ, 200 ~ μ line width, [formula]) in unshielded environment not with the sensor with the higher responsitivity (0.04 ~   ·  2). If the readout gradiometer alone has a large responsitivity (Aef f  ·  b) the additional flux transformer only improves the field gradient resolution by a factor of two.

With a similar flux noise, it should be possible to reduce the field gradient resolution significantly due to the higher responsitivity of the combination of readout gradiometer and flux transformer. We are able to achieve a reduction by a factor of 5, corresponding to a field gradient resolution of [formula] at frequencies around 1 Hz and a reduction by a factor of 20 ([formula]) at higher frequencies, showing the effectiveness of this approach.

Summary

The developed and fabricated sensors were successfully protected by a combination of an amorphous YBCO and SiO2 layers against oxygen diffusion. After a period of one year no significant signs of degradation were detected.

With TBCCO flux transformers on LaAlO3 substrates stacked with readout gradiometers, we achieve a field gradient noise of [formula] for the white noise level and [formula] at 1 Hz in unshielded environments. We are continuing to investigate the stability over longer time periods and include the noise investigations in shielded as well as unshielded environment.
