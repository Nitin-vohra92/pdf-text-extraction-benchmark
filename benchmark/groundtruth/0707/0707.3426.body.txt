Reproducing Kernels, de Branges-Rovnyak Spaces, and Norms of Weighted Composition operators

If H is a vector space of functions defined on a set X, given a function b:X  →  X one can define a composition operator Cb by (Cbf)(x) = f(b(x)). When H is the Hardy space [formula], the Hilbert space of functions analytic in the open unit disk [formula] equipped with the norm

[formula]

the composition operator Cb is bounded for every analytic map [formula], and

[formula]

The standard proof of these facts appeals to the Littlewood subordination principle in harmonic analysis; see [\cite=MR1397026].

In this note we give a proof of the boundedness of Cb on H2 which does not use the Littlewood subordination principle, only reproducing kernel methods. The idea behind the proof is to express the boundedness of certain weighted composition operators TfCb in terms of the positivity of kernels related to b and H2, in particular the kernels of the de Branges-Rovnyak spaces. The boundedness of Cb is obtained as a corollary by a suitable choice of the weight function f. This proof is easily adapted to prove boundedness, with norm estimates, of Cb on the standard weighted Bergman spaces. We also obtain a sufficient condition for boundedness of composition operators on the standard scale of Hilbert function spaces on the unit ball of [formula].

We first fix some notation. For [formula], the Szeg kernel k(z,w) is defined by

[formula]

k is the reproducing kernel for the Hardy space H2, i.e. for every f∈H2 and every [formula] we have 〈f,kw〉 = f(w). Let [formula] with [formula], to avoid trivialities we assume b is non-constant. The de Branges-Rovnyak space H(b) is the reproducing kernel Hilbert space on [formula] with kernel

[formula]

Equivalently, H(b) may be defined as the linear subspace of H2 equal to the range of the operator (I  -  TbT * b)1 / 2, equipped with the range norm. The standard references for de Branges-Rovnyak spaces are the books [\cite=MR0215065] and [\cite=MR1289670].

For any function [formula], there is a densely defined operator T*f on H2, defined on the Szeg kernel kw by [formula] and extended linearly. (The adjoint notation here is only formal; if f∈H∞ then T*f is bounded and equal to the adjoint of the Toeplitz operator Tf.) We define the operator C*b on the linear span of the Szeg kernels by C*bkw = kb(w). If f∈H2 and [formula], then

[formula]

so the operator C*b is the formal adjoint of the composition operator Cb, so to prove Cb is bounded it suffices to prove that C*b is bounded. It then follows that C*b is the genuine adjoint of Cb.

For any f∈H(b), the operator C*bT*f is bounded on H2 and [formula].

We assume [formula]; the general case follows by rescaling. Put f0 = f and choose unit vectors [formula] such that (fm)m  ≥  0 is an orthonormal basis for H(b). Then

[formula]

which we rewrite as

[formula]

The kernel

[formula]

is therefore positive semidefinite, being a sum of positive semidefinite kernels. Since we can rewrite the left-hand side as

[formula]

the positivity means that for any n distinct points [formula] in [formula] and complex numbers [formula], if we define h∈H2 by

[formula]

we then have

[formula]

or [formula]. Since such h are dense in H2, it follows that [formula].

As a corollary we can now prove that Cb is bounded on H2. We also note in the proof of Theorem [\ref=T:main] one could deduce the positivity of the left-hand side of equation ([\ref=E:main_eqn_2]) directly from the assumption [formula] (without mention of an orthonormal basis); however the proof given allows us to obtain Corollary [\ref=C:summation] below.

For any analytic map [formula], the composition operator Cb is bounded on H2, and

[formula]

If b is constant then the boundedness is trivial. For b non-constant, we apply Theorem 1 to the function

[formula]

the reproducing kernel for H(b) at the origin. We have [formula], and we observe that f and 1 / f are both bounded and analytic in [formula], since [formula] and |b(0)| < 1. It follows that the Toeplitz operator T*f is bounded and invertible with inverse T*1 / f, and [formula]. Thus

[formula]

It is well known that the estimate obtained in this corollary is sharp as b ranges over all self-maps [formula]; by a result of Nordgren [\cite=MR0223914] this bound is attained whenever b is an inner function. Also, it is clear from the above proof that for any Cb we have the norm estimate

[formula]

If we define Tfm in the obvious way on the range of Cb, we also obtain immediately from Theorem [\ref=T:main] the following summation identity:

If (fm)m  ≥  0 is any orthonormal basis for H(b), then

[formula]

where the sum converges in the strong operator topology.

Equation ([\ref=E:main_eqn]) shows that the sum

[formula]

converges to I in the weak operator topology. In fact, the sum converges in the strong operator topology: subtracting the first N terms of the sum on the right hand side of ([\ref=E:main_eqn]) from both sides of that equation shows that the partial sums of ([\ref=E:op_sum]) form an increasing sequence of positive operators bounded above (by I), so the series is strongly convergent.

Similar arguments can be used to prove the boundedness of Cb on the standard weighted Bergman spaces A2α when α is an integer: for α  ≥  1 we consider the spaces A2α with reproducing kernels

[formula]

When α = 1 this is of course the Szeg kernel; for α > 1 this is the reproducing kernel for the space of analytic functions in [formula] with norm

[formula]

For b a self map of the disk as before, we define for integers α  ≥  1 the space A(b,α) to be the space with reproducing kernel

[formula]

This kernel is positive since it is the α-fold Schur product of kb,1 = kb with itself. Letting Mf denote multiplication by f, the same arguments used in the Hardy space prove that if f∈A(b,α) then MfCb is bounded on A2α and

[formula]

Applying this inequality to the reproducing kernel for A(b,α) at the origin gives the estimate

[formula]

and more generally we obtain as in ([\ref=E:hardy_estimate])

[formula]

It is well known that on the standard Hilbert function spaces on the unit ball [formula], there are holomorphic maps [formula] which do not give bounded composition operators [\cite=MR740174] [\cite=MR783578]. It is therefore worth understanding why the proof above does not generalize to these spaces. We consider the spaces H2n,α for α  ≥  1, which we define for each α to be the space with reproducing kernel

[formula]

where 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 denotes the standard inner product in [formula]. When α = n this is the Hardy space on [formula], and when α = n + 1 this is the Bergman space. If we attempt to adapt the single-variable argument to this setting, we are led to consider in place of the de Branges-Rovnyak kernel the kernel

[formula]

However, even when α is an integer, this kernel is not positive semidefinite for all holomorphic maps [formula]. (When α = 1, this occurs because there exist holomorphic functions on [formula] bounded by 1 that do not act as contractive multipliers of the the Hilbert function space H2n,1; see e.g. [\cite=MR1882259].) Nonetheless, whenever this kernel is positive, the composition operator Cb is bounded on H2n,α and we obtain a norm estimate analogous to the one-variable case. This could be proved by a modification of the argument in the one variable case, except for one complication: in the proof of Corollary 2, we used the fact the the reciprocal of the reproducing kernel for H(b) induces a bounded multiplication operator on H2; this follows simply because the reciprocal of the kernel is bounded holomorphic function. However, on the ball (when α < n) the boundedness in the supremum norm is not sufficient to give a bounded multiplication operator, so an extra argument, provided by the following lemma, is necessary. For a holomorphic map [formula], we write [formula] for the coordinate functions of b, so each bi is a holomorphic map from [formula] to the unit disk and [formula] for all [formula]. Finally, for any [formula] we write [formula].

Let [formula] be a holomorphic map from [formula] into itself and let α  ≥  1. If the kernel

[formula]

is positive semidefinite on [formula], then each coordinate function bi is a contractive multiplier of H2n,α. Moreover the function

[formula]

is a bounded multiplier of H2n,α of norm at most (1 - |b(0)|)-  α.

Fix α  ≥  1 and let Mbi denote the operator of multiplication by bi on H2n,α. Assuming Kb,α is positive, the kernel

[formula]

is positive semidefinite, since it is the Schur product of the positive kernels Kb,α and (1 - 〈b(z),b(w)〉)1 - α. By a standard reproducing kernel argument, this kernel is positive if and only if the operator [formula] is positive. Thus each Mbi is contractive.

To prove the second statement, we first observe that for each [formula],

[formula]

To see this, note that the operator inequality

[formula]

may be interpreted as saying the column operator [formula] is contractive from H2n,α to the direct sum of n copies of this space with itself; and similarly for the row operator [formula] in the reverse direction. Since for any [formula], the column operator [formula] has norm |c|, we have

[formula]

The second claim of the lemma can now be proved by expanding the operator [formula] as a power series in [formula], which is norm convergent since [formula].

Let [formula] be a holomorphic map and let α  ≥  1. Suppose the kernel Kb,α(z,w) is positive semidefinite on [formula], and let H2n,α(b) denote the Hilbert space with kernel Kb,α. Then for all f∈H2n,α(b), the weighted composition operator MfCb is bounded on H2n,α and

[formula]

Moreover Cb is bounded on H2n,α and

[formula]

The first inequality is proved exactly as in the one-variable case. Similarly, by virtue of Lemma [\ref=L:one_over_k] the norm estimate for Cb follows from the estimate for the weighted operator applied to f(z) = Kb,α(z,0) as in Corollary [\ref=C:h2_bound].

For certain values of α (e.g α = n, the Hardy space) there are known necessary and sufficient conditions for the boundedness of Cb on H2n,α, given in terms of Carleson measures [\cite=MR783578]. Theorem [\ref=T:ball] tells us that positivity of Kb,α is sufficient for the boundedness of Cb on H2n,α. In the one-variable Hardy space, this condition is also necessary: the symbol of a bounded composition operator on H2 must belong to the unit ball of H∞, which coincides with the unit ball of the multiplier algebra of H2; the positivity of the de Branges-Rovnyak kernel follows. However in general the positivity of Kb,α is not necessary for the boundedness of Cb. For example, when n = 2 and α = 1 it can be shown by standard estimates that for the composition operator Cbr is bounded when 0  ≤  r < 1 and unbounded when r = 1. If the kernels Kbr,1 were positive for all r < 1 then by taking pointwise limits Kb1,1 would be positive as well, which by Theorem [\ref=T:ball] would make Cb1 bounded, a contradiction. Thus Kbr,1 is non-positive for r sufficiently close to 1.

In the ball, when α = 1, the positivity of Kb,1 is equivalent to the statement that the tuple [formula] is a row contraction. Recently, S. Shimorin [\cite=MR2139107] has proved that the positivity of Kb,1 is essentially equivalent to a commutant lifting theorem between H2n,1 and the space with reproducing kernel (1 - 〈b(z),b(w)〉)- 1. Also, it can be shown that the linear fractional maps of the unit ball introduced in [\cite=MR1768872] induce row contractions; we thus obtain a new proof of the boundedness of linear fractional composition operators on the ball, with norm estimates. This will be discussed in detail in a separate paper.

Finally, returning to Theorem 1, it is clear f∈H(b) is only a sufficient condition for the boundedness of TfCb on H2, not a necessary one; e.g. TfCb is bounded for all f∈H∞ but in general H(b) does not contain H∞. It follows from the theorem that TfCb is bounded for all f in the linear span of H∞  ·  H(b); however it is not clear how close this comes to describing all bounded weighted composition operators (with analytic weights). In particular, we do not know if this set of weights is "dense" in the set of all weights giving bounded operators, in the following sense: A necessary and sufficient condition for the boundedness of TfCb can be given in terms of Carleson measures [\cite=MR1864316], but the relationship between such conditions and the H(b) spaces is not immediately clear.
