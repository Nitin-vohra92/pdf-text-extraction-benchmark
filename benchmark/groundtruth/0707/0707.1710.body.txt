Iterating the Pimsner construction

§ 0. INTRODUCTION

In his seminal paper [\cite=Pi], Pimsner introduced a large class of C*-algebras generalizing both the Cuntz-Krieger algebras and the crossed products by an automorphism. The central notion is that of a Hilbert bimodule or C*-correspondence, which appeared also in the theory of subfactors. His construction was modified by Katsura (see [\cite=Ka1]) to include bimodules defined from graphs with sinks, or more generally, from topological graphs.

In the same way that a crossed product by [formula] could be thought as an iterated crossed product by [formula], we iterate the Pimsner construction for two "commuting" Hilbert bimodules over a C*-algebra. A basic example comes from a rank two graph of Kumjian and Pask (see [\cite=KP]), where the two bimodules correspond to the horizontal and vertical edges, and the commutation relation is given by the unique factorization property. We get a particular case of the product systems defined by Fowler (see [\cite=F2]), but our approach has the advantage that it generates some exact sequences of K-theory.

After some preliminaries about the algebras TE and OE, we describe how from a Hilbert module E over A and a map A  →  B we can get a Hilbert module over B, using a tensor product. Given two Hilbert bimodules E1,E2 over A and an isomorphism [formula] we consider [formula] and [formula] as Hilbert bimodules over TE1 and OE1 and repeat the Pimsner construction. The last section deals with a 3  ×  3 diagram involving the iterated Cuntz-Pimsner algebras, inspired from the work of Douglas and Howe (see [\cite=DH]) and Pimsner and Voiculescu (see [\cite=PV]). As a corollary, we obtain some exact sequences of K-theory, including information about the K-groups of the C*-algebra [formula]. Several examples are considered, including commuting endomorphisms of abelian C*-algebras.

Since this paper was completed, we discovered that J. Lindiarni and I. Raeburn ([\cite=LR]) already used the diagram which appears in our Lemma 4.2.

§ 1. PRELIMINARIES

Recall that a (right) Hilbert A-module is a Banach space E with a right action of a C*-algebra A and an A-valued inner product 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉:E  ×  E  →  A linear in the second variable such that

[formula]

A Hilbert module is called full if the closed linear span of the inner products coincides with A. We denote by L(E) the C*-algebra of adjointable operators on E, and by θξ,η∈L(E) the rank one operator

[formula]

The closed linear span of rank one operators is the ideal K(E). We have [formula], the multiplier algebra. Also, K(E) can be identified with the balanced tensor product [formula], where E* is the dual of E, a left Hilbert A-module.

A Hilbert bimodule over A (sometimes called a C*-correspondence from A to A) is a Hilbert A-module with a left action of A given by a homomorphism φ:A  →  L(E). A Hilbert bimodule is called faithful if φ is injective. The left action is nondegenerate if [formula]. For n  ≥  0 we denote by [formula] the Hilbert bimodule obtained by taking the tensor product of n copies of E, balanced over A (for [formula]). Recall that for n = 2, the inner product is given by

[formula]

and it is inductively defined for general n.

1.1 Definition. A Toeplitz representation of a Hilbert bimodule E over A in a C*-algebra C is a pair (τ,π) with τ:E  →  C a linear map and π:A  →  C a *-homomorphism, such that

[formula]

Note that the first property actually follows from the second. Indeed,

[formula]

[formula]

The corresponding universal C*-algebra is called the Toeplitz algebra of E, denoted by TE. If E is full, then TE is generated by elements τn(ξ)τm(η)*,m,n  ≥  0, where τ0  =  π and for [formula] is the extension of τ to [formula]. If E is also faithful, then A  ⊂  TE.

There is a homomorphism ψ:K(E)  →  C such that ψ(θξ,η) = τ(ξ)τ(η)*. A representation (τ,π) is Cuntz-Pimsner covariant if π(a) = ψ(φ(a)) for all a in the ideal

[formula]

The Cuntz-Pimsner algebra OE is universal with respect to the covariant representations, and it is a quotient of TE.

There is a gauge action of [formula] on TE and OE defined by

[formula]

and using the universal properties. The core FE is the fixed point algebra [formula], generated by the union of the algebras [formula].

The Toeplitz algebra TE can be represented by creation operators [formula] on the Fock bimodule

[formula]

and there is an ideal [formula] in [formula] such that

[formula]

is exact. In particular, if L(E) = K(E) or φ(A)  ⊂  K(E), then

[formula]

For more details about the algebras FE,TE, and OE we refer to the original paper of Pimsner ([\cite=Pi]) and to [\cite=Ka1].

If E is finitely generated, then it has a basis {ui}, in the sense that for all ξ∈E,

[formula]

In this case, L(E) = K(E), and the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra OE is generated by Si = Sui with relations

[formula]

The Toeplitz algebra TE is generated by Ti = Tui which satisfy only the last two relations (see [\cite=KPW]).

1.2 Examples. 1) For [formula] and E = H a Hilbert space with orthonormal basis {ξi}i∈I, the Toeplitz algebra TH is generated by {Si}i∈I satisfying S*iSj  =  δij  ·  1,  i,j∈I. In OH we also have [formula] if the dimension of H is finite. In particular, for [formula] we get [formula], the classical Toeplitz algebra generated by the unilateral shift, [formula], the continuous functions on the unit circle, and [formula]. For [formula], we get [formula], the Cuntz-Toeplitz algebra, [formula], the Cuntz algebra, and [formula]. For H infinite dimensional and separable, [formula].

2) Let E = An with the usual structure:

[formula]

We get [formula].

3) Let α:A  →  A be an automorphism of a unital C*-algebra, and let E = A(α) be the Hilbert bimodule obtained from A with the usual inner product and right multiplication, and with left action φ(a)x = α(a)x. Then TE is isomorphic to the Toeplitz extension Tα used by Pimsner and Voiculescu in [\cite=PV], and OE is isomorphic to the crossed product [formula]. Indeed, let â denote the element in E obtained from a∈A. Then S = τ() is an isometry in any unital Toeplitz representation (τ,π), since 〈,〉 = 1, and it is an unitary in any unital covariant representation, since the rank one operator θ, is the identity. We also have

[formula]

therefore [formula]. In the paper mentioned above, the Toeplitz extension Tα was defined as the C*-subalgebra of [formula] generated by [formula] and [formula], where α(a) = uau* and S+ is the unilateral shift. It is easy to see that [formula] by the map which takes [formula] into a and [formula] into S. Since [formula], we recover the short exact sequence

[formula]

4) Graph C*-algebras. For an oriented countable graph G = (G0,G1,r,s),  C*(G) is defined as the universal C*-algebra generated by mutually orthogonal projections {pv}v∈G0 and partial isometries {se}e∈G1 with orthogonal ranges such that s*ese = pr(e),  ses*e  ≤  ps(e) and

[formula]

We can set A = C0(G0), and denote by E the Hilbert module we obtain after we complete Cc(G1) in the norm given by the inner product

[formula]

with the right action defined by (ξf)(e) = ξ(e)f(r(e)). The left action is defined by

[formula]

We have

[formula]

hence IE = C0({v∈G0:0 < |s- 1(v)| <   ∞  }). Define

[formula]

The pair (τ,π) is a Toeplitz representation into C*(G) iff s*ese = pr(e) and ses*e  ≤  ps(e), which is covariant iff ( * ) is satisfied. This proves that [formula] (see [\cite=Ka1]). The core FE is an AF-algebra. For an irreducible oriented finite graph with no sinks, we obtain the Cuntz-Krieger algebras OA as Cuntz-Pimsner algebras.

5) For a C*-algebra A and an injective unital endomorphism α∈End(A) such that there is a conditional expectation P onto the range α(A), one can define a Hilbert bimodule E = A(α,P), using the transfer operator [formula] as in [\cite=EV]. We complete the vector space A with respect to the inner product 〈ξ,η〉 = L(ξ*η), and define the right and left multiplications by ξ  ·  a = ξα(a),  a  ·  ξ = aξ. We have

[formula]

For α an automorphism and P = id, the corresponding C*-algebra OE is isomorphic to the crossed product [formula]. Indeed, let F be the Hilbert bimodule A(α- 1) with the structure as in example 3. The map α- 1:A  →  A induces an isomorphism of Hilbert bimodules h:E  →  F. For A = C(X) with X compact, and α induced by a surjective local homeomorphism σ:X  →  X, we take

[formula]

where ν(x) is the number of elements in the fiber σ- 1(x). It was proved in [\cite=D] that the corresponding algebra OA(α,P) is isomorphic to C*(Γ(σ)), where Γ(σ) is the Renault groupoid

[formula]

§ 2. EXTENDING THE SCALARS

Let E be a Hilbert module over A and let ρ:A  →  B be a C*-algebra homomorphism (we will be interested mostly in the case when ρ is an inclusion). Then B is a left A-module with multiplication a  ·  b = ρ(a)b, and [formula] becomes a Hilbert module over B, with the inner product given by

[formula]

and right multiplication [formula]. We have [formula], which is strongly Morita equivalent to B in the case E is full. Also, we have an inclusion [formula] for B unital, given by [formula]. If E is a Hilbert bimodule over A, and if there is a *-morphism B  →  L(E) which extends the left multiplication of A on E, then [formula] becomes a Hilbert bimodule over B, and one can form the tensor powers [formula]. Assuming that the left action of B on [formula] is nondegenerate, we get

[formula]

In particular, the Toeplitz algebra [formula] is represented on [formula], and depends on the left multiplication of B. An interesting question is to relate the C*-algebras [formula] and [formula] to TE, OE, and B.

2.1 Example. Let [formula], let E = H be a separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space, and let B be a separable unital C*-algebra. Then [formula] is a Hilbert module over B, and [formula]. If B is faithfully represented on H, then [formula] becomes a Hilbert bimodule over B. Assuming, in addition, that the intersection of B with K(H) is trivial, Kumjian (see [\cite=K]) showed that [formula] is simple and purely infinite, with the same K-theory as B.

2.2 Example. Let A = C0(X) and let E be a Hilbert module given by a continuous field of elementary C*-algebras over X. Then for an abelian C*-algebra B containing C0(X), the tensor product [formula] is obtained by a pull-back. In particular, let (G0,G1,r,s) be a (topological) graph, and consider a covering map p:  →  G0 which gives an inclusion A = C0(G0)  ⊂  C0() = B. The Hilbert module [formula], where E is obtained from Cc(G1) as in example 4 § 1, is associated to a"pull-back graph" in which the set of vertices is [formula] and the set of edges is : = {(x,e,y)∈  ×  G1  ×  |s(e) = p(x),r(e) = p(y)}. The new range and source maps are s(x,e,y) = x,r(x,e,y) = y. It is known that K(E) is isomorphic to C*(R), where R is the equivalence relation

[formula]

Then [formula] is isomorphic to C*(p*(R)), where

[formula]

2.3 Example. Let α:A  →  A be an automorphism of a C*-algebra A, which extends to α̃:B  →  B, where A  ⊂  B. Consider E = A(α) as in example 1.2.3. Then [formula], [formula] and [formula], which contains [formula].

2.4 Example. For a Hilbert bimodule E over A, Pimsner used the Hilbert module [formula] (see [\cite=Pi], section 2) in order to get an inclusion TE  ⊂  TE∞, an isomorphism [formula], and a completely positive map φ:OE  →  TE∞ which is a cross-section to the quotient map TE∞  →  OE.

§ 3. ITERATING THE PIMSNER CONSTRUCTION

Consider now two full finitely generated Hilbert A-bimodules E1 and E2 such that A is unital and the left actions φi:A  →  L(Ei) are injective and nondegenerate. We assume that there is an isomorphism of Hilbert A-bimodules [formula]. This isomorphism should be understood as a kind of commutation relation. The most interesting cases are when E1 and E2 are independent, in the sense that no tensor power of one is isomorphic to the other.

Note that the isomorphism χ induces and isomorphism [formula] because [formula].

Since A  ⊂  TE1, the tensor product [formula] becomes a Hilbert module over TE1 as in § 2, with the inner product given by [formula] and the right multiplication by [formula]. Since TE1 is generated by E1, in order to define a left multiplication of TE1 on [formula], it is sufficient to define the left multiplication by elements in E1. This is done via the composition

[formula]

where the first map is [formula], and the second is given by absorbing E1 into TE1. For the adjoint, note that there is a map

[formula]

where the first map is [formula], and the second is given by left multiplication with the inner product in E1. We will denote by [formula] the bimodule obtained using this left multiplication, when χ is not understood. In the same way, we may consider the bimodule [formula] with the left multiplication induced by χ- 1.

3.1 Lemma. With the above structure, [formula] is a Hilbert bimodule over TE1, and we can consider the Toeplitz algebra [formula]. We have

[formula]

Proof. Both algebras [formula] are represented on the Fock space [formula], and are generated by TE1 and TE2 with the commutation relation given by the isomorphism χ. [formula]

Similarly, we can construct the Hilbert bimodules [formula] and [formula]. We get

3.2 Lemma. With the above notation,

[formula]

Proof. The first two algebras are quotients of [formula] by the ideal generated by [formula], and the last two are quotients by the ideal generated by [formula] and [formula]. [formula]

Note that there is a gauge action of [formula] on [formula].

3.3 Remark. Given E1,E2 as above, we can define a product system E = Eχ of Hilbert bimodules over the semigroup [formula] (see [\cite=F2]), as follows. Define the fibers by [formula] for [formula], and the multiplication induced by the isomorphism χ. It is easy to see that we get associativity, and therefore we may consider the C*-algebras TE,  OE as defined by Fowler. Note that if we change χ, the product system also changes. In particular, a path of isomorphisms χt will determine a family of product systems Et = Eχt.

Recall that a Toeplitz representation of a product system E in a C*-algebra is obtained from a family of Toeplitz representations of the fibers, compatible with the product. In this particular case, it is sufficient to consider two Toeplitz representations (τ1,π),(τ2,π) of the generators E1 and E2, respectively, and to define [formula] for ξi∈E1,i = 1,...,m and ηj∈E2,j = 1,...,n. The Toeplitz algebra TE is represented on the Fock space [formula] by creation operators. The covariance condition requires that each (τi,π) is covariant, i = 1,2. This means that ψi(φi(a)) = π(a) for a∈φ- 1i(K(Ei)),i = 1,2, where ψi(θξ,η) = τi(ξ)τi(η)*. We get that

[formula]

3.4 Example. Let A be a unital C*-algebra, and α,β two commuting automorphisms of A. We assume that α and β generate [formula] as a subgroup of Aut(A). Denote by A(α),A(β) the Hilbert bimodules as in example 1.2.3, which are independent. We have [formula] by the map [formula]. Indeed,

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

Denote by Tα,Tβ the corresponding Toeplitz algebras, each generated by A and an isometry as in example 3, § 1. Then [formula] becomes a Hilbert bimodule over Tα, isomorphic to Tα(β), where β is extended to Tα in the natural way, fixing the isometry. Similarly, [formula]. We have

[formula]

where E is the product system over [formula] constructed from A(α), A(β), and the isomorphism χ. Also, we may consider the Hilbert bimodules [formula], and [formula], where again α and β are extended to [formula] and [formula], respectively, by fixing the unitaries implementing the actions of [formula]. We have

[formula]

[formula]

3.5 Example. Let [formula] with the usual structures of Hilbert bimodules over [formula]. Then [formula], and [formula] becomes a Hilbert module over O2 with the usual operations. The left action will depend on a fixed isomorphism [formula]. If {e1,e2} and {f1,f2} are the canonical bases in E and F respectively, and [formula], then the left multiplication is given by [formula], where O2 has generators {S1,S2}, and [formula]. On the other hand, if [formula], then the left action is given by [formula], and the O2-bimodule [formula] is degenerate. The corresponding Cuntz-Pimsner algebra [formula] is isomorphic to [formula]. Indeed, if we interpret E and F as being each associated to the 1-graph Γ defining O2 (Γ has two edges and one vertex), then the isomorphism χ2 is defining the rank 2 graph φ*(Γ) where [formula] , and the last assertion follows from Example 6.1 and Proposition 2.10 in [\cite=KP].

Note that an arbitrary isomorphism χ does not necessarily define a rank 2 graph. For example, χ could be given by the unitary matrix U = (ukl), where

[formula]

[formula]

for some angles α and β, and the rest of the entries equal to zero. For other C*-algebras defined by a product system of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces over the semigroup [formula], see [\cite=F1].

3.6 Example. Consider two star-commuting onto local homeomorphisms σ1 and σ2 of a compact space X. By definition, that means that for every x,y∈X such that σ1(x) = σ2(y), there exists a unique z∈X such that σ2(z) = x and σ1(z) = y. This condition ensures that the associated conditional expectations P1,P2 commute (see [\cite=ER]). Unfortunately, this condition was omitted in the Proposition on page 8 in [\cite=D2]. I would like to thank Ruy and Jean for pointing this to me.

We can define the Hilbert bimodules Ei = A(αi,Pi),i = 1,2 over A = C(X) as in example 1.2.5. Then there is an isomorphism [formula], given by [formula], with inverse [formula], which induces an isomorphism [formula]. The resulting C*-algebra [formula] can be understood as a crossed product of C(X) by the semigroup [formula]. For other examples of semigroups of local homeomorphisms, see [\cite=ER].

§ 4. EXACT SEQUENCES IN K-THEORY

To study the C*-algebra of Toeplitz operators on the quarter plane, Douglas and Howe (see [\cite=DH]) considered the commutative diagram with exact rows and columns, where j is the inclusion map, and π is the quotient map:

[formula]

4.1 Corollary. We have the short exact sequences

[formula]

[formula]

The above 3  ×  3 diagram and the exact sequences in the corollary are particular cases of a more general situation, for which we provide a proof.

4.2 Lemma. Let A be a C*-algebra and I,J two closed two-sided ideals of A. Then we have the commutative diagram with exact rows and columns, where the maps are the canonical ones:

[formula]

From this we get the exact sequences

[formula]

where [formula], and

[formula]

Applying the K-theory functor, we get

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Proof. Note that the first two rows and the first two columns are obviously exact. For the third row, the map [formula] has kernel [formula]. This defines a map [formula] such that [formula]. By the second isomorphism theorem, [formula], and by the third isomorphism theorem, [formula], hence the third row is exact. The exactness of the third column is proved similarly. Consider now the diagonal morphism [formula]. If a∈ ker π, then [formula], hence there is b∈I with π2(a) = σ1(ω1(b)) = π2(ι1(b)). It follows that a - ι1(b)∈ ker π2  =  ι2(J), and there is c∈J with a = ι1(b) + ι2(c). This gives the first exact sequence. For the second, we use the map [formula] which has kernel [formula]. [formula]

We generalize the above diagram of Douglas and Howe to certain iterated Toeplitz and Cuntz-Pimsner algebras. By the lemma, we get some exact sequences which we hope will help to do K-theory computations in some particular cases.

4.3 Theorem. Consider a C*-algebra A and two finitely generated Hilbert bimodules E1,E2 with a fixed isomorphism [formula]. We assume that [formula] are nondegenerate as Hilbert bimodules, with the structure described in § 3. Then we have the following commuting diagram (depending on χ), with exact rows and columns, where the maps are canonical:

[formula]

Proof. Recall that the algebra TEi is represented on the Fock space [formula] and we have a short exact sequence

[formula]

for i = 1,2. We apply the above lemma for the C*-algebra [formula] with ideals [formula] and [formula]. The nondegeneracy assumption implies that [formula] and [formula]. Note that the map [formula] induces isomorphisms [formula], therefore [formula]. [formula]

4.4 Corollary. Under the same assumptions as in the theorem, we get the short exact sequences

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

The corresponding six-term exact sequences of K-theory give us information about the K-theory of [formula], once we identify the maps between the various K-groups. Note that the Toeplitz algebras are KK-equivalent to the C*-algebra A.

4.5 Example. For α1,α2 two commuting independent automorphisms of a C*-algebra A, the diagram is

[formula]

We get the exact sequences

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

For A = C(X) with X a Cantor set, and σ,τ:X  →  X two commuting local homeomorphisms. Denote by α,β the induced endomorphisms of A, and assume that the associated conditional expectations commute. Applying the theorem for the Hilbert bimodules E = A(α,P), F = A(β,Q) and the canonical isomorphism [formula], we get

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Here we used the fact that [formula] and K1(A) = 0.

4.6 Example. Let [formula] and fix [formula] an isomorphism. The corresponding diagram (depending on χ) is

[formula]

The exact sequences (depending on χ) are

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

In particular, if χ is just the flip, we have

[formula]

[formula]

and we recover the K-theory of [formula].

4.7 Example. Let [formula] and σi(x) = xpi,i = 1,2 with p1,p2 relatively prime. Then the associated conditional expectations commute, and using the K-theory computations in [\cite=D1], we get

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

More generally, we may consider coverings of the n-torus [formula].
