Eigenvalues of the transversal Dirac Operator on Kähler Foliations

Introduction

On a compact Riemannian spin manifold (Mn,gM), Th. Friedrich [\cite=F] showed that any eigenvalue λ of the Dirac operator satisfies

[formula]

where S0 denotes the infimum of the scalar curvature of M. The limiting case in ([\ref=eq:100]) is characterized by the existence of a Killing spinor. As a consequence M is Einstein. K.D. Kirchberg [\cite=K] established that, on such manifolds any eigenvalue λ satisfies the inequalities

[formula]

On a compact Riemannian spin foliation (M,gM,F) of codimension q with a bundle-like metric gM such that the mean curvature κ is a basic coclosed 1-form, S.D. Jung [\cite=j1] showed that any eigenvalue λ of the transversal Dirac operator satisfies

[formula]

where [formula] here [formula] denotes the transversal scalar curvature with the transversal Levi-Civita connection [formula] The limiting case in ([\ref=eq:569]) is characterized by the fact that F is minimal (κ = 0) and transversally Einstein (see Theorem [\ref=thm:002]). The main result of this paper is the following:

Let (M,gM,F) be a compact Riemannian manifold with a Kähler spin foliation F of codimension q = 2m and a bundle-like metric gM. Assume that κ is a basic coclosed 1-form, then any eigenvalue λ of the transversal Dirac operator satisfies:

[formula]

and

[formula]

The limiting case in [\eqref=eq:12] is characterised by the fact that the foliation is minimal and by existence of a transversal Kählerian Killing spinor (see Theorem [\ref=thm:08]). We refer to Theorem [\ref=thm:005] for the equality case in [\eqref=eq:13]. We point out that Inequality [\eqref=eq:12] was proved by S. D. Jung [\cite=j2] with the additional assumption that κ is transversally holomorphic. The author would like to thank Oussama Hijazi for his support.

Foliated manifolds

In this section, we summarize some standard facts about foliations. For more details, we refer to [\cite=p], [\cite=j1]. Let (M,gM) be a (p + q)-dimensional Riemannian manifold and a foliation F of codimension q and let [formula] be the Levi-civita connection associated with gM. We consider the exact sequence where L is the tangent bundle of TM and [formula] the normal bundle. We assume gM to be a bundle-like metric on Q, that means the induced metric gQ verifies the holonomy invariance condition, where LX is the Lie derivative with respect to X. Let [formula] be the connection on Q defined by: where s∈Γ(Q) and Ys is the unique vector of [formula] such that [formula] The connection [formula] is metric and torsion-free. The curvature of [formula] acts on Γ(Q) by :

[formula]

The transversal Ricci curvature is defined by:

[formula]

ρΓ(Q)Γ(Q)Xρ(X)= R(X,e)e. Also, we define the transversal scalar curvature : where [formula] is a local orthonormal frame of Q and [formula] for all X,Y,Z,W∈Γ(Q). The foliation F is said to be transversally Einstein if and only if with constant transversal scalar curvature. The mean curvature of Q is given by: where [formula] with [formula] is a local orthonormal frame of Γ(L) and II is the second fundamental form of F defined by:

[formula]

IIΓ(L) × Γ(L) Γ(Q)(X,Y)II (X,Y)=π ( Y). We define basic r-forms by :

[formula]

where d is the exterior derivative and [formula] is the interior product. Any Φ∈ΩrB(F) can be locally written as where [formula] With the local expression of basic r-forms, one can verify that κ is closed if F is isoparametric ([formula]). For all r  ≥  0, We denote by [formula] where [formula] is the tensor algebra of [formula] We have the following formulas: where δB is the adjoint operator of dB with respect to the induced scalar product and [formula] is a local orthonormal frame of Q.

The transversal Dirac operator on Kähler Foliations

In this section, we start by recalling some facts on Riemannian foliations which could be found in [\cite=gk1], [\cite=gk2], [\cite=ag], [\cite=j1]. For completeness, we also scketch a straightforward proof of Inequality ([\eqref=eq:569]) established in [\cite=j1] and end by recalling well-known facts (see [\cite=K], [\cite=D], [\cite=h1], [\cite=h2], [\cite=j2]) on Kähler spin foliations.

On a foliated Riemannian manifold [formula] a transversal spin structure is a pair [formula] where [formula] is a [formula]-principal fibre bundle over M and η a 2-fold cover such that the following diagram commutes:

[formula]

The maps [formula] and [formula] are respectively the actions of [formula] and [formula] on the principal fibre bundles [formula] and [formula]. In this case, F is called a transversal spin foliation. We define the foliated spinor bundle by: [formula] where [formula] is the complex spin representation and Σq is a [formula] vector space of dimension N with [formula] where

[formula]

DΨ = Ψ +KΨ,

[formula]

Ψ =- Ψ + Ψ,

Eigenvalues of the transversal Dirac operator

In this section, we prove Kirchberg-type inequalities by using the transversal Kählerian twistor operators on Kähler spin foliations. We refer to [\cite=k2], [\cite=k1].

On a Kähler spin foliation, we define the transversal Kählerian twistor operators by where Mr is the transversal Clifford multiplication defined by

[formula]

For all [formula] and Ψr∈Γ(Sr(F)), we have

[formula]

where [formula] For any spinor field Ψr∈Γ(Sr(F)), we can easily prove

[formula]

Proof. Let φ be an eigenspinor of Dtr. There exists an r such that φr does not vanish. Let [formula] one can easily get that DtrΨ  =  λΨ.

Let [formula] be a compact Riemannian manifold with a Kähler spin foliation F of codimension q = 2m and a bundle-like metric gM with κ∈Ω1B(F) and δBκ = 0. Then any eigenvalue λ of the transversal Dirac operator, satisfies

[formula]

If Ψ is an eigenspinor of type (r,r + 1) associated with an eigenvalue λ satisfying equality in [\eqref=eq:02], then [formula] the foliation F is minimal and for all X∈Γ(Q), the spinor Ψ satisfies

[formula]

where [formula] and : = ( - 1)r(Ψr  -  Ψr + 1). As a consequence m is odd and F is transversally Einstein with non negative constant transversal curvature [formula]

Proof. For all Ψr∈Γ(Sr(F)), using Identities [\eqref=eq:111] and [\eqref=eq:120], we have

[formula]

Finally we obtain,

[formula]

Let λ be an eigenvalue of Dtr and let Ψ an eigenspinor of type (r,r + 1). Applying Equality [\eqref=eq:60] to Ψr, one gets

[formula]

By the Schrödinger-Lichnerowicz formula and by the fact that Ψr and Ψr + 1 have the same L2-norms, we get

[formula]

Similarly applying [\eqref=eq:60] to Ψr + 1, we obtain

[formula]

where [formula] In order to get rid the term [formula] since the l.h.s. of [\eqref=eq:4567] and [\eqref=eq:4568] are non negative, dividing [\eqref=eq:4567] by ar and [\eqref=eq:4568] by br + 1 then summing up, we find by substituting the values of ar and br + 1, Now, we discuss the limiting case of Inequality [\eqref=eq:02]. Dividing [\eqref=eq:4567] by ar and [\eqref=eq:4568] by br + 1 then summing up as before, and substituting ar, br + 1 and λ2 by their values, we easily deduce that κ = 0, P(r)Ψr = 0 and P(r + 1)Ψr + 1 = 0. Hence by [\eqref=eq:4567], we find that [formula] where [formula] then [formula] and m is odd. It remains to prove that Ψ satisfies [\eqref=eq:06]. For [formula] by definition of the Kählerian twistor operators, for all [formula] we obtain and Summing up the two equations, we get [\eqref=eq:06] for X = ej. Using Ricci identity in [\eqref=eq:06], one easily proves that F is transversally Einstein. [formula]

Under the same conditions as in Theorem [\ref=thm:08] for m even, any eigenvalue λ of the transversal Dirac operator satisfies

[formula]

If Ψ is an eigenspinor of type (r,r + 1) associated with an eigenvalue satisfying equality in [\eqref=eq:554], then [formula] the foliation F is minimal and Ψ satisfies for all X∈Γ(Q),

[formula]

Proof. Let Ψ an eigenspinor of type (r,r + 1) associated with any eigenvalue λ of the transversal Dirac operator Dtr. Recalling Equalities [\eqref=eq:4567] and [\eqref=eq:4568], we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Hence if [formula], then by [\eqref=eq:556] The antilinear isomorphism j sends Sr(F) to Sm - r(F). This allows the choice of μr to be non negative (i.e. [formula]) where μr is the eigenvalue associated with Ψr. Then a careful study of the graph of the function [formula] yields [\eqref=eq:554]. On the other hand if [formula] Applying Equation ([\ref=eq:60]) to the spinor jΨ, which is a spinor of type (m - (r + 1),m - r), we find the same inequalities as [\eqref=eq:555] and [\eqref=eq:556], then As before we can choose μm - (r + 1)  ≥  0 (i.e. [formula]). A careful study of the graph of the function [formula] gives Inequality [\eqref=eq:554]. Now we discuss the limiting case of [\eqref=eq:554]. As we have seen, it could not be achieved if [formula] so only the other case should be considered. By [\eqref=eq:4568], one has

[formula]

Since [formula] and the l.h.s. of [\eqref=eq:002] is non negative, we deduce that κ = 0,Pr + 1Ψr + 1 = 0 and [formula] so [formula] It remains to show that Equation [\eqref=eq:008] holds. For this, take X = ej where [formula] is a local orthonormal frame. For [formula] and by definition of the Kählerian twistor operators, for all [formula], we obtain [formula]
