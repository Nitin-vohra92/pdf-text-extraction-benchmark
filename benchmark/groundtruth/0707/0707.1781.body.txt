Calculation of the metric in the Hilbert space of a [formula]-symmetric model via the spectral theorem

12 July 2007

Introduction

Although quantum mechanic is conceptually a self-adjoint theory, there are numbers of problems that require the analysis of non-self-adjoint operators. The study of resonances of self-adjoint Schrödinger operators via the technique of complex scaling [\cite=CFKS] or the derivation of the famous Landau-Zener formula for the adiabatic transition probability between eigenstates of a time-dependent two-level system [\cite=Joye-Kunz-Pfister_1991] are just two examples. However, in contrast to the well understood theory of self-adjoint operators, the non-self-adjoint theory can be quite different (cf a nice review [\cite=Davies_2002]) and is certainly less developed. The former is much easier to analyse because of the existence of the spectral theorem.

Recent years brought new motivations and focused attention to aspects of problems which attracted little attention earlier. A strong impetus comes from the so-called [formula]-symmetric quantum mechanics, where the Hamiltonian H of a system is not Hermitian but the Schrödinger equation is invariant under a simultaneous change of spatial reflection P and time reversal T (cf [\cite=Bender-Boettcher_1998] for the pioneering work and [\cite=Bender_2007] for a recent review with many references). Here the interest consists in the fact that many of the [formula]-symmetric Hamiltonians possess real spectra and that the problem can be reinterpreted as a Hermitian one in a different Hilbert space. Indeed, and more generally, the identification is provided by the pseudo-Hermiticity relation [\cite=GHS] [\cite=Ali1] [\cite=Ali2] [\cite=Ali3]:

[formula]

valid on the domain of H. Here Θ is a bounded positive Hermitian operator, called metric.

There have been many attempts to calculate the metric operator Θ for the various [formula]-symmetric models of interest (cf [\cite=KBZ] for the related references to which we add the Swanson model [\cite=Swanson_2004] [\cite=Geyer-Scholtz-Snyman_2004] [\cite=Jones_2005] and recent works [\cite=Ali5.5] [\cite=Ali6]). Because of the complexity of the problem, however, it is not surprising that most of the available formulae for Θ are just approximative, usually expressed as leading terms of perturbation series. Moreover, the calculations are usually formal in the sense that the boundedness of Θ is not verified (cf [\cite=Kretschmer-Szymanowski_2004] for a rigorous discussion on the importance of the boundedness).

For these reasons we decided in [\cite=KBZ] to introduce a new one-parametric non-Hermitian [formula]-symmetric Hamiltonian Hα with real spectrum - which very likely represents the simplest possible [formula]-symmetric model whatsoever - and derived a formula for its metric Θα in a closed form and in a rigorous manner. The method of [\cite=KBZ] relied on the fact that the eigenfunctions of Hα can be expressed in terms of eigenfunctions of self-adjoint operators. Using the completeness of the latter, the metric operator was constructed by summing up certain series of trigonometric functions.

The ultimate objective of this note is to point out that the series determining Θα can be summed up alternatively - and probably more elegantly - by using the spectral theorem. Moreover, we believe that the resulting formula for the metric has a more transparent structure than that presented in [\cite=KBZ] and might be useful for further applications of the pseudo-Hermiticity of our model.

For the convenience of the reader we state here a simple version of the spectral theorem we shall use later:

Let H be a self-adjoint operator with compact resolvent in a Hilbert space with inner product (  ·  ,  ·  ), antilinear in the first factor and linear in the second one. Then

[formula]

for any complex-valued, continuous function f. Here {Ej}∞j = 0 and {ψj}∞j = 0 denote respectively the set of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of H.

We refer to [\cite=Kato] for a proof and a more general version of the spectral theorem when the compactness assumption is relaxed. Similar spectral decompositions hold also for normal operators, but they are in general false in the non-self-adjoint theory. Therefore it is remarkable that a modified version of [\eqref=decomposition] with f(E) = En, [formula], still holds for our non-Hermitian operator Hα (cf [\cite=KBZ] for the case n = 0, the other cases being a consequence).

The spectral theorem is usually used to construct a function of a self-adjoint operator in terms of the sum of spectral projections. In this note we use it backwards: we identify eigenprojections of a self-adjoint operator and replace an infinite series by a function of the operator.

In the forthcoming Section [\ref=Sec.model] we recall the model introduced in [\cite=KBZ] (we refer to that reference for more details and other results). This is followed by Section [\ref=Sec.metric] where the alternative formula for the metric is established.

The model

The simplicity of the Hamiltonian Hα consists in that it acts as the free Hamiltonian

[formula]

while the non-Hermiticity enters uniquely through complex Robin boundary conditions:

[formula]

where α is a real constant. It was shown in [\cite=KBZ] that Hα, with the domain D(Hα) consisting of all functions ψ in the Sobolev space W2,2((0,d)) such that [\eqref=bc] holds, is an m-sectorial operator in H: = L2((0,d)). The [formula]-symmetry of our model is reflected by the relation

[formula]

A more general class of one-dimensional Schrödinger operators with non-Hermitian boundary conditions of the type [\eqref=bc] was studied previously by Kaiser, Neidhardt and Rehberg in [\cite=Kaiser-Neidhardt-Rehberg_2003]. In their paper, motivated by the needs of semiconductor physics, the parameter α is allowed to be complex but its imaginary part has opposite signs on the boundary points such that the system is dissipative.

It was also shown in [\cite=KBZ] that the spectrum of Hα is purely discrete and given by

[formula]

Moreover, all the eigenvalues are simple provided

[formula]

Assuming this non-degeneracy condition, the eigenfunctions of the adjoint H*α corresponding to the eigenvalues counted as in [\eqref=spectrum] can be chosen as

[formula]

Here

[formula]

and {χNj}∞j = 0, respectively {χDj}∞j = 1, denotes the complete orthonormal family of the eigenfunctions of the Neumann Laplacian -  ΔN, respectively Dirichlet Laplacian -  ΔD, in H: Note that -  ΔN = H0 and that the spectrum of -  ΔD is equal to {k2j}∞j = 1.

Calculation of the metric

Still under the hypothesis [\eqref=hypothesis], it was demonstrated in [\cite=KBZ] that the operator

[formula]

is bounded, symmetric, positive and satisfying ([\ref=pseudo.Hermiticity]) with Hα. Here (  ·  ,  ·  ) denotes the inner product in H, antilinear in the first factor and linear in the second one. Furthermore, a closed integral-type formula for the operator was derived by using known results about the sum of trigonometric functions.

Now we propose an alternative way how to sum up the infinite series in [\eqref=metric]. First we write Θα as

[formula]

with

[formula]

where PN0: = χN0(χN0,  ·  ) = P00 and I denotes the identity operator in H. The equalities in the second and fourth lines follow directly by Theorem [\ref=ST] applied to -  ΔN and -  ΔD, respectively. In order to use the spectral theorem in Θ(1) as well, we introduce a "momentum" operator p in H by

[formula]

The adjoint operator p* acts in the same way but has a larger domain, D(p*) = W1,2((0,d)). Since χDj and χNj belong to D(p) and D(p*), respectively, we have pχDj =  - ikjχNj and p*χNj = ikjχDj. Consequently, Theorem [\ref=ST] yields

[formula]

where [formula]. Notice that the "interchange of summation and differentiation" in the first equality is justified just by the definition of the sum in [\eqref=metric] and the distributional derivative in [\eqref=momentum].

Summing up, we get

The linear operator Θα in H defined by

[formula]

is bounded, symmetric, non-negative and satisfies [\eqref=pseudo.Hermiticity] with Hα. Furthermore, Θα is positive if the condition [\eqref=hypothesis] holds true.

Note that the metric Θα tends to I as α  →  0, which is expected due to the fact that H0 coincides with the self-adjoint operator -  ΔN.

Formula [\eqref=result] can be written exclusively in terms of the operators p and p* by employing the identities -  ΔD = p*p and -  ΔN = pp*. Note also that the resolvent ( - ΔD)- 1 and the reduced resolvent [formula] are integral operators with explicit and extremely simple kernels (cf [\cite=Kato]).
