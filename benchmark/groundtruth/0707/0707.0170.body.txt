Introduction

Quantum error correction is one of the main directions in the developing of the quantum information theory since middle of the 1990, see [\cite=Shor]- [\cite=KL]. Recently in series of papers [\cite=CKZ] - [\cite=CHKZ] it was introduced one approach to the realization of error-correcting codes for quantum channels. Results of [\cite=CKZ] - [\cite=CHKZ] give the possibility to reduce the realization of the correctable codes to the matrix analysis problem, namely, to the study of the "higher-rank numerical range" of the operators related to the "error operator" of the quantum channel. The "higher-rank numerical range" is a generalization of the usual notion of the operator spectrum. Namely, let [formula] be a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, [formula] be a set of operators acting on [formula], σ∈. For k  ≥  1 the rank-k numerical range of σ is the subset of complex plane [formula] for some k-dimensional orthogonal projections P on [formula]. The key problem is a description of Λk(σ) for a given operator σ in explicit terms. The next statement was proved in [\cite=CHKZ].

Proposition 1. Let [formula] be an N - dimensional Hilbert space, k  ≥  1 be a positive integer, σ be a normal matrix, then

[formula]

where

[formula]

and Γ runs through all (N - k + 1) - point subsets (counting multiplicities) of the set of eigenvalues spec(σ) for σ, conv(Γ) means the convex hulls of the set Γ.

It was conjectured in [\cite=CKZ], that the conversion of this statement is valid.

Conjecture. For the normal matrix σ

[formula]

For the brevity we will denote Conjecture for given N,k as (N,k). This statement is not proved in general case, some particular cases were discussed in [\cite=CHKZ]. In particular, the next propositions were checked in [\cite=CHKZ]

Proposition 2. Conjecture holds if and only if the corresponding statement holds for all unitary matrices.

Proposition 3. Conjecture ([\ref=ff2]) is valid for N  ≥  3k, k  ≥  2, (5,2), (8,3), and, generally, (3k - 1,k),k  ≥  2.

Conjecture (N,k),N  ≥  3k, was verified in [\cite=CHKZ] explicitly. The corresponding construction was presented with help of simple and elementary terms, see discussion below. However, the verification of the Conjecture (5,2), (8,3), and (3k - 1,k) was given [\cite=CHKZ] non-constructively. But at the realization of the quantum error-correcting codes it is necessary to get an explicit description of the corresponding objects, such as projector P. Note, that full proof of the Conjecture was obtained in [\cite=LS] with help of more advanced technique.

The aim of this note is to modify an elementary approach of the [\cite=CHKZ] and to suggest a constructive verification of the Conjecture (3k - 1,k),k  ≥  2 and (3k - 2,k),k  ≥  5. We will consider here the mathematical details only, initial motivation and discussion of possible applications in the theory of quantum error-correcting codes can be found in [\cite=CKZ] - [\cite=CHKZ].

General considerations

As it follows from Proposition 2, we can discuss a unitary matrix σ, so its spectrum belongs to the unit circle. Let eigenvalues of σ are [formula] j = 1,2,...,N, such that 0  ≤  θ1  ≤  θ2  ≤  ...θN < 2π. We extend the numbering of the λj and |ψj  >   cyclically if it is necessary. For multiple eigenvalues the numbering is arbitrary, and we choose an orthonormal system of eigenvectors |ψj  >  ∈,

[formula]

Let [formula], it means, that k-dimensional orthogonal projection P exist, for which

[formula]

Let

[formula]

for some set of orthonormal vectors [formula] and

[formula]

then normalization means, that

[formula]

and orthogonality means, that

[formula]

Relation ([\ref=kl1]) reads in our notations:

[formula]

For the convenience of following discussions we formulate the inversion of these considerations as a proposition.

Proposition 4. If for given λ we can find a set of vectors [formula] which satisfy relations ([\ref=kl21])- ([\ref=kl4]), then [formula] and corresponding projector P is described by relation ([\ref=kl2]) .

First of all we cite here one more result of [\cite=CHKZ] which is useful in what follows.

Proposition 5. Given integers i,j with i < j < i + N, let D(i,j) denote the convex subset of [formula] bounded by the line segment from λi to λj and the counterclockwise circular arc from λj to λi. Then

[formula]

The next simple result which will be exploited below follows from Proposition 5.

Corollary. Let T(λi,λj,λm), i < j < m, is a triangle with vertexes [formula]. If |j - i| < k,|m - j| < k,|N + i - m| < k, then Ωk(σ)  ⊂  T(λi,λj,λm), so for any λ∈Ωk(σ) exist nonnegative numbers pi,pj,pm, for which the following relations are valid:

[formula]

[formula]

Note, that these relations are a special case of relations ([\ref=kl31]) and ([\ref=kl4]). We will associate with such triangle a normalized vector

[formula]

As was mentioned above, Conjecture (N,k),N  ≥  3k, was proved in [\cite=CHKZ]. Namely, corresponding procedure includes a construction of k triangles satisfying conditions of Corollary. These triangles have not common vertexes, so corresponding vectors ([\ref=vect]) are orthogonal each other. Full set of these vectors satisfy Proposition 4.

Here we present some modification of an elementary approach [\cite=CHKZ]. Namely, we use a set of k triangles too, but we permit existence of common vertex either for one pair of triangles (Conjecture ((3k - 1),k) or for two pairs of triangles (Conjecture ((3k - 2),k). The key result in our considerations is the following statement.

Proposition 6. Let we have two set of numbers pt,qr  ≥  0, [formula] [formula] [formula] which satisfy the next conditions:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

If either p1  ≤  1 / 2 or q1  ≤  1 / 2, then there are two orthonormal vectors

[formula]

[formula]

satisfying relations ([\ref=kl31])-([\ref=kl4]).

Proof. Let

[formula]

[formula]

Simple calculations with help of ([\ref=n1])-([\ref=res2]) confirm, that relations ([\ref=kl31]) and ([\ref=kl4]) are valid for these vectors. We have to find values θ,τ,α,β in order to get orthogonality of vectors |φ1 > ,|φ2  >  . We obtain the following condition:

[formula]

[formula]

here we take into account relations ([\ref=n1]) and ([\ref=n2]). Let x =  tan θ,y =  tan τ. Separating real and imaginary parts of the last expression, one can get the following pair of equations:

[formula]

[formula]

Excluding y, we obtain quadratic equation for x:

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=res9]) has real root, if the next condition holds:

[formula]

or, in more details,

[formula]

[formula]

Note, that if either p1  ≤  1 / 2 or q1  ≤  1 / 2 we can get non-positive right-hand side of the last expression by the corresponding choice of the parameters α,β. Then condition ([\ref=res12]) holds, we can calculate corresponding (real) values x,y or, in other words, θ,τ and construct the pair of orthonormal vectors |φ1 > ,|φ2  >   in explicit terms. The result follows.

Definition . Let [formula], and for given λ

[formula]

[formula]

and pt1  ≤  1 / 2. We call the point [formula] weak vertex of the polygon generated by T.

In what follows we will construct k triangles [formula], each of them will satisfy condition of the Corollary. Note, that each such triangle contains two weak vertexes. For the Conjecture (3k - 1,k) only one pair of triangles (only two pairs for the Conjecture (3k - 2,k)) will have one common vertex, weak for one of triangles. So, we can apply Proposition 6 and get a pair of necessary vectors |φ1 > ,|φ2  >   (two pairs for Conjecture (3k - 2,k), respectively). For the remaining (k - 2) ((k - 4) for Conjecture (3k - 2,k)) triangles corresponding vectors will be defined by relation ([\ref=vect]). These vectors will be normalized and orthogonal each other, and this set of vectors will satisfy conditions ([\ref=kl31])-([\ref=kl4]).

Constructive verification of the Conjecture (3k - 1,k).

So, our aim is to find a necessary system of triangles. In order to clarify details, we firstly consider N = 5,k = 2. The spectrum of the unitary operator σ is depicted on figure 1. Note, that some eigenvalues can coincide, but we represent them as different points for more clearness. Let λ∈Ω2(σ). In accordance with Proposition 2,

[formula]

As a first triangle, appearing in Proposition 6, we take [formula] . Note, that either vertex [formula] or vertex [formula] is weak vertex of this triangle. In the first case we take [formula] as a second triangle appearing in Proposition 6. In this case [formula] If the vertex [formula] is weak vertex of triangle [formula], we take [formula] as a second triangle, [formula]. In both situations intersection of chosen triangles contains only one vertex, which is weak for triangle [formula] and we can apply Proposition 6. Then we obtain the pair of vectors satisfying relations ([\ref=kl31])-([\ref=kl4]).

As the second example we consider N = 3k - 1,k  ≥  3. The spectrum in this situation is depicted on figure 2. If λ∈Ωk(σ), then, in accordance with Corollary, λ belongs to the triangle [formula] In that triangle either vertex [formula] or [formula] is weak one. Let, for distinctness, it is [formula] (there is a symmetry of the picture). Then we take as the second triangle [formula]. The remaining (k - 2) triangles are [formula] etc. As follows from the Corollary, Ωk(σ) belongs to intersection of all triangles. Note, that only triangles [formula] [formula] have one common vertex (which is weak for the first triangle). Applying Proposition 6 to the triangles [formula] [formula], we can construct a pair of orthogonal vectors |φk > ,|φk - 1  >  , which satisfy conditions ([\ref=kl31]), ([\ref=kl4]). For each triangle [formula] we take associated by ([\ref=vect]) vectors,

[formula]

where positive numbers pk - m,p2k - m,p3k - m - 1 are determined by relation

[formula]

As was mentioned above, vectors [formula] are orthogonal each other. So, we have constructed the necessary set of vectors and the corresponding orthogonal projector is given by relation ([\ref=kl2]).

Note, that correctness of Conjecture ((3k - 1)m,km), m  ≥  2 follows immediately from our results.

Constructive verification of the Conjecture (3k - 2,k).

Now we consider Conjecture (3k - 2,k),k  ≥  5. In order to verify this situation we have twice apply Proposition 6 .

For the convenience we begin from Conjecture (13,5) (see figure 3) . First of all we depict the triangle [formula]. In this triangle either [formula] or [formula] is a weak vertex. There is an evident symmetry of our figure on this stage, and we choose vertex [formula]. Then next triangle will be [formula], which has one common vertex with triangle [formula]. With help of Proposition 6 we can construct two orthonormal vectors |φ1 > ,|φ2 > , satisfying relations ([\ref=kl31])-([\ref=kl4]). As the next triangle we choose [formula], where either [formula] or [formula] is a weak vertex.

1) Let [formula] is the weak vertex of the triangle [formula]. Then we take triangle [formula] and for pair of triangles [formula] we construct with help of Proposition 6 the pair of orthogonal vectors |φ3 > ,|φ4 > , satisfying relations ([\ref=kl31])-([\ref=kl4]). Residuary vertexes gives us the last triangle [formula], which generates the fifth necessary vector in accordance with ([\ref=vect]).

2) Let [formula] is the weak vertex of the triangle [formula]. Then we choose triangle [formula] and for pair of triangles [formula] we construct with help of Proposition 6 the pair of orthogonal vectors |φ3 > ,|φ4 > , satisfying relations ([\ref=kl31])-([\ref=kl4]). Residuary vertexes gives us the last triangle [formula] and we obtain the fifth vector, associated with this triangle by ([\ref=vect]).

Let now consider Conjecture (3k - 2,k) for k > 5, see figure 4. First triangle is triangle [formula], and either [formula] or [formula] is a weak vertex. Due to symmetry we can choose any of them, and we choose [formula]. The next triangle is [formula], which has one common vertex with [formula]. So, proposition 6 gives the possibility to construct a pair vectors |φ1 > ,|φ2  >   with necessary properties. Then we choose triangle [formula]. Here either [formula] or [formula] is a weak vertex.

1) Let [formula] is a weak vertex. Then we choose as a next triangle [formula]. With help of Proposition 6 we construct one more pair of vectors |φ3 > ,|φ4  >   with necessary properties. The triangle [formula] gives the fifth vector |φ5  >  . Additional (k - 5) vectors can be constructed with help of k - 5 triangles [formula] Each such triangle satisfies condition of Corollary and relation ([\ref=vect]) gives us corresponding vector.

2) Let now [formula] is a weak vertex. As a next triangle we choose [formula]. Applying Proposition 6 we construct one more pair of vectors |φ3 > ,|φ4  >   with necessary properties. The triangle [formula] gives us the fifth vector |φ5  >  . Additional (k - 5) vectors can be constructed with help of (k - 5) triangles [formula] and relation ([\ref=vect]).

Evidently, that Conjecture ((3k - 2)s,ks),k  ≥  5,s = 2,3,..., follows from this result.

Conclusion

We have discussed the "higher-rank numerical ranges" method of constructing error-correcting codes for quantum channels. The realization of the correctable codes is reduced in this framework to the matrix analysis problem, which was thoroughly considered in papers [\cite=CKZ] - [\cite=CHKZ] and solved in [\cite=LS]. Realization of the error-correcting codes is based on explicit description of higher-rank numerical ranges of operators related to the error operators. Corresponding constructive description was obtained in [\cite=CHKZ] for N  ≥  3k in elementary terms. Here we have presented some modification of this construction, which can be applied for N = 3k - 1,k  ≥  2 and N = 3k - 2,k  ≥  5. These results can be useful at constructing error-correcting codes for a special classes of quantum channels CHKZ.
