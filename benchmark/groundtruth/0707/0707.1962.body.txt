Some further remarks on good sets

Introduction and preliminaries

The purpose of this note is to answer two questions about good sets raised in [\cite=3] and [\cite=4].

Let [formula] be nonempty sets and let [formula] be their cartesian product. We will write [formula] to denote a point [formula]. For each 1  ≤  i  ≤  n,Πi denotes the canonical projection of Ω onto Xi.

A subset S  ⊂  Ω is said to be good, if every complex-valued function f on S is of the form:

[formula]

for suitable functions [formula] on [formula] respectively ([\cite=3], p. 181).

For a good set S, a subset [formula] is said to be a boundary set of S, if for any complex-valued function U on B and for any [formula], eq. (1) subject to

[formula]

admits a unique solution. For a good set there always exists a boundary set ([\cite=3], p. 187).

A subset S  ⊂  Ω is said to be full, if S is a maximal good set in [formula].

A set S  ⊂  Ω is full if and only if it has a boundary consisting of n - 1 points ([\cite=3], Theorem 3, page 185).

If a set S is good, maximal full subsets of S form a partition of S. They are called full components of S ([\cite=3], p. 183).

Two points [formula] in a good set S are said to be related, denoted by [formula], if there exists a finite subset of S which is full and contains both [formula] and [formula]. R is an equivalence relation, whose equivalence classes are called related components of S. The related components of S are full subsets of S (ref. [\cite=3]).

Example of a full set which is not related

For a good set in two dimensions, full components are same as related components and are called linked components ([\cite=2], p. 60). In p. 190 of [\cite=3], the question whether full components are the same as related components for n  ≥  3, is raised. Theorem 1 of [\cite=5] answers the question partially, where it is proved that a full set with finitely many related components is itself related.

Here we prove that when the dimension n is ≥  4, a full component need not be a related component, by giving an example of a full set with infinitely many related components.

Our example, in a four-fold cartesian product, will consist of countable number of points [formula] such that for each n the subset Sn of first n points of this set will be a good set and have a boundary consisting of four or five points depending on whether n is even or odd. Moreover, any boundary of Sn will necessarily contain two or one point from the coordinates of [formula], depending on whether n is odd or even, so that eventually these points of the boundary disappear and S will have boundary with only three points. So S will be full. On the other hand, S will have related components consisting of single points.

Let [formula] be a set of distinct symbols. The jth term of this sequence will be called the jth symbol. Then xi will be ith symbol, 1  ≤  i  ≤  4, while αj will be the (j + 4)th symbol for j  ≥  1.

The countable infinite set S in four dimensions is defined as [formula], where

[formula]

and so on. In general, for n  ≥  2,

[formula]

We prove that this set is full and singletons are its related components.

Let [formula] Consider the matrix Mn corresponding to the set Sn, called the matrix of Sn (p. 58 of [\cite=2]), whose rows correspond to the points [formula], 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, and whose columns correspond to the symbols occurring in the points of Sn. The ijth entry of this matrix is 1, if the jth symbol occurs in the point [formula]. Otherwise, the ijth entry is 0.

If n is odd, say n = 2m - 1, then M2m - 1 consists of 2m - 1 rows and 2m + 4 columns corresponding to the symbols [formula] If n is even, n = 2m, then there are 2m rows and 2m + 4 columns corresponding to {x1,x2,x3,x4, [formula] in M2m. The matrix of S is defined similarly.

We will prove by induction that for each n, S2n is a good set and has boundary {x1,x2,x3, α2n} (or {x1,x2,x3,α2n - 1}). Clearly the statement holds for n = 1. Assume that the statement holds for n = m - 1. We have to show that the statement holds for n = m.

Since S2m - 2 is good and has a boundary consisting of {x1,x2,x3,α2m - 2} it is clear that S2m - 1 is also good and has a boundary consisting of {x1,x2,x3,α2m - 1,α2m}. (Note that [formula] has two new coordinates α2m - 1 and α2m not occurring in [formula]). For any f on S2m - 1, a solution u1,u2,u3,u4 satisfying

[formula]

is uniquely determined once we fix the values of ui, 1  ≤  i  ≤  4, on the boundary points.

We drop the columns corresponding to the symbols x1,x2,x3,α2m - 1,α2m from M2m - 1 and get an invertible (2m - 1)  ×  (2m - 1)-matrix N2m - 1 with entries zeros and ones given below: To show that S2m is good and has a boundary consisting of {x1,x2,x3,α2m}, consider the matrix of S2m.

If we drop from the matrix M2m the columns corresponding to x1,x2,x3,α2m, we get a 2m  ×  2m-matrix given below. Its initial (2m - 1)  ×  (2m - 1) matrix is the matrix N2m - 1 obtained above which is invertible, and hence has its rows linearly independent. It is clear from this that rows of N2m are also linearly independent, so that N2m is invertible. This proves that S2m is good and {x1,x2,x3,α2m} is its boundary. We can see similarly that {x1,x2,x3,α2m - 1} is also a boundary for S2m.

We now prove that {x1,x2,x3,α2m} (or {x1,x2,x3,α2m - 1}) is not a boundary of S2n for any m < n. Indeed, if {x1,x2,x3,α2m} is a boundary of S2n for some m < n, then for any f on S2m + 2 there is a solution u1,u2,u3,u4 of

[formula]

where values of u1,u2,u3 and an appropriate ui are preassigned on x1,x2,x3,α2m respectively.

Since {x1,x2,x3,α2m} is a boundary of S2m, u4(x4) and the value of appropriate ui is determined on α2m - 1 by the values of the function on the points of S2m.

Now if [formula], then

[formula]

which clearly do not hold together if The case [formula] can be treated similarly and we see that the set {x1,x2,x3,α2m} cannot be a boundary of S2n for n > m. The case of {x1,x2,x3,α2m - 1} is similar. The set S is good because every finite subset of it is good. To show that it is full it is enough to show that any boundary B of S consists of three points. Take a function f on S and fix the values of ui on [formula]. Then there exists a unique solution ui on ΠiS, i = 1,2,3,4 of (1). This gives a solution of (1) on S2n with f = f|S2n, for any [formula]. Fix values of ui on [formula]. Then there is a solution of (1) with f = f|S2n, and ui prescribed on [formula], as above. If |B| > 3, then for n large enough we get [formula], and this will give a boundary for S2n with, either more than four points or, a four-point boundary which does not contain α2n - 1 and α2n. But this is not possible. This shows that |B| = 3 which means S is full.

No finite subset K of S, other than singleton, is full. We prove this by showing that there is a point [formula] with yi∈ΠiK for i = 1,2,3,4 such that [formula] is also good. Any two-point subset of S is not full as any two points of S differ in at least two coordinates. So we can assume that |K|  ≥  3. Let n be the least integer such that K  ⊆  S2n. Then either [formula] or [formula]. If [formula], then let [formula]; otherwise let [formula] Then α2n - 1 and α2n are the coordinates of [formula].

Let [formula] be same as [formula] except that the coordinate α2n is replaced by some other corresponding coordinate of a point in K. Then [formula] Further [formula] is good: for which it is enough to show that [formula] is good.

Consider the (2n + 1)  ×  (2n + 1)-matrix whose columns correspond to the symbols [formula] and rows correspond to the points of [formula]. where the last row has a 1 at the column corresponding to α2n - 1 and a 0 in the column corresponding to α2n. The first 2n rows of this matrix are linearly independent as the set [formula] is good. Further, it is clear that the last row is not a linear combination of the first 2n rows. Therefore [formula] is good. This proves that the related components of S are singletons.

A set with unbounded geodesic length which has bounded solutions for bounded functions [formula]

A modification of this example can be used to answer another question.

Let S be a related set in n-fold cartesian product [formula].

Given two points [formula] the smallest related subset of S containing [formula] and [formula] is called the geodesic between [formula] and [formula] ([\cite=3], p. 190). In [\cite=4], it is shown that if there is an upper bound for lengths of geodesics in S, then the solutions [formula] of (1) are bounded whenever f is bounded. Further, the author surmises that the converse may be true. Namely, that boundedness of geodesic lengths is a necessary condition for bounded solutions [formula] for bounded f. This is true for n = 2. However, for n  ≥  4 we prove that this is not a necessary condition.

Consider the set [formula] where the point [formula] We prove that [formula] is full. First we note that the infinite matrix with rows corresponding to [formula] and columns corresponding to [formula] has an inverse given by Now consider the 4n  ×  4n-matrix A4n with rows corresponding to the points [formula] [formula] and columns corresponding to [formula]:

This matrix is invertible and the inverse is This proves that [formula] is good and {x1,x2,x3} is its boundary. So this set is also full. Note that the sums of the absolute values of entries in a row is less than or equal to 3, for any row, independent of n.

We prove that the geodesic between [formula] and [formula] in [formula] is the whole set [formula] If [formula] is a full set containing [formula] then we have to show that [formula].

First we note that [formula]. If [formula], let i be the number of points of S4n which are not in K. These i points should have at least i symbols occurring in them which are not in [formula] because K is full and, when we add these i points to K the set remains good. These symbols are from [formula] because x1,x2,x3,x4,α4n - 1 and α4n occur as co-ordinates in the points of K. Let [formula] where [formula] be these symbols. If we prove that these symbols are used by at least i + 1 points of S4n, we get a contradiction because these i + 1 points cannot be in K.

For this, we show that the i columns of the matrix A4n corresponding to [formula] have nonzero entries in at least i + 1 rows of A4n. Let us first take the case when αjs  ≠  α1 or α2 for [formula]. Then these i columns contain exactly 3i nonzero entries in them. Any row of A4n contains at most three nonzero entries in it. But observe that the row containing the last nonzero entry of the column corresponding to αji has only one nonzero entry in these i columns. So we need at least i + 1 rows to cover all the nonzero entries of these i columns. Now assume that αjs  =  α1 (or α2) for some s. Then the total number of nonzero entries in these i columns is 3(i - 1) + 2. As in the previous case, there is a row containing only one nonzero entry of these i columns. So again it is easy to see that we need at least i + 1 rows to cover all the nonzero entries in these i columns. In the last case, when αjs  =  α1 and αjt  =  α2 for some 1  ≤  s, t  ≤  i, the total number of nonzero entries in these columns is 3(i - 2) + 2 + 2. But in this case the first row contains only two nonzero entries of these i columns. As before the row containing the last nonzero entry of the column corresponding to αji has only one nonzero entry of these columns. So, again we need at least i + 1 rows to cover the nonzero entries of these columns. This contradiction proves that [formula].

Since the bound on the absolute row sums of A- 14n is independent of n, it is clear how to construct a full set S in which geodesic lengths are not bounded, but solutions [formula] of (1) are bounded for bounded f.

A similar kind of construction is possible for the case n = 3 also and it will be communicated shortly.
