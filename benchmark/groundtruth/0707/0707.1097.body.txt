The strong superadditivity conjecture holds for the quantum depolarizing channel in any dimension

Introduction

A linear trace-preserving map Φ on the set of states (positive unit-trace operators) [formula] in a Hilbert space H is said to be a quantum channel if Φ* is completely positive ([\cite=Hol]). The channel Φ is called bistochastic if [formula]. Here and in the following we denote by d and IH the dimension of H, dimH = d <  +   ∞  , and the identity operator in H, respectively.

Given a quantum channel Φ in a Hilbert space H put ([\cite=Sh])

[formula]

where [formula] and the minimum is taken over all probability distributions π  =  {πj} and states [formula]. Here and in the following S(ρ) =  - Tr(ρ log ρ) is the von Neumann entropy of a state ρ. The strong superadditivity conjecture states that

[formula]

[formula] for two channels Φ and Ψ in Hilbert spaces H and K, respectively.

The infimum of the output entropy of a quantum channel Φ is defined by the formula

[formula]

The additivity conjecture for the quantity Smin(Φ) states ([\cite=Hol2])

[formula]

for an arbitrary quantum channel Ψ. It was shown in ([\cite=Sh]) that if the strong superadditivity conjecture holds, then the additivity conjecture for the quantity Smin holds too. Nevertheless the conjecture ([\ref=strong]) is stronger than ([\ref=addit]).

In the present paper we shall prove the strong superadditivity conjecture for the quantum depolarizing channel for all dimensions of H.

The estimation of the output entropy

Our approach is based upon the estimate of the output entropy proved in [\cite=C02]. Combining formulae (111) and (112) in [\cite=C02] we get the lemma formulated below.

Lemma.Let [formula] be the quantum depolarizing channel in the Hilbert space H of the dimension d. Then, for any quantum channel Ψ there exist the orthonormal basis {es, 1  ≤  s  ≤  d} in H and d states [formula] such that

and

[formula]

where [formula].

In the present paper our goal is to prove the following theorem.

Theorem.Let Φdep be the quantum depolarizing channel in the Hilbert space of the dimension d. Then, for an arbitrary quantum channel Ψ in a Hilbert space K the strong superadditivity conjecture holds, i.e.

[formula]

Proof.

Suppose that

[formula]

and the states ρj, 1  ≤  j  ≤  k, form the optimal ensemble for ([\ref=quant]) in the sense that

[formula]

Applying ([\ref=XJ]) to each element of the sum in ([\ref=avr2]) we get

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula], and each the set {ejs, 1  ≤  s  ≤  d} forms the orthonormal basis of H for 1  ≤  j  ≤  k.

It follows from Lemma that

[formula]

The equality ([\ref=Sup1]) results in

[formula]

Notice that the quantity ([\ref=quant]) is always bounded from below by the quantity ([\ref=addit]). For the quantum depolarizing channel Φdep ([\ref=quant]) coincides with ([\ref=addit]) for any state because ([\ref=addit]) is achieved on any pure input state due to the covariance property of Φdep. Thus, we get

[formula]

[formula]

for any state [formula]. Taking into account ([\ref=A1]),([\ref=E2]) and ([\ref=E3]) we get

[formula]

[formula] Thus, the strong superadditivity conjecture for the quantum depolarizing channel is proved.

Conclusion

At the first time the additivity conjecture ([\ref=conj]) for the quantum depolarizing channel was proved in [\cite=C02]. The method was based upon the estimation of lp-norms of the channel. On the other hand in the papers [\cite=Amo] [\cite=Amo1] [\cite=Amo2] it was shown that the decreasing property of the relative entropy also can be used to prove the additivity conjecture for some partial cases at least. In the present paper we have proved that the estimation of the output entropy obtained in [\cite=C02] allows to prove the strong superadditivity conjecture ([\ref=strong]) for the quantum depolarizing channel. One of a possible basis for considering the strong superadditivity conjecture can be drawn from the paper [\cite=Sh]. There was presented the proof of the global equivalence of the additivity conjecture for the constrained channels and the strong superadditivity conjecture.
