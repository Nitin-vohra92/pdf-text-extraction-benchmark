Task-Oriented Maximally Entangled States

Introduction

One of the sources of mysteries of quantum mechanics is the entanglement. Ever since this idea was introduced by Schrodinger in 1935 [\cite=schr], it has helped in unravelling the mystic of quantum mechanics. The entanglement of a quantum state of a system also allow us to carry out tasks, which would not be possible with a classical system. The entanglement properties of the quantum states are also responsible for the innate nonlocality [\cite=bell] of the quantum mechanical framework. Although this idea is quite old, it is surprising that one still does not understand fully the entanglement properties of a tripartite system in a pure state, or even a bipartite system in a mixed state [\cite=pv]. The proper characterization, quantification and classification of the entanglement properties of a multipartite system [\cite=foot1] is still a developing field [\cite=pv]. In this letter, we focus on systems in pure states.

A bipartite system in a pure state is the simplest system to examine and explore the entanglement properties. The nature of entanglement of such a system is well understood. Such a system has only one bipartite quantum correlation which can be characterized and quantified by the von Neumann entropy [\cite=pr]. It is a suitable entanglement measure [\cite=vp] [\cite=dhr] for such states. This measure maps a bipartite state to a real number. One can order the states according to von Neumann entropy.

Because of the existence of a suitable entanglement measure, there exists the concept of a maximally entangled state. This concept is well defined for bipartite systems which are in pure states and is independent of the entanglement measure. The measure von Neumann entropy is zero for the unentangled systems and one for the maximally entangled systems. The states of the maximally entangled bipartite systems are Bell states which are given below in (1) and (2). Beyond a bipartite system, there is no consensus about what states might be considered maximally entangled. There are numerous suggestions in the literature [\cite=pv] to characterize and quantify the entanglement features of a multipartite state. Some of these measures are quite hard to compute and it is not clear if they satisfy the criteria to be a suitable measure [\cite=vp] [\cite=dhr]. Without a suitable measure, what may be a maximally entangled state is not very clear. On the other hand, if one could identify the set of maximally entangled states, it could help in better understanding and classification of the multipartite entangled states.

In this letter, we take a different approach to identify a maximally entangled state. We suggest that for a multipartite system this notion may not be universal. There may exist a global maxima relative to a specific entanglement measure, but the state with such a property may not be most suitable for most tasks that one may envision. Therefore, we introduce the notion of task-oriented maximally entangled state (TMES). In this approach, there may not be an analog of Bell states for multipartite systems (indeed such a search may not be very useful). Instead there may exist TMESs, that may be suitable to carry out a specific task maximally. For different tasks, one may need different TMESs. A task can be Bell inequalities or some equalities which use the correlations of a quantum state or some communication or processing of information. Some of the communication based tasks are teleportation [\cite=bbcjpw], superdense coding [\cite=bw], multi-receiver superdense coding [\cite=pap], quantum cryptography [\cite=bb], secret sharing [\cite=hbb], telecloning [\cite=mjpv], etc. This operational approach may be more useful. We illustrate this concept by giving a definition of maximally entangled states on the basis of communication tasks of teleportation [\cite=bbcjpw] and superdense coding [\cite=bw]. A quantum state might be considered maximally entangled on the basis of resources available to these communication protocols. In this case, a TMES is the one which can help us to carry out the tasks of teleportation and superdense coding maximally. On the basis of these tasks, we can identify TMESs for a n-qubit system. We can define maximality of these tasks as follows. For maximal teleportation, such an n-qubit state would allow us to teleport an unknown arbitrary [formula]-qubit state, when n is even and [formula]-qubit state, when n is odd. For maximal superdense coding, a n-qubit state would allow us to transmit n classical bits of information by sending [formula] qubits when n is even and [formula] qubits when n is odd [\cite=alt]. For example, when n  =  4, the quadripartite GHZ-state (given below in (3)) is not a TMES because one cannot teleport an unknown arbitrary two-qubit state. Furthermore, although one can transmit two cbits by sending one qubit and three cbits by sending two qubits, one cannot transmit four cbits by sending two qubits from Alice to Bob [\cite=pap]. Therefore, this quadripartite state is not suitable for the maximal teleportation or maximal superdense coding.

It is not surprising that a suitable entanglement measure, i.e. von Neumann entropy exists for bipartite states, since such states have only one bipartite correlation. However in the case of a multipartite entangled state, there exist multiple bipartite, tripartite and higher correlations. Therefore, one number may not be suitable to characterize such states. One may need a set of numbers to characterize such states. Another way to look at could be the following. All bipartite states can be characterized by just one parameter up to unary unitary transformation equivalency. However one needs more than one parameter to characterize a multipartite state. As an example, one needs six such real parameters to characterize a three-qubit state [\cite=eg]. It would appear to be unlikely that the complexity and richness of the state of a multipartite system could be captured by just one number which would characterized the state as an entanglement measure. One may need a set of numbers, a vector measure, to capture the multifaceted entanglement properties of such states. Therefore, if we insist on finding an ordered list of mulipartite entangled states, then it would depend on the correlations one is probing. In particular, there can be a number of different orderings which would depend on the task that we wish to perform using these states. Different tasks would depend on different quantum correlations which need to be maximal for that task. This naturally leads to the idea of TMESs.

TMESs for even number of qubits

For a two-qubit system, the TMESs are well known. These are Bell states,

[formula]

Using these states, one can carry out the conventional teleportation and superdense coding. One can teleport one-qubit state perfectly. One can also transmit two cbits by sending one qubit. Therefore, with Alice and Bob one qubit each, both protocols can be carried out maximally. Alice can convert these states into one another by applying unitary transformations {σ0,σ1,iσ2,σ3} on her qubit. Here σ0 is a 2  ×  2 unit matrix, and σ1,σ2,σ3 are Pauli matrices. As a point of interest, these Bell states can be obtained from the product states {| + 〉|0〉,| - 〉|0〉,| + 〉|1〉,| - 〉|1〉} by applying the CNOT unitary operator UCN. As this operator acts on two qubits, it can entangle them.

Let us now consider the case of larger number of qubits. Before considering a general n-qubit state, let us discuss the case of four-qubit states. There are a number of explicit states that have proposed as the maximally entangled state, as they seem to have some properties that may be desirable in a maximally entangled state. Some of these states are GHZ-state [\cite=ghz] , cluster-state [\cite=br] [\cite=rb], χ-state [\cite=yc] and H-S state [\cite=hs],

[formula]

Here [formula]. We would note that these are prototype states. By applying appropriate multi-unary [\cite=trans] unitary transformations we can construct orthogonal states which would serve the same purpose. It is just like obtaining four Bell states from any one of the Bell states by applying appropriate unary unitary transformations. These multi-unary transformations, by definition, act on qubits separately. There are various arguments that have been put forward to support the case of each state. Some of these are as follow. The GHZ-state has all one qubits in completely mixed state. The |Ω〉 state show certain features of entanglement which are persistent. The |χ〉 state can be used for what we call maximal teleportation and superdense coding. The |HS〉 state has maximized two-qubit correlations. As we shall see later, these states can be TMESs, but for different tasks. But let us first construct TMESs for the tasks of teleportation and superdense coding.

In case of even number of qubits, say 2 d, one can teleport at most an arbitrary unknown d-qubit state. Easiest way to do it is to use d Bell states. Then each qubit of the d-qubit state can be teleported using one of the Bell states. This means that for the larger number of qubits, one could take a direct product of Bell states as the quantum resource. However, as these resource states are not genuinely multipartite entangled states, this resource is not very interesting. However, it turns that by a multinary [\cite=trans] unitary transformation, one could convert these unentangled states into entangled states. Since the teleportation protocol is not affected by these unitary transformations, these states with genuine multipartite entanglement also serve the purpose of teleporting a d-qubit state. We can see this as follows. Suppose we wish to teleport an arbitrary unknown n-qubit state |ψ〉 using the m-qubit state |R〉 as a quantum resource (m  ≥  2n). If the teleportation is successful, then we would be able to write,

[formula]

Here subscripts are particle labels. |Oi〉 are a set of orthogonal states and Vi are unitary operators. Alice would need to send 2n cbits of information to Bob to teleport a n-qubit state. If we apply an unitary transformation [formula] on the both side of the equation, then this transformation would convert the set of orthogonal states |Oi〉 to another such a set. So the teleportation would still be possible, but with a different quantum resource state, Ub1........bm - n|R〉b1b2.....bm. Therefore, if we know a quantum resource state (e.g., a product of Bell states) that would allow the teleportation of an arbitrary unknown n-qubit state, then we can find another resource state by applying appropriate unitary transformation to it [\cite=czg]. Alice can apply this unitary transformation. (Instead of Alice, Bob can also do it.) Interestingly, these entangled states can also be used for maximal superdense coding for even number of qubits. This may not be surprising because of the close relationship between the two tasks. From the procedure, it is also clear that if a resource state can be used to teleport a n-qubit state, it can also be used to teleport any p-qubit state such that p  <  n. We illustrate the procedure for the four-qubit systems.

With a four-qubit entangled state, maximal teleportation will be that of an arbitrary and unknown two-qubit state,

[formula]

Here α,β,γ and δ are complex numbers. As noted above one could use the direct product of two Bell states as a resource. Since there are four Bell states, there are sixteen possibilities. Now we could apply binary unitary operator on two particles of these two states. For concreteness, let us take a situation where Alice and Bob share two copies of the |φ+〉 states. One copy has particles 1 and 2, and the second copy has particles 3 and 4. Let Alice has particles 1 and 3, and Bob has particles 2 and 4. Here, particles 1 & 3 and particles 2 & 4 are not entangled. Alice can now apply the CNOT operation on her qubits. This will entangle her qubits and one would obtain a genuine quadripartite entangled state. This state is actually an example of cluster state,

[formula]

This is a cluster sate and one can explicitly check that one can indeed use it to teleport two-qubit unknown state and also for maximal super dense coding [\cite=pap].

Using a different unitary operator, one can generate |χ〉 states also. The UCN operator has the following representation in the computational basis,

[formula]

Replacing σ1 by σ3 in this matrix will give us the cluster state given in (4). The binary unitary operator that is needed to convert |φ+〉|φ+〉 to the |χ〉 state is,

[formula]

The state |Ω〉 and the state |χ〉 are TMESs from the point of view of the tasks of teleportation and superdense coding. The GHZ-state and HS-state are not TMESs for these tasks, as we can check that these states are not suitable for maximal teleportation and superdense coding. The transformations that can convert two Bell states to these stats are also not unitary, as it should. The HS-state can be a TMES for the task of telecloning. This protocol requires maximized and equal bipartite correlations [\cite=mjpv]. The HS-state is designed that way. For quantum secret sharing, |GHZ〉,|Ω〉, and |χ〉 states can be TMESs, but the |HS〉 state cannot be.

There are many different sets of TMESs from the point of view of maximal teleportation and superdense coding protocols. We have already seen two such sets. One set is that of sixteen orthogonal cluster states, other is that of sixteen orthogonal χ-state. These sets are obtained from the original states by applying multi-unary unitary transformations. One can generate different sets by applying different binary unitary operator on the product of two Bell states. In fact one can construct sixteen linearly independent binary unitary operators that act on two qubits. So we could have sixteen independent such sets. One interesting set of sixteen linearly independent operators including CNOT unitary operator, UCN is:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

If we wish all above matrices to be real, then we can replace σ2 by iσ2 . These matrices are the representation of the operators in the computational basis. Interestingly, all of these operators will generate entangled states from the product of two Bell states. Similarly, one can obtain other sets including CNOT like operators controlled-Y and controlled-Z,

[formula]

One can obtain other sets by applying unitary transformation on the above matrices. To obtain TMESs for the six-qubit systems and beyond, one can apply CNOT unitary operator on two pairs of qubits. For example, if Alice has qubits 1,3 and 5, while Bob has the qubits 2,4 and 6, then Alice can apply UCN13 and UCN35 to obtain a TMES. As noted above this TMES is not unique. One could apply any other set of binary or even a multinary unitary operator. By applying such linearly independent unitary operators, one can generate all sets.

This process can be extended to any 2 d-qubit state. In particular, one could apply CNOT operations, or any other binary unitary operations suggested above, on suitable d - 1 pairs of qubits. Or, one may choose to apply a multinary unitary operator on any other subsets or on all d qubits. This procedure will give us genuinely entangled n-qubit states (n even) which are TMESs. One way to obtain an independent set of such multinary operators is to extend the procedure that we have used to obtain the set {Γa} that act on two-qubits using the set {σa} that act on one-qubit. This procedure allows us to construct the matrices for (d + 1)-qubits from those that act on d-qubits. For d  =  1 and 2, we have given these matrices above. Let the independent set of the unitary operators that act on d-qubits be {γa}, where a  =  1,2,.....22d. Then for the (d + 1)-qubits, we can construct 22d + 2 linearly independent unitary matrices Σa as follow,

It is our conjecture that using this procedure, one can, in principle, generate all suitable states that can be quantum resource in teleporting an arbitrary and unknown d-qubit state and for superdense coding.

TMESs for odd number of qubits

For the systems with odd number of qubits, first non-trivial system is that of three qubits. None of the three-qubit states cannot be used to teleport an unknown arbitrary two-qubit state [\cite=ap2]. This is also clear from the fact that the construction of this state requires only one Bell state, as we shall see below. Furthermore since the Hilbert space of a three-qubit system is only eight-dimensional, one cannot transmit four cbits by transmitting two qubits. At most three cbits could be transmitted. To obtain an TMES for 2 d + 1 qubits, one can start with the tensor product of d Bell states and a computational basis state. In the case of three-qubits system, e.g., we could have,

[formula]

This is a GHZ state. For a three-qubit systems it is a TMES for the tasks of superdense coding and teleportation. We note there exist a subclass of W-sates [\cite=ap] which can also be used for the teleportation,

[formula]

Since this state can be used for the maximal teleportation, one should be able to obtain it after applying suitable multinary unitary transformations on |φ+〉|0〉. For example this transformation for the |W2〉 state is,

[formula]

This state is also suitable for transmitting three cbits by sending two qubits, but not for all 2 - 1 partitions of three qubits. Since our definition of the maximal superdense coding does not have any requirement for partitions, this state is also a TMES. We note that the product state |φ+〉|0〉 can be used for maximal superdense coding also.

Let us now consider a system of five qubits. For such a system TMES would not be a GHZ state [\cite=pap]. However, we can obtain TMESs by applying appropriate unitary transformations on the product state of two Bell states and a computational basis state. One way is,

[formula]

This state is a TMES for a five-qubit system corresponding to the tasks of teleportation and superdense coding. This is because it can be used for maximal superdense coding and teleportation. One can teleport an unknown arbitrary two-qubit state and transmit five cbits by sending three qubits. This is also an example of cluster state for five qubits. As discussed in the case of even number of qubit system, this state is not unique. By applying multi-unary unitary transformations on three qubits, one can obtain thirty-two orthogonal states, which will serve the same purpose. Furthermore, by applying linearly independent multinary unitary transformations, given in the last section, one can obtain linearly independent sets of TMESs. By maximizing negativity numerically, Brown et al [\cite=bssb] have obtained a "highly entangled" five-qubit state. Their state is a TMES for ours tasks. One can obtain it by applying an appropriate multinary unitary transformation. This state does not have all maximized bipartite correlations.

One can generalize this procedure to any odd number of qubit system. So, for a 2 d + 1 qubit system one has to consider the product state of d Bell states and a one-qubit state and apply a suitable multinary unitary transformation. This will make the 2d + 1 qubits genuinely entangled. This can serve as the resource for the maximal teleportation and superdense coding. In the last section we have given a more detailed procedure and sets of unitary matrices that can be used for the transformations.

Conclusions

We have argued that the universal maximally entangled state in the case of multipartite systems may not be generally useful, even if such a state could be identified. Instead the notion of a task-oriented maximally entangled state (TMES) may be more fruitful. This makes the notion of maximally entangled states task-dependent. For different tasks, different states may allow us to carry out the task maximally. We have illustrated this idea on the basis of the communication tasks of teleportation and superdense coding. To this end, we have given strategy to obtain instances of the TMESs corresponding to these tasks. We conjecture that using our procedure one would be able to obtain all states that may be suitable for the teleportation and superdense coding. Similarly, for other tasks, one may obtain the suitable TMESs.
