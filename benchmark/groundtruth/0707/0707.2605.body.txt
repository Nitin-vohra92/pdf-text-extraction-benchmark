A sheaf of Hochschild complexes on quasi-compact opens

Introduction

Let X be a scheme over a field k. In [\cite=lowenvandenbergh2], the Hochschild complex [formula] of X is defined to be the Hochschild complex of the abelian category [formula] of sheaves on X. Its cohomology theory coincides with various notions of Hochschild cohomology of X considered in the literature, for example by Swan [\cite=swan] and Kontsevich [\cite=kontsevich], which in the commutative case agree with the earlier theory of Gerstenhaber-Schack [\cite=gerstenhaberschack2].

For a basis [formula] of affine opens of X, there is an associated k-linear category (also denoted by [formula]) and there is a quasi-isomorphism

[formula]

where [formula] is the Hochschild complex of the k-linear category [formula] (§ [\ref=hochscheme]). The Hochschild complexes have a considerable amount of extra structure containing in particular the cup-product and the Gerstenhaber bracket. This extra structure is important for deformation theory. It is captured by saying that the complexes are B∞-algebras [\cite=getzlerjones] [\cite=keller6], and [formula] as above means the existence of an isomorphism in the homotopy category of B∞-algebras. Let [formula] be the restriction of [formula] to the basis [formula]. Then [formula] above is reflected in the fact that there is an equivalence between the deformation theory of [formula] as an abelian category [\cite=lowenvandenbergh1] and the deformation theory of [formula] as a twisted presheaf [\cite=lowen4].

If we consider the restrictions [formula] of [formula] to open subsets U  ⊂  X, we obtain a presheaf of Hochschild complexes on X

[formula]

To relate the "global" Hochschild complex [formula] to the "local" Hochschild complexes [formula] of certain open subsets U  ⊂  X, it would be desirable for [formula] to be a sheaf, which is preferably acyclic for taking global sections. Unfortunately, [formula] is not even a separated presheaf with regard to finite coverings. In this paper, we construct a sheaf [formula] of B∞-algebras such that

[formula] for U quasi-compact open.

[formula] is acyclic for taking quasi-compact sections, i.e. [formula] for U quasi-compact open.

For U quasi-compact open, [formula] is obtained as a colimit of complexes [formula] over a collection [formula] of bases of U (§ [\ref=presheaf]). The properties of [formula] depend upon the choice of a good presheaf [formula] of bases (Definition [\ref=good]).

From properties (1) and (2), we readily deduce the existence of a local to global spectral sequence

[formula]

for Hochschild cohomology for a quasi-compact scheme X (Theorem [\ref=spectr]).

We should remark that for a smooth separated scheme, another sheaf of B∞-algebras [formula] is considered for example by Kontsevich [\cite=Kontsevich1], Van den Bergh [\cite=vandenbergh4], Yekutieli [\cite=yekutieli1]. Let [formula] be the Hochschild complex of the ring [formula], and let [formula] be the subcomplex which consists of the polydifferential operators, i.e. multilinear maps [formula] which are differential operators in each argument. Then for U affine open [formula] satisfies

[formula]

The complex [formula] computes the Hochschild cohomology of X, but a priori does not inherit the structure of B∞-algebra. One way to overcome this problem is by using a fibrant resolution [formula] in the model category of presheaves of B∞-algebras as defined by Hinich [\cite=hinich1]. Alternatively, in [\cite=vandenbergh4], Van den Bergh constructs a quasi-isomorphic object [formula] that does inherit this structure (the construction, which uses pro-hypercoverings, is functorial and inherits any operad-algebra structure). Moreover, [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] in the homotopy category of B∞-algebras [\cite=vandenbergh4] and by [\cite=vandenbergh4], we actually have [formula] in the same sense.

Finally, as to the existence of a local to global spectral sequence for Hochschild cohomology for a general ringed space [formula], a proof using hypercoverings is in preparation [\cite=lowenvandenbergh3].

Presheaves of Hochschild complexes

The Hochschild complex of a scheme

Throughout, k is a field. Let [formula] be a scheme over k and let [formula] be a basis of affine opens. We use the same notation for the associated k-linear category with [formula] as objects and

[formula]

In [\cite=lowenvandenbergh2], the Hochschild complex [formula] of X is defined and in [\cite=lowenvandenbergh2], there is shown to be a quasi-isomorphism

[formula]

where [formula] is the Hochschild complex of the k-linear category [formula] [\cite=mitchell], i.e.

[formula]

and the differential is the usual Hochschild differential. More concretely, we have

[formula]

[formula]

Hence this complex combines the nerve of the poset [formula] with the algebraic structure of [formula]. In fact, both complexes are B∞-algebras [\cite=getzlerjones] [\cite=keller6] and [formula] means the existence of an isomorphism in the homotopy category of B∞-algebras.

The presheaf [formula] of Hochschild complexes

For an arbitrary open subset U  ⊂  X, put [formula]. Then [formula] is a basis of affine opens for the scheme [formula], hence we have a quasi-isomorphism

[formula]

For V  ⊂  U there is an obvious restriction map

[formula]

We thus obtain a presheaf

[formula]

of Hochschild complexes on X. It is readily seen that in general, [formula] fails to be a sheaf. Indeed, suppose we have [formula] and [formula] with U and V proper open subsets. Then there is a non-zero element [formula] with

[formula]

whose restriction to U and V is zero. In this example, the fact that [formula] makes the presence of W in [formula] redundant. This suggests that to obtain a sheaf, we have to work with variable bases, as will be done in the next section.

The presheaf [formula] of colimit Hochschild complexes

In this section we will consider instead of [formula] for a fixed basis [formula] of X, a colimit of complexes [formula] over different bases [formula] of U. More precisely, we are looking for collections [formula] of bases of affine opens of U, which allow us to define "colimit Hochschild complexes"

[formula]

Here [formula] is ordered by ⊃   and [formula] corresponds to the canonical [formula]. Since we do not want the colimit to change the cohomology, we want it to be a filtered colimit. In particular, this is the case if [formula] is closed under intersections, i.e. if we have the operation

[formula]

Note that in general, [formula] need not even be a basis. If [formula] and we have ([\ref=doorsnede]), then there are quasi-isomorphisms

[formula]

For [formula] to become a presheaf, we need restriction operations

[formula]

for V  ⊂  U, making [formula] itself into a presheaf of collections of bases. In this way, [formula] clearly becomes a presheaf of B∞-algebras on X.

In order to prove Proposition [\ref=fincov] in the next section, we need two more operations on [formula]. First, we want to take the union of bases coinciding on the intersection of their domains, i.e. we want the operation

[formula]

Secondly, we want to refine bases by plugging in finer bases, i.e. for V  ⊂  U we want the operation

[formula]

Note that ([\ref=doorsnede]) is just a special case of ([\ref=plug]). Also, combining ([\ref=restr]), ([\ref=glue]) and ([\ref=plug]) yields the following refinement operation on [formula]. If δ is any finite collection of open subsets of U (not necessarily covering U), we have

[formula]

[formula] is called good if [formula] and [formula] has the operations ([\ref=doorsnede]), , ([\ref=delta]).

We will now show that there exists a good [formula].

If [formula] with [formula] has ([\ref=restr]), ([\ref=glue]) and ([\ref=plug]), then it is good.

Let [formula] be any basis of affine opens of X. There exists a smallest good [formula] with [formula]. This [formula] is given by

[formula]

(1) follows from the discussion above. For (2), first note that [formula] is obviously contained in any good [formula]. If V  ⊂  U and δ is a collection in U, we put [formula]. For any basis [formula] of U, we have [formula] so ([\ref=restr]) holds. For ([\ref=plug]), note that [formula]. Finally for ([\ref=glue]), if [formula] and [formula] coincide on [formula], then their union equals [formula].

Sheaves of Hochschild complexes

The presheaf [formula] for a good [formula]

From now on, [formula] is a good presheaf of bases and we consider the presheaf [formula] of colimit Hochschild complexes as defined in § [\ref=presheaf].

[formula] is flabby.

[formula] satisfies the sheaf condition with respect to finite coverings.

(2) By induction, we may consider [formula] and given elements [formula] such that φ1|U12  =  φ2|U12, where [formula]. Let φi be a representing element in [formula] for a basis [formula] and let [formula] be a basis in [formula] for which φ1|U12 and φ2|U12 coincide in [formula]. Put [formula] (using ([\ref=plug])) and put [formula] (using ([\ref=glue])). We can now easily give an element [formula] which represents a glueing of φ1 and φ2 on U, by specifying its value for [formula]: if [formula], we use the element specified by φi. This is well defined since [formula] implies [formula]. It is a glueing of the φi since φ and φi coincide on [formula].

Now suppose we have an element [formula] for [formula] and suppose we have bases [formula] for which φ|Ui becomes zero in [formula]. If we put [formula] and [formula], then φ becomes zero in [formula].

(1) Consider the restriction map [formula] for V  ⊂  U. If [formula] is a representing element in the codomain, we can lift it to [formula] where [formula] is arbitrary and the value of [formula] for [formula] is the value specified by φ if Vp  ⊂  V and is zero else.

The sheaf [formula] of colimit Hochschild complexes

Let [formula] be the subposet of quasi-compact opens with the induced Grothendieck topology. We immediately get:

The restriction [formula] of [formula] to [formula] is a sheaf.

Since every covering of a quasi-compact U  ⊂  X has a finite subcovering, it suffices to check the sheaf condition on finite coverings, which is done in Proposition [\ref=fincov].

The sheaf [formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] (resp. [formula] and [formula]) be the categories of presheaves and sheaves on X (resp. on [formula]). Since [formula] is a basis of X, by the (proof of the) Lemme the Comparaison [\cite=artingrothendieckverdier1], there is a commutative square

[formula]

in which the vertical arrows are sheafifications, the horizontal arrows are restrictions to [formula], and the lower horizontal arrow is an equivalence. Let [formula] be the sheafification of [formula].

If U  ⊂  X is a quasi-compact open, then

[formula]

is an isomorphism. In particular, there is a quasi-isomorphism

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=sheaf] we have [formula].

[formula] is acyclic for taking quasi-compact sections, i.e. for U  ⊂  X a quasi-compact open and i  >  0, we have [formula].

By Propositions [\ref=fincov](1) and [\ref=nochange], the restriction maps [formula] are surjective for U quasi-compact. The rest of the proof is along the lines of the classical proof that flabby sheaves are acyclic for taking global sections.

Local to global spectral sequence

In this section, X is a quasi-compact scheme and [formula] is the sheaf of complexes of § [\ref=thesheaf]. In particular, there are quasi-isomorphisms [formula] for U quasi-compact open. We obtain a local to global spectral sequence for Hochschild cohomology:

There is a local to global spectral sequence

[formula]

Since, by Proposition [\ref=acyc], [formula] is a bounded below complex of acyclic objects for Γ, [formula] is itself acyclic i.e. [formula]. So the above is just the hypercohomology spectral sequence [\cite=grothendieck] for the complex of sheaves [formula].
