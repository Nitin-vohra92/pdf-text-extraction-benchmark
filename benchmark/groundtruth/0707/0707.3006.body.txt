Spin effects in p interaction and their possible use to polarize antiproton beams.

Introduction

An extensive physical program with polarized antiprotons has been proposed recently by the PAX Collaboration [\cite=PAX05]. This program has initiated a wide discussion on the possibility to use a polarized hydrogen gas target to polarize stored antiprotons (see [\cite=PAX05] [\cite=Rathman05] and literature therein). Various modifications of the filtering method first proposed in Ref. [\cite=Csonka68] have been considered. The filtering method exploits the dependence of the scattering cross section on the orientations of the target and projectile proton (antiproton) spins. Due to this dependence beam protons with positive spin projections on the direction of the target polarization scatter out of the beam ( scattering angle ϑ larger than the acceptance angle θacc  ≪  1) at a rate different from protons with a negative spin projection. As a result the beam becomes polarized. This method can also be used for the antiproton beam.

In Refs.[\cite=MilStr05] [\cite=Kolya06], it was shown that , for ϑ  <  θacc (a proton or antiproton remains in the beam), the polarization buildup is completely due to the spin-flip transitions. The corresponding cross sections turn out to be negligibly small for both proton-proton and proton-electron scattering. For a pure electron target, filtering mechanism also does not provide a noticeable polarization, Ref.[\cite=MilStr05]. Thus, it is necessary to study in detail the filtering method for the antiproton beam using a hydrogen gas target with the proton polarization.

The method suggested in [\cite=Csonka68] has been realized in the experiment [\cite=Haeberli93], where 23-MeV stored protons scattered on an internal gas target of the polarized hydrogen atoms. The measured polarization degree is in reasonable agreement with the theoretical predictions based on the known pp scattering cross section , see discussion in Refs.[\cite=MilStr05] [\cite=Kolya06] [\cite=Rathman05]. Theoretical prediction for the rate of polarization buildup of the antiproton beam is essentially more complicated problem because the spin-dependent part of the p scattering cross section is not well known both theoretically and experimentally. Theoretical evaluation of this cross section contains some uncertainties because nowadays QCD can not describe quantitatively the low energy nucleon-antinucleon interaction. Therefore, it was necessary to apply various phenomenological approaches in order to explain numerous experimental data , see , e.g., Refs. [\cite=pot82] [\cite=bonn91] [\cite=bonn95] [\cite=paris82] [\cite=paris94] [\cite=Partial94] and recent reviews [\cite=KBMR02] [\cite=KBR05]. However, some parameters of the models determining the spin-dependent part of the cross sections are not well defined from the experimental data available [\cite=Rich94].

In the present paper, we calculate the cross section of polarized proton and antiproton interaction using the Paris nucleon-antinucleon optical potential VNN̄ with the parameters given in Refs.[\cite=paris82] [\cite=paris94] [\cite=paris99]. This potential has the form:

[formula]

where the real part UNN̄ is the G-parity transform of the well established Paris NN potential for the long- and medium-ranged distances ([formula]), and some phenomenological part for shorter distances. The absorptive part, WNN̄, of the optical potential takes into account the inelastic channels of NN̄ interaction, i.e. annihilation into mesons, being important at short distances. Our knowledge of WNN̄ is more restricted than that of UNN̄.

Cross sections

It is convenient to calculate the cross sections of p scattering in the center-of-mass frame where antiproton and proton have the momenta [formula] and [formula], respectively. We assume that p  ≪  M ( M is the proton mass) and perform calculations in the nonrelativistic approximation, so that the momentum of antiproton in the lab frame is [formula]. Let us direct the polar axis z along the unit vector [formula]. Kinetics of polarization depends on the cross section

[formula]

where σann is the annihilation cross section, σcex is the charge-exchange cross section of the process p  →  nn̄ , and σel is the elastic cross section of p scattering summed up over final spin states, integrated over the azimuth angle, and over the scattering angle ϑ from the acceptance angle θacc to π. We remind that θacc is defined in the center-of-mass frame. In the lab frame the acceptance angle is θ(l)acc  =  θacc / 2 . The cross section σ has the form

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are the unit polarization vectors of the proton and antiproton, respectively. For example, σ  =  σ0  +  σ2 for [formula] and [formula] ; σ  =  σ0  +  σ1 for [formula] and [formula].

We choose the quantization axes along the vector [formula] and express the spin wave function of the initial p state via the spin wave function, corresponding to the total spin S = 1 and projection Sz  =  μ, and the spin wave function, corresponding to the total spin S = 0. Then we obtain

[formula]

where Σ1μ is the cross section calculated for the total spin S = 1 and Jz  =  μ, Jz is the projection of the total angular momentum, Σ00 is the cross section calculated for the total spin S = 0 (so that Jz = 0). Note that Σ11  =  Σ1 - 1.

Our potential is a sum of the nucleon-antinucleon optical potential VNN̄ and the Coulomb potential VC(r) =  - e2 / r, where e is the proton charge. The hadronic amplitude can be represented as a sum of a pure electromagnetic amplitude and the strong amplitude. We emphasize that the latter does not coincide with the strong amplitude calculated without account for the electromagnetic interaction. The strong amplitude is not singular at small scattering angle ϑ. In the nonrelativistic limit, the triplet FC1 and singlet FC0 electromagnetic amplitudes coincide with the amplitude fC(ϑ) where

[formula]

where v = p / M is the nucleon (antinucleon) velocity in the center-of-mass frame, α = e2 is the fine structure constant. It was shown in Ref.[\cite=MilStr05] that, for time comparable with the beam life-time, the polarization degree of the antiproton beam, PB, is determined by the ratio σ1,2  /  σ0. The pure Coulomb cross section is spin independent and, therefore, contributes only to σ0 that diminishes the ratio σ1,2  /  σ0. Therefore, we do not consider very small c. m. energies E < 5 MeV because in this region the Coulomb cross section becomes essentially larger than the nuclear cross section. Note that the interference of the Coulomb amplitude and the spin-dependent part of the strong amplitude, corresponding to elastic scattering without spin flip, may be important [\cite=Meyer94].

In our calculation, we use the standard partial-wave analysis (see, e.g., Refs.[\cite=paris94] [\cite=Partial94]). For the strong elastic triplet scattering amplitude (p  →  p), we have

[formula]

where summation over L,  L' is performed under the conditions L,  L' = J,  J  ±  1 and |L - L'| = 0,  2. The strong singlet elastic scattering amplitude is given by

[formula]

In Eqs.([\ref=Tripl]) and ([\ref=Singl]), SJLL' and SL are the partial elastic triplet and singlet scattering amplitudes, respectively, YL  m(ϑ,φ) are the spherical functions, CJμLm,1μ - m are Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The charge exchange amplitude (p  →  nn̄) is given by

[formula]

for the triplet contribution and

[formula]

for the singlet one. In Eqs.([\ref=Triplcex]) and ([\ref=Singlcex]), S̃JLL' and S̃L are the partial charge exchange triplet and singlet scattering amplitudes, respectively.

The cross sections Σ1μ and Σ00 can be represented as a sum of pure Coulomb contributions, ΣC1μ and ΣC00, hadronic contributions, Σh1μ and Σh00, and the interference terms, Σint1μ and Σint00. For Coulomb contributions, we have

[formula]

where a smallness of θacc is taken into account. It follows from the optical theorem that the total hadronic cross sections are

[formula]

The terms in the cross section corresponding to the interference of the Coulomb and the strong elastic p amplitudes read

[formula]

The hadronic contributions to the elastic cross section of p  →  p process have the form:

[formula]

The cross sections of the charge exchange process p  →  nn̄ are:

[formula]

Numerical results

Using the results obtained above we can discuss the kinetics of the polarization buildup. Let [formula] be the target polarization vector and [formula]. The arising polarization [formula] of the antiproton beam is collinear to [formula]. The general solution of the kinetic equation describing the polarization buildup is given in [\cite=MilStr05]. As shown in this paper, under certain conditions which are usually fulfilled in storage rings, the quantity PB(t) and the number of particles in the beam N(t) have the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here n is the areal density of the target , f is a revolution frequency of the beam. The function PB(t) in Eq.([\ref=PB]) contains Ωout± only in the combination Ωout-  -  Ωout+. For |σ2| > |σ1|, this difference is maximal at [formula]. For |σ2| < |σ1|, the difference is maximal at [formula].

Our estimation shows that |Ωout-  -  Ωout+|  ≪  (Ωout-  +  Ωout+), and below this relation is assumed to be fulfilled. Then the beam lifetime, τb, due to the interaction with a target is

[formula]

Note that the Figure Of Merit, FOM(t) = P2B(t)N(t), is maximal at t0 = 2τb when the number of antiprotons is N(t0)  ≈  0.14N(0). For the polarization degree at t0 we have

[formula]

The positive (negative) value of PB(t0) means that the beam polarization is parallel (antiparallel) to [formula].

Predictions for the total and elastic cross sections, obtained using the Paris potential with the parameters from Refs.[\cite=paris82] [\cite=paris94] [\cite=paris99], are in good agreement with the experimental data. However, the spin-dependent parts, σ1 and σ2, of the cross section are rather small in comparison with the total one. Therefore, we can not exclude that the accuracy in our predictions for σ1 and σ2 would be worse than that for the total cross section. The dependence of σ1 and σ2 on the antiproton kinetic energy in the lab frame, T, is shown in Fig.[\ref=sig12] in the interval 20  ÷  100  MeV for a several values of the acceptance angle.

The dependence of σ1,2 on θacc is completely due to interference of the Coulomb and the strong elastic amplitudes. This interference was very important for describing the proton beam polarization buildup due to pp scattering, significantly diminishing both spin-dependent contributions ( σ1,2) to the cross section , see Refs.[\cite=Meyer94] [\cite=MilStr05]. Interference turns out to be even more important in the p case, drastically modifying σ1,2 as compared with the pure strong contribution. The corresponding quantities, σint1,2, are shown in Fig.[\ref=sig12int]. It is seen that σint1 is rather close to σint2.

The dependence of PB(t0) on T is shown in Fig.[\ref=polar] for PT = 1 , [formula] ([formula]), and [formula] ([formula]). It is seen that [formula] has a maximum at energies [formula]. The position of this maximum shifts to the left with the increasing acceptance angle. The maximal value of PB(t0) also increases with growing θacc though this growth becomes slower at larger θacc. For [formula], the corresponding beam polarization [formula] becomes noticeable only for sufficiently large T where t0 would be too large. The dependence of t0 = 2τb , Eq.([\ref=tb]), on T is shown in Fig.[\ref=figtau] for n = 1014  - 2, f = 106  - 1, and several values of the acceptance angle. It is seen that for these realistic values of the density n and acceptance angle θlacc, the polarization time is rather reasonable.

In conclusion, using the Paris nucleon-antinucleon optical potential, we have calculated the spin-dependent part of the cross section of p interaction and the corresponding degree of the beam polarization. Our results indicate that a filtering mechanism can provide a noticeable beam polarization in a reasonable time.
