Extremal Problems in Minkowski Space related to Minimal Networks

Introduction

In [\cite=LM] Lawlor and Morgan derived a geometrical description for the singularities (Steiner points) of a length-minimizing network connecting a finite set of points in a smooth Minkowski space (finite dimensional Banach space). In Euclidean space the geometrical description is equivalent to the classical result that at a singularity three line segments meet at [formula] angles. See also [\cite=BG], [\cite=M] and [\cite=CR] for a discussion of length-minimizing networks and their history. The geometrical description of Lawlor and Morgan leads to extremal problems of a combinatorial type in strictly convex Minkowski spaces. Such problems are considered in [\cite=FLM]. In this note we briefly remark on some of these problems and solve one of the open problems stated in [\cite=FLM] (see theorem [\ref=mainth]).

Preliminaries

We denote the real numbers by [formula] and the real vector space of n-tuples of real numbers by [formula]. The coordinates of a vector [formula] will be denoted by [formula]. The standard basis [formula] will be used, where [formula] is the vector for which [formula] and [formula] for i  ≠  j. A Minkowski space (or finite-dimensional Banach space) [formula] is [formula] endowed with a norm Φ. A Minkowski space is strictly convex if [formula] implies [formula].

We denote by [formula] the n-dimensional Minkowski space with norm

[formula]

for p  ≥  1, and by [formula] the space with norm

[formula]

We now state Auerbach's lemma which relates the spaces [formula] and [formula] to an arbitrary Minkowski space in n dimensions. A proof may be found in [\cite=Pietsch].

We denote the n-dimensional Lebesgue measure (or volume) of measurable [formula] by [formula]. If [formula], then we define [formula]. The Brunn-Minkowski inequality relates the volumes of compact U and V to that of U + V. A proof may be found in [\cite=BZ].

Extremal Problems

From now on S will denote a finite set of unit vectors in a Minkowski space. In [\cite=FLM] the following type of extremal problems is considered: Find the largest cardinality of S satisfying a selection of the following conditions:

[formula]

See [\cite=LM] and [\cite=FLM] for the connection between these conditions and minimal networks. In [\cite=FLM] it is proved that (A') and (B') together give an upper bound |S|  ≤  2n for an arbitrary Minkowski space, and |S|  ≤  n + 1 for strictly convex Minkowski spaces. In [\cite=LM] it is proved that there exist a strictly convex norm on [formula] and a subset S of n + 1 unit vectors satisfying (A) and (B). |S|  =  2n is attained in for example [formula] with [formula], in which case even the strong conditions (A) and (B) hold. However, there are other Minkowski spaces where equality is also attained (see theorem [\ref=th1]). This is to be contrasted with theorem [\ref=mainth] where we show that the extreme case for S satisfying (A) and (B) can only be attained for [formula].

For infinitely many [formula] there exists a set of unit vectors [formula] satisfying (A') and the strong balancing condition (B). In particular, such a set exists if a Hadamard matrix of order n exists.

We recall that an n  ×  n Hadamard matrix H consists of (  ±  1)-entries such that HHt  =  nI, and such matrices exist for infinitely many n (see [\cite=vLW]). We let [formula] be the column vectors of H, and set [formula] for [formula]. Then [formula] is a set of 2n unit vectors. Since the column vectors of H are orthogonal, [formula] for i  ≠  j, implying that [formula] and [formula] for all i  ≠  j. It follows that S satisfies (A') and (B).

The question now is what happens if there is no balancing condition present. In [\cite=FLM] an upper bound of |S|  <  3n is derived from the weak collapsing condition (A') alone using a volume argument. Using the Brunn-Minkowski inequality we obtain a sharper bound (theorem [\ref=th2]). In [\cite=FLM] a strictly convex norm and a set S of unit vectors with |S|  ≥  (1.02)n satisfying (A') are constructed for all sufficiently large n. It would be interesting to find the greatest lower bound of the α's for which |S|  ≤  αn for any set S of unit vectors in an arbitrary Minkowski space satisfying (A'), and sufficiently large n.

If a set S of unit vectors in [formula] satisfy (A'), then |S|  <  2n + 1.

We denote the closed unit ball with centre [formula] and radius r by [formula], and the volume of a ball of unit radius by β. For distinct [formula] we obtain from the triangle inequality that [formula]. Let k = |S|. We partition S into two sets S1 and S2 of sizes ⌊k  /  2⌋ and ⌈k  /  2⌉, respectively. Let [formula] for i = 1,2. Clearly, each Vi consists of closed balls with disjoint interiors, and therefore, [formula] and [formula]. Using (A') we obtain [formula], and [formula]. By the Brunn-Minkowski inequality we now have

[formula]

and |S|  <  2n + 1.

From the above proof we actually find that if [formula] and [formula] imply [formula], then |S|  ≤  2(1 + 1 / r)n + 1 for S satisfying (A'). Such is the case for [formula]: It follows from the Clarkson inequality [\cite=C] for p  ≥  2, and the Hanner inequality [\cite=H] for 1 < p < 2, that r may be taken to be 31 / p for p  ≥  2, and (2p - 1)1 / p for 1 < p < 2.

For [formula] an upper bound |S|  ≤  2n holds: If the coordinates of two unit vectors [formula] and [formula] have the same sequence of signs, i.e. [formula] for all [formula], then [formula], contradicting (A'). In the Euclidean case [formula] we of course have |S|  ≤  3, independent of n. For [formula] the sharp upper bound |S|  ≤  2n holds: If |S|  ≥  2n + 1, then by the pigeon-hole principle there are three vectors [formula] and an [formula] such that [formula]. Some two of these vectors will have the same sign in the ith coordinate, and their sum will then have a norm of 2.

In [\cite=FLM] the question is asked whether the strong collapsing condition (A) on its own gives an upper bound for |S| that is polynomial in n. A linear upper bound may be derived by the same technique as in theorem [\ref=th2]. We partition the elements of S except for at most 2 into subsets [formula] of size 3, where k = ⌊|S| / 3⌋. For [formula] let

[formula]

From (A) it follows that each Vi consists of 6 balls with disjoint interiors, and [formula]. By the Brunn-Minkowski inequality we obtain [formula], and k  ≤  2 / (61 / n - 1). Therefore, |S|  ≤  6 / (61 / n - 1) + 2  <  (6 /  ln 6)n, after some calculus. This bound is not sharp, however. In the following theorem we derive the sharp upper bound |S|  ≤  2n.

Let S be a finite set of unit vectors in a Minkowski space [formula] satisfying the collapsing condition (A). Then |S|  ≤  2n, and equality holds iff [formula] is linearly isometric to [formula], with S corresponding to the set [formula] under any isometry.

By Auerbach's lemma we may assume (after applying a linear isomorphism of [formula]) that for any vector [formula] the inequalities [\eqref=eq:auerbach] hold, with T now the identity. Choose m distinct vectors [formula] from S. By [\eqref=eq:auerbach] we have

[formula]

Suppose that for some coordinate [formula] we have

[formula]

Then

[formula]

by [\eqref=eq:auerbach], contradicting (A). Therefore,

[formula]

and similarly,

[formula]

From [\eqref=ineq2] and [\eqref=ineq3] it follows that [formula] for all [formula], and from [\eqref=ineq1] we have

[formula]

and |S|  ≤  2n.

If |S|  =  2n for some set of unit vectors [formula] satisfying (A), then equality must hold in [\eqref=ineq4], [\eqref=ineq2] and [\eqref=ineq3]. Therefore, [formula], showing that in the extreme case the strong balancing condition (B) must be satisfied. We now show that conditions (A) and (B) together with the assumption |S| = 2n imply that [formula] is linearly isometric to [formula], and S corresponds to [formula], as claimed in [\cite=FLM].

We recall theorem 3.1 of [\cite=FLM]:

If [formula] is a Minkowski space and S is a set of unit vectors satisfying (A') and (B'), then |S|  ≤  2n, and if equality holds, then S corresponds to [formula] under some linear isomorphism.

We therefore have [formula] where the [formula]'s are linearly independent. We first show that if [formula] then [formula] must hold. For [formula] choose [formula] such that [formula]. After renaming, we may assume [formula]. The ji's must be distinct, otherwise (A) is contradicted. We may therefore rename the [formula]'s to obtain [formula] for [formula]. If we have [formula] for some i  ≠  j, then either [formula] or [formula], contradicting (A). Therefore, [formula] for all i  ≠  j, and we have [formula].

To show that in fact [formula] is linearly isometric to [formula], we use the following theorem of Petty [\cite=Petty] (see also [\cite=FLM]):

If T is a subset of a Minkowski space [formula] such that [formula] for all [formula], then |T|  ≤  2n, with equality iff [formula] is linearly isometric to [formula].

We will apply this theorem to the set [formula]. Obviously |T| = 2n. We now show that

[formula]

thus completing the proof. Firstly, we have

[formula]

by (A). Secondly, [formula] or [formula], since A  ≠  B. We assume without loss that [formula] and choose [formula]. Then

[formula]

showing that [\eqref=eq1] holds.

For strictly convex norms the bound in the above theorem should perhaps be |S|  ≤  n + 1, but this seems to require a new idea.
