Identified particle measurements at large transversemomenta in Cu+Cu collisions at RHIC.

Introduction

Nucleus-nucleus collisions at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) have produced charged particle measurements that show two dramatic effects which cannot be explained in terms of a simple extrapolation from p+p collision data. Such effects, for example high-pT hadron suppression in central Au+Au collisions [\cite=cite:STAR_SpectralSuppression] [\cite=cite:STAR_BackToBack], have been attributed to partonic energy loss in the hot, dense medium created in the ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions [\cite=cite:STAR_dAuBackToBack]. In these proceedings, a systematic study of this and other effects will be presented in terms of identified particle measurements in Cu+Cu collisions at [formula] 200 GeV.

In elementary collisions, hard partonic scatterings are known to produce jets of particles originating from a fragmenting high-pT quark or gluon. Spectral distributions of particles in transverse momentum from such interactions are measured from experiment and are reasonably well understood from NLO pQCD calculations [\cite=cite:STAR_Id200dAupp]. These hard scatterings are still present in the heavy-ion data, but resulting distributions are found to be modified due to medium interactions. Thus, understanding modifications to the high-pT particle distributions can lead to qualitative conclusions on the energy loss mechanisms within the medium. As the unmodified (vacuum fragmentation) distributions of high-pT particles are known from elementary p+p collisions, comparative analysis provides a distinct advantage for hard sector studies.

Deviation from the p+p expectation could be expressed through the nuclear modification factor, RAA (Eqn. [\ref=eqn:RAA]). Eqn. [\ref=eqn:RAA] reflects the expectation that the high-pT particle distributions should follow directly from p+p collisions, scaled by the number of binary (nucleon-nucleon) collisions, Nbin. For perfect binary scaling, a value of RAA = 1 would be expected. For RAA < 1 the spectra is referred to as suppressed, whilst RAA > 1 corresponds to an enhancement.

[formula]

Two experimentally observed modifications are noted Cronin enhancement [\cite=cite:STAR_Id200dAupp] [\cite=cite:CroninEffect] (present in d+Au and peripheral Au+Au collisions) and jet quenching (in central Au+Au collisions). The former is believed to be due to multiple nucleon scattering within the nucleus and the latter due to interactions with the hot, dense medium. Neither of these are clearly understood thus require further experimental and theoretical study.

The study of high-pT particles is clearly an important step toward understanding medium effects in heavy-ion collisions. More information can be gleaned, however, by connecting such studies with which type of partons are propagating through the medium. Such information cannot be obtained in the heavy-ion environment on an event-by-event basis or on the jet level, but can be done on a statistical basis by considering an ensemble of events. To tag, statistically, gluon or quark partons, one can use protons (baryons) or pions (mesons). Pion production is readily attributed to quark jets by considering the breaking of strings. It is energetically favorable to produce a q pair rather than a qq needed for baryon production in this regime. Gluon jets are known to have a softer fragmentation function and thus, for the same energy as a given quark jet, need to produce more particles or heavier particles. Identified proton and π measurements from p+p collisions concur with this picture [\cite=cite:STAR_Id200dAupp] [\cite=cite:STAR_Id200AuAu]. Thus, identified particle measurements can then be used to obtain information of gluon and quark propagation through the medium and to probe the color-charge differences of energy loss [\cite=cite:STAR_Id200AuAu] [\cite=cite:Theory_Vitev] [\cite=cite:STAR_62Id] [\cite=cite:STAR_BedangaProc].

In order to systematically test the effects observed in Au+Au collisions at RHIC, several test experiments have been performed. The first one was the collision of d+Au nuclei to probe nuclear effects on the particle production without the hot, dense medium of Au+Au collisions. The second test, the focus of these proceedings, is the collision of much smaller nuclei, Cu+Cu, to gain a greater understanding of peripheral collisions. The size of Cu+Cu nucleus are ideally suited to explore the turn-on of the high-pT suppression and bridge the gap between d+Au and peripheral Au+Au data in terms of system size.

Analysis Methods

Particle identification at low-pT is attained by use of the ionization energy loss in the TPC [\cite=cite:STAR_TPC_NIM]. For low momentum particles 0.2 < pT < 1.2 GeV/ c, a clear mass separation is observed, Fig. [\ref=fig:PIDBands]a, allowing the identification of π±, K± and (anti)protons. In the intermediate-pT region (1 < pT < 3 GeV/ c) the TPC is no longer directly usable, as all particles, independent of mass, are minimum ionizing. In this region, the Time of Flight (ToF) system is employed to identify particle species up to 3 GeV/ c in transverse momentum. Clear particle bands appear for ToF data in this kinematic region and allow for a direct identification of particle species. At higher momenta, where charged pions, kaons and protons and anti-protons are not separable into clear bands, the relativistic rise of the ionization energy loss in the TPC is exploited to statistically identify particles. Here, for a given slice in transverse momentum, a distinctly non-single-gaussian shape can be seen, Fig. [\ref=fig:PIDBands]b, representing the different energy losses of π, K and protons. The quantity used to express the energy loss is a normalized distribution, nσ defined in Eqn. [\ref=eqn:Nsigma], which accounts for the theoretical expectation (Bπ) and the resolution of the TPC for pions.

[formula]

We fit this distribution with a triple gaussian (one per particle), where the widths and single-gaussian centroids are constrained. The yield of charged kaons is obtained by two complementary methods: bin counting and a direct measurement of K0S. Once obtained, this kaon yield is fixed in the fitting procedure of nσ. Further details of the analysis techniques can be found in Refs. [\cite=cite:STAR_Id200dAupp] [\cite=cite:STAR_ToF].

Results

As discussed in the introduction, the medium modification to the spectra can be described by the nuclear modification factor, RAA, defined in Eqn. [\ref=eqn:RAA]. The modification to the pion spectra for Cu+Cu data, Fig. [\ref=fig:PionRAA]a, show a suppression relative to the expectation from binary collision scaled p+p data at high-pT for the most central data. The most peripheral collisions show an enhancement in the high-pT region. These results are commensurate with the Au+Au results at an equivalent number of participants, fitting consistently into the Npart systematics, Fig. [\ref=fig:PionRAA]b. The smooth dependence of the nuclear modification factor could be explained as a consequence of medium induced energy loss of partons traversing the hot, dense medium. For the smaller systems sizes, either peripheral Au+Au or Cu+Cu data, the path length traversed is smaller (on average) than for the larger system (central Au+Au). A smaller energy loss is thus predicted [\cite=cite:Theory_Vitev] as observed in the data. This detailed prescription determined that RAA scales with the number of participants, a phenomenon that is evident in other aspects of the data, discussed later in these proceedings.

Another dramatic effect observed in Au+Au data is the relative enhancement of protons to pions in the intermediate-pT region as compared to p+p and e+ + e- collisions [\cite=cite:STAR_Id200AuAu] and similarly for other baryons and mesons [\cite=cite:STAR_LambdaK0]. This enhancement is found to be strongly dependent on the centrality of the collision, as illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:BaryonEnhancement]a. Peripheral Au+Au data or d+Au data are found to have baryon to meson ratios similar to that in the elementary collision systems. For more central data, the relative number of baryons produced is found to increase rapidly in the intermediate-pT region, with a peak at p[formula]GeV/c. For high-pT particles (p[formula]GeV/c) the enhancement disappears, with data from all centralities similar to the p+p data. Similarly to our π RAA observations, the baryon to meson ratio ((p + ) / (π+  +  π-)) is found to be similar in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions for an equivalent number of participants. Such systematic agreement between these data points to the system size (Npart) driving the distributions. Although, it has to be pointed out that the number of binary collisions for the available centrality bins of Au+Au and Cu+Cu data are also similar for the same Npart values.

Discussion

To interpret the presented results one has to look to models for guidance. As discussed earlier, it is found that baryons are produced with a larger contribution from gluon fragmentation than from quark fragmentation. It is thus expected that any increase in the baryon to meson ratio in the intermediate- to high-pT range would be resultant from this source. To explain the presented data one could consider, for example, that a gluon jet could be more easily propagated through the medium than a quark jet, leading to the increase in the number of protons in the intermediate-pT region. This, however contradicts theoretical predictions where an opposite effect was expected [\cite=cite:Theory_Vitev]. Alternatively, more gluon jets could be initially produced, or induced, for the more central data. The latter appears to be the more plausible, as the highest-pT data exhibits little or no enhancement over the p+p data, indicating a similar energy loss for gluons and quarks, see Fig. [\ref=fig:BaryonEnhancement]. Alternative approaches to explain the phenomenon observed in the data, have also been developed. For example, the recombination/fragmentation picture of thermal/shower partons has had success at describing this data [\cite=cite:HwaRecombination].

Further information on the relative energy loss of quark and gluon jets can be extracted from the data by comparing the nuclear modification factors of proton and pion data, Fig. [\ref=fig:BaryonEnhancement]b. Here we use the most peripheral Au+Au collisions in the ratio as an approximation for p+p collisions [\cite=cite:STAR_Id200AuAu]. As expected from the baryon to meson ratio, the precise shapes of the RCP is not the same for the two, most notably in the intermediate-pT region. At high-pT, however, the two suppression factors are found to be the same, indicating that the energy loss of quark and gluon jets may have similar energy loss.

Additional information on the observed enhancement of baryons in Au+Au collisions has come from collisions at a reduced center-of-mass energy of [formula] GeV. The relative baryon enhancement is also observed for this incident energy, although the effect is magnified for the proton over pion, presumably due to higher baryon transport for this lower energy. For the antiproton over pion ratio, the enhancement is lower due to a smaller number of primordial anti-particles being produced [\cite=cite:STAR_62Id]. Although the collision energy is reduced, a suppression of the high-pT hadrons is observed in the nuclear modification factor. At this incident energy, the magnitude of the suppression effect is also increasing as a function of centrality, however the actual suppression is smaller at [formula]GeV than at 200GeV as compared to the same cross-sectional fraction. Explanation of this effect is not trivial as one must consider the fact that the underlying (p+p) spectrum is softer (lower cross-section for high-pT). More detailed discussion on Au+Au collisions at [formula] 62.4GeV can be found in Ref. [\cite=cite:STAR_62Id].

Systematic effects due to the system size are not limited to the high-pT regime. For the bulk particle yields, properties of the chemical and kinetic freeze-out parameters are found to be strongly coupled to the geometrical overlap of the system for a given collision energy. Upon comparing such parameters additionally for different collision energies, a consistent picture of bulk particle production comes to the fore. By comparing, for example, the mean-pT of particle species (Fig. [\ref=fig:Low_pT_vs_Nch]a), or the derived kinetic freeze-out temperature, from blast-wave fits (Fig. [\ref=fig:Low_pT_vs_Nch]b), one observes scaling with the number of charged-hadrons initially produced in the collisions. These observations are invariant on the system size, collision energy and paint a remarkable picture of particle production for the whole of the RHIC program. In a similar fashion to the high-pT results, the Cu+Cu data fit smoothly into the systematics of the Au+Au data.

Conclusions

Measurements of identified protons and pions from low- to high-pT have proven to be a valuable tool in understanding the particle production and energy loss mechanisms in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The suppression of pions at high-pT lead us to conclude that the partons undergo a large energy loss due to a hot, dense medium created during the collisions. Further studies, through the analysis of protons and pions, indicate that the partonic energy loss is similar for both the gluons and quarks. The amount of energy loss suffered by the partons is found to be strongly Npart dependent. For different collision species, the suppression is found to be invariant for the same number of participants. Low-pT  data show similarly simple scaling behaviors as found at high-pT. Mean-pT and freeze-out parameters are found to scale along a common curve for all RHIC energies and collision systems.
