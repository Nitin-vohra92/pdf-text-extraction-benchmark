On the base locus of the linear system of generalized theta functions

Introduction

Let C be a complex smooth projective curve of genus g and let Mr denote the coarse moduli space parametrizing semi-stable rank-r vector bundles with trivial determinant over the curve C. Let L be the determinant line bundle over the moduli space Mr and let [formula] be the Riemann theta divisor in the degree g - 1 component of the Picard variety of C. By [\cite=BNR] there is a canonical isomorphism [formula], under which the natural rational map [formula] is identified with the so-called theta map

[formula]

The underlying set of θ(E) consists of line bundles [formula] with [formula]. For a general semi-stable vector bundle E, θ(E) is a divisor. If [formula], we say that E has no theta divisor. We note that the indeterminacy locus of the theta map θ, i.e., the set of bundles E without theta divisor, coincides with the base locus Br  ⊂  Mr of the linear system |L|.

Over the past years many authors [\cite=A], [\cite=B2], [\cite=He], [\cite=Hi], [\cite=P], [\cite=R], [\cite=S] have studied the base locus Br of |L| and their analogues for the powers |Lk|. For a recent survey of this subject we refer to [\cite=B1].

It is natural to introduce for a curve C the integer r(C) defined as the minimal rank for which there exists a semi-stable rank-r(C) vector bundle with trivial determinant over C without theta divisor (see also [\cite=B1] section 6). It is known [\cite=R] that r(C)  ≥  3 for any curve C and that r(C)  ≥  4 for a generic curve C. Our main result shows the existence of vector bundles of low ranks without theta divisor.

We assume that g  ≥  2. Then we have the following bounds.

r(C)  ≤  g + 2.

r(C)  ≤  4, if C is hyperelliptic.

The first part of the theorem improves the upper bound [formula] given in [\cite=A]. The statements of the theorem are equivalent to the existence of a semi-stable rank-(g + 2) (resp. rank-4) vector bundle without theta divisor -- see section 2.1 (resp. 2.2). The construction of these vector bundles uses ingredients which are already implicit in [\cite=Hi].

Theorem 1.1 seems to hint towards a dependence of the integer r(C) on the curve C.

Notations: If E is a vector bundle over C, we will write Hi(E) for Hi(C,E) and hi(E) for dim Hi(C,E). We denote the slope of E by [formula], the canonical bundle over C by K and the degree d component of the Picard variety of C by [formula].

Proof of Theorem 1.1

Semi-stable rank-(g + 2) vector bundles without theta divisor

We consider a line bundle [formula]. Then L is globally generated, h0(L)  =  g + 2 and the evaluation bundle EL, which is defined by the exact sequence

[formula]

is stable (see e.g. [\cite=Bu]), with deg EL  =  2g + 1, [formula] and [formula].

A cohomology class [formula] determines a rank-(g + 2) vector bundle Ee given as an extension

[formula]

For any non-zero class e, the rank-(g + 2) vector bundle Ee is semi-stable.

Consider a proper subbundle A  ⊂  Ee. If A  ⊂  EL, then [formula] by stability of EL, so the subbundles of EL cannot destabilize Ee. If [formula], we introduce [formula] and consider the exact sequence

[formula]

where D is an effective divisor. If [formula] or S  =  0, we easily conclude that μ(A)  <  μ(Ee) = 2. If [formula] and [formula], then stability of EL gives the inequality [formula]. We introduce the integer [formula]. Then the previous inequality is equivalent to δ  ≥  1. Now we compute

[formula]

which shows the semi-stablity of Ee.

We tensorize the exact sequence [\eqref=es1] with L and take the cohomology

[formula]

Note that [formula] by stability of EL. The second map μ is the multiplication map and factorizes through [formula], i.e.,

[formula]

By Serre duality a cohomology class [formula] can be viewed as a hyperplane [formula]. Then we have the following

If Λ2H0(L)  ⊂  He, then the vector bundle Ee satisfies

[formula]

We tensorize the exact sequence [\eqref=es2] with [formula] and take the cohomology

[formula]

Since deg LK- 1λ  =  g, we can write LK- 1λ  =  OC(D) for some effective divisor D. It is enough to show that [formula] holds for λ general. Hence we can assume that h0(LK- 1λ)  =  h0(OC(D))  =  1.

If [formula], we are done. So we assume [formula], which implies [formula] by Riemann-Roch. Hence we obtain that [formula] if and only if the cup product map

[formula]

is zero. Furthermore [formula] is zero if and only if [formula]. Now we will show the inclusion

[formula]

We tensorize the exact sequence [\eqref=es1] with L( - D) and take cohomology

[formula]

Since [formula], we conclude that h0(L( - D))  =  2 and [formula].

Finally the proposition follows: if Λ2H0(L)  ⊂  He, then by [\eqref=inclusionD] [formula] for general D, or equivalently [formula] for general [formula].

We introduce the linear subspace [formula] defined by

[formula]

which has dimension [formula]. Then for any non-zero cohomology class e∈Γ and any [formula] satisfying γg + 2  =  L2K- 1  =   det Ee, the rank-(g + 2) vector bundle

[formula]

has trivial determinant, is semi-stable by Proposition 2.1 and has no theta divisor by Proposition 2.2.

Hyperelliptic curves

In this subsection we assume that C is hyperelliptic and we denote by σ the hyperelliptic involution. The construction of a semi-stable rank-4 vector bundle without theta divisor has been given in [\cite=Hi] section 6 in the case g = 2, but it can be carried out for any g  ≥  2 without major modification. For the convenience of the reader, we recall the construction and refer to [\cite=Hi] for the details and the proofs.

Let w∈C be a Weierstrass point. Any non-trivial extension

[formula]

is a stable, σ-invariant, rank-2 vector bundle with deg G  =   - 1. By [\cite=Hi] Theorem 4 a cohomology class [formula] determines a symplectic rank-4 bundle

[formula]

Moreover it is easily seen that, for any non-zero class e, the vector bundle Ee is semi-stable. By [\cite=Hi] Lemma 16 the composite map

[formula]

is the projectivization of a linear map

[formula]

The involution i(L)  =  KL- 1 on [formula] induces a linear involution on |4Θ| with eigenspaces |4Θ|±. Note that 4Θ∈|4Θ|+. We now observe that θ(E)∈|4Θ|+ for any symplectic rank-4 vector bundle E -- see e.g. [\cite=B2]. Moreover we have the equality θ(σ*E)  =  i*θ(E) for any vector bundle E. These two observations imply that the linear map [formula] is equivariant with respect to the induced involutions σ and i. Since [formula], we obtain that one of the two eigenspaces [formula] is contained in the kernel [formula], hence give base points for the theta map. We now compute as in [\cite=Hi] using the Atiyah-Bott-fixed-point formula

[formula]

One can work out that [formula]. Hence any Ee with non-zero [formula] is a semi-stable rank-4 vector bundle without theta divisor.
