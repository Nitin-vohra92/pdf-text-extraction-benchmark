The [formula]-homology of even Coxeter groups

Introduction

The following conjecture is attributed to Singer.

Singer's conjecture holds for elementary reasons in dimensions ≤  2. Indeed, top-dimensional cycles on manifolds are constant on each component, so a square-summable cycle on an infinite component is constant 0. As a result, Conjecture [\ref=conj:singer] in dimension ≤  2 follows from Poincaré duality. In [\cite=LL], Lott and Lück proved that it holds for those aspherical 3-manifolds for which Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture is true. (Hence, by Parelman, all aspherical 3-manifolds.) For details on [formula]-homology theory, see [\cite=davismoussong], [\cite=do2] and [\cite=eckmann].

Let S be a finite set of generators. A Coxeter matrix on S is a symmetric S  ×  S matrix M = (mst) with entries in [formula] such that each diagonal entry is 1 and each off diagonal entry is ≥  2. The matrix M gives a presentation for an associated Coxeter group W:

[formula]

The pair (W,S) is called a Coxeter system. Denote by L the nerve of (W,S). In several papers (e.g., [\cite=davisannals], [\cite=davisbook], and [\cite=davismoussong]), M. Davis describes a construction which associates to any Coxeter system (W,S), a simplicial complex Σ(W,S), or simply Σ when the Coxeter system is clear, on which W acts properly and cocompactly. The two salient features of Σ are that (1) it is contractible and (2) it admits a cellulation under which the nerve of each vertex is L. It follows that if L is a triangulation of [formula], Σ is an n-manifold. There is a special case of Singer's conjecture for such manifolds.

In [\cite=do2], Davis and Okun prove that if Conjecture [\ref=conj:singerc] for right-angled Coxeter systems is true in some odd dimension n, then it is also true for right-angled systems in dimension n + 1. (A Coxeter system is right-angled if generators either commute or have no relation.) They also show that Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture holds for these Davis 3-manifolds arising from right-angled Coxeter systems. Hence, the Lott and Lück result implies that Conjecture [\ref=conj:singerc] for right-angled Coxeter systems is true for n = 3 and, therefore, also for n = 4. (Davis and Okun also show that Andreev's theorem, [\cite=andreev2], implies Conjecture [\ref=conj:singerc] in dimension 3 for right-angled systems. In fact, using methods similar to those in [\cite=do2], one can show that Andreev's theorem implies [\ref=conj:singerc] for arbitrary Coxeter systems.)

Right-angled Coxeter systems are specific examples of even Coxeter systems. We say a Coxeter system is even if for any two generators s  ≠  t, (st)mst = 1 implies that mst is even. The purpose of this paper is to prove the following:

In order to prove Theorem [\ref=t:main], we define a certain subspace Ω of Σ, and its boundary ∂Ω. We call the pair (Ω,∂Ω) a ruin. We then subdivide Ω into subspaces we call "boundary collars," which are isomorphic to [formula], where B is a component of ∂Ω. We paint these boundary collars finitely many colors, which can be categorized as even or odd. The painting of Ω is virtually invariant under the group action on Ω. Moreover, the intersection of two even colors is 2-acyclic and the intersection of an odd color with all the evens is acyclic. Then using Mayer-Vietoris, we are able to prove that [formula] for [formula].

Next, we prove that for any V  ⊆  S, and any t∈V, [formula], where WV is the subgroup of W generated by the elements of V. It follows from induction and Poincaré duality that [\ref=t:main] is true.

Coxeter systems and the complex Σ

Coxeter systems.

Given a subset U of S, define WU to be the subgroup of W generated by the elements of U. (WU,U) is a Coxeter system. A subset T of S is spherical if WT is a finite subgroup of W. In this case, we will also say that the subgroup WT is spherical. We say the Coxeter system (W,S) is even if for any s,t∈S with s  ≠  t, mst is either even or infinite.

Given w∈W, we call an expression [formula] reduced if there does not exist an integer m < n with [formula]. Define the length of w, or l(w), to be the integer n such that [formula], si∈S, is a reduced expression for w. Denote by S(w) the set of elements of S which comprise a reduced expression for w. This set is well-defined, [\cite=davisbook].

For T  ⊆  S and w∈W, the coset wWT contains a unique element of minimal length. This element is said to be [formula]-reduced. Moreover, it is shown in [\cite=bourbaki], that an element is [formula]-reduced if and only if l(wt) > l(w) for all t∈T. Likewise, we can define the [formula]-reduced elements to be those w such that l(tw) > l(w) for all t∈T. So given X,Y  ⊆  S, we say an element w∈W is (X,Y)-reduced if it is both [formula]-reduced and [formula]-reduced.

Shortening elements of W. We have the so-called "Exchange" (E) condition for Coxeter systems ([\cite=bourbaki] or [\cite=davisbook]):

(E) Given a reduced expression [formula] and an element s∈S, either [formula] or there is an index i such that

[formula]

In the case of even Coxeter systems, the parity of a given generator in the set expressions for an element of W is well-defined. (We prove this herein, Lemma [\ref=l:T-hom].) So, in (), si = s; i.e, if an element of s∈S shortens a given element of W, it does so by deleting an instance of s in an expression for w.

It is also a fact about Coxeter groups ([\cite=davisbook]) that if two reduced expressions represent the same element, then one can be transformed into the other by replacing alternating subwords of the form [formula] of length mst by the alternating word [formula] of length mst. The proof of the first of the following two lemmas follows immediately from this.

Suppose that w is a counterexample of minimum length. w cannot start with an element of Ust, since if it did, multiplication on the left by this element would produce a shorter counterexample. Nor can w begin with s, since by the exchange condition, multiplication on the left by s would cancel an s in w', producing a shorter counterexample. Therefore, w must start with some r which either does not commute with t or does not commute with s. By minimality we may also assume that every element appearing after r in w is from [formula].

If r does not commute with t, then by [\ref=l:onereduction], r appears to the left of t in any reduced expression for wtv; a contradiction to tstw' = wtv. If r does commute with t but does not commute with s, then multiply both sides of tstw' = wtv by t leaving stw' = w''sv' (reduced) where w'' begins with r, [formula] and s∉S(w''). Then, with t in [\ref=l:onereduction] replaced by s, we have that r appears to the left of s in any reduced expression for wtv; a contradiction to stw' = w''sv'.

The complex Σ.

Let (W,S) be an arbitrary Coxeter system. Denote by S the poset of spherical subsets of S, partially ordered by inclusion. Given a subset V of S, let S< V: = {T∈S|T  ⊂  V}. Similar definitions exist for > ,  ≤  ,  ≥  . For any w∈W and T∈S, we call the coset wWT a spherical coset. The poset of all spherical cosets we will denote by WS.

The poset [formula] is an abstract simplicial complex, denote it by L, and call it the nerve of (W,S). The vertex set of L is S and a non-empty subset of vertices T spans a simplex of L if and only if T is spherical.

Let K = |S|, the geometric realization of the poset S. It is the cone on the barycentric subdivision of L, the cone point corresponding to the empty set, thus a finite simplicial complex. Denote by Σ(W,S), or simply Σ when the system is clear, the geometric realization of the poset WS. This is the Davis complex. The natural action of W on WS induces a simplicial action of W on Σ which is proper and cocompact. K includes naturally into Σ via the map induced by T  →  WT, so we view K as a subcomplex of Σ and note that it is a strict fundamental domain for the action of W on Σ.

For any element w∈W, write wK for the w-translate of K in Σ. Let w,w'∈W and consider [formula]. This intersection is non-empty if and only if V = S(w- 1w) is a spherical subset. In fact, [formula] is simplicially isomorphic to [formula], the geometric realization of [formula].

A cubical structure on Σ. For each w∈W, T∈S, denote by wS≤  T the subposet {wWV|V  ⊆  T} of WS. Put [formula]. |wS≤  T| has the combinatorial structure of a subdivision of an n-cube. We identify the sub-simplicial complex |wS≤  T| of Σ with this coarser cubical structure and call it a cube of type T. Note that the vertices of these cubes correspond to spherical subsets V∈S≤  T. (For details on this cubical structure, see [\cite=moussong].)

A cellulation of Σ by Coxeter cells. Σ has a coarser cell structure: its cellulation by "Coxeter cells." (For reference, see [\cite=davisbook],[\cite=do2], and [\cite=ddjo].) Suppose that T∈S; then by definition WT is finite. Take the canonical representation of WT on [formula] and choose a point x in the interior of a fundamental chamber. The Coxeter cell of type T is defined as the convex hull C, in [formula], of WTx (a generic WT-orbit). The vertices of C are in 1-1 correspondence with the elements of WT. Furthermore, a subset of these vertices is the vertex set of a face of C if and only if it corresponds to the set of elements in a coset of the form wWV, where w∈WT and V  ⊂  T. Hence, the poset of non-empty faces of C is naturally identified with the poset WTS≤  T: = {wWV|w∈WT,V  ⊂  T}. Therefore, we can identify the simplicial complex Σ(WT,T) with the barycentric subdivision of the Coxeter cell of type T.

Now, for each T∈S(k) and w∈W, the poset WS≤  wWT is isomorphic to the poset WTS≤  T via the map vWV  →  w- 1vWV. Thus, the subcomplex of Σ(W,S) which is obtained from the poset WS≤  wWT may be identified with the barycentric subdivision of the k-cell of type T. In this way, we put a cell structure on Σ which is coarser than the simplicial structure by identifying each simplicial subcomplex |WS≤  wWT| with a cell of type T.

We will write Σcc, when necessary, to denote the Davis complex equipped with this cellulation by Coxeter cells. Under this cellulation, the 0-cells of Σcc correspond to cosets of [formula], i.e. to elements from W; and 1-cells correspond to cosets of Ws, s∈S. The features of this cellulation are summarized by the following, from [\cite=davisbook].

There is a natural cell structure on Σ so that

its vertex set is W, its 1-skeleton is the Cayley graph of (W,S) and its 2-skeleton is a Cayley 2-complex.

each cell is a Coxeter cell.

the link of each vertex is isomorphic to L (the nerve of (W,S)) and so if L is a triangulation of [formula], Σ is a topological n-manifold.

a subset of W is the vertex set of a cell if and only if it is a spherical coset and

the poset of cells is WS.

Ruins.

The following subspaces are defined in [\cite=ddjo]. Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system. For any U  ⊆  S, let S(U) = {T∈S|T  ⊂  U} and let Σ(U) be the subcomplex of Σcc consisting of all cells of type T, with T∈S(U).

Given T∈S(U), define three subcomplexes of Σ(U):

[formula]

The pair (Ω(U,T),∂Ω(U,T)) is called the (U,T)-ruin. For [formula], we have [formula] and [formula].

The subspace Ω. Let t∈S. We call the (S,t)-ruin a one-letter ruin. Put U: = {s∈S|mst  <    ∞  }. The path components of Ω(S,t) are indexed by the cosets W / WU. Denote by Ω the path-component of Ω(S,t) with vertex set corresponding WU. The action of WU on Σ restricts to an action on Ω. Let [formula] and put [formula]. Note that the WU-translates of K(U) cover Ω, i.e. [formula].

If we restrict our attention to cubes of type T, where T  ⊆  T' for some T'∈S≥  t, Ω is a cubical complex and ∂Ω is a subcomplex. Moreover, if B is a component of ∂Ω, the space [formula] is isomorphic to the union of the w-translates of K(U) where w is a vertex of B. We call such subspaces boundary collars. It is clear that the collection of boundary collars covers Ω. We denote by ∂in(D) the "1-end" of this product and note that it is comprised of 0-simplices corresponding to elements of S≥  t. The boundary collars intersect along these "inner" boundaries.

The [formula]-homology of Ω(S,t)

Here and for the remainder of the paper, we require that (W,S) be an even Coxeter system whose nerve L is a flag triangulation of [formula]. Fix t∈S and let U, Ω and ∂Ω be defined as in [\ref=s:coxeter].

Any s∈U has the property that mst  <    ∞  . Let S': = {s∈U|mst > 2}, and assume that S' is not empty. The group WU has the following properties.

Suppose that s  ≠  s' and that mss'  <    ∞  . Then {s,s'}∈S, and since s,s' are both in U, the vertices corresponding to s, s' and t are pairwise connected in L. L is a flag complex, so this implies that {s,s',t}∈S. But

[formula]

This contradicts {s,s',t} being a spherical subset. So we must have that mss'  =    ∞  .

Let Lst denote the link in L of the edge corresponding to the vertices s and t. The above Corollary states that the generators corresponding to the vertex set of Lst commute with both s and t. Denote this set of generators by Ust.

Of particular interest to us will be elements of WU with a reduced expression of the form [formula] for some s∈S'. Since W is even, this expression is unique, and we have the following Lemma.

We show that gVT respects the relations in WV. Let s,u∈V be such that (su)m = 1. Then In all cases, since (WV,V) is even, gT((su)m) = e.

Then with T∈S≥  t and U as above, we define an action of WU on the set of cosets WT / WT - t: For w∈WU and v∈WT, define

[formula]

Coloring boundary collars.

Set We call A the set of colors, note that it is a finite set. The action defined in ([\ref=e:action]) extends to a diagonal WU-action on A. So for w∈WU and a∈A, write w  ·  a to denote w acting on a. Let ē be the element of A defined by taking the trivial coset WT - t for each T∈S≥  t. Vertices of Ω correspond to group elements of WU, so we paint the vertices of Ω by defining a map c:WU  →  A with the rule c(w): = w  ·  ē.

If an element w∈WU contains no t's in any of its reduced expressions, then w acts trivially on the element ē, i.e. w  ·  ē  =  ē.

We will paint the space wK(U) with c(w). In this way, all of Ω is colored by some element of A. For vertices w and w' of the same component B of ∂Ω, h = w- 1w'∈WU - t. So c(w') = c(wh) = wh  ·  ē = w  ·  ē = c(w), and therefore all of [formula] is painted with c(w). Note that each component of ∂Ω is monochromatic while ∂in(D) is not.

Suppose, by way of contradiction, that [formula], i.e. there exist vertices w∈B, w'∈B' such that c(w) = c(w') and [formula]. Let V = S(w- 1w') and v = w- 1w'. Then c(w) = c(w')  ⇒  w  ·  ē = wv  ·  ē  ⇒  ē = v  ·  ē. Thus, for any T∈S≥  t, we have that

[formula]

[formula] is spherical, and since v∈WV, the action of v on [formula] defined in ([\ref=e:action]) is left multiplication by v. So by ([\ref=e:h]), we have that v∈WV - t. But this contradicts w and w' coming from different components of ∂Ω.

Then for c∈A, define the c-collars, Fc, to be the disjoint union of the boundary collars [formula] where each component B of ∂Ω has the color c. We refer to these collections as colors. The collection of colors is a finite cover of Ω.

Even and odd colors.

Let T = {t} and consider the homomorphism gUT:WU  →  Wt defined in ([\ref=l:T-hom]). Under gUT, an element w∈WU is sent to the identity in Wt if w has an even number of t's present in some factorization (and therefore, all factorizations) as a product of generators from U and an element w∈WU is sent to t∈Wt if w has an odd number of t's present in some factorization. Thus, we call a vertex w even if gUT(w) = e; odd if gUT(w) = t. If two vertices w and w' are such that c(w) = c(w'), then clearly gUT(w) = gUT(w'). So we may also classify the colors (both the elements of A and the collections of boundary collars), as even or odd. We will suppress the subscript c and say a color F is even or odd.

Of fundamental importance will be how these colors intersect. By Remark [\ref=r:trivial], we know that in order for the vertices of a Coxeter cell to support two different colors, this cell must be of type T∈S≥  t. But, for a cell to support two different even vertices, v and v', this cell must be of type T∈S≥  {s,t} for exactly one s∈S' (uniqueness is given by Corollary [\ref=c:commute]). Moreover, w = v- 1v' has the properties that {s,t}  ⊆  S(w) and that it contains at least two, and an even number of t's in any factorization as a product of generators. We call such w t-even.

The following example is representative of our situation. Suppose [formula], and U = {t,r,s|(rt)2 = 1,(st)4 = 1}. Ω is represented in Figure [\ref=fig:ruincolors9]. The black dots represent the vertices of the Coxeter cellulation, with the vertices e and tst labeled. The even colors are shaded. Even boundary collars intersect in a 0-simplex corresponding to the spherical subset {s,t}. The intersection of one odd color and all evens is the inner boundary of the odd color.

The intersection of even colors. Let D0 denote the boundary collar containing the vertex e. Fix s∈S' and let D2 denote the boundary collar containing the vertex u, where u∈W{s,t} is t-even and has a reduced expression ending in t. We study [formula].

For any w∈W', the vertex w is in the same component of ∂Ω as e, and therefore wK(U)  ⊂  D0. wu = uw, so wu is in the same component of ∂Ω as u and wuK(U)  ⊂  D2. Thus [formula].

Now let σ be a 0-simplex in [formula]. Then there exist w,w'∈WU - t such that [formula], i.e. σ is simultaneously the w- and uw'-translate of a 0-simplex σ' in K(U). Let V be the spherical subset to which σ' corresponds and let v∈WV be such that uw' = wv. c(e) = c(w) and c(u) = c(uw'), so w and uw' are differently colored even vertices of a cell of type V. Thus {s',t}  ⊆  S(v)  ⊆  V for exactly one s'∈S' and v is t-even.

Claim 1: s' = s. Pf of Claim 1: Since w'∈WU - t, c(u) = c(uw') = c(wv), i.e. u and wv act the same on every coordinate of ē. Consider the {s,t}-coordinate. u∈W{s,t} is t-even, so u  ·  Ws = uWs and uWs  ≠  Ws. But if s∉S(v), then v being t-even and w∈WU - t imply that wv  ·  Ws = Ws; which contradicts u and wv having the same color. So Claim 1 is true, and as a result V∈S≥  {s,t} and σ'∈K'. It remains to show that σ is in the W'-orbit of K'.

Claim 2: [formula]. Pf of Claim 2: Take a reduced expression for u which ends in t. If this expression begins with s, multiply u on the left by s, so that we have suw' = swv. The only change this can effect on S(w) is by either adding or subtracting an s, which is inconsequential to our claim. So, we may assume that u has a reduced expression of the form [formula] as described in Lemma [\ref=l:XY-reduced]. Hence, u is (U - t,U - t)-reduced and uw' has a reduced expression beginning with the subword tst. v is t-even, so wv has a reduced expression of the form wtv' where w∈WU - t and [formula]. Claim 2 then follows from Lemma [\ref=l:reduction].

We now finish the proof of [\ref=l:W'-orbit]. If s∉S(w), then w∈W' and we are done since σ is the w-translate of σ'. If s∈S(w), then w may be written as qs, with q∈W' and since s∈V, qsWV = qWV. So σ is also the q-translate of σ'.

[formula], an infinite connected 2-manifold.

Since S(u) = {s,t}, K' is the geometric realization of the poset S≥  {s,t}  =  {V∈S|{s,t}  ⊆  V}. By Lemma [\ref=l:W'-orbit], [formula], and by Corollary [\ref=c:commute], S≥  {s,t} is isomorphic to S(Ust) via the map T  →  T - {s,t}. So [formula].

Simplices in Lst correspond to spherical subsets T∈S such that neither s nor t is contained in T but [formula]. So by Corollary [\ref=c:commute], the vertex set of a simplex of Lst corresponds to a spherical subset of S(Ust). Conversely, given a spherical subset T∈S(Ust), [formula], which is finite. So T corresponds to a simplex of Lst. Thus, Lst is the nerve of the system (W',Ust). Since L triangulates [formula], Lst triangulates [formula]. The result follows from Proposition [\ref=p:coxeter].

Suppose that F  ≠  F' are both even colors such that [formula]. Then there exist even vertices v and v' with [formula]. Let w = v- 1v' and put T = S(v- 1v'). T is a spherical subset, and v and v' are both vertices of a cell of type T. So we have exactly one s∈S' with {s,t}  ⊂  T. Factor w as w = xq where x∈W{s,t} is t-even and q∈WT - {s,t}. Now, x may not have a reduced expression ending in t. If it does not, then xs does and it is in the same boundary collar as x and w. So let

[formula]

Then [formula]. Act on the left by v- 1 and we are in the situation studied in [\ref=l:W'-orbit] and [\ref=p:W'-Daviscpx]. So [formula] is the disjoint union of infinite connected 2-manifolds. As a result, any 2-cycle must be constant 0.

If [formula], then WU = WU - t  ×  Wt and there is one even color and one odd color.

Multiple even colors. Suppose that [formula] are even boundary collars. Then and suppose that for some 1  ≤  i < k  ≤  n we have that [formula] is not disjoint. Let σ be a 0-simplex contained in [formula] corresponding to a coset of the form vWT. Then there exists w,w'∈WT such that v∈De, vw∈Di, vw'∈Dk and [formula]. These three vertices are differently colored even vertices of a cell of type T, so {s,t}  ⊆  T for exactly one s∈S' and both w and w' are t-even. Then, as in the proof of [\ref=c:H22evens], it follows that [formula]. So Corollary [\ref=c:H22evens] generalizes to the following:

Since Fo is a disjoint union of boundary collars, it suffices to show that [formula] for some boundary collar D  ⊂  Fo.

(⊇  ): Let σ be a 0-simplex in ∂in(D). Then σ corresponds to a coset of the form wWV where V∈S≥  t and w∈WU is an odd vertex of D. Consider the even vertex wt. Then since t∈V, wWV = wtWV, and σ∈wtK(U)  ⊂  FE.

(⊆  ): Now suppose that σ is a 0-simplex contained in [formula]. Then there exists a spherical subset V and cosets wWV = w'WV where w is odd and w' is even. Let v = w- 1w'. Since w is odd and w' is even, v must contain an odd number of t's in any of its reduced expressions. Therefore t∈V and σ∈∂in(D).

As before, let FE denote the union of all even colors, and now let FO denote the union of a sub-collection of the odd colors. Let [formula] and let Fo be an odd color not in FO. Then by [\ref=l:oneodd], Any 0-simplex in Fo which is also in a different color must be of the form wWV, where w is a vertex of Fo and V∈S≥  T. Therefore [formula] and [formula].

It is clear from the product structure on boundary collars that [formula], the latter a disjoint collection of components of ∂Ω. Since L is flag, we have a 1-1 correspondence between cells of any component of ∂Ω and cells of Σ(WU - t,U - t)cc. Denote by Lt the link in L of the vertex corresponding to t, it is a triangulation of [formula] and it is isomorphic to the nerve of (WU - t,U - t). Then since Conjecture [\ref=conj:singerc] is true in dimension 3,

[formula]

for all i.

Let (W,S) be an even Coxeter system whose nerve, L is a flag triangulation of [formula]. Let t∈S. Then [formula] for [formula].

We first show that H4(Ω,∂Ω) = 0. Consider the long exact sequence of the pair (Ω,∂Ω):

[formula]

Ω is a 4-dimensional manifold with boundary, so H4(Ω) = 0 and H3(∂Ω) = 0. So by exactness, H4(Ω,∂Ω) = 0.

Let FE' denote the union of a collection of even colors or the union of all evens and a collection of odd colors. Let F be a color not contained in FE' (if FE' is not all the even colors, require that F be an even color). Let [formula] and let [formula]. Note that [formula] and consider the relative Mayer-Vietoris sequence of the pair [formula]:

[formula]

Assume that H3(FE',∂E') = 0. Each color retracts onto its boundary, so H3(F,∂F) = 0. If F is even, then the last term vanishes by [\ref=c:H2evens], if F is odd, then the last term vanishes by ([\ref=e:multipleodds]). In either case, exactness implies that [formula]. It follows from induction that H3(Ω,∂Ω) = 0.

The [formula]-homology of Σ

If [formula], then Ω(V,T) does not contain 4-dimensional cells, and we are done. So assume that [formula]. The codimension 1 faces of 4-cells of Ω(V,T) are either faces of one other 4-cell in Ω(V,T) (Σ is a 4-manifold), or they are free faces, i.e they are not faces of any other 4-cell in Ω(V,T).

Suppose that cells of type T'∈S(V)(4)> T have a co-dimension one face of type F which is a face of another 4-cell in Ω(V,T) of type T''. Then any relative 4-cycle must be constant on adjacent cells of type T' and T'', where [formula], and [formula], for some R∈S(V)(3) and r,s∈V. Since L is flag and 3-dimensional, mrs  =    ∞  . So in this case, there is a sequence of adjacent 4-cells with vertex sets [formula]. Hence, this constant must be 0.

Now suppose that for a given 4-cell of Ω(V,T), every co-dimension one face is free. This cell has faces not contained in ∂Ω(V,T), so relative 4-cycles cannot be supported on this cell.

Let V  ⊆  S, be arbitrary; T  ⊆  V spherical, Ω: = Ω(V,T), ∂Ω: = ∂Ω(V,T). Recall that Σ(V) is the subcomplex of Σcc consisting of cells of type T', with T'  ⊆  V. We have excision isomorphisms from [\cite=ddjo]:

[formula]

and for any s∈T and T': = T - s,

[formula]

Set [formula], and [formula]. Consider the long, weakly exact sequence of the triple (Σ(V),:

[formula]

By ([\ref=e:excision1]) and ([\ref=e:excision2]), the left hand term excises to the homology of the (V - s,T')-ruin, the right hand term to that of the (V,T)-ruin and the middle term to that of the (V,T')-ruin; leaving the sequence:

[formula]

Let (W,S) be an even Coxeter system, whose nerve L is a flag triangulation of [formula]. Let V  ⊆  S and t∈V. Then

[formula]

for [formula].

It is clear that [formula] for [formula] whenever [formula], so we may assume that [formula]. We show ([\ref=e:one-letter]) by induction on [formula], Proposition [\ref=p:H3] [\ref=4(S)=0] giving us the base case. Let [formula] and t∈V'. Assume ([\ref=e:one-letter]) holds for V. If mst  =    ∞   then Ω(V',t) = Ω(V,t) and we are done. Otherwise, consider the sequence in ([\ref=e:ruinsequence]), taking T = {s,t}, T' = {t}:

[formula]

[formula] for [formula] by assumption and H4(Ω(V,{s,t}),∂) = 0 by [\ref=l:H4-2letter]. So by exactness, H4(Ω(V',t),∂) = 0.

Let V  ⊆  S and t∈V. Consider the following form of ([\ref=e:ruinsequence]), where T = {t}:

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=p:one-letter], [formula] for [formula]. So by exactness,

[formula]

for [formula]. It follows that [formula] for [formula] and hence, by Poincaré duality, [formula] for [formula].
