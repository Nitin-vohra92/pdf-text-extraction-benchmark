INTRODUCTION

Let L be a non-empty set. Define a binary operation (·  ) on L. If x  ·  y∈L for all x,y∈L, (L,  ·  ) is called a groupoid. If the system of equations ; a  ·  x = b and y  ·  a = b have unique solutions for x and y respectively, then (L,  ·  ) is called a quasigroup. Furthermore, if there exists a unique element e∈L called the identity element such that for all x∈L, x  ·  e = e  ·  x = x, (L,  ·  ) is called a loop. A detailed information on loop properties, types, concepts and applications are contained in [\cite=phd3], [\cite=phd41], [\cite=phd39], [\cite=phd49], [\cite=phd42] and [\cite=phd75].

The symmetric group of a loop (L,  ·  ) is denoted by S(L,  ·  ) and it is defined as the group of all permutations or self-bijections on L. The bijection Lx:L  →  L defined as yLx = x  ·  y for all x,y∈L is called a left translation(multiplication) of L while the bijection Rx:L  →  L defined as yRx = y  ·  x for all x,y∈L is called a right translation(multiplication) of L. In a loop (L,  ·  ), the group generated by the set of left or right translations and their inverses is denoted by Mλ(L,  ·  ) or Mρ(L,  ·  ) and called the left or right multiplication group of (L,  ·  ), while the group generated by the set of both left and right translations and their inverses is denoted by M(L,  ·  ) and called the multiplication group of (L,  ·  ). It is well known that the groups Mλ(L,  ·  ),Mρ(L,  ·  ) and M(L,  ·  ) are subgroups of S(L,  ·  ).

The triple (U,V,W) formed such that U,V,W∈S(L,  ·  ) is called an autotopism of L if and only if xU  ·  yV = (x  ·  y)W for all x,y∈L. The group of autotopisms of L is called the autotopism group and it is denoted by AUT(L,  ·  ). If U = V = W, then U is called an automorphism. The group of automorphisms on L is called the automorphism group and it is denoted by A(L,  ·  ). If U∈S(L,  ·  ) such that (U,URc,URc)∈AUT(L,  ·  ) or (ULc,U,ULc)∈AUT(L,  ·  ) for some c∈L, then U is called a right or left pseudo-automorphism of the loop L with a right or left companion c. The group formed by such permutations is called the right or left pseudo-automorphism group and it is denoted by PSρ(L,  ·  ) or PSλ(L,  ·  ).

All elements α∈Mλ(L,  ·  ) or α∈Mρ(L,  ·  ) or α∈M(L,  ·  ) such that eα = e form a group called the left inner mapping group or right inner mapping group or inner mapping group of (L,  ·  ) and this is denoted by λ(L,  ·  ) or ρ(L,  ·  ) or (L,  ·  ).

The inner mapping R(x,y) = RxRyR- 1xy is called a right inner mapping and it has been shown that they generate the group ρ(L,  ·  ). A loop L is called a right A-loop(Aρ-loop) if ρ(L,  ·  )  ≤  A(L,  ·  ).

The inner mapping L(x,y) = LxLyL- 1yx is called a left inner mapping and it has been shown that they generate the group λ(L,  ·  ). A loop L is called a left A-loop(Aλ-loop) if λ(L,  ·  )  ≤  A(L,  ·  ).

The inner mapping T(x) = RxL- 1x is called a middle inner mapping and the group generated by these is denoted by μ(L,  ·  ) and called the middle inner mapping group. A loop L is called a middle A-loop(Aμ-loop) if μ(L,  ·  )  ≤  A(L,  ·  ).

It has been shown in [\cite=phd3] that the inner mapping group (L,  ·  ) of a loop L is generated by its left, right and middle inner mappings. So, if (L,  ·  )  ≤  A(L,  ·  ), L is called an A-loop, hence, L is an A-loop if and only if L is an Aρ-loop, Aλ-loop and an Aμ-loop. The study of A-loops started by Bruck and Paige in [\cite=phd40]. Further studies on A-loops have been done by Osborn [\cite=phd110], Phillips [\cite=phd123] and Drapal [\cite=phd14]. The most interesting work on A-loops is Kinyon et. al. [\cite=phd13] which gives the solution to the Osborn problem.

After the introduction of conjugacy closed loops(CC-loop) by Goodaire and Robinson [\cite=phd91], [\cite=phd48], a tremendous study of their properties and structural behaviours have been studied by Kunen [\cite=phd78] and some recent works of Kinyon and Kunen [\cite=phd36], [\cite=phd47], Phillips et. al. [\cite=phd35], Drápal [\cite=phd37], [\cite=phd38], [\cite=phd98], [\cite=phd139], [\cite=phd107], Csörg o et. al. [\cite=phd106], [\cite=phd104], [\cite=phd108] and Phillips [\cite=phd151]. In [\cite=phd36], [\cite=phd35], [\cite=phd47] and [\cite=phd78], it is proved and stated that in a CC-loop L;

R(x,y),L(x,y)∈A(L), hence L is a both an Aρ-loop and an Aλ-loop,

λ(L) = ρ(L) and [formula],

R(x,y)R(u,v) = R(u,v)R(x,y) and R(x,y)L(u,v) = L(u,v)R(x,y), hence ρ(L) and [formula] are abelian groups.

If L is an extra loop, then the facts listed above and the ones below are true.

R(x,y) = L(x,y) = R(y,x) = L(y,x), |R(x,y)| = 2, hence λ(L) = ρ(L) are boolean groups,

T(x)∈A(L) if and only if x∈N(L).

If L is an A-loop then according to [\cite=phd40], T(x)L(y,x) = L(y,x)T(x) and T(x)R(x,y) = R(x,y)T(x).

The multiplication group and inner mapping group of loops have been studied by Drápal [\cite=phd100], [\cite=phd101], [\cite=phd102], [\cite=phd99], Drápal et. al. [\cite=phd129], [\cite=phd130], Kepka [\cite=phd131], [\cite=phd132], Kepka and Niemenmaa [\cite=phd133], Niemenmaa [\cite=phd135], [\cite=phd136], [\cite=phd162], Niemenmaa and Kepka [\cite=phd134], Csörg o and Kepka [\cite=phd103] in different fashions. The multiplication group structure determines the structure of a loop(e.g solvability of M(L) implies the solvability of a finite loop L [\cite=phd163]) while if (L) is of order 2p(p an odd prime), then M(L) is solvable hence L is solvable as well([\cite=phd164]).

The present study investigates the existence of Aρ-loops, Aλ-loops, Aμ-loops and A-loops that are neither extra loops nor CC-loops such that any two of their inner mappings R(x,y),L(x,y) and T(x) commute while the other one is of order 2.

MAIN RESULTS

Deviation

Proof If P(x,φ): = 0, then [formula] since μx(φ) = φ- 1LxφL- 1xφ.

Proof [formula]

[formula]

Let [formula]. Put x = e, then

[formula]

Now from equation ([\ref=eq:1]), we have (xy)φ = zφLxφ- 1Lxφ = (x  ·  zφ)φ- 1Lxφ = xφ  ·  (x  ·  zφ)φ- 1. So,

[formula]

Let z' = (x  ·  zφ)φ- 1, then x  ·  zφ = z'φ. Using equation ([\ref=eq:2]), x  ·  yφ2 = z'φ. Now, let x = e, then [formula]

[formula]

From equation ([\ref=eq:3]), (xy)φ = xφ  ·  z'. So by equation ([\ref=eq:4]),

Proof Recall that μx(φ) = φ- 1LxφL- 1xφ.

[formula].

φ∈PSλ(B,  ·  ) with a left companion c∈B if and only if

[formula]

L(x,y) = LxLyL- 1yx, so L(xφ,c) = LxφLcL- 1(c  ·  xφ). Thus, computing and using equation ([\ref=eq:5]), which implies [formula].

Conversely, if μx(φ) = L(xφ,c)- 1, then μx(φ)L(xφ,c) = I. So, implies φ∈PSλ(B,  ·  ) with a left companion c∈B by following equation ([\ref=eq:5]).

Following 2., [formula] such that c = e. L(xφ,e) = I,

Proof By Theorem [\ref=1:2], φ∈A(B,  ·  ). So following Theorem [\ref=automorphism:exponent2] and Lemma [\ref=1:1], μx(φ) = L- 1xφφLxφ- 1 = I. Thus, [formula].

Isotopic Characterization Of A-loops

Proof

Finally, 1 ⇔   2 and 1 ⇔   3 ⇒   2 ⇔   3. Hence the statements 1, 2 and 3 are equivalent to each other.

Proof 1 ⇔   2, 1 ⇔   3, 1 ⇔   4, 1 ⇔   5, 1 ⇔   6, 1 ⇔   7, 1 ⇔   8, 1 ⇔   9 and 1 ⇔   10 are achieved by using Theorem [\ref=rita:iso], Lemma [\ref=1:1] and Definition [\ref=definition:deviation].

Proof The proof lies wholly on Theorem [\ref=main:result]. And the outcomes are achieved by using Theorem [\ref=automorphism:exponent2], Theorem [\ref=aut:exp2] and Theorem [\ref=1:2].

Proof The proof of this is a consequence of Theorem [\ref=main:result1] by replacing x∈Ω with the identity element e of G.

The tables below summarize the important results of this subsection as shown in Theorem [\ref=main:result1] and Corollary [\ref=main:result2].

Proof This is proved using Theorem [\ref=main:result1] and Corollary [\ref=main:result2].

Proof This follows directly from Theorem [\ref=2:1].
