Congruence obstructions to pseudomodularity of Fricke groups

Introduction

A cusp of a Fuchsian group [formula] is an [formula] that is the unique fixed point of an element of Γ (see [\cite=Sh] Ch. 1). The modular group [formula] is a finite coarea Fuchsian group whose cusps are [formula]. In [\cite=LR], Long and Reid show that there exist finite coarea Fuchsian subgroups of [formula] that are not commensurable with [formula] (i.e., not arithmetic) and whose cusp set equals [formula]. They call such groups pseudomodular.

Long and Reid studied a particular family Δ(u2,2t) of Fricke groups as candidates for pseudomodularity. Fricke groups uniformize one-cusped hyperbolic tori and all such tori are uniformized by Fricke groups; see [\cite=Ab] and [\cite=Ke]. Among Long and Reid's stated open problems in [\cite=LR] is the determination of the values [formula] for which Δ(u2,2t) is pseudomodular. Recall that if [formula] is the profinite completion of [formula], then [formula] is an additive topological group having a basis of open neighborhoods of 0 consisting of m for [formula]. Then our chief result is:

The Fuchsian group Δ(u2,2t) is pseudomodular or arithmetic if and only if its finite cusps are dense in the ring [formula] of finite adeles over [formula].

Theorem [\ref=thm:ad] is in fact true for arbitrary zonal Fuchsian subgroups of [formula]. We remark that for a given t only finitely many u2 yield arithmetic groups. We shall use refinements of Theorem [\ref=thm:ad] to give explicit, infinite families of Δ(u2,2t) whose cusps are proper subsets of [formula]. For example:

Let p be a prime and t an integer at least 2. Then Δ(p- 2,2t) is neither pseudomodular nor arithmetic. In particular, infinitely many Δ(u2,2t) are neither pseudomodular nor arithmetic.

Our method is to find Δ(u2,2t)-invariant subsets of [formula] that are defined number-theoretically, either adelically or p-adically. In [\cite=LR], Long and Reid exhibit finitely many Δ(u2,2t) that are neither pseudomodular nor arithmetic. For each such group, they provide a rational number fixed by a hyperbolic element of Δ(u2,2t). Such fixed points cannot also be cusps; see [\cite=Be], p. 199. We do not know whether rational hyperbolic fixed points exist for all non-pseudomodular Δ, and in any case, our proofs do not require or produce them. So far, our results disprove pseudomodularity with a finite amount of data, in terms of either finitely many primes or (finite-index) congruence subgroups of the modular group [formula]. In the final section of this paper we discuss some further questions and possible generalizations.

Results

The numerator and denominator of a rational number will be taken coprime with the denominator positive. Let [formula] be the usual discrete valuation at prime p. If p does not divide the denominator of a rational number x (i.e., vp(x)  ≥  0) then say x is integral at p. Integral x have representatives in the ring of p-adic integers [formula] and we write [formula] to mean that the residue of x mod [formula] is m in [formula]. Finally, for nonzero rational x, we say p|x or p divides x when vp(x)  >  0.

Denote by C∞(G) the cusp set of a Fuchsian group G and let the finite cusps be denoted by [formula]. For rationals u2 and t with 0  <  u2  <  t - 1, let Δ(u2,2t) be the subgroup of [formula] generated by the hyperbolic elements

[formula]

As in [\cite=LR], Δ is a zonal Fricke group freely generated by g1 and g2 with C∞(Δ) a nonempty subset of [formula]. In fact, by considering the traces of g1, g2 and g1g2 and using results in of [\cite=CS] on varieties of group representations, we can show that every Fricke group with cusps in [formula] is conjugate in [formula] to some Δ(u2,2t). Therefore, we can study all such Fricke groups by looking at the groups Δ(u2,2t). We are interested in when [formula] or, equivalently, when [formula]. Let Λ(u2,2t) be the kernel of the homomorphism [formula] given by g1  ↦  (1,0) and g2  ↦  (0,1). Then [formula] and C(Λ)  =  C(Δ). If C(Λ) is not dense in [formula], or in some finite product [formula] with [formula] embedded diagonally, then [formula] since [formula] is dense in each of those sets.

Given this obstruction to pseudomodularity, we ask three questions: (i) when are the finite cusps of Δ(u2,2t) dense in a specified finite product [formula], (ii) is cusp density in all such products a sufficient condition for pseudomodularity, and (iii) how do the answers to the former two questions vary as u2 and t are themselves varied p-adically? The propositions below address these questions and, in particular, prove Theorem [\ref=thm:infnonpsm].

Let p be prime. If vp(t)  ≥  0 and vp(u2)  ≤   - 2, or if vp(t)  <  0 and vp(u2)  ≤  2(vp(t) - 1), then C(Δ(u2,2t)) is not dense in [formula].

Considering conditions at two primes, we can show:

If p and q are prime, vp(u2)  =   - 1  =  vq(u2), and t is integral at p and at q, then C(Δ(u2,2t)) is not dense in [formula].

Results similar to Proposition [\ref=prop:2primes] hold for t that are non-integral at p or at q; we omit their statements for brevity. As a corollary to the above two propositions, whenever t is an integer and the denominator of u2 is composite, Δ(u2,2t) is not pseudomodular. We have an even stronger result for integral t:

Let t be an integer and suppose Δ(u2,2t) is pseudomodular. Then

u2 has prime or unit denominator, say p,

if this p is an odd prime, then p does not divide t, and

for all odd primes q dividing t, u2 (necessarily in [formula]) is equivalent to 0 or - 1 mod q.

To prove each of the above propositions, we give a proper nonempty Δ-invariant subset U of [formula] that is open in the topology induced by that of [formula] or [formula]. For example, under the hypotheses of Proposition [\ref=prop:2primes], the set of nonzero rationals x for which exactly one of vp(x) and vq(x) is negative is Δ-invariant. To prove that our U are Δ-invariant, we show that the generators g±  1i of Δ map U into itself.

The difficulty of our approach lies in finding such sets U. To do this, we search computed data for patterns in valuations and congruences. We build a data set by taking a tuple [formula] of rational numbers and applying to it several elements of Δ. Useful values for the xi are rational hyperbolic (or special) fixed points, such as those tabulated in [\cite=LR]. In some cases, a tuple of length one yields some information, but typically we let the tuple be given by multiple pairs of special fixed points, with each pair fixed by a single hyperbolic element of Δ. When we have no data on special fixed points, we select the xi with particular valuation or congruence properties. In any case, a successful search suggests a candidate U, which we then confirm as described above. Varying parameters such as the denominator of u2, in such a way as to preserve the proof of the Δ-invariance, allows us to eliminate infinite families of candidates for pseudomodularity and divorce our results from computed data.

In the other direction, to show that C(Δ) is dense in a finite product [formula], we show that for each rational x, we can move x arbitrarily close to the cusp 0 with elements of (a group commensurable with) Δ. We use this argument to prove that for t a prime integer, we have identified above all cases for which C(Δ(u2,2t)) is not dense in some H:

If t is prime, u2 has prime denominator not equal to t and [formula] or - 1 mod t, then C(Δ(u2,2t)) is dense in every finite product [formula] and hence is dense in the product [formula] over all primes.

There are groups with special fixed points to which this proposition applies, such as Δ(6 / 11,6) with a special fixed point of 1 / 4. Consequently:

Density of C(Δ(u2,2t)) in the product [formula] of all p-adic fields is not a sufficient condition for pseudomodularity.

Both this corollary and Theorem [\ref=thm:ad] can be interpreted in terms of congruence data with respect to all primes. While density in the adelic topology implies pseudomodularity, density in the product topology on all p-adic fields does not. Theorem [\ref=thm:ad] holds because an orbit of a rational under a fixed translation x  ↦  x  +  t with [formula] is open in [formula] in the topology induced by [formula].

Questions

Since Λ(u2,2t) is a finitely generated subgroup of [formula], it is always a subgroup of [formula], where [formula] for some minimal set of primes [formula]. By Riemann-Hurwitz, Λ(u2,2t) always has exactly four orbits of cusps, so if we can show that Λ(u2,2t) has more than four orbits in its action on [formula], then some rationals cannot be cusps, whence Λ(u2,2t) is not pseudomodular.

For a non-pseudomodular [formula] as above, can we find a subgroup K of (finite index in) [formula] such that Λ(u2,2t)  ⊂  K and K has more than four orbits in its action on [formula]?

For the groups already eliminated by our earlier propositions, the answer is yes. We also have a positive answer for some groups whose cusps are dense in the product of all [formula]'s, such as Λ(6 / 11,6). In fact, we can construct a [formula] containing Λ(6 / 11,6) that has eight orbits in its action on [formula]. An explicit description of the orbits of K gives us a Δ(6 / 11,6)-invariant, nonempty, proper subset X of [formula] that is open in the 33-congruence topology, as defined here.

Denote by Γ(M) the principal congruence subgroup of [formula] of level M. For a finite set of primes [formula], let [formula] and let VN be the set of orbits Γ(Nj)  ·  0 as j ranges over positive integers. The N-congruence topology on [formula] is the topology generated by the [formula]-translates of VN.

If we replace Γ(Nj) with Γ0(Nj) (matrices lower-triangular mod Nj) in this definition then we recover the (coarser) topology on [formula] induced by inclusion in [formula]. Thus, in Propositions [\ref=prop:square] and [\ref=prop:2primes], we also have cusp sets failing to be dense in some congruence topology.

If the cusps of Δ are dense in [formula] in all congruence topologies, is Δ necessarily pseudomodular or arithmetic? Equivalently, if Δ is neither pseudomodular nor arithmetic, is there a congruence subgroup Γ of [formula] so that C(Δ) misses some orbit [formula]?

More generally, we can allow non-congruence subgroups Γ and we can ask analogous questions for larger families of Fuchsian groups or for Kleinian groups whose cusps lie in an imaginary quadratic number field.
