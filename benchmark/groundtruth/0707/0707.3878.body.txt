Introduction

Let [formula] be the vector space of dimension n over [formula]. The Hamming distance between vectors [formula], denoted by d(x,y), is the number of coordinates in which x and y differ. A binary code C of length n is a subset of [formula], its elements are called codewords. The minimum distance of a code C is the minimum of the distances between pairs of different codewords.

Let C be a binary code. If C is a subspace of [formula], then we say that C is a

[formula]

and

[formula]

code.

If C1 and C2 are nonlinear (n,|C1|,d1) and (n,|C2|,d2) codes then, C is a nonlinear (2n,|C1|  ·  |C2|,min{2d1,d2}) code.

Let C1 and C2 be binary codes of length n, [formula], [formula], and let C be the binary code built from them via contruction ([\ref=eq:PlotkinC]). Therefore,

Ker(C) = {(x|x + y):x∈Ker(C1),y∈Ker(C2)},
