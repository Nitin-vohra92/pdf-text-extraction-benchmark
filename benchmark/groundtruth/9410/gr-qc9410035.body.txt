Abstract

Pair-production of magnetic Reissner-Nordström black holes (of charges ±  q) is studied in the next-to-leading WKB approximation. We consider generic quantum fluctuations in the corresponding instanton geometry, a detailed study of which suggests that, for sufficiently weak field B, the problem can be reduced to that of quantum fluctuations around a single truncated near-extremal Euclidean black hole in thermal equilibrium. Typical one-loop contributions are such that the leading WKB exponent is corrected by a small fraction ~  2. We show that this effect is merely due to a semiclassical shift of the black hole mass-to-charge ratio that persists even in the extremal limit. We close with a few final comments.

Recently, the pair-production of oppositely charged magnetic black holes in a background magnetic field, has been studied to the leading WKB approximation [\cite=ERNST][\cite=GGS][\cite=GAUNT][\cite=GG]. The instanton mediating the tunneling process is found to be the Euclidean section of the so-called Ernst metric, and the Euclidean action thereof has been calculated exactly.

One cannot emphasize too much the importance of such processes in the context of black hole quantum physics. The apparent conflict between the unitarity principle and the black hole evaporation [\cite=Info] spurred many different speculations [\cite=remnants] regarding true nature of the black hole, most of which cannot be tested from the usual semiclassical reasonings leading to the presence of Hawking radiation. Spontaneous pair-productions of charged black holes, then, provides an alternative theoretical laboratory where one may gain further insight on this controversial issue.

As a part of effort in this regard, we want to study the tunneling event when the pair-produced objects are near-extremal Reissner-Nordström black holes. One interesting property of the extremal limit is that the proper distance to the horizon diverges, suggesting very large spatial volume associated with the black hole, that might contain many degenerate states [\cite=Trivedi2]. Our main purpose here is to determine whether this leads to a huge enhancement of the tunneling rate at one-loop level, or even a breakdown of the semiclassical approximation. More complete account of the present work appeared elsewhere [\cite=WKB].

Let us first write down the instanton metric that mediates the pair-production of arbitrary magnetic Reissner-Nordström black holes[\cite=ERNST][\cite=GAUNT].

[formula]

The geometry comes with two Killing coordinates T and φ, where the latter generates an axial symmetry. The Minkowskian version of this metric describes the geometry after the materialization of the black holes which are subsequently accelerated by the Lorentz force. For sufficiently small external field in particular, B and A correspond to the magnetic field strength on the symmetric axis and the magnitude of acceleration. The remaining three parameters are related by [formula] and 0 < r-  ≤  r+.

The audience may find this metric a little bit disturbing, for it appears completely static with the time coordinate being T. How do we know that the black holes are really accelerating? The resolution of the puzzle is easily obtained by studying the geometry far away from the pair-created objects. After a couple of coordinate redefinitions [\cite=GG]:

[formula]

the metric can be rewritten as follows provided that - r±Ay  ≪  1,

[formula]

This constitutes a background space containing an external magnetic field, referred to as a Melvin universe. Note that, up to the warping influence of B, the metric looks like that of Rindler where a family of accelerating observers appear static with respect to their common proper time. Therefore, an object static with respect to the Killing coordinate T is actually experiencing an acceleration roughly given by 1 / ζΛ. In particular, it turns out that the black holes, if small compared to B- 1, are at ζ≃1 / A and ρ  ≪  1 / A, partially confirming our statement that the black holes are accelerating at A. Furthermore, as is well-known among researchers, such a uniformly accelerating object behaves as if it is in a heat bath of temperature TUnruh≃π [\cite=Unruh]. This fact will be of central importance in studying the tunneling process later on.

Are the pair-produced black holes really of Reissner-Nordström type? In order to separate out distortions due to the accelerating motion of these objects, it is sufficient to consider the case r+A  →  0. Expanding in terms of a new radial coordinate [formula],

[formula]

and introducing two more coordinates [formula] a Euclidean time, and θ  =   cos - 1x the azimuthal angle [\cite=GAUNT], we find an approximate form of the geometry near the black hole valid for small acceleration:

[formula]

This is of course the celebrated Reissner-Nordström black hole, whose mass [formula] is bounded below by its absolute charge [formula]. The extremal limit, r=  →  r-, saturates this inequality.

In the above limit of small A, it is immediately clear that the configuration described by Eq. [\ref=eq:E-E] cannot be a classical solution for all values of A, B, and r±. For one thing, to the leading order, the only force acting on the black holes is the Lorentz force. This demands the acceleration be proportional to the external magnetic field:

[formula]

Under more general circumstances, in fact, the corresponding constraint appears from the condition that there is no cosmic strings attached to the black holes [\cite=ERNST][\cite=GAUNT]: a rather fancy way of deriving the black hole equation of motion.

Ordinarily this would be end of the story: the instanton would be parametrized by three independent parameters which are the mass m, the charge q and the external magnetic field B. Changing m with the other two fixed would simply result in different WKB exponent. However, unlike point-particles or nonsingular solitons, a black hole of given charge and mass is not a semiclassically stable object in general. Whenever its Hawking temperature is nonzero, it radiates thermal radiations that tends to decrease its mass steadily in the absence of any matter influx [\cite=Hawking]:

[formula]

This poses a conceptual difficulty in gluing the imaginary-time description of the tunneling to the real-time evolution thereafter, since such a transition is possible only when the configuration is truely free from any time dependence at the moment. For this reason, a semiclassically consistent calculation requires the black holes to be in thermal equilibrium with their environment when they materialize:

[formula]

The accelerating black hole not only radiates at temperature TBH but also accretes thermal quanta from the surrounding Rindler heat bath [\cite=Unruh] alluded earlier. The equal temperature is therefore necessary to ensure time-independence at the moment of materialization.

This requirement turns out to be encoded naturally in the singularity-free geometry of the Euclidean instanton [\cite=ERNST][\cite=GAUNT], in much the same fashion as a singularity-free Euclidean black hole knows about its Hawking temperature. Together with the Newton's law (Eq. [\ref=eq:NT]), this fundamental constraint dictates that the weak field limit is identical to the extremal limit r+  →  r-, thus simplifying our task considerably.

In the same weak field limit, the leading WKB exponent, as determined by the Euclidean action of the instanton [\cite=ERNST][\cite=GGS][\cite=GG], can be expanded as follows,

[formula]

The last expression is easily recognized as the Schwinger term that also appears in the monopole pair-production [\cite=MONO], while the ellipsis denotes terms of higher order in qB, and includes the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy +  SBH≃πq2 [\cite=BEK].

Now before we ask how strong is the one-loop correction to this as qB≃r+A  →  0, it is instructive to see the overall shape of the instanton geometry. We have already seen that, for small values of qB≃r+A, the geometry is approximated by simpler ones near and far away from the black hole, More precisely, the geometry is that of a single Eucludean black hole for - 1 / y  ≪  1 while it is that of a Melvin universe for - r+Ay  ≪  1. In addition, the two approximate regions actually overlap with each other for even smaller r+A: The full instanton consists of these two simple geometric components connected via a transtional region where both approximations make sense.

[formula]

In terms of the Rindler-like coordinates of the background Melvin space, this corresponds to ζ≃1 / A and ρ  ≪  1 / A where a Euclidean black hole without the asymptotic region must be attached smoothly to the background space [\cite=WKB]. To see where the transition occurs in term of r, it is sufficient to compare how typical curvature scales for each component: curvatures of the black hole geometry scales like q / r3 while, for small ρ, the Melvin space is curved at a typical scale of B2. Equating the two, we find that the black hole must be truncated at r = rB  ~  (q / B2)1 / 3 [\cite=WKB]. This simple picture of the instanton is depicted in figure 1. without the correct scale.

Figure 1: A schematic diagram for the Euclidean instantons. In the weak field limit, the bottom "cup" is described by a near-extremal Euclidean black hole, while the top "sheet" is the Euclidean Melvin space. The acceleration horizon and the black hole horizon are located at points A and B, respectively. The transitional "mouth" region is denoted by the broken curve where the area of the transverse two-sphere is ~  4π  q2 / 3B- 4 / 3.

An interesting property of this geometry is the divergent 4-volume of the bottom "cup" region, or the truncated Euclidean black hole, as qB  →  0: divergent not only because of the increasing circumference along the time direction but also because of the logarithmically divergent distance to the black hole horizon. On the other hand, if we were studying pair-production of ordinary charged particles in flat spacetime, the truncated Euclidean black hole would be replaced by a simple circular trajectory of the particle in question, and there would be no divergent extra 4-volume to speak of. This again remind us of the primary question whether the extremal limit in this context involves huge quantum corrections from many low-energy modes uniquely associated with black holes.

One of the more important aspect of this Euclidean instanton is the natural vacuum associated with it. As emphasized above, the nonsingular Euclidean horizons demand that there exists a thermal equilibrium between the black holes and their environment, which implies that the vacuum behaves like a Hartle-Hawking vacuum near the black holes [\cite=GG][\cite=WKB]. But, from a purely Euclidean point of view, Hartle-Hawking vacua are a naive consequence of the periodic imaginary time, and do not appear particularly unique to this pair-production process.

In reality, however, the usual physical vacuum around a black hole in real time cannot be the static Hartle-Hawking vacuum that describes a thermal equilibrium, but the evolving Unruh vacuum that involves the thermal Hawking radiation, one of the reason being that the necessary heat bath extends naturally to the asymptotic region, costing an infinite amount of energy. This happens because the gravitational redshift settles down to a finite factor as quanta climes out of the gravitational well. Alternatively, one simply observes that the proper circumference along the imaginary time approaches a constant BH asymptotically.

On the other hand, the instanton geometry does not asymptote to that of a Euclidean black hole, but rather to that of a Melvin space in Rindler-like coordinates of Eq. [\ref=eq:New]. The asymptotic region is then essentially a flat spacetime as seen by Rindler observers, up to the gentle warping influence of magnetic flux. Therefore, the natural vacuum behaves like a Hartle-Hawking vacuum where r  <  rB but smoothly continues to a Melvin analogue of the ordinary Minkowski vacuum.

The upshot is that the necessary heat baths around the pair-produced black holes, Euclidean or not, are now of finite size ~  rB. Hence, the hybrid nature of the instanton geometry makes the semiclassical equilibrium possible without costing an infinite amount of energy.

Above discussions tell us, among other things, that in a suitable limit the problem of finding one-loop corrections to the leading WKB estimates may reduce to a simpler problem involving quantum fluctuations around a single Euclidean black hole truncated at r  ~  rB. It is clear that in the weak field limit, the classical geometry does split into two regions, one of which merely provides background fields. Furthermore, the vacuum state also appears to be "cut off" naturally at the boundary between the two regions. This combined with the fact that we actually calculate the ratio of two partition functions, one associated with the total instanton geometry and the other associated with the background Melvin space, indeed suggests that we may concentrate on the bottom "cup" part of the instanton [\cite=WKB].

Of course, in principle, it might be very important exactly how this truncated manifold is attached to the background Melvin space, but as far as the simple examples we consider in order to isolate the leading qB terms, this does not appear to be the case. For the remainder of the talk, we will concentrate on one particular contribution that arises from the so-called Callan-Rubakov modes, for which an explicit calculation is available. Estimates for more general cases as well as a detailed version of the discussions so far can be found elsewhere [\cite=WKB].

For most quantum fluctuations around the instanton solution, there exist potential barriers near the black hole event horizon. For instance, angular momentum l modes of a minimally coupled massless scalar find the following potential barrier Vl in the tortoise coordinate z.

[formula]

Such potential barriers are especially inhibitive for low energy excitations which are responsible for the infrared behaviour of the effective action.

One exception to this is the celebrated Callan-Rubakov modes [\cite=Callan][\cite=Holzhey] in spherically symmetric magnetic field backgrounds, chargeless combinations of which propagate effectively as 2-D conformal fields [\cite=Alford][\cite=theta]. While the instanton geometry is not spherically symmetric everywhere, we have seen that, in the weak field limit qB  →  0, the spherical symmetry is restored near the Euclidean black hole horizon, giving us some hope that the contribution from these uninhibited modes near the Euclidean black hole may capture the essential physics of the next-to-leading WKB.

The effective actions obtained by integrating over 2-D conformal fluctuations are exactly known in an explicitly non-local form, namely the Polyakov-Liouville action [\cite=Polyakov], up to a local topological contribution. Accordingly, the contribution to the prefactor [\cite=ColeWKB], NCR, from N such S-wave modes can be written as following,

[formula]

The ellipsis denote a topological term independent of the geometry. The form of Polyakov-Liouville action becomes particularly convenient to handle in conformal coordinates, since the scalar curvature R(2) above can be expressed simply as a Laplacian of the conformal mode. Here, let us choose an asymptotically flat conformal coordinate.

[formula]

For the case of the Euclidean Reissner-Nordström black hole, in particular, F and z are given by

[formula]

The importance of choosing the conformal gauge can be seen from the following general relationship, where h is any harmonic function on the given manifold, to be fixed by the boundary condition chosen:

[formula]

This way, all the dependence on the choice of vacuum is encoded into a single harmonic function h. On the other hand, as argued earlier, the black holes created by the instanton (Eq. [\ref=eq:E-E]) are in Rindler heat-baths of finite size, and the relevant vacuum must behave like a Hartle-Hawking vacuum near the black hole horizon. One characteristic of the Hartle-Hawking vacuum is that the potential divergence of energy-momentum expectation values on both past and future event horizon disappears. Moreover, we expect h to be independent of the time coordinate, for the state is supposed to be in thermal equilibrium. A consistent choice is then given by

[formula]

where C is in arbitrary integration constant. With this choice, we find semiclassical spacetimes with regular event horizons of non-zero Hawking temperatures (but with infinite ADM masses due to the heat bath), which is exactly what one expects from the Hartle-Hawking vacuum [\cite=Trivedi][\cite=Jaemo].

Note that there are some harmless ambiguities remaining. In particular, an additive shift of the constant C can be translated into an additive shift of the topological term proportional to the Euler number which is insensitive to the number qB.

Evaluating the Polyakov-Liouville action with [formula], we find,

[formula]

The radial integral comes with the upper limit at rB, for the relevant geometry is the truncated Euclidean black hole, but it matters little owing to the rapidly vanishing behaviour of the integrand. The resulting integral is finite for any TBH, and is continuous in the extremal limit.

[formula]

Using the constraint TBH  /  ≃A / 2π≃B / 2π, we arrive at the following one-loop corrected exponent,

[formula]

The ellipsis now denotes terms from quantum fluctuations other than the chargeless Callan-Rubakov modes as well as terms of higher order in qB.

We can also consider more realistic contributions from genuinely four-dimensional quantum fields. This turns out to yield similar qB dependence, although technical difficulties kept us from evaluating the relevant coefficients [\cite=WKB].

An immediate consequence of this is that there seems to be nothing special about the extremal limit other than the fact that the Euclidean orbit of the magnetic black hole diverges like 1 / B. In particular, the divergence of W  ~  1 / qB  ~  BH in the extremal limit TBH  →  0 results from the diverging periodicity BH of the Euclidean time coordinate rather than from the diverging 3-volume near the black hole horizon. Per unit Euclidean time, the contribution of quantum fluctuations at one-loop level remains finite in the extremal limit.

In fact, we believe that this leading one-loop correction can be explained as a direct consequence of a semiclassically shifted mass-to-charge ratio of the black holes in question [\cite=Jaemo]. To see this, it is necessary to restore the classical mass m≃q of these near-extremal black holes:

[formula]

Note that the one-loop corrected expression would look like the original Schwinger term if we introduce a new mass parameter [formula] as follows:

[formula]

This leads us to speculate that this particular one-loop correction simply represents a semiclassical effect that shifts near-extremal black hole masses.

If this conjecture is to hold, it is necessary that the mass-to-charge ratio of extremal Reissner-Nordström black holes is semiclassically modified from 1 to 1 - N  /  72πq2, in the presence of N chargeless Callan-Rubakov modes. Exactly how does this happen? Although the extremal black hole is well-known for its vanishing Hawking temperature, and does not emit the usual late-time thermal radiation, this tells us nothing about the transient behaviour right after the gravitational collapse. In principle, it is possible that a finite amount of quantum energy escapes before the state settle down to the ground state, thus reducing the black hole mass.

To understand such a transient behaviour, one needs to calculate the energy-momentum expectation values accurately everywhere, or equivalently the relevant Bogolubov transformations valid for all retarded time, not an easy task in general. But again with the help of Polyakov-Liouville action, the problem becomes manageable for effective 2-D conformal modes. The resulting semiclassical modification of the mass-to-charge ratio was first demonstrated and estimated in reference [\cite=Jaemo], where N chargeless Callan-Rubakov modes are quantized around extremal Reissner-Nordström black holes. Both analytic and numerical studies revealed that the semiclassically corrected extremal black holes obey the following mass-to-charge ratio, when N2 is small;

[formula]

which is indeed consistent with the above interpretation of one-loop WKB correction.

The analogous shifts of the mass-to-charge ratio due to general quantum fluctuations are yet to be calculated, but it is reasonable to expect the same interpretation to hold for other cases as well.

The main result (Eq. [\ref=eq:remass]) states that to the first nonvanishing order in qB, the one-loop corrected WKB exponent is simply the Schwinger term but with quantum mechanically corrected mass rather than the tree-level mass. The result is most sensible and assuring in that it is exactly what one would expect for pair-production of ordinary charge particles. But at the same time it is rather disappointing. Despite the ever-increasing size of the bottom "cup" uniquely associated with the near-extremal black hole pair-production, even the strongest correction in the weak field limit can be explained away and does not lead to new interesting physics.

Of course, it is always a logical possibility that some nontrivial and large physical effects are hidden in higher order terms, especially in B independent one-loop contributions that must include a correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Unlike our calculations here, unfortunately, the estimate of such higher order terms in qB appears a lot more sensitive to how one treats the transitional "mouth" region, and thus is much more difficult to carry out. For example, we have been rather cavalier about the boundary at r = rB of the truncated black hole and pretended that it is infinitely far away, which appears justifiable only for the leading qB behaviour found above.

One of the more problematic aspects of the Euclidean approach here is the fact that Euclidean path integral is ill-defined if dynamical gravity is included, which we circumvented by substituting general matter field for actual gravitational fluctuations. In other words, the genuine operators governing small gravitational fluctuations are not even elliptic, and in particular possess infinite number of zero-eigenmodes, not to mention infinite number of negative eigenmodes. Note that by substituting in general matter fluctuations as above, we in effect concentrated on positive eigenmodes-modes only,

For these reasons, there is still a long way to go before any concrete claim can be put forward regarding the genuine one-loop WKB amplitude of this process. One potentially promising extension of the present work is to evaluate the analogous quantities in the context of string theory. Note that what we have done here is essentially a calculation of the partition function in single Euclidean black holes. By generalizing to string one-loop partition functions, for instance, we shall have the gravitational degree of freedom already built-in. While there is no known exact conformal field theories for 4-D nonextremal black holes, lower dimensional toy models are available, such as a family of 3-D rotating black holes [\cite=BTZ], described by orbifolds of the SL(2,R) Wess-Zumino-Witten coset model [\cite=Welch]. It might be possible to gain further insight under such simplified settings.
