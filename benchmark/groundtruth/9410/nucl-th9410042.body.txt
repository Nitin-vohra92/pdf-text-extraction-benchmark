Recently, a puzzling new phenomenon has been observed in few superdeformed rotational sequences. Namely, dynamical moments of inertia of several bands exhibit small regular variations (staggering) as functions of angular momentum. The effect consists in systematic energy displacements of rotational states, which are alternately pushed up and down along the rotational band. Thus the energy levels are separated into two sequences with the spin values I, I+4, I+8, [formula] and I+2, I+6, I+10, [formula], respectively. One should mention that the effect is of the order of 50 eV, and since the excitation energies of superdeformed bands are of the order of 20 MeV, the observed shifts correspond to a 10- 6 perturbation of the energy levels.

This phenomenon was first observed in the superdeformed yrast band of 149Gd [\cite=Fli]. To date the staggering has also been found in three bands of 194Hg [\cite=Ced] and in one band of 153Dy [\cite=Asz]. The characteristic feature is that the bifurcation into two ΔI=4 families appears at a certain (high) rotational frequency, the amplitude of the oscillations increases with spin, and, sometimes, the change of phase in the oscillatory pattern is observed.

The bifurcation of the rotational band into the two families of states can be associated with the existence of a higher-order symmetry in superdeformed states. The symmetry results in the appearance of a new quantum number distinguishing the two branches. Since the period of the oscillations is [formula]=4, a possible explanation can be based on the four-fold rotational symmetry [\cite=Fli]. The possible origin of this symmetry could be the coupling between the rotational motion and the hexadecapole vibration. We expect that for high angular momenta the hexadecapole phonon becomes aligned along the rotation axis and gives rise to a small hexadecapole perturbation of the average field. The above mechanism was suggested by Peker et al. [\cite=Pek] to explain a similar effect observed at low spins in 236U, 238U, and 218Ra nuclei.

In order to study a possibility that the hexadecapole correlations are responsible for the staggering in the moment of inertia, we analyzed the exact solutions of the single-j shell system with identical particles interacting via quadrupole-quadrupole and hexadecapole-hexadecapole interactions [\cite=Bur]. The Hamiltonian for this simple model can be written in the following form:

[formula]

where λ  ·  λ=[formula] and λμ for λ=2 and 4 denotes the quadrupole and hexadecapole operator, respectively. Such a model has two properties which are of great importance in this case: it fully takes into account quantum dynamics and yields states with good angular momentum.

We analyzed collective quadrupole bands for j=15/2 and j=21/2 and different particle numbers. We found that the staggering effect (see Fig. 1) appears in yrast bands when the hexadecapole coupling constant χ4 is larger than a certain critical value χcrit4. This shows that the hexadecapole correlations may indeed be responsible for the [formula]=4 staggering.

On a phenomenological level, effects of the hexadecapole deformation can be simulated by using an intrinsic Hamiltonian which is a quartic function of angular momentum. Such an operator can in principle have the same spatial four-fold symmetry as the microscopic mean field with hexadecapole distorsions. Recently such an approach has been proposed by Hamamoto and Mottelson [\cite=HM]. They considered a rotational Hamiltonian with an explicit four-fold symmetry around the z-axis (perpendicular to the rotational axis) which has the form:

[formula]

The four lowest states form then a quartet of states which can be labeled by the quantum number associated with the C4 symmetry. The authors found that for a certain ratio of parameters A/B1 and for B2=0 the staggering appears as a result of the tunneling between the four degenerate different minima in the total energy surface of Hamiltonian ([\ref=HH]).

In the present study we address the question whether the staggering occurs also when the C4 term in the Hamiltonian is a small perturbation on the top of the large C2-invariant term (i.e., term which posesses a two-fold symmetry). We consider a modified Hamiltonian of the form

[formula]

We neglect terms proportional to (Î2x  +  Î2y) and (Î2x  +  Î2y)2 as they lead only to a renormalization of the coefficient A. The additional term in ([\ref=e3]) has the explicit two-fold symmetry and henceforth breaks the C4 symmetry when D1  ≠  0. We put parameters A and B1 to be equal 90 and 1, respectively. For these values Hamamoto and Mottelson [\cite=HM] found the staggering pattern present. Having the parameters A and B1 fixed we changed the coefficient D1 (see Fig. 2). One can see that even for relatively high values of D1 the staggering effect is still present. Although the C4 symmetry is broken in this case, and the corresponding quantum number has only an approximate meaning, one is still able to use this label to distinguish states of the lowest quartet. Finally, for the chosen set of parameters A and B1 the staggering vanishes at D1  ≈  1.4. In this limit, the system rotates around the y-axis (see Fig. 3). This is a consequence of the appearance of the two well-defined minima in the total energy surface (see Fig. 4). The quartet of the lowest states separates then into two families of degenerate pairs labeled by the quantum number of C2.

The above results suggest that even a small C4-type perturbation can give rise to a staggering effect. This may suggest that one can search for a microscopic justification of the four-fold symmetry with respect to the rotational axis, where the C2 term dominates. One should mention that according to recent cranked-Nilsson calculations [\cite=Ing] there is no evidence for a strong four-fold symmetry breaking with respect to the axial symmetry axis.
