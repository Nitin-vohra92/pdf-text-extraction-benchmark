Fourier frames for singular measures and pure type phenomena

Introduction

Let μ be a positive and finite Borel measure on [formula]. By a Fourier frame for the space L2(μ) one means a system of exponential functions

[formula]

(where Λ is a countable subset of [formula]) which constitutes a frame in the space. The latter means that there are constants 0 < A,B <   ∞   such that the inequalities

[formula]

hold for every f∈L2(μ). The existence of a Fourier frame E(Λ) for L2(μ) allows one to decompose in a "stable" (but generally non-unique) way any function f from the space in a Fourier series [formula] with frequencies belonging to Λ (see [\cite=You01]).

For which measures μ does a Fourier frame exist? The origin of this question goes back to Fuglede [\cite=Fug74] who initiated a study of orthogonal bases of exponentials over domains in [formula] endowed with Lebesgue measure, and to Jorgensen and Pedersen [\cite=JP98] who discovered the existence of fractal measures which admit such orthogonal bases. It is well-known, however, that the existence of an orthogonal basis E(Λ) for L2(μ) is a strong requirement, satisfied by a relatively small class of measures μ. Hence it is of interest to understand whether measures which do not admit such a basis can at least have a frame of exponentials.

It is known [\cite=LW06] [\cite=HLL13] that if a measure μ has a Fourier frame, then it must be of "pure type": μ is either discrete, absolutely continuous or singular continuous.

The case when μ is a discrete measure is well understood: μ has a Fourier frame if and only if it has finitely many atoms [\cite=HLL13]. It is also known precisely which absolutely continuous measures μ have a Fourier frame: this is the case if and only if μ is supported on a set of finite Lebesgue measure in [formula], and its density function is bounded from above and from below almost everywhere on the support [\cite=Lai11] [\cite=DL14] [\cite=NOU16] (in the last paper the authors used the solution of the Kadison-Singer problem [\cite=MSS15] to prove the existence of a Fourier frame in the case when the support is unbounded).

The case when the measure μ is singular and continuous, on the other hand, is much less understood. In this context mainly self-similar measures have been studied (see e.g. [\cite=DLW16] and the references therein). However, even the following question [\cite=Str00] is still open: does the middle-third Cantor measure have a Fourier frame? (It is known [\cite=JP98] that this measure has no orthogonal basis of exponentials.)

It has been conjectured that there should exist a "refined" pure type phenomenon within the class of singular continuous measures. Namely, if such a measure has components of different dimensions then it cannot have a Fourier frame. A concrete formulation of such a conjecture was given explicitly in [\cite=DL14].

The paper [\cite=DHSW11] contains some results in this direction. These results establish a connection between the fractal dimension of some self-similar measures μ and the "Beurling dimension" of certain Fourier frames for these measures.

However, in the present paper we obtain some results which contradict the above conjecture. In particular, we prove the following:

There is a measure μ on [formula] [formula] which is the sum of the arc length measure on a curve and the area measure on a hypersurface, such that L2(μ) has a Fourier frame.

The result thus shows that a measure with a Fourier frame can nevertheless have components of different dimensions. Actually, the measure μ in our example is simply the sum of the arc length measure on the segment ×  {0}d - 1 and the area measure on the hypersurface {0}  ×  [0,1]d - 1. We will obtain Theorem [\ref=thm_A2.1] as a special case of a more general result (Theorem [\ref=thm_B2.1]) that allows one to construct many examples of "mixed type" measures which have a Fourier frame.

On the other hand, we will see that under additional geometric assumptions on the components of the measure, one can establish pure type phenomena with respect to the dimension of these components. For example, we will prove the following result:

Let μ be a measure on [formula] [formula] which is the sum of the arc length measure on an open subset of a smooth curve, and the area measure on an open subset of a smooth hypersurface. If the Gaussian curvature of the hypersurface is everywhere non-zero, then L2(μ) does not admit a Fourier frame.

It is instructive to notice the contrast between the curvature requirement in this result and the "flatness" of the hypersurface in the example of Theorem [\ref=thm_A2.1]. We will deduce Theorem [\ref=thm_A2.2] from a more general result (Theorem [\ref=thm_C3.1]) that establishes a certain pure type phenomenon within the class of singular continuous measures.

Theorem [\ref=thm_A2.2] would not be meaningful unless its assumptions were sufficiently wide to allow the existence of a Fourier frame for each "pure" component of the measure separately. For (as one may easily verify) if one of these components cannot have a Fourier frame, then the same is automatically true for the measure μ itself.

The following result provides many examples of "single dimensional" measures which do admit a Fourier frame:

Let μ be a measure on [formula], which is the k-dimensional area measure on a compact subset of the graph [formula] of a smooth function [formula] [formula]. Then L2(μ) has a Fourier frame.

This result has a quite straightforward proof (see Section [\ref=sec_D1]), but its main point is to clarify that the assumptions in Theorem [\ref=thm_A2.2] indeed do not prevent the existence of a Fourier frame for each "pure" component of the measure separately.

Mixed type measures with a Fourier frame

In this section we present a method for constructing examples of measure which have components of different dimensions, but nevertheless have a Fourier frame. As a special case we will obtain Theorem [\ref=thm_A2.1].

Let μ be a measure on [formula], and ν be a measure on [formula]. We assume that both measures are positive and finite on their respective spaces. From the two measures μ,ν one can construct a new measure ρ on [formula], defined by

[formula]

where δ0 denotes the Dirac measure at the origin. Equivalently, the measure ρ may be defined by the requirement that

[formula]

for every continuous, compactly supported function f on [formula].

Assume that μ,ν are continuous measures, and that each one of them has a Fourier frame. Then also the measure ρ given by [\eqref=eq_B2.1] has a Fourier frame.

For example, if we take μ (respectively ν) to be the Lebesgue measure on the segment

[formula]

We now give the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_B2.1].

We assume that μ,ν are continuous measures (each one may be either absolutely continuous or singular) and that each one of them has a Fourier frame. Let [formula], [formula] be countable sets such that the exponential system E(U) is a frame in L2(μ), and E(V) a frame in L2(ν). Hence there exist constants 0 < A,B <   ∞   such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

for every g∈L2(μ), h∈L2(ν).

Fix a positive integer q satisfying

[formula]

For each u∈U, choose a subset F(u) of V consisting of exactly q elements, in such a way that the sets F(u), u∈U, are disjoint subsets of V. This is possible since ν is a continuous measure, hence L2(ν) is an infinite dimensional space and so V must be an infinite set. In a completely symmetric way we may choose, for each v∈V, a subset G(v) of U consisting of exactly q elements, and such that the sets G(v), v∈V, are disjoint subsets of U. Now define

[formula]

It would be convenient to know that Λμ and Λν are disjoint subsets of U  ×  V, which we may assume with no loss of generality by an appropriate choice of the sets F(u), G(v).

Finally, let

[formula]

We claim that the exponential system E(Λ) is a frame in L2(ρ).

Indeed, let f∈L2(ρ). Then f has a unique decomposition as

[formula]

where g∈L2(μ), h∈L2(ν). This is due to the definition [\eqref=eq_B2.1] of the measure ρ (the uniqueness of this decomposition is true since μ,ν have no atom at the origin). Notice that for any [formula] we have

[formula]

For any two complex numbers a,b we have

[formula]

hence

[formula]

Using the fact that the sets F(u) are disjoint subsets of V with exactly q elements each, this implies that

[formula]

where we have used [\eqref=eq_B1.1.3] and [\eqref=eq_B1.1.4] in the last inequality. In a completely symmetric way one can also show that

[formula]

Summing the last two inequalities (and using the assumption that Λμ and Λν are disjoint sets) we get

[formula]

Due to [\eqref=eq_B1.1.5] this provides a lower frame bound for the system E(Λ) in L2(ρ).

The upper frame bound can be obtained in a similar way, by using the inequality

[formula]

instead of [\eqref=eq_B1.1.2] in the estimates above. Indeed, we have

[formula]

Similarly one can verify that

[formula]

and summing the last two inequalities we get the estimate from above

[formula]

which confirms that the exponential system E(Λ) is indeed a frame for L2(ρ).

Although Theorem [\ref=thm_B2.1] allows us to construct many examples of "mixed type" measures with a Fourier frame, there exist certain limitations on the possible dimensions of the components of the measure in [\eqref=eq_B2.1]. For instance, the theorem does not tell us whether the measure in [formula] which is the sum of the 2-dimensional area measure on 2  ×  {0}2 and the 3-dimensional area measure on {0}  ×  [0,1]3 has a Fourier frame.

However, more general examples are easy to construct by taking the product ρ  ×  σ of the measure ρ in [\eqref=eq_B2.1] with any measure σ in [formula] [formula] such that also σ has a Fourier frame. For it is a general fact that if E(Λ) is a frame in L2(ρ) and E(Γ) a frame in L2(σ), then E(Λ  ×  Γ) is a frame in L2(ρ  ×  σ), hence ρ  ×  σ also has a Fourier frame.

For example, in this way one can obtain the following extension of Theorem [\ref=thm_A2.1] above:

Consider the measure on [formula] which is the sum of the k-dimensional area measure on k  ×  {0}d - k, and the j-dimensional area measure on {0}d - j  ×  [0,1]j [formula]. Then this measure has a Fourier frame.

Indeed, the measure in this result is (after permutation of the coordinates) of the form ρ  ×  σ, where ρ is given by [\eqref=eq_B2.1] and μ, ν and σ are respectively the n, m and p-dimensional area measures on n, m and p  ×  {0}q for appropriate values of n, m, p and q. Since in this case each one of μ, ν and σ has a Fourier frame, Theorem [\ref=thm_B2.2] follows. (In particular, for d = 4, k = 2 and j = 3 we obtain an affirmative answer to the question mentioned above.)

Pure type phenomena for singular continuous measures

The results in the previous section contradict the existence of a general pure type principle within the class of singular continuous measures. However, our goal in the present section is to demonstrate that such principles can nevertheless be established under some extra assumptions on the components of the measure. In particular we will prove Theorem [\ref=thm_A2.2] above.

Let μ be a positive, finite measure on [formula]. Given a real number α, [formula], we consider the following condition:

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the Fourier transform of the measure μ.

Intuitively, we think of condition [\eqref=eq_C2.1.1] in some sense as saying that μ has "at least one component of dimension not greater that α". For example, if μ is an absolutely continuous measure with an L2 density, then [\eqref=eq_C2.1.1] is satisfied only for α = d, by the Plancherel identity. At the other extreme, by the classical Wiener's lemma, the condition [\eqref=eq_C2.1.1] holds with α = 0 if and only if μ has at least one non-zero atom (see [\cite=Str90a]).

An example of a singular continuous measure μ satisfying [\eqref=eq_C2.1.1] for some α < d is given by the area measure on an open subset of a smooth k-dimensional submanifold in [formula] ([formula]). In this case the condition [\eqref=eq_C2.1.1] holds for α = k [\cite=AH76] [\cite=Str90a]. It was also proved in [\cite=Str90a] that [\eqref=eq_C2.1.1] is true if μ is the α-dimensional Hausdorff measure on certain self-similar fractals of dimension α (in the latter case α need not be an integer). See also [\cite=Str90b] [\cite=Str93a] [\cite=Str93b] for further results in this connection.

Recall that a system of vectors {fn} in a Hilbert space H is called a Bessel system if there is a positive constant C such that the inequality

[formula]

(Bessel's inequality) is satisfied for every f∈H.

Suppose that a system of exponentials E(Λ) constitutes a Bessel system in L2(μ), where μ is a measure satisfying [\eqref=eq_C2.1.1] for some α, [formula]. Then

[formula]

for a certain constant C which does not depend on r.

Here and below B(x,r) denotes the open ball of radius r centered at the point x.

Lemma [\ref=lem_C2.1] should be compared to [\cite=DHSW11] where the estimate [\eqref=eq_C2.1.2] was proved for exponential Bessel systems E(Λ) on certain self-similar measures μ of fractal dimension α. For such measures which also satisfy condition [\eqref=eq_C2.1.1] we obtain the latter result as a special case of Lemma [\ref=lem_C2.1].

Assume that E(Λ) is a Bessel system in L2(μ). Then applying Bessel's inequality [\eqref=eq_C2.1.1b] to the functions et ([formula]) we obtain

[formula]

for a certain constant C1. Integrating this inequality over the ball B(x,2r) yields

[formula]

On the other hand, we have

[formula]

Due to the assumption [\eqref=eq_C2.1.1], the integral on the right hand side of the last inequality is not less than C3  rd - α for all sufficiently large r, for an appropriate constant C3 > 0. Combining this with [\eqref=eq_C2.1.5] we obtain the assertion of the lemma.

Given a set [formula], one defines its upper Beurling dimension to be the infimum of the numbers α for which there exists a constant C such that [\eqref=eq_C2.1.2] holds (see [\cite=CKS08]). Lemma [\ref=lem_C2.1] thus shows that if E(Λ) is a Bessel system for a measure μ satisfying the condition [\eqref=eq_C2.1.1] for some α, then the upper Beurling dimension of Λ cannot exceed α.

If the exponential system E(Λ) is not just a Bessel system, but moreover is a frame in L2(μ) for some "α-dimensional" measure μ, then in spirit of the classical Landau's results [\cite=Lan67] one might expect that the upper Beurling dimension of Λ should in fact be equal to α. A result of this type was proved in [\cite=DHSW11], where the authors showed that for certain self-similar measures μ, if E(Λ) is a frame in L2(μ) and if the set Λ is assumed to enjoy a certain structure, then the upper Beurling dimension of Λ indeed coincides with the fractal dimension of the measure.

However, in general this is not the case. As a simple example one may take μ to be the arc length measure on the segment   ×  {0} in [formula]. Then μ is a one-dimensional measure, and it is easy to verify that if [formula] then the system E(Λ) constitutes an orthonormal basis in L2(μ). Nevertheless, the estimate

[formula]

holds for all sufficiently large r, and in particular, the upper Beurling dimension of Λ is zero. In a similar way one can construct examples of this type in [formula] for any [formula]. See also [\cite=DHL13] where such an example for fractal measures on [formula] was given.

On the other hand, if we impose extra assumptions on the measure μ, then we can show that if E(Λ) is a frame in L2(μ) then [\eqref=eq_C2.1.2] cannot hold for arbitrarily small α.

For a real number β, [formula], consider the following condition: there exists a function φ∈L2(μ), [formula], such that

[formula]

for some positive constant C. Notice that φμ is a (non-zero) finite, complex measure on [formula], since φ∈L2(μ) and μ is a finite measure.

It is known that (at least, for non-negative φ) the condition [\eqref=eq_C2.1.7] implies that the measure φμ cannot charge any compact set of Hausdorff dimension smaller than β (see for example [\cite=Mat15]). This means, intuitively, that μ has "at least one component of dimension not less than β".

A well-known example of a singular measure μ satisfying [\eqref=eq_C2.1.7] for some β > 0 is the area measure on the unit sphere in [formula], or, more generally, on an open subset Ω of a smooth hypersurface in [formula] with everywhere non-vanishing Gaussian curvature. In this case one may take φ to be any smooth function such that the intersection of [formula] with the hypersurface is a compact subset of Ω, and the estimate [\eqref=eq_C2.1.7] then holds with β = d - 1 (see e.g. [\cite=Ste93]).

It should be mentioned that the theory of Salem sets is concerned with various constructions of sets in [formula] of Hausdorff dimension β which support a measure μ satisfying [\eqref=eq_C2.1.7]. See [\cite=Mat15] and the references mentioned there.

Suppose that a system of exponentials E(Λ) is a frame in L2(μ), where μ is a measure satisfying [\eqref=eq_C2.1.7] for some β, [formula]. If there is a constant C such that

[formula]

then we must have

[formula]

By assumption there exists a function φ∈L2(μ), [formula], such that the (non-zero, finite, complex) measure ν: = φμ satisfies

[formula]

We also assume that the system E(Λ) is a frame in L2(μ). Then applying the lower frame inequality to the functions [formula] [formula] yields

[formula]

Suppose now to the contrary that [\eqref=eq_C2.2.1] does hold for some α such that

[formula]

Then this allows us to choose a number γ satisfying

[formula]

Given a large number R we define T: = Rγ and consider the union of balls B(λ,T) of radius T centered at the points [formula]. Then the d-dimensional volume of the union of these balls is not greater than

[formula]

due to [\eqref=eq_C2.2.1] and [\eqref=eq_C2.2.6]. Hence if R is sufficiently large then these ball cannot cover B(0,R / 2). So we may find a point t0∈B(0,R / 2) such that [formula], [formula]. We will show that the inequality [\eqref=eq_C2.2.3] is then violated at this point t0.

Indeed, we have

[formula]

according to [\eqref=eq_C2.2.1] and [\eqref=eq_C2.2.2]. We also have

[formula]

where we have used [\eqref=eq_C2.2.1], [\eqref=eq_C2.2.2] and the fact that [\eqref=eq_C2.2.5] implies that α  <  β. It follows that

[formula]

Due to [\eqref=eq_C2.2.6] we have α  -  γβ < 0, hence the right hand side of [\eqref=eq_C2.2.7] can be made as small as we wish provided that R is chosen sufficiently large. But this contradicts [\eqref=eq_C2.2.3], and so the lemma is proved.

We can now combine the previous lemmas to obtain the main result of this section, which establishes a pure type principle for singular continuous measures.

Let μ be a measure on [formula] which satisfies both conditions [\eqref=eq_C2.1.1] and [\eqref=eq_C2.1.7] for some [formula]. If

[formula]

then L2(μ) does not admit a Fourier frame.

We view this result as a pure type principle, since the assumptions mean, intuitively, that μ has both a component of dimension not greater than α, and (in a certain strong sense) a component of dimension not less than β, and the conclusion is that μ cannot have a Fourier frame if α and β are sufficiently far apart.

Suppose to the contrary that L2(μ) does have a frame E(Λ). Then by Lemma [\ref=lem_C2.1] the set Λ must satisfy [\eqref=eq_C2.1.2]. In turn, Lemma [\ref=lem_C2.2] implies that the numbers α, β must satisfy the relation [\eqref=eq_C2.2.4]. However this contradicts [\eqref=eq_C3.1.1].

As an application of Theorem [\ref=thm_C3.1], we can conclude the following result:

Let μ be a measure on [formula] [formula] which is the sum of the area measure on an open subset of a smooth k-dimensional submanifold, where

[formula]

and the area measure on an open subset of a smooth hypersurface with everywhere non-vanishing Gaussian curvature. Then L2(μ) does not admit a Fourier frame.

Here [formula] denotes the greatest integer which is less than or equal to a real number x.

The assumptions imply that the measure μ satisfies condition [\eqref=eq_C2.1.1] with α = k (see [\cite=Str90a]) and condition [\eqref=eq_C2.1.7] with β = d - 1 (see [\cite=Ste93]). Moreover, it follows from [\eqref=eq_C3.2.1] that condition [\eqref=eq_C3.1.1] is satisfied for these values of α and β. Hence the assertion follows from Theorem [\ref=thm_C3.1].

In the special case when k = 1 in Theorem [\ref=thm_C3.2] we obtain Theorem [\ref=thm_A2.2].

Fourier frames for surface measures

In the previous section we proved that if a measure μ in [formula] is the sum of the area measure on a k-dimensional submanifold (at least, for k not too large) and the area measure on a hypersurface with non-vanishing Gaussian curvature, then μ does not have a Fourier frame. Our main goal in the present section is to show that in many examples, a Fourier frame does exist for each "pure" component of such a measure separately.

We will consider a measure μ in [formula] which is the area measure on a k-dimensional submanifold defined as a graph. Let [formula] [formula] be a smooth function defined on an open set [formula]. Let E be a compact subset of U, and let

[formula]

be the graph of φ over E. Then Γ is a compact subset of a k-dimensional submanifold in [formula], and so it admits an area measure μ induced from its embedding in [formula]. The measure μ can be defined by the requirement that

[formula]

for every continuous function f on Γ, where [formula] is an appropriate smooth weight function determined by the function φ. Actually, it will be sufficient for us to assume that w(x) is an arbitrary continuous, strictly positive function on E.

The measure μ on [formula] defined by [\eqref=eq_D1.1.2] has a Fourier frame.

In fact, it will be easy to verify that if δ > 0 is sufficiently small and if

[formula]

then the system E(Λ) is a frame in L2(μ). Indeed, fix δ > 0 small enough such that E is contained in the k-dimensional cube

[formula]

and let Λ be defined by [\eqref=eq_D1.1.3]. Given f∈L2(μ), we have

[formula]

where the last equality is true with a certain constant C  =  C(k,δ) since the exponential system [formula] forms an orthogonal basis in the space L2(Ikδ), and since E is contained in Ikδ. On the other hand, we have

[formula]

Since w(x) is a continuous, strictly positive function on the compact set E, it is bounded from above and from below on E. Hence the ratio between [\eqref=eq_D1.1.5] and [\eqref=eq_D1.1.6] is also bounded from above and from below by certain constants not depending on f. This confirms that the system E(Λ) is indeed a frame in L2(μ).

In the case when k = d - 1, the function φ is scalar-valued, and Γ is then a subset of a hypersurface in [formula]. It should be mentioned that the requirement in Theorem [\ref=thm_C3.2] that the hypersurface has non-vanishing Gaussian curvature is easy to express in terms of the function φ: this is the case if and only if the (d - 1)  ×  (d - 1) matrix given by

[formula]

is invertible at every point x∈U.

Open problems

Finally we mention some questions concerning possible extensions of our results.

Notice that Theorem [\ref=thm_B2.1] allows us to construct "mixed type" measures with a Fourier frame only in dimensions 2 and higher. It would be interesting to know whether examples of this type can be found on [formula] as well. Specifically: can one construct examples of two self-similar Cantor measures μ and ν on [formula] of different dimensions, such that their sum μ  +  ν is a measure with a Fourier frame?

Here the main point in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_B2.1] may still be useful: it would be enough to show that given any positive number q there is a set Λμ, such that the exponential system E(Λμ) is a frame in L2(μ) with lower frame bound not less than q, and at the same time E(Λμ) constitutes a Bessel system in L2(ν) with Bessel constant bounded from above independently of q; and similarly, to show that there is also a set Λν such that the system E(Λν) has the same properties but with the roles of μ and ν interchanged. Indeed, in this case the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_B2.1] shows that a frame E(Λ) for L2(μ  +  ν) can be obtained by choosing q sufficiently large and taking [formula].

It would also be interesting to understand to what extent Theorem [\ref=thm_C3.1] is sharp. Can the requirement [\eqref=eq_C3.1.1] be relaxed to α  <  β ? Analogously, can one relax the requirement [\eqref=eq_C3.2.1] in Theorem [\ref=thm_C3.2] to [formula] ?

In the same spirit, one may ask whether it is possible to get a version of Theorem [\ref=thm_C3.2] for two submanifolds in [formula] of different dimensions, but such that not necessarily one of the dimensions is equal to d - 1. What geometric condition would replace the curvature requirement in such a result? (We know that some condition of this sort is necessary, due to Theorem [\ref=thm_B2.2].)

Another question is concerned with the assumption in Theorem [\ref=thm_D1.1] that the submanifold is globally contained in the graph of some function. Can this assumption be removed? In particular, we do not know whether the area measure on the unit sphere

[formula]

has a Fourier frame [formula]. (Theorem [\ref=thm_D1.1] only tells us that the restriction of the area measure to a sufficiently small spherical cap admits such a frame.)
