Introduction

One of key science drivers of large spectroscopic galaxy surveys is to unveil the nature of dark energy (DE), the unknown energy component with a negative pressure to drive the accelerating expansion of the Universe [\citep=Riess] [\citep=Perlmutter]. The equation-of-state (EoS) function w(z), which is the ratio of pressure over energy density of DE and is a function of redshift z in general, is a proxy linking the nature of DE and its phenomenological features which can be probed by observations. For instance, a observational confirmation of w =  - 1 may suggest that DE is essentially vacuum energy, while a time-evolving w can be a sign of new physics, e.g., dynamical dark energy scenarios [\citep=quintessence1] [\citep=quintessence2] [\citep=phantom] [\citep=quintom] [\citep=kessence], or a breakdown of general relativity on cosmological scales (see [\citealt=MGreview] for a recent review of modified gravity theories). Therefore reconstructing w(z) directly from data is an efficient way for DE studies [\citep=DEreview] [\citep=Zhao12] [\citep=DErecon06].

The function w(z) of DE leaves imprints on the cosmic background expansion history, which can be probed by the effect of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measured from galaxies surveys [\citep=Eisenstein05] [\citep=Cole2005], besides other probes including supernovae Type Ia (SN Ia) [\citep=Riess] [\citep=Perlmutter], cosmic microwave background (CMB) [\citep=planck15] and so forth. BAO is a characteristic three-dimensional clustering pattern of galaxies at about 150 Mpc on the comoving scale, due to sound waves generated by the photon-baryon coupling in the early universe [\citep=PY70] [\citep=SZ70] [\citep=EH98]. The BAO distance is traditionally measured using two-point correlation functions or power spectrum of galaxies. Recent studies find that higher-order statistics of galaxies [\citep=BAO3pt], or two-point clustering of voids can also be used for BAO measurements [\citep=voidBAO]. Since the BAO scale is sensitive to cosmic geometry and it is largely immune to systematics [\citep=imsys], BAO is widely used as the 'standard ruler' to calibrate the Universe.

Under assumptions that the BAO scale is the same in all directions with respect to the line-of-sight (l.o.s.) of the observer, one can probe the isotropic, one-dimensional (1D) BAO signal [formula], where DA(z) and H(z) are the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter at an effective redshift z of the galaxy sample, using the monopole of the correlation function of power spectrum of galaxies in redshift space.

In fact, DA(z) and H(z) can be separately measured when higher-order multipoles, e.g., the quadrupole and hexadecapole, are included in the analysis. This is due to the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect [\citep=AP]: if one uses a wrong cosmology to convert redshifts into distances for the clustering analysis, the scales along and cross the l.o.s. will be dilated differently, which produces a measurable effect to break the degeneracy between DA and H in the anisotropic, two-dimensional (2D) BAO analysis. The 2D BAO distances are more challenging to measure, but it is much more informative for DE studies because w(z) is closely related to the first derivative of H(z), but to the second derivative of DV(z).

The 1D and 2D BAO signals have been detected by a number of large galaxy surveys including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) [\citep=Eisenstein05] [\citep=Percival10] [\citep=DR9] [\citep=BAODR11] [\citep=Gil-Mar] [\citep=Cuesta] [\citep=Acacia] [\citep=Beutler16a] [\citep=Beutler16b] [\citep=Ross16], the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) [\citep=Cole2005], WiggleZ [\citep=wigglez] [\citep=2012arXiv1210.2130P], the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) [\citep=6dF] and so on. The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) [\citep=BOSS], part of SDSS III project [\citep=SDSS3], has reached percent level BAO measurements at zeff = 0.32 and zeff = 0.57 [\citep=BAODR11] [\citep=Gil-Mar] [\citep=Cuesta] [\citep=Beutler16a] [\citep=Ross16] using the 'low-redshift' (LOWZ; 0.15 < z < 0.43) and 'constant stellar mass' samples (CMASS; 0.43 < z < 0.7) of Data Release (DR) 12 [\citep=Alam] .

It is true that using galaxies across wide redshift ranges can yield a precise BAO measurement at a single effective redshift, but this does not capture the tomographic information in redshift, which is required for the study of w(z). Subdividing the galaxy sample into a small number of independent redshift slices and perform the BAO analysis in each slice can in principle recover the temporal information to some extent (see [\citealt=CF_4bins] for a 4-bin BAO analysis of the BOSS DR12 sample). However, as the slice number increases, galaxies in each slice decrease, and we are at a risk of ending up with a seriously biased measurement due to large systematic uncertainties.

One possible solution is to perform the BAO analysis in overlapping redshift slices. This on one hand guarantees the sufficiency of galaxy numbers in each subsample, on the other hand, it allows for a higher temporal resolution. In this work, we perform such a tomographic BAO analysis in Fourier space using the DR12 galaxy sample, and quantify the gain in dark energy studies.

This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe the BOSS DR12 galaxy catalogues used for our analysis, and in Section 3, we perform a Fisher matrix forecast on this sample to determine the redshift binning, and present the power spectrum measurements. We perform the BAO analysis in Section 4, and apply our measurement to dark energy studies in Section 5, before we conclude in Section 6.

The BOSS DR12 Combined Sample

The BOSS program covers near 10, 000 square degrees of the sky using a 2.5 metre-aperture Sloan Foundation Telescope [\citep=SDSStelescope] at the Apache Point Observatory (APO) in New Mexico. The BOSS team has obtained spectra of more than 1.5 million galaxies brighter than i = 19.9 and approximately 170, 000 new quasars with redshifts 2.1  ≤  z  ≤  3.5 to a depth of g < 22 using the improved double-armed spectrographs in a wavelength range of 3,600   <  λ < 10,000 . The filter, spectrograph and pipeline of BOSS are described in [\citet=ugrizFilter] [\citet=BOSSpipeline] [\citet=BOSSspectro].

The DR12 combined sample is a coherent combination of two distinct targets, LOWZ and CMASS. We refer the stellar-mass incompleteness of the LOWZ and CMASS samples to [\citet=Leauthaud16] and its impact on the clustering to [\citet=Saito16] and [\citet=Rodriguez-Torres16]. The DR12 combined catalogue is created from the observational data using the pipeline described in [\citet=Reid16], in which the survey footprint, veto masks and survey systematics are taken into account to produce the data and random catalogues. The redshift range of this sample is 0.2 < z < 0.75, and it contains [formula] and [formula] galaxies in the North Galactic Cap (NGC) ([formula] deg2) and South Galactic Cap (SGC) ([formula] deg2) respectively. The wedge plot (Fig. [\ref=fig:footprint]) visualises the DR12 sample . The redshift distribution of the galaxies in the NGC and SGC is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:nz]. We refer the readers to Table 2 of [\citet=Reid16] for more details of the DR12 combined sample.

For each galaxy in the data catalogue, the following information is provided: the right ascension (RA), declination (DEC), redshift z and a set of weights including a FKP weight [\citep=FKP] wFKP, which is crucial to optimise the signal-to-noise ratio of power spectrum measurements, a systematic weight, wsys to account for systematic effects from the contamination of stars and variations in seeing conditions, a redshift failure weight, wrf to avoid using the galaxy without a robust redshift estimate, and a fibre collision weight, wfc to correct for the clustering signal on small scales due to the fibre collision. With all the weights accounted for, each individual galaxy is counted as an effective number of,

[formula]

More details of the weights are described in [\citet=imsys] [\citet=BAODR11] [\citet=Ross16].

For the clustering analysis, the auxiliary random catalogues, whose spatial and redshift distributions match those of data catalogues but without any clustering structure, are required. In this analysis, we use the random catalogues consisting of 50 times number of galaxies to reduce the sampling noise.

Since we only observe one realisation of the distribution of galaxies in the past lightcone, we need a large number of additional realisations, which can be obtained using numerical simulations, to estimate the data covariance matrix. In this work, we use the MultiDark PATCHY (MD-Patchy) mock catalogues [\citep=patchy], which provide 2048 realisations of galaxy distribution matching the spatial and redshift distributions of the DR12 data sample. These galaxy mocks can accurately recover the input two-point and three-point statistics, and are sufficient for the calibration of data covariance matrix for this analysis.

Given RA, DEC and z, the Cartesian coordinates of the concerning galaxy, and hence the distances between galaxy pairs can be calculated, given a fiducial cosmology. It is true that the final BAO measurement is independent of the fiducial cosmology used for the redshift-distance conversion, and in the production of mock catalogues, we choose the same cosmological parameters used in the MD-Patchy mocks for convenience, i.e.,

[formula]

which is consistent with the Planck cosmology [\citep=planck15].

Tomographic BAO measurements

Preparations

To ensure a robust BAO distant measurement within each redshift slice while maximising the tomographic information, we employ a Fisher matrix forecast following the method developed in [\citet=BAOFisher]. Using the k modes up to 0.3  h  Mpc- 1 for the BAO analysis without the reconstruction process [\citep=BAOrecon], we require that the precision of the isotropic BAO distance measurement within each redshift bin is better than 3%, while for the anisotropic BAO measurement, the precision on DA and H within each bin is no worse than 4% and 8% respectively. We allow for the overlapping between neighbouring redshift bins to be 75% maximal, which well balances the redshift resolution and the complementarity of the information between overlapping bins. This yields a binning scheme visualised in Fig [\ref=fig:nz] and in Table [\ref=tab:zbins]. As shown, the entire sample is subdivided into nine bins, with the maximal overlapping to be 73%. The BAO projection result in Table [\ref=tab:zbins] satisfies the requirement mentioned above, i.e., the worst isotropic and anisotropic BAO distance measurement is predicted to be 2.4% (DV), 2.9% (DA) and 7% (H) respectively. The predicted 68 and 95% confidence level (CL) contours between DA and H using galaxies in nine bins are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:DA_H_Fisher]. The black solid curve illustrates the fiducial model.

The interpolation scheme

The first step for the P(k) multipole measurement is to assign the galaxies and randoms to a regular Cartesian grid, and choose an interpolation scheme to obtain a smoothed overdensity field for the Fourier analysis in next steps.

In this work, we embed the entire survey volume into a cubic box with L  =  5000  h- 1  Mpc a side , and the box is subdivided into N3g = 10243 cubic cells. To obtain the smoothed overdensity field, an interpolation scheme is needed for the mass assignment. It is well known that the aliasing problem is inevitable in Fourier analysis, but choosing a suitable interpolation scheme (with corrections after the Fourier transformation; see discussions later) can largely reduce the aliasing to a negligible level at the scale for the BAO analysis.

The tradition interpolation schemes include the Nearest-Grid-Point (NGP), Cloud-in-Cell (CIC), Triangular-Shaped-Cloud (TSC) and so on. These correspond to the first, second and third order B-spline interpolation. The higher order it is, the less level of aliasing survives after the correction [\citep=interlacing] [\citep=Jing05].

Recently, [\citet=interlacing] find that using the fourth-order B-spline, also called the Piecewise Cubic Spline (PCS) interpolation can suppress the aliasing effect to a level below 0.1% even at the Nyquist scale after the correction. In this work, we follow [\citet=interlacing] and use the PCS interpolation to calculate the overdensity field on the grid, i.e., we convolve the raw overdensity field with the following window function in real space,

[formula]

This means that the overdensity in each cell is contributed by galaxies and randoms in its NPCS = 53 neighbouring cells .

After the interpolation, we obtain an overdensity field [formula],

[formula]

where N is a normalisation factor which can be computed using the random catalogue [\citep=FKP],

[formula]

The summation here is over NR samples in the random catalogue. The quantity wT is the total weight for the concerning galaxy given in Eq ([\ref=eq:weight]), nG and nR are the number density at position [formula] of the galaxy and random catalogues respectively, γ is the ratio between the total sample numbers of the galaxy (NG) and random (NR) catalogues, i.e., γ  =  NG / NR and in this work [formula].

The estimator for [formula]

To measure the power spectrum multipole, we need to perform Fourier transformations of the overdensity field [formula] defined in Eq ([\ref=eq:Delta]) [\citep=Yamamoto]. Specifically, we need to calculate the following quantity,

[formula]

for every [formula] mode. This integral was recently found to be evaluable using Fast Fourier Transformations (FFTs) [\citep=FFTPk] [\citep=FFTPk2] instead of the expensive direct summation. We use the CAPSS package which requires the FFTW library to perform the Fourier transformations to obtain F0,F2 and F4, which is the ingredient for the measurement of the monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole moments of the galaxy power spectrum in redshift space.

Given [formula], the power spectrum moments can be calculated as, ,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where S is the shot noise term, which can be calculated as,

[formula]

The quantity ζ is the probability that a close pair of galaxies corrected by the fibre collision weight is a true pair. We set ζ to be 0.5 following the study in [\citet=fcweight]. Note that for brevity, we have dropped the dependence of all the weights on location [formula] for the ith galaxy or random sample in Eq ([\ref=eq:sn]).

As mentioned earlier, the aliasing problem exists for all FFT-related manipulations, and it must be corrected for, especially close to the Nyquist scale. Here we follow [\citet=Jing05] to correct for the aliasing effect analytically, i.e., we divide each [formula] mode by the following correction factor for the PCS interpolation,

[formula]

where i runs over three dimensions, and kN is the Nyquist scale, kN  =  πNg / L which is [formula] in our case. After the anti-aliasing correction, the level of aliasing is negligible ( < 0.1%) on scales of interest (k < 0.3  h  Mpc- 1) of our analysis.

The result of the [formula] measurement

The measurement of P0(k),P2(k) and P4(k) for the galaxies in nine redshift slices in the NGC and SGC are shown as data points in Figs [\ref=fig:pk_ngc] and [\ref=fig:pk_sgc] respectively. Our measurement is in 30 k bins linearly spaced between k = 0 to k = 0.3  h  Mpc- 1. To quantify the uncertainty, we perform the same measurement on the MD-Patchy mocks, and compute the mean (shown as solid curves) and standard deviation (shown as error bars and shaded error bands) of the [formula] measured in each k bin of the 2048 mocks. We find that although the measurements in the NGC and SGC are in general consistent with each other, an offset exists. This may be due to the slightly different selections used for the observations in two hemispheres. For more details of the discussion on the NGC-SGC discrepancy, we refer the readers to the companion papers of [\citet=Acacia] [\citet=Beutler16a] [\citet=Jan16].

The data covariance matrix

The covariance between the ith k bin of the [formula]th order multipole in the mth redshift bin, and the jth k bin of the [formula]th order multipole in the nth redshift bin can be calculated as follows,

[formula]

where the overbars denote the average value, i.e.,

[formula]

Here Nmock = 2048 is the number of mocks used.

Note that the estimated covariance matrix using mocks needs to be corrected for a bias using the Hartlap factor [\citep=Hartlap],

[formula]

where Nb is the number of k bins. The correction is unbiased if the error distribution of the data is Gaussian, which is only true when Nmock  ≫  Nb so that fH is close to 1. For covariance between k bins within the same redshift slice, even if P0,P2 and P4 are all included, Nb = 90, and fH = 0.956. For the covariance between k bins in two different redshift slices, fH reduces to 0.912, which is also sufficiently close to 1.

Figs [\ref=fig:corr_ngc] and [\ref=fig:corr_sgc] show the correlation matrix (the normalised covariance matrix so that all the diagonal elements are 1) for P0,P2,P4 within the same redshift slice in the NGC and SGC respectively, and Fig [\ref=fig:corr_all] presents the full correlation matrix among all the redshift slices. The structure of these matrices is as follows:

Multipoles with the same order positively correlate in general;

Multipoles with different orders correlate more on the same scales;

Multipoles in neighbouring redshift slices correlate, and the correlation generally decreases as the separation in redshift decreases;

Multipoles in non-overlapping redshift slices do not correlate at all.

All of these observations make perfect sense intuitively.

The BAO analysis

In this section, we shall measure the isotropic and anisotropic BAO signals from the P(k) multipoles and the data covariance matrix. To begin with, we describe the theoretical models, i.e., the BAO templates, for the analysis, followed by details of the fitting procedure and results.

The template for the isotropic BAO analysis

The isotropic BAO position is parametrised by the scale dilation parameter α,

[formula]

where the volume distance DV(z) is defined in terms of the angular diameter distance DA(z) and the Hubble parameter, H(z), i.e., [formula], and rd is the comoving sound horizon at the drag epoch. Quantities with the super- or subscript 'fid' are for the fiducial model parametrised by Eq ([\ref=eq:fid]). The template for the isotropic BAO is [\citep=Eisenstein07] [\citep=Beutler16a],

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where Plin(k) is the linear power spectrum calculated using CAMB [\citep=CAMB], Pnw,lin is the linear power spectrum with the BAO feature removed [\citep=EH98], F(k,Σs) is the velocity damping term to account for the small scale Fingers-of-God (FoG) effect, B is an overall constant for the effect of galaxy bias and redshift space distortions (RSD), ΣNL quantifies the nonlinear damping scale of the oscillations. We fix ΣNL to be 3.3  h- 1  Mpc, which is motivated by numeric simulations [\citep=DJE07] [\citep=Seo15]. The theoretical model for the monopole is,

[formula]

where k' = k / α. The polynomials are included here to account for systematic effects [\citep=BAODR11] [\citep=Acacia]. Once the parameters α,B,Σs,a0i are known, one can use Eq ([\ref=eq:P0]) to obtain a theoretical prediction for the monopole for the fitting.

The template for the anisotropic BAO analysis

The BAO feature can also be measured in both the transverse and radial directions, parametrised by [formula] and α|| respectively,

[formula]

The template for the anisotropic BAO is slightly more complicated than the isotropic case due to several l.o.s.-dependent effects. The template is [\citep=Eisenstein07] [\citep=Beutler16a],

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

where

[formula]

Note that α is the isotropic BAO dilation, and ε is the warping factor. Eq ([\ref=eq:AP]) shows the Alcock-Paczynski effect, which is key to allow for the simultaneous determination of DA and H using multipoles of P(k) [\citep=BPH96].

The (1 + βμ2)2 term accounts for the RSD effect on large scales [\citep=Kaiser], and exponential damping term becomes anisotropic in this case. We set [formula] and [formula] motivated by simulations [\citep=Seo15] [\citep=Beutler16a].

In this setup, once the parameter set ([formula]) is known, one can predict [formula] using Eq ([\ref=eq:AP]).

The survey window function

The theoretical model predictions derived using templates Eqs ([\ref=eq:P0]) or ([\ref=eq:AP]) cannot be directly compared to [formula] measurements yet since the theoretical templates do not take into account the fact that the survey volume is irregular, and has a finite size. Ignoring these facts can overestimate the power on large scales, which may yield a biased estimate on the BAO signal.

These effects can be accounted for by convolving the theoretical model prediction with the survey window function. The survey window function is generally anisotropic due to the irregular geometry of the survey volume, thus the window function multipoles need to be evaluated even for the isotropic BAO analysis.

Calculating the window function multipoles and performing the three-dimensional convolution with the theoretical model prediction can be technically challenging and cost expensive. Recently, [\citet=windowpk] developed a new method for the window function evaluation and convolution. This method calculates the window function multipoles in configuration space based on a pair-counting using the random catalogue, correct for the windowing effect in real space, and then transform the result back to Fourier space using one-dimensional Hankel transformations. This is a very efficient and accurate method, thus we follow this approach in this analysis. We first compute the following pair counts in real space using a parallelised tree code in the CAPSS package,

[formula]

The resultant [formula]'s are shown in Fig [\ref=fig:window]. As shown, [formula] vanishes on scales [formula], and this scale is larger in the NGC than in the SCG due to large volume in the NGC. The higher multipoles contribute less in general, which guarantees a convergence result by keeping the first few [formula]'s.

Given the [formula]'s, we compute the corrected galaxy correlation function multipoles as follows [\citep=Beutler16a] [\citep=Beutler16b] [\citep=windowpk],

[formula]

where the [formula]'s are the correlation function multipoles converted from theoretical templates Eqs ([\ref=eq:P0]) or ([\ref=eq:AP]) using a one-dimensional Hankel transformation. Given the [formula]'s, we then perform a one-dimensional inverse Hankel transformation to obtain the window-convolved power spectrum, [formula], using the FFTlog package [\citep=fftlog] .

The pre- and post-convoluted monopole and quadrupole for three redshift bins are shown in Fig [\ref=fig:pk_fftlog]. As expected, the window function reduces the large-scale powers due to the finite volume of the survey, and the damping effect from the SGC window function is larger due to the fact that the volume in the SGC is smaller than that in the NGC.

The MCMC BAO fitting

We constrain the BAO parameters for each redshift slices using a modified version of CosmoMC [\citep=cosmomc] , which is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) engine. We sample the parameter space for the parameter vector [formula] by minimising the following χ2,

[formula]

where [formula] is the inverse of the data covariance matrix. Note that when using both the NGC and SGC data for the constraint, we use two separate B parameters for the NGC and SGC to account for the offset discussed earlier. We analytically marginalise over the coefficients of polynomials in each MCMC step, i.e., we calculate the optimal values of the coefficients given a set of parameters to minimise the χ2,

[formula]

where the residue vector [formula] is defined as

[formula]

and the polynomial vector X is,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Given [formula] and [formula] at each MCMC step, our aim is to analytically determine the coefficients vector [formula] to minimise χ2. To do this, we expand Eq ([\ref=eq:chi2_c]), and setting [formula] yields,

[formula]

This procedure can avoid fitting these weakly constrained nuisance parameters, making the MCMC chains much easier to converge.

After the MCMC chains converge, we perform statistics on the chain elements to obtain the posterior distribution of each parameters, and the correlation among parameters. Note that the data covariance matrix estimated from the finite mocks inevitably has errors, which have propagated into the errors of parameters. To correct, we follow [\citet=Percival] to rescale the variance of each parameter by

[formula]

where Np is the number of parameters, and

[formula]

Mock tests

We first validate our pipeline by performing the BAO analysis on the MD-Patchy mocks. We fit the isotropic, and anisotropic BAO parameters to the average of 2048 mocks. The isotropic BAO test is shown in Table [\ref=tab:isobao] and Fig [\ref=fig:alpha] (red dashed curves for one-dimensional posterior distribution of α). As shown in the left part of Table [\ref=tab:isobao], the mean value of α's are consistent with 1, which is the input value of all the mocks, within 0.3σ in the worst case (for redshift bin z9). This bias could be due to nonlinearities such as the mode-coupling effect on quasi-nonlinear scales [\citep=modecoupling], which can be approximately estimated analytically [\citep=Seo08] [\citep=modecoupling]. The expected shift in α in 9 redshift bins are shown in the ΔαMC column in Table [\ref=tab:isobao], which is 0.17σ in the worst case (for redshift bin z7). To account for this systematic effect conservatively, we include a systematic error budget on α by adding ΔαMC and the shift of the mean α from 1 in quadrature, for the BAO measurements using the galaxy sample, which will be presented later.

The mock test results for anisotropic BAO are shown in Table [\ref=tab:2dbaomock] and in Fig [\ref=fig:bao2d_mock], where the result using monopole and quadrupole (P0 + P2), and monopole, quadrupole, and hexadecapole separately (P0 + P2 + P4). As show, the hexadecapole improves the constraint in all redshift bins, i.e.,

It shrinks the statistical error budget by 9 - 15% for α||, and 8 - 11% for [formula];

It generally makes the mean value of both α|| and [formula] more consistent with unity;

It reduces the degeneracy between α|| and [formula] by 18 - 32%.

This means that the hexadecapole from DR12 sample is indeed informative for BAO studies. It is true that given the level of uncertainty of P4(k), the BAO feature is barely visible. However, it can improve the global fitting by providing constraints on the amplitude parameters B and the RSD parameter β, thus reduce the degeneracy between α|| and [formula], and improve their constraints indirectly. Given the importance of the hexadecapole, we shall include it in all the analysis in this work unless otherwise mentioned.

We quantify the systematic error budget similarly to the isotropic BAO case, i.e., the systematic error is estimated using the quadrature addition between the bias caused by the mode-coupling effect, and the shift of mean α|| and [formula] from unity. The mode-coupling bias is taken to be ΔαMC|| = 0.001 and [formula] [\citep=Ross16]. This yields a 0.15 - 0.76% systematic error on α||, and 0.09 - 0.1% on [formula].

In summary, we validate our pipeline using mock tests, namely, the bias introduced by the pipeline is sufficiently small compared to the statistical error in all cases, and the bias is accounted for by the systematic error budget.

BAO measurements from DR12 sample

In this section, we shall apply our BAO analysis pipeline on the DR12 sample, and present the main results of this paper.

Isotropic BAO measurements

The isotropic BAO fitting result is shown in the right part of Table [\ref=tab:isobao] and in Figs [\ref=fig:bao_ratio] and [\ref=fig:alpha] (black solid). Fig [\ref=fig:bao_ratio] displays the best-fit monopole and data points, divided by the smoothed power spectrum. As shown, the BAO signal is well extracted in all the redshift slices. From Table [\ref=tab:isobao] and Fig [\ref=fig:alpha], which shows the one-dimensional posterior distribution of α, in comparison to those measured from the mocks, we see that the isotropic BAO distance is determined at a precision of 1.5% to 3.4%, depending on the effective redshifts. We also notice that α in three redshift slices deviate from 1 at [formula] level. This may suggest that the fiducial cosmology, which is the ΛCDM model with parameters listed in Eq ([\ref=eq:fid]), might be in tension with the DR12 galaxy sample. We shall explore this more in a companion paper [\citep=Zhao16].

Anisotropic BAO measurements

The anisotropic BAO measurements are presented in Tables [\ref=tab:anisobao], Figs [\ref=fig:baoring] to [\ref=fig:DM_H]. Table [\ref=tab:anisobao] shows the constraint on α|| and [formula], DA / rd and H rd at nine effective redshifts with the correlation coefficients and the reduced χ2 to quantify the goodness-of-fit. We can see that the anisotropic BAO distances in terms of DA / rd and H rd are measured to a precision of 1.8% - 4.2% and 3.7%  -  7.5% respectively, depending on the effective redshifts. The reduced χ2 is sufficiently close to unity in all cases, which means that the fitting result is as expected. We also notice that the α's show deviation from 1 at [formula] level, which is consistent with the result of the isotropic BAO measurement.

Fig [\ref=fig:bao2d_data] shows the contour plots between α|| and [formula] using galaxies in the NGC (unfilled black) and NGC+SGC (filled blue). These results show that the BAO distances measured from the NGC and SGC are in general consistent with each other, and complimentary. In the two-dimensional plane, we see the deviation from the fiducial model (shown as white crosses) at [formula] level only in the fourth redshift slice.

Fig [\ref=fig:DA_H_gal] shows the contour plots of DA / rd and H rd, together with the prediction of the fiducial model. Comparing with Fig [\ref=fig:DA_H_Fisher], we find that the degeneracy between DA / rd and H rd are consistent with the forecast, while the uncertainties are generally larger, especially for the first and last two bins. This is expected as it is well known that the Fisher forecast, which assumes the Gaussian distribution of parameters, and ignores the systematic effects in the catalogue, can underestimate the errors. Thus we only take the forecast result as a rough guidance for the analysis.

Fig [\ref=fig:baoring] visualises the two-dimensional BAO ring in the third redshift slice. The quantity shown in the colours is the two-dimensional power spectrum, which is assembled from our measured P0,P2 and P4, i.e.,

[formula]

To visualise the BAO ring, we divide P(k,μ) by the smoothed power spectrum Psm(k,μ).

Fig [\ref=fig:alpha_z] shows the constraints on the α's as a function of redshift and in Fig [\ref=fig:alpha_compare], we compare our measurement to the companion paper performing the same tomographic BAO analysis in configuration space [\citep=tomoBAO-xi]. Although the results are in general consistent with each other within the 68% CL bound, the difference exists especially for α|| and [formula], which may be explained as follows,

[\citet=tomoBAO-xi] uses the monopole and quadrupole of the correlation function, while in this work we use the hexadecapole in addition. As discussed in Sec. [\ref=sec:mock], the hexadecapole is sufficiently informative to improve the BAO constraint, and to reduce the theoretical systematics;

Although the correlation function and power spectrum have the same information of BAO in the ideal case (i.e., a survey with an infinite volume without shot noise), a difference is expected for a realistic galaxy survey.

The companion paper [\citet=Salazar16] performs a similar tomographic BAO analysis, but using different observables and pipeline. [\citet=Salazar16] measured the projected two-dimensional angular correlation functions instead in a larger number of redshift slices, and obtained both the BAO and RSD parameters. This method avoids the necessity of choosing a fiducial cosmological model to convert redshifts to distances, which can reduce theoretical systematics in principle, but may be subject to the issue of information loss due to the projection effect, unless a large number of tomographic bins are used [\citep=Asorey12].

Companion papers [\citet=Acacia] [\citet=Beutler16a] [\citet=Ross16] [\citet=Jan16] [\citet=Sanchez16] perform the BAO measurements using the same galaxy catalogue but in three redshift slices of 0.2 < z < 0.5, 0.4 < z < 0.6 and 0.5 < z < 0.75. We compare our result to the 'DR12 Consensus' result presented in [\citet=Acacia] since it is coherently compiled from a range of BAO measurements mentioned above, thus we expect it to be least affected by systematics.

An overplot of the DR12 Consensus measurement and ours is shown in Fig [\ref=fig:DM_H], with the Planck2015 measurement (mean and 68, 95% CL errors) shown in blue bands, where [formula]. A direct one-to-one comparison is impossible simply because our measurements are performed at six additional effective redshifts. The only way for the comparison is to downgrade the redshift resolution of our measurement into three effective redshifts. We follow the procedure presented in [\citet=Sanchez16b] for the data compression, and find an agreement within 68% CL. The comparison is also illustrated in Table 9 and Fig 13 in [\citet=Acacia].

In order to use our 9-bin tomographic BAO measurement for cosmology, the correlation between redshift bins needs to be quantified. For this purpose, we jointly fit the anisotropic BAO distances in all pairs of overlapping redshift bins, i.e., jointly fit [formula] with other nuisance parameters marginalised over where i = 1:8; j = i + 1:9, and calculate the correlation matrix using the MCMC chain elements. The resultant correlation matrix is shown in Fig [\ref=fig:corr_zbins]. As shown, the correlation of the same quantity between redshift bins is positive, and decreases as the redshift separation increases, which is expected. The electronic dataset of measurements presented in this work is available online at .

Dark energy implications

In this section, we utilise our tomographic BAO measurements to constrain the equation-of-state (EoS) function of dark energy, w, parametrised in the CPL form, [\citep=CP] [\citep=Linder],

[formula]

where a is the scale factor of the Universe. We constrain w0,wa together with other basic cosmological parameters including the physical baryon energy density Ωbh2, the physical cold dark matter energy density Ωch2, the ratio between the angular diameter distance and sound horizon at recombination Θs, the amplitude and power index of the primordial power spectrum As and ns respectively.

Besides the BAO data, we combine with the CMB measurement from the Planck mission [\citep=planck15] including the auto- and cross-angular power spectrum of the temperature and polarisation fluctuations of the CMB photons, the supernovae Type Ia sample of JLA [\citep=JLA], the galaxy power spectra from the WiggleZ survey [\citep=wigglez], and the tomographic measurement of the weak lensing shear angular power spectra provided by the CFHTLenS team [\citep=cfhtlens]. We pay particular attention to the dark energy perturbations when w(a) crosses the - 1 boundary [\citep=DEP] [\citep=Fang08]. We use CosmoMC to sample the 7-dimensional parameter space and perform statistical analysis on the Markov chains after the perfect convergence of the sampling process.

The result is visually shown in Fig [\ref=fig:CPL2], where the 68 and 95% CL contours of w0,wa are plotted for two different data combinations ('Base' means a data combination of Planck, JLA, WiggleZ and CFHTLenS). The constraints using our nine-bin tomographic BAO measurements and the three-bin DR12 consensus measurements are consistent well within 68% CL, while tomographic BAO measurements yield a slightly tighter constraint due to the additional tomographic information in redshift, namely,

[formula]

To quantify the improvement on dark energy parameters using tomographic BAO measurement, we also compare to a test case, in which we maximally remove the tomographic information by compressing our nine-bin BAO measurements into a single datapoint at effective redshift zeff = 0.475. We also take out the JLA, WiggleZ and CFHTLenS data from the Base dataset to investigate the strength of the DR12 BAO data more explicitly. The result is shown in Fig [\ref=fig:CPL],

[formula]

With tomographic BAO, the 68% CL marginalised errors on w0 and wa are reduced by 14% and 16% respectively, and the Figure-of-Merit (FoM), which is the reciprocal of the area of the 68% CL w0,wa contour, is improved by 29%.

Tomographic BAO measurements are more informative in terms of the redshift evolution of DA and H, which are closely related to the time evolution of w. For future galaxy surveys which cover a wider redshift range, the improvement on FoM is expected to be more significant.

Conclusion

The physics of baryonic acoustic oscillations has been well established to be a robust tool for cosmological studies. Specifically, the BAO measurements make it possible to reconstruct the history of the cosmic expansion, which is key to reveal the physics of the accelerating expansion of the Universe, and the nature of dark energy.

Obtaining BAO measurements at as many as possible redshifts is ideal for tracing the cosmic expansion history. However, extracting the time evolution of the BAO signal is technically challenging. Naïvely subdividing the galaxies into multiple independent redshift slices and performing BAO measurements in each slice is a straightforward solution, but the number of slices has to be limited to a small number, otherwise each individual slice would contain too few galaxies to enable a robust BAO measurement due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and issues of systematics.

In this work, we solve this problem using multiple overlapping redshift slices, which allows for extracting the redshift information of the BAO signal in a large number of redshift slices. We exploit the completed DR12 combined galaxy sample of the BOSS survey, and obtain tomographic BAO measurements in nine overlapping redshift slices using the pre-reconstructed galaxy power spectrum multipoles up to the hexadecapole, after validating our data analysis pipeline using the MD-Patchy mock galaxy catalogues. Our measurement and likelihood routines compatible with CosmoMC are publicly available.

We compare our measurement to that in a companion paper [\citep=tomoBAO-xi], which performs similar analysis using galaxy correlation functions derived from the same data sample, and find a consistency. For a further comparison, we derive a three-bin BAO measurement by coherently combining our tomographic measurements, and then compare to the BAO measurement presented in another companion paper [\citep=Acacia], and find an agreement. The BAO measurements including the full covariance matrices presented in this work and a CosmoMC patch is available at .

We use our BAO measurements to constrain dark energy equation-of-state parameters, and find that for the CPL parametrisation, the ΛCDM model is favoured by a joint dataset of CMB, supernovae, BAO and weak lensing measurement. A more genetic approach for dark energy studies using our measurement will be explored in a separate publication [\citep=Zhao16].

For the BOSS DR12 sensitivity, we have seen that the dark energy FoM can differ by as much as 29% between cases using tomographic, and non-tomographic BAO measurements. The ongoing and upcoming galaxy redshift surveys, including the eBOSS [\citep=Overview], DESI , Euclid [\citep=Euclid16], PFS [\citep=PFS], and so on, cover a larger and larger cosmic volume, thus there is rich tomographic information in redshifts to be exploited. Besides the method developed in this work, alternatives such as the optimal redshift weighting method [\citep=zweight1] [\citep=zweight2] [\citep=zweight3], are being developed and applied to galaxy surveys.
