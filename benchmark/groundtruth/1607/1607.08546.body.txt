General Electromagnetic Nonminimal Couplings in the Dirac Equation

The Standard Model (SM) structure allows for C, P, and T violations (and combinations) as long as CPT symmetry is preserved. Among the most important tests for physics beyond the SM is the search for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of particles in connection with the strong CP problem.[\cite=Axion] [\cite=LeptonEDM] The EDM nonrelativistic interaction term has the form [formula] with [formula], [formula] and d as the electric field, the spin operator, and the EDM modulus, respectively. This interaction violates both P and T symmetries, [formula], [formula], but preserves C and CPT symmetries. Lorentz-violating nonminimal couplings in the context of the Dirac equation that engender EDM at tree level can be stringently constrained by EDM data.[\cite=Pospelov] [\cite=FredeNM1] [\cite=Jonas1] Theories endowed with Lorentz violation are a possible route for physics beyond SM that has been intensively studied in the latest years, mainly in the context of the Standard-Model Extension (SME).[\cite=SME] [\cite=Sideral] Connections between LV theories and EDM physics have been addressed in Ref. .

In this work, a new class of dimension-five nonminimal couplings is proposed and examined with respect to the possible generation of an EDM and magnetic dipole moment (MDM),[\cite=Jonas2] having the hermiticity as the main criterion to be observed.

Nonminimal couplings in the context of the Dirac equation can be stated by modifying the usual covariant derivative.[\cite=FredeNM1] [\cite=Jonas1] For the cases involving a rank-2, dimensionless, LV tensor Tμν, a first proposal is given by [formula]. Its hermitian version is [formula], which leads to the modified Dirac equation

[formula]

In momentum coordinates, the Dirac equation can be rewritten as [formula] with [formula] being the LV piece of the hamiltonian. Using F0j = Ej,Fmn  =  εmnpBp, σ0j = iαj and σij  =  εijkΣk, the nonrelativistic hamiltonian for uniform fields is

[formula]

with [formula] [formula] We notice that the terms [formula], λ1TijEjσi are able to generate an EDM for the electron at tree level, so that the LV coefficients λ1T00, λ1Tij can be constrained by using EDM experimental data.[\cite=Baron] The generation of MDM is unusual and associated with the term, λ1T0i(σ  ×  B)i, by an unconventional interpretation: if we consider [formula], where σ̃k  =  εijkT0iσj is a kind of "rotated" spin operator by the LV background, we should be able to use the MDM experimental data[\cite=Gabrielse] to impose bounds on the parameter λ1T0i as well (if a suitable experimental set up able to measure MDM in an orthogonal direction to the applied field is found). Table I displays the obtained bounds for this coupling, its non-axial version, and other relevant cases.

The non-axial version of this coupling is given by the following extension to the covariant derivative: [formula], which yields a hermitian contribution to the Dirac equation,

[formula]

implying the hamiltonian LV piece, [formula]. The full nonrelativistic hamiltonian is

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] Clearly, the terms [formula] and TijσjBi are MDM contributions, involving only the symmetric part of the tensor Tμν, whose magnitude can be limited by the known experimental error in the MDM.[\cite=Gabrielse] There is also an unconventional EDM contribution. Analogously to the magnetic case, the term [formula] could be considered as EDM if we take σ̃k  =  εijkT0iσj as a kind of "rotated" EDM. Therefore, EDM and MDM experimental data can be used to constrain these terms, as it is shown in Table I. An interesting discussion concerning the overlapping of some bounds with others in the literature is found in Ref. . For a discussion on the sidereal variations, to which the LV parameters are subject, see Refs. .

The nonminimal couplings of Eqs. ([\ref=DiracM1]) and ([\ref=DiracM2]) enclose two gamma matrices contracted with the background and the Fαβ tensor. New possibilities of couplings arise when the tensors Tμν and Fαβ have no mutually contracted indices, leaving three indices to be contracted with gamma matrices. These derivatives are comprised in the general expression Dμ  =  ∂μ + ieAμ + iλ3T{ανFμβ}γ{βγαγν}, with the symbol {} denoting possible permutation of the indexes μ,ν,α,β. Among them there is

[formula]

This coupling is distinct from the previous ones, leading to the Dirac equation contribution: / 8. In this case, the symmetric part of Tμν yields the usual MDM interaction, [formula]. Taking an antisymmetric Tμν, the modified Dirac equation assumes the form [formula] where the LV piece is [formula]. The EDM and MDM nonrelativistic contributions are

[formula]

In this case, there are unconventional MDM and EDM contributions. The bounds achieved for this model are also included in Table I. It is possible to show that many other couplings involving four gamma matrices are either physically redundant or do not generate spin interactions.[\cite=Jonas2]

In this work, we analyzed a new class of dimension-five, CPT-even LV nonminimal couplings between fermions and photons, composed of a general tensor, Tμν, in the context of the Dirac equation, addressing its axial and non-axial versions. EDM and MDM experimental data were used to impose upper bounds on the LV parameters of 1 part in 1011 and 1016 GeV- 1. The "rotated" MDM and EDM unconventional interpretation could allow constraining off-diagonal components of the LV tensor if experiments able to measure EDM and MDM components orthogonal to the applied fields are conceived.
