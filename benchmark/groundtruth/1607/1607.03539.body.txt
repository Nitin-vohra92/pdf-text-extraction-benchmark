Magnetic-Field-Induced Topological Reorganization of a P-wave Superconductor

Introduction. Interacting quantum matter constitutes a realm of puzzling phenomena whose understanding promises technological breakthroughs. A striking example is found in the so-called p-wave superconductors (PSCs) in which electrons form Cooper pairs in the symmetric spin-triplet and orbitally-antisymmetric configuration [\cite=SigristUeda]. Substantial experimental investigation has provided evidence for spin-triplet pairing in diverse classes of materials [\cite=Maeno2012] (e.g. heavy fermions [\cite=Stewart1984] [\cite=Saxena2000] [\cite=Kyogaku1993], non-centrosymmetrics [\cite=Bauer2004] [\cite=Nishiyama2007], organics [\cite=Lebed2000] [\cite=Lee2001] [\cite=Shinagawa2007], oxides [\cite=Maeno1998], topological superconductors [\cite=Matano2016], etc.) and in a variety of heterostructures consisting of spin-singlet SCs interfaced with magnetic systems [\cite=Buzdin] [\cite=Efetov] [\cite=Eschrig] [\cite=Linder2015]. One tantalizing perspective of this search is fabricating devices for topological quantum computing based on Majorana fermions (MFs) [\cite=Kitaev2003] [\cite=NayakReview] [\cite=ReadGreen] [\cite=KitaevChain] [\cite=Ivanov] [\cite=AliceaNatPhys] [\cite=Milestones]. The latter correspond to neutral quasiparticle excitations which obey to non-abelian exchange statistics enabling quantum operations by braiding them around one another [\cite=Ivanov] [\cite=NayakReview] [\cite=AliceaNatPhys]. They naturally emerge in one-dimensional (1d) spinless PSCs [\cite=KitaevChain] which constitute the prototypical topological SCs (TSCs). Remarkably, every TSC can be mapped to a PSC in an appropriate limit [\cite=Altland] [\cite=KitaevClassi] [\cite=Ryu], a connection which motivated the proposal of artificial TSCs [\cite=FuKane2008] [\cite=AliceaReview] [\cite=BeenakkerReview] [\cite=FlensbergReview] [\cite=KotetesClassi] and the subsequent observation of MFs in hybrid superconducting devices [\cite=Mourik] [\cite=Deng] [\cite=Furdyna] [\cite=Heiblum] [\cite=Finck] [\cite=Churchill] [\cite=Yazdani] [\cite=Franke] [\cite=Pawlak] [\cite=Albrecht].

While the so far conducted analysis of PSCs has lead to tremendous progress and insight regarding topological systems in general, fundamental aspects of the system itself still remain unexplored. One of the main questions relates to the order parameter (OP) of the PSC, [formula] [\cite=SigristUeda], which constitutes a vector in spin-space and its structure controls the topological behavior of the system. As a spin-vector, the OP is expected to exhibit a rich interplay with an externally applied magnetic field. Despite the immediate experimental significance, PSCs have been considered to be spinless in many cases, a simplification which nevertheless was proven to be an indispensable tool for topological purposes [\cite=KitaevChain]. On the other hand, existing insightful topological studies of spinful PSCs in external magnetic fields have either entirely [\cite=Dumitrescu2013] [\cite=Dumitrescu2014] or partially [\cite=Hyart2014] neglected the energy stability of the various OP configurations, and thus the intrinsic complexity of the spatially resolved self-consistent solutions. In particular, a realistic aspect that has been completely overlooked is the role of boundary effects either locally by directly affecting the occurrence of MFs or globally via their feedback on the bulk or/and topological properties.

In this Letter, we show that the Cooper pair spin-configuration of a 1d PSC with an easy spin-plane and chiral symmetry [\cite=Dumitrescu2014] [\cite=Tewari_and_Sau] [\cite=ChiralTanaka] [\cite=SatoChiral] [\cite=NOZeemanPK] experiences an intricate rearrangement in response to an applied Zeeman field ([formula]), with dramatic consequences on the topological properties. The non-self-consistent topological phase diagram, consisting of phases with N = 1,2 MFs per edge, becomes significantly modified when one naturally allows to the [formula]-vector to reorganize in order to minimize the free energy. We reveal that such internal degree of freedom opens the path to new topological phases with enhanced (N = 3,4) number of MFs per edge. More strikingly, for an open chain we encounter the bulk-boundary correspondence breakdown, since the number of MFs per edge does not coincide with the bulk topological invariant N. This is due to the arising inhomogeneous profile of [formula] near the boundary and the accompanying induced magnetization [formula] [\cite=Hyart2014]. In fact, the system benefits energetically from substantially reorganizing the OP near the boundary to such an extent, that it even affects and reconstructs the OP in the bulk region. When going beyond the easy plane picture, i.e. by assuming [formula], we find that boundary effects can spontaneously violate chiral symmetry. Thus, phases with an even number of MFs per edge become elusive in a realistic situation, further invigorating the unreliability of the bulk-boundary correspondence predictions in correlated topological matter. Model Hamiltonian. The Bogoliubov - de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian for the considered bulk 1d PSC reads

[formula]

where [formula] is expressed using the Nambu spinor [formula] and [formula] ([formula]) are the Pauli matrices acting on the spin (particle-hole) space. The electron dispersion is assumed to have the form εk =  - 2t cos (ka) - 2t' cos (2ka) - 2t'' cos (3ka) - μ, with tν denoting the electron hopping to the ν-th nearest neighbor with lattice constant a, μ is the chemical potential and we set t = 1 and a = 1. In addition, we introduced the Zeeman field [formula] and the odd-parity vectorial OP [formula], with [formula] the earlier mentioned complex vector defining the spin-orientation of the OP. One can also define a matrix OP in spin-space [formula], [formula], defined as [formula]: [formula], [formula] and [formula].

We consider a PSC that is invariant under the D4h point group operations, with main axis along the z direction and a square xy cross-section, as sketched in Fig.[\ref=fig:CartoonSystem]. While we consider that spin-orbit interaction is negligible, we still allow the spin-vectors to transform under the spatial symmetry operations. Concerning the interaction stabilizing the OP, we consider an effective separable four-fermion interaction with anisotropic potentials [formula] and Vz for the spin- xy plane and z axis, respectively. The approach for determining the ground-state (both for closed and open chains) is based on an iterative self-consistent scheme of computation and on the minimization of the total free energy [\cite=Cuoco1] [\cite=Cuoco2]. The analysis is performed for a representative amplitude V and for different sizes L of the chains. Modifying V and L leaves the results qualitatively unchanged. The results shown are for V = 2 and L = 300.

Bulk non-self-consistent topological phase diagram for dz = 0. We start with the bulk case (infinite system or ring geometry) and dz = 0. At zero field the ensuing symmetries allow us to arbitrarily choose the orientation of [formula] in the xy spin-plane. The Hamiltonian can be decomposed into two spin blocks, each of which contributes with 1 MF per edge if |t + t''| > |t' + μ / 2|, as long as the bulk-boundary correspondence applies. Since here we keep the orientation of the [formula]-vector frozen we find that the application of a parallel Zeeman field renders the PSC topologically trivial. In stark contrast, for a perpendicular field the topological regime occurs when [formula] ([formula]) and we retrieve TSC phases with topological invariant N = 1,2. From the above we conclude that as long as the Zeeman field owes a perpendicular component to the [formula]-vector, MFs become accessible. For an arbitrary orientation of the Zeeman field in the yz plane the Hamiltonian resides in the BDI symmetry class and is characterized by chiral, time-reversal and charge-conjugation symmetries [\cite=Altland] [\cite=KitaevClassi] [\cite=Ryu] with corresponding operators: Π  =  τxσx, Θ  =  τzσzK and Ξ  =  τyσyK, with K being the complex conjugation. The topological phase boundaries are determined by the spectrum gap closings at the inversion symmetric k-points kI = 0,π, occuring for |εkI| = h (Fig.  [\ref=fig:PDESP](a)). Thus, the N = 1,2 phases remain accessible.

Bulk self-consistent topological phase diagram for dz = 0. While the results presented in the previous paragraphs are certainly insightful, they cannot capture the actual behavior of a PSC in the presence of the field. The loophole relies on the assumption that the spin-direction of the [formula]-vector is frozen. The latter is against the self-consistent nature of the OP and does not account for its freedom to readjust in order to minimize the free energy. The first general conclusion obtained from the self-consistent analysis is that the [formula]-vector always prefers to be perpendicular to the Zeeman field. Therefore, in the spin-isotropic case Vx = Vy = Vz the system would always reorganize so to ensure [formula]. As discussed earlier, in this case we obtain TSC phases with N = 1,2. However, in the presence of an easy xy spin-plane the situation becomes more intricate since there is an additional energy cost to be paid for achieving [formula], as a result of the spin-anisotropic interaction. Therefore, the configuration [formula] does not necessarily correspond to the ground state of the system and the topological phase diagram is found to be much richer.

For the purpose of highlighting the arising behavior we focus on the extreme anisotropic limit, i.e. Vz = dz = 0. In this case, the [formula]-vector can freely rotate in the xy plane in the absence of the field. When the field is turned on, the [formula] vector will try to maximize the term [formula]. For Vz = 0, implying [formula] and [formula], we find that the dx component is always present since it is perpendicular to the field. The dy component vanishes if hz = 0 (θ  =    ±  π / 2) and is degenerate with dx for hy = 0 (θ = 0,π). For the remaining values of θ, dy is non-zero and becomes sizeable when hz  ≫  hy. The bulk analysis further shows that the field-induced reorganization of the [formula]-vector is strongly dependent on the amplitude of the field. In the weak field regime the [formula]-vector's angle, α, exhibits a pronounced dependence on the field angle θ, and it becomes pinned to α  =  π / 4 above a threshold field corresponding to full spin-polarization.

Remarkably, the simultaneous presence of the two components of the [formula]-vector, apart from modifying the boundaries of the preexisting N = 1,2 TSC phases, can also radically modify the phase diagram by introducing new phases with N > 2 when next-nearest neighbors hopping is included. The origin of such an effect can be attributed to the modified gap closing conditions of the energy spectrum which provide the topological phase boundaries and are given by the coupled equations: ε2k = h2 + 4d2 cos (2α) sin 2k and [formula]. The energy spectrum not only exhibits gap closings at kI, but also for the ±  k* points determined by εk* = hz tan α. Each simultaneous gap closing for a ±  k* pair increases or decreases N by 2, implying that there can be a possibility to obtain phases with N > 2 and additional pairs of MFs per edge protected by chiral symmetry [\cite=Altland] [\cite=KitaevClassi] [\cite=Ryu] [\cite=Dumitrescu2014] [\cite=Tewari_and_Sau] [\cite=ChiralTanaka] [\cite=SatoChiral] [\cite=NOZeemanPK].

For the given k-structure of the pairing terms and εk, we find N = 3,4 (see Fig. [\ref=fig:PDESP](b)), which as long as bulk-boundary correspondence is intact would imply the appearance of 3 and 4MFs per edge. In fact, the phase with 3(4) MFs per edge can be accessed from a 1(2) MF phase and can be captured only within the self-consistent approach allowing for the two components of the [formula]-vector. Here the phases with N = 3,4 occur in a small region of the parameter space for the p-wave OPs, implying that such a scenario may not be easily accessible in these materials. Nonetheless, such a mechanism of MF induction without altering the symmetry class is quite generic and can be pursued in alternative topological systems.

Boundary effects on the topological phase diagram for dz = 0. While one would expect that, according to the bulk-boundary correspondence, the self-consistently performed bulk analysis of the topological invariant N would provide the number of MFs appearing per edge, such a connection becomes invalid here. As a matter of fact, cases of bulk-boundary correspondence breakdown become manifest when we determine the ground-state by performing a self-consistent analysis using open, instead of periodic, boundary conditions. For weak applied fields we obtain a first order transition resulting to a rotation of the [formula] vector, due to an emergent competition between boundary and bulk contributions in the free energy. We find that bulk-boundary correspondence becomes systematically inapplicable due to a reorientation of the [formula]-vector all over the system, which allows to the dy component to become dominant over the dx for θ close to 0 and π. This result corrects the bulk self-consistent approach and renders, in any realistic situation, part of the previously considered topological regime as trivial. The resulting topological phase diagram as a function of the amplitude of the applied field and the electron density is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:PDESP](c), for a fixed representative orientation of the field. The increase of the Zeeman field drives a reorientation of the [formula]-vector via a first order dy  →  dx transition (Figs. [\ref=fig:PDESP](d),(e)) concerning the dominant [formula]-vector component. Such transition depends on the strength of the Zeeman field and vanishes above a threshold which for the parameters assumed is h  ~  0.8. The region of the phase diagram with |dx|  ≫  |dy| is topologically non-trivial and supports 2MFs per edge.

By investigating in detail the evolution of the free energy for the two solutions, we observe that the stability of the configuration with a dominant dy stems from the lowering of the free energy via the OP reconstruction near the edge. As mentioned earlier, for a ring geometry there exists a degeneracy of dx,y for θ = 0, while for [formula] the dy component is disfavored. Hence, as depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:PDESP](f), the energy exhibits a monotonic behavior as θ varies in

. In contrast, by retrieving the free energy in the presence of the boundary, we find that it develops minima with |dy|  ≫  |dx| for θ close to 0 and π. We have also investigated the spatial profile of the [formula]-vector and verified that there is a substantial increase of the dy component near the edge. Such a boundary OP reorganization appears capable of modifying the properties of the entire SC and conclude with a topological transition without any gap closing. The above mentioned transition can be alternatively viewed as a result of the interplay between the magnetization near the boundary and the spin-triplet OP. The emergent spin-activity of the boundary can relate to [formula]-vector reconstruction phenomena encountered in ferromagnet-PSC hybrids, which are understood on the basis of spin-filtered Andreev reflection [\cite=Gentile2013].

Self-consistent topological phase diagram for [formula]. As mentioned earlier, if Vx = Vy = Vz the [formula]-vector will always reorient so that [formula], yielding N = 1,2. In the case of an easy axis, Vz  ≫  Vx,y, the direction of the [formula]-vector is essentially frozen and our non-self-consistent analysis applies: when the field is parallel to the z axis the system is a topologically-trivial PSC, while when a field-component perpendicular to the [formula]-vector appears MFs become in principle accessible. Thus only the case Vz  ≪  V remains to be explored. In the latter, the dz OP is expected to be small and as long as the orientation of the field is constrained within the yz plane, the appearance of dz is mainly controlled by the following magnetic contribution ihy(d*zdx - dzd*x) to the free energy [\cite=Hyart2014], which sources a non-zero bulk magnetization My. Therefore, [formula]. The presence of a bulk dz component with the given phase locking respects the preexesting chiral symmetry of the system, since the corresponding Hamiltonian term reads 2dz sin kτxσz ([formula]). Therefore the TSC phases N = 1,2 are still accessible.

While the above picture is indeed confirmed by our self-consistent calculations when imposing periodic boundary conditions, severe discrepancies emerge in the presence of boundaries related to the spontaneous appearance of an [formula] magnetization component. The latter becomes non-zero solely near the boundary since only there the [formula]-vector becomes complex, while in the bulk dy and dz are both real implying Mx = 0. The spatial profiles of [formula] and [formula] for an open chain are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:3]. The complex character of the dy,z components near the boundary leads to the respective spontaneous violation of chiral symmetry. Thus we arrive to another encounter of bulk-boundary correspondence violation, since phases with N = 2 which would imply 2MFs per edge, now become unobservable as each MF pair hybridizes into finite energy bound states.

Conclusions. As we showed above, spin-triplet superconductors in a Zeeman field actually exhibit topological scenarios which are completely unexpected within a non-self-consistent framework and crucially depend on the order parameter's spin-structure and spatial-profile. Our self-consistent analysis revealed that such materials exhibit topological shielding, i.e. the increase of the topological invariant in order to minimize the system's free energy. Moreover, the substantial boundary reconstruction of the order parameter can also drastically affect the appearance of Majorana fermions. The latter either occurs due to the spontaneous violation of a particular bulk symmetry near the boundary or the radical reconstruction of the bulk ground state when the boundary contribution to the free energy becomes significant. These interaction-driven manifestations of bulk-boundary correspondence breakdown open perspectives for driving a topological phase transition without any bulk spectrum gap closing but rather via solely controlling the physical properties at the edge.
