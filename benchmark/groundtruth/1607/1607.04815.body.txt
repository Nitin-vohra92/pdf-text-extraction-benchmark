Infinite families of t-designs from a type of five-weight codes

Introduction

We start with a brief recall of t-designs. Let P be a set of v  ≥  1 elements, and let B be a set of k-subsets of P, where k is a positive integer with 1  ≤  k  ≤  v. Let t be a positive integer with t  ≤  k. The pair [formula] is called a t-(v,k,λ) design, or simply t-design, if every t-subset of P is contained in exactly λ elements of B. The elements of P are called points, and those of B are referred to as blocks. We usually use b to denote the number of blocks in B. A t-design is called simple if B does not contain repeated blocks. In this paper, we consider only simple t-designs. A t-design is called symmetric if v  =  b. It is clear that t-designs with k  =  t or k  =  v always exist. Such t-designs are trivial. In this paper, we consider only t-designs with v  >  k  >  t. A t-(v,k,λ) design is referred to as a Steiner system if t  ≥  2 and λ = 1, and is denoted by S(t,k,v).

A necessary condition for the existence of a t-(v,k,λ) design is that

[formula]

for all integer i with 0  ≤  i  ≤  t.

The interplay between codes and t-designs goes in two directions. In one direction, the incidence matrix of any t-design generates a linear code over any finite field [formula]. A lot of progress in this direction has been made and documented in the literature (see, for examples, [\cite=AK92], [\cite=DingBook], [\cite=Tonchev] [\cite=Tonchevhb]). In the other direction, the codewords of a fixed Hamming weight in a linear or nonlinear code may hold a t-design. Some linear and nonlinear codes were employed to construct t-designs [\cite=AK92] [\cite=HKM04] [\cite=HMT05] [\cite=KM00] [\cite=MT04] [\cite=Tonchev] [\cite=Tonchevhb]. Binary and ternary Golay codes of certain parameters give 4-designs and 5-designs. However, the largest t for which an infinite family of t-designs is derived directly from codes is t = 3. According to the references [\cite=AK92], [\cite=Tonchev] [\cite=Tonchevhb] and [\cite=KLhb], not much progress on the construction of t-designs from codes has been made so far, while many other constructions of t-designs are documented in the literature ([\cite=BJL] [\cite=CMhb] [\cite=KLhb] [\cite=RR10]).

The objective of this paper is to construct infinite families of 2-designs and 3-designs from a type of binary linear codes with five weights. The obtained t-designs depend only on the weight distribution of the underlying binary codes. The total number of 2-designs and 3-designs presented in this paper are exponential in m, where m  ≥  5 is an odd integer. In addition, the block size of the designs can vary in a huge range.

The classical construction of t-designs from codes

Let C be a

[formula]

code. Suppose [formula] has minimum weight [formula]. Suppose that Ai = Ai(C) and [formula], for 0  ≤  i  ≤  v, are the weight distributions of C and [formula], respectively. Fix a positive integer t with t  <  d, and let s be the number of i with [formula] for 0  <  i  ≤  v - t. Suppose that s  ≤  d - t. Then

the codewords of weight i in C hold a t-design provided that Ai  ≠  0 and d  ≤  i  ≤  v, and

the codewords of weight i in [formula] hold a t-design provided that [formula] and [formula].

To construct t-designs via Theorem [\ref=thm-AM1], we will need the following lemma in subsequent sections, which is a variant of the MacWilliam Identity [\cite=vanLint].

Let C be a

[formula]

A(z)=q1+(q-1)zA.

[formula]

Later in this paper, we will need also the following theorem.

Let C be an

[formula]

, where [formula] denotes the minimum distance of [formula].

[formula] has parameters

[formula]

, where [formula] denotes the minimum distance of [formula]. Furthermore, [formula] has only even-weight codewords, and all the nonzero weights in [formula] are the following:

[formula]

where [formula] denote all the nonzero weights of C.

The conclusions of the first two parts are straightforward. We prove only the conclusions of the third part below.

Since [formula] has length n + 1 and dimension n - k, the dimension of [formula] is k + 1. By assumption, all codes under consideration are binary. By definition, [formula] has only even-weight codewords. Recall that [formula] is the extended code of [formula]. It is known that the generator matrix of [formula] is given by ([\cite=HP03])

[formula]

where [formula] is the all-one vector of length n, [formula], which is a column vector of length n, and G is the generator matrix of C. Notice again that [formula] is binary, the desired conclusions on the weights in [formula] follow from the relation between the two generator matrices of the two codes [formula] and C.

A type of binary linear codes with five-weights and related codes

In this section, we first introduce a type of binary linear codes Cm of length n = 2m - 1, which has the weight distribution of Table [\ref=tab-zhou3], and then analyze their dual codes [formula], the extended codes [formula], and the duals [formula]. Such codes will be employed to construct t-designs in Sections [\ref=sec-2designs] and [\ref=sec-3designs]. Examples of such codes will be given in Section [\ref=sec-examplecodes].

Let m  ≥  5 be an odd integer and let Cm be a binary code with the weight distribution of Table [\ref=tab-zhou3]. Then the dual code [formula] has parameters

[formula]

By assumption, the weight enumerator of Cm is given by

[formula]

It then follows from Theorem [\ref=thm-MI] that the weight enumerator of [formula] is given by

[formula]

Hence, we have

[formula]

Obviously, we have

[formula]

It is easily seen that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Similarly,

[formula]

and

[formula]

Finally, we have

[formula]

Combining these formulas above yields the weight distribution formula for [formula].

The weight distribution in Table [\ref=tab-zhou3] tells us that the dimension of Cm is 3m. Therefore, the dimension of [formula] is equal to 2m - 1 - 3m. Finally, we prove that the minimum distance of [formula] equals 7.

We now prove that [formula] for all k with 1  ≤  k  ≤  6. Let x = 2(m - 1) / 2. With the weight distribution formula obtained before, we have

[formula]

Consequently,

[formula]

Plugging k = 2 into the weight distribution formula above, we get that

[formula]

Consequently,

[formula]

After similar computations with the weight distribution formula, one can prove that [formula] for all k with 3  ≤  k  ≤  6.

Plugging k = 7 into the weight distribution formula above, we arrive at

[formula]

Notice that x4  -  5x2  +  34 = (x2 - 5 / 2)2 + 34 - 25 / 4 > 0. We have [formula] for all odd m  ≥  5. This proves the desired conclusion on the minimum distance of [formula].

Let m  ≥  5 be an odd integer and let Cm be a binary code with the weight distribution of Table [\ref=tab-zhou3]. The code [formula] has parameters

[formula]

and its weight enumerator is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

It follows from Theorem [\ref=thm-allcodes] that the code has all the weights given in ([\ref=eqn-doubledual]). It remains to determine the frequencies of these weights. The weight distribution of the code Cm given in Table [\ref=tab-zhou3] and the generator matrix of the code [formula] documented in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-allcodes] show that

[formula]

where c was defined in Theorem [\ref=thm-BCHcodeDual].

We now determine u and v. Recall that [formula] has minimum distance 7. It then follows from Theorem [\ref=thm-allcodes] that [formula] has minimum distance 8. The first and third Pless power moments say that

[formula]

These two equations become

[formula]

Solving this system of equations proves the desired conclusion on the weight enumerator of this code.

Finally, we settle the weight distribution of the code [formula].

Let m  ≥  5 be an odd integer and let Cm be a binary code with the weight distribution of Table [\ref=tab-zhou3]. The code [formula] has parameters

[formula]

By definition,

[formula]

It has been showed in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-BCHcodeDual] that the minimum distance of [formula] is equal to 8. We now prove the conclusion on the weight distribution of this code.

By Theorems [\ref=thm-MI] and [\ref=thm-lastcode], the weight enumerator of [formula] is given by

[formula]

Consequently, we have

[formula]

We now treat the terms in ([\ref=eqn-j18-1]) one by one. We first have

[formula]

One can easily see that

[formula]

Notice that

[formula]

and

[formula]

We have then

[formula]

Similarly, we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Plugging ([\ref=eqn-j18-2]), ([\ref=eqn-j18-3]), ([\ref=eqn-j18-4]), ([\ref=eqn-j18-5]), ([\ref=eqn-j18-6]), and ([\ref=eqn-j18-7]) into ([\ref=eqn-j18-1]) proves the desired conclusion.

Infinite families of 2-designs from [formula] and Cm

Let m  ≥  5 be an odd integer and let Cm be a binary code with the weight distribution of Table [\ref=tab-zhou3]. Let [formula], and let B be the set of the supports of the codewords of Cm with weight k, where Ak  ≠  0. Then (P,B) is a 2-(2m - 1,k,λ) design, where

[formula]

where Ak is given in Table [\ref=tab-zhou3].

Let [formula], and let [formula] be the set of the supports of the codewords of [formula] with weight k and [formula]. Then [formula] is a 2-(2m - 1,k,λ) design, where

[formula]

where [formula] is given in Theorem [\ref=thm-BCHcodeDual].

The weight distribution of [formula] is given in Theorem [\ref=thm-BCHcodeDual] and that of Cm is given in Table [\ref=tab-zhou3]. By Theorem [\ref=thm-BCHcodeDual], the minimum distance [formula] of [formula] is equal to 7. Put t = 2. The number of i with Ai  ≠  0 and 1  ≤  i  ≤  2m - 1 - t is s = 5. Hence, [formula]. The desired conclusions then follow from Theorem [\ref=thm-AM1] and the fact that two binary vectors have the same support if and only if they are equal.

Let m  ≥  5 be an odd integer and let Cm be a binary code with the weight distribution of Table [\ref=tab-zhou3]. Then the BCH code Cm holds five 2-designs with the following parameters:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Let m  ≥  5 be an odd integer and let Cm be a binary code with the weight distribution of Table [\ref=tab-zhou3]. Then the supports of all codewords of weight 7 in [formula] give a 2-(2m - 1,7,λ) design, where

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=thm-BCHcodeDual], we have

[formula]

The desired conclusion on λ follows from Theorem [\ref=thm-2designs].

Let m  ≥  5 be an odd integer and let Cm be a binary code with the weight distribution of Table [\ref=tab-zhou3]. Then the supports of all codewords of weight 8 in [formula] give a 2-(2m - 1,8,λ) design, where

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=thm-BCHcodeDual], we have

[formula]

The desired conclusion on λ follows from Theorem [\ref=thm-2designs].

Let m  ≥  7 be an odd integer and let Cm be a binary code with the weight distribution of Table [\ref=tab-zhou3]. Then the supports of all codewords of weight 9 in [formula] give a 2-(2m - 1,9,λ) design, where

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=thm-BCHcodeDual], we have

[formula]

The desired conclusion on λ follows from Theorem [\ref=thm-2designs].

Infinite families of 3-designs from [formula] and [formula]

Let m  ≥  5 be an odd integer and let Cm be a binary code with the weight distribution of Table [\ref=tab-zhou3]. Let [formula], and let [formula] be the set of the supports of the codewords of [formula] with weight k, where [formula]. Then [formula] is a 3-(2m,k,λ) design, where

[formula]

where [formula] is given in Theorem [\ref=thm-lastcode].

Let [formula], and let [formula] be the set of the supports of the codewords of [formula] with weight k and [formula]. Then [formula] is a 3-(2m,k,λ) design, where

[formula]

where [formula] is given in Theorem [\ref=thm-3rdcode].

The weight distributions of [formula] and [formula] are described in Theorems [\ref=thm-lastcode] and [\ref=thm-3rdcode]. Notice that the minimum distance [formula] of [formula] is equal to 8. Put t = 3. The number of i with [formula] and 1  ≤  i  ≤  2m - t is s = 5. Hence, [formula]. Clearly, two binary vectors have the same support if and only if they are equal. The desired conclusions then follow from Theorem [\ref=thm-AM1].

Let m  ≥  5 be an odd integer and let Cm be a binary code with the weight distribution of Table [\ref=tab-zhou3]. Then [formula] holds five 3-designs with the following parameters:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Let m  ≥  5 be an odd integer and let Cm be a binary code with the weight distribution of Table [\ref=tab-zhou3]. Then the supports of all codewords of weight 8 in [formula] give a 3-(2m,8,λ) design, where

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=thm-3rdcode], we have

[formula]

The desired value of λ follows from Theorem [\ref=thm-newdesigns2].

Let m  ≥  7 be an odd integer and let Cm be a binary code with the weight distribution of Table [\ref=tab-zhou3]. Then the supports of all codewords of weight 10 in [formula] give a 3-(2m,10,λ) design, where

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=thm-3rdcode], we have

[formula]

The desired value of λ follows from Theorem [\ref=thm-newdesigns2].

Let m  ≥  5 be an odd integer and let Cm be a binary code with the weight distribution of Table [\ref=tab-zhou3]. Then the supports of all codewords of weight 12 in [formula] give a 3-(2m,12,λ) design, where

[formula]

and h = m - 1.

By Theorem [\ref=thm-3rdcode], we have

[formula]

where ε = 2(m - 1) / 2. The desired value of λ follows from Theorem [\ref=thm-newdesigns2].

Two families of binary cyclic codes with the weight distribution of Table [\ref=tab-zhou3]

To prove the existence of the 2-designs in Section [\ref=sec-2designs] and the 3-designs in Section [\ref=sec-3designs], we present two families of binary codes of length 2m - 1 with the weight distribution of Table [\ref=tab-zhou3].

Let n = qm - 1, where m is a positive integer. Let α be a generator of [formula]. For any i with 0  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1, let [formula] denote the minimal polynomial of βi over [formula]. For any 2  ≤  δ  ≤  n, define

[formula]

where b is an integer, [formula] denotes the least common multiple of these minimal polynomials, and the addition in the subscript b + i of [formula] always means the integer addition modulo n. Let C(q,n,δ,b) denote the cyclic code of length n with generator polynomial g(q,n,δ,b)(x). C(q,n,δ,b) is called a primitive BCH code with designed distance δ. When b = 1, the set C(q,n,δ,b) is called a narrow-sense primitive BCH code.

Although primitive BCH codes are not good asymptotically, they are among the best linear codes when the length of the codes is not very large [\cite=DingBook]. So far, we have very limited knowledge of BCH codes, as the dimension and minimum distance of BCH codes are in general open, in spite of some recent progress [\cite=Ding] [\cite=DDZ15]. However, in a few cases the weight distribution of a BCH code can be settled. The following theorem introduces such a case.

Let m  ≥  5 be an odd integer and let δ = 2m - 1 - 1 - 2(m + 1) / 2. Then the BCH code C(2,2m - 1,δ,0) has length n = 2m - 1, dimension 3m, and the weight distribution in Table [\ref=tab-zhou3].

A proof can be found in [\cite=DFZ].

It is known that the dual of a BCH code may not be a BCH code. The following theorem describes a family of cyclic codes having the weight distribution of Table [\ref=tab-zhou3], which may not be BCH codes.

Let m  ≥  5 be an odd integer. Let Cm be the dual of the narrow-sense primitive BCH code C(2,2m - 1,7,1). Then Cm has the weight distribution of Table [\ref=tab-zhou3].

A proof can be found in [\cite=Kasa69].

Summary and concluding remarks

In this paper, with any binary linear code of length 2m - 1 and the weight distribution of Table [\ref=tab-zhou3], a huge number of infinite families of 2-designs and 3-designs with various block sizes were constructed. These constructions clearly show that the coding theory approach to constructing t-designs are in fact promising, and may stimulate further investigations in this direction. It is open if the codewords of a fixed weight in a family of linear codes can hold an infinite family of t-designs for some t  ≥  4.

It is noticed that the technical details of this paper are tedious. However, one has to settle the weight distribution of a linear code and the minimum distance of its dual at the same time, if one would like to employ the Assmus-Mattson Theorem for the construction of t-designs. Note that it could be very difficult to prove that a linear code has minimum weight 7. This explains why the proofs of some of the theorems are messy and tedious, but necessary.
