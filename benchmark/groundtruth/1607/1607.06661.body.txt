Considerable progress in the theory of Darboux-Moutard type transforms for two-dimensional linear differential systems with applications to geometry, spectral theory, and soliton equations has been achieved recently, see, e.g., [\cite=L] [\cite=TT] [\cite=T] [\cite=GN]. In the present note we derive such a transformation for the matrix generalized function system

[formula]

where [formula], the coefficients A and B and solutions Ψ are (N  ×  N)-matrix functions on D, with D an open simply connected domain in [formula]. In particular, this generalizes the transform for N = 1 found in [\cite=GN] with A = 0. In addition, we show that the Moutard type transform for system ([\ref=1]) with B = 0 is equivalent to a gauge transform for the connection [formula]. In turn, our studies show that the Moutard type transform for system ([\ref=1]) with A = 0 can be treated as a proper analog of the forementioned gauge transform.

As for N = 1, system ([\ref=1]) is reduced to the system

[formula]

i.e. to system ([\ref=1]) with A = 0, by the gauge transform

[formula]

We say that the system

[formula]

is conjugate to system ([\ref=2]) (see [\cite=V] for a similar definition for N = 1).

We have the following result.

Systems ([\ref=2]) and ([\ref=3]) are covariant, i.e. mapped into the systems of the same type, with respect to the Moutard type transform

[formula]

where F and F+ are arbitrary fixed solutions of ([\ref=2]) and ([\ref=3]), respectively,

[formula]

for Φ and Φ+ meeting equations ([\ref=2]) and ([\ref=3]), and det   ωF,F+  ≠  0.

For finding ωΦ,Φ+ satisfying ([\ref=5]) we use also that ∂zωΦ,Φ+  =    -  +Φ. In addition, our definition of ωΦ,Φ+ is self-consistent up to a pure imaginary matrix integration constant in view of the identity [formula]. The latter equality follows from systems ([\ref=2]) and ([\ref=3]) for Φ and Φ+, respectively. We recall that the domain D is simply connected.

Given ωF,F+,ωΨ,F+, and ωF,Ψ+, Theorem [\ref=t1] is proved by straightforward computations.

In addition, for the system

[formula]

i.e., for system ([\ref=1]) with B = 0, the following result also holds.

System ([\ref=6]) is covariant under the following Moutard type transform

[formula]

where F is an arbitrary fixed solution of ([\ref=6]), F+ is an arbitrary fixed matrix function,

[formula]

for any matrix function Φ, and det   F,F+  ≠  0.

Equations ([\ref=7]) and ([\ref=8]) are analogs of equations ([\ref=4]) and ([\ref=5]). However, in difference with ([\ref=5]), we do not require that the matrix functions F,F+ would be pure imaginary. Equation ([\ref=8]) is solvable for F,F+ and Proposition 1 is proved by straightforward computations.

Remark. Let A,Ã,Ψ,F,F+, and Φ,F+ be the same as in Proposition 1. Let

[formula]

Then

[formula]

It is proved by straightforward computations and it shows that for invertible g the transform A  →  Ã reduces to a gauge transform.
