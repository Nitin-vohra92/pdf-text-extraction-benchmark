The chromatic number of the square of the 8-cube

Introduction

A cube-like graph is a Cayley graph for the elementary abelian group of order 2n. One of the original motivations for studying cube-like graphs was the fact that they have only integer eigenvalues [\cite=H75]. Cube-like graphs also form a generalization of the hypercube.

There has been a lot of interest in the chromatic number of cube-like graphs [\cite=JT95]. In the early studies, people realized that many types of such graphs have a chromatic number that is a power of two [\cite=DHLL90]. This observation inspired work into one of the two main research directions that have emerged: Determine the spectrum of chromatic numbers of cube-like graphs. Payan [\cite=P92] showed that there are gaps in the spectrum by proving that 3 is not a possible chromatic number; he also found a cube-like graph with chromatic number 7, disproving earlier conjectures that the chromatic number might always be a power of two.

The other main research direction is that of determining the chromatic number for specific families of cube-like graphs. The n-dimensional hypercube, also called the n-cube and denoted by Qn, is the graph with one vertex for each binary word of length n and with an edge between two vertices exactly when the Hamming distance between the corresponding words is 1. The kth power of a graph Γ  =  (V,E) is the graph Γk  =  (V',E'), where V' = V and in which two vertices are adjacent exactly when their distance in Γ is at most k. In the current work, we focus on the chromatic number of (the cube-like graph) Qkn, denoted by χk̄(n). The chromatic number χk̄(n) has been studied, for example, in [\cite=KDP00] [\cite=Z01] [\cite=NDG02] [\cite=O04] and is further motivated by the problem of scalability of certain optical networks [\cite=W97].

The value of [formula] has been determined for n  ≤  7, and for n  =  8 it has been known that [formula], where the upper bound follows from 14-colorings found independently by Hougardy [\cite=Z01] and Royle [\cite=JT95]. By finding a 13-coloring of Q28, we shall here prove that [formula]. The result is obtained by computer search, where the search space is reduced by prescribing symmetries. An exhaustive classification is further carried out in the reduced search space. We also show that none of the colorings of Q28 that were found can occur as a subgraph in a 13-coloring of Q29.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section [\ref=sec:definitions], we review the relation between binary codes and the graph Qkn, give definitions, and survey some old results. Properties of a putative 13-coloring of Q28 that are utilized in the computer search are discussed in Section [\ref=sec:8cube]. The method for computational classification is explained in Section [\ref=sec:algorithm], the results are reported in Section [\ref=sec:results], and a consistency check of the computational results is discussed in Section [\ref=sec:doublecount]. Finally, Section [\ref=sec:extend] describes a method for searching for 13-colorings of Q29 starting from the available 13-colorings of Q28.

Binary codes and powers of the n-cube

We have seen that the graphs Qn and Qkn are conveniently defined via the corresponding Hamming space. Similarly, the problem of studying the chromatic number of these graphs benefits from a coding-theoretic framework.

A binary code of length n and size M is a subset of [formula] of size M. Since all codes in this work are binary, we frequently omit that term and just talk about codes. The elements of a code are called codewords, and the minimum distance of a code is the smallest Hamming distance between any two distinct codewords. A binary code with length n, size M, and minimum distance at least d is called an (n,M,d) code. A binary code is called even if the Hamming weight of all codewords is even. We denote the set of all even-weight binary words of length n by [formula] and the set of all odd-weight binary words of length n by [formula]. Determining A(n,d), the largest possible size of a code with given n and d, is one of the main problems in combinatorial coding theory.

A proper coloring of Qkn corresponds to a partition of [formula] into binary codes with minimum distance at least k + 1. The maximum size of a color class is A(n,k + 1), which implies the lower bound

[formula]

For colorings of Q2n, general constructions [\cite=W97] [\cite=LMT88] give

[formula]

When n = 2t - j where j = 1,2,3,4, we have A(n,3) = 22t - t - j because the j - 1 times shortened Hamming code is optimal [\cite=BB77], so [\eqref=eq:lower] and [\eqref=eq:upper] coincide. With n  ≤  15, [formula] is unknown for n = 8,9,10,11. For these values of n, the values of A(n,3) are 20, 40, 72, and 144, respectively [\cite=BBMOS78] [\cite=B80] [\cite=OBK99], and [\eqref=eq:lower] yields the lower bounds 13, 13, 15, and 15, respectively. The upper bound [formula] follows from 14-colorings of Q28 found independently by Hougardy in 1991 [\cite=Z01] and Royle in 1993 [\cite=JT95]. In this work, we shall show that [formula]. Recently, Lauri [\cite=L16] reported a 14-coloring of Q29, which implies that [formula].

The concept of symmetry is essential for the results of the current study. Two binary codes are called equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a permutation of coordinates and addition of a word in [formula] to each codeword. The operations maintaining equivalence of binary codes are the isometries of the Hamming space [formula]. For even-weight binary codes of length n, we require that the addition be carried out with even-weight words and denote the group of operations maintaining equivalence by Gn.

The halved n-cube, [formula], is the graph over the words of [formula] that has edges between any two vertices whose Hamming distance is 2. It is well known that Q2n is isomorphic to [formula]: adding a parity bit to each word in [formula] gives an isomorphism. For n  ≥  4, the automorphism group of [formula] has order (n + 1)!2n. The automorphisms are precisely the operations maintaining equivalence of even binary codes. Further, an independent set in [formula] corresponds to an even binary code of length n + 1 with minimum distance at least 4. Therefore, it is convenient to use even binary codes of length n + 1 when discussing colorings of the square of the n-cube. A proper coloring of Q2n thus corresponds to a partition of [formula] into even binary codes of minimum distance at least 4. We call partitions of [formula] and partitions of a subset of [formula] that contain only codes with minimum distance at least 4 admissible.

For an element g∈Gn and a codeword [formula], we use the notation gc for g acting on c. Further, for a code [formula], we denote gC  =  {gc:c∈C}, and for a set of codes [formula] we denote gC  =  {gC:C∈C}. Two codes, C and D, are equivalent if C = gD for some g∈Gn. The automorphism group of a code C is the group [formula]. The orbit of a code [formula] under a group H  ≤  Gn is the set {hC:h∈H}. We call two partitions C and C' of [formula] isomorphic if gC  =  C' for some g∈Gn. The automorphism group of a partition C is the group [formula]}.

The Hamming code of length 7 and size 16 is the unique (7,16,3) code (up to equivalence) code that is a subspace of the vector space [formula]. The extended Hamming code is the even (8,16,4) code obtained by adding a parity bit to each codeword of the Hamming code. Adding another parity bit to each codeword (0 for all codewords) gives the doubly extended Hamming code, which is an even (9,16,4) code.

Partitions of [formula]

As discussed above, a proper coloring of the square of the 8-cube, Q28, corresponds to a partition of [formula] into even codes with minimum distance at least 4. Let us now consider the distribution of code sizes in such a partition containing 13 codes. As the maximum size of a code is A(8,3) = A(9,4) = 20, there are five different distributions:

one code of size 16, twelve of size 20,

one code of size 17, one of size 19, eleven of size 20,

two codes of size 18, eleven of size 20,

one code of size 18, two of size 19, ten of size 20,

four codes of size 19, nine of size 20.

All attempts by the authors to exhaustively search for partitions of these types failed, like in (unpublished) earlier studies. See also [\cite=R08]. The authors then decided to restrict the search to partitions with prescribed automorphism groups, which turned out to be successful as we shall see.

Specifically, we search for, and classify up to isomorphism, all admissible partitions C of [formula] for which [formula]. The case when one code is the doubly extended Hamming code of size 16 leads to many admissible partitions, and this case is also considered for [formula].

We shall next prove some results that provide the theoretical framework for our search. Prescribing automorphism groups in the construction of combinatorial objects is a standard technique [\cite=KO06], but there are a few more details to take into account when considering sets of objects rather than single objects. For example, an automorphism of such a set may map an object (here, code) onto itself or onto another object.

Theorem [\ref=thm:subgroup] below shows that for the problem at hand, all admissible partitions can be found by first fixing a code C and a subgroup [formula] and then searching for all admissible partitions C for which C∈C and [formula].

Let C be a partition of [formula] that contains N codes of size M. Let [formula] such that |H| is a power of a prime p. If |H| and N are coprime, then [formula] for a code C of size M.

Because hC∈C for each C∈C and h∈H, the set of codes of size M is partitioned into orbits by H. The size of every orbit must divide |H|. Because p does not divide N, at least one orbit has length 1. Thus H is a group of automorphisms of the single code in that orbit.

Let C be a partition of [formula] into 13 codes of minimum distance at least 4.

If C contains the doubly extended Hamming code C and [formula], then there is a subgroup [formula] of prime order which is also a subgroup of [formula].

If [formula], then there is a subgroup [formula] whose order is 4 or an odd prime so that [formula] for some code C∈C.

Because [formula] is nontrivial, it necessarily contains a subgroup H of prime order. Because C is the only code of size 16 in the partition, [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem:coprime].

The group [formula] has a subgroup H of order 4 or of order p where p is an odd prime. We have the following cases based on the size distribution of C. We use Lemma [\ref=lem:coprime] in all cases.

[formula]: [formula] where |C| = 16.

[formula]: [formula] where |C| = 17.

[formula]: Because H is a subgroup of Gn, |H| divides |Gn| = 9!28. Therefore |H| and 11 are coprime, so there is a code C of size 20 such that [formula].

[formula]: [formula] where |C| = 18.

4  ×  19  +  9  ×  20: We get two cases:

|H| = 4: Because 9 and |H| are coprime, [formula] where |C| = 20.

|H| is an odd prime p: Because 4 and |H| are coprime, [formula] where |C| = 19.

Using more precise language, every partition C that we wish to find occurs in a triple (C,C,H) for which C∈C, [formula] and [formula] where the sizes of C and H are as in one of the cases in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:subgroup].

Because we are eventually interested only in constructing nonisomorphic partitions C, we can reduce the search space by the following observations. Theorem [\ref=thm:1] shows that it is enough to consider one candidate C from each equivalence class. Theorem [\ref=thm:2] shows that for a given code C, it is enough to consider only one subgroup from each conjugacy class of subgroups of [formula].

Let C be a partition of [formula], let C be a code in C, and let H be a group for which [formula] and [formula]. Let D be a code equivalent to C. Then C is isomorphic to a partition D for which D∈D and [formula] and [formula] where H' is a conjugate of H in Gn.

Let g be an isomorphism for which D  =  gC. Let D  =  gC. Now D is a partition isomorphic to C and contains D. Finally, for each h∈H, we have ghg- 1D  =  ghC  =  gC  =  D and ghg- 1D  =  ghC  =  gC  =  D, so H' = gHg- 1 has the required properties.

Let C be a partition of [formula], let C be a code in C, and let H be a group for which [formula] and [formula]. Let H' be a conjugate of H in [formula]. Then C is isomorphic to a partition D for which C∈D, [formula], and [formula].

Let [formula] such that H' = gHg- 1. Let D  =  gC. Now C  =  gC∈D, and, for each h∈H, we have ghg- 1D  =  ghC  =  gC  =  D, so [formula]. Therefore D  =  gC satisfies the conditions.

Computational classification

Algorithm

Before the main search, the authors classified the even (9,M,4) codes for 16  ≤  M  ≤  20; the number of equivalence classes is 343566, 41499, 2041, 33, and 2, respectively. This classification was carried out and validated with software developed for [\cite=O11]; some of these codes were classified already in [\cite=OBK99]. The automorphism groups of the codes can be obtained as a by-product of this classification or by separately using a standard transformation to a colored graph [\cite=OBK99] (see also [\cite=KO06]) which is fed to the graph isomorphism software nauty [\cite=MP14]. We use the notation CM for a set of representatives of the equivalence classes of even (9,M,4) codes.

The main idea of the search algorithm is to start by fixing a code C in the partition and a group H that is a subgroup of the automorphism groups of C and the partition. The other codes in the partition are divided into orbits by H, so the search proceeds by finding possible orbits and combining them into partitions of [formula].

The search algorithm is given as Algorithm [\ref=alg:search] in pseudocode. The search is carried out by calling [formula] for each of the six possible cases regarding size distributions of codes and choice of the code size |C| particularized in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:subgroup]. The parameters of the call are as follows. The value of M is the size of the particularized code C in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:subgroup]. Disregarding C, there are one or two sizes for the remaining codes. Let N1 be the number of codes of size M1 and N2 the number of codes of size M2, where 0  ≤  N1  ≤  N2 (so N1 = 0 if there is only one size of remaining codes; then M1 is undefined) and N1  +  N2  =  12.

The following subroutines are called from the search algorithm. We use the notation P(X), where X is a set, for the set of all subsets of X.

[formula], where X is a set, S  ⊆  P(P(X)), and N is an integer: Finds all subsets S of S where each element of X appears at most once and [formula], and returns the set of all such sets S.

[formula], where X is a set and S  ⊆  P(P(Y)) for some Y  ⊇  X: Finds all subsets S of [formula] so that each element of X appears exactly once in S, and returns the set of all such sets S.

[formula] returns a set containing one representative from each conjugacy class of subgroups of G of order 4 or odd prime (2 or odd prime when C is the doubly extended Hamming code).

The first routine essentially finds cliques in a graph with vertices for sets of words and edges whenever the corresponding sets are nonintersecting. In this work a tailored backtrack algorithm was used due to the large number of vertices in the corresponding graph. For the last two routines, one may use the libexact software [\cite=KP08] and any computer algebra software (actually, the groups are so small that even brute force search performs well), respectively.

Let [formula] for a prescribed code C. To find all admissible partitions of [formula] into codes with the given size distribution that are divided into orbits by H, we search for sets [formula] for which each Oi is an orbit of a code under H and [formula] is an admissible partition of [formula]. The algorithm does this by first finding the orbits of codes of size M1 and then finding the orbits of codes of size M2. In the search for an admissible partition, one needs to make sure that the codes are nonintersecting. When searching for the orbits of codes of size M2, the additional requirement that all words should be included into some code is beneficial for the search; compare the difference between the routines [formula] and [formula]. In principle, the calls to [formula] and [formula] could be combined into one call to [formula] but the current approach saves memory and enables more efficient parallelization.

Orbits of codes are produced by the function [formula]. This function finds all orbits where the codes are pairwise disjoint and disjoint from C. A naive method is here sufficient, looping over representatives C' of all equivalence classes of codes of the given size and over all elements g∈Gn to get codes gC'. Codes with nontrivial automorphism groups are then reported more than once, but the duplicate orbits can be removed afterwards.

Once the entire search is ready, isomorphic partitions are rejected and the automorphism group orders are determined for all solutions. One may consider the partitions as colorings of the graph Q2n - 1 and use nauty for those graphs. Handling colorings with indistinguishable colors is described in the nauty manual.

Results

The search for admissible partitions with automorphism group order at least 2 containing the doubly extended Hamming code yielded 2266 nonisomorphic partitions. Out of these, 266 have an automorphism group of order 2 and the other 2000 have an automorphism group of order 4. The search required 5650 days of CPU time on a single core of Intel Core i7 870 processor. CPU times reported later are for a single core of that processor. The computations were carried out in a computer cluster.

For other cases, the numbers of partitions found are shown in Table [\ref=tab:results] along with the required CPU time, grouped by the size distribution and the size of the initial code C in the search. Note that the line corresponding to the distribution 16  +  12  ×  20 does not include the search starting from the doubly extended Hamming code. The two separate cases with size distribution 4  ×  19  +  9  ×  20 yielded no common partitions.

The number of partitions with each automorphism group order at least 3 are listed in Table [\ref=tab:automs]. In addition, there are 266 partitions that have automorphism group of order 2 where one code is the doubly extended Hamming code.

Two of the partitions found, one with distribution 2  ×  18  +  11  ×  20 and one with distribution 4  ×  19  +  9  ×  20, contain codes that are not maximal. Augmenting these codes yield five new nonisomorphic partitions in total, two with trivial automorphism group, which have distributions 18  +  2  ×  19  +  10  ×  20 and 4  ×  19  +  10  ×  20, and three with automorphism group order 2, one of which have distribution 18  +  2  ×  19  +  10  ×  20 and two of which have distribution 4  ×  19  +  10  ×  20.

We present here a partition with distribution 16 + 12  ×  20 that has an automorphism group of order 48. Because all codes of size 20 in this partition lie on the same orbit under the automorphism group, it suffices to list an even (9,16,4) code C0, an even (9,20,4) code C1, and two isomorphisms g1, g2 that generate the automorphism group. An isomorphism g is given as a pair (π,c), where π is a permutation of [formula] and c is a word in [formula] such that g maps each word [formula] to a word that has [formula] at the ith coordinate for each i.

[formula]

This result gives an infinite family of colorings of Q2n.

[formula] for i  ≥  0.

The result follows from [formula] and the bound [formula] [\cite=O04].

For example, Theorem [\ref=thm:infinite] gives that [formula], but we are not able to determine the exact chromatic number in that case. By 5632  ≤  A(17,3)  ≤  6552 [\cite=LO16] [\cite=BBMOS78] and [\eqref=eq:lower], we know that [formula], and finding better bounds for A(17,3) would not be able to improve the bound given by [\eqref=eq:lower] beyond 24.

Double counting

To increase confidence in the computational results, we perform a consistency check by double counting. The counting is done separately for every size distribution of C and size of the code C listed in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:subgroup]. We find the number of triples (C,C,H) where C is an admissible partition of [formula] with the given size distribution, C is a code in C of the given size, H is a group that is a subgroup of [formula] and [formula], and |H| is one of the possibilities in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:subgroup]. We obtain this number in two ways.

The first way is as follows. For each partition C, let N(C) be the number of pairs (C,H) such that (C,C,H) is a triple to be counted. This can be found computationally by looping over all subgroups H of [formula] of admissible order and every code C of the fixed size and checking whether [formula]. Because N(C) = N(D) when C and D are isomorphic, and the number of partitions isomorphic to C is [formula], the count can be obtained by

[formula]

where the sum is taken over equivalence class representatives of colorings that are found in the search.

On the other hand, for each pair (C,H) where C is a code of the fixed size and [formula] is of admissible size, let N(C,H) be the number of colorings for which (C,C,H) is a triple to be counted. This is the number of colorings found in the search starting from C and H. Because N(C,H)  =  N(gC,gHg- 1) for every g∈Gn, the count can be obtained by looking at only one C from each equivalence class of codes and only one H from each conjugacy class of subgroups of [formula]. As this is exactly what is done in the search, the count can be obtained computationally by

[formula]

where X(C,H) is the number of subgroups of [formula] conjugate to H and the sum is taken over all pairs (C,H) for which the search was performed. To this end, the numbers X(C,H) and N(C,H) are stored during the search.

Extending colorings

In an attempt to find a 13-coloring of Q29, one may check whether the classified 13-colorings of Q28 can occur as a subgraph of such a coloring. Consider an admissible partition [formula] of [formula]. Each code Ci can be written as [formula], where Di is an even-weight code of length 9 with minimum distance 4 and Ei is an odd-weight code of length 9 with minimum distance 4. Now [formula] is an admissible partition of [formula] and [formula] also corresponds to an admissible partition of [formula] if for example the last bit is complemented in each codeword.

Given an admissible partition [formula] of [formula], we are to determine whether it can be extended to a coloring of [formula] in the way described above. The number of ways to express 256, the size of [formula], as a sum of 13 integers smaller than or equal to 20 equals the number of ways to express 13  ×  20  -  256  =  4 as a sum of 13 nonnegative integers, which is 1820. Therefore, there are 1820 possible choices for the sizes of the codes in E when the order matters. The algorithm now runs as follows. In Steps 1 and 2 of a complete search, representatives of all classified colorings and all possible choices of sizes Mi are considered, respectively.

Consider an admissible partition [formula] of [formula].

Fix the sizes of the codes in E, denoted by [formula], where Mi  ≤  20 and [formula].

For all [formula], find all possible codes Ei such that |Ei| = Mi and [formula] has minimum distance 4.

Find a partition of [formula] from all possible sets [formula].

The task in Step 3 can be formulated in the framework of clique search: starting from [formula], we remove the words that have distance less than 3 to a word in Di (because having such a codeword in Ei would result to a pair of codewords in Ci that would have distance less than 4) and consider the graph over the remaining codewords that has an edge between each pair of codewords with Hamming distance at least 4. Now a possible code Ei corresponds to a clique of the size Mi in that graph. To search for cliques in the graph, we use the software Cliquer [\cite=NO03].

The task in Step 4 is an instance of the exact cover problem: Given a set X and a family S of subsets of X, enumerate all subsets of S that contain each element of X exactly once. We use libexact to solve the instances. Actually, it suffices to let [formula] with all possible sets [formula] in S.

None of the known partitions of [formula] could be extended to an admissible partition of [formula] containing 13 codes. The search required 146 hours of CPU time.
