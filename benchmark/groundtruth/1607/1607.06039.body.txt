The convolution sum [formula] for [formula]

THE CONVOLUTION SUM Wa,b(n) FOR (a,b) = (1,28),(4,7),(1,14),(2,7),(1,7)

Introduction

Let [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] denote the sets of positive integers, nonnegative integers, integers and complex numbers respectively. For [formula] the sum of divisors function σk(n) is defined by [formula], where d runs through the positive divisors of n. If [formula] we set σk(n) = 0. We write σ(n) for σ1(n). For [formula] with a  ≤  b we define the convolution sum Wa,b(n) by

[formula]

Set g  =   gcd (a,b). Clearly

[formula]

Hence we may suppose that gcd (a,b) = 1. The convolution sum Wa,b(n) has been evaluated for

[formula]

See, for example, [\cite=convo27] [\cite=ChanCooper] [\cite=CooperToh] [\cite=CooperYe] [\cite=Huard] [\cite=lemire] [\cite=ramak] [\cite=royer] [\cite=Xia] [\cite=Ye].

In this paper we evaluate the convolution sum Wa,b(n) for

[formula]

We use a modular form approach. The sum W1,14(n) has been evaluated by Royer [\cite=royer], and the sum W1,7(n) has been evaluated by Lemire and Williams [\cite=lemire] and later by Cooper and Toh [\cite=CooperToh]. We re-evaluate the sums W1,14(n) and W1,7(n) with our method. Our results for the sums W1,14(n) and W1,7(n) agree with those in [\cite=royer] and [\cite=lemire] [\cite=CooperToh], respectively.

For [formula] let Rl(n) denote the number of representations of n by the octonary quadratic form [formula], namely

[formula]

Explicit formulas for Rl(n) are known for l = 1,2,3,4,5,6,8, see, for example, [\cite=octo1236] [\cite=lomadze] [\cite=CooperYe] [\cite=ramak] [\cite=convo27]. We use the evaluations of the convolution sums W1,28(n), W4,7(n) and W1,7(n) to determine an explicit formula for R7(n).

Finally we compare our evaluations of the sums W1,7(n) and W1,14(n) with the evaluations of Lemire and Williams [\cite=lemire] and Royer [\cite=royer] to express the modular forms Δ4,7(z), Δ4,14,1(z) and Δ4,14,2(z) (given in [\cite=lemire] [\cite=royer]) as linear combinations of eta quotients.

Preliminary results

Let [formula] and [formula]. Let Γ0(N) be the modular subgroup defined by

[formula]

We write Mk(Γ0(N)) to denote the space of modular forms of weight k and level N. It is known (see for example [\cite=stein]) that

[formula]

where Ek(Γ0(N)) and Sk(Γ0(N)) are the corresponding subspaces of Eisenstein forms and cusp forms of weight k with trivial multiplier system for the modular subgroup Γ0(N).

The Dedekind eta function η(z) is the holomorphic function defined on the upper half plane [formula] by the product formula

[formula]

We set q: = q(z) = e2πiz. Then we can express the Dedekind eta function η(z) in (2.2) as

[formula]

A product of the form

[formula]

where [formula], not all zero, is called an eta quotient. We define the following nine eta quotients

[formula]

and integers cr(n) ([formula]) for r∈{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} by

[formula]

We use the following theorem to determine if a given eta quotient f(z) is in [formula]. See [\cite=Kilford] and [\cite=Kohler].

Let [formula] and [formula] be an eta quotient. Let [formula] and [formula]. Suppose that the following conditions are satisfied:

(i) [formula],

(ii) [formula],

(iii) [formula] for each positive divisor d of N,

(iv) k is an even integer,

(v) s is the square of a rational number.

Then f(z) is in [formula].

(iii)' In addition to the above conditions, if the inequality in (iii) is strict for each positive divisor d of N, then f(z) is in Sk(Γ0(N)).

We note that we have used MAPLE to find the above eta quotients Cj(q) for 1  ≤  j  ≤  9 in a way that they satisfy Theorem 2.1 for N = 28 and k = 4.

The Eisenstein series L(q) and M(q) are defined as

[formula]

respectively. We use Theorem 2.1 and the Eisenstein series M(q) to give a basis for the modular space M4(Γ0(28)) in the following theorem.

{M(qt)|t = 1,2,4,7,14,28} is a basis for E4(Γ0(28)).

(b)  {Cj(q)|1  ≤  k  ≤  9} is a basis for S4(Γ0(28)).

(c)  [formula] is a basis for M4(Γ0(28)).

(a)  Appealing to [\cite=Kilford] or [\cite=stein], we see that dim (E4(Γ0(28))) = 6. Then we see from [\cite=stein] that {M(qt)|t = 1,2,4,7,14,28} is a basis for E4(Γ0(28)).

(b)  It follows from Theorem 2.1 that each Cj(q) is in S4(Γ0(28)) for 1  ≤  j  ≤  9. By [\cite=Kilford] or [\cite=stein], we have dim (S4(Γ0(28))) = 9. One can see that there is no linear relationship among the eta quotients Cj(q) ~ (1  ≤  j  ≤  9). Thus, {Cj(q)|1  ≤  j  ≤  9} constitute a basis for S4(Γ0(28)).

(c)  The assertion follows from (a), (b) and (2.1).

We use the Sturm bound S(N) to show the equality of two modular forms in the same modular space. The following theorem gives S(N) for M4(Γ0(N)), see [\cite=Kilford] for a general case.

Let f(z), ~ g(z)∈M4(Γ0(N)) with the Fourier series expansions [formula] and [formula]. The Sturm bound S(N) for the modular space M4(Γ0(N)) is given by

[formula]

and so if [formula] for all n  ≤  S(N) then f(z)  =  g(z).

By Theorem 2.3, the Sturm bound for the modular space M4(Γ0(N)) is

[formula]

Using (2.16) and Theorem 2.2 we prove Theorem 2.4. We then use Theorem 2.4 to determine explicit formulas for our convolution sums in the next section.

We have

[formula]

We prove only the first and fourth equalities as the remaining three can be proven similarly. Let us prove the first equality. By [\cite=stein] we have L(q)  -  28L(q28)∈M2(Γ0(28)), and so

[formula]

By Theorem 2.2(c) there exist coefficients [formula] such that

[formula]

Appealing to (2.16), we equate the coefficients of qn for 0  ≤  n  ≤  16 on both sides of (2.17), and have a system of linear equations with 17 equations and 15 unknowns. By using MAPLE we solve this system and find the asserted coefficients.

Let us now prove the fourth equality. We have

[formula]

By [\cite=stein], we have

[formula]

Thus it follows from (2.18) and (2.19) that 2L(q2)  -  7L(q7)∈M2(Γ0(14)), and so

[formula]

As M4(Γ0(14))  ⊂  M4(Γ0(28)), we have [formula]. Thus by Theorem 2.2(c) there exist coefficients [formula] such that

[formula]

We equate the coefficients of qn for 0  ≤  n  ≤  16 on both sides of (2.20) to obtain the asserted coefficients. Alternatively, one can show that {Cj(q)|1  ≤  k  ≤  4} is a basis for S4(Γ0(14)), and find the asserted cofficients for the formulas of W2,7(n), W1,14(n) and W1,7(n) accordingly.

Evaluating the convolution sum Wa,b(n)

We now present explicit formulas for the convolution sum Wa,b(n) for (a,b) = (1,28),(4,7),(1,14),(2,7),(1,7). We make use of Theorem 2.4 and the classical identity

[formula]

see for example [\cite=glaisher].

Let [formula]. Then

[formula]

We prove the theorem only for the convolution sum W1,28(n) as the other four sums can be proven similarly. Replacing q by q28 in (3.1), we obtain

[formula]

We have

[formula]

We obtain from (3.1)-(3.3) that

[formula]

We equate the coefficients of qn on the right hand sides of [formula] in (3.4) and the first part of Theorem 2.4, and solve for W1,28(n) to obtain the asserted formula.

Let [formula]. Then

[formula]

For [formula] let r4(n) denote the number of representations of n as sum of four squares, namely

[formula]

so that r4(0) = 1. It is a classical result of Jacobi, see for example [\cite=williams-3], that

[formula]

By (1.2) and (3.5) we have

[formula]

We need to determine the last sum in (3.6). Using (3.5) we obtain

[formula]

The assertion now follows from (3.6) and (3.7).

We deduce the following corollary from Theorems 3.1 and 3.2.

Let [formula]. Then

[formula]

We substitute the formulas of W1,28(n), W4,7(n), W1,7(n) and W1,7(n / 4) from Theorem 3.1 into the right hand side of R7(n) in Theorem 3.2 to obtain the formula

[formula]

By Theorem 2.1, one can see that C1(q4) and C2(q4) are in S4(Γ0(56)), and so we have C1(q4)  +  C2(q4)∈S4(Γ0(56)). By Theorem 2.2(b), we know that Cj(q) ~ (1  ≤  j  ≤  9) are in S4(Γ0(28))  ⊂  S4(Γ0(56)). We want to see if there exist coefficients [formula] such that

[formula]

By Theorem 2.3, the Sturm bound for the modular space M4(Γ0(56)) is S(56)  =  32. By using MAPLE we equate the coefficients of qn for 1  ≤  n  ≤  32 on both sides of (3.9) and have a system of linear equations with 32 equations and nine unknowns. We then solve this system to obtain the identity

[formula]

We deduce from (3.10) that, for [formula],

[formula]

The asserted expression for R7(n) now follows by substituting (3.11) into (3.8).

Expressing Δ4,7(z), [formula] and [formula] as linear combinations of eta quotients

In this section we present our observations regarding two results given by Lemire and Williams [\cite=lemire] and Royer [\cite=royer] respectively. We express the modular forms Δ4,7(z), [formula] and [formula] as linear combinations of eta quotients. We refer the reader to [\cite=royer] for the definitions of Δ4,7(z), [formula] and [formula].

We first present our observation for the sum W1,7(n) given in [\cite=lemire] and express the cusp form Δ4,7(z) as a linear combination of two eta quotients. The sum W1,7(n) has been given by Lemire and Williams [\cite=lemire] as

[formula]

where u(n) is defined by

[formula]

and

[formula]

It follows from (2.3) and (4.3) that

[formula]

Then (4.2) becomes

[formula]

See also [\cite=CooperToh]. Equating the right hand sides of the sum W1,7(n) in Theorem 3.1 and (4.1), we obtain

[formula]

where c1(n) and c2(n) are given by (2.13). Thus appealing to (4.5), (4.4), (2.13), (2.5), (2.4) and the Sturm bound given in (2.16), we express Δ4,7(z) as a linear combination of two eta quotients as

[formula]

We now present our observation for the sum W1,14(n) given in [\cite=royer] and express [formula] and [formula] as linear combinations of eta quotients. The sum W1,14(n) has been given by Royer [\cite=royer] as

[formula]

where τ4,7(n) and τ4,7(n / 2) are given by (4.6), and the values of τ4,14,1(n) and τ4,14,2(n) for 1  ≤  n  ≤  22 are given in Tables 6 and 7 of [\cite=royer], respectively. Using the values of τ4,14,1(n) and τ4,14,2(n) in [\cite=royer] and appealing to the Sturm bound given in (2.16) we express the modular forms [formula] and [formula] as linear combinations of our eta quotients as

[formula]
