Product Theorem for K-stability

Introduction

All the varieties in the present article are assumed to be defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 unless otherwise mentioned.

The α-invariant originally introduced by Tian ([\cite=T87]) has played significant roles in the study of Kähler-Einstein metrics and K-stability of Fano varieties. The original definition of the α-invariant was given in an analytic way. However, there is an algebraic way to define the α-invariant over an arbitrary algebraically closed field of characteristic zero ([\cite=ChS08]).

Let X be a [formula]-Fano variety. The α-invariant of X is the number

[formula]

Even though it was introduced originally for Kähler-Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds, the α-invariant is reborn as a sufficient condition for K-stability due to Fujita, Odaka, and Sano.

Let X be a [formula]-Fano variety. Either if

[formula]

or if [formula] and X is smooth, then the pair (X, - KX) is K-stable.

This is a powerful algebro-geometric tool to test K-stability of Fano varieties. For instance, it can prove that every smooth hypersurface of degree n in [formula], n  ≥  3, is K-stable.

However, since the sufficient condition for K-stability by the α-invariant involves the dimensions of Fano varieties as in [\eqref=inequality], the following theorem shows that the α-invariant is paralyzed in testing K-stability of products of Fano varieties.

Let X and Y be Fano varieties with at worst Gorenstein canonical singularities. Then

[formula]

See [\cite=ChS08].

Recently Fujita and Odaka provided another algebro-geometric way to test K-(semi)stability of Fano varieties not through their test configurations.

Let X be a [formula]-Fano variety and let m be a positive integer such that | - mKX| is non-empty. Set [formula]. For a section s of H0(X,OX( - mKX)), we denote the effective divisor of the section s by D(s). If [formula] sections [formula] form a basis of the space H0(X,OX( - mKX)), then the anticanonical [formula]-divisor

[formula]

is said to be of m-basis type. For a positive integer m, we set

[formula]

We set δm(X) = 0, if | - mKX| is empty. The δ-invariant of X is defined by the number

[formula]

Using the δ-invariant, Fujita and Odaka set up a conjectural criterion for K-(semi)stability. They then proved that the δ-invariant gives a sufficient condition for K-(semi)stability.

A [formula]-Fano variety X is K-stable (resp. K-semistable) with respect to - KX if and only if δ(X) > 1 (resp. ≥  1).

Note that Conjecture [\ref=conjecture] is true if Berman-Gibbs stability ([\cite=F16a]) is equivalent to K-stability.

A [formula]-Fano variety X is K-stable (resp. K-semistable) with respect to - KX if δ(X) > 1 (resp. ≥  1).

See [\cite=FO16].

Unlike the α-invariant, the δ-invariant keeps its ability to test K-stability in products of Fano varieties. The aim of the present article is to verify the following theorem.

It is expected that Product Theorem should hold good without the condition that Y is smooth. The reason why Product Theorem requires the smoothness of Y is simply because we failed to verify Lemma [\ref=lemma:Viehweg] without this condition.

Together with verified Conjecture [\ref=conjecture], Product Theorem could prove

[formula]

and

[formula]

Only with Theorem [\ref=sufficient], Product Theorem is able to show

[formula]

and

[formula]

For instance, a product of smooth del Pezzo surfaces of degrees ≤  5 is K-stable since a smooth del Pezzo surface S of degree ≤  5 has its δ-invariant strictly bigger than 1 (see [\cite=PW16]). The product of smooth del Pezzo surfaces of degrees ≤  5 and the projective plane is K-semistable since [formula] (see [\cite=PW16]).

Preliminaries

Let X be a normal projective variety and [formula] be [formula]-divisors on X such that each pair (X,Di) is log canonical at a point p on X. For non-negative integers [formula] with [formula], the pair

[formula]

is log canonical at p.

This is a well known fact. Since it is easy to prove, we omit its proof.

The following lemma is a variant of [\cite=V95]. This will play an essential role in our proof of Product Theorem.

Let X be a [formula]-factorial projective variety with only Kawamata log terminal singularities and let Y be a smooth projective variety. Let D be a [formula]-divisor on X  ×  Y. For a positive rational number λ, suppose that (X  ×  Y,λD) is not log canonical at a point (p,q)∈X  ×  Y. Write [formula], where Di are prime divisors whose supports contain X  ×  {q} and Δ is a [formula]-divisor whose support does not contain X  ×  {q}. Then either (X  ×  {q},λΔ|X  ×  {q}) is not log canonical at p or λai > 1 for some i.

We first suppose that dim (Y) = 1. Then

[formula]

If λa  ≤  1, then the pair (X  ×  Y,(X  ×  {q}) + λΔ) is not log canonical at the point (p,q). Then, by Adjunction, the pair (X  ×  {q},λΔ|X  ×  {q}) is not log canonical at p.

Assume that the statement holds good for the cases with dim (Y) < n. We then suppose that the dimension of Y is n. We take a general smooth hypersurface H of Y passing through the point q. It is obvious that (X  ×  Y,X  ×  H + λD) is not log canonical at (p,q). Since (X  ×  Y,X  ×  H) is plt, the pair (X  ×  H,λD|X  ×  H) is not log canonical at (p,q). Note that

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. By the induction hypothesis, either

[formula]

is not log canonical at p or λai > 1 for some i. Since

[formula]

the statement is true for the case with dim (Y) = n.

The lemma below explains how to obtain anticanonical [formula]-divisors of basis type on a factor of the product of Fano varieties from an anticanonical [formula]-divisor of basis type on a given product of Fano varieties. This is another key player in the proof of Product Theorem.

Let X and Y be [formula]-Fano varieties and let m be a positive integer such that neither | - mKX| nor | - mKY| is empty. Let D be an anticanonical [formula]-divisor of m-basis type on X  ×  Y. For a point q in Y, write [formula], where Di are prime divisors whose supports contain X  ×  {q} and Δ is a [formula]-divisor whose support does not contain X  ×  {q}. Then the restricted divisor

[formula]

is a [formula]-linear combination of anticanonical [formula]-divisors of m-basis type on X. Moreover, if the linear system | - mKY| is base-point-free, then

[formula]

Let [formula] be a basis for H0(X,OX( - mKX)) and let [formula] for H0(Y,OY( - mKY)). Put [formula]. We may assume that tj(q)  ≠  0 for 1  ≤  j  ≤  r and tj(q) = 0 for [formula]. If | - mKY| is base-point-free, then r  ≥  1.

Let [formula] be in sections H0(X  ×  Y,OX  ×  Y( - mKX  ×  Y)) that form a basis. Then for each k, we have

[formula]

where ak;ij are constants. Suppose that the divisor D is defined by the basis [formula]. Then we obtain

[formula]

Since the [formula] matrix (ak;ij) is non-singular, the [formula]-divisor

[formula]

is an anticanonical [formula]-divisor of m-basis type on X.

Product Theorem

In this section, we prove Product Theorem.

Proof of Product Theorem. Let m be a positive integer. Put [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Let [formula] be sections of H0(X,OX( - mKX)) that form a basis. Let [formula] be sections of H0(Y,OY( - mKY)) that form a basis. Since [formula] is a basis for H0(X  ×  Y,OX  ×  Y( - mKX  ×  Y)), the anticanonical [formula]-divisor

[formula]

on X  ×  Y is of m-basis type. Identify X as X  ×  {y} and Y as {x}  ×  Y, where x and y are general points in X and Y, respectively. For a positive rational number λ  <  δm(X  ×  Y), the pair (X  ×  Y,λD) is Kawamata log terminal, and hence both (X,λD|X) and (Y,λD|Y) are Kawamata log terminal (see [\cite=K97]). Since

[formula]

we obtain [formula]

Now we suppose that [formula] Choose a rational number λ such that [formula] Then there are sections [formula] of H0(X  ×  Y,OX  ×  Y( - mKX  ×  Y)) such that they form a basis of H0(X  ×  Y,OX  ×  Y( - mKX  ×  Y)) and the pair (X  ×  Y,λD) is not log canonical at some point (p,q) on X  ×  Y, where

[formula]

We write

[formula]

where Di are prime divisors whose supports contain X  ×  {q} and Δ is a [formula]-divisor whose support does not contain X  ×  {q}. It follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:Viehweg] that either (X  ×  {q},λΔ|X  ×  {q}) is not log canonical at p or λai > 1 for some i.

If λai > 1 for some i, then take a general point x in X and we see that ({x}  ×  Y,λD|{x}  ×  Y) is not log canonical at q. Lemma [\ref=lemma:restricted_basis] implies that the divisor D|{x}  ×  Y is a [formula]-linear combination of anticanonical [formula]-divisors of m-basis type on {x}  ×  Y. Moreover, [formula] Then Lemma [\ref=lemma:convex] yields an absurd inequality λ  ≥  δm(Y). Therefore, (X  ×  {q},λΔ|X  ×  {q}) is not log canonical at p. Lemma [\ref=lemma:restricted_basis] again implies that the divisor Δ|X  ×  {q} is a [formula]-linear combination of anticanonical [formula]-divisors of m-basis type on X  ×  {q} and that

[formula]

for some positive rational number μ  ≤  1. Then Lemma [\ref=lemma:convex] yields an absurd inequality λ  ≥  δm(X). Consequently, we obtain [formula]

Let X and Y be [formula]-Fano varieties. Suppose that either X or Y is smooth. Under the assumption that Conjecture [\ref=conjecture] is true, X and Y are K-stable (resp. K-semistable) if and only if X  ×  Y is K-stable (resp. K-semistable) with respect to their anticanonical polarisations.
