Dielectric surface loss in superconducting resonators with flux-trapping holes

Superconducting coplanar waveguide (SCPW) resonators are extensively used in astronomy[\cite=day2003] [\cite=mazin2012] and quantum information [\cite=mariantoni2011] [\cite=barends2013] [\cite=jeffrey2014]. An important frontier in SCPW resonator development is increasing the intrinsic quality factor Qi. This is an especially important proxy for qubit performance, since the resonator Qi is strongly correlated with the qubit relaxation time T1. Quantum computers require small operating temperatures [formula], single-photon excitation energies, low magnetic fields [formula], and high coherence [formula]. In this quantum computing regime, dominant loss mechanisms are two-level state (TLS) defects in amorphous dielectrics located at surfaces and loss from trapped flux in magnetic vortices.

In this Letter, we examine the tradeoff between increased TLS loss and reduced magnetic vortex loss that occurs when the ground plane of SCPW resonators is patterned with an array of holes. Although hole arrays have long been known to eliminate dissipation from trapped flux, [\cite=song2009b] [\cite=bothner2011] [\cite=bothner2012] these structures have not been studied in the quantum computing regime for the possibility of increasing TLS loss. Our data shows that dielectric TLS loss from flux-trapping holes is an important physical limitation if designed incorrectly.

When a thin-film superconductor is cooled through its transition temperature Tc in a magnetic field [formula], it is energetically favorable for magnetic flux to be trapped as vortices at some defect[\cite=stan2004]. The typical spacing between vortices or an edge of the superconducting film to a vortex is [formula]. As the superconducting order parameter has to vanish[\cite=tinkham], this normal core produces dissipation in response to currents flowing past the core[\cite=song2009a]. With a hole in the film, vortices form without a normal core and produce no dissipation. We note that suitably positioned normal-core vortices may be beneficial as quasiparticle traps[\cite=nsanzineza2014] [\cite=wang2014]. For this application, hole arrays should be positioned properly to engineer the number and position of the normal-core vortices.

Because the holes have sharp edges and expose the substrate, they introduce new dissipation sites from surface TLS defects. As modern high-Q resonators are sensitive to nanometer thick amorphous dielectrics at surfaces[\cite=wenner2011], these additional edges can increase loss if the holes are placed near the resonator where the electric fields are the largest. Consequently, we must determine how closely holes can be safely placed from the resonator.

We characterize this loss with quarter-wavelength SCPW resonators that are capacitively coupled to a feedline, with frequency multiplexing to measure 10 resonators per chip. An optical image of a device wirebonded in a mount is shown in Fig. [\ref=Schematic](a). The resonators have fundamental frequencies between 4.6 GHz and 5.5 GHz and center trace and gap dimensions of [formula] and [formula]. Our circuit contains both resonators with and without ground-plane holes for direct comparison. Our arrays are made from square holes of side length [formula] and an edge to edge separation d of [formula], [formula], or [formula]. An example is shown in Fig. [\ref=Schematic](b). The equivalent circuit diagram for this device near resonance is shown in Fig. [\ref=Schematic](c) and was analysed in detail in Ref. [\cite=megrant2012].

Our resonator circuits were fabricated from aluminium thin films grown on c-plane sapphire substrates. The first type is made in a conventional electron beam deposition system with base pressure of ~ 3  ×  10- 8  . Films from this tool yield resonators with Qi≃8  ×  105 near a measurement photon number [formula] and are thus representative of resonators made with standard deposition techniques. The second type was prepared in a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system with a base pressure of ~  1  ×  10- 11  . With an in-situ [formula] plasma cleaning of the substrate at 650 [formula]C [\cite=megrant2012], we found lower resonator loss Qi≃1.5  ×  106 for [formula]. The high quality factors make the MBE grown resonators sensitive probes of subtle decoherence mechanisms that may be induced by the holes. The resonators and holes were etched simultaneously in an inductively coupled plasma using BCl3 and Cl2.

For measurement, individual devices were wirebonded in Al sample mounts and anchored to the cold stage of an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR). A schematic of our apparatus is shown in Fig. [\ref=Schematic](d). The  40 mK ADR base temperature is well below the transition temperature Tc≃1.1   of Al, so the thermal quasiparticle density is negligible. Additionally, our cryostat includes extensive infra-red (IR) radiation shielding composed of in-line coaxial IR filters and a light tight sample compartment that reduces the non-equilibrium quasiparticle population below our measurement sensitivity [\cite=barends2011]. A circulator on the output line of the chip reduces noise from the input of the high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier. A solenoid encircles the sample compartment allowing us to apply a magnetic field perpendicular to the film, with 500  μ resolution to measure the magnetic field dependence of our resonator Qi. We surround the mount with a magnetic shield and remove all magnetic components, including SMA connectors, screws and experimental hardware, reducing the ambient magnetic field at the device to [formula].

The loss is determined by measuring the resonator intrinsic quality factor Qi using transmission spectroscopy[\cite=megrant2012]. In the initial measurement phase, we measure Qi versus applied magnetic field at high power for better signal to noise ratio, since vortex loss is independent of power[\cite=bothner2011]. To vary [formula], we raise the device temperature above [formula], set the applied magnetic field [formula], and cool the sample back through its [formula] in this field thereby trapping magnetic vortices. Once the device has returned to its base temperature we extract the resonator Qi from S21 measurements with a vector network analyzer (VNA).

Figure [\ref=Resonator_Measurements](a) shows the magnetic field dependence of Qi for resonators with and without ground plane holes from the MBE device. For resonators without a patterned ground plane there is a well defined maximum of Qi that identifies the applied field that zeros the total magnetic field; this offset between [formula] and [formula] is indicated by the arrow. We observe a gradual but significant increase in loss away from this field that is attributed to a greater density of magnetic vortices trapped in the ground plane. As expected, for resonators with holes we find that Qi is nearly independent of applied magnetic field until the critical field for vortex formation in the center trace has been exceeded.

For MBE grown resonators with hole patterns, data in the field range of [formula] mG allows us to estimate the residual magnetic loss. Assuming an excess loss model that is linear in the magnetic field, we find with 99% confidence[\cite=chiaro2015supp] the residual magnetic loss is 9  ±  4  ×  10- 11 /mG. Although additional experiments are required to determine the origin and proper functional dependence of this excess loss, we suggest likely models are coupling to vortices in remote areas of the device not protected by the hole overlays or quasiparticles generated by the local suppression of Tc due to the magnetic field. For typical shielded devices, this bound is several orders of magnitude below the loss of the best SCPW resonators.

After measuring the magnetic field dependence of the high power Qi we quantify the surface loss due from TLS defects by measuring the power dependence of the resonator Qi. First, we use a value of [formula] that maximizes Qi at high power, as discussed previously. The power dependence data for the MBE device is shown in Fig. [\ref=Resonator_Measurements](b), where the lines are fits to a standard TLS loss model [\cite=wang2009]

[formula]

This model decomposes the total internal loss of the resonator 1 / Qi into a power independent loss term 1 / Q0 that includes such loss modes from quasiparticles and radiation, and a power dependent term of magnitude [formula] that comes from TLS defects. Here [formula] is the excitation number of photons in the resonator and [formula] describes the saturation field of the TLS bath. The parameter α is related to the electric field distribution of the resonator, which for the fits shown here is 0.8, a typical value.

Figure [\ref=Resonator_Measurements](c) and (d) show the quality factors for the low power ([formula]) and high power (Q0) regimes, extracted from the fits in (b). The data points represent resonators from two circuits from each film. In (c), we see that the densest hole pattern increases TLS loss by roughly 25% relative to resonators without holes for both the MBE and ebeam grown resonators. Controlling for the difference between the MBE and ebeam films in a linear regression, we find that the loss 1 / Qi directly attributable to the dense hole pattern is 2.7  ±  1.4  ×  10- 7, where the uncertainty represents the root mean squared error. When using the resonators for quantum devices at low magnetic fields, this increase is undesirable. The hole spacing should thus be carefully chosen, first to be close enough to provide protection from external fields of magnitude ~  Φ0 / d2, where d is the edge to edge spacing between holes[\cite=stan2004]. However, the spacing from the resonator to the first row of holes should be greater than about 6  μ, a value that did not exhibit measurable excess TLS loss. In (d) we observe that the Q0 of resonators with the densest hole pattern is nearly the same as that without any hole overlay. This indicates that power independent loss mechanisms were not effected by the hole patterns.

We have characterized dissipation from arrays of flux-trapping holes in SCPW resonators. We find that excess dielectric loss can be made vanishingly small by increasing the distance between the resonator edge and the array. In our experiment, a 6 [formula] separation was enough to remove excess dielectric loss; power-independent loss mechanisms were not affected by the arrays. We also estimate the residual magnetic loss tangent in resonators with ground plane holes to be ~   10- 10 /mG, showing that SCPW resonators can be made insensitive to small magnetic fields without magnifying other loss mechanisms.

In the main text we infer resonator loss 1/Qi by measuring the system scattering parameters (S-parameters) of superconducting coplanar waveguide (SCPW) resonators capacitively coupled to a feedline. The circuit model for this system has been analysed previously [\cite=megrant2012] and gives the result

[formula]

Here S̃- 121 is the inverse of transmission data calibrated to enforce S21 = 1 far off resonance. f0 and φ are the resonant frequency and impedance mismatch angle and Q*c is the coupling quality factor scaled by an impedance ratio.

We extract the internal quality factor Qi and its statistical uncertainty σQi by fitting measurements of our device to this model. Figure [\ref=spectroscopyS21] shows example data from the MBE sample for which the Qi  =  1.86  ×  107  ±  2.58  ×  105. This is representative of the data points shown in Fig [\ref=novortexdata].

Fig. [\ref=novortexdata] breaks out the data in Fig. 2a of the main text for resonators with ground plane holes from the MBE sample in the region from [formula] = 14 mG to 64 mG. This is below the critical field for vortex formation in both the center trace of the resonator and in the ground plane near the resonator where there are ground plane holes. Thus, we do not expect magnetic loss in this region. In Fig. [\ref=novortexdata] we apply a linear loss model 1 / Qi = m ×   [formula] + b to the data and obtain the parameters m and b with a weighted least squares fit. We use weighting factors [formula], where [formula] in terms of parameters extracted directly from device data.

The 1 - α confidence interval for the true mean of an observable with sample mean [formula] and standard error of the mean [formula] is x̄  ±  tn - 1,α / 2sx̄ where t is the t-distribution, s is the sample variance, n is the number of measurements, and α is the probability that the true value of the observable lies outside the confidence interval.[\cite=peters2001] We report the 99% confidence interval for the parameter m in our magnetic loss model to be [formula] /mG. As the origin of this loss has not been determined, we claim this as an upper bound on the residual magnetic loss in superconducting resonators that have their ground plane patterned with flux-trapping holes.
