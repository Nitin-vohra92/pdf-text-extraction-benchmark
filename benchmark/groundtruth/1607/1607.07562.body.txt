Weierstrass-Enneper representation for Maximal Surfaces in Hodographic coordinates

Introduction

A maximal surface in Lorentz-Minkowski space [formula] is a spacelike surface whose mean curvature is zero everywhere. Any spacelike surface in [formula] can be expressed locally as a graph (x,y,φ(x,y)) of some smooth function φ which satisfies φ2x  +  φ2y < 1. Then any graph in [formula] is maximal if φ satisfies the following equation [\cite=kobasingu]

[formula]

These surfaces, more generally, constant mean curvature surfaces are important in classical relativity[\cite=marsden]. Similar to the case of minimal surfaces in [formula] [\cite=osser], there exists a Weierstrass-Enneper formula for maximal surfaces in [formula] [\cite=kobamax]. In fact, any maximal surface in [formula] is represented as

[formula]

f is a holomorphic function on D, g is a meromorphic function on D, fg2 is holomorphic on D and |g(τ)|  ≠  1 for τ∈D. For a spacelike surface in [formula], the Gauss map G is defined as a map which assigns to a point of the surface S, the unit normal vector at that point. Therefore one can regard [formula], [formula] is a spacelike surface which has constant negative curvature - 1 with respect to the induced metric. We can define a stereographic map σ for [formula] as

[formula] by

[formula] and σ(  ∞  ) = (0,0,1).

Since any maximal surface can be given isothermal coordinates one can think of G as a map [formula], then the Gauss map G is given by G(τ) = σ(g(τ))). Next if we assume that the Gauss map for our maximal surface is one-one, then from above expression for G we deduce that g is one-one and g- 1 is holomorphic. Now set [formula]. Define [formula]. Then M(ζ)dζ = fdτ. Hence in this new variable ζ we can write Weierstrass-Enepper representation for a maximal surface using just one meromorphic function M(ζ)[\cite=kobasingu].

[formula]

The induced metric can be given in terms of the meromorphic function M as [\cite=kobamax]

[formula]

It has been known that the Born-Infeld equation

[formula]

is related to the minimal surface equation

[formula]

via a wick rotation in second variable `y', i.e., if we replace y by iy in [\eqref=bie] we get [\eqref=minse]. This fact has been exploited by Dey [\cite=rukmini] in deriving Weirstrass- Enneper representation for minimal surfaces in Euclidean space, using Barbishov and Chernikov's technique[\cite=barbi]. Whitham also explains this technique in his book [\cite=whitham].

Here we observe that if instead of second variable, if we make a wick rotation in first variable `x', i.e., replacing x by ix in [\eqref=bie] we get the maximal surface equation [\eqref=maxse] and vice-versa. We use this fact to obtain W-E representation for maximal surfaces.

The paper is organised as follows: First we have obtained the Weierstrass-Enneper representation in a system of isothermal coordinates (ζ1,ζ2) where ζ  =  ζ1 + iζ2. As a consequence of this we get to know the single Weierstrass data which determines the maximal surface. Then we will write Weierstrass-Enneper representation in a new coordinate system (ρ,) where ρ  =  ρ1 + iρ2. We call this new coordinate system as Hodographic coordinate system. We also give examples of maximal surfaces in hodographic coordinates. Then we construct a one parameter family of isometric maximal surfaces. This new coordinate system is interesting because we see that the φ gets separated into the variables (ζ,) or (ρ,), which was not the case in old coordinates (x,y).

Weierstrass-Enneper Representation

We begin with the complex coordinates

[formula]

[formula]

The partial differentials in this new coordinates (,) will be related to partial differentials in the old coordinates (x,y) by the following relations

[formula]   ,    [formula]   ,    [formula]   and

[formula]. These identities will reduce maximal surface equation [\ref=maxse] to

[formula]

Next we can interchange the role of independent and dependent variables. i.e.

(ũ,ṽ)  ↔  (,)

Since we are only considering those maximal graphs whose Gauss map is one-one, and hence the Gaussian curvature [formula]. Also [formula] as φ2x  +  φ2y < 1. Therefore,

[formula].

Then

[formula]   ,    [formula]   ,    [formula]   ,    [formula]

will reduce equations [\ref=mse]

[formula]

Now if we use the relations [\ref=co] in [\ref=mse1], we get

[formula]

or,

[formula]

Differentiating equation [\ref=mse2] w.r.t u, we get a second order quasilinear pde

v2ξvv - (1 - 2uv)ξuv + u2ξuu =  - 2uξu - 2vξv

Now assuming that the solutions which we want to find is in hyperbolic regime , we will find the characteristics for the above equation, they are integral curves of the following differential form

u2dv2 + (1 - 2uv)dudv + v2du2 = 0.

Characteristic curves are

[formula]

Now if we introduce

[formula]

as new variables to replace u and v. From this we can see we have

[formula]

Equations [\eqref=mse3] is equivalent to a single equation

ζ2ζ - zζ = 0.

Since [formula] we get

[formula]

Using above values of zζ and ζ, we get

ζ2ζ - zζ = v2zv - (1 - 2uv)zu + u2zv,

this shows [\eqref=mse3] is equivalent to

ζ2ζ - zζ = 0.

Any maximal surface whose Gauss map is one-one will have a local Weierstrass-Enneper type representation of the following form

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where M(ζ) is, a meromorphic function, known as the Weierstrass data.

Observe that φ  →    -  φ is a symmetry of the equation [\ref=maxse] if one keeps x and y invariant. Thus [formula] is also an acceptable representation.

From above lemma, we have ζ2ζ - zζ = 0. This will imply

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Now lemma also imply

[formula]

.

Therefore, Next, we have

φζ  =  φi(i)ζ  +  φiz(iz)ζ = (u + vζ2)F'(ζ) = ζF'(ζ).

Similarly,

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Let F'(ω) = M(ω). By expanding z into its real and imaginary parts, also using [formula] we get

[formula]

[formula]

[formula].

Hodographic coordinates

If F'(ζ)  ≠  0. Then let [formula] and F(ζ) = ρ, so that we can regard ρ and [formula] as new variables, at least locally. Now in this new coordinate system ρ, the Weiersrtass-Enneper representation attains the following form

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

From (3.3) we have

[formula]

Now in terms of φρ and [formula] equations (3.1) to (3.3) reduces to

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Now if we write ρ  =  ρ1 + iρ2. Then one can easily check that ρ1 and ρ2 are isothermal i.e.

|Xρ1|L  =  |Xρ2|L and 〈Xρ1,Xρ2〉L = 0

where X = (x,y,φ) and 〈,〉L is the Lorentzian norm. Next since this coordinate system ρ is related to the coordinate system ζ by a holomorphic map F. We conclude that the coordinate system ζ  =  ζ1 + iζ2 is also isothermal. Also the expression for unit normal to the maximal surface depends only on φρ, as we have

[formula].

Examples

Lorentzian Catenoid:[\cite=kobamax] Consider

[formula]

which is a maximal surface in the Lorentz-Minkowski space whose Gauss map is one-one. Then

[formula]

Recall [\eqref=co] and [\eqref=uv], we get

[formula]

Next we have

[formula]

we will use this equation to obtain z in terms of ζ and then from this we get to know the single holomorphic function F(ζ). Squaring both the sides of equation [\eqref=e1] and using the relations [\eqref=zz] in between, we get

[formula]

taking positive square root

[formula]

Comparing this with [\eqref=zF], we obtain [formula], so we have [formula] Therefore we can compute the Weierstrass data as [formula]. Now φ(ζ,) can be computed by the formula [\eqref=phiF]. Infact

[formula]

[formula]

This is W-E representation in terms of the coordinates [formula]. Next we will write (x,y,φ) in terms of hodographic coordinates [formula] [\eqref=hodo].

[formula]

[formula]

Lorentzian Helicoid[\cite=kobamax]: Consider

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Again we have

[formula]

Using relations [\eqref=uv], [\eqref=zF] and [\eqref=iz], we found

[formula]

and hence Weierstrass data [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

[formula]

Now we will write (x,y,φ) in terms of hodographic coordinates ρ and [formula].

[formula]

[formula]

One parameter family of isometric maximal surfaces

In the previous section of examples we have also computed the Weierstrass data [formula] for Lorentzian catenoid and [formula] for Lorentzian helicoid. Now if we define [formula] θ, such that [formula]

[formula]

then Mθ(ζ) becomes the Weierstrass data for a maximal surface which can be obtained using Theorem [\ref=thm]. In particular, when θ = 0,M0(ζ) = Mc(ζ), we get back Lorentzian catenoid and when [formula], [formula], we get the Lorentzian helicoid. Now we recall the expression for the metric [\eqref=metric], here we see that the metric depends only on the modulus of Weierstrass data M(ζ), so if we replace M(ζ) by eiθM(ζ) in the expression of the metric, the form of the metric remains unchanged because |M(ζ)| = |eiθM(ζ)|. This tells us that by varying θ, we get a one parameter family of isometric maximal surfaces in Lorentz-Minkowski space. In general, if one starts with a Weierstrass data for a given maximal surface, one can construct a one parameter family of isometric maximal surfaces, by following the procedure described in previous paragraph, starting from the given surface.
