Eigenvalue estimates for a class of elliptic differential operators in divergence form

Introduction

The Dirichlet problem for the Laplacian operator in a domain [formula] is the following

[formula]

The constant λ that satisfies [\eqref=introPD] is the eigenvalue and the corresponding solution u∈C2(Ω) is the eigenfunction. The existence of solutions for [\eqref=introPD] is known as the "membrane problem". A fixed membrane can be thought of as the skin of a drum. As we drum, the skin vibrates with frequencies which are precisely the eigenvalues of the Laplacian. It is also important to notice that the eigenvalues depend on the shape, material of the membrane, etc.

Eigenvalues of differential operators find their applications in many areas. For instance, in quantum mechanics quantities like energy, momentum and position are represented by hermitian operators in a Hilbert space. The eigenvalues of the operator that corresponds to the energy are interpreted as the possible values of energy that the system can attain. In addition, the gap between them is simply the gap between the energy levels.

In 1911, Weyl studied problem [\eqref=introPD] being the first to publish a proof of the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on domains in [formula] [\cite=Weyl]. However, Rayleigh had already studied such behavior few years earlier which had actually been conjectured by Sommerfeld and Lorentz. The Weyl's asymptotic formula is given by

[formula]

where ωn is the volume of the unit ball in [formula]. The discovery of Weyl has become an important tool for comparison of estimates related to eigenvalues, not only for the Laplacian operator, but also for the more general elliptic operators. Furthermore, the domains in [formula] could be replaced by domains in Riemannian manifolds.

We note that from the Weyl's asymptotic formula we can obtain

[formula]

and

[formula]

Good estimates are those that provide the best bounds taking into account the relations [\eqref=introd-weyl-c3], [\eqref=introd-limlambda-c3] and [\eqref=introd-limlambdaquadrado-c3].

These latter relations brought about the universal inequalities for the Laplacian operator in domains of [formula]. One example is the Payne-P�lya-Weinberger inequality [\cite=PPW] [\cite=PPW-1]. Payne, P�lya and Weinberger introduced the test-function method and proved

[formula]

Hile and Protter [\cite=Hile-Protter] improved inequality [\eqref=introd-I1-c3] as follows Further, Yang [\cite=Yang] obtained the Yang's first inequality and Yang's second inequality Moreover, he obtained

[formula]

The Weyl's asymptotic formula ensures that the estimate obtained by Yang is better than the one of Payne-Pólya-Weinberger.

An alternative technique to estimate the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on domains in [formula] is the recursion formula of Cheng-Yang [\cite=Cheng-Yang]. Using this formula, Cheng and Yang obtained the following result for a domain Ω in [formula]

[formula]

where [formula] is a constant. Again, the Weyl's asymptotic formula ensures that this bound is the best possible with respect to [formula].

Another inequality involving the eigenvalues of Laplacian for the Dirichlet problem was conjectured by Pólya. In a domain [formula] he proposed the inequality for [formula]. This inequality is known as the Pólya's conjecture. In relation to this conjecture, Li and Yau [\cite=Li-Yau] proved to be valid the inequality

[formula]

Let us now consider the Laplacian operator on a compact Riemannian manifold M with boundary. Cheng and Yang [\cite=Cheng-Yang-I] studied the Dirichlet problem in this case and proved an inequality of a more general form. They obtained

[formula]

where Λ1i  =  λk + 1  -  λi, [formula] and ui is an eigenfunction of the eigenvalue λi. Applying [\eqref=introd-I11-c3] in a domain Ω of a complete Riemannian manifold Mn and using Nash's Theorem [\cite=Nash], Chen and Cheng [\cite=chen-cheng] obtained the following generalisation of the Yang's first inequality

[formula]

and a generalisation of the Yang's second inequality where [formula] and [formula] is the norm of the mean curvature vector of the immersion of Mn into [formula]. Furthermore, using the recursion formula of Cheng-Yang, they obtained where (n,k) is constant.

Cheng and Yang [\cite=Cheng-Yang-III] employed the recursion formula and found a relation for the first k eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator defined in a bounded domain of a n-dimensional Riemannian manifold isometrically immersed in a Euclidean space. Namely,

[formula]

Let [formula] be the drifting Laplacian operator (also called η-Laplacian, since [formula]). Xia and Xu [\cite=Xia-Xu] generalised [\eqref=introd-I11-c3] for the drifting Laplacian as

[formula]

where Λ1i  =  λk + 1  -  λi and [formula]. They also considered a domain Ω of a complete Riemannian manifold M isometrically immersed in a Euclidean space to prove that

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]

In this paper we consider Ω to be a domain of a complete Riemannian manifold M and T a symmetric positive definite (1,1)-tensor on M in order to study the eigenvalue problem with Dirichlet condition on boundary where

[formula]

The main results of this paper are the following.

Let Ω be a domain in an n-dimensional complete Riemannian manifold M isometrically immersed in [formula], λi be the i-th eigenvalue of [formula] with eigenfunction ui. Then where Λ1i  =  λk + 1  -  λi, [formula], Aek is the Weingarten operator of the immersion in the direction ek, [formula], [formula] and [formula].

Let Ω be a domain in an n-dimensional complete Riemannian manifold M isometrically immersed in [formula] with mean curvature H and λi be the i-th eigenvalue of the drifting Laplacian operator. Then

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and [formula] are constants.

By setting [formula] we readily observe that inequality [\eqref=Ineq-introd-propCYM-c3] is equivalent to

[formula]

which has exactly the same form as the first Yang's inequality. Bearing in mind this observation we obtain the following corollaries of Theorem [\ref=propCYM-c3]. Firstly, we derive three inequalities that extend the results of Cheng and Yang obtained for a domain in the unit sphere [formula] and for a domain in the projective space [formula] [\cite=Cheng-Yang-II] [\cite=Cheng-Yang-I]. Secondly, we find a generalisation of the lower bound for the mean of the first k eigenvalues based on the Pólya's conjecture. Finally, we extend the estimate [\eqref=introd-tipoC-Y-c3] that give us an upper bound for the k-th eigenvalue of the drifting Laplacian operator.

Motivating the definition of the operator [formula]

In this section we will establish the tools necessary to work with the operator defined in [\eqref=defLintro] which enable us to obtain much more general results. We believe that this operator would also be useful in obtaining rigidity results or characterizing some known geometric objects.

Given a Riemannian manifold, to each [formula] we associate the (0,1)-tensor [formula], given by

It will also be convenient to consider the musical isomorphism [formula], that is, the inverse of the canonical mapping [formula].

In this paper we will be constantly using the identification of a (0,2)-tensor T with its associated (1,1)-tensor by the equation In particular, the metric tensor 〈,〉 will be identified with the (1,1)-tensor of the identity I in [formula]

Let [formula] be an orthonormal basis in TpM and S be a (1,1)-tensor with adjoint S*. Recall that the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product is given by

The divergence of a (1,1)-tensor T in (M,〈,〉) is defined as the (0,1)-tensor where p∈M, v,w∈TpM, [formula] stands for the covariant derivative of T and [formula] is the trace calculated in the metric 〈,〉.

Furthermore, we note that the Riemannian metric on M induces the metric where X,Y∈TpM and [formula]. We easily compute that

[formula]

When there is no danger of confusion we shall omit the symbol " [formula] " for the sake of simplicity.

For any vector field [formula] we can consider the (1,1)-tensor [formula] given by [formula], for all [formula]. In this way, the divergence of X is given by [formula] We will fix a function η∈C∞(M), to define the η-divergence of X as follows It is immediate from the usual properties of divergence of vector fields that, for all f∈C∞(M) we have

Suppose that (M,〈,〉) is an oriented Riemannian manifold, and let [formula] denote its Riemannian volume form. We use the weighted measures [formula] and [formula]. If ν is the outward normal vector field on the boundary ∂M and X is a tangent vector field with compact support on M, then which is the expression of the divergence theorem (or Stokes theorem) for the weighted manifolds [formula]. Note that the η-Laplacian operator L is given by for all f∈C∞(M). It is immediate that L satisfies analogous properties to those of the Laplacian. For instance, for [formula] we have and an extension of the well-known Bochner formula where [formula] is the Bakry-Emery-Ricci tensor. This tensor have been especially studied in the theory of solitons and almost Ricci solitons, since a gradient Ricci soliton [formula] is characterized by Ricη  =  λ〈,〉 for some constant λ, while in the case of almost gradient Ricci soliton, λ is a real smooth function in M.

Now let us consider a operator which is an extension of η-Laplacian.

Let T be a symmetric positive definite (1,1)-tensor in (M,〈,〉) and η∈C∞(M). We define the (η,T)-divergence operator by for all f∈C∞(M).

It is immediate from the properties of [formula] and the symmetry of T that for [formula]. Moreover, we define the η-divergence of T by

Alencar, Neto and Zhou [\cite=AGD] have recently proved a new Bochner-type formula and applied it to the operator which was introduced by Cheng and Yau [\cite=Cheng-Yau], namely

[formula]

where f∈C∞(M) and T is a symmetric (1,1)-tensor. Such formula is given by

[formula]

where [formula] and R is the curvature tensor of M.

A straightforward computation gives us

[formula]

where T is symmetric (0,2)-tensor and η,f,h are real smooth functions on M.

From [\eqref=C7-c3] we get the next equation

[formula]

We point out that equation [\eqref=rel_L_dv_Box-c3] relates the operators [formula], [formula] and [formula]. It also gives us a Bochner-type formula for the operator [formula] on Riemannian manifold, namely: where [formula].

Indeed, from equation [\eqref=rel_L_dv_Box-c3] we can deduce

[formula]

that is, Therefore, our assertion follows from Bochner-type formula [\eqref=BFpQ].

Having proven the Bochner-type formula for [formula], it is now most natural to study hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature k by means of the properties of the operator [formula] as well as to obtain some generalizations in the spirit of Lichnerowicz's and Obata's theorems. Using the same technique one can even hope to generalize the recent results obtained by Alencar, Neto and Zhou [\cite=AGD]. Furthermore, we can also obtain some generalizations of the work of Uhlenbeck [\cite=Uhlenbeck], Berger [\cite=berger] and Soulf and Ilias [\cite=ahmad].

For orientable compact Riemannian manifolds, Cheng and Yau proved that the operator [formula] is self-adjoint if and only if [formula]. An alternative proof of this fact follows from equation [\eqref=C7-c3]. Indeed, from this equation and the divergence theorem, we get for all f,h∈C∞(M). Hence, the operator [formula] is self-adjoint if and only if [formula]. In particular, equation [\eqref=rel_L_dv_Box-c3] reduces to

For instance, denoting [formula], it is well-known that [formula] and [formula], so the tensor [formula] has null divergence, and therefore [formula] is self-adjoint. Then,

The Dirichlet problem

In what follows (M,〈,〉) is a complete Riemannian manifold and the domain Ω  ⊂  M is connected, bounded and open. We observe that the divergence theorem remains true in the form [formula], where [formula] is the weight volume form on the boundary ∂Ω induced by the outward normal vector ν on ∂Ω. Thus, the integrate by parts formula is for all [formula]. Therefore, [formula] is self-adjoint in the space of all functions in [formula] that vanish in ∂Ω. Thus the eigenvalue problem

[formula]

has a real and discrete spectrum [formula], where each λi is repeated according to its multiplicity. In particular, for an eigenfunctions ui we have

[formula]

Operators in divergence form have already been studied in different settings [\cite=AJuR] [\cite=Li_Ma] [\cite=Setti]. For instance, for T = I the operator [formula] is the η-Laplacian, it is closely related to eigenvalues problems in spaces with warped product [\cite=CM04] [\cite=Ma06]. For example, when [formula], we consider the metric g = g0 + e-  ηdθ2 on the product [formula], where g0 stands for the Riemannian metric in the domain Ω, while dθ2 is the canonical metric of [formula], then the scalar curvature of the metric g is given by [formula]. We mention that the modified scalar curvature of a metric g and a dilatation function η, as introduced by Perelman, is [formula], where [formula] is the scalar curvature of g.

The Weyl's asymptotic expansion [\eqref=introd-weyl-c3] and its immediate consequences [\eqref=introd-limlambda-c3] and [\eqref=introd-limlambdaquadrado-c3] will be of paramount importance to obtaining our estimates. An immediate implication of [\eqref=introd-limlambda-c3] is that and from [\eqref=introd-I1-c3] we obtain Analogous reasoning allows us to deduce from [\eqref=introd-limlambda-c3], [\eqref=introd-limlambdaquadrado-c3] and [\eqref=introd-I6-c3] that Therefore, the estimate [\eqref=introd-I6-c3] is better than [\eqref=introd-I1-c3].

In Section [\ref=sec-eta-laplaciano] we will make extensions of [\eqref=introd-tipoC-Y-c3] and [\eqref=introd-media-c3] for the particular case when [formula] is the η-Laplacian.

Now we start with the proofs of principal results. Firstly, we will demonstrate the proposition below which extends [\eqref=introd-I11-c3] and [\eqref=introd-I12-c3] for [formula]. For this, we assume that the eigenfunctions associated to the problem [\eqref=PD-c3] are orthonormal in [formula]

Let λi be the i-th eigenvalue of Problem [\eqref=PD-c3] and ui its corresponding eigenfunction. Then, for [formula], and k integer, is valid

By the inequality of Rayleigh-Ritz, we have

[formula]

for any no null function [formula] satisfying For [formula] and for each i, we consider

[formula]

where [formula], so that, φi|∂Ω = 0 and Then, we can make ψ  =  φi in [\eqref=IneqRR], i.e.,

[formula]

Since from [\eqref=phi-i] we have

[formula]

Plugging [\eqref=-fiLfi-c3] in [\eqref=RRfi-c3], we deduce that Hence

[formula]

where [formula]. Now, we will estimate To do this, we set Again we use that [formula] to write

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

From [\eqref=1.0-c3], (λk + 1  -  λi)|φi|2  ≤  Pi, then [\eqref=Pi-c3] implies whence

[formula]

Moreover

[formula]

thus On the other hand,

[formula]

and

[formula]

Substituting [\eqref=1.2-c3] and [\eqref=1.3-c3] into [\eqref=1.1_dif-c3] we obtain

[formula]

We observe that

[formula]

since [formula]. Finally, the required equation in the proposition follows immediately from [\eqref=eqFAuf1] and [\eqref=eqFAuf2].

The next result allow us to extend [\eqref=Chen-Cheng-1a.Y-c3] and [\eqref=introd-I13-c3] for the operator [formula].

Let Ω be a domain of an n-dimensional complete Riemannian manifold M isometrically immersed in [formula], λi be the i-th eigenvalue of Problem [\eqref=PD-c3] and ui be the eigenfunction corresponding to λi. Let α be the second fundamental form of M and [formula], then

[formula]

where Λ1i  =  λk + 1  -  λi.

Let [formula] be the position vector of the immersion of M in [formula]. Consider [formula] in Proposition [\ref=Lem1T-c3] and take the sum in [formula]. We have

[formula]

So,

[formula]

Denoting the canonical connection of [formula] by [formula] and taking [formula] a local orthonormal geodesic frame in p∈M adapted to M, we can write

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

and

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

In this way we have

[formula]

differentiating we obtain

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Since T is symmetric we have 〈T(ej),ei〉  =  〈ej,T(ei)〉, which implies and substituting into [\eqref=divT-c3] we have

[formula]

where On the other hand,

[formula]

Substituting [\eqref=2-Tr] and [\eqref=d_etaT-c3] into [\eqref=06T-c3], we obtain Now we compute

[formula]

and

[formula]

Substituting [\eqref=03T-c3], [\eqref=02T-c3], [\eqref=09T-c3] and [\eqref=08T-c3] into [\eqref=01T-c3] we complete the proof of the lemma.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=propCYT-c3]

We make use of Lemma [\ref=lemmaCYT-c3]. Firstly, we observe that

[formula]

We have

[formula]

so, for [formula] and [formula]

[formula]

Further, for [formula] we have

[formula]

We also have

[formula]

Estimating the right hand side we get

[formula]

where [formula], and each Aek is the Weingarten operator of the immersion in the direction ek. We must notice that the tensor character of the Weingarten operator and the orientation of M allow us to assume that {ek}, [formula] is a global orthonormal frame of normal vectors to M.

To complete the proof we need to estimate

[formula]

and

[formula]

Replacing [\eqref=Tnabla-eta-c3], [\eqref=Tintegral01-c3], [\eqref=Tintegral04-c3], [\eqref=Tintegral02-c3] and [\eqref=Tintegral03-c3] into Lemma [\ref=lemmaCYT-c3] we complete the proof of the theorem.

Aplications to η-Laplacian operator

In this section, we apply the results of the last section to obtain an upper bound for the eigenvalues from the problem [\eqref=PD-c3] in the case T = I, that is, when the operator [formula] is the η-Laplacian.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=propCYM-c3]

From Lemma [\ref=lemmaCYT-c3], for T = I we can write

[formula]

So, for [formula] and [formula] we have

[formula]

But

[formula]

where [formula]. The conclusion of the theorem follows immediately by replacing [\eqref=alambda_i+b-c3] into [\eqref=aux-alambda_i+b-c3].

We observe that in the case of the existence of a family of isometric immersions preserving the mean H, we get the same inequalities involving eigenvalues for all manifolds. For example, the family of isometric immersions that transforms catenoid in helicoid.

We present below some inequalities that are consequences of Theorem [\ref=propCYM-c3].

Under the assumption of Theorem [\ref=propCYM-c3] we have the following equations

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

From [\eqref=formCYM-c3] we can write thus We affirm that

[formula]

for all [formula]. Indeed, otherwise there would be i0 such that which would imply and would contradict inequality [\eqref=formCYM-c3]. Summing up the terms on the right hand side of [\eqref=etak+1<etai-c3] we derive which proves [\eqref=cor.ineq1-c3]. To prove [\eqref=cor.ineq2-c3], we note that [\eqref=formCYM-c3] is equivalent to then we can say that the discriminant of P(υk + 1) satisfy

[formula]

Since P(υk + 1)  ≤  0 we have rηk + 1  ≤  υk + 1  ≤  Rηk + 1, where rηk + 1 and Rηk + 1 are the smaller and the biggest root of P, respectively. Then

[formula]

Substituting [\eqref=discriminante-c3] into [\eqref=ineq_Baskara-c3] we obtain

[formula]

or equivalently

[formula]

so Finally, as [\eqref=formCYM-c3] is true for all k, it follows that that is, we can observe again that the polynomial P(υk)  ≤  0. Analogously we have

[formula]

Hence from [\eqref=cor.ineq2-c3] and [\eqref=cor-eta_k-c3] we obtain [\eqref=cor.ineq3-c3].

We note that [\eqref=cor.ineq1-c3] is a second-Yang type inequality and [\eqref=cor.ineq3-c3] generalizes [\eqref=introd-I6-c3]. We also obtain the following lower bound for sums of the first k eigenvalues, which extends inequality [\eqref=CY-Laplaciano].

Under the assumption of Theorem [\ref=propCYM-c3] we have

Using inequality [\eqref=formCYM-c3] and Lemma [\ref=lemA-c3] we obtain that is, More generally,

[formula]

for any positive integer l. Furthermore, by Lemma [\ref=lemA-c3] we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

On the other hand, the Weyl's asymptotic formula says that

[formula]

and

[formula]

then [\eqref=limlambda] implies

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

Analogously, from [\eqref=limlambdaquadrado] we get

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Thus, from [\eqref=limetaquadrado1], [\eqref=limeta] and [\eqref=limetaquadrado] we obtain

[formula]

Finally, from [\eqref=Fk+l-c3], [\eqref=2.70-1-c3] and [\eqref=limetaquadrado1o] we conclude, for any positive integer k, that is,

The next result extends the estimate [\eqref=introd-tipoC-Y-c3] for the η-Laplacian operator. It is immediate from [\eqref=formCYM-c3] and Lemma [\ref=CorCYM-c3].

Under the assumption of Theorem [\ref=propCYM-c3] we have

We point out that the previous inequality agrees with the Weyl's asymptotic formula.
