Quartic Equations with Trivial Solutions over Gaussian Integers

Introduction

Quartic equations of the form aX4 + bX2Y2 + cY4 = dZ2 have a rich past and were research topics to many famous names: P. Fermat, L. Euler, A. Legendre and J. Lagrange. However, their results concerned only equations over the rational integers [formula].

In a closer past, D. Hilbert, A.Aigner, T. Nagell, L.J. Mordell, B.N. Delone, D.K. Faddeev had undertaken the challenge of studying the algebraic equations over some abelian algebraic extensions of [formula] and even ventured into generalizing the problem to having algebraic integers as coefficients.

The present work is structured as follows. First, there is a discussion of various preliminary results needed to build the future resolvent theory for the quartic equations. For quartic equations, the resolvent is a system of equations of second-degree which is algebraically obtained from the original diophantine equation [\cite=Sidokhine:2013ab]. The concept of resolvents is introduced and various specific quartic equations of the form aX4 + bX2Y2 + cY4 = dZ2 are studied over [formula].

The present work itself is a genuinely original approach to the problem of the quartic equations with only trivial solutions, and is only related to other publications on this topic in terms of results but not in terms of methodology.

The Infinite Descent Hypothesis for the Rings with Unique Factorization

A ring R is a unique factorization domain (UFD) if:

R is a domain,

any irreducible element of R is also a prime element,

for any a belonging to R takes place a = up1p2...pm where u belongs to unit group U and pi belong to a set primes π of R not all pi are necessary distinct, and this representation is unique up to permutations and associates.

On Decomposing of the Ring with Unique Factorization into Disjoint Cosets

An invariant characteristic an element of R is the number of prime divisors contained in its representation including multiplicities. This characteristic for any a∈R will be denoted ν(a). In practice, ν is interpreted as a map [formula]. The mapping is built as follows:

[formula] , where p∈π, acts on any element a of R as follows: νp(a) = α,pα||a. For any p, νp(a) = 0 if [formula] (i.e. [formula]).

[formula], ν acts on any element a∈R as follows: [formula].

[formula] consists of only a finite number of terms due to R being UFD. Let us notice some important properties of the mapping ν:

ν(a)  =  0 ↔   a belongs to unit group

ν(a)  =  1 ↔   a belongs to π

ν(ab)  =  ν(a)  +  ν(b)

if a|b and [formula] →   ν(a)  <  ν(b).

R /  ker (ν) = {An}, An  =  {a∈R|ν(a) = n} and if n  ≠  m then [formula].

Proposition 2.4 is a direct consequence of unique factorization.

Furthermore, define a binary operation μ:R /  ker (ν)  ×  R /  ker (ν)  →  R /  ker (ν) as follows: μ(An,Am) = Aν(xy)  =  An + m where x∈An,y∈Am. The fact that μ is well-defined is again a consequence of unique factorization. Defines multiplication on the partition R /  ker (ν) making it into a monoid.

(R /  ker (ν),μ) is a monoid.

Since μ(An,Am) is simple denoted An  ·  Am let us use that notation instead. For any n,m and k takes place (An  ·  Am)  ·  Ak  =  An  ·  (Am  ·  Ak) There exists an identity element, A0 such that for any n, An  ·  A0  =  A0  ·  An  =  An.

R /  ker (ν) has a well - ordering generated by ν.

Since ordering (or well - ordering for that matter) is a binary relation defined on the elements of A /  ker (ν)  ×  A /  ker (ν) this simple construction. Let a∈An and a'∈Am. Define: An  <  Am if ν(a)  <  ν(a'). Since ν is well defined this definition does not depended on which element we chose from An and Am. This is a natural ordering of R /  ker (ν).

The cosets of R /  ker (ν) are well-ordered and hence can now be subject to infinite descent. The only additional requirement is a definition of true (and by negation false) statements on cosets.

The Principle of Infinite Descent for Cosets

Given a statement T defined on any element from An then T(An) is true if and only if for any element a'∈An the statement T(a') is true. T(An) is false if there exists a''∈An such that T(a'') is false.

Since the cosets are well ordered we can now formulate the infinite descent hypothesis:

Let T be a class statement and T(A1),...,T(An) are all true. Suppose now that T(An + 1) is false. If it will follow that from T(An + 1) being false will imply that one of the T(Ak) with k < n + 1 is also false we have a contradiction and T(An + 1) must have be true.

The Quartic Equations aX4 + bX2Y2 + cY4 = dZ2 over Gaussian Integers

The Equation X4 + Y4 = Z2 (Fermat - Hilbert)

The equation X4 + Y4 = Z2, where gcd (X,Y,Z)∈U and XYZ  ≠  0, has no non-trivial solutions over Gaussian integers.

Let (α,β,γ) be some solution of the equation then ν(β)  ≥  3. Thus the equation has no solution if β belongs to A0,A1,A2. Let An + 1 be the first when (α,β,γ) is any solution the equation where β belongs to An + 1. Let α,γ belong to OI, and β = (1 + i)2 + mpα22...pαnn, where pi are distinct primes and belong to OI (see [\cite=Sidokhine:2016aa]). Then, according to [\cite=Sidokhine:2016aa], [formula]. Thus P' = P2,Q' = Q2 where P or Q belongs to OI.

Let t  =  0 then α2 = i(P4 - Q4). Since α is odd, gcd (P,Q)  =  1 and [formula] we can suppose that P,Q are odd and even respectively. Then R(α2) + I(P4) - I(Q4) = 0. Thus [formula] but since α∈OI we have [formula]. That is a contradiction.

Let t  =  1 then α2 =  - (P4 + Q4) and R(α2) + R(P4) + R(Q4)  =  0. Then [formula] as α∈OI so [formula]. That is a contradiction.

Let t  =  2 according to case t  =  0, [formula] but [formula]. That is a contradiction.

Let t  =  3 then P4 + Q4  =  α2. Thus (α',β',γ') where α'  =  P,β'  =  Q,γ'  =  α is the solution of given equation X4 + Y4 = Z2 where β' is a proper divisor of β so ν(β') < ν(β). Thus β' belongs to Ak < An + 1. That is a contradiction.

Thus the equation X4 + Y4 = Z2 has no non-trivial solutions over [formula].

The Equations X4 + iY2 = Z4 ; X4 + Y4 = iZ2 (Szabó - Najman)

The equation X4 + iY2 = Z4 where gcd (X,Y,Z)∈U and XYZ  ≠  0, has no non-trivial solutions over Gaussian integers.

Let (α,β,γ) be a solution of the equation. Let α,γ belong to OI, and β = (1 + i)2 + mpα22...pαnn, where pi are distinct primes and belong to OI be a solution of the equation [\cite=Sidokhine:2016aa], we have α2 = i1 - t(P2 - ( - 1)tiQ2),β = (1 + i)2PQ,γ2 = i1 - t(P2 + ( - 1)tiQ2).

Let t  =  0 or 2 then α2 = i(P2 - iQ2),γ2 = i(P2 + iQ2) or α2 =  - i(P2 - iQ2),γ2 =  - i(P2 + iQ2) where [formula] and P or Q belongs to OI. Thus α2 = iP2 + Q2,γ2 = iP2 - Q2.

The equation X4 + iY2  +  Z4 = 0, according to [\cite=Sidokhine:2016aa], for the first equality [formula], for the second equality [formula] and [formula]. That is a contradiction.

Let t  =  1,3 then we have α2  =  P2 + iQ2,γ2  =  P2 - iQ2, or α2 =  - P2 - iQ2,γ2 =  - P2 + iQ2. Thus we have (αγ)2 = P4 + Q4. This equality is impossible according to theorem 3.1. Thus the equation X4 + iY2 = Z4 has no non-trivial solutions over [formula].

The equation X4 + Y4 = iZ2, where gcd (X,Y,Z)∈U and XYZ  ≠  0, has only the finite number of non-trivial solutions.

Let (α,β,γ) be a solution of the equation then ν(β)  ≥  3. The equation has no solution if γ belongs to A0,A1,A2. Let An + 1 be the first when (α,β,γ) is a solution the equation, where γ∈An + 1. According to [\cite=Sidokhine:2016aa], α,β∈OI, γ = im(1 + i)pα22...pαnn, where m is equal 0 or 1 and pi are distinct primes and belong to OI. Then, according to [\cite=Sidokhine:2016aa], where P,Q belong to OI and gcd (P,Q)  =  1. Let us show that for t is possible value only 0. Indeed according to the study of the equation X2 + iY2 + (1 + i)Z2  =  0, [\cite=Sidokhine:2016aa] , we have

Let t = 0 then (1 + i)α2 = P2 - iQ2,(1 + i)β2 = iP2 - Q2 that it is impossible.

Let t = 0 then (1 + i)α2 = P2 + iQ2,(1 + i)β2 = iP2 + Q2 that it is possible.

Let t = 1 then (1 + i)α2 = iP2  ∓  Q2,(1 + i)β2 =  - P2  ±  iQ2 that it is impossible.

Let t = 2 then (1 + i)α2 =  - P2  ±  iQ2,(1 + i)β2 =  - iP2  ∓  Q2 that it is impossible.

Let t = 3 then (1 + i)α2 =  - iP2  ∓  Q2,(1 + i)β2 =  - P2  ∓  iQ2 that it is impossible.

Thus we have the following system of equalities Then αβ,P,Q satisfy the following equality where α,β,P,Q belong to OI and gcd (P,Q)  =  1. So we can write the following equality where [formula] and [formula]. Possible two cases:

Case 1: Let P2 - Q2  =  0 then (is,it,  ±  i(1 + i)) where 0  ≤  s,t  ≤  3 is the full set of solutions of the equation X4 + Y4 = iZ2.

Case 2: P2 - Q2  ≠  0 then equation X4 + Y4 = iZ2 has no solution. Indeed, let us consider the system of the equations

Notice. Since α,β,P,Q∈OI and gcd (α,β)  =   gcd (P,Q)  =  1. One can write the following equalities [formula], where u∈OI, and [formula] where l  =  0;1,v = (1 + i)2 + rw and w∈OI.

Thus we can write the equalities where

We take only up or down sings of the system equations. According to the study of the equation X2 + Y2 + Z2 = 0 [\cite=Sidokhine:2016aa] we have the following equalities

[formula]

where gcd (m,n)  =   gcd (m',n')  =  1, [formula] and m or n belong to OI and also and m' or n' belong to OI. Show that [formula]. Let [formula] then t  -  s  =  2k + 1 and or But then as We have a contradiction. Thus [formula] and we have Since (k,s) takes the values (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) they leads to the system of the equations

Let [formula] then n,n'∈OI since nm  =  n'm' and gcd (n,m)  =   gcd (n',m')  =  1.

Let (n,m,n',m') be a solution of the system of equations then [formula]. The system of equations has no solution if the product nm belongs to A0,A1,A2. Let An + 1 be the first when (n,m,n',m') is a solution the equation where nm∈An + 1.

Further we use the notation gcd (m,n)  =  (m,n). The following factorization is possible.

[formula]

Let us make substitution then we have Since gcd ((n,m'),(m,n'))  =   gcd ((n,n')2 + (m',m)2,(n,n')2 - (m',m)2)  =  1. Thus where [formula] or ±  i. However, the value k can not be equal to ( - 1) or (  ±  i). Since (n,n'),(n,m') and (n',m) belong to OI we have for case 1: but (n',n)2,  -  (n,m')2 must have the same sign. That is a contradiction. For case 2 we have But (n,m') must be even. That it is contradiction. Thus we have gotten the system of equalities where α'  =  (n,m'), γ' = (m,n'), P' = (n',n), Q'  =  (m',m) and Q' is a divisor of the product nm. The expressions for P',Q' of the first equality have the following form The expressions for P',Q' of the second equality have the following form Thus we have the following system of the equalities where (u,v,u',v') is a solution of the system of equations. Since the product uv is a proper divisor Q' so ν(uv)  <  ν(nm). Thus the product uv belongs to Ak < An + 1. That is a contradiction. Thus the equation X4 + Y4 = iZ2 has only a finite number of the non-trivial solutions over [formula].

The Equations X4 + (1 + i)Y2 = Z4; X4 + Y4 = (1 + i)Z2

The equation X4 + (1 + i)Y2 = Z4, where gcd (X,Y,Z)∈U and XYZ  ≠  0, has no non-trivial solutions over Gaussian integers.

Let (α,β,γ) be a solution of the equation then ν(β)  ≥  3. Thus the equation has no solution if to β∈A0,A1 or A2. Let An + 1 be the first when (α,β,γ) is a solution the equation, where β∈An + 1. Let α,γ belong to OI, and γ = i2 + m(1 + i)pα22...pαnn, where pi are distinct primes and belong to OI. Then, according to [\cite=Sidokhine:2016aa], we have Let t  =  0 then

Since α,γ,P belong to OI so (αγ)2, - P4 must have the same sign. That is a contradiction.

Let t  =  2 like t  =  0, (αγ)2, - P4 must have the same sign. That is a contradiction.

Let t  =  3 then α2  =   - (P2 + (1 + i)Q2),γ2  =   - (P2 - (1 + i)Q2).

Since α,P belong to OI so α2, - P2 must have the same sign. That is a contradiction.

Let t = 1 then we have the following system of equations According to [\cite=Sidokhine:2016aa], the individual solutions of each of the equations have the following forms

[formula]

where gcd (n,m)  =   gcd (n',m')  =  1 and n,n'∈OI. Show that [formula]. Let [formula] then s  -  t  =  2k + 1 and or But [formula] then as [formula]. That is a contradiction. Thus we have ( - 1)k(n2 - ( - 1)s(1 + i)m2) = n'2 + ( - 1)s(1 + i)m'2. Given result leads to the following system of the equations

where n,n'∈OI since [formula] and gcd (n,m)  =   gcd (n',m')  =  1.

Let (n,m,n',m') be a solution of the system of equations then ν(nm)  ≥  3. The system of equations has no solutions if the product nm belongs to A0,A1,A2. Let An + 1 be the first when (n,m,n',m') is any solution the equation where nm∈An + 1. Further we use the notation gcd (n,m)  =  (n,m). The following factorization is possible

[formula]

Let us make substitution then we have Since gcd ((n,m'),(m,n'))  =   gcd ((n,n')2 + (1 + i)(m',m)2,(n',n)2 - (1 + i)(m,m')2)  =  1. Thus where [formula] or ±  i. However, the value k cannot be equal to ( - 1) or ±  i. Since (n,n'),(n,m') and (n',m) belong to OI we have for case 1 but (n',n)2, - (n,m')2 must have the same sign. That is a contradiction. For case 2 we have According to [\cite=Sidokhine:2016aa], (m',m) has to belong to OI but [formula]. That is a contradiction. Thus we have gotten the following system of the equalities where P' = (n',n),Q'  =  (m',m),α'  =  (n,m'),γ' = (m,n') and Q' is a divisor of the product nm. The expressions for P',Q' of the first equality have the following form The expressions for P',Q' of the second equality have the following form Thus we have the following system of the equalities where (u,v,u',v') is a solution of the system of equations. Since the product uv is a proper divisor Q' so ν(uv)  <  ν(nm). Thus the product uv belongs to Ak < An + 1. That is a contradiction. Thus the equation X4 + (1 + i)Y2 = Z4 has no non-trivial solutions over [formula].

The equation X4 + Y4 = (1 + i)Z2, where gcd (X,Y,Z)∈U and XYZ  ≠  0, has no non-trivial solutions over Gaussian integers.

Since properties of solutions of the equation X2 + (1 + i)Y2 + Z2 = 0 are not compatible with solvability of the quartic equation so X4 + Y4 = (1 + i)Z2 has no solution over [formula].

The Equation X4 + 6X2Y2 + Y4 = Z2 (Mordell)

The equation X4 + 6X2Y2 + Y4 = Z2, where gcd (X,Y,Z)∈U and XYZ  ≠  0, has only the finite number of non-trivial solutions over Gaussian integers.

Let X,Y belong to G - submonoid in other words X  =  pα22...pαnn,Y = (1 + i)βpβ22...pβmm , where pi are distinct primes and belong to OI then we should consider two equations We study the case X4 + 6X2Y2 + Y4 = Z2 other case can be considered the same way.

The equation X4 + 6X2Y2 + Y4 = Z2, where gcd (X,Y,Z) = 1, [formula], XYZ  ≠  0 and X,Y∈G, has a solution if only if the system of the equations where U,V,U',V' belong to G-set, has a solution.

Let u0,v0,u0',v0' be a solution of the system of equations, where [formula] and u0,v0,u0',v0' belong to G - submonoid, then the equation has a solution over Gaussian integers and so the discriminate of this equation must be faithful square. In other words there exists d0 such that Let (u0,v0,d0) be a solution of the equation X4 + 6X2Y2 + Y4 = Z2, where gcd (u0,v0) = 1, [formula] and u0,v0,d0∈G then [formula], where u0',v0' are Gaussian integers and gcd (u0',v0')∈U. Since u0'v0'  =  (u0v0)2, where u0,v0∈G, we can write u0' = isn2, v0' = i- sm2, where n,m∈G, gcd (n,m) = 1, and nm = u0v0. According to [\cite=Sidokhine:2016aa], for s there are only two possible values 0,2 and we can write down the following equalities Since the system of equations of second - degree has no solution so the quartic equation also has no non-trivial solutions.

The equation X4 + 6X2Y2 + Y4 = Z2, where [formula] and X,Y∈G has only the finite number of non-trivial solutions over Gaussian integers.

Let [formula] and u0,v0∈G be a solution of equation. Let u20 + v20 = 0 then given equation has solutions [formula], where the choice of the signs is arbitrary, are all solutions of given equation. Let u20 + v20  ≠  0 then, according to [\cite=Sidokhine:2016aa], this equation has no solution.

According lemmas 3.7, 3.8, the equation X4 + 6X2Y2 + Y4 = Z2, where XYZ  ≠  0 and gcd (X,Y,Z)∈U and X,Y∈G has only the finite number of non-trivial solutions over [formula].

The Equation X4 + 6(1 + i)X2Y2 + 2iY4 = Z2

The equation X4 + 6(1 + i)X2Y2 + 2iY4 = Z2, where XYZ  ≠  0, [formula] and gcd (X,Y,Z)∈U, has no non-trivial solutions over Gaussian integers.

Let X,Y belong to G-submonoid in other words X = pα22...pαnn,Y = (1 + i)βpβ22...pβmm, where pi are distinct primes and belong to OI so we should consider two equations We study the case X4 + 6(1 + i)X2Y2 + 2iY4 = Z2 other case can be considered the same way.

The equation X4 + 6(1 + i)X2Y2 + 2iY4 = Z2 where [formula] and X,Y∈G, has a solution if only if the system of equations where U,V,U',V' belong to G-submonoid and [formula] has a solution.

Let u0,v0,u0',v0' be a solution of the system of equations and u0,v0,u0',v0' belong to G-submonoid then the equation has the solutions over Gaussian integers and so the discriminate of this equation must be faithful square. Other words there exists Gaussian integer d0 such that [formula] and u0,v0,d0∈G. Let (u0,v0,d0) be a solution of X4 + 6(1 + i)X2Y2 + 2iY4 = Z2, where u0,v0∈G, gcd (u0,v0) = 1,u0v0d0  ≠  0, then [formula],where u0',v0' are Gaussian integers and gcd (u0',v0')∈U. Since u0'v0' = (1 + i)(u0v0)2, where u0,v0∈G, we can write u0' = isn2,v0' = i- s(1 + i)m2, where n,m∈G, gcd (n,m) = 1, and nm = u0v0. According to [\cite=Sidokhine:2016aa], s can only be 0 or 2 and we can write down the following equalities

Since the system of equations has no solution so the quartic equation also has no non-trivial solutions.

According lemma 3.10 the equation X4 + 6(1 + i)X2Y2 + 2iY4 = Z2, where [formula] and X,Y∈G, has no non-trivial solutions over [formula].

Discussion and Conclusion

In our work we have represented the study on quartic equations aX4  +  bX2Y2  +  cY4  =  dZ2 over the ring of Gaussian integers by a method of the resolvents. By this method one has been gotten the proofs of the propositions both on new quartic equations: X4  +  6X2Y2  +  Y4  =  Z2 (Mordell's equation over Gaussian integers), X4  +  6(1 + i)X2Y2  +  2iY2  =  Z2, X4  ±  Y4  =  (1 + i)Z2 and the new proofs of the known theorems on the Fermat's quartic equations: X4  +  Y4  =  Z2 (Fermat - Hilbert), X4  ±  Y4  =  iZ2 (Szabó - Najman)[\cite=Szabo:2004aa].

For proving the propositions on the quartic equations over the ring [formula] one had been built a special form of the fundamental theorem arithmetic, modified Mordell's lemma with account of the properties of Gaussian integers and developed the infinite descent hypothesis for the rings with unique factorization. It has been shown that the results obtained are consistent with known results on Fermat's quartic equations which were proved by evaluating of the norms of Gaussian integers [\cite=Cross:1993aa] as well as by the elliptic curves [\cite=Najman:2010aa]. The given approach permits from the start to understand why some phenomenon in these problems as example the existence of the finite number of non-trivial solutions for some quartic equations takes place. General problem of a solvability of Fermat's quartic equations over imaginary quadratic rings (Aigner's problem) is one of the topical tasks, [\cite=Mordell:1969aa] and [\cite=Lynch:2014aa].
