Partial orthogonal spreads over [formula] invariant under the symmetric and alternating groups

Introduction

Let K be a finite field of characteristic 2, with |K| = q. Let V be a vector space of even dimension 2r over K. A quadratic form defined on V is a function Q:V  →  K that satisfies

[formula]

for all λ in K and all u and v in V. In this formula, f is an alternating bilinear form, called the polarization of Q. We say that Q is a non-degenerate quadratic form if f is a non-degenerate bilinear form.

We say that a vector v∈V is singular with respect to Q if Q(v) = 0. We say that a subspace U of V is totally isotropic with respect to f if f(u,w) = 0 for all u and w in U. We also say that U is totally singular with respect to Q if all the elements of U are singular. It should be clear that if U is totally singular with respect to Q, then it is totally isotropic with respect to f, but the converse is not necessarily true.

We shall assume henceforth that Q is non-degenerate. In this case, the maximum dimension of a totally singular subspace of V is r. We say that Q has index r if there is at least one r-dimensional totally singular subspace of V. We shall also assume henceforth that Q has index r.

We recall that an isometry of Q is a K-linear automorphism, σ, say, of V that satisfies

[formula]

for all v∈V. The set of all isometries of Q forms a group under composition, called the orthogonal group of Q. This group is determined up to isomorphism by stipulating, as we have done, that Q is non-degenerate and has index r. We denote this orthogonal group by O+2r(K), or O+2r(q).

We call a set of r-dimensional totally singular subspaces of V a partial orthogonal spread for V and Q if the subspaces intersect trivially in pairs. Since V contains precisely

[formula]

non-zero singular vectors, it follows that a partial orthogonal spread contains at most qr - 1 + 1 subspaces. We refer to a partial orthogonal spread of size qr - 1 + 1 as a complete orthogonal spread.

It is a non-trivial fact that V contains a complete orthogonal spread if and only if r is even. On the other hand, if r is odd, the maximum size of a partial orthogonal spread in V is two.

It is clear that if σ is an element of O+2r(K), and U is a totally singular subspace of V, σ(U) is also a totally singular subspace. Thus, O+2r(K) permutes the maximal (r-dimensional) totally singular subspaces, and it is known that this permutation action is transitive. It is a remarkable fact, proved by Kantor and Williams, that provided r is even, V has a complete orthogonal spread that consists of a regular orbit of a single maximal totally singular subspace under the action of a cyclic group of order qr - 1 + 1. See Theorem 6.5 and the proof of Theorem 3.3 (i) in [\cite=KW].

The main purpose of this paper is to construct a partial orthogonal spread of size 2m + 1 in V invariant under the action of the symmetric group Σ2m + 1, when dim V = 2m, m  ≥  3 is an integer, and [formula]. This enables us to prove the following result. Let G be a finite group with |G| = 2m + ε, where ε = 0 or 1. Then if m  ≥  3, G acts transitively and regularly on a partial orthogonal spread in V. We also show that the alternating group A9 acts in a natural manner on a complete spread of size 9 defined on a vector space of dimension 8 over [formula].

Modules for Σn in characteristic 2

The irreducible representations of the symmetric group Σn over a field of characteristic 2 may all be realized in [formula]. They are labelled by partitions of n where no two parts are equal (so-called 2-regular partitions). We let Dλ denote the irreducible [formula]-module labelled by the 2-regular partition λ.

There is one partition λ of n for which the corresponding module Dλ has remarkable properties, which we wish to describe. Suppose that n  ≥  3 is odd, and set n = 2m + 1. Consider the partition (m + 1,m) of n. It is known that

[formula]

Similarly, suppose that n  ≥  4 is even and write n = 2m. Then

[formula]

in this case.

Given an [formula]-module, D, say, let [formula] denote its restriction to Σn - 1. From what we have described, [formula] has a composition series consisting of irreducible modules of the form Dμ, where μ is a 2-regular partition of n - 1.

When n = 2m + 1 is odd, [formula] is indecomposable and has a composition series consisting of two copies of D(m + 1,m - 1). (When m = 1, D(m + 1,m - 1) = D(2) is the trivial module of Σ2.) When n = 2m is even,

[formula]

is irreducible. These results are proved in the main theorem of [\cite=Sheth].

We shall call these irreducible modules D(m + 1,m) and D(m + 1,m - 1) spin modules for Σ2m + 1, Σ2m, respectively, over [formula].

We say that an irreducible [formula]-module D is of quadratic type if there is a non-degenerate Σn- invariant quadratic form Q, say, defined on D (thus Σn acts as isometries of Q).

We do not know necessary and sufficient conditions on a 2-regular partition λ that tell us if Dλ is of quadratic type or not, except in the case that λ has only two parts. This enables us to show that the spin modules are of quadratic type provided n  ≥  7.

We quote the following lemma, proved in [\cite=GQ], Theorem 1.

Let λ be a 2-regular partition of n into two parts. Then Dλ is not of quadratic type precisely when the smaller part of λ is a power of 2, say 2r, where r  ≥  0, and [formula], where k is one of the 2r consecutive integers 2r + 1 + 2r - 1, , 2r + 2 - 2.

We can now deal with the quadratic type of the spin module.

The spin module of Σn over [formula] is of quadratic type except when n = 5 or 6.

Suppose that n = 2m is even and the spin module D(m + 1,m - 1) is not of quadratic type. Then Lemma [\ref=quadratic_type] implies that m - 1 = 2r, for some integer r  ≥  0, and hence n = 2r + 1 + 2. We must also have

[formula]

where k is one of 2r + 1 + 2r - 1, , 2r + 2 - 2.

It follows certainly that 2r + 1 divides k - 2, but 2r + 2 does not divide k - 2. Clearly, then, k cannot equal 2, nor can it equal 2r + 2 + 2, and the possibility that k - 2  ≥  3  ×  2r + 1 is excluded by the inequality k  ≤  2r + 2 - 2. Thus we must have k = n = 2 + 2r + 1.

When we take account of the inequality

[formula]

we deduce that 2r  ≤  3 and hence r = 0 or 1.

It is impossible that r = 0, since it implies k = 4, which is inconsistent with the inequality k  ≤  2r + 2 - 2 = 2. Thus, r = 1, k = 6, and it is the case that D(4,2) is not of quadratic type. This deals with the case that n is even.

Suppose next that n = 2m + 1 is odd. We have noted above that

[formula]

Since D(m + 2,m) is of quadratic type for m  ≥  3 by what we have proved above, we deduce that D(m + 1,m) is also of quadratic type for m  ≥  3. However, D(3,2) is not of quadratic type, by the criterion of Lemma [\ref=quadratic_type]. This completes the analysis.

Let Q be a non-degenerate Σ2m + 1-invariant quadratic form defined on the spin module D(m + 1,m). Let U be the socle of [formula]. Then, U is irreducible, has dimension 2m - 1 and is totally singular with respect to Q.

We have remarked that [formula] is indecomposable, having exactly two composition factors, both isomorphic to D(m + 1,m - 1). It follows that the socle U of [formula] is irreducible, isomorphic to D(m + 1,m - 1), and hence has dimension 2m - 1.

Let f be the polarization of Q and let [formula] be the perpendicular subspace of U with respect to f. Since U and f are invariant under Σ2m, [formula] is also invariant under the group. It follows that [formula] is a subspace of U that is also Σ2m-invariant. The irreducibility of U implies that [formula] or U.

Now if [formula], the general equality that

[formula]

implies that [formula] is the direct sum of the two invariant submodules U and [formula]. This contradicts the fact that U is the socle.

We deduce that [formula], and hence U is totally isotropic with respect to f. This implies that

[formula]

for all elements u and w in U, and hence Q is a linear mapping from U to [formula]. The subset of all singular vectors in U is then a subspace of U of codimension at most one in U, and this subspace is certainly Σ2m-invariant. The irreducibility of U forces the conclusion that Q is identically zero on U, and hence U is totally singular.

Construction of an invariant partial orthogonal spread

We have compiled enough information about the spin module to prove the following result relating to a partial orthogonal spread invariant under symmetric group action.

Suppose that m  ≥  3. Let V be a vector space of dimension 2m over [formula] that defines the spin module for Σ2m + 1 and let U denote the socle of [formula]. Let g1 = 1, , g2m + 1 be a set of coset representatives for Σ2m in Σ2m + 1. Then the 2m + 1 subspaces U = g1U, g2U, , g2m + 1U form a partial orthogonal spread in V, permuted by Σ2m + 1 according to its natural action.

We first note that, since m  ≥  3, V is indeed a module of quadratic type, by Lemma [\ref=quadratic_type_of_spin], and Lemma [\ref=socle] implies that U is totally singular with respect to the invariant non-degenerate quadratic form. Let g be any element of Σ2m + 1 not in Σ2m. Consider the subspace gU, which is also totally singular.

We claim that gU  ≠  U. For if gU = U, U is invariant under the subgroup of Σ2m + 1 generated by g and Σ2m. Since Σ2m is a maximal subgroup of Σ2m + 1, this subgroup is all of Σ2m + 1. But as V is irreducible for Σ2m + 1, U cannot be invariant under Σ2m + 1. We deduce that gU  ≠  U, as claimed.

Consider now the subspace [formula], which we have just shown is not the whole of U. It is easy to see that [formula] is invariant under the subgroup [formula] of Σ2m. If we assume, as we may, that Σ2m is the subgroup of Σ2m + 1 fixing 1 in the natural representation of Σ2m + 1 on the numbers [formula], we see that [formula] is the subgroup fixing 1 and g(1). We may then identify this subgroup unambiguously as Σ2m - 1, since the subgroups of Σ2m + 1 fixing 1 and a different number are conjugate.

We know that U affords the spin representation of Σ2m, and its restriction to Σ2m - 1 is irreducible. Thus the only subspaces of U that are invariant under Σ2m - 1 are U and 0. We deduce that [formula], as required, and the rest of the theorem follows from this argument.

Let G be a finite group of order at least 6. Then G acts in a regular transitive manner on a partial orthogonal spread of size |G| defined on a quadratic space of dimension 2m over [formula], where m is the integer part of |G| / 2.

Suppose first that |G| = 2m + 1, where m  ≥  3. We may embed G into Σ2m + 1 by means of its regular representation. Then G permutes the subspaces in the partial orthogonal spread described in Theorem [\ref=orthogonal_spread] in a regular transitive manner, as required.

Suppose next that |G| = 2m is even, with m  ≥  3. We may embed G into Σ2m + 1 in such a way that G fixes one point and permutes the remaining 2m points regularly. Then, in the action on the partial orthogonal spread described in Theorem [\ref=orthogonal_spread], G clearly fixes one subspace and permutes the other 2m subspaces regularly.

Note. If |G| = 3, 4 or 5, we may embed G into Σ7 and then show that G acts transitively on a partial orthogonal spread of size |G| defined on a quadratic space of dimension 8 over [formula]. However, a group of order 4 or 5 does not act transitively on a partial orthogonal spread of size 4 or 5 on a space of dimension 4 over [formula], since a complete spread only contains three subspaces in such a case. A similar remark holds for a group of order 3 acting on a two-dimensional space over [formula].

Extension of the partial spread when [formula]

When we take into account the influence of the alternating subgroup A2m + 1 of Σ2m + 1, we shall show that if [formula], the partial orthogonal spread of size 2m + 1 just described can be extended by two more maximal totally singular subspaces to give a partial orthogonal spread of size 2m + 3. The two additional subspaces are invariant under the alternating group A2m + 1 and are interchanged by any odd permutation in Σ2m + 1.

In order to find these additional subspaces, it is necessary to describe how A2m + 1 acts on the spin module. The results we need to know are quite sensitive to properties of the integer m, and require careful explanation.

The spin module D(m + 1,m) of Σ2m + 1 over [formula] splits as a direct sum of two non-isomorphic irreducible [formula]-modules if [formula] or if [formula]. The two A2m + 1-modules are conjugate under the action of Σ2m + 1, as described by Clifford's theorem.

This follows from Theorem 6.1 of [\cite=Ben].

The next question we need to address is whether or not the two irreducible [formula]-modules described in Lemma [\ref=splitting] are self-dual. Here again, the answer is not obvious, and depends on the residue of m modulo 4. It seems that to establish what we want to know, we must invoke an alternative construction of the spin module over [formula].

Let Γ2m + 1 denote either of the two non-isomorphic double covers of Σ2m + 1. The commutator subgroup of Γ2m + 1 has index 2 in Γ2m + 1 and is a double cover of A2m + 1, which we shall denote by 2m + 1. Since 2m + 1 is an extension of a central subgroup of order 2 by A2m + 1, given any element of odd order in A2m + 1, there is a unique element of the same order that projects onto it under the canonical homomorphism from 2m + 1 onto A2m + 1. We shall refer to this element of 2m + 1 as the canonical inverse image of the given element of odd order in A2m + 1.

Γ2m + 1 has a faithful irreducible complex representation of degree 2m, known as the basic spin representation (it is an example of a so-called projective representation of Σ2m + 1). Let θ denote the character of the basic spin representation. Schur shows in [\cite=Schur], Formula VII*, p. 205, that θ is rational-valued. Furthermore, it follows Theorem 7.7 of [\cite=W] that θ defines an absolutely irreducible Brauer character modulo the prime 2. Corollary 9.4 of Chapter IV of [\cite=F] implies then that θ has Schur index one over the field [formula] of 2-adic numbers. Thus, since θ certainly takes values in [formula], we deduce that the basic spin representation may be realized over [formula].

Let [formula] denote the ring of 2-adic integers in [formula]. R is a principal ideal domain and it follows that there is a Γ2m + 1-invariant [formula]-lattice L, say, of rank 2m which affords the basic spin representation. The quotient L / 2L is then a vector space, [formula], say, of dimension 2m over [formula]. Since the central involution of Γ2m + 1 acts as - I on L, this involution acts trivially on [formula], and thus [formula] is naturally an [formula]-module, which it turns out is isomorphic to the spin module D(m + 1,m) we have been considering.

Working over the algebraic closure of [formula], the basic spin module is reducible on restriction to 2m + 1. This splitting does not necessarily occur over [formula], since we need a square root of ( - 1)m(2m + 1) for it to take place. We refer to [\cite=Schur], Formula VII*, p. 205, for this theory. Schur shows that θ splits into two different irreducible characters of 2m + 1, θ1 and θ2, say. These characters θ1 and θ2 are real-valued if and only if m is even. Furthermore, θ1 and θ2 differ on the canonical inverse image of a 2m + 1-cycle. In particular, if m is odd, θ1 and θ2 take non-real values on the canonical inverse image of a 2m + 1-cycle.

Now θ restricted to elements of odd order is the Brauer character of the spin module D(m + 1,m) of Σ2m + 1. Since we know that D(m + 1,m) is reducible on restriction to A2m + 1, the Brauer characters of the irreducible constituents are θ1 and θ2, again restricted to elements of odd order. Finally, since θ1 and θ2 are not real-valued on the canonical inverse image of a 2m + 1-cycle, the Brauer characters defined by θ1 and θ2 are not real-valued, and consequently, the two irreducible constituents of [formula] are not self-dual.

When we collect the information we have derived from the work of Schur, we have proved the following important result.

The spin module Dm + 1,m of Σ2m + 1 over [formula] splits as a direct sum of two non-isomorphic irreducible [formula]-modules if [formula]. The two [formula]-modules are not self-dual in this case.

We proceed to extend the partial orthogonal spread when [formula].

Suppose that [formula]. Let V be a vector space of dimension 2m over [formula] that defines the spin module for Σ2m + 1 and let U denote the socle of [formula]. Let [formula], where U1 and U2 are non-isomorphic irreducible [formula]-modules. Then U1 and U2 are both totally singular.

Furthermore, let g1 = 1, , g2m + 1 be a set of coset representatives for Σ2m in Σ2m + 1. Then U = g1U, g2U, , g2m + 1U, U1 and U2 form a partial orthogonal spread in V consisting of 2m + 3 subspaces.

We note that all 2m + 3 subspaces described above have dimension 2m - 1. We also proved in Lemma [\ref=not_self_dual] that U1 and U2 are not self-dual. Since they are both irreducible under the action of A2m + 1, it follows in a straightforward way (as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=socle]) that U1 and U2 are both totally singular.

We claim that U  ≠  U1. For, U is invariant under Σ2m, whereas U1 is invariant under A2m + 1 but not under Σ2m + 1. Let g be any odd permutation in Σ2m. Then [formula] also, and hence gU1 = U2. Now if U = U1, then U = gU = gU1 = U2. This is clearly a contradiction.

We deduce that [formula] is a proper subspace of U, since dim U =  dim U1. [formula] is also invariant under [formula]. We also know from the previous section of this paper that U is an irreducible [formula]-module, isomorphic to the spin module D(m + 1,m - 1). Since m is odd by assumption, [formula] is irreducible, by Theorem 1.1 of [\cite=Ben]. Thus the only A2m-submodules of U are U and 0. Since [formula] is an A2m-submodule, and not equal to U, it must be 0. A similar argument proves that [formula] also.

Finally, let h be any element of Σ2m + 1 not in Σ2m, and consider [formula]. Since h- 1U1 = U1 or U2, we see that

[formula]

since we have proved that [formula]. Similarly, [formula] also. This completes the proof.

This argument shows, for example, that the partial orthogonal spread of seven subspaces in an 8-dimensional space over [formula], invariant under the action of Σ7, can be extended to a complete spread of nine subspaces, also invariant under Σ7.

Action of A9 on a complete spread in 8 dimensions

We have just shown that Σ7 acts on a complete spread of nine subspaces in an 8-dimensional space over [formula]. We intend to give another explanation of this fact by showing that A9 acts on a complete spread of nine subspaces in an 8-dimensional space over [formula] and then observing that Σ7 is a subgroup of A9.

We take as our starting point the data that A9 has three inequivalent irreducible representations of degree 8 over [formula]. We need to exclude one of these representations from consideration, and this is the so-called deleted permutation module, which arises from the natural permutation action of A9 on nine points. The restriction of the deleted permutation module to A8 has a composition series consisting of an irreducible module of dimension 6 and two copies of the trivial module, and this is not what we want.

The modules that we require arise from the restriction of the 16-dimensional spin module D(5,4) of Σ9 to A9. We remarked already that Theorem 6.1 of [\cite=Ben] implies that [formula] is the direct sum of two non-isomorphic [formula]-modules. These two 8-dimensional modules are both self-dual. By way of proof, albeit not a self-contained one, we can refer to p.85 of [\cite=atlas], where we see that all three inequivalent irreducible representations of A9 of degree 8 in characteristic 2 support A9-invariant quadratic forms.

We can now proceed to fashion this information into a statement about the action of A9 on a complete orthogonal spread.

Let V be an [formula]-module of dimension 8 defined as an irreducible constituent of the restriction of the spin module D(5,4) of Σ9. Then V is a module of quadratic type. Let U be an irreducible [formula]-submodule of V. Then U is 4-dimensional and is totally singular. Moreover, if g1, , g9 are a set of coset representatives for A8 in A9, the nine subspaces giU, 1  ≤  i  ≤  9, form a complete orthogonal spread in V.

We first note that we can take the Brauer character of A9 acting on V to be that denoted by φ3 in the table found on p.85 of [\cite=atlas]. (The character φ4 has the same properties as φ3, and is conjugate to φ3 under the action of Σ9.) As we noted above, V is of quadratic type. (This also follows from the fact that D(5,4) is of quadratic type and V is self-dual, since its Brauer character is real-valued.)

Reference to the table on p.48 of [\cite=atlas] shows that the restriction of φ3 to A8 consists of two different irreducible Brauer characters of degree 4, one being the complex conjugate of the other. Now it is a fact that V is reducible as an [formula]-module. To see this, we note that A8 is isomorphic to the general linear group GL[formula]. The Brauer characters that occur in the restriction of φ3 to A8 are those of the natural 4-dimensional module for GL[formula] over [formula] and its contragredient (or dual). If V were irreducible as an [formula]-module, it would follow that the two non-isomorphic irreducible modules for GL[formula] were Galois-conjugate over [formula], which is not the case, as they are defined over [formula].

This argument establishes that U is 4-dimensional and furthermore, it is not self-dual, since its Brauer character is not real-valued. This then implies that U is totally singular.

To complete the proof, we imitate the proof of Theorem [\ref=orthogonal_spread].

Let g be any element of A9 not in A8. Consider the subspace gU, which is also totally singular. We claim that gU  ≠  U. For if gU = U, U is invariant under the subgroup of A9 generated by g and A8. Since A8 is a maximal subgroup of A9, this subgroup is all of A9. But as V is irreducible for A9, U cannot be invariant under A9. We deduce that gU  ≠  U, as claimed.

Consider now the subspace [formula], which we have just shown is not the whole of U. It is easy to see that [formula] is invariant under the subgroup [formula] of A9. We may take A8 to be the subgroup of A9 fixing 1 in the natural representation of A9 on the numbers [formula]. Then we see that [formula] is the subgroup fixing 1 and g(1), which is isomorphic to A7.

We know that U affords an irreducible representation of A8, and its restriction to A7 is irreducible. Thus the only subspaces of U that are invariant under A7 are U and 0. We deduce that [formula], as required, and the rest of the theorem follows from this argument.

We note that any group G of order 9 may be embedded into A9 by its regular representation. It follows that G acts in a regular transitive manner on a complete orthogonal spread of size 9 defined on a quadratic space of dimension 8 over [formula]. This is a consequence of the theorem of Kantor and Williams already described when G is cyclic, but seems to be a new observation when G is elementary abelian. Similarly, any non-cyclic group G of order 8 may be embedded into A8 by its regular representation, and then into A9. It follows that G acts in a regular transitive manner on a partial orthogonal spread of size 8 defined on a quadratic space of dimension 8 over [formula].

There are 135 non-zero singular vectors in the 8-dimensional quadratic space of index 4 over [formula]. These vectors are permuted transitively by A9. The action is imprimitive, there being nine blocks of imprimitivity, namely, the non-zero vectors in each of the 4-dimensional subspaces that constitute the invariant complete spread. The stabilizer of a block is isomorphic to A8, and it acts doubly transitively on the 15 non-zero vectors in the block.
