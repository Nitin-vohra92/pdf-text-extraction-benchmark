Spatiotemporal velocity-velocity correlation function in fully developed turbulence

Kolmogorov made a fundamental step in the understanding of the statistical properties of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence in his seminal K41 theory [\cite=Kolmogorov41a] [\cite=Kolmogorov41c]. This theory predicts that, in three-dimensional turbulence, energy, which is injected at a typical large (integral) length scale L by the external stirring, is conserved accross an inertial range of scales, through a constant-flux transfer mechanism (the energy cascade), until it is dissipated by molecular viscosity at a small (Kolmogorov) length scale η. Assuming universality and scale invariance in the inertial range, dimensional considerations then yield scaling predictions such as the power-law decay of the kinetic energy spectrum with the well-known -5/3 exponent. These predictions quite reliably describe most experimental and numerical observations, at least for the energy spectrum and low-order structure functions (moments of equal-time velocity differences) [\cite=Frisch95]. However, despite many theoretical efforts, the derivation of these scaling predictions from fundamental principles, that is from Navier-Stokes (NS) equation for the fluid dynamics, is still unsatisfactory [\cite=Frisch95].

In this work, we derive analytical solutions of fixed-point Non-Perturbative (or Functional) Renormalisation Group (NPRG) equations associated with NS equation. These equations are exact in a particular large wave-number limit. We obtain the full space and time dependent correlation and response functions at distances smaller than the integral scale L. Let us highlight the main features of these solutions. In the inertial range, the kinetic energy spectrum is found to decay with the expected k- 5 / 3 power-law. Moreover, the solutions correctly account for the "sweeping effect", which is imposed by the large-scale motion on the Eulerian correlation at small scales [\cite=Tennekes75]. Indeed, the energy spectrum calculated as a function of the frequency displays a ω- 5 / 3 decay, as observed in experiments or numerical simulations for Eulerian velocities [\cite=Frisch95] [\cite=Chevillard05]. This is a non-trivial result from a theoretical point of view [\cite=Yakhot89] [\cite=Chen89] [\cite=Nelkin89] [\cite=Gotoh93]. Our analytical solution in the inertial range goes beyond equal-time or equal-distance quantities, since it describes the complete spatiotemporal dependence of the correlation function. Its spatial Fourier transform is found to take the form exp ( - αk2t2), where k is the wave-vector and t the time interval. In order to test this prediction, we perform direct numerical simulations of fully developed isotropic turbulence from NS equation and record the time-dependence of the correlation function. The agreement is remarkable. The exact flow equations encompass another interesting solution, relevant for the dissipative range of scales beyond the inertial range. Several mostly empirical expressions were proposed to describe the behavior of the energy spectrum in this regime [\cite=Monin73]. They all suggest "an approximately exponential decay" [\cite=Nelkin89]. Our analytical solution in the dissipative range predicts a crossover from the k- 5 / 3 power-law to a stretched exponential decay, following exp ( - μk2 / 3). Our numerical data in the dissipative range accurately match this behavior.

In summary, we provide analytical solutions for the spatiotemporal correlation function, which are very accurately confirmed by the numerical data. Such analytical expressions, confirmed by numerical data, constitute a major step in the theoretical understanding and modelling of isotropic and homogeneous three-dimensional turbulence, since they are directly derived from NS equation without approximation for large wave-numbers. This result opens promising perpectives for the calculation of higher-order structure functions and intermittency effects, and also for the investigation of two-dimensional turbulence. The paper is organized as follows. We first present the theory underlying the exact NPRG flow equations and their solutions. We focus on the correlation function. The complete resolution of the equations and the results for the response function are provided in the Supplementary information. In the second part, we bring out the main properties of these solutions, and compare them with the numerical data. The details of the numerical simulations are summarized in the last section.

Theory

Our starting point is Navier-Stokes equation of fluid dynamics

[formula]

In this equation, the velocity field [formula], the pressure field p, and the external stirring force [formula] depend on the space-time coordinates [formula], ν is the kinematic viscosity and ρ the density of the fluid. The presence of the external forcing is necessary to sustain a stationary turbulent state. We consider incompressible flows, satisfying [formula].

The Renormalisation Group is a natural theoretical approach to calculate the properties of a strongly-correlated system (the turbulent fluid) starting from a mesoscopic description, like Eq. ([\ref=ns]) [\cite=zinnjustin89]. At characteristic distances much smaller than the integral scale, the statistical behavior of the velocity field is observed to be independent of the actual detail of the forcing. Therefore, one can conveniently perform a statistical average over stochastic forcings peaked at scales of order L. NS equation with stochastic forcing can then be cast into a field theory, with NS action, following a standard formalism [\cite=Janssen76] [\cite=Dominicis76]. However, applying perturbative RG to turbulence has a long history, dating back to the seventies [\cite=Forster76] [\cite=Forster77] [\cite=Dominicis79] [\cite=Fournier83], and has turned out to be extremely challenging [\cite=Adzhemyan99] [\cite=Zhou10]. In this context, some of us have developed an alternative RG approach, based on non-perturbative RG (NPRG), and have derived exact flow equations for the correlation function in a certain large wave-number limit, specified below.

The NPRG is a modern implementation of Wilson's original idea [\cite=wilson74], which is to calculate the thermodynamical properties of a system by progressively, scale by scale, averaging over fluctuations. It is an efficient procedure to compute physical properties even in the presence of strong-correlations and fluctuations at all scales (for instance in critical phenomena) [\cite=Berges02]. The NPRG consists in constructing a series of scale-dependent effective models, each of which describing the physics of the system at a given momentum scale κ. An initial condition can be specified when κ is a large wave-number scale Λ, chosen much larger than η- 1. At such scales, all fluctuations are suppressed and a mean-field description applies [\cite=Berges02] [\cite=Canet16]. The physical statistical properties of the model are obtained in the "infinite volume" limit κ  →  0. The NPRG formalism provides exact RG flow equations, governing how these effective models change when the renormalisation scale κ runs from Λ to 0 [\cite=Berges02]. Solving these RG flow equations is thus a way to solve the model, that is, to compute the physical properties of a system from a given initial description. We consider the exact flow equations for the scale-dependent two-point (i.e. two-space point and two-time) correlation function [formula] (translational invariance in time and space is assumed). However, the general flow equations for the n-point functions involve the (n + 1)- and (n + 2)-point functions, such that one should consider an infinite hierarchy of flow equations. As common in many theoretical approaches, the usual way to deal with such an infinite hierarchy is to devise an approximation scheme to truncate it and obtain a closed equation for the two-point functions (a closure scheme).

Such a closure was achieved for the NS problem within the NPRG context in several related works [\cite=Tomassini97] [\cite=Monasterio12] [\cite=Canet16]. These works rely on a truncation at quadratic order in the velocity fields, neglecting all higher-order functions but the unrenormalized non-linearity (triple velocities). This approximation, referred to as Leading Order (LO) approximation, provides an accurate description of the small wave-number regime of the theory (see detailed discussion in [\cite=Canet16]). It was shown at LO that the NPRG flow reaches a fixed point, which describes the scale-invariant universal turbulent stationary state. The existence of this fixed point was also well-known from perturbative RG [\cite=Adzhemyan99] [\cite=Zhou10].

However, some of us made a decisive step in [\cite=Canet16], by showing that truncation can be avoided. The closure of the flow equation for the correlation function can be achieved without approximation, by only exploiting the symmetries of the NS action. This result, exceptional in the NPRG framework, relies on the existence of very constraining symmetries (time-gauged - or time-dependent, ones, in particular a time-gauged shift unveiled in [\cite=Canet16]) and the extensive use of the related Ward identities. Moreover, as explained in [\cite=Canet16], the RG flow for NS has a very peculiar property compared to standard critical phenomena, named the "non-decoupling" property: the flow does not vanish when the RG scale is much smaller than a given wave-number of the correlation function. In particular, the non-decoupling property opens the door for possible intermittency effects . The flow equation for the correlation function obtained in this symmetry-based closure is exact in the large wave-number limit, which means for wavevectors [formula] and frequencies ω  ≫  κz, with z the dynamical exponent. It reads as

[formula]

in units where ν  =  ρ = 1. This flow equation involves a quantity, denoted by Iκ, which does not depend on k and ω, but only on the RG scale, and which reaches the constant value I* at the fixed point. I* is an integral of some derivatives of Cκ over wave-vector [formula] and frequency [formula]. Hence it cannot be computed from the flow equation ([\ref=eq:flow]) which describes the opposite regime. Nonetheless, it can be calculated within an approximation such as LO. Its sign determines the nature of the solution: it delineates two regimes, which correspond to the inertial and the dissipative regimes (see Supplementary information). We discuss below the solutions of Eq. ([\ref=eq:flow]) at the fixed-point in these two regimes.

Inertial regime

In the inertial regime (which corresponds to [formula]), the correlation function takes the form of a linear combination of expressions of the form

[formula]

where cC is an integration constant . Equal-time quantities, such as the energy spectrum, can be calculated from ([\ref=corr_inert]). This yields

[formula]

in agreement with K41 scaling. Note that considering an infinite combination of solutions ([\ref=corr_inert]) with an unbounded distribution of parameters would yield corrections to this scaling, that is intermittency effects. However, these effects are expected to be very small for two-point quantities [\cite=Frisch95], and are not studied here. To illustrate this result, the energy spectra obtained from direct numerical simulations at different Taylor-scale Reynolds number Rλ are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig1]. The data come from the simulations we ran for Rλ = 90 and Rλ = 160, and from the John Hopkins Turbulence database [\cite=jhtbd] for Rλ = 433. These spectra exhibit a substantial inertial range, extending with Rλ, with a clear k- 5 / 3 decay. The relevant parameters for the simulation data are given in the Supplementary material.

One can also compute the energy spectrum as a function of the frequency, which yields

[formula]

This result corresponds to what is observed in experiments and numerical simulations for velocities measured in a fixed reference frame (Eulerian velocities) [\cite=Frisch95]. The equality of the exponents in ([\ref=eq:spectrumk]) and ([\ref=eq:spectrumO]) is the first remarkable feature of this solution, and it is rooted in the fact that the wave-number and frequency appear as the combination ω / k in ([\ref=corr_inert]). Let us recall that the dynamical exponent for NS in d = 3 is z = 2 / 3. Standard scaling theory would yield for the correlation function a scaling form with the scaling variable ω / k2 / 3. This would imply that the k- 5 / 3 decay in wave-vector is related to a ω- 2 decay in frequency (see Supplementary information), which is characteristic of velocities measured along the flow (Lagrangian velocities), but is not observed for Eulerian ones [\cite=Chevillard05]. Here, the solution ([\ref=corr_inert]) correctly predicts the same power in frequency or wave-vector. Let us underline that we consider a fluid without mean flow. This observation is hence not related to Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis. In contrast, in the absence of mean flow, the ω- 5 / 3 decay is usually attibuted to what is named the sweeping effect, which is the random advection of small eddies past the observation point by large energy-containing eddies. This can be viewed as a statistical form of Taylor's hypothesis, as introduced by Tennekes [\cite=Tennekes75]. This result is non-trivial from a field-theoretical point of view, since it implies that standard scale invariance is violated .

The solution ([\ref=corr_inert]) is not limited to equal-time or equal-position quantities. For instance, the time-dependence of the spatial Fourier transform of the correlation function is given by the inverse Fourier transform in time of ([\ref=corr_inert]) as

[formula]

The variable t is a time difference, in the stationary regime. We have computed this correlation function in numerical simulations. The result is illustrated on Fig. [\ref=fig2]. In particular, the "time-dependent energy spectrum" 4πk2C(t,k) is plotted in log-scale as a function of k2t2 for different values of k. The curves for each k appear as parallel straight lines as expected from the e-  αk2t2 functional form. The value of α estimated from the numerical data decreases when Rλ increases (see Supplementary information), showing that the more turbulent the flow is, the longer the correlation time. The NPRG solution in the inertial range hence very accurately describe the numerical data. Let us now discuss the solution in the dissipative range.

Dissipative range

In the present work, the sign of the integral I* is not determined and should be calculated from the numerical integration of the complete RG equations. In a previous study [\cite=Canet16], the full equations were solved within the LO approximation and they yielded a positive sign at the low wave-number fixed-point solution. We do not have at present a reliable control of the behavior of this integral in the regime of large wave numbers. We hence analyze phenomenologically the behavior of the exact flow equation ([\ref=eq:flow]) at the fixed-point considering now the case of I* < 0. We show that it accurately accounts for the cross-over between the inertial and dissipative ranges. Let us describe this solution. When I* < 0, the flow equation ([\ref=eq:flow]) admits a fixed-point solution in terms of separated variables, derived in the Supplementary information. It reads as a linear combination of expressions of the form

[formula]

where cC and μ are integration constants, (which could be computed from the numerical integration of the full flow equations) . As for the inertial range solution, the linear combinations could give rise to intermittency effects, which are here neglected. The associated kinetic energy spectrum can be computed and one obtains

[formula]

Hence, this solution predicts, beyond the k- 5 / 3 Kolmogorov decay, a crossover to a stretched exponential decay with argument k2 / 3, which is relevant to describe the dissipative range. Several expressions have been proposed for this regime, mainly under the form of a stretched exponential exp ( - cky), but with different values for y (1/2 [\cite=Tatarskii67], 3/2 [\cite=Uberoi69], 4/3 [\cite=Pao65] or 2 [\cite=Novikov61] [\cite=Gurvich67]). These expressions are mostly based on numerical fits of the experimental data or (approximate) analytical considerations [\cite=Monin73]. The common wisdom is that the spectrum decay is "approximately exponential" in the dissipative range [\cite=Nelkin89]. In order to assess this behavior, we analyzed the numerical energy spectra in the dissipative range. We very accurately found the predicted stretched exponential on the scale k2 / 3, as illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig3]. The fitted values for μ are given in the Supplementary information.

Direct Numerical Simulations

The numerical simulations performed to obtain the data of incompressible forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence at Rλ = 90 and 160 are based on a pseudo-spectral code with second-order explicit Runge-Kutta time-advancement [\cite=Lagaert14]. The simulation domain is discretized using 2563, resp. 5123, grid points on a domain of length 2π for Rλ = 90, resp. 160. A classic 3/2 rule is used for dealiasing the non-linear convection term and a projection method in spectral space is used to enforce the divergence-free condition. The forcing is a fully random forcing concentrated at small wave numbers [\cite=Alvelius99]. The simulation parameters are chosen such that k maxη  >  1.5, where k max is the maximum wavenumber in the domain. A typical configuration of the modulus of the velocity field obtained in the simulation for Rλ = 160 is represented at different times in Fig. [\ref=fig4]. Additional data from the John Hopkins Turbulence Database [\cite=jhtbd] are also used for the kinetic energy spectra in Fig. [\ref=fig1] and [\ref=fig3]. They correspond to simulations on 10243 nodes of isotropic turbulence with Rλ≃433.

Conclusion

In this work, we provide an analytical expression for the space and time dependent correlation (and response) functions of a fluid in a forced turbulent state. These expressions are derived from NPRG flow equations which are exact in a certain large wave-number limit. These equations describe two different regimes, which are associated with inertial range and dissipative range scales respectively. We showed that these expressions yield predictions beyond the standard observations, (such as the k- 5 / 3 decay of the kinetic energy spectrum). The essential aspects are a ω- 5 / 3 decay of this spectrum, as observed for Eulerian velocities, and which reflects the sweeping effect; the time-dependence for the correlation function in k-space following exp ( - αt2k2), and a stretched exponential decay as exp ( - μk2 / 3) of the spectrum in the dissipative range. We believe that deriving such analytical solutions, directly from NS equation, and not on phenomenological basis, constitutes a major progress in the theoretical understanding of isotropic and homogeneous turbulence, and its modelling at all scales. It opens new perspectives in many respects. An important issue to be addressed is the numerical integration of the complete flow equations (in both the small and large wave-number sectors), to pinpoint the crossover between the two inertial-range and dissipative-range solutions, and also to assess intermittency corrections. Another important direction is the investigation of two-dimensional turbulence, and the derivation of correlation functions for scales both below the integral scale L (direct cascade) and above (inverse cascade). Moreover, a promising perspective is the computation of higher-order structure functions, and the determination of intermittency effects in this case, which are expected to be much more pronounced as the order increases.

We consider the Non-Perturbative Renormalization Group (NPRG) flow equations for the (scale-dependent) correlation function [formula] and response function [formula] in Fourier space. In this notation, [formula] is the wave-vector, ω the frequency, and κ the (momentum) RG scale. The response function is related to the mean value [formula] at scale κ through the relation In this expression, [formula] is the Fourier transform of the correlator of the Gaussian-distributed external stochastic forcing [formula], defined as The function Nκ is peaked at the typical scale κ (see [\cite=Canet16]). The RG flow starts at the initial scale κ  =  Λ  ≫  η- 1 with η the Kolmogorov scale, where the dynamics for the velocity field is given by Navier-Stokes equation (or equivalently by Navier-Stokes "bare" action). As the RG scale κ is lowered, more and more fluctuation modes are averaged out. The limit κ  →  0 describes the "infinite volume" physics, taking into account all the fluctuations. The evolution of [formula] and [formula] with the RG scale is given by exact flow equations, or more precisely by an infinite hierarchy of flow equations. As explained in the main text, a fundamental progress was brought out in [\cite=Canet16], where it was shown that the flow equations for the two-point functions can be closed exactly in the limit of large wave-vectors [formula] and frequencies ω  ≫  κz. This result relies on the (time-gauged) symmetries of the NS field theory. These flow equations and their solutions are presented below. Prior to this, let us recall the results obtained when the closure is achieved, as is usually the case, by a truncation, such as the Leading Order (LO) approximation, implemented in [\cite=Tomassini97] [\cite=Monasterio12] [\cite=Canet16].

NPRG results at LO approximation

The approximation implemented for NS is very much inspired from similar ones developed in the context of NPRG studies of the closely related Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation for interface growth and kinetic roughening [\cite=Kardar86]. Indeed, the NS equation shares common time-gauged symmetries with the KPZ equation [\cite=Canet15]. This approximation scheme has yielded for KPZ very accurate results [\cite=Canet10] [\cite=Canet11a] [\cite=Kloss12]. The LO approximation is the simplest one, which consists in a truncation at quadratic order in the velocity fields of the NS effective action and a simplication of the frequency sector. It means that higher-order correlation functions (more precisely vertex functions), are neglected, except for the bare non-linearity. The full functional wave-vector dependence of two-point functions is preserved, while the frequency dependence is restricted to the bare one [\cite=Canet10] [\cite=Canet16]. This approximation allows for the (approximate) closure of the flow equations for the two-point functions.

As explained in [\cite=Canet16], the LO approximation is well-controlled in the small wave-vector sector [formula], and thus provides an accurate description of this regime. The flow equations at LO have been integrated numerically, for an integral-scale forcing, in three dimensions [\cite=Tomassini97] [\cite=Canet16], and also in two dimensions [\cite=Canet16]. It was shown that the corresponding NPRG flow reaches a fixed-point, which describes the regime of fully developed (stationary) turbulence, typically below a RG scale [formula] with s0≃ - 10. The numerical energy spectrum obtained in d = 3 at the fixed point is displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig5]. It exhibits the kd - 1 = k2 expected behavior at energy-range scales, which corresponds to the equipartition of energy in this quasi-equilibrium regime, and the k- 5 / 3 decay characteristic of the energy cascade in the inertial range. The Kolmogorov constant CK for the spectrum, defined by E(k) = CKε2 / 3k- 5 / 3, was estimated for different forcing profiles in [\cite=Tomassini97], which reported that CK tends for very narrow forcing profiles to the value CK≃1.78, compatible with experimental results [\cite=Praskovsky94] and numerical simulations (see Table [\ref=tab1]).

Exact NPRG flow equations in the large wave-number limit

Let us now consider the flow equations for the two-point (response and correlation) functions which were derived in [\cite=Canet16] without resorting to an approximation, but only exploiting the Ward identities associated with the time-gauged symmetries of the NS action. These flow equations follow from a symmetry-based closure which is exact in the limit of large wave-vector [formula] and frequency ω  ≫  κz. They read as where Iκ is the integral

[formula]

with [formula]. Rκ is an "effective mass" which ensures the selection of fluctuation modes along the RG flow, and which vanishes in the limit κ  →  0, see [\cite=Canet16] for detail. Note that this integral is a function of the scale κ only. It does not depend on the external wave-vector k and frequency ω. Moreover, it is determined by the small wave-number sector. Indeed, as shown in [\cite=Canet16], the internal wave-vector q and frequency ϖ appearing in the integral are dominated by values of order [formula] and [formula] (with z the dynamical exponent), which are hence in the opposite regime as the one studied here. This integral can be reliably computed within an approximation controlled in the small wave-number sector, such as the LO one.

As recalled previously, the steady state of fully developed turbulence corresponds to a fixed-point of the RG flow equations. We hence focus in the following on the fixed-point equations. As usual in RG studies, the fixed point is most conveniently studied in terms of dimensionless and renormalized quantities, such that all explicit κ-dependence is absorbed. These dimensionless quantities are defined as The value of the dynamical exponent is z = 2 / 3 in d = 3 [\cite=Canet16]. We also introduce Iκ  =  κ2z - 2Îs. The flow equations ([\ref=eq:exactflow]) hence read in terms of dimensionless quantities as

[formula]

where a = 2 / 3 for [formula] and a = 13 / 3 for [formula]. In the following, hat symbols are dropped to alleviate notation. Because of isotropy, the correlation and response functions only depend on [formula]. Hence, defining [formula] and introducing the variables x = k2 / 3 and y  =  ωk- 2 / 3, one can show that the function Ks(x,y)  =  Ys(ω,k) satisfies the equation

[formula]

Fixed point equation

The fixed point equation corresponds by definition to ∂sKs = 0, and Is  →  I*, Ks(x,y)  →  K*(x,y) tend to fixed quantities independent of s. Hence, the fixed point equation reads as

[formula]

Let us seek the solutions of this equation. Their form depends on the sign of I*. At LO approximation, one finds that the value of Is is positive, and tends to a constant I* of the order 4.10- 2 at the fixed point. For wave-vectors k  ≫  κ satisfying Eq. ([\ref=eq:dif]), the small wave-number sector has already reached the fixed point, and the relevant value of I* is hence positive. The corresponding solution, which describes the inertial range of scales, is presented below.

Solution in the inertial range

When [formula], Eq. ([\ref=eq:dif]) takes the form of a diffusion equation in the variables x and y. The general solution of this equation is given by a linear combination of functions

[formula]

In the limit of large wave-vector k and frequency ω, the integration constants ω0 and k0 can be neglected and we hence study in the following the functions The kinetic energy spectrum is obtained from C as

[formula]

It decays as a power-law with the expected -5/3 Kolmogorov exponent. Let us notice that the combination of solutions ([\ref=corr_comp]) with an unbounded distribution of parameters could generate corrections to this scaling, corresponding to intermittency effects. However, they are not considered here since they are expected to be very small for the energy spectrum. These potential corrections could be determined by (numerically) integrating the complete RG flow equations, which is left for future work.

Let us now compute the energy spectrum as a function of the frequency. This yields

[formula]

Hence, the decay of the energy spectrum as a function of the frequency is found to also decay with a -5/3 exponent, as observed in experiments and numerical simulations. This is a non-trivial result, since it does not correspond to the expected (anomalous) scaling between space and time encoded in the dynamical exponent z = 2 / 3. Indeed, if one assumes that the correlation function depends on the scaling variable kω1 / z and makes this change of variables in the integral ([\ref=eq:spectrumk]), one obtains a ω- 2 decay for the energy spectrum in frequency, as observed for Lagrangian velocities. The ω- 5 / 3 is usually interpreted as a consequence of the sweeping effect, as explained in the main text. This shows that this effect is properly taken into account in the solution ([\ref=eq:soldif]).

The solution ([\ref=eq:soldif]) encompasses both the space and time dependence. Whereas equal-time quantities are easily measured in experiments and numerical simulations, recording the time dependence is more difficult. The expression ([\ref=eq:soldif]) hence provides an interesting prediction, that we tested in numerical simulations, as explained in the main text, and that could be studied in experimental settings. The time dependence of the spatial Fourier transform of the correlation function can be deduced performing the inverse Fourier transform in time of ([\ref=eq:soldif]), that is

[formula]

It predicts a Gaussian dependence in t2k2. All the fitting parameters ensuing from the comparison with the numerical data are given in Table [\ref=tab1]. One finds that the correlation time increases with Rλ.

General flow equation

Let us notice that changing the RG variable s to u = s + x in Eq. ([\ref=eq:K]), the equation for the function Lu(x,y) = Ks(x,y) reads as

[formula]

Thus, the flow equation has the same form as the fixed-point equation ([\ref=eq:dif]), but with an effective scale dependence for the integral Iu - x, which involves the external wave-vector k (through x = (k / κ)2 / 3). This integral is not controlled by the equations ([\ref=eq:exactflow]), and should be computed from the numerical integration of the complete RG flow equations, which will be investigated in future work. It is hence difficult to infer its behavior. Let us here suppose that the RG evolution for some wave-numbers along the flow is controlled by a similar fixed-point equation but with an effective negative value of I*, and phenomenologically study the corresponding solution. In fact, we find that the associated solution describes an interesting asymptotic behavior, which is relevant for the dissipative range, although we cannot rigorously prove at this stage that it indeed applies to wave-vectors in this range.

The equation ([\ref=eq:dif]) admits for I* < 0 a solution with separated variables K(x,y) = f(x)h(y). The physically admissible solutions, i.e. decreasing at ω,k  →    ∞  , read as This solution for the correlation function leads to a stretched exponential decay for the kinetic energy spectrum following

[formula]

with the exponent k2 / 3. This stretched exponential is very accurately confirmed by the numerical data, as discussed in the main text. The values of μ estimated in numerical simulations are given in Table [\ref=tab1].
