Introduction

The CE phase is usually invoked to explain the formation of close binary systems with at least one compact star: the compact star is born as a core of a giant with a much larger radius than the separation of the observed binary. During the CE phase, angular momentum and energy is extracted from the system as the envelope is ejected and a close binary system emerges. Results of this evolution include cataclysmic variables [\citep=king1988a] [\citep=ritter2003a], close WD and main sequence (MS) binaries [\citep=schreiber2003a] [\citep=zorotovic2010a], double WDs [\citep=iben1985a] [\citep=han1995a] [\citep=nelemans2001a], Type Ia supernovae [\citep=iben1984a] [\citep=ruiter2009a] [\citep=toonen2012a], and many more [\citep=iben1993a] [\citep=taam2000a] [\citep=ivanova2013a].

The origin of magnetic fields in stars is still unknown, and it is debated if they are remainders from fields generated during the formation of a star (fossil field hypothesis) or if they are generated during the life of a star by dynamo processes [\citep=ferrario2015a]. WDs show magnetic fields with strengths up to 109 G and can also occur in binaries with accretion from a low-mass companion, so-called magnetic CVs [\citep=ferrario2015b]. The absence of magnetic WDs in wide binaries suggests a binary origin for both magnetic WDs and magnetic CVs [\citep=tout2008b] [\citep=briggs2015a]. In this scenario, magnetic fields are amplified by a dynamo process in the differentially rotating envelope during a CE phase [\citep=regos1995a] or in an accretion disk around the giant core that was formed from the tidally disrupted companion [\citep=nordhaus2011a]. The magnetic fields created during the CE phase have to be much larger than the final surface field of the WD because it is difficult to anchor the fields on the WD [\citep=potter2010a]. At the high-mass end of magnetic WDs, mergers of two WDs constitute a different channel that can explain large magnetic fields [\citep=zhu2015a]. In their population study, [\citet=briggs2015a] find that the major contribution comes from mergers during the CE phase.

Magnetic fields generated during the CE phase may also affect the shape and evolution of planetary nebulae (PNe) [\citep=nordhaus2006a] [\citep=nordhaus2007a]. The magnetic field generation relies again on a dynamo process in the differentially rotating envelope or in an accretion disk formed by the tidally disrupted companion. Magnetic fields have not been detected in post-AGB stars as remnants of PNe; the upper limits lie at 100 to 300 G [\citep=jordan2012c]. [\citet=tocknell2014a] used observational data on four jets in PNe to constrain the magnetic fields that are necessary to launch these jets via the Blandford-Payne mechanism [\citep=blandford1982a] to hundreds of G to a few kG. Three jets pre-date the CE event by few thousand years, one jet post-dates the CE event by a few thousand years. Thus, besides binarity itself [\citep=demarco2009a], magnetic fields can be an important factor for shaping PNe.

Up to now, the generation of magnetic fields during the CE phase was attributed to dynamo processes driven by shear due to differential rotation in the envelope or in an accretion disk. Here, we present the first magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the dynamical spiral-in during a CE phase. The simulations extend the hydrodynamics simulation of a CE phase of a [formula] RG interacting with a [formula] companion presented by [\citet=ohlmann2016a] and account for MHD effects.

Methods

The magnetohydrodynamics simulations presented here employ the moving-mesh code arepo [\citep=springel2010a] with additional modifications as introduced in [\citet=pakmor2016a] and [\citet=ohlmann2016a]. As initial model, the same [formula] RG with a [formula] He core is used as by [\citet=ohlmann2016a] after a relaxation step, during which spurious velocities are damped to reach a stable equilibrium. The core of the RG and the companion ([formula]) are represented by point masses with a gravitational potential that is softened at a length [formula]. Around the point masses, an adaptive refinement is enforced with the effective cell radius being smaller than h / 10 in a sphere of radius 4h around each point mass. During the simulation, h is always enforced to be lower than a fifth of the orbital separation. In the rest of the domain, refinement ensures similar cell masses according to the desired resolution. As in [\citet=ohlmann2016a], the companion is initially placed at the surface of the RG.

In addition to the simulation presented by [\citep=ohlmann2016a], magnetic fields are included. To this end, the ideal MHD solver as implemented by [\citet=pakmor2011d] and improved by [\citet=pakmor2013b] is utilized. As initial conditions, a magnetic dipole field was set up along the z axis as

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the initial surface field strength at the pole, R the stellar radius, [formula] the position inside the star, [formula] the normalized position, and [formula] the unit vector in z direction. The initial surface field is varied in different simulations (see Tab. [\ref=tab:simulations]); a value of 10- 6 G at the surface of the RG would correspond to a mG surface field at the ZAMS under the assumption of flux freezing. The initial magnetic field energy is negligible compared to the internal energy for all models.

Results

Overall Evolution

The magnetic fields during the evolution are strongly amplified with a similar evolution of the magnetic energy for all simulations (Tab. [\ref=tab:simulations], Fig. [\ref=fig:ebtime]) and is thus independent of the choice of the initial surface field strength. The evolution of the magnetic fields can be subdivided into three phases: an initial, fast amplification phase up to 3 d (lasting less than a fifth of the first orbit; Fig. [\ref=fig:ebtime], panel c), a slow amplification phase between 3 and 20 d (ending after slightly more than the first orbit; Fig. [\ref=fig:ebtime], panel d), and a saturation phase after 20 d (Fig. [\ref=fig:ebtime], panel b). During the fast amplification phase, an accretion stream around the companion emerges (shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:timeseries] at 1.5 d), and the magnetic field is amplified in this stream with an e-folding time of roughly 0.1 d (cf. Fig. [\ref=fig:ebtime], panel c). Regardless of the initial surface magnetic field (10- 10, 10- 6, and 10- 2 G, see Tab. [\ref=tab:simulations]), the total magnetic energy reaches a similar value of 2-[formula] erg after this phase at 3 d (Fig. [\ref=fig:ebtime], panel c); the further evolution is very similar for the different simulations (see panels d and b). For the highest surface field (10- 2 G, red dotted line in Fig. [\ref=fig:ebtime]), the total magnetic energy is initially dominated by the initial field configuration in the RG, which is unstable and decays; after 1 d, the total magnetic energy is already dominated by the fields around the companion (Fig. [\ref=fig:ebtime], panel c). During the slow amplification phase, the accretion stream is established and the amplification timescale decreases to about 3 d (see Tab. [\ref=tab:simulations]; Fig. [\ref=fig:ebtime], panel d; Fig. [\ref=fig:timeseries] at 8 d). After 20 d and slightly more than one orbit, the system enters the saturation phase and the total magnetic energy remains more or less constant at 4-[formula] erg (Fig. [\ref=fig:ebtime], panel b; Fig. [\ref=fig:timeseries] at 20 d and at 120 d; Tab. [\ref=tab:simulations]), which is less than a per cent of the total energy of the system ([formula] erg).

As a check, the simulation with [formula] G was repeated with a finer mass resolution of 7.7 million cells as opposed to 2.6 million cells for the other runs; this increase by a factor of 3 corresponds on average to an increase in spatial resolution by a factor of about 1.4. The evolution of this simulation is very similar to the lower-resolution simulation: the separation does not change significantly and the total magnetic energy deviates only between 15 and 40 d, when it is slightly larger for the high-resolution run (Fig. [\ref=fig:ebtime]). As demonstrated by [\citet=ohlmann2016a], it is important to resolve the gravitational interaction between the point masses and the gas which is ensured by requiring an effective resolution of at least ten cells per softening length already in the lower-resolution simulation. Increasing the resolution in the rest of the envelope does not significantly change the outcome. Moreover, an additional check with reduced resolution around the cores (5 cells per softening length) does not change the outcome significantly, either. Hence, the most important processes seem to be resolved by imposing the adaptive refinement around the cores to at least 5 to 10 cells per softening length.

Compared to the non-MHD run by [\citet=ohlmann2016a], the evolution of the orbit is very similar with the final separation at 120 d being at most 5% larger for the MHD simulations (Tab. [\ref=tab:simulations]). Thus, the dynamical impact of the magnetic fields is small, although slightly more mass is unbound during the first orbit (between 6.2% and 6.5% of the total envelope mass compared to 5.2% without magnetic fields after 60 d), but the difference becomes smaller at later times, when the ejected mass increases. Moreover, the components of the magnetic stress tensor are small compared to those of the hydrodynamic stress tensor, and the contribution of magnetic fields to angular momentum transport is small at all times.

The time evolution of the magnetic field structure is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:timeseries] in the orbital plane (upper row) and perpendicular to it (lower row), centered on the companion. During the amplification phases, up to 20 d, the magnetic field strength increases in the accretion stream around the companion and the region of very strong magnetic fields (larger than 1/10 of the maximum field strength) is confined to about [formula] around the companion. At the end of the slow amplification phase (Fig. [\ref=fig:timeseries] at 20 d), the magnetic fields start to be advected through the envelope. At later times (Fig. [\ref=fig:timeseries] at 120 d), the magnetic field is dispersed throughout the envelope, reaching values of 10 to 100 kG in large parts of the envelope.

Comparison to MRI

The flow structure around the companion resembles an accretion flow with radially decreasing angular velocity Ω. In the presence of magnetic fields, such a configuration is unstable and subject to the magnetorotational instability (MRI, [\citealp=balbus1991a] [\citealp=balbus1995a]; for a review see [\citealp=balbus1998a]). During the linear phase, this instability leads to exponentially growing magnetic fields, finally ending in a saturated state due to non-linear interactions. The e-folding time during the growth phase is usually dominated by the fastest growing MRI channel [\citep=rembiasz2016a]; its growth time is given by [\citep=rembiasz2016a]

[formula]

and the associated wavenumber can be computed as [\citep=rembiasz2016a]

[formula]

where [formula] is the local rotational shear and [formula] the Alfvén velocity in z direction. The wavelength of the corresponding MRI channel is [formula]. In the simulations, q takes values of about 1, thus the flow is unstable to the MRI. The mean value of Ω around the companion rises to [formula] s- 1 during the first 0.5 d and then slowly declines to [formula] s- 1 at 25 d. The Alfvén velocity increases quickly at the beginning as the magnetic field is advected towards the companion and then further as the MRI operates. It reaches a maximum of [formula] cm s- 1 at 5 d.

In the simulations, the amplification of the magnetic fields starts when the fastest growing mode is resolved on the grid after 0.5 to 1 d, with the smallest grid cells having an effective radius of approximately [formula]. The e-folding time of the magnetic energy during the fast amplification phase between 0.5 and 2 d (Fig. [\ref=fig:ebtime], panel c) is about 0.05 d, which is similar to the timescale of the fastest growing MRI channel (between 0.05 and 0.2 d) as estimated as a mean value from the simulation using Eq. ([\ref=eq:tmri]). Since the flow structure in the simulation is not an idealized shearing box, no pure MRI channels are expected to emerge and estimates using the formulae above are only approximate.

During the evolution, the size of the fastest growing MRI channel increases due to an increase of the Alfvén velocity and at 1.5 d, it becomes larger than the accretion flow structure, which has a radius of about [formula]. Thus, the MRI can only operate on smaller wavelengths and longer growth times: the e-folding time of the magnetic energy during the slow amplification phase is about 3 d (see Tab. [\ref=tab:simulations] and Fig. [\ref=fig:ebtime], panel d), but the fastest MRI timescale [formula] at this point is about 1 d. It has increased because the angular velocity has decreased (cf. Eq. [\ref=eq:tmri]).

After 20 d, the growth of the magnetic energy stops and the system transitions to a saturation phase (Fig. [\ref=fig:ebtime], panel b). This may be attributed to a change in the flow structure: the accretion flow around the companion is disturbed by the interaction with the RG core because the separation is only [formula] at periapsis at this time. Possible reasons usually invoked for termination of the MRI include parasitic instabilities [\citep=goodman1994a]. Moreover, it is unclear what determines the level at which the magnetic fields saturate; this may depend on the system parameters such as the evolutionary state (e.g., RGB or AGB) or mass of the primary or the initial configuration of the system. As an additional test, we conducted a simulation with a smaller companion mass ([formula]), but otherwise identical initial conditions. In this run, the same saturation level of the magnetic energy is reached as for the [formula] companion, thus other factors are more important than the companion mass.

Discussion

The first MHD simulations of the CE phase show that magnetic fields are strongly amplified in the direct vicinity of the companion star on dynamical timescales during the spiral-in. The temporal and spatial scales are compatible with the MRI operating in the accretion flow around the companion. Although the magnetic field strength is increased by orders of magnitude, the dynamical impact is small: mass loss is slightly increased during the first orbit (about 5% to 6%), but the contribution to angular momentum and energy transport is not significant and the final separation of the stellar cores is very similar to that found in non-MHD simulations with the same initial parameters.

This is a new way of generating magnetic fields during the dynamical spiral-in of the CE phase compared to earlier investigations that assumed a dynamo operating in the differentially rotating envelope [\citep=regos1995a], in an accretion disk formed from the tidally disrupted companion [\citep=nordhaus2011a], or in the hot outer layers of the degenerate core [\citep=wickramasinghe2014a]. These processes, however, may still be important later in the evolution. We also stress that we only simulated a single system, and that a variety of systems undergoing a CE phase has to be simulated to understand the range of magnetic fields that can be generated during CE evolution.

Magnetic fields that vary on short timescales, as is the case in the simulations presented here, are difficult to anchor at the WD surface [\citep=potter2010a]. Moreover, the magnetic fields present in the simulations (10 to 100 kG) are smaller than the largest fields in WDs (up to 109 G, see [\citealp=ferrario2015b]). Thus, the dynamical amplification of magnetic fields during the spiral-in may not explain the formation of high-field magnetic WDs for the simulated CE phase of a [formula] RG. According to the population synthesis calculations by [\citet=briggs2015a], the largest contribution to high-field magnetic WDs comes from mergers during the CE phase of an AGB primary. Hence, such systems may be more promising for future studies.

RGs can be observed with mean magnetic fields down to 10 to 100 G, but all observed RGs with magnetic fields cluster at the base of the RG branch [\citep=auriere2015a]. Because it is difficult to compute the photosphere in our simulations, the magnetic field at the photosphere cannot be predicted from our simulations, and we postpone such an analysis to future studies. Nevertheless, CE events have been connected to luminous red novae [\citep=ivanova2013b], and the presence of magnetic fields in these events would support dynamical amplification during the spiral-in phase of a CE event.
