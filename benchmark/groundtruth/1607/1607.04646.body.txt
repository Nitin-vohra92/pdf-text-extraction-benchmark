Optimal and Secure Measurement Protocols for Quantum Sensor Networks

Entanglement is a valuable resource in precision measurement, as measurements using entangled probe systems have fundamentally higher optimal sensitivity [\cite=Bollinger1996] than those using product states. A generic measurement using N unentangled probes will have a standard deviation from the true value asymptotically proportional to [formula], while a measurement making full use of entanglement can improve this scaling to 1 / N. For measurement of a single parameter coupled indpendently to each probe system, this 1 / N (or "Heisenberg") scaling is the best possible that is consistent with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle [\cite=Wineland1992] [\cite=Bollinger1996]. The procedure can also be reversed-enhanced sensitivity to disturbances can provide experimental evidence of entanglement [\cite=Pezze2009] [\cite=Strobel2014] [\cite=Toth2012].

Measurements making use of entanglement usually couple one parameter to N different systems [\cite=Bollinger1996] [\cite=Dinani2016] [\cite=Kessler2014]. However, the emerging potential of long-range quantum information opens new avenues for metrology [\cite=Komar2014] [\cite=Komar2016] and entanglement distribution [\cite=Valivarthi2016]. The ability to distribute entanglement across spatially separated regions has already been used for recent loophole-free tests of Bell's inequality [\cite=Giustina2015b] [\cite=Shalm2015] [\cite=Hensen2015]. In this work, we are interested in coupling N parameters to N different systems, which may be spatially separated, and measuring a linear function of all of them (see Fig. [\ref=fig:setup]a), such as a single mode of a spatially varying field. Such measurements may be of interest in geodesy or geophysics [\cite=Nabighian2005] [\cite=Ding2013] [\cite=Wright2004] [\cite=Stacey1964].

The function q we wish to measure is a weighted sum of the individual parameters θi, where i indexes the individual systems and each weight is denoted by a known real number αi,

[formula]

In this paper, we characterize the advantage entanglement provides in this setting and construct an optimal strategy that amounts to turning some qubits' evolution "on" and "off" for time proportional to the weight with which their parameter contributes to the function q (see Fig. [\ref=fig:setup]b). With this scheme of "partial time evolution," we can measure a linear function with the minimum variance permitted by quantum mechanics, which can be viewed as an extension of the Heisenberg limit to multi-parameter problems. We will also show that our method can protect the secrecy of the result, allowing the network as a whole to perform a measurement without eavesdroppers learning any details of [formula].

It may seem surprising that the optimal measurement is one in which most qubits spend some of the measurement time idle. Since more time yields more signal, intuition suggests that the most effective strategy would make better measurements on the less-weighted qubits rather than keep them off for much of the measurement time. This reasoning fails because we assume absolutely no prior knowledge on the individual parameters. Consider attempting to measure θ1  +  θ2. If θ1 is known to high precision, but we lack any information about θ2, there is no way to use our certainty about θ1 to improve an estimate of θ1  +  θ2. Because we restrict ourselves to a state of ignorance about the individual parameters, only a measurement of the entire function is usable, and in this case our scheme is optimal.

Setup.--We consider a system in which there are N sensor stations. Each sensor station i possesses a single qubit coupled to an external parameter θi unique to each station. We suppose that the state as a whole evolves unitarily under the Hamiltonian

[formula]

Here, H̃(t) is a time-dependent control Hamiltonian chosen by us which may include coupling to additional ancilla qubits. We wish to measure a quantity q defined in Eq. [\eqref=eqn:qdef]. We assume that [formula], and additionally that there is at least one αi such that αi  =  1. These conditions simply set a scale for the function, and for an arbitrary [formula] all that is needed is division by the largest αi to meet this requirement. As an example, a network with two stations interested in measuring the contrast between those stations would set [formula] to measure θ1  -  θ2. We would like to establish how well an arbitrary measurement of [formula] can be made, and what the best measurement protocol is for doing so. By "protocol" we mean three different choices: (1) which input state we begin with, (2) what auxiliary control Hamiltonian H̃(t) we implement, and (3) how the final measurement is to be made.

We define the quality of measurement in terms of an estimator, Q, constructed from experimental data. (Throughout this paper, we denote operators with hats, quantities by lowercase, and corresponding estimators by uppercase.) We assume that the estimator is unbiased, so that its average value is the true value [formula]. Then our metric for the quality of the measurement is the average squared error, or variance, of the estimator,

[formula]

If measurements of θi can be made locally with accuracy [formula], then we could compute the linear combination by local measurements and classical computation. In this case, the variance is given by classical statistical theory as [formula], assuming that [formula] is identical at each site and equal to [formula]. A measurement of an individual frequency can be made with a variance of 1 / t2 [\cite=Wineland1992]. Therefore, our entanglement-free figure of merit is

[formula]

We consider this the standard quantum limit (SQL) for networks. To compare to the typical case where N independent qubits measure a single parameter, consider the average [formula], which is equivalent to setting all αi  =  1 and then using   =  Q / N to obtain [formula]. It is our goal in this paper to present a means to improve on this figure using entanglement.

Optimality.-Our task is to perform parameter estimation on a quantum system evolving under some set of parameters {θi} linearly coupled to sensor qubits as in Eq. [\eqref=eqn:hamiltonian] [\cite=Braunstein1996] [\cite=Paris2008] [\cite=Boixo2007] [\cite=Pang2014]. Note that even though we are only interested in measuring a single number, we still need to treat a system which has many parameters in the evolution, necessitating the use of a full multi-parameter theory as in Refs. [\cite=Baumgratz2015] [\cite=Crowley2014] [\cite=Gao2014] [\cite=Genoni2013] [\cite=Humphreys2013] [\cite=Kok2015] [\cite=Yue2014] [\cite=Zhang2014]. It is known from classical estimation theory that, given a probability distribution p(z) over a set of outcomes z that depends on a number of parameters, all estimators of the parameters obey the Cramér-Rao inequality [\cite=Helstrom1968] [\cite=Helstrom1969],

[formula]

Here, M is the number of experiments performed, F is the Fisher information matrix (see below), and Σ is the covariance matrix, where [formula]. The inequality is a matrix inequality, meaning that MΣ  -  F- 1 is positive semidefinite. We will concern ourselves with the single-shot Fisher information, and set M  =  1 from now on. The Fisher information matrix captures how each parameter changes the probability distribution of outcomes,

[formula]

This bound is a purely classical statement about probability distributions, and is saturated asymptotically using a maximum-likelihood estimator [\cite=Braunstein1994]. Quantum theory bounds the probability distributions which can result from a state evolved under a parameter-dependent unitary operation.

Our parameters in the Fisher information matrix F are the individual θi, while the quantity we want to estimate is some combination of these, [formula]. To formulate the appropriate Cramèr-Rao bound in this case, we write a new Fisher information matrix, G, where the parameters are recast in a new basis which includes [formula],

[formula]

Here, [formula] represents an element of a new set of N real vectors which span the entire N-dimensional space. We designate the first element of that set, [formula], as the [formula] we are interested in. The Cramèr-Rao bound on our quantity of interest is

[formula]

Using the chain rule, it can be shown that if we arrange the vectors [formula] into a matrix A such that Aij  =  α(i)j, F is related to G by the transformation F  =  ATGA. It then follows that [formula], so that

[formula]

Since F is positive semidefinite, [formula] is Hermitian. We can then write the following for an arbitrary real [formula] by invoking the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

[formula]

Taking [formula] to be the bth element of the standard basis gives

[formula]

Since Fbb is the Fisher information for a single parameter, for any H̃(t) including ancilla qubits, [formula] [\cite=Boixo2007], where [formula] is the operator seminorm of the generator corresponding to parameter θb. The seminorm is the difference between the largest and smallest eigenvalues of b. Our final bound comes from applying this condition and recognizing that the formula must hold for all b:

[formula]

In Eq. [\eqref=eqn:hamiltonian], all [formula], [formula], and we find a bound,

[formula]

Here we have also used the fact that the largest αi  =  1. If we want to calculate an average, then all qubits are equally weighted and the desired quantity is   =  q / N, so [formula] has the desired Heisenberg scaling. However, note that if we wanted to calculate only a single θi, then we would not scale coefficients at all. In this case, there is obviously no advantage from having more qubits. Our bound allows us to explore the full range of possible [formula] between these two extremes.

We can verify that the above argument is correct by optimizing over the space of all control Hamiltonians H̃(t). As this is computationally expensive, we limit ourselves to a two-qubit sensor network with no ancillas. The parameters we optimize over include enough operators to provide universal control on two qubits, meaning we can effectively modify the input state as well as the final measurement basis in order to optimize the Fisher information. In order to test the form of our bound Eq. [\eqref=eqn:generalbound], which depends both on relative weights of each parameter and the underlying generator, we couple θ1 to a generator σ̂z1, which has [formula], while leaving the second qubit coupled to a generator [formula] as in Eq. [\eqref=eqn:hamiltonian]. The bound corresponding to the first qubit from Eq. [\eqref=eqn:generalbound] is α21 / 4t2, and that of the second qubit is α22  /  t2. In our numerics, we set α1  =  t  =  1, meaning the two bounds are 1 / 4 and α22. Our analytic result leads us to believe therefore that if α22  >  1 / 4, the minimum possible variance should be α22. However, if α22  <  1 / 4, then the lower bound should be 1 / 4. That behavior is precisely what we find through brute force numerical optimization, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:graddescent], confirming Eq. [\eqref=eqn:generalbound].

Protocol.--We now present a protocol that saturates the bound of Eq. [\eqref=eqn:ptebound]. We start by considering an N-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state:

[formula]

Under σ̂z evolution, each [formula] accumulates a phase relative to [formula]. By allowing qubits to accumulate phase proportional to the desired weight αi, we can get a final state in which [formula] has accumulated a total phase of [formula] relative to [formula]. We refer to our protocol as "partial time evolution" because it relies on a qubit undergoing evolution for a fraction of the total measurement time. We can realize this by applying σ̂xi to a qubit at time [formula] so that the qubit evolution will be identical to evolving it for a time αit. Note that if there is a fixed experimental time t, this scheme can realize values of [formula], which motivates our restrictions on the values of individual αi.

The result of this protocol is an effective evolution according to the unitary operator

[formula]

Under this evolution, the final state is:

[formula]

Now we make a measurement of the overall parity of the state, [formula]. The details of this measurement and calculation of 〈P̂〉 are given in Ref. [\cite=Bollinger1996]. Measurement of the time-dependent expectation value 〈P̂〉(t) allows for the estimation of Q with accuracy [\cite=Wineland1994]

[formula]

saturating the bound in Eq. [\eqref=eqn:ptebound].

One advantage of this protocol is that an eavesdropper cannot learn the result of the network measurement by capturing a subset of the nodes' measurement results. This privacy can be shown by tracing out the first qubit in Eq. [\eqref=eqn:postptestate], which leaves no phase information in the resulting mixed state. The central node can receive the measurement outcomes from all other nodes but keep its own secret, and no eavesdropper is able to extract information from the broadcasted results, even if the central node's qubit is unweighted (i.e., αi  =  0).

Input States and Decoherence.--The perfect security of the GHZ state stems from the fact that a single lost qubit ruins the measurement, but this also manifests as extreme sensitivity to noise which can pose problems for metrology [\cite=Huelga1997] [\cite=Escher2011] [\cite=Vidrighin2014]. For this reason, it can be advantageous to use other entangled states that may be more robust to decoherence, although these will be generally less secure as well.

One option is to use spin-squeezed states, which have known advantages for precision measurement. These are collective spin states which, due to entanglement, have reduced variance of angular momentum along one axis at the cost of increased variance along an orthogonal axis [\cite=Kitagawa1993] [\cite=Wineland1992]. Recently, it has been shown that these states may allow Heisenberg scaling measurements even without single-particle detection, which makes them very attractive for experimental implementations [\cite=Davis2016a]. In particular, we consider a state whose overall spin vector is aligned along + x, such that [formula]. We assume that the other components of individual spin have zero expectation value, but that the variance of the collective spin projection [formula] is decreased while the variance of Ĵz is increased. We quantify this effect through the spin-squeezing parameter ξ [\cite=Wineland1992],

[formula]

Suppose that we perform Ramsey interferometry on such a state [\cite=Wineland1992] [\cite=Wineland1994]. The protocol includes both partial time evolution U(t) and a final rotation pulse [formula]. The final measurement will be of the total angular momentum projection Jz after applying these operations:

[formula]

If we specify that this expectation is to be taken over a squeezed state with [formula] and [formula], then our signal will be sensitive only to [formula] if each individual phase is small:

[formula]

This shows that a squeezed state can be used for measurement of heterogeneous parameters. The sensitivity can then be calculated just as before,

[formula]

We evaluate the sensitivity at q  =  0 because we are interested in small signals. Partial time evolution with spin-squeezed input beats the SQL if [formula]. Squeezed states can achieve squeezing proportional to N- 1 / 2 [\cite=Wineland1992] [\cite=Kitagawa1993], which approaches our bound in Eq. [\eqref=eqn:ptebound] up to numerical prefactors.

Other highly-entangled states such as Dicke states also have metrological value in the presence of noise and could also serve as input states to partial time evolution with similarly favorable scaling [\cite=Dicke1954] [\cite=Holland1993a] [\cite=Zhang2014] [\cite=Campbell2009] [\cite=Lucke2014]. Besides using other input states, techniques like dynamical decoupling [\cite=Viola1999] or quantum error correction could be explored in efforts to mitigate decoherence [\cite=Kessler2014a] [\cite=Lu2015].

Outlook.--We have presented a measurement protocol for quantum networks which is useful for measuring linear combinations of parameters. Measurement schemes which use many-body entangled states have been proposed for clocks [\cite=Huelga1997] [\cite=Kessler2014] [\cite=Louchet-Chauvet2010] and may also prove useful for atomic magnetometry [\cite=Sheng2013], gravimetry [\cite=DeAngelis2008] [\cite=Debs2011], spectroscopy [\cite=Dinani2016], and rotation sensing [\cite=Ragole2016] [\cite=Gustavson1997] [\cite=Kolkowitz2016]. While we focused on sensors distributed over long distances, there may also be applications at small scales. Recent experiments have used atomic magnetometers to detect animal neurons firing [\cite=Jensen2016] or perform MRI [\cite=Savukov2009]. Studying the spatial modes of these phenomena through the techniques presented here could prove valuable.

In future work, we also would like to quantify the power of a measurement in a Bayesian setting where a prior on individual θi exists, which will require more statistical sophistication. We hope to understand whether and how the existence of prior distributions opens up new measurement strategies beyond those presented here [\cite=Berry2015a] [\cite=Gill1995] [\cite=Gill2013].
