Spatially Resolved Fourier Transform Spectroscopy in the Extreme Ultraviolet

A well known feature of high-harmonic generation (HHG) are broadband spectra in the XUV and soft X-ray regions [\cite=krausz_attosecond_2009] [\cite=popmintchev_attosecond_2010] [\cite=lewenstein_theory_1994]. This radiation is typically emitted in a train of attosecond pulses with excellent spatial and temporal coherence, as shown in various interferometric and spectroscopic measurements [\cite=zerne_phase-locked_1997] [\cite=descamps_extreme_2000] [\cite=bellini_temporal_1998] [\cite=kandula_extreme_2010] [\cite=salieres_frequency-domain_1999]. As a result, interferometry with high harmonics found important applications in e.g. Molecular Orbital Tomography [\cite=Bertrand], in wavefront reconstruction [\cite=austin_lateral_2011] and electric field characterization [\cite=Wyatt] of high harmonics. Recently, interferometry with high harmonics provided added value to Coherent Diffractive Imaging [\cite=Witte_2014] [\cite=Meng] using the full high harmonics bandwidth and photon flux. However, in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range, interferometry and Fourier transform spectroscopy are challenging due to the high stability requirements of the interferometer itself. Two main types of HHG interferometers have been devised. In one scheme, the near-infrared fundamental driving pulse is split into two phase-locked pulses with an adjustable time delay, and this pulse pair is subsequently used for HHG [\cite=kovacev_extreme_2005]. Although this method has been successfully used it is typically limited by the stability of the optical interferometer. The other scheme is based on wavefront division, whereby one HHG beam is divided into two phase-locked sources by a piezo-mounted split mirror. This configuration allows more stable interferometry [\cite=nabekawa_interferometry_2009] [\cite=klisnick_experimental_2006] [\cite=de_oliveira_high-resolution_2011] [\cite=terschlusen_measuring_2014], but results in two beams with different spatial profiles and strong diffraction effects due to the hard edge of the split mirror. Wavefront division interferometry is also less flexible when one would like to change the intensity ratio between the two beams.

In this letter we present XUV interferometry using a novel ultrastable common-path interferometer with a timing stability better than 0.8 attoseconds (as) between two phase-locked high-harmonic sources. We characterize high-harmonic spectra from argon and and neon, and perform Fourier transform spectroscopy on a thin titanium/silicon nitride bilayer. Our approach combines the flexibility of near infrared (NIR) interferometers with the stability of common-path techniques. Because no XUV optics are involved the only bandwidth limitation is the phase-matching bandwidth of the HHG process, which can span more than an octave [\cite=popmintchev_attosecond_2010].

In our experiments we use a Ti:Sapphire seeded noncollinear optical parametric chirped-pulse amplifier (NOPCPA) [\cite=witte_ultrafast_2012]. The pump laser for this system delivers 80 mJ, 532 nm pulses with a duration of 64 ps at 300 Hz [\cite=noom_high-energy_2013]. The output of the NOPCPA is compressed to pulses of approximately 20 fs duration and an energy of 5 mJ.These pulses are then directed into our common-path interferometer, which is schematically displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig:full_setup](a). The phase-locked pulse pair is produced in birefringent wedges, where the optical axis is oriented at 45[formula] with respect to the input polarization [\cite=brida_phase-locked_2012] [\cite=oriana_FT_vis_2016]. This pair of wedges splits the input pulse into two parts of equal intensity but with orthogonal polarization, and introduces a delay of several picoseconds between the two electric field components. The second pair of wedges has its optical axis perpendicular to the first pair, thus providing an opposite delay compared to the first pair of wedges. The exact remaining delay can be controlled by moving one of the wedges perpendicular to the beam. The final delay depends linearly on the wedge displacement Δx and is given by [formula], where Δn  =  ne  -  no is the difference in refractive index for the extraordinary and ordinary polarization states, c is the speed of light in vacuum and [formula] is the apex angle of the wedges. We use α-BBO crystals in the interferometer because of their strong birefringence (Δn  =  0.11 at 800 nm) and low nonlinear susceptibility. Behind the second pair of wedges we use an ultrabroadband thin-film polarizer to project the pulses onto the same polarization axis. The resulting pulse pair is vertically polarized and contains up to 1 mJ per pulse. The intensity ratio between the beams can be controlled by tuning the input polarization state with a half-wave plate. Using a piezo-controlled translation stage, we can scan the time delay with attosecond accuracy over a range of 50 fs. The resolution of the piezo stage is specified to be 5 nm, which in principle enables a sub-attosecond resolution of the delay between the HHG pulses. Behind the interferometer, a lens (f = 25 cm) focuses the pulses into a gas jet for high-harmonic generation, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:full_setup](b). The gas is supplied by a pulsed piezo valve (developed by M.H.M. Janssen, Vrije Universiteit) and guided through a small tube with 1.4 mm inner diameter. The light is focused through a 0.5 mm aperture drilled perpendicular to the tube axis. By tilting the last wedge of the interferometer, we ensure that the focal spots of the two pulses are separated by about 300 μm in the focal plane, which is a distance several times larger than the focused beam diameter. This separation ensures that the two pulses generate high harmonics independently, as any partial overlap could lead to delay-dependent interference effects between the pulses, which in turn would affect ionization and phase matching. Behind the HHG chamber we use an aluminium filter in combination with a 1 mm diameter aperture to separate the XUV from the driving NIR radiation. The XUV beams overlap and interfere in the far field, where we use an XUV-sensitive CCD camera (Andor iKon-L) to record the interference patterns. Examples of the measured interference patterns are given in Figs. [\ref=fig:full_setup](c,d). The beams interfere at a relative angle of 0.4 mrad, leading to multiple zones of straight fringes with a high visibility. The spatial mode profile of the individual HHG beams has a smooth Gaussian shape. Some slight diffraction features can be observed at the edges caused by the aperture in the beam path. A spatial Fourier transform of an interference pattern at a fixed delay directly yields an HHG spectrum [\cite=padget_staticFT_1995], as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:sfft](a), which is possible because of the near-diffraction-limited beam profile of the individual HHG beams. Although this spectrum is limited in resolution due to the small angle, the individual harmonics are still clearly resolved. This spatial transform is useful as a single-shot diagnostic of the high harmonics spectrum. A further advantage is that these individual harmonic peaks contain information on the delay between the pulses. The change in delay between two images can be calibrated from these measurements by evaluating the phase delay of the individual harmonic peaks as a function of time delay. The extracted phase for a single harmonic vs. stage position is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:sfft](b), and confirms the scan linearity of our interferometer. In addition, the intensity of the particularly selected harmonic extracted from the interferogram is also plotted. By calculating the phase delay per stage step and dividing by the central angular frequency of the harmonic, we obtain the time delay per step (Fig. [\ref=fig:sfft](c)), as well as a measurement of the interferometer stability. By considering this data for the high-amplitude range of the scan between 60 and 95 μm, we find a timing stability of 0.8 attoseconds (standard deviation) or equivalently 0.25 nm optical path length stability, limited by the precision of the phase determination in the spatial Fourier transform. It is worth noting that this stability includes the effects of possible differential phase shifts between the two separated HHG zones. Small intensity variations could in principle lead to phase shifts between the harmonic beams if the driving pulses are not identical [\cite=bellini_temporal_1998], but the present measurement shows that this effect is not a limiting factor for HHG-based FTS for our parameters. With the achieved stability, simulations show that FTS is feasible even at wavelengths well below 10 nm [\cite=Witte_2014].

Scanning the time delay between the pulses, the HHG spectrum can be measured accurately by Fourier transform spectroscopy. We recorded such Fourier scans of high harmonics generated in argon and neon. In FTS, the step size should be less than half of the shortest wavelength in the source spectrum, and the obtained spectral resolution is determined by the length of the scan. We typically record up to a thousand images with a step size of 15 as. To remove the influence of intensity fluctuations in the recorded interference patterns (caused by laser power or beam pointing variations) and subsequently improve the signal-to-noise ratio, we normalized the spatial interference patterns to a selected local area in the beam. Finally, a spectrum for every pixel is acquired by Fourier transforming the measured data along the time axis. Fig. [\ref=fig:spectra] shows temporal interferograms for single pixels and the corresponding HHG spectra. As the interference pattern will only show those spectral components that are present in both beams, both driving pulses should produce identical HHG spectra, which has been confirmed using a conventional grazing-incidence grating XUV spectrometer. The interferograms in Figs. [\ref=fig:spectra](a,b) and Figs. [\ref=fig:spectra](d,e) contain two clear timescales, corresponding to the coherence times of the individual attosecond pulses and the complete attosecond pulse train, respectively. For the short coherence time, we obtain (396 ±   10) as (Ar) and (115 ±   6) as (Ne), which reflects the about 3.5 times broader spectrum of HHG from Ne compared to Ar. On the other hand, the long coherence times are (11.9 ±   0.3) fs (Ar) and (6.0 ±   0.6) fs (Ne) indicating that high harmonics in Ne are produced by the most intense temporal part of the laser pulse. In contrast to a grating spectrometer, the frequency resolution in FTS is constant over the full spectrum, which amounts to 80 THz for the example shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:spectra](c). Expressed as a fraction of the wavelength, this means a resolution of 1 in 200 for the highest harmonic orders versus 1 in 100 for the longer wavelengths. In our current interferometer we can scan up to 50 fs in time delay, which corresponds to a potential resolution of 1 in 900 for the highest harmonic orders. This scan range can easily be extended by increasing the travel range of the piezo stage and the size of the wedges. This flexibility of the spectral range and resolution are clear advantages of FTS as a spectroscopic technique.

In addition to the spectral and spatial characterization of the HHG beam itself, our method can also be applied to perform spectroscopy on spatially complex samples. We explore this option by measuring the transmission spectrum of a 20 nm thin titanium film grown by electron beam evaporation on a 15 nm thin silicon nitride membrane. The silicon membrane contains a 100 µm diameter aperture near one side (Fig. [\ref=fig:foil](a)). With spatially resolved FTS we can simultaneously measure the XUV spectrum transmitted through the bilayer and through the aperture, a measurement that would be challenging to perform with grating-based spectrometers. We used the spectrum transmitted through the aperture as a reference for a direct determination of the relative absorption spectrum of the bilayer. The titanium sample was positioned in the XUV beam ensuring that both XUV pulses were overlapping on the sample. A typical transmission spectrum is given in Fig. [\ref=fig:foil](a). A single Fourier scan yields spectra for the transmission of both the aperture and the titanium thin film (Fig. [\ref=fig:foil](b)). The spectrum transmitted by the bilayer shows a clear dip around 25 nm matching with the corresponding absorption band of titanium. Comparing the strength of the harmonics in both spectra yields the spectral transmission of the combined titanium and silicon nitride layer, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:foil](b). The measured transmission matches with the expected transmission of an 18 nm titanium layer on top of a 16 nm layer of silicon nitride [\cite=cxro]. Potentially, there could be a thin titanium oxide layer on top of the titanium film, but given the small difference in XUV absorption this distinction cannot be made.

In summary, we have demonstrated XUV interferometry and Fourier transform spectroscopy without the need for XUV optics. Using a birefringence-based common-path interferometer, we achieve sub-attosecond timing stability and a high spectral resolution. With two HHG pulses from neon gas, we measure more than octave-spanning HHG spectra ranging from 17 to 55 nm wavelength and find that the HHG process adds less than 0.8 as relative timing jitter under our experimental conditions. We demonstrate that our FTS method can be used to measure the absorption spectrum of a spatially inhomogeneous thin film sample. For future experiments it is particularly promising to combine this method with Coherent Diffractive Imaging on nanostructures composed of multiple materials.
