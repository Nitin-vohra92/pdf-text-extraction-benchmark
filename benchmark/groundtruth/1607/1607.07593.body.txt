Introduction, main result and plan of the paper

Introduction and main result

Let [formula] be a smooth closed strictly convex curve. Let S denote the complement of the ambient plane [formula] to the closure of the interior of the curve C. The (planar) outer billiard is a dynamical system T:S  →  S defined as follows. Pick a point A∈S. There are two tangent rays to C issued from the point A. Let R denote the right tangent ray: the other tangent ray is obtained from R by rotation around the point A of angle between zero and π. Let P denote the tangency point of the ray R with the curve C. By definition, the image T(A) is the point of the ray R that is symmetric to A with respect to the point P.

A planar outer billiard is polynomially integrable, if there exists a polynomial f(x,y) (called a first integral) whose level curves are invariant under the outer billiard mapping.

For a survey on outer billiards see [\cite=tab95] [\cite=tab05] [\cite=tabdog].

The main result of the paper is the following theorem.

Let a planar outer billiard on a C4-smooth strictly convex closed curve C be polynomially integrable. Then C is an ellipse.

A particular case of Theorem [\ref=tab] under a non-degeneracy assumption on the polynomial integral was proved by S.L.Tabachnikov [\cite=tab08]. Analogous statement for polynomially integrable Birkhoff billiards under assumption that the complexification of the curve C is nonsingular was proved by S.V.Bolotin in [\cite=bolotin]. For a survey and recent results on polynomially integrable Birkhoff billiards see [\cite=bm] and references therein.

We also prove the following more general theorems. First, instead of strictly convex closed (hence, bounded) curves we can consider a (non-closed) unbounded convex connected curve [formula]. In general the corresponding outer billiard mapping is well-defined not on the whole exterior domain, but on some smaller domain. The above definition of polynomial integrability also makes sense in this case.

If C is a parabola, then the corresponding outer billiard mapping is defined in the whole exterior domain. But if C is a branch of a hyperbola, then the set of those points A for which there exist two tangent lines to C through A is the domain bounded by the branch C and its asymptotic lines at infinity. This is the intersection of the definition domains of the corresponding outer billiard mapping and its inverse.

Let [formula] be a C4-smooth strictly convex curve that is either closed or unbounded. Let the corresponding outer billiard be polynomially integrable. Then the curve C lies in a conic.

The next theorem deals with non-convex curves C, for which the outer billiard mapping is just a multivalued correspondence.

A Ck-smoothly immersed curve [formula] generates a polynomially integrable multivalued outer billiard, if there exists a polynomial f(x,y) such that for every P∈C and every A,B∈TPC symmetric with respect to the point P one has f(A) = f(B). The latter polynomial is called an integral of the multivalued outer billiard constructed on the curve C.

Let [formula] be a C4-smoothly immersed image of either an interval, or a circle, and let C have no rectilinear arcs. Let C generate a polynomially integrable multivalued outer billiard. Then the curve C lies in a conic.

Theorem [\ref=tabinf] follows from Theorem [\ref=tabmult]. Theorem [\ref=tab] follows from Theorem [\ref=tabinf]. Thus, it suffices to prove Theorem [\ref=tabmult].

Let a smooth connected curve [formula] generate a polynomially integrable multivalued outer billiard with the integral f(x,y). Then one has [formula], analogously to [\cite=tab08]; in particular, C is contained in an algebraic curve. Indeed, let P∈C be a regular point of quadratic tangency. Then for every given k and every point A1∈TPC close enough to P (dependently on k) there exists a piecewise linear curve [formula] whose edges AjAj + 1 are small and tangent to C at their middle-points. (This is an orbit of the point A1 under appropriate branch of the outer billiard mapping.) One has [formula], by definition. As A1 becomes close to P, the latter orbits with growing lengths k limit to a strictly convex arc containing P of the curve C. Passing to limit, one gets f = const along every strictly convex arc. The constance of the polynomial f along each rectilinear arc of the curve C follows immediately from definition. This together with density of the union of the strictly convex part of the curve C and its rectilinear pieces and connectivity implies that [formula].

Let a curve C generate a polynomially integrable multivalued outer billiard with polynomial integral f. Let C have a bitangent: there exist a line L that is tangent to C at two distinct points P1 and P2. Then [formula]. Indeed, the restriction f|L should be constant on each orbit of the group generated by the symmetries with respect to the points P1 and P2. The product of the latter symmetries is a nontrivial translation, whose orbit is infinite. Thus, the polynomial f is constant on an infinite subset of the line L, and hence, on all of L.

Complexification and relative symmetry property. Plan of the proof of Theorem [\ref=tabmult]

Consider the complexification [formula] of the real plane and the ambient projective plane [formula]. Let [formula] denote the infinity line:

[formula]

Let a curve [formula] generate a polynomially integrable multivalued outer billiard with the integral f(x,y). Then [formula], by Remark [\ref=f=c]. We can and will consider that [formula], adding a constant to f. Then for every point P∈C the intersection [formula] is symmetric with respect to the point P, since the values of the polynomial f at symmetric points of the tangent line coincide by assumption. This motivates the following definition.

A complex algebraic curve [formula] has a relative symmetry property, if there exists a bigger algebraic curve Γ  ⊃  γ such that for every [formula] the intersection [formula] is symmetric with respect to the point t as a subset of the affine complex line [formula]: it is invariant under the central symmetry x  ↦   - x in affine coordinate x on Ttγ centered at t.

Let a smoothly immersed curve [formula] generate a polynomially integrable multivalued outer billiard with the integral f, [formula]. Let [formula] denote the minimal complex algebraic curve containing C. Let Γ  ⊃  γ denote the complexification of the algebraic curve {f = 0}. Then the curve γ has relative symmetry property with respect to the curve Γ, by the analogous statement in the real domain given at the beginning of the subsection.

An algebraic curve [formula] has the relative symmetry property with respect to an algebraic curve Γ  ⊃  γ, if and only if so does each of its irreducible components. If in the above example the curve C is analytic non-singular, then the curve γ is irreducible.

Let a smoothly immersed curve [formula] without rectilinear pieces generate a polynomially integrable multivalued outer billiard. Let [formula] be the minimal complex algebraic curve containing C. Then the curve γ has neither singular, nor inflection points in the affine plane [formula].

A particular case of Theorem [\ref=relsym] was proved by S. Tabachnikov in [\cite=tab08]. M. Bialy and A. E. Mironov have extended his proof to the general case by using their ideas from [\cite=bm]. This proof of Theorem [\ref=relsym] due to Tabachnikov, Bialy, and Mironov will be given in Section 1.2.

We will also deal with the local version of the relative symmetry property.

Let [formula], [formula] be an irreducible germ of an analytic curve at A, and let b be not a line. The germ b has a (local) relative symmetry property, if there exists a bigger finite union Γ  ⊃  b of irreducible germs of analytic curves at points of the tangent line [formula] such that for every t∈b close enough to A the intersection [formula] is symmetric with respect to the point t in the above sense.

In the conditions of Definition [\ref=def1] each local branch of the curve γ at every point has the local symmetry property.

Consider an irreducible nonlinear germ b of an analytic curve in [formula] at a given point A. Let us choose affine coordinates (z,w) centered at A so that the tangent line TAb be the z-axis. Then one can find a local bijective parametrization of the germ b by a complex parameter [formula] of the type

[formula]

[formula]

The projective Puiseux exponent [\cite=alg] of the germ b is the ratio

[formula]

The germ b is called quadratic, if rb = 2, and is called subquadratic, if [formula].

Let a nonlinear irreducible germ b of an analytic curve in [formula] at a point [formula] be transverse to [formula] and have the local relative symmetry property. Then it is quadratic.

Theorem [\ref=tsym] is proved in Section 2.

Let a nonlinear irreducible germ b of an analytic curve in [formula] at a point [formula] lie in the complexification of a real curve defining a polynomially integrable (multivalued) outer billiard. Then b is quadratic.

The corollary follows from the statements of Examples [\ref=exsym], [\ref=everybr] and Theorem [\ref=tsym].

Let an irreducible algebraic curve [formula] have neither singular, nor inflection points in an affine chart [formula]. Let each of its local branches at every point in [formula] that is transverse to [formula] be subquadratic. Then γ is a conic.

Theorem [\ref=shust] is proved in Section 3.

Let [formula] be an irreducible algebraic curve distinct from a line such that all its singular and inflection points (if any) lie in the infinity line. Let each local branch β of γ at every point in [formula] that is transverse to the infinity line [formula] have the local relative symmetry property with respect to some collection of germs Γ  =  Γ(β). Then γ is a conic.

Each local branch β as above is quadratic (Theorem [\ref=tsym]). Hence, γ is a conic, by Theorem [\ref=shust].

Each irreducible component of the complexification γ of the curve C has relative symmetry property and neither singular, nor inflection points in [formula], by Theorem [\ref=relsym]. Hence, it is a conic, by Corollary [\ref=corconic]. Thus, γ is a finite union of conics. This implies that in the case, when the curve C is analytic nonsingular, the curve γ is irreducible (just one conic) and hence, C lies in a conic. In the general case the curve C is a union of arcs of a finite number of conics. Any two adjacent arcs are tangent with tangency order at least 5, since the curve C is C4-smooth. Therefore, they lie in the same conic. Indeed, any two conics tangent to each other with tangency contact of order at least 5 coincide: otherwise, they would be two distinct conics with intersection index at least 5, which is obviously impossible. Hence, C lies in just one conic. Theorem [\ref=tabmult] is proved.

Singularities and inflection points. Proof of Theorem [\ref=relsym]

Here we repeat S.Tabachnikov's arguments from [\cite=tab08] modified by M.Bialy and A.Mironov using their ideas from [\cite=bm].

Let f be a polynomial integral. Let α  ⊂  γ be an irreducible component of the curve γ. Let (x,y) be affine coordinates on [formula]. Then for every P∈α and every two points A,B∈TPα symmetric with respect to the point P one has f(A) = f(B): this equality holds in the real domain (by definition) and extends analytically to the complex domain.

Let Ψ be an irreducible polynomial vanishing on α. Then

[formula]

Set

[formula]

The function F is multivalued algebraic, and any two of its leaves differ by multiplication by m-th root of unity. Its branching locus is contained in the curve {g = 0}. For every P, A, B as above one has F(A) = F(B) for appropriate choice of leaves of the multivalued function F. Namely, this holds for every P∉{g = 0}, any leaf of the function F analytic in a neighborhood of the point P, and any two points A,B∈TPα symmetric with respect to P and close enough to it.

Consider the (multivalued) vector field [formula], which is tangent to the level curves of the function F and does not vanish identically on α. The above symmetry is equivalent to the statement that the function

[formula]

is even in ε for all P = (x,y)∈α. Equivalently, its Taylor series should contain only even powers of the variable ε. The linear term in ε obviously vanishes. The first nontrivial condition is vanishing of the cubic coefficient, which takes the form

[formula]

We claim that vanishing of the expression W(F) implies the statements of Theorem [\ref=relsym]. To show that, let us consider the function

[formula]

which is equal to the coefficient at ε2 in U multiplied by two. One has

[formula]

as in [\cite=tab08]. (This can be proved by straightforward calculation.) This together with ([\ref=wf]) implies that

[formula]

Claim. [formula], as P∈α tends to either a finite singular point of the curve γ, or a finite inflection point of the curve α.

The expression H(F)(P) is the second derivative of the function ([\ref=fxy]) in ε. That is, the second derivative of the function F at P along the constant vector field on TPα given by the vector v. Let us show that the function U(x,y,ε) from ([\ref=fxy]) has asymptotics o(ε2), as [formula] and P tends to a point Q∈α that is either a finite singular point of the curve γ, or a finite inflection point of the curve α. This implies that [formula], as P  →  Q and will prove the claim.

Case 1): Q is a singular point of the curve γ. Then either g(Q) = 0, or Q is a cusp of the curve α and [formula]. In both cases [formula]. One has Ψ(P + εv) = O(ε2v2) = o(ε2), as P  →  Q along the curve α and [formula], since v is tangent to the zero level curve α of the polynomial Ψ. Therefore, U(x,y,ε) = (gΨ)((x,y) + εv) = o(ε2).

Case 2): Q is a finite inflection point of the curve α that is nonsingular for the curve γ. Then Ψ(P + εv) = o(ε2), as P  →  Q, and the function F and the field v are analytic on a neighborhood of the point Q. Therefore, U(x,y,ε) = o(ε2), as in the above case. The claim is proved.

Suppose, by contradiction, that the affine curve [formula] contains either its inflection point, or a singular point of the curve γ. Then [formula], by ([\ref=hconst]) and the claim. Therefore, α is a straight line. Hence, the real curve C contains a rectilinear segment. The contradiction thus obtained proves Theorem [\ref=relsym].

Quadraticity of germ. Proof of Theorem [\ref=tsym]

Plan of the proof of Theorem [\ref=tsym]

Let us introduce affine coordinates (x,y) on [formula] so that the x-axis be tangent to b at A. The symmetry property implies that for every t∈b close enough to A the union of x-coordinates of the points of intersection [formula] is invariant under the symmetry [formula] with respect to the point x(t). In Subsection 2.2 we will write explicit formulas for the asymptotics of the x-coordinates of the intersection points of Ttb with the germs at A of the curve Γ (Corollaries [\ref=cortr] and [\ref=casym]). For intersections with the germs tangent to b, these formulas were basically obtained in [\cite=alg]. Most of the next briefly discussed asymptotic results follow from them. Afterwards in Subsection 2.3 we study those points of intersection [formula] whose x-coordinates are of order νx(t), where ν is a nonzero multiplicative constant depending on the family of intersection points. The above-mentioned corollaries imply that the latter intersection points lie in the intersection of the line Ttb with those irreducible germs (a,A)  ⊂  Γ tangent to b, for which ra  ≥  rb = r. The intersections with those irreducible tangent germs (ai,A)  ⊂  Γ that have the same projective Puiseux exponent [formula] have x-coordinates asymptotically equivalent to θqaiijx(t), where θij are roots of the polynomial Wi(θ) = (r - 1)θpai - rθpai - qai + ci, [formula]; [formula]. In at least one of these polynomials, one has ci = 1: in the polynomial Wi corresponding to ai = b, i.e., to the intersection [formula].

We prove Theorem [\ref=tsym] by contradiction. The contrary assumption [formula] is equivalent to the statement that the qai-th powers of roots of each individual polynomial Wi are not all equal to one. Those intersection points with the germs ai that correspond to θqaiij = 2 (and only them) should be symmetric to those points of intersection [formula] whose x-coordinates are o(x(t)). For every family ξ(t) of intersection points of the line Ttb with a germ (a,A) tangent to b with ra > rb such that x(ξ(t)) = νx(t)(1 + o(1)), [formula], one has [formula] (Corollary [\ref=casym]). Therefore, the latter intersection points should be symmetric to those points of intersection of the line Ttb with the germs ai that correspond to [formula]. Let k1 and k2 denote the numbers of those roots θij whose qai-th powers are equal to 2 and [formula] respectively. The collection of the powers [formula] is symmetric with respect to 1, by the above statements. Hence, their sum equals their cardinality. This implies an explicit relation on k1, k2 and the sum of qai-th powers of all the roots θij through all i and j. We show that the latter relation is impossible, whenever [formula], by applying an explicit formula for the sum of powers of roots of each individual polynomial Wi (elementary algebra). This will prove Theorem [\ref=tsym].

Asymptotics of intersection points

Let a, b be transverse irreducible germs of holomorphic curves at the origin in [formula]. Let (z,w) be coordinates in a neighborhood of the origin in [formula] centered at 0 such that b is tangent to the z-axis at 0. Let  t be the local parameter of the curve b as in ([\ref=curve]): z(t) = tqb; w(t) = cbtpb(1 + o(1)). Then for every t small enough the intersection [formula] consists of qa points [formula] whose coordinates have the following asymptotics, as [formula]:

[formula]

It suffices to prove just the second asymptotic formula in ([\ref=zwb]). Indeed, one has z(ξj) = O(w(ξj)), by transversality. This together with the second formula in ([\ref=zwb]) implies the first one: z(ξj) = O(w(t)) = O(tpb).

For every t small enough the tangent line Ttb intersects the z-axis at a point Pt with the coordinate

[formula]

by [\cite=alg]. Let Qt denote the intersection point of the line Ttb with the w-axis. One has

[formula]

Indeed, the triangle with the vertices Pt, t, (z(t),0) is "complex-similar" to the triangle PtQtO (O is the origin), since their sides opposite to the vertex Pt lie in parallel affine complex lines. That is, in the new affine coordinates centered at Pt the second triangle is obtained from the first one by multiplication by the complex number [formula], see ([\ref=zpt]). This implies ([\ref=trisim]). Let now a be an arbitrary irreducible germ of holomorphic curve at the origin that is transverse to b. Every family of points ζ(t) of the intersection [formula] has w-coordinate asymptotically equivalent to w(Qt), by transversality and since the line Ttb = Qtζ(t) tends to the z-axis. This together with ([\ref=trisim]) proves the second equality in ([\ref=zwb]). The proposition is proved.

Let [formula], and let [formula] be an irreducible germ of an analytic curve that is transverse to [formula]. Let (a,A) be another irreducible germ transverse to b, and let [formula], ξj  =  ξj(t) be the points of intersection [formula]. Let (x,y) be affine coordinates in [formula] such that the x-axis is tangent to b at A. Then

[formula]

Take the local coordinates [formula] centered at A and apply the first formula in ([\ref=zwb]).

(cf. [\cite=alg]) Let a, b be irreducible germs of holomorphic curves at the origin in the plane [formula] with coordinates (z,w) that are tangent to the z-axis. Let ca and cb be the corresponding coefficients in ([\ref=curve]). Then for every t small enough the intersection [formula] consists of pa points [formula] whose z-coordinates have the following asymptotics, as [formula].

Case 1): ra > rb. One has

[formula]

[formula]

Case 2): ra = rb. One has

[formula]

where ζj are the roots of the polynomial

[formula]

(In the case, when b = a, one has c = 1, and the above polynomial has the double root 1 corresponding to the tangency point t.)

Case 3): ra < rb. One has

[formula]

All the statements of the proposition were proved in loc. cit. except for the statement saying that in Case 1) one has exactly qa intersection points with asymptotics ([\ref=a>b1]) and exactly pa - qa intersection points with asymptotics ([\ref=a>b2]). Let us prove the latter statement. Thus, we consider that ra > rb. Let τ denote the value of the local parameter of the curve a at a point of intersection [formula]. The obvious analytic equality

[formula]

has asymptotic form

[formula]

[formula], as in [\cite=alg]. The Newton diagram of the germ of analytic function G(t,τ) is generated by the three monomials: (1 - rb)tpb, rbtpb - qbτqa, - cτpa. It consists of two edges: the first one with the vertices (pb,0) and (pb - qb,qa); the second one with the vertices (pb - qb,qa) and (0,pa). The latter edges lie on distinct lines. The three above statements on Newton diagram follow from the inequality ra > rb, as in loc. cit. The germ of analytic curve [formula] at the origin is a union of two germs [formula] corresponding to the edges of the Newton diagram, as in loc. cit. Namely, the monomials (1 - rb)tpb and rbtpb - qbτqa generating the first edge are asymptotically opposite (asymptotically "cancel out") along the germ η1, and all the other Taylor monomials of the function G are of higher order along η1, as in loc. cit. This implies that for every fixed small t there are exactly qa parameter values τ for which (t,τ)∈η1, and they satisfy asymptotic equality ([\ref=a>b1]). Similarly, the monomials rbtpb - qbτqa and - cτpa are asymptotically opposite along the germ η2, and for every fixed small t there are exactly pa - qa values τ such that (t,τ)∈η2, and they satisfy asymptotic equality ([\ref=a>b2]). Proposition [\ref=asym] is proved.

Let [formula] be irreducible germs of holomorphic curves at a point [formula] that are tangent to each other and transverse to [formula]. Let (x,y) be affine coordinates on [formula] with the x-axis being tangent to b at A. Let [formula], ξj  =  ξj(t) be the points of intersection [formula]. Their x-coordinates have the following asymptotics, as t  →  A:

Case 1): ra > rb. One has

[formula]

[formula]

Case 2): ra = rb. One has

[formula]

where θj are the roots of the polynomial

[formula]

[formula]

Case 3): ra < rb. One has

[formula]

The corollary follows from Proposition [\ref=asym] by writing its asymptotics in the local coordinates [formula].

Intersections with the germs having the same projective Puiseux exponents. Proof of Theorem [\ref=tsym]

Let [formula], and let b be an irreducible germ of analytic curve at A that is transverse to [formula]. Let Γ  ⊃  b be an arbitrary finite union of germs of analytic curves at points of the line TAb including b.

Those points of intersection [formula] whose x-coordinates are asymptotically equivalent to x(t) times a nonzero multiplicative constant lie in the intersection of the line Ttb with those irreducible germs (a,A)  ⊂  Γ tangent to b for which ra  ≥  rb. The asymptotics of their x-coordinates are given by either ([\ref=a>b1*]) if ra > rb, or ([\ref=a=b*]) if ra = rb.

The proposition follows immediately from Corollaries [\ref=cortr] and [\ref=casym].

In what follows we assume that the curve b has relative symmetry property with respect to the curve Γ. First we prove Theorem [\ref=tsym] in the next simplest special case and then in the general case.

Special case: [formula] is a union of germs at A transverse to b. Let us prove quadraticity of the germ b. To do this, we consider those intersection points of the tangent line Ttb with Γ, whose x-coordinates have asymptotics νx(t)(1 + o(1)), [formula], as t  →  A. These are exactly the points of the intersection [formula] (Proposition [\ref=asynt]). Their x-coordinates have asymptotics θqjx(t)(1 + o(1)), where [formula] are the roots of the polynomial W(θ) = Qp,q,1(θ) = (r - 1)θp - rθp - q + 1; here p = pb and q = qb are the degrees from the parametrization ([\ref=curve]) of the germ b (Corollary [\ref=casym]). The intersection points of the line Ttb with the other, transverse germs of the curve Γ have x-coordinates with bigger asymptotics, by Corollary [\ref=cortr]. This together with the relative symmetry property implies that the collection of x-coordinates of the points of intersection [formula] is invariant under the symmetry with respect to the point x(t). This implies that the collection of powers θqj is invariant under the symmetry with respect to 1. Therefore,

[formula]

by symmetry. On the other hand,

[formula]

Indeed, the latter sum is independent of the free term of the polynomial W, being expressed via elementary symmetric polynomials of degrees at most q < p, which are independent of the free term. Therefore, it equals the sum of the q-th powers of nonzero roots of the polynomial (r - 1)θp - rθp - q. All the latter q-th powers are equal to [formula], hence their sum equals [formula]. This proves ([\ref=sumtq]). Formulas ([\ref=sumtp]) and ([\ref=sumtq]) together imply that [formula]. Hence, r = 2. Theorem [\ref=tsym] is proved.

General case. Let [formula] be the irreducible germs at A that are tangent to b and have the same projective Puiseux exponent: rai = rb = r. Let qai, pai, cai be the corresponding degrees and coefficients from their parametrizations ([\ref=curve]) in the local chart [formula]. Let

[formula]

be the corresponding constants and polynomials from ([\ref=rpq*]). Let θij, [formula], [formula] denote the roots of the polynomials Wi.

Let k1 denote the number of those points ξ(t) of intersection [formula], for which x(ξ(t)) = o(x(t)), as t  →  A. Let k2 denote the number of points of intersection of the line Ttb with the union of those irreducible germs at A in Γ that are tangent to b and have projective Puiseux exponent bigger than r = rb.

Let [formula]. The collection of powers θqaiij of the above roots contains exactly k1 powers equal to 2 and exactly k2 powers equal to [formula]. The collection M of the other powers [formula] is invariant under the symmetry of the line [formula] with respect to 1.

The points of intersection [formula] whose x-coordinates are o(x(t)) should be symmetric with respect to t to other intersection points with x-coordinates asymptotically equivalent to 2x(t) and vice versa. The latter should be points of intersection with the germs ai. This follows from Proposition [\ref=asynt] and the fact that they cannot be points of intersection with germs a having ra > r. The latter statement follows from ([\ref=a>b1*]) and the inequality [formula], which follows from the assumption that [formula]. This together with Corollary [\ref=casym] and Proposition [\ref=asynt] implies that exactly k1 powers θqaiij are equal to 2. Similarly, the points of intersection of the line Ttb with germs (a,A) tangent to b and having ra > r have x-coordinates asymptotic to [formula], by ([\ref=a>b1*]). Vice versa, the points of intersection [formula] with the latter asymptotics are the intersection points of the line Ttb with the germs (a,A), ra > r, tangent to b. This follows from Corollary [\ref=casym], Proposition [\ref=asynt] and the fact that they cannot be points of intersection with the germs ai: no number [formula] can be a root of a polynomial Wi with [formula]. Indeed,

[formula]

The above intersection points with the germs (a,A), ra > r should be symmetric to points of intersection [formula] with x-coordinates asymptotically equivalent to [formula]. The latter points of intersection lie in the union of the germs ai, by Proposition [\ref=asynt] and due to [formula]. Therefore, exactly k2 powers θqaiij are equal to [formula]. The collection M of the powers [formula] is symmetric with respect to 1, by relative symmetry property and the above arguments. The proposition is proved.

Set

[formula]

Let [formula]. Then

[formula]

The invariance of the collection M under the symmetry with respect to 1 implies that the sum of its elements equals the cardinality card(M) = Π - k1 - k2. On the other hand,

[formula]

by definition. Let us calculate the latter right-hand side. One has

[formula]

as in ([\ref=sumtq]). Substituting ([\ref=pt]) to ([\ref=k12]) yields

[formula]

which is equivalent to ([\ref=rpk1]).

Suppose the contrary: the germ b is not quadratic, i.e., [formula]. Let us write [formula] with p and q being coprime. Then

[formula]

Case 1): Suppose that r > 2. Hence, [formula]. One has

[formula]

by ([\ref=rpk1]). This implies that there exists a polynomial Wi for which more than [formula]-th part of its roots have qai-th powers equal to [formula]. Thus, the number of the latter roots is no less than [formula]. We will show that the above Wi cannot exist. Let it exist, and let us fix it. None of its roots θij with [formula] can be a multiple root. Indeed, the derivative of the polynomial Wi(θ) equals

[formula]

since r(pai - qai) = rqai(r - 1) = pai(r - 1). Therefore, the qai-th powers of the roots of the derivative are equal to [formula]. Hence, the si + 1 roots θ  =  θij of the polynomial Wi with [formula] are distinct and satisfy the equality

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore, equation ([\ref=theta0]) has at least si + 1 distinct solutions obtained from each other by multiplication with qai-th roots of unity. Their pai-th powers are equal, by ([\ref=theta0]). Therefore, the ratio of any two distinct solutions is simultaneously a qai-th and pai-th root of unity, and hence, an si-th root of unity, since pai = sip, qai = siq and p, q are coprime. This implies that equation ([\ref=theta0]) may have at most si distinct solutions with equal qai-th powers. The contradiction thus obtained proves Theorem [\ref=tsym].

Case 2): Suppose that 1 < r < 2. One has

[formula]

by ([\ref=rpk1]). This implies that the there exists a polynomial Wi that has at least si + 1 roots whose qai-th powers are equal to 2, as in the previous case. We then get a contradiction, as in the above discussion. Theorem [\ref=tsym] is proved.

Invariants of singularities, Plücker formulas, and the proof of Theorem [\ref=shust]

The proof essentially uses general Plücker and genus formulas for plane algebraic curves. The main observation is that the upper bound 2 to the projective Puiseux exponents of all local branches of the curve and Plücker formulas yield that the singularity invariants of the considered curve must obey a relatively high lower bound. On the other hand, the contribution of the points in the infinite line [formula] appears to be not sufficient to fit that lower bound unless the curve is a conic.

Invariants of plane curve singularities

For the reader's convenience, we recall here main definitions and formulas. Almost all this stuff is classically known (see [\cite=BK], [\cite=Mi], and the modern exposition in [\cite=GLS]).

Let (x0:x1:x2) be homogeneous coordinates on [formula]. Let [formula] be a reduced, irreducible curve of degree d > 1, i.e., given by a homogeneous square-free, irreducible polynomial F(x0,x1,x2) of degree d > 1. For any point A∈γ, denote by (γ,A) the germ of γ at A, or, more precisely, an intersection [formula], where [formula] is a sufficiently small closed ball centered at A. Topologically, (γ,A) is a bouquet of discs bi, 1  ≤  i  ≤  r, called local branches of γ at A. In an affine plane in [formula] containing A and having affine coordinates (x,y) such that A = (0,0) and the x-axis is tangent to the branch bi, the branch bi admits a Puiseux parametrization ([\ref=curve]).

(1) Multiplicity and dual multiplicity of a local branch. Given a local branch bi of the curve γ at A∈γ and its Puiseux parametrization ([\ref=curve]), the number s(bi) = q is called the multiplicity, and the number s*(bi) = p - q the dual multiplicity of the branch bi. Note that s(bi) is the intersection multiplicity of the branch bi with a transversal line, while s*(bi) + s(bi) is the intersection multiplicity with the tangent line TAbi. Observe also that the subquadraticity condition for bi is equivalent to the relation

[formula]

(2) δ-invariant. Let f(x,y) = 0 be an equation of the germ (γ,A) (just F = 0 rewritten in the coordinates x,y). Then [formula], for [formula], is a smooth surface with r holes (Milnor fiber). The δ-invariant of the germ (γ,A) admits several equivalent definitions and topologically can be defined as the genus of the closed surface obtained by attaching a sphere with r holes to the surface [formula]. The genus formula, originally discovered by Hironaka [\cite=Hir], reads

[formula]

where g(γ) is the geometric genus of γ, i.e., the genus of the Riemann surface obtained by the resolution of singularities of γ. In particular, we have

[formula]

(3) Class of the singular point (κ-invariant). Given a germ (γ,A) and local affine coordinates (x,y) as above, suppose that the y-axis is not tangent to any of the local branches bi, 1  ≤  i  ≤  r. Denote by γ' the polar curve of γ defined by the equation [formula]. The class of the germ (γ,A) is defined by

[formula]

the intersection multiplicity of γ and γ' at A. It is well-known that

[formula]

(4) Hessian of the singular (or inflection) point. The Hessian Hγ of the curve γ is the curve given by the equation [formula]. The Hessian of the germ (γ,A) is

[formula]

the intersection multiplicity of γ and Hγ at A. It vanishes in all smooth points of γ, where γ quadratically intersects its tangent line. An expression for h(γ,A) via the preceding invariants was found in [\cite=shus]. It can be written as

[formula]

In view of deg Hγ = 3(d - 2), Bézout's theorem yields (a Plücker formula)

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=shust]

Let [formula] be a curve of degree [formula], satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=shust]. We will show that d = 2.

Observe that δ(γ,A) = κ(γ,A) = h(γ,A) = 0 for all points [formula]. Denote by Btr, resp. Btan the set of the local branches of γ centered on [formula] and transversal, resp. tangent to [formula]. Relation ([\ref=ed1]) holds for all the local branches b∈Btr. Thus, from ([\ref=ed6]) and ([\ref=ed7]), we get

[formula]

Together with ([\ref=ed2]) and ([\ref=ed3]) this yields

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Developing [formula] into contributions of local branches [formula], we obtain

[formula]

and hence the sequence of relations ([\ref=ed8]) reduces to

[formula]

If [formula] and all the branches b∈Btr are centered at one point, then [formula], and the intersection multiplicity of γ with the tangent to one of the branches b∈Btr appears to be greater than d. This implies that the latter tangent line is contained in γ. Thus, γ splits off a line, contrary to the irreducibility assumption.

If [formula], |Btr| = 2, and the two branches b1,b2∈Btr have distinct centers, we have an equality in ([\ref=ed9]); hence, equalities in all the above relations, in particular, in ([\ref=ed11]). Thus, in view of ([\ref=ed6]), ([\ref=ed7]) and the inequality s*(bi)  ≤  s(bi) (subquadraticity), it means s*(bi) = s(bi), i = 1,2. Intersecting C with the tangent lines to b1 and b2, we obtain [formula], i = 1,2, while the intersection with [formula] yields s(b1) + s(b2) = d. It follows that [formula]. Choosing affine coordinates in [formula] so that the coordinate axes are tangent to b1 and b2 (at infinity) respectively, we obtain that the Newton polygon of the defining polynomial of γ is just the segment

[formula]

z=t,  w=ct(1+o(1)),  t∈( C,0)

[formula]

, i.e., the coefficients of all the monomials zi1wj1 with (i,j) below this segment vanish. In the coordinates [formula], [formula], this yields that the coefficients of all monomials xiyj with j < i vanish. The same consideration with the affine coordinates z2,w2 in a neighborhood of the center B of the branch b2 such that TBb2 is the z2 -axis and [formula] is the w2-axis leads to the conclusion that the coefficients of all monomials xiyj with j > i vanish. This finally leaves the only Newton segment
