Nonminimal Lorentz-Violating Effects in Photon Physics

The Standard-Model Extension (SME) can be understood as an effective field theory derived from a more fundamental theory that lives in some high energy scale, presumably the Planck energy EP. Therefore, it is a natural expectation that the SME should contain minimal (renormalizable) Lorentz-violating (LV) operators, as well as an infinite number of nonminimal, higher derivative, nonminimal operators. On dimensional grounds, the latter are expected to be suppressed by inverse powers of the high energy scale EP, so they should not be the most relevant at low energy. Indeed, until recently, most investigations were restricted to the set of minimal LV operators due to these general expectations, apart from the obvious fact that this restriction reduces the infinite set of nonminimal LV operators to a still large but finite set of operators. This approach proved itself very fruitful, yielding an impressive set of constraints on LV from a wide variety of experiments and observations.[\cite=Kostelecky:2008ts]

A natural question is therefore whether nonminimal LV operators[\cite=km09] [\cite=km13] could induce observable effects in low energy physics. Finding specific instances of low energy phenomenology where a nonminimal LV operator could give a contribution not obscured by another minimal LV operator would be particularly interesting. In Ref. , we studied a particular model that realizes this scenario, where the presence of a very massive fermion field, with specific LV interactions, induces at low energy a correction to the very same coupling between light pseudoscalars and photons that is subject to several experimental investigations. The QCD axion[\cite=Peccei:1977hh] is a specific example of this class of light pseudoscalars, but our discussion is valid for general axion-like particles (ALPs).[\cite=Ringwald:2012cu]

An ALP is represented in QFT by a pseudoscalar field φ and couples to the photon via the interaction

[formula]

which allows for searches for ALPs in low energy photons experiments. To obtain an LV correction to Eq. ([\ref=eq:1]), we postulated the existence of a very massive fermion field ψ that couples both to the photon and to the ALP,

[formula]

where LA, Lφ, and Lψ denote the standard free lagrangians for the photon, the ALP, and the fermion field, respectively. We notice in Eq. ([\ref=eq:2]) the presence of a minimal LV coupling bμ, as well as a non minimal one, dμ. Integration of the fermion field yields a low energy effective lagrangian which contains the term

[formula]

The coefficient C is finite, but regularization dependent. The Feynman integrals contributing to Eq. ([\ref=eq:3]) are actually the same studied some years ago regarding the perturbative generation of the CFJ lagrangian.[\cite=CFJ] [\cite=JackivKostel] [\cite=Brito:2007uc] From the experimental viewpoint, this result means that the ALP-photon interaction measured by experimentalist could contain a hidden LV contribution, arising from the specific setting of high energy LV studied by us.

Motivated by these results, we also calculated the complete correction induced in the low energy photon sector of our model, due to the presence of the massive fermion. Disregarding the presence of the pseudocscalar φ in Eq. ([\ref=eq:2]) and after integration over the fermion field, we obtained[\cite=Highoperators]

[formula]

where M is the mass of the fermion, and

[formula]

This effective action incorporates all the effects arising in low energy photon physics due to the presence of the massive fermion ψ and the LV coupling dμ. It contains both nonlinear effects, starting with the so-called Euler-Eisenberg term,

[formula]

where R = q4  /  45πM4 and S = 7R, as well as LV corrections, whose leading term is

[formula]

A natural question is whether wave propagation in vacuum is modified in this model. Considering only modifications up to first order in the nonlinearities and LV, we obtain the following set of modified Maxwell's equations in vacuum,

[formula]

and

[formula]

together with the unmodified equations [formula] and [formula], where

[formula]

and [formula]. It is evident that the right-hand side of Eqs. ([\ref=eq:ME1]) and ([\ref=eq:ME2]) vanish for the standard Maxwell theory. In our case, these terms are not zero; however they are of second order in R, S and dμ, so in this approximation we have the surprising result that the LV completely decouples from wave propagation.

Nontrivial LV effects can, however, be found in the interaction between electromagnetic sources. We singled out from Eq. ([\ref=eq:seffpronta]) one specific LV operator, which allows us to calculate exactly the classical electromagnetic interaction between sources. The specific lagrangian we considered was

[formula]

By fixing the Coulomb gauge and finding the exact photon propagator Dμν(x,y), we can calculate the interaction energy between different sources,

[formula]

where T is the time variable, and the limit T  →    ∞   is implicit. In Ref.  we considered several situations involving pointlike charges, steady line currents and Dirac strings, obtaining new effects arising from the LV. As an example, a dipole would experience a spontaneous torque depending on the angle between the dipole and the space component of the background vector dμ. These are effects that could possibly lead to experimental signals involving the nonminimal LV coupling dμ.
