Random space and plane curves

Introduction

In this paper we study random curves in space and in the plane. Our study was initially inspired by the subject of random knots. The subject of random knots seems to be quite extensive, and many models of such knots have been suggested. The model in use in this paper, while not new (the author became aware of it in the early 1980s, when a version was suggested by Bill Thurston - indeed, in this paper we answer questions he posed back in the early 1980s), seems to be the least studied of all.

The model follows naturally from the following sequence of questions (and answers):

What is a knot? A knot is a continuous map from [formula] to [formula]

What is a continuous map from [formula] to [formula] A map from [formula] to [formula] is a triple of continuous maps from [formula] to [formula]

How do you represent a map from [formula] to [formula] By a Fourier series:

[formula]

What is a random such function? The obvious way to produce a random periodic function is to let ak,bk be random variables. The most obvious method: letting ak,bk be independent identically distributed centered Gaussians does not work for our purposes (the functions thus obtained will be very wild). However, it is well-known that if ak,bk decay at least as fast as k3 / 2 + ε, then the resulting function will be of class C1.[\cite=kahane1993some]

Our main result is the following:

Suppose [formula] are independent centered Gaussians with standard deviation of ak,bk equal to k- 3 / 2 - ε, for ε > 0, and let

[formula]

while

[formula]

Then, the expected number of self-intersections of the plane curve [formula] is finite, and grows at most linearly in 1 / ε.

Theorem [\ref=mainthm] has a number of easy corollaries.

If γ(θ)  =  x(θ),y(θ), as in the statement of Theorem [\ref=mainthm] is a random smooth plane curve, then the probability that the number of self-intersections of γ exceeds N decays at least linearly in N.

This is an immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=mainthm] combined with Markov's Inequality.

Let γ(θ)  =  (x(θ),y(θ),z(θ)) be a random knot, where x(θ),y(θ) are as in the statement of Theorem [\ref=mainthm], while

[formula]

where ek,fk are independent (also independent of all of the a,b,c,d centered Gaussians with standard deviation of ek,fk equal to k- 3 / 2 - ε (same as ak,bk,ck,dk) Then the probability that the crossing number of γ is greater than N decays at least linearly in N.

We take the first two coordinates of γ and apply Corollary [\ref=markov].

Slowly decaying coefficients

A philosophically different model consists of taking random trigonometric polynomials, as opposed to series (or, if the reader prefers, truncating the series after N terms. The methods used to prove Theorem [\ref=mainthm] immediately say that the expected number of crossings of a knot given by such a polynomial is quadratic in N, as long as the standard deviations of the coefficients decay slower than k3 / 2.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm]

Our first ingredient is [\cite=edelman1995many]:

Let [formula] be a differential function from [formula] to [formula] let U be a measurable subset of [formula] and let A be a random m  ×  (n + 1) matrix. Assume that the rows of A are iid multivariate normal vectors, with mean zero and covariance matrix C. The expected number of real roots of the system of equations Av(t)  =  0 equals

[formula]

Now, in Theorem [\ref=mainthm] we are looking for the self-intersections of the curve γ(θ)  =  (x(θ),y(θ)). This means that we are looking for pairs s,t such that x(t)  =  x(s),y(t) = y(s), so we are looking for zeros of the vector function (x(t) - x(s),y(t) - y(s). However, we want to eliminate the trivial zeros (where t = s), which can be achieved by looking for zeros of (x(t) - x(s),y(t) - y(s)) / g(t - s), where g is a function vanishing to first order at zero, and nowhere else in (0,2π) (we will see that it is somewhat useful to have the flexibility of choosing g.

Now, we will apply Theorem [\ref=edelmank] with while

[formula]

If ak,bk,ck,dk are independent normal with standard deviation σk  =  k-  α, the covariance matrix C is the diagonal matrix, with diagonal entries k- 2α. Finally, simple trigonometry tells us that

[formula]

In the case where α is an integer, the above expression can be evaluated in closed form.

Suppose α  =  2. Then, it can be shown that:

[formula]

Using this, and g(x)  =  x, one can write down the correlation in the case where α  =  2 as

[formula]

Using this, one can compute the expectation in closed form as:

[formula]

In the general case, we set g(x)  =   sin (x / 2). This gives us:

[formula]

where f1 and f2 denote the two log terms in the formula. We have

[formula]

The other derivatives are a little more tedious to calculate:

[formula]

It is clear that the dominant terms in all the second partials (as α approaches 3 / 2) are of the form

[formula]

and these converge precisely when α  >  3 / 2.

The truth, and experiments

It is almost certain that Corollary [\ref=decaycor] is nowhere near sharp, and the probability described therein decays exponentially in N. For space curves, we have conducted experiments with different decay rates, and estimated the knot types by computing the Alexander polynomial. When coefficients decay at the threshold decay rate of k3 / 2, the results are that in 100 experiments, we get 97 unknots and 3 trefoils. At the decay rate of k2, there are only unknots. At linear decay rate, around half the knots (51 out a hundred) are knots, 23 are trefoils, 4 are 52 knots ("three twist knot"), 2 820 knots and a smattering of others. For α = 5 / 4, there are 89 unknots, 8 trefoils, and one each of figure 8, the 52 knot, and one septafoil (71) knot.

Distribution of zeros of random Alexander polynomials

We generated 600 random knots of degree 100 with centered normal coefficients decaying linearly, and we plotted their set of zeros (so, no multiplicity information is present). The highest degree of Alexander polynomial was equal to 12. The data is summarized in Figure [\ref=alexfig]. You will notice that the distribution of the roots is quite asymmetric around the imaginary axis, quite unlike the distribution of zeros of random reciprocal polynomials (of degree 12, with coefficients uniform in

[formula]

Coefficients of Alexander polynomials

We see by looking at Figure [\ref=alexfig3] (for example) that there are no zeros of Alexander polynomials of random knots around the point z = 1, from which, if the coefficients were positive, we would know (by the work of [\cite=lebowitz2016central]) that the coefficients would be normally distributed. Our Alexander polynomials are not blessed with positive coefficients, but below are the graphs (Figures [\ref=alexroots60], [\ref=alexroots70], [\ref=alexroots80], [\ref=alexroots90]) of the logarithm of the absolute value of the coefficients as a function of the degree of the monomial. Each graph is for single random knot - no averaging has been perfomed. It should also be noted that any reciprocal polynomial which evaluates to 1 at 1 is the Alexander polynomial of some knot (see [\cite=kawauchi2012survey]), so there is definitely a concentration of measure phenomenon going on. The graphs appear to somewhat-smaller-than-semi ellipses.
