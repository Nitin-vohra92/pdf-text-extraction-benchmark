Kazdan-Warner equation on graph

Introduction

A basic problem in Riemannian geometry is that of describing curvatures on a given manifold. Suppose that (Σ,g) is a 2-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold without boundary, and K is the Gaussian curvature on it. Let [formula] be a metric conformal to g, where u∈C∞(Σ). To find a smooth function [formula] as the Gaussian curvature of [formula], one is led to solving the nonlinear elliptic equation

[formula]

where Δg denotes the Laplacian operator on (Σ,g). Let v be a solution to [formula], where

[formula]

Set ψ = 2(u - v). Then ψ satisfies

[formula]

If one frees this equation from the geometric situation, then it is a special case of

[formula]

where c is a constant, and h is some prescribed function, with neither c nor h depends on geometry of (Σ,g). Clearly one can consider ([\ref=equation]) in any dimensional manifold. Now let (Σ,g) be a compact Riemannian manifold of any dimension. Note that the solvability of ([\ref=equation]) depends on the sign of c. Let us summarize results of Kazdan-Warner [\cite=Kazdan-Warner]. For this purpose, think of (Σ,g) and h∈C∞(Σ) as being fixed with  dim  Σ  ≥  1.

Case 1. c < 0. A necessary condition for a solution is that [formula], in which case there is a critical strictly negative constant c-(h) such that ([\ref=equation]) is solvable if c-(h) < c < 0, but not solvable if c < c-(h).

Case 2. c = 0. When  dim  Σ  ≤  2, the equation ([\ref=equation]) has a solution if and only if both [formula] and h is positive somewhere. When  dim  Σ  ≥  3, the necessary condition still holds.

Case 3. c > 0. When  dim  Σ = 1, so that Σ = S1, then ([\ref=equation]) has a solution if and only if h is positive somewhere. When  dim  Σ = 2, there is a constant 0 < c+(h)  ≤    +    ∞   such that ([\ref=equation]) has a solution if h is positive somewhere and if 0 < c < c+(h).

There are tremendous work concerning the Kazdan-Warner problem, among those we refer the reader to Chen-Li [\cite=Chen-Li1] [\cite=Chen-Li2], Ding-Jost-Li-Wang [\cite=DJLW1] [\cite=DJLW2], and the references therein.

In this paper, we consider the Kazdan-Warner equation on a finite graph. In our setting, we shall prove the following: In Case 1, we have the same conclusion as the manifold case; In Case 2, the equation ([\ref=equation]) has a solution if and only if both [formula] and h is positive somewhere; While in Case 3, the equation ([\ref=equation]) has a solution if and only if h is positive somewhere. Following the lines of Kazdan-Warner [\cite=Kazdan-Warner], for results of Case 2 and Case 3, we use the variational method; for results of Case 1, we use the principle of upper-lower solutions. It is remarkable that Sobolev spaces on a finite graph are all pre-compact. This leads to a very strong conclusion in Case 3 compared with the manifold case.

We organized this paper as follows: In Section [\ref=sec1], we introduce some notations on graphs and state our main results. In Section [\ref=sec2], we give two important lemmas, namely, the Sobolev embedding and the Trudinger-Moser embedding. In Sections [\ref=sec3]-[\ref=sec5], we prove Theorems [\ref=Theorem_1]-[\ref=Theorem_4] respectively. In Section [\ref=sec6], we discuss related equations involving higher order derivatives.

Settings and main results

Let G = (V,E) be a finite graph, where V denotes the vertex set and E denotes the edge set. For any edge xy∈E, we assume that its weight wxy > 0 and that wxy = wyx. Let [formula] be a finite measure. For any function [formula], the μ-Laplacian (or Laplacian for short) of u is defined by

[formula]

where y  ~  x means xy∈E. The associated gradient form reads

[formula]

Write Γ(u) = Γ(u,u). We denote the length of its gradient by

[formula]

For any function [formula], an integral of g over V is defined by

[formula]

and an integral average of g is denoted by

[formula]

where [formula] stands for the volume of V.

The Kazdan-Warner equation on graph reads

[formula]

where Δ is defined as in ([\ref=lap]), [formula], and [formula] is a function. If c = 0, then ([\ref=KZ-equ]) is reduced to

[formula]

Our first result can be stated as following:

Let G = (V,E) be a finite graph, and [formula] be a function on V. Then the equation ([\ref=0equ]) has a solution if and only if h changes sign and [formula].

In cases c > 0 and c < 0, we have the following:

Let G = (V,E) be a finite graph, c be a positive constant, and [formula] be a function. Then the equation ([\ref=KZ-equ]) has a solution if and only if h is positive somewhere.

Let G = (V,E) be a finite graph, c be a negative constant, and [formula] be a function. (i) If ([\ref=KZ-equ]) has a solution, then [formula]. (ii) If [formula], then there exists a constant -    ∞    ≤  c-(h) < 0 depending on h such that ([\ref=KZ-equ]) has a solution for any c-(h) < c < 0, but has no solution for any c < c-(h).

Concerning the constant c-(h) in Theorem [\ref=Theorem_3], we have the following:

Let G = (V,E) be a finite graph, c be a negative constant, and [formula] be a function. Suppose that c-(h) is given as in Theorem [\ref=Theorem_3]. If h(x)  ≤  0 for all x∈V, but [formula], then c-(h) =  -   ∞  .

Preliminaries

Define a Sobolev space and a norm on it by

[formula]

and

[formula]

respectively. If V is a finite graph, then W1,2(V) is exactly the set of all functions on V, a finite dimensional linear space. This implies the following Sobolev embedding:

Let G = (V,E) be a finite graph. The Sobolev space W1,2(V) is pre-compact. Namely, if {uj} is bounded in W1,2(V), then there exists some u∈W1,2(V) such that up to a subsequence, uj  →  u in W1,2(V).

Also we have the following Trudinger-Moser embedding:

Let G = (V,E) be a finite graph. For any β > 1, there exists a constant C depending only on β and V such that for all functions v with [formula] and [formula], there holds

[formula]

Proof. Let β > 1 be fixed. For any function v satisfying [formula] and [formula], we have by the Poincare inequality

[formula]

where C0 is some constant depending only on V. Denote μmin  =   min x∈Vμ(x). In view of ([\ref=int]), the above inequality leads to [formula]. Hence

[formula]

This gives the desired result. [formula]

The case c = 0

In the case c = 0, our approach comes out from that of Kazdan-Warner [\cite=Kazdan-Warner].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_1].

Necessary condition. If ([\ref=0equ]) has a solution u, then e- uΔu =  - h. Integration by parts gives

[formula]

since (e- u(y) - e- u(x))(u(y) - u(x))  ≤  0 for all x,y∈V and u is not a constant.

Sufficient condition. We use the calculus of variations. Suppose that h changes sign and

[formula]

Define a set

[formula]

We claim that

[formula]

To see this, since h changes sign and ([\ref=mean-h]), we can assume h(x1) > 0 for some x1∈V. Take a function v1 satisfying [formula] and v1(x) = 0 for all [formula]. Hence

[formula]

for sufficiently large [formula]. Writing [formula], we have by the above inequality that φ(1) > 0. Obviously [formula]. Thus there exists a constant 0 < t0 < 1 such that φ(t0) = 0. Let [formula], where [formula] stands for the volume of V. Then [formula]. This concludes our claim ([\ref=B-non]).

We shall minimize the functional [formula]. Let

[formula]

Take a sequence of functions {vn}  ⊂  B1 such that J(vn)  →  a. Clearly [formula] is bounded and [formula]. Hence vn is bounded in W1,2(V). Since V is a finite graph, the Sobolev embedding (Lemma [\ref=Sobolv]) implies that up to a subsequence, vn  →  v∞ in W1,2(V). Hence [formula], [formula], and thus v∞∈B1. Moreover

[formula]

One can calculate the Euler-Lagrange equation of v∞ as follows:

[formula]

where λ and γ are two constants. Indeed, for any φ∈W1,2(V), there holds

[formula]

which gives ([\ref=E-L1]) immediately. Integrating the equation ([\ref=E-L1]), we have γ = 0. We claim that [formula]. For otherwise, we conclude from Δv∞ = 0 and [formula] that [formula]. This is a contradiction. We further claim that λ > 0. This is true because [formula] and

[formula]

Thus we can write [formula] for some constant ϑ. Then u = v∞  +  ϑ is a desired solution of ([\ref=0equ]). [formula]

The case c > 0

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_2].

Necessary condition. Suppose c > 0 and u is a solution to ([\ref=KZ-equ]). Since [formula], we have

[formula]

Hence h must be positive somewhere on V.

Sufficient condition. Suppose h(x0) > 0 for some x0∈V. Define a set

[formula]

We claim that [formula]. To see this, we set

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

We also set [formula], which leads to

[formula]

Hence there exists a sufficiently large [formula] such that [formula] and [formula]. We define a function [formula] by

[formula]

Then φ(0) < cVol(V) < φ(1), and thus there exists a t0∈(0,1) such that φ(t0) = cVol(V). Hence [formula] and our claim follows. We shall solve ([\ref=KZ-equ]) by minimizing the functional

[formula]

on B2. For this purpose, we write [formula], so [formula]. Then for any u∈B2, we have

[formula]

and thus

[formula]

Let [formula]. Then [formula] and [formula]. By the Poincare inequality, [formula] for some constant C0 depending only on V. By Lemma [\ref=T-M-lemma], for any β > 1, one can find a constant C depending only on β and V such that

[formula]

This together with an elementary inequality [formula] implies that for any ε > 0,

[formula]

where C is a positive constant depending only on ε and V. Hence

[formula]

In view of ([\ref=ju]), the above inequality leads to

[formula]

where C1 is some constant depending only on ε and V. Choosing [formula], and noting that [formula], we obtain for all u∈B2,

[formula]

Therefore J has a lower bound on the set B2. This permits us to consider

[formula]

Take a sequence of functions {uk}  ⊂  B2 such that J(uk)  →  b. Let [formula]. Then [formula], and it follows from ([\ref=lowerb]) that vk is bounded in W1,2(V). This together with the equality

[formula]

implies that [formula] is a bounded sequence. Hence {uk} is also bounded in W1,2(V). By the Sobolev embedding (Lemma [\ref=Sobolv]), up to a subsequence, uk  →  u in W1,2(V). It is easy to see that u∈B2 and J(u) = b. Using the same method of ([\ref=euler]), we derive the Euler-Lagrange equation of the minimizer u, namely, Δu = c - λheu for some constant λ. Noting that [formula], we have λ = 1. Hence u is a solution of the equation ([\ref=KZ-equ]). [formula]

The case c < 0

In this section, we prove Theorem [\ref=Theorem_3] by using a method of upper and lower solutions. In particular, we show that it suffices to construct an upper solution of the equation ([\ref=KZ-equ]). This is exactly the graph version of the argument of Kazdan-Warner ([\cite=Kazdan-Warner], Sections 9 and 10).

We call a function u- a lower solution of ([\ref=KZ-equ]) if for all x∈V, there holds

[formula]

Similarly, u+ is called an upper solution of ([\ref=KZ-equ]) if for all x∈V, it satisfies

[formula]

We begin with the following:

Let c < 0. If there exist lower and upper solutions, u- and u+, of the equation ([\ref=KZ-equ]) with u-  ≤  u+, then there exists a solution u of ([\ref=KZ-equ]) satisfying u-  ≤  u  ≤  u+.

Proof. We follow the lines of Kazdan-Warner ([\cite=Kazdan-Warner], Lemma 9.3). Set k1(x) =  max {1, - h(x)}, so that k1  ≥  1 and k1  ≥   - h. Let k(x) = k1(x)eu+(x). We define [formula] and [formula]. Since G = (V,E) is a finite graph and inf x∈Vk(x) > 0, we have that L is a compact operator and Ker(L) = {0}. Hence we can define inductively uj + 1 as the unique solution to

[formula]

where u0 = u+. We claim that

[formula]

To see this, we estimate

[formula]

Suppose u1(x0) - u0(x0) =  max x∈V(u1(x) - u0(x)) > 0. Then Δ(u1 - u0)(x0)  ≤  0, and thus L(u1 - u0)(x0) < 0. This is a contradiction. Hence u1  ≤  u0 on V. Suppose uj  ≤  uj - 1, we calculate

[formula]

where uj  ≤  ξ  ≤  uj - 1. Similarly as above, we have uj + 1  ≤  uj on V, and by induction, [formula] for any j. Noting that

[formula]

we also have by induction u-  ≤  uj on V for all j. Therefore ([\ref=monotone]) holds. Since V is finite, it is easy to see that up to a subsequence, uj  →  u uniformly on V. Passing to the limit j  →    +    ∞   in the equation ([\ref=equ1]), one concludes that u is a solution of ([\ref=KZ-equ]) with u-  ≤  u  ≤  u+. [formula]

Next we show that the equation ([\ref=KZ-equ]) has infinite lower solutions. This reduces the proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_3] to finding its upper solution.

There exists a lower solution u- of ([\ref=KZ-equ]) with c < 0. Thus ([\ref=KZ-equ]) has a solution if and only if there exists an upper solution.

Proof. Let [formula] for some constant A > 0. Since V is finite, we have

[formula]

uniformly with respect to x∈V. Noting that c < 0, we can find sufficiently large A such that u- is a lower solution of ([\ref=KZ-equ]). [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_3].

(i) Necessary condition. If u is a solution of ([\ref=KZ-equ]), then

[formula]

(ii) Sufficient condition. It follows from Lemmas [\ref=lemma9.3] and [\ref=lowersolution] that ([\ref=KZ-equ]) has a solution if and only if ([\ref=KZ-equ]) has an upper solution u+ satisfying

[formula]

Clearly, if u+ is an upper solution for a given c < 0, then u+ is also an upper solution for all [formula] with [formula]. Therefore, there exists a constant c-(h) with -    ∞    ≤  c-(h)  ≤  0 such that ([\ref=KZ-equ]) has a solution for any c > c-(h) but has no solution for any c < c-(h).

We claim that c-(h) < 0 under the assumption [formula]. To see this, we let v be a solution of [formula]. There exists some constant a > 0 such that

[formula]

Let eb = a. If [formula] and u+ = av + b, we have

[formula]

Thus if [formula], then the equation ([\ref=KZ-equ]) has an upper solution u+. Therefore, [formula] implies that [formula]. [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_4]. We shall show that if h(x)  ≤  0 for all x∈V, but [formula], then ([\ref=KZ-equ]) is solvable for all c < 0. For this purpose, we let v be a solution of [formula]. Note that [formula]. Pick constants a and b such that [formula] and eav + b - a > 0. Let u+ = av + b. Since h  ≤  0,

[formula]

Hence u+ is an upper solution. Consequently, c-(h) =  -   ∞   if h  ≤  0 but [formula]. [formula]

Some extensions

The equation ([\ref=equation]) involving higher order differential operators was also extensively studied on manifolds, see for examples [\cite=Djadli-Malchiodi] [\cite=LLL] and the references therein. In this section, we shall extend Theorems [\ref=Theorem_1]-[\ref=Theorem_4] to nonlinear elliptic equations involving higher order derivatives. For this purpose, we define the length of m-order gradient of u by

[formula]

where [formula] is defined as in ([\ref=grd]) for the function [formula], and [formula] denotes the usual absolute of the function [formula]. Define a Sobolev space by

[formula]

and a norm on it by

[formula]

Clearly Wm,2(V) is the set of all functions on V since V is finite. Moreover, we have the following Sobolev embedding and the Trudinger-Moser embedding:

Let G = (V,E) be a finite graph. Then for any integer m > 0, Wm,2(V) is pre-compact.

Let G = (V,E) be a finite graph. Let m be a positive integer. Then for any β > 1, there exists a constant C depending only on m, β and V such that for all functions v with [formula] and [formula], there holds

[formula]

We consider an analog of ([\ref=KZ-equ]), namely

[formula]

where m is a positive integer, c is a constant, and [formula] is a function. Obviously ([\ref=m-equ]) is reduced to ([\ref=KZ-equ]) when m = 1. Firstly we have the following:

Let G = (V,E) be a finite graph, [formula] be a function on V, and m be a positive integer. If c = 0, h changes sign, and [formula], then the equation ([\ref=m-equ]) has a solution.

Proof. We give the outline of the proof. Denote

[formula]

In view of ([\ref=B1]), we have that B3  =  B1, since V is finite. Hence [formula]. Now we minimize the functional [formula] on B3. The remaining part is completely analogous to that of the proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_1], except for replacing Lemma [\ref=Sobolv] by Lemma [\ref=m-Sob]. We omit the details but leave it to interested readers. [formula]

Secondly, in the case c > 0, the same conclusion as Theorem [\ref=Theorem_2] still holds for the equation ([\ref=m-equ]) with m > 1. Precisely we have the following:

Let G = (V,E) be a finite graph, c be a positive constant, [formula] be a function, and m be a positive integer. Then the equation ([\ref=m-equ]) has a solution if and only if h is positive somewhere.

Proof. Repeating the arguments of the proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_2] except for replacing Lemmas [\ref=Sobolv] and [\ref=T-M-lemma] by Lemmas [\ref=m-Sob] and [formula] respectively, we get the desired result. [formula]

Finally, concerning the case c < 0, we obtain a result weaker than Theorem [\ref=Theorem_3].

Let G = (V,E) be a finite graph, c be a negative constant, m is a positive integer, and [formula] be a function such that h(x) < 0 for all x∈V. Then the equation ([\ref=m-equ]) has a solution.

Proof. Since the maximum principle can not be available for equations involving poly-harmonic operators, we use the calculus of variations instead of the method of upper and lower solutions. Let c < 0 be fixed. Consider the functional

[formula]

Set

[formula]

Using the same method of proving ([\ref=B-non]) in the proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_2], we have [formula].

We now prove that J has a lower bound on B4. Let u∈B4. Write [formula]. Then [formula] and

[formula]

which leads to

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Since c < 0 and h(x) < 0 for all x∈V, we have max x∈Vh(x) < 0, and thus

[formula]

Inserting ([\ref=dl]) into ([\ref=lo-b]), we have

[formula]

By the Jensen inequality,

[formula]

Inserting ([\ref=jens]) into ([\ref=l-3]), we obtain

[formula]

Therefore J has a lower bound on B4. Set

[formula]

Take a sequence of functions {uk}  ⊂  B4 such that J(uk)  →  τ. We have by ([\ref=lll]) that

[formula]

for some constant C depending only on c, τ, V and h. By ([\ref=funct]), we estimate

[formula]

The Poincare inequality implies that there exists some constant C depending only on m and V such that

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=gra-b]), ([\ref=gr-2]), and ([\ref=poinc]), one can see that {uk} is bounded in Wm,2(V). Then it follows from Lemma [\ref=m-Sob] that there exists some function u such that up to a subsequence, uk  →  u in Wm,2(V). Clearly u∈B4 and J(u) =  lim k  →    ∞J(uk) = τ. In other words, u is a minimizer of J on the set B4. It is not difficult to check that ([\ref=m-equ]) is the Euler-Lagrange equation of u. This completes the proof of the theorem. [formula]
