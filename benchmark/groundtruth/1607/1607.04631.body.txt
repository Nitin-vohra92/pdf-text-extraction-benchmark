Area bounds for minimal surfaces that pass through a prescribed point in a ball

Introduction

In this note, we study the area of a minimal submanifold in the unit ball in [formula]. For a minimal submanifold Σ that passes through the center of the ball, it is well-known that the area of Σ is bounded from below by the area of a flat k-dimensional disk:

Let Σ be a k-dimensional minimal submanifold in the unit ball Bn which passes through the origin and satisfies ∂Σ  ⊂  ∂Bn. Then |Σ|  ≥  |Bk|.

Theorem [\ref=consequence.of.monotonicity] is a direct consequence of the well-known monotonicity formula for minimal submanifolds; see e.g. [\cite=Allard], [\cite=Simon].

In 1975, Alexander and Osserman [\cite=Alexander-Osserman] studied a closely related problem. More precisely, they considered a minimal surface in the unit ball in [formula] which passes through a prescribed point in the interior of the ball (not necessarily the center of the ball). In the special case of disk-type minimal surfaces, they were able to show that the area is smallest for a flat disk. However, their argument does not work for minimal surfaces of other topological types, nor does it generalize to higher dimensions. In this note, we completely settle this question:

Let Σ be a k-dimensional minimal submanifold in the unit ball Bn which passes through a point y∈Bn and satisfies ∂Σ  ⊂  ∂Bn. Then [formula]. Moreover, the inequality is strict unless Σ is a flat k-dimensional disk which is orthogonal to y.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=main.theorem] relies on an application of the first variation formula for minimal submanifolds (cf. [\cite=Allard], [\cite=Simon]) to a carefully chosen vector field in ambient space. In particular, our argument generalizes immediately to the varifold setting. A similar technique was used in [\cite=Brendle] to prove a sharp bound for the area of a free-boundary minimal surface in a ball. The main difficulty in this approach is to find the correct vector field. The vector field used in [\cite=Brendle] was obtained as the gradient of the Green's function for the Neumann problem on the unit ball. By contrast, the vector field used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=main.theorem] is not a gradient field, and does not have any obvious geometric interpretation.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main.theorem]

Let us fix a point y∈Bn. We define a vector field W on [formula] in the following way: For k > 2, we define

[formula]

For k = 2, we define

[formula]

Note that 1 - 2〈x,y〉 + |y|2  ≥  |x - y|2  >  0 for all points [formula]. This shows that W is indeed a smooth vector field on [formula].

For every point x∈Bn and every orthonormal k-frame [formula], we have

[formula]

Proof. A straightforward calculation gives

[formula]

Note that the preceding calculation is valid both for k  >  2 and for k = 2. This proves the assertion.

The vector field W vanishes along the boundary ∂Bn.

Proof. Suppose that x∈∂Bn. Then 1 - 2〈x,y〉 + |y|2  =  |x - y|2. This directly implies W(x) = 0.

We have

[formula]

as x  →  y.

Proof. This follows directly from the definition of W(x).

We now describe the proof of Theorem [\ref=main.theorem]. To that end, we assume that Σ is a minimal surface in Bn which passing through the point y. Since the vector field W vanishes along the boundary ∂Σ  ⊂  ∂Bn, we obtain

[formula]

by the divergence theorem. Here, ν denotes the inward pointing unit normal to the region [formula] within the surface Σ. In other words, the vector ν is tangential to Σ, but normal to [formula]. It is easy to see that

[formula]

for [formula]. Using Lemma [\ref=c], we obtain

[formula]

for [formula]. Since

[formula]

we conclude that

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=first.variation]) and ([\ref=term.1]) gives

[formula]

On the other hand, by Lemma [\ref=a] we have the pointwise inequality

[formula]

Putting these facts together, we obtain [formula], as claimed.

Finally, we study the case of equality. Suppose that [formula]. In this case, we have

[formula]

for each point [formula]. Hence, if x is an arbitrary point on [formula] and [formula] is an orthonormal basis of TxΣ, then we have

[formula]

This implies that Σ is a flat k-dimensional disk which is orthogonal to y. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=main.theorem].
