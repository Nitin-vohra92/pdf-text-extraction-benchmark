Algebraic embeddings of [formula] into [formula]

Introduction

There are many results concerning algebraic embeddings of some variety into the affine space [formula]. Let me recall two of them. Any two algebraic embeddings of a smooth variety X into [formula] are the same up to an algebraic automorphism of [formula], provided that n  >  2 dim X + 1. This result is due to Nori, Srinivas [\cite=Sr1991On-the-embedding-d] and Kaliman [\cite=Ka1991Extensions-of-isom]. If one relaxes the condition that the automorphism of [formula] must be algebraic, Kaliman [\cite=Ka2013Analytic-extension] and independently, Feller and the author [\cite=FeSt2014Holomorphically-Eq] proved the following improvement: Any two algebraic embeddings of a smooth variety X into [formula] are the same up to a holomorphic automorphism of [formula], provided that n  >  2 dim X.

As a further development of these results, we study algebraic embeddings of [formula] into [formula]. This article can be seen as a first example to understand algebraic embeddings into an arbitrary affine algebraic variety with a large automorphism group. Our main result is the following:

To the author's knowledge it is not known, whether all algebraic embeddings [formula] are the same up to an algebraic automorphism of [formula]. Also for algebraic embeddings [formula] it is an open problem, whether all these embeddings are the same up to an algebraic automorphism of [formula], see [\cite=Sh1992Polynomial-represe] for potential examples that are not equivalent to linear embeddings.

In fact, in a certain sense the class of algebraic embeddings [formula] is as big as the class of algebraic embedddings [formula]. More precisely, the following holds. If t  ↦  (g1(t),g2(t),g3(t)) is an algebraic embedding of [formula] into [formula], then one can apply a (tame) algebraic automorphism of [formula] such that afterwards the polynomial g2 divides g1g3  -  1 and thus the following map is an algebraic embedding

[formula]

In the first lemma, we list algebraic automorphisms of [formula] that we use constantly. The proof is straight forward.

Let n  ≥  2 and let i  ≠  j be integers in [formula]. Then, for every polynomial p in the variables xkl, k  ≠  i the map

[formula]

is an automorphism, where Eij(p) denotes the elementary matrix with ij-th entry equal to p. Similarly, for every polynomial q in the variables xkl, l  ≠  j the map

[formula]

is an automorphism.

Recall that the group of tame automorphisms of [formula] is the subgroup of the automorphisms of [formula] generated by the affine linear maps and the elementary automorphisms, i.e. the automorphisms of the form

[formula]

In the next result we list automorphisms of [formula] that are induced by automorphisms of [formula] via the projection to the first column [formula].

Let n  ≥  2. Every tame automorphism of [formula] that preserves the origin is induced by some automorphism of [formula] via [formula].

First, remark that the group of tame automorphisms of [formula] that preserve the origin is generated by the linear group [formula] and by the elementary automorphisms that preserve the origin. For every [formula], the automorphism

[formula]

induces via π1 the linear map v  ↦  A  ·  v of [formula], where [formula] denotes the n  ×  n-diagonal matrix with entries [formula]. Lemma [\ref=lem.autos1] implies that every elementary automorphism of [formula] that preserves the origin is induced by some automorphism of [formula] via π1. This finishes the proof.

A generic projection result

Let X be an algebraic variety. We say that a statement is true for generic x∈X if there exists a dense Zariski open subset U  ⊆  X such that the statement is true for all x∈U.

Let n  ≥  3. If [formula] is an algebraic embedding such that the matrices f(0) - f(1) and f'(0) have maximal rank, then, for generic [formula] the map

[formula]

is an algebraic embedding, where Mn(n - 1) denotes the space of n  ×  (n - 1)-matrices and πA is given by X  ↦  X  ·  A.

Let [formula] be the diagonal. Consider the following (Zariski) locally closed subsets of [formula]:

[formula]

Consider for every [formula] the composition

[formula]

This map is never zero for generic [formula]; indeed:

If 1  <  i  ≤  n, then [\eqref=eq.Composition] is never zero provided that [formula] has maximal rank.

If i  =  1, then dim C1  ≤  1, since dim Cn  =  2 (note that f(0) - f(1) has maximal rank). For (t,r)∈C1, let Z(t,r)  =   ker (f(t) - f(r)). Since dim C1  ≤  1  <  n - 1, a generic (n - 1)-dimensional subspace is different from Z(t,r) for all (t,r)∈C1. Thus for generic A the composition [formula] is never zero.

Clearly, [formula]. Hence, we proved that the composition [formula] is injective for generic [formula]. Clearly, [formula] is proper for generic [formula].

For the immersivity, we have to show for generic [formula] that

[formula]

for all [formula]. Since [formula], there exists a Zariski dense open subset [formula] such that [formula] if and only if t∈U. Thus [\eqref=eq2] is satisfied for all A  ≠  0 and for all t∈U. Since f is immersive, we have f'(t)  ≠  0 for all [formula]. This implies that for generic A we have f'(t)  ·  A  ≠  0 for all [formula].

For n  ≥  3, any two algebraic embeddings of [formula] into [formula] are the same up to an algebraic automorphism of [formula].

Let n  ≥  2. Assume that [formula] is an algebraic embedding such that

[formula]

is an algebraic embedding, where πn - 1 denotes the projection to the first n - 1 columns. Then there exists an algebraic automorphism φ of [formula] such that

[formula]

is given by [formula].

Let n  ≥  2 and let [formula] be an algebraic embedding such that [formula]. Then f is the same as

[formula]

up to an algebraic automorphism of [formula], where En1(t) denotes elementary matrix with left down corner equal to t.

Let ψ be the automorphism of [formula] defined by

[formula]

where xij denotes the ij-th entry of X. Now, one can easily check that [formula] is the embedding t  ↦  En1(t).

Assume that n  =  2. Since two algebraic embeddings of [formula] into [formula] are the same up to an algebraic automorphism of [formula] (Abhyankar-Moh-Suzuki Theorem, see [\cite=AbMo1975Embeddings-of-the-] [\cite=Su1974Proprietes-topolog]), one can see that there exists an algebraic automorphism of [formula] that preserves the origin and changes the embedding [formula] to the embedding [formula], t  ↦  (1,t). Using the fact that every algebraic automorphism of [formula] is tame (Jung' Theorem, see [\cite=Ju1942Uber-ganze-biratio]), it follows from Lemma [\ref=lem.autos2] that there exists an algebraic automorphism φ of [formula] such that [formula].

Assume that n  ≥  3. Let [formula]. Since the kernel of A(t) is one-dimensional for all t and since n  ≥  3, there exists a vector [formula] such that vT  ·  A(t) is non-zero for all [formula]. After applying an automorphism of [formula] of the form X  ↦  BXP, where [formula] and [formula] is a permutation matrix, we can assume that

the map [formula] given by t  ↦  (fij(t))1  ≤  i  ≤  n,2  ≤  j  ≤  n is an algebraic embedding and

the vector [formula] is non-zero for all [formula],

where fij(t) denotes the ij-th entry of the matrix f(t). By ii), there exist polynomials [formula], 2  ≤  k  ≤  n such that

[formula]

By i), there exist polynomials pk in the variables xij with 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, 2  ≤  j  ≤  n such that [formula]. Let [formula] be the automorphism

[formula]

Clearly, the left down corner of the matrix [formula] equals t. Now, one can easily construct an automorphism ψ of [formula] such that the first column of [formula] is equal to [formula]. This proves the lemma.

Start with an algebraic embedding [formula]. As [formula] is flexible, for any finite set Z in [formula] there exists an automorphism of [formula] which fixes Z and has prescribed jets in the points of Z, see [\cite=ArFlKa2013Flexible-varieties]. Using the fact that [formula] acts 2-transitively on [formula], see e.g. [\cite=ArFlKa2013Flexible-varieties], we can assume that

[formula]

Since n  ≥  3, by Lemma [\ref=lem.GenericProjection] we can assume that the composition

[formula]

is an algebraic embedding. After an algebraic coordinate change of [formula], we can assume that the first column of f(t) is equal to [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem:one]. Thus, up to an algebraic automorphism of [formula], f is the same as t  ↦  En1(t) by Lemma [\ref=lem:two]. This finishes the proof.

Any two algebraic embeddings [formula] are the same up to a holomorphic automorphism of [formula].

Since for all [formula] the embeddings

[formula]

are the same up to an algebraic automorphism of [formula], it is enough to prove Theorem [\ref=thm.SL2] up to a reparametrization of the embeddings [formula].

For the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm.SL2], we need the following rather technical result, which enables us to bring an arbitrary algebraic embedding [formula] in a "nice" position.

Let [formula] be an algebraic embedding. Then there exists a holomorphic automorphism φ of [formula] and a constant [formula] such that the embedding [formula] satisfies:

for all t∈g- 111(0) we have g12(t)  =  t;

the map t  ↦  (g11(t),g21(t)) is a proper, bimeromorphic immersion such that the image Γ has only simple normal crossing singularities;

the singularities of Γ are distinguished by the first coordinate of [formula];

the line [formula] intersects Γ transversally;

the map t  ↦  g11(t) is polynomial.

The proof of this proposition uses the following easy result which is a direct application of the Baire category theorem:

Let [formula] be the Fréchet space of holomorphic functions on [formula] with the compact-open topology. If S is the countable union of closed proper subspaces of [formula], then [formula] is dense in H.

Let [formula] and let [formula]. In our proof of Proposition [\ref=prop.help] we use the fact that the linear functionals on [formula]

[formula]

are continuous and thus their kernels are proper closed subspaces.

We denote

[formula]

After applying an algebraic automorphism of [formula] one can assume that f satisfies the following:

the maps t  ↦  x(t) and t  ↦  w(t) are non-constant polynomials;

the maps t  ↦  (x(t),z(t)) and t  ↦  (x(t),w(t)) are bimeromorphic and immersive;

the singularities of the image of t  ↦  (x(t),z(t)) lie inside [formula];

the image of t  ↦  (x(t),z(t)) intersects [formula] transversally.

As a consequence of b) and c) we get that the map t  ↦  (x(t),z(t),w(t)) is a proper holomorphic embedding.

Let [formula] be the roots of x(t)  =  0. After a reparametrization of f of the form t  ↦  t  +  a one can assume that w(ti)  ≠  w(tj) for all i  ≠  j and ti  ≠  0 for all i. Let [formula] such that e- ai  =    -  tiz(ti) and let [formula] be a polynomial map such that b(w(ti))  =  ai and b'(w(t))  =  0 for all t with x'(t)  =  0. After applying the holomorphic automorphism

[formula]

we can assume that the embedding f satisfies y(ti)  =  ti for all i and f still satisfies the properties a) to d).

Let ρ be the embedding t  ↦  (x(t),y(t),z(t)). Fix x0  ≠  0 such that

z(s)  ≠  0 and x'(s)  ≠  0 for all s∈x- 1(x0) and

the maps t  ↦  z(t) and t  ↦  w(t) are injective on x- 1(x0).

Let [formula]. With the aid of Lemma [\ref=lem.interpolation] one can see that there exists a holomorphic function [formula] that satisfies the following:

for all [formula] we have c(x,w)  ≠  c(x,w');

for all t with x'(t)  =  0, the partial derivative Dwc vanishes in (x(t),w(t));

for all [formula] we have c(0,w(ti))  =  0;

for all integers k,q and for all 2-element sets {i,j}  ≠  {l,p} we have

[formula]

for all integers k and for all i  ≠  j we have

[formula]

Let [formula] be the largest subset such that for all x0∈V the properties I) and II) are satisfied. By property a), the complement [formula] is a closed discrete (countable) subset of [formula]. The inequalities in iv) and v) are locally holomorphic in x0∈V after a local choice of sections [formula] of the covering x- 1(V)  →  V and a local choice of the branches of the logarithms. Since V is path-connected, one can now deduce that there exists a subset U  ⊆  V such that [formula] is countable and for all x0∈U the properties iv) and v) are satisfied.

According to i) and c) there exists [formula] such that for all [formula] we have the following: If [formula], then eλc(x1,w)z  ≠  eλc(x1,w')z'. Now, let φ be the following holomorphic automorphism

[formula]

and let [formula]. According to iii), g satisfies property (1) of the proposition. Property ii) implies that g is immersive. Clearly, g is proper and satisfies property (5) of the proposition. By iii), it follows that g satisfies property (4) of the proposition and thus g is bimeromorphic. By the choice of λ, it follows for x1∉U that g21(t)  ≠  g21(t') for all t  ≠  t'∈x- 1(x1). Since all x0∈U satisfy iv) and v) the image of t  ↦  (g11(t),g21(t)) has only simple normal crossings, which have distinct first coordinates in [formula]. This implies properties (2) and (3) of the proposition.

Let [formula] be an algebraic embedding. We will prove that up to a holomorphic automorphism of [formula] and up to a reparametrization, f is the same as the standard embedding t  ↦  E12(t).

After applying a holomorphic automorphism of [formula] and performing a reparametrization we can assume that f satisfies properties (1) to (5) of Proposition [\ref=prop.help]. We denote

[formula]

As usual, [formula] denotes the projection onto the first column. Let S be the (countable) closed discrete set of points [formula] such that [formula] with s1  ≠  s2, see property (2). For every s in S, it holds that y(s1)  ≠  y(s2), since f is an embedding and since all simple normal crossings of the image of [formula] lie inside [formula] due to property (4). Thus, we can choose [formula] such that

[formula]

Let [formula] be a holomorphic function with ψ1(0)  =  0 such that for all s∈S we have ψ1(x(s1))  =  as. This function exists, since x(s1)  =  x(s2)  ≠  0 for all s∈S (by property (4)), since [formula] is a closed analytic subset of [formula] (by property (5)) and since x(s1)  ≠  x(s'1) for distinct s, s' of S (by property (3)). Let α1 be the holomorphic automorphism of [formula] defined by

[formula]

By composing f with α1, we can assume that s1  -  y(s1)  =  s2  -  y(s2) for all s∈S. The embedding f still satisfies the properties (1) to (5).

Let [formula] be the image of [formula]. By Remmert's proper mapping theorem [\cite=Re1957Holomorphe-und-mer], Γ is a closed analytic subvariety of [formula]. Now, using that [formula] is immersive and Γ has only simple normal crossings, we get a holomorphic factorization

[formula]

Using properties (1) and (4), it follows that the map

[formula]

is holomorphic. Using Cartan's Theorem B [\cite=Ca1953Varietes-analytiqu], we can extend ẽ to a holomorphic map [formula]. Let α2 be the holomorphic automorphism of [formula] defined by

[formula]

After applying the automorphism α2 to f we can assume that y(t)  =  t. After applying a certain holomorphic automorphism, we can additionally assume that w(t)  =  x(t)  =  1, which implies z(t)  =  0. This finishes the proof.
