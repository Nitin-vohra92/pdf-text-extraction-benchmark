Full subgraphs

Introduction

A full subgraph of a graph G with edge-density p is an m-vertex subgraph H of minimum degree at least p(m  -  1). This notion was introduced by Erds, L uczak and Spencer [\cite=ELS]. We may think of a full subgraph as a particularly 'rich' subgraph, with 'unusually high' minimum degree: if we select m vertices of G uniformly at random, then the expected average degree of the subgraph they induce is exactly p(m - 1), which is the minimum degree we require for the subgraph to be full. One cannot in general expect to find m-vertex subgraphs of higher minimum degree, as may be seen for example by considering complete multipartite graphs with parts of equal sizes. Fixing p and n, one may ask for the largest m such that every n-vertex graph G has a full subgraph with m vertices. For a graph G, let f(G) denote the largest number of vertices in a full subgraph of G. If [formula] is a non-negative integer, define

[formula]

Erds, L uczak and Spencer [\cite=ELS] raised a problem which, in our terminology, amounts to determining fp(n) when [formula], and showed [formula]. In this paper, we prove the following theorem for general p, improving the lower bound of [\cite=ELS]:

For all p  =  pn such that [formula],

[formula]

Moreover for each c  >  1, if [formula] for some [formula], this bound is sharp and [formula].

We also show in Section [\ref=proofofgreedy] that if [formula] then [formula] and for all p  <  1, [formula]. A case of particular interest is [formula], where Theorem [\ref=main] together with the results of Erds, L uczak and Spencer [\cite=ELS] gives

[formula]

A similar construction to that of Erd os, Luczak and Spencer shows that fp(n) is within a logarithmic factor of [formula] when [formula]. The order of magnitude of fp(n) is not known in general, and we pose the following problem:

For each fixed p∈(0,1), determine the order of magnitude of fp(n).

Discrepancy and full subgraphs

Full subgraphs are related to subgraphs of large positive discrepancy. For a graph G of density p and a v-vertex subgraph set X  ⊂  V(G), let [formula], where e(X) denotes the number of edges of G that lie in X. The positive and negative discrepancy of G are respectively defined by

[formula]

The discrepancy of G is (G)  =   max {+(G),-(G)}. We prove the following result via a greedy algorithm in Section [\ref=proofofgreedy], relating positive discrepancy to full subgraphs:

Let G be a graph with +(G)  =  α > 0 and edge density p. Then

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=greedy] is best possible, since the graph G consisting of a clique with [formula] edges and n - m isolated vertices has f(G)  =  m and

[formula]

whereas the bound in Theorem [\ref=greedy] is [formula]. On the other hand, if G is any n-vertex graph obtained by adding or removing [formula] edges to a complete multipartite graph with a bounded number of parts of equal size, then [formula] and the lower bound in Theorem [\ref=greedy] is superseded by Theorem [\ref=main].

That there should be a relation between full subgraphs (which have unexpectedly high minimum degree) and subgraphs with large positive discrepancy (which have unexpectedly many edges) is not surprising. Indeed, it easy to show that any subgraph maximizing the positive discrepancy must be a full subgraph (a fact which gives an alternative proof of Theorem [\ref=greedy]); whether a deeper relation between the two notions exists is an interesting question.

Random and pseudorandom graphs

In a random or pseudo-random setting, we are able to improve our bounds on the size of a largest full subgraph by drawing on previous work on discrepancy. Extending earlier results of Erds and Spencer [\cite=ES] and Erds, Goldberg, Pach and Spencer [\cite=EGPS], Bollobás and Scott [\cite=BS] showed that if G is an n-vertex graph with density p satisfying [formula], then

[formula]

By the results of Erds and Spencer [\cite=ES], this is tight for [formula], and it is also tight for [formula] by extending the arguments in [\cite=ES] to show that asymptotically almost surely,

[formula]

and the same holds for -(Gn,p). While it is not difficult to show that (Gn,p) is concentrated, the asymptotic expected value of the discrepancy is not known.

For a graph G whose adjacency matrix has real eigenvalues [formula], define λ(G)  =   max {|λi|:2  ≤  i  ≤  n}. Alon [\cite=Alon86] proved |δ(X)|  ≤  λ(G)|X| for every set X  ⊆  V(G), and in particular (G)  ≤  λ(G)n. This result is sometimes called the Expander Mixing Lemma (see the survey of Krivelevich and Sudakov [\cite=KS]). We relate full subgraphs to positive discrepancy and eigenvalues as follows:

Let G be an n-vertex graph with +(G)  =  α and λ(G)  =  λ. Then

[formula]

This theorem is proved in Section [\ref=proofofeigandcofull].

Erds, L uczak and Spencer [\cite=ELS] showed that for [formula], f(Gn,p)  ≥  β1n  -  o(n) asymptotically almost surely, where β1  ≈  0.227. If G  =  Gn,p, then asymptotically almost surely [formula] (see Füredi and Kómlos [\cite=FK] and Vu [\cite=Vu]). Combining this with ([\ref=discrandom]) and Theorem [\ref=eig], we obtain asymptotically almost surely:

[formula]

In the other direction, results of Riordan and Selby [\cite=RS] imply f(Gn,p)  ≤  β2n  +  o(n) asymptotically almost surely, where [formula]. We believe that f(Gn,p) is concentrated around αn  +  o(n) for some function α  =  αp, and pose the following problem.

For each p∈(0,1), prove the existence and determine the value of a real number αp such that for all δ  >  0, [formula] as n  →    ∞  .

Full and co-full subgraphs

We also a consider a variant of our problem with a Ramsey-theoretic flavour. A subgraph H of a graph G is co-full if V(H) induces a full subgraph of Gc, the complement of G. Equivalently, if H has m vertices and G has density p, then H is co-full if V(H) induces a subgraph of G with maximum degree at most p(m  -  1). Let g(G) be the largest integer m such that G has a full subgraph with at least m vertices or a co-full subgraph with at least m vertices.

For any n-vertex graph G of density p with [formula], we have

[formula]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=cofull], given in Section [\ref=proofofeigandcofull], relies on applying Theorem [\ref=eig] together with results of Bollobás and Nikiforov [\cite=BollobasNikiforov04] (see also Bilu and Linial [\cite=BiluLinial]).

Bounding g(G) is related to, but distinct from, a problem of Erds and Pach [\cite=ErdosPach83] on quasi-Ramsey numbers. Erds and Pach [\cite=ErdosPach83] showed that for every n-vertex graph G, in either G or Gc there exists a subgraph with [formula] vertices and minimum degree at least [formula]. In particular, when G has density [formula], this shows [formula]. Erd os and Pach in addition gave an unusual weighted random graph construction G' to show their quasi-Ramsey bound was sharp up to a log  log n factor. However their construction is imbalanced (does not have density 1 / 2) and cannot be easily modified to yield a sublinear upper bound for g(G'). Setting g(n)  =   min {g(G):|V(G)|  =  n}, this leaves the following open problem:

Determine the order of magnitude of g(n).

By ([\ref=frandom]) with [formula], note that g(G) is linear in n for almost all n-vertex graphs G, and it seems plausible that [formula].

In light of quasi-Ramsey numbers, we may view the results in this paper as being concerned with a certain kind of 'quasi-Turán problem'. More generally, given θ∈[0,1] and a graph G on n vertices with edge density p, we could ask for the maximum number fp(n,θ) such that we can guarantee G contains a subgraph on m  ≥  fp(n,θ) vertices with minimum degree at least θ(m - 1). The case θ = 1 corresponds to Turán's theorem [\cite=Turan41], while the case θ = p is the focus of the present paper.

Half-full subgraphs

If G is a graph, then a half-full subgraph of G is a subgraph H of G such that [formula] for every v∈V(H). A key ingredient in the proof of Theorem [\ref=main] is the following theorem on half-full subgraphs:

Let G be an n-vertex graph. Then G contains a half-full subgraph with [formula] or [formula] vertices.

Theorem [\ref=relative] is best possible, in the sense that the smallest half-full subgraph of Kn has [formula] vertices and the smallest half-full subgraph of Kn,n has n  +  1 vertices when n is odd. For regular graphs, we obtain:

Let G be an n-vertex d-regular graph. Then G contains a full subgraph with [formula] or [formula] vertices.

(Note that of course G itself is full, as it is regular.) When d is very small relative to n, Alon [\cite=Alon97] showed that any d-regular n-vertex graph contains a subgraph on [formula] vertices in which the minimum degree is at least [formula], exceeding the requirement for a full subgraph and improving Corollary [\ref=regular] by an additive factor of [formula]. However, as observed by Alon [\cite=Alon97], such a result does not hold for large d, as for example complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs show.

q-Full subgraphs

For q∈[0,1], define a subgraph H to be q-full if dH(v)  ≥  qdG(v) for all v∈V(H). We prove:

Let G be a graph on n vertices. Then for every q∈[0,1], G contains one of the following:

a q-full subgraph on ⌈qn⌉ vertices, or

a (1 - q)-full subgraph on ⌊(1 - q)n⌋ vertices, or

a q-full subgraph on ⌈qn⌉ + 1 vertices and a (1 - q)-full subgraph on ⌊(1 - q)n⌋ + 1 vertices.

Using Theorem [\ref=q-full_or_(1-q)-full], we prove Theorem [\ref=relative] and an extension to [formula]-full subgraphs for r  ≥  3:

Let G be a graph on n vertices, and let [formula]. Then G contains a [formula]-full subgraph on [formula], [formula] or [formula] vertices.

Theorem [\ref=1/r-full] is best possible in the following sense: if r  ≥  3, consider the complete graph Kn for some n  ≥  r  +  2 with [formula]. A smallest [formula]-full subgraph of Kn has exactly [formula] vertices.

It is natural to ask whether Theorem [\ref=1/r-full] can be extended further to cover other q.

Determine whether there exists a constant c such that for every q∈[null], every n-vertex graph G has a q-full subgraph with at least ⌊qn⌋ vertices and at most ⌊qn⌋ + c vertices.

For [formula], a cycle of length n shows that there exist n-vertex graphs with no non-empty q-full subgraphs on fewer than n vertices. We might try to circumvent this example by requiring a weaker degree condition: define a subgraph H of a graph G to be weakly q-full if dH(v)  ≥  ⌊qdG(v)⌋ for all v∈V(H). However even for this notion of q-fullness a natural generalization of Theorem [\ref=1/r-full] fails for rational [formula]: consider the second power of a cycle of length n. Then if x is a vertex in a weakly [formula]-full subgraph H, then all but at most one of its neighbors must also belong to H. Thus vertices not in H must lie at distance at least 5 apart in the original cycle, and H must contain at least [formula] vertices, rather than the [formula] we might have hoped for. It would be interesting to determine whether powers of paths or cycles provide us with the worst-case scenario for finding weakly q-full subgraphs when [formula].

Let [formula] be a fixed rational number. Determine whether there exist a constant cq  <  1 such that every n-vertex graph G has a weakly q-full subgraph with at least ⌊qn⌋ vertices and at most cqn vertices.

Notation

We use standard graph theoretic notation. In particular, if X,Y are sets of vertices of a graph G, then e(X) denotes the number of edges in the subgraph of G induced by X and e(X,Y) the number of edges with one end in X and the other end in Y. Denote by dX(x) the number of neighbors in X of a vertex x∈V(G). The Erds-Rényi random graph with edge-probability p on n vertices is denoted by Gn,p. If [formula] is a sequence of events, then we say An occurs asymptotically almost surely if [formula].

q-full subgraphs : Proofs of Theorems [\ref=relative] - [\ref=1/r-full]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=q-full_or_(1-q)-full]. Let G be a graph on n vertices, and let q∈[0,1] be fixed. Let [formula] be a bipartition of V(G) with |X|  =  ⌈qn⌉ and |Y|  =  ⌊(1 - q)n⌋ maximizing the value of (1 - q)e(X) + qe(Y).

If X is q-full or Y is (1 - q)-full, then we are done. Otherwise there exist x∈X and y∈Y with dX(x)  ≤  ⌈qdG(x)⌉ - 1 and dY(y)  ≤  ⌈(1 - q)dG(y)⌉ - 1. Let [formula] and [formula], and let [formula] if {x,y}∈E(G) and [formula] otherwise. Then

[formula]

Since [formula] maximized (1 - q)e(X) + qe(Y) over all bipartitions with |X|  =  ⌈qn⌉, |Y|  =  ⌊(1 - q)n⌋, we deduce from the inequality above that (a) dX(x) = ⌈qdG(x)⌉ - 1, dY(y)  =  ⌈(1 - q)dG(y)⌉ - 1, and, crucially, (b) {x,y}∈E(G).

Now denote by BX the set of x∈X with dX(x)  ≤  ⌈qdG(x)⌉ - 1 and BY the set of y∈Y with dY(y)  ≤  ⌈(1 - q)dG(y)⌉ - 1. By our assumption, both sets are non-empty. Our argument above establishes that (a) dX(x) = ⌈qdG(x)⌉ - 1 for all x∈BX, dY(y)  =  ⌈(1 - q)dG(y)⌉ - 1 for all y∈BY, and that (b) [formula] induces a complete bipartite subgraph of G. Thus for every x∈BX,y∈BY, [formula] is a q-full subgraph on ⌈qn⌉ + 1 vertices and [formula] is a (1 - q)-full subgraph on ⌊(1 - q)n⌋ + 1 vertices.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=relative]. Apply Theorem [\ref=q-full_or_(1-q)-full] with [formula].

Proof of Corollary [\ref=regular]. Suppose at least one of n,d is odd. By Theorem [\ref=relative], every d-regular graph has an m-vertex subgraph H with [formula] such that [formula] for every v∈V(H). Since for n,d not both even

[formula]

the subgraph H is a full subgraph.

In the case where both n and d are even, we need to use a slightly stronger form of Theorem [\ref=relative]. Note that in the proof of Theorem [\ref=q-full_or_(1-q)-full], we actually have one more condition in addition to (a) and (b), namely (c): (1 - q)dG(y) < ⌈(1 - q)dG(y)⌉ and qdG(x) < ⌈qdG(x)⌉ (else (1 - q)e(X') + qe(Y') > (1 - q)e(X) + qe(Y)). In the particular case where G is d-regular with d even and [formula], this condition (c) cannot be satisfied, and in particular one of the alternatives (i) or (ii) must hold in Theorem [\ref=q-full_or_(1-q)-full]. Thus G must contain a subgraph H on n / 2 vertices with minimum degree at least d / 2, which is a full subgraph.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=1/r-full] We use Theorem [\ref=q-full_or_(1-q)-full] and induction on r. The base case r = 1 is trivial, and Theorem [\ref=relative] deals with the case r = 2. Now apply Theorem [\ref=q-full_or_(1-q)-full] with [formula]: given a graph G on n vertices, this gives us a [formula]-full subgraph on [formula] or [formula] vertices (alternatives (i) and (iii)) or an [formula]-full subgraph H on [formula] vertices (alternative (ii)). In the latter case, we use our inductive hypothesis to find a [formula]-full subgraph H' of H on m vertices, for some [formula]. The subgraph H' is easily seen to be a [formula]-full subgraph of G, and so we are done.

A greedy algorithm : Proof of Theorem [\ref=greedy]

An obvious strategy for obtaining a full subgraph in a graph G of density p on n vertices is to repeatedly remove vertices of relatively low degree. When there are i vertices left in the graph, such a greedy algorithm finds a vertex of degree at most ⌈p(i  -  1)⌉  -  1 and deletes that vertex, unless no such vertex exists, in which case the i vertices induce a full subgraph. If G has positive discrepancy α, then we apply this algorithm in a subgraph H on m vertices with [formula] to obtain Theorem [\ref=greedy].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=greedy]. If G has positive discrepancy α > 0, then its edge density p is strictly less than 1. Let H be a subgraph of G with m vertices such that [formula]. At stage i we delete a vertex of degree at most ⌈p(m  -  i)⌉  -  1 in the remaining graph, or stop if no such vertex exists. The number of edges remaining after stage i is at least

[formula]

Therefore the greedy algorithm must terminate with a full subgraph on m  -  i vertices for some i satisfying [formula]. We conclude [formula].

The example of a clique with m vertices and n  -  m isolated vertices which shows that Theorem [\ref=greedy] is tight is the same example which shows [formula] for [formula]. We now prove that [formula] for [formula].

Proof [formula] for [formula]. First we show [formula] for all p:0  <  p  ≤  1. If m is defined by [formula], then the n-vertex graph G consisting of a subgraph of a clique of size m with [formula] edges, together with n  -  m isolated vertices has [formula]. Next we show that every n-vertex graph G of density p has a full subgraph with at least [formula] vertices if [formula]. Remove all isolated vertices from G. The number of isolated vertices is clearly at most [formula], otherwise the remaining graph has [formula] edges and less than [formula] vertices, which is impossible since this is denser than a complete graph. So we have a subgraph H with at least [formula] vertices and [formula] edges with no isolated vertices. Clearly H has a subgraph of minimum degree at least 1 with at least [formula] vertices and at most [formula] vertices, since addition of edges adds at most two vertices at a time. This subgraph is full since

[formula]

when [formula], as required.

Remarks. The analysis of the greedy algorithm in the proof of Theorem [\ref=greedy] above is not optimal; in fact by considering the asymptotic behavior of

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

For instance if say [formula], then [formula], as shown by Erds, L uczak and Spencer [\cite=ELS]. These lower bounds on fp(n) will be superseded by the better bounds given in Theorem [\ref=main].

We note that there exist examples of n-vertex graphs with edge density [formula] where greedily removing a vertex of minimal degree could yield a full subgraph of order only [formula]. Consider the graph G on V = {0,1,....,4n + 1} obtained by taking the [formula] power of the Hamiltonian cycle through [formula], adding edges between all antipodal pairs {i,i + (2n + 1)} (with addition modulo 4n + 2), and adding a complete bipartite graph Km,m with parts {0,1,...,m - 1} and {2n + 1,2n + 2,...,2n + m}, where [formula]. It is an easy exercise to show that by removing antipodal pairs of minimum degree vertices a greedy algorithm could fail to find a full subgraph until it has stripped the graph down to the planted complete bipartite graph Km,m.

A final remark is that every n-vertex graph G of density p with [formula] has an m-vertex subgraph with minimum degree at least [formula]. This is a consequence of the fact that every n-vertex graph of density p has positive discrepancy of order (1  -  p)n, due to inequality ([\ref=productdisc]), together with the bounds on fp(n) obtained above. The random graph Gn,p has no m-vertex subgraph of larger minimum degree, by standard concentration inequalities.

Proof of Theorems [\ref=eig] and [\ref=cofull]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=eig]. Let G be a graph on n vertices with λ(G)  =  λ, density p and positive discrepancy α. We show [formula]. Let X be a set of m vertices with [formula]. At stage t  ≥  1, we remove a vertex of X of degree strictly less than p(m  -  t) in the subgraph induced by X, if it exists, and otherwise we stop. Alon [\cite=Alon86] proved that if λ(G)  =  λ, then for every set Y  ⊆  V(G),

[formula]

By ([\ref=mixinglemma]), at each stage of the process we must have

[formula]

from which we deduce that the algorithm must terminate by stage t for some t satisfying λ(m  -  t)  ≥  α. This gives us a full subgraph on [formula] vertices.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=cofull]. Let G be an n-vertex graph. We use Theorem [\ref=eig] together with

[formula]

as proved by Bollobás and Nikiforov [\cite=BollobasNikiforov04]. By Theorem [\ref=eig],

[formula]

Since [formula] and [formula], we have +(G)  ≥  (G) or [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

Using the lower bounds on (G) and [formula] above, we obtain Theorem [\ref=cofull].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

Proof of [formula] for [formula] and c  ≥  1 fixed. It is convenient to let [formula]. Take a complete (r  +  1)-partite graph with parts [formula], and n vertices in each part, and for [formula], add a clique Ti of size k in Si, such that

[formula]

Let this graph be Gn. In particular, a calculation shows [formula]. Suppose H is a full subgraph of Gn with more than (r  +  1)k vertices, induced by sets Xi  ⊂  Si where Xi has size si for [formula]. By symmetry, we may assume [formula]. For a vertex v∈Si, let dj(v) denote the number of neighbors of v in Xj. Then for [formula], which is non-empty since t  >  k,

[formula]

On the other hand, since H is full,

[formula]

It follows that δrt  ≤  p, and since t  >  k, this implies [formula]. Since [formula], this is a contradiction and shows

[formula]

This proves the last statement of Theorem [\ref=main].

Proof of [formula] for [formula]. Let G be an n-vertex graph with density p. We repeatedly delete vertices of minimum degree to obtain a sequence of subgraphs [formula], with Gi having n - i + 1 vertices.

Let [formula] and di  =  ⌈p(n  -  i)⌉. Note that di is the minimum degree required for Gi to be full. Let t be a positive integer so that [formula], and let ri be the remainder when di is divided by 2t. For at least [formula] of the values i: 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, we have ri  ≤  (1 - p)2t. At stage i  ≤  m of the algorithm, we delete a vertex of minimum degree from Gi. If for some i  ≤  m such that ri  ≤  (1 - p)2t, all n - i + 1 vertices in the graph Gi have degree at least di  -  ri  +  1, then, by Theorem [\ref=1/r-full] (or Theorem [\ref=relative] applied t times), Gi has a [formula]-full subgraph H on N vertices, where

[formula]

Write di = q2t + ri. The minimum degree in H is

[formula]

For H to be a full subgraph of G we require D  ≥  p(N - 1). Now

[formula]

which is at most q + 1 since ri  ≤  (1 - p)2t. As this is less than our lower bound on D, H is a full subgraph of G. Our choice of t ensures

[formula]

On the other hand suppose that at every stage i  ≤  m of the greedy algorithm where ri  ≤  (1 - p)2t, we could remove a vertex of degree at most ⌈p(n  -  i)⌉  -  ri. Set I = {i  ≤  m: ri  ≤  (1 - p)2t}. We know that [formula]. What is more, I can be divided into intervals of consecutive indices i of length at most [formula], and over each of these intervals ri takes each of the value [formula] at least [formula] times. By considering [formula] on these intervals and using [formula], [formula], we get that:

[formula]

Then by Theorem [\ref=greedy] we have

[formula]

This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=main].

Remark. We did not optimize the constants in the proof of [formula], since it is unlikely that this argument gives an asymptotically tight lower bound on fp(n).

Concluding remarks

[formula] One motivation for studying half-full subgraphs, apart from their use in the proof of Theorem [\ref=main], is a random process on graphs known as majority bootstrap percolation: vertices of a graph are infected at time zero with probability p, and at any later time a vertex becomes infected if more than half of its neighbors are infected. A key quantity of interest in bootstrap percolation is the function θp(G), which is the probability that the process on the graph G infects all the vertices in finite time. The quantity θp(G) is precisely the probability that at time zero there is no half-full subgraph of uninfected vertices. One may ask the following:

Determine whether there exist p  >  0 and c  <  1 such that for every graph G, θp(G)  ≤  c.

In other words, is it the case that if the infection probability is too small (but still positive), then there is an absolute positive probability that on any graph G we fail to infect any vertex from some half-full subgraph (and hence that the infection does not spread to all vertices of G)? Recently, this was answered in the negative by Mitsche, Pérez-Giménez and Prałat [\cite=MPP], who given any arbitrarily small p > 0 constructed a sequence of regular graphs [formula] such that lim n  →    ∞θ(Gn)  =  0.

[formula] Hypergraphs. If G is an n-vertex r-uniform hypergraph of density p, then an m-vertex subhypergraph H of G is full if for every v∈V(H), [formula]. We may define f(G) to be the largest number of vertices in a full subgraph of an r-uniform hypergraph G of density p, and let

[formula]

It is straightforward to imitate the proof of Theorem [\ref=main] to show for certain values of p∈(0,1) that [formula]. We leave open the problem of determining the tightness of this upper bound, as well as of giving bounds on frp(n) when p decays as n grows:

Determine the order of magnitude of frp(n) for p = p(n) and r  ≥  3.

The greedy algorithm from Section [\ref=proofofgreedy] generalizes to r-uniform hypergraphs, in which it yields a full subgraph of order only [formula]. The results on q-full subgraphs (Section [\ref=section:_qfull]) on the other hand do not however seem to generalize in an easy way to the hypergraph setting; explicitly, say that a subgraph F of an r-uniform hypergraph H is q-full if dF(v)  ≥  qr - 1dH(v) for every v∈V(F). Perhaps it is true that every n-vertex r-uniform hypergraph has a q-full subgraph with ⌊qn⌋  +  O(1) vertices, but we do not have a proof even for [formula] and r  =  3. Complete hypergraphs show that if this is true, then it is best possible. We leave this as an open problem.

[formula] Digraphs. We could also ask about directed graphs. Since every subgraph of a transitive tournament has a vertex of indegree zero and a vertex of outdegree zero, it is more fruitful to ask about extensions of Theorem [\ref=relative] than of Theorem [\ref=main]. Let d+H(v) denote the outdegree of a vertex v∈H. A subgraph H of a directed graph D is q-out-full if for every v∈H we have d+H(v)  ≥  qd+D(v). Then the problem is to determine the smallest function h(n,q) such that every digraph on n vertices has a q-out-full subgraph with at most h(n,q) vertices.

[formula] Weighted graphs. A weighted graph is a pair W = (V,w), where w: V(2)  →  [0,1] is a weighting of pairs of vertices from V. The edge-density p of W is then the average pair-weight under w, and the degree dY(x) of x in a subset Y  ⊆  V is the sum over all y∈Y of w({x,y}). Our definitions of full subgraphs carry over to the weighted graph setting in the natural way, and we can ask:

Let W be a weighted graph. Determine the largest number of vertices in a full subgraph of W.

We may similarly ask about q-full subgraphs for q∈[null]: what is the smallest c such that every n-vertex weighted graph has a q-full subgraph with at most ⌊qn⌋  +  c vertices? We note here that the proof of Theorem [\ref=main] carries over to the weighted setting modulo a weighted version of Theorem [\ref=relative]. The proof of Theorem [\ref=relative] itself, however, does not transfer in an obvious way to the weighted setting.

[formula] Computational complexity. It appears likely that the following computational problems, which we have not investigated, are of similar complexity to Max Cut:

find a largest full subgraph of G;

given an integer k, determine whether or not G contains a full subgraph on k vertices;

given an integer k, find a k-vertex subgraph with largest minimum degree.

The problem of finding (an approximation to) the densest subgraph of order k has received a significant amount of attention from the computer science community (see e.g. [\cite=BhaskaracharikaChlamtacFeigeVijayaraghavan10] [\cite=FeigePelegKortsarz01]), including in some variants involving degree constraints [\cite=AminiPelegPerennesSauSaurabh09]. From an algorithmic perspective, we thus expect that problems (i)-(iii) above will be hard: densest subgraph of order k is known to be NP-Hard. Further, examples due to Schäffer and Yannakakis [\cite=SchafferYannakakis91] and Monien and Tscheuschner [\cite=MonienTscheuschner10] for weighted versions of the Max-Cut problem suggest that local search (i.e. algorithms based on flipping vertices between a k-set X whose minimum degree we are trying to maximize and its complement) could take exponential time to converge to a local optimum for problem (iii) (see also the work Poljak [\cite=Poljak95]). We note that the proofs of the theorems in this paper lead to polynomial time algorithms in each case.
