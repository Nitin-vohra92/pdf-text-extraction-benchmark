Creation of superposition of unknown quantum states

The existence of superpositions of pure quantum states is one of the most intriguing consequences of the postulates of quantum mechanics. Quantum superpositions are crucial for the path-integral formulation of quantum mechanics [\cite=Feynman2005] and are responsible for numerous nonclassical phenomena that are considered to be the key features of quantum theory [\cite=Schroedinger1935]. The prominent examples are: quantum interference [\cite=Anderson1998] [\cite=Zeilinger1999] [\cite=Wineland2013] and quantum entanglement [\cite=Schroedinger1935a]. Coherent addition of wavefunctions is also responsible for quantum coherence, a feature of quantum states that recently received a lot of attention [\cite=Baumgratz2014] [\cite=Streltsov2015] [\cite=Winter2015]. Quantum superpositions are not only important from the foundational point of view but also a feature of quantum mechanics that underpins the existence of ultra-fast quantum algorithms (such as Shor factoring algorithm [\cite=Shor1997] or Grover search algorithm [\cite=Grover1996]), quantum cryptography [\cite=Gisin2002] and efficient quantum metrology [\cite=Giovannetti2011].

The importance of quantum superpositions provokes questions about the restrictions that quantum mechanics itself imposes on the possibility of their generation. Studies of the limitations of the possible operations allowed by quantum mechanics have a long tradition are important both from the fundamental perspective as well as for the applications in quantum information theory. On one hand quantum mechanics offers a number of protocols that either outperform all existing classical counterparts or even allow to perform tasks that are impossible in the classical theory (such as quantum teleportation [\cite=Bennett1993]). On the other hand a number of no-go theorems [\cite=Wootters1982] [\cite=Dieks1982] [\cite=Barnum1996] [\cite=Pati2000] [\cite=Pati2002] [\cite=Piani2008] restrict a class of protocols that are possible to realise within quantum mechanics. Finally, such no-go theorems can be themselves useful for practical purposes. For instance a no-clonning theorem can be used to certify the security of quantum cryptographic protocols [\cite=Gisin2002].

In this paper, we consider the scenario in which we are given two unknown pure quantum states and our task is to create, using the most general operations allowed by quantum mechanics, their superposition with some complex weights. Essentially the same question was posed in a parallel work of Alvarez-Rodriguez et al. [\cite=Alvarez-Rodriguez2014]: namely the authors asked about the existence of quantum adder - a machine, that would superpose two registers with the plus sign.

Here, we first prove a no-go theorem, showing that it is impossible to create superposition of two unknown states. We discuss the relation of our theorem with the no-go results of [\cite=Alvarez-Rodriguez2014]. Subsequently, we provide a protocol that probabilistically creates superposition of two states having fixed nonzero overlaps with some referential state. We show that, by using appropriate encoding, the protocol can be used to generate superpositions of unknown vectors from the subspace perpendicular to the referential state, thus allowing for generation of coherent superpositions of the results of quantum subroutines of a given quantum algorithm. This actually shows how to circumvent our no-go theorem to some extent. We also discuss optical implementation of the protocol, with the referential state being the vacuum state. Finally, we discuss the differences between our results, and analogous results concerning cloning.

Introduction

Before we proceed we need to carefully analyse the concept of quantum superpositions. Recall first that the global phase of a wavefunction is not a physically accessible quantity. This redundancy can be removed when one interprets pure states as one dimensional orthogonal projectors acting on the relevant Hilbert space. In what follows the pure state corresponding to a normalized vector [formula] will be denoted by [formula]. Normalized vectors that rise to the same pure state [formula] are called vector representatives of [formula]. They are defined up to a global phase i.e. [formula] if and only if [formula], for some phase θ. Let now α,β be complex numbers satisfying |α|2 + |β|2 = 1 and let [formula], [formula] be two pure states. By [formula] we denote the projector onto the superposition of [formula] and [formula]

[formula]

where [formula] is a normalization factor. The crucial observation is that [formula] is not a well-defined function of the states [formula] and [formula]. This is because [formula] depends on vector representatives ,   , whose phases can be gauged independently. Consequently, we have the infinite family of pure states

[formula]

Part C: Constructive protocol for superposition of multiple states

In this part we generalize the protocol presented in the proof of Theorem 2 to the case of multiple superpositions.

First, we generalize the formula (6). Assume that we are given a known pure stet [formula] and d unknown pure states [formula] satisfying

[formula]

We now introduce the mapping [formula] that would associate to any sequence of such pure states their superposition. Let [formula] be a vector representative of [formula] and let [formula], , be vector representatives of states [formula], [formula] . For a given sequence of complex coefficients [formula] (satisfying [formula]) we set

[formula]

The above formula is a direct generalization of (6) and analogous arguments show that [formula] is a well-defined function of states [formula]. This can be also seen from the explicit formula

[formula]

where

[formula]

where it is understood that the product of operators indexed by the empty set is the identity operator.

In the context of geometric approaches to quantum mechanics [\cite=Chaturvedi2013] [\cite=Ercolessi2010] [\cite=Manko2002] there appears the following superposition rule,

[formula]

For d > 2 the mappings

[formula]

differ from each other. It would be interesting to explore the geometric significance of the superposition rule used by us. Also, It would be interesting to explore if states of the form [\eqref=eq:alternativesuperp] can be generated by processes allowed by quantum mechanics

Let [formula] be a fixed pure state on Hilbert space H and let d > 1 be a natural number. There exist a CP map [formula] such that for all pure states [formula], on H satisfying

[formula]

we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

is an unknown qdit state and the vector [formula] is given by ([\ref=eq:multiple_superposition]). Moreover, a CP map Λdsup realising ([\ref=eq:condition_superp_multi]) is unique up scaling.

We present an explicit protocol that realizes ([\ref=eq:condition_superp_multi]) which is analogous to the one given in the proof of Theorem 2. Let us first define and auxiliary normalized qdit vector

[formula]

where Cd is a normalization constant. We set [formula], where In the above [formula] denotes the unitary operator that swaps between first and i'th copy of the Hilbert space[formula], [formula] and [formula] are identity operators on [formula] and H respectively, [formula] is the partial trace over all except for the second factor in the tensor product [formula]. Operation Λdsup is manifestly completely positive and trace non-increasing. Direct calculation shows that under the assumed conditions ([\ref=eq:condition_superp_multi]) indeed holds. The proof of uniqueness of the map Λdsup is analogous to the one given in the case d = 2 (covered by Theorem 2).

Part D: Creation of superpositions of results of subroutines of quantum computations run in parallel

Here we show how to implement the protocol coherently superposing results of subroutines of quantum computation in the standard quantum circuit formalism. Assume we want to superpose states [formula], [formula] that correspond to application of some quantum circuts on N qbits (the Hilbert space of the system [formula]) ,

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] are classical states encoding the cinput to the the computation,

[formula]

and U,V are unitary operators on [formula]. We introduce the auxiliary qubit that will allow us to encode the state [formula] without altering the computation (from now on we will consider the Hilbert space [formula]). We set [formula] and we introduce new initial states as projectors onto vectors By applying the controlled versions of the unitaries U,V,

[formula]

we obtain the states represented by the vectors These vectors are exactly of the form given by (16) and thus we can apply to them protocol from the main text of the manuscript (keep in mind that we set [formula]) that with the probability

[formula]

will produce a state having a vector representative

[formula]

Note that from the state [\eqref=eq:compsuperpos] it is possible to extract (by postselecting with respect to obtaining the result "1" in the auxiliary qbit) the state encoding the superposition U + V in the computational register.

Let us discuss the method presented above. First of all, in order to be able to create the desired superpositions we need to encode input states in the extended space (see [\eqref=eq:encoding1]) and use the controlled versions of the gates U,V (see [\eqref=eq:encunit]). The controlled versions of the unitary gate are defined up to a phase standing next to the unitary which is controlled [\cite=Bisio2015] and therefore we can always add an additional phase in front of the second terms in the sums [\eqref=eq:encodres]. However, this is not a problem as we can always decode (probabilistically) the original computation from states of the form [\eqref=eq:encodres]. Another possible problem may come form the necessity of implementing the controlled versions of gates U,V. This can be always done if one knows the classical description of these gates. In particular, assume that the N qbit gate U can be decomposed as a sequence of basic gates [formula] ,

[formula]

Then, a controlled version of of this gate can be obtained by composing controlled versions of the basic gates,

[formula]

For the graphical illustration of the preperation of the state [formula] see Figure [\ref=fig:circuit].

To sum up, the protocol presented above creates superpositions of results of subroutines of quantum computations run in parallel with probability [formula]. In order to implement the method one has to know what quantum subroutines are implemented. However, the inputs of the computations can be arbitrary (there are no constrains on the classical input states [formula] and [formula]).
