The cycle index of the automorphism group of [formula]

Introduction

Let [formula] be the automorphism group of the cyclic additive group of residues modulo n. Throughout this paper, we treat [formula] interchangeably, merely as a set [formula] or as the additive, cyclic group. However, the context in which it is used will clearly determine its meaning.

As it is well known, Un is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of those integers in [formula] that are relatively prime to n, i.e.

[formula]

Based on that isomorphism, a mapping πa∈Un, can be identified with an element [formula], (a,n) = 1. Further, we will be frequently using that convenient isomorphic correspondence, without risk of misconception. Hence, the natural group action of the group Un on the set of elements of [formula] could be seen as

[formula]

Clearly, the automorphism group, Un, represented in the described way is a permutation group acting on n points. Although elementary in its nature, it was surprising fact that, to the best of our knowledge, the cycle index of the described group action is still missing. Besides PhD thesis, [\cite=Boz-thesis], in which the problem is treated to some extent, there is only one paper, [\cite=Wei], that partially deals with the similar group action, and yet substantially different. Therefore, finding the cycle index, [formula], of the described group action emerges as the main goal of this paper.

Based on somewhat distinct, although complement approaches, we get two forms of the same result. The first one that looks more general, whereas another one is technically more detailed, supplying raw structure of cycle index [formula]. In the first approach, we get nice, compact result from the Corollary [\ref=nice-compact]

[formula]

where ra(d) is a multiplicative order of an integer a∈Un modulo d.

In the second approach, we use the fact of the direct decomposition of additive abelian group and corresponding decomposition of its automorphism group

[formula]

As n can be decomposed as a product of prime number powers, then we proceed by finding cycle index [formula], for a prime number p and [formula], as a groundwork for utilization of known result given in [\cite=HarHigh], that is an algorithm for finding cycle index of direct product of permutation groups.

Once the cycle index is found, there is a vast class of enumerative and combinatorial problems that could be related to it. For example, one of the classical enumerative, combinatorial "targets" is a number of orbits or equivalence classes of subsets of [formula].

Preliminaries

In this section, we bring up some basic, auxiliary results, notation and assumptions that will be used for the rest of the paper.

By natural number we assume positive integer.

By [formula] we denote disjoint union of sets.

The label φ will be exclusively used for the Euler's phi function.

By Cn we denote a cyclic group of n elements.

By [formula] we denote the full symmetric group on the set M.

By (a,b) we denote gcd (a,b) and by

[formula]

Regarding a topic of group action, we slightly changed definitions of classical notions and accordingly, introduce some new notation.

(Type of a Permutation) Let P be a set with |P|  =  n. A permutation [formula] is of the type [formula], iff π can be written as the composition of λi disjointed cycles of length i, for [formula]. Hence, by λi(π) we mean the number of cycles of length i in the decomposition of π into disjoint cycles. Shortly, we write

[formula]

Note that variable xi has only formal meaning, referring to the cycle of the length i.

(Partial Cycle Index) Let P be a set of |P|  =  n elements and let Γ be a subset of finite permutation group GP acting on P. The partial cycle index of a subset Γ  ⊆  GP is defined as a polynomial in n indeterminates [formula], defined as:

[formula]

When Γ  =  GP, then Z(GP,P)(GP) is called the cycle index of GP on P, or shortly Z(GP,P).

It should be emphasized that a natural number n, in the previous definition, is upper limit regarding the number of indeterminates of cycle index polynomial. The actuall number of indeterminates that could appear in the cycle index polynomial is λ(n), that is the maximal order among of all orders of elements in GP.

Directly from the previous definition, we have this simple observation.

Let GP be a permutation group acting on a set P of n elements and a Γi  ⊆  GP, [formula], where [formula], be a set partition of the set of elements of GP. Then, the cycle index of GP on P is

[formula]

It is direct consequence of the Definition [\ref=partial-cycle-index-defn] and the fact that GP is disjoint union of Γi, [formula], i.e.

[formula]

Note that Γ in the previous definition is a subset, not necessarily a subgroup of GP. This notion of partial cycle index will be helpful later.

Let us introduce the notion of (r,k) - coprime residue set in [formula].

Let r,k be natural numbers such that gcd (r,k) = 1, r < k and let k be a divisor of natural number n. The set of integers

[formula]

is called (r,k) - coprime residue set in [formula].

We prove that any (r,k) - coprime set in [formula] is not empty. It is essentially a restatement and slight modification of the result given in Lemma 2, page 32, [\cite=Cohn]. This result will be helpful later, in characterization of orbits of the examined group action.

Let [formula] be natural numbers such that gcd (r,k) = 1, r < k and [formula]. Then (r,k)-coprime set Urn(k) is nonempty.

We prove for given r,k and n and gcd (r,k) = 1, there exists t such that

[formula]

Let pvii be a general prime power divisor of n. Then, there exists ti such that

[formula]

Namely, if pi|k, then [formula] and ti = 0 suffices. If [formula], than any number ti such that

[formula]

will work. By Chinese Reminder Theorem, there exists t such that

[formula]

and gcd (r + kt,n) = 1. We need to prove that there exists x∈Un such that [formula]. Let [formula]. Since k|n then [formula]. Also, it is easy to see that gcd (x,n) = 1 and therefore x∈Un.

The following lemma, almost textbook statement, we introduce without proof.

Let Cn  =  〈a〉 be a cyclic group of n elements and let [formula] be an integer such that d|n. By Ad denote the set of all elements of Cn of order d. Then,

[formula]

Apparently |Ad| = φ(d). Also, Cn is disjoint union of those sets, that is

[formula]

Let Ωdn, where d|n, be the set of elements of additive order d in the [formula]. Then, according to Lemma [\ref=genistcikl], we have

[formula]

and |Ωdn| = φ(d). The partition of [formula], we just specified, will play important role in the analysis of the group action we are dealing with.

Cycle index of Un - general case

As pointed in the Introduction, we consider the natural group action of the group Un on the set of elements of [formula], given by

[formula]

Based on results in the previous section, we prove that the typical orbit of the aforementioned group action is actually Ωdn, that is the set of elements of additive order d in the [formula].

Let d, n be natural numbers, such that d|n. Then

[formula]

Also, Ωdn is an orbit under the action of the group Un on [formula].

The first fact of the claim is trivial consequence of Lemma [\ref=genistcikl], so we have

[formula]

We prove that Ωdn is an orbit in the action of Un on [formula]. Let x and y be elements of order d. Then we have x = (n / d)k1 and y = (n / d)k2 where k1,k2∈Ud. Therefore, there exists k∈Ud and k1 = kk2.

On the other hand, Lemma [\ref=induklema] claims that Ukn(d) is nonempty, i.e. the existence of an element h∈Un such that [formula]. Clearly [formula]. By multiplying both sides by (n / d) we have

[formula]

Thus, Un is transitive on the set of elements of (additive) order d.

Let a, d be natural numbers such that gcd (a,d) = 1. Denote by ra(d) the order of a with respect to modulo d, i.e.

[formula]

The following lemma has a key role in a description of how the mapping [formula], defined as πa(x) = ax mod n, acts on a typical orbit Ωdn.

Let d,n,a be natural numbers such that d|n and gcd (a,n) = 1. Consider [formula], that is restriction of the mapping [formula], defined as πa(x) = ax mod n, on Ωdn. In other words,

[formula]

Then, τ is a permutation of Ωdn and

[formula]

We know, from Lemma [\ref=transitonzn], that Ωdn is an orbit of πa, so we conclude that τ:Ωdn  →  Ωdn. Since, πa is a bijection, then τ is certainly injection on Ωdn. However, Ωdn is finite set, so τ must be bijection.

According to Lemma [\ref=transitonzn], an arbitrary element c∈Ωdn is of the form

[formula]

Let us consider the cycle that c belong to, considering the mapping τ and let s be the length of that cycle

[formula]

From [formula] it follows

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Since s is the least number such that [formula], then s  ≤  k.

On the other hand, from [formula], it follows

[formula]

Since, gcd (v,d) = 1, we conclude [formula]. However, k = ra(d) and thus k  ≤  s, so we finally get k = s. Since c is an arbitrary element in Ωdn, we conclude that every cycle of τ is of the same length k = ra(d).

Let n,a be natural numbers such that d|n and gcd (a,n) = 1. Then, bijection [formula], defined as πa(x) = ax mod n, has cyclic structure

[formula]

Accordingly, the cycle index of Un, acting on the set [formula], is

[formula]

We should notice that the number of indeterminates in the polynomial [formula] is actually equal to the maximal multiplicative order among elements in Un, that is

[formula]

As it is principally analysed and resolved in [\cite=Char], for a natural number n represented as a product of powers of prime numbers [formula], we have that λ(n) is equal to the least common multiplier of λ(peii), for [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Therefore, only indeterminates [formula] appear in the cycle index [formula].

Cycle index of Upm

In this section, we present more comprehensive look over the cycle index of the group Upm acting on [formula]. Since the algebraic structure of Upm differs in two basic cases: when p = 2 and when p is an odd prime number, we will consider the same two cases in the course of finding cycle index of Un.

Once a cycle index of Upm, for a prime number p, is found, it will serve as a building block for compounding cycle index of Un, where n is naturally represented as a product of powers of prime numbers.

Cycle index of U2m

We start with the case of U2m acting on [formula]. First of all, we need to determine how elements of U2m look like, considering the fact that it is not a cyclic group for m  ≥  3, but direct product C2  ×  C2m - 2. Still, there is a way for all elements of U2m to be represented in functional form.

An integer a is said to be a semi-primitive root modulo n if the order of a modulo n is equal to φ(n) / 2, where φ is Euler function.

It is shown in [\cite=Gauss] that 3 is a semi-primitive root modulo 2m. Thus, the order of 3 modulo 2m is 2m - 2, for any integer m  ≥  3 and

[formula]

Then, the following lemma is just rewording of the previous fact.

For an arbitrary element w∈U2m, if m  ≥  3, there exists unique pair (a,b), a∈{0,1} and [formula] such that

[formula]

It might be useful to mention that 5 is a semi-primitive for U2m, m  ≥  3 as well.

The claims of the following two corollaries are either obvious or directly coming from the Lemma [\ref=generator-3].

Let a = 32sr, d = 2l, where l  ≥  1, s  ≥  0, [formula]. Then

[formula]

Let a =  - 32sr, d = 2l, where l  ≥  1, s  ≥  0, [formula]. Then

[formula]

Let us consider

[formula]

as a subset of the group U2m, for m  ≥  3. Then, the partial cycle index of this set is

[formula]

Since all orbits of the multiplicative action of the group U2m on [formula] are of the form

[formula]

where 0  ≤  l  ≤  m, it is important to find out behaviour of particular mappings

[formula]

on those orbits. As stated before, we are interested in ctypes of those mappings on Ω2l2m. In order to find ctype of mappings 32sr is restricted on orbit Ω2l2m we use results of Corollary [\ref=rd-plus3-nam].

Firstly, all elements from Γ1 are fixing Ω12m  =  {0} and Ω22m  =  {2m - 1} as one-element orbits.

By considering parameter l in the result of Corollary [\ref=rd-plus3-nam], we differentiate two major cases: when l < 3 and when l  ≥  3. Accordingly, the orbits

[formula]

should be treated separately.

For example, for the mappings of the form 3r, where [formula], we have

[formula]

The total number of these mappings from Γ1 is 2m - 3.

For those mappings from Γ1 of the form 32sr, when s  ≥  1, we have

[formula]

The total number of these elements is 2m - 3 - s. clearly, for r = 0, we get identity and ctype of it is x2m1.

Finally, by adding all them together, after some elementary algebraic manipulation, we get a partial cycle index of the subset Γ1

[formula]

Let us consider

[formula]

as a subset of the group U2m, for m  ≥  3. Then, the partial cycle index of this set is

[formula]

Similarly, as in the proof of the Lemma [\ref=gama1-parni], we use the result from Corollary [\ref=rd-minus3-nam]. Note that

[formula]

By using same type of reasoning used to prove Lemma [\ref=gama1-parni] we get the result.

Let Γ1 and Γ2 be subsets of the group U2m, m  ≥  3, as it has been introduced in the lemmas [\ref=gama1-parni] and [\ref=gamma2-parni]. Then

[formula]

According to the Lemma [\ref=generator-3], every number from U2m, if not - 1 or 1, has a form

[formula]

so [formula]. Also, from the same lemma it follows that [formula]. Hence, [formula] is disjoint union and equal to U2m.

The cycle index [formula] of the permutation group U2m acting on [formula] is

[formula]

The claim follows trivially for m = 1 and m = 2. For the case m  ≥  3, we use results given in Lemma [\ref=gama1-parni] and Lemma [\ref=gamma2-parni], combined with the fact given in Corollary [\ref=partition-u-2m], that

[formula]

Cycle index od Upm - p an odd, prime number

The following lemma considers the case of Upm, where p is an od prime number. As it has been already noted, this group is cyclic and consequently, it is much easier to find its cycle index.

Let p be an odd prime. The cycle type of the permutation group Upm acting on [formula] is

[formula]

where

[formula]

It is well known that in the case of odd prime p, the automorphism group Upm is cyclic [\cite=Zass]. Let β be a generator of Upm. Then, [formula]. It is elementary fact that in an arbitrary group G and g∈G, such that [formula] it holds that

[formula]

Since rβ(pi) = φ(pi), for [formula], we conclude that

[formula]

Now, the claim follows directly from the result ([\ref=cycle-index-compact]) given in the Corollary [\ref=nice-compact].

Cycle index of direct product of permutation groups

Since we found the cycle indices of all groups Upm when p is a prime number, there is a natural question if there exists a way to combine them together in order to obtain the cycle index of Un, where n is the product of those prime power components. Hence, we need something like the cycle index of the direct product of permutation groups.

Let G1,G2 be permutation groups acting on sets X1,X2 respectively. Let G = G1  ×  G2 and X = X1  ×  X2 be the direct product of corresponding groups and sets. For an element x = (x1,x2) of X and an element g = (g1,g2) of G, we define the action of g on x by

[formula]

Evidently, G is a permutation group on X. Let P and Q be polynomials

[formula]

[formula]

In [\cite=HarHigh] the following product operator was defined

[formula]

where

[formula]

We need the following lemma. For proof, see [\cite=HarHigh] and [\cite=Wei].

The cycle index of the natural action of permutation group G1  ×  G2 on X1  ×  X2 induced by actions G1 on X1 and G2 on X2 can be expressed as:

[formula]

Let [formula]. Applying the ring isomorphism

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

Hence, according to Lemma [\ref=prodpermgroup], we have

[formula]

Since cycle indices of prime power components are given in Lemma [\ref=zaparne-total] and Lemma [\ref=zaneparne-total], the cycle index [formula] can be calculated as above.

Let us find the cycle index of U60. Frome lemmas [\ref=zaparne-total] and [\ref=zaneparne-total] we know that

[formula]

Therefore, and according to Lemma [\ref=prodpermgroup]

[formula]

Firstly, we calculate product of the first two cycle indices, that actually is [formula]. So,

Finally, we get

Certainly, the same result would be obtained by simple application of the formula ([\ref=cycle-index-compact]) in the Corollary [\ref=nice-compact].

Conclusions

In this paper we studied the group action of the automorphism group [formula] on the set [formula], that is the set of residue classes modulo n. The main goal of the paper was to find the cycle index of that action. Based on some elementary number theory and algebraic techniques, we get nice, compact result in the Corollary [\ref=nice-compact]. Also, in the Lemma [\ref=zaparne-total] and Lemma [\ref=zaneparne-total], we provided technically more detailed look at the building blocks of cycle index of the studied group action.

In the further research, as we announced in the Introduction, it could be interesting to examine some combinatorial problems as a problem of finding the number of orbits or equivalence classes of subsets of [formula]. Namely, there is a natural way to induce the discussed group action on the set Ok, standing for the set of all subsets of [formula] of size k  ≤  n and then the task could be principally resolved by Pólya's theory application as in [\cite=Polya] [\cite=Bruij] [\cite=SurPol].

It is worth of mentioning that the number of orbits of sets of Ok is related to the problem of factorizations of abelian groups into direct product of subsets that is examined in [\cite=Szabo] [\cite=Sands] [\cite=Boz]. Hence, it seems that some further research in this topic could be very fruitful.
