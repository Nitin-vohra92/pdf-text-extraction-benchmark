The class of Appell sequences is an important class of polynomial sequences and very often found in different applications in pure and applied mathematics. Properties of Appell sequences are naturally handled within the framework of modern classical umbral calculus by Roman [\cite=Roman]. The classical Bernoulli polynomials Bn(x), the classical Euler polynomials En(x) and the classical Genocchi polynomials Gn(x), together with their familiar generalizations B(m)n(x), E(m)n(x) and G(m)n(x) of (real or complex) order m, belong to the class of Appell sequences.

The polynomials B(m)n(x), E(m)n(x) and G(m)n(x) are defined by the following generating functions [\cite=Erd3] [\cite=Sandor]:

Motivated by the above mentioned work on symmetry identities for 1-variable Apostol polynomials and due to the importance of the 2-variable forms of the special polynomials in this paper, we derived symmetric identities for the 2-variable Apostol type polynomials. Symmetric identities for certain members belonging to this family are also obtained.

In this section, we derive several symmetric identities for the 2-variable Apostol type polynomials. For this we prove the following theorems:

Theorem 2.1.  For all integers [formula], the following symmetry identity for the 2-variable Apostol type polynomials pF(m)n(x,y;λ;μ,ν) holds true:

By taking suitable values of the parameters in equation (2.1) and (2.5) and in view of relations (1.12)-(1.14), we can find the symmetric identities for other mixed special polynomials related to pF(m)n(x,y;λ;μ,ν). We present the symmetric identities for these polynomials in the following table:

Note. We note that for λ = 1, the results derived in Table 2.1 for the 2VABP [formula], 2VAEP [formula] and 2VAGP pG(m)n(x,y;λ) give the corresponding results for the 2-variable Bernoulli polynomials (2VBP) (of order m) pB(m)n(x,y), 2-variable Euler polynomials (2VEP) (of order m) pE(m)n(x,y) and 2-variable Genocchi polynomials (2VGP) (of order m) pG(m)n(x,y), respectively. We present these results in the Table 2.2:

Note. We note that for m = 1, the results derived above for the 2-variable Bernoulli polynomials (2VBP) (of order m) pB(m)n(x,y), 2-variable Euler polynomials (2VEP) (of order m) pE(m)n(x,y) and 2-variable Genocchi polynomials (2VGP)(of order m) pG(m)n(x,y) give the corresponding results for the 2-variable Bernoulli polynomials (2VBP) pBn(x,y), 2-variable Euler polynomials (2VEP) pEn(x,y) and 2-variable Genocchi polynomials (2VGP) pGn(x,y).

In the next section, symmetry identities for certain members belonging to the 2-variable Apostol type polynomials are obtained.

Certain members belonging to the 2VATP pF(m)n(x,y;λ;μ,ν) family are considered in [\cite=ATP]. These special members are obtained by making suitable choice for the function φ(y,t) in equation (1.15).

We recall that by taking φ(y,t) = eyts (for which the 2VGP pn(x,y) reduce to the Gould-Hopper polynomials (GHP) H(s)n(x,y)) in the l.h.s. of generating function (1.15), we get the following generating function for the Gould-Hopper Apostol type polynomials [formula] [\cite=ATP]:

[formula]

Consequently, by taking φ(y,cdt) = ey(cdt)s in equation (2.2) and proceeding on the same lines as in Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 2.2, we get the following consequences of Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 2.2.

Corollary 3.1.  For all integers [formula], the following symmetry identity for the Gould-Hopper Apostol type polynomials H(s)F(m)n(x,y;λ;μ,ν) holds true:

[formula]

By taking suitable values of the parameters in equation (3.2) and (3.3) and in view of relations (1.12)-(1.14), we can find the symmetric identities for other mixed special polynomials related to H(s)F(m)n(x,y;λ;μ,ν). We present the symmetric identities for these polynomials in the following table:

Table 3.1. Symmetry identities for the Special cases of the GHATP H(s)F(m)n(x,y;λ;μ,ν)

Note. We note that for λ = 1, the symmetry identities derived above for the GHABP [formula], GHAEP [formula] and GHAGP H(s)G(m)n(x,y;λ) give the corresponding identities for the Gould-Hopper Bernoulli polynomials (GHBP) (of order m) H(s)B(m)n(x,y), Gould-Hopper Euler polynomials (GHEP) (of order m) H(s)E(m)n(x,y) and Gould-Hopper Genocchi polynomials (GHGP) (of order m) H(s)G(m)n(x,y), respectively. Again, for m = 1, we get the corresponding identities for the Gould-Hopper Bernoulli polynomials (GHBP) H(s)Bn(x,y), Gould-Hopper Euler polynomials (GHEP) H(s)En(x,y) and Gould-Hopper Genocchi polynomials (GHGP) H(s)Gn(x,y).

Next, by taking φ(y,t) = C0( - yts) (for which the 2VGP pn(x,y) reduce to the 2-variable generalized Laguerre polynomials (2VGLP) sLn(y,x)) in the l.h.s. of generating function (1.15), we get the following generating function for the 2-variable generalized Laguerre Apostol type polynomials [formula] [\cite=ATP]:

[formula]

Consequently, by taking φ(y,cdt) = C0( - y(cdt)s) in equation (2.2) and proceeding on the same lines as in Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 2.2, we get the following consequences of Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 2.2.

Corollary 3.3.  For all integers [formula], the following symmetry identity for the 2-variable generalized Laguerre Apostol type polynomials sLF(m)n(x,y;λ;μ,ν) holds true:

[formula]

[formula]

By taking suitable values of the parameters in equation (3.2) and (3.3) and in view of relations (1.12)-(1.14), we can find the symmetric identities for other mixed special polynomials related to sLF(m)n(x,y;λ;μ,ν). We present the symmetric identities for these polynomials in the following table:

Table 3.2. Symmetry identities for the Special cases of the 2VGLATP sLF(m)n(x,y;λ;μ,ν)

Note. We note that for λ = 1, the symmetry derived above for the 2VGLABP [formula], 2VGLAEP [formula] and 2VGLAGP sLG(m)n(x,y;λ) give the corresponding identities for the 2-variable generalized Laguerre Bernoulli polynomials (2VGLBP) (of order m) sLB(m)n(x,y), 2-variable generalized Laguerre Euler polynomials (2VGLEP) (of order m) sLE(m)n(x,y) and 2-variable generalized Laguerre Genocchi polynomials (2VGLGP) (of order m) sLG(m)n(x,y), respectively. Again, for m = 1, we get the corresponding identities for the 2-variable generalized Laguerre Bernoulli polynomials (2VGLBP) sLBn(x,y), 2-variable generalized Laguerre Euler polynomials (2VGLEP) sLEn(x,y) and 2-variable generalized Laguerre Genocchi polynomials (2VGLGP) sLGn(x,y).

Similarly, by taking [formula] (for which the 2VGP pn(x,y) reduce to the 2-variable truncated exponential polynomials (2VTE) e(r)n(x,y)) in the l.h.s. of generating function (1.15), we get the following generating function for the 2-variable truncated exponential Apostol type polynomials [formula] [\cite=ATP]:

[formula]

Consequently, by taking [formula] in equation (2.2) and proceeding on the same lines as in Theorem 2.1, we get the following consequence of Theorem 2.1.

Corollary 3.5.  For all integers [formula], the following symmetry identity for the 2-variable truncated exponential Apostol type polynomials e(r)F(m)n(x,y;λ;μ,ν) holds true:

[formula]

Corollary 3.6.  For each pair of positive integers c, ~ d and for all integers [formula], the following symmetry identity for the 2-variable truncated exponential Apostol type polynomials e(r)F(m)n(x,y;λ;μ,ν) holds true:

[formula]

By taking suitable values of the parameters in equation (3.2) and (3.3) and in view of relations (1.12)-(1.14), we can find the symmetric identities for other mixed special polynomials related to e(r)F(m)n(x,y;λ;μ,ν). We present the symmetric identities for these polynomials in the following table:

We note that for λ = 1, the symmetry derived above for the 2VTEABP [formula], 2VTEAEP [formula] and 2VTEAGP e(r)Gm)n(x,y;λ) give the corresponding identities for the 2-variable truncated exponential Bernoulli polynomials (2VTEBP) (of order α) e(r)B(α)n(x,y), 2-variable truncated exponential Euler polynomials (2VTEEP) (of order m) e(r)E(m)n(x,y) and 2-variable truncated exponential Genocchi polynomials (2VTEGP) (of order m) e(r)G(m)n(x,y), respectively. Again, for m = 1, we get the corresponding identities for the 2-variable truncated exponential Bernoulli polynomials (2VTEBP) e(r)Bn(x,y), 2-variable truncated exponential Euler polynomials (2VTEEP) e(r)En(x,y) and 2-variable truncated exponential Genocchi polynomials (2VTEGP) e(r)Gn(x,y).
