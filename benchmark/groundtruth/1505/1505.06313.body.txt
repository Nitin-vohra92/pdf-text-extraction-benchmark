Tropical Multiplier Sequences

Results

Consider the polynomial ring [formula] consisting of all real univariate polynomials. Let γ  =  {γn}∞n = 0 be a sequence of real numbers, to which we associate the diagonal operator [formula] defined by zn  ↦  γnzn, for [formula], and extended to [formula] by linearity. The sequence γ is said to be a multiplier sequence if Tγ preserves the set of real-rooted polynomials, see [\cite=CC04] for background information and applications.

We borrow the following notation from Wiman-Valiron theory, see, e.g., [\cite=Hay74]. A non-negative integer m is said to be a central index of the polynomial

[formula]

if there exists a number zm  ≥  0 such that

[formula]

Condition [\eqref=eqn:Lopsidedness] has recently appeared in the context of amoebas, see, e.g., [\cite=Rul03]. To relate [\eqref=eqn:Lopsidedness] to real-rootedness, we recall that a real polynomial is said to be sign-independently real-rooted if any polynomial obtained by arbitrary sign changess of its coefficients is real-rooted, see [\cite=PRS11].

A real polynomial f of degree d is sign-independently real-rooted if and only if each index [formula] is a central index of f.

In this article, we discuss sequences γ that preserve the set of central indices. In addition, we introduce the following notion. A non-negative integer m is said to be a tropical index of f if there exists a number zm  ≥  0 such that

[formula]

Notice that [\eqref=eqn:Tropical] is the analogue of [\eqref=eqn:Lopsidedness] when the right hand side of [\eqref=eqn:Lopsidedness] is interpreted as a tropical sum. A polynomial f of degree d is said to be tropically real-rooted if and only if each index [formula] is a tropical index of f.

As the definition of central and tropical indices only depend on the moduli |an|, they are immediately extended to complex polynomials. However, for simplicity, we will henceforth assume that an  ≥  0 for all n, and we will consider only positive sequences γ. Such a sequence is said to be log-concave if γ2n  ≥  γn - 1γn + 1 for all n. In [\cite=PRS11] it was proven, using discriminant amoebas, that the diagonal operator Tγ associated to the sequence γ preserves the set of sign-independently real-rooted polynomials if and only if γ is log-concave. For this reason, log-concave sequences are said to be multiplier sequences of the third kind (we will say that γ is a tropical multiplier sequence).

A sequence γ is said to be a tropical (resp. central) index preserver if for each polynomial f the set of tropical (resp. central) indices of f is a subset of the set of tropical (resp. central) indices of Tγ[f].

Our main results are as follows.

A positive sequence γ is a tropical index preserver if and only if it is log-concave.

A positive sequence γ is a central index preserver if and only if it is log-concave.

As a corollary, we obtain an elementary proof of [\cite=PRS11] as requested in [\cite=PRS11].

A positive sequence γ preserves the set of sign-independently real-rooted polynomials if and only if it is log-concave.

Finally, let us state our main lemma.

A positive sequence γ is log-concave if and only if for each d the polynomial

[formula]

is tropically real-rooted.

Using Lemma [\ref=lem:LogConcaveTropical], we could rephrase Theorems [\ref=thm:TropicalIndexPreserver] and [\ref=thm:CentralIndexPreserver] in a manner similar to the classical result of Pólya and Schur [\cite=PS14]. Namely, a positive sequence γ is a central and tropical index preserver if and only if the tropical symbol Pγ(z) is tropically real-rooted.

Proofs

Assume first that γ is log-concave. For each m  ≥  1 define zm by [formula]. Then,

[formula]

so that {zm}∞m = 1 is a non-decreasing sequence of positive real numbers. Further more,

[formula]

Since both binomials γnzn  -  γn + 1zn + 1 and γnzn  -  γn - 1zn - 1 have exactly one positive real root, we conclude that γnznm  ≥  γn + 1zn + 1m if n  ≥  m and that γnznm  ≥  γn - 1zn - 1m if n  ≤  m. Hence,

[formula]

For the converse, assume that γ is not log-concave. That is, there exists an index m for which γ2m  <  γm - 1γm + 1. Then, for z  ≥  0,

[formula]

In particular, m is not a tropical index of Pγ(z).

Assume first that γ is log-concave. Let m be a tropical index of f, and let zm  ≥  0 be such that

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem:LogConcaveTropical] we can find a ζm such that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

for all n. Hence, m is a tropical index of Tγ[f].

For the converse, it suffices to consider the polynomials [formula], which is tropically real-rooted for all d, and use Lemma [\ref=lem:LogConcaveTropical].

Assume first that γ is log-concave, and let ζm be as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:TropicalIndexPreserver]. Let m be a central index of f, and let zm be such that

[formula]

Then,

[formula]

implying that m is a central index of Tγ[f].

For the converse, assume that γ2m  <  γm - 1γm + 1, and consider the action of Tγ on the trinomial zm - 1  +  2zm  +  zm + 1.

To prove the only if-part, it suffices to choose zm as the mean of the two positive roots of the polynomial

[formula]

which exists by assumption. For the if-part, choose arbitrary signs of the coefficients of f. We note that the criterion [\eqref=eqn:Lopsidedness] implies that

[formula]

for z > 0. Using additionally Descartes' rule of signs, we conclude that the number of positive roots of f is equal to the number of sign changes in the sequence {an}dn = 0. Similarly, the number of negative roots of f is equal to the number of sign changes in the sequence {an( - 1)n}dn = 0. As an  ≠  0 for each n, these two numbers sums up to d, implying that f(z) is real-rooted. Since the signs of the coefficients were chosen arbitrary, we are done.

It follows from Proposition [\ref=pro:SignIndependently] that a positive sequence preserves the set of sign-independently real-rooted polynomials if and only if it preserves central indices, and it follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:CentralIndexPreserver] that a positive sequence preserves central indices if and only if it is log-concave.
