Counterexamples Related to Rotations of Shadows of Convex Bodies

2010 Mathematics Subject Classification: Primary: 52A20, 52A38, 44A12.

Introduction

Let K be a convex body in [formula]. Given a unit vector ξ∈Sn - 1, we will denote by [formula] the orthogonal projection of K on the hyperplane [formula]. Let SO(n) be the group of rotations in [formula], and [formula] be the group of rotations on the hyperplane [formula]. In this paper we study the following problem.

Let K, L, be convex bodies in [formula]. Suppose that for every ξ∈Sn - 1, the orthogonal projection [formula] can be rotated around the origin to fit inside [formula], i.e. there exists a rotation [formula] such that [formula].

(a) Does it follow that L contains a rotation of K, i.e., is there a ψ∈SO(n) such that ψ(K)  ⊆  L?

(b) Does it follow that voln(K)  ≤  voln(L)?

In [\cite=K1], D. Klain studied the same questions with translations instead of rotations. He proved that the answer to question [\ref=prob2](a) for translations is negative in general, in any dimension. A counterexample is obtained by considering a ball B, together with the dilated simplex (1 + ε)T, where T is the simplex inscribed in B. Then, for any ε > 0, the dilated simplex (1 + ε)T is not contained in the ball nor can be translated to fit inside, but if ε is small enough, all the projections of (1 + ε)T on hyperplanes can be translated to fit inside the corresponding projections of the ball. Klain also proved that if both bodies are centrally symmetric, the answer to Problem [\ref=prob2](a) for translations is affirmative.

Regarding question [\ref=prob2](b) for translations, Klain showed that the answer is negative, in general, but that there exists a class of bodies such that the answer to [\ref=prob2](b) for translations is affirmative if L belongs to that class.

Problem 1 and the analogous problem for translations are both related to the well-known Shephard's Problem (see [\cite=Sh]).

Shephard's Problem: Let K,L be origin symmetric convex bodies. If for every ξ∈Sn - 1, we have [formula], does it follow that voln(K)  ≤  voln(L)?

It was proven independently by Petty [\cite=P] and Schneider [\cite=Sc1] that the answer to Shephard's Problem is negative in general in dimension n  ≥  3. In other words, a body K may have greater volume than another body L, even if all projections of K have smaller (n - 1)-dimensional volume than the corresponding projections of L. In fact, K may be taken to be a ball, while L is a centrally symmetric double cone (see [\cite=Ga]). Petty and Schneider also proved that the answer is affirmative under the additional assumption that the body L is a projection body (see [\cite=Ga]).

Observe that if K and L are two convex bodies for which the answer to Problem [\ref=prob2](a) is affirmative for either rotations or translations, then Shephard's problem for K and L also has an affirmative answer.

It is natural to consider the analogous question to Problem [\ref=prob2], replacing projections by sections. Here, [formula] denotes the section of K by the hyperplane [formula].

Let K, L, be convex bodies in [formula]. Suppose that for every ξ∈Sn - 1, the section [formula] can be rotated around the origin to fit inside [formula].

(a) Does L contain a rotation of K?

(b) Does it follow that voln(K)  ≤  voln(L)?

In the case of Problem [\ref=prob3] for translations, it is known that if K and L are bodies containing the origin in their interior, such that [formula] is a translate of [formula] for every ξ∈Sn - 1, then K is a translate of L (see [\cite=Ga]).

We note that Klain's and Shephard's counterexamples will not work for our Problems [\ref=prob2] and [\ref=prob3], since in both cases, one of the bodies they consider is a ball, which is invariant under rotations, as are all of its projections and sections. In Section [\ref=3d], we present counterexamples for Problem [\ref=prob2](a) and Problem [\ref=prob3](a). The first counterexample is in [formula], and consists of a cylinder C and a double cone K. We note that both the cylinder and double cone are centrally symmetric bodies, and hence, unlike the case of translations proved by Klain, our Problem [\ref=prob2](a) does not have an affirmative answer for centrally symmetric bodies. The second example, which works in general dimension n, is given by appropriately chosen perturbations of two balls, following ideas of Kuzminykh and Nazarov. However, none of our counterexamples provide an affirmative answer to Problems [\ref=prob2](b) or [\ref=prob3](b).

In Section [\ref=vols], we obtain a positive answer for Problem [\ref=prob2](a), in [formula], assuming a Hadwiger type additional condition on the bodies K and L (see [\cite=Ha]). We also prove that the answer to Problem [\ref=prob3](b) is affirmative (Theorem [\ref=MM]). However, for the case of projections, the argument only allows us to conclude the relation voln(K*)  ≥  voln(L*) for the polar bodies, while Problem [\ref=prob2](b) remains open.

In Section [\ref=cong], we study the case in which the projections of K are equal, up to a rotation, to the corresponding projections of L. We prove that if K and L are bodies in [formula] with countably many diameters, and that their hyperplane projections do not have certain rotational symmetries, then K =   ±  L. For n  ≥  4, an n-dimensional version of this result has been obtained by the authors and D. Ryabogin in [\cite=ACR], following ideas of Golubyatnikov [\cite=Go] and Ryabogin [\cite=Rubik].

Notation

In this section we introduce the notation that will be used throughout the paper.

The unit sphere in [formula] (n  ≥  2), is Sn - 1. The notation SO(n) for the group of rotations in [formula], and SO(k), 2  ≤  k  ≤  n for their subgroups is standard. If U∈SO(n) is an orthogonal matrix, we will write Ut for its transpose.

We will write [formula], meaning that there exists a choice of an orthonormal basis in [formula] and a rotation Φ∈SO(n), with a matrix written in this basis, such that the action of Φ on [formula] is the rotation φξ in [formula], and the action of Φ in the ξ direction is trivial, i.e., Φ(ξ) = ξ.

We refer to [\cite=Ga] for the next definitions. A body in [formula] is a compact set which is equal to the closure of its non-empty interior. A convex body is a body K such that for every pair of points in K, the segment joining them is contained in K. For [formula], the support function of a convex body K is defined as hK(x) =  max {x  ·  y:    y∈K} (see page 16 in [\cite=Ga]). The support function uniquely determines a convex body, and hK1  ≤  hK2 if and only if K1  ⊆  K2.

The width function ωK(x) of K in the direction x∈Sn - 1 is defined as ωK(x) = hK(x) + hK( - x). The segment ⊂  K is called the diameter of the body K if [formula]. Note that a convex body K can have at most one diameter parallel to a given direction, for if K has two parallel diameters d1 and d2, then K contains a parallelogram with sides d1 and d2, and one of the diagonals of this parallelogram is longer than d1. If a diameter of K is parallel to the direction ζ∈Sn - 1, we will denote it by dK(ζ). We say that a convex body [formula] has countably many diameters if the width function ωK reaches its maximum on a countable subset of Sn - 1. Also, a body has constant width if its width function is constant.

A set [formula] is said to be star-shaped at a point p if the line segment from p to any point in E is contained in E. Let [formula], and let [formula] be a star-shaped set at the origin. The radial function ρK is defined as ρK(x) =  max {c:  cx∈K}, (here the line through x and the origin is assumed to meet K, [\cite=Ga]). We say that a body K is a star body if it K is star-shaped at the origin and its radial function ρK is continuous. The radial function uniquely determines a star body, and ρK1  ≤  ρK2 if and only if K1  ⊆  K2.

For a subset E of [formula], the polar set of E is defined as E*  =  {x:x  ·  y  ≤  1y∈E} (see [\cite=Ga]). When K is a convex body containing the origin, the same is true of K* (which is called the polar body of K), and we have the following relation between the support function of K and the radial function of K*: For every u∈Sn - 1,

[formula]

For any linear transformation φ∈GL(n), we have

[formula]

A similar relation

[formula]

holds for the radial function. Combining ([\ref=radsup]), ([\ref=rots]) and ([\ref=rotsrho]), it follows that h(φK)*(u) = hφ- tK*(u) (see [\cite=Ga]); this gives us the identity (φK)*  =  φ- tK* for the polar of a linear transformation of the body K.

If S is a subspace of [formula], hK|S(u) = hK(u) and [formula], for every [formula]. Combining these facts with ([\ref=radsup]), we obtain the polarity relation between sections and projections,

[formula]

Counterexamples for Problems [\ref=prob2](a) and [\ref=prob3](a)

Counterexample in [formula].

Our first counterexample is three-dimensional, and it is provided by two centrally symmetric convex bodies, a cylinder C and a double cone K. We show that all sections of C can be rotated to fit into the corresponding sections of K, and that C cannot be rotated to fit inside K. Due to the relations ([\ref=rots]), ([\ref=rotsrho]), and polarity ([\ref=secproj]), this will imply that all projections of K* fit into the corresponding projections of C* after a rotation, while no rotation of K* is included in C*. Thus, our two bodies provide at the same time counterexamples for [\ref=prob2](a) and [\ref=prob3](a).

Let [formula] be the cylinder around the z-axis, centered at the origin, with radius r and height 2r, where [formula] Let K be the double cone obtained by rotating the triangle with vertices [formula] and (1,0,0) around the z-axis. Since r > 1 / 2, the cylinder C is not contained in the double cone K; in fact, the condition r > 1 / 2 is enough to guarantee that no rotation of C is contained in K (the proof of this fact is given in the Appendix, Lemma [\ref=no3Drot]).

Observe that the polar body of C is the double cone obtained by rotating the triangle with vertices (0,0,  ±  1 / r) and (1 / r,0,0) around the z-axis. The polar body of K is a cylinder with radius 1 and height 2. Hence, the dilation of C* by a factor r is equal to K, and similarly the dilation of K* by r is equal to C. By proving that all sections of C can be rotated to fit into the sections of K, we are in fact proving that all projections of C are included in the corresponding projections of K after a rotation. Here we present a sketch of the argument, with the detailed calculations shown in the Appendix.

Since C and K are centrally symmetric bodies of revolution, it is enough to study their sections by planes perpendicular to [formula], where θ∈[0,π  /  2] is the vertical angle from the axis of revolution (see Figure [\ref=xsection]). As seen in the Appendix, the radial function of the section of the double cone K by [formula] is

[formula]

When θ∈[0,π  /  4], the section of the cylinder by [formula] is an ellipse with semiaxes of length r sec θ and r. Its radial function is

[formula]

On the other hand, when θ∈(π / 4,π / 2], the section of the cylinder looks like an ellipse with semiaxes of length r sec θ (along the x-axis) and r (along the y-axis), that has been truncated by two vertical lines at x =   ±  r csc (θ). Its radial function is

[formula]

where [formula].

Let [formula]. For θ∈[null], the section [formula] is contained in [formula] and there is nothing to prove (see Figure [\ref=xsection]). For θ∈(θ0,π / 4], [formula] is not a subset of [formula]. However, a rotation by π / 2 of the section of the cylinder is contained in the section of the double cone. Indeed, from equation ([\ref=radialcyl1]) we easily see that the rotation by π / 2 of the section of the cylinder has radial function

[formula]

We have that [formula], for every u∈[0,π  /  2], θ∈(θ0,π / 4]. The crucial observation is that for fixed u, [formula] is an increasing function of θ∈[0,π  /  4], while [formula] is decreasing. It is enough, therefore, to show that [formula] for u∈[0,π  /  2]. Figure [\ref=rot90] shows this situation for r = 0.51.

When θ∈(π / 4,π / 2], the section [formula] is never contained in [formula], but if [formula], there exist angles θ1,θ2∈(π / 4,π / 2), with θ2  ≤  θ1, such that for θ∈(π / 4,θ1] a rotation by π / 2 of the section of the cylinder is contained in the section of the double cone, and for θ∈[null] a rotation by the angle u0 of the section of the cylinder is contained in the section of the double cone. The idea is that when θ  =  π / 4, the π / 2 rotation of the section [formula] is strictly contained within [formula], which implies the same, by continuity, for θ in some interval (π / 4,θ1]; on the other hand, when θ  =  π / 2 and both sections are squares, a rotation by π / 4 = u0(π / 2) of [formula] is strictly included in [formula], and by continuity the same is true on some interval

[formula]

Counterexample in [formula]

Given the unit sphere in [formula], we will perturb it by adding bump functions to create two convex bodies K and L. We place the bumps on K so that they form a simplex on the surface of K, but no such simplex configuration of bumps will appear on the surface on L, thus impeding that K may be rotated to fit inside of L. On the other hand, every hyperplane section of K will be contained in the corresponding section of L after a rotation. We thus obtain a counterexample for [\ref=prob3](a). By polarity, the bodies L* and K* provide a counterexample for Problem [\ref=prob2](a).

Given ξ∈Sn - 1, the great (n - 2)-dimensional subsphere of Sn - 1 that is orthogonal to ξ will be denoted by Sn - 2(ξ) = {θ∈Sn - 1:θ  ·  ξ = 0}. For t∈[ -  1,1], the subsphere that is parallel to Sn - 2(ξ) and is located at height t will be denoted by Sn - 2t(ξ) (see Figure [\ref=parallels]).

The radial function of the unit sphere is the constant function 1. We consider a smooth bump function φξ,δ defined on Sn - 1, supported in a small disk Dξ on the surface of Sn - 1 with center at ξ∈Sn - 1 and with radius δ. The function φξ,δ is invariant under rotations that fix the direction ξ, and its maximum height at the point ξ is 1. For u∈Sn - 1, the body whose radial function is 1 + ε  φξ,δ(u) is convex, since its curvature will be positive provided that ε is small enough (see, for example, [\cite=GRYZ]).

The first body K is defined to be the unit sphere with n bumps placed on the surface, so that their centers ξj, [formula] form a regular spherical simplex. We assume that the vertex ξ1 is the north pole, and that [formula] is the spherical distance between the vertices of the simplex. The radial function of K is

[formula]

i.e., each bump is supported on a disk with center ξj and radius δ (to be chosen later), and has height [formula], where ε is small enough so that K will be convex. Given any two vertices of the simplex ξi and ξj, with i  ≠  j, consider the lune formed by the union of all (n - 2)-dimensional great spheres passing through any two points x∈Dξi and y∈Dξj. Let a be the maximum width of the lune. If we choose δ  =  v4, it follows that a  ≈  v3 (see Figure [\ref=lune]).

We define L to be the unit sphere with bumps placed on the surface in the following way. On every point ξj  ≠  ξ1, (i.e., not on the north pole), we place a bump function of height [formula] and radius δ. Notice that these are the values of the height and radius of the bumps on K. Thus, by construction, any section of K that does not pass through the bump at the north pole, is automatically contained in the corresponding section of L.

We now consider a section of K that passes through the bump at the north pole. We will need to place bumps on L in such a way that the section of K can be rotated to be included in the corresponding section of L. For this purpose, we split the top half of the sphere into 2n layers. For [formula], the k-th layer Lk is the spherical ring placed between the parallels Sn - 2tk - 1(ξ1) and Sn - 2tk(ξ1), where [formula]. The top layer is the spherical cap centered at the north pole, and above the parallel Sn - 2t2n - 1(ξ1). Observe that the (n - 1) bumps we have already placed are all on the top layer, since δ < v and [formula], while the spherical radius of the top layer is [formula]. For every odd k, the layer Lk will remain empty of bumps. For each 2  ≤  j  ≤  n - 1, and for each configuration of j vertices of the simplex in K, one of which is the north pole, we place on a layer Lk with k even an identical configuration of vertices (i.e. a rotation of the original configuration into Lk, see Figure [\ref=bumps]). On each vertex x we place the bump function [formula], where [formula]. The definition of v guarantees that the layers are wide enough to contain each configuration of bumps, and also that the larger bumps do not overlap, since [formula].

Since [formula], every section of K that intersects j of the bumps will be contained after a rotation in the corresponding section of L. On the other hand, since [formula], no layer can contain n bumps of smaller height ε / 103 placed in the shape of the original simplex on K.

Finally, we define a function ψξ1 as the function obtained by sliding [formula] around the equator Sn - 2(ξ1) of L. This guarantees that every section of K that passes through the north pole and no other bump on K can be rotated by the angle π / 2 into the corresponding section of L. This concludes the n-dimensional counterexample.

Sections, projections, and volumes

The counterexamples to Problem [\ref=prob2](a) presented in Section [\ref=3d] do not provide a negative answer to Problem [\ref=prob2](b), as in both cases the body with the larger projections also has the larger volume. In fact, Theorem [\ref=MM1] below shows that our assumptions on the projections of K and L only imply that the volume of the polar body K* is larger than the volume of L*, but gives us no relation between the volumes of K and L. On the other hand, the answer to Problem [\ref=prob3](b) is affirmative: One can obtain the desired relation voln(K)  ≤  voln(L) if the sections of K are assumed to fit into the corresponding sections of L after rotation. This is proved in the following Theorem.

Let K and L be two star bodies in [formula], n  ≥  2, such that for every ξ∈Sn - 1, there exists a rotation [formula] such that

[formula]

Then,

[formula]

By hypothesis, for every ξ∈Sn - 1 there exists a rotation [formula] such that

[formula]

By ([\ref=rotsrho]), this is equivalent to

[formula]

Raising to the power n, integrating, and using the rotation invariance of the Lebesgue measure, we obtain

[formula]

Averaging over the unit sphere, we have

[formula]

Finally, using Fubini's Theorem and the formula for the volume in terms of the radial function (see [\cite=K])

[formula]

we obtain the result.

For the next theorem we use the standard notation int(K) for the interior of K. The proof is similar to that of Theorem [\ref=MM].

Let K and L be two convex bodies in [formula], n  ≥  2, such that [formula], and for every ξ∈Sn - 1, there exists a rotation [formula] such that

[formula]

Then,

[formula]

By hypothesis, for every ξ∈Sn - 1 there exists a rotation [formula] such that

[formula]

By ([\ref=radsup]) and ([\ref=rots]), this is equivalent to

[formula]

Raising to the power n, integrating, and using the rotation invariance of the Lebesgue measure, we obtain

[formula]

Averaging over the unit sphere we have

[formula]

Finally, using Fubini's Theorem and ([\ref=vol]), we obtain the desired result.

In order to obtain a positive answer to Problem [\ref=prob2](b), we need to impose additional conditions on the bodies K and L. We do this in Theorem [\ref=countable], following ideas of Hadwiger [\cite=Ha], by assuming the existence of a diameter dK(ξ0) of K in the direction ξ0, such that the hypotheses of Problem [\ref=prob2] hold on every plane that contains that diameter. For [formula], we will call [formula] (resp. [formula]) a side projection of K (resp. of L). See Figure [\ref=egg].

Let K,L be convex bodies in [formula] such that each of K,L have countably many diameters of the same length, i.e., [formula], and, for each body, the maximum is attained at a countable set of directions. Assume that there exists a diameter dK(ξ0), such that for every [formula], there exists [formula] such that [formula], i.e., every side projection of K is contained, after a rotation, in the corresponding side projection of L. If either K or L is origin-symmetric then K  ⊆  L.

First we show that L must have a diameter in the direction ξ0. If this is not the case, then there exists a plane H that contains ξ0 and none of the directions of the diameters of L. Then K|H contains a diameter of K (namely dK(ξ0)) and L|H does not contain a diameter of L, hence K|H can never be rotated into L|H. This contradiction shows that L has a diameter dL(ξ0).

Let D be the countable set of all directions of the diameters of K and L, excluding ξ0. For [formula], let [formula] be a plane containing no direction in D (clearly, [formula] contains ξ0). Since [formula], and φw is a rotation around the origin that takes the diameter dK(ξ0) onto the parallel diameter dL(ξ0), it follows that either φw is the identity, or that both dK(ξ0) and dL(ξ0) are centered at the origin and φw is a rotation by π. In the first case, we have [formula]. In the second case, we have [formula]. But either K or L is origin-symmetric, and hence we obtain [formula] also in this case. Thus, for every θ∈S2 such that [formula] and [formula] does not contain any direction in D, we have that hK(θ)  ≤  hL(θ).

Let Hi be the plane that contains ξ0 and ξi∈D, and assume that [formula]. Since there are only countably many such Hi's, we can choose a sequence {θj} of points in S2, converging to θ, such that none of the θj are contained in [formula]. Hence, hK(θj)  ≤  hL(θj), and by the continuity of the support function, hK(θ)  ≤  hL(θ). We have thus proven that K  ⊆  L.

A more general version of Theorem [\ref=countable] can be proven: With the same hypotheses for the diameters of K,L, if every projection [formula] can be rotated and translated to be included in [formula], and either K or L is centrally symmetric, then K is contained in a translate of L (the argument is similar to that in the proof of [\cite=ACR]).

We finish this section with two related results.

Let K,L be two convex bodies in [formula], such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then K  ⊆    ±  L.

Assume that [formula] is strictly contained in [formula]. By continuity, there is a open set of directions in S2 where the containment is strict. Integrating, we obtain [formula], contradicting our hypothesis. Therefore, for every ξ∈S2 there exists a rotation [formula] such that [formula]. By [\cite=Rubik], we conclude that K =   ±  L.

Let K,L be two convex bodies of equal constant width in [formula], such that

[formula]

Then vol3(K)  ≤  vol3(L).

The assumption on the projections implies that the surface area of K is less than or equal to the surface area of L. Indeed, Cauchy's surface area formula [\cite=Ga] says that the surface area of the body K is equal to

[formula]

where B is the unit Euclidean ball in [formula]. Since every projection of K is contained in the corresponding projection of L after a rotation, we have [formula], and Cauchy's formula gives us S(K)  ≤  S(L).

On the other hand, for bodies of constant width w in [formula], there is a known formula relating volume, surface area and width (see [\cite=CG]):

[formula]

Using this relation, we conclude that vol3(K)  ≤  vol3(L).

Directly Congruent Projections

In the previous sections, we have studied the problem in which the projections of K can be rotated to be contained into the corresponding projections of L. In this section, we will assume that the projections of K are directly congruent to the corresponding projections of L (i.e. they coincide up to a rotation and a translation). The main argument of the proof follows ideas from Golubyatnikov [\cite=Go] and Ryabogin [\cite=Rubik]. Some of the arguments we use can be found in full detail in the paper [\cite=ACR].

Let K and L be two convex bodies in [formula] having countably many diameters. Assume that there exists a diameter dK(ξ0), such that the side projections [formula], [formula] onto all subspaces [formula] containing ξ0 are directly congruent. Assume also that these projections are not centrally symmetric. Then K =   ±  L + b for some [formula].

For the same reasons as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=countable], L must have a diameter parallel to the direction ξ0. Denote by [formula] the countable set of directions parallel to the diameters of K and the diameters of L. Let Hi be the plane that contains the directions ξ0 and ξi, and consider the set

[formula]

Because the set {Hi} is countable, Λ is everywhere dense in S1(ξ0). (In fact, the hypothesis that K and L have countably many diameters can be replaced by the weaker hypothesis that Λ is everywhere dense.)

Next, we translate K and L so that their diameters dK(ξ0) and dL(ξ0) coincide and are centered at the origin. We name the translated bodies [formula] and [formula]. It is easy to show that the side projections [formula] and [formula] coincide up to a rotation (see [\cite=ACR]).

Denote by H'w the plane that contains w and ξ0. Since for all w∈Λ, the only diameter of |H'w is [formula], the direct rigid motion given by the statement of the theorem must fix this diameter, and hence it is either the identity or a rotation about the origin by π. In the first case, |H'w  =  |H'w and in the second, |H'w =  - |H'w. Define

[formula]

and

[formula]

By a standard argument, it is easy to prove that Ξ and Ψ are closed (see Lemma 3 in [\cite=ACR]). From the definitions of Ξ and Ψ we have that [formula], and since [formula] is closed and Λ is everywhere dense we have [formula].

Next we claim that [formula]. Indeed, assume this is not the case and let [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

which implies that |H'w (and hence L|H'w) is centrally symmetric. This contradicts our assumption, and thus [formula].

Therefore, either Ξ = S1(ξ0) or Ψ = S1(ξ0). If Ξ = S1(ξ0), then for every θ∈S2 there exists a plane H'w for some w∈S1(ξ0), such that θ∈H'w. Hence,

[formula]

where the second equality follows from the definition of Ξ. It follows that   =  .

If Ψ = S1(ξ0), again for every θ∈S2, we have that θ∈H'w for some w∈S1(ξ0). Note that we also have -  θ∈H'w. Hence,

[formula]

where the second equality follows from the definition of Ψ. We conclude that  =  - , and the Theorem is proved.

The sections of the cylinder and the double cone in [formula]

Here we provide the detailed calculations for the example in Section [\ref=3d] for the convenience of the reader.

Determining the radial function of the boundary curves of the sections of K and C.

The upper half of the double cone has equation [formula], and the plane [formula] has equation z =  tan (θ)x. The curve of intersection in parametric equations is given by

[formula]

where z =  tan (θ)(1 - z) cos (t) (from the equation of the plane). Solving for z in this last equation, we obtain [formula], and therefore

[formula]

This curve is still expressed as a subset of [formula], so now we will write it as a two dimensional curve on the plane [formula]. The vectors 〈1,0,0〉 and 〈0,1,0〉 project onto [formula] and [formula] on the plane z =  tan (θ)x. Therefore, for t∈[0,π  /  2], the parametric curve written in this basis becomes

[formula]

Finally, it will be more convenient to express it in polar coordinates. Setting [formula] and solving, we obtain that the radial function of the section [formula] is

[formula]

for u∈[0,π  /  2]. The function is extended evenly to

[formula]

, with minimum value [formula], and maximum value [formula]. Also, for fixed u∈[0,π  /  2], [formula] is a decreasing function of θ∈[0,π  /  4]. In contrast, when θ∈(π / 4,π / 2], [formula] has a local maximum at u = 0 and a local (and absolute) minimum at [formula], with value [formula]. Its absolute maximum is [formula].

Similarly, we calculate the radial function of [formula]. The intersection of the cylinder with the plane z =  tan (θ)x, for θ∈[0,π  /  4], is an ellipse with parametrization

[formula]

In terms of the basis [formula], the parametrization is given by

[formula]

and the radial function is

[formula]

and evenly extended on

[formula]
