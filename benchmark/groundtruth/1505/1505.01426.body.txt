Introduction

We denote by Πq a projective plane (not necessary Desarguesian) of order q and by PG(2,q) the projective plane over the Galois field of q elements. For an introduction to projective geometries over finite fields see [\cite=HirsBook].

A point set S  ⊂  Πq is saturating if any point of [formula] is collinear with two points in~ S, see [\cite=DGMP-AMC] [\cite=DMP-JCTA2003] [\cite=Giul2013Survey] [\cite=Ughi] and references therein. It should be noted that saturating sets are also called saturated sets [\cite=Kovacs] [\cite=Ughi], spanning sets [\cite=BrPlWi], and dense sets [\cite=BorSzTic] [\cite=GacsSzonyi] [\cite=Giul-plane].

The points of a saturating set in PG(2,q) form a parity check matrix of a q-ary linear covering code with codimension 3, covering radius 2, and minimum distance 3 or 4. For an introduction to covering codes see [\cite=Handbook-coverings] [\cite=CHLS-bookCovCod]. An online bibliography on covering codes is given in [\cite=LobstBibl].

The main problem in this context is to find small saturating sets (i.e. short covering codes).

Let s(2,q) be the smallest size of a saturating set in Πq.

In [\cite=BorSzTic] using the approach of [\cite=Kovacs] by probabilistic methods the following upper bound is proved:

[formula]

Surveys on random constructions for geometrical objects can be found in [\cite=BorSzTic] [\cite=GacsSzonyi] [\cite=KV] [\cite=Kovacs], see also references therein. Saturating sets in PG(2,q) obtained by algebraic constructions and computer search can be found in [\cite=BFMP-JG2013] [\cite=BrPlWi] [\cite=DavCovRad2] [\cite=DGMP-AMC] [\cite=DMP-JCTA2003] [\cite=Giul-plane] [\cite=Giul2013Survey] [\cite=Ughi].

In this paper, we use probabilistic methods to obtain upper bounds on s(2,q). The main results are given by the following theorems.

For the smallest size s(2,q) of a saturating set in the projective plane (not necessary Desarguesian) of order q the following upper bound holds.

[formula]

Let Then in the projective plane (not necessary Desarguesian) of order q, a random point k-set is a saturating set with probability

[formula]

It is worth noting that, even if the bounds [\eqref=eq1_1sat] and [\eqref=satsetsize] have the same shape, the constant in [\eqref=satsetsize] is slightly smaller than the one in [\eqref=eq1_1sat]. Also, we use a different approach from those in [\cite=BorSzTic] [\cite=Kovacs] where random sets placed on two or three lines are constructed. In this paper we consider arbitrary random sets.

The length function [formula] denotes the smallest length of a q-ary linear code with covering radius 2 and codimension 3; see [\cite=Handbook-coverings] [\cite=BrPlWi] [\cite=CHLS-bookCovCod]. The result of Theorem [\ref=th1] means that

[formula]

Upper bound on the smallest size of a saturating set

Let w be a fixed integer and consider a random (w + 1)-subset Kw + 1 of Πq. The total number of such subsets is [formula] A fixed point A of Πq is covered by Kw + 1 if it belongs to an r-secant of Kw + 1 with r  ≥  2. We denote by [formula] the probability of some event [formula].

We estimate as the ratio of the number of (w + 1)-subsets not covering A to the total number of subsets of size (w + 1). Since a set Kw + 1 does not cover A if and only if every line through A contains at most one point of Kw + 1, we have

By straightforward calculations,

Using the classical inequality 1 - x  ≤  e- x we obtain that which implies

[formula]

provided that that is

The set Kw + 1 is not saturating if at least one point A∈Πq is not covered by Kw + 1. Similarly to [\cite=BorSzTic], we note that

[formula]

Now, using [\eqref=eq_pi_estimate], we obtain that

[formula]

Therefore, the probability that all the points of Πq are covered is

[formula]

This quantity is larger than 0 taking for instance This shows that in Πq there exists a saturating k-set with and therefore Theorem [\ref=th1] is proved.

In conclusion, we note that any with the parameter c  ≥  1 independent of q, is such that [\eqref=eq_A_covered] is positive; therefore Theorem [\ref=th2] holds true.

It is worth noting that in [\eqref=eq_bigprob] for q large enough, choosing c = 1 + ε, with ε = o(1) > 0, the probability p is close to 1.

Let an q2 code be a linear q-ary code of length n, codimension r, and covering radius 2. Columns of a parity check matrix of the code can be treated as points of a saturating n-set in the space PG(r - 1,q) [\cite=BrPlWi] [\cite=CHLS-bookCovCod] [\cite=DavCovRad2] [\cite=DGMP-AMC] [\cite=Giul2013Survey]. Let

[formula]

By above, there exists a saturating nq-set in PG(2,q); hence there is the corresponding q2 code. From this code, using the construction of [\cite=DavCovRad2], see also [\cite=DGMP-AMC], one can obtain an q2 code with [formula] It means that in PG(r - 1,q) there exists a saturating (nqqt - 2 + 2qt - 3)-set. This implies the following upper bound on the smallest size s(N,q) of a saturating set in PG(N,q):

[formula]

Surveys of the known q2 codes and saturating sets in PG(N,q) can be found in [\cite=DGMP-AMC] [\cite=Giul2013Survey]. In a number cases the bound [\eqref=eq_SatSatSpace] is better than the known one.

In [\cite=BDGMP-AMC2015], the concept of multiple saturating sets is introduced. In particular, a point set S  ⊂  PG(2,q) is (1,μ)-saturating if every point Q in PG(2,q) not belonging to S is such that the number of secants of S through Q is at least μ, counted with multiplicity. The multiplicity [formula] of a secant [formula] is computed as [formula] A probabilistic upper bound [formula] on the smallest size of a (1,μ)-saturating set in PG(2,q) is given by [\cite=BDGMP-AMC2015]. If one can found μ disjoint saturating nq-sets in PG(2,q), see [\eqref=eq_nq_rem], then the upper bound is roughly [formula] that is smaller than the known one for [formula].
