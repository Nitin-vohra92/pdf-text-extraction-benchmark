11-colored knot diagram with five colors

Introduction

The n-colorability introduced by Fox [\cite=Fox] is one of the elementary notion in knot theory, and its properties have been studied in many papers. In 1999, Harary and Kauffman [\cite=HK] defined a kind of minimal invariant, Cn(K), of an n-colorable knot K. It is essential to consider the case that n is an odd prime; in fact, for composite n, it is reduced to the cases of odd prime factors of n. In this case, we can define a modified version by restricting "effective" n-colorings (cf. [\cite=IM] [\cite=NNS2]).

Let p be an odd prime. A non-trivial p-coloring C of a knot diagram D is regarded as a non-constant map

[formula]

with a certain condition. For a p-colorable knot K, the number Cp(K) is defined to be the minimum number of #  Im(C) for all non-trivially p-colored diagrams (D,C) of K. This number has been studied in some papers [\cite=CJZ] [\cite=GJKLZ] [\cite=KL] [\cite=KL2] [\cite=LM] [\cite=NNS] [\cite=Osh] [\cite=Sai] [\cite=Sat2]. In particular, it is shown in [\cite=NNS] that

[formula]

for any p-colorable knot K, and the equality holds for p = 3,5,7 [\cite=Osh] [\cite=Sat2].

For p = 11, we have C11(K)  ≥  5 by the above inequality or [\cite=LM]. On the other hand, it is proved in [\cite=CJZ] that C11(K)  ≤  6. If an 11-colored diagram (D,C) satisfies #  Im(C) = 5, then there are two possibilities

[formula]

up to isomorphisms induced by affine maps of [formula]. This split phenomenon is quite different from the cases p = 3,5,7.

Any 11-colorable knot K satisfies the following.

There is an 11-colored diagram (D1,C1) of K with Im(C1) = {1,4,6,7,8}.

There is an 11-colored diagram (D2,C2) of K with Im(C2) = {0,4,6,7,8}.

We remark that these two sets are common 11-minimal sufficient sets of colors but not universal ones in the sense of [\cite=GJKLZ]. By Theorem [\ref=thm11], we have the following immediately.

Any 11-colorable knot K satisfies C11(K) = 5. [formula]

This paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=sec2], we review the palette graph associated with a subset of [formula] and its fundamental properties. In Section [\ref=sec3], we prove Theorem [\ref=thm11](i). The starting point of the proof is a modified version of the theorem in [\cite=CJZ]: For any 11-colorable knot K, there is an 11-colored diagram (D,C) of K with Im(C) = {0,1,4,6,7,8}. By applying Reidemeister moves to (D,C) suitably, we remove the color 0 from the diagram. Sections [\ref=sec4]-[\ref=sec6] are devoted to proving Theorem [\ref=thm11](ii). We first remove the color 1 from (D,C) as above by allowing the birth of new colors 3 and 10 in Section [\ref=sec4], and then remove the colors 10 and 3 in Sections [\ref=sec5] and [\ref=sec6], respectively. In the last section, we prove a similar result for an 11-colorable ribbon 2-knot.

Preliminaries

Throughout this section, p denotes an odd prime.

Let S be a subset of [formula]. The palette graph G(S) of S is a simple graph such that

the vertex set of G(S) is S, and

two vertices a and b∈S are connected by an edge if and only if [formula].

By assigning [formula] to every edge joining a and b, we regard G(S) as a labeled graph. Such an edge is denoted by [formula].

For two subsets S and [formula], the palette graphs G(S) and G(S') are said to be isomorphic if there is a bijection f:S  →  S' such that [formula] if and only if [formula]. We denote it by [formula].

If [formula], then G(S) is a subgraph of G(S'), which is obtained from G(S') by deleting the vertices in [formula] and the edges whose labels belong to [formula].

This follows from definition immediately.

If the palette graph G(S) is connected with #  S > 1, then we have #  S  ≥  ⌊ log 2p⌋ + 2. [formula]

Let S be a subset of [formula] such that G(S) is connected with #  S = ⌊ log 2p⌋ + 2. Put [formula]. Then we have #  U = p(p - 1).

Let T be a maximal tree of G(S). Let [formula] be the vertices of T, and [formula] the edges of T, where k =   #  S = ⌊ log 2p⌋ + 2. Let A = (aij) be the (k - 1)  ×  k matrix with [formula]-entries defined by

[formula]

Let A' be the (k - 1)  ×  (k - 1) matrix obtained from A by deleting the kth column. It is known in [\cite=NNS] that

det(A') is odd,

| det(A')| < 2k - 1, and

det(A') is divisible by p.

Since 2k - 2 < p  ≤  | det(A')| < 2k - 1, we have | det(A')| = p. This implies that the corank of A with [formula]-entries is exactly equal to 2.

Let [formula] denote the solution space. By the above argument, we have

[formula]

Since the elements of U are identified with the vectors of V whose entries are all distinct. Such a vector is obtained by the condition [formula] (mod p). Therefore, we have #  U = p(p - 1).

Let S and S' be subsets of [formula]. Suppose that G(S) and G(S') are connected with #  S =   #  S' = ⌊ log 2p⌋ + 2. Then the following are equivalent.

The palette graphs G(S) and G(S') are isomorphic.

There exist [formula] and [formula] such that the affine map f(x) = αx + β satisfies f(S) = S'.

(ii)⇒  (i). Since [formula] (mod p), f:S  →  S' is a bijection. Furthermore, [formula] holds if and only if [formula] holds.

(i)⇒  (ii). By the above argument, we have

[formula]

where U is the set in Lemma [\ref=lem25]. Since these two sets have the same number of elements by Lemma [\ref=lem25], they are the same set.

Let D be a diagram of a knot K. We regard D as a disjoint union of arcs whose endpoints are under-crossings. Fox [\cite=Fox] introduced the notion of p-colorings: A map [formula] is a p-coloring if [formula] (mod p) holds at every crossing, where a and b are the elements assigned to the under-arcs by C, and c is the one to the over-arc. The triple {a|c|b} is called the color of the crossing. The assigned element of an arc of D is called the color of the arc. If the color of an arc is a, then the arc is called an a-arc.

In a p-colored diagram (D,C), the crossing of color {a|a|a} is called trivial, and otherwise non-trivial. If C is a constant map, it is called a trivial p-coloring, and otherwise, non-trivial. In other words, a p-coloring C is non-trivial if and only if #  Im(C) > 1. If a knot K admits a non-trivially p-colored diagram (D,C), K is called p-colorable.

For a p-colorable knot K, we denote by Cp(K) the minimum number of #  Im(C) for all non-trivially p-colored diagram (D,C) of K [\cite=HK]. For the study of this number, it is helpful to use the palette graph G(Im(C)) of the image [formula] in the following sense.

If {a|c|b} is a non-trivial color of a crossing of a p-colored diagram (D,C), then the palette graph G(Im(C)) has an edge {a|c|b}.

Since [formula] (mod p) holds, the lemma follows by definition.

The palette graph G(Im(C)) of a p-colored diagram (D,C) of a knot is connected.

Let a and b be vertices of G(Im(C)). By definition, we have an a-arc and a b-arc of D. Since D is a diagram of a knot (not a link), we can walk along D from the a-arc to the b-arc. Let {ai|ci|ai + 1} (1  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1) be the colors of non-trivial under-crossings on the path such that a1 = a and ak = b. Then the vertices a and b in the palette graph are connected by a sequence of edges {ai|ci|ai + 1} (1  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1).

Any non-trivial p-colored diagram (D,C) of a knot satisfies #  Im(C)  ≥  ⌊ log 2p⌋ + 2. Therefore, we have Cp(K)  ≥  ⌊ log 2p⌋ + 2 for any p-colorable knot K.

This follows from Theorem [\ref=thm24] and Lemma [\ref=lem28].

Let (D,C) be a non-trivially p-colored diagram of a knot K, and [formula] an affine map defined by f(x) = αx + β with [formula] and [formula]. Then there is a non-trivially p-colored diagram (D,C') of K such that Im(C') = f(Im(C)).

It is easy to see that the composition [formula] is also a non-trivial p-coloring of D.

Now, we consider the case p = 11. By Theorem [\ref=thm24], if the palette graph G(S) of a subset [formula] is connected with #  S > 1, then #  S  ≥  5.

Let S be a subset of [formula]. If the palette graph G(S) is connected with #  S = 5, then G(S) is isomorphic to G({1,4,6,7,8}) or G({0,4,6,7,8}) as shown in Figure [\ref=fig2-01]. [formula]

By Theorem [\ref=thm29] or [\cite=LM], we have C11(K)  ≥  5. The following theorem implies that C11(K) = 5 or 6.

For any 11-colorable knot K, there is a non-trivially 11-colored diagram (D,C) of K with Im(C)  ⊂  {0,1,4,6,7,8}. [formula]

Figure [\ref=fig2-02] shows the palette graph G({0,1,4,6,7,8}). By Lemma [\ref=lem23], the two graphs in Theorem [\ref=thm211] are obtained from this graph by deleting the vertex a and the edges labeled a for a = 0,1, respectively.

It is useful for our argument to modify Theorem [\ref=thm212] slightly as follows.

For any 11-colorable knot K, there is an 11-colored diagram (D,C) of K with Im(C) = {0,1,4,6,7,8}.

We may assume that (D,C) satisfies Theorem [\ref=thm212]; that is, it is a non-trivially 11-colored diagram with Im(C)  ⊂  {0,1,4,6,7,8}. We remark that #  Im(C)  ≥  5 by Theorem [\ref=thm29].

4,6,7∈Im(C). Assume that [formula]. It follows that Im(C) = {0,1,6,7,8}. The palette graph G(Im(C)) is as shown in the left of Figure [\ref=fig2-03] by Lemma [\ref=lem23], which contradicts to the connectivity in Lemma [\ref=lem28]. We can also prove 6,7∈Im(C) by a similar argument. See the center and right of the figure.

0∈Im(C). Assume that [formula]. It follows that Im(C) = {1,4,6,7,8} and its palette graph is as shown in the left of Figure [\ref=fig2-01]. Then we see that (D,C) has a crossing of color {6|1|7} or {1|8|4}. In fact, if we delete the corresponding edges both, the resulting graph becomes disconnected. By deforming the diagram near these crossings as shown in Figure [\ref=fig2-04], we can produce a 0-arc. We replace the original diagram with the new one as (D,C).

1∈Im(C). Assume that [formula]. Then we have Im(C) = {0,4,6,7,8} and its palette graph is as shown the right of Figure [\ref=fig2-01]. Since (D,C) must have a crossing of color {0|4|8} by a similar reason to the above case, we deform the diagram near the crossing to make a 1-arc. See Figure [\ref=fig2-05].

8∈Im(C). Assume that [formula]. Then we have Im(C) = {0,1,4,6,7} and its palette graph is as shown in the left of Figure [\ref=fig2-06]. We remark that the map [formula] defined by f(x) = 7x + 6 induces the isomorphism between G({0,4,6,7,8}) and G({0,1,4,6,7}). The existence of such a map is guaranteed by Theorem [\ref=thm26]. Since (D,C) has a crossing of color {4|0|7}, we deform the diagram near the crossing as shown in the right of the figure so that we obtain an 8-arc.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm11]

For any 11-colorable knot K, there is an 11-colored diagram (D,C) of K such that

Im(C) = {0,1,4,6,7,8}, and

there is no crossing of color { * |0| * }.

We may assume that (D,C) satisfies Lemma [\ref=lem213]. There are two types of crossings of (D,C) whose over-arc is a 0-arc; that is, {0|0|0} and {4|0|7}. In fact, in the palette graph G({0,1,4,6,7,8}), the only edge labeled 0 connects 4 and 7.

First, we assume that (D,C) has crossings of color {4|0|7}. By deforming the diagram near the crossings as shown in Figure [\ref=fig3-01], we can eliminate all the crossings of color {4|0|7}. We remark that the set of colors which are appeared in the diagram does not change.

Next, we assume that (D,C) has a crossing of color {0|0|0}, say x. Walking along the diagram from x, let y be the non-trivial crossing which we meet first. If there are crossings of color {0|0|0} between x and y, we replace the original x with the nearest one to y. Therefore, we may assume that there is no crossing between x and y.

There are two cases with respect to the color of y. In fact, in the palette graph G({0,1,4,6,7,8}), there are two edges incident to the vertex 0, which implies that the color of y is {0|6|1} or {0|4|8}. In each case, we deform the diagram (D,C) near x and y as shown in Figure [\ref=fig3-02], so that the number of crossings of {0|0|0} is decreased. By repeating this process, we obtain a diagram with no crossing of {0|0|0} finally.

We may assume that (D,C) satisfies Lemma [\ref=lem31]. If there is a 0-arc, it is not an over-arc of any crossing, and its endpoints are the under-crossings of color {0|4|8} or {0|6|1}. In fact, there are two edges incident to the vertex 0 in G({1,4,6,7,8}). We have three cases with respect to the colors of the crossings of the endpoints of a 0-arc;

{0|4|8} and {0|6|1},

{0|4|8} both, and

{0|6|1} both.

For the case (i), we deform the 6-arc over the crossing of {0|4|8} to eliminate the 0-arc. See the top of Figure [\ref=fig3-03]. For the case (ii), we deform one of the crossings of color {0|4|8} as shown in the figure so that we reduce this case to (i). Similarly, for the case (iii), we deform one of the crossings of color {0|6|1} as shown in the figure so that we reduce this case to (i). See the bottom of the figure.

For any 11-colorable knot K and [formula], there is an 11-colored diagram (D,C) of K with

[formula]

Let [formula] be the affine map defined by f(x) = 4(b - a)(x - 1) + a. Since the map f satisfies

[formula]

we have the conclusion by Lemma [\ref=lem210] and Theorem [\ref=thm11](i).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm11]-Part I

For any 11-colorable knot K, there is an 11-colored diagram (D,C) of K such that

Im(C) = {0,1,4,6,7,8}, and

there is no crossing of color {6|6|6}.

We may assume that (D,C) satisfies Lemma [\ref=lem213]. Assume that (D,C) has a crossing of color {6|6|6}, say x. Walking along the diagram from x, let y be the first non-trivial under-crossing. If there are crossings of color {6|6|6} between x and y, then we replace the original x with the nearest one to y. Then we have the following:

There is no crossing of {6|6|6} between x and y by assumption.

Every crossing between x and y is of color {0|6|1} or {4|6|8}; for there are exactly two edges labeled 6 in the palette graph G({0,1,4,6,7,8}).

The color of y is {6|1|7} or {6|7|8}; for there are exactly two edges incident to the vertex 6 in the palette graph, which are labeled 1 and 7, respectively.

Assume that there are crossings between x and y. Let z be the nearest crossing to x among them. We deform the diagram near x and z as shown in the upper row of Figure [\ref=fig4-01], so that the number of crossings between x and y is decreased. By repeating this process, we may assume that there is no crossing between x and y. Then we deform the diagram near x and y as shown in the lower row of the figure to eliminate the color {6|6|6}. By repeating this process, we obtain a diagram with no crossing of {6|6|6} finally.

For any 11-colorable knot K, there is an 11-colored diagram (D,C) of K such that

Im(C) = {0,1,4,6,7,8}, and

there is no crossing of color {1|1|1} or {6|6|6}.

We may assume that (D,C) satisfies Lemma [\ref=lem41]. Assume that (D,C) has a crossing of color {1|1|1}, say x. Walking along the diagram from x, let y be the first non-trivial crossing. If there are crossing of {1|1|1} between x and y, then we replace the original x with the nearest one to y.

In the palette graph G({0,1,4,6,7,8}), there are exactly three edges incident to the vertex 1 whose labels are 4, 6, and 8, and there is only one edge whose label is 1. Therefore, the color of the crossing y is {1|4|7}, {1|6|0}, {1|8|4}, or {6|1|7}.

We deform the diagram near x and y as shown in Figure [\ref=fig4-02] so that the number of crossings of color {1|1|1} is decreased. By repeating this process, we obtain a diagram with no crossing of {1|1|1}.

For any 11-colorable knot K, there is a non-trivially 11-colored diagram (D,C) of K such that

Im(C) = {0,1,4,6,7,8}, and

there is no crossing of color { * |1| * } or {6|6|6}.

We may assume that (D,C) satisfies Lemma [\ref=lem42]. Assume that (D,C) has a crossing of color { * |1| * }. Since there is only one edge labeled 1 in the palette graph G({0,1,4,6,7,8}), the color of the corresponding crossing is {6|1|7}.

There is a 4-arc in (D,C). We will pull the 4-arc toward each crossing of {6|1|7}. In the process, we can assume that the 4-arc crosses over several arcs whose colors are 0,1,4,7,8 missing 6. In fact, since there is no crossing of {6|6|6}, the set of 6-arcs is a disjoint union of intervals in the plane, and the complement in the plane is connected. When the 4-arc crosses over an a-arc for a = 0,1,4,7,8, we have a pair of new crossings of color

[formula]

respectively. See the left of Figure [\ref=fig4-03]. We remark that any vertex of the palette graph G({0,1,4,6,7,8}) other than 6 is 4 itself or incident to an edge labeled 4.

By deforming the diagram near every crossing of {6|1|7} with a 4-arc as shown in the right of the figure, we obtain a diagram with no crossing of {6|1|7}. Then the arcs in the obtained diagram are colored by 0,1,4,6,7,8 and there is no crossing of { * |1| * } or {6|6|6}.

For any 11-colorable knot K, there is an 11-colored diagram (D,C) of K such that

Im(C) = {0,3,4,6,7,8,10},

there is no crossing of color {6|6|6}, and

if {a|b|c} is the color of a crossing and at least one of a,b,c is 3 or 10, then it is one of

[formula]

We may assume that (D,C) satisfies Lemma [\ref=lem43]. Since there are three edges incident to the vertex 1 in the palette graph G({0,1,4,6,7,8}), every crossing with a 1-arc is of color {1|4|7}, {1|6|0}, or {1|8|4}. If there is a crossing of {1|8|4}, we deform the 4-arc near the crossing as shown in Figure [\ref=fig4-04] to replace the crossing with the one of color {1|4|7}. Therefore, we may assume that there is no crossing of {1|8|4}.

There is a 0-arc in (D,C). We will pull the 0-arc toward each crossing of {1|4|7}. In the process, we can assume that the 0-arc crosses over several a-arcs for a∈{0,1,4,7,8} missing 6 by the same reason in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem43]; that is, there is no crossing of {6|6|6}. When the 0-arc crosses over an a-arc, we have a pair of new crossings of color

[formula]

respectively. We remark that the new colors 3 and 10 appear at the crossings of {1|0|10} and {3|0|8}. See Figure [\ref=fig4-05].

By deforming the diagram near every crossing of {1|4|7} with a 0-arc as shown in Figure [\ref=fig4-06], we remove all the crossings of {1|4|7} and produce the color 10 at the crossings of {1|0|10} and {4|7|10}.

There is a 7-arc in (D,C). We will pull the 7-arc toward each 0-arc. In the process, we can assume that the 7-arc crosses over several a-arcs for a∈{0,3,4,6,7,8,10} missing 1; for there is no crossing of {1|1|1}. Then we have a pair of new crossings of

[formula]

respectively. We remark that the colors 3 and 10 appear at the crossings of {0|7|3} and {4|7|10}.

Now, every crossing with a 1-arc is of color {1|6|0} or {1|0|10}. The endpoints of every 1-arc are under-crossings of color

{1|6|0} both,

{1|0|10} both, or

{1|0|10} and {1|6|0}.

For every 1-arc of type (i), we deform the diagram near the 1-arc equipped with a 7-arc into type (ii) as shown in the left of Figure [\ref=fig4-07]. Here, the colors 3 and 10 appear at the crossings of {0|7|3}, {7|3|10}, {0|3|6}, {3|3|3}, and {3|0|8}.

For every 1-arc of type (ii) or (iii), we deform the diagram near the 1-arc with a 7-arc as shown in the center and right of the figure, so that we can remove all the 1-arcs from the diagram. We remark that the colors 3 and 10 appear at the crossings of {4|7|10} for (ii) and {3|0|8} and {7|3|10} for (iii).

Since the original diagram has a 1-arc, at least one of deformations (i), (ii), and (iii) must happen. Therefore, the obtained diagram has a 10-arc. If the diagram has no 3-arc, the case (ii) must happen. By deforming a neighborhood of a crossing of {4|0|7} similarly to Figures [\ref=fig2-04] and [\ref=fig2-05], we can make a pair of crossings of {0|7|3} so that we have Im(C) = {0,3,4,6,7,8,10}.

We remark that the 11-colored diagram (D,C) in Lemma [\ref=lem44] has no crossing of color {3|10|6}, {6|8|10}, or {10|10|10}. In particular, there is no crossing whose over-arc is colored 10.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm11]-Part II

Let G1 be the graph obtained from the palette graph G({0,4,6,7,8}) by adding two vertices 3 and 10 and five edges

[formula]

See Figure [\ref=fig5-01]. In other words, G1 is obtained from G({0,3,4,5,6,8,10}) by deleting the edges {3|10|6} and {6|8|10}.

Assume that (D,C) satisfies Lemma [\ref=lem44]. If {a|c|b} is the non-trivial color of a crossing of (D,C), then the palette graph G1 has the corresponding edge {a|c|b}.

For any 11-colorable knot K, there is an 11-colored diagram (D,C) of K such that

Im(C) = {0,3,4,6,7,8}, and

there is no crossing of color {6|6|6}.

We may assume that (D,C) satisfies Lemma [\ref=lem44]. Since the graph G1 has no edge whose label is 10 and (D,C) has no crossing of {10|10|10}, we see that there is no crossing of color { * |10| * }.

Since there are two edges incident to the vertex 10 in G1, every crossing with a 10-arc is of color {4|7|10} or {7|3|10}. If there is a crossing of {7|3|10}, we deform the 7-arc near the crossing as shown in the left of Figure [\ref=fig5-02] to replace the crossing with one of {4|7|10}. We remark that the crossings of {0|7|3} and {4|0|7} are also produced. Therefore, we may assume that there is no crossing of {7|3|10}.

There is a 0-arc in (D,C). We will pull the 0-arc toward each 10-arc. In the process, we can assume that the 0-arc crosses over several arcs whose colors are 0,3,4,7,8 missing 6 and 10. In fact, since there is no crossing of color

[formula]

the set of 6- and 10-arcs is a disjoint union of intervals, and the complement in the plane is connected. When the 0-arc crosses over an a-arc for a = 0,3,4,7,8, we have a pair of new crossings of color

[formula]

respectively. We remark that any vertex of G1 other than 6 and 10 is 0 itself or incident to an edge labeled 0.

We deform the diagram near every 10-arc with a 0-arc as shown in the right of the figure, so that we remove all the 10-arcs from the diagram. We remark that the crossings of {0|7|3}, {4|0|7}, and {7|7|7} are produced.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm11]-Part III

For any 11-colorable knot K, there is an 11-colored diagram (D,C) of K such that

Im(C) = {0,3,4,6,7,8},

there is no crossing of color {3|3|3}, {4|4|4}, or {6|6|6}.

We may assume that (D,C) satisfies Lemma [\ref=lem51] with Im(C) = {0,3,4,6,7,8}. Figure [\ref=fig6-01] shows the palette graph G({0,3,4,6,7,8}), which is obtained from G1 by deleting the vertex 10 and its incident edges {4|7|10} and {7|3|10}.

There is a 0-arc in (D,C). Similarly to the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem51], we can pull the 0-arc freely without producing new colors. We remark that any vertex of G({0,3,4,6,7,8}) other than 6 is 0 itself or incident to an edge labeled 0. Then we deform the diagram near every 3- or 4-arc with a 0-arc as shown in Figure [\ref=fig6-02] so that there is no crossing of {3|3|3} or {4|4|4}.

For any 11-colorable knot K, there is an 11-colored diagram (D,C) of K such that

Im(C) = {0,3,4,6,7,8},

there is no crossing of color { * |3| * }, {4|4|4}, or {6|6|6}.

We may assume that (D,C) satisfies Lemma [\ref=lem61]. In the palette graph G({0,3,4,6,7,8}), there is only one edge whose label is 3. Therefore, every crossing whose over-arc is 3 has the color {0|3|6}.

There is a 7-arc in (D,C). We will pull the 7-arc toward each crossing of {0|3|6}. Since there is no crossing of {4|4|4}, we can assume that the 7-arc crosses over several arcs whose colors are 0,3,6,7,8 missing 4. If the 7-arc crosses an a-arc for a∈{0,3,6,7,8}, then we have a pair of new crossings of color

[formula]

respectively. We remark that any vertex of G({0,3,4,6,7,8}) other than 4 is 7 itself or incident to an edge labeled 7. We deform the diagram near every crossing of {0|3|6} equipped with a 7-arc as shown in Figure [\ref=fig6-03] to remove all the crossings of {0|3|6}.

We may assume that (D,C) satisfies Lemma [\ref=lem62]. Since there are two edges incident to the vertex 3 in G({0,3,4,6,7,8}), every crossing with a 3-arc is of color {3|0|8} or {0|7|3}. Therefore, the endpoints of every 3-arc are under-crossings of color

{3|0|8} and {0|7|3},

{3|0|8} both, or

{0|7|3} both.

For every 3-arc of type (i), we deform the diagram near the crossing of {0|7|3}, which reduces a 3-arc of type (ii). See the left of Figure [\ref=fig6-04]. Therefore, we may assume that there is no 1-arc of type (i).

To remove a 3-arc of type (ii), We will pull a 7-arc toward the 3-arc. Since there is no crossing of {4|4|4}, the 7-arc can cross over several arcs whose colors are 0,3,6,7,8 missing 4 similarly to the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem62]. We remark that when the 7-arc crosses over an 0- or 3-arc, then we have a pair of new crossings of color {0|7|3}. We deform the diagram near every 3-arc of type (ii) with a 7-arc to remove all the 3-arcs of type (ii). See the center of the figure.

Now, since every crossing with a 3-arc is of color {0|7|3}, every 3-arc is of type (iii). We deform the diagram near every 3-arc of type (iii) with a 7-arc as shown in the right of the figure so that we obtain a diagram with no 3-arc.

For any 11-colorable knot K and [formula], there is an 11-colored diagram (D,C) of K with

[formula]

Let [formula] be the affine map defined by f(x) = 3(b - a)x + a. Since the map f satisfies

[formula]

we have the conclusion by Lemma [\ref=lem210] and Theorem [\ref=thm11](ii).

11-colorable ribbon 2-knot

A ribbon 2-knot [\cite=Fox] is a kind of knotted 2-sphere embedded in [formula]. Such a 2-knot is presented by a diagram in [formula] with only double point circles [\cite=Yaj], the n-colorability is defined similarly to the classical case by assigning an element of [formula] to each sheet of the diagram. Refer to [\cite=CS] for a diagram of a knotted surfaces.

Let K be an 11-colorable ribbon 2-knot. For each set S = {1,4,6,7,8} or {0,4,6,7,8}, there is an 11-colored diagram of K which satisfies the following.

Every double point circle has a neighborhood as shown in Figure [\ref=fig7-01], and all the sheets of the diagram other than the small shaded disks are colored by S.

While the color 2a - b of the shaded disk may not belong to S, the pair (a,b) must satisfy 2b - a∈S.

Let A be a virtual arc which presents K [\cite=Sat]. Since K is 11-colorable, so is A. Then there is an 11-colored diagram (D,C) of A with Im(C) = S by a similar argument in the proof of Theorems [\ref=thm11]. The diagram of K associated to (D,C) is the desired one [\cite=Osh] [\cite=Sat2].

Any 11-colorable ribbon 2-knot satisfies the following.

There is an 11-colored diagram (D1,C1) of K with Im(C1) = {1,4,6,7,8}.

There is an 11-colored diagram (D2,C2) of K with Im(C2) = {0,4,6,7,8}.

(i) We may assume that (D,C) satisfies Lemma [\ref=lem71] for S = {1,4,6,7,8}. In the left of Figure [\ref=fig7-01], the shaded disk is colored 2b - a. The pair (a,b) with a,b,2b - a∈S and [formula] is one of the following:

[formula]

In fact, each edge {x|y|z} in the palette graph G(S) produces such two pairs (y,x) and (y,z).

First, we consider the case (a,b) = (4,1), where the shaded sheet is colored 9. There is an 8-sheet in (D,C). We pull the 8-sheet toward the 9-sheet without introducing new double points and deform the diagram as shown in the left of Figure [\ref=fig7-02] to remove the 9-sheet. We remark that the figure shows a cross-section of the neighborhood of the 9-sheet. Next, we consider the case (a,b) = (4,7), where the shaded sheet is colored 10. We deform the horizontal 4-sheet by surrounding the 10-sheet, that reduces the case (a,b) = (4,1). See the right of the figure.

Let [formula] be the affine map defined by f(x) = 9x + 9. Since we have

[formula]

the cases (a,b) = (1,7), (7,6), (6,8), and (8,4) are obtained from (a,b) = (4,1) by applying f repeatedly, and the cases (a,b) = (1,6), (7,8), (6,4), and (8,1) are obtained from (a,b) = (4,7) similarly.

(ii) We may assume that (D,C) satisfies Lemma [\ref=lem71] for S = {0,4,6,7,8}. The pair (a,b) with a,b,2b - a∈S and [formula] is one of the following:

[formula]

In fact, each edge {x|y|z} in the palette graph G(S) produces such two pairs (y,x) and (y,z) other than (4,8) from {0|4|8} and (0,4) from {4|0|7}.

For the case (a,b) = (4,8), we deform the horizontal 4-sheet by surrounding the shaded 1-sheet as shown in the left of Figure [\ref=fig7-03] so that we can remove the 1-sheet. The case (a,b) = (0,7) can be similarly proved. See the right of the figure.

For the case (a,b) = (7,6), we pull a 0-sheet and deform the diagram as shown in the left of Figure [\ref=fig7-04]. Then we can remove the 5-sheet without introducing new colors. For the case (a,b) = (7,8), we first deform the horizontal 7-sheet by surrounding the shaded 9-sheet, that reduces to the case (a,b) = (7,6).

For the case (a,b) = (6,8), we pull a 7-sheet and surround the shaded 10-sheet by the 7-sheet as shown in the left of Figure [\ref=fig7-05] so that the color 10 is removed. For the case (a,b) = (6,4), we pull a 7-sheet toward the shaded 2-sheet and deform the horizontal 6-sheet to surround the 2-sheet. Then this case reduces to the case (a,b) = (6,8).

For a p-colorable 2-knot K, we denote by Cp(K) the minimum number of #  Im(C) for all non-trivially p-colored diagrams (D,C) of K [\cite=Sat2]. Then the following is an immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm72].

Any 11-colorable ribbon 2-knot K satisfies C11(K) = 5. [formula]

The proof of the following is as same as that of Corollaries [\ref=cor32] and [\ref=cor63].

For any 11-colorable ribbon 2-knot K and [formula], there are 11-colored diagrams (D1,C1) and (D2,C2) of K with
