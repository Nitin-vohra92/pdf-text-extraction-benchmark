Pencils and nets of small degree on curves on smooth, projective surfaces of Picard rank 1 and very ample generator

Introduction

Let C be a smooth curve embedded in [formula], and let |A| be a complete, base-point free linear series grd on C, where r∈{1,2}. Our aim in this paper is to find instances for when |A| is cut out by hyperplane sections restricted to an (n - r - 1)-plane secant on C.

The question in focus has previously been much studied, in particular for the case when [formula]. In [\cite=ciliberto1984uniqueness], it was proven that when C lies on a surface of degree > 4 in [formula], the linear system of plane sections is the only g3deg (C) that exists. In [\cite=basili1996indice], it was proven that when C is a smooth complete intersection curve in [formula], any pencil computing the gonality is given by a plane section minus a multisecant of maximal degree. In [\cite=Hartshorne08], Hartshorne and Schlesinger proved that the gonality of a general ACM curve in [formula] is also computed by multisecants. A further overview of previous research done on gonality and multisecants is given in the introduction of [\cite=Hartshorne08].

This paper is an attempt to prove a slightly more general result for the case where C lies on a smooth, projective surface S with Picard rank 1 and very ample generator. We will here study g1d's of not necessarily minimal degree, in addition to g2d's. The methods we use are taken from [\cite=Hartshorne08]. The idea is to create a map from OS(1) to the grd A on C, and make sure that the map is surjective on global sections.

In what follows, S will denote a smooth, projective surface with Picard group generated by a very ample line bundle OS(H) satisfying h0(OS(H))  ≥  4. This surface could be a K3 surface with Picard rank 1, embedded into projective space using OS(H), or a general complete-intersection surface in [formula] for n  ≥  3, except if it is of degree ≤  3 in [formula] or type (2,2) in [formula] (by a generalisation of the Noether-Lefschetz theorem, see [\cite=lefschetz1921certain]. Also, the introduction in [\cite=kim1991noether] gives a nice overview of further research done in this area).

We will always be considering S as embedded into projective space by OS(H). When writing OS(m), we mean OS(mH). The characteristic is assumed to be 0 throughout the paper.

Our main result is the following:

Let S and OS(H) be as above. Let C∈|OS(m)| for m  ≥  5 be a smooth curve on S. Then any base-point free, complete grd on C, with r∈{1,2} and d  ≤  mH2, is given by restricting hyperplane sections to an (n - r - 1)-plane secant on C.

An immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=Main] is the following:

Let T be the Fano scheme of lines contained in the quadric hypersurface containing S. This scheme corresponds precisely to the set of 3-secant lines on S. The dimension of T is 3.

Let I be the incidence variety given by pairs (C,Γ) such that C is smooth in |OS(m)| and Γ∈T is a 3-secant line on C. Denoting smooth curves in |OS(m)| by |OS(m)|s, we have the following diagram, where p and q denote the natural projections:

[formula]

For any Γ∈T, [formula] will impose 3 independent conditions on the elements in |OS(m)|s. Since the elements in |OS(m)|s are general in |OS(m)|, giving us that dim |OS(m)|s  =   dim |OS(m)| = 3m2 + 1, it is therefore clear that q is surjective, and that each fibre corresponds to a codimension 3 subscheme of |OS(m)|s. Since dim (T) = 3, it follows that each fibre of p must have dimension 0, and so each curve in |OS(m)|s has a finite number of 3-secant lines.

Since S can't have any 4-secant lines, it follows that the minimal degree of a g2d on any C∈|OS(m)|s is C.H - 3 = mH2 - 3 = 6m - 3.

Proof of the theorem

Following the work of Lazarsfeld and Tyurin [\cite=Lazarsfeld] [\cite=Tyurin], given a smooth curve C of genus g on S and a base-point free, complete grd |A| on C, one defines a vector-bundle FC,A on S as the kernel of the evaluation morphism [formula]. The bundle FC,A (or, more frequently, its dual) is often referred to as the associated Lazarsfeld-Mukai bundle of C and A. The bundle has the following properties:

[formula].

[formula].

c2(FC,A) = d.

h0(S,FC,A) = 0.

The dual, [formula], is globally generated away from a finite set.

In the cases we are interested in, where C∈|OS(m)| with m  ≥  5, and d  ≤  mH2, it follows from [\cite=bogomolov1995stable] that FC,A is non-OS(H)-stable. There thus exists a maximal destabilising sequence,

[formula]

where M is a vector-bundle with [formula] satisfying [formula], and N is torsion-free and OS(H)-stable.

Before presenting the proof of Theorem [\ref=Main], we prove the following lemma:

Let FC,A be as above, with C∈|OS(m)|, m  ≥  5, d  ≤  mH2 and r  ≤  2. In the exact sequence [\eqref=exact], we have the following:

c1(M) = OS( - H),

c2(M)  ≥  0, and

c2(N)  ≥  0.

As a consequence of the above, [formula] and [formula].

We begin by proving that c1(M) = OS( - a) for some a > 0. In the case where [formula], this is clear since h0(S,FC,A) = 0. In the case where [formula], we dualise [\eqref=exact] and get

[formula]

where [formula] satisfies [formula]. Since [formula] is globally generated away from a finite set, then the same must be the case for [formula], and so c1() = OS(a) with a  ≥  0 (proof: there exists a saturated sub-linebundle OS(t) with t  ≥  0 which we can inject into [formula], and the cokernel must be globally generated away from a finite set). If a = 0, then [formula]. However, it then follows that c2(FC,A) = 0, which is a contradiction. It follows that a > 0.

We now prove that c2(M) and c2(N) are both nonnegative. Since N is torsion-free and OS(H)-stable, then by [\cite=bogomolov1995stable], c2(N)  ≥  0. The inequality c2(M)  ≥  0 is clear for the [formula] case. For the [formula] case, suppose c2(M) < 0, and note that by [\cite=bogomolov1995stable], M must then be non-OS(H)-stable. This gives us a maximal destabilising sequence

[formula]

where b > 0 since FC,A and hence also M cannot have any global sections; where Iη is the ideal sheaf of a finite subscheme η (possibly empty); and where [formula], implying that 2b < a. Since c2(M) < 0, we have ( - b)(b - a)H2 < 0, implying that b - a > 0, giving us the desired contradiction.

We now prove that a = 1: If c1(M) = OS( - a) and c1(N) = OS(a - m) for a  ≥  2 satisfying [formula], this gives us c2(FC,A)  ≥  c1(M).c1(N) = a(m - a)H2  >  mH2, which contradicts the assumption we have for c2(FC,A). (As long as m  ≥  3, we cannot have c1(M) = OS(1 - m) at the same time as [formula]. The condition m  ≥  5 is to ensure that the inequality a(m - a)H2 > mH2 is strict.)

It now follows that [formula], because of the following: If r = 2 with [formula], then by [\cite=bogomolov1995stable], the stability of N implies that [formula], so that [formula]. This gives us [formula], a contradiction.

We now prove the main theorem.

Let C∈|OS(m)| be smooth, where m  ≥  5, let A be a base-point free, complete grd on C with r∈{1,2} and d  ≤  mH2, and let FC,A be the associated Lazarsfeld-Mukai vector bundle. By Lemma [\ref=lemma], there exists a rank r vector bundle M with c1(M) = OS( - H) and c2(M),c2(N)  ≥  0 such that

[formula]

Because M injects into FC,A, we can compose with the map from FC,A into [formula] and get the following commutative diagram, where G is the cokernel:

[formula]

We see that G is torsion-free, since any possible torsion element of G would map to 0 in A, and by the snake lemma, [formula], which is torsion-free. We have [formula] and c1(G) = OS(1).

Note that h0(N) = 0, since N is torsion-free of rank 1 and has negative c1. This implies that the image of each global section under the map φ must be nonzero in A. Furthermore, since [formula] is surjective on global sections, the same must apply for φ:G  →  A. It follows that h0(S,G) = h0(C,A) = r + 1.

Since [formula], then [formula], where Iξ is the ideal sheaf of a finite subscheme ξ (nonempty because h0(S,OS(1)) > r + 1). Let A'∈|A|. We prove that A' + ξ' = H'|C, where [formula] and H' is a hyperplane section. The map φ corresponds to a nonzero element in [formula]. This implies that [formula], i.e., A' > H'|C  -  ξ' for some hyperplane section H'. Since A is base-point free, then this means that either A' = H'|C  -  ξ' or [formula]. However, since [formula], the latter inequality would imply that OS(1)  →  OC(1) has a nonzero kernel on global sections, which cannot be the case since we are assuming that C∈OS(m) with m  ≥  5. It thus follows that A' = H'|C  -  ξ'. Since |A| is a grd, then the base-locus of the hyperplane sections containing ξ' must be an (n - r - 1)-plane multisecant.

It would be interesting to see if this result can be extended to 3  ≤  r  ≤  H0(OS(1)) - 2. Most of the methods used in Lemma [\ref=lemma] seem to work, but with the excpetion that we lose control over c2(M). However, if we manage to prove that c2(M)  ≥  0 in some (or all) of these cases, then Theorem [\ref=Main] would also apply for these values of r.
