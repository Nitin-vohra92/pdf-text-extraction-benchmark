Path connectedness and entropy density of the space of ergodic hyperbolic measures

Introduction

In this paper we consider homoclinic classes of periodic points for C1 + α diffeomorphisms of compact manifolds and we discuss two properties of the space of invariant measures supported on them and equipped with the week*-topology - connectedness and entropy density of the subspace of hyperbolic ergodic measures. The study of connectedness of the latter space was initiated by Sigmund in a short article [\cite=S77]. He established path connectedness of this space in the case of transitive topological Markov shifts and as a corollary, of Axiom A diffeomorphisms. Sigmund's idea was to show first that any two periodic measures (i.e., invariant atomic measures on periodic points) can be connected by a continuous path of ergodic measures and second that if one of the two periodic measures lies in a small neighborhood of another one, then the whole path can be chosen to lie in this neighborhood. In order to carry out the first step Sigmund shows that any periodic measure can be approximated by Markov measure and that any two Markov measures can be connected by a path of Markov measures. We use Sigmund's idea in our proof of Theorem [\ref=t.main].

A different approach to Sigmund's theorem is to show that ergodic measures on a transitive topological Markov shift are dense in the space of all invariant measures. Since the latter space is a simplex and ergodic measures are its extremal points, it means that this space is the Poulsen simplex (which is unique up to a homeomorphism). The desired result now follows from a complete description of the Poulsen simplex given in [\cite=LOS] (see also [\cite=GK]). We use this approach to prove our Theorem [\ref=t.2].

Since Sigmund's work the interest to the study of connectedness of the space of hyperbolic ergodic measures has somehow been lost, and only recently it has regain attention. In [\cite=GT] Gogolev and Tahzibi, motivated by their study of existence of non-hyperbolic invariant measures, raised a question of whether the space of ergodic measures invariant under some partially hyperbolic systems is path connected. This includes, in particular, the famous example by Shub and Wilkinson [\cite=SW]. Some results on connectedness and other topological properties of the space of invariant measures were obtained in [\cite=BG] [\cite=GK].

All known proofs of connectedness of the space of invariant measures are based on approximating invariant measures by either measures supported on periodic orbits or Markov ergodic measures supported on invariant horseshoes. It is therefore natural to ask whether such approximations can be arranged to also ensure convergence of entropies. If this is possible, the space of approximants is called entropy dense. Some results in this direction were obtained in [\cite=FO]. We stress that approximating hyperbolic ergodic measures with positive entropy by "nice" measures supported on invariant horseshoes so that the convergence of entropies is also guaranteed, was first done by Katok in [\cite=K] (see also [\cite=BP] [\cite=KH]). We use this result in the proof of our Theorem [\ref=t.entropydense] where we approximate also some hyperbolic ergodic measures with zero entropy as well as non-ergodic measures.

We shall now state our results. Consider a C1 + α-diffeomorphism f:M  →  M of a compact smooth manifold M. Let p∈M be a hyperbolic periodic point. We say that a hyperbolic periodic point q∈M is homoclinically related to p and write q  ~  p if the stable manifold of q has transversal intersections with the unstable manifold of p and vise versa. We denote by H(p) the homoclinic class associated with the point p, that is the closure of the set of hyperbolic periodic points homoclinically related to p.

A basic hyperbolic set gives the simplest example of a homoclinic class, but in general the set H(p) can have a much more complicated structure and dynamical properties. In particular, it can contain non-hyperbolic periodic points, and it can support hon-hyperbolic measures in a robust way, see [\cite=BBD] [\cite=BDGor] [\cite=DG] [\cite=KN]. Moreover - and this is of importance for us in this paper - there may exist hyperbolic periodic points in H(p) that are not homoclinically related to p, see [\cite=DG] [\cite=DHRS]. Besides, it can happen that periodic orbits outside the homoclinic class H(p) accumulate to H(p); for example, this is part of the Newhouse phenomena, and also occurs in the family of standard maps, see [\cite=Du] [\cite=Gor]. We wish to avoid both of these complications, and we therefore, impose the following crucial requirements on the homoclinic class H(p). By the index s(p) of a hyperbolic periodic point p we mean the dimension of the invariant unstable manifold of p.

We stress that these requirements do hold in many interesting cases, see examples in Section [\ref=s.examples]. In particular, Condition (H2) holds if the map f has only one homoclinic class. This is the case in Examples 1 and 2 in Section [\ref=s.examples]. We also note a result in [\cite=BG] that is somewhat related to Condition (H2): if the map f admits a dominated splitting of index s, then a linear combination of hyperbolic ergodic measures of index s can be approximated by a sequence of hyperbolic ergodic measures of index s if and only if their homoclinic classes coincide.

The space of all invariant ergodic measures supported on H(p) can be extremely reach and contain hyperbolic measures with different number of positive Lyapunov exponents as well as non-hyperbolic measures. We denote by Mp the space of all hyperbolic invariant measures supported on H(p) for which the number of positive Lyapunov exponents at almost every point is exactly s(p). Further, we denote by Mep the space of all hyperbolic ergodic measures with s(p) positive Lyapunov exponents which are supported on H(p). We assume that the space Mp is equipped with the weak*-topology.

Under Conditions (H1) and (H2) the space Mep is path connected.

Notice that without Conditions (H1) and (H2) the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=t.main] may fail, see Subsection [\ref=ss.2]. It follows immediately from Theorem [\ref=t.main] that the closure of Mp is connected. In fact, a stronger statement holds.

Under Conditions (H1) and (H2) the closure of the space Mep is path connected.

We shall now discuss the entropy density of the space Mep.

Under Conditions (H1) and (H2) the space Mep is entropy dense in Mp.

Examples

In this section we present some examples that illustrate importance of Conditions (H1) and (H2).

Homoclinic classes satisfying Conditions (H1) and (H2).

We describe a class of diffeomorphisms with partially hyperbolic attractors for which the attractor is the homoclinic class of any of its periodic point and which satisfies Conditions (H1) and (H2). We follow [\cite=BDPP]. Let f be a C1 + α diffeomorphism of a compact smooth manifold M and Λ a topological attractor for f. This means that there is an open set U  ⊂  M such that [formula] and [formula]. We assume that Λ is a partially hyperbolic set for f, that is for every x∈Λ there is an invariant splitting of the tangent space [formula] into stable Es(x), central Ec(x) and unstable Eu(x) subspaces such that [formula] for every v∈Es(x), [formula] for every v∈Ec(x), [formula] for every v∈Eu(x), where

[formula]

are some constants and λ1 < 1, λ4 > 1.

If Λ is a partially hyperbolic attractor for f, then for every x∈Λ one can construct a global unstable leaf Wu(x) through x such that TyWu(x) = Eu(y) for every y∈Wu(x). It is easy to see that for every x∈Λ we have Wu(x)  ⊂  Λ and that f(Wu(x)) = Wu(f(x)). Moreover, the collection of all global unstable leaves Wu(x) forms a continuous lamination of Λ with smooth leaves, and if Λ = M, then it is a continuous foliation of M with smooth leaves.

An invariant measure μ on Λ is called a u-measure if the conditional measures it generates on the unstable leaves Wu(x) are equivalent to the leaf volume on Wu(x) induced by the Riemannian metric (see [\cite=PS]). Following [\cite=BDPP] we say that a u-measure μ has negative central exponents on an invariant subset A  ⊂  Λ of positive measure if for every x∈A and v∈TxEc(x) the Lyapunov exponent χ(x,v) < 0.

We consider the following requirement on the map f|Λ:

for every x∈Λ the positive semi-trajectory of the global unstable leaf Wu(x) is dense in Λ that is

[formula]

It is shown in [\cite=BDPP] that if μ is a u-measure on Λ and if f satisfies Condition (D), then 1) μ has negative central exponents at almost every point x∈Λ; 2) μ is the unique SRB-measure for f supported on the whole Λ; and 3) the basin of attraction for μ coincides with the open set U.

It is easy to see that in this case

the attractor Λ is the homoclinic class of every of its hyperbolic periodic points of index equal to the dimension of the unstable leaves; these periodic orbits are dense in Λ;

the homoclinic class satisfies Conditions (H1) and (H2), and hence Theorems [\ref=t.main], [\ref=t.2], and [\ref=t.entropydense] are applicable.

Condition (D) clearly holds if the unstable lamination is minimal, i.e., every leaf of the lamination is dense in Λ.

Let f0 be a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism which is either 1) a skew product with the map in the base being a topologically transitive Anosov diffeomorphism or 2) the time-1 map of an Anosov flow. If f is a small perturbation of f0 then f is partially hyperbolic and by [\cite=HPS], the central distribution of f is integrable. Furthermore, the central leaves are compact in the first case and there are compact leaves in the second case. It is shown in [\cite=BDPP] that f has minimal unstable foliation provided there exists a compact periodic central leaf C (i.e., [formula] for some [formula]) for which the restriction [formula] is a minimal transformation.

Furthermore, it follows from the results in [\cite=BB] that starting from a volume preserving partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism f0 with one-dimensional central subspace, it is possible to construct a C2 volume preserving diffeomorphism f which is arbitrarily C1-close to f0 and has negative central exponents on a set of positive volume. Moreover, if C is a compact periodic central leaf, then f can be arranged to coincide with f0 in a small neighborhood of the trajectory of C.

We now consider the two particular examples.

Example 1. Consider the time-1 map f0 of the geodesic flow on a compact surface of negative curvature. Clearly, f0 is partially hyperbolic and has a dense set of compact periodic central leaves. It follows from what was said above that there is a volume preserving perturbation f of f0 such that

f is of class C2 and is arbitrary close to f0 in the C1-topology;

f is a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism with one-dimensional central subspace;

there exists a central leaf C such that the restriction [formula] is a minimal transformation (here [formula] is the period of the leaf);

f has negative central exponents on a set of positive volume;

the unstable foliation for f is minimal and hence, satisfies Condition (D).

We conclude that in this example the whole manifold is the homoclinic class of every hyperbolic periodic point of index one and that this class satisfies Conditions (H1) and (H2).

Example 2. Consider the map f0 = A  ×  R of the 3-torus T3 = T2  ×  T1 where A is a linear Anosov automorphism of the 2-torus T2 and R is an irrational rotation of the circle T1. It follows from what was said above that there is a volume preserving perturbation f of f0 such that the properties (1) - (5) in the previous example hold, and hence the unique homoclinic class satisfies Conditions (H1) and (H2).

It was shown in [\cite=BDU] that the set of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with one dimensional central direction contains an open and dense subset of diffeomorphisms with minimal unstable foliation. However, in our examples we use preservation of volume to ensure negative central Lyapunov exponents on a set of positive volume, so we cannot immediately apply the result in [\cite=BDU] to obtain an open set of systems for which Conditions (H1) and (H2) hold, compare with Problem 7.25 from [\cite=BDV].

In both Examples 1 and 2 the map possesses a non-hyperbolic ergodic invariant measure (e.g. supported on the compact periodic leaf). We believe that in these examples presence of non-hyperbolic ergodic invariant measures is persistent under small perturbations. Indeed, since the central subspace is one dimensional, the central Lyapunov exponent with respect to a given ergodic measure is an integral of a continuous function (i.e., log of the expansion rate along the central subspace) over this measure, existence of periodic points of different indices combined with (presumable) connectedness of the space of ergodic measures should imply existence of a non-hyperbolic invariant ergodic measure. See [\cite=BBD] [\cite=BDGor] [\cite=DGor] [\cite=GIKN] for the related results and discussion.

Homoclinic classes that do not satisfy Conditions (H1) and (H2).

There is an example of an invariant set for a partially hyperbolic map with one dimensional central subspace which is a homoclinic class containing two non-homoclinically related hyperbiolic periodic orbits, hence, not satisfying Condition (H1), see [\cite=DG] [\cite=DHRS] [\cite=DGR]. Moreover, the space of hyperbolic ergodic measures supported on this homoclinic class is not connected due to the fact that the set of all central Lyapunov exponents is split into two disjoint closed intervals, see Remark 5.2 in [\cite=DGR].

Condition (H2) ensures that the horseshoes and periodic orbits that we use to approximate a given hyperbolic ergodic measure do belong to the initial homoclinic class. We do not know whether given a not necessarily isolated homoclinic class, every hyperbolic ergodic invariant measure supported on this homoclinic class can always be approximated in such a way.

Proofs

The space M of all probability Borel measures on M equipped with the weak*-topology is metrizable with the distance dM given by

[formula]

where [formula] is a dense subset in the unit ball in C0(M). While the distance defined in this way depends on the choice of the subset [formula], the topology it generates does not. We will choose the functions fk to be smooth.

By a periodic hyperbolic measure μq we mean an atomic ergodic measure equidistributed on a hyperbolic periodic orbit of q.

Let q1,q2∈H(p) be hyperbolic periodic points with the same index as p. Then the periodic hyperbolic measures μq1 and μq2 can be connected in Mp by a continuous path.

By Condition (H1) the points q1 and q2 are homoclinically related. By the Smale-Birkhoff theorem, there is a locally maximal invariant hyperbolic horseshoe Λ that contains both q1 and q2. Lemma [\ref=l.0] now follows from the results by Sigmund, see [\cite=S77].

We wish to approximate a given hyperbolic measure by periodic measures. There are several results in this direction, see, for example, [\cite=BP]. However, we need some specific properties of such approximations that are stated in the following lemma.

For any hyperbolic ergodic measure μ and for any ε > 0 the following statements hold:

There exists a periodic hyperbolic measure μq such that dM(μq,μ) < ε;

There exists δ > 0 such that for any periodic hyperbolic measures μq1 and μq2 in the δ-neighborhood of the measure μ there exists a continuous path {νt}t∈[0,1]  ⊂  Mp with ν0  =  μq1, ν1  =  μq2 and such that dM(νt,μ) < ε for all t∈[0,1].

Let R be the set of all Lyapunov-Perron regular points, and for each [formula] let [formula] be the regular set. There exists [formula] such that [formula]. Fix ε > 0. For a μ-generic point [formula], by Birkhoff's Ergodic Theorem, there exists [formula] such that for any n > N

[formula]

Choose [formula] such that [formula]. For the dense collection of smooth functions {fk} from the definition ([\ref=e.dist]) of the distance dM, denote by C = C(ε) the common Lipschitz constant of the functions [formula]. Let us now choose δ > 0 such that [formula]. By [\cite=BP], there exists n > N and a periodic point y∈M of period n such that [formula] for all [formula]. We have

[formula]

The first statement of the lemma now follows from ([\ref=e.defdist]) and ([\ref=e.sums]).

We now compete the proof of Theorem [\ref=t.main]. Let η and [formula] be two hyperbolic ergodic measures. By Lemma [\ref=l.1], there are sequences of periodic hyperbolic measures [formula] and [formula] such that μqk  →  η, [formula]. By Condition (H2), the homoclinic class H(p) is isolated, and hence, the points qk and [formula] belong to H(p) for large k. By Lemma [\ref=l.0], there is a path [formula] in Mp that connects μq1 and [formula], that is, [formula] and [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=l.1], for any [formula] there are paths

[formula]

in Mp that connect measures μqk, μqk + 1 and measures [formula], [formula], respectively. Moreover, by Lemma [\ref=l.1], the path {νt}t∈[0,1] given by the above choices and such that ν0  =  η, [formula] is continuous.

Given a (not necessarily ergodic) measure μ∈M, by the ergodic decomposition, there exists a measure ν on the space Mep such that

[formula]

It follows that for any ε > 0 there are measures [formula] and positive coefficients [formula] such that

[formula]

Given a hyperbolic ergodic measure t with ht > 0, there exist a sequence of invariant horseshoes Λn and a sequence of ergodic measures [formula] supported on Λn such that νn  →  t and hνn  →  ht as n  →    ∞  , see, for example, Corollary 15.6.2 in [\cite=BP]. One can ensure in the construction of these horseshoes that Λn  ⊆  H(p) and that νn are the measures of maximal entropy and hence, Markov measures, see also [\cite=S].

In the case when ht = 0 the measure t can be approximated by a periodic hyperbolic measure supported on an orbit of a hyperbolic periodic point q. By Condition (H2), the homoclinic class H(p) is isolated and therefore, q∈H(p). The first return map to a small neighborhood of q contains a horseshoe of topological dimension 2 that belongs to H(p). If the neighborhood is taken sufficiently small, the topological entropy of the map restricted to the whole horseshoe will become arbitrarily small. It follows that any Markov measure on this horseshoe must have small entropy and be close to the periodic measure supported on the orbit of the periodic point q (notice that the support of this Markov measure does not have to be close to the orbit of q).

It follows from what was said above that for each ergodic measure tk we can associate a topologically transitive invariant horseshoe Λk and a Markov measure νk supported on Λk such that for every [formula] we have

[formula]

Notice that all horseshoes Λk have the same index s(p) and that they are homoclinically related. This implies that there exists a topologically transitive horseshoe Λ  ⊂  H(p) that contains all Λk.

The Markov measure νk is constructed with respect to a Markov partition of Λk that we denote by ξk. There exists a Markov partition ξ of Λ such that its restriction on each Λk is a refinement of ξk. The measure [formula] is a Markov measure on Λ with respect to the partition ξ. Notice that Markov measures as well as their entropies depend continuously on their stochastic matrices. Therefore, given an arbitrarily (not necessarily ergodic) Markov measure, one can produce its small perturbation which is an ergodic Markov measure whose entropy is close to the entropy of the unperturbed one. This gives the required approximation of the measure [formula], which by ([\ref=f.1]) and ([\ref=f.2]) is close to the initial measure μ.

Notice that Mp is a convex set. Indeed, if μ1,μ2∈Mp, then for any t∈[0,1] the measure tμ1 + (1 - t)μ2 is hyperbolic with the same number of positive Lyapunov exponents and hence, it belongs to Mp. It follows from Theorem [\ref=t.entropydense] that

[formula]

This means that [formula], and since [formula] is a simplex, it must be a Poulson simplex. The desired result follows now from [\cite=LOS] (see also [\cite=GK]).
