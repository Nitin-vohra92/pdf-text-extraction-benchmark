Introduction

Under the flourishing research activity on D-branes in string theory, the role of special Lagrangian submanifolds in physics has become more and more relevant (see for example [\cite=BeBeS]) untill it was eventually conjectured in [\cite=SYZ] that they can be considered as the cornerstones of the mirror phenomenon. Indeed, D-branes are special Lagrangian submanifolds equipped with a flat U(1) line bundle. In physical literature, special Lagrangian submanifolds of the compactification space are related to physical states which retain part of the vacuum supersymmetry: for this reason they are often called supersymmetric cycles or BPS states.

Despite their importance, there are very few explicit examples of special Lagrangian submanifolds, especially in Calabi-Yau 3-folds. However, in an irreducible symplectic 4-fold (realized as a hyperkaehler manifold) we have a complete control of the special Lagrangian geometry of its submanifolds, via a sort of �hyperkaehler trick�; moreover this enables us to prove that special Lagrangian submanifolds retain part of the rigidity of complex submanifolds.

We first recall the following:

Definition 1.1: A complex manifold X is called irreducible symplectic if it satisfies the following three conditions:

1) X is compact and Kaehler;

2) X is simply connected;

3) H0(X,Ω2X) is spanned by an everywhere non-degenerate 2-form ω.

In particular, irreducible symplectic manifolds are special cases of Calabi-Yau manifolds (the top holomorphic form which trivializes the canonical line bundle is given by a suitable power of the holomorphic 2-form ω). In dimension 2, K3 surfaces are the only irreducible symplectic manifolds, and indeed irreducible symplectic manifolds appear as higher-dimensional analogues of K3 surfaces, as strongly suggested in [\cite=Hu]. Unfortunately, up to now there are very few explicit examples of irreducible symplectic manifolds. Indeed almost all known examples turn out to be birational to two standard series of examples: Hilbert schemes of points on K3 surfaces and generalized Kummer varieties (both series were first studied in [\cite=Beau]), but quite recently O'Grady has constructed irreducible symplectic manifolds which are not birational to any of the elements of the two groups (see [\cite=Ogra]).

Finally, let us recall from [\cite=HL] the following:

Definition 1.2: Let X be a Calabi-Yau n-fold, with Kaehler form ω and holomorphic nowhere vanishing n-form Ω. A (real) n-dimensional submanifold [formula] of X is called special Lagrangian if the following two conditions are satisfied:

1) Λ is Lagrangian with respect to ω, i.e. j*ω = 0;

2) there exists a multiple Ω' of Ω such that j*Im(Ω')=0; one can prove (see [\cite=HL]) that both conditions are equivalent to:

1') j*Re(Ω') = Volg(Λ).

The condition 1') in the previous definition means that the real part of Ω' restricts to the volume form of Λ, induced by the Calabi-Yau Riemannian metric g. In this way special Lagrangian submanifolds are considered as a type of calibrated submanifolds (see [\cite=HL] for further details on this point).

Characterization of special Lagrangian submanifolds

In this section we will describe all special Lagrangian submanifolds of an irreducible symplectic 4-fold X (having fixed a Kaehler class

[formula]

Concluding remarks

It is important to remark that all previous results are true also for special Lagrangian submanifolds of K3 surfaces, but their proof is completely trivial in that case.

Another observation is related to singular Lagrangian submanifolds: indeed, by the previous results, it turns out that we can also give examples of special Lagrangian subvarieties, obtained via hyperkaehler rotation of Lagrangian complex subvarieties. On the other hand, contrary to the case of the corresponding submanifolds, we can not expect that all special Lagrangian subvarieties are obtained in this way, and consequently we can not expect that all special Lagrangian subvarieties are real analytic. Indeed, there are examples (compare [\cite=HL]) of singular special Lagrangian submanifold in Cn which are only smooth, but not real analytic.

The discussion about singular Lagrangian submanifolds leads us to comment on the mirror symmetry construction suggested in [\cite=SYZ]. Indeed, according to the recipe of [\cite=SYZ], any Calabi-Yau X, admitting a mirror X̂, has a peculiar fibre space structure: on a physical ground it is argued that X can be realized as the total space of a fibration in special Lagrangian tori. Unfortunately, there are very few examples of such realization: in particular, as far as we know, there is only one (partial) example for Calabi-Yau 3-folds of the so called Borcea-Voisin type (see [\cite=GW]). Instead, in the case of irreducible symplectic projective manifolds the situation is completely different. Indeed, a recent result of Matsushita (see [\cite=Mat1] and [\cite=Mat2]) shows that for any fibre space structure f:X  →  B of a projective irreducible symplectic manifold X, with projective base B, the generic fibre f- 1(b) is an Abelian variety (up to finite unramified cover), and it is also Lagrangian with respect to the non degenerate holomorphic 2-form Ω; moreover, in the case of 4-folds one can prove that the generic fibre is an Abelian surface and f is equidimensional, (i.e. all irreducible components of the fibres have the same dimension). By Corollary 2.1 it turns out that this fibre space structure can also be realized as a special Lagrangian torus fibration; moreover, in this case all special Lagrangian fibres, even the singular ones, are analytic, since they are obtained by performing a hyperkaehler rotation starting from Lagrangian Abelian surfaces. So, in these cases, we have special Lagrangian torus fibration in which all fibres are analytic: one can hope to understand the degeneration types of singular special Lagrangian tori, moving from these constructions.

Explicit examples of projective irreducible symplectic 4-folds, fibered over a projective base have been constructed by Markuschevich in [\cite=Mar1] and [\cite=Mar2]. One of this constructions is the following: consider a double cover π:S  →  P2 of the projective plane, ramified along a smooth sextic [formula] (S is then realized as a K3 surface). Since any line in P2 will intersect generically the sextic C in six distinct point, we have that the covering π:S  →  P2 determines a (flat) family of hyperelliptic curves over the dual projective plane f:X  →  P2. Then the Altmann-Kleiman compactification of the relative Jacobian of the family turns out to be a simplectic projective irreducible 4-folds, fibered over P2, and in fact all fibres are Lagrangian Abelian varieties.

Finally, we believe that our characterization of special Lagrangian submanifolds of irreducible symplectic 4-folds can be extended also to higher dimensional irreducible symplectic manifolds: to this aim notice that the proof we have given becomes longer and longer, since one has to deal with new cases and subcases. It would be nice, instead, to find out a sort of inductive argument, which works for all dimensions.
