Topological [formula]-groups

Introduction

One of the main structure theorems for compact groups (see [\cite=hofmor98]) can be formulated as follows.

The above statement clearly shows that the classes of zero-dimensional groups, abelian groups and simple, simply connected Lie groups play a central role in the general theory of compact groups. Recently these classes of topological groups have been studied from the point of view of absolute extensors in dimension n (see [\cite=chibook96] for a comprehensive introduction into the theory of absolute extensors in dimension n). The following three statements show that such an approach is quite effective.

The full classification problem for non-abelian (see Theorem C) and for non-simply connected compact [formula]-groups remains open. On the other hand, the following two statements provide a complete classification of simply connected compact [formula]-groups.

We complete this brief survey by pointing out that, as shows the following statement, for locally compact groups the restriction of being [formula]-group is purely formal.

Below we study [formula]-groups. The class of [formula]-groups contains the class of all (generally speaking, non-metrizable) locally compact groups (Theorem G) as well as the class of all Polish groups. Actually the class of Polish groups coincides with the class of metrizable [formula]-groups and forms a foundation of the entire theory of [formula]-groups. We hope that results presented in Section [\ref=S:spectral] do indicate a potential for a non-trivial theory of [formula]-groups which unifies and generalizes theories of locally compact and Polish groups (thus offering a possible approach to the corresponding question posed in [\cite=pest99]).

In Section [\ref=S:spectral] we present a spectral characterization of [formula]-groups in terms of well ordered continuous inverse spectra (Theorem [\ref=T:ae0]). This characterization states that a non-metrizable topological group G of weight τ is a [formula]-group if and only if it is the limit of a well ordered continuous inverse system SG  =  {Gα,pα + 1α,α  <  τ} of length τ, consisting of [formula]-groups Gα and 0-soft limit homomorphisms pα + 1α:Gα + 1  →  Gα, α  <  τ, so that G0 is a Polish group and each homomorphism pα + 1α, α  <  τ, has a Polish kernel.

Obviously this result can not be accepted as the one providing a satisfactory reduction of the non-metrizable case to the Polish one. Of course, everything is fine if the weight of G is ω1 - in such a case all Gα's, α  <  ω1, (and not only the very first one, i.e. G0) are indeed Polish. But if the weight of G is greater than ω1, then all Gα's, with α  ≥  ω1, are non-metrizable.

In order to achieve our final goal and complete the reduction, we analyze 0-soft homomorphisms with Polish kernels between (generally speaking, non-metrizable) [formula]-groups. A characterization of such homomorphisms, which is recorded in Proposition [\ref=P:polishkernel], states that a 0-soft homomorphism f:G  →  L of [formula]-groups has a Polish kernel if and only if there exists a pullback diagram

[formula]

where G0 and L0 are Polish groups and the homomorphisms p:G  →  G0 and q:L  →  L0 are 0-soft. Theorem [\ref=T:ae0] and Proposition [\ref=P:polishkernel] together complete the required reduction.

Polish groups and their actions have been extensively studied in a variety of directions (ergodic theory, group representations, operator algebras; see [\cite=bekech96] for further discussion and references). Some of the central themes of the theory of Polish groups counterparts of which (for arbitrary [formula]-groups) are considered below are the existence of universal groups, the existence of universal actions and characterization of closed subgroups of the symmetric group S∞.

In Section [\ref=S:applications] we use above mentioned spectral characterizations and present extensions of some of these results for [formula]-groups. We prove the existence of universal [formula]-groups of a given weight (Proposition [\ref=P:univ]) and the existence of universal actions of [formula]-groups of a given weight on compact [formula]-spaces of the same weight (Theorem [\ref=T:actionuniv]).

Theorem [\ref=T:closed] characterizes [formula]-groups which are isomorphic to closed subgroups of powers Sτ∞ of the symmetric group S∞ - the group of all bijections of [formula] under the relative topology inherited from [formula]. This result extends the corresponding observation [\cite=bekech96] for the group S∞ itself. As a corollary (Corollary [\ref=C:polish]) we note that if a Polish group G can be embedded (as a closed subgroup) into Sτ∞ for some τ, then G can be embedded into S∞ as well. In light of [\cite=dough94] this shows that there exist zero-dimensional Polish groups which can not be embedded into Sτ∞ as closed subgroups for any cardinal number τ.

Finally we use Theorem [\ref=T:ae0] to prove (Theorem [\ref=T:baire]) that every [formula]-group is Baire isomorphic to the product of Polish groups. In light of Theorem G this result appears to be new even for compact groups.

Preliminaries

All topological spaces below are assumed to be Tychonov (i.e. completely regular and Hausdorff) and all maps (except in Subsection [\ref=SS:baire]) are continuous. We consider only Lebesgue dimension dim . Definitions of concepts related to inverse spectra can be found in [\cite=chibook96]. [formula] denotes the real line and [formula] stand for the Hilbert cube.

Definitions of [formula]-spaces and n-soft maps

A comprehensive introduction into general theory of [formula]-spaces and n-soft maps can be found in [\cite=chibook96]. C(X) denotes the set of all continous real-valued functions defined on X.

For compact spaces this definition is equivalent to the standard one.

It is known [\cite=chibook96] that the class of metrizable [formula]-spaces coincides with the class of Polish spaces. Every [formula]-spaces has a countable Suslin number.

It is easy to check that X is [formula]-space if and only if the constant map [formula] is n-soft. It is important to note that every 0-soft map between [formula]-spaces is surjective and open ([\cite=chibook96]) and that for surjections between Polish spaces the converse of this fact is also true.

We say (see [\cite=chibook96]) that a map f:X  →  Y has a Polish kernel if there exists a Polish space P such that X is C-embedded in the product Y  ×  P so that f coincides with the restriction πY|X of the projection πY:Y  ×  P  →  Y. Obviously any map between Polish spaces has a Polish kernel.

Set-theoretical preliminaries

Let A be a partially ordered directed set (i.e. for every two elements α,β∈A there exists an element γ∈A such that γ  ≥  α and γ  ≥  β). We say that a subset A1  ⊆  A of A majorates another subset A2  ⊆  A of A if for each element α2∈A2 there exists an element α1∈A1 such that α1  ≥  α2. A subset which majorates A is called cofinal in A. A subset of A is said to be a chain if every two elements of it are comparable. The symbol sup B , where B  ⊆  A, denotes the lower upper bound of B (if such an element exists in A). Let now τ be an infinite cardinal number. A subset B of A is said to be τ-closed in A if for each chain C  ⊆  B, with |C|  ≤  τ, we have sup C∈B, whenever the element sup C exists in A. Finally, a directed set A is said to be τ-complete if for each chain B of elements of A with |C|  ≤  τ, there exists an element sup C in A.

The standard example of a τ-complete set can be obtained as follows. For an arbitrary set A let exp A denote, as usual, the collection of all subsets of A. There is a natural partial order on exp A: A1  ≥  A2 if and only if A1  ⊇  A2. With this partial order exp A becomes a directed set. If we consider only those subsets of the set A which have cardinality ≤  τ, then the corresponding subcollection of exp A, denoted by exp τA, serves as a basic example of a τ-complete set. Proofs of the following statements can be found in [\cite=chibook96].

For each subset B, with |B|  ≤  τ, of a τ-complete set A there exists an element γ∈A such that γ  ≥  β for each β∈B .

Baire sets and Baire isomorphisms

Recall that elements of the σ-algebra generated by functionally open subsets of a space X are called Baire sets of X. A map f:X  →  Y is a Baire map if inverse images of Baire sets are Baire sets. A bijection f:X  →  Y is Baire isomorphism if both f and f- 1 are Baire maps.

The following statement ([\cite=chi994]) is used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=T:baire].

If f is a continuous homomorphism of Polish groups, then the existence of such a g has been observed by Dixmier [\cite=bekech96], [\cite=kech95]).

[formula]-groups and actions of [formula]-groups - spectral representations

In this section we present spectral characterizations of [formula]-groups. We also present a spectral description of actions of [formula]-groups on [formula]-spaces.

By [\cite=chibook96], the space G can be represented as the limit space of a factorizing ω-spectrum [formula] consisting of Polish spaces (i.e. [formula]-spaces of countable weight) and 0-soft limit projections. Let us show that this spectrum contains ω-closed and cofinal subspectrum consisting of topological groups and limit projections that are (continuous) homomorphisms.

Let μ:G  ×  G  →  G and ν:G  →  G be continuous operations of multiplication and inversion given on G as on a topological group. We apply [\cite=chibook96] to both μ and ν. First consider the multiplication. Clearly, G  ×  G is the limit space of the spectrum

[formula]

All projections of the spectrum S  ×  S are 0-soft, and hence, by [\cite=chibook96], open. The Suslin number of the product G  ×  G is obviously countable (see [\cite=chibook96]). Consequently, by [\cite=chibook96], the spectrum S  ×  S is factorizing. Next we apply [\cite=chibook96] to the spectra S  ×  S, S and to the map μ between their limit spaces. Then we get a ω-closed and cofinal subset Aμ of [formula] such that for each α∈Aμ there exists a continuous map μα:Gα  ×  Gα  →  Gα such that the diagram

[formula]

commutes. In other words, [formula] for each α∈Aμ.

Next consider a continuous inversion ν:G  →  G. By [\cite=chibook96], applied to ν and the spectrum S, there exists a ω-closed and cofinal subset Aν of [formula] such that for each α∈Aν there exists a continuous map να:Gα  →  Gα such that the diagram

[formula]

commutes. In other words, [formula] for each α∈Aν.

By Proposition [\ref=P:3.1.1], the intersection [formula] is still ω-closed and cofinal in [formula]. This guarantees that G is topologically and algebraically isomorphic to the limit of the factorizing ω-spectrum SG  =  {Gα,pβα,A}. Also for each α∈A we have two maps

[formula]

which allow us to define

a continuous multiplication operation on Gα by letting

[formula]

a continuous inversion on Gα by letting

[formula]

It is easy to see that Gα,  α∈A, becomes a topological group with respect to these operations. Moreover, for each α∈A the limit projection pα:G  →  Gα becomes a homomorphism with respect to the above defined operations.

Let G be a [formula]-group such that dim G  ≤  n. Then G is topologically and algebraically isomorphic to the limit of a factorizing ω-spectrum SG  =  {Gα,pβα,A} consisting of at most n-dimensional Polish groups Gα, α∈A, and 0-soft limit homomorphisms pα:G  →  Gα, α∈A.

By Proposition [\ref=P:B8.2.1], G  =   lim S1, where S1  =  {Gα,pβα,A1} is a factorizing ω-spectrum consisting of Polish groups and 0-soft limit homomorphisms. By [\cite=chibook96], G  =   lim S2, where S2  =  {Gα,pβα,A2} is a factorizing ω-spectrum consisting of at most n-dimensional Polish spaces. It follows directly from the proofs of Proposition [\ref=P:B8.2.1] and [\cite=chibook96], that both indexing sets A1 and A2 can be assumed to be closed and ω-complete subsets of a ω-complete set B. By Proposition [\ref=P:3.1.1], [formula] is still cofinal and ω-closed subset of B. Consequesntly, the factorizing ω-spectrum SG  =  {Gα,pβα,A} consists of at most n-dimensional Polish groups and 0-soft limit homomorphisms. It only remains to note that G  =   lim SG.

Let τ  ≥  ω. Every [formula]-group of weight τ  ≥  ω is topologically and algebraically isomorphic to a closed and [formula]-embedded subgroup of the product [formula], where Gt, t∈T, is a Polish group and |T|  =  τ.

Let G be an [formula]-group of weight τ. If τ  =  ω, then G is Polish (see [\cite=chibook96] and consequently there is nothing to prove.

If τ  >  ω, then by Proposition [\ref=P:B8.2.1], G is topologically and algebraically isomorphic to the limit of a factorizing ω-spectrum [formula] with |T|  =  τ. Clearly lim SG is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of the product [formula]. Since the spectrum SG is factorizing, it follows that lim SG is [formula]-embedded in [formula].

Let G be a topological group of weight τ  >  ω. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

G is a [formula]-group.

There exists a well-ordered inverse spectrum SG  =  {Gα,pα + 1α,τ} satisfying the following properties:

Gα is a [formula]-group and pα + 1α:Gα + 1  →  Gα is a 0-soft homomorphism with Polish kernel, α  <  τ.

If β  <  τ is a limit ordinal, then the diagonal product

[formula]

is a topological and algebraic isomorphism.

G is topologically and algebraically isomorphic to lim SG.

G0 is a Polish group.

(a) [formula] (b). By Corollary [\ref=C:emb], we may assume that G is a closed and [formula]-embedded subgroup of the product [formula], |A|  =  τ, of Polish groups Xa, a∈A. There exists a proper, functionally closed and 0-invertible map [formula], where Y is a spectrally complete (see [\cite=chibook96]) realcompact space of weight τ and dimension dim Y  =  0 (see [\cite=chibook96] for details). Consider the inverse image f- 1(G)  ⊆  Y of G and the map f|f- 1:f- 1(G)  →  G. Since G is [formula]-embedded in the product [formula], since dim Y  =  0 and since G, according to (a), is an AE(0)-space, there exists a map g:Y  →  G such that g|f- 1(G)  =  f|f- 1(G).

Next let us denote by

[formula]

and

[formula]

the natural projections onto the corresponding subproducts (C  ⊆  B  ⊆  A). We call a subset B  ⊆  A admissible (compare with the proof of [\cite=chibook96]) if the following equality

[formula]

is true for each point [formula]. We need the following properties of admissible sets.

Claim 1. The union of arbitrary collection of admissible sets is admissible.

Indeed let {Bt:t∈T} be a collection of admissible sets and [formula]. Let [formula]. Clearly [formula] for each t∈T and consequently

[formula]

Obviously, πB(x)∈πB(g(f- 1(x))) and it therefore suffices to show that the set πB(g(f- 1(x))) contains only one point. Assuming that there is a point y∈πB(g(f- 1(x))) such that y  ≠  πB(x) we conclude (having in mind that [formula]) that there must be an index t∈T such that [formula]. But this is impossible

[formula]

Claim 2. If B  ⊆  A is admissible, then the restriction πB|G:G  →  πB(G) is 0-soft.

Let φ:Z  →  πB(G) and φ0:Z0  →  G be two maps defined on a realcompact space Z, with dim Z  =  0, and its closed subset Z0 respectively. Assume that πBφ0  =  φ|Z0 and C(φ0)(C(G))  ⊆  C(Z)|Z0. We wish to construct a map φ:Z  →  G such that φ|Z0  =  φ0 and πBφ  =  φ, i.e. φ makes the diagram

commutative. Since, according to our choice, all Xa's are [formula]-spaces (recall that each Xa is a Polish space), so is the product [formula]. This implies the 0-softness of the projection πB and hence of its restriction

[formula]

Then there exists a map [formula] such that [formula] and [formula]. Since f is 0-invertible (and dim Z  =  0), there exists a map [formula] such that [formula]. Now let [formula]. Since g|f- 1(G)  =  f|f- 1(G), we have φ0  =  φ|Z0. Finally observe that the admissibility of B implies φ  =  πBφ as required.

Claim 3. For each countable subset C  ⊆  A there exists a countable admissible subset B  ⊆  A such that C  ⊆  B.

Since w(Y)  =  τ and dim Y  =  0, it follows (consult [\cite=chibook96]) that Y can be represented as the limit space of a factorizing ω-spectrum SY  =  {YB,qBC, exp ωA} consisting of zero-dimensional Polish spaces YB, B∈ exp ωA, and continuous surjections qBC:YB  →  YC, C  ⊆  B, C,B∈ exp ωA. Consider also the standard factorizing ω-spectrum [formula] consisting of countable subproducts of the product [formula] and corresponding natural projections. Obviously the full product coincides with the limit of SX. One more factorizing ω-spectrum arises naturally. This is the spectrum SG  =  {πB(G),πBC|πB(G), exp ωA} the limit of which coincides with G.

Consider the map f: lim SY  →   lim SX. By [\cite=chibook96], there is a cofinal and ω-closed subset Tf of exp ωA such that for each B∈Tf there is a map [formula] such that [formula]. Moreover, these maps form a morphism

[formula]

limit of which coincides with f. Since f is proper and functionally closed, we may assume (see [\cite=chibook96]) without loss of generality (considering a smaller cofinal and ω-subset of Tf if necessary) that the above indicated morphism is bicommutative. This simply means that [formula] for any B∈Tf and any closed subset K of the product [formula].

Similarly, applying [\cite=chibook96] to the map g: lim SY  →   lim SG, we obtain a cofinal and ω-closed subset Tg of exp ωA and the associated to it morphism

[formula]

limit of which coincides with the map g.

By Proposition [\ref=P:3.1.1], the intersection [formula] is still a cofinal and ω-closed subset of exp ωA. It therefore suffices to show that each B∈T is an admissible subset of A. Consider a point [formula]. First observe that the bicommutativity of the morphism associated with Tf implies that qB(f- 1(x))  =  f- 1B(πB(x)). Since the maps fB and gB coincide on f- 1B(πB(G)) we have

[formula]

as required.

Claim 4. If C and B are admissible subsets of A and C  ⊆  B, then the map πBC|πB(G):πB(G)  →  πC(G) is 0-soft.

This property follows from Claim 2 and [\cite=chibook96].

After having all the needed properties of admissible subsets established we proceed as follows. Since |A|  =  τ we can write A  =  {aα:α  <  τ}. By Claim 3, each aα∈A is contained in a countable admissible subset Bα  ⊆  A. Let [formula]. We use these sets to define a transfinite inverse spectrum S  =  {Gα,pα + 1α,τ} as follows. Let Gα  =  πAα(G) and pα + 1α  =  πAα + 1Aα|Gα + 1 for each α  <  τ. All the required properties of the spectrum SG are satisfied by construction.

The implication (b) [formula] (a) immediately follows from [\cite=chibook96]

Actually 0-soft homomorphism pα + 1α:Gα + 1  →  Gα, α  <  τ, in Theorem [\ref=T:ae0](b)1 has Polish kernel in a somewhat stonger sense than the original definition presented in Subsection [\ref=SS:aen]. Namely a Polish space P (from the definition), such that Gα + 1 admist a C-embedding into the product Gα  ×  P in such a way that pα + 1α coincides with the restriction of the projection πGα:Gα  ×  P  →  Gα, can be chosen to be a Polish group and the embedding of Gα + 1  →  Gα  ×  P can be assumed to be a homomorphism. Of course this implies that ker pα + 1α, as a closed subgroup of P, is itself a Polish group. It would be interesting to see whether the converse of this observation is also true, i.e. is it true that if the kernel ker p of a 0-soft homomorphism p:G  →  L of [formula]-groups is Polish, then p has a Polish kernel in the sense of Subsection [\ref=SS:aen].

Next we characterize 0-soft homomorphisms of [formula]-groups with Polish kernels.

By Proposition [\ref=P:B8.2.1], we may assume, without loss of generality, that both G and L are topologically and algebraically isomorphic to the limits of factorizing ω-spectra SG  =  {Gα,pβα,A} and SL  =  {Lα,qβα,A}, consisting of Polish groups and 0-soft limit homomorphisms. By [\cite=chibook96], we may also assume that the map f is the limit of a morphism {fα:Gα  →  Lα;A}, consisting of continuous maps fα:Gα  →  Lα. Since f itself and all the limit projections pα:G  →  Gα and qα:L  →  Lα are homomorphisms between respective groups, it follows easily that fα:Gα  →  Lα is also a homomorphism, α∈A. Finally since f is 0-soft and has a Polish kernel, it follows, by [\cite=chibook96], that all limit square diagrams

[formula]

generated by limit projections of spectra SG and SL, by elements of the morphism {fα} and by the map f, are the Cartesian squares.

Below, in Subsection [\ref=SS:universal], we consider actions of [formula]-groups on [formula]-spaces. Main tool here is the following statement (see [\cite=chibook96]).

Applications

Universal [formula]-groups and universal actions of [formula]-groups

In this Subsection we prove the existence of universal [formula]-groups of a given weight as well as the existence of a universal action of a [formula]-group of a given weight on a compact [formula]-space of the same weight.

Let G be a [formula]-group of weight τ. By Corollary [\ref=C:emb], G is topologically and algebraically isomorphic to a closed and C-embedded subgroup of the product [formula], where Gt is a Polish group for each t∈T and |T|  =  τ. By Uspenskii's theorem [\cite=usp86], Gt can be identified with a closed subgroup of [formula]. Obviously [formula], and consequently G, is a closed and C-embedded subgroup of [formula].

Let τ  >  ω. Clearly the [formula]-group [formula] (i.e. the τ-th power of the group [formula]) continuously acts on the Tychonov cube [formula] via the natural action ("coordinatewise evaluation")

[formula]

which is defined by letting

[formula]

Let τ  >  ω. The action [formula] is universal in the category of actions of [formula]-groups of weight τ on compact [formula]-spaces of weight τ. More formally, let λ:G  ×  X  →  X be a continuous action of a [formula]-group G of weight τ on a compact [formula]-space X of weight τ. Then there exists a topological and algebraic embedding [formula] with a closed image and an embedding [formula] such that the following diagram

[formula]

commutes.

By Proposition [\ref=P:B8.2.1], G can be represented as the limit of a factorizing ω-spectrum SG  =  {Gα,sβα,A} consisting of Polish groups and 0-soft limit homomorphisms. Similarly, by [\cite=chibook96], X can be represented as the limit space of a factorizing ω-spectrum SX  =  {Xα,pβα,A} consisting of metrizable compacta and 0-soft limit projections. Without loss of generality we may assume that these spectra SG and SX have the same indexing set A and |A|  =  τ. By Proposition [\ref=P:action], the given action λ:G  ×  X  →  X is the limit of level actions, i.e. λ  =   lim λα, where

[formula]

is a morphism between the spectra SG|B  ×  SX|B and SX|B and B is a cofinal and ω-closed subset of the indexing set A. We may also assume that |B|  =  τ.

Since G  =   lim SG|B it follows that the diagonal product

[formula]

is a topological and algebraic isomorphism with a closed image. Similarly the diagonal product

[formula]

is an embedding. Consider also the product action

[formula]

defined by letting

[formula]

Note that [formula], i.e. the following diagram

[formula]

is commutative.

Since for each α∈B the group Gα is Polish, it follows by [\cite=megr96] (see also [\cite=bekech96]) that there exist a topological and algebraic embedding [formula] with a closed image and an embedding [formula] (here [formula] denotes a copy of the Hilbert cube [formula]) such that [formula]. This simply means that the diagram

[formula]

commutes for each α∈B. Here [formula] is the evaluation action, i.e. [formula] for each [formula]. Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

Finally consider the commutative diagram

[formula]

and note that since |B|  =  τ the upper horizontal arrow is actually the action [formula]. Clearly it suffices to let [formula] and [formula]. This completes the proof.

It would be very interesting to prove that for a [formula]-group G of weight τ  >  ω the category of AE(0)-spaces (of weight τ) admitting actions of the group G and their G-maps contains a universal object. For τ  =  ω this fact has recently been proved in [\cite=hjo99].

Closed subgroups of powers of the symmetric group S∞

The following result gives an embeddability criterion into the symmetric group S∞ - the group of all bijections of [formula] under the relative topology inherited from [formula]. It is important to note [\cite=dough94] that there exist zero-dimensional Polish groups which can not be embedded into S∞ as closed subgroups.

Let G be a Polish group. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

G is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of S∞;

G admits a (countable) neighborhood basis at the identity consisting of open subgroups;

G admits a (countable) basis closed under left multiplication (or a countable basis closed under right multiplication);

G admits a compatible left-invariant ultrametric.

Next we characterize those topological AE(0)-groups which are isomorphic to closed subgroups of infinite powers Sτ∞, τ  ≥  ω, of S∞.

Let τ  ≥  1 be a cardinal number. The following conditions are equivalent for any topological AE(0)-group G of weight τ  ≥  ω:

G is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of Sτ∞;

G admits a neighborhood basis at the identity consisting of open subgroups.

If τ  =  1 our statement coincides with Theorem [\ref=T:beke]. Next consider the case 1  <  τ  ≤  ω. It is easy to see that the group Sτω admits a countable neighborhood basis at the identity consisting of open subgroups. Obviously every closed subgroup of Sωτ has the same property (and, consequently, by Theorem [\ref=T:beke], can be embedded into S∞). Conversely if a Polish group G admits a countable neighborhood basis at the identity consisting of open subgroups, then, by Theorem [\ref=T:beke], G is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of S∞. It only remains to note that G∞ is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of Sτ∞ for any τ.

Next we assume that τ  >  ω. By [\cite=chibook96], G is isomorphic to the limit space of a factorizing ω-spectrum SG  =  {Gα,pβα,A} all spaces Gα, α∈A, of which are Polish groups and all limit projections pα:G  →  Gα, α∈A, of which are 0-soft homomorphisms.

Now consider the following relation L∈A2:

[formula]

Let us verify conditions of Proposition [\ref=P:search].

Existence. For each α∈A we need to find β∈A such that (α,β)∈L. Let Vα be a countable neighborhood basis at eα∈Gα which contains intersections of its finite subcollections. For each V∈Vα the set [formula] is a neighborhood of the identity e∈G. By (ii), there exists an open subgroup UV of G such that [formula]. Since every open subgroup in G is closed, it follows that UV, as an open and closed subset of G, is a functionally open in G. Recall that the spectrum SG is factorizing and consequently there exist an index βV∈A and an open subset UβVV  ⊆  GβV such that βV  ≥  α and [formula]. By Corollary [\ref=C:3.1.2], there exists an index β∈A such that β  ≥  βV for each V∈Vα. Let [formula], V∈Vα. Note that

[formula]

Since the limit projection pβ:G  →  Gβ is a homomorphism it follows that Uβ,αV  =  pβ(UV) is a subgroup of Gβ. Finally since UβVV is open in GβV, we conclude that [formula] is open in Gβ. This shows that (α,β)∈L.

Majorantness. If (α,β)∈L and γ  ≥  β, then (α,γ)∈L. Since (α,β)∈L it follows that for each V∈Vα there exists an open subgroup Uβ,αV of Gβ such that [formula] where Vα is a countable neighborhood basis at the identity eα∈Gα containing intersections of its finite subcollections. Let [formula] for each V∈Vα. Since the projection pγβ:Gγ  →  Gβ is a continuous homomorphism, it follows that Uγ,αV is an open subgroup of Gγ. Obviously

[formula]

which shows that (α,γ)∈L as required.

ω-closeness. Let {αi:i∈ω} be a countable chain in A and (αi,β)∈L for some β∈A and each i∈ω. We need to show that (α,β)∈L where α  =   sup {αi:i∈ω}.

Let Vαi be a countable neighborhood basis at eαi∈Gαi and Uβ,αiV, V∈Vαi, be an open subgroup of Gβ witnessing the fact that (αi,β)∈L.

Consider the collection

[formula]

Since the spectrum SG is an ω-spectrum and since α  =   sup {αi:i∈ω} it follows that Vα forms a neighborhood basis at eα∈Gα. For each [formula] choose V∈Vαi such that [formula] and let [formula]. Since (αi,β)∈L, we have

[formula]

This proves that (α,β)∈L.

According to Proposition [\ref=P:search] the set [formula] of L-reflexive elements is cofinal and ω-closed in A. The L-reflexivity of an element α∈A means precisely that there exists a countable neighborhood basis Vα at eα∈Gα containing intersections of its finite subcollections and such that for each V∈Vα there exists an open subgroup UαV  ⊆  Gα with UαV  ⊆  V. This obviously means that for each [formula] the Polish group Gα satisfies condition (ii) of Theorem [\ref=T:beke]. Consequently, by Theorem [\ref=T:beke], Gα is topologically isomorphic to a closed subgroup of S∞. Next note that since [formula] is cofinal in A the limit space of the spectrum [formula] is topologically isomorphic to G. This obviously implies that G is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of the product [formula], which in turn is topologically isomorphic to a closed subgroup of Sτ∞ (note that [formula]). This completes the proof of implication (ii) [formula] (i).

Verification of the implication (i) [formula] (ii) is trivial. Proof is completed.

Let τ  ≥  2. The following conditions are equivalent for any Polish group G:

G is topologically isomorphic to a closed subgroup of S∞;

G is topologically isomorphic to a closed subgroup of Sτ∞.

There exists a zero-dimensional Polish group which is not topologically isomorphic to a closed subgroup of Sτ∞ for any cardinal number τ.

It is known [\cite=dough94] that there exists a zero-dimensional Polish group G which is not topologically isomorphic to a closed subgroup of S∞. By Corollary [\ref=C:doug], G can not be topologically isomorphic to a closed subgroup of Sτ∞ for any cardinal τ  ≥  2.

Baire isomorphisms

The main result of this Subsection (Theorem [\ref=T:baire]) allows us to reduce in many instances (descriptive) set theoretical considerations of general [formula]-groups to those for Polish groups.

Let f:X  →  Y be a 0-soft homomorphism between [formula]-groups. Then there exists a Baire isomorphism h:Y  ×   ker f  →  X such that [formula], where πY:Y  ×   ker f  →  Y stands for the projection onto the first coordinate.

By Proposition [\ref=P:bb], there exists a Baire map g:Y  →  X such that [formula]. The required Baire isomorphism h:Y  ×   ker f  →  X (not a homomorphism unless g is a homomorphism itself) can now be defined by letting

[formula]

where ·   denotes the multiplication operation in X.

Every [formula]-group is Baire isomorphic to the product of Polish groups.

Let X be a [formula]-group. If w(X)  =  ω, then X itself is Polish and there is nothing to prove.

Let now w(X)  =  τ  >  ω. According to Theorem [\ref=T:ae0], X is topologically and algebraically isomorphic to the limit of a well-ordered continuous spectrum SX  =  {Xα,pα + 1α,τ} such that X0 is a Polish group and the 0-soft homomorphism pα + 1α:Xα + 1  →  Xα has a Polish kernel for each α  <  τ.

Our goal is to prove that X is Baire isomorphic to the product [formula]. We proceed by induction. By Lemma [\ref=L:dixmier], there exists a Baire isomorphism h1:X0  ×   ker p10  →  X1 such that [formula]. Suppose that for each α, where 1  ≤  α  <  β  <  τ, we have already constructed Baire isomorphism [formula] in such a way that

If α  +  1  <  β, then

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the natural projection.

hα  =   lim {hγ:γ  <  α}, whenever α  <  β is a limit ordinal number.

We now construct Baire isomorphism [formula]

If β is a limit ordinal number, then we let hβ  =   lim {hα:α  <  β}.

If β  =  α + 1, then consider the following commutative diagram

[formula]

where

[formula] stands for the identity map;

[formula]

denotes the projection onto the first coordinate and

h:Xα  ×   ker pα + 1α  →  Xα + 1 is a Baire isomorphism existence of which is guaranteed by Lemma [\ref=L:dixmier].

The required Baire isomorphism [formula] can now be defined as the composition [formula]. This completes induction and finishes the construction of Baire isomorphisms hα, α  <  τ. It is now easy to see that

[formula]

is the required Baire isomorphism. Note here that X0 as well as ker pα + 1α, α  <  τ, are Polish groups. Proof is completed.
