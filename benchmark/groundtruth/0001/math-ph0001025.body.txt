CONTINUATION OF DIRECT PRODUCTS OF DISTRIBUTIONS

A. Peterman Theoretical Physics Division, CERN CH - 1211 Geneva 23

If, in some problems, one has to deal with the "product" of distributions fi (also called generalized functions) [formula], this product has a priori no definite meaning as a functional [formula] for φ∈S. But if xκ + 1Πmi = 1fi exists, whatever the associativity is between some powers ri of x ([formula]) and the various fi, then a continuation of the linear functional [formula] from M onto S(N) for some N is shown to exist in such a way that [formula] is defined unambiguously, and [formula], significant, though not unique.

Existence

In the sense of convergence in the space S* (distributions),

[formula]

with Fyκ(x)  =  f+κ(x + iy)  -  f-κ(x  -  iy), [formula] are holomorphic in tabular domains TC±R and satisfy

[formula]

and

[formula]

α,β  ≥  0, independent of [formula] and [formula]. From this, it follows that there exists in S* a unique boundary value

[formula]

Let us suppose that for arbitrary φ∈S there exists a finite limit

[formula]

independent of the sequence y  →  0,  y∈C+. Then, since the space S* is dense, this limit defines a distribution in S* which we call the product [formula] of the distributions [formula]. Thus

[formula]

if the limit of the RHS exists and is independent of the sequence y  →  0,y∈C+. This product is obviously commutative and associative. So the set of boundary values that are holomorphic in TC+R and satisfy (1) constitute a commutative ring with unity, without zero divisors with respect to the multiplication defined above.

We note that the existence of the lim in (2) for φ∈S implies the existence of the limit in (3) with respect to the norm of the functional in S(N) * for some N, which depends on [formula] (notice that weak convergence in S* implies strong convergence).

General case

Suppose now that (2) does not exist for all φ∈S, but that it exists for all φ in a closed subspace M of S(N) for some N. (Since M is closed in S(N) it is a Banach space with norm [formula]). From the Banach-Steinhaus theorem, (2) defines a continuous linear functional [formula] on M. We use now the term 'product' [formula] of the distributions [formula] for any continuous linear functional in the space S(N) *  ⊂  S* that is a continuation of [formula] from M to S(N). According to the Hahn-Banach theorem, such an extension always exists but is not unique in general.

We shall concentrate now on the case of those φ in S(N) that vanish together with all derivatives of order p  ≤  N inclusively, at x = 0. In this case, all continuations [formula] of [formula] from M onto S(N) are given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

and ω(x) is an arbitrary function, ω∈S, identically equal to 1 in a neighbourhood of the point x = 0; the cκ are arbitrary constants. (Notice that the extension (4) is actually independent of ω(x)).

In conclusion, the formula (4) represents the desired result, given at the end of the preamble with [formula] the general solution of [formula] and [formula], a particular solution of [formula].

It is therefore shown that the solution (4) is not unique, the cκ being arbitrary constants.
