A Computation of The Mass Spectrum of Mesons and Baryons

Introduction

In this paper we give a computation of the mass spectrum of mesons and baryons. We show that there is a consecutive numbering of the mass spectrum of mesons and baryons. Also we show that in this numbering many stable mesons and baryons are assigned with a prime number.

We first consider the mesons listed in the Particle Data Group (PDA)[\cite=PDA]. Let us start with the π meson. Let us choose 45 as a rate. Then we have 3  ×  45 = 135 which gives the mass 135Mev of the π0 meson. We notice that 3 is a prime number and we assigned it to the π0 meson. Then we consider the koan mesons. We have that 11  ×  45 = 495. This approximates well the experimental mass 493.7Mev of the K+ and the K- mesons. We notice that 11 is a prime number and we assign it to the koan mesons. Let us then consider the η meson. We have 13  ×  45 = 585 which approximates quite well the experimental mass 548.8Mev of the η meson. Here let us make a more precise estimate of the mass of η meson. Let 45 be deviated by 3 to 42. This deviation may be considered as due to the effect of spin and orbital angular momentum for mass splitting. Then we have 13  ×  42 = 546 which approximates well the experimental mass 548.8Mev of the η meson. We have that 13 is a prime number and we assign it to the η meson. This then gives the mass spectrum of the first Eightfold Way of mesons. We shall later consider the [formula] meson of the first nonet.

Let us then consider the next octet of vector mesons. Let us first consider the ρ meson. We have 17  ×  45 = 765. This approximates the experimental mass 770Mev of the ρ0 meson. Let us then consider the ω meson. Let 45 be deviated by 1 to 46. As above this deviation may be considered as due to the effect of spin and orbital angular momentum for mass splitting. Then we have 17  ×  46  =  782. This approximates well the experimental mass 783Mev of the ω meson. We notice that both the ρ0 meson and the ω meson correspond to the same prime number 17. Let us then consider the K*(892) meson. We have 19  ×  45 = 852. This approximates quite well the experimental mass 892Mev of the K*(892) meson. Here let us make a more precise estimate of the K* mesons. Let 45 be deviated by 2 to 47. Then we have 19  ×  47 = 890. This approximates well the experimental mass 892Mev of the K*(892) meson. we have that the K*(892) meson correspond to the prime number 19. Let us then consider the φ meson. We have 23  ×  45 = 1035. This approximates well the experimental mass 1020Mev of the φ meson. We notice that 23 is a prime number and we assign it to the φ meson. This thus gives the mass spectrum of the nonet of vector mesons.

Let us then consider the [formula] meson of the first nonet. Let 45 be deviated by 3 to 42. Then we have 23  ×  42 = 966. This approximates well the experimental mass 958Mev of the [formula] meson. This thus gives the mass spectrum of the first nonet of mesons.

We notice that these two nonets are finally numbered at the prime number 23. This is interesting because the next prime number is 29 which is relatively far apart from the prime number 23. We also notice that the consecutive prime numbers 11,13,17,19 and 23 have all been assigned to the mesons of the first two nonets of mesons which are stable mesons.

The φ meson is considered as a meson of the form [formula] where s denotes the strange quark. Then it is interesting to note that both the mesons φ and η' correspond to the prime number 23. This shows that there is a relation between these two mesons. This agrees with the usual quark content of these two mesons that these two mesons are considered to have a component of [formula]. Later we show that the mesons a0(980) and f0(980) also correspond to the prime number 23. From this we may conclude that these two mesons a0(980) and f0(980) should also relate to [formula]. This agrees with the experiments that these two mesons lie very close to the opening of the [formula] channel [\cite=Abe]-[\cite=Kam].

Let us then considered the J / ψ meson [formula] for the charm quark c. We have 67  ×  46 = 3082. This approximetes quite well the experimental mass 3096Mev of the J / ψ meson. Thus J / ψ is assigned with the prime number 67.

Let us consider more on the J / ψ meson. For the J / ψ meson let us choose 23  ×  45 as another rate. Then we have 3  ×  23  ×  45 = 3105. This approximates well the experimental mass 3096Mev of the J / ψ meson. Thus the prime number 3 also corresponds to the J / ψ meson which is a stable meson. We notice that 23  ×  45Mev = 1035Mev is just the mass for the φ meson. This gives a relation between the strange quark and the charm quark.

Let us then consider the Υ meson which is of the form [formula] where b denotes the beauty (or bottom) quark. We have 211  ×  45 = 9495. This approximates quite well the experimental mass 9460Mev of the Υ meson. We also notice that 211 is a prime number. Then let us consider the Υ(10023) meson which is the first excite state of the Υ meson. We have 223  ×  45 = 10035. This approximates well the experimental mass 10023Mev of the [formula] meson. It is interesting to notice that 223 is also a prime number and that it is the prime number next to the prime number 211 for the Υ meson.

Let us consider two more excited states Υ(10350) and Υ(10570) of the Υ meson. We have [formula] and 235  ×  45 = 10575. This approximete well the experimental masses of Υ(10350) and Υ(10570) respectively. However we notice that 230 and 235 are not prime numbers.

Thus we see that all the basic mesons except the meson [formula] for the top quark t correspond to a prime number. For the meson [formula] because its mass is very large that we need a more accurate measurement of the value of its mass to determine the prime number for this meson [formula]. We have 7993  ×  45 = 359685 which approximately gives 360Gev of the experimental mass of [formula]. Then the prime number 7993 could be approximately for [formula].

Continuing in this way with 45 or its deviations as a rate we have that all the experimental masses of mesons in the table of mesons can well be approximated by this computation. For simplicity we list the computational result in a form of table. In this table we list together the light mesons and strange mesons which are separately listed in the Particle Data Group (PDA) [\cite=PDA]. In this table in the column of computed mass the first number of the product is as a consecutive number while the second number is as a deviation from the number 45. In this table the prime consecutive numbers are in bold face. From this table we see that there are more mesons which could be corresponded to a prime consecutive number. This is an evidence that prime numbers give more stable mesons than nonprime numbers. Also it is interesting to notice that the consecutive numbers from 26 to 53 have all been assigned to the mesons.

In this table of mesons for the mesons a0(980) and f0(980) we have 23  ×  43 = 989. This approximates quite well the experimental mass 980Mev of a0(980) and f0(980). Thus the prime number 23 is also assigned to a0(980) and f0(980). By the same reason as for the η' meson we have that a0(980) and f0(980) are related to φ and their quark contents sould have a component of [formula]. This agrees with the experiments of these two mesons [\cite=Abe]-[\cite=Kam].

Let us then consider the mass spectrum of baryons. In contrast to the rate 45 for mesons let us choose 72 as the rate for baryons.

Let us start from the the neutron n = N(939). We have 13  ×  72 = 936. This approximates well the experimental mass 939Mev of the neutron n = N(939). We have that the prime number 13 is assigened to proton and neutron. Then we consider Λ(1115). Let 72 be deviated to 66. Then we have 17  ×  66 = 1122. This approximates well the experimental mass 1115Mev of Λ(1115). We have that the prime number 17 is assigned to Λ(1115). Then we consider Σ(1193). We have 17  ×  70 = 1190 where 70 is as a deviation of 72. This approximates well the experimental mass 1193Mev of Σ(1193). Thus the prime number 17 is also assigned to Σ(1193). Then we consider Ξ(1317). We have 19  ×  69 = 1311 where 69 is as a deviation of 72. This approximates well the experimental mass 1317Mev of Ξ(1317). The prime number 19 is assigned to Ξ(1317). This gives the mass spectrum of the first Eightfold Way of baryons.

Let us then consider the first decuplet of baryons. Consider first Δ(1232). We have 17  ×  72 = 1224. This approximates well the experimental mass 1232Mev of Δ(1232). The prime number 17 is assigned to Δ(1232). Then we consider Σ(1385). We have 19  ×  73 = 1387 where 73 is as a deviation of 72. This approximates well the experimental mass 1385Mev of Σ(1385). The prime number 19 is then assigned to Σ(1385). Then we consider Ξ(1530). Let 72 be deviated by 1 to 73. Then we have 21  ×  73 = 1533. This approximates well the experimental mass 1530Mev of Ξ(1530). The number 21 is assigned to Ξ(1530). (On the other hand we also have 19  ×  81 = 1539 which also approximates 1530 well. Thus the prime number 19 may also be assigned to Ξ(1530). However 81 is a larger deviation from 72 than 73). Finally we consider Ω(1672). Let 72 be deviated by 1 to 73. Then we have 73  ×  23 = 1679. This approximates well the experimental mass 1672Mev of Ω(1672). Thus the prime number 23 is assigned to Ω(1672). This gives the mass spectrum of the first decuplet of baryons.

It is interesting to notice that as the φ meson we have that the Ω(1672) baryon also corresponds to the prime number 23. Also the second octet of vector mesons and the first decuplet of baryons are both assigned with prime numbers 17,19 and 23. This shows that the second octet of mesons corresponds to the first decuplet of baryons.

Continuing in this way we have that all the experimental masses of baryons in the table of baryons in the Particle Data Group (PDA) can well be approximated by this computation. For simplicity we list the computational result in a form of table. In this table in the column of computed mass the first number of the product is as a consecutive number. Also the prime consecutive numbers are in bold face.

To conclude, we have given a computation of the mass spectrum of mesons and baryons. From the above tables we see that our computation can approximate the experimental masses of mesons and baryons. From this computation we show that there is a consecutive numbering of the mass spectrum of mesons and baryons and it is interesting that in this numbering many stable mesons and baryons are assigned with a prime number. In addition to the Regge theory and the constitutent quark model (CQM)[\cite=Col][\cite=Lan][\cite=Clo] this computational method may provide a way to the study of the mass spectrum of mesons and baryons. We shall give a model of mesons and baryons from which this computation is based on. In this model each meson or baryon will be considered as a knot.
