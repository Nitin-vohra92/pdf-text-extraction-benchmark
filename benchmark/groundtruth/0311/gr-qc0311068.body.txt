Introduction

The idea of extra dimensions has a long and honourable history that goes back to the works of Nordström, Kaluza and Klein [\cite=Nordstrom1914] - [\cite=Klein1926]. Since that time Kaluza-Klein-type theories in five or more dimensions have been used and reemerged over the years in several contexts.

In gauge theories they have been employed in the quest for unification of the fundamental interactions in physics. In this case the major idea is that the various interactions in nature might be unified by enlarging the dimensionality of the space-time. Kaluza and Klein themselves studied how one could unify Einstein's theory of gravitation and Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism in a five-dimensional (5-D) framework. The higher-dimensional Kaluza-Klein approach was later used, especially among those investigating the eleven-dimensional (11-D) supergravity and ten-dimensional (10-D) superstrings.

Recent developments in string theory and its extension M-theory have suggested an alternative scenario in which the matter fields are confined on 3-D brane-world embedded in 1 + 3 + d dimensions (the bulk). It is not necessary for the d extra spatial dimensions to be small and compact; and only gravity and other exotic matter such as the dilaton can propagate in the bulk. This general picture can be simplified to a 5-D context where matter fields are restricted to a 4-D space-time while gravity acts in 5-D [\cite=recent] [\cite=old]. In this limited 5-D framework most work in brane-world cosmology has been done (see, for example, [\cite=BraxBruck2003] [\cite=Langlois2003] and references therein).

A systematic and independent approach to the 5-D non-compact Kaluza-Klein scenario, known as space-time-matter theory (STM), has also been discussed in a number of papers (see, e.g., [\cite=WessonLeon1992] - [\cite=Wesson1999] and references therein; and also [\cite=PRT] - [\cite=CRT] ). More recently the equivalence between STM and brane-world theories has been discussed [\cite=Leon2001], and although they have quite different motivation for the introduction of extra dimension they are, in a sense, mathematically equivalent, and solution of STM can be taken over to 5-D brane-world theory (see [\cite=Leon2001] for details).

In 4-D general relativity (GR), it is well known that the curvature tensor can be uniquely decomposed into three irreducible parts, namely the Weyl tensor (denoted by Wabcd), the traceless Ricci tensor ([formula]) and the Ricci scalar ([formula]). The algebraic classification of the Weyl part of the Riemann tensor, known as Petrov classification, has played a significant role in the study of various topics in GR. However, for full classification of curvature tensor of nonvacuum space-times one also has to consider the Ricci part of the curvature tensor, which by virtue of Einstein's equations Gab  =  κ  Tab  +  Λ  gab   clearly has the same algebraic classification of both the Einstein tensor [formula] and the energy momentum tensor Tab.

The Petrov classification [\cite=petrov] has played an important role in the investigation of various issues in general relativity [\cite=ksmh]. The algebraic classification of the Ricci part Sab, known as Segre classification, has been discussed by several authors [\cite=Hall] and is of great importance in three contexts. One is in understanding some purely geometrical features of space-times [\cite=ChurcPlebCorHal]. The second one is in classifying and interpreting matter field distributions [\cite=Hall2Hall1FMMRebTeiRebtei1]. The third is as part of the procedure for checking whether apparently different space-times are in fact locally the same up to coordinate transformations [\cite=Cartan] - [\cite=Mac1] (for examples of the use of this invariant characterization in a class of Gödel-type space-times [\cite=RT1983] see [\cite=GTappl]).

In 1995 Santos et al. [\cite=SRT1] studied the algebraic classification of second order symmetric tensors defined on 5-D locally Lorentzian manifolds M. Their analysis is made from first principles, i.e., without using the previous classifications on lower dimensional space-times. However, as concerns the classification itself their approach is by no means straightforward.

In a subsequent paper Hall et al. [\cite=HRST1996] reexamined the algebraic classification of second order symmetric tensor in 5-D space-times under different premises. They have used the knowledge of the algebraic classification of symmetric two-tensors in 4-D space-times as a given starting point, and then shown that the 5-D algebraic classification obtained in [\cite=SRT1] could be achieved in a considerably simpler way. A set of canonical forms for Tab was also presented. In [\cite=HRST1996] they stated with no proof a theorem which collects together a number of important properties of the algebraic structure of the symmetric two-tensors in 5-D. The main goal of the present paper is to offer a detailed proof of that theorem, and to call the attention to the relevance of the algebraic classification of an arbitrary second order symmetric tensor (hereafter denoted by Tab) in the context of 5-D brane-worlds. We also briefly indicate how one can obtain, by induction, the classification of symmetric two-tensors (and the corresponding canonical forms) on n-dimensional (n  >  4) spaces from the classification on 4-dimensional spaces. This is important in the context of 11-D supergravity and 10-D superstrings.

To make this paper as clear and selfcontained as possible, in the next section we introduce the notation that will be used, and present a brief summary of the main results on Segre classification in 5-D obtained in our previous articles [\cite=SRT1] [\cite=HRST1996]. These results are required for section [\ref=mainresults], where we prove two theorems, related to the algebraic structure of a second order symmetric two-tensor T defined in a 5-D locally Lorentzian manifold M.

To close this section we note that the results of this paper apply to any second order real symmetric tensor (such as Einstein, Ricci and energy momentum) defined on 5-D locally Lorentzian manifolds.

Preliminaries

In this section we shall fix our general setting, define the notation and briefly review the main results regarding the classification of a second order symmetric tensor in 5-D, required for the last section.

The algebraic classification of symmetric two-tensors T at a point p∈M can be cast in terms of the eigenvalue problem

[formula]

where λ is a scalar, Vb is a vector and the mixed form Ta b of the tensor T may be thought of as a linear operator T:Tp(M)  →  Tp(M). Throughout this work M is a real 5-dimensional space-time manifold locally endowed with a Lorentzian metric of signature ( -   +    +    +   + ),  Tp(M) denotes the tangent vectorial space at a point p∈M and Latin indices range from 0 to 4, unless otherwise stated. Although the matrix Ta b is real, the eigenvalues λ and the eigenvectors Vb are often complex. A mathematical procedure used to classify matrices in such a case is to reduce them through similarity transformations to canonical forms over the complex field. Among the existing canonical forms the Jordan canonical form (JCF) turns out to be the most appropriate for a classification of Ta b.

A basic result in the theory of JCF is that given an n-square matrix T over the complex field, there exist nonsingular matrices X such that

[formula]

where J, the JCF of T, is a block diagonal matrix, each block being of the form

[formula]

Here r is the dimension of the block and λk is the k-th root of the characteristic equation (T  -  λI) = 0. Hereafter T will be the real matrix formed with the mixed components Ta b of a second order symmetric tensor.

A Jordan matrix J is uniquely defined up to the ordering of the Jordan blocks. Further, regardless of the dimension of a specific Jordan block there is one and only one independent eigenvector associated to it.

In the Jordan classification two square matrices are said to be equivalent if similarity transformations exist such that they can be brought to the same JCF. The JCF of a matrix gives explicitly its eigenvalues and makes apparent the dimensions of the Jordan blocks. However, for many purposes a somehow coarser classification of a matrix is sufficient. In the Segre classification, for example, the value of the roots of the characteristic equation is not relevant -- only the dimension of the Jordan blocks and the degeneracies of the eigenvalues matter. The Segre type is a list [formula] of the dimensions of the Jordan blocks. Equal eigenvalues in distinct blocks are indicated by enclosing the corresponding digits inside round brackets. Thus, for example, in the degenerated Segre type {(31)1} four out of the five eigenvalues are equal; there are three linearly independent eigenvectors, two of which are associated to Jordan blocks of dimensions 3 and 1, and the last eigenvector corresponds to a block of dimension 1.

In classifying symmetric tensors in a Lorentzian space two refinements to the usual Segre notation are often used. Instead of a digit to denote the dimension of a block with complex eigenvalue a letter is used, and the digit corresponding to a timelike eigenvector is separated from the others by a comma.

In this work we shall deal with one type of pentad of vectors, namely the semi-null pentad basis [formula], whose non-vanishing inner products are only

[formula]

At a point p∈M the most general decomposition of Tab in terms of semi-null pentad basis for symmetric tensors at p∈M is manifestly given by [\cite=SRT1]

[formula]

where the coefficients [formula].

We can now present the classification of a symmetric two-tensor in 5-D by recalling the following theorem, proved in [\cite=SRT1] [\cite=HRST1996]:

Let M be a real five-dimensional manifold endowed with a Lorentzian metric g of signature (  -    +    +    +    +  ). Let Ta b be the mixed form of a second order symmetric tensor T defined at any point p∈M. Then Ta b takes one of the following Segre types: {1,1111}, {2111}, {311}, {z    111}, or some degeneracy thereof.

For each Segre type of the Theorem [\ref=Stypes] a semi-null basis with nonvanishing inner products ([\ref=inerp]) can be introduced at p∈M such that Tab as given by ([\ref=Tabgen]) reduces to one of the following canonical forms [\cite=SRT1] [\cite=HRST1996]:

[formula]

and the twenty-two degeneracies thereof. Here [formula] and ρ2    ≠  0 in ([\ref=rabzz111]).

To close this section we recall that the r-dimensional (r  ≥  2) subspaces of Tp(M) can be classified according as they contain more than one, exactly one, or no null independent vectors, and they are respectively called timelike, null and spacelike r-subspaces of Tp(M). Spacelike, null and timelike r-subspaces contain, respectively, only spacelike vectors, null and spacelike vectors, or all types of vectors.

Main Results and Concluding Remarks

In this section we will prove Theorem 4.1 stated in [\cite=HRST1996] without a proof. To make the presentation simpler we have divided it into two theorems: one that deals with eigenvectors of Ta b, and another that treats the invariant subspaces of Ta b.

Let M be a real 5-dimensional manifold endowed with a Lorentzian metric g of signature (  -    +    +    +    +  ). Let Ta b be the mixed form of a second order symmetric tensor T defined at a point p∈M. Then

Ta b has a timelike eigenvector if and only if it is diagonable over [formula] at p.

Ta b has at least three real orthogonal independent eigenvectors at p, two of which (at least) are spacelike.

Ta b has all eigenvalues real at p and is not diagonable if and only if it has an unique null eigendirection at p.

If Ta b has two linearly independent null eigenvectors at p then it is diagonable over [formula] at p and the corresponding eigenvalues are real.

Proof

In the previous section (see also [\cite=SRT1] [\cite=HRST1996]) we have shown that if Ta b admits a timelike vector it is diagonable. Reciprocally, if Ta b is a diagonal real matrix one writes down a general real symmetric matrix gab, uses that gac  Tc b is symmetric and obtains gab  =      (μ1,μ2,μ3,μ4,μ5), where [formula]. As   gab  <  0, then [formula]  ([formula]). As the metric g has signature ( -   +    +    +   + ) one and only one μa is negative. The scalar product on Tp(M) is defined by gab, then the norms of the eigenvectors of Ta b have the same sign as [formula]. Since one μa  <  0, one of the eigenvectors must be timelike.

From ([\ref=rab11111]) - ([\ref=rabzz111]) one can easily find the complete sets of linearly independent eigenvectors and associated eigenvalues for each non-degenerated Segre type. For each type the orthogonality is ensured by ([\ref=inerp]). In Table [\ref=eingeing] we present the eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues for each Segre type. For all types there are at least three orthogonal eigenvectors, two of which are spacelike. We notice that degeneracies between eigenvalues give rise to eigenspaces (subspaces containing only eigenvectors), in which the number of eigendirections increases.

The non-diagonable, non-degenerated Segre types of Ta b are {2111} and {311}. From (ii) we learn that both have only one null eigenvector [formula]. Even when there are degeneracies involving the eigenvalues associated to the null eigenvector for these types we still have only one null direction invariant under Ta b. The converse is clear if one notes that besides the types {2111} and {311} the possible types in which one can have null eigenvectors are the degeneracies of the type {1,1111} involving the eigenvalue associated to the timelike eigenvector. However, even in the simplest degenerated type {(1,1)111} there exist two null independent eigendirections. So, these degenerated types should not be considered.

Let [formula] and [formula] be the two linearly independent null eigenvectors of Ta b at p with respective eigenvalues μ and ν. The symmetry of Tab implies that μ  =  ν. Moreover, [formula] and [formula] are also linearly independent eigenvectors, one of which can easily be shown to be timelike. Therefore, from (i) Ta b is necessarily diagonable.

Let M be a real 5-dimensional manifold endowed with a Lorentzian metric g of signature (  -    +    +    +    +  ). Let Ta b be the mixed form of a second order symmetric tensor T defined at a point p∈M. Then

There always exists a 2-D spacelike subspace of Tp(M) invariant under Ta b.

If a non-null subspace V of Tp(M) is invariant under Ta b, then so is its orthogonal complement [formula].

There always exists a 3-D timelike subspace of Tp(M) invariant under Ta b.

Ta b admits a r-dimensional (r = 2,3,4 ) null invariant subspace N of Tp(M) if and only if Ta b has a null eigenvector, which lies in N.

Proof

Indeed, the spacelike eigenvectors [formula] and [formula] referred to in the item (ii) of the above theorem [\ref=rabtheo1] span a 2-D spacelike subspace of Tp(M) invariant under Ta b.

Let r be the dimension of the non-null subspace V, and i ([formula]) a basis of it. Let [formula] ([formula]) be a basis of [formula]. As V is invariant under Ta b the vectors T  i∈V, and therefore [formula], which together with the symmetry of Tab leads to [formula]. Then for any vector [formula] we have [formula], i.e. [formula] is also invariant under Ta b.

Indeed, from (i) and (ii) it follows that the subspace of Tp(M) spanned by [formula], [formula] and [formula] is invariant under Ta b given in eqs. ([\ref=rab11111]) - ([\ref=rabzz111]).

Clearly every r-dimensional (r = 2,3,4 ) null subspace of Tp(M) can be spanned by a null vector [formula] (say) and a set of r - 1 orthogonal spacelike vectors i such that [formula]. Consider the 2-dimensional invariant null subspace generated by such a pair of basis vectors [formula] and [formula]. Thus

[formula]

where α1  ,α2  ,β1  ,β2∈ and [formula]. Since Tab is symmetric we have xaTa bnb  =  naTa bxb, which together with ([\ref=2null1]) and ([\ref=2null2]) yields α2 = 0, hence [formula] is an eigenvector. The proofs for null subspaces of dimension 3 and 4 are similar. The converse is easy to show. Indeed, from eqs. ([\ref=rab11111]) - ([\ref=rabzz111]) one learns that the Segre types which admit null eigenvectors are {2111}, {311} and their degeneracies, and the type {(1,1)111} and its further degeneracies. Moreover, from eqs. ([\ref=rab11111]) -  ([\ref=rab311]) one finds that for all these Segre types [formula] is an eigenvector and the subspaces of dimension 2, 3 and 4 spanned by [formula], [formula] and [formula], respectively, are null and invariant under Ta b.

Before closing this article we remark that by a similar procedure to that used in the lemma 3.1 of [\cite=HRST1996] one can show that a symmetric two-tensor T defined on an n-dimensional (n  ≥  4) Lorentz space has at least one real spacelike eigenvector. The existence of this eigenvector can be used to reduce, by induction, the classification of symmetric two-tensors on n-dimensional (n  >  4) spaces to the classification (and the corresponding canonical forms) on 4-dimensional spaces, thus recovering in a simpler way the Segre types of symmetric two-tensors on n-dimensions and the corresponding set of canonical forms derived in ref. [\cite=SRT2]. This is important in the context of 11-D supergravity and 10-D superstrings.

Finally we mention that it has sometimes been assumed that the source term (Tab in 4-D) restricted to the brane is a mixture of ordinary matter and a minimally coupled scalar field [\cite=HogenColeyHe2002] [\cite=HoogenIbanez2002], where the gradient of the scalar field [formula] is a timelike vector. In these cases the scalar field can mimic a perfect fluid, i.e., it is of Segre type {1,(111)}. However, according to ref. [\cite=SRT3], depending on the character of the gradient of the scalar field it can also mimic : (i) a null electromagnectic field and pure radiation (Segre type {(211)}, when φa is a null vector); (ii) a tachyon fluid (Segre type {(1,11)1}, when φa is a spacelike vector); and clearly (iii) a Λ term (Segre type {(1,111)}, when the scalar field is a constant).
