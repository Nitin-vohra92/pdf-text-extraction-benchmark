Introduction

Let k be a commutative field and [formula] be a unital k-algebra. We say that [formula] is amenable if for any finite subset [formula] and real number ε > 0 there exists a finite dimensional k- subspace V  ⊂   such that

[formula]

In [\cite=Elek], we saw that the group algebra of an amenable group is amenable, the group algebra of the free group of two generators is non-amenable. Any affine algebra of subexponential growth or any commutative algebra is amenable as well. It is easy to see that amenable algebras satisfy the invariant basis number property. In this paper, we investigate the amenability of skew field extensions. Our main result is the following theorem.

In the course of the proof we shall see that [formula] is an amenable [formula]-algebra if and only if Γ is an amenable group. The corresponding conjecture for general fields remains open.

The Ore-property and amenability

If [formula] is an amenable domain, then it has the left Ore-property that is for any non-zero a,b∈; [formula].

Proof: There exists a finite dimensional subspace W  ⊆   such that [formula] and [formula], hence [formula].

Consequently, if [formula] is an amenable domain, then one can consider its classical ring of quotient [formula], a skew field.

If [formula] is an amenable domain, then [formula] is amenable as well.

Proof: Let [formula], then by the definition of the classical ring of quotient there exists a non-zero element r∈ such that [formula]. By the amenability of [formula] there exists a sequence of finite dimensional k-vector spaces Wn  ⊆  , such that

[formula]

Let Zn  =  {v∈Wn:  xirv∈Wn  }. Then [formula]

Proof: By ([\ref=3e]), for any 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, [formula] Hence if Zin  =  {v∈Wn,  xirv∈Wn}, then [formula] Since [formula], the lemma follows.

Obviously, if Tn  =  {v∈Wn:  rv∈Wn} then [formula] Thus if [formula], then [formula], and [formula]. Now if v∈rSn, then v∈Wn and for any 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, xiv∈Wn, that is rSn  ⊆  Wn and xirSn  ⊆  Wn.

Since [formula], it follows that

[formula]

proving the amenability of [formula].

Notice that by our previous proposition the classical ring of fraction of the Weyl-algebras are amenable. Let us recall the notion of the Gelfand-Kirillov transcendence degree [\cite=GK].

Let D be a skew field extension of the commutative field k. Then

[formula]

where V runs through all the finite dimensional subspaces of D containing the unit.

Note that (D) <   ∞   if and only if there exists a d > 0 with the following property: For any [formula] there exists r∈D such that the affine algebra generated by [formula] has polynomial growth with Gelfand-Kirillov dimension not greater then d.

If D has finite Gelfand-Kirillov transcendence degree then D is amenable.

Proof: We prove that if for any subset [formula] there exists r∈D such that [formula] generate an amenable domain, then D is amenable. Indeed, if

[formula]

then

[formula]

where Vn = rWn. Thus D is in fact amenable.

Note however, that Aizenbud proved in [\cite=Aiz] that for some poly-cyclic groups Γ the classical ring of quotient of the group algebra k(Γ) has infinite Gelfand-Kirillov transcendence degree. Since such groups are amenable, these finitely generated skew fields above are amenable as well.

Also, since all affine commutative algebras and all matrix algebras over such algebras are of polynomial growth, we have the following corollary:

If k  ⊆  L is finite dimensional over its center, then L is amenable.

The class of amenable skew fields are closed under some operations:

Proof: The parts (a) and (b) are easy exercises, for (c), let us consider the amenable k-algebras A and B. It is enough to prove that if [formula], [formula] then there exists a sequence of finite dimensional subspaces [formula] such that

[formula]

Let {Wn}  ⊆  A,{Zn}  ⊆  B be sequences of finite dimensional subspaces such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Set [formula]. Then

[formula]

hence the proposition follows.

Non-amenable subskewfields

Let k  ⊆  D  ⊆  E be skewfields. Suppose that D is non-amenable, then E is non-amenable as well.

Proof: If D is non-amenable, then there exists α > 1 and [formula] such that for any finite dimensional k-subspace W  ⊆  D

[formula]

It is enough to prove that for any m  ≥  1 and any finite dimensional k-subspace Z of the m-dimensional left D-module [formula]

[formula]

We proceed by induction. The m = 1 case is just ([\ref=e81]). Suppose that ([\ref=e82]) holds for [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula] the projection onto the last coordinate. If  dimk(πn + 1(Z)) =  dimk(Z), then

[formula]

If  dimk(πn + 1(Z)) <  dimk(Z), then [formula] as k-subspaces, where [formula] and  dimk(πn + 1(Z)) =  dimk(Z2). Let [formula] be a k-basis for Z1 and let [formula] be a k-basis for Z2. Let G be the k-vectorspace generated by [formula]. Then by the inductional hypothesis, there exists elements

[formula]

[formula]

such that t1  ≥  α  s1, t2  ≥  α  s2 and :

[formula]

and

[formula]

are both independent system of vectors in [formula] resp. [formula].

Then [formula] form an independent system of more than α  ·   dimk(Z) elements, proving ([\ref=e82]) for the subspace [formula]

The construction of a non-amenable skew field

Let Γ be a discrete group and V be a vectorspace over k. A representation φ:Γ  →  GL(V) is called algebrically amenable, if for any [formula] and ε > 0 there exists a finite dimensional vectorspace W  ⊆  V such that

[formula]

Note that if [formula] is an amenable k-algebra, then the group of invertible elements of [formula] acts on [formula] in an algebrically amenable fashion. We should observe that the group of non-zero elements of an amenable skew field can be in fact a non-amenable group. As a matter of fact it is Lichtman's conjecture that any skew field which is infinite dimensional over its center contains a free group of two generators. By the result of Makar-Limanov [\cite=Mak] the first Weyl skew field contains even a free group algebra as a subalgebra.

Let Γ be a countable group represented by unitary transformations on a Hilbert-space [formula]. If the representation is algebraically amenable, then it is amenable in the sense of Bekka [\cite=Bek] that is there exists a linear map [formula] from the space of bounded linear operators to the complex numbers such that τ(Id) = 1 and

[formula]

for any A∈B(), g∈G.

Proof: By our assumption, there exists a sequence of finite dimensional subspaces Wn  ⊆  ,  n  ≥  1 such that for any g∈Γ:

[formula]

Let Pn denote the orthogonal projection onto Wn. Then for any A∈B(),

[formula]

is a sequence of complex number bounded by the norm of A. Hence one can consider

[formula]

where ω is an ultrafilter on the natural numbers and lim ω is the corresponding ultralimit. Then the map [formula] is clearly bounded and linear. In order to prove that τ(A) = τ(gAg- 1) it is enough to see that for any g∈Γ and A∈B():

[formula]

Let [formula]. Then [formula] and both Gn and gGn are subspaces of Wn. Pick an orthonormal basis [formula] for Gn and extent it to an orthonormal basis for the whole Wn by adding [formula], where [formula].

Let gn be a unitary transformation on Wn such that gn|Gn = g. Define gn to be the identity transformation on [formula]. Then:

[formula]

Indeed, gn commutes with Pn, hence

[formula]

and

[formula]

by the property of the trace.

[formula]

Proof: Note that:

[formula]

[formula]

Similarly,

[formula]

Since gn(vi) = g(vi) we have the following estimate:

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore the lemma follows from the fact that

[formula]

Consequently, by the Lemma [\ref=12l] and ([\ref=e12]) we can see that τ(A) = τ(g- 1Ag).

If Γ is a countable group, then [formula] is amenable as a [formula]-algebra if and only if Γ is an amenable group. Moreover Γ acts on l2(Γ) in an algebrically amenable fashion.

Proof: If Γ amenable then k(Γ) is amenable for any field k [\cite=Elek]. Now, let us suppose that Γ is non-amenable. If [formula] were amenable, then the natural representation of Γ on [formula] would be algebrically amenable. Therefore the natural representation of Γ by translations on the Hilbert-space [formula] must be algebrically amenable as well. By our previous proposition, there exists a bounded linear functional [formula] such that τ(A) = τ(g- 1Ag)  , for any A∈B(), g∈Γ. Consider the commutative C*-algebra l∞(Γ)  ⊆  B(l2(Γ)) acting on l2(Γ) by pointwise multiplication. That is if f∈l∞(Γ),  G∈l2(Γ):

[formula]

The group Γ acts on both l∞(Γ) and l2(Γ) by translations:

[formula]

[formula]

Proof: Let 1δ∈l2(Γ) be the function which vanishes everywhere except at δ where it takes the value 1.

Then γ- 1(1δ) = 1γ- 1δ and [formula]. Thus [formula]

On the other hand, Tγ  f(1δ) = (γf)(δ)  ·  1δ  =  f(γ- 1δ)1δ  .

Hence, τ would define a translation invariant linear functional on l∞(Γ), which takes the value 1 on the constant one function. This is in contradiction with the non-amenability of the group Γ. Thus our proposition holds.  Remark: At the 2003 Gaeta Conference, Zelmanov mentioned the following conjecture: If a discrete group of Kazhdan's property (T) is represented on an infinite dimensional vectorspace without a finite dimensional invariant subspace, then the representation is not algebraically amenable.

If the action in the conjecture is in fact unitary, then by the result of [\cite=BV], the representation can not be amenable in the sense of Bekka. Hence by Proposition [\ref=bekka], Zelmanov's conjecture holds for unitary representations.

Now, we are in the position to construct the non-amenable skew field. Let us consider the von Neumann algebra [formula] of the free group of two generators. The algebra [formula] satisfies the Ore-condition with respect to its non-zero divisors and thus it imbeds to the ring of affiliated operators [formula] By Lemma 10.51 of [\cite=Lueck] there exists a skew field [formula] such that [formula] namely the division closure of [formula] in [formula].

[formula] is a non-amenable skew field.

Proof: Recall [\cite=Lueck] that the von Neumann algebra can be identified with the dense linear subspace of [formula] consisting of those vectors [formula] such that the convolution by w defines a bounded operator on l2(Γ). Thus the natural action of the group [formula] on the vectorspace [formula] must be non-amenable. Since [formula], it is enough to prove that the action of [formula] on [formula] is not algebrically amenable. Let [formula] be a sequence of linear subspaces such that for any [formula]

[formula]

Then by the Ore-property, there exists non-zero divisors [formula] such that [formula]. Then

[formula]

This would mean the action of [formula] on [formula] is algebrically amenable, leading to a contradiction.

Linnell [\cite=Lin] proved that [formula] is the free field. This finishes the proof of our Theorem 1. Note that Proposition [\ref=utolso] and Proposition [\ref=elso] imply the existence of finitely generated non-amenable skew fields.
