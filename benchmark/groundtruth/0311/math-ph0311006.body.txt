Ambitwistor structure of complex 4-eikonal equation

The four-dimensional eikonal equation in flat Minkowski space-time M (we choose the units where c = 1)

[formula]

is fundamental nonlinear Lorentz-invariant equation which governs the propagation of wavefronts (discontinuties of fields) in every relativistic theory  [\cite=fock] [\cite=petrov]. Its complex generalization, with [formula], naturally arise in geometrical optics and quasiclassical limit of quantum theory  [\cite=maslov] as well as in GTR  [\cite=wilson]. Singular solutions of eikonal equation and its relations to other fields have been studied by H. Bateman  [\cite=bate] and, recently, by E.T. Newman et al.  [\cite=newman]. Possible interpretation of singularities as particles was discussed by Yu.P. Pyit'ev  [\cite=pitiv] (for 5D-real eikonal) and A.M. Vinogradov  [\cite=vinogr] (from general viewpoint); see also our work  [\cite=trish].

In the version of biquaternionic analysis proposed in our works  [\cite=kass] [\cite=kass2] [\cite=kass3] [\cite=kass4] complex eikonal equation (CEE) ([\ref=eik]) plays the role similar to that of the linear Laplace equation in complex analysis. Its nonlinearity arises as a direct consequence of the noncommutativity of biquaternion algebra.

The method to obtain the general integral of eikonal equation, i.e. the solution dependent on an arbitrary function (starting from the so called "complete integral"), is well known (see, for example,  [\cite=landau] [\cite=newman]). We not only extend these results to the complex holomorphic case. Making use of the obtained twistor and ambitwistor structure of CEE, we present its general solution, in a manifestly Lorentz and gauge invariant form, and demonstrate that arbitrary CEE' solution belongs to one of two and only two different classes. The procedure is extremely simple and can be regarded as generalization of the known Kerr theorem for shear-free null geodesics  [\cite=penrose] [\cite=kerr]. The problem of classification and evolution of singularities of the eikonal wavefronts and of the related caustics also becomes quite transparent in the scheme developed below.

In the [formula]-case static solutions to CEE do exist, the known example is given by the Kerr twisting congruence with a ring-like singularity (leading to stationary Kerr metric in GTR). In section 2 we present another static solution to CEE with singularity of a similar ring-like structure.

For one of the two fundamental classes of CEE' solutions deep connections with solutions of gauge and metric fields can be revealed. In particular, for Maxwell field related to these solutions of CEE electric charge is necessarily a whole multiple of some "unit", elementary one. These and other facts form the premises of the algebraic field theory - algebrodynamics - which we briefly discuss in section 3.

To start with, let us represent CEE  ([\ref=eik]) in equivalent Pfaffian form

[formula]

where the two [formula]-spinors φ  =  {φA} and [formula] are introduced, and dX is the differential of hermitian matrix of space-time coordinates [formula]. For the latters we'll use the standard representation [formula] with {x,y,z,t} being the Cartesian coordinates and the time respectively. Condition ([\ref=pfaff]) in components reads

[formula]

and is equivalent to CEE ([\ref=eik]) since we have

[formula]

because of the factor structure of the r.h.s. of Eq.([\ref=compon]). Conversely, the complex gradient 4-vector [formula] should be null in view of CEE and, therefore, can be always represented in the form  ([\ref=compon]) with some spinors φ,ψ. The latters are projective in nature being defined up to a complex scalar multiplier λ(X), in view of the following symmetry of Eq.([\ref=pfaff]):

[formula]

We proceed now with equivalent transformation of Eq.([\ref=pfaff]) of the form

[formula]

Here the pair of 2-spinors [formula] related to the space-time points (precisely, to the lightcone of the point X) by the incidence condition

[formula]

forms the projective null twistor [formula]. Analogously, the pair of 2-spinors [formula] forms the dual twistor for which the spinors are related by

[formula]

Moreover, twistors [formula] are orthogonal to each other because of the identity

[formula]

where by < , >  the (redifined, see the footnote above) twistor scalar product is denoted.

A pair of mutually orthogonal (projective) twistors is known as an ambitwistor  [\cite=lebrun] [\cite=penrose]. Ambitwistor structure is closely related to the flow of null geodesics on a generic manifold and, by this, to its Riemannian metric structure  [\cite=lebrun]. In invariant twistor form CEE ([\ref=eik]) can be written as

[formula]

Thus, we see that every solution S(X) to CEE may be considered to depend on the space-time coordinates X only "implicitly", i.e. via the components of projective twistor W(X) = {ψ(X),β(X)} defined by the structure of null 4-gradient ([\ref=compon]), i.e. S = S(ψ(X),β(X)). Below, it's natural to distinguish two different classes of solutions for which three components of projective twistor [formula] are functionally dependent and not.

First class of solutions to CEE

Let us assume that for some solution of CEE three projective components of related twistor [formula] are independent with respect to space-time coordinates X and in some region of M. Making use of the symmetry ([\ref=symm]), we can consider then that all four twistor components [formula] are functionally independent. Then in view of ([\ref=pfaff]) the eikonal function S = S(ψ,β) will be a function of twistor coordinates while the components of the dual twistor {φ,γ} need to have the form

[formula]

Applying now the incidence relation ([\ref=inc2]) we get

[formula]

and, finally,

[formula]

Two Eqs.([\ref=mcond]) implicitly define two unknown spinor components [formula] at almost every space-time point X (exept at a subset of zero measure, see below). Subsequently resolving algebraic system ([\ref=mcond]) for different 'parameters' X and selecting a continious branch of roots we come to some field distribution for the spinor ψ(X) and, accordingly, for β(X) = Xψ(X). Substituting them into S(ψ,β) we determine the dependence of generating function S(ψ(X),β(X)) on space-time coordinates.

To make sure that the function [formula] which we've obtained really satisfy CEE let differentiate it with respect to the coordinates [formula] and get

[formula]

In the region of regularity of derivatives [formula] where they all are bounded, we have in account of Eqs.([\ref=mcond]):

[formula]

so that the eikonal equation [formula] is identically satisfied.

On the other hand, the locus where the derivatives of ψ(X) are singular corresponds to the branching points of [formula]-valued solutions (multiple roots) of algebraic system ([\ref=mcond]), i.e. to the caustic condition

[formula]

Thus, we have proved the following

Theorem 1.  Every (analytical) solution S(X) to CEE for which all three components of related projective twistor [formula] are functionally independent, can be generated by some arbitrary (holomorphic) twistor function S(ψ,Xψ) via its differentiation and subsequent resolving of algebraic system ([\ref=mcond]) with respect to [formula]. Such solutions have branching points determined by condition ([\ref=sing]). Conversely, any function S(ψ,Xψ) for which conditions ([\ref=mcond]) can be resolved, define a solution of CEE. [formula]

Of course, the procedure can be simplified by means of the choice of a special gauge. Making use of partial arbitrariness of the spinor ψ implied by the symmetry ([\ref=symm]) we can reduce to unity one of the components of the spinor ψ, say [formula]. Then twistor components acquire the form

[formula]

and generating twistor function reduces to

[formula]

it should be then differentiated with respect to G, and algebraic equation

[formula]

in the region of regularity, results in some solution G(X) and, subsequently, - in some solution S(G(X),β(X)) of CEE. Singularity condition ([\ref=sing]) reduces by this to

[formula]

In the form presented by ([\ref=gengau]),([\ref=condgau]),([\ref=singau]) the procedure becomes much similar to that used for determination of singularities of caustics and wavefronts in the theory of differentiable mappings  [\cite=arnold] [\cite=arnold2] and to the method discribed in recent works of E.T. Newman with his colleagues  [\cite=newman]. However, twistor methods make the procedure quite transparent and preserve Lorentz and gauge invariance of CEE. We'll further see also that for [formula] another class of CEE' solutions does exist which has no analogues in the real case.

Even for the class of solutions dealt with above, unlike the real case where always the light-like evolution of wavefronts always takes place, a new type of static solutions (for which both G(X) and S(X) don't depend on time at all) can be obtained in the [formula]-case since the equation

[formula]

can then possess nontrivial solutions. As an example, in order to obtain a static axisymmetrical solution, let us take the generating twistor function

[formula]

where constant positive [formula] and z*  =  z + ia. Applying the procedure described above we easily find

[formula]

and for CEE' solution correspondent to ([\ref=stat])

[formula]

Both functions ([\ref=statG]),([\ref=statG]) are single-valued, and the spinor field G is regular on the whole 3-space. However, the eikonal function S as well as its complex (null) gradient vector [formula] become singular at a ring of radius 'a', i.e. at

[formula]

The solution ([\ref=statS]) has, therefore, much in common with the famous Appel-Kerr static (stationary) solution of the equations of shear-free null congruence (see below, section 3) whose singular locus is of the same ring-like structure as in ([\ref=ring]). However, in the case considered we have a great number of static (axisymmetrical) solutions to CEE for which the singular locus is bounded in space; we expect to study them in detail, together with nonstatic solutions, in the forthcoming paper.

Second class of CEE' solutions and related physical fields

It remains for us to consider the case when three components of projective twistor arising in the form ([\ref=change]) of CEE are functionally dependent . Making again use of the projective structure of spinors ψ,φ manifested by the symmetry ([\ref=symm]) we can choose the spinor [formula] in such a way that any three components of the full twistor [formula] would be functionally dependent. This means that in the case considered, for every solution of CEE, two algebraic constrains between twistor components should exist, of the form

[formula]

where Π(C), ~ C = 0,1 are two arbitrary and independent (holomorphic) function of four twistor 'coordinates'. Analogously to Eqs.([\ref=mcond]) from the previous section, algebraic system ([\ref=syst]) in implicit form can define, for a pair of Π(C) being choosed and in the region of regularity, a solution for the spinor ψ(X).

Let some solution [formula] of Eqs.([\ref=syst]) and, consequently, [formula] is found. Then in view of the form ([\ref=change]) of CEE every (analytical) twistor function [formula] can in principle be a solution to CEE (though really it would depend only on two functionally independent twistor arguments).

To make it sure we first differentiate with respect to coordinates [formula] the generating system ([\ref=syst]) and get

[formula]

where by [formula] the quantities in square brackets are denoted, and [formula] is the matrix inverse of

[formula]

Note that in view of Eqs.([\ref=der]) solutions [formula] of algebraic system ([\ref=syst]) are defined exept in the singular locus represented by the condition

[formula]

We'll see further that at these points which correspond to multiple roots of Eqs.([\ref=syst]) the strengths of associated physical fields become singular.

Let us now make use of general expression ([\ref=numb]) for derivatives of a twistor function S(ψ(X),β(X)). Substituting into it the current expression ([\ref=der]) for spinor derivatives we get

[formula]

where [formula] are the same as in Eq.([\ref=mcond]) and the spinor φA is now defined by the expression in square brackets. We thus see again that the complex 4-gradient [formula] is identically null because of its factorized structure manifested by the r.h.s. of Eqs.([\ref=der2]), so that CEE is satisfied for every generating twistor function. In this way we come to the following

Theorem 2.  Every (analytical) solution to CEE for which three components of related projective twistor [formula] are funcionally dependent, can be generated by some two arbitrary and independent twistor functions Π(C)(ψ,Xψ) via resolving the algebraic system ([\ref=syst]) with respect to ψ(X), and is represented by arbitrary twistor functions S(ψ(X),Xψ(X)) 'built' on the solutions ψ(X). Branching points for S(X) and ψ(X) are defined by the condition ([\ref=sing3]). Conversely, for any pair of Π(C) for which the constraints ([\ref=syst]) can be resolved, a class of solution of CEE S(ψ(X),Xψ(X)) is defined. [formula]

As in the previous section the procedure can be essentially simplified by fixing of gauge. Let one of the components of the main spinor, say [formula], be nonzero in some region of space-time. Then it can be brought to unity and we come to the gauge ([\ref=twg]) used before. Now, however, three projective twistor components ([\ref=twg]) are considered to be functionally dependent; the constrains ([\ref=syst]) reduce to one algebraic equation of the form

[formula]

which implicitly define an analytical solution G(X) everywhere exept in the branching points given by the reduced form of Eqs.([\ref=sing3]):

[formula]

and, of course, on the curves where G(X) becomes zero or infinite. Having available a solution G(X) of Eq.([\ref=systGG]) we may be sure that any generating function of three projective twistor components 'built' on G(X), i.e.

[formula]

(precisely, of any two functionally independent of them) should satisfy CEE. For some solutions to CEE [formula] can be zero; in this case another gauge can be used to obtain them in analogous manner.

It's worthy of notice that solutions G(X) of generating algebraic equation ([\ref=systGG]) define geometrically the shear-free null geodesic congruences [\cite=penrose] [\cite=kerr] which are related, in particular, to Riemannian metrics of Kerr-Schild type. Indeed, Eqs.([\ref=der]), in the gauge we have used, reduce to the system

[formula]

where k(X),l(X) are two remaining nonzero components of the matrix [formula] defined by Eqs.([\ref=der]). Eliminating them from Eqs.([\ref=ququ]) we come to the following nonlinear system:

[formula]

which is known to define the principal spinor of a shear-free null congruence and whose general solution, in accord with the Kerr theorem  [\cite=penrose] [\cite=kerr], is implicitly given by Eq.([\ref=systGG]).

As to the gauge-free representation, Eqs.([\ref=der]) can be rewritten in the following invariant matrix form:

[formula]

([formula]) which has been earlier proposed in our works  [\cite=kass] [\cite=kass2] [\cite=kass4] [\cite=joz11]) in the framework of biquaternionic generalization of Cauchy- Riemann equations and which was interpreted as a basic dynamical system (nonlinear, over-determined, nonLagrangian) for some peculiar algebraic field theory ('algebrodynamics' ). The latter deals with nontrivially interacting 2-spinor field ψ(X) and [formula]-matrix (complex 4-vector) field [formula] and was studied also in  [\cite=joz] [\cite=joz12] [\cite=trish].

Let us briefly enumerate the most important features of this theory (for details see  [\cite=joz11] [\cite=kass11]). For system ([\ref=GSE]) an unusual gauge symmetry does exist, the so called 'weak one', which corresponds to the transformations of the form

[formula]

with a gauge parameter [formula] which is allowed to depend on coordinates [formula] only implicitly, via the components of the trasforming spinor ψ(X) and of its twistor counterpart β(X) = Xψ(X).

Owing to the gradient-wise type of its transformations, the matrix field [formula] can be interpreted as 4-potentials of some ([formula]-valued) 'weak' gauge field. Indeed, the integrability conditions of Eqs.([\ref=GSE]) [formula] result in the self-duality of (matrix) field strengths correspondent to potentials Φ(X) and, in its turn, - in fulfilment of gauge fields' equations. Precisely, both [formula]-valued Maxwell and Yang-Mills equations are satisfied identically on the solutions of Eqs.([\ref=GSE]), for the trace and the trace-free part of the full matrix field strength respectively. For the spinor of complex electromagnetic field strength F(AB)(X) a beatiful twistor-like expression was obtained in  [\cite=joz11]:

[formula]

where ΠA,ΠAB, ~ A,B = 0,1 denote the (1-st and 2-d order) derivatives of some function Π(G,β0,β1) with respect to its twistor arguments βA, and Q = dΠ / dG is the same as in Eq.([\ref=sing4]). If for any Π (after differentiation) the solution G(X) of generating Eq.([\ref=systGG]) is substituted into ([\ref=emspin]) the spinor F(AB) will identically satisfy vacuum Maxwell equations (exept in the points of singularities given by Q = 0).

Thus, for any solution G(X) of Eq.([\ref=systGG]) condition ([\ref=sing4]) defines the shape and the time evolution of singularities of some associated electromagnetic field. Such singular loci can be zero-, one- or two dimensional. In the case when the singularities are bounded in 3-space they define some singular, particle-like objects with nontrivial dynamics simulating interaction of particles and even their transmutations.

Moreover, the value of electric charge associated with bounded singularities of electromagnetic field ([\ref=emspin]) is necessarily quantized (i.e., equal to the whole multiple of some mimimal charge)  [\cite=kass] [\cite=kass2] [\cite=kass11]. Such "elementary" charge is carried, in particular, by the source of the exeptional static, axisymmetrical Appel-Kerr solution

[formula]

generated by the function ([\ref=systGG]) of the form

[formula]

Its ring-like singularity ([\ref=ring]) (branching curve of the G(X)) is the sameas for the first-class solution of CEE ([\ref=statS]); it might be interpreted then as a source of electromagnetic field defined by (the real part of) Eqs.([\ref=emspin]). The electromagnetic field itself is identical to that of the field of the Kerr-Newman solution in GTR but can carry only 'unit', elementary charge (q =   ±  1 / 4 in the accepted system of units). General theorem on the charge quantization has been proved in  [\cite=kass11]. This fact, incidentally, revives the well-known Carter-Lopez model of electron  [\cite=carter] [\cite=lopes] [\cite=joz]. In the limit a  →  0 the field turns into the 'unit-charged' Coulomb field.

In conclusion, we remind that Eqs.([\ref=GSE]) which we discussed above in the framework of general algebraic field theory are actually equivalent to the equations of shear-free null geodesic congruences ([\ref=ququ1]) and represent the second class of solutions to CEE we studied above.

General solution of complex eikonal equation

We are going now to bring together the results obtained in theorems 1 and 2 and to describe the general solution to CEE ([\ref=eik]).

Theorem 3. Let in some open subspace O  ⊂  M there exists an analytical function [formula] which is there a solution to CEE. Then the compoments of projective spinor [formula] and related projective null twistor [formula] are defined via the structure of null 4-gradient [formula], and for every solution [formula]) is a twistor function, i.e. depends on coordinates X only implicitly, as follows:

[formula]

In ([\ref=twis]) the spinor function ψ(X) satisfy either the system ([\ref=mcond]) or the system ([\ref=syst]).

Conversely, any analytical solution to CEE belongs to one of two different classes and can be generated by one S( or two Π(C),C = 0,1 arbitrary and independent twistor functions for which algebraic equations ([\ref=mcond]) or ([\ref=syst]) can be (analytically) resolved in some subspace O  ⊂  M with respect to ψ(X).

In the first case (when [formula]), all (projective) twistor components are independent, and the solution of CEE is represented by the function [formula] itself, the branching points being defined by Eq.([\ref=sing]).

In the second case (when Π(C) = 0), only two projective twistor components remain functionally independent. Then the solution is represented by arbitrary (analytical) function [formula] and implicitly depends on X through two independent twistor arguments only. Branching points are then defined by Eq.([\ref=sing3]). [formula]

To conclude, we show that the Cauchy problem for CEE with arbitrary analytical initial data S(x,y,z,t0) = SC being given at the moment t = t0 can be resolved in a simple algebraic way using the procedure above-presented. Indeed, one immegiately obtains at t = t0 the 4-gradient [formula] and the three components of one of the projective twistors, say [formula] (in the matrix X the time coordinate is also settled to t0). Now it's a trivial step to find out if these three components are functionally independent or not. In the second case, we immegiately obtain (in the gauge for the spinor used) the constrain condition ([\ref=systGG]) represented by a twistor function [formula]. Similarly, in the first case we algebraically express the spatial coordinates x,y,z via three independent twistor components and after substitution into SC come again to a twistor function ([\ref=gengau]) [formula]. Then, in both cases, disposing of generating twistor functions Π or S and considering now the time coordinate in X to be free we are able to obtain the full time-dependent solution to CEE corresponding to the given Cauchy data by the prosedure described above (i.e. by solving respectively the equations Π = 0 or dS / dG = 0 with respect to the projective spinor component G(X)). The examples of this quite transparent procedure will be presented elsewhere.
