Extending states on finite concrete logics

Introduction

The question of extending states on quantum logics is sometimes surprisingly combinatorially involved. In spite of the progress made by the authors referred to in the abstract above, several questions remain open (see e.g. [\cite=ovc] and [\cite=pt1]). It therefore seems helpful to have the situation clarified in the "testing" case of the logic of even-number-element subsets of a set. This is what we intend to do in this note. Our results may partially overlap with the results of the previous effort but we are not aware of them being explicitly formulated elsewhere.

Notions and results

We shall exclusively deal with finite concrete (= set representable) quantum logics and states (= probability measures) on them as defined below. Standardly, for a set X we stand exp (X) for the (Boolean) power algebra of X.

The chief question we ask here reads as follows: Having given a (concrete) logic Δ on a set X and having given a state s on Δ, when can we extend s as a state (resp. as a signed measure) over the entire algebra exp X? Expressed more formally, given a state s on Δ, when can we find a state t (resp., a signed measure t) on the Boolean algebra exp X such that t restricted to Δ equals to s? Let us observe first that certainly not always. In fact, we even do not have the "weak" extensions (= extensions of states to signed measures) of two-valued states at our disposal as the following simple example shows.

Let [formula], and let Δ be the smallest concrete logic on X containing the following four sets:

[formula]

Obviously, [formula] (for the reader acquainted with the theory of orthomodular lattices, Δ is a representation of the orthomodular lattice MO4). Let us take the (two-valued) state s:Δ  →  {0,1} defined as follows:

[formula]

We claim that this state s cannot be extended over exp X as a signed measure. Indeed, suppose that m:Δ  →  I  R is a signed measure which extends s. Then

[formula]

and, analogously,

[formula]

But if in the left-hand side we replace m by s, we obtain 0 in the first equality, and we obtain 4 in the second. A contradiction, thus, such an extension m of s does not exist.

It turns out, however, that many concrete logics do allow for the latter kind of extension. Such are for instance the logics of the following type (the conceptual value of these logics within various questions of quantum theories has been indicated in [\cite=gu], [\cite=pp], [\cite=svo], etc.). Given a finite set X of even cardinality, we denote by Xeven the concrete logic of all subsets of X whose cardinality is even.

Let X be a finite set of an even cardinality. Let s be a state on Xeven. Then s can be extended as a signed measure over exp X.

We can suppose that [formula] (otherwise, the result is trivial). Take an arbitrary triple x,u,v of distinct elements of X. Let

[formula]

We claim that [formula] is independent of the choice of u,v. Further, we claim that letting x vary in X, we have defined a mapping [formula] with the property that upon setting [formula] for any subset A of X, this m constitutes a signed measure which extends s.

Let us first check that our definition of [formula] is correct, i.e. let us show that [formula] does not depend upon the choice of u,v. Take first a couple v,w such that x,u,v,w are distinct. Let us show that both the couples u,v and v,w define the same [formula]. Write

[formula]

We want to show that f(x,u,v) = f(x,v,w). Let us compute the difference

[formula]

Further, for a general element t∈X distinct from x,u,v,w, we have f(x,u,v) = f(x,v,w) = f(x,w,t), proving independence of the value [formula] on the choice of u and v. Let us check that m defined as above extends s. Take a set A = {x,y}  ⊆  X. Then we can find u and v such that x,u,v,w are distinct and therefore

[formula]

The proof is complete.

Let us comment shortly on the previous result. Firstly, in the logic Xeven we generally cannot extend states as states (see also [\cite=bha]).

Let [formula], [formula], [formula]. Consider the state s on Xeven such that s({1,c}) = 0 and [formula] for all [formula], b  ≠  c. If m is any signed measure on exp X extending s we have [formula] and [formula] for all [formula].

Secondly, observing that each two-valued state on Xeven, with [formula], has to be a Dirac state (i.e. a state sitting in a point), we see that there must be extreme states on Xeven which are not two-valued (in fact, in [\cite=napt] we have constructed some). And, thirdly, it is worthwhile observing that Th. [\ref=ext-even] can also be proved, like many extension theorems which happen to hold, by the well-known criterion of Horn and Tarski (see e.g. [\cite=bha]). In the case of Th. [\ref=ext-even] it would present another proof of a similar complexity. A minor advantage of the proof method used in Th. [\ref=ext-even] is that it gives the result for group-valued measures for the groups which allow for dividing by 2. Observe in passing that, for instance, the extension problem of course-grained measures as treated in [\cite=gm] and [\cite=ovc] finds in our opinion the Horn-Tarski criterion an effective proof device (see [\cite=dspt]).

The logics of Xeven present a distinguished example of so-called difference-closed concrete logics. The latter logics were introduced in [\cite=ovc] under the name of symmetric concrete logics. In this note, let us use our notation (in our opinion more suggestive).

It seems natural to conjecture that Th [\ref=ext-even] can be generalized to all (finite) difference-closed logics. However, this is not the case.

Let [formula]. Consider the smallest concrete logic L of subsets of X which is difference-closed and contains the sets A = {0,1,4,7},  B = {0,2,5,8},  C = {0,1,2,3} and D = {0,4,5,6}. (For the reader acquainted with the theory of orthomodular lattices, the logic L is a representation of MO15(thus, difference-closed logics can be lattices without being Boolean). The logic L has 15 mutually non-disjoint elements consisting of 4 points and 15 elements consisting of 6 points that constitute the complements of the former ones).

Let s be a state on L such that s(A) = s(C) = s(AδB) = 1 and s(B) = s(D) = s(CδD) = 0 (there obviously are such states). Let us show that s cannot be extended as a signed state on exp X.

Looking for a contradiction, suppose that m is such an extension. Since [formula], we obtain

[formula]

and, also,

[formula]

We have reached a contradiction, verifying the required property.

When we find ourselves within the area of difference-closed concrete logics, it seems of interest to deal with rather special states.

The following result indicates the meaning of subadditivity in our context.

Let X be a finite set and let L = (X,Δ) be a difference-closed concrete logic. Let s be a state on Δ which allows for an extension, m, over exp X as a signed measure. Let the intersections of pairs of sets of L generate all atoms of a Boolean algebra on X. Then s is subadditive if and only if m is a state.

Compute s(A) + s(B) - s(AδB). We obtain

[formula]

We therefore see that [formula] is nonnegative precisely when s(A) + s(B) - s(AδB) is nonnegative, which occurs precisely when s is subadditive. We see that the extension m is a state on the Boolean algebra generated by Δ. By the classical theorem, m can be further extended over exp X as a measure. The proof is complete.

Getting back to Th [\ref=ext-even] interplayed with Th [\ref=sub-st], we obtain the following corollary.

Let X be a set of even cardinality. Let s be a state on Xeven. Then s can be extended over exp X as a state if and only if s is subadditive.

A natural question arises if a difference-closed logic allows for extensions of states over exp X as signed measures. Regretfully, it is not the case. We demonstrate it in our final result.

Let us again consider the logic L of the previous Ex. [\ref=nine]. Let us consider the state s defined by setting

[formula]

[formula]

It is not difficult to check that s is a subadditive state on L. This state s cannot be extended over exp X as a signed measure. Indeed, let m be such an extension. Then

[formula]

whereas, analogously,

[formula]

This is a contradiction.
