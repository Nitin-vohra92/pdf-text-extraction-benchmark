The completely bounded approximation property for extended Cuntz-Pimsner algebras

Introduction

The Haagerup invariant for a C*-algebra A is defined to be the smallest constant Λ(A) for which there exists a net {φα:A  →  A}α∈N of finite rank maps satisfying

[formula]

If no such net exists then Λ(A) is defined to be ∞  , while if Λ(A) <   ∞   then A is said to have the completely bounded approximation property (CBAP). The definition of Λ(A) arose from [\cite=H] [\cite=deCan]. In the first of these it was shown that [formula], the reduced C*-algebra of the free group on two generators, has such a net of contractions, and a stronger result using complete contractions was obtained in the second paper. Subsequently, many examples of different values of Λ(  ·  ) were given in [\cite=CowH]. An interesting problem is to investigate the behavior of Λ(  ·  ) under the standard constructions of C*-algebra theory. In [\cite=SScam], the formula [formula] was established for the minimal tensor product, while [formula] was proved for discrete amenable groups in [\cite=SS] and for general amenable groups in [\cite=NS]. Our objective in this paper is to show that Λ(B) = Λ(E(H)), where E(H) is the extended Cuntz-Pimsner algebra arising from a Hilbert B,B-bimodule over a C*-algebra B, [\cite=P]. The C*-algebras E(H) appear in several areas of operator algebras, notably in the work of Muhly and Solel, [\cite=MS1] [\cite=MS2], and in work of the first author with Shlyakhtenko, [\cite=DS]. It was shown in the latter paper that E(H) is exact if and only if B is exact. Since exactness is a well known consequence of the CBAP, (see, for example, the argument in [\cite=NS]), this suggested the connection between Λ(E(H)) and Λ(B). (See also the remarks at the end of this paper.) We now review briefly the definition of E(H).

A right Hilbert B-module H has a B-valued inner product 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉B, conjugate linear and linear respectively in the first and second variables, and is said to be full if {〈h1,h2〉B:h1,  h2∈H} generates B. The C*-algebra [formula] consists of the B-linear operators T:H  →  H for which there is a B-linear T*:H  →  H satisfying 〈Th1,h2〉B  =  〈h1,T*h2〉B, and operators in [formula] are called adjointable. The C*-algebra [formula] contains the closed ideal [formula], that is generated by the maps of the form

[formula]

for arbitrary pairs x,y∈H, [\cite=L]. If there is an injective *  -homomorphism [formula], then there is a left action of B on H by (b,h)  ↦  ρ(b)h, and we say that H is a B,B-bimodule. The full Fock space [formula] is defined to be [formula], where [formula] is the n-fold tensor product [formula], which is also a Hilbert B,B-bimodule. For h∈H, the operator [formula] is defined on generators by

[formula]

These are bounded adjointable operators on [formula] and satisfy

[formula]

Then E(H) is the C*-algebra generated by [formula], introduced by Pimsner in [\cite=P].

Our approach to investigating Λ(E(H)) follows the methods of [\cite=DS]. There, a sequence of operations was given to construct E(H) from B in such a way that exactness was preserved at each step. Here we show that the Haagerup invariant is preserved, with the main technical device being Theorem [\ref=thm:Lses] concerning quotients of C*-algebras.

Results

For a short exact sequence

[formula]

of C*-algebras, we cannot expect, in general, a relationship between Λ(A), Λ(J) and Λ(A / J), [\cite=NS]. However, our first result shows that these quantities are closely linked when the short exact sequence splits. The proof requires the notion of a quasi-central approximate identity for a closed ideal J contained in a C*-algebra A, introduced in [\cite=AP] [\cite=A]. This is an approximate identity {eα}α∈N, 0  ≤  eα  ≤  1, which has the additional property of asymptotically commuting with the elements of A in the sense that

[formula]

Such approximate identities always exist, [\cite=AP] [\cite=A].

Let J be an ideal in a C*-algebra A, let π: A  →  A / J be the quotient map, and suppose that there exists a completely contractive map ρ: A / J  →  A such that [formula]. Then

[formula]

Fix [formula], [formula], and fix ε > 0. We will construct a finite rank map γ: A  →  A such that [formula], 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, and [formula]. This will then prove "≤  " in the equality.

Fix δ > 0, to be chosen later. Let {eα}α∈N be a quasi-central approximate identity for J satisfying 0  ≤  eα  ≤  1. By definition of Λ(A / J), there exists a finite rank map ψ: A / J  →  A / J, [formula], such that for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. Define a finite rank map [formula] by Clearly [formula] and, since [formula], we may choose elements ji∈J such that

[formula]

Now {eα}α∈N is an approximate identity for J so, for each α∈N, we may choose β(α)∈N, β(α) > α, such that

[formula]

Note that taking adjoints in [\eqref=eq4] gives

[formula]

also. For each α∈N, choose a finite rank map φα: J  →  J, [formula] such that

[formula]

Then define [formula] by These maps are finite rank, and satisfy [formula]. Then, for each α∈N, define γα: A  →  A by

[formula]

Each of these maps can be expressed as a matrix product from which it is clear that [formula]. It remains to be shown that

[formula]

for a sufficiently large choice of α∈N. We will estimate the two terms on the right hand side of [\eqref=eq8] separately, when x is replaced by ai.

The term [formula] equals, by definition, e1 / 2αφα(eβ(α)aieβ(α))e1 / 2α so, from [\eqref=eq6], for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. A simple triangle inequality argument, using [\eqref=eq4] and [\eqref=eq5], then shows that

[formula]

for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n.

The second term, [formula], in [\eqref=eq8] is within δ of (1 - eα)1 / 2(ai  +  ji)(1 - eα)1 / 2, from [\eqref=eq3]. Combining this estimate with [\eqref=eq8] and [\eqref=eq12] gives Thus

[formula]

The nets {e1 / 2α}α∈N, and {(1 - eα)1 / 2}α∈N asymptotically commute with each ai, and as α  →    ∞  , so a sufficiently large choice of α in [\eqref=eq14] gives Now take δ to be ε / 4, and [\eqref=eq10] is proved.

We now turn to the inequality Λ(J)  ≤  Λ(A). Given [formula], [formula], and ε > 0, we may choose a finite rank completely bounded map φ: A  →  A such that [formula] and For each α∈N, define φα: J  →  J by then each φα has finite rank, [formula], and, for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n,

[formula]

A sufficiently large choice of α in [\eqref=eq19] gives showing that Λ(J)  ≤  Λ(A).

Finally we show that Λ(A / J)  ≤  Λ(A). Consider elements [formula], and fix ε > 0. There exists φ: A  →  A such that φ has finite rank, [formula], and

[formula]

for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. Apply π to [\eqref=eq21] to obtain for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. Now define [formula] by Clearly [formula] has finite rank, [formula], and for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. This shows that Λ(A / J)  ≤  Λ(A), proving the result.

If we loosen the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=thm:Lses] and require only that ρ be completely bounded, then the same proof yields the inequalities

[formula]

The next three results are preparatory for Theorem [\ref=main], and will handle some technical points arising there.

Let A and B be C*-algebras. Let E be a right Hilbert A-module and let F be a right Hilbert B-module with a *  -homomorphism [formula]. Consider the internal tensor product [formula], which is a right Hilbert B-module. Let [formula] and suppose [formula] is such that T and φ(a) commute for all a∈A. Then there is [formula] satisfying [formula]; we will write [formula].

The operator [formula] is well known to belong to [formula]; (see [\cite=L]). It will suffice to show [formula], for in general we will have [formula]. Hence, without loss of generality, we assume [formula].

The [formula]-linear map from the algebraic tensor product (over [formula]) [formula] to itself defined by [formula] is a right B-module map and sends the submodule

[formula]

into itself. In order to see that the resulting map [formula] gives rise to a bounded B-linear map [formula], let [formula], [formula] and [formula], and let [formula]. Then

[formula]

where f is the column vector [formula] in the Hilbert B-module Fn, where X is the matrix [formula], which, by [\cite=L], is positive, and where [formula] is the *  -homomorphism obtained by application of φ to each element of a matrix. On the other hand, letting [formula], we have

[formula]

where [formula]. Therefore, ( cf [\cite=L]),

[formula]

and [formula]. Consequently, we get [formula] with [formula]. An easy calculation shows that [formula] is the adjoint of [formula]. Thus [formula].

Let [formula] be an increasing chain of C*-subalgebras of a C*-algebra A, such that [formula] is dense in A. Suppose that there are conditional expectations ρn:An + 1  →  An onto An, n  ≥  1. Then

[formula]

From the family [formula] we obtain conditional expectations ψn:A  →  An onto An, n  ≥  1. It then follows that Λ(A)  ≥  Λ(An) for all n  ≥  1.

To see the reverse inequality in [\eqref=eq:LAn], let [formula], let F  ⊆  An be a finite subset and let ε > 0. Then there is a finite rank map φ:An  →  An such that [formula] for all x∈F and [formula]. But [formula] satisfies [formula] for all x∈F and [formula].

Let B be a C*-algebra and let H be a right Hilbert B-module such that {〈h1,h2〉B:h1,h2∈H} generates B. Then [formula].

Following the notation of [\cite=B], let Cn(B) denote the right Hilbert B-module which consists of columns over B of length n with the B-valued inner product

[formula]

Then, by [\cite=B] and the part of the proof found on [\cite=B], there exist nets of adjointable contractive maps

[formula]

such that

[formula]

These maps induce a diagram

[formula]

of complete contractions given by

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula], whose compositions converge to [formula] in the point norm topology. The relations

[formula]

for hi∈H, ki∈Cn(α)(B), are easy to check and show that [formula] and [formula] have the appropriate ranges in ([\ref=eq2.10]). Now [formula] is the matrix algebra [formula] over B, for which [formula].

Given [formula] and ε > 0, choose α∈N so large that

[formula]

and then choose a finite rank map [formula] such that [formula] and

[formula]

Then [formula], the composition of the diagram

[formula]

has finite rank with completely bounded norm at most Λ(B), and the triangle inequality gives

[formula]

from ([\ref=eq2.11]) and ([\ref=eq2.12]). This shows that [formula].

We are now able to state and prove the main result of the paper.

Let B be a C*-algebra and let H be a Hilbert B,B-bimodule such that {〈h1,h2〉B:h1,h2∈H} generates B. Consider the extended Cuntz-Pimsner C*-algebra E(H). Then Λ(E(H)) = Λ(B). In particular, E(H) has the completely bounded approximation property if and only if B does.

We will follow quite closely the proof of [\cite=DS]. Since B is contained as a C*-subalgebra of E(H) which is the image of a conditional expectation E(H)  →  B, we have Λ(B)  ≤  Λ(E(H)).

Let [formula] and identify H with the submodule [formula]. Then (see [\cite=P]), E(H) is contained in [formula] in the obvious way. There is a projection [formula] that commutes with the left action of B, and using Proposition [\ref=prop:ST] to take tensor products of copies of P yields a projection [formula], compression with respect to which gives a conditional expectation [formula]. Therefore, [formula].

We will show that [formula]. By [\cite=DS], [formula] is isomorphic to the crossed product [formula] of a certain C*-subalgebra [formula] by an injective endomorphism Ψ, that is given by Ψ(a) = LaL* for an isometry [formula]. As described by Cuntz [\cite=C] and Stacey [\cite=S] (see also the discussion on p. 432 of [\cite=DS]), the crossed product [formula] is isomorphic to a corner [formula] of the crossed product of a C*-algebra [formula] by an automorphism α, where [formula] is the inductive limit C*-algebra of the system

[formula]

We have [formula]. From [\cite=SS], we have [formula]. Letting σ:A  →  A be σ(a) = L*aL, we have that σ is a completely positive left inverse of Ψ. Thus [formula] is a conditional expectation from A onto Ψ(A) and Proposition [\ref=prop:Lind] applies to the inductive limit [\eqref=eq:APsi]. We conclude that [formula].

From the proof of [\cite=DS], we have an increasing chain

[formula]

of C*-subalgebras of A, such that [formula] is dense in A. Moreover, for each [formula] there is an ideal In  ⊆  An such that An / In is isomorphic to An - 1; this isomorphism followed by the inclusion [formula] splits the short exact sequence

[formula]

Finally, the ideal In is isomorphic to [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=prop:KH], Λ(In)  ≤  Λ(B). Using Theorem [\ref=thm:Lses] and proceeding by induction, one shows that Λ(An)  ≤  Λ(B) for all [formula]. The quotient map An  →  An / In followed by the isomorphism An / In  →  An - 1 is a left inverse for the inclusion [formula]. Thus, Proposition [\ref=prop:Lind] applies to the chain [\eqref=eq:AnA] and we obtain Λ(A)  ≤  Λ(B).

These inequalities, applied sequentially, lead to Λ(E(H))  ≤  Λ(B).

Concluding remarks

An interesting open problem is whether taking reduced (amalgamated) free products preserves the class of C*-algebras that possess the CBAP, or, for example, the class of C*-algebras having Haagerup invariant equal to 1. It was shown in [\cite=DS] that a reduced free product C*-algebra A,

[formula]

can be embedded into E(H) for a particular Hilbert bimodule H over [formula]. It was also shown in [\cite=DS] that a reduced amalgamated free product C*-algebra A,

[formula]

can be realized as a quotient of a subalgebra of E(H') for a particular Hilbert bimodule H' over [formula]. This, together with the result from [\cite=DS] that E(H) is exact when H is a Hilbert bimodule over an exact C*-algebra, yielded a new proof that the class of exact C*-algebras is closed under taking reduced (amalgamated) free products. (See [\cite=D] for the first proof of this fact.)

However, this paper's Theorem [\ref=main] does not answer in a similar way the question about the CBAP for free products, (at least not obviously), because the CBAP does not automatically pass to subalgebras or to quotients. Moreover, the copy of the free product C*-algebra A from [\eqref=eq:Afp] in E(H) exhibited in [\cite=DS] is not in general the image of a conditional expectation E(H)  →  A. To see this, first note from [\cite=G] that E(H) is a nuclear C*-algebra whenever H is a Hilbert bimodule over a nuclear C*-algebra. (This also follows readily from the proof of exactness found in [\cite=DS], combined with the conditional expectation [formula] used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=main].)

There are many known examples when A1 and A2 in [\eqref=eq:Afp] are nuclear, but their free product A is not nuclear. In these cases, E(H) is nuclear and A, therefore, cannot be the image of a conditional expectation E(H)  →  A.
