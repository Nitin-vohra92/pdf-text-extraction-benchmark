Quasi-invariants of dihedral systems

M. Feigin

A basis of quasi-invariant module over invariants is explicitly constructed for the two-dimensional Coxeter systems with arbitrary multiplicities. It is proved that this basis consists of m-harmonic polynomials, thus the earlier results of Veselov and the author for the case of constant multiplicity are generalized.

Introduction

We start with the introducing the main object of our considerations, the algebra of quasi-invariants. Consider a Coxeter system R in [formula] which consists of the non-collinear pairs of vectors {  ±  α} with prescribed multiplicities [formula]. The corresponding Coxeter group G is generated by the reflections [formula], α∈R:

[formula]

The group G should be finite and the set of reflections [formula] must be the set of all the reflections in G. The multiplicity function [formula] is supposed to be invariant:

[formula]

for any g∈G, α∈R.

A polynomial p(x) is called quasi-invariant related to the system R if it satisfies the condition s p(x) - p(x) = O( (α,x) ) near the hyperplanes (α,x) = 0 for any α∈R. Equivalently,

[formula]

For instance, if a polynomial p(x) belongs to the ring SG of polynomials invariant under the geometric action of the Coxeter group, then [formula] for any α∈R, and therefore property ([\ref=quazi]) is satisfied. Thus the quasi-invariants [formula] form a ring containing the ring of invariants SG.

The rings of quasi-invariants were introduced by Chalykh and Veselov in 1990 in the context of quantum integrable systems [\cite=CV]. The authors showed that to each quasi-invariant q(x) it corresponds a differential operator Lq  =  χ(q) of the form

[formula]

and all such operators Lq commute. Under the homomorphism χ the quasi-invariant [formula] corresponds to the generalized Calogero-Moser operator [\cite=C3] [\cite=M] [\cite=OP2] L=Δ-∂. Here R+ is a subset of vectors from R belonging to a halfspace, and Δ is the Laplace operator in [formula]. Therefore each quasi-invariant q(x) leads to the quantum integral Lq of the Calogero-Moser problem ([\ref=cmoperator]). As it is explained in [\cite=FV2] the commutative ring of all quantum integrals for ([\ref=cmoperator]) is isomorphic to the ring of quasi-invariants [formula].

We note that the homomorphism χ on the invariant polynomials was considered by Heckman and Opdam for a general multiplicity function [\cite=HO]. It is crucial that for the integer multiplicity function the ring [formula] of quantum integrals becomes larger than the ring of invariants SG, and the ring depends on these integer parameters, as it all was discovered by Chalykh and Veselov [\cite=CV]. The necessity to consider integer multiplicities to get larger commutative rings have been justified recently by Taniguchi [\cite=T].

The first investigation of the ring [formula] was done by Volchenko, Kozachko, and Mishachev [\cite=VKM] in the case of dihedral system with multiplicity equal 1. The authors found the multiplicative generators of the ring. The more complete description of the ring [formula] for the dihedral systems with constant multiplicity function [formula] was carried by Veselov and the author [\cite=FV2]. It turned out that for the dihedral system I2(N) consisting of N lines on the plane [formula] the ring QI2(N) is a free module over the subring of invariants [formula]. These module has 2N generators [formula] such that the linear space [formula] spanned by these generators is the solution space of the following system of two equations

[formula]

[formula]

and the determinant formulas for hi were found. It was conjectured in [\cite=FV1] that the ring of quasi-invariants [formula] is free as a module over invariants SG for any Coxeter system R. It was also conjectured that one can take m-harmonic polynomials as a basis in this free module. The space Hm of m-harmonic polynomials consists of the solutions to the following system of equations

[formula]

where σ is an arbitrary element from the ring SG+ of invariant polynomials with free term equal zero (see [\cite=FV1]).

Etingof and Ginzburg remarkably proved in [\cite=EG] that the ring [formula] is free over invariants SG for any Coxeter system R. But the choice of a basis in Hm as a free basis for the quasi-invariant module is impossible in general (see counterexample in [\cite=EG]). Nevertheless the degrees of homogeneous generators coincide with the degrees of homogeneous basis in Hm, as it is proved in [\cite=EG]. The free generators should form a basis in the complement to ideal generated by homogeneous invariants of positive degree in [formula]. The problem to produce some particular choice of such a basis remains open.

Besides the Cohen-Macaulay property for the quasi-invariant algebra, the Gorenstein property was also established by Etingof and Ginzburg [\cite=EG]. One of the two proofs given in [\cite=EG] is based on the results of Felder-Veselov paper [\cite=FeV]. In that paper the authors in particular compute the Poincare polynomial for the space Hm of m-harmonic polynomials. The Gorenstein property corresponds to the palindromicity of the Poincare polynomial for Hm which was conjectured in [\cite=FV1].

The differential operators on the singular algebraic variety corresponding to [formula] were studied by Berest, Etingof, and Ginzburg in [\cite=BEG]. The authors proved that the algebra of differential operators is simple and Morita equivalent to the Weyl algebra of polynomial differential operators in n-dimensional space.

In the present paper following [\cite=F] we describe the quasi-invariants of dihedral systems I2(2N) with arbitrary (invariant) multiplicities (m,n). We give explicit formulas for the generators of the ring QI2(2N) as a module over invariants SI2(2N) generalizing the formulas from [\cite=FV2]. It occurs that in this case as in the case of dihedral systems with constant multiplicity [\cite=FV2], one can take as the generators a homogeneous basis in the space Hm of m-harmonic polynomials. Therefore we obtain explicit determinant formulas for the basic m-harmonic polynomials for arbitrary dihedral systems.

The technique used in this paper is different from the approach in [\cite=FV2] where dihedral systems with constant multiplicity were considered. Now we heavily use the results of Etingof-Ginzburg [\cite=EG] and Felder-Veselov [\cite=FeV]. This approach allows to reduce the explicit calculations essentially. The scheme of our considerations is the following.

In Section 2 we review the result of Felder and Veselov on the Poincare polynomial for m-harmonics, and we write down explicitly the Poincare polynomial PHm for dihedral m-harmonics. By Etingof-Ginzburg theorem the degrees of homogeneous generators for quasi-invariants have degrees given by PHm. In Section 3 we prove that these generators can be chosen to have a particular form. To do this we argue as follows. We take a general polynomial of degree under consideration and impose quasi-invariant conditions. From Etingof-Ginzburg theorem it follows that this system of equations must have a solution. From the form of equations it follows that it must also exist a solution of the desired form. Then we check that the linear span of the quasi-invariants of the form constructed does not belong to the ideal generated by homogeneous invariants of positive degree. This can be easily done using again the Etingof-Ginzburg theorem. Thus we conclude (by Etingof-Ginzburg theorem) that we have constructed a free basis with elements of particular form.

In Section 4 we check firstly that the constructed basis is m-harmonic. This is due to the special form of the chosen basis, here we again use the Etingof-Ginzburg theorem. Then we come back to the system of quasi-invariant conditions which defined our basis. We note that for a polynomial of our form the set of quasi-invariant conditions leads to m-harmonicity of this polynomial. In particular, the polynomial of our form is uniquely determined by the set of quasi-invariance equations. This fact allows us to get explicit determinant formulas for m-harmonic polynomials and therefore for the basis of quasi-invariant module.

Poincaré polynomial for dihedral groups

Let PHm(t) be Poincaré polynomial for the space Hm of m-harmonic polynomials related to a Coxeter system R,

[formula]

where H(i)m is the space of homogeneous m-harmonic polynomials of degree i. The following formula for PHm(t) was found by Felder and Veselov in [\cite=FeV], P(t)= t P(t). In this formula the external sum is carried over all non-isomorphic irreducible representations of a Coxeter group G. The internal sum is carried over the classes Ca of conjugate reflections in G. Polynomial Pj is the Poincaré polynomial for representation Vj in the space [formula], where I0 is the ideal in the ring of polynomials generated by homogeneous invariants of positive degree. That is, the coefficient at tk equals the dimension of isotypic component of the representation Vj in the kth grade of [formula]. Then

[formula]

where Na is a number of elements in the class Ca, and

[formula]

ma is a multiplicity for reflections [formula].

For dihedral group I2(N) with odd N there are two one-dimensional non-isomorphic irreducible representations and [formula] two-dimensional ones. All the reflections are conjugate and Na = N. Since in the complex coordinates the ring of invariants is isomorphic to [formula], one can choose generators in factor-space as follows

[formula]

For one-dimensional representations the piece of sum ([\ref=poincare]) has the form

[formula]

where the first term corresponds to the trivial representation Vtriv which is realized on the constants. The second term corresponds to the sign representation Vsign which is realized on the vector zN  -  N. We've also used that

[formula]

[formula]

Consider now two-dimensional representations. Representation Vi is realized as 〈zi,i〉 and as 〈zN - i,N - i〉. Then

[formula]

Totally we get

[formula]

Now let us consider even dihedral system I2(2N). We have two classes Ca and Cb of conjugate reflections each of which consists of N elements. Denote the multiplicities of reflections as ma = m and mb = n. As in the odd case

[formula]

At first we analyze one-dimensional representations and calculate the corresponding terms in the Poincaré polynomial. There are four one-dimensional representations for I2(2N) depending on whether each class of reflections Ca,Cb acts as 1 or -1.

Vtriv  =  〈1〉. The corresponding term in ([\ref=poincare]) is equal to 1.

Vsign  =  〈z2N  -  2N〉, [formula]. The contribution to the Poincaré polynomial is t(m + n + 1)2N.

Vsign1  =  〈zN  +  N〉. One gets

[formula]

which leads to t(2n + 1)N term in ([\ref=poincare]).

Vsign2  =  〈zN  -  N〉. One gets

[formula]

which leads to t(2m + 1)N term in ([\ref=poincare]).

Indeed, representations Vsign1,Vsign2 are defined by the property that for any s∈Ca,τ∈Cb

[formula]

[formula]

The dihedral group is generated by two reflections s∈Ca,τ∈Cb such that (sτ)2N = 1. Also it is generated by s and sτ. In our notations we can think of s as a reflection with respect to line z = , and sτ would be a rotation by the angle [formula]. Thus the following formulas hold where [formula]. Then representation Vsign1 is characterized by the property

[formula]

or equivalently

[formula]

Obviously the following action of group elements holds

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus Vsign1  =  〈zN  +  N〉 and if ms = m,mτ = n then the contribution of this irreducible representation to the Poincaré polynomial would be t(2n + 1)N. Analogously Vsign2  =  〈zN  -  N〉 since

[formula]

and

[formula]

the corresponding term in the Poincaré polynomial is t(2m + 1)N.

Now let's turn to two-dimensional irreducible representations. Representation Vi is realized twice in [formula] as the space 〈zi,i〉 and as 〈z2N - i,2N - i〉, [formula]. Thus Pi(t) = 2ti + 2t2N - i in ([\ref=poincare]). For all the reflections s∈Ca,τ∈Cb one has [formula], hence [formula] and we get the term in the Poincaré polynomial equal to 2t(m + n)N(ti + t2N - i). Summing up P= 1 + t+ t + t + 2 t( t + t).

Generators of quasi-invariants

We recall the following key theorem proven by Etingof and Ginzburg [\cite=EG] (see also [\cite=FV1]).

[\cite=EG] For any Coxeter system R the ring of quasi-invariants [formula] is free as a module over invariants SG of the corresponding Coxeter group G. As the generators one can take any homogeneous representatives of the factor space [formula], where I is the ideal in [formula] generated by the homogeneous invariant polynomials of positive degrees. The degrees of the homogeneous generators coincide with the degrees of a homogeneous basis in the space Hm of m-harmonic polynomials.

We are going to determine what are the polynomials that can be taken as the generators for dihedral groups. As the case of constant multiplicity function is already considered in [\cite=FV1] we shall suppose that our group is even dihedral group I2(2N) with different multiplicities, for instance m > n. By Theorem [\ref=EGt] the degrees of generators for QI2(2N) over invariants are same as the degrees of basic m-harmonic polynomials. According to ([\ref=poindi]) they satisfy

[formula]

where [formula]. And we get the following table for number of generators of corresponding degree:

[formula]

Let us introduce the normal vectors [formula] to the lines of reflections. Namely, [formula], the multiplicities mi = m for even i and mi = n for odd i. Let's define the following four quasi-invariants

[formula]

where μ1,μ2,μ3 are some constants. It's obvious that q0 and q3 are quasi-invariants. Polynomial q1 is also quasi-invariant. Indeed, conditions on the lines (αi,x) = 0 with odd i are obviously satisfied. If i is even then the conditions follow from the invariance sαiq1 = q1. Analogously, q2∈QI2(2N).

These quasi-invariants will be a part of the basis for QI2(2N) over invariants that we are constructing.

Quasi-invariants q0,q1,q2,q3 defined by ([\ref=q]) do not belong to the ideal I generated by homogeneous invariants of positive degree SI2(2N)+ in the ring QI2(2N).

Proof According to Theorem [\ref=EGt] the degrees of free generators for QI2(2N) over invariants are given by the table on page . Therefore there are no quasi-invariants of degree less than deg q1 which are not invariants. Since q1 is not invariant we conclude that q1∉I. Let us show that q2∉I. Let r1,2i be independent elements in the complement to I of degrees (m + n)N + i, [formula]. Suppose that q2∈I, that is q=s q+s q+ s r + s r, where s0,s1,s1i,s2i are invariants, i.e. they belong to [formula]. Since deg r1,2i  ≠  0N polynomials s1,2i are divisible by z. Let us consider relation ([\ref=q2]) modulo terms divisible by z. We get

[formula]

Now we get a contradiction as it follows both λ1  +  λ2 = 1, and λ1  +  λ2 =  - 1. Therefore relation ([\ref=q2]) is impossible and q2∉I.

Let us finally show that q3∉I. As above we obtain that the following relation must hold

[formula]

λ (z+) (z+) +λ(z+) +O(z). We obtain λ1  =  λ2 = 0 as for any a,b the degrees of monomials in z and in [formula] which are obtained from the first two terms of the right hand-side in ([\ref=q3]) have the form N  ·  (). And in the left-hand side the result of dividing degree by N is 2(m + n + 1) which is even. Further we conclude that the right-hand side of ([\ref=q3]) takes the form λ3(z2Nc  +  2Nc) + O(z), and the equality ([\ref=q3]) is impossible. Hence q3∉I and the proposition is proved.

The proved proposition shows that polynomials q0,q1,q2,q3 may be chosen as a part of free basis for QI2(2N) over invariants. The rest 2N - 4 polynomials in a basis consist of pairs of polynomials of degrees (m + n)N + i with [formula]. The next Proposition and Theorem show that these quasi-invariants may be chosen to have more or less simple form.

There exist quasi-invariants q1,2i of the form for [formula].

Proof Let r1,2i be some basis in the homogeneous complement to I of degree (m + n)N + i, [formula]. Let us consider two-dimensional space 〈r1i,r2i〉. As it does not intersect I we may think that

[formula]

[formula]

Let us consider the quasi-invariance conditions for the first polynomial

[formula]

The lines (αj,x) = 0, [formula] are given by the equations z = εj where ε2N = 1, and ε is a primitive root. The quasi-invariance condition ∂2t - 1αjr1i = 0 at (αj,x) = 0  ⇔  z = εj takes the form

[formula]

or, equivalently,

[formula]

Let t satisfy [formula]. Then quasi-invariance conditions are nontrivial for all 2N lines [formula]. The conditions may be rewritten in the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

This system of equations is of Vandermonde type. As εp1  ≠  εp2 if p1  ≠  p2 we conclude that

[formula]

Now let us consider the left quasi-invariance conditions corresponding to [formula]. These conditions correspond to the lines with even j. We have

[formula]

where [formula]. Equivalently,

[formula]

where

[formula]

and [formula]. This system of equations is again of Vandermonde type. As ε2p1  ≠  ε2p2 if p1  ≠  p2 and [formula] we conclude that

[formula]

Thus quasi-invariance of the polynomial

[formula]

is equivalent to the following conditions on its coefficients These equations are split to the systems of equations for the sets of coefficients {as} with indexes s having same residue after division by N. As we know that there exists solution to this system ([\ref=qcond]) with a0 = 1, we conclude that there exists solution where the only nonzero coefficients are

[formula]

where δ  =  0 if [formula], and δ = 1 if [formula]. The corresponding quasi-invariant has the form R= a z with the coefficients satisfying the following system of equations

[formula]

a ((m+n-2s)N+i)=0,   1 t n,

[formula]

Since the quasi-invariance equations ([\ref=qcond] (or [\ref=qsplitcond])) are real we conclude that complex conjugate to a quasi-invariant would also be a quasi-invariant. Therefore there exist quasi-invariants

[formula]

with bsN  =  āsN. For [formula] we have δ = 0 and we may define q1i = R1i. Then q1i have a form required by the statement of the Proposition. For [formula] the last nonzero coefficient in R1i is a(m + n + 1)N. Let us show that one can make a(m + n + 1)N = 0. For that consider quasi-invariant

[formula]

We have

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

and the last term in the sum above is equal to zero since b0 = 1. Thus q1i for [formula] also have a form required in the Proposition. Taking complex conjugates we get the quasi-invariants of the form

[formula]

The Proposition is proved.

The quasi-invariants q1,2i together with q0,q1,q2,q3 form a free basis for QI2(2N) over SI2(2N).

By Theorem [\ref=EGt] a set of vectors forms a basis for QI2(2N) over SI2(2N) if it forms a basis in the complement to the ideal I. By Proposition [\ref=freebasis] the polynomials q0,q1,q2,q3 form a part of a basis for QI2(2N) over invariants. We are left to prove that constructed in Proposition [\ref=freebasis] quasi-invariants do not belong to the ideal I generated by homogeneous invariants of positive degree. More exactly one should prove that the linear space [formula]. If the intersection is not trivial then we would have that

[formula]

and

[formula]

where O(z) is a polynomial divisible by z, and λ1,λ2 are some constants. Now, in the right-hand side we should have p(z,) as a linear combination of basis vectors for the complement to I multiplied by polynomial coefficients in z and z2N  +  2N. The degrees of basis vectors are given in the table on page . We see that there are no basis vectors whose degree would be less than (m + n)N + i but equal to (m + n)N + i modulo 2N. Therefore p(z,) must be divisible by z, hence

[formula]

which is possible only if λ1  =  λ2 = 0. Thus the theorem is proven.

Explicit formulas for [formula]-harmonic basis

Let us show that the basis for QI2(2N) just considered in the theorem is actually m-harmonic. Let us denote the quantum integrals corresponding to the invariants z and z2N  +  2N by L1 and L2 respectively. The corresponding operators have the forms (c.f. [\cite=FV2]) L = 4 ∂ ∂-4m -ez+e -4n -ez+e where [formula]. As to operator L2 it has the following form (up to a constant)

[formula]

Polynomials (),() are m-harmonic, that is, the following identities hold

[formula].

[formula]

Proof Let us first establish that polynomials qs are m-harmonic. We have L1(1) = L2(1) = 0 as deg Li(1) < 0 but on the other hand Li(QI2(2N))  ⊂  QI2(2N) (see [\cite=FV1] where this is explained in general case), that is the image is polynomial. Further let us prove that quasi-invariant q3 is m-harmonic. Notice that

[formula]

is characterized by the property that it is anti-invariant quasi-invariant for the group I2(2N) of minimal possible degree. Since operators L1,L2 are I2(2N)-invariant and since their degrees are negative we get that

[formula]

Quasi-invariants q1,q2 are anti-invariant quasi-invariants of minimal possible degree with respect to subgroups I2(N)  ⊂  I2(2N) corresponding to two different orbits of mirrors of the system I2(2N). Since L1, L2 are invariants with respect to these subgroups we get the rest equalities of the first statement of the theorem, namely

[formula]

Let us now prove the second part. Consider two-dimensional space V = 〈q1i,q2i〉 generated by polynomials q1i,q2i. Let us introduce two-dimensional spaces U,W generated by the image of V under the action of operators L1,L2, namely

[formula]

[formula]

As operators L1,L2 are invariant with respect to I2(2N) action, they are intertwining operators between representations V and U, and between V and W correspondingly. According to Schur lemma either these operators are zero operators or one or two of them is scalar operator. The first case corresponds to the conditions 2 in the statement of the theorem. In the second case corresponding representation U (or W) is isomorphic to representation V.

Representation V is two-dimensional irreducible representation. In the basis q1i,q2i generating matrices s and sτ (see ([\ref=sst])) take the form s=( ),  sτ= (-1) ( ). For any q∈W one has deg q = (m + n)N + i - 2N < (m + n)N. Since QI2(2N) is freely generated by qi,q1,2i over SI2(2N), the two-dimensional irreducible representations in QI2(2N) are met in the degrees more or equal to

[formula]

Hence W = 0. Let us show that U = 0 as well. Notice that as it follows from ([\ref=mat]) among representations Vi  =  〈q1i,q2i〉 each irreducible two-dimensional representation of I2(2N) is met twice. Namely, [formula], and under this isomorphism

[formula]

[formula]

If [formula] then representation Vi does not occur in the space QI2(2N) in the degrees less than i. Therefore

[formula]

We are left to consider the case [formula]. Generally speaking we have

[formula]

[formula]

where p1,p2∈SI2(2N). Let us show that it must be p1 = p2 = 0. Recall that

[formula]

Notice that the degree of q1i with respect to variable [formula] is equal to (m + n)N at most. Because of the form ([\ref=L1]) of operator L1 we get

[formula]

On the other hand if p2  ≠  0 we obtain

[formula]

The contradiction shows that p2 = 0. Similarly p1 = 0, and therefore polynomials q1i,q2i are m-harmonic. The theorem is proven.

Quasi-invariants q1i,q2i of the form () are uniquely defined.

Indeed, the linear space of m-harmonics is defined uniquely (see [\cite=FV1]). The space Hi of homogeneous m-harmonics of degree (m + n)N + i is two-dimensional. Therefore quasi-invariants q1i,q2i are uniquely characterized as homogeneous m-harmonics of the form

[formula]

correspondingly, where O(z) denotes polynomials divisible by z.

Finally let us present explicit determinant formulas for quasi-invariants q1i, q2i. Let us introduce (see p. ) the (m + n + 1)  ×  (m + n + 1) matrix A  =  A(i).

For generators [formula] the following formulas hold q=c det A,   q=c det Ā, where c = ( det A1)- 1, and the matrix A1 is obtained from A by deleting the first column and the first row.

Proof Firstly let us show that det A1  ≠  0. During the proof of Theorem [\ref=freebasisT] we showed (see formulas ([\ref=qsplit]), ([\ref=qsplitcond])) that quasi-invariance equations on the coefficients of polynomial

[formula]

have the form

[formula]

a ((m+n-2s)N+i)=0,   1 t n,

[formula]

We know by theorem [\ref=freebasisT] that this system has a solution. Condition det A1  ≠  0 is equivalent to the statement that system ([\ref=quasisyst]) has a unique solution since the matrix of this linear system is exactly A1. But the solution is unique according to Corollary [\ref=unique].

To prove the theorem we need to show that (-1) = a, [formula], where the matrix Ak is obtained from A by deleting the kth column and the first row. According to Kramer's rule the solution [formula] to linear system ([\ref=quasisyst]) is given by the formulas

[formula]

where k is matrix A where the first column and the first row are omitted, and instead of kth column it is written the first column with a minus sign. Changing the sign for this column and interchanging it to the first place we get

[formula]

thus ([\ref=kramer]) is satisfied. Theorem is proven.

Remark. We have deduced formulas for q1,2i under assumption that n < m. Nevertheless Theorem [\ref=formulas] remains true and gives formulas for the basis of quasi-invariant module consisting of m-harmonic polynomials also in the case m = n. One can see that in this case formulas ([\ref=forms]) reduce to the formulas for m-harmonic basis obtained in [\cite=FV2].

Concluding remarks

Generators for general Coxeter systems

In this paper it is completed the description of quasi-invariant modules for two-dimensional Coxeter systems. The description of generators of [formula] over SG in the dimensions greater than two is an open question. In the general case the choice of m-harmonic polynomials is impossible as it is shown by Etingof and Ginzburg [\cite=EG]. But the counterexample found by the authors looks exceptional as it consists of the Coxeter system C6 with multiplicities on the long roots equal 0. The ring of corresponding quasi-invariants may be described as a module over invariants of the Coxeter group A61 with the generators which are m-harmonic polynomials related to the group A61. The question when m-harmonic polynomials can be chosen as the generators of [formula] over SG is an open question when the dimension is greater than two.

Deformed systems

In the papers [\cite=FV3] [\cite=CFV3] the quantum systems of Calogero-Moser type related to non-Coxeter configurations A  =  An(m),Cn  +  1(m,l) were investigated. The corresponding second order operator has the form

[formula]

As in the Coxeter case the commutative ring of quantum integrals for [formula] is isomorphic to the ring [formula] of quasi-invariants related to the system A. It is shown in [\cite=FV3] that the rings [formula] are Cohen-Macaulay, that is they are freely generated over polynomial subrings [formula], which are analogs of the invariant rings in the case of Coxeter systems. The question of description of the rings [formula], and in particular the question on the generators of [formula] as a module over [formula] is an open problem. The natural generalization of m-harmonic polynomials to the non-Coxeter case does not lead to a basis already in the simplest case of the system A2(2) (see [\cite=FV3]).
