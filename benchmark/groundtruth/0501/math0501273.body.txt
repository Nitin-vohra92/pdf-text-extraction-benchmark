Small exotic 4-manifolds with b+2 = 3

Introduction

Many simply connected, smoothable topological 4-manifolds (with b+2 odd) are known to admit infintely many distinct smooth structures. The existence of such exotic structures are, however, less clear when the Euler characteristic of the 4-manifold is small, for example if the manifold is homeomorphic to the (blow-up of the) complex projective plane. Using the rational blow-down construction [\cite=FS1] together with knot surgery [\cite=FSknot] in double node neighborhoods [\cite=FSuj], many new smooth 4-manifolds have been discovered with b+2 = 1 and b-2  ≥  5 [\cite=FSuj] [\cite=P] [\cite=PSS] [\cite=SS]. Similar ideas can be applied to get examples of irreducible exotic simply connected 4-manifolds with b+2 = 3 and relatively small b-2. The study of exotic structures on simply connected manifolds with b+2 = 3 has a rich history. Recall that the K3 surface E(2) is such an example with b-2 = 19. Applying appropriate logarithmic transformations on E(2) it was shown that [formula] admits infinitely many smooth structures [\cite=FMbook] [\cite=MO] [\cite=SSz]. Later works, relying on Gompf's symplectic normal connected sum operation, together with Donaldson theory showed that the topological manifolds [formula] with n  ≥  14 admit infinitely many smooth structures [\cite=Screll] [\cite=Sztop]. More recent results of Park [\cite=Doug1] [\cite=Doug2] [\cite=Doug3] proved the same statement with n  ≥  10. Our main result in this paper improves this bound:

The simply connected topological 4-manifold [formula] admits infinitely many distinct smooth structures.

By modifying the construction used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=t:m1], we can define a set of 4-manifolds which still have b+2 = 3, but their Euler characteristic is smaller than the above examples. In these cases, however, we were unable to show that the manifolds are simply connected.

There are infinitely many pairwise nondiffeomorphic smooth, closed 4-manifolds with vanishing first homology, b+2 = 3, b-2 = 8 and nontrivial Seiberg-Witten invariants.

The proof of the results will involve two steps. First we desribe how to construct the manifolds claimed and then we use Seiberg-Witten theory in proving that they are nondiffeomorphic. In the construction we will apply mapping class group arguments and the theory of Lefschetz fibrations. Using the knot surgery construction then we can identify configurations of curves in the resulting 4-manifolds which can be rationally blown down, leading us to the desired examples.

Elliptic fibrations and mapping class groups

Recall that a genus-1 Lefschetz fibration f:X4  →  S2 can be described by the word in the mapping class group Γ1 of the 2-torus T2 corresponding to the monodromy presentation of f. More precisely, a point x∈X where df is not onto (called a singular point of the fibration) gives rise to a singular fiber f- 1(f(x)), and the monodromy of the fibration around such a fiber can be given by the composition of Dehn twists along the circles corresponding to the vanishing cycles of the singular points of the fiber. By traversing through the singular fibers in a counterclockwise manner relative to a fixed base point s0∈S2, we get the above mentioned word describing the fibration. Notice that we do not assume that f is injective on the set of its singular points, that is, a singular fiber can contain more than one singular points. The assumption that the map f is a Lefschetz fibration implies that the vanishing cycles corresponding to the singular points in one fixed singular fiber can be chosen to be disjoint.

It is known that the mapping class group Γ1 can be generated by two elements a,b∈Γ1 which are subject to the two relations

[formula]

In fact, Γ1 can be shown to be isomorphic to [formula] by mapping a to [formula] and b to [formula]. Since the forgetful map from the mapping class group Γ11 of the 2-torus with one marked point to Γ1 is an isomorphism, we get that any genus-1 Lefschetz fibration admits a section.

Genus-1 Lefschetz fibrations were classified by Moishezon [\cite=Mois], who showed that after a possible perturbation such a fibration over S2 is equivalent to one of the fibrations given by the words (ab)6n ([formula]) in Γ1. The resulting 4-manifold is usually called E(n) (the simply connected elliptic surface with section and of holomorphic Euler characteristic n), and E(2) is the famous K3 surface. It can be shown that a section of E(n)  →  S2 has self-intersection - n.

Following [\cite=HKK] we call a fiber with monodromy conjugate to ak of type Ik ([formula]). When k = 1, the corresponding fiber is also called a fishtail fiber. It is easy to see that topologically a singular fiber of type Ik (k  ≥  2) is a plumbing of k smooth 2-spheres of self-intersection - 2 plumbed along a circle (see [\cite=HKK]), while a fishtail fiber is an immersed 2-sphere with one positive double point. Since in T2 nonisotopic simple closed curves necessarily intersect each other, it is easy to see that a genus-1 Lefschetz fibration can have only Ik-fibers as singular fibers. The fibration f can be perturbed near a singular fiber F of type Ik into a fibration f' which is the same as f outside of F but breaks F into two singular fibers of types Ik1 and Ik2 with k1 + k2 = k. This fact implies that a generic genus-1 Lefschetz fibration admits only fishtail fibers. In our study however, we will find it most helpful to understand what kind of other singular fibers an elliptic fibration can admit.

The construction for b-2 = 9

We start with a proposition showing the existence of a particular genus-1 fibration on E(2).

There exists an elliptic Lefschetz fibration on the K3 surface E(2) with a section, a singular fiber F of type I16, three singular fibers F1,F2,F3 of type I2 and two further fishtail fibers.

It is not hard to see that the word (ab)12 (defining a genus-1 Lefschetz fibration on the K3 surface E(2)) in the mapping class group Γ1 of the torus is equivalent to

[formula]

(Alternatively, by substituting a and b with the matrices they correspond to under the map [formula], we can check that the above product is equal to the identity matrix.) By collecting the powers of a in the front using conjugation, we get a16 followed by the product of three squares of some conjugates of b and two further conjugates of b. Since a conjugate of b by a word x∈Γ1 corresponds to the Dehn twist along the image under the diffeomorphism x of the curve inducing b, the proposition follows. As we already mentioned, genus-1 Lefschetz fibrations always admit sections.

Perturb first the above fibration near the I2 fibers Fi (i = 1,2,3) in a way that these give rise to fishtail fibers Fi',Fi'' with isotopic vanishing cycles. Let us denote the resulting Lefschetz fibration by f:E(2)  →  S2.

Let K1,K2,K3 be three twist knots as depicted in [\cite=FSuj]. Let ZK1,K2,K3 denote the 4-manifold we get after performing three knot surgeries with knots K1,K2,K3 along three regular fibers in the fibration on the K3 surface found above. Because of the existence of fishtail fibers in the complement with nonisotopic vanishing cycles, we conclude that π1(ZK1,K2,K2) = 1. If we perform the surgeries in the double node neighborhoods near the fishtail fibers F1',F1'', and F2',F2'' and F3',F3'' respectively, then we can find a 'pseudo-section' S as in [\cite=FSuj] which is an immersed sphere of self-intersection ( - 2) with three positive double points, intersecting the further fishtail fibers and the I16 fiber F transversally. Next smooth the intersections of this pesudo-section S with two further fishtail fibers. The result is an immersed sphere of self-intersection 2 having 5 positive double points. Now blow up the 4-manifold ZK1,K2,K3 in the five double points of this sphere, and find an embedded sphere of self-intersection - 18 in [formula]. Let C denote the tubular neighborhood of the linear plumbing of spheres given by this ( - 18)-sphere together with 14 of the ( - 2)-spheres in the I16 fiber F. It is not hard to see that C is diffeomorphic to C16,1 in the notation of [\cite=SS], cf. also [\cite=FS1] [\cite=Pratb]. It is then easy to show that ∂C = ∂C16,1 can be given as the oriented boundary of the rational ball B16,1, see [\cite=CH] [\cite=FS1] [\cite=SS]. Define XK1,K2,K3 as the rational blow-down of [formula] along C, that is,

[formula]

For any twist knots K1,K2,K3 the 4-manifold XK1,K2,K3 is homeomorphic to [formula].

Notice that ZK1,K2,K3 is simply connected, and the complement of C in [formula] is simply connected since the ( - 2)-sphere in F intersecting the last ( - 2)-sphere of the linear chain C provides a hemisphere which contracts the generator of the fundamental group of ∂C. Since π1(∂B16,1) surjects onto π1(B16,1) under the natural embedding, Van Kampen's Theorem implies that XK1,K2,K3 is simply connected. Now simple signature and Euler characteristics computation together with Freedman's Theorem [\cite=Fr] verifies the result.

For short, let Xn denote the 4-manifold XK1,K2,K3 if K1 = K2 = K3  =   the n-twist knot Tn. The following proposition is true in a wider generality, we restrict our attention to the special case K1 = K2 = K3 in order to keep our discussion as simple as possible. Using the results of [\cite=FS1] [\cite=FSknot] the Seiberg-Witten invariants of Xn can be easily computed. This computation immediately shows

There are two cohomology classes [formula] with the property that the Seiberg-Witten function SWXn of Xn is equal to zero for all classes K  ≠    ±  L and SWXn(  ±  L) =   ±  n3.

By [\cite=FSknot] the Seiberg-Witten invariant of Zn = ZTn,Tn,Tn can be computed to be equal to

[formula]

(use the facts that the Seiberg-Witten function of the K3 surface is equal to 1 and the Alexander polynomial of Tn is ΔTn = nt - (2n - 1) + nt- 1). This result, together with the blow-up formula shows that the five-fold blow-up [formula] has exactly two Seiberg-Witten basic classes ±  K which evaluate on the ( - 18)-sphere of the configuration C as ±  16. Moreover, the value of the Seiberg-Witten function on these basic classes is ±  n3. Now [\cite=FS1] implies that Xn has two basic classes, on which the value of the Seiberg-Witten function is equal to ±  n3, verifying the result.

The 4-manifolds Xn are pairwise nondiffeomorphic irreducible smooth 4-manifolds.

The 4-manifolds Xn provide an infinite family of smooth 4-manifolds all homeomorphic to [formula] according to Proposition [\ref=p:hom], and by Corollary [\ref=c:nondiffeo] these manifolds are pairwise nondiffeomorphic. Therefore the set [formula] provides an infinite collection of distinct smooth structures on [formula], hence the proof is complete.

4-manifolds with b+2 = 3 and b-2 = 8

Using a variation of the above procedure, closed 4-manifolds with b+2 = 3 and b-2 = 8 can be constructed as follows. Consider the fibration f:E(2)  →  S2 found above, containing a singular fiber of type I16 and eight fishtail fibers, out of which three pairs Fi',Fi'' (i = 1,2,3) have isotopic vanishing cycles. Proceed as before by doing three knot surgeries along three regular fibers with twist knots K1,K2,K3 and -- using the double node neighborhoods provided by the fishtail fibers Fi',Fi'' -- identify the 'pseudo-section', which is again an immersed sphere with homological square - 2 and has three positive double points. As before, resolve the two positive intersections of this pseudo-section with the remaining two fishtail fibers, and find the immersed sphere with 5 double point and homological square 2. Blow up the 4-manifold at the double points of the pesudo-section, and consider the resulting sphere of square - 18 in ZK1,K2,K3. This sphere intersects the I16 fiber F transversally in a unique point P which is on the ( - 2)-sphere Σ0  ⊂  F. Now Σ0 is intersected by two other spheres in F, let Σ1 be one of them and denote the intersection point of Σ0 and Σ1 by Q. Apply 17 infinitely close blow-ups at Q. The resulting plumbing manifold C305,17 can be given by the linear plumbing

[formula]

[formula]

As before, it is routine to see that the boundary ∂C305,17 can be given as the boundary of the rational ball B305,17, hence we can blow it down, resulting the 4-manifold YK1,K2,K3. Since the normal circle of the pseudo-section (which circle generates the first homology of ∂C305,17) vanishes in the homology of the complement [formula] (as it is shown by a regular fiber), the Mayer-Vietoris sequence implies that [formula] vanishes. Simple Euler characteristic and signature computations now imply

The 4-manifolds YK1,K2,K3 have b+2 = 3 and b-2 = 8.

Finally, by computing Seiberg-Witten invariants of these manifolds in the fashion it was done in Theorem [\ref=t:sw], we get that the 4-manifolds Yn = YTn,Tn,Tn are pairwise nondiffeomorphic, all with nonvanishing Seiberg-Witten invariants, verifying the claim of Theorem [\ref=t:m2].
