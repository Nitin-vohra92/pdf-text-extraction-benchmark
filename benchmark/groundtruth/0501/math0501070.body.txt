New techniques for bounds on the total number of Prime Factors of an Odd Perfect Number

Introduction

Here and throughout, n is any natural number, and N is a hypothetical odd perfect number. Let σ(n) denote the sum of the positive divisors of n. We say that n is perfect if σ(n)  =  2n. It is known that if σ(n)  =  2n and n is even, then n  =  2k - 1(2k - 1) where 2k - 1 is a Mersenne prime. Currently there are no known odd perfect numbers. First shown by Euler, it is well known that if an odd perfect number exists, then it must be of the form

[formula]

where [formula] are distinct primes and [formula].

Based on ([\ref=eq:odd]) we define the total number of prime factors of an odd perfect number as

[formula]

and we define the total number of distinct prime factors of N as

[formula]

A number of bounds have been derived for Ω(N). Cohen showed that Ω(N)  ≥  23 [\cite=Cohen82]. Sayers showed that Ω(N)  ≥  29 [\cite=Sayers86]. Iannucci and Sorli showed that Ω(N)  ≥  37 [\cite=IannucciSorli03]. The author extended this to give Ω(N)  ≥  47 [\cite=Hare05a]. This paper extends this result to give

If N is an odd perfect number, then Ω(N)  ≥  75.

In proving these results, the methods of [\cite=Hare05a] were modified and applied. For an introduction and explanation of the algorithm we refer the interested reader there.

To some extent, with the modification of the algorithm given here, the calculation becomes a matter of book-keeping. In [\cite=Hare05a] there was a specific road-block which prevented any further calculation. This is no longer the case. With enough computational power, we could get to any number, although the amount of time required appears to be exponential, more than doubling every time we increase the bound by 4 (see Table [\ref=tab:times]). So it is just a matter of how much computer power to dedicate towards the problem. The choice of 75 in the theorem was motiviated by the fact that it was sufficiently large to demonstrate the improvement in the algorithm while still remaining reasonable with respect to computation time.

Definitions and Notation

For any prime p, by [formula] we mean pa|N and [formula]. By [formula] we mean either pa + 1|N or [formula]. We define the function σ- 1(n) as

[formula]

A number of simple results concerning σ- 1(n) are summarized below.

Let n be any natural number. Then

σ- 1(n) is a multiplicative function, i.e. if (n,m)  =  1 then σ- 1(n  ·  m)  =  σ- 1(n)σ- 1(m),

σ- 1(n)  >  1 for all n  >  1,

σ- 1(n)  =  2 if and only if n is perfect,

[formula] for all primes p and integers a  ≥  1.

There are a number of useful results concerning ω(N), the total number of distinct prime factors.

Let N be an odd perfect number. Then

ω(N)  ≥  8 [\cite=Chein79] [\cite=Hagis80].

If [formula] then ω(N)  ≥  11 [\cite=Hagis83] [\cite=Kishore83].

If [formula] and [formula] then ω(N)  ≥  15 [\cite=Norton61].

If [formula], [formula] and [formula] then ω(N)  ≥  27 [\cite=Norton61].

If [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula], then ω(N)  ≥  41 and hence Ω(N)  ≥  81.

The last result is probably not the tightest possible, but it is sufficient for our purposes. It follows immediately by noticing that the product [formula] for the first 40 primes strictly greater than 11 is less than 2. So, for our purposes it suffices to assume that Ω(N)  ≤  73 and show as a result that [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula], which gives the desired contradiction.

This last result is well known in the literature. We use the version given in [\cite=CohenSorli03].

Let

[formula]

be an odd perfect number, where the pi and qj are distinct primes with the pi and αi known. Define

[formula]

Then we have,

[formula]

moreover, if r  ≥  3 we have the tighter bound

[formula]

Furthermore we have the lower bound

[formula]

Taking h  =  σ- 1, μ  =  1, h(λ)  =  S and w  =  r, this follows directly from equations (2.3), (4.1) and (2.4) of [\cite=CohenSorli03].

Assume that N  =  32  ·  134  ·  30941  ·  qβ11  ·  qβ22 is an odd perfect number. Then by Lemma [\ref=lem:Carl] we can assume that 3.5962  <  q1  <  8.1924. So in, particular we can assume that q1  =  5 or 7.

The Algorithm and Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]

Suppose [formula], as before. To prove that Ω(N)  ≥  K, we assume that [formula] and obtain a contradiction for every combination of α and βi. As mentioned above, it suffices to assume that Ω(N)  ≤  73 and show as a result that [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] to obtain our contradiction.

There are two main modifications to the algorithm in [\cite=Hare05a]. First, as opposed to doing every individual case of

[formula]

Comments and Acknowledgments

In [\cite=Hare05a] it was said that there were three numbers that needed to be factored, without which the algorithm in [\cite=Hare05a] could not be continued. Using the methods of Carl Pomerance, this problem was avoided. At this point, the calculation was terminated not by a particular obstruction, but instead because 75 was esthetically pleasing. Further, 75 was sufficiently large to demonstrate the improvement in the algorithm while still remaining reasonable with respect to computation time. The purpose of this paper was to demonstrate a new technique to extend this bound, and not necessarily to extend this bound to the farthest extent possible.

I would like to thank Phil Carmody, Christophe Clavier, Don Leclair Paul Leyland, Tom Womack, Paul Zimmermann, and the people at http://mersenneforum.org who helped provide factorizations for the numbers

σ(σ(322112)22), a 927-digit number, with a factor of:

which I had listed in [\cite=Hare05a] as obstructions to my calculations. This information was included in the hints database used by the code.

I am also indebted to Carl Pomerance for bringing a weaker form of Lemma [\ref=lem:Carl] to my attention [\cite=Pomerance74], and more importantly how this could be applied to improve the existing bound. I would also like to thank the unknown referee for the reference [\cite=CohenSorli03], which replaced Lemma 2.3, as well as many other useful suggestions and comments.

Also, I would like to acknowledge William Lipp, the creator of www.oddperfect.org, for providing some additional factorizations. (The website www.oddperfect.org is a website, which when complete, will co-ordinate an attack to improve the lower bound on odd perfect numbers, of N  ≥  10300, given by [\cite=BrentCohenTeRiele91].)
