Mapping class group representations and Conformal Field Theory

Institute for Theoretical Physics, E�tv�s University, Budapest

Introduction

String theory and the closely related Conformal Field Theories have led to many exciting interactions between mathematics and theoretical physics in the past two decades. Among other things, they stimulated the creation of two new mathematical concepts: that of Vertex (Operator) Algebras [\cite=Bo] [\cite=FLM] and of Modular Tensor Categories [\cite=Turaev] [\cite=MTC]. Both have found important applications in the sequel, e.g. Vertex Algebras are the basis of our present understanding of Moonshine (the relation between the representation theory of the Monster - the largest sporadic simple group - and modular functions), while Modular Tensor Categories provide new topological invariants of 3-manifolds [\cite=Witten] [\cite=Turaev]. While Vertex Operator Algebras may be understood as the mathematical formulation of the chiral algebras of Conformal Field Theory, Modular Tensor Categories formalize the so-called Moore-Seiberg data [\cite=MS1] [\cite=MS]. The above two concepts are closely related, as follows from Huang's recent proof of the Verlinde conjecture [\cite=Huang].

A Modular Tensor Category provides, among other things, a sequence

[formula]

of finite dimensional linear spaces that afford representations of the mapping class groups

[formula]

of closed surfaces, where Γg denotes the mapping class group of a surface of genus g. This sequence of representations, called sometimes the "modular tower", is very special, with many relations between its different terms, and it does characterize the Modular Tensor Category to a great extent. The aim of the present paper is to review some properties of this sequence that could prove useful in attempts to classify Modular Tensor Categories. As one may expect, the best understood term is the first one, which is nothing but a finite dimensional representation of the classical modular group [formula], but we'll see that this [formula] module is already very special in many respects, and does have a profound influence on the structure of the subsequent terms.

In the next section we'll summarize some properties of the [formula] module [formula] which form the basis of most results to follow. Section [\ref=sec:The-Galois-action] describes what we know about the number theoretic properties of this representation, while Section [\ref=sec:The-projective-kernel] discusses the structure of its (projective) kernel. In Section [\ref=sec:Trace-identities] we'll turn to the study of the higher terms of the modular tower, and see the deep influence the first term [formula] has on their structure. Finally, we'll discuss briefly the implications of these results on the problem of enumerating systematically Modular Tensor Categories.

The modular representation

As alluded to in the introduction, each Modular Tensor Category determines a finite dimensional module [formula] of the classical modular group [formula]. Actually much more is true, for this module comes equipped with a distinguished basis whose elements correspond to the simple objects of the category, and the representation matrices relative to this basis enjoy some remarkable properties. To explain these properties, let's first recall that the group [formula], consisting of the unimodular two-by-two integer matrices, is generated by the matrices [formula] and [formula]. As is customary, we'll denote by T and S respectively the matrices representing these two [formula] elements in the above mentioned distinguished basis. Of course, the matrices T and S have to satisfy the defining relations of the group [formula], namely S4 = 1 and the modular relation

[formula]

The fundamental properties of the modular representation are [\cite=Verlinde] [\cite=MS]:

The matrix T is diagonal and has finite order;

The matrix S is symmetric;

S2 is a permutation matrix (of order 2);

There is a row of S (usually labeled by 0) all of whose entries are positive;

The expressions

[formula]

related to the decomposition of tensor products of simple objects, yield non-negative integers for any choice of simple objects p,q,r (remember that the rows of S are labeled by the simple objects of the category).

All these properties are satisfied by the modular representation associated to a Modular Tensor Category, but it is not too hard to construct examples of pair of matrices T and S that satisfy all of them, but do not correspond to a Modular Tensor Category, i.e. requiring them is a necessary but not sufficient condition. This raises the question whether it is possible to give a set of sufficient conditions, a problem that hasn't been settled yet. Extra necessary conditions arise from the theory of the Galois action and the trace identities to be explained later, but there are some others that we do know about, e.g. those related to the existence of Frobenius-Schur indicators. These later arise because to each simple object p of a Modular Tensor Category one can associate an analog of the classical Frobenius-Schur indicator, i.e. a quantity νp that can take on the three values - 1,0 and + 1, and which characterizes the symmetry of the tensor square of p. The crucial thing is that this indicator is fully determined by the modular representation, for one has the formula [\cite=FS]

[formula]

where M(k) = S- 1TkS for integer k. That the rhs. of Eq.([\ref=eq:FS]) can only be - 1,0 or + 1 does not follow from the properties of the matrices T and S explained above, thus it provides a set of further necessary conditions for the modular representation to correspond to some Modular Tensor Category.

This is far from being the end of the story. Having a representation of the group [formula], it is natural to ask whether its image is finite or not, i.e. if T and S generate a finite matrix group. As it turns out, this is always true, and even much more. To explain the precise result, let's recall that for a positive integer n, the principal congruence subgroup [formula] of level n consists of those elements of [formula] that are congruent to the identity matrix modulo n, i.e.

[formula]

Clearly, one has [formula], and [formula] is always a normal subgroup of [formula], being the kernel of the natural homomorphism [formula]. A subgroup of [formula] is called a congruence subgroup of level n if it contains [formula], but no [formula] for k < n.

The basic result about the kernel is that it is a congruence subgroup of level N, where N, the so-called conductor, is equal to the order of the matrix T (remember that this order is always finite) [\cite=CG2] [\cite=CMP]. As [formula] has finite index in [formula], this implies that T and S generate a finite matrix group, a homomorphic image of [formula].

An obvious question in this context is whether the conductor N could be arbitrary. One may show, using the theory of the Galois action to be explained in the next section, that N is bounded from above by a function of the number of simple objects, i.e. the dimension [formula] of the modular representation [\cite=CMP]. This upper bound plays a crucial role in attempts to enumerate systematically Modular Tensor Categories.

The Galois action

As should be clear from the previous section, the modular representation associated to a Modular Tensor Category has indeed very special features. In particular, because the simple objects provide a distinguished basis in [formula], the matrix elements of T and S have an invariant meaning, and one might ask about their arithmetic properties. This is the subject of the theory of the Galois action [\cite=BG] [\cite=CG1].

The basic idea is to look at the field F obtained by adjoining to the rationals [formula] all matrix elements of T and S. Note that, because T and S generate the image, the representation matrix of any element of [formula] will have matrix elements lying in F. From the properties of the modular representation explained in the previous section it follows that F is a finite Galois extension of [formula], whose Galois group is abelian. By the famous theorem of Kronecker-Weber, this means that F is a subfield of some cyclotomic extension of [formula], and one may even show that [formula], where N denotes the conductor and ζN is a primitive N-th root of unity. By known results of algebraic number theory, this means that the Galois group [formula] is isomorphic to the group [formula] of prime residues mod N, the action of [formula] corresponding to [formula] being determined by

[formula]

As all matrix elements of T and S belong to F by definition, one may ask which matrix one gets by applying σl to T and S element-wise. In case of T the result is simply

[formula]

because T is diagonal, and its diagonal entries are all powers of ζN. In case of S the result reads [\cite=CG1]

[formula]

where the orthogonal and monomial matrices Gl form a representation of the group [formula], i.e.

[formula]

Monomiality of the Gl-s means that they have just one non-zero entry in each row and column, which is either + 1 or - 1 by orthogonality.

But this is not the end of the story, for one may show [\cite=CMP] that

[formula]

relating the Galois action on S and T via the matrices Gl. This result has many important consequences, for example it implies the upper bound, explained at the end of the previous section, for the conductor in terms f the number of simple objects. Another important consequence is that it allows to express [\cite=CG2] [\cite=Bauer] the matrices Gl in terms of S and T:

[formula]

where m denotes the inverse of l in [formula]. In particular, the group generated by the matrices T and S is invariant under the Galois transformations σl.

The projective kernel

Recall from section [\ref=sec:The-modular-representation] that the kernel of the modular representation is a congruence subgroup of level N, i.e. it contains [formula], where N is the order of the matrix T. It is natural to ask whether one could give a more precise description of this subgroup. As it turns out, the really interesting object is not the kernel itself, but the projective kernel [formula], i.e. the subgroup of [formula] elements that are represented by scalar multiples of the identity matrix, and for this one has a nice description [\cite=projker]. To explain it, we have to introduce some more notions. First of all, let K denote the projective order of T, i.e. the smallest positive integer such that TK belongs to the projective kernel [formula]. Clearly, K is a divisor of the conductor N, and one may even show [\cite=CMP] that the ratio e = N / K is a divisor of 12 (all divisors of 12 arise this way, but for a given value of e one gets restrictions on K, e.g. K has to be odd if 4 divides e). Next, consider

[formula]

which is a subgroup of [formula] - actually it is a subgroup of exponent 2, as a corollary of Eq.([\ref=eq:Gcomm]). Note that we don't need to know [formula] in order to determine K and [formula], we just have to check whether the relevant matrices are multiples of the identity. To [formula] is associated the subgroup

[formula]

of [formula], and it is pretty easy to show that [formula] is always a subgroup of the projective kernel [formula].

A more involved argument leads to the result that the index [formula] is either 1 or 2. The common case is when the index is 1, i.e. [formula]. The index 2 case is related to the existence of so-called Galois currents [\cite=projker], which are subtle symmetries of the modular representation, but is very rare (in this case the ratio e = N / K has to be odd, and K a multiple of 16). But even in this last case one has canonical representatives of the non-trivial [formula] coset, i.e. the elements of the projective kernel are known explicitly in terms of K and the subgroup [formula], which are easy to determine.

Trace identities

Up to now we have been concerned with the properties of the modular representation, i.e. the first term of the tower [formula] of mapping class group modules. As we'll see in the present section, this first term does determine the subsequent terms to a great extent.

The underlying idea is that a Modular Tensor Category associates to each closed 3-manifold a number, called its partition function, which is a topological invariant, i.e. it is the same for homeomorphic manifolds [\cite=Witten] [\cite=Turaev]. While it is in general a difficult problem to determine the value of this topological invariant for a given 3-manifold, there are some classes of manifolds where the answer is known [\cite=Freed] [\cite=Rozansky].

One such class of 3-manifolds are mapping tori. These arise through the following construction: one starts with a closed surface Sg of genus g, and one forms its Cartesian product with the unit interval [formula]. The resulting 3-manifold [formula] is not closed, having two boundary components, each homeomorphic to Sg. Identifying these two boundary components via some self-homeomorphism φ of Sg one obtains a closed 3-manifold called the mapping torus of φ. As it turns out, mapping tori of maps belonging to the same mapping class are homeomorphic, i.e. the above construction assigns to each mapping class in φ∈Γg a 3-manifold Mφ, which is well-defined up to homeomorphism.

Given a Modular Tensor Category with associated sequence [formula] of mapping class group modules and a mapping class φ∈Γg, the partition function of the mapping torus Mφ is nothing but the trace [formula] of φ on the corresponding module [formula].

Another class of 3-manifolds of interest to us are the so-called Seifert-manifolds. They have several equivalent characterizations, but the following one seems the best suited for our purposes: we start again with a closed surface Sg, but first we cut out from this surface n > 0 non-overlapping disks, resulting in a surface S*g. We then take the product of this surface with the circle S1, which results in a 3-manifold S*g  ×  S1, which is not closed, its boundary consisting of n disjoint 2-tori. We obtain a closed 3-manifold by pasting in solid tori to each of these boundary components, where the pasting is characterized by a sequence [formula], with each mi being a self-homeomorphism of the corresponding 2 dimensional torus. Once again, the homeomorphism type of the resulting 3-manifold does only depend on the mapping class of the mi-s, i.e. on the corresponding sequence of [formula] elements. In this way we construct the Seifert-manifold [formula], where g and n are positive integers, while [formula]. Using Dehn-surgery, one may show that the partition function of the Seifert-manifold [formula] equals

[formula]

where [formula] stands for the matrix elements of [formula] in the distinguished basis of [formula].

All this told, the point is to recognize that there is an overlap between the class of Seifert-manifolds and mapping tori [\cite=Jgeo]: a mapping torus Mφ is homeomorphic to a suitable Seifert-manifold [formula] if and only if the mapping class φ has finite order [\cite=Hempel]. Moreover, for a given φ∈Γg of finite order, the integer g* and the sequence [formula] may be determined from the properties of the branched cover Sg  →  Sg  /  φ*, where φ* denotes the lift of the mapping class φ to an automorphism of the surface Sg. Eq.([\ref=seifert]) means that, for mapping classes φ∈Γg of finite order, the trace of φ over the Γg module [formula] may be expressed as an algebraic combination of modular matrix elements, in other words the [formula] module [formula] does completely determine the restriction of the representations [formula] to any finite subgroup of Γg.

In particular, for the identity mapping class of Γg, whose trace equals obviously the dimension of [formula], one gets the celebrated formula of Verlinde [\cite=MS]

[formula]

Let's look now at the Γ1 module [formula]. Finite order elements of [formula] are all conjugate to a power of either [formula] or [formula]. Performing the above sketched analysis, one arrives at the expression

[formula]

for the trace of the operator representing [formula] on the space [formula], where [formula], as before. But this operator is represented by the matrix S, whose trace is just the sum of its diagonal elements, i.e.

[formula]

According to the above, the two expressions Eqs.([\ref=eq:Strace1]) and ([\ref=eq:Strace2]) should be equal, providing a fairly nontrivial consistency requirement on the matrix elements of the modular representation [\cite=Jgeo] [\cite=BV]. A similar analysis applied to the other finite order elements of [formula] yields more nontrivial restrictions.

Summary

The structure of a Modular Tensor Category, which formalizes the notion of the Moore-Seiberg data of Rational Conformal Field Theory, is pretty nice and intricate. We have tried to give an overview of some of the results related to the tower of mapping class group modules. Most of these results were concerned with the properties of the modular representation, i.e. the first term of the tower. Already at this level we can see some beautiful structures emerging, e.g. the Galois action on modular matrices. Even more intriguing is the way the modular representation influences the structure of the higher genus terms of the tower, as explained in section [\ref=sec:Trace-identities].

All these results seem to indicate that we are still far from the end of the story, and that their are plenty of niceties to unravel. A major issue is to find effective computational tools to deal with Modular Tensor Categories and to enumerate them systematically. Needless to say, there's still much work to be done to get a better understanding of the subject.
