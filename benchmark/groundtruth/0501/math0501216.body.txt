Abstract. Some identities of Chebyshev polynomials are deduced from Waring's formula on symmetric functions. In particular, these formulae generalize some recent results of Grabner and Prodinger.

Introduction

Given a set of variables [formula], the kth (k  ≥  0) elementary symmetric polynomial ek(X) is defined by e0(X) = 1,

[formula]

and the kth (k  ≥  0)power sum symmetric polynomial pk(X) is defined by p0(X) = 1,

[formula]

Let [formula] be a partition of n, i.e., [formula], where mi  ≥  0 for [formula]. Set [formula]. According to the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials, any symmetric polynomial can be written uniquely as a polynomial of elementary symmetric polynomials ei(X) (i  ≥  0). In particular, for the power sum pk(x), the corresponding formula is usually attributed to Waring [\cite=CLY] [\cite=Mac] and reads as follows:

[formula]

where the sum is over all the partitions [formula] of k.

In a recent paper [\cite=GP] Grabner and Prodinger proved some identities about Chebyshev polynomials using generating functions, the aim of this paper is to show that Waring's formula provides a natural generalization of such kind of identities.

Let Un and Vn be two sequences defined by the following recurrence relations:

[formula]

Hence Un and Vn are rescaled versions of the first and second kind of Chebyshev polynomials Un(x) and Tn(x), respectively:

[formula]

For integers m,n  ≥  0, let Wn = aUn + bVn and Ω = a2 + 4b2 - b2p2. Then the following identity holds

[formula]

where

[formula]

Note that the identities of Grabner and Prodinger [\cite=GP] correspond to the m = 1 and implicitly m = 2 cases of Theorem 1 (cf. Section 3).

Proof of Theorem 1

We first check the k = 1 case of ([\ref=eq:wm]):

[formula]

Set [formula] and [formula] then it is easy to see that

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

where A = b + a / (α  -  β) and B = b - a / (α  -  β). Therefore

[formula]

which is readily seen to be equal to W2n + W2n + m.

Next we take the alphabet X = {W2n,W2n + m}, then the left-hand side of ([\ref=eq:wm]) is the power sum pk(X). On the other hand, since

[formula]

the summation at the right-hand side of ([\ref=war]) reduces to the partitions λ = (1k - 2j  2j), with j  ≥  0. Now, using ([\ref=fund]) Waring's formula ([\ref=war]) infers that

[formula]

Setting k - i = r and exchanging the order of summations yields ([\ref=eq:wm]).   -2pt

Some special cases

When m = 1 or 2, as U1 = 1, V1 = p and U2 = p, V2 = p2 - 2 the coefficient θk,r(r) of Theorem 1 is much simpler.

We have

[formula]

We notice that ([\ref=coeff1]) is exactly the formula given by Grabner and Prodinger [\cite=GP] for θk,r(1), while for θk,r(2) they give a more involved formula than ([\ref=coeff2]) as follows:

There holds

[formula]

In order to identify ([\ref=coeff2]) and ([\ref=coeffGP]), we need the following identity.

We have

[formula]

Now, expanding the right-hand side of ([\ref=coeff2]) by binomial formula yields

[formula]

Writing λ = r - i, so λ  ≤  r  ≤  k, and exchanging the order of summations, the above quantity becomes

[formula]

which yields ([\ref=coeffGP]) by applying Lemma [\ref=key].
