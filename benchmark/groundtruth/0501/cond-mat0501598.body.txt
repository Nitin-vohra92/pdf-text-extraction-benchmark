History of the BCS to Bose-Einstein Transition

Although I am partially rectifying the situation by sending photocopies of a 1969 paper of mine1 to at least one author of papers I notice which state incorrectly or imply that the crossover between BCS and Bose-Einstein condensation theory was first studied by Leggett in 1980, there is still no general awareness of my work on this topic published eleven years earlier. An example of a paper which implies incorrect history is that by Kleppner in a recent "Physics Today".2

In the mid 1980's, colleagues of mine in Australia and myself also found the first example of a system which lay on the Bose-gas side of the BCS-Bose gas transition, in a ceramic sample of 3% Zr-doped SrTiO3,3 - 5 although with a pairing temperature much lower than that predicted for the model used for this material in 1969. In three dimensions there is a threshold in the coupling strength for the existence of Bose-gas superconductivity at very low carrier concentrations, and, for strengths slightly above the threshold, the pair binding energy is proportional to the square of the difference of the coupling from the threshold value. Thus, for example, an error in calculated coupling giving a value 5% above threshold instead of 1% above threshold would make a factor of 25 error in the pair binding energy.

An attempt was made later6 to reach the Bose-gas régime in macrocrystalline samples of Zr-doped SrTiO3 with similar carrier concentrations (~  1015cm- 3 at low temperatures) to those in the ceramic sample mentioned, but, unfortunately, in this case some non-uniform state formed, and prevented the Bose-gas régime being reached. However, there is still much interesting physics awaiting study in this material.
