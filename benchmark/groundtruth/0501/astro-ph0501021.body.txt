Long-range interactions between dark-matter particles in a model with a cosmological, spontaneously-broken chiral symmetry

In this note, we point out the strength, and certain possible physical consequences, of coherent long-range interactions which can exist only between dark-matter particles. These interactions arise naturally in a model with a cosmological, spontaneously-broken chiral symmetry [\cite=ref1] [\cite=ref2]. There have been a number of speculations about such forces. For example, one motivation [\cite=ref3] has been to try to find a physical role for massless fields (dilatons) which exist in certain hypothetical, popular theories. Another recent speculation has been motivated [\cite=ref4] more directly, by certain empirical facts concerning galactic, and inter-galactic structure, which may conflict with the results of simulations carried out in the standard cosmological model (ΛCDM). As we point out below, results of our present investigation based upon a specific dynamical model, have marked analogies to these phenomenological considerations. [\cite=ref4].

In the chiral field theory [\cite=ref5] [\cite=ref6], there is a self-interaction term λ(φ2 + b2)2. There is a spontaneous symmetry breaking at a very high energy scale [formula], the Planck mass. We have identified φ with a scalar inflaton field. [\cite=ref1] [\cite=ref2] Identification with the inflaton allows us to fix a dimensionless parameter [formula], essentially empirically, [\cite=ref7] [\cite=ref8] from the observed CMB fluctuations. The definite, unusual result is that one possible dark-matter particle is at a very high mass, [formula], for φc  ~  1018  .[\cite=ref2] This is also an implicit result of the phenomenology in ref. 4, where a classical scalar, (dark-energy) field with present magnitude of the order of MP is coupled linearly to a fermionic, dark-matter field (unless the dimensionless coupling parameter, denoted by y there [\cite=ref4], is miniscule).

A new dynamical element which we introduced [\cite=ref1], is a further spontaneous symmetry breaking through a non-zero vacuum expectation value for the pseudoscalar b field, [formula]. Thus, CP invariance is spontaneously broken. The low energy scale is independently fixed by a coupling of the b field to a neutrino (in particular, to the heaviest ordinary neutrino, presumably ντ). This neutrino then acquires a mass of [formula], for a typical gν  ~  10- 2 [\cite=ref2]. Two further results follow from the model.

There is a natural possibility for generation of a significant ([formula]) antineutrino-neutrino asymmetry in the early universe, as a consequence of CP noninvariance [\cite=ref1].

There is a residual vacuum energy density with a magnitude of [formula], which can be identified with an effective cosmological constant [\cite=ref1]. (See Appendix.)

As a result of Fb  ≠  0, the self-interaction acquires trilinear coupling terms, 4λFb3 and 4λFbφ̃2, where we denote the particle quanta of the φ and b fields by φ̃ and [formula]. These terms give rise to coherent long-range interactions, as illustrated in Fig. 1 for a pair of b particles. Below we give the effective, attractive (Yukawa) potentials between a b pair, a φ-b pair, and a φ pair, where the interacting particles are assumed to be nearly static i. e. with a very small, intrinsic relative velocity. At distances within 1 / mb, with the exponential factor of order unity, we compare these attractive potentials (with φc  ~  0.1MP [\cite=ref2], Fb  ~  5.5   [\cite=ref1], [formula]) to the corresponding potentials from gravity: We have written the gravitational constant [formula]. Clearly, for b-b the effective coupling strength in (1a), λ / 8π, is much greater than the 8λ(Fb / MP)2 in (2a). The strengths in (1b) and (2b) are comparable. For φ-φ, the gravitational strength in (2c) is much greater than that in (1c). An important comparison of strengths is between the new potential between a pair of very light, dark-matter b particles in (1a), and the gravitational potential between a pair of very heavy, dark-matter particles in (2c). The ratio of (1a) to (2c) is independent of the coupling parameter λ; it is simply [formula]. This is much like the result of the phenomenology in ref. 4; Eq. (18) there gives a ratio of a "fifth" force in the dark sector to the gravitational force, as 1 / 4πGφ2, where φ is a (time-varying) dark-energy field with present magnitude [formula].

For a mass [formula], the range for the interaction of a pair of b particles is ~  1 / mb  ~  10  . The cross section for elastic scattering of an isolated pair, with very small, intrinsic relative velocity, is simply σ  =  λ2 / 16πm2b  ~  1   (up to approximately [formula] with enhancement from the square of a combinatorial factor). Note the compensation of the small factor λ2 by the small mass in the dimensional factor 1 / m2b. To possibly have effects upon structure within a galactic dimension, the number density of such light particles must be very large. One likely effect is the formation of very massive dark-matter cores at the very center of many galaxies [\cite=ref9] [\cite=ref10]. At larger distances from the center, other possible structure effects have been the subject of conflicting claims, made under certain assumptions concerning collision cross sections and the motion of the dark-matter particles [\cite=ref11] [\cite=ref12] [\cite=ref13] [\cite=ref14]. It is noteworthy that if there was relativistic motion of b with momentum p > mb in the earliest epoch of structure formation, a relevant σ reduced by [formula] still allows for a mean free path then less than 1 pc.

We consider the possibility that the b mass is much smaller, but greater than the present Hubble parameter, and that the b particles are essentially a zero-momentum condensate, with (galactic) number density similar to that for the massive φ. If the potential from Fig. 1 extends to distances between galaxy groups, then the coherence factor for all b particles is similar to (possibly even greater than) that for all φ particles. From the potentials in (1a) and (2c), the coherent effect of the new long-range force between b dark matter is comparable to gravitation between φ dark matter (which dark matter gives the dominant contribution to the total, near-critical energy density).

In summary, the idea discussed here is that it is possible that dark matter has both a very massive and a very light particle content. With spontaneous breaking of CP invariance, the self-interaction of these dark-matter bosons can naturally generate attractive, coherent long-range potentials, which can augment the gravitational attraction between concentrations of large numbers of dark-matter particles.

Again, we thank Prof. P. J. E. Peebles for his encouraging communications.

Appendix

In the model with a cosmological, chiral symmetry [\cite=ref1], the magnitude of the residual vacuum energy density is estimated to be |ρΛ|  ~  | - λF4b|  ~  2.7  ×  10- 47  4, with λ and Fb determined independently from the measured CMB fluctuations and from (a largest) ordinary neutrino mass, respectively. In order to have a positive effective cosmological constant, it is possible to consider an additional "gravitational" contribution of the form [\cite=ref15] [\cite=ref16] ( - 1 / 48)FμνσρFμνσρ where [formula], as introduced in the Lagrangian density by Duff and van Nieuwenhuizen [\cite=ref15]. The essential new hypothesis here, is that the scale of the constant [formula]; then the contribution to the vacuum energy density is (1 / 4)(mbFb)2  =  2λF4b. The total vacuum energy density equivalent to an effective cosmological constant is +  λF4b. It is assumed that the additional contribution occurs in time only after the minimum of the effective potential is reached at b = Fb, and so a stable, non-zero mass [formula]. (The additional contribution is not negative as in [\cite=ref16], where Fμνσρ is taken as purely imaginary because it is used to cancel an assumed positive vacuum energy density of unknown origin.) There is the possibility here of a unification of dark energy and dark matter, since b particles may constitute the latter.
