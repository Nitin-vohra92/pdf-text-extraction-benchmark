Multipartite entangled states, symmetric matrices and error-correcting codes

Introduction

Quantum entanglement appears in many areas of quantum information theory including quantum communications [\cite=Be1993] [\cite=Be1996] [\cite=Sch1995], quantum computing [\cite=Joz1997] [\cite=Joz2002] [\cite=Vir2005] and quantum key distribution [\cite=Koa2004]. Quantum entanglement theory is developed to determine which states are entangled and which are separable. In bipartite entanglement, the simplest is quantum bipartite pure state. To determine whether this pure state is separable, we just diagonalize its reduced density matrix. But it is still NP-hard to determine separability in bipartite system [\cite=Gur]. In general problem of multipartite entanglement, besides separability and entanglement, there are many types of partial separability which complicates this problem. Although there are some attempts to detect genuine multipartite entanglement [\cite=Hub1] [\cite=Hub2], there are still many open problems in this area.

One of the intriguing problem is to investigate highly entangled states of several qubits[\cite=Gis] [\cite=Hig] [\cite=Ken] [\cite=Brow] [\cite=Ost] [\cite=Bor] [\cite=Br] [\cite=Mar] [\cite=Tam]. In [\cite=Fac1] [\cite=Fac2], they considered the one qubit reduced state which is maximally mixed. This idea was further developed by Arnaud and Cerf [\cite=Arn]. They proposed the concept of k-multipartite maximally entangled pure states or k-uniform for short, i.e., any k-partite reduced state is maximally mixed.

It was shown in [\cite=Sc] that an n-qudit pure quantum state |Φ〉 of level d is k-uniform if and only if |Φ〉 is a pure ((n,1,k + 1))d quantum error-correcting code. Using this connection the author was able to construct some k-uniform pure quantum states through stabilizer quantum codes obtained from classical self-dual codes. In [\cite=DA], a connection between k-uniform pure quantum states and orthogonal arrays was established and several classes of k-uniform states were constructed. More precisely speaking, the following result were obtained in [\cite=DA].

There exist k-uniform (d + 1)-qudits states of d levels whenever d  ≥  2 and [formula].

There exist 2-uniform n-qudits states of 2 levels whenever [formula].

There exist 3-uniform (2m + 2)-qudits states of 2m levels whenever [formula].

There exist 2m - 1-uniform (2m + 2)-qudits states of 2m levels whenever m = 2 or 4.

In addition, some k-uniform n-qudits states of d levels were also given for some small values of k,n,d. The above special values of the parameters k,n,d are obtained due to constraint from combinatorial structure of orthogonal arrays.

In this paper, we first provide an equivalent definition for k-uniform quantum states through a map from [formula] to the complex numbers [formula]. Based on this equivalent definition, we first derive a construction of k-uniform quantum states by using symmetric matrices. Again starting from this equivalent definition, we present the second construction that makes use of classical error-correcting codes with good minimum distance and dual distance. There are three main results arising from our constructions. Firstly, we show that for any given even [formula], there always exists an n / 2-uniform n-qudit quantum state of level p for sufficiently large prime p. Secondly, both constructions show that their exist k-uniform n-qudit pure quantum states such that k is proportional to n, i.e., k = Ω(n) although the construction from symmetric matrices outperforms the one by error-correcting codes. Thirdly, our symmetric matrix construction provides a positive answer to the open question in [\cite=DA] on whether there exists 3-uniform n-qudit pure quantum states for all [formula]. In fact, we can further prove that, for every k, there exists a constant Mk such that there exists a k-uniform n-qudit quantum state for all [formula]. In addition, by using concatenation of algebraic geometry codes, we give an explicit construction of k-uniform quantum state when k tends to infinity. Both numeric and theoretic results reveal that the matrix construction is in general better than the one by classical error-correcting codes.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce basic definition of k-uniform quantum states and present an equivalent definition. By this equivalent definition, we propose two different constructions of k-uniform quantum states in Section 3. In Section 4, we investigate the case where n is small by presenting some tables and a few other results. In the last section, we discuss the case where n tends to infinity, i.e., its asymptotic behavior through our construction. In addition, in this section we also provide an explicit construction of k-uniform quantum states based on our construction through error-correcting codes.

Preliminaries on k-uniform quantum state

Definition

A k-uniform n-qudit quantum state has the property that, after tracing out all but k qudits, we are left with the maximally mixed state for any k-tuple of qudits. This means that all information about the system is lost after removal of n - k or more parties. Precisely speaking, a pure quantum state of n subsystems of level d is called k-uniform (or k-maximally entangled) if every reduction to k qudits is maximally mixed. Let us give a mathematical definition.

The density matrix of a quantum state [formula] is defined by [formula]. For a subset A of [formula] and a vector [formula], we denote by [formula] the projection of [formula] at A. The reduction of |Φ〉 to A has the density matrix [formula], where Ā is the complement set of A (i.e., [formula]) and [formula] is defined to be 1 if [formula] and 0 otherwise.

The well-known Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states belong to the class 1-uniform, while W states do not belong to any class of k-uniform states. For a state |Φ〉, a multipartite entanglement measures Qk(|Φ〉) was defined [\cite=Sc]. The original Meyer-Wallach measure Q1(|Φ〉) is actually the average entanglement between individual qudits and the rest. As k increases, Qk(|Φ〉) is getting more sensitive to correlations of an increasingly global nature. Qk(|Φ〉) is upper bounded by 1. It was proved in [\cite=Sc] that |Φ〉 is k-uniform if and only if Qk(|Φ〉) = 1.

An equivalent definition

An n-qudit quantum state [formula] of level d is associated with a map φ from [formula] to [formula] given by [formula]. This means that n-qudit quantum states of level d are identified with maps from [formula] to [formula]. Thus, an n-qudit state |Φ〉 can be written as [formula] for a given function φ. A k-uniform quantum state can be described in terms of its associated map φ.

An n-qudit state [formula] is k-uniform if and only if

φ is not identical to zero.

For any subset A of [formula] with |A| = k, and every [formula], one has

[formula]

Constructions of k-uniform quantum states

Before starting our first construction, we prove a lemma.

Let [formula] be an integer. Let [formula] be m integers. Assume that [formula]. Then for every [formula] the equation [formula] has exactly edm - 1 solutions in [formula].

Based on Lemma [\ref=lm:1], we first provide a construction of k-uniform quantum state through symmetric matrices. Our map φ is in fact a quadratic function. Let ζd denote a dth primitive root of unity in [formula]. For two subsets [formula] and a matrix [formula], we denote by HA  ×  B the submatrix (hij)i∈A,j∈B. An n  ×  n matrix E over [formula] is called invertible if there exists an n  ×  n matrix G over [formula] such that EG = GE is equal to the identity matrix. It is well known that E is invertible if and only if the determinate of E is co-prime with d. If E is invertible, then for any nonzero vector [formula], we must have [formula]. Otherwise, one would have [formula].

If there is a zero diagonal symmetric matrix [formula] such that for any subset A of [formula] with |A| = k, there exists a subset B of Ā with |B| = k such that the submatrix HA  ×  B is a k  ×  k invertible matrix over [formula] , then the n-qudit state [formula] is k-uniform with [formula], where [formula] with [formula] for i < j and 0 otherwise.

If d is a prime p, then the condition in Theorem [\ref=thm:a1] can be simplified.

Let p be a prime. If there is a zero diagonal symmetric matrix [formula] such that for any subset A of [formula] with |A| = k, the submatrix HA  ×  Ā has rank k, then the n-qudit state [formula] is k-uniform with [formula], where [formula] with [formula] for i < j and 0 otherwise.

The second construction applies Lemma [\ref=lm:1] to linear codes with good minimum distance and dual distance. As our classical codes are defined over prime fields [formula], we consider level p only for primes p for the following constrution.

If C is a p-ary linear code of length n. Let d and [formula] be the minimum distance of C and its Euclidean dual [formula], respectively. If [formula], then [formula] is k-uniform n-qudit quantum state of level p.

If there exists a p-ary

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=thm:2] provides an explicit construction of k-uniform quantum states . We give an example below.

The case where n is small

For given d and n, one natural question is what is the maximal k such that there exists a k-uniform n-qudit quantum state of level d. This question motivates the following definition.

One obvious upper bound on kd(n) is n / 2. In this section, we will study some lower bounds on kd(n) by constructing k-uniform n-qudit quantum states of level d via our results in Section 3. We discuss the cases for small d and large d separately. Although our matrix construction works well for composite levels d, for simplicity we only consider the case where d = p is a prime number.

By Theorem [\ref=thm:1], in order to construct a k-uniform quantum state, it is sufficient to find an n  ×  n zero-diagonal matrix H satisfying that HA  ×  Ā has rank k for any subset A of [formula] with |A| = k. Through the random matrix counting, we provide a sufficient condition for existence of such a matrix.

The number of n  ×  n zero-diagonal matrices H over [formula] satisfying that HA  ×  Ā has rank k for any subset A of [formula] with |A| = k is at least

[formula]

If the triple (n,k,p) satisfies [formula], then there exists a k-uniform n-qudit quantum state of level p.

Small k

In [\cite=Sc], it was proved that for any [formula], there exists a 2-uniform n-qudit quantum state of level 2. By using the above corollary, we can extend this results largely. For instance, we have the following result.

For any prime p, there exists an integer Mk such that for any [formula], one can construct a k-uniform n-qudit of level p. Furthermore, one has the following quantum states.

For any [formula] and integer [formula], there exists a 3-uniform n-qudit quantum state of level p.

For any [formula], there exists a 4-uniform n-qudit quantum state of level p.

For any [formula], there exists a 5-uniform n-qudit quantum state of level p.

p = 2,3,5,7

Through computer search, we are able to find some lower bounds on kd(n). Due to our computation limitation, n is limited to 24 or smaller. Table I provides lower bounds on kp(n) via construction of Theorem [\ref=thm:1]. The entries with "-" in Table I means that our computation limit does not allow us to find a reasonable lower bound on the corresponding kp(n).

Table I

Table I provides lower bounds kp(n) only for prime levels p. As our Theorem [\ref=thm:a1] works well for composite levels d, we give another table showing lower bounds kd(n) for d = 4,6,8 and 9. Due to our computation limitation, we compute kd(n) only up to n = 10.

Table II

In addition, we provide one matrix that gives a 3-uniform 6-qudit quantum states of level 2. As our construction in Theorem [\ref=thm:1] is explicit, the quantum state can be explicitly written down as long as the corresponding matrix is known.

[formula]

The corresponding quantum state for the above matrix is

[formula]

The following Table III shows lower bounds on kd(n) via our Corollary [\ref=cor:1] and Theorem [\ref=thm:2]. Some of entries in Table III are obtained via Corollary [\ref=cor:1] from those best-known self-dual codes in the online table [\cite=GO], while some others are obtained from Theorem [\ref=thm:2] through algebraic geometry codes and computer search. In particular, all entries for p = 7 are obtained from algebraic geometry codes. Note that in Table III some entries on kp(n) for odd n are computed from Corollary [\ref=cor:1](ii).

Table III

Large level p

The main purpose of this subsection is to prove that, for any given even n, we have kp(n) = n / 2 for sufficiently large prime p.

For any given even integer [formula], if an odd prime p satisfies [formula], then kp(n) = n / 2.

The case where n is large

For a fixed [formula], to see how kd(n) varies as n tends to infinity, we define the following asymptotic quantity.

Obviously, λd  ≤  1 / 2. Again, we will study some lower bounds on λd by constructing k-uniform n-qudit quantum states of level d via our results in Section 3. In addition, we give existence bounds and constructive bounds on λd separately. As one can expect, constructive bounds are usually worse than existence bounds.

Existence bounds on λp

We first provide an existence bound via Lemma [\ref=lm:2]. For any integer [formula], the d-ary entropy function is defined by

[formula]

By Stirling's formula, we have

[formula]

Let λ be a root of the equation H2(x) = (1 - 2x) log 2p. Then [formula].

Based on Theorem [\ref=thm:4], we provide a table for lower bounds on λp for small p below.

Table IV

Next let us derive a lower bound on λp from self-dual codes via Corollary [\ref=cor:1].

One has

[formula]

where H- 1p(y) is the inverse function of Hp(x).

Based on Theorem [\ref=thm:5], we provide a table for lower bounds on λp for small p below.

Table V

Constructive bounds on λp

It is well known that there always exists a trace-orthogonal basis of GF(pr) over [formula] [\cite=MP]. Note that if [formula] is a trace-orthogonal basis of GF(pr) over [formula], then Tr(α2i)  ≠  0 for all [formula]. Otherwise, one would have Tr(αix) = 0 for all x∈GF(pr) which is impossible.

Now we fix a trace-orthogonal basis [formula] of GF(pr) over [formula]. Let ai denote Tr(α2i). Then [formula]. Thus, every element of β of GF(pr) can be written as a linear combination [formula] with [formula]. We denote by π(α) and [formula] the vectors [formula] and [formula], respectively. Extend π and [formula] to the maps from GF(pr)n to [formula] given by

[formula]

Let C be a linear code of length n over GF(pr). If [formula] is the dual code of C, then [formula] is the dual code of [formula].

It is a well-known result from algebraic geometry codes that, for any prime power q, there exists a family of q2-ary

[formula]

and [formula] (see [\cite=Stich]). Furthermore, this family can be constructed in polynomial times.

For any [formula], one has a constructive lower bound on λp given by

[formula]

When p is small, the bound given in Theorem [\ref=thm:6] can be further improved by considering algebraic geometry codes over larger extension GF(p2t) for [formula].

For any [formula], one has a constructive lower bound on λp given by

[formula]

Finally, we provide a table for constructive lower bounds on λp for primes [formula]. Note that the value t to obtain the optimal lower bound in Theorem [\ref=thm:2] may vary as p varies.

An example for k-uniform from symmetric matrix

In this appendix, we provide one more matrix that gives a 3-uniform 8-qudit quatum states of level 2. Thus, the quantum states can be explicitly written down as long as the corresponding matrix is provided by Theorem [\ref=thm:1].
