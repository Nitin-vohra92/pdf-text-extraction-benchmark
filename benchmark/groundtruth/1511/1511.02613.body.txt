Nonadditivity of Critical Casimir Forces

Introduction. From gravitation to electromagnetism, the fundamental physical interactions are additive: for instance, the force exerted on a probe electric charge in an homogeneous medium by two other charges equals the sum of the forces exerted by each of them separately. In more complex situations, however, effective interactions take hold -- and these forces are not necessarily additive [\cite=israel1992]. Accordingly, a crucial issue is whether, and to what extent, genuinely many-body effects are present. For example, from the confinement of a fluctuating field, effective long-ranged forces between two microscopic objects may result at the micrometer scale. A notable example are critical Casimir forces acting on micrometer-sized particles which are immersed in a binary liquid mixture near its critical (demixing) point confining the concentration fluctuations [\cite=fisher1978phenomena] [\cite=gambassi2009rev]. These forces are theoretically predicted to be nonadditive [\cite=mattos2013many] [\cite=mattos2015manybody] [\cite=hobrecht2015manybody], but experimental evidence for the corresponding many-body effects is still lacking. Here, we report the direct experimental measurement of such effects. Using holographic optical tweezers (HOTs) [\cite=grier2003revolution] and digital video microscopy (DVM) [\cite=crocker1996methods] [\cite=baumgartl2005limits] to probe in situ the forces acting on spherical colloids immersed in a critical mixture of water and 2,6-lutidine in various geometrical configurations, we observe that the critical Casimir force exerted on a probe colloid by two other colloids differs from the sum of the forces exerted by them separately. These many-body effects are controlled by adjusting the criticality of the mixture, e.g. by tuning its temperature or by changing the surface properties of the particles. Since interactions between microscopic particles in fluids are central to a wide spectrum of physical, chemical and biological phenomena, the insight we provide here might be useful in a diverse range of applications, including controlling microscopic self-assembly of colloids, complex collective behaviour, as well as phase and bio-mimetic behaviour of micro- and nanoparticles -- considering in particular that many-body effects are expected to become even more important on the nanoscale [\cite=batista2015nonadditivity].

Understanding and controlling the interactions of micro- and nanoscopic particles is essential for a wide range of disciplines and applications, e.g. synthesis of complex nanodevices, self-organisation processes, and engineering of collective properties of nanoparticles. In these contexts, effective forces and the associated many-body effects can play a major role in determining large-scale collective and self-organised behaviours, e.g. concerning the formation and stabilisation of nanoparticle suspensions, aggregates, colloidal molecules and photonic crystals [\cite=sacanna2010lock] [\cite=batista2015nonadditivity].

Effective long-ranged forces acting on mesoscopic objects emerge if they spatially confine a surrounding fluctuating field. QED Casimir forces are a notable example, due to the confinement of vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations between two conductors [\cite=casimir1948attraction]; these forces are typically attractive and, thus, cause undesired stiction of the metallic parts of nanodevices [\cite=capasso2007casimir]. The thermodynamic analog of QED Casimir forces are critical Casimir forces, which were theoretically predicted by Fisher and de Gennes in 1978 [\cite=fisher1978phenomena]: the confinement of thermal fluctuations in a binary liquid mixture may result in attractive or repulsive interactions, with universal features [\cite=gambassi2009critical]. These thermal fluctuations typically occur on the molecular scale; however, upon approaching a critical point of a second-order phase transition, they become relevant and correlated across a much larger (up to several microns) length scale ξ. The first direct experimental evidence for critical Casimir forces was provided only in 2008 [\cite=hertlein2008direct]: using total internal reflection microscopy (TIRM), femtonewton effective forces were experimentally measured between a single colloid and a planar surface immersed in a critical mixture; remarkably, both attractive and repulsive forces were found, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Since then, these forces have been investigated under various conditions, e.g. by varying the properties of the involved surfaces [\cite=nellen2009tunability] [\cite=gambassi2011patterns]. In addition, a number of studies of the phase behaviour of colloidal dispersions in a critical mixture [\cite=soyka2008critical] [\cite=bonn2009direct] [\cite=zvyagolskaya2011phase] [\cite=mohry2012phase] [\cite=edison2015] indicate critical Casimir forces as candidates for tuning the self-assembly of nanostructures [\cite=faber2013controlling]. In order to gain full control and possibly harness critical Casimir interactions, it is pivotal to understand to what degree many-body effects play a role. In fact, both QED and critical Casimir forces have been theoretically predicted to be nonadditive [\cite=mattos2013many] [\cite=mattos2015manybody] [\cite=hobrecht2015manybody]; however, a direct experimental evidence to support these theoretical predictions is still lacking.

Here we report a set of experiments which demonstrates and quantifies the three-body effects present in critical Casimir forces acting on colloidal microspheres immersed in a near-critical binary liquid mixture. Corresponding theoretical studies [\cite=mattos2013many] [\cite=mattos2015manybody] [\cite=hobrecht2015manybody] reveal that these effects can either increase or decrease the critical Casimir forces depending on the temperature T of the mixture, the spatial dimensionality, geometrical arrangement, shape, and distance between the involved surfaces, in a way that is difficult to rationalise but with an overall contribution which can be up to 20% of the pairwise additive interaction. Due to this rather complex dependence on a large number of geometrical and physical variables, it is a priori unclear whether this effect can be experimentally detected in colloidal suspensions.

Experimental protocol. Before getting into the experimental details, we briefly outline the strategy of the experiment. We employ a setup in which three colloidal microspheres are held by HOTs at the corners of an almost equilateral triangle. First, we measure the two-body critical Casimir forces arising, upon approaching criticality, on each of the three pairs of particles in the absence of the remaining colloid, which is temporarily moved into an auxiliary trap. Then, assuming additivity of critical Casimir forces, these measurements are used in order to predict the forces acting on a pair of particles in the presence of the third one, which is eventually brought closer. Finally, we compare this additive prediction with the actually measured three-body potential: the significant discrepancies which appear clearly demonstrate the nonadditivity of critical Casimir forces.

As solvent, we employ a mixture of water and 2,6-lutidine at the critical lutidine mass fraction ccL  =  0.286 (see the phase diagram in Fig. 1a describing a lower critical point at temperature Tc  =  306.4  K [\cite=grattoni1993lower]). A few degrees below Tc, the mixture is homogeneous and critical Casimir forces are negligible. However, as T approaches Tc (arrow in Fig. 1a), critical concentration fluctuations emerge, which generate critical Casimir forces [\cite=gambassi2009critical]. These forces depend strongly on the adsorption preferences of the surface of the particles, i.e. on whether they preferentially adsorb water or lutidine, realizing (-  ) and (+  ) boundary conditions, respectively [\cite=hertlein2008direct] [\cite=gambassi2009critical]. In particular, critical Casimir forces are attractive between two particles carrying the same boundary conditions, i.e. (+  + ) and (-  - ), while repulsive for (+  - ) and (-  + ). In the experiment we employ both hydrophilic (-  ) pristine silica spheres (diameter 2R  =  2.06  ±  0.05  μm) and hydrophobic (+  ) silica spheres obtained by treating their surfaces with octyltriemthoxysilane.

We start by considering the configuration schematically shown in Fig. 1b, with two particles, labeled by 1 and 2. These particles are subject to a one-body potential Uot due to optical traps, and a two-body contribution due to both a screened electrostatic pair repulsion Ues and a critical Casimir pair potential UC, while no evidence of van der Waals interactions was found; the total potential U2 of this configuration is therefore

[formula]

where [formula] is the position of the centre of particle i, [formula] and [formula] is the position of the centre of the i-th trap, while [formula] is the distance between the surfaces of particles i and j. The optical traps are harmonic [\cite=jones2015optical], i.e.

[formula]

where the stiffness ki (≃0.4    /  μ for the data in Figs. 1 and 3, and ≃0.8    /  μ for those in Fig. 4) is nearly the same for all traps, as discussed below. The DLVO electrostatic potential [\cite=israel1992] can be parameterised as

[formula]

where kB is the Boltzmann constant, lD (≃10  nm) is the Debye length for the solvent, and l(ij)es (≃90  nm) is a measure of the strength of the interaction between the two colloidal particles i and j, which depends, inter alia, on their charges. The mild dependence of both Uot and Ues on the temperature T can be neglected as here T is varied by at most 1%. Finally, the critical Casimir pair potential U(ij)C(dij,ξ) depends on the correlation length ξ of the critical mixture and, within the Derjaguin approximation dij  ≪  R (with [formula] in the present experiment), is given by [\cite=gambassi2009critical] [\cite=hertlein2008direct]

[formula]

where Θ(ij)(x) is the universal scaling function characterised by the boundary conditions involved, but otherwise independent of the material properties of the mixture and of the particles; it can be inferred from available numerical data [\cite=vasilyev2007monte] [\cite=hertlein2008direct] [\cite=gambassi2009critical]. The correlation length ξ varies as ξ(T)  =  ξ0(1 - T / Tc)-  ν, where the mixture-specific quantity ξ0  =  0.20  ±  0.02  nm (s.e.m.) has been determined by light scattering experiments [\cite=gulari1972light], while ν  =  0.63 is a universal critical exponent of the three-dimensional Ising universality class, holding for classical binary mixtures [\cite=gambassi2009critical]. In the presence of three particles, their total potential U3 can be decomposed into the sum of individual one-body, pairwise two-body, and remaining three-body contributions:

[formula]

where U(ij)C depends on the boundary conditions at the surfaces of the particles i and j, while U(123) is the nonadditive three-body potential, which includes the contribution U(123)C of the three-body critical Casimir potential, the existence and magnitude of which we want to assess. Note that U(123)C can be distinguished from other possible contributions (such as those due to electrostatics [\cite=brunner2004]) because of its sensitive dependence on temperature, which effectively controls also its spatial range.

Until now direct measurements of critical Casimir forces have been performed only on single particles above planar surfaces using TIRM [\cite=hertlein2008direct] [\cite=nellen2009tunability]; TIRM, however, necessarily involves a planar surface and therefore does not allow the measurement of forces arising between identical spherical particles, as they occur in colloidal suspensions. We have therefore developed an experimental setup capable of manipulating and observing multiple particles in the bulk of a critical mixture. Our setup is based on a combination of HOTs [\cite=grier2003revolution] [\cite=jones2015optical] and DVM [\cite=crocker1996methods] [\cite=baumgartl2005limits] [\cite=jones2015optical]; its schematic is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. The HOTs are realised by shaping a laser beam using a spatial light modulator; in this way, we generate multiple reconfigurable optical traps within the sample, which allow us to gently hold the colloids with nanometric accuracy in the bulk of the critical mixture, i.e. 50  μ above the lower surface of the sample cell; this distance is large enough to ensure that the critical Casimir forces between this surface and the particles are negligible. The laser power at each trapping site is kept low enough (≃2  mW) to avoid significant heating (≪  0.1  mK [\cite=jones2015optical]). The DVM uses a monochromatic CCD camera, acquiring videos at 200  fps; these frames are analysed using standard DVM algorithms in order to determine the projected positions of the particles with nanometric accuracy [\cite=crocker1996methods] [\cite=baumgartl2005limits]. The crucial temperature control of the binary mixture is achieved in two stages as described in the Methods and is able to maintain a certain temperature with an accuracy of ±  2  mK.

We perform all measurements using the same configuration of six traps, all obtained by means of the same hologram on the spatial light modulator, which produces spatially displaced but otherwise almost identical optical potentials. Three of these traps, referred to as internal ones, have their centres located at the vertices of an approximately equilateral triangle with edges of ≃2.3  μ; the centres of the remaining three traps, referred to as external ones, are instead located at a distance ≃2.3  μ from each vertex, along the bisector of the corresponding external angle (see Fig. 2). The six traps are sufficiently far apart to guarantee the independence of the optical potentials [\cite=jones2015optical]. The internal traps are used to hold either two (Figs. 2a, 2b and 2c) or three particles (Fig. 2d) for measuring the pair interaction or three-body potentials, respectively. The particles that are not needed in a certain measurement are temporarily moved from the internal to the closest of the external traps where they have negligible interactions with the other particles. In this way, the three colloids -- labeled 1, 2 and 3 -- selected at the beginning of the experiment are employed for the whole set of measurements; this eliminates possible systematic errors due to differences in the properties of the colloids of the batch we use. We start at a temperature T a few degrees below Tc, for which no critical fluctuations are present and the mixture is homogenous. First, we characterise the optical potential in Eq. ([\ref=eq:ot]) by measuring ki of each internal trap employing the configurations in Supplementary Fig. 2a: the particle under measurement (e.g. particle 1 in configuration a1) is held in an internal trap, while the other two particles (e.g. particles 2 and 3 in configuration a1) are moved into the nearest external traps. Then, by holding each pair (i.e. 1-2, 1-3 and 2-3) of particles in the respective internal traps while keeping the third particle (i.e. 3, 2 and 1, respectively) in the corresponding external trap, we measure and characterise the electrostatic interaction in Eq. ([\ref=eq:dlvo]) between each possible pair of particles, using the configurations shown in Figs. 2a, 2b and 2c, respectively. Finally, we measure the three-body interactions by having all three colloids in the internal traps as shown in Fig. 2d. At temperatures much lower than Tc, we obtain additivity of the interactions (in particular, of the electrostatic one) as expected. We then increase T in small steps towards Tc and we repeat the measurement of the pair and three-body interactions at each step. The details of the measurement cycle are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2b.

Experimental results. For each value of T, we acquire the histogram of the probability distribution P2(l12) of the in-plane surface-to-surface distance l12 between the particles 1 and 2 (see Supplementary Fig. 3a and Methods for the definition of l12) from which we infer the effective potential [formula] shown by the symbols in Fig. 1c, for various values of the correlation length ξ determined as described below. The solid lines in Fig. 1c represent, instead, the theoretical predictions based on Eq. ([\ref=eq:U2]) obtained via a Monte Carlo integration of the Boltzmann factor [formula] (see the Methods for additional details) where the only fitting parameter is ξ, because the optical and the electrostatic potentials have already been characterised at low T (see above). Note that the indicated values of ξ have been determined by a best fit to a part of the experimental data (highlighted by darker colours in the histograms in Supplementary Figs. 3) and are the same for the three pairs of particles as ξ only depends on the temperature of the mixture. We obtain a very good agreement between the measured and the theoretical effective potential for all three pairs of particles (Supplementary Figs. 3a, 3b and 3c). This demonstrates that Eq. ([\ref=eq:C2]) properly describes the two-body critical Casimir interaction U(12)C, which is responsible for the formation of the dip in U2(l12) at l12≃80   and which appears as ξ increases. In addition, this agreement provides the direct experimental evidence of the occurrence of critical Casimir forces between two spherical colloidal particles, which is a geometrical configuration which had not been previously explored. Note that U2(l12) at separations [formula] is essentially determined by Uot, while for [formula] it is strongly influenced by the short-distance behaviour of Ues which might not be accurately captured by Eq. ([\ref=eq:dlvo]). Accordingly, the range of l12 relevant for assessing the comparison between theory and experiment and the emergence of (possibly many-body) critical Casimir forces extends from the bottom of the dip to its right.

At this point, we can predict the effective potential U3(l12) associated with the distribution P3(l12) of the in-plane distance between particles 1 and 2 in the presence of particle 3 (Fig. 2d) by using the measured two-body interactions and assuming additivity, i.e. [formula] in Eq. ([\ref=eq:U3]). Again, these theoretical predictions are computed numerically via a Monte Carlo integration of the Boltzmann factor [formula] (see the Methods for additional details). The resulting effective potential U3(l12) between particles 1 and 2 is indicated by the solid lines in Fig. 3, while symbols are the corresponding experimental data: the clear discrepancy between the two provides evidence for the presence of nonadditive (many-body) effects. The data with the smallest ξ departs appreciably from additivity at short distances [formula] due to a short-ranged electrostatic three-body effect which reduces repulsion [\cite=brunner2004] and therefore amplifies the effects of the two-body critical Casimir attraction. On the contrary, as ξ increases, the effective potential is less attractive than expected, indicating that such a reduction is due to the many-body critical Casimir interaction U(123)C, especially for l12 between 70 and 250 nm, where the two- and three-body electrostatics effects are negligible.

As pointed out above, one of the most distinguished features of the two-body critical Casimir forces is that their attractive or repulsive character depends on the surface properties only of the particles. While the experiment described above involves three hydrophilic particles (-  -  - ), we repeated the experiment with one hydrophobic (3) and two hydrophilic (1, 2) particles (-  -  + ), with the results shown in Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 4. Also in this case we observe good agreement between theory and experiment for the pair-interaction effective potentials U2(lij) which can be inferred from the histograms of the corresponding distribution P2(lij) (see Supplementary Figs. 4a, 4b and 4c), while sizeable discrepancies emerge in the three-body potential U3(l12) (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 4d). In contrast to the previous case, the experimental data demonstrate that, depending on the distance and the correlation length, many-body effects may also deepen the critical Casimir potential between particles 1 and 2. The experiments described above typically correspond to values of the scaling variables R / ξ≃100 and lij / R≃0.1 which are outside the ranges of the available theoretical predictions for the many-body effects [\cite=mattos2015manybody]: their highly nontrivial dependence on temperature and geometrical features renders any attempt questionable to extrapolate and therefore to compare these predictions with the present experimental data. Interestingly enough, assuming for U(123)C the simple functional form of the Axilrod-Teller three-atom potential which describes three-body corrections to the van der Waals interaction (see, e.g. Ref. [\cite=mattos2015manybody]), with a suitable choice of the overall amplitude, reduces the discrepancy between the experimental and the corresponding theoretical predictions.

Conclusions. Our results provide direct evidence of the emergence of critical Casimir forces between two colloids and demonstrate the presence of pronounced three-body effects. These many-body critical Casimir forces strongly depend on the proximity to criticality of the fluid solvent, and can therefore be tuned, e.g. by changing its temperature or by altering the surface properties of the involved colloids. Criticality amounts to the occurrence of order parameter fluctuations on the spatial scale of the correlation length, which in principle can diverge and, thus, leads to the emergence of complex and nonadditive interactions at very large scales. They may find natural applications in various disciplines, such as in the realisation of colloidal molecules or reversible self-assembly, as well as the organisation of cellular membranes [\cite=machta2012critical] and possibly even the patterns of brain activation [\cite=haimovici2013brain]. Furthermore, in view of their similarity, these effects can also shine light on certain aspects of many-body effects concerning QED Casimir forces. While we focussed on configurations with three particles, the experimental setup and protocol discussed here are actually versatile enough to allow the investigation of the many-body potentials associated with a larger number of particles.

Methods

Experimental setup. The experimental setup combines HOTs and DVM (Supplementary Figure 1) and is build around a homemade microscope. A laser beam (wavelength 532  nm, power 500  mW) is expanded by a telescope and projected onto a phase-only spatial light modulator (Holoeye, PLUTO-VIS). The hologram on the spatial light modulator imposes a phase modulation onto the beam, allowing the generation of multiple trapping spots. The resulting beam is then projected onto the entrance pupil of a high-numerical-aperture oil-immersion objective (magnification 100  ×  , numerical aperture 1.30) by a series of lenses and mirrors arranged in a 4f-configuration [\cite=jones2015optical]. The objective focuses the beam in the sample plane and creates a series of reconfigurable traps. The DVM is realised using a standard configuration with white light illumination and a monochromatic CCD camera (200  fps). Since near Tc critical fluctuations depend very sensitively on small temperature changes, the microscope is enclosed within a thermally stabilised box in order to avoid any air flow, which may cause instability of the sample temperature. The sample holder is thermally isolated from the underneath translation stage with a teflon film. The necessary fine control of the temperature of the sample is achieved in two stages: first, the temperature of the microscope box is controlled to within ±  50  mK; second, a closed-loop controller (realised with a Pt100 temperature sensor and a Peltier heating/cooling element) keeps the temperature of the sample cell to within ±  2  mK. We remark that within each set of experiments the temperature T is gradually increased towards Tc.

Sample preparation. The binary liquid mixture used in all experiments is composed of water and 2,6-lutidine at the critical lutidine mass fraction ccL  =  0.286. The mixture undergoes a second-order phase transition at a lower critical point with temperature [formula] [\cite=grattoni1993lower]. The corresponding phase diagram is shown in Fig. 1a [\cite=grattoni1993lower]: it consists of two regions, corresponding to the mixed (white) and the demixed (grey) states with a lower critical point (CP). In all experiments we use silica colloids with diameter 2R = 2.06  ±  0.05μ (Microparticles GmbH). In the measurements involving hydrophobic particles, these silica colloids are treated chemically in order to make them hydrophobic, i.e. we silanise their surfaces with octyltriemthoxysilane. The sample cell containing the critical mixture and a small amount of colloids is a 200-μm-thick silica cuvette, which is sealed with teflon plugs in order to avoid evaporation of the mixture and to allow its usage for the whole duration of the experiment (ca. 1 day).

Data analysis. The raw data obtained from the various measurements are videos showing the orthogonal projection on a plane of the Brownian motion of the particles in three spatial dimensions and consisting of [formula] frames acquired at 200  fps. From these videos we extract the in-plane position (xi,yi) of the centre of each colloid i as a function of time using standard DVM algorithms [\cite=crocker1996methods] [\cite=jones2015optical], taking into account the necessary optical correction when the particles approach each other [\cite=baumgartl2005limits]. Based on these trajectories we calculate the in-plane surface-to-surface distance [formula] between particles i and j, which allows us to construct the histograms P2(3)(lij) corresponding to the acquired frames with two (three) close particles, and from them to determine the effective potentials U2(3)(lij)  =    -  kBT ln P2(3)(lij).

Monte Carlo integration. For each set of parameters we compute the theoretical in-plane surface-to-surface separation histograms P2(3)(lij) and the associated effective potentials U2(3)(lij) via a suitable Monte Carlo integration of the Boltzmann factors [formula] and [formula] with the theoretical potentials given by Eqs. ([\ref=eq:U2]), ([\ref=eq:C2]) and ([\ref=eq:U3]) with U(123) = 0 for the configurations with two and three close particles, respectively, based on the measured parameters for the optical traps and for the electrostatic interaction (Eq. ([\ref=eq:dlvo])). For instance, in the presence of three close particles, one has [formula], where [formula] is the position of particle i in a Cartesian coordinate system. In order to account for a (small) anisotropy of the generated optical traps, the data analysis and the fit are carried out by assuming [formula], where [formula] are the unit vectors along the principal orthogonal axes of the ellipsoidal trap, instead of Eq. ([\ref=eq:ot]). For all traps, [formula] turn out to lie almost within the x-y plane, with ki,x≃ki,y and ki,z≃0.3ki,x. In particular, we verified that the actual values of ki,z do not significantly affect the comparison between the theoretical predictions and the experimental data.
