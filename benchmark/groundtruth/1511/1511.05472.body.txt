Wavefunction Properties of a Single and a System of Magnetic Flux Tube(s) Oscillations

Introduction

Wave propagation in the magnetic flux tubes is one of the most fundamental problems of MHD theory structured as a building block to infer the physics behind the several solar phenomena [\citep=Priest1]. Since launching the first instruments for observing the sun, many different wave modes have been detected in the solar corona (standing and propagating slow- and fast-modes) which is discussed in a new field named coronal seismology. To obtain the physical properties of the coronal loops that are not easy to measure directly, the properties of the waves (such as the magnetic field, heating rate, and fine structure parameters) could be used. The original idea of wave properties in a nonuniform medium was suggested by [\cite=Uchida] and extended by [\cite=Roberts1] for slab and cylindrical geometries.

In the past decades, the special high-resolution observations taken by TRACE, SoHO, Yohkoh, etc. were applied to detect the kink oscillations in coronal loops [\citep=Aschwanden1] [\citep=Nakariakov1] [\citep=Aschwanden2] [\citep=Schrijver1] [\citep=wang+solanki]. Theoretical investigations such as the tube curvature, damping time, mode profiles, and the oscillations frequencies were carried out to depict a real physical image of the coronal loops [\citep=Gruszecki1] [\citep=Ruderman1] [\citep=van_Doorsselaere1] [\citep=Verwichte1] [\citep=Dymova+Ruderman]. The oscillatory behavior of the longitudinally stratified cylindrical loops are studied by [\cite=Andries1] [\cite=Safari1] [\cite=Erdelyi+verth]. The effects of the internal structure on the properties of transverse oscillations were investigated by [\cite=Arregui1]. [\cite=Pascoe1] studied the effects of a nonuniform cross section on the standing sausage modes of a coronal loop. Magnetic tubes with the elliptic cross-sections were analysed by [\cite=Ruderman2]. [\cite=verth+Erdelyi] assessed the effect of both the density and magnetic stratification on the transverse oscillations of a loop.

It seems that in the helically twisted loops, torsional oscillation modes should be measurable. The global torsional oscillations and Alfvén waves with long wave length may be detectable through the spectral line width along the loop and the spatial variation of the Doppler shift, respectively. The variation of global torsional modes in Fe  coronal emission line spectra in the upper layers of an active region at the solar limb were detected by [\cite=zaqarashvili1]. [\cite=Portier-Fozzani] suggested that the spatial motion along the loop with suitable helical geometries inferred for spatial verification of torsional MHD modes [\citep=Aschwanden3].

Comparing the frequencies of the collective oscillations of loops covering similar kink frequencies with those of the individual kink modes were studied by [\cite=Luna1]. Transverse oscillations of a multi-stranded coronal loops described as several parallel cylindrical strands are investigated by [\cite=Luna2]. They concluded the transverse oscillations of a loop get influence by the internal fine structure and the equivalent monolithic loop cannot be properly described by its transverse dynamics. The method of [\cite=Luna1] was generalized by [\cite=Fathalian+Safari] on the collective kink-like modes of the system of coronal loops to involve longitudinal density stratification along the loop axis.

The current research aims to model the identifications based on spatial behavior of wavefunction of straight single and a system of flux tubes. The governed linearized MHD equations are reduced to a single partial differential equation by applying the boundary conditions for the total pressure and the normal velocity component [\citep=Edwin+roberts] [\citep=Sakurai1] [\citep=Goossens1]. Both eigenfrequencies and wavefunctions are extracted to identify the modes of MHD oscillations.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section [\ref=GEB], we introduce the problem as a wave equation and discuss the boundary conditions governing on. In Section [\ref=Methods], we focus on the wavefunction to obtain numerical solutions and graphical results for both single and a system of flux tubes. Further, we discuss about our numerical method and graphical results which are given by extracting the wavefunctions. Sausage, kink, fluting and torsional (helical) kink modes are investigated. Regarding how the waves are arisen from the flux tube, they categorized into surface, body and leaky waves. In Section [\ref=Res] we review the categorization of wave propagation in the nonuniform medium with our numerical solutions. The model is generalized for a system of flux tubes that are located randomly inside its equivalent tube. The wavefunctions of flux tubes are studied in two cases of identical and nonidentical system of flux tubes. In Section [\ref=Sum], summary and discussion are given.

Governing Equations and Boundary Conditions

Governing Equations

MHD wave propagation in a spatially structured straight flux tube pervaded by magnetically straight plasma medium is studied. The equilibrium magnetic field is assumed to be straight and constant along the flux tube axis, [formula]. The density for the inside and outside of the tube is ρi and ρe, respectively. To make a longitudinal structuring, the density profile is assumed to be stratified by the function [formula], the stratification parameter is ε  =  L / H, where H indicates the atmospheric length scale. Thus, the equilibrium density profile for a single flux tube with its environment taking the form of

[formula]

where the density variation between inside and outside the flux tube is demonstrated by a step function (Θ) across the lateral surface. The length and radius of the flux tube are L and a, respectively. The tube ends are frozen at z  =    ±  L / 2 due to a dense photospheric plasma so that the density has a minimum at z = 0 and two maximum at z  =    ±  L / 2 (Fig. [\ref=fig1]). The gravity forces and the dissipative terms are neglected.

For a system of flux tubes, the density profile could be

[formula]

where the subscript n indicates the flux tubes number.

To describe the linear motion, we consider a small amplitude perturbation proportional to exp( - iωt) for all perturbed quantities. Therefore, the governing linearized MHD equations are reduced to the following single partial differential equation that denotes a wave equation under coronal condition (zero β approximation):

[formula]

where v2A  =  B2 / 4πρ(ε,z) is the square of the local Alfvén speed and bz is the perturbed magnetic field in the z component [\citep=Fathalian+Safari]. In order to use zero-β condition, the slow modes are removed from our studies.

Boundary Conditions

Equation ([\ref=eq3]) is an eigenvalue problem and can be solved in Cartesian coordinates with appropriate boundary conditions. The electrical field can be written in the form of [formula] in ideal MHD equations. Regarding that the tube ends are bounded in the photosphere, [formula], the tangential component of the vector [formula] is zero at the tube ends [\citep=Ruderman+Goossens]

[formula]

In order to consider the standing modes of the tube oscillations in z direction, the perturbed quantities (v and PT) are considered as

[formula]

where PT is defined as the magnetic pressures. In our model, both the interior and exterior magnetic fields are assumed to be constant but distinct. Thus, the boundary conditions for total pressure and the normal velocity component are kept in balance for inside and outside of the flux tube. Otherwise, the waves may steepen into shock at the lateral surface.

The boundary conditions at the lateral surface of flux tube (r  =  a) are give by [\citep=Edwin+roberts] [\citep=Donnelly1].

[formula]

The Bracket represents the difference across the tube boundaries. Equation ([\ref=eq3]) can be solved numerically for interior and exterior of the flux tube considering an appropriate density profile along with imposing the boundary conditions Eqs. ([\ref=eq5])-([\ref=eq6]).

Solution Using the Finite Element Method

We consider a geometry composed of longitudinally stratified flux tube inside a bounded cube in the Cartesian coordinates to solve numerically Eq. ([\ref=eq3]). The method we choose to solve our partial differential equation, Eq. ([\ref=eq3]), is the finite element method (FEM) to computing the primitive variables, eigenfrequencies and wavefunctions. In this method, each domain is divided into a collection of sub-domains. Each sub-domain represented by a set of element equations to the original problem. In this study, the domains type to perform the (FEM) solution is free tetrahedral. Figure [\ref=fig2] represents a sketch of a cylinder in a meshed bounded cube plotted by FEM. For more details of the FEM [\citep=strang+fix].

Results

Using the finite element method, Eq. ([\ref=eq3]) is numerically solved by imposing the boundary conditions and corresponding model. As stated on literatures [\citep=Edwin+roberts] [\citep=Goossens1], the oscillations of a single untwisted flux tube have been categorised into sausage m = 0, kink m = 1 and fluting m  ≥  2 modes.

In our numerical solution for a single flux tube, the ratio between the radius and cylinder length is chosen to be a / l  =  0.1. The density ratio for the inside and outside is proportional to ρe  /  ρi  =  0.1. The oscillation frequency is dimensionalized to fundamental Alfvén frequency (ωA = 2 ~ rad / s). The wavefunctions and oscillation modes are computed for different stratification parameters. Fundamental sausage mode (m  =  0, ~ l  =  1) and first overtone kink mode (m  =  1, ~ l  =  2) are illustrated. Normalized line graph of two dimensional wavefunctions are plotted along a line consists of two anti-nodes. By changing the stratification parameter, the antinodes move toward the tube ends [\citep=Erdelyi+verth] [\citep=Safari1], see Figs. [\ref=fig3] and [\ref=fig4]. The wavefunction of fluting mode (m  ≥  2) including four antinodes inside the tube is also shown by our numerical results, (Fig. 5).

Wavefunctions of a mode are interpreted as a kink torsional (helical) mode represented in Fig. [\ref=fig6]. The line slopes between the locations of the antinodes (indicated by strikes) are obtained for different cross sections by our two dimensional wavefunction. As it can be seen the slope is altered with changing the height (z). Movie 1 shows the twist of antinodes inside the flux tube that moves from down tube to top. [\cite=Portier-Fozzani] suggested to consider the Spatial motion along the loop as a verification of torsional modes if a suitable helical geometries would exist.

Following [\cite=Edwin+roberts], the analytical solution of the derived dispersion relation can be written by Bessel functions that indicates how the waves are propagated from the flux tube into the external medium. Body, surface, and leaky waves are described by different Bessel functions that are the solution of MHD wave equation. Body waves are propagations of which the maximum amplitude exists inside the flux tube, see Fig. [\ref=fig7]. The maximum amplitudes of surface waves occur at the lateral surface, (Fig. [\ref=fig8]). Leaky waves are getting arisen on their exterior medium and the maximum amplitude takes place outside of the tube, (Fig. [\ref=fig9]).

In the next step, we generalize our numerical solution for a system of 9 flux tubes that are distributed randomly inside a hypothetical flux tube. The wavefunctions of the oscillations could be useful to interpreting the modes. Each thin tube with length L, radius a  =  0.01L, and internal density ρi,n, (n indicates the tubes number) is located in a flux tube with radius R. The thin tubes are wrapped with a hypothetical flux tube of radius (R  =  0.065L) in a way that their center positions [formula], generated randomly inside the hypothetical flux tube. Condition d  ≥  (2a)  +  0.01 is applied for the center positions of circles. The term 0.01 denotes the minimum distance among the center of the circles. The density of the tube environment is ρe (Fig. [\ref=fig10]). Following [\cite=Luna2], for a system of N thin tubes, Eq. ([\ref=eq9]) is obtained in order to compare the wavefunctions of a system of flux tubes with the equivalent monolithic tube

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=eq3]) is numerically solved for a system of N  =  9 identical tubes, concerning the density profile as Eq. [\ref=eq2]. Each tube has identical density and radius. The density of each tube is assumed to be ρin  =  7.5 ~ ρe, with radius a, thus the equivalent density is obtained ρeq  =  9.519ρe from Eq. [\ref=eq9]. Wavefunctions of kink-like modes and fundamental kink mode for a system of identical thin tubes and its equivalent monolithic loop are investigated, respectively. Figure [\ref=fig11] shows the wavefunctions of the both system of identical tubes and equivalent monolithic loop in x - y and x - z planes. Moreover, in the case of nonidentical system, the density ratio of the tubes are taken to be ρi  /  ρe  =  {7.89, ~ 7.61, ~ 7.60, ~ 8.97, ~ 5.98, ~ 8.73, ~ 7.52, ~ 8.62, ~ 6.18}, and for the equivalent tube yields ρeq ~  =  ~ 9.580 ~ ρe. Likewise, the wavefunctions of the system of nonidentical tubes and its equivalent monolithic tube by applying the stratification parameter are extracted, (Fig. [\ref=fig12]).

On the basis of our numerical simulation, the wavefunctions of the collective kink-like oscillations in both identical and nonidentical systems are compared with those of the kink oscillations of their equivalent monolithic tubes. The results show that both the systems of identical and nonidentical flux tubes have approximately the same wavefunctions with the equivalent monolithic tube.

Summary and Discussion

We have studied the MHD oscillations of a single and a system of magnetized flux tube(s) under the coronal conditions. A single equation (Eq. [\ref=eq3]), for z component of the perturbed magnetic field, is numerically solved based on the finite element method.

The properties of wavefunctions of sausage, kink, fluting and torsional (helical) kink modes are extracted. We see the antinodes are moving toward the tube ends by changing the stratification parameters, including those in Figs. [\ref=fig3] and [\ref=fig4]. We detect and interpret a mode as a kink torsional(helical) mode (Fig. [\ref=fig6]). Sice the line slope between the location of antinodes was changing along the tube axis, that shows a twisting inside flux tube (Movie. 1). To future this goal, we are exploring the detection of torsional modes in our numerical solution domain. If successful, the torsion mode analysis would also be applied to observational data for composition of future instruments designed for studying the solar loops.

In other classification of wave propagation, those are categorised into body, surface, and leaky with respect to their positions of maximum amplitude in the nonuniform medium. Moreover, we extracted the wavefunctions of such waves from our numerical solution shown in Figs. [\ref=fig7], [\ref=fig8] and [\ref=fig9]. The numerical solution for both a system of identical and nonidentical flux tubes were developed. The collective kink-like oscillations of a system of both identical and nonidentical tubes were studied. In the stratified system of flux tubes, we concluded from our wavefunctions that the frequencies of kink-like modes are approximately the same as the kink modes of an individual monolithic flux tube, (see Figs. [\ref=fig11] and [\ref=fig12]) [\citep=Luna1] [\citep=Luna2] [\citep=Fathalian+Safari].
