On a discretization of confocal quadrics

Introduction

Confocal quadrics in [formula] belong to the favorite objects of classical mathematics, due to their beautiful geometric properties and numerous relations and applications to various branches of mathematics. To mention just a few obvious issues:

Optical properties of quadrics and their confocal families were discovered by the ancient Greeks and continued to fascinate mathematicians for many centuries, culminating in the famous Ivory and Chasles theorems from 19th century given a modern interpretation by Arnold [\cite=Arnold].

Dynamical systems: integrability of geodesic flows on quadrics (discovered by Jacobi) and of billiards in quadrics was given a far reaching generalization, with applications to the spectral theory, by Moser [\cite=Moser].

Gravitational properties of ellipsoids were studied in detail starting with Newton and Ivory, see [\cite=Arnold], [\cite=Fuchs-Tabachnikov], and are based to a large extent on the geometric properties of confocal quadrics.

Quadrics in general and confocal systems of quadrics particularly serve as favorite objects in differential geometry. They deliver a non-trivial example of isothermic surfaces which form one of the most interesting classes of "integrable" surfaces, that is, surfaces described by integrable differential equations and possessing a rich theory of transformations with remarkable permutability properties.

Confocal quadrics lie at the basis of the system of elliptic coordinates which allows for separation of variables in the Laplace operator. As such, they support a rich theory of special functions including Lamé functions and their generalizations [\cite=Bateman-Erdelyi].

In the present paper, we are interested in a discretization of a system of confocal quadrics, or, what is the same, of a system of elliptic coordinates in [formula]. According to the philosophy of structure preserving discretization [\cite=bobenko-suris], it is crucial not to follow the path of a straightforward discretization of differential equations, but rather to discretize a well chosen collection of essential geometric properties. In the case of confocal quadrics, the choice of properties to be preserved in the course of discretization becomes especially difficult, due to the above mentioned abundance of complementary geometric and analytic features.

A number of attempts to discretize quadrics in general and confocal systems of quadrics in particular, are available in the literature. In [\cite=tsukerman] a discretization of the defining property of a conic as an image of a circle under a projective transformation is considered. Since a natural discretization of a circle is a regular polygon, one ends up with a class of discrete curves which are projective images of regular polygons. Although this class has several nice geometric properties, this discretization is too simplistic. More sophisticated geometric constructions are developed in [\cite=Akopyan-Bobenko] and lead to a very interesting class of quadrilateral nets in a plane and in the space, with all quadrilaterals possessing an incircle, resp. all hexahedra possessing an inscribed sphere. An extremely rich geometric contents of their construction still waits for an adequate analytic description.

Our proposal takes as a departure point two properties of the elliptic coordinates: separability and equal Laplace invariants for all two-dimensional coordinate subnets (Koenigs property). The situation with this discretization is, in a sense, opposite to that of [\cite=Akopyan-Bobenko]: here we have an exhaustive analytic description, but geometric picture is still to be completed.

We would like to acknowledge the stimulating role of two research visits to TU Berlin, by W. Schief and by I. Taimanov, which took place in summer 2014. In our construction, we combine the discrete Euler-Darboux equations proposed by W. Schief (in a different context) and the fact that the elliptic coordinate system satisfies continuous Euler-Darboux equations, which we learned from I. Taimanov.

Euler-Darboux equation

Let [formula] be open and connected. We say that a net satisfies the Euler-Darboux system if all its two-dimensional subnets satisfy the (vector) Euler-Darboux equation with the same parameter γ:

[formula]

for all [formula], i  ≠  j.

For any s distinct indices [formula], we write

A two-dimensional subnet of a net [formula] corresponding to the coordinate directions i,j∈{1,...,M}, i  ≠  j, is called a Koenigs net, or, classically, a conjugate net with equal Laplace invariants, if there exists a function [formula] such that

[formula]

Let [formula] be a net satisfying the Euler-Darboux system ([\ref=eq:Euler-Darboux]). Then all two-dimensional subnets of [formula] are Koenigs nets.

The function ν(ui,uj)  =  |ui  -  uj|γ solves

[formula]

thus the Euler-Darboux system ([\ref=eq:Euler-Darboux]) is of the Koenigs form ([\ref=eq:Koenigs-condition]).

Eisenhart classified conjugate nets in [formula] with all two-dimensional coordinate surfaces being Koenigs nets [\cite=eisenhart]. The generic case is described by solutions of the Euler-Darboux system ([\ref=eq:Euler-Darboux]) with an arbitrary coefficient γ.

Elliptic coordinates

For given [formula], we consider the one-parameter family of confocal quadrics in [formula] given by

[formula]

Note that the quadrics of this family are centered at the origin and have the principal axes aligned along the coordinate directions.

For a given point [formula] with [formula], equation ([\ref=eq:confocal-quadrics]) is a polynomial equation of degree N in λ, with N real roots [formula] lying in the intervals These N roots correspond to the N confocal quadrics of the family that intersect at the point [formula]. Each of those quadrics is of a different signature. One can easily express [formula] throughf [formula]:

[formula]

Thus, for each point [formula] with [formula], there is exactly one solution [formula] of ([\ref=eq:elliptic-coordinates]), where

[formula]

On the other hand, for each [formula] there are exactly 2N solutions [formula], which are mirror symmetric with respect to the coordinate hyperplanes. In what follows, when we speak about the solution of ([\ref=eq:elliptic-coordinates]), we always mean the solution with the values in Thus, we are dealing with a parametrization of the first hyperoctant of [formula],

[formula]

such that the coordinate hyperplanes uk  =  const are mapped to the quadrics given by ([\ref=eq:confocal-quadrics]) with λ  =  uk. The coordinates [formula] are called elliptic coordinates.

Confocal quadrics as Koenigs nets

The net [formula] given by ([\ref=eq:elliptic-coordinates]) satisfies the Euler-Darboux system ([\ref=eq:Euler-Darboux]) with [formula]. In particular, all two-dimensional subnets of [formula] are Koenigs nets.

The partial derivatives of ([\ref=eq:elliptic-coordinates]) satisfy

[formula]

From this we compute the second order partial derivatives for i  ≠  j:

[formula]

The net [formula] given by ([\ref=eq:elliptic-coordinates]) is orthogonal, and thus gives a curvature line parametrization of any of its two-dimensional coordinate surfaces.

The partial derivatives of [formula] are given, according to [\eqref=eq:first-derivatives], by For i  ≠  j we compute the scalar product

[formula]

since [formula] satisfies ([\ref=eq:confocal-quadrics]) with λ  =  ul for l  =  i and l = j.

Propositions [\ref=prop:confocal-Euler-Darboux] and [\ref=prop:orthogonal] together imply that all two-dimensional coordinate surfaces of [formula] are isothermically parametrized.

Darboux classified orthogonal nets in [formula] whose two-dimensional coordinate surfaces are isothermic [\cite=darboux] . He found several families, all satisfying Euler-Darboux system with coefficient [formula], or - 2. The family corresponding to [formula] consists of confocal cyclides and includes the case of confocal quadrics (or their Möbius images).

From ([\ref=eq:elliptic-coordinates]) we observe that elliptic coordinates are described by very special (separable) solutions of Euler-Darboux equations ([\ref=eq:Euler-Darboux]). We will now show that the separability property is almost a characteristic one for elliptic coordinates.

A separable function [formula],

[formula]

is a solution of the Euler-Darboux system ([\ref=eq:Euler-Darboux]) iff the functions [formula], [formula], satisfy

[formula]

for some [formula] and for all ui∈Ui.

Computing the derivatives of ([\ref=eq:separable-solution]) for [formula] we obtain: and for the second derivatives (i  ≠  j):

[formula]

On the other hand, x satisfies the Euler-Darboux system ([\ref=eq:Euler-Darboux]), which implies

[formula]

From ([\ref=eq:separable-second-derivatives1]) and ([\ref=eq:separable-second-derivatives2]) we obtain

[formula]

or

[formula]

for all i,j  =  1,...,N, i  ≠  j, and (ui,uj)∈Uij. Thus, both the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the last equation do not depend on ui,uj. So, there exists a [formula] such that ([\ref=eq:separable-solution-dgl]) is satisfied.

For [formula] general solutions of ([\ref=eq:separable-solution-dgl]) are given, up to constant factors, by A separable solution of the Euler-Darboux system ([\ref=eq:Euler-Darboux]) with [formula] finally takes the form with some [formula], and with a constant [formula], which is the product of all the constant factors of ρi(ui,c) mentioned above.

Let [formula] and set Let [formula], [formula], be N independent separable solutions of the Euler-Darboux system ([\ref=eq:Euler-Darboux]) with [formula] defined on U and satisfying there the following boundary conditions:

[formula]

Then withand some D1,...,DN  >  0 and

[formula]

Thus, the net [formula] coincides with the elliptic coordinates on the positive hyperoctant, up to independent scaling along the coordinate axes [formula] with some [formula].

We have Boundary conditions ([\ref=eq:boundary-conditions1]), ([\ref=eq:boundary-conditions2]) yield that the constants are given by ck  =  ak, and that the solutions are actually given by [\eqref=eq:Euler-Darboux-separable-solutions]. Formulas ([\ref=eq:elliptic-coordinates]) are now equivalent to a specific choice of the constants Dk.

The boundary conditions ensure that the 2N - 1 faces of the boundary of U are mapped into the coordinate hyperplanes. Their images are degenerate quadrics of the confocal family ([\ref=eq:confocal-quadrics]).

The choice of the constants Dk  >  0, k  =  1,...,N that makes the separable solution ([\ref=eq:Euler-Darboux-separable-solutions]) to be the system of elliptic coordinates [\eqref=eq:elliptic-coordinates], can also be described as the unique scaling (up to a common factor) such that the parameter curves are pairwise orthogonal (compare the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:orthogonal]).

To summarize: the parametrization ([\ref=eq:elliptic-coordinates]) of the positive hyperoctant of a family of confocal quadrics ([\ref=eq:confocal-quadrics]) by elliptic coordinates is characterized by N independent separable solutions of the Euler-Darboux system ([\ref=eq:Euler-Darboux]) with [formula], satisfying the boundary conditions ([\ref=eq:boundary-conditions1]) and ([\ref=eq:boundary-conditions2]), and having pairwise orthogonal parameter curves.

Discrete Euler-Darboux equation

For a function f on [formula] we define the difference operator in the standard way: for all [formula], where [formula] is the i-th coordinate vector of [formula].

Let [formula]. We say that a discrete net satisfies the discrete Euler-Darboux system if all its two-dimensional subnets satisfy the (vector) discrete Euler-Darboux equation with the same parameter γ:

[formula]

for all [formula], i  ≠  j, and some [formula], [formula].

This discretization of the Euler-Darboux system was introduced by Konopelchenko and Schief [\cite=konopelchenko-schief].

As in the continuous case, solutions of the discrete Euler-Darboux system ([\ref=eq:discrete-Euler-Darboux]) are discrete conjugate nets (Q-nets), in the sense that all two-dimensional subnets have planar faces. See [\cite=bobenko-suris] for more information on Q-nets, as well as on geometric properties of discrete Koenigs nets which are defined as follows.

A two-dimensional discrete net [formula] corresponding to the coordinate directions [formula], i  ≠  j, is called a discrete Koenigs net if there exists a function [formula] such that

[formula]

Here we use the index notation to denote shifts of ν:

[formula]

Let [formula] be a discrete net satisfying the discrete Euler-Darboux system ([\ref=eq:discrete-Euler-Darboux]). Then all two-dimensional subnets of [formula] are discrete Koenigs nets.

We show that for a discrete net satisfying the discrete Euler-Darboux system the function ν can be found satisfying the ansatz so that νij  =  ν(ni + 1,nj + 1) = ν(ni,nj) = ν. Under this ansatz, equation ([\ref=eq:discrete-Koenigs]) simplifies to Comparing with ([\ref=eq:discrete-Euler-Darboux]) we obtain

[formula]

Thus, the function μ should satisfy

[formula]

This equation is easily solved: where Γ denotes the gamma function.

Discrete confocal quadrics

We have seen in the continuous case (Proposition [\ref=prop:Euler-Darboux-confocal-quadrics]) that confocal quadrics are described, up to a componentwise scaling, by separable solutions of the Euler-Darboux system ([\ref=eq:Euler-Darboux]) with [formula].

A separable function [formula],

[formula]

is a solution of the discrete Euler-Darboux system ([\ref=eq:discrete-Euler-Darboux]) iff the functions [formula], [formula], satisfy

[formula]

for some [formula] and for all ni∈Ui.

Substituting ([\ref=eq:discrete-separable-solution]) into ([\ref=eq:discrete-Euler-Darboux]) we obtain

[formula]

which is equivalent to

[formula]

So, the expression

[formula]

depends neither on ni nor on nj, i.e., is a constant. This is equivalent to [\eqref=eq:discrete-separable-solution-dgl].

If the constants γ, c and εi are such that neither εi  +  c nor εi  +  c  +  γ is an integer, then the general solution of ([\ref=eq:discrete-separable-solution-dgl]) is given by for all [formula] with some constants [formula].

To achieve boundary conditions similar to ([\ref=eq:boundary-conditions1]) and ([\ref=eq:boundary-conditions2]), we will be more interested in the cases where solutions are only defined on an integer half-axis, and vanish at its boundary point. For [formula] this is the case if:

either [formula], and then the general solution to the right of - c  -  εi is given by multiples of

[formula]

or [formula], and then the general solution to the left of [formula] is given by multiples of

[formula]

Let [formula] with [formula], and set Let [formula], [formula], be N independent separable solutions of the discrete Euler-Darboux system ([\ref=eq:discrete-Euler-Darboux]) with [formula] defined on U and satisfying the following boundary conditions: Then the shifts εi of the variables ni are given by

[formula]

and the solutions are expressed by

[formula]

with some D1,...,DN > 0 and

[formula]

Separable solutions of ([\ref=eq:discrete-Euler-Darboux]) are of the general form [\eqref=eq:discrete-solutions-with-boundary-conditions1] where each ρ(k)i(ni) = ρi(ni,εi + ck) is defined by one of the formulas [\eqref=eq:discrete-separable-solution-version1], [\eqref=eq:discrete-separable-solution-version2], and all multiplicative constants are collected in D1,...,DN  >  0. We have to determine suitable constants εi and ck.

The boundary conditions ([\ref=eq:discrete-boundary-conditions1]) and ([\ref=eq:discrete-boundary-conditions2]) imply that xk is defined for nk  ≥   - ak, while vanishing for nk  =   - ak, and also that xk is defined for nk - 1  ≤   - ak, while vanishing for nk - 1  =   - ak. This shows that

[formula]

We obtain [formula], and equation [\eqref=eq:epsilons] follows. Together with ck  +  εk  =  ak this implies

[formula]

It remains to substitute [\eqref=eq:_a_vs_c] into ([\ref=eq:discrete-separable-solution-version1]) and ([\ref=eq:discrete-separable-solution-version2]).

Discrete confocal quadrics are obtained by reflections in the coordinate hyperplanes from the discrete hypersurfaces in the positive hyperoctant which are given, up to componentwise scaling, by N independent separable solutions of the discrete Euler-Darboux equation ([\ref=eq:discrete-Euler-Darboux]) with [formula] that satisfy the boundary conditions ([\ref=eq:discrete-boundary-conditions1]) and ([\ref=eq:discrete-boundary-conditions2]), i.e., that are given by the formulas ([\ref=eq:discrete-solutions-with-boundary-conditions1]), ([\ref=eq:discrete-solutions-with-boundary-conditions2]).

As in the continuous case, the boundary conditions correspond to the 2N  -  1 degenerate quadrics of the confocal family lying in the coordinate hyperplanes, and enable the reflection construction.

The remaining scaling freedom (multiplicative constants Dk) is the same as in the continuous case. In the continuous case, one can fix the scaling by imposing the orthogonality condition [formula]. In the discrete case, to find an analogous condition remains a challenge.

The cases N = 2 and N = 3

N = 2

Continuous case

Let a  >  b  >  0. Then

[formula]

defines a parametrization by elliptic coordinates of the first quadrant of [formula]. A family of confocal conics is obtained by reflections in the coordinate axes.

Discrete case

We start with the general formula for a separable solution of the discrete Euler-Darboux system ([\ref=eq:discrete-Euler-Darboux]) where suitable choice of solutions ([\ref=eq:discrete-separable-solution-version1]), ([\ref=eq:discrete-separable-solution-version2]) has already been done according to the continuous case. We use the above ansatz to illustrate the choice of the coordinate shifts εi and ck according to boundary conditions ([\ref=eq:discrete-boundary-conditions1]) and ([\ref=eq:discrete-boundary-conditions2]). For [formula] with α  >  β, we define c1,c2 and ε1,ε2 such that we obtain a map where the boundary components n1  =    -  α, n1  =    -  β, and n2  =    -  β correspond to degenerate conics that lie on the coordinate axes, i.e.,

[formula]

For this, the following linear system of equations has to be satisfied:

[formula]

As a consequence, we find: Thus, we end up with the formulas

[formula]

They give us, up to scaling along the coordinate axes, discrete elliptic coordinates on the first quadrant of [formula]. From this we generate a family of discrete confocal conics by reflections in the coordinate axes.

N = 3

Continuous case

Let a  >  b  >  c  >  0. Then formulas

[formula]

define a parametrization of the first octant of [formula] by elliptic coordinates, A family of confocal quadrics is obtained by reflections in the coordinate planes (see Figure [\ref=fig:confocal3d], left).

The planes u3  =  const are mapped to ellipsoids. In the degenerate case [formula] one has z  =  0, while x(u1,u2) and y(u1,u2) exactly recover the two-dimensional case ([\ref=eq:confocal2d-map]) on the inside of an ellipse given by [formula].

The planes u2  =  const are mapped to one-sheeted hyperboloids with the two degenerate cases corresponding to [formula] and [formula].

The planes u1  =  const are mapped to two-sheeted hyperboloids with the two degenerate cases corresponding to [formula] and [formula].

Discrete case

Let [formula] with α  >  β  >  γ. Then formulas define a discrete net in the first octant of [formula] (discrete elliptic coordinate system), A family of discrete confocal quadrics is obtained by reflections in the coordinate planes (see Figure [\ref=fig:confocal3d], right).

The five boundary components n1  =    -  α, n1  =    -  β, n2  =    -  β, n2  =    -  γ, and n3  =    -  γ are mapped to degenerate quadrics that lie in the coordinate planes. Note, e.g., that for n3  =    -  γ one has z  =  0, while x(n1,n2) and y(n1,n2) exactly reproduce the two-dimensional case ([\ref=eq:discrete-confocal2d-map]).

Conclusions

In the smooth case the orthogonality condition fixes the affine freedom of the choice of the scaling constants Dk, and so determines the confocal quadrics uniquely as special solutions of the Euler-Darboux equation (see Remark [\ref=rem.D_cont]). A discretization of the orthogonality condition remains an open problem: a geometric orthogonality condition that fixes the scaling constants Dk (see Remark [\ref=rem.D_disc]) is unknown.
