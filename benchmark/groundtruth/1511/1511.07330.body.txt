Introduction

Variability studies of gravitationally lensed quasars (GLQs) are a powerful means to study the Universe [\citep=Sch06]. For example, time delays of GLQs are used to estimate cosmological parameters, primarily the current expansion rate of the Universe [\citep=Ogu07] [\citep=Suy10] [\citep=Suy13] [\citep=Ser14] [\citep=Rat15]. In addition, microlensing-induced flux variations reveal, among other things, the structure of quasars and properties of populations of stars (microlenses) in galaxies [\citep=Koc04] [\citep=Eig08] [\citep=Poi08] [\citep=Dai10] [\citep=Mor10] [\citep=Mor12] [\citep=Hai13] [\citep=Mos13] [\citep=Bla14] [\citep=Mac15]. Multiwavelength intrinsic variability of GLQ images also produces valuable reverberation maps of emitting regions of quasars [\citep=Gil12] [\citep=Goi12], which will become in critical tools to check microlensing-derived source structures.

As searching for new lensed quasars and conducting subsequent monitoring campaigns are tasks of great relevance in cosmology, current quasar databases are being deeply mined to discover new GLQs [\citep=Ogu06] [\citep=Ina12] [\citep=Jac12] [\citep=Ely13] [\citep=Buc14] [\citep=Agn15a] [\citep=Nor15], and several techniques are being developed to search for GLQs in ongoing and future surveys [\citep=Agn15b] [\citep=Cha15]. The GLQ zoo includes rare phenomena consisting of two optically bright images (r  <   20) of the same distant quasar that are separated by Δθ  >   2arcsec. Only five out of the 100 multiply-imaged systems in the CfA-Arizona Space Telescope Lens Survey (CASTLES) database satisfy these conditions. Each of the optically bright, wide separation double quasars is of particular interest because it can be easily monitored with an 1-  2m class telescope in average seeing conditions, and the time delay between its two images can be obtained from light curves and cross-correlation techniques [\citep=Poi07] [\citep=Sha08] [\citep=Kop12] [\citep=Eul13] [\citep=Rat13]. Detection of time delays between different optical bands [\citep=Kop10] and uncorrelated (microlensing-induced) variations in light curves of the quasar images [\citep=Osc13] is also possible.

The ongoing monitoring projects do not only focus on bright and widely-separated double quasars, although several targets belong to this type of systems. There are currently many cross-correlation techniques to determine time delays of GLQs [\citep=Lia15], and the Cosmological Monitoring of Gravitational Lenses (COSMOGRAIL) is a collaboration targeting ~   20 GLQs to (mainly) measure their time delays [\citep=Tew12]. The COSMOGRAIL website incorporates a list of main publications, light curves and other relevant information. This large collaboration uses 1-  2m telescopes in both hemispheres, and has published light curves and time delays of 7 GLQs with optically bright images. Two of them are widely-separated doubles [\citep=Eul13] [\citep=Rat13], three are quads with some widely-separated images, and two are doubles with Δθ  ~   1arcsec. Other groups are also involved in similar programmes. For example, the Gravitational Lenses and Dark Matter (GLENDAMA) project is conducting an optical monitoring of ~   10 bright GLQs with different angular sizes. The GLENDAMA team uses a 2m robotic telescope in the north hemisphere with the purpose of measuring time delays, and analysing intrinsic and extrinsic (microlensing) flux variations [\citep=Goi10].

In this paper, we present our ongoing search for GLQs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) database [\citep=Eis11]. The selection of GLQ candidates and the corresponding identification campaigns are described in Sec. [\ref=sec:selide]. All candidates are composed of two point-like sources: one of them is a confirmed quasar and the other belongs to an unknown class. Our spectroscopic observations confirm the GLQ nature of SDSS J1442+4055, which has been independently discovered by [\citet=Mor15]. In Sec. [\ref=sec:q1442], using new deep imaging in the r band, we present astro-photometric solutions and lens models for this optically bright, wide separation lens system. Our conclusions and future prospects appear in Sec. [\ref=sec:final].

Selection and identification of GLQ candidates

Samples

Our first sample (S1) of GLQ candidates is based on the SDSS-III Data Release 9 [\citep=Ahn12]. We used the Data Release 9 Quasar (DR9Q) catalog containing 87 822 spectroscopically confirmed objects [\citep=Par12], as well as gri frames including these quasars and other surrounding sources. We initially checked for the presence of some point-like source in the vicinity (1-  6arcsec apart) of each DR9Q quasar over the redshift interval 0.8 <  z  <   4 and brighter than r = 21. After finding an association, the similarity of colours of the quasar and its companion was probed. Specifically, we estimated the average magnitude difference AMD = (Δg + Δr + Δi)/3 for each pair, and then selected pairs satisfying the constraints dg  <   0.4, dr  <   0.4 and di  <   0.4, where dg = Δg - AMD, dr = Δr - AMD and di = Δi - AMD. After visual inspection of the selected targets, we obtained a sample of 39 candidates.

To construct a second sample (S2), we used the SDSS-III DR10 [\citep=Ahn14] [\citep=Par14] and adopted a selection method different from the previous one (see above). We concentrated on quasars in the range RA = 180-  360, over the redshift interval 1 <  z  <   5 and brighter than r = 20. We then searched for neighbour point-like sources at Δθ  ≤   6arcsec. For the widely-separated quasar-companion pairs (Δθ  >   2arcsec), a detailed colour test was also done. Using the corresponding ugriz frames, we compared colours of quasars and their companions, and selected pairs satisfying the constraints [formula] 0.4, [formula] 0.2, [formula] 0.2 and [formula] 0.4. After visual inspection, we selected 17 GLQ candidates for the S2 sample. None of these new targets is included in S1.

Our selection criteria differ from those used to make the statistical lens sample of the SDSS Quasar Lens Search [\citep=Ogu06] [\citep=Ina12], since we focus on double quasar candidates with separations of a few arcseconds, which are within a larger cosmic volume and cover a wider range of magnitudes. However, the SQLS database also contains additional double quasars that are not included in the statistical sample [\citep=Ina09].

Follow-up observations of selected subsamples

From the whole S1 sample in Sec. [\ref=sec:sample], we took a subsample (SS1) of three targets to perform follow-up observations (see Table [\ref=tab:selide]). We focused on ~   10% of the initial sample in the RA interval 110-  120. These three SS1 candidates in Table [\ref=tab:selide] have a large separation, and the inmediate goal of the observations was to check the efficiency of our first selection method and try to discover some new GLQ. We attempted to obtain decent spectra for all SS1 targets in 2014. However, the spectra of the faintest candidate were very noisy, so it was also imaged. For this candidate, in Sec. [\ref=sec:result], we only present the analysis of its astro-photometric data.

We selected ~   80% of the S2 sample, i.e., 14 out of the 17 initial candidates (see Table [\ref=tab:selide]), to make a second subsample in the RA interval 180-  330 (SS2). We first obtained follow-up images for 13 SS2 candidates at the Maidanak Astronomical Observatory (MAO) in 2015 June, and then attempted to conduct spectroscopic observations of each target whose follow-up images showed evidence for both a lensing galaxy and a variable companion. As almost all (12) SS2-MAO targets have a quasar at z  >   2, the presence of a residual object (residual signal above the noise level) was considered as evidence for a lensing galaxy (see Sec. [\ref=sec:result]). In addition, companion sources with flux variations (absolute differences between their SDSS and MAO magnitudes in the r band) of ≥   0.1 mag were identified as variable objects. Unfortunately, we could not complete the spectroscopic observations due to observing constraints. However, we obtained spectra for the only SS2 target that was not imaged during the intensive observational campaign in 2015 June. This last candidate had weaker observing constraints than the pending targets showing flux variations and residual sources.

Results

SDSS J0734+2733 is the brightest candidate, i.e., two components with r  ~   17. This was observed with the integral field spectrograph (FRODOSpec) on the 2m Liverpool Telescope (LT). A 3200 s exposure on a dark night under normal seeing conditions was taken with this instrument. FRODOSpec is characterised by a field of view and a spatial scale of ~   10arcsec×  10arcsec and 0 pixel- 1, respectively, and allows us to extract individual spectra for two point-like sources separated by a few pixels [\citep=Sha14]. We also note that the spectrograph has two independent arms, allowing simultaneous spectroscopy at blue and red wavelengths. However, the sensitivity of its red arm is significantly higher, so we only show the red spectra of SDSS J0734+2733 in the left panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:candi1]. The original FRODOSpec/red-arm data (spectral resolving power R  ~   2200) have been smoothed using a rectangular smoothing window of 24 Å. While the confirmed quasar (component A; red line) shows a emission line near 8200 Å, this feature is absent in the spectrum of its companion (component B; blue line). Hence, we conclude that SDSS J0734+2733 is not a double quasar.

SDSS J0735+2036 was observed with the Device Optimized for the Low Resolution (DOLORES) on the 3.6m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG). We used the LR-B grism (R  ~   600 and 0 pixel- 1) and the 1 long slit, putting this slit in the direction joining both optically bright components (r  ~   19). The spectroscopic exposure of 1200 s was done on a dark night. In the middle panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:candi1], we depict the TNG/DOLORES spectra of the quasar (component A; red line) and the previously unidentified object (component B; blue line). The continuum of B is similar to that of the quasar, but there are no emission lines superimposed. Thus, the companion object is likely a star.

Regarding SDSS J0755+1400 (r  ~   19-  20), we obtained I-band exposures with the Andalucia Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (ALFOSC) on the 2.5m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT). This camera has a spatial scale of 0 pixel- 1, which makes it a suitable instrument, in good seeing conditions, to try to detect a possible lensing galaxy between the two sources. Unfortunately, only half of individual frames were useful, and these were combined to produce a single deep exposure (1800 s of dark time under good seeing conditions). We then subtracted two point-spread functions (PSFs) from the NOT/ALFOSC combined frame of the candidate, using nearby stars as PSF templates. In the right panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:candi1], we display the residual frame after subtracting the two point-like sources centred at the green crosses. Actually the residual signal was smoothed with a median filter in circular neighborhoods (4-pixel radius), and contains a possible very faint source (I  >   22) close to the quasar B. However, this source (if real) is not expected to be the lensing galaxy of a quasar at z = 0.845 because so faint lensing objects are usually associated with GLQs at z  >   3 (see the CASTLES database1). Assuming an early-type lens galaxy, we can also infer the expected value of the lens magnitude in the I band as a function of the lens redshift zlens [\citep=Rus03]. The NOT/ALFOSC data are against the GLQ nature of SDSS J0755+1400, since the lens galaxy should have I  <   19 at zlens  ≤   0.8.

Using the Seoul National University Camera (SNUCam) on the 1.5m AZT-22 Telescope (0 pixel- 1) at the MAO, we obtained 3600 s (6×  600 s) exposures in the SDSS r and/or i bands for 13 out of the 14 SS2 candidates (see Table [\ref=tab:selide]). Most individual frames were taken under good seeing conditions (FWHM ≤   1arcsec), and only three combined r-band frames led to residual signals above the noise level, i.e., residual sources with r  ≤   23. These combined frames are shown in the left panels of Fig. [\ref=fig:candi2]. After subtracting two PSFs within the regions containing quasar-companion (A-B) pairs, the residual frames are also presented in the right panels of Fig. [\ref=fig:candi2]. We only focused on the three targets having an associated residual source (R), which was interpreted as evidence of the existence of a lensing galaxy. The average redshift and separation for the 13 candidates are 〈z〉 = 2.3 and 〈Δθ〉 = 2, so there is a weak constraint r  ≤   23 on r-band magnitudes of possible early-type lens galaxies at zlens  ≤   2. We also checked the variability of the companion sources (comparing their new MAO magnitudes with the corresponding SDSS data), since quasars are variable objects. This kind of test has been proposed by [\citet=Koc06] and [\citet=Buc14] among others. The 3 companions are variable sources because we detected appreciable changes in their r-band magnitudes, i.e., [formula] 0.1.

SDSS J1442+4055 has two bright components (r  ~   18-  19), and the residual object appears in the expected position for a main lensing galaxy. A possible secondary lens also lies southwest of this object in the top right panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:candi2]. Through PSF photometry in the r band (using standard IRAF tasks), we calculated magnitude differences betwen two epochs separated by ~   10 years: SDSS(2003 March) -   MAO(2015 June). For field stars, these differences were only about ±   0.01, while we obtained highly significant flux decrements of ~   0.1-  0.2 magnitudes for both components. These are strong arguments in favour of the GLQ nature of SDSS J1442+4055, and thus, we selected this target for spectroscopic follow-up observations with the highest priority. The other two candidates: SDSS J1617+3827 (r  ~   19-  21) and SDSS J1642+3200 (r  ~   18-  21), do not show significant residues on the lines joining their components (see the middle and bottom right panels of Fig. [\ref=fig:candi2]). The residual objects are located northeast of the bright quasar with r  ~   19 (SDSS J1617+3827) or around the faint companion object with r  >   20 (SDSS J1642+3200). Additionally, the quasars and their companions have experienced flux decrements that exceed the noise level (0.01 mag) in factors from 3 to 30. Therefore, these two candidates also deserve more attention, and they were selected as secondary targets for spectroscopy. Unfortunately, we were not able to get decent spectra for both targets.

We observed SDSS J1442+4055 with the Spectrograph for the Rapid Acquisition of Transients (SPRAT) on the 2m LT. Although the sky was relatively bright, the strong evidence for a GLQ and the near end of the target visibility window justified urgent spectroscopic observations. Using the blue grating and the 1 long slit (R  ~   350 and 0 pixel- 1), we took five 600 s exposures in normal seeing conditions (FWHM ~   1). The top panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:candi2spec] shows the combined (3000 s) spectra of A (quasar) and B (companion source), which incorporate Lyα+, +], and ] emission lines at very similar wavelengths. A cross-correlation between the two spectra proved that their redshifts are identical, and this corroborated the GLQ nature of SDSS J1442+4055.

We also obtained SPRAT spectra for the only SS2 target that was not observed at the MAO. The candidate SDSS J1655+1948 consists of a relatively faint quasar (B) with r  ~   20 and a bright companion (A) with r  ~   18, and its 3000 s spectra are depicted in the bottom panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:candi2spec]. For this GLQ candidate, the A component is a star whose spectrum incorporates several absorption lines at z  ~   0. We failed again in a positive identification of a candidate selected by standard methods (see Sec. [\ref=sec:sample]), and this stresses the efficiency in detecting GLQs using more sophisticated selection criteria, i.e., existence of a residual object and variable components.

SDSS J1442+4055

The MAO r-band imaging of SDSS J1442+4055 (FWHM ~   1arcsec) was also used to infer astro-photometric solutions for the new lens system. Through the GALFIT software [\citep=Pen02], this was modelled as two PSFs (quasar images) plus a standard galaxy profile convolved with the PSF. We considered a 2D Sérsic profile [\citep=Ser63] for the main lensing galaxy, since it can describe light distributions for different types of galaxies. In the left and right panels of Fig. [\ref=fig:q1442], we display the residual signal after subtracting the two quasar images and the final residues after subtracting the global best fit (quasar images + main lensing galaxy), respectively. The main lens (G1) and the secondary lens (G2) are clearly resolved in the left panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:q1442]. Apart from the solution leaving the concentration index (n) as a free parameter (Sérsic profile), we also used a de Vaucouleurs profile for G1 to obtain a second solution, i.e., fixing n = 4, rather than leaving it as a free parameter (see Table [\ref=tab:q1442]). This is a reasonable profile for early-type galaxies and galactic bulges, and it may be useful for extracting quasar fluxes from optical frames in monitoring campaigns [\citep=Sha08]. However, the reduced chi-squared value is 1.8, so the 1σ confidence intervals that we give in Table [\ref=tab:q1442] should be taken with caution.

SDSS J1442+4055 has been independently discovered by [\citet=Mor15]. When we were writing this report, [\citet=Mor15] announced the discovery of thirteen GLQs, including SDSS J1442+4055 between their confirmed lens systems. They used a 900 s i-band exposure with the 2.4m Hiltner Telescope to model the system, whereas our fits were based on an r-band combined frame with an equivalent exposure time (2.4m telescope) of 1400 s. We note that our estimation of [formula] in Table [\ref=tab:q1442] coincides with the ([formula] + [formula])/2 value from Table 3 of More et al. Although there is also agreement in the values of e and [formula] (the Sérsic profile led to [formula] 1arcsec and a large index n  >   4), our θe values are separated by ~   90 from the More at al.'s solution for the position angle.

Even though the redshift of the main lensing galaxy (G1) is still unknown, the current SDSS-MAO data give a hint as to the zlens value. The SDSS spectrum of the A image shows the existence of an absorption system at zabs = 1.946, which was identified from 12 different absorption features in the wavelength range 4500-  8500 Å. However, the Rusin et al.'s scheme [\citep=Rus03] is in clear disagreement with a bright lens (r  ~   19.5; see Table [\ref=tab:q1442]) at zlens  ~   2, so the distant absorption system is most likely not linked to G1. We may also consider a second scenario where G1 is physically associated with G2 (r  ~   20). As the SDSS database includes a photometric redshift for G2 (0.32 ±   0.05), zlens would be ~   0.3-  0.4. This lens redshift is in good agreement with the MAO brightness of G1, and thus, the gravitational lens could consist of two galaxies at similar moderate values of z.

We also modelled SDSS J1442+4055 using the relative astrometry in Table [\ref=tab:q1442] and the i-band flux ratio by [\citet=Mor15], as well as a singular isothermal sphere (SIS) mass model in a standard cosmology [\citep=Sch06]. The LENSMODEL software [\citep=Kee01] led to a solution with χ2  ≫   1, indicating we need to improve our model. The simplest option is to add ellipticity to the SIS mass distribution of G1. Thus, we used the LENSMODEL package to find the singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) solution for the astro-photometric constraints. The number of model parameters was the same as the number of observational constraints, and the new solution was characterized by a mass scale b  ~   1, an ellipticity e  ~   0.017, a mass orientation of about -  60 and χ2  ~   0. Although the ellipticity and orientation of the mass do not coincide with the ellipticity and orientation for the light distribution of G1 (see the two last columns in Table [\ref=tab:q1442]), we remark that we are dealing with an effective mass distribution, since the secondary lens (G2) was not modelled in any way. For this effective lens model (SIE), the expected time delay is ~   40 days if zlens = 0.4 (A is leading).

Conclusions and future work

Using the SDSS-III DR9 [\citep=Ahn12] [\citep=Par12] and DR10 [\citep=Ahn14] [\citep=Par14], we have searched for new double quasars with separations of 1-  6arcsec. As expected, samples of a few candidates selected from standard criteria (i.e., a quasar and a point-like companion source, having both similar colours) were largely inefficient tools to find new GLQs [\citep=Ina12]. For this reason, we introduced two additional ingredients in the selection procedure: presence of a residual source (lensing galaxy?) in a new deep exposure, and detection of flux variations by comparing the SDSS imaging and the new non-SDSS exposure.

After an observational campaign at the Maidanak Astronomical Observatory, we found three GLQ candidates satisfying all our selection criteria. The most promising target (SDSS J1442+4055) was spectroscopically observed in 2015 August, showing two identical spectra for the quasar and its companion [\citep=Mor15]. This is an optically bright, wide separation double quasar whose images appreciably vary in parallel on a 10-year timescale (see Sec. [\ref=sec:result]). Therefore, SDSS J1442+4055 is an excellent target to be monitored with an 1-  2m class telescope from late 2015. Besides light curves of the two quasar images, new spectroscopy and deep imaging are required to accurately determine the lens redshift zlens and the astro-photometric parameters. The current astro-photometric data suggest that zlens  ~   0.3-  0.4, where the main lens would be the galaxy G1, while another neighbor galaxy (G2) would also contribute to the gravitational mirage. Spectroscopic observations of the other two GLQ candidates (SDSS J1617+3827 and SDSS J1642+3200) are also needed to determine their GLQ nature.

The new lens system SDSS J1442+4055 is now included in the GLENDAMA list of GLQs, so it will be observed with the LT, the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias and other facilities. We also plan to perform a spectroscopic follow-up of the two variable targets with residual sources (SDSS J1617+3827 and SDSS J1642+3200), as well as two additional variable targets that do not show residual sources with r  ≤   23 (SDSS J2053-0100 and SDSS J2153+2732; see Table [\ref=tab:selide]). In the near future, we will also explore the feasibility to find new GLQs in the SDSS-III and other databases, by using pairs of unidentified point-like sources showing evidence for variability [\citep=Koc06] [\citep=Buc14].
