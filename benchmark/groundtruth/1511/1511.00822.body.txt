Some curiosities of the algebra of bounded Dirichlet series

Introduction

The aim of this short note is to make explicit two observations about algebraic properties of the ring [formula] of bounded Dirichlet series. In particular we will show that

[formula] is not a coherent ring. (This is essentially an immediate consequence of Eric Amar's proof of the noncoherence of the Hardy algebra [formula] of the polydisk [formula] for n  ≥  3 [\cite=Ama].)

[formula] has infinite Bass stable rank. (This is a straightforward adaptation of the first author's proof of the fact that the stable rank of the infinite polydisk algebra is infinite [\cite=Mor]). As corollaries, we obtain that [formula] has infinite topological stable rank, and infinite Krull dimension.

Before giving the relevant definitions, we briefly mention that [formula] is a closed Banach subalgebra of the classical Hardy algebra [formula] consisting of all bounded and holomorphic functions in the open right half plane

[formula]

and it is striking to compare our findings with the corresponding results for [formula]:

Nevertheless the above results for [formula] lend support to Harald Bohr's idea of interpreting Dirichlet series as functions of infinitely many complex variables, a key theme used in the proofs of the main results in this note.

We recall the pertinent definitions below.

The algebra [formula] of bounded Dirichlet series

[formula] denotes the set of Dirichlet series

[formula]

where [formula] is a sequence of complex numbers, such that f is holomorphic and bounded in [formula]. Equipped with pointwise operations and the supremum norm,

[formula]

[formula] is a unital commutative Banach algebra. In [\cite=HedLinSei], it was shown that the Banach algebra [formula] is precisely the multiplier space of the Hilbert space H of Dirichlet series

[formula]

for which

[formula]

The importance of the Hilbert space H stems from the fact that its kernel function KH(z,w) is related to the Riemann zeta function ζ:

[formula]

For [formula], let [formula] be the closed subalgebra of [formula] consisting of Dirichlet series of the form [\eqref=eq_DS_1] involving only integers n generated by the first m primes [formula].

[formula]

In [\cite=HedLinSei], it was established that [formula] is isometrically (Banach algebra) isomorphic to [formula], a certain algebra of functions analytic in the infinite dimensional polydisk, defined below. As this plays a central role in what follows, we give an outline of this based on [\cite=HedLinSei], [\cite=Sei] and [\cite=MauQue].

A seminal observation made by H. Bohr [\cite=Boh], is that if we put

[formula]

where pn denotes the nth prime, then, in view of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, formally a Dirichlet series in [formula] or [formula] can be considered as a power series of infinitely many variables. Indeed, each n has a unique expansion

[formula]

with nonnegative αj(n)s, and so, from [\eqref=eq_DS_1], we obtain the formal power series

[formula]

where [formula] or [formula] depending on whether f is a function in [formula] or in [formula]. Let us recall Kronecker's Theorem on diophantine approximation [\cite=HarWri]:

For each [formula], the map

[formula]

has dense range in [formula], where [formula].

Using the above and the Maximum Principle, it can be shown that for [formula],

[formula]

where the norm on the right hand side is the [formula] norm. Here [formula] denotes the usual Hardy algebra of bounded holomorphic functions on the polydisk [formula], endowed with the supremum norm:

[formula]

In [\cite=HedLinSei], it was shown that this result also holds in the infinite dimensional case. In order to describe this result, we introduce some notation. Let c0 be the Banach space of complex sequences tending to 0 at infinity, with the induced norm from [formula], and let B be the open unit ball of that Banach space. Thus with [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

For a point [formula], we set [formula] that is, zk = 0 for k > m. Substituting [formula] in the argument of F given formally by [\eqref=eq_formal_cap_F], we obtain a function

[formula]

which we call the mth-section Fm (after Bohr's terminology "mte abschnitt"). F is said to be in [formula] if the H∞ norm of these functions Fm are uniformly bounded, and denote the supremum of these norms to be [formula]. Using Schwarz's Lemma for the polydisk, it can be seen that for [formula],

[formula]

and so we may define

[formula]

It was shown in [\cite=HedLinSei] that [\eqref=eq_norm_eq] remains true in the infinite dimensional case, and so we may associate [formula] with [formula].

There exists a Banach algebra isometric isomorphism [formula].

Coherence

Let R be a unital commutative ring, and for [formula], let [formula] (n times).

For [formula], a relation [formula] on [formula] is an n-tuple [formula] in Rn such that

[formula]

The set of all relations on [formula] is denoted by [formula].

The ring R is said to be coherent if for each n and each [formula], the R-module [formula] is finitely generated.

A property which is equivalent to coherence is that the intersection of any two finitely generated ideals in R is finitely generated, and the annihilator of any element is finitely generated [\cite=Cha]. We refer the reader to the article [\cite=Gla] and the monograph [\cite=Gla2] for the relevance of the property of coherence in commutative algebra. All Noetherian rings are coherent, but not all coherent rings are Noetherian. (For example, the polynomial ring [formula] is not Noetherian because the sequence of ideals [formula] is ascending and not stationary, but [formula] is coherent [\cite=Gla2].)

In the context of algebras of holomorphic functions in the unit disk [formula], we mention [\cite=McVRub], where it was shown that the Hardy algebra [formula] is coherent, while the disk algebra [formula] isn't. For n  ≥  3, Amar [\cite=Ama] showed that the Hardy algebra [formula] is not coherent. (It is worth mentioning that whether the Hardy algebra [formula] of the bidisk is coherent or not seems to be an open problem.) Using Amar's result, we will prove the following result:

[formula] is not coherent.

Stable rank

In algebraic K-theory, the notion of (Bass) stable rank of a ring was introduced in order to facilitate K-theoretic computations [\cite=Bas].

Let R be a commutative ring with an identity element (denoted by 1).

An element [formula] is called unimodular if there exist elements [formula] in R such that

[formula]

The set of all unimodular elements of Rn is denoted by Un(R).

We say that [formula] is reducible if there exists an element [formula] such that

[formula]

The Bass stable rank of R is the least integer [formula] for which every a∈Un + 1(R) is reducible. If there is no such integer n, we say that R has infinite stable rank.

Using the same idea as in [\cite=Mor] (that the infinite polydisk algebra [formula] has infinite Bass stable rank), we show the following.

The Bass stable rank of [formula] is infinite.

For Banach algebras, an analogue of the Bass stable rank, called the topological stable rank, was introduced by Marc Rieffel in [\cite=Rie].

Let R be a commutative complex Banach algebra with unit element 1. The least integer n for which Un(R) is dense in Rn is called the topological stable rank of R. We say R has infinite topological stable rank if no such integer n exists.

The topological stable rank of [formula] is infinite.

This follows from the inequality that the Bass stable rank of a commutative unital semisimple complex Banach algebra is at most equal to its topological stable rank; see [\cite=Rie].

The Krull dimension of a commutative ring R is the supremum of the lengths of chains of distinct proper prime ideals of R.

The Krull dimension of [formula] is infinite.

This follows from the fact that if a ring has Krull dimension d, then its Bass stable rank is at most d + 2; see [\cite=Hei].

Noncoherence of [formula]

We will use the following fact due to Amar [\cite=Ama].

[formula] is not a finitely generated [formula]-module.

The main idea of the proof is that, using the isomorphism ι, essentially we boil the problem down to working with [formula]. Let

[formula]

Then ι(f1) = z1 - z2 and ι(f2) = z2 - z3. Suppose that [formula] is a finitely generated [formula]-module, say by

[formula]

We will show that the 3rd section of the image under ι of the above elements generate [formula] in [formula], contradicting Proposition [\ref=prop_Amar]. If

[formula]

then F1G(1) + F2G(2) = 0, and by applying ι- 1, we see that

[formula]

So there exist [formula] such that

[formula]

Applying ι, we obtain

[formula]

Finally taking the 3rd section, we obtain

[formula]

So it follows that

[formula]

generate [formula], a contradiction to Amar's result, Proposition [\ref=prop_Amar].

Stable rank of [formula]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=Bass_stable_rank_of_A_DS] is a straightforward adaptation of the first author's proof of the fact that the Bass stable rank of the infinite polydisk algebra is infinite [\cite=Mor]. In [\cite=Mor], the infinite polydisk algebra [formula] is the uniform closure of the algebra generated by the coordinate functions [formula] on the countably infinite polydisk [formula].

Fix [formula]. Let [formula] be given by

[formula]

Set

[formula]

We will show that [formula] is not reducible. First let us note that [formula] is unimodular. Indeed, by expanding the product on the right hand side of [\eqref=def_g], we obtain

[formula]

for some appropriate [formula]. Now suppose that [formula] is reducible, and that there exist [formula] such that

[formula]

Let [formula] be such that

[formula]

Applying ι, we obtain

[formula]

Let [formula]. For [formula], we define

[formula]

Then [formula] is a continuous map from [formula] into [formula]. But [formula] vanishes outside [formula], and so

[formula]

This implies that there must exist an r  ≥  1 such that [formula] maps [formula] into K. As K is compact and convex, by Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem it follows that there exists a [formula] such that

[formula]

Since [formula] is zero outside [formula], we see that [formula]. Let [formula]. Then for each [formula], we obtain

[formula]

But from [\eqref=eq_Bsr_1], we know that

[formula]

and this contradicts [\eqref=eq_Bsr_2]. As the choice of [formula] was arbitrary, it follows that the Bass stable rank of [formula] is infinite.
