Abstract: We prove that the tight function introduced Sheffield and Smart (2012) [\cite=She] is a Kirszbraun extension. In the real-valued case we prove that Kirszbraun extension is unique. Moreover, we produce a simple algorithm which calculates efficiently the value of Kirszbraun extension in polynomial time. Key words: Minimal, Lipschitz, extension, Kirszbraun, harmonious.

Introduction

Let A be a compact subset of [formula]. The best Lipschitz constant of a Lipschitz function [formula] is

[formula]

where [formula] is Euclidean norm.

When m = 1, Aronsson in 1967 [\cite=Aronsson3] proved the existence of absolutely minimizing Lipschitz extension (AMLE), i.e., a extension u of g satisfying

[formula]

Jensen in 1993 [\cite=Jensen] proved the uniqueness of AMLE under certain conditions.

In this chapter we begin by studying the discrete version of the existence and uniqueness of AMLE for case m  ≥  2.

We define the function

[formula]

From Kirszbraun theorem (see [\cite=Federer] [\cite=Kirs]) the function λ(g,A) is well-defined and

[formula]

Moreover, (see [\cite=Federer]) for any [formula] there exists a unique [formula] such that

[formula]

and y(x) belongs to the convex hull of the set

[formula]

Thus we can define

[formula]

We say that K(g,A)(x) is the Kirszbraun value of g restricted on A at point x. The function K(g,A)(x) is the best extension at point x such that the Lipschitz constant is minimal. We produce a method to compute λ(g,A)(x) and K(g,A)(x) in section [\ref=numerical].

Let G = (V,E,Ω) be a connected finite graph with vertices set [formula], edges set E and a non-empty set Ω  ⊂  V.

For x∈V, we define

[formula]

to be the neighborhood of x on G.

In Figure [\ref=fig:3.1] we have V = {v1,...,v6}, E = {e1,...,e10}, S(v3) = {v1,v2,v4,v5}.

Let [formula] We consider the following functional equation with Dirichlet's condition:

[formula]

We say that a function u satisfying ([\ref=eq:kirsz]) is a Kirszbraun extension of f on graph G. This extension is the optimal Lipschitz extension of f on graph G since for any [formula], there is no way to decrease [formula] by changing the value of u at x.

In real valued case m = 1, the function K(u,S(x))(x) was considered by Oberman [\cite=Obe] and he used this function to obtain a convergent difference scheme for the AMLE. Le Gruyer [\cite=ELG3] showed the explicit formula for K(u,S(x))(x) as follows

[formula]

where

[formula]

Le Gruyer studied the solution of ([\ref=eq:kirsz]) on a network where K(u,S(x))(x) satisfying ([\ref=eq:nK(u] [\ref=S(x))]). This solution plays an important role in approximation arguments for AMLE in Le Gruyer [\cite=ELG3].

The Kirszbraun extension u is a generalization of the solution in the previous works of Le Gruyer for vector valued cases (m  ≥  2). We prove that the tight function introduced by Sheffield and Smart (2012) [\cite=She] is a Kirszbraun extension. Therefore, we have the existence of a Kirszbraun extension, but in general Kirszbraun extension maybe not unique.

In the scalar case m = 1, Le Gruyer [\cite=ELG3] defined a network on a metric space (X,d) as follows

A network on a metric space (X,d) is a couple (N,U) where N  ⊂  X denotes a finite non-empty subset of [formula] and U a mapping x∈N  →  U(x)  ⊂  N which satisfies

(P1) For any x∈N, x∈U(x).

(P2) For any x,y∈N, x∈U(y) iff y∈U(x).

(P3) For any x,y∈N, there exists x1,...,xn - 1∈G such that x1 = x, xn = y and xi∈U(xi + 1) for i = 1,...,n  -  1.

(P4) For any x∈N, any [formula] there exists z∈U(x) such that d(z,y)  ≤  d(x,y).

In the above definition, U(x) is called the neighborhood of x on network (N,U). Let [formula]. In [\cite=ELG3] Le Gruyer defined the Kirszbraun extension of g with respect to the network (see [\cite=ELG3]) and he proved the existence and uniqueness of the Kirszbraun extension of g on the network. In particular, when [formula] equipped with the Euclidean norm, Le Gruyer obtained the approximation for AMLE by a sequence Kirszbraun extensions (un) of networks (Nn,Un) ([formula]) having some good properties.

Similarly to Le Gruyer's result about the uniqueness of the Kirszbraun extension on a network, in this chapter we prove the uniqueness of the Kirszbraun extension u of f on graph G when m = 1. The graph is more general than the network in some sense since there are many graphs that do not satisfy (P4). Moreover, in the scalar case m = 1, we produce a simple algorithm which calculates efficiently the value of Kirszbraun extension u in polynomial time. This algorithm is similar to the algorithm produced by Lazarus el al. (1999) [\cite=Lazarus] when they calculate the Richman cost function. Assuming Jensen's hypotheses [\cite=Jensen], since this algorithm computes exactly solution of ([\ref=eq:kirsz]) and by using the argument of Le Gruyer [\cite=ELG3] (the approximation for AMLE by a sequence Kirszbraun extensions (un) of networks (Nn,Un) ([formula])), we obtain a new method to approximate the viscosity solution of Equation Δ∞u = 0 under Dirichler's condition f.

In the above algorithm, the explicit formula of K(u,S(x)) in ([\ref=eq:nK(u] [\ref=S(x))]) and the order structure of real number set play important role. The generalization of the algorithm to vector valued case (m  ≥  2) is difficult since we do not know the explicit formula of K(u,S(x)) when m  ≥  2 and [formula] does not have any useful order structure. Extending the results of the approximation of AMLE to vector valued cases (m  ≥  2) presents many difficulties which have limited the number of results in this direction, see [\cite=ELG2] and the references therein.

The existence of Kirszbraun extension

In this section, we prove the existence of Kirszbraun extension satisfying Equation ([\ref=eq:kirsz]).

Let G = (V,E,Ω) be a connected finite graph with vertices set [formula], edges set E and a non-empty set Ω  ⊂  V and let [formula].

We denote E(f) to be the set of all extensions of f on G.

Let v∈E(f). The local Lipschitz constant of v at vertex [formula] is given by

[formula]

where S(x) is neighborhood of x on G.

If u,v∈E(f) satisfy

[formula]

then we say that v is tighter than u on G. We say that u is a tight extension of f on G if there is no v tighter than u.

[\cite=She] There exists a unique extension u that is tight of f on G. Moreover, u is tighter than every other extension v of f.

Let u∈E(f). Let [formula], we define

[formula]

If K(u,S(x))(x)  ≠  u(x) then v is tighter than u.

*Step 1: In this step we prove that for any [formula], we obtain

[formula]

Indeed,

*If [formula] Since v(y) = u(y) and v(z) = u(z) for all z∈S(y), we obtain

[formula]

*If y = x. Since v(x)  ≠  u(x) and v(x) is the Kirszbraun value of u restricted on S(x) at point x, we have

[formula]

*If y∈S(x) we have

[formula]

Therefore, for any [formula] we have

[formula]

*Step 2: In this step we prove that v is tighter than u. It means that we need to show that

[formula]

Indeed, if Lv(y) > Lu(y) then from ([\ref=eq:bt12]) we have Lv(y)  ≤  Lv(x). Thus

[formula]

Since v(x)  ≠  u(x) and v(x) is the Kirszbraun value of u restricted on S(x) at point x, we have

[formula]

From ([\ref=eq:123]) and ([\ref=eq145]) we obtain

[formula]

We obtain the existence of a Kirszbraun extension satisfying Equation ([\ref=eq:kirsz]) as a consequence of the following theorem.

If u is a tight extension of f, then u is a Kirszbraun extension of f.

Let u be a tight extension of f. Suppose, by contradiction, that there are some [formula] such that

[formula]

we define

[formula]

By applying Proposition [\ref=pro:1afd] we have v tighter than u. This is impossible since u is tight of f.

An algorithm to compute Kirszbraun extension when m = 1

In this section, let G = (V,E,Ω) be a connected finite graph, with vertices set [formula], edges set E and a non-empty set Ω  ⊂  V. Let [formula]

We recall some properties of Kirszbraun function introduced in ([\ref=def:k]) which are useful in the proof of Theorem [\ref=theo:chaho].

Let [formula] and [formula]. For each [formula], we use the notation [formula], i = 1,...,n.

(a) (see [\cite=Obe]) We have

[formula]

where i,j are the indexes which satisfy

[formula]

(b) (see[\cite=Federer]) Let

[formula]

then the set

[formula]

is not empty, and K(u,S)(x) belongs to the convex hull of B.

There is a unique Kirszbraun extension u of f on the graph G. Moreover, the Kirszbraun extension u of f can be calculated in polynomial time.

Before proving Theorem [\ref=theo:chaho], we need the following definition

Let G' = (V',E',Ω) be a subgraph of G, i.e. Ω  ⊂  V'  ⊂  V and E'  ⊂  E. Let u' be a Kirszbraun extension of f on G' , a connecting path on G' with respect to u' is a sequence

[formula]

of distinct vertices and edges in G such that

* each ei is an edge joining vi - 1 and vi,

* v0 and vn are in V',

* for 1  ≤  i < n, vi is in [formula], and

* for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, ei is in [formula]

We define

[formula]

We say that c is the slope of the connecting path v0,e1,v1,...,en,vn.

We construct an increasing sequence of subgraph Gn = (Vn,En,Ω) of G and un which is a Kirszbraun extension of f on Gn. We finish the algorithm with a Kirszbraun extension u on G.

Step 1: Construct an increasing sequence of subgraph

We begin with the trivial subgraph G1 = (V1,E1,Ω) where V1  =  Ω, [formula] and let u1 = f on Ω. It is clear that u1 is a Kirszbraun extension of f on G1. The algorithm then proceeds in stages.

Suppose that after n stages we have an increasing sequence of subgraph Gl = (Vl,El,Ω) of G and ul is a Kirszbraun extension of f on Gl for l = 1,...,n.

If there are no connecting paths on Gn with respect to un, we go to step 2.

If there are some connecting paths on Gn with respect to un. We construct Gn + 1 subgraph of G and un + 1 Kirszbraun extension of f on Gn + 1 as follows:

Find a connecting path v0,e1,v1,...,ek,vk ~  ~ (k  ≥  1) on Gn with respect to un with largest possible slope cn.

Without loss of generality, we label the vertices of the path so that un(vk)  ≥  un(v0). We define

[formula]

We will show that un + 1 is a Kirszbraun extension of f on graph Gn + 1 = (Vn + 1,En + 1,Ω).

For x∈Vn + 1, let

[formula]

be the neighborhood of x with respect to Gi.

Case 1: [formula]

We have Sn + 1(x) = Sn(x), un + 1(z) = un(z) for all [formula] and un(x) = K(un,Sn(x))(x) since un is Kirszbraun of Gn . Thus

[formula]

Case 2: x∈{v1,...,vk - 1}.

Noting that Sn + 1(vi) = {vi - 1,vi + 1} for all i = 1,...,k - 1. Moreover, from ([\ref=eq:slope]), we have

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Case 3: x∈{v0,vk}.

We need to prove that

[formula]

(Proving un + 1(vk) = K(un + 1,Sn + 1(vk))(vk) is similar.)

To see ([\ref=eq:haro]), we must show that

[formula]

Noting that un + 1(x) = un(x) for all [formula] [formula] and [formula]. Moreover, since un is a Kirszbraun extension of f on Gn, we have

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

and

[formula]

Therefore, to obtain Equation ([\ref=eq:haro1]), we need to prove that

[formula]

for some x∈Sn(v0).

Let F be the set of slope of connecting paths occurring in the algorithm. Remark that each edges and each vertices entered in our algorithm relate with a slope in F. So that, for any y∈Vn, there exist some x∈Sn(x) and c∈F such that

[formula]

From above remark, to see ([\ref=ine:haro]), we need to show that the sequence of slope of connecting paths occurring in the algorithm is non-increasing. We show this in our present notation. Suppose that

[formula]

is a connecting path on Gn + 1 with respect to un + 1 with slope cn + 1. We need to prove that cn  ≥  cn + 1. We assume without loss of generality that un + 1(w0)  ≤  un + 1(wm).

[formula] If w0 and wm are both in Vn then the connecting path on Gn + 1 with respect to un + 1 is actually the connecting path on Gn with respect to un . Therefore, since cn is the largest slope of connecting paths on Gn with respect to un, we have cn  ≥  cn + 1.

[formula] If w0 = vi and wm = vj for some 0  ≤  i < j  ≤  k. We consider the path through the vertices

[formula]

The slope of above path is

[formula]

Since cn is the largest slope of connecting paths on Gn with respect to un, we have cn  ≥  c. Moreover,

[formula]

thus we obtain

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Step 2: Completing the algorithm

If there are no connecting paths on Gn = (Vn,En,Ω) with respect to un. Then each unlabeled vertex v is connected via edges not in En to exactly one vertex w of Vn. We extend un to the point w by putting un(w): = un(v). This completes the algorithm, and we obtains a Kirszbraun extension of f.

Since each stage adds at least one edge, and each stage can be accomplished by one shortest-path search for each pair of labeled vertices, this algorithm is calculated in polynomial time.

Uniqueness

Let u be the Kirszbraun extension of f defined by the algorithm above and h be another Kirszbraun extension of f. Let v be the first vertex added by algorithm such that u(v)  ≠  h(v) .

[formula] If v is added to a subgraph G' = (V',E',Ω) as part of a connecting path through the vertices

[formula]

with slope c and v = vk.

We can assume without loss of generality that u(v0)  ≤  u(vn). Let

[formula]

We prove that [formula]. Indeed, by contradiction, suppose that [formula]. Since u(v0) = h(v0) and [formula] we must have

[formula]

If h(v2) > u(v2) then

[formula]

Hence v2∈L. This contradicts with [formula]. Thus we must have

[formula]

By induction, we have

[formula]

Since v = vk, h(v)  ≠  u(v) and ([\ref=eq:cmdn]), we have h(vk) < u(vk). Thus if h(vk + 1)  ≥  u(vk + 1) then

[formula]

Hence vk + 1∈L. This contradicts with [formula]. Thus we must have

[formula]

By induction, we have

[formula]

But we know that h(vn) = u(vn), thus we have a contradiction. Therefore [formula]

Let vl∈L. We have

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Set

[formula]

Since K(h,S(vl))(vl) = h(vl), by applying Theorem [\ref=lem:obe], there exists z1∈S(vl) such that

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

We extend path of greatest z1,z2,... such that zj + 1∈S(zj) and

[formula]

This path must terminate with a zm∈V'.

Since Δ > 0, we have

[formula]

Thus zm  ≠  v0.

Finally, consider the path through the vertices

[formula]

Set z0: = vl. The above path is the connecting path on G' with respect to u.

Moreover, c is the largest slope of connecting paths on V' with respect to u, and

[formula]

[formula]

Thus we have

[formula]

The last inequality is obtained by Δ > c. Thus we have a contradiction.

[formula] If v is added during the final step of the algorithm. We call G' = (V',E',Ω) to be the subgraph of G = (V,E,Ω) when we finish step 1 in the algorithm. Thus there are no connecting paths on G' with respect to u. Therefore, v is connected via edges not in E' to exactly one vertex w of V'.

We can find the largest connected subgraph G'' = (V'',E'',Ω) satisfying

[formula]

From the definition of u, we have

[formula]

Since u(v)  ≠  h(v) and h(w) = u(w) = u(v), we have h(w)  ≠  h(v). Therefore, we must have [formula] or [formula].

Suppose [formula] (we prove similar for the case [formula]). Let v0∈V'' such that

[formula]

Set

[formula]

and

[formula]

Noting that

[formula]

Since G'' is a connected graph, there exists a path through the vertices

[formula]

such that [formula] and w∈S''(vn).

On the other hand, from ([\ref=eq:s=s'']) and since h is Kirszbraun extension, we have

[formula]

Thus applying Theorem [\ref=lem:obe] we have

[formula]

In particular, we have h(v0) = h(v1). By induction, we obtain

[formula]

This contradicts with h(w)  ≠  h(v0).

Assuming Jensen's hypotheses [\cite=Jensen], since this algorithm computes exactly solution of ([\ref=eq:kirsz]) and by using the argument of Le Gruyer [\cite=ELG3] (the approximation for AMLE by a sequence Kirszbraun extensions (un) of networks (Nn,Un) ([formula])), we obtain a new method to approximate the viscosity solution of Equation Δ∞u = 0 under Dirichler's condition f.

For any x,y∈V. There exists a chain x1,...,xn∈V such that x1 = x,xn = y and xi∈S(xi + 1) for i = 1,...,n - 1. To any chain we associate its length [formula]. We define the geodesis metric dg of Graph G by letting dg(x,y) be the infimum of the length of chains connecting x and y.

By using induction respect to increasing sequence of subgraph in the algorithm, we obtain the following theorem.

Let u be the Kirszbraun extension of f. We have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Method to find K(f,S)(x) in general case for any m  ≥  1

We fix [formula] and [formula] to be a Lipschitz function. Let [formula]. We denote

[formula]

By applying Kirszbraun's theorem (see [\cite=Federer] [\cite=Kirs]) we have [formula].

In this section, we show a method to compute λ(f,S)(x) and K(f,S)(x) given by ([\ref=def:k]).

We recall some results that will be useful in this section.

([\cite=Federer]) There exists a unique [formula] such that

[formula]

and y(x) belongs to the convex hull of the set

[formula]

Moreover, from the definition of K(f,S)(x), we have K(f,S)(x) = y(x).

To compute the value of K(f,S)(x) we need some properties of Cayley-Menger determinant. We recall some definitions and basic results.

Let [formula]. We define the Cayley-Menger determinant of (xi)i = 1,...,k as

[formula]

A k - simplex is a k - dimensional polytope which is the convex hull of its k  +  1 vertices. More formally, suppose the k  +  1 points [formula] are affinely independent, which means u1 - u0,...,uk - u0 are linearly independent. Then the k -  simplex determined by them is the set of points

[formula]

A 2-simplex is a triangle, a 3-simplex is a tetrahedron.

The k - simplex and the Cayley-Menger determinant have beautiful relations by following theorem:

[\cite=Berger] Let [formula] be arbitrary points in k-dimensional Euclidean affine space X. Then Γ(x1,...,xk + 2) = 0. A necessary and sufficient condition for (xi)i = 1,...,k + 1 to be a k-simplex of X is that Γ(x1,...,xk + 1)  ≠  0.

Let the point u lie in the convex hull of the points q0,q1,...,qs of [formula]. If u' distinct from u, then for some i:

[formula]

Choose H to be the (m - 1) -  dimension (or hyperplane) through u which is perpendicular to the segment

[formula]

Suppose there exist J  ⊂  {1,2,...,N}, f0 inside convex hull of {f(pj)}j∈J and λ0 > 0 such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

then λ0  =  λ(f,S)(x) and f0 = K(f,S)(x).

We have

[formula]

On the other hand, for any [formula], by applying Lemma [\ref=Lemma:twopoint] there exists i∈J such that

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Since Inequality ([\ref=eq:bdtqt]) is true for any [formula], we have λ(f,S)(x)  ≥  λ0. Thus

[formula]

Therefore, we have

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=lemma_2.1234] we have f0 = K(f,S)(x).

A method to compute K(f,S)(x) Recall that [formula]. By applying Lemma [\ref=lemma_2.1234], we have

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

is not empty, and K(f,S)(x) belongs to the convex hull of B.

Therefore, there exist {f(pik)}k = 1,...,l + 1  ⊂  f(S) such that

(I) l  ≤  m, where m is dimension of [formula];

(II) {f(pik)}k = 1,...,l + 1 is a l - simplex. From Theorem [\ref=theo:bergerdet], {f(pik)}k = 1,...,l + 1 is a l - simplex to be equivalent to

[formula]

(III) K(f,S)(x) belongs convex hull of {f(pik)}k = 1,...,l + 1;

(IV)

[formula]

(V)

[formula]

From the above observations, we obtain

There exist {f(pik)}k = 1,...,l + 1  ⊂  f(S) (1  ≤  l  ≤  m, where m is dimension of [formula]), [formula] and [formula] satisfying some following properties

(a) fi1i2...il + 1 inside convex hull of {f(pik)}k = 1,...,l + 1.

(b) ~  ~ Γ(f(pi1),f(pi2),...,f(pil + 1))  ≠  0.

[formula]

[formula]

Moreover, from Proposition [\ref=pro:nume] we have fi1i2...il + 1 = K(f,S)(x) and λi1,i2...,il + 1  =  λ(f,S)(x).

Therefore, to compute the value of λ(u,S)(x) and K(u,S)(x) , we need to find {f(pik)}k = 1,...,l + 1  ⊂  f(S), [formula] and [formula] satisfying the conditions (a),(b),(c),(d). We can do that step by step as follows

*Step 1: For all i,j∈{1,...,N},(i  ≠  j). Let

[formula]

We have fij inside convex hull of {f(pi),f(pj)} and

[formula]

Test the following condition

[formula]

If (i,j) satisfies the above condition, then from Proposition [\ref=pro:nume] we have fij = K(f,S)(x) and λij  =  λ(f,S)(x). We finish. If there is no (i,j)∈{1,...,N},(i  ≠  j) that satisfies the above condition, then we go to step 2.

*Step 2: For all (i,j,k)∈{1,...,N}  ×  {1,...,N}  ×  {1,...,N}. Test the following condition

[formula]

Let A is the set of all (i,j,k) that satisfies ([\ref=eqrqt1]). We consider a (i,j,k)∈A. Thus from Theorem [\ref=theo:bergerdet] we have

[formula] {f(pi),f(pj),f(pk)} is 2 - simplex.

[formula] For any fijk inside convex hull of {f(pi),f(pj),f(pk)} we have

[formula]

We consider the following equations

[formula]

We replace [formula] by [formula] into the equation

[formula]

We obtain that

[formula]

where a(x),b(x),c(x) are function only depending on x and initial data xl, f(pl) for l∈{i,j,k}.

By solving the equation

[formula]

we obtain that λijk is a positive real root of the above polynomial. It maybe that Equation ([\ref=eq1:soga]) have no any positive real root. In this case, we consider another (i',j',k')∈A until Equation ([\ref=eq1:soga]) with respect to (i',j',k') have a positive real root. We call L is the set of all positive real root of equation ([\ref=eq1:soga]).

Let λijk∈L. We find fijk by solving the equations

[formula]

After that, we test the condition fijk in convex hull of {f(pl)}l∈{i,j,k}, and test the following condition

[formula]

If we has a λijk∈L such that fijk in convex hull of {f(pl)}l∈{i,j,k} satisfying Equations ([\ref=eq2:12]) and Inequalities ([\ref=eq2:a12]) then from Proposition [\ref=pro:nume] we have fijk = K(f,S)(x) and λijk  =  λ(f,S)(x). We finish. If there is no (i,j,k)∈A that satisfies the above conditions, then we go to step 3.

*Step 3: By the similar way as step 2 for (i,j,k,l), (i,j,k,l,h),... until we can find a (i1,...,ik)  ⊂  {1,...,N} such that fi1,i2...ik and λi1j2...ik satisfying some following properties

(a) fi1i2...ik inside convex hull of {f(pin)}n = 1,...,k

(b) ~  ~ Γ(f(pi1),f(pi2),...,f(pik))  ≠  0.

[formula]

[formula]

By applying Proposition [\ref=pro:nume], we obtain fi1i2...ik = K(f,S)(x) and λi1,i2...,ik  =  λ(f,S)(x).

By applying theorem [\ref=theo:kirsjfjf], this method terminates when k = l + 1  ≤  m + 1, where m is dimension of [formula]

In step 3, when we solve fi1,i2...ik by considering the equation

[formula]

by replacing [formula] by [formula], for l∈{i1,i2,...ik}, this equation is equivalent to

[formula]

where a(x),b(x),c(x) are function only depending on x and initial data xl, f(pl) for l∈{i1,...,ik}. The polynomial a(x)λ4i1i2...ik + b(x)λ2i1i2...ik + c(x), in fact, is 2 - degree polynomial with variable λ  =  λ2i1i2...ik. Therefore, we can solve Equation ([\ref=ptcq]) very fast to obtain exactly the value of λi1i2...ik.
