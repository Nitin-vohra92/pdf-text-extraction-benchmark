Non-monotonic dependence of the friction coefficient on heterogeneous stiffness

Frictional forces between sliding objects convert kinetic energy into heat, and act in systems whose size ranges from the nanometer scale, as in some micro and nanomachines, up to the kilometer scale, typical of geophysical processes. The microscopic origin of frictional forces is therefore deeply investigated, and strategies to tune their effects are actively sought  [\cite=dowson] [\cite=baumberger] [\cite=capozzaprl] [\cite=rmpvanossi] [\cite=capozza]. In the classical description of frictional processes [\cite=bowden], the transition from the static to the sliding regime occurs as the applied shear stress overcomes the product of the normal applied force and the friction coefficient μ (Amontons-Coulomb law). However, experiments conducted in the last decade  [\cite=fineb2007] [\cite=fineb2010] have shown that this transition is driven by a local dynamics of frictional interfaces, which occurs well before macroscopic sliding. In addition, studies on the systematic violation of Amontons-Coulomb law and the dependence on the loading conditions have clarified that the static friction coefficient is not a material constant  [\cite=SRotsuki2013] [\cite=fineb2011]. This is consistent with numerical studies based of 1D [\cite=Maegawa] [\cite=Braun] [\cite=tromborg2012] spring-block models that have clarified the influence of the loading conditions on the nucleation fronts. In particular they have shown that the friction coefficient decreases with the confining pressure and the system size. While the effect of the elasticity of the slider in the direction perpendicular do the driving one has been recently addressed via the study of 2D spring-block models [\cite=tromborg2011], the role of the elasticity of the contact surface has not yet been clarified.

In this study we show that the elasticity of the contact surface influences the features of the fracture fronts leading to a non-monotonic behaviour of the friction coefficient. These results are obtained via numerical simulations of a 2D (xy) spring-block model (Fig. [\ref=fig:model]a), and are supported by analytical arguments. Our model, fully described in the method section, is a simple variation of the Burridge-Knopoff [\cite=bk1] [\cite=carlson] (BK) model that is commonly used in seismology to describe a seismic fault under tectonic drive, and that reproduces many statistical features of earthquake occurrence [\cite=bk2D] [\cite=bk2Dlr] [\cite=prl2010] [\cite=epl2011]. We will study its properties as a function of the parameter φ = kb  /  Δkd, where kb is the elastic constant of the springs connecting close blocks, and Δkd the variance of the distribution of the elastic constant kd with which each block is coupled to the drive (see Fig. [\ref=fig:model]a). Accordingly, φ measures the relevance of the elastic heterogeneity, the φ  →  0 limit corresponding to a system elastically homogeneous. We show that, even if the Amontons-Coulomb law is locally satisfied for each contact, violations at the macroscopic scale are observed, due to the interplay between the elasticity of the material and the heterogeneity of the local frictional forces. This interplay influences the macroscopic friction coefficient as it determines the ordering properties of the system change under shear: stiff systems keep their ordered structure, while soft systems disorder more easily. We report four different shear-induced ordering regimes, each one characterized by rupture fronts with specific geometric features. The macroscopic friction coefficient [formula] does not vary monotonically with the degree of order of the system or with the degree of elastic heterogeneity: Indeed [formula] exhibits a minimum when the periodic order of the system is broken in the direction perpendicular to the shear, which occurs at intermediate heterogeneities. This leads to a [formula] that is larger both for highly ordered (homogeneous) and highly disordered (heterogeneous) systems.

The dynamics exhibits the typical stick-slip behaviour with phases of slow stress accumulation interrupted by an abrupt energy release. Fig. [\ref=fig:model]b shows for different values of φ the time evolution of the shear stress [formula], where xi(t) is the x-coordinate of the i-th particle at time t. The stress drop amplitude exhibits a power law distribution [\cite=prl2010] [\cite=epl2011] that can be related to the GR law of experimental seismicity. We define the macroscopic friction coefficient as the average over many slips of the steady state shear stress right before failure (symbols in Fig. [\ref=fig:model]b), divided by the confining pressure [formula]. The dependence of [formula] on φ in Fig. [\ref=fig:friction] is clearly non-monotonic, with a minimum corresponding to a ~  40 / % reduction of the friction coefficient with respect to the microscopic value. This minimum is observed for all values of N, and becomes more pronounced for larger N.

Next, we show that the minimum of [formula] is related to changes of the ordering properties of the elastic surface, and, to this end, we consider the φ dependence of the bond-orientation ordering parameter [\cite=nelson]. This is defined as

[formula]

where the second sum runs over all nj nearest neighbors of particle i and θij measures the orientation of each bond at time t with respect to the shear direction. When the configuration preserves its original ordered square lattice configuration Ψ = 1, whereas in the opposite limit of a fully disordered configuration Ψ≃0.5. Fig. [\ref=fig:porder] (inset) shows that as the systems is sheared Ψ(t) decreases from Ψ(0)  =  1 to a limiting value Ψ(  ∞  ). The main panel shows that this asymptotic value is a continuously decreasing function of φ, that approaches its ordered and disordered limits for large and small φ, respectively. This behavior is consistently observed for different system sizes N.

Concerning the dependence of Ψ on the system size N we observe that for φ  ≥  102 the parameter Ψ(  ∞  ) is N independent. Conversely, at smaller φ we notice Ψ(  ∞  ) is a weak decreasing function of N, indicating that the larger is N the more disordered is the configuration. This behaviour can be attributed to heterogeneities of the local stress. Indeed, for larger systems the probability to find local instabilities is higher which favors the occurrence of local rearrangements leading to more disordered configurations. The same argument can be also used to explain the weak decrease of the macroscopic friction with N (Fig. 2a), but does not account for the presence of the minimum in [formula]. Indeed, [formula] is not a monotonic function of Ψ.

Here we show that [formula] variations can be related to the geometrical properties of clusters of slipping particles. We define as "slipping particles" those particles with a displacement in the shear direction larger than a given threshold Sx. We set Sx = 0.01  l and find that particles form compact clusters. The geometrical features of the slipping clusters are determined by their sizes along the direction parallel lx and transverse ly to the shear, [formula] and [formula]. Here, Δxij (Δyij) is the distance between particles i and j along the x (y) direction and the sum is extended to all Nc(Nc - 1) particle couples belonging to a cluster. The normalization factor B = Nc(Nc - 1) / 4 insures that for a cluster involving the whole system lx = Lx and ly = Ly. In Fig. [\ref=fig:scatter]a we present a parametric plot of ly / Ly vs lx / Lx for four different values of φ. Cluster configurations can be distinguished into four classes, determined by φ, whose typical shape is reported in Fig. [\ref=fig:scatter]b. For φ  ≫  1 we have the crystalline regime (C, black circles), represented by symbols with lx≃Lx and In this case, the system behaves as a rigid body and slips involve all particles, keeping the original crystalline order. For smaller value of φ we have the laminar crystalline regime (LC, red squares) where lx≃Lx and ly with values in the range

Methods

We consider a two dimensional BK model, where a layer of particles of mass m is placed on a square lattice with lattice constant l, and nearest neighbor particles are connected by harmonic elastic springs with constant kb (Fig. [\ref=fig:model]a). Each particle i is connected to a plate moving with constant velocity along the x axis by a spring whose stiffness kid is uniformly distributed in the range (kd  -  Δkd,kd  +  Δkd). Δkd is a parameter allowing to control the heterogeneity of the local shear stress. A granular-like approach [\cite=silbert] is used to model the interaction of a particle with the bottom plate. At time t the frictional force acting on a particle is given by [formula], where [formula] is the shear displacement of the particle due to creep motion, and t0 the time of contact formation. Indeed, each contact breaks and reforms as soon as the Amontons-Coulomb threshold criterion [formula] is violated. Here [formula] is the confining normal force acting on each grain, A = l2 the lattice cell area, and μs the local coefficient of static friction. The grain motion is also damped by a viscous term [formula]. Mass, spring constants and lengths are expressed in units of m, kd and l, respectively. We fix FN = 5  kdl, μs = 0.2, ke  =  10  kd, Δkd  =  kd, σn  =  5  kd / l, [formula] and γ  =  0.2  (kd / m)1 / 2. These values insure that simulations are in the quasi-static regime. Periodic boundary conditions are considered in both directions. The number of particles N equals the system size Lx  ×  Ly, with Ly = Lx / 4 and assumes the following values, N  =  100,400,900. We have investigated the frictional properties of the system as a function of the parameter φ = kb  /  Δkd that we vary by changing kb. This parameter measures the relevance of the stiffness of the system with respect to the heterogeneity of the shearing forces.
