On the Gevrey strong hyperbolicity

Introduction

Let

[formula]

be a differential operator of order m defined near the origin of [formula] where [formula] and

[formula]

Here p(x,ξ) is the principal symbol of P;

[formula]

We assume that the coefficients aα(x) are in the Gevrey class of order s > 1, sufficiently close to 1, which are constant outside |x'|  ≤  R. We say that [formula], the Gevrey class of order s, if for any compact set [formula] there exist C > 0,A > 0 such that we have

[formula]

We say that the Cauchy problem for P is γ(s) well-posed at the origin if for any [formula] there exists a neighborhood UΦ of the origin such that the Cauchy problem

[formula]

has a unique solution u(x)∈C∞(UΦ).

It is a fundamental fact that if p(x,ξ) is strictly hyperbolic near the origin, that is p(x,ξ0,ξ') = 0 has m real distinct roots for any x, near the origin and any ξ'  ≠  0 then the Cauchy problem for p + Q with any differential operator Q of order less than m is C∞ well-posed near the origin. In particular, γ(s) well-posed for any s > 1. On the other hand the Lax-Mizohata theorem in the Gevrey classes asserts: Taking this result into account we assume, throughout the paper, that p(x,ξ0,ξ') = 0 has only real roots for any x near the origin and any [formula].

We define G(p) (the Gevrey strong hyperbolicity index ) by

[formula]

Let ρ be a characteristic of order m. Then the localization pρ(X) of p at ρ is defined by p(ρ  +  μX) = μm(pρ(X) + o(1)) with X = (x,ξ) as μ  →  0 which is nothing but the first non-vanishing term of the Taylor expansion of p around ρ. Note that pρ is a hyperbolic polynomial in X in the direction [formula] where [formula]. The hyperbolic cone Γρ of pρ is the connected component of (0,θ) in the set

[formula]

and the propagation cone Cρ of the localization pρ is given by

[formula]

We note that Cρ is the minimal cone including every bicharacteristic which has ρ as a limit point in the following sense:

Let [formula] be a multiple characteristic of p. Assume that there are simple characteristics ρj and non-zero real numbers γj with γjpρj(0,θ) > 0 such that

[formula]

Then X∈Cρ.

Denote by Σ the set of characteristics of order m of p(x,ξ);

[formula]

which is assumed to be a γ(s) manifold. Note that pρ is a function on [formula] because pρ(X + Y) = pρ(Y) for any X∈TρΣ and any [formula]. We assume that

[formula]

We first recall a classical result.

Let p be a homogeneous differential operator of order m with real characteristics. Then for any differential operator Q of order less than m, the Cauchy problem for p + Q is γ(m / (m - 1)) well-posed.

This implies that for differential operators p of order m with real characteristics we have

[formula]

We also recall a result which bounds G(p) from above. The following result is a special case of [\cite=Iv0].

Let p be a homogeneous differential operator of order m with real analytic coefficients and let [formula], [formula] be a characteristic of order m. If the Cauchy problem for [formula] is γ(κ) well-posed at the origin we have

[formula]

for any |α  +  β|  ≤  m - 2κ / (κ - 1).

Assume that p has a characteristic [formula] of order m and that the Cauchy problem for [formula] is γ(κ) well-posed for any Pm - 1. Then from Theorem [\ref=thm:Ivrii] it follows that m - 2κ / (κ - 1) < 0, that is κ < m / (m - 2) which proves

[formula]

We now introduce the assumption of which motivation will be discussed in the next section:

[formula]

Our aim in this paper is to prove

Assume [\eqref=eq:assump] and [\eqref=eq:odan]. Then the Cauchy problem for p + Q is γ(s) well-posed at the origin for any differential operator Q of order less than m and for any 1 < s < m / (m - 2). In particular we have G(p) = m / (m - 2).

Motivation, the doubly characteristic case

In this section we provide the motivation to introduce G(p) and assumptions [\eqref=eq:assump], [\eqref=eq:odan]. Let m = 2 and we consider differential operators of second order

[formula]

of principal symbol p(x,ξ). Let [formula] be the Hamilton vector field of p. The integral curves of Hp, along which p = 0, are called bicharacteristics of p. Let ρ be a double characteristic of p and hence singular (stationary) point of Hp. We linearize the Hamilton equation [formula] at ρ, the linearized equation turns to be [formula] where Fp(ρ) is given by

[formula]

and called the Hamilton map (fundamental matrix) of p at ρ.

Special structure of Fp(ρ) results from the fact that p(x,ξ0,ξ') = 0 has only real roots ξ0 for any (x,ξ').

All eigenvalues of the Hamilton map Fp(ρ) are on the imaginary axis, possibly one exception of a pair of non-zero real eigenvalues.

We assume that the doubly characteristic set [formula] verifies the following conditions:

[formula]

Note that pρ(X) is always a strictly hyperbolic polynomial on [formula] as far as p vanishes on Σ of order exactly 2. We also assume that the codimension Σ is 3 and no transition of spectral type of Fp occur on Σ, that is we assume

[formula]

throughout Σ. The following table sums up a general picture of the Gevrey strong hyperbolicity for differential operators with double characteristics ([\cite=BN4] [\cite=BN3] [\cite=Ni11] [\cite=Iwa2]) where [formula].

This table shows that, assuming [\eqref=eq:fundassum], [\eqref=eq:second] and the codimension Σ is 3, the Gevrey strong hyperbolicity index G(p) takes only the values 2, 3, 4 and ∞   and that these values completely determine the structure of the Hamilton map and the geometry of bicharacteristics near Σ and vice versa.

Let ρ be a double characteristic. Then the following two conditions are equivalent.

Note that the condition (ii) is well defined for characteristics of any order while [formula] if ρ is a characteristic of order larger than 2.

Based on the table, it is quite natural to ask whether the converse of Theorem [\ref=thm:new] is true. That is if G(p) = m / (m - 2) then [\eqref=eq:assump] and [\eqref=eq:odan] hold?

Consider the case Cρ  ⊂  TρΣ that would be considered as a opposite case to [formula]. Here we note

Cρ  ⊂  TρΣ if and only if TρΣ is involutive, that is (TρΣ)σ  ⊂  TρΣ.

It is also natural to ask whether G(p) = m / (m - 1) if Cρ  ⊂  TρΣ, ρ∈Σ. When Σ is involutive one can choose homogeneous symplectic coordinates x, ξ in a conic neighborhood of ρ∈Σ such that Σ is defined by ([\cite=Hobook], for example)

[formula]

Thus by conjugation of a Fourier integral operator p(x,ξ) can be written

[formula]

where [formula]. Thus [formula] for |α| < m and any β. If the resulting p(x,D) is a differential operator so that aα(x,ξ) = aα(x) then from [\cite=Iv0] we conclude that if the Cauchy problem for [formula] is γ(κ) well-posed then [formula] for any |α|  ≤  m - κ / (κ - 1) and any β. This proves G(p)  ≤  m / (m - 1) and hence G(p) = m / (m - 1).

When m  ≥  3 the behaviors of bicharacteristics of p with the limit point ρ become to be complicated comparing with the case m = 2, even [\eqref=eq:assump] and [\eqref=eq:odan] are satisfied. We give an example. Let us consider

[formula]

where a > 0, b are real constants. Choosing b = δa3 / 2, |δ| < 1, p(x,ξ) satisfies [\eqref=eq:assump] and [\eqref=eq:odan] with Σ  =  {ξ0  =  ξ1 = x0 = x1 = 0}, [formula]. Since [formula] we take ξn = 1 and x1  =  ξ0 = 0 in the Hamilton equations so that the resulting equations reduce to:

[formula]

We fix - 1 < δ < 0 and take a > 0 so that 2b / (3a) <  - 1. Then any integral curve of [\eqref=eq:tezan] passing a point in the cone |ξ1| < |1 + (2b / 3a)|1 / 2|x0|, x0 < 0 arrives at the origin inside the cone (see, for example [\cite=Tez]).

Preliminaries

Choosing a new system of local coordinates leaving [formula] invariant one can assume that

[formula]

and hence Σ  ⊂  {ξ0 = 0}. Thus near ρ we may assume that Σ is defined by [formula] where b0  =  ξ0, bj = bj(x,ξ'), 1  ≤  j  ≤  k and dbj are linearly independent at ρ' where ρ' stands for [formula] when [formula]. Recall that the localization pρ(x,ξ) is a homogeneous hyperbolic polynomial of degree m in (x,ξ) in the direction [formula].

The next two conditions are equivalent.

where [formula].

Assume [formula] then thanks to Lemma [\ref=lem:KNsp] there exists [formula]. Since (TρΣ)σ is spanned by Hbj(ρ), [formula] one can write

[formula]

where α0 = 0 because of X∈〈(0,θ)〉σ. This proves ∂x0bj(ρ')  ≠  0 with some 1  ≤  j  ≤  k. Indeed if not we would have X = (x,0,ξ') while denoting [formula] we see Γρ  =  {(x,ξ)|ξ0  >   max jΛj(x,ξ')} and we would have Λj(x,ξ') < 0 which contradicts [formula]. Renumbering, if necessary, one can assume ∂x0b1(ρ')  ≠  0 so that

[formula]

Writing [formula] we may assume bj(x,ξ'), 2  ≤  j  ≤  k are independent of x0. Since p(x,ξ) vanishes on Σ of order m one can write with [formula]

[formula]

Let [formula] be given by [formula] and with [formula] we have [formula] where

[formula]

is a strictly hyperbolic polynomial in the direction [formula] by [\eqref=eq:assump]. Denote [formula] with aα(x,ξ') = ãα(x,ξ') - ã(ρ') and hence we have [formula].

There are m real valued functions [formula] defined in a conic neighborhood of ρ' such that

[formula]

with some c > 0, C > 0.

The first assertion is clear because p(x,ξ) is a hyperbolic polynomial in the direction ξ0. Note that [formula] has m real distinct roots for ζ'  ≠  0 then by Rouché's theorem [formula] has m real distinct roots ζ0  =  λj(ζ';x,ξ') if |ξ' - ρ'| is sufficiently small which are of homogeneous of degree 1 in ζ' and 0 in ξ'. It is easy to check that |λj(ζ';x,ξ')|  ≤  C|ζ'| and |λi(ζ';x,ξ') - λj(ζ';x,ξ')|  ≥  c|ζ'| (i  ≠  j) with some c > 0,C > 0. Since {|ζ'| = 1} is compact we end the proof.

Basic weights (energy estimates)

We first introduce symbol classes of pseudodifferential operators which will be used in this paper. Let us denote 〈ξ〉2γ  =  γ2 + |ξ|2 where γ  ≥  1 is a positive parameter.

Let W = W(x,ξ;γ) > 0 be a positive function. We define S(s)(W,g0) to be the set of all [formula] such that

[formula]

and [formula] to be the set of all a(x,ξ;γ) such that we have

[formula]

for any [formula] with positive constants C,A > 0 independent of γ  ≥  1. If a(x,ξ;γ) satisfies [\eqref=eq:marus] in a conic open set [formula] we say a(x,ξ;γ)∈S(s)(W,g0) (resp. [formula]) in U. We often write a(x,ξ) for a(x,ξ;γ) dropping γ.

Note that g0 and [formula] is the metric defining the symbol class S1,0 and Sρ,δ respectively. It is clear that one may replace (|α  +  β| + |α  +  β|s〈ξ〉-  δ / 2γ)|α  +  β| by |α  +  β|!(1 + |α  +  β|s - 1〈ξ〉-  δ / 2γ)|α  +  β| in [\eqref=eq:bosai], defining the same symbol class.

Since p(x,ξ) is a polynomial in ξ of degree m it is clear that p(x,ξ)∈S(s)(〈ξ〉mγ,g0). Since bj(x,ξ') are defined only in a conic neighborhood of [formula] we extend such symbols to [formula]. Let [formula] be 1 for |t| < c / 2 and 0 for |t| > c with small 0 < c < 1 / 2 and set

[formula]

Then it is easy to see η', bj(y,η')∈S(s)(〈ξ〉γ,g0) and 〈ξ〉γ / C  ≤  |η'|  ≤  C〈ξ〉γ with some C > 0. In what follows we denote bj(y,η') by bj(x,ξ).

We now define w(x,ξ), ω(x,ξ) by

[formula]

Here we recall [\eqref=eq:jikansu], that is

[formula]

In what follows we assume that 0 < δ  <  ρ < 1 such that ρ  +  δ = 1 and 1 < s satisfies 0 < s - 1 < (1 - ρ) / 2ρ.

There exist C,A > 0 such that

[formula]

that is [formula]. We also have [formula].

We first remark an easy lemma.

Let M > 0 be such that [formula] and Γ1(k) = Mk! / k3, [formula] where Γ(0) = M. Then we have

[formula]

Proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:www]. It suffices to prove the assertion for εw with small ε > 0. Thus with w2 = F one can assume that |w|  ≤  1 and there is A1 > 0 such that

[formula]

holds for any α,β. Noting |∂αx∂βξw|  ≤  Cαβw1 - |α  +  β|〈ξ〉- |β|γ for any α,β we choose A  ≥  2A1 so that Cαβ  ≤  A|α  +  β|Γ1(|α  +  β|) for |α  +  β|  ≤  4 then we have

[formula]

Suppose that [\eqref=eq:kinou] holds for |α  +  β|  ≤  k, k  ≥  4 and let |α  +  β| = k + 1  ≥  4. Noting

[formula]

and w- 1  ≥  1, applying Lemma [\ref=lem:aa] we see that w|∂αx∂βξw| is bounded by

[formula]

Since we have w- 2〈ξ〉-  δ|α  +  β|γ  ≤  〈ξ〉-  δ(|α  +  β| - 2)γ  ≤  〈ξ〉-  δ|α  +  β| / 2γ if |α  +  β|  ≥  4 then taking A|α  +  β| / 2 + A|α  +  β|1  ≤  A|α  +  β| into account we conclude that [\eqref=eq:kinou] holds for |α  +  β| = k + 1. Therefore noting w- 1〈ξ〉-  δγ  ≤  1 we get

[formula]

The assertion for ω is proved similarly. As for ω- 1, using

[formula]

the proof follows from induction on |α  +  β|.

We now introduce a basic weight symbol which plays a key role in getting energy estimates:

[formula]

We have [formula]. We have also [formula]. Moreover [formula] for |α  +  β| = 1.

With W = φ  +  ω we put for |α  +  β| = 1

[formula]

We examine [formula] for |α  +  β| = 1. Indeed noting ω- 1〈ξ〉-  δγ  ≤  1 we have

[formula]

Since [formula] one can find A1 > 0 such that

[formula]

holds for |α  +  β| = 1. Since 〈ξ〉- 2δγ  ≤  W similar arguments give

[formula]

Now suppose

[formula]

holds for [formula] and letting [formula] we see

[formula]

Thus it suffices to choose A2 so that A1(A2 - A1)- 1 + C- 1(A1A- 12)  ≤  1 to conclude [formula]. As for (φ  +  ω)- 1 it suffices to repeat the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:www].

We turn to the next assertion. From 〈ξ〉- 2δγ / C  ≤  φ  +  ω  ≤  C it is clear |ψ|  ≤  〈ξ〉κγ log 〈ξ〉γ. Since ∂βx∂αξ log (φ   +   ω)  =  ∂βx∂αξ(φ  +  ω) / (φ  +  ω) for |α  +  β| = 1 and [formula] we see [formula]. Since [formula] for |α  +  β| = 1 and [formula] from [\eqref=eq:kankei] and [\eqref=eq:Wno] it follows that

[formula]

which proves the second assertion.

Composition formula (energy estimates)

In studying Op(eψ)POp(e-  ψ) = Op(eψ  #  P  #  e-  ψ), if ψ∈Sκ'ρ,δ with κ' < ρ  -  δ then one can apply the calculus obtained in [\cite=NTa] to get an asymptotic formula of eψ  #  P  #  e-  ψ, where the proof is based on the almost analytic extension of symbols and the Stokes' formula using a space ρ  -  δ  -  κ' > 0. In the present case ψ∈Sκρ,δ there is no space between κ and ρ  -  δ and then, introducing a small parameter ε > 0, we carefully estimate eεψ  #  p  #  e-  εψ directly to obtain the composition formula in Theorem [\ref=thm:matome:6] below.

We denote [formula] if [formula] uniformly in 0 < ε  ≪  1. Our aim in this section is to give a sketch of the proof of

Let p(x,ξ)∈S(s)(〈ξ〉mγ,g0). Then there exists ε0 > 0 such that one can find K = 1 + r, [formula] and γ0(ε) > 0 for 0 < ε  ≤  ε0 so that we have

[formula]

where p(β)(α)  =  ∂βξ∂αxp and [formula], [formula]. Moreover we have [formula] for |α  +  β| = 1. In particular [formula].

Estimates of symbol eεψ

Let H = H(x,ξ;γ) > 0 be a positive function. Assume that f satisfies

[formula]

for |μ  +  ν|  ≥  1. Set Ωαβ = e- f∂βx∂αξef.

Notations being as above. There exist Ai,C > 0 such that the following holds for |α  +  β|  ≥  1.

[formula]

We have with some A,C > 0

[formula]

Moreover for |α  +  β|  ≥  1, |∂βx∂αξef| is bounded by

[formula]

Notations being as above. We have for |α  +  β|  ≥  1

[formula]

Let ωαβ = e-  εψ∂βx∂αξeεψ. Then there exists γ0(ε) > 0 such that [formula] for γ  ≥  γ0(ε).

Estimates of (beεψ)  #  e-  εψ

Let [formula] be 1 in |r|  ≤  1 / 4 and 0 outside |r|  ≤  1 / 2. Let [formula] and consider

[formula]

where Y = (y,η), Z = (z,ζ). Denoting [formula], [formula] we write

[formula]

After a change of variables Z  →  Z + Y the first integral turns to

[formula]

where we have set [formula].

Let Ψ(X,Y,Z) = ψ(X + Y) - ψ(X + Y + Z) then on the support of [formula] one has

[formula]

On the support of [formula] we have for |α  +  β|  ≥  1

[formula]

The assertions follow from Lemma [\ref=lem:honeone] and Corollary [\ref=cor:kaigo].

Introducing the following differential operators and symbols

[formula]

so that Φ- NLNe- 2i(ηz - yζ) = e- 2i(ηz - yζ), [formula] we make integration by parts in [\eqref=eq:sitamati]. Let F = b(X + Y)(eεΨ - 1), χ*  =  χ(ε  Φ), χ* = 1 - χ* and note |(〈ξ〉-  ργ∂z)α(〈ξ〉δγ∂ζ)βχ*|  ≤  Cαβ with Cαβ independent of ε. Now consider

[formula]

We remark the following easy lemma.

Let A  ≥  0, B  ≥  0. Then there exists C > 0 independent of [formula], A, B such that

[formula]

Applying Corollary [\ref=cor:bb] we can estimate the integrand of the right-hand side of [\eqref=eq:hiseki];

[formula]

Since [formula] on the support of χ*, the right-hand side can be estimated by

[formula]

where we remark [formula] on the support of [formula] and hence we have ωt(X + Y)  ≤  Cωt(X)Θt' with some t'. Noting

[formula]

and

[formula]

we choose N = N(z,ζ,ξ) so that [formula] with a small [formula]. Then noting that Φ  ≤  1 + 2〈ξ〉2ργ|z|2 + 2〈ξ〉- 2δγ|ζ|2  ≤  C〈ξ〉2ργ on the support of [formula] and therefore Φ(s - 1) / 2〈ξ〉-  δ / 2γ  ≤  C〈ξ〉-  ε1γ  ≤  Cγ-  ε1 with some ε1 > 0 we have

[formula]

choosing [formula] small and γ  ≥  γ0(ε) large. On the other hand since [formula] it is clear

[formula]

Set [formula]. Then noting [formula] we have

[formula]

Finally choosing [formula] and recalling [formula] we conclude

[formula]

We next consider

[formula]

Similar arguments obtaining [\eqref=eq:itiban] show that

[formula]

Since Φ1 / 2  ≥  ε- 1 / 2 on the support of χ* we see [formula] and this proves

[formula]

We then consider

[formula]

where F = b(X + Y)(eεψ(X + Y) - εψ(X + Z) - 1) and [formula]. Let κ  <  κ1  <  ρ then since |ψ(X + Y)| + |ψ(X + Z)| is bounded by C〈ξ〉κ1γ and 〈ξ   +   η〉γ  ≈  〈ξ〉γ, 〈ξ   +   ζ〉γ  ≈  〈ξ〉γ on the support of [formula] thanks to Corollary [\ref=cor:bb] it is not difficult to show

[formula]

Choose N = c1〈ξ〉ργ with small c1 > 0 so that

[formula]

is bounded by Ce- c〈ξ〉ργ and 〈ξ〉κ1|α  +  β|γe- c〈ξ〉ργ is bounded by CA|α  +  β|e- c'〈ξ〉ργ. Then noting ωt(X + Y)  ≤  Cωt(X)〈ξ〉t'γ and [formula] for γ  ≥  γ0(ε) and that [formula] we conclude

Let [formula]. Then we have for γ  ≥  γ0(ε)

[formula]

Let us write

[formula]

Denoting F = b(X + Y)(eεψ(X + Y) - εψ(X + Z) - 1) again we consider

[formula]

where χ* is either χ(〈ζ〉〈η〉- 1 / 4) or 1 - χ(〈ζ〉〈η〉- 1 / 4). If χ*  =  χ(〈ζ〉〈η〉- 1 / 4) we choose [formula], N2 = N and noting ωt(X + Y)  ≤  C〈η〉t' with some t'  ≥  0 and |ψ(X + Y)| + |ψ(X + Z)|  ≤  C〈η〉κ1 with κ  <  κ1  <  ρ on the support of [formula] it is not difficult to see that

[formula]

is bounded by

[formula]

Here writing

[formula]

we take 2N = c1〈η〉ρ with small c1 > 0 so that the right-hand side is bounded by Ce- c〈η〉ρ. Noting 〈η〉δ|α  +  β|e- c〈η〉ρ  ≤  CA|α  +  β|1|α  +  β|δ|α  +  β| / ρe- c1〈η〉ρ and 〈η〉κ1|α  +  β|e- c〈η〉ρ  ≤  CA|α  +  β|1|α  +  β||α  +  β|e- c1〈η〉ρ one sees that [\eqref=eq:copi] is estimated by

[formula]

Similarly if χ* = 1 - χ(〈ζ〉〈η〉- 1 / 4) choosing N1 = N, [formula] it is proved that [\eqref=eq:copi] is estimated by

[formula]

Thus taking 1 + δ  /  ρ = 1 / ρ and s + δ / 2ρ  ≤  1 / ρ into account and recalling that 〈ξ〉γ  ≤  〈η〉, 〈ξ〉γ  ≤  〈ζ〉 on the support of [formula] we get

We have

[formula]

Repeating similar arguments we can prove

[formula]

for i = 3,4. We summarize what we have proved in

Proo of Theorem [\ref=thm:matome:6]

We start with the next lemma which is proved repeating similar arguments in the preceding subsection.

Let a∈S(s)(〈ξ〉dγ,g0) and [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

where [formula], R∈S(1 / ρ)(e- c〈ξ〉ργ,|dx|2 + |dξ|2). For a  #  (beεψ) similar assertion, where ( - 1)|β| is replaced by ( - 1)|α|, holds.

We can also prove

Let R∈S(1 / ρ)(e- c〈ξ〉ργ,|dx|2 + |dξ|2). Then we have

[formula]

Let R∈S(1 / ρ)(e- c〈ξ〉ργ,|dx|2 + |dξ|2). Then for any [formula] we have

[formula]

Let p∈S(s)(〈ξ〉dγ,g0). Then one can write

[formula]

where [formula], R∈S(1 / ρ)(e- c〈ξ〉ργ,|dx|2 + |dξ|2) and ωαβ = e-  εψ∂βx∂αξeεψ.

We first examine

[formula]

with [formula]. Indeed since ∂νx∂μξ(ωαβeεψ) = ωα  +  μβ  +  νeεψ thanks to Lemma [\ref=lem:apsiomega] one can write

[formula]

where [formula] if |γ' + δ'| > 0 so that the right-hand side is

[formula]

which proves [\eqref=eq:masa]. Now insert the expression of p(β)(α)ωαβeεψ in [\eqref=eq:masa] into

[formula]

which follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:apsiomega] to get

[formula]

where [formula]. Here we note [formula]. It is clear that p(β')(α')  #  (ωα'β'eεψ) = r'eεψ + R with [formula] for |α' + β'|  ≥  N and hence we get the assertion.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:matome:6]: From Lemma [\ref=lem:matome:3] we see

[formula]

where [formula] which follows from Propositions [\ref=pro:syu:AA] and Lemma [\ref=lem:kore]. Therefore Propositions [\ref=pro:syu:AA] together with Corollary [\ref=cor:rorei] gives

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and

[formula]

Since eεψ  #  e-  εψ = 1 - r1, [formula] by Proposition [\ref=pro:syu:AA] there exists K = 1 + r, [formula] such that eεψ  #  e-  εψ  #  K = 1 if 0 < ε  ≤  ε0 is small ([\cite=Ler], for example). Thus we have

[formula]

On the other hand it is clear [formula] with [formula]. Since [formula] for |α  +  β| = 1 it is also clear that [formula] for |α  +  β| = 1. Note

[formula]

and [formula] which is contained in [formula] if |μ  +  ν|  ≥  1, γ  ≥  γ0(ε) so that

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] for |α  +  β| = 1. Now check ωαβ. For |α  +  β| = 1 we have [formula]. Let |α  +  β|  ≥  2 then ωαβ is a linear combination of terms [formula] with [formula], [formula], |αi  +  βi|  ≥  1. If |αi  +  βi| = 1 for all i it is clear [formula]. If |αj  +  βj|  ≥  2 for some j so that s  ≤  |α  +  β| - 2 then one has

[formula]

Since we can assume γ-  κ  ≤  ε|α  +  β| + 1 / 2 for γ  ≥  γ0(ε) we get the assertion.

Energy estimates

To obtain energy estimates we follow [\cite=KNW] where the main point is to derive microlocal energy estimates. We sketch how to get microlocal energy estimates. Let us denote

[formula]

of which principal symbol is given by pψ = eεψ  #  p  #  e-  εψ  #  K. In this section we say [formula] if [formula] for each fixed 0 < ε  ≪  1. Let [formula] and let [formula] be given. With a small 0 < 2τ  <  ρ  -  δ noting

[formula]

one can assume that Cαβ(ε)γ- 2τ|α  +  β| are arbitrarily small for 1  ≤  |α  +  β|  ≤  N taking γ large.

Symbol of Pψ

Define hj(x,ξ) by

[formula]

There exists c > 0 such that

[formula]

for [formula] where h0 = 1 and 1  ≤  k  ≤  m.

We show the case k = 1. By definition hm - 1(x,ξ - iεω- 1〈ξ〉κγθ) is bounded from below by

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=lem:blow:a] we have |qi(x,ξ)|2 + |qj(x,ξ)|2  ≥  c|b'(x,ξ)|2. Since

[formula]

with some c > 0 because C|b'(x,ξ)|2〈ξ〉- 2γ  ≥  φ2 and ω2  ≥  φ2 and then it is clear that hm - 1(x,ξ - iεω- 1〈ξ〉κγθ) is bounded from below by

[formula]

Summing up over all pair i, j (i  ≠  j) we get the assertion for the case j = 2. Continuing this argument one can prove the case j  ≥  3.

Let us put

[formula]

There exists C > 0 such that we have

[formula]

From [\cite=Br] one has

[formula]

for |α  +  β|  ≤  m which is bounded by Chm - |α  +  β|(x,ξ - iεω- 1〈ξ〉κγθ)1 / 2|ξ||β| clearly. On the other hand it follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:preaa]

[formula]

for 1  ≤  |α  +  β|  ≤  m which proves the assertion. The proof of the second assertion is similar.

Assume that [formula] and [formula] for |α  +  β| = 1. Then for 1  ≤  |α  +  β|  ≤  m we have [formula] and ε|α  +  β||p(α)(β)cβα|  ≤  Cεω- 1〈ξ〉κγh with C > 0 independent of ε.

Let 2  ≤  |α  +  β|  ≤  m then since 1 = κ + 2δ we see by Lemma [\ref=lem:prebb]

[formula]

When |α  +  β| = 1 noting [formula] we get the same assertion. We next estimate [formula]. If |α  +  μ' + β  +  ν'|  ≥  m we have

[formula]

where the right-hand side is bounded by Cεω- 1〈ξ〉κ  -  ρ|μ| + δ|ν|γh. We turn to the case |α  +  μ' + β  +  ν'|  ≤  m. From Lemma [\ref=lem:prebb] it follows

[formula]

then for |α  +  β|  ≥  2 we see easily

[formula]

which also holds for |α  +  β| = 1 because [formula].

Definition of Q(z) which separates Pψ(z)

We follow the arguments in [\cite=KNW]. Let us define p̃(x + iy,ξ + iη) by

[formula]

Then pψ given in Theorem [\ref=thm:matome:6] is expressed as p̃(z - iεHψ), which one can also write as

[formula]

Using this expression we define Q(z) which separates p̃(z - iεHψ) by

[formula]

where [formula]. By the homogeneity it is clear that

[formula]

where [formula]. It is not difficult to check [formula] and [formula]. We study p̃(z - iεHψ) and Q(z) in a conic neighborhood of ρ. We first recall Writing [formula] we see that p̃(z - isζ) is written

[formula]

which is equal to

[formula]

which proves

[formula]

Note that [formula] and hence we have e0(z,ζ,0) = e(z,ζ,0)  ≠  0.

There exist a conic neighborhood U of ρ and a compact convex set K  ⊂  Γρ such that H̃ψ / |H̃ψ|∈K for (x,ξ)∈U, γ  ≥  γ0.

From ψ  =  〈ξ〉κγ log (φ   +   ω) it is easy to see

[formula]

Therefore one has

[formula]

Since |φ  +  ω|  ≤  2ω we can assume ω log (φ   +   ω) is enough small taking U small. In particular we have ω- 1〈ξ〉κγ / C  ≤  |H̃ψ|  ≤  Cω- 1〈ξ〉κγ. Then noting H̃φ(ρ) / |H̃φ(ρ)|∈Γρ which follows from [\eqref=eq:kuri] we get the assertion.

We rewrite Q(z) according to [\eqref=eq:kehi].

Let [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

Noting λ(z)|H̃ψ|- 1〈ξ〉γ  =  ε one can write

[formula]

which is equal to

[formula]

From [\eqref=eq:kehi] the right-hand side of [\eqref=eqnvifoura] turns to be

[formula]

modulo O(λm)〈ξ〉m - 1γ which proves the assertion.

Microlocal energy estimates

To derive microlocal energy estimates we study [formula] where χ is a cutoff symbol supported in a conic neighborhood of ρ. Thus we are led to consider [formula] in a conic neighborhood of ρ. Recall that [formula] where Pj(x,D) is the homogeneous part of degree j of P and [formula] by Theorem [\ref=thm:matome:6]. Take any small 0 < ε*  ≪  1 and we fix ε* and put

[formula]

Let [formula]. Then one can find a conic neighborhood V of ρ and C > 0 such that we have

[formula]

Write [formula] then it is clear [formula] so that [formula]. Thus from Lemma [\ref=levifoura] and [\eqref=eq:kehi] it follows that

[formula]

Since [formula], [formula] one obtains

[formula]

On the other hand noting λ(z)  ≈  ε  ω- 1〈ξ〉κ - 1γ and

[formula]

we conclude the assertion from Lemma [\ref=levithreei] and Proposition [\ref=pro:usimado].

We have [formula] and [formula] in U for γ  ≥  γ0(ε). Moreover |Q|  ≤  Ch with C > 0 independent of ε.

From the definition one can see easily that Q is a sum of terms, up to constant factor;

[formula]

with 1  ≤  |α  +  β|  ≤  m + 1. We also note that [formula] is a sum of such terms [\eqref=eq:shaken] with 2  ≤  |α  +  β|  ≤  m + 1. From Lemma [\ref=lem:logphi] it follows

[formula]

in U and hence [formula] then we have

[formula]

Noting ω- 2〈ξ〉κ - 1γ  ≤  1 it suffices to repeat the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:precc] to conclude [formula] and ε|α  +  β| - 1|p(α)(β)Vβα|  ≤  Ch with C independent of ε for 1  ≤  |α  +  β|  ≤  m + 1. From Lemma [\ref=lem:precc] it follows that [formula]. Since from Lemma [\ref=lem:prebb] one can check that [formula] we get the assertion for S0. The assertion for S- 10 follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:levifouri] and S0S- 10 = 1.

From Theorem [\ref=thm:matome:6] and Lemma [\ref=lem:precc] one can write

[formula]

where [formula] with |r|  ≤  Cεω- 1〈ξ〉κγh and [formula]. Thus [formula] and [formula]. On the other hand Lemma [\ref=lem:preaa] shows

[formula]

so that we see [formula] and |r0|  ≤  Cε3 / 2ω- 1〈ξ〉κγh for γ  ≥  γ0(ε). Therefore in virtue of Lemma [\ref=leviithreea] there is [formula] with [formula] such that

[formula]

in some conic neighborhood of ρ.

We turn to [formula]. From Lemma [\ref=lem:preaa] again we have

[formula]

Recalling that κ  -  δ(m - 2) = ε* > 0 and hence we can assume Cε1 - mγ-  ε*  ≤  Cε3 / 2 for γ  ≥  γ0(ε) so that there exists [formula] with [formula] such that [formula] in a conic neighborhood of ρ. Thus we conclude

[formula]

in a conic neighborhood of ρ with C independent of ε. The rest of the proof of deriving microlocal energy estimates is just a repetition of the arguments in [\cite=KNW] and we conclude that the Cauchy problem for [formula] is γ(1 / κ) well-posed at the origin. Note that 1 / κ = m / (m - 2 + 2ε*) and ε* > 0 is arbitrarily small so that 1 / κ is as close to m / (m - 2) as we please.
