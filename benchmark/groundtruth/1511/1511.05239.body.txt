Introduction

For definitions, see next section and [\cite=BCN]. Let Γ be a distance-regular graph with n vertices, valency k  ≥  3 and diameter D  ≥  2. A minimal idempotent E of Γ, say corresponding to eigenvalue θ, is called a light tail if [formula], where [formula], F  ≠  E0 is a minimal idempotent of Γ, and a,b are non-zero real numbers.

Jurii et al. [\cite=JTZ10] conjectured (see also [\cite=DKT]) that if a distance-regular graph Γ with diameter D at least three has a light tail, then one of the following holds:

a1 = 0;

Γ is an antipodal cover of diameter three;

Γ is tight;

Γ is the halved 2D + 1-cube;

Γ is a Hermitian dual polar graph 2A2D - 1(r) where r is a prime power.

Jurii et al. [\cite=JTZ10] showed that a distance-regular graph Γ with diameter at least three has a light tail corresponding to - 1 if and only if Γ is an antipodal cover of diameter three. If a tight distance-regular graph has a light tail, then it is easy to show that Γ is antipodal (using the fact that tight implies that aD = 0.). In this note, we will consider distance-regular graphs with valency k and intersection number a1 having a light tail corresponding to the eigenvalue [formula]. Our main result is:

Let Γ be a non-bipartite distance-regular graph with valency k  ≥  3 , diameter D  ≥  3 and distinct eigenvalues [formula]. Suppose that Γ is 2-bounded with smallest eigenvalue [formula]. If the minimal idempotent ED, corresponding to eigenvalue θD, is a light tail, then Γ is the dual polar graph 2A2D - 1(r), where r is a prime power.

As a consequence of this result we will also show:

Let Γ be a distance-regular graph with valency k  ≥  3, diameter D  ≥  2, a1 = 1 and distinct eigenvalues [formula]. If c2  ≥  5 and θD  =   - k / 2, then c2 = 5 and Γ is the dual polar graph 2A2D - 1(2).

The authors [\cite=KQ15] conjectured that if Γ is a distance-regular graph with valency k  ≥  3, a1 = 1, diameter D  ≥  3 and smallest eigenvalue - k / 2, then Γ is either the Hamming graph H(D,3), the dual polar graph BD(2) or the dual polar graph 2A2D - 1(2) if D is large enough. We confirm this conjecture when c2  ≥  5.

This note is organized as follows. In the next section, we give the definitions and some preliminary results. Then, in Section 3, we start with a sufficient condition for a distance-regular graph to have light tail, and then give a proof of Theorem 1.1. In the last section we will give a proof of Theorem 1.2.

Preliminaries and definitions

All graphs considered in this note are finite, undirected and simple (for more background information and undefined notions, see [\cite=BCN] or [\cite=DKT]). We denote x  ~  y if the vertices x,y are adjacent. For a connected graph Γ = (V(Γ),E(Γ)), the distance dΓ(x,y) between any two vertices x,y is the length of a shortest path between x and y in Γ, and the diameter D(Γ) is the maximum distance between any two vertices of Γ, and if the graph is clear from the context, we use d(x,y) and D for simplicity. For any vertex x, let Γi(x) be the set of vertices in Γ at distance precisely i from x, where 0  ≤  i  ≤  D. A graph Γ is locally Δ, when for all vertices x the subgraph induced by Γ1(x) is isomorphic to Δ.

A connected graph Γ with diameter D is called a distance-regular graph if there are integers bi, ci (0  ≤  i  ≤  D) such that for any two vertices x,y∈V(Γ) with d(x,y) = i, there are exactly ci neighbors of y in Γi - 1(x) and bi neighbors of y in Γi + 1(x). The numbers bi,ci and ai: = b0 - bi - ci ~ (0  ≤  i  ≤  D) are called the intersection numbers of Γ. Set c0 = bD = 0. We observe a0 = 0 and c1 = 1. The array [formula] is called the intersection array of Γ. In particular, Γ is a regular graph with valency k: = b0.

Let Γ be a distance-regular graph with n vertices, valency k and diameter D. For 0  ≤  i  ≤  D, let Ai be the {0,1}-matrix indexed by the vertices of Γ with (Ai)xy  =  1 if and only d(x,y) = i for vertices x,y of Γ. We call Ai the distance-i matrix of Γ, and A: = A1 the adjacency matrix of Γ. The eigenvalues [formula] of Γ are just the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix A. We denote mi the multiplicity of θi.

For each eigenvalue θi of Γ, let Wi be a matrix with its columns forming an orthonormal basis for the eigenspace of θ. And Ei: = WiWTi is called the minimal idempotent corresponding to the eigenvalue θi, satisfying EiEj  =  δijEj and AEi  =  θiEi, where δij is the Kronecker symbol. Note that nE0 is the all-one matrix J.

The set of distance matrices [formula] forms a basis for a commutative [formula]-algebra A, known as the Bose-Mesner algebra. The set of minimal idempotents [formula] is another basis for A. There exist (D + 1)  ×  (D + 1) matrices P and Q (see [\cite=BCN]), such that the following relations hold:

[formula]

Note that Q0i = mi (see [\cite=BCN]). The Bose-Mesner algebra A is also closed under the Schur product, therefore we also have

[formula]

where the numbers qhij ~ (0  ≤  i,j,h  ≤  D) are called the Krein parameters (see [\cite=BCN]). It is well known, cf. [\cite=BCN], the Krein parameters are non-negative real numbers and also q0ij  =  δijmj holds.

Let Ei = WiWTi be a minimal idempotent corresponding to the eigenvalue θi, where the columns of Wi form an orthonormal basis of the eigenspace of θi. We denote the x-th row of Wi by x̂. Note that [formula], hence all the vectors x̂ has the same length [formula] and the cosine of the angle between two vectors x̂ and ŷ is [formula], where d(x,y) = j. The map x  ↦  x̂ is called a spherical representation of Γ, and the sequence {uj(θi)|0  ≤  j  ≤  D} is called the standard sequence of Γ, corresponding to the eigenvalue θi. As AW = θiEiW = θiW, we have [formula], and hence the following holds:

[formula]

with u0(θi) = 1 and [formula].

A minimal idempotent E is called a light tail if [formula] for some minimal idempotent F  ≠  E0 and nonzero real numbers a,b. The minimal idempotent F is called the associated minimal idempotent to the light tail E. Note that [formula] holds and that if Γ is bipartite, then also [formula]holds, see for example [\cite=P99]. So the eigenvalue corresponding to the light tail E is different from ±  k.

Jurii et al. [\cite=JTZ10] has shown the following result.

Let Γ be a distance-regular graph with valency k  ≥  3, diameter D  ≥  2 and distinct eigenvalues [formula]. Let θi  ≠    ±  k be an eigenvalue of Γ, then

[formula]

and equality holds if and only if Ei is a light tail.

For a graph Γ, a partition [formula] of V(Γ) is called equitable if there are constants αij (1  ≤  i,j  ≤  t) such that all vertices x∈Pi have exactly αij neighbours in Pj. The αij's (1  ≤  i,j  ≤  t) are called the parameters of the equitable partition.

Let Γ be a distance-regular graph. For a set S of vertices of Γ, define Si  =  {x∈V(Γ)|d(x,S) = i}, where d(x,S): =  min {d(x,y)|y∈S}. Then number [formula] is called the covering radius of S. The set S is called a completely regular code of Γ if the distance-partition [formula] is equitable.

The following result was first shown by Delsarte [\cite=D73] for strongly regular graphs, and extended by Godsil [\cite=G93] to distance regular graphs.

Let Γ be a distance-regular graph with valency k and smallest eigenvalue θmin. Let C be a clique in Γ with c vertices. Then [formula], and equality holds if and only if C is a completely regular code with covering radius D - 1.

A clique C in a distance-regular graph Γ that attains the above bound is called a Delsarte clique. A distance-regular graph Γ is called geometric (with respect to C) if it contains a collection C of Delsarte cliques such that each edge is contained in a unique C∈C.

Let Γ be a geometric distance-regular graph with respect to C. As each edge is contained in a unique Delsarte clique in C, we see the Delsarte cliques have size a1 + 2 and [formula], where θmin is the smallest eigenvalue of Γ. And the parameter [formula] (0  ≤  i  ≤  D) is well-defined (see [\cite=G93]), where C is any Delsarte clique of Γ and x is any vertex with d(x,C) = i.

(cf. [\cite=DKT]) Let Γ be a geometric distance-regular graph with valency k  ≥  3, diameter D  ≥  2 and distinct eigenvalues [formula]. Then the following holds:

[formula]

where ui(θD) (0  ≤  i  ≤  D) is the standard sequence corresponding to θD.

A subgraph Δ of a graph Γ is called strongly closed if, for all vertices x,y∈V(Δ) and z∈V(Γ) such that dΓ(x,z) + dΓ(z,y)  ≤  dΓ(x,y) + 1, holds, then we have that z∈V(Δ). A graph Γ is said to be m-bounded for some 1  ≤  m  ≤  D, if for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  m and all vertices x,y at distance i, there exists a strongly closed subgraph Δ(x,y) of Γ with diameter i, containing x and y as vertices.

The following result was shown by Hiraki [\cite=H99], see also [\cite=DKT].

Let Γ be a distance-regular graph with diameter D  ≥  3. Let [formula] and cm + 1  ≠  1. Then Γ is m-bounded if and only if Γ is K1,1,2-free, a1  ≠  0, ai = cia1 holds for [formula] and cm - 1 < cm.

A generalized quadrangle of order (s,t), denoted by GQ(s,t), (where s,t are positve integers), is a K2,1,1-free distance-regular graph with diameter 2 with intersection array {(t + 1)s,ts;1,t + 1}.

Characterization of the Hermitian dual polar graphs

We will give a characterization of the Hermitian dual polar graphs 2A2D - 1(r), where r is a prime power. First we give a sufficient condition for a minimal idempotent to be a light tail of a distance-regular graph.

Let Γ be a distance-regular graph with n vertices, valency k  ≥  3, diameter D  ≥  2, a1  ≠  0 and distinct eigenvalues [formula]. Then [formula] and equality holds if and only if ED is a light tail with associated minimal idempotent E1.

For each eigenvalue θi of Γ, we denote mi its multiplicity and uj(θi) ~ (0  ≤  j  ≤  D) its standard sequence.

By the definition of standard sequence, we have

[formula]

As [formula], the following holds

[formula]

By ([\ref=eq:krn]) and ([\ref=eq:a]), we see

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and [formula].

Since [formula], by ([\ref=eq:b]) and ([\ref=eq:c]), we have

[formula]

Since u0(θD) = 1 and [formula], we see that ũ0 = 1 and [formula]. As a1  ≠  0, we see [formula]. And Lemma [\ref=mbd] implies [formula]. Hence we have [formula]. Note that [formula] and [formula]. We have that [formula], and equality holds if and only if Ẽ  =  E1 and

[formula]

both hold, by ([\ref=eq:c]) This means that equality holds if and only if ED is a light tail with associated minimal idempotent E1, by the definition of a light tail.

The following result is a consequence of [\cite=BKP15].

Let Γ be a distance-regular graph with valency k  ≥  3, diameter D  ≥  2 and distinct eigenvalues [formula]. If c2  ≠  1 and Γ contains an induced GQ(s,c2 - 1) for some positive integer s, then [formula].

As Γ contains an induced subgraph Γ' = GQ(s,c2 - 1), then, by [\cite=BKP15], we see [formula]. The result follows.

The following result follows immediately from Lemmata [\ref=lbd] and [\ref=ubd].

Let Γ be a distance-regular graph with valency k  ≥  3, diameter D  ≥  2, a1  ≠  0 and distinct eigenvalues [formula]. If Γ contains an induced GQ(a1 + 1,c2 - 1) with c2 = (a1 + 1)2 + 1, then [formula] and ED is a light tail with associated minimal idempotent E1.

Since c2 = (a1 + 1)2 + 1  ≠  1 and Γ contains an induced GQ(a1 + 1,c2 - 1), we have [formula], by Lemma [\ref=ubd]. Lemma [\ref=lbd] implies [formula]. These two bounds on θ1 imply that [formula]. Now again by Lemma [\ref=lbd] it follows that ED is a light tail with associated minimal idempotent E1.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Since ED is a light tail with [formula], the graph Γ is locally the disjoint union of (a1 + 1)-cliques by [\cite=JTZ10]. This implies that all maximal cliques of Γ are (a1 + 2)-cliques, and hence Delsarte cliques by Lemma [\ref=clique]. It follows that Γ is geometric.

Note that we have the following equations:

[formula]

where Equation ([\ref=eq:a3]) is from Lemma [\ref=lm:1].

As ui(θD)  ≠  0 for 0  ≤  i  ≤  D by [\cite=BCN] we see that γi  ≤  a1 + 1 for 0  ≤  i  ≤  D - 1. Then Equations ([\ref=eq:a1]) ([\ref=eq:a2]) and ([\ref=eq:a3]) implies the following:

[formula]

Now we assume Γ is m-bounded for some 2  ≤  m  ≤  D - 2. We will show that Γ is (m + 1)-bounded, and this implies, by induction, that Γ is (D - 1)-bounded.

We claim that γi = 1 (i  ≤  m) and ai = cia1 (i  ≤  m).

First, we consider the case cm + 1 = 1. Choose a vertex x and a Delsarte clique C with d(x,C) = i. As γi  ≤  a1 + 1, we can choose a vertex y∈C with d(x,y) = i + 1. We find [formula], i.e. ci + 1  ≥  γi (i  ≤  m). Note that [formula] by [\cite=BCN]. We have γi = 1 (i  ≤  m), which implies ai = cia1 by Equation ([\ref=eq:a4]).

In the case cm + 1  ≠  1, as Γ is m-bounded, by Lemma [\ref=hiraki], we have ai  =  cia1 (i  ≤  m). Note that γ0 = 1. Assume γi - 1 = 1 (1  ≤  i  ≤  m), with ai = cia1, we have γi = 1. By induction, it follows that γi = 1 (i  ≤  m).

As ED is a light tail with associated minimal idempotent F corresponding to the eigenvalue θ'  ≠  k and [formula], by [\cite=JTZ10], we have

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and [formula].

For i  ≤  m  ≤  D - 2, we have

[formula]

by Equations ([\ref=eq:a3]) and ([\ref=eq:a6]), as γi = 1. Substitute ai = cia1, bi = k - ci(a1 + 1) (1  ≤  i  ≤  m) and Equation ([\ref=eq:a7]) into

[formula]

to obtain

[formula]

It follows that c2 = (a1 + 1)2 + 1  ≠  1. Since Γ is m-bounded with m  ≥  2 and c2  ≠  1, [\cite=H09] implies cm + 1  ≥  cm  +  (cm - cm - 1)(c2 - c1) > cm, i.e.

[formula]

Equations ([\ref=eq:a3]) and ([\ref=eq:a6]) imply

[formula]

As Γ is 2-bounded and c2  ≠  1, Lemma [\ref=hiraki] implies that Γ contains an induced GQ(a1 + 1,c2 - 1). As Γ is not bipartite, we see θD  ≠   - k by [\cite=AGT]. And [formula] implies a1  ≠  0. It follows that θ' = θ1 from Theorem [\ref=lt]. Then we have [formula] by [\cite=G93]. From Equations ([\ref=eq:a6]) and ([\ref=eq:b2]) , we see

[formula]

as um + 1(θ') > um + 2(θ').

Substitute Equations ([\ref=eq:a5]), ([\ref=eq:a7]) and ([\ref=eq:a8]) into ([\ref=leq]), we obtain

[formula]

Substituting Equation ([\ref=eq:a9]) into ([\ref=eq:b3]), we see that

[formula]

As γm = 1, by Equation ([\ref=eq:a4]), we see that am + 1  ≥  a1cm + 1. Since m  ≤  D - 2, we see that k > am + 1 + cm + 1  ≥  (a1 + 1)cm + 1 and Equation ([\ref=eq:b3]) implies

[formula]

We see γm + 1 = 1 by Equations ([\ref=eq:b5]) ([\ref=eq:b4]) and ([\ref=eq:c3]). It follows that [formula] by Equations ([\ref=eq:a9]) and ([\ref=eq:b1]), and am + 1 = cm + 1a1 by Equation ([\ref=eq:a5]). This shows that Γ is (m + 1)-bounded by Lemma [\ref=hiraki].

Now we have that Γ is (D - 1)-bounded. Note that γD - 1 = 1. By the same way to obtain Equations ([\ref=eq:a4]), ([\ref=eq:a5]), and ([\ref=eq:a7]), we have

[formula]

Substitute k = (a1 + 1)cD, aD = cDa1 and Equations ([\ref=eq:a7]) ([\ref=eq:c2]) into

[formula]

to obtain that

[formula]

holds. Now we see that Γ is a distance-regular graph with ai = cia1 and [formula]. As Γ has diameter D  ≥  3, by [\cite=BCN], Γ is 2A2D - 1(r) with r = a1 + 1.

Remark. The Hermitian dual polar graph 2A2D - 1(r) is determined by its intersection array for diameter D  ≥  3 (see [\cite=BCN]). The graph 2A3(r) is a generalized quadrangle GQ(r,r2). It is known that for r a prime power with [formula] and r > 2, there are at least two non-isomorphic generalized quadrangles GQ(r,r2)'s, so 2A3(r) is not determined by its intersection array for those prime powers (see [\cite=PT09]).

Proofs of Theorem 1.2

First we establish the following consequence of Theorem 1.1.

Let Γ be a non-bipartite geometric distance-regular graph with valency k  ≥  3, diameter D  ≥  3 and eigenvalues [formula]. If Γ is m-bounded for some m  ≥  2 and c2  ≥  (a1 + 1)2 + 1, then c2  =  (a1 + 1)2 + 1 and Γ is the dual polar graph 2A2D - 1(r) with r = a1 + 1.

The graph Γ is non-bipartite geometric implies that [formula] and a1  ≠  0. As Γ is 2-bounded with c2  ≥  (a1 + 1)2 + 1  ≠  1, by Lemma [\ref=hiraki], we see that Γ contains an induced subgraph GQ(a1 + 1,c2 - 1) and hence [formula], by Lemma [\ref=ubd]. Lemma [\ref=lbd] implies that c2  =  (a1 + 1)2 + 1 and now it follows that ED is a light tail with associated minimal idempotent E1, by Theorem [\ref=lt]. Now, the result follows from Theorem [\ref=dlp].

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Every triangle of Γ is a Delsarte clique and Γ is geometric.

Choose a vertex x and a Delsarte clique C with d(x,C) = i. Then there exists a vertex y∈Γ(x) such that d(y,C) = i - 1. Note that [formula], which implies γi  ≥  γi - 1 (1  ≤  i  ≤  D). So the sequence γi is non-decreasing and 1  ≤  γi  ≤  a1 + 1 = 2.

Then there exists some integer e such that

[formula]

And ([\ref=eq:f]) implies the following

[formula]

As |ui(θD)|  ≤  1 , which implies [formula]. If D  ≥  5, then e  ≥  3. Then ai = cia1 (i  ≤  e - 1) by Equation ([\ref=eq:a4]). Lemma [\ref=hiraki] implies that Γ is 2-bounded, hence it follows that c2 = 5 and Γ is the dual polar graph 2A2D - 1(2) by Corollary [\ref=c2dpl]. The case when 2  ≤  D  ≤  4 follows from [\cite=KQ15].
