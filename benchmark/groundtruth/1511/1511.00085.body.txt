In-situ observation of nucleation processes during organic semiconductor thin film deposition and strain-stabilization of metastable states

Introduction

Methods for solution deposition of organic semiconductor thin films have proven to be far superior to vapor deposition methods in many respects, such as the ability to create oriented films with extremely large crystalline grain size and exceptional carrier mobility.[\cite=wo2008APL] [\cite=minemawari2011inkjet] [\cite=Ishviene2013JAP] [\cite=diao2013NM] However, the crystallization process remains completely unknown, and no clear consensus has emerged on the mechanisms behind the stabilization of metastable states.[\cite=Ishviene2013JAP] [\cite=Diao2014JACS] Classical nucleation theory posits that critical nuclei grow via attachment of monomers from supersaturated solution, while subcritical nuclei tend to thermally dissociate.[\cite=Porter_and_Easterling] However, there is abundant evidence that a two step process, where crystals grow via attachment of subcritical aggregates, takes place in a diverse range of materials systems.[\cite=Gebaur2011NT] Deposition on heated substrates poses an additional challenge since the stable state at the deposition temperature can become metastable once the temperature is changed, typically to ambient conditions. Here, we seek to understand both of these critical steps in the solution deposition process (nucleation and metastable state stabilization) by performing a combination of in-situ and post-deposition characterization experiments.

6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS-pentacene) is one of the most promising organic semiconductors because of its solution processability and excellent device performance. Since the device performance is heavily dependent on thin film morphology and structure, understanding and control the molecular self-assembly in the nucleation process are of fundamental importance. Previous researches showed that room temperature (RT) made TIPS-pentacene thin films have broaden and red shifted absorption peaks compared to TIPS-pentacene in solution,[\cite=James2013ACSNano] indicating absorption spectra can be used as a reliable characterization method to study the structure evolution of TIPS-pentacene thin films.[\cite=Oksana2005JAP] The idea is different molecular packings will affect the electronic couplings between neighbouring molecules, which will result in peak shifts in absorption spectra.[\cite=Kasha1965PAC] [\cite=Spano2010ACR] To our knowledge, only a few references reported in-situ optical spectroscopy study of growth mechanism of polymeric thin films.[\cite=Richter2015AEM] For TIPS-pentacene, so far all the absorption spectra studies are ex-situ, i.e., the characterization have been done on films or solutions that already made.

Studies by differential scanning calorimetry revealed a solid-state phase transition in TIPS-pentacene bulk, occurring at 122-124[formula]C.[\cite=Chen2006JPCB] [\cite=Kazim2015EES] Cour et al.[\cite=Ishviene2013JAP] have shown that strained TIPS-pentacene thin films can be obtained by depositing the thin films at elevated temperatures (60[formula]C and 90[formula]C).[\cite=Ishviene2013JAP] The results indicated that strained film can be obtained after cooling unless the films buckles to relieve the strain. In this way, the metastable phase can be stabilized to RT (metastable here means the phase is equilibrium phase at deposition temperature but non-equilibrium phase at RT). It is reasonable to assume that the high temperature polymorph can be stabilized to RT by the same strategy.

In this paper, we report the application of real-time optical spectroscopy to study the crystallization process and polymorphic transformation of TIPS-pentacene thin films. In IIIA, we ran real-time optical video microscopy and time-resolved optical reflectometry to get the peak positions for the three regions that exist during film deposition: meniscus, supersaturated region and the solid film. For the first time, a red shift of the absorption peaks has been observed in the supersaturated region compared to the meniscus, indicating small aggregates are forming in this region. In IIIB, we deposited high temperature polymorph of TIPS-pentacene thin films at 135 [formula]C and stabilized it to RT by decreasing the film thickness. We also deposited TIPS-pentacne thin films at 25[formula]C and found no phase transition happens even when the sample was heated up to 135 [formula]C. The polymorphic transition was investigated by real-time optical spectroscopy and x-ray scattering and a strain model was proposed to explain the stabilization of the metastable phase.

Experiment

TIPS-pentacene (≥   99 % , Sigma Aldrich) solutions were prepared in toluene (semiconductor grade, 99 %, Alfa Aesar) for RT deposition and mesitylene (98 %, Sigma-Aldrich) for high temperature deposition. Highly doped n-type silicon wafers with a 300 nm thermally grown silicon oxide layer, highly doped p-type silicon wafers and glass slides were used as substrates for the thin film fabrication. The substrates were sonicated in toluene, acetone, isopropanol for 7 min and then treated with phenyltrichlorosilane (PTS, ≥   97 % , Sigma Aldrich) to ensure proper wetting for the TIPS-pentacene solution. PTS treatment was accomplished by immersing the cleaned wafer or glass slide into a toluene solution of PTS (3 wt %, done in a glove bag filled with nitrogen) and heated at 110 [formula]C for 15 h. After PTS treatment, the substrates were sonicated in toluene, acetone and isopropanol for 1 min each, then rinsed with toluene, acetone and isopropanol.

The writing stage includes a microscope system to observe the thin film growth in real-time, a microspectrophotometer (Angstrom Sun Technologies Inc.) to view, select and acquire reflection spectrum over small area, a high precision XYZ stage to translate the sample and a hollow capillary to hold the solution. The schematic of in-situ reflection spectrometry combined with optical video is given in Fig. [\ref=Expt_Layout]. Glass slides or silicon wafers were used as substrates to obtain reflection spectra of TIPS-pentacene thin film. In the hollow capillary writing process, deposition was carried out by allowing the solution held in a rectangular capillary to make contact with the substrate, followed by lateral translation of the substrate at a constant writing speed. [\cite=wo2008APL] A thermoelectric module was equipped for temperature control.

Film thickness were measured with an atomic force microscopy (MFP-3D-BIO). In-situ micro beam grazing incidence wide angle X-ray diffraction (μGIWAXS) was performed at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) on D1-line. The x-ray had a energy of 10.74 KeV and was focused to a beam size of 20×  20 μm using a single-bounce X-ray capillary. The incidence angle was 0.14[formula] and the scattering intensity was recorded using a Pilatus 100 K area detector with a pixel size of 172 μm. High resolution ex-situ grazing incidence x-ray diffraction studies were performed at CHESS on G2-line. The x-ray had a energy of 11.27 KeV with a beam size of 0.2 ×   2 mm and the scattering intensity was recorded by a wire linear detector. Si/SiO2 wafers were used as substrates in all the x-ray experiments. At D1-line, the Si/SiO2 substrates were cut into small pieces with a width smaller than capillary width in order to get a highly uniformed film.

Results and Discussion

In situ monitor of crystalline process

Wo et al[\cite=wo2012JAP] have shown that film morphology prepared by hollow pen writing method is highly dependent on writing speed. At low writing speed (<  0.8 mm/s), the crystallization of TIPS-pentacene is an evaporation induced process which occurred at the contact line. Oriented and nearly single crystals can be produced because the crystallization is seeded by the already-formed crystal as it emerges from the meniscus. At higher speeds (>  2 mm/s), a liquid layer drags out first and dries afterwards, often leading to a spherullitic type grain morphology. At a speed in between, comet-shaped grains are always obtained. In Fig. [\ref=optical], three regions can be seen during deposition process: meniscus (left hand side in the image), solid film (right hand side in the image) and an unknown narrow region in between. This region is overlooked in the past since it is very narrow and totally dark in cross polarized microscopy. The fact that it does not have any color fringes and totally dark in cross-polarized microscopy indicates it is a thin isotropic layer. The width of this region is directly proportional to writing speed, so we were able to put the whole reflection spectrum collection spot in this narrow region under 20X objective lens as shown in Fig. [\ref=optical](d) if the writing speed was larger or equal to 0.4 mm/s. By doing this we were able to get the fingerprint reflection spectra for this region and compare it to the reflection spectra of the meniscus and solid thin film.

TIPS-pentacene thin films were deposited at 0.4 mm/s and 25[formula]C from a 1 wt% solution using silicon wafers as substrates. Real-time optical microscopy video and reflection spectra were taken at the same time. The typical reflection spectra for each region is given in Fig. [\ref=Intensity]. A peak at ~  440 nm is observed for meniscus, supersaturated region, and solid film, which can be assigned to intramolecular excition.[\cite=James2013ACSNano] Three peaks at 549 nm, 593 nm and 644 nm are observed for the meniscus, which is due to single molecule π-π* exciton (also known as fundamental S0  →  S1 transition). Vibronic coupling in the molecule gives rise to a progression of absorption features labeled as 0→  v (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) where v is a vibrational quantum number in the S1 excited electronic state[\cite=yamagata2014JPCC]. The S0  →  S1 transition absorption peaks broaden and red shift if comparing the reflection spectrum of the supersaturated region to the reflection spectrum of the meniscus. The red shifts for 0→  2, 0→  1 and 0→  0 absorption peaks are 5 nm, 11 nm and 15 nm respectively, as shown in Supplementary Table S1. There is further broadening and big red shifts of S0  →  S1 transition absorption peaks when the supersaturated region turns to solid. The red shifts from supersaturated region to solid film are 28 nm, 40 nm and 41 nm for 0→  2, 0→  1 and 0→  0 absorption peaks.

The peak shift is ascribed to intermolecular interactions. Excitonic coupling, i.e., the interaction of transition dipole densities, is very sensitive the the molecular packing and will affect the optical and photo-physical properties of the material. When two transition dipoles are close side by side, their relative orientation (face-to-face vs. head-to-tail) will cause absorption peak shift and materials can be classified into J-type and H-type. J-aggregates dominated by �head-to-tail interactions�, the lower of excited state is allowed and will display a red shifted absorption spectra, as shown in Fig. [\ref=J-aggregate](b).� The sign of the excitonic coupling will determine the direction of the peak shifts and the strength of excitonic coupling will determine the amount of the peak shifts. For �slipped-stack� packing, the direction of the peak shift is dependent on the slip angle. When the slip angle is between 0[formula] and 54.7[formula], the aggregate is J-type.[\cite=Kasha1965PAC] Previous studies reported that many organic semiconductors exhibit J-aggregation.[\cite=Johanne2013JMCC] The molecular structure of TIPS-pentacene is given in Fig. [\ref=J-aggregate](d). When the molecules form aggregates (dimer or trimers), the excitonic interaction between the molecules will result in the excited states splitting. The slip angle between the neighbouring molecules is less than 54.7[formula] so it belongs to J-aggregate. Thus red shifts of absorption peaks are expected when molecules form aggregates, shown in Fig. [\ref=J-aggregate](b) and (d). When the aggregates grow into crystals, the TIPS-pentacene molecules assume a 2D brickwork packing.[\cite=Anthony2001JACS] In this case, each TIPS-pentacene molecule has excitonic interaction with its two nearest adjacent molecules (Fig. [\ref=J-aggregate](f)), which will cause a stronger excitonic coupling that further shifts the absorption peaks. The larger number of molecules in the crystal will also cause the continuous variation of excited states into bands (Fig. [\ref=J-aggregate](c)). In the supersaturated region, a small red shift has been observed compared to the meniscus. This is probably due to small aggregates like dimers or trimers are forming in this region. The aggregates have a size much smaller than the critical nucleus so they keep forming and dissolving.

Metastable polymorph fabrication and stabilization

TIPS-pentacene is a molecular crystal that exhibits a reversible phase transition at 122-124[formula]C. Phase transitions in solids have been classified in several ways. The traditional classifications of phase transitions are first-order and second-order (continuous) transitions. According to the thermodynamic classification, first-order transitions involve a discontinuous change in the first derivatives of the free energy (e.g., volume, entropy) at a definite transition temperature. In second-order transitions there is a change of slope, but no discontinuity in the temperature dependence of the volume or entropy. As far as mechanisms are concerned, first-order transitions are generally believed to occur by nucleation of one phase within the other, followed by its growth.

In order to have a better understanding on the polymorphic transition of TIPS-pentacene, in-situ reflection spectra were used to study the polymorphic transition mechanism. Films were prepared at different temperatures from 25[formula]C to 145[formula]C and the reflection spectra were collected at the deposition temperatures for these strain-free samples, as shown in Fig. [\ref=equilibrium_peak_position]. Since 0→  1 absorption peak (A1) is the strongest among the three lowest energy absorption peaks, its position shift was chosen to study the structure evolution. The most pronounced feature of the reflection spectra is the continuous blue shift of the lowest-energy absorption peak when the temperature is between 25[formula]C and 120[formula]C and the peak shift slows down significantly when the deposition temperature is above 120[formula]C (Fig. [\ref=equilibrium_peak_position](b)). For convenience, we will call the high temperature polymorph Form II and call the films made at RT Form I. As the deposition temperature is increased from 25[formula]C to 125[formula]C, the unit cell parameters of the equilibrium phase of TIPS-pentacene have continuous thermally driven change, causing the continuous shift of the absorption peak as shown in Fig. [\ref=equilibrium_peak_position](b). Another possible explanation for the absorption peak shift is that the band structure of TIPS-pentacene is temperature dependent. But this is hard to be true since we made a thin film of Form II at 135[formula]C and cooled it to 25[formula]C, and we didn't see peak shift as decreasing temperature, as we will see in Fig. [\ref=strained_peak_position]. Some studies showed that temperature will affect the conformational arrangement of the side chains in polymer and cause a polymorphic transition.[\cite=Pan2008M] So it is reasonable to assume TIPS-pentacene polymorphic transition also belongs to conformational polymorphism and driven by the rearrangement of the two bulky side groups in TIPS-pentacene molecule.[\cite=Chen2006JPCB] The molecular packing and side group arrangement are sensitive to the deposition temperature which will cause the distance of adjacent of molecules and the slip angles. As a result, the excitonic coupling is affected by temperature and cause the absorption peak shift. The gradual shift probably means the phase transition around 122-124[formula]C is a continuous transition.

In previous work,[\cite=Ishviene2013JAP] strained lattices can be obtained by depositing TIPS-pentacene thin films at elevated temperatures (60[formula]C and 90[formula]C). If we made a film at high temperature and cool it down, the fully ordered solid film tries to return to thermal equilibrium with the substrate. Since the film is constrained to the substrate it has to crack in order to release stress energy and become the equilibrium phase. For cracks to occur, the strain energy of the film has to be bigger than the cohesion energy. As it is well known, strain energy is proportional to film thickness and strain percentage but cohesion energy can be considered a constant. Thus a thinner film can store a higher strain percentage before it cracks, which means, if we make a film thin enough and deposit the film above the phase transition temperature, it is possible to stabilize the high polymorph to RT by strain effect. In Fig. [\ref=strained_peak_position], a film was deposited at 135[formula]C, with a writing speed of 8 mm/s and a concentration of 20 mg/ml using pure mesitylene as solvent. The thickness was about 26 nm and a glass slide was used as substrate. The sample was cooled down to 25[formula]C and then heated up to 135[formula]C. As we can see, there is only a very small shift in the peak position during the heating and cooling cycle. We also made a film at 25[formula]C with a thickness of 32 nm. The conditions were 4 mm/s writing speed, 8 mg/ml concentration, toluene used as solvent. The Form I sample was heated up to 135[formula]C and then cooled back to 25[formula]C. No cracks can be seen as shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, which matches with the strain model, i.e., the Form I film will tend to maintain Form I unless the film starts to crack or buckle. Diao et al. fabricated TIPS-pentacene thin films at 135[formula] and stabilized the Form II to RT by decreasing thickness of thin films.[\cite=diao2013NM] They also fabricated Form I with a thickness of 30 nm and heated up sample and found that Form I starts to transfer into Form II at 90[formula]C, which is against our results.[\cite=Diao2014JACS]

X-ray studies were carried out to study the structure of Form II, as shown in Fig. [\ref=x-ray]. A thin film with a thickness of 30 nm was fabricated at 135[formula]C on Si/SiO2 substrate, with a concentration of 22 mg/ml and a writing speed of 4 mm/s. It is clearly shown that the film maintained its Form II structure when we cool it down from 135[formula]C to 25[formula]C, which means we stabilized this highly metastable Form II to RT successfully. As we can seen in Fig. [\ref=optical_and_afm], the film is composed of comet-shaped crystals and no cracks can be see when the film was cooled to 25 [formula]C. As a comparison, a comet shaped Form I sample was fabricated at 25[formula]C with a concentration of 1 wt% using toluene as the solvent. The writing speed was 0.8 mm/s and substrate was Si/SiO2. The x-ray data of Form I is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. The a-axis, b-axis and γ values are listed in Table 1. The values are calculated from Q|| of (10L), (01L) and (11L) which are given in the supplementary Table S2. Comparing Form II to Form I, a-axis has a large expansion of 14.4 % and b-axis has a small contraction about 0.5 %. It has been proven that the a-axis of aligned TIPS-pentacene thin film prepared by solution casting method is close to parallel to the deposition direction.[\cite=wo2012JAP] The large positive thermal expansion along the a-axis in an aligned film means cracks tend to occur perpendicular to the writing direction when samples are cooled from high temperature to RT. We also calculated that the change of b sin γ, which is perpendicular to the writing direction, has a contraction of 5.0 %.

To further study polymorphic transition mechanisms, films were made at 125[formula]C with different thickness and then cooled down to 25[formula]C. The solution concentration was 2.1 mg/ml and the writing speed was increased from 0.05 mm/s to 0.3 mm/s. The thickness information is given in the Fig. [\ref=cracking_relaxation] caption. Aligned films can be obtained in this speed range and the thicknesses decrease with increasing writing speed (known as "convective region"). In-situ optical microscopy and reflection spectra were used to monitor the cooling process. At 125[formula]C, all the absorption peak positions were centered at 2.003-2.006 eV (618-619 nm). All the samples were strain-free at this starting point. As the substrate temperature decreased, the cracks occurred (the square markers indicating the cracks occurring time) and peak position started to shift gradually. The final morphology of the films was shown in Supplementary Fig. S8. For the sample deposited at 0.05 mm/s, supplementary Fig. S9 gives its reflection spectra at 125[formula]C, 75[formula]C and 25[formula]C and the FWHM (full width half maximum) values of A1 peak.

A strong correlation between cracking of the film, which releases the strain, and the observed shifting of the absorption peaks shift back to the room temperature positions can be clearly seen, which supports the strain model we discussed in last part. In the strain model, strain effects are considered to be the key factor to drive the molecule rearrangement. When we deposit films at 125[formula]C and cool them down, the surface energy tend to maintain the structure of the initial form. But films tend to contract parallel to writing direction and expand perpendicular to writing with decreasing temperature. Cooling the samples from 125[formula]C to 25[formula]C, the film becomes strained and the strain percentage can be estimated by the difference between deposition temperature and the temperature it was cooled to (ΔTcr). The strain energy is proportional to both thickness and strain percentage. When the strain energy is bigger than the cohesion energy, cracks occur and relieve the strain. When the strain is relieved, it will change the molecule packing and cause an absorption peak shift. Based on this discussion, the maximum strain percentage a film can hold is proportional to the cohesion energy divided by thickness. This is reflected in the Fig. [\ref=cracking_relaxation](a) and (b). Thinner films are more strained when cooled to 25[formula]C, and ΔTcr is positive proportional to the reverse of film thickness. Another experiment has been done to test the strain model. We made one film with a thickness about 740 nm at 125[formula]C and cooled it down to 25[formula]C. Another film with a thickness of 230 nm made at 25[formula]C and heated up to 135[formula]C. The absorption peak shift against temperature is given in Supplementary Fig. S10. As we can see, the peak shifts almost right after heating or cooling, and the peak positions during cooling or heating almost match with strain-free samples. From this strain model we know that when the thickness is large enough, a tiny percentage of strain will give a strain energy that exceeds the cohesion energy, which will cause cracks and relieve strain, thus shifting the peak to equilibrium position during cooling or heating. When heating up a thick film from RT, buckles tend to occur rather than cracks ,as we can see in Supplementary Fig. S11. The grain structure has no change during cooling or heating, which probably means there is no nucleation process during the polymorph transition.

Conclusions

Reflection spectra is proven to be a convenient and powerful tool to study the structure of TIPS-pentacene thin films. In-situ study on growth mechanism shows that TIPS-pentacene molecules tend to form aggregates in a narrow supersaturate region during deposition. Continuous blue shift of optical absorption peaks of the solid film has been observed when the deposition temperature changes from 25[formula]C to 135[formula]C. Both Form I and Form II can be strain-stabilized when the film thickness is about 30 nm.
