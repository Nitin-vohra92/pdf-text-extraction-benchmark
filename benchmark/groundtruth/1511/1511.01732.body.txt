Pencils and nets on curves arising from rank 1 sheaves on K3 surfaces

Introduction

In the past 30 years, one central problem in the study of the existence of grd's on smooth curves has been to find connections between sheaves on K3 surfaces S and linear systems on curves C lying on S. This started with Lazarsfeld ([\cite=Lazarsfeld]) and Tyurin ([\cite=Tyurin]) independently introducing vector-bundles EC,A on S, depending on a smooth curve C and base-point free complete linear system A on C, providing much information on the geometry of the curve C and existence of other linear systems on the curve.

These vector-bundle techniques have given grounds for many results that have emerged lately. Among these, Knutsen has proved that both gonality and Clifford index are constant for all smooth curves in a linear system on a K3 surface, with only one particular exception for the gonality case, and that there exist only two examples of exceptional curves ([\cite=Knutsen], see also [\cite=Ciliberto]); and Aprodu and Farkas proved that the Green conjecture is satisfied for all smooth curves on K3 surfaces, and at the same time found the exact dimension of g1d's for the general curves in a linear system ([\cite=Aprodu-Farkas]).

Lelli-Chiesa ([\cite=lelli2015generalized]) proved a conjecture posed by Donagi and Morrison ([\cite=D-M]), in the case of K3 surfaces without ( - 2) curves, d  ≤  g - 1 and [formula]. The conjecture is stated as follows:

Suppose C is a smooth curve on a K3 surface S, and let A be a base-point free complete grd on C such that ρ(g,r,d) < 0. Then there exists a line bundle D on S, adapted to OS(C), such that A  ≤  D|C and [formula].

Here, the Clifford index of a line bundle A on a smooth curve C is defined as [formula]. We also mention that [formula] (but where [formula] is defined to be 0 for hyperelliptic curves of genus 2 or 3, and 1 for trigonal curves of genus 3). The value ρ(g,r,d) is the Brill-Noether number and is defined as ρ(g,r,d): = g - (r - 1)(g - d + r). A line bundle D on S is said to be adapted to the line bundle L if:

h0(S,D)  ≥  2 and [formula], and

h0(C,D|C) is independent of the curve C∈|L|s;

where |L|s denotes smooth curves in |L|.

The conjecture was proved in [\cite=D-M] for the case of g1d's, and basically involved proving that c1 of the cokernel of the maximal destabilising sequence of EC,A satisfies the conditions of the line bundle D in the conjecture, with the exception of one special case.

Part of the conjecture was also proved by Lelli-Chiesa in [\cite=lelli2013stability] for the case of g2d's on curves on maximal gonality and Clifford dimension 1. There, the idea was to prove that the kernel of the maximal destabilising sequence of EC,A can be assumed to be of rank 1, and that the determinant of the cokernel is the desired line bundle D of the conjecture.

In the proof of our result, we use similar ideas. The main result states that the divisors in base-point free complete g2d's for small d are equal to global sections of torsion-free sheaves of rank 1 on S restricted to C. The torsion-free sheaves arise naturally from a maximal destabilising sequence of [formula], and c1 of these sheaves satisfy the conditions on D of the conjecture, similar to what is done in Donagi-Morrison's and Lelli-Chiesa's proofs.

Our main result is the following:

Let S be any K3 surface, and let L be an ample line-bundle on S. If C∈|L| is smooth and A is a base-point free complete g2d on C satisfying [formula], then the following is satisfied:

There exists a linear system |D| on S and a finite subscheme ξ  ⊂  S such that every divisor in |A| is equal to an element in [formula] restricted to C, where Iξ is the ideal sheaf of ξ.

Suppose furthermore that there do not exist an elliptic pencil E and a ( - 2) curve Γ satisfying both conditions [formula] and [formula]. Then:

The line bundle D found in (a) is adapted to L; and

[formula].

In the case where there exist an elliptic pencil E and a ( - 2) curve Γ satisfying [formula] and [formula], we can construct examples where [formula] is dependent on the curve C in |L|. See Example [\ref=example].

The tools used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=main], can also be used to give a simple proof of Donagi and Morrison's result for the g1d case ([\cite=D-M]). Here, we avoid the special case that was considered in the original proof. Furthermore, as in Theorem [\ref=main], we also here prove that all divisors in |A| are equal to the restriction to C of the global sections of a rank-1 torsion-free sheaf on S.

Let |L| be any base-point free linear system on a K3 sruface S. If C∈S is smooth and A is a base-point free complete g1d on C satisfying ρ(g,1,d) < 0, then the following is satisfied:

There exists a linear system |D| on S and a finite subscheme ξ  ⊂  S such that every divisor in |A| is equal to an element in [formula] restricted to C, where Iξ is the ideal sheaf of ξ;

the line bundle D found in (a) is adapted to L; and

[formula].

We will be working in characteristic 0 throughout this paper.

Proof of theorem

The Lazarsfeld-Mukai vector bundles are defined as follows: Given a smooth curve C of genus g on S and a base-point free, complete grd A on C, the vector-bundle FC,A on S is defined as the kernel of the evaluation morphism [formula]. The bundle has the following properties:

[formula].

[formula].

c2(FC,A) = d.

h0(S,FC,A) = h1(S,FC,A) = 0.

χ(S,FC,A) = 2 - 2ρ(g,r,d) where ρ(g,r,d) = g - (r + 1)(g - d + r) is the Brill-Noether number.

The dual, [formula], is globally generated away from a finite set.

Note that if ρ(g,r,d) < 0, then [formula], and so FC,A is then non-simple, and hence non-stable.

We will for the remainder of this paper - except in the proof of Theorem [\ref=main2] - assume that A is a base-point free, complete g2d on a smooth curve C∈|L| satisfying [formula]. By [\cite=huybrechts2010geometry], FC,A is then unstable, and there thus exists a maximal destabilising sequence

[formula]

such that M is locally free, N is torsion-free and μL-semistable, and [formula].

In the statements that follow, we will also be needing the dualisation of this sequence, which is

[formula]

where [formula] is torsion-free and satisfies [formula]. Since [formula] is globally generated away from a finite set, the same applies for [formula]. This sequence is maximal destabilising for [formula], and so [formula] must be μL-semistable.

The following lemma is needed for the proof of Proposition [\ref=rk2], which (among other things) states that we can assume the rank of M to be 2. This is the most important step for the proof of Theorem [\ref=main].

Let A, C and L be as above, and consider the maximal destabilising sequence [\eqref=maxdestab] of FC,A. If [formula], then M.c1(N)  ≥  0.

Suppose [formula].

We dualise the sequence [\eqref=maxdestab], yielding

[formula]

where Iη is the ideal sheaf of a 0-dimensional subscheme η. Since [formula] is globally generated away from a finite set, then so is [formula], and it follows that a sufficient condition for [formula] to be ≥  0 is that [formula].

Now, since [formula], then [formula], and so it suffices to show that c1(N)2  ≥  0, since it then follows that either c1(N) or [formula] must be effective, and we see that it must be [formula].

To show that c1(N)2  ≥  0, we first consider the maximal destabilising sequence [\eqref=maxdestab], where [formula]. Using that [formula], this gives us [formula], i.e., [formula]. Since we are assuming that [formula], it follows that [formula].

The result follows.

Suppose [formula]. Then N is semistable of rank 2, and so by [\cite=huybrechts2010geometry], [formula]. Furthermore, [formula], and so [formula]. From [\eqref=maxdestab], we hence get [formula], and by Lemma [\ref=mngeq0], this is [formula]. Since c2(FC,A) =  deg (A), which was assumed to be [formula], this gives the desired contradiction.

To prove the first two inequalities of the statement, we consider [\eqref=maxdestabdual] and note that since [formula] is globally generated away from a finite set, then the same must apply for [formula], and so [formula]. By [\cite=huybrechts2010geometry], we must have c2()  ≥  0 as a consequence.

The last statement follows by noting that c2(M) can only be negative if any exact sequence

[formula]

where Iη is the ideal sheaf of a (possibly empty) finite subscheme, and where Di are line-bundles, satisfies D1.D2 < 0. However, since [formula] is globally generated away from a finite set, we can inject an effective line-bundle D2' into [formula], assume that the injection is saturated, and get

[formula]

where ζ is a possibly empty zero-dimensional subscheme and D1' a line-bundle. Since [formula] is globally generated away from a finite set, then D1' is also globally generated (actually everywhere since it is base-component free). But then, D1'.D2'  ≥  0, and if we dualise this sequence, we can put [formula] and get an extension where D1.D2  ≥  0. So c2(M)  ≥  0.

In the proof of part (c) of Theorem [\ref=main], we will be needing the following result:

This follows from the Hodge Index Theorem (see e.g. [\cite=Barth]) and [\cite=Friedman], and using that numeric and linear equivalence are the same for divisors on a K3 surface.

We now give the proof of Theorem [\ref=main].

We begin by proving part (a) of the theorem.

Let A, C and L be as in the theorem, and let FC,A be the associated Lazarsfeld-Mukai bundle. Since [formula], it follows from [\cite=huybrechts2010geometry] that FC,A is unstable, and so we obtain a maximal destabilising sequence [\eqref=maxdestab].

The injection [formula] can be composed with [formula], yielding the following diagram, where G is the cokernel:

[formula]

By the snake lemma, [formula], and since any torsion element of G must map to 0 in A and N is torsion-free, it follows that G is torsion-free. Since [formula], it follows that [formula], where [formula] and Iξ is the ideal sheaf of a possibly empty finite subscheme ξ.

Since φ is injective on global sections and h0(S,G)  ≥  3 = h0(C,A), it is clear that h0(S,G) = 3, and that each global section of A comes from a unique global section of G. The map φ is an element of [formula], implying that either [formula], with [formula], or [formula]. However, we have [formula], and having [formula] would imply that [formula], which contradicts that [formula].

We conclude that [formula], and that every divisor in |A| comes from restricting divisors in |D| to ξ and restricting to C. Proof of part (b):

We recall that D is by definition adapted to L if h0(S,D)  ≥  2, [formula], and h0(C,D|C) is independent of the curve C in |L|s.

We already know that [formula], so the first condition is clear. To show that [formula], note that [formula], which cannot be effective since [formula]. It thus suffices, by Riemann-Roch, to show that [formula]. We have [formula]. Sequence [\eqref=maxdestabdual] gives us [formula] (using Proposition [\ref=rk2] on c2()), and so we can conclude that [formula] is nonnegative (actually, it is [formula]).

We now show that h0(C,D|C) is independent of the curve C in |L|s. By taking cohomology of the sequence [formula], we see that it suffices to show that h1(S,D) = 0. This fails to happen if and only if there exists a - 2-curve Γ such that Γ.D < 0 or D = OS(nE) for some positive integer n and where E is an elliptic curve (see [\cite=knutsen2007sharp]). Since [formula] is globally generated away from a finite set, then so is D (it is actually base-point free, since it is on a K3 surface and has no base-components), and so no - 2-curve can intersect D negatively. In order to prove that h1(S,D) = 0, it therefore suffices to prove that D2 > 0.

To prove that D2 > 0, the top row of [\eqref=diagram] shows that 0 = c1(M).c1(G) + c2(M) + c2(G) =  - c1(M)2 + c2(M) + c2(G). Since c2(M)  ≥  0 by Proposition [\ref=rk2], then c1(M)2  ≥  c2(G). We obviously have c2(G)  ≥  0, and we have c1(M)2 = 0 only if c2(G) = 0, and hence only if G = D, with h0(S,D) = 3. However, in this case, A = D|C, and we clearly see that [formula] where E is an elliptic pencil.

We prove that [formula] for all C'∈|L|s under the conditions of the theorem, given that there exists a curve C∈|L|s where [formula]. Consider the exact sequence

[formula]

If we take cohomology, we see that since [formula], [formula], and [formula], we must have [formula]. If [formula], then [formula] for all C'∈|L|s, and we are done. If [formula], then so is [formula], and by [\cite=knutsen2007sharp], we either have [formula] or there exists a ( - 2)-curve Γ such that [formula]. By assumption, [formula], and so we are in the case where there exists a ( - 2)-curve Γ such that [formula].

We prove that [formula], thus contradicting the conditions of the theorem. If [formula], then [formula] must be a base component of [formula]. However, since [formula], then [formula] (noting that no h2 terms are positive because of the condition [formula]); and Riemann-Roch gives us [formula], which is impossible. Proof of part (c):

We have [formula]. We must prove that [formula] is at most equal to this.

By definition, [formula]. Since [formula], [formula] and [formula], this immediately gives us

[formula]

where we recall that [formula] is as given in [\eqref=maxdestabdual]. We must prove that c2()  ≥  2.

Since [formula] is semistable, it follows from [\cite=huybrechts2010geometry] that [formula]. In part (b) of the proof, we showed that c1()2 > 0 (since D = c1()). And so c2()  ≥  1. In the following, we will suppose c2() = 1 (and hence c1()2  ≤  4) and show that this yields a contradiction.

First note that, by taking cohomology of [\eqref=maxdestabdual] and recalling that h1(S,EC,A) = h2(S,EC,A) = 0, we see that h1(S,) = h2(S,) = 0. Also, since [formula] is of rank 2 and globally generated away from a finite set, it must sit inside an exact sequence

[formula]

where Ri are line-bundles and ν and η finite subschemes. We can furthermore assume that R1 is effective since [formula] has global sections, and R2 is globally generated and [formula] globally generated away from a finite set; and hence R1.R2  ≥  0 and [formula]. Note that [formula]. Also, [\cite=knutsen2007sharp] gives us that h1(S,c1()) = 0.

Case: [formula].

In this case, [formula], and since at least one Ri must satisfy R2i > 0, Proposition [\ref=HIT] yields that R21R22  ≤  0, and so either R21 < 0, or R21 = 0. (If R21 > 0 with R22 = 0, we get R2  =  OS, and then [formula] has no global sections.) If R21 < 0, then also [formula], and so R1 is a base component of c1(). However, since [formula] is globally generated away from a finite set, then so must c1(), and we get a contradiction.

If R21 = 0, then [formula], and putting OS(D1) = R2 and [formula], we get equality in Proposition [\ref=HIT], and so R1  =  OS (since numerical and linear equivalence is the same for line bundles on K3 surfaces). However, in that case, taking cohomology of [\eqref=M-sekvens] gives us that [formula], while cohomology of the sequence

[formula]

yields [formula], so that [formula], a contradiction.

Case: [formula].

This case is similar to the previous case. Here we also have R1.R2 = 0, and in addition, [formula]. Here, we cannot have R21 > 0 with R22 = 0, because we get R2  =  OS, and dualising [\eqref=M-sekvens] would imply that [formula] has global sections, a contradiction. So the two alternatives are R21 < 0 or R21 = 0, as in the previous case. We cannot have R21 < 0 for the same reason as in the previous case. If R21 = 0 with R22 > 0, we get R1  =  OS as in the previous case, and h1(S,R2) = 1. However, since R2 is globally generated with positive self-intersection, this is impossible by [\cite=knutsen2007sharp].

Case: [formula].

In this case, R1.R2 = 1, and since self intersection on a K3 surface is always even, Proposition [\ref=HIT] yields that R21R22  ≤  0. If R21 < 0, then it must be ≤   - 2, and we get [formula], and so R1 is a base component of c1(), which contradicts c1() being globally generated. It follows that R21  ≥  0.

Having R21,R22  ≥  0 implies that [formula], and it follows from Riemann-Roch that either R2  ≥  R1 or R1  ≥  R2. The semistability of [formula] implies that R2  ≥  R1. Since R2 is globally generated, (R2 - R1).R2  ≥  0, and so R22  ≥  2 and c1()2  ≥  4. Since we originally had c1()2  ≤  4 (as a consequence of assuming c2() = 1), equality follows, together with R22 = 2 and R21 = 0. By [\cite=knutsen2007sharp], h1(S,R2) = 0, and since h2(S,) = 0, we get h2(S,R1) = 0, and so [formula] where E is an elliptic pencil. Since R1.R2 = 1, then n = 1.

Note that since [formula] and [formula] is semistable, then [formula] must be a proper extension of R1 and R2. The dimension of isomorphism classes of non-trivial extensions is [formula], and so [formula]. By [\cite=knutsen2007sharp], this implies that either [formula] where E' is an elliptic pencil satisfying E'.E = 1; or [formula] for some ( - 2)-curve Γ, implying that [formula], where m  ≥  1 is an integer and B  ≥  0 is a possibly trivial line bundle satisfying B.Γ  ≥  0.

If [formula], then [formula], a contradiction.

If [formula], note that since R1 = E, then 1 = R1.R2 = E.B + mE.Γ  ≥  mE.Γ. Since [formula] (recall that [formula] is globally generated) and [formula], we get R1.Γ  ≥  1. However, since R2.Γ  ≥  0 (recall that R2 is globally generated), this means that [formula] instead of ≥  0, and we end up with R1.Γ  ≥  2. But then R2.R1  ≥  mE.Γ  ≥  2, a contradiction. We conclude that [formula].

The proof of Theorem [\ref=main2] uses exactly the same techniques as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=main]. We include it here for the sake of completion.

The condition on C and A are that ρ(g,1,d) < 0. In this case, it follows that FC,A is non-simple, and hence non-stable.

Part (a) is proved using the same diagram as in [\eqref=diagram], the only difference being that [formula], and that [formula] and [formula]. The latter inequality implies that N has no global sections, and so φ is injective on global sections. It follows, from the arguments in the proof of Theorem [\ref=main], that each global section of A comes from a unique global section of G, and that the map must be the restriction map to C.

We now prove part (b): Following the proof of Theorem [\ref=main] (b), it is clear that h0(S,D)  ≥  2. We have [formula]. To prove that the latter is ≥  2, is suffices by Riemann-Roch to show that c1(N)2  ≥  0. We have [formula], and so [formula]. Since [formula] and [formula] is globally generated away from a finite set, then [formula] is globally generated, and so [formula], and we can conlude that h1(S,D)  ≥  2.

The argument that h0(C,D|C) is independent of the curve C in |L|s is similar to the argument in the proof of Theorem [\ref=main]. We see that no ( - 2)-curve can intersect D negatively, and so h1(S,D) can be positive only if D2 = 0. We see that 0 = M.c1(G) + c2(G), and so D2 = M2  ≥  c2(G). Thus, D2 = 0 if and only if G = D. As a consequence, h0(S,D) = 2, and so we must have D = E where E is an elliptic pencil. In that case, h1(S,D) = 0, and we conclude that h0(C,D|C) is independent of the curve C in |L|s.

To prove (c), we have [formula]; and [formula], and so [formula], as desired.

An example of a linear system |L| where [formula] depends on the curve C in |L|s

In this section, we give an example of a case where [formula] depends on the curve C in |L|s.

Suppose we have an elliptic pencil E and a ( - 2)-curve Γ satisfying E.Γ = 2. This intersection can occur e.g. when S is the intersection of a quadric Q2 and cubic Q3 in [formula], such that for some hyperplane section H we get [formula] where Pi are planes, [formula] consists of a line [formula] and conic Γ, and [formula] consists of an elliptic curve E. In this situation, Q3 intersects [formula] in three points, [formula] intersects [formula] in one point, Γ intersects [formula] in two points, and hence, Γ.E = 2.

Now let L = aE + (a - 1)Γ where a  ≥  3 is an integer. (We let a  ≥  7 if we wish the condition [formula] from Theorem [\ref=main] to be satisfied, but the example works for all a  ≥  3.) It is clear that |L| contains (smooth) irreducible curves by comparing h0(S,L) with [formula] and [formula], noting that h1 of all of these line-bundles is zero, by [\cite=knutsen2007sharp].

Consider the exact sequence

[formula]

where C is a smooth curve in |L|. We argue that [formula]: Note that this equals [formula], and by [\cite=knutsen2007sharp], [formula] while [formula]. By comparing [formula] with [formula], and using that [formula], we get that [formula].

Now tensor [\eqref=2E-sekvens] with Γ and take cohomology. We see that [formula], and can therefore conclude that the linear system [formula] is found precisely by considering divisors in [formula] that, restricted to C, are zero in [formula].

Note that divisors in [formula] that have Γ as a component, will not cut out any extra divisors in [formula] apart from those already cut out by [formula] on S. We must therefore consider curves in [formula] that do not have Γ as a component, but still cut through C exactly where C intersects Γ.

We now have two situations: First of all, suppose J is a curve in [formula] that does not have Γ as a component. This curve intersects Γ in two points. Since [formula], it is easy to find an irreducible, smooth curve C' in |L| that passes through [formula], and hence, [formula] is an effective divisor in [formula] which is not cut out by a divisor in [formula]. We conclude that [formula].

It remains to prove that there exists a smooth, irreducible curve C''∈|L| where the above situation does not occur. It then suffices to find a curve C'' such that no divisor J in [formula] satisfies [formula]. Consider the exact sequence

[formula]

Taking cohomology, we note that [formula] while [formula], implying that ψ is not surjective on global sections. This means that there is one dimension of divisors [formula] that are not cut out by any of the divisors in [formula]. From the argument above, it follows that any curve C'' that cuts out such a divisor Z on Γ will satisfy [formula].
