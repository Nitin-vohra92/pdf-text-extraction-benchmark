Analysis of the observed and intrinsic durations of Swift/BAT gamma-ray bursts

Introduction

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) were detected by military satellites Vela in late 1960's. [\citet=mazets] first pointed out hints for a bimodal distribution of Tb (taken to be the time interval within which fall 80% - 90% of the measured GRB's intensity) drawn for 143 events detected in the KONUS experiment. Burst and Transient Source Explorer (BATSE) onboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) provided data that were further investigated by [\citet=kouve], and led to establishing the common classification of GRBs into short (T90 < 2  s) and long (T90 > 2  s), where T90 is the time during which 90% of the burst's fluence is accumulated, referred to as the duration of a GRB. The progenitors of long GRBs are associated with supernovae related with collapse of massive stars [\citep=woosley]. Progenitors of short GRBs are thought to be NS-NS or NS-BH mergers [\citep=nakar], and no connection between short GRBs and supernovae has been proven [\citep=zhang5]. It was observed that durations T90 seem to exhibit log-normal distributions which were thereafter fitted to short and long GRBs [\citep=mcbreen] [\citep=koshut] [\citep=kouve2] [\citep=horvath02].

The existence of an intermediate-duration GRB class, consisting of GRBs with T90 in the range 2 - 10  s, was put forward [\citep=horvath98] [\citep=mukh] based on the analysis of BATSE 3B data. It was supported [\citep=horvath02] [\citep=chatto] with the use of the complete BATSE dataset. Evidence for a third log-normal component was also found in Swift/BAT data [\citep=horvath08] [\citep=zhang2] [\citep=huja] [\citep=horvath10]. Interestingly, [\citet=zitouni] re-examined the BATSE current catalog as well as the Swift dataset, and found that a mixture of three Gaussians (3-G) fits the log T90 data from Swift better than a two-Gaussian (2-G), while in the case of BATSE statistical tests did not support the presence of a third component (hereinafter, the log T90 distributions are considered, and are shortly referred to as durations as well). Regarding Fermi/GBM [\citep=gruber] [\citep=kienlin], a 3-G is a better fit than a 2-G, however the presence of a third group in the duration distribution was found to be unlikely [\citep=Tarnopolski] [\citep=Tarnopolski2], which was based on the fact that the log T90 distribution is bimodal, i.e. it exhibits two local maxima [\citep=Tarnopolski], and that a mixture of two skewed components follows the data better than a standard three-Gaussian [\citep=Tarnopolski2].

The Swift data were re-examined by [\citet=bromberg], and they found that a limit of 0.8  s is more suitable for the GRBs observed by Swift than the conventional 2  s limit of [\citet=kouve]. It should be stressed that [\citet=bromberg] applied a different approach than [\citet=kouve] and [\citet=Tarnopolski3]: a functional form of the T90 distribution different from the commonly used phenomenological log-normal distribution, coming from a physical model for the short duration collapsar distribution, and by means of exceeding a probability threshold that a GRB with a given T90 is a non-collapsar. Interestingly, the limits for BATSE and Fermi data are consistent with the 2  s limit, and also with the results obtained by [\citet=Tarnopolski3], where based on the well-established conjecture that durations T90 are log-normally distributed, the limit between short and long GRBs may be placed at the local minimum, which is detector-dependent. Finally, many works in which a 2-G was fitted to the log T90 distribution showed a significant overlap of components corresponding to short and long GRBs [\citep=mcbreen] [\citep=koshut] [\citep=horvath02] [\citep=zhang2] [\citep=huja] [\citep=bromberg] [\citep=barnacka] [\citep=Tarnopolski3] [\citep=zitouni].

The aim of this paper is to analyze the current dataset of Swift/BAT GRBs, and to test whether a greater sample of 947 events leads to conclusions other than [\citet=zitouni] arrived at for a set of 757 events. Moreover, a relevant increase of GRBs with measured redshift--347 compared to 248 GRBs examined by [\citet=zitouni]--provides an opportunity for a re-evaluation of the GRB properties that are, after moving to the rest frame, not affected by cosmological factors. This paper is organized in the following manner. In Section [\ref=meth] the datasets, fitting method and statistical criteria used to infer the validity of the models applied are described. Section [\ref=res] presents the results of fitting a 2-G and 3-G to the whole sample of 947 GRBs, as well as a subsample of 347 events in both the observer and rest frames. Section [\ref=disc] is devoted to discussion, and gathers concluding remarks.

Methods

Dataset

The Swift dataset contains 947 GRBs with measured duration T90, of which 9% are short (87 events). 347 GRBs have their redshift known, and those constitute the second sample examined herein. It consists of 324 long GRBs and 23 short ones. A scatter plot of this subsample on a log T90 - z plane is drawn in Fig. [\ref=fig1]. The median redshift for short and long GRBs is equal to short = 0.72 and long = 1.90, respectively. The intrinsic durations are calculated according to

[formula]

Distributions of the log T90 for the observed and intrinsic durations are examined hereinafter, and are displayed together with the distribution of the whole sample in Fig. [\ref=fig2].

Fitting method

Two standard fitting techniques are commonly applied: χ2 fitting [\citep=voinov] and maximum likelihood (ML, [\citealt=kendall]). For the first, data needs to be binned, and despite various binning rules are known (e.g. Freedman-Diaconis, Scott, Knuth etc.), they still leave place for ambiguity, as it might happen that the fit may be statistically significant on a given significance level for a number of binnings [\citep=huja] [\citep=koen] [\citep=Tarnopolski]. The ML method is not affected by this issue and is therefore applied herein. However, for display purposes, the binning was chosen based on the Freedman-Diaconis rule.

Having a distribution with a probability density function (PDF) given by f = f(x;θ) (possibly a mixture), where [formula] is a set of parameters, the log-likelihood function is defined as

[formula]

where [formula] are the datapoints from the sample to which a distribution is fitted. The fitting is performed by searching a set of parameters [formula] for which the log-likelihood is maximized. When nested models are considered, the maximal value of the log-likelihood function [formula] increases when the number of parameters p increases.

A mixture of k standard normal (Gaussian) distributions:

[formula]

is considered. It is described by p = 3k - 1 free parameters: k pairs (μi,σi) and k - 1 weights Ai, satysfying [formula] due to normalization of a PDF. Therefore, p = 5 for a 2-G, and p = 8 for a 3-G.

Statistical criteria

If one has two fits such that Lp2, max  >  Lp1, max, then twice their difference, 2ΔL max = 2(Lp2, max  -  Lp1, max), is distributed like χ2(Δp), where Δp = p2 - p1 > 0 is the difference in the number of parameters [\citep=kendall] [\citep=horvath02]. If a p-value associated with the value of χ2(Δp) does not exceed the significance level α, one of the fits (with higher L max) is statistically better than the other. For instance, for a 2-G and a 3-G, Δp = 3, and despite that, according to Footnote [\ref=fn1], Lmax,  3 - G  >  Lmax,  2 - G holds always, twice their difference provides a decisive p-value.

For nested as well as non-nested models, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) [\citep=akaike] [\citep=burnham] [\citep=liddle] may be applied. The AIC is defined as

[formula]

A preferred model is the one that minimizes AIC. The formulation of AIC penalizes the use of an excessive number of parameters, hence discourages overfitting. It prefers models with fewer parameters, as long as the others do not provide a substantially better fit. The expression for AIC consists of two competing terms: the first measuring the model complexity (number of free parameters), and the second measuring the goodness of fit (or more precisely, the lack of thereof). Among candidate models with AICi, let AIC min denote the smallest. Then,

[formula]

where Δi = AICi - AIC min, can be interpreted as the relative (compared to AIC min) probability that the ith model minimizes the AIC.

The AIC is suitable when N / p is large, i.e. when N / p > 40 [\citep=burnham]. When this condition is not fulfilled, a second order bias correction is introduced, resulting in a small-sample version of the AIC, called AICc:

[formula]

The relative probability is computed similarly to when AIC is used, i.e. Eq. ([\ref=eq4]) is valid when one takes Δi = AICc,i - AICc, min. Thence,

[formula]

Obviously, AICc converges to AIC when N is large.

It is important to note that this method allows to choose a model that is best among a given set, but does not allow to state that this model is the best among all possible ones. Hence, the probabilities computed by means of Eq. ([\ref=eq6]) are the relative (with respect to a model with AICc, min) probabilities that the data is better described by a model with AICc,i. What is essential in assesing the goodness of a fit in the AIC method is the difference, Δi = AICc,i - AICc, min, not the absolute value of an AICc,i. If Δi < 2, then there is substantial support for the ith model, and the proposition that it is a proper description is highly probable. If 2 < Δi < 4, then there is strong support for the ith model. When 4 < Δi < 7, there is considerably less support, and models with Δi > 10 have essentially no support [\citep=burnham].

The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was introduced by [\citet=schwarz], and is defined as

[formula]

As was the case in the AIC (or AICc), a preferred model is the one that minimizes BIC, which also penalizes the usage of an excessive number of free parameters. The most striking difference between the two is that the penalization term, k ln N, is greater than the corresponding term from the AIC, i.e. 2p, for N  ≥  8. Hence, the penalization in case of the BIC is much more stringent, especially for large samples.

The probability in favor of the ith model, relative to a model with BIC min, is defined in the same manner as it was for AIC:

[formula]

where Δi = BICi - BIC min in this case, and the support for the ith model (or evidence against it) also depends on the differences: if Δi < 2, then there is substantial support for the ith model (or the evidence against it is worth only a bare mention). When 2 < Δi < 6, then there is positive evidence against the ith model. If 6 < Δi < 10, the evidence is strong, and models with Δi > 10 yield a very strong evidence against the ith model (essentially no support, [\citealt=kass]).

Despite apparent similarities between the AIC and BIC, they answer different questions, as they are derived based on different assumptions. AIC tries to select a model that most adequately describes reality (in the form of the data under examination). This means that in fact the model being a real description of the data is never considered. On the contrary, BIC tries to find the true model among the set of candidates. Because BIC is more stringent, it has a tendency to underfit, while AIC, as a more liberal method, is inclined towards overfitting. This leads sometimes to pointing different models by the two criteria, which happens rarely, but is due to the fact that they try to satisfy different conditions.

Results

All Swift GRBs

Using the ML method from Sect. [\ref=fit], the fitting of a 2-G and 3-G to the duration distribution of 947 GRBs is performed. The results, in graphical form, are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig3]. The two-component mixture is unimodal, but with a prominent tail on the left side. The three-component fit is bimodal, with a clear shoulder on the left side of the peak related to long GRBs. The local minimum is placed at T90 = 1.07  s. It is interesting to note that this value is consistent with the short-long GRB limit from [\citet=bromberg]. The overall shape of the curve is in agreement with previous results [\citep=horvath08] [\citep=zhang2] [\citep=Tarnopolski2] [\citep=zitouni].

The parameters of the fits are gathered in Table [\ref=tbl1]. Twice the difference in Lp, max is equal to 22.336, what corresponds to a p-value of 6  ×  10- 5, indicating that a 3-G is a highly significant improvement over a 2-G. This is confirmed with the AICc approach, as their difference is equal to 16.246, what gives a probability of 3  ×  10- 4 that the 2-G might in fact be a better description than a 3-G. However, the results of the BIC give a much lower significance--the difference is only 1.776, corresponding to a probability of 0.41 in favor of the 2-G. Nevertheless, all criteria pointed at a 3-G as a better model among the two under consideration.

Subsample of Swift GRBs with measured redshift

Observed durations

The observed durations of the redshift-equipped GRB subsample are examined in the same way as in the previous Section [\ref=res1]. The fitted curves, displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig4], resemble the ones obtained for the complete GRB sample. The fitted parameters, gathered in Table [\ref=tbl2], are in good agreement, too. The difference in Lp, max multiplied by two, being equal to 6.522, corresponds to a relatively high probability of 0.09. The difference in AICc, equal to 0.270, is negligible, and hence based on it one can not rule out any of the fits--the relative probability is 0.87. On the other hand, the lower BIC was achieved by a 2-G, and the difference is a prominent 11.027, which gives a probability of 4  ×  10- 3. Hence, the overall evidence against a 3-G is very strong--it follows that based on BIC, a 2-G is a better model.

Intrinsic durations

In the case of the intrinsic durations, the fits displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig5] reveal a systematic shift, compared to the distribution of Tobs90, towards shorter durations. While a 2-G is again unimodal and skewed leftwards, the 3-G shows a peak at T90 = 1.42  s, between the regions of short and long GRBs. The parameters of the fits are gathered in Table [\ref=tbl3].

The doubled difference of Lp, max is equal to 1.504, what implies a high relative probability of 0.68. The difference in AICc is 4.747, what hints toward a 2-G with a relative probability of 0.09 that a 3-G is in fact a better model. In this case, the BIC yield a difference of 16.045, which gives a strong support in favor of a 2-G. The relative probability that the 3-G might be the more appropriate description of the data, is only 3  ×  10- 4. Overall, the AICc and BIC are in agreement, and without taking into account the doubled difference of Lp, max, because it provides no evidence in favor of any model, it turns out that a 2-G is a better model than a 3-G.

Discussion and conclusions

The duration distribution of 947 GRBs observed by Swift, and a subsample consisting of 347 events with measured redshift, were investigated. The redshifts allowed to examine the intrinsic durations, i.e. in the rest frame, as well. Mixtures of two and three standard Gaussians were fitted. For each sample, the best fit was chosen based on the value of the difference in the log-likelihoods doubled, Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion. The main conclusions are as follows:

All three criteria point at a 3-G as an adequate description of the log T90 distribution of all 947 Swift GRBs. The fit is bimodal, what is in good agreement with the two well established populations (mergers for short, and collapsars for long GRBs). This might suggest that the commonly applied log-normal distribution is not a good model for the observed duration distribution.

For a subsample of 347 GRBs with measured redshift, the analyses of the observed and intrinsic durations yielded results being in quite good agreement. While only the BIC hints at a unimodal 2-G in the case of log Tobs90, the other two criteria did not yield support for any of the models strong enough to infer their plausibility, but with a low ratio of short to long GRBs (< 1:14) in this Swift subsample, combined with the well known overlap of durations of short and long GRBs and the relative smallness of the subsample, this is not that surprising.

The intrinsic durations, log Tint90, are best described by a unimodal 2-G, too. Both AICc and BIC yield strong support in favor of a two-component Gaussian, while the criterion based on log-likelihoods did not provide a conclusive outcome. Hence, in all three samples the presence of two populations was found to be likely, and the evidence against a three-component description is strong.

In case of Tobs90 in the redshift-equipped subsample of 347 GRBs, the AICc and BIC lead to different conclusions: the AICc pointed at a 3-G (with very weak evidence against a 2-G though), and BIC yielded a very strong support for the 2-G. While this seems to be contradictive, it needs to be interpreted in the context of each criterion: according to AICc, a 3-G is a slightly better choice in describing the data, and because the difference in the models is negligible, the BIC strongly favors the simpler one, i.e. the one with fewer parameters. This illustrates that any statistical criterion can not be a stand-alone determinant in inferring the underlying model, but (i) needs to be interpreted in the light of its conditions, and (ii) it is useful to apply different tools and analyze their output in relation to each other.
