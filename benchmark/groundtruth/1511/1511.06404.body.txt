Bounded tiles in [formula] are compact open sets

Introduction

Let G be a locally compact abelian group and let Ω  ⊂  G be a Borel set of positive and finite Haar measure. We say that the set Ω is a tile of G if there exists a set T  ⊂  G of translates such that [formula] for almost all x∈G, where 1A denotes the indicator function of a set A. Such a set T is called a tiling complement of Ω and (Ω,T) is called a tiling pair.

In the case of [formula] considered as an additive group, compact sets of positive measure that tile [formula] by translation were extensively studied. The simplest case concerns compact sets consisting of finite number of unit intervals all of whose endpoints are integers. This tiling problem can be reformulated in terms of finite subsets of [formula] which tile the group [formula]. See [\cite=Tijdeman] for references on the study of tiling problem in the group [formula]. There are also investigations on the existence of tiles having infinitely many connected components. For example, self-affine tiles are studied by Bandt [\cite=Ban], Gröchenig and Haas [\cite=GH94], Kenyon [\cite=kenyonthesis], Lagarias and Wang [\cite=Lagarias-Wang1996]. A structure theorem for bounded tiles in [formula] is obtained by Lagarias and Wang in [\cite=Lagarias-WangInvent] where it is proved that all tilings of [formula] by a bounded region (compact set with zero boundary measure) must be periodic, and that the corresponding tiling complements are rational up to affine transformations.

As we shall see, the situation the field of p-adic numbers is relatively simple.

Let [formula] be the field of p-adic numbers and let [formula] be the Haar measure of [formula] such that [formula] where [formula] is the ring of p-adic integers. A Borel set [formula] is said to be almost compact open if there exists a compact open set [formula] such that [formula]. In this note, we prove the following theorem.

Assume that [formula] is a bounded Borel set of positive and finite Haar measure. If Ω tiles [formula] by translation, then it is an almost compact open set.

Compact open tiles in [formula] are characterized in [\cite=FFS] by the p-homogeneity which is easy to check. Actually, it is proved in [\cite=FFLS2015] that tiles in [formula] are always compact open without the boundedness assumption. But the proof in [\cite=FFLS2015] was based on the theory of Bruhat-Schwartz distributions and on the theory of the Colombeau algebra of generalized functions. The proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm] given in this note is more direct and easier to understand.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm]

The proof is based on Fourier analysis. We first recall some notation and some useful facts on Fourier analysis and on the pn-th roots of unity.

Recall of notation

We denote by |  ·  |p the absolute value on [formula]. A typical element of [formula] is expanded as a convergent series

[formula]

where v is the valution of x, which satisfies |x|p = p- v. We wirte [formula], which is called the fractional part of x. A non-trivial additive character of [formula] is the following function

[formula]

which produces all characters χy of [formula] [formula], where χy(x)  =  χ(yx). Remark that each χy(  ·  ) is uniformly locally constant, i.e.

[formula]

Notation: [formula]. It is the group of units of [formula].

[formula]. It is the (closed) ball centered at 0 of radius pn.

B(x,pn):  =  x  +  B(0,pn).

1A: the indicator function of a set A.

[formula] It is a complete set of representatives of the cosets of the additive subgroup [formula].

Fourier transformation

Let μ be a finite Borel measure on [formula]. The Fourier transform of μ is classically defined to be

[formula]

The Fourier transform [formula] of [formula] is that of μf where μf is the measure defined by [formula].

The following lemma shows that the Fourier transform of the indicator function of a ball centered at 0 is a function of the same type.

Let [formula] be an integer. We have

[formula]

The following lemma shows that the Fourier transform of a compactly supported integrable function is uniformly locally constant.

Let [formula] be a complex-value integrable function. If f is supported by B(0,pγ), then

[formula]

It suffices to observe that

[formula]

and that u∈B(0,p-  γ) implies |uy|p  ≤  1 for all y∈B(0,pγ), so that χ(uy) - 1 = 0, by ([\ref=chi]).

[formula]-module generated by pn-th roots of unity

Let ωγ  =  e2πi / pγ, which is a primitive pγ-th root of unity.

Let [formula]. Suppose

[formula]

Then for any integer 0  ≤  i  ≤  pγ - 1 - 1, we have ai = ai + jpγ - 1 for all [formula].

Lemma [\ref=root] immediately leads to the following consequence.

Let [formula] be a set of p points and let [formula], , where δs is the dirac measure concentrated at the point s. Then (ξ) = 0 if and only if [formula] for all distinct [formula].

It suffices to notice that [formula]

For a finite set [formula], let

[formula]

Let T  ⊂  Zp be a finite set. We have (ξ)  ≠  0 for all [formula].

We give a proof by contradiction. Suppose that (ξ) = 0 for some [formula] with |ξ|p > pγT + 1. Then from (ξ) = 0 and Lemma [\ref=root], we deduce that the cardinality of T is a multiple of p and T is partitioned into Card(T) / p subsets [formula] such that each Ti contains p elements and (ξ) = 0. By Lemma [\ref=Cor-Sch] applied to S = T0, we get [formula] for distinct [formula]. However, by the definition of γT and the fact |ξ|p > pγT + 1, we have

[formula]

which contradicts [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm]

It is clear that the translation and the dilation don't change the tiling property of a tile in [formula]. Then, without loss of generality, we assume that [formula]. Observe that for any [formula], either [formula] or [formula]. Also observe that [formula] is a tile of [formula] with tiling complement [formula] (see Section [\ref=definition] for the definition of [formula]). These observations imply that Ω is a tile of [formula] if and only if it is a tile of [formula]. Now assume that Ω is a tile of [formula] with tiling complement T. Since [formula] and [formula], the tiling complement T is a finite subset of [formula]. Let [formula]. By definition, (Ω,T) is a tiling pair in [formula] iff the following convolution equality holds

[formula]

Taking Fourier transform of both sides of the equality, by Lemma [\ref=FourierIntegral], we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=nonzero], we deduce from ([\ref=zero]) that

[formula]

Then, by using Lemma [\ref=localconstant], we get

[formula]

that is to say, the continuous function [formula] is constant on each ball of radius p- (γT + 1). Therefore, the support of [formula] is a union of disjoint balls of radius p- (γT + 1). That is the same for Ω but up to a set of zero measure because [formula] Then, using the fact that [formula], we conclude that the support of Ω is equal almost everywhere to a finite number of disjoint balls of radius p- (γT + 1).
