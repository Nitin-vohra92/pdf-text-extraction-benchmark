Quasi-minimal Lorentz Surfaces with Pointwise 1-type Gauss Map in Pseudo-Euclidean 4-Space

Introduction

In the present paper we study Lorentz surfaces in pseudo-Euclidean space [formula]. A surface is called minimal if its mean curvature vector vanishes identically. Minimal surfaces are important in differential geometry as well as in physics. Minimal Lorentz surfaces in [formula] have been classified recently by B.-Y. Chen [\cite=Chen-TaJM]. Several classification results for minimal Lorentz surfaces in indefinite space forms are obtained in [\cite=Chen3]. In particular, a complete classification of all minimal Lorentz surfaces in a pseudo-Euclidean space [formula] with arbitrary dimension m and arbitrary index s is given.

A natural extension of minimal surfaces are quasi-minimal surfaces. A surface in a pseudo-Riemannian manifold is called quasi-minimal (also pseudo-minimal or marginally trapped) if its mean curvature vector is lightlike at each point of the surface [\cite=Rosca]. Quasi-minimal surfaces in pseudo-Euclidean space have been very actively studied in the last few years. In [\cite=Chen-JMAA] B.-Y. Chen classified quasi-minimal Lorentz flat surfaces in [formula] and gave a complete classification of biharmonic Lorentz surfaces in [formula] with lightlike mean curvature vector. Several other families of quasi-minimal surfaces have also been classified. For example, quasi-minimal surfaces with constant Gauss curvature in [formula] were classified in [\cite=Chen-HMJ] [\cite=Chen-Yang]. Quasi-minimal Lagrangian surfaces and quasi-minimal slant surfaces in complex space forms were classified, respectively, in [\cite=Chen-Dillen] and [\cite=Chen-Mihai]. The classification of quasi-minimal surfaces with parallel mean curvature vector in [formula] is obtained in [\cite=Chen-Garay]. In [\cite=GM5] the classification of quasi-minimal rotational surfaces of elliptic, hyperbolic or parabolic type is given. For an up-to-date survey on quasi-minimal surfaces, see also [\cite=Chen-TJM].

Another basic class of surfaces in Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian geometry are the surfaces with parallel mean curvature vector field, since they are critical points of some natural functionals and play important role in differential geometry, the theory of harmonic maps, as well as in physics. Surfaces with parallel mean curvature vector field in Riemannian space forms were classified in the early 1970s by Chen [\cite=Chen1] and Yau [\cite=Yau]. Recently, spacelike surfaces with parallel mean curvature vector field in arbitrary indefinite space forms were classified in [\cite=Chen1-2] and [\cite=Chen1-3]. A complete classification of Lorentz surfaces with parallel mean curvature vector field in arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean space [formula] is given in [\cite=Chen-KJM] [\cite=Fu-Hou] [\cite=HouYang2010]. A survey on classical and recent results concerning submanifolds with parallel mean curvature vector in Riemannian manifolds as well as in pseudo-Riemannian manifolds is presented in [\cite=Chen-survey].

The study of submanifolds of Euclidean or pseudo-Euclidean space via the notion of finite type immersions began in the late 1970's with the papers [\cite=Ch1] [\cite=Ch2] of B.-Y. Chen. An isometric immersion x:M →   [formula] of a submanifold M in Euclidean m-space [formula] (or pseudo-Euclidean space [formula]) is said to be of finite type [\cite=Ch1], if x identified with the position vector field of M in [formula] (or [formula]) can be expressed as a finite sum of eigenvectors of the Laplacian Δ of M, i.e. where x0 is a constant map, x1,x2,...,xk are non-constant maps such that Δxi  =  λixi, [formula], 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. More precisely, if λ1,λ2,...,λk are different, then M is said to be of k-type. Many results on finite type immersions have been collected in the survey paper [\cite=Ch3]. The newest results on submanifolds of finite type are collected in [\cite=Chen-book].

The notion of finite type immersion is naturally extended to the Gauss map G on M by B.-Y. Chen and P. Piccinni in [\cite=CP], where they introduced the problem "To what extent does the type of the Gauss map of a submanifold of [formula] determine the submanifold?". A submanifold M of an Euclidean (or pseudo-Euclidean) space is said to have 1-type Gauss map G, if G satisfies ΔG = a(G + C) for some [formula] and some constant vector C.

A submanifold M is said to have pointwise 1-type Gauss map if its Gauss map G satisfies

[formula]

for some non-zero smooth function φ on M and some constant vector C [\cite=CCK]. A pointwise 1-type Gauss map is called proper if the function φ is non-constant. A submanifold with pointwise 1-type Gauss map is said to be of first kind if the vector C is zero. Otherwise, it is said to be of second kind.

Classification results on surfaces with pointwise 1-type Gauss map in Minkowski space have been obtained in the last few years. For example, in [\cite=KY3] Y. Kim and D. Yoon studied ruled surfaces with 1-type Gauss map in Minkowski space [formula] and gave a complete classification of null scrolls with 1-type Gauss map. The classification of ruled surfaces with pointwise 1-type Gauss map of first kind in Minkowski space [formula] is given in [\cite=KY2]. Ruled surfaces with pointwise 1-type Gauss map of second kind in Minkowski 3-space were classified in [\cite=CKY].

The complete classification of flat rotation surfaces with pointwise 1-type Gauss map in the 4-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean space [formula] is given in [\cite=KY2-a]. A classification of flat Moore type rotational surfaces in terms of the type of their Gauss map is obtained in [\cite=Aksoyak15]. Recently, Arslan and the first author have obtained a classification of meridian surfaces with pointwise 1-type Gauss map [\cite=Arslanetall2014]. The classification of marginally trapped surfaces with pointwise 1-type Gauss map in Minkowski 4-space is given in [\cite=Mil] and [\cite=Turg].

In the present paper we study quasi-minimal Lorentz surfaces in [formula] with pointwise 1-type Gauss map. First we describe the quasi-minimal surfaces with harmonic Gauss map proving that each such surface is a flat surface with parallel mean curvature vector field. Next we give explicitly all flat quasi-minimal surfaces with pointwise 1-type Gauss map (Theorem [\ref=PropFlatQuasi]). Further, we obtain that a non-flat quasi-minimal surface with flat normal connection has pointwise 1-type Gauss map if and only if it has parallel mean curvature vector field (Theorem [\ref=THMNonFlat]). We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a quasi-minimal surface with non-flat normal connection to have pointwise 1-type Gauss map. In Theorem [\ref=THMNONFLATNORMALMainTheo] we present the complete classification of quasi-minimal surface with non-flat normal connection and pointwise 1-type Gauss map. At the end of the paper we give an explicit example of a quasi-minimal surface with non-flat normal connection and pointwise 1-type Gauss map. This is also an example of a quasi-minimal surface with non-parallel mean curvature vector field.

Preliminaries

Let [formula] be the pseudo-Euclidean m-space endowed with the canonical pseudo-Euclidean metric of index s given by

[formula]

where [formula] are rectangular coordinates of the points of [formula]. As usual, we denote by 〈  ,〉 the indefinite inner scalar product with respect to g0.

A non-zero vector v is said to be spacelike (respectively, timelike) if 〈v,v〉  >  0 (respectively, 〈v,v〉  <  0). A vector v is called lightlike if it is nonzero and satisfies 〈v,v〉  =  0.

We use the following denotations:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula] and [formula] (m  ≥  3) are complete pseudo-Riemannian manifolds with constant sectional curvatures 1 and - 1, respectively. The pseudo-Euclidean space [formula] is known as the Minkowski m-space, the space [formula] is known as the de Sitter space, and the space [formula] is the hyperbolic space (or the anti-de Sitter space) [\cite=O'N].

The Gauss map G of a submanifold Mn of [formula] is defined as follows. Let G(n,m) be the Grassmannian manifold consisting of all oriented n-planes through the origin of [formula] and [formula] be the vector space obtained by the exterior product of n vectors in [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula] be two vectors of [formula]. The indefinite inner product on the Grassmannian manifold is defined by

[formula]

Thus, in a natural way, we can identify [formula] with some pseudo-Euclidean space [formula], where [formula], and k is a positive integer. Let [formula] be a local orthonormal frame field in [formula] such that [formula] en are tangent to Mn and [formula] are normal to Mn. The map G:Mn  →  G(n,m) defined by [formula] en)(p) is called the Gauss map of Mn. It is a smooth map which carries a point p of Mn into the oriented n-plane in [formula] obtained by the parallel translation of the tangent space of Mn at p in [formula] [\cite=KY2-a]. See also [\cite=Turg] for detailed information about definition and geometrical interpretation of the Gauss map of submanifolds.

For any real valued function φ on Mn the Laplacian Δφ of φ is given by the formula

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] is the Levi-Civita connection of [formula] and [formula] is the induced connection on Mn.

In the present paper we consider the pseudo-Euclidean 4-dimensional space [formula] with the canonical pseudo-Euclidean metric of index 2. In this case, the metric g0 becomes g0  =  dx21  +  dx22  -  dx23  -  dx24. A surface M21 in [formula] is called Lorentz if the induced metric g on M21 is Lorentzian. So, at each point p∈M21 we have the following decomposition

[formula]

with the property that the restriction of the metric onto the tangent space TpM21 is of signature (1,1), and the restriction of the metric onto the normal space NpM21 is of signature (1,1).

We denote by [formula] and [formula] the Levi Civita connections of M21 and [formula], respectively. For vector fields X, Y tangent to M21 and a vector field ξ normal to M21, the formulas of Gauss and Weingarten, giving a decomposition of the vector fields [formula] and [formula] into tangent and normal components, are given respectively by [\cite=Chen1]:

[formula]

These formulas define the second fundamental form h, the normal connection D, and the shape operator Aξ with respect to ξ. For each normal vector field ξ, the shape operator Aξ is a symmetric endomorphism of the tangent space TpM21 at p∈M21. In general, Aξ is not diagonalizable. It is well known that the shape operator and the second fundamental form are related by the formula

[formula]

for X, Y tangent to M21 and ξ normal to M21.

The mean curvature vector field H of M21 in [formula] is defined as [formula]. The surface M21 is called minimal if its mean curvature vector vanishes identically, i.e. H = 0. The surface M21 is called quasi-minimal if its mean curvature vector is lightlike at each point, i.e. H  ≠  0 and 〈H,H〉 = 0. Obviously, quasi-minimal surfaces are always non-minimal.

A normal vector field ξ on M21 is called parallel in the normal bundle (or simply parallel) if Dξ = 0 holds identically [\cite=Chen2]. The surface M21 is said to have parallel mean curvature vector field if its mean curvature vector H satisfies DH = 0 identically.

Classification of quasi-minimal surfaces with pointwise 1-type Gauss map

In this section we study quasi-minimal surfaces in pseudo-Euclidean space [formula]. We obtain complete classification of quasi-minimal surfaces with pointwise 1-type Gauss map.

Moving frame on a quasi-minimal surface

Let M21 be a Lorentz surface in [formula]. Then, locally there exists a coordinate system (u,v) on M21 such that the metric tensor is given by

[formula]

for some positive function f(u,v) [\cite=Chen2]. Thus, putting [formula] and [formula], we obtain a pseudo-orthonormal frame field {x,y} of the tangent bundle of M21 such that 〈x,x〉  =  0, 〈y,y〉  =  0, 〈x,y〉  =   - 1. Then the mean curvature vector field H is given by

[formula]

Now, let M21 be quasi-minimal, i.e. its mean curvature vector is lightlike at each point. Then there exists a pseudo-orthonormal frame field {n1,n2} of the normal bundle such that n1  =   - H, 〈n1,n1〉  =  0, 〈n2,n2〉  =  0, 〈n1,n2〉  =   - 1.

By a direct computation we obtain the following derivative formulas: for some smooth functions a,b,c,d, β1, and β2, where [formula] and [formula] Thus, the Gaussian curvature K and the normal curvature κ of M21 are

[formula]

where R and RD are the curvature tensors associated with the connections [formula] and D, respectively.

If M21 is a quasi-minimal surface with parallel mean curvature vector field, then M21 has flat normal connection.

It follows from [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnection1c] that DxH = β1H, DyH = β2H. Hence, the mean curvature vector field H is parallel if and only if β1  =  β2  =  0. Now, under the assumption β1  =  β2  =  0, equality [\eqref=kappaeq] implies κ  =  0. Therefore, if H is parallel then the surface has flat normal connection.

Using the equations of Gauss and Codazzi, from formulas [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnection1ALL] we obtain the following integrability conditions:

Equalities [\eqref=IntEq1] and [\eqref=IntEq6] imply that the Gauss curvature K and the normal curvature κ are expressed as follows:

[formula]

If b = d = 0, then [\eqref=GaussianEQ-a] implies K = 0, i.e. M21 is flat. In [\cite=Chen-JMAA], B.-Y. Chen obtained complete classification of flat quasi-minimal surfaces in [formula]. Considering the proof of this theorem, one can see that a quasi-minimal surface in [formula] satisfying b = d = 0 is congruent to a surface parametrized by

[formula]

for a smooth function θ.

Let M21 be a quasi-minimal surface in [formula] with parallel mean curvature vector field. If M21 has constant Gauss curvature, then M21 is flat.

Let M21 be a quasi-minimal surface with parallel mean curvature vector field and constant Gaussian curvature K0. Assume that K0  ≠  0. Since M21 has parallel mean curvature vector, according to Lemma [\ref=Lemma-parallel_H] it has flat normal connection. Therefore, because of [\eqref=kappaeq-a], we have ad  =  bc and hence the Gauss curvature is K0  =  2ad. Since K0  ≠  0 we have that a,b,c,d do not vanish and satisfy

[formula]

for a smooth function α(u,v). Note that α does not vanish and αcd = .

In addition, since M21 has parallel mean curvature vector field, we have β1  =  β2 = 0. Therefore, equalities [\eqref=IntEq2], [\eqref=IntEq4], [\eqref=IntEq5] take the form Equalities [\eqref=IntEq4a], [\eqref=IntEq5a] together with [\eqref=LemmaConstGaussEq2] imply that

[formula]

Applying x to the first equality of [\eqref=LemmaConstGaussEq2] and using [\eqref=IntEq4a] and [\eqref=LemmaConstGaussEq3] we obtain x(a) = 2aγ1. Having in mind that [formula], we get which implies a(u,v) = φ(v)f2(u,v) for a smooth function φ(v). Now using [\eqref=IntEq2a] we get [formula]. Since φ is a function of v, we obtain [formula]. Solving this equation, we get f(u,v) = f1(u)f2(v) for some smooth functions f1(u), f2(v). On the other hand, the Gauss curvature is expressed by the function f(u,v) according to the formula [formula]. Hence, K0 = 0, which contradicts the assumption K0  ≠  0.

Gauss map of quasi-minimal surfaces

Let M21 be a quasi-minimal surface in [formula]. The Gauss map of M21 is defined by We shall use the frame field {x,y,n1,n2} defined in the previous subsection. This frame field generates the following frame of the Grassmanian manifold:

[formula]

for which we have

[formula]

and all other scalar products are equal to zero.

Since 〈x,x〉  =  〈y,y〉  =  0,〈x,y〉  =   - 1, the Laplace operator Δ:C∞(M21)  →  C∞(M21) of M21 takes the form

[formula]

for any real valued function φ.

Hence, the Laplacian of the Gauss map is given by the formula By a direct computation, using [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnection1ALL], [\eqref=IntEqAll], [\eqref=GaussianEQ-a], and [\eqref=kappaeq-a], we obtain

[formula]

The next proposition follows directly from formula [\eqref=E42MargTrapGMLap].

Let M21 be a quasi-minimal surface in the pseudo-Euclidean space [formula]. Then, M21 has harmonic Gauss map if and only if M21 is a flat surface with parallel mean curvature vector field.

See [\cite=HouYang2010] for the classification of Lorentzian surfaces with parallel mean curvature vector in [formula].

Further we shall study quasi-minimal surfaces with pointwise 1-type Gauss map, i.e. the Laplacian of G satisfies [\eqref=PW1typeEq1] for a smooth non-vanishing function φ and a constant vector C.

Having in mind Lemma [\ref=Lemma-parallel_H] and Lemma [\ref=LemmaConstGauss], from [\eqref=E42MargTrapGMLap] we have the following proposition.

Let M21 be a quasi-minimal surface in the pseudo-Euclidean space [formula]. If M21 is a non-flat surface with parallel mean curvature vector field, then it has proper pointwise 1-type Gauss map of first kind. In this case, [\eqref=PW1typeEq1] is satisfied for the smooth function φ =  - 2K.

Now, we shall give the complete classification of quasi-minimal surfaces with pointwise 1-type Gauss map.

Assume that M21 has pointwise 1-type Gauss map. Then from [\eqref=PW1typeEq1] and [\eqref=E42MargTrapGMLap] we get the equality

[formula]

which implies

Flat quasi-minimal surfaces with pointwise 1-type Gauss map

In this subsection we give the classification of flat quasi-minimal surfaces in [formula] with pointwise 1-type Gauss map.

Let M21 be a flat quasi-minimal surface with pointwise 1-type Gauss map, i.e., [\eqref=PW1typeEq1] is satisfied for a non-zero function φ and a constant vector C. Applying x and y to [\eqref=PW1TypeEq1a] and using K  =  0, we obtain β2b  =  β1d  =  0.

Note that if M21 has parallel mean curvature vector, then according to Proposition [\ref=THMGMHarmonic] the Gauss map is harmonic. Since we consider the non-harmonic case, we have [formula]. Hence, b  d = 0, i.e. at least one of the functions b or d is zero. If we assume that b  =  0,d  ≠  0, then we get κ = 0,β1  =  0,β2  =  0. Applying y to [\eqref=PW1TypeEq1e] we obtain - 1  =  0, which is a contradiction. Similarly for the case d  =  0,b  ≠  0. Hence, the only possible case is b  =  d = 0. Thus, according to Remark 3.2 M21 is congruent to the surface given by [\eqref=PropSpecSurfPosVec] for some function θ(u,v). Now, using the condition that the surface has pointwise 1-type Gauss map we will obtain conditions on θ(u,v).

We put [formula], [formula] and [formula].

Let M21 be a flat quasi-minimal surface in the pseudo-Euclidean space [formula]. Then, M21 has pointwise 1-type Gauss map if and only if it is congruent to the surface given by [\eqref=PropSpecSurfPosVec] for a smooth function θ satisfying

[formula]

where F is a non-constant function, c1 and c2 are constants. In this case, [\eqref=PW1typeEq1] is satisfied for the smooth function

[formula]

and the non-zero constant vector

[formula]

By a direct computation from [\eqref=PropSpecSurfPosVec] we get

[formula]

which imply

[formula]

and

[formula]

where we put [formula]

From [\eqref=PW1typeEq1], [\eqref=PropSpecSurfG] and [\eqref=PropSpecSurfDG] we obtain

[formula]

Since the right hand side of this equation is a constant vector, the vector field

[formula]

is also constant. So, we obtain that the system of equations

[formula]

is satisfied for some constants c1 and c2. The last two equations imply

[formula]

From this equation, one can see that the function ζ remains constant along the curve ψ = c, where ψ is the function given by the second equality in [\eqref=PropSpecSurfSufNecEq]. Hence, we have proved that θ satisfies the first equality in [\eqref=PropSpecSurfSufNecEq].

Conversely, by a straightforward computation one can see that [\eqref=PW1typeEq1] is satisfied for the constant vector C and the smooth non-zero function F given by [\eqref=PropSpecSurfFuncPHI] and [\eqref=PropSpecSurfC].

Quasi-minimal surfaces with flat normal connection

In this subsection, we focus on quasi-minimal surfaces with κ = 0.

Let M21 be a quasi-minimal surface with flat normal connection and pointwise 1-type Gauss map. Then, [\eqref=PW1TypeEq1b] implies [formula]. Applying x and y to the last equation and using [\eqref=PW1TypeEq1e] and [\eqref=PW1TypeEq1f] we obtain On the other hand, from [\eqref=GaussianEQ-a] and [\eqref=kappaeq-a] we have K = 2bc. If the Gauss curvature does not vanish, then β1  =  β2  =  0 and hence M21 has parallel mean curvature vector field. Combining this with Proposition [\ref=THMNonFlat1type], we get the following result.

Let M21 be a quasi-minimal surface in the pseudo-Euclidean space [formula] with flat normal connection and non-vanishing Gauss curvature. Then, M21 has pointwise 1-type Gauss map if and only if it has parallel mean curvature vector field. In this case, M21 has proper pointwise 1-type Gauss map of first kind.

We would like to note that a classification of Lorentz surfaces with parallel mean curvature vector field in the pseudo-Euclidean space [formula] is given in [\cite=HouYang2010]. Considering this theorem and its proof, one can see that there exist two families of quasi-minimal surfaces with proper pointwise 1-type Gauss map of first kind:

A non-flat CMC-surface lying in [formula] for some r > 0 such that the mean curvature vector H' of M in [formula] satisfies 〈H',H'〉 =  - r2;

A non-flat CMC-surface lying in [formula] for some r > 0 such that the mean curvature vector H' of M in [formula] satisfies 〈H',H'〉 = r2.

Conversely, any quasi-minimal surface with proper pointwise 1-type Gauss map of first kind belongs to one of the above two families.

Quasi-minimal surfaces with non-flat normal connection

In this subsection we focus on quasi-minimal surfaces with non-flat normal connection and pointwise 1-type Gauss map. Before we proceed, we would like to note that recent results show that there are no such surfaces if the ambient space is [formula] or [formula] (see [\cite=Mil] [\cite=Turg] [\cite=Turg2]).

First we prove the following proposition.

Let M21 be a quasi-minimal surface in [formula] with non-vanishing normal curvature. Then, M21 has pointwise 1-type Gauss map if and only if there exists a local coordinate system (s,t) such that x̄  =  ∂s, [formula], n1 and n2 form a pseudo-orthonormal frame field of the tangent bundle of M21 and the Levi-Civita connection satisfies where [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] are smooth functions given by for some non-vanishing smooth functions λ1,λ3 and a smooth function λ2.

In this case, M21 has Gauss curvature

[formula]

Moreover, [\eqref=PW1typeEq1] is satisfied for

[formula]

Assume that the normal curvature κ is non-vanishing and M21 has pointwise 1-type Gauss map. Then, [\eqref=PW1typeEq1] is satisfied for a constant vector C and a smooth non-vanishing function φ such that formulas [\eqref=PW1TypeEq1ALL] hold true. Applying x to [\eqref=PW1TypeEq1c] and y to [\eqref=PW1TypeEq1d], we obtain Note that if b2 + d2 = 0 at a point p, then [\eqref=kappaeq-a] implies κ(p) = 0 which contradicts the assumption that κ is non-vanishing. If both b and d are non-zero, then [formula] and from [\eqref=PW1TypeEq1b] we get κ  =  0, a contradiction. Hence, b  =  0,d  ≠  0 or b  ≠  0,d  =  0. Therefore, replacing x and y if necessary, we may assume that d  ≠  0 and b = 0. Thus, [\eqref=PW1TypeEq2b] gives [formula] and equations [\eqref=GaussianEQ-a], [\eqref=kappaeq-a] imply K = κ  =  ad. Therefore, [\eqref=PW1TypeEq1a] and [\eqref=PW1TypeEq1b] imply

[formula]

On the other hand, from [formula] we obtain [formula] which gives β1 = 0 because of [\eqref=PW1TypeEq1e]. Therefore, combining [\eqref=PW1TypeEq1ALL] and [\eqref=TheoremnonflatEq1], we obtain

[formula]

Next, we define a local coordinate system (s,t) in the following way:

[formula]

Note that we have where [formula], which give

[formula]

Thus, the metric tensor of M21 with respect to the new coordinate system (s,t) takes the form It is easy to calculate that Moreover, [formula] and [formula]. Hence, {x̄,} form a pseudo-orthonormal frame field of the tangent bundle of M21. Using [\eqref=QMinimalS421LeviCivita1ALL] and taking into account that b = β1 = 0, we get that the Levi-Civita connection of M21 satisfies [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflat1ALL] for the functions [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Now, equality [\eqref=TheoremnonflatEQUfCPre] gives the second equality in [\eqref=TheoremnonflatEQUfC].

With respect to the new coordinate system (s,t) the integrability conditions [\eqref=IntEqAll] become Since d  ≠  0, from [\eqref=NewIntEq5] we get the second equality in [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1ad] for a non-vanishing smooth function λ3  =  λ3(t). Furthermore, combining [\eqref=NewIntEq4], [\eqref=NewIntEq6], and [\eqref=NewIntEq1], we get

[formula]

and

[formula]

for some smooth functions λ4  =  λ4(t) and λ5  =  λ5(t) .

Next, using [\eqref=QMinimalS421LeviCivita1ALL] we obtain Since C is a constant vector, we have [formula] and [formula]. So, we get the following two equations: From [\eqref=NewCoordPW1Cond1a] using [\eqref=NewIntEq6] we get [formula]. Differentiating the last equality with respect to s, we obtain the equation

[formula]

whose solution is given by

[formula]

for some smooth functions λ1  =  λ1(t)  ≠  0 and λ2  =  λ2(t). The function [formula] is expressed as [formula], which implies [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1beta]. Combining [\eqref=NewCoordPW1Cond1Gaussian] and [\eqref=NewIntEq1] with the second equality in [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1ad], we obtain that [formula] is expressed as given by the first equality in [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1ad].

Furthermore, from [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1beta] and [\eqref=NewIntEqAraEq1] we get

[formula]

for a smooth function λ6  =  λ6(t).

Next, using [\eqref=NewCoordPW1Cond1b] and taking into consideration [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1beta], [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1c], [\eqref=NewIntEqAraEq1] and [\eqref=NewCoordPW1Cond1Gaussian], we get that the function λ5(t) is expressed as follows:

[formula]

Further, using [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1ad], [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1beta], [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1f], and [\eqref=NewIntEq2], we obtain

[formula]

which implies the following expressions for the functions λ4(t) and λ6(t):

[formula]

Now, from [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1c], [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1f], [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariantsCond1c], and [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariantsCond1b] we obtain [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1cFinal]. Finally, taking into consideration [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1f], [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariantsCond1b], and [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariantsCond1d] we obtain that the function [formula] is expressed as given in [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1fFinal]. Hence, the proof of the necessary condition is completed.

In order to prove the sufficient condition we assume that there exists a coordinate system (s,t) such that [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflat1ALL] and [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1ALL] are satisfied. By a straightforward computation using [\eqref=E42MargTrapGMLap] one can check that G satisfies [\eqref=PW1typeEq1] for the non-constant function [formula] and vector [formula]. A further calculation yields that C is a non-zero constant vector. Hence, M21 has proper pointwise 1-type Gauss map of second kind.

Let M21 be a quasi-minimal surface with non-flat normal connection in the pseudo-Euclidean space [formula]. If the Gauss map of M21 satisfies [\eqref=PW1typeEq1], then M21 has proper pointwise 1-type Gauss map of second kind.

In the following theorem, we obtain a parametrization for the surface described in Proposition [\ref=THMNONFLATNORMAL]. This completes the classification of quasi-minimal surfaces in [formula] with non-flat normal connection and pointwise 1-type Gauss map.

Let M21 be a quasi-minimal surface in [formula] with non-vanishing normal curvature. Then, M21 has pointwise 1-type Gauss map if and only if it is congruent to the surface given by

[formula]

for some smooth functions λ1  =  λ1(t), λ3  =  λ3(t) and some [formula]-valued smooth functions n1(t), ξ(t) satisfying the equations

[formula]

and

[formula]

where ζ  =  ζ(t) is the [formula]-valued function given by

[formula]

Let M21 be the surface described in Proposition [\ref=THMNONFLATNORMAL] for some smooth functions λ1(t) and λ3(t). Then, the first equation in [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflat1c] implies n1 = n1(t). Thus, the first equation in [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflat1a] and [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1ad] give the differential equation

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

for some [formula]-valued smooth function ξ1(t). Hence, the position vector z(s,t) is given by

[formula]

where ξ(t) is a [formula]-valued smooth function. Without loss of generality, we may assume that λ2 = 0 by re-defining s.

Now, using [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflat1c], [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1ad] and [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1beta] we obtain ξ1(t)  =    -  λ3n1'(t). Combining the last equality with [\eqref=MainTheoEqu1] we get that M21 is congruent to the surface parametrized by [\eqref=PW1TYPEPAra].

Now, from the first equation in [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflat1b] we have

[formula]

The last equation together with [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1f] and [\eqref=PW1TYPEPAra] imply [\eqref=PW1TYPEEqu1]. Note that, since x̄ = zs and [formula] form a pseudo-orthonormal frame field of the tangent bundle of M21, [\eqref=PW1TYPEPAra] and [\eqref=PW1TYPEEqu1] imply [\eqref=MainTheLastEqs].

On the other hand, from the second equality in [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflat1b] we have

[formula]

Using [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1ALL], [\eqref=PW1TYPEEqu1] and λ2 = 0, we compute the right-hand side of this equality and obtain

[formula]

The last equality together with the second equality in [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflat1d] and [\eqref=PW1TYPEEqu1] imply

[formula]

Denoting by ζ the vector field given in [\eqref=PW1TYPEEqu2b] we obtain [\eqref=PW1TYPEEqu2]. Hence, the proof of the necessary condition is completed.

The converse follows by a direct computation.

Below we present an explicit example of a quasi-minimal surface with non-flat normal connection and pointwise 1-type Gauss map.

Let M be the surface given by

[formula]

in the pseudo-Euclidean space [formula]. Calculating the tangent vector fields zs and zt we get 〈zs,zs〉  =  0, 〈zs,zt〉  =   - 1, 〈zt,zt〉  =   - 8s1 / 2. Hence, M is a Lorentz surface in [formula].

We consider the following normal vector field n1  =  ( cos t, sin t, sin t, cos t). Note that 〈n1,n1〉  =  0. Hence, there exists a normal vector field n2 such that 〈n2,n2〉  =  0 and 〈n1,n2〉  =   - 1. Now, we consider the following pseudo-orthonormal tangent frame field

[formula]

By a straightforward computation one can see that the mean curvature vector field is H =  - n1. Hence, M is a quasi-minimal surface. Direct computations show that

[formula]

which imply [formula], [formula]. So, M is a surface with non-parallel mean curvature vector field. The Gauss curvature K and the normal curvature κ are given by the expressions:

[formula]

Hence, M is a quasi-minimal surface with non-flat normal connection. By a straightforward computation we obtain that [\eqref=PW1typeEq1] is satisfied for the function φ  =   - 4s- 3 / 2 and the constant vector [formula]. So, M is of proper pointwise 1-type Gauss map of second type.

Note that the Levi-Civita connection of M satisfies [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflat1ALL] for the functions [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], which can be obtained by putting [formula], λ2 = 0, λ3 = 1 in [\eqref=LeviCivitaConnectionnonflatInvariants1ALL].

We would like to note that in the Minkowski space [formula] all marginally trapped surfaces with pointwise 1-type Gauss map have flat normal connection, while in the pseudo-Euclidean space [formula] there exist quasi-minimal surfaces with non-flat normal connection and pointwise 1-type Gauss map.

As far as we know, all examples of quasi-minimal surfaces in [formula] known till now in the literature are surfaces with parallel mean curvature vector field. Here we give an explicit example of a quasi-minimal surface with non-parallel mean curvature vector field.
