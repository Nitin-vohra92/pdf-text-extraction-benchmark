Tiling strategies for optical follow-up of gravitational wave triggers by wide field of view telescopes

Introduction

The upgrade of the LIGO [\citep=0264-9381-32-7-074001] and Virgo [\citep=0264-9381-32-2-024001] gravitational wave detectors will increase their sensitivity by about a factor of ten, yielding a thousand-fold increase in the search volume accessible. As a consequence, not only are we on the verge of making the first direct detection of gravitational waves (GW), but also, we are to have rates in a regime that will enable us to conduct gravitational wave astronomy. In particular, the estimated rates of double neutron star binary mergers, both from theoretical estimates as well as extrapolations based on the known sample of binary radio pulsars, suggest a detection rate of several tens per year for the final advanced LIGO-Virgo network at their design sensitivity [\citep=Abadie:2010cf]. The detection rate of neutron star - black hole mergers is based solely on theoretical estimates and could well be similar in part due to a larger detection horizon at a given detector sensitivity.

The merger of a binary system consisting of neutron stars or black holes is an extremely energetic event which is also expected to provide us an electromagnetic counterpart (EM) [\citep=Eichler:1989fk] [\citep=Narayan:1992iy] [\citep=1538-4357-507-1-L59]. In case both EM as well as GW data are available the scientific yield of the detection will be significantly enhanced: The EM counterpart will for instance provide a very accurate position and possibly redshift. Additional information on the type of object may also be obtained, for example EM signals can help us distinguish between neutron star - black hole binaries with a massive neutron star from binary black hole systems. One can also expect to understand the physics of the merger better as encoded in the properties of the ejecta and an estimate of the orbital inclination can be more accurately constrained [\citep=1538-4357-487-1-L1]. The accurate position can not only be used to aid the GW data analysis, but also allows a detailed study of the environment of the merger, which in turn could provide crucial information about the pre-merger evolution of the system (circumstellar material, host galaxy information, position in/outside galaxy etc).

The most promising EM signals to accompany neutron star and black hole mergers are prompt short duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) [\citep=Eichler:1989fk] [\citep=Narayan:1992iy] [\citep=1993ApJ...417L..17K] and optical/infrared signals from the radioactive decay of small amounts [formula] of high-angular momentum neutron star material that are ejected in the merger, termed kilonovae [\citep=1538-4357-507-1-L59] [\citep=Kulkarni:2005jw] [\citep=Metzger21082010] [\citep=0004-637X-775-1-18] [\citep=Rosswog21032014]. The short gamma ray burst progenitors are widely believed to be binary neutron stars or neutron star - black hole mergers, seen face-on [\citep=Nakar:2007yr] [\citep=0004-637X-708-1-9] [\citep=Church21052011] [\citep=Berger:2010qx]. The merger produces a spinning black hole surrounded by a disk/torus of material that is rapidly accreted and in which a highly relativistic jet can be formed which produces gamma-rays. The disadvantage of sort GRBs is that the gamma-ray signal may be emitted in a narrow beam. Furthermore, there exists significant uncertainty in the knowledge of the short GRB beaming angle: [\cite=0004-637X-653-1-462] finds this to be as large as [formula], where as [\cite=0004-637X-756-2-189] constrains this angle to [formula]. Thus a direct association of a GW source and a short GRB might not be very likely, although, as pointed out by [\citet=0004-637X-767-2-124], larger than the simple geometrical chance, as face-on mergers emit stronger GW signals, and thus are over represented in a sample of GW detections.

Kilonovae are expected to be emitted more isotropically, although a slight polar dependence may be present and potentially can be used to constrain the orbital inclination [\citep=Kasen21062015] [\citep=Grossman21032014]. Current models indicate that the emission from kilonovae is weaker than supernovae. Assuming opacities on the order of the electron scattering opacity [\citet=1538-4357-507-1-L59] predicted that the light curves peak in the optical/ultraviolet and rise to peak bolometric luminosities of ~  1042 â€“1044 erg/s on a timescale of a day. Incorporating iron group elements in the opacity determination [\citep=Metzger21082010] [\citep=2041-8205-736-1-L21] the predicted light curves peak at lower bolometric luminosities ~  1041 -1042.5 erg/s on similar timescale. Assuming heavy element r-process nucleosynthesis, the opacities are orders of magnitude higher than those of iron group elements [\citep=0004-637X-775-1-18]. The peak bolometric luminosity in that case is lower ~  1040.5 -1041.5 erg/s. This corresponds to around - 13 to - 15 absolute magnitude in the i-band [\citep=0004-637X-775-2-113] [\citep=0004-637X-775-1-18] [\citep=Grossman21032014], which translates to ~  21.5  -  23.5 apparent i-band magnitude for sources at the average binary neutron-star range of ~  200 Mpc for the advanced LIGO detectors. Therefore, detecting kilonova events at distances of several hundreds of Mpc will be a challenge. However, due to their isotropic nature, one can expect to see kilonova events associated with GW triggers at closer distances than what we have observed for the short GRB triggered kilonova [\citep=kilonova] [\citep=BergerRProcess].

A third possible EM counterpart that we can detect using optical follow-up of GW triggers are the orphan afterglows that could follow short GRB events. A first possible orphan afterglow was reported by [\citet=0004-637X-769-2-130] from observations made with the Palomar Transient Factory. This event however was most likely from a long duration GRB. Short duration GRBs are rarer and their afterglows generally exhibit significantly weaker fluxes than the long duration GRB afterglows [\citep=0004-637X-734-2-96]. Hence, detection of orphan afterglows from short duration GRB is more difficult. However, one can expect such discoveries to be a genuine possibility with upcoming telescopes dedicated for electromagnetic follow-up of GW triggers. Optical afterglows are probably less isotropic than kilonovae [\citep=0004-637X-722-1-235], but they could be detectable at larger angles from the axis of the jet than the prompt gamma ray emission [\citep=0004-637X-746-1-48]. This could be an alternative route to verifying the compact binary coalescence (CBC) progenitor hypothesis of short GRBs. Given the low rates of short GRBs within the LIGO-Virgo volume [\citep=0004-637X-650-1-281], this could be a pragmatic approach.

In general there are two ways in which GW and EM data can be collected. Either there is an easily recognizable EM signal, such as a short-GRB, that can be used to conduct a targeted search in the GW data, or vice versa, a GW detection can be used to start an EM follow-up campaign to find the EM counterpart. The three main challenges of EM follow-up of GW triggers are:

Rapid detection and sky localization based on the GW data,

An operational set-up in which EM facilities with sufficiently large field of view and sensitivity can react quickly to survey the GW sky-localizations, and

An efficient selection scheme in which the (candidate) counterparts can be identified in a potential sea of false positives.

The key element in EM follow-up of gravitational wave triggers is that we are able to detect the gravitational wave events in real time. If the gravitational wave events have associated optical counterparts, then these could last for hours to days [\citep=1538-4357-507-1-L59] [\citep=Berger20111] [\citep=kilonova] [\citep=BergerRProcess]. During the first few hours to about a day we expect the optical/infrared luminosity from these sources to be at their highest. The time and sky localization of a GW candidate are known within a minute or two after the merger signal has passed the detectors [\citep=first2years] [\citep=0004-637X-804-2-114]. The GW sky-localizations will typically be as large as hundreds of square degrees [\citep=prospectsOfSkyloc] [\citep=first2years], which is many orders of magnitude poorer than what one typically expects from conventional optical telescopes. Following up such wide sky localization patches as deep as 22nd-23rd magnitude is a non-trivial task.

Once the GW sky-localization is received the task for the optical telescopes would be to observe that area with the minimum number of telescope pointings. Since a telescope pointing would cover a tile in the sky commensurate to its field of view, the observation of any desired confidence interval of the sky-localizations would require generating a set of tiles that most efficiently captures the confidence interval. This act of capturing the confidence interval with the telescope tiles will be termed coverage in this study (Sect. [\ref=Sec:skyPointing]). The strategy used for the tiling would also be the first step towards the observing strategy. In this paper we discuss and compare, for the first time, the various strategies (Sect. [\ref=Sec:skyPointing]) that one can implement for generating the sky-tiles for observing the GW sky-localizations using wide FOV telescopes. Based on the analysis conducted over the sky-localizations simulated by [\citet=first2years], we make recommendations on the optimal tiling strategy taking into account key aspects like the number of telescope pointings (Sect. [\ref=Sec:TileReduction]), issues of image subtraction (Sect. [\ref=Sec:freeGrid]) and false-positive probabilities (Sect. [\ref=Sec:FalsePositive]).

Finally, we use the optimal tiling strategy to investigate how to optimize coverage of the sky-localization regions for a given observation area (total area covered by the tiles) (Sect. [\ref=Sec:DistributedFOV]). Here we will introduce the notion of a distributed FOV array and compare its performance in covering the 2015-16 GW sky-localizations with that of traditional monolithic FOV telescopes. A distributed FOV array could simply be a group of smaller wide FOV telescopes operating in a coordinated fashion from different geographical location. For the present study we will consider all the FOVs in the array to be equal. Generalizing that to varied FOVs is not necessary to illustrate the fundamental idea.

Sky-tiling for gravitational wave localization

The rapid gravitational wave sky-localization algorithm, BAYESTAR [\citep=first2years] [\citep=Singer:2015xha], pixelates the sky using the HEALPix (Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization) projection, computes the sky localization probability distribution function (p.d.f) at every pixel and then outputs this information in FITS file format. Let us define this p.d.f as a function L(Î±,Î´), where Î± and Î´ are the sky coordinates. We define a surface S95 on the grid as the surface with the smallest possible area that contains 95% of the total localization p.d.f [\citep=PhysRevD.89.084060]

[formula]

Any wide field of view telescope observing this confidence interval of GW sky-localization can choose the minimum number of telescope FOVs (tiles) required to enclose S95. For every such area S95 there exists (at least) an area Ï„95(  â‰¥  S95) that is constructed out of the tiles needed for covering it. The tiles enclosing S95 forms a subset of the tiles that cover the full sky defining a sky-grid. Whether the area Ï„95 is unique or not would depend on whether the sky-grid is fixed or free (see discussion that follows and in Sect. [\ref=Sec:freeGrid]). If we construct a complete set {Ï„95} (which would be a singleton for fixed sky-grid), the smallest of these areas (Ï„Ì‚95) would require [formula] tiles to cover this area, where the telescope has a FOV of Î”Î±Î”Î´. The N0 tiles constituting this Ï„Ì‚95 area are the required sky-tiles that enclose the 95% confidence interval and we call them contour-covering tiles or CC-Tiles. This is the most straightforward and simple tiling strategy.

If we have the freedom to move the tiles on the grid, then there could be more than one Ï„95 for the same S95. Under such circumstances we select the one with the least number of tiles. On the other hand, if the grid is fixed on the sky, then Ï„95 is uniquely defined. Many optical surveys, including the currently active PTF [\citep=PTFRau] [\citep=PTFLaw] and Skymapper projects [\citep=2007PASA...24....1K] and the future BlackGEM and ZTF facilities [\citep=ZTF] [\citep=ZTFBellm] [\citep=ZTFSmith], use a fixed grid on the sky. This grid is predefined and covers the whole sky that is visible from the observatory's location. Although a more flexible pointing grid will in general lead to more efficient coverage, a fixed grid approach has advantages. Firstly, the search for optical transients is typically performed by subtracting a reference image taken at an earlier epoch, and looking at the residual image to find new sources. A fixed grid makes it easier to astrometrically calibrate new images relative to early reference images. Secondly, distortions caused by optical elements in the telescope and the camera vary with the position in the FOV of the telescope. Looking at the same part of the sky on roughly the same position in the FOV all the time limits the complexity of image resampling. The more complex this process, the more artifacts would be present in the residuals, which can be picked up as false-positive detections. Finally, a fixed grid simplifies the data flow, storage and access, since the images taken at a certain sky coordinate of interest can easily be retrieved based on the ID of the field that contains the coordinate.

The area S95 defined in Eq. [\ref=eq:LocContour] is unique for a given event. For an EM observer what is more important however is the Ï„95 and not the S95. Minimizing the Ï„95 will result in the most effective tiling strategy. There is an arbitrarily large number of contours (with area â‰¥  S95) that encloses the required sky-localization. For each of these contours there exists a set of tiles that encloses it and hence a Ï„95 value. It is not necessary that the Ï„95 corresponding to the S95 is the smallest. The goal is to construct the set of all contours, for any GW event, that enclose the 95% confidence interval and find the one that requires the least number (N1) of sky-tiles enclosing them. However, it is not feasible to construct contours for all possible 95% confidence intervals for a given sky-localizations. We propose an alternative way of reaching a solution, which is exact for a fixed sky-grid configuration and is an excellent approximation if there is freedom to move the grid on the sky (see Sect. [\ref=Sec:freeGrid]): If the pixel size of the BAYESTAR sky-localization is much smaller than the FOV of the telescope (which is true for wide FOV telescopes), we can approximate the GW sky-localization to a continuum. Obtaining the telescope tiles that are required to cover a given confidence interval of this continuum is essentially an exercise of finding the closest discretized approximation of the required confidence interval. Thus, instead of choosing the minimum number of tiles required to enclose the smallest confidence interval contour, we can sample the entire sky-localization map with discrete 2D-intervals equal to the FOV of the telescope and select the smallest number of these sampled intervals that constitutes 95% localization posterior probability.

Consider a telescope with a FOV of Î”Î±Î”Î´ for which we would want to construct the sky-tiles required for observation. We can construct an equal area grid on the sky with grid spacing Î”Î± and Î”Î´ along the right ascension and declination respectively to cover the entire sky with an integral number of tiles. The probability of localization at an arbitrary sample on the grid would thus be given by

[formula]

where, (i,j) are the coordinates of the sample in the sky-localization map. After ranking based on the value of the integral in Eq. [\ref=Eq:tileValue] we can select from the top of the list of these samples until we have reached â‰¥  95% probability. We call these sampled intervals of sky-localizations the ranked-tiles (RT). It is straightforward to show that this strategy is guaranteed to give us a number of tiles N1 that is less than or equal to N0, the number of tiles required for covering the smallest 95% credible area on the sky. In the next two sections we will illustrate the two tiling strategies with examples for a fixed grid. We will subsequently relax this constraint and examine the improvement in coverage (if any) upon using a free grid for both the strategies in Sect. [\ref=Sec:freeGrid].

Sky-tiling for smallest 95% credible area on the sky

To construct the 95% CC-Tiles we first generate the 95% sky-localization using BAYESTAR. In a fixed sky-grid configuration, one can simply count the tiles over which the 95% confidence region lies. For a quantitative analysis we have used as an example a telescope with a FOV of 2.7 deg2, however it should be noted that the value of the FOV is quite arbitrary and has no effect on the result. We laid the grid in such a way that every adjacent tile in the grid has a 1% area overlap with each other. This feature is required for image subtraction and calibration and will be employed by most wide FOV telescopes. BAYESTAR pixels that constitute the 95% sky-localization were labeled and the tiles in the sky-grid that contains them constitutes the 95% CC-Tiles. In Fig. [\ref=fig:3DetType1] we show an example of CC-Tiles generated for a gravitational wave source localization using the LIGO Hanford and Livingston and Virgo observatories. In this case the source is fairly well localized such that the 95% confidence interval can be covered by 42 tiles of 2.7 deg2 each. For sources that are detected in two detectors, the localization is poor, spreading over large arcs spanning across both the hemispheres. In Fig. [\ref=fig:2DetType1] we show the tiles generated for a sky-localization obtained for the two detector case (two LIGO detectors only). One would need 418 tiles to cover the 95% confidence interval for this localization.

Sky tiling based on top 95% ranked-tiles

In Sect. [\ref=Sec:skyPointing] we introduced that ranked-tile method for observation. We stated that this method allows us to account for any given confidence interval of the localization region with fewer tiles than the CC-Tiles method. Generating ranked-tiles require us to sample the sky-localization in discretized samples of the FOV of the telescope. In order to make an apples-to-apples comparison we chose the FOV of the telescope same as what we had for CC-Tiles in Sect. [\ref=Sec:type1]. Furthermore we used a sample grid identical to the sky-grid used for CC-Tiles. Computing the quantity in Eq. [\ref=Eq:tileValue] and ranking based on this value we constructed the ranked-tiles for the sky-localization. This is demonstrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:3DetComp] where we show the comparison between the two different methods of tiling. The red closed contour is the 95% confidence interval generated from BAYESTAR. The blue (solid) tiles are 95% ranked-tiles. Note that in this case the ranked-tiles are a subset of the 42 CC-Tiles for the same GW sky-localization (shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:3DetType1]) . Ranked-tiling reduces the number of tiles by 14 and, because in this case the ranked-tiles happen to be a subset of the CC-tiles, the 14 tiles we can effectively drop are the ones containing the lowest localization probabilities among the 42 CC-Tiles. We show these in dashed lines in Fig. [\ref=fig:3DetComp].

Sky tiling in the first two years LIGO - Virgo observation scenarios

An astrophysically motivated simulation of low latency detection and rapid sky localization for the first two years of LIGO and Virgo operation was presented in [\cite=first2years]. Of the order a hundred thousand binary neutron star sources with different intrinsic parameters were injected in simulated 2015 and 2016 detector noise power spectral density (PSD). Out of these Singer et al. detected around 1000 injections using the low latency detection pipeline [\citep=svdPaper]. They localized all the detected sources using BAYESTAR. For a thorough understanding of the observing scenarios during the first two years using optical telescopes we generated tiles for localizations employing both the methods discussed earlier. First, we will present the results of the comparison between the two methods. Then we will relax the fixed-grid constraint and investigate the resulting coverage from optimization.

Comparison of ranked-tile method with 95% confidence interval tiling in the first two years

To compare the performance of the two different strategies of tiling we analyzed the results of the first two years. In Fig. [\ref=fig:ReductionComparison] we show the percentage reduction in number of tiles required from using the ranked-tile strategy instead of the CC-Tiling strategy. Once again we cover the 95% localization as an example with a 2.7 deg2 FOV telescope. The tile reduction percentage is [formula], where N0, as in Sect. [\ref=Sec:skyPointing], is the number of CC-Tiles and Î”N  =  N0  -  N1. The quantity N1 is the number of ranked-tiles required to cover the same confidence interval. The positive values of the reduction for all the GW events from the first two years clearly shows that the ranked-tiling method minimizes the number of tiles required to observe a given confidence interval of GW sky-localization. We further note that the reduction is greater for smaller localizations than for larger localizations. This is further illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:3DetCompBins], where we plotted the bin-wise median percentage reduction as a function of number of tiles. This lowering of tile-reduction can be explained as follows: As we saw in the Fig. [\ref=fig:3DetComp], a part of the reduction of the tiles upon using the ranked-tile method occurs due to discarding CC-Tiles with the lowest localization probabilities. This typically occurs at the periphery of the set of CC-Tiles that is enclosing a GW sky-localization. Imagine a GW localization requiring N CC-Tiles to enclose it. The perimeter of a gravitational wave sky-localization scales as the square root of its area. Since the localization area scales as N, the number of tiles dropped scales as [formula]. Thus the reduction in the vertical axis of Fig. [\ref=fig:3DetComp] and [\ref=fig:3DetCompBins] should scale as [formula] if the dropping of the outermost tiles (dashed tiles in Fig. [\ref=fig:3DetComp]) was the sole responsible factor for tile reduction. However Fig. [\ref=fig:3DetCompBins] shows that the scaling is more gradual than that. This is due to the fact that ranked-tiles are not just a subset of the CC-Tiles, formed by dropping CC-Tiles from the periphery, a point that is illustrated further in Fig. [\ref=fig:gainDistribution95] and [\ref=fig:gainDistribution50].

From the above analysis we understand that reduction is greater when the relative tile size (relative to the size of the sky-localization) is larger than when the same is smaller. Thus for telescopes with larger FOV one can expect greater reduction than smaller FOV telescopes from using ranked-tiles for the same sky-localization. We show in Fig. [\ref=fig:gainFromRankedTiles] the median gain (of all the 2016 GW sky-localization) from using ranked-tiles for various telescopes of FOVs 1.0, 2.7, 5.4, 10.8, 21.6, 43.2 deg2.

We immediately find that the expectation that larger telescopes would experience greater reduction, is satisfied. We also note that the reduction is greater for smaller confidence intervals, for instance, one can see that the reduction from using ranked-tiles is similar for a telescope with FOV of 2.7 deg2 covering a 68% localization p.d.f and one with FOV of 10.8 deg2 covering a ~  92% localization p.d.f. Telescopes with finer tile sizes are able to transform the total observation area more efficiently to cover the required confidence contours.

It is, however, important to note that the localization probability enclosed by the CC-Tiles is larger than the same enclosed by the ranked-tiles. What we demonstrated above is that the ranked-tile method provides us a more efficient way of covering a given localization probability, with a lower number of tiles than one otherwise needs. However, it is not immediately clear from the above analysis whether the set of ranked-tiles are always (as in Fig. [\ref=fig:3DetComp]) just a subset of the CC-Tiles. Even though we note the more gradual than [formula] dropping of the tile-reduction, we would want to verify this on a event-by-event basis. To do that, we compute the localization contained in the same number of ranked-tiles as the CC-Tiles. The distribution of the percentage gain of the localization upon using the same number of tiles required to cover the contour is shown in Figs., [\ref=fig:gainDistribution95] and [\ref=fig:gainDistribution50] for 95% and 50% respectively. Note that the distribution of the gain shifts towards greater value for larger FOV telescopes. The gain is of course significantly higher for the 50% confidence interval than for the 95% confidence interval.

If the ranked-tiles were simply a subset of the CC-Tiles then we would end up with the same covered localization probability for both methods if we use the same number of ranked-tiles as the CC-Tiles. But, the non-zero gain in the distribution in Figs., [\ref=fig:gainDistribution95] and [\ref=fig:gainDistribution50] tells us that the population of tiles for the two method are not identical, matching our expectation from Fig. [\ref=fig:3DetCompBins].

Optimization in free-grid

In Sect. [\ref=Sec:firstTwoYears] we presented the results of the two strategies to cover the GW sky-localizations using telescopes FOVs when the sky-grid is a predefined set. It is expected that further minimizations of tiles can be achieved if this constraint is lifted and we are allowed to move coordinates of the tiles in the grid. The covering of the GW localizations, which are essentially irregular polygons, with the least number of square tiles is a member of a class of problems called NP-complete problems . The solution of NP-complete problems can be verified in polynomial time, however, there is no known method of locating the solutions themselves. In absence of a general recipe of finding the solution we resorted to iterative optimization, where we iteratively shifted the tiles in the grid covering the GW sky-localization to see which configuration gives us the best result. This is done in the following two steps:

Create the initial grid to cover the GW sky-localization: For every sky-localization we find the smallest size of grid that is required to cover it. The grid boundary is chosen in such a way that an integral number of tiles can be fit inside it. The right ascension (RA) and declination (Dec) values of the center of the grid lie at the mean RA and Dec value of the localization's credible region.

Optimize rows of tiles at constant declination angle: Once the initial grid is laid every rows in the grid is slid in the horizontal direction (along the right ascension angle) by steps of [formula] to look for the configuration that requires the lowest number of tiles in that particular row. Continuing the same process for all the rows we optimize the tiling.

Due to the periodic nature of the initial grid, the shifting of the rows needs to be done for one tile length. For example, if the FOV of the telescope is 2  Ã—  2 deg2, then the twenty iteration in each row is enough to locate the optimum positioning of the the tiles for a 0.1[formula] step size in a given row. We then conducted this exercise for ranked-tiling:

Once again we started from a primary sky-grid. We created a ranked list of Tij values for all the samples in this grid. This gives us the ranked-tiles for this instance of sky-grid.

Then we slide the first row of the grid in steps of [formula] up to one sample length, noted the Tij values of all the tiles and create the ranked-tiles for each of these instances of the sky-grid. Note that unlike in the case of the CC-Tiles, here there is no a priori way of optimizing each row of ranked-tiles.

Conducting this exercise for all the rows we collect the ranked-tiles for all the instances and choose the minimum of these which should be the optimal solution.

In Table. [\ref=tab:tilingComp] we show the results of the optimization carried out on ten randomly selected sky-localizations from the first two years simulation. Note that reasonable reduction in the required number of tiles is achieved by optimization of the CC-Tiles. However, similar reduction was not observed for ranked-tiling. This indicates that the ranked-tiling strategy gives us a solution that is already close to the optimal solution. The ranked-tiles are therefore an excellent approximation of the continuum sky-localization and with virtually no need for optimization. This is an important point since it liberates the observation efficiency from the choice of the sky-grid. As we argued that many wide FOV telescopes would be using fixed sky-grid to simplify image subtraction, the independence of the ranked-tiling strategy from the choice of the grid is a major advantage.

False positives

We mentioned in Sect. [\ref=sec:intro] that one of the challenges of optical follow-up of GW triggers is that the optical-sky will have a larger number of transients than in any other wavelengths, that can serve as false-positives. Extragalactic transients like supernovae are distributed uniformly over the sky. Galactic interlopers such as M-dwarf flares, binaries that were in eclipse when the reference catalog was made, outbursting CVs (novae and dwarf novae) follow the distribution of stars in the Milky Way, i.e. higher rate of false positives closer to the Galactic Plane. However, both contour covering and ranked-tiling methods roughly cover the similar general part of the sky and hence on an event-by-event basis both methods probe the same population of interlopers. Thus, a false positive probability comparison between the methods can be made assuming that the number of false-positives in any square degree of sky-area is uniform, and hence the number of false-positives is proportional to the observed area. Now, in the preceding sections we have established that the ranked-tiling strategy allows us to reduce the number of tiles required to capture the sky-localization region of any given confidence level. However, one point to note is that while both the ranked-tiling and CC-Tiling strategy cover areas more than the required localization area, the CC-Tiles by definition contains within its boundary the smallest possible sky-localization contour that is obtained from BAYESTAR, but the ranked-tile will not completely contain it (as we can see in Fig. [\ref=fig:3DetComp]). This implies that employing the ranked-tiling strategy, despite requiring smaller number of tiles during the observation, would most often deliver a larger area of the sky to be analyzed and hence would suffer more from false-positives than what one might expect from using CC-Tiles. In Fig. [\ref=fig:falsePositive] we show the increase of the median false-positive upon using the ranked-tiling strategy as a function of FOV of the telescope. For comparison we also present the median tile reduction due to the use of ranked-tiling. We see that the benefits of the rank-tiles come at a price, namely, an increased false-positive probability which can be considered as the "opportunity cost" one pays for using the ranked-tiles. Wider field telescope would benefit more from the ranked-tiling and at the same time would hurt the most from the false-positives. The choice of whether a facility would be willing to accept the elevated false positive probabilities would be governed by what kind of tools are there at their disposal to identify the false positives. For example an optical observation facility that is coverage-constrained, i.e, either has small sky-area coverage per pointing, or requires a large integration time to reach the desired depth in terms of magnitude, or both, but capable of taking images in multiple colors, may find it more beneficial to employ the ranked-tiling strategy to reduce the number of telescope pointings and then use the information for multiple bands to identify the extra false positives. On the other hand, facilities that are not coverage-constrained (very large FOV and small integration time), but lacking the tools to identify the false-positives may choose to implement the contour-covering strategy to reduce the false-positive probability. Fig. [\ref=fig:falsePositive] shows that beyond ~  20 deg2 the tile reduction scales less rapidly with increasing FOV than the false-positives probability, which might hurt the search more. Such telescopes, being less concerned with their ability to cover the sky-localizations and more with the false positive rates, may choose to use CC-Tiles instead of the ranked-tiles.

Based on the studies in the preceding sections, we summarize the pros and cons of the ranked-tiling strategy vis-a-vis the credible-region contour covering strategy:

Pro: Ranked-tiling strategy allows the observers to cover a given localization likelihood with fewer tiles than what is required to cover the confidence region contour.

Pro: Ranked-tiling strategy renders the tile position optimization unimportant and hence one can use a predefined grid to perform accurate image subtraction.

Con: Implementation of ranked-tiling strategy may result in elevated false-positive probabilities compared to CC-Tiles.

Optimization of observation area - monolithic vs distributed field of view

In Sect. [\ref=sec:intro] we inferred that in order to scan the GW sky-localizations during the 2015-16 era with a reasonable chance of detecting an optical counterpart one would need to deploy wide FOV telescopes. Other telescopes may only be successful in this endeavor if they incorporate additional information like galaxy catalogs and distance localization [\citep=3Destimate] [\citep=Gehrels:2015uga]. Such telescopes would target galaxies within the sky-localization region to search for the counterpart and are unlikely to base their search on any sky-tiling strategy, hence in the present analysis we exclude them. A list of wide FOV telescopes (current and up-coming) that could participate in the electromagnetic follow-up of GW triggers can be found in [\cite=0004-637X-767-2-124], [\cite=2041-8205-789-1-L5] and [\cite=Chu:2015jxa].

It is trivially recognizable that the larger a FOV of a given telescope is, the greater is its capability to scan any given sky-localization and coverage can be achieved with fewer pointings than a telescope with a smaller FOV. However, the last point needs some clarification. Even though the observing area scales linearly with the FOV, the coverage of the sky-localization might scale less strongly due to the fact that above a certain size, wider angle telescopes will end up covering a lot more area extraneous to the confidence region contour than less wide angle FOV telescopes. Thus, for example, if a telescope with FOV =  A deg2 requires N non-overlapping pointings to cover a GW sky-localization then another telescope with FOV =  2A deg2 would require â‰¥  N / 2 non-overlapping pointings to cover the same credible-region contour, even though N / 2 non-overlapping pointings of the larger telescope will constitute the same observing area as the N-telescope pointings of the smaller telescope. Since smaller FOV telescopes can tile the localization contour more efficiently, one can imagine the possibility of incorporating multiple smaller telescopes in the form of a distributed FOV array of telescopes with a combined FOV equal to that of a large FOV telescope and expect to cover the credible region more efficiently. However, it is not obvious if the same argument would hold for ranked-tiling. We performed the following analysis to test the implementation of distributed FOV arrays for ranked-tiles. Let us imagine a large FOV telescope with which we would like to scan the sky to detect the optical counterpart corresponding to the mock GW triggers from 2015 and 2016 era. In our studies we use the largest FOV telescope from the previous analysis, namely, 43.2 deg2. We rank-tile the sky-localizations from the first two years in samples of 43.2 deg2 2D intervals. For each GW event we count the number of these ranked-tiles that we need to observe till we reach the location of the simulated GW source. As we go down the list of the ranked-tiles and we observe larger fraction of the sky, more event locations are covered. This is shown in the blue curves of Fig. [\ref=fig:DetectionFracCompAllTelescopes] where we can see that with the increase of the total observing area the fraction of source locations that were covered increases. Next we distribute the 43.2 deg2 FOV into two equal observing area telescopes with 21.6 deg2 FOV each. Fig. [\ref=fig:DetectionFracCompAllTelescopes] shows that this results in a greater fraction of coverage. Two telescopes of half the observing area in each are able to utilize their FOVs more efficiently to cover the highest localization regions, thereby converging to the source location faster than the original telescope with twice the FOV. Continuing this distribution of FOV further we note that the increase in detection fraction steadily increases, underscoring the benefit of using a distributed FOV array over a monolithic FOV telescope in scanning the GW sky-localizations. Dividing the FOV allows us to sample the sky-localization in greater detail. This, on an average, improves the rank of the tile containing the event.

In the upper plot of Fig. [\ref=fig:DetectionFracCompAllTelescopes] we see that in the 2015 sky-localization, when scanning the top 100 deg2 of the ranked-tiles of the sky-localizations, the gain in coverage of the triggers is ~  100% for an array consisting of forty-three 1.0 deg2 or sixteen 2.7 deg2 FOV telescopes compared to a monolithic 43.2 deg2 FOV telescope. Improvement for the triggers in 2016 is slightly less due to overall smaller and less elongated sky-localizations. Nevertheless we found (see lower plot of Fig. [\ref=fig:DetectionFracCompAllTelescopes]) ~  50% gain when we scan the top 100 deg2 of the ranked-tiles using the smaller arrays (1.0 deg2 and 2.7 deg2 FOV) instead of a single 43.2 deg2 FOV telescope. Note that the gain in coverage diminishes rapidly beyond 2.7 deg2 FOV telescopes for the 2015-16 sky-localizations as is evident from the lack of any significant gain in detection upon distributing the FOV further from an array of 2.7 deg2 to an array of 1.0 deg2 FOV.

Fig. [\ref=fig:DetectionFracCompAllTelescopes] also shows that the differences between the distributed FOV arrays and the monolithic telescope are minimal for very large observed areas, which is to be expected since if we were to observe a very large area in the sky, we expect to cover most of the trigger locations regardless of the tiling strategies or whether we use a monolithic telescope or a distributed FOV array. However, we will be able to observe such large areas only for very slowly varying light curves. Moreover many of these large sky-localizations will span across the northern and the southern sky. That is why the most interesting and meaningful part of the plots in Figs. [\ref=fig:DetectionFracCompAllTelescopes] are around ~  100 square degrees. At the smaller observed area regime ([formula] deg2) it is a distributed FOV arrays that could help us in detecting larger fraction of optical counterparts of GW triggers. Therefore, it could be highly productive if wide FOV telescopes around the world coordinate their participation in the optical follow-up GW triggers in the first two years of operation when the LIGO-Virgo sky-localization are expected to be the largest.

Conclusion

As we are getting closer towards the first direct detection of gravitational waves, we are also entering into the era of gravitational wave astronomy. A scenario study for the 2015-16 era performed for the binary neutron star systems showcased what we can expect during the first two years in GW localization. This work uses the results of that study to investigate how well we would be able to cover these localizations on the sky using wide FOV optical telescopes. We examined the performance of the coverage for various different types of telescopes with square FOVs. We found two different ways to tile up the sky to facilitate the observation of the GW sky-localization. The most obvious and simple-minded approach would be to figure out the smallest area of a given confidence interval (90%, 95% etc) on the sky and cover that using the telescopes. We showed in our work that due to the discreteness of the FOV of the optical telescopes, a ranked-tile strategy leads to a better performance as far as number of tiles required is concerned. In this method we first generate a grid that covers the entire sky. Each grid element (which we call a sample) in this grid is of the size of the FOV of the telescope. Next, instead of finding the GW localization contour we compute the localization probability in each sample. We rank these samples based on their localization probability values and select the top samples (ranked-tiles) that cumulatively constitutes the required confidence interval. This strategy also has the an added benefit. It was found in our studies that ranked-tiling makes the optimization of the location of the location of the tiles irrelevant. It ensures that the observer can use a fixed grid of tiles, which is more suitable for image subtraction, without any of the repercussions arising from lack of optimization. We compared the performance of the two methods of tiling up the sky for observation for various sized FOV and different confidence intervals. Larger FOV telescopes and observations conducted over smaller confidence interval regions showed greater benefits from using the ranked-tiles as far as the number of tiles is concerned. We also studied the effect of using these two methods on false positive probability. Our studies shows that even though ranked-tiling method reduces the number of tiles to be observed by the telescopes, it actually increases the amount of area that needs to be analyzed. This results into elevated false positive probability upon using ranked-tiling, which is the one limitation of the ranked-tiling method. We investigated the false positive probability for various FOV telescopes and found that the effect is the highest for larger FOV telescopes.

Finally we investigated the performance of distributed FOV arrays of wide field of view telescope (â‰¥   1.0 deg2) with that of the traditional monolithic FOV telescopes in scanning of the 2015 and 2016 gravitational wave sky-localization regions. Our studies showed clear benefit from using such arrays. The distributed FOV arrays need not be a single facility containing an array of identical telescopes. It could very well be multiple wide FOV optical telescopes around the world with diverse FOVs operating in a joint fashion. Non local telescopes in such arrays will have greater sky coverage which could be extremely beneficial in the first two years given the size and structures of the expected GW sky-localizations.
