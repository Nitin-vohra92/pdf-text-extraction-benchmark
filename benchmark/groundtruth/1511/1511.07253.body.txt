Introduction

A partial line spread F in [formula], the projective space of dimensions N over the Galois field [formula] of order q, is a set of pairwise skew lines. We say that F is maximal if it cannot be extended to a larger partial line spread. A line spread in [formula], N odd, is a set of pairwise skew lines covering the space.

Here, we consider a hyperplane H of [formula] and a partial line spread F of H, of size q3 + 1, which is the largest size of MPS in [formula]. So, in H there are exactly q2 holes, that is points not over the lines of F.

We start by adding to F a set of q2 pairwise skew lines, not of H, covering the holes of H, obtaining a maximal partial spread in [formula] of size q3 + q2 + 1. We proceed by depriving the obtained maximal partial spread in [formula] of some lines of H and adding q + 1 pairwise skew lines not of H for each removed line. We do this through a theoretical way for every value of q, and by a computer search for q  ≤  7. More precisely we prove that for every q there are maximal partial line spreads of the sizes q3 + q2 + kq + 1, for any [formula], k an integer, while by a computer search we get cardinalities q3 + q2 + kq + 1, for larger values of k, for [formula].

Moreover, by a computer search, we find the sizes for the largest maximal partial spreads in [formula] for [formula]: we prove that the largest maximal partial line spreads have deficiency δ = 2 for q = 2, [formula] for q = 3,5 and [formula] for q = 4.

Again by a computer search, we find many new results for [formula].

Known results

Maximal partial line spreads (from now on MPS) in [formula] have been investigated by several authors.

In [\cite=beut1], Beutelspacher proved the existence of MPS of size q3 + q2 + 1. In [\cite=gova], Govaerts showed that this size is the smallest size for MPS in [formula].

We recall that a spread in [formula], N odd, have size

[formula]

Also, we have the following results.

([\cite=gaszon1]) For any q odd and for q even, q > q0, in [formula] [formula] odd, there exist maximal partial spreads of any size between 9NqN - 2 log q and [formula].

We remark that the above interval is empty for q  ≤  243. So, for q  ≤  7, the only known sizes are q3 + q2 + 1 and the size of a spread.

Upper bounds for the size of the largest example of MPS were achieved by Govaerts and Storme [\cite=govastor2] [\cite=govastor1].

If S is a partial line spread of [formula], N odd, and [formula], then we say that S has deficiency δ.

([\cite=govastor1]) Let ε = 2 in the case q = 2 and let q + ε be the size of the smallest non-trivial blocking sets in [formula] in the case q > 2. Suppose N odd and δ  <  ε. Unless δ = 0 there exist no maximal partial line spreads with deficiency δ in [formula].

([\cite=govastor1]) Let S be a partial s-spread of [formula], N odd, of deficiency δ > 0. Then

([\cite=bruen1]) [formula] when q is square;

([\cite=blok2]) δ  ≥  cpq2 / 3 + 1, when q = ph, h odd, h > 2, p prime, c2 = c3 = 2- 1 / 3 and cp = 1 for p > 3;

([\cite=blok1]) [formula] when q is an odd prime.

([\cite=govastor2]) Let S be a maximal partial line spread of [formula], N odd, q > 16, of deficiency [formula]. Then [formula] ([formula]) and the set of holes of S is the disjoint union of subgeometries [formula]. Moreover, [formula] when q > 4.

A geometric construction of maximal partial line spreads in [formula]

We start by proving the following lemma, similarly to Lemma 2.1 in [\cite=iura3].

In [formula], q a prime power, let S be a hyperplane and X a point of S. Let L be a set of lines not of S, not through X, not two of them meeting outside S, and such that [formula]. Then there is a line through X not of S and skew to every line of L.

Let H be a hyperplane of [formula] and let F be a largest partial line spread of H, the size of which is q3 + 1. So, in H there are exactly q2 holes, that is points not over the lines of F. By Lemma [\ref=lemma] it follows that there exists a set of q3 mutually disjoint lines of [formula], not of H, covering any set of q3 points of H. So, we choose a line set F' of q2 lines, not in H, covering the q2 holes of H. In this way we get a maximal partial spread [formula] of [formula], with size q3 + q2 + 1. At this point we deprive F of a line r1 and cover the points of r1 through q + 1 lines, [formula], not of H, whose existence is guaranteed by above lemma, obtaining the MPS

[formula]

We proceed depriving F1 of a line r2 of F and, by using the above lemma again, we find q + 1 mutually skew lines [formula], not of H and covering r2. The line set

[formula]

is a MPS of size q3 + q2 + 2q + 1.

We proceed up to deprive F of [formula] lines, obtaining a MPS

[formula]

with q3 + q2 + nq + 1 lines.

So, we give a class of maximal partial line spreads of sizes q3 + q2 + kq + 1, with [formula].

So we get the following theorem.

In [formula], q a prime power, there are maximal partial line spreads of size q3 + q2 + kq + 1, for every integer [formula].

We note that, for N = 5 and [formula],

[formula]

and so the theorem gives [formula] unknown cardinalities for any q.

Computer search of maximal partial line spreads in [formula]

We firstly report, in the Table [\ref=tab1], for the investigated values of q, the minimum sizes q3 + q2 + 1, the maximum sizes (see Theorem [\ref=epsilon] and Corollary [\ref=delta]), the size [formula] (see Theorem [\ref=teo2]) and the sizes of the spreads [formula].

In the Table [\ref=tab2], we report the obtained cardinalities of type q3 + q2 + k  ·  q + 1 of MPS, for q  ≤  7, by the Theorem [\ref=teo2.2] and by the first algorithm for the computer search.

In the Table [\ref=tab2], kmin = 1 and [formula]; kmax is the maximum value of k and [formula].

So we get the following theorem:

In [formula], [formula], there are maximal partial line spreads of size q3 + q2 + kq + 1, for every integer [formula].

We now report all the obtained cardinalities by computer search, that we denote by b + knm  ·  q, where b = q3 + q2 + 1 and m  ≤  k  ≤  n, k integer. The underlined values are those not known and that cannot be obtained through the Theorem [\ref=teo2.2].

We note that all smallest MPS have sizes of type q3 + q2 + kq + 1, while, starting from a certain size, there are all the possible sizes.

By the previous result, we get the following theorem (see also Table [\ref=tab1]).

In [formula], [formula], the largest maximal partial line spreads have deficiency δ = 2 for q = 2, [formula] for q = 3,5 and [formula] for q = 4.

The Theorem [\ref=teo2], for N = 5 and q = 3,4,5, can be modified as follows.

In [formula], q = 3,4,5, there exist maximal partial line spreads of any size between 2q3 log q and [formula].
