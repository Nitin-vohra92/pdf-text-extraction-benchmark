The Definitive X-ray Light Curve of Swift J164449.3+573451

Introduction

On 2011 March 28, the Swift satellite [\citep=Gehrels04_Swift] triggered on a new source, Swift J164449.3+573451 (Swift J1644+57 hereafter). Swift J1644+57 triggered the Swift Burst Alert Telescope [\citep=Barthelmy05] three more times over the next two days, a clear indication that it was not a gamma-ray burst (GRB). Observations by the Swift X-ray Telescope [\citep=Burrows05_XRT] revealed an extremely variable, but previously undetected X-ray source [\citep=Burrows11_SwiftJ1644], which was found to be located at the center of a galaxy at a redshift of 0.354 [\citep=Levan11_SwiftJ1644]. A consensus quickly developed that this object was a highly beamed tidal disruption event [\citep=Bloom11_SwiftJ1644] [\citep=Levan11_SwiftJ1644] [\citep=Burrows11_SwiftJ1644] [\citep=Zauderer11_SwiftJ1644].

Because the extinction in the host galaxy is so high, the value of extinction adopted drives the inferred slope of the inherent optical-NIR portion of the spectrum, which in turn drives the interpretation of the X-ray spectrum. [\citet=Burrows11_SwiftJ1644] found that the host extinction was AV  ≈  4.5, which led to a positive slope of the intrinsic spectrum in the optical band and our conclusion that the optical and X-ray bands were both part of the same synchrotron component. This interpretation required that the radio emission originate in a different emission region, which we proposed was in the external shock. [\citet=Zauderer11_SwiftJ1644] and [\citet=Metzger12_SwiftJ1644] came to similar conclusions, based on their radio observations. [\citet=Bloom11_SwiftJ1644], on the other hand, concluded that the radio and NIR/optical emission originated in the same synchrotron component.

Prior to the discovery of Swift J1644+57, relativistic jets created by tidal disruption around dormant black holes (BHs) had only rarely been discussed in the literature on TDE theory (e.g., [\citealt=Giannios11]; cf. [\citealt=Rees88] [\citealt=Ayal00] [\citealt=Bogdanovic04] [\citealt=Gomboc05] [\citealt=Brassart08] [\citealt=Strubbe09] [\citealt=Guillochon09] [\citealt=Brassart10]). These earlier works generally considered scenarios in which a solar mass star is tidally disrupted by a supermassive black hole (SMBH), roughly half of the stellar mass is captured with the remainder of the disrupted star ejected into hyperbolic orbits, and visible, UV, and X-ray flares are produced by the impulsive compression of the star, the resulting accretion disk, and/or the outflowing material. In retrospect, it is not surprising that a jet could be formed in a TDE, as the SMBHs in an active galactic nucleus (AGN) produce jets under conditions of ongoing accretion. The unique aspect of this discovery was the detailed observation in the X-ray band of the turn-on of a jet in a previously dormant SMBH.

The discovery of this event produced a flurry of publications providing interpretation of the data. While most authors (including [\citetalias=Burrows11_SwiftJ1644]) argued for a solar mass star being tidally disrupted by a SMBH, [\citet=Krolik11_SwiftJ1644] preferred a white dwarf being disrupted by an intermediate mass BH in order to explain the rapid time variability. [\citet=Cannizzo11_SwiftJ1644] suggested that the star was on an orbit with a very small impact parameter, and the resulting plunge deep into the SMBH potential well totally disrupted the star, which was then completely swallowed by the BH.

The purpose of the present work is the complete analysis of the Swift/XRT follow-up data of Swift J1644+57 from the beginning to the end of the outburst, which occurred on 2012 August 17th, 507 days after the initial BAT trigger, and the following monitoring observations by Swift/XRT and Chandra/ACIS. We present the updated complete version of the flux light curve of the event and its analysis and interpretation.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=sec:obs] we describe the data set. In Section [\ref=sec:redu] we describe in detail the data reduction and analysis procedures performed to obtain the final X-ray light curve of Swift J1644+57. In Sections [\ref=sec:lcfit] and [\ref=sec:dips] we analyze the light curve structure and late time behavior. In Section [\ref=sec:discussion] we discuss our results and their implications in the context of tidal disruption models of a star by a SMBH associated to relativistic jet ejection. Finally, in Section [\ref=sec:conclusions] we summarize our findings and conclusions.

Throughout this paper the errors on count rates are at 1σ [\citep=Evans07] [\citep=Evans09], and the quoted uncertainties on model parameters are given at 90% confidence level for one interesting parameter (i.e., Δχ2 = 2.71) unless otherwise stated. Times t are referenced to the initial BAT trigger T0 as t = T - T0, unless otherwise specified. We adopt a standard cosmology model with H0  =  70 km s- 1 Mpc- 1, ΩM  =  0.3, ΩΛ  =  0.7.

Observations

Swift J1644+57 triggered the Swift/BAT twice on 2011 March 28th, resulting in automated observations by Swift/XRT. It was intensively observed by Swift for the first four months and then was regularly monitored with single snapshots of 1 ks exposure per day, at diminishing rate per week. The whole Swift follow-up and monitoring campaign of Swift J1644+57 from discovery up to three years later consists of ~  700 sequences and four different trigger numbers: 450158 (seq. 0-  7, from 2011 March 28 to 2011 March 30), 31955 (seq. 2-255, from 2011 March 31 to 2011 December 06), 32200 (seq. 1-237, from 2011 December 07 to 2012 August 15), and 32526 (seq. 1-200, from 2012 August 16 to 2014 March 28). The total XRT exposure in the data set is 2 Ms in Photon Counting (PC) mode and 320 ks in Windowed Timing (WT) mode [\citep=Burrows05_XRT].

We also re-analyze the 24.7 ks Chandra-ACIS ToO observation (PI: Tanvir), performed on 2012 November 26, and present analysis results for a second ACIS observation of 27.7 ks exposure performed by Chandra on 2015 February 17 (PI: Levan).

The reference time used to plot all the light curves and parameter evolution curves is the time of the first BAT trigger T0, corresponding to T0 =   2011 March 28 12:57:45.201 UTC =   55648.5401 MJD.

Data Reduction and Analysis

The XRT data have been reprocessed with the HEASOFT 6.15.1 package, and the latest calibration files (version 20140610) have been used for pile-up correction and spectral response matrices production.

For light curve and hardness ratio curve extraction (see Sections [\ref=subsec:rate_lc] and [\ref=subsec:hr_lc]), an annular region centered at the source position with variable inner radius has been used when pile-up correction was required, and a circular region with outer radius decreasing with the average brightness ,of the source has been used in all other cases. A minimum extraction radius of 10 pixels (23.6arcsec) has been used starting from 2012 August 17 (day 508 since the trigger, sequence 00032526002). The background region for observations in PC mode has been selected as a set of circular regions surrounding the source where no serendipitous source was detected in the image of the summed PC observations (2 Ms exposure). The background region used for observations in WT mode in [\citetalias=Burrows11_SwiftJ1644] was an annular region with 65arcsec inner radius and 70arcsec outer radius. Here we preferred a constant background subtraction, with background rate estimated from average background spectra described below. This procedure allows for more reliable results, especially in the soft (highly absorbed) band 0.3-  10 keV.

To extract time resolved spectra (see Section [\ref=subsec:spectra]) and average spectra in or outside the light curve dips (see Section [\ref=sec:dips]), source regions matching the ones used for the light curve in each corresponding time interval have been generally used. PC background spectra have been extracted from simultaneous data using an annular region centered on the source position with inner radius of 119 pixels (~  281arcsec) and outer radius of 153 pixels (~  362arcsec), unless otherwise stated. For the WT spectra, in order to maximize the background statistics, only two background spectra have been created: i) an average background spectrum (15 ks exposure) from the summed WT observations in sequences 00450158000-06, used for the early (<  10 d) WT spectra; ii) an average background spectrum (296.5 ks exposure) from the summed WT observations in sequences 00031955014-40, used in all other cases. Both background spectra have been extracted from an annular region centered on the source with 85 pixels (~  200arcsec) inner radius and 118 pixels (~  279arcsec) outer radius. Spectra have been generally binned to at least 20 counts per energy bin to allow for fitting in χ2 statistics within xspec, unless otherwise stated. Ancillary response files were generated with the task xrtmkarf within HEASOFT, and account for different extraction regions and point-spread function corrections.

Chandra-ACIS data have been analyzed with the CIAO software package (v4.7), using the calibration database CALDB (v4.6.7) and standard ACIS data filtering. We used the wavedetect task for source detection. The source and background regions used for count rate estimation and spectral extraction are a circle centered on the source position with 1 radius, and a source free annular region with 15arcsec inner radius and 45arcsec outer radius, respectively. For spectral analysis the data were binned to 1 count per energy bin to allow for fitting with Cash statistics [\citep=Cash79] in xspec (with χ2 statistic test evaluation enabled). Chandra results are presented and discussed in Section [\ref=subsec:residual].

Count Rate Light Curve

The 0.3-  10 keV count rate light curve shown in Figure [\ref=fig:XRT_lc] was produced by binning the net source counts in order to have at least 200 counts per time bin at early times, and progressively decreasing the level of required counts per bin down to at least 10 counts per bin at late times, up to sequence 00032526001, observed on 2012 August 16, 507 days after the trigger. On day 508 the source emission suddenly dropped below the detection threshold for a 1-  2 ks single snapshot observation [\citep=Sbarufatti12_ATel_SwiftJ1644]. A detailed plot of the abrupt drop is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:Aug-Sept], where data from 2012 August and September have been binned daily. The daily count rate measured in the source region (red histogram) is compared to the expected background count rate in the source region on the same day (blue histogram). When Swift J1644+57 is not detected, the 3σ upper limit on source count rate is shown. The plot shows that the count rate drops abruptly on day 508 (2012 August 17). By comparing the count rate on day 507 and the level of the deepest upper limit we see in Figure [\ref=fig:Aug-Sept] (on day 537) we can state that we had a drop of more than a factor 11 in one month, i.e. a fraction of 0.06 of the total time elapsed.

The very last point in the light curve of Figure [\ref=fig:XRT_lc] is the detection obtained from the summed 191 monitoring observations performed from 2012 August 17th (marked by the green dashed vertical line) to 2014 March 28th, for a total of 284.5 ks exposure. We extracted the source counts from a circular region of 10 pixels radius (314 pixel2 area) and estimated the background contribution from counts found in the background region (21,143 pixel2 area, specifically selected to avoid contamination from any field source detected in the whole PC data set) and rescaled to the source region area. We obtained 78 total counts in the source region in the 0.3-  10 keV band with an estimated background of 44 counts and applied the technique of [\citet=Kraft91] to calculate the upper and lower 99% confidence limits on source counts. These correspond to an average count rate of 1.2+ 0.9- 0.7  ×  10- 4 s- 1. The source is also detected on the summed image of the post-drop monitoring with the ximage command sosta, centered on the position of source with user defined source and background regions, at the level 1.5  ±  0.4  ×  10- 4 s- 1 with 3.8σ significance.

Hardness Ratio

The band ratio and hardness ratio curves of Swift J1644+57 are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:HR]. We have defined the energy range 0.3-  1.5 keV as the soft band (S) and the energy range 1.5-  10 keV as the hard band (H). We have calculated both the ratio of the counts detected in the two bands (H/S) and the hardness ratio (H-S)/(H+S). The curves have been binned in order to have at least 500 net counts in each band up to day 507 post-trigger. For the last point (covering the time interval from day 508 to day 1096) net counts in the required bands were derived from the summed post-drop observations with the same procedure used for the count rate light curve. Errors have been estimated in the Poisson approximation [\citep=Gehrels86] and propagated with standard error propagation formulae. At the beginning, both curves show variations tracking the light curve flares, with the hardness rising when the average rate increases, and decaying when the average rate decreases. But later phases with different trends can be identified. We observe a hardness plateau phase from ~  2.4 to ~  16 days post-trigger, corresponding to a phase of average rate decrease (from ~  2.4 to ~  6 days) followed by a rapid rise by a factor ~  10 in ~  0.3 days and a shallow decay afterwards. After 16 days, while the average rate in the light curve goes on decaying steadily, we observe a relatively rapid (~  1 day long) drop (i.e. softening) in the hardness followed by a steep rising (i.e. hardening) phase that lasts up to ~  100 days, when a final hardness plateau phase starts. In both cases the last point represents a clearly different and much softer spectral state compared to the final trend of the curve. A comparable softness is attained only at a few light curve minima between flares (e.g. the first one at ~  0.2 days), which are minima for the band ratio and hardness ratio curves as well. If the abrupt Swift J1644+57 emission drop on day 508 is due to the turn-off of the jet [\citep=Zauderer13_SwiftJ1644], which might be likely caused by a transition to a thin disk as the accretion rate dropped below a critical value of several tens of percent of the Eddington accretion rate [\citep=Zauderer13_SwiftJ1644] [\citep=Tchekhovskoy14_SwiftJ1644], then the low-level residual emission we detected later should have a different origin and this discontinuity in the hardness curves would not be surprising.

We see evidence of different spectral phases during Swift J1644+57  evolution also in Figure [\ref=fig:HRvsRATE], where the soft band ratio S/(H+S) is plotted against the total rate (H+S) in the 0.3-  10 keV band. Here XRT data in different operation mode are color-coded as in the previous figures, and different markers distinguish early emission (before 2.4 days, filled circles) from intermediate (between 2.4 and 39 days, empty stars) and late emission (after 39 days, empty triangles). According to this plot early data show an anti-correlation between the soft band ratio and the overall count rate i.e. a trend for harder spectra at higher rates. The correlation is tighter for WT data. PC data are more dispersed and seem to lie on a different correlation, also consistent with the harder-when-brighter trend. Late data are in PC mode only, and follow an opposite trend of harder spectra at lower rates despite the large dispersion. Intermediate data populate the central part of the plot. Part of these (WT data up to 23 days, dark blue empty stars) were included in the corresponding plot in [\citetalias=Burrows11_SwiftJ1644] (Supplementary Figure 4) and are interpreted as a second branch of the WT harder-when-brighter correlation after a count-rate discontinuity at ~  4 s- 1. The inclusion of the remaining WT data (light blue empty stars) has not completed the correlation in the left upward direction as expected, but simply thickened the data cloud on the left direction. Note that count rates as low as those reached by the WT data in Figure [\ref=fig:XRT_lc] are not seen in this plot because of the different binning criterion used. The intermediate PC data populate the bottom of the central cloud, spanning a range in rates comparable to the intermediate WT data, but with much less spread in softness (consistent with the plateau observed in Figure [\ref=fig:HR] between 2.4 and 16 days). With the possible exception of intermediate PC data, intermediate WT and late PC data in Figure [\ref=fig:HRvsRATE] may be interpreted as a single component obtained by shifting leftwards and downwards with time an anti-correlation law similar to the one followed by the early WT data. This result could be obtained with a global hardening with time superimposed on a strict hardness-tracking-brightness rule on the smaller variability timescales of flares and dips.

Spectral Analysis and Conversion to Flux

The XRT team's on-line light curve repository [\citep=Evans09] uses a single conversion factor between count rate and flux (ECF), determined using an automated spectral fit of the PC mode data. This works well for GRBs, since there is rarely any significant spectral evolution after the first few ks of the afterglow, but it does not work well for Swift J1644+57, due to the extremely strong spectral variations during the first few hundred days (Figure [\ref=fig:HR]). A more realistic conversion to flux can be obtained via time-dependent spectral analysis. The procedure, which we already applied in [\citetalias=Burrows11_SwiftJ1644], consists of the following steps: i) split the data set into a sequence of short time intervals tracking the hardness states of the source but with enough counting statistics to use standard χ2 fitting techniques, and extract spectra for each time interval; ii) fit each spectrum, derive the ECF corresponding to the best-fit model, and create a stepped ECF evolution law; iii) convert the count rate light curve to flux by applying at each point an ECF obtained through a cubic spline interpolation of the ECF stepped curve.

The conversion applied in [\citetalias=Burrows11_SwiftJ1644] was limited to the first 50 days of the Swift J1644+57 outburst, and was based on spectral modeling with the log-parabola model defined as [formula] where α is the photon index and β is a measure of the curvature compared to a simple power law, which is obtained for β  =  0. The complete spectral model we use also includes two absorption components: a Galactic one with [formula] fixed to 1.7 ×   1020 cm- 2 [\citep=Kalberla05] and an intrinsic one at redshift z = 0.35 with NH allowed to vary with time. The log-parabola model has been introduced as a good empirical fit for broadband spectral distributions of BL Lacs and other blazar sources. The version we use corresponds to the model logpar in xspec [\citep=Massaro04_log-parabola] with (constant) parameter pivot-E (representing the low end of the energy range used in the fit) fixed to 1 keV, and curvature parameter equal to -  β. In [\citetalias=Burrows11_SwiftJ1644] we reported that the log-parabola spectral model generally provided better fits than a simple power law to both time and intensity-selected spectra of Swift J1644+57, though power-law fits were statistically acceptable. However, in about 74% of cases the best-fit value of the parameter β was consistent with zero within its uncertainties, making the model perfectly equivalent to a power law (see Supplementary Figure 11 in [\citetalias=Burrows11_SwiftJ1644]), but with substantially larger errors on both the intrinsic absorption column and the photon index compared to the power-law fit.

For the present paper, we complete the set of time-dependent spectra used in [\citetalias=Burrows11_SwiftJ1644] with more spectra extracted from the data collected after the first 50 days and before the light curve drop, reaching a total of 215 spectra (163 in WT mode and 52 in PC mode). We have reanalyzed the whole data set with updated spectral response files, fitting each spectrum with both power-law and log-parabola models. Since these two models are suitable for an F-test [\citep=Protassov02], we apply it to estimate the probability P of chance improvement of the χ2 and reject all the log-parabola fits with P >   0.01. This condition rejects 195 of the log-parabola fits (including all the best-fit solutions with β consistent with zero within errors) i.e., according to this selection the log-parabola model significantly improves the fit only for 20 spectra (15 in WT mode and 5 in PC mode). Thus, for every further calculation, we decided to use the power-law fit results for all the spectra but the 20 for which the log-parabola fit represents a significant improvement.

We also extracted and analyzed a spectrum from the summed PC data collected after the drop in the light curve, choosing source and background extraction regions as we did for the final count rate and hardness ratio calculation. In this case the data were binned to 1 count per energy bin to allow for fitting with Cash statistics [\citep=Cash79] in xspec (with χ2 statistic test evaluation enabled). The very low statistics do not allow for a fit with an absorbed power-law with both intrinsic NH and photon index free or an absorbed log-parabola model in this case. We modeled the spectrum with an absorbed power-law with intrinsic NH fixed to 1.9 ×   1022 cm- 2. The best fit photon index is [formula]. The fit is poor and the uncertainty is very large. Γ values larger than 2 are likely to be preferred because corresponding models give H/S <   1.5. The correct band ratio may be achieved also with Γ values smaller than 2 and lower intrinsic NH. We then performed a second fit with Γ fixed to 1 and free intrinsic NH. The fit is apparently equivalent to the previous one and formally gives NH <  0.5 ×   1022 cm- 2, but the model cannot reproduce an H / S  ~  1 unless NH is zero.

Our final best-fit results, including those for the post-drop spectrum, are listed in Table 1 and shown in Figure [\ref=fig:param]. The log-parabola model is a curved model with a broad minimum in the spectrum at E[formula] keV if β  >  0, or a broad peak at energy Ecrit for β  <  0. Note that among the log-parabola best-fit models that survive our selection, we have five with positive values of β and all of them correspond to PC spectra. In all cases Ecrit is in the 2.5-  6.0 keV range, well within the Swift/XRT energy band, but the peak/minimum is so broad compared to the band (relative width ~   [formula]) that almost no curvature can be seen by eye in the spectrum. Finally, the 20 log-parabola fits show a strong correlation between NH, photon index, and β. This is apparently unrelated to any physical status, because the 20 spectra do not show any common property (e.g. corresponding to peaks or minima, showing pile-up, etc.). We are led to believe that in these 20 special cases the log-parabola fits are merely approximate descriptions that we cannot use for any other purpose than flux estimation.

The ECFs to be used for the final conversion from count rate (Figure [\ref=fig:XRT_lc]) to 0.3-  10 keV observed flux are derived from the best-fit results listed in Table 1 and are shown in the left panel of Figure [\ref=fig:ECF], while in the right panel of the same figure we show the corresponding ECFs for conversion into 0.3-  10 keV unabsorbed flux. Note that in this latter case the five log-parabola best-fit models with β  >  0 lead to higher than average values of the ECF, and all those with β  <  0 lead to lower than average values of the ECFs. This is due to log-parabola spectra with β > 0 having larger than average NH values and softer than average photon indices, as opposed to the β < 0 solutions, for which the opposite is true. The correction for the absorption leads to a larger scatter in the ECFs. The absolute average deviation of the ECFs (i.e. the average of their differences from the mean value, taken in absolute value) rises from 7% to 15% of the mean value going from the left panel to the right panel in Figure [\ref=fig:ECF].

The final light curve in observed and unabsorbed flux will be introduced and discussed in Section [\ref=subsec:flux_lc]. Note that the ECFs for the observed flux after day 15 change systematically, mirroring the strong variations in the band and hardness ratio plots of Figure [\ref=fig:HR]. This could lead to a different slope for the overall decay rate than would be obtained using a single mean ECF. The ECFs for the unabsorbed flux, instead, show an average constant trend after day 15, in better agreement with the standard XRT light curve repository.

A closer look at the temporal evolution of the spectral parameters in Figure [\ref=fig:param] shows that the variations of both the intrinsic NH and the photon index approximately track the rate, but with opposite trends: the NH tends to be higher at higher rates, while the photon index tends to be lower at higher rates, at least for the early portions of the light curve. These different behaviors are visible in Figure [\ref=fig:ParvsFlux], where the photon indices and the intrinsic absorption columns of the time-resolved spectra of Swift J1644+57 well fit by an absorbed power-law model are plotted as a function of the 2-  10 keV flux. The photon index plot (left panel) shows a structure similar to the soft band ratio versus rate plot in Figure [\ref=fig:HRvsRATE], though a larger dispersion in the different groups of data is clearly seen. The intrinsic NH plot (right panel) has a different structure, with early data (filled circles) showing a more-absorbed-when-brighter trend, and late data (empty triangles) suggesting a moderately increasing absorption as the flux decays. The intermediate data (empty stars) are more difficult to interpret because of the large dispersion, but seem to follow a trend similar to early data. A general trend of intrinsic NH decreasing with time is confirmed by a linear fit of NH versus log 10t. With t in units of days we obtain an intercept at 1 day of (1.98±  0.02)×  1022 cm- 2 and a linear coefficient of -0.44±  0.02, with a χ2r  =  1.522 (213 dof). An analogous fit for the photon index gives an intercept at 1 day of 1.82±  0.01 and a linear coefficient of -0.40±  0.01, with a χ2r  =  1.885 (213 dof), and confirms the general trend for hardening of the spectra we already noted in Section [\ref=subsec:hr_lc].

X-ray Flux Light Curve

The final light curves of Swift J1644+57 in observed flux and unabsorbed flux are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:flux_lc_comp]. The conversion procedure and the time-dependent ECFs used are described in Section [\ref=subsec:spectra]. Note that discrepancies between the two curves are largest in the time intervals from 0.07 days after the BAT trigger to ~  0.5 days, and from 6 to 15 days. The overall later decay does not seem dramatically affected by the correction for the absorption. Models of TDEs give predictions about the decay of the intrinsic luminosity of the source. For this reason the unabsorbed flux light curve of Swift J1644+57 should be used in testing models. This one is shown alone in Figure [\ref=fig:flux_lc] and listed in Table 2.

The X-ray light curve of Swift J1644+57  differs from the typical X-ray afterglow light curve of a GRB in many respects. In Figure [\ref=fig:lum_lc_vs_grb] we compare the X-ray light curve of Swift J1644+57 to that of GRB 060729, the longest GRB X-ray light curve ever obtained [\citep=Grupe10].

Both curves are shown in terms of the X-ray luminosity, LX,iso, calculated assuming isotropic emission, and are plotted in the source rest frame.

The LX,iso light curve of GRB 060729 has a canonical afterglow shape, with a flat plateau phase followed by a power-law decay similar to the late average decay of Swift J1644+57, but starting about 30 times earlier and running three orders of magnitude below the Swift J1644+57 light curve for t  >  10 days. As illustrated by GRB 060729, GRB afterglows are typically fairly smooth; they may show flares (usually in the first day, before and/or during the plateau phase) but never show dips, nor has a GRB ever exhibited a range of variability like that seen in Swift J1644+57, which uniformly spans more than one order of magnitude throughout its evolution. Moreover, GRB afterglows rarely exhibit spectral evolution after the first day, while we have shown that Swift J1644+57 exhibits strong spectral evolution for well over a year.

The overall shape of the X-ray light curve of Swift J1644+57  also differs from typical X-ray light curves from long-term monitoring of blazars, the class of AGN sources with observed radiation dominated by the emission from relativistic jets pointing at the observer. The typical dynamic range of blazar flares in X-rays is a factor of a few, not several orders of magnitude, and the typical activity duty cycle is small compared to that of the initial flares of Swift J1644+57 [\citep=Krolik11_SwiftJ1644].

Light curve decay

The X-ray light curve of Swift J1644+57 is highly variable and affected by bright flares and deep dips at irregular intervals throughout the whole XRT monitoring, but overall, there appears to be a continuous trend underlying the flaring and dipping activity in the light curve starting about 6 days after the trigger. The upper envelope appears to follow a steady power-law decay from about ~  6 days post-trigger to the end of the outburst. The modeling of this global trend is important for the interpretation of the phenomenon. In order to do it, we proceeded as follows:

(1) we generated a set of six progressively smoothed light curves by rebinning the unabsorbed flux light curve computed in Section [\ref=subsec:flux_lc] using a decreasing number of time intervals per decade of days, uniformly spaced in log (t), according to the sequence 32, 16, 8, 4, 3, and 2 intervals per decade (see Fig [\ref=fig:smoothlc]). For each time interval we calculated a rebinned point with time and flux coordinates obtained from the arithmetic averages of the logarithms of the times ([formula]) and the fluxes (fX) of all the data points therein. No error estimate through error propagation has been performed because errors of the single data points are negligible compared to the dispersion of the points.

(2) we fit each smoothed light curve segment between 6 and 508 days post-trigger with a linear model in the [formula] plane (i.e., [formula] =   [formula]) and derived the best-fit value of the slope s as a function of the number of rebinned points.

(3) we calculated the mean and sample variance of the six values of s obtained in (2) and used the result as a measure of the average slope of the flux light curve in the 6-  508 days time interval.

We obtained a final decay slope of 1.48  ±  0.03. We checked the effect on the average decay slope of our time-dependent flux conversion by applying the same procedure (steps 1, 2, and 3 above) to an unabsorbed flux light curve obtained with a uniform conversion factor and to the flux light curve in the on-line repository as well. We obtained values for the average decay slope in the 6-  508 days time interval of 1.47  ±  0.02 and 1.45  ±  0.05, respectively. Both values are consistent within the errors with 1.48  ±  0.03. This suggests that our time-dependent conversion to unabsorbed flux does not affect the average decay slope of the light curve, though enhancing dispersion. Moreover, our light curve allows for a more accurate estimate of the average decay slope compared to the repository light curve.

The average decay slope value we obtained is definitely not consistent with the expected slope of . The latter is considered a signature of tidal disruption because in the classical model by [\citet=Rees88] and its updated versions [\citep=Lodato09] the decay law of the mass accretion rate resulting from fall-back of the disrupted stellar debris onto the central BH is expected to be [formula], or at least asymptotically converging to this. The same analysis applied to the observed flux light curve has been presented in [\citet=mangano_swift10proc]. In that case we obtained a final decay slope of 1.36  ±  0.02, which is consistent at the 2σ level with , i.e. the slope value in the decay law for the jet luminosity in case of super-Eddington slim accretion disk formation [\citep=Cannizzo09]. However, the average decay slope value of the unabsorbed flux light curve is also not consistent with . The measured slope may be consistent with the TDE phenomenon when more realistic physics of accretion disks is properly taken into account [\citep=Cannizzo11_SwiftJ1644].

Could it be that the actual TDE began much earlier than the nominal March 28 BAT trigger, and therefore the decay slope calculated from the true t  =  0 was steeper? We have investigated the possibility suggested by [\citet=Tchekhovskoy14_SwiftJ1644] that the t = 0 time appropriate for the average light curve decay may lie earlier than the BAT trigger time by Δtoffset days. For this purpose, we repeated the fits of our six smoothed light curves with the model [formula] =   [formula] and calculated the average best-fit slopes for all integer values of Δtoffset from 1 to 45 days. The plot of the average slope s versus Δtoffset is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:slope-offset]. A slope consitent with at 1σ is found for Δtoffset  ~  6 days.

The degeneracy between decay steepness s and Δtoffset revealed in Figure [\ref=fig:slope-offset] can be quantitatively resolved by considering the form of the decay law, and the basic properties of the TDE decay. After a TDE occurs, there is negligible accretion from stellar fallback for ~  tfb, the fallback time for the most tightly bound debris to return to the BH and to begin to accrete. [\citet=Tchekhovskoy14_SwiftJ1644] suggest that following tfb there may elapse an additional Δtoffset for magnetic flux accumulation in the inner disk to build up to the point that the jet becomes active. Therefore, one expects a gap of tfb  +  Δtoffset, after which accretion begins, followed by a power law decay [formula], where s≃1 - 2, in the rate of supply of fallback gas to the central engine. However, the accretion-powered jet does not become visible until a time tfb  +  Δtoffset following the TDE. Thus in this idealization

[formula]

Inherent in this formalism is the assumption that the jet luminosity LJ tracks the accretion rate [formula] from the inner accretion disk onto the BH for t  ≥  tfb  +  Δtoffset. The smooth power-law decay trend observed in the late XRT light curve supports the idea of a simple linear relation between LJ and [formula] out to t≃500 days.

By considering the ratio of the peak X-ray flux to the fluence [formula] where t1  =  tfb  +  Δtoffset, one can directly measure tfb  +  Δtoffset [\citep=Gao12_SwiftJ1644] . From the functional form for fX(t), one may write

[formula]

Note that since this argument depends only on the ratio of fluence and peak flux, all uncertainties such as beaming angle, accretion efficiency, jet efficiency, and distance cancel out. Using our measured values fX, max≃9  ×  10- 9 erg cm- 2 s- 1 and fluence ΔEX≃6  ×  10- 4 erg cm- 2 yields tfb  +  Δtoffset≃0.9 days for [formula], or tfb  +  Δtoffset≃0.5 days for [formula]. These small values of [formula] days argue against the possibility for [formula] days presented in [\citet=Tchekhovskoy14_SwiftJ1644]. For this estimate we have idealized the entire light curve with one decay law. One could in theory fit a broken power law and obtain a more precise estimate, but given that fX, max is set by a flare during the first few days, only a rough estimate seems warranted.

Light curve dips

Clues about the physical nature of Swift J1644+57  may come from the difference in the spectral distribution of the radiation emitted by the source during the dips and outside them. Since dips are short and often drop more than an order of magnitude from the average emission level, we cannot obtain sufficient counts for detailed spectral analysis of individual dips. Instead, we must extract a single cumulative spectrum from many dips at a time. On the other hand, we cannot merge data from different operation modes. Therefore, we consider the following two different periods during which significantly deep dips are visible in the light curve of Swift J1644+57: (a) from T0+14.5 days to T0+39.5, with XRT steadily observing in WT mode and (b) from T0+40.5 days to T0+404.8 with XRT steadily observing in PC mode.

To select the dip good time intervals (GTIs), we developed a three step procedure that can be described as follows: (i) fit the light curve in a given time interval to a model and calculate the weighted residuals; (ii) remove all points with weighted residuals lower than a fixed negative threshold, then repeat the fit until no further points need to be removed; (iii) shift the best-fit model down by a proper amount and save as GTIs of the dips all the time intervals including only points below the shifted model. We developed this procedure in the IDL programming language and making use of the fit routines in the MPFIT package by [\citet=Markwardt09].

Step (ii) in our procedure gives us an alternative way to estimate the continuum underlying the light curve, though because of the large dispersion of the data the reduced χ2 of the fit is not expected to assume statistically acceptable values, and the uncertainties of the model parameters are expected to be substantially underestimated. The dips represent the points with the largest deviation from the continuum and they dominate the residuals: best-fit solutions obtained without removing any point have normalizations that make them lie significantly below the bulk of the data set. The iterative removal of points with negative residuals allows us to obtain solutions that actually pass through the most densely populated region of the curve. A threshold of - 5 for the weighted residuals has been chosen in order to obtain a good description of the flux light curve after 6 days, using a power-law model fX(t)  =  Nt- s with decay slope s fixed to the value of 1.48 estimated in Section [\ref=sec:lcfit]. In Figure [\ref=fig:lcfit], the model just described is represented by the black solid line in the upper panel, and the weighted residuals in the lower panel refer to it. They suggest that the true underlying continuum is reasonably well reproduced. An equivalent description of the continuum is provided by the dashed blue line in the upper panel, representing a best-fit solution obtained with a power-law model with initial time shifted by Δtoffset days before the BAT trigger ([formula]) and slope s fixed. However, the very same relation between s and Δtoffset already shown in Figure [\ref=fig:slope-offset] affects results obtained with this model. From these analyses we infer that -5 is a reasonable value for the threshold of rejection of points with negative residuals.

We applied our procedure to the count rate light curve of Swift J1644+57 computed in Section [\ref=sec:redu], separately for periods (a) (WT mode) and (b) (PC mode). We used a power-law model to fit the underlying continuum, and a threshold of -5 in step (ii). We obtained power-law decays with slopes 0.83  ±  0.08 for period (a) and 1.390  ±  0.005 for period (b), respectively. Finally, we shifted each power-law model down by decreasing its normalization by a quantity equal to 5 times the average percentage error of the light curve points in the corresponding period, and defined the GTIs of the dips in each period as in step (iii). We merged together successive time intervals containing only points below the cutting line whenever they were not separated by at least one point at a rate 10% larger than the cutting line. The final time selection, consisting of 98 GTIs (34 in WT mode and 64 in PC mode), is listed in Table 3. Figure [\ref=fig:cut] shows the separation between the "normal" and "dip" time intervals for the WT and PC mode data. Figure [\ref=fig:dips] shows a composite normalized light curve obtained by dividing each segment of the rate light curve by the corresponding cutting line. In this representation, the dips are the points below 1, and the depth of each dip is measured by the normalized rate level of its minimum, the inverse of which tells us by what factor the point is below the cutting line. In Figure [\ref=fig:dips] the dips' minima are marked with an empty star if the corresponding GTI is longer than 0.5 days, or with an empty circle if it is shorter. Note that the durations of our GTIs span from ~  190 s to ~  16.5 days, with 41 of them longer than 0.5 days and 57 shorter. Moreover, the short GTIs are all concentrated in the first 90 days and are not deeper than 0.2, with an average depth of ~  0.8, while the long GTIs are uniformly distributed, with depths in the range 0.87-  0.08 and average depth ~  0.36. It is likely that the absence of short GTIs after 90 days is a side-effect of the differential binning of the light curve, requiring longer time bins at later times, and average bin duration larger than 0.1 days after the first 100 days. If we define the dynamic range of a dip to be the ratio between the maximum count rate since the end of the preceding dip and the minimum count rate of the dip in question, we see that the short dips have a small dynamic range (between 1.1 and 6.3 with an average of 2.3), while the long dips have a much larger dynamic range (between 2 and 54 with an average of 10).

With the GTIs of the dips in Table 3 we have been able to extract cumulative "dip" and "normal" spectra for each observing period, and corresponding backgrounds. We fit the resulting four spectra with both an absorbed power-law and an absorbed log-parabola spectral model, and selected the best-fit model via an F-test as already done with time resolved spectra in Section [\ref=subsec:spectra]. The final best-fit parameter values are listed in Table 4, with corresponding confidence contours plotted in Figure [\ref=fig:contours]. The final spectral fits are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:spectra]. In both periods, the "dip" and "normal" spectra have the same shape (absorbed log-parabola for WT spectra in period (a), and absorbed power-law for PC spectra in period (b)) and the same level of absorption (i.e. consistent values of NH). The values of the photon indices though indicate that "dip" spectra are generally softer. This is in agreement with the harder-when-brighter correlation on short timescales described in Section [\ref=subsec:spectra]. Moreover, there is evidence for larger intrinsic NH  in PC (i.e. at later times) than in WT (only marginal for "dip" spectra), in agreement with the trends observed in the top panel of Figure [\ref=fig:param] and in the right panel of Figure [\ref=fig:ParvsFlux].

Discussion

We have calculated the definitive X-ray light curve of Swift J1644+57 in the 0.3-  10 keV band as observed by Swift/XRT in three years of follow-up and monitoring since the detection of the outburst.

The overall shape of the light curve consists of a set of initial spiky flares followed by an episode of steep decay underlying variability on shorter time scales from about 2 to 6 days after the BAT trigger (see Figure [\ref=fig:flux_lc], bottom panel), then a fast rebrightening by about an order of magnitude, and finally a long fading phase with a power-law like average decay abruptly ending on 2012 August 17, 507 days after the trigger. Without this sudden shut-off the source would have remained fairly bright for about 8-  10 years.

Despite several claims in the literature that the X-ray decay follows a t- 5 / 3 power law [\citep=Metzger12_SwiftJ1644] [\citep=Lei13_SwiftJ1644] [\citep=Kawashima13_SwiftJ1644] [\citep=Kumar13_SwiftJ1644] [\citep=Barniol13_SwiftJ1644] [\citep=Zauderer13_SwiftJ1644] [\citep=Shen14_SwiftJ1644] [\citep=Tchekhovskoy14_SwiftJ1644], we find that this is not the case. Our modeling of the flux light curve from 6.3 to 507 days after the trigger (performed in Section [\ref=sec:lcfit]) gives us an estimate of the decay slope of 1.48  ±  0.03 and shows that the data may be almost equivalently described with a slightly steeper slope when the decay start time is earlier than the BAT trigger by Δtoffset days, provided that Δtoffset is not larger than a few.

Model Interpretation

[\citet=Zauderer13_SwiftJ1644] argue that the rapid decline of the X-ray flux at t≃500 days heralded the turning off of the relativistic jet in Swift J1644+57. They suggest that at that time, the accretion rate within the jet feeding the BH dropped below the Eddington rate, [formula] [formula], assuming MBH≃106.5 [formula] and a conversion efficiency between rest-mass energy and accretion luminosity of εacc≃1. Prior to this time, the ratio of accretion power to jet power was constant, as evidenced by the constancy of the observed power law decay index. During the time it was seen by XRT, the X-ray luminosity of Swift J1644+57 varied over a dynamic range of about a factor of ~  6000, from ~  2.2  ×  1048 erg s- 1 to ~  3.7  ×  1044 erg s- 1. Thus if the switch-off luminosity corresponded to Eddington, at peak luminosity the accretion rate onto the BH would have been ~  6000 times Eddington.

If the conjecture by [\citet=Zauderer13_SwiftJ1644] is correct, one may obtain a constraint on the combination of efficiency parameters relating accretion rate to jet power. The jet power can be expressed as

[formula]

and the observed X-ray luminosity (assuming all the jet power is in X-rays) is

[formula]

where θJ is the jet opening angle. Hence,

[formula]

Assuming that the jet turns off when the accretion rate drops below Eddington, which happens at [formula] [formula] and LX,iso  =  3.7  ×  1044 erg s- 1, we obtain the constraint

[formula]

According to theory, it is not expected a priori for jet power to track accretion rate in the disk. If the jet is fed via the canonical Penrose-Blandford-Znajek process, the jet power would be

[formula]

where Φ* ,30 is the magnetic flux threading the BH event horizon in units of 1030 Gauss cm2, MBH,6 is the BH mass in units of 106 [formula], [formula] is the dimensionless angular frequency of the BH horizon, and f(ω) = 1 + 0.35ωH2 - 0.58ωH4 is a high spin correction [\citep=Tchekhovskoy10] [\citep=Tchekhovskoy14_SwiftJ1644]. For a spin parameter a = 0.9 this becomes

[formula]

[\citet=Tchekhovskoy14_SwiftJ1644] argue that in order for the jet power to track the accretion rate, there must exist a "magnetically-arrested" accretion disk (MAD), in which the magnetic flux threading the BH is determined by the ram pressure of the accretion flow. For such disks εJ≃1.3a2, where a is the dimensionless spin of the BH. For a nominal jet opening angle θJ≃0.1, our constraint εJθJ- 2 = 5.4 implies a spin a≃0.2 if [\citet=Tchekhovskoy14_SwiftJ1644] are correct. Also, the MAD state may be consistent with super-Eddington accretion.

At some point during the fallback of debris from the TDE an accretion disk is expected to form and to dominate the decay law, due to its slower inherent time scale enforced by an ever-expanding outer edge to the accretion disk [\citep=Cannizzo90] [\citep=Cannizzo11_SwiftJ1644]. [\citet=Cannizzo11_SwiftJ1644] argued that for Swift J1644+57 this transition occurred at t≃10 days, such that for t > 10 days the decay law would be flatter, [formula]. In this work we show that the best fit to the decay of Swift J1644+57 appears to be in line with s  =  1.5. Moreover, the quality of the fit is good; therefore [formula] appears to be excluded, as does the value [formula] expected from an advective disk. As a caveat on drawing any strong conclusions based on our putative slope s  =  1.5 for the unabsorbed flux light curve, we note that we are averaging over large amplitude variations in flux versus time. Although we utilize a multi-time step technique and average values in log Fx  -   log t space, it may be that our measured s value is not robust enough to warrant a detailed comparison with either of the two canonical theoretical s values. Our small inferred value for the fallback time [formula] day appears to rule out the large Δtoffset values that would be required to substantially increase s. The theoretical decay law [formula] [\citep=Kumar08] [\citep=Metzger08] [\citep=Metzger09] [\citep=Cannizzo09] is dependent on a super-Eddington disk and differs from the s = 19 / 16 expected from a standard thin disk [\citep=Cannizzo90]. This flatter decay (s≃1.19) can also be strongly excluded from our fit, and would not be expected anyway since [formula] for Swift J1644+57.

Two schools of thought have emerged concerning the fallback time tfb for Swift J1644+57. [\citet=Cannizzo11_SwiftJ1644] and [\citet=Gao12_SwiftJ1644] argue for [formula] day, which leads to the inference of a tidal disruption radius to periastron radius ratio RT / RP≃10 for the TDE, whereas [\citet=Tchekhovskoy14_SwiftJ1644] and [\citet=Shen14_SwiftJ1644] find RT / RP≃1. [\citet=Shen14_SwiftJ1644] also favor a BH mass MBH≃104 - 105 [formula], lower than most other groups. They advocate [formula] days and assume that the [formula] decay starts at ~  10 days, which is not consistent with our results. It is also important to note that [\citet=Tchekhovskoy14_SwiftJ1644] and [\citet=Shen14_SwiftJ1644] simply use the Swift J1644+57 data taken from the XRT website [\citep=Evans09] which assumes a single ECF (4.8  ×  10- 11 erg cm- 1 count- 1) and reports the observed flux, whereas we have used the time-dependent ECF for the unabsorbed flux, which is related to the intrinsic luminosity. As we show in Figure [\ref=fig:ECF], the unabsorbed flux ECF is about 9.6  ×  10- 11 erg cm- 1 count- 1, resulting in fluxes a factor of 2 higher than those obtained with the standard analysis; this affects the energetics, but not the derived decay slope s of the light curve.

An important caveat to the results of [\citet=Cannizzo11_SwiftJ1644] and [\citet=Gao12_SwiftJ1644] has emerged in the past few years, namely, these studies adopted a theoretical value for tfb from [\citet=Lacy82] and [\citet=Rees88] that derives from relating the spread in specific orbital energy of the debris streams to conditions at periastron, Δε≃GMBHR*RP- 2. However, recent work has shown that this viewpoint is not correct: the stellar shredding by the tidal force is in fact so effective that by the time the star arrives at periastron, its shredded fragments are traveling on ballistic trajectories; therefore the relevant radius in determining Δε and thus tfb is not the periastron radius RP, but rather the disruption radius RT [\citep=Guillochon13] [\citep=Stone13]. This leads to smaller Δε and larger tfb. However, the more recent studies do not consider strong general relativistic effects under the Kerr metric, which would become relevant if an orbit were deeply plunging such that RP were to lie within the ergosphere of a nearly maximal spin BH. It is conceivable tfb could be shortened dramatically. Support for this idea may be given by a recent study by [\citet=Evans15] which presents a new class of TDEs showing prompt formation of an accretion torus and hyperaccretion. These TDEs involve ultra-close encounters (RT  /  RP≃10) and high spin BHs. They find a strong influence of general relativistic effects. A caveat to their work is that their large Δε values may be an artifact of under-resolving the midplane compression of the star.

In any event, the observational inference on the fallback time we derive in this work, [formula] days, is based on two observables, the peak X-ray flux and the total X-ray fluence, and is therefore not subject to the theoretical uncertainties inherent in the aforementioned works. [\citet=Krimm2011] note apparent activity in Swift J1644+57 on 2011 March 25, [formula] days before the 2011 March 28 Swift/BAT trigger. This interval of time exceeds our nominal tfb estimate. The signal-to-noise (S/N for the 2011 March 25 was low, [formula] (0.0059  ±  0.0016 ct s- 1 cm- 2), but the positional coincidence with the larger trigger three days later, S/N= 7.6σ, gives strength to the detection. A prior close encounter of the star that became disrupted may have led to a partial disruption, such that an extended train of debris arrived near the BH prior to the main TDE, leading to a weak precursor.

Residual X-ray Emission and Future Evolution

Swift J1644+57 is still detected at the flux level of (1.0±   0.8)×  10- 14 erg cm- 2 s- 1 (0.3-  10 keV, observed flux) over an integrated exposure of ~  200 ks accumulated in ~  500 days of weekly XRT monitoring. The Chandra-ACIS ToO observation performed on 2012 November 26, ~  3 months after the XRT drop, also detected Swift J1644+57 with 2.8σ significance. A detailed analysis of the observation is reported in [\citet=Zauderer13_SwiftJ1644]. We reproduced their results and estimated a 0.3-  10 keV unabsorbed flux of (7±  3)×  10- 15 erg cm- 2 s- 1, consistent with the final Swift/XRT data point (see Figure [\ref=fig:flux_lc]). This flux value is obtained with the average late XRT spectral parameters estimated and used by [\citep=Zauderer13_SwiftJ1644]: [formula] fixed to 1.7×  1020 cm- 2, intrinsic NH~  1.4  ×  1022 cm- 2, and Γ  ~  1.3. A fit with NH fixed to 1.9×  1022 cm- 2 gives Γ  =  2.1+ 1.7- 1.4 (consistent with the spectrum of our XRT last point presented in Section [\ref=subsec:spectra]) and an unabsorbed 0.3-  10 keV flux of (8±  3)×  10- 15 erg cm- 2 s- 1. In the second observation performed by Chandra on 2015 February 17 (day 1421 after the BAT trigger), Swift J1644+57 is still detected with 5σ significance and net count rate of (4.2±  1.2)×  10- 4 counts s- 1 in the 0.5-  8 keV range. We modeled the spectrum with an absorbed power-law model as we already did with previous data. Fixing [formula] to 1.7 ×  1020 cm- 2, and intrinsic NH to ~  1.4  ×  1022 cm- 2 we obtain Γ  =  0.6  ±  1.2, χ2r  =  0.906 (10 dof), while NH fixed to 1.9×  1022 cm- 2 gives Γ  =  0.74  ±  1.2, χ2r  =  0.932 (10 dof). The unabsorbed flux in the (0.3-  10) keV band is equal to (1.7+ 0.4- 1.0)  ×  10- 14 erg cm- 2 s- 1. The 2015 Chandra spectrum seems to be harder than both the Swift-post drop spectrum and the Chandra 2012 spectrum, though given the large uncertainties on the photon indices the statistical significance is marginal. Moreover, this 2015 detection is still consistent with the final Swift/XRT data point (see Figure [\ref=fig:flux_lc]).

The residual emission detected by Chandra and Swift  is not consistent with thermal emission from the fall-back accretion disk. For MBH in the 5×  106  -  107 [formula] range, the disk is expected to have a temperature at the inner radius in the ~  20-  25 eV range if jet shut-off occurred at a critical accretion rate [formula], or in the ~  12-  15 eV range if the critical accretion rate was ~  0.1 [formula]. By using the diskbb model in xspec with true inner radius ~  6 G MBH/c2, face-on disk, and redshift effects properly taken in account, we predict a 0.3-  10 keV flux always <   10- 16 erg cm- 2 s- 1, and a bolometric disk luminosity Ldisk in the 5×  1043  -  1045 erg s- 1 range. By using the standard spectral model for Comptonized X-ray emission from an AGN corona described in [\cite=Ghisellini09], which consists of a power-law with photon index ~    -  1, a high energy exponential cut-off with folding energy of ~  150 keV, and total X-ray luminosity ~  0.3 Ldisk, we can easily calculate that the observed 0.3-  10 keV flux could be obtained as a result of Comptonization of the disk UV photons by a hot corona for an L[formula]1044 erg s- 1. However, fine tuning of a number of unmeasurable parameters is required to achieve this result, and this makes the interpretation of residual X-ray emission from Swift J1644+57 as Comptonized emission unlikely, though we cannot rule out contributions from Comptonization effects.

An alternate interpretation is that the residual X-ray emission detected by Chandra and Swift after jet shut-off originates from the forward shock of the jet still expanding in the ambient medium. In fact, [\citet=Zauderer13_SwiftJ1644] calculate that the low X-ray flux measured by Chandra  is consistent with synchrotron emission from the forward shock of a structured jet with time-dependent physical parameters derived by modeling the radio spectra of Swift J1644+57, which they regularly monitored for about 600 days after the outburst. In this scenario we expect the X-ray emission to go on decaying with time as the radio emission. An extrapolation of the 2012 Chandra-ACIS flux to 2015 can be done assuming no spectral variation with time (as guaranteed by the extrapolated value of the cooling frequency based on [\citet=Zauderer13_SwiftJ1644] results still being in the NIR band), and a flux decay rate [formula] with α  ~  (2 - 3p) / 4, where p is the slope of the energy distribution of the electrons accelerated at the shock [\citep=Granot02]. For a typical value of p  ~  2.2 - 2.6, we expect α in the 1.15  -  1.45 range. Then, an unabsorbed flux lower than ~  (2.6  ±  1)  ×  10- 15 erg cm- 2 s- 1 in the 0.3 - 10 keV band was expected in February 2015. The 2015 Chandra detection clearly shows that the X-ray flux has not decayed according to this prediction. Unfortunately, we have no simultaneous information on radio emission level from Swift J1644+57 and we cannot tell if the two bands are really evolving in an independent way. Only a coordinated X-ray and radio monitoring will be able to answer this question.

A distinctive signature of the two possible scenarios for the origin of residual X-ray emission, i.e. disk/corona related Comptonized emission and forward shock related synchrotron emission, may be the photon index of the X-ray spectrum Γ. In the former case, Γ is expected to lie in the 1.5  -  2.2 range: values much lower than 1.5 correspond to nonphysical Compton y parameters in standard inverse-Compton scattering scenarios for modeling the X-ray power-law emission from the corona [\citep=Zdziarski_1990]; values much larger than 2.2 are observationally unlikely based on detailed X-ray spectral analysis of the non-beamed AGNs [\citep=Corral_2011] [\citep=Vasudevan_2013]. In the latter case, since the [\citet=Zauderer13_SwiftJ1644] analysis shows that the cooling frequency of the shocked electrons was and is likely still expected to be in the infrared band, the spectral slope in X-rays should be [formula], and for a typical value of p  ~  2.2 - 2.6, we expect Γ  ~  2.1 - 2.3 [\citep=Granot02]. Unfortunately, none of our Swift or Chandra X-ray spectra has enough statistics to unambiguously constrain the photon index. Even our indication in favor of a Γ  >  2 given by the measure of the XRT band ratio after the shut-off (see Section [\ref=subsec:hr_lc]) does not allow us to decide between the two cases.

[\citet=Krolik11_SwiftJ1644] and [\citet=Bloom11_SwiftJ1644] point out that the variability time-scales observed in Swift J1644+57  are orders of magnitude shorter than those found in the relativistic jets of blazars, which presumably have a similar mechanism [\citep=BZ77]. [\citet=Tchekhovskoy14_SwiftJ1644] provide a model that seems able to account for all of the behavior seen in the X-ray light curve of Swift J1644+57, including both the initial rapid and strong variability in 2011 March as well as the sudden shut-off in 2012 August. The uncertainty regarding the long term evolution of the whole system after jet shut-off, the nature and timescales of possible future disk transitions and their observable signatures are related to the uncertainty in the physics of disk accretion and to the detailed accretion disk models adopted by different authors. According to [\cite=Tchekhovskoy14_SwiftJ1644] a reactivation of the jet may occur due to a further transition of the disk to the Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF) stage expected for [formula] [formula] 0.01 [formula]. This phenomenon is expected in analogy to state transitions from high/soft to low/hard emission observed in Galactic microquasars, and observationally associated with a jet revival [\citep=Fender04]. The jet reactivation, predicted to occur sometime between 2016 and 2022 at an X-ray flux level of ~  10- 14 - 10- 13 erg cm- 2 s- 1 (depending on MBH and the type and the disrupted fraction of the passing star), is expected to be observable for months. The new X-ray bright stage of Swift J1644+57 will likely be detectable by Chandra through all the reactivation period, and possibly even by Swift. In the final analysis, such questions will be decided by observations, and to this end Swift continues to observe Swift J1644+57 regularly, watching for another flare-up of this fascinating object.

Spectral Analysis and Dips

We have shown that the shape and the variability timescales in the X-ray light curve of Swift J1644+57 are unlike other known sources with relativistic jets along the line of sight. The spectral behavior of Swift J1644+57 is peculiar as well. For the first several days the source seems to follow a pure harder-when-brighter correlation similar to that observed in blazars, but the later time analysis we have done can be better explained in terms of a superposition of a slow hardening of the spectra along with the global light curve decay, and a harder-when-brighter correlation tracking variability at shorter timescales. The typical harder-when-brighter behavior in blazar flares can be explained in terms of the blazar spectral model [\citep=Celotti08] by a rise of the External Compton (EC) component with the accretion rate, associated with an independent different evolution of the Synchrotron Self Compton (SSC) component. It has also been observed that the slope of the correlation between the photon index and the 2-  10 keV flux can be different from flare to flare, and can even disappear [\citep=Vercellone11]. This may happen when the SCC and EC components increase proportionally with the accretion rate but maintain balance, so that luminosity rises achromatically.

[\citetalias=Burrows11_SwiftJ1644] successfully explained the early broadband spectra of Swift J1644+57 with a blazar-like spectral model, but no EC component was required by our data. The stringent VERITAS and Fermi upper limits on gamma-ray emission even required a suppression of the Self Compton peak of the spectrum through pair production. The EC component in blazars can be produced by seed photons from the Broad Line Region (BLR) and/or seed photons from the accretion disk interacting with the relativistic electrons in the jet. Actually, it is very unlikely that a BLR had time enough to form in the case of Swift J1644+57, but it is still possible that EC from disk photons contributes to the soft X-ray emission of Swift J1644+57, though the component peak, expected at very high energies, must be highly suppressed. On the other hand, [\citetalias=Burrows11_SwiftJ1644] (e.g. Supplementary Figure 15) showed that both the XRT spectrum extracted at the light curve minimum 4.5 days post-trigger and the later intermediate level spectrum extracted at 8 days post-trigger have an upward kink at higher energies that suggest the presence of an unknown additional hard spectral component, the peak of which they could not constrain. This is also the case for all our XRT spectra fit by a concave log-parabola model. This unknown hard component may play a role similar to the low energy tail of the EC in determining the spectral evolution of Swift J1644+57 in X-rays.

The softness of the average emission of the dips compared to the inter-dip normal emission, without NH variation, agrees with a production mechanism based on a larger contribution of a hard spectral component at larger accretion rate/luminosity. The apparent randomness in temporal distribution, duration, and depths of the dips, as well as in height, duration, and structure of the flares occurring between dips, suggest they originate from random fluctuations in the accretion rate, i.e. instabilities in the accretion flow, like in blazars. However, dynamic range and duty cycle of dips and flares in Swift J1644+57 are extreme compared to blazars, and are difficult to reproduce in this model. [\citet=Krolik11_SwiftJ1644] suggest that the required extremely compact and short-lived inhomogeneities (i.e. "knots") in the accretion flow, can be obtained if the tidally disrupted star is a white dwarf and the tidal disruption goes on taking away fragments of it at each periastron passage until it is consumed. However, only a central BH mass of ~  104 M[formula] would fit the observed timescales, which is not consistent with results from our analysis of the global decay of the Swift J1644+57  light curve. An alternative mechamism based on random internal shocks propagating along the jet channel has been proposed by [\citet=DeColle12]. Based on a hint of possible periodic modulation of the dips, [\citet=Saxton12] proposed they may be due to combined effects of precession and nutation that cause the core of the jet briefly to go out of the line of sight.

Conclusions

We present the definitive Swift/XRT light curve for Swift J1644+57, which spans ~  800 days. We find that the ECF varies over time due to spectral evolution. Most previous studies of the long term Swift J1644+57  relied on a single ECF for the entire light curve. The peak flux, at (t - T0)  =  1.3 days, was [formula] erg cm- 2 s- 1, and the fluence over the entire light curve was [formula] erg cm- 2. With the standard cosmology, a redshift z = 0.354 yields peak luminosity and total energy values of [formula] erg s- 1 and [formula] erg, respectively. From the ratio of these numbers we determine an observationally based value for the fallback time for debris following the TDE of [formula] days. By fitting the decay slope for 6 days <  t  <   508 days for six logarithmic binnings in log Δt we determine a post-fluctuation decay slope s = 1.48  ±  0.03. This is statistically distinguishable from the [formula] value for Swift J1644+57  commonly cited in the literature, and also from the [formula] value advocated by [\citet=Cannizzo11_SwiftJ1644] and [\citet=Gao12_SwiftJ1644] wherein one has a rapid transition from stellar fallback to highly advective disk accretion. Given the large fluctuations in X-ray flux with time, it may be difficult even with our multi-time step averaging technique to reliably extract a physically meaningful slope which bears comparison to theory. Previous studies quoting a slope did not carry out detailed fitting but simply overlay a [formula] decay onto log fX  -   log t light curve for Swift J1644+57 taken from the Swift/XRT website, which assumes a single ECF value.

Our small inferred tfb supports the viewpoint of a rapid transition from stellar fallback to disk accretion [\citep=Cannizzo11_SwiftJ1644] [\citep=Gao12_SwiftJ1644] but the value of s  ≈  1.5 does not. A value [formula] 1 day challenges current theory, which favors tfb≃20 - 30 days, but does not consider strong general relativistic effects in the Kerr metric for large RT / RP encounters; modifications in the binding energy spread Δε for the tidal debris from the standard results for RT / RP≃1 encounters are treated via linear perturbations to a Newtonian gravitational potential [\citep=Guillochon13] [\citep=Stone13].

For completeness we note that several recent works have addressed the issue of the fate of the shredded gas following the TDE [\citep=Hayasaki13] [\citep=Hayasaki15] [\citep=Shiokawa15] [\citep=Bonnerot15] [\citep=Guillochon15]. [\citet=Shiokawa15] consider the RT / RP = 1 tidal disruption of a 0.64 [formula] WD by a 500 [formula]  Schwarzschild BH utilizing a general relativistic hydrodynamic simulation (excluding magnetic fields). They find deflection of mass by shocks to be an important effect. The peak accretion rate is lowered by about a factor of ten compared to previous estimates and the duration of the peak is enhanced by about a factor of five. [\citet=Bonnerot15] investigate RT / RP = 1 and RT / RP = 5 tidal disruptions of a 1 [formula] star by a 106 [formula] Schwarzschild BH using an SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) code. They find that circulation of debris is driven by relativistic apsidal precession (which causes the leading part of the stream to collide with the trailing part that is still falling back toward the BH). They consider two cooling efficiencies, isothermal and adiabatic equations of state. [\citet=Guillochon15] carry out simplified Monte Carlo realizations of tidal disruption streams to determine their structure prior to circularization. They find that for SMBHs with [formula] the stream self-intersection happens after the most bound debris has wound around periapse many times, and thus one expects the accretion rate onto the BH to be delayed with respect to the fallback rate, [formula]. This delay would occur in addition to the one posited by [\citet=Tchekhovskoy14_SwiftJ1644] by considering magnetic flux build-up near the BH. The results of [\citet=Guillochon15] are particularly interesting in light of our observational result [formula] day and indicate that additional physical effects may be required to address the unique aspects of Swift J1644+57.

We cannot favor an interpretation of the late time low-level X-ray emission by Chandra and Swift as being consistent with emission from the forward shock of a structured jet because the second Chandra observation performed at the beginning of 2015 shows that the X-ray flux has not decayed as expected in this scenario from an extrapolation of the radio decay trend. However, further coordinated X-ray and radio monitoring of the source is needed to rule out the suggested common origin of the residual X-rays and the radio emission. The low-level X-ray emission is not consistent with thermal emission from the fallback accretion disk expected at these late times, but maybe reconciled with a scenario including Comptonized emission from a hot corona.

The spectral variability of Swift J1644+57 in X-rays can be described by an irregular harder-when-brighter behavior tracking flares and dips, with a long term hardening trend associated with the decay phase. The harder-when-brighter behavior may arise from the interplay between the synchrotron spectral component and Comptonized radiation from the accretion disk. Our study of the duration, depth and dynamic range of the dips in the time interval from ~  14 to ~  405 days post-trigger confirm extreme variability of Swift J1644+57 throughout all the decay phase of the light curve.
