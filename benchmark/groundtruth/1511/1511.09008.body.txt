Introduction

The almost perfect cosmos reported by the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) analyses of the Planck mission comprises potential departures from isotropic and/or Gaussian statistics. These "anomalies" typically correspond to large angular scales, and their significance is subject to active research [\citep=Schwarz2015]. One of these ripples is the Cold Spot (CS) that is an exceptionally cold area centered on [formula] Galactic coordinates. It was first detected in the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe [\citep=bennett2012] maps at ≃2 - 3σ significance using wavelet filtering [\citep=VielvaEtal2003] [\citep=CruzEtal2004], and its presence was later confirmed by Planck [\citep=Planck23]. However, [\cite=ZhangHuterer2010] and [\cite=Nadathur2014] have found that the most anomalous nature of the CS is in fact not its coldness at its center, but rather the hot ring feature that surrounds it.

Proposals for the physical origin of the CS include rather exotic physics, e.g., textures [\citep=CruzEtal2008] [\citep=Vielva2010], and combinations of the linear Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) [\citep=SachsWolfe] and non-linear Rees-Sciama (RS) effects [\citep=ReesSciama] from a deep [formula] Mpc/h supervoid centred on the CS [\citep=InoueSilk2006] [\citep=InoueSilk2007] [\citep=InoueEtal2010], as a possible manifestation of Dark Energy's dominance at low redshifts. Such a deep void has not been found in large-scale structure analyses of the area, but there is firm evidence for a large but shallow supervoid in constellation Eridanus [\citep=SzapudiEtAl2014] [\citep=FinelliEtal2014]. Congruently, a low-redshift supervoid of δ0  ≈   - 0.25 and r0  ≈  200 Mpc/h is capable of producing a ΔTISW  ≈   - 20μK imprint in the CMB with dissimilar angular profile assuming spherical shape and concordance ΛCDM cosmology [\citep=FinelliEtal2014] [\citep=Nadathur2014] [\citep=Zibin2014] [\citep=MarcosCaballero2015] [\citep=SzapudiEtAl2014].

Although no supervoid has been found that could fully account for the CS decrement, there is independent statistical evidence that super-structures imprint on the CMB as cold and hot spots [\citep=GranettEtal2008] [\citep=Planck23] [\citep=CaiEtal2013]. The imprinted temperature in all of these studies is significantly colder for voids than simple estimates from linear ISW would suggest, therefore potentially represent a unique choice to learn about Dark Energy [\citep=RudnickEtal2007] [\citep=PapaiSzapudi2010] [\citep=PapaiEtal2011] [\citep=Flender2013] [\citep=Hotchkiss2015]. The presence of this apparent excess ISW-like signal from supervoids and superclusters have generated debate about its physical origin in favor of a rare statistical fluke [\citep=Nadathur2012] [\citep=HM2013] [\citep=Aiola2015]. A possible way out of this situation is the consideration of elongated void models [\citep=Flender2013] and studies of potential biases in how void finder algorithms perform when applied to photometric redshift data [\citep=Kovacs2015].

In fact, [\cite=Granett2015] estimated the ellipticity of the 50 [\cite=GranettEtal2008] supervoids, identified by the ZOBOV [\citep=ZOBOV] algorithm, and found an average line-of-sight (LOS, hereafter) elongation of q = 2.6  ±  0.4. This finding qualitatively explains why the ISW signal in the direction of supervoids appears to be significantly colder than theoretical predictions based on ISW analyses of ZOBOV-voids found in N-body simulations, where on average a spherical shape was assumed for the most significant objects, without modeling photometric redshift errors.

Likewise, [\cite=MarcosCaballero2015] estimated the effects of ellipticity on the ISW pattern imprinted by the Eridanus supervoid, and found colder central imprints with unsatisfactory angular profiles. In this paper, we find evidences for extreme elongation of the Eridanus supervoid, and argue that the prolate shape of the supervoid might shed new light on this outstanding problem.

Observations

On the observational ground, the extra deepening in the central [formula] galaxy counts in Ref. [\cite=SzapudiEtAl2014] suggests that the void might be slightly deeper in its center than the first estimate. Moreover, the lack of data at the lowest redshifts and the limited sky coverage of the PS1 photo-z catalogue at the CS resulted in significant uncertainties and possible biases in the estimation of the total extent of the Eridanus supervoid.

We demonstrate that photometric redshifts of better quality and available spectroscopic measurements at the lowest redshifts reveal important details about the angular and radial shape of the Eridanus supervoid, and its surroundings. We further analyze the neighborhood of the Eridanus supervoid by looking at the density field in the antipodal direction on the sky that is physically close to the low-z part of the supervoid. This continuation of the LOS that we use for analyzing the direction of the CS happens to traverse the region that is called the Northern Local Supervoid, indicating that the Eridanus supervoid and its gravitational potential has connections and influence on the antipodal part of the sky. We find that this antipodal region includes the very rich Corona Borealis supercluster (CBS) that is perhaps the most massive member of the Sloan Great Wall [\citep=Gott2005]. The CBS is located in the intersection of the SGW and another chain of superclusters [\citep=Einasto2011] which includes e.g. the Hercules supercluster in the Coma Great Wall [\citep=Geller1989].

Note that the existence of the Sloan Great Wall is difficult to reconcile with the standard model [\citep=Sheth2011], and similarly the Eridanus supervoid is a rare object in the local Universe [\citep=Sahlen2015].

A final piece of evidence for the potential connection between local supervoids and region of the Great Walls is the existence of the Draco supervoid in the Northern hemisphere, as noticed in [\cite=FinelliEtal2014]. We show that this other large-angle underdensity in the volume traced by the WISE-2MASS survey is the neighboring structure of the Great Wall system from another side.

Modeling

We follow [\cite=FinelliEtal2014] in order to calculate the ISW and RS effects of supervoids, and model their profiles as a Gaussian LTB profile with parameter α = 0,

[formula]

which corresponds to a density contrast:

[formula]

giving rise to a compensated void, with g(a) the density contrast growth function of ΛCDM, and

[formula]

On the other hand, the ISW and RS angular temperature profiles, for a spherical void, are given by

[formula]

in the small angle approximation, and

[formula]

where [formula],   [formula] and ζi(z) are given by [\cite=FinelliEtal2014]. Note that the RS effect is always subdominant compared to the ISW contribution.

In this framework, a rather extreme model supervoid of δ0  =   - 0.3 and of radius r0 = 360 Mpc/h can leave a central imprint as cold as the central CS temperature (Fig. 1). However, matching the angular extent of the CS is only possible with a rather narrow void of angular size [formula] which requires extreme ellipticity, or the interpretation that a long but fully connected tunnel of voids, with the most significant overlap in its central region, might exist in the local Universe.

See Fig. 1 for a comparison of central ΔTISW imprints of spherical model supervoids that have been proposed as explanations for the CS. Medium blue contours indicate the range - 150  ±  10μK, where a hypothetical low-z void, capable of explaining the CS central temperature, should be located. The angular profile of the CS, however, cannot be reproduced with these spherical model supervoids [\citep=Nadathur2014].

The possible locus of an even more extreme supervoid capable of imprinting [formula] into the CMB, to possibly explain the hot ring as a combination of a positive primordial signal (or a positive ISW imprint of large neighboring superclusters), plus an extremely cold and narrow ISW+RS imprint, is shown with the dark blue contour. Note that the probability of spherical underdensities of this size is extremely low in the ΛCDM cosmological model [\citep=Nadathur2014], but very little is known about the actual shape of the largest negative fluctuations, that surround the largest superclusters often with multi-spider morphology [\citep=Einasto2011]. We seek large-scale structure evidence for such a peculiar supervoid, or system of fully connected voids.

The paper is organized as follows. Data sets and map making algorithms are described in Section 2; our observational results are presented in Section 3; the final section 4 contains a summary, discussion and interpretation of our results.

Data sets

Planck

For Planck CMB temperature data we use the Spectral Matching Independent Component Analysis (SMICA) [\citep=CardosoEtal2008] [\citep=Planck2015I] map downgraded to HEALPIX [\citep=healpix] resolution Nside = 128. We use a definition for the center of the CS from the latest Planck results [\citep=Planck24] [\citep=Planck2015XVI]. Based on the literature, we decided in advance to test for an underdensity at [formula] around this center to match the approximate angular size of the CS [\citep=VielvaEtal2003] [\citep=CruzEtal2004] [\citep=RudnickEtal2007] [\citep=SzapudiEtAl2014]. We minimize the a posteriori bias by setting this value from CMB independently of the large-scale structure data we use, and this choice also simplifies the interpretation of our measurements in the Bayesian framework.

Previous galaxy surveys at the Cold Spot

[\cite=RudnickEtal2007] have found the first evidences for an underdensity by studying a catalog of radio galaxies in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). However, no redshift information was available for the supervoid candidate, and its significance has been disputed [\citep=SmithHuterer2010]. Targeted pencil beam surveys [\cite=GranettEtal2010] and [\cite=BremerEtal2010] found no significant underdensity between redshifts of 0.5  <  z  <  0.9, but their data are consistent with a void at z  <  0.3. In addition, the analysis of the 2-Micron All-Sky Survey Extended Source Catalog [\citep=jarrett2000] galaxy distribution by [\cite=francis2010] showed a shallow underdensity of large angular size around the CS. [\cite=rassat2013] confirmed the presence of this low-z void in the reconstructed 2MASS ISW maps. The ISW imprint is consistent with ΔTISW  ≈   - 50μK at the CS (the most significant imprint in the observable sky), if all multipoles [formula] are taken into account for a joint 2MASS-NVSS ISW reconstruction [\citep=Rassat2014].

Recently, [\cite=FinelliEtal2014] identified a similarly large underdensity in the WISE-2MASS galaxy catalogue by [\cite=KovacsSzapudi2014] that combines measurements of two all-sky surveys in the infrared, the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer [\citep=wise]) and the Point Source Catalog of the 2-Micron All-Sky Survey [\citep=2mass]. [\cite=SzapudiEtAl2014] matched the WISE-2MASS galaxy map to a 1,300 deg2 area with the PV1.2 reprocessing of Pan-STARRS1 [\citep=ps1ref], adding optical colours for each object. In the resulting catalog with photometric redshifts [\cite=SzapudiEtAl2014] analyzed the LOS density profile in the redshift range z  <  0.3, and detected a supervoid of radius r0=220 Mpc/h centered on the CS.

Importantly, [\cite=Manzotti2014] found that any late time ISW+RS imprints that might be responsible for the Cold Spot are very likely to be originated at z  <  0.3, thus the most detailed examination of this region is requisite.

See Table 1 for a detailed comparison of current and previous galaxy samples used for mapping the CS region, including the Dark Energy Survey [\citep=DES]. DES has started its observations in the region of interest, and will presumably provide important details about the Eridanus supervoid by mapping the density field traced by the redMaGiC selection of luminous red galaxies with accurate photometric redshifts [\citep=Rozo2015].

2MASS photometric redshift catalogue

We extend the previous analyses of the CS region by using the 2MASS Photometric redshift catalogue [\citep=Bilicki2014], i.e. a low-redshift photo-z map for almost the full sky, powered by a WISE-2MASS-SuperCOSMOS matched catalog containing infrared colors W1wise, W2wise, J2mass, H2mass, K2mass, and optical photometry Bsc, Rsc, and Isc [\citep=supercosmos]. The parent sample of 2MPZ is the 2MASS XSC that includes [formula] resolved sources detected on most of the sky except the highly confused Galactic bulge.

The 2MPZ catalog contains more accurate photometric redshifts than those of [\cite=b14] who created a similar catalog without WISE observations. The accuracy reached in the photo-z estimation process with ANNz algorithms is σz  ≈  0.015, or 12% on average. The redshift distribution of the 2MPZ catalog is shown in Fig. 2. The smoothed full sky distribution of the 2MPZ galaxies is presented in the middle panels Fig. 3.

We mask pixels with E(B - V)  ≥  0.1 [\citep=SchlegelEtal1998], and regions at galactic latitudes [formula] to exclude potentially contaminated regions near the Galactic plane, and the Magellanic Clouds. A stripe at [formula], [formula] with a lack of WISE measurements due to torque rod gashes or incompleteness in WISE due to moon contamination was also masked out, following [\cite=Bilicki2014]. For the linear bias parameter that we consider in our following analysis, we use the value of [formula] for z < 0.08 and [formula] for z > 0.08, as estimated by [\cite=Alonso2015].

6dF Galaxy Survey

For the mapping of the CS region at the lowest redshifts, we use the 6dF Galaxy Survey Data Release 3 (DR3) galaxy catalogue [\citep=Jones2009] that is a near-infrared selected redshift survey covering 17,000 deg 2 in the Southern sky. The near-infrared photometric selection was based on the 2MASS XSC, while the spectroscopic redshifts of 6dFGS were obtained with the Six-Degree Field (6dF) multi-object spectrograph of the UK Schmidt Telescope (UKST).

The survey avoids a [formula] region around the Galactic plane to minimize extinction and foregrounds. For our density field analysis, we use the mask constructed for the 2MPZ sample supplemented by an extra cut at [formula] due to the 6dF survey boundary.

For this galaxy catalogue, we consider a linear galaxy bias parameter of [formula] as measured by [\cite=Beutler2012]. In Fig. 2, we compare the redshift distribution of the 6dF catalogue to those of 2MPZ and WISE-2MASS-PS1.

Super-structure catalogues

We consider three catalogues of low redshift voids in order to complement the information in the galaxy catalogues with existing knowledge on local underdensities. Void positions, approximate size information, and their relation to nearby superclusters are really informative additional tools to confirm our findings below.

void catalogue by [\cite=Batuski1985] (B&B) that contains 29 voids defined by the absence of Abell clusters.

a similar compilation of cluster-defined voids appears in [\cite=Einasto1994] (EEDTA), i.e. a census listing a total of 27 supervoids within a cube of 740 Mpc a side.

we consider voids in the Eridanus constellation defined by spec-z tracer galaxies of the Southern Sky Redshift Survey 2 (SSRS2) [\citep=ElAd1997].

Results

Tomography

We first perform a tomographic imaging in the wider CS area of [formula] using 2MPZ and 6dF data. The resulting maps, spanning z < 0.3 in eight redshift slices of different width, are shown in Fig. 3. We note the following features in this analysis:

the LOS we analyze passes by the Eridanus group and the Fornax cluster in the lowest bin at z < 0.02, but the wider CS region is underdense.

at 0.02 < z < 0.04 the 6dF data shows that the CS LOS avoids other overdensities in the very nearby Universe.

the CS region slightly overlaps with one of the outer filamentary arms of the Horologium supercluster.

at 0.08 < z  <  0.11, now traced by 2MPZ photo-zs, the Horologium supercluster is still visible in the bottom of the image, while the CS LOS traverses the center of an extended system of underdensities with deeper subvoids.

the large-scale underdensity is followed by a set of typical realizations of over- and underdensities of smaller angular size, but the CS area is still underdense.

at 0.15 < z < 0.20, a deep, extended, and slightly miscentered void is observable, surrounded by presumably prominent superclusters.

the last photo-z bin, where 2MPZ starts running out of data, again shows that the CS area passes through the center of an extended underdensity.

The topographic maps qualitatively indicate that the LOS of the CS happens to be underdense almost all the way out to [formula]. In other words, the CS region is avoided by prominent and rich superclusters, but is not necessarily the deepest underdensity in the maps.

This claim disagrees with the conclusions by [\cite=SzapudiEtAl2014] who found that there is no underdensity in the CS region at z < 0.1. Again qualitatively, we now see that the limited PS1 photo-z coverage, marked in the tomographic images, is inappropriate for detecting extended underdensities because there is no contrast with respect to the background they use for estimating the mean galaxy density.

Line-of-sight density profile

Following [\cite=SzapudiEtAl2014], we continue with the measurement of mean matter densities δm  =  δg / bg (corrected for linear galaxy bias) at different distances in the direction of the CS in a disk of [formula] around the center.

We show both 6dF and 2MPZ results at redshifts z < 0.08 where the constraining power of the more accurate 6dF spec-z data is adequate. The right side of Fig. 4 shows that the deepest part of the supervoid is located close to [formula], thus closer to us than reported by [\cite=SzapudiEtAl2014]. More importantly, the supervoid appears to extend towards the lowest redshifts, again in disagreement with [\cite=SzapudiEtAl2014]. We interpret these differences as an imperfection in the PS1 photo-z analysis due to small survey area, and the worse sampling in the WISE-2MASS-PS1 catalogue at the lowest redshifts. Note, however, that the PS1 measurements (data points and error bars taken from Figure 4 in [\cite=SzapudiEtAl2014]) are consistent with 2MPZ within 1σ errors.

The ability of resolving relatively small-scale structures with 6dF spec-zs and the high-quality photo-zs from 2MPZ allow us to notice the following details in our analysis, in agreement with the tomography:

the CS lies close to the Fornax cluster region (z < 0.02).

the Horologium supercluster's filament in its outskirts results in an short overdense part along the LOS.

there are several known and catalogued voids in between these two low-z overdensities, resulting in an extra deepening in the 6dF counts compared to 2MPZ at 0.02 < z < 0.06.

the last 6dF bin is in great agreement with the 2MPZ bin of similar size, meaning that the two catalogues with different biases trace similarly the underlying dark matter field.

similar coherence is observable for PS1 and 2MPZ for the less accurately sampled bins at 0.15 < z < 0.20 and 0.20 < z < 0.30.

In Fig. 4, we show supervoid models of δ0  =   - 0.3, r0 = 360 Mpc/h and δ0  =   - 0.25, r0 = 440 Mpc/h together with the matter density measurements. We then perform a χ2 analysis using the 2MPZ data points and the 0.3 < z < 0.5 measurement by [\cite=GranettEtal2010]. We assume a diagonal covariance matrix thus no correlation between the different photo-z bins which is a defendable approximation given the width of the bins and the relatively low photo-z uncertainties in 2MPZ. The χ2 plane shown in Fig. 5 is estimated for the parameter space explored in Fig. 1 (d.o.f. = 6+1-2). The same supervoid candidates, and contours for the ΔTISW + RS imprint of voids are shown on top of the consistency measure of the LSS data and LOS model profiles.

We find that previous model voids are barely consistent with the region of lower χ2 values ([formula]). On the contrary, the model supervoids we proposed as theoretical possibilities to explain the central CMB depression at the CS, or the depression and the hot ring together, are not just consistent with the LSS data but in fact favored.

The complicated angular and LOS shape of the supervoid that we have already seen in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 require both more sophisticated modeling and more accurate measurements. However, the evidence that supports the idea of an elongated void cannot be derelicted.

The Cold Spot antipode

We extend the conventional LOS void profile analysis with the analysis of the antipodal direction. The motivation behind this analysis is the evidence in Fig. 4 that the Eridanus supervoid reaches our closest vicinity in the CS LOS, and there might be connections to the nearby antipodal regions. In fact, we find that this antipodal LOS traverses the Northern Local Supervoid, i.e. a prominent underdensity in the very local Universe studied for instance by [\cite=Lindner1997].

After passing through the NLV, the antipodal LOS becomes overdense while approaching the rich Hercules supercluster close in the Coma Great Wall, and the very rich, so-called multi-spider supercluster Corona Borealis, i.e. an important member of the Sloan Great Wall. Another example of a multi-spider supercluster is Centaurus [\citep=Courtois2013]. [\cite=Einasto2011] found that the CBS happens to be in the intersetion of the SGW and another large chain of superclusters, and it is a member of a huge system of rich superclusters, called the Dominant Supercluster Plane, located at right angles with respect to the Local supercluster [\citep=Einasto1997].

In Fig. 4, we show that the large-scale overdensity field, smeared by 2MPZ photo-zs, is consistent with r0=200 Mpc/h and δ0 = 0.40 in our framework. The 2MPZ galaxy counts at the CS are consistent with model supervoids shallower and longer than δ0 =  - 0.25 with r0=440 Mpc/h (see Fig. 5), mostly because of the lack of constraining power at high distances from the center of the supervoid. Note that a supervoid of radius r0=440 Mpc/h centered at z0 = 0.14 already extends fully to our position in space, therefore additional constraints on this LOS density profile might come from local density estimates. Moreover, a combined modeling of the antipodal counts from 2MPZ, and presumably more precise future CS density constraints from DES could be helpful for shrinking the allowed parts of this parameter space.

Our Fig. 6 is an updated version of a figure by [\cite=Lindner1997], showing the Dominant Supercluster Plane that happens to include the CS LOS that we are studying. We also added the approximate direction and location of the Draco supervoid, and named several prominent local supervoids and superclusters in the map, including Laniakea [\citep=Tully2014], the NLV, and the Southern Local Supervoid (SLV) [\citep=Einasto1994].

We can confirm our previous findings and make further observations. The CS line-of-sight:

avoids the local Laniakea supercluster

traverses both the NLV and SLV in the two antipodal directions (see also Fig. 4)

passes by the Horologium(-Reticulum) supercluster in the South (see also Fig. 3 and Fig. 4)

encounters the region of the Great Walls and the rich Hercules and Corona Borealis superclusters

The Draco supervoid, defined by the projected WISE-2MASS galaxy data in [\cite=FinelliEtal2014], may be similar to the NLV, or at least has a significant contribution for it to be a wide underdensity in the Northern sky, with presumably a rather oblate shape in the LOS.

The question arises: is this LOS that connects the most under- and overdense neighborhoods special? We create a full antipodal map for the smoothed HEALPIX maps Planck, 2MPZ, and the reconstructed and impainted 2MASS ISW [\citep=rassat2013]. The latter attempts to predict the ISW signal based on the 2MASS density field, which is very similar to that of 2MPZ. Then we take the difference of the original and antipodal maps, as shown in Fig. 3 map-by-map, and observe the following features:

the direction of the CS (yellow circle) is independently selected as the most dissimilar region in each map

the center of the large-angle underdensity around the CS location is somewhat misaligned with respect to the actual CS center, but the antipodal difference maps shows its extrema extraordinarily close to the nominal CS center

the extended underdensity labeled as Draco supervoid by [\cite=FinelliEtal2014] is the neighboring super-structure of the Great Walls region from another side than the Eridanus supervoid

the Draco supervoid in fact consists of several known voids, indicating that this large-angle underdensity is relatively close to us thus it presumably has an oblate shape

the direction of the Corona Borealis supercluster is surrounded by a set of other known voids

We analyzed Gaussian CMB and LSS simulation maps, and found that such a local dissimilarity at the [formula] level in the antipodal difference maps is not unusual on its own. The probability of having the most dissimilar direction in a CMB and in a LSS aligned within [formula] level appears to be small. Following [\cite=SzapudiEtAl2014], we consider two hypotheses: the supervoid of [formula] rarity in our data set (based on the antipodal statistic) is causing the CS (H2); and the random alignment hypothesis (H1). Considering a [formula] angular alignment results in [formula], while the antipodal statistic selects the CS with [formula] or [formula] probability. Note that our conclusions are independent of the probability [formula] or [formula] for the supervoid. With pH2 / pH1  =  pvoid / (pvoid  ×  pCS  ×  pmatch) we thus find that a causal relation between the CS and the Eridanus supervoid is favored by a factor of [formula], based on the antipodal statistic.

Discussion and Conclusions

We critically revisited the available observational constraints and theoretical considerations for unveiling the physical connection between the CMB Cold Spot and the Eridanus supervoid.

The main motivations for such a follow-up analysis were the possible shortcomings of the density and size estimates for the supervoid based on the PS1 photo-z maps by [\cite=SzapudiEtAl2014], and the detection of significant LOS elongation of SDSS supervoids that also appear to leave anomalous imprint in the CMB [\citep=Granett2015].

We performed tomographic imaging in several redshift slices, and measured the density profile of the Eridanus supervoid along the line-of-sight using the 2MPZ photo-z data, supplemented by spec-z information from the 6dF survey at z < 0.1. Our analysis provides important evidence for a LOS extent larger than the [formula] Mpc/h size estimated previously. We detect potentially meaningful substructure in the form of the underdensities at the lowest redshifts, where [\cite=SzapudiEtAl2014] found no depletion in their photo-z data. Our LSS data is consistent with an extremely elongated supervoid of depth δ0  =   - 0.25, inconstant transverse radius of at least [formula] Mpc/h, and LOS size [formula] Mpc/h.

Guided by the finding that the Eridanus supervoid appears to continue towards the lowest redshifts, we extended our LOS profile analysis into the antipodal direction, i.e. mapped the neighboring parts of the local Universe in the opposite direction. We discovered that the CS antipode crosses the Northern Local Supervoid, the rich Hercules supercluster, and the very rich Corona Borealis supercluster. Therefore, this line-of-sight intersects with the largest and richest supercluster systems in the local Universe, the Coma Great Wall and the Sloan Great Wall. Could this be a coincidence?

We then analyzed the full 2MPZ, Planck, and reconstructed 2MASS ISW data sets in order to test if this direction is significant and special in the observable sky. We found, remarkably, that the CS location is independently selected as the most dissimilar region in each map, pointing towards a physical connection between the CS and the Eridanus supervoid. Elliptical models for supervoids including estimates for ISW+RS imprints might predict meaningful contributions to the Cold Spot temperature [\citep=MarcosCaballero2015].

The most important question besides the expected ISW+RS imprint is the rarity of such an elongated supervoid in the ΛCDM framework. In general, similarly large voids of effective radius Reff  ≥  200 Mpc/h have been identified in SDSS-BOSS data sets, specially defined to potentially have larger spatial extent [\citep=Nadathur2015], or with photo-z tracers [\citep=GranettEtal2008]. In Fig. 8, we show the δ0  -  Reff parameter space for these voids, and find that the LOS size estimated for the Eridanus supervoid is larger than all reported void radii. However, little is known about the actual shape of the largest voids, because the ZOBOV algorithm assigns an effective radius Reff of a sphere for all underdensities of arbitrary shape. Modification of void finding algorithms and better understanding of voids identified in photometric data sets might reveal further details about this problem, and realistic prior knowledge on the expectation of atypical supervoids can be added to similar analyses.

As an outlook, in the light of the q = 2.6  ±  0.4 average LOS ellipticity estimated for the 50 Granett supervoids [\citep=Granett2015], we make an attempt to interpret the stronger-than-expected cold CMB imprint found for this special population of photo-z voids. We assume a simplistic constant linear galaxy bias parameter bg = 2, and calculate the expected ISW+RS imprints for z0 = 0.5, i.e. the typical redshift of the Granett supervoids. Doubling the LOS radius of the voids (pale red squares in Fig. 8), the average void position, therefore the expected average central ISW imprint from these supervoids, becomes more consistent with the apparently anomalous ΔT  =   - 11.3  ±  3.1 μK signal measured by [\cite=GranettEtal2008]. In the same way, the tension with the linear ISW prediction of ΔT  ~   - 1μK for similar supervoids (red dashed contour in Fig. 8) by [\cite=Nadathur2012] may relax. Proper estimation of ISW+RS effects of non-spherical supervoids is required for solid conclusions.

On the theoretical side, spherical supervoids of Reff  ≥  300 Mpc/h and δ0  ≈   - 0.25 are not expected to practically exist at z < 0.5, assuming ΛCDM physics [\citep=Nadathur2014]. However, there is firm observational evidence and theoretical expectation for O(10) supervoids of Reff  ≈  200 Mpc/h and δ0  ≤   - 0.25 in the local Universe, and the currently unexplored nature of the interconnection of these already extended underdensities might provide surprises.

Again, the unusually elongated shape that we reconstructed for the Eridanus supervoid is a property that makes the actual predictions more complicated. The same applies to large filamentary superclusters like the Sloan Great Wall, that are hard to effectively model within the spherical framework [\citep=Sheth2011].

Whether Great Walls and elongated supervoids are more abundant than expected, has to be further investigated in large N-body simulations. Connections to other known local underdensities and anomalies shall also be studied [\citep=Schwarz2015] [\citep=Boehringer2015] [\citep=Whitbourn2014] [\citep=Vikram2015] [\citep=PadillaTorres2009] [\citep=FloresCacho2009] [\citep=KeenanEtal2012] [\citep=Horvath2015].

In any case, the more precise mapping we carried out for the Eridanus supervoid further enhanced its dimensions and pointed out connections to significant local voids and the Great Wall region. Given the size of these matter fluctuations, the analysis and revision of the Copernican principle is of high importance, especially in a statistical fashion [\citep=Nadathur2013] [\citep=Alonso2015]. In case more precise future mappings, and more sophisticated modeling will accurately elucidate the physical connection between the Cold Spot, the Eridanus supervoid, and the region of the Great Walls, the Eridanus constellation may become the most promising laboratory for Dark Energy experiments.
