Magnetism, spin texture and in-gap states: Atomic specialization at the surface of oxygen-deficient SrTiO3

Introduction.- Transition metal oxides constitute a major topic of interest in the scientific community as these materials are endowed with a broad range of significant electronic properties, i.e. functionalities, ranging from ferroelectricity to metal-insulator transitions as well as from magnetism to superconductivity. Many of these compounds exhibit structural instabilities, strong electronic correlations and complex phase diagrams with competing ground states. Artificial structures of transition metal oxides therefore seem ideal to explore interfacial effects that could possibly lead to new phases. In this respect, the two-dimensional electronic system (2DES) at the interface between the wide band-gap insulators LaAlO3 (LAO) and SrTiO3 (STO) that was observed by Ohtomo and Hwang [\cite=Ohtomo2004] [\cite=Thiel2006] a decade ago has attracted a considerable amount of attention. It was found that the 2DES hosts gate-tunable insulator to metal, insulator to superconductor transitions, magnetism [\cite=Bert2011] and a large interfacial spin-orbit effect [\cite=Sulpizio2014]. The mechanisms responsible for these special properties are still under debate. Questions include the intrinsic (i.e. electronic reconstruction) versus extrinsic (e.g. oxygen vacancies) mechanism [\cite=Berner2013] responsible for the formation of the 2DES, and also the role and spatial distribution of the various d orbitals which could contribute selectively to a specific charge or spin property.

Angular-resolved photoemission (ARPES) measurements revealed the existence of 2DES with similar features to those seen at the LAO-STO interface at bare surfaces of several insulating perovskite oxide crystals, and among them (001) oriented STO [\cite=Santander-Syro2011] [\cite=Baumberger2011]. In this case, the carriers originate from oxygen vacancies, since constitutive layers of the structure are charge neutral. These vacancies are likely created during the sample preparation process and also when the sample is illuminated during the measurement [\cite=Walker2014]. Spin resolved ARPES (SARPES) of the 2DES at the (001) oriented STO surface [\cite=Santander-Syro2014] have highlighted the existence of sizable Rashba-like spin textures along with a large energy splitting that has been interpreted as a signature of ferromagnetism. Their simultaneous occurrence is puzzling since the two effects a priori compete with each other and estimates of the respective energy scales give about 100 meV for magnetism and a few meV for surface spin-orbit coupling.

A number of density functional theory (DFT) studies pertaining to bulk STO and including local correlation effects found in-gap bound states below the conduction band and magnetism, when isolated oxygen vacancies or pairs of vacancies are present [\cite=Cuong2007] [\cite=Hou2010] [\cite=Lopez2015] in the bulk. The reported location of the bound state and the size of the spin polarization depend strongly on the computational details. Recent DFT calculations for slab geometries [\cite=Shen2012] [\cite=Li2013] [\cite=Jeschke2015] found qualitative agreement with the bulk case. In addition, in the latter case DFT finds a 2DES as soon as oxygen vacancies are incorporated in the slab, as evidenced by the presence of dispersive t2g bands at the Fermi energy. Effects of spin orbit coupling [\cite=Zhong2013] [\cite=Khalsa2013], correlation [\cite=Lin2013] have also been studied at the model level.

In the present work, we investigate via first principles DFT the spin textures and magnetism of the 2DES states at the (001) oriented surface of STO and we determine how these emerge from the electronic states that are formed in the presence of oxygen single- and divacancies near the surface. Importantly, we find that magnetic solutions are lower in energy than nonmagnetic ones and thus need to be taken into account. Further insight into the origin of the in-gap states and of the 2DES states is obtained through tight-binding modeling of divacancies. As the preexisting literature on this problem is already large, let us emphasize that the new results reported here are relevant for the interpretation of the following experimental facts: (i) ARPES spectra pertaining to 2DES at interfaces and also at surfaces all seem to appear concomitant with a universal non-dispersive feature at an energy of about 1.3 eV below the Fermi energy [\cite=Aiura2002] [\cite=Courths1980] [\cite=Kim2009]; and (ii) spin-ARPES appears to highlight the occurrence of both Rashba-like textures and ferromagnetism [\cite=Santander-Syro2014].

Methods.- For our DFT calculations we considered various slabs of (001) oriented STO with different oxygen vacancy concentrations. From the large range of possible slab structures and vacancy configurations we have selected three representative cases; a single vacancy at the topmost level of a SrO-terminated 2×  2×  4 slab (Fig. [\ref=fig:structures] (a)), a vertical divacancy at the topmost level of a SrO-terminated 2×  2×  4 slab (Fig. [\ref=fig:structures] (a)), and a horizontal divacancy sandwiching a Ti atom located at the topmost level of a TiO2-terminated 3×  3×  4 slab (Fig. [\ref=fig:structures] (b)). These slabs are chosen as test cases for investigating the effects of surface reconstruction, in-gap states, Rashba spin-orbit coupling and magnetism. In all slabs we included a vacuum layer of at least 20 Å to avoid any spurious interactions between the periodic images. The trade-off between considering large enough slabs to avoid boundary effects and computational efficiency dictated our choice of supercell sizes. Note, that our single vacancy 2×  2×  4 and divacancy 3×  3×  4 slabs have realistic carrier densities of about 1.5  ×  1014 cm- 2 as obtained by integrating occupied densities of states and of about 3  ×  1014 cm- 2 as estimated from Fermi surface areas.

In order to account for possible surface reconstructions, the internal coordinates of the slabs were relaxed with the projector-augmented wave basis [\cite=Bloechl1994a] as implemented in VASP [\cite=Kresse1996] [\cite=Hafner2008]. For the relaxations and electronic structure calculations we used the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) [\cite=Perdew1996] in the Dudarev [\cite=Dudarev1998] GGA+U scheme as described in Ref. [\cite=Shen2012]. The electronic structure was analyzed with the all-electron full-potential local orbital ( FPLO) [\cite=FPLO] method and GGA+U functional [\cite=Liechtenstein1995]. Checks were also performed with the all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method as implemented in Wien2k [\cite=Blaha2001]. Spin textures for the various slabs were obtained from full relativistic calculations in FPLO (GGA+SO+U) with a newly implemented subroutine.

Results and discussion.- We start first with the analysis of spin textures in the absence of magnetism. In Figs. [\ref=fig:spintexture] (a) and  [\ref=fig:spintexture] (d) we show the spin textures at the Fermi surface (kz = 0) obtained for non-magnetic ground states in GGA+SO+U calculations for the single vacancy 2×  2×  4 and the divacancy 3×  3×  4 slabs, respectively (results for the divacancy 2×  2×  4 are shown in the Suppl. Mat.). We used typical values for the parameters (U=5 eV and JH=0.64 eV on Ti 3d orbitals [\cite=Okamoto2006]). In all cases, every two bands show a small energy splitting of a few meV at the Fermi surface, due to the spin-orbit interaction. Spins on the Fermi surface (kz  =  0) are fully polarized parallel to the surface xy plane, aligned in opposite direction to each other in the split bands. On some of the bands the spins are pointing clock- and anti-clockwise around the center of the Brillouin zone, which is a clear signature of the relativistic Rashba effect due to the breaking of inversion symmetry at the surface of SrTiO3. On other bands we additionally notice a more complex texture of rotating spins, born out of the interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom [\cite=Walker2014] [\cite=King2014]. The rather small size of the spin-splitting contrasts with the large value reported in recent SARPES experiments [\cite=Santander-Syro2014].

Next, we consider solutions with ferromagnetic order and spin-orbit interactions. The spin polarized solution is indeed the groundstate of the systems we consider: At the GGA+SO+U=5 eV level, the ferromagnetic solution lowers the energy by 14.9 meV/f.u. for a single O vacancy in the 2×  2×  4 slab, and by 7.3 meV/f.u. for a divacancy in the 3×  3×  4 slab; the difference in stabilization energy arises from the respective total moments of 0.125 μB/f.u. and 0.077 μB/f.u. which are averaged over the 16 and 36 formula units of the two slabs. For the 2×  2×  4 slab, Fig. [\ref=fig:spintexture] (b) displays the spin-projected bandstructure obtained from spin-polarized GGA+SO+U calculations for the 2×  2×  4 slab with one vacancy (similarly, results for the divacancy 2×  2×  4 slab are shown in the Suppl. Inf.). We adopt the magnetic moment quantization axis along z but below we also discuss the case of a quantization along x. The size of the magnetic splitting can be inferred from the black arrows connecting the majority and minority spin bands. For a comparison to the experiment we have to consider the splitting of the light bands of dxy character, as heavy bands have been silenced in the measurements [\cite=Santander-Syro2014]. The energy separation at the Γ point of the two spin-split dxy bands originating from Tid (Fig. [\ref=fig:structures](a)) is of the order of 60 meV and therefore in qualitative agreement to the experimental data (Ref. [\cite=Santander-Syro2014], ΔE  ≈  100 meV).

In order to identify the microscopic origin of the peculiar electronic and magnetic features described above we plot in Fig. [\ref=fig:224bandstructure] the layer and orbitally resolved GGA+SO+U bandstructure near EF for the one-vacancy 2×  2×  4 slab (similar plots are shown in the Suppl. Inf for the divacancy 2×  2×  4 slab) and in Fig. [\ref=fig:224mm] (a) we display the Ti t2g - eg resolved magnetic moments as a function of the distance between Ti and O vacancy. We find that (i) the magnetic splitting of the light dxy bands at the Fermi level is caused by itinerant electrons belonging to Ti located not in the immediate vicinity of the oxygen vacancy (e.g. Tid in Fig. [\ref=fig:structures] (a)) with magnetic moments of the order of 0.1 μB (see Fig. [\ref=fig:224mm] (a)). (ii) Ti atoms neighboring the oxygen vacancy in the uppermost layer (Tia, Tib, Tic in Fig. [\ref=fig:structures](a)) have the largest magnetic moment (Fig. [\ref=fig:224mm] (a)) and are mostly responsible for the heavy bands and occupied states at higher binding energies (see Fig. [\ref=fig:224bandstructure]). In particular, we observe an in-gap band of Ti eg (dz2) character hybridizing with Ti 4s and 4p corresponding to Tia. It sits at -0.4 eV in the single vacancy case and is shifted to about -1 eV in the divacancy case (see Suppl. Inf.) The position of this band depends on the parameters U and JH chosen for the GGA+U calculations and on the concentration and position of vacancies in the slab (see Suppl. Mat. and Ref. [\cite=Jeschke2015]). Note that this band has some dispersion due to the fact that the slab is too small and eg Bloch states between neighboring unit cells are formed.

Interestingly, already with this minimal slab, we find a phenomenon of atomic specialization, i.e. there are two types of electronic contributions to magnetism: one from Ti atoms neighboring the oxygen vacancy that acquire rather large magnetic moments and are mostly located below the Fermi surface inducing in-gap states; and another, from those Ti atoms lying further away from the oxygen vacancies, that correspond to polarized t2g itinerant electrons with small magnetic moments, which are responsible for the Rashba spin winding and the spin splitting at the Fermi surface. These remarkable effects will be even more pronounced in larger slabs.

In the 3×  3×  4 slab (Fig. [\ref=fig:structures](b)) the loss of symmetry due to the presence of the vacancies induces a ladder of bands at EF corresponding to inequivalent Ti atoms (Fig. [\ref=fig:spintexture] (f)) and a breaking of the xy symmetry as also observed in the Fermi surface topography (Fig. [\ref=fig:spintexture] (d)). In experiment, such an asymmetry is not observed and is here a consequence of considering an individual divacancy realization. This asymmetry is expected to decrease when larger slab geometries and a disorder average are considered, which is beyond our computational possibilities.

The Ti atom in between the oxygen vacancies (Tia in Fig. [\ref=fig:structures] (b)) gives rise to a heavy eg band of dx2 - y2 character which appears at the Fermi surface, while the neighboring Tib, due to the very special divacancy geometry, create dominantly dxz in-gap states at -0.5 eV. Note, that a different arrangement of the divacancy in this slab has been found [\cite=Jeschke2015] to shift the heavy eg state to the gap region consistent with experimental observations.

We observe here the same phenomenon of atomic specialization as in the smaller 2×  2×  4 slab; Ti atoms neighboring the oxygen vacancies (Tia and Tib in Fig. [\ref=fig:structures] (b)) acquire large magnetic moments (see Fig. [\ref=fig:224mm] (b)) and are responsible for the in-gap states located at higher binding energies; while Ti atoms lying further away from the oxygen vacancy (Tic and beyond) contribute to the 2DES with itinerant electrons carrying small magnetic moments, which are responsible for the Rashba spin winding and the spin splitting at EF.

Further insight into the atomic dichotomy can be gained through tight-binding cluster diagonalization (see Suppl. Inf.) of structures with various configurations of vacancies. In order to monitor the formation of the 2DES conduction band states and of the in-gap states, we adiabatically turn on the energy contributions that represent the effect of introducing a vacancy into the cluster. Features seen in DFT are qualitatively reproduced.

We now examine how magnetism and surface spin-orbit coupling interplay with each other. Based on our above discussion of each individual effect, we may infer that spin textures and spin splitting compete with each other in the t2g bands. Fig. [\ref=fig:spintexture] (c) displays the spin texture at kz = 0 obtained from spin-polarized GGA+SO+U calculations for the 2×  2×  4 slab with one vacancy. The spin texture shows signs of the Rashba winding but it is less pronounced than in the nonmagnetic case. Taking a closer look at the inner pockets in Fig. [\ref=fig:spintexture] (c) (blue and red circles centered at Γ) corresponding to the spin up and spin down projections (compare Fig. [\ref=fig:spintexture] (b)), we observe a significant Fermi momentum shift of the bands ([formula]), which is of the same order of magnitude as the one observed in SARPES experiments [\cite=Santander-Syro2014]. As can be seen from the now very small in-plane spin component ([formula]), ferromagnetism is dominating the arrangement of the spins. Inclusion of magnetism in GGA+SO+U calculations for the 3×  3×  4 slab with an oxygen divacancy also yields a shift of ~  0.1 Å- 1 at EF (Fig. [\ref=fig:spintexture] (f)) and while the spin winding is still visible, the in-plane spin component is small. In contrast to the non-magnetic calculations, inclusion of correlation effects as implemented in the GGA+U functional is important for describing the Ti magnetic moments. All these observations are in agreement with the results of the smaller 2×  2×  4 slab and confirm the general validity of the results.

Recent SQUID (scanning superconducting quantum interference device, Ref. [\cite=Bert2011]) measurements on LAO/STO interfaces observed a preference of in-plane magnetic moments, which are ascribed to shape anisotropy. As this is also expected for pure STO surfaces, we additionally performed calculations with the magnetization axis along x; in this case spins are aligned in plane and the Rashba interaction is unable to rotate the spins to achieve a sign change for opposite k points. However, a canting of the spin polarization vectors away from the magnetic axis originating from the Rashba coupling can be still identified, in agreement with previous theoretical considerations [\cite=Barnes2014]. Our results would be compatible with SARPES spectra which see both an almost pure Rashba spin texture and a full in-plane polarization if we assume that the measurements detect a signal from a large number of ferromagnetic domains at once. In this case the effect of magnetism on the alignment of the spin polarization vectors is averaged out and the measured spin texture is completely determined by spin-orbit coupling effects, restoring the sign change for opposite k points. Therefore the main features are independent of the magnetic quantization axis.

Conclusions.- By performing full relativistic non-magnetic and magnetic density functional theory calculations in the framework of GGA+SO+U on representative oxygen deficient SrTiO3 slabs, we find the magnetic state to be the ground state and we observe clear signatures of atomic specialization of the electronic and magnetic contributions. Ti atoms neighboring the oxygen vacancies create eg localized wavefunctions with large magnetic moments and are responsible for the presence of in-gap states at energies around -0.5 to -1 eV. The position of the in-gap states is influenced by the slab termination, the depth of the oxygen vacancy below the surface and by possible oxygen clustering. On the other hand, Ti atoms lying further away from the oxygen vacancy contribute with polarized t2g itinerant electrons to the conducting 2DES and are responsible for the Rashba spin winding and the spin splitting at the Fermi surface observed in SARPES. Our calculations show that magnetism masks the Rashba effect by increasing the spin splitting of the t2g orbitals and by modifying the individual spin orientation but it does not eliminate spin winding. Considering that an averaging of inhomogeneities near the surface of the measured sample is to be expected (e.g. a sea of 2DES interspersed with islands of magnetism perhaps mirroring a mixture of TiO2 and SrO in the termination layer), SARPES measurements are explained by our calculations as the combined effect of Rashba and magnetism.
