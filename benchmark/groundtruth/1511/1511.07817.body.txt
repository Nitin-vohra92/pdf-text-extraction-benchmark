Unistructurality of cluster algebras of type [formula]

Introduction

Cluster algebras were introduced in 2002 by Fomin and Zelevinsky in [\cite=FZ02] in order to create an algebraic framework for canonical bases and total positivity. Since then, cluster algebras have been proved to relate to various areas of mathematics, for example, combinatorics, representation theory of algebras, Lie theory, Poisson geometry and Teichmüller theory.

Cluster algebras are commutative [formula]-algebras with a distinguished set of generators, called cluster variables, grouped into sets called clusters. The set of all cluster variables is constructed recursively from a set of initial cluster variables using an operation called mutation. Every mutation defines a new cluster differing from the preceding one by a single cluster variable. A conjecture from Assem, Schiffler and Shramchenko in [\cite=ASS14] states that if two clusters generate the same cluster algebra, then each cluster is obtained from the other by a sequence of mutations, that is, there exists a unique decomposition of the set of cluster variables into clusters. It is then said that such a cluster algebra is unistrucutural. The authors already proved it for cluster algebras of rank 2 or of Dynkin type. In this paper, we prove that cluster algebras of type [formula] are unistructural.

To do so, we use triangulations of marked surfaces, defined by [\cite=FST08] and lifted triangulations of marked surfaces [\cite=ST09] [\cite=Sch10]. Indeed, cluster variables are in one-to-one correspondence with isotopy classes of certain curves in the surface that are called arcs. Clusters are in bijection with triangulations, which are maximal sets of compatible arcs. Hence, we study cluster algebras through triangulations of annuli.

Finally, we prove the automorphism conjecture, formulated in [\cite=ASS14], for cluster algebras of type [formula] as a direct corollary of the unistructurality of these algebras. This conjecture states that, for [formula] a cluster algebra, [formula] is a cluster automorphism if and only if f is an automorphism of the ambient field which restricts to a permutation of the set of cluster variables. This conjecture is related to Conjecture 7.4(2) in [\cite=FZ07] of Fomin and Zelevinsky, restated by [\cite=ASS14] as follows. Two cluster variables x and x' in a cluster algebra [formula] are compatible if and only if for each cluster Y of [formula] containing x, it is possible to write x' as a Laurent polynomial in Y of the reduced form [formula] where P is a polynomial in the variables of Y and M is a monomial in the variables of Y excluding x. This conjecture has been proven for cluster algebras arising from surfaces, so, in particular, for cluster algebras of type [formula], see [\cite=FST08].

Preliminaries

Cluster algebras

A quiver Q is a quadruple (Q0,Q1,s,t) such that Q0 is a set whose elements are called points, Q1 is a set whose elements are called arrows and s, t: ~ Q1  →  Q0 are two maps which associate to each arrow two points respectively called its source and its target. For i∈Q0, we denote i+ the set of arrows in Q1 of source i. Similarly, i- is the set of arrows in Q1 of target i As part of the study of cluster algebras, one looks only at quivers with neither loops (arrows α∈Q1 such that s(α)  =  t(α)) nor 2-cycles (pairs of arrows (α,β)∈Q1  ×  Q1 such that t(α)  =  s(β) and t(β)  =  s(α)).

Let K be a field and k a subfield of K. A set [formula] is algebraically independent over k if, for all polynomials [formula], f  ≠  0, we have [formula]. A seed (X,Q) consists of a quiver Q whose points are [formula] and a set [formula], algebraically independent over [formula], where we agree that xi corresponds to the point i. The set X is called a cluster. The mutation of a seed (X,Q) in direction xk (or in direction k if there is no ambiguity) transforms (X,Q) into a new seed μxk(X,Q)  =  (μxk(X),μk(Q)) where μk(Q) is a quiver obtained by achieving the followings steps on Q:

reverse all arrows incident to k;

for all pairs of arrows α,β∈Q1 such that t(α)  =  k  =  s(β), add a new arrow δ such that s(δ)  =  α and t(δ)  =  β;

remove one-by-one the ensuing 2-cycles,

and [formula] with xk' such that

[formula]

An empty product is put equal to 1. We call the equality above the exchange relation. We denote by [formula] the union of all possible clusters obtained from the seed (X,Q) by successive mutations and we call its elements cluster variables. Two cluster variables are said to be compatible if there exists a cluster containing both. The cluster algebra [formula] is the [formula]-subalgebra of the ambient field [formula] generated by [formula].

Observe that quiver mutation is involutive and, hence, mutations of quivers induce an equivalence. It is said that two quivers Q and R are mutation-equivalent if there exists a sequence of mutations [formula] such that R  =  μ(Q). A cluster algebra [formula] is of type [formula] if Q is mutation-equivalent to the following quiver:

In order to prove the unistructurality of cluster algebras of type [formula], we need a few properties of cluster algebras. One of them is the Laurent phenomenon, see [\cite=FZ02]. It asserts that, for any cluster algebra [formula] and for any cluster [formula] in this algebra, each cluster variable can be written as a Laurent polynomial in Y, that is, for all [formula],

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula]. In particular,

[formula]

Another interesting result about cluster algebras is the positivity theorem [\cite=LS15]. It states that the numerator P of a cluster variable written as a reduced Laurent polynomial has only non-negative coefficients. In particular, [formula] and

[formula]

Unistructurality

Recall the definition of an exchange graph [formula] introduced [\cite=FZ02] for a seed (X,Q). The set of vertices [formula] is the set of clusters in [formula] and two clusters are joined by an edge if and only if one can be obtained from the other by a mutation, that is, they differ by a single cluster variable.

[\cite=ASS14] We say that the cluster algebra [formula] is unistructural if, for any subset Y of cluster variables of [formula] and for any quiver R such that (Y,R) generates the same set of cluster variables, then [formula] and the sets of clusters of [formula] and of [formula] are the same. More precisely, if (Y,R) generates by all possible successive mutations a family of cluster variables [formula], then

the equality [formula] implies that [formula]

there exists a permutation σ of [formula] such that Xα  =  Yσ(β) for any [formula] and with [formula].

We already know that cluster algebras of rank 2 and of Dynkin type are unistructural [\cite=ASS14]. The next conjecture is from [\cite=ASS14].

All cluster algebras are unistructural.

Triangulations and universal covers

Rather than studying cluster algebras of type [formula] by performing mutations on their quivers, we study triangulations of annuli by flipping their arcs. The following definitions are adapted from [\cite=FST08].

A marked surface (S,M) consists of a connected oriented 2-dimensional Riemann surface S with boundary and a nonempty finite set of marked points M in the closure of S with at least one marked point on each boundary component. Marked points in the interior of S are called punctures. An arc γ in (S,M) is the isotopy class of a curve such that:

the endpoints of the curve are in M;

the curve does not selfintersect, except that its endpoints may coincide;

the curve is disjoint from M and the boundary of S except for its endpoints;

the curve does not cut out an unpunctured monogon, that is the curve is not contractible into a point of M.

An arc is interior if it is not (isotopic to) an arc lying on the boundary of S and it is a boundary arc otherwise. Two arcs are compatible if there are curves in their respective isotopy classes which do not intersect, except perhaps at their endpoints. A triangulation is a maximal collection of pairwise compatible arcs.

Let T be a triangulation of an unpunctured marked surface. A flip μγ in T replaces one particular arc γ by the unique arc γ'  ≠  γ which, together with the remaining arcs of T, forms a new triangulation. Because flips are clearly involutive, we call two triangulations flip-equivalent if they are connected by a sequence of flips.

One can associates a quiver QT to a triangulation T of an unpunctured marked surface (S,M) as follows. The points of QT correspond to the interior arcs of T. Let γ1 and γ2 be two sides of a triangle in T. There is an arrow α such that s(α)  =  γ1 and t(α)  =  γ2 if and only if γ2 follows γ1 with respect to the orientation of S around their common vertex. The cluster algebra [formula] given by a cluster X and the quiver QT is called the cluster algebra associated to the surface (S,M). If Tk is obtained from T by a flip replacing an arc labeled k, then, QTk  =  μk(QT) (see [\cite=FST08]). Indeed, one can show that [formula] does not depend on the particular triangulation T we started from [\cite=FST08]. It is therefore possible to study cluster algebras associated to a marked surface through triangulations of this surface. More precisely, clusters are in one-to-one correspondence with triangulations and cluster variables are in one-to-one correspondence with arcs.

The exchange relation arising from flipping γ in this figure is the Ptolemy relation xγxγ' = xαxδ  +  xβxε, where xη denotes the cluster variable associated to the arc η (if some of the sides are boundary arcs, the corresponding variables are replaced by 1). We call such a set of arcs α, β, δ and ε a quadrilateral and the arcs γ and γ' its diagonals.

If QT is a quiver of type [formula], then T is the triangulation of an annulus with p points on one boundary and q points on the other, see [\cite=ABCP10]. In an annulus, arcs with both endpoints on the same boundary are called peripherical while arcs with endpoints on different boundaries are called bridging.

The quiver Q in the figure [\ref=A_3] [\ref=2] and the triangulation T in the figure [\ref=T-A_3] [\ref=2] are associated, that is Q  =  QT. Moreover, μ4(Q) and T' are associated.

Let associate the cluster variable xi to arc i. By the Ptolemy relation, we find x4x4'  =  x1  ·  1  +  1  ·  x5.

The arc 4 in T is bridging, while its flip, the arc 4' in T', is peripherical. Note that 4' is not isotopic to the inside boundary of the annulus, because of the another marked point on it.

Representing and visualizing arcs in annuli can rapidly be confusing if they wrap around the inside boundary. Therefore, one prefers to use a universal cover. Let Q, [formula] be two quivers such that [formula] acts freely on [formula], that is n  ·  ĩ  ≠  ĩ for all points ĩ∈0 and all [formula]. Note [formula] and [formula] for all i, j∈Q0 and for all ĩ, ∈0. A Galois covering π:  →  Q is given by two maps π0:0  →  Q0 and π1:1  →  Q1 such that:

for all points ĩ, ∈0, we have [formula];

the map π0 is surjective;

for all [formula], we have [formula];

if ĩ, ∈0 such that π0(ĩ)  =  π0(), then there exists [formula] such that   =  n  ·  ĩ;

for all ĩ∈0, π1 induces two bijections [formula] and [formula].

If Q  =  QT and   =  T̃, it induces a map π':T̃  →  T. The triangulation T̃ is called the lifted triangulation of T.

The elements of the fiber π- 1(i) of a point i in Q0 are of the form ĩn with [formula]. Let [formula]. Then, i(T̃)  =  (π')- 1(μi(T)), see [\cite=Sch10].

Triangulations in Figure [\ref=T-A_3] [\ref=2-revetement] are the lifted triangulations of triangulations in Figure [\ref=T-A_3] [\ref=2].

Unistructurality for [formula]

In order to prove the theorem [\ref=yeah], we need this technical lemma.

Let x1 and x2 be two variables from a cluster algebra [formula] and let Σ1, Σ2 and Σ3 be sums of products of cluster variables with positive coefficients such that x1x2 is not a term of these sums or is not the only one.

If x1x2  =  Σ1, then [formula] or [formula].

If x1x2Σ1  =  Σ1Σ2  +  Σ3, then x1 or [formula].

Each cluster variable of [formula] can be written as a Laurent polynomial in X. Therefore, Σ1, as a sum of products of cluster variables, can also be written as a Laurent polynomial, say [formula], where P1 is a polynomial in X and M1 is a monomial in X. We now have [formula], which is equivalent to

[formula]

If x1∈X and x2∈X, we would get a contradiction to the algebraic independence of X.

Let [formula], where Pi is a polynomial in X and Mi a monomial in X for i = 1,2,3. Thereby, we obtain [formula] which gives

[formula]

By the positivity theorem, coefficients of the terms in X in cluster variables are positive; it is in particular the case in P3. Since there is a minus sign on the right side of the equality, we deduce that, either M3P1P2  =  0, which is impossible, or each of the terms of the development of M3P2 appears in the development of x1x2M2 with a coefficient greater or equal.

Suppose that x1∈X and x2∈X; in particular, they are monomials. Since x1x2M2 is only a product of variables of X without any coefficient, we deduce that P2  =  x1x2M2, thus, M1M2P3  =  0, which is once again a contradiction to the algebraic independence of X.

Cluster algebras of type [formula] are unistructural.

Let [formula] and Y be algebraically independent sets on [formula], Q a quiver of type [formula] and R a quiver such that the cluster variables of [formula] and of [formula] are the same. Remark that a consequence of that hypothesis is that X et Y have the same number of elements, which is the cardinality of a transcendence basis of the (common) ambient field. We show that Y is a cluster of [formula].

Assume to the contrary that Y is not a cluster of X. Thus, there exists two variables yi and yj of Y incompatible in [formula]. We know that variables of [formula] are associated with arcs of an annulus with p marked points on a border and q points on the other one. Consider the arcs γi and γj associated to yi and yj in [formula]. Let i1 and i2 be the endpoints of γi and j1 and j2 be the endpoints of γj. We have to study three cases: the arcs γi and γj can both be periphical, both bridging or one is periphical and the other is bridging.

First case: the arc γi is periphical and the arc γj is bridging. Without loss of generality, assume that i1, i2 and j1 are all on the same border. Consider the triangulation of Figure [\ref=p1-t1] where z1, z2, z3 and z4 are cluster variables of a same cluster of [formula]. Note that z1 and z2 could be associated to boundary arcs, in which case they are equal to 1. Note also that it is possible that i1 = i2.

By the Ptolemy relation, we obtain

[formula]

Now, z1z3  +  z2z4 is a sum of product of cluster variables in [formula] so it is also the case in [formula]. Therefore, Lemma [\ref=Laurent] ensures that yi or [formula], which is a contradiction to the initial hypothesis.

Second case: the arcs γi and γj are peripherical. If they intersect each other exactly once, there exists once again a quadrilateral with these arcs as diagonals, as shown in Figure [\ref=qp2] (where possibly i1 = j2), and we again obtain a contradiction to Lemma [\ref=Laurent].

Now assume that γi et γj intersect each other twice. By representing them in the lifted triangulation of an annulus, one sees easily that they cannot intersect each other more than twice and that, in that case, i1 and i2 are necessarily distinct from j1 and j2. First, consider the case where i1, i2, j1 and j2 are all distinct. Let Z be the cluster of [formula] associated with the triangulation of Figure [\ref=p2-u] (represented as a lifted triangulation) with [formula] and z1  =  yi.

Remark that [formula] could be associated with boundary arcs. Consider the sequence of mutations in order to obtain yj as shown in figure [\ref=p2].

Remark that the last triangulation of Figure [\ref=p2] implies z5'  =  yj. Moreover, because of the Ptolemy relation, we obtain the following five equalities:

z1z1'  =  z2z5  +  z4z8;

z2z2'  =  z1'z3  +  z8z10;

z3z3'  =  z2'z9  +  z4z8;

z4z4'  =  z1'z3'  +  z2'z5;

z5z5'  =  z3'z7  +  z4'z6.

From these equalities, we develop the expression z1z1'z2'z5' :

[formula]

where

[formula]

Recall that every zk and zk', being cluster variables of [formula], are also cluster variables of [formula], so are Laurent polynomial in Y. The same applies to Σ3 since it is a sum of products of cluster variables. By Lemma [\ref=Laurent], [formula] or [formula] (because yi = z1 and yj = z5), which is a contradiction.

If we have i1 = i2 or j1 = j2, we would arrive at the same contradiction, but the sequence of flips to achieve it would be shorter because some arcs would be equal.

Third case: the arcs γi and γj are bridging. As a first step, consider the case where i1 and j1, as well as i2 and j2, are distinct, and where the arcs γi are γj intersect each other exactly once. Then, there exists a quadrilateral with γi and γj as diagonals shown in triangulation of the Figure [\ref=t2] and we obtain the same contradiction as in the first case.

Now consider the cases where γi et γj intersect each other n times with n  ≥  2. Let Z be the cluster of [formula] associated to the triangulation in Figure [\ref=n=2-1]

There exists, up to symmetry, a unique arc γj intersecting γi n times. For n = 2, this arc is represented by a dotted line. After a sequence of flips, we obtain this arc (see Figure [\ref=n=2]).

We obtain the arc γj associated to z4'  =  yj. By the Ptolemy relation, we deduce the following equalities:

z1z1'  =  z2z3  +  z4z6;

z2z2'  =  z1'z5  +  z3z6;

[formula];

z4z4'  =  z1'z8  +  z3'z7.

We use some of these equalities to develop the expression z1z1'z4'.

[formula]

where Σ1  =  z2z3z4' et Σ2  =  z3'z6z7  +  Σ1. Since z1  =  xi' et z4'  =  xj', we obtain once again a contradiction as a consequence of Lemma [\ref=Laurent].

If the γi and γj intersect each other n = 3 times, we have to achieve an additional mutation from the last triangulation of the Figure [\ref=n=2] to obtain the arc γj; this mutation is shown in Figure [\ref=n=3]. Note that, in this figure, the arc γi is represented by a dotted line.

From the mutations of variables, we obtain the equality z1'z1''  =  z2'z7  +  z3'z4'. We develop the product z1z1'z3'z1'':

[formula]

where Σ4  =  z1''z3'z4z6, Σ5  =  z1''z2z2'z4  +  Σ4 and Σ6  =  z1'z2z2'z7  +  Σ5. Using Lemma [\ref=Laurent], we find once again [formula] or [formula], so yi or [formula].

Now consider the case where n = 4, that is where the arcs γi and γj intersect each other four times. We obtain γj from last triangulation of Figure [\ref=n=3] after two other mutations, shown at Figure [\ref=n=4].

We obtain equalities z3'z3''  =  z1''z8  +  z4'z7 and [formula] with the Ptolemy relation.

From now on, we can consider the general case where γi and γj intersect each other n times, with n  ≥  4. Denote μ0  =  μ3μ1μ4μ3μ2μ1 (it is all mutations until now achieved except for the last one). Denote also by z(k)1 et z(k)4 the last variables obtained by sequences of mutations (μ1μ4)k - 2μ0 and μ2(μ1μ4)k - 2μ0 respectively, with k  ≥  3.

A simple induction yields

[formula]

and

[formula]

Moreover, from Figure [\ref=n=4], remark by induction that the arc associated to z(k)1 intersects 2k - 1 times γi and the arc associated to z(k)2 intersects it 2k times for k  ≥  3. Using equality [\ref=3.1], we obtain

[formula]

where Σ7  =  z1'z2z2'z3'z3''  +  z4''Σ6. Hence, we deduce by induction

[formula]

and

[formula]

for m  ≥  3 and where Σ2m + 2 and Σ2m + 3 are sums of products of cluster algebras with positive coefficients.

Using Lemma [\ref=Laurent], we conclude that [formula] or [formula] for all k  ≥  3. Similarly, [formula] or [formula] for all k  ≥  3. If i1 = j1 or i2 = j2, the proof technique would be similar, but we would consider less arcs in triangulations and, hence, there would be less mutations to achieve. Thus, if yj is associated with a bridging arc intersecting γi (regardless of the number of crossings), [formula] or [formula].

Since we have proved that yi and yj cannot be associated with a peripherical arc and a bridging arc, to two peripherical arcs or to two bridging arcs intersecting each other in [formula], then they are associated with two compatible arcs of [formula]. Hence, yi and yj are compatible variables in [formula] and, since |Y|  =  |X|, Y is a cluster of [formula].

To show that cluster algebras of type [formula] are unistructural, we still have to show that R is a quiver of type [formula]. To do so, we adapt the proof from [\cite=ASS14-2] for the Dynkin case. Let [formula] be a cluster of [formula] associated to the following quiver, denoted by QZ: By the first part of this proof, we know that Z is also a cluster [formula], but not necessarily associated to the same quiver. Denote by RZ the quiver of [formula] associated to Z and μQZ(zi) and μRZ(zi) the new variables created by mutation in direction i of Z in [formula] and in [formula] respectively. Both variables are Laurent polynomials in Z with zi as denominator. More precisely,

[formula]

and

[formula]

As the quiver QZ is acyclic, there exists a unique variable of [formula] with zi as denominator, see theorem 2.2 in [\cite=BMRT07]. This variable is also unique in [formula], hence

[formula]

or

[formula]

As i is arbitrary and Q is connected, it follows that RZ  =  QZ or [formula], see [\cite=ASS12]. Then, R is of type [formula], which proves that cluster algebras of type [formula] are unistructural.

Consequence

Recall the definition of a cluster automorphism from [\cite=ASS12]. Let [formula] be a cluster algebra, and let [formula] be an automorphism of [formula]-algebras. Then f is called a cluster automorphism if there exists a seed (Y,R) of [formula], such that the following conditions are satisfied:

f(Y) is a cluster in [formula];

f is compatible with mutations, that is, for every yk∈Y, we have

[formula]

In [\cite=Sal14], the author defines another notion of automorphism of a cluster algebra: this is an automorphism of the ambient field which restricts to a permutation of the set of cluster variables.

Let [formula] be a cluster algebra of type [formula]. Then [formula] is a cluster automorphism if and only if f is an automorphism of the ambient field which restricts to a permutation of the set of cluster variables.

Lemma 5.2 in [\cite=ASS14] states that this result is true for unistructural cluster algebras. It then follows from Theorem [\ref=yeah].

It is conjectured in [\cite=ASS14] that this result is true for any cluster algebra. Indeed, it would follow from Conjecture [\ref=unisructurality] and Lemma 5.2 in [\cite=ASS14].
