Introduction

For all terms and definitions, not defined specifically in this paper, we refer to [\cite=JAG] [\cite=FH] and and for the topics in signed graphs we refer to [\cite=TZ1] [\cite=TZ2]. Unless mentioned otherwise, all graphs considered here are simple, finite and have no isolated vertices.

An Overview of IASL-Graphs

The sum set (see [\cite=MBN]) of two sets A and B, denoted by A + B, is defined as A + B = {a + b:a∈A,b∈B}. Let [formula] be the set of all non-negative integers and let X be a non-empty subset of X. Using the concepts of sumsets, we have the following notions as defined in [\cite=GS1] [\cite=GS0].

An integer additive set-labeling (IASL, in short) is an injective function [formula] such that the induced function [formula] is defined by [formula]. A graph G which admits an IASL is called an integer additive set-labeled graph (IASL-graph).

An integer additive set-indexer (IASI) is an injective function [formula] such that the induced function [formula] is also injective. A graph G which admits an IASI is called an integer additive set-indexed graph (IASI-graph).

An IASL (or IASI) is said to be k-uniform if |f+(e)|  =  k for all e∈E(G). That is, a connected graph G is said to have a k-uniform IASL (or IASI) if all of its edges have the same set-indexing number k. The cardinality of the set-label of an element (vertex or edge) of a graph G is called the set-indexing number of that element. If the set-labels of all vertices of G have the same cardinality, then the vertex set V(G) is said to be uniformly set-indexed. An element is said to be mono-indexed if its set-indexing number is 1.

A weak integer additive set-labeling of a graph G is an IASI [formula] such that |f+(uv)|  =   max (|f(u)|,|f(v)|) for all u,v∈V(G) and a strong integer additive set-indexer (SIASI) of G is an IASI such that if |f+(uv)|  =  |f(u)|  |f(v)| for all u,v∈V(G).

The following result is a necessary and sufficient condition for a graph to admit a weak IASL.

[\cite=GS3] An IASI f of a given graph G is a weak IASI of G if and only if at least one end vertex of every edge of G is mono-indexed, with respect to f.

[\cite=GS0] A graph G admits a weakly uniform IASL if and only if G is bipartite.

If a graph G has a integer additive set-indexer [formula] such that |f+(uv)| = |f(u) + f(v)| = |f(u)|  |f(v)| for all edges uv of G, then f is said to be a strong IASI of G. A graph which admits a strong IASI is called a strong IASI-graph.

[\cite=GS2] A graph G admits a strong IASI, say f, if and only if for any two adjacent vertices in G, the sets defined by Df(u)  =  {|a - b|:a,b∈f(u)} and Df(v)  =  {|c - d|:c,d∈f(v)} are disjoint.

[\cite=GS2] A connected graph G admits a strongly k-uniform IASL if and only if either G is bipartite or k is a perfect square.

An IASL f of a given graph G is called an arithmetic IASL of G if the elements of the set-labels of the vertices and edges of G are in arithmetic progressions. If all these arithmetic progressions have the same common difference d, then such an arithmetic IASL is called isoarithmetic IASL of G.

[\cite=GS4] If f:V(G)  →  P(X) is an isoarithmetic IASL defined on a graph G, then the cardinality of the set-label of any edge uv in G is |f(u)| + |f(v)| - 1.

Preliminaries on Signed Graphs

Note that a half edge of a graph G is an edge having only one end vertex and a loose edge of G is an edge having no end vertices.

A signed graph (see [\cite=TZ1] [\cite=TZ2]), denoted by Σ(G,σ), is a graph G(V,E) together with a function σ:E(G)  →  { + , - } that assigns a sign, either +   or -  , to each ordinary edge in G. The function σ is called the signature or sign function of Σ, which is defined on all edges except half edges and is required to be positive on free loops.

An edge e of a signed graph Σ is said to be a positive edge if σ(e) =  +  and an edge σ(e) of a signed graph Σ is said to be a negative edge if σ(e) =  - . The set E+ denotes the set of all positive edges in Σ and the set E- denotes the set of negative edges in Σ. A simple cycle (or path) of a signed graph Σ is said to be balanced (see [\cite=AACE] [\cite=FHS]) if the product of signs of its edges is +  . A signed graph is said to be a balanced signed graph if it contains no half edges and all of its simple cycles are balanced.

It is to be noted that the number of all negative signed graph is balanced if and only if it is bipartite.

Balance or imbalance is the fundamental property of a signed graph. The following theorem, popularly known as Harary's Balance Theorem, establishes a criteria for balance in a signed graph.

[\cite=FHS] The following statements about a signed graph are equivalent.

A signed graph Σ is balanced.

Σ has no half edges and there is a partition (V1,V2) of V(Σ) such that E- = E(V1,V2).

Σ has no half edges and any two paths with the same end points have the same sign.

A signed graph Σ is said to be clusterable or partitionable (see [\cite=TZ1] [\cite=TZ2]) if its vertex set can be partitioned into subsets, called clusters, so that every positive edge joins the vertices within the same cluster and every negative edge joins the vertices in the different clusters. If V(Σ) can be partitioned in to k subsets with the above mentioned conditions, then the signed graph Σ is said to be k-clusterable. In this paper, we discuss only the 2-clusterability of signed graphs.

It can be noted that 2-clusterability always implies balance in a signed graph Σ. The converse need not be true. If all edges in Σ are positive edges, then Σ is balanced but not 2-clusterable.

In this paper, we extend the studies on different types of integer additive set-labeling of graphs to classes of signed graphs and hence study the properties and characteristics of such signed graphs.

IASL-Signed Graphs

Motivated from the studies on set-valuations of signed graphs in [\cite=BDAS], and the studies on integer additive set-labeled graphs in [\cite=GS1] [\cite=GS0] [\cite=GS2] [\cite=GS4], we define the notion of an integer additive set-labeling of signed graph as follows.

The structural properties and characteristics of different types IASL-signed graphs are interesting. In the following section, we study the properties of strong IASL-signed graphs.

Strong IASL-Signed Graphs

As stated earlier, balance is the fundamental characteristic of a signed graph and hence let us investigate the conditions required for a strong IASL-signed graph to have the balance property.

The following result provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a balanced signed graph corresponding to a strongly uniform IASL-graph.

A strongly k-uniform IASL-signed graph Σ is balanced if and only if the underlying graph G is a bipartite graph or [formula] is an even integer.

Assume that the strongly k-uniform IASL-signed graph Σ is balanced. Then, for any cycle Cr, σ(Cr) must be positive. Let n1 and n2 be two positive integers greater than 1 such that n1n2 = k. Label, the vertices of Cr alternatively by n1-element subsets and n2-element subsets of the ground set X. Here we have the following cases.

Case-1: Let n1  ≠  n2. We claim that this labeling is possible only when Cr is even. For, if Cr is an odd cycle, then on labeling the vertices of Cr as mentioned above, there will be two adjacent vertices, say u and v both having n1-element set-labels or n2-element set-labels and the edge uv has the set-indexing number n21 (or n22)), which is a contradiction to the fact that G is strongly k-uniform IASL-graph. Therefore, G is bipartite.

Let Cr be an odd cycle in G. Then, we claim that the above mentioned labeling is possible only when n1 = n2. For, if Cr is an odd cycle, as mentioned in Case-1, there exists an edge in Cr with set-indexing number n21 (or n22). Since G admits a strongly k-uniform IASL, we have n21 = k = n1n2. This is true only if [formula]. That is, k is a perfect square. Therefore, every vertex of Cr has the set-indexing number [formula] and every edge of Cr has the set-indexing number k. Since Σ is balanced, we have σ(Cr) =  + , which is possible when k and hence [formula] are even integers.

Conversely, assume that the underlying graph G of strongly k-uniform IASL-signed graph Σ is a bipartite graph or [formula] is an even integer. Then, consider the following cases.

Case-1: Assume that the underlying graph G is a bipartite graph. Then, G has no odd cycles. Let Cr be an arbitrary cycle in G, where r is an even integer. Consider [formula] such that n1n2 = k. Now, label the vertices of G alternatively by n1-element subsets and n2 element subsets of the ground set X such that the labeling becomes a strongly k-uniform IASL of G. Here, we have the following subcases.

Subcase-1.1 If both n1 and n2 are odd integers, then k is odd and hence every edges of the cycle Cr in Σ has the negative sign. Since, Cr has even number of edges, we have σ(Cr) =  + .

Subcase-1.2 If one or both of n1 and n2 is even, then k is even and every edge of Cr has the positive sign. Therefore, σ(Cr) =  + .

Case-2 Assume that G is a non-bipartite graph. By hypothesis, [formula] is an even integer and hence k is also an even integer. Since G is not bipartite, it contains odd cycles. Let Cr be an arbitrary odd cycle in G. Since G admits a strongly k-uniform IASL, every edge of Cr must be labeled by the subsets of X having cardinality [formula] (see [\cite=GS2]). Therefore, every edge of G has positive sign and hence σ(Cr) =  + .

In all the above cases, we can see that the strongly k-uniform IASL-signed graph Σ is balanced.

What are the conditions required for a strongly uniform IASL-signed graph to be clusterable? The following result provides a solution to this problem.

A strongly k-uniform IASL-signed graph Σ is clusterable if and only if the underlying graph G is bipartite and k is an odd integer.

Let Σ is clusterable. Let (U1,U2) be partition of V(Σ) with the required properties of a clustering of Σ. Clearly, k must be odd. For, if k is even all edges of Σ will be positive edges and hence all vertices of Σ belong to either U1 or to U2 making other empty, contradicting the fact that Σ is clusterable. As k is odd, every edge of Σ is a negative edge and hence for any two adjacent vertices in Σ must belong to different partitions. Choose vertices which are pairwise non-adjacent in Σ to form a subset U1 of V(Σ) and Let U2 = V - U1. Clearly, U2 is also a subset of V in which vertices are pairwise disjoint. Therefore, (U1,U2) is a bipartition of the underlying graph G. Hence G is bipartite.

Conversely, assume that the underlying graph G of a strongly k-uniform IASL-signed graph Σ is bipartite graph with bipartition (V1,V2) and k is an odd integer. Therefore, every edge of Σ is a negative edge with one end in V1 and other end in V2. Therefore, (V1,V2) satisfies the properties of a clustering for Σ. Hence, Σ is clusterable.

If the underlying graph G of a strong IASL-signed graph Σ is bipartite, then Σ is balanced if and only if the number of negative edges in Σ in every cycle of G must be even. This is possible only when the number of distinct pairs of adjacent vertices, having odd parity set-labels, in every cycle of Σ must be even. Therefore, we have

Let Σ be a strong IASL- signed graph with the underlying graph G is bipartite. Then, Σ is clusterable if and only if the number of distinct pairs of adjacent vertices having odd parity set-labels is even.

The proof of the above theorem is very obvious. The following result describes the conditions required for the clusterability of (non-uniform) strong IASL-signed graphs whose underlying graph G is a bipartite graph.

The strong IASL-signed graph, whose underlying graph G is a bipartite graph, is clusterable if and only if there exist at least two adjacent vertices in Σf with odd parity set-labels.

Let Σ be a strong IASL-signed graph whose underlying graph G is a bipartite graph. Then, the same IASL of Σ is a strong IASL of G also. Since G is bipartite, every cycle in G is an even cycle. Let [formula] be a cycle in G.

First assume that Σ is clusterable. Then, there exists a partition (U1,U2) of non-empty subsets of V(Σ) such that the edges connecting vertices in the same partition have positive sign and the edges connecting vertices in the different partitions have the negative sign. Note that an edge uv of G has a negative sign only when both u and v have odd parity set-labels. Since G is a connected graph and both sets U1 and U2 are non-empty, there must be at least one edge, say e = uv, in G with one end vertex in U1 and the other end vertex in U2 such that both u and v have odd parity set-labels.

Conversely, assume that at least two adjacent vertices of G have odd parity set-labels. If u and v be two vertices of G having odd cycles in G. Then, σ(uv) =  -  in Σ. Let U1 and U2 be two mutually exclusive subsets of V(G) such that u∈U1 and v∈U2. If there exist other edges, say xy such that both x and y have odd parity set-labels, then include any one of x and y to U1 and all other vertices to U2. Repeat this process until all adjacent pairs of vertices having odd parity set-labels are counted. Then, (U1,U2) will be a partition of Σ with desired properties. Therefore, Σ is clusterable.

Let Σ be a strong IASL- signed graph, whose underlying graph G is a non-bipartite graph. Then G contains some odd cycles. If Cr is an arbitrary odd cycle in G, then Σ is balanced if and only if the number of negative edges in Cr is even, which is possible only when the number of positive edges in Cr is odd. It is possible only when at least two adjacent vertices must have even parity set-labels.

A necessary and sufficient condition for a strong IASL-signed graph to be clusterable is described in the following theorem.

A strong IASL-signed graph Σ is clusterable if and only if every odd cycle of the underlying graph G has at least two adjacent vertices with even parity set-label and at least two adjacent vertices with odd parity set-label.

Let Σ be a strong IASL-signed graph with the underlying graph G, where G is a non-bipartite graph. Then, G contains odd cycles. Let [formula] be a cycle of length r in G.

If Σ is clusterable, there exists a partition of vertices (U1,U2) such that all edges having end vertices in the same partition have positive sign and the edges having end vertices in the different partitions have negative sign. If all vertices of Σ have even parity set-labels, then all edges of Σ will be positive edges. Hence, all vertices of Σ must belong to the same partition, say U1, making the other partition, say U2 empty. If one end vertex of every edge of Σ has even parity set-label, then also all edges of Σ become positive edges. In this case also, all vertices of Σ are in the same partition and the other partition is empty. Hence, there must be at least one edge in Σ such that its both end vertices have odd parity set-labels.

Conversely, assume that every odd cycle, say Cr, contains two adjacent vertices having even parity set-labels. Without loss of generality, let v1 and v2 be the vertices in Cr, which have even parity set-labels. Let v1,v2∈U1. Let all other vertices have odd parity set-labels. Since σ(v2v3) =  + , v3 must also be an element of U1. Since σ(v3v3) =  - , v3∈U2. Proceeding like this, we have [formula] are in U2 and [formula] are in U1. This partition (U1,U2) is a clustering for Σ.

In this context, the questions on the balance and clusterability of weak IASL-signed graphs arouse much interest. In the following section, we discuss certain properties of weak IASL-signed graphs that are similar to those of strong IASL-signed graphs.

Weak IASL-Signed Graphs

Balance and clusterability of the induced signed graphs of weak IASL-graphs has been described in the following theorems.

Analogous to Proposition [\ref=P-BSG-SU], the balance of weakly uniform IASL-signed graph can be described as follows.

A weakly k-uniform IASL-signed graph is always balanced.

Let Σ be a weakly k-uniform IASL-signed graph with the underlying graph G, where k is any positive integer greater than 1. Then, G admits a weakly k-uniform IASL, say f, then f+(e) = k for all e∈G. Then, the signature σ is given by σ(e) = ( - 1)k for all e∈Σ. Therefore, the signs of all edges of Σ are all odd or all even. Since the underlying graph G is a weakly k-uniform IASL-graph, then G is bipartite (see [\cite=GS1]). Therefore, G has no odd cycles. Therefore, the number of signs, positive or negative, of edges in each cycles are even. Therefore, for any cycle Cr in Σ, σ(Cr) is positive. Hence, Σ is balanced.

The following theorem discusses the clusterability of weakly uniform IASL-signed graphs.

A weakly k-uniform IASL-signed graph Σ is clusterable if and only if k is a positive odd integer.

Let the given weakly k uniform IASL-signed graph Σ be clusterable. Then, there exists a partition (U1,U2) of non-empty subsets of V(Σ) such that the end vertices of positive edges belongs to the same partition and the end vertices of negative edges belong to different partitions. If k is even, then all edges in Σ are positive edges and all vertices in Σ belong to the same partition, say U1. Therefore, [formula], which contradicts the hypothesis that Σ is clusterable. Hence, k is an odd integer.

Conversely, assume that k is an odd integer. Then, every edge of G is a negative edge. Then, the bipartition (V1,V2) of the underlying graph G, where V1 is the set of all mono-indexed vertices and V2 is the set of all vertices having set-indexing number k, will form a 2-clustering of Σ. That is, Σ is clusterable.

Balance of a weak IASL-signed graph whose underlying graph is a bipartite graph is discussed in the following result.

A weak IASL-signed graph Σ, whose underlying graph G is a bipartite graph, is balaced if and only if the number of odd parity non-singleton set-labels in every cycle of Σ is even.

Assume that a weak IASL-signed graph Σ is balanced. Note that for the corresponding underlying graph G, the set-indexing number of every edge, not mono-indexed, is the cardinality of the non-singleton set-label of its end vertex. Hence, for every odd parity non-singleton vertex set-labels in Σ, the corresponding edge has a negative sign. Hence, for any cycle Cr in Σ we have σ(Cr) =  +  and this is possible only when the number of odd parity non-singleton vertex set-labels in Cr of Σ must be even.

Conversely, assume that the number of odd parity non-singleton vertex set-labels in any cycle of Σ is even. Therefore, the number of negative edges in Σ is even. Hence, for any cycle Cr in Σ, σ(Cr) =  +  and hence Σ is balanced.

The following theorem establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for a weak IASL-signed graph whose underlying graph is a bipartite graph.

The weak IASL-signed graph Σ, whose underlying graph G is a bipartite graph, is clusterable if and only if there exist some non-singleton vertex set-labels of Σ are of odd parity.

Let G is a bipartite graph with bipartition (V1,V2). Then G need not have any mono-indexed edge. Then, without loss of generality, let V1 contains all mono-indexed vertices and V2 contains all vertices having non-singleton set-labels. Let Σ denotes the corresponding induced signed graph Σ of G.

Assume that some set-labels of the vertices in V2 are of odd parity. Since the mono-indexed vertices in G are not adjacent in G, all vertices in V1 can be in the same cluster U1, if exists. Then, by the definition of clustering, the vertices having even parity set-labels cannot be included in the second cluster U2 as the signs of edges connecting these vertices to the vertices in V1 are positive. Therefore, let [formula] and [formula], where [formula] is the proper subset of all vertices in V2 having even parity set-labels. Clearly, all the edges in the same partition, if exist, have positive signs and the edges connecting the vertices in different partitions have negative sign. That is, G is clusterable.

Conversely, assume that Σ is clusterable. Then, there exists a partition (U1,U2) of the vertex set V(Σ) such that all edges connecting the vertices in the same partition have the positive sign and the edges connecting the vertices in different partitions have negative sign. Let U1 contains all vertices in V1. Any vertex u in V2, having an even parity set label and adjacent to some vertex v in V1 must also belong to U1 as σ(uv) =  + . Hence, if the set-labels of all vertices in V2 are of even parity, then [formula], which is a contradiction to the hypothesis that Σ is clusterable. Therefore, the set-labels of some vertices in V2 are of odd parity.

In this context, it is much interesting to check the balance property of weak IASL-signed graphs whose underlying graphs are non-bipartite. Hence, we have the following theorem.

A weak IASL-signed graph Σ, whose underlying graph G is a non-bipartite graph, is not balanced.

Since G is a non-bipartite graph, G contains odd cycles. Let Cr be an odd cycle in G. If Σ is balanced, then the number of negative edges in Cr must be even. When one vertex, say v, of G has an even parity set-label, then the two edges incident on it will have the positive sign and the remaining odd number of edges in Cr have negative signs. If u and v are two adjacent vertices in Cr, then the three edges incident on these two vertices become positive and the number of negative edges in Cr becomes even. Therefore, if G is balanced, then at least two adjacent vertices must have even parity set-labels. This contradicts the fact that G admits a weak IASL. Hence, Σ is not balanced.

The following result is a straight forward implication of the above theorem.

A weak IASL-signed graph Σ, whose underlying graph G is non-bipartite, is not clusterable.

For any signed graph Σ, we have 2-clusterability implies the balance in Σ. But by Theorem [\ref=Thm-2.13], a weak IASL-signed graph Σ, whose underlying graph is non-bipartite, can not be a balanced signed graph. Hence, the weak IASL-signed graph Σ is not clusterable.

Another interesting type IASL-signed graph is the signed graph which admits an isoarithmetic IASL. In the following section, we discuss the properties of these types of signed graphs.

Isoarithmetic IASL-Signed Graphs

The following theorem describes a necessary and sufficient condition for an isoarithmetic IASL-signed graph to be balanced.

An isoarithmetic IASL-signed graph Σ is balanced if and only if every cycle in Σ has even number of distinct pairs of adjacent vertices having the same parity set-labels.

Let Σ be a an isoarithmetic IASL-signed graph. Then, for every edge uv in E(Σ), the cardinality of the set-label of uv is |f+(uv)| = |f(u)| + |f(v)| - 1. Therefore, |f+(uv)| is odd if both f(u) and f(v) are of the same parity and |f+(uv)| is even if f(u) and f(v) are of different parities.

Assume that Σ is balanced. Then, the number of negative edges in every cycle of Σ must be even, the number of disjoint pairs of adjacent vertices having the same parity set-labels must be even.

Conversely, assume that the number of disjoint pairs of adjacent vertices in every cycle Cr of Σ having the same parity set-labels must be even. Then, the number of negative edges in Cr is even. Therefore, Σ is balanced.

What are the conditions required for an isoarithmetic IASL-signed graph to be clusterable? The following result provides the required conditions in this regard.

An isoarithmetic IASL-signed graph Σ is clusterable if and only if Σ contains some disjoint pairs of adjacent vertices having the same parity set-labels.

Note that a connected signed graph Σ clusterable, if and only if Σ must have negative edges connecting the vertices in different partitions. Hence, if an isoarithmetic IASL-graph Σ is clusterable, then Σ contains negative edges which is possible when some disjoint pairs of adjacent vertices in Σ must have the same parity set-labels.

Conclusion

In this paper, we discussed the characteristics and properties of the induced signed graphs of certain IASL-graphs with a prime focus on clusterability and balance of these signed graphs. There are several open problems in this area. Some of the open problems that seem to be promising for further investigations are following.

Further studies on other characteristics of signed graphs corresponding to different IASL-graphs are also interesting and challenging. All these facts highlight the scope for further studies in this area.
