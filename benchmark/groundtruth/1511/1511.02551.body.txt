Backward Iteration Algorithms for Julia sets of Möbius Semigroups

Introduction

In this paper we consider the dynamics of rational semigroups (i.e., semigroups of rational maps on the Riemann sphere [formula] where the semigroup operation is the composition of maps). In particular, we consider the algorithm to draw the figures of the Julia sets of finitely generated Möbius semigroups (i.e., semigroups of Möbius maps on [formula]). In [\cite=RandomBackStankewitzSumi] two methods for generating graphical computer approximations of Julia sets of finitely generated rational semigroups were discussed, the full backward iteration algorithm and the random backward iteration algorithm. The former method was justified by the work of Boyd [\cite=Boyd2] and later generalized by Sumi [\cite=Su3], and the latter method was justified by the present authors in [\cite=RandomBackStankewitzSumi]. (See also [\cite=BarnsleyDemko] where these methods were first explored.) However, because of complexities that do not exist when there is a map of degree two or more, neither method was verified for classes of Möbius semigroups in these papers. The goal of the present paper, however, is to verify both methods for certain classes of Möbius semigroups (see Theorems [\ref=FullMethod] and [\ref=main] for precise statements).

The full backward iteration algorithm creates successive approximations to the Julia set as follows. Starting with a seed value [formula], the set A1 of all preimages of z0 under all generating maps of the semigroup is constructed. Iteratively, the set An is constructed to be the set of all preimages of all points in An - 1 under all generating maps. In general, for large n the set An approximates the Julia set of the semigroup (see precise statements in Section 2 where the An's are exactly the supports of a corresponding convergent sequence of measures).

The random backward iteration algorithm (also known as the "ergodic method" or "chaos game" method) creates successive approximations to the Julia set as follows. Starting with a seed value [formula] and a random walk {zn} is generated by setting zn to be the outcome of randomly selecting one preimage of zn - 1 under a randomly selected generating map. In general, the plotted points of this random walk then will give a visual approximation to the Julia set of the semigroup (see precise statements in Section 3 given in terms of convergence of certain measures).

Analogous results, for both the "full" and "random" methods, in the context of attractor sets for contracting iterated function systems (see [\cite=Hutchinson] [\cite=BEH] [\cite=Elton] [\cite=RSThesis]) and Julia sets of a iterated single rational functions (see [\cite=HawkinsTaylor] [\cite=Lyu] [\cite=Mane] [\cite=FLM]) are known. Both the full and random methods for both attractor sets of iterated function systems and Julia sets of rational semigroups are implemented using the freely available application Julia 2.0 [\cite=Julia2.0].

We now introduce the basic terminology and notions needed to describe the full and random methods mentioned above.

For the entire paper we let [formula] be a rational semigroup generated by Möbius maps fj where the semigroup operation is composition of functions, i.e., G is the collections of all maps which can be expressed as a finite composition of maps from the generating set [formula]. Also, since the results depend not on just the semigroup G but also on the particular choice of generators, we assume each such semigroup comes with a particular fixed generating set of maps.

Research on the dynamics of rational semigroups was initiated by Hinkkanen and Martin in [\cite=HM1], and this remains a primary source for background information. However, they studied only rational semigroups containing at least one element of degree at least two. For an in depth look at the dynamics of Möbius semigroups see [\cite=FMS].

We follow [\cite=HM1] in saying that the Fatou set F(G) is the set of points in [formula] which have a neighborhood on which G is normal, and its complement in [formula] is called the Julia set J(G).

We quote the following results from [\cite=HM1]. The Fatou set F(G) is forward invariant under each element of G, i.e., g(F(G))  ⊆  F(G) for all g∈G, and thus J(G) is backward invariant under each element of G, i.e., g- 1(J(G))  ⊆  J(G) for all g∈G. We note that the sets F(G) and J(G) are, however, not necessarily completely invariant under the elements of G.

We define the kernal Julia set of G by [formula].

The exceptional set E(G) is defined to be the set of points z with a finite backward orbit [formula].

We record the following well-known facts for later use.

Jker(G) is the largest forward invariant subset of J(G) under the action of G.

For [formula] we have [formula]. In particular, for [formula] we have [formula].

G(E(G))  =  E(G).

If #  J(G)  ≥  3, then J(G) is both perfect (thus uncountable) and the closure of the set of points that are repelling fixed points under any map in G.

(1) follows from the definition of Jker(G) and the fact that J(G) is backward invariant under G. (2) is shown in [\cite=HM1]. Because E(G) is clearly backward invariant, (3) follows from Proposition 2.17 in [\cite=FMS] when E(G) is finite. Now suppose E(G) is infinite. Since any three points in E(G) must have finite backward orbits under each g∈G, we must then have each g  ≠  Id in G is elliptic of finite order. This implies then that g- 1∈G for each g∈G and thus G = G- 1. Hence E(G) which is backward invariant under G must also be forward invariant under G. (4) is shown in [\cite=StankewitzRepelDense2].

Full backward iteration algorithm

Let [formula] be fixed. For each [formula], we write [formula]. Note that [formula] depends on the initial choice of a though we suppress this dependence in our notation.

Throughout we assume [formula] is a probability vector, i.e., each bj > 0 and [formula].

Denoting by δz the unit point mass measure at z, we define probability measures μa,bn on [formula] as follows:

[formula]

and, in general, for n > 1

[formula]

Following [\cite=Boyd2] and [\cite=Su3], we define a bounded linear operator T = TbG on the space [formula] of continuous functions (endowed with the sup norm [formula]) on [formula] by

[formula]

noting [formula]. Hence, (Tφ)(z) is a weighted average of φ evaluated at all k preimages of z under all generators fj.

Letting [formula] denote the space of probability Borel measures on [formula], and noting that it is a compact metric space in the topology of weak* convergence, we have that the adjoint [formula] of Tb is given by

[formula]

for all Borel sets [formula]. Using the operator notation [formula] we express the action of the adjoint as 〈Tφ,ρ〉  =  〈φ,T*ρ〉. Note that the map [formula] given by z  ↦  μz,b1 is continuous since for a sequence zn  →  z0 in [formula], we have 〈φ,μzn,b1〉  =  (Tφ)(zn)  →  (Tφ)(z0) = 〈φ,μz0,b1〉 for any [formula], i.e., μzn,b1  →  μz,b1.

We give a claim which is obtained by using results from [\cite=SumiRandom].

Let [formula] be a Möbius semigroup and let [formula] be a probability vector. When [formula] and [formula], we have the following (a)(b)(c)(d)(e).

(a) [formula]

(b) There exists a unique minimal set L of G, where we say that a non-empty compact subset L of [formula] is a minimal set of G if [formula] for each z∈L.

(c) [formula]

(d) [formula]

(e) Let b be a probability vector. Then there exists a unique Borel probability measure μb on [formula] such that [formula] uniformly on [formula], where, M = MbG is the transition operator with respect to b given by [formula], for any [formula]. Also, μb is the unique Borel probability measure on [formula] such that [formula] Also, the support of μb is equal to L.

We now apply parts (2), (3), (8), (10), (13), (17), and (21) of Theorem 3.15 in [\cite=SumiRandom] using the probability measure [formula] on the space of non-constant rational functions. Part (a) follows from (3). From (a) and Proposition [\ref=facts](4) there exists a loxodromic map in G and hence (b) follows from (21). If (c) did not hold, then L  ⊆  J(G) would be contained in Jker(G) contradicting our assumption. Part (d) follows from (17) noting that the Sτ in the reference is L in this case. Lastly, (e) follows from (2), (8), (10), (13), and (21).

We note that the complexities involved in the proof of Theorem 3.15 of [\cite=SumiRandom] required a very delicate analysis based on the hyperbolic metric in this general setting (see Remark [\ref=Delicate]). Now, we prove the following.

Let G be a Mobius semigroup such that [formula] and [formula] Then, the unique minimal set L of G is equal to J(G- 1).

By (d) in Claim [\ref=SumiClaim], we have L  ⊆  J(G- 1) since any attracting fixed point of any g∈G must be a repelling fixed point of g- 1.

We now consider the following two cases. Case (i) [formula]. Case (ii) [formula].

Suppose we have case (i). Then G(L)  ⊆  L (thus (G- 1)- 1(L)  ⊆  L), [formula] Since J(G- 1) is a minimal backward invariant compact subset under G- 1 which has at least three elements, we obtain that L  ⊇  J(G- 1). Hence L = J(G- 1).

Suppose we have case (ii). By (c) in Claim [\ref=SumiClaim] we choose [formula]. Since #  L  <    +    ∞   and F(G) is forward invariant under G, we see that [formula] By (a) in Claim [\ref=SumiClaim], we can take hyperbolic distance on each connected component of F(G) and for a small ε > 0 let Vε be the ε-hyperbolic neighborhood of L (We consider connected components {Wi} of F(G) which meet L and we consider the ε-hyperbolic neighborhood Ai,ε of [formula] in Wi and let [formula].) Then [formula] by Pick's Lemma and hence [formula] Since ε is an arbitrary small number, it follows that J(G- 1)  ⊆  L. Hence J(G- 1) = L.

Note that replacing the maps fj by their inverses f- 1j in the definition of the operator M of Claim [\ref=SumiClaim] produces the operator T given in [\eqref=Tdef]. Hence for a Möbius semigroup G we see that MbG- 1 = TbG, where [formula] is the inverse semigroup of G. Thus applying Claim [\ref=SumiClaim] and Lemma  [\ref=Lset] to the inverse semigroup G- 1 we have the following result which parallels results for non-Möbius rational semigroups found in [\cite=Boyd2] [\cite=Su3] [\cite=BarnsleyDemko].

Let [formula] be a Möbius semigroup and let [formula] be a probability vector. Suppose [formula] and [formula] Then the measures μa,bn converge weakly to a Borel probability measure μb  =  μbG on [formula] independently of and uniform in [formula]. Further, the support of μb is J(G) and T*bμb  =  μb. Further, μb is the unique Borel probability measure on [formula] such that [formula].

Theorem [\ref=FullMethod] provides the justification for the "full backward iteration algorithm" used to graphically approximate J(G). This method simply plots the kn (not necessarily distinct) points in the support of μa,bn. We note that this iterative process plots all k inverses of each of the kn - 1 points in the support of μa,bn - 1 to generate the support of μa,bn. Also, note that the support of μa,bn is independent of b (but not of a), which merely adjusts the weights on the point masses.

Random backward iteration algorithm

Let [formula] denote the space of one-sided sequences on k symbols, regarded with the usual topology and σ-algebra of Borel sets. Now let Pb be the Bernoulli measure on Σ+k which is then given on basis elements as follows: for fixed jn for [formula], we have [formula].

Let us define a random walk as follows. Starting at a point [formula], we note that there are k preimages of a under the generators of the semigroup G. We randomly select z1 to be f- 1j(a) with probability bj. Likewise, z2 is randomly selected to be one of the k preimages of z1. Continue in this fashion to generate what we call a random backward orbit {zn} of z0 = a under the semigroup G.

Utilizing the notation introduced in Section [\ref=SectionFull], we see that Σ+k generates the entire set of backward orbits starting at z0 = a by letting the sequence [formula] generate the backward orbit [formula].

Formally, we define our random walk {zn} in terms of random variables {Zn} given as follows. For each [formula], we let [formula] by [formula] and [formula]. Hence, [formula].

The proof given for the analogous result in [\cite=RandomBackStankewitzSumi] shows the following.

Let [formula] be a Möbius semigroup, let [formula], and let [formula] be a probability vector. Then the stochastic process [formula] forms a Markov process with transition probabilities {μz,b1}, i.e., for each Borel set [formula] we have [formula].

The main result can now be stated in terms of the probability measures, defined for each [formula] and [formula], by

[formula]

Let [formula] be a Möbius semigroup, let [formula], and let [formula] be a probability vector. Suppose [formula] and [formula] Then, for Pb a.a. [formula], the probability measures [formula] converge weakly to μb in [formula].

By using Theorem [\ref=FullMethod], the proof of Theorem [\ref=main] is now nearly identical with that given for the proof of the analogous result in [\cite=RandomBackStankewitzSumi], but is given in Appendix [\ref=AppProof] of this paper for completeness.

Theorem [\ref=main] provides the justification for the "random backward iteration algorithm" used to graphically approximate J(G). This method simply plots, for large n, the n points in the support of [formula], i.e., the points of a random backward orbit, where [formula] is randomly selected according to Pb. If a∉J(G), then it is often appropriate to not plot the first hundred or so points in the random backward orbit since the earlier points in the orbit might not be very close to J(G).

By Claim [\ref=SumiClaim] and [\cite=SumiRandom], we can show the following result.

Under the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=main], let [formula] and let [formula] be a probability vector. Then for Pb a.a. [formula], we have [formula] as n  →    ∞  .

By Claim [\ref=SumiClaim], there exists a unique minimal set L of G- 1. By [\cite=SumiRandom], the statement of our theorem holds.

Consequences of the main result Theorem [\ref=main]

Using Theorem [\ref=main] together with the fact that the support of μb is J(G) no matter what probability vector b is chosen, one can quickly show the following results. Under the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=main], for each [formula] and for each probability vector b, let [formula] Note that by Theorem [\ref=main], we have Pb(Σa,b) = 1. Nearly identical details of the argument can be found in [\cite=HawkinsTaylor] and so we omit them here.

Under the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=main], let [formula] and [formula], where the union is taken over all probability vectors b. Then

[formula]

Furthermore, if a∈J(G), then

[formula]

Meeting the conclusion of this corollary is generally what one is looking for when saying that the "random backward iteration" method works in drawing (an approximation of) J(G). Note that this conclusion holds for Pb a.a. [formula], regardless of the choice of b.

Applications

In this section, we give some examples to which we can apply Theorems [\ref=FullMethod], [\ref=main], [\ref=converge] and Corollary [\ref=Closure]. For Möbius semigroups S, we give some sufficient conditions for Jker (S) to be empty.

Let S be a Möbius semigroup and S- 1 its inverse semigroup. Assume [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula].

Choose [formula].

Then for all [formula] we see [formula] must contain z0 by Proposition [\ref=facts][\eqref=BackOrbitNonExcept]. Therefore for all [formula], we have [formula] meets F(S) since [formula].

For z∈E(S- 1), since S(E(S- 1))  =  E(S- 1) by Proposition [\ref=facts][\eqref=ExcSetCompInv] we see that the assumption [formula] gives that S(z)  ⊆  E(S- 1)  ⊂  F(S).

So, for all [formula] we have [formula] meets F(S). Thus [formula] since Jker(S) is a forward invariant subset of J(S).

Let S be a Möbius semigroup and suppose that [formula], [formula], and int[formula], where int denotes the set of interior points with respect to the topology in [formula] Then [formula]

Suppose J(S- 1)  ⊃  J(S). Since S- 1(J(S))  ⊂  J(S), we have S- 1((J(S)))  ⊂  (J(S)). Since [formula], Montel's theorem implies that (J(S))  ⊂  F(S- 1). However, this is a contradiction. Thus we have [formula] By Lemma [\ref=Lemma1], we obtain that [formula]

Let S be a Möbius semigroup and S- 1 its inverse semigroup. Assume #  J(S)  ≥  3 and [formula]. Then [formula].

Suppose w∈Jker(S). Using Proposition [\ref=facts][\eqref=RepelDense] we may choose g∈S such that g has a repelling fixed point p  ≠  w. So g has an attracting fixed point q which must then be in J(S- 1). Hence q∉J(S). Since gn(w)  →  q we contradict the fact that Jker(S) is both a closed forward invariant set under S and contained in J(S).

We apply the above results to the Caruso semigroups Sβ defined as follows. For a fixed nonzero complex number β we let f(z) = β  +  1 / z and g(z) =  - β  +  1 / z. We define the Möbius semigroup Sβ  =  〈f,g〉, and its inverse semigroup Sβ' = 〈f- 1,g- 1〉. See [\cite=FMS] for background, but note that there the notation is different in that Möbius groups are denoted by [formula] and semigroups are denoted [formula]. We note that in Section 7 of [\cite=FMS] it is shown that neither Sβ nor Sβ' have finite orbits in [formula] and so, in particular, [formula] and [formula]. Further it is shown that #  J(Sβ)  ≥  3 and #  J(Sβ')  ≥  3.

For each [formula] we have either

(i) J(Sβ)  ≠  J(Sβ') and [formula]

or

(ii) J(Sβ)  =  J(Sβ') and Jker(Sβ)  =  J(Sβ)  =  J(Sβ')  =  Jker(Sβ').

From Proposition 7.14 of [\cite=FMS], J(Sβ)  ≠  J(Sβ') implies both [formula] and [formula]. Hence by Lemma [\ref=Lemma1] the result follows (noting that J(Sβ)  =  J(Sβ') implies J(Sβ) is both forward and backward invariant under Sβ and thus Jker(Sβ)  =  J(Sβ)  =  J(Sβ')  =  Jker(Sβ')).

Hence whenever J(Sβ)  ≠  J(Sβ') we see by Theorem [\ref=main] (noting #  J(Sβ)  ≥  3 and #  J(Sβ')  ≥  3) that both the random backward iteration algorithm and the full backward iteration algorithm work for both Sβ and Sβ', and these method can start with any seed value [formula]. This is an extension from what was shown in [\cite=FMS]. In particular, Theorem 5.7 in [\cite=FMS] shows that for any finitely generated Möbius semigroup S the following (i)-(iii) are equivalent: (i) S has a thick attractor J(S- 1), (ii) S- 1 has a thick attractor J(S), and (iii) [formula] and the generators of S are loxodromic (having a repelling fixed point). Noted in [\cite=FMS], when a thick attractor exists both the (forward) random walk method and the (forward) full method work for drawing the corresponding Julia sets, however, the initial seed value must be chosen from the set K* given in the definition of thick attractor.

Theorem [\ref=main] presented here is not so restrictive as Theorem 5.7 in [\cite=FMS] on the conditions that [formula] nor on the choice of starting seed value. This, however, required a more delicate analysis as conducted in the proof of Theorem 3.15 in [\cite=SumiRandom] which was crucial in the proof of Theorem [\ref=main].

Concrete examples where Theorem [\ref=main] applies, but the result of [\cite=FMS] does not, are for β  =    ±  1  ±  i where (see Theorem 8.2 in [\cite=FMS]), J(Sβ) and J(Sβ') are unequal Cantor sets with [formula] Other examples of this type are for β  =    ±  2 or β  =    ±  2i, where (see Theorem 8.1 in [\cite=FMS]) J(Sβ) and J(Sβ') are unequal Cantor sets with [formula]

We give further examples of Möbius semigroups G with [formula] to which we can apply Theorems [\ref=FullMethod], [\ref=main], [\ref=converge] and Corollary [\ref=Closure].

Denoting the open unit disk by [formula] with boundary [formula], let [formula] be Möbius maps with [formula] for each [formula] chosen such that for [formula] we have [formula]. (For example, any parabolic fixed points of any g∈G would necessarily lie in [formula]. Also, if [formula] is a Fuchsian group with [formula], then [formula]) Note that J(G)  ⊆  S and J(G- 1)  ⊆  S. Set fk + 1(z) = az with |a| > 1 and call [formula]. Since [formula] is forward invariant under [formula] we must have [formula]. Similarly, [formula]. In this way since J(G)  ⊂  J() and J(G- 1)  ⊂  J(- 1), we have that [formula] contains [formula], which could be constructed to be a rather large subset of S. However, Theorems [\ref=FullMethod], [\ref=main], [\ref=converge] and Corollary [\ref=Closure] still apply.

We conclude this paper with the following:

Is [formula] open and dense in [formula]?

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

In this section we introduce a key result of Furstenberg and Kifer to relate the invariance of the measure μb to the convergence of Cesaro averages of φ(zn) where {zn} is a random backward orbit and [formula]. As in [\cite=HawkinsTaylor] [\cite=RandomBackStankewitzSumi], this result is the key tool in the proof of our main theorem.

Let M be a compact metric space and let P(M) be the space of Borel probability measures on M, noting that P(M) is a compact metric space in the topology of weak* convergence. Suppose there exists a continuous map M  →  P(M) assigning to each x∈M a measure μx. The corresponding Markov operator [formula] is given by

[formula]

Suppose the stochastic process [formula] is a Markov process corresponding to H, i.e., [formula].

Given these assumptions we then have the following, which is a weaker version (but sufficient for our purposes) of Theorem 1.4 in [\cite=FurstKifer].

Assume that there is a unique probability measure ν on M that is invariant under the adjoint operator H* on P(M) and let φ∈C(M). Then with probability one

[formula]

as N  →    ∞  .

Let [formula]. We apply Theorem [\ref=FKtheorem] using [formula], μx  =  μz,b1, H = T, ν  =  μb and Xn  =  Zn, noting that all the hypotheses have been met by Theorem [\ref=FullMethod] and Claim [\ref=Markov]. Thus we obtain a set Σφ  ⊆  Σ+d with Pb(Σφ) = 1 such that for all [formula] we have

[formula]

Since the set Σφ depends on φ, we require an extra step to achieve single such set to work for all maps in [formula].

Since [formula] is compact we know that [formula] is separable. Let {φj} be dense in [formula]. Let [formula] and note that Pb(Σ0) = 1. Let ψ∈C(K). Let ε > 0. Select φj such that [formula]. Then for all [formula], we have [formula] for large n.

Hence on Σ0 we get the convergence we seek, for all ψ∈C(K) and this completes the proof.
