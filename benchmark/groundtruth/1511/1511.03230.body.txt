On the distribution of numbers related to the divisors of xn - 1

Introduction

Cyclotomic polynomials arise naturally as irreducible divisors of xn - 1. The polynomial xn - 1 can be factored in the following way

[formula]

Applying Mobius inversion we get

[formula]

The problem of determining size of maximum coefficient of cyclotomic polynomials has been the subject of the papers [\cite=B] and [\cite=E]. In [\cite=D] Pomerance and Ryan study the size of maximum coefficient of divisors of xn - 1.

It has been proven that for every finite sequence of integers (ni)ri = 1 , there exists [formula], a divisor of xn - 1 for some [formula], such that ci = ni for 1  ≤  i  ≤  r. In this paper we investigate the following problem. For a given sequence (ni)ri = 1, let [formula] denote the set of all n such that xn - 1 has a divisor d(x) of the form [formula]. We prove that [formula] has a natural density. Observe that if [formula] then every multiple of n is in [formula].

Notation

If f(x) and g(x) are two analytic functions in some neighborhood of 0, we denote [formula] if the coefficients of xi in the power series of f(x) and g(x) are equal for 0  ≤  i  ≤  r.

We denote ω(n) for number of distinct prime factors of n. Let δ(d) be 1 if d  ≠  1 and δ(d) be - 1 otherwise. Note that

[formula]

Proof of Main Theorem

We require several lemmas in order to prove that [formula] has a natural density.

The proof that there exists a sequence [formula] is by induction on r. If r = 1 and [formula] then [formula] hence the existence part of lemma is true for r = 1. If we assume that the existence part of lemma is true for r, then for any sequence of r + 1 integers (ni)r + 1i = 1, there exist r integers [formula] such that

[formula]

Let n'r + 1 be an integer such that

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Hence the existence part of the lemma is true for r + 1.

For the uniqueness part, if there are two finite sequences [formula] and [formula] such that

[formula]

If the two sequences are distinct then let i be the least index such that ki - k'i  ≠  0 then we have

[formula]

or

[formula]

which implies ki - k'i = 0 contradicting the assumption that [formula].

For a given sequence [formula] we proved that there exists a unique sequence [formula] such that equation ([\ref=equation_1]) is true. Let [formula] be the set defined by [formula]. If the set [formula] is non empty let [formula] be the least common multiple of elements of [formula], otherwise let [formula] be 1.

We will prove that if [formula] then [formula]. If [formula] does not divide n then there exists an [formula] such that [formula]. That is, [formula] and [formula].

Any divisor d(x) of xn - 1 such that d(0) = 1 will be of the form

[formula]

where S is some subset of set of divisors of n. Hence

[formula]

where [formula] for 1  ≤  m  ≤  r. Therefore as [formula], li = 0. Hence [formula] and from uniqueness part of Lemma [\ref=Lemma_1] we have [formula]. Hence [formula].

For every divisor d' of d we have [formula] From equation (2)

[formula]

From (2) we have

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=Lemma_1] we have [formula] where [formula]. From the definition of [formula], ki  ≠  0 if and only if [formula]. Let [formula] be the elements of [formula]. We have

[formula]

Let [formula] for 1  ≤  j  ≤  p be numbers such that for 1  ≤  a  ≤  |kij1| and 1  ≤  b  ≤  |kij2|, r(j1)a = r(j2)b if and only if j1 = j2 and a = b. If kij > 0 then r(j)a is a product of two distinct primes and each prime factor of r(j)a is greater than r. If kij < 0 then r(j)a is a prime number greater than r.

If kij > 0 then let

[formula]

If kij > 0 then as r(j)m is a product two prime factors greater from Lemma [\ref=Lemma_5] we have [formula] Therefore

[formula]

Hence from ([\ref=equation_3]) we have

[formula]

If kij < 0 let

[formula]

As kij < 0, r(j)m is a prime number greater than r. Hence

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

From ([\ref=equation_2]), ([\ref=equation_4]) and ([\ref=equation_5]) we have

[formula]

If the set {ijr(j)m:1  ≤  j  ≤  p,1  ≤  m  ≤  |kij|} is non empty, let n be the least common multiple of the elements of the set and let n = 1 if the set is empty. Clearly d(x) is a divisor of xn - 1 and therefore [formula]. Observe that n is of the form [formula] where qi's are distinct prime factors greater than r.

For brevity, let [formula] and [formula]. From Lemma [\ref=Lemma_4] there exists an m1 of the form [formula] and a divisor d1(x) of xm1 - 1 such that

[formula]

For every m2 of the form [formula] such that [formula] are distinct primes greater than r. Let S1 be the set of divisors of m1 and S2 be the set of divisors of m2. Let g:S1  →  S2 be a map defined as follows. As l and [formula] are relatively prime, every divisor of d of [formula] can be uniquely written in the form [formula] where d'1 divides l. Define [formula]. From Lemma [\ref=Lemma_3] it follows that [formula]. As d1(x) is of the form [formula] where R1 is a subset of S1 there will be [formula], a divisor of xm2 - 1, and [formula]. Therefore every number of the form [formula] where pi's are distinct primes greater than r belongs to S which implies that every number lm belongs to S, if number of distinct prime factors of m greater than r is at least k. Hence if ω(m)  ≥  r + k then lm∈S as ω(m)  ≥  r + k implies that number of prime factors of m greater than r is at least k. From 3.1. Lemma B of [\cite=C]

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=Lemma_2], if n∈S then l|n which implies that [formula]. Combining the two inequalities we get

[formula]

which completes the proof of the theorem.
