Euler characteristic numbers of space-like manifolds

Introduction

Let Mn be a compact even dimensional Riemannian manifold with negative sectional curvature. A long-standing conjecture due to H. Hopf[\cite=hopf25] in differential geometry asks whether the Euler characteristic number of Mn satisfies [formula]. When n = 4, the proof was given by Chern[\cite=chern55] (who attributed the result to Milnor) by showing the integrand of Gauss-Bonnet-Chern is positive. However, when n = 6, some examples show that the integrand does not have a definite sign in general. On the other hand, Gromov in [\cite=gro91] proved that Hopf conjecture is true when the manifold is Kähler.

In this note, we will consider the Euler characteristic numbers of a class of real Riemannian manifolds. These manifolds are locally embeddable in Lorentz-Minkowski space Rn,1. In [\cite=zhang09], such Nn is called space-like. More precisely, we call a manifold (Nn,g) (see [\cite=zhang09]) space-like if there exists a symmetric (0,2) tensor hij such that the following two equations are fulfilled

[formula]

[formula]

Here the sign convention for the Riemann curvature tensor Rijkl is made so that Rijij is positive on sphere. Clearly, a space-like n-dimensional submanifold of Rn,1 satisfies the above two equations (1.1) and (1.2) if we take the tensor hij to be the second fundamental form. A space-like manifold shares some interesting properties of manifolds with non-positive curvature. For example, it can be shown that the universal cover of a space-like manifold is diffeomorphic to the Euclidean space (see Corollary[\ref=cor2.2]). The main result of this note is the following theorem:

Let Mn be an even dimensional Riemannian manifolds with negative sectional curvature. Suppose Mn is homotopic to some compact space-like manifold Nn. Then the Euler characteristic number of Mn satisfies

[formula]

Note that in the theorem, we do not assume the curvature of space-like manifold Nn has a sign. The curvature sign is only imposed on the manifold Mn. The motivation for the proof of Theorem 1.1 is from [\cite=zhang09], where the second author studied the hyperbolization problem of space-like manifolds by using the so-called intrinsic mean curvature flow. More precisely, it was shown in [\cite=zhang09] that if the manifold is compact and hij > 0, then the manifold admits a Riemannian metric of negative constant sectional curvature.

Theorem 1.1 follows from a more general result on space-like manifolds satisfying (1.1) and (1.2):

Let Nn be an even dimensional compact space-like manifold, then the Euler characteristic number satisfies

[formula]

The equality holds if and only if the minimal volume of Nn is zero.

According to Gromov[\cite=gro82], the minimal volume of a manifold Nn is the infimum of all volumes vol(Nn,g'), where g' ranges over all Riemannian metrics with sectional curvatures satisfying |Kg'|  ≤  1. The minimal volume conjecture of Gromov [\cite=gro82] is asking whether there is a number ε(n) depending only on the dimension n such that min vol(Nn) < ε(n) implies min vol (Nn) = 0. This conjecture was already verified by X. C. Rong[\cite=rong93] in dimension 4. A byproduct of Theorem [\ref=thm2] is

The minimal volume conjecture is true for all compact even dimensional space-like manifolds.

The proof of above Theorems [\ref=thm1] and [\ref=thm2] is an elementary application of the mean curvature flow. The detail will be given in the following two sections.

Mean curvature flow

In this section, we assume that (Nn,g) is a space-like manifold, i.e. there is a tensor hij such that equation ([\ref=ge]) and ([\ref=ce]) hold. In [\cite=zhang09], the second author studied the following flow:

[formula]

It was shown in [\cite=zhang09], when (Nn,g) is compact, equation ([\ref=e2.1]) admits a smooth solution for any initial data (g0,h0). Moreover, if equations ([\ref=ge]) and ([\ref=ce]) hold at time t = 0, then they also continue to hold for time t > 0. That is to say, (Nn,g(t),h(t)) will remain to be a space-like manifold under the deformation ([\ref=e2.1]). In this case, equation ([\ref=e2.1]) may be simplified:

[formula]

where H = gijhij,|A|2 = gijgklhikhjl.

We may call equation ([\ref=e2.1]) an intrinsic mean curvature flow. Equations ([\ref=ge]) and ([\ref=ce]) may be called Gauss and Codazzi equations respectively.

Another approach to solve equation ([\ref=e2.1]) or ([\ref=e2.2]) is to embed the universal cover (Ñ,) into Rn,1 as a space-like submanifold Σ in the usual sense, deform Σ in Rn,1 by the mean curvature flow and prove the mean curvature flow is invariant under the deck transformation.

Ñ admits an isometric embedding into Rn,1 as a space-like submanifold with second fundamental form hij given in ([\ref=ge]) and ([\ref=ce]).

By a monodromy argument, there is a smooth isometric immersion φ:(Ñ,)  →  Rn,1 with hij as the second fundamental form. Let π:Rn,1  →  Rn be the projection to an n-coordinate plane, and [formula]. Let g0 be the Euclidean metric in Rn, then it is not hard to see   ≤  ψ*g0. This implies ψ is proper, hence a covering map to Rn. From this, we know φ is an embedding.

The universal cover Ñ is diffeomorphic to the Euclidean space.

Now let (Nn,g) be a compact space-like manifold, we deform (g,h) by ([\ref=e2.1]) or ([\ref=e2.2]).

From ([\ref=e2.2]), it is not hard to show

[formula]

where [formula]

Based on ([\ref=e2.3]), it can be shown that the solution (g(t),h(t)) of equation ([\ref=e2.1]) (or ([\ref=e2.2])) always exists for all time 0  ≤  t <   ∞  , and hij satisfies the estimate

[formula]

In the following propositions, we assume the dimension n to be even.

First, we derive two monotonicity formulas for the intrinsic mean curvature flow. We have to mention that all the quantities in the following propositions involving the norm and the volume element dv are computed at time t with the evolving metric g(t).

and

The proof is direct calculations by using equations ([\ref=e2.3]).

There are constant C0 > 0 and a sequence of times tk  →    ∞   such that

[formula]

for all time t  ≥  0, and

[formula]

Integrating the time in the first formula of Proposition [\ref=prop2.3] from -    ∞   to 0, we have

[formula]

If ([\ref=2.6]) does not hold, then there is C > 0 such that for all t > 0, we have

[formula]

which is a contradiction with ([\ref=2.7]).

Since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

This implies

There is a constant C1 > 0 such that for all t > 0

[formula]

[formula]

Moreover when n is even

[formula]

From [\eqref=2.8'] we have Since n is even, and [formula] is monotonically decreasing from the first formula in Proposition 2.1, we know

Proof of the main theorem

To prove Theorem [\ref=thm2], we may assume Nn is orientable. It is well-known that by Gauss-Bonnet-Chern theorem, the Euler Characteristic number χ(Nn) may be expressed as a curvature integral (see Chern [\cite=chern44]):

[formula]

where

[formula]

and [formula] is the curvature form. From equation ([\ref=ge]) and direct calculations, it follows

[formula]

and

[formula]

We remark that equation ([\ref=3.00]) holds for any t > 0, since equation ([\ref=ge]) holds for any time t > 0.

For any fixed p∈Nn, choose an orthonormal frame [formula] such that hij is diagonalied in this frame, i.e. hij  =  λiδij. Then we have

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Let tk be the time sequence chosen in Proposition [\ref=prop2.4], it follows from ([\ref=2.6]) and ([\ref=2.10]) that at t = tk:

[formula]

as k  →    ∞  . This implies

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=3.00]) and ([\ref=3.5]), we have

[formula]

Because n is even, we know [formula] This finishes the main part of Theorem [\ref=thm2].

Clearly, if the minimal volume of Nn is zero, then the Euler characteristic number χ(Nn) is zero. This follows directly from the Gauss-Bonnet-Chern formula ([\ref=3.0']). To see the converse, let χ(Nn) = 0, from ([\ref=3.6]) we have

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=e2.8]), it implies

[formula]

Note that ([\ref=2.4]) and ([\ref=ge]) implies |Rm|(gtk)  ≤  Ct- 1k. So [formula] is a sequence of metrics with sectional curvatures satisfying |KCgtk|  ≤  1 but the volumes converges to zero as k  →    ∞  . This shows the minimal volume of Nn is zero. The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm2] is completed.

To prove Theorem [\ref=thm1], we recall a result of Gromov[\cite=gro82]: the simplicial volume of a compact manifold Xn with negative sectional curvature is positive. In our case, we have the simplicial volume of Mn is positive, so is Nn by the homotopic invariance of simplicial volume. In paper [\cite=gro82], Gromov proved that the minimal volume is always bounded from below by the simplicial volume multiplied by a constant depending only on the dimension. Theorem [\ref=thm1] follows from this result and Theorem [\ref=thm2]. Finally, we mention one corollary:

Let (Mn,g,h) be an even-dimensional compact space-like manifold. Then

[formula]

Equality holds if and only if either (Mn,g,h) is hyperbolic or flat.

It is desirable to generalize Theorem [\ref=thm2] to higher codimensional case. Namely, we may consider the manifold (Mn,g) which is locally embeddable as a space-like higher codimensional submanifold of Rn,m. In this case, a formula similar to the first one in Proposition [\ref=prop2.3] can still hold:

[formula]

where |H|n+ is the absolute value of the squared norm of the (time-like) mean curvature vector. This in particular implies

[formula]
