The Multidimensional Berry-Hannay Model

Introduction

Motivation

In the paper "Quantization of linear maps on the torus - Fresnel diffraction by a periodic grating", published in 1980 (see [\cite=BH]), the physicists M.V. Berry and J. Hannay explore a model for quantum mechanics on the 2-dimensional torus. One of the motivations was to study the phenomenon of quantum chaos in this model (see [\cite=R] for a survey).

Berry and Hannay suggested to quantize simultaneously the functions on the torus and the linear symplectic group [formula].

In this paper we want to extend our construction [\cite=GH] of the 2-dimensional Berry-Hannay model to the higher dimensional tori. The central question is whether there exists a vector space on which a deformation of the algebra of functions and the linear symplectic group [formula], both act in a compatible way. Previously it was shown by Bouzouina and De Bievre (see [\cite=BDB]) that one can quantize simultaneously the functions on the torus and one ergodic element [formula] in case when the Planck constant is of the form [formula].

Definitions

Equivariant quantization of the torus

Fix a 2n-dimensional vector space V over [formula] and a rank 2n lattice Λ  ⊂  V. Let [formula] be the 2n-dimensional torus determined by Λ. We fix a skew-symmetric bilinear form ω on V, which we consider as a differential form on [formula]; we assume that vol[formula].

Denote by [formula] the group [formula] of all the automorphisms of V which takes Λ into itself and preserve the form ω.

Let [formula] be the algebra of smooth complex valued functions on [formula], and let [formula] be the dual lattice of Λ. We use the lattice Λ* in order to have a canonical basis for A. Let < , >  be the pairing between V and V*. The map ξ  ↦  s(ξ) where [formula] defines a canonical isomorphism between Λ* and the group [formula] of characters of [formula]. By Fourier theory the last group form a basis to A.

We will construct a particular type of quantization procedure for the functions (see also [\cite=GH]). Moreover this quantization will be equivariant with respect to the action of the group of "classical symmetries" [formula]:

A   Weyl quantization of A is a family of [formula]-linear morphisms [formula] s.t the following property hold:

[formula]

for all ξ,η∈Λ* and [formula]. Here the form ω denote the form on V* induced by the symplectic form on V.

An equivariant quantization of [formula] is a quantization of A with additional maps [formula] s.t. the following equivariant property (called "Egorov identity") holds:

[formula]

for all [formula] and [formula]. If [formula] is a projective representation of the group [formula] then we call the quantization projective.

Results

In this paper we give an affirmative answer to the existence of the quantization procedure and give explicit formulas. We show a construction (Theorem [\ref=GH], Corollary [\ref=prq]) of the quantization procedure for rational Planck constants. This is the first construction of such equivariant quantization for higher dimensional tori.

The idea of the construction is as follows: We use a "deformation" of the algebra A of functions on [formula]. We define (see [\ref=qs]) two algebras Aε,,  ε  =  0,1. The algebra A0, is the usual Rieffel's quantum torus (see [\cite=Ri]) and A1, is some twisted version of it. If [formula], then we will see that all irreducible representations of Aε, have dimension Nn. We denote by [formula] the set of equivalence classes of irreducible algebraic representations of the quantized algebra. We will see that [formula] is a set "equivalent" to a torus.

The group [formula] naturally acts on a quantized algebra Aε, and hence on the set [formula].

Let [formula] with [formula]. Set ε  =  MN (mod 2). Then:

There exist a unique (up to isomorphism) irreducible representation (π,W) of Aε, for which its equivalence class is fixed by [formula]i.e [formula] for all [formula].

We will give formulas for the canonical representation in section [\ref=F].

Since the canonical representation (π,W) is irreducible, by Schur's lemma we get the canonical projective representation of [formula] compatible with π:

For every [formula] there exist an operator ρ(B) on W s.t:

[formula]

Moreover the correspondence B  ↦  ρ(B) gives a projective representation of [formula].

We will give formulas for the projective representation in section [\ref=F].

The family [formula] presented in Corollary [\ref=prq] gives a canonical equivariant quantization of the torus. We can endow (see ) the space [formula] with a canonical unitary structure s.t [formula] is a *  -representation and [formula] unitary. This answer the question whether this quantization is also unitarizable and hence fits to the idea that quantum mechanics should be realized on a Hilbert space.

Construction

Set [formula] the algebra of smooth complex valued function on the torus. Let [formula]. Let < , >  be the pairing between V and V*. The map ξ  ↦  s(ξ) where [formula] define a canonical isomorphism between Λ* and the group [formula] of characters of [formula].

The quantum tori

Fix [formula] Define two algebras (see also [\cite=Ri] and [\cite=GH])) Aε,,  ε  =  0,1 as follows. The algebra Aε, is defined over [formula] by generators {s(ξ),  ξ∈Λ*}, and relations:

[formula]

for all ξ,η∈Λ*.

Weyl quantization

To get a Weyl quantization of A we use a specific one-parameter family of representations (see subsection [\ref=ceq] below) of the quantum tori. This define an operator π(s(ξ)) for every ξ∈Λ*. We extend the construction to every function f∈A using Fourier theory. Suppose

[formula]

is its Fourier expansion. Then we define its Weyl quantization by

[formula]

The convergence of the last series is due to the rapid decay of the fourier coefficients of f.

Equivariant quantization

We describe a strategy how to get an equivariant quantization of [formula]. The group [formula] acts on Λ preserving ω. Hence [formula] acts on Aε,. The formula of this action is [formula]. Suppose (π,W) is a representation of Aε,. For an element [formula], define [formula]. This formula defines an action of [formula] on the set [formula] of equivalence classes of irreducible algebraic representations of Aε,.

All irreducible representations of Aε, are [formula]-dimensional.

Suppose (π,W) is a representation for which its equivalence class is fixed by the action of [formula]. This means that for any [formula] we have [formula], so by definition there exist an operator ρ(B) on W s.t:

[formula]

This imply the Egorov identity ([\ref=Egorov]) for any function. Suppose in addition that (π,W) is an irreducible representation. Then by Schur's lemma for every [formula] the operator ρ(B) is uniquely defined up to a scalar. This implies that (ρ,W) is a projective representation of [formula].

The canonical equivariant quantization

In what follows we consider only the case [formula]. We write [formula] in the form [formula] with [formula]. Set ε  =  MN (mod 2).

There exist a unique [formula] which is a fixed point for the action of [formula].

Unitary structure

Note that Aε, becomes a    *  -  algebra by the formula s(ξ)*: = s( - ξ). Let (π,W) be the canonical representation of Aε,.

There exist a canonical   (unique up to scalar) unitary structure on W for which π is a *  - representation.

Formulas

We give formulas for the canonical projective equivariant quantization (π,ρ,W). This type of realization is called the Schrodinger model.

Choose a polarization [formula] with [formula]. The form ω defines a non-degenerate pairing between [formula] and [formula] given by <  ξ,ξ' >   =  ω(ξ,ξ'). Set [formula] and W  =  F(X) the space of functions on X. Denote by ψ the additive character of [formula] given by ψ(t)  =  e2πi.

Proofs

Proof of Proposition [\ref=dim]

Suppose (π,W) is an irreducible representation of Aε,.

Step 1. First we show that W is finite dimensional. The algebra Aε, is a finite module over Z(Aε,)  =  {s(Nξ),  ξ∈Λ*} which is contained in the center of Aε,. Because W has at most countable dimension (as a quotient space of Aε,) and [formula] is uncountable then by Kaplansky's trick (See [\cite=MR]) Z(Aε,) acts on W by scalars. Hence dim W  <    ∞  .

Step 2. We show that W is [formula]dimensional.

Choose a basis [formula] of Λ* s.t ω(ei,ej)  =  ω(ei',ej') = 0 and ω(ei,ej')  =  δij the Kronecker's delta. Denote by E the commutative subalgebra of Aε, generated by {s(ei)}n1. Suppose λ∈E* is an eigencharacter of E and denote by [formula] the corresponding eigenspace, λi: = λ(ei). We have the following commutation relation π(ei)π(ej')  =  γδijπ(ej')π(ei) where [formula]. Hence [formula]. Since [formula] the eigencharacters [formula] are all different. Let [formula]. Recall that π(ej')N  =  π(Nej') is a scalar operator. The space [formula] is Nn-dimensional Aε,  -  invariant subspace hence equal   W. [formula]

Proof of Proposition [\ref=ufp]

Suppose (π,W) is an irreducible representation of Aε,. By Schur's lemma for every ξ∈Λ*, π(Nξ) is a scalar operator [formula]. We have [formula], hence χπ(ξ)  ≠  0 for all ξ∈Λ*. Thus to any irreducible representation we have attached a scalar function [formula]. It is easy to see that χπ(ξ  +  η)  =  χπ(ξ)χπ(η). Let [formula] be the group of complex characters of Λ*. We have defined a map [formula] given by π  ↦  χπ. This map is obviously compatible with the action of [formula], where the group [formula] acts on characters by   Bχ(ξ): = χ(B- 1ξ).

The map π  ↦  χπ gives a [formula]-equivariant bijection:

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=realiz] we easily deduce that there exists a unique equivalence class [formula] which is fixed by the action of [formula]. This is the one that corresponds to the trivial character [formula] which is the unique fixed point for the action of [formula] on [formula].

Proof of Lemma [\ref=realiz]. Step 1. The map π  ↦  χπ is onto. We define an action of [formula] on [formula] and on itself by π  ↦  χπ and ψ  ↦  χNψ, where [formula], [formula] and [formula]. The map π  ↦  χπ is clearly a [formula]-equivariant map with respect to these actions. The claim follows since the above action of [formula] on itself is transitive.

Step 2. The map π  ↦  χπ is one to one. Suppose (π,W) is an irreducible representation of Aε,. It is easy to deduce from the proof of Lemma [\ref=dim] that for [formula]. But we know from character theory that an isomorphism class of a finite dimensional irreducible representation of an algebra is recovered from its character. [formula]

Proof of Proposition [\ref=us]

Existence. We use the realization of the representation π given in section [\ref=F]. It is easy to see that the representation (π,F(X)) is a *  - representation with respect to the standard scalar product on F(X) defined by:

[formula]

Uniqueness. From Schur's lemma follows that the Hilbert structure endowed on the vector space of the representation is unique up to a scalar.

[formula]

It can be shown that all the irreducible *  -representations of Aε, on Hilbert spaces are the ones for which χπ takes values in the circle S1.
