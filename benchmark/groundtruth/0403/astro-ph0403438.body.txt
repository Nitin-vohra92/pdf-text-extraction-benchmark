The Vela pulsar, the key?

Introduction

We have observed the pulsar Vela with a range of Australian telescopes. Using the Long Baseline Array (LBA) we have measured the parallax of pulsar, and thus the distance. Using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) we have found the radio pulsar wind nebula (PWN) that surrounds the X-ray PWN. Using the University of Tasmania's dedicated pulsar monitoring telescope in Hobart we have detected the core interaction in the spin up of the pulsar in the glitch of 2000.

Observations

The pulsar monitoring telescope at Hobart is a fourteen meter radio telescope dedicated to timing the Vela pulsar. It collects three frequencies (635, 990, 1340-MHz), and the central one is collected unfolded for high resolution timing analysis ([\cite=dodson_glitch]). The 'fast component' observed, which was fitted with a decay time 1.2 minutes, has been reanalysed with a more realistic model. We marginally detect the core interaction in the spin up ([\cite=lewis_phd]).

The ATCA has been used to map the radio PWN at 21cm, 13cm, 6cm and 3cm. Because we used compact configurations with better sensitivity to low surface brightness objects we are able to map the whole nebula, unlike previous observations ([\cite=biet]).

We have used a single baseline from the LBA to measure the on sky motion of the Vela pulsar compared with the extra galactic source Vela-G. We have measured the proper motion and parallax of the Vela pulsar to an unprecedented accuracy (μα cosδ  =   - 49.68  ±  0.06, μδ  =  29.9  ±  0.1 - 1 , π  =  3.5  ±  0.2 mas), and have been able to convert these back to the space velocity and position angle of the pulsar in its local environment with greater precision that previously possible (61  ±  2 - 1 at [formula]), because of the unambiguity in the radio reference frame. We have found an arithmetic error in [\cite=caraveo_pm] and, once corrected, their results agree with ours (Caraveo, personal comms).

Future observations

We have funding for a coherently dedispersed 30MHz backend for the 635MHz IF on the pulsar timing telescope. This should allow us an increase in sensitivity of an order of magnitude over the previous observations.

We plan to observe at the ATCA the radio nebula at higher frequencies to find the turn over frequency, and model the emission from the X-rays down to the radio frequencies. We are observing at the VLA to get sensitive rapid observations to measure changes associated with the recently discovered X-ray outer jet ([\cite=pavlov_vari]).

The limitation in the accuracy of the VLBI observation is the solar motion parameters, and we can not improve on this. Nevertheless we are planning to use Vela as a demonstration source in a baseband e-VLBI experiment.
