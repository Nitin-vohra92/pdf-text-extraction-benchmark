Abstract

A computational procedure that allows the detection of a new type of high-dimensional chaotic saddle in Hamiltonian systems with three degrees of freedom is presented. The chaotic saddle is associated with a so-called normally hyperbolic invariant manifold (NHIM). The procedure allows to compute appropriate homoclinic orbits to the NHIM from which we can infer the existence a chaotic saddle. NHIMs control the phase space transport across an equilibrium point of saddle-centre-...-centre stability type, which is a fundamental mechanism for chemical reactions, capture and escape, scattering, and, more generally, "transformation" in many different areas of physics. Consequently, the presented methods and results are of broad interest. The procedure is illustrated for the spatial Hill's problem which is a well known model in celestial mechanics and which gained much interest e.g. in the study of the formation of binaries in the Kuiper belt.

Introduction

Chaotic saddles are the saddle-type invariant Cantor sets associated with a horseshoe construction [\cite=nusse]. They play a central role in many complex dynamical phenomena, e.g., the existence of supertransients [\cite=lai1] and the fractal structure of chaotic scattering [\cite=chaos]. The chaotic saddles constructed to date have been related to either homoclinic orbits associated with hyperbolic periodic orbits or special types of equilibria. In this letter we are concerned with a fundamentally new type of high dimensional chaotic saddle structure that can occur only in Hamiltonian systems with three or more degrees of freedom (DOF), and we describe a computational method for detecting it which also illustrates its geometrical complexity.

The chaotic saddle is associated with a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold (NHIM) [\cite=Wiggins3]. The physical significance of NHIMs arises from the fact that their stable and unstable manifolds control the phase space transport across equilibria of saddle-centre-...-centre stability type. This is is not only the fundamental mechanism for the evolution from reactants to products in chemical reaction, but also for "transformations" in general in a large, and diverse, number of applications as e.g. ionisation problems in atomic physics [\cite=JaffeFarellyUzer2000], rearrangements of clusters [\cite=KomaBerry1999], cosmology [\cite=cosmo], and solid state and semi-conductor physics [\cite=Jacucci] [\cite=Eckhardt1995]. Though it had been recognised that it is important to understand the dynamics near saddle-centre-...-centre equilibria it was only recently that new developments in dynamical systems theory offered the theoretical framework and computing power offered the means to study the phase space structure near saddle-centre-...-centres for systems with 3 or more DOF [\cite=Wiggins1] [\cite=Wiggins2] [\cite=wwju] [\cite=ujpyw]. Besides the NHIM and its stable and unstable manifolds it is now possible to compute a codimension 1 submanifold of the energy surface, the so-called transition state, which is transverse to the Hamiltonian flow and locally divides the energy surface into two disjoint components. Locally, the transition state provides the only means of passing from one phase space region (associated with "reactants") to another phase space region (associated with "products"), i.e. trajectories must cross the transition state in order to "react". The transversality of the transition state to the Hamiltonian flow is essential for rate calculations as it solves the problem of locally recrossing trajectories.

In this letter we go beyond this local result and consider more global issues associated with the dynamics related to the transition state and NHIM. In particular, we describe a computational method for determining the existence of homoclinic and heteroclinic connections to NHIMs. Using recent results in [\cite=Cress1], the existence of certain types of these homoclinic orbits allows us to infer the existence of a new type of chaotic saddle (in fact, a Cantor set of chaotic saddles). Because of the ubiquity of saddle-centre-...-centre type equilibria in applications (as described above), we expect that the methods and results presented here, which are applicable to three and more DOF, to be of broad interest.

The physical system we choose to illustrate our method is one from celestial mechanics; the 3-d Hill's equations [\cite=Hill]. Advances in detector technology have opened up new frontiers in celestial mechanics with the discovery of trans-Neptunian objects and binary systems in the Kuiper belt. The calculation of capture probabilities requires the study of the 3-d Hill's equations (rather than the thoroughly studied 2-d case) because many of the capture events occur from high inclination (see e.g. the recent work by Goldreich, Lithwick and Sari [\cite=Gold]).

Hill's Problem and the Phase Space Structure Near Saddle-centre-centre Equilibria

The circular restricted three body problem (CRTBP) models the motion of a tiny particle under the gravitational influence of one (large) primary mass and one (smaller) secondary mass both in circular orbits about their common centre of mass [\cite=murray_dermott]. Hill's problem is a limit version of the CRTBP which describes the motion of the particle in a neighbourhood of the secondary mass. Hill's equations can be derived from the following Hamiltonian in dimensionless units,

[formula]

where r = (x2 + y2 + z2)1 / 2. It is well known that Hill's equations have two equilibria, which are denoted traditionally by L1 and L2, and that the matrices associated with linearising Hamilton's equations about each equilibrium have a pair of real eigenvalues and two pairs of pure imaginary complex conjugate eigenvalues. This means that L1 and L2 are equilibria of saddle-centre-centre type.

A detailed theory for phase space transport near saddle-centre-centre equilibrium points has been developed in recent years [\cite=Wiggins1] [\cite=Wiggins2] [\cite=wwju] [\cite=ujpyw]. For energies slightly above that of the saddle-centre-centre equilibrium point, on the 5-dimensional energy surface there exists an invariant 3-dimensional sphere S3 of saddle stability type. This 3-sphere is significant for two reasons:

It is the "equator" of a 4-dimensional sphere called the transition state. Except for the equator (which is an invariant manifold), the transition state is locally a "surface of no return" in the sense that all trajectories that start in a neighbourhood of the transition state in the energy surface must cross the transition state and exit the neighbourhood (in the appropriate direction in time). For energies "sufficiently close" to the energy of the saddle-centre-centre equilibrium point, the transition state satisfies the bottleneck property. This means that, the energy surface locally has the geometrical structure of S4  ×  I (i.e., 4-sphere ×   interval) and the transition state divides the energy surface into two disjoint components. Moreover, the only way a trajectory can pass from one component of the energy surface to the other is to pass through the transition state.

The 3-sphere is a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold [\cite=Wiggins3] (NHIM), which means that the expansion and contraction rates of the dynamics on the 3-sphere dominate those transverse to it. Just like a "saddle point" it therefore has stable and unstable manifolds. In this case the stable and unstable manifolds are 4-dimensional, having the structure of spherical cylinders, [formula]. Hence, they are of one less dimension than the energy surface and act as "separatrices"; they "enclose" a volume of the energy surface. Their key dynamical significance is that the only way that trajectories can pass through the transition state is if they are inside the region of the energy surface enclosed by the stable and unstable spherical cylinders.

These phase space structures can be realised through a procedure based on Poincaré-Birkhoff normalisation by which explicit formulae for the NHIM, its stable an unstable manifolds, and the transition state are given [\cite=ujpyw] in "normal form coordinates". The phase space structures are then mapped back into the original coordinates by the inverse of the normal form (NF) transformation.

Computation and Visualisation of the Phase Space Structures near L1 and L2

We will visualise the phase space structures near Hill's equilibria L1 and L2 as their projections to configuration space. In understanding the result, and its implications, it is useful to recall that the level sets of the effective potential energy

[formula]

the so-called zero velocity surfaces, confine the motion in configuration space.

In figure [\ref=fig:zvs](a) we show the zero velocity surface (ZVS) V = E for an energy E =  - 4.4 which is 0.1 above the energy of the equilibrium points. The ZVS encloses the energetically-allowed volume of configuration space. For Hill's equations its shape has two "bottlenecks" associated with L1 and L2 which divide the allowed volume into three regions: a bounded region about the origin (for which - 1 < x <  + 1 (A)) and two unbounded regions (for which x <  - 1 (B) and x >  + 1 (C), respectively). The phase space structures near L1 and L2 regulate the transport through the bottlenecks between these regions.

The NFs about L1 and L2 are related by symmetry. It is thus sufficient to compute explicitly only the NF about L1. As a result of the two complex eigenvalues associated with the equilibria being rationally independent, the NF, to any desired finite order of computation, is completely integrable with integrals given by I  =  p1q1, [formula]. The NF Hamiltonian can be written solely as a function of the integrals, H  =  H(I,J2,J3), and Hamilton's equations decouple into the product of independent linear systems

[formula]

The transition state 4-sphere is given by q1 = p1. From the equations of motion it is easy to see that it is a "surface of no return". Its equator p1 = q1 = 0 is the NHIM (3-sphere). It has 4-dimensional stable (q1 = 0) and unstable (p1 = 0) manifolds. In the energy surface volume enclosed by the stable and unstable manifolds I is positive; outside I is negative. The NHIM has a special structure. It is foliated by a one parameter family of invariant 2-tori (the "Hopf fibration") [\cite=Wiggins1] [\cite=Wiggins2] [\cite=ujpyw]. These tori can be parametrised e.g. by the integral J2 where J3 is then given implicitly by energy conservation and I = 0. At the minimal and maximal values of J2 the 2-tori degenerate to periodic orbits, the so-called "Lyapunov orbits". The 2-tori and the periodic orbits have 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional stable and unstable manifolds, respectively, which are contained in the 4-dimensional stable and unstable manifolds of the NHIM. These geometrical considerations will play an important role described below.

We perform the NF computation to order 18 using the computer algebra system Mathematica. As a result the NF Hamiltonian is a sum over 219 multivariate monomials in (I,J2,J3). Each component of the mapping between NF coordinates and the original phase space coordinates involves sums over about 50  000 multivariate monomials. The resulting transition state and NHIM are shown in figure [\ref=fig:zvs](b). Notice that the transition state completely blocks the "bottleneck" in the ZVS in configuration space; it also blocks the bottleneck in the level set of the Hamiltonian in phase space.

Computation of Homoclinic and Heteroclinic Connections between the NHIMs near L1 and L2

The "saddle integral", I  =  p1q1, plays the key role in our numerical approach to detecting orbits connecting the same NHIM, or orbits connecting different NHIMs. Taking into account the Hopf fibration of the NHIM our procedure consists of the following four steps:

In the NF coordinates, choose an invariant 2-torus on the NHIM and seed a mesh covering the torus with initial conditions. Displace these initial conditions slightly in the direction of the unstable manifold of this torus (p1 = 0,  q1  =  ε).

Map the initial conditions back into the original coordinates using the NF transformation.

Integrate the initial conditions forward in time using Hill's equations. Since they are in the unstable manifold they will leave the neighbourhood in which the NF transformation is valid (which is why we integrated them in the original coordinates).

Check if a trajectory returns to the neighbourhood of L1 or L2 where the NF is valid. If so, map it into the NF coordinates and check the value of its saddle integral. If the saddle integral is zero, the trajectory must be on the stable manifold of the respective NHIM (since the trajectory is already on the unstable manifold and two unstable manifolds cannot intersect).

The procedure can be understood as a shooting method between the I-fibres of the locally valid NFs. We apply the method to Hill's problem by displacing (with ε = 10- 4) meshes of initial conditions on invariant 2-tori of the NHIM near L1 along the respective unstable manifold branches which are directed towards the bounded region about the origin, see figure [\ref=fig:zvs]. These initial conditions are propagated by integrating Hill's equations where the singularity at the origin is taken care of by the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel regularisation. If the resulting trajectory reenters or enters the neighbourhood of validity of the NF about L1 or L2, respectively, we check the value of the integral I. A positive I means that the trajectory will cross the respective transition state which leads to an exit to the outside of the bounded region about the origin. In this case the integration is stopped. A negative value of I means that the trajectory does not exit on this approach of L1 or L2 and the integration is continued until the trajectory reaches a validity neighbourhood of the NF with positive I. It is to be noted that along the part of a trajectory which traverses the validity neighbourhood of the NF the values of the integrals (I,J2,J3) are conserved to 12 digits and more, demonstrating the high accuracy of the NF.

We illustrate the results in figure [\ref=fig:hopf] where contours of the integral [formula] (light blue/dark blue; exit through the transition state near L1) and [formula] (yellow/red; exit through the transition state near L2) are shown plotted on the corresponding torus of the NHIM. At the boundary of a light blue/dark blue region [formula] goes to zero and points on the boundary correspond to homoclinic orbits which connect the NHIM near L1 to itself. Similarly, boundaries of yellow/red regions represent heteroclinic connections between the NHIMs near L1 and L2.

Though the individual regions in figure [\ref=fig:hopf] themselves are regular in the sense that they each have a smooth boundary, the disposition of the regions is very intricate. We illustrate this for initial conditions on the 2-dimensional unstable manifold of the Lyapunov periodic orbit near L1 which has J3 = 0 and in configuration space lies in the (x,y)-plane, see figure [\ref=fig:lyapunov]. Between each two arcs which extend from two consecutive zeros of I as a function of the angle conjugate to J2 there is an infinity of further arcs. Each zero represents an orbit which in time is backward asymptotic to the Lyapunov periodic orbit and forward asymptotic to the NHIM near L1 (blue) or the NHIM near L2 (red). The result is a self-similar structure well known from classical scattering systems.

Homoclinic Connections and Chaotic Saddles

While orbits homoclinic to normally hyperbolic invariant tori have been studied ([\cite=Wiggins4]), tori cannot be normally hyperbolic in Hamiltonian systems [\cite=bolotin]. The NHIM is normally hyperbolic, yet there are no theorems describing the dynamics associated with orbits homoclinic to a normally hyperbolic invariant sphere (part of the difficulty here comes from the fact that a sphere cannot be described by a single coordinate chart, but see [\cite=cosmo] for numerical evidence that this could be an important mechanism for chaos). An important piece of this problem has recently been solved by Cresson [\cite=Cress1] who proved that if the stable and unstable manifolds of a torus in the NHIM intersect transversely, then there exists a (uniformly) hyperbolic invariant Cantor set on which the dynamics is conjugate to a shift map, i.e., a chaotic saddle. The stable and unstable manifolds of a 2-torus are 3-dimensional in the 5-dimensional energy surface. A transverse intersection is necessarily 1-dimensional, i.e., a trajectory.

When the effect of the neglected terms in the normal form expansion (i.e., the non-normalised "tail" of the expansion) are included we expect, by KAM theory, that a Cantor set of non-resonant tori in the Hopf fibration will persist. Homoclinic intersections of the stable and unstable manifolds of a given 2-torus (rather than more general connections between the manifolds of such a torus and those of the entire NHIM) can be detected easily by our numerical procedure described above. We therefore not only check the value the integral I upon entering the neighbourhood of validity of the same NF that we started from, but also the difference between the centre integral J2 of the 2-torus we started from and the centre integral J'2 in the entered validity neighbourhood. If both J2 - J'2 and I vanish we have a homoclinic orbit to the 2-torus under consideration. The result of such a procedure is shown in figure [\ref=fig:homorbit](a) where homoclinic connections appear as the intersection points of the zero contours of J2 - J'2 (sharp boundaries between dark blue and light blue within the blue regions) and those of I (boundaries of the blue regions themselves). Figure [\ref=fig:homorbit](b) shows the example of a homoclinic orbit which corresponds to one of the prominent intersection points marked by a white dot in the figure. In fact there are many more intersection points located in the finer structures of figure [\ref=fig:homorbit](a). There is a tendency that the homoclinic orbits become more complicated in the finer regions.

Conclusions

In this letter we have described a numerical method for detecting a Cantor set of chaotic saddles in Hamiltonian systems with three DOF. We have illustrated it for the spatial Hill's problem. The implications for this problem should be of current interest in celestial mechanics. Recently it has been shown that chaos plays an important role in the energetics of capture [\cite=nature], and this Cantor set of chaotic saddles should be central to this process. Chaotic scattering in systems with three or more DOF is poorly understood, and our results and methods should provide a window into this subject. Towards this end, our methods detect the chaotic saddles by detecting appropriate homoclinic orbits.

Concerning transition state theory, as described by Truhlar [\cite=truhlar], there are two types of trajectories that exhibit multiple recrossings of the transition state: local and global. As described in the introduction, the correct choice of transition state solves the local recrossing problem. However, characterising the global recrossing problem, i.e. the question of whether there are trajectories, which, after crossing the transition state and leaving its neighbourhood, return to the transition state and cross it again, is more difficult. Under additional assumptions on the geometry of the homoclinic or heteroclinic orbits, the chaotic saddles consist of trajectories that enter and leave a neigborhood of the transition state, recrossing it infinitely often. This will be the subject of a future publication.

It would also be of some interest to actually compute and visualise the chaotic saddles themselves. A recently developed numerical method [\cite=sweet] may play a role for this purpose. Finally, we remark that our results are not limited to 3 DOF. The general theory developed in [\cite=Wiggins1] [\cite=Wiggins2] [\cite=wwju] [\cite=ujpyw] applies to Hamiltonian systems with arbitrary DOF. The numerical method generalises easily since the saddle integral is a scalar function regardless of the number of DOF.
