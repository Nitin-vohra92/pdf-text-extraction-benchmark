Power Corrections in Charmless B Decays

Introduction

With the excellent performance of KEK and SLAC B factories, a great number of charmless B decay channels have been measured with high precision. It is even more exciting that, with the expected larger data sample in the near future, CP violations in many decay channels might be soon reachable. However in most cases, our ignorance of strong dynamics stands in the way of either identifying the signal of new physics or extracting the fundamental Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) angles from the observables.

Theorists have tried hard to have a better understanding on the strong dynamics in non-leptonic B decays, in which QCD factorization method (QCDF)[\cite=QCDF] is a recent progress. In the heavy quark limit, QCDF has shown that the hadronic matrix elements of B decays have simpler non-perturbative structures, while the QCD corrections are perturbatively calculable, at least at one-loop order. However the 1 / mb power corrections, especially annihilation contributions and chirally enhanced power corrections [\cite=QCDF1] [\cite=DYZ], are phenomenologically important. It is even worse that factorization generally breaks down beyond the leading power expansion. As a result, the model-dependent parametrization has to be introduced in QCDF to account for these formally power-suppressed contributions. For some decay channels, these power corrections could even compete with the leading power contributions in some parameter space which makes the reliability of QCDF predictions in doubt. Very recently, a new effective theory, called soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), has been applied to charmless B decays [\cite=SCET], in which the power corrections can be studied in a systematic way, though more non-perturbative operators have to be introduced. However since this method is still under development and several issues remain to be resolved, we shall not discuss SCET further in this paper.

Thus it is of great interest to investigate the role of power corrections in charmless B decays, and to determine if the power corrections were really important, whether they were mainly from chirally enhanced corrections and annihilation topology or from other sources of power corrections, such as long-distance rescatterings. In this paper, we shall discuss these problems in a transparent way based on experimental measurements.

QCD factorization for charmless B decays

To make the paper self-contained, we will recapitulate the main point of QCDF in the following. One may find more details in Refs [\cite=QCDF] [\cite=QCDF1] [\cite=DYZ] [\cite=QCDF2] [\cite=DYZPV].

There are three distinct scales: MW  ≫  mb  ≫  ΛQCD involved in charmless B decays. To go beyond naive model estimation, the physics of different scales should be separated from each other. It is known that, with the operator product expansion and renormalization group equation, the effective Lagrangian can be obtained, in which short-distance effects involving large virtual momenta of the loop corrections from the scale MW down to μ  =  O(mb) are cleanly integrated into the Wilson coefficients. Then the amplitude for the decay B  →  M1M2 can be expressed as [\cite=Buras]:

[formula]

where λq is a CKM factor, Ci(μ) is the Wilson coefficient which is perturbatively calculable from first principles. The effective operators Q1,2 and Q3,...,6 are tree level and QCD penguin operators, respectively. We have neglected electroweak penguin operators Q7,...,10 because their effects are numerically small in most decay channels. 〈M1M2|Qi(μ)|B〉 is a hadronic matrix element which contains the physics effects from the scale μ  =  O(mb) down to ΛQCD. Since the perturbative and nonperturbative effects related to mb and ΛQCD still entangle with each other, it is highly nontrivial to estimate the hadronic matrix elements. But in the heavy quark limit, QCDF shows that the above hadronic matrix elements can be factorized into hard radiative corrections and simpler nonperturbative structures which can be parametrized by the form factors and meson light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs).

But for phenomenological applications, the power corrections in 1 / mb, especially the chirally enhanced corrections and annihilation contributions should be taken into account. Chirally enhanced corrections arise from two-body twist-3 LCDAs of the final state mesons. Unfortunately the factorization breaks down for hard spectator scattering diagrams because the twist-3 LCDA does not approach zero in the endpoint region which introduces a logarithmic divergence. A similar divergence also appears in the annihilation contributions. Phenomenologically, Beneke et al. [\cite=QCDF1] adopted a model parametrization for the endpoint divergence:

[formula]

where XA (XH) denotes the divergent terms from annihilation topology (hard spectator scattering). The corresponding price to pay is model-dependence uncertainties and also large numerical uncertainties from XA,H. With the above discussions, the decay amplitudes can be written as

[formula]

where 〈M1M2|Oi|B〉f is the factorized hadronic matrix element which has the same definition as that in the naive factorization approach. For the complete expressions of QCD coefficients ai and annihilation parameters bj, one may refer to Ref. [\cite=QCDF2].

Are power corrections large ?

It is clear that chirally enhanced power corrections should be large, at least in B decays to two light pseudoscalar mesons, because although they are suppressed by the factor (taking the pion as an illustration)

[formula]

which is formally of the order of ΛQCD / mb, numerically this factor is of order one. Experimentally, the large branching ratios of B  →  πK decays also strongly support this statement. For example, the ratio

[formula]

would be theoretically smaller than 1 without chirally enhanced contributions, say rKχa6 term. The experimental data in the above equation are from ref. [\cite=HFAG1].

However it is not very clear about the role of annihilation topology in B decays. It was once believed to be quite small in most B decay channels, because of the power suppression [\cite=Ali]. The importance of annihilation contributions was first noticed in the perturbative QCD method for charmless B decays[\cite=pQCD]. Recent phenomenological analyses [\cite=DYZGA] [\cite=QCDF2] [\cite=aleksan] [\cite=cottingham] based on QCDF also suggest substantial contributions from annihilation topology. However since in QCDF, there are many parameters involved in the global analysis of experimental data, it would be interesting to show the importance of annihilation topology in a transparent way. In the following we will try to do it with various ratios. We find that annihilation topology very likely plays a significant role, at least in penguin dominated B  →  PV decays, where P denotes light pseudoscalar meson and V denotes light vector meson.

Let us first consider the ratio of the decay amplitude of [formula] to that of B0  →  ρ+π-. If the power corrections were negligible, this ratio would be theoretically very clean where the form factors cancel out, furthermore it is almost independent ot the CKM angle γ and the strange-quark mass:

[formula]

where the penguin contributions to B0  →  ρ+π- decay and the term proportional to VubVus in the numerator are neglected. This should be a reasonable approximation up to a few percent level. In QCDF, [formula] should be about or less than 0.04 (With the default parameters in ref. [\cite=QCDF2], it is 0.03) and [formula] is very close to unity. While for the CKM matrix elements, there is a useful inequality [\cite=Pham] [\cite=Buras1]:

[formula]

The current measured value of sin 2β from BaBar and Belle gives [\cite=HFAG]

[formula]

from which we obtain sin β  =  0.402  ±  0.033. In principle we could get another solution sin β≃0.9 which however is inconsistent with the direct |Vub| measurements. So given λ = 0.224, we will get an interesting lower limit

[formula]

With this lower limit, there arises a clear discrepancy between theory and experiments:

[formula]

where the left hand side is from theoretical estimation Eqs. ([\ref=pik]), ([\ref=inequality]), ([\ref=inequality2]) and the right hand side is obtained from the following experimental measurements: B(B0  →  ρ+π-) = 13.9  ±  2.7 [\cite=laget], [formula] [\cite=HFAG1] and τ(B+) / τ(B0) = 1.083  ±  0.017 [\cite=PDG]. Notice that cos 2α is of the order of a few percent, it seems appropriate to neglect it in Eq. ([\ref=inequality]). Then the left hand side of Eq. ([\ref=pikrhopi]) would be reduced further to 0.46  ±  0.04 if we fix (a4 + rχa6) / a1 to be 0.04. In fact, (a4 + rχa6) / a1 for [formula] channels is typically less than 0.04 in most of the QCDF parameter space. For example, if using the default parameters in ref. [\cite=QCDF2], we will get 0.35 for this ratio. Since the chirally enhanced corrections for this ratio are not expected to be large because [formula] vanishes at tree level, this is a strong indication that annihilation topology and/or other sources of power corrections might play an important role at least in B  →  PV decays.

If we turn to another ratio, the branching fraction of B0  →  K+ρ- to that of B0  →  ρ-π+, there is similar disagreement, although this time it is not well established considering the large theoretical uncertainties. Assuming negligible annihilation contributions, the form factors cancel out again for this ratio. However there are significant dependences on angle γ, Vub / Vcb and especially the strange-quark mass ms in the numerator because of the factor rKχ:

[formula]

where as usual, the small penguin terms in the denominator has been neglected. If we take the default parameters in ref. [\cite=QCDF2], namely [formula], Vub / Vcb = 0.09 and ac4(ρK) - rKχac6(ρK) = 0.037 + 0.003i with the strange-quark mass set to be 90 MeV, the theoretical prediction for the ratio B(B0  →  K+ρ-) / B(B0  →  ρ-π+) is 0.38, which is again significantly smaller than the experimental measurements 1.01  ±  0.34 [\cite=HFAG1] [\cite=laget]. Of course, when the theoretical uncertainties, especially the uncertainty of the strange-quark mass, are taken into account, the disagreement is not that impressive. For example, the ratio can rise up to 0.69 when ms is lowered to 70 MeV.

However when combining with the [formula] decay, this result shows that there is a tendency that, the penguin-dominant B  →  PV decay amplitudes are consistently underestimated without annihilation contributions. When they are included, [formula] is dominated by [formula] while B0  →  K+ρ- is dominated by fKABρ0m2B(a4 - rKχa6) + b3(P,V) with

[formula]

Since the penguin terms a4≃ - 0.03 and a4 - rKχa6≃0.037 are of opposite sign, the key observation is that, the annihilation terms b3(V,P) and b3(P,V) are also roughly of the opposite sign, because numerically (C5 + NcC6)Af3 is the dominant term in b3 while Af3(P,V) =  - Af3(V,P) if the annihilation parameter XA are the same for both channels. So with the inclusion of annihilation topology, QCDF can easily enhance both ratios without fine tuning. For example, using the default parameters given in ref. [\cite=QCDF2] but letting the annihilation parameter ρA = 1 we can see from Fig. 1 that the ratios are then consistent with experimental observations. We believe that this is a strong indication that annihilation topology probably plays an important role, at least in penguin-dominated B  →  PV decays.

Similar disagreement can be found in the ratio of B0  →  ωK0 over B0  →  π+ρ-. But we will not go into details here because B0  →  ωK0 decay is quite similar to B0  →  K+ρ- decay. It may also be interesting to discuss B  →  φK decays, but again they are quite similar to [formula] decays if there is no new physics contributions in this decay.

Direct CP violations

If one agrees that annihilation terms are very likely important in charmless B decays, one negative point is that, these intractable terms will bring large uncertainties to the theoretical predictions, not only in the branching fractions, but also in direct CP asymmetry . In the following we will try to see whether we can get some interesting relations with a few selective ratios of direct CP asymmetry (DCPVs).

Let us first consider the ratio of DCPVs ACP(π+π-) over ACP(π-K+). Belle has claimed large DCPV observed in B0  →  π+π- decay while BaBar has not confirmed it yet, but both of them are close to a measurement on ACP(π-K+) [\cite=Belle] [\cite=BaBar]

[formula]

Since QCDF generally predicts small DCPVs for charmless B decays, at first glance it seems to contradict the Belle data badly. But notice that annihilation topology and other sources of power corrections could bring large uncertainties, it is of interest to have further investigations. In QCDF, we could define the tree and penguin amplitudes as:

[formula]

Then the DCPVs can be expressed as

[formula]

where δ  =  δP  -  δT is the strong phases difference between the penguin and tree amplitudes. It is easy to see that many factors cancel out for the ratio

[formula]

where the ratio TP / T̃P̃ has been taken to be 1, which is a reasonable approximation in QCDF at about 10 percent level uncertainty. The experimental data on relevant branching ratios [\cite=HFAG1] have been used in the above equation, and only the experimental uncertainties are included in the error estimation.

At first sign, it is amazing to realize that one would expect very naturally a larger DCPV for π+π- decay compared with π-K+ decay, if the strong phases of both channels are not too small and of similar magnitude. Notice that the DCPV measurements already told us that at least the strong phase of π+π- channel should not be small and QCDF predicts quite similar strong phases for both channels if other sources of power corrections are negligible. Actually, it is quite plausible that CP-violating asymmetry in π+π- decay should be bigger than that for π-K+ by a factor of 3 - 4 since the π+π- decay rate is smaller than the π-K+ decay rate by a similar factor 3 - 4, given the fact that in QCDF the CP-violating parts of the tree-penguin interference terms are almost equal as shown above. The current experimental value [\cite=Belle] [\cite=BaBar] for this ratio is

[formula]

which is still consistent, within 1σ error, with the theoretical estimation of - 2.7  ±  0.3 under the assumption that the strong phases δ and [formula] are the same. It should be interesting to keep an eye on this ratio and any significant deviation from theoretical estimation would suggest either different strong phases between ππ and πK decays or New physics effects affecting one of the channels. It is also interesting to note that inelastic B  →  DD  →  ππ and B  →  DDs  →  Kπ rescatterings or charming penguin contributions could also produce a large strong phase, but since these contributions are related by SU(3) symmetry and CKM factor, the interference terms would be essentially equal and our relation for the CP asymmetry applies and we expect large CP asymmetry in B  →  ππ as found recently [\cite=Isola] [\cite=Ciuchini].

With the same reasoning, we can get similar relations for other decay channels such as:

[formula]

If the above pairs of strong phases are roughly the same, which is true in QCDF, The DCPVs of the penguin-dominated decays would be about 1.5 times larger than those of their tree-dominated counter parts. Precise measurements on these ratios could help us to get some insight into the strong dynamics of B decays.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have used the ratios of the branching fraction of [formula] to that of B0  →  π-ρ+, and of B0  →  K+ρ- to that of B0  →  π-ρ+, to show clearly and with greatly reduced theoretical uncertainties, that power corrections in charmless B decays are probably large. The key observation is that QCDF predicts the annihilation terms for [formula] and B0  →  K+ρ- are almost the same magnitude but opposite in sign. The result is that both these two branching fractions could be enhanced by the annihilation contribution to accommodate the experimental data without fine tuning. Assuming the presence of the annihilation contribution, we then derive relations between CP asymmetries for a few selective decay channels and shows that QCDF would predict the direct CP asymmetry of B  →  π+π- to be about 3 times larger than that of B  →  π±K∓ with opposite sign, which is consistent, within one sigma error, to the current experimental data - 4.2  ±  1.8. Any significant deviation from this prediction would suggest either new physics or possibly the importance of long-distance rescattering effects. We also discuss other similar direct CP ratios which might help us to get some insight into the strong dynamics of charmless B decays.

Note Added

After finishing this paper, we were informed that Eq. ([\ref=DCPV]), the relation between the direct CP asymmetries and CP-averaged branching ratios of B0  →  π+π- and B0  →  π-K+, has been derived previously by R. Fleischer [\cite=fleischer].
