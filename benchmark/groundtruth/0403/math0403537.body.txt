Backward volume contraction for endomorphisms with eventual volume expansion

Statement of results

Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold and let [formula] be a volume form on M that we call Lebesgue measure. We take f:M  →  M any smooth map. Let [formula] be a sequence converging to infinity. We define

[formula]

if this minimum exists, and h(x) =   ∞  , otherwise. For n  ≥  1, we take

[formula]

Assume that [formula], for some p > 3, and take γ < (p - 3) / (p - 1). Choose any sequence [formula] such that bkbn  ≥  bk + n for every [formula], and assume that there is [formula] such that [formula] for every n  ≥  n0. Then, for [formula] almost every x∈M, there exists Cx > 0 such that | det Dfn(y)| > Cxbn for every y∈f- n(x).

We say that f:M  →  M is eventually volume expanding if there exists λ > 0 such that for Lebesgue almost every x∈M

[formula]

Let h and Γn be defined as in ([\ref=aga]) and ([\ref=gamma]), associated to the sequence an = eλn.

If f is eventually volume expanding, then for Lebesgue almost every point x∈M there are Cx > 0 and σn  →    ∞   such that | det Dfn(y)| > Cxσn for every y∈f- n(x). Moreover, given α > 0 there is β > 0 such that

if [formula], then we may take σn  ≥  eβn;

if [formula] for some τ > 0, then we may take σn  ≥  eβnτ;

if [formula] and α > 2, then we may take σn  ≥  nβ.

Specific rates will be obtained in Section [\ref=se.examples] for some eventually volume expanding endomorphisms. In particular, non-uniformly expanding maps such as quadratic maps and Viana maps will be considered.

Concatenated collections

Let (Un)n be a collection of measurable subsets of M whose union covers a full Lebesgue measure subset of M. We say that (Un)n is a concatenated collection if:

[formula]

Given [formula], we define u(x) as the minimum [formula] for which x∈Un. Note that by definition we have x∈Uu(x). We define the chain generated by [formula] as [formula]

Let (Un)n be a concatenated collection. If

[formula]

then we have [formula] for Lebesgue almost every x∈M.

Assume that for a given x∈M there exists an infinite number of chains [formula], j  ≥  1, containing x with sj  →    ∞  . For each [formula] let 1  ≤  rj < sj be such that x = frj(yj). First we verify that lim rj  =    ∞  . If not, then replacing by a subsequence, we may assume that there is N > 0 such that rj < N for every [formula]. This implies that [formula] for every [formula]. Since [formula] and the number of chains is infinite, we have a contradiction. Since rj  →    ∞   and x = frj(yj)∈frj(u- 1(sj)), then we have [formula] for every k  ≥  1. Since we are assuming [formula], we have [formula] when k  →    ∞  . This completes the proof of Lemma [\ref=JClemma1].

Let (Un)n be a concatenated collection. If

[formula]

then [formula] for all [formula].

Assume that [formula], and take z∈f- n(x). Let zj = fj(z) for each j  ≥  0. We distinguish the cases x∈C(z) and x∉C(z). If x∈C(z), then n  ≤  u(z)  ≤  n + N. Hence [formula] If x∉C(z), then letting u0 = u(z) we must have u0 < n. Let u1 = u(zu0). If u0 + u1  <  n we take u2 = u(zu0 + u1). We proceed in this way until we find the first s  ≤  n such that [formula]. Note that [formula], and by the choice of s we must have [formula]. Our assumption implies that [formula], and so [formula]. By construction we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

By the definition of a concatenated collection we conclude that [formula].

Proofs of main results

Let us now prove Theorem [\ref=Mtheo]. Suppose that [formula], for some p > 3. This implies that [formula], and so there exists some constant K > 0 such that

[formula]

Now, taking 0 < γ < (p - 3) / (p - 1) we have for some K' > 0

[formula]

Defining

[formula]

then we have that (Un)n is a concatenated collection with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Moreover, setting

[formula]

one has [formula], for otherwise there would be [formula] with m < n, and so am  ≥  bm > | det Dfm(x)|  ≥  am, which is not possible. As | det Dfj(x)| < bj for every x∈U*n and j < n, we get [formula] for each j < n. Hence

[formula]

Now we just have to check that the last term in the sum above is finite. Indeed,

[formula]

Applying Lemmas [\ref=JClemma1] and [\ref=JClemma2], we get for each generic point x∈M a positive integer number Nx such that if y∈f- n(x) then y∈Un + s for some 0  ≤  s  ≤  Nx. Therefore, | det Dfn + s(y)| > bn + s  ≥  bn. Then, taking Cx = K- Nx, where K =  sup {| det Df(z)|:z∈M}, we obtain the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=JCtheo]:

[formula]

Now we explain how we use Theorem [\ref=JCtheo] to prove Corollary [\ref=Mtheo]. Recall that in Corollary [\ref=Mtheo] we have an = eλn for each [formula]. Assume first that [formula] for some [formula]. Then it is possible to choose c > 0 such that bn = ecn, for n  ≥  n0. The other two cases are obtained under similar considerations.

Examples: non-uniformly expanding maps

An important class of dynamical systems where we can immediately apply our results are the non-uniformly expanding dynamical maps introduced in [\cite=ABV]. As particular examples of this kind of systems we present below quadratic maps and the higher dimensional Viana maps.

Quadratic maps.

Let fa:[ -  1,1]  →  [ -  1,1] be given by fa(x) = 1 - ax2, for 0 < a  ≤  2. Results in [\cite=BC1] [\cite=J] give that for a positive Lebesgue measure set of parameters fa in non-uniformly expanding. Ongoing work [\cite=F] gives that for a positive Lebesgue measure set of parameters there are C,c > 0 such that [formula] for every [formula].

Thus, it follows from Corollary [\ref=Mtheo] that we may find β > 0 such for Lebesgue almost every x∈I there is Cx > 0 such that |(fn)'(y)| > Cxeβn for every y∈f- n(x).

Viana maps.

Let a0∈(1,2) be such that the critical point x = 0 is pre-periodic for the quadratic map Q(x) = a0 - x2. Let [formula] and [formula] given by b(s) =  sin (2πs). For fixed small α > 0, consider the map [formula] from [formula] into itself given by [formula], where (s,x) = a(s) - x2 with a(s) = a0  +  αb(s), and ĝ is the uniformly expanding map of S1 defined by ĝ(s) = ds (mod [formula]) for some integer [formula]. For α > 0 small enough there is an interval I  ⊂  ( - 2,2) for which (S1  ×  I) is contained in the interior of S1  ×  I. Thus, any map f sufficiently close to [formula] in the C0 topology has S1  ×  I as a forward invariant region. Moreover, there are C,c > 0 such that [formula] for every [formula]; see [\cite=AA] [\cite=BST] [\cite=V].

Thus, it follows from Corollary [\ref=Mtheo] that we may find β > 0 such for Lebesgue almost every X∈S1  ×  I there is a constant CX > 0 such that [formula] for every Y∈f- n(X).
