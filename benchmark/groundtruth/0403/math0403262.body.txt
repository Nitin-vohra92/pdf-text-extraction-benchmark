Abstract. Lin and Chang gave a generating function of convex polyominoes with an m + 1 by n + 1 minimal bounding rectangle. Gessel showed that their result implies that the number of such polyominoes is

[formula]

We show that this result can be derived from some binomial coefficients identities related to the generating function of Jacobi polynomials.

Some (binomial coefficients) identities arise from alternative solutions of combinatorial problems and incidentally give added significance to doing problems the "hard" way.

Abbreviated title: The Number of Convex Polyominoes

Introduction

A polyomino is a connected union of squares in the plane whose vertices are lattice points. A polyomino is called convex if its intersection with any horizontal or vertical line is either empty or a line segment. Any convex polyomino has a minimal bounding rectangle whose perimeter is the same as that of the polyomino. Delest and Viennot [\cite=DV] found a generating function for counting convex polyominoes by perimeter and showed that the number of convex polyominoes with perimeter 2n + 8, for n  ≥  0, is

[formula]

Later, Lin and Chang [\cite=LC] gave a generating function for the number of convex polyominoes with an (m + 1)  ×  (n + 1) minimal bounding rectangle, and Gessel [\cite=Gessel] showed that their result implies that the number of such polyominoes is

[formula]

which is easily seen to give a refinement of Delest and Viennot's formula.

Since Gessel [\cite=Gessel] (see also Bousquet-Mélou [\cite=BM]) derived [\eqref=eq:Ge] from the generating function of Lin and Chang [\cite=LC] (see also Bousquet-Mélou and Guttman [\cite=BMG]), it would be interesting to find an independent proof of [\eqref=eq:Ge]. For Delest and Viennot's formula [\eqref=eq:DV] such a proof was already given by Kim [\cite=Kim]. The aim of this paper is to provide such a proof for [\eqref=eq:Ge] by generalizing Kim's elementary approach. It turns out that the resulting binomial coefficients identities are related to the generating function of Jacobi polynomials.

In the next section, we translate the enumeration of convex polyominoes with fixed minimal bounding rectangle as that of two pairs of non intersecting lattice paths, which results to evaluate a quadruple sum of binomial coefficients. In Section 3, we establish some binomial coefficients identities which lead to the evaluation of the desired sums.

Non intersecting lattice paths and determinant formula

A lattice path is a sequence of points [formula] in the plan [formula] such that either si - si - 1 = (1,0),  (0,1) for all [formula] or si - si - 1 = (1,0),  (0, - 1) for all [formula]. Let Pm,n be the set of convex polyominoes with an m + 1 by n + 1 minimal bounding rectangle. As illustrated in Figure [\ref=fig:convex], any polyomino in Pm,n can be characterized by 4 lattice paths L1, L2, L3 and L4 which are given by

[formula]

Note that a polyomino in Pm,n is convex if and only if the two lattice paths L1,L2 (resp. L3,L4) don't intersect. The following lemma can be readily proved by switching the tails of two lattice paths, which is also a special case of a more general result [\cite=GV].

Let a,b,c and d be non negative integers such that a' > a, b > b' , c > a, d > b, c' > a' and d' > b'. Then the number of pairs of non intersecting lattice paths (P1,P2) such that P1:(a,b)  →  (c,d) and P2:(a',b')  →  (c',d') is given by

[formula]

It follows that the cardinality of Pm,n is given by

[formula]

Note that in [\eqref=eq:initial] we have adopted the convention that [formula], which corresponds to a1 = b1 = 0 or a2 = b2 = 0. In this case the path L1 or L2 is a point.

We next split the sum in [\eqref=eq:initial] into three terms: the a1 = a2 = b1 = b2 = 0 term,

[formula]

the a1 = b1 = 0 or a2 = b2 = 0 terms,

[formula]

and the sum in [\eqref=eq:initial] for ai and bi  ≥  1. This third term can be split into four more terms obtained from the product: (a11a22 - a12a21)(b11b22 - b12b21) = S2 - S3 - S4 + S5. The last sum S5 is 0 because the sum of the numerator parameters of binomials coefficients are less than that of the denominator parameters.

We now proceed to evaluate or simplify S1, S2, S3 and S4 using the Chu-Vandermonde formula:

[formula]

where [formula] for n  ≥  1 and (x)0 = 1.

Applying the Chu-Vandermonde formula to the b-sums for S1 yields

[formula]

As

[formula]

by telescoping it follows that

[formula]

Consider now the second sum S2:

[formula]

By the Chu-Vandermonde formula we have

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Setting a = a1 - a2 we can rewrite the above sum as

[formula]

By the Chu-Vandermonde formula we have

[formula]

Since

[formula]

telescoping yields

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Look at the term S3:

[formula]

Summing the a2-sum and b2-sum by the Chu-Vandermonde formula yields

[formula]

Hence, replacing a1 and b1 by a and b respectively we get

[formula]

by the substitutions a←m - a + 1 and b←n - b + 1.

Finally we have

[formula]

Summing the a1-sum and b2-sum by the Chu-Vandermonde formula yields

[formula]

Substituting a2 and b1 by a and b we obtain

[formula]

for the summand is zero if a = m - 1,m or b = n - 1,n.

We shall evaluate S3 and S4 in the next section.

Jacobi polynomials and evaluation of S3 and S4

Set

[formula]

The following identity is equivalent to the generating function of Jacobi polynomials:

[formula]

The reader is referred to [\cite=AAR] and [\cite=Ra] for two classical analytical proofs and to [\cite=FL] for a combinatorial proof.

Applying the operator [formula] to the α  =  β = 1 case of [\eqref=eq:pqdelta] yields:

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Proof. Consider the generating function of S4:

[formula]

Applying [\eqref=eq:pqdelta] to the inner double sum yields

[formula]

The theorem follows then from [\eqref=eq:delta].

There holds

[formula]

Proof. Consider the generating function of S4:

[formula]

Applying [\eqref=eq:pqdelta] to the inner double sum yields

[formula]

Set

[formula]

By bisecting twice, we get the terms of even powers of x and y in f(x,y):

[formula]

i.e.,

[formula]

Now, the α  =  β = 0 and α  =  β = 2 cases of [\eqref=eq:pqdelta] read:

[formula]

As

[formula]

extracting the coefficients of xmyn in the above equation completes the proof.

Summarizing, formula [\eqref=eq:Ge] follows then from [\eqref=eq:S0]-[\eqref=eq:S2], [\eqref=eq:S3] and [\eqref=eq:S4].
