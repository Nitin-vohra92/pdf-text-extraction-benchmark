The Rank of the Endomorphism Monoid of a Partition

Introduction

If S is a semigroup and U is a subset of S then we say that U generates S if every element of S is expressible as a word in the elements of U. We use the convention that the empty word represents the identity element. The rank of a semigroup S, denoted by S, is the minimum among the cardinalities of its generating sets. It is well-known that a finite full transformation semigroup has rank 3, while a finite full partial transformation semigroup has rank 4 (see [\cite=howie]). Similar results were proved for many different classes of transformation semigroups (such as total, partial, partial one-to-one, order preserving) and their ideals; see [\cite=1] [\cite=8] [\cite=10] [\cite=15] [\cite=16].

Some generalizations of the notion of rank, for instance the idempotent rank and the nilpotent rank, also attracted a great deal of attention (see [\cite=2] [\cite=6] [\cite=14], among others).

Finally, in recent years, the notion of relative rank has been subjected to extensive research (see for example [\cite=0] [\cite=mitchell1] [\cite=8.5] [\cite=9] [\cite=mitchell2] [\cite=11]). Relative rank is a useful notion when dealing with finite semigroups (see Lemma [\ref=l1]), and it is crucial when dealing with uncountable semigroups. In fact, in such semigroups, the notion of rank is not very informative as the rank and the cardinality coincide. To a large extent, this line of research was prompted by two old papers by Sierpiski [\cite=si] and by Banach [\cite=sb-1935] (see also [\cite=ams]).

In this paper we deal with the endomorphism monoid of a non-trivial uniform partition. We prove that the rank of such semigroup is 4, thus settling a problem posed in [\cite=huisheng]. We also calculate the ranks of some related transformation semigroups.

If X is a finite set then the set of transformations on X form the full transformation monoid on X and is denoted by [formula]. We assume that transformations act on the right; that is, if x∈X and [formula], then xf denotes the image of x under f. Let P be a partition of X; that is, [formula] where [formula], [formula] whenever i  ≠  j, and [formula]. The equivalence relation that corresponds to a partition P is denoted ~  ¶. The elements of [formula] that preserve the partition P form a semigroup and is denoted by [formula]. Using symbols,

[formula]

The partition P is called uniform if |Pi| = |Pj| for all [formula]. The main result of Huisheng's paper [\cite=huisheng] is that for a uniform partition P the rank of [formula] is at most 6, or smaller in some degenerate cases. Huisheng's proof relied on the observation that there is a strong relationship between [formula] and the rank of the group G of invertible transformations in [formula]. He proved that the rank of G is at most 4 (or smaller in some degenerate cases). In the present paper, we are able to show, for [formula], that G = 2 (see Theorem [\ref=wrth]). In order to facilitate the proof of our results, we use the concept of wreath products of transformation semigroups; see Section [\ref=wreath].

We can also consider the rank of some further interesting semigroups related to a partition P of a set X. Let us define

[formula]

It is routine to check that [formula].

The following theorem improves Huisheng's result and settles the problem of determining the rank of [formula]. It also gives the rank of Σ(X,P) and Γ(X,P). A partition of X is said to be trivial if it has 1 or |X| parts (that is, the trivial partitions are the identity and the universal partitions).

If X is a finite set such that [formula], and P is a non-trivial uniform partition of X, then [formula] and Σ(X,P) = Γ(X,P) = 3.

Wreath products of transformation semigroups

We define the wreath product of two transformation semigroups following [\cite=straubing] (see also [\cite=mel]). The material of this section is well-known, however, we felt that it was necessary to present it in order to make the paper self-contained and also to set our system of notation. Let S and R be two transformation semigroups acting on the sets Y and Z, respectively, and let B denote the set of functions f:Z  →  S. The underlying set of the wreath product [formula] is the Cartesian product B  ×  R and to each element (f,r)∈B  ×  R, we assign a transformation of the set Y  ×  Z defined by

[formula]

It is easy to see that this assignment is injective and that the image of this assignment is closed under composition; that is, the image is a subsemigroup of [formula].

From now on we assume that the sets Y and Z are finite and that S and R are monoids, that is, they contain the identity transformation id. Let us assume without loss of generality that [formula] and [formula]. In this case, a function f:Z  →  S can be represented as the m-tuple [formula] where f(i) = si for all [formula]. This defines a bijection between B  ×  R and Sm  ×  R, and, in turn, between [formula] and Sm  ×  R. Therefore we may view an element of [formula] as a pair [formula] where [formula] and r∈R. The element [formula] will more briefly be denoted by [formula]. Setting [formula] the same element can be written as sr. By [\eqref=wract], the action of [formula] on a pair (y,z)∈Y  ×  Z is given by

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] be transformation monoids as above. Then S and R can naturally be embedded into the wreath product [formula]. Indeed, we may consider the following submonoids of [formula]:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Set, for [formula], [formula]. Easy computation shows that the elements of [formula] leave the set [formula] invariant, and [formula], considered as a transformation monoid on [formula], is isomorphic to the transformation monoid S. Let us further define [formula]. Then [formula] leaves [formula] invariant, and [formula], considered as a transformation monoid on [formula], is isomorphic to R. Since [formula] and [formula], we may consider Sm and R as submonoids of [formula].

Since R is assumed to be a transformation monoid on the set [formula], we may define a homomorphism ϑ:R  →  Sm:

[formula]

We note that the action of (Sm) on Sm is a left-action. The homomorphism ϑ is useful for expressing the operation in [formula]. Indeed, let s1, s2∈Sm and r1, r2∈R. Then, viewing s1r1 and s2r2 as elements of [formula], easy computation shows that

[formula]

Therefore the wreath product [formula] can also be viewed as the semidirect product [formula] of Sm and R with respect to the homomorphism ϑ:R  →  (Sm) (see [\cite=mel]). In particular, if r is an invertible element of R and s∈Sm, then, considering s and r as elements of [formula], equation [\eqref=wrop] implies that

[formula]

Therefore conjugation by an invertible element of R leaves Sm invariant, and the conjugation action of R is given by the homomorphism ϑ. Indeed, from the last displayed line we obtain that sr = r- 1sr = (r- 1ϑ)s. Note that the conjugation action of the element r is actually given by the endomorphism r- 1ϑ. The reason for this is that we assumed that endomorphisms act on the left, while the usual definition makes the conjugation action a right-action. Further, if r is an invertible element of R and [formula] such that ir = j then [\eqref=conj] implies that [formula].

For a finite set X, the invertible elements of [formula] form the symmetric group [formula]. If P is a partition of X then set [formula]. The next lemma connects the semigroups related to a partition to wreath products.

Let [formula] and [formula], set X = Y  ×  Z, and let P denote the partition [formula]. Then

[formula];

[formula];

[formula];

[formula].

Since the proofs of these statements are very similar to each other, we only verify assertion (ii). Let (y1,z1), (y2,z2)∈Y  ×  Z and assume that [formula] [formula] so that [formula]. Set [formula]. We have, for i = 1, 2, that

[formula]

Thus, if (y1,z1)  ~  ¶(y2,z2), then z1 = z2, and then z1s = z2s; hence, in this case, (y1,z1)w  ~  ¶(y2,z2)w. Conversely, if (y1,z1)w  ~  ¶(y2,z2)w, then z1s = z2s, which, using that s is a invertible, gives that z1 = z2; therefore (y1,z1)  ~  ¶(y2,z2). This shows that w∈Σ(X,P), and so [formula].

Suppose now that x∈Σ(X,P). Then the defining property of Σ(X,P) implies that x induces a permutation on the set P. Since there is a one-to-one correspondence between P and [formula], we obtain that x induces a permutation on Z. Let this permutation be s. For [formula], let us define a transformation [formula]. Let [formula] such that ix = j. Then, for all [formula] there is some [formula] such that (k,i)x = (lk,j). Let ti be the transformation that maps k to lk for all [formula]. Then routine computation shows that [formula], and so [formula]. Thus, [formula], and so [formula]

Relative rank of semigroups

Let U  ⊆  S be a subset of a semigroup S. The relative rank of S modulo U, denoted by [formula], is the minimum among the cardinalities of subsets V of S such that [formula]. The relative rank was introduced in [\cite=8.5]. The next lemma shows that the rank of a transformation semigroup is related to its relative rank modulo the unit group.

Let S be a finite transformation semigroup and let G be the group of units in S. If U  ⊆  S such that [formula], then [formula]. In particular, S =   +  G.

It suffices to show that [formula], and so suppose that g∈G. Since U is a generating set of S, we obtain that [formula] with some [formula]. Since g is invertible, we obtain that [formula] must also be invertible, and so [formula]. Thus [formula], and hence the assertion follows.

Next we determine the relative ranks of [formula], Σ(X,P) and Γ(X,P) modulo their unit groups.

If X is a finite set and P is a uniform partition of X, then

[formula]

and

[formula]

We may suppose without loss of generality that X = Y  ×  Z where [formula], [formula] and P is the partition

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=wreq], [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula], and so it suffices to show that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let [formula] denote the transformation in [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] for all [formula]. Then [formula] (see [\cite=howie]). Set [formula] and [formula]. We claim that

[formula]

For [formula], let us define the following submonoids of [formula]:

[formula]

Let us first prove [\eqref=eq1]. As [formula], we find that [formula]. Since [formula], we obtain that [formula], and hence [formula]. For all [formula], there is some [formula] such that 1r = i, and, as discussed before Lemma [\ref=wreq], we obtain that [formula]. Therefore [formula]. As [formula] and [formula], we obtain that [formula], and so the required equality holds.

Now we show that [\eqref=eq2]. As [formula], we have that [formula]. As [formula], we obtain that [formula]. As [formula], we obtain that [formula], and so the claim is proved.

As [formula], the arguments in the previous two paragraphs show that [formula]. As [formula], we obtain [\eqref=eq3].

As [formula] is a proper submonoid of each of the monoids [formula], [formula] and [formula], equation [\eqref=cl2] must be valid. In order to show [\eqref=cl1], it suffices to prove that  > 1. Suppose that [formula] such that [formula]. Then there are [formula], such that [formula]. Thus [formula] and hence [formula], where Δ  =  {(x,x)|x∈X}. Since [formula], we obtain that [formula]. Similarly, there exist [formula] such that [formula], Thus [formula] and hence

[formula]

Hence, for some [formula], we have ((1,1)g,(2,1)g) = ((i,1)h,(i,2)h), that is, ((1,1),(2,1))gh- 1 = ((i,1),(i,2)). This, however, is a contradiction, because (1,1)  ~  ¶(2,1), but [formula] and the transformation gh- 1 preserves the equivalence relation ~  ¶.

Therefore we verified that [formula] is a proper submonoid of the wreath product [formula], which shows that equation [\eqref=cl1] must hold.

The Rank of [formula]

In this section we prove the following theorem.

If X is a finite set such that [formula] and P is a uniform partition of X then [formula] is generated by two elements.

In our terminology, the previous theorem gives that [formula]. We note that the rank of a transitive permutation group, such as [formula], is defined in permutation group theory as the number of orbits of a point-stabilizer. Thus, in order to avoid possible confusion, we decided to state the theorem above without using the notation [formula].

Theorem [\ref=main] will follow from Lemmas [\ref=l1] and [\ref=l2] and Theorem [\ref=wrth].

Using the fact that [formula] is isomorphic to a wreath product [formula], it is not difficult to see that [formula] is generated by four elements. Indeed, consider the subgroups [formula] and [formula] defined in [\eqref=si] and [\eqref=r]. Since [formula] and [formula] is transitive by conjugation on the subgroups [formula], we obtain that [formula]. Since [formula] and [formula] are full symmetric groups, they are generated by two elements, and so we obtain that [formula] is generated by at most four elements. Essentially this is proved in [\cite=huisheng].

Before proving Theorem [\ref=wrth], we state two simple lemmas.

Let G be a permutation group acting on the set [formula] and let [formula] be a field. Let V denote the n-dimensional vector space over [formula] with basis [formula]. The group G can be thought of as a permutation group on the set [formula], and this defines an [formula]-module structure on V as follows:

[formula]

The module V is called the permutation module for G over [formula].

The following lemma is well-known; see, for instance, [\cite=kl].

If [formula], then the permutation module for [formula] over a field [formula] of characteristic p has precisely two proper non-trivial submodules:

[formula]

Further, if p|n then [formula]; otherwise [formula].

Suppose that [formula] where the Gi are finite groups. For [formula] the function [formula] is the natural projection map. We also write ϱi for ϱ{Gi}. A subgroup X of G is said to be a strip if for each [formula] either Xϱi = 1 or [formula]. The set of Gi such that Xϱi  ≠  1 is called the support of X and is denoted [formula]. Two strips X1 and X2 are disjoint if [formula]. A strip X is said to be full if Xϱi = Gi for all [formula], and X is called non-trivial if [formula]. A subgroup K of G is said to be subdirect if Kϱi = Gi for all i.

We recall a well-known lemma on finite simple groups which can be found in [\cite=scott]. The proof of the lemma is elementary and does not use the finite simple group classification.

Let M be a direct product of finitely many non-abelian, finite simple groups and let H be a subdirect subgroup of M. Then H is the direct product of pairwise disjoint full strips of M.

The wreath product of two transformation semigroups S and R was defined in Section [\ref=wreath], and the definition can also be used to construct the wreath product of two permutation groups G and H. Recall that the wreath product [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] and a typical element of [formula] is denoted by [formula] where πi∈G and σ∈H. Setting [formula], the same element can also be written as πσ. The following lemma facilitates the calculations in [formula].

Let [formula] where G and H are as above. Then

π1σ1π2σ2  =  π1(π2)σ- 11σ1σ2;

(πσ)- 1 = (π- 1)σσ- 1;

[formula].

In particular the projection map [formula] defined by πσ  ↦  σ is a homomorphism.

The assertion that ϱ is a homomorphism follows from (i). The rest can be verified using [\eqref=wrop] and [\eqref=conj].

Now we are ready to prove Theorem [\ref=wrth]. Permutations of a finite set will be written as products of disjoint cycles.

By Lemma [\ref=wreq](iv), it suffices to show, for [formula] and [formula], that the group [formula] is generated by two elements whenever [formula]. Since, for a finite set Y, the group [formula] is generated by two elements, we may assume that [formula] and [formula]. Let [formula] denote the group of even permutations of Y. Then [formula] is a normal subgroup of index two of [formula]. As [formula], we may consider the subgroups [formula] and [formula] of W and let A and S denote these subgroups respectively.

Let us define

[formula]

Set [formula] and we claim that M = W.

Let [formula] denote the natural projection map in Lemma [\ref=lem]. If either n or m is odd then [formula]; otherwise [formula]. As

[formula]

we obtain that [formula]. As S =  ker ϱ, in order to prove that M = W, it suffices to show that [formula].

Next we claim that [formula]. If n = 2, then A = 1, and so we may assume that [formula]. First we suppose that n = 3. In this case [formula] and so A can be viewed as a W-module over [formula], and, in particular, it can be viewed as a [formula]-module over the same field. In fact, A is the natural permutation module for [formula]. Since [formula], the intersection [formula] is an [formula]-submodule of A. Now [formula] and so [formula], but, if [formula], then y2 is not an element of either of the two proper submodules listed in Lemma [\ref=replem]. Therefore [formula], and so [formula] follows when n = 3 and [formula]. The case (n,m) = (3,2) can be checked using a computer algebra package such as GAP [\cite=gap] or Magma [\cite=Magma].

Let us assume that n = 4, that is, [formula], and, as above, we may also assume without loss of generality that [formula]. Note that [formula] admits the decomposition [formula] where [formula] and [formula]. Further, U can be considered as an irreducible V-module over [formula].

Let m be odd and set z1 = (xmy2)2. As

[formula]

we obtain that [formula]. As [formula], the subgroup M has an element of the form π(2,3) where π∈S. Then set z = zπ(2,3)1 and compute that [formula] where σ1 and σ3 are three-cycles in [formula]. Now set

[formula]

and consider the element w = wz1w1. Now, as the first component of z∈S is a non-trivial three cycle, the element w is of the form [formula] where σ∈{(1,2)(3,4),(1,3)(4,2),(1,4)(2,3)}.

Assume now that m is even and set z = (xm - 1y2)4. Easy computation yields that

[formula]

and that

[formula]

As V is irreducible on U, the computation above shows that the [formula]-submodule generated by w coincides with [formula] of m is odd, and [formula] if m is even. Thus [formula] in the former case, and [formula] in the latter. As [formula], we also obtain that [formula].

Now the quotient [formula] can be considered as a permutation module for [formula] over [formula], and as [formula] and [formula], we obtain that [formula] is a [formula]-submodule. However, the image of the element z above is not in either of the proper submodules listed in Lemma [\ref=replem], and so we obtain that [formula] which shows that [formula].

Hence we have shown that [formula] if [formula]. Assume now that [formula]. In this case [formula] is a non-abelian finite simple group and so A is a non-abelian characteristically simple group.

Set [formula]. Clearly, [formula] and [formula]. Let us show that Q is a subdirect subgroup of [formula]. If n or m is odd then set [formula]; otherwise set [formula]. Further,

[formula]

Therefore z, y2∈Q. Let ϱ2 denote the second coordinate projection [formula]. Since zϱ2 = (1,2)∈Qϱ2 and [formula], we obtain that [formula]. Simple computation shows that if τ∈Q and πσ∈M then τπσϱ2σ  =  τπϱ2. Therefore

[formula]

As [formula], it follows that [formula] for all i, and so Q is a subdirect subgroup of [formula]. Consider the commutator subgroup Q'. Since S' = A, we obtain that [formula]. Further, as [formula], we also obtain, for all i, that [formula]. Therefore Q' is a subdirect subgroup of [formula]. Set [formula]. Since [formula] and Q' is a subdirect subgroup, we obtain that so is R; that is, by Lemma [\ref=scott1], R is a direct product of disjoint strips.

Let S be a strip in R and let [formula] be the support of S. We claim that S is a block for the action of [formula]. Indeed, if [formula] then there is some π∈S such that πσ∈M. Then Sπσ is strip in R and so either S = Sπσ or [formula]. The support of Sπσ is Sσ. Thus either Sσ  =  S or [formula], which shows that S is a block, as required. Since [formula] is primitive on [formula] either |S| = 1 or [formula]. If the latter holds, then Q is a strip. This, however, is impossible. Indeed, if m = 2 and n is odd, then set [formula]; if m = 2 and n is even then set [formula]; if [formula], then set [formula]. Then in all cases z2∈R, but z2 is not in a full strip (if m = 2 and n is even then note that the first component of z2 is of order n / 2 and the second is of order n - 1). Thus |S| = 1, and so [formula].

This completes the proof of the claim that that [formula] for all n and m.

Note that A is a normal subgroup of W and let x  ↦  x̂ denote the natural homomorphism W  →  W / A. If [formula], then Ĥ denotes the image HA / A of H. Then [formula] and [formula]. We claim that [formula]. Note that [formula]. If πσ∈ and [formula] then uπσ = uσ. As [formula] we obtain that [formula] which shows that [formula] is a [formula]-submodule of [formula]. It is clear that Ŝ is the natural permutation module for [formula] over [formula]. Lemma [\ref=replem] lists the non-trivial proper submodules U1 and U2 of Ŝ.

If both n and m are even then [formula] and this element is not in either U1 or U2. Hence [formula]. If this is not the case, then [formula] which shows that [formula]. If n is even and m is odd then [formula] and so [formula]. Therefore in this case [formula] follows.

Suppose that n is odd. If m = 2 then [formula]. Thus [formula] is not in either of the proper submodules listed in Lemma [\ref=replem]. Hence [formula] follows in this case. If [formula], then

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] so that xy = πσ. As σm - 1 = 1, it follows from Lemma [\ref=lem] that

[formula]

Thus (xy)m - 1 is of the form [formula] where, for [formula], the permutation πi is either [formula] or [formula], that is, πi is a cycle with length n - 1. As n is odd, [formula], and so [formula]. Now if m is even then ()m - 1 is not an element of U1 or U2, and so [formula] follows also in this case. If m is odd then this shows that [formula], and as we proved above that [formula], it follows that [formula].

Thus we have shown that [formula] as required. As explained above, M = W now follows.

The main result of the paper can now be proved.

As usual, we assume without loss of generality that X = Y  ×  Z where [formula], [formula] and P is the partition

[formula]

By Lemmas [\ref=wreq], [\ref=l1], [\ref=l2] and Theorem [\ref=wrth],

[formula]

The assertions concerning Γ(X,P) and Σ(X,P) can be proved very similarly.
