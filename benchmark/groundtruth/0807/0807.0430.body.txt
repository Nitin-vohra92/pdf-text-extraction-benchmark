Analogue of Sylvester-Cayley formula for invariants of n-ary form

1. Let be Fd,n the [formula]-space of n-ary forms of degree d:

[formula]

where [formula] [formula] [formula] and

[formula]

Let us identify the algebra of polynomial function [formula] with the polynomial [formula]-algebra Ad,n of the variables set {ai,i∈In,d}. The natural action of the group SLn on Fd,n induces the actions of SLn ( and [formula]) on the algebra Ad,n. The corresponding ring of invariants [formula] is called the ring of invariants for the n-ary form of degree d.

The ring [formula] is graded ring

[formula]

here [formula] is the vector subspace generated by homogeneous invariants of degree k.

Denote νn,d(k): =  dim (ASLnd,n)k. For the binary form the number ν2,d(k) is calculated by well-known Sylvester-Cayley formula, see [\cite=Hilb]. For the tenary form the number ν3,d(k) is calculated in the paper of the present author, see [\cite=ASM]. In this paper we generalize those formulas for the case of n-ary form.

2. In the Lie algebra [formula] denote by Ei  j the matrix unities. The matrices H1: = E2,  2  -  E1,  1, H2: = E3,  3  -  E2,  2, [formula] Hn - 1: = En - 1,  n - 1  -  En - 2,  n - 2 generate the Cartan subalgebra in [formula]

Recall that the ordered set of integer numbers [formula] is called the weight of [formula]-module V, if there exists v∈V such that v is common eigenvector of the operators Hs and Hs(v) = λs  v, [formula] A weight is said to be dominant weight if all λs  ≥  0. Note, our definition of weight is slightly different than the standard weight definition as function on the Cartan subalgebra. Denote by ΛV the set of all weight of [formula]-module V and denote by Λ+V the set of dominant weight of V. Also, denote by Γλ the unique irreducible [formula]-module with highest weight λ.

Let A be the vector subspace of An,d generated by all elements {ai,i∈Id,n} of degree 1. The operators Hi, [formula] act on the basis elements ai, i∈In,d of the space A in the following way, see [\cite=AA] :

[formula]

Therefore, the basis elements ai,i∈In,d of [formula]-module A are the common eigenvectors of the operators Hs with the weights

[formula]

It is clear that A is irreducible [formula]-module with the highest vector [formula] and with the highest weight [formula] Thus, [formula] The number νn,d(k) is the multiplicities of trivial [formula]-module [formula] in the decomposition the symmetrical power Sk(A) on irreducible [formula]-modules, i.e. [formula]. Here [formula] is determined from the decomposition:

[formula]

Since the multiplicities of all weights are equal to 1 we may write down the the character of A:

[formula]

Here e(εi) are generating elements of the group ring of the weight lattice [formula]

We need the following technical lemma

Direct calculations.

The character of [formula]-module Sk(A) is the complete symmetrical polynomial Hk of the variable set e(εi), i∈In,d, see [\cite=FH]. Therefore, we have

[formula]

Direct calculations,using Lemma 1.

For arbitrary μ∈ΛΓλ denote by μ* the unique dominant weight on the orbit W(μ) of the Weyl group W. Such dominant weight exists and unique, see. [\cite=Hum].

On the [formula]-module Γλ let us define the value Eλ in the following way

[formula]

Here ρ is half the sum of the positive roots of Lie algebra [formula] nλ(μ) is the multiplicities of the weight μ in Γλ and |s| is the sign of the element s∈W. Note, nλ(μ) = 0 if μ∉Γλ.

The following lemma plays crucial role in the calculation.

For [formula] there is nothing to prove - the multiplicities of trivial weight in the trivial representation is equal to 1.

Suppose now [formula] We use the following recurrence formula, see [\cite=NS], for the multiplicities nλ(μ) of the weight μ in the [formula]-module Γλ:

[formula]

Substituting [formula] and taking into account that the multiplicities of the weights ρ - s(ρ) and (ρ - s(ρ))* coincides we obtain the formula.

Now we are ready to calculate the value νn,d(k)

The number νn,d(k)) is equal to the multiplicities [formula] of trivial representation [formula] in the symmetrical power Sk(A). The decomposition

[formula]

implies the folowing characters decompositions

[formula]

Taking into account

[formula]

we get

[formula]

By using Lemma 2 we get

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

By equating the coefficients of e(μ), we obtain

[formula]

Then, by using previous lemma we have

[formula]

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

This concludes the proof.

3. It is easy to see that the multiplicities γn,d(k,λ) is equal to number of linearly independed highest vectors of [formula]-module Sk(A) with highest weight λ. Any highest vector is the invariant of the subalgebra of upper triangular unipotent matrices of the Lie algebra [formula]. Such elements is called semi-invariants of n-ary form. In the same way we can prove the theorem Let us introduce the conception of covariants for n-ary form. Denote by Cn,d the algebra of polynomial functions of the following [formula]-module

[formula]

The subalgebra [formula] of [formula]-invariants is called the algebra of covarians of n-ary form. For n = 2 the classical Roberts' theorem [\cite=Rob] states that the algebras of semi-invariants and covariants are isomorphic. The similar result for ternary form proved by the author in the paper [\cite=AA].

The following statement seems to hold

Conjecture. The algebras of semi-invariants and covariants of n-ary form are isomorphic.

If it is true, then Theorem 2 defines the formula for calculation of the number linearly independed covariants for n-ary form of the weight λ and degree k.

4. Example. Let n = 3. Then half the sum of the positive roots ρ is equal to (1,1). The Weyl group of Lie algebra [formula] is generated by the three reflections sα1, sα2, sα3, here α1 = (2, - 1), α2  =  (  -  1,2) i α3  =  (1,1) are all positive roots. The orbit W(ρ) consists of 6 weights - (1,1) and

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

Thus, taking into account the signs of the correponsing elements of the group W we get the following indentity for any dominant weight λ of the standard irreducible [formula]-module Γλ:

[formula]

Since the weights (1,1),(2, - 1),( - 1,2) lies on the same orbit it is implies (2, - 1)* = ( - 1,2)* = (1,1) and

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Therefore, using Theorem 1, we obtain

[formula]

It coincides completelly with result of the paper [\cite=ASM].

5. Let us derive the formula for calculation of νn,d(k). Solving the system of equations

[formula]

for [formula] we get

[formula]

It is not hard to prove that the number [formula] of nonnegative integer solutions of the following system

[formula]

is equal to coefficient of [formula] of the expansion of the series

[formula]

Denote it in such way:

[formula]

Then, for a set of integer numbers [formula] the number [formula] of integer nonnegative solutions of the system of equations

[formula]

is equals

[formula]

By using the multi-index notation rewrite the last expression in the form

[formula]

To each μ∈In,d assing the following vector

[formula]

Then the following formula holds

[formula]
