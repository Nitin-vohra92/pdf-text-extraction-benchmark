SO(3) Gauge Symmetry and Nearly Tri-bimaximal Neutrino Mixing

The observed massive neutrinos and dark matter in our universe challenge the standard models of both particle physics and cosmology. So both flavor physics and cosmology may tell us fundamental physics[\cite=JN]. In this note I will concentrate on discussing the neutrino physics.

Various neutrino experiments[\cite=EXP1] [\cite=EXP2] [\cite=EXP3] [\cite=EXP4] [\cite=EXP5] [\cite=EXP6] [\cite=EXP7] [\cite=EXP8] [\cite=PDG] provide more and more stringent constraints on the three mixing angles and mass squared differences for three neutrinos[\cite=SV] [\cite=TNM2] [\cite=TNM1]

[formula]

at the 99% confidence level[\cite=SV]. In comparison with the quark sector, it raises a puzzle that why neutrino masses are so tiny, but their mixing angles are so large[\cite=HF] [\cite=PM]. The only peculiar property for neutrinos is that they could be Majorana fermions, so a natural solution to the puzzle is most likely attributed to the Majorana features. Thus revealing the origin of large mixing angles and small masses of neutrinos is important not only for understanding neutrino physics, but also for exploring new physics beyond the standard model[\cite=MS].

The current data on the neutrino mixing angles are consistent with the so-called tri-bimaximal mixing with [formula], [formula] and θ13 = 0, which was first proposed by Harrison, Perkins and Scott [\cite=HPS], and investigated by various groups[\cite=HPS1] [\cite=HPS2] [\cite=HPS3] [\cite=HPS4]. The mixing angle [formula] is the most unclear parameter and expected to be measured in near future. Such a tri-bimaximal mixing matrix has been found to be yielded by considering some interesting symmetries, especially the discrete symmetries[\cite=Ma]. In general, it is shown that the discrete symmetries lead to θ13 = 0 [\cite=Lam]. In such a case, it is hard to be directly tested experimentally. Alternatively, it is interesting to consider a non-abelian gauge family symmetry SO(3)[\cite=YLW0] [\cite=YLW1] [\cite=YLW2] [\cite=YLW3] [\cite=YLW4] [\cite=YLW5] [\cite=YLW6] [\cite=CS] [\cite=MA] [\cite=CW] [\cite=BHKR] instead of discrete symmetries discussed widely in literature. In this case, the tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing matrix is generally obtained as the lowest order approximation from diagonalizing a special symmetric mass matrix[\cite=YLW0]. In fact, the greatest success of the standard model (SM) is the gauge symmetry structure SU(3)c  ×  SUL(2)  ×  UY(1) which has been tested by more and more precise experiments. SO(3) gauge family symmetry can be regarded as a simple extension of the standard model with three families and Majorana neutrinos. It is noted that only SO(3) rather than SU(3) is allowed due to the Majorana feature of neutrinos.

The SO(3)  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y invariant Lagrangian for Yukawa interactions of leptons with Majorana neutrinos can be constructed as follows[\cite=YLW0]

[formula]

where yν, ye, yN, ξe, ξN and ξE are all real Yukawa coupling constants and MR is the mass of right-handed Majorana neutrinos. All the fermions νLi, νRi, eLi, eRi, Ei and Ni (i = 1,2,3) belong to SO(3) triplets in family space. Where i  =  (Li,ēLi) denote SUL(2) doublet leptons, H and HN are SUL(2) doublet Higgs bosons with H̃  =  τ2H*. νRi are the right-handed neutrinos with νcRi  =  cTRi the charge conjugated ones. Ei are SUL(2) singlet vector-like charged leptons and the Ni are SUL(2) singlet vector-like Majorana neutrinos with Nci  =  Ni. φs is a singlet Higgs boson. The scalar fields Φν and Φe are SO(3) tri-triplets Higgs bosons satisfying [formula], Φν  =  ΦTν and [formula] which is required by the hermiticity condition of Lagrangian and the Majorana condition of vector-like neutrinos. The above Lagrangian is solely ensured by the following discrete symmetry (Z2 and Z4)

[formula]

In terms of SO(3) representation, one can reexpress the real symmetric tri-triplet Higgs boson into the following general form

[formula]

with λi (i = 1,2,3) being the generators of SO(3). Where Θνi(x) (i = 1,2,3) may be regarded as three rotational scalar fields of SO(3), and φνi(x) (i = 1,2,3) are three dilatation scalar fields.

SO(3) gauge invariance allows us to fix the gauge by making SO(3) gauge transformation g(x), so that [formula], we then arrive at the following Yukawa interactions

[formula]

which is invariant under Z3 transformation. Where e  =  OTνΦeOν remains Hermitian and contains nine independent scalar fields, which can generally be reexpressed in terms of SO(3) representation as the following form

[formula]

and

[formula]

where χei(x) (i = 1,2,3) are regarded as three rotational scalar fields of SO(3), ηei(x) (i = 1,2,3) denote three phase scalar fields and φei(x) (i = 1,2,3) are three dilation scalar fields.

We now consider the following general vacuum structure of scalar fields under the above gauge fixing condition

[formula]

namely [formula], eiδe2,eiδe3) and < Oe  >    =  eiλiθei. Here δei (i=1,2,3) are CP phases arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking and θei are three rotational angles of SO(3).

Such a vacuum structure after spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to the following mass matrices for neutrinos with a type II like see-saw mechanism and for charged leptons with a generalized see-saw mechanism

[formula]

with mDν  =  yνv, mDN  =  yNvN, [formula], Ve  =   < Ue  >    =  Peδeiλiθei, and

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula], and θeij are given as functions of θei (i = 1,2,3). A similar special symmetric neutrino mass matrix like MN was also resulted for the Dirac-type neutrinos with a new symmetry[\cite=FLee] and the Majorana-type neutrinos with the Z3 group[\cite=HWW].

When taking the Majorana neutrino masses MR and MN to be infinity large, the interactions with Majorana neutrinos decouple from the theory,

[formula]

which implies that the resulting Yukawa interactions in this limit generate additional global U(1) family symmetries for the charged lepton sector. Namely, once the Majorana neutrinos become very heavy, the Yukawa interactions possess approximate global U(1) family symmetries. Thus when applying the mechanism of approximate global U(1) family symmetries[\cite=HW] [\cite=WW] [\cite=WU] to the Yukawa interactions after SO(3) symmetry is broken down spontaneously, we have MR  ≫  mDν, MN  ≫  mDN and θei  ≪  1, namely

[formula]

which provides a possible explanation why the observed left-handed neutrinos are so light and meanwhile the charged lepton mixing angles must be small. Thus the neutrino mass matrix is given by a type II like see-saw mechanism and the charged lepton mass matrix is presented by a generalized see-saw mechanism. By diagonalizing the mass matrices, we obtain

[formula]

where

[formula]

with

[formula]

Here V0 is the so-called tri-bimaximal mixing matrix[\cite=HPS]. For short, we have introduced the notations [formula] and [formula] with

[formula]

As the smallness of charged lepton mixing angles θeij (i < j) can be attributed to the mechanism of approximate global U(1) family symmetries in the Yukawa sector, in a good approximation up to the first order of seij, the leptonic CKM-type mixing matrix in the mass eigenstates of leptons may be expressed as the following simplified form

[formula]

The three vector-like heavy Majorana neutrino masses are obtained via diagonalizing the mass matrix MN, i.e., [formula]

[formula]

with

[formula]

The masses of three left-handed light Majorana neutrinos are given in the physics basis as follows

[formula]

with [formula], [formula], m0  =  (mDν)2 / MR and m1  =  (mDN)2 / mN. It then enables us from the experimentally measured neutrino mass squire differences to extract two mass parameters m0 and m1 for a given value of parameter Δ with Δ  ≠  1.

The numerical results are presented in table 1 by taking the central values of the mass squire differences Δm221  =  m2νμ  -  m2νe  =  8  ×  10- 5 eV2 and Δm232  =  m2ντ  -  m2νμ  =  2.5  ×  10- 3 eV2.

Without losing generality, considering the case vν1  ≪  vν2,vν3, we then have the following approximate relations

[formula]

which shows that in this case both the mixing angle θν and the ratio r can be determined for the given values of Δ, an interesting solution is

[formula]

For a numerical estimation, it is useful to investigate the following two interesting cases

[formula]

which allows us to present a reasonable estimation for θ13 and δν (see table 2).

where vν3  ≠  vν2 (i.e., r  ≠  1) should be a more general and reasonable case when no symmetry is imposed, the resulting mixing angle θ13 can be large enough to be detected. For the case II, both mixing angle θ13 and CP-violating phase δν are in general testable by the future neutrino experiments. For the typical range Δ≃0.72  ±  0.028, we are led to the most optimistic predictions for the mixing angle θ13 and CP-violating phase δν

[formula]

which can be tested in the future experiments.

When taking the Dirac type neutrino masses mDν and mDN to be at the order of (0.1  ~  1.0) MeV (i.e., at the same order of electron mass), and the mass parameter mDE≃(15  ~  25) GeV, we have the lightest vector-like Majorana neutrino masses and charged lepton mass to be

[formula]

which is at the electroweak scale and can be explored at LHC and ILC.

In conclusion, we have shown how the puzzles on the smallness of neutrino masses and the nearly tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing may simultaneously be understood in the flavor SO(3) gauge symmetry model with the mechanism of approximate global U(1) family symmetry. The vacuum structure of SO(3) symmetry breaking for the SO(3) tri-triplet Higgs bosons plays an important role. The mixing angle θ13 is in general nonzero and its typical values range from the experimentally allowed sensitivity to the current experimental bound. CP violation in the lepton sector is caused by a spontaneous symmetry breaking and can be significantly large for exploring via a long baseline neutrino experiment. A similar consideration can be extended to the quark sector, unlike the lepton sector with the features of Majorana neutrinos, the mechanism of approximate global U(1) family symmetry can be applied to understand the smallness of quark mixing angles.
