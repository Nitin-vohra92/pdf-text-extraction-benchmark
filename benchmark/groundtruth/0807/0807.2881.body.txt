Generalized Long-Moody representations of braid groups

Introduction

The braid group Bn is the group with presentation

[formula]

It has a rich and interesting representation theory [\cite=birman] [\cite=formanek].

D. D. Long, in joint work with J. Moody, gave a construction that inputs a representation of a certain semidirect product [formula] and outputs a new representation of Bn. At first this construction may not sound useful, since its input seems to be harder to come by than its output. However there are at least two factors in its favor. First, the output seems to be in some sense more sophisticated than the input. For example, one can start with a one dimensional representation and obtain the Burau representation. Second, the semidirect product [formula] is a subgroup of Bn + 1. Thus one can recursively apply the algorithm to construct a sequence of increasingly complicated representations of Bn for all n.

Let Fn be the free group [formula]. There is a well known action of Bn on Fn, which gives rise to a semidirect product [formula]. This requires an arbitrary choice of convention. In this paper, the relations are as follows.

gi + 1σi  =  σigi,

giσi  =  σigigi + 1g- 1i,

gjσi  =  σigj if [formula].

The following is Theorem 2.1 in [\cite=dL94], which Long credits to be a joint work with Moody.

Given a representation [formula] we may construct a representation [formula].

The method of construction can be summarized as follows. The representation ρ determines a system of local coefficients on the n-times punctured disk Dn. The first cohomology of Dn with these local coefficients then turns out to be isomorphic to [formula]. The braid group Bn is the mapping class group of Dn, so it has a natural induced action on this vector space. For details, see [\cite=dL94].

Long also describes how to explicitly compute the matrices for ρ+ in terms of the matrices for ρ. In this paper we will only use this more concrete (but less well motivated) definition.

In Section [\ref=sec:lm], we give a proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:lm]. In Section [\ref=sec:subgroup], we generalize the Long-Moody construction to subgroups of Bn. We then discuss important special cases of this construction. In Section [\ref=sec:gassner], we apply the construction to the pure braid group Pn, obtaining the Gassner representation as a special case. In Section [\ref=sec:lawrence], we describe how these methods can be used to obtain Lawrence's representations. These are of interest because they contain all representations of the Hecke algebra. Finally, in Section [\ref=sec:reduced], we give the "reduced" version of the Long-Moody construction.

For convenience, we will work with finite dimensional representations over the field [formula]. The construction works equally well for infinite dimensional representations, and for representations over any field or commutative ring.

Note that, while the main results of this paper are stated as Theorems and Corollaries and so on, they are really constructions. Taken literally, a statement of the form "Given one representation, we may construct another representation" is trivial. Of course, the interesting thing is the method of construction.

The universal Long-Moody representation

The aim of this section is to give a proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:lm]. Our proof is not exactly new, but it does make explicit an idea that is implicit in [\cite=dL94]. This is the idea of a representation we call the "universal Long-Moody representation".

Recall that we are given a representation [formula], and must construct a representation [formula]. First we define the "universal Long-Moody representation" of Bn. This is a homomorphism from Bn to the group of invertible n by nmatrices with entries in the group ring of [formula].

Let [formula] be the semidirect product as defined earlier. Let [formula] denote the group ring of this group. For [formula], let Ri be the following two by two matrix with entries in [formula].

[formula]

This is invertible.

[formula]

Let φ be the following homomorphism from Bn to the group of invertible n by n matrices with entries in [formula].

[formula]

Here, Ii - 1 and In - i - 1 are the appropriately sized identity matrices, and σi acts on the matrix by scalar multiplication on the left.

It remains to check that φ satisfies the braid relations. The most difficult is the braid relation

[formula]

One can verify this by direct calculation, using the relations in [formula].

Having defined φ, it is now easy to construct ρ+. Choose a finite basis for V. (This is not strictly necessary - we leave it to the reader to fill in the details when V is infinite dimensional.) The image of ρ now consists of square matrices. For any β∈Bn, let ρ+(β) be the block matrix obtained by applying ρ to each entry of φ(β). This is an element of [formula], as required.

The simplest nontrivial example of this construction is stated in the following proposition.

If [formula] is a one dimensional representation then [formula] is the unreduced Burau representation, up to specializing and rescaling.

Suppose [formula] is a one dimensional representation. The generators σi of Bn are all conjugate to each other, so must all be mapped to the same value [formula]. Similarly, the generators gi are all conjugate to each other in [formula], so must all be mapped to the same value [formula]. Then

[formula]

This is the familiar matrix of the unreduced Burau representation, rescaled by a factor of s.

The Long-Moody construction for subgroups of Bn.

Suppose G is a subgroup of Bn. Then [formula] is a subgroup of [formula]. The aim of this section is to prove the following theorem.

Given a subgroup G of Bn and a representation [formula], we may construct a representation [formula].

The construction is the same as that of Long and Moody. Given an element β∈G, we let ρ+(β) be the result of applying ρ to each of the entries in the matrix φ(β). We need only check that these entries lie in the domain of ρ. Thus it remains only to prove the following lemma.

If β∈Bn then every entry of the matrix φ(β) is of the form aβ for some [formula].

Write β as a word in the generators σi. Recall that φ(σi) is the scalar σi times a matrix with entries in [formula]. Thus φ(β) is a product of terms, each of which is either a scalar σ±  1i or a matrix with entries in [formula]. The product of the terms σ±  1i in this product, taken in order, is equal to β.

Observe that if A is any matrix with entries in [formula] and σi is a generator of Bn then σiA is equal to A'σi for some matrix A' with entries in [formula]. To see this, apply the relations of [formula] to each term in each entry of A. By using this observation repeatedly, we can move the terms σ±  1i to the right of the product expression for φ(β). We obtain an expression of the form Aβ, where A is a matrix with entries in [formula].

The Gassner representation

Let Pn denote the pure braid group. The aim of this section is to prove the following theorem.

Given a representation [formula] we may construct an n parameter family of representations [formula].

Long achieved a similar result by different methods in [\cite=dL89] and [\cite=dL89-2]. The construction there uses an action of the braid group by diffeomorphisms on a certain representation variety. To obtain a linear representation, he takes the derivative of this action at any point that is fixed by the action of Bn, or Pn. Long was most interested in the Gassner representation, but the approach is quite general, and could give a result similar to Theorem [\ref=thm:gassner].

Our construction is more along the lines of [\cite=dL94], especially the following theorems, which are [\cite=dL94] and [\cite=dL94] respectively.

Given a representation ρ of Bn + 1, we may construct a new representation ρ+ of Bn.

Given a representation ρ of [formula], we may construct a one parameter family of representations ρ+t of Bn.

The first follows immediately from the fact that [formula] is a subgroup of Bn + 1. The second uses ρ to define a one parameter family of representations ρt of [formula], and then applies the Long-Moody construction to these. The representations ρt are just "rescalings" of ρ, but the resulting family of representations ρ+t is often more interesting than ρ+.

To prove Theorem [\ref=thm:gassner], we apply the same ideas in the context of the pure braid group.

Let Fn be the subgroup of Pn + 1 consisting of all braids in which the first n strands are straight. This is the free group with generators

[formula]

Let Pn be a subgroup of Pn + 1 in the usual way. It is well known that Pn and Fn together generate Pn + 1. Indeed, Pn + 1 is isomorphic to the subgroup [formula], of our semidirect product [formula].

Fix [formula]. Let [formula] be the representation such that

[formula]

for any of the generators gi of Fn, and

[formula]

for any β∈Pn.

To see that [formula] is well defined, note that if β∈Pn and [formula] then

[formula]

for some w∈Fn. These relations determine the semidirect product structure of Pn + 1, and they are preserved by [formula].

Now simply apply Theorem [\ref=thm:subgroup] to [formula] to obtain the desired representation of Pn.

As an example, we compare the results of Theorems [\ref=thm:parameter] and [\ref=thm:gassner] when ρ is the trivial representation. If ρ is the trivial representation of [formula] then Theorem [\ref=thm:parameter] gives the unreduced Burau representation ρ+t of Bn (by Proposition [\ref=prop:burau]). If ρ is the trivial representation of Pn + 1 then [formula] is the unreduced Gassner representation of Pn.

For more sophisticated examples, we could think of Theorem [\ref=thm:gassner] as giving a "Gassner" version of representations of Bn other than the Burau representation.

Lawrence's construction.

The Hecke algebra is a certain quotient of the group algebra [formula]. For our purposes, a representation of the Hecke algebra is any representation ρ of Bn such that the matrices ρ(σi) all satisfy a quadratic relation. Such representations are the subject of a large body of ongoing research [\cite=mathas] [\cite=stephen].

The following proposition suggests a connection between the representation φ from Section [\ref=sec:lm] and representations of the Hecke algebra.

(φ(σi)  +  σigiI)(φ(σi)  -  σiI)  =  0.

This can be checked by direct calculation. However it does not qualify as a representation of the Hecke algebra, since the "scalars" of this quadratic relation lie in a non-commutative ring.

By rescaling, it suffices to consider representations of Bn that satisfy

[formula]

for some [formula]. For generic values of q, such representations of Bn can be enumerated by the partitions of n. In [\cite=rL93], Lawrence gives a topological construction of the representations of the Hecke algebra that correspond to partitions of n of the form (n - m,m). This was generalized to all partitions in [\cite=rL96].

In [\cite=dL94], Long describes how his construction can be used to parallel that of [\cite=rL93]. The methods in this section are intended to parallel those of [\cite=rL96] (which had not appeared at the time of [\cite=dL94]). We will not prove any concrete connection. To do that would require a thorough treatment of the homological details behind the Long-Moody construction. Instead, this section could be viewed as a self contained description of a way to construct representations of the Hecke algebra.

Let Bn,m denote the set of braids in Bn + m such that the first n nodes at the bottom are connected to the first n nodes at the top, and (hence) the last m nodes at the bottom are connected to the last m nodes at the top. This is generated by

[formula]

Given a representation [formula], we may construct a representation [formula].

Let Bn,m be a subgroup of Bn,m + 1 in the obvious way. Let Fn + m be the set of braids in Bn,m + 1 such that the first n + m strands are straight. This is the free group with generators

[formula]

Then Bn,m and Fn + m together generate a subgroup [formula] of Bn,m + 1. The result now follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:subgroup].

Given a representation [formula], we may construct a one parameter family of representations [formula], where [formula] and [formula].

Suppose we are given [formula] and [formula]. Let [formula] be the representation such that

ρ'(σi)  =  1 for [formula],

ρ'(σ2n)  =  q,

ρ'(σn + i)  =  ρ(σi) for [formula].

Now apply Lemma [\ref=lem:lawrence] to ρ' recursively m times to obtain the desired representation of Bn.

For example, suppose ρ is the one dimensional representation of B2 given by ρ(σ1)  =  t, where [formula]. Then ρ+q is the Lawrence-Krammer representation [\cite=rL93] [\cite=krammer].

By analogy to [\cite=rL96], we expect the representation ρ+q to be especially interesting in when

[formula]

However Lawrence still has to do some more work to obtain a representation of the Hecke algebra as a subrepresentation of ρ+q. Rather than try to imitate this in our purely algebraic setting, we give an alternative construction that gives a representation of the Hecke algebra directly.

Given m  ≤  n and a representation [formula], we can construct a representation [formula], where there are [formula] copies of V in the direct sum. If ρ satisfies the relation (ρ(σi)  +  qI)(ρ(σi)  -  I)  =  0 then so does ρ+.

We start by constructing a "universal" Lawrence representation. Let 〈q〉 denote the infinite cyclic group generated by a formal variable q. Our universal Lawrence representation will be a homomorphism φ from Bn to the group of invertible [formula] by [formula] matrices with entries in [formula]. Enumerate the rows and columns of this matrix by basis vectors [formula] for [formula].

To make the definition more readable, we first fix some notation. Let [formula] denote a sequence of the form [formula], where [formula]. Let [formula] denote a sequence of the form [formula], where [formula]. In each of the following, assume that j and k are such that the length of the whole sequence is n.

[formula]

We must check that φ satisfies the braid relations, so that it gives a well defined representation of Bn. This is done by direct computation and checking cases. We will only describe some special cases that give a flavor of the general proof.

If m = 0 then φ is the trivial representation.

If m = 1 then φ is the unreduced Burau representation.

If m = n then φ maps each braid β to the one by one matrix

[formula]

(φ(σ) + qI)(φ(σ) - I)

[formula]

(q+σ)(1-σ)

[formula]

(ρ(σ) + qI)(ρ(σ) - I) = 0.

[formula]

The reduced Long-Moody construction.

The unreduced Burau representation obtained in Proposition [\ref=prop:burau] is reducible. It is the direct sum of a one dimensional representation with the reduced Burau representation. In [\cite=dL94], Long shows that this happens in general. We record here how to compute the "reduced" version of the Long-Moody construction.

For [formula], let Si be the following three by three matrix with entries in [formula].

[formula]

This is invertible.

[formula]

Let φr be the following homomorphism from Bn to the group of invertible n - 1 by n - 1 matrices with entries in [formula].

[formula]

If i is 1 or n - 1 then part of S is "cut off" by the edge of the matrix. In other words,
