Critical properties of 1D spin-gapped fermions at the onset of magnetization

Spin-charge separation is a distinctive feature of one dimensional (1D) multicomponent fermionic/bosonic systems. In contrast to the Fermi liquid picture, elementary excitations in 1D systems are not quasiparticles carrying both spin and charge, but rather spin and charge waves that propagate with different velocities [\cite=Gogolin]. This has been addressed in a number of experimental studies and demonstrated, in particular, in experiments with quantum wires in semiconductors [\cite=Auslaender]. Currently, there is a growing interest in revealing effects of spin-charge separation in experiments with cold Fermi gases [\cite=Kollath], where the 1D regime has been recently achieved [\cite=Esslinger] [\cite=Pitaevskii].

Spin-charge separation manifests itself within effective field theory (bosonization) after linearizing the excitation spectrum at the Fermi points. However, the linearization brings in additional symmetries, for example Lorentz invariance, and protects the system from the subtle effect of spin-charge interaction. The interaction between spin and charge degrees of freedom is seen in exact solutions for integrable systems, for instance in the Fermi Hubbard model for spin-1 / 2 fermions [\cite=Frahm] [\cite=Woynarovich91] [\cite=Penc] [\cite=brazovski]. In this case the spin-charge coupling can also be treated by bosonization accounting for the curvature of the spectrum at the Fermi points [\cite=brazovski]. In the presence of two gapless modes, this leads to charge transfer by spin excitations [\cite=brazovski].

One of the achievements of bosonization is the description of the commensurate-incommensurate (C-IC) phase transition for spin-gapped fermions, where the gap is closed by a critical magnetic field and a universal square root field dependence of the magnetization emerges at half filling[\cite=Japaridze] [\cite=Pokrovski]. We show how away from half filling the spin-charge interaction leads to a linear critical behavior of magnetization and to a finite susceptibility at the C-IC phase transition for a fixed number of particles. The spin-charge interaction enters the problem through the curvature of the spectrum at the Fermi points, and our effective field theory is applicable for a wide range of models, including continuum and extended Fermi Hubbard models with spin anisotropic interactions [\cite=Giamarchi] and/or mass (hopping) anisotropy [\cite=Cazalilla]. In fact, for the integrable Fermi Hubbard model with only on-site interactions, this type of critical behavior was already obtained from the Bethe Ansatz [\cite=Woynarovich91]. We give a transparent interpretation of this picture and show how the spin-charge interaction changes the behavior of correlation functions.

We first consider a dilute strong coupling limit for spin gapped fermions and obtain the magnetization across the C-IC transition. In this limit spin-[formula] and spin-[formula] fermions form strongly bound pairs and the density of the thermodynamic potential is:

[formula]

The fields ∂xφp, [formula] and ∂xθp, [formula] represent density and current fluctuations for the pairs and uncompensated (e.g., spin-[formula]) fermions [\cite=Gogolin], h is the magnetic field, the term W mimics a gap for spin excitations which is closed by a critical field hcr, μ is the chemical potential, and the multiple [formula] describes fluctuations of the total number of fermions. At a fixed μ the fields ∂xφp,∂xθp and [formula] are decoupled and one obtains the usual sine-Gordon like square root dependence of magnetization on the field [\cite=Japaridze] [\cite=Pokrovski]: [formula], for h  →  hcr + 0. At a constant number of particles we have a constraint [formula], which provides coupling between the fields of spin-[formula] fermions and pairs and, as we will see, modifies this square root dependence to a linear one [\cite=comment1]. At the critical field hcr = 2Δ, where 2Δ is equal to the binding energy of the pairs, the low-momentum dispersion relation for spin-[formula] fermions is [formula], with [formula] being their velocity. The bound pairs disperse linearly with velocity vp  ≠  0. Minimizing Ω ([\ref=heuristic]) with respect to ∂xφp and μ and expressing μ through magnetization we obtain:

[formula]

The appearance of the term linear in m under the square root is due to resolving the constraint. Equation ([\ref=magnetization]) gives m   =   (h   -   hcr) / πvp for h   →   hcr   +   0, and the susceptibility is

[formula]

We now turn to the spin and charge basis and derive from microscopic principles an asymptotically exact theory near the critical point. Taking into account the curvature of the spectrum at the Fermi points [\cite=brazovski] [\cite=Haldane81], the low-energy Hamiltonian density in the weak coupling limit can be written as:

[formula]

where the subscripts c and s stand for the charge and spin sectors. The fields ∂xφc and ∂xθc describe fluctuations of the charge (mass) density and current, while ∂xφs and ∂xθs are fluctuations of the spin density and spin current, with [formula] and [formula]. The Hamiltonian ([\ref=nonabelian]) is applicable for a wide range of models for spin-1 / 2 fermions, including continuum and extended Hubbard models. The coupling constant gs, Luttinger parameters Kc,s, and deviations of the charge/spin velocities vc,s from the Fermi velocity vF depend on the Fourier transforms of the interaction potential at wavevectors k = 0 and k = 2kF [\cite=Gogolin]. For spin-gapped fermions which are SU(2) symmetric at h < hcr, one has gs < 0, Ks = 1 + gs / 2, and the charge sector is gapless.

Compared to the standard bosonized Hamiltonian which is quadratic in currents and spin-charge separated, Eq.([\ref=nonabelian]) has an extra (cubic) term [\cite=Haldane81] [\cite=brazovski] [\cite=Teber] accounting for the curvature of the free spectrum at the Fermi points. It couples the spin and charge sectors and is proportional to [formula]. The cubic terms within the charge sector are omitted in Eq.([\ref=nonabelian]) as they are irrelevant modifications of the linearly dispersing charge mode. Dimensionally the curvature term is irrelevant as it has the scaling dimension equal to 3 > 1 + 1. However, as we will argue, this term can not be dropped near the critical point where the magnetic field closes the gap, because it couples the spin and charge sectors.  We will show how this coupling effects the magnetic susceptibility at the critical point when magnetization sets in.

For finding the susceptibility at a given number of particles we have to impose a constraint: [formula], which allows us to integrate out the charge modes. We calculate the contribution of the curvature term to the ground state energy at the onset of magnetization, confining ourselves to the terms proportional to m2. For extracting these terms we write [formula], with the symbol :: standing for the normal ordering. Then, after integrating out charge degrees of freedom, the Euclidean action is Seff = S0s + Sκ, where S0s is the action of the sine- Gordon model at magnetization m  →  0, which does not give rise to an m2 contribution in the ground state energy[\cite=Japaridze] [\cite=Pokrovski]. Retaining only contributions proportional to m2, the term Sκ originating from the spin-charge interaction is given by:

[formula]

Here τ = ivFt is the Euclidean time, [formula], and [formula]. For simplicity we put Kc = 1 and vc = vs = vF, which does not affect our main results, and the propagator for the charge sector is [formula], where a is a short distance cut-off.

The ground state energy, from which we have to extract the m2 contribution, is given by:

[formula]

where [formula] and we have written e- Sκ = 1 - Sκ + O(m4). As we see, Eq. ([\ref=Thevacuum]) involves the calculation of the expectation value of Sκ ([\ref=effective]) in the vacuum of the sine- Gordon theory at m  →  0.

For h = hcr + 0 the vacuum of effective theory contains infinitesimally small density of solitons. After normal ordering with respect to the vacuum at h = hcr + 0, the m2 contribution in Eq. ([\ref=Thevacuum]) can be extracted using the vacuum at h = hcr - 0 due to the relation:

[formula]

Eq. ([\ref=correl]) can be established from mapping the sine-Gordon model onto the massive Thirring model. Then at Ks = 1 / 2, where the spin sector is equivalent to free massive relativistic fermions, one easily gets Eq. ([\ref=correl]). For Ks  ≠  1 / 2 one finds that Eq. ([\ref=correl]) holds in any order of perturbation theory in the Thirring coupling constant.

On the other hand, for h < hc the magnetic field does not change the states of the system and only shifts the antisoliton and soliton energies by ~    ±  h so that the energy of a soliton-antisoliton pair remains the same. Since [formula] has nonzero matrix elements only between the states which can differ from each other by a certain number of soliton-antisoliton pairs [\cite=Smirnov], the correlation function [formula] for h = hcr - 0 is the same as at h = 0. At h = 0, due to the Euclidean invariance we have: [formula], where [formula] is the radial variable. The expectation value [formula] is given by Eq. ([\ref=effective]), with the products [formula] replaced by the corresponding correlation functions. Then, after integrating over the angular variable, the non-local terms of the first line of Eq. ([\ref=effective]) and those of the second line cancel each other. Accordingly, the averaged integrand in Eq. ([\ref=effective]) reduces to:

[formula]

This means that the m2 contribution to E0 ([\ref=Thevacuum]) can be obtained by using a simplified effective action:

[formula]

One thus sees that the effect boils down to the renormalization of the Luttinger parameter of the spin sector (increase of Ks) with m2:

[formula]

Note that for spin-gapped fermions which are SU(2) symmetric at h < hc Eq. ([\ref=Lutincrease]) encodes breaking of the SU(2) symmetry.

From the rescaling of the Luttinger parameter determined by Eq. ([\ref=Lutincrease]) we obtain the following m2 contribution to the ground state energy:

[formula]

For the inverse susceptibility Eq. ([\ref=Energy]) then yields:

[formula]

where E0 stands for the ground state energy density of the sine- Gordon model. For Ks  →  1 we can follow the RG procedure[\cite=Amit] [\cite=Kosterlitz] in order to extract the leading universal contribution to the ground state energy density of the sine-Gordon model. In the one-loop approach we have E0 =  - λΔ2 / vF, where Δ is the soliton mass (gap), and λ is a positive factor which we will fix later for the SU(2) sine- Gordon case. One- loop RG estimate of soliton mass is [\cite=Amit] [\cite=Kosterlitz] [\cite=Dzyaloshinskii]:

[formula]

Finally, from Eq. ([\ref=mainformula]) in the vicinity of the SU(2) separatrix we obtain:

[formula]

up to subleading contributions.

Equation ([\ref=susceptibility]) is valid for a wide class of generic models, including those with the spin anisotropy. Strictly speaking, the Hamiltonian ([\ref=nonabelian]) requires small gs and Ks close to unity. Nevertheless, one can think of extending our results to Ks away from unity, in particular to the Luther-Emery point Ks  →  1 / 2. Then, it is straightforward to evaluate χ- 1 by mapping the spin sector onto free massive fermions, which gives: [formula].

The most important result is that the susceptibility at the commensurate- incommensurate phase transition stays finite if the curvature is finite: κ  ≠  0. At the onset of magnetization the susceptibility is finite also for free fermions, where Δ = 0 and χ  ~  v- 1F. However, as we see from Eq.([\ref=susceptibility]), in the limit of Δ  →  0 the susceptibility diverges. This was previously observed for the Hubbard model [\cite=Woynarovich91] and attributed to a singular character of the zero interaction point.

In the case of integrable Fermi Hubbard model with only on-site attractive interaction U < 0, one has 1 - Ks≃|U| / 2πvF and the result of Eq. ([\ref=susceptibility]) is similar to the Bethe Ansatz calculation in the weak coupling limit [\cite=Woynarovich91]: χ- 1(|U  →  0) = 8κ2π3Δ2 / vFU2. This implies that the factor λ is equal to 3 / 2π on the SU(2) line.

For strong coupling the Bethe Ansatz inverse susceptibility is given by χ- 1(|U|  →    ∞  ) = 2π2ν(1 - ν)2 / |U| [\cite=Woynarovich91], which at a low filling factor ν tends to our strong coupling result ([\ref=scl]), with vp = 2πν / |U|.

We now analyze the behavior of pair and single fermion correlation functions at the onset of magnetization (h > hcr and m  →  0) [\cite=assumption]. For the Hubbard model, using explicitly the dressed charge matrix [\cite=Essler], in the presence of two gapless modes one obtains an effective Hamiltonian density[\cite=Penc] [\cite=Cabra] [\cite=Liu]:

[formula]

The fields φ± and θ± are related to the spin and charge fields through the spin-charge mixing parameter ξ:

[formula]

and v±, K± are the Bethe Ansatz velocities and Luttinger parameters for the ±   sectors. For m  →  0 we have [formula], K-  →  1 / 2 at any U and ν [\cite=Vekua]. In the case of half filling (ν = 1) one has K+ = 1, ξ = 0 for all |U|, and there is an exact spin-charge separation so that the fields φ±,θ± coincide with φc,s,θc,s. For ν < 1 one has

[formula]

at |U|  →  0, with the Fermi velocity vF = 2 sin πν  /  2 , and K+ = 2, ξ = 1 - ν, v+ = 2πν / |U| for |U|  →    ∞  . So, the parameter of spin-charge mixing, ξ, ranges from 0 to (1 - ν) and monotonically increases with |U|. The effective Hamiltonian ([\ref=efftheory]) is obtained through the Bethe Ansatz calculation and for the inverse susceptibility it naturally gives the exact result[\cite=Woynarovich91]: χ- 1  =  2πv+ξ2 / K+.

Asymptotic behavior of correlation functions for the Hubbard model with a repulsive on-site interaction, in the presence of two gapless modes (and in the presence of magnetic field) was obtained by Frahm and Korepin [\cite=Frahm]. Critical exponents for the general case have been obtained from a numerical solution of the coupled Bethe Ansatz integral equations for the dressed charge matrix. The effective Hamiltonian ([\ref=efftheory]) was constructed by Penc and Sólyom in such a way that it reproduces the Bethe Ansatz behavior of correlation functions [\cite=Penc]. This procedure of obtaining an effective Hamiltonian was retranslated to the case of attractive Hubbard model by using the particle hole transformation [\cite=Liu].

The limit of m  →  0 allows us to derive analytical expressions for the critical exponents of the correlation functions and make a number of physical conclusions. For the pair correlation function from Eq. ([\ref=efftheory]) we obtain:

[formula]

whereas for h < hcr it is ~  x- 1 / K+. There is a universal jump of 0.5 in the critical exponent, the result that is expected from the theory based on spin-charge separation. However, for the single fermion Green function we find:

[formula]

where [formula] is the Fermi momentum of spin-up (down) fermions given by the free value. The critical exponent of the majority (spin-up) component is [formula], and for the spin-down component we obtain [formula]. The presence of an additional spin-charge mixing term ~  ξ in the critical exponent of the single fermion Green function suggests that [formula] even in the limit of m  →  0, which is a clear signature of spin-charge coupling. Persistence of spin- charge coupling down to m  →  0 limit was recently observed numerically [\cite=Rizzi]. The difference [formula] increases with |U| for weak coupling, reaches its maximum in the regime of intermediate coupling, and then decreases with increasing |U| in the strong coupling regime. Thus, the effect of spin-charge mixing is the most pronounced at an intermediate coupling strength.

In conclusion, we showed that the curvature couples spin and charge modes for m  →  0 and changes critical properties of 1D spin gapped fermions at the onset of magnetization. Two-component Fermi gas in a 1D optical lattice is well suited for revealing spin-charge separation or observing spin-charge coupling, especially in a box potential where ν is coordinate independent. Periodic modulations of the box size can only excite in-phase oscillations of the two components (charge oscillations), and they will not excite out-of-phase oscillations (spin mode) at half filling where exact spin-charge separation holds. In contrast, for a significantly smaller filling factor the excitation of these modes will be provided by spin-charge coupling.
