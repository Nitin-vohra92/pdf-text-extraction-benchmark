The Spectrum and the Spectral Type of the Off-Diagonal Fibonacci Operator

Introduction

The study of the Fibonacci operator was initiated in the early 1980's by Kohmoto et al. [\cite=kkt] and Ostlund et al. [\cite=oprss]. At that point in time, the interest in this model was based mainly on the existence of an exact renormalization group procedure and the appearance of critical eigenstates and zero measure Cantor spectrum. Only shortly thereafter, Shechtman et al. [\cite=sbgc] reported their discovery of structures, now called quasicrystals, whose diffraction exhibits sharp Bragg peaks with rotational symmetries that ensure the aperiodicity of the structure in question.

The Fibonacci sequence is the central model of a quasicrystal in one dimension. Indeed, it is aperiodic and pure point diffractive and, moreover, it belongs to virtually all classes of mathematical models of quasicrystals that have since been proposed. We refer to the reader to [\cite=BM] for a relatively recent account of the mathematics related to the modelling and study of quasicrystals.

Thus, the study of the Fibonacci operator was further motivated by the interest in electronic spectra and transport properties of one-dimensional quasicrystals. Consequently, apart from the almost Mathieu operator, the Fibonacci operator has been the most heavily studied quasi-periodic operator in the last three decades; compare the survey articles [\cite=D00] [\cite=D07] [\cite=S95].

Partly due to the choice of the model in the foundational papers [\cite=kkt] [\cite=oprss], the mathematical literature on the Fibonacci operator has so far only considered the diagonal model, that is, a discrete one-dimensional Schrödinger operator with potential given by the Fibonacci sequence. Given the connection to quasicrystals and hence aperiodic point sets, and particularly cut-and-project sets, it is however equally (if not more) natural to study the off-diagonal model. That is, one considers a Jacobi matrix with zero diagonal and off-diagonals given by the Fibonacci sequence. This would correspond to hopping over unequal distances, the sites being points on the real line generated by the cut-and-project scheme that produces the Fibonacci point set. While we will not explain these concepts here in detail, we do refer the reader to [\cite=BM] for background and we will describe the resulting model carefully in the next section. For further motivation to study the off-diagonal model, we mention that it has been the object of interest in a number of physics papers; see, for example, [\cite=EL06] [\cite=EL08] [\cite=kst] [\cite=RP] [\cite=VP] [\cite=YYXZZ].

In fact, our interest in the off-diagonal model was triggered by the numerical results for separable higher-dimensional models obtained recently by Even-Dar Mandel and Lifshitz in [\cite=EL06] [\cite=EL08]. We intend to explore the observations reported in these papers and prove some of the phenomena rigorously, and for this task, we will need the basic spectral results for the off-diagonal Fibonacci operator obtained in this paper.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=s.s1] we describe in detail the model we study and the results we obtain for it. The results concerning the spectrum as a set are proved in Section [\ref=s.s2] and the results concerning the spectral type are proved in Section [\ref=s.s3].

Model and Results

In this section we describe the off-diagonal Fibonacci operator and the results for it that are proved in subsequent sections. Let a,b be two positive real numbers and consider the Fibonacci substitution,

[formula]

This substitution rule extends to finite and one-sided infinite words by concatenation. For example, S(aba)  =  abaab. Since S(a) begins with a, one obtains a one-sided infinite sequence that is invariant under S by iterating the substitution rule on a and taking a limit. Indeed, we have

[formula]

In particular, Sk(a) starts with Sk - 1(a) and hence there is a unique one-sided infinite sequence u, the so-called Fibonacci substitution sequence, that starts with Sk(a) for every k. The hull Ωa,b is then obtained by considering all two-sided infinite sequences that locally look like u,

[formula]

It is known that, conversely, every subword of u is a subword of every ω∈Ωa,b. In this sense, u and all elements of the hull ω look exactly the same locally.

We wish to single out a special element of Ωa,b. Notice that ba occurs in u and that S2(a)  =  aba begins with a and S2(b)  =  ab ends with b. Thus, iterating S2 on b|a, where | denotes the eventual origin, we obtain as a limit a two-sided infinite sequence which belongs to Ωa,b and coincides with u to the right of the origin. This element of Ωa,b will be denoted by ωs.

Each ω∈Ωa,b generates a Jacobi matrix Hω acting in [formula],

[formula]

With respect to the standard orthonormal basis [formula] of [formula], where δn is one at n and vanishes otherwise, this operator has the matrix

[formula]

and it is clearly self-adjoint.

This family of operators, {Hω}ω∈Ωa,b, is called the off-diagonal Fibonacci model. Of course, the structure of the Fibonacci sequence disappears when a  =  b. In this case, the hull consists of a single element, the constant two-sided infinite sequence taking the value a  =  b, and the spectrum and the spectral measures of the associated operator Hω are well understood. For this reason, we will below always assume that [formula]. Nevertheless, the limiting case, where we fix a, say, and let b tend to a is of definite interest.

Our first result concerns the spectrum of Hω. For [formula], we denote by [formula] the Hausdorff dimension of S and by [formula] the box counting dimension of S (which is then implicitly claimed to exist); see [\cite=DEGT] or [\cite=PT] for the definition of these fractal dimensions.

Suppose a,b  >  0 and [formula]. Then, there exists a compact set [formula] such that σ(Hω)  =  Σa,b for every ω∈Ωa,b, and

Σa,b has zero Lebesgue measure.

The Hausdorff dimension dim HΣa,b is an analytic function of a and b.

0 <  dim HΣa,b < 1.

Also, there exists ε0 > 0 such that if [formula] (in other words, if a and b are close enough ), then

The spectrum Σa,b is a Cantor set that depends continuously on a and b in the Hausdorff metric.

For every small δ > 0 and every E∈Σa,b, we have

[formula]

Denote α  =   dim HΣa,b, then the Hausdorff α-measure of Σa,b is positive and finite.

Properties (ii)-(vi) are related to hyperbolicity of the trace map described in the next section, see [\cite=Can] [\cite=Cas] [\cite=DG]. It is reasonable to expect that in fact the properties (iv)-(vi) for Σa,b hold for all positive a  ≠  b, but one of the steps in the proof is currently missing as will be explained in Section [\ref=s.s2].

Next, we turn to the spectral type of Hω.

Suppose a,b  >  0 and [formula]. Then, for every ω∈Ωa,b, Hω has purely singular continuous spectrum.

Throughout the rest of the paper we will only consider a,b  >  0 with [formula]. Theorem [\ref=t.main1] is proved in Section [\ref=s.s2] and Theorem [\ref=t.main2] is proved in Section [\ref=s.s3].

The Trace Map and its Relation to the Spectrum

The spectral properties of Hω are closely related to the behavior of the solutions to the difference equation

[formula]

Denote

[formula]

Then u solves [\eqref=f.eve] (for every [formula]) if and only if U solves

[formula]

(for every [formula]), where

[formula]

Note that det Tω(n,E)  =  1. Iterating [\eqref=f.tmatrix], we find

[formula]

where

[formula]

With the Fibonacci numbers {Fk}, generated by F0  =  F1  =  1, Fk + 1  =  Fk  +  Fk - 1 for k  ≥  1, we define

[formula]

For example, we have

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

We have

[formula]

for k  ≥  2. Moreover, the quantity

[formula]

is independent of both k and E and it is given by

[formula]

Since ωs restricted to {n  ≥  1} coincides with u and the prefixes sk of u of length Fk obey sk + 1  =  sksk - 1 for k  ≥  2 by construction (cf. [\eqref=f.fibrec]), the recursion [\eqref=f.tmrec] follows as in the diagonal case; compare [\cite=D00] [\cite=D07] [\cite=S87]. This recursion in turn implies readily that [\eqref=f.tminv] is k-independent.

In particular, the xk's are again generated by the trace map

[formula]

and the preserved quantity is again

[formula]

The only difference between the diagonal and the off-diagonal model can be found in the initial conditions. How are x1,x0,x- 1 obtained? Observe that the trace map is invertible and hence we can apply its inverse twice to the already defined quantity (x3,x2,x1). We have

[formula]

and hence, using [\eqref=f.tmic],

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

for every k  ≥  0.

It is of crucial importance for the spectral analysis that, as in the diagonal case, the invariant is energy-independent and strictly positive when [formula]!

The spectrum of Hω is independent of ω and may be denoted by Σa,b. With

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Moreover, for every E∈Σa,b and k  ≥  2,

[formula]

and for [formula], |xk| diverges super-exponentially.

It is well known that the hull Ωa,b together with the standard shift transformation is minimal. In particular, every ω∈Ωa,b may be approximated pointwise by a sequence of shifts of any other ∈Ωa,b. The associated operators then converge strongly and we get [formula]. Reversing the roles of ω and [formula], the first claim follows.

So let Σa,b denote the common spectrum of the operators Hω, ω∈Ωa,b. We have [formula]. Thus, Σa,b  ⊆  [ -    max {2a,2b}, max {2a,2b}] = :Ia,b. For E∈Ia,b, we have that at least one of x1, x0 belongs to

[formula]

, we have a result analogous to [\cite=S87] with the same proof as given there. Namely, the sequence {xk}k  ≥  0 is unbounded if and only if there exists k such that |xk| > 1 and |xk + 1|  >  1. Moreover, we then have |xk  +  l|  >  cFl for some c  >  1 and all l  ≥  0. This shows

[formula]

Using now the fact that the Fk periodic Jacobi matrices with spectrum σk converge strongly to Hωs, we obtain

[formula]

since the spectra σk and σk + 1 are closed sets. Thus, we have one inclusion in [\eqref=f.descspec].

Next, suppose [formula] If k  ≥  1 is such that |xk|  >  1, then |xk - 1|  ≤  1 and |xk + 1|  ≤  1. Since we have

[formula]

this implies

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

which, using |xk - 1|  ≤  1 and |xk + 1|  ≤  1 again, implies the estimate [\eqref=t.tmbound] for [formula]. We will show in the next section that the boundedness of the sequence {xk}k  ≥  0 implies that, for arbitrary ω∈Ωa,b, no solution of the difference equation [\eqref=f.eve] is square-summable at +    ∞  . Consequently, such E's belong to Σa,b. This shows the other inclusion in [\eqref=f.descspec] and hence establishes it. Moreover, it follows that [\eqref=t.tmbound] holds for every E∈Σa,b.

Finally, from the representation [\eqref=f.descspec] of Σa,b and our observation above about unbounded sequences {xk}k  ≥  0, we find that |xk| diverges super-exponentially for [formula]. This concludes the proof of the lemma.

For every [formula], there is γ(E)  ≥  0 such that

[formula]

uniformly in ω∈Ωa,b.

This follows directly from the uniform subadditive ergodic theorem; compare [\cite=DL99] [\cite=DL06] [\cite=H93] [\cite=L02].

The set [formula] has zero Lebesgue measure.

This is one of the central results of Kotani theory; see [\cite=K89] and also [\cite=D07b]. Note that these papers only discuss the diagonal model. Kotani theory for Jacobi matrices is discussed in Carmona-Lacroix [\cite=CL90] and the result needed can be deduced from what is presented there. For a recent reference that states a result sufficient for our purpose explicitly, see Remling [\cite=R07].

We have Σa,b  =  Za,b.

The inclusion Σa,b  ⊇  Za,b holds by general principles. For example, one can construct Weyl sequences by truncation when γ(E)  =  0. The inclusion Σa,b  ⊆  Za,b can be proved in two ways. Either one uses the boundedness of xk for energies E∈Σa,b to prove explicit polynomial upper bounds for [formula] (as in [\cite=IT91] for ω  =  ωs or in [\cite=DL99] for general ω∈Ωa,b), or one combines the proof of the absence of decaying solutions at +    ∞   for E∈Σa,b given in the next section with Osceledec's Theorem, which states that γ(E)  >  0 would imply the existence of an exponentially decaying solution at +    ∞  . Here we use one more time that Un is comparable in norm to (un,un - 1)T.

The existence of the uniform spectrum Σa,b was shown in Lemma [\ref=l.l3] and the fact that Σa,b has zero Lebesgue measure follows from Lemmas [\ref=l.l4] and [\ref=l.l5]. The set of bounded orbits of the restriction of the trace map [formula] to the invariant surface [formula] is hyperbolic; see [\cite=Can] (and also [\cite=DG] for C sufficiently small and [\cite=Cas] for C sufficiently large). Due to Lemma [\ref=l.l2], the points of the spectrum correspond to the points of the intersection of the line of the initial conditions

[formula]

with the stable manifolds of the hyperbolic set of bounded orbits. Properties (ii) and (iii) can be proved in exactly the same way as Theorem 6.5 in [\cite=Can]. The line la,b intersects the stable lamination of the hyperbolic set transversally for sufficiently small C  >  0, as can be shown in the same way as for the diagonal Fibonacci Hamiltonian with a small coupling constant; see [\cite=DG]. Therefore the spectrum Σa,b for close enough a and b is a dynamically defined Cantor set, and the properties (iv)-(vi) follow; see [\cite=DEGT] [\cite=DG] [\cite=Ma] [\cite=MM] [\cite=P] [\cite=PT] and references therein.

Notice that a proof of the transversality of the line la,b to the stable lamination of the hyperbolic set of bounded orbits for arbitrary a  ≠  b would imply the properties (iv)-(vi) for these values of a and b.

Singular Continuous Spectrum

In this section we prove Theorem [\ref=t.main2]. Given the results from the previous section, we can follow the proofs from the diagonal case quite closely.

Since the absence of absolutely continuous spectrum follows from zero measure spectrum, we only need to show the absence of point spectrum. It was shown by Damanik and Lenz [\cite=DL] that, given any ω∈Ωa,b and k  ≥  1, the restriction of ω to {n  ≥  1} begins with a square

[formula]

such that [formula] is a cyclic permutation of Sk(a). By cyclic invariance of the trace, it follows that [formula] for every E.

The Cayley-Hamilton Theorem, applied to Mω(Fk,E), says that

[formula]

which, by the observations above, translates to

[formula]

If E∈Σa,b and u is a solution of the difference equation [\eqref=f.eve], it therefore follows that

[formula]

If u does not vanish identically, this shows that [formula] as n  →    ∞   since the xk's are bounded above and the ωn's are bounded below away from zero. In particular, if E∈Σa,b, then no non-trivial solution of [\eqref=f.eve] is square-summable at +    ∞   and hence E is not an eigenvalue. It follows that the point spectrum of Hω is empty.
