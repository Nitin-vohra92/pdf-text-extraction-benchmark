Zeros of partial sums of the Riemann zeta-function

Although a great deal is known and conjectured about the distribution of zeros of the Riemann zeta-function, little is known about the zeros of its partial sums

[formula]

Here s = σ + it denotes a complex variable and X is at least 2. Exceptions are the works of P. Turán [\cite=Turan1948], [\cite=Turan1959], [\cite=Turan1960], [\cite=Turan1963], N. Levinson [\cite=Levinson1973], S. M. Voronin [\cite=Voronin1974], and H. L. Montgomery [\cite=Montgomery1983], and numerical studies by R. Spira [\cite=Spira] and, more recently, P. Borwein et al. [\cite=Bor]. Our goal here is to extend these investigations.

We write ρX  =  βX + iγX for a typical zero of FX(s). The number of these up to height T we denote by NX(T), and the number of these with βX  ≥  σ by NX(σ,T). We follow the convention that if T is the ordinate of a zero, then NX(T), say, is defined as lim ε  →  0+NX(T + ε).

There are two natural ways to pose questions about NX(T), NX(σ,T), and the distribution of the zeros generally. We can fix an X and consider zeros with 0 < γX  ≤  T and let T tend to infinity, or we can ask for results that are uniform as X and T both tend to infinity. Here we will be concerned with the latter sort of question.

Our first theorem collects together a number of known results.

The zeros of FX(s) lie in the strip α  <  σ  <  β, where α and β are the unique solutions of the equations [formula] and [formula], respectively. In particular, α >  - X and β < 1.72865. For X sufficiently large FX(s) has no zeros in the half-plane Moreover, for any constant c with c > 4 / π - 1 there exists a number X0(c) such that if X  ≥  X0(c), then FX(s) has at most a finite number of zeros in the half-plane

That the zeros all lie in a strip follows immediately from the fact that [formula] if [formula] or if [formula]. The estimates for α and β may be found in Borwein et al. [\cite=Bor]. The last two assertions are due to Turán [\cite=Turan1948] and Montgomery [\cite=Montgomery1983], respectively.

Let X,T  ≥  2. Then we have

Before beginning the proof we note that [formula], so that FX(s) has no zeros on the line [formula]. If t is not the ordinate of a zero, we define arg FX(σ + it) as the value obtained by continuous variation along the straight lines joining 2, 2 + it, and σ + it, starting with the value 0. If t is the ordinate of a zero, we let arg FX(σ + it)  =   lim ε  →  0+ arg FX(σ + i(t + ε)).

Let C be the rectangle with vertices at - U, 2, 2 + iT, and - U + iT, where U  ≥  X. Clearly FX(s) is nonzero on the right and bottom sides of C, and by Theorem [\ref=thm_1] it does not vanish on the left side. Without loss of generality, we may also assume FX(s) is nonzero on the top edge. By the argument principle, where [formula] denotes the change in argument around C taken in the positive direction. Because FX(s) is real and nonvanishing along

[formula]

Next, we estimate

[formula]

for σ  >  1 / 2. We follow one of the many classical approaches to zero density theorems (see Titchmarsh [\cite=Titchmarsh1986], Theorems 9.16 and 9.17) and do not strive for the strongest result.

Suppose that X  →    ∞   as T  →    ∞   and that X  ≪  T. Then uniformly for σ  ≥  1 / 2 + 1 /  log T.

Let T  ≥  2 and define where μ(n) is the Möbius function, and Y  ≥  2 is to be chosen later as a function of X and T. We have where Note that aX(n) = 1 if n = 1, and aX(n) = 0 if n < X or n > XY. Furthermore, |aX(n)|  ≤  d(n) for all n, where d(n) is the number of divisors of n.

Set Then hX(s) is holomorphic and vanishes at the zeros of FX(s). For σ  ≥  2 and X sufficiently large, Thus hX(s)  ≠  0 for σ  ≥  2 and X large. Applying Littlewood's lemma to hX(s) (see, for example, Titchmarsh [\cite=Titchmarsh1986], Section 9.9), we find that if σ0  ≥  1 / 2,

[formula]

Now so we have

[formula]

To obtain the estimate on the second line we have used Montgomery and Vaughan's [\cite=MontgomeryVaughan1974] mean value theorem for Dirichlet polynomials. Similarly,

[formula]

By a well-known lemma in Titchmarsh [\cite=Titchmarsh1986] (see Section 9.4), arg hX(s)  ≪   log XY for σ  ≥  1 / 2. Hence Combining this with the estimates [\eqref=left_side] and [\eqref=right_side] in [\eqref=Littlewood_formula], we obtain If σ0  ≥  1, the first term on the right dominates the others and, in this case, we let Y = 2. If 1 / 2  ≤  σ0 < 1, we set Y = CT / X, where C is a constant chosen large enough to ensure that Y  ≥  2. The first term on the right-hand side is again the dominant term, so we see that

Finally, we set σ0  <  σ1  ≤  2 with σ1  =  σ0  +  1 /  log T and obtain Therefore NX(σ1,T)  ≪  TX1 - 2σ1 log 6T uniformly for σ1  ≥  1 / 2 + 1 /  log T. This completes the proof of the theorem.

Our next result follows easily from the estimates for NX(T) and NX(σ,T) in Theorems [\ref=thm_2] and [\ref=thm_3].

Suppose that X  →    ∞   as T  →    ∞   and that X  ≪  T. There is an absolute constant c1 such that, for T sufficiently large,

[formula]

for almost all zeros of FX(s) with 0 < γX  ≤  T.

We can also prove a conditional result in the same vein.

Assume the Riemann Hypothesis. Suppose that X  →    ∞   as T  →    ∞   and that X  ≪  T. There exists an absolute constant c2 such that, for T sufficiently large,

[formula]

for all zeros of FX(s) with X1 / 2  <  γX  ≤  T.

By Theorem 4.1 of Gonek [\cite=Gonek2007] there is a positive constant A such that for σ bounded and ≥  1 / 2, |s - 1| > 1 / 10, and 9  ≤  X  ≤  t2. By Titchmarsh [\cite=Titchmarsh1986], equation (14.14.5), there is a positive constant B such that for σ  ≥  1 / 2  +  B /  log  log t. It follows that there is a positive constant C such that when In light of the constraint that X  ≤  t2, we see that FX(s)  ≠  0 for X1 / 2  ≤  t  ≤  T and The theorem follows.

We next show that zeros to the right of the line [formula] are on average close to it.

For 3  ≤  X  ≤  T we have

[formula]

By a straightforward application of Littlewood's lemma, we find that

[formula]

Applying the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality and Montgomery and Vaughan's mean value theorem, we obtain where the last line follows because log (1 + z)  ≪  z for |z| < 1 / 2. Combining this with [\eqref=Littlewood_10], we complete the proof of the theorem.

As a corollary, we obtain a result that is stronger than Theorem [\ref=thm_3] when (roughly) ( log T)ε - 6  ≪  σ - 1 / 2  ≪   log  log X /  log X.

Let X  ≤  T. Then for X and T sufficiently large

For σ  >  1 / 2 we have By Theorem [\ref=thm_dist_to_1/2], Hence

Let 2  ≤  X  ≤  T. For U  ≥  X we have

Applying Littlewood's lemma to FX(s), we find that

[formula]

Because |FX(2 + it)| is bounded above and below by positive constants, we see that [formula]. Also, as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_2], arg FX(σ) = 0 and arg FX(σ  +  iT)  ≪  X for σ  ≤  2. Thus [formula] and [formula]. Finally, note that and

[formula]

Therefore, we find that

[formula]

Inserting these estimates into [\eqref=Littlewood_20], we obtain

[formula]

This completes the proof of the theorem.

Let 2  ≤  X  ≤  T. Then we have In particular, if X  ≪  T1 / 2 and X  →    ∞  , then

[formula]

That is, the average of the abscissas of the zeros of FX(s) equals 0.

The first assertion follows in a straightforward way from Theorems [\ref=thm_1],  [\ref=thm_2], and [\ref=Sum_beta+U]. The second assertion follows immediately from the first and Theorem [\ref=thm_2].

Our final result provides information about the zeros of FX(s) for arbitrary values of [formula].

Let 2  ≤  X  ≤  T. Then uniformly for σ < 1 / 2 we have

Remark. Taking σ  =   - X in the theorem, we obtain According to Theorem [\ref=Sum_beta+U] with U = X, we in fact have equality here.

Let σ0 < 1 / 2. By Littlewood's lemma, As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=Sum_beta+U], [formula] and the second integral on the right is ≪  (1 + |σ0|)X. Thus

[formula]

Applying the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality and Montgomery and Vaughan's mean value theorem as before, we obtain Combining this and [\eqref=Littlewood], we obtain the theorem.

The main question we have left unanswered is whether one can prove an asymptotic estimate for the sum in Theorem [\ref=thm_dist_left_of_1/2]. For example, is it the case that

[formula]

when σ is bounded and less than 1 / 2, and X  →    ∞   with T? To answer this would require an asymptotic estimate rather than an upper bound for

[formula]

when σ < 1 / 2.
