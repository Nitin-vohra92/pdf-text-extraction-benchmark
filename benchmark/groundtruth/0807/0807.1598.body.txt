Introduction

Let M be a compact boundaryless smooth manifold.

Let [formula] be either the group [formula] or the trivial group ({0}, + ).

A Tonelli Lagrangian is a C2 function [formula] such that

The restriction to each fiber of [formula] is a convex function.

It is fiberwise superlinear:

[formula]

The Euler-Lagrange equation

[formula]

defines a complete flow [formula].

We say that a Tonelli Lagrangian L is strong Tonelli if L + u is a Tonelli Lagrangian for each [formula]. When [formula] we say that the lagrangian is autonomous.

Let P(L) be the set of Borel probability measures on [formula] which are invariant under the Euler-Lagrange flow φ. The action functional [formula] is defined as

[formula]

The functional AL is lower semi-continuous and the minimizers of AL on P(L) are called minimizing measures. The ergodic components of a minimizing measure are also minimizing, and they are mutually singular, so that the set [formula] of minimizing measures is a simplex whose extremal points are the ergodic minimizing measures.

In general, the simplex [formula] may be of infinite dimension. The goal of the present paper is to prove that this is a very exceptional phenomenon. The first results in that direction were obtained by Mañé in [\cite=Ma6]. His paper has been very influential to our work.

We say that a property is generic in the sense of Mañé if, for each strong Tonelli Lagrangian L, there exists a residual subset [formula] such that the property holds for all the Lagrangians L - u,u∈O. A set is called residual if it is a countable intersection of open and dense sets. We recall which topology is used on [formula]. Denoting by [formula] the Ck-norm of a function [formula], define

[formula]

Note that [formula] is not a norm. Endow the space [formula] with the translation-invariant metric [formula]. This metric is complete, hence the Baire property holds: any residual subset of [formula] is dense.

The main result of Mañé in [\cite=Ma6] is that having a unique minimizing measure is a generic property. This corresponds to the case where A is a point in our statement. Our generalization of Mañé's result is motivated by the following construction due to John Mather:

We can view a 1-form on M as a function on TM which is linear on the fibers. If λ is closed, the Euler-Lagrange equation of the Lagrangian L - λ is the same as that of L. However, the minimizing measures of L - λ, are not the same as the minimizing measures of L. Mather proves in [\cite=Mat5] that the set [formula] of minimizing measures of the lagrangian L - λ depends only on the cohomology class c of λ. If [formula] we write [formula], where λ is a closed form of cohomology c.

It turns out that important applications of Mather theory, such as the existence of orbits wandering in phase space, require understanding not only of the set [formula] of minimizing measures for a fixed or generic cohomology classes but of the set of all Mather minimizing measures for every c∈H1(M,L). The following corollaries are crucial for these applications.

We say that a property is of infinite codimension if, for each finite dimensional convex family A of strong Tonelli Lagrangians, there exists a residual subset O in [formula] such that none of the Lagrangians L - u, L∈A, u∈O satisfy the property.

Another important issue concerning variational methods for Arnold diffusion questions is the total disconnectedness of the quotient Aubry set. John Mather proves in [\cite=Mat10] that the quotient Aubry set [formula] of any Tonelli lagrangian on [formula] with [formula] and [formula] (or with [formula] and [formula]) is totally disconnected. See [\cite=Mat10] for its definition.

The elements of the quotient Aubry set are called static classes. They are disjoint subsets of [formula] and each static class supports at least one ergodic minimizing measure. We then get

Abstract Results

Assume that we are given

Three topological vector spaces E, F, G.

A continuous linear map π:F  →  G.

A bilinear pairing [formula].

Two metrizable convex compact subsets H  ⊂  F and K  ⊂  G such that π(H)  ⊂  K.

Suppose that

The map

[formula]

is continuous.

We will also denote 〈u,π(μ)〉 by 〈u,μ〉 when μ∈H. Observe that each element u∈E gives rise to a linear functional on F

[formula]

which is continuous on H. We shall denote by H* the set of affine and continuous functions on H and use the same symbol u for an element of E and for the element μ  ↦  〈u,μ〉 of H* which is associated to it.

The compact K is separated by E. This means that, if η and ν are two different points of K, then there exists a point u in E such that 〈u,η〉  ≠  〈u,ν〉.

Note that the topology on K is then the weak topology associated to E. A sequence ηn of elements of K converges to η if and only if we have 〈u,ηn〉  →  〈u,η〉 for each u∈E. We shall, for notational conveniences, fix once and for all a metric d on K.

E is a Frechet space. It means that E is a topological vector space whose topology is defined by a translation-invariant metric, and that E is complete for this metric.

Note then that E has the Baire property. We say that a subset is residual if it is a countable intersection of open and dense sets. The Baire property says that any residual subset of E is dense.

Given L∈H* denote by

[formula]

the set of points μ∈H which minimize L|H, and by MK(L) the image π(MH(L)). These are compact convex subsets of H and K.

Our main abstract result is:

We define the ε-neighborhood Vε of a subset V of K as the union of all the open balls in K which have radius ε and are centered in V. Given a subset D  ⊂  A, a positive number ε, and a positive integer k, denote by O(D,ε,k)  ⊂  E the set of points u∈E such that, for each L∈D, the convex set MK(L - u) is contained in the ε-neighborhood of some k-dimensional convex subset of K.

We shall prove that the theorem holds with

[formula]

If u belongs to O(A), then ([\ref=dim]) holds for every L∈A. Otherwise, for some L∈A, the convex set MK(L - u) would contain a ball of dimension [formula], and, if ε is small enough, such a ball is not contained in the ε-neighborhood of any convex set of dimension [formula].

So we have to prove that O(A) is residual. In view of the Baire property, it is enough to check that, for any compact subset D  ⊂  A and any positive ε, the set [formula] is open and dense. We shall prove in [\ref=open] that it is open, and in [\ref=dense] that it is dense.

Open

We prove that, for any [formula], ε > 0 and any compact D  ⊂  A, the set O(D,ε,k)  ⊂  E is open. We need a Lemma.

The set-valued map (L,u)  ↦  MH(L - u) is upper semi-continuous on A  ×  E. This means that for any open subset U of H, the set

[formula]

is open in A  ×  E. Consequently, the set-valued map (L,u)  ↦  MK(L - u) is also upper semi-continuous.

This is a standard consequence of the continuity of the map

[formula]

Now let u0 be a point of O(D,ε,k). For each L∈D, there exists a k-dimensional convex set V  ⊂  K such that MK(L - u0)  ⊂  Vε. In other words, the open sets of the form

[formula]

where V is some k-dimensional convex subset of K, cover the compact set D  ×  {u0}. So there exists a finite subcovering of D  ×  {u0} by open sets of the form Ωi  ×  Ui, where Ωi is an open set in A and Ui  ⊂  O(Ωi,ε,k) is an open set in E containing u0. We conclude that the open set [formula] is contained in O(D,ε,k), and contains u0. This ends the proof.

Dense

We prove the density of [formula] in E for ε > 0. Let w be a point in E. We want to prove that w is in the closure of [formula].

There exists an integer m and a continuous map

[formula]

with wi∈E such that

[formula]

where the diameter is taken for the distance d on K.

In K  ×  K, to each element w∈E we associate the open set

[formula]

Since E separates K, the open sets Uw,w∈E cover the complement of the diagonal in K  ×  K. Since this complement is open in the separable metrizable set K  ×  K, we can extract a countable subcovering from this covering. So we have a sequence Uwk, with wk∈E, which covers the complement of the diagonal in K  ×  K. This amounts to say that the sequence wk separates K. Defining [formula], we have to prove that [\eqref=diam] holds for m large enough. Otherwise, we would have two sequences ηm and μm in K such that

[formula]

By extracting a subsequence, we can assume that the sequences μm and ηm have different limits μ and η, which satisfy [formula]. Take m large enough, so that Tm(η)  ≠  Tm(μ). Such a value of m exists because the linear forms wk separate K. We have that

[formula]

Hence at the limit Tm(η) = Tm(μ). This is a contradiction.

Define the function [formula] as

[formula]

when x∈Tm(π(H)) and Fm(L,x) =  +   ∞   if [formula]. For [formula], let

[formula]

be the set of points which minimize the function x  ↦  Fm(L,x) - y  ·  x. We have that

[formula]

Let

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=map] it follows that

[formula]

Therefore, in order to prove that w is in the closure of [formula], it is enough to prove that 0 is in the closure of [formula], which follows from the next proposition.

The set [formula] is dense in [formula].

Consider the Legendre transform of Fm with respect to the second variable,

[formula]

It follows from this second expression that the function Gm is convex and finite-valued, hence continuous on [formula].

Consider the set [formula] of points (L,y) such that [formula], where ∂Gm is the subdifferential of Gm. It is known, see the appendix, that this set has Hausdorff dimension at most

[formula]

Consequently, the projection Σ of the set Σ̃ on the second factor [formula] also has Hausdorff dimension at most m - 1. Therefore, the complement of Σ is dense in [formula]. So it is enough to prove that

[formula]

Since we know by definition of Σ that [formula], it is enough to observe that

[formula]

The last inequality follows from the fact that the set Mm(L,y) is the subdifferential of the convex function

[formula]

at the point y.

Application to Lagrangian dynamics

Let C be the set of continuous functions [formula] with linear growth, i.e.

[formula]

endowed with the norm [formula].

We apply Theorem [\ref=abstract] to the following setting:

F = C* is the vector space of continuous linear functionals [formula] provided with the weak-[formula] topology. Recall that

[formula]

[formula] provided with the C∞ topology.

G is the vector space of finite Borel signed measures on [formula], or equivalently the set of continuous linear forms on [formula], provided with the weak-[formula] topology.

The pairing [formula] is given by integration:

[formula]

The continuous linear map π:F  →  G is induced by the projection [formula].

The compact K  ⊂  G is the set of Borel probability measures on [formula], provided with the weak-[formula] topology. Observe that K is separated by E.

The compact Hn  ⊂  F is the set of holonomic probability measures which are supported on

[formula]

Holonomic probabilities are defined as follows: Given a C1 curve [formula] of period [formula] define the element [formula] of F by

[formula]

for each f∈C. Let

[formula]

The set H of holonomic probabilities is the closure of Γ in F. One can see that H is convex (cf. Mañé [\cite=Ma6]). The elements μ of H satisfy 〈1,μ〉 = 1 therefore we have π(H)  ⊂  K.

Note that each Tonelli Lagrangian L gives rise to an element of H*n.

Let [formula] be the set of minimizing measures for L and let [formula] be the union of their supports. Recalling that we have defined MHn(L) as the set of measures μ∈Hn which minimize the action [formula] on Hn, we have:

If L is a Tonelli lagrangian then there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Birkhoff theorem implies that [formula] (cf. Mañé [\cite=Ma6]). In [\cite=Mat5] Mather proves that [formula] is compact, therefore [formula] for some [formula].

In [\cite=Ma6] Mañé proves that minimizing measures are also all the minimizers of the action functional [formula] on the set of holonomic measures, therefore [formula] for some [formula].

In [\cite=Mat5] Mather proves that the restriction  [formula]  of the projection TM  →  M is injective. Therefore the linear map [formula] is injective, so that [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main].

Given [formula] apply Theorem [\ref=abstract] and obtain a residual subset On(A)  ⊂  E such that

[formula]

Let [formula]. By the Baire property O(A) is residual. We have that

[formula]

Then by Lemma [\ref=measures], [formula] for all L∈A and all u∈O(A).

Convex Functions

Given a convex function [formula] and [formula], define its subdifferential as

[formula]

Then the sets [formula] are convex. If [formula], let

[formula]

The following result is standard.

If [formula] is a convex function then for all [formula] the Hausdorff dimension [formula].

We recall here an elegant proof due to Ambrosio and Alberti, see [\cite=AA]. Note that much more can be said on the structure of Σk, see [\cite=alberti] [\cite=Z] for example.

By adding [formula] if necessary (which does not change Σk) we can assume that f is superlinear and that

[formula]

[formula],   [formula]  [formula]   [formula].

From inequality [\eqref=ellineq] we have that

[formula]

Then Therefore [formula].

Since f is superlinear, the subdifferential ∂f is surjective and we have:

There exists a Lipschitz function [formula] such that

[formula]

Proof of Proposition [\ref=cxprop]:

Let Ak be a set with HD(Ak) = n - k such that Ak intersects any convex subset of dimension k. For example

[formula]

Observe that

[formula]

Therefore Σk  ⊂  F(Ak). Since F is Lipschitz, we have that [formula].
