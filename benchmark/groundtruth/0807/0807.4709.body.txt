Bosonic Fields in Causal Set Theory

Introduction

In Refs [\cite=paper1] and [\cite=paper3], we found a way to define the Lagrangian for scalar and gauge fields on causal sets in a coordinate-independent way. This was achieved by considering an Alexandrov set based at points p and q, inside of which both fields are assumed to be linear. We found a way of estimating the Lagrangians of both of these fields by looking at the value of the scalar field at the endpoints of the Alexandrov set, as well as the integrals of the scalar field and the holonomies associated with the gauge field over the interior of that Alexandrov set. Due to the specifics of the shape of an Alexandrov set, none of those integrals by itself gave us a relativistically invariant expression; instead, each of the expressions singled out the axis of the Alexandrov set as a "prefered direction". However, for each field we were able to find linear combinations of two different integrals such that all of the non-covariant contributions to the Lagrangian canceled out. In each case, this result was obtained by a clever adjustment of the coefficients. Therefore, those papers leave one puzzled with an important question: how come the coefficients had to be so cleverly adjusted to restore relativity? Shouldn't a causal set be inherently relativistic? After all, its only fundamental property are the light cones, or the causal relations, so why does relativity have to be put in by hand, instead of being dictated by the very structure of the causal set?

The purpose of this paper is to redo the procedure followed in those other papers in a way that relativistic invariance is automatic and we no longer have to adjust the coefficients. This is done by selecting only one of the terms of those expressions, which by itself is non-invariant, and then searching for an Alexandrov set with the smallest possible variations of that particular term, under the constraint that the volume of the Alexandrov set be bounded below. Due to the fact that the procedure of selecting such an Alexandrov set is defined in a relativistically invariant way, one would expect the variations of the given term on that particular Alexandrov set to be represented by a relativistically covariant function, which I would expect to be a relativistic generalization of the given non-covariant term, and would give me the Lagrangian I am looking for. In this paper I will show how to follow this procedure for a scalar field and a gauge field, while work is still in progress for the case of the gravitational field; the greater difficulty encountered with the latter may be related to the fact that it is the only field with quadratic derivatives in the action.

One thing worth mentioning is that in the previous papers, after constructing a covariant expression based on one Alexandrov set we still had to select an Alexandrov set with minimal variations! In the cases of those papers, the purpose was different: We were concerned about the issue that in the vicinity of the light cone the field can fluctuate a lot, despite the fact that the Lorentzian distance is arbitrarily small. In Ref [\cite=paper1], it was pointed out that the real issue is not our inability to make the theory truly invariant, but rather the fact that since the velocity group in non-compact, if the velocities of different physical objects were truly random, most of them would be outside of any given range of velocities, which implies that similar disturbances would happen in all frames. This is something that would be true in both the relativistic and the Newtonian pictures. In the Newtonian case it would mean that most velocities would be arbitrarily large, while relativistically it would mean that most of them would be arbitrarily close to the light cone. In either case, any kind of continuity of the field would be completely disrupted in all frames. �Thus, in order to be able to assume the linearity of the fields of interest, we had to informally postulate the existence of a "nice" Alexandrov set where things work. While no formal postulate to this effect was made, this idea was taken into account by the fact that when evaluating the Lagrangian at any given point, we looked for the Alexandrov set in which the Lagrangian density fluctuated the least. Thus, in the special case where the Lagrangian is indeed smooth, this would imply the selection of the "smooth" Alexandrov set. While it is still subject to numerical verification, it was hoped that all the non-smooth cases would cancel out by interference in a similar fashion as it happens in path integration of ordinary QFT, where we can assume a smooth behavior in approximating derivatives despite the fact that we are integrating over all fields, including non-smooth ones.

However, while in the previous papers the sole purpose of the procedure was to address the variation issue arising as a result of the non-compact momentum range, this paper shows that this same procedure happens to have an amazing feature: the restoration of relativity. Thus, it will be shown that even in the cases where the fields are assumed to be linear, which means that variations are no longer an issue, the same minimization procedure is still useful in order to make the Lagrangian relativistically invariant without resorting to the adjustment of coefficients in linear combinations of more than one term. The fact that these two, seemingly unrelated, issues are being addressed by the same mechanism, makes the mechanism look a lot more natural, which means that the proposed answer to both problems is a lot more satisfactory. Besides, all the expressions for the Lagrangian become a lot simpler, as they no longer involve integration, which means they are much easier candidates for the numerical studies on the causal sets.

Scalar Field

Suppose we have a field φ and we would like to find an Alexandrov set that minimizes the maximum variation of φ between two points inside it. We will consider two cases, depending on whether the gradient of φ is timelike or spacelike.

CASE 1: The gradient of φ is timelike, ∂μφ  ∂μφ  >  0.

In this case, we can choose a coordinate system in which the gradient of φ points in the t direction, while the remaining coordinates xk vary along spacelike directions normal to ∂μφ. That is, ∂kφ = 0. If r and s are elements of the Alexandrov set α(p,q) then |r0  -  s0|  ≤  q0  -  p0, thus |φ(r) - φ(s)|  ≤  |φ(q) - φ(p)|. Thus, the maximal variation of the scalar field inside the Alexandrov set α(p,q) is given by |φ(q)  -  φ(p)|. But due to the assumption that the gradient of φ points in the t direction, the latter is proportional to q0  -  p0. Thus, in order to minimize the variation of φ inside the Alexandrov set α(p,q), I have to minimize q0  -  p0. If I were to impose the constraint of τ(p,q)  ≥  τ0, in order to do the above minimization I have to say pk  -  qk = 0, or in other words the direction of the line passing through p and q should coincide with the direction of the gradient of φ. Thus, we have

[formula]

It would have been simpler if, instead of selecting r and s, I were to simply use p and q, since I know ahead of time that the maximization criterion will select r = p and s = q. However, I choose to leave the above expression in that form, since the simplification would not work in the case of a spacelike gradient of φ and I prefer if expressions for timelike and spacelike cases are the same.

From Ref [\cite=paper1], we know that in dimension d the volume of an Alexandrov set is

[formula]

Thus, we can rewrite the above expression as

[formula]

and its covarient generalization is

[formula]

CASE 2: The gradient of φ is spacelike, ∂μφ  ∂μφ  <  0.

In this case, start by selecting a frame in which the gradient of φ points along the x axis. Then, given any Alexandrov set α(p,q) we can select a frame in which p and q lie in the t-x plane. By considering the cases px  <  0  <  qx and qx  <  0  <  px, in both of which pμ  =   - qμ, it is easy to see that the two intersections of the Alexandrov set with the x axis lie on - qt  -  |qx| and qt  +  |qx|. Since the gradient of φ points in the x direction, in order to minimize the variation of φ we have to minimize qt  +  |qx|. But qt is bounded below since the volume of the Alexandrov sets we consider is bounded below. Thus, we have to miminize |qx|. This means that we have to set qx  =  0. Since I assumed that q lies in the t-x plane, this means q  =  (q0,0,0,0) and since pμ  =   - qμ we have p  =  ( - q0,0,0,0). The intersections of the Alexandrov set with the x axis are at [formula] and [formula]. Thus, the maximal variation of φ is [formula]. This will give us ∂μφ  ∂μφ  =    -  (∂1φ)2  =   - (Var(φ))2  /  τ2(p,q) (where Varφ stands for "variation of φ ) which happens to be the same answer as for the case where the gradient of φ is timelike, except for the negative sign.

Now, in order to determine whether or not we need a minus sign, all we have to do is this: in the case where the gradient of φ is timelike, points p and q correspond to the largest possible variation of φ. On the other hand, in the case where the gradient of φ is spacelike, the variation of φ between p and q is 0. Now of course in real life neither of these two things will be exact, due to things like discretization as well as curvature. But since these two numbers are very far apart, they are easily distinguishable if we come up with some precision ε.

Gauge Field

In this section, we will restrict ourselves to d = 4. We will first find a way to write down lagrangian specifically for the electromagnetic field, and then we will generalize our answer on all gauge fields.

Again, we are going to rotate frames to the ones that would correspond to maximal and minimal variations of the two fields. We would first like to mix the electric and magnetic fields in such a way that they take the simplest possible form. We know that electric and magnetic fields mix under boosts, as opposed to rotations. There are six degrees of freedom associated with the Lorentz group. Since the electric field does not change under boosts in the direction of the magnetic field, nor does the magnetic field change under boosts in the direction of the electric field, the total number of degrees of freedom is 6 - 2  =  4. At the same time, there are six degrees of freedom corresponding to Fμν and there are two invariants, E2  -  B2  =  Fμν  Fμν and [formula]. This again leaves us with 6  -  2  =  4 degrees of freedom. Thus, Lorentz boosts can do anything to E and B as long as the above two invariants are respected. In particular, this means that we can make a boost in such a way that E becomes parallel to B. After that, we can rotate the coordinates in such a way that both point in the z direction.

We will borrow the approach of Ref [\cite=paper3], in that we will try to use products of holonomies in order to compute the flux of the electromagnetic field through closed loops, and then use those results to deduce all the necessary information needed to compute the Lagrangian density of the field. However, there is one difference: in Ref [\cite=paper3] triangular loops were used, as evidenced by the fact that we were looking at expressions of the form a(r1,r2)  a(r2,r3)  a(r3,r1), which are threefold products of holonomies defined by pairs of points, in our calculations. In the present situation we will use rectangles instead, and thus we will use fourfold products a(r1,r2)  a(r2,r3)  a(r3,r4)  a(r4,r1) instead. This decision is based on the fact that the equator of an Alexandroff set is spherically shaped, while its intersection with, say, the x-t plane is not, and the maximal area of the triangles lying in the intersection of the Alexandroff set with the x-y plane is not the same as the maximal area we will get from its intersection with the x-t plane. On the other hand, if we take rectangles, then as we will shortly see, in both cases the area is maximized by a square each of whose vertices has as one of the coordinates either [formula] or [formula], while all other coordinates vanish. One might first ask the following question: if a causal set is inherently relativistic, doesn't it mean that we will get a covariant answer no matter what shape of the contour we choose, as long as our procedure is covariant? The answer is yes, but we have to be more careful as to what we mean by relativistically invariant. Strictly speaking, relativistically invariant means it doesn't change under rotations and boosts. Now, there is no rotation or boost that would take a spacelike vector into a timelike vector, or viceversa. Thus, we can claim that we have two different answers for the spacelike and timelike contours, without violating relativistic invariance. However, despite the fact that this would be an invariant answer, it is not an anser we happened to like. So, in order to get an answer we like better, we chose to use rectangles instead of triangles.

It is easy to see that if we were to select the axis of the Alexandrov set to be parallel to the t axis in the above frame, then this would minimize the variation of a(p,r)  a(r,q)  a(q,s)  a(s,p). After all, to either maximize or minimize the flux of the electric field through the square, we have to maximize or minimize the projection of the area of that square on the t-z plane. We note that the area of the above projection is invariant with respect to boosts in the t-z plane. Therefore, we might as well pick a square whose timelike axis does not have a z component. In this case, it is easy to see that in order to minimize the area of the projection on the t-z plane of such a square, with a constraint of constant length of its timelike axis, we have to make sure that the x and y components of the latter are both 0. Now, if we choose the Alexandrov set in this way, then the maximum of a(p,r)  a(r,q)  a(q,s)  a(s,p) occurs for the case where r1 and r3 lie on the intersection of the z axis with the boundary of the Alexandrov set: [formula] and [formula]. This maximum is given by

[formula]

which means that

[formula]

which is not the desired result. We thus have to do two things:

(1) Check that the result that we got is still relativistically invariant, albeit unwanted one. This will verify that there were no conceptual mistakes, since, unless something was missed, the construction was invariant.

(2) Find some additional terms to get rid of the unwanted ones. As you will see, even though we will still have an additional term, there won't be any cleverly adjusted coefficients.

Part I

In the reference frame in which E is parallel to B, we can treat them as scalars and have the following system of equations

[formula]

This gives us a system of two equations and two unknowns, which means that if we solve it for E2 and B2, we will get a covariant expression for each of these terms separately. This should not surprise us. After all, when we decided to treat E and B as scalars, we were assuming that we are in a special frame where E and B are parallel. Thus, the procedure of first finding such frame and then evaluating E and B in that frame is covariant, despite the fact that E and B in an arbitrary frame are not.

Now, to satisfy ourselves, let us solve that system of equations to get an expression for E and B. The second equation implies that B  =  εαβγδ  Fαβ  Fγδ / kE. Substituting this into the first equation, we get

[formula]

Multiplying it by E2, and moving all terms to the left-hand side, we get the following equation

[formula]

This solves to

[formula]

Thus, first equation of the system of two equations gives us

[formula]

As we see, these are definitely covariant expressions. The reason we are not getting the answer we would like is that there is more than one covariant contraction: Fμν  Fμν and εαβγδ  Fαβ  Fγδ. We would like to only have the former and get rid of the latter. That is what we will do in part II.

Part II

The way we will get a covariant expression is by computing B and then calculating E2  -  B2 by hand. We will do that by looking at the variation of a(r1,r2)  a(r2,r3)  a(r3,r4)  a(r4,r1), where [formula] and ri is always spacelike related to rj for any i  ≠  j.

We would like to maximize the area of the rectangle based at points r1, r2, r3 and r4, all lying on the intersection of the x-y plane with the boundary of the Alexandrov set. The area of this rectangle can be computed as follows: we connect each of these 4 points to the origin. This would break the picture into 4 triangles. The angles of the two adjacent lines of the triangle that meet at the origin are θ1, θ2, θ3 and θ4. �Each triangle can be further broken into two triangles by drawing the perpendicular line from the origin to the line connecting the opposite side of that triangle. The area of each of the two pieces is

[formula]

Thus, the area of the whole thing is

[formula]

Thus we would like to maximize [formula], with the constraint that [formula].

This means that the gradient of [formula] should be parallel to the gradient of [formula]. In other words, there is constant c such that

[formula]

This implies that

[formula]

In other words, all angles are equal. Since their sum is 2π this means that they are all equal to [formula]. So this can be accomplished by putting r1 and r3 at the intersections of the x axis with the boundaries of the Alexandrov set, and r2 and r4 at the intersections of the y axis with the boundaries of the Alexandrov set.

By a similar argument as for the electric field, the variation of the magnetic field is minimized if we let r1 and r3 be at the intersection of the x axis with the boundary of the Alexandrov set, while r2 and r4 are at the intersection of the y axis with the boundary of the Alexandrov set:

[formula]

The area of the square will be the same as in the t-z case, hence we will get�

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

This means that the Lagrangian is given by

[formula]

Now lets generalize the above equation for the electromagnetic field to other gauge fields. As we recall, in the standard scenario this amounts to adding extra index: FμνFμν we are familiar with in electromagnetism generalizes to FkμνFkμν. Thus, in our case, we can add a gauge index to our holonomies, so Lagrangian becomes

[formula]

Interaction of charged scalar multiplet with gauge field

Now we will consider an interaction of scalar field and gauge field.

First, we have to modify the expression for the scalar Lagrangian by introducing phase factors in order to account for the interaction with gauge field:

φi(r)  →  (eiak(p,r)Tk)ijφj(r)

Thus, the expression for spin 0 Lagrangian becomes

[formula]

Thus, the total Lagrangian is

[formula]

Conclusions

As we have seen in this paper, it is possible to express the Lagrangian for scalar and gauge fields by analyzing the minima and maxima of variations of the corresponding fields or holonomies, as a replacement for the integration done in previous papers. This has various advantages:

(1) Conceptual: This approach shows that relativity is, indeed, inherent to causal sets and arises naturally.

(2) Computational: Given the limitations of computer capacity, the fact that there are no integrations involved anymore in computing the Lagrangian density makes it a lot easier to plug it into the computer and calculate it using numerical methods.

There are, however, some open questions. In particular:

(1) While we no longer have to adjust the coefficients in a clever way, we still have to be careful, in the electromagnetic case, to avoid unwanted an relation with εαβγδFαβ  Fγδ. Although the good news are that: (a) This relation is relativistically invariant, hence it doesn't negate the intrinsic relativity of causal sets; (b) We can get rid of it by an extra term that does not involve a clever coefficient.

(2) The problem of representing the Lagrangian for the gravitational field by this method is still not solved.
