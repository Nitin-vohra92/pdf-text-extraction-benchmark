Mock Tridiagonal Systems

Tridiagonal systems and mock tridiagonal systems

The concept of a tridiagonal system was introduced in [\cite=TD00] as a natural generalization of a Leonard system [\cite=LS99] [\cite=qrac] [\cite=madrid] and as a tool for studying (P and Q)-polynomial association schemes [\cite=BanIto] [\cite=Cau] [\cite=pasc] [\cite=TersubI]. One can view the concept as part of the bispectral problem [\cite=GH7] [\cite=GH1] [\cite=Zhidd]. There are connections to representation theory [\cite=hasan2] [\cite=neubauer] [\cite=Ha] [\cite=tdanduq] [\cite=NN] [\cite=IT:aug] [\cite=qtet] [\cite=Ev] [\cite=IT:Krawt] [\cite=qracah] [\cite=qSerre] and statistical mechanical models [\cite=bas1] [\cite=bas2] [\cite=bas6] [\cite=bas7] [\cite=DateRoan2] [\cite=Davfirst] [\cite=Da] [\cite=Klish1]. More results on tridiagonal systems can be found in [\cite=TD00] [\cite=shape] [\cite=nom4] [\cite=N:aw] [\cite=N:refine] [\cite=nomsplit] [\cite=nomsharp] [\cite=nomtowards] [\cite=nomstructure] [\cite=nom:mu] [\cite=drin]. It remains an open problem to classify the tridiagonal systems up to isomorphism, but classifications do exist for some special cases [\cite=IT:Krawt] [\cite=IT:aug] [\cite=NN] [\cite=Vidar] [\cite=nom:mu] [\cite=qracah]. To make further progress on the classification problem, in this paper we introduce the notion of a mock tridiagonal system. This is a generalization of a tridiagonal system in which the irreducibility assumption is replaced by a certain nonvanishing condition. In our main result, we show how mock tridiagonal systems can be used to construct tridiagonal systems that meet certain specifications.

Before going into more detail we recall the definition of a tridiagonal system. We will use the following terms. Throughout this paper [formula] denotes a field, and V denotes a vector space over [formula] with finite positive dimension. Let End(V) denote the [formula]-algebra of all [formula]-linear transformations from V to V. Given A∈End(V) and a subspace W  ⊆  V, we call W an eigenspace of A whenever [formula] and there exists [formula] such that W = {v∈V  |  Av  =  θv}; in this case θ is the eigenvalue of A associated with W. We say that A is diagonalizable whenever V is spanned by the eigenspaces of A. Assume A is diagonalizable. Let {Vi}di = 0 denote an ordering of the eigenspaces of A and let {θi}di = 0 denote the corresponding ordering of the eigenvalues of A. For 0  ≤  i  ≤  d define Ei∈(V) such that (Ei - I)Vi = 0 and EiVj = 0 for j  ≠  i (0  ≤  j  ≤  d). Here I denotes the identity of (V). We call Ei the primitive idempotent of A corresponding to Vi (or θi). Observe that (i) [formula]; (ii) EiEj  =  δi,jEi (0  ≤  i,j  ≤  d); (iii) Vi = EiV (0  ≤  i  ≤  d); (iv) [formula]. Moreover

[formula]

Note that each of {Ai}di = 0, {Ei}di = 0 is a basis for the [formula]-subalgebra of (V) generated by A. Moreover [formula].

[\cite=TD00] By a tridiagonal system (or TD system) on V we mean a sequence Φ = (A;{Ei}di = 0;A*;{E*i}δi = 0) that satisfies (i)-(iv) below.

Each of A,A* is a diagonalizable element of (V).

{Ei}di = 0 is an ordering of the primitive idempotents of A such that

[formula]

{E*i}δi = 0 is an ordering of the primitive idempotents of A* such that

[formula]

There does not exist a subspace W of V such that AW  ⊆  W, A*W  ⊆  W, [formula], [formula].

We say that Φ is over [formula].

According to a common notational convention X* denotes the conjugate-transpose of X. We are not using this convention. For the TD system in Definition [\ref=def:tds] the linear transformations A, Ei, A*, E*i are arbitrary subject to (i)-(iv) above.

Referring to the TD system Φ in Definition [\ref=def:tds], it turns out that the integers d and δ are equal [\cite=TD00]; we call this common value the diameter of Φ.

In the theory of TD systems the following situation often occurs: we wish to show that there exists a TD system that meets some given specifications [\cite=nom:mu] [\cite=qracah]. Suppose we have a candidate (A;{Ei}di = 0;A*;{E*i}di = 0), and we just want to check that it really is a TD system. It is usually routine to verify conditions (i)-(iii) of Definition [\ref=def:tds], but often difficult to verify condition (iv) of Definition [\ref=def:tds]. In this paper we give a method for constructing TD systems that overcomes this difficulty. The method is based on the notion of a mock tridiagonal system which we now introduce.

By a mock tridiagonal system (or MTD system) on V we mean a sequence Φ = (A;{Ei}di = 0;A*;{E*i}di = 0) that satisfies (i)-(iv) below.

Each of A,A* is a diagonalizable element of (V).

{Ei}di = 0 is an ordering of the primitive idempotents of A such that

[formula]

{E*i}di = 0 is an ordering of the primitive idempotents of A* such that

[formula]

Each of E*0E0E*0, E*0EdE*0 is nonzero.

We say that Φ is over [formula].

Any TD system on V is an MTD system on V.

Proof: Let (A;{Ei}di = 0;A*; {E*i}di = 0) denote the TD system in question. We show that each of E*0E0E*0, E*0EdE*0 is nonzero. By [\cite=nomsharp] the map E*0V  →  E0V, u  ↦  E0u is bijective and the map E0V  →  E*0V, v  ↦  E*0v is bijective. By construction E*0 acts as the identity on E*0V. Therefore the restriction of E*0E0E*0 to E*0V gives a bijection E*0V  →  E*0V. The space E*0V is nonzero so E*0E0E*0 is nonzero. One similarly finds that E*0EdE*0 is nonzero. [formula]

In Section 4 we display some MTD systems that are not TD systems.

Statement of the main theorem

In this section we state our main results. In order to do this concisely we first discuss some basic concepts.

Let Φ = (A;{Ei}di = 0;A*; {E*i}di = 0) denote an MTD system on V. For 0  ≤  i  ≤  d let θi (resp. θ*i) denote the eigenvalue of A (resp. A*) associated with the eigenspace EiV (resp. E*iV). We call {θi}di = 0 (resp. {θ*i}di = 0) the eigenvalue sequence (resp. dual eigenvalue sequence) of Φ. Observe that {θi}di = 0 (resp. {θ*i}di = 0) are mutually distinct and contained in [formula].

Referring to Definition [\ref=def], we call Φ sharp whenever E*0V has dimension 1 [\cite=nomsharp]. By [\cite=nomstructure], every TD system over an algebraically closed field is sharp.

The following notation will be useful.

Let λ denote an indeterminate and let [formula] denote the [formula]-algebra consisting of the polynomials in λ that have all coefficients in [formula]. Let {θi}di = 0 and {θ*i}di = 0 denote scalars in [formula]. For 0  ≤  i  ≤  d we define the following polynomials in [formula]:

[formula]

Note that each of τi, ηi, τ*i, η*i is monic with degree i.

Let (A;{Ei}di = 0;A*;{E*i}di = 0) denote a sharp MTD system on V, with eigenvalue sequence {θi}di = 0 and dual eigenvalue sequence {θ*i}di = 0. Then for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d there exists a unique [formula] such that

[formula]

Proof: The given MTD system is sharp so E*0V has dimension 1. Therefore E*0 has rank 1 and this implies [formula], where A  =  End(V). The result follows. [formula]

Let Φ denote a sharp MTD system. By the split sequence of Φ we mean the sequence {ζi}di = 0 from Lemma [\ref=lem:split]. Observe that ζ0 = 1.

Let Φ denote a sharp MTD system. By the parameter array of Φ we mean the sequence ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0;{ζi}di = 0) where {θi}di = 0 (resp. {θ*i}di = 0) is the eigenvalue sequence (resp. dual eigenvalue sequence) of Φ and {ζi}di = 0 is the split sequence of Φ.

The following proposition indicates the importance of the parameter array. The proposition refers to the notion of isomorphism for TD systems, which is defined in [\cite=nomsharp].

[\cite=nomstructure] Two sharp TD systems over [formula] are isomorphic if and only if they have the same parameter array.

We now state our main result.

Let Φ denote a sharp MTD system over [formula]. Then there exists a sharp TD system over [formula] that has the same parameter array as Φ.

We will use the following strategy to prove Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. Let Φ = (A;{Ei}di = 0;A*;{E*i}di = 0) denote a sharp MTD system on V, with parameter array ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0;{ζi}di = 0). Let T denote the [formula]-subalgebra of End(V) generated by A,A*, and consider the T-module TE*0V. We show that TE*0V contains a unique maximal proper T-submodule. Denote this submodule by M and consider the quotient T-module L = TE*0V / M. By construction the T-module L is nonzero and irreducible. We show that the sequence (A;{Ei}di = 0;A*;{E*i}di = 0) acts on L as a sharp TD system with parameter array ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0;{ζi}di = 0).

The proof of the main theorem

In this section we give a proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. Throughout this section we fix a sharp MTD system (A;{Ei}di = 0;A*;{E*i}di = 0) on V.

Let T denote the [formula]-subalgebra of End(V) generated by A,A*. By definition T contains the identity I of End(V). By ([\ref=eq:defEi]) the algebra T contains each of Ei,E*i for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d.

We now consider the T-module TE*0V. We will be discussing proper T-submodules of TE*0V. The word proper means that the T-submodule in question is properly contained in TE*0V, or in other words not equal to TE*0V.

Let W denote a proper T-submodule of TE*0V. Then W is called maximal whenever W is not contained in any proper T-submodule of TE*0V, besides itself.

Our first goal is to show that TE*0V has a unique maximal proper T-submodule.

Let W denote a proper T-submodule of TE*0V. Then E*0W = 0.

Proof: Suppose [formula]. The space E*0V contains E*0W and has dimension 1, so E*0V = E*0W. The space W is T-invariant and E*0∈T so E*0W  ⊆  W. Therefore E*0V  ⊆  W, which yields TE*0V  ⊆  W. This contradicts the fact that W is properly contained in TE*0V. Therefore E*0W = 0. [formula]

Let W and W' denote proper T-submodules of TE*0V. Then W + W' is a proper T-submodule of TE*0V.

Proof: We show [formula]. Define K = {u∈TE*0V  |  E*0u = 0}. Then [formula], since [formula] and E*0 acts as the identity on E*0V. The space K contains each of W,W' by Lemma [\ref=lem:110], so K contains W + W'. Therefore [formula] and the result follows. [formula]

There exists a unique maximal proper T-submodule of TE*0V.

Proof: Concerning existence, let W denote the subspace of TE*0V spanned by all the proper T-submodules of TE*0V. Then W is a proper T-submodule of TE*0V by Lemma [\ref=lem:ww], and since TE*0V has finite dimension. The T-submodule W is maximal by the construction. Concerning uniqueness, suppose W and W' are maximal proper T-submodules of TE*0V. By Lemma [\ref=lem:ww] W + W' is a proper T-submodule of TE*0V. The space W + W' contains each of W, W' so W + W' is equal to each of W, W' by the maximality of W and W'. Therefore W = W' and the result follows. [formula]

Let M denote the maximal proper T-submodule of TE*0V. Let L denote the quotient T-module [formula]. By construction the T-module L is nonzero and irreducible.

The sequence (A;{Ei}di = 0;A*;{E*i}di = 0) acts on L as a TD system with parameter array ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0;{ζi}di = 0).

Proof: The following equations hold in T and hence on L:

[formula]

Define [formula] and [formula]. By the equations on the left in ([\ref=eq:eprod]), ([\ref=eq:esum]) we have [formula] (direct sum). Using the equations on the left in ([\ref=eq:eprod]), ([\ref=eq:asum]) we find that for i∈S the space EiL is an eigenspace for A with eigenvalue θi. By these comments A is diagonalizable on L with eigenvalues {θi}i∈S. By the equation on the left in ([\ref=eq:eprod]), for i∈S the element Ei acts as the identity on EiL and vanishes on EjL for [formula] (j∈S). In other words Ei acts on L as the primitive idempotent of A associated with θi. Similarly A* is diagonalizable on L with eigenvalues {θ*i}i∈S*, and for i∈S* the element E*i acts on L as the primitive idempotent of A* associated with θ*i. We now show that there exist nonnegative integers r,k (r  +  k  ≤  d) such that [formula]. The set S is nonempty since L is nonzero and equal to [formula]. Define r  =   min{i  |  i∈S} and p  =   max{i  |  i∈S}. For r + 1  ≤  i  ≤  p - 1 we have i∈S; otherwise [formula] is a nonzero proper T-submodule of L, contradicting the irreducibility of the T-module L. Now [formula] where k = p - r. Similarly there exist nonnegative integers t,k* (t  +  k*  ≤  d) such that [formula]. By the argument so far, the sequence (A;{Ei}r + ki = r;A*;{E*i}t + k*i = t) acts on L as a TD system. For this system we invoke the first sentence of Definition [\ref=def:diam] to get k  =  k*. We now show that r = 0. Suppose [formula]. Then [formula] so E0L = 0. This implies E0TE*0V  ⊆  M so E0E*0V  ⊆  M. In this containment we apply E*0 to both sides and use E*0M = 0 to get E*0E0E*0V = 0. This contradicts Definition [\ref=def:mtds](iv) so r = 0. Next we show that t = 0. Suppose [formula]. Then [formula] so E*0L = 0. This implies E*0TE*0V  ⊆  M so E*0V  ⊆  M. But then TE*0V  ⊆  M since M is T-invariant. This contradicts the fact that M is properly contained in TE*0V, so t = 0. We now show that k = d. Suppose [formula]. Then [formula] so EdL = 0. This implies EdTE*0V  ⊆  M so EdE*0V  ⊆  M. In this containment we apply E*0 to both sides and use E*0M = 0 to get E*0EdE*0V = 0. This contradicts Definition [\ref=def:mtds](iv) so k  =  d. We have shown (r,t,k) = (0,0,d), so now (A;{Ei}di = 0;A*;{E*i}di = 0) acts on L as a TD system which we denote by Φ. By construction Φ has eigenvalue sequence {θi}di = 0 and dual eigenvalue sequence {θ*i}di = 0. By Lemma [\ref=lem:split] and Definition [\ref=def:split] the equations

[formula]

hold on V. Therefore these equations hold in T and hence on L. By this and Definition [\ref=def:split] the sequence {ζi}di = 0 is the split sequence for Φ. By these comments Φ has parameter array ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0;{ζi}di = 0) and the result follows. [formula]

Theorem [\ref=thm:main] is immediate from Proposition [\ref=thm:exist].

We finish this section with two corollaries of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] and Proposition [\ref=thm:exist]. The first corollary is about the dimensions of the [formula]-vector spaces L and M from Definition [\ref=def:m].

The following (i), (ii) hold.

dim(L)  ≥  d + 1;

dim(M)  ≤   dim(TE*0V) - d - 1.

Proof: (i) By Proposition [\ref=thm:exist] there exists a TD system on L that has diameter d. (ii) Recall that L is the quotient TE*0V / M so  dim(L) +  dim(M) =  dim(TE*0V). The result follows from this and (i) above. [formula]

In the next corollary we list some constraints satisfied by the parameter array of a sharp MTD system.

Let ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0;{ζi}di = 0) denote the parameter array of a sharp MTD system. Then (i)- (iii) hold below:

θi  ≠  θj, θ*i  ≠  θ*j if i  ≠  j (0  ≤  i,j  ≤  d).

ζ0 = 1, ζd  ≠  0, and

The expressions are equal and independent of i for 2  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1.

Proof: Let Φ denote the sharp MTD system in question. Then Φ satisfies condition (i) by the last sentence of Definition [\ref=def]. Φ satisfies condition (ii) by Theorem [\ref=thm:main] and since (ii) holds for any sharp TD system with parameter array ({θi}di = 0;{θ*i}di = 0;{ζi}di = 0) [\cite=nomsharp]. Φ satisfies condition (iii) by Theorem [\ref=thm:main] and since (iii) holds for any TD system with eigenvalue sequence {θi}di = 0 and dual eigenvalue sequence {θ*i}di = 0 [\cite=TD00]. [formula]

An example

In this section we consider a family of sharp MTD systems over [formula] that have diameter 2. In [\cite=Vidar] Vidar described the members of this family that are TD systems. Our focus here is on the family members that are not TD systems. For these members we find the space TE*0V from below Definition [\ref=def:talgebra], and the space M from Definition [\ref=def:m]. We also describe the induced TD system on L = TE*0V / M, from Proposition [\ref=thm:exist]. Throughout this section we make use of the work of Vidar [\cite=Vidar].

From now on we fix a sequence

[formula]

of scalars in [formula] that satisfy (i), (ii) below.

θi  ≠  θj, θ*i  ≠  θ*j if i  ≠  j (0  ≤  i,j  ≤  2).

ζ0 = 1, ζ2  ≠  0, and

[formula]

Our first goal is to display an MTD system over [formula] that has parameter array ([\ref=eq:padiam2]).

Let V denote the vector space [formula] (column vectors). Define

[formula]

where

[formula]

We view A,A*∈End(V).

The matrix A (resp. A*) is diagonalizable with eigenvalues {θi}2i = 0 (resp. {θ*i}2i = 0). For 0  ≤  i  ≤  2 the dimension of the eigenspace for A (resp. A*) associated with θi (resp. θ*i) is [formula].

Proof: One checks that A has characteristic polynomial (λ  -  θ0)(λ  -  θ1)2(λ  -  θ2) and minimal polynomial (λ  -  θ0)(λ  -  θ1)(λ  -  θ2). Our assertions for A follow from this. Our assertions for A* are similary proved. [formula]

For 0  ≤  i  ≤  2 let Ei (resp. E*i) denote the primitive idempotent of A (resp. A*) associated with θi (resp. θ*i).

We have

[formula]

Proof: The matrices {Ei}2i = 0 are obtained using ([\ref=eq:defEi]). One similarly obtains {E*i}2i = 0. [formula]

The following (i)- (iii) hold.

E0A*E2  =  0, E2A*E0 = 0;

E*0AE*2  =  0, E*2AE*0 = 0;

[formula], [formula].

Proof: (i), (ii) Routine calculation using the matrices in Definition [\ref=def:vaas] and Lemma [\ref=lem:edata]. (iii) The (1,1)-entry of E*0E0E*0 is (θ0  -  θ1)- 1(θ0  -  θ2)- 1(θ*0  -  θ*1)- 1(θ*0  -  θ*2)- 1 times the expression on the right in ([\ref=eq:ineqcd2]). This expression is nonzero so [formula]. The (1,1)-entry of E*0E2E*0 is (θ2  -  θ0)- 1(θ2  -  θ1)- 1(θ*0  -  θ*1)- 1(θ*0  -  θ*2)- 1 times ζ2. By assumption [formula] so [formula]. [formula]

The sequence (A;{Ei}2i = 0;A*;{E*i}2i = 0) is an MTD system on V with parameter array ({θi}2i = 0;{θ*i}2i = 0;{ζi}2i = 0).

Proof: Let Φ denote the sequence in question. To show that Φ is an MTD system on V, we verify the conditions (i)-(iv) of Definition [\ref=def:mtds]. Condition (i) holds by Lemma [\ref=lem:aasdiag]. Condition (ii) holds by Definition [\ref=def:primid] and Lemma [\ref=lem:znz](i). Condition (iii) holds by Definition [\ref=def:primid] and Lemma [\ref=lem:znz](ii). Condition (iv) holds by Lemma [\ref=lem:znz](iii). We have verified the conditions of Definition [\ref=def:mtds], so Φ is an MTD system on V. By Lemma [\ref=lem:aasdiag] and Definition [\ref=def:primid], Φ has eigenvalue sequence {θi}2i = 0 and dual eigenvalue sequence {θ*i}2i = 0. Using Lemma [\ref=lem:split] and Definition [\ref=def:split] we find that Φ has split sequence {ζi}2i = 0. By these comments Φ has parameter array ({θi}2i = 0;{θ*i}2i = 0;{ζi}2i = 0) and the result follows. [formula]

(Vidar [\cite=Vidar]) The following (i), (ii) are equivalent:

The MTD system from Proposition [\ref=prop:gotmtd] is a TD system;

[formula].

In Proposition [\ref=prop:gotmtd] we displayed an MTD system (A;{Ei}2i = 0;A*;{E*i}2i = 0). In what follows we consider the corresponding algebra T from Definition [\ref=def:talgebra], and the T-modules L,M from Definition [\ref=def:m].

Assume ζ1ζ×1  =  ζ2. Then the following (i), (ii) hold.

TE*0V = V.

The [formula]-vector space M is one-dimensional and spanned by (0, - ζ×1,1,0)t.

Proof: (i) The span of the vector (1,0,0,0)t is E*0V, the span of (0,0,0,1)t is E2V, the span of (0,1,0,0)t is (A - θ0I)E*0V, and the span of (0,0,1,0)t is (A*  -  θ*2I)E2V. Therefore

[formula]

By the form of A,

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=eq:vspan]), ([\ref=eq:e0e2]) we find TE*0V = V. (ii) Let W denote the subspace of V spanned by the vector (0, - ζ×1,1,0)t. Using Definition [\ref=def:vaas] one checks that (A - θ1I)W = 0 and (A*  -  θ*1I)W = 0. Therefore W is a T-submodule of V. Of course W is properly contained in V so W  ⊆  M. Consequently the dimension of M is at least one. The dimension of M is at most one by Corollary [\ref=cor:mdim](ii), so the dimension of M is one. The result follows. [formula]

Assume ζ1ζ×1  =  ζ2. By Lemma [\ref=lem:lm](ii) the [formula]-vector space L has a basis {vi}2i = 0 such that

[formula]

Assume ζ1ζ×1  =  ζ2. With respect to the basis {vi}2i = 0 from Definition [\ref=def:vibasis] the matrices repesenting A, A* are as follows.

[formula]

Proof: Routine using Definition [\ref=def:vaas] and Definition [\ref=def:vibasis]. [formula]

Assume ζ1ζ×1  =  ζ2. With respect to the basis {vi}2i = 0 from Definition [\ref=def:vibasis] the matrices repesenting {Ei}2i = 0 and {E*i}2i = 0 are as follows.

[formula]

Proof: Routine using Lemma [\ref=lem:edata] and Definition [\ref=def:vibasis]. [formula]
