Introduction

Let k be a field and let G be a finite group. It is well-known that a kG-module V, simply called a G-module, carries a non-degenerate G-invariant k-bilinear form if and only if V is isomorphic to its dual V*  =  Homk(V,k). Up to an automorphism of V, a simple self-dual G-module [formula] carries exactly one G-invariant bilinear form different from the zero. In case k is large enough, for instance k algebraically closed, this means that such a form, if it exists, is unique up to a scalar. If in addition the characteristic p of k is odd this form is symmetric or antisymmetric. The case p = 2 turns out to be more subtle. Note that in this case an antisymmetric form is symmetric. By Fong's Lemma ([\cite=Huppert], Chap. VII, Theorem 8.13), a simple self-dual G-module V different from the trivial module always carries a non-degenerate G-invariant symplectic form. However, it may happen that V even has a non-degenerate G-invariant quadratic form. This holds true, for instance, if G is solvable but not in general. What really happens is not an easy task to decide; it is a question in cohomology (see [\cite=Sin-Wi]), at least for arbitrary groups. To be brief throughout the paper we call a G-module of symmetric, antisymmetric, symplectic, resp. quadratic type if V carries a non-degenerate G-invariant form of symmetric, antisymmetric, symplectic, resp. quadratic type. The reader not familiar with duality theory of modules may refer Chapter VII of [\cite=Huppert].

In representation theory of finite groups G we are often interested in the category of modules belonging to a p-block BG of kG where the underlying field k is of characteristic p. Instead of investigating BG we may study a Morita equivalent p-block BH for some other group H. Recall that one calls two blocks Morita equivalent if their module categories are equivalent as exact categories. Morita theory shows that the module categories of the two blocks are equivalent if and only if there is an H  ×  G-bimodule M = HMG where M is a progenerator for BH and for BG. Moreover the functor

[formula]

defines an equivalence from the module category of BG onto that of BH. The correspondence preserves all functorial properties of module categories, in particular being simple, indecomposable, projective, Loewy structure and the like. For more details the reader is referred to Chapter 4 in [\cite=RMO].

In this note we study the behaviour of self-duality including the type of forms under Morita equivalence. Given a group Γ recall that a Γ-module T carries a non degenerate Γ-invariant bilinear form if and only if T is self-dual. A first step to our main result, useful in its own right, is the following.

Theorem A. Let BG and BH be blocks for G and H respectively. Suppose that the H  ×  G-bimodule M = HMG defines a Morita equivalence between BG and BH and suppose that M is self-dual. Then a BG-left module V is self-dual if and only if [formula] is a self-dual BH-left module.

We present now our main result for algebraically closed fields k of odd characteristic. Given a group Γ we call a self-dual kΓ-module T of symmetric type if T carries a non degenerate Γ-invariant symmetric bilinear form. If T is simple and self-dual the Γ-invariant form is unique up to a scalar and the form is then either symmetric or antisymmetric. We call this the type of the simple module T.

Theorem B. Let k be an algebraically closed field of odd characteristic. Let M be an H  ×  G-bimodule inducing a Morita equivalence between a kG-block BG and a kH-block BH. If M is of symmetric type then the equivalence preserves the type of simple self-dual modules.

The main result for fields of characteristic 2 is weaker. We call a kΓ-module T of quadratic type if T admits a Γ-invariant non degenerate quadratic form.

Theorem C. Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2. Let M be an H  ×  G-bimodule inducing a Morita equivalence between a kG-block BG and a kH-block BH. If M is of symmetric type then the equivalence preserves the property "being of quadratic type" on projective modules.

Theorem A, Theorem B and Theorem C give invariants under Morita equivalence in case the Morita bimodule which induces the equivalence is self-dual for Theorem A, or even more of symmetric type for Theorem B and Theorem C. Moreover, we show that this is actually a property of the module categories, rather than of the particular bimodule. Indeed Remark [\ref=remarkpicgroup] shows that if M is a self-dual Morita bimodule inducing an equivalence between two blocks of group algebras, then any Morita bimodule between these blocks is self-dual. If the Morita bimodule is moreover of symmetric type, then every Morita bimodule between these blocks is self-dual.

Conditions on the Morita equivalence are actually necessary. The assertions of the theorems are false if we do not require suitable conditions on the Morita module. If the two blocks BG and BH of the group G and the group H are Morita equivalent, it happens that every simple module over BG is self-dual whereas no simple module over BH is self-dual. In particular, no self-dual Morita bimodule exists in this case. An example is given by a non principal 7-block of the triple cover of the McLaughlin group and the principal 7-block of the Mathieu group M23. For details see Example [\ref=Example2] below. Even worse, two Morita equivalent blocks BG and BH may admit a self-dual Morita bimodule, but the types of the forms on the simple modules of BG and of BH are different. Hence it may happen that no Morita bimodule can be of symmetric type. An example is given by a non principal 3-block of SL2(5) and the principal 3-block of [formula]. Details are found in Example [\ref=Example1] below.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section [\ref=Examplesection] the above-cited examples are developed in detail. Section [\ref=selfdualbimodule] is the technical heart of the paper since there Proposition [\ref=selfdualMorita] is shown: Given a self-dual, right-projective H  ×  G-bimodule M and a self-dual G module V, Proposition [\ref=selfdualMorita] gives an explicit isomorphism between the H-module [formula] and its dual. The proposition applies as well for stable equivalences of Morita type. Except unicity, most of what follows is valid in this more general setting. Moreover, Theorem A is proven there. Section [\ref=oddmorita] then proves Theorem B and Section [\ref=evenmorita] proves Theorem C.

Examples

In this section we show that Morita equivalence does not need to preserve self-duality of simple modules. In case it does, examples show that the geometric type of simple modules may vary via the correspondence.

In order to state the examples we need that blocks are determined by their Brauer trees up to Morita equivalence. Kupisch determined the structure of indecomposable modules of a Brauer tree algebra, and hence he implicitly determined their module category, i.e., the Morita equivalence class of a Brauer tree algebra. In modern terms Kupisch's result reads as follows.

In the following examples we shall use Brauer trees computed by Hiss and Lux in [\cite=HissLux]. The geometric type of simple self-dual modules, i.e. symmetric or alternating, is taken from [\cite=Conway] or [\cite=Jansen].

As a consequence, the type of bilinear forms is usually not preserved by Morita equivalence, even if self-duality is preserved on simple modules.

As a consequence every Morita bimodule inducing a Morita equivalence between B3(M23) and B2(3McL) has the property that each self-dual simple B3(M23)-module is sent to a simple B2(3McL)-module which is not self-dual.

Self-dual Morita bimodules

Let H and G be finite groups and let k be a field. Furthermore, let M be an H  ×  G-bimodule where H acts on the left and G on the right. Then M*  =  Homk(M,k) becomes an H  ×  G-bimodule by setting

[formula]

for h∈H,g∈G,f∈M* and m∈M. Indeed, the module structure follows by

[formula]

Let M be an H  ×  G-bimodule. A k-bilinear form (  ·  ,  ·  ) on M is called H  ×  G-invariant if

[formula]

for all h∈H, all g∈G and all m,n∈M.

The next lemma is well-known. For the readers convenience we give the proof.

Let M be an H  ×  G-bimodule. Then M is isomorphic to M* as an H  ×  G-bimodule if and only if M carries a non-degenerate H  ×  G-invariant bilinear form. More precisely, if φ:M  →  M* is an isomorphism, then (m,m'): = φ(m)(m') is a non-degenerate H  ×  G-invariant bilinear form. If (  ·  ,  ·  ) is a non-degenerate H  ×  G-invariant bilinear form, then the map M∋m  ↦  (  ·  ,m)∈M* is an isomorphism of H  ×  G-bimodules.

Proof. If φ:M  →  M* denotes an H  ×  G-isomorphism we put

[formula]

for m,n∈M. Clearly, the form (  ·  ,  ·  ) is k-linear, but it is also H  ×  G-invariant since

[formula]

In addition (  ·  ,  ·  ) is non-degenerate since φ is an isomorphism.

Conversely, if (  ·  ,  ·  ) is a non-degenerate H  ×  G-invariant bilinear form on M then we put

[formula]

for all m,n∈M. Note that φ is a k-isomorphism since the bilinear form is non-degenerate. Furthermore, φ is H  ×  G-linear since

[formula]

and

[formula]

for all h∈H,g∈G and m,n∈M.

Let M be a self-dual H  ×  G-bimodule which is projective as a G-module. If V is a self-dual G-left module then [formula] is a self-dual H-left module. More precisely, if β:M  →  M* is an H  ×  G-linear isomorphism and α:V  →  V* is a G-linear isomorphism, then

[formula]

is an H-linear isomorphism.

Proof. Let β:M  →  M* denote an H  ×  G-isomorphism and α:V  →  V* a G-isomorphism. Therefore, since α and β are kG-linear the map [formula] is a well-defined k-vector space isomorphism satisfying [formula] for all m∈M and v∈V (cf. e.g. [\cite=CRold]).

Now, let m∈M,v∈V and h∈H. Since

[formula]

the map γ is H-linear.

Finally, we claim that

[formula]

as H-left modules. We prove this via a sequence of isomorphisms.

Observe that V* is not only a G-left but in a natural way also a G-right module via the definition

[formula]

for f∈V*,g∈G and v∈V.

Considering V* as G-right module HomkG(M,V*) makes sense. With this observation we have

Claim (i) [formula] as H-left modules. The isomorphism is given by sending α∈HomkG(M,V*) to the map [formula] with [formula] where m∈M and v∈V. Note, that Φ is well-defined since α is G-linear, for

[formula]

Furthermore, Φ is H-linear since

[formula]

Finally, α  →  Φ(α) is obviously a monomorphism. In order to show that Φ is an isomorphism we define a k-linear map

[formula]

by putting [formula] for [formula], m∈M and v∈V. Since φ is defined over [formula] we have

[formula]

for m∈M,g∈G and v∈V. Thus Ψ(φ)∈HomkG(M,V*). Moreover,

[formula]

for m∈M. Thus Φ is surjective, hence an isomorphism.

Claim (ii) [formula] as H-left modules:

The isomorphism is given by

[formula]

for α∈HomkG(M,kG) and f∈V* where

[formula]

for m∈M and v∈V. Here V* is considered as a G-right module by the natural action as defined above. Furthermore, the space HomkG(M,kG) is an H  ×  G-bimodule via the action

[formula]

for m∈M, g∈G, h∈H and f∈HomkG(M,kG).

First we show that the map [formula] is well-defined.

Indeed, for f∈V*, g∈G, α∈HomkG(M,kG), v∈V and m∈M one have

[formula]

Furthermore, the map [formula] is H-linear, for

[formula]

Thus it remains to prove that [formula] is a k-isomorphism. First we consider the case M = kG. Let α∈HomkG(kG,V*), hence

[formula]

where α(1)  =  f∈V* and ag∈k for g∈G. If id denotes the identity in HomkG(kG,kG) then

[formula]

hence   =  α. Thus the above map is an epimorphism, and therefore an isomorphism since the dimensions of the spaces in (ii) are obviously equal for M = kG. Since any free G-module is a direct sum of modules isomorphic kG the map [formula] is also an isomorphism if M is a free module. Since a projective module is a direct summand of a free module and since the isomorphisms are all compatible with taking direct summands the proof of (ii) is complete.

Claim (iii) [formula] as H  ×  G-bimodules: Abstractly this follows by Frobenius reciprocity [\cite=MacLane] and the fact that kG is a symmetric algebra. However, we need the isomorphism explicit. Let (  ·  ,  ·  ) be the symmetrising bilinear form making kG into a symmetric algebra. For all x,y∈kG the value of (x,y) is the coefficient of 1 in xy∈kG (cf. e.g. [\cite=CRold]). Then the map

[formula]

is a k-linear. If ρM(f) = 0 we get

[formula]

for all m∈M and all x∈kG. Since (  ·  ,  ·  ) is non degenerate f(m) = 0 for all m∈M and hence f = 0. Therefore ρM is injective.

Moreover, ρM is a morphism of H  ×  G-bimodules. Indeed, for g∈G and h∈H, for f∈HomkG(M,kG) and m∈M, we have

[formula]

and so [formula] which shows that ρM is H  ×  G-linear.

The inverse isomorphism is given by sending φ∈Homk(M,k) to ΛM(φ)∈HomkG(M,kG) defined by

[formula]

for m∈M: First note, that ΛM(φ) is G-linear since it is the trace under the G-action. Furthermore,

[formula]

for m∈M and φ∈Homk(M,k) where δ denotes the Kronecker symbol. Thus, ρM is surjective and ρ- 1M  =  ΛM is an isomorphism of H  ×  G-bimodules.

Since ΛM is H  ×  G-linear, [formula] is well defined (cf. e.g. [\cite=CRold]). Summarising (i), (ii) and (iii) we get explicit isomorphisms

[formula]

as H-left modules.

We need to verify the formula given in the Proposition.

[formula]

This complets the proof.

The following is the translation of the isomorphism given in Proposition [\ref=selfdualMorita] in terms of bilinear forms.

Let M be an H  ×  G-bimodule which is projective as a G-module. Suppose that M carries a non-degenerate H  ×  G-invariant non-degenerate bilinear form b. Let V be a G-left module with a non-degenerate G-invariant bilinear form B. Then, for m,m'∈M and v,v'∈V,

[formula]

defines a non-degenerate H-invariant bilinear form on [formula].

Proof. By Lemma [\ref=dualform], the bilinear form b is associated to an H  ×  G-isomorphism β:M  →  M* via

[formula]

for m,m'∈M. Similarly, B is associated to a G-isomorphism α:V  →  V* via

[formula]

for v,v'∈V. Proposition [\ref=selfdualMorita] shows that an isomorphism

[formula]

is given by

[formula]

Thus, by Lemma [\ref=dualform], the bilinear form [formula] defined on [formula] by

[formula]

is non-degenerate and H-invariant.

Proof of Theorem A. By Proposition [\ref=selfdualMorita], the functor [formula] maps self-dual G-modules to self-dual H-modules.

On the other hand, HomkH(M,kH) becomes a G  ×  H-bimodule via

[formula]

for all g∈G,h∈H and α∈HomkH(M,kH). Then HomkH(M,kH) is the inverse Morita bimodule to M and hence HomkH(M,kH) defines the inverse functor from the category of BH-modules onto the category of BG-modules. In order to prove the only if part it is, by Proposition [\ref=selfdualMorita], enough to show that the G  ×  H-bimodule HomkH(M,kH) is self-dual as well.

First note that

[formula]

as G  ×  H-bimodules (by Claim (iii) in the proof of Proposition [\ref=selfdualMorita], changing left- and right structures there). If we define a G  ×  H-structure on M by setting

[formula]

then the inverse of the given isomorphism HMG  →  HM*G defines an isomorphism from G(M*)H to [formula] and we are done.

Example [\ref=Example2] shows that not all Morita bimodules do admit a non-degenerate invariant bilinear form.

There are Morita equivalences which are induced by self-dual bimodules.

Morita equivalence and forms in odd characteristic

Throughout this section let k be a field of odd characteristic (which includes the characteristic 0 case as well). A G-module V is called of symmetric resp. antisymmetric type if V carries a non-degenerate G-invariant symmetric resp. antisymmetric bilinear form.

Let M be an H  ×  G-bimodule inducing a Morita equivalence between a kG-block BG and a kH-block BH. Suppose that M is of symmetric type. Let V be a self-dual G-left module. If V is of symmetric resp. antisymmetric type then [formula] is of symmetric resp. antisymmetric type.

Proof. Suppose b is a symmetric bilinear form and the bilinear form B is symmetric resp. antisymmetric if V is of symmetric resp. antisymmetric type. With the notation of Corollary [\ref=corollary1], we have

[formula]

where the +   sign appears for symmetric and the -   sign for antisymmetric type modules V.

Proof of Theorem B. This is an immediate consequence of Proposition [\ref=forms].

Now let V be a simple self-dual kG-module. Thus V carries a G-invariant non-degenerate bilinear form. If k is algebraically closed then - up to scalars - there is exactly one non-degenerate G-invariant form which is symmetric or antisymmetric since the characteristic is odd ([\cite=Huppert],Chap. VII, 8.12). Thus, for k algebraically closed, a simple self-dual G-module is either of symmetric or antisymmetric type but not of both. In particular, the Morita module M = ekG in Example [\ref=example3] is never of antisymmetric type since otherwise, by Proposition [\ref=forms], there are simple H-modules which are of symmetric and antisymmetric type. Indeed it is well-known, that a group algebra [formula] in odd characteristic never has a non-degenerate H-invariant antisymmetric form.

Morita equivalence and forms in even characteristic

In characteristic 2 the geometry of self-dual modules turns out to be more subtle. In this case an alternating form is symmetric. By Fong's Lemma ([\cite=Huppert], Chap. VII, Theorem 8.13), a simple non-trivial self-dual kG-module V always carries a non-degenerate G-invariant symplectic form, but it may happen that V even has a non-degenerate G-invariant quadratic form. This happens if H1(G,V) = 0 ([\cite=Sin-Wi], Proposition 2.4) and a connecting homomorphism to the first cohomology group carries the essential information what really happens. We call an arbitrary module [formula] of quadratic type if it carries a non-degenerate G-invariant quadratic form, say Q. The corresponding G-invariant non-degenerate symplectic form B defined by

[formula]

for v,v'∈V is called the Polarisation of Q. Note that the quadratic form Q is non-degenerate if

[formula]

Throughout the following k is assumed to be a perfect field of characteristic 2. The next Lemma can be found as Proposition 2.2 in [\cite=Gow-Wil].

Let P be a projective kG-module not containing the projective cover of the trivial module. Then each G-invariant symmetric form on P is the Polarisation of a G-invariant quadratic form on P.

We are now ready to prove Theorem C.

Proof of Theorem C. Let P be a projective kG-module of quadratic type. Then P is an orthogonal sum of orthogonal indecomposable modules. By ([\cite=Wil], Lemma 3.6), an orthogonal indecomposable module is either indecomposable or of the form [formula] where S is indecomposable. Since

[formula]

by Claim (i), (ii) and (iii) in the proof of Proposition [\ref=selfdualMorita] we need to prove the Theorem only for orthogonal indecomposable projective modules.

So let P be an orthogonal indecomposable projective kG-module in BG of quadratic type. Thus P carries a non-degenerate G-invariant symplectic form B which is also symmetric. According to Corollary [\ref=corollary1] the form [formula] defined by

[formula]

for m,m'∈M and p,p'∈P is a non-degenerate H-invariant bilinear form on [formula]. Since b and B are symmetric the form [formula] is symmetric as well. Thus, if the projective module [formula] does not contain the projective cover of the trivial kH-module, say PH(1), then [formula] is of quadratic type, by Lemma [\ref=even1]. In case it contains PH(1) it is either PH(1) or a direct sum of two copies of PH(1). But, by ([\cite=Wil], Remark 3.5 (b)), PH(1) and hence any finite direct sum of it is always of quadratic type if 2||H|. In case [formula] the trivial module k is projective and obviously of quadratic type. This completes the proof.

At the moment we are not able to prove an analogue of Theorem C for simple self-dual modules with the methods we have developed so far.
