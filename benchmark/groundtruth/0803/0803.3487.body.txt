On a Generalised Lehmer Problem for Arbitrary Powers

Introduction

Given modulus q  ≥  2, we denote by Uq the set

[formula]

In particular, #  Uq  =  φ(q), the Euler function.

For n∈Uq we use [formula] to denote the modular inverse of n, that is, the unique integer [formula] with [formula].

The classical question of D. H. Lehmer (see [\cite=Guy]) is about the joint distribution of the parity of n and its modular inverse [formula], defined by [formula].

W. Zhang [\cite=Zha1] [\cite=Zha2] has shown that the Weil bound of Kloosterman sums, see [\cite=IwKow], combined with some standard arguments, implies that if q is odd then n and its modular inverse [formula] are of the same parity [formula] times for n∈Uq.

This result has been extended in generalised in various directions, including its multidimensional analogues, see [\cite=ASZ] [\cite=CoZa] [\cite=LiuZha] [\cite=LRS] [\cite=Shp2] [\cite=XuZha] [\cite=YiZha] [\cite=ZXY] [\cite=ZhaZha] [\cite=Zha1] [\cite=Zha2] [\cite=Zha3] and references therein.

In particular, it has been shown by Y. Yi and W. Zhang [\cite=YiZha], that for any fixed integer k  ≠  0, the smallest positive residue modulo q of nk and its modular inverse [formula] are of the same parity [formula] times for n∈Uq.

Here we show that using the bound from [\cite=Shp1] of exponential sums with sparse rational functions, one can get the same (as in the case k = 1) error term [formula] for any fixed k and in fact obtain an asymptotic formula in a much more general case. Namely given an an integer s  ≥  2 s-dimensional integer vectors

[formula]

where [formula], we denote by [formula] the number of n∈Uq such that the smallest nonnegative residue of nkj modulo q is congruent to aj modulo mj for every [formula].

In particular, the result of Y. Yi and W. Zhang [\cite=YiZha] can be reformulated as the asymptotic formula,

[formula]

which holds for any odd q.

Here we give the following generalisation and improvement of [\eqref=eq:YZ_bound].

For any fixed integer s  ≥  2 and a vector [formula] without zero components, uniformly over all vectors [formula] with [formula] and an integer q  ≥  1 with

[formula]

we have

[formula]

In particular, for s = 2, m1  =  m2  =  2 and k1  =  k2  =  k, Theorem [\ref=thm:main] implies that the error term in the asymptotic formula [\eqref=eq:YZ_bound] is [formula] for every odd q  ≥  1.

Throughout the paper, the implied constants in the symbols 'O', and '≪  ' may depend on the vector [formula]. We recall that the notations U  =  O(V) and V  ≪  U are both equivalent to the assertion that the inequality |U|  ≤  cV holds for some constant c > 0.

Exponential Sums

For an integer [formula] we denote

[formula]

and recall that for [formula],

[formula]

(which follows immediately from the formula for the sum of a geometric progression).

We also recall that for any integers U  ≥  1 and μ with [formula] we have

[formula]

see [\cite=IwKow]. In particular

[formula]

and

[formula]

Finally, as we have mentioned, our main tool is the following slight generalisation of [\cite=Shp1] which gives an estimate of exponential sums with sparse rational functions. We note that in [\cite=Shp1] only the case of d = 1 has been considered, but the extension to the case of arbitrary d is straightforward.

For any fixed integer s  ≥  2 and a vector [formula] without zero components and an integer q  ≥  1, the bound

[formula]

holds, uniformly over all integers [formula] with

[formula]

Let

[formula]

be the prime number factorization of q and qi  =  q / pαii, [formula]. We now define ti as the modular inverse of qi modulo pαii, that is,

[formula]

for [formula]. Using the multiplicative property of exponential sums with rational functions, see [\cite=IwKow] or [\cite=Shp1], we obtain

[formula]

Furthermore, by [\cite=Shp1] we have

[formula]

for any prime power pα with pα  →    ∞   and integers [formula] with

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=eq:CRT] with [\eqref=eq:Bound] and using that

[formula]

(which follows from the obvious inequality ν!  ≤  q and the Stirling formula) we obtain the result.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]

Without loss of generality we may assume that [formula] has a nonnegative components satisfying 0  ≤  aj  <  mj, [formula].

Let us define Uj as the largest integers U with mjU  +  aj  <  q, [formula].

Then [formula] is equal to the number of solutions to the following system of congruences

[formula]

Since [formula], for every [formula] we consider the moduluar inverse [formula] of mj modulo q, and also define bj∈Uq by the congruence [formula]. Therefore, the system [\eqref=eq:Syst_Prelim] is equivalent to the the following system of congruences

[formula]

Using [\eqref=eq:ident] we write

[formula]

Changing the order of summation and then separating the main term

[formula]

corresponding to [formula], we obtain

[formula]

where Σ* means that the term corresponding to [formula] is excluded from the summation. Therefore,

[formula]

Now, for every divisor d|q we collect together the terms with the same value of [formula] and then apply Lemma [\ref=lem:Sparse], obtaining the estimate

[formula]

where

[formula]

Writing λj  =  dμj, [formula], and q  =  dqd, we derive

[formula]

Furthermore, we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

We have,

[formula]

Applying [\eqref=eq:Bound_1] to the sum over μj and [\eqref=eq:Bound_2] to the other sums (and using the trivial estimate Uh  ≤  q), we obtain

[formula]

for every [formula]. Substituting this in [\eqref=eq:Sigmadj], and then recalling [\eqref=eq:N_and_Sigmad], we obtain

[formula]

By the well-known estimate on the divisor function,

[formula]

see [\cite=HardyWright], we obtain

[formula]

It remains to notice that Uj  =  q / mj  +  O(1), [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

which concludes the proof.
