On the size of Nikodym sets in finite fields

Introduction

The finite field Kakeya problem, posed by Wolff in his influential survey [\cite=wolff], asks for the smallest subset of [formula] that contains a line in each direction, where [formula] denotes a finite field of q elements. A subset containing a line in each direction is called a Kakeya set. In analogy with the Euclidean Kakeya problem, Wolff conjectured that [formula] holds for any Kakeya set [formula], where Cn depends only on the dimension n. For n = 2 Wolff immediately proved the bound [formula], and it is best possible when q is even. To the author's knowledge, Blokhuis and Mazzocca [\cite=blokhuis] studied the finite field Kakeya problem in two dimensions and proved the sharp bound [formula] when q is odd, as conjectured by Faber in [\cite=faber]. The higher dimensional finite field Kakeya problem has been extensively investigated in [\cite=bourgainkatztao] [\cite=mockenhaupttao] [\cite=rogers] [\cite=taofourdimension] [\cite=wolff] such as proving the bound [formula] or [formula]. Recently, using the polynomial method in algebraic extremal combinatorics, Dvir [\cite=Dvir] completely confirmed this conjecture by proving

[formula]

On the other hand, Nikodym [\cite=nikodym] proved that there exists a null set in the unit square such that every point of the complement is "linearly accessible through the set", which means it lies on a line that is otherwise included in the set. Falconer [\cite=falconer] extended Nikodym's result to higher dimensions proving there exists a set [formula] of zero Lebesgue measure such that for each x∈Nc, there is a hyperplane P satisfying [formula]. In the Euclidean spaces Nikodym sets are closely related to Kakeya sets through Carbery's transformation [\cite=Carbery] [\cite=tao].

Motivated by the above works, we shall define a set B in [formula] to be Nikodym if for each x∈Bc there exists a line L such that [formula]. The main purpose of this note is to prove the lower bound

[formula]

Slightly different with the two dimensional finite field Kakeya problem, this bound is not best possible in two dimensions.

General dimensions

Any Nikodym set [formula] satisfies

[formula]

where [formula] denotes a finite field of q elements.

We argue by contradiction and suppose

[formula]

A basic result in combinatorics [\cite=Brualdi] says that the number of monomials in [formula] of degree at most d is

[formula]

hence there exists a nonzero polynomial [formula] of degree at most q - 2 such that

[formula]

For each x∈Bc, there exists a line L such that

[formula]

The restriction of g to this line is a univariate polynomial of degree at most q - 2, and since it has at least q - 1 zeros, it must be zero on the entire line L. Considering x belongs to this line, it follows that

[formula]

This would mean g is the zero polynomial, a contradiction.

Two dimensions

Any Nikodym set [formula] satisfies

[formula]

where [formula] denotes a finite field of q elements.

Write [formula]. First, assume that

[formula]

then

[formula]

Else suppose that

[formula]

Since B is a Nikodym set, for each x∈Bc there exists a line Lx such that

[formula]

Obviously, all of these lines are distinct from each other. Noting that there are in total q + 1 directions in [formula], we partition {Lx}x∈Bc into classes {Gi}qi = 0 according to their directions. Without loss of generality we may assume that

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

from which yields

[formula]

Choose s parallel lines {Xl}sl = 1 from G0, s parallel lines {Ym}sm = 1 from G1 and s parallel lines {Zn}sn = 1 from G2, then it follows that

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=estimate_1]) and ([\ref=estimate_2]) yields the desired result.

Question: How small can the Nikodym sets really be in two dimensions?
