1. Introduction

Birth-and-death processes are a powerful tool to describe stochastic models arising in population dynamics (see for instance Ricciardi [\cite=Ri]) and also in a large variety of applied fields, such as adaptive queueing systems and neurophysiology. In particular, their transition probabilities and first-passage-time densities play a relevant role in many applied contexts. Hence, obtaining closed form expressions for these functions is an important task. Unfortunately, apart from a few cases, such expressions are rarely encountered in the literature. Furthermore, procedures which have been successfully exploited for continuous-state processes are not suitable for point processes due to the discreteness of their state-space.

The aim of this note is to give an extension of a method leading to direct transformations between birth-and-death processes (cf. Di Crescenzo [\cite=Di94a] or [\cite=Di94b]) to the doubly infinite state-space case. Here we consider a preassigned birth-and-death process Xt whose state-space is the set of integers. In Section 2 we show how to construct a new birth-and-death process [formula] in such a way that the rates of the two processes are mutually related. As a consequence, their transition probabilities are related by a simple product-from relation. In Section 3 it is shown that also the first-passage-time densities of the two processes are similarly connected. We point out that the transformation from Xt to [formula] can be viewed as a method to construct new stochastic models. Indeed, making use of such method, starting from a birth-and-death process with constant rates, in Section 4 a new process is obtained.

2. Transition probabilities

Let {Xt;  t  ≥  0} be a birth-and-death process whose state-space is the set of integers [formula]. As usual, for all [formula] we denote by λn and μn the birth and the death rates of Xt, i.e.

[formula]

for all [formula]. We also assume that rates λn and μn are positive, so that the birth-and-death process has no absorbing or reflecting states. In this case Xt is said to be a bilateral birth-and-death process (cf. Ismail et al. [\cite=IsLeMaVa]). We also assume that Xt is simple; hence, the set of rates {λn,μn} uniquely determines the birth-and-death process. According to Callaert and Keilson (cf. [\cite=CaKe2]), a bilateral birth-and-death process is simple if and only if the two component birth-and-death processes, obtained by locating at n = 0 a boundary reflecting in both directions, are simple (necessary and sufficient conditions are also given in Pruitt [\cite=Pr]).

As Xt is simple, the transition probabilities [formula] are the unique solution of the following system:

[formula]

This has to be solved with initial conditions

[formula]

where [formula] is the initial state.

We shall now see that, under suitable assumptions, there exists a bilateral birth-and-death process [formula] having state-space [formula] whose rates are obtained from those of Xt and such that the transition probabilities of the two processes are mutually related by a product-form relation.

Let [formula] be a strictly monotonic sequence of positive numbers satisfying

[formula]

for all [formula]. If a bilateral birth-and-death process [formula] has rates

[formula]

then its transition probabilities are given by:

[formula]

Let

[formula]

Making use of ([\ref=equazione]), for all [formula] we have

[formula]

From relations ([\ref=condizione]) and ([\ref=rates]) it follows

[formula]

Hence, the previous system becomes:

[formula]

These are the forward equations of a bilateral birth-and-death process [formula], characterized by rates [formula]. The corresponding initial conditions are:

[formula]

Due to the uniqueness of the solution of the forward equations, probabilities p*k,n(t) and [formula] coincide, so that ([\ref=tildeprobtrans]) holds.

It should be noted that if the ratio λn  /  μn is a constant, a solution of system ([\ref=condizione]) can be easily obtained. Indeed, if there exists a positive constant c (c  ≠  1) such that μn = c  λn for all [formula], then one has:

[formula]

with β > 0.

3. First-passage-time densities

Let

[formula]

be the first-passage-time probability density function of Xt through the state s, conditioned upon the initial condition Pr {X0 = k} = 1, with k  ≠  s. In the following Theorem we determine the relations existing between the first-passage-time densities of the birth-and-death processes Xt and [formula].

Under the assumptions of Theorem [formula], the first-passage-time density [formula] of process [formula] with rates () is given by

[formula]

The transition probabilities and the first-passage-time density of [formula] are related by the integral equation

[formula]

which holds as k < s  ≤  n or n  ≤  s < k. Making use of relation ([\ref=tildeprobtrans]) one obtains:

[formula]

However, one also has:

[formula]

Comparing the last two integral equations, due to the uniqueness of their solution, identity ([\ref=relazioneg_1]) follows.

Bearing in mind that a first-passage-time density could be "defective", let us now pinpoint some further relations. If sequence {νn}n is increasing, from ([\ref=relazioneg_1]) one has:

[formula] if   s > k;

[formula] if   s < k.

Instead, when {νn}n is decreasing the inequalities between the first-passage-time densities are inverted.

For all k  ≠  s let us now introduce the ultimate crossing probabilities

[formula]

Integration of both sides in ([\ref=relazioneg_1]) over (0,  ∞  ) immediately yields

[formula]

As {νn}n is a strictly monotonic sequence, the ultimate crossing probabilities Pk,s and [formula] are never equal; hence, in particular, they cannot be simultaneously unity.

4. An example

In this Section we give an example of application of previous results. Let Xt be the bilateral birth-and-death process with constant rates λn  =  λ > 0, μn  =  μ > 0 [formula]. The transition probabilities and the first-passage-time density of Xt are given by (cf. Abate et al. [\cite=AbKiWh]):

[formula]

and

[formula]

respectively, where Ik is the modified Bessel function of first kind:

[formula]

Note that when λ  =  μ equation ([\ref=condizione]) does not admit of a positive non-constant solution. Instead, if λ  ≠  μ Theorem [\ref=tsimilproc] holds. Furthermore, from equality ([\ref=condizione]) for all [formula] one has:

[formula]

where c = μ  /  λ. Recalling expressions [\ref=rates], for all [formula] the rates of the birth-and-death process [formula] are given by:

[formula]

Furthermore, making use of equations ([\ref=tildeprobtrans]) and ([\ref=probAesempio]), the transition probabilities of [formula] follow:

[formula]

Finally, making use of Theorem [\ref=teoremag1], from ([\ref=probBesempio]) we obtain the first-passage-time density of [formula] from state k to state s:

[formula]
