Isoparametric hypersurfaces with four principal curvatures revisited

Introduction

In [\cite=CCJ], isoparametric hypersurfaces with four principal curvatures and multiplicities (m1,m2),m2  ≥  2m1 - 1, in spheres were classified to be exactly the isoparametric hypersurfaces of FKM-type constructed by Ferus Karcher and Münzner [\cite=FKM]. The classification goes as follows. Let M+ be a focal submanifold of codimension m1 of an isoparametric hypersurface in a sphere, and let N be the normal bundle of M+ in the sphere. Suppose on the unit normal bundle UN of N there hold true the four sets of equations

[formula]

for some smooth functions Lpba. Here, m: = m1 for notational ease. At n∈UN with base point x, the indices a (and b), p,α,μ run through, respectively, [formula], the subspace perpendicular to n in the fiber Nx, and the three eigenspaces of the shape operator An with eigenvalues 0,1, - 1. Also, Fija is, up to constant multiples, the (i,j)-component of the second fundamental form in the normal a-direction at x∈M+ pulled back to n∈UN, and θi and ωij are the coframe and connection forms on UN. We proved that these four sets of equations characterize an isoparametric hypersurface of FKM-type, on which the Clifford system acts on M+.

The first three sets of equations above are algebraic whereas the last one is a system of partial differential equations. We introduced in [\cite=CCJ] a spanning property on the 2nd fundamental form of M+, which says that the 2nd fundamental form is nondegenerate in the weaker sense that it is a surjective linear map from the subsapce of the direct sum of the aforementioned α and μ eigenspaces of the tangent space to the normal space, when one fixes any one of the two slots in the bilinear form. This spanning property turned out to be a crucial one for simplifying the four sets of equations, in that we proved that the spanning property and the first set of equations imply the three remaining sets of equations.

Our next crucial observation is that the first set of equations is really a formulation about Nullstellensatz in the real category in disguise, in view of an identity of Ozeki and Takeuchi [\cite=OT]. From this point onwards, we complexified to harness the rich complex algebraic geometry to our advantages, which eventually led to an induction procedure and an estimate on the dimension of certain singular varieties, to verify that the first set of equations and the spanning property always hold on M+ when m2  ≥  2m1 - 1, where m2 is the dimension of the other focal submanifold. Therefore, the isoparametric hypersuface is of FKM-type, on which the Clifford system acts on M+, if m2  ≥  2m1 - 1.

The only unsettled cases not handled by the bound m2  ≥  2m1 - 1 are exactly the exceptional ones with multiplicity pairs (3,4),(4,5),(6,9) and (7,8). It appears that handling these exceptional cases in general would entail taking all the four sets of equations into account.

The proof that these four sets of equations characterize an isoparametric hypersurface of FKM-type in [\cite=CCJ] is an extremely long calculation with remarkable cancellations, which is motivated by the idea that an isoparametric hypersurface is defined by an over-determined system of partial differential equations. Therefore, exterior differentiating the four sets of equations sufficiently many times should gather us enough information for the conclusion on a local scale, which then implies its global counterpart by analyticity. In spite of its elementary nature, the magnitude of the calculation and the surprisingly pleasant cacellations make it desirable to understand the underlying geometric principles.

The purpose of this paper is to give a conceptual, and considerably shorter, proof of the characterization that these four sets of equations are equivalent to that the underlying isoparametric hypersurface is of FKM-type. We first show that the first three sets of equations give rise to a manifold (diffeomorphic to a sphere of dimension m1) worth of intrinsic isometries of M+, whereas the fourth set of equations asserts that these intrinsic isometries extend to ambient isometries of the ambient sphere. We then explore further geometries of M+, in conjunction with Ozeki and Takeuchi's expansion formula of the Cartan-Münzner polynomial [\cite=OT], to verify that the sphere worth of isometries, when extended to ambient isometries, form a round sphere in the space of symmetric matrices. This says precisely that these isometries form a Clifford sphere, and so the isoparametric hypersurface is of FKM-type.

The work would not have been done without the inspiring papers of Ozeki and Takeuchi [\cite=OT].

Preliminaries

Unit normal bundle of a focal submanifold of an isoparametric hypersurfaces with four principal curvatures

Let

[formula]

be a submanifold with normal bundle

[formula]

Let UN be the unit normal bundle of M. The Riemannian connection on M splits the tangent bundle of UN in such a way that the horizontal vectors Xu at u = (x,n)∈UN are the ones satisfying

[formula]

Now let Mn be a focal submanifold of an isoparametric hypersurface in Sn + m + 1,n = m + 2N. For each point (x,n) on UN, we let Xp,m + 1  ≤  p  ≤  2m,Xα,2m + 1  ≤  α  ≤  2m + N,Xμ,2m + N + 1  ≤  μ  ≤  2m + 2N, be orthonormal basis eigenvectors with eigenvalues 0, 1, -1, respectively, of the shape operator An. Then these eigenvectors can be lifted to the tangent space at (x,n) via the isomorphism between the horizontal distribution at (x,n) and the tangent space to M at x. Explicitly, if

[formula]

is the embedding, then by [\eqref=eq1.5], for k  =  0,1, - 1, respectively,

[formula]

at (x,n) defines exactly the horizontal lift [formula] of X, when X is an eigenvector of the shape operator An with eigenvalue k. In fact, since

[formula]

by [\eqref=eq6.5], we have

[formula]

so that the tangent space to UN at (x,n) splits into

[formula]

where [formula] is the vertical space spanned by [formula], [formula] are horizontal subspaces spanned by vectors of the form [formula], in the p,α,μ ranges specified above, whose dual frames are θa,θp,θα,θμ, respectively.

Lie sphere geometry

Quantitatively, Lie sphere geometry provides an ideal ground for the unit normal bundle geometry. We will refer to the book [\cite=C] for details and further references. Consider [formula] with the metric

[formula]

of signature (n + m + 2,2). The equation < x,x >  = 0 defines a quadric Qn + m + 2 of dimension n + m + 2 in [formula]. A Lie sphere transformation is precisely a projective transformation of [formula] which maps Qn + m + 2 to itself. To realize the Lie sphere transformation group, consider, similar to an orthonormal frame in the case of an orthogonal group, a Lie frame, which is an ordered set of vectors [formula] in [formula] such that < Ya,Yb >  = hab, where

[formula]

where In + m is the identity matrix of the indicated size, J is the 2  ×  2 matrix with J11 = J22 = 0 and J12 = J21 = 1. A Lie frame induces a Lie transformation, and vice versa.

The unit tangent bundle of the sphere Sn + m + 1 now naturally identifies with Λ2n + 2m + 1, the space of dimension 2n + 2m + 1 of (projective) lines in Qn + m + 2, via the identification

[formula]

where the image of the map denotes the line spanned by the two points

[formula]

in Qn + m + 2. The unit normal bundle UN of a focal submanifold Mn of an isoparametric hypersurface in Sn + m + 1 therefore inherits a map into Λ2n + 2m + 1 via [\eqref=eq100]. In fact one can readily construct a local smooth Lie frame field on UN as follows. At (x,n)∈UN, we let Xa be a choice of orthonormal vertical frame fields, and Xp,Xα,Xμ be a choice of the respective orthonormal characteristic frame fields of An. Then

[formula]

is a Lie frame field. We set

[formula]

Then the Maurer-Cartan equations applied to (ωij), which lies in the Lie algebra of the Lie sphere group, imply

[formula]

An easy calculation shows that

[formula]

and

[formula]

where θa,θp,θα,θμ are the dual forms on UN introduced in the preceding section. Furthermore, we have

[formula]

Now, on UN we set

[formula]

where i,j,k run through the a,p,α,μ ranges. Note that Fijk =  - Fjik. Differentiating [\eqref=eq300] with [\eqref=eq200], [\eqref=eq700] and [\eqref=eq150] in mind, we obtain that Fijk = 0 whenever exactly two of the indices come from the same range. Moreover,

[formula]

In particular, [\eqref=eq350] and [\eqref=eq400] assert that

[formula]

We will see the meaning of Fμαp in the next section. Note that [\eqref=eq200] through [\eqref=eq400] also imply the structural equations (with Einstein summation convention)

[formula]

The symmetries

Consider the natural isometry

[formula]

from [formula] into itself.

Retaining the preceding notations, T leaves UN invariant in the case of four principal curvatures.

Proof. The exponential map

[formula]

of the sphere Sn + m + 1 maps UN to an isoparametric hypersurface Mt in general, and returns to the focal submanifold at t = π / 2, at which [formula] and the derivative of the map is - x, which is normal to the focal submanifold. [formula]

Any local section s:M  →  UN, s:x  ↦  (x,Q(x)), gives rise to a local map from M into itself.

Proof. Let π:UN  →  M be the projection. Consider the local map [formula], which is just the map

[formula]

[formula]

Since T is an isometry on UN, we next understand its tangent map. Note that by ([\ref=eq6.51]), at (x,n), we have the orthonormal frame (0,Xa),(Xp,0),(Xα, - Xα),(Xμ,Xμ) dual to θa,θp,θα,θμ. By the fact that T is a linear map interchanging the two coordinates, we obtain

[formula]

from the tangent space at (x,n) to the tangent space at (n,x) on UN, so that T* interchanges the Ea and Ep distributions and fixes the Eα and Eμ distributions.

It follows immediately from the proposition the following.

Fμαp at (x,n)∈UN is exactly Fμαa at (n,x)∈UN.

Consider now the local map

[formula]

arising from a local section s:M  →  UN,s:M  ↦  (x,Q(x)), in Corollary 1. We ask when g is a local isometry on the focal submanifold M.

Retain the notations in Corollary 1 and let Xp, Xα, and Xμ as before be appropriate orthonormal eigenvectors for the shape operator AQ(x). Then g is a local isometry of M if and only if s* maps Xα and Xμ to their horizontal lifts at (x,Q(x)), and maps Xp to (Xp,Vp) such that Xp  ↦  Vp is an isometry.

Proof. Let s*(Xp) = (Xp,Vp), s*(Xα) = (Xα, - Xα + Vα), and s*(Xμ) = (Xμ,Xμ + Vμ). That is, we break the three images under s* into horizontal and vertical components. By the very definition of g we see

[formula]

Since the vertical components Vp, Vα and Vμ are all perpendicular to Xp, Xα and Xμ, we see g* is a local isometry if and only if Vα = Vμ = 0. [formula]

At each point u = (x,n) of UN, we set, respectively, [formula] to be the vertical space at u and the three horizontal eigenspaces of the shape operator An with eigenvalue 0, 1, -1 pulled back to the horizontal space at u. In light of Lemma [\ref=1stlm], we assign smoothly an isometry Ou from [formula] to [formula]. Let

[formula]

at u and consider the distribution

[formula]

If this distribution is integrable, then according to Lemma [\ref=1stlm], each leaf Q(x) will induce an isometry on M. In accordance, we seek to find a necessary and sufficient condition for the distribution to be integrable. We can arrange so that

[formula]

Before we proceed, let us look at the isoparametric hypersurfaces of FKM-type [\cite=FKM]. Let [formula] be a Clifford system on [formula], which are orthogonal symmetric operators on [formula] satisfying

[formula]

The 4th degree homogeneous polynomial

[formula]

is the Cartan-Münzner polynomial, so that F- 1(t), - 1 < t < 1, on the sphere is a 1-parameter family of isoparametric hypersurfaces whose focal submanifolds are M± = F- 1(  ±  1).

M+ is the variety carved out by the quadrics [formula] whose normal bundle at x is spanned by [formula]. If we set [formula], where [formula], then {Q(x):x∈M+} is a leaf in the unit normal bundle of M+. These leaves, as Q varies, give rise to an integrable distribution Δ of the sort we are considering. In fact, at x the 0-eigenspace of the shape operator AQ(x) is spanned by PQ(x), where [formula] for all P. Therefore, a typical vector in the 0-eigenspace, say, Xp: = PQ(x), will be mapped via Q to - P(x) in the normal space at x, which we designate as - Xp - m. That is, - Xp - m = Q(Xp), which is compatible with [\eqref=eq1000].

Δ is involutive if and only if

[formula]

Proof. (Sketch.) Δ is the kernel of

[formula]

for all a, which we differentiate while invoke [\eqref=eq500]. [formula]

When Δ is involutive, the isometries g induced by the leaves of Δ extend to ambient isometries in Sn + m + 1 if and only if

[formula]

for some Lpba. In particular, the unit normal bundle of M+ of an isoparametric hypersurface of FKM-type satisfies [\eqref=eq18.1] through [\eqref=eq19.0].

Proof. We will show that each g* leaves the 2nd fundamental form and the normal connection form invariant, from which the rigidity follows [\cite=S].

Recall from Lemma 1 that we let Xα,Xp,Xμ be respective orthonormal characteristic vecotr fields of AQ(x) in M, and let Xa be orthonormal normal vector fields perpendicular to the normal vector Q(x) at x in M; in fact, Xa,Xp,Xα,Xμ form a Lie frame field over the section s. Recall that g:x  ↦  Q(x) is induced from the leaf s:x  ↦  (x,Q(x)), where

[formula]

by the definition of the distribution Δ. So we have from ([\ref=eq13]), ([\ref=eq14]) and ([\ref=eq15])

[formula]

To keep our notation straight, we let

[formula]

We set X- 1(x): = x,X0(x): = Q(x). Y- 1,Y0 and Ya are normal, and Yp,Yα,Yμ are tangent to M at g(x), in contrast to X- 1,X0 and Xa being normal and Xp,Xα,Xμ being tangent to M at x, when we regard M as a submanifold of [formula]. We therefore have set up a normal bundle isomorphism

[formula]

between the normal bundle of M over x and the normal bundle of M over g(x) covering g*.

The 2nd fundamental form at x is

[formula]

for X,Y∈TM, [formula], and is

[formula]

at g(x). In view of ([\ref=eq19.1]), ([\ref=eq19.2]), ([\ref=eq19.3]),

[formula]

where the third equality follows from the fact that the frames Xα are indeed smoothly defined as part of a Lie frame over the section s, so that the exterior differentiation can be conducted over s with respect to s*(Xα) that covers Xα. Likewise,

[formula]

So they are equal by [\eqref=eq400] and ([\ref=eq18.1]). We remark that a =  - 1,0 do not appear in the above equalities because, for instance,

[formula]

In the same vein, for [formula],

[formula]

where we invoke the fact that s*(Xp) = (Xp,0) + (0, - Xp - m) with (Xp,0) horizontal and (0, - Xp - m) vertical. Likewise,

[formula]

So they are equal by ([\ref=eq18.2]). Similar identities hold for other pairs of vectors. In short,

[formula]

The normal connection form is

[formula]

where Λba =  < dXa,Xb  >   at x and is

[formula]

where Θba =  < dYa,Yb  >   at g(x). We next establish

[formula]

that is,

[formula]

([\ref=eq20]) and ([\ref=eq21]) will establish the rigidity. Now

[formula]

while Λba(Xα) = 0 similarly. On the other hand,

[formula]

while

[formula]

Therefore they are equal if and only if ωba  -  ωb + ma + m annihilates s*(Xp), if and only if it annihilates the distribution Δ because it automatically annihilates the horizontal s*(Xα) and s*(Xμ) (Fijk = 0 if exactly two indices are from the same range), if and only if

[formula]

for some Lpba because θp - m  +  θp, for all p, form the dual of Δ. [formula]

The focal submanifold M+ is a real affine variety

Conversely, assuming now that [\eqref=eq18.1] through [\eqref=eq19.0] hold true, we will establish that the isoparametric hypersurface is of FKM-type.

By Proposition [\ref=prop], each leaf now is of the form (x,Q  ·  x) for some constant orthogonal matrix Q, so that in fact it induces a global isometry x  ↦  Q  ·  x on M. ("·  " denotes matrix multiplication.) Note also that since Q  ·  x is a normal vector at x∈M, we have < Q  ·  x,x >  = 0. In fact we have an Sm-worth of such Q's because there is a leaf through each point of a fiber of UN; let the set of the Sm-worth of Q's be denoted by C. Now C begins to look like the Clifford sphere. One needs to establish next the Clifford properties of the Q's in C.

We first show that

[formula]

for all Q in C. Retaining all the previous notations, we see that Q is exactly Ψ in ([\ref=eq19.4]). Hence x + Q  ·  x,Xa - Xa + m,Xμ are eigenvectors of Q with eigenvalue 1, while x - Q  ·  x,Xa + Xa + m,Xα are eigenvectors of Q with eigenvalue -1, which implies that Q is symmetric. So Q2 = Id because Q is also orthogonal.

M+ is the focal submanifold satisfying ([\ref=eq18.1]) through ([\ref=eq19.0]).

[formula]

so that M+ is a real affine variety.

Proof. For x in M+, Q  ·  x is a normal vector for any Q∈C. So clearly < Q  ·  x,x >  = 0. Conversely, the sphere Sn + m + 1 is covered by the exponential map

[formula]

with x in M+ and P in C. We ask when y satisfies < Q  ·  y,y >  = 0 for all Q. This is equivalent to, upon expansion, the condition

[formula]

for all Q in C. When picking Q to be P, we see by P2 = Id that this is in turn equivalent to sin 2t = 0. In other words, t = 0,π / 2, or π, which implies that y lies in M+. [formula]

More geometry of M+

Fix a point e∈M+. We have the decomposition

[formula]

where T and N are the tangent and normal spaces of M+ at e. We write a typical element in [formula] as

[formula]

where [formula], and w∈N, with respect to the decomposition. We will from now on coordinatize [formula] this way. Clearly, t =   ±  1,y = w = 0 are two points on M+. (M+ is diametrically symmetric.) Let

[formula]

be the cone over M+.

All identities to be derived below will not be hard to verify if C is a round sphere, which will be our end result. However, at this point C is only diffeomorphic to a sphere. What is remarkable is that the identities remain true under the weaker condition that C is a diffeomorphic sphere.

Let t0e + y0 + w0∈CM+. Then the line te + y0 + w0 parametrized by t intersects CM+ in exactly one point if w0  ≠  0.

Proof. First, note that < Pi  ·  e,e >  =  < Pi  ·  e,y0  >   = 0, since Pi  ·  e is a normal vector to M+ at e. Furthermore, < Pi  ·  w0,w0 >  = 0 because w0 / |w0|∈M+ as well by Proposition [\ref=PROP]. It follows that for 0  ≤  i  ≤  m, we have

[formula]

for te + y0 + w0∈CM+. Since [formula], form an orthonormal basis for the normal space N of M+ at e, if we set

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

Multiplying through ([\ref=eq24]) by wi and summing up over i, we obtain

[formula]

If w0  ≠  0, then there is only one solution for t. [formula]

We record that, along the normal vector P  ·  e, we have

[formula]

where P∈C, S is the 2nd fundamental form and v1 and v2 are two tangent vectors to M+ at e. That is, we have

[formula]

where the upper script T denotes orthogonal projection onto the tangential component at e for an tangent vector v. The identity is true because P  ·  x, as x varies around e in M+, is a normal vector field, whose derivative at e gives [\eqref=eq30000]. For notational ease, we set

[formula]

Let t0e + y0 + w0∈CM+,w0  ≠  0. Then t0 is the double root of the quadratic polynomial (in t)

[formula]

Proof. Squaring ([\ref=eq24]) and summing over i, we obtain the polynomial for which t0 is a root. Conversely, suppose t is a root of the polynomial. Tracing backwards, we obtain ([\ref=eq24]) and so ([\ref=extra]). This implies that t = t0. [formula]

Now we compare ([\ref=eq25]) with the equation derived in [\cite=OT]. Let F be the 4th degree homogeneous Cartan-Münzner polynomial. Then

[formula]

where [formula], are some cubic homogeneous polynomials in y; in fact, they are the 3rd fundamental forms of M+.

t0e + y0 + w0∈CM+,w0  ≠  0. Then t0 is the double root of the quadratic polynomial (in t)

[formula]

where P∈C is such that

[formula]

and [formula] denotes the orthogonal projection onto the normal space N to M+ at e.

Proof.

[formula]

if te + y0 + w0∈CM+, because F(x) = 1 for x∈M+; f is a 2nd order polynomial in t by [\eqref=eq26]. The only messy term in f is the one involving [formula] in ([\ref=eq26]). However, since

[formula]

we have, in view of [\eqref=eq30000],

[formula]

due to the fact that P is orthogonal. Hence t0 is a root of f as a polynomial of t.

Conversely, suppose t is a root of the polynomial f. Then te + y0 + w0 must belong to CM+. Thus by Lemma 4, we have t = t0. [formula]

Henceforth, we drop the subscript 0 from y0 and w0 for notational ease.

[formula]

and

[formula]

for all te + y + w∈CM+. As a consequence, for w  ≠  0,

[formula]

Moreover, the projection of CM+ onto the [formula]-space is the variety carved out by the equations

[formula]

for all [formula].

Proof. The first two equations are apparently true for w = 0. For w  ≠  0, they follow from comparing the coefficients of ([\ref=eq25]) and ([\ref=eq27]), since both quadratic polynomials have the same double root. The third equation is a consequence of the first and ([\ref=extra]). Finally, the last set of equations follow from ([\ref=eq24]) and the third equation. [formula].

Notation as above, for e∈M+, there is an open set U in T such that for each point y∈U, there are only a finite number of w∈N (and hence finitely many t) for which te + y + w∈M+ with the property that these w span N.

Proof. Consider the orthogonal projection π:M+  →  T given by te + y + w  ↦  y. The map π is surjective onto a neighborhood of y = 0, because π is in fact a local diffeomorphism near e due to the fact that T is tangent to M+ at e. By Sard's theorem, the regular values of π in this neighborhood form a dense and open set S. Pick an open ball U in S. The preimage of π over each point in U is finite with a fixed number of elements, so that π is a covering map over U.

Suppose for some y in U, the elements of π- 1(y) is contained in a proper subplane L of [formula], then a slight perturbation from y to a nearby y' in T will disconnect the pertured image of the plane [formula] from M+, which contradicts the constancy of the number of elements of preimages near y, as a slight perturbation does not alter the intersection number. Therefore, the elements of π- 1(y) span [formula]. However, since t is a function of y and w  ≠  0 by [\eqref=eq29], we see that the elements of π- 1(y) projects to elements in N which span N. [formula]

Lemma [\ref=general] enables us to say more about [\eqref=eq4000] now.

Let te + y + w∈CM+. Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

Proof. The identities are trivially true if w = 0. We assume w  ≠  0 now. Recall P from [\eqref=eq27]. We claim that if t  ≠  0, then

[formula]

if and only if

[formula]

To see this, note first of all, that [formula] means y belongs to the direct sum of the ±  1-eigenspace of the shape operator AP  ·  e at e. To see this, recall that Q  ·  e traces out the unit normal sphere of M+ at e as Q varies in C. Therefore, [formula] gives

[formula]

However, since P is a normal bundle isomorphism of M+, P maps the unit normal sphere at e to that at P  ·  e. That is, PQ  ·  e traces out the unit normal sphere at P  ·  e as Q varies in C. On the other hand, the unit normal sphere at P  ·  e generates [formula], where E0 is the 0-eigenspace of AP  ·  e, by Proposition [\ref=PROPOSITION]. Hence, [\eqref=eq7000] asserts that y belongs to the direct sum of the ±  1-eigenspace of the shape operator AP  ·  e. In particular, [\eqref=eq8000] follows because it is equivalent to [formula], i.e.,

[formula]

for all i. However, we know PiP  ·  e are unit normal vectors at the point P  ·  e, by the construction of C, which are thus vectors in [formula]. In particular, [\eqref=eq9000] and so [\eqref=eq8000] hold true if [\eqref=eq10000] does, proving one direction of the claim.

Conversely, assume

[formula]

Set r = :|w|, n = :w / |w| and ni = :wi / |w|. Substituting ([\ref=eq29]) into ([\ref=eq25]) and ([\ref=eq27]), with ([\ref=eq28]) in mind, we derive

[formula]

and

[formula]

where we also employ the identity

[formula]

which follows from [\eqref=eq30000].

We observe that [\eqref=eq80000] is equivalent to

[formula]

for all i by [\eqref=eq24]. Also,

[formula]

because [\eqref=eq80000] implies the first two terms of [\eqref=eq33] vanish, and so

[formula]

hold by [\eqref=eq34]. Substituting [\eqref=100000] into the right hand side of [\eqref=eq96000], we obtain

[formula]

by the identity [formula] [\cite=OT]. Therefore,

[formula]

and the claim is established.

By the claim, for t  ≠  0, either both sides of [\eqref=eq32] are zero, in which case [\eqref=eq31] holds as well by [\eqref=eq4000], so that our proof is done, or we can from now on assume that both sides of [\eqref=eq32] are nonzero. Now since

[formula]

< Pi  ·  y,w > 2  ≠  0 for some i, for which [\eqref=eq30], which is

[formula]

asserts that there is a single r  ≠  0 satisfying both [\eqref=eq33] and [\eqref=eq34], so that in the case when

[formula]

([\ref=eq33]) and ([\ref=eq34]) have the same nonzero double roots. Hence, we compare the coefficients of ([\ref=eq33]) and ([\ref=eq34]) to conclude ([\ref=eq31]) and ([\ref=eq32]). On the other hand, if

[formula]

then [\eqref=eq55000] implies

[formula]

from which the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality asserts that

[formula]

for some λ, so that

[formula]

by [\eqref=eq28]. This forces r = 0 by [\eqref=extraformula] and [\eqref=eq33], which is absurd since w  ≠  0. Hence, [\eqref=eq31] and [\eqref=eq32] are verified, when t  ≠  0.

Lastly, we observe that the points in CM+ with t = 0 is a proper subvariety in CM+ due to the nondegeneracy of M+ in the ambient sphere. Therefore, as the points te + y + w,t  ≠  0, approach points with t = 0 in CM+, we see by continuity that [\eqref=eq31] and [\eqref=eq32] remain true. [formula]

[formula]

holds true for all y∈T and all w∈N.

Proof. By the preceding lemma, the same equation is valid for the finite w over each y in U defined in Lemma [\ref=general]. However, these finite w generate the space N for each y∈U by Lemma [\ref=general]; so the equality is true for all N at each y∈U since both sides of the equation are linear in w. Hence the equation must be true for all T and N since homogeneous polynomials are analytic. [formula]

In fact, one can see from [\cite=OT] that

[formula]

where F(x1,x2,x3,x4) is the symmetric function associated with the Cartan-Münzner polynomial. Hence by ([\ref=eq35]), we have derived

[formula]

The final argument

Now we come to the crucial lemma.

Let [formula] and [formula] be two orthonormal bases for the normal space N to M+ at e, where [formula]. Let

[formula]

for some constant orthogonal matrix (Aij). Then

[formula]

Proof. By [\eqref=eq36], we have

[formula]

Now since

[formula]

by [\eqref=eq1001] and [\eqref=eq2000], we have immediately

[formula]

which results in, by [\eqref=eq37],

[formula]

for all y∈T and w∈N. For ease of notation, set

[formula]

In particular, ([\ref=37.5]) implies that

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

where the superscript T denotes the orthogonal projection onto T. That it is equal to zero comes from the fact that, e.g., PTi is just the shape operator APi  ·  e, and therefore the correct transformation compatible with [\eqref=eq36.5] prevails. We conclude that

[formula]

for all y∈T. On the other hand,

[formula]

for all w∈N. This is because first of all, e.g., < Pi  ·  w,Pj  ·  e >  = 0. For, again PiPj  ·  e is in the span of e and the 0-eigenspace of APj  ·  e, so that as a result [formula] is perpendicular to the normal space N; moreover,

[formula]

by ([\ref=eq38]) and the fact that the operators involved are symmetric, so that [formula] is also perpendicular to T. Lastly

[formula]

since

[formula]

automatically by ([\ref=eq36.5]). The upshot is that

[formula]

for all y∈T.

We are now in the situation where we have m + 1 constant matrices [formula] such that

[formula]

for all y∈T. If one of Mi is nonzero, we will find constants [formula], not all zero, such that

[formula]

for all y∈T, by looking at an appropriate matrix entry. In other words, the symmetric matrix

[formula]

(A is the shape operator) satisfies < M  ·  y,y >  = 0 for all y. Thus M = 0, which implies that the shape operator An, where n is the unit normal vector normalized from the vector [formula], will be identically zero. This is a contradiction, since we know all the shape operators for M+ have 0,  ±  1 as eigenvalues. In conclusion, all Mi = 0, which is what we want to prove. [formula]

C is the Clifford sphere if and only if [\eqref=eq18.1] through [\eqref=eq19.0] hold.

Proof. This follows immediately from the preceding lemma, because it says that C is the round sphere in the space of symmetric endomorphisms, if [\eqref=eq18.1] through [\eqref=eq19.0] hold. Conversely, we have seen that an isoparametric hypersurface of FKM-type satisfies [\eqref=eq18.1] through [\eqref=eq19.0]. [formula].
