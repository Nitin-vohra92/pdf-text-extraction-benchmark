Upper bounds for the number of limit cycles of some planar polynomial differential systems

Main result

One of the few general methods that allows to give upper bounds for the number of limit cycles of planar differential systems is the use of Dulac functions in multiple connected regions, see [\cite=Cherkas] [\cite=CG1] [\cite=CG2] [\cite=GG] [\cite=Lloyd] [\cite=Yamato]. Recall that the primer idea is that when the function [formula] does not vanish on a simply connected region [formula] then the above differential system has no periodic orbit totally contained in U. We state the general Bendixson-Dulac Criterion in next section, see Theorem [\ref=A]. The main difficulty for practical uses of this result is that it is needed to find a (Dulac) function g such that [formula] does not vanish on a suitable set. This paper gives a quite general result for polynomial differential systems, see Theorem [\ref=MT]. Its proof is based on a "good" choice of a Dulac function. As we will see in Section [\ref=se3] this result provides a constructive way for giving upper and lower bounds for the number of limit cycles of a large class of planar polynomial systems.

Given a polynomial [formula] we will say that the couple [formula] is a Dulac pair of p(s) if

[formula]

As we will see in Lemma [\ref=lema] and in the proof of Proposition [\ref=B], the above inequality implies that the function |w(r)|- 1 / k is a Dulac function, in any of the connected components of [formula] for the systems that in polar coordinates, r and θ, writes as [formula] Here p̂ is any arbitrary polynomial. We remark that there is no need to introduce this Dulac pair to study the phase portrait of this system. For instance their limit cycles are given by the positive zeros of p that are not zeros of p̂. Nevertheless, as we will see in next theorem, Dulac pairs are useful to study more general systems.

Next remarks collect some comments on the above result.

Let us see how the theorem works in a concrete example. We will prove that the system

[formula]

has exactly two limit cycles. Examples with parameters will be studied in Section [\ref=se3]. Following the notation of the theorem we get that p(s) = 4 - 79s / 16 + s2. Moreover, by using Proposition [\ref=nueva] we take w(r) = r2p'(r2) = r2(2r2 - 79 / 16). Finally we choose k = 4 / 5. We have

[formula]

By using Sturm's rule it is easy to prove that pk,w(r) < 0 for all [formula] and so (k,w(r)) is a Dulac pair for p. Straightforward computations give that

[formula]

By using rough bounds like

[formula]

we get that

[formula]

and it can be proved by using Sturm's rule that it is negative for all r > 0. Therefore, since w has two non-negative roots, m+ = 2 and the system has at most two (hyperbolic) limit cycles.

It is clear that the origin is an unstable focus. By taking the resultant of P and Q, for instance with respect to y, and applying Sturm's rule to this new polynomial we prove that the origin is the unique critical point of the system. By studying the flow of the system on the circles {x2 + y2 = R2} for R big enough, and on {x2 + y2 = r20}, where r0 is the positive root of w, and using the above information we deduce that the two limit cycles actually exist. Indeed one of them is in D  =  {x2 + y2 < r20} and is stable and the other surrounds D and is unstable.

In fact, we have presented the study of system [\eqref=mot] in this introduction because it shows at the same time the power and the limitations of the method. By one hand, for a concrete system which has no a priori structure, we can give the exact number of limit cycles. On the other hand, in all the cases that we have studied, for polynomials systems of degree 2n or 2n + 1 it only has been applicable for systems having at most n limit cycles and when all these limit cycles are hyperbolic and nested.

Due to the extreme difficulty of the second part of the Hilbert's sixteenth problem it is never easy to give explicit and realistic upper bounds for the number of limit cycles of a planar polynomial system. Moreover most results in the literature can only be applied to control the limit cycles of particular types of differential systems, namely Liénard systems, quadratic systems, cubic systems, systems with homogeneous nonlinearities, etc, giving usually upper bounds of 0, 1 or 2 limit cycles, see for instance [\cite=Cherkas0] [\cite=Ye] [\cite=Z]. The criterion proved in Theorem [\ref=MT] is not subject to these restrictions.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 contains some preliminary results and the proof of Theorem [\ref=MT]. In Section [\ref=se3], we will apply this result to different families of differential systems providing in all of them explicit upper bounds for the number of limit cycles. In fact, we present two examples with limit cycles surrounding a unique critical point (see Examples 1 and 2), two situations with a limit cycle surrounding several critical points (see Examples 3 and 4) and finally a family of examples of differential systems showing that, in the set of systems of the form [\eqref=eq2], there are many open subsets of systems satisfying all the hypotheses of the theorem.

Preliminary results and proof of Theorem A

Let [formula] be an open set with smooth boundary and such that its fundamental group, π1(U), is [formula] or in other words having [formula] gaps. For short we will say that U is an [formula]-punctured  open set and we will denote by [formula] its number of gaps. Notice that with this notation, simply connected sets are 0-punctured sets and multiple connected sets are [formula]-punctured sets with [formula]

The following result is a well known extension of the Bendixson-Dulac Criterion to [formula]-punctured sets. For a proof, see any of the papers [\cite=GGi] [\cite=Lloyd] [\cite=Yamato].

We will prove and use the following corollary of the above theorem.

Consider the C1-differential system

[formula]

and set X = (P,Q). Assume that there exist a positive real number k and a polynomial f(x,y) such that

[formula]

does not vanish in an open region with regular boundary [formula] Let U1, U2,[formula] Um, be the connected components of [formula] Then

The periodic orbits of system [\eqref=bis] contained in W never cut the set {f = 0}.

The maximum number of limit cycles of system [\eqref=bis] contained in each Uj, [formula] is [formula] and all of them are hyperbolic. Moreover their stability is given by the sign of - fMk on each region.

The maximum number of limit cycles of system [\eqref=bis] in W is [formula] and all them are hyperbolic.

Since Mk does not vanish on W we know that [formula] does not vanish. Therefore the periodic orbits of [\eqref=bis] which are totally contained in W never cut the set {f = 0} and (i) follows. To prove items (ii) and (iii) it suffices to apply Theorem [\ref=A] to each one of the connected components [formula] Note that, on each of them, the function g = |f|- 1 / k is smooth and moreover

[formula]

Therefore the upper bound for the number of limit cycles follows.

Finally we prove the hyperbolicity of all the limit cycles. Let γ  =  {(x(t),y(t))  :  t∈[0,T]} be one of them. We must prove that [formula] see for instance [\cite=DLA]. Since γ does not intersect the set {f = 0} we have that over γ

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

and its stability is given by the sign of - fMk on the region where γ lies. Therefore the result follows.

To apply the above result, it will be useful to get the expression of the function Mk given in the Proposition [\ref=B] in terms of the components of the differential system [\eqref=bis], written in polar coordinates.

Let [formula] be the expression of system [\eqref=bis] in polar coordinates. Then the function [\eqref=eme] writes as

[formula]

Let p(s) be a real polynomial having all its roots real and simple.

(i) For all [formula]

[formula]

(ii) For each [formula] define the new polynomial

[formula]

Then there exists k, with |k - 1| small enough, such that qk(r) < 0 for all [formula]

It is not restrictive to write [formula] with si  ≠  sj for i  ≠  j. From the equalities

[formula]

item (i) follows.

To prove (ii) notice that by item (i)

[formula]

Moreover [formula] for some polynomial [formula] of degree 4l and

[formula]

where [formula] Note that p(0)p''(0) - (p'(0))2 = 2c0c2 - c21 < 0 and thus, for |k - 1| small enough, (1 - k)l2 - kl and c21 + 4c0c2 - 2k(c21 + c0c2) are both negative. Hence when c0c1 = 0, taking |k - 1| small enough, we can always ensure that the sign of qk(r) is negative in [formula] When [formula] in addition we have to take k such that c0c1(1 - k) < 0.

Let p(s) be a real polynomial. Then

If p(s) has all its roots real and simple by taking w(r) = r2p'(r2) and some k near 1 then (k,w(r)) is a Dulac pair of p(s).

If p(s) has some real multiple positive root then it has no Dulac pair.

There are many polynomials p(s) with complex roots also having Dulac pairs.

(i) Note that

[formula]

where qk is given in Lemma [\ref=le1]. By using this lemma the result follows.

(ii) Let s* > 0 be one of these roots. It is easy to see that for any couple k and w, the polynomial pk,w(r) also vanishes at [formula]. Hence the result follows.

(iii) We construct a class of polynomials for which the result holds. Let p(s) be a polynomial such that p(s) = p1(s)p2(s) where p1(r2) + r2p1'(r2) > 0 for all [formula] and [formula] being r2i different positive numbers. Consider w(r) = p2(r2) and k = 1. Then

[formula]

Take now wε(r) = p2(r2) + ε2p2'(r2). Then

[formula]

for some polynomial W of the same degree that p1,w. Moreover

[formula]

for all [formula] Hence for |ε| small enough the polynomial p1,wε(r) is negative for all [formula] as we wanted to prove.

Next lemma will be useful to get systems for which the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=MT] hold and to prove that the upper bound given by the theorem is optimal.

Consider system

[formula]

where u and v are arbitrary real polynomials. If u has all their roots real and simple then, taking w(r) = r2u'(r2), the function Φ1,w(r) introduced in Theorem [\ref=MT] is negative for all r∈(0,  ∞  ).

Writing the system in polar coordinates we obtain

[formula]

Clearly, from the above expression we get p = u, where p is the polynomial introduced in Theorem [\ref=MT]. Thus, taking k = 1 and w(r) = r2u'(r2), we obtain

[formula]

By using Lemma [\ref=le1].(i) the result follows.

We apply Proposition [\ref=B] to system [\eqref=eq2] with f(r,θ) = w(r) and the value k given in the statement of the Theorem. Then, by using Lemma [\ref=le2], we get that the expression of Mk given in Proposition [\ref=B] is where M(r,k,θ,w) is the function given in Theorem [\ref=MT].

Moreover, by hypothesis, we have

[formula]

for all r∈(0,  ∞  ). Therefore, by Proposition [\ref=B], the maximum number of limit cycles can be bounded above by studying the topology of the connected components of the set [formula] Clearly it has m+ connected components, all of them indeed 1-punctured when w(0) = 0 and it has m+ + 1 connected components when [formula]. Notice that in this later case one of them is simply connected and the other m+ are 1-punctured sets. In any case, again by Proposition [\ref=B], there is no limit cycle in the simply connected component and there is at most one limit cycle in each of the 1-punctured components, which is hyperbolic when it exists. Moreover, since Mk < 0, its stability is given by the sign of w on each component. As it is already said in Remark [\ref=re1].(ii), it can be proved that the bounded 1-punctured components of W not having critical points of system [\eqref=eq2] contain effectively a limit cycle. This result holds because each one of these rings is either positively or negatively invariant by the flow of the system.

Examples

Example 1

Consider the system

[formula]

which has at the origin an unstable focus. Let us see that when b < 8 and a,c and d are such that

[formula]

for all r > 0, then it has at most one limit cycle, which when exists is hyperbolic and stable.

We apply Theorem [\ref=MT]. Then p(s) = ((b - 8)s + 8) / 8. By using Proposition [\ref=nueva] we take w(r) = r2p'(r2) = (b - 8)r2 / 8 and we choose k = 7 / 10. Then

[formula]

Analogously that in the example given in the introduction, we have

[formula]

for all r > 0 and we are under the hypotheses of the theorem. Since m+ = 1 the uniqueness of the limit cycle follows. It is easy to see that for a,b,c and d small enough the condition on Ψa,b,c,d holds and the limit cycle exists.

Note that for this system we can give a simple and explicit condition on the parameters of the system under which we can prove that there is at most one limit cycle. For instance the condition holds for a = c = 1 and - 2b = 2d = 1. For these values we have also checked numerically that the limit cycle actually exists.

Example 2

Consider the system

[formula]

If a,b and c are such that

[formula]

for all r > 0, then system [\eqref=eqex2] has at most two (hyperbolic) limit cycles. Moreover, when they exist, one is included in the disc [formula] and is stable and the other one is outside the disc and is unstable.

The proof follows again by using Theorem [\ref=MT]. We take p(s) = 2 - 3s + s2, and by Proposition [\ref=nueva], we consider w(r) = r2p'(r2) = r2( - 3 + 2r2) and k = 1. Then

[formula]

Hence, for the values of the parameters considered, we have

[formula]

for all r > 0. Thus we can apply Theorem [\ref=MT] with m+ = 2, proving the existence of at most two (hyperbolic) limit cycles.

For instance the condition on Ψa,b,c holds for a = 1 / 8, b = 1 / 15 and c = 1 / 20. Moreover for these parameters it is not difficult to prove, by using resultants and the Sturm's rule, that the origin is the unique critical point, which is unstable. Finally, by studying the flow on {x2 + y2 = R2}, for R big enough, and on {x2 + y2 = 3 / 2}, we prove the existence of both limit cycles.

Example 3

Consider the system

[formula]

If a and b are such that

[formula]

for all r > 0, Theorem [\ref=MT] will allow us to show that system [\eqref=eqex3] has at most two limit cycles. Moreover we will see that when there is no critical point outside the disc [formula] an unstable hyperbolic limit cycle always exists outside the disc D and it surrounds several critical points.

We take p,w and k as in the previous example. Then

[formula]

Hence, when the conditions on the parameters hold we have

[formula]

for all r > 0 and we can apply Theorem [\ref=MT]. In this case since m+ = 2 we know that system [\eqref=eqex3] has at most two limit cycles, and whenever they exist, one is inside the disc D and is hyperbolic and stable and the other one is outside the disc, and is hyperbolic and unstable. Since system [\eqref=eqex3] has several critical points in the disc D, (0,0) and [formula] among them, the unstable limit cycle, when it exists, surrounds these points.

An example of parameters for which Ψa,b is negative is a = 1 / 20 and b = 1 / 15. Using the same tools that in the previous case we can prove that the system has exactly five critical points and all them are inside D. Hence by studying the flow on the boundary of D and on {x2 + y2 = R2}, for R big enough, we prove the existence of an unstable limit cycle surrounding D.

In short, for these values of the parameters we have proved that system [\eqref=eqex3] has at most two limit cycles and the existence of a limit cycle, which surrounds the five real critical points of the system, which are in D. Our numerical explorations indicate that this limit cycle is unique.

We want to stress that there are very few results in the literature giving upper bounds for the number of limit cycles surrounding several critical points. Notice that the critical points different of the origin, surrounded by the limit cycle, come from the continua of critical points {x2 + y2 = 1} that system [\eqref=eqex3] possesses when a = b = 0. The limit cycle is born in {x2 + y2 = 2}.

Example 4

Consider the system

[formula]

Let us prove that when a is such that

[formula]

for all r > 0, it has at most 3 limit cycles. Once more we use Theorem [\ref=MT]. In this occasion we take k = 1, p(s) = (1 - s)(2 - s)(3 - s) and [formula] Then

[formula]

Since m+ = 3 and M(r,θ,k,w)  ≤  r4Ψa(r) < 0 for all r > 0, the existence of at most 3 limit cycles follows. For instance the above hypothesis holds for a = 1 / 34. For this value of the parameter we prove, by using the same tools that in the previous examples, that the system has several critical points and that, apart from the origin, all of them are contained in the ring [formula] Finally, again similarly that in the previous cases, we prove that there is exactly one hyperbolic and stable limit cycle inside the disc [formula] and another hyperbolic and also stable limit cycle outside the disc [formula]

The novelty of this example is the existence of a non-trivial system for which the maximum number of limit cycles is known (it is 3). Moreover it has at least two hyperbolic limit cycles, one of them surrounding only the origin and the other one surrounding the first limit cycle and having several critical points between them.

We want to comment that our numerical exploration seems to indicate that there is no limit cycle contained in C, and so that the maximum number of limit cycles of the system for this value of the parameter is two.

Example 5

This last example is interesting from a theoretical point of view. Consider the system

[formula]

where u and v are given real polynomials of degree j and assume u is such that all their roots are real and simple. Let m+ - 1 denote the number of positive real roots of u'. Then, for any couple of polynomials [formula] and [formula] whose monomials have degrees between 2 and 2j + 1, both included, there exists [formula] such that if |ε| < ε0 then system [\eqref=triper] is under the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=MT]. Moreover, under these conditions, it has at most m+ limit cycles and all the existing limit cycles are hyperbolic.

When ε = 0, the above assertions follow from Lemma [\ref=tri] and Theorem [\ref=MT]. Consider [formula] By using Proposition [\ref=nueva] we can take w(r) = r2u'(r2) and fix a value k > 0 for which

[formula]

for all r∈(0,  ∞  ). The function p(s,ε) for system [\eqref=triper] defined in Theorem [\ref=MT] writes as [formula] for some new polynomial [formula] also of degree j. It is clear that for |ε| small enough, the polynomial [formula] has also all its roots real and simple and the number of positive roots of [formula] is m+ - 1. By taking the same value of k and [formula] we get that the function M in the theorem writes as

[formula]

where the functions [formula] are smooth and 2π-periodic in θ. Since pk,w(r) is a negative polynomial in (0,  ∞  ) of the form [formula] for some bi real numbers and, moreover b2 < 0 and b4j < 0, it is clear that for |ε| small enough the function Φk(r,ε) given in Theorem [\ref=MT] is negative as we wanted to prove. Moreover it follows that the maximum number of limit cycles of system [\eqref=triper] is m+, and whenever they exist they are hyperbolic.

Notice that it is always true that when a planar system has m+ hyperbolic limit cycles any small perturbation also has at least the same number of hyperbolic limit cycles. The point of the above example is not only to prove the existence of at most this number of limit cycles, but to prove that there are planar polynomial systems under the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=MT] for which all planar systems of the same degree near them are also under the hypotheses of the theorem. Moreover, as we can see in the study of the previous examples, our approach allows to get explicit bounds for the size of the perturbation under which our theorem can be applied.
