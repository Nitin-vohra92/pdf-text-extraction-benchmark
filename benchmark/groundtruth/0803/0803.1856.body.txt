Strong law of large numbers with concave moments

Introduction

Let Ω be a standard probability space and L:Ω  →  Ω and ergodic measure-preserving transformation. Let [formula] be any measurable map and consider the Birkhoff sums [formula]. Recall that this ergodic (or "stationary") setting includes the case of the sums [formula] of a family {Xk}k of i.i.d. random variables.

Let [formula] be any concave function with D'(  ∞  ) = 0. If D(|f|) is integrable, then

[formula]

(i) For the notation D'(  ∞  ), recall that the derivative D' exists except possibly on a countable set and is non-increasing. Moreover, [formula]. (ii) The condition D'(  ∞  ) = 0 is not a restriction, since otherwise straightforward estimates reduce the question to Birkhoff's theorem and D(|Sn|) / n tends to [formula].

Playing with the choice of the arbitrary concave function D, one gets examples old and new. For instance, D(t) = tp yields a Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund theorem:

Let 0 < p < 1. If f∈Lp, then [formula].

Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund [\cite=Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund37] work in the i.i.d. case but with 0 < p < 2; however, when p > 1, no such statement can hold in the ergodic generality even under the strongest assumptions, see Proposition 2.2 in [\cite=Baxter-Jones-Lin-Olsen]. The independence condition was removed by S. Sawyer [\cite=Sawyer66]. The beautiful geometric proof by Ledrappier-Lim [\cite=Ledrappier-Lim] for p = 1 / 2 has inspired the present note.

Recall that f is log-integrable if log +|f|∈L1, where log +  =   max ( log ,0). The choice D(t) =  log (1 + t) yields:

If f is log-integrable, then [formula].

Observe that for functions [formula], concavity is preserved under composition. Combining this operation and shift of variables, one has further examples such as:

Let p > 0. If log +|f|∈Lp, then [formula].

Proofs

Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. Notice that D is non-decreasing and subadditive. We can assume D(0) = 0 upon adding a constant. We can assume that D tends to infinity since otherwise it is bounded. Thus, D(|x - y|) defines a proper invariant metric on the group [formula] and Sn is the random walk associated to (Ω,L). Recall that a horofunction h (normalized by h(0) = 0) is any limit point in the topology of compact convergence of the family D(|t - x|)  -  D(|t|) of functions of x indexed by t. According to [\cite=Karlsson-Ledrappier06], there are horofunctions hω on [formula] such that

[formula]

However, D'(  ∞  ) = 0 implies that h = 0 is the only horofunction since

[formula]

Corollary [\ref=cor:log_p]. For any p > 0 there is x0 such that D(t) = ( log (x + x0))p is concave on [formula]. Now D(|f|) is integrable and the statement follows.

Comments and references

(i) We used only a very special case of the LLN of [\cite=Karlsson-Ledrappier06], which applies to group-valued random variables. Theorem [\ref=thm:main] holds indeed also in that setting with identical proof, but can immediately be reduced to the real-valued case.

(ii) The point of the present note is that the LLN of [\cite=Karlsson-Ledrappier06] brings new insights even when the group is the range [formula] of classical random variables, since we can endow it with various invariant metrics. There is indeed a wealth of such metrics; recall that even [formula] admits an invariant metric whose completion is Urysohn's universal polish space [\cite=Urysohn27] (by Theorem 4 in [\cite=Cameron-Vershik]). Wild proper metrics can be constructed by means of weighted infinite generating sets.

(iii) One can relax the concavity assumption is various ways. For instance, keeping D(t) / t  →  0, it suffices to assume that D is quasi-concave in the sense that Jensen's inequalities hold up to a multiplicative constant. Indeed, this implies that D can be constrained within two proportional concave functions [\cite=Mulholland32].
