Lower Bounds on the Minimum Pseudodistance for Linear Codes with q-ary PSK Modulation over AWGN

Introduction

Background

In classical coding theory, maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding of a signal-space code leads to a nearest-neighbour decision rule in the signal space. For this reason, the minimum Euclidean distance between modulated codewords (signal points) of a signal-space code is used as a first-order measure of its error-correcting performance under ML decoding. In the case of binary modulation, the minimum Hamming distance of the underlying code may be substituted, since in this case the Hamming distance is proportional to the squared Euclidean distance.

Recently, low-density parity check (LDPC) codes [\cite=Gallager] have attracted much interest due to their practical efficiency. In particular, it was shown that several families of LDPC codes can attain the capacity of various channels, when decoded by iterative message passing (MP) algorithms (for instance see [\cite=LMSS], [\cite=Shokrollahi], [\cite=Urbanke2]).

The MP decoding algorithm operates locally on the Tanner graph, a graph which represents the parity-check matrix. The notion of computation tree pseudocodewords was introduced in [\cite=Wiberg] in order to adequately explain the limitations of MP decoding of binary LDPC codes. Computation tree pseudocodewords are closely related to graph-cover pseudocodewords. The latter were extensively studied in [\cite=KV-characterization], [\cite=KV-IEEE-IT], [\cite=KV-Turbo] and [\cite=KV-lower-bounds]. The graph-cover pseudocodewords lie inside a region called the fundamental cone (see [\cite=KV-characterization], [\cite=KV-IEEE-IT]). The set of graph-cover pseudocodewords were shown to be equivalent to the set of linear-programming (LP) pseudocodewords for the cases of binary [\cite=Feldman-thesis], [\cite=Feldman] and nonbinary coded modulation systems [\cite=FSBG], [\cite=SFBG-2]. In both binary and nonbinary cases, necessary and sufficient conditions for codeword error under linear programming (LP) decoding could be expressed is terms of these LP pseudocodewords, assuming transmission of the all-zero codeword ([\cite=Feldman], [\cite=FSBG]).

In [\cite=FKKR], the pseudocodeword effective Euclidean distance, or pseudodistance, is associated with any pseudocodeword. This concept of pseudodistance was shown in [\cite=FKKR] to play an analagous role to that of the signal Euclidean distance in ML decoding. The minimum pseudodistance is defined as the minimum over all pseudodistances of pseudocodewords; this may be taken as a first-order measure of decoder error-correcting performance for LP or MP decoding. In [\cite=KV-lower-bounds], it was shown that bounds could be obtained on the minimum pseudoweight of a binary linear code, these bounds being expressed in terms of parameters of the parity-check matrix of the code.

In this work, we extend the results in [\cite=KV-lower-bounds] to the nonbinary case. In particular, we show that bounds on the minimum pseudodistance can be obtained for the case of nonbinary coding and modulation, which are generalizations of the bounds on pseudoweight in [\cite=KV-lower-bounds] for the case of binary coding and modulation. Generally, the techniques are based on the techniques therein, although some additional ideas are used.

Basic Definitions

We consider codes over finite rings (this includes codes over finite fields, but may be more general). Denote by [formula] a ring with q elements, by 0 its additive identity, and let [formula]. Let C be a linear

Bounds on the Pseudodistance of Individual Pseudocodewords

In [\cite=Feldman], for the case of binary coding and binary modulation, the set of pseudocodewords was used to characterize the error correction capability of the system under LP decoding. This was extended to the case of nonbinary coding and modulation in [\cite=FSBG]. In [\cite=FKKR], it was observed that with each pseudocodeword [formula] may be associated a point in the signal space; these signal points then play a role in LP decoding analagous to that of the modulated codewords in ML decoding. In particular, we may associate with each pseudocodeword an effective Euclidean distance from the modulated all-zero codeword, or pseudodistance, [formula] (pseudodistance with respect to the all-zero codeword is sufficient assuming the symmetry condition above). Then, assuming LP decoding, the event [formula] = "on transmission of the all-zero codeword, there is a codeword error due to pseudocodeword [formula]" has probability

[formula]

(where σ2 is the noise variance per dimension, and [formula] denotes the Gaussian Q-function) and thus the probability of codeword error is equal to [formula] where the union is over the set of all pseudocodewords [formula] (equation ([\ref=eq:Prob_of_CW_error_due_to_PCW]) was stated in [\cite=FKKR] for the case of MP decoding and computation tree pseudocodewords). Therefore the minimum pseudodistance [formula] may be taken as a first-order measure of error-correcting performance of the coded modulation system. For the case of MP decoding and graph-cover pseudocodewords, ([\ref=eq:Prob_of_CW_error_due_to_PCW]) may be taken as an approximation. Also, for the case of binary coding and modulation, the pseudocodeword effective Hamming weight (or "pseudoweight") may be defined by [formula] by analogy with the case of classical ML decoding [\cite=FKKR].

It was shown in [\cite=Kelley-Sridhara-ISIT-2006] that for the case of q-ary PSK modulation over AWGN, the squared pseudodistance between the all-zero codeword and the pseudocodeword [formula] is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

By rearrangement of the expression in ([\ref=eq:M]), we have

[formula]

Similarly, for ([\ref=eq:V]) we have

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

After rearrangement, we obtain

[formula]

We substitute the expressions in ([\ref=eq:M-q]) and ([\ref=eq:V-q]) into ([\ref=eq:w-q-awgn]), and obtain that

[formula]

where

[formula]

Take [formula] with binary signaling over AWGN. In this case, q = 2, and ([\ref=eq:w-q]) can be re-written as

[formula]

which accords with the well-known pseudoweight expression for the case of binary code and modulation [\cite=KV-characterization].

Take [formula] with ternary PSK modulation over AWGN. We show that in this case the inequality ([\ref=eq:w-q]) can be slightly improved. Observe that in this case, ([\ref=eq:M]) and ([\ref=eq:V]) can be re-written as

[formula]

and

[formula]

where the last equality in ([\ref=eq:M-3]) and the equality in ([\ref=eq:V-3]) are due to the fact that [formula] for all i∈I.

Finally, we substitute the expressions in ([\ref=eq:M-3]) and ([\ref=eq:V-3]) into ([\ref=eq:w-q-awgn]) to obtain that

[formula]

Take [formula] with quaternary PSK (QPSK) modulation over AWGN channel. In this case, using ([\ref=eq:w-q]), we obtain that

Inequalities for Pseudocodewords

A complete characterization of the fundamental cone, in which the pseudocodewords lie, was given for the case of binary coding and modulation in [\cite=KV-characterization]. For the present more general framework, a complete characterization of the corresponding fundamental region appears to be a difficult task. In this section we derive a set of inequalities which must be satisfied by the entries of any pseudocodeword matrix; these inequalities must necessarily be satisfied by any pseudocodeword lying in the fundamental cone. These inequalities will be helpful in deriving the bounds on minimum pseudodistance in the sequel.

Let C be a linear

[formula]

Suppose the graph-cover pseudocodeword [formula] corresponds to the M-cover   =  (,), and let [formula] be the linear code of length Mn over [formula] defined by the parity-check matrix [formula] described by ([\ref=eq:H-tilde]). Then, [formula] is the Tanner graph of the code [formula] associated with the parity-check matrix [formula].

Take some j∈J and [formula]. Fix some 1  ≤  j*  ≤  M, and take the j*-th copy vj,j*∈ of the parity-check vertex vj∈V. Let

[formula]

where 1  ≤  σ(i,j*)  ≤  M for every i∈Ij.

Denote j'  =  (j - 1)M  +  j*. Since [formula],

[formula]

This can be rewritten as

[formula]

Assume that [formula]. Then,

[formula]

and, since [formula] is not a zero divisor in [formula], the expression in ([\ref=eq:non-zero]) is non-zero. Therefore, there exists at least one ij*∈Ij, [formula], such that

[formula]

The number of indices j* (1  ≤  j*  ≤  M) such that [formula] is given by [formula]. This number is equal to the number of indices j* (1  ≤  j*  ≤  M) such that pij*,σ(ij*,j*)  ≠  0, which, in turn, is less than or equal to

[formula]

On division of both sides of ([\ref=eq:thrm-ineq]) by M, we obtain the following result.

Let C, H and P be defined as in Theorem [\ref=thrm:simple-inequality]. Then, for any j∈J, [formula],

[formula]

Eigenvalue Bound

In this section, we consider (c,d)-regular codes, i.e. the parity check matrix H of C has c nonzero elements per column and d nonzero elements per row. Throughout this section, let C be a (c,d)-regular linear

[formula]

Linear-Programming Bound

In this section, we present the linear-programming lower bound on the minimum pseudodistance, similar to its counterpart in [\cite=KV-lower-bounds]. Throughout this section, let C be a linear
