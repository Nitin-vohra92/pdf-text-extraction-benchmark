SN 2005kd was discovered by T.Puckett and A.Pelloni with 0.35-m automated supernova patrol telescope on November 12.22 UT at magnitude 17.0, while on November 9 the object was not detected (fainter than 20 mag). It is located at [formula] (2000.0), which is [formula] west and [formula] north from the center of Sc galaxy PGC 14370 (Puckett, Pelloni, 2005).

SN 2005kd has been found by an Ohio State University group (Prieto, 2005) to be a young type-IIn supernova from a spectrogram (range 390-730 nm) taken on November 13.3 UT with the MDM 2.4-m telescope; the spectrum shows a blue continuum and strong hydrogen Balmer and He I lines in emission.

We started photometric observations of SN 2005kd immediately after discovery, on 2005 November 13, and continued until 2007 April 16. Observations were carried out with the following telescopes and CCD cameras: 60-cm reflector of Crimean Observatory of Sternberg Astronomical Institute (C60) equipped with Apogee AP-47p camera; 50/70-cm meniscus telescope of Crimean Observatory (C50) with Meade Pictor 416XT camera; 70-cm reflector in Moscow (M70) with Apogee AP-47p (a) or AP-7p (b) cameras.

The color terms for C60 and M70 were reported by Tsvetkov et al. (2006). The observations at C50 were carried out only with V filter which was close to standard system, and no correction was applied.

All image reductions and photometry were made using IRAF. The position of SN 2005kd is quite close to the center of the host galaxy, and the subtraction of galaxy background is necessary for reliable photometry. The template images were constructed from frames obtained on 2007 August 8 and 2007 September 25, when SN was no longer visible. After template subtraction the magnitudes of SN were derived by PSF fitting relative to a sequence of local standard stars. The image of SN 2005kd with local standard stars is shown in Figure 1, and the magnitudes of these stars are reported in Table 1.

The observations of SN 2005kd are presented in Table 2, and the light curves are shown in Figure 2. Some unfiltered CCD magnitudes were reported at IAU Circulars and at SNWeb, they are also plotted in Figure 2. The data shows that SN 2005kd was discovered immediately after explosion, and our first two observations were on the rising branch of the light curve. The rate of brightness increase is about 0.3-0.4 mag day- 1 in all bands. The outburst most likely occurred on 2005 November 10 or 11, and we accept JD 2453685 as the date of explosion. Unfortunately, we missed the most interesting part of the light curve and cannot reliably establish the shape of the light curve peak and the maximum luminosity. Our next observation was only on 2006 January 3, and on this date SN was brightest of all our data set. The magnitudes from SNWeb allow to suggest quite flat maximum, but they also have a large gap. After small drop from the maximum the SN entered a plateau stage, which lasted for at least 192 days, from day 119 until day 311 past explosion. Another gap in observations does not allow to determine the length of the plateau more definitely. Since 2005 September 17 (day 341) until the end of our observations at day 522 the SN is gradually fading, but at different rates. Until day 405 the decline is slow, with rates 0.0077 mag day- 1 in R and I bands, 0.0087 mag day- 1 in V and 0.013 mag day- 1 in B. The late decline is about two times faster: 0.017 mag day- 1 in R and I bands, 0.025 mag day- 1 in B and V.

The color curves are presented in Figure 3. (V - R) color is gradually increasing, (R - I) remains nearly constant after initial increase, while (B - V) reaches maximum on the plateau and then slightly decreases.

If we take for PGC 14370 distance modulus Î¼ = 34.07 and Galactic extinction AV = 0.87 from NED, then the absolute magnitude on 2006 January 3 (day 54) is MV =  - 19.84. The real maximum luminosity can be significantly higher, because we missed the peak of the light curve and do not know the extinction in the host galaxy.

The absolute V light curve of SN 2005kd is shown in Figure 4 and compared to the light curves of well-studied slowly declining type IIn SNe: 1997cy (Germany et al., 2000), 1999E (Rigon et al., 2003), 1995G (Pastorello et al., 2002), 1988Z (Turatto et al., 1993). The similarity of overall photometric evolution of SNe 2005kd and 1997cy is evident, although the differences are also noticeable. We note that for both SNe the rate of brightness decline changed at about the same phase, close to day 400. SN 1999E is fainter, but the shape of the light curve is the same as for SN 1997cy; SNe 1988Z and 1995G are much fainter and have different light curves. The plateau of SN 2005kd is the unique feature for SNeIIn, nothing similar can be seen on all other light curves.

The (B - V)0 color curves for these SNe are compared in Figure 5. SNe 1997cy, 1999E and 1999G have similar color evolution, after initial reddening (B - V) color remains nearly constant, at about 0.5-0.6 mag. SNe 2005kd and 1988Z are certainly bluer, and at the phases greater then 300 days SN 2005kd is the bluest among these objects.

We can roughly estimate the lower limit to the energy radiated by SN 2005kd in UBVRI bands during first 500 days of evolution. Assuming the distance and extinction reported earlier and using simple linear interpolations in the gaps, we obtain [formula] ergs.

SN 2005kd is among the most luminous SNe ever observed. As for other SNe IIn, its high energy release is likely due to the interaction of ejecta with a dense circumstellar medium. For all well-studied SNe IIn the brightness decline was slow but gradual, without periods of constant luminosity. The plateau lasting at least 192 days observed for SN 2005kd is a unique feature for SNe IIn. Unfortunately, the gaps in our data does not allow to trace the peak of the light curve and the end of plateau.
