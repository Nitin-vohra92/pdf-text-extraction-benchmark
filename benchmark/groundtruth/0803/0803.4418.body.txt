Introduction

We say that a graph is K3,3-minor-free if it does not contain the complete bipartite graph K3,3 as a minor. In this paper we are interested in the number of simple labelled K3,3-minor-free and maximal K3,3-minor-free graphs, where maximal means that adding any edge to such a graph yields a K3,3-minor. It is known that there exists a constant c, such that there are at most cnn! K3,3-minor-free graphs on n vertices. This follows from a result of Norine et al. [\cite=nstw06], which prove such a bound for all proper graph classes closed under taking minors. This gives also an upper bound on the number of maximal K3,3-minor-free graphs as they are a proper subclass of K3,3-minor-free graphs.

In [\cite=msw05b], McDiarmid, Steger and Welsh give conditions where an upper bound of the form cnn! on the number of graphs |Cn| on n vertices in graph class C yields that [formula] as n  →    ∞  . These conditions are satisfied for K3,3-minor-free graphs, but not in the case of maximal K3,3-minor-free graphs as one condition requires that two disjoint copies of a graph of the class in question form again a graph of the class.

Thus we know that there exists a growth constant c for K3,3-minor-free graphs, but not its exact value. For maximal K3,3-minor-free graphs we only have an upper bound. Lower bounds on the number of graphs in our classes can be obtained by considering (maximal) planar graphs. Due to Kuratowski's theorem [\cite=k30] planar graphs are K3,3- and K5-minor-free. Hence, the class of (maximal) planar graphs is contained in the class of maximal K3,3-minor-free graphs and we can use the number of planar graphs and the number of triangulations as lower bounds. Determining the number (of graphs of sub-classes) of planar graphs has attracted considerable attention [\cite=bgw02] [\cite=gn05] [\cite=bgkn05] [\cite=blmk06] in recent years. Giménez and Noy [\cite=gn05] obtained precise asymptotic estimates for the number of planar graphs. Already in 1962, the asymptotic number of triangulations was given by Tutte [\cite=t62]. Investigating how much the number of planar graphs (triangulations) differs from (maximal) K3,3-minor-free graphs was also a main motivation for our research.

In this paper we derive precise asymptotic estimates for the number of simple labelled K3,3-minor-free and maximal K3,3-minor-free graphs on n vertices, and we establish several limit laws for parameters in random K3,3-minor-free graphs. More precisely, we show that the number gn, cn, and bn of not necessarily connected, connected and 2-connected K3,3-minor-free graphs on n vertices, and the number mn of maximal K3,3-minor-free graphs on n vertices satisfy

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula], [formula], and [formula] are analytically computable constants. Moreover, we derive limit laws for K3,3-minor-free graphs, for instance we show that the number of edges is asymptotically normally distributed with mean κn and variance λn, where [formula] and [formula] are analytically computable constants. Thus the expected number of edges is only slightly larger than for planar graphs [\cite=gn05].

To establish these results for K3,3-minor-free graphs, we follow the approach taken for planar graphs [\cite=bgw02] [\cite=gn05]: we use a well-known decomposition along the connectivity structure of a graph, i.e. into connected, 2-connected and 3-connected components, and translate this decomposition into relations of our generating functions. This is possible as the decomposition for K3,3-minor-free graphs which is due to Wagner [\cite=w37] fits well into this framework. Then we use singularity analysis to obtain asymptotic estimates and limit laws for several parameters from these equations.

For maximal K3,3-minor-free graphs the situation is quite different, as the decomposition which is again due to Wagner has further constraints (it restricts which edges can be used to merge two graphs into a new one). The functional equations for the generating functions of edge-rooted maximal graphs are easy to obtain but in order to go to unrooted graphs, special integration techniques based on rational parametrization of rational curves are needed. This is the most innovative part of the paper with respect to previous work, specially with respect to the techniques developed in [\cite=gn05]. As a result, we can derive equations for the generating functions which involve the generating function for triangulations derived by Tutte [\cite=t62], and deduce precise asymptotic estiamates.

In the subsequent sections, we proceed as follows. First, we turn to maximal K3,3-minor-free and K3,3-minor-free graphs in Sections [\ref=sec:MaximalK33MinorFree] and [\ref=sec:K33MinorFree] respectively. In each of these sections, we will first derive relations for the generating functions based on a decomposition of the considered graph class and then apply singularity analysis to obtain asymptotic estimates for the number (and properties) of the graphs in these classes. The last section contains the enumeration of graphs not containing K+3,3 as a minor, where K+3,3 is the graph obtained from K3,3 by adding an edge.

Throughout the paper variable x marks vertices and variable y marks edges. Unless we specify the contrary, the graphs we consider are labelled and the corresponding generating functions are exponential. We often need to distinguish an atom of our combinatorial objects; for instance we want to mark a vertex in a graph as a root vertex. For the associated generating function this means taking the derivative with respect to the corresponding variable and multiplying the result by this variable. To simplify the formulas, we use the following notation. Let G(x,y) and G(x) be generating functions, then we abbreviate [formula] and [formula]. Additionally, we use the following standard notation: for a graph G we denote by V(G) and E(G) the vertex- and edge-set of G.

Maximal K3,3-minor-free graphs

Already in the 1930s, Wagner [\cite=w37] described precisely the structure of maximal K3,3-minor-free graphs. Roughly speaking his theorem states that a maximal graph not containing K3,3 as a minor is formed by gluing planar triangulations and the exceptional graph K5 along edges, in such a way that no two different triangulations are glued along an edge. Before we state the theorem more precisely, we introduce the following notation (similar to [\cite=t99], see also Section [\ref=sec:Decomposition]).

Let G1 and G2 be graphs with disjoint vertex-sets, where each edge is either colored blue or red. Let e1  =  (a,b)∈E(G1) and e2  =  (c,d)∈E(G2) be an edge of G1 and G2 respectively. For i = 1,2 let Gi' be obtained by deleting edge e1 and coloring edge e2 blue if e1 and e2 were both colored blue and red otherwise. Let G be the graph obtained from the union of G1' and G2' by identifying vertices a and b by c and d respectively. Then we say that G is a strict 2-sum of G1 and G2. We say that a strict 2-sum is proper if at least one of the edges e1 and e2 is blue.

Let T denote the set of all labeled planar triangulations where each edge is colored red. Let each edge of the complete graph K5 be colored blue. A graph is maximal K3,3-minor-free if and only if it can be obtained from planar triangulations and K5 by proper, strict 2-sums.

Let A be the family of maximal graphs not containing K3,3 as a minor. Let H be the family of edge-rooted graphs in A, where the root belongs to a triangulation, and let F be edge-rooted graphs in A, where the root does not belong to a triangulation.

Let T0(x,y) be the generating function (GF for short) of edge-rooted planar triangulations (the root-edge is included), and let K0(x,y) be the GF of edge-rooted K5 (the root-edge is not included). Let A(x,y),F(x,y),H(x,y) be the GFs associated respectively to the families A,F,H. In all cases the two endpoints of the root edge do not bear labels, and the root edge is oriented; this amounts to multiplying the corresponding GF by 2 / x2. Notice that

[formula]

Since edge-rooted graphs from A are the disjoint union of H and F, we have

[formula]

The fundamental equations that we need are the following:

[formula]

The first equation means that a graph in H is obtained by substituting every edge in a planar triangulation by an edge-rooted graph whose root does not belong to a triangulation (because of the statement of Wagner's theorem). The second equation means that a graph in F is obtained by taking (an unordered) set of K5's in which each edge is substituted by an edge-rooted graph either in H or in F.

Eliminating H we get the equation

[formula]

Hence, for fixed x,

[formula]

is the functional inverse of F(x,y).

In order to analyze F using Equation ([\ref=F]) we need to know the series T0(x,y) in detail. Let Tn be the number of (labeled) planar triangulations with n vertices. Since a triangulation has exactly 3n - 6 edges, we see that

[formula]

is the GF of triangulations. And since

[formula]

it is enough to study T.

Let now tn be the number of rooted (unlabeled) triangulations with n vertices in the sense of Tutte and let [formula] be the corresponding ordinary GF. We know (see [\cite=t62]) that t(x) is equal to

[formula]

where θ(x) is the algebraic function defined by

[formula]

It is known that the dominant singularity of θ is at R = 27 / 256 and θ(R)  =  1 / 4.

There is a direct relation between the numbers Tn and tn. An unlabeled rooted triangulation can be labeled in n! ways, and a labeled triangulation ([formula]) can be rooted in 4(3n - 6) ways, since we have 3n - 6 possibilities for choosing the root edge, two for orienting the edge, and two for choosing the root face. Hence we have

[formula]

The former identity implies easily the following equation connecting the exponential GF T(x,y) and the ordinary GF t(x):

[formula]

Hence we have

[formula]

The last equation is crucial since it expresses T0 in terms of a known algebraic function. It is convenient to rewrite it as

[formula]

The series L(x,y) is defined through the algebraic equation

[formula]

This defines a rational curve, i.e. a curve of genus zero, in the variables L and y (here x is taken as a parameter) and admits the rational (actually polynomial) parametrization

[formula]

This is a key fact that we use later.

We have set up the preliminaries needed in order to analyze the series A(x,y), which is the main goal of this section. From ([\ref=root]) it follows that

[formula]

The following lemma expresses A(x,y) directly in terms of H and F without integrals.

The generating function A(x,y) of maximal graphs not containing K3,3 as a minor can be expressed as

[formula]

where L = L(x,F(x,y)), H = H(x,y) and F = F(x,y) are defined through ([\ref=L]), ([\ref=H]) and ([\ref=F]).

Integration by parts gives

[formula]

where

[formula]

and derivatives are with respect to the second variable. Because of ([\ref=inverse]), the change of variable s = F(x,t) gives t = ψ(s) and

[formula]

Since H = T0(x,F) we have H' = T0'(x,F)F' and so

[formula]

where the last equality follows from Equation ([\ref=F]).

It remains to compute the last integral. From ([\ref=t0]) it follows easily that

[formula]

Now we change variables according to ([\ref=parametric]) taking s  =  ξ(t), so that L = λ(t). Let ζ be the inverse function of ξ, so that t  =  ζ(s). Observe that ζ(s) satisfies

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

After substituting the expressions for ξ(t) and λ(t), the integrand in the last integral is equal to

[formula]

The function f(x,t) can be integrated in elementary terms, resulting in

[formula]

where ζ  =  ζ(F). All terms with ζ are powers of either of the two forms

[formula]

so we can write the integral of f(x,t) explicitly in terms of F and L = L(x,F),

[formula]

We simplify this expression further using that, according to Equations ([\ref=H]), ([\ref=t0]) and ([\ref=L]),

[formula]

Obtaining the final expression for A(x,y) is just a matter of going back to Equation ([\ref=eq:beginninglemma]) and adding up all terms.

Summarizing, we have an explicit expression for A in terms of x, y, H(x,y) and F(x,y) which involves only elementary functions and the algebraic function L(x,y). Moreover, note that H(x,y) can be written in terms of L(x,F) by Equation ([\ref=H_LF]). Our goal is to carry out a full singularity analysis of the univariate GF A(x)  =  A(x,1). To this end we first perform singularity analysis on F(x)  =  F(x,1).

The dominant singularity of F(x) is the unique ρ > 0 such that ρF(ρ)3  =  27 / 256. The approximate value is ρ  ≈  0.10530385. The value F(ρ)  ≈  1.0005216 is the solution of

[formula]

The function F(x) satisfies

[formula]

Thus the dominant singularity ρ of F(x) may come from T0 or from a branch point when solving ([\ref=phi]). Assume that there is no such branch point. Then, since L(x,y) = θ(xy3) and the dominant singularity of θ is at 27 / 256, we have that L(ρ,F(ρ)) = 1 / 4 and ρF(ρ)3 = 27 / 256. Substituting in Φ(x,F) = 0 we obtain Equation ([\ref=eq:F0]), where t stands for F(ρ). The approximate value is t  ≈  1.0005216, which gives ρ  ≈  0.10530385, slightly smaller than R = 27 / 256 = 0.10546875.

We now prove that there is no branch point when solving Φ. If this were the case, then there would exist   ≤  ρ such that ∂FΦ(,F()) = 0, where

[formula]

follows by differentiating Equation ([\ref=phi]), by using Φ(x,F(x)) = 0 and Equations ([\ref=L]), ([\ref=T0p]), and ([\ref=H_LF]).

Consider ∂FΦ(x,F,L) as a function of three independent variables, where x  ≥  0, F  ≥  1 and 0  ≤  L  ≤  1 / 4. It follows easily that it is an increasing function on any of them. Hence

[formula]

since, by assumption,   ≤  ρ. On the other hand ∂FΦ(ρ,t,1 / 4)  ≈   - 0.9939, so by comparing this with ∂FΦ(ρ,F(),1 / 4) we deduce that t < F(). Since 1 = F(0) < t, by continuity of F(x) there exists a value x∈(0,) such that F(x) = t, and by the monotonicity of Φ(x,F) for fixed F there is a unique solution x to Φ(x,t) = 0. This solution is precisely x = ρ, contradicting   ≤  ρ.

Let ρ and t be as in Lemma [\ref=lemma-F]. The singular expansions of F(x) at ρ is

[formula]

where [formula], and F2 and F3 are given by

[formula]

[formula]

To obtain the coefficients of the singularity expansion, including the fact that F1 = 0, we apply indeterminate coefficients Fi, Li of Xi to Equations ([\ref=phi]) and

[formula]

where [formula], so that x = ρ(1 - X2). These calculations are tedious, but can be done with a computer algebra system such as Maple.

Let ρ and t be as in Lemma [\ref=lemma-F]. The dominant singularity of A(x) is ρ, and its singular expansion at ρ is

[formula]

where [formula] and A0, A2, A4 and A5 are given by

[formula]

where C = 35 / 225, and M and Q are as in Proposition [\ref=prop-F].

We just compute the singular expansion

[formula]

by plugging the expansions for F(x) and L(x) of Proposition [\ref=lemma-F] in ([\ref=explicit]).

The number An of maximal graphs with n vertices not containing K3,3 as a minor is asymptotically

[formula]

where γ  =  1 / ρ  ≈  9.49629 and a =  - 15A5 / 8π≃0.25354  ·  10- 3.

This is a standard application of singularity analysis (see for example Corollary VI.1 of [\cite=fs05]) to the singular expansion of A(x) obtained in the previous lemma.

K3,3-minor-free graphs

In this section, we derive the asymptotic number of K3,3-minor-free graphs and properties of random K3,3-minor-free graphs.

Decomposition and Generating Functions

Let G(x,y), C(x,y) and B(x,y) denote the exponential generating functions of simple labelled not necessarily connected, connected and 2-connected K3,3-minor-free graphs respectively. We will use the additional variable q to mark the number of K5's used in the "construction process" of a K3,3-minor-free graph (see below for a more precise explanation), but we won't give it explicitly in the argument list of our generating functions to simplify expressions.

We want to apply singularity analysis to derive asymptotic estimates for the number of K3,3-minor-free graphs. To achieve this, we first present a decomposition of this graph class which is due to Wagner [\cite=w37]. Then we will translate it into relations of our generating functions.

As seen in Theorem [\ref=thm:wagner] above, Wagner [\cite=w37] characterized the class of maximal K3,3-minor-free graphs. As a direct consequence we also obtain a decomposition for K3,3-minor-free graphs. We will present here a more recent formulation of it, given by Thomas, Theorem 1.2 of [\cite=t99]. Roughly speaking the theorem states that a graph has no minor isomorphic to K3,3 if and only if it can be obtained from a planar graph or K5 by merging on an edge, a vertex, or taking disjoint components. To state the theorem more precisely, we need the following definition of [\cite=t99].

Let G1 and G2 be graphs with disjoint vertex-sets, let k  ≥  0 be an integer, and for i = 1,2 let Xi  ⊆  V(Gi) be a set of pairwise adjacent vertices of size k. For i = 1,2 let Gi' be obtained by deleting some (possibly none) edges with both ends in Xi. Let f:X1  →  X2 be a bijection, and let G be the graph obtained from the union of G1' and G2' by identifying x with f(x) for all x∈X1. In those circumstances we say that G is a k-sum of G1 and G2.

Now, we can state the theorem as a consequence of Wagner's theorem in the following way.

A graph has no minor isomorphic to K3,3 if and only if it can be obtained from planar graphs and K5 by means of 0-, 1-, and 2-sums.

Observe that for 2-connected K3,3-minor-free graphs we only have to take 2-sums into account as 0- and 1-sums do not yield a 2-connected graph. In this way the decomposition of Wagner fits perfectly well into a result of Walsh [\cite=w82] which delivers us - similarly to the case of planar graphs (see [\cite=bgw02]) - with the necessary relations for our generating functions.

The second ingredient for obtaining relations for our generating functions is to use a well-known decomposition of a graph along its connectivity-structure, i.e. into connected, 2-connected, and 3-connected components. Eventually, we obtain the following Lemma.

Let G(x,y), C(x,y) and B(x,y) denote the bivariate exponential generating functions for not necessarily connected, connected and 2-connected K3,3-minor-free graphs. Then we have

[formula]

Moreover, let M(x,y) denote the bivariate generating function for 3-connected planar maps which satisfies

[formula]

where U(x,y) and V(x,y) are algebraic functions given by

[formula]

then we have

[formula]

where D(x,y) is defined implicitly by D(x,0)  =  0 and

[formula]

where q marks the monomial for K5.

Equations ([\ref=eqn:GeneralConnectivity]) are standard and encode that a not necessarily connected graph consists of a set of connected graphs and a connected graph can be decomposed at a vertex into a set of 2-connected graphs whose vertices can again be replaced by rooted connected graphs. For more detailed proofs see for example [\cite=fs05](p.95) and [\cite=hp73](p.10).

Using Euler's polyhedral formula, Equations ([\ref=eqn:PlanarMaps]) and ([\ref=eqn:PlanarMapsUV]) follow from [\cite=ms68], where Mullin and Schellenberg derived the generating function for rooted 3-connected planar maps according to the number of vertices and faces.

Next, to derive the connection between 2-connected and 3-connected graphs, we can use a result of Walsh. More precisely, by Proposition 1.2 of [\cite=w82] we obtain Equations ([\ref=eqn:2connectedDeriv]) and ([\ref=eqn:3connected]), where we have to add only a monomial for K5 compared to the class of planar graphs. For more details we refer to [\cite=bgw02].

Singular Expansions and Asymptotic Estimates

We use the relations of the generating functions obtained so far to derive singular expansions for the generating functions of the different connectivity levels. We start from 3-connected K3,3-minor-free graphs and then go up the connectivity hierarchy level by level. Eventually, this will allow us to derive asymptotic estimates for the number of and properties of not necessarily connected K3,3-minor-free graphs in the subsequent sections.

We start with 3-connected K3,3-minor-free graphs. We have to introduce only a slight modification into the formulas already known for planar graphs ([\cite=bgw02] [\cite=gn05]).

From Lemma [\ref=lem:DecompositionConnectivityK33] we can derive analogously to [\cite=bgw02] a singular expansion for D(x,y). It will turn out that the singularity of D(x,y) changes only slightly compared to the case of 2-connected planar graphs, but yields a larger exponential growth rate.

To simplify expressions, we will use the following notation. The equation Y(t)  =  y has a unique solution in t  =  t(y) in a suitable small neighbourhood of 1. Then we denote by R(y)  =  ζ(t(y)). See Appendix [\ref=sec:AppendixA] for expressions for Y(t) and ζ.

For fixed y in a small neighbourhood of 1, R(y) is the unique dominant singularity of D(x,y). Moreover, D(x,y) has a branch-point at R(y), and the singular expansion at R(y) is of the form

[formula]

where [formula] and the Di(y), [formula] are given in Appendix [\ref=sec:AppendixA].

To prove this lemma, one can mimic the proof of Lemma 3 in [\cite=bgw02]. Although we slightly changed the equations by adding a monomial for K5, one can check that the same arguments still hold.

Next, we solve Equation ([\ref=eqn:2connectedDeriv]) for B(x,y) by integrating according to y. We omit the proof as it follows closely the lines of proof of Lemma 5 in [\cite=gn05].

Let W(x,z)  =  z(1  +  U(x,z)). The generating function B(x,y) of 2-connected K3,3-minor-free graphs admits the following expression as a formal power series:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

We can use this lemma to obtain the singular expansion for B(x,y).

For fixed y in a small neighbourhood of 1, the dominant singularity of B(x,y) is equal to R(y). The singular expansion at R(y) is of the form

[formula]

where [formula], and the Bi(y), [formula] are analytic functions in a neighbourhood of 1.

From Equation ([\ref=eqn:2connected]) we can see that for y close to 1 the only singularities come from the singularities of D(x,y); hence the first claim of the theorem follows.

The singular expansion for B(x,y) can be obtained using Equation ([\ref=eqn:2connected]) and the singular expansion for D(x,y). We substitute the singular expansion for D(x,y), U(x,D(x,y)) in ([\ref=eqn:2connected]). Then we set x  =  ζ(t)(1  -  X2) and y  =  Y(t) and expand the resulting expression. Now, collecting and simplifying the coefficients of the Xi for [formula] is a tedious calculation, but can be done with a computer algebra system such as Maple. This yields the expressions for the Bi(y) given in the appendix.

For connected and not necessarily connected K3,3-minor-free graphs, we can derive singular expansions by carrying out an analogous calculation as in the proof of Theorem 1 in [\cite=gn05]. We only have to adapt for the different Di(y) and Bi(y). One can easily check that the intermediate step of Claim 1 in [\cite=gn05] still holds and the rest of the calculations stays the same. The coefficients of the expansions, which we obtain in this way, can be found in Appendix [\ref=sec:AppendixA].

For fixed y in a small neighbourhood of 1, the dominant singularity of C(x,y) and G(x,y) is equal to ρ(y). The singular expansions at ρ(y) are of the form

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula], and the Ci(y) and Gi(y), [formula], are analytic functions in a neighbourhood of 1.

From Lemmas [\ref=lem:2connectedExpansion] and [\ref=lem:connectedAndGeneralExpansion] we obtain the following asymptotic estimates using the "transfer theorem", Corollary VI.1 of [\cite=fs05].

Let gn, cn, and bn denote the number of not necessarily connected, connected and 2-connected resp. K3,3-minor-free graphs on n vertices. Then it holds

[formula]

where and [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula] are analytically computable constants.

Structural Properties

If we consider a random K3,3-minor-free graph, i.e. drawing a K3,3-minor-free graph on n vertices uniformly at random from all such graphs on n vertices, we can derive the following properties using the algebraic singularity schema (Theorem IX.10) of [\cite=fs05].

The number of edges in a not necessarily connected and connected random K3,3-minor-free graph is asymptotically normally distributed with mean μn and variance σ2n, which satisfy

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are analytically computable constants.

Recall that we introduced the variable q in the equations of the generating functions above to mark the monomial for K5. We can use this variable to obtain a limit law for the number of K5 used in the construction process (following the above decomposition, see Theorem [\ref=thm:Decomposition]) of a random K3,3-minor-free graph. The next theorem shows that a linear number of K5 is used, but the constant is very small; this is exactly what one would expect as the expected number of edges is only slightly larger than for planar graphs (see Theorem [\ref=thm:ExpectedNumEdges] and [\cite=gn05]).

Let [formula] denote the number of K5 used in the construction of a random K3,3-minor-free graph G according to Theorem [\ref=thm:Decomposition]. Then [formula] is asymptotically normally distributed with mean μn and variance σ2n, which satisfy

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are analytically computable constants. The same holds for a random connected K3,3-minor-free graph.

Graphs not containing K+3,3 as a minor

In this brief section we give estimates for the number of graphs not containing K+3,3 (the graph obtained from K3,3 by adding one edge) as a minor. For this we use the following recent result from [\cite=k33plus].

A 3-connected graphs not containing K+3,3 as a minor is either planar or isomorphic to K3,3 or K5.

The analogous to Lemma [\ref=Bgf] holds, that is we get B(x,y) with an additional term (now we set q = 1)

[formula]

This is because K3,3 has 6 vertices, 9 edges, and 10 different labellings. The equation for D(x,y) in Lemma [\ref=lem:DecompositionConnectivityK33] has to be modified too in order to take into account K3,3, and one has to add a term (again we set q = 1) x4D8 / 4.

There is a corresponding expression for the singular coefficients Bi at the dominant singularity R(y), which we do not write down in detail in order to avoid repetition. We obtain the dominant singularity ρ(y) for the generating functions C(x,y) and G(x,y), compute the corresponding singular expansions and obtain the following result.

Let gn, cn, and bn denote the number of not necessarily connected, connected and 2-connected resp. K+3,3-minor-free graphs on n vertices. Then it holds

[formula]

where [formula], and [formula] are analytically computable constants.

Here is a table showing the approximate values of the growth constants for planar, K3,3-minor-free and K+3,3-minor-free graphs.

It is natural to ask if one can go further and treat the case where the forbidden minor is obtained from K3,3 by adding two edges. If the two edges share a vertex, then the resulting graph is K1,2,3; if the two edges do not share a vertex, let us denote denote by L the resulting graph.

Enumeration when we forbid K1,2,3 is in principle feasible along the previous lines because of the following theorem due to Halin [\cite=halin] (see also [\cite=diestel]). The Wagner graph W consists of a cycle of length 8 in which opposite vertices are adjacent.

A 3-connected graph not containing K1,2,3 as a minor is either planar or isomorphic to K5,W,L or to nine sporadic non-planar graphs, or to a 3-connected subgraph of these.

This means that the generating function for 3-connected graphs not containing K1,2,3 as a minor is obtained by adding a finite number of monomials to the generating function of 3-connected planar graphs, which is already known to us, exactly as in the previous section. However performing all the computations corresponding to this case means: first to get the full list of exceptional 3-connected graphs up to isomorphism from the previous theorem, and in each case to compute the automorphism group in order to determine the number of different labellings in each case; and then to compute the singular expansions of all the generating functions involved. We have refrained from doing these computations, which would be along the same lines as before but likely very cumbersome.

However, forbidding L as a minor is another story and definitely we cannot solve this problem at this stage. The reason is that in this case one needs to take 3-sums (gluing along triangles) of graphs in order to describe the family of 3-connected graphs not containing L as a minor [\cite=diestel], and we do not have the necessary machinery to translate it into equations satisfied by the generating functions. This problem already appears if we try to count graphs not containing K5 as a minor (notice that L contains K5 as a proper minor). We believe this is a fascinating open problem that, if solved, will no doubt require new ideas and techniques.

The authors want to thank Eric Fusy and Konstantinos Panagiotou for many helpful discussions and for proofreading earlier versions of this manuscript.

Appendix

Here, we give the expressions for the coefficients of the singular expansions of D(x,y), U(x,y), B(x,y), C(x,y) and G(x,y) as well as the expressions for the singularities. We use the same approach as in [\cite=bgw02] and parametrize the expressions in the complex variable t.

The variable q used for counting the number of K5 appears explicitly only in the expression for h; the reason is that this is the only place where it is needed for computing the radius of convergence, which in turn is needed for estimating the expected value and variance in Theorem [\ref=thm:ExpectedNumK5s].
