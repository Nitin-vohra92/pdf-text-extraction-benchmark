Eisenstein cohomology for congruence subgroups of SO(n,2)

Introduction

Let there be given a connected linear semisimple algebraic group [formula] defined over [formula], a congruence subgroup [formula] and an irreducible finite dimensional complex representation (τ,E) of Γ. The group cohomology H*(Γ,E) of Γ with coefficients in E has a description in terms of the automorphic spectrum of Γ. More precisely, let [formula] denote the Lie algebra of [formula], K some maximal compact subgroup of [formula] and [formula] the space of automorphic forms on [formula] with respect to E. It is then a consequence of a result of J. Franke (Theorem 18 in [\cite=Fra]) that the group cohomology H*(Γ,E) is isomorphic to the automorphic cohomology [formula] of Γ.

Eisenstein cohomology refers to the attempt to construct cohomology classes (in the automorphic cohomology of Γ) in terms of Eisenstein series associated to cusp forms for the projection of Γ to a Levi subgroup of [formula] and to ultimately describe a natural orthogonal complement of the cuspidal cohomology in the automorphic cohomology of Γ. The basic idea is due to G. Harder (cf. [\cite=Har2]) and appeals to the theory of Eisenstein series as developed by R. Langlands (cf. [\cite=Lan], [\cite=MW]).

The remainder of this introduction gives a brief outline of the technique of Eisenstein cohomology in terms of the algebraic [formula]-group [formula] chosen for the present paper, though in the adèlic and representation-theoretic setting.

Thus, for the moment [formula] is to denote a [formula]-rational form of [formula]-rank 2 of the real semisimple Lie group SO(n,2) for [formula], (τ,E) to be an irreducible finite-dimensional complex representation of [formula] and [formula] the space of adèlic automorphic forms for [formula] with respect to E. The automorphic cohomology of [formula] with coefficients in E is the relative Lie algebra cohomology [formula] allowing of a decomposition as an algebraic direct sum

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the space of cusp forms in AE, [formula] the associate class of a parabolic [formula]-subgroup [formula] and [formula] the space of automorphic forms negligible along every parabolic [formula]-subgroup [formula] with [formula]. The algebraic direct sum of the summands indexed by [formula] is called the Eisenstein cohomology of [formula].

As for the scope of the present work the account of the Eisenstein cohomology for maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroups given is subject to the overall hypothesis that the highest weight λτ of (τ,E) be regular. That is, it is regular Eisenstein cohomology classes which are constructed. Since the associate and conjugacy classes of parabolic [formula]-subgroups coincide for the given group [formula], it suffices to restrict to standard parabolic [formula]-subgroups [formula].

The construction starts from so-called classes of type (π,w) in the cuspidal cohomology of the Levi component [formula] of [formula]. The type comprises a minimal coset representative w for the orbit space of the Weyl group [formula] of [formula] acting on the Weyl group W of [formula]; and essentially an irreducible unitary representation π of the group of real points of [formula] with non-trivial cohomology twisted by an irreducible finite-dimensional complex rational representation of [formula] induced by (τ,E) and depending on w. The set [formula] of minimal coset representatives w is determined explicitly for the two standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroups [formula] by way of producing what is called the Hasse diagram of a partially ordered set, in this case of the W-orbit of a certain weight associated to [formula]. Section [\ref=Kostant] gives the results. In particular, it is the usage of the Hasse diagram of [formula] enabling one to overcome the technical difficulties in dealing with the elements of [formula] arising from the fact that its order grows polynomially along with n. Appendix [\ref=diagram] provides a concise introduction to the notion of Hasse diagram as it is utilised here. The representations π of the Levi components [formula] for the two standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroups [formula] are described in section [\ref=cohrep] up to unitary equivalence according to the Vogan-Zuckerman classification.

Finally, lifting a given class of type (π,w) into [formula] by means of parabolic induction followed by Eisenstein summation, the thus obtained Eisenstein series is evaluated at a certain point λw stemming from λτ in a way that is uniquely determined by [formula] and all non-trivial classes are identified. A description of the summands [formula] in the Eisenstein cohomology corresponding to standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroups [formula] is displayed in the main Theorems [\ref=myfirst] to [\ref=mythird] of the paper.

I'd like to express my gratitude to Joachim Schwermer for sharing his knowledge and expertise.

Preliminaries

Reductive algebraic [formula]-groups

As in the introduction [formula] will always denote some connected linear algebraic group defined over [formula], which henceforth is allowed to be reductive. For any commutative [formula]-algebra A the group of A-points of [formula] is defined to be [formula].

The group of complex, resp. rational characters of [formula] defined over [formula] is denoted as [formula], resp. [formula]. The algebraic [formula]-subgroup [formula] is normal in [formula] and contains all compact and arithmetic subgroups of [formula].

Let [formula] be a Borel subgroup such that [formula] with corresponding positive system Φ+. Suppose [formula] be a standard parabolic subgroup of [formula] and [formula] some Levi subgroup. The Weyl group [formula] of the root system [formula] can be embedded into W and the quotient [formula] has a distinguished set of representatives, the set

[formula]

of minimal coset representatives. Here, [formula] is to denote the set of simple roots of the positive system on [formula] induced by Φ+.

The parabolic [formula]-subgroups [formula] which are standard with respect to [formula] and [formula] are in 1 - 1 correspondence with the subsets I of the set [formula] of simple rational roots. Specifically, if [formula], set [formula] for the subtorus of [formula] defined by I and [formula] for its centraliser. The latter one is the Levi component of a unique parabolic [formula]-subgroup [formula] of [formula] with unipotent radical denoted by [formula]. Since [formula] is an almost direct product [formula] where [formula], the Levi decomposition of [formula] admits the refinement [formula]. For an arbitrary parabolic [formula]-subgroup [formula] of [formula] the alike decomposition is written as [formula].

Two parabolic [formula]-subgroups [formula] are called associate, if there is an element [formula] such that [formula], where [formula] denotes the inner automorphism on [formula] induced by g. The associate class of [formula] is denoted by [formula] and the finite collection of all these by [formula].

The group of real points and Lie algebras

The complex Lie algebra of an algebraic [formula]-group [formula] will be denoted as [formula]. The real form of [formula] corresponding to the group [formula] of real points will be indicated by putting a '0' as subscript, that is [formula]. In addition, for an abelian Lie algebra [formula] the dual is denoted as [formula]. If [formula] is a Cartan subalgebra an arbitrary element in [formula] will be denoted by λ, as will be its restriction to [formula].

Often the group [formula] of real points of an algebraic [formula]-group will be denoted by G, the connected component containing the identity by G+. The symmetric space X associated to G is the space of maximal compact subgroups of G. If K  ⊂  G is a maximal compact subgroup let Θ, resp. θ denote the corresponding Cartan involution on G, resp. [formula]. The Cartan decomposition is written as [formula] with [formula] and [formula] the - 1-eigenspace of θ. Whereas the intersection of K with a subgroup H  ⊂  G will be written as KH, the corresponding restrictions of the Cartan involution, resp. decomposition are denoted with the same letters. By common abuse of language the unique complex linear extension of θ to [formula] is called Cartan involution again and denoted by the same letter. In addition, let σ denote the conjugation on [formula] induced by [formula].

Let [formula] be a maximally compact θ-stable Cartan subalgebra and set [formula] for the compact, [formula] for the non-compact part. Next, suppose [formula] is a θ-stable parabolic subalgebra containing [formula], i.e. [formula] is stable under θ and [formula] is a maximal reductive Lie subalgebra. Let [formula] be its nil radical and [formula] a Levi decomposition. In [\ref=cohrep] the set [formula] of weights for the adjoint action of [formula] in [formula] will be of significance. In addition, [formula] is to denote half the sum of all weights in [formula]. Notation will be analogous for any reductive Lie subalgebra of [formula].

The group of adèles and adèlic automorphic forms

The ring of adèles over [formula] is denoted as [formula]. It is the direct product [formula] of the field of real numbers and the ring [formula] of finite adèles.

Let [formula] be a maximal compact subgroup of the group of adèles of [formula]. It writes as a product [formula] with [formula] a restricted product [formula] over all primes [formula], and [formula] a maximal compact subgroup. In addition, it is assumed that [formula] is in good position relative to the minimal parabolic [formula]-subgroup [formula] corresponding to the choice of [formula]. The latter condition implies that the standard height function [formula] for a standard parabolic [formula]-subgroup [formula] has an extension to [formula], again denoted by [formula].

Let [formula] be the center of the universal enveloping algebra [formula] of [formula]. Then [formula] acts on the dual representation [formula] of E. Let [formula] be the annihilator of [formula] in [formula] and set AE for the space of complex-valued, [formula]-finite, smooth functions of uniform moderate growth on [formula] which are annihilated by a power of I. The space AE is a [formula]-module and its elements are called adèlic automorphic forms for [formula] (relative to E).

Automorphic cohomology for congruence groups

In the present and subsequent section [formula] is assumed to have [formula]-anisotropic center and positive semisimple [formula]-rank. As before (τ,E) denotes some irreducible finite-dimensional complex representation of [formula] of highest weight λτ. As stated in the introduction the automorphic cohomology of [formula] with respect to E by definition is the relative Lie algebra cohomology [formula] with coefficients in AE twisted by E.

Decomposition along the cuspidal support

The space AE allows of a decomposition along the cuspidal support of distinct associate classes of parabolic [formula]-subgroups. (See [\cite=F-S], [\cite=MW] for details).

First, let [formula] be the space of smooth, complex-valued functions on [formula] of uniform moderate growth, and for [formula] set [formula] for the space of elements of [formula] which are negligible along [formula] for every parabolic [formula]-subgroup [formula]. That is, the constant term of an element in [formula] with respect to [formula] is orthogonal to the space of cusp forms on [formula]. The space [formula] is a [formula]-module and admits a decomposition

[formula]

as a finite direct sum of [formula]-modules as proved by Langlands. This decomposition descends to the submodule AE, that is

[formula]

with [formula] and the isomorphism being one of [formula]-modules. (Of course, [formula]).

Next, let [formula] and π be an irreducible representation of [formula], unitary modulo the center, and such that (1) the central character [formula] is trivial on [formula], (2) π occurs in the cuspidal summand [formula] and (3) the infinitesimal character of π matches the infinitesimal character of the dual representation [formula]. These conditions entail some compatibility requirements (cf. [\cite=F-S] p. 771) and we let [formula] be a finite set of such representations meeting them. As a consequence, two such sets [formula] for [formula] are associate by the dual of the inner automorphism of [formula] mapping the respective Levi components to one another. Finally, let [formula] denote the collection of all classes [formula].

Let [formula] for some [formula], where [formula] and set [formula] for the differential of the central character χπ restricted to [formula]. Then [formula] shall denote the space of all cuspidal automorphic forms on [formula] which transform according to π. Furthermore, let [formula] denote the irreducible unitary representation of [formula] obtained by normalising π with respect to the action of the central character χπ on [formula]. Let [formula] be the [formula]-module of smooth, [formula]-finite functions [formula] such that for any [formula] the function l  ↦  f(lg) for [formula] belongs to [formula]. To [formula] and [formula] we now associate an Eisenstein series [formula] to be a function in [formula], whenever convergent:

[formula]

Given that the real part of λ lies inside the positive Weyl chamber defined by [formula] being in addition sufficiently regular this series is known to converge normally for g in a compact set. As a function in λ it admits a meromorphic continuation to all of [formula] (cf. [\cite=MW] II.1.5).

Finally, we define [formula] as the space generated by all residues and derivatives of Eisenstein series [formula] for f ranging through [formula]. (Notice that this space is denoted by [formula] in [\cite=F-S]). Then there is a decomposition

[formula]

of [formula]-modules giving rise to the

([\cite=F-S]) Let [formula] be a connected reductive algebraic [formula]-group the center of which is anisotropic over [formula], and suppose it have positive semisimple [formula]-rank. Then there is a direct sum decomposition in cohomology

[formula]

where as before C denotes the set of classes [formula] of associate parabolic [formula]-subgroups and [formula] the set of classes [formula] of associate irreducible cuspidal automorphic representations of the Levi components of elements [formula].

Cuspidal classes of type (π,w)

Notation is as before, except henceforth we choose [formula] and π shall denote either a cuspidal automorphic representation of [formula] belonging to some [formula] or its archimedean component. For [formula] let [formula] denote the representation of [formula] induced from π by parabolic induction. Then there is an isomorphism

[formula]

of [formula]-modules, where m0(π) denotes the multiplicity of π in [formula]. This way the [formula]-action on [formula] carries over to [formula]. Moreover, the symmetric algebra [formula] of [formula] can be regarded as the space of differential operators [formula] with constant coefficients in [formula] for some multi-index ν.

Now, there exists a polynomial function q(λ) on [formula] such that for every [formula] there is a neighbourhood of [formula], in which [formula] is holomorphic (cf. [\cite=MW] IV.1). Hence, for [formula] and [formula] the mapping

[formula]

which assigns to an element [formula] the derivative of [formula] at dχπ with respect to [formula] yields a homomorphism

[formula]

of [formula]-modules.

The Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence in the category of [formula]-modules (cf. [\cite=B-W] III. Thm 3.3) associated to the double complex obtained from replacing the coefficient module in [formula] by some injective resolution of it abuts to the cohomology of D*, degenerates and has second term [formula]. Provided that the highest weight λτ of (τ,E) is dominant by a theorem of Kostant (cf. [\cite=Kos], 5.13) there is an isomorphism of [formula]-modules

[formula]

where μw = w(λτ  +  ρ) - ρ, resp. its restriction to the Cartan subalgebra corresponding to [formula] and Fμ denote an irreducible [formula]-module of highest weight μ. As a result,

[formula]

in view of which decomposition we give the

A cohomology class in [formula] is called a class of type (π,w).

If the highest weight λτ of (τ,E) is regular, the weights μw, [formula] are regular when restricted to the Cartan subalgebra corresponding to [formula].

Eisenstein cohomology in the generic case

The highest weight λτ of the irreducible finite dimensional complex rational representation (τ,E) of [formula] is now assumed to be regular. With notation as before the adèlic version of Theorem 4.11 in [\cite=Sch1] is

([\cite=Sch1]) Let [formula] be a parabolic [formula]-subgroup of [formula] and [formula] any element in its associate class. If the Eisenstein series [formula] attached to a non-trivial cohomology class in [formula] of type (π,w), where [formula], [formula] and [formula], is holomorphic at the point [formula], then [formula] represents a non-trivial cohomology class in [formula].

Concerning the question of holomorphy of the Eisenstein series [formula] at λw an affirmative answer can be given in general for maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroups.

([\cite=Sch4]) Let [formula] be a maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroup of [formula] and [formula] any element in its associate class. Let [formula] be the Eisenstein series attached to a non-trivial cohomology class in [formula] of type (π,w), where [formula], [formula] such that [formula], and [formula]. Then the meromorphic continuation of [formula] to [formula] is holomorphic at λw.

The vanishing theorem to follow was proven independently by J.-S. Li & J. Schwermer and L. Saper and is cited from [\cite=L-S]. The bounds for vanishing are given in terms of the two quantities: [formula], where [formula] is to denote the absolute rank of the group in question, and [formula].

If [formula] is a class of associate parabolic [formula]-subgroups and [formula], then the summand [formula] is spanned by regular Eisenstein cohomology classes and [formula] for [formula].

This is Theorem 5.5 in [\cite=L-S] for the case that the center of [formula] is anisotropic over [formula].

Using Poincaré duality (cf. Theorem 5.6 in [\cite=L-S]) it can be inferred that in the generic case the cuspidal cohomology of [formula] vanishes outside the interval

[formula]

Finally, let [formula] be the virtual cohomological dimension of [formula]. Then the range of non-vanishing of the automorphic cohomology of [formula] with respect to the degree is given by the interval

[formula]

A rational form of SO(n,2)

Let V be a vector space over [formula] of dimension n + 2 and f the regular quadratic form on V of Witt-index 2 represented by the symmetric matrix

[formula]

with In the n  ×  n identity matrix. Let [formula] denote the group of proper isometries of the rational quadratic space (V,f) and [formula] the [formula]-rational form of [formula]-rank 2 of the self-adjoint semisimple linear algebraic group [formula] obtained from [formula].

The group [formula] of real points of [formula] is isomorphic to the real semisimple Lie group SO(n,2), which has two connected components in the real topology.

For the sake of a treatment of the groups SO(n,2) - with n growing arbitrarily - as uniform as possible, it is assumed from now on that [formula] implying, in particular, that [formula] is not (quasi)-split.

The Lie algebra [formula] of [formula] is realised as the matrix algebra of complex (n + 2)  ×  (n + 2)-matrices X being skew-symmetric with respect to F. Then the real form [formula] is the subalgebra of all such X with real entries. The Cartan involution on [formula] is written as θ:X  ↦  FXF.

As [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] the type of its root system depends on the parity of n. In particular, the type is [formula] if [formula] and [formula] if 2|n. Throughout, both cases will be treated separately, although an attempt is made to keep redundancy as little as possible.

Rational roots and standard parabolic [formula]-subgroups [formula]

The subgroup [formula] is a maximal [formula]-split torus in [formula] with rational characters a1:sa1,a2  ↦  a1 and a2:sa1,a2  ↦  a2. The relative root system of [formula], which is of type B2, is then given as the set

[formula]

where moreover α1 = a1a- 12 and α2 = a2 are chosen to be simple.

The parabolic [formula]-subgroups [formula] of [formula] standard with respect to [formula] and [formula] are parametrised by the subsets I of [formula]. The maximal ones are listed below. In case of I1  =  {α2} the corresponding standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroup [formula] is described by

[formula]

In case of I2  =  {α1} the corresponding standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroup [formula] is described by

[formula]

The conjugacy classes and the associate classes of parabolic [formula]-subgroups of [formula] coincide.

The absolute root system

A maximal [formula]-torus [formula] containing [formula] is given by [formula]. A positive system Φ+ compatible with [formula] is provided in terms of the Lie algebra [formula] of its centraliser [formula].

The odd case

Let [formula] and set 2k = n + 1. The root system of [formula] is of type Bk in this case. In the realisation of [formula] mentioned above the Cartan subalgebra [formula] consists of complex block-diagonal matrices H = (a,b, - a), where a = (a1,a2) and b itself is a skew-symmetric 2  ×  2-block diagonal matrix with the (n - 2)nd column and row being zero. A block of b is written in the form

[formula]

with j = 2i + 1 denoting the j-th row for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k - 2. The set of roots for [formula] in [formula] is

[formula]

with linear functionals ε1(H) = a1, ε2(H) = a2 on the symmetric a-block and [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k - 2 on the skew-symmetric b-block. The simple roots in Φ are chosen to be αi  =  εi  -  εi + 1 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1 and αk  =  εk. Thus, the restriction of the root α1, resp. α2 to [formula] is the differential at the identity of the character α1, resp. α2 in [formula].

The standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroups [formula] are depicted via crossed Dynkin diagrams.

[formula]

The set [formula] of simple roots of the reductive algebraic [formula]-group [formula] can then be read off directly from the diagram as

[formula]

The even case

Let now 2|n and set 2k = n + 2. Then the root system of [formula] is of type Dk. The Cartan subalgebra [formula] corresponding to the choice of [formula] has the same form as in the odd case, this time, however, with b being of maximal rank. With notation analogous to the odd case the set of roots for [formula] in [formula] is

[formula]

and the simple roots in Φ are chosen to be αi  =  εi  -  εi + 1 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1 and αk  =  εk - 1  +  εk. The positive system Φ+ defined by the simple roots is compatible with the one on [formula] defined by [formula] and the crossed Dynkin diagrams for the standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroups [formula] are

[formula]

which exhibit the sets [formula] to be formally the same as in the odd case.

The Levi subalgebras

Consider the first standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroup [formula]. Then [formula] is realised relative to Fn - 1,1. Set [formula] for the Cartan subalgebra of [formula] obtained from [formula], then

[formula]

Consider now the second standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroup [formula]. Then [formula] is the Lie subalgebra of [formula] consisting of block diagonal matrices [formula] with a of trace zero. Set [formula] for the Cartan subalgebra of [formula] obtained from [formula], then

[formula]

As for i∈{1,2} the Levi subalgebra [formula] with [formula] the center of [formula], the Cartan subalgebra [formula] decomposes as [formula], which is even true in terms of the real forms.

Fundamental weights and coordinates

The fundamental weights defined by Δ are denoted in Bourbaki notation (cf. [\cite=Bou], Planche II, IV) and every weight [formula] will be written in coordinates λ = (λ1,...,λk) relative to the fundamental weights. Also, a dominant weight λ is regular if and only if λi > 0 for all [formula]. Suppose [formula], resp. [formula] be identified with the space of all linear forms on [formula] vanishing on [formula], resp. [formula]. In this way a canonical isomorphism [formula] can be obtained, which in turn allows to restrict weights on [formula] in a canonical way to its direct summands.

The odd case

Let [formula] and set 2k = n + 1. A basis of fundamental weights for each of the direct summands of the Cartan subalgebra is given in case of i = 1 by

[formula]

and in case i = 2 by

[formula]

Accordingly, the restriction of [formula] to [formula] and [formula] is given by:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Finally, let ρ denote half the sum of the positive roots in Φ and [formula] its restriction to [formula], i = 1,2. Then their coordinates are

[formula]

The even case

Let 2|n and set 2k = n + 2. A basis of fundamental weights for each of the direct summands of the Cartan subalgebra in case of i = 1:

[formula]

and in case i = 2:

[formula]

Accordingly, the restriction of [formula] to [formula] and [formula] is given by:

[formula]

and

[formula]

The coordinates of ρ and [formula] are formally identical to the ones in the odd case.

Classes of type (π,w)

The cohomological contribution of the summand [formula], [formula] a proper standard parabolic [formula]-subgroup of [formula], to the automorphic cohomology of [formula] can be reconstructed from cuspidal classes of types (π,w). Their determination starts with the second parameter. As for the question of how to obtain the elements of [formula] explicitly appendix [\ref=diagram] establishes an algorithm based on the results of [\cite=Kos].

Minimal coset representatives

The Weyl group W = W(Φ) of the root system [formula] is generated by the reflections sαi at the simple roots αi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k from section [\ref=absolute]. For the sake of convenience the generators of W will be written as [formula].

The following sets out to display the elements of [formula] for the standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroups of [formula] uniformly for all [formula]. Along with [formula] the number N(l) of such per length l = l(w) will be provided.

The first standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroup

The Weyl group [formula] is generated by the elements [formula] given that the positive system on [formula] is the one induced by Φ+. Let [formula] denote the set of minimal coset representatives of [formula].

The odd case

Let [formula] and set again 2k = n + 1. The order of [formula] is given as [formula] and the set [formula] is actually computed in table 1.

The even case

Let 2|n and 2k = n + 2. The order of [formula] is given as [formula] and the set [formula] is provided by table 2.

The second standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroup

The Weyl group [formula] is generated by the elements [formula]. Let [formula] denote the set of minimal coset representatives of [formula].

The odd case

Let [formula] and set 2k = n + 1. The order of [formula] is given as [formula] and the set [formula] is computed in table 3.

As it stands table 3 applies to cases [formula]. For n = 5,7 obvious minor adjustments are in place.

The even case

Let 2|n and 2k = n + 2. The set [formula] has order [formula] and its elements are displayed in table 4.

As it stands table 4 is valid for cases [formula] only. Again the remaining cases n = 6,8 can be easily supplied by minor adjustments.

The simple [formula]-modules of Kostant's theorem

As an immediate application of the determination of the minimal coset representatives this section provides a listing of weights μw = w(λ  +  ρ) - ρ for [formula], resp. their restrictions to the Cartan subalgebra [formula] for i = 1,2 occurring in Kostant's theorem. Notation is as in [\ref=fundamental].

Let [formula] be a weight. The restriction of [formula] to the Cartan subalgebra [formula] is formally identical in the odd and even case: [formula].

The odd case

Let [formula] and set 2k = n + 1. Table 5 lists the weights [formula] in this case.

For reasons of consistency it is assumed that 2  ≤  i  ≤  k - 2 in table 5.

The even case

Let 2|n and set 2k = n + 2. For table 6 below it is assumed that 2  ≤  i  ≤  k - 3.

As always, the natural number k is chosen such that 2k = n + 1, if [formula], resp. 2k = n + 2, if 2|n. Tables 7 and 8 provide the weights [formula] in respective cases.

Cohomological representations

The determination of data occurring as type (π,w) now proceeds to investigating the irreducible cuspidal automorphic representations π of [formula] with non-zero cohomology at the archimedean place, cohomological representations for short.

These are described in terms of the Vogan-Zuckerman classification via its Harish-Chandra modules [formula] (cf. [\cite=VZ]), which in turn are parametrised by pairs [formula], where [formula] is a θ-stable parabolic subalgebra of [formula] and λ is an admissible one dimensional representation of the Levi factor [formula] of [formula]. (Throughout the present section this is the only meaning of λ, and this meaning of λ is confined to that one section). The constructive part of the Vogan-Zuckerman classification states that for [formula] there exists a unique irreducible [formula]-module [formula] with non-zero cohomology.

Since the isomorphism class of [formula] is determined by its minimal K+M-type, it will suffice to give a complete set of representatives of pairs [formula] up to K+M-conjugacy realising all possible minimal K+M-types. With notation as in section [\ref=pre] the minimal K+M-type of [formula] is equal to [formula]. So actually, it will suffice to give a complete set of representatives of pairs [formula] realising all possible sets [formula]. Also, instead of [formula] its Levi subgroup [formula], the normaliser of [formula] in M, will be given.

The first standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroup

Let [formula] and drop the index for all objects associated to [formula]. In particular, write [formula] for the Levi component and M≃SO(n - 1,1) for the group of real points of the semisimple part therein. Recall that the Cartan decomposition corresponding to KM is written [formula]. Also, notice that an element [formula] looks like

[formula]

with [formula], x and [formula] vectors in [formula] and b skew-symmetric with respect to In - 2.

The odd case

Assume [formula] and set 2(k - 1) = n - 1. Then [formula] is of type Bk - 1, [formula], and [formula] is a maximally compact θ-stable Cartan subalgebra. The linear functional ε2 now extracts [formula]. Since it is trivial that [formula] implies [formula] for 3  ≤  i  ≤  k, the possibilities for [formula] are

[formula]

A complete set of representatives of θ-stable parabolic subalgebras realising all possible sets [formula] is given by any collection of θ-stable parabolic subalgebras [formula] containing [formula] and with Levi subgroups isomorphic to the reductive groups listed in table 9.

Let F = Fμ be an irreducible finite dimensional representation of [formula] with highest weight μ. For 0  ≤  i  ≤  k - 2 there is exactly one irreducible unitary representation Ai(λ) of SO(n - 1,1)+ with non-zero cohomology twisted by F, the one with [formula], and

[formula]

For i = k - 1 on the other hand there are two irreducible unitary representations A±k - 1(λ) of SO(n - 1,1)+ with non-zero cohomology twisted by F corresponding to whether [formula] contains εk or -  εk.

Since the Levi subgroup Li is compact for i = k - 1, the two representations A±k - 1(λ) belong to the discrete series of M+.

If the highest weight μ of F is assumed to be regular the necessary condition [formula] can be met only in case of the two representations A±k - 1(λ). As for a representation of M = SO(n - 1,1) consider the induced representation MM+(A+k - 1) = MM+(A-k - 1), the restriction of which back to M+ gives the direct sum [formula]. The final result is summarised in

Let F be an irreducible finite dimensional representation of [formula] of regular highest weight μ, also denoted by Fμ. The irreducible quotient Ak - 1(λ) of the induced representation MM+(A+k - 1(λ)) = MM+(A-k - 1(λ)), where λ  =  μ, then is the unique irreducible unitary representation of SO(n - 1,1) with non-zero cohomology twisted by F and

[formula]

The even case

Let now 2|n and set 2(k - 1) = n. Then [formula] is of type Dk - 1 and [formula]. The real form [formula] of the Cartan subalgebra of [formula] chosen in [\ref=Levis] is both maximally compact and maximally split. Here, the linear functionals introduced above are ordered as [formula]. (The reason for the reordering is that the positive system to be defined on [formula] needs to be θ-stable). In analogy with the odd case, the possibilities for [formula] are

[formula]

A complete set of representatives of θ-stable parabolic subalgebras realising all possible sets [formula] is given by any collection of θ-stable parabolic subalgebras [formula] containing [formula] and with Levi subgroups isomorphic to the reductive groups listed in table 10.

The groups displayed do not exhaust the Levi subgroups of non-isomorphic θ-stable parabolic subalgebras of [formula]; e.g. there is always one being isomorphic to SO(2)k - 2  ×  SO(2,1)+. Still, they parametrise all non-isomorphic irreducible [formula]-modules with non-zero cohomology determined by the Vogan-Zuckerman classification.

Let F = Fμ be an irreducible finite dimensional representation of [formula] with highest weight μ. For 0  ≤  i  ≤  k - 2 there is exactly one irreducible unitary representation Ai(λ) of SO(n - 1,1)+ with non-zero cohomology twisted by F, the one where [formula], and

[formula]

(Here, η denotes the Dynkin diagram automorphism induced by the unique element of maximal length in W, interchanging αk - 1 and αk).

The representation Ak - 2(λ) is tempered, unitarily induced.

Assume the highest weight μ of F now to be regular and consider the induced representation Ak - 2(λ) = MM+(Ak - 2(λ)) of M. The final result is contained in

Let F be an irreducible finite dimensional representation of [formula] of regular highest weight [formula], also denoted by Fμ. If μk  =  μk - 1, the irreducible quotient Ak - 2(λ) of MM+(Ak - 2(λ)), where λ  =  μ is the unique irreducible unitary representation of SO(n - 1,1) with non-zero cohomology twisted by F and

[formula]

If μk  ≠  μk - 1, there is no irreducible unitary representation of SO(n - 1,1)+ with non-zero cohomology twisted by F.

Rewriting [formula] in coordinates for the linear functionals εi get

[formula]

Doing the same thing for an admissible character λ of Li, [formula] yields

[formula]

with [formula], since λ is assumed to be unitary. Given that μ is regular the requirement [formula] can be met only if on the one hand λ is admissible with respect to [formula], that is [formula] for 2  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1, and on the other -  μk - 1  +  μk = 0.

The second standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroup

Let [formula] and drop the index for all objects associated to [formula]. In particular, [formula] shall denote the Levi component of [formula] and [formula] the group of real points of the semisimple part therein.

Here, the description of cohomological representations does not depend on the parity of n. Thus, the results are stated in a way appealing to both the odd and even case, though still in terms of pairs [formula].

The odd case and even case

In both cases there are just two Levi subgroups up to isomorphism, [formula] and Lk - 1 = SO(2)k - 1. If F is an irreducible finite dimensional representation of [formula] of regular highest weight μ, in case of Lk - 1 there are two irreducible unitary representations A+k - 1(λ) and A-k - 1(λ) of M+ with non-zero cohomology twisted by F. They owe to the discrete series of [formula]. The regularity of μ entails that there is none for L0. The result for M is stated in

Let F = Fμ be an irreducible finite dimensional representation of [formula] of regular highest weight μ. There is a unique irreducible unitary representation Ak - 1(λ) of [formula] with non-zero cohomology twisted by F, necessarily with λ  =  μ, and

[formula]

This representation is distinguished by the property that its restriction to M+ yields the direct sum [formula] of the two discrete series representations A+k - 1(λ) and A-k - 1(λ) of M+.

Classes of type (π,w)

The results obtained earlier in this section are combined and the classes of type (π,w) for the two standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroups of [formula] are listed.

Let [formula] and drop the index for all objects associated to and distinct from [formula].

The odd case

Let Fμw be the irreducible finite dimensional representation of [formula] of highest weight [formula] from Kostant's theorem (cf. [\ref=type]). Moreover, let δ be the Cayley transform mapping [formula] to [formula], the complexification of the maximally compact θ-stable Cartan subalgebra. According to Proposition [\ref=car1odd] the representation Ak - 1(λ) where [formula] is the unique irreducible unitary representation of M≃SO(n - 1,1) with non-zero cohomology twisted by Fμw.

Henceforth, notation is switched from the Harish-Chandra module to the unitary representation in order to introduce the abbreviation [formula].

The even case

Let Fμw be the irreducible finite dimensional representation of [formula] of highest weight [formula] from Kostant's theorem and suppose μk - 1  =  μk. In view of table 6 from [\ref=Lmodules] this constraint excludes the two representations Fμw with l(w) = k - 1 from the considerations to follow and amounts to requiring λk - 1  =  λk for the highest weight [formula] of (τ,E) in case of the remaining ones.

Here, the θ-stable Cartan subalgebra [formula] is itself maximally compact. Therefore, according to Proposition [\ref=car1even] the representation Ak - 2(λ) where [formula] is the unique irreducible unitary representation of M≃SO(n - 1,1) with non-zero cohomology twisted by Fμw. Again using the abbreviation [formula]

Let [formula] and drop the index for all objects associated to and distinct from [formula]. Since the subsequent discussion is formally identical for both cases it is given but once.

Let Fμw now be the irreducible finite dimensional representation of [formula] of highest weight [formula]. Moreover, let δ be the Cayley transform mapping [formula] to [formula], the complexification of the maximally compact θ-stable Cartan subalgebra. According to Proposition [\ref=car2odd] in either case there is exactly one irreducible unitary representation Ak - 1(λ) of [formula] with non-zero cohomology twisted by Fμw, the one with [formula]. In the notation [formula]

Regular Eisenstein cohomology classes

This section provides the construction of regular Eisenstein cohomology classes for the two standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroups of [formula]. The theorems appealing to the generic case (cf. section [\ref=regular]) are applied to obtain the final results. As a delineation of possible degrees in which those regular Eisenstein cohomology classes occur the general vanishing theorems are employed first.

Suppose now that the highest weight [formula] of the irreducible finite dimensional complex rational representation (τ,E) be regular.

The range of cohomology

The values for the two quantities l0 and q0 associated to [formula] are computed to be [formula] and [formula]. As a consequence, the following restrictions on the cohomology of [formula] can be inferred:

the automorphic cohomology of [formula] vanishes below degree n, i.e. [formula] for q < n. For q  ≥  n each summand [formula], [formula] is generated by regular Eisenstein cohomology classes.

the cuspidal cohomology of [formula] occurs only in degree n, i.e. [formula] for q  ≠  n.

The virtual cohomological dimension is found to be [formula]. Hence, as a matter of

In the generic case the automorphic cohomology [formula] of [formula] vanishes for [formula].

Regular Eisenstein cohomology classes

Let [formula] be a standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroup, π a cohomological representation of [formula] and [formula]. The Eisenstein series [formula] is evaluated at the real points [formula] , [formula] to obtain non-trivial cohomology classes.

The odd case

Let [formula] and 2k = n + 1. The real parameters λw for [formula] are given in their normalisation with respect to ρ1 in table 11.

The final result in the present case may now be stated as the

Let [formula] be the [formula]-rational form of [formula]-rank 2 of SO(n,2) introduced in section [\ref=q-form]. Suppose the highest weight [formula] of (τ,E) to be regular. Let [formula] be the standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroup of [formula] with Levi component [formula]. In the odd case the [formula]-module [formula]

is generated in degree q = k - 1 + l for k  ≤  l  ≤  n by the regular Eisenstein cohomology classes

[formula]

Notice that 4n - 4 - (3n - 1) = n - 3, which for [formula] implies that the summand [formula] doesn't ever contribute to the automorphic cohomology of [formula] in degree [formula].

Take a cuspidal class of type (πk - 1(μ),w), the degree of which is k - 1, and consider the associated Eisenstein series [formula] for [formula]. According to Theorem [\ref=mainthm], section [\ref=regular], if [formula] is holomorphic at λw, the automorphic form [formula] will represent a non-trivial Eisenstein cohomology class of degree q = k - 1 + l(w).

By the vanishing of the automorphic cohomology of [formula] in degrees less than n only the classes of type (πk - 1(μ),w) for those w have to be taken into account for which k - 1 + l(w)  ≥  n, that is for which l(w)  ≥  k. Since [formula] is maximal and [formula], Theorem [\ref=holomorphy], section [\ref=regular], ensures that [formula] is holomorphic at λw.

Finally, [formula] computes the upper bound for the non-vanishing.

The even case

Let 2|n and 2k = n + 2. The real parameters λw for [formula] are given in their normalisation with respect to ρ1 in table 12.

The final result about the summand in the automorphic cohomology of [formula] indexed by [formula] in the even case is

Let [formula] be the [formula]-rational form of [formula]-rank 2 of SO(n,2) introduced in section [\ref=q-form]. Suppose the highest weight [formula] of (τ,E) to be regular and such that λk - 1  =  λk. Let [formula] be the standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroup of [formula] with Levi component [formula]. In the even case the [formula]-module [formula]

is generated in degrees q∈[null] by the regular Eisenstein cohomology classes

[formula]

(i) As [formula] the difference [formula] shows that the summand [formula] doesn't ever contribute in degree [formula].

(ii) The proof is analogous to the odd case and as [formula] also the vanishing statement is seen to be true.

As before, the index is maintained for stating the final results.

The real parameters λw for [formula] are given in their normalisation with respect to ρ2 in tables 13 and 14 for the odd (2k = n + 1) and the even case (2k = n + 2) respectively.

As a matter of fact, which is also suggested by the table, for λw = a2ρ2 the minimum to be attained by a2 as λ ranges through the set of dominant regular weights depends only on the length of w.

The final result in both cases - apparently with a shift in meaning for k - reads as

Let [formula] be the [formula]-rational form of [formula]-rank 2 of SO(n,2) introduced in section [\ref=q-form]. Suppose the highest weight [formula] of (τ,E) to be regular. Let [formula] be the standard maximal parabolic [formula]-subgroup of [formula] with Levi component [formula]. In the odd case the [formula]-module [formula]

is generated in degree q = 1 + l for n - 1  ≤  l  ≤  2n - 3 by the regular Eisenstein cohomology classes

[formula]

(i) Notice that [formula] contributes in every single possible degree to the automorphic cohomology of [formula].

(ii) The proof follows along the same lines as that of Theorem [\ref=myfirst]. Here, [formula] computes the upper bound for the non-vanishing of [formula].

The set of minimal coset representatives as Hasse diagram

Studying reductive algebraic groups [formula] in general there is the question of how to determine the set [formula] of minimal coset representatives associated to a parabolic [formula]-subgroup [formula] by way of a preferably efficient algorithm. Such an algorithm is obtained by elaborating on the results of [\cite=Kos] (cf. [\cite=B-E]).

The Bruhat order on the Weyl group

Notation is as in section [\ref=pre]. Let [formula] denote the Weyl group for a fixed maximal torus [formula], [formula] be a Borel subgroup containing [formula] and Φ+ the corresponding system of positive roots. Then W can be given the structure of a partially ordered set by introducing the Bruhat order:

set w'  ≤  w if w = w''w' for some word w'' in the alphabet {sα}α∈Φ+ and l(w')  ≤  l(w),

where l(w) is the length of w∈W. Depicting W together with the Bruhat order as a directed graph yields what is called a Hasse diagram:

draw a vertex for each element w∈W and

join two elements w,w'∈W by an arrow [formula], if w = sαw' and l(w) = l(w') + 1.

Let [formula] be a parabolic subgroup of [formula] standard with respect to [formula]. The Weyl group [formula] acts as a subgroup on W and the orbit space [formula] has a distinguished set of representatives [formula], called the set of minimal coset representatives. As a subset of W it inherits the Bruhat order and thus the structure of a Hasse diagram. This structure will now be used to determine its elements.

The actual determination of the Hasse diagram

Let [formula] be the set of weights for the adjoint action of [formula] in the Lie algebra [formula] of the unipotent radical of [formula]. Now, if for w∈W the set Φw  =  {α∈Φ+|w- 1(α)∈  -  Φ+} is introduced, then

[formula]

simply for the fact that [formula]. So [formula] may as well be characterised as

[formula]

The sets Φw  ⊂  Φ+ have some nice properties, two of which are stated below.

(a) The cardinality of Φw is given as [formula].

(b) Let w∈W and α∈Φ+. Then α is either contained in Φw or Φsαw. Moreover, l(sαw) > l(w) if and only if [formula]. For a simple root α this specifies to: l(sαw) = l(w) + 1 if [formula] and l(sαw) = l(w) - 1 if α∈Φw.

The second one will be called 'back-or-forth alternative' due to the second part about simple roots.

For every w∈W there are unique elements [formula] and [formula] such that [formula] and [formula].

The second part of the proposition exhibits [formula] as the set of minimal coset representatives. A proof can be found in [\cite=Kos].

Let λ be a dominant weight, dominant for the derived group of [formula]. The Bruhat order on W induces a partial order on the W-orbit of λ: if w'  ≤  w, then w'(λ)  ≥  w(λ). And the idea is to realise [formula] as a subset of the W-orbit of an appropriate dominant weight λ. If [formula] is to denote the set of simple roots in [formula], define [formula] to be the sum of all fundamental weights corresponding to simple roots in [formula]. The desired algorithm can be established in guise of the

(1) The mapping [formula] induces a bijection between the set [formula] and the W-orbit of [formula].

(2) If [formula] and α∈Δ such that [formula] and [formula], then [formula], [formula] and [formula].

(a) Since sw(α) = wsαw- 1, wsα is seen to equal sw(α)w showing the result to fit the initial definition.

(b) The first condition in part (2) means not to go back, the second not to halt.

A proof can be supplied with the help of [\cite=B-E].

In order to actually make use of this algorithm the action of a simple reflection sα on a weight λ in Dynkin diagram notation has to be made explicit. Let [formula] be the set of simple roots in Φ+. Let [formula] denote the dual root for αi and ωi the fundamental weight corresponding to αi, 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. For any weight λ set [formula] for the coefficient of λ relative to ωi. In particular, [formula] and ci(λ) is placed above the node in the Dynkin diagram corresponding to αi. Now, the simple reflection sj = sαj takes λ to [formula], such that the coefficient of sj(λ) relative to ωi computes as

[formula]

The coefficient ci(λ) is altered by sj if and only if [formula]. Suppose therefore this to be granted, then there are two cases to be distinguished: if j = i, then of course ci(sj(λ)) =  - ci(λ). If on the other hand j  ≠  i, then [formula] corresponding to the following pieces of Dynkin diagrams:

[formula]

Consequently, the action of sj on a weight λ in Dynkin diagram notation with b = cj(λ) is seen to be:

[formula]

The operating device for applying the algorithm may now be stated as the two stage procedure:

Stage 1   depict the crossed Dynkin diagram for [formula] and write the coordinates of the weight [formula] relative to the fundamental weights above the corresponding crossed, resp. uncrossed nodes. Then take all simple reflections sα with [formula], apply every one of them separately to [formula] using the rules compiled in Dynkin diagram notation above, depict the resulting weights [formula] to the right of [formula] each joining to the latter by an arrow pointing to its transform under sα and labelled by sα. In the next step do the analogous thing for every [formula], that is having chosen one take all simple reflections sβ with [formula] and [formula] etc. Repeat this step by step operation until it stops, that is until it produces the situation that for any of the weights arrived at in the previous step the application of any simple reflection would map it to a preceding one or to itself. In terms of part (2) of the proposition this situation is the one, where for the first time no simple reflection is left meeting both hypotheses.

Stage 2   given the whole W-orbit of [formula] the elements of [formula] are obtained as the words in the simple reflections that can be built by reading the labels from the arrow to the very left to any arrow right to it.
