On the distribution of stellar masses in gamma-ray burst host galaxies

Introduction

It is central to contemporary cosmology to map the buildup of cosmic structure and star formation (SF), and we know that the detection of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is an indication that its host galaxy harbours massive SF. GRBs are pulses of γ-rays from sources of cosmological origins and are the most luminous, photon-emitting events in the universe. As tracers of SF, they have some fundamental advantages: dust extinction has essentially no effect in their detection at γ-ray and X-ray wavelengths and GRBs can be observed to very high redshifts. That is to say that GRBs can furnish us with unique eyes to gainfully look at the star-forming universe. But the following critical questions should be answered in order to use GRBs as tracers of SF: What is the level of bias in those GRB host samples that have been optically selected? And what is the intrinsic bias in the GRB-SF rate?

A canonical model is rather well established for long-duration GRBs; they occur in star-forming regions within star-forming galaxies [\citep=bloom02] [\citep=gorosabel03a] [\citep=christensen04] [\citep=fruchter06] and are associated with stellar core collapse events and hence with high-mass SF [\citep=galama98] [\citep=hjorth03] [\citep=stanek03] [\citep=zeh04] [\citep=campana06]. The emerging picture, however, is a complex one. Most GRB host galaxies are faint and blue [\citep=fruchter99] [\citep=le_floc'h03]. A few hosts show tentative evidence of very high star formation rates [\citep=chary02] [\citep=berger03] [\citep=michałowski08], but their optical properties do not appear typical of the galaxies that can be found in blind submillimeter galaxy surveys [\citep=tanvir04] [\citep=fruchter06].

It is currently debated how GRB hosts relate to other known populations of star-forming galaxies. At redshifts around 3, the UV luminosities of host galaxies and the metallicities of GRB sightlines are consistent with the expectations if hosts are drawn from the underlying population of all star-forming galaxies weighted with the total SF density per luminosity bin [\citep=jakobsson05a] [\citep=fynbo08]. With Spitzer's [\citep=werner04] IRAC [\citep=fazio04] mid-infrared (MIR) photometry, together with optical and near-infrared (NIR) data, we can establish how the host galaxies relate to other star-forming populations in terms of total stellar mass ([formula]). This is essential if we are to understand the full range of properties of star-forming galaxies at high redshifts and fully exploit the potential of GRBs as probes of cosmic SF.

[\citet=castro_cerón06] studied a sample of six long-duration GRB host galaxies observed with IRAC and MIPS [\citep=rieke04]. They estimated their [formula] based on rest-frame K-band luminosity densities and constrained their SFRs based on the entire available spectral energy distribution (SED). In this work, we extend the computations to a sample of 30 but constrain only the dust-uncorrected UV SFRs with the rest-frame UV continuum. This larger sample ought to allow for a more robust statistical analysis, as well as to probe the distribution of [formula] in redshift space. To determine [formula] we utilise rest-frame K flux densities (interpolated from observed IRAC and NIR fluxes). This extends the data set presented by [\citet=castro_cerón06], yielding accurate values of [formula] in a large host galaxy sample. To determine the dust-uncorrected UV SFRs, we use rest-frame UV flux densities (interpolated from observed optical fluxes). These dust-uncorrected UV SFRs are lower limits to the total SFR of a galaxy due to the possible extinction by dust, and we compare them with those of [\citet=castro_cerón06]. Our paper is organised as follows. An overview of the sample selection is given in Section [\ref=data]. The analytic methodology is described in Section [\ref=method]. [formula] for the sample are derived in Section [\ref=M*], and Section [\ref=SFRs] sees the computation of the dust-uncorrected UV SFRs. We conclude in Section [\ref=analysis] with analysis and discussion. We assume an Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7 cosmology with H0 = 70 km s- 1 Mpc- 1.

Data

Our current sample is composed of 30 long-duration GRB host galaxies, three of them within the X-ray flash category [\citep=heise03]. We made the selection by requiring each host to have rest-frame K-band data available (for the purposes of this work, we define K [formula] 2.2 μm ±   0.3 μm), thus the [formula] estimator is well calibrated [\citep=glazebrook04]. An additional requirement for inclusion in the sample was the availability of the redshift.

The sample of these 30 GRB host galaxies spans a redshift interval 0 <   z <   2.7, with a median value z ≃ 0.84. For comparison, the median redshift of those GRBs detected prior to the start of operations of the Swift satellite [\citep=gehrels04] is 〈z〉 ≃ 1.0, and that of those GRBs detected afterward is 〈z〉 ≃ 2.2; i.e., in this work we are chiefly looking at the lower end of the GRB redshift distribution. Given the redshifts sampled, the rest-frame K-band data for 24 of the 30 host galaxies were obtained from the Spitzer Science Archive, where we examined all publicly available hosts up to (and including) October 2007. The remaining six GRB hosts (, , , , , and ) in the sample have very low redshifts (z [formula] 0.1), so in those cases Kλobs ~   Kλrest (i.e., Kλrest falls within the nominal width of Kλobs). But for three of these host galaxies Spitzer data were available, and such data were included in the computation of the rest-frame K-band flux density by means of linear interpolation in log space with the corresponding Kλobs data (see Section [\ref=method]). The sample is presented in Table [\ref=flux:m*:sfr]. Figure [\ref=mosaic] displays postage stamps for each GRB host galaxy observed by Spitzer.

Each host (except GRBs , , and ) was imaged with IRAC. Detectors are 256 ×   256 square pixel arrays (scale = 1 pixel- 1 ×   1 pixel- 1; field of view = 5  ×   5 ). The instrumental point-spread functions (PSF; FWHM) are 1 pixel- 1, 1 pixel- 1, 1 pixel- 1, and 1 pixel- 1 for channels 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The optical and NIR data complementing IRAC in Table [\ref=flux:m*:sfr] were obtained from the literature. Two UV data points (GRBs and ) come from our analysis of GALEX [\citep=martin03] [\citep=martin05] data.

Methodology

For the MIR photometry, we use official Spitzer Post Basic Calibrated Data (Post-BCD) products. To ensure the validity of this photometry, we have performed a complete reduction of the corresponding BCD data for a subset of 14 sources (including the six in [\citealt=castro_cerón06]), carefully following the recommended calibration steps in the IRAC Instrument Handbook. The fluxes resulting from the two methods for these 14 sources were always consistent within errors. The typical discrepancy between the two flux measurements was in the range of 0.1σ-0.5σ. We achieved host extraction (see Figure [\ref=mosaic]) by combining the world coordinate system (WCS) calibration of the Spitzer images with the best set of published coordinates for each host galaxy. Spitzer's IRAC pointing reconstruction is typically [formula]1arcsec, and the positions of our GRB hosts were always known a priori to an accuracy of 0 or better. The median separation between the host centroid in each IRAC image and the published coordinates is well below 1arcsec. We checked the astrometric coincidence of the Spitzer WCS against the best published positions and derived a range of astrometric separations for our objects of 0.6σ-1.4σ. is the only host galaxy resolved in the IRAC images, and we have obtained its photometry from the literature [\citep=le_floc'h06]. None of the other GRB host galaxies of our sample are spatially resolved in the IRAC images, and their flux densities can be estimated using small circular aperture photometry. We measure the flux densities over a circled area of radius 2 pixels. In most cases, this allows us to recover the emission of the host while avoiding contamination from other field sources located nearby. But in a few instances, there was suspicion that the nearby field sources might be contaminating our host galaxy photometry. As a sanity check, we subtracted those field sources and redid the photometry. Field-source subtraction was performed using the detection output image given by the Source Extractor software package [\citep=bertin96], where the detected sources were replaced by background noise. This procedure was repeated several times, randomly varying the seeds to generate the noise in each case. The photometry on the field-source-subtracted images was always consistent with the original aperture photometry. The departure of the flux values (about 0.3-0.4 μJy) between the subtracted and non-subtracted photometries was 0.1σ. This uncertainty was accounted for in the errors listed in Table [\ref=flux:m*:sfr], column (3), yet it is small in comparison with the intrinsic photometric errors which dominate. Aperture corrections have been applied to account for the extended size of the PSF. We utilised the Spitzer Science Centre (SSC) recipe for estimating signal-to-noise ratio of a Point Source Measurement for IRAC as a starting point to calculate conservative errors, including both statistical and systematic estimates. Our flux density measurements and upper limits are given in Table [\ref=flux:m*:sfr], column (3). We find that, of those hosts in our sample observed with channel 1, about 36% are detected. For channel 2 the rate is about 64%. This is roughly of the same order as the detection rate by [\citet=le_floc'h06] with IRAC channel 2 (44%), though we caution that both samples are incomplete and suffer from selection biases.

For each GRB host, we compute the flux density at the central wavelength of the rest-frame K band by linear interpolation in log space. We interpolate between the IRAC channel and the closest passband, blueward of IRAC, for which data are available in the literature. In a few cases the IRAC waveband corresponds to a rest-frame wavelength shorter than K band, thus we extrapolate linearly. The rest-frame K-band flux densities are shown in Table [\ref=flux:m*:sfr], column (4), along with the appropriate references. In those cases for which only an upper limit to [formula] can be computed, we also estimate a conservative lower limit by linearly extrapolating a flat spectrum (fν [formula] ν0) from the reddest NIR/optical detection available (references in Table [\ref=flux:m*:sfr], column 4). These lower limits are presented as solid bars in Figures [\ref=z_m*], [\ref=ssfr_vs_m*], and [\ref=galaxy_samples].

In the same fashion described above for the rest-frame K band, we compute for each host the rest-frame UV continuum [\citep=kennicutt98] flux density. We either interpolate linearly in log space between the two closest passbands that bracket the rest-frame UV continuum, with data available from the literature, or, when all available data fall redward of 2 800 Å, we extrapolate linearly. These results and the uncertainties resulting from the interpolation or extrapolation are shown in Table [\ref=flux:m*:sfr], column (6). The presence of dust curves the spectral shape around 2 800 Å, yet in our case the spectral ranges for interpolating or extrapolating are small [\citep=michałowski08], so they can be well approximated by a linear spectral shape.

All flux densities listed in Table [\ref=flux:m*:sfr] are corrected for foreground Galactic dust extinction (see the Notes of Table [\ref=flux:m*:sfr] for the details). Conversion of the magnitudes obtained from the literature to flux densities is based on [\citet=fukugita95] for the optical passbands and on [\citet=tokunaga05] and [\citet=cohen03] for the NIR passbands. The error introduced by the assumption of these photometric systems never dominates the photometric uncertainties itself and is safely neglected.

Total Stellar Masses

We infer [formula] for our sample from rest-frame K-band luminosity densities. The light emitted by a galaxy in the K band (e.g., the MIR photometry analysed in this work) is closely related to its [formula] and thus it is a reliable estimator [\citep=glazebrook04]. It has little sensitivity to dust since the majority of a galaxy's stellar population has moved away from the birth clouds and because the NIR passbands are virtually unaffected by dust extinction. Such derivation of [formula] is more physically meaningful than the optical/UV luminosity; it effectively integrates over the accumulated [formula] and merger history and can only increase with time, in contrast, for instance, to UV light.

In order to obtain [formula] we apply

[formula]

where for any given object, DL is its luminosity distance in cm; [formula] is its flux density at the observed wavelength in μJy; observations should have been made at wavelengths 1.9 μm <   [formula]/(1+z) <   2.5 μm (e.g., this work); and the factor of 2.67 ×   10- 48 converts the second term in Equation ([\ref=eq_m*]) to units of solar luminosity. The third term in Equation ([\ref=eq_m*]), [formula], also in solar units, must be estimated for each object.

[formula] depends to some extent on the composition of the stellar population [\citep=portinari04] or, according to [\citet=labbé05] who used [\citet=bruzual03] with a [\citet=salpeter55] IMF, on the rest-frame U - V colour, age, and [formula]. GRB host galaxies are blue, young, and faint [\citep=le_floc'h03] [\citep=berger03] [\citep=christensen04]. In [\citet=castro_cerón06], [formula] was assumed to be ~  0.1 [formula]/[formula] to obtain robust lower limits. For this work, we compute [formula] for GRBs , , and with the rest-frame K-band flux densities from Table [\ref=flux:m*:sfr], column (4), and [formula] values derived from stellar population model SED fitting [\citep=michałowski08] and obtain the following results: 0.29 [formula]/[formula] for , 0.63 [formula]/[formula] for , and 0.43 [formula]/[formula] for . These results yield a mean [formula] = 0.45 [formula]/[formula], consistent with the average [formula] value in [\citet=courty07], and among the lowest [formula] ratios presented by [\citet=portinari04] for a [\citet=salpeter55] IMF.

It is sensible to calculate an average [formula] because this ratio is nearly constant, with little dependence on the previous SF history. In fact, [formula] varies only by a factor of 2 between extremely young and extremely old galaxy stellar populations [\citep=glazebrook04]. So, to be conservative we estimate 0.4 [formula]/[formula] in the calculations of [formula] for our host sample. Table [\ref=flux:m*:sfr], column (5) summarises our [formula] estimates. Errors quoted are statistical. We present a histogram of the distribution of [formula] in log space for our GRB host sample in Figure [\ref=m*_histogram]. [\citet=van_der_wel06] examined redshift-dependent systematics in determining [formula] from broadband SEDs. They found no significant bias for [\citet=bruzual03] models with a [\citet=salpeter55] IMF. Nonetheless, some caveats ought to be mentioned here to complement the discussion. We note that the strength of our [formula] determination is limited by the fact that we utilise only three hosts. Stellar population model SED fittings are available for them because these GRB host galaxies have radio and submillimeter detections. This might not be always the case for every GRB host. And some systematic uncertainties were introduced in the computation of the [formula] of those three hosts by employing population synthesis models.

For comparison, we plot in the background of Figure 2 the data from the preliminary analysis of [\citet=savaglio07]. The two samples have a 25 object overlap. Our results suggest more massive hosts, about half an order of magnitude higher (median [formula] = 109.7 [formula] in ours versus median [formula] = 109.3 [formula] in [\citealt=savaglio07]; both distributions have a 1σ dispersion of 0.8 dex, and in both cases the average has the same value as the median). [\citet=savaglio06] [\citet=savaglio07] fit the optical-NIR SEDs of their host galaxy sample together with a complex set of SF histories. We reproduce the median and average [formula] in [\citet=savaglio07] with our data set by applying [formula] = 0.2 [formula]/[formula] (the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicates to a high probability, p ~   0.99, likely because of the 25 object overlap, that our data set and that of [\citealt=savaglio07] come from a population with the same specific distribution). It thus appears that an adjustment by a factor of ~  2 to the [formula] ratio might explain the discrepancies in [formula] between our work and that of [\citet=savaglio07]. We note that such an adjustment is within the spread of our calculated values (cf. 0.29 [formula]/[formula], 0.43 [formula]/[formula], and 0.63 [formula]/[formula]). The fact that we find larger [formula] may also be indicative of underestimated dust extinction in [\citet=savaglio07].

Our [formula] are always lower than those of the normal 0.4 <   z <   2 galaxies from the Gemini Deep Deep Survey [\citep=abraham04] [\citep=savaglio06]. The GDDS is a deep optical-NIR (K <   20.6) survey complete, for the already mentioned redshift range, down to [formula] = 1010.8 [formula] for all galaxies and to [formula] = 1010.1 [formula] for star-forming galaxies. In our host sample, at least 70% of the galaxies have [formula] <   1010.1 [formula]. This comparison clearly highlights the efficiency of the GRB selection technique, against that of traditional high-redshift surveys, to pick low-[formula] galaxies at high redshifts. This is in agreement with results by [\citet=conselice05]. By looking at the light concentration, which is a proxy to total mass, they found that GRB hosts were less concentrated and therefore less massive than field galaxies at similar redshifts. However, caveat has it the GDDS is mass selected and naturally looks for the high end mass of the distribution. From Figure [\ref=ssfr_vs_m*], one can infer that the efficiency of GRBs to pick low-[formula] galaxies at high redshifts might decrease when compared against other surveys.

We plot [formula] as a function of the redshifts for our sample of 30 GRB host galaxies in Figure [\ref=z_m*] and find no intrinsic correlation between the two variables. The scatter of [formula] is rather uniform across most of the redshift distribution. Hosts with very low [formula] are only found at low redshift. For instance, the four GRB hosts (i.e., , , , and ) with the lowest [formula] (<   109 [formula]) have some of the lowest redshift values in our sample. Very low-[formula], high-redshift hosts would have been excluded since most of our largely pre- Swift redshifts were measured in emission, what selects preferentially bright host galaxies. Because the redshift is a requirement for inclusion in our sample, we are effectively biased against faint systems. This situation has now been corrected in the Swift era when most redshifts are secured via afterglow absorption spectroscopy. The upper limits in the vertical bars of Figure [\ref=z_m*] (i.e., the distribution for each non-detection measurement of [formula]) mark the sensitivity-limited curve for [formula]. Conversely, the absence of high-[formula], low-redshift hosts suggests that such GRB host galaxies are rare.

Star Formation Rates

We compute the dust-uncorrected UV SFR for each host by means of their UV continuum luminosity. We convert flux densities into luminosity densities using Lν(νrest)  =  4πD2Lfν(νobserved) / (1 + z) [\citep=hogg02]. Then, we can calculate the dust-uncorrected UV SFRs by applying SFR[formula] (erg s- 1) to the rest-frame λ = 2 800 Å flux densities [\citep=kennicutt98]. The results are summarised in Table [\ref=flux:m*:sfr], column (7). Errors quoted are statistical. In addition, there are systematic errors of order 30% [\citep=kennicutt98].

The specific SFR φ [formula] SFR/[formula] gives an indication of how intense star-forming a galaxy is. In Figure [\ref=ssfr_vs_m*], we plot φ versus [formula] for our GRB host sample. The absence of hosts in the lower-left corner is explained as a combination of selection effects and low-number statistics. A host galaxy in this region of the plot has both low [formula] and low SFR, making its detection difficult unless at very low redshifts. As the sampled comoving volume becomes smaller because of the lower redshift required to make a detection, the chance of finding a host decreases accordingly. Given the size of our sample, it is reasonable to expect no detections in this area of the plot. The four GRB host galaxies with the lowest [formula] (GRBs , , , and ) are all at very low redshifts and UV bright. We also note that our sample may be biased against low-SFR hosts, since many redshifts have been measured from emission lines. On the other hand, the non-detection of any GRB host in the upper-right corner of Figure [\ref=ssfr_vs_m*] should not be due to a selection effect. Such hosts either do not exist or their afterglows were extincted by dust, thus preventing their localisation. The sample at hand offers some indication as to the former possibility. Our two host galaxies with the highest [formula] (GRBs and ) would require a dust extinction of AV ~   5 mag to show there. Yet, such dust-extinction levels can be ruled out by the constraints on the SFR from the IR and the radio (see Section [\ref=analysis] below).

To exemplify how the estimation of [formula] ~   0.4 [formula]/[formula] affects the location of our hosts in the plot, we suppose a 50% uncertainty. We repeat the exercise for an UV-continuum dust extinction of 1 mag. The corresponding displacements are plotted in Figures [\ref=ssfr_vs_m*] and [\ref=galaxy_samples] with black arrows. The magnitude of these displacements is limited enough not to affect our analysis.

Analysis and Discussion

We find that the GRB host galaxies in our current sample possess a wide range of properties; with 107 [formula] <   [formula] <   1011 [formula]; and 10- 2 [formula] yr- 1 <   dust-uncorrected UV SFR <   10 [formula] yr- 1. Yet, this diversity points toward low [formula], star-forming systems.

Part of our host sample is extinguished by dust. GRB hosts , , and ([\citealt=le_floc'h06]; [\citealt=castro_cerón06]), as well as , , and ([\citealt=berger01] [\citealt=berger03] [\citealt=tanvir04]; [\citealt=castro_cerón06]; [\citealt=michałowski08]), have highly obscured SFRs. Additionally, several authors argued for dust extinction in the host of [\citep=prochaska04] [\citep=margutti07]. Applying the recipe in [\citet=castro_cerón06] to this host galaxy's MIR photometry [\citep=lutz99] [\citep=dutra03], we obtain an SFRL8 - 1000 = 13 [formula] yr- 1. That brings the total number of extinguished hosts to at least 7 out of 30 and allows us to crudely estimate that >  25% of the sample in this work suffers significant dust extinction (AV [formula] 1 mag). Neither our sample of host galaxies nor those others cited in this work are bias-free. The searches for the GRBs in such samples have been carried out mostly following the localisation of an optical afterglow, implicitly biasing the sample against dust-extincted systems. Such potential bias strengthens our statement on dust extinction in GRB host galaxies. Parenthetically, we note that GRBs , , , and make up two-thirds of a redshift-z  ~  1-selected, small subsample [\citep=castro_cerón06] [\citep=le_floc'h06]. They hint at the possibility that even a higher fraction of hosts are affected by dust extinction, though with the caveat of low-number statistics.

[\citet=castro_cerón06] plotted φ versus [formula] for six GRB hosts and samples of five other representative types of galaxies: distant red galaxies (DRGs), Lyα emitters (LAEs), Lyman break galaxies (LBGs), submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), and an ensemble of optically selected, z ~   2 galaxies from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-North (GOODS-N) field. In Figure [\ref=galaxy_samples] we plot, with blue symbols, our sample of 30 hosts using a revised [formula] ratio, along with the samples in [\citet=castro_cerón06]. In our φ versus [formula] plot (i.e., Figure [\ref=galaxy_samples]; we use SFRUV), the obscuration of SF by dust pulls the GRB data points down along a vertical line. One way to reconcile the φ values of host galaxies in [\citet=castro_cerón06] and this work is to invoke extinction by dust of the order of AV ~   1-3 mag (see below). The conversion from AUV to AV follows [\citet=cardelli89].

A primary scientific goal in the quantification of galactic evolution is the derivation of the SF histories, as described by the temporal evolution of the SFR(t). [\citet=castro_cerón06] noted that their sample had TSFR <   tuniverse, allowing for a history of constant SF, with a robust lower limit in [formula] ([formula] ~   0.1 [formula]/[formula]). For the sample we present in this work, where we adopt [formula] ~   0.4 [formula]/[formula], clearly a few GRB host galaxies are not allowed to have a history of constant SF (i.e., young stars dominating the stellar populations of old galaxies; see the right ordinate axis in Figure [\ref=galaxy_samples]). Either a starburst episode was present in the past or a higher recent SFR is required. The latter possibility is consistent with a fraction of GRB hosts having SF extincted by dust. The hosts of GRBs and (open blue symbols in Figure [\ref=galaxy_samples]) are good examples because, under the assumption of constant SF, major dust extinction must be invoked to account for the age differences. φUV estimates result in TSFR ~   6 Gyr for and TSFR ~   32 Gyr for , while φIR estimates [\citep=castro_cerón06] result in TSFR ~   300 Myr for both of them. The discrepancies in TSFR imply a dust extinction of the order of AV ~   1.6 mag for and AV ~   2.5 mag for . These discrepancies are consistent with the radio-constrained SFR upper limits (~  100 [formula] yr- 1 for and ~  500 [formula] yr- 1 for ) derived by applying the [\citet=yun02] methodology to the deepest radio upper limits reported by [\citet=frail03].

A dilution effect is present in our MIR photometry. Hosts in our current sample are not spatially resolved in the Spitzer imagery (in the case of , we utilise the total flux of the galaxy for consistency with the rest of the sample). To estimate their [formula] we measure the total K-band light. LK traces the accumulation of [formula] [\citep=glazebrook04] while, most commonly, the SF is ongoing in only a small part of the host galaxy. So, we do not normalise our sample's dust-uncorrected UV SFRs by the total stellar mass of the star-forming region(s), rather by [formula], which results in lower φ values. This dilution effect pulls the GRB data points in a φ versus [formula] plot down along the diagonal (dashed) lines marking constant SFRs.

An apparent envelope can be visualised in Figures [\ref=ssfr_vs_m*] and [\ref=galaxy_samples]. This is a flat plateau (no objects are present above a certain φ value, ~  2.5 Gyr- 1) that starts to curve down beyond a particular [formula] (10[formula]). Extinction by dust, coupled with the dilution effect, could be used to explain this envelope. Correcting for dilution and, chiefly, for dust extinction would yield a new plot where our host sample would align consistently with the results/upper limits of [\citet=castro_cerón06] and provide support to the claim that GRB host galaxies are small and have some of the highest φ values.

We conclude by putting forward a simple idea for GRB hosts based on the data analysed here. As a working hypothesis we suggest that, while low [formula] hosts might only contain small amounts of dust (i.e., host galaxies with a low [formula] and a low SFR are rare; see Section [\ref=SFRs]), progressing upward in the [formula] distribution of host galaxies will yield significant dust extinction, as well as the already mentioned dilution effect (i.e., the apparent envelope described above for Figures [\ref=ssfr_vs_m*] and [\ref=galaxy_samples]). Our suggestion is consistent with the theoretical predictions presented in [\citet=lapi08]. They further predict that GRB host galaxies trace the faint end of the luminosity function of LBGs and LAEs. Future work (i.e., Herschel observations) on a complete host sample will allow us to test this by quantifying dust extinction and the dilution effect.

The nature of GRBs and is strongly debated as no supernova was associated with these long-duration GRBs to deep limits [\citep=fynbo06] [\citep=gehrels06] [\citep=della_valle06a] [\citep=gal-yam06]. falls within the distribution of other long-duration GRB hosts in our sample, whereas seems to be an outlier. Though, this may indirectly suggest that the progenitor of is different from other typical long-duration GRBs, we note that its SFR is in range with that of the bulk of the sample; and as for [formula], its properties are not very different from some of our other low-redshift host galaxies (e.g., GRBs , , and ).
