Introduction

Let π be a set of primes. We denote by π' the set of all primes not in π, by π(n) the set of prime divisors of a positive integer n, for a finite group G we denote π(|G|) by π(G). A positive integer n with π(n)  ⊆  π is called a π-number, a group G with π(G)  ⊆  π is called a π-group. A subgroup H of G is called a π-Hall subgroup, if π(H)  ⊆  π and π(|G:H|)  ⊆  π'. According to [\cite=Hall] we say that G satisfies Eπ (or briefly G∈Eπ), if G contains a π-Hall subgroup. If G∈Eπ and every two π-Hall subgroups are conjugate, then we say that G satisfies Cπ (G∈Cπ). If G∈Cπ and each π-subgroup of G is included in a π-Hall subgroup of G, then we say that G satisfies Dπ (G∈Dπ). A group satisfying Eπ (resp. Cπ, Dπ) is also called an Eπ-group (resp. a Cπ-group, a Dπ-group). Let A,B,H be subgroups of G such that [formula] and H  ≤  G. Then [formula] is the normalizer of A / B in H. If x∈NH(A / B), then x induces an automorphism of A / B by Ba  ↦  Bx- 1ax. Thus there exists a homomorphism [formula]. The image of NH(A / B) under this homomorphism is denoted by [formula] and is called a group of induced automorphisms of A / B, while the kernel of this homomorphism is denoted by CH(A / B) and is called the centralizer of A / B in H.

All results of the paper depend on the classification of finite simple groups. We can avoid its use with the following definition. A finite group is said to be a K-group, if all of its composition factors are known simple groups, i.e., are either cyclic of prime order, or alternating, or of Lie type, or sporadic. If we replace the term "finite group" by the term "finite K-group", then all results remain valid without the use of the classification of finite simple groups.

In [\cite=RevVdoDpiFinal] we proved the following theorem.

Let A be a normal subgroup of a finite group G. Then G∈Dπ if and only if A∈Dπ and G  /  A∈Dπ.

By using this theorem we obtain that a finite group G satisfies Dπ if and only if every composition factor satisfies Dπ. In [\cite=RevDpiDAN] an arithmetic description of finite simple Dπ-groups was obtained; thus there exists a precise exhaustive arithmetic criterion for determining whether a finite group G satisfies Dπ. Our aim is to find a similar criterion for Eπ.

The following easy proposition is well known (see [\cite=Hall]).

Let A be a normal subgroup of G. If H is a π-Hall subgroup of G, then [formula] is a π-Hall subgroup of A, and HA / A is a π-Hall subgroup of G / A.

It follows from this that a normal subgroup and a factor group of an Eπ-group satisfy Eπ. But an extension of an Eπ-group by an Eπ-group may fail to satisfy Eπ (see Example [\ref=ExtensionIsNotEpi]). Thus a criterion for a finite group to satisfy Eπ will be different in nature to a criterion for Dπ.

In [\cite=GrossExistence] Gross proved the following theorem.

Let [formula] be a composition series of a finite group G which is a refinement of a chief series of G. Then the following are equivalent:

H∈Eπ for all subgroups H such that H(  ∞  ) is subnormal in G, where H(  ∞  ) is the intersection of all members of the derived series of H.

[formula] for all A∈A(G).

[formula] for all i with [formula].

[formula] for all composition factors H / K of G.

The definition of [formula] is given above; the symbol A(G) denotes the set of all atoms of G. Recall that a subgroup A of G is called an atom, if A is subnormal in G, A = A', and A has exactly one maximal normal subgroup. If in statement (a) we take H = G, then we obtain that G∈Eπ. Thus the condition [formula] for all i with [formula] implies that G∈Eπ. The following result is our main theorem.

Let [formula] be a composition series of a finite group G. If, for some i, [formula], then [formula].

The recently completed classification of π-Hall subgroups in finite simple groups (see [\cite=RevVdoArxive]) is the main technical tool for the proof of the theorem. Combining Theorems [\ref=GrossExistenceCriterion] and [\ref=ExistenceCriterion] we obtain a criterion for a finite group to satisfy Eπ.

Let [formula] be a composition series of a finite group G which is a refinement of a chief series of G. Then the following are equivalent:

H∈Eπ for all subgroups H such that H(  ∞  ) is subnormal in G, where H(  ∞  ) is the intersection of all members of the derived series of H.

[formula] for all A∈A(G).

[formula] for all i with [formula].

[formula] for all composition factors H / K of G.

G∈Eπ.

If Gi / Gi - 1 is cyclic, then [formula] is also cyclic, hence [formula]. Thus we need to check that [formula] only for non-abelian composition factors. Moreover, let

[formula]

be a refinement of a chief series

[formula]

Then [formula] is a direct product of isomorphic simple groups. Assume that Gij + 1 / Gij is non-abelian; thus [formula] are non-abelian finite simple groups. We may choose the numbering of [formula] so that Gij + 1 is a complete preimage of T1 in G, Gij + 2 is a complete preimage of T1  ×  T2 in G, etc. Since for every [formula] we have Gij  ≤  CG(Gij + l / Gij + l - 1), we have by [\cite=Vdo] that [formula]. Assume that j = 0 so [formula] are subgroups of G. Since [formula] is a minimal normal subgroup of G, then G acts transitively by conjugation on the set [formula] and [formula] are all conjugate in G. By [\cite=Rob] we obtain that

[formula]

and

[formula]

for each [formula]; hence [formula]. Similarly, in the general case [formula]. Now [\cite=GrossExistence] implies that if [formula], then [formula] for each [formula]. Thus we obtain the following

Let [formula] be a refinement of a chief series [formula]. Then G∈Eπ if and only if for every non-abelian Gij + 1 / Gij we have [formula].

So we have the following problem: describe the almost simple Eπ-groups. Recall that a finite group G is called almost simple if generalized Fitting subgroup [formula] of G is simple, i.e., if [formula] for a non-abelian finite simple group S. If an arithmetic description of finite almost simple Eπ-groups is obtained, then Corollary [\ref=InducedAutomorphismsEpi] would give an exhaustive arithmetic criterion for determining whether a finite group G satisfies Eπ.

At the end of the paper we prove some corollaries to the main result. Corollary [\ref=SubDirectProduct] is the main result of [\cite=Ved], but the solution presented in [\cite=Ved] is known to contain a gap, which at the time of writing has yet to be filled.

A finite subdirect product of Eπ-groups satisfies Eπ.

Combining Proposition [\ref=base] and Corollary [\ref=SubDirectProduct] one can obtain an affirmative answer to [\cite=kour] and [\cite=Shemetkov].

For every set of primes π the class of all Eπ-groups is a formation.

In view of Proposition [\ref=base] a homomorphic image of a π-Hall subgroup is a π-Hall subgroup (in the homomorphic image of the Eπ-group). The following corollary shows that all π-Hall subgroups of a homomorphic image can be obtained in this way.

Every π-Hall of a homomorphic image of an Eπ-group G is the image of a π-Hall subgroup of G.

In contrast, there are examples showing that in general a normal subgroup of an Eπ-group may possess π-Hall subgroups that do not lie in any π-Hall subgroup of the whole group (cf. Lemma [\ref=HallExist] and Example [\ref=ex2]).

The main technical tool in the proof of Theorem [\ref=ExistenceCriterion] is the following lemma, which is of independent interest.

Let S be a non-abelian finite simple Eπ-group and suppose that [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] and there exists an element x of G such that [formula] and the order of x is either a power of 2, or a power of 3.

To prove this lemma we shall use the theorem about the number of classes of conjugate π-Hall subgroups in finite simple groups [\cite=RevVdoArxive].

Notation and preliminary results

The term "group" always means a "finite group". By π we always denote a set of primes. The expressions H  ≤  G and [formula] mean respectively that H is a subgroup and a normal subgroup of G. The symbol Kπ(G) denotes the set of classes of conjugate π-Hall subgroups of G and kπ(G) = |Kπ(G)|. The following lemma follows from the Schur-Zassenhaus Theorem (see [\cite=Hall] or [\cite=Suz], for example).

If every factor of a subnormal series of G are either a π-group or a π'-group, then G∈Dπ.

Let M, N be normal subgroups of a group G such that [formula], and A,B subgroups of M such that [formula]. Let

[formula]

be the natural homomorphism. Then N  ≤  CG(A / B), [formula], [formula], and [formula].

Proof.  The inclusion N  ≤  CG(A / B) is true since the product of M and N is direct. The inclusions [formula] and [formula] are evident. We need to show the reverse inclusions in order to complete the proof.

Let [formula] for some x∈G. Then AxN = AN and BxN = BN. Since [formula], then Ax  ≤  M and Bx  ≤  M. Applying the coordinate projection map M  ×  N  →  M to both parts of the equalities AxN = AN and BxN = BN, we obtain Ax = A and Bx = B. It follows that x∈NG(A / B), and consequently we obtain the inclusion [formula].

Let [formula]. Then for every a∈A there exist b∈B, g∈N such that ax = bag. Since ax∈A and A,B  ≤  M, the projection M  ×  N  →  M with kernel N leaves ax stable, and at the same time maps it into ba. Therefore ax = ba. Thus [formula].

The following lemma is known and its proof can be found in [\cite=RevVdoArxive], for example.

Let A be a normal Eπ-subgroup of G such that G / A is a π-group, and M a π-Hall subgroup of A. Then there exists a π-Hall subgroup H of G satisfying [formula] if and only if the set {Ma|a∈A} is closed under conjugation by G.

An extension of an Eπ-group by an Eπ-group may fail to possess a π-Hall subgroup, as is shown in the following known example.

Let π  =  {2,3}, [formula] be a group of order 168 = 23  ·  3  ·  7. From [\cite=RevHallp] it follows that G has exactly two classes of π-Hall subgroups with representatives

[formula]

The first consists of line stabilizers in the natural representation of G, and the second consists of plain stabilizers. The map ι:x∈G  ↦  (xt)- 1, where xt denotes the transpose of the matrix x, is an automorphism of order 2 of G. It interchanges classes of π-Hall subgroups, hence by Proposition [\ref=base] and Lemma [\ref=HallExist] the natural extension [formula] does not possess a π-Hall subgroup.

The following example shows that a normal subgroup of an Eπ-group may possess π-Hall subgroups that are not contained in a π-Hall subgroup of the whole group.

Let π  =  {2,3}. Let [formula] be a group of order 99999360 = 210  ·  32  ·  5  ·  7  ·  31. Let ι:x∈G  ↦  (xt)- 1 and [formula] be a natural semidirect product. From [\cite=RevHallp] it follows that there exist π-Hall subgroups of G, and every such a subgroup is a stabilizer of a series of subspaces V = V0 < V1 < V2 < V3 = V, where V is the natural module of G, and dim Vk / Vk - 1∈{1,2} for k = 1,2,3. Therefore, there are three conjugacy classes of π-Hall subgroups of G with representatives

[formula]

[formula]

Note that NG(Hk) = Hk, k = 1,2,3, since Hk is parabolic. The class containing H1 is ι-invariant. So the Frattini argument implies that Ĝ = GNĜ(H1), whence |NĜ(H1):NG(H1)| = 2 and NĜ(H1) is a π-Hall subgroup of Ĝ. Moreover ι interchanges classes containing H2 and H3. So, as in the previous example, these subgroups are not contained in π-Hall subgroups of Ĝ.

Proof of the Main Theorem and Corollaries

Proof of Lemma [\ref=EpiCyclic]. Suppose that S is a finite simple Eπ-group and G is chosen so that [formula] and [formula]. Assume also that for every proper subgroup M of G with S  ≤  M we have M∈Eπ, i.e., G is a minimal subgroup of [formula] containing S subject to [formula].

Notice that G / S is a π-group. Indeed, by the Schreier conjecture [formula] is solvable, hence it satisfies Dπ. Consider a π-Hall subgroup M / S of G / S. If G / S is not a π-group, then M is a proper subgroup of G, hence it satisfies Eπ in view of the minimality of G. So there exists a π-Hall subgroup H of M. Since |G:M|  =  |(G / S):(M / S)| and M / S is a π-Hall subgroup of G / S, we obtain that |G:M| is a π'-number, so H is a π-Hall subgroup of G. This contradicts [formula].

We have that G, acting by conjugation, permutes elements of Kπ(S), so we obtain a homomorphism [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=HallExist] we obtain that [formula] if and only if G does not leave invariant any conjugacy class of π-Hall subgroups of S, i.e., Gφ is a subgroup of [formula] acting without stable points.

If [formula], then by [\cite=GroConjOddOrder], S∈Cπ, so [formula] has a stable point and this case is impossible.

If [formula] then [\cite=RevVdoDpiFinal] implies that S always possesses an [formula]-invariant class of conjugate π-Hall subgroups, so again G has a stable point on Kπ(S) and this case is impossible.

Suppose that 2,3∈π. Then [\cite=RevVdoArxive] implies that either kπ(S)∈{1,2,3,4}, or kπ(S) = 9. As in the case [formula] we see, that kπ(S) = 1 is impossible. By [\cite=RevVdoArxive] we obtain that if kπ(S) = 9, then S possesses an [formula]-invariant conjugacy class of π-Hall subgroup, hence G has a stable point on Kπ(S). So we may assume that [formula].

Assume that kπ(S) = 2 and [formula]. Then [formula], so there exists an element x∈G such that xφ = (1,2). Clearly we may assume that the order of x is a power of 2. By Lemma [\ref=HallExist] we obtain [formula].

Assume that kπ(S) = 3. Since G has no fixed points on Kπ(G), it acts transitively on Kπ(S), so there exists an element x∈G such that xφ = (1,2,3). Clearly we may assume that the order of x is a power of 3. By Lemma [\ref=HallExist] we obtain [formula].

Assume finally that kπ(S) = 4. Then Gφ, as a subgroup of [formula], acts without fixed points. Now every subgroup of [formula] that does not fix a point contains an element of type (i,j)(k,l). Consider an element x∈G in the preimage of such an element (i,j)(k,l) under the homomorphism [formula]. Since |(i,j)(k,l)| = 2, we can choose x of order a power of 2. Furthermore x stabilizes no class of conjugate π-Hall subgroups of S, hence by Proposition [\ref=base] and Lemma [\ref=HallExist], the group 〈x,S〉 has no π-Hall subgroups.

Note. Using the classification of π-Hall subgroups it is possible to show that if kπ(S) = 3, then S possesses an [formula]-invariant class of conjugate π-Hall subgroups. So the element x from Lemma [\ref=EpiCyclic] may be chosen to be a 2-element. However this fact needs a rather complicated analysis of simple Eπ-groups with 3 conjugacy classes of π-Hall subgroup and we do not give it here.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=ExistenceCriterion]. Assume by contradiction that G is an Eπ-group, with composition series [formula], and that [formula] for some i. If Gi / Gi - 1 is Abelian, then [formula] is cyclic. Since

[formula]

we obtain that [formula]. Thus Gi / Gi - 1 is non-abelian. By Lemma [\ref=EpiCyclic] we have that [formula] and there exists [formula] such that [formula] and the order of x is either a power of 2, or a power of 3. Let y∈NG(Gi / Gi - 1) be a preimage of x; it may be chosen to be a 2-element or a 3-element. By Sylow's theorem there exists a π-Hall subgroup H of G such that y∈H. By Proposition [\ref=base], [formula] is a π-Hall subgroup of Gi / Gi - 1. Moreover in view of the choice of y we have [formula], hence x (as the image of y in NG(Gi / Gi - 1) / CG(Gi / Gi - 1)) normalizes a π-Hall subgroup [formula] of Gi / Gi - 1. By Lemma [\ref=HallExist] we obtain that 〈x,Gi / Gi - 1〉∈Eπ, a contradiction.

Now we are able to prove the corollaries.

Proof of Corollary [\ref=SubDirectProduct]. It is enough to prove that if G is a finite group with normal subgroups M,N such that [formula] and G / M,G / N∈Eπ, then G∈Eπ. Clearly we may assume that both M and N are proper subgroups of G. Let [formula] be a composition series of G which is a refinement of a chief series of G through M. If Gi > M, then the condition G / M∈Eπ and Theorem [\ref=ExistenceCriterion] imply that [formula]. If Gi  ≤  M, then the condition [formula] and Lemma [\ref=InducedAutomorphism] imply that [formula]. Condition G / N∈Eπ and Theorem [\ref=ExistenceCriterion] imply that [formula]. Therefore by Corollary [\ref=GrossExistenceCriterionImproved] we obtain that G∈Eπ.

Proof of Corollary [\ref=HomomorphicImage]. Let G∈Eπ, [formula] and M / A be a π-Hall subgroup of G / A. Let [formula] be a composition series of G which is a refinement of a chief series of G through A, so Gn = A for some n. Let [formula] be a composition series which is a refinement of a chief series of M / A. Then

[formula]

is a composition series of M which is a refinement of a chief series of M. Since M / A is a π-group, then, for each i > n, [formula] satisfies Eπ. For every non-Abelian composition factor Gi / Gi - 1 with [formula] we have that

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=ExistenceCriterion], [formula] satisfies Eπ and [\cite=GrossExistence] implies that [formula] satisfies Eπ. By Theorem [\ref=GrossExistenceCriterion], M satisfies Eπ. Hence there exists a π-Hall subgroup H of M and H is a π-Hall subgroup of G. Since M / A is a π-group, then M  /  A  =  HA  /  A.
