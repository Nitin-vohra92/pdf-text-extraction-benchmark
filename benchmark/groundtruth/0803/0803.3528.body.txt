Parametrization of Bose-Einstein Correlations and Reconstruction of the Space-Time Evolution of Pion Production in e+e- Annihilation

Present address: Dept. of Business Mathematics, Károly Róbert College, H-3200 Gyöngyös, Hungary

Introduction

In particle and nuclear physics, intensity interferometry provides a direct experimental method for the determination of sizes, shapes and lifetimes of particle-emitting sources (for reviews see, e.g., [\cite=Gyulassy:1979] [\cite=Boal:1990] [\cite=Baym:1998] [\cite=Wolfram:Zako2001] [\cite=Tamas:HIP2002]). In particular, boson interferometry provides a powerful tool for the investigation of the space-time structure of particle production processes, since Bose-Einstein correlations (BEC) of two identical bosons reflect both geometrical and dynamical properties of the particle radiating source. Given the point-like nature of the underlying interaction,  annihilation provides an ideal environment to study these properties in multiparticle production by quark fragmentation.

Bose-Einstein Correlation Function

The two-particle correlation function of two particles with four-momenta p1 and p2 is given by the ratio of the two-particle number density, ρ2(p1,p2), to the product of the two single-particle number densities, ρ1(p1)ρ1(p2). Being only interested in the correlation R2 due to Bose-Einstein interference, the product of single-particle densities is replaced by ρ0(p1,p2), the two-particle density that would occur in the absence of Bose-Einstein correlations:

[formula]

Since the mass of the two identical particles of the pair is fixed to the pion mass, the correlation function is defined in six-dimensional momentum space. Since Bose-Einstein correlations can be large only at small four-momentum difference [formula], they are often parametrized in terms of this one-dimensional distance measure. There is no reason, however, to expect the hadron source for jet fragmentation to be spherically symmetric. Recent investigations, using the Bertsch-Pratt parametrization [\cite=Pratt:86] [\cite=Bertsch:88], have, in fact, found an elongation of the source along the jet axis [\cite=L3_3D:1999] [\cite=OPAL3D:2000] [\cite=DELPHI2D:2000] [\cite=ALEPH:2004] [\cite=OPAL:2007] in the longitudinal center-of-mass (LCMS) frame [\cite=tamas:workshop91]. While this effect is well established, the elongation is actually only about 20%, which suggests that a parametrization in terms of the single variable Q, may be a good approximation.

There have been indications that the size of the source, as measured using BEC, depends on the transverse mass, [formula], of the pions [\cite=Smirnova:Nijm96] [\cite=Dalen:Maha98] [\cite=OPAL:2007]. It has been shown [\cite=Bialas:1999] [\cite=Bialas:2000] that such a dependence can be understood if the produced pions satisfy, approximately, the (generalized) Bjorken-Gottfried condition [\cite=Gottfried:1972] [\cite=Bjorken:SLAC73] [\cite=Bjorken:1973] [\cite=Gottfried:1974] [\cite=Low:1978] [\cite=Bjorken:ISMD94], whereby the four-momentum of a produced particle and the space-time position at which it is produced are linearly related: x  =  dp. Such a correlation between space-time and momentum-energy is also a feature of the Lund string model as incorporated in Jetset [\cite=JETSET74], which is very successful in describing detailed features of the hadronic final states of  annihilation. Recently, experimental support for this strong correlation has been found [\cite=OPAL:2007].

A model which predicts both a Q- and an -dependence while incorporating the Bjorken-Gottfried condition is the so-called τ-model [\cite=Tamas;Zimanji:1990]. In this article we develop this model further and apply it to the reconstruction of the space-time evolution of pion production in  annihilation.

BEC in the model

In the τ-model, it is assumed that the average production point in the overall center-of-mass system, [formula], of particles with a given four-momentum p is given by

[formula]

In the case of two-jet events, [formula] where  is the transverse mass and [formula] is the longitudinal proper time. For isotropically distributed particle production, the transverse mass is replaced by the mass in the definition of a and τ is the proper time. In the case of three-jet events the relation is more complicated.

The correlation between coordinate space and momentum space variables is described by the distribution of x(p) about its average by [formula]. The emission function of the τ-model is then given by [\cite=Tamas;Zimanji:1990]

[formula]

where H(τ) is the (longitudinal) proper-time distribution and ρ1(p) is the experimentally measurable single-particle momentum spectrum, both H(τ) and ρ1(p) being normalized to unity.

The two-pion distribution, ρ2(p1,p2), is related to S(x,p), in the plane-wave approximation, by the Yano-Koonin formula [\cite=Yano]:

[formula]

Assuming that the distribution of x(p) about its average is much narrower than the proper-time distribution, Eq. ([\ref=eq:yano]) can be evaluated in a saddle-point approximation. Approximating the function δΔ by a Dirac delta function yields the same result. Thus the integral of Eq. ([\ref=eq:source]) becomes

[formula]

and the argument of the cosine in Eq. ([\ref=eq:yano]) becomes

[formula]

Substituting Eqs. ([\ref=eq:S]) and ([\ref=eq:cos]) in Eq. ([\ref=eq:yano]) leads to the following approximation of the two-particle Bose-Einstein correlation function:

[formula]

where [formula] is the Fourier transform of H(τ).

This formula simplifies further if R2 is measured with the restriction

[formula]

In that case, R2 becomes

[formula]

Thus for a given average of a of the two particles, R2 is found to depend only on the invariant relative momentum Q. Further, the model predicts a specific dependence on ā, which for two-jet events is a specific dependence on [formula].

Since there is no particle production before the onset of the collision, H(τ) should be a one-sided distribution. We choose a one-sided Lévy distribution, which has the characteristic function (Fourier transform) [\cite=Tamas:Levy2004] (for [formula])

[formula]

where the parameter τ0 is the proper time of the onset of particle production and Δτ is a measure of the width of the proper-time distribution. Using this characteristic function in Eq. ([\ref=eq:levyR2a]) yields

[formula]

which for two-jet events is

[formula]

We now consider a simplification of the equation obtained by assuming (a) that particle production starts immediately, i.e., τ0 = 0, and (b) an average a-dependence, which is implemented in an approximate way by defining an effective radius, [formula], which for 2-jet events becomes [formula]. This results in:

[formula]

where [formula] is related to R by

[formula]

To illustrate that Eq. ([\ref=eq:asymlevR2]) can provide a reasonable parametrization, we show in Fig. [\ref=fig:a_levy] a fit of Eq. ([\ref=eq:asymlevR2]) with [formula] a free parameter to Z-boson decays generated by Pythia [\cite=PYTHIAsix] with BEC simulated by the BE algorithm [\cite=LS98] as tuned to l 3 data [\cite=L3:QCDphysrep]. In particular, it describes well the dip in R2 below unity in the Q-region 0.5-1.5 , unlike the usual Gaussian or exponential parametrizations. While generalizations [\cite=tamas:edge:lag00] of the Gaussian by an Edgeworth expansion and of the exponential by a Laguerre expansion can describe the dip, they require more additional parameters than Eq. ([\ref=eq:asymlevR2]). Recently the l 3 Collaboration has presented preliminary results showing that Eq. ([\ref=eq:asymlevR2]) describes their data on hadronic Z decay [\cite=wes:WPCF2006].

The emission function of two-jet events

Within the framework of the τ-model, we now show how to reconstruct the space-time picture of pion emission. We restrict ourselves to two-jet events where we know what a is, namely [formula]. The emission function in configuration space, [formula], is the proper time derivative of the integral over p of S(x,p), which in the τ-model is given by Eq. ([\ref=eq:source]). Approximating δΔ by a Dirac delta function, we find

[formula]

where n and n̄ are the number and average number of pions produced, respectively.

Given the symmetry of two-jet events, [formula] does not depend on the azimuthal angle, and we can write it in cylindrical coordinates as

[formula]

where η is the space-time rapidity. With the strongly correlated phase-space of the τ-model, η = y and [formula]. Consequently,

[formula]

where [formula] is the joint single-particle distribution of  and y.

The reconstruction of [formula] is simplified if [formula] can be factorized in the product of the single-particle  and rapidity distributions, i.e., [formula]. Then Eq. ([\ref=eq:Preta]) becomes

[formula]

The transverse part of the emission function is obtained by integrating over z as well as azimuthal angle. Pictures of this function evaluated at successive times would together form a movie revealing the time evolution of particle production in 2-jet events in  annihilation.

To summarize: Within the τ-model, H(τ) is obtained from a fit of Eq. ([\ref=eq:levy2jetR2av]) to the Bose-Einstein correlation function. From H(τ) together with the inclusive distribution of rapidity and , the full emission function in configuration space, [formula], can then be reconstructed.
