A characterization of surfaces whose universal cover is the bidisk

Introduction

The beauty of the theory of algebraic curves is deeply related to the manifold implications of the:

([formula] denotes as usual the Poincaré upper half-plane [formula], but we shall often refer to it as the 'disk' since it is biholomorphic to [formula]).

Hence a smooth (connected) compact complex curve C of genus g  ≥  1 admits a uniformization in the strong sense (iii) of the following definition:

Hence the universal cover of a compact complex curve is completely determined by its genus; in particular [formula] if and only if g  ≥  2, i.e., "C is of general type", and we get then an isomorphism of π1(C) with a Fuchsian group [formula].

In higher dimension the condition that the universal cover be biholomorphic to a bounded domain Ω is quite exceptional; but still in the Galois étale case, where [formula] and Γ acts freely with compact quotient, we have, if Ω is bounded, that the complex manifold X has ample canonical bundle KX (see [\cite=siegel]), in particular it is a projective manifold of general type.

Even more exceptional is the case where the universal cover is biholomorphic to a bounded symmetric domain Ω, or where there is Galois uniformization (ii) of definition [\ref=unif]) with source a bounded symmetric domain, and there is a vast literature on a characterization of these properties (cf. [\cite=Yau], [\cite=yau1], [\cite=yau], [\cite=Bea]).

The basic result in this direction is S.T. Yau's uniformization theorem (explained in [\cite=yau1] and [\cite=yau]), and for which a very readable exposition is contained in the first section of [\cite=vz], enphasyzing the role of polystability of the cotangent bundle for varieties of general type. One would wish nevertheless for more precise characterizations of the various possible cases.

For the sake of simplicity, we shall stick here to the case of smooth complex surfaces, where the former problem boils down to two very specific questions.

When is the universal cover of a compact complex surface X biholomorphic to the two dimensional ball [formula], respectively to the bidisk [formula] ?

The first part of this question is fully answered by the well-known inequality by Miyaoka and Yau (cf. [\cite=Miy], [\cite=Yau] [\cite=miy]). Setting, as usual, KX  =   the canonical divisor, [formula] the holomorphic Euler characteristic and P2(X) = h0(X,2KX) the second plurigenus of X, we have the following characterization:

The above well known characterization is obtained combining Miyaoka's result ([\cite=miy]) that these two conditions imply the ampleness of KX, with Yau's uniformization result ([\cite=Yau]) which uses the existence of a Kähler Einstein metric; quite remarkably, it is given purely in terms of certain numbers which are either bimeromorphic or topological invariants.

In the case where [formula], with Γ a discrete cocompact subgroup of [formula] acting freely, one has K2X = 8χ(X).

But Moishezon and Teicher in [\cite=MT] showed the existence of a simply connected surface of general type (whence with P2(X) > 0) having K2X = 8χ(X), so that the above conditions are necessary, but not sufficient. We observe however that (and our contribution here is a by-product of our attempt to answer the latter question) it is still unknown if there exists a surface of general type with χ(X) = 1,K2X = 8 which is not uniformized by [formula].

The purpose of this note is to point out a precise characterization of compact complex surfaces whose universal cover is the bidisk, and of the quadric [formula], discussing whether some hypotheses can be dispensed with, and to pose an analogous question in higher dimension. Our characterization, which is of course based on Yau's results, relies on the following crucial

In fact, the existence of such tensors is a fundamental property of manifolds strongly uniformized by the polydisk as we are now going to see.

Recall that the group of automorphism of [formula], [formula], is the semidirect product of [formula] with the symmetric group [formula], hence for every subgroup Γ of [formula] we have a diagram:

[formula]

Let [formula] be a compact complex manifold whose universal covering is the polydisk [formula]: then X admits a semi special tensor and KX is ample, in particular KnX  >  0.

In [formula] take coordinates [formula] and define

[formula]

Observe that [formula] is clearly invariant for [formula] and for the alternating subgroup. Let η be the 2-torsion invertible sheaf associated to the signature character of [formula] restricted to H. Then clearly [formula] descends to a semi special tensor [formula].

The other assertions are well known (cf. [\cite=siegel] and [\cite=k=m]).

In dimension two we have then the following

In particular one has the following reformulation of a theorem of S.T. Yau (theorem 2.5 of [\cite=yau], giving sufficient conditions for (ii) to hold).

One can indeed be even more precise:

It is interesting to see that none of the above hypotheses can be dispensed with.

The most intriguing examples are provided by

There do exist properly elliptic surfaces X satisfying

(1) X admits a special tensor;

(3*) the second plurigenus P2(X)  ≥  2;

[formula];

K2X  =  0;

X is not birational to a product.

We would like to pose then the following

Question.   Let X be a surface with q(X) = 0 and satisfying (1*) and (3*): is then X strongly uniformized by the bidisk?

Concerning the above question, recall the following

For n = 2 there are then only two alternatives:

Let us try to explain the main idea of our main result. In order to do this, it is important to make the following

Assume that we have an invertible sheaf η such that [formula], [formula]. Take the corresponding double connected étale covering [formula] and observe that

[formula]

Whence, there is a special tensor on X' if and only if there is a semi special tensor on X.

In dimension n = 2 things are easier, since the existence of a special tensor ω is equivalent to the existence of a trace free endomorphism ε of the tangent bundle of X.

Our proof of Theorem [\ref=unibidisk] consists essentially in finding a decomposition of the tangent bundle TX as a direct sum of two line bundles L1 and L2, which are the eigenbundles of an invertible endomorphism [formula] (see § 2 and § 3 for details), and then applying the results on surfaces with split tangent bundles as given in [\cite=Bea].

Since the results on manifolds with split tangent bundles hold in dimension n  ≥  3, one has a characterization of compact manifolds strongly uniformized by the polydisk under a very strong condition on the semi special tensor [formula], which essentially corresponds to ask for the local splitting of ω as the product of n 1-forms which are linearly independent at each point. There remains the problem of finding a simpler characterization.

Preliminaries and remarks

X denotes throughout a compact complex surface. We use standard notation of algebraic geometry: Ω1X is the cotangent sheaf, TX is the holomorphic tangent bundle (locally free sheaf), c1(X), c2(X) are the Chern classes of X; KX is the canonical divisor, and Pn: = h0(X,nKX) is called the n-th plurigenus, in particular for n = 1 we have the geometric genus of X pg(X):  =  h0(X,KX), while [formula] is classically called the irregularity of X. Finally, [formula] is the holomorphic Euler characteristic.

With a slight abuse of notation, we do not distinguish between invertible sheaves, line bundles and divisors, while the symbol [formula] denotes linear equivalence of divisors.

First of all let us recall a result of Beauville which characterizes compact complex surfaces whose universal cover is a product of two complex curves (cf. [\cite=Bea]).

Given a direct sum decomposition of the cotangent bundle [formula], Beauville shows that (L1)2 = (L2)2 = 0 (cf. [\cite=Bea]) hence

[formula]

The last equality corresponds to K2X  =  8χ(X).

Let us now consider the bundle [formula] of endomorphisms of the tangent bundle. We can write [formula] and from the nondegenerate bilinear map

[formula]

we see that [formula]. This exactly means that we have an isomorphism [formula]

Let us see how this isomorphism works in local coordinates (z1,z2). I.e., let us see how an element [formula] in [formula] acts on a vector of the form [formula]. We have

[formula]

In turn, [formula] evaluated on [formula] gives [formula].

Therefore a generic element [formula] corresponds to an endomorphism, which, with respect to the basis [formula] is expressed by the matrix

[formula]

In particular for the symmetric tensors (i.e., a12  =  a21), respectively for the skewsymmetric tensors (i.e., a12 =  - a21,a11 = a22 = 0) the following isomorphisms hold:

[formula]

We can summarize the above discussion in the following

If X is a complex surface there is a natural isomorphism between the sheaf S2(Ω1X)( - KX) and the sheaf of trace zero endomorphisms of the (co)tangent sheaf [formula].

A special tensor ω∈H0(S2(Ω1X)( - KX)) with nonzero determinant [formula] yields an eigenbundle splitting [formula] of the cotangent bundle.

If instead [formula], the corresponding endomorphism ε is nilpotent and yields an exact sequence of sheaves

[formula]

where L:  =   ker (ε) is invertible, Δ is an effective divisor, and Z is a 0-dimensional subscheme(which is a local complete intersection).

We have in particular [formula] and c2(X) = length(Z)  +  L  ·  (L - Δ).

Proof. We need only to observe that  det (ω) is a constant, since [formula].

If  det (ω)  ≠  0, there is a constant [formula] such that  det (ω)  =  c2, hence at every point of X the endomorphism ε corresponding to the special tensor ω has two distinct eigenvalues   ±  c.

Let ω∈H0(S2Ω1X( - KX)), ω  ≠  0, be such that det (ω) = 0. Then the corresponding endomorphism ε is nilpotent of order 2, and there exists an open nonempty subset U  ⊆  X such that [formula]. At a point p where [formula], in local coordinates the endomorphism ε may be expressed by

[formula]

Let [formula]. After dividing by δ, every prime factor of a is either not in b, or not in c, thus we can write

[formula]

Therefore we obtain

[formula]

and, writing our endomorphism ε as ε  =  δ  ·  α, we have

[formula]

Let Z be the 0-dimensional scheme defined by {β  =  γ = 0} and Δ be the Cartier divisor defined by {δ = 0}.

From the above description we deduce that the kernel of ε is a line bundle L which fits in the following exact sequence:

[formula]

Taking the total Chern classes we infer that: [formula] as divisors on X and c2(X) = length(Z)  +  L  ·  (L - Δ).

Let X be a complex surface and let X' be the blow up of X at a point p. Then a special tensor ω' on X' induces a special tensor ω on X, and the converse only holds if and only if ω vanishes at p (in particular, it must hold : det (ω)  =  0).

Proof. First of all, ω' induces a special tensor on [formula], and by Hartogs' theorem the latter extends to a special tensor ω on X.

Conversely, choose local coordinates (x,y) for X around p and take a local chart of the blow up with coordinates (x,u) where y = ux. Locally around p we can write

[formula]

The pull back ω' of ω is given by the following expression:

[formula]

[formula]

hence ω' is regular if and only if [formula] is a regular function.

This is obvious if a,b,c vanish at p, since then their pull back is divisible by x. Assume on the other side that a,b,c are constant: then we get a rational function which is only regular if a  =  b  =  c  =  0.

Let X be a compact minimal rational surface admitting a special tensor ω. Then [formula] if det (ω)  ≠  0.

Proof. Assume that X is a [formula] bundle over a curve [formula], i.e., a ruled surface [formula] with n  ≥  0. Let [formula] the projection.

By the exact sequence

[formula]

and since on a general fibre F the subsheaf π*Ω1B is trivial, while the quotient sheaf Ω1X|B is negative, we conclude that any endomorphism ε carries π*Ω1B to itself. If it has non zero determinant we can conclude by Theorem [\ref=teo:beauville] that [formula]. Otherwise, ε is nilpotent and we have a nonzero element in Hom(Ω1X|B,π*Ω1B).

Since these are invertible sheaves, it suffices to see when

[formula]

But, letting Σ be the section with selfintersection Σ2  =   - n, our vector space equals [formula] Intersecting this divisor with Σ we see that (since each time the intersection number with Σ is negative) [formula]

There remains the case where X is [formula].

In this case ε must be a nilpotent endomorphism by Theorem [\ref=teo:beauville], and it cannot vanish at any point by our previous result on [formula]. Therefore the rank of ε equals 1 at each point. By lemma [\ref=split] it follows that there is a divisor L such that KX  =  2L, a contradiction.

Proof of Theorems [\ref=unibidisk] and [\ref=sharp]

If X is strongly uniformized by the bidisk, then KX is ample, in particular K2X  ≥  1 and, since by Castelnuovo's theorem χ(X)  ≥  1, by the vanishing theorem of Kodaira and Mumford it follows that P2(X)  ≥  2 (see [\cite=cm]).

Thus one direction follows from proposition [\ref=nec], except that we shall show only later that (1*) holds.

Assume conversely that (1),(2) hold. Without loss of generality we may assume by lemma [\ref=blowup] that X is minimal, since K2X can only decrease via a blowup and the bigenus is a birational invariant.

K2X  ≥  1 implies that either the surface X is of general type, or it is a rational surface. In the latter case we conclude by lemma [\ref=rational].

Observe that the further hypothesis (3) (obviously implied by (3*)) guarantees that X is of general type.

Thus, from now on, we may assume that X is of general type and, passing to an étale double cover if necessary, that X admits a special tensor.

By the cited Theorem [\ref=teo:beauville] of [\cite=Bea] it suffices to find a decomposition of the cotangent bundle Ω1X as a direct sum of two line bundles L1 and L2.

The two line bundles L1, L2 will be given as eigenbundles of a diagonizable endomorphism [formula].

Our previous discussion shows then that it is sufficient to show that any special tensor cannot yield a nilpotent endomorphism.

Otherwise, by lemma [\ref=split], we can write [formula] and then deduce that L is a big divisor since Δ is effective by construction and KX is big because X is of general type. This assertion gives the required contradiction since by the Bogomolov-Castelnuovo-de Franchis Theorem (cf. [\cite=Bog]) for an invertible subsheaf L of Ω1X it is h0(X,mL)  ≤  O(m), contradicting the bigness of L.

There remains to show (1*). But if h0(X,S2Ω1X( - KX))  ≥  2 then, given a point p∈X, there is a special tensor which is not invertible in p, hence a special tensor with vanishing determinant, a contradiction.

Proof of proposition [\ref=elliptic]

In this section we consider surfaces X with bigenus P2(X)  ≥  2 (property (3*)), therefore their Kodaira dimension equals 1 or 2, hence either they are properly (canonically) elliptic, or they are of general type.

Since we took already care of the latter case in the main theorems [\ref=unibidisk] and [\ref=sharp], we restrict our attention here to the former case, and try to see when does a properly elliptic surface admit a special tensor (we can reduce to this situation in view of remark [\ref=double]). We can moreover assume that the associated endomorphism ε is nilpotent by theorem [\ref=teo:beauville].

Again without loss of generality we may assume that X is minimal by virtue of lemma [\ref=blowup].

Proof. Let X be a minimal properly elliptic surface and let [formula] be its (multi)canonical elliptic fibration. Write any fibre f- 1(p) as [formula] and, setting np:  =  G.C.D.(mi), Fp  =  npF'p, we say that a fibre is multiple if np  >  1. By Kodaira's classification ([\cite=Kodaira]) of the singular fibres we know that in this case [formula]

Assume that the multiple fibres of the elliptic fibration are [formula], and consider the divisorial part of the critical locus

[formula]

so that we have then the exact sequence

[formula]

where C is a 0-dimensional (l.c.i.) subscheme.

For further calculations we separate the divisorial part of the critical locus as the sum of two disjoint effective divisors, the multiple fibre contribution and the rest:

[formula]

Let us assume that we have a nilpotent endomorphism corresponding to another exact sequence

[formula]

in turn determined by a homomorphism

[formula]

i.e., by a section

[formula]

[formula]

We observe that, since [formula], it follows that, if F is a general fibre, then

[formula]

hence the effective divisor Δ is contained in a finite union of fibres.

The first candidate to try with is the choice of L  =  L', where we set [formula].

To this purpose we recall Kodaira's canonical bundle formula:

[formula]

where b is the genus of the base curve B.

Then [formula], and we search for an effective divisor linearly equivalent to

[formula]

We claim that [formula]: it will then suffice to have examples where [formula]

Proof of the claim

It suffices to show that [formula]. Since the divisor [formula] is supported on the singular fibres, and it is effective, we have to show that, for each singular fibre [formula], neither 2p  ≥  Fp nor [formula].

The latter case is obvious since [formula].

In the former case, [formula], but it is not possible that [formula] one has 2(mi - 1)  ≥  mi, since there is always an irreducible curve Ci with multiplicity mi  =  1.

Q.E.D. for the claim

Assume that the elliptic fibration is not a product (in this case there is no special tensor with vanishing determinant): then the irregularity of X equals the genus of B, whence our divisor on the curve B has degree equal to 2b - 2  -  (1 - b  +  pg(X))  =  3b - 3  -  pg.

Since χ(X)  ≥  1, pg:  =  pg(X)  ≥  b, and there exist an elliptic surface X with any pg  ≥  b ([\cite=qed]).

Since any divisor on B of degree ≥  b is effective, it suffices to choose b  ≤  pg  ≤  2b - 3 and we get a special tensor with trivial determinant, provided that b  ≥  3.

Take now a Jacobian elliptic surface in Weierstrass normal form

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], and assume that all the fibres are irreducible.

Then the space of special tensors corresponding to our choice of L corresponds to the vector space [formula]. It suffices to take a hyperelliptic curve B of genus b  =  6h  +  1, and, denoting by H the hyperelliptic divisor, set M:  =  hH, so that [formula] and we have [formula]. We leave aside for the time being the question whether the surface X admits a unique special tensor.
