Low-energy excitations of a boson pair in a double-well trap

Introduction

Ensembles of ultracold, trapped atoms provide an ideal test system for the study of fundamental quantum principles. The manipulation of atoms with photons, [\cite=coh98], has given rise to the experimental realization of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) [\cite=and95] [\cite=dav95] [\cite=dal99] and, more recently, the trapping and manipulation of condensates using optical lattice potentials [\cite=and98] [\cite=cat01] [\cite=bloA05] [\cite=bloB05]. The weak coupling of neutral atoms to their environment mean that this system of cold neutral atoms, confined by a periodic potential, may prove useful in the investigation of primitive quantum information processing [\cite=mon02]. Indeed, such systems have already been used to carry out a two-qubit entangling operation [\cite=jak99] [\cite=man03], thereby realizing the crucial CNOT gate. At the same time, the spatially periodic nature of the system makes it ideal for the detailed study of solid-state Hamiltonians [\cite=fis89] [\cite=jak98] [\cite=gre02]. The benefit of this artificial system, in this regard, lies in the fact that the experimentalist can easily vary external control parameters (e.g. laser intensity or wavelength), thereby varying particular parameters of the system Hamiltonian. A degree of control that is not generally afforded to typical solid-state systems.

The dynamics of a system of ultracold atoms, confined by an optical lattice potential, can be accurately described within the framework of the Bose-Hubbard model [\cite=fis89] [\cite=jak98]. In this model the system Hamiltonian is parameterized by the tunnelling strength between adjacent lattice sites, J, and the on-site interaction energy, U. The Hamiltonian describing the system dynamics can then be written as

[formula]

where [formula] is the annihilation (creation) operator for an atom at the lattice site i and [formula] is the number operator for that site. Parameter εi is the single-particle energy at lattice site i and will vary with i for an inhomogeneous lattice. Implicit in this model is the assumption that the dynamics of the system is dominated by single- and two-particle effects. In this way, the system of two, confined, interacting particles represents the fundamental building block for the understanding of these many-body systems. Furthermore, continual advancement in optical lattice technology means that it has become possible to confine small numbers of atoms (e.g. 1 or 2) at individual lattice sites, effectively realizing a system of two trapped atoms.

For low-energy collisions the particle interactions can be accurately represented within the pseudopotential approximation [\cite=hua_st]. The eigenstates for a system of two particles, interacting via a pseudopotential, can be determined analytically for both isotropic [\cite=bus98] and anisotropic [\cite=idz05] harmonic traps. Under such confinement, the 'free-space' pseudopotential approximation is found to be sufficiently accurate provided the length scale associated with the particle-particle interactions (a) is short compared to the length scale of the confining potential (L) [\cite=blo02]. For the case in which a and L are comparable, one may introduce an energy-dependent scattering length and solve for the eigenenergies of the system self-consistently [\cite=tie00] [\cite=bol02] [\cite=bol03].

In addition to providing small numbers of particles at individual lattice sites, optical lattice experiments also allow for the realization of quasi-one and -two dimensional systems [\cite=kin04] [\cite=par04]. Simply increasing the confining potential steeply in one or two of the transverse directions will effectively 'freeze out' the corresponding degrees of freedom [\cite=ket96] [\cite=gor01]. Such systems of reduced dimensionality can also be achieved using optical or magnetic atom waveguides. The theoretical treatment of the particle-particle interactions in such low-dimensional geometries has been previously considered. For a quasi-one dimensional (quasi-1D) system it was found that the scattering could be treated in terms of a 1D, zero-ranged δ-potential, renormalized according to the confining potential [\cite=ols98]. The physical realization of such quasi-1D trap geometries and recent advances in the tuning of atomic interactions using Feshbach resonances have permitted the study of previously inaccessible regimes. Notably, the 1D system of impenetrable bosons, or so-called Tonks-Girardeau gas [\cite=ton36] [\cite=gir60], has commanded considerable experimental [\cite=kin04] [\cite=par04] and theoretical [\cite=yuk05] [\cite=gir00] [\cite=gir01] [\cite=bus03] [\cite=lin07] [\cite=murA07] interest in recent years.

In [\cite=murA07] the detailed theoretical study of two interacting particles in a δ-split harmonic potential was considered. The DVR techniques, [\cite=bay86] [\cite=lig00], employed in [\cite=murA07] to study the δ-split trap potential can be easily adapted to other types of confining potentials. In the current article we utilize these same numerical techniques to study a prototypical two-well trap, defined by [formula]. The eigenspectrum for this two-particle system is studied and properties of the ground and lowest excited states are investigated for varying of the barrier height (dictated by κ) and the strength of the particle-particle interactions. Particular consideration is given to the similarities observed between the the ground state structure in this prototypical two-well potential and that of the δ-split potential [\cite=murA07].

Similar numerical studies of ultracold few-boson systems have been recently reported [\cite=zolA06] [\cite=zolB06] [\cite=zol07]. In this work the authors use a multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method to study systems of several bosons in a double-well trap, with narrow width Gaussians used to represent both the central splitting potential and the interparticle potential. Where comparison is possible, the results of this numerical MCTDH study demonstrate qualitative similarity to the results of the present study.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. [\ref=sect:system_hamiltonian] we outline the Hamiltonian that shall be considered, for two particles confined by a quasi-1D double well potential. In Sec. [\ref=sect:energy_spec] we present the energy level spectrum for the single and two-particle systems, illustrating how the spectrum is influenced by barrier height and interaction strength. In Sec. [\ref=sect:ground_state] we examine various properties of the two-particle ground state. The properties considered include the ground state wavefunction, momentum distributions (Sec. [\ref=subsect:mom_dist_ground]) and von Neumann entropy (Sec. [\ref=subsect:entropy_ground]). Particular emphasis is given to how these properties may be influenced by varying the 'experimentally controllable' parameters of barrier height and interaction strength. In Sec. [\ref=sect:excited_states] we systematically examine these same properties for the lowest excited states of this system. Finally, in Sec. [\ref=sect:summary] we summarize our findings and make some concluding remarks.

System Hamiltonian

Consider a system of two interacting particles confined in two dimensions by means of a 'tight' harmonic potential, having trapping frequency [formula] and associated length scale [formula]. In the remaining third dimension, the confining potential is, relatively, 'loose' and has the form

[formula]

The parameters A and κ determine the precise form of the double-well potential. It is straightforward to verify that the two minima of this double-well potential are located at [formula], with the potential at these minima being [formula]. The well separation, [formula], and the barrier height, [formula], are controlled by the parameter κ.

As a result of the large energy level separation, associated with the transverse eigenstates ([formula]), the transverse motion of the particles is 'frozen out'. In this way the particles are confined to the lowest motional state in each of these transverse directions. In this case the system is quasi-1D and may be effectively described by

[formula]

Here, m is the mass, and x1 and x2 are the coordinates of atoms 1 and 2, respectively. The quantity g1D represents the particle-particle interaction strength, and is related to the 1D s-wave scattering length (a1D) through [formula]. In turn, a1D is related to the 3D s-wave scattering length, a3D, through [formula], where C is a constant and has approximate value C  =  1.4603 [\cite=ols98].

In the limit of tight confinement the free-space pseudopotential approximation, for the particle-particle interactions, becomes compromised [\cite=blo02] [\cite=tie00]. In this case, one may obtain the eigenenergies for the system by employing an energy-dependent scattering length and solving for the energy eigenvalues self-consistently [\cite=bol02] [\cite=bol03] [\cite=bur02]. For current purposes it is supposed that we are in the regime for which the pseudopotential approximation is still valid and the 1D collisional coupling, g1D, acts as a parameter for the system.

The aim is to study the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the 2D Hamiltonian given in Eq. ([\ref=eq:two_part_ham_unscaled]). To facilitate this we introduce the scaling xi  =  α for i  =  1,2. Under this rescaling the time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) can be written as

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here the scaling factor, α, has been chosen such that

[formula]

Consequently,

[formula]

For convenience we shall drop 'bar' on all quantities and use, exclusively, the scaled quantities just described.

Energy spectrum

The eigenspectra for the single- and two-particle system are obtained, subject to the scaling introduced in the previous section. A cartesian DVR [\cite=bay86] is used to discretize the spatial coordinates x1 and x2, see [\cite=murA07] for details. The discretization scheme used in these calculations employs N  =  61 mesh points in each dimension with a mesh spacing of h  =  0.16. Consideration is mainly limited to the four lowest eigenvalues of the two-particle system (i.e. the lowest band), in particular we are interested in the behavior as the parameters κ and g1D are varied.

Single-particle spectrum

Subject to the scaling introduced in Sec. [\ref=sect:system_hamiltonian] the TISE for the single-particle system is simply

[formula]

The single-particle spectrum is presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:sin_part_eig_spec]. One can see that as the parameter κ is increased the lowest eigenvalues are pulled downwards in energy as [formula] becomes increasingly negative. At the same time one observes the degeneracy of energy levels as κ is increased.

Two-particle spectrum

Extending consideration to the two-particle spectrum, we focus attention on the two-particle eigenstates belonging to the lowest band. Denoting the [formula] eigenstate of the two-particle system by Ψi, the eigenstates for the lowest band are then denoted by Ψ0,Ψ1,Ψ2 and Ψ3 (see Sec. [\ref=sect:excited_states] for details). This lowest band corresponds to the four lowest levels in Fig. [\ref=fig:two_part_eig_spec](a), representing the two-particle system in the absence of interactions. In this non-interacting regime the two-particle eigenstates, under exchange symmetry, are

[formula]

with the two-particle eigenenergies given by corresponding combinations of the single-particle energies, [formula]. From Fig. [\ref=fig:two_part_eig_spec](a), one notes that as κ is increased all two-particle eigenstates in the lowest band become degenerate. This degeneracy follows automatically from the degeneracy of the states [formula] and [formula] seen in the single-particle case (see Fig. [\ref=fig:sin_part_eig_spec]). The states, which are symmetric (solid lines) and antisymmetric (dashed lines) under exchange, are indicated, corresponding to boson and fermion pairs.

The effect of introducing interactions between the two bosons is displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig:two_part_eig_spec](b) - (d). In Fig. [\ref=fig:two_part_eig_spec](b) a scaled interaction coupling of g1D  =  1 is considered. The symmetric states are shifted upwards in energy as a result of the repulsive interactions while the antisymmetric states remain unaltered. In the limit of large κ one now observes two pairs of degenerate levels, as opposed to the set of four degenerate states seen in the non-interacting case. The energy separation of these two pairs of levels is monotonically increasing with increasing κ. Increasing the interaction coupling further, Fig. [\ref=fig:two_part_eig_spec](c), leads to one of the symmetric states being promoted above the higher-lying antisymmetric state for small κ, but with increased κ the normal ordering is restored. Finally, Fig. [\ref=fig:two_part_eig_spec](d) depicts the same spectrum in the limit of strong repulsion: g1D  =  10. The lowest symmetric state now follows closely the energy profile of the lowest antisymmetric state. This feature is a universal property for a system of strongly interacting bosonic particles in 1D. In the limit of g1D  →    ∞   the bosonic particles become impenetrable, and one enters the so-called Tonks-Girardeau regime [\cite=ton36] [\cite=gir60]. The Fermi-Bose mapping [\cite=gir60] [\cite=yuk05] allows, for example, the ground state of the bosonic system to be given by

[formula]

The similarity of the energy of the symmetric ground state and the lowest antisymmetric state, seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:two_part_eig_spec](d), is an indication that the system is approaching this Tonks-Girardeau regime.

Ground-state properties

The ground state wavefunction, [formula], for two interacting particles, is presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:psi00]. The individual color scale plots will be referenced using standard (row, column) matrix notation.

In the non-interacting case and for κ  =  0, plot (1,1), the wavefunction is distributed fairly isotropically about the centre of the trap. Moving down this column, increasing κ, the wavefunction expands slightly in both dimensions and takes on a more rectilinear appearance, e.g. plot (3,1). For small values of κ, the potential resembles that of a square well. The x4 term gives rise to a steep boundary and the distribution of the two (independent) particles will be quite uniform, leading to the distribution seen in (3,1). As the value of κ is increased the wavefunction begins to segregate into four quadrants with suppression in the region of the barrier (i.e. along the lines x1  =  0 and x2 = 0). This effect is seen, quite markedly, in plot (4,1). Considering the energy level spectrum in Fig. [\ref=fig:two_part_eig_spec](a) one can see that for κ  =  2 one has not yet reached the insulator limit, whereas for κ  =  5 one is deep within this insulator regime, for which degeneracy is observed for the four lowest two-particle levels.

Turning to the fourth column of Fig. [\ref=fig:psi00], plot (1,4) shows the case of no barrier (κ  =  0). The repulsive interaction precludes any overlap of the particles. The effect of increasing the barrier height to κ  =  1, κ  =  2 and κ  =  5 can be seen in plots (4,2), (4,3) and (4,4), respectively. Again, for small values of κ, the wavefunction distribution expands slightly in (x1,x2) space, but now the presence of repulsive interactions distorts the wavefunction along the line x1  =    -  x2. In the insulator limit, as we have for (4,4), one sees that the wavefunction has split into two clear lobes.

The behavior observed in Fig. [\ref=fig:psi00] correlates closely to the behavior reported for the δ-split potential in [\cite=murA07]: the segregation of the wavefunction distribution into four quadrants, and the vacancy of two of these quadrants owing to the introduction of repulsive interactions. These features are essentially generic for double-well systems.

Momentum distribution

The reduced single-particle density matrix (RSPDM) has proven to be an extremely useful mathematical construct in the analysis of pair correlations [\cite=col_re]. For the two-particle system considered here, the RSPDM, [formula], for a given eigenstate, [formula], is defined to be

[formula]

This object has been analyzed in detail for the ground state of two particles in a δ-split potential [\cite=murA07]. The behavior of [formula] for the double-well, presented here, exhibits the same gross features as have been observed in [\cite=murA07] for the δ-split trap problem. Instead, in this section we focus on the momentum distributions for this system.

The reciprocal momentum distribution for the ith eigenstate, [formula], is calculated from the corresponding reduced single-particle density, [formula], through Fourier transform

[formula]

where [formula]. Equivalently, one may obtain the momentum distribution for this eigenstate by considering the diagonalization of [formula]. Specifically, the eigenvalue equation is

[formula]

where λij, represents the fractional population of the 'natural orbital' [formula] such that [formula], for each i. Using numerical quadrature allows one to rewrite ([\ref=eq:rspdm_diag]) as a linear equation. The momentum distribution, [formula], may then be obtained from the relation

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the Fourier transform of the natural orbital [formula],

[formula]

The momentum distribution for the ground state is presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:mom_dist_00]. The distributions presented correspond to g1D  =  0 (a), g1D  =  1 (b), g1D  =  2 (c) and g1D  =  5 (d). Also within each figure, the distributions arising for several different values for the barrier height (κ) are illustrated. In the non-interacting case, Fig. [\ref=fig:mom_dist_00](a), one observes an initial peaked distribution for κ  =  0. Increasing κ enhances the peak and narrows the distribution. With increasing barrier, the ground-state wavefunction adapts to spread over the available interval, leading to this reciprocal narrowing in momentum space. Further increase in κ means that the particles begin to experience the effect of the double-well. As the particles are non-interacting, the system displays a single-particle behavior. For a value of κ  =  5 (insulator regime) the particle splits between the wells and the momentum distribution displays prominent second-order peaks, seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:mom_dist_00](a). The momentum distributions can be observed by scattering or free expansion of the particles in the absence of a confining potential. From this perspective the second-order peaks correspond to the interference fringes that arise from two coherent matter wave sources.

Introducing an interaction encourages localization and has the effect of removing these secondary peaks. Once again, for small values of κ, e.g. κ  =  1 (dashed line) and κ  =  2 (dot-dash line), the momentum distribution becomes increasingly peaked and narrower. In the presence of interactions the particles are restricted to separate wells and the interference effects are lost. In addition, the localization of the particles leads to a broadening of the momentum distribution, as observed in Fig. [\ref=fig:mom_dist_00](b), (c) and (d), for κ  =  5 (dotted line). It is also observed that, in the absence of any barrier, κ  =  0 (solid line), one sees the emergence of higher-energy wings for increasing interaction, g1D. Similar high-energy wings have been reported in the TG regime for free space, [\cite=ols98], and harmonic confinement, [\cite=gir01].

Von Neumann entropy

Entanglement is a fundamental expression of information content and is responsible for the increased efficiency of some quantum algorithms over their classical counterparts. Previous authors have shown that the von Neumann entropy of the RSPDM is a good measure of entanglement for a system of two bosons [\cite=pas01] [\cite=li01] [\cite=sun06]. For the case of two indistinguishable particles, determination of whether or not the two subsystems are entangled requires that one considers both the von Neumann entropy of the reduced single-particle density matrix, and the Schmidt number i.e. number of non-zero eigenvalues (λij) obtained in the diagonalization of ρi, Eq. [\eqref=eq:rspdm_diag], [\cite=ghi03] [\cite=ghiA04] [\cite=ghiB04]. We use the von Neumann entropy to quantify the entanglement in the position coordinates, x1 and x2, of the particle pair.

Following the diagonalization of the reduced single-particle density, Eq. ([\ref=eq:rspdm_diag]), the von Neumann entropy for the [formula] eigenstate of the two-particle system (Si) is obtained from,

[formula]

Variation of von Neumann entropy with interaction strength

Variation of the von Neumann entropy with g1D, for the ground state of this system, is plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:entropy_v_int_ground]. Examining the lowest solid line (κ  =  0), when no interactions are present (g1D  =  0) then S  =  0 as one expects. The product states (with correct symmetrization) given in Eq. ([\ref=eq:two_part_eigen_C00]) represent the eigenstates of the non-interacting system. Introducing a small interaction has the effect of introducing correlations and results in a non-zero entropy. Increasing the interaction strength leads to an increasing entropy, saturating at S  ≈  1, as for the harmonic potential [\cite=murA07] [\cite=sun06]. This behavior can be related to fermionization. As the repulsive interactions increase, the system enters the TG regime. In this regime the ground state of the system can be represented by the corresponding system of two non-interacting fermions, with correct symmetrization. In terms of the eigenfunctions prescribed in Eq. ([\ref=eq:two_part_eigen_C00]), the ground state of the system is given by [formula]. The antisymmetric state, Ψ1, in the presence of point-like interactions, will always give S  =  1. The ground state of the system becomes degenerate with this antisymmetric state in the limit of hard-core interactions.

Fig. [\ref=fig:entropy_v_int_ground] also displays the effect of increasing the barrier height, κ. As the system tends towards the insulator regime, the entropy of the system becomes increasingly sensitive to changes in g1D, about g1D  =  0. This effect was also reported in [\cite=murA07] for the δ-split trap, suggesting that this is another generic feature associated with double-well potentials. The increased barrier height reduces tunneling between the wells. For any increase in the interaction strength, the two-particle wavefunction will attempt to redistribute so as to minimize this interaction. However, with the increased barrier height the wavefunction is forced to remain more localized, and is restricted in its redistribution.

Variation of von Neumann entropy with barrier height

Variation of the von Neumann entropy with κ, for the ground state of this system, is plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:entropy_v_barrier_ground]. The basic trends bear a striking resemblance to those seen for the δ-split trap, [\cite=murA07]. Specifically, one observes that the initial entropy of the system (i.e. for κ  =  0) is dictated by the interaction strength of the system, g1D. The larger is g1D, the larger is the initial value of S, as is consistent with Fig. [\ref=fig:entropy_v_int_ground]. Increasing the height of the barrier then has the effect of increasing the entropy of the system towards S  =  1. In the limit of large barrier heights the entropy of the system saturates at S = 1, regardless of the value of interaction strength (the notable exception being the non-interacting case, for which S is identically equal to zero for all κ). This saturation at S  =  1 corresponds to the loss of entanglement.

When the system enters the insulator limit there is an implicit exchange uncertainty in the state of the system, arising from the indistinguishable nature of the particles. As such, these correlations cannot be exploited in any meaningful quantum information protocol and the system is regarded as non-entangled. This diagnosis also follows from the criteria set out in [\cite=ghi03] [\cite=ghiA04] [\cite=ghiB04] as, in the limit κ  →    ∞   then S  →  1 and the Schmidt number can be seen to approach a value of 2 (not shown here). By the criteria outlined in [\cite=ghiA04], any state for which S  =  1 and with a Schmidt number of 2 must be regarded as non-entangled.

In contrast to the δ-split trap, the entropy dependence [formula] for the double-well system is quite sigmoidal. The separation of wells only becomes apparent for large values of κ (i.e. κ  >  3). From Fig. [\ref=fig:entropy_v_barrier_ground] one can identify 2  <  κ  <  3 as the interval over which the entropy makes its most rapid variation.

Von Neumann entropy in the Bose-Hubbard model

One may examine the von Neumann entropy of the ground state within the formalism of the Bose-Hubbard model presented in Eq. [\eqref=eq:bose_hubbard_ham]. Using a Fock basis for the two-particle system of the form [formula], where nL(R) represents the number of particles in the left (right) well, leads to three basis states : [formula], [formula] and [formula].

Thus, in terms of this basis the Hamiltonian [\eqref=eq:bose_hubbard_ham] may be written in matrix form as

[formula]

with eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian follow from some simple algebra

[formula]

The eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues presented in Eq. [\eqref=eq:bose_hubbard_eig_val] are found to be

[formula]

where N± represent normalization factors and [formula] has odd inversion symmetry.

Given the two-particle ground state in the Fock basis, [formula] , one may determine the reduced single-particle density matrix by tracing over the degrees of freedom of either particle. The single-particle basis states may be represented in the form [formula] as [formula] and [formula]. In turn, the two-particle basis states can be written in the symmetric form:

[formula]

The eigenvalues of this RSPDM are found to be

[formula]

The variation of the ground-state entropy (S) with the model parameters J and U is depicted as a surface plot in Fig. [\ref=fig:bhm_entropy_surf_JU]. It is noted that the qualitative behavior of the entropy displayed in Figs. [\ref=fig:entropy_v_int_ground] and [\ref=fig:entropy_v_barrier_ground] for varying g1D and κ, respectively, is reflected in the Bose-Hubbard model with variation of the parameters U and J. This tight-binding approximation is poor in the limit U / J  →  0, but is an accurate representation in the insulator limit.

Excited states

Attention is now turned to the three lowest excited states which, together with the ground state, represent the lowest energy band of the two-particle double-well system. In the non-interacting case, with spectrum depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:two_part_eig_spec](a), the three lowest excited states may be represented as given in Eq. [\eqref=eq:two_part_eigen_C00], with one of these states being antisymmetric and two of them symmetric. Variation of parameters κ and g1D can lead to reordering of the energy eigenvalues, as observed in Fig. [\ref=fig:two_part_eig_spec]. However, in this section, the study of the excited states of this two-particle system will be restricted to these three states of the lowest band, identifiable through their symmetry. Henceforth the term 'first-excited state' refers to the lowest energy antisymmetric state (Ψ1), 'second-excited state' refers to the second-lowest energy symmetric state (Ψ2) and 'third-excited state' refers to the third-lowest lying symmetric state (Ψ3).

Two-particle excitations

The wavefunctions for Ψ1,2,3 are represented, by means of color scale plots, in Figs. [\ref=fig:psi01], [\ref=fig:psi02] and [\ref=fig:psi03], respectively. Again, the standard (row, column) notation is used to reference individual subplots. The color scale is consistent across all wavefunction plots, permitting direct comparison between Figs. [\ref=fig:psi00], [\ref=fig:psi01], [\ref=fig:psi02] and [\ref=fig:psi03].

Fig. [\ref=fig:psi01] represents the ground state for a system of two spin-aligned fermions (Ψ1), which is identically zero along the line x1  =  x2 and, thereby, unaffected by the zero-ranged interaction. Considering Fig. [\ref=fig:psi01], moving along a given row (i.e. increasing repulsion for a fixed barrier), the wavefunction plots remain unchanged, illustrating the independence of this state with respect to interaction strength, g1D. As κ increases (i.e. down any column) the positive and negative lobes along the x1  =   - x2 diagonal become more widely separated indicating isolation into separate wells. Once again the wavefunction density in these two quadrants correspond to the situation where particle 1 is in the left well (x1  <  0) and particle 2 is in the right (x2  >  0), and vice versa. In the limit of a large barrier, the ground state becomes degenerate with this antisymmetric state. The wavefunction plots are almost identical (except for sign) for κ  =  5 as seen, for example, by comparing Fig. [\ref=fig:psi00] (4,4) and Fig. [\ref=fig:psi01] (4,4). Furthermore, as already discussed, one expects the ground state to become degenerate with this antisymmetric state in the limit of g1D  →    ∞  , for all κ. This degeneracy is evidenced by comparing the fourth column in Fig. [\ref=fig:psi00] to any column in Fig. [\ref=fig:psi01]. Even at this finite interaction strength (g1D  =  5) the equivalence of these two states is apparent. Finally, from each of the plots in Fig. [\ref=fig:psi01] it is clear that this eigenstate is of odd parity, such that [formula].

Fig. [\ref=fig:psi02] depicts the second-excited state for the system of two bosons in a double-well potential and, as with Ψ1, this state exhibits odd parity: [formula]. The case of no barrier (κ  =  0) and no interaction (g1D  =  0) is illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:psi02] (1,1). The eigenstate is composed of two lobes which correspond to both particles co-existing on the same side of the well. In the case of no interactions (g1D  =  0), illustrated in column 1, this symmetric eigenstate is degenerate with the antisymmetric state considered in Fig. [\ref=fig:psi01]. Repulsive interactions will tend to exclude the wavefunction from the line x1  =  x2 (e.g. compare (1,1) to (1,3) or (1,4)). In the Tonks limit this splits each of the upper right and lower left lobes. Considering the effect of the barrier in column 3 (g1D  =  2), the initial wavefunction demonstrates the double-lobe structure. As the barrier is increased to κ  =  1, (2,3), and then κ  =  2, (3,3), the wavefunction spreads out in (x1,x2) space. Further increase of the barrier height causes the system to move into the insulator limit, plot (4,3), forming two isolated lobes in the upper-right and lower-left quadrants. The eigenstate, in this case, corresponds to the physical situation of both particles residing in either the left well or the right well.

Finally, the third-excited state is illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:psi03]. In contrast to Ψ1 and Ψ2, this eigenstate is of even parity such that [formula]. Scanning down column 1: as the system moves into the insulator limit, the eigenstate is composed of four equally-weighted lobes in the four quadrants, equivalent to the corresponding ground-state eigenfunction, seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:psi00] (4,1). In fact from Fig. [\ref=fig:two_part_eig_spec](a), in the non-interacting case, the four lowest eigenstates all become degenerate in the insulator limit (κ  →    ∞  ). As a consequence, the eigenfunction plot (4,1) in Figs. [\ref=fig:psi00], [\ref=fig:psi01], [\ref=fig:psi02] and [\ref=fig:psi03] relate to four degenerate states.

This symmetric eigenstate is non-zero along the line x1  =  x2. As one increases g1D one again observes the exclusion of the wavefunction from this line (e.g. examining row 1 in Fig. [\ref=fig:psi03]). As barrier height is increased the wavefunction expands in (x1,x2) space and there is some suppression of the wavefunction in the region of the rising barrier (i.e. x1  =  0 and x2  =  0). In the insulator limit, e.g. in plot (4,4) for which κ  =  5, the wavefunction in the off-diagonal quadrants vanishes and one observes two double-lobes in the lower-left and upper-right quadrants, representing the physical situation where both particles reside in the same well. The degeneracy of Ψ2 and Ψ3, in the limit κ  →    ∞   (seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:two_part_eig_spec]) is manifested in the corresponding wavefunction plots. This is demonstrated by comparing corresponding plots in the bottom rows (κ  =  5) of Figs. [\ref=fig:psi02] and [\ref=fig:psi03].

In the limit of large κ (and for any positive interaction), the ground and first-excited states correspond to the two particles in separate wells. By contrast, the second- and third-excited states, in the same limit, correspond to two particles in the same well. It follows that an increase in the repulsive interaction coupling will cause this second pair of levels to be shifted upwards in energy. In this way, in the κ  →    ∞   limit, one observes the separation of these two pairs of levels to increase as g1D is increased (see Fig. [\ref=fig:two_part_eig_spec]). The increasing separation of these levels with increasing κ is corollary to this. As κ is increased the particles become more tightly confined to the individual wells. This increased confinement, for the upper pair of levels, will give rise to an increased interaction of the two particles and a subsequent increase in the energy of these eigenstates, relative to the lower pair.

Momentum distribution

The momentum distributions for the excited states are calculated as outlined in Sec. [\ref=subsect:mom_dist_ground]. The calculated distributions for the second-excited state ([formula], where the superscript 'o' indicates the 'odd' inversion symmetry of this eigenstate) are displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig:mom_dist_02]. For κ  =  0 one observes a double-humped distribution that becomes narrower with increasing κ and, in the insulator limit, gives way to a single-peak distribution with high-energy tails. This is similar to the result for [formula] (not shown). An increase in the interaction coupling has the effect of narrowing the momentum distribution. Fig. [\ref=fig:psi02] illustrates that increasing g1D will expand the wavefunction in (x1,x2) space, leading to this reciprocal narrowing in momentum space. At the same time the increased interaction leads to an accentuation of the double-peaked structure, observed for small κ.

Fig. [\ref=fig:mom_dist_03] illustrates the momentum distribution for the even-parity state [formula]. For the non-interacting case, g1D  =  0 (a), a double-mode distribution arises with a node at k  =  0. This node is accounted for due to the separable nature of [formula] in the non-interacting limit: [formula]. Considerable narrowing of this distribution is noted as κ is increased and in the insulator limit a second pair of smaller peaks emerges. This second pair of peaks may be viewed as interference fringes from each particle being distributed between the two wells - compare Fig. [\ref=fig:psi00] (4,1) and Fig. [\ref=fig:psi03] (4,1).

For increased interaction strength (g1D) one continues to observe the narrowing of the distribution with increased barrier height. However, the presence of the interactions causes the node at k = 0 to be removed, as one can no longer write the eigenfunction in the separable form given in Eq. [\eqref=eq:two_part_eigen_C00]. Instead one just observes a strong depression of the distribution about k  =  0. At the same time, the introduction of the interactions has the effect of completely removing the double-peaked structure in the insulator limit, as is observed for the dotted line (κ  =  5) in each of Fig. [\ref=fig:mom_dist_03](b), (c) and (d). As seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:psi03], in the presence of a finite interaction the wavefunction in the off-diagonal quadrants vanishes in the insulator limit, and this eigenstate describes a situation where both particles occupy one side of the double-well.

Von Neumann entropy

As for the ground state, one may obtain the von Neumann entropy for the excited states of the two-particle system via diagonalization of the reduced single-particle density matrix. In this section the dependence of the von Neumann entropy, S, of the four lowest two-particle states, on the interaction strength (g1D) and the barrier height (κ) is considered.

Variation of von Neumann entropy with interaction strength

Fig. [\ref=fig:entropy_v_int_excited] illustrates the dependence of S on the interaction coupling, g1D (>  0). The dependence is examined for four different values of barrier height: κ  =  0 (a), κ  =  2 (b), κ  =  4 (c) and κ  =  5 (d). For each value of the barrier height the entropy of the four lowest eigenstates is depicted: ground state (solid line), first-excited state (dashed line), second-excited state (dot-dash line) and third-excited state (dotted line). The dependence of the ground-state entropy on g1D has already been examined in Fig. [\ref=fig:entropy_v_int_ground], however it is useful to replicate these plots here to help inform the examination of the excited-state plots.

Several important features are noted. In all cases the first-excited state (dashed line) shows no dependence on the interaction strength, as is expected owing to the symmetry of this eigenstate. Instead, this eigenstate exhibits a value of S  =  1 for all g1D. This value follows from the analytic form for this eigenstate, [formula], given by Eq. [\eqref=eq:two_part_eigen_C00], which holds for all values of g1D. At the same time, the analytic representations for the three remaining eigenstates are also given in Eq. [\eqref=eq:two_part_eigen_C00], for g1D  =  0. From these representations it is clear that, in the non-interacting limit, the entropy for the ground state (solid line) and third-excited state (dotted line) is always zero, as these states may always be represented as direct-product states for g1D  =  0. In a similar way, the second-excited state (dot-dash line) always assumes a value of S  =  1 in the non-interacting limit. Once again, this may be attributed to the symmetrized form for this state as given by [formula] in Eq. [\eqref=eq:two_part_eigen_C00].

Considering the case of κ  =  0, Fig. [\ref=fig:entropy_v_int_excited](a), the ground state begins at S  =  0 and increases monotonically with g1D. As g1D  →    ∞   one enters the TG regime and this ground state (solid line) becomes degenerate with the first-excited (dashed line) state and S  ≈  1. By contrast, the second-excited state begins with S  =  1, as discussed, and increases with increasing g1D, but at a much slower rate than that exhibited by the ground state. The third excited state (dotted line) begins, like the ground state, with S  =  0 and increases rapidly with increasing interaction strength.

Increasing the height of the barrier to κ  =  2, Fig. [\ref=fig:entropy_v_int_excited](b), one observes qualitatively similar behavior from all four states except that each state exhibits a more marked variation in S over the range of g1D examined. As one moves into the insulator regime, e.g. κ  =  4, Fig. [\ref=fig:entropy_v_int_excited](c), the behavior changes quite significantly. As discussed previously, the ground state exhibits a very drastic variation with g1D, converging very rapidly to S  ≈  1. The second-excited state still exhibits the same basic behavior as noted for smaller κ but, once again, the increased barrier height leads to an increased sensitivity of this state to variation in g1D. The third-excited state shows a distinct change in behavior for this increased barrier height. At small values of interaction coupling (g1D  <  1) the entropy of this state follows closely that of the ground state. As interaction strength is increased beyond this value then the ground-state entropy begins to plateau at S  ≈  1, whilst that of third-excited state continues to increase. Increasing the barrier height to κ  =  5, Fig. [\ref=fig:entropy_v_int_excited](d), moves the system deeper into the insulator limit and the behavior demonstrated in (c) becomes even more striking. In this case the behavior of the ground-state entropy is more dramatic, with the entropy saturating at S  ≈  1, already, for g1D  ≈  0.5. Again the entropy of the third-excited state follows this trend identically. However, where the entropy of the ground state plateaus at S  ≈  1, the entropy of the third-excited state continues to increase and follows now, almost identically, the entropy of the second-excited state. A handle on this behavior is provided by the wavefunction plots of Figs. [\ref=fig:psi00], [\ref=fig:psi02] and [\ref=fig:psi03]. One observes that, in this insulator limit (κ  =  5), the third-excited state, for small g1D, as seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:psi03] (4,1), closely resembles the ground state in Fig. [\ref=fig:psi00] (4,1). For larger interaction couplings (g1D  ≥  1) the eigenfunction for this third-excited state, as seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:psi03] (4,2) - (4,4), closely resembles that of the second-excited state in Fig. [\ref=fig:psi02] (4,2) - (4,4).

Variation of von Neumann entropy with barrier height

The variation of von Neumann entropy with barrier height is illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:entropy_v_barrier_excited], for the same four, lowest-energy two-particle states. In this case, four different values of interaction coupling are presented: g1D  =  1 (a), g1D  =  2 (b), g1D  =  5 (c) and g1D  =  10 (d). Again, in each plot the eigenstates are represented by the same line types used in Fig. [\ref=fig:entropy_v_int_excited].

Some general features and behaviors can be noted from these plots. Again, the first-excited state is observed to have an entropy of unity for all g1D and κ. For κ  →    ∞  , the entropy of the ground state tends to a value of unity, regardless of the value of g1D (provided g1D  >  0). In this limit the ground state of the system is described by one particle in each half of the double-well potential, and corresponds to the Mott-insulator regime. On the other hand, the initial value of S (when κ  =  0) is sensitive to g1D. The higher the value of g1D, the larger is the initial value of S. As S  →  1 in the insulator limit, it follows that the entropy of the ground state exhibits a less dramatic variation with κ, for larger values of interaction strength. For all of the symmetric eigenstates, i.e. ground (solid line), second-excited (dot-dash line) and third-excited (dotted line), as the interaction strength is increased the entropy of the eigenstates, in general, increases, consistent with Fig. [\ref=fig:entropy_v_int_excited]. In particular, the entropy of these symmetric states in the absence of a barrier (κ  =  0), increases with increasing g1D. The second-excited state (dot-dash line) exhibits an entropy that monotonically increases with κ for the range of parameter space considered. By contrast, the third-excited state (dotted line) exhibits an entropy that both increases then decreases with raising of the barrier.

One will also note that in the limit of large barrier heights (i.e. κ  →    ∞  ), the entropy of the second- and third-excited states tend to the same value. Although not obvious from Fig. [\ref=fig:entropy_v_barrier_excited](d), this fact has also been verified for the case of g1D  =  10. Once again, a handle on why this happens can be obtained from the wavefunction plots for these eigenstates in Figs. [\ref=fig:psi02] and [\ref=fig:psi03]. One can see that in the presence of finite interactions, these two eigenstates become identical in the insulator limit, except for some phase (compare row 4 of these figures). Fig. [\ref=fig:entropy_v_barrier_excited] also suggests the the value of S to which these two states converge, in the insulator limit, is greater than one and increases with increasing interaction strength, g1D.

This behavior of the entropy may be qualitatively understood as follows. Both the second- and third-excited states correspond, in the insulator limit, to the physical situation of two particles coexisting in either the right-well or the left-well. As such, these states may be roughly represented by Bell-type states of the form [formula] - see Sec. [\ref=subsubsect:bose_hubbard_entropy] for the definition of these basis states. Such a Bell state carries one e-bit of entanglement, with a corresponding von Neumann entropy of unity. However, beyond this, there are also correlations between the two particles coexisting in the same well. As can be seen, for example, from Fig. [\ref=fig:psi03] (4,4). Here the repulsive interactions between the particles occupying the same well leads to a partition of the wavefunction, within each well, into two lobes. Considering the double lobe seen in the upper-right quadrant, corresponding to both particles co-existing in the right well of the double-well. The upper half of the lobe represents the situation where particle 1 is on the left of this well and particle 2 is on the right, the lower half-lobe corresponds to the reverse of this situation (x1  ↔  x2). In this case the correlations in the system are analogous to the correlations that are observed for the ground state, Ψ0, in the absence of any barrier (κ  =  0). These correlations (and therefore S) are seen to increase as the interaction coupling is increased. One significant distinction exists between these 'single-well' correlations, seen in states Ψ2,3, and the correlations seen in the ground state, for κ  =  0. On increasing κ, the second- and third-excited states tend to become more confined and the two-particle wavefunction becomes increasingly localized in the single-well. However, the particle-particle interactions will compete with this effect, attempting to keep the two-particle wavefunction spread in space and, in particular, minimized along the line x1  =  x2. For the ground state this particular type of single-well competition between κ and g1D is not experienced. So, in the insulator limit, the second- and third-excited states will have correlations arising from the realization of the Bell-type state, and the 'single-well' correlations due to the two interacting particles coexisting in the same well. This combination of factors leads to an entropy which is greater than unity, with the contribution of the 'single-well' correlations, in general, increasing with increasing interaction strength.

Stimulating two-particle excitations

The previous results have clearly illustrated that manipulations of this two-particle system can be achieved through the variation of the control parameters g1D and κ in some adiabatic manner. However, one could also consider time-dependent manipulation of the state. Considering the insulator limit, one may propose two methods of coupling these lowest levels: (a) shaking the trap from side-to-side (b) modulating the barrier height (see Fig. [\ref=fig:bhm_manipulations]). To first-order, the former represents a dipole excitation, capable of coupling [formula] and [formula]. The latter scheme (to first-order) corresponds to a quadrupole excitation, capable of coupling states [formula] and [formula]. In this way, by employing such techniques it should prove possible to exploit these three lowest eigenstates in order to engineer the two-particle state in a time-dependent fashion.

Further investigation of this idea of time-dependent manipulation of the two-particle state could prove a useful extension to the present study. In particular, a combination of time-dependent excitation processes and the adiabatic variation of control parameters, g1D and κ, should permit an impressive degree of control over the two-particle state, within this system.

Summary

The system of two interacting particles in a prototypical double-well potential of the form [formula] has been considered. Using a cartesian DVR, the eigenspectrum for this system has been studied and the four lowest eigenstates have been obtained and investigated for varying barrier height and interaction strength. For each state the two-particle eigenfunction, the momentum distribution and the von Neumann entropy have been examined. It was found that the ground state for this double-well system exhibits behavior that closely resembles that observed in a previous study of the δ-split trap potential, [\cite=murA07]. In particular, the ground-state wavefunction is suppressed along the lines x1  =  0 and x2  =  0 as barrier height is increased, leading to a quadrant separation of the wavefunction. In the presence of repulsive interactions (g1D  >  0) only the contributions in the off-diagonal quadrants remain in the insulator limit (κ  →    ∞  ). In this limit the ground state of the system is composed of one particle in each half of the double-well. The momentum distributions display an initial narrowing with increasing barrier height but with a broadening and high-energy wings being observed in the insulator limit. Furthermore, the secondary peaks observed in the momentum distribution for the double well, in the non-interacting regime, are quickly suppressed in the presence of repulsive interactions. The variation in the von Neumann entropy (S) with interaction strength shows remarkably similar behavior. In all cases S  =  0 in the absence of interactions and for g1D  →    ∞  , S saturates at a value close to unity. Increasing the height of the barrier, in each case, has the effect of making the entropy more sensitive to changes in the interaction strength, around g1D  =  0. Similarly, the behavior of the entropy with varying barrier height exhibits generic features between the two double-well systems. In both cases the ground-state entropy saturates at a value of unity as κ  →    ∞  , regardless of the value of g1D. The initial value of S (i.e. the value of S for κ  =  0) is determined by the strength of the interaction, with larger interaction coupling leading to larger initial entropy. As such, the sensitivity of S to κ is reduced for double-well systems with larger interaction couplings (g1D). This behavior of the ground-state entropy is also illustrated within a Bose-Hubbard model, wherein the controllable parameters are the on-site interaction (U) and the tunnelling strength (J).

As well as examining the ground state of this double-well system, some of the properties of the three lowest excited states have also been studied. Two of these states are found to be symmetric whilst one is antisymmetric and they constitute the lowest band of the two-particle, double-well system. The antisymmetric state is found to be completely independent of the interaction parameter (g1D). However, this state displays a dependence on the barrier height and in the limit of a high barrier becomes degenerate with the ground state - corresponding, physically, to the situation of each particle residing in a separate, isolated well. The von Neumann entropy for this antisymmetric state is identically equal to one for all κ and g1D.

The second- and third-excited states are symmetric. In the insulator limit (provided g1D  >  0) the states become degenerate and correspond to the physical situation where both particles occupy the same well. Both eigenstates demonstrate momentum distributions that are double-humped, with the double-hump giving way to a single peak in the insulator limit. For g1D  =  0 the third-excited state exhibits secondary peaks in the momentum distribution, similar to the ground state in the non-interacting regime. The entropy of both states increases with g1D, with that of the third-excited state showing a more marked variation. As for the ground state, increasing barrier height κ has the effect of increasing the sensitivity of the entropy to variations in g1D (about g1D  =  0). In the insulator limit the entropy of the third excited state is found to follow, almost identically, that of the ground state for small g1D. As the ground state entropy saturates at S  ≈  1, the entropy of the third excited state continues to increase and, for larger g1D, follows, almost identically, that of the second-excited state. Indeed, in the insulator limit and for fixed interaction strength, the second- and third-excited states are found to have the same entropy (as follows from the physical equivalence of these states in this limit). The entropy, in this case, is proposed to have two contributions due to (i) the realization of a Bell-type state with both particles co-occupying either the left or right well (ii) single-well correlations, owing to the repulsive interaction of the two particles occupying the same well.

Outlook

The double-well arrangement studied in this work represents a more experimentally realizable system, compared to the δ-split trap previously considered. Having characterized the properties of the ground and lowest-excited eigenstates, the foundation is laid for future investigation into state manipulations using this system. Future avenues may include the time-dependent manipulation of states through shaking of the trap, an oscillating barrier height or introduction of a constant, or oscillating, field gradient. These time-dependent manipulations, along with the adiabatic variation of the control parameters g1D and κ, should allow for comprehensive state engineering within the lowest band of this two-particle system.
