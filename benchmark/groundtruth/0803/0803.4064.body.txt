On the Berg-Chen-Ismail theorem and the Nevanlinna-Pick problem

The Hamburger moment problem is a problem of finding conditions on a sequence {sj}, [formula] so that there exists a positive Borel measure σ with infinite support and

[formula]

With σ one can associate the infinite Hankel matrix and the sequence of its principal submatrices

[formula]

By the famous result of Hamburger [\eqref=hmp] has a solution if and only if Hn  ≥  0 for all n.

Denote by {λn,j}nj = 0 the eigenvalues of Hn [\eqref=hm]. Because of the interlacing property we have

[formula]

and so for each k λn,k are monotone decreasing, λk(H) =  lim n  →    ∞λn,k exist, and

[formula]

Let us call the problem [\eqref=hmp] if λ0(H) > 0, and singular otherwise. In 2002 C. Berg, Y. Chen and M. Ismail [\cite=bci] proved a beautiful result which states that [\eqref=hmp] is regular if and only if it has infinitely many solutions (indeterminate).

The Hamburger moment problem is one of the representatives of the so called classical interpolation problems [\cite=akh]. In this note we address to another one, specifically, the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem in the Schur class S of functions contractive and analytic in the unit disk [formula]. This is a problem of finding the solutions of

[formula]

where zk are distinct points in [formula], wk complex numbers, and f∈S. The well known criterion for [\eqref=np] to have at least one solution is given in terms of Pick matrices by

[formula]

for all [formula]. For the eigenvalues {λn,j}nj = 0 of the matrices Pn the above relations [\eqref=in], [\eqref=lin] hold, and, again, we distinguish between the regular and singular Nevanlinna-Pick problem, i.e., in this paper we say that the problem [\eqref=np] is regular if λ0(P) > 0, and it is singular if λ0(P) = 0.

With respect to a number of various questions there is a strong similarity between different classical interpolation problems, that is, if one can prove this or that statement with respect to one of the classical problem a quite parallel statement holds for another one. In this note we investigate the question: is it true that a Nevanlinna-Pick problem has infinitely many solutions (indeterminate) if and only if λ0(P) > 0? We give a negative answer to this question. More precisely, we construct data {zk,wk}∞k = 0 of an indeterminate Nevanlinna-Pick problem such that λ0(P) = 0.

First of all we note that the Blaschke condition on the interpolation nodes Z = {zk}

[formula]

guarantees that the interpolation problem

[formula]

has infinitely many solutions. Indeed, every function of the form

[formula]

where g(z)∈S, and B(z) is the Blaschke product

[formula]

solves [\eqref=np0]. Note that [\eqref=bla] is necessary and sufficient for the problem [\eqref=np0] to be indeterminate.

Thus, our goal is to construct a Blaschke set Z such that λ0(P) = 0 for the sequence of Nevanlinna-Pick matrices of the specific form Pn = Kn, where

[formula]

In fact, our main statement here characterizes completely the regularity of such Nevanlinna-Pick problems in the above sense.

Recall, see e.g. [\cite=Garnett], that a (finite) Borel measure ν on [formula] is called a Carleson measure, if

[formula]

for all f∈H2. Here dm is the normalized Lebesgue measure on the unit circle [formula]. Due to Carleson's theorem such measures are characterized completely by the following property: there exists C > 0 such that

[formula]

for all -  π  <  φ  <  π, 0 < ε < 1,

[formula]

Let Z satisfy [formula], B(z) be the corresponding Blaschke product. The Nevanlinna-Pick problem [formula] is regular if and only if the measure ν, defined by

[formula]

is a Carleson measure in [formula].

Let ν [\eqref=cm1] be the Carleson measure. For arbitrary [formula] put

[formula]

with

[formula]

We have h(zj) = cjB'(zj) for [formula], and h(zj) = 0 for j  ≥  n + 1, so

[formula]

Hence by [\eqref=cm]

[formula]

and so λ0(K)  ≥  C- 1 > 0, as claimed.

Conversely, assume that the Nevanlinna-Pick problem in question is regular. Put

[formula]

It is easy to see that {φk} is complete in KB, so the system of functions

[formula]

[formula], and g∈H2, is dense in H2. We prove [\eqref=cm] for such functions. As above,

[formula]

and

[formula]

and so

[formula]

The proof is complete.

If the Nevanlinna-Pick problem [\eqref=np0] is singular (as in the example below), then so is the general problem [\eqref=np]. Indeed, for [formula]

[formula]

and so λ0(P)  ≤  λ0(K).

Example. Put zk = 1 - k- p, p > 1. Evidently Z is a Blaschke set. On the other hand

[formula]

so

[formula]

Thus the measure ν [\eqref=cm1] is infinite and, moreover, it is not of Carleson type.

There is a simple way of manufacturing regular Nevanlinna-Pick problems [\eqref=np0]. Recall that Z = {zk} is the Carleson (uniformly separated) sequence if

[formula]

Assume that Z satisfies [\eqref=car]. By the theorem of H. Shapiro and A. Shilds [\cite=shs] the system of functions

[formula]

forms the Riesz basis in KB. So, for all [formula] there is c > 0 such that

[formula]

or

[formula]

as claimed.
