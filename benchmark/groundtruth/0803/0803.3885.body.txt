Integral geometry under [formula] and [formula]

Introduction

Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space. By K(V) we denote the space of compact convex subsets of V. This space has a natural topology, the Hausdorff topology. A (convex) valuation is a functional [formula] with the following additivity property: Examples of valuations are the Euler characteristic χ (which equals 1 for non-empty K) and any Lebesgue measure.

In this paper, we will only consider continuous and translation invariant valuations. We set [formula] for the vector space of all continuous and translation invariant valuations on V. Alesker [\cite=ale04a], [\cite=ale05a] introduced a product structure on [formula] (in fact on some dense subspace consisting of smooth valuations).

Let V be endowed with a scalar product. For a compact subgroup G of [formula], we let [formula] denote the subspace of G-invariant valuations. Alesker has shown that [formula] is finite-dimensional if and only if G acts transitively on the unit sphere [\cite=ale00], [\cite=ale06]. In this case, [formula] consists of smooth valuations and [formula] is a finite-dimensional algebra.

Borel [\cite=bor49], [\cite=bor50] and Montgomery-Samelson [\cite=mosa43] gave a complete classification of connected compact Lie groups acting transitively and effectively on the sphere (compare also [\cite=bes87], 7.13). There are six infinite series

[formula]

and three exceptional groups

[formula]

For each group G in this list, three fundamental problems of integral geometry are as follows.

Hadwiger-type theorem for G: determine the dimension of [formula] and give a geometrically meaningful basis of this space.

Compute the algebra structure of [formula].

Compute the whole array of kinematic formulas and additive kinematic formulas.

The classical case [formula] was studied by Blaschke, Chern, Santaló, Hadwiger and others. Hadwiger showed that [formula], with a basis given by the intrinsic volumes [formula]. The graded algebra [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] (where deg t = 1).

For a compact subgroup G of [formula], we set [formula] with the product of Haar and Lebesgue measure. The principal kinematic formula for [formula] is

[formula]

Here and in the following, ωn is the volume of the n-dimensional unit ball. Higher and additive kinematic formulas are also classical.

Problem (i) for [formula] was solved by Alesker [\cite=ale03b], problem (ii) by Fu [\cite=fu06]. In general, the product structure of [formula] determines all kinematic formulas [\cite=befu06], but it may be rather hard to write down explicit formulas. For [formula], this was recently achieved in [\cite=befu08], thus solving problem (iii).

Alesker [\cite=ale04] computed the dimension of [formula]. The algebra structure was computed in [\cite=be06]. The kinematic formulas were known before by work of Tasaki [\cite=tas03].

Problems (i)-(iii) for [formula] were recently solved in [\cite=be08] and we will use these results in an essential way in the present work.

For the other groups from list [\eqref=eq_series]-[\eqref=eq_exceptions], very few is known.

In this paper, we will solve problems (i)-(iii) for the exceptional Lie groups [formula] and [formula]. Our method uses the inclusions and the fact that the integral geometry of [formula] and [formula] is well-understood. In particular, we will need that [formula] and [formula] act 2-transitively on the unit sphere. This is not the case for [formula], which is the reason why other ideas have to be used in the study of the integral geometry under this group.

Results

We define the group [formula] following [\cite=br87]. Other references are [\cite=hit00], [\cite=joy00] and [\cite=fu_ha91]. A nice historical account can be found in [\cite=agri07].

Let V be a 7-dimensional real vector space. Given φ∈Λ3V*, we set

If b(x,x)  ≠  0 for all x  ≠  0, φ will be called positive.

Choosing a basis [formula] of V*, we obtain an example of a positive 3-form by setting

[formula]

Let φ∈Λ3V* be positive. Then [formula] is defined as

Since φ is positive, b(x,x) lies in the same connected component of [formula] for all x  ≠  0. We fix the orientation on V in such a way that b(x,x) > 0 for all x  ≠  0.

Given an orientation preserving isomorphism [formula], we obtain a scalar product on V by setting [formula]. This scalar product induces an isomorphism [formula], sending ω to [formula] for a positively oriented orthonormal basis [formula] of V. In general τ'  ≠  τ. However, there is a unique choice of τ such that τ' = τ. Indeed, rescaling τ by a positive factor t2 will rescale τ' by t- 7, hence there is a unique t with τ' = τ. We fix in the following the scalar product with this property.

Since b is [formula]-equivariant, [formula] preserves 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 and the orientation. In other words, [formula]. In particular, the intrinsic volumes [formula] are [formula]-invariant.

Let W  ⊂  V be a 3-dimensional subspace. Choose vectors w1,w2,w3∈W such that [formula]. We set φ(W): = φ(w1,w2,w3). Clearly, φ(W) is well-defined (i.e. independent of the choice of w1,w2,w3) up to a sign; hence φ(W)2 is well-defined. It may be checked that two spaces [formula] are in the same [formula]-orbit if and only if φ(W1)2  =  φ(W2)2, but we will not use this fact in the following.

For a face F of a convex polytope P  ⊂  V, we let WF be the linear space parallel to F. The normalized volume of the outer angle at F is denoted by γ(F).

(Hadwiger-type theorem for [formula]) There is a unique valuation [formula] such that for each polytope P  ⊂  V

[formula]

There is a unique valuation [formula] such that for each polytope P  ⊂  V

[formula]

The valuations [formula] form a basis of the vector space [formula]. In particular, and all [formula]-invariant valuations are even.

Let G be any of the groups from the list [\eqref=eq_series]-[\eqref=eq_exceptions]. Then [formula] consists only of even valuations.

If - 1∈G, then the result is clear. The only groups with - 1∉G are SO(n) and SU(n) for n odd and G2. The case G = SO(n) is the classical Hadwiger theorem, which shows in particular that SO(n)-invariant valuations are even. The geometric reason behind this is a lemma of Sah ([\cite=klro97], Prop. 8.3.1).

The case G = SU(n) was studied in [\cite=be08], again there are no odd invariant valuations. Finally, the case G = G2 is treated in Theorem [\ref=thm_hadwiger_g2].

We set

[formula]

(Algebra structure of [formula]) Let t and u be variables of degree 1 respectively 3. Then the map [formula] covers an isomorphism between graded algebras

By the methods of [\cite=befu06], one can translate this algebra structure into the whole array of kinematic formulas for [formula]. As an example, we write down in explicit form the principal kinematic formula for [formula].

(Principal kinematic formula for [formula]) For compact convex sets K,L  ⊂  V we have

[formula]

Now we turn our attention to [formula]. We can define it in a short way as the universal covering of [formula]. However, it will be convenient to have an explicit description similar to the one for [formula] given above.

Let V+ be a complex 4-dimensional hermitian vector space. Let Ω be the symplectic 2-form of V+ and β∈Λ4V*+ be the real part of the holomorphic volume form, i.e. β(v1,v2,v3,v4) = Re det (v1,v2,v3,v4). Set

[formula]

This group is a compact connected subgroup of [formula] which acts transitively on the unit sphere of V+. For v∈S(V+), the stabilizer of [formula] at v is [formula], where W: = TvS(V+) and

[formula]

For [formula] we set Φ(W): = Φ(w1,w2,w3,w4), where w1,w2,w3,w4∈W satisfy [formula]. Then Φ(W) is well-defined up to a sign. It is easy to show that [formula] acts transitively on [formula] and that [formula] belong to the same [formula]-orbit if and only if Φ(W1)2  =  Φ(W2)2.

(Hadwiger-type theorem for [formula]) There exists a unique valuation [formula] such that for each polytope P  ⊂  V+ we have

[formula]

The valuations [formula] form a basis of [formula], in particular

We set η': = 5η  -  μ4. It will turn out that η' is primitive in the sense that μ1  ·  η' = 0.

(Algebra structure of [formula]) Let V+ be, as before, a hermitian vector space of complex dimension 4. Let t and u be variables of degree 1 respectively 4. Then the map [formula] covers an isomorphism between graded algebras

Again, we can compute all kinematic formulas for [formula] using this theorem and the results of [\cite=befu06]. We only give the following example.

(Principal kinematic formula for [formula]) For compact convex sets K,L  ⊂  V+ we have

Tools

Let V be a vector space of dimension n. Let [formula] be the vector space of continuous, translation invariant valuations. A valuation [formula] has degree k if μ(tK) = tkμ(K) for all t  ≥  0. It is even (resp. odd) if μ( - K) = μ(K) (resp. μ( - K) =  - μ(K)). We write [formula] for the subspace of valuations of degree k and parity ±  .

(P. McMullen, [\cite=mcmu77]) There is a direct sum decomposition

Suppose that V is endowed with a Euclidean scalar product. Let G be a compact subgroup of [formula] acting transitively on the unit sphere. Alesker has shown that [formula]. He introduced on [formula] a structure of a commutative and associative algebra with unit χ satisfying Poincaré duality [\cite=ale04a] [\cite=ale05a].

The next theorem is a particular case of the more general hard Lefschetz theorem of [\cite=bebr07] (where G-invariance is replaced by smoothness in the sense of [\cite=ale05a]).

(Hard Lefschetz theorem, [\cite=bebr07]) Let [formula] be defined by Then [formula] is an isomorphism. In particular, the Betti numbers satisfy the inequalities

[formula]

and the equations

The theorem in the case of even valuations was proved before by Alesker [\cite=ale03b], using the following fundamental result.

(Klain, [\cite=kl95]) Let [formula] be simple, i.e. μ vanishes on lower-dimensional compact convex bodies. Then μ is a multiple of the Lebesgue measure on V, in particular μ is of degree n.

This theorem has the following important consequence. The restriction of [formula] to a subspace [formula] is a multiple of the Lebesgue measure on W. Putting [formula] for the proportionality factor, one gets a function [formula], called the Klain function of μ. The resulting map [formula] is injective.

If μ is smooth in the sense of [\cite=ale05a] (in particular if [formula] for one of the groups from [\eqref=eq_series]-[\eqref=eq_exceptions]), then there exists a unique valuation [formula] whose Klain function is given by [formula]. This valuation is called Akesker dual or Fourier transform of μ. The Fourier transform can be extended to odd valuations, but we will not need this here.

An analogue of Klain's injectivity result in the case of odd valuations was proved by Schneider.

(Schneider, [\cite=schn96]) Let [formula] be simple. Then there exists an odd continuous function f on the unit sphere S(V) such that where Sn - 1(K,  ·  ) is the n - 1-th surface area measure of K. In particular, μ is of degree n - 1.

Let V be a Euclidean vector space of dimension n. Let [formula] act transitively on the unit sphere. For a hyperplane W  ⊂  V, let [formula]. Consider the restriction map

[formula]

Then r+k is injective for k  ≠  n while r-k is injective for k  ≠  n - 1.

Since G acts transitively on [formula], a valuation μ∈ ker r±k is simple. The statement thus follows from Theorems [\ref=thm_klain] and [\ref=thm_schn].

If H acts transitively on the unit sphere of W, then the dimension of [formula] is finite and we get a bound for the dimension of [formula]. This is the case precisely when G acts 2-transitively on the unit sphere S(V) (this means that if v1,v2,v1',v2'∈S(V) with 〈v1,v2〉  =  〈v1',v2'〉, then there exists g∈G with gv1 = v1' and gv2 = v2'). For the groups G from the list [\eqref=eq_series]-[\eqref=eq_exceptions], only [formula], [formula] and [formula] have this property.

We will need some results from [\cite=befu08] and [\cite=be08]. Let V be a hermitian vector space of complex dimension n and [formula]. Set p: = ⌊k / 2⌋. The restriction of the symplectic form Ω of V to W can be written in the form Here [formula] is an orthonormal basis of the dual space W* and [formula] is called the multiple Kähler angle of W [\cite=tas03b]. We denote the q-th elementary symmetric function by σq.

([\cite=befu08]) For 0  ≤  q  ≤  p, there exists a unique valuation [formula] such that for a polytope P  ⊂  V

These valuations are called Tasaki valuations. Note that τk,0  =  μk, the k-th intrinsic volume.

Under the subgroup [formula], there are some more invariant valuations; they are even and appear in the middle degree n. More precisely,

[formula]

Let us describe the "new" invariant valuations more explicitly.

For [formula], we set [formula], where [formula] is a basis of W with [formula]. If Ω|W is non-degenerated (which happens if and only if n = 2p is even and [formula]), we ask in addition that [formula] be a positively oriented basis.

If Ω|W is non-degenerated, then [formula] is a well-defined invariant. Otherwise, [formula] is well-defined. It is easily checked (compare [\cite=be08]) that in both cases

[formula]

([\cite=be08]) There exists a unique valuation [formula] such that If n = 2p is even, there exists a unique valuation [formula] such that

Note that these valuations are complex-valued. They were denoted by φ1,φ2 in [\cite=be08].

Construction of invariant valuations

In this section, we let V+ be a complex 4-dimensional hermitian vector space with the 4-form Φ as in [\eqref=eq_def_Phi] and V  ⊂  V+ a hyperplane with the positive 3-form φ from [\eqref=eq_def_phi]. We will write [formula] instead of [formula].

By Corollary [\ref=cor_dimension_bounds] with [formula] and [formula], we get the following dimensions:

[formula]

In particular, there are no non-zero odd [formula]-invariant valuations, which is non-trivial since [formula].

Clearly, there are no odd [formula]-invariant valuations, since [formula]. We apply Corollary [\ref=cor_dimension_bounds] with [formula] and [formula] and find the following dimensions:

[formula]

Let us show that in fact [formula], which also implies that [formula].

Recall that [formula] is a subgroup of [formula]. Besides the intrinsic volume μ4, there is another [formula]-invariant valuation of degree 4 which remains invariant under the bigger group [formula].

[formula] is [formula]-invariant and satisfies [\eqref=eq_def_eta].

Let [formula]. Fix a basis [formula] of W with [formula]. If Ω|W is non-degenerated, we ask in addition that [formula] be positive.

Let us write θi: = θi(W),i = 1,2; σq: = σq( cos θ1, cos θ2),q = 0,1,2 and Θ: = Θ(W). Then, by [\eqref=eq_def_Phi] and [\eqref=eq_norm_Theta],

[formula]

Using Theorems [\ref=thm_tasaki_valuations] and [\ref=thm_sun_valuations] we get for each polytope P  ⊂  V+ which is [\eqref=eq_def_eta]. This equation shows in particular that η is [formula] invariant.

Theorem [\ref=thm_hadwiger_spin7] follows from the proposition.

Let V be a hyperplane in V+. The stabilizer of [formula] at V is [formula], where φ: =  * WΦ|W (note that φ is only well-defined up to a sign depending on the choice of orientation on V).

We set [formula]. From [\eqref=eq_def_phi] we deduce that Equation [\eqref=eq_def_tau4] follows immediately.

We define ν3 by

Unfortunately, the verification of [\eqref=eq_def_tau3] seems to be less simple. If a continuous translation invariant valuation satisfies [\eqref=eq_def_tau3], then clearly its Klain function is given by W  ↦  φ(W)2, which is also the Klain function of ν3  =  4. Without giving the details, we indicate that [\eqref=eq_def_tau3] follows by noting that ν3 is a constant coefficient valuation in the sense of [\cite=befu08]. In fact, if N1(K)∈I7(V  ×  V) denotes the disk bundle of K, then we can represent ν3 by Here p1,p2:V  ×  V  →  V are the natural projections. Note that [formula] has constant coefficients.

Algebra structure and kinematic formulas

Since [formula], we get a canonical injection of graded algebras The image of η in [formula] is [formula]. The valuations φ4,2 and φ4,1 are in the annihilator of μ1. Using the results of [\cite=befu08] and [\cite=be08], one computes that

[formula]

Setting η': = 5η  -  μ4 one gets η'  ·  μ1 = 0 and [formula].

Next, we study the algebra structure of [formula]. Fix a hyperplane V0  ⊂  V. Let [formula] be of norm 1. Then ixφ is a symplectic form on V0 and there exists a unique almost complex structure J on V0 with 〈v,w〉 = ixφ(Jv,w).

The stabilizer of [formula] at V0 is given by [formula].

Let [formula] be the natural restriction map. Then

[formula]

For [formula], set θ: = θ1(W) and Θ: = Θ(W). Then φ(W) = ReΘ(W) and therefore

For [formula], we have [formula], where 0 = θ1  ≤  θ2 are the Kähler angles of W.

The statement of the lemma now follows from the definitions in Theorem [\ref=thm_tasaki_valuations] and Theorem [\ref=thm_sun_valuations].

The Alesker product is compatible with the restriction [formula], hence

Similarly,

[formula]

Since r+5 and r+6 are injective, we deduce that [formula] and [formula] in [formula]. From these two equations, the theorem follows.

Let us write ν4 in terms of the basis μ4,μ1  ·  ν3 of [formula]. As above, we get that [formula] and therefore Corollary [\ref=cor_kin_g2] now follows from the methods in [\cite=befu06].

We rescale the derivation operator Λ̃ of Theorem [\ref=thm_hlt] as in [\cite=befu08] by setting, on [formula], and rescale multiplication by μ1 by

The operators L,Λ define, together with the degree counting operator Hμ = (2 deg μ - 7)μ a representation of the Lie algebra [formula] on [formula].

The commutator relations = 2L and =  - 2Λ are immediate. We have to show that μ = Hμ for each [formula]. If μ is one of the intrinsic volumes, then this follows from a direct computation. It remains to show that this equation also holds for μ  =  ν3 and μ  =  ν4. The Fourier transform intertwines L and Λ (compare [\cite=befu06]) and therefore Similarly, It is now easy to compute that ν3 =  - ν3 and ν4  =  ν4.

Let us conclude with some general remarks. The algebra structure of the spaces [formula] is now known for the groups [formula] from the list [\eqref=eq_series]-[\eqref=eq_exceptions] . By looking at these algebras, some natural questions arise.

For G as above, rescaled versions of the derivation operator and of multiplication by μ1 define an [formula]-representation on [formula]. We conjecture that this will also be the case for the remaining groups from the list [\eqref=eq_series]-[\eqref=eq_exceptions]. On the bigger space [formula] of smooth translation invariant valuations, this is not true.

By Corollary [\ref=cor_only_even], [formula] for each of these groups G. However, our proof relies on a non-geometric case by case argument. Is there a direct explanation of this fact?

For each such group G, [formula] consists of constant coefficient valuations in the sense of [\cite=befu08]. Is this also true for the remaining groups from the list [\eqref=eq_series]-[\eqref=eq_exceptions]?
