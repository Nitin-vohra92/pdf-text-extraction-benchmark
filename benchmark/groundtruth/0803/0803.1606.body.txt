Symmetric Numerical Semigroups Generated by Fibonacci and Lucas Triples

Introduction

Recently the numerical semigroups [formula], i,k  ≥  3, generated by three Fibonacci numbers Fj were discussed in [\cite=mrr07]. It turns out that the remarkable properties of Fj in these triples suffice to calculate the Frobenius number [formula] and genus [formula] of semigroup. In this article we show that a nature of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers is sufficient not only to calculate the specific parameters of semigroups, but also to describe completely the structure of symmetric numerical semigroups [formula], 3  ≤  a < b < c, and [formula], 2  ≤  k < m < n, generated by Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, respectively. Based on divisibility properties of these numbers we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for both semigroups to be symmetric and calculate their Hilbert generating series, Frobenius numbers and genera.

Basic properties of the 3D symmetric numerical semigroups

Recall basic definitions and known facts about 3D numerical semigroups mostly focusing on their symmetric type. Let [formula] be the additive numerical semigroup with zero finitely generated by a minimal set of positive integers {d1,d2,d3} such that 3  ≤  d1 < d2 < d3, gcd (d1,d2,d3) = 1. Semigroup [formula] is said to be generated by the minimal set of three natural numbers if there are no nonnegative integers bi,j for which the following dependence holds:

[formula]

For short we denote the vector (d1,d2,d3) by [formula]. Following Johnson [\cite=john60] define the minimal relation R3 for given [formula] as follows

[formula]

where

[formula]

The uniquely defined values of vij,i  ≠  j which give aii will be denoted by aij,i  ≠  j. Note that due to minimality of the set (d1,d2,d3) the elements aij,i,j  ≤  3 satisfy

[formula]

The smallest integer [formula] such that all integers [formula], belong to [formula] is called the conductor of [formula],

[formula]

The number [formula] is referred to as the Frobenius number. Denote by [formula] the complement of [formula] in [formula], i.e. [formula]. The cardinality (#  ) of the set [formula] is called the number of gaps, [formula], or genus of [formula].

The semigroup ring [formula] over a field [formula] of characteristic 0 associated with [formula] is a polynomial subring graded by deg Xi = di, i = 1,2,3 and generated by all monomials zdi. The Hilbert series [formula] of a graded subring [formula] is defined [\cite=stan96] by

[formula]

where [formula] is a polynomial in z.

The semigroup [formula] is called symmetric iff for any integer s holds

[formula]

Otherwise [formula] is called non-symmetric. The integers [formula] and [formula] are related [\cite=heku71] as,

[formula]

Notice that [formula] is always symmetric semigroup [\cite=aper46]. The number of independent entries aij in ([\ref=herznon2]) can be reduced if [formula] is symmetric: at least one off-diagonal element of 3 vanishes, e.g. a13 = 0 and therefore a11d1 = a12d2. Due to minimality of the last relation we have by ([\ref=herznon2]) the following equalities and consequently the matrix representation as well [\cite=herz70] (see also [\cite=fel04], Section 6.2)

[formula]

where subscript "s" stands for symmetric semigroup. Combining ([\ref=herz5]) with formula for the Frobenius number of symmetric semigroup [\cite=herz70], [formula], we get finally,

[formula]

If [formula] is symmetric semigroup then [formula] is a complete intersection [\cite=herz70] and the numerator [formula] in the Hilbert series ([\ref=hilb0]) reads [\cite=stan96]

[formula]

Structure of generating triples of symmetric numerical semigroups

Two following statements, Theorem [\ref=the1] and Corollary [\ref=cor1], give necessary and sufficient conditions for [formula] to be symmetric.

If a semigroup [formula] is symmetric then its minimal generating set has the following presentation with two relatively not prime elements:

[formula]

It turns out that ([\ref=wat2]) gives also sufficient conditions for [formula] to be symmetric. This follows by Corollary [\ref=cor1] of the old Lemma of Watanabe [\cite=wata73] for semigroup [formula]

Let [formula] be a numerical semigroup, a and b be positive integers such that: (i) [formula] and c  ≠  di, (ii) gcd (c,λ) = 1. Then semigroup [formula] is symmetric iff [formula] is symmetric.

Combining Lemma [\ref=lem1] with the fact that every semigroup [formula] is symmetric we arrive at Corollary.

Let [formula] be a numerical semigroup, c and λ be positive integers, gcd (c,λ) = 1. If [formula], then the semigroup [formula] is symmetric.

In Corollary [\ref=cor1] the requirement c  ≠  d1,d2 can be omitted since both semigroups [formula] and [formula] are generated by two elements (d1,λd2) and are also symmetric.

Finish this Section with important proposition adapted to the 3D numerical semigroups.

The numerical semigroup [formula], gcd (3,d2,d3) = 1, [formula] and [formula], is never symmetric.

Divisibility of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers

We recall a remarkable divisibility properties of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers which are necessary for further consideration. Theorem [\ref=the3] dates back to E. Lucas [\cite=luc78] (Section 11, p. 206),

Let Fm and Fn, m > n, be the Fibonacci numbers. Then

[formula]

As for Theorem [\ref=the4], its weak version was given by Carmichael [\cite=car13] . We present here its modern form proved by Ribenboim [\cite=rib89] and McDaniel [\cite=wmd91].

Let Lm and Ln be the Lucas numbers, and let [formula], [formula], where [formula] and [formula] are odd positive integers and a,b  ≥  0. Then

[formula]

We also recall another basic divisibility property of Lucas numbers,

[formula]

We'll need a technical Corollary which follows by consequence of Theorem [\ref=the4].

Let Lm and Ln be the Lucas numbers, and let [formula], [formula], where [formula] and [formula] are odd positive integers and a,b  ≥  0. Then

[formula]

Symmetric numerical semigroups generated by Fibonacci triple

In this Section we consider symmetric numerical semigroups generated by three Fibonacci numbers Fc, Fb and Fa, c > b > a  ≥  3. The two first values a = 3,4 are of special interest because of Fibonacci numbers F3 = 2 and F4  =  3. First, the semigroup [formula], gcd (2,Fb,Fc) = 1, is always symmetric and has actually 2 generators. Next, according to Theorem [\ref=the2] the semigroup [formula] is symmetric iff at least one of two requirements, [formula] and [formula], is broken. Avoiding those trivial cases we state

Let Fc, Fb and Fa be the Fibonacci numbers where c > b > a  ≥  5. Then a numerical semigroup [formula] is symmetric iff

[formula]

Proof       By Theorem [\ref=the1] and Corollary [\ref=cor1] a numerical semigroup [formula] is symmetric iff

[formula]

By consequence of Theorem [\ref=the3] and definition of Fibonacci numbers we get

[formula]

The last containment in ([\ref=wat5]) gives

[formula]

that finishes the proof of Theorem.[formula]

Theorem [\ref=the5] remains true for any permutation of indices in triple (Fa,Fb,Fc). By ([\ref=herz6]), ([\ref=sylves10]) and ([\ref=wat4]) we get

Let Fc, Fb and Fa be the Fibonacci numbers and numerical semigroup [formula] be symmetric. Then its Hilbert series and Frobenius number are given by

[formula]

The next Corollary [\ref=cor4] gives only the sufficient condition for [formula] to be symmetric and is less strong than Theorem [\ref=the5]. However, instead of containment ([\ref=wat4]) it sets an inequality which is easy to check out.

Let Fc, Fb and Fa be the Fibonacci numbers where c > b > a  ≥  5. Then a numerical semigroup [formula] is symmetric if

[formula]

The Hilbert series and Frobenius number are given by ([\ref=wat8]).

Proof       The two first relations in ([\ref=wat9]) are taken from Theorem [\ref=the5] and were proven in ([\ref=wat6]). We have to use also the containment ([\ref=wat4]). For this purpose take Fc exceeding the Frobenius number of semigroup generated by two numbers Fa / Fλ and Fb / Fλ. This number [formula] is classically known due to Sylvester [\cite=sy884]. So, we get

[formula]

where the Hilbert series [formula] and Frobenius number [formula] are given by ([\ref=wat8]). Thus, Corollary is proven.[formula]

We finish this Section by Example [\ref=ex1] where the Fibonacci triple does satisfy the containment in ([\ref=wat4]) but does not satisfy inequality in ([\ref=wat9]).

{d1,d2,d3}  =  {F6 = 8,F8 = 21,F9 = 34}

Symmetric numerical semigroups generated by Lucas triple

In this Section we consider symmetric numerical semigroups generated by three Lucas numbers Ln, Lm and Lk, n > m > k  ≥  2. Note that the case k = 2 is trivial because of Lucas number L2 = 3 and Theorem [\ref=the2]. The semigroup [formula] is symmetric iff at least one of two requirements, [formula] and [formula], is broken.

Let Lk, Lm and Ln,   n,m,k  ≥  3, be the Lucas numbers and let

[formula]

Then a numerical semigroup generated by these numbers is symmetric iff Lk, Lm and Ln satisfy

[formula]

and one of three following relations:

[formula]

Proof       By Theorem [\ref=the1] and Corollary [\ref=cor1] a numerical semigroup [formula] is symmetric iff there exist two relatively not prime elements of its minimal generating set such that

[formula]

Represent n and m as in ([\ref=lis1a]) and substitute them into the 1st relation in ([\ref=lis3]). By consequence of Theorem [\ref=the4] it holds iff

[formula]

First, assume that the 1st requirement in ([\ref=lis3a]) holds that results by Theorem [\ref=the4] in η = Ll. Making use of notations ([\ref=lis1a]) for k move on to the 2nd requirement in ([\ref=lis3]) and apply Corollary ([\ref=cor2]). Here we have to consider two cases a = b  ≠  0 and a = b = 0 separately.

[formula]

Now, assume that the 2nd requirement in ([\ref=lis3a]) holds that results by Theorem [\ref=the4] in η = 2. Making use of the 2nd requirement in ([\ref=lis3]) and applying ([\ref=wat3c]) we get,

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=lis3b]), ([\ref=lis3c]) and ([\ref=lis3d]) we arrive at ([\ref=lis2a]). The last requirement in ([\ref=lis3]) together with Theorem [\ref=the4] gives

[formula]

that proves ([\ref=lis2]) and finishes proof of Theorem.[formula]

By consequence of Theorem [\ref=the6] the following Corollary holds for the most simple Lucas triples.

Let [formula], [formula] and [formula] be the Lucas numbers with odd indices such that

[formula]

Then a numerical semigroup generated by these numbers is symmetric iff

[formula]

Proof follows if we apply Theorem [\ref=the6] in the case a = b = c = 0, see ([\ref=lis3c]).

We give without derivation the Hilbert series and Frobenius number for symmetric semigroup [formula].

[formula]

In general, the containment ([\ref=lis5b]) is hardly to verify because it presumes algorithmic procedure. Instead, one can formulate a simple inequality which provide only the sufficient condition for semigroup [formula] to be symmetric.

Let [formula], [formula] and [formula] be the Lucas numbers with odd indices such that ([\ref=lis5a]) is satisfied and the following inequality holds,

[formula]

Then a numerical semigroup [formula] is symmetric and its Hilbert series and Frobenius number are given by ([\ref=lis6]).

Its proof is completely similar to the proof of Corollary [\ref=cor4] for symmetric semigroup generated by three Fibonacci numbers.

We finish this Section by Example [\ref=ex2] where the Lucas triple does satisfy the containment in ([\ref=lis5b]) but does not satisfy inequality ([\ref=lis7]).
