Introduction

A table algebra is a C-algebra with nonnegative structure constants was introduced by [\cite=Ar2]. As a folklore example, the adjacency algebra of an association scheme (or homogeneous coherent configuration) is an integral table algebra. On the other hand, the adjacency algebra of an association scheme has a special character which is called the standard character, see [\cite=HIG]. We generalize the concept of standard character from adjacency algebras to C-algebras. This generalization enables us to find a necessary and sufficient condition for which a commutative table algebra comes from an association scheme.

In section [\ref=2309072] we recall the concept of C-algebras and some related properties which we will use in this paper.

In section [\ref=2309073] we first define the standard feasible trace for C-algebras which is a generalization of the standard character in the theory of association schemes. Thereafter, we show that the standard feasible multiplicities of the characters of a table algebra and its quotient are the same. Furthermore, we prove that the set of standard feasible multiplicities preserve under C-algebras isomorphism.

In section [\ref=stchar] we give an example of C-algebra for which the standard feasible trace is a character, such character is called the standard character. By using the standard character we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for which a commutative table algebra comes from an association scheme.

Preliminaries

Although in algebraic combinatorics the concept of C-algebra is used for commutative algebras, in this paper we will also consider non-commutative algebras. Hence we deal with non-commutative C-algebras in the sense of [\cite=EPV] as the following:

Let A be a finite dimensional associative algebra over the complex field [formula] with the identity element 1A and a base B in the linear space sense. Then the pair (A,B) is called a non-commutative C-algebra if the following conditions (I)-(IV) hold:

1A∈B and the structure constants of B are real numbers, i.e., for a,b∈B:

[formula]

There is a semilinear involutory anti-automorphism (denoted by *) of A such that B*  =  B.

For a,b∈B the equality λab1A  =  δab*|a| holds where |a| > 0 and δ is the Kronecker symbol.

The mapping b  →  |b|,b∈B is a one dimensional *  -linear representation of the algebra A, which is called the degree map.

In the definition above we should mention that if the algebra A is commutative, then (A,B) becomes a C-algebra in the sense of [\cite=Ban].

If the structure constants of a given C-algebra (resp. commutative) are nonnegative real numbers, then it is called a table algebra (resp. commutative) in the sense of [\cite=Ar2] (resp. [\cite=Ar1]).

Throughout this paper a C-algebra ( resp. table algebra) will mean a non-commutative C-algebra (resp. non-commutative table algebra).

A C-algebra (table algebra) is called integral if all its structure constants λabc are integers. The value |b| is called the degree of the basis element b. From condition (IV) we see that |b|  =  |b*| for all b∈B, and from condition (II) for [formula] we have [formula], where [formula] means the complex conjugate to xb. This implies that the Jacobson radical J(A) of the algebra A is equal to {0} which means A is semisimple.

Let (A,B) and (A',B') be two C-algebras. A C-algebra homomorphism from (A,B) to (A',B') is an *  -algebra homomorphism f:A  →  A' such that f(B) = B'. Such C-algebra homomorphism is called C-algebra epimorphism (resp. monomorphism) if f is onto (resp. into). A C-algebra epimorphism f is called a C-algebra isomorphism if f is monomorphism too. Two C-algebras (A,B) and (A',B') are called isomorphic, if there exists a C-algebra isomorphism between them.

Given a table algebra (A,B), the bilinear form 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 on A is defined in [\cite=Ar2] by setting 〈x,y〉 = t(xy*), for x,y∈A, where [formula] is a linear function defined by [formula]. Then one can see that 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 is a Hermitian positively definite form on A.

A nonempty subset C  ⊆  B is called a closed subset, if C*C  ⊆  C. We denote by C(B) the set of all closed subsets of B.

Let (A,B) be a table algebra with the basis B and let C∈C(B). From [\cite=Ar], it follows that {CbC| b∈B} is a partition of B. A subset CbC is called a C-double coset or double coset with respect to the closed subset C. Let

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. Then the following theorem is an immediate consequence of [\cite=Ar]:

Let (A,B) be a table algebra and let C∈C(B). Suppose that [formula] be a complete set of representatives of C-double cosets. Then the vector space spanned by the elements bi  /  C,1  ≤  i  ≤  k, is a table algebra ( which is denoted by A / C) with a distinguished basis B  /  C  =  {bi  /  C| 1  ≤  i  ≤  k}. The structure constants of this algebra are given by the following formula:

[formula]

where t∈CbkC is an arbitrary element. 1.2ex width 1ex depth -.1ex

The table algebra (A / C,B / C) is called the quotient table algebra of (A,B) modulo C.

We refer the reader to [\cite=Zi] for the background of association schemes.

The standard feasible trace for C-algebras

In this section we first define the standard feasible trace for C-algebras and then we show that the standard feasible multiplicities of the characters of a table algebra and its quotient are the same. Furthermore, we prove that the set of standard feasible multiplicities preserve under C-algebras isomorphism.

Let (A,B) be a C-algebra and let [formula] be the set of irreducible characters of A. We define a linear function ζ∈ by ζ(b) = δ1Ab|B+|, for b∈B, where [formula]. It is easily seen that ζ(bc) = ζ(cb), for all b,c∈B. This shows that ζ is a feasible trace in the sense of [\cite=Hi]. In addition, since radζ  =  {0}, where [formula], it is a non-degenerate feasible trace on A. Therefore, from [\cite=Hi] it follows that [formula] where [formula] and all ζχ are non-zero. We call ζ the standard feasible trace, ζχ the standard feasible multiplicity of χ and [formula], the set of standard feasible multiplicities of the C-algebra (A,B).

Since A is a semisimple algebra

[formula]

where εχ's are the central primitive idempotents.

Let [formula]. Then

[formula]

For every φ,ψ∈

[formula]

In commutative case, for every b,c∈B

[formula]

Part (i) and (iii) follow from [\cite=Hi] and [\cite=Hi], respectively, by using the concept of dual basis relative to a non-degenerate feasible trace, indeed the dual basis of b relative to standard feasible trace ζ is [formula] for b∈B. Part (ii) follows from equality εφεψ  =  δφψεφ by replacing b* by 1A. 1.2ex width 1ex depth -.1ex

From ([\ref=23100701]) one can see that in commutative case, ζχ is the coefficient of 1A in the linear combination of |B+|εχ in terms of the basis elements of B.

Let (A,B) be a table algebra and C∈C(B). Set e = |C+|- 1C+. Then e is an idempotent for the table algebra A and the subalgebra eAe denoted by H, is equal to the quotient table algebra (A / C,B / C) modulo C, see [\cite=Ar]. Let ζ be the standard feasible trace of the table algebra (A,B). Then ζ|H is the standard feasible trace for (A / C,B / C). Indeed, assume that T  ⊆  B be a complete set of representatives of C-double cosets of A. Then [formula] and [formula]. Since

[formula]

it follows that ζ|H is the standard feasible trace for (A / C,B / C). Thus we proved the following lemma:

Let (A,B) be a table algebra with the standard feasible trace ζ and let C∈C(B). Then ζ|H is the standard feasible trace of (A / C,B / C). 1.2ex width 1ex depth -.1ex

In the following we will show that the standard feasible multiplicities of the characters of a table algebra and its quotient are the same. For this, we need to observe a relationship between the characters of a table algebra and its quotient. The next three theorems and corollaries are proved for adjacency algebra of an association scheme, see [\cite=HAN]. Now we generalize them for table algebras.

Let (A,B) be a table algebra and let [formula] be the set of central primitive idempotents of (A,B). Then [formula] is the set of central primitive idempotents of the quotient table algebra (A / C,B / C) where C∈C(B) and e = |C+|- 1C+.

Suppose that εχ∈P such that eεχ  ≠  0. Then the algebra εχA is isomorphic to A(V) where V = εχA. Let T be the image of the idempotent eεχ with respect to this isomorphism. From [\cite=Na], it follows that the algebra eεχH is isomorphic to A(TV). Since the latter algebra is simple, so eεχ is a central primitive idempotent of the algebra H. On the other hand, since e is the unit element of H and [formula] where eεχ runs over the set [formula], we conclude that PC is the set of all central primitive idempotents of the quotient table algebra (A / C,B / C) and we are done. 1.2ex width 1ex depth -.1ex

There is a one to one correspondence between [formula] and (H) by the map [formula].

This is an immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=240108]. 1.2ex width 1ex depth -.1ex

Let (A,B) be a table algebra and C∈C(B). Then every irreducible A-module V is an irreducible H-module iff [formula], where e = |C+|- 1C+.

Let V be an irreducible A-module and let D be a matrix representation of A defined by V. Since e is an idempotent, rank D(e) = χ(e), where χ is the irreducible character afforded by D. On the other hand, rank [formula]. Hence

[formula]

We first suppose that V is an irreducible H-module. Then [formula], and so χ(e)  ≠  0. Thus equality ([\ref=correspond3]) implies that [formula].

Conversely, let [formula]. From equality ([\ref=correspond3]) and Corollary [\ref=corresond] we deduce that [formula] is an irreducible character of H. Thus V is an irreducible H-module and we are done. 1.2ex width 1ex depth -.1ex

The theorem below gives the relationship between the standard feasible multiplicity of a character of a table algebra (A,B) and the quotient table algebra (A / C,B / C).

The standard feasible multiplicity of χ|H is equal to that of χ if χ|H  ≠  0.

Let {εχ ~ | ~ χ∈(A)} be the set of central primitive idempotents of A. Then ζ(eεχ) = ζχχ(eεχ). On the other hand, from Theorem [\ref=240108] we conclude that ζ(eεχ) = ζ|H(eεχ). But from Lemma [\ref=280208] it follows that ζ|H(eεχ) = ζχ|Hχ|H(eεχ), where ζχ|H is the standard feasible multiplicity of χ|H. This implies that ζχχ(eεχ) = ζχ|Hχ|H(eεχ). Thus ζχ  =  ζχ|H, as claimed. 1.2ex width 1ex depth -.1ex

Suppose that (A,B) is a C-algebra and ρ∈ such that ρ(b) = |b|. Then ρ is an irreducible character of A, which is called the principle character of (A,B). From ([\ref=23100702]) by replacing φ and ψ by ρ we conclude that ζρ = 1. Moreover, if (A,B) is a commutative C-algebra, then [\cite=Ban] shows that ζχ  >  0. In the following lemma we give a lower bound for the standard feasible multiplicities of the characters of a table algebra.

Let (A,B) be a table algebra. Then |ζχ|  ≥  χ(1A)- 1, for every [formula]. In particular, if (A,B) is commutative table algebra then |ζχ|  ≥  1.

We first claim that |χ(a)|  ≤  |a|χ(1), where a∈B and χ is a character of A. To do this, let D be a representation of A which affords character χ and let a∈A. Suppose that ma(x) is the minimal polynomial of a and Spec(a) is the set of all roots of ma(x). Let [formula]. Then a - λ.1A can not be invertible, see [\cite=DF]. So there exists a non zero element x∈A such that (a - λ.1A)x = 0 or equivalently ax = λx. But by [\cite=Ar2] we have |〈ax,x〉|  ≤  |a|〈x,x〉 and so the latter equality implies that |λ〈x,x〉|  ≤  |a|〈x,x〉. Therefore |λ|  ≤  |a|. This fact along with the obvious inclusion Spec[formula] prove the claim. Now the result follows by applying the degree map |  ·  | on the both sides of the equation ([\ref=23100702]).

The second statement is an immediate consequence of the first one, since χ(1A)  =  1 for commutative case. 1.2ex width 1ex depth -.1ex

The set of standard feasible multiplicities of two isomorphic C-algebras are the same.

Let (A,B) and (A',B') be two C-algebras and f:(A,B)  →  (A',B') be an isomorphism. Let ζ and ζ' be the standard feasible traces of (A,B) and (A',B'), respectively. Let [formula] be the set of central primitive idempotents of A. Then it is easily seen that the set [formula] is the set of central primitive idempotents of A', where χf(a')  =  χ(f- 1(a')) and a'∈A'. It follows that for any [formula] there exists [formula] such that (εψ)f  =  εχf, and so ψ(1)  =  χ(1). Therefore, by comparing the coefficient of 1A' in the both sides of the former equality we get

[formula]

where ζψ and ζ'χf are the standard feasible multiplicities of ψ and χf with respect to standard feasible traces ζ and ζ', respectively. This implies that ζψ  =  ζ'χf. Therefore the set of standard feasible multiplicities of the C-algebras (A,B) and (A',B') are the same, as desired. 1.2ex width 1ex depth -.1ex

The standard character

Let X be a set with n elements. According to [\cite=WI] a linear subspace W of the algebra [formula], the set of all n  ×  n matrices with entries in [formula], is called a cellular algebra on X if In,Jn∈W; W is closed under the matrix and the Hadamard (componentwise) multiplications and W is closed under transpose, where In is the identity matrix and Jn is the matrix all of whose entries are ones. For example, any complex adjacency algebra of an association scheme is a cellular algebra. Conversely, in the sense of [\cite=HIG] for a given cellular algebra W on a finite set X, there is a coherent configuration on X whose adjacency algebra is W. So cellular algebras and adjacency algebras are equivalent objects, see [\cite=WI]. On the other hand, any cellular algebra is a table algebra but the converse is not true, see Example [\ref=06100701]. In this section we are interested in finding a necessary and sufficient condition for which a commutative table algebra becomes a cellular algebra.

Let (X,G) be an association scheme and let [formula] be the complex adjacency algebra of G. Then the representation of [formula] which sends σg to itself for every g∈G affords a character γG which is called standard character of [formula], see [\cite=Zi]. Moreover, γG(σ1X)  =  |X| and γG(σg)  =  0 for 1X  ≠  g∈G and

[formula]

In this case by setting [formula] and B  =  {σg:g∈G}, the pair (A,B) is a C-algebra with the standard feasible trace ζ  =  γG given in ([\ref=081107st]). Therefore, the standard feasible multiplicities ζχ  =  mχ for [formula] are nonnegative integers.

In general, we do not know if ζχ's are nonnegative integers, or equivalently wether or not ζ is a character. It is interesting to find some examples of C-algebras apart from association schemes, for which ζ is a character. In example below we give a commutative table algebra which does not come from association schemes and for it ζ is a character. In the case that the standard feasible trace ζ of a C-algebra (A,B) is a character, by pattern of the theory of association schemes we call ζ the standard character of (A,B).

We say that a C-algebra has standard character condition, if it possesses the standard character. We denote by S the class of all such C-algebras.

Clearly association schemes belong to the class S and Example [\ref=06100701] below shows that the class S is larger than the class of association schemes. But this class is not equal to the class of integral table algebras, in fact in Example [\ref=examnonstand] below we give an integral table algebra does not belong to S.

For a given strongly regular graph (X,E) with parameters (n,k,λ,μ) one can find an association scheme C = (X,G) where G  =  {1X,g,h} with structure constants λgg1X  =  k,λggg  =  λ,λggh  =  μ. In [\cite=Bro] some of the necessary conditions for the existence of a strongly regular graph with parameters (n,k,λ,μ) are given. One of them is integrality condition. If we consider adjacency algebra of association scheme C, which is a C-algebra (A,B) of dimension 3, then one can see that the standard character condition for (A,B) is equivalent to integrality condition for the existence strongly regular graphs with parameters (n,k,λ,μ), see [\cite=Bro].

In Example [\ref=06100701] we will use the definition of a finite affine plane in the sense of [\cite=BJL]. We recall that for every finite affine plane P  =  (P,L,I), i.e., [formula] is finite, there exists an integers q  ≥  2, called the order of affine plane such that |P| = q2 and |L| = q2 + q, and each line is incident to exactly q  +  1 points. Besides, there are exactly q + 1 classes [formula] of pairwise parallel (nonintersecting) lines, each of which is of cardinality q.

(cfg. [\cite=PR]) Let P be a finite affine plane with point set P and line set L. Let [formula] be the algebra of all |P|  ×  |P| complex matrices whose rows and columns are indexed by the elements of P. Define a (0,1)-matrix [formula] by

[formula]

where l(u,v) is the line incident with both u and v. Then for all [formula] we have

[formula]

where r0 is the identity matrix. So the set [formula] is a linear base of the subalgebra A of the algebra [formula] generated by B. Then it is easily seen that (A,B) is a table algebra (with *   being the Hermitian conjugation in [formula]). An easy computation shows that the character table of the table algebra (A,B) is as follows:

[formula]

From Table (1) one can see that the standard feasible multiplicities of the characters of the table algebra (A,B) are positive integers. Thus ζ is a character. Now we claim that by a suitable integer q the table algebra (A,B) is not the complex adjacency algebra of any association scheme. To do so, suppose on the contrary that the table algebra (A,B) is the complex adjacency algebra of an association scheme (X,G), where [formula]. Then for each i,1  ≤  i  ≤  q + 1, the subset {g0,gi} of G is a closed subset and so [formula] is an equivalence relation on X. Now let L be the set of all equivalence classes of the equivalence relations Ei,1  ≤  i  ≤  q + 1. Then it is easily seen that the sets X and L form an affine plane of order q consisting X as the set of points and L as the set of lines. But we can choose a suitable integer q in such a way that there is no affine plane of degree q (see [\cite=BJL]), we get a contradiction. Thus (A,B) can not come from an association scheme.

Let (A,B)∈S be a commutative C-algebra. Then any matrix representation D of A which affords ζ is faithful.

Let D be a matrix representation of A which affords ζ. Suppose that [formula] is in the kernel of D, so D(a)  =  0. Since A is commutative, there is a non-singular matrix P such that for all bi∈B the following equality holds:

[formula]

where [formula]. It follows that [formula]. Therefore, MX  =  0, where M is an n  ×  n matrix whose (i,j) entry is ζχiχi(bj) and X is a column matrix whose i-th entry is xi. Now since M is a non-singular matrix, it follows that X  =  0 which implies that a  =  0. This completes the proof of the lemma. 1.2ex width 1ex depth -.1ex

Let (A,B)∈S be a table algebra and let D be a matrix representation of A which affords the standard character ζ. Then one can check that (D(A),D(B)) is a table algebra by defining D(b)* = D(b*) and |D(b)| = |b|.

We say that a table algebra (A,B) has an adjacency algebra homomorphic image, if there are an association scheme (X,G) and a C-algebra epimorphism [formula], where C  =  {σg:g∈G} is the basis of the adjacency algebra [formula].

Let (A,B) be a table algebra. Then (A,B) has an adjacency algebra homomorphic image iff (A,B)∈S and a matrix representation D which affords ζ satisfies the following conditions for any b∈B:

D(b*) = D(b)t.

D(b) is a (0,1)-matrix.

We first prove the necessity of conditions (1) and (2). Let [formula] be an adjacency algebra which is a homomorphic image of (A,B). So there exists a C-algebra homomorphism T from A onto [formula]. Then [formula] and T(b*) = T(b)t. It follows that |b| = |T(b)|, for b∈B. So T induces a matrix representation D of degree |B+| and conditions (1) and (2) are valid for D. Then the character χ which is afforded by D has values |B+| at 1A and 0 at any [formula]. This implies that χ is the standard character ζ of (A,B) and so (A,B)∈S, as desired.

Conversely, suppose that (A,B)∈S and conditions (1) and (2) hold for a matrix representation D of A which affords the standard character ζ. Since

[formula]

we conclude that the matrix D(b) contains |b| ones in each rows and columns. On the other hand, let b∈B such that D(b)ij = 1. If D(c)ij = 1 for some c∈B, then the (i,i) entry of matrix D(b)D(c)t = 1. It follows that b = c. Thus the matrices D(b),b∈B are disjoint and the sum of them is the matrix Jn where n = |B+|. This implies that (D(A),D(B)) is a cellular algebra ( or an adjacency algebra), as desired. 1.2ex width 1ex depth -.1ex

Let (A,B) be a commutative table algebra. Then (A,B) comes from an association scheme iff (A,B)∈S and a matrix representation D which affords ζ satisfies the following conditions for any b∈B:

D(b*) = D(b)t.

D(b) is a (0,1)-matrix.

This is an immediate consequence from Theorem [\ref=cel] and Lemma [\ref=embed]. 1.2ex width 1ex depth -.1ex

Let (A,B) be a C-algebra. The coordinate-wise multiplication [formula] with respect to the basis B by [formula], for b,c∈B is defined in the sense of [\cite=EPV]. We say that a matrix representation D of A preserves Hadamard products if [formula], for b,c∈B.

For a matrix A, τ(A) denotes the sum of all entries A. One can see that for any two square matrices A and B of the same size:

[formula]

Let (A,B)∈S be a table algebra and let D be a matrix representation of A which affords ζ. Then table algebra the (D(A),D(B)) is a cellular algebra iff D perseveres Hadamard products.

The necessity is obvious. For the sufficiency, since D(b),b∈B persevere Hadamard products, each D(b),b∈B is (0,1)- matrix. On the other hand,

[formula]

But tr(D(b*)D(c)) = 0 iff b  ≠  c. Thus D(b*) = D(b)t. Now the result follows from Theorem [\ref=cel] and we are done. 1.2ex width 1ex depth -.1ex

In the rest of this section, we suppose that (A,B) is a commutative C-algebra of dimension d with the set of the primitive idempotents [formula]. Then from [\cite=Ban] there are two matrices P  =  (pb(χ)) and Q = (qχ(b)) in [formula], where b∈B and [formula] such that PQ  =  QP  =  |B+|I and

[formula]

Then from Remark ([\ref=251007r]) and ([\ref=25100701]) we get

[formula]

where b∈B and [formula]. The dual of (A,B) in the sense of [\cite=Ban] is as follows: with each linear representation Δχ:b  ↦  pb(χ), we associate the linear mapping Δ*χ:b  ↦  qχ(b). Since Q = (qχ(b)) is non-singular, the set [formula] is a linearly independent and so form a base of the set of all linear mapping Â of A into [formula]. From [\cite=Ban] the pair (Â,B̂) is a C-algebra with the identity 1Â  =  Δ*ρ and involutory automorphism which maps Δ*χ to [formula], where [formula] is complex conjugate to χ. The C-algebra (Â,B̂) is called the dual C-algebra of (A,B). Moreover, the structure constants of (Â,B̂) which are given in [\cite=Ban] can be written as the following

[formula]

which are real numbers, where [formula] is the complex conjugate to pb(χ). From ([\ref=25100702]) and ([\ref=23100702]) one can see that [formula]. Then [formula]. The primitive idempotents fb,b∈B of Â are given by [\cite=Ban] as the following

[formula]

Keeping the notation above, there is a bijection correspondence between the standard feasible multiplicities of the characters of (Â,B̂) and the degrees of basis elements B. 1.2ex width 1ex depth -.1ex

From ([\ref=idmdual]), one can see that the coefficient of the unit element 1Â of Â in the linear decomposition of |B̂+|fb in terms of the basis elements B̂ is equal to pb(ρ). On the other hand, from the equation of the right hand side of ([\ref=25100703]) we get pb(ρ) = ρ(b)  =  |b|. But from Remark [\ref=251007r] any standard feasible multiplicity of the characters of (Â,B̂) corresponds to the number pb(ρ) for some b∈B, as desired. 1.2ex width 1ex depth -.1ex

A C-algebra is called integral degree if its all degrees |b|,b∈B, are integer.

Let (A,B) be a C-algebra. Then (A,B) is integral degree and belongs to S iff so is (Â,B̂).

Let (A,B) be a C-algebra and (Â,B̂) be its dual with the standard feasible traces ζ and [formula], respectively. To prove the necessity, since (A,B) is in S the equality [formula] implies that (Â,B̂) is integral degree. Since (A,B) is integral degree, from Lemma [\ref=181107] we conclude that (Â,B̂) is in S.

To prove the sufficiency, by the necessity we see that (,)∈S is integral degree. Now the proof follows from Lemma [\ref=251107] and the Duality Theorem [\cite=Ban], i.e., (A,B)≃(,). 1.2ex width 1ex depth -.1ex
