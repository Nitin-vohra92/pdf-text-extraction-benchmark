On the vanishing of negative homotopy K-theory

Introduction

The aim of this note is to prove the following theorem. For a scheme X and [formula] we consider homotopy K-theory KHi(X) as defined in [\cite=KBook].

Let X be a noetherian scheme of finite Krull dimension d. Then KHi(X) = 0 for i <  - d.

Weibel conjectured the analogue of this theorem with the K-Theory of Bass-Thomason-Trobaugh in place of homotopy K-theory, originally formulated as a question in [\cite=Weibel]. In fact Theorem [\ref=mainthm] is a special case of Weibel's original conjecture, as can be seen using the spectral sequence [\eqref=spseq].

Let X be a noetherian scheme of finite Krull dimension d and let p be a prime nilpotent on X. Then [formula] for i <  - d.

Note that under the conditions of Corollary [\ref=cor1] we have

[formula]

according to a result of Weibel, see [\cite=TT], where K denotes the Bass-Thomason-Trobaugh K-theory.

Corollary [\ref=cor1] has been shown in [\cite=Kelly] for X quasi-excellent using the alteration theorem of Gabber-de Jong. Our proof is more elementary as instead of weak resolution of singularities we use platification par éclatement [\cite=RG].

Some reductions

Let X be a noetherian scheme of finite Krull dimension d. If KHi(OX,x) = 0 for all x∈X and i <  -  dim (OX,x) then KHi(X) = 0 for i <  - d.

In the proof of Proposition [\ref=proploc] we need the following classical result of Grothendieck.

Let r  ≥  0 be an integer. Let F be a Zariski sheaf on the noetherian scheme X. Assume that Fx = 0 for all points x∈X with [formula]. Then Hi(X,F) = 0 for i > r.

Let [formula], where U runs through all open subsets of X, and let I be the set of finite subsets of J. For α∈I let Fα be the abelian subsheaf of F locally generated by the sections in α. Then

[formula]

as a filtered colimit. Since each local section of F is supported on a closed subscheme of dimension at most r there are closed immersions iα:Xα  →  X and abelian sheaves Gα on Xα such that dim Xα  ≤  r and such that [formula]. Then

[formula]

for i > r. Here [formula] is due to [\cite=Hart] and [formula] is due to [\cite=Hart].

Consider the convergent Zariski-descent spectral sequence, analogous to [\cite=TT],

[formula]

where i,X is the Zariski sheaf on X associated with KHi. For i <  - d and for - p - q = i let F be - q,X and let r be d - q. Then under the conditions of Proposition [\ref=proploc] we get Fx = KH- q(OX,x) = 0 for all x∈X with [formula] since

[formula]

So by Lemma [\ref=lem.vani] we deduce Ep,q2 = Hp(X,F) = 0 for all - p - q = i <  - d and therefore also KHi(X) = 0.

The following proposition is immediate in case the scheme X has a desingularization. However, we avoid any assumption on the existence of resolution of singularities by using Raynaud-Gruson's platification par éclatement instead.

Let X be a reduced scheme which is quasi-projective over a noetherian ring. Let f:Y  →  X a smooth and quasi-projective morphism. Let k > 0 be an integer and let ξ∈K- k(Y). There exists a birational projective morphism p:X'  →  X such that p̃*(ξ) = 0∈K- k(Y') where p̃:Y'  →  Y is the pull-back of p along f.

By Bass's definition of negative K-theory [\cite=KBook] the group K- k(Y) for k > 0 is a quotient of [formula], where [formula]. Elements of this K0-group coming from [formula] vanish in K- k(Y).

Without loss of generality ξ is represented by a vector bundle V on [formula]. We can extend V to a coherent sheaf [formula] on [formula], see [\cite=EGA]. Choose an open dense subscheme U  ⊆  X such that [formula] is flat over U. This is possible as X is reduced [\cite=EGA]. By platification par éclatement [\cite=RG] there is a projective birational morphism p:X'  →  X which is an isomorphism over U and such that the strict transform ' = pst() as a coherent sheaf on [formula] is flat over X', here Y' = X'  ×  XY.

Recall that the strict transform pst() is defined as the image of p̂*()  →  j*j*p̂*(), where [formula] is the canonical open immersion and where p̂ denotes the induced morphism [formula].

Note that [formula] is isomorphic to the usual pull-back of the sheaf V, as the latter is flat over X.

' has finite Tor-dimension as an [formula]-sheaf.

Lemma [\ref=tordim] implies by [\cite=KBook] that ' induces an element of [formula] whose restriction to [formula] represents p̃*(ξ)∈K- k(Y') via the Bass construction explained above. As any such element in negative K-theory vanishes we have proved Proposition [\ref=prop].

For a noetherian scheme Z we denote by D(Z) the derived category of OZ-modules whose cohomology sheaves are quasi-coherent and by Db(Z) the triangulated subcategory of bounded complexes with coherent cohomology sheaves. Let [formula] be a point with image x∈X'. Let [formula] be the natural map, [formula] the inclusion of the fiber Fx of [formula] over x and let ixy:y  →  Fx be the canonical morphism. By [\cite=WeibelHomological] we have to show that Li*y(')∈D(y) lies in Db(y). As ' is flat over X' we have Li*x(') = i*x(')∈Db(Fx). As Fx is a regular scheme, L(ixy)* maps Db(Fx) to Db(x) [\cite=WeibelHomological], so [formula] lies in Db(y).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm]

In the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm] we can, using Proposition [\ref=proploc], restrict to schemes X which are quasi-projective over noetherian rings. For such X we argue inductively on the dimension d =  dim (X). We may assume that X is reduced as KHi(X) = KHi(Xred), use [\cite=WeibelKH] and Zariski-descent. The case d = 0 of Theorem [\ref=mainthm] is shown in [\cite=WeibelKH].

Let d > 0 and assume Theorem [\ref=mainthm] for all schemes of Krull dimension less than d which are quasi-projective over a noetherian ring. Let [formula] be the usual cosimplicial scheme defined in degree p by [formula]. There is a right half-plane spectral sequence

[formula]

functorial in X, see [\cite=Thomason]. This is the Bousfield-Kan spectral sequence arising from the simplicial spectrum [formula] whose homotopy colimit is KH(X) by definition. For each p + q there is a filtration

[formula]

with [formula].

Let i <  - d. In order to conclude that KHi(X) = 0, we show inductively on p  ≥  0 that the group Fp(X) in the filtration [\eqref=filtration] vanishes for all X as above with dim (X)  ≤  d at once. Fix a scheme X of Krull dimension d which is quasi-projective over a noetherian ring and let γ∈Fp(X) be an element. We have [formula] by the induction hypothesis on p. As E∞p,q(X) is a subquotient of E1p,q(X), the element γ lifts to a class ξ∈Kq(X  ×  Δp). Note that q <  - d < 0.

By Proposition [\ref=prop] applied to the morphism Y = X  ×  Δp  →  X, we find a projective birational morphism p:X'  →  X such that p̃*(ξ) = 0∈Kq(Y'), here Y' = X'  ×  XY. We choose a nowhere dense closed subscheme [formula] such that p is an isomorphism outside Z and obtain a cdh-distinguished square

[formula]

As homotopy K-Theory satisfies cdh-descent by [\cite=Cisinski], we get a long exact sequence

[formula]

The groups KHi + 1(Z') and KHi(Z) vanish by the induction hypothesis on d as [formula], so KHi(X)  →  KHi(X') is injective (recall that i <  - d). Hence, it suffices to show that p*:KHi(X)  →  KHi(X') maps the element γ to zero. Since [formula], we have [formula] by the induction hypothesis. The morphism p*:KHi(X)  →  KHi(X') restricts to a morphism Fp(X)  →  Fp(X') which is compatible with p̃*:Kq(Y)  →  Kq(Y'). Since p̃*(ξ) = 0∈Kq(Y'), we conclude that p*(γ) = 0, so γ = 0. Hence we obtain Fp(X) = 0.
