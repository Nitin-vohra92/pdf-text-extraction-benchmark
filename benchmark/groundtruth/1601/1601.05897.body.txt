CROSS-TOPOLOGY AND LEBESGUE TRIPLES

Introduction

Let X, Y and Z be topological spaces. For a mapping f:X  ×  Y  →  Z and a point (x,y)∈X  ×  Y we write fx(y) = fy(x) = f(x,y). A mapping f:X  ×  Y  →  Z is said to be separately continuous, if mappings fx:Y  →  Z and fy:X  →  Z are continuous for all x∈X and y∈Y. If f:X  →  Y is a pointwise limit of a sequence of separately continuous mappings fn:X  →  Y, then f is a Baire-one mapping or f belongs to the first Baire class.

In 1898 H. Lebesgue [\cite=Leb1] proved that if [formula] then every separately continuous function f:X  ×  Y  →  Z belongs to the first Baire class. A collection of topological spaces (X,Y,Z) with this property we call a Lebesgue triple.

The result of Lebesgue was generalized by many mathematicians (see [\cite=Hahn] [\cite=Ru] [\cite=KMas3] [\cite=BanakhT] [\cite=K1] and the references given there). In particular, A. Kalancha and V. Maslyuchenko [\cite=KMas3] showed that [formula] is a Lebesgue triple if Z is a topological vector space. T. Banakh [\cite=BanakhT] proved that [formula] is a Lebesgue triple in the case when Z is an equiconnected space. It follows from [\cite=K1] that for every metrizable arcwise connected and locally arcwise connected space Z a collection [formula] is a Lebesgue triple.

In the connection with the above-mentioned results V. Maslyuchenko put the following question.

Does there exist a topological space Z such that [formula] is not a Lebesgue triple?

Here we give the positive answer to this question. Moreover, we prove that (X,Y,Z) is not a Lebesgue triple for topological spaces X and Y of a wide class of spaces, which includes, in particular, all spaces [formula], and for a space Z = X  ×  Y endowed with the cross-topology (see definitions in Section [\ref=sec:2]). In Sections [\ref=sec:2] and [\ref=sec:3] we give some auxiliary properties of this topology. Section [\ref=sec:4] contains a proof of the main result. In the last section we show that connectedness-like conditions on spaces X and Y in the main result are essential. We prove that (X,Y,Z) is a Lebesgue triple when X is a strongly zero-dimensional metrizable space, Y and Z are arbitrary topological spaces.

Compact sets in the cross-topology

Let X and Y be topological spaces. We denote by γ the collection of all subsets A of X  ×  Y such that for every point (x,y) of A there exist such neighborhoods U and V of x and y in X and Y, respectively, that [formula]. The system γ forms a topology on X  ×  Y, which is called the cross-topology. A product X  ×  Y with the cross-topology we denote by (X  ×  Y,γ).

For a point p = (x,y)∈X  ×  Y by cross(p) we denote the set [formula]. For an arbitrary A  ⊆  X  ×  Y let [formula].

Let X andY be T1-spaces and (pn)∞n = 1 a sequence of points pn = (xn,yn)∈X  ×  Y such that xn  ≠  xm and yn  ≠  ym if n  ≠  m. Then [formula] is a γ-discrete set.

Since every one-point subset of X or of Y is closed, P is γ-closed. Similarly, every subset Q  ⊆  P is also γ-closed. Hence, P is closed discrete subspace of (X  ×  Y,γ).

Let X and Y be T1-spaces and let K  ⊆  X  ×  Y be a γ-compact set. Then there exists a countable set A  ⊆  X  ×  Y such that K  ⊆  cross(A).

Assume that [formula] for any finite set A  ⊆  X  ×  Y. We choose an arbitrary point p1∈K and by the induction on [formula] we construct a sequence of points pn∈K such that [formula], where Pn  =  {pk:1  ≤  k  ≤  n} for every [formula]. According to Proposition [\ref=pr:1] the set [formula] is infinite γ-discrete in K which contradicts the fact that K is γ-compact.

Let X and Y be T1-spaces and let A and B be discrete sets in X and Y, respectively. Then the topology of product τ and the cross-topology γ coincide on the set C = cross(A  ×  B).

Fix p = (x,y)∈C. Using the discreteness of A and B, we choose such neighborhoods U and V of x and y in X and Y, respectively, that [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] for some point c∈C. Then τ  =  γ on the set [formula].

Propositions [\ref=pr:2] and [\ref=pr:3] immediately imply the following characterization of γ-compact sets.

Let X and Y be T1-spaces and K  ⊆  X  ×  Y. Then K is γ-compact if and only if when

K is compact;

K  ⊆  cross(C) for a finite set C  ⊆  X  ×  Y.

Connected sets and cross-mappings

Let X and Y be connected spaces, A a dense subset of X, let Ø  ≠  B  ⊆  Y and C  ⊆  X  ×  Y be such sets that cross(A  ×  B)  ⊆  C. Then C is connected.

Let U and V be open subsets of C such that [formula]. Since X and Y are connected, for every p∈A  ×  B either cross(p)  ⊆  U, or cross(p)  ⊆  V. Since [formula] for distinct points p,q∈X  ×  Y, cross(A  ×  B)  ⊆  U or cross(A  ×  B)  ⊆  V. Taking into account that cross(A  ×  B) is dense in X  ×  Y, and consequently, in C, we obtain that C  ⊆  U or C  ⊆  V. Therefore, [formula] or [formula]. Hence, C is connected.

Let X and Y be infinite connected T1-spaces. Then the complement to any finite subset of X  ×  Y is connected.

Let C  ⊆  X  ×  Y be a finite set. We choose finite sets A  ⊆  X and B  ⊆  Y such that C  ⊆  A  ×  B. Remark that [formula] and [formula] are dense in X and Y, respectively, and [formula]. It remains to apply Proposition [\ref=pr:3.1].

A topological space X is said to be a C1-space (or a space with the property C1), if the complement to any finite subset has finite many components.

Let us observe that the real line [formula] has the property C1. Moreover, a finite product of C1-spaces is a C1-space.

Let X and Y be topological spaces and P  ⊆  X  ×  Y. A mapping f:P  →  X  ×  Y is called a cross-mapping, if f(p)  ⊆  cross(p) for every p∈P.

Let X and Y be Hausdorff spaces, U  ⊆  X, V  ⊆  Y, let f:U  ×  V  →  X  ×  Y be a continuous cross-mapping, let A  ⊆  X and B  ⊆  Y be finite sets and the following conditions hold:

U, V be connected C1-spaces;

f(U  ×  V)  ⊆  cross(A  ×  B).

Then either f(U  ×  V)  ⊆  {a}  ×  Y for some a∈A, or f(U  ×  V)  ⊆  X  ×  {b} for some b∈B.

If both U and V are finite, then (1) imply that U and V are one-point sets and the lemma follows from (2). If U is finite (one-point) and V is infinite, then [formula] is finite clopen subset of U  ×  V. The connectedness of U  ×  V implies F = Ø. Hence, f(U  ×  V)  ⊆  A  ×  Y. Since f is continuous, f(U  ×  V)  ⊆  {a}  ×  Y for some a∈A.

Now let U and V be infinite. Then it follows from (1) that U and V have no isolated points. Since [formula] and [formula] are closed and nowhere dense in U and V, respectively, the set

[formula]

is closed and nowhere dense in Z = U  ×  V.

Let α:U  ×  V  →  X and β:U  ×  V  →  Y be continuous functions such that f(x,y) = (α(x,y),β(x,y)) for all (x,y)∈Z. Put

[formula]

Notice that

[formula]

is nowhere dense in Z. Therefore, [formula] is dense in intZ(Zα), where by intZ(D) we denote the interior of D  ⊆  Z in Z, and by [formula] we denote the closure of D in Z. Condition (2) implies that Qα is contained in the closed set {z∈Z:β(z)∈B}. Hence,

[formula]

i.e. [formula]. Similarly, [formula].

Since f is a cross-mapping, [formula]. Remark that Zα and Zβ are closed in Z. Let

[formula]

Taking into account that C is closed and nowhere dense in Z, we have that G is open and dense in Z. According to (1) the sets [formula] and [formula] has finite many components, therefore, the set [formula] has finite many components [formula]. Then [formula], where all Gi are closed in G. Hence, all the sets Gi are clopen in G, in particular, open in Z. Notice that [formula]. Thus, [formula]. Then [formula], consequently Gi  ⊆  Zα or Gi  ⊆  Zβ for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. Let

[formula]

[formula]

Remark that

[formula]

Hence, for any [formula] we have α(x,y) = x and β(x,y)∈B. Similarly, α(x,y)∈A and β(x,y) = y for every [formula]. Therefore, z = f(z)∈A  ×  B for any [formula]. Consequently, [formula] is finite.

Denote [formula] and [formula]. Since by Proposition [\ref=pr:3.1] the set [formula] is connected, nonempty and [formula], taking into account that [formula] and [formula], we obtain E = Ø or D = Ø. Assume that E = Ø. Then Uβ is dense in Z and

[formula]

Since U  ×  V is connected, f(U  ×  V) is connected too, therefore, there is such a∈A that f(U  ×  V)  ⊆  {a}  ×  Y.

The main result

Let X and Y be T1-spaces, z0∈X  ×  Y and let (zn)∞n = 1 be γ-convergent to z0 sequence of points zn = (xn,yn)∈X  ×  Y. Then there exists [formula] such that zn∈cross(z0) for all n  ≥  m.

Assume the contrary. Then by the induction on [formula] it is easy to construct a strictly increasing sequence of numbers [formula] such that xni  ≠  xnj and yni  ≠  ynj for distinct [formula], and [formula] for all [formula]. Now the sequence (pk)∞k = 1 of points pk = znk converges to z0, and from the other side the set [formula] is a neighborhood of z0, a contradiction.

A system A of subsets of a topological space X is called a π-pseudobase [\cite=Tall], if for every nonempty open set U  ⊆  X there exists a set A∈A such that [formula] and A  ⊆  U.

Let X and Y be Hausdorff spaces without isolated points and let X and Y have π-pseudobases which consist of connected compact C1-sets, and let f:X  ×  Y  →  X  ×  Y be the identical mapping. Then [formula].

Assuming the contrary, we choose a sequence of continuous functions fn:X  ×  Y  →  (X  ×  Y,γ) such that fn(x,y)  →  (x,y) in (X  ×  Y,γ) for all (x,y)∈X  ×  Y.

Remark that every fn:X  ×  Y  →  X  ×  Y is continuous. Then for every [formula] the set Pn  =  {p∈X  ×  Y:fn(p)∈cross(p)} is closed. Hence, for every [formula] the set

[formula]

is closed too. Moreover, by Proposition [\ref=pr:4.1]

[formula]

The conditions of the theorem imply that Z = X  ×  Y has a π-pseudobase of compact sets. Then the product contains an open everywhere dense locally compact subspace, in particular, the product X  ×  Y is Baire. We choose a number [formula] and compact connected C1-sets U  ⊆  X and V  ⊆  Y such that U  ×  V  ⊆  Fn0, [formula] and [formula].

Let W = U  ×  V. According to Proposition [\ref=pr:4], there exist such sequences of finite sets An  ⊆  X and Bn  ⊆  Y that [formula] for every [formula]. Since X and Y have no isolated points, the sets U0 and V0 are infinite. Take such points p1 = (x1,y1),p2 = (x2,y2)∈U0  ×  V0 that [formula]. Since X and Y are Hausdorff, there exist neighborhoods U1 and U2 of x1 and x2 in U0 and neighborhoods V1 and V2 of y1 and y2 in V0, respectively, such that [formula]. Now we choose a number N  ≥  n0 such that fN(p1)∈U1  ×  V1 and fN(p2)∈U2  ×  V2.

Since fN|W is a cross-mapping, Lemma [\ref=l:2] implies that fN(W)  ⊆  {a}  ×  Y for some a∈A or fN(W)  ⊆  X  ×  {b} for some b∈B. Assume that fN(W)  ⊆  {a}  ×  Y for some a∈X. Then [formula] and [formula]. Therefore, [formula], which is impossible.

Let n,m  ≥  1 and let [formula] be the identical mapping. Then [formula].

The collection [formula] is not a Lebesgue triple for all n,m  ≥  1.

Separately continuous mappings on zero-dimensional spaces

Recall that a nonempty topological space X is strongly zero-dimensional, if it is completely regular and every finite functionally open cover of X has a finite disjoint open refinement [\cite=Eng].

Let X be a strongly zero-dimensional metrizable space, let Y and Z be topological spaces. Then (X,Y,Z) is a Lebesgue triple.

Let d be a metric on X, which generates its topology. For every [formula] we consider an open cover Bn of X by balls of the diameter [formula]. It follow from [\cite=Ellis] that every Bn has locally finite clopen refinement Un = (Uα,n:0  ≤  α  <  βn). For all [formula] let V0,n = U0,n and [formula] if α > 0. Then Vn = (Vα,n:0  ≤  α  <  βn) is a locally finite disjoint cover of X by clopen sets Vα,n which refines Bn.

Let f:X  ×  Y  →  Z be a separately continuous function. For all [formula] and 0  ≤  α  <  βn we choose a point xα,n∈Vα,n. Let us consider functions fn:X  ×  Y  →  Z defined as the following:

[formula]

if x∈Vα,n and y∈Y. Clearly, for every [formula] the function fn is jointly continuous, provided f is continuous with respect to the second variable. We show that fn(x,y)  →  f(x,y) on X  ×  Y. Fix (x,y)∈X  ×  Y and choose a sequence (αn)∞n = 1 such that x∈Vαn,n. Since diamVαn,n  →  0, xαn,n  →  x. Taking into account that f is continuous with respect to the first variable, we obtain that

[formula]

Hence, f∈B1(X  ×  Y,Z).
