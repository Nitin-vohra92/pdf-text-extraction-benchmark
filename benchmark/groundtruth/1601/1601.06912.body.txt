Introduction

Since Abell (1958) and Zwicky (1961) we have known that the most massive clusters are also the richest. A precise quantification of the relation between mass and richness and, in particular, of the scatter between them has taken a long time to be established because direct estimates of mass not relying on hydrostatic or dynamical equilibrium, such as caustic (Diaferio & Geller 1997) or lensing (Broadhurst, Taylor, & Peacock, 1995) masses, has only recently become available and robust (e.g., Serra et al. 2011, von der Linden 2014a).

This quantification is still in progress for most richness estimates. For example, "maxBCG" richnesses (Koester et al. 2007) a) include fore/background galaxies among cluster galaxies (Koester et al. 2007; Andreon & Hurn 2010); b) count galaxies within a noisy radius on average two times larger than r200 (Becker et al. 2007; Johnston et al. 2007; Sheldon et al. 2009; Andreon & Hurn 2010); c) use an incorrect center 30% of the time (e.g., Johnston et al. 2007; Andreon & Moretti 2011); and d) for these reasons show redshift-dependent systematics (Becker et al. 2007; Rykoff et al. 2008; Rozo et al. 2009; Andreon & Hurn 2010; Andreon & Moretti 2011). Some other richnesses lack a mass calibration (e.g., those in Budzynski et al. 2014), have a preliminary one (e.g., those in Rykoff et al. 2014), have an unknown scatter with mass (e.g., those in Wiesner et al. 2015, Ford et al. 2015, and Oguri 2015), or a yet unquantified evolution (e.g., those in Koester et al. 2007). In these conditions, as for the "maxBCG" richnesses mentioned above or for richnesses in Rykoff et al. 2014 (see Andreon 2015 for the latter), systematics may appear. Not fully calibrated richnesses are not ready to be used to estimate cluster masses.

Other mass proxies share some of these shortcomings. For example, the integrated pressure YX used by Vikhlinin et al. (2009) to estimate cluster masses and, from these data cosmological parameters, has a yet uncharacterized evolution. In fact, Israel et al. (2014) found an higher normalization interpreted as possibly due to a Malmquist bias. The current calibration of the YSZ mass proxy returns cosmological parameters different from those derived mostly from the cosmic microwave background, which could suggest a calibration problem of up to 0.2 dex (Planck collaboration 2015), or, using independent data, a mass bias (von der Linden 2014b) or a neglected evolution (Andreon 2014). The mass calibration of the South Pole significance parameter largely relies on simulations, given the scarcity of real data (Bocquet et al. 2015).

One proxy, n200, seems to be in better shape - it has a well-determined mean scaling, a known and small scatter, and a known and negligible evolution - as a result of calibration efforts using caustic masses from the Cluster Infall Regions (Rines et al. 2006), Hectospec Cluster Surveys (Rines et al. 2013), and weak lensing masses from Canadian Cluster Comparison Project (Hoekstra et al. 2012). A negligible scatter (0.02 dex) between a properly measured number of red galaxies and mass has been found around the relation

[formula]

with a tight upper limit on evolution with redshift up to z = 0.55 once the passive evolution of the red galaxies is accounted for (Andreon & Hurn 2010, Andreon & Congdon 2014, Andreon 2015). This 0.02 dex intrinsic scatter in mass is comparable to or better than the values derived for other proxies, such as the integrated pressure YSZ or pseudo pressure YX, X-ray luminosity LX, gas mass Mgas, and stellar mass (Andreon 2015). The n200 proxy performance, 0.16 dex, is comparable to or better than YSZ, maxBCG n200 (Andreon 2015), and LX (Andreon & Hurn 2010). We note that Eq. 1 refers to n200 values measured according to the prescriptions of Andreon & Hurn (2010) and not to other richness measurements even if they share the same symbol, such as "maxBCG" richnesses (Koester et al. 2007).

A small scatter between proxy and mass makes the proxy useful for predicting the mass of a cluster without a direct mass estimate. However, given that the proxy has to be measured within an aperture which is nothing else than a mass expressed in different units (for example, r200 = M1 / 3200 apart from obvious coefficients), an effective way to estimate the reference aperture (r200) is needed in order to use proxies to estimate masses. Andreon (2015) applies Kravtsov et al. (2006) idea of inferring both M200 and r200 at the same time exploiting the tight mass-proxy scaling. This was shown to minimally degrade the performance of richness as a way to estimate mass, leading to richness-based masses with 0.16 dex errors (Andreon 2015). The observationally inexpensive richness can therefore be used to estimate the mass of large samples of clusters for which either direct estimates are unavailable, are impossible to obtain, or just are not necessary. Unlike other mass proxies affected by dynamical or hydrostatic non-equilibrium, the cluster richness (the number of red galaxies) has the further advantage of also providing the mass of clusters out of equilibrium (interacting, merging, etc.).

A large sample of clusters with homogeneously derived and calibrated masses has many possible uses: 1) understanding how cluster properties scale with mass; 2) performing other measurements of radial-dependent quantities at a fixed reference radius, such as the fraction of blue galaxies or the X-ray luminosity in a standardized aperture (as mentioned, r200 can be simply derived from the M200); 3) normalizing measurements whose definition requires knowledge of mass such as the star formation density; 4) combining clusters of different masses (and therefore sizes); 5) making available for study a larger sample of clusters with masses, allowing the characterization of trends that are hard to identify with smaller samples; 6) calibrating or checking the calibration of other mass proxies; etc.

In this paper, we measure the mass of 275 clusters at 0.05 < z < 0.22 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (hereafter SDSS) footprint at high Galactic latitude. This measurement requires that we first improve the approximate center and redshift of some of them. During the analysis, we also discover pairs of clusters on almost the same line of sight, which we list for later use (some other mass proxies and direct mass estimates are badly affected by this type of blends, such as weak lensing and SZ masses). The resulting sample differs from many catalogs of clusters with known richness because the reduced scatter of the adopted richness and the known calibration with mass allow us to derive accurate (0.16 dex) masses.

The appendix compares richness-based masses to SZ-based masses for 107 clusters. To perform this comparison, we solve the common, yet unsolved, problem of minimizing the sensitivity of conclusions to the specific overlapping of the considered samples.

Throughout this paper, we assume ΩM = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7, and H0 = 70 km s- 1 Mpc- 1. Magnitudes are in the AB system, and all logarithms are in base 10. We use the 2003 version of the Bruzual & Charlot (2003) stellar population synthesis models with solar metallicity, a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF), and zf = 3.

Cluster sample and derivation of cluster richness and mass

Our starting sample considers clusters satisfying the following four conditions (logical "and" operator):

Thet are listed a) in the Piffaretti et al. (2011) compilation of X-ray detected clusters and with [formula] erg s- 1 in the 0.1-2.4 keV band, where the X-ray threshold value is set to focus on massive clusters; b) in the Planck 2015 Catalog of Sunyaev-Zeldovich Sources (Planck collaboration 2015); c) among clusters with at least 35 references in NED and |b| > 30 deg; and d) the Abell (1957) clusters with a redshift in NED and |b| > 30 deg.

They are well inside the SDSS 12th data release (Alam et al. 2015) footprint, i.e., with centers more than 1 deg away from the SDSS boundary, and not severely masked by bright stars.

They have a redshift in the range 0.05 < z < 0.22, the lower redshift boundary being set by the SDSS shredding problem, the high redshift boundary by the SDSS depth.

They have low Galactic extinction, defined as Ar < 0.5 mag.

For each of these clusters, we derive n200 (richness) and, in turn, mass M200 strictly following Andreon (2015) to which we refer for details. Basically, we count red members within a specified luminosity range (only galaxies whose passive evolved magnitude is brighter than MV,z = 0 =  - 20 mag) and color range (within 0.1 redward and 0.2 blueward in g - r of the color-magnitude relation, our operational definition of "red"), as already done for other clusters (e.g., Andreon & Hurn 2010; Andreon et al. 2014). For each cluster, we extracted the galaxy catalogs from the SDSS 12th data release (Alam et al. 2015) and we used "cmodel" magnitudes for total galaxy magnitudes and "model" magnitude for colors. Colors are corrected for the color-magnitude slope (but this is a minor correction given the small magnitude range explored). Fig. 1 shows, for the third nearest and most distant clusters, the color distribution and the adopted color ranges.

Some of the red galaxies in the cluster line of sight are actually in the cluster fore/background. The contribution from background galaxies is estimated, as usual, from a reference direction (e.g., Zwicky 1957; Oemler 1974; Andreon, Punzi & Grado 2005). The reference direction is formed by three octants, free of contaminating structures (other clusters) and not badly affected by the SDSS imaging masks, of a corona centered on the studied cluster with inner radius 3 Mpc and outer radius 1 (if z > 0.07) or 2 (otherwise) degree(s), hence fully guaranteeing homogeneous data for cluster and control field. The color distribution of background galaxies, normalized to the cluster solid angle, is shown in Fig. 1 for the two example clusters.

The centers given in the literature are sometimes imprecise: Abell (1958) estimated them by eye, Planck has a poor point spread function and therefore large (1.5 arcmin) positional errors, and Piffaretti et al. and NED collect positions derived with a variety of methods from various sources sometimes having poor resolution or affected by unrelated point sources (as the Rosat All Sky Survey is). We estimate the cluster center iteratively as the median values of right ascension and declination of red galaxies within an aperture of 1.0 Mpc radius, starting the iteration on the literature center. We then iterate 11 times and take the last value as the final center. The initial and final center are indicated in Fig. 2 for the two example clusters. Andreon (2015) showed that results do not change when using another number of iterations because convergence is achieved earlier, whereas in Sec. 4 we show that the starting position does not matter when using duplicate clusters (objects with center offsets larger than 3 arcmin in different cluster catalogs, and therefore listed twice in our initial list of clusters to be analyzed). We note, however, that X-ray, SZ, and other types of optical centers may legitimately be different from our centers based on galaxy numbers.

As mentioned, the r200 radius is unknown for the studied clusters. We adopt, as proposed in Andreon (2015) for richness and in Kravtsov et al. (2006) for YX, an iterative approach to its determination, which exploits the almost scatter-less nature of the richness-mass relation: a radius r is taken (1.4 Mpc in our case), n( < r) estimated, then r is updated to the value appropriate for the derived richness (i.e., using eq. 1, and noting that r200 = M1 / 3200 apart from obvious coefficients) and then the process is iterated 3 times. This procedure returns M200 with a total scatter of only 0.16 dex from true (Andreon 2015). The derived r200 is shown (inner circle) for the two example clusters in Fig. 2. In Andreon (2015) we show that adopting a different number of iterations does not change the results because convergence occurs earlier.

Since the mass-redshift relation is known to hold for [formula] (and we ignore if it holds at lower masses), only clusters more massive than this threshold are kept in the sample. To be more precise, the applied cut is log n200 > 21.6. This leave us with a sample of 275 clusters. Figure 3 and 4 show the distribution of these 275 clusters in the sky and in the redshift-mass plane.

The values of masses derived in this way are listed in Table 1 (entirely available in electronic form at the CDS and also at http://www.brera.mi.astro.it/~  andreon/famous.html with a front-end to the SDSS imaging service). These masses are the prime result of this work: while many literature papers report richnesses for cluster samples, these richnesses have a larger scatter with mass, often with an unknown or problematic mass calibration. The current work instead uses a precisely calibrated richness-mass scaling using a small scatter proxy. Radii can be derived using the M200 definition, whereas the originally measured richnesses are also listed. We remember that richness is within a cylinder of radius r200, whereas mass is deprojected (i.e., within a sphere) because the calibration, i.e., Eq. 1, returns the latter as a function of the former. Table 1 also lists other known identifications of the studied clusters when their reported coordinates are within 3.0 arcmin from the center determined in this work (5.0 armin for Abell 1957 and NED). The angular offset, in arcmin, is reported in parentheses. Table 2 shows the number of clusters in each subsample (Piffaretti et al. 2011, Planck 2015, Abell 1957 and NED) and in their overlaps. Comments to a few individual clusters are listed in Appendix A.

Equation 1, used to estimate mass from richness, has a zero evolutionary term, in agreement with the small and statistically insignificant term determined in Andreon (2015), [formula], and with the tighter constraint derived in Andreon & Congdon (2014). A ten times larger term, 1.0, would induces a systematic error of [formula] dex across the studied redshift range, negligible compared to our quoted error 0.16 dex. For this reason, we neglected the [formula] evolutionary term found in Andreon (2015).

Can we apply the calibrating mass-richness relation to different cluster samples?

The mass calibration in Andreon (2015), i.e., Eq. 1, uses the observed number of galaxies to predict the mass of the cluster, and has been derived for a calibrating sample with a given selection function. One may therefore wonder if this may be used for the current, target, sample with a different selection function. The answer is yes, as we now illustrate. We consider the general case of a proxy x whose observed value has been calibrated against mass M

[formula]

with some scatter σx, where we have absorbed in x the intercept and the possibly non-zero slope as well as the effect of the selection function and steep mass function of the calibrating sample. This relation does not change when another variable yobs showing some scatter σy with log M

[formula]

is considered, available, and satisfies some constraints, which means that the cluster is included in the target sample. In fact, for each individual cluster, the relation in Eq. 2 is unaltered, neither the value of xobs nor M changes because another cluster property yobs is measured. The quantity xobs still provides an unbiased estimate of the cluster mass via Eq. 2. This make us free to use Eq. 2 (and Eq. 1, which has the coefficients explicitely given) for a sample selected by another observable.

However, the data cloud satisfying the selection on yobs can obey a different relation as a result of sample selection effects. This can be easily understood when only log M > 15 clusters are kept in the sample, and where mass is estimated from a proxy y with negligible scatter with mass. At low xobs the M - xobs relation would no longer decrease with xobs, but instead would flatten at [formula] because clusters with log M < 15 are excluded by the selection (and log M  ≫  15 with low xobs become exceptionally rare). Eq. 2 still provides an unbiased mass, but because of important selection effects the proxy vs mass trend of the selected sample will appear to differ from a linear relation with slope one and zero offset, as detailed for the Planck subsample in Appendix B.

We also emphasize that while richness, and therefore richness-based masses, does not depend on the cluster status, other mass proxies assume a hydrostatic or dynamical equilibrium and are affected by an unknown hydrostatic bias. This too may lead to a possible systematic offset, or scatter, with our richness-based masses.

Value-added features of the cluster catalog

When deriving cluster masses we performed an extensive set of quality controls. Basically, every plot shown in this paper has been inspected for each and every cluster; SDSS images were inspected as well as individual spectra of the most important galaxies (typically the brightest cluster galaxy). During these controls we noted the following:

The cluster redshift listed in the literature (which comes from a variety of sources, including photometric redshift and perhaps sometimes from the redshift of one single galaxy) is inaccurate for 21 clusters by an amount that is easy to note for at least one of two reasons. First, the observed red sequence is not at the expected color. This is illustrated in Fig. 5 for Abell 1182: the observed red sequence is bluer than it should be for a z = 0.166 cluster. Indeed, the cluster is at z = 0.148, based on SDSS spectroscopy, a [formula] offset from the literature (photometric in this case) redshift. If not corrected for, such a small offset might lead to an overestimation of the cluster mass of 0.09 dex, smaller than our quoted mass error. We note that on some rare occasions redshift offsets as small as Δz = 0.004 (as for Abell 1045, also known as MCXCJ1034.9+3041) have been detected from the color offset. Second, we queried the spectroscopic SDSS database and checked whether the redshift peak of the galaxies within r200 lies at the literature redshift. If not, we updated the literature redshift (an example is shown in Fig. 6, also in this case the redshift change lead to a negligible mass change). Of course, cluster parameters in Table 1 are estimated with the revised redshift, although this is a negligible correction.

Ten clusters listed in the literature are, on the r200 spatial scale, blends of widely separated (Δv  >  1500 km/s) clusters on the same, or nearby, line(s) of sight. These are recognized for having two red sequences at different colors and, when sufficient spectroscopic data are available, two or more redshift peaks (see Fig. 7 for an example). The ten blends are listed in Table C.1. This list constitutes a further result of this work because these clusters are likely blended in SZ too given the large Planck PSF and the lack of redshift sensitivity, as well as in weak-lensing analysis (again because of the poor redshift sensitivity of shear). Indeed, one of this pair (Abell750/MS0906) is a known case of lensing blending (Geller et al. 2013). Seven out of ten have been detected via their intracluster medium in emission. Therefore, it does not seem that X-ray selected are immune to projection effects as one often reads in literature papers. It is true and obvious, however, that confusion effects are lower when a smaller aperture is adopted, as is compulsory in X-ray because of the shallowness of the signal at large radii and as is also feasible for richness. In fact, the clusters listed in Table C.1 could be not contaminated on smaller spatial scales, such as those probed by the X-ray emission and also by richness data when adopting a smaller aperture.

On three occasions the SDSS photometry is corrupted, probably because of a background subtraction problem. This shows up as a rectangular region in the sky where galaxies are missing or have inappropriate colors for their spectroscopic redshift, notably a red sequence with the wrong color for the SDSS-measured spectroscopic redshift. We found the following clusters affected by the above, and therefore dropped from our list: Abell 1682 (alias MCXCJ1306.9+4633, alias PSZ2G114.99+70.36), Abell 2029 (also noted in Renzini & Andreon 2014), and MCXCJ0751.4+1730 (alias Abell 598).

Checks

A number of checks on the calibration and scatter of the richness-mass relation was done in our previous work using sample with well-measured (caustics, hydrostatic, or weak-lensing) masses. In addition to these,

38 cluster of our initial list of clusters to be analyzed (and with a derived mass larger than [formula]) were analyzed twice because they have center coordinates that differ by more than 3 arcmin (175 to 640 kpc, depending on redshift) in different cluster catalogs. These duplicate clusters (listed only once in our final catalog) are useful for estimating the noise introduced by our mass estimate procedure because they use different background areas and different starting centers. Figure 8 compares mass estimates for these duplicate clusters (there are 40 because two clusters appear in three catalogs). We found a scatter between the different mass estimates of the same cluster almost 10 times smaller than our quoted mass uncertainty. Therefore, the centering procedure and background estimates introduce a negligible error, independently confirming the tests in Andreon (2015).

35 clusters in Table 1 are also in the Hectospec Cluster Surveys (Rines et al. 2013) sample used by Andreon (2015) to calibrate the relation between mass and richness (Eq. 1). The predicted mass, derived in this paper, vs the caustic mass listed in Rines et al. (2013) is shown in Fig. 9. The scatter in mass at a given richness is 0.16 dex, i.e., what we reported in a similar analysis based on almost the same cluster sample. The outlier point is Abell 1068, having a caustic mass in disagreement with past mass measurements (see Andreon 2015 for details). This comparison differs from our past one by the use of a different starting center and, most of the times, a different background area. This comparison shows again that the centering procedure and background estimates introduce a negligible error into our masses. Comparison with caustic masses in the Cluster Infall Regions (Rines et al. 2006) shows a larger scatter because of the known lower precision of the centers used there (Andreon & Hurn 2010; Andreon 2015).

Out of the 71 clusters with YX-based mass listed in Planck Collaboration et al. (2014), 11 are also in Table 1. The mass comparison is shown in Fig. 10. There is a good agreement, except for Abell 1795, a cluster with a complex X-ray morphology (a cavity, a cold front, and a cooling wake; see Walker et al. 2014 and Ehlert et al. 2015 and references therein). Although the agreement is promising, we emphasize once more that because the parent sample (the 71 clusters with YX) does not have a selection function, this comparison should be taken with caution, as discussed in detail for the larger sample of the Planck clusters in our Appendix B.

Summary and conclusions

In this paper we exploit the tight correlation between richness and mass, calibrated on more than one hundred clusters in Andreon (2015). By simply counting the number of red galaxies brighter than the appropriate limit, accounting for the fore/background, we estimated M200 and r200 of a sample of 275 clusters with log n200 > 21.6 corresponding to [formula] in the low-extinction part of the SDSS footprint and with 0.05 < z < 0.22. Position, redshift, and more importantly mass with a 0.16 dex precision is given in Table 1 for the 275 clusters. By adopting a low-scatter well-calibrated mass proxy, this catalog delivers masses whose precision exceeds those available by adopting any of the many proxies, including other richnesses, available in the literature. Our mass measurements are homogeneously derived using homogeneous data, making our catalog different from literature collections of heterogeneous measurements derived with a variety of methods using data of variable quality, such as the Piffaretti et al. (2011) or the Sereno (2015) catalogs.

The derived masses are useful for a variety of purposes: to understand how a cluster property scales with mass, to perform measurements of radial-dependent quantities at a fixed, reference, radius (r200 can be simply derived from the listed M200 values), to normalize measurements whose definition requires knowledge of mass, to combine clusters of different masses, etc. The derived richness-based masses are unaffected by deviation of the cluster from dynamical or hydrostatic equilibrium because the proxy, i.e., the number of red galaxies, is unaffected by these deviations.

During the analysis, a much larger sample of clusters was individually scrutinized: about half of the analyzed clusters turned out to have [formula], several clusters were dropped because severely hidden by bright stars, a revision was needed for about a quarter of the sample (clusters with inaccurate redshifts or widely different centers in different catalogs), and we identify 10 "clusters" that are actually blends, on the r200 angular scale, of clusters at different redshifts on almost the same line of sight. These clusters are listed in Table C.1 for later use (other mass proxies are similarly badly affected).

Finally, in Appendix B we compare richness-based to SZ-based masses. To achieve this purpose, we solve the common, and yet unsolved, problem of minimizing the sensitivity of conclusions to the specific overlapping of the considered samples.

GCwM 14 (Abell 67): possible multiple system

GCwM 188 (Abell 1882) and GCwM 189 (MCXCJ1415.2-0030): these two clusters have the same redshift and have centers that are separated by about the estimated r200. If they are one single cluster, its mass is larger than both quoted values: if they are two separate clusters the quoted masses are overestimated.

GCwM 27, 99, 140, and 225 do not have any known identification in the input catalogs as a result of extreme recentering offsets.
