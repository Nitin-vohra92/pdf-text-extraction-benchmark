Parton Transverse Momentum and Orbital Angular Momentum Distributions

Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM), Lq,g, is generated inside the proton as a consequence of the quark and gluon transverse motion about the system's center of momentum. It has been identified as a critical component in the resolution of the proton spin puzzle [\cite=Jaffe:1989jz], which has constituted a central focus of hadron physics since the seminal EMC experiments demonstrated that quark spin alone cannot account for the proton spin [\cite=Ashman:1987hv] [\cite=Ashman:1989ig]. Understanding OAM in the proton was the original motivation for introducing Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) in Refs. [\cite=Radyushkin:1997ki] [\cite=Ji:1996ek], in that they provided a novel way of accessing angular momentum through a class of exclusive reactions including Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS), Deeply Virtual Meson Production (DVMP), and related experiments. Through Ji's sum rule [\cite=Ji:1996ek], one can, in fact, relate the components of the Energy Momentum Tensor (EMT) known as the gravitomagnetic form factors, Aq,g and Bq,g, to the quark and gluon total angular momenta, Jq,g. The pivotal observation made in [\cite=Ji:1996ek] is that Aq,g and Bq,g correspond to n = 2 Mellin moments of GPDs which, in turn, define the matrix elements for DVCS. These important developments rendered total angular momentum a measurable quantity. Although the decomposition of Jg into its spin and orbital components has proven difficult to define gauge invariantly, the orbital angular momentum of quarks is well defined through Jq = Lq + Sq. Even so, the direct observability of Lq remains a challenging question: the framework defined so far does not tell us how to access the dynamics of quark orbital motion since Lq is only obtained through the difference of the total angular momentum and spin components.

Lq has more recently been associated with precise operators and structure functions, given within two alternative approaches. On one side, a dynamical picture of quark orbital motion was given in terms of a Generalized Transverse Momentum Distribution (GTMD), i.e., an unintegrated over transverse momentum GPD, in Refs. [\cite=Burkardt:2008ua] [\cite=Lorce:2011kd] [\cite=Hatta:2011ku]. The GTMD-based definition of quark OAM is

[formula]

where W  U is a Wigner distribution derived from the quark-quark off-forward correlator in a longitudinally polarized nucleon moving in the 3-direction

[formula]

where Γ denotes an arbitrary γ-matrix structure. W  U is obtained by Fourier-transforming ([\ref=fundcorr]) for Γ  =  γ+ from [formula] to struck quark intrinsic momentum k, projecting onto [formula], as well as from (transverse) momentum transfer ΔT to transverse position bT. If one foregoes the transformation to bT, one can relate LUq to the k2T moment of the GTMD F14 [\cite=Hatta:2011ku] [\cite=Lorce:2011ni] [\cite=Meissner:2009ww] for ΔT  →  0,

[formula]

F14 is a GTMD describing an unpolarized quark inside a longitudinally polarized proton [\cite=Meissner:2009ww]. Finally, U in Eq. ([\ref=fundcorr]) denotes the gauge link, i.e., the Wilson path-ordered exponential connecting the coordinates z and [formula]. We will restrict the discussion in the present Letter to the case of a straight gauge link, corresponding to what is known as Ji's decomposition of angular momentum [\cite=Burkardt:2012sd], and defer the analogous treatment of other relevant gauge link structures to an expanded exposition.

In another approach [\cite=Penttinen:2000dg] [\cite=Kiptily:2002nx] [\cite=Hatta:2012cs], it was observed that OAM is associated with a twist-three GPD, G2. Similar to the treatment of the forward case [\cite=Mulders:1995dh] [\cite=Boer:1997bw] [\cite=Bacchetta:2006tn], one can write the Mellin moments of G2, which appears in the parametrization of the off-forward amplitude, in terms of both twist-two operators and (genuine) twist-three operators. For the second moment, the genuine twist-three contribution vanishes and one obtains, for ΔT  →  0,

[formula]

where only a straight gauge link structure applies in such a relation involving only GPDs. This result can be viewed as an extension of the Efremov-Leader-Teryaev (ELT) sum rule [\cite=Efremov:1996hd], written for the polarized structure functions, to off-forward kinematics.

Notwithstanding these developments, two main problems remain to be solved: 1) relating the two distinct structures, one (F14) appearing at twist two, and one (G2) at twist three, both describing OAM within the same gauge invariant framework; 2) singling out an experimental measurement to access directly OAM, possibly through the newly defined structures. In this Letter, we provide a direct link between the k2T moment of the GTMD and the twist-three GPD describing OAM, elucidating the underlying dependence on partonic intrinsic transverse momentum and off-shellness. The GTMD-based definition is calculable in Lattice QCD using the techniques of Ref. [\cite=Musch:2011er]. On the other side, the twist-three GPD-based definition can be measured directly in DVCS-type experiments, through the azimuthal angle modulations which are sensitive to twist-three GPDs in DVCS off a longitudinally polarized target [\cite=Courtoy:2013oaa]; this is at variance with the notion that transverse polarization, or proton spin-flip processes are necessary to obtain information on quark OAM.

Our central result is the following integral relations ([\ref=relation2],[\ref=relation1]) connecting F14, G2, [formula], H, E and [formula] in the limit ΔT  →  0, where [formula] is a twist-three GPD in the classification of [\cite=Meissner:2009ww] related to the GPD G2 in the classification of [\cite=Kiptily:2002nx] by

[formula]

Eq. ([\ref=relation2]) is a Lorentz Invariance Relation (LIR), obtained from the analysis of the most general Lorentz decomposition of the quark-quark correlation function. It states a remarkable equivalence between the GTMD and twist-three GPD-based definitions.

Eq. ([\ref=relation1]), which integrates over x to give ([\ref=polyakov]), is an Equations of Motion (EoM) relation derived by applying the QCD EoM for the quark fields to the correlation function. Together with Eq. ([\ref=relation2]), it allows one to connect OAM defined through a Wigner distribution, Eq. ([\ref=F14_1]), to the sum rule definition, Eq. ([\ref=polyakov]). In Eq. ([\ref=relation1]), the superscript "WW" denotes the Wandzura-Wilczek part, in analogy to the derivation for the polarized structure functions g1 and g2 [\cite=Wandzura:1977qf]. On the other hand,

[formula]

with [formula] given in Eq. ([\ref=gen3]) below, is a genuine twist-three term - a quark-gluon-quark correlation - whose contribution to angular momentum can be explicitly seen to vanish in the case treated here as a consequence of the underlying structure of Eq. ([\ref=covder]).

We now sketch the derivation of Eqs.([\ref=relation2],[\ref=relation1]), highlighting the role of quark kT and, thus, the off-shellness of partons in generating proton spin. The completely unintegrated off-forward quark-quark correlation function WΓΛ,Λ', i.e., (half) the four-dimensional Fourier transform of ([\ref=fundcorr]) from [formula] to k [\cite=Mulders:1995dh] [\cite=Boer:1997bw] [\cite=Bacchetta:2006tn] [\cite=Goeke:2005hb] [\cite=Meissner:2009ww], can be parametrized [\cite=Meissner:2009ww] in terms of invariant functions Ai. On the other hand, its k- integral [formula] is parametrized by the GTMDs. This implies the following twist-two relations already given in [\cite=Meissner:2009ww], adapted to the straight gauge link, zero skewness case considered here,

[formula]

which we supplement by the twist-three relation

[formula]

Combining integrals over transverse kT of these relations, one arrives at the LIR

[formula]

in the limit ΔT  →  0, having identified the GPD combinations H + E and [formula] resulting after kT integration of the GTMD combinations appearing in ([\ref=f123]) and ([\ref=f278]) [\cite=Meissner:2009ww]. Finally, integrating over x, one arrives at Eq. ([\ref=relation2]).

The EoM relation in Eq. ([\ref=relation1]) was obtained by considering ([\ref=fundcorr]) for Γ = iσi +γ5, (i = 1,2), and inserting the equation of motion for the quark operator (the symmetrized form serving to cancel the mass terms),

[formula]

This yields the relation between k- integrated correlators

[formula]

with the genuine twist-three quark-gluon-quark correlator (still denoting Γ = iσi +γ5), By taking the proton non-flip spin components, (Λ,Λ') = ( + , + )  -  ( - , - ) that identify OAM [\cite=Courtoy:2013oaa], using the GTMD parametrizations [\cite=Meissner:2009ww] of the [formula], and integrating over kT, one has, in the ΔT  →  0 limit,

[formula]

having again identified the GPD [formula] as in the LIR derivation above, as well as the GPD [formula]. The genuine twist-three term [formula] is given by

[formula]

The final expression defining the EoM relation in Eq. ([\ref=relation1]) is obtained by taking the derivative in x, and replacing the k2T moment of F14 with the expression from the LIR in Eq. ([\ref=relation2]).

It should be noted that the relations discussed here are perturbatively divergent and require consistent regularization/renormalization at each step. An interesting aspect, e.g., of the LIR ([\ref=relation2]) is that it connects a GTMD which does not have a GPD limit, F14, to GPDs. To treat both sides on an equal footing implies utilizing a transverse momentum-dependent regularization and renormalization scheme, and thus interpreting the GPDs in terms of the underlying GTMDs of which they are the GPD limit. On the other hand, it seems tempting to speculate that relations of the type ([\ref=relation2]) may ultimately be useful to connect the renormalization of quantities which are intrinsically defined as transverse momentum-dependent, such as F14, to the more standard schemes employed for GPDs.

As an application of the relations between the different ways to access angular momentum, we compile and correlate in Fig. [\ref=fig1] determinations of Jq, Lq and Sq from several sources, including experiment, lattice QCD, and models. The value of Ju - d = Ju - Jd is plotted versus Lu - d = Lu - Ld. The horizontal bands represent measurements/calculations of Ju - d using DVCS data [\cite=Mazouz:2007aa]/GPD evaluations; the slanted band is given by the relation Jq  =  Lq  +  ΔΣq / 2, where the experimental value for ΔΣu - d was taken from Ref. [\cite=Airapetian:2006vy]. The vertical bands correspond to preliminary data for Lq obtained in a lattice QCD calculation at an artificially high pion mass of mπ = 518   using an approach related to the GTMD F14 from Eq. ([\ref=F14_1]) [\cite=poetic:engelhardt], and to a calculation of [formula] in the reggeized diquark model [\cite=Goldstein:2010gu] [\cite=GonzalezHernandez:2012jv]. The lattice result is expected to be enhanced by roughly 30% as one goes to the physical pion mass. The reggeized diquark model produces a parametrization of the GPDs H and E, which is fitted to both the nucleon unpolarized PDFs for the u and d quarks, and to the flavor-separated nucleon electromagnetic form factors [\cite=Cates:2011pz]. An independent experimental constraint on the normalization of the genuine twist-three part of [formula] is obtained by using its third Mellin moment, which can be related to

[formula]

where g2, the transverse spin-dependent structure function, is obtained in double-spin asymmetry measurements of longitudinally polarized electrons scattering from longitudinally and transversely polarized nucleons. We used, in particular, the SLAC data for the u and d quark values of d2 at a common Q2 value of 5 GeV2 [\cite=Anthony:2002hy]. With the normalization of the twist-three part of [formula] obtained from Eq. ([\ref=d2G2]) we then evaluated Lq. The result is the vertical green band. This is consistent, although with a large error, with the values extracted from the lattice. No experimental determinations of Lq to corroborate our analysis can be placed on the graph at this point, although future extractions will be possible from analyses of the sin 2φ modulation of DVCS data [\cite=Courtoy:2013oaa].

In Fig. [\ref=fig3] we exhibit in more detail the contributions in Eq. ([\ref=relation1]) as a function of x, i.e., the behavior of [formula], the genuine twist-three term, and their sum at the initial scale of the model. As for g2, the genuine twist-three part is predicted to be large. Due to the Regge behavior of the functions, we expect measurements at low x, i.e., in a regime which would be best accessible at an Electron Ion Collider to be important.

Finally, future developments will include the extension of our study to the Jaffe-Manohar [\cite=Jaffe:1989jz] decomposition of angular momentum, which, as shown in Ref. [\cite=Burkardt:2012sd], involves a final state interaction (encoded in a staple-shaped gauge link), and is related to the Ji decomposition by

[formula]

where 〈τ3〉 is an off-forward extension of a Qiu-Sterman term [\cite=Qiu:1991pp]. 〈τ3〉 has been interpreted physically as a change in OAM due to a torque - a final state interaction - exerted on the outgoing quark by the color-magnetic field produced by the spectators [\cite=Burkardt:2012sd].

In conclusion, understanding quark OAM entails cross-correlating phenomenology, theory and lattice QCD efforts to bring them to bear simultaneously on the subject. We provided relations that are key for realizing such a coordinated approach, utilizing directly non-local, kT-unintegrated quark-quark correlation functions. This approach opens up an avenue to explore the role of partonic transverse momentum and off-shellness for OAM, while providing a formalism which connects to lattice QCD calculations on one side and to experiment on the other. A first, exploratory direct calculation of quark OAM in lattice QCD using an approach related to the GTMD F14 was incorporated into the analysis, and confronted with independent determinations, e.g., via Ji's sum rule, and through d2 measurements. Our relations bring to the fore the intricacies of connecting a twist-two GTMD moment and a twist-three GPD, before the backdrop of a field theoretic rendition of OAM.
