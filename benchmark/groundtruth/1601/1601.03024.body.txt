Key words: Fusion frames; dual fusion frames; approximate duals; Riesz fusion bases.

Introduction and preliminaries

Fusion frame theory is a natural generalization of frame theory in separable Hilbert spaces, which is introduced by P. G. Casazza and G. Kutyniok in [\cite=Cas04] and also M. Fornasier in [\cite=Forna]. Fusion frames are applied to signal processing, image processing, sampling theory, filter banks and a variety of applications that cannot be modeled by discrete frames [\cite=sensor] [\cite=hear].

Let I be a countable index set, recall that a sequence {fi}i∈I is a frame in a separable Hilbert space H if there exist constants 0 < A  ≤  B <   ∞   such that

[formula]

The constants A and B are called the lower and upper frame bounds, respectively. It is said that {fi}i∈I is a Bessel sequence whenever in equation of ([\ref=Def_frame]), the right-hand side holds. Given a frame {fi}i∈I, the frame operator is defined by

[formula]

It is a bounded, invertible, and self-adjoint operator [\cite=Chr08]. The family {S- 1fi}i∈I is also a frame for H, so called the canonical dual frame. In general, Bessel sequence {gi}i∈I  ⊆  H is called an alternate dual or simply a dual for the Bessel sequence {fi}i∈I if

[formula]

The synthesis operator T:l2  →  H of a Bessel sequence {fi}i∈I is defined by [formula]. By ([\ref=Def_Dual]) two Bessel sequences {fi}i∈I and {gi}i∈I are dual of each other if and only if TGT*F = IH, where TF and TG are the synthesis operators {fi}i∈I and {gi}i∈I, respectively. For more details on the frame theory we refer to [\cite=Ca04] [\cite=Chr08].

Now we review basic definitions and primary results of fusion frames. Throughout this paper, πV denotes the orthogonal projection from Hilbert space H onto a closed subspace V.

Let {Wi}i∈I be a family of closed subspaces of H and {ωi}i∈I a family of weights, i.e. ωi > 0, i∈I. Then {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I is called a fusion frame for H if there exist the constants 0 < A  ≤  B <   ∞   such that

[formula]

The constants A and B are called the fusion frame bounds. If we only have the upper bound in ([\ref=Def._fusion]) we call {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I a Bessel fusion sequence. A fusion frame is called A-tight, if A = B, and Parseval if A = B = 1. If ωi  =  ω for all i∈I, the collection {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I is called ω-uniform and we abbreviate 1- uniform fusion frames as {Wi}i∈I. A family of closed subspaces {Wi}i∈I is called an orthonormal basis for H when [formula] and it is a Riesz decomposition of H, if for every f∈H there is a unique choice of fi∈Wi such that [formula]. Also a family of closed subspaces {Wi}i∈I is called a Riesz fusion basis whenever it is complete for H and there exist positive constants A, B such that for every finite subset J  ⊂  I and arbitrary vector fi∈Wi, we have

[formula]

It is clear that every Riesz fusion basis is a 1- uniform fusion frame for H, and also every fusion frame is a Riesz fusion basis if and only if it is a Riesz decomposition for H, see [\cite=Asgari] [\cite=Cas04].

For every fusion frame a useful local frame is proposed in the following theorem.

[\cite=Cas04] Let {Wi}i∈I be a family of subspaces in H and {ωi}i∈I a family of weights. Then {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I is a fusion frame for H with bounds A and B, if and only if {ωiπWiej}i∈I,j∈J is a frame for H, with the same bounds, where {ej}j∈J is an orthonormal basis for H.

Recall that for each sequence {Wi}i∈I of closed subspaces in H, the space

[formula]

with the inner product

[formula]

is a Hilbert space. For a Bessel fusion sequence {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I of H, the synthesis operator [formula] is defined by Its adjoint operator [formula], which is called the analysis operator, is given by

[formula]

Let {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I be a fusion frame, the fusion frame operator SW:H  →  H is defined by [formula] is a bounded, invertible as well as positive. Hence, we have the following reconstruction formula [\cite=Cas04]

[formula]

The family {(S- 1WWi,ωi)}i∈I, which is also a fusion frame, is called the canonical dual of {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I. In general, a Bessel fusion sequence {(Vi,νi)}i∈I is called dual of {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I if

[formula]

In [\cite=Ar14], it is proved that a Bessel fusion sequence {(Vi,υi)}i∈I is a dual of {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I if and only if TVφvwT*W = IH, where the bounded operator [formula] is given by

[formula]

Moreover, a Bessel fusion sequence V = {(Vi,ωi)}i∈I given by [formula], is dual of {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I in which Ui is a closed subspace of H for all i∈I, [\cite=Leng]. Also for two fusion frames {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I and {(Vi,υi)}i∈I if there exists a mapping [formula], such that TVQT*W  =  IH then {(Vi,υi)}i∈I is called a Q-dual of {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I. It is clear that every dual fusion frame is a φvw-dual. Q-duals are useful tools for establishing reconstruction formula [\cite=Hei14]. For more information on fusion frames we refer the reader to [\cite=Asgari] [\cite=Cas04] [\cite=Cas08].

Approximate duals

Dual fusion frames play a key role in fusion frame theory, however, their explicit computations seem rather intricate. In this section, we introduce the notion of approximate dual for fusion frames and discuss the existence of dual fusion frames from an approximate dual. Moreover, we present a complete characterization of duals of Riesz fusion bases. The notion of approximate dual for discrete frames has been already introduced by Christensen and Laugesen in [\cite=app.], however many of its results are invalid for fusion frames. Throughout this section we consider a Riesz fusion basis as a 1-uniform fusion frame.

First, we recall the notion of approximate dual for discrete frames. Let F  =  {fi}i∈I and G  =  {gi}i∈I be Bessel sequences for H. Then F and G are called approximate dual frames if ||IH  -  TGT*F||  <  1. In this case {(TGT*F)- 1gi} is a dual of F, see [\cite=app.].

Now we introduce approximate duality for fusion frames.

Let {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I be a Bessel fusion sequence. A Bessel fusion sequence {(Vi,υi)}i∈I is called an approximate dual of {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I if

[formula]

Putting

[formula]

Then, we have the following reconstruction formula

[formula]

Let V  =  {(Vi,υi)}i∈I be an approximate dual of a Bessel fusion sequence W  =  {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I. Then W and V are fusion frames.

Let B and D be Bessel bounds of W and V, respectively. Then

[formula]

This follows that

[formula]

A similar argument for {Vi}i∈I shows that,

[formula]

The following proposition describes approximate duality of fusion frames with respect to local frames.

Let {ej}j∈J be an orthonormal basis of H. The Bessel sequence V  =  {(Vi,υi)}i∈I is an approximate dual of W  =  {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I if and only if {υiπViej}i∈I,j∈J is an approximate dual of {ωiπWiS- 1Wej}i∈I,j∈J.

For each f∈H we have

[formula]

This implies that F  =  {ωiπWiS- 1Wej}i∈I,j∈J is a Bessel sequence for H. Similarly, G  =  {υiπViej}i∈I,j∈J is also Bessel sequence for H. Moreover,

[formula]

for all f∈H. This completes the proof.

The above proposition fails if we replace the local frames by two general local frames, see Example 3.3 and Example 3.4 of [\cite=Ar14].

Let W  =  {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I and V  =  {(Vi,υi)}i∈I be Bessel sequences, also {gi,j}j∈Ji be a frame for Vi with bounds Ai and Bi for every i∈I such that 0  <  a  =   inf i∈IAi. Then V is an approximate dual of W if and only if G  =  {υigi,j}i∈I,j∈Ji is an approximate dual of [formula] where [formula] is the canonical dual of {gi,j}j∈Ji.

We first show that F is a Bessel sequence for H. Indeed, for each f∈H

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

This completes the proof.

The following theorem shows that we can construct a dual fusion frame from a given approximate dual for a Riesz fusion basis.

Let {Wi}i∈I be a Riesz fusion basis and {Vi}i∈I an approximate dual of {Wi}i∈I. Then the sequence {ψ- 1vwVi}i∈I is a dual of {Wi}i∈I.

Suppose that {ei,j}j∈Ji is an orthonormal basis of Wi for each i∈I. Then F: = {ei,j}i∈I,j∈Ji is a frame for H by Theorem 3.2 of [\cite=Cas04]. Due to the Bessel inequality for each f∈H we obtain

[formula]

Thus, G: = {πViS- 1Wei,j}i∈I,j∈Ji is also a Bessel sequence for H. Moreover,

[formula]

Applying Proposition [\ref=app.wrt.local] we deduce that G is an approximate dual of F. This implies that {(TGT*F)- 1πViS- 1Wei,j}i∈I,j∈Ji is a dual for {ei,j}i∈I,j∈Ji. On the other hand the sequence {ei,j}i∈I,j∈Ji is a Riesz basis for H by Theorem 3.6 of [\cite=Asgari]. Using the fact that discrete Riesz bases have only one dual we obtain

[formula]

Furthermore, it is not difficult to see that SF  =  SW and the above calculations shows that TGT*F  =  ψvw. By Substituting ψvw and SW in ([\ref=psi.TGTF*]), we finally conclude that

[formula]

In particular,

[formula]

It immediately follows that {ψ- 1vwVi}i∈I is a dual of {Wi}i∈I.

By the above theorem we can obtain a complete characterization of all duals of a Riesz fusion basis. A particular case of this corollary for finite Q-dual fusion frames has been proved in [\cite=Hei15].

Let {Wi}i∈I be a Riesz fusion basis. A Bessel sequence {Vi}i∈I is an dual of {Wi}i∈I if and only if

[formula]

Particularly, Corollary [\ref=al.Riesz] shows that, unlike discrete frames, Riesz fusion bases may have more than one dual. In the next proposition, we show that every fusion frame has at least an alternate dual.

Every fusion frame has an alternate dual.

Let {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I be a fusion frame with frame operator SW. First suppose that there exists i0∈I such that Wi0  ≠  H. Take Vi = S- 1WWi for i  ≠  i0 and [formula] where [formula] is an arbitrary closed subspace. Obviously {(Vi,ωi)}i∈I is an alternate dual of {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I. Indeed

[formula]

On the other hand, assume that Wi  =  H for all i∈I. It immediately follows that {ωi}i∈I∈l2. Take V1  =  H and Vi  =  {0} for i  >  1, and assume that [formula] and νi  =  ωi for i  >  1. Then [formula] and for every f∈H we have

[formula]

This shows that {(Vi,νi)}i∈I is an alternate dual of {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I.

Let W  =  {Wi}i∈I be a Riesz decomposition. Consider

[formula]

we claim that V  =  {(Vi,υi)}i∈I is dual of {Wi}i∈I, for every {υi}i∈I∈l2(I). Take fi∈Wi, since {S- 1 / 2WWi}i∈I is an orthogonal family of subspaces in H so S- 1Wfi∈Vi. Hence Vi  ⊇  S- 1WWi, for every i∈I and so V is a dual of W by Corollary [\ref=al.Riesz]. In fact, this dual is the unique maximal biorthogonal sequence for {Wi}i∈I, see also Proposition 4.3 in [\cite=Cas04].

If {Wi}i∈I is a Riesz fusion basis, by Theorem 3.9 in [\cite=Asgari], there exists an orthonormal fusion basis {Ui}i∈I and a bounded bijective operator T:H  →  H for which TUi  =  Wi for all i∈I. Therefore the canonical dual of a Riesz fusion basis is also a Riesz fusion basis. In the next theorem, we show that other alternate duals of {Wi}i∈I are not Riesz fusion basis.

Let W = {Wi}i∈I be a Riesz fusion basis in H. The only dual of W which is Riesz fusion basis is the canonical dual.

Suppose {Vi}i∈I is a dual of {Wi}i∈I. By Corollary [\ref=al.Riesz], S- 1WWi  ⊆  Vi for all i∈I. Assume that there exists j∈I such that S- 1WWj  ⊂  Vj, pick up a non-zero [formula]. Since {S- 1WWi}i∈I is a Riesz fusion basis we can choose a unique sequence {gi}i∈I such that [formula] where gi∈S- 1WWi for all i∈I. Therefore, the vector f has two representations of the elements in the Riesz fusion basis {Vi}i∈I which is a contradiction. Hence Vi  =  S- 1WWi for every i∈I. The converse is obvious.

Suppose L∈B(H) is invertible and {(Vi,υi)}i∈I is a dual (approximate dual) of W  =  {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I. It is very natural to ask whether {(LVi,υi)}i∈I is a dual (approximate dual) of {(LWi,ωi)}i∈I.

Let W  =  {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I be a fusion frame and L∈B(H) be invertible such that L*LWi  ⊆  Wi for every i∈I. The following are hold:

If V  =  {(Vi,υi)}i∈I is a dual of W. Then LV  =  {(LVi,υi)}i∈I is a dual of LW  =  {(LWi,ωi)}i∈I.

If V is an approximate dual of W such that,

[formula]

Then LV is an approximate dual of LW.

The sequence {(LWi,ωi)}i∈I is a fusion frame with the frame operator LSWL- 1 and πLWi  =  LπWiL- 1, see [\cite=Cas08]. Therefore, for each f∈H we obtain

[formula]

This proves (i). To show (ii) first note that ψLv,Lw  =  LψvwL- 1, hence

[formula]

for all f∈H. The proof is therefore complete.

Stability of approximate duals

The stability of approximate dual of discrete frames and g-frames can be found in [\cite=app.] [\cite=khosravi]. In the following, we discuss on the stability of approximate dual fusion frames.

Let {Wi}i∈I and [formula] be closed subspaces in H. Also let {ωi}i∈I be positive numbers and ε  >  0. We call [formula] a ε-perturbation of {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I whenever for every f∈H,

[formula]

Let V  =  {(Vi,υi)}i∈I be an approximate dual of a Bessel fusion sequence W  =  {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I. Also let {(Ui,υi)}i∈I be a ε-perturbation of V , such that

[formula]

where B and D are the upper bounds of W and V , respectively. Then {(Ui,υi)}i∈I is also an approximate dual of W. In particular, if W is a Parseval fusion frame and choose V = W, then the result holds for ε < 1.

Notice that {(Ui,υi)}i∈I is a Bessel fusion sequence, in fact

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

where the last inequality is implied from ([\ref=M]). The rest follows by the fact that each Parseval fusion frame is a dual of itself.

Consider

[formula]

[formula]

Then [formula] and [formula]. Hence, the Bessel sequence V  =  {Vi}3i = 1 is an approximate dual of fusion frame W  =  {Wi}3i = 1. Now, if we take

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula], then U  =  {Ui}i∈I is a ε-perturbation of V with [formula]. Hence, by Theorem [\ref=perturbation], U is also an approximate dual of W.

The next result is obtained immediately from Theorem [\ref=perturbation].

Let {(Vi,υi)}i∈I be an alternate dual of a Bessel fusion sequence W  =  {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I. Also let {(Ui,υi))}i∈I be a ε-perturbation of V, and

[formula]

where B is the upper bound of W. Then {(Ui,υi)}i∈I is an approximate dual of W.

Let V  =  {(Vi,υi)}i∈I be an approximate dual of a Bessel fusion sequence W  =  {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I. Also let {Ui}i∈I be a ε-perturbation of W with sufficiently small bound ε > 0, then {(Vi,υi)}i∈I is also an approximate dual of U  =  {(Ui,ωi)}i∈I.

Applying the Cauchy Schwarz inequality for every f∈H we have

[formula]

Thus, the desired result follows by letting

[formula]

where B and D are the upper bounds of W and V , respectively.

Consider

[formula]

Then V  =  {Vi}3i = 1 is a dual of Parseval fusion frame W = {Wi}3i = 1, in which

[formula]

On the other hand, letting

[formula]

Then {Ui}i∈I is a ε-perturbation of W with ε  <  0.02. Using the fact that

[formula]

we obtain V is an approximate dual of {Ui}i∈I by Theorem [\ref=perturbation2].

We know that many concepts of the classical frame theory have not been generalized to the fusion frames. For example, in the duality discussion, if V  =  {(Vi,υi)}i∈I is a dual of fusion frame W  =  {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I, then W is not a dual of V, see Example 2.2 in [\cite=Ar14], moreover, it is not an approximate dual of V in general. Indeed, if

[formula]

and ω1  =  ω3  =  ω4  =  1, [formula]. Then W  =  {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I is a fusion frame for [formula] with an alternate dual as V  =  {(Vi,υi)}i∈I where

[formula]

and υ1  =  υ3  =  3 , [formula], υ4  =  1, see Example 3.1 of [\cite=Amiri]. A straightforward calculation shows that ||IH  -  ψwv||  =  1, hence W is not an approximate dual of V. The next theorem gives a sufficient condition for a fusion frame is approximate dual of its dual.

Let {(Vi,υi)}i∈I be a dual of fusion frame {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I such that

[formula]

Then {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I is an approximate dual of {(Vi,υi)}i∈I.

By the assumption TVφvwT*W  =  IH, where φvw is given by ([\ref=phi]). Also, it is not difficult to see that φ*vw{fi}  =  {πWiS- 1Wfi} for all [formula]. Hence

[formula]

The fusion frame W in Example [\ref=example] is not a dual of V, however, a straightforward calculation shows that

[formula]

Hence, W is an approximate dual of V by Theorem [\ref=dual_._app]. It is worth noticing that, unlike discrete frames, {ψ- 1wvWi}3i = 1 is not dual of {Vi}3i = 1. Indeed ψ- 1wv  =  2IH and so

[formula]

However, it can be considered as a Q-dual of {Vi}3i = 1 with

[formula]

More precisely, let {ej}j∈J be an orthonormal basis for H. By Proposition [\ref=app.wrt.local], we can derive that the sequence G  =  {υiπViej}i∈I,j∈J is an approximate dual of F  =  {ωiπWiS- 1Wej}i∈I,j∈J. Hence (TGT*F)- 1G is a dual of {ωiπWiS- 1Wej}i∈I,j∈J. On the other hand, TGT*F  =  TVφvwT*W  =  ψvw, see the proof of Theorem [\ref=3.8]. Hence {(ψ- 1vwVi,υi)}i∈I is a Q-dual of {(Wi,ωi)}i∈I by Theorem 3.12 in [\cite=Hei14].
