On Drury's solution of Bhatia & Kittaneh's question

Introduction

Bhatia has made many fundamental contributions to Matrix Analysis [\cite=Bha97]. One of his favorite topics is matrix inequalities. Roughly speaking, matrix inequalities are noncommutative versions of the corresponding scalar inequalities. To get a glimpse of this topic, let us start with a simple example. The simplest AM-GM inequality says that

[formula]

Now it is known that [\cite=Bha07] its most "direct" noncommutative version is

[formula]

where [formula] is called the geometric mean of A and B. For two Hermitian matrices A and B of the same size, in this article, we write A  ≥  B (or B  ≤  A) to mean that A - B is positive semidefinite.

If we denote [formula], then B = SA- 1S. Thus a variant of ([\ref=am-gm]) is the following

[formula]

There is a long tradition in matrix analysis of comparing eigenvalues or singular values. To proceed, let us fix some notation. The j-th largest singular value of a complex matrix A is denoted by σj(A). If all the eigenvalues of A are real, then we denote its j-th largest one by λj(A). By Weyl's Monotonicity Theorem [\cite=Bha97], ([\ref=am-gm]) readily implies

[formula]

As far as the eigenvalues or singular values are considered, there are other versions of "geometric mean". Bhatia and Kittaneh studied this kind of inequalities over a twenty year period [\cite=BK90] [\cite=BK00] [\cite=BK08]. Their elegant results include the following: If A,B are n  ×  n positive semidefinite matrices, then

[formula]

for [formula].

To complete the picture in ([\ref=bk1])-([\ref=bk2]), they asked whether it is true

[formula]

This question was recently answered in the affirmative by Drury in his very brilliant work [\cite=Dru12]. The purpose of this expository article is to revisit Drury's solution. Hopefully, some of our arguments would shed new insights into the beautiful result, which is now a theorm.

[\cite=Dru12] If A,B are n  ×  n positive definite semidefinite matrices, then

[formula]

Drury's reduction in proving ([\ref=bkd])

Our presentation here is just slightly different from that in [\cite=Dru12].

Assume without loss of generality that A,B are positive definite (the general case is by a standard purturbation argument). Fix r in the range 1  ≤  r  ≤  n and normalize so that σr(AB) = 1. Our goal is to show that λr(A + B)  ≥  2.

Note that σr(AB) = 1 is the same as λr(AB2A) = 1. Consider the spectral decomposition

[formula]

where [formula], are orthogonal projections. Then λk(AB2A)  ≥  1 for [formula]. Define a positive semidefinite

[formula]

It is easy to see (indeed, from B2  ≥  B21) that

[formula]

So we are done if we can show

[formula]

As B1 has rank r, split the underlying space as the direct sum of image and kernel of B1, we may partition comformally B1 and A in the following form

[formula]

Note AB21A is an orthogonal projection of rank r, the same is true for B1A2B1. Therefore,

[formula]

where Ir is the r  ×  r identity matrix.

Finally, observe that

[formula]

Therefore, ([\ref=reduction1]) would follow from

[formula]

Thus, the remaining effort is made to show ([\ref=reduction2]), which we formulate as a proposition.

Let A11 and X be r  ×  r positive definite matrices and A12 is an (n - r)  ×  (n - r) matrix such that X(A211 + A12A*12)X = Ir. Then

[formula]

The mystified part

In order to prove ([\ref=reduction3]), Drury made the following key observations.

[\cite=Dru12] Let M and N be r  ×  r positive definite matrices. Then

[formula]

[\cite=Dru12] Let L and M be r  ×  r positive definite matrices, and let Z be an r  ×  r matrix such that ML(I + ZZ*)LM = Ir. Then

[formula]

The way that Drury proved ([\ref=reduction4]) is by showing that [formula] and [formula] have the same characteristic polynomial, and so the eigenvalues of R and T coincide. As explained in [\cite=Dru12a], this connection (between R and T) is mystified. Formally, the mystified part also comes from R and T themselves, indeed, T is always positive semidefinite while R is not!

In order to apply Proposition [\ref=p3] to Proposition [\ref=p1], Drury discussed three possible relations between the size n and r. Our proof of Proposition [\ref=p1] in the next section allows us to skip this discussion on the size.

Proof of Proposition [\ref=p1]

The following lemma slightly generalizes Proposition [\ref=p2] in form.

Let X be a r  ×  r positive definite matrix and let S be a r  ×  r nonsingular matrix. Then

[formula]

Consider the polar decomposition of S, S = U|S|, where U is unitary and [formula]. The matrix [formula] is unitarily similar to

[formula]

As [formula] is a partial isometry,

[formula]

The required result follows.

Now we are ready to give a simpler proof of Proposition [\ref=p1].

Proof. Consider the factorization

[formula]

Clearly, [formula] is unitarily similar to

[formula]

Now setting [formula] in Lemma [\ref=lem1] yields the desired result.

A conjecture

A weighted version of ([\ref=bk1]) is known. That is, if A,B are n  ×  n positive semidefinite matrices, then for any t∈[0,1] and [formula]

[formula]

Inequality ([\ref=ando]) is due to Ando [\cite=Ando95]. With [\ref=ando]), it is not hard to present a weighted version of ([\ref=bk2]).

If A,B are n  ×  n positive semidefinite matrices, then for any t∈[0,1] and [formula]

[formula]

By ([\ref=ando]) and the matrix convexity of the square function,

[formula]

We conclude the paper with the following conjecture

If A,B are n  ×  n positive definite semidefinite matrices, then for any t∈[0,1]

[formula]

The present method of proof does not seem to lead to a solution of this conjecture.
