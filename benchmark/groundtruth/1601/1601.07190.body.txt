Resummation of electroweak Sudakov logarithms for real radiation

Introduction

It is well known that perturbative corrections in scattering processes have infrared (IR) sensitivity to soft and collinear emissions. For electroweak corrections involving massive Z and W bosons, the mass of the vector boson regulates the IR divergences, such that the IR sensitivity yields logarithmic dependence on the ratio of the vector boson mass over the partonic center of mass energy

[formula]

Both virtual and real corrections give rise to such logarithmic corrections, and as usual, their effect cancels in fully inclusive observables.

This situation is very similar to the more common situation of gauge theories with massless gauge bosons, such as QCD, for which both virtual and real corrections are IR divergent, and the divergence cancels in the sum that enters in any physical observable. However, there are two main differences: First, both virtual and real contribution are separately finite (albeit with logarithmic dependence on the ratio of the mass of the vector boson to the center of mass energy), such that there is no need to combine them for physical observables. Second, even if the measurement is completely inclusive over the final state, the initial beams of typical colliders are typically not SU(2) singlets, such that one can never perform a fully inclusive measurement. Thus, essentially any measurement has logarithmic sensitivity to the ratio m2V  /  , such that for high enough center of mass energies electroweak corrections become very large.

Much effort has been put into understanding the electroweak logarithms arising from virtual corrections [\cite=Kuhn:1999nn] [\cite=Fadin:1999bq] [\cite=Ciafaloni:1999ub] [\cite=Beccaria:2000jz] [\cite=Hori:2000tm] [\cite=Ciafaloni:2000df] [\cite=Denner:2000jv] [\cite=Denner:2001gw] [\cite=Melles:2001ye] [\cite=Beenakker:2001kf] [\cite=Denner:2003wi] [\cite=Pozzorini:2004rm] [\cite=Feucht:2004rp] [\cite=Jantzen:2005xi] [\cite=Jantzen:2005az] [\cite=Jantzen:2006jv] [\cite=Chiu:2007yn] [\cite=Chiu:2008vv] [\cite=Manohar:2012rs]. A general result for the logarithmic dependence at one-loop has been derived in [\cite=Denner:2000jv] [\cite=Denner:2001gw], and a general method for the resummation of these logarithms has been developed in [\cite=Chiu:2007yn] [\cite=Chiu:2008vv]. This method uses SCET which has been developed in [\cite=Bauer:2001ct] [\cite=Bauer:2000ew] [\cite=Bauer:2000yr] [\cite=Bauer:2001yt]. While real radiation of electroweak gauge bosons typically leads to different experimental signatures, in many cases some amount of real radiation is included in the event samples. For example, in many analyses missing energy is not vetoed, such that radiation of Z bosons which decay to neutrinos are included, and any analysis that is inclusive over the number of jets includes real radiation of hadronically decaying vector bosons.

Logarithmic dependence from real emission, however, has been studied much less. The O(α) correction from real emission can of course easily be included using phase space integrations over tree-level matrix elements, and a study of the effect of such real radiation on many experimental observables was performed in [\cite=Baur:2006sn]. It was found that the real corrections can have a sizable effect, albeit typically not quite as large as the virtual corrections. The effects of real radiation have recently been studied in [\cite=Manohar:2014vxa], however, to our knowledge there has been no resummation of the logarithmic dependence on the vector boson mass arising from real radiation.

In this paper we consider the Drell-Yan cross sections

[formula]

Here [formula] denotes either an electron, positron or a neutrino, and V denotes either a Z or a W boson. For Drell-Yan production at NLO accuracy, the first term in Eq. [\eqref=eq:sigmaDefsFirst] includes the tree-level and the one-loop virtual correction, while the second term denotes the real radiation of a gauge boson. Collectively, we will represent these two cross-section as

[formula]

To calculate this hadronic scattering cross-sections one starts as always by factorizing the short distance partonic scattering from the non-perturbative physics describing the binding of partons into hadrons

[formula]

where fi / p(xi) are the parton distribution functions to find parton i in the proton p with momentum fraction xi, and σ̂ab  →  final(xa,xb) denotes the partonic scattering cross-section. By Lorentz invariance, the dependence of the partonic cross-sections on the momentum fractions xi is only through the product s  =  xaxbS, and not through the rapidity Y  =   ln (xa  /  xb)  /  2. Thus, one can write

[formula]

where the parton luminosity is defined as

[formula]

It is the purpose of this paper to derive simple analytical expressions for the resummation of electroweak Sudakov logaritms at leading logarithmic (LL) accuracy, where the results for the real radiation are new. To achieve this, we combine knowledge of the resummation of the virtual corrections, together with the known IR structure of real radiation from parton showers. This allows us to obtain simple analytical results which we present here. We then use these results to give results for the individual contributions to the hadronic cross-sections [formula] as a function of the center of mass energy s. We reproduce the well known fact that resummation has a large effect on the virtual contribution for [formula] TeV. The resummation of the real corrections changes the fixed order results by more than 10% for [formula] TeV, and this effect grows to about 50% for s  ~  25 TeV.

This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. [\ref=sec:structureOfLogs] we set up some notation and derive general expressions for the cross-sections which highlight the structure of the logarithmic corrections. In Sec. [\ref=sec:FO] we give the (well known) fixed order results of the virtual and real electroweak corrections which are enhanced by two powers of the logarithms LV. In Sec. [\ref=subsec:VirtLL] we give the resummed results for the virtual corrections, keeping only LL accuracy. The main new results of this paper are contained in Sec. [\ref=subsec:RealLL], where we derive give the resummation of the leading logarithmic terms for real corrections. The main results of that section are given in Eqs. [\eqref=eq:RealZFinal] and [\eqref=eq:RealWFinal]. In Sec. [\ref=sec:Results] we provide a numerical analyses of these results, both for the 13 TeV LHC and a 100 TeV pp collider. We finish with Conclusions in Sec. [\ref=sec:Conclusions].

The structure of logarithmic terms in the perturbative expansion

To first order in electroweak perturbation theory the partonic scattering cross-section can be written as

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the Born cross-section, and [formula] the O(α) correction. This first order perturbative correction can be decomposed into a virtual and real contribution, and each of these two terms can be further separated by the flavor of the vector boson in the loop or real final state. This gives

[formula]

Here the first term describes the contribution from one-loop diagrams with V  =  {Z,W±,γ} in the loop, while the second term is given by the real radiation of an electroweak gauge boson V.

The contribution of the photon gives rise to a true IR divergence in both the virtual and real contributions, and these divergences cancel once these terms are added (and once combined with the IR divergences from a photon pdf's), leaving only finite remaining terms. Since we are only interested in the electroweak corrections enhanced by powers of LV, we can neglect the contributions from the photons in both the virtual and real contributions.

Each of the remaining terms on the right hand side of Eq. [\eqref=eq:RealVirtSplit] (those with V  =  {Z,W±}), contains double and single logarithmic terms of the form α  LV and α  L2V. By the KLN theorem [\cite=Kinoshita:1962ur], these logarithmically enhanced terms cancel when we sum over complete gauge multiplets. Thus, the completely inclusive cross-section has no logarithmically enhanced terms (called "finite" below)

[formula]

The sum of the initial state is over a,b∈{u,d}, that of the final state is over [formula], and we sum over the virtual contributions, and well as the real contributions with either a Z or W in the final state. Since the logarithmic enhancement depends on the mass of the vector boson, the logarithmic corrections from Z bosons and W bosons cancel separately between real and virtual corrections. Furthermore, since the emission of a Z boson does not change the flavor of a fermion, the cancellation of the terms enhanced by LZ happens for each flavor assignment separately. This gives

[formula]

The emission of W bosons, on the other hand, changes the flavor of the fermion. This implies that the cancellation of the terms enhance by LW only happens after summing over all flavors

[formula]

An important consequence of Eq. [\eqref=eq:WCancellation] is that a finite answer is only obtained if one sums over all initial state flavors. Thus, the hadronic cross-section given in Eq. [\eqref=eq:hadronicDY] still contains contributions enhanced logarithmically by factors of LW. This is because each initial state flavor is multiplied by a different parton luminosity, such that the sum over initial state flavors can not be observed. As we will see in Sec. [\ref=sec:Results], however, for inclusive Drell-Yan production at a pp collider these logarithmic corrections are numerically small. This is a consequence of the fact that the parton density of ū and [formula] quarks in a proton are numerically close.

Fixed order calculations of the virtual and real contributions

In this section we consider the fixed order expansion of the virtual corrections [formula] and the real contributions [formula]. For both terms, we quote here only the dominant contributions that are enhanced by two powers of LV.

For completeness, we start with the Born cross-sections, including the contributions from both photon and Z exchange. They are given by

[formula]

where we have defined the constant

[formula]

with NC  =  3 denoting the number of colors. To simplify the notation, we have written our results in terms of the coupling constants of the unbroken theory

[formula]

The virtual corrections from W exchange that are enhanced by two powers of the logarithm are easily obtained and are given by

[formula]

Those from Z exchange are given by

[formula]

where sW  =   sin (θW) and

[formula]

The double-logarithmically enhanced real corrections with a Z boson in the final state are related to the corresponding virtual corrections via

[formula]

For those with a W+ boson in the final state we find

[formula]

while those with a W- are given by

[formula]

From these results one can obtain the inclusive cross-sections, which have been summed over all final state flavors

[formula]

From these expressions one can very easily validate that in [formula] all double logarithms cancel.

LL resummation of the leading logarithms

Virtual corrections

To resum the electroweak Sudakov logarithms for for the virtual contributions we follow the work of [\cite=Chiu:2008vv] [\cite=Chiu:2009mg], which uses renormalization group equations in SCET. The calculation proceeds in three steps. At the scale μ2Q  ~  , one matches the full theory onto 4-fermion operators in SCET, where each of the fermion is represented by a different collinear sector in SCET. One then runs the theory from the scale μQ to the scale μV  ~  mV, at which point the massive gauge bosons are integrated out of the theory and electroweak symmetry is broken. As long as   ≫  m2V, the mass of the vector boson can be set to zero in the matching onto SCET at the scale μQ, and in the calculation of the anomalous dimension which governs the running from μQ to μV. This implies that one can use an unbroken SU(2), simplifying these calculations substantially.

In [\cite=Chiu:2008vv] [\cite=Chiu:2009mg], this resummation was carried out in full generality to NLL[formula] accuracy. For the purposes of this work, we only work to LL accuracy, which simplifies the structure significantly. The first simplification is that only tree level matching is required both at the high and low scale. Furthermore, no operator mixing arises in the running from the high to the low scale. This will allow us to write relatively simple analytical formulae.

As already mentioned, in the effective theory between μQ and μV one can use unbroken electroweak symmetry, such that there are a total of 7 operator that contribute

[formula]

where we have defined the fermion bilinears in either triplet or singlet representation

[formula]

Here Q and L denote left-handed quark and lepton fields, respectively, while U, D and E denote the right handed up-type quarks, down-type quarks and electron fields. The tree level matching is given by

[formula]

where I and F denote the initial and final fermions of each singlet operator, and Yi is the hypercharge of particle i.

In general, the renormalization group can mix these operators, however this mixing only arises starting at NLL. Since we are only interested in LL accuracy we can write

[formula]

The anomalous dimension to this order is given by the cusp anomalous dimension

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here 2i is the SU(2) Casimir of the j'th fermion (3/4 for left-handed fermions and 0 for right-handed fermions) in Oi, and Qj the electric charge.

The solution to this RGE can easily be written down analytically, and one finds for the Wilson coefficients at the low scale

[formula]

Working in the limit αi ln m2V  /    ~  1, one obtains the simple result

[formula]

Note that the anomalous dimension and therefore the evolution Kernel only depends on the type of initial and final state particles. Thus, we have

[formula]

Putting these results together, we obtain the simple results for the resummed virtual corrections

[formula]

Note that since α1  /  α2  =  s2W  ~  0.24, the term proportional to α21 (which depends on various different evolution Kernels) is numerically suppressed compared to the term proportional to (α1  ±  3α2)2. Thus, to a good approximation, each leptonic final state gets the same suppression factor UQL from the resummation.

A simple check of our results is that they reproduce the Born results given in Eq. [\eqref=eq:Born] if we set all resummation Kernels to unity, and that they reproduce the fixed order results inEqs. [\eqref=eq:FOVirtW] and [\eqref=eq:FOVirtZ] if we use the expansion [formula].

Real corrections

In this section we will show how one can calculate the resummation of the real emissions using the results of the previous subsection. To do this, we will start by rewriting the results obtained in Sec. [\ref=subsec:VirtLL] in a slightly different form, separating the contributions to Eq. [\eqref=eq:virtualResummed] from the different helicities

[formula]

where at the double logarithmic level the factor Δ factors into pieces for each fermion

[formula]

The superscript H denotes that each fermion has a fixed helicity. The Born cross-sections are given by

[formula]

where T3qH denotes the weak isospin of the fermion [formula] with helicity H,. The factors [formula] are defined by

[formula]

where

[formula]

Summing Eq. [\eqref=eq:virtualAsShower] over all possible helicity structures, we reproduce Eq. [\eqref=eq:virtualResummed]. For later convenience, we also define

[formula]

By rewriting our result as in Eq. [\eqref=eq:virtualAsShower], one notices that can be interpreted as the exclusive cross-section for the scattering process [formula], where [formula] is a Sudakov factor describing the probability of not having an emission of electroweak gauge bosons with t  >  m2. The factor ΔfH(m2,) describes the no-branching probability off a single fermion f with helicity H. Since of course the emission of a massive gauge boson always gives t  >  m2, this exclusive cross-section is by definition equal to the virtual result.

Eq. [\eqref=eq:virtualAsShower] is precisely the result that a parton shower would predict for the exclusive cross-section, and one can use insight from parton shower evolution to derive the expressions for real gauge boson radiation. It is given in a parton shower through by the product of Altarelli-Parisi splitting functions, which describe the emission at a given value of t, multiplied by a Sudakov factor, which gives the no-branching probability above the value of t as explained in [\cite=Sjostrand:2006za]. Following this logic, the probability of emitting a gauge boson at virtuality t can be written as the derivative of the Sudakov factor

[formula]

The above probability P(t) describes the probability of emitting any gauge boson, but we of course want to separately describe the emission of W and Z bosons. This can be achieved, by rewriting the factor AFH in terms of a Z and W contribution. To accomplish that, we rewrite the combination of group theory invariants appearing in Eq. [\eqref=eq:AfHdef] as

[formula]

where we have defined

[formula]

This allows to write

[formula]

where

[formula]

Thus, the term AfH can be decomposed into a contribution from Z and one from W bosons. Since the Sudakov factor depends exponentially on AfH one can write it as a product of the two Sudakov factors

[formula]

with

[formula]

as long as one is neglecting the mass difference between the W and Z boson. The whole Sudakov factor is then given by

[formula]

where [formula] is defined through the equivalent of Eq. [\eqref=eq:DeltaCombineDef].

Thus, probability for the emission of a Z with virtuality t boson off a fermion fH is given by

[formula]

while the probability of an emission of a W boson is given by

[formula]

This gives finally the probability of radiating a Z or W boson off one of the operators describing the [formula] scattering to be

[formula]

The resummed real contributions is the integral of the probability of emitting a gauge boson over all virtuality times the Born cross-section. For the radiation of a Z boson, which does not change the flavor structure of the fermions involved, we use

[formula]

Integrating this over m2Z  <  t  <  , we obtain the total probability to radiate a Z boson from a given operator. This gives

[formula]

where we have defined

[formula]

This total probability multiplies the Born cross-section to make the cross-section of real emission. This gives

[formula]

For later convenience, we define

[formula]

such that we can write

[formula]

This is one of the main results in this paper.

Eq. [\eqref=eq:RealZFinal] can easily be expanded, by noting that

[formula]

This gives

[formula]

which after summation over helicities reproduces the result of Eq. [\eqref=eq:FORealZ].

To derive the result for the radiation of W bosons, one needs to take into account that the W emission changes the flavor of the emitting fermions. Besides this complication, the results are derived in the same way as for Z boson radiation. As in Eq. [\eqref=eq:TotalProbabilityRealZ], the total probability to radiate a W boson from a given operator is

[formula]

Thus, the probability to radiate a W boson from the fermion f is

[formula]

Each of these probabilities contribute to the cross-section for which the flavor of the radiating fermion changes. Thus, one finds

[formula]

Expanding these results using Eqs. [\eqref=eq:SigmaBDef] and [\eqref=eq:RExpand] we recover the fixed order results given in Eqs. [\eqref=eq:RealWp] and [\eqref=eq:RealWm].

Results

In this section we analyze the results presented in the last two sections for both the the 13 TeV LHC and a 100 TeV proton-proton collider. The main reason to present the results for a 100 TeV collider is that it is the main candidate to succeed to the LHC and the importance of our results increase with the energy. Our results show that resumming both the real and virtual logarithms is essential for a 100 TeV collider.

We begin by explaining the format used in all of our plots: solid lines represent the resummed LL corrections, while dashed lines are the fixed order double logarithmic correction. Black lines correspond to the virtual corrections while the real corrections with Z,W+ and W- are shown in red, blue and green, respectively. For each plot, we show on the top the perturbative corrections relative to the Born, in the middle the relative size of the resummation and on the bottom the total perturbative correction after summing virtual and real relative to the Born. To be more precise, on the top we plot for virtual and real

[formula]

using either the resummed or fixed order expression. In the middle we show for the virtual contribution

[formula]

while for the lower plot we show

[formula]

for both fixed order and resummed. All effects are shown as a percentage.

We start with the result for the fully inclusive cross-section, where we sum over the flavors of all final state particles. In other words, we are summing over the virtual corrections for any lepton flavor, and the real corrections for any lepton flavor and gauge boson type. In terms of equations, for the fixed order result we are summing over all terms in Eqs. [\eqref=eq:FOVirtW] and [\eqref=eq:FOVirtZ] and all terms in Eqs. ([\ref=eq:FORealZ]) - ([\ref=eq:RealWm]). For the resummed result, we are adding all terms in Eq. [\eqref=eq:virtualResummed] together with all terms in Eqs. [\eqref=eq:RealZFinal] and [\eqref=eq:RealWFinal].

For this fully inclusive cross section the logarithmically enhanced virtual and real corrections should cancel against each other, up to the fact that the pp initial state is not an iso-singlet. The results for the virtual and real contributions both at fixed and resummed order are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:Inclusive13] for the LHC and in Fig. [\ref=fig:Inclusive100] for the 100 TeV collider. For the LHC, the corrections from virtual contributions range from O(15%) at s  ~  1 TeV to O(30%) at s  ~  3 TeV, while the real corrections for a given gauge boson are about a factor of 3 smaller individually. However, as can be seen from the ratio plot in the middle, the relative effect of the resummation is the same for the virtual and all real corrections, and reaches from ~  8% at s  ~  1 TeV to ~  18% at s  ~  3 TeV. This clearly shows that the size of the resummation effect can not be inferred from the size of the fixed order correction alone.

In the lower part of the plot, one can see that after summing the virtual and real, the perturbative corrections largely cancel, but a small effect at the 1% level persists. The remaining effect is of course due to the initial state not being an SU(2) singlet. The large cancellation can be understood from Eq. [\eqref=eq:InclusivePartonic], which shows that switching the flavor of initial state anti-quark changes the sign of the partonic cross-section. Since pdf's for sea quarks are similar in magnitude, one expects fū  /  p  ~  f  /  p, explaining the cancellation.

For the 100 TeV collider, the results are qualitatively the same, but given the much larger reach in energy, the overall size of the effects are much larger. The virtual contributions range from O(30%) at s  ~  5 TeV to > 50% at s  ~  25 TeV, with the real corrections again roughly a factor of 3 smaller. The relative size of the resummation, is also much larger, and at s  ~  25 TeV changes the result by 50%, for both virtual and real corrections. Thus, at such large energies, resummation has to be included to get a reliable estimate of the effects, not only for virtual corrections but also for the real emissions. Once the virtual and real corrections are added, the total corrections again are very small, at the percent level.

Next, we consider the results for final states with specific leptons flavors. From the Figures [\ref=fig:ee] to [\ref=fig:nue], one can see that at the LHC, the virtual corrections range from O(15%) at s  ~  1 TeV to O(30%) at s  ~  3 TeV, with the exact numbers depending on the leptonic final state chosen, while at a 100 TeV collider they can exceed 50% at s  ~  25 TeV. Resummation at the LHC changes the virtual corrections by O(5%) at s  ~  1 TeV to O(15%) at s  ~  3 TeV, while at a 100 TeV collider the effect can become as large as 50%. After summing over virtual and real corrections, the remaining perturbative corrections grow with energy are much larger than in the fully inclusive case. This is of course expected, since by specifying the leptonic final state, we are not considering an inclusive final state any longer.

Conclusions

In this paper, we considered Drell-Yan production of leptons at a hadron collider, and presented result for the logarithmic resummation at LL accuracy for electroweak corrections to the total cross-section in simple analytic form. While the results from virtual corrections have been known for a long time, our results for the resummation of real radiation are new.

Using these analytical results, we have analyzed the size of the corrections numerically for the 13 TeV LHC and a possible future 100 TeV pp collider. Our results show than the real resummation is as important as the virtual resummation and its importance increases fast with the partonic center of mass energy: at the LHC, the resummation effect over the fixed order goes from around 5% at 1 TeV to around 15% at 3 TeV for the virtual, all kinds of real emissions and any leptonic final state. The resummed virtual over the Born cross-section goes from around 10% at 1 TeV to 30% at 3 TeV, while each resummed reals are around the third of the resummed virtual. At a future 100 TeV pp collider, the resummation effects over the fixed order can be much larger, and are around 50% at 25 TeV in most cases. The resummed virtual over the Born cross-section is around 80% at 25 TeV. Each resummed reals are still around the third of the resummed virtual.

For final states with fixed lepton flavors, summing the virtual and real corrections does not reduce the magnitude of the double logarithmic terms, as expected for a result that is not inclusive. After summing over all lepton flavors, a large cancellation is observed, but a small logarithmic sensitivity remains, due to the fact that protons are not SU(2) singlets.

In this paper, we have only considered the resummation of the real corrections to the total cross-section, and not given results that are differential in the emitted vector boson. That implies that we were only able to present results that were differential in [formula], and not [formula], since these differ for real emissions. However, one can use the same approach used in this work, namely using the analogy to a parton shower, to obtain results that are fully differential. This will be the subject of a future paper.
