Low-energy neutrinos

Introduction

Neutrinos interact with matter only through the weak interactions and thus, their probability to interact is small. As a consequence, neutrino detectors have to be placed in underground laboratories in which overburden rocks shield against cosmic radiations. This is the case of three experiments results of which are discussed here: Borexino at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy and SuperKamiokande and KamLAND in the Kamioka mine in Japan.

In liquid scintillator detectors, as Borexino (280 ton) and KamLAND (1 kton), neutrinos are detected via the elastic scattering off electrons. Since it is not possible to distinguish the signals of such electrons from the signals due to natural radioactivity, the whole experimental setup has to be constructed from materials of very low radioactivity. Borexino, having the detection of solar neutrinos as its primary goal, has reached unprecedentedly high levels of radio-purity. Liquid scintillators provide high light yield and thus, a possibility to lower the detection threshold to sub-MeV energy region. Borexino was the first experiment to perform spectroscopic measurements of all neutrino species (pp, 7Be, pep, 8B) emitted in the pp-cycle, the chain of interactions powering the Sun by fusion of protons into 4He. On the other hand, the water Cherenkov detectors, as SuperKamiokande, are able to detected only higher energy neutrinos of few MeV. The possibility of directionality measurement gives an opportunity to improve the signal-to-background ratio in these detectors, by selecting only the events coming from the direction of the actual Sun's position. Thanks to its huge volume of 50 kton, SuperKamiokande is successfully collecting a large sample of 8B solar neutrinos.

Electron antineutrinos, as it is the case of geoneutrinos, are detected by the inverse-beta decay (IBD) reaction

[formula]

Liquid scintillators are used as proton-rich targets. Only antineutrinos with energies above 1.8 MeV, the kinematic threshold of this interaction, can be detected. Reactor neutrinos, also electron flavor antineutrinos, are detected by the very same process. For an experiment constructed close to a nuclear reactor, as for example KamLAND, these represent an irreducible background in geoneutrino measurements. The IBD interaction provides, however, a powerful tool to suppress other types of background, thanks to a possibility to require a space and time coincidence between the prompt signal and the delayed one. The positron comes to rest very fast and then annihilates emitting two 511 keV γ-rays, yielding a prompt event. The visible energy Eprompt is directly correlated with the incident antineutrino energy Ee:

[formula]

The neutron, produced in IBD reaction together with prositron, keeps initially the information about the incident e direction. Unfortunately, it is typically captured on protons only after a long thermalization time with τ = 200 - 250 μs (depending on scintillator), during which this information is mostly lost. When the thermalized neutron is captured on proton, a 2.22 MeV de-excitation γ-ray is emitted, providing a coincident delayed event.

After this short introduction to the experimental techniques of low-energy neutrino physics, the following three sections are dedicated to solar neutrinos, geoneutrinos, and neutrinos from artificial radioactive sources, respectively. Each of them describes the present-day motivation of each particular field, its open questions, as well as the latest experimental results and future perspectives.

Solar neutrinos

The Sun is powered by nuclear fusion reactions in which protons are forming 4He nuclei. The principal chain of reactions of this process is called the pp-cycle. Figure [\ref=Fig:solar_spectrum] shows the energy spectrum of neutrinos emitted in some of these reactions. The so called pp neutrinos represent the dominant component with continuous energy spectrum up to 420 keV. There are 3 mono-energetic lines, the main 7Be line at 862 keV and the one at 384 keV, with the intensity ~  10-times lower, and the low-intensity pep neutrino line at 1440 keV. Only the liquid scintillator experiments are able to perform the spectroscopy of these species of solar neutrinos. The water Cherenkov based detectors are instead able to measure only the higher energy part of 8B neutrinos, extending up to ~  15 MeV and having a very low flux. It is believed that a small fraction of solar energy is produced in the fusion process catalyzed by the presence of heavier elements, in the so called CNO cycle, which should be the dominant fusion process in heavy stars. The CNO-neutrinos, shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig:solar_spectrum] by the dashed blue lines labeled 13N, 15O, and 17F, have never been observed yet.

The measurement of solar neutrinos brought a real breakthrough in particle physics through the observation of neutrino oscillations [\cite=SNOOscill], proving that neutrinos have non-zero mass. This discovery made in 2002 was awarded the Nobel prize now in 2015. And even today, the field of solar neutrinos continues to be a thrilling research area giving us a possibility of new discoveries.

Solar neutrinos can help us to understand the Sun itself. The so called Standard Solar Models (SSM) have among other inputs (luminosity, mass, radius, opacity etc.) also the so called metallicity, the ratio of abundances of elements heavier than He (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, Ar, Fe) to that of hydrogen. Among SSM outputs are the neutrino fluxes (as in Fig. [\ref=Fig:solar_spectrum]) and the sound-waves speed profiles (helioseismology). The hot topic in solar neutrino physics today is the so called metallicity problem: the new 3D SSM [\cite=highZ] using new spectroscopic measurements with high metallicity do spoil the perfect agreement between the helioseismological data and the predictions of the old 1D SSM [\cite=lowZ] using in input the older spectroscopic data with low metallicity. Since the low- and high-metallicity SSM predict different fluxes of neutrinos (difference of 8.8, 17.7, and 30-40% for 7Be, 8B, and CNO neutrino fluxes, respectively), the precise measurements of solar neutrino fluxes can significantly help in solving this puzzle. Unfortunately, the existing measurements of 7Be and 8B fluxes fall in between the predictions of the high- and low-metallicity SSM, being compatible with both of them (see Fig. 82 in [\cite=BXLong]).

Neutrinos are in fact the only direct evidence of the ongoing fusion interactions in the Sun's core. By comparing the neutrino luminosity with the optical one, one can test how well do we understand these mechanisms powering our star. It takes at the order of 105 years before the photon produced in the Sun's core can reach the Earth, while the only-weakly-interacting neutrino can immediately escape the Sun and reach us in few minutes. Thus, by comparing the optical and neutrino luminosities, one can study also the Sun's stability at the time scale of 105 years. In this sense, the spectral observation of pp neutrinos by Borexino [\cite=Borexinopp], shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig:Borexinopp], was ranked by Physics World among the Top 10 Physics Breakthroughs of 2014.

Solar neutrino studies can also contribute to our understanding of the nature of neutrino interactions. The electron-neutrino survival probability Pee as a function of energy, as predicted by the LMA-MSW solution of neutrino oscillations [\cite=MSW], is demonstrated by the curve in Fig. [\ref=Fig:BorexinoPee]. The matter resonance effect, important especially in the dense solar core, decreases the electron-neutrino survival probability at energies above cca 5 MeV (only 8B solar neutrinos). The data points for pp, 7Be, pep, and 8B neutrinos measured by Borexino and shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig:BorexinoPee] are pinning down the predicted theoretical curve. However, the large volume Cherenkov detectors, as SuperKamiokande, are better suited to further test the so called transition region where the survival probability curve changes from the vacuum- to matter-dominated region [\cite=SuperK_paralel] [\cite=SuperKSolar]. This is particularly important in a view of the fact that some new physics could influence the exact shape of this transition region, as for example the Non-Standard neutrino Interactions (NSI) [\cite=NSI] or the existence of an ultra-light sterile neutrino [\cite=LightNu].

The matter resonance effect can cause also the regeneration of the electron flavor as solar neutrinos cross the Earth during the night. MSW-LMA predicts this effect to be energy dependent. In accordance, Borexino has excluded this night regeneration for 7Be neutrinos with about 1% precision [\cite=BorexinoDN]. However, for higher energies of 8B neutrinos, SuperKamiokande succeeded to provide the first direct indication at 3σ confidence level of such matter enhanced oscillations [\cite=SuperKDN], as demonstrated in Fig. [\ref=Fig:SuperKDN].

Global fits of all solar neutrino data result in the extraction of neutrino oscillation parameters, being most sensitive to sin 2θ12 and Δm212. Figure [\ref=Fig:OscilPar] demonstrates the latest update provided by SuperKamiokande [\cite=SuperK_paralel] for sin 2θ12 and Δm212 parameter space. A 2σ confidence level tension is observed for the Δm212 value obtained from solar neutrino data and that coming from KamLAND measurements with reactor antineutrinos [\cite=Kamland].

Borexino is currently running in the so called Phase II, after an extensive purification campaign. More precise measurements of the 7Be, pep and may be also pp neutrino fluxes can be expected in near future. A strong effort is invested also towards a possible observation of CNO neutrinos, an extremely difficult task due to the spectral degeneracy with 210Bi. SuperKamiokande continues to take data and to further test the Pee transition region. Other future large volume liquid scintillator detectors (1 kton SNO+ in Canada should start soon and 20 kton JUNO in China has its start planned for 2020) have solar neutrinos among their additional scientific goals.

Geoneutrinos

Geoneutrinos are electron-flavor antineutrinos emitted in the β decays of long-lived radioactive elements, called also the heat producing elements (HPE). As shown in schematic reactions in Fig. [\ref=Fig:Geo], geoneutrinos are emitted along the decay chains of 238U and 232Th and in the 40K decay. The main aim of geoneutrino studies is to determine the Earth's radiogenic heat, especially the unknown contribution from the mantle. The mantle composition is quite unknown with respect to the better-known crustal composition. Knowing the mass/abundances of HPE, the radiogenic heat is directly determined. The geoneutrino studies are, however, complicated through an unknown distribution of HPE, on which depends both the geoneutrino signal prediction as well as the final interpretation of the measured geoneutrino flux, see Fig. [\ref=Fig:Geo].

Geoneutrino spectrum is shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig:GeoSpectrum]. Due to the 1.8 MeV kinematic threshold of the IBD reaction (Eq. [\ref=Eq:InvBeta]), only the high-energy tail of 238U and 232Th geoneutrinos can be detected, while all 40K geoneutrinos are below the threshold.

Uranium and Thorium are so called refractory litophile elements. This means, that i) they do bound to silicates and not to metals (so they are not expected to be present in the Earth's metallic core) and ii) in the process of partial melting of the heterogeneous system as are the rocks, they do concentrate in partial melt which is typically lighter than the HPE-depleted solid residuum. The latter characteristics means that the HPE are strongly concentrated in the continental crust which has the most complex geological history. The oceanic crust is enriched in HPE with respect to the mantle, from which it is differentiated along mid-ocean ridges. Typically, for the experimental sites built at the continental crust, about half of the total geoneutrino signal comes from the continental crust in the area of few hundreds of kilometers around the detector [\cite=Huang]. Thus, for these experiments, in order to extract the mantle contribution from the measured geoneutrinos signal, it is necessary to be able to subtract the crustal contribution. This means, that the local geology in the area of the experiment has to be known.

Geoneutrinos represent a completely new technique how to get information about the deep Earth. Seismology, by studying the propagation of the S and P waves, can reconstruct the velocity and the density profiles of the Earth, but does not provide any direct information about the chemical composition. This in turn is the topic of study for geochemistry. Direct rock samples are available only from limited depths and for the deep Earth we have to rely on geochemical modeling. This uses the correlations observed between the compositions of meteorites and solar photosphere [\cite=GeoRev], which are then extrapolated also for the Earth. The bulk composition of the silicate Earth, the so called Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) models (for their overview see [\cite=Sramek]), describe the composition of the Primitive Mantle, after the core separation and before the crust-mantle differentiation. Geodynamical BSE models, considering the mantle convection, require in general higher abundances of HPE in the mantle with respect to geo- and cosmo-chemical BSE models. Information about the integral surface heat flux of 47 ±   2 TW [\cite=Davis] is derived from the temperature gradients measured along the bore-holes.

Today, only two experiments succeeded to measure geoneutrinos: KamLAND in Japan and Borexino in Italy. The latest KamLAND result, 116+ 28- 27 geoneutrinos detected with 4.9  ×  1032 target-proton ×   year exposure, is from 2013 [\cite=GeoKL], including the period of low reactor antineutrino background after the April 2011 Fukushima disaster.

Borexino provided a new update in 2015 [\cite=GeoBx2015], as demonstrated in Fig. [\ref=Fig:GeoBx]. Within the exposure of (5.5  ±  0.3)  ×  1031 target-proton ×   year, 23.7+ 6.5- 5.7+ 0.9- 0.6 geoneutrino events have been detected. The null observation of geoneutrinos has a probability of 3.6  ×  10- 9 (5.9σ). A geoneutrino signal from the mantle is obtained at 98% confidence level. The radiogenic heat production for U and Th from the present best-fit result is restricted to the range 23 to 36 TW, taking into account the uncertainty on the distribution of HPE inside the Earth.

In the near future, a possible update could be expected from KamLAND, possibly after the refurbishing of the outer detector planned for 2016. Borexino geoneutrino data-set will naturally end with the start of the SOX project (see below) at the end of 2016. Future experiments SNO+ and JUNO have geoneutrinos among their scientific goals. A real breakthrough would come with the proposed Hanohano [\cite=hanohano] project in Hawaii. Placed underwater on a thin, HPE depleted oceanic crust, the mantle contribution to the total geoneutrino flux would be dominant.

Neutrinos from artificial radioactive sources

The measurement of decays of Z0 boson at LEP has confirmed that there are 3 families of light neutrinos interacting through weak interactions. In recent years, however, several experimental results indicate that the 3-flavor picture might not be complete: deficit observed in reactor antineutrino short-baseline experiments, the so called reactor anomaly [\cite=reactorAnomaly], the deficit observed in calibration of Gallex and SAGE experiments with neutrino sources [\cite=CalibAnomaly], the famous appearance of [formula] in [formula] beam seen by LSND [\cite=LSND] and further tested by MiniBooNe [\cite=MiniBooNE]. All these anomalies could be at least partially accommodated if there would exist at least one sterile neutrino. It is called sterile because it would not interact through the forces described by the Standard Model. A global analysis of short-baseline neutrino oscillation data [\cite=Giunti] in 3+1 parameter space leads to Δm241 between 0.82 and 2.19 eV2 at 3σ. In order to probe this region with MeV (anti)neutrinos, the oscillation experiments at distances of few meters have to performed. A possible realization of such measurements is to place a very strong (anti)neutrino source just next to a large volume neutrino detector. In such an experiment, the hypothetical existence of sterile neutrino could be observed not only through an absolute disappearance but also through the oscillation pattern in (L, E) parameter space deviating from the standard 3-flavor scenario. Such an observation would be a “smoking gun” prove that the cause of the deficit is the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation into a new sterile flavor.

There are several candidate projects around the world. However, the only project which has a planned start of the data acquisition in 2016 is Short-distance neutrino Oscillation with BoreXino (SOX) in Italy [\cite=SOX]. A 3.7 PBq (100 kCi) 144Ce-144Pr antineutrino source, producing about 1015 [formula] s, will be placed below the Borexino detector at the end of 2016. The source distance from the detector center will be 8.3 m. The employment of such a strong source is both a technical and a bureaucratic challenge. 144Ce with 285 day lifetime decays to 144Pr which then with much shorter lifetime decays to 144Nd. SOX will measure antineutrinos above the IBD threshold, emitted by 144Pr with the end-point at about 3 MeV. The measurement is complicated by the emission of the 2.2 MeV gammas from the de-excitation of 144Nd. The source will be produced by Mayak in Russia by extracting 144Ce from the fresh nuclear spent fuel.

This measurement is facing several additional complications. The 144Ce-144Pr spectra have to be known with 5% precision, but the situation is complicated since we are dealing with forbidden transitions. The development of new precise spectroscopic measurements is ongoing. The absolute activity of the source will be measured through calorimetric measurement with about 1.5% precision. An extensive calibration campaign of the Borexino detector with AmBe neutron source and other gamma radioactive sources is planned for 2015. The aim is the determination of the detector response function in the whole scintillator volume with 1 to 2% precision. The expected preliminary sensitivity to sterile neutrino parameters Δm241 and sin 2(2θ14) is shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig:SOX].
