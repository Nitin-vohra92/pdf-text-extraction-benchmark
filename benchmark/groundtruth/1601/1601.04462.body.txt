Introduction

In high energy hadronic or nuclear collisions, hard (large momentum transfer Q2) scattered partons (quarks and gluons) fragment and hadronize, resulting in a collimated shower of particles known as a jet [\cite=refJetDef]. Jet measurements in pp collisions provide a test of perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of jet production and fragmentation as implemented in the MC models, and form a baseline for similar measurements in nucleus-nucleus (A-A) and proton-nucleus (p-A) collisions. In A-A collisions an energetic parton while passing through the produced medium loses energy via induced gluon radiation and elastic scattering. Jet studies in A-A collisions in comparison to pp allow a better understanding of the medium induced modifications in the fragmentation of hard scattered partons and energy loss mechanisms [\cite=refJetQuenching1] [\cite=refJetQuenching2], whereas similar studies in p-A collisions potentially reveal the effects of (cold) nuclear matter (CNM). In this paper we present results of jet measurements obtained using ALICE detector in pp collisions at [formula] = 2.76, 7 TeV, in p-Pb collisions at [formula] = 5.02 TeV and in Pb-Pb collisions at [formula] = 2.76 TeV.

Data sample, event selection, track selection, and jet reconstruction

The data used in this analysis were collected during the LHC run in 2010 for pp collisions at 7 TeV, in 2011 for pp collisions at 2.76 TeV, in fall of 2010 for Pb-Pb collisions, and in the beginning of 2013 for p-Pb collisions using the ALICE detector [\cite=refAliceExpt1] [\cite=refAliceExpt2]. Minimum bias events are selected based on information from Silicon Pixel Detector (SPD) [\cite=refSPD] and V0 [\cite=refV0] detectors (V0A, V0C) [\cite=refFullJetPP] [\cite=refChJetPP] [\cite=refChJetPPb] [\cite=refChJetPbPb]. The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal) [\cite=refEmcal] is used in addition to select EMCal triggered events [\cite=refFullJetPP]. Information from the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) [\cite=refTPC] and Inner Tracking System (ITS) [\cite=refSPD] are used to select charged tracks using a hybrid approach as discussed in [\cite=refFullJetPP]. The reconstruction of neutral particles is performed using the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal) [\cite=refFullJetPP]. Charged tracks with transverse momentum ptrackT  ~    >   0.15 GeV/c at midrapidity (|Î·track|  ~    <   0.9) are used as input to jet reconstruction. In addition, for jets including neutral particles, EMCal clusters with energy greater than 0.3 GeV/c are considered. Jets are reconstructed using the infrared collinear safe sequential recombination algorithm anti-kT [\cite=refAntiKt]. In p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions, the kT [\cite=refKt1] [\cite=refKt2] algorithm is used for the estimation of background. Jets are reconstructed with several values of the resolution parameter R in the range 0.2 - 0.6. Jets reconstructed using charged particles only as input are referred to as 'charged jets' whereas jets reconstructed using both charged and neutral particles as input are known as 'full jets' hereafter.

Correction for detector effects and background

Measured distributions are corrected for the instrumental effects and presented at particle level. Corrections for the instrumental effects, such as limited track reconstruction efficiency and finite momentum resolution, are performed using the unfolding techniques [\cite=refBayesianUnf] [\cite=refSVDUnf] for jet cross sections whereas jet shape and fragmentation observables are corrected using a bin-by-bin technique. A full detector simulation is performed using the PYTHIA 6.425 [\cite=refPythia6] event generator and GEANT3 [\cite=refGeant3] particle transport package. All observables are also corrected for the contamination from the secondary particles  and background . The method for estimation and correction of background is however different in pp to that in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions (see [\cite=refFullJetPP] [\cite=refChJetPP] [\cite=refChJetPPb] [\cite=refChJetPbPb] for details). In case of p-Pb and Pb-Pb events, region to region fluctuations of the estimated average background density arising due to fluctuations in the particle multiplicity and momentum, elliptic flow etc., are considerable. Background fluctuations are corrected for on an statistical basis using unfolding techniques (see Sec. 2 of [\cite=refChJetPbPb]). The corrected results are compared to that obtained from various MC event generators e.g. PYTHIA (tune Perugia-0, Perugia-2011, AMBT1), HERWIG, PHOJET and NLO pQCD calculations.

Results

Jet measurements in pp collisions

The full jet production cross sections as a function of jet pT compared to NLO pQCD calculations [\cite=refNLOpQCD] are shown in Fig. [\ref=FigXsecFull] [\cite=refFullJetPP] for pp collisions at [formula] = 2.76 TeV for jets reconstructed with R = 0.2 (left) and 0.4 (right). The NLO calculations reproduce the full jet cross sections reasonably well when hadronization effects are included. The charged jet cross sections compared to MC predictions, are shown in Fig. [\ref=FigXsecCharged] for pp collisions at [formula] = 7 TeV for R = 0.2 (left), 0.4 (middle) and 0.6 (right). None of the models can explain the data in the entire pT range, the discrepancy being larger for larger R. The jet shape observables as defined by the radial transverse momentum density distributions about the jet axis as a function of distance 'r', jet constituents multiplicity and average radius containing 80% of jet pT as a function of leading jet pT, and the fragmentation distributions are, however, in general reasonably well reproduced by these models (figures not shown, see [\cite=refChJetPP]).

Results from p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions

The jet nuclear modification factor RpPb  is shown in Fig. [\ref=FigRpPb] for p-Pb collisions at [formula] = 5.02 TeV for charged jets reconstructed with R = 0.2 (left) and 0.4 (right). It is found to be consistent with unity in the measured pT range indicating the absence of large modifications of the initial parton distribution or strong final state effects on jet production. The charged jet nuclear modification factor, RCP  is shown in Fig. [\ref=FigRaa] as a function of jet pT for three centrality bins for Pb-Pb collisions at [formula] = 2.76 TeV. A large jet suppression is observed in most central (0-10%) Pb-Pb collisions indicating the formation of a dense medium in such collisions. It is found to be centrality and pT dependent. The left (right) panel of Fig. [\ref=FigXsecRatios] shows ratios of spectra (cross sections) for jets measured with R = 0.2 and 0.4 (0.2 and 0.3) in p-Pb (Pb-Pb) collisions at [formula] = 5.02 TeV (2.76 TeV) compared to that obtained in pp collisions (PYTHIA). The ratio of jet spectra is sensitive to the collimation of particles around the jet axis and serves as an indirect measure of jet structure. In minimum bias p-Pb collisions the ratio of jet spectra is found to be compatible with that in pp collisions, PYTHIA and NLO pQCD calculations, and the cross section ratios in Pb-Pb is found to be similar for most central and peripheral collisions and compatible with PYTHIA indicating that the core of the jet within the measured R, remains unmodified in minimum bias p-Pb, peripheral Pb-Pb and even in most central Pb-Pb collisions.

Summary and conclusions

We reported jet measurements for pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at various centre-of-mass energies using the ALICE detector. Jets are measured at midrapidity using the anti-kT jet finding algorithm with several values of the jet resolution parameter (R in the range 0.2 to 0.6). Full jet cross sections are well reproduced by NLO pQCD calculations in pp collisions at [formula] = 2.76 TeV. None of the MC models under study can explain the charged jet cross sections in pp collisions at [formula] = 7 TeV, however jet shape observables and fragmentation distributions are rather well reproduced by these models. The jet nuclear modification factor for minimum bias p-Pb collisions is found to be consistent with unity whereas a large jet suppression is observed for central Pb-Pb events with respect to peripheral events indicating the presence of a dense medium in these collisions. The jet spectra (or cross section) ratios indicate that the core of the jet remains unmodified even in the most central Pb-Pb collisions.
