Estimates for higher Steklov eigenvalues

Introduction

Let u be a smooth function on the boundary ∂M of a compact orientable Riemannian manifold (Mn,g) with nonempty boundary and û be its harmonic extension on M. Then, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map or Steklov operator maps u to [formula] where ν is the outward unit normal vector on ∂M. The spectrum of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map is discrete (See [\cite=Ta]). They are called Steklov eigenvalues of (M,g). The Steklov eigenvalues have been extensively studied. For example [\cite=Br] [\cite=GP1] [\cite=GP2] [\cite=GP3] [\cite=HPS] [\cite=WX] [\cite=W] [\cite=FS1] [\cite=FS2] [\cite=CEG] [\cite=E] obtained interesting estimates for them. [\cite=GP] makes an excellent survey for recent progresses of Steklov eigenvalues.

Recently, Raulot and Savo [\cite=RS2] extended the notion of Steklov eigenvalues to differential forms. Let ω be a differential p-form on ∂M. Let [formula] be the tangential harmonic extension of ω. That is to say, [formula] satisfies:

[formula]

Here ι:∂M  →  M is the natural inclusion. Then, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for p-forms defined by Raulot-Savo [\cite=RS2] maps ω to iνd. It is clear that, when p = 0, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map defined by Raulot and Savo coincides with the classical Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for functions. It was shown in [\cite=RS2] that the spectrum of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map is also discrete. We can arrange them in ascending order(counting multiplicity) as:

[formula]

They are called Steklov eigenvalues for p-forms.

In [\cite=RS1] [\cite=RS2] [\cite=RS3], Raulot and Savo obtained the following interesting upper bounds for Steklov eigenvalues.

Let (Mn,g) be a compact orientable manifold with nonempty boundary. Then,

[formula]

Let Ω be a bounded domain with smooth boundary in [formula]. Then

[formula]

The equality holds if and only if Ω is a ball;

When [formula],

[formula]

When [formula],

[formula]

The equality holds if and only if Ω is ball.

Other interesting estimates of Steklov eigenvalues for differential forms are also obtained in [\cite=K]. The estimate (a) is also obtain in [\cite=IM] by a different method.

In this paper,motivated by the work of Raulot and Savo, we obtain the follow general estimate for Steklov eigenvalues.

Let (Mn,g) be a compact orientable Riemannian manifold with nonempty boundary. Let V be the space of parallel exact 1-forms on M. Suppose that m =  dim V > 0. Then

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula]. Here [formula] and bk denotes the k-th Betti number of M.

When M is a domain in [formula], dim V = n, the theorem above give some generalized estimates with respect to Raulot-Savo's result.

Let Ω be a bounded domain with smooth boundary in [formula]. Then

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula]. Here bp denotes the p-th Betti number of Ω. Moreover, when k = 1 and [formula], the equality of [\eqref=eqn-Omega] holds if and only if Ω is a ball.

In [\cite=RS1], Raulot and Savo also obtained all the Steklov values of the unit ball in [formula]. The first several Steklov eigenvalues are as follows:

[formula];

When [formula],

[formula]

When [formula],

[formula]

From this, we know that the estimate for higher Steklov eigenvalues in [\eqref=eqn-Omega] is not sharp for unit balls. However, when Ω is a strictly convex domain in [formula], we have the following sharp estimate for higher Steklov eigenvalues.

Let Ω be a strictly convex bounded domain in [formula] with smooth boundary. Then,

[formula]

for [formula]. The equality holds for some [formula] if and only if Ω is a ball;

When [formula],

[formula]

for [formula] and

[formula]

for [formula]. The equality holds for some [formula] if and only if Ω is a ball;

When [formula],

[formula]

for [formula]. The equality holds for some [formula] if and only if Ω is a ball.

Here K is the Gaussian curvature of ∂Ω.

The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we prove the general estimate [\eqref=eqn-para]. In section 3, we prove Theorem [\ref=thm-convex].

A general estimate

In this section, we prove Theorem [\ref=thm-para]. The following lemma is the key step to the proof our estimate which is motivated by Raulot-Savo [\cite=RS1].

Let (Mn,g) be a compact orientable Riemannian manifold with nonempty boundary and V be a linear subspace of the space of exact parallel p-forms on M for p  ≥  1. Suppose that dim V = m > 0. Then

[formula]

for [formula]. Here [formula] are the eigenvalues of the linear transformation A on V with

[formula]

for any ξ and η in V.

Let [formula] be the eigenforms of [formula] respectively. It is clear that we can assume that

[formula]

for i  ≠  j. Then

[formula]

when i  ≠  j. Let θi∈Ap - 1(M) be such that

[formula]

By the Hodge decomposition for compact Riemannian manifolds with nonempty boundary (See [\cite=S]), we have

[formula]

where βi∈Ap(M) with iνβi = 0 and γi∈Hp - 1N(M). Here

[formula]

Choose γ̃i∈Hp - 1N(M), such that

[formula]

Then dωi  =  ξi, iνωi = 0 and δωi = 0. Moreover, since ξi is parallel, δξi = 0. So,

[formula]

Let

[formula]

for [formula]. Then dim Ek = k and [formula]. Let [formula] be a complete orthonormal system of eigenforms for positive eigenvalues for the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on Ap - 1(∂M). By dimension reasons, we know that

[formula]

Let [formula] with ω  ≠  0.

Suppose that [formula], then

[formula]

On the other hand, suppose that [formula]. Then

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=eqn-1] and [\eqref=eqn-2], we obtain the conclusion.

The following lemma will be needed to obtain estimates of vk.

Let H be a linear subspace of [formula] of dimension m. Let [formula] be a linear function on [formula]. Then

[formula]

The equality holds if and only if [formula].

Without loss of generality, we can assume that

[formula]

Then,

[formula]

Equality holds only when [formula]. This completes the proof.

By Lemma [\ref=lem-comp], if we can estimate of the eigenvalues vk, then we get estimate for Steklov eigenvalues. So, we come to estimate vk.

Let (Mn,g) be a compact orientable Riemannian manifold with nonempty boundary. Let V be the space of parallel exact 1-forms on M. Suppose that dim V = m > 0. Then,

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula]. Here [formula] is the eigenvalues of the linear transformation A(p) on [formula] with

[formula]

for any [formula].

Let [formula] be the eigenforms for [formula] respectively that are orthogonal to each other. Let [formula] be an orthonormal basis for V. That is to say,

[formula]

Let [formula] be the dual of [formula] respectively. Let [formula] be the space of forms that are orthogonal to [formula], and

[formula]

Then, for any [formula], we have

[formula]

Integrating the last inequality against ξ over [formula], we have

[formula]

where [formula] is the orthogonal projection of ν onto [formula].

Without loss of generality, we can suppose that [formula] with |ν1|  ≤  1. Then

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=lem-int]. Substituting [\eqref=eqn-int-2] into [\eqref=eqn-int-1], we obtain the conclusion.

Now, combining Lemma [\ref=lem-comp] and Lemma [\ref=lem-v], we obtain Theorem [\ref=thm-para]. The inequality [\eqref=eqn-Omega] in Theorem [\ref=thm-Omega] is a direct corollary of Theorem [\ref=thm-para]. The proof of the equality case in Theorem [\ref=thm-Omega] is just the same as the proof the equality case in Theorem 5 of [\cite=RS1].

Eigenvalue estimates on convex domains in [formula]

In this section, we come to prove Theorem [\ref=thm-convex]. The argument is just a simple use of coarea formula to estimate the integral in [\eqref=eqn-int-1].

Since Ω is strictly convex, b0(Ω) = 1 and bp(Ω) = 0 for [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem-comp], we only need to estimate the v(p)k in Lemma [\ref=lem-v] for this case.

Let [formula] be the eigenforms for [formula] respectively that are orthogonal to each other. Let

[formula]

and [formula] be the space of p-forms that are orthogonal to [formula]. Then, for any [formula], we have

[formula]

Integrating the last inequality against ξ over [formula], we have

[formula]

Here we have used the co-area formula and that the Jacobian of the Gauss map is the Gaussian curvature. Note that we have also skew symmetrically extended [formula] in their indices.

When equality of [\eqref=eqn-gauss] is true, we know that [formula] is a constant. This implies that Ω is a ball. Combining this and Raulot-Savo's result [\eqref=eqn-eigen-ball-1] and [\eqref=eqn-eigen-ball-2] give us the conclusion.
