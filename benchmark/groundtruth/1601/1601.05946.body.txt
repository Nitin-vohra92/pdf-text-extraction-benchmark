Introduction

The discovery of a Higgs boson of [formula] [\cite=Chatrchyan:2013mxa] [\cite=Khachatryan:2014ira] [\cite=Aad:2014aba] is consistent with low energy supersymmetry together with a small degree of fine-tuning. However the absence of supersymmetric particles in the [formula] range questions the paradigm of naturalness as a guiding principle. If one abandons the idea of supersymmetry as a solution to the hierarchy problem, reasons remain to study realizations of supersymmetry. In particular, supersymmetry is present in string theory, which is so far the best candidate for a UV-complete theory. Generically, supersymmetric theories in four dimensions obtained from string compactifications favor supersymmetry breaking at high scales, e.g. the GUT scale [\cite=Douglas:2006es]. Furthermore, present data confirmed that the SM Higgs potential becomes metastable at large energy scales[\cite=Buttazzo:2013uya] and supersymmetric embeddings can stabilize the EW vacuum.

Let us consider the situation in which supersymmetry is broken at a scale MSS such that MEW  ≪  MSS. Under no special assumptions on the corresponding pattern of soft terms, supersymmetric particles receive masses of O(MSS) and thus decouple from the low energy theory. The requirement of obtaining a light Higgs in the spectrum leads to a fine-tuning condition at the matching scale MSS and leaves the Standard Model as an effective description at lower energies. However, the corresponding quartic coupling λ(μ) is completely fixed by the matching conditions to the supersymmetric theory at the scale MSS. In turn, the latter implies that the Higgs mass is determined by the supersymmetric theory, and thus, the measured value of the Higgs mass constrains the values of the parameters of the supersymmetric theory and MSS. This framework is called High-Scale Supersymmetry. A detailed study of the Higgs mass in the High-Scale Supersymmetry within the MSSM was done in [\cite=Hall:2009nd] [\cite=Giudice:2011cg] [\cite=Cabrera:2011bi] [\cite=Arbey:2011ab] [\cite=Draper:2013oza] [\cite=Bagnaschi:2014rsa]. In this case the prediction of λ(MSS) is strictly positive (or zero), thus, the scale at which the quartic coupling in the SM vanishes, within uncertainties, sets an upper bound on MSS of [formula]. Hence, a GUT scale SUSY breaking in this setup is ruled out.

In this letter we study High-Scale Supersymmetry within the singlet extension of the MSSM, i.e. Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM), for a comprehensive review see [\cite=Ellwanger:2009dp]. In the NMSSM the couplings of the extra singlet to the Higgs sector induce tree level corrections to the matching of λ at the MSS scale. Two pieces contribute to λ(MSS) that are model independent and model dependent respectively. The former is strictly positive (or zero), and it can significantly modify the parameter values consistent with the Higgs mass w.r.t the MSSM case. On the other hand, the latter contribution allows to set λ(MSS) to a negative value, and thus, can extend MSS up to the GUT or Planck scales. In this work we calculate the prediction for the Higgs mass in this framework and derive the respective bounds on MSS and the NMSSM parameters.

This letter is organized as follows in section [\ref=settingNMSSM] we write down the matching conditions that relate the singlet-extended MSSM framework with the effective SM and discuss the fine-tuning condition required to induce a light Higgs. In section [\ref=calcHiggsmass] we explain how we calculate the Higgs mass and in section [\ref=HiggsvsMss] we study the dependence of the Higgs mass as a function of the SUSY-breaking scale and NMSSM parameters. In section [\ref=UVdependence] we study the constraints on the Higgs mass for special choices of soft parameters at the GUT scale. Finally, in section [\ref=conclusion] we present the conclusions.

Fine-tuning a light Higgs in SUSY and matching to the Standard model

Let us consider a scenario in which above the (not necessarily low) supersymmetry breaking scale (MSS) the theory is described by a singlet-extended MSSM with the following superpotential

[formula]

where S is the NMSSM singlet and Hu,Hd are the MSSM Higgs multiplets. ys is a dimensionless Yukawa coupling and μh,μs are the supersymmetric Higgs and singlet mass terms respectively. yu,yd,ye are the Yukawa couplings of the MSSM which should be understood as matrices in the family space, Q are the quark doublets, UR and DR are the quark singlets, L are the lepton doublets and ER are the lepton singlets. After supersymmetry breaking the scalar potential of the Higgs sector develops soft terms which read

[formula]

where mj are the soft scalar masses, Ay the A-term and m23,b2s are the b-term and bilinear soft term of the singlet respectively.

The explicit computation of the scalar CP-even Higgs potential shows that the condition, at the scale MSS,

[formula]

with μ  =  μh + ys〈S〉 and 23 = m23 + ys(Aλ  +  μs)〈S〉, generates a massless Higgs field given by the combination

[formula]

where ε is the antisymmetric tensor and the angle β is determined by

[formula]

with [formula] evaluated at the scale MSS. It can be easily seen that the choice of superpotential in equation [\eqref=Wnmssm] yields 〈S〉  ≪  mEW and thus the singlet contribution to μ is suppressed and can be neglected. Moreover, this implies effective quadratic terms are subleading and hence the fine-tuning conditions in [\eqref=ft] and [\eqref=tanbeta] are identical to the MSSM case.

Assuming the generic situation that the susy particles get masses of O(MSS) they can be integrated out, leaving an effective Standard Model description at energies below the cutoff scale MSS. Furthermore, the explicit computation of the effective Lagrangian provides the boundary condition for the quartic coupling in the Standard Model potential given in [\eqref=V_SM]. These are the so called matching conditions and at tree level they read

[formula]

where

[formula]

The first term in [\eqref=lam] is the well known D-term contribution in the MSSM while the second term appears only in the singlet-extension. The latter is generated by two effects, an F-term contribution generated by the Yukawa interaction that couples the singlet to the Higgs, and an extra contribution (proportional to δ) originated from integrating out the singlet. Interestingly, the denominator in [\eqref=delta] corresponds to the mass of the (CP-even) scalar singlet and, thus, it is positive. In turn, δ can only take positive values and the correction to λ(MSS) is always negative.

The matching given in [\eqref=lam] receives higher order threshold corrections (δλth) that for the MSSM were originally computed at one loop level in [\cite=Giudice:2011cg] (and recently reviewed in [\cite=Bagnaschi:2014rsa] with leading two loop effect). We follow [\cite=Bagnaschi:2014rsa] and parametrize the corrections as follows

[formula]

These originate from the change of renormalization schemes that relate the gauge couplings in the [formula] scheme to the [formula] scheme ([formula]) and from integrating out the heavy scalars (Δλ1lφ) and fermionic superpartners (Δλ1lχ1,2). The effect induced from stop mixing is also included, with the stop mixing parameter defined as

[formula]

Before finishing this section it is worth noticing that, as long as one does not assume a special pattern of soft terms, the free parameters that determine λ(MSS) in [\eqref=lam] are

[formula]

However, if the soft terms are specified, the corresponding soft parameters at MSS completely determine tan β and δ via [\eqref=tanbeta] and [\eqref=delta] respectively.

Calculation of the Higgs mass

The Standard Model Higgs potential reads

[formula]

where [formula] is the the Higgs vacuum expectation value. From [\eqref=V_SM] one immediately learns that value the of λ determines the Higgs mass Mh at loop level via

[formula]

It is worth recalling that the top Yukawa coupling yt is fixed at loop level by the mass of the top quark through

[formula]

δλ and δt parametrize the threshold corrections at the renormalization scale (mt) that were originally computed in [\cite=Sirlin:1985ux] and [\cite=Chetyrkin:1999qi] respectively. The state-of-the-art computations are given at the two loop level (and dominant three loop correction for yt) in [\cite=Buttazzo:2013uya].

Matching at MSS

We perform the numerical calculations using a modified version of SPheno-3.3.6 [\cite=Porod:2003um] [\cite=Porod:2011nf] created by SARAH-4.5.8 [\cite=Staub:2008uz] [\cite=Staub:2010jh] [\cite=Staub:2013tta]. Given λ(MSS) the Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs) are calculated at two-loop-level to yield the couplings at the weak scale. All couplings are renormalized at one loop at mt in the [formula] scheme and the corresponding Higgs mass is thus calculated at one loop level. For the top Yukawa coupling we include the two loop and dominant three loop QCD correction given in eq.57 in [\cite=Buttazzo:2013uya]. For completeness we provide the values of the SM parameters used in the calculations

[formula]

A theoretical uncertainty on the Higgs mass of [formula] is generically applied to supersymmetric models. This was computed within the MSSM in [\cite=Degrassi:2002fi], assuming low energy values of the SUSY-breaking scale. The computation was recently reviewed in [\cite=Vega:2015fna], for arbitrary (large) values of the SUSY-breaking scale and yielded a [formula] uncertainty for the Higgs mass. In the following we use this result.

Matching at MGUT

In this section we explain how to obtain λ(MSS) from a set of universal soft terms at the GUT scale,these are specified in [\eqref=softterms]. The procedure to calculate λ(MSS) goes as follows. The values of the gauge and top Yukawa couplings in the NMSSM, ĝ1,ĝ2,ĝ3,ŷt, are fixed by the corresponding g1,g2,g3,yt in the SM via the matching conditions at MSS. The matching conditions are given at tree level by

[formula]

and receive one loop threshold corrections which can be found in [\cite=Bagnaschi:2014rsa]. However, gauge couplings only enter in the calculation of the Higgs mass via the RGEs for the soft terms and thus, higher order corrections can be neglected. With ŷt,ĝ1,ĝ2,ĝ3 at hand we run from MSS up to MGUT, with the RGEs of the NMSSM at two loops, to calculate ŷt0,ĝ10,ĝ20,ĝ30. Using the latter boundary conditions for gauge and top Yukawa couplings together with [\eqref=softterms] we implement the RGEs of the NMSSM again at the two loop level for Yukawa and gauge couplings and at one loop level for the soft parameters, to obtain the corresponding soft terms at MSS. The RGEs are given in [\cite=Ellwanger:2009dp] and we neglect the contribution of all Yukawa couplings except ŷt. The soft parameters at MSS determine the values of tan β and δ via the eqs. [\eqref=tanbeta] and [\eqref=delta] respectively which yield λ(MSS) through [\eqref=lam]. The one loop corrections given in [\eqref=lam_threshold], using the stop mixing in [\eqref=stopmixing] are also included. With the value of λ(MSS) at hand, we proceed as in [\ref=matchingMSS].

The Higgs mass as a function of MSS

In this section we study the Higgs mass as a function of MSS, varying the NMSSM parameters [\eqref=freepar] that determine the value of λ(MSS) in [\eqref=lam]. In section [\ref=UVdependence] we proceed as before but using the values of tan β and δ in λ(MSS) computed from universal patterns of soft terms at the GUT scale.

λ > 0 at SUSY-breaking scale

To begin with, notice that the MSSM-like contribution to [\eqref=lam] vanishes for tan β equal to one, while the NMSSM piece is maximized. From this observation we learn that in the NMSSM low values of tan β can severely lessen the upper bound of MSS as ys increases. In Figure [\ref=plot1] and [\ref=plot2] we plot the Higgs mass as a function of MSS for different values of ys, assuming δ = 0 and tan β = 1,2 respectively. For large tan β the situation resembles the MSSM case [\cite=Giudice:2011cg] [\cite=Cabrera:2011bi]. In this regime the first term in [\eqref=lam] is maximized and thus pulls MSS to low energies while the NMSSM term is almost vanishing regardless of the value of ys.

λ < 0 at SUSY-breaking scale

As can be seen from [\eqref=lam] by setting δ = 0, all universal contributions are strictly positive. This implies that independently of the values of the parameters in the supersymmetric theory, there exists a strict upper bound on MSS (within uncertainties) fixed by the scale μ0 at which λ(μ0) vanishes, equivalently, the scale at which the SM becomes unstable. The state-of-the-art computation yields [formula] [\cite=Buttazzo:2013uya]. However, if λ(MSS) can be matched to the expected negative value determined by the running of λ in the SM, the upper bound on MSS disappears. In Figures [\ref=plot1] and [\ref=plot2] we plot the Higgs mass for various ys, using δ =  - 2 and tan β = 1,2 respectively. In these examples it can be clearly seen that MSS could take values up to [formula].

Universal soft terms at [formula]

As already anticipated, in this section we study the Higgs mass as a function of MSS assuming an underlying structure of universal soft terms at the GUT scale. In the NMSSM these are specified by the following parameters

[formula]

where M0 denote the gaugino masses and the remaining soft terms are as introduced in section [\ref=settingNMSSM]. The subindex 0 indicates that the values are defined at the GUT scale, with [formula]. Examples of universal soft terms in string theory can be obtained e.g. in the dilaton domination scenario [\cite=Louis:2014pia].

Notice from [\eqref=tanbeta] that tan β is equal to one at the GUT scale and as [formula] run, tan β evolves accordingly. However, tan β remains close to one for large values of MSS. In other words, the unification (or universality) of soft masses predicts small values of tan β, as already pointed out in [\cite=Ibanez:2013gf]. For low values of the SUSY-breaking scale, m2hu becomes smaller and eventually changes sign, at this point there is a sudden increase of tan β.

On the other hand, [formula] appearing in δ do not run for small values of ys and stay equal to their boundary conditions at the GUT scale. Thus, the running of δ is induced by μh and Aλ. As long as there are no hierarchies among the couplings, δ stays constant at large MSS and increases for low values of the SUSY-breaking scale.

In sum, two effects determine the Higgs mass in this scheme. At large values of MSS, tan β takes very small values and so enhances the NMSSM correction to λ(MSS). In this regime, δ does not significantly vary and, thus, the Higgs mass dependence upon MSS is (almost) constant. Furthermore, by tuning the value of ys near O(10- 2), the Higgs mass can be easily accommodated in the experimental bound. For lower values of MSS, tan β starts to increase and thus λ(MSS) becomes insensitive to the NMSSM correction. The latter competes with the MSSM contribution which grows with tan β. The sum of these two terms leads to a slow decrease of the Higgs mass with MSS.

In Figure [\ref=plot3] we show the Higgs mass as a function of MSS for the following choice of soft masses at the GUT scale, i.e. m0 = M0  =  μs0, b2s0 =  - μ2s and A0  =  μh0 =  - 1.5M0, and various ys. As ys decreases the upper bound on MSS approaches the lower bound of [formula], that corresponds to the limit of tan β = 1 and ys = 0. Whereas increasing ys enhances the NMSSM negative contribution to λ(MSS) and, thus, pushes MSS to larger values. Similarly, in Figure [\ref=plot4] (left), by fixing ys we show the effect of lowering λ(MSS) by incrementing δ. This can be achieved by taking smaller values for the soft masses.

Notice that in the limit of vanishing ys, the NMSSM contribution to λ(MSS) is negligible. Hence, larger tan β values raise the Higgs mass at low energies. This effect is manifest depending on the choice of soft terms, in particular of μh0. In Figure [\ref=plot4] (right) we show the Higgs mass as a function of MSS for fixed ys and the same soft terms as before but varying μh0. As seen in Figure [\ref=plot4], for lower μh0, tan β becomes larger and boosts the Higgs mass.

Conclusions

In this letter we studied the Higgs mass in the NMSSM within High-Scale Supersymmetry. In this setup, the low energy effective theory is described by the Standard Model and the respective couplings, in particular the quartic coupling λ, are fixed by the supersymmetric theory at the SUSY-breaking scale MSS. In the MSSM this matching sets λ(MSS) to a positive (or vanishing) value and, thus, sets an upper bound [formula]. In the NMSSM, λ(MSS) receives additional tree level corrections given in [\eqref=lam]. The latter allow λ(MSS) to take negative values, and, thus, the SUSY-breaking scale can take any value up to the GUT scale. In this work, we computed the Higgs mass as a function of the SUSY-breaking scale varying the NMSSM parameters. The results are summarized in Figures [\ref=plot1] and [\ref=plot2]. For large values of MSS, the Higgs mass becomes almost constant and can be easily adjusted to the experimental bound [formula].

In addition, we studied special scenarios of supersymmetry breaking. In particular, we assumed universal soft terms at the GUT scale to constrain the NMSSM parameters appearing in λ(MSS). The unification of masses yields low values of tan β at large MSS and, thus, enhances the NMSSM negative contribution to λ(MSS). For

[formula]

the Higgs mass stays almost constant, and its value can be easily accomodated within the experimental bound. For lower values of MSS consistency with the Higgs mass becomes more model dependent and requires small NMSSM contributions to λ(MSS). Furthermore, in this regime the soft masses spread out and, thus, one loop contributions to λ(MSS) become large. Hence, for low values of MSS the determination of the Higgs mass relies on the details of the soft parameters.

To conclude, even if not directly accessible at the LHC, scenarios with large SUSY-breaking scales can be probed via the measured value of the Higgs mass. Furthermore, improved measurements of the top mass will help constraining the parameters, and in particular MSS. Furthermore, as we have studied in this letter, the NMSSM can support SUSY-breaking scales near the GUT scale. These news are of particular interest for string phenomenology, since generic vacua in the landscape allow for supersymmetry breaking only at high scales. It might be interesting to find explicit examples of the NMSSM from string derived setups. Provided specific patterns of soft terms, these models could be tested.
