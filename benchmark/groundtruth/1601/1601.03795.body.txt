On the mixed joint functional independence of a class of zeta-functions

11M41, 11M35.

Introduction

The history of the problem on the functional independence of Dirichlet series goes back to the famous lecture of D. Hilbert [\cite=HilPr-69] in 1900. He mentioned that the Riemann zeta-function ζ(s) does not satisfy any non-trivial algebraic differential equation.

Recall the definition of ζ(s). Let [formula] be the set of all prime numbers, and [formula] the set of all complex numbers. For [formula], ζ(s) is given by

[formula]

for σ > 1, and can be analytically continued to the whole complex plane [formula] except for a simple pole at the point s = 1 with residue 1.

In 1973, S.M. Voronin proved [\cite=SMV-73] the following functional independence result on ζ(s). Let [formula] and [formula] be the set of positive integers, and non-negative integers, respectively.

Let [formula] and [formula]. The function ζ(s) does not satisfy any differential equation

[formula]

for continuous functions Fj, [formula], not all identically zero.

Later this result was generalized to other zeta- and L-functions. For the survey, see the monographs by A. Laurin cikas [\cite=AL-96] and J. Steuding [\cite=JSt-07].

Nowadays in analytic number theory, the investigation of statistical properties (and also the functional independence) for a collection of various zeta-functions, some of them have the Euler product expansion and others do not have, is a very interesting problem since an important role is played by parameters included in the definition of those functions.

The first result in this direction is due to H. Mishou. In 2007, he proved [\cite=HM-07] that the pair of zeta-functions consisting of the Riemann zeta-function ζ(s) and the Hurwitz zeta-function ζ(s,α) is functionally independent.

We recall that the Hurwitz zeta-function ζ(s,α) with a fixed parameter α, 0 < α  ≤  1, is defined by the Dirichlet series

[formula]

for σ > 1, and can be continued to the whole complex plane, except, for a simple pole at the point s = 1 with residue 1. In general, the function ζ(s,α) has no Euler product over primes, except for the cases α = 1 and [formula], when ζ(s,α) is essentially reduced to ζ(s). Then Mishou's result is the following statement.

This is the first "mixed joint" functional independence theorem. Later this result was generalized to the collection of a periodic zeta-function and a periodic Hurwitz zeta-function by the first-named author and A. Laurin cikas in [\cite=RK-AL-11].

In this paper, we will prove rather general result on the mixed joint functional independence for a class of zeta-functions, consisting of the so-called Matsumoto zeta-functions and periodic Hurwitz zeta-functions.

The present paper is a continuation of [\cite=RK-KM-15], whose contents were presented in the 29th Journées Arithmétiques held at Debrecen, Hungary, in July 2015. The authors express their gratitude to the organizers for giving the chance of the presentation, and their hospitality.

Statement of the first main result

Let [formula] be a periodic sequence of complex numbers (not all zero) with minimal period [formula], and 0 < α  ≤  1. In 2006, A. Javtokas and A. Laurin cikas [\cite=AJ-AL-06] introduced the periodic Hurwitz zeta-function [formula]. For σ > 1, it is given by the series

[formula]

It is known that

[formula]

Therefore the function [formula] can be analytically continued to the whole complex plane, except for a possible simple pole at the point s = 1 with residue

[formula]

If b = 0, the corresponding periodic Hurwitz zeta-function is an entire function.

The functional independence of periodic Hurwitz zeta-functions was proved by A. Laurin cikas in [\cite=AL-08].

Now we recall the definition of the polynomial Euler products [formula], or, so-called Matsumoto zeta-functions.

Let, for [formula], [formula], and, for [formula] and 1  ≤  j  ≤  g(m), [formula]. Denote by pm the mth prime number, and [formula]. The zeta-function [formula] was introduced by the second-named author in [\cite=KM-90], and it is defined by the polynomial Euler product

[formula]

Suppose that

[formula]

with a positive constant C1 and non-negative constants α and β. In view of [\eqref=km-eq-2], the function [formula] converges absolutely for σ  >  α  +  β + 1 (see Appendix), and hence in this region it can be expressed as the Dirichlet series

[formula]

with coefficients [formula]. For brevity, denote the shifted version of the function [formula] by

[formula]

with [formula]. Then, for σ > 1, the series on the right-hand side of [\eqref=km-eq-3] converges absolutely.

The aim of this paper is to obtain a mixed joint functional independence of the collection of zeta-functions consisting of the Matsumoto zeta-function φ(s) belonging to the Steuding subclass [formula], defined below, and periodic Hurwitz zeta-functions [formula].

We say that the function φ(s) belongs to the class [formula] if following conditions are satisfied:

there exists a Dirichlet series expansion

[formula]

with a(m) = O(mε) for every ε > 0;

there exists σφ < 1 such that φ(s) can be meromorphically continued to the half-plane σ  >  σφ;

there exists a constant c  ≥  0 such that

[formula]

for every fixed σ  >  σφ and ε > 0;

there exists the Euler product expansion over prime numbers, i.e.,

[formula]

there exists a constant κ > 0 such that

[formula]

where π(x) denotes the number of primes p, p  ≤  x.

This class was introduced by J. Steuding in [\cite=JSt-07], and is a subclass of the class of Matsumoto zeta-functions. For [formula], let σ* be the infimum of all σ1 for which

[formula]

holds for any σ  ≥  σ1. Then it is known that [formula] (see [\cite=JSt-07]).

We state the first main result of this paper in the following theorem.

Suppose that α is a transcendental number, and the function φ(s) belongs to the class [formula]. Let [formula], [formula], and the function [formula] be continuous for [formula]. If

[formula]

is identically zero, then [formula] for [formula].

Proof of Theorem 1

To the proof of the mixed joint functional independence for the functions φ(s) and [formula], we need two further propositions: the mixed joint universality theorem and the so-called denseness lemma.

Mixed joint universality of the functions φ(s) and [formula]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=km-thm-1] is based on the mixed joint universality theorem in the Voronin sense for the functions φ(s) and [formula]. It was obtained by the authors in [\cite=RK-KM-15]. We will give the statement of this universality theorem as a lemma. Let [formula] be the set of real numbers, and [formula] for any a < b. For any compact subset [formula], denote by Hc(K) the set of all [formula]-valued continuous functions defined on K, holomorphic in the interior of K. By Hc0(K) we mean the subset of Hc(K) consisting of all elements which are non-vanishing on K.

Suppose that [formula], and α is a transcendental number. Let K1 be a compact subset of D(σ*,1), and K2 be a compact subset of [formula], both with connected complements. Suppose that f1∈Hc0(K1) and f2∈Hc(K2). Then, for every ε > 0,

[formula]

where μ{A} denotes the Lebesgue measure of the measurable set [formula].

Note that for the proof of Lemma [\ref=km-lem-1] we use the joint mixed limit theorem in the sense of weakly convergent probability measures for the Matsumoto zeta-functions φ(s) and the periodic Hurwitz zeta-function [formula]. It was proved by the authors in [\cite=RK-KM-15].

A denseness lemma

For the proof of Theorem [\ref=km-thm-1], we need a denseness lemma.

Define the map [formula] by the formula

[formula]

with [formula].

Suppose that α is transcendental. Then the image of [formula] by u is dense in [formula].

We will give a sketch, since the proof follows in the same way as Lemma 13 from [\cite=RK-AL-11] (see, also, [\cite=HM-07]).

We can find a sequence [formula], lim m  →    ∞τm  =    ∞  , such that the inequalities

[formula]

and

[formula]

hold for every ε > 0 and arbitrary complex numbers slj, l = 1,2, [formula]. To show this, we consider the polynomial

[formula]

Then, for [formula] and l = 1,2, we have

[formula]

Now, in view of Lemma [\ref=km-lem-1] and repeating analogous arguments as in the proof of Lemma 13 from [\cite=RK-AL-11], we can prove the existence of the above sequence {τm} and obtain that the image of [formula] by the map u is dense in [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=km-thm-1]

Now we are ready to complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=km-thm-1]. The essential idea is due to Voronin (see, for example, [\cite=SMV-77]). We first prove that [formula].

Suppose that [formula]. It follows that there exists a point

[formula]

such that [formula]. From the continuity of the function Fn, we find a bounded domain [formula] such that [formula], and, for all ∈G,

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=km-lem-2], there exists a sequence [formula], lim m  →    ∞τm  =    ∞  , such that

[formula]

But this together with [\eqref=km-eq-4] contradicts to the hypothesis of the theorem if τm is sufficiently large. Hence, [formula].

Similarly we can show [formula], inductively. The proof is complete.

A generalization

The mixed joint universality and the mixed joint functional independence theorem can be obtained in the following more general situation.

Suppose that αj be a real number with 0 < αj < 1, [formula], [formula], and [formula]. For each j and l, 1  ≤  j  ≤  r, 1  ≤  l  ≤  l(j), let [formula] be a periodic sequence of complex numbers (not all zero) with the minimal period kjl, and let [formula] be the corresponding periodic Hurwitz zeta-function. Denote by kj the least common multiple of periods [formula]. Let Bj be the matrix consisting of coefficients bmjl from the periodic sequences [formula], [formula], [formula], i.e.,

[formula]

The functional independence for the above collection of periodic Hurwitz zeta-functions was proved by A. Laurin cikas in [\cite=AL-08] under a certain matrix condition. The proof is based on the joint universality theorem among periodic Hurwitz zeta-functions proved by J. Steuding in [\cite=JSt-03].

For the proof of mixed joint functional independence, we may adopt the method developed in series of works by A. Laurin cikas and his colleagues (see, for example, [\cite=JG-RM-SR-DS-10], [\cite=AL-DS-12], [\cite=VP-DS-14]). Then it is possible to obtain the following generalization of Theorem [\ref=km-thm-1].

Suppose that [formula] are algebraically independent over [formula], rankBj = l(j), 1  ≤  j  ≤  r, and φ(s) belongs to the class [formula]. Let the function [formula] be a continuous function for each [formula]. Suppose that the function

[formula]

is identically zero. Then [formula] for [formula].

This theorem is a consequence of the following mixed joint universality theorem, which is a generalization of Lemma [\ref=km-lem-1]. This theorem is also an analogue of a result of J. Genys, R. Macaitien, S. Ra ckauskien and D.  Siau ciūnas [\cite=JG-RM-SR-DS-10], which treats the case that φ(s) is replaced by ζ(s).

Suppose that [formula] are algebraically independent over [formula], rankBj = l(j), 1  ≤  j  ≤  r, and φ(s) belongs to the class [formula]. Let K1 be a compact subset of D(σ*,1), K2jl be compact subsets of [formula], all of which with connected complements. Suppose that f1∈Hc0(K1) and f2jl∈Hc(K2jl). Then, for every ε > 0,

[formula]

Consider the case when all l(j) = 1, 1  ≤  j  ≤  r. Write [formula]. In this case, the condition rankBj = l(j) trivially holds. Therefore the joint universality and the functional independence among the functions φ(s), [formula] are valid without any matrix condition, only under the assumption that [formula] are algebraically independent over [formula]. When A. Laurin cikas started his study on the universality of periodic Hurwitz zeta-functions, he assumed various matrix-type conditions, but finally, the joint universality among periodic Hurwitz zeta-functions without any matrix condition was established by A. Laurin cikas and S. Skerstonait in [\cite=AL-SS-09a]. Our Theorems [\ref=km-thm-2] and [\ref=km-thm-3] include the "mixed" generalization of this theorem.

Proof of Theorems [\ref=km-thm-2] and [\ref=km-thm-3]

In the proof of Theorems [\ref=km-thm-2] and [\ref=km-thm-3], the crucial role is played by a mixed joint limit theorem in the sense of weakly convergent probability measures in the space of analytic functions.

A generalized mixed joint limit theorem

Let D1 be an open subset of D(σ*,1), and D2 be an open subset of [formula]. For any set S, by B(S) we denote the set of all Borel subsets of S. For any region D, denote by H(D) the set of all holomorphic functions on D. Let [formula] be the Cartesian product of λ + 1 such spaces, i.e.

[formula]

Moreover, let

[formula]

where γp  =  γ for all [formula], γm  =  γ for all [formula], and [formula], and define

[formula]

where Ω2j  =  Ω2 for all j = 1,...,r. Then by the Tikhonov theorem Ω is a compact topological Abelian group also. Then we have the probability space [formula]. Here [formula] is the product of Haar measures mH1,mH21,...,mH2r, where mH1 is the probability Haar measure on (Ω1,B(Ω1)) and mH2j is the probability Haar measure on (Ω2j,B(Ω2j)), j = 1,...,r. Let ω1(p) be the projection of ω1∈Ω1 to γp, and, for every [formula], define

[formula]

with respect to the factorization of m to primes. Denote by ω2j(m) the projection of ω2j∈Ω2j to γm, [formula], j = 1,...,r.

For brevity, write [formula], [formula], [formula], and

[formula]

Let [formula]. Define the [formula]-valued random element (,,ω;) on the probability space [formula] by the formula

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

respectively. These series are convergent for almost all ω1∈Ω1 and ω2j∈Ω2j, j = 1,...,r. Denote by [formula] the distribution of the random element (,,ω;), i.e.,

[formula]

Now we are ready to state our mixed joint limit theorem for the functions φ(s), [formula] [formula] as a lemma.

Suppose that the numbers α1,...,αr are algebraically independent over [formula], and [formula]. Then the probability measure PT defined by

[formula]

converges weakly to [formula] as T  →    ∞  .

When r = 1 and l(1) = 1, this lemma is Theorem 2.1 from [\cite=RK-KM-15]. On the other hand, the same type of limit theorem with φ replaced by the Riemann zeta-function is given in [\cite=JG-RM-SR-DS-10]. The proof of the above lemma is quite similar to that of those results, so here we give a very brief outline.

Let φn(s), φn(s,1), [formula], [formula] be the same as in [\cite=RK-KM-15], and define

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula]. The probability measures PT,n, P̂T,n and P̂T on [formula] are defined similarly as PT in [\eqref=def-P_T], with replacing ( + iτ,;) by n( + iτ,;), [formula] and [formula], respectively. As an analogue of [\cite=RK-KM-15] or [\cite=JG-RM-SR-DS-10], we can show that both measures PT,n and P̂T,n converge weakly to a certain probability measure Pn as T  →    ∞  . (In the course of the proof, a key is Lemma 1 from [\cite=JG-RM-SR-DS-10], which is based on the assumption that α1,...,αr are algebraically independent over [formula].)

Next we need an approximation lemma in the mean value sense, similar to [\cite=RK-KM-15]. In the proof of [\cite=RK-KM-15], we used the result of [\cite=AJ-AL-06]. The desired approximation can be shown by using, instead of [\cite=AJ-AL-06], mean value results given in [\cite=AL-SS-09b].

Then we can prove that both PT and P̂T converge weakly to a certain probability measure P. This is an analogue of [\cite=RK-KM-15] or [\cite=JG-RM-SR-DS-10]. Finally we can show that [formula], by the usual ergodic argument. This completes the proof of Lemma [\ref=thm-rk].

Completion of the proof

Now we complete the proof of Theorems [\ref=km-thm-2] and [\ref=km-thm-3]. Hereafter we assume that [formula] are algebraically independent over [formula], rankBj = l(j), 1  ≤  j  ≤  r, and φ(s) belongs to the class [formula].

Let Sφ be the set of all f∈H(D1) which is non-vanishing on D1, or constantly [formula] on D1.

The support of the measure [formula] is Sφ  ×  H(D2)λ.

This can be shown just analogously to [\cite=JG-RM-SR-DS-10]. Then Theorem [\ref=km-thm-3] follows from Lemmas [\ref=thm-rk] and [\ref=lem-support] by the standard argument; see again [\cite=JG-RM-SR-DS-10].

Next, as a generalization of Lemma [\ref=km-lem-2], we can show that the image of the map [formula] by the formula

[formula]

is dense in [formula]. Using this denseness result, similar to the proof of Theorem [\ref=km-thm-1], we obtain the assertion of Theorem [\ref=km-thm-2].

Appendix

Here we give a comment on [\cite=KM-90]. On p.179 of [\cite=KM-90], it is mentioned that the Euler product [\eqref=km-eq-1] is convergent absolutely, under the condition [\eqref=km-eq-2], in the region σ  >  α  +  β + 1. This can be seen by the estimate

[formula]

and hence the Dirichlet series expansion [\eqref=km-eq-2.5] is also valid in that region.

In the same page of [\cite=KM-90], the estimate [formula] is also stated. However this is to be amended as follows. From [\eqref=km-eq-1] we have

[formula]

where [formula] means the summation over all tuples [formula] of non-negative integers satisfying

[formula]

Denote by C(m,l) the number of such tuples. Using [\eqref=km-eq-2] we obtain

[formula]

To estimate C(m,l), it suffices to consider the case when [formula], and in this case

[formula]

Therefore [formula], which yields, if [formula],

[formula]

where Ω(k) denotes the total number of prime divisors of k.

For any ε > 0, we see that C1pαm  ≤  pα  +  εm if m is sufficiently large, and then [formula]. This implies [formula], if all prime factors of k are large.
