Total monochromatic connection of graphs

Introduction

In this paper, all graphs are simple, finite and undirected. We refer to the book [\cite=B] for undefined notation and terminology in graph theory. Throughout this paper, let n and m denote the order (number of vertices) and size (number of edges) of a graph, respectively. Moreover, a vertex of a connected graph is called a leaf if its degree is one; otherwise, it is an internal vertex. Let l(T) and q(T) denote the number of leaves and the number of internal vertices of a tree T, respectively, and let l(G) =  max {l(T)| T is a spanning tree of G } and q(G) =  min {q(T)| T is a spanning tree of G } for a connected graph G. Note that the sum of l(G) and q(G) is n for any connected graph G of order n. A path in an edge-colored graph is a monochromatic path if all the edges on the path have the same color. An edge-coloring of a connected graph is a monochromatically-connecting coloring (MC-coloring, for short) if any two vertices of the graph are connected by a monochromatic path of the graph. For a connected graph G, the monochromatic connection number of G, denoted by mc(G), is defined as the maximum number of colors used in an MC-coloring of G. An extremal MC-coloring is an MC-coloring that uses mc(G) colors. Note that mc(G) = m if and only if G is a complete graph. The concept of mc(G) was first introduced by Caro and Yuster [\cite=CY] and has been well-studied recently. We refer the reader to [\cite=CLW] [\cite=GLQZ] for more details.

As a natural counterpart of the concept of monochromatic connection, Cai et al. [\cite=CLW1] introduced the concept of monochromatic vertex connection. A path in a vertex-colored graph is a vertex-monochromatic path if its internal vertices have the same color. A vertex-coloring of a graph is a monochromatically-vertex-connecting coloring (MVC-coloring, for short) if any two vertices of the graph are connected by a vertex-monochromatic path of the graph. For a connected graph G, the monochromatic vertex connection number, denoted by mvc(G), is defined as the maximum number of colors used in an MVC-coloring of G. An extremal MVC-coloring is an MVC-coloring that uses mvc(G) colors. Note that mvc(G) = n if and only if diam(G)  ≤  2.

Actually, the concepts of monochromatic connection number mc(G) and monochromatic vertex connection number mvc(G) are natural opposite concepts of rainbow connection number rc(G) and rainbow vertex connection number rvc(G). For details about them we refer to a book [\cite=LiS] and a survey paper [\cite=LiSS]. Moreover, the concept of total rainbow connection number trc(G) in [\cite=LMS1] was motivated by the rainbow connection number rc(G) and rainbow vertex connection number rvc(G). Thus, here we introduce the concept of total monochromatic connection of graphs. A graph is said to be total-colored if all the edges and the vertices of the graph are colored. A path in a total-colored graph is a total monochromatic path if all the edges and internal vertices on the path have the same color. A total-coloring of a graph is a total monochromatically-connecting coloring (TMC-coloring, for short) if any two vertices of the graph are connected by a total monochromatic path of the graph. For a connected graph G, the total monochromatic connection number, denoted by tmc(G), is defined as the maximum number of colors used in a TMC-coloring of G. An extremal TMC-coloring is a TMC-coloring that uses tmc(G) colors. It is easy to check that tmc(G) = m + n if and only if G is a complete graph.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we prove that tmc(G)  ≥  m - n + 2 + l(G) for any connected graph and determine the value of tmc(G) for some special graphs. In Section 3, we prove that there are many graphs with tmc(G) = m - n + 2 + l(G) which are restricted by other graph parameters such as the maximum degree, the diameter and so on, and moreover, we show that for almost all graphs G, tmc(G) = m - n + 2 + l(G) holds. In Section 4, we compare tmc(G) with mvc(G) and mc(G), respectively, and obtain that there exist graphs G such that tmc(G) is not less than mvc(G) and vice versa, and that tmc(G) = mc(G) + l(G) for almost all graphs. Moreover, we prove that tmc(G)  ≤  mc(G) + mvc(G), and the equality holds if and only if G is a complete graph.

Preliminary results

In this section, we show that tmc(G)  ≥  m - n + 2 + l(G) and present some preliminary results on the total monochromatic connection number. Moreover, we determine the value of tmc(G) when G is a tree, a wheel, and a complete multipartite graph. The following fact is easily seen.

Since for any two vertices of a tree, there exists only one path connecting them, we have the following result.

The consequence below is immediate from Propositions [\ref=pro1] and [\ref=pro2].

For a connected graph G, tmc(G)  ≥  m - n + 2 + l(G).

Let G be a connected graph and f be an extremal TMC-coloring of G that uses a given color c. Note that the subgraph H formed by the edges and vertices colored c is connected, or we will give a fresh color to all the edges and vertices colored c in some of these components while still maintaining a TMC-coloring. Moreover, the color of each internal vertex of H is c. Otherwise, let [formula] be the internal vertices of H such that each of them is not colored c. We obtain the subgraph H0 by deleting the vertices [formula]. If H0 is connected, it is possible to choose an edge incident with u1 and assign it with a fresh color while still maintaining a TMC-coloring. If not, we can give a fresh color to all the edges and vertices colored c in some of these components while still maintaining a TMC-coloring. Furthermore, H does not contain any cycle; otherwise, a fresh color can be assigned to any edge of the cycle while still maintaining a TMC-coloring. Thus, H is a tree where the color of each internal vertex is c. Now we define the color tree as the tree formed by the edges and vertices colored c, denoted by Tc. If Tc has at least two edges, the color c is called nontrivial. Otherwise, c is trivial. We call an extremal TMC-coloring simple if for any two nontrivial colors c and d, the corresponding trees Tc and Td intersect in at most one vertex. If f is simple, then the leaves of Tc must have distinct colors different from color c. Otherwise, we can give a fresh color to such a leaf while still maintaining a TMC-coloring. Moreover, a nontrivial color tree of f with m' edges and q' internal vertices is said to waste m' - 1 + q' colors. For the rest of this paper we will use these facts without further mentioning them.

The lemma below shows that one can always find a simple extremal TMC-coloring for a connected graph.

Every connected graph G has a simple extremal TMC-coloring.

Proof. We are given an extremal TMC-coloring f of G with the most number of trivial colors, and then we prove that this coloring must be simple. Suppose that there exist two nontrivial colors c and d such that Tc and Td contain k common vertices denoted by [formula], where k  ≥  2. Now we divide our discussion into two cases.

Case 1. For 1  ≤  i  ≤  k, ui is an internal vertex of Tc or Td.

For 1  ≤  i  ≤  k, if ui is an internal vertex of Tc, ui must be a leaf of Td and then set ei = uiwi where wi is the neighbor of ui in Td; otherwise, ui must be a leaf of Tc and then put ei = uivi where vi is the neighbor of ui in Tc. Let H denote the subgraph consisting of the edges and vertices of [formula]. Clearly, H is connected. We obtain a spanning tree H0 of H by deleting the edges [formula]. Now we change the total-coloring of H while still maintaining the colors of the leaves in H0 unchanged. Assign the edges and internal vertices of H0 with color c and the remaining edges [formula] with distinct new colors. Obviously, the new total-coloring is also a TMC-coloring and uses k - 2 more colors than our original one. So, it either uses more colors or uses the same number of colors but more trivial colors, contradicting the assumption on f.

Case 2. There exists a vertex among [formula], say u1, which is a leaf of both Tc and Td.

Let v1 and w1 be the neighbors of u1 in Tc and Td, respectively. There must be another color tree Te (including a single edge) connecting v1 and w1. For 1  ≤  i  ≤  k, if ui is a leaf of Tc, then set ei = uivi where vi is the neighbor of ui in Tc; otherwise, ui must be a leaf of Td and then put ei = uiwi where wi is the neighbor of ui in Td. Let H1 denote the subgraph consisting of the edges and vertices of [formula]. We obtain a spanning subgraph H2 of H1 by deleting the edges [formula]. If Te and H2 do not have common leaves, let [formula]. Otherwise, let [formula] denote the common leaves of Te and H2. Set e'i = u'iv'i where v'i is the neighbor of u'i in Te for 1  ≤  i  ≤  t. And then let [formula]. Let H denote the subgraph consisting of the edges and vertices of [formula]. Clearly, H is connected. We obtain a spanning connected subgraph H0 of H by deleting the edges of E0. Now we change the total-coloring of H while still maintaining the colors of the leaves in H0 unchanged. Assign the edges and internal vertices of H0 with color c and the remaining edges of H (i.e., the edges of E0) with distinct new colors. Note that if v is a common leaf of either Tc and Td or Te and H2, it is also a leaf of H0. Obviously, the new total-coloring is also a TMC-coloring and uses at least k + t - 2 more colors than our original one. So, it either uses more colors or uses the same number of colors but more trivial colors, contradicting the assumption on f.

Now we use the above results to compute the total monochromatic connection numbers of wheel graphs and complete multipartite graphs.

Let G be a wheel Wn - 1 of order n  ≥  5. Then tmc(G) = m - n + 2 + l(G).

Proof. We are given a simple extremal TMC-coloring f of G. Note that m - n + 2 + l(G) = m + 1 and tmc(G)  ≥  m + 1 by Theorem [\ref=thm1]. Suppose that f consists of k nontrivial color trees, denoted by [formula]. In fact, we can always find two vertices with degree at least 4 if k  ≥  3, a contradiction. Likewise, if k = 2, G must be W4 and tmc(W4) = m + 1. Thus, assume that k = 1 and T1 is not spanning (Otherwise, tmc(G) = m - n + 2 + l(G)). Note that for every vertex v∉T1, there exist the total monochromatic paths connecting v and the |T1| vertices of T1. As f is simple, these paths are internally vertex-disjoint. Hence, deg(v)  ≥  |T1|. If |T1|  ≥  4, the n - 1 vertices with degree 3 of G must be in T1 and then T1 is a path. Thus, tmc(G) = m + n - (n - 3) - (n - 3) = m + 6 - n  ≤  m + 1. If |T1| = 3, then G must be W3 while n  ≥  5. Therefore, the proof is complete.

Let [formula] be a complete multipartite graph with [formula] and [formula]. Then tmc(G) = m + r - t.

Proof. The case that r = 2 is a special case of Theorem [\ref=thm3] whose proof is given in Section 3, so assume that r  ≥  3. Let f be a simple extremal TMC-coloring of G with maximum trivial colors. Suppose that f consists of k nontrivial color trees, denoted by [formula], where ti = |V(Ti)| and qi = q(Ti) for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. Now we divide our discussion into two cases.

Case 1. t = r.

In this case, every vertex appears in at least one of the nontrivial color trees. Note that m - n + 2 + l(G) = m and tmc(G)  ≥  m by Theorem [\ref=thm1]. If [formula], then we have that [formula]. Thus, tmc(G) = m. Suppose that [formula]. Now consider the subgraph G' consisting of the union of the Ti and let [formula] denote its components.

Now we may assume that there exists a component, say C1, such that each nontrivial color tree in C1 is a star. Let S be a star of C1 with center u and leaves [formula], where [formula] are in the same vertex class, say V1. Suppose that p'  ≥  2. Indeed, if p' = 1, we can give a new color to the edge uu1 while still maintaining a TMC-coloring. We claim that C1 contains a cycle. If p' < |V1|, there exists a vertex up + 1 of V1 not adjacent to u in S. Then u1 and up + 1 must be in a same nontrivial color tree and the same happens for up' and up + 1. These nontrivial color trees containing u1, up' and up + 1 must form a cycle. If p' = |V1|, we have that the vertices of the vertex class containing u must be in a same nontrivial color tree, or we will get a cycle in a similar way. By that analogy, we obtain a cycle formed by some centers of the nontrivial color trees in C1. Now we change the total-coloring of C1. We obtain a spanning tree T' of C1 by connecting u1 to the vertices in the same class with u and u to the other vertices of C1. We color the edges and internal vertices of T' with the same color and all other edges and vertices with distinct new colors. Clearly, this new total-coloring is also a TMC-coloring. However, it either uses more colors or uses the same number of colors but more trivial colors, contradicting the assumption on f.

Thus, suppose that there exists a nontrivial color tree of Ci, say Ti1, having two adjacent internal vertices ui and vi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  s. We obtain a spanning tree T by connecting v1 to each vertex in the same class with u1 of G and u1 to the other vertices of G. Now we give a new total-coloring f' of G. Color the edges and internal vertices of T with the same color and all other edges and vertices of G with distinct new colors. Obviously, f' is still a TMC-coloring. If s  ≥  2, then it either uses more colors or uses the same number of colors but more trivial colors than f, a contradiction. Thus, s = 1. Moreover, we can check that f' is a simple extremal TMC-coloring with maximum trivial colors. Therefore, tmc(G) = m.

Case 2. t < r.

We obtain a star S by connecting a vertex of [formula] to each vertex of [formula]. Color the edges and the center vertex of S with the same color and all other edges and vertices of G with distinct new colors. Clearly, this new total-coloring is still a TMC-coloring, denoted by f'. Thus, tmc(G)  ≥  m + r - t. If [formula], then we have that [formula]. Hence, tmc(G) = m + r - t. Suppose that [formula]. Next consider the subgraph G' consisting of the union of the Ti's and suppose that it has s components, say [formula]. Note that |V(G')|  ≥  n - r + t since any two vertices of the same class must be covered in a nontrivial color tree. The case that |V(G')| = n - r + t can be verified by a similar discussion to Case 1. Thus, suppose that |V(G')| > n - r + t. It is obvious that s  ≥  2. Moreover, there must exist a vertex x of [formula], which is contained in a component of G', say C1. For 2  ≤  j  ≤  s, there does not exist a vertex of [formula] in Cj. Otherwise, let x be the center of S and then f' either uses more colors or uses the same number of colors but more trivial colors than f, a contradiction. By a similar discussion to Case 1, we can obtain that there exists a nontrivial color tree of Cj having two adjacent internal vertices for 2  ≤  j  ≤  s. We obtain a star S1 by joining the vertices of [formula] to one internal vertex of C1. We give a new total-coloring of G while still maintaining the total-coloring of C1 unchanged. Assign the edges and the center vertex of S1 with one color and the other edges and vertices of [formula] with distinct new colors. This new total-coloring is still a TMC-coloring and it either uses more colors or uses the same number of colors but more trivial colors, contradicting the assumption on f. Therefore, we have finished the proof.

Graphs with tmc(G) = m - n + 2 + l(G)

In this section, we prove that there are many graphs G for which tmc(G) = m - n + 2 + l(G), even for almost all graphs.

[\cite=CY] Let G be a connected graph of order n > 3. If G satisfies any of the following properties, then mc(G) = m - n + 2.

(a) The complement [formula] of G is 4-connected.

(b) G is K3-free.

(c) [formula]. In particular, this holds if Δ(G)  ≤  (n + 1) / 2, and this also holds if Δ(G)  ≤  n - 2m / n.

(d) diam(G)  ≥  3.

(c) G has a cut vertex.

We can obtain that tmc(G)  ≤  mc(G) + l(G) for a noncomplete graph, whose proof is contained in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm6] in Section 4. In addition with Theorem [\ref=thm1] and Lemma [\ref=lem2], we have the following results.

Let G be a connected graph of order n > 3. If G satisfies any of the following properties, then tmc(G) = m - n + 2 + l(G).

(a) The complement [formula] of G is 4-connected.

(b) G is K3-free.

(c) [formula].

(d) diam(G)  ≥  3.

(c) G has a cut vertex.

One cannot hope to strengthen Theorem [\ref=thm2](c) by improving the upper bound of Δ(G). In fact, let G = Kn - 2,1,1. Then we have that tmc(G) = m - n + 3 + l(G) while the maximum degree is [formula].

From Theorem [\ref=thm2](a), we can get a stronger result. For a property P of graphs and a positive integer n, define Prob(P,n) to be the ratio of the number of graphs with n labeled vertices having P over the total number of graphs with these vertices. If Prob(P,n) approaches 1 as n tends to infinity, then we say that almost all graphs have the property P. See [\cite=BH] for example.

For almost all graphs G, we have that tmc(G) = m - n + 2 + l(G).

In order to prove Theorem [\ref=thm3], we need the following lemma.

[\cite=BH] For every nonnegative integer k, almost all graphs are k-connected.

Proof of Theorem 3: For any given nonnegative integer n, let [formula] denote the set of all graphs of order n, and let [formula] denote the set of all 4-connected graphs of order n. Moreover, let [formula] denote the set of all graphs G of order n such that the complement [formula] of G is 4-connected. Note that for any two graphs G and H, [formula] if and only if [formula]. Then, it is easy to check that the map: [formula] is a bijection from [formula] to [formula]. Therefore, we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem3], it follows that almost all graphs are 4-connected. Then, we get that almost all graphs have 4-connected complements. Furthermore, since almost all graphs are connected, we have that tmc(G) = m - n + 2 + l(G) by Theorem [\ref=thm2](a).

For the monochromatic connection number mc(G), from Lemma [\ref=lem2](a) and Lemma [\ref=lem3], one can deduce, in a similar way, that for almost all graphs G, mc(G) = m - n + 2 holds.

To use the parameter l(G) in the above formulas looks good. However, from [\cite=GS] we know that it is NP-hard to find a spanning tree that has maximum number of leaves in a connected graph G.

Compare tmc(G) with mvc(G) and mc(G)

Let G be a nontrivial connected graph. Firstly, we compare tmc(G) with mvc(G). The question we may ask is, can we bound one of tmc(G) and mvc(G) in terms of the other? The following two theorems give sufficient conditions for tmc(G) > mvc(G).

Let G be a connected graph with diameter d. If m  ≥  2n - d - 2, then tmc(G) > mvc(G).

Proof. The case that d = 1 is trivial, so assume that d  ≥  2. We can check that if l(G) = 2, then tmc(G) > mvc(G). Thus, suppose that l(G)  ≥  3. By Theorem [\ref=thm1], it follows that tmc(G)  ≥  m - n + 2 + l(G)  ≥  2n - d - 2 - n + 2 + 3 = n - d + 3. Moreover, we have that mvc(G)  ≤  n - d + 2 by [\cite=CLW1]. Therefore, tmc(G) > mvc(G).

Let G be a connected graph of diameter 2 with maximum degree Δ. If [formula], then tmc(G) > mvc(G).

Before proving Theorem [\ref=thm5], we need the lemma below.

[\cite=BO] Let G be a connected graph of diameter 2 with maximum degree Δ. Then

[formula]

Proof of Theorem 5: The case that n  ≤  7 can be easily verified. Suppose that n  ≥  8. Since the diameter of G is 2, we have that mvc(G) = n. By Theorem [\ref=thm1] and Lemma [\ref=lem4], tmc(G)  ≥  m - n + 2 + l(G) > n. Thus, tmc(G) > mvc(G).

Actually, we have that tmc(C5) = 4 < mvc(C5) = 5, where m < 2n - d - 2 and [formula]. This implies that the conditions of Theorems [\ref=thm4] and [\ref=thm5] cannot be improved. Moreover, if G is a star, then tmc(G) = mvc(G) = n. Therefore, there exist graphs G such that tmc(G) is not less than mvc(G) and vice versa. However, we cannot show whether there exist other graphs with tmc(G)  ≤  mvc(G). Thus, we propose the following problem.

Dose there exist a graph of order n  ≥  6 except a star such that tmc(G)  ≤  mvc(G)?

Next we compare tmc(G) with mc(G). If G satisfies one of the conditions in Theorem [\ref=thm2], then we have mc(G) = m - n + 2 and so tmc(G) = mc(G) + l(G). For a complete graph G, tmc(G) > mc(G) + l(G). From [\cite=CY], if G is a wheel Wn - 1 of order n  ≥  5, we have that mc(G) = m - n + 3 and then tmc(G) < mc(G) + l(G). However, by Theorem [\ref=thm3] and Remark [\ref=rem1], it follows that almost all graphs have that tmc(G) = mc(G) + l(G) which implies that almost all graphs have that tmc(G) > mc(G). Thus, we propose the following conjecture.

For a connected graph G, it always holds that tmc(G) > mc(G).

Finally, we compare tmc(G) with mc(G) + mvc(G).

Let G be a connected graph. Then tmc(G)  ≤  mc(G) + mvc(G), and the equality holds if and only if G is a complete graph.

In order to prove Theorem [\ref=thm6], we need the following lemma.

For a noncomplete connected graph G, let f be a simple extremal TMC-coloring of G and [formula] denote all the nontrivial color trees of f, where ti = |V(Ti)| and qi = q(Ti) for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. Then, [formula].

Proof. For any v∈G, if [formula], v must be adjacent to an internal vertex w0 of a nontrivial color tree and then set [formula]. If v is an internal vertex of a nontrivial color tree containing v, set [formula]. Otherwise, v is a leaf of any nontrivial color tree containing v. Let [formula] denote the nontrivial color trees containing v and [formula] be the neighbors of v in [formula], respectively. Let [formula]. We obtain a spanning subgraph G' by deleting the edges of [formula]. Note that every vertex of [formula] is connected to each other. For any two vertices u1 and u2 of [formula], there exists a total monochromatic path P of G connecting them. For each vertex u of P, we have [formula]. Thus, G' also contains P from u1 to u2. Moreover, every vertex of [formula] is connected to a vertex of [formula]. Hence, G' is connected and each vertex of [formula] cannot be an internal vertex of G'. Then [formula].

Now, we are ready to prove Theorem [\ref=thm6].

Proof of Theorem 6: If G is a complete graph, we have that tmc(G) = mc(G) + mvc(G). Thus, suppose that G is not complete. We are given a simple extremal TMC-coloring f of G. Suppose that f consists of k nontrivial color trees denoted by [formula], where ti = |V(Ti)| and qi = q(Ti) for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. Then [formula]. Now we take a copy G' of G. Then G' contains the trees [formula] corresponding to [formula], respectively. Define an edge-coloring fe of G' as follows: color the edges of Ti with color i for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k and the other edges of G' with distinct new colors. Then fe is an MC-coloring of G' with [formula] colors. Thus, [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem5], we have that [formula]. Then tmc(G)  ≤  mc(G) + n - q(G) = mc(G) + l(G). Moreover, it is easy to obtain that mvc(G)  ≥  l(G) + 1. Hence, tmc(G) < mc(G) + mvc(G). Therefore, the proof is complete.

For the total rainbow connection number trc(G), we cannot bound one of trc(G) and rc(G) + rvc(G) in terms of the other. For a connected graph G, trc(G) = rc(G) + rvc(G) if G is a complete graph or a star. Moreover, if G is a complete bipartite graph Km,n with m  ≥  2 and n  ≥  6m, then trc(G) = 7 > rc(G) + rvc(G) = 4 + 1 [\cite=LiSS] [\cite=LMS] [\cite=LMS1]. In [\cite=LMS1], for every s  ≥  1481, there exists a graph G with trc(G) = rvc(G) = s which implies that trc(G) < rc(G) + rvc(G). This is one thing that the total monochromatic connection differs from the total rainbow connection.
