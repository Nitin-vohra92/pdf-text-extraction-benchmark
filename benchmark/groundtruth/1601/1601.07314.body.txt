KIC 8462852 did likely not fade during the last 100 years

Introduction

The F3 main-sequence star KIC8462852 was observed by the NASA Kepler mission from April 2009 to May 2013, and an analysis by [\citet=2015arXiv150903622B] shows unusual series of brightness dips up to 20%. This behavior has been theorized to originate from a family of large comets [\citep=2015arXiv151108821B], or signs of a Dyson sphere [\citep=2016ApJ...816...17W]. Subsequent analysis found no narrow-band radio signals [\citep=2015arXiv151101606H] and no periodic pulsed optical signals [\citep=2015arXiv151202388S] [\citep=2016arXiv160200987A]. The infrared flux is equally unremarkable [\citep=2015ApJ...815L..27L] [\citep=2015ApJ...814L..15M] [\citep=2015arXiv151203693T]. In order to better characterize the nature of KIC8462852, [\citet=2016arXiv160103256S] (in the following: S16) proposed examining the long-term archival photometry of the star by exmining records of the DASCH (Digital Access to a Sky Century Harvard) project [\citep=2009ASPC..410..101G] [\citep=2010AJ....140.1062L]. S16 claims to have found a "highly significant and highly confident secular dimming at an average rate of 0.165±  0.013 magnitudes per century", which is described as "completely unprecedented for any F-type main sequence star".

We have attempted to independently check the photometry described by S16, and to evaluate the claim of the dimming trend (section [\ref=sec:trend]), as well as the long-term accuracy of the data at hand (section [\ref=sec:longterm]). Afterwards, we compare our results to the literature (section [\ref=sec:lit]).

In-depth analysis of DASCH photometry for KIC8462852

From 1886 to 1992, the Harvard College Observatory observed large portions of the sky repeatedly, with the observations saved on over half a million photographic plates produced by different telescopes and observatories. The photographs constitute of glass plates with an emulsion most sensitive in the blue, which consitute the basis for the later Johnson B magnitude system [\citep=1953ApJ...117..313J]. The plates were digitized with a high speed scanner [\citep=2006SPIE.6312E..17S]. The initial photometry and astrometry are described in [\citet=2010AJ....140.1062L] and [\citet=2011ASPC..442..273S], and the current progress is summarized in [\citet=2013PASP..125..857T].

Retrieval of scanned photometry

The DASCH data are available online in multiple versions, each calibrated against a different set of absolute photometric standards. For KIC8462852, there are versions calibrated against the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC, [\citet=2011AJ....142..112B]), the Guide Star Catalog (GSC, [\citet=1990AJ.....99.2019L] [\citet=2008AJ....136..735L]), and the AAVSO Photometric All-Aky Survey (APASS, [\citet=2011SASS...30..121S] [\citet=2012JAVSO..40..430H]). We downloaded the data files for KIC8462852 based on each of the three calibrations, and following the procedures described by S16, selected all observations, excluding data from Yellow and Red plates.

Following §§2.1 in S16 we make the following additional cuts:

Identify and remove all values with quality flag indicator "AFLAGS"> 9000. There are 28 available flags, so the criterion removes 20 and keeps 8 flag types.

Remove all data values with one-sigma error bars > 0.33mag.

Remove all data values with the flux within 0.2 magnitudes of the quoted plate limit, with the limiting magnitude taken from the DASCH data as defined in [\citet=2013PASP..125..857T].

The results of these cuts for each of the three calibrations of the KIC8462852 light curve are listed in Table [\ref=tab:cleaning].

Since the light curve using the APASS calibration yields the largest number of useable observations, we will use this light curve for the analysis below unless noted otherwise.

Linear regressions

We test the DASCH light curve for normality [\citep=Shapiro], before and after the cleaning steps listed in section [\ref=subsec:scanned]. We find the light curve to deviate from a Gaussian distribution at very high significance. As is well known, error estimates in linear least-squares regressions are only valid for Gaussian distributions. Consequently, it is advised to use regression analytics that account for such a distribution.

For the original light curve (with 1953 observations), we fit a linear regression and use normal error estimates. Without binning, we obtain a slope of [formula] mag per century.

After cleaning the light curve, we fit a linear regression and get a formal slope of [formula] mag per century. As noted, these errors are incorrect due to non-normality.

To estimate errors in the non-Gaussian data, we can use a robust regression (e.g., [\citet=McKean2004]), which gives [formula] mag per century.

Finally, we can test the effect of 5-year bins as used in S16. With that modification, we find a slope of [formula] mag per century.

All regressions present significant slopes similar to that reported by S16.

Structural Breaks

After visual inspection of the data, we hypothesize that rather than a linear trend, there is actually a structural break in the light curve. We show the statistical evidence for that explanation in section [\ref=sec:break_statistics] and discuss it in section [\ref=subsec:whatif].

We suggest that this happened at the "Menzel Gap", a time of missing data in the 1960s [\citep=2012IAUS..285..243G]. The underlying cause for such a break could be that the time series is not a single, perfectly calibrated data stream. Instead, a total of 17 telescopes have contributed measurements to the DASCH archive for KIC8462852. As can be seen in Table [\ref=tab:telescopes] and in the left panel of Figure [\ref=fig_break], 16 of the 17 telescopes were active between 1889 and 1962. After 1962, all data come from the "Damons North Blue" telescope. We therefore hypothesize the underlying root cause of a structural break would be the use of different optical setup (camera, lens, coatings, plates, emulsions; geography, light-pollution, airmass, etc.) after 1962. Such differences might have cancelled out from combining 16 different telescopes in the time before 1962. Also, there is a considerable difference in limiting magnitude. According to DASCH, "Damons North Blue" used a 4.2 cm lens, with a limiting magnitude of 14.18. All other telescopes used for the KIC8462852 observations had an average limiting magnitude of 13.57. The different limiting magnitudes affect the quality cuts.

The only overlap of telescopes between the two potential segments occurs in the year 1962. Unfortunately, only three observations from the "3-inch Ross Fecker" and four observations from "Damons North Blue" overlap, all with large scatter. Formally, for that segment of time, we find [formula] for average magnitude of KIC8462852 from "Damons North Blue" and [formula] from the "3-inch Ross Fecker", so that the 1σ error bars nearly overlap.

We can employ statistical tests to check the confidence (if any) of a structural break at this point in time.

Structural break: Statistical results

We use the test from [\citet=Chow1960] to test the likelihood of a statistical break in the data. The Chow test splits the data in two segments and compares the compatibility of linear regressions in both.

For KIC8462852, the Chow test prefers the year 1962 for a split, coincident with the "Menzel gap". When splitting the data this way, a structural break is significant at 12σ confidence, and removes any linear trends in both parts (p=0.78 for the first part, p=0.31 for the second part). This is also visually evident from Figure [\ref=fig_break].

Partial data analysis

The Chow test raises a question about the observer's perspective. What if we performed the test at an earlier time, and only part of the dataset were available? The test should yield a consistent result, albeit with larger error bars. Using this method, we can ask the question: Would an observer in the year X also have found a linear trend with the then-available data? Or, contrary what data are required to produce a trend?

To investigate this question, we start with the complete light curve, and then repeatedly delete the newest observation, until the dimming becomes insignificant. We find that to find a significant dimming, one needs the data from 1889 through 1976.42 (at the 5% significance level), or 1889 through 1978.84 (at the 1% level). The light curve ends in 1989.89. In other words, for a researcher with only the data from 1889 to 1976 (or 1978) at hand, the star would have appeared constant within the errors. This is in contrast to a continous linear trend, which should be significant even for a third of the dataset. Therefore, we argue it is more likely that a sudden jump in apparent luminosity occurred, rather than a linear trend.

Comparing similar stars

We also compare these results with stars similar to KIC8462852. We selected from the Kepler Input Catalog stars within three degrees of KIC8462852, with Kepler magnitude 11.5 < KP < 12.2, surface gravity 3.8 < log g < 4.2 (dwarfs) and temperature 6700 < Teff < 6900 (F-stars) to match the general properties of KIC8462852. We also checked the stars are constant during the 4.25 years of Kepler observations, with amplitudes (e.g. due to rotation) < 1% and trends < 0.1%. We obtained APASS colors of these stars, and selected only those with 11.5 < B < 12.5 and 0.4 < B - V < 0.7.

This selection yields 294 stars. We then extract the light curves of these stars from DASCH. Retrieving the DASCH data is a slow, manual process, so we limited our analysis to the first 50 stars closest to KIC8462852. For 41 of these, data from DASCH were available.

We remove red and yellow plates, and apply the data quality cuts listed in section [\ref=subsec:scanned]. We show two examples of stars with significant slopes in Figure [\ref=fig:KIC6366512]. The left panel presents KIC6366512 (B= 11.8mag, B - V = 0.3). This star is constant within 0.2% rms during the 4.25 years of Kepler observations. In the DASCH data, it shows a brightening trend of [formula]mag per century (or a structural break at very high significance). We stress that this trend persists, and the figure remains essentially unchanged, if all flagged data are rejected.

A second example is shown in the right panel of Figure [\ref=fig:KIC6366512] for KIC9909362, this time in the APASS calibration. KIC9909362 is a constant F-star with B= 12.2mag, B - V = 0.7, very similar to KIC8462852. We performed the same data cleansing and find a dimming trend with slope [formula]mag per century.

The slopes for all 41 stars in this selection is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:dist] (left). We also split the light cuves for each star at the year 1962 and calculate the mean for each segment (Figure [\ref=fig:dist], right). The error bars are the added uncertainties of both segments. The plots show KIC8462852 is placed towards the end of the distribution (i.e. its slope/break is relatively high), with comparably low error bars. Still, 4 of 41 comparison stars have higher absolute slopes, and 5 of 41 have higher absolute structural breaks. Therefore, KIC8462852 does not appear to be extraordinary by these measures. Instead, it is within the range of linear trands and structural breaks for normal Harvard DASCH photometry.

Comparing different stars

As an additional check, we have repeated a similar analysis for the KIC calibration of the DASCH data (noting that the previous analysis was performed on the APASS calibration for all stars). This time, we select a wider range of g-band magnitudes (9 < g < 14) to explore a potential correlation between brightness and long-term slope. From the Kepler Input Catalog, we select the stars most similar to KIC8462852 by requiring the temperature to be within 100K (6484 < Teff < 6684), the stellar radius within 5% ([formula]), and log g within 10% (3.712 < log g < 4.536). We performed the usual data cleansing described in S16. We removed a few stars that have less than 10 DASCH observations to avoid very large error bars. The result in Figure [\ref=fig:lund] (left panel) shows the slopes. The results are virtually identical with, or without removal of red and yellow plates. Again, we do not find that KIC8462852 has an outlier slope that indicates that it is unique. The same applies to the differences in mean magnitude before and after 1962 (Figure [\ref=fig:lund], right panel). A follow-up study (Lund 2016, in prep.) will analyze a wider parameter space to sharpen our understanding of low-level systematics in DASCH photometry.

Long-term accuracy of DASCH photometry

It must be noted that the digitization of the Harvard Astronomical Plate Collection is an extraordinarily important project. The long-term light curves are and will be invaluable for comparison with data from ongoing missions such as K2, and upcoming space-based photometry missions such as TESS and PLATO, as the long time baseline of DASCH reference gives leverage in time like no other data set. Great efforts have been made by the DASCH team to digitize and calibrate the glass plates. The volume and the quality achieved is nothing short of impressive. As of 02 February 2016, 136,949 plates have been scanned; and 8,540,081,000 magnitudes have been measured. This work is unprecedented and of the greatest importance for the astrophysical community.

The long-term photometric calibration is described by the DASCH team to have an accuracy of ~    ±  0.1mag per century. A best case example is shown on the DASCH website, together with the description: "For quality control purposes we are also interested in stars that do NOT vary. Such constant-brightness stars enable sensitive determination of various systematic effects and provide a completely independent measure of uncertainties. At left is the lightcurve of such a star demonstrating about +/-0.1mag photometry over 600 plates, that span 100 years and 19 different plate-series." (their emphasis). A very similar example, with the same accuracy over a century, is given in the original DASCH calibration paper ([\citet=2010AJ....140.1062L], their Figure 15 and caption).

This judgment regarding the level of long-term accuracy is similar to the one found by [\citet=2013PASP..125..857T] (0.1mag) and [\citet=2013PASP..125..793T] who checked 997 Kepler planet host stars and found that "Our typical photometric uncertainty is ̃0.1-0.15 mag". In their Figure 3 in [\citet=2013PASP..125..793T], they present the uncertainty as a function of magnitude, indicating an rms of 0.2mag at 2σ for KP=12mag. In their Figure 1 in the same paper, a decade-long bump is apparent for the Kepler planet host star KIC8191672, although it is unclear whether this trend is of an instrumental or astrophysical nature.

Lastly, there is a paper by the DASCH core team, analyzing "KU Cyg, a 5 year accretion event in 1900" [\citep=2011ApJ...738....7T]. They state that, for the star KU Cyg, "There seems to be a slight trend of 0.1-0.2mag brightening from 1910 to 1990; however, given our systematic uncertainty over 100 years of ~  0.1 mag (S. Tang et al. 2011, in preparation), it is not convincing."

A trend on the 0.1mag level is therefore not extraordinary, and can be said to be within the normal fluctuation of post-calibrated Harvard plate data.

It must be noted that despite these limits to long-term calibration at the 0.1 - 0.2mag level, the DASCH data is still invaluable for many fields, such as GRBs [\citep=2013AcPol..53c..27H], RR Lyrae [\citep=2015OEJV..173....1L], LBVs [\citep=2015A&A...581A..12B] [\citep=2014ATel.6295....1W], AGN flares [\citep=2015AAS...22532003G], stellar activity cycles [\citep=2014CoSka..43..411O], novae [\citep=2012ApJ...751...99T], dust accretion events [\citep=2011ApJ...738....7T], long-peripd eclipsing binary systems [\citep=2016arXiv160100135R], or long-term amplitudes in K giants [\citep=2010ApJ...710L..77T]. These are processes that happen on scales of magnitudes, and not fractions of a magnitude.

Cross-checking SuperWASP data

As noted by [\citet=2015arXiv150903622B], KIC8462852 was observed by SuperWASP for 3 seasons. The first season, which includes only 22 observations, shows a 0.2mag offset, which is also seen for the check stars in S16. Therefore, we discard the first season (dropping 22 of 5351 total data points) and examine only seasons 2 and 3. As can be seen in Figure [\ref=fig_superwasp], KIC8462852 as well as the two check stars show constant luminosity within the errors. Due to the large number of observations, we can determine precise (nomimal) values for the average of both seasons separately. For KIC8462852, we get [formula]mag for the first season, and [formula]mag for the second season, which is a brightening of [formula]mag. In other words, constant luminosity within the errors. The same is true for the two check stars. However, the systematic errors in the SuperWASP data are clearly larger than the formal errors. We find an average formal error for KIC8462852 of 0.00054mag (excluding the first season), but the RMS of the magnitudes is 0.017mag.

If a linear dimming trend was present, we would expect a luminosity decrease. As the two seasons are separated by an average of 377 days, luminosity would have to been decreased by 0.00170mag (based on the purported dimming trend of 0.165±  0.013 magnitudes per century in S16). As our systematic errors are larger than the theoretical dimming for this period, we cannot exclude (or confirm) a dimming trend.

Literature comparison of our results

Linear trend in S16

S16 claims a dimming of [formula] magnitudes per century for KIC8462852. In this section, we compare those claims with the results of our analysis.

S16 does not mention which calibration was used, or which search radius for the allowed astrometric deviation between scanned source position and catalogue position, but does mention that after performing the data cleansing, "I have 1232 magnitudes from DASCH". As described in section [\ref=subsec:scanned], we find 699 values (KIC calibration), 1386 (APASS,) or 679 (GSC). The origin of the differences between our DASCH light curve for KIC8462852 and the one used by S16 is unclear. One possible origin is the selection of which astrometric deviation between the measured (scanned) source and nominal (catalogue) position is considered acceptable. The DASCH server allows for values between 1 and 60 arc seconds, with a default value of 5 arc seconds. Changing this value changes the number of resulting observations.

When performing a linear regression with the 1386 cleaned APASS values, we find a formal [formula]mag per century (section [\ref=subsec:regressions]), consistent with S16. When accounting for non-normality, this changes only slightly. We have not attempted to try further binning choices, such as 1-year bins, 2.5-years bins, 5-year bins etc. as we do not believe this adds any value to the analysis.

By-eye measurements in S16

S16 performed manual ("by-eye") brightness estimates using a method described in [\citet=1981PASP...93..253S] with a 10×   loupe, for 131 of 1581 data points.

These "by-eye" measurements have neither been publicly released nor been shown in the study, so that we cannot compare the results. The results seem to be different, because a linear fit "yields a slope of [formula] magnitudes per century", which is described as "formally different from the slope that I get from DASCH". In fact, this trend has almost twice (1.88×  , 5σ confidence of differing) the slope of the scanned data.

Comparing the check stars in S16

The dimming trend mentioned in S16 was compared to check stars. The author "used the same procedures and selections to produce DASCH light curves for five nearby stars with similar magnitudes" and found "that check stars have constant light curves to a level of 0.03 mag over a full hundred years." The paper reveals, however, only the identities of two of the check stars. We re-examined these.

For TYC 3162-879-1 (KIC8462775), we pulled the data from DASCH for the KIC and the APASS calibration. We found no trend, and no structural break, within the errors of 0.02mag per century.

For TYC 3162-1001-1 (KIC8398290) we tried the same. The KIC calibration, uncleaned and unbinned, results in a brightening trend of -0.07±  0.01mag per century. After data cleansing as described in S16, we obtain 1002 data points and a formal slope of -0.05±  0.01mag per century. This is slightly larger than the 0.03 mag found in S16, and formally highly significant. As discussed in section [\ref=sec:longterm], we believe that all these formally significant trends are overshadowed by long-term systematics.

Also, the slope of TYC 3162-1001-1 is ~  50% of the one we find for KIC8462852 ([formula]mag per century, section [\ref=subsec:regressions]). This means that the check stars revealed in S16 do indeed fluctuate less than KIC8398290, but one of the two also shows evidence for systematics in the data.

Discussion and next steps

Issues in defining quality cuts

There is the problem of human bias that does affect the selection of acceptable criteria for a comparison. Assume that some researcher analyzed photometry of KIC8462852, and found a slope of 0.165 mag per century. One could now define criteria for quality cuts, so that the trend in KIC8462852 persists, but trends in most other stars vanish. Clearly, quality cuts (if any!) must be defined completely independently. Then, a large number (thousands) of constant stars must be processed consistently and automatically. Afterwards, the distribution of slopes can be used to assess the significance of a slope of 0.165 mag per century. A similar approach is used for the removal of instrumental systematics from the Kepler light curves, dubbed "Cotrending Basis Vectors" [\citep=2012PASP..124.1000S].

The use (or rejection) of red and yellow plates is relevant. A literature review shows that all publications accessible for us (except S16) do use these data (e.g., [\citet=2010AJ....140.1062L] [\citet=2013PASP..125..857T] [\citet=2013PASP..125..793T] [\citet=2015OEJV..173....1L]). Indeed, the DASCH team itself does this in their publications, and simply mentions the plates "are mostly blue sensitive" [\citep=2011ApJ...738....7T]. It is preferable to keep all available data (that are not amongst a few multi-σ outliers), and propagate their large(r) error bars accordingly. Indeed, these values are also classified as "Johnson B magnitude" data and have been calibrated by the DASCH team.

Plate selection aside, other quality cuts are done equally arbitrary in the literature. In [\citet=2013PASP..125..793T], for example, the authors analyzed 997 Kepler stars and included all plates (also the red and yellow ones), but defined their own series of quality cuts. These include blended images, "measurements within 0.75 mag of the limiting magnitude" (in contrast to S16, who set a limit of 0.2mag), "images within the outer border of the plates whose width is 10%" (which was accepted in S16), and more. Unfortunately, these criteria are also not precisely defined, e.g. the rejection of "Stars with strong correlation between magnitude measurements and plate limiting magnitudes", so that the results are also not reproducible.

A last issue worth mentioning is astrometric precision. The DASCH website selects data values depending on the distance between detection and catalogue position; the selectable range is 1 - 60 arcsec, with a default of 5 arcsec. We found no reference in the literature discussing the best choice.

Cross-checking Sonneberg plates

The second largest plate archive in the world, after Harvard, is located at Sonneberg Observatory, Germany [\citep=Brauer1992]. It was continuously active from the 1930s until today, in a very homogeneous manner, using the same optics and very similar plate scales, sizes and emulsions for many decades. The archive contains > 275,000 plates covering the entire northern and equatorial sky (down to declination [formula]), without any major gaps. Since 1993, the complete archive was digitized [\citet=1993A&A...273..341K] [\citet=2004A&A...428..925V]. For KIC8462852, [formula] plates exist as scanned bitmaps ([formula] in B, [formula] in V, and other sensitivities). We plan to report an analysis of these data in a forthcoming paper.

Conclusion

We have re-analyzed time-series photometry from the Harvard plates and find a photometric sensitivity limit of [formula]mag per century, which is an extraordinary achievement for a historical archive like this, and confirms the number given in other DASCH studies (e.g., [\citet=2010AJ....140.1062L] [\citet=2011ApJ...738....7T] [\citet=2013PASP..125..857T] [\citet=2013PASP..125..793T]). However, we conclude systematics and heterogeneity of the data make it extremely challenging to derive photometric trends at that level. The slope (or structural break) of this star is not notably greater (< 1.7σ among all samples) when compared to > 500 twin stars. It is quite possible an astrophyiscal phenomenon is in fact present, resulting in either a structural break of brightness, or in a linear trend. Yet, with the data at hand, we must attribute the variation to be most likely of instrumental origin. The suggestion of [\citet=2016ApJ...816...17W] that the secular dimming of a star may represent the signature of technological structures orbiting a star is an interesting one that may yet be identified in another system. Assuming no long-term dimming is present, the puzzling day-long dips in KIC8462852 might indeed be the result of a family of large comets [\citep=2015arXiv151108821B].
