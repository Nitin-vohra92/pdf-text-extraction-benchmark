Spiral waves triggered by shadows in transition disks

Introduction

During the last decade optical-infrared direct imaging of circumstellar disks has revealed spiral patterns around some HAeBe stars. These spirals are seen in intermediate mass stars, ~  2 M[formula], with an inner cavity in a gas-rich disk, and are loosely classified as transition disks [\citep=Espaillat2012]. Outstanding examples are AB Aur [\citep=Grady1999ApJ...523L.151G] [\citep=Fukagawa2004ApJ...605L..53F], HD 100546 [\citep=Grady2001AJ....122.3396G] [\citep=Boccaletti2013AA...560A..20B], HD 142527 [\citep=Fukagawa2006] [\citep=Casassus2012ApJ...754L..31C], MWC 758 [\citep=Grady2013ApJ...762...48G] [\citep=Benisty2015AA...578L...6B], HD 135344B [\citep=Muto2012ApJ...748L..22M] [\citep=Garufi2013AA...560A.105G] [\citep=Wahhaj2015AA...581A..24W], and HD 100453 [\citep=Wagner2015ApJ...813L...2W]. Spirals usually stem away from the outer rims of disk cavities, with large pitch angles [\citep=Dong-2015a]. They can extend from ~  15 AU to 600 AU from the central star [\citep=Clampin2003AJ....126..385C] [\citep=Christiaens-2014] and some of them show remarkable m = 2 azimuthal symmetry [\citep=Dong-2015a].

The origin of such spirals is motivating intense research efforts. Spiral density waves can be launched by unseen substellar companions of [formula] [\citep=Muto-2012]. [\cite=Juhasz-2015] studied the observability of spirals launched by embedded planets, suggesting that they are the result of changes in the vertical scale height of the disk rather than density perturbations [\citep=pohl-2015]. Interestingly, the large pitch angles in spirals with m = 2 symmetry can be explained by the presence of massive planets exterior to the spiral features [\citep=Dong-2015a]. An origin in gravitational instabilities is also plausible for massive disks, but limits the size of the spirals to [formula]100 AU [\citep=Lodato-Rice-2004] [\citep=Dong-2015]. Thus current spiral models require either massive planets, or gravitationally unstable disks, or both [\citep=pohl-2015].

Motivated by the recent identification of deep shadows cast by an inner warp in HD 142527 [\citep=Marino-et-al-2015] [\citep=Casassus2015ApJ...811...92C], in this letter we consider the dynamical consequences of the temperature forcing on the outer disk as it periodically flows under such shadows. We use 2D hydro simulations to follow the evolution of a passive gaseous disk subjected to non-axially symmetric shadowing, and report on the development of spiral waves (Sec. [\ref=model]). Based on these results (Sec. [\ref=results]), we propose an alternative mechanism to trigger spirals from illumination effects in the outer regions of gapped systems (Sec. [\ref=conclusions]).

The Model

We are interested in the evolution of a self-gravitating, planetless, gaseous circumstellar passive disk. The stellar radiation field is fixed to two reference values, [formula], and [formula]. We consider disks with masses Md  =  0.05, and [formula], without including viscous dissipation, which translates into very low accretion rates. A constant kinematic viscosity prescription is used, given by ν  =  4.5  ×  107m2  ~  s- 1. The evolution of the disk is followed for about 104 years.

The model features two point-symmetric shadows projected along the disk with opening angles [formula]. This value is motivated by HD 142527's case reported by [\citet=Marino-et-al-2015]. In general, any tilted thick inner disk will cast point-symmetric shadows onto the outer disk [\citep=Whitney2013].

The simulations were performed with the public two-dimensional hydrodynamic code fargo-adsg [\citep=Baruteau-Masset-2008], after implementing a non-stationary energy equation that includes a blackbody radiative cooling. The code solves the Navier-Stokes, continuity and energy equations on a staggered mesh in polar coordinates (r,φ). For detailed description of the code see [\cite=Masset-2000] and [\cite=Baruteau-Masset-2008].

Code units and initial setup

The used code units assume the central star mass, [formula], and the inner rim border, r0  =  1 AU, as the units of mass and length. The code unit of time, t0, corresponds to the orbital period at r0 divided by 2π, that is [formula]. The gravitational constant is G = 1 in code units. The temperature unit is [formula], with μ being the mean molecular weight (μ  =  2.35 in all our simulations), mp the proton mass and kB the Boltzmann constant. We adopt two values for the disk-to-star mass ratio, q  =  0.25 and 0.05.

The computational domain in physical units extends from r  =  10 to 150 AU over nr  =  400 logarithmically spaced radial cells. The grid samples 2π in azimuth with nφ  =  800 equally spaced sectors. Gas material is allowed to outflow at the disk edges.

The initial density profile scales with r- 1:

[formula]

where the value of Σ0 is set by fixing the disk mass to 0.05 and 0.25 [formula] ([formula]). The disk initial aspect ratio, H / r, is fixed to 0.05. All models include self-gravity. Our choice of parameters is similar to other numerical models of transition disks [\citep=Dipierro-2015].

Shadows modeling

The stellar irradiation heating per unit area is given by [\citep=Frohlich-2003]:

[formula]

where β  =  0.1 is a reflection factor (albedo) and φ is the angle formed between the incident radiation and the normal to the surface, given by [formula]. The disk scale height is assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, i.e., H  =  r ~ cs(T) / vk, with cs(T) the sound speed and vk the Keplerian velocity. [formula] is the stellar luminosity.

In our simulations, shadows are cast by an inner region (inside the computational domain) which blocks a fraction of the stellar irradiation [formula] within an angle δ. The irradiation heating per unit area, including shadows projected onto the disk, Q+d(r,φ), reads;

[formula]

Obscured and illuminated regions are connected by a smooth azimuthal function f(φ)  =  1  -  A exp (  -  φ4   /   σ2)  -  A exp (  -  (φ   -   π)4   /   σ2), with A = 0.999 and σ  =  δ / 10. [formula] is given by Equation [\ref=Qstar]. The time-dependent function F(t) is a shadow-tapering factor which gradually enables the shadows over a timescale of 30 orbits. Figure [\ref=Qplus] shows the stellar irradiation prescription described by Equation [\ref=QstarFinal].

The energy equation

The equation for the thermal energy density, e, reads (e.g., [\cite=D'Angelo-2003]):

[formula]

where [formula] is the gas velocity, P the pressure, and Q+d the stellar heating rate per unit area described by Eq. [\ref=QstarFinal]. We implemented a radiative cooling per unit area function, Q-  =  2σT4  /  τ, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzman constant and τ the optical depth given by [formula]. A constant opacity given by an effective κ  =  130 ~ cm2  ~  g- 1. For more details about this prescription, see [\cite=2015ApJ...806..253Montesinos].

To close the system of equations, an ideal equation of state is used,

[formula]

where T is the mid-plane gas temperature and [formula] is the gas constant. The thermal energy density is related to the temperature through

[formula]

where the adiabatic index is fixed to the diatomic gas value γ  =  1.4.

Results

Spiral structures in the density field

Control simulations without shadows were performed in order to test for azimuthal structures unrelated to illumination effects. Additionally, random noise at the ~  0.1% level was injected to the initial surface density of these simulations in order to test for stability and fragmentation.

Azimuthal features due solely to the disk self-gravity develop in control runs with [formula] and [formula], on timescales of [formula] orbits. This is expected for such gravitationally unstable disks [\citep=Dipierro-2015]. For control models with [formula] (gravitationally stable), no spiral structures emerge, independent of the strength of the stellar irradiation field.

When shadows are enabled, spiral-like structures emerge in the surface density of a simulated 0.05 M[formula] disk irradiated by a [formula] star. The onset of these structures occurs approximately after 130 orbital periods. On the other hand, no spirals appear if the 0.05 [formula] disk is illuminated by only [formula].

We consider the onset of the shadow-induced spirals to be the time at which their scale height suffices δH / H≃0.3. This criterion is evaluated within 10 AU from the disk inner radius. The perturbation on the scale height is calculated as [formula], where H0 represents the background scale height without shadows. We note that a relative change of ~  0.2 in scale height is sufficient to produce detectable azimuthal signatures in scattered light predictions [\citep=Juhasz-2015] [\citep=Dong-2015a].

For the more massive 0.25 M[formula] disk, with [formula], the first non-axisymetric structures appear approximately after 2500 orbits. For the same disk mass, but increasing stellar irradiation to 100 L[formula], the first spirals arise shortly after only 150 orbits. These different timescales will be discussed in the next subsection.

Figure [\ref=Dens1] shows the impact of different stellar irradiation values on the evolution of the density field, for a 0.25 M[formula] disk. Top row shows the 100 L[formula] model after 150, 250, and 400 orbits (from left to right, respectively), while bottom panels show the 1 L[formula] model at 2500, 3500, and 4000 orbits (from left to right). Each first snapshot corresponds to the moment spirals appear for the first time, as defined above. The rightest top and bottom panels correspond to control runs, in which no shadows are present.

Pitch angle

Spiral arm's pitch angles were computed by fitting the spirals with an Archimedean equation r(φ)  =  A0  +  A1φn. The pitch angle Π is then obtained through tan Π  =  (1 / r)dr / dφ. From this parameterized curve, a global pitch angle is calculated as the mean value along the curve.

Π varies over time for different model parameters. The shadow-induced spiral arms extend from A0 (~  60-90 AU, see Table[\ref=spiral_table]) to the outer region of the disk ~  150 AU (see Figure [\ref=Dens1]), as opposed to spirals resulting from gravitational instabilities which persist over scales [formula] AU [\citep=Dong-2015a]. Table [\ref=spiral_table] summarizes the most important features of the shadow-induced spirals.

Formation of spiral-like structures from shadows

Perturbations in a differentially rotating gaseous disk tend to wind up into spiral patterns (e.g., see the control model, bottom-rightest panel in Figure [\ref=Dens1]). In our models, projected shadows act as forcing perturbations, which efficiently and independently of the presence of random source of symmetry breaking (e.g., gravitational instabilities), produce spirals. Because of the point-symmetric nature of this perturbation, density waves are excited with m = 2 morphology. Each shadow appears to trigger one spiral arm.

Shortly after the shadows have been cast onto the disk, and before the disk thermalizes, the gas pressure (Eq. [\ref=state1]) plummets at the shadowed regions. Figure [\ref=grad] (left panel) shows the relative change in pressure (P  -  P0)  /  P0, where P0 is the background unshadowed gas pressure. This snapshot corresponds to a 100 L[formula] and [formula] model disk immediately after shadows are enabled. Figure [\ref=grad] shows the azimuthal pressure acceleration, [formula], after 30 orbits for two [formula] disk models with [formula] and [formula], middle and right panels, respectively. The pressure acceleration magnitude increases with stellar irradiation: the maximum value for the pressure acceleration increases from 0.2 to 24  ~  cm  ~  s- 2 when the stellar irradiation passes from [formula] (middle) to [formula] (right panel).

As the gas in the disk flows around the star (in anticlockwise direction for all figures), it periodically enters and exits shadowed regions. At the interfaces between shadowed and fully illuminated sections, the gas is subjected to an azimuthal acceleration due to pressure gradients (i.e., [formula]). As the gas enters a shadowed region (coming from high to low pressure), it experiences a positive azimuthal acceleration (anticlockwise). On the other hand, as it exits the shadow (moving from low to high pressure), the gas experiences a negative azimuthal acceleration (clockwise). The difference between the gain and loss of azimuthal acceleration is uneven, resulting in a net azimuthal acceleration in the anticlockwise direction (gas rotation direction), which varies with radius within the first ~  50 AU. This creates a strong source of axisymmetry breaking, locally pushing the gas to move faster around the central star at the inner regions of the disk, piling up material which then leads to the formation of spiral-like structures outspread by differential rotation.

Gas pressure acceleration depends on stellar luminosity as more luminous stars feed more energy into their disks, rising the temperature of the illuminated sections while leaving the shadowed region unaffected. This produces a higher contrasts in the pressure field. This is the reason why spirals appear early (~  130 orbits) in models with [formula], when compared to 1 L[formula] models in which the first spirals emerge only after ~  2500 orbits. The key factor is the contrast in pressure between dark and illuminated regions.

Gravitational instabilities

Gravitational instabilities can be locally characterized by the Toomre parameter given by [formula], where cs, Ω, and Σ correspond to sound speed, angular velocity and surface density, respectively [\citep=Toomre-1964]. The disk becomes unstable when Q  <  Qcrit, where Qcrit defines the range for which a disk is marginally unstable: [formula].

According to the local Toomre parameter, denser and colder regions of the disk tend to have lower Q values. The [formula] and [formula] model is stable everywhere in the disk, with a minimum Q value of 3.35. The most unstable model ([formula] and [formula] attains a minimum local value Q = 0.5. It is important to remark that spiral structures emerge even if we disable self-gravity from our simulations. The shadow-induced spirals do not require the presence of gravitational instabilities for their development.

Radiative transfer

We input our simulations into a 3D radiative transfer code to produce scattered light predictions in H-band (1.6μm). We used the RADMC3D code (version 0.39), assuming that the dust follows the same density field as the gas in the simulation, with a gas-to-dust ratio of 100. The dust distribution model consists of a mix of two common species: amorphous carbon and astronomical silicates. We used Mie theory (homogeneous spheres) to compute dust opacities for anisotropic scattering. The optical constants for amorphous carbon (intrinsic grain densities 2 g cm- 3) were taken from [\cite=Li-Greenberg-1997], and for silicates (intrinsic grain densities 4 g cm- 3) from [\cite=Draine-Lee-1984].

To produce a 3D volume, the vertical density structure was solved assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. The disk scale height is obtained from the temperature field (Section [\ref=shadow_modeling]). The temperature in the vertical direction is assumed to be constant and equal to the midplane temperature with Tgas  =  Tdust. The final image prediction is rendered using a second order volume ray-tracing.

Figure [\ref=radmc] shows a model prediction based on a 0.25 M[formula] disk with stellar irradiation of 1 L[formula], after it had evolved for 3500 orbits. We recover the spiral arms in scattered light. We also obtain observable spiral structures in L-band. The scattered light spirals follow the same equation as the one obtained from the density field, i.e., [formula] (see Figure [\ref=Dens1], bottom row, orbit 3500, and/or Table [\ref=spiral_table]).

Concluding remarks

We investigated the hydrodynamical consequences of illumination effects in transitional disks, such as shadows cast onto a circumstellar disk, focusing on the development of spiral structures. The evolution of a passive disk was calculated using 2D hydro-simulations including stellar irradiation values of 1 and 100 [formula], and with two point-symmetric shadows cast within an opening angle of 28[formula], for disk masses of Md  =  0.05 and Md  =  0.25 M[formula]. Pressure gradients due to temperature differences between obscured and illuminated regions induce spiral structures in the density field. These spirals emerge independent of whether self-gravity is enabled or not. The structures observed in the density field can be characterized by an Archimedean spiral which attain nearly constant pitch angles ~  11[formula]-14[formula], and extend from ~  60 AU to the outer disk rim. Radiative transfer calculations, for a model with [formula] disk mass and stellar irradiation of [formula], predict that these shadow-induced spirals should be detectable in H-band scattered light images.

Recently, [\cite=Rafikov2016] presented an analytical study of the effect of density waves on proto-planetary disks. They found that density waves with contrast of order unity, such as the ones resulting from our models, produce an enhancement in the accretion rate that could explain the large cavities observed in some transition disks. In HD 142527, the inner disk casts a shadow that explains the observed dips in the outer disk [\citep=Marino-et-al-2015], and, as shown in this letter, drives spiral waves [\citep=Casassus-et-al-2012] [\citep=Christiaens-2014]. Following [\cite=Rafikov2016], the enhanced accretion produced by these spirals could have depleted the inner ~  100 AU of this disk. The HD 100453 disk [\citep=Wagner2015ApJ...813L...2W], which we suggest bears strong similarities to HD 142527 as spirals are seen to stem away from dark regions in the outer disk, might also fit in this scenario. A more detailed study of the interplay between the different processes will be investigated in a follow-up paper.
