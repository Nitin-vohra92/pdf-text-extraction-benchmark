Salem numbers and Enriques surfaces

Introduction

Let X be a smooth algebraic surface over an algebraically closed field [formula] and [formula] be the numerical lattice of X, the quotient of the Picard group [formula] modulo numerical equivalence. An automorphism f of X acts on [formula] preserving the inner product defined by the intersection product on [formula]. It is known that the characteristic polynomial of [formula] is the product of cyclotomic polynomials and at most one Salem polynomial, a monic irreducible reciprocal polynomial in [formula] which has two reciprocal positive roots and all other roots are complex numbers of absolute value equal to one (see [\cite=McMul1]).

The spectral radius λf of f*, i.e. the eigenvalue of f* on [formula] with maximal absolute value, is equal to 1 or the real eigenvalue larger than 1. The number λf is called the dynamical degree of f. It expresses the growth of the degrees of iterates fn of f. More precisely, we have [\cite=Cantat]

[formula]

where deg hfn  =  ((f*)n(h),h) is the degree of fn with respect to the numerical class of an ample divisor on X. The dynamical degree of f does not depend on h.

An automorphism f is called hyperbolic if λf  >  1. Equivalently, in the action of f* on the hyperbolic space associated with the real Minkowski space [formula], f* is a hyperbolic isometry. Its two fixed points on the boundary correspond to the eigenvector of f* with eigenvalues λf and 1 / λf. The isometry f* acts on a geodesic with ends at the fixed points as a hyperbolic translation with the hyperbolic distance λf. It is known that log λf is equal to the topological entropy of f* acting in the hyperbolic space (see the explanation in [\cite=Oguiso]).

If λf  =  1, then the isometry f* is elliptic or parabolic. In the first case f is an automorphism with some power lying in the connected component of the identity of the automorphism group of X. In this case deg hfn is bounded. In the second case deg hfn grows linearly and f preserves a genus one fibration on X (see [\cite=Gizatullin]).

Going through the classification of algebraic surface, one easily checks that a hyperbolic automorphism can be realized only on abelian, K3, Enriques, or rational surfaces.

The smallest known Selmer number is the Lehmer number [formula] with the minimal equation

[formula]

It is equal to 1.17628.... It is conjectured that this is indeed the smallest Salem number. The conjecture is verified for the degrees of Salem polynomials less than or equal than 40.

The Lehmer number can be realized as the dynamical degree of an automorphism of a rational surface or a K3 surface (see [\cite=McMul3], [\cite=McMul4]). On the other hand it is known that it cannot be realized on an Enriques surface [\cite=Oguiso].

In this paper we atempt to construct hyperbolic automorphisms of Enriques surfaces of small as possible dynamical degree. We have no proof that our examples are optimal, so the paper should be viewed as a computer experiment.

The main idea for the search of hyperbolic automorphisms of small dynamical degree is based on the following nice result of Junyi Xi [\cite=Xie] that roughly says that the dynamical degree of an automorphism can be only made smaller then the surface together with the automorphism is specialized in an algebraic family. More precisely, we have the following theorem.

Let π:X  →  S be a smooth projective family of surfaces over an integral scheme S, and f be an automorphism of X / S. Let U  ⊂  S be subset of s∈S such that fs: = f|Xs is an automorphism. Then the function φ:s  ↦  λ(fs) is lower semi-continuous (i.e. for any real number r, the set s∈U:φ(s)  ≤  r is closed).

One can use this result, for example, when π is a family of lattice polarized K3 surfaces. We use this result in the case of a family of Enriques surfaces when a general fiber has no smooth rational curves and the special fibers acquire them. In a more sophisticated terms, we show that the dynamical degree of an automorphism depends on the Nukulin nodal invariant of the surface.

Let [formula] be the Enriques lattice, the even unimodular hyperbolic lattice of rank 10. It is realized as the orthogonal complement of the canonical class of the blow-up of 10 points in the plane. One can check that the Lehmer number is the eigenvalue of the Coxeter element of the group with the Coxeter diagram T2,3,7 for which E10 is the root lattice. Curt McMullen had realized the Coxeter element as a birational transformation of the plane by taking the 10 points some special points on an irreducible cuspidal cubic [\cite=McMul3]. This element lifts to a biregular automorphism of the rational surface X obtained by blowing up these ten points. Later he realized the Lehmer number as a Salem number of an automorphism of a K3 surface [\cite=McMul4]. On the other hand, according to K. Oguiso [\cite=Oguiso], one cannot realize the Lehmer number on an Enriques surface.

My goal of experiments which I will describe in the following sections is to realize small Selmer numbers on Enriques surfaces with a larger automorphism group and also to give experimental evidence to Xie's result.

This paper owes much to the conversations with Paul Reschke whose joint work with Bar Roytman makes a similar experiment with automorphisms of K3 surfaces isomorphic to a hypersurface in the produt [formula]. I also grateful to Keiji Oguiso and Xun Yu for useful remarks on my talk on this topic during the "Conference on K3 surfaces and related topics" held in Seoul on November 16-20, 2015. I am thankful to JongHae Keum and Shigeyuki Kondo for the invitation.

Specializations of automorphisms of a general Enriques surface

Let S be an Enriques surface. Let us remind some known facts about Enriques surfaces which can be found in many sources (e.g. [\cite=Dolgachev1] and references there). It is known that [formula] is an even unimodular lattice of signature (1,9), and, as such, it is isomorphic to the lattice E10 equal to the orthogonal sum of the negative definite unimodular lattice E8 of rank 8 and the unimodular even rank 2 lattice U. One can choose a basis [formula] in [formula] formed by isotropic vectors [formula] and a vector δ with

[formula]

Together with the vector

[formula]

the ordered set [formula] form a 10-sequence of isotropic vectors with (fi,fj)  =  1,i  ≠  j. We say that the isotropic sequence [formula] is non-degenerate, if each fi is equal to the numerical class of a nef divisor Fi. In this case δ is the numerical class of a nef divisor Δ. The linear system |Δ| defines a birational morphisms onto a normal surface of degree 10 in [formula], called a Fano model of S.

We have [formula], so there are two choices for Fi if KS  ≠  0 and one choice if KS  =  0 (the latter may happen only if the characteristic [formula] of [formula] is equal 2). The linear system |2Fi| defines a genus one fibration [formula] on S, an elliptic fibration if [formula]. The fibers 2Fi are its double fibers, the other double fiber is 2Fi', where Fi'∈|Fi + KS|.

The linear system |2Fi + 2Fj| defines a degree 2 morphism from S onto a quartic del Pezzo surface D. If p  ≠  2, it has 4 nodes and it is isomorphic to the quotient of [formula] by an involution with 4 isolated fixed points. Let gij be the involution of S defined by the deck transformation. The image of the natural representation [formula] in the group of isometries of E10 is contained in the reflection group W(E10) of E10, the subgroup generated by the reflections x  ↦  x + (x,α)α, where α2 =  - 2. It is the Coxeter group with respect to the basis formed by the vectors [formula] with the T-shaped Dynkin diagram of type T2,3,7. When S is unnodal, i.e. it does not contain smooth rational curves, the image [formula] of ρ contains a subgroup of finite index of W(E10) that coincides with the 2-level congruence subgroup [formula]. It is known that, in this case gij acts on E10 as [formula] for some orthogonal decomposition [formula]. The subgroup W(E10)(2) coincides with the normal closure of any g*ij.

For our first experiment, we take a non-degenerate isotropic 10-sequence [formula] and consider the automorphisms

[formula]

It is known that [formula] and [formula] is spanned by the classes fi,fj and the g*ij-invariant classes spanned by the classes [formula] of smooth rational curves blown down by φij. Let Mij be the sublattice of [formula] spanned by these classes. For any [formula], we have

[formula]

Using the intersection theory, we compute g*ij(γ) + γ as a linear combination of fi,fj and [formula]. Taking [formula], we compute the matrix Aij of g*ij in the basis [formula] of a sublattice of index 3 in [formula]. Then Maple computes for us the matrix of ck and also finds the characteristic polynomial of ck, its factorization into the product of irreducible polynomials and its real roots.

First we assume that the maps [formula] are finite morphisms. In this case Mij is spanned by fi,fj, and we get

[formula]

The Salem polynomials of [formula] are equal to

[formula]

Let

[formula]

Let us compute the matrices of c*k assuming that ri,i + 1 are the classes of smooth rational curves on S for [formula], where [formula]. In the Fano model, they are smooth rational curves of degree 3.

We have Mii + 1  =  〈fi,fi + 1,rii + 1〉 for [formula] and Mii + 1  =  〈fi,fi + 1〉 for i  >  m.

m  =  1

In this case M12 is spanned by f1,f2,r12 and we find (r12,fi + g*12(fi))  =  2 if i  ≠  1,2 and (r12,h + g*12(h)  =  6. This gives

[formula]

Since (r12,fi)  =  1 for i  >  2, the lattice Mii + 1 is spanned by fi,fi + 1 for [formula]. Thus the matrices of r*ii + 1 computed as in the previous case.

This allows one to compute the minimal polynomials for [formula]. We find

[formula]

m  =  2

In this case the matrix of g*12 and gj,j + 1,j  >  2, are unchanged from the previous case, but the matrix of g*23 changes in the way as in the previous case. We obtain the following Salem polynomials

[formula]

In the similar way we deal with the other cases.

m  =  3

The Salem polynomials are

[formula]

m  =  4

The Salem polynomials are

[formula]

The results of the computations of the dynamical degrees are given in the following table.

One may ask whether the configurations of the curves representing the classes r12,r23,r34,r45 can be realized on an Enriques surface. We omit the details to give the positive answer. If [formula], one can use the Torelli theorem to realize the corresponding Nikulin nodal invariant, and use that can always choose a Fano polarization in which the curves realizing the nodal invariant are of degree ≤  4. A more geometric construction can be given by taking a Reye model of an Enriques surface.

Now we give another specialization of a general Enriques surface.

Let

[formula]

The smooth rational curves representing the classes of r12',r23',r34' are conics in the Fano model.

We first assume that r12,r12' are represented by ( - 2)-curves. Then

[formula]

and Mi,i + 1  =  〈fi,fi + 1〉 for i  >  1. We have g*ii + 1|Mij is the identity, and

[formula]

This gives the matrices of g*kk + 1 in the basis [formula] of [formula]. The minimal polynomials for [formula]:

[formula]

Next we assume additionally that r23,r23' are represented by smooth rational curves. Then

[formula]

and Mi,i + 1  =  〈fi,fi + 1〉 for i  >  2. We have g*ii + 1|Mij is the identity, and

[formula]

This gives the matrices of gkk + 1 in the basis [formula] of [formula]. The minimal polynomials for [formula]:

[formula]

Finally, we assume that, additionally, r34,r34' are represented by ( - 2)-curves. We get

[formula]

We get the following minimal polynomials:

[formula]

The results of this experiment are put in the following table.

Enriques surfaces of Hessian type

Here we assume that [formula]. We take S to be a Enriques surface with the K3-cover X isomorphic to a minimal resolution of the quartic Hessian surface H of a nonsingular cubic surface (see [\cite=DG], [\cite=DK]) that admits a non-degenerate Sylvester form

[formula]

Since [formula], the equation of the Hessian surface H is

[formula]

The standard Cremona transformation

[formula]

has the fixed points with coordinates ±  λi. We additionally assume that none of them lies on the Hessian surface. For example, if [formula], it is enough to assume that [formula]. Under our assumption, the Cremona involution defines the Enriques involution τ of X.

We index the 10 nodes of H defined by xi = xj = xk  =  0,xa + xb  =  0 by Pab. The 10 edges of the Sylvester pentahedron are the lines xa = xb  =  xi + xj + xk  =  0. We denote them by Lab. They define on X two sets of 10 disjoint ( - 2)-curves Nab and Tab, the exceptional curves over the points Pab and the proper transforms of the edges Lab. The Enriques involution sends Nab to Tab.

The intersection graph of the twenty curves Nab,Tab is the Levi graph of the abstract Desargues symmetric configuration (103) (see [\cite=Dolgachehv3]. Its quotient by the involution Nab  →  Tab is the incidence graph of ten ( - 2)-curves Uab on S. The intersection graph of these 10 curves is the Petersen graph

We will identify ( - 2)-curves with their images in [formula]. Let δ be the sum of the curves Uab. Then it is easily checked that δ2  =  10, and h  ·  Uab  =  1. A lift Δ of δ is a Fano polarization of S. The curves Uab become lines in this model.

Let [formula] be the double cover defined by the projection of H from the node Pab. The edges Lcd passing through Pab (they satisfy [formula]) are projected to 3 points A,B,C in the plane. The edge La,b is projected to a line [formula] which intersects the sides triangle formed by A,B,C at three points AB,BC,AC. The image of Nab is the conic K passing through the points A,B,C. The branch curve of the projection is the union of two cubic curves F1,F2 that pass through the points A,B,C,AB,AC,BC and have the same tangent direction at A,B,C as the conic. The pre-images of the points A,B,C on Y is the union of the curves Tcd intersecting Nab and the exceptional curves over nodes of H on the lines Lcd except Nab.

In the first example we assume that the cubic surface does not contain Eckardt points, i.e. points where three lines meet. It is known that this happens if and only if λi  ≠  λj,i  ≠  j. The pre-image of the conic K on H is the residual conic of the plane section of H tangent along the edge Tab. Its equation is λaxa  +  λbxb  =  0.

Let hij be the deck transformation of the projection from the point Pij. For simplicity of the notation we assume that Pij  =  P12. Other formulas are obtained by applying the permutations of the numbers [formula]. The elliptic fibration |N15 + C15'|  =  |T15 + C15| has two more reducible fibers of type I6. They are

[formula]

The Enriques involution permutes the two pairs of reducible fibres and defines an elliptic fibration

[formula]

on S. It has a fiber of type I6, the image of the fibers G1,G1' on X, and a fiber U15 + C*12 of type I2, where C*12 is the image of the curves R15,C15 on S. It is easy to check that the deck transformation h*12 acts on the curves Nab,(a,b)  ≠  (1,2) via the transposition (12) of [formula]. It sends N15 to C15. This easily implies that

[formula]

In other words, h*12 acts by applying permutation (12) and adding f12 = U12. In fact, h*12 acts as the composition of the transposition in the indices 1,2,3,4,5 and the reflection rα12, where α12  =  f12 - U12.

Let us order the elliptic fibrations |2Fab| on S by ordering the pairs (a,b) in the following way:

[formula]

Let [formula] be the non-degenerate isotropic 10-sequence formed by the numerical classes of Fi. Using that (Uab,Fcd)  =  0 if and only if [formula], we find the expressions of Uab as linear combinations of the vectors fi:

[formula]

It is obvious that |2F12| is left invariant under h*12. Expressing the difference f12 - U12 in terms of fij, we find the matrix S12 of h*12 in the basis [formula].

[formula]

As in the previous section, each pair (fi,fj) of isotropic vectors defines a degree 2 morphism φij:X  →  D4 onto a 4-nodal quartic del Pezzo surface D4. It is given by the linear system |2Fi + 2Fj|. It blows down the common fiber components. It is easy to see using the intersections of fi with each Uab that common fibers components of |2Fab| and |2Fcd| are four curves if [formula] and 5 curves otherwise. They form two configurations of type A2 in the first case and three configurations of types A1,A1,A3 in the second case. For example, F12,F34 have common fiber components U13,U14,U23,U24 and the fibers F12,F13 have common components U12,U13,U14,U15,U23.

Let gij be the deck involution of X of the map φij. Its action g*ij on [formula] fixes the vectors fi,fj and also the connected components of the union of the fiber components. On each connected component of type A2 or A3 the involution acts as the non-trivial symmetry of the diagram. The action of gij on the orthogonal complement [formula] of the sublattice Mij generated by fi,fj and common irreducible components of the fibers of |2Fi| and |2Fj| is equal the minus identity.

Each gij belongs to the subgroup generated by projection involutions hab.

This can be verified by direct computation. For example, we find that g12  =  h45,g23  =  h25. However, we prefer to give a conceptual proof. The projection involution hab leaves invariant every edge of the Sylvester pentahedron that passes through it. Hence it leaves invariant any fi,j with [formula]. For simplicity of the notation, assume (a,b)  =  (1,2). We obtain that h12 and g34,35 leave invariant f34,f35. We also check that h12 leaves invariant the curves U45,U34,U35,U13 + U23. This implies that h12 and g34,35 coincide on the sublattice M89  =  M34,35. Hence they both act on [formula] as the identity on M89 and the minus identity on the orthogonal complement [formula]. Thus they coincide. This shows that

[formula]

hence each gab,ac coincides with hij where [formula]. In similar way, we check that gab,cd with [formula] coincides with the product habhcd.

Now we are ready to make experiments by computing the dynamical degrees of the transformations from the group Γ generated by hab.

First, we compare the dynamical degrees of [formula] acting on S with the general case considered in the previous section. We find that the Salem polynomial of ck is equal to x4 - 4x3 - 2x2 - 4x + 1 for k  =  3,7,9, it is equal to x6 - 5x5 - 4x4 - 12x3 - 4x2 - 5x + 1 if k  =  8 and in the remaining cases the characteristic polynomial is the product of cyclotomic polynomials. The numerical values of the Salem numbers are 6.61.. for k = 3,7,9 and 6.01.. for k  =  8. These are substantials drops comparing to the generic case.

Our next examples are obtained by computing the dynamical degrees of random words in generators hab. Note that the group generated by hab is the quotient of the Coxeter group whose vertices are the same as in the Petersen graph but two vertices (ab),(cd) are joined by a thick edge if and only if [formula] (thick edge means that the order of the product is infinity). The graph is 6-regular, i.e. each vertex lies on 6 thick edges.

The following table gives Salem polynomials, their real eigenvalues obtained from different subdiagrams of the Coxeter diagram with N  ≤  5 vertices.

Let us specialize the previous example by assuming that the Hessian surface is the Hessian surface of a nonsingular cubic surface with 6 Eckardt points. This is equivalent to the condition that the four coefficients [formula] are equal. Thus, we may assume that the Hessian surface H is given by equations:

[formula]

The six nodes Pab with a,b∈{1,2,3,4} of H are the Eckardt points of the cubic surface. For each such pair the conic Cab splits in the union of two lines passing through the point Pab. For example, the components of C12 are given by equations

[formula]

where ω is the third root of 1 different from 1. The projection from the node Pab has the branch curve equal to the union of an irreducible cubic F through the points A,B,C,AB,AC,BC, the conic C through A,B,C tangent to F at these points, and the line [formula] through AB,AC,BC. The elliptic fibration |2Fab| on Y has one reducible fiber of type I4 and two reducible fibers of type I6. The fiber of type I4 is formed by Rab + Cab' + Cab'' + Tab, where Cab',Cab'' are the proper transforms of the components of Cab on Y. Its image on X is a double fiber of type I2 formed by Uab and U*ab. The curves Uab are conics on the Fano model of X. The elliptic fibrations |2F15|,|2F25|,|2F35|,|2F45| have reducible fibers of types I2,I3 and I6. For example, |2F15| has fibers U45 + C45,U*23 + U*24 + U*34 and U14 + U13 + U14 + U25 + U35 + U45.

The six curves U*ab,a,b  ≠  5, do not intersect Ucd  ≠  Uab. Each U*ab intersects 4 other curves U*cd. For example, U*12 intersects U*14,U*24,U*13,U*23.

One can compute the classes of U*ab in terms of the basis [formula]. We have

[formula]

This shows that U*12 is an irreducible component of a fiber of four elliptic fibrations |2F12|,|2F35|,|2F34|.

As before we have involutions gij defined by the pairs (fi,fj) of isotropic vectors. Let sij be the involutions defined by the projections from the points Pij,1  ≤  i < j  ≤  4. They act on the curves Uab via transpositions of {1,2,3,4}. Other four projections do not preserve the set of the curves Uab, and we will not consider them.

Let Γ be the subgroup of [formula] generated by gab,sij. Next, as in the previous example, we compute the action of each generator on [formula] in the basis [formula]. The subgroup [formula] generated by the permutations sij has 5 orbits on the set of pairs (fi,fj). They are represented by the pairs

[formula]

One checks that first three pairs have the same common fiber components as in the previous example, so the matrix of gij will be the same.

The pair (f1,f9) has, additionally, the common component U*12 that does not intersect the 'old' common components. We write

[formula]

Intersecting with f1,f2 we get a1  =  a2  =  2. Intersecting with U*12 we find 2 =  - 2a3 that gives a3  =   - 1. Intersecting with other components, we find 0  =   - 2a5 + a6,0  =   - 2a6 + a5,1  =   - 2a4 + a7,1  =   - 2a7 + a4. This gives (a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7)  =  (2,2, - 2,0,0, - 1, - 1), hence

[formula]

Continuing in this way we compute the matrix

[formula]

The computer checks that A19  =  s12h35. We have the following new conics in the Fano model

[formula]

A pair of isotropic vectors fi,fj has U*ab as a common fiber component only fi,fj occur in the expression of U*ab. The action of gij will change only in this case. For example, g12 is represented by the same matrix as in the general case. We check that g34  =  s23 and g12  =  h45. Applying permutations, we obtain

The group Γ generated by deck involutions gij and projection involutions hij is generated by h15,h25,h35,h45 and transposition s12,s23,s34 acting by permuting [formula].

Now we continue our experiments. The following table gives the Salem polynomials and Salem numbers for words in the generators of γ corresponding to subdiagrams of the Coxeter graph with number N of vertices ≤  5.

By taking N  >  5, and taking random sequences of involutions hi5,sab, we were able to find the following Salem polynomials of degree 6 and 10 with smallest Salem numbers:

[formula]

Coble rational surfaces and Desargues configurations

Recall that a Coble surface is a smooth rational surface V such that [formula] but [formula]. A classical example of a Coble surface is the blow-up of the plane at 10 nodes [formula] of an irreducible plane curve C of degree 10. If [formula], the double cover of X branched along the proper inverse transform of C is a K3 surface X. The ramification curve R is a smooth rational curve. One can view X as a degeneration of the K3-cover of an Enriques surface when the covering involution acquires the fixed-point set equal to a smooth rational curve. The orthogonal complement of KV in [formula] is a quadratic lattice isomorphic to E10. It has a basis formed by the vectors [formula], where e0 is the class of the pre-image of a line in the plane and [formula] are the classes of the exceptional curves of the blow-up. Since [formula], a different basis is formed by the classes [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. We have [formula], where [formula] and δ2  =  10. The classes fi represent the classes of the proper transforms on V of cubic curves passing through nine of the double points of C. This is all in a complete analogy with isotropic 10-sequence [formula] on an Enriques surface and its Fano polarization δ which we dealt with in the previous sections. Moreover, the linear system |2fi + 2fj| defines a degree 2 map φij from V to a quartic del Pezzo surface D, as in the case of Enriques surfaces. The difference here is that the map is never finite since it blows down the curve C. Nevertheless, when V is general enough (see the precise meaning of this in [\cite=CD]), the deck transformation defines an involution gij on V that acts on [formula] as the identity, and acts on the orthogonal complement [formula] as the minus identity. This allows us to consider the group generated by gij and compute the dynamical degrees of the hyperbolic automorphism from this group. They completely agree with one we considered for an Enriques surface.

A general Coble surface V does not have smooth rational curves with self-intersection ( - 2) (we call then ( - 2)-curves for short), the curve C has self-intersection equal to - 4. If such a curve appears as a common fiber component of the elliptic pencils |2fi| and |2fj|, then it is blown-down by φij and the involution gij become the identity on the sublattice Mij spanned by fi,fj and invariant part of the span of common fiber components, it is the minus identity on the orthogoanl complement of Mij. This allows us to write the matrix of the involution gij as in the case of Enriques surfaces.

We assume that the sequence [formula] is non-degenerate, i.e. all curves representing fi are irreducible elliptic curves. If R is a common irreducible component of |2fi| and |2fj|, then intersecting with δ, we find that (δ,R)  ≤  4. Since (KV,R)  =  0, this is equivalent to that R is a proper inverse transform of a plane curve of degree ≤  4. It could be a line passing through three points pi,pj,pk, a conic through 6 points pi, a cubic passing through eight points, one of them is its singular point, or a quartic passing through all points, two of them are its singular points. They are represented by the respective classes in En of types

[formula]

These are exactly classes of rational smooth curves in E10 which we used in the previous sections. This allows us to realize explicit examples of degenerations of a Coble surface in a much easier and more explicit way comparing to the case of Enriques surfaces.

The Hessian types of Enriques surfaces which we considered in the previous section have also beautiful analogs for Coble surfaces. Recall that a Desargues configuration (103) is an abstract configuration of lines and points, where each line is contained in three points, and each line contains three points. It can be realized in the real projective plane by taking two perspective triangles (see, for example, [\cite=CAG], 2.1.4). There is a beautiful fact, due to J. Thas [\cite=Thas] that the 10 points in a Desargues configuration are double points of an irreducible rational curve. Thus their blow-up is a Coble surface. The proper transform of 10 lines is the set of ten ( - 2)-curves Uab on V whose intersection graph is the Petersen graph. So, V should be considered as the analog of the Hessian type Enriques surfaces. In fact, one can show that V is isomorphic to the Hessian of a cubic surface with one ordinary double point. This can be used to give another proof of Thas's result. Everything else extends from the case of Enriques surfaces to the case of Coble surfaces. All computations which we made for general Enriques surfaces of Hessian type are applied without change to automorphism of Coble surfaces. Note that all such Coble surfaces depend on 3 parameters.

The Coble surface analog of the family of Enriques surfaces corresponding to the Hessian surfaces of cubic surfaces with 3 Eckardt points is the Coble surface obtained as the quotient of the Hessian surface of the Cayley 4-nodal cubic surface with equation

[formula]

The equation of the Hessian surface is

[formula]

[formula]

It has 14 ordinary nodes with coordinates of type (1,0,0,0),(1, - 1,0,0) and (1,1,1, - 1). The standard Cremona transformation inverts the coordinates, fixes the last four nodes. The quotient is a rational surface with four singular points of multiplicity 4, a minimal resolution is a Coble rational surface V with | - 2KV|  =  {C1 + C2 + C3 + C4}, where each Ci is a smooth rational curve with self-intersection - 4. It follows that K2V  =   - 13. The surface is obtained by the blowing up 13 points in the projective plane, the double points of the union of two conics, and two lines. Ten of these intersection points must be the triple points of a Desargues configuration of 10 lines. I do not know how to write the equation of this Desargues configuration.

One checks that hyperplane sections xi + xj  =  0 intersect the Hessian along the union of the edge xi = xj  =  0 and a line [formula] taken with multiplicity 2. Each line passes through one of six singular points of type (1, - 1,0,0) and intersects the opposite edge at one nonsingular point. It contains two fixed points of the Cremona involutions. Comparing with the Enriques case, we see that the six additional conics degenerate to double lines. The elliptic fibration on the minimal resolution X of H corresponding to the node on the line [formula] has one reducible fiber of types I*0 and two reducible fibers of type I6. Its image on the Coble surface is an (non-minimal) elliptic fibration with one reducible fiber of type I6 and one reducible fiber obtained from a fiber the minimal elliptic fibration of type III by blowing up its the singular points (one of them is infinitely near).

Our calculations for Enriques surfaces of this type extend to Coble surfaces without change.

Note that the linear system of homogeneous quartic polynomials in variables x1,x2,x3,x4 with ordinary critical points at (1,0,0,0),(0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0),(0,0,0,1) is spanned by 10 polynomials

[formula]

where all indices are distinct. The non-degenerate Hessian of a nonsingular cubic surface belongs to the 4-dimensional linear system of quartic surfaces with equation:

[formula]

[formula]

The equation of the Hessian of a cubic with 3 Eckardt points belongs to the pencil defined by λ1  =  λ2  =  λ3  =  λ4.

The equation of the Hessian surface of the 4-nodal cubic surface given by equation [\eqref=cayley] is obtained when we take λ5  =  0. Lifting our automorphisms of the Enriques surfaces (resp. Coble surfaces) to their K3-covers gives examples of automorphisms of a smooth family of K3 surfaces parameterized by the affine line with constant dynamical degree >  1. Note that family is a lattice polarized family of K3 surfaces, the lattice being the lattice E10(2).

Questions and comments

One of the goals of our computer experiments was to find a hyperbolic automorphism f of an Enriques surface of small as possible dynamical degree λf. It follows from [\cite=Oguiso] that the first four smallest Salem numbers of degree ≤  10 cannot be realized by an automorphism of an Enriques surface. So, the natural question is the following.

What is the smallest Salem number larger than one of given degree d  =  2,4,6,8,10 realized by an automorphism of an Enriques surface?

The smallest Salem numbers appear in our computations are the following

[formula]

I am sure that these are not optimal results. Note that there exist examples of rational and K3 surfaces realizing very small Salem numbers, even the Lehmer number (see, [\cite=McMul4], [\cite=Oguiso]).

Let [formula] be the universal Coxeter group, i.e. the free product of cyclic groups of order 2. In section 2, we constructed representations of [formula] in the group of automorphisms of Enriques surface which admit a non-degenerate isotropic sequence [formula].

Is the homomorphism [formula] injective when S is an unnodal Enriques surface.

At the end of the previous section we have constructed a one-dimensional family (Xt,f) of lattice polarized smooth K3 surfaces with an automorphism of the family such that its hyperbolic specializations have constant dynamical degrees. It has the property that its image in the coarse moduli space of lattice polarized K3 surfaces is closed. We call such a family equi-dynamical.

What is the largest dimension of an equi-dynamical family (Xt,f) of lattice polarized K3 surfaces whose image in the coarse moduli space is closed and that it admits an automorphism of dynamical degree >  1?

For any positive real T and an ample class h on X, set

Assume that Γ* is not elementary geometrically finite group of isometries of the hyperbolic space associated with [formula]. It is known that in this case there exits an asymptotic expansion of this function of T whose leading term is equal to TδΓ, where δΓ is the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of the group Γ*, the image of Γ in [formula], acting on the Lobachevsky space associated to [formula] (see [\cite=Dolgachev2]. When Γ* is of finite covolume (e.g., for example, acting on a K3 or Enriques surface with no smooth rational curves), then [formula], where [formula]. The Hausdorff dimension δΓ is notoriously difficult to compute, and numerical computations are known only in a few cases.

In notation of Theorem [\ref=xie], where we replace f by the whole group Γ, is the function
