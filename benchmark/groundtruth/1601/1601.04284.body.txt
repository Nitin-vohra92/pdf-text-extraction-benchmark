Keywords: Strange stars; Mass defects; Strange quark matter; Nonperturbative equation of state.

Introduction

In pioneer works, V. L. Ambartsumyan and G. S. Saakyan considered the question of superdense stellar matter made of a degenerate gas of elementary particles, comprising neutron, protons, hyperons and electrons, at zero temperature [\cite=Amb1] [\cite=Amb2]. Investigations of internal structures of these compact configurations led to the possibility of stellar transitions of explosive character, from a metastable state to a stable state, with great amounts of liberated energy [\cite=Amb3] [\cite=Sak]. These transitions were related to stars with negative (or anomalous) mass defects characterized by energy excesses with respect to the energies they would have to be (stable) bound systems. Anomalous mass defects were interpreted in terms of a catastrophic additivity violation of the internal energy due to the very intense gravitational fields in the interior of such superdense stellar configurations [\cite=Amb4] [\cite=Amb5]. An important aspect of these early works rests on the fact that they included the strange baryons - hyperons - in the degenerate (strange) nuclear plasma together with neutrons, protons and electrons.

The baryons being made of quarks, it appeared to be natural to expect unbound quarks to exist in the interior of hyperdense stars. Within this assumption, and in an epoch when the physics of the strong interactions was very incomplete, N. Itoh considered the possibility of hypothetical compact stars made of pure quark matter [\cite=Ito].

With the subsequent developments of the strong interactions theory, new interests came into play connecting the strange nuclear plasma with the physics of quarks. The nuclear interactions within the superdense stellar matter turned out to be described in terms of the baryon constituent quarks. In this context, the strange quark matter (SQM) concept appeared leading to the conjecture of the absolute stability of nuclear matter.

The Bodmer-Witten conjecture [\cite=Bod] [\cite=Wit], which says that the SQM should be the true ground state of the nuclear matter, has attracted a great deal of attention. SQM is a type of quark matter made of approximately equal amounts of u, d and s quarks with a small admixture of electrons in order to maintain the charge neutrality. Its energy per baryon might be lower than the one in ordinary nuclear matter. The SQM properties are of great importance for nuclear physics and astrophysics. In the nuclear physics context, E. Farhi and R. L. Jaffe studied, within the MIT Bag Model (MBM), the dependence of the SQM stability on the model parameters, namely, the bag constant B, the strong interactions coupling constant αc, and the strange quark mass ms [\cite=Far]. In the astrophysical context, the Bodmer-Witten conjecture has probed to be of great significance for the physics of the strange stars. Since the 1980's, the properties of strange stars have been considered within the MBM  [\cite=AFO] [\cite=HZS] [\cite=Var2] [\cite=Koh]. In the MBM, the quarks enter the equation of state (EOS) as free particles, with the quark confinement being represented by the bag constant B. At that time, due to the highly nonlinear character of the theory of strong interactions, it was difficult to deal with a definite model of EOS naturally including the quark confinement in terms of the interactions between quarks and antiquarks, and gluons. Thanks to the developments of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental theory of the strong interactions, great advances have been made to derive an EOS, including perturbative and/or nonperturbative effects of confinement, to describe quark matter at all finite densities and temperatures.

Recently, Yu. A. Simonov derived, from the first principles, the nonperturbative equation of state (NPEOS) of the quark-gluon plasma in the framework of the Field Correlator Method (FCM) [\cite=Si6]. In the FCM (for a review see Ref. [\cite=DiG] and references therein), the dynamics of confinement is naturally included in terms of the color-electric and color-magnetic correlators. The main parameters of the model that enter the NPEOS are the gluon condensate G2 and the large distance static Q potential V1, at fixed quark masses and temperature. The model covers the entire phase diagram plane, from the low T and large μ regime to the large T and low μ regime. By connecting the FCM and lattice simulations, at μc = 0 , the critical temperature turned out to be [formula] MeV for G2 = 0.00682  GeV4 [\cite=ST1] [\cite=ST2]. Very recently, V. D. Orlovsky and Yu. A. Simonov considered the quark-hadron thermodynamics in the presence of the magnetic field within the FCM [\cite=OS].

Astrophysical applications of the FCM have been made in the study of neutron stars interiors [\cite=Bur] [\cite=Bal] [\cite=Plu] and in the early Universe cosmology [\cite=Cas]. The authors of Ref. [\cite=Bom] [\cite=Log1] [\cite=Log2] also applied the FCM to the study of phase transitions in neutron stars matter and to the investigation of the structural properties and stability of hybrid stars.

Recently we applied the FCM to investigate the properties of the strange stars and the SQM stability in Refs. [\cite=Fla1] [\cite=Fla2]. Of particular significance is the gradual decrease of the widths of the SQM stability windows with the increase of V1 , being zero at V1 = 0.5  GeV , the value of V1 determined from lattice calculations [\cite=KaZ]. This aspect is of great importance to investigate the existence of strangelets, mainly in the case of exploding stars with the liberation of matter/energy into the free space, which we here briefly consider (at the end of the present paper).

In the present work, we study the general aspects of the mass defects of strange stars, without crust and magnetic field, within the framework of the FCM. We do not consider the crust here by the same reasons we disregarded it in our previous paper [\cite=Fla1]. Crust contributions to the masses of strange stars have been estimated to be [formula] [\cite=AFO], [formula] [\cite=Var4] [\cite=Var5], and [formula] [\cite=TLu]. As we shall see below, the mass defects magnitudes we obtained in the present work are of the order of [formula] , corresponding to [formula] , [formula] , and [formula] , respectively. Crusts are important to investigate compact stars glitches, but we assume here that they are meaningless for the purposes of the present work. On the other hand, in this first attempt to investigate the mass defects of the strange stars, we are interested in the solutions not affected by preferred directions due to magnetic fields, of particular importance to investigate magnetars and soft gamma-ray repeaters [\cite=Hur] as well.

Differently from our strategy adopted in Ref. [\cite=Fla1], we here also consider unstable solutions of the hydrostatic equilibrium equations of Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov. As a result, depending on the values of the model parameters, G2 and V1 , solutions with non-negative and/or negative mass defects along a given sequence of stellar configurations are possible. Our aim is to understand the effects of the nonperturbative dynamics of confinement on the binding energies of the strange stars. We give special attention to the anomalous mass defects and, at the end of the paper, briefly comment the corresponding consequences for astrophysical phenomena, such as gamma-ray bursts, supernovae neutrinos or quark-novae explosions.

The present paper is organized as follows. In Sec. [\ref=npeos] we show the main equations to be used in our calculation. In Sec. [\ref=stc] we present the equations to calculate the important quantities of the stellar configurations. In Sec. [\ref=res] we show the results and in Sec. [\ref=frmks] we give the final remarks.

The NPEOS at zero temperature

In previous works, we outlined the main features of the FCM and showed the equations used to investigate strange stars and strange quark matter properties [\cite=Fla1] [\cite=Fla2]. So, we now write only the main equations we need here.

For constant V1, the pressure, energy density and number density of a (one flavor) quark gas at T = 0 are given by

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

where

[formula]

and Nc = 3 is the color number. When V1 = 0, the ordinary Fermi momentum kF of a free quark gas is recovered. The additional term (V1 / 2)k3q / 3   in Eq.([\ref=eqT0]) comes from the large distance static [formula] potential V1.

Inside a strange star, the weak interaction reactions [formula] and [formula] imply energy loss by neutrino diffusion. In this case, by setting [formula], the chemical equilibrium is given by

[formula]

The overall charge neutrality requires that

[formula]

where ni is the number density of the particle i = u,d,s,e.

To calculate stellar configurations, with charge neutrality and chemical equilibrium, the total pressure and energy density, including electrons are given by

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the vacuum energy density difference between confined and deconfined phases and Nf is the number of flavors. The difference between the values of the gluon condensate, as predicted by lattice calculations, is [formula] [\cite=ST1] [\cite=ST2].

In order to obtain the numerical correspondence between FCM and MBM, we make the identifications: Δ|εvac| = B and V1 = 0. However, we here emphasize that Δ|εvac| is essentially a nonperturbative quantity. For the quark masses, we use mu = 5 MeV, md = 7 MeV and ms = 150 MeV. The corresponding equations for the degenerate electron gas are similar to the ones above and can be easily obtained by making the changes: [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula]. We use the same numerical strategy adopted in Ref. [\cite=Fla1] to calculate strange stars configurations.

compact stars configurations

Compact stars configurations are calculated by numerical integration of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov hydrostatic equilibrium equations [\cite=ShT] [\cite=Gle] [\cite=ZeN]. Of particular importance here is the total gravitational mass of a compact star,

[formula]

which is the mass that governs the Keplerian orbital motion of the distant gravitating bodies around it, as measured by external observers. The proper mass is given by

[formula]

where dV(r) = 4π[1  -  2Gm(r)  /  r]- 1 / 2  r2  dr and m(r) is the mass within a sphere of radius r. The proper mass is the sum of the mass elements dm(r) = ε(r)  dV(r) measured by a local observer. The baryonic mass (also called rest mass) of a star is MA = NAmA, where

[formula]

is the number of baryons within the star, mA is the mass of the baryonic specie A, and

[formula]

is the baryon number density. The baryonic mass has a simple interpretation: it is the mass that the star would have if its baryon content were dispersed at infinity. In the case of the strange stars (because of the quark confinement), NA is the equivalent number of baryons (not quarks). Tere is some freedom to choose the baryonic mass. In earlier texts, the baryonic mass was taken as the mass mH of the hydrogen atom  [\cite=Amb3]; the 56Fe mass per baryon [formula]  [\cite=Var2] [\cite=HTW] [\cite=ZeN] [\cite=Var1] [\cite=Var3]; or the neutron mass mn [\cite=Sak] [\cite=Amb4] [\cite=Fla1] [\cite=Gle]. We here assume mA = mn, as in Ref. [\cite=Fla1]. Comparison of some results with respect to m0 is also made below.

Let us now consider the mass defect of a compact stars we are concerned in the present work. The incomplete mass defect or, for short, the mass defect is the difference Δ2M = MA - M (which in our notation is minus the binding energy Eb defined in Refs.  [\cite=ZeN] [\cite=Gle]). It corresponds to the energy released to aggregate from infinity the dispersed baryonic matter. A stellar configuration is stable if Δ2M > 0 (normal mass defect) and unstable if Δ2M < 0 (anomalous mass defect).

Results

We calculated sequences of strange star configurations for central densities in the range 11 <  log ρc < 18. In general, the forms of the sequences and the respective mass defects of stellar configurations strongly depend on the values of the model parameters. A typical example is shown in Fig. [\ref=mg2v11], for [formula][\cite=Si6] and V1 = 0. The stellar sequence present three branches delimited at the labeled points 1 and 2, where the solid and dashed curves cross itself, and in which M = MA, as shown in panel (a). In the intermediate branch we have M < MA, required by the stability conditions against transition to diffuse matter. We have M > MA at densities [formula] in the first branch, and [formula] in the third branch.

An investigation of strange stars within MBM, for the values of the bag constant in the range 50  MeV  fm -  3  ≤  B  ≤  70  MeV  fm -  3, showed the absence of the anomalous mass defect in strange stars [\cite=Var3]. Anomalous mass defects does not have been obtained because of the low used values of B, which numerically correspond (in our calculation with V1 = 0) to lower values of Δ|εvac.| (or G2  ). In fact, in the FCM, for V1 = 0 and [formula], the stellar configurations present normal mass defects. To obtain, within the MBM, stellar configurations with anomalous mass defects in the first branch we need B > 78.7  MeV  fm -  3 (corresponding to [formula]). To obtain anomalous mass defects both in first and in third branches, we need [formula] (corresponding to [formula]). Values of B between 150  MeV  fm -  3 and 170  MeV  fm -  3 were considered to explain the time elapsed between the transition from a metastable neutron star generated by a supernova explosion and the new collapse generating the delayed gamma-ray burst by the authors of Ref. [\cite=Ber]. Moreover, higher values of B up to 337  MeV  fm -  3 and 353  MeV  fm -  3 were considered, but to calculate at nonzero temperatures the quark deconfinement in the cores of protoneutron stars [\cite=Lug].

Of particular interest is the dependence of M with the number of baryons NA shown in panel (b), with the labels 1 and 2 as in panel (a). The cusp is at the maximum value of M, where NA is also maximum. Also shown is the MA plot with its upper "endpoint" at the maximum MA . In the upper part of the M  vs.  NA plot (above 1) the situation is analogous to that of neutron stars in that dM / dNA < mA everywhere on the corresponding plot segments; M < MA in the second branch and M > MA in the third branch [\cite=ZeN]. However, a fact that was not observed in earlier works (because of the EOS used) is that M > MA in the first branch (below 1). Moreover, the slope starts with dM / dNA > mA , turns to dM / dNA = mA at an intermediate point and then to dM / dNA < mA as NA grows. In contrast with neutron star configurations, we have here a situation with M > MA and dM / dNA > mA apparently not obeying the dM / dNA = mA  1 / 2 prescription [\cite=HTW]. This is a characteristic feature of the anomalous mass defects occurring in the first branch making evident the role of the confinement effects.

Panel (c) shows the mass defect as function of [formula] with the delimiters 1 and 2 as in panels (a) and (b). Differently from Refs. [\cite=Amb1] [\cite=Amb2] [\cite=Sak], the mass defects are also negative in the first and third branches. For the given values of the parameters G2 and V1, the maximum Δ2M magnitude is of the order of [formula] at [formula] in the first branch, and [formula] at the endpoint of the third branch at [formula].

A variety of behaviors can be obtained by the variation of the model parameters. Some typical examples are shown in Fig. [\ref=mg2v12]. Panels (a) and (b) show the case M < MA for which the mass defect has the normal sign (Δ2M > 0) everywhere along the sequence of stellar configurations, as in panel (c). Panels (d) and (e) correspond to the limit M = MA at the maximum mass, but with anomalous mass defects at all the other points of the stellar sequence with M > MA, as depicted in panel (f). Finally, panels (g) and (h) show the case M > MA, so Δ2M < 0 at all points along the sequence, as in panel (i). Notice the pronounced confinement effects on the stellar sequences in panels (d)-(f) and (g)-(i). This general overview shows us that anomalous mass defects can (in principle) be obtained for arbitrary values of the model parameters. If G2 is low, V1 must be increased in order to yield anomalous mass defect; if V1 is low, G2 must grow in order to produce the same effect. As it was stated above, new results emerge with the use of the NPEOS provided by the FCM: for V1 in the range [formula], stellar configurations with anomalous mass defects are possible not only in the first branch but also in the third branch, at densities larger than the nuclear one. Merely illustratively, we also show the proper mass MP which is greater than both M and MA.

On account of the above features, in the energy range we are considering, the G2 - V1 plane can be divided in three different regions according to the signs of Δ2M as shown in Fig. [\ref=d2mg2v1]. In doing so, we obtain three regions. The first region, A, with Δ2M > 0 everywhere on the sequence. In the second region, B, with features analogous to those in Fig. [\ref=mg2v11], both normal and anomalous mass defects are present in the same stellar sequence. Finally, the third region, C, with Δ2M < 0 along all the sequence of stellar configurations. The idea of Fig. [\ref=d2mg2v1] serves to predict values of V1 and G2 according to the types of the stellar configurations and the respective mass defects we want.

A star with anomalous mass defect has an exceeding stored energy with respect to the one needed to form a compact stable bound system. In principle, in a given sequence of stellar configurations, any star with Δ2M < 0 might explode or implode (for example, in the presence of certain perturbations) with a liberation of an enormous amount of energy. In the case of explosion, the scattered matter will have a nonzero kinetic energy at infinity.

On the other hand, it is well known that stellar configurations obtained from Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations are stable if dM / dρc > 0 , corresponding to the stars in the ascending branch of the stellar sequence, as in panel (a) of Fig. [\ref=mg2v11]. In the descending branch, where dM / dρc < 0, the stellar configurations are unstable against gravitational collapse to black hole. Then, a stable configuration pass from stability to instability at the peak of the sequence where M, MA and NA attain their maximums (for a detailed analysis of stability, see Refs.: [\cite=Gle] [\cite=HTW]). Hence, the investigation of the mass defects in this transition limit may be of particular interest.

Among the many possibilities, as the ones shown in Figs. [\ref=mg2v11] and [\ref=mg2v12], let us now consider (both normal and anomalous) mass defects at the maximum masses of the stellar configurations, as depicted in Fig. [\ref=d2mg2v11]. The plots cover a large area in the G2  -  Δ2M plane, as shown in panel (a). It is evident that nonnegative values of Δ2M occur for [formula] , which gives the vacuum energy density [formula]. Above these values of G2 (or Δ|εvac|), Δ2M is anomalous whatever the values of V1 may be between zero and 0.5 GeV.

At V1 = 0.5  GeV  , the anomalous mass defect attains its maximum magnitude at [formula] , but for [formula] , corresponding to a strange star with [formula] and [formula] . In the FCM framework, this is the maximum allowed energy to be liberated in a possible explosion. Such a star has a fraction of stored energy around [formula], but it is not a maximum. For instance, in the range [formula] , the fractions of the mass excess may be as large as [formula]  for V1 = 0.3  GeV and G2 = 0.006  GeV4 ; [formula]  for V1 = 0.4  GeV  and G2 = 0.007  GeV4 ; and [formula]  for V1 = 0.5  GeV  and G2 = 0.0095  GeV4 . Concerning the masses in the above range of the anomalous mass defects, along the V1 = 0.5  GeV curve, they vary from [formula] (maximum at the Δ2M = 0 limit) at [formula] to [formula] at G2 = 0.0095  GeV4. For other values of V1 the masses assume intermediate values.

As G2 increases, the apparent "convergence" of the curves led us (speculatively) to extrapolate our calculations to G2 = 0.1  GeV4, beyond the limits of the analysis made in Ref. [\cite=Iof], as shown in panel (b). As a result we obtained a slightly ascending tail with [formula] at the endpoint. Along this tail the masses vary, for example, from [formula] at V1 = 0 and G2 = 0.05  GeV4 to [formula] at V1 = 0.5  GeV and G2 = 0.1  GeV4. For the intermediate values of V1 the masses are also intermediate. The mass excess fractions may be as large as [formula]  for V1 = 0 and G2 = 0.05  GeV4 ; [formula]  for V1 = 0.3  GeV and G2 = 0.08  GeV4 ; and [formula]  for V1 = 0.5  GeV and G2 = 0.1  GeV4 . Extending (now, arbitrarily speculatively) our extrapolation to G2 = 1  GeV4 , the anomalous mass defects along the tail are not greater than [formula] . At G2 = 1  GeV4  , the masses vary from [formula] at V1 = 0 to [formula] at V1 = 0.5  GeV  ; the excess fractions changing from [formula] to [formula] , respectively.

For large values of G2 (say, G2 > 0.07  GeV4) , the curves concentrate in a narrow band. Then, it should be very difficult (or a very accurate determination, as for instance in gamma-ray bursts observations, should be required) to extract, from the |Δ2M| measurements around [formula] , reasonable estimates for V1 and/or G2. By the way, as a general case in the G2  -  Δ2M plane, we need an additional measurement to determine unambiguously the model parameters G2 and V1. For the sake of comparison with the MBM, the open circles along the V1 = 0 curve correspond to the values of B used in Refs. [\cite=AFO] [\cite=HZS] [\cite=Koh] [\cite=Var1] [\cite=Var2] [\cite=Var3] [\cite=Ber].

Here, a curious fact comes from the supernova SN1987A. Two neutrino signals were detected at Kamiokande II and IMB [\cite=Kah] [\cite=Arn]. The total energy of the observed neutrinos was found to be [formula]. It was pointed out that the first signal might have been originated in the formation of a neutron star after the supernova explosion and the second signal in a possible formation of a strange star [\cite=Var3]. It is inquisitive the fact that this energy, liberated in the form of neutrinos, is roughly coincident with the values of |Δ2M| along the tail in panel (b) of Fig. [\ref=d2mg2v11]. Also, of similar magnitude are the gamma-ray bursts GRB970828 with [formula] [\cite=Ber] and GRB971214 with an inferred energy loss of [formula] [\cite=Kul] (assuming isotropic emissions). Hence, measurements of Δ2M around these energy values may be of particular importance.

Finally, within our freedom to choose the value of mA, we performed our investigation assuming mA = mn. Taking into account that mA enters the expression of MA as an external factor multiplying NA in Eq. [\ref=NA], the conversion formula given Δ2M in terms of m0 = m(56Fe) / 56 is

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] . In Fig. [\ref=d2mg2v1Fe], the curves corresponding to mA = m0 are slightly shifted with respect the ones for mA = mn. In the context of baryonic stars, interesting comments about the possibility of states with Δ2M < 0 be reached by the release of nuclear energy, for case of rarefied hydrogen and the case of rarefied iron vapor dispersed at infinity, are made in Ref.: [\cite=ZeN].

Final remarks

Previous investigations showed that the FCM provides new possibilities for the investigation of compact stellar configurations [\cite=Bal] [\cite=Bur] [\cite=Plu] [\cite=Bom] [\cite=Log1] [\cite=Log2] [\cite=Fla1]. In the present work, we considered the general aspects of the mass defects of strange stars within the FCM without magnetic field, with special emphasis on the anomalous mass defects. Concerning the magnitudes of the anomalous mass defects, our results are consistent with the estimated electromagnetic energies of the gamma-ray bursts, varying from [formula]  in GRB970508 to [formula]  in GRB011211 (assuming isotropic emission), given in Table 1 of Ref. [\cite=Ber] , and the theoretical energy predictions of quark-nova explosions [\cite=RaD].

Since quarks are not freely observed, a strange star in an explosion process must liberate its energy excess as neutrinos, gamma-rays, gravitational waves, or other forms of matter/energy. If the ejected matter is made of hadrons, then a transformation to the hadron phase is needed in order to disperse the hadronic content to infinity. Another possibility would be the energy release in the form of strangelets [\cite=Wit] [\cite=Far] [\cite=AFO]. Strangelets are lumps of self-bound matter containing as few as a thousand of u, d and s quarks. The question of strangelets was considered in Ref. [\cite=Klu]. It was argued that a disruption of a strange star would contaminate the Galaxy with an exceeding density of strangelets with respect to that required to transform neutron stars into strange stars [\cite=Cal]. However, in order to such a contamination takes place, it is expected that the strangelets must survive a long time, hence the need to investigate the SQM stability.

Very recently, we considered for several values of V1 the behavior of the stability windows of the SQM (with respect to the [formula] nucleus) with chemical equilibrium and charge neutrality (cf. panel (a) of Fig. 3 in Ref.: [\cite=Fla2]). Within the same line, we determined here the value of V1 in order to give a zero stability window at the s-quark mass ms = 0.15  GeV . As a result we obtained V1 = 0.33  GeV, as shown in panel (a) of Fig. [\ref=fewin], which also includes (for comparison) the nonzero windows at V1 = 0 , 0.1 GeV and 0.2 GeV. At the given s-quark mass (dashed horizontal line), the stability windows are zero in the range [formula] . On the other hand, the largest window width occurs at V1 = 0 for any s-quark mass [formula], being maximum at ms = 0 . Then, it should be interesting to express the SQM stability, at a given ms, in terms of a relative stability, which we crudely estimated by considering three different possibilities. If for each value of V1 , we compare the width of the stability window at ms = 0.15  GeV with the corresponding (maximum) value at ms = 0 , we observe that the SQM stability gradually decreases from about 53 % at V1 = 0 to zero at V1 = 0.33  GeV, as shown in panel (b). On the other hand, if for each value of V1 , we compare the width of the stability window at ms = 0.15  GeV with the one at V1 = 0 (at the same ms = 0.15  GeV), the SQM stability also decreases very rapidly from 100 % at V1 = 0 to zero at V1 = 0.33  GeV (short dashed line). Finally, if for each value of V1 , we compare the width of the stability window at ms = 0.15  GeV with the largest one (at ms = 0 and V1 = 0)  we observe the fastest rate of stability decrease (long dashed line). The relative stabilities are [formula] at [formula] ; [formula] at [formula]  and [formula]  at [formula] . Then, in this aspect, for reasonable values V1 it is unlikely that the strangelets ejected from strange star explosions should survive so long (before they decay) to arrive on Earth or other place of the Galaxy. These results appeared to be in accordance with terrestrial experiments at RHIC which have not confirmed the existence of the SQM nor proved that it does not exists  [\cite=San] [\cite=Abe] [\cite=Ble].

In an investigation relating the gamma-ray bursts to a second explosion after the (first) supernova explosion, it was pointed out that the main difficulties of the model were to explain the causes of the second explosion and the time elapsed between the first explosion and second explosion [\cite=Bom2]. In this regard, another interesting aspect to be considered would be the connection between the anomalous mass defects and stellar instabilities. Merely speculatively, it appears to be reasonable to expect that the greater the magnitude of the anomalous mass defect is, the greater might be the instability of a strange star configuration. Correspondingly, the lower might be the time interval between the first (supernova) explosion and the second (quark-nova) explosion. However, such an investigation should require detailed studies of the internal structure as well as internal processes of the strange stars, that merit to be considered elsewhere, in the author's opinion.

Fig. 6 - Panel (a): SQM stability windows at zero temperature and pressure, bounded by the E / A = 0.9304  GeV (solid) contour of [formula] and its vertical (dashed) line, for different choices of V1 (in GeV units) labeling each contour (cf. panel (a) of  Fig. 3 in Ref. [\cite=Fla2]). Along the horizontal straight (dashed) line, the width of the stability window is the distance from the vertical line to the corresponding E / A contour at a given V1. Panel (b): The relative SQM stability as function of V1 estimated according to three different ways. For each value of V1: (solid line) the width of the stability window at ms = 0.15  GeV divided by the one at ms = 0 (at the same V1); (short dashed line) the width of the stability window at ms = 0.15  GeV divided by the one at V1 = 0 (at the same ms = 0.15  GeV); (long dashed line) the width of the stability window at ms = 0.15  GeV divided by the largest one (at V1 = 0 and ms = 0) .
