Introduction

J. Kaplansky [\cite=lit8] introduced a class of [formula]-algebras to describe [formula]-algebras, which is close to von Neumann algebras by their algebraic and order structure. The class of [formula]-algebras became a subject of many researches in the operator theory (see review in [\cite=lit7]). One of the important results in this direction is the realization of an arbitrary [formula]-algebra M of type I as a [formula]-algebra of all linear bounded operators, which act in a special Banach module over the center Z(M) of the algebra M [\cite=lit9]. The Banach Z(M)-valued norm in this module is generated by the scalar product with values in the commutative [formula]-algebra Z(M). Later, these modules were called Kaplansky-Hilbert modules (KHM). Detailed exposition of many useful properties of KHM is given, for example, in ([\cite=lit5], 7.4). One of the important properties is a representation of an arbitrary Kaplansky-Hilbert module as a direct sum of homogeneous KHM ([\cite=lit10], [\cite=lit5], 7.4.7).

Development of the noncommutative integration theory stimulated an interest to the different classes of algebras of unbounded operators, in particular, to the [formula]-algebras LS(M) of locally measurable operators, affiliated with von Neumann algebras or [formula]-algebras M. If M is a von Neumann algebra, then the center Z(LS(M)) in the algebra LS(M) identifies with the algebra L0(Ω,Σ,μ) of all classes of equal almost everywhere measurable complex functions, defined on some measurable space (Ω,Σ,μ) with a complete locally finite measure μ ([\cite=lit6], 2.1, 2.2). If M is an [formula]-algebra, then Z(LS(M)) is an extended f-algebra C∞(Q), where Q is the Stone compact coresponding to the Boolean algebra of central projectors in M [\cite=lit7]. The problem (like the one in the work of J. Kaplansky [\cite=lit9] for [formula]-algebras) on possibility of realization of [formula]-algebras LS(M), in the case, when M has the type I, as [formula]-algebras of linear L0(Ω,Σ,μ)-bounded (respectively, C∞(Q)-bounded) operators, which act in corresponding KHM over the L0(Ω,Σ,μ) or over the C∞(Q) naturally arises. In order to solve this problem it is necessary to construct corresponding theory of KHM over the algebras L0(Ω,Σ,μ) and C∞(Q). In a particular case of KHM over the algebras L0(Ω,Σ,μ) this problem is solved in [\cite=lit3], where the decomposition of KHM over L0(Ω,Σ,μ) as a direct sum of homogeneous KHM is given. Similar decomposition as a direct sum of strictly γ-homogeneous modules is given in the paper [\cite=lit7a] for arbitrary regular laterally complete modules over the algebra C∞(Q) (the definitions see in the Section 3 below).

The algebra C∞(Q) is an example of a commutative unital regular algebra over the field of real numbers. In this algebra the following property of lateral completeness holds: for any set {ai}i∈I of pairwise disjoint elements in C∞(Q) there exists an element a∈C∞(Q) such that as(ai)  =  ai for all i∈I, where s(ai) is a support of the element ai (the definitions see in the Section 2 below). This property of C∞(Q) plays a crucial role in classification of regular laterally complete C∞(Q)-mpdules [\cite=lit7a]. Thereby, it is natural to consider the class of laterally complete commutative unital regular algebras A over arbitrary fields and to obtain variants of structure theorems for modules over such algebras. Current work is devoted to solving this problem. For every faithful regular laterally complete A-module X the concept of passport Γ(X), which consist of the uniquely defined partition of unity in the Boolean algebra of idempotents in A and the set of pairwise different cardinal numbers is constructed. It is proved, that the equality of passports Γ(X) and Γ(Y) is necessary and sufficient condition for isomorphism of A-modules X and Y.

Laterally complete commutative regular algebras

Let A be a commutative algebra over the field K with the unity [formula] and [formula] be a set of all idempotents in A. For all [formula] we write e  ≤  f if ef = e. It is well known (see, for example [\cite=lit11]) that this binary relation is partial order in [formula] and [formula] is a Boolean algebra with respect to this order. Moreover, we have the following equalities: [formula], [formula], [formula] with respect to the lattice operations and the complement Ce in [formula].

The commutative unital algebra A is called regular if the following equivalent conditions hold [\cite=lit12]:

1. For any a∈A there exists b∈A such that a = a2b;

2. For any a∈A there exists [formula] such that aA = eA.

A regular algebra A is a regular semigroup with respect to the multiplication operation [\cite=lit13]. In this case all idempotents in A commute pairwisely. Therefore, A is a commutative inverse semigroup, i.e. for any a∈A there exists an unique element i(a)∈A, which is an unique solution of the system: a2x = a, ax2 = x [\cite=lit13]. The element i(a) is called an inversion of the element a. Obviously, [formula] for any a∈A. In this case the map i:A  →  A is a bijection and an automorphism (by multiplication) in semigroup A. Moreover, i(i(a)) = a and i(g) = g for all a∈A, [formula].

Let A be a commutative unital regular algebra and [formula] be a Boolean algebra of all idempotents in A. Idempotent [formula] is called the support of an element a∈A if s(a)a = a and ga = a, [formula] imply s(a)  ≤  g. It is clear that s(a) = ai(a) = s(i(a)). In particular, s(e) = ei(e) = e for any [formula].

It is easy to show that supports of elements in a commutative regular unital algebra A satisfy the following properties:

Let a,b∈A, then

(i). s(ab)  =  s(a)s(b), in particular, ab  =  0  ⇔  s(a)s(b)  =  0;

(ii). If ab  =  0, then i(a + b)  =  i(a)  +  i(b) and s(a + b)  =  s(a)  +  s(b).

Two elements a and b in a commutative unital regular algebra A are called disjoint elements, if ab  =  0, which equivalent to the equality s(a)s(b)  =  0 (see Proposition [\ref=art9_utv_2_2] (i)). If the Boolean algebra [formula] of all idempotents in A is complete, a∈A and [formula], then

[formula]

Hence [formula]. If [formula], then aq  =  as(a)q  =  0, thus q  ≤  r(a). This yields that q  =  0, i.e. [formula]. This implies the following

Let A be a commutative unital regular algebra and let [formula] be complete Boolean algebra of idempotents in A. If {ei}i∈I is a partition of unity in [formula], a,b∈A and aei = bei for all i∈I, then a = b.

Since (a - b)ei = 0 for any i∈I, then [formula], i.e. [formula]. Hence, s(a - b) = 0, i.e. a = b.

Commutative unital regular algebra A is called laterally complete (l-complete) if the Boolean algebra of its idempotents is complete and for any set {ai}i∈I of pairwise disjoint elements in A there exists an element a∈A such that as(ai)  =  ai for all i∈I. The element a∈A such that as(ai)  =  ai, i∈I, in general, is not uniquely determined. However, by Proposition [\ref=art9_utv_2_25], it follows that the element a is unique in the case, when [formula]. In general case, due to the equality as(ai)  =  ai  =  bs(ai) for all i∈I and a,b∈A, it follows that a sup i∈Is(ai)  =  b sup i∈Is(ai).

Let us give examples of l-complete and not l-complete commutative regular algebras. Let Δ be an arbitrary set and KΔ be a Cartesian product of Δ copies of the field K, i.e. the set of all K-valued functions on Δ. The set KΔ is a commutative unital regular algebra with respect to pointwise algebraic operations, moreover, the Boolean algebra [formula] of all idempotents in KΔ is an isomorphic atomic Boolean algebra of all subsets in Δ. In particular [formula] is complete Boolean algebra. If {aj = (α(j)q)q∈Δ,j∈J} is a family of pairwise disjoint elements in KΔ, then setting Δj  =  {q∈Δ:α(j)q  ≠  0}, j∈J and a = (αq)q∈Δ∈KΔ, where αq  =  α(j)q for any q∈Δj, j∈J, and αq  =  0 for [formula], we obtain that as(aj)  =  aj for all j∈J. Hence, KΔ is a l-complete algebra.

Now let A be an arbitrary commutative unital regular algebra over the field K and [formula] be a Boolean algebra of all idempotents in A. An element a∈A is called a step element in A if it has the following form [formula], here λk∈K, [formula], [formula]. The set [formula] of all step elements is the smallest subalgebra in A, which contains [formula]. Any nonzero element [formula] in [formula] can be represented as [formula], here [formula], glgk  =  0 when l  ≠  k, 0  ≠  αk∈K, [formula]. Setting [formula], we obtain a2b = a. Hence, [formula] is a regular subalgebra in A. Since [formula], the Boolean algebra of idempotents in [formula] coincides with [formula]. Assume that [formula] and [formula]. We choose a countable set K0  =  {λn}∞n = 1 of pairwise different nonzero elements in K and a countable set {en}∞n = 1 of nonzero pairwise disjoint elements in [formula]. Let us consider a set {λnen}∞n = 1 of pairwise disjoint elements in [formula]. Assume that there exists [formula], 0  ≠  αl∈K, [formula], glgk  =  0 and l  ≠  k, [formula], such that ben = bs(λnen) = λnen. In this case for any positive integer n there exists natural number l(n), such that αl(n)gl(n)en  =  λngl(n)en  ≠  0, i.e. αl(n)  =  λn. This implies that the set {λn}∞n = 1 is finite, which is not true. Hence, the commutative unital regular algebra [formula] is not l-complete.

Let [formula] be complete Boolean algebra and let [formula] be a Stone compact corresponding to [formula]. An algebra [formula] of all continuous functions [formula], taking the values ±    ∞   only on nowhere dense sets in [formula] [\cite=lit5], is an important example of a l-complete commutative regular algebra.

An element [formula] is an idempotent if and only if e(t)  =  χV(t), [formula], for some clopen set [formula], where

[formula]

i.e. χV(t) is a characteristic function of the set V. In particular, the Boolean algebra [formula] can be identified with the Boolean algebra of all idempotents in algebra [formula].

If [formula], then [formula] is open set in the Stone compact set [formula]. Hence, the closure [formula] in [formula] of the set G(a) is an clopen set, i.e. χV(a) is an idempotent in the algebra [formula]. We consider a continuous function b(t), given on the dense open set [formula] and defines by the following equation

[formula]

This function uniquely extends to a continuous function defined on [formula] with values in

[formula]

π: AC(X,K) → AC(X,K)/I(X,K)

[formula]

π(φ) = e = π(φ),

[formula]

Laterally complete regular modules

Let A be a laterally complete commutative regular algebra and let [formula] be a Boolean algebra of all idempotents in A. Let X be a left A-module with algebraic operations x  +  y and ax, x,y∈X, a∈A. Since the algebra A is commutative, then a left A-module X becomes a right A-module, if we put xa: = ax, x∈X, a∈A. Hence, we can assume, that X is a bimodule over A, where the following equality ax  =  xa holds for any x∈X, a∈A. Next, an A-bimodule X we shall call an A-module.

An A-module X is called faithful, if for any nonzero [formula] there exists x∈X such that ex  ≠  0. Clearly, for a faithful A-module X the set Xe: = eX is a faithful Ae-module for any [formula], where Ae: = eA.

An A-module X is said to be a regular module, if for any x∈A the condition ex  =  0  for all [formula] implies ( sup L)x  =  0. In this case, for x∈X the idempotent

[formula]

is called the support of an element x. In case, when X  =  A, the notions of support of an element in an A-module X and of support of an element in A coincide. If X is a regular A-module, then Xe is also a regular Ae-module for any nonzero [formula].

We need the following properties of supports of elements in a regular A-module X.

Let X be a regular A-module, x,y∈X, a∈A. Then

(i). s(x)x  =  x;

(ii). if [formula] and ex  =  x, then e  ≥  s(x);

(iii). s(ax)  =  s(a)s(x).

(i). If [formula], then [formula] and r(x)x  =  0. Hence, x  =  (s(x)  +  r(x))x  =  s(x)x.

(ii). As ex  =  x, then [formula], and therefore [formula]. Thus [formula].

(iii). Since (s(a)s(x))  ·  (ax)  =  (s(a)a)  ·  (s(x)x)  =  ax, then by (ii) we have s(ax)  ≤  s(a)s(x). If g  =  s(a)s(x)  -  s(ax)  ≠  0, then ga  ≠  0, g  ≤  s(a) and gs(ax) = 0. Hence gax  =  0 and 0  =  i(ga)(gax)  =  (i(g)i(a)ga)x  =  (gi(a)a)x  =  gs(a)x  =  gx  ≠  0. This contradiction implies g  =  0, i.e. s(ax)  =  s(a)s(x).

We say that a regular  A-module  X  is laterally complete  (l-complete), if for any set   {xi}i∈I  ⊂  X  and for any partition {ei}i∈I of unity of the Boolean algebra [formula] there exists x∈X such that eix  =  eixi for all i∈I. In this case, the element x is called mixing of the set {xi}i∈I with respect to the partition of unity {ei}i∈I and denote by [formula]. Mixing [formula] is defined uniquely, whereas the equalities eix  =  eixi  =  eiy, x,y∈X, i∈I, implies ei(x  -  y)  =  0 for all i∈I, and, by regularity of the A-module X, we obtain x  =  y.

Let {xi}i∈I  ⊂  E  ⊂  X and let {ei}i∈I be a partition of unity in [formula]. The set of all mixings [formula] is called a cyclic hull of the set E in X and denotes by [formula]. Obviously, the inclusion [formula] is always true. If [formula], then E is called a cyclic set in X (compare with [\cite=lit4], 1.1.2).

Thus, a regular A-module X is a l-complete A-module if and only if X is a cyclic set. In particular, in any l-complete A-module X its submodule Xe is also a l-complete Ae-module for any nonzero idempotent e in A.

We need the following properties of cyclic hulls of sets.

Let X be a l-complete A-module and let E be a nonempty subset in X, a∈A. Then

(i). [formula];

(ii). [formula];

(iii). If Y is an A-submodule in X, then [formula] is a l-complete A-submodule in X;

(iv). If U is an isomorphism from A-module X onto A-module Z, then Z is a l-complete A-module and [formula].

(i). It is sufficient to show that [formula]. If [formula], then [formula], where [formula], i∈I. Since [formula], then [formula], where x(i)j∈E, j∈J(i) and {e(i)j}j∈J(i) is a partition of unity in the Boolean algebra [formula] for all i∈I. Fix i∈I and put g(i)j: = eie(i)j. It is clear that {g(i)j}j∈J(i) is a partition of the idempotent ei. Hence, {g(i)j}j∈J(i),i∈I is a partition of unity [formula]. Besides,

[formula]

This yields that [formula].

(ii). If [formula], then [formula], where yi∈E,i∈I. Since X is a l-complete A-module, then there exists [formula] and eix  =  aeiyi  =  ei(ay) for all i∈I. Hence, ei(x  -  ay)  =  0, and regularity of the A-module X implies the equality x  =  ay. Thus, [formula].

Conversely, if [formula], then x  =  az, where [formula]. Since azi∈aE and eix  =  ei(az)  =  eiaeiz  =  ei(azi) for all i∈I, we have that [formula]. Hence, [formula].

(iii). Let [formula], [formula], [formula], where xi,yj∈Y, i∈I, j∈J, {ei}i∈I, {gj}j∈J are partitions of unity in [formula]. Clearly, that pij  =  eigj, i∈I, j∈J, is also a partition of unity in [formula] and pij(x + y) = pij(xi + yj), where xi  +  yj∈Y for all i∈I, j∈J. This means that [formula].

Since aY  ⊂  Y, then by (ii) we have that [formula]. Hence, [formula] is an A-submodule in X, and by regularity of the A-module X, it is a regular A-module. The equality [formula] (see (i)) implies that [formula] is a l-complete A-module.

(iv). If U(x)  =  y∈Z, x∈X, [formula] and ey  =  0 for all e∈L, then U(ex)  =  eU(x)  =  ey  =  0. Since U is a bijection, then ex  =  0 for any e∈L. By regularity of the A-module X, we have that ( sup L)x  =  0, and, therefore, ( sup L)y  =  U(( sup L)x)  =  0. Hence, Z is a regular A-module. In the same way we show that Z is a l-complete A-module and the equality [formula] holds.

Let [formula] be an arbitrary complete Boolean algebra. For any nonzero element [formula] we put [formula]. The set [formula] is a Boolean algebra with the unity e with respect to partial order, induced from [formula].

We say that a set B in [formula] is a minorant subset for nonempty set [formula], if for any nonzero e∈E there exists nonzero q∈B such that q  ≤  e. We need the following property of complete Boolean algebras.

If [formula] is a complete Boolean algebra, e is a nonzero element in [formula] and B is a minorant subset for [formula], then there exists a disjoint subset L  ⊂  B such that sup L  =  e.

We say that a Boolean algebra [formula] has a countable type or is σ-finite, if any nonfinite family of nonzero pairwise disjoint elements in [formula] is a countable set. A complete Boolean algebra [formula] is called multi-σ-finite, if for any nonzero element [formula] there exists [formula] such that e  ≤  g and the Boolean algebra [formula] has a countable type. By theorem [\ref=art9_teor_2_1], a multi-σ-finite Boolean algebra [formula] always has a partition {ei}i∈I of unity [formula] such that the Boolean algebra [formula] has a countable type for all i∈I.

By theorem [\ref=art9_teor_2_1] we set the following useful properties of l-complete A-modules.

Let X be an arbitrary l-complete A-module and [formula] be a complete Boolean algebra of all idempotents in A. Then

(i). If X is a faithful A-module, then there exists an element x∈X such that [formula];

(ii). If Y is a l-complete A-submodule in a regular A-module X and for any nonzero [formula] there exists a nonzero [formula] such that ge  ≤  e and geY  =  geX, then Y  =  X.

Proof is in the same way as the proof of Proposition 2.4 in [\cite=lit7a].

We need a representation of a faithful l-complete A-module X as the Cartesian product of a faithful l-complete Aei-modules family, where {ei}i∈I is a partition of unity in the Boolean algebra [formula] of all idempotents in A. In the Cartesian product

[formula]

of A-submodules eiX we consider coordinate-wise algebraic operations. It is clear that [formula] is a faithful l-complete A-module. We define a map [formula] given by U(x)  =  {eix}i∈I. Obviously, U is a homomorphizm from X onto [formula]. If U(x)  =  U(y), then eix  =  eiy for all i∈I, and by regularity of the A-module X, it follows that x  =  y.

If [formula], where xi∈eiX  ⊂  X, i∈I, then l-completeness of the A-module X implies that there exists an element x∈X such that eix  =  eixi  =  xi for all i∈I. Hence, U(x)  =  z, i.e. U is a surjection.

Thus, the following proposition holds.

If X is a faithful l-complete A-module, {ei}i∈I is a partition of unity of the Boolean algebra [formula] of all idempotents in A, then [formula] is also a faithful l-complete A-module and U is an isomorphism from X onto [formula].

Homogenous A-modules

Let A be a laterally complete commutative regular algebra, let [formula] be a complete Boolean algebra of all idempotents in A, let X be a faithful A-module. The following A-submodule in X is called A-linear hull of a nonempty subset Y  ⊂  A

[formula]

where N is the set of all natural numbers. If X is a l-complete A-module, then by proposition [\ref=art9_utv_2_6] (iii), [formula] is also a l-complete A-submodule in X.

A set {xi}i∈I in an A-module X is called A-linearly independent, if for any [formula], [formula], n∈N, the equality [formula] implies equalities [formula].

If [formula] is a finite A-linearly independent subset in a l-complete A-module X, then [formula].

It is sufficient to show the  following  inclusion  [formula].  Let  [formula],   {ei}i∈I  be a partition of unity in the Boolean algebra  [formula]  and let   [formula] be such that eix  =  eiyi for all i∈I. Since [formula], then [formula] for some a(i)j∈A, [formula]. Hence, [formula]. Since A is a l-complete commutative regular algebra and {ei}i∈I is a partition of unity in [formula], then there exists a unique element βj∈A such that eiβj  =  eia(i)j for all i∈I, where [formula]. Thus, [formula] for any i∈I, and this implies the equality [formula].

We say that an A-linearly independent system {xi}i∈I from a l-complete A-module X is A-Hamel basis, if

[formula]

In the case when an A-Hamel basis is a finite set, we say that it is an A-basis in X.

If {xi}ni = 1, {yj}kj = 1 are A-basises in an A-module X, then n = k.

First we shall show the following A-variant of one known fact from the linear algebra.

Let [formula] for nonzero [formula]. If the set [formula] is Ae-linearly independent, then k  ≤  n.

We use the mathematical induction. Let us suppose that for n = 1, k  >  1 the equalities [formula] hold, where ai∈Ae, [formula]. Since a2ey1  +  ( - a1)ey2  =  0, then ea1  =  ea2  =  0, i.e. ey1  =  ey2  =  0, this contradicts to Ae-linear independence of the elements ey1 and ey2. Hence, k = 1.

Now assume that the lemma holds for n = l - 1. Let {zi}li = 1  ⊂  X and the following equalities hold

[formula]

Let aj0lexl  ≠  0 for some [formula]. By reindexing {yj}kj = 1, we can assume that aklexl  ≠  0, in particular p  =  s(akle)  ≠  0, wherein p  ≤  e. Since the set {eyj}kj = 1 is Ae-linearly independent, then the set {pyj}kj = 1 is Ap-linearly independent, wherein, by [\eqref=lemma_sfdm2_8_eq_1], we have

[formula]

Since A is a regular algebra, then for the inversion h  =  i(akl)∈A the equality hakl  =  s(akl) holds. Therefore the following equality

[formula]

implies

[formula]

Substitute pzl from [\eqref=lemma_sfdm2_8_eq_3] in the first (k - 1) equalities from [\eqref=lemma_sfdm2_8_eq_2] and collect similar terms, we obtain

[formula]

for some βji∈Ap, [formula], [formula].

Let us show that the elements uj  =  pyj  -  hajlpyk, [formula] are Ap-linearly independent. Let

[formula]

where γj∈Ap, [formula]. Since {pyj}kj = 1 is Ap-linearly independent, then [formula], i.e. the set {uj}k - 1j = 1 is Ap-linearly independent in pX. By the assumption of the mathematical induction we have that k - 1  ≤  l - 1, and thus k  ≤  l. The Lemma [\ref=art9_lemma_3_3] is proved.

Return to the proof of Theorem [\ref=art9_teor_4_2a]. As {xi}ni = 1 is an A-basis in X, then by Proposition [\ref=art9_utv_3_3] we obtain that [formula]. On the other hand, {yj}kj = 1  ⊂  X and {yj}kj = 1 is an A-linearly independent set. Therefore, by Lemma [\ref=art9_lemma_3_3] it follows that k  ≤  n.

Similarly, we show that n  ≤  k, and thus n = k.

Next we need the following characterization of A-Hamel basises.

For an A-linearly independent set {xi}i∈I in a l-complete A-module X the following conditions are equivalent:

(i). {xi}i∈I is an A-Hamel basis;

(ii). For any x∈X and any nonzero idempotent e∈A there exists a nonzero idempotent g  ≤  e, such that [formula].

(i)  ⇒  (ii). If [formula], then for x∈X there exists a partition {ej}j∈J of unity, such that [formula]. Since [formula], then for [formula] there exists an element j0∈J such that g  =  ej0e  ≠  0, wherein [formula].

(ii)  ⇒  (i). Fix 0  ≠  x∈X and for any nonzero idempotent [formula] choose a nonzero idempotent g(e,x)  ≤  e such that [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=art9_teor_2_1], there exists a set {qj}j∈J of pairwise disjoint idempotents in A such that [formula] and [formula] for all j∈J. This means that [formula], which implies the equality [formula].

Fix some cardinal number γ. A faithful l-complete A-module X is called γ-homogeneous, if there exists an A-Hamel basis {xi}i∈I in X with [formula]. We say that A-module X homogeneous, if it is a γ-homogeneous A-module for some cardinal number γ.

If X is a γ-homogeneous A-module, then obviously, eX is also γ-homogeneous Ae-module for any nonzero idempotent e∈A. Besides, by Proposition [\ref=art9_utv_2_6] (iv) it follows that, if A-module Y is isomorphic to a γ-homogeneous A-module X, then Y is also a γ-homogeneous module.

By repeating the proof of Theorem 3.8 from [\cite=lit7a], we establish the following proposition on isomorphisms of γ-homogeneous A-modules.

If X and Y are γ-homogeneous A-modules, then X and Y are isomorphic.

Let us give examples of γ-homogeneous A-modules for an arbitrary cardinal number γ and for any l-complete commutative regular untaly algebra A. Consider an arbitrary set of indexes I with [formula]. Since the algebra A is l-complete, then the Cartesian product

[formula]

is a l-complete A-module with coordinate-wise algebraic operations.

For any j∈I consider an element   =  {g(j)i}i∈I from Y, where g(j)i  =  0, i  ≠  j and [formula], i∈I. Clearly, that the set {}j∈I is A-linearly independent, and, therefore, the A-submodule [formula] in Y is a γ-homogeneous A-module.

If γ is a positive integer n, then for the faithful l-complete A-module [formula] and for   =  {g(j)i}ni = 1, [formula] we have that [formula], i.e. the set {ĝj}nj = 1 is an A-Hamel basis in Y. Thus, Proposition [\ref=art9_teor_3_13a] implies the following

For any positive integer n there exists a unique, up to isomorphism, n-homogeneous A-module, which is isomorphic to An.

Let X be a faithful l-complete A-module, which is γ-homogeneous and λ-homogeneous simultaneously. There is a natural question, whether in this case the equality γ  =  λ holds. Similar question was studied in classification of Kaplansky-Hilbert modules (KHM) X over a commutative [formula]-algebra A with the Boolean algebra of projections [formula] (see [\cite=lit10]). In the case, when [formula] is a multi-σ-finite Boolean algebra in [\cite=lit10] it is proved that for a KHM X the equality λ  =  γ is always true. However, for an arbitrary complete Boolean algebra [formula] this equality cannot be established. Thereby, in ([\cite=lit5], 7.4.6) the notion of strictly γ-homogeneous KHM X is defined, and this gave an opportunity to classify KHM X over an arbitrary commutative [formula]-algebra A. For the same reason, below we introduce the notion of strictly γ-homogeneous faithful l-complete modules over laterally complete algebras A. With this notion we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for l-complete A-modules to be isomorphic.

Let X be a faithful l-complete A-module, [formula]. By κ(e)  =  κX(e) we denote the smallest cardinal number γ such that the Ae-module Xe is γ-homogeneous. If the A-module X is homogeneous, then the cardinal number κ(e) is defined for all nonzero [formula]. Further, by ([\cite=lit5], 7.4.7), we assume that κ(0)  =  0.

We say that an A-module X is strictly γ-homogeneous (compare with [\cite=lit5], 7.4.6), if X is γ-homogeneous and γ  =  κ(e) for all nonzero [formula]. If an A-module X is strictly γ-homogeneous for some cardinal number γ, then such A-module X is called strictly homogeneous.

Clearly, any strictly γ-homogeneous A-module is a γ-homogeneous A-module. By Lemma [\ref=art9_lemma_3_3] it follows that every n-homogeneous A-module X is a strictly n-homogeneous module. By Proposition [\ref=art9_utv_2_6] (iv) every A-module Y, which is isomorphic to a strictly γ-homogeneous A-module X, is also strictly γ-homogeneous.

The following theorem holds.

Let λ and γ be infinite cardinal numbers and let the Boolean algebra [formula] of all idempotents in a l-complete commutative regular algebra A has countable type. If a faithful l-complete A-module X is λ-homogeneous and γ-homogeneous simultaneously, then γ  =  λ.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=art9_teor_3_9] is similar to that of Theorem 3.4 in [\cite=lit7a].

Using Theorem [\ref=art9_teor_3_9] to the Ae-module Xe, we have, that Theorem [\ref=art9_teor_3_9] holds in the case, when in the Boolean algebra [formula] of idempotents in A there exists nonzero element e, which has a countable type. Thus, repeating the proof of Corollary 3.7 in [\cite=lit7a], we obtain the following necessary and sufficient conditions for coincidence of strictly γ-homogeneous and γ-homogeneous notions for A-modules.

Let a Boolean algebra [formula] of all idempotents on a l-complete commutative regular algebra A be multi-σ-finite. If γ is an infinite cardinal number and X is a γ-homogeneous A-module, then the module X is strictly γ-homogeneous.

Let A be a l-complete commutative regular algebra, let X be a l-complete A-module and let {ei}i∈I be a set of pairwise disjoint nonzero idempotents in A and [formula]. If Xei is a γ-homogeneous (respectively, strictly γ-homogeneous) Aei-module for all i∈I, then the Ae-module Xe is also γ-homogeneous (respectively, strictly γ-homogeneous).

Proof is similar to that of Proposition 3.10 in [\cite=lit7a].

Classification of faithful l-complete A-modules

In this section it is proved that every faithful laterally complete A-module is isomorphic to a Cartesian product of strictly homogeneous A-modules. The important step in obtaining such an isomorphism is the following theorem.

Let A be a l-complete commutative regular algebra, let [formula] be a Boolean algebra of all idempotents in A and let X be a faithful l-complete A-module. Then there exists a nonzero idempotent [formula] such that Xp is a strictly homogeneous Ap-module.

Using Proposition [\ref=art9_utv_2_7] (i), we choose x0∈X such that [formula]. If [formula], then X is a strictly 1-homogeneous module and Theorem [\ref=art9_teor_5_1] is proved.

Assume that [formula]. We consider in X the following nonempty family of subsets

[formula]

We introduce in [formula] a partial order by B  ≤  C  ⇔  B  ⊂  C. By Zorn's lemma there exists maximal element D in [formula]. If D is an A-Hamel basis in X, then X is [formula]-homogeneous A-module.

Assume that [formula]. If for any nonzero [formula] there exists [formula] such that [formula], then from Proposition [\ref=art9_utv_2_6] (iii) and Proposition [\ref=art9_utv_2_7] (ii) it follows that [formula], which contradicts our assumption. Hence, there exists nonzero [formula] such that the following condition holds:

[formula]

Denote by [formula] a set of all nonzero [formula] with property (1). Put [formula] and show that the equality [formula] fails.

Assume that [formula]. In this case for every nonzero [formula] there exists [formula] such that g  =  qe  ≠  0. Hence, [formula] (see (1)), which implies

[formula]

Show that for any nonzero [formula] there exists a nonzero idempotent r  ≤  q such that for any [formula] the following property holds:

[formula]

If this is not true, then there exists a nonzero [formula] such that for every [formula] there exists a nonzero idempotent [formula] without property (3), i.e. for any x∈grX with s(x)  =  gr there exists a nonzero idempotent  e(xg,r)  ≤  gr  ≤  q  such that

[formula]

Thus, for every nonzero [formula] there exists a nonzero idempotent r  ≤  q such that for any [formula] property (3) holds.

Again by Theorem [\ref=art9_teor_2_1], we choose a partition {gj}j∈J of the idempotent r and a set {xgj}j∈J in rX, such that s(xgj)  =  gj and [formula] for all [formula].

Since rX is a l-complete Ar-module, then there exists x∈rX such that gjx  =  xgj. In particular, s(x)  =  r, wherein [formula] for all [formula].

Again by Theorem [\ref=art9_teor_2_1] we choose a partition {rk}k∈K of the unity [formula] in the Boolean algebra [formula] and a set {xk}k∈K in X, such that s(xk)  =  rk and [formula] for any [formula]. By l-completeness of the A-module X there exists x̂∈X such that rkx̂  =  xk for all k∈K. In this case [formula] and [formula] for any [formula].

Show that the set [formula] is A-linearly independent. Let [formula], where a0,ai∈A, xi∈D, [formula]. If a0  =  0, then [formula] and by A-linear independence of the set D it follows that ai  =  0 for all [formula]. If a0  ≠  0, then s(a0)  ≠  0 and for i(a0) = h∈A we have that ha0  =  s(a0) and [formula], which is not true. Hence, the set [formula] is A-linearly independent in X, which contradicts to maximality of the set D.

Thus the equality [formula] is impossible. This means that [formula]. By construction of the idempotent e0, every nonzero idempotent r  ≤  e does not have property (1). Hence, for any [formula] there exists a nonzero idempotent pr  ≤  r such that

[formula]

From Propositions [\ref=art9_utv_2_6] (iii) and [\ref=art9_utv_2_7] (ii) it follows that

[formula]

Since eD is an Ae-linearly independent subset in the Ae-module eX, then eD is an Ae-basis in eX, i.e. eX is a γ-homogeneous Ae-module, where [formula]. In particular, a cardinal number κ(p) is defined for all nonzero [formula]. Let γe be the smallest cardinal number in the set of cardinal numbers {κ(p):0  ≠  p  ≤  e}, i.e. γe  =  κ(p) for some nonzero p  ≤  e. By the choice of the idempotent p it follows that γe  =  κ(p)  =  κ(q) for all [formula]. This means that the Ap-module Xp is strictly homogeneous.

Now everything is ready to obtain the isomorphism from the faithful laterally complete A-module to the Cartesian product of strictly homogeneous A-modules.

Let A be a l-complete commutative regular algebra, let [formula] be a Boolean algebra of all idempotents in A and let X be a faithful l-complete A-module. Then there exist a uniquely defined set of pairwise disjoint nonzero idempotents [formula] and a set of pairwise different cardinal numbers {γi}i∈I such that [formula] and Xei is a strictly γi-homogeneous Aei-module for all i∈I. In this case, the A-modules X and [formula] are isomorphic.

By Theorem [\ref=art9_teor_5_1] for every nonzero idempotent e∈A there exists a nonzero idempotent g  ≤  e such that Xg is a strictly homogeneous Ag-module. By Theorem [\ref=art9_teor_2_1], choose a set of pairwise disjoint nonzero idempotents {qj}j∈J such that [formula] and qjX is a strictly λj-homogeneous Aqj-module for all j∈J. We decompose the set of cardinal numbers A  =  {λj}j∈J as a union of disjoint subsets Ai in such a way that every Ai consists of equal cardinal numbers from A. By γi denote an element in Ai. By Proposition [\ref=art9_utv_4_9a], for ei  =   sup {qj:λj∈Ai} we have that the Aei-module Xei is strictly γi-homogeneous. Moreover, by Proposition [\ref=art9_utv_2_8], the A-module X and [formula] are isomorphic.

Assume, that there exist other sets of pairwise disjoint nonzero idempotents {gj}j∈J and pairwise different cardinal numbers {μj}j∈J, such that [formula] and Xgj is a strictly μj-homogeneous Agj-module for all j∈J. For any fixed j∈J, by the equality [formula], we have that [formula]. If there exist two different indexes i1,i2∈I such that ei1gj  ≠  0 and ei2pj  ≠  0, then

[formula]

By this contradiction, it follows that eigj  =  0 for all i∈I except one index, which we denote by i(j). Since ei(j)gj  ≠  0, we have that

[formula]

If gj  ≠  ei(j), then by the equality [formula], there exists index j1∈J, j1  ≠  j such that ei(j)gj1  ≠  0. Hence,

[formula]

which is not true. Thus, gj  =  ei(j) and μj  =  γi(j).

For the same reason, for any i∈I there exists the unique index j(i) such that ei  =  gj(i) and γi  =  μj(i).

The partition {ei}i∈I of unity in a Boolean algebra of idempotents in A and the set of cardinal numbers {γi}i∈I in Theorem [\ref=art9_teor_5_2] are called a passport for a faithful laterally complete A-module X and denoted by Γ(X)  =  {(ei(X),γi(X))}i∈I(X).

Thus, a passport Γ(X)  =  {(ei(X),γi(X))}i∈I(X) for a faithful l-complete A-module X means that [formula] (up to an isomorphism), where ei(X)X is a strictly γi(X)-homogeneous Aei-module for all i∈I(X), ei(X)  ≠  0, ei(X)ej(X)  =  0, γi(X)  ≠  γj(X), i  ≠  j, i,j∈I(X), [formula].

The following theorem gives a criterion for isomorphism between faithful l-complete A-modules, by using the notion of passport for these A-modules.

Let A be a l-complete commutative regular algebra, X and Y be a faithful l-complete A-modules. The following conditions are equivalent:

(i) Γ(X)  =  Γ(Y);

(ii) A-modules X and Y are isomorphic.

Let A be a l-complete commutative regular algebra, let [formula] be a Boolean algebra of all idempotents in A. A faithful l-complete A-module X is called finitely-dimensional, if there exist a finite partition {ei}ki = 1 of unity in the Boolean algebra [formula] ([formula] and a finite set {ni}ki = 1 of natural numbers ([formula]) such that Xei is an ni-homogeneous Aei-module for all [formula].

This means that any finitely-dimensional A-module X has a passport of the following form

[formula]

where

[formula]

For a faithful l-complete A-module X the following conditions are equivalent:

(i). X is a finitely-dimensional module;

(ii). X is a finitely-generated module, i.e. there exists a finite set {xi}mi = 1 of elements in X such that [formula];

(iii). There exists a positive integer m such that for any nonzero idempotent e∈A any Ae-linearly independent set in Xe consists of not more than m elements.

(i)  ⇒  (ii). Let Γ(X)  =  {(ei(X),ni(X))}ki = 1 be a passport for the A-module X. For every [formula] we choose the Aei-basis {x(i)j}nij = 1 in Xei. If x∈X, then [formula], where a(i)j∈Aei. Hence,

[formula]

This means that A-module X is finitely-generated.

(ii)  ⇒  (iii). If [formula], e is a nonzero idempotent in A and {yj}lj = 1 is an Ae-linearly independent set in Xe, then by Lemma [\ref=art9_lemma_3_3], it follows that l  ≤  m.

(iii)  ⇒  (i). By Theorem [\ref=art9_teor_5_2], there exist a set of pairwise disjoint nonzero idempotents {ei}i∈I and a set of pairwise different cardinal numbers {γi}i∈I such that [formula] and Xei is a strictly γi-homogeneous Aei-module for all i∈I. If γi  >  m, then in Xei there exists a finite set {xi}li = 1, which consist of Ae-linearly independent elements, and besides l  >  m, which contradicts to condition (iii). Hence, γi  ≤  m for all i∈I. Since natural numbers {γi}i∈I are pairwise different, then I is a finite set, i.e. {γi}i∈I  =  {ni}ki = 1, where [formula]. Hence, the A-module X is finitely-dimensional.

The following description of finitely-dimensional A-modules follows directly from Theorem [\ref=art9_teor_5_2] and Corollary [\ref=art9_teor_3_14].

If X is a finitely-dimensional A-module, then there exist an uniquely defined finite partition {ei}ki = 1 of unity in the Boolean algebra of all idempotents in A and a finite set of positive integers [formula] such that the A-module X is isomorphic to the A-module [formula] (here ei  ≠  0 for all [formula]).

A faithful l-complete A-module X is called σ-finitely-dimensional, if there exist a countable partition {ei}∞i = 1 of unity in the Boolean algebra of all idempotents in A ([formula]) and a countable set {ni}∞i = 1 of positive integers ([formula]) such that Xei is an ni-homogeneous Aei-module for all [formula]

By Theorem [\ref=art9_teor_5_2] and Corollary [\ref=art9_teor_3_14] we obtain the following description of σ-finitely-dimensional A-modules.

If X is a σ-finitely-dimensional A-module, then there exist a uniquely defined countable partition {ei}∞i = 1 of unity in the Boolean algebra of all idempotents in A and a countable set of positive integers [formula] such that the A-module X is isomorphic to the A-module [formula] (here ei  ≠  0 for all [formula]).
