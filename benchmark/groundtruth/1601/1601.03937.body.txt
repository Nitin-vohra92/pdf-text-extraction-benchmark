Stability and instability of a random multiple access model with adaptive energy harvesting

Introduction

Nowadays the idea of usage of energy harvesting in communication systems is of a common interest, due to many applications. For example, sensor networks with rechargeable batteries that are harvesting energy from the environment can significantly extend the lifetime of the system. Another example of using energy harvesting was introduced in [\cite=XRC], where the authors considered a multi-user system with the base station that employs technology OFDM and a wireless channel to transmit both data and energy to its users. Usage of an energy harvesting mechanism in systems with the random multiple access presents new challenges and, particularly, in determining their stability regions. In [\cite=Ephr], the authors considered a model with a decentralised energy harvesting mechanism, with assuming individual power supplies for a finite number of transmitting nodes, and studied their stability properties. In this paper, we consider another model (see fig. 1) with infinite number of transmitters and separate power supplies per each transmitting node (with certain limitations on the intensity of supply) and examine its stability and instability. Earlier (see [\cite=sib] and fig. 2), we considered random multiple access models with a common (centralised) renewable power supply and infinite number of transmitters. We proved that an additional energy limitation on a common energy supply may stabilise the system. At the same time, the model from [\cite=sib] is simplistic and far from the practice (in comparison with that from [\cite=Ephr]). On the other hand, if one considers infinite number of users in the model of [\cite=Ephr], the system may lose stability.

Recall that the classical ALOHA (see, e.g., [\cite=Abr]) algorithm is always unstable in the system with infinitely many users, and has a non-empty stability region if the number of users is finite.

In this paper, we study a model with infinite number of transmitters/users having individual power supplies, and with energy harvesting mechanism with intensity that depends on the number of active transmitters. We are interested in conditions on the energy harvesting algorithm for (in)stability of the model.

The model

This is a system with a single transmission channel and messages that arrive and then depart after a successful transmission. Time is slotted, with ξn being the number of messages that arrive within time slot

[formula]

Main results

We say that the system is stable if the underlying Markov chain is positive recurrent, and unstable if qn + vn  →    ∞   in probability, as n  →    ∞  .

To analyse the (in)stability of (qn,vn), we introduce an auxiliary one-dimensional Markov chain [formula] by the following recursion:

[formula]

where {ηn}∞n = 0 is an i.i.d. sequence of Poisson random variables with parameter c. One can easily apply the classical Foster criterion and condition [formula] to conclude that this Markov chain is ergodic: it admits a unique stationary distribution, say π (see, e.g.,[\cite=Tak]) and converges to it in the total variation norm, for any initial value [formula]. Further, note that π is a Poisson distribution with parameter c / p and that the Markov chain is geometrically ergodic, i.e. its distribution converges to the stationary one geometrically fast - see Lemma 1 below.

Let a random variable [formula] have the distribution π and do not depend on anything else. Then random variable [formula] has a Poisson distribution with parameter c and [formula]

If, for some c > 0,

[formula]

then the stochastic system described by the 2-dimensional Markov chain

[formula]

is stable if λ  <  ce- c and unstable if λ  >  ce- c.

The origin (0,0) is achievable from all other states [formula] of the 2-dimensional Markov chain (vn,qn). Since [formula], the Markov chain is aperiodic. Therefore, if the Markov chain is positive recurrent, it is also ergodic: there is a stationary distribution, say φ, on [formula] such that, for any initial value (q0,v0), the distribution of (qn,vn) converges to φ in the total variation norm:

[formula]

The stability condition attains its maximum value e- 1 for c = 1 and doesn't depend on parameter p.

More or less straightforward modifications of the proof of Theorem 1 lead to the following results. If, instead of [\eqref=star], we assume that

[formula]

then the system is similar to the classical ALOHA, which is unstable. On the other hand, if we assume that

[formula]

then the system is unstable again as it does not have enough energy to transmit the "old" messages.

Auxiliary lemma

We summarise a number of simple, but important properties in the following lemma.

Let {Zn} be an i.i.d. sequence of non-negative integer-valued random variables with finite mean [formula]. Assume it does not depend on i.i.d. random variables {Un,i,  -    ∞    <  n  <    ∞  ,i  ≥  1} having the uniform-(0,1) distribution. (I) For any initial value W0 and for any p∈(0,1), the sequence

[formula]

is ergodic. (II) For m  ≤  n define operators

[formula]

and note that random variable Dm:n(k,1 - p) has a binomial distribution with parameters k and (1 - p)n - m + 1. Then a stationary sequence {W(n)} given by

[formula]

has finite mean [formula] and forms a stationary solution to recursive equation [\eqref=WW],

[formula]

(III) Let Q be the distribution of W(0). Then, for any initial value W0,

[formula]

and, in particular,

[formula]

In particular, if W0 and Z0 have finite exponential moments, then

[formula]

for some K1,K2 > 0 and for all N  ≥  0. (IV) For any n  ≥  0,

[formula]

and

[formula]

(V) Let [formula] be any other sequence of non-negative and integer-valued random variables, such that [formula] a.s., for all n. Consider a recursion

[formula]

with integer initial value [formula]. Then

[formula]

(VI) In particular, when Z0 is a Poisson random variable with parameter c, formula [\eqref=defW] and the splitting and composition theorems imply that every W(n) has Poisson distribution with parameter c / p.

The proof of all statements of the lemma is straightforward. First, we verify that the right-hand side of [\eqref=defW] is finite. This follows from finiteness of [formula] since expectation of the sum of non-negative random variables always equals to the sum of expectations, and

[formula]

Therefore, the sum in the right-hand side of [\eqref=defW] must contain only finite number of non-zero elements. Further, if [formula] is finite for some K0 > 0, then, for K∈(0,K0),

[formula]

where all terms in the right product are finite and, as [formula] and uniformly in n,

[formula]

so the product is finite too. Indeed, for any h > 0,

[formula]

and then

[formula]

Then one can take h = (eK - 1)(1 - p)n and note that eK - 1 = K(1 + o(1)), as [formula].

Next, at any time n, we have a set of Wn elements, each of which disappears at time (n + 1) with probability p, independently of everything else, while Zn new elements arrive. Then the original W0 elements disappear in a (random) finite time, say T, and after that all Wn include only new items that arrive after time 0. Further, if [formula] is finite for some K0 > 0, then, for k sufficienly small and uniformly in n,

[formula]

for some [formula] and for any [formula] Similar observations hold for W(n): all elements of W(0) leave by finite time, say T̂, which has a finite exponential moment if Z0 does. Therefore Wn and W(n) coincide after time max (T,T̂)  ≤  T + T̂ which also has a finite exponential moment.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=t_1]

We start with the proof of stability. Let [formula].

By the generalised Foster criterion (see, e.g., [\cite=Tak]), it is enough to find a test ("Lyapunov") function L(x)  ≥  0 and a (sufficiently large) positive integer N0 such that the set

[formula]

is compact and, for a properly chosen positive and bounded from above integer-valued function g(x), the Markov chain has a bounded mean drift on D,

[formula]

and the drift is uniformly negative on the complement Dc of D: for any x∈Dc,

[formula]

where ε is a fixed positive constant. We choose the test ("Lyapunov") function L by

[formula]

and then a proper choice of function g(x) leads to the stability result.

Note that since

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

the drift () is bounded from above on the set D, for any choice of constant N0.

Recall that v0  ≤  q0, so if we choose N0 such that [formula], then q0  >  c for X0∈Dc. Therefore, the drift () is uniformly negative for g(x) = 1 for all (q0,v0)∈Dc, such that [formula]

Now we complete the stability proof, with choosing sufficiently large values of N0 and k such that, with [formula], inequality [\eqref=ccc] uniformly holds for all x = (q0,v0)∈Dc such that [formula].

Let {Yn} be i.i.d. random variables that do not depend on {ξn} and have distribution

[formula]

By Chernoff's inequality, for x  ≥  c and any α > 0, the right-hand side of the latter equality does not exceed

[formula]

where C1 is finite since [formula] as q  →    ∞  . Therefore the distribution of Y1 is proper and, moreover, has a finite exponential moment. Let now

[formula]

Then, by property (V) of Lemma 1,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Next, choose δ > 0 such that λ  +  δ  <  ce- c and consider the auxiliary Markov chain [formula]. Since it is ergodic, for given δ > 0 and R: = (c + λ + 1) / p (we assume R to be an integer), there exists [formula] such that, for any n  ≥  l,

[formula]

Then we choose k > l such that

[formula]

Now choose C3 so large that, for the sequence {Wn} defined in [\eqref=ZYW] and with initial value W0 = R, the probability of event

[formula]

is not smaller than 1 - δ / 3.

The famous Poisson theorem allows the following simple extension: as q  →    ∞  , the distribution of random variable B1(q - v + ξ1,c / q) converges in the total variation norm to the Poisson distribution with parameter c, uniformly in all [formula]. Therefore, one can choose [formula] such that the total probability distance between the distribution of B1(q - v + ξ1,c / q) and Poisson distribution with parameter c does not exceed δ / 3, for all q  ≥  .

Finally, let N0  =   + k + R. For any (q0,v0) with q0 + v0  ≥  N0 and v0  ≤  R, we have qi  ≥   for all 0  ≤  i  ≤  k, since qi + 1  ≥  qi - 1 a.s. Then we may put all bounds together to conclude that, under the assumptions from above, for any [formula],

[formula]

and, therefore, [\eqref=ccc] holds. Indeed, with x = (q0,v0) where q0 + v0  ≥  N0 and v0  ≤  R, we have

[formula]

where ε is from [\eqref=vareps]. This completes the proof of the stability part of the theorem.

The proof of the second part of the theorem is based on Theorem 2.1 from [\cite=F_D]. Assume one may define a nonnegative function [formula] in such a way that, for a properly chosen bounded positive integer-valued function [formula] and for any initial value X0 = x with [formula] for some fixed [formula] the Markov chain has a positive drift

[formula]

where [formula] given X0 = x, and the sequence

[formula]

is uniformly integrable in all x such that [formula] Here [formula] and M are fixed positive constants. By Theorem 2.1 from [\cite=F_D], under conditions ()-() imply that, for any [formula],

[formula]

We will apply this Theorem for the following choice of functions [formula] and [formula]: for x = (q,v), we let [formula], and [formula] if [formula] and [formula] if [formula]. We choose [formula] and [formula] below. Before that, we like to mention that our choice of functions leads to redundancy of condition [\eqref=c3] since qi - 1  ≥  qi - 1 a.s.. Also, since [formula] is finite, the increments [formula] are uniformly integrable in x and, therefore, condition [\eqref=c1] is equivalent to

[formula]

for some positive [formula].

Let [formula] be any positive integer such that

[formula]

Since [formula] as n  →    ∞  , one can always find such [formula]. Then, indeed, for [formula]

[formula]

Assume now that [formula] and consider the case where q0 is large and [formula]. On the essence, we repeat the scheme of the last part of the proof of stability, but with considering the opposite inequalities.

First, we choose [formula] and find then [formula] such that, for all [formula],

[formula]

Then we choose [formula] such that

[formula]

Then we choose [formula] so large that, for the sequence {Wn} defined in [\eqref=ZYW] and with initial value [formula], the probability of event

[formula]

is not smaller than [formula]. Finally we choose [formula] such that the total probability distance between the distribution of B1(q - v + ξ1,c / q) and Poisson distribution with parameter c does not exceed [formula], for all q  ≥   and [formula].

Then, putting altogether, we obtain that if [formula], then

[formula]

if [formula]. This completes the proof of the second part of the theorem.

Conclusion

We studied stability of the random access system under stochastic energy harvesting for a model with infinite number of transmitting nodes. We assumed that the harvesting intensity of individual power batteries depends on the number of active users. General stability and instability conditions have been obtained.

The model introduced in this paper assumes an individual energy supply mechanism for each users. One may comment that, in existing wireless systems, the energy harvesting mechanism is such that each user has an individual storage element (battery or capacitor) which is charged by the common energy mechanism (see, for instance, [\cite=XRC]). If the number of users is relatively low, then the amount of energy arriving at a single user does not depend on the total number of users that are storing the energy. However, if the number of users becomes sufficiently large, the energy arriving at an individual user starts to decrease. This effect was discussed in [\cite=Can], [\cite=Tong]. Thus, the models introduced in this paper reflects the features of wireless systems with an energy harvesting mechanism that has a single base station and a large number of user devices.
