Gravitational waves from a SMBH binary in M87

Introduction

A giant elliptical galaxy M87 (NGC 4486), located at 18.4 Mpc, hosts one of the nearest and best-studied AGN. A relativistic one-sided jet is ejected from the galactic center, where a supermassive black hole (SMBH) with a mass of [formula] [\citep=Gebhardt] resides, and extends to hundreds of kilo parsecs.

It was reported in [\citet=Batcheldor] that the luminous center of M87 and the AGN are displaced significantly. The displacement was confirmed in [\citet=Lena2014] and this fact suggests that the SMBH is not located at the center of mass of the galaxy, although there is a large uncertainty in the projected distance (~  1  -  7 ~ pc). Several scenarios have been suggested to interpret this displacement: (1) accelaration by an asymmetric jet, (2) recoil due to gravitational-wave emission caused by a merger of two SMBHs, (3) binary motion with respect to another SMBH and (4) gravitational perturbations from multiple massive objects at the galactic center. As a possible method to distinguish between these scenarios, observation of the proper motion of the SMBH (AGN) was suggested.

Here we focus on the latter two scenarios. Binary formation of two SMBHs through galaxy mergers is a basic process of SMBH evolution. The observed displacement can be explained if the center of mass of a SMBH binary is located at the galactic center and only one of the SMBHs has enough gas accretion to make it an AGN. On the other hand, there is a possibility that multiple intermediate mass BHs (IMBHs) or relatively small SMBHs reside at the galactic center through hierarchical galaxy merging [\citep=Islam2004] [\citep=Rashkov2014]. The displacement can also be explained by gravitational perturbation of the main SMBH from these multiple BHs. In this latter scenario, the main SMBH can form a binary with one of the IMBHs or SMBHs, and the center of mass will not be necessarily located at the galactic center.

If the observed displacement is caused by these mechanisms, a substantial amount of gravitational waves (GWs) is emitted by the SMBH binary. Thus, observation of GWs from M87 can probe the black hole population at the galactic center. In this paper, following these scenarios, we estimate the GWs under the constraints on the binary orbital elements from observations and discuss the detectability of GWs of pulsar timing arrays.

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we summarize the basic formulae of Keplerian motion. In section 3, we describe the formalism to calculate the amplitude of GWs from a binary and its time derivative. In section 4, we present our main results. In section 5, we give a summary and discussion on the detectability of GWs calculated here. For the rest of this paper we set c  =  G  =  1, unless otherwise specified.

Orbital elements of a SMBH binary

The distance between the main SMBH and the barycenter of its host galaxy, r1, is related to the projected displacement, r0, as,

[formula]

where θ is the angle between the line of sight and the direction from the SMBH to the barycenter.

In the following, we discuss the orbital elements of the SMBH binary. The orbital motion is approximated to the Newtonian two-body problem since the binary has a typical separation of [formula] so that gravity is sufficiently weak and the energy loss due to gravitational waves is negligible. The equation of motion for the relative motion of the SMBHs is given by

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], μ  =  m1m2 / (m1  +  m2) is the reduced mass, and [formula] and m2 are the mass of the main and second SMBH, respectively. The orbital elements are described by

[formula]

where p  =  a(1  -  e2), e is the eccentricity (0  ≤  e < 1), a is the semi-major axis, φ is the orbital phase and M  =  m1  +  m2. Fixing the eccentricity, the semi-major axis is maximum (minimum) when the SMBH is located at the pericenter (apocenter) of the orbit. Therefore, the semi-major axis is constrained as

[formula]

On the other hand, the orbital period is written by

[formula]

In the current case, the typical orbital period is 2  ×  103 yrs for a1  =  1 ~ pc and [formula].

Gravitational waves from a binary

Gravitational waves are emitted from a binary and the waveforms of the plus and cross polarizations are given by,

[formula]

Here, p  =  (0,1,0) and q  =  ( -  cos ι,0, sin ι) are the unit vectors of the gravitational wave principal axes where ι is the inclination and hTTij(i,j  =  1,2,3) is the transverse-traceless part of the amplitude given by [\citep=Gopakumar]

[formula]

where n  =  (φ, sin φ,0) and [formula]. Eqs. ([\ref=eq:hplus]) and ([\ref=eq:hcross]) can be rewritten as,

[formula]

where R  =  18.4 ~ Mpc is the distance to M87.

Assuming the photo-center of the galaxy is on the orbital plane, the inclination is constrained as

[formula]

in the case where the main SMBH is located in front of ([formula]) and behind ([formula]) the photo-center, respectively.

In the current situation, the period of gravitational waves is much longer than the observation time span of pulsar timing arrays (O(10) ~ years) so that the amplitude varies linearly with time on this time-scale. Thus, we consider the change in the amplitude in the observational time span, rather than the amplitude itself. To do this, we need the time derivative of the waveforms:

[formula]

These time derivatives can be expressed in terms of r1, e, a1 and m2 by substituting Eqs. ([\ref=eq:r]) and ([\ref=eq:dphidt]) to Eqs. ([\ref=eq:dhdt_plus]) and ([\ref=eq:dhdt_cross]).

Results

First, we show the results for the case where the center of mass of two SMBHs is located at the photo-center of M87. Fig. [\ref=fig:contour] represents the absolute value of the time derivatives of the plus-mode and cross-mode amplitudes in a1 - e plane for r1  =  3 ~ pc and m2  =  m1. Hereafter, the inclination is set to [formula] except for Fig. [\ref=fig:inclination]. The time derivative is of order 10- 25  ~   sec- 1 irrespective of the values of a1 and e, although the ratio of the two polarization modes depends significantly on the phase of the orbital motion φ, which is uniquely determined by a1 and e.

Fig. [\ref=fig:mass] shows the dependence of the time derivatives on the mass of the second SMBH for r1  =  3 ~ pc, e  =  0.8 and a1  =  10.0 ~ pc. The change in the GW amplitude in 10 years, [formula], is also shown and this quantity will be used to discuss the detectability of the GWs later. The dependence is strong ([formula]) for m2  <  m1 and becomes relatively weak ([formula]) for m2  >  m1.

Next, considering that the observed displacement has a large uncertainty, we show the dependence of the same quantity as Fig. [\ref=fig:mass] on the displacement in Fig. [\ref=fig:displacement]. The mass of the second SMBH is set to 3m1,m1 and 0.3m1. From the figure, we see that the change of GW amplitude increases drastically as the displacement decreases. The current uncertainty in the displacement leads to the uncertainty in the change of about 4 orders of magnitude. Here it should be noted that the correspondence between the displacement and the semi-major axis of the main SMBH, which is shown in the upper axis, depends on the eccentricity, which is set to 0.8 in this figure.

Fig. [\ref=fig:inclination] shows the inclination dependence fixing all the other parameters. The inclination does not affect the overall amplitude so much, although the derivative of the cross-mode amplitude becomes zero at [formula].

Finally, we consider another scenario where multiple BHs reside in the central region of M87 and the main SMBH is forming a binary with a smaller BH. As remarked before, the center of mass of the binary need not be located at the galactic center and the binary can have a much smaller semi-major axis compared with the previous cases. Because there is no constraint on the orbital elements, we compute the time derivative of GW amplitude for a number of random sets of orbital elements (semi-major axis, eccentricity, phase and inclination), fixing the mass of the smaller BH. The results are shown as a function of the semi-major axis in Fig. [\ref=fig:random] for m2  =  0.1m1,0.01m1 and 0.001m1. Aside from m2 and semi-major axis, the time derivative of GW amplitude has a strong dependence on the eccentricity and increases significantly for [formula].

Summary and Discussion

In this paper, we estimated gravitational waves from a hypothetical SMBH binary at the center of M87. This follows the scenario that the observed displacement between the AGN and the galactic center can be explained by the existence of another SMBH, or multiple IMBHs or small SMBHs. Because the period of the binary and the resulting GWs is much longer than observational time span, the amplitude changes linearly with time and we calculated the variation of the GW amplitude, rather than the amplitude itself. We investigated the dependence on the orbital elements and the second BH mass taking the observational constraints into account.

Let us discuss the detectability of GWs from M87. Nano-hertz GWs from SMBH binaries are targets of so-called pulsar timing arrays [\citep=Hobbs2010] [\citep=Sesana2013] [\citep=Burke2015]. Because the arrival times of pulses are modulated by GWs, the time variation of timing residuals, the difference between the actual arrival time and the expectation in the absence of GWs, follows the wave form of the GWs crossing the earth. Thus, precise measurements of timing residuals can detect GWs with a long period comparable to the time span of observation. However, timing residuals are also contributed from various noise sources other than GWs. In particular, so called red noise which has a long-term variation is known to exist and its origin has not been identified [\citep=Shannon2013] [\citep=Yi2015]. This red noise makes it very difficult to identify GW signal with a long period. In the current case, the GW period is much longer than the observation span so that the GW amplitude varies linearly. Therefore, in the presence of red noise, it is impossible to identify the GWs solely from the time dependence of timing residuals.

However, while red noise appears to each pulsar independently, the effect of GWs is coherent to all pulsars and thus it will be possible to extract GW signal by taking cross-correlations among timing residuals of multiple pulsars. In fact, in the context of the detection strategy of the gravitational-wave background, [\citet=Hellings1983] proposed this idea and showed the angular correlation function (see also [\cite=Mingarelli2013] [\cite=Taylor2013]). In the current case, since we know the location of the GW source, we can predict the effect on timing residuals for each pulsar with any position in the sky. It is beyond the scope of the current paper to estimate the expected sensitivity of a pulsar timing array with ongoing (such as EPTA, PPTA and NANOGrav) and future (such as the Square Kilometre Array, see [\cite=Kramer2015] [\cite=Janssen2015]) facilities for linearly-changing GWs. However, considering that the pulsar timing array with the Square Kilometre Array will have a sensitivity of ~  10- 16 for nano-Hertz GWs [\citep=Sesana2008] [\citep=Lee2011], we can expect a similar sensitivity for linearly-changing GWs. Taking this sensitivity as a reference value, we will be able to detect GWs from the SMBH binary if the second BH mass is 3 times larger than that of the main SMBH considering the uncertainty in the projected distance. If the projected distance is close to 1 ~ pc, GWs from an equal-mass binary (m2  =  m1) will be detectable. On the other hand, a binary with a smaller SMBH (~  0.1m1) will also lead to detectable GWs if the semi-major axis is small ([formula]), while the eccentricity must be relatively large ([formula]) for an even smaller BH (~  0.01m1).
