The 2-adic valuation of plane partitions and totally symmetric plane partitions

Introduction

In [\cite=AmMoll], Tewodros Amdeberhan and Victor H. Moll discussed the 2-adic valuation of the number of alternating sign matrices, plane partitions, and many of the distinguished symmetric subsets of plane partitions, such as totally symmetric self-complementary plane partitions. They conjectured (Conjecture 3.1 in [\cite=AmMoll]) that

[formula]

where PPn is the number of plane partitions in the n  ×  n  ×  n cube, TSPPn is the number of totally symmetric plane partitions in the n-cube, i.e. plane partitions symmetric under any permutation of the axes, and v2(n) is the highest power of 2 dividing n. The main theorem of this paper is that the conjecture holds. In fact, considerably more seems to be true, the data for which inspired the proof strategy.

Definitions

A plane partition π of an integer x is an array πi,j of nonnegative integers in i,j  ≥  1 such that [formula], which is nonincreasing in rows and columns, that is, πi,j  ≥  πi + 1,j and πi,j  ≥  πi,j + 1 for all i,j. This condition means that π has finite support. The points {(i,j,k)|0  <  k  ≤  πi,j} constitute the three-dimensional Young diagram of π. We say π is in the n-cube if πi,j  ≤  n for all i,j and [formula]. We denote the number of plane partitions in the n-cube by PPn. It has the formula

[formula]

Plane partitions for which the Young diagram is invariant under various involutions of the cube have similarly compact formulas. The set of plane partitions which are invariant under exchange of the i and j axes are called symmetric plane partitions; their number in the n-cube is denoted SPPn and has formula

[formula]

The plane partitions invariant under any permutations of the three axes are called totally symmetric, and are counted by the formula

[formula]

Plane partitions invariant under permutations of the axes, as well as complementation - the operation of taking all lattice points in the n  ×  n  ×  n cube not in the Young diagram of the partition, and exchanging corners to make this a new diagram - are called totally symmetric self-complementary partitions, and they can only appear in a cube of even size 2n. In such a cube, their counting formula is

[formula]

We denote the highest power of 2 dividing n by v2(n), i.e. v2(n) = k if 2k|n but [formula]. We use s2(n) to denote the number of 1s in the binary expansion of n; this function has the properties that s2(2j + 1)  =  1  +  s2(j), s2(2j)  =  s2(j) and s2(3m + 1)  ≤  2s2(m)  +  1. These two quantities are related by a formula of Legendre, v2(m!)  =  m  -  s2(m), which will repeatedly be useful in the following.

Proof of the Main Result

Two points to notice are that, first, the formula for TSPPn is a subset of the factors in the formula for PPn, and second, a great deal of cancellation occurs in both formulas. Triples (i,j,k) from PPn are rejected for TSPPn if i > j, regardless of the relation of k to i and j, or if i  ≤  j but j  >  k, whether i > k or not.

Thus:

[formula]

where for convenience we have switched the i and j entries in the middle product; the factors are symmetric in i and j, so this introduces no problems.

Many of the factors in the numerator and denominator cancel. In the middle term, [formula], most factors arising from a triple (i,j,k) in the numerator cancel with the factor arising from (i,j,k + 1) in the denominator. The exceptions are triples with k = n in the numerator, and those with k = 1 in the denominator. Thus, this term becomes

[formula]

That is, this term is exactly the formula for SPPn except that it is missing the boundary where i = j.

Notice that v2(2i - 1) = 0. If n is even, 2i + n - 1 is odd, and so v2(2i + n - 1) = 0. If n is odd, v2(2i + n - 1) > 0. Over the whole product, we can add in intervening odd factors to create a factorial without changing the 2-adic valuation of the product, to get

[formula]

In the third factor, [formula], a triple (i,j,k) in the numerator cancels with (i + 1,j,k) in the denominator unless i = j in the numerator (if i = n, i = j automatically), or i = 1 in the denominator. We are left with

[formula]

The 2-adic valuation of this product is

[formula]

The last analysis we can perform before we must split the proof into the cases of n even and odd is to determine v2(SPPn):

[formula]

Putting the pieces together so far, we have: if n is even,

[formula]

and if n is odd,

[formula]

We now examine the two cases separately.

Case 1: Even. When n is even, the claim is equivalent to showing that for even n,

[formula]

Begin by noticing that the factors for TSSCPP2n are a subset of the factors counted in this expression. We subtract the 2-adic valuation of TSSCPP2n, which, since this is an integer, is nonnegative; the resulting expression will be simpler.

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Subtracting this from the left-hand side of equation ([\ref=EvenCase]), we get

[formula]

where we have set [formula].

Let [formula]. We wish to show that this expression is strictly positive - that, if the total number of binary digits for all numbers from 0 to k - 1 is compared to that for the interval of the same length moved up 2k, the excess of binary digits in the latter over the former is no more than 2k.

For k > 0, we have [formula].

Proof: Let [formula], [formula]. We will concern ourselves with three contributions: 1s in the binary expansion of the larger values that appear in columns beyond ir, the difference in the number of 1s appearing within the interval in column ir, and the differences in the number of 1s appearing in all columns below ir.

Since the smallest value in the interval

[formula]

, since 2ir + 1  +  2ir + 2  ≥  3k + 3. Hence columns beyond ir contain exactly one 1 for each number in the interval

Relative Sizes

These proof methods are limited in what they can say about the relative sizes of v2(PPn) and v2(TSPPn). The data on the differences calculated, however, suggest two very interesting conjectures.

For even index, the difference v2(PP2n)  -  v2(TSPP2n) appears to be very nearly 5 times the value v2(TSSCPP2n).

Here we have graphed, on the left, the values v2(PP2n)  -  v2(TSPP2n) and v2(TSSCPP2n). On the right, we have the ratio [formula]. The ratio is eccentric near the very low values of v2(TSSCPP2n), but for the most part of the interval is very close to 1. The maximum ratios appear to be exactly 5/3.

For odd index, the difference v2(PP2n - 1)  -  v2(TSPP2n - 1) decreases steadily, its minima lying on the line - 3n. In the right-hand graph below we have diplayed [formula]. The maxima of this ratio are not constant, but again for the most part of the interval the ratio appears to be close to exact.

It is certainly conceivable that these conjectures could be made more precise, and it seems likely that the proof will employ the fact that the ordered triples comprising TSPPn are just 1/6 the cube of triples comprising PPn in their respective formula. However, we offer the conjectures to the reader in their present form.
