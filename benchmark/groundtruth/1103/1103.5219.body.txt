Introduction

Taneja [\cite=tan3] [\cite=tan4] considered the following inequality among some well-known means:

[formula]

where

[formula]

for all a,  b∈(0,  ∞  )

The means, H(a,b), G(a,b), A(a,b) and S(a,b) are known in the literature as harmonic, geometric, arithmetic and root-square means respectively. For simplicity, we can call the mean, N1 as square-root mean. The N2(a,b) can be seen in Taneja [\cite=tan2] and the mean N3(a,b) can be seen in Zhang and Wu [\cite=zhw]. Schur-geometric convexity of the means appearing in ([\ref=eq1]) can be seen in [\cite=szd] [\cite=sjz]

The above measures can be written in terms of arithmetic and geometric means. See below

The convexity of the means ([\ref=eq2])-([\ref=eq12]) can be seen in Taneja [\cite=tan2] [\cite=tan3] [\cite=tan4]. The Schur-geometric convexity is given in [\cite=szd]. The mean difference MN2N3(a,b) is not considered here, since it is not convex.

Taneja [\cite=tan3] proved the following inequalities among the difference of means:

and

The aim of this paper is to obtain bounds on the probability of error in terms of the means given in ([\ref=eq2])-([\ref=eq12]).

f - Divergence and Probability of Error

Csiszár [\cite=csi] have given a measure for the divergence between two probability density functions, say p(x) and q(x). This so called f  -  divergence given by

[formula]

The function f(x), with x∈(0,  ∞  ) is a convex function which has to satisfy the conditions

[formula]

It can be easily checked that Cf(p,q)  ≥  f(1) and that Cf(p,q)  =  f(1) only when p(x)  =  q(x) a.e. Thus, Cf(p,q)  -  f(1) is a distance or divergence measure in the sense that Cf(p,q)  -  f(1)  ≥  0. However, it is not symmetric in p and q and in general does not satisfy triangle inequality.

Boekee and Van der Lubbe [\cite=bov] have introduced the average f  -  divergence between two hypothesis C1 and C2 in terms of their "a posteriori" probabilities. This average f  -  divergence is defined as

[formula]

If we introduce the function

[formula]

and set u  =  u(x)  =  P(C2|x), it is easy to see from P(C1|x)  =  1  -  P(C2|x) that

[formula]

From Vajda [\cite=vaj] it follows that f*(u) is convex on

[formula]

A Class of Upper Bounds

In [\cite=bov] it has been shown that the Bayesian probability of error can be upper bounds in terms of the average f  -  divergence [formula]. This upper bound is given by

[formula]

where f2 should be finite with

[formula]

The above bound is valid only for every convex function f(u) which satisfies the conditions given in ([\ref=eq19]). However, if [formula] is symmetric with respect to [formula] i.e., f*(u)  =  f*(1  -  u), this bound can be written in a simpler form given in the following theorem.

The probability of error is upper bounds by [formula], where f*(u)  =  f*(1  -  u) is symmetric with respect to [formula], as follows:

[formula]

provided f∞ is finite.

If f1  =  f(1)  =  0 and f∞ is finite, then the above bound can be written as

[formula]

In this paper we shall apply the upper bound ([\ref=eq25]) for different divergences based on difference of means given by ([\ref=eq2])-([\ref=eq12]) .
