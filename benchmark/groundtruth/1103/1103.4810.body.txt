The CHSH inequality and the Tsirelson bound

In order to define the amount of correlations made available by some resource, assume that Alice and Bob share a box that takes binary inputs x,y∈{0,1} and produces binary outputs a,b∈{0,1}. The workings of the box are fully described by a set of joint probabilities P(ab|xy). The correlators Exy  =  P(a = b|xy) - P(a  ≠  b|xy) appear in the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality for classical, i.e. local, resources [\cite=CHHS]:

[formula]

Mathematics suggests that the CHSH value can be as high as 4, therefore realizing full non-locality as described by Popescu and Rorlich [\cite=popescu]. However, quantum mechanical resources only provide a maximum value [formula], called the Tsirelson bound [\cite=Tsirel]. One is tempted to find a compelling reason for this value among various physical or information-theoretic principles [\cite=InfCausality] [\cite=vanDam2] [\cite=Brassard] [\cite=Allcock] [\cite=Navascues].

We assume that available resources can be mixed in some sense (Section [\ref=ConnesSection]), so that if Alice and Bob can reach a given CHSH value X∈(2,4], they can combine these non-local resources with local ones and obtain any CHSH value between 2 and X. Such resources can then be used simultaneously. No explicit model or expression is given of the physical resources that would lead to an arbitrary CHSH limit in the interval (2,4]. We conjecture that a low-level description of the physics of such resources is irrelevant for the analysis of correlations that Alice and Bob can build by using them. The combination rule alone is sufficient in order to obtain the Tsirelson bound (Section [\ref=MainSection]).

Combining non-local resources

If available resources permit [formula], then any combination of these or less non-local resources must at most permit the same CHSH value. Let us write RX for a model possessing such resources and use '+  ' notation to denote a combination of models, i.e., RX  +  RY = RZ is a new model whose physical content may be quite different from that of RX and RY. The assumption that non-locality does not increase when we add resources more local than a given threshold means that the two-element set R  =  {R2,RX} can be supplied with idempotent addition:

[formula]

We identify this set with a [formula]-module, i.e., a commutative monoid with an external multiplication by the elements of a finite semi-field [formula] [\cite=Lescot]. This produces a map (λ,x)  →  λx, where [formula] and x∈R, with the following properties:

[formula]

A few surprises can be expected from this notation in the case [formula]. Our goal is to 'lift' this trivial structure on R to a new structure that would allow to consider simultaneously the combinations of models with different CHSH limits or, in other words, that would extend the notion of sum to all λ∈[0,1]. This extension relies on the interpretation of R as a semi-ring of characteristic 1 [\cite=ConnesChar1]. We then build a required extension through another extension known in the literature:

[formula]

of [formula] by the semi-field [formula], which plays a central role in idempotent analysis [\cite=Maslov2] and tropical geometry [\cite=Litvinov] [\cite=Viro].

If R is a semi-ring, then we must explain the meaning of multiplication RX  ·  RY. We identify RX  ·  RY with a box shared between Alice and Bob that is a sequential wiring of two boxes corresponding to RX and RY. Only resources of RX are available in the first part, which receives the initial input (x,y). Only the output of the first part then serves as input of the second part, and the only available resources are from RY. Final output (a,b) is the output of the second stage only. The resulting correlations arise from this 'chain' of boxes, which is different from the wirings with a memory of the initial input that can distill entanglement and raise the CHSH value [\cite=Forster] [\cite=Brunner] [\cite=Allcock]. The multiplicative structure on R is a monoid and distributivity law holds. One can see that

[formula]

because inserting a local stage into any chain of wired boxes reduces final correlations to purely local. This semi-ring is multiplicatively cancellative:

[formula]

Further assumptions are needed in order to apply to R Connes's result [\cite=ConnesConsani]. We formally assume that the semi-ring is perfect, i.e., the map RX  →  RnX is a bijection for any [formula], and the multiplicative group is uniquely divisible, so that expressions θα(RX) = RαX make sense for all rational α. In this case we obtain a partially ordered vector space over [formula] and, following Connes [\cite=ConnesChar1], we assume that it is a partially ordered space over [formula]. Then there exists a deformation of R into a semi-ring of characteristic zero that allows us to express the sum of multiplicative 'lifts' of RX and RY as:

[formula]

where [formula], T > 0 and the coefficients

[formula]

where S(α) is the entropy of a simple binary mixing:

[formula]

Formula ([\ref=TheSum]) resembles the extension of [formula] to the tropical field [formula] and it helps in our case to study models RY,2  ≤  Y  ≤  X, whose maximum CHSH values lie between two given extremes. Most importantly, although we may know the physical content of R2 and RX, nothing can be said about the physical content of RY: these mixed models are studied purely formally and only with respect to their CHSH limit.

Main conjecture

We have conjectured in ([\ref=TheSum]) how to build models whose resources reach intermediate CHSH limit values. This construction depends on the choice of parameter T, for which the value T  ~   was suggested [\cite=Maslov2] providing an analogy with the generating functional in quantum field theory [\cite=ConnesChar1]. This makes sense if we study the field of real numbers but is misleading in the case of semi-field R composed of models. Another analogy might be developed with free energy in thermodynamics, suggesting that T should be linked with the Boltzmann constant. However, we focus here on a simple case described qualitatively in ([\ref=TheEnt]). If only binary mixings of RX and RY with different 'weights' are taken into account, it is reasonable to see an analogy between the exponent in ([\ref=TheOmega]) and the partition function of a binary distribution, therefore taking T = 1. As a result, the model combining R2 and RX is written as:

[formula]

where we have formally replaced the sum by the idempotent integral over

[formula]

Conclusion

Many highly speculative, conjectural steps were involved in getting to ([\ref=TheConj]). However, a few meaningful assumptions may merit special attention:

Models with different CHSH limit values form a [formula]-module with idempotent addition and therefore possess a partial order, which is somewhat analogous to Birkhoff's results in lattice theory [\cite=Lescot]. However, it is not clear whether there exists a further analogy between quantum logic and the category of [formula]-modules.

In order to define a combination of models with different CHSH limit values, it is not mandatory to give their low-level physical description. Global properties of such models, e.g., the amount of correlations that one can obtain by using them, can be studied independently.

The multiplicative structure of models, i.e., their wirings in chains of boxes, is a powerful tool for approaching the problem of model combination. These chains alone suffice in order to give an extension of the original finite semi-ring into a rich structure of models, whose physical meaning remains unknown in spite of the possibility to study the amount of correlations that they provide.

Finally, our conjecture suggests a small but finite difference between the maximum CHSH value in the physical world and the theoretical Tsirelson bound. Although it is beyond reach of today's technology, this difference may eventually become observable. This will either disprove or confirm our conjecture.
