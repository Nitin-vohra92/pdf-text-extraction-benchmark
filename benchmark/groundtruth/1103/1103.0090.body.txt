Wavelet packets and wavelet frame packets on local fields

Introduction

The concepts of wavelet and multiresolution analysis of [formula] has been extended to many different setups. Dahlke [\cite=Dah] introduced it in locally compact groups (see also [\cite=Far] [\cite=La1] [\cite=La2] [\cite=La3]). It was generalized to abstract Hilbert spaces by Han, Larson, Papadakis, Stavropoulos [\cite=HLPS] [\cite=SP]. Lemarie [\cite=Le] extended this concept to stratified Lie groups.

Recently, R. L. Benedetto and J. J. Benedetto ([\cite=BB] [\cite=Ben]) developed a wavelet theory for local fields and related groups. Albeverio, Kozyrev, Khrennikov, Shelkovich, Skopina and their collaborators also discuss about MRA and wavelets on the p-adic field [formula] in a series of papers [\cite=AK] [\cite=KS] [\cite=KSS] [\cite=Koz]. Note that [formula] is a local field of characteristic 0.

Jiang, Li and Jin [\cite=JLJ] gave a definition of MRA on a local field of positive characteristic p and, similar to [formula], have constructed the wavelets from an MRA.

In this article we construct the wavelet packets associated with such an MRA. We also generalize the wavelet frame packets to this setup. First of all, we will discuss about wavelet packets very briefly.

Let [formula] be an MRA of [formula] with scaling function φ and wavelet ψ. Let Wj be the corresponding wavelet subspaces: [formula]. In the construction of a wavelet from an MRA, essentially the space V1 is split into two orthogonal components V0 and W0. Note that V1 is the closure of the linear span of the functions [formula], whereas V0 and W0 are respectively the closure of the span of [formula] and [formula]. Since [formula], we see that the above procedure splits the half integer translates of a function into integer translates of two functions.

In a similar way, we can split Wj, which is the span of [formula], to get two functions whose 2- (j - 1)k translates will span the same space Wj. Repeating the splitting procedure j times, we get 2j functions whose integer translates alone span the space Wj. If we apply this to each Wj, then the resulting basis of [formula] will consist of integer translates of a countable number of functions (instead of all dilations and translations of the wavelet ψ). This basis is called the "wavelet packet basis". The concept of wavelet packets was introduced by Coifman, Meyer and Wickerhauser [\cite=cmw1] [\cite=cmw2]. For a nice exposition of wavelet packets of [formula] with dilation 2, we refer to [\cite=hw].

The concept of wavelet packet was subsequently generalized to [formula] by taking tensor products [\cite=cm]. The non-tensor product versions are due to Shen [\cite=she] for dyadic dilation, and Behera [\cite=Beh] for MRAs with a general dilation matrix and several scaling functions. Other notable generalizations are the biorthogonal wavelet packets [\cite=cd], non-orthogonal version of wavelet packets [\cite=cl], the wavelet frame packets [\cite=che] on [formula] for dilation 2, and the orthogonal, biorthogonal and frame wavelet packets on [formula] by Long and Chen [\cite=lc] for the dyadic dilation.

We have organized the article as follows. In section 2, we discuss some preliminary facts about local fields. In section 3, we introduce the concept of MRA on a local field K of positive characteristic and prove a crucial lemma called the splitting lemma. We construct the wavelet packets in section 4 and prove that they generate an orthonormal basis for L2(K). In section 5, we prove some basic results needed to prove an analogue of splitting lemma for wavelet frames on K and finally in section 6 the wavelet frame packets are constucted.

Preliminaries on local fields

Let K be a field and a topological space. Then K is called a locally compact field or a local field if both K+ and K* are locally compact abelian groups, where K+ and K* denote the additive and multiplicative groups of K respectively.

If K is any field and is endowed with the discrete topology, then K is a local field. Further, if K is connected, then K is either [formula] or [formula]. If K is not connected, then it is totally disconnected. So by a local field, we mean a field K which is locally compact, nondiscrete and totally disconnected.

We use the notation of the book by Taibleson [\cite=Taib]. Proofs of all the results stated in this section can be found in the books [\cite=Taib] or [\cite=RV].

Let K be a local field. Since K+ is a locally compact abelian group, we choose a Haar measure dx for K+. If α  ≠  0,α∈K, then d(αx) is also a Haar measure. Let d(αx)  =  |α|dx. We call |α| the absolute value or valuation of α. We also let |0|  =  0.

The map x  →  |x| has the following properties:

|x|  =  0 if and only if x = 0;

|xy| = |x||y| for all x,y∈K;

|x + y|  ≤   max {|x|,|y|} for all x,y∈K.

Property (c) is called the ultrametric inequality.

The set [formula] is called the ring of integers in K. It is the unique maximal compact subring of K. Define [formula]. The set [formula] is called the prime ideal in K. The prime ideal in K is the unique maximal ideal in [formula]. It is principal and prime.

Since K is totally disconnected, the set of values |x| as x varies over K is a discrete set of the form [formula] for some s > 0. Hence, there is an element of [formula] of maximal absolute value. Let [formula] be a fixed element of maximum absolute value in [formula]. Such an element is called a prime element of K. Note that as an ideal in [formula].

It can be proved that [formula] is compact and open. Hence, [formula] is compact and open. Therefore, the residue space [formula] is isomorphic to a finite field GF(q), where q = pc for some prime p and [formula]. For a proof of this fact we refer to  [\cite=Taib].

For a measurable subset E of K, let [formula], where χE is the characteristic function of E and dx is the Haar measure of K normalized so that [formula]. Then, it is easy to see that [formula] and [formula] (see [\cite=Taib]). It follows that if x  ≠  0, and x∈K, then |x| = qk for some [formula].

Let [formula]. [formula] is the group of units in K*. If x  ≠  0, we can write [formula], with [formula].

Recall that [formula]. Let U  =  {ai}q - 1i = 0 be any fixed full set of coset representatives of [formula] in [formula]. Let [formula]. These are called fractional ideals. Each [formula] is compact and open and is a subgroup of K+ (see [\cite=RV]). Then, if [formula], x can be expressed uniquely as [formula].

If K is a local field, then there is a nontrivial, unitary, continuous character χ on K+. It can be proved that K+ is self dual (see [\cite=Taib]).

Let χ be a fixed character on K+ that is trivial on [formula] but is nontrivial on [formula]. We can find such a character by starting with any nontrivial character and rescaling. We will define such a character for a local field of positive characteristic. For y∈K, we define χy(x) = χ(yx), x∈K.

If f∈L1(K), then the Fourier transform of f is the function [formula] defined by

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

Similar to the standard Fourier analysis on the real line, one can prove the following results.

The map f  →   is a bounded linear transformation of L1(K) into L∞(K), and [formula].

If f∈L1(K), then [formula] is uniformly continuous.

[formula], then [formula].

To define the Fourier transform of function in L2(K), we introduce the functions Φk. For [formula], let Φk be the characteristic function of [formula].

For f∈L2(K), let fk = fΦ- k and

[formula]

where the limit is taken in L2(K).

We have the following theorem (see Theorem 2.3 in [\cite=Taib]).

The fourier transform is unitary on L2(K).

Let χu be any character on K+. Since [formula] is a subgroup of K+, the restriction [formula] is a character on [formula]. Also, as character on [formula] if and only if [formula]. That is, χu  =  χv if [formula] and χu  ≠  χv if [formula]. Hence, if {u(n)}∞n = 0 is a complete list of distinct coset representative of [formula] in K+, then {χu(n)}∞n = 0 is a list of distinct characters on [formula]. It is proved in [\cite=Taib] that this list is complete. That is, we have the following proposition.

Let {u(n)}∞n = 0 be a complete list of (distinct) coset representatives of [formula] in K+. Then {χu(n)}∞n = 0 is a complete list of (distinct) characters on [formula]. Moreover, it is a complete orthonormal system on [formula].

Given such a list of characters {χu(n)}∞n = 0, we define the Fourier coefficients of [formula] as

[formula]

The series [formula] is called the Fourier series of f. From the standard L2 theory for compact abelian groups we conclude that the Fourier series of f converges to f in [formula] and

[formula]

Also, if [formula] and (u(n)) = 0 for all [formula], then f = 0 a. e.

These results hold irrespective of the ordering of the characters. We now proceed to impose a natural order on the sequence {u(n)}∞n = 0. Note that [formula] is isomorphic to the finite field GF(q) and GF(q) is a c-dimensional vector space over the field GF(p). We choose a set [formula] such that span[formula]. Let [formula]. For [formula] such that 0  ≤  n < q, we have

[formula]

Define

[formula]

Now, write

[formula]

and define

[formula]

Note that u(0) = 0 and {u(n)}q - 1n = 0 is a complete set of coset representatives of [formula] in [formula] (see [\cite=Taib]). Hence, [formula] is a complete set of coset representatives of [formula] in [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

In general, it is not true that u(m + n) = u(m) + u(n). But

[formula]

For brevity, we will write χn  =  χu(n),n  ≥  0. As mentioned before, {χn}∞n = 0 is a complete set of characters on [formula].

Let U  =  {ai}q - 1i = 0 be a fixed set of coset representatives of [formula] in [formula]. Then every x∈K can be expressed uniquely as

[formula]

Let K be a local field characteristic p > 0 and [formula] be as above. We define a character χ on K as follows:

[formula]

Note that χ is trivial on [formula] but nontrivial on [formula].

In order to be able to define the concepts of multiresolution analysis and wavelets on local fields, we need analogous notions of translation and dilation. Since [formula] we can regard [formula] as the dilation (note that [formula]) and since [formula] is a complete list of distinct coset representatives of [formula] in K, the set [formula] can be treated as the translation set. So we make the following definition.

A finite set [formula] is called a set of basic wavelets of L2(K) if the system [formula] forms an orthonormal basis for L2(K).

Multiresolution analysis on local fields and the splitting lemma

Similar to [formula], wavelets can be constructed from a multiresolution analysis which we define below (see [\cite=JLJ]).

Let K be a local field of characteristic p > 0, [formula] be a prime element of K and u(n)∈K for [formula] be as defined above. A multiresolution analysis (MRA) of L2(K) is a sequence [formula] of closed subspaces of L2(K) satisfying the following properties:

Vj  ⊂  Vj + 1 for all [formula];

[formula] is dense in L2(K) and [formula];

f∈Vj if and only if [formula] for all [formula];

there is a function φ∈V0, called the scaling function, such that [formula] forms an orthonormal basis for V0.

Given an MRA [formula], we define another sequence [formula] of closed subspaces of L2(K) by

[formula]

These subspaces also satisfy

[formula]

Moreover, they are mutually orthogonal, and we have the following orthogonal decompositions:

[formula]

Observe that the dilation is induced by [formula] and [formula]. As in the case of [formula], we expect the existence of q - 1 number of functions [formula] to form a set of basic wavelets. In view of  ([\ref=e.wj]) and ([\ref=e.L2decomp1]), it is clear that if [formula] is a set of function such that [formula] forms an orthonormal basis for W0, then [formula] forms an orthonormal basis for L2(K).

For f∈L2(K), we define

[formula]

Then it is easy to see that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since φ∈V0  ⊂  V1, and [formula] is an orthonormal basis in V1, we have

[formula]

where hk  =  〈φ,φ1,k〉 and [formula]. Taking Fourier transform, we get

[formula]

where [formula].

Let us call a function f on K integral-periodic if

[formula]

The following facts were proved in [\cite=JLJ].

χk(u(l)) = χ(u(k)u(l)) = 1 for all [formula].

The function m0 is integral-periodic.

The system [formula] is orthonormal if and only if [formula] a.e.

Given an MRA of L2(K), suppose that there exist q - 1 integral-periodic functions ml, 1  ≤  l  ≤  q - 1, such that the matrix

[formula]

is unitary. It was also proved in [\cite=JLJ] that [formula] is a set of basic wavelets of L2(K) if we define

[formula]

We now prove a lemma, the splitting lemma, which is essential for the construction of wavelet packets. With the help of this lemma, we can decompose a closed subspace of L2(K) into finitely many mutually orthogonal subspaces in a suitable manner.

Let φ∈L2(K) be such that [formula] is an orthonormal system. Let [formula]. Let [formula], 0  ≤  l  ≤  q - 1, where [formula] for 0  ≤  l  ≤  q - 1. Define [formula]. Then [formula] is an orthonormal system in V if and only if the matrix is unitary for a.e [formula].

Moreover, [formula] is an orthonormal basis of V whenever it is orthonormal.

Assume that M(ξ) is unitary for a.e [formula]. Then, for 0  ≤  s,t  ≤  q - 1 and [formula], we have

[formula]

Hence, [formula] is an orthonormal system in V. The converse can be proved by reversing the above steps.

To prove the second part, let f∈V be such that f is orthogonal to ψl(  ·   - u(k)) for all [formula], [formula]. We claim that f = 0 a. e.

Since f∈V, we have

[formula]

for some [formula]. So there exists an integral periodic function mf in [formula] such that

[formula]

Hence, for all [formula], [formula], we have (by a similar calculation)

[formula]

Therefore, for all [formula], we have Now, for a.e. ξ, the vector [formula], being orthogonal to each row vector of the unitary matrix M(ξ), is the zero vector. In particular, [formula] a.e. This means  = 0 a. e. and hence f = 0 a. e.

Construction of wavelet packets

Let [formula] be an MRA of L2(K) and φ be the corresponding scaling function. Then we have (see [\eqref=e.m0]),

[formula]

Applying the splitting lemma to V = V1, we get [formula] is an orthonormal basis for V1. Now we will define a sequence {ωn:n  ≥  0} of functions. Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

where

[formula]

Suppose ωm is defined for m  ≥  0. For 0  ≤  r  ≤  q - 1, define

[formula]

Note that this defines ωn for every integer n  ≥  0. Taking Fourier Transform, we have

[formula]

The functions {ωn:n  ≥  0,} as defined above will be called the wavelet packets corresponding to the MRA [formula] of L2(K).

In the following proposition we find an expression for the Fourier transforms of the wavelet packets in terms of [formula].

For an integer n  ≥  1, consider the unique expansion of n in the base q:

[formula]

where 0  ≤  μi  ≤  q - 1 for all [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

We will prove it by induction. If n has an expansion as in [\eqref=eqn:q.ary], then we say that it has length j. Since ω0  =  φ, and ωn  =  ψn,1  ≤  n  ≤  q - 1, it follows from [\eqref=e.m0] and [\eqref=e.hatpsil] that the claim is true for length 1. Assume that it is true for length j. Let m be an integer with an expansion of length j + 1. Then there exist integers [formula] with [formula] and [formula] such that

[formula]

where [formula]. Note that k has length j. Hence,

[formula]

Hence the induction is complete.

We will prove the following theorem regarding the wavelet packets.

Let {ωn:n  ≥  0} be the basic wavelet packets constructed above. Then

[formula] is an orthonormal basis of Wj, j  ≥  0.

[formula] is an orthonormal basis of Vj, j  ≥  0.

[formula] is an orthonormal basis of L2(K).

Since {ωn:1  ≤  n  ≤  q - 1} are wavelets, the case j = 0 in (i) is trivial. Assume (i) for j. We will prove for j + 1. By our assumption, the set of functions [formula] is an orthonormal basis of Wj. By [\eqref=e.wj], we have

[formula]

is an orthonormal basis for Wj + 1. Let

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

Applying the splitting lemma to En, we get the functions such that [formula] forms an orthonormal basis for En. Hence, [formula] forms an orthonormal basis for Wj + 1. But by ([\ref=wpkt]),

[formula]

This fact, together with ([\ref=eqn:wjp1]), shows that

[formula]

is an orthonormal basis for Wj + 1. So (i) is proved. Item (ii) follows from the observation that [formula] and (iii) follows from the fact that [formula].

Wavelet frame packets

Let H be a separable Hilbert space. A sequence [formula] of H is said to be a frame for H if there exist constants C1 and C2, 0 < C1  ≤  C2  <    ∞   such that for all x∈H

[formula]

The largest C1 and the smallest C2 for which ([\ref=eqn:frame]) holds are called the frame bounds.

Suppose that [formula] be such that the system [formula] is a frame for its closed linear span S(Φ). Let [formula] be elements in S(Φ). A natural question to ask is: When can we say that [formula] is also a frame for S(Φ)?

If ψj∈S(Φ), then there exists [formula] in [formula] such that

[formula]

Taking Fourier transform, we get

[formula]

where [formula]. Let P(ξ) be the N  ×  N matrix:

[formula]

Let S and T be two positive definite matrices of order N. We say S  ≤  T if T - S is positive definite. The following lemma is the generalization of Lemma 3.1 in [\cite=che].

Let φl,ψl for 1  ≤  l  ≤  N, and P(ξ) be as above. Suppose that there exist constants C1 and C2, 0 < C1  ≤  C2  <    ∞   such that

[formula]

Then, for all f∈L2(K), we have

[formula]

For f,g∈L2(K), we define

[formula]

Then, for f∈L2(K), we have

[formula]

since Pjk are integral periodic function. Hence

[formula]

where

[formula]

By Plancherel Theorem,

[formula]

Hence, inequality [\eqref=eqn:phipsi] is equivalent to

[formula]

This follows from [\eqref=eqn:pstar].

We now introduce a matrix E(ξ). For 0  ≤  r,s  ≤  q - 1 and 1  ≤  l,j  ≤  N, define for a.e. ξ Let and

[formula]

So E(ξ) is a block matrix with q blocks in each row and each column, and each block is a square matrix of order N, so that E(ξ) is a square matrix of order qN.

We have the following lemma which will be useful for the splitting trick for frames. In the first part of the lemma we use a technique used by Zheng in [\cite=Z].

For 0  ≤  r,s  ≤  q - 1,

[formula]

The matrix E(ξ), defined in ([\ref=eqn:matE]), is unitary for a.e. [formula].

(i) If r = s then u(r) - u(s) = 0, hence the left hand side equals 1. We assume r  ≠  s. Let

[formula]

where 0  ≤  aj,bj  ≤  p - 1 for [formula]. Then (see [\eqref=e.undef])

[formula]

Now, let

[formula]

Observe that as t varies from 0 to q - 1, the integers [formula] all vary from 0 to p - 1. For each [formula], we write

[formula]

for some unique γjr,l∈GF(p),0  ≤  l  ≤  c - 1. Similarly,

[formula]

for some unique γjs,l∈GF(p),0  ≤  l  ≤  c - 1. By the definition of the character χ (see [\eqref=chi]), we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Since r  ≠  s, we claim that [formula] for some j, 0  ≤  j  ≤  c - 1. If γjr,0  =  γjs,0 for all j, then, since [formula], we have

[formula]

This is a contradiction which proves the claim. Now for any j such that [formula], we have

[formula]

since γjr,0  -  γjs,0 is an integer with |γjr,0  -  γjs,0| < p. This proves (i).

To prove (ii), observe that the (r,s)-th block of the matrix E(ξ)E*(ξ) is

[formula]

The (l,j)-th entry in this block is

[formula]

Hence E(ξ)E*(ξ) = I. Similarly, E(ξ)*E(ξ) = I. Therefore, E(ξ) is a unitary matrix.

Splitting lemma for wavelet frame packets

Let {φj:1  ≤  j  ≤  N} be functions in L2(K) such that [formula] is a frame for its closed linear span V. For 1  ≤  l  ≤  N, 0  ≤  r  ≤  q - 1, suppose that there exist sequences [formula]. Define

[formula]

Taking Fourier transform, we get

[formula]

where,

[formula]

Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

Note that H(ξ) is a square matrix of order qN. We can write ψrl as

[formula]

where

[formula]

Note that [formula] (see eq. [\eqref=eq.un]). Taking Fourier transform, we obtain

[formula]

where [formula]. Define the matrices and

[formula], where E(ξ) is the unitary matrix defined in ([\ref=eqn:matE]).

The (r,s)-th block of the matrix [formula] is the matrix

[formula]

The (l,j)-th entry in this block is equal to

[formula]

Now, the (l,j)-th entry in the (r,s)-th block of H(ξ) is

[formula]

In particular, we have Since E(ξ) is unitary by Lemma [\ref=lem:matrix], H*(ξ)H(ξ) and [formula] are similar matrices.

Let λ(ξ) and Λ(ξ) respectively be the maximal and minimal eigenvalues of the positive definite matrix H*(ξ)H(ξ), and let [formula] and [formula]. Suppose 0 < λ  ≤  Λ  <    ∞  . Then we have

[formula]

This is equivalent to say that

[formula]

Then by Lemma [\ref=lem:frame], for all g∈L2(K), we have

[formula]

where φ(s)l is defined in ([\ref=eqn:phisj]). Since which follows from ([\ref=eqn:phisj]), inequality ([\ref=eqn:lambda1]) can be written as

[formula]

This is the splitting trick for frames.

We now apply the splitting trick to the functions {ψsl:1  ≤  l  ≤  N} for each s, 0  ≤  s  ≤  q - 1. We have

[formula]

where ψs,rl,0  ≤  r  ≤  q - 1 are defined as:

[formula]

Summing ([\ref=eqn:split1]) over 0  ≤  s  ≤  q - 1, we have

[formula]

Using ([\ref=eqn:lambda2]), we obtain

[formula]

We now define the wavelet frame packets similar to the orthonormal case. We start with the functions [formula]. Apply the splitting trick to the space

[formula]

to get the functions {ψsl:1  ≤  l  ≤  N,0  ≤  s  ≤  q - 1} (see ([\ref=eqn:lambda2])). Now for any integer n  ≥  0, we define ψnl, 1  ≤  l  ≤  N, recursively as follows. Suppose that ψrl is already defined for [formula] and 1  ≤  l  ≤  N. Then for 0  ≤  s  ≤  q - 1 and 1  ≤  l  ≤  N, define

[formula]

Comparing this with equation ([\ref=eqn:fsrl.frame]), we see that

[formula]

So ([\ref=eqn:split2]) can be written as

[formula]

By induction, we get for each j  ≥  1

[formula]

We summarize the above discussion in the following theorem.

Let {φl:1  ≤  l  ≤  N}  ⊂  L2(K) be such that [formula] is a frame for its closed linear span V0, with frame bounds C1 and C2 . Let H(ξ),Hr(ξ),λ and Λ be as above. Assume that all entries of H(ξ) are bounded measurable functions such that 0 < λ  ≤  Λ  <    ∞  . Let {ψnl:n  ≥  0,1  ≤  l  ≤  N} be the wavelet frame packets and let [formula]. Then for all j  ≥  0, the system of functions

[formula]

is a frame of Vj with frame bounds λjC1 and ΛjC2.

Since [formula] is a frame of V0 with frame bounds C1 and C2, it is clear that for all j

[formula]

is a frame of Vj with the same bounds. So from ([\ref=eqn:splitj]), we have for all g∈Vj.
