An indispensable classification of monomial curves in [formula]

Introduction

Let [formula] be the polynomial ring in n variables over a field [formula] As usual, we will denote by [formula] the monomial [formula] of [formula] with [formula] where [formula] stands for the set of non-negative integers. Recall that a pure difference binomial ideal is an ideal of [formula] generated by differences of monic monomials. Examples of pure difference binomial ideals are the toric ideals. Indeed, let [formula] and consider the semigroup homomorphism [formula] The kernel of π is denoted by IA and called the toric ideal of A. Notice that the toric ideal IA is generated by all the binomials [formula] such that [formula], see, for example, [\cite=Sturmfels95].

Defining ideals of monomial curves in the affine n-dimensional space [formula] serve as interesting examples of toric ideals. Of particular interest is to compute and describe a minimal generating set for such an ideal. In [\cite=Herzog70] Herzog provides a minimal system of generators for the defining ideal of a monomial space curve. The case n = 4 was treated by Bresisnky in [\cite=Bresinsky88], where Gröbner bases techniques have been used to obtain a a minimal generating set of the ideal.

A recent topic arising in Algebraic Statistics is to study the problem when a toric ideal has a unique minimal system of binomial generators, see [\cite=Charalambous07], [\cite=OjVi2]. To deal with this problem, Ohsugi and Hibi introduced in [\cite=OhHi05] the notion of indispensable binomials, while Aoki, Takemura and Yoshida introduced in [\cite=ATY08] the notion of indispensable monomials. The problem was considered for the case of defining ideals of monomial curves in [\cite=GOj10]. Although this work offers useful information, the classification of the ideals having a unique minimal system of binomial generators remains an unsolved problem for n  ≥  4. For monomial space curves Herzog's result provides an explicit classification of those defining ideals satisfying the above property. The aim of this work is to classify all defining ideals of monomial curves in [formula] having a unique minimal system of generators. Our approach is inspired by the classification made by Pilar Pisón in her unpublished thesis.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 1 we study indispensable monomials and binomials of a pure difference binomial ideal. We provide a criterion for checking whether a monomial is indispensable, see Theorem [\ref=Thm_CombIndMonJ], and also a sufficient condition for a binomial to be indispensable, see Theorem [\ref=Thm_CombIndBinJ]. As an application we prove that the binomial edge ideal of an undirected simple graph has a unique minimal system of binomial generators. Section 2 is devoted to special classes of binomial ideals contained in the defining ideal of a monomial curve. Corollary [\ref=Cor_Critical] underlines the significance of the critical ideal in the investigation of our problem. Theorem [\ref=Indisp_Circuits1] and Proposition [\ref=Indisp_Circuits2] provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a circuit to be indispensable of the toric ideal, while Corollary [\ref=Cor_indispensablebinom3] will be particularly useful in the next section. In section 3 we study defining ideals of monomial curves in [formula]. Theorem [\ref=Thm_Critical2] carries out a thorough analysis of a minimal generating set of the critical ideal. This analysis is used to derive a minimal generating set for the defining ideal of the monomial curve, see Theorem [\ref=Th_Main]. As a consequence we obtain the desired classification, see Theorem [\ref=Thm_Critical1]. Finally we prove that the defining ideal of a Gorenstein monomial curve in [formula] has a unique minimal system of binomial generators, under the hypothesis that the ideal is not a complete intersection.

Generalities on indispensable monomials and binomials

Let [formula] be the polynomial ring over a field [formula] The following result is folklore, but for a lack of reference we sketch a proof.

Let [formula] be a pure difference binomial ideal. There exist a positive integer d and a vector configuration [formula] such that the toric ideal IA is a minimal prime of J.

By [\cite=Eisenbud96], [formula] is a lattice ideal. More precisely, if [formula] then

[formula]

Now, by [\cite=Eisenbud96], the only minimal prime of IL which is a pure difference binomial ideal is [formula] where [formula] Since [formula] for [formula] then [formula] for every [formula] and hence the toric ideal of [formula] is equal to [formula] (see [\cite=Sturmfels95]).

Finally, in order to see that IA is a minimal prime of J, it suffices to note that J  ⊆  P implies [formula] for every prime ideal P of [formula]

Observe that if [formula] then [formula] So, it is easy to see that, in general, J  ≠  IL. For example, if J  =  〈x - y,z - t,y2 - yt〉, then IL  =  〈x - t,y - t,z - t〉.

Given a vector configuration [formula] we grade [formula] by setting [formula] We define the A  -  degree of a monomial [formula] to be

[formula]

A polynomial [formula] is A  -  homogeneous if the A  -  degrees of all the monomials that occur in f are the same. An ideal [formula] is A  -  homogeneous if it is generated by A  -  homogeneous polynomials. Notice that the toric ideal IA is A  -  homogeneous; indeed, by [\cite=Sturmfels95], a binomial [formula] if and only if it is A  -  homogeneous.

The proof of the following result is straightforward.

Let [formula] be a pure difference binomial ideal and let [formula] Then J is A  -  homogeneous if and only if J  ⊆  IA.

Notice that the finest A  -  grading on [formula] such that a pure difference binomial ideal [formula] is A  -  homogeneous occurs when IA is a minimal prime of J. Such an A  -  grading does always exist by Theorem [\ref=Th_AgradJ]. Ideals with finest A  -  grading are studied in much greater generality in [\cite=KaAp10]. An A  -  grading on [formula] such that a pure difference binomial ideal [formula] is A  -  homogeneous is said to be positive if the quotient ring [formula] does not contain invertible elements or, equivalently, if the monoid [formula] is free of units.

The A  -  degrees of the polynomials appearing in any minimal system of A-homogeneous generators of IA do not depend on the system of generators: it is well known that the number of polynomials of A  -  degree [formula] in a minimal system of A-homogeneous generators is [formula] (see, e.g. [\cite=Sturmfels95]). Thus, we say that IA has minimal generators in degree [formula] when [formula] In this case, if f∈IA has degree [formula] we say that f is a minimal generator of IA.

From now on, let [formula] be such that the quotient ring [formula] does not contain invertible elements and let [formula] an A  -  homogeneous pure difference binomial ideal.

A binomial [formula] is called indispensable of J if every system of binomial generators of J contains f or - f, while a monomial [formula] is called indispensable of J if every system of binomial generators of J contains a binomial f such that [formula] is a monomial of f.

In the following we will write MJ for the monomial ideal generated by all [formula] for which there exists a nonzero [formula]

The next proposition is the natural generalization of [\cite=Charalambous07], but for completeness, we give a proof.

The indispensable monomials of J are precisely the minimal generators of MJ.

Let [formula] be a system of binomial generators of J. Clearly, the monomials of the [formula] generate MJ. Let [formula] be a minimal generator of MJ. Then [formula] for some nonzero [formula] Now, the minimality of [formula] assures that [formula] is a monomial of fj for some j. Therefore every minimal generator of MJ is an indispensable monomial of J. Conversely, let [formula] be an indispensable monomial of J. If [formula] is not a minimal generator of MJ, then there is a minimal generator [formula] of MJ such that [formula] with [formula] By the previous argument [formula] is an indispensable monomial of J, hence without loss of generality we may suppose that [formula] for some k. Thus, if [formula] then

[formula]

and therefore we can replace fj by f'j in [formula] By repeating this argument as many times as necessary, we will find a system of binomial generators of J such that no element has [formula] as monomial, a contradiction to the fact that [formula] is indispensable.

If [formula] is an indispensable monomial of IA, then it is also an indispensable monomial of J.

It suffices to note that MJ  ⊆  MIA by Corollary [\ref=Cor_AgradJ].

Now, we will give a combinatorial necessary and sufficient condition for a monomial [formula] to be indispensable of J.

For every [formula] we define the graph [formula] whose vertices are the monomials of MJ of A  -  degree [formula] and two vertices [formula] and [formula] are joined by an edge if

[formula]

There exists a monomial [formula] dividing [formula] such that the binomial [formula] belongs to J.

Notice that [formula] exactly when MJ has no element of A  -  degree [formula] in particular, [formula] if [formula] because [formula] (otherwise, [formula] would contain invertible elements). Moreover, since J  ⊆  IA, we have that [formula] is a subgraph of [formula] for all [formula] Finally, we observe that condition (b) is trivially fulfilled for J  =  IA because [formula] in this case, if [formula] the graph [formula] is nothing but the 1 - skeleton of the simplicial complex [formula] appearing in [\cite=OjVi2]. Thus, we have the following:

Let [formula] be a binomial of A  -  degree [formula] Then, f is a minimal generator of IA if and only if [formula] and [formula] lie in two different connected components of [formula] in particular, the graph is disconnected.

For a proof see, for example, [\cite=OjVi].

The next theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a monomial to be indispensable of J.

A monomial [formula] is indispensable of J if and only if [formula] is connected component of [formula] where [formula]

Suppose that [formula] is an indispensable monomial of J and [formula] is not a connected component of [formula] Then, there exists [formula] with A  -  degree equals [formula] such that [formula] and [formula], where [formula] divides [formula]. So [formula] and properly divides [formula] a contradiction to the fact that [formula] is a minimal generator of MJ (see Proposition [\ref=Prop_IndMonJ]). Conversely, we assume that [formula] is connected component of [formula] with [formula] and that [formula] is not an indispensable monomial of J. Then, by Proposition [\ref=Prop_IndMonJ], there exists a binomial [formula] such that [formula] properly divides [formula] Let [formula] then [formula] divides [formula] and hence [formula] Thus, [formula] is an edge of [formula] a contradiction to the fact that [formula] is a connected component of [formula]

Now, we are able to give a sufficient condition for a binomial to be indispensable of J by using our graphs [formula]

Given [formula] and let [formula] If [formula] then [formula] is an indispensable binomial of J.

Assume that [formula] Then, by Theorem [\ref=Thm_CombIndMonJ], both [formula] and [formula] are indispensable monomials of J. Let [formula] be a system of binomial generators of J. Since [formula] is an indispensable monomial, [formula] for some i. Thus [formula] and therefore [formula] is a vertex of [formula] Consequently, [formula] and we conclude that [formula] is an indispensable binomial of J.

The converse of the above proposition is not true in general: consider for instance the ideal [formula] then J is A-homogeneous for A  =  {1,1,1,1}. Both x - y and z - t are indispensable binomials of J, while [formula]

If [formula] is an indispensable binomial of IA, then f is an indispensable binomial of J.

Let [formula] By [\cite=OjVi2], if [formula] is an indispensable binomial of IA, then [formula] Since [formula] and [formula] are vertices of [formula] and [formula] is a subgraph of [formula] then [formula] and therefore, by Theorem [\ref=Thm_CombIndBinJ], we conclude that [formula] is an indispensable binomial of J.

Again we have that the converse is not true; for instance, x - y and z - t are indispensable binomials of J  =  〈x - y,y2  -  yt,z - t〉 and none of them is indispensable of the toric ideal IA.

We close this section by applying our results to show that the binomial edge ideals introduced in [\cite=Herzog10] have unique minimal system of binomial generators.

Let G be an undirected connected simple graph of the vertex set [formula] and let [formula] be the polynomial ring in 2n variables, [formula] [formula] over [formula]

The binomial edge ideal [formula] associated to G is the ideal generated by the binomials fij  =  xiyj  -  xjyi, with i  <  j, such that {i,j} is an edge of G.

Let [formula] be the binomial edge ideal associated to G. By definition, JG is contained in the determinantal ideal generated by the 2  ×  2 - minors of

[formula]

This ideal is nothing but the toric ideal associated to the Lawrence lifting, Λ(A), of [formula] (see, e.g. [\cite=Sturmfels95]). Thus, JG  ⊆  IΛ(A) and the equality holds if and only if G is the complete graph on n vertices. By the way, since G is connected, the smallest toric ideal containing JG has codimension n - 1. So, the smallest toric ideal containing JG is IΛ(A), that is to say, Λ(A) is the finest grading on [formula] such that JG is Λ(A) - homogeneous.

The binomial edge ideal JG has unique minimal system of binomial generators.

By [\cite=OjVi2], the toric ideal IΛ(A) is generated by its indispensable binomials, thus every fij∈JG, is an indispensable binomial of IΛ(A). Now, by Corollary [\ref=Cor_CombIndBinJ2], we conclude that JG is generated by its indispensable binomials.

The above result can be viewed as a particular case of the following general result whose proof is also straightforward consequence of [\cite=OjVi2] and Corollary [\ref=Cor_CombIndBinJ2].

Let [formula] be such that the monoid [formula] is free of units. If [formula] is a binomial ideal generated by a subset of the minimal system of binomial generators of IΛ(A), then J has unique minimal system of binomial generators.

Critical binomials, circuits and primitive binomials

This section deals with binomial ideals contained in the defining ideal of a monomial curve. Special attention should be paid to the critical ideal; this is due to the fact that the ideal of a monomial space curve is equal to the critical ideal, see [\cite=Herzog70]. Throughout this section [formula] is a set of relatively prime positive integers and [formula] is the defining ideal of the monomial curve [formula] in the n - dimensional affine space over [formula]

Critical binomials

A binomial [formula] is called critical with respect to xi if ci is the least positive integer such that [formula] The critical ideal of A, denoted by CA, is the ideal of [formula] generated by all the critical binomials of IA.

Observe that the critical ideal of A is A  -  homogeneous.

From now on and for the rest of the paper, we will write ci for the least positive integer such that [formula] for each [formula]

The monomials xcii are indispensable of IA, for every i. Equivalently, {xcii} is a connected component of Gb(IA), where b  =  ciai, for every i.

The proof follows immediately from Theorem [\ref=Th_OjVi1] and Theorem [\ref=Thm_CombIndMonJ].

The next proposition determines the indispensable critical binomials of the toric ideal.

Let [formula] be a critical binomial of IA, then f is indispensable of IA if, and only if, f is indispensable of CA.

By Corollary [\ref=Cor_CombIndBinJ2], we have that if f is indispensable of IA then it is indispensable of CA. Conversely, assume that f is indispensable of CA. Let [formula] be a system of binomial generators of IA not containing f. Then, by Proposition [\ref=Prop_critical0], [formula] for some l. So, fl is a critical binomial, that is to say, fl∈CA. Therefore, we may replace f by fl and f  -  fl∈CA in a system of binomial generators of CA, a contradiction to the fact that f is indispensable of CA.

If IA has unique minimal system of binomial generators, then CA does also has.

The monomials xcii are indispensable of IA, for each i (see Proposition [\ref=Prop_critical0]). Thus, for every i, there exists a unique binomial in IA of the form [formula] and we conclude that CA has unique minimal system of binomial generators.

Let A  =  {4,6,2a + 1,2a + 3} where a is a natural number. For a = 0, it is easy to see that IA does not have a unique minimal system of binomial generators. If a  ≥  1, then x24  -  xa1x2 and x24  -  x1x23∈CA. Thus CA is not generated by its indispensable and therefore IA does not have a unique minimal system of binomial generators.

Circuits

Recall that the support of a monomial [formula] is defined to be the set [formula] The support of a binomial [formula], denoted by [formula], is defined as the union [formula] We say that f has full support when [formula].

An irreducible binomial [formula] is called a circuit if its support is minimal with respect the inclusion.

Let [formula] The set of circuits in IA is equal to

[formula]

See [\cite=Sturmfels95]

The next theorem provides a class of toric ideals generated by critical binomials that, moreover, are circuits.

If [formula] then CA  =  IA.

From the hypothesis the binomial xcii  -  xci + 1i + 1 belongs to IA, for each [formula], so every circuit of IA is of the form xckk - xcll, since [formula]. Now, from Proposition 2.2 in [\cite=Villarreal], the lattice [formula] is generated by [formula] where [formula] is the vector with 1 in the i - th position and zeroes elsewhere. The rank of L equals n - 1 and a lattice basis is [formula] Thus CA is a lattice basis ideal. Let M be the matrix with rows [formula] then M is a mixed dominating matrix and therefore, from Theorem 2.9 in [\cite=Fischer], the equality CA  =  IA holds.

For n  =  4, a different proof of the above result can be found in [\cite=Bresinsky75].

The converse of Theorem [\ref=Th_Result] is not true in general (see, e.g., [\cite=Villarreal]).

If every critical binomial of IA is a circuit and the critical ideal has codimension n - 1, then ciai  =  cjaj, for every i  ≠  j. In particular, all minimal generators of IA have the same A  -  degree. This situation is explored in some detail in [\cite=RGS11] from a semigroup viewpoint.

The rest of this subsection is devoted to the investigation of necessary and sufficient conditions for a circuit to be indispensable of IA .

Let f  =  xui(j)i  -  xuj(i)j∈IA be a circuit and let b  =  ui(j)ai. Then there is no monomial [formula] in the fiber deg - 1A(b) such that [formula]

Let us suppose the opposite. Then, there exist xviixvjj∈ deg - 1A(b), that is to say, aiui(j)  =  ajuj(i)  =  aivi  +  ajvj. We have that [formula] and therefore ui(j) divides aj. Moreover no prime factor of ui(j) divides ai, so we conclude that either ui(j) divides vi or vi  =  0. Similarly, we obtain that either vj  =  0 or uj(i) divides vj. Hence, either vi = ui(j) and vj  =  0 or vj = uj(i) and vi = 0 and we are done.

Let f  =  xui(j)i  -  xuj(i)j∈IA be a circuit and let b  =  ui(j)ai. Then, f is indispensable of IA if, and only if, [formula] for every k  ≠  i,j. In particular, ui(j)  =  ci and uj(i)  =  cj.

First of all, we observe that [formula] and equality holds if, and only if, f is indispensable. So, the "only if" condition follows. Conversely, since [formula] the supports of the monomials in deg - 1A(b) are included in {i,j} and then, by Lemma [\ref=Lemma_Circuits2], we are done.

Observe that from the above result it follows that if a circuit is indispensable, then it is a critical binomial.

Let [formula] be an A  -  graded reverse lexicographical monomial order on [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] for every k  ≠  i,j.

Let f = xui(j)i  -  xuj(i)j∈IA be a circuit. Then, f is indispensable of IA if, and only if, it belongs to the reduced Gröbner basis of IA with respect to [formula]

If f is indispensable, then, from Theorem 13 in [\cite=OjVi2], it belongs to every Gröbner basis of IA. Now, suppose that f belongs to the reduced Gröbner basis of IA with respect to [formula] and it is not indispensable. Since f is not indispensable, there exists a monomial [formula] in the fiber of ui(j)ai different from xui(j)i and xuj(i)j. By Lemma [\ref=Lemma_Circuits2], we have that [formula] so there is [formula] and [formula]. Hence, both [formula] and [formula] belong to IA with [formula] and [formula] So, we conclude that f  =  xui(j)i  -  xuj(i)j∈IA is not in the reduced Gröbner basis of IA with respect to [formula] a contradiction.

Primitive binomials

A binomial [formula] is called primitive if there exists no other binomial [formula] such that [formula] divides [formula] and [formula] divides [formula] The set of all primitive binomials is called the Graver basis of A and it is denoted by Gr(A).

Let f = xuiixujj - xukkxull∈Gr(A) be such that ui  <  ci,uj  <  cj,uk  <  ck and ul  <  cl with i,j,k and l pairwise different. Then f is indispensable of [formula]

By [\cite=Sturmfels95], [formula] is the toric ideal associated to A'  =  {ai,aj,ak,al}. Thus, without loss of generality we may assume n = 4, then J  =  IA. First we will prove that the monomials xuiixujj and xukkxull are indispensable. By Theorem [\ref=Thm_CombIndMonJ] it is enough to prove that {xuiixujj} is a connected component of Gb(IA), where b  =  uiai  +  ujaj. Let [formula] be different from xuiixujj and xulkxull. If ui  <  vi, then xuii(xujj  -  xvi  -  uiixvjjxvkkxvll)∈IA, thus xujj  -  xvi  -  uiixvjjxvkkxvll∈IA which is impossible by the minimality of cj (see Proposition [\ref=Prop_critical0]). Analogously, we can prove that uj  ≥  vj,uk  ≥  vk and ul  ≥  vl. Therefore xviixvjj(xui - viixuj - vjj  -  xvkkxvll)∈IA and so xui - viixuj - vjj  -  xvkkxvll∈IA, a contradiction with the fact that f is primitive. The proof that xukkxull is indispensable is completely analogous. Finally, since b  =   deg A(xuiixujj)  =   deg A(xukkxull), we deduce that there is not a third vertex in Gb(J). Thus [formula] and, by Theorem [\ref=Thm_CombIndBinJ], we are done.

Let f = xuiixujj - xukkxull∈IA be such that ui  <  ci, uj  <  cj, uk > 0 and ul > 0 with i,j,k and l pairwise different. If xukkxull is indispensable of [formula] then f is indispensable of J.

Since, by Theorem [\ref=Thm_CombIndMonJ], {xukkxull} is a connected component of Gb(IA), where b  =  ukak  +  ulal, the monomial [formula] in the above proof has its support in {i,j}. Thus, repeating the arguments of the proof of Theorem [\ref=Th_indispensablebinom3], we deduce that ui  ≥  vi and uj  ≥  vj. But xuiixujj - xviixvjj∈IA, so uiai + ujaj = viai + vjaj which implies that ui = vi and uj = vj. By Theorem [\ref=Thm_CombIndBinJ] we have that f is indispensable of J.

Combining Theorem [\ref=Th_indispensablebinom3] with Corollary [\ref=Cor_CombIndBinJ2] we get the following corollary.

Given i,j,k and [formula] pairwise different, let J be the ideal of [formula] generated by all Graver binomials of IA of the form xuiixujj - xukkxull with ui  <  ci,uj  <  cj,uk  <  ck and ul  <  cl. Then J has unique minimal system of binomial generators.

Finally we provide another class of primitive binomials which are indispensable of a toric ideal.

Let f  =  xuiixujj  -  xukkxull∈Gr(A) such that 0  <  ui  <  ci and 0  <  uk  <  ck, for i,j,k and l pairwise different. If uiai  +  ujaj is minimal among all Graver A  -  degrees, then f is indispensable of [formula]

Since cjaj is a Graver A  -  degree, we have uiai  +  ujaj  ≤  cjaj, so it follows uj  <  cj. Similarly, we can prove ul  <  cl. Therefore, by Theorem [\ref=Th_indispensablebinom3], we conclude that f is indispensable of [formula]

Classification of monomial curves in [formula]

Let A  =  {a1,a2,a3,a4} be a set of relatively prime positive integers. First we will provide a minimal system of binomial generators for the critical ideal CA. This will be done by comparing the A-degrees of the monomials xcii, for [formula].

Let [formula] be a set of critical binomials of IA and let gl∈IA be a critical binomial with respect to xl. If fl  ≠    -  fi for every i, then gl∈〈f1,f2,f3,f4〉.

For simplicity we assume l = 1. Let g1  =  xc11  -  xv22xv33xv44∈IA be a critical binomial. If g1  =  f1, there is nothing to prove. If g1  ≠  f1, without loss of generality we may assume that u12  >  v2,u13  ≤  v3 and u14  ≤  v4, so g1  -  f1 = m1g2, with m1  =  xv22xu133xu144 and g2  =  xu12 - v22  -  xv3 - u133xv4  -  u144∈IA (in particular u12 - v2  ≥  c2). But

[formula]

and also f1  ≠    -  f2, thus from the minimality of c1 it follows that u21  =  0, that is to say, [formula] Now, by dividing g2 with f2, we obtain [formula] such that either g2  =  h2f2 or g2  -  h2f2  =  m2g3, with m2  =   - xv'33xv4  -  u144,g3  =  xv3 - u13 - v'33  -  xv'22xv'4  -  v4  +  u144 and v'2  <  c2, by interchanging the variables x3 and x4 if necessary. If g2  =  h2f2, then g1  =  f1  +  m1h2f2 and we are done. In the second case, since

[formula]

and f1  ≠   - f3, from the minimality of c1 it follows that u31  =  0, that is to say, [formula] Analogously, by dividing g3 with f3, we obtain [formula] such that either g3  =  h3f3 or g3  -  h3f3  =  m3g4, with m3  =   - xv'22xv''44,g4  =  xv'4  -  v4  +  u14 - v''44  -  xv''2 - v'22xv''33 and v''3  <  c3. If g3  =  h3f3, then g1  =  f1  +  m1h2f2  +  m1m2h3f3 and we are done. Otherwise, since

[formula]

[formula]

and f1  ≠   - f4, from the minimality of c1 it follows that u41  =  0, that is to say, [formula] Therefore, we have that f2,f3 and [formula] Taking into account that [formula] is generated by f2,f3 and f4 (see, e.g., [\cite=Sturmfels95] and [\cite=OjPis]), we conclude that g2  =  g21f2  +  g23f3  +  g24f4 and hence g1  =  f1  +  m1g21f2  +  m1g23f3  +  m1g24f4, with [formula]

Let [formula] be a set of critical binomials. If fi  ≠    -  fj for every i  ≠  j, then CA  =  〈f1,f2,f3,f4〉.

The proof follows directly from Lemma [\ref=Lemma_Critical1].

Observe that fi  =   - fj if and only if fi  =  xcii  -  xcjj and fj = xcjj  -  xcii; in particular, they are circuits. The following proposition provides an upper bound for the minimal number of generators of the critical ideal.

The minimal number of generators μ(CA) of CA is less than or equal to four.

Let [formula] be such that fi is critical with respect to xi. If fi  ≠   - fj, for every i  ≠  j, then we are done by Proposition [\ref=Prop_Critical1b]. Otherwise, without loss of generality we may assume f1  =   - f2, that is to say, f1  =  xc11  -  xc22. Suppose that F is not a generating set of CA. We distinguish the following cases: (1) f1 is indispensable of IA. Then there exists a critical binomial g∈IA with respect to al least one of the variables x3 and x4, say x4, such that g  ≠    ±  fi, for every i. By substitution of f4 with g in F we have, from Lemma [\ref=Lemma_Critical1], that every critical binomial with respect to x3 or x4 is in the ideal generated by the binomials of F. Consequently the new set F generates IA. (2) f1 is not indispensable of IA. Then there exists a critical binomial g∈IA with respect to al least one of the variables x1 and x2, for instance x2, such that g  ≠    ±  fi, for every i. We substitute f2 with g in F. If f3  ≠   - f4, then we have, from Proposition [\ref=Prop_Critical1b], that the new set F generates IA. Otherwise, we substitute f3 with a critical binomial h with respect to x3 in F such that h  ≠    ±  fi, for every i, when f3 is not indispensable. So, in this case, CA is generated by a set of 4 critical binomials.

If ciai  ≠  ckak and ciai  ≠  clal, where k  ≠  l, then either the only critical binomial of IA with respect to xi is f  =  xcii  -  xcjj or there exists a critical binomial f∈IA with respect to xi such that [formula] has cardinality greater than or equal to three.

Suppose the contrary and let fi  =  xcii - xujj∈IA where uj  >  cj. We define f  =  xcii - xviixuj - cjjxvkkxvll  =  fi  +  xuj - cjjfj∈IA with fj  =  xcjj  -  xviixvkkxvll∈IA. Now, from the minimality of ci it follows that vi  =  0, thus at least one of vk or vl is different from zero since fj∈IA. Therefore we conclude that [formula] has cardinality greater than or equal to 3, a contradiction. The cases fi  =  xcii - xukk∈IA and fi  =  xcii - xull∈IA are analogous.

After permuting the variables, if necessary, there exists a minimal system of binomial generators S of CA of the following form:

If ciai  ≠  cjaj, for every  i  ≠  j, then [formula]

If c1a1  =  c2a2 and c3a3  =  c4a4, then either c2a2  ≠  c3a3 and

[formula] when μ(CA) = 4

[formula] when μ(CA) = 3

S  =  {xc11  -  xc22,xc33  -  xc44} when μ(CA) = 2

or c2a2 = c3a3 and

S  =  {xc11  -  xc22,xc22  -  xc33,xc33  -  xc44}

If c1a1  =  c2a2  =  c3a3  ≠  c4a4, then [formula]

If c1a1  =  c2a2 and ciai  ≠  cjaj for all {i,j}  ≠  {1,2}, then

[formula] when μ(CA) = 4

[formula] when μ(CA) = 3

where, in each case, [formula] denotes an appropriate monomial whose support has cardinality greater than or equal to two.

First, we observe that our assumption on the cardinality of [formula] follows from Lemma [\ref=Lemma_Critical2]. Let J be the ideal generated by S. For the cases 1, 2(a-d), 3 and 4(a), it easily follows that J  =  CA by Proposition [\ref=Prop_Critical1b]. Indeed, in order to satisfy the hypothesis of Proposition [\ref=Prop_Critical1b], we may take f4  =  xc44  -  xc11∈J and f3  =  xc33  -  xc11∈J in the cases 2(d) and 3, respectively. The cases 2(b) and 4(b) happen when the only critical binomials of IA with respect to x1 and x2 are f1  =  xc11  -  xc22 and f2  =   - f1, respectively, then our claim follows from Lemma [\ref=Lemma_Critical1]. Finally, the case 2(c) occurs when the only critical binomials of IA are ±  (xc11  -  xc22) and ±  (xc33  -  xc44), so J  =  CA by definition.

On the other hand, since xcii is an indispensable monomial of IA, for every i, by Corollary [\ref=Cor_CombIndMinJ], we have that xcii is an indispensable monomial of the ideal J, for every i. Then, we conclude that S is minimal in the sense that no proper subset of S generates J.

Since CA  ⊆  IA, any minimal system of generators of IA can not contain more than 4 critical binomials. This provides an affirmative answer to the question after Corollary 2 in [\cite=Bresinsky88]. Notice that the only cases in which CA can have a unique minimal system of generators are 1, 2(c) and 4(b); in these cases CA has a unique minimal system of binomial generators if and only if the monomials [formula] are indispensable.

Now we focus our attention on finding a minimal set of binomial generators of IA, that will help us to solve the classification problem. The following lemma will be useful in the proof of Proposition [\ref=Prop_Critical3] and Theorem [\ref=Th_Main].

(i) If [formula] is a minimal generator of IA which is not critical, then there exists j  ≠  i such that [formula] and ciai  =  cjaj. Moreover, if [formula] is not indispensable, then ckak  =  clal, with {i,j,k,l}  =  {1,2,3,4}. (ii) If [formula] is a minimal generator of IA with ui  ≠  0 and uj  ≥  cj, then [formula] and ciai  =  cjaj. In addition, if [formula] is not indispensable, then ckak  =  clal, with {i,j,k,l}  =  {1,2,3,4}.

(i) Let b  =  ciai. Since f is not a critical binomial, we have that ui  >  ci. If ciai  ≠  cjaj, for every j  ≠  i, then, from lemma [\ref=Lemma_Critical2], there exists a critical binomial [formula] such that [formula] has cardinality greater than or equal to two. If [formula] then [formula] is a path in Gb(IA), a contradiction to the fact that f is a minimal generator by Theorem [\ref=Th_OjVi1]. Assume that [formula] It is enough to see the case that [formula] is a power of a variable, say [formula]. The monomial [formula] is not indispensable, so, from Theorem [\ref=Thm_CombIndMonJ], there exists a monomial [formula] such that [formula] has cardinality greater than or equal to 2 and also [formula]. Then [formula] is a path in Gb(IA), a contradiction. Thus ciai  =  cjaj, for an j  ≠  i. We have that [formula] otherwise [formula] is a path in Gb(IA), a contradiction again.

Finally, if [formula] is not indispensable, then, by Theorem [\ref=Thm_CombIndMonJ], there exists a monomial [formula] such that [formula] If [formula] then [formula] is a path in Gb(IA), a contradiction to the fact that f is a minimal generator. Moreover [formula] since if [formula] then [formula] is a path in Gb(IA). Thus [formula] and also xvkkxvll - xwkkxwll∈IA. Suppose that ckak  ≠  clal, then we may assume that for instance vk  >  ck. By using similar arguments as in the first part of the proof we arrive at a contradiction. Consequently ckak = clal(ii) The proof is an easy adaptation of the arguments used in (i).

For the rest of this section we keep the same notation as in Theorem [\ref=Thm_Critical2].

The following result was first proved by Bresinsky (see [\cite=Bresinsky88]), but our argument seems to be shorter and more appropriate in our context.

There exists a minimal system of binomial generators of IA consisting of the union of S and a set of binomials in IA with full support.

By Lemma [\ref=Lemma_Critical3] (i), if for instance [formula] is a minimal generator of IA which is not a critical binomial with respect to any variable, then ciai = cjaj, for j  ≠  i, and also [formula] is a minimal generator of IA. Moreover, either [formula] and [formula] so g has full support, or [formula] is a power of a variable, say [formula], with vk  >  ck. In this case, by using again Lemma [\ref=Lemma_Critical3] (i), we obtain a minimal generator h  =  g  +  xvk  -  ckk(xckk  -  xcll)  =  xui - ciixcjj - xvk  -  ckkxcll∈IA with [formula] Hence, there exists a system of generators of IA consisting of the union of a system of binomials generators of CA and a set S' of binomials in IA with full support. Furthermore, by Theorem [\ref=Thm_Critical2], we may assume that S is a system of binomials generators of CA.

Now, let [formula] and suppose that [formula] where every [formula] From the minimality of ci we have that [formula] and |gn| = 1, for some n. Then, according to the cases in Theorem [\ref=Thm_Critical2], either [formula] or [formula] is equal to xcjj, for some j  ≠  i. Now in the above expression of f the term xcjj should be canceled, so, from the minimality of cj, we have [formula] and |gm| = 1, for an m  ≠  n. Therefore, we conclude that either [formula] or [formula] is a subset of S. So, the only possible case is S  =  {xc11  -  xc22,xc22  -  xc33,xc33  -  xc44}. Since, in this case, IA  =  CA by Theorem [\ref=Th_Result], and [formula] we are done.

From the above proposition it follows that IA is generic (see, e.g. [\cite=Ojeda]) only in the case 1. The next theorem provides a minimal generating set for IA.

The union of S, the set I of all binomials xui1i1xui2i2  -  xui3i3xui4i4∈IA with 0  <  uij  <  cj, j  =  1,2, ui3 > 0, ui4 > 0 and xui3i3xui4i4 indispensable, and the set R of all binomials [formula] with full support such that

u1  ≤  c1 and xu33xu44 is indispensable, in the CASES 2(b) and 4(b).

u1  ≤  c1 and/or u3  ≤  c3 and there is no xv11xv22  -  xv33xv44∈IA with full support such that xv11xv22 properly divides xu1  +  αc11xu2  -  αc22 or xv33xv44 properly divides xu3  +  αu33xu4  -  αu44 for some [formula] in the CASE 2(c).

is a minimal system of generators of IA (up to permutation of indices).

By Proposition [\ref=Prop_Critical3], there exists a minimal system of binomial generators [formula] of IA such that S is a minimal system of generators of CA and [formula] for every f∈S'. Moreover, since all the binomials in the set I are indispensable by Corollary [\ref=Cor_indispensablebinom3], then [formula] where R is a set of binomials of IA of the form xui1i1xui2i2  -  xui3i3xui4i4 with uij  ≠  0, for every j, and uij  ≥  cj for some j.

Observe that if [formula] then the set defined in the statement of the theorem coincides with [formula] and therefore it is a minimal set of generators. So, we assume that [formula] that is to say, there exists a minimal generator xu11xu22  -  xu33xu44∈R with u2  ≥  c2 (by permuting variables if necessary). By Lemma [\ref=Lemma_Critical3] (ii) it holds that c1a1  =  c2a2, so in CASE 1 we have [formula] and therefore we are done. Moreover, if c2a2  =  ciai, for an i∈{3,4}, then [formula] is a path in Gb(IA), where b  =  u1a1  +  u2b2, a contradiction with Theorem [\ref=Th_OjVi1]. Therefore, we conclude that the theorem is also true in CASE 2(d) and CASE 3. Notice that, in the CASES 2(a) and 4(a), we can proceed similarly to reach a contradiction; indeed, since [formula] where [formula], then [formula] and therefore [formula] is a path in Gb(IA), a contradiction with Theorem [\ref=Th_OjVi1]. Thus [formula] in CASES 2(a) and 4(a), too.

Suppose now that xv11xvii  -  xv22xvjj∈R. By Lemma [\ref=Lemma_Critical3] (ii) again, we obtain that at least one of the equalities c1a1  =  ciai and c2a2  =  cjaj holds. But, as we proved above, these equalities are incompatible with the condition xu11xu22  -  xu33xu44∈R with u2  ≥  c2. Hence, all the binomials in R are of the form [formula] and x2 arises, with exponent greater than or equal to 2, in at least one of them.

We distinguish the following cases:

If there exists xv11xv22  -  xv33xv44∈R such that for instance v4  ≥  c4, then c3a3  =  c4a4 by Lemma [\ref=Lemma_Critical3] (ii). This is clearly incompatible with CASES 2(b) and 4(b), since [formula] is a path in Gd(IA), d  =  a1v1  +  a2v2, a contradiction with Theorem [\ref=Th_OjVi1]. Thus the binomials in R are of the form xu11xu22  -  xu33xu44 with ui  <  ci, i  =  3,4. If xu33xu44 is not indispensable, then there exists [formula] such that 0  <  vi  ≤  ui, for i  =  3,4, with at least one inequality strict and [formula] So, [formula] is a path in Gb(IA) where b  =  a3u3  +  a4u4, a contradiction with Theorem [\ref=Th_OjVi1]. Moreover, since xc11  -  xc22∈IA, we may change, if it is necessary, R by replacing every binomial xu11xu22  -  xu33xu44, where u1 > c1, with xu1  -  αc11xu2  +  αc22  -  xu33xu44∈IA such that 0  <  u1  -  αc1  ≤  c1 and u2  +  αc2  ≥  c2. Now the new set [formula] has the desired form. We have that

[formula]

so [formula] is a generating set of IA. To see that this is actually minimal, by indispensability reasons, it suffices to show that if xu11xu22  -  xu33xu44∈R and [formula] then xu11xu22  =  xv11xv22. Otherwise xu11xu22  -  xv11xv22∈IA, but 0  <  u1  ≤  c1 and v1  ≤  c1. Thus |u1  -  v1|  ≤  c1, so u1  =  c1,v1  =  0 and therefore v2  =  c2, since every binomial in [formula] with cardinality less than four is critical. We have that c1a1  +  a2u2  =  c2a2 and also c1a1  =  c2a2, so u2  =  0 a contradiction.

Now, by modifying R as in the previous case if necessary, we have that the binomials in R are of the following form: xu11xu22  -  xu33xu44 with 0  <  u1  ≤  c1,u2  ≠  0 and/or 0  <  u3  ≤  c3,u4  ≠  0. If there exist [formula] and xv11xv22  -  xv33xv44∈IA with full support such that xu1  +  αc11xu2  -  αc22  =  mxv11xv22 (or xu3  +  αc33xu4  -  αc44  =  mxv33xv44, respectively) with m  ≠  1, then [formula] (or [formula] respectively) is a path in Gb(IA), where b  =  u1a1  +  u2a2, a contradiction with Theorem [\ref=Th_OjVi1]. So, we conclude that all the binomials in R are of the desired form. Moreover, given f  =  xu11xu22  -  xu33xu44∈R and a monomial [formula] with [formula] then either v1  =  v2  =  0 or v1 = v3  =  v4  =  0 and v2 > c2. Indeed, since xu11xu22  -  xv11xv22xv33xv44∈IA, then

g  =  xu1 - v11xu2 - v22  -  xv33xv44∈IA, when v1  ≤  u1 and v2 < u2. If g has full support, then v1 = v2 = 0, otherwise [formula] If for instance u1 - v1  =  0, then u2 - v2  ≥  c2, because of the minimality of c2. Thus, g'  =  xu1 - v1 + c11xu2 - v2 - c22  -  xv33xv44∈IA. If g' has full support, then v1 = v2 = 0; otherwise the monomial xu1 - v1 + c11xu2 - v2 - c22 properly divides xu1 + c11xu2 - c22, that is to say, [formula] If g' does not have full support, say v3  =  0, then v4  ≥  c4 (due to the minimality of c4). So, we may define g''  =  xu1 - v1 + c11xu2 - v2 - c22  -  xc33xv4 - c44∈IA and conclude that v1  =  v2  =  0, as before.

g  =  xu1 - v11  -  xv2 - u22xv33xv44∈IA, when v1 < u1 and v2  ≥  u2. Since 0  <  u1  ≤  c1, we have that v1 = 0 and also u1 = c1. Thus v2 - u2  =  c2 and v3  =  v4  =  0, since xc11  -  xc22 is the only critical binomial with respect to x1.

g  =  xu2 - v22  -  xv1 - u11xv33xv44∈IA, when v1  ≥  u1 and v2 < u2. Now, by the minimality of c2, we have that u2  -  v2  ≥  c2 and therefore h  =  xc11xu2 - v2 - c22  -  xv1 - u11xv33xv44∈IA. So, either xc1 + u1 - v11xu2 - v2 - c22  -  xv33xv44∈IA, when c1  ≥  v1 - u1, or xu2 - v2 - c22  -  xv1 - u1 - c11xv33xv44∈IA, when c1  <  v1 - u1. In the first case we proceed as in (i), while in the other we repeat the same argument and so on. This process can not continue indefinitely, since there exists [formula] such that αc1  <  v1 - u1, and thus we are done.

From Theorem [\ref=Th_OjVi1] we have that there exists a minimal generator of A  -  degree deg A(f) for each f∈R. Furthermore, by direct checking one can show that all the binomials in [formula] have a different A  -  degree, and all these A  -  degrees are different from both c1a1 and c2a2. Thus, we conclude that [formula] is a minimal system of generators of IA.

Combining Theorem [\ref=Th_Main] with Corollaries [\ref=Cor_Critical] and [\ref=Cor_indispensablebinom3] yields the following theorem.

With the same notation as in Theorem [\ref=Th_Main], the ideal IA has a unique minimal system of generators if, and only if, CA has a unique minimal system of generators and [formula]

In [\cite=Ojeda], it is shown that there exist semigroup ideals of [formula] with unique minimal system of binomial generators of cardinality m, for every m  ≥  7.

Let A  =  {6,8,17,19}. The critical binomial x41 - x32 of IA is indispensable, while the critical binomial x24 - x1x42 is not indispensable. Thus we are in CASE 4(b). The binomial x21x32 - x3x4 belongs to R and therefore, from Theorem [\ref=Thm_Critical1], the toric ideal IA does not have a unique minimal system of binomial generators.

Let A  =  {25,30,57,76}, then the minimal number of generators of IA equals 8. The only critical binomials of IA are ±  (x61 - x52) and ±  (x43 - x34), so we are in CASE 2(c). The binomial x31x72 - x3x34 belongs to R and therefore, from Theorem [\ref=Thm_Critical1], the toric ideal IA does not have a unique minimal system of binomial generators.

Observe that IA is a complete intersection only in cases 2(b-d), 3 and 4(b). Moreover, except from 2(c), in all the other cases IA  =  CA. In the case 2(c) a minimal system of binomial generators is xc11  -  xc22,xc33  -  xc44 and xu11xu22  -  xu33xu44 where [formula] (see, [\cite=Delorme]).

It is well known that the ring [formula] is Gorenstein if and only if the semigroup [formula] is symmetric, see [\cite=Ku]. We will prove that if [formula] is symmetric and IA is not a complete intersection, then IA has a unique minimal system of binomial generators.

If f1 = xc11 - xu133xu144, f2 = xc22 - xu211xu244, f3 = xc33 - xu311xu322 and f4 = xc44 - xu422xu433 are critical binomials of IA such that [formula] has cardinality equal to 3, for every [formula], then IA has a unique minimal system of binomial generators.

We have that every exponent uij of xj is strictly less than cj, for each [formula]. If for instance u13  ≥  c3, then xc11 - xu311xu322xu13 - c33xu144 = f1 + xu13 - c33xu144f3∈IA and therefore xc1 - u311 - xu322xu13 - c33xu144∈IA, a contradiction to the minimality of c1. By Proposition [\ref=Prop_critical0] we have that ciai  ≠  cjaj, for every i  ≠  j. We will prove that every fi is indispensable of CA. Suppose for example that f1 is not indispensable of CA, then there is a binomial g = xc11 - xv22xv33xv44∈IA. So xu133xu144 - xv22xv33xv44∈IA and thus v3 < u13, v4 < u14 since u13 < c3 and u14 < c4. We have that xv22 - xu13 - v33xu14 - v44∈IA and also xc11 - xu211xv2 - c22xv33xu24 + v44 = g + xv2 - c22xv33xv44f2∈IA. Therefore xc1 - u211 - xv2 - c22xv33xu24 + v44∈IA, a contradiction to the minimality of c1. Analogously we can prove that f2, f3 and f4 are indispensable of CA. Thus CA is generated by its indispensable and therefore, from Theorem [\ref=Thm_Critical1], the toric ideal IA has a unique minimal system of binomial generators.

Let [formula] be a symmetric semigroup. If IA is not a complete intersection, then it has a unique minimal system of binomial generators.

From Theorem 3 in [\cite=Bresinsky75] the toric ideal IA has a minimal generating set consisting of five binomials, namely four critical binomials of the form defined in the above theorem and a non critical binomial. By Theorem [\ref=Cr1] the toric ideal IA is generated by its indispensable.

In higher embedding dimensions, the above result fails. In [\cite=Rosales] it is shown that the semigroup generated by A  =  {15,16,81,82,83,84} is symmetric. Since the monomials x111,x3x6 and x4x5 have the same A  -  degree, we conclude, by Theorem [\ref=Th_OjVi1], that the ideal IA does not have a unique minimal system of binomial generators.
