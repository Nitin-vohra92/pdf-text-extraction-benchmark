Quotients of Fano surfaces

Introduction.

It is classical to study quotients of surfaces by automorphism groups in order to obtain new surfaces. For example, Godeaux obtained one of the first surfaces of general type with vanishing geometric genus by taking the quotient of a quintic hypersurface in [formula] by an order 5 fixpoint free action. In this paper, we study quotients of Fano surfaces. These surfaces are by definition modular varieties : they parametrize the lines on smooth cubic threefolds. This modular property allows to understand them very well. In fact, we can handle the Fano surface S of a cubic threefold [formula] almost like a hypersurface in [formula]: we can think of F as giving the equation of S from which we can read of the properties of the irregular surface S. In particular, we can obtain the classification of the automorphism groups of these surfaces. In the present paper we study the minimal desingularisation of the quotients of these surfaces by some subgroups of automorphisms. We compute their Chern numbers c21,  c2, irregularity q and geometric genus pg, their minimality and their Kodaira dimension κ.

Using the classification of cyclic groups of prime order acting on cubic threefolds done in [\cite=Gonzalez], we give in the following table the classification of the minimal desingularisation of the quotients of Fano surfaces by groups of prime order, and we give examples of quotients by some automorphisms of order 4 and 15:

The first and second column give the order and type of the automorphism, the column g is the genus of the fibration onto the Albanese variety when it is an elliptic curve, the column Singularities gives the number and type of singularities on the quotient surface, Min indicates if the minimal desingularisation surface is minimal. For the surfaces which are quotient by the following groups G, we obtain:

Where [formula] is the dihedral group of order 2n. In each of the cyclic and non-cyclic cases, we obtain surfaces of all Kodaira dimensions : rational, abelian, minimal elliptic and of general type.

The rather exceptional fact that Fano surfaces are modular varieties enables us know exactly which singularities are on the quotient surface. Moreover, the situation is so good that we can determine the four invariants c21,c2,q,pg separately and then double-check our computations by using the Noether formula. We use intersection theory on singular normal surfaces as defined by Mumford in [\cite=Mumford]. In particular this intersection theory is applied in Propositions [\ref=Order_11] [\ref=Klein] and [\ref=pro:order_15] in order to find the Kodaira dimension of some surfaces, and we think that this has independent interest.

Although there are a lot of papers on the subject, the fine classification of surfaces of general type with small birational invariants in not achieved, in particular for the irregular ones. Let us discuss the place of the surfaces we obtain in the geography of surfaces of general type.

The surfaces of type I are discussed in [\cite=Takahashi]. Some examples of irregular surfaces with pg = 4 and birational canonical map are discussed in [\cite=Catanese3]. Our type II, III(1), III(2), III(3) surfaces have pg = 4 too. The surfaces of type II is discussed in [\cite=Catanese3], the surface III(3) is described in [\cite=Ikeda], but our examples III(1) and III(2) are, to our knowledge, new. We think also that the surfaces of type IV(1) and V are new.

The surface coming from the group G = S3 is a Horikawa surface [\cite=Horikawa]. The moduli space of surfaces coming from the group [formula] has recently be work out in [\cite=Gentile].

Our last example is a surface with K2 = pg = 1. In [\cite=Catanese1] and [\cite=Catanese2], Catanese study the moduli of such surfaces, obtaining counter examples to the global Torelli Theorem.

The paper is divided as follows: in the first section, we remind classical results from intersection theory and computation of invariants of quotient surfaces, in the second we recall the known facts about Fano surfaces and in the third and fourth, we compute the invariants of the resolutions of the quotient surfaces.

Generalities on quotients and intersection theory.

Let us recall, mainly without proof, some well-known Lemmas for computing the invariants of the minimal resolution of the quotient of a surface S by an automorphism group G.

We will use intersection theory of [formula]-Cartier divisors on compact normal surfaces as defined by Mumford [\cite=Mumford], a good reference on that topic is Fulton's book [\cite=Fulton]. Let Y be a normal surface and let g:Z  →  Y be a resolution of the singularities of Y. We denote by Ci,i∈I the irreducible reduced components of the exceptional curves of g. The intersection matrix (CiCj)i,j is negative definite. For a divisor C on Y let [formula] be the strict transform on Z of C. Let g*C and ai,i∈I be the [formula]-divisor and the positive rational numbers uniquely defined by:

[formula]

and the relations Cig*C = 0 for all i. The intersection number [formula] of C and C' is defined by g*Cg*C'. It is bilinear and independent of g. Let KY be the canonical [formula]-divisor on Y, then KZ  =  qY and:

Let [formula] be the canonical divisor of Z. Then:

[formula]

If all the components Ci of an exceptional divisor of the resolution Z  →  Y are ( - 2)-curves, then ai = 0 for all of those Ci.

Let us suppose that there exists a smooth surface S and a finite automorphism group G such that Y is the quotient of S by G and let π:S  →  S / G = Y be the quotient map. For each reduced divisor R on the surface S, let HR be the isotropy group of R:

[formula]

Let |E| denote the order of a set E ; |HR| is the ramification index of the quotient map π:S  →  S / G over R. For a curve C on S / G, we have [formula] and for another divisor C', we have:

[formula]

We say that the divisor C on Y = S / G is nef if [formula] for all curves C'. We have:

Let KS / G be the canonical [formula]-divisor on S / G. Then:

[formula]

in particular:

[formula]

If [formula] is nef, then KS / G is nef. If KS / G is nef and KZ = g*KS / G, then KZ is nef.

For any integer [formula] we define the stratum on S:

[formula]

where StabG(s) is the stabilizer of the point s in S. Using the inclusion-exclusion principle and the multiplicativity property of �tale maps for the Euler number e, we obtain:

The Euler number of S / G is given by the formula:

[formula]

The Euler number of the minimal resolution Z  →  S / G is the sum of e(S / G) and the number of irreducible components of the exceptional curves of Z  →  S / G.

Let ΩiX be the bundle of holomorphic i-forms on a smooth variety X and let [formula]. We denote the irregularity by qX and the geometric genus by pg(X).

Let Z be the minimal resolution of the surface S / G. We have:

[formula]

In particular: pg(Z) =  dim H0(S,ωS)G and qZ  =   dim H0(S,ΩS)G.

In [\cite=Griffiths] , pp. 349-354, Griffiths gives a definition of differential forms for singular varieties. This notion coincide with the usual one when the variety X is smooth and we have H0(Z,ΩiZ)≃H0(X,ΩiX) for any resolution of singularities Z of X. Moreover, by [\cite=Griffiths] formula (2.8), we have H0(S / G,ΩiS / G) = H0(S,ΩiS)G, therefore: H0(Z,ΩiZ) = H0(S,ΩiS)G.

Generalities on Fano surfaces.

Here we recall the known facts about Fano surfaces. We use mainly the results of Clemens-Griffiths [\cite=Clemens], Tyurin [\cite=Tyurin], [\cite=Tyurin1], Bombieri Swinnerton-Dyer [\cite=Bombieri] and also [\cite=RoulleauFanoSurfaceWith], [\cite=RoulleauGenus2], [\cite=RoulleauElliptic] and [\cite=RoulleauKlein].

Let [formula] be the Fano surface parametrizing the lines on a smooth cubic threefold [formula]. The Chern numbers of S are c21 = 45 and c2 = 27. For a point s in S, we denote by [formula] the corresponding line on F. There are 6 lines through a generic point of F. The closure Cs of the incidence :

[formula]

is an ample connected divisor of genus 11 on S, with at most nodal singularities. It has the property that if a plane cuts F into three lines Ls + Lt + Lu, then Ct + Cs + Cu is a canonical divisor KS. In particular 3Cs is numerically equivalent to KS and C2s = 5. The 5 dimensional space H0(ΩS)* is the tangent space of the Albanese variety Alb(S) of S. As the Albanese map of S is an embedding, we therefore consider the tangent space TS,s (for s in S) as a subspace of H0(ΩS)*. We have:

([\cite=Clemens], Tangent Bundle Theorem 13.37). There exists an isomorphism of vector spaces:

[formula]

such that for all s in S we have : H0(Ls,O(1)) = φ(TS,s).

In words : the tangent space to the point s, translated to the point 0 of Alb(S), is identified by the linear map φ to the plane subjacent to the line [formula]. This powerful Theorem has many important consequences:

([\cite=RoulleauElliptic], [\cite=RoulleauKlein]). Let σ be an automorphism of S, let dσ denotes its action on H0(ΩS)*. The element dσ acts naturally on the cubic F and a point s of S is a fixed point of σ if and only if the line Ls is stable under the action of dσ. If a point s is a fixed point of σ, the action of dσs:TS,s  →  TS,s is given by the restriction of dσ to the 2 dimensional vector space H0(Ls,O(1)). The map σ  →  dσ is an isomorphism between the automorphism groups of S and F.

The following Lemma enables us to compute the geometric genus and irregularity of the quotient surfaces:

([\cite=Clemens], (10.14)). The natural map is an isomorphism.

Let us fix some notations that we will use thereafter:

Let σ be an automorphism of S and let [formula] the eigenvalues of dσ. We denote by Vai the eigenspace in H0(F,O(1)) = H0(ΩS)* with eigenvalue ai, and by [formula] its projectivisation.

Now we can read on the cubic F which points are fixed by σ : they are the stable lines L in F under the action of dσ. Let n be the order of the automorphism σ. In general, we know the action of dσ on [formula] thus we know its action on H0(ΩS)* only up to a nth root of unity. But in our previous papers we computed these actions. Let us give an example. There is an obvious order two automorphism σ acting on the Fano surface of the cubic:

[formula]

The lines which are stable by σ are: i) the lines in the cone intersection of {x2 = 0} and F, parametrized by a smooth plane cubic curve [formula] ii) the 27 lines on the smooth intersection of F by {x1 = 0}. The automorphism dσ acting on H0(ΩS)* is :

[formula]

or - f. Let s be one of the 27 isolated points of σ. We have TS,s  ⊂  {x1 = 0} and as s is an isolated point of σ, dσs acts by x  →   - x on TS,s, therefore dσ = f. Such kind of order 2 automorphisms are called of type I ; their trace on H0(ΩS) is - 3. Let us recall:

([\cite=RoulleauElliptic], Thm. 13).There is a natural bijection between the set of elliptic curves [formula] on S and the set of involutions σE of type I. The intersection number of the curves E,E' is given by the formula:

[formula]

where o(g) denotes the order of an automorphism g. If s is a point on E, then Cs = E + Fs where Fs is the fiber over s of a fibration γE:S  →  E invariant by E, and such that the lines Lt,LσEt,LγEt in F are coplanar for all t in S.

There is another class of involutions acting on Fano surfaces, called of type II. The trace of their action on H0(ΩS) equals 1. An involution that is the product of two involutions of type I has type II.

([\cite=RoulleauGenus2], Thm. 3).The fixed point set of an involution of type II is the union of an isolated point t and a smooth genus 4 curve Rt. There exists a genus 2 curve Dt on S such that

[formula]

The curve Dt is smooth or sum of two elliptic curves which intersect in t. Let σ,  σ',... be involutions of type II generating a group such that all involutions have type II. The intersection number of the curves Rt,Rt'... is given by the formula:

[formula]

where o(f) is the order of the element f. For the intersection DtDt', we have: DtDt' = RtRt' - 1.

We denote by [formula] a basis of the space H0(ΩS) of global sections of the cotangent sheaf and by [formula] the dual basis.

Quotients by cyclic groups.

Let σ be an automorphism of a Fano surface S. We denote by π:S  →  S / σ the quotient map and by g:Z  →  S / σ the minimal resolution of S / σ.

Let [formula] be an elliptic curve and let σ  =  σE be the corresponding type I involution. The fixed point set of σ is the union of the smooth elliptic curve E and 27 points.

The surface S / σ contains 27  A1 singularities. The resolution Z of S / σ is minimal and has invariants:

[formula]

The Albanese variety of Z is E and the natural fibration Z  →  E has genus 3 fibers.

There is a natural fibration γ:S  →  E invariant under σE such that for all s in E, we have Cs = E + Fs with Fs the fiber of γ at s. The divisor π*KS / σ = KS - E = Cs + Cσs + Fγs is ample, therefore KZ = g*KS / σ is nef and

[formula]

The invariant sub-spaces of [formula] and H0(S,ωS) by σE have dimension and that implies that c2 = 54. A fiber Fs of γ has genus 7 ; as FsE = 4, the quotient fiber Fs  /  σE has genus 3.

The fibers of the Albanese fibration of Z are genus 3 curves. In [\cite=Takahashi], Takahashi prove that surfaces with q = 1, [formula] and Albanese fibers of genus 3 are canonical i.e.. their canonical map is birational.

Let σ an involution of S of type II. The fixed point set of σ is the union of a point t and a smooth genus 4 curve Rt.

The minimal resolution Z of the quotient surface S / σ is minimal and has invariants :

[formula]

The image of t on the surface Z / σ is a node. We have:

[formula]

As e(Rt) =  - 6, we get e(Z) = 12. Moreover, we have :

[formula]

The other invariants are easily computed. Let Dt be the residual divisor such that Ct = Dt + Rt. Let [formula] denotes the numerical equivalence. As [formula] is nef, KS / σ is nef and [formula] is nef, therefore Z is minimal.

A smooth polarisation Θ of type (1,1,2) on an Abelian Threefold has the same invariants as the surface Z, see [\cite=Catanese3].

Let be a primitive third root of unity. Let σ be an order 3 automorphism of S such that the eigenvalues of dσ acting on H0(ΩS) are (automorphism of type III(1)).

The automorphism σ has no fixpoints. The quotient surface S / σ = Z is smooth, minimal, and has invariants:

[formula]

Up to a change of coordinates, the cubic can be written as:

[formula]

with C a cubic form. As F is smooth, there are no lines into the intersection of F and the plane [formula]. Moreover, there are no lines in F going through the points [formula] and [formula] therefore the automorphism σ has no fixed points and the surface S / σ = Z is smooth. We have moreover: [formula] thus KZ is ample. As π is �tale [formula] and [formula]. Since the action of σ on is known, we can compute the other invariants.

In view of [\cite=Catanese3], where Catanese and Schreyer discuss about irregular surfaces with pg = 4, we collect further informations on the surface Z.

Let w1,  w2∈H0(ΩS) be two linearly independent 1-forms on S. Recall that by the Tangent Bundle Theorem, the canonical divisor associated to the form [formula] parametrizes the lines on [formula] that cut the plane [formula].

A basis of the σ-invariant canonical forms on S is [formula]. Thus, a point s in S is a base point of the corresponding 3 dimensional linear system if the line Ls cuts the 4 planes: x1 = x2 = 0, x3 = x4 = 0, x3 = x5 = 0, x4 = x5 = 0. But this is impossible, therefore the system is base point free and the canonical system of Z too.

The Albanese map of Z is not a fibration (by [\cite=Clemens], there is no fibration of a Fano surface onto a curve of genus > 1). It would be interesting to study deeper Z in the spirit of [\cite=Catanese3], in particular we can ask if the canonical map is birational.

Let σ be an order 3 automorphism of S such that the eigenvalues of dσ acting on H0(ΩS) are (α2,α2,α,α,1) (automorphism of type III(2)).

The singularities of the quotient are cusps . The minimal resolution Z of this surface has invariants:

[formula]

and is minimal. The fibers of the fibration onto the Albanese variety have genus 4.

Up to a change of coordinates, σ acts on the cubic:

[formula]

The lines [formula] and [formula] and the point [formula] are not contained on F. The stable lines are the 9 lines on F that cut the disjoint lines and . Let s be one of the fixed points of σ. The eigenvalues of dσ acting on TS,s are therefore the image of s on the quotient surface S / σ is a A2 singularity, resolved by a chain of 2 ( - 2)-curves. We have:

[formula]

moreover [formula] and e(Z) = 33. Let us compute the genus of the fibers. By [\cite=RoulleauFanoSurfaceWith] Cor. 26, there is a fibration of S onto an elliptic curve E, invariant by σ and with fibers F of genus 10. Therefore the quotient surface S / σ has a fibration S / σ  →  E by fibers of genus 4.

By using the same method as for surfaces of type III(1), we see that the canonical system of Z has no has point. Again, it would be interesting to study deeper Z in the spirit of [\cite=Catanese3].

Let σ be an order 3 automorphism of S such that the eigenvalues of dσ acting on H0(ΩS) are (α2,α,α,α,α) (automorphism of type III(3)). The space [formula] is a hyperplane, [formula] is one point outside F. The hyperplane [formula] cuts F into a smooth cubic surface Y, therefore σ fixes isolated points.

The quotient Y / σ has 27  A3,1 singularities. Its minimal resolution Z has invariants

[formula]

Up to the change of coordinates, the cubic F has equation

[formula]

with G a cubic form. The surface Z is studied by Ikeda [\cite=Ikeda] ; it is the resolution of the double cover of the smooth cubic surface Y = {G = 0}, ramified along the intersection of Y with its Hessian. By [\cite=Ikeda], the surface Z is a minimal surface, its canonical system is base point free and the image of the canonical map is Y.

The automorphism dσ acts on the hyperplane Vα by multiplication by α, therefore it acts on the tangent space TS,s of an isolated fixed point s by multiplication by α and the resulting singularity on S / σ is a A3,1. We have:

[formula]

and [formula] with Ei the ( - 3)-curves over the A3,1 singularities. Therefore

[formula]

The computation of q = 0 and pg = 4 is immediate.

Let σ be an order 3 automorphism of S such that the eigenvalues of dσ are (automorphism of type III(4)). Then [formula] is a plane and [formula] is a line. The family of lines going through the plane [formula] and the line [formula] is the union of 3 disjoint elliptic curves.

The quotient map π:S  →  S / σ is a triple cover branched over 3 elliptic curves of the blow-up in three points of an abelian surface.

See [\cite=RoulleauFanoSurfaceWith].

Let σ be an order 4 automorphism of S such that the eigenvalues of dσ acting on H0(ΩS)* are - 1, - 1,1,i, - i.

The quotient surface contains 6 nodes and one A3 singularity. The minimal resolution Z of S / σ is minimal and has invariants:

[formula]

The fibers of the natural fibration of Z onto its Albanese variety have genus 4.

Up to a change of coordinates, the automorphism

[formula]

acts on the cubic:

[formula]

where [formula] and P is a polynomial such that P(σ1,σ2,σ3) is homogenous of degree 3 in the variables xj. The basis of V- 1, V- i, Vi and V1 are respectively: and The line through [formula] and is on F, this is also the unique isolated stable line Lt of σ2, involution of type II. There are three lines on F are going trough the line [formula] and the point and three other lines through the line [formula] and the point . These 6 lines correspond to the intersection points of Dt and Rt, where Ct = Rt + Dt are as in Proposition [\ref=pro:_Involution_type_II]. Their images on S / σ are nodes. As the eigenvalues of dσ acting on [formula] are ( - i,i), the image of t on S / σ is an A3 = A4,3 singularity, resolved by 3 ( - 2) curves. Let us compute the Euler number:

[formula]

thus e(Z) = 18. The quotient map π is ramified with index 2 over Rt, thus KS  =  π*KS / ν + Rt. The divisor KS - Rt = 2Ct + Dt is nef, therefore KS / σ is nef and KZ = g*KS / σ is nef, thus Z is minimal, moreover:

[formula]

It is immediate to check that q = 1 and pg = 2. By [\cite=RoulleauFanoSurfaceWith], Theorem 18, there exists a σ-invariant fibration S  →  E onto an elliptic curve with generic fibers D of genus 13 and Rt is contained in a fiber, therefore D  →  D / σ is �tale and the fiber D / σ has genus 4.

In [\cite=Takahashi], Takahashi constructed all canonical surfaces with q = 1 and K2 = 3pg with [formula]. The fibers of the Albanese fibration of such surfaces are genus 3 curves. As far as the author knows, the above surface Z seems new on the line of surfaces with q = 1 and K2 = 3pg (the fibers of the Albanese fibration of Z have genus 4).

Let σ be an order 4 automorphism of S such that the automorphism σ:x  →  (ix1,ix2,ix3, - ix4,x5) acts on the cubic threefold F.

The quotient surface S / σ contains 12 nodes and 3 singularities A3. The minimal resolution Z of S / σ is a minimal properly elliptic surface with invariants:

[formula]

Up to a change of coordinates, the cubic is:

[formula]

The point [formula] is the vertex of a cone in F whose basis is an elliptic curve [formula]. The automorphism σ2 is a type I involution, fixing E and 27 isolated points. A point s on E correspond to a line

[formula]

and such a line is stable under σ, therefore E is fixed by σ. The space [formula] is the tangent space to E in the Albanese variety of S, therefore, as σ fixes E, the automorphism dσ is equal to x  →  (ix1,ix2,ix3, - ix4,x5) (the eigenvalues of dσ acting on H0(ΩS)* are i,i,i, - i,1). The line through [formula] and [formula] is not on F and there are 3 lines going through [formula] and that cut the plane [formula] these three lines are among the 27 isolated fixed lines of σ2 and give 3A3 singularities. The images on S / σ of the remaining 24 isolated fixed points of σ2 are 12 nodes. We have

[formula]

and e(Z) = 36. Let be γE:S  →  E be the σ2-invariant fibration, associated to E. It is also σ-invariant. Let Fs be the fiber over s. Then π*KS / σ = KS - 3E is numerically equivalent to 3Fs, therefore [formula]. Moreover, as Fs is nef, KZ is nef and then Z is minimal. The invariants q = 1,  pg = 3 are readily computed.

Let σ be an order 5 automorphism of S such that the eigenvalues of dσ acting on H0(ΩS)* are (1,ξ,ξ2,ξ3,ξ4), with a primitive root of unity.

The quotient surface S / σ has 2A4 singularities. The minimal resolution Z of S / σ is minimal and its invariants are:

[formula]

The general fiber of the Albanese map of Z has genus 4.

Up to a change of coordinates, the cubic is given by:

[formula]

and σ acts by:

[formula]

The eigenspace Vξk is generated by ek. The lines through two points and contained in are the line through and and the line through and The eigenvalues of are and the eigenvalues of are and therefore the images of w,w' on S / σ are 2A4 singularities. We have :

[formula]

thus e(Z) = 15. As KS / σ is ample, KZ is nef. Moreover [formula]. By [\cite=RoulleauGenus2], Thm. 3 D), there exists a fibration [formula] onto an elliptic curve [formula] that is invariant by σ and with fibers of genus 16. We deduce that the general fiber of the Albanese map of Z has genus 4.

Let Z be the resolution of the quotient of the Fano surface S of the Klein cubic:

[formula]

by the order 11 automorphism σ acting on F by:

[formula]

where ξ is a 11th primitive root of unity (S is unique to have an order 11 automorphism, see [\cite=RoulleauKlein]).

The invariants of the surface Z are:

[formula]

The surface S / σ contains 5 singularities A11,3.

Let us denote by Lij the line xs = xt = xu = 0 where {i,j,s,t,u}  =  {1,2,3,4,5}. The lines on F that are stable by σ are L13,L23,L25,L45,L14. The 5 corresponding fix points sij on S give 5 singularities A11,3 on S / σ resolved by curves Aij,Bij with (Aij)2 =  - 3,  (Bij)2 =  - 4 and AijBij = 1. We have:

[formula]

with [formula] thus K2Z =  - 5. The Euler number is:

[formula]

Moreover, we check immediately that the invariants subspaces of H0(S,ΩS) and H0(S,ωS) by σ are trivial, therefore the quotient surface has q = pg = 0.

The surface Z is rational.

Let us prove the existence of a smooth rational curve C such that C2 = 0 on a blow-down of Z. Let us denote by Cij the incidence divisor for the stable line Lij corresponding to the fixed point sij. The automorphism σ acts on Cij. Using the equation of F, we see that among the 5 fixed points of σ, the curve C13 contains s14 and s23 and moreover, as the line L13 is double (there is a plane X such that XF = 2L13 + L14), the point s13 is on C13. The permutation τ = (1,2,4,3,5) acts on the Klein cubic threefold and with the order 11 automorphism σ, it generates an order 55 group such that the group generated by σ is distinguished. By these order 5 symmetries, we therefore know which fixed points of σ are on the curve Cij (τ acts on the indices of the Cij,sij etc...). Any incidence divisor C is a double cover of a plane quintic Γ that can be explicitly computed using [\cite=Bombieri], equation (6). For the divisor C13, the corresponding quintic Γ has equation:

[formula]

in the plane with coordinates x2,x4,x5. The curve Γ has only one nodal singularity, and therefore by [\cite=Bombieri] Lemma 2, the curve C13 has only one nodal singularity. By using the order 5 symmetry τ, the same property holds for the all the Cij. Let Dij be the reduced image by the quotient map π of Cij and let ij the strict transform of Dij in Z by the minimal resolution g:Z  →  S / σ. We can write:

[formula]

for aij,bij rational. Let be [formula] [formula]. We have [formula] therefore [formula] thus aij,bij are positive integers. Using the order 5 symmetry, we get:

[formula]

Moreover [formula] thus

[formula]

Let us define (a23,b23)M = ( - 11u1, - 11u2) with u1,u2 positive integers. We have:

[formula]

as [formula] we get 1225 = 0 and a14u1 + b14u2 = 5. Taking care of [formula] we get the following 8 possibilities for (a14,b14,u1,u2):

[formula]

Thus (a14,b14,a23,b23) is one of the following:

[formula]

Using the order 5 symmetry τ = (1,2,4,3,5), we get:

[formula]

We have [formula] therefore:

[formula]

Moreover:

[formula]

As above, let us define (a14 + a23,b14 + b23)M = ( - 11w1, - 11w2) with w1,w2 positive integers. We obtain :

[formula]

As a13w1 + b13w2 = 5, we get the following possibilities with respect to the 4 above pairs (w1,w2):

[formula]

but as [formula] is an integer, the only solution is (a13,b13) = (1,3), (w1,w2) = (2,1) and (a14,b14,a23,b23) equals (4,1,5,4) or (5,4,4,1). We obtain that: 213 =  - 1 and KZ13 =  - 1 and by symmetry, the curves ij are 5 disjoint ( - 1)-curves. Let us suppose that (a14,b14,a23,b23) is (5,4,4,1), then:

[formula]

We have A13ij = 0,0,1,1,0 and B13ij = 1,0,0,1,0, moreover:

[formula]

The images of A13 and A45 by the blow-down map of the five ij are two ( - 1)-curves A'13 and A'45 such that A'13A'45 = 1 therefore, as Z is regular, it is a rational surface. In the same way, if we suppose that (a14,b14,a23,b23) is (4,1,5,4), we obtain that the surface Z is rational.

Let S be the Fano surface of the cubic:

[formula]

The order 15 automorphism:

[formula]

(μ15 = 1) acts on S.

The surface S / σ contains 5A3,1 + 2A15,4 singularities. The minimal resolution Z of S / σ has invariants:

[formula]

The automorphism σ fixes 2 isolated points s14,s23 (corresponding to the lines [formula] and [formula]) and acts on their tangent spaces by the diagonal matrix with diagonal elements (μ4,μ) giving 2A15,4 singularities denoted by a and b. The singularity a is resolved by two ( - 4)-curves Ta,Ua such that TaUa = 1, the singularity B is resolved by Tb,Ub with the same configuration. The automorphism σ5 fixes 27 isolated points (lines in the hyperplane x5 = 0) and acts on the tangent space at these points by multiplication by μ5. The points s14,s23 are among theses 27 points. The other 25 fixed points of σ5 gives 5A3,1 singularities on S / G resolved by 5 ( - 3)-curves Ti. We have : q = pg = 0. For the Euler number:

[formula]

and [formula]. For the canonical bundle:

[formula]

thus K2Z =  - 4.

The surface Z is rational.

In order to prove the Proposition, we will prove the existence of a smooth rational curve C such that C2 = 0 on a blow-down of Z. The 27 stable lines under the action of σ5 are on the cubic surface [formula]. Their corresponding points on S are denoted by:

[formula]

and their configuration is as follows: The two points e1 and g1 are fixed by σ and the corresponding lines Le1 and Lg1 ([formula] and [formula]) are skew. The images of e1 and g1 on S / G are denoted by a and b. The other points ei and gi are such that [formula] is a double six. The [formula] and [formula] are orbits of σ whose images on S / G are denoted by f and g. Each point [formula] on S is the isolated fixed point of a type II involution that is the product of two type I involution, therefore each incidence divisor Cfij splits:

[formula]

for E,E' the two elliptic curves that cut each other in fij and with Rij the residual divisor. Each of the 10 elliptic curves E as above contains exactly 3 fixed points and these points are among the fij (intersection of E by 3 other elliptic curves, see [\cite=RoulleauElliptic]). We denote by A and B the image of Ce1. We can denote by [formula] the ten elliptic curves on S. Their configuration is given by EijEst = 1 if |{i,j,s,t}| = 4, EijEst = 0 if |{i,j,s,t}| = 3, E2ij =  - 3. The divisors E1 = E12 + E23 + E34 + E45 + E15 and E2 = E13 + E24 + E35 + E14 + E25 are two orbits of σ and we denote by H,L their images on S / G. We denote by m,n,p the images of the 15 points fij (3 orbits) : m = {f12,f13,f14,f15,f16}, n = {f23,f34,f45,f56,f26}, p = {f24,f35,f46,f25,f36}. We have a,g,m∈A, b,f,m∈B. On S / σ, we have:

[formula]

and [formula]. The curve H (resp. L) is nodal in n, (resp. p) and H,L cut each other in m transversally. Let Tm,Tn,Tp be the ( - 3)-curves over m,n,p and let , be the proper transform of H,L. Then:

[formula]

therefore 2  =  2 =  - 2 and  = 0. As KZ = KZ = 0, the curves [formula] and [formula] are two ( - 2)-curves. Since a,g,m∈A and A is nodal in a, we have:

[formula]

where Ta and Ua are the 2 ( - 4)-curves over a. Therefore: Ā2 =  - 1 and as KZĀ =  - 1, Ā is a ( - 1)-curve. We have:

[formula]

In the same way:

[formula]

is a ( - 1)-curve and Ā = 0, moreover:

[formula]

Consider the curves Ā,,Tm,,. They are smooth rational curves and their intersection matrix is:

[formula]

By blowing down four times, we obtain a smooth rational curve C such that C2 = 0. As q = 0, the surface Z is rational.

Quotients by non-cyclic groups.

Let us now study quotients by non-cyclic groups G. We denote by π:S  →  S / G the quotient map and by g:Z  →  S / G the minimal desingularisation.

Let E,E' be 2 genus 1 curves on S such that EE' = 1 and let [formula] be the group generated by the involutions of type I σE,  σE'. We have:

The quotient S / G has 24 nodes. The minimal resolution Z is minimal and has invariants:

[formula]

An equation of F is:

[formula]

The involution σEσE' has type II and fixes the intersection point t of E and E' and the divisor Rt such that Ct = E + E' + Rt. The involution σE fixes E and 27 points, 3 of them are on E' ; the symmetric situation holds for σE'. The images on S / G of these [formula] isolated fixed points of G are smooth points. The 24 singular points of S / G are nodes, and the quotient map is ramified with order 2 over the curve Ct, therefore [formula] and KS / G is ample, moreover:

[formula]

The irregularity is 0 and pg = 3, therefore c2 = 43.

Let σ1,σ2 be 2 involutions on type II such that σ3  =  σ1σ2 is a third involution of type II. They generate a group G isomorphic to [formula].

The surface Z = S / G is smooth and has invariants:

[formula]

The surface Z is the blow up in three points p1,p2,p3 of an abelian surface such that there exist 3 genus 2 curves R'i that cuts each other in the three point pi. The map π:S  →  Z is a [formula]-cover, branched over the strict transform of the three curves Ri'.

An equation of F is:

[formula]

Each involution σi fixes an isolated point ti and a smooth genus 4 curve Ri and we have RiRj = 1, R2i =  - 3, KSRi = 9. The action of the group G on H0(ΩS) is generated by diagonal matrices with diagonal elements ( - 1, - 1,1,1,1), (1, - 1, - 1,1,1). Therefore the invariant subspaces H0(ΩS)G and H0(S,ωS)G have dimension q = 2 and pg = 1. The lines x3 = x4 = x5 = 0, x1 = x4 = x5 = 0, x2 = x4 = x5 = 0, corresponds to the isolated fix points ti of the σi. For [formula], the point ti is a non-isolated fixed point of σj because the eigenvalues of d(σj)ti acting on TS,ti are ( - 1,1). That implies that the images on S / G of the 3 points ti are smooth points and that S / G = Z is smooth. The quotient map S  →  S / G is ramified only over the 3 curves Ri. Let Di be the genus 2 curve such that Cti = Di + Ri. We have :

[formula]

and:

[formula]

We deduce that c2 = 3. As RiRj = 1, the 3 divisors Ri are the edges of a triangle, with ti the vertex opposite to the edge Ri. The involution σi induces an involution of Rj that fixes only two points ti,tk ({i,j,k}  =  {1,2,3}). The quotient R'i = Ri / G has therefore genus 2. As σi(tj) = tj, the involution σi acts on the incident divisor Ci = Di + Ri. As [formula] the curve D'i = Di / G has genus g such that :

[formula]

and g = 0. Moreover 4(D'i)2 = (π*D'i)2 = D2i =  - 4 and D'i is a ( - 1)-curve. As [formula] and q = 2, we see that the minimal model of Z is an Abelian surface.

Let us study the quotient of S by the group [formula] generated by by automorphisms a,b such that the eigenvalues of and db are respectively (α2,α,1,1,1) and (1,1,α2,α,1).

The surface S / G contains 6 cusps. The minimal resolution Z of the quotient surface S / G is minimal and has invariants:

[formula]

The fibers of the fibration of Z onto its Albanese variety have genus 2.

An equation of F is:

[formula]

The automorphisms a,a2,b,b2 have no fixed points. The automorphisms ab,a2b2 fix 9 isolated points, and also a2b,ab2. That gives 6 cusps singularities on S / G. As these singularities are resolved by ( - 2)-curves, we have:

[formula]

moreover: [formula] therefore e(Z) = 19. The invariant subspaces H0(ΩS)G and H0(S,ωS)G are easily computed. By [\cite=RoulleauGenus2], there is a fibration γ:S  →  E of S onto an elliptic curve that is invariant by G and with fibers F of genus 10. Thus the Albanese fibration of Z has fibers of genus [formula]. As KS is ample, and KS  =  π*KS / G, we see that KS / G is ample ; as KZ = g*KS / G, the canonical divisor KZ is nef and Z is minimal.

Recently the moduli space M of surfaces with c21 = 5,  q = 1,  pg = 2 has been studied by Gentile, Oliviero and Polizzi [\cite=Gentile]. They give a stratification of M and prove that M has at least 2 irreducible components. It would be interesting to know in which component and strata the surface Z belongs.

Let G be the permutation group S3 generated by two involutions σE,σE' such that EE' = 0. The order 3 automorphism τ  =  σEσE' has no fixed-points (type III(1)). Let be E'' = σE(E') = σE'(E). Let g:Z  →  S / G be the minimal desingularisation of S / G.

The surface Z is the resolution of the 27 nodes on S / G and has invariants:

[formula]

it is a minimal Horikawa surface with c2 = 5c21 + 30.

An equation of F is :

[formula]

Each involution of type I fixes 27 isolated points and these points are not fixed by the 2 other involutions, therefore the surface S / G contains 27 nodes. Let F,F',F'' be fibers of γE,γE',γE'', then:

[formula]

is nef ; as K' = π*KS / G, KS / G is nef thus KZ = g*KS / G is nef. Moreover:

[formula]

It is easy to check that q = 0 and pg = 3. Let us compute the Euler number:

[formula]

As there are 27 nodes on S / G, e(Z) = 18 + 27 = 45.

Let S be a Fano surface and let σ1,σ2 be 2 involutions of type II acting on S and generating a group G isomorphic to the dihedral group [formula] with the involution σ1σ2σ1 of type II.

The minimal resolution Z of the quotient surface S / G has invariants:

[formula]

It is a minimal properly elliptic surface. The surface S / G contain 3 cusps and one node.

The representation of [formula] on H0(ΩS) splits into the sum of twice the unique 2 dimensional irreducible representation [formula] and the trivial representation T (see [\cite=RoulleauGenus2], Section 3.3 for an equation), therefore q = 1. The representation of [formula] on H0(S,ωS) is [formula] where D is the determinantal representation, thus pg = 1. The element σ  =  σ1σ2 is a type III(2) automorphism that fixes 9 points si. There are 3 involutions of type II in G, each of them fixes a curve Ri and an isolated point ti. The image of the ti is a A1 singularity on S / σ. Let Di be the divisor on S such that Cti = Di + Ri. We have RiRj = 3 for [formula]. This gives 3 fixed points, say s1,s2,s3, for the whole group G and the images of the points [formula] are two cups on S / σ. The representation of the group G on the tangent space of points s1,s2,s3 is isomorphic to [formula], their images are smooth points on the surface S / G. As S / G has only nodal singularities or cusps, we have K2Z = K2S / σ. By [\cite=RoulleauGenus2], we have DiDj = 2, R2i =  - 4, KSRi = 6, and [formula] is a fiber of a fibration γ:S  →  E onto an elliptic curve E. As

[formula]

we obtain that [formula] and we deduce that c2 = 12. The fibration γ is moreover invariant by [formula] thus for a generic fiber Fs of γ, the curve [formula] is a fiber of the Albanese map of Z. The quotient [formula] is ramified over [formula] points ; as [formula] the genus of [formula] is equal to 1. As there is a fibration by elliptic curves on S, it has Kodaira dimension less or equal to 1, and since pg = 1,c2 = 12, it is a minimal properly elliptic surface.

Let S be a Fano surface and let [formula] be the dihedral group acting on it, such that the order 2 elements have type II.

The minimal resolution Z of the quotient surface [formula] has invariants:

[formula]

The surface [formula] contains a unique nodal singularity. The surface Z is a ruled surface of genus 1.

We can take the group generated by the permutations a = (1,2,3,4,5) and b = (1,3)(4,5) acting on the basis vectors [formula] of [formula] by permutation of the indices. The vectors [formula] are eigenvectors of a, moreover [formula] and [formula] are a basis of eigenvectors for the eigenvalue 1 (resp - 1) under the action of a (resp. b). The lines corresponding to [formula] and [formula] are the only ones contained into the cubic F among the points [formula] ([formula]) in the grassmannian G(2,5). We deduce that s1 and s2 are fixed points for the whole group [formula]. On the tangent space of s1 the action of [formula] is given by x  →  (ξx1,ξ4x2) and x  →  (x2,x1). The invariant ring by this action is [formula] therefore the image of the si are smooth points. As the eigenvalues of dbs1 acting on TS,s1 are (1, - 1), the fixed curve of b goes through it.

The representation of [formula] on H0(ΩS) splits into the trivial representation and the the sum of two 2 dimensional non-isomorphic representations [formula] and [formula] therefore q = 1. The representation of [formula] on H0(S,ωS) is [formula] where D is the determinantal representation, thus pg = 0. The group [formula] contains 5 order 2 elements of type II, each fixes an isolated point ti and a smooth genus 4 curve Ri, that gives one A1 singularity of [formula]. As RiRj = 2 for [formula] we deduce that the curves Ri cut each other in s1 and s2. Moreover :

[formula]

therefore:

[formula]

and as K2Z = K2S / G, we obtain: K2Z =  - 2. Let us compute the Euler number:

[formula]

As we have only one A1 singularity : e(S) = 2. The divisor [formula] is a connected fiber of genus 16 of a fibration γ:S  →  E onto an elliptic curve. This fibration is invariant by [formula] (see [\cite=RoulleauGenus2], Theorem 3). The quotient map [formula] for Fu a generic fiber is ramified over [formula] points, thus the genus of the quotient curve [formula] is 0.

Let S be a Fano surface with automorphism group containing two involutions of type I σE,σE' with product of order 3 and commuting with a type III(1) automorphism σ.

The minimal resolution Z of the quotient surface S / G is minimal and has invariants:

[formula]

Up to a change of coordinates, the cubic can be written as:

[formula]

The fixed points of the three involutions of type I are 3 disjoint elliptic curves E,E',E'' and 81 isolated points, divided into 9 orbits of 9 elements, giving 9A1 singularities. The [formula] isolated points of the 2 type III(2) automorphisms gives 3A2 singularities on S / G. We check easily that q = 0 and pg = 1, moreover:

[formula]

for K' = KS - E - E' - E'' and we deduce that c2 = 23. As K' = F + F' + F'' (for F,F',F'' fibers of γE,γE',γE'') is nef, Z is minimal.
