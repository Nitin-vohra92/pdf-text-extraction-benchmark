Quadruple-peaked Spectral-line Profile

Stellar shells are observed in almost half of elliptical and S0 galaxies that live in a low galactic density environment, see e.g. [\cite=col01]. They are thought to be by-products of galaxy mergers [\cite=quinn84]. The most regular shell systems are believed to result from a nearly minor radial merger in which the satellite galaxy is dissolved by tidal forces and its stars begin to oscillate in the potential of the host galaxy at close-to-radial orbits. The stars accumulate at their turning points and create shells.

The shape of line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD) in the vicinity of the shell edge for a stationary shell was studied by [\cite=mk98]. They predicted a double-peaked spectral-line profile and proposed to use spectroscopy to probe the dark matter distribution of a galaxy that contains shells using the profiles of stellar absorption lines.

Nevertheless, shells are not stationary features: stars of the satellite galaxy have a continuous energy distribution, and therefore the shell edge is, at different times, made of stars of different energies, as they continue to arrive at their respective turning points. Thus, the shell front moves outwards from the center of the host galaxy with its velocity given by the mass distribution of the host galaxy. Therefore, both of the original double peaks in the spectral line are split into two, resulting in a quadruple-peaked shape [\cite=ji10]. Taking the shell's velocity and the cumulative mass of the host galaxy to be constant near the edge of the shell, we found an approximate analytical description for the positions of the peaks in the LOSVD (for details see [\cite=eb11]).

To study the LOSVD more in detail we carried out a test-particle simulation of a radial merger of dwarf (dE) and giant elliptical (gE) galaxies, leading to a formation of shells. The potential of the gE galaxy is represented with a luminous de Vaucouleurs sphere and an NFW dark halo. See Fig. [\ref=fig:ebrova21] for comparison of LOSVD from simulation and the analytical approximation. If the velocity maxima were measured, the approximation could be used to constrain the mass distribution of the host galaxy.
