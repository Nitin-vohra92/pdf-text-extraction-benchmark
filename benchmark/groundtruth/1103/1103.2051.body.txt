It is well-known that, for integers p and q with 1 / p + 1 / q < 1 / 2, the hyperbolic plane [formula] can be tessellated by regular p-gons with q p-gons meeting at each vertex. This is called a tessellation of type {p,q}. The group of all orientation-preserving symmetries of a tessellation of type {p,q} is a Fuchsian group, and a tessellation of [formula] by fundamental domains for this group is obtained by subdividing each of the regular p-gons in the original tessellation into p triangles sharing a vertex at its centre.

The question we deal with here is whether the p-gons themselves are fundamental domains for some Fuchsian group. Equivalently, one can ask for which p and q does there exist a subgroup of the full group of symmetries of the tessellation of type {p,q} which acts freely and transitively on the set of p-gons in the tessellation? The following result answers this question.

The tessellation of type {p,q} is a tessellation of the hyperbolic plane by fundamental domains of some Fuchsian group if and only if q has a prime divisor less than or equal to p.

The proof of this theorem can be broken into two Lemmas.

The tessellation of type {p,q} is a tessellation of the hyperbolic plane by fundamental domains of some Fuchsian group if and only if there exists an involution σ in Sp (the symmetric group on p letters) such that (σρ)q = 1, where ρ is the cyclic permutation [formula] of order p.

Let us fix a p-gon F in the tessellation. Let [formula] be the vertices of F, labeled clockwise from some arbitrary vertex v1. Let e1 denote the edge between vp and v1, and let ei denote the edge between vi - 1 and vi for [formula].

First, let us prove the necessity of the combinatorial condition. Suppose that F is a fundamental domain for some Fuchsian group Γ. For each of the p p-gons adjacent to F, there is a unique element of Γ which maps it onto F. This induces the well-known edge-pairing for a (polygonal) fundamental domain--namely, for each edge ei of F there is a unique non-identity element γi∈Γ and a unique edge of F, which we will denote by eσ(i), such that γi maps eσ(i) onto ei. Note that we do not exclude the possibility that ei = eσ(i), in which case γi is a rotation about the midpoint of ei by π.

Since γ- 1i maps ei onto eσ(i), we see that γ- 1i  =  γσ(i) and eσ(σ(i)) = ei. Thus the edge-pairing of F provides an involution σ∈Sp. We now prove the relation between σ and ρ by considering the q images of F about any vertex vi.

Consider any edge ei of F. The adjacent edge of F which shares the vertex vi is eρ(i), where ρ is the cyclic permutation defined in the statement of the theorem. By the definition of σ, γσρ(i)F is the p-gon adjacent to F in the tessellation which shares the edge eρ(i), and γσρ(i)vσρ(i)  =  vi. The edge of γσρ(i)F which is adjacent to γσρ(i)eσρ(i) and shares the vertex vi is γσρ(i)eρσρ(i). Noting that γσρ(i)γσρσρ(i)γ- 1σρ(i) maps the edge γσρ(i)eσρσρ(i) of γσρ(i)F to γσρ(i)eρσρ(i), we see that γσρ(i)γσρσρ(i)F is the p-gon adjacent to γσρ(i)F sharing the edge γσρ(i)γσρσρ(i)eσρσρ(i)  =  γσρ(i)eρσρ(i). Continuing in this manner anti-clockwise about the vertex vi, we obtain

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since F was assumed to be a fundamental domain for Γ, the first equality shows that

[formula]

and thus the latter gives

[formula]

This holds for any [formula], and hence (σρ)q = 1.

Conversely, suppose we have an involution σ∈Sp with (σρ)q = 1. We generate the group Γ by using the edge-pairing isometries described by σ. Specifically, let γi be the unique orientation-preserving isometry of the hyperbolic plane which maps the edge ei onto eσ(i) (and does not map F onto itself). Now let Γ be the subgroup of the full group of symmetries of the tessellation of type {p,q} which is generated by [formula]. Note that we immediately have the relation γ- 1i  =  γσ(i). We need to show that Γ acts freely and transitively on the set of p-gons in the tessellation.

For any γ∈Γ, the p-gon adjacent to γF and sharing the edge γei is γγσ(i)F. Furthermore, the generator γσ(i) which appears in this context is clearly unique as such amongst the generators [formula]. This observation yields a one-to-one correspondence between words in these generators (not using inverses) and paths in the dual graph of the tessellation beginning at F. The correspondence associates the word [formula] to the path passing successively through the p-gons

[formula]

Furthermore, two such paths are homotopic in the dual graph (relative to their endpoints) if and only if their corresponding words can be made equal using only the relations γiγσ(i)  =  1.

The connectedness of the dual graph now immediately implies the transitivity of Γ acting on the set of p-gons of the tessellation. It remains to demonstrate the freeness of this action. In the context of the dual graph, it needs to be shown that every path beginning and ending at F corresponds to a word which multiplies in Γ to give the identity element.

Using the arguments from the first part of the proof, one can observe that the hypothesis (σρ)q = 1 is precisely the condition that the word corresponding to the path around any given vertex vi of F multiplies in Γ to give the identity. Let us call these "primitive paths". To complete the proof one only needs to observe that any path in the dual graph which begins and ends at F can be written as a concatenation of conjugates of these primitive paths.

Theorem [\ref=thm] is now reduced to a combinatorial problem.

There exists an involution σ∈Sp such that (σρ)q = 1 if and only if q has a divisor [formula] which is less than or equal to p.

If (σρ)q = 1 then q is a multiple of the order of σρ, which is greater than one and divides p!. This proves necessity.

For sufficiency, suppose m  ≤  p is a divisor of q. We will explicitly construct an involution σ∈Sp such that σρ has order m. Put

[formula]

for integers a and r with 0  ≤  r  <  m. Note that [formula] since m  ≤  p. Now define σ as the following product of disjoint transpositions:

[formula]

This formula should be interpreted using the convention that if a = 1 then the first product is empty, and if r = 0 then the second product is empty. Calculation reveals that the product σρ decomposes as the following product of disjoint m-cycles:

[formula]

The arguments above are not particular to hyperbolic geometry. The results hold equally in the Euclidean case (1 / p + 1 / q = 1 / 2) and the spherical case (1 / p + 1 / q > 1 / 2), where the Fuchsian group is replaced by a discrete group of orientation-preserving isometries of [formula] or S2, respectively. However, this does not add anything significant to the result since there are only finitely many such regular tessellations. In fact, one finds that all such regular tessellations of the plane and sphere are realisable as tessellations by fundamental domains of some discrete group of orientation preserving isometries with one exception -- the icosahedron (type {3,5}).
