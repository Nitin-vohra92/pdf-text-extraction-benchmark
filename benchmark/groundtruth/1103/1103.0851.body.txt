The general situation

Let [formula] be a connected split reductive algebraic group over [formula] whose derived group [formula] is simply connected. Let [formula] be the center of G and let S be the maximal [formula]-split torus in Z. Let C∞ be a maximal compact subgroup of [formula] and let [formula]. The connected component of the identity of K∞ is denoted [formula] and [formula] Let [formula] be an open compact subgroup; here [formula] is the adèle ring of [formula] and [formula] is the ring of finite adèles. The locally symmetric space of G with level structure Kf is defined as

[formula]

(For the following see Harder [\cite=harder-book] for details.) For a dominant integral weight λ, let Eλ be an absolutely irreducible finite-dimensional representation of [formula] with highest weight λ, and let Eλ denote the associated sheaf on SGKf. We have an action of the Hecke-algebra [formula] on the cohomology groups [formula]

We always fix a level, but sometimes drop it in the notation. For any finite extension [formula] let [formula], then Eλ,F is the corresponding sheaf on SGKf.

Let S̄GKf be the Borel-Serre compactification of SGKf, i.e., [formula], where the boundary is stratified as [formula] with P running through the conjugacy classes of proper parabolic subgroups defined over [formula]. The sheaf Eλ,F on SGKf naturally extends, using the definition of the Borel-Serre compactification, to a sheaf on S̄GKf which we also denote by Eλ,F. Restriction from S̄GKf to SGKf in cohomology induces an isomorphism [formula]

Our basic object of interest is the following long exact sequence of π0(K∞)  ×  H-modules

[formula]

The image of cohomology with compact supports inside the full cohomology is called inner or interior cohomology and is denoted [formula]. The theory of Eisenstein cohomology is designed to describe the image of the restriction map r*. Our goal is to study the arithmetic information contained in the above exact sequence.

The inner cohomology is a semi-simple module for the Hecke-algebra. (See Harder [\cite=harder-book].) After a suitable finite extension [formula] where [formula] we have an isotypical decomposition

[formula]

where πf is an isomorphism type of an absolutely irreducible H-module, i.e., an F-vector space Hπf with an absolutely irreducible action of H. The local factors Hp are commutative outside a finite set V = VKf of primes and the factors Hp and Hq, for p  ≠  q, commute with each other. Hence for [formula] the commutative algebra Hp acts on Hπf by a homomorphism πp:Hp  →  F. Let Hπp be the one dimensional vector space F with basis 1∈F with the action πp on it. Then [formula] The set of isomorphism classes which occur in the above decomposition is called the 'spectrum' Coh(G,Kf,λ). If we restrict the elements of the Galois group [formula] to F we get the conjugate embeddings of F into ; we introduce [formula] For ι∈I(F) define [formula] as [formula]. We define the rationality field of πf as [formula]

The case of GLn and the definition of relative periods when n is even

Let [formula] be a maximal [formula]-split torus in G, let [formula] Let X*(T) be its group of characters then restriction of characters gives an inclusion [formula] and after tensoring by [formula] this becomes an isomorphism. Any λ∈X*(T) can be written as [formula]

Consider the case [formula] Take a regular essentially self-dual dominant integral highest weight λ. Let [formula] be half the sum of positive roots, and write [formula] which is an equation in [formula]; the [formula] restrict to the fundamental weights in X*(T(1)) and are trivial on the center Z. Regular, dominant and integral mean that ai  ≥  2 are integers, and essentially self-dual means ai = an - i. Further, for such a weight λ we have [formula] and it satisfies the parity condition:

[formula]

where [formula] is the 'motivic weight'; see below.

Given such a λ, there is a unique essentially unitary Harish-Chandra module Hπλ∞ such that the relative Lie algebra cohomology group [formula] Let [formula] denote the discrete spectrum for [formula] in the space of L2-automorphic forms with level structure Kf on which [formula] acts via the inverse of the central character of Eλ. For πf∈Coh(G,Kf,λ) and ι∈I(F) we consider

[formula]

which is one-dimensional due to multiplicity-one for the discrete spectrum of GLn; the image is in fact in the cuspidal spectrum by regularity of λ. (See, for example, Schwermer [\cite=schwermer].) We choose a generator Φ for [formula]

The summand [formula] can be decomposed for the action of [formula] as

[formula]

The action of [formula] is via its action on [formula] (See, for example, Borel-Wallach [\cite=borel-wallach].) Therefore, we get

[formula]

Let bn  =  n2 / 4 if n is even, and (n2 - 1) / 4 if n is odd. Since π is cuspidal, it is well-known (see, for example, Clozel [\cite=clozel]) that πλ∞ is irreducibly induced from essentially discrete series representations and that

[formula]

where each piece on the right hand side is one-dimensional, and ε is a canonical sign (see [\cite=raghuram-shahidi-imrn]).

Now let n be even. We will define certain periods that we call relative periods. We define consistent choices of generators

[formula]

from which we get isomorphisms

[formula]

Composing the inverse of one with the other gives a canonical transcendental isomorphism

[formula]

This isomorphism does not depend on the choice of Φ or the pair (ω+,ω-) because these are unique up to scalars which cancel out. On the other hand we have an arithmetic isomorphism of HGKf-modules

[formula]

which is unique up to an element in [formula] Comparing ([\ref=eqn:trans]) with ([\ref=eqn:arith]) we get the following definition.

There is an array of complex numbers [formula] defined by

[formula]

Changing Tarith(πf) by an element [formula] changes the array into [formula]

If we pass from λ to λ  -  l  ·   det for an integer l, then we have a canonical isomorphism

[formula]

under which the ±   components are switched by ( - 1)l. We get the following period relation:

[formula]

The case [formula] with n even and n' odd

Let σf∈Coh(GLn,λ) and σ'f∈Coh(GLn',λ'). The level structures will be suppressed from our notation from now on. As before, the weights are written as [formula] and similarly [formula] where ai = an - i, [formula], and again we assume regularity for both the weights. Let [formula], [formula] and πf  =  σf  ×  σ'f. By the Künneth formula we get

[formula]

Using Grothendieck's conjectural theory of motives, one supposes that there are motives [formula] (resp., [formula]) that are conjecturally attached to σf (resp., σ'f). (See, for example, [\cite=motives].) We call a pair of integers (p,q) a Hodge-pair for a motive [formula] if the Hodge number [formula]. The Hodge-pairs of the motives [formula] (resp., [formula]) are expected to be [formula] (resp., [formula]) where [formula] (resp., [formula]) are the motivic weights. The motives [formula] (resp., [formula]) are suitable Tate-twists of the motives expected to be attached to σf (resp., σ'f) as in Clozel [\cite=clozel]. The assertion about Hodge pairs may be verified by working with the representations at infinity and their associated local L-factors which determine the Γ-factors at infinity. The set of Hodge-pairs for [formula] are all the pairs of the form [formula]

The motivic L-function [formula] is defined as in Deligne [\cite=deligne]. Intimately related to it is a 'cohomological' L-function [formula] which is defined as an Euler product, where each Euler factor is expressed in terms of eigenvalues of certain normalized Hecke-operators acting on integral cohomology groups. Assume that the middle Hodge number of [formula] is zero, i.e., [formula] Put [formula] Let [formula] denote the contragredient of [formula] The critical points of [formula] are the integers

[formula]

Note that this decreasing list of integers is centered around [formula] which is the center of symmetry of the cohomological L-function. The total number of critical integers is [formula]. The cohomological L-function is up to a shift in the s-variable the usual automorphic Rankin-Selberg L-function [formula] for which the functional equation is between s and 1 - s. More precisely, we have

[formula]

where a(μ)  =  d - d'. The parity condition ([\ref=eqn:parity]) when applied to both the weights λ and λ' implies that the shift in [formula] in the s-variable is always a half-integer. Observe that the cohomological L-function is invariant under changing σ to [formula] or σ' to [formula]

A celebrated conjecture of Deligne predicts the existence of two periods [formula] obtained from the Betti and de Rham realizations of this motive that capture, up to prescribable powers of (2πi), the possibly transcendental parts of the critical values of [formula]. See [\cite=deligne] for a precise statement. Our main result on L-values is to be viewed from this perspective.

The main result on ratios of critical L-values

Let σf∈Coh(GLn,λ) and σ'f∈Coh(GLn',λ'). Assume that n is even and n' is odd. Let [formula] be a half-integer such that both m and m + 1 are critical for [formula] Assuming the validity of a combinatorial lemma (see below) we have

[formula]

for any ι∈I(F). Moreover, for all [formula]

[formula]

Here εσ' is a sign determined by σ', εm  =  ( - 1)m0 and [formula] is the completed Rankin-Selberg L-function.

See the main theorem of Harder [\cite=harder-rank-one] for the simplest nontrivial case (n = 2 and n' = 1) of the above theorem.

Eisenstein cohomology and sketch of proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]

Consider the group [formula] where N  =  n + n'  ≥  3 is an odd integer. Let P (resp., Q) be the standard maximal parabolic subgroup of [formula] whose Levi quotient is [formula] (resp., [formula]). We will try to find a highest weight , such that [formula] occurs as isotypical summand in the cohomology of the boundary [formula] Recall our notation that bN  =  (N2 - 1) / 4, hence bN  =  bn  +  bn'  +   dim(UP) / 2. Therefore, we need a dominant weight [formula] and a Kostant representative w∈WP (defined as in Borel-Wallach [\cite=borel-wallach]) of length l(w) =  dim(UP) / 2 such that [formula] We believe, having checked it in infinitely many cases (n = 2 or n' = 1), that the following assertion is true.

Assuming that μ satisfies the condition in the combinatorial lemma, we know that there is a [formula] such that

[formula]

and it is actually an isotypical subspace. Hence, there is a Hecke-invariant projector Rπf to this subspace. The theory of Eisenstein cohomology gives a description of the image of the restriction map

[formula]

Our main result on Eisenstein cohomology is the following:

The image of [formula] is given by

[formula]

where ψ is any class in Hbn + bn'!(SMP,Eμ,F)(πf) with [formula]; the operator Tarith(πf,ι) is defined as [formula] after using the Künneth-formula; C(μ) is a non-zero rational number; and the point of evaluation is [formula] (Note that [formula])

Theorem [\ref=thm:eisenstein] implies the rationality result stated in Theorem [\ref=thm:main] for m  =   - N / 2 because the ratio of L-values together with the period is the 'slope' of a rationally defined map. For an integer l, let us change σ to [formula], then λ changes to λ  -  l  ·   det and a(μ) changes to a(μ) - l, however the possibilities for l are restricted by the inequalities in the Combinatorial Lemma since [formula] and p(μ) do not change. It may be verified using ([\ref=eqn:critical]) that as a(μ) runs through all the possible values it can take as prescribed by the Combinatorial Lemma, the pair of numbers ν0 and ν0 + 1 run through all the successive critical arguments; Theorem [\ref=thm:main] follows while using the period relations ([\ref=eqn:period-relations]) for σf. The Combinatorial Lemma says that the theory of Eisenstein cohomology allows one to prove a rationality result for a ratio of successive L-values exactly when both the L-values are critical. (See also  [\cite=harder-gln].)

The condition on μ imposed by the Combinatorial Lemma has certain strong implications on the situation that underlies Eisenstein cohomology. First, using Speh's results (see, for example, [\cite=moeglin]) on reducibility for induced representations for [formula], one sees that the representation [formula] of [formula] obtained by un-normalized parabolic induction is irreducible. Next, using Shahidi's results [\cite=shahidi-duke85] on local factors and the fact that ν0 and ν0 + 1 are critical, we deduce that the standard intertwining operator A∞ from the above induced representation to the representation similarly induced from Q∞ is both holomorphic and nonzero at s  =  ν0. The choice of bases ω± fixes a basis for the one-dimensional space [formula] The map induced by A∞ at the level of [formula]-cohomology is then a nonzero scalar. This scalar is a power of (2πi) times a rational number C(μ). The power of (2πi) gives the ratio of L-factors at infinity hence giving us a statement for completed L-functions, and the quantity C(μ) is expected to be a simple number as was verified for GL3 by Harder [\cite=harder-rank-one].
