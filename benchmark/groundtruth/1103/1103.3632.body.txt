The geometry of Hrushovski constructions, II. The strongly minimal case.

Introduction

In this paper, we investigate the isomorphism types of combinatorial geometries arising from Hrushovski's flat strongly minimal structures and answer some questions from Hrushovski's original paper [\cite=EH]. It is a sequel to [\cite=MFDE1], but can be read independently of it. In order to describe the main results it will be convenient to summarise some of the results from the previous paper.

Suppose L is a relational language with, for convenience, all relation symbols of arity at least 3 and at most one relation symbol of each arity. Denote by k(L) the maximum of the arities of the relation symbols in L (allowing k(L) to be ∞   if this is unbounded). The basic Hrushovski construction defines the predimension of a finite L-structure to be its size minus the number of atomic relations on the structure. The class C0(L) consists of the finite L-structures in which this is non-negative on all substructures. There is then an associated notion of dimension d and the notion of self-sufficiency (denoted by ≤  ) of a substructure. All of this is reviewed in detail in Section 2 below. The class (C0,  ≤  ) has an associated generic structure M0(L) which also carries a dimension function d giving it the structure of an infinite-dimensional pregeometry. The associated (combinatorial) geometry is denoted by G(M0(L)).

In [\cite=MFDE1] we showed that:

The collection of finite subgeometries of G(M0(L)) does not depend on L (Theorem 3.8 of [\cite=MFDE1]).

For languages L,L', the geometries G(M0(L)) and G(M0(L')) are isomorphic iff the maximum arities k(L) and k(L') are equal. (Theorem 3.1 of [\cite=MFDE1] for ⇐ and see also Section 4.2 here; Theorem 4.3 of [\cite=MFDE1] gives ⇒  .)

The localization of G(M0(L)) over any finite set is isomorphic to G(M0(L)) (Theorem 5.5 of [\cite=MFDE1]).

For the strongly minimal set construction of [\cite=EH], one takes a certain function μ (see section 2 here) and considers a subclass Cμ(L) of C0(L). For appropriate μ there is a generic structure Mμ(L) for the class (Cμ(L),  ≤  ) which is strongly minimal. The dimension function given by the predimension is the same as the dimension in the strongly minimal set and we are interested in the geometry of this. Our main result here is that this process of 'collapse' is irrelevant to the geometry: under rather general conditions on μ we prove:

The geometry G(Mμ(L)) of the strongly minimal set is isomorphic to the geometry G(M0(L)) (Theorem [\ref=main]).

Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of Hrushovski's paper [\cite=EH] give variations on the construction which produce strongly minimal sets with geometries different from the G(M0(L)). However, we show, answering a question from [\cite=EH] (see also Section 3 of [\cite=Hasson]):

the geometries of the strongly minimal sets in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of [\cite=EH] have localizations (over a finite set) which are isomorphic to one of the geometries G(M0(L)) (for appropriate L) (see Section 4.1 here).

The first version of the result in (4) was proved by the second Author in his thesis [\cite=MFThesis]: this was for the case where L has a single 3-ary relation symbol (as in the original paper [\cite=EH]). The somewhat different method of proof used in Sections 3 and 4 here was found later. It has the advantage of being simpler and more readily adaptable to generalization and proving the result in (5), however, the class of μ-functions to which it is applicable is slightly more restricted than the result from [\cite=MFThesis]: Theorem 6.2.1 of [\cite=MFThesis] assumes only that μ  ≥  1.

In summary, for each [formula] we have a countably-infinite dimensional geometry Gk isomorphic to G(M0(L)) where L has maximum arity k, and these are pairwise non-isomorphic. The geometry of each of the new (countable, saturated) strongly minimal sets in [\cite=EH] has a localization isomorphic to one of these Gk. Thus, whilst there is some diversity amongst the strongly minimal structures which can be produced by these constructions, the range of geometries which can be produced appears to be rather limited. It would therefore be very interesting to have a characterization of the geometries Gk in terms of a 'geometric' condition (such as flatness, as in 4.2 of [\cite=EH], for example) and a condition on the automorphism group (such as homogeneity, but possibly with a stronger assumption).

We thank the Referee for drawing our attention to the need to consider local isomorphisms in Theorem [\ref=main].

Hrushovski constructions

We give a brief description of Hrushovski's constructions from [\cite=EH]. Other presentations can be found in [\cite=FW] and [\cite=B&S]. The book [\cite=AP2] of Pillay contains all necessary background material on pregeometries and model theory. The notation, terminology and level of generality is mostly consistent with that used in [\cite=MFDE1].

Predimension and pregeometries

Let L be a relational language consisting of relation symbols (Ri:i∈I) with Ri of arity ni  ≥  3 (and |I|  ≥  1). We suppose there are only finitely many relations of each arity here.

We work with L-structures A where each each Ri is symmetric: so we regard the interpretation RAi of Ri in A as a set of ni-sets. (By modifying the language, the arguments we give below can be adapted to deal with the case of ni-tuples of not-necessarily-distinct elements: see Section 4.3 here.)

For finite A we let the predimension of A be [formula] (of course this depends on L but this will be clear from the context).

We let C0(L) be the set of finite L-structures A such that δ(A')  ≥  0 for all A'  ⊆  A.

Suppose A  ⊆  B∈C0(L). We write A  ≤  B and say that A is self-sufficient in B if for all B' with A  ⊆  B'  ⊆  B we have δ(A)  ≤  δ(B'). We will assume that the reader is familiar with the basic properties (such as transitivity) of this notion.

Let 0(L) be the class of L-structures all of whose finite substructures lie in C0(L). We can extend the notion of self-sufficiency to this class in a natural way.

Note that if A  ⊆  B∈0(L) is finite then there is a finite A' with A  ⊆  A'  ⊆  B and δ(A') as small as possible. In this case A'  ≤  B and it can be shown that there is a smallest finite set C  ≤  B with A  ⊆  C. We define the dimension dB(A) of A (in B) to be the minimum value of δ(A') for all finite subsets A' of B which contain A.

We define the d-closure of A in B to be:

[formula]

where, as usual, Ac is shorthand for [formula].

These notions can be relativized. If A,C  ⊆  B∈C0(L) define δ(A / C) to be [formula] and [formula]: the (pre)dimension over C. In all of this notation, we will suppress the subscript for the ambient structure B if it is clear from the context.

We can coherently extend the definition of d-closure to infinite subsets A of B by saying that the d-closure of A is the union of the d-closures of finite subsets of A. It can be shown that (B,clB) is a pregeometry and the dimension function (as cardinality of a basis) equals dB on finite subsets of B. We use the notation PG(B) instead of (B,clB), and denote by G(B) the associated (combinatorial) geometry: so the elements of G(B) are the sets [formula] for [formula] and the closure on G(B) is that induced by clB. Note that if A  ≤  B∈0(L) then for X  ⊆  A we have dA(X)  =  dB(X). Thus G can be regarded as a functor from (0(L),  ≤  ) to the category of geometries (with embeddings of geometries as morphisms).

If Y  ⊆  B∈0(L) then the localization of PG(B) over Y is the pregeometry with closure operation [formula]. The corresponding geometry is denoted by GY(B). Note that the dimension function here is given by the relative dimension dB(. / Y).

It will be convenient to fix a first order language for the class of pregeometries. A reasonable choice for this is the language LPI = {In:n  ≥  1} where each In is an n-ary relational symbol. A pregeometry (P,cl) will be seen as a structure in this language by taking IPn to be the set of independent n-tuples in P. Notice that we can recover a pregeometry just by knowing its finite independent sets. Note also that the isomorphism type of a pregeometry is determined by the isomorphism type of its associated geometry and the size of the equivalence classes of interdependence. In the case where these are all countably infinite, it therefore makes no difference whether we consider the geometry or the pregeometry.

Self-sufficient amalgamation classes

If B1,B2∈0(L) have a common substructure A then the free amalgam E of B1 and B2 over A consists of the disjoint union of B1 and B2 over A and [formula] for each i∈I. It is well known that if A  ≤  B1 then B2  ≤  E, so E∈0(L), and (C0,  ≤  ) is an amalgamation class. It can also be shown that if A is d-closed in B1 then B2 is d-closed in E.

Suppose Y  ≤  Z∈C0(L) and Y  ≠  Z. Following [\cite=EH], we say that this is an algebraic extension if δ(Y)  =  δ(Z). It is a simply algebraic extension if also δ(Z')  >  δ(Y) whenever Y  ⊂  Z'  ⊂  Z. It is a minimally simply algebraic (msa) extension if additionally [formula] is not simply algebraic whenever Y'  ⊂  Y.

It can be shown that for each n  ≥  0 there are arbitrarily large msa extensions Y  ≤  Z in C0(L) with δ(Y)  =  n (this make use of the fact that at least one of the relations Ri has arity at least 3, which is certainly covered by our assumptions on L).

The following is trivial, but crucial for us:

Suppose Y  ≤  Z is a msa extension. Then for every y∈Y there is some [formula] and [formula] such that y,z∈w. Moreover, if [formula] is not a singleton and [formula], then there are at least two elements of [formula] which contain z.

Suppose this does not hold for some y∈Y. Let [formula]. Then for every [formula] we have [formula]. So [formula] is simply algebraic: contradiction. Similarly, for the 'moreover' part, if z is in at most one relation in [formula], then [formula], which contradicts the simple algebraicity.

We let μ be a function from the set of isomorphism types of minimally simply algebraic extensions in C0(L) to the non-negative integers. The subclass Cμ(L) consists of structures in C0(L) which, for each msa Y  ≤  Z in C0(L), omit the atomic type consisting of μ(Y,Z) + 1 disjoint copies of Z over Y.

We will work with μ where the following holds:

Note that (ii) here follows from (i) (cf. the proof of Lemma 4 in [\cite=EH]), and by Section 2 of [\cite=EH], (i) holds if μ(Y,Z)  ≥  δ(Y) for all msa Y  ≤  Z in C0(L).

Generic structures and their geometries

Suppose A is a subclass of C0(L) such that (A,  ≤  ) is an amalgamation class: meaning that if B∈A and A  ≤  B then A∈A, and if A  ≤  B1,B2∈A then there is C∈A and embeddings fi:Bi  →  C with fi(Bi)  ≤  C and f1|A  =  f2|A. Then there is a countable structure M∈0(L) satisfying the following conditions:

M is the union of a chain [formula] of structures in A.

(extension property) If A  ≤  M and A  ≤  B∈A then there exists an embedding g:B  →  M such that g(B)  ≤  M and g(a)  =  a for all a∈A.

We refer to M as the generic structure of the amalgamation class (A,  ≤  ): it is determined up to isomorphism by the properties G1 and G2 (and G1 is automatic for countable structures in 0(L)). Of course, Hrushovski's strongly minimal sets are the generic structures Mμ(L) for the amalgamation classes (Cμ(L),  ≤  ). We will compare the geometries of these with that of the generic structure M0(L) for the amalgamation class (C0(L),  ≤  ).

Suppose (A,  ≤  ) and (A',  ≤  ) are amalgamation classes, as above. We refer to the following as the Isomorphism Extension Property, and denote it by [formula].

Suppose A∈A, A'∈A' and f:G(A)  →  G(A') is an isomorphism of geometries, and A  ≤  B∈A. Then there is B'∈A' with A'  ≤  B' and an isomorphism f':G(B)  →  G(B') which extends f.

Suppose (A,  ≤  ) and (A',  ≤  ) are amalgamation classes with generic structures M, M' respectively. Suppose that both extension properties [formula] and [formula] hold. Then the geometries G(M) and G(M') are isomorphic.

We have already remarked that if A  ≤  M, then the dimension of a subset of A is the same whether computed in A or in M. Thus G(A) is naturally a substructure of G(M). We claim that the set S of geometry-isomorphisms

[formula]

where A  ≤  M,A'  ≤  M' are finite is a back-and-forth system between G(M) and G(M'). Indeed (for the 'forth'), given such an f:G(A)  →  G(A') and A  ≤  B  ≤  M, there is A'  ≤  B'∈A' and an isomorphism f':G(B)  →  G(B') extending f, by our assumption [formula]. The extension property G2 in M' means that we can take B'  ≤  M', as required. Similarly we obtain the 'back' part from [formula] and G2 in M. It follows that G(M) and G(M') are isomorphic.

We can adapt this slightly to give a criterion for local isomorphism of G(M) and G(M'). This is really just about adding parameters to the language, but we make it explicit. Suppose X∈A and X'∈A' are fixed finite structures with X  ≤  M and X'  ≤  M'. We write [formula] for the statement:

Suppose X  ≤  A∈A, X'  ≤  A'∈A' and f:GX(A)  →  GX'(A') is an isomorphism of geometries, and A  ≤  B∈A. Then there is B'∈A' with A'  ≤  B' and an isomorphism f':GX(B)  →  GX'(B') which extends f.

Here, recall that GX(A) is the localization of G(A) over X, as defined in Section 2.1. It follows as in Lemma [\ref=isolemma] that if [formula] and [formula] hold, then GX(M) and GX'(M') are isomorphic.

Isomorphism of the strongly minimal set geometries

Throughout, (C0(L),  ≤  ) and (Cμ(L),  ≤  ) are the amalgamation classes from the previous section. Note that (C0(L),  ≤  ) is an amalgamation class and we are assuming that the amalgamation lemma [\ref=aalemma] holds for Cμ(L). We denote the generic structures by M0(L) and Mμ(L) respectively: so the latter is Hrushovski's strongly minimal set D(L,μ). The geometries are denoted by G(M0(L)) and G(Mμ(L)). We have already remarked that there are arbitrarily large msa extensions [formula] in C0(L), so if [formula] for infinitely many of these, then [formula] is infinite as it contains a copy of each such Z. Similarly, there are infinitely many msa extensions Y  ≤  Z∈C0(L) with δ(Y)  =  1, so if μ(Y,Z)  >  0 for all of these, and X  ≤  Mμ(L) is a singleton, then clMμ(L)(X) is infinite. Our main result is:

Suppose [\ref=aalemma] holds and μ(Y,Z)  ≥  2 for all msa Y  ≤  Z∈C0(L) with δ(Y)  ≥  2 and μ(Y,Z)  ≥  1 when δ(Y)  =  1. Suppose that X  ≤  Mμ(L) is finite and clMμ(L)(X) is infinite. Then GX(Mμ(L)) and G(M0(L)) are isomorphic geometries. In particular, G(Mμ(L)) and G(M0(L)) are locally isomorphic.

Note that X can be taken as [formula] or a singleton, by the remarks preceding the theorem. We need to verify that the isomorphism extension property of Lemma [\ref=isolemma] and Remarks [\ref=isorem] holds in both directions. The main part will be to show that [formula]. In fact, because of the symmetry of the argument, it will be convenient to take an arbitrary finite W  ≤  M0(L) and show that [formula].

So suppose we are given W  ≤  A  ≤  B∈C0(L) and X  ≤  A'∈Cμ(L) with an isomorphism f:GW(A)  →  GX(A'). We want to find B'∈Cμ(L) with A'  ≤  B' and an isomorphism f':GW(B)  →  GX(B') extending f. The main point will be to ensure that each point of [formula] is involved in only a small number of relations, and this gives us control over the msa extensions in B'.

Let A0  =  clA(W) and let [formula] be the d-dependence classes (over W) on [formula]: the latter are the points of GW(A). Similarly let B0  =  clB(W) and [formula] the d-dependence classes (over W) on [formula], with Ai  ⊆  Bi for [formula]. List the relations on B which are not contained in A or some [formula] as [formula]. So these are finite sets. Let A0'  =  clA'(X) and [formula] be the classes of d-dependence (over X) on [formula], labelled so that f(Ai)  =  Ai'. We construct [formula] with Ai'  ⊆  Bi' for [formula], and [formula] in the steps below.

Terminology: If u,v∈E∈C0(L), say that u,v are adjacent in E if there exists [formula] such that u,v∈w.

Step 1: Construction of [formula]. Take A0'  ≤  V∈Cμ(L) with δ(V)  =  δ(X) and [formula] sufficiently large. For example, by our assumption on X, Cμ(L) contains arbitrarily large finite algebraic extensions of X, so we can take V∈Cμ(L) to be an amalgamation of A0' and one of these over X. Let A'' be the free amalgam of A' and V over A0' and let B0' be the copy of V inside this. As A0' is d-closed in A' and A0'  ≤  V it follows from [\ref=aalemma] that A''∈Cμ(L), B0' is d-closed in A'' and A'  ≤  A''. Note that δ(A'')  =  δ(A').

Step 2: Construction of [formula]. We do this so that B0' is d-closed in [formula] and [formula]. (As [formula], it then follows that [formula] when 1  ≤  i  ≤  r.) Let m be sufficiently large. Choose some Ri: for example R1 of arity n  ≥  3.

Case 1: Suppose i  ≤  r. Pick bi0∈Ai' and let [formula] be disjoint (n - 2)-subsets of [formula] (we adjust the choice of V in step 1 to accommodate this). Let [formula] and include as new R1-relations on [formula] the n-sets [formula] for 1  ≤  j  ≤  m. We need to show that this has the required properties.

First, note that [formula], so [formula].

Suppose Y  ≤  Z is a msa extension in [formula] not contained in [formula]. So [formula]. If [formula] then [formula] is algebraic, so [formula] and [formula] As the elements of sij are non-adjacent to bi0 in [formula], it follows that there is only one copy of Z over Y in [formula]. If bij∈Y, then by Lemma [\ref=21] [formula]. But then there is at most one copy of Z over Y in [formula]. Note that [formula]. So in both cases we meet the requirements for [formula].

Now note that [formula] is the free amalgam over [formula] of the structures [formula] (for [formula]). Each [formula] is an algebraic extension and the only msa extension in this with base in [formula] and which is not contained in [formula] is [formula]. So the amalgamation lemma [\ref=aalemma] implies that [formula]. It is clear that [formula] so [formula].

Finally, note that as B0' is d-closed in [formula] and [formula], the d-closure of B0' in [formula] does not contain bi0. It then follows easily that B0' is d-closed in [formula].

Case 2: i  >  r. As in Case 1, let [formula] be (n - 2)-subsets of [formula] with no relations on them. Let [formula] and include as new R1-relations on [formula] the n-sets [formula] for 1  ≤  j  ≤  m - 1. In this version of the construction we take the sij to be si, independent of j.

It is clear that [formula] and if [formula] then [formula]. So [formula] and therefore [formula], and B0' is d-closed in [formula]. It remains to show that [formula], so suppose Y  ≤  Z1 is a msa extension in [formula]. If δ(Y)  =  0 then Z1  ⊆  B0' and the same is true of any copy of Z1 over Y. Similarly, if Y  ⊆  B0' then all copies of Z1 over Y are contained in B0' as this is d-closed in [formula]. So we can assume that δ(Y)  ≥  1 and bij∈Y for some j. By Lemma [\ref=21], we can assume that one of the relations [formula] is a subset of Z1.

If [formula] is a singleton then there is at most one other copy Z2 of Z1 over Y, and in this case [formula]. Note that δ(Y)  ≥  2 here, so μ(Y,Z1)  ≥  2, by hypothesis.

Now suppose that [formula] has at least two elements. It will suffice to prove that there is no other copy Z2 of Z1 over Y in [formula], so suppose there is such a Z2. Take j maximal such that [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=21], bij is in at least two relations in [formula]; but bij is only in two relations in [formula] and one of these also involves bi(j + 1), so this is in [formula]. This contradicts the choice of j.

Step 3: Other relations on B'. The relations on B' not contained in A' or some [formula] are [formula]. We can choose these to be subsets of [formula] with [formula] if i  ≠  j, and [formula] iff [formula] (for j  ≥  1). Note that this is possible if m is sufficiently large. We make ρi' of the same type as ρi (that is, in the same Rj).

This completes the construction of B'. We now make a series of claims about it.

Claim 1: Let [formula], and [formula], [formula]. Then [formula] is d-closed in A iff [formula] is d-closed in A', and in this case we have δ(Y / B0)  =  δ(Y' / B0').

Let U0  =  {i∈U:i  ≤  r} and U1  =  {i∈U:i  >  r}. Then [formula] and [formula]. Because f is an isomorphism of geometries, one of these is d-closed (in A or A') iff the other is (remembering that a subset of a geometry is d-closed iff any set properly containing it has bigger dimension). So suppose this is the case. We compute that:

[formula]

where J  =  {j:ρj'  ⊆  Y'}. This follows from the fact that Y' consists of |U0| sets of δ-value 0 over [formula] and |U1| sets of δ-value 1 over [formula], and an extra |J| relations ρ'j between them. Moreover

[formula]

using, for example, the construction of A'' as a free amalgam in step 1. Thus we have

[formula]

Now, by construction (step 3) we have ρj  ⊆  Y iff ρ'j  ⊆  Y'. So an identical calculation shows that

[formula]

(This uses the fact that A,B0 are freely amalgamated over A0, which follows from the definitions of A0, B0 and the assumption that A  ≤  B.) By the isomorphism f, we have [formula]. If [formula], [formula] are d-closed (in A', A respectively) then [formula] and [formula]. So in this case [formula], as d(W)  =  δ(A0) and d(X)  =  δ(A0'). Thus we have δ(Y / B0)  =  δ(Y' / B0'), as required. [formula]

Claim 2: B'∈C0(L), B0' and [formula] are d-closed in B' and A''  ≤  B'. The map f':GW(B)  →  GX(B') given by f'(Bi)  =  Bi' is an isomorphism of geometries which extends f.

First, note that (by construction step 2) if B0'  ⊆  C  ⊆  B' and [formula], then δ(C)  ≥  δ(Y'). If A''  ⊆  C then by Claim 1, δ(Y' / B0')  =  δ(Y / B0), where [formula]. This contains A, so as A  ≤  B we have δ(Y)  ≥  δ(A). By the isomorphism, δ(A / A0)  =  δ(A' / A0')  =  δ(A'' / B0') (by step 1). Thus δ(C / B0')  ≥  δ(Y' / B0')  =  δ(Y / B0)  ≥  δ(A / A0)  =  δ(A'' / B0') (using that δ(A0)  =  δ(B0)). This shows A''  ≤  B' and therefore (as [formula]) we also have [formula].

Now suppose Y'  ≥  X is d-closed in B'. Then B0'  ⊆  Y' and as above, Y' is of the form [formula] for some U. Moreover [formula] is d-closed in A' and so we can apply Claim 1. It follows from this that B0' is d-closed in B' and the d-closed sets of dimension 1 over B0' are the [formula], by using the fact that the corresponding statements hold in B.

It remains to show that f' is an isomorphism of geometries. Let Y, Y' be as in Claim 1. We need to show that Y is d-closed in B iff Y' is d-closed in B'. So suppose Y is d-closed in B. Then [formula] is d-closed in A and so we can apply Claim 1 to get that δ(Y / B0)  =  δ(Y' / B0'). Suppose for a contradiction that Y' is not d-closed in B'. Let Z' be its d-closure in B'. So [formula] for some Q with [formula] and δ(Z')  ≤  δ(Y'). Let [formula]. So Y  ⊂  Z. Because Z' is d-closed in B' and therefore [formula] is d-closed in A', we can apply Claim 1 to get that δ(Z / B0)  =  δ(Z' / B0'). So we have

[formula]

and this contradicts the fact that Y is d-closed and Y  ⊂  Z. Thus Y' is d-closed in B'. The argument for the converse implication is the same.[formula]

Claim 3: B'∈Cμ(L).

Suppose that Y  ≤  Z is a minimally simply algebraic extension in B'. First suppose δ(Y)  =  δ(Z)  ≤  1. Then d(Y)  ≤  1, so [formula] for some i and as [formula] is d-closed in B', any copies of Z over Y in B' are contained in [formula]. So there are at most μ(Y,Z) of these as [formula].

Now suppose that δ(Y)  ≥  2 and suppose for a contradiction that Zi (for [formula]) are disjoint copies in B' of Z over Y  ⊆  B' (meaning that the sets [formula] are disjoint, of course).

If y∈Y then y is in some relation in [formula] (for some k∈I) by Lemma [\ref=21]. Thus y is in at least three relations in RB'k (one in each [formula]). By inspection of the construction one therefore sees that y∈A'' or y  =  bij for some i  >  r. In the latter case, two of the (at most) three relations in B' which involve bij are [formula] and [formula]. So we can assume that the first is a subset of Z1 (and not a subset of Y) and the second is a subset of Z2. But this implies that si  ⊆  Y. However, there is no other relation which contains [formula]: contradicting the fact that Z3 is a copy of Z1 over Y.

Thus Y  ⊆  A''. As A''∈Cμ(L) not all of the Zi are subsets of A'', so we can assume that [formula]. As A''  ≤  B' we have [formula] so (by the simplicity of the extension) [formula].

Note that Z1 is in the d-closure of Y so we cannot have Y  ⊆  B0'. Let [formula]. This is adjacent in Z1 to some [formula]. So [formula] is adjacent in B' to [formula]. Inspection of the construction shows that y  =  bi0 (for some i  ≤  r) and z  =  bij. Then the adjacency of y and z in Z1 forces sij  ⊆  Z1, and so sij  ⊆  Y (as [formula]). But then [formula] is a simply algebraic extension in Z1. As Y  ≤  Z1 is a minimally simply algebraic extension, this implies [formula] and [formula]. However, there is no other relation in B' which contains this Y (by construction), so we have a contradiction. [formula]

Claims 2 and 3 finish the proof of the isomorphism extension property [formula].

For the other direction, we can use the same construction (it is a special case of the the above as Cμ(L)  ⊆  C0(L)). Of course, in this case we do not need Claim 3.

Further isomorphisms

Localization of non-isomorphic geometries

In this subsection the language L has just a single 3-ary relation R. We often suppress L in the notation.

In 5.2 of [\cite=EH] Hrushovski varies his strongly minimal set construction to produce examples where the model-theoretic structure of the strongly minimal set can be read off from the geometry: lines of the geometry have three points, and colinear points correspond to instances of the ternary relation. He thereby produces continuum-many non-isomorphic geometries of (countable, saturated) strongly minimal structures, but asks whether these examples are locally isomorphic. We show that this is the case: in fact, localizing any of them over a 3-dimensional set gives a geometry isomorphic to G(M0(L)), the geometry of the generic structure for (C0(L),  ≤  ).

In 5.2 of [\cite=EH], Hrushovski considers

[formula]

The class (K0,  ≤  ) is an amalgamation class: one shows that if A  ≤  B1,B2∈K0 and the free amalgam of B1 and B2 over A is not in K0, then there exist a,a'∈A and [formula] with R(a,a',bi) holding in Bi (for i = 1,2).

More generally, given a function μ as before, we can consider [formula] and for appropriate μ, the class (Kμ,  ≤  ) will satisfy Assumption [\ref=aalemma]. In fact, we only need to define μ(Y,Z) for δ(Y)  ≥  3. For suppose Y  ≤  Z is a minimally simply algebraic extension in K0 and δ(Y)  =  δ(Z)  ≤  2. Then Z has at most 3 elements: otherwise there is a subset W  ⊆  Z of size 3 with [formula], and then W is not self-sufficient in Z, contradicting the definition of K0. It follows that the value of μ(Y,Z) is irrelevant for such Y  ≤  Z: the multiplicity is already controlled by the definition of K0.

So we shall assume:

Again, (ii) follows from (i) here and the condition μ(Y,Z)  ≥  δ(Y) (for δ(Y)  ≥  3) guarantees that (i) holds.

Denote the generic structure of (Kμ,  ≤  ) by Nμ. The d-closure of two points in Nμ has size 3 (as above), so certainly G(Nμ) and G(M0(L)) are non-isomorphic. In fact, we can recover the relation R from the geometry G(Nμ) as the 3-sets with dimension 2. Thus different μ give different geometries. It can be shown that there are infinitely many msa extensions Y  ≤  Z∈K0 with δ(Y)  =  3, so if μ(Y,Z)  ≥  1 for infinitely many of these, then clNμ(X) is infinite whenever X  ≤  Nμ consists of 3 independent points.

We show:

Suppose μ(Y,Z)  ≥  3 for all msa Y  ≤  Z in K0 with δ(Y)  ≥  3 and Assumption [\ref=HAmalgLemma] holds. Let X  ≤  Nμ and d(X)  =  3. Then the localization GX(Nμ) is isomorphic to G(M0(L)).

We may assume that X consists of 3 points (and no relations). By the remarks preceding the theorem, X has arbitrarily large finite algebraic extensions in Kμ. We show that the isomorphism extension property [formula] holds.

Suppose we are given A  ≤  B∈C0(L) and X  ≤  A'∈Kμ and an isomorphism f:G(A)  →  GX(A'). We want to find B'∈Kμ with A'  ≤  B' and an isomorphism f':G(B)  →  GX(B') extending f. This is very similar to the the construction of B' in the proof of Theorem [\ref=main] and we will only indicate what needs to be modified and provide extra argument as required.

Let [formula] and let [formula] be the d-dependence classes on [formula]: the latter are the points of G(A). Similarly let [formula] and [formula] the d-dependence classes on [formula], with Ai  ⊆  Bi for [formula]. List the relations on B which are not contained in A or some [formula] as [formula]. So these are 3-sets and note that each of them intersects three different Bi. Let A0'  =  clA'(X) and [formula] be the classes of d-dependence over X on [formula], labelled so that f(Ai)  =  Ai'. We construct [formula] with Ai'  ⊆  Bi' for [formula], and [formula] in the following way.

Step 1: Construction of [formula]. This is as before, but we need to take V∈Kμ: we can do this because algebraic extensions of X can be arbitrarily large.

Step 2: Construction of [formula]. The construction is as in Theorem [\ref=main] for i  ≤  r. In the case i  >  r we vary the construction by taking the sij to be distinct. The proofs that B0' is d-closed in [formula] are as before; as are the arguments which show that if Y  ≤  Z is a msa extension in K0 with δ(Y)  ≥  3 then there are at most μ(Y,Z) copies of Z over Y in [formula]. So it remains to show that [formula].

If i  ≤  r, then using the amalgmation lemma [\ref=HAmalgLemma] as in Step 2, Case 1 of Theorem [\ref=main], it will suffice to show that [formula]. This is the free amalgam of {sij,bi0,bij} and [formula] over {sij,bi0}. So we can apply [\ref=HAmalgLemma] (because {sij,bi0} is in no relation in [formula]).

Now suppose i  >  r. We analyse the possibilities for δ(Y) when [formula], [formula] and |Y|  >  1. As [formula] is d-closed in Y we have [formula]. If [formula] then by the construction, δ(Y)  =  |Y|. If [formula] is a singleton then Y has at most one relation (because the sij are distinct), so δ(Y)  >  1 and δ(Y)  ≥  |Y| - 1. In the remaining case, [formula] (as B0'∈K0), so δ(Y)  ≥  3. Thus, Y consists of 2 points, or is 3 points in a relation, or has δ(Y)  ≥  3. It follows that [formula].

Step 3: Other relations on B'. As before.

Claim 1: Let [formula], and [formula], [formula]. Then [formula] is d-closed in A iff [formula] is d-closed in A', and in this case we have δ(Y)  =  δ(Y' / B0').

As before.

Claim 2: B'∈C0(L), B0' and [formula] are d-closed in B' and A''  ≤  B'. The map f':G(B)  →  GX(B') given by f'(Bi)  =  Bi' is an isomorphism of geometries which extends f.

As before, using Claim 1.

Claim 3: If i  ≠  j then [formula] and [formula].

By construction [formula] is the free amalgam of [formula] and [formula] over B0', and B0' is d-closed in each. So the first statement follows from the assumed amalgamation lemma [\ref=HAmalgLemma]. We have [formula]. Moreover, as [formula] is d-closed in B' (Claim 2), if [formula] then δ(Z / B0')  ≥  2. This gives the second statement.[formula]

Claim 4: B'∈K0.

We need to show that if D  ⊆  B' has size at most 3 then D  ≤  B'. If |D|  ≤  2 then [formula] for some i,j and it follows from Claim 3 that [formula]. So suppose D has size 3 and D  ⊆  C with δ(C)  <  δ(D). We must have δ(C)  =  2 (as any two points of D are self-sufficient in C and have δ-value 2). As A''∈K0 there is an i such that [formula]. Note that C is not contained in [formula] (because this is in Kμ), so as B0' is d-closed in [formula] and the latter is d-closed in B', we have

[formula]

Thus [formula], so [formula].

It then follows from Step 2 of the construction that there is no adjacency in C between points of [formula] and points of [formula]. Let q  =  |{j:ρj'  ⊆  C}|. Then (using A''  ≤  B'; so [formula])

[formula]

as the ρj' are disjoint. If q  =  0 then C is [formula] together with some isolated points, and this is in Kμ (so not possible in this situation). If q  =  1 then C consists of 3 points in a single relation and this has no subset of the form required for D. [formula]

Claim 5: B'∈Kμ We already know that B'∈K0, so we need to show that B'∈Cμ(L), at least as far as msa extensions Y  ≤  Z with δ(Y)  ≥  3 are concerned. So suppose [formula] are disjoint copies of Z over Y in B'. Then each element y∈Y is in at least 4 relations (using [\ref=21], as before), so by construction, y∈A''. Thus Y  ⊆  A'' and the rest of the proof is just as in Claim 3 of Theorem [\ref=main]. [formula]

Claims 2 and 5 finish the proof of one direction of the isomorphism extension property. The direction [formula] follows from the property [formula] proved in Theorem [\ref=main].

Note that K0 can be considered as Kμ where μ(Y,Z) is formally given the value ∞   for all msa Y  ≤  Z∈K0. Thus the above argument also shows that the geometry of N0, the generic for (K0,  ≤  ), is locally isomorphic to G(M0(L)).

Another variation is given in 5.1 of [\cite=EH]. Let k  ≥  2 and consider the language L with a single (k + 1)-ary relation symbol R. Let

[formula]

So if C  ⊆  A∈C0'(L) and |C|  ≤  k then C  ≤  A. Hrushovski observes that (C0'(L),  ≤  ) is a free amalgamation class and that the assumed amalgamation lemma [\ref=aalemma] holds for (Cμ',  ≤  ), for suitable μ  ≥  2. The generic structures here are strongly minimal and any k points are independent. So the geometries are again different from that of M0(L). However, they are again locally isomorphic. To see this we proceed as in Theorem [\ref=surprise], but take X to be a set of size k. The construction and proof are essentially the same as before, except for in Claim 4 where to show that B'∈C0'(L) we modify the argument as follows.

Suppose C  ⊆  B' has δ(C)  <  k and |C|  ≥  k + 1. Then for some i we have:

[formula]

So [formula] and therefore [formula]. Then by construction there is no adjacency in C between points of [formula] and points of [formula]. So (with q as before):

[formula]

Thus q  =  0 and we have a contradiction.

Changing the language and predimension

Recall that the language L consists of relation symbols {Ri:i∈I} with Ri of arity ni (and only finitely many symbols of each arity). Suppose that L0  =  {Ri:i∈I0} is a sublanguage with the property that for every i∈I there is j∈I0 such that ni  ≤  nj. For example, if I is finite we can take L0 to consist of a relation symbol of maximal arity in L. The following is essentially Theorem 3.1 of [\cite=MFDE1], but working with sets rather than tuples: we omit most of the details of the proof.

The geometries G(M0(L)) and G(M0(L0)) are isomorphic.

We can use the construction in Theorem [\ref=main] to show that [formula] holds. In step 3 of the construction, if ρi is a k-set then we take ρi' to be a k'-set with k'  ≥  k: the condition on L0 allows us to do this. Claims 1 and 2 of Theorem [\ref=main] then go through exactly as previously. The direction [formula] follows as in Theorem [\ref=main].

Theorem 3.1 of [\cite=MFDE1] works with a predimension of the form:

[formula]

where the αi are natural numbers. We can adapt the argument here to deal with such predimensions. For example, suppose I is finite and R1 is of maximal arity and α1  =  1. Let L0 consist of R1. Then, as in Theorem 3.1 of [\cite=MFDE1], G(M0(L)) is isomorphic to G(M0(L0)). To show that [formula] (where Cα0(L) is defined using the predimension δα) we perform the same construction except that in step 3, if ρj is of type Ri then we add αi corresponding ρj' (but still disjoint etc).

Sets versus tuples

We have chosen to work with structures A where the relations RAi are sets of ni-sets. As was done in [\cite=MFDE1] we could also have worked more generally with structures A where the RAi are sets of ni-tuples and the predimension is still given by [formula]. Let 0(L) denote the class of these finite structures with [formula].

The geometries of the generic structures of the amalgamation classes (C0,  ≤  ) and (0(L),  ≤  ) are isomorphic.

This is the usual sort of proof using the construction. For example, to show [formula] we replace an ni-tuple ρj (in [formula]) by an ni-set, using the new d-dependent points to eliminate repetitions of points in the tuple or different enumerations of the same set.
