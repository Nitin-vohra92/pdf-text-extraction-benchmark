Verhulst-Lotka-Volterra (VLV) model of ideological struggles

Introduction

Not further elaborating here on riots, revolutions, or wars, it is well known that socio-economic systems, or civilisations, survive because of the resolution of conflicts. These are indeed sources of population decimation, and of various critical events, called "humanitarian crises".

Opinion conflicts, so numerous in economic and social systems, are thus connected to competition between so called degrees of freedom: religions [\cite=petr07e] [\cite=petr07a], languages [\cite=abrams], businesses [\cite=caram], and to the problem of growth / extinction of populations [\cite=pec08], per se. Whence the need for a basic theoretical approach and some modelling in order to focus any data gathering toward useful input in further work.

In this spirit, an analytical model for ideological struggles in e.g. economy and social systems is here below formulated. The underlying set of agents is supposed to be a closed and finite one, like those usually existing in a so called country, but we emphasise letting the population size be varying in time for being more realistic. An appropriate equation for doing so seems that of Verhulst [\cite=Verhulst], extending the classical equation of exponential growth [\cite=Euler] [\cite=Malthus]. The dynamics of the struggle is next to be modelled; here below it is described through model equations as those of Lotka and Volterra [\cite=Lotka] [\cite=Volterra], Thus the analytical model of competition between opinions is formulated through a combined set of well known equations, each set based on one variable, i.e. for each ideology population (or rather concentration).

For being imaginative, notice that models other than that of Volterra and Lotka can be used as starting points. For example, Montroll [\cite=M6] has suggested a model in which the logarithms of populations obey linear equations. This model seems to be connected with Gompertz's law of population growth [\cite=Gompertzlaw] in the same way that the Volterra-Lotka model is connected with Verhulst's (so called logistic) law. Moreover discrete simulation approaches can be envisaged: see an interesting but brief review on prey-predator models on lattices by Pekalski in [\cite=pekComSim2004]

Most importantly: several "ideologies" usually compete to increase their number of adepts. Members or "followers" can be either converted from one ideology to another or become followers of one ideology though being previously ideologically-free. Reverse processes can be also allowed, with a so called change of mind.

Two kinds of influences can be used for conversion: (i) conversion by means of mass communication tools, thus under some external field influence, or (ii) conversion by means of direct interactions between agents. These different processes should remind one of the various terms in Hamiltonian mechanics based on the level of interactions between entities., i.e. the number of clusters to be considered, as in a renormalisation group approach. Moreover those terms are the basic ones in a Lotka-Volterra equation, one is linear in the population concentration, the other based on the product of the population concentrations.

As interesting results, it is briefly mentioned that change(s) in environmental conditions can prevent the extinction of populations of followers of some ideology. Instead different kinds of resurrection effects can occur, so called phoenix effects. Moreover when a new ideology appears in the system, since some tension arises, stressing the population steady state(s), it is proposed to measure the ideology tensions through an appropriately defined scale index. The latter evolution would be a convenient monitoring measure for calibrating the model parameters.

Mathematical formulation of the model

Consider N agents, divided into n + 1 different specific ideologies, such that the number of members in the corresponding populations are [formula], and also N0 agents who are not followers of any ideology at a given time t, or i.e. [formula] Moreover define C(t,N,Nν,pμ) as the so called carrying capacity; let pμ stand for [formula] parameters describing the environment and Nν for [formula].

The overall population is supposed to evolve according to

[formula]

where the growth process is monitored [\cite=wilke] through the overall population growth rate [formula].

For every ideology/population i one should account for (1) deaths, (2) unitary conversion, and (3) binary conversion:

Death implies a term riNi, with ri = ri(t,N,Nν,pμ,C)  ≤  0.

Unitary conversion is made only through the information environment of the population. The number of people converted from ideology j to ideology i is assumed to be proportional to the number Nj. An fij = fij(t,N,Nν,pμ,C) coefficient characterises the intensity with which this conversion occurs; fii = 0. The corresponding modelling term is fijNj

Binary conversion occurs when there is conversion to the i-th ideology because of direct interaction between members of the j-th and k-th ideology. It is assumed that the intensity of the interpersonal contacts is proportional to the numbers Nj and Nk. The coefficient characterising the intensity of the binary conversion is bijk = bijk(t,N,Nν,pμ,C); of course biii = 0. The corresponding modelling term is bijkNjNk.

For space saving, the final set of equations is not further written, but the case of constant values of the parameters is discussed in the next section. Notice that arbitrary values are not allowed for the coefficients of the model; e.g. they must have values such that N, N0, [formula], Nn be positive.

Summary of Results

Analytical and simulation studies have been performed for constant values of the parameters, i.e. the struggling population i evolution is governed by

[formula]

bearing Eq.([\ref=N]) as a constraint on the population competition [\cite=dv01a] [\cite=dv06]. Notice also that terms like fi0Ni0, or bii0NiN0 or bi00N20, etc. are not excluded

For the case of one ideology, the simple version of the general model describes the evolution to an equilibrium state in which the population consists of some amount of followers of the ideology and persons indifferent to the ideology. The case of one ideology in presence of a background population reaches an asymptotic stable state. An interesting situation occurs when [formula] changes sign with t. It can be observed that the number of followers of the ideology can increase despite the fact that r1 < 0. The reason for this effect is the N0 increase, occurring because of the fast growth of the country population. When N0 is small the term containing r1 dominates and N1 decreases. But in the course of time N0 increases. Then the conversion begins to dominate over dissatisfaction and the number of followers of the ideology increases. Such a growth is called an inertial growth.

When two ideologies compete in presence of the ideology - free population, it can be observed that an ideology population shrinks. At the fixed point, e.g.

[formula]

Moreover, it can be observed that change(s) in environmental conditions, through the set of parameteres pμ, explicitly or implicitly appearing in C, ri, fij, and bijk, can prevent the extinction of populations of followers of some ideology. Different kinds of resurrection (so called phoenix) effects can occur, depending on the most relevant term, in particular fij or bijk.

It is suggested that a measure of the tension between populations, with different opinions, can be through the index

[formula]

where N(k)i(t) is the population of the followers of the i-th ideology when the k-th ideology is present.

The case of three and four ideologies has been numerically investigated elsewhere [\cite=VDA10], also generalising the notion of tension index for the case of an arbitrary number of ideologies in the country [\cite=VDA10]. Steady states, cycles or chaotic regimes can be obtained.

Concluding remarks

Notice that the model applies to cases in which countries have a variable total population which evolves according to the generalised Verhulst model. Moreover it should be emphasised that a conversion can be outside the competing ideologies of interacting agents: see Eq.([\ref=mod_syst3]) last term.

In contrast to simulation model, avoiding stochastic noise as an input, the above analytical model allows for resurrection ("phoenix") effects. The introduction of an ideology leads to some tension between the previously present ideologies, as the numbers of followers drop. Such tensions can be quantified by a set of indices. Although the number of parameters seems considerable, as in many realistic population evolution studies, the set of parameters appears to be realistic enough to be calibrated in specific situations, in particular by monitoring such tension indices.
