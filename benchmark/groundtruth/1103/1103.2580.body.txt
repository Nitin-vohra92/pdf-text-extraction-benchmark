Introduction

Let us consider the following well known mean of order t [\cite=beb]:

[formula]

for all a,b,t∈R,a,b  >  0.

In particular, we have

[formula]

The means, H(a,b), G(a,b), A(a,b) and S(a,b) are known in the literature as harmonic, geometric, arithmetic and root-square means respectively. For simplicity we can call the measure, N1(a,b) as square-root mean. It is well know that [\cite=beb] the mean of order t given in ([\ref=eq1]) is monotonically increasing in t, then we can write

[formula]

Dragomir and Pearce [\cite=drp] proved the following inequality:

[formula]

for all a,b  >  0, a  ≠  b, r∈(0,1). In particular take [formula] in ([\ref=eq1]), we get

[formula]

After necessary calculations in ([\ref=eq3]), we get

[formula]

On the other side we can easily check that

[formula]

The expressions ([\ref=eq3]), ([\ref=eq4]) and ([\ref=eq5]) lead us to the following inequality:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus we have three new means, where N1(a,b) appears as a natural way. The N2(a,b) can be seen in Taneja [\cite=tan2], [\cite=tan3] and the mean N3(a,b) can be seen in Zhang and Wu [\cite=zhw]. Some more properties of the means given in ([\ref=eq6]) are studied by [\cite=szd], [\cite=sjz]. A survey on these inequalities can be seen in [\cite=tan5].

Based on the inequalities ([\ref=eq6]), the author [\cite=tan3]-[\cite=tan4] proved the following results

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The above inequalities are based on the following two lemmas [\cite=tan2]:

Let f:I  ⊂  R+  →  R be a convex and differentiable function satisfying [formula]. Consider a function

[formula]

then the function φf(a,b) is convex in R2+, and satisfies the following inequality:

[formula]

Let f1,f2:I  ⊂  R+  →  R be two convex functions satisfying the assumptions:

(i) [formula], [formula];

(ii) f1 and f2 are twice differentiable in R+;

(iii) there exists the real constants α,β such that 0  ≤  α  <  β and

[formula]

for all x  >  0 then we have the inequalities:

[formula]

for all a,b∈(0,  ∞  ).

The following inequality involving log-mean is also known in the literature:

[formula]

where, [formula], b  ≠  a is the well-known logarithmic mean.

Finally, the expressions ([\ref=eq6]) and ([\ref=eq16]) lead us to the following inequality:

[formula]

Difference of Means

Let us rewrite the inequalities ([\ref=eq13]) as

[formula]

In view of ([\ref=eq18]), let us consider the following nonnegative differences

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

The inequalities ([\ref=eq18]) still admits more nonnegative differences, but they are already studied before.

Now, we shall prove the convexity of the above differences ([\ref=eq19])-([\ref=eq23]).

The means given by ([\ref=eq19])-([\ref=eq23]) are nonnegative and convex in R2+.

We shall use Lemma 1.1 to prove the above theorem. We shall write each measure in the form of generating function, and then give their first and second order derivatives. According to Lemma 1.1 it is sufficient to show that the second order derivative in each case is nonnegative.

[formula] For MSL(a,b): We can write

[formula]

where

[formula]

Writing the first and second order derivatives of fSL(x), we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

where

[formula]

We can easily check that

[formula]

Since A(a,b)  ≥  L(a,b), this gives that f''AL(x)  ≥  0, [formula]. Moreover, [formula].

[formula] For MAL(a,b): We can write

[formula]

where

[formula]

Writing the first and second order derivatives of fAL(x), we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since A(a,b)  ≥  L(a,b), this gives that f''AL(x)  ≥  0, [formula]. Moreover, [formula].

[formula] For MN2L(a,b): We can write

[formula]

where

[formula]

Writing the first and second order derivatives of fN2L(x), we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

The above graph of the function f''N2L(x) is given by

From the above graph we observe that the function k1(x) is nonnegative for all x∈(0,  ∞  ), and consequently, f''N2L(x)  ≥  0, [formula].

Moreover, [formula]. Also we have

[formula]

[formula] For MN3L(a,b): We can write

[formula]

where

[formula]

Writing the first and second order derivatives of fN3L(x), we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

The graph of the function f''N3L(x) is given by

From the above graph we observe that the function f''N3L(x) is nonnegative for all x∈(0,  ∞  ), and consequently, f''N3L(x)  ≥  0, [formula].

Moreover, [formula]. Also we have

[formula]

[formula] For MN1L(a,b): We can write

[formula]

where

[formula]

Writing the first and second order derivatives of fN1L(x), we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

The graph of the function f''N1L(x) is given by

From the above graph we observe that the function f''N1L(x) is nonnegative for all x∈(0,  ∞  ), and consequently, f''N1L(x)  ≥  0, [formula].

Moreover, [formula]. Also we have

[formula]

We see that in all the cases the generating function f(  ·  )(1)  =  f'(  ·  )(1)  =  0 and the second derivative is positive for all x∈(0,  ∞  ). This proves the nonegativity and convexity of the means ([\ref=eq19])-([\ref=eq23]) in R2+. This completes the proof of the theorem.

Log-Mean Inequalities

In view of ([\ref=eq18]), the following inequalities are obvious

[formula]

Here we shall prove an improvement over the inequalities ([\ref=eq31]). While, the improvement over the inequalities ([\ref=eq32])-([\ref=eq34]) is already given in ([\ref=eq9])-([\ref=eq11]). The following theorem holds:

Proof of the theorem 3.2. Propositions 3.1-3.3 together proves the inequalities ([\ref=eq35]) and the propositions 3.4-3.5 proves the inequalities ([\ref=eq36]).

Remarks

In this section we shall give some remarks based on the Theorem 3.1 given in section 3.

Following the similar lines of Theorem 3.1, still we can prove that

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

The convexity of the measures MSH(a,b), MAG(a,b) and MSN1(a,b) can be seen in Taneja [\cite=tan3]

The following inequalities hold:

[formula]

and

[formula]

We know that the following inequalities hold:

[formula]

and

[formula]

The proof of the inequalities ([\ref=eq56]) and ([\ref=eq57]) can be seen in Taneja [\cite=tan3].

Inequalities ([\ref=eq56]) together with ([\ref=eq51]) and ([\ref=eq52]) give ([\ref=eq54]). Inequalities ([\ref=eq57]) together with ([\ref=eq53]) give ([\ref=eq55]). Still we need to show that

[formula]

i.e.,

[formula]

In order to show this let us consider the difference

[formula]

where

[formula]

The graph of the function fT1(x) is given by

From the above graph it is clear that T1(a,b)  ≥  0. Proving the inequalities ([\ref=eq58]), consequently, proving ([\ref=eq54]).

The following inequalities hold

[formula]

Simplifying the inequalities ([\ref=eq34]) and ([\ref=eq35]) given in Theorem 3.1, we get

[formula]

and

[formula]

respectively.

Combining the above two inequalities ([\ref=eq60]) and ([\ref=eq61]), we can get ([\ref=eq59]) provided the following hold

[formula]

In order to prove inequalities ([\ref=eq62]), let us consider the difference

[formula]

where

[formula]

The graph of the function fT2(x),    x  >  0,  x  ≠  1 is given by

From the above graph we observe that the function fT2(x),    x  >  0,  x  ≠  1, is nonnegative with fT2(1)  =  0. Thus we conclude that the validity of the expression ([\ref=eq54]) proving the inequalities ([\ref=eq51]).

There is no relation between the expressions

[formula]

and

[formula]

This we shall show by simple example. Let us write the difference

[formula]

where

[formula]

By simple calculations, we have

fT3(0.00001)  =    -  0.00337512758 and fT3()  =  0.0001321351.

Thus we have two values, one negative and another positive proving that we can't have relation between these two measures.

The followings hold

[formula]

In view of ([\ref=eq60]), it is sufficient to show that

[formula]

Let us write

[formula]

where

[formula]

The graph of the function fT4(x) is given by

From the graph above it is clear that T4(a,b)  ≥  0. Proving the inequalities ([\ref=eq63]).
