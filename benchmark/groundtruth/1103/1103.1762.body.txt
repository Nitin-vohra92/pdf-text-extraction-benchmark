Neutron skin of 208Pb, nuclear symmetry energy, and the parity radius experiment

New interest in masses and density distributions of nuclei is being prompted by the production of rare isotopes in radioactive beam facilities [\cite=enam08]. Exciting phenomena discovered in these isotopes such as thick skins, halos, and new shell closures urge better understanding of neutrons in nuclei. Yet, our knowledge of neutron density distributions is limited even in the stable nuclei. As neutrons are uncharged, neutron densities have been probed mostly by nucleon scattering [\cite=hof80] [\cite=zen10], α scattering [\cite=kra04], and nuclear effects in exotic atoms [\cite=klo07] [\cite=fried09]. Even if some of these experiments reach small errors, all hadronic probes require model assumptions to deal with the strong force introducing possible systematic uncertainties.

Parity-violating electron scattering (PVES) was suggested as a model-independent probe of neutron densities [\cite=don89]. An electroweak probe is not hindered by the complexity of the strong force and the reaction mechanism with the nucleus needs not be modeled [\cite=don89] [\cite=vret00] [\cite=prex2], similarly to clean electron scattering for nuclear charge densities. The novel parity radius experiment (PREX) at the Jefferson Lab [\cite=prex1] [\cite=prex2] aims to measure the parity-violating asymmetry Apv in polarized electron scattering on 208Pb to 3% accuracy. This accuracy is estimated to constrain the neutron rms radius rn of 208Pb to 1% [\cite=prex1] [\cite=prex2]. Currently, rn of 208Pb is uncertain by ~  2% and data may be model dependent [\cite=hof80] [\cite=zen10] [\cite=kra04] [\cite=klo07] [\cite=fried09] [\cite=cen10]; in contrast, the charge radius of 208Pb is accurately known as rch  =  5.5010(9) fm [\cite=ang04]. In recent years it has been established that the neutron skin thickness Δrnp  =  rn  -  rp (difference of the neutron and proton rms radii) of 208Pb is strongly correlated with the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy around saturation [\cite=bro00] [\cite=fur02] [\cite=ste05a] [\cite=todd05] [\cite=cen09]. Knowledge of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy is a cornerstone for drip lines, masses, densities, and collective excitations of neutron-rich nuclei [\cite=bro00] [\cite=fur02] [\cite=ste05a] [\cite=cen09] [\cite=todd05] [\cite=chen10] [\cite=carbone10], flows and multifragmentation in heavy-ion collisions [\cite=li08] [\cite=tsa09], and for astrophysical phenomena like supernovae, neutrino emission, and neutron stars [\cite=hor01] [\cite=ste05a] [\cite=xu09] [\cite=stei10]. A constraint from PREX on Δrnp of 208Pb is thus regarded as a landmark for isospin physics. In addition to being important for its own sake, it has broad implications for different communities of nuclear physics and astrophysics. Fostered by the seminal study of Ref. [\cite=prex2], PREX completed an initial run in 2010. First analyses [\cite=prex1] show the validity of the experimental technique, the adequacy of instruments, and that systematic errors are under control. Additional beam time is now under request to attain the planned 3% accuracy in the parity-violating asymmetry Apv [\cite=prex1].

The direct output of PREX is the value of the asymmetry Apv at a single scattering angle [\cite=prex1] [\cite=prex2]. The neutron rms radius rn of the nucleus may be deduced only if a shape for the neutron density such as a two-parameter Fermi function [\cite=prex2] is assumed. A systematic uncertainty in the analysis is unavoidable in this way. Here, we provide a different and accurate strategy to deduce rn and Δrnp from PREX that removes this problem. By study of PVES on 208Pb in successful nuclear mean field (MF) forces of wide use in nuclear research and astrophysical applications, we reveal a high linear relation between Δrnp and Apv that allows one to extract rn and Δrnp from Apv model and shape independently. Moreover, our approach unifies the extraction of Δrnp from Apv with the same framework where Δrnp is correlated to the symmetry energy. We show that the present method can support PREX to narrow down the value of the density slope of the nuclear symmetry energy to novel accuracy. This result provides a new and important motivation to continue the experiment to increased precision.

Electrons interact with nuclei by exchanging photons and Z0 bosons. The former mainly couple to protons and the latter to neutrons because, opposite to the nucleon electric charges, the neutron weak charge QnW =  - 1 is much larger than the proton weak charge [formula] (θW being the Weinberg angle). Therefore, electron scattering can probe both the electric and the weak charge distributions in a nucleus [\cite=don89] [\cite=prex2] [\cite=vret00]. PREX measures the elastic differential cross sections dσ± / dΩ for incident electrons of positive or negative helicity. The parity-violating asymmetry,

[formula]

for massless electrons (it is me / pe  ≈  0.0005 at PREX energy), is sensitive to the parity-violating term induced by the weak interaction in the scattering amplitude. According to their helicity, electrons interact with a potential VCoulomb(r)  ±  GFρW(r) / 23 / 2, with GF the Fermi constant and ρW the weak density of the target [\cite=don89] [\cite=vret00] [\cite=prex2]. We solve the associated Dirac equation via the exact phase-shift analysis in distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) [\cite=cen10] to compute Apv. Our benchmarks are the pointlike densities of protons ρp(r) and neutrons ρn(r) calculated self-consistently in MF models. We fold ρp(r) and ρn(r) with electromagnetic proton and neutron form factors to obtain the charge density [\cite=cen10], and with electric form factors for the coupling to a Z0 to obtain the weak density [\cite=cen10] [\cite=prex2] [\cite=moya10]: [formula].

Though not useful for realistic calculations, it is worth recalling the Born approximation (BA) to Apv [\cite=don89] [\cite=prex2]:

[formula]

as it nicely illustrates that Apv relates to the neutron and proton nuclear form factors Fn,p(q). Furnstahl [\cite=fur02] showed that [formula] is at low momentum transfer q strongly correlated with rn of 208Pb in nuclear MF models, evidencing that PREX would directly constrain the neutron radius and the symmetry energy. Realistic DWBA calculations of Apv in MF models can be found in [\cite=vret00] [\cite=moya10] [\cite=cen10] [\cite=ban10].

At the optimal kinematics of PREX the electron beam energy is 1.06 GeV and the scattering angle is [formula] (qlab   ≈   0.47 fm- 1) [\cite=prex1]. We compute Apv in DWBA at this kinematics in a comprehensive large sample of 47 nuclear MF interactions. We display the results in Fig. [\ref=alrrn] as a function of the neutron rms radius of 208Pb. To prevent eventual biases in our study, we avoid including more than two models of the same kind fitted by the same authors and protocol. We also avoid models yielding a charge radius of 208Pb away from experiment [\cite=ang04] by more than 1% (same level as the 1% pursued by PREX in rn). The considered models rest on very different theoretical grounds, from nonrelativistic models of zero range (models HFB, v090, and those starting with S or M) or finite range (D1S, D1N, BCP), to relativistic models with meson self-interactions (NL and PK models, FSUGold, G1, G2, TM1), density-dependent vertices (DD-ME, RHF-PK) or point couplings (DD-PC1, PC-PK1, PC-PF1) [\cite=cen09] [\cite=cen10] [\cite=carbone10] [\cite=chen10]. (NL3.s25 and PK1.s24 are variants of NL3 and PK1 giving Δrnp = 0.25 and 0.24 fm in 208Pb.) All such models accurately describe general properties of nuclei such as binding energies and charge radii along the periodic table. However, one readily sees in Fig. [\ref=alrrn] that the predicted rn of 208Pb varies largely, from 5.55 to 5.8 fm, as the isovector channel of the nuclear models is little constrained by current phenomenology. The models with softer (stiffer) symmetry energy at saturation density [\cite=cen10] yield smaller (larger) rn and larger (smaller) Apv. One notes that the information encoded in the models implies a value of about 0.67 to 0.75 ppm for Apv at PREX kinematics. A significant linear trend is found between Apv and rn (the correlation coefficient is r = 0.974).

As the experimental value of Apv is not yet available, we have chosen for study a plausible test value Apv = 0.715 ppm of 3% accuracy, depicted in Fig. [\ref=alrrn]. The assumed sample measurement of Apv determines through the linear fit shown in Fig. [\ref=alrrn] a fiducial neutron rms radius [formula] fm, within typical values deduced from hadronic probes [\cite=hof80] [\cite=zen10] [\cite=kra04] [\cite=klo07] [\cite=fried09]. Note that a 3% accuracy in Apv does lead to ~  1% accuracy in rn, thereby supporting the expectations of PREX. It is to be pointed out that the analysis described in this paper is actually independent of the exact value of the parity-violating asymmetry. Thus, once the experimental value of PREX is known, one can repeat the same type of analysis using the actual Apv instead of our test value. We also plot in Fig. [\ref=alrrn] the confidence band of the regression (boundary of the possible straight lines) and the so-called prediction band (the wider band that basically coincides with the envelope of the models in the figure) at 95% confidence level [\cite=regres].

While one first thinks of using a PREX extraction of rn to constrain Δrnp of 208Pb, we show in Fig. [\ref=alrrnp] that Apv and Δrnp have themselves a very high linear dependence (the correlation coefficient is 0.995). The small fluctuation of Apv with the charge density is more effectively removed by analyzing Apv vs rn - rp. Actually, the correlation of Apv and Δrnp is implicit in the BA. That is, expanding Eq. ([\ref=apvpwba]) at [formula] yields Fn(q) / Fp(q)  →  1  -  (rn + rp)(rn - rp)q2 / 6, which is driven by rn - rp (rn + rp≃11.1 fm changes by less than 3% in the models). Though Coulomb distortions correct Apv by more than 30-40%, the correlation prevails in the DWBA result. One sees in Fig. [\ref=alrrnp] that any nuclear model accurately calibrated to masses and charge radii nearly falls on the best-fit line and that the confidence band of the regression is very narrow. Looking at Fig. [\ref=alrrn], it can be realized that different models, similarly successful for the well-known observables, can give the same Apv with different rn (cf. MSkA, BCP, and SkM*; Sk-Rs, Ska, and FSUGold; SkI5 and G2), but almost the same Δrnp are obtained with these forces. That the prediction band of the regression is wider horizontally in Fig. [\ref=alrrn] than in Fig. [\ref=alrrnp] points to the same fact. Thus, one expects more accurate estimates of neutron observables using the correlation of Fig. [\ref=alrrnp]. Having found Δrnp, one can get rn by unfolding the finite size of the proton charge from the accurate 208Pb charge radius [\cite=ang04]. We note that our analysis allows one to deduce Δrnp and rn from Apv without assuming any particular shape for the nucleon density profiles. Altogether, we believe our results firmly back the commissioning of an improved PREX run where Apv can be measured more accurately. The present method will permit to retain in Δrnp and rn most of the experiment's accuracy. As recently proposed [\cite=ban10], if rn is first precisely known, then a second measurement can be made at higher energy to constrain the surface thickness of the neutron density of 208Pb.

The correlation of Apv with Δrnp is universal in the realm of mean field theory as it is based on widely different nuclear functionals. It is of interest to get further indications on it by looking at existing experiments. The 208Pb neutron densities found via proton elastic scattering at 0.8 GeV in [\cite=hof80] and 0.3 GeV in [\cite=zen10] were both deduced from the data in a way consistent with the experimental charge density of 208Pb (known by electron elastic scattering). We computed Apv using the neutron and charge densities quoted in these works and plotted the results in Fig. [\ref=alrrnp] against the central Δrnp value of each experiment (0.14 fm in [\cite=hof80] and 0.21 fm in [\cite=zen10]). We did the same with the data deduced from the antiprotonic 208Pb atom [\cite=klo07] (now using the Fermi nucleon densities of Table VI of [\cite=klo07]). It is seen that the theoretical correlation of the models nicely agrees with these points. Our test value Apv = 0.715 ppm of 3% accuracy from PREX would give Δrnp as 0.195  ±  0.057 fm (see Fig. [\ref=alrrnp]). As reviewed in [\cite=cen10], we may recall that the recent constraints from strong probes, isospin diffusion, and pygmy dipole resonances favor a range 0.15-0.22 fm for the central value of Δrnp(208Pb). Recent informations on the nuclear equation of state derived from observed masses and radii of neutron stars suggest a similar range 0.14-0.20 fm [\cite=stei10] [\cite=hebe10].

Finally, we analyze how PREX can constrain the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy Esym(ρ) around normal density ρ0, which is characterized by the slope coefficient L  =  3ρ0  ∂Esym(ρ)  /  ∂ρ|ρ0 in the literature [\cite=cen09] [\cite=chen10] [\cite=carbone10] [\cite=li08] [\cite=tsa09]. A larger L value implies a higher pressure in neutron matter and a thicker neutron skin in 208Pb. Interest in L permeates many areas of active research, such as the structure and the reactions of neutron-rich nuclei [\cite=cen09] [\cite=todd05] [\cite=chen10] [\cite=carbone10] [\cite=li08] [\cite=tsa09] [\cite=ste05a], the physics of neutron stars [\cite=hor01] [\cite=xu09] [\cite=stei10], and events like giant flares [\cite=flares09] and gravitational radiation from neutron stars [\cite=wen09]. The available empirical estimates span a rather loose range [formula] MeV, with the recent constraints seemingly agreeing on a value around [formula] MeV with ±  25 MeV spread [\cite=cen09] [\cite=chen10] [\cite=carbone10] [\cite=li08] [\cite=tsa09]. A microscopic calculation with realistic nucleon-nucleon potentials and three-body forces predicts L = 66.5 MeV [\cite=vid09]. Figure [\ref=alrL] displays the correlation between Δrnp(208Pb) and L [\cite=cen09] [\cite=chen10] [\cite=carbone10] in the present analysis. Imposing the previous constraint Δrnp = 0.195  ±  0.057 fm yields L = 64  ±  39 MeV. While the central value depends on our test assumption Apv = 0.715 ppm, the spread following from a determination of Apv to 3% accuracy, essentially does not. Then, we have to conclude that a 3% accuracy in Apv sets modest constraints on L, implying that some of the expectations that this measurement will constrain L precisely may have to be revised to some extent. To narrow down L, though demanding more experimental effort, a ~  1% measurement of Apv should be sought ultimately in PREX. Our approach can support it to yield a new accuracy near δΔrnp  ~  0.02 fm and δL  ~  10 MeV well below any previous constraint. Moreover, PREX is unique in that the central value of Δrnp and L follows from a probe largely free of strong force uncertainties.

In summary, PREX ought to be instrumental to pave the way for electroweak studies of neutron densities in heavy nuclei [\cite=prex1] [\cite=prex2] [\cite=ban10]. To accurately extract the neutron radius and skin of 208Pb from the experiment requires a precise connection between the parity-violating asymmetry Apv and these properties. We investigated parity-violating electron scattering in nuclear models constrained by available laboratory data to support this extraction without specific assumptions on the shape of the nucleon densities. We demonstrated a linear correlation, universal in the mean field framework, between Apv and Δrnp that has very small scatter. Because of its high quality, it will not spoil the experimental accuracy even in improved measurements of Apv. With a 1% measurement of Apv it can allow to constrain the slope L of the symmetry energy to near a novel 10 MeV level. A mostly model-independent determination of Δrnp of 208Pb and L should have enduring impact on a variety of fields, including atomic parity nonconservation and low-energy tests of the Standard Model [\cite=prex2] [\cite=vret00] [\cite=sil05].
