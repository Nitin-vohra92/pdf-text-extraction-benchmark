The tame and the wild automorphisms of an affine quadric threefold

Introduction

A landmark result about the automorphism group of the complex affine space [formula] is the proof by Shestakov and Umirbaev [\cite=SU:main] that there exist some wild automorphisms in [formula], which are defined as automorphisms that cannot be written as a composition of finitely many triangular and affine automorphisms. Since then some technical aspects of the proof have been substantially simplified and generalized (see [\cite=MY] [\cite=ku:ineq] [\cite=Ku:main] [\cite=Ve]); however we feel that we still lack a full understanding of why the proof works.

In this note we try to gain insights on the problem by transposing the question to another affine threefold, namely the underlying variety of [formula]. Note that if [formula] is a smooth projective quadric, and [formula] is the complement of a hyperplane section, then V is either isomorphic to [formula], or to [formula] (if the hyperplane H was tangent to Q3).

Another reason to think that [formula] should be a close analogue to [formula] comes from the dimension 2. If we repeat the previous construction for a smooth quadric surface [formula], we obtain either an affine quadric isomorphic to {y2  -  xz  =  0} or the affine plane [formula]. The automorphism groups of these affine surfaces are well-known [\cite=ML] [\cite=Lam]: both admit presentations as amalgamated products over two factors, and it is not clear how to point out any qualitative difference between both situations.

The story becomes more interesting in dimension 3, and this is the main point of this note: we claim that the group [formula], even if still huge, is in some sense more rigid than [formula]. It is quite straightforward to define a natural notion of elementary automorphism in the new context, hence also a notion of tame automorphism. By contrast with the situation of [formula], it is possible to prove that any tame automorphism admits an elementary reduction, the reduction concerning the degree of the automorphism. In particular, there is no need to adapt the notion of (non-elementary) reductions of type I-IV of Shestakov and Umirbaev, or of "Shestakov-Umirbaev reduction" which are their counterparts in the terminology of Kuroda.

As a consequence, we are able to give a self-contained short proof of the existence of wild automorphisms in [formula]. This might indicate that [formula] is a good toy model to test any attempt for an alternative, hopefully more geometric proof of the result of Shestakov and Umirbaev, which would work in positive characteristic.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section [\ref=sec:tame], we introduce the tame group of [formula] together with some technical definitions, and we state our main result.

Section [\ref=sec:para] is devoted to a proof of a version of the "parachute" inequality, which was already a key ingredient in the case of [formula].

Then in Section [\ref=sec:proof] we are able to give a short proof of the main result.

As a consequence we can easily produce some wild automorphisms on [formula]: this is done in Section [\ref=sec:wild]. Note that another natural generalization of [formula] would be to consider the complement of a smooth quadric in [formula] (since [formula] is the complement of a plane). This gives rises to the underlying variety of [formula]. We indicate at the end of the paper how to adapt our construction to this case.

After this work was completed, Ivan Arzhantsev and Sergey Gaıfullin kindly indicated to us the existence of their work [\cite=AG]. In their § 6 a wild automorphism on the 3-dimensional quadric affine cone is produced. The example is essentially the same as ours but the techniques involved in the proof are quite different; in particular they do not rely on a generalization of the Shestakov-Umirbaev theory, which is our main point.

The tame group of [formula]

Elementary automorphisms

We work over the field of complex numbers [formula].

As mentioned in the introduction we find convenient to identify [formula] with the space of 2 by 2 matrices, and to choose our smooth affine quadric to be given by the determinant q  =  x1x4  -  x2x3:

[formula]

The group structure on [formula] will be useful to describe some automorphisms of the underlying variety, but is by no mean essential.

An automorphism F of [formula] is given by the restriction of an endomorphism on [formula]

[formula]

where [formula]. Note that the fi's are only defined up to the ideal (q - 1), and that we do not assume a priori that [formula] define an automorphism of [formula]. We usually simply write

[formula]

The composition of two automorphisms F and G is denoted [formula], and should not be confused with the matrix multiplication we use in the definitions below. A word of warning: even if the terminology we are about to introduce is inspired by [\cite=Ku:main], we differ from Kuroda in one crucial point: we consider automorphisms of an affine variety, and not of the corresponding algebra. As a consequence, our composition [formula] would be denoted [formula] by Kuroda...

Recall that an elementary automorphism in the context of the affine space [formula] is an automorphism of the form (x1,x2,x3)  ↦  (x1  +  P(x2,x3),x2,x3), up to permutation of the variables. A natural generalization in the context of [formula] is to consider automorphisms preserving two coordinates in the matrix. One can obtain such automorphisms by multiplication by a triangular matrix: for instance if [formula] then we can consider automorphisms of the form

[formula]

It turns out to be useful to allow some coefficients; so we shall say that is the group of elementary automorphisms of type E34.

One can make a similar construction multiplying on the right and/or using an upper triangular matrix. One then obtains three other types of elementary automorphisms:

[formula]

The union of these four groups is the set (not the group!) of elementary automorphisms, denoted by

[formula]

Affine automorphisms

If a linear endomorphism F of [formula] induces an automorphism on [formula], then by homogeneity of q we see that F preserves all levels of the determinant, which is a non-degenerate quadratic form on [formula]: [formula] In particular F is an element of the complex orthogonal group [formula]. Note that these automorphisms are exactly the ones that extend biregularly to the natural compactification of [formula] as a smooth quadric in [formula]. So in this sense [formula] plays the same role as the affine group for [formula].

It is a classical fact (see [\cite=FH]) that [formula] is isomorphic to [formula]. We can explicitely recover this isomorphism in our setting by looking at the action of [formula] on [formula] by multiplication on both sides:

[formula]

This gives an embedding of [formula] into [formula], and adding the transpose automorphism

[formula]

we recover the whole complex orthogonal group [formula].

Tame and wild automorphisms

We define the tame subgroup of [formula] as the group generated by elementary automorphisms and [formula]. An element of [formula] is called wild if it is not tame.

Composing an element from E34 and another from E13 we construct the tame automorphism

This automorphism is the exponential of the locally nilpotent derivation h(x2)∂ where

[formula]

Note that not only x2 but also the trace x1 + x4 is in the kernel of ∂. In particular, taking the exponential of (x1 + x4)∂ we obtain the automorphism

As a consequence of our main result stated below we prove in § [\ref=sec:wild] that σ is a wild automorphism.

A degree on [formula]

For [formula], we define the degree of f as an element of [formula] by taking

[formula]

and using the graded lexicographic order on [formula]: we first compare the sums of the coefficients and, in case of a tie, apply the lexicographic order. So (recall that q is the determinant, defining the affine quadric)

[formula]

By convention deg 0  =    -    ∞  , with -    ∞   smaller than any element of [formula]. The leading part of a polynomial

[formula]

will be denoted [formula], hence

[formula]

Remark that [formula] is not in general a monomial; for instance [formula]. The notation [formula], for weight, is borrowed from Kuroda, and intends to recall that the leading part is relative to the particular choice of weights [formula] we made (note that to recover the notation of [\cite=Ku:main] one has to transpose this matrix).

A degree on [formula]

We are not so much interested by the degree of elements inside [formula] but more in the quotient by the ideal (q - 1) which corresponds to [formula]. To do this, we use a classical trick (see [\cite=KML] [\cite=Z]) starting from the global [formula]: we define the desired degree, simply denoted deg , as follows: if [formula] is the class of a polynomial f in [formula] then we set

[formula]

Remark that if   =   then the following equivalence holds:

[formula]

and we will call such a p a good representative of [formula]. Let us now check that deg  is in turn a degree function i.e. that

deg  =  -   ∞    ⇔   = 0,

deg (1  +  2)  ≤   max { deg 1, deg 2},

deg 12  =   deg 1  +   deg 2, [formula].

The first equivalence is easy. For the two other facts, we pick p1 and p2 good representatives of the i's. One has [formula] hence, by definition of deg , one has

[formula]

As for the third equality, it suffices to prove that p1p2 is a good representative of 12 i.e. that [formula]. This is the case since [formula] and (q) is a prime ideal.

We also need to define the leading part of an element of [formula]. By abuse of notation, we still denote this by [formula], and define it as follows:

[formula]

Remark that, in contrast with [formula] on [formula], the elements [formula] and [formula] do not belong to the same set anymore:

[formula]

One has to check that the definition is independent of the choice of the good representative. Let us take two good representatives p1, p2 of the same [formula], then p2 - p1∈(q - 1) whence [formula]. But [formula], [formula] or [formula] and since [formula] only the last one is possible, thereby giving: [formula].

From now on, we drop the bars and work directly with regular functions on [formula]. So for example, x1,x2,x3,x4 should be understood as their restrictions to [formula].

Elementary reductions and main result

If [formula] are elements in [formula] such that [formula], we define [formula].

We say that [formula] is an elementary reduction of F if E∈E and [formula].

We denote by A the set of tame automorphisms that admit a sequence of elementary reductions to an element of [formula].

The main result of this note is then:

Any tame automorphism of [formula] is an element of A.

The parachute

In this section we shall obtain a minoration for the degree of a polynomial in two algebraically independent regular functions [formula]. For this, we adapt the techniques used in [\cite=Ve] (see also [\cite=SU:ineq] [\cite=ku:ineq]) where the fi's were in [formula].

Generic degree

Given [formula], consider [formula] a non-zero polynomial in two variables. Generically (on the coefficients Ri,j of R), deg R(f1,f2) coincides with ged  R where ged   (standing for generic degree) is the weighted degree on [formula] defined by

[formula]

again with the graded lexicographic order. Namely we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the leading part of R with respect to the generic degree and LDT represents the Lower (generic) Degree Terms. One has

[formula]

unless [formula], in which case the degree falls: deg R(f1,f2) < ged  R.

Let us focus on the condition [formula]. Of course this can happen only if [formula] and [formula] are algebraically dependent. Remark that the ideal

[formula]

must then be principal, prime and generated by a ged  -homogeneous polynomial. The only possibility is that I = (Xs11  -  λXs22) where [formula], s1 deg f1 = s2 deg f2 and s1,s2 are coprime. To sum up, in the case where [formula] and [formula] are algebraically dependent one has

[formula]

where H = Xs11  -  λXs22.

Pseudo-Jacobians

If f1,f2,f3,f4 are polynomials in [formula], we denote by [formula] the Jacobian determinant, i.e. the determinant of the Jacobian 4  ×  4- matrix [formula]. Then we define the pseudo-Jacobian of f1,f2,f3 by the formula

[formula]

If [formula] and gi  =  fi  +  (q - 1)hi, for [formula], then the pseudo-Jacobians   j  (g1,g2,g3) and   j  (f1,f2,f3) are equal up to an element in the ideal (q - 1). In particular, if [formula], the pseudo-Jacobian   j  (f1,f2,f3) is a well-defined element of [formula].

This is an easy consequence of the following two observations:

The Jacobian [formula] and, consequently, the pseudo-Jacobian   j   as well, are [formula]-derivations in each of their entries;

One has [formula].

Assume [formula]. Then

[formula]

An easy computation shows the following inequality:

[formula]

Recalling the definitions of   j   and deg  we obtain:

[formula]

Assuming fi to be a good representative of fi + (q - 1), that is [formula] for i = 1,2,3, we get, [formula],

[formula]

We shall essentially use those pseudo-Jacobians with f1 = x1,x2,x3 or x4. Therefore we introduce the notation   j  k(  ·  ,  ·  ): =   j  (xk,  ·  ,  ·  ) for all k = 1,2,3,4. The inequality from Lemma [\ref=lem:pseudojac] gives

[formula]

from which we deduce

[formula]

We shall also need the following observation.

If f1,f2 are algebraically independent functions in [formula], then the   j  k(f1,f2), [formula], are not simultaneously zero.

In particular max k = 1,2,3,4 deg   j  k(f1,f2)  ≠    -    ∞   or, equivalently,

[formula]

Assume that   j  (xk,f1,f2) = 0 [formula]. Then the four derivations ∂k: =   j  (xk,f1,  ·  ) have both f1 and f2 in their kernel. We now need the following well-known relation between the transcendence degree and the dimension of a derivations (see e.g. [\cite=L] ): if K  ⊂  L is a characteristic 0 field extension then

[formula]

Applied to [formula] this gives that any two [formula]-derivations are proportional so [formula], any two ∂k, ∂l are non-trivially related: a∂k + b∂l = 0. Evaluating this equality in xk and xl gives that ∂k(xl) =   j  (xk,f1,xl) = ∂l(xk) = 0 for all k,l∈{1,2,3,4}. It follows that all the derivations ∂kl: =   j  (xk,xl,  ·  ) are [formula]-derivations and, applying ([\ref=trdeg=dim]) again with [formula] it follows that any such three ∂kl are related e.g. a∂12 + b∂13 + c∂23 = 0 with a,b,c not all zero. Again evaluating it on x1, x2, x3 gives   j  (x1,x2,x3) = 0 (and the same holds for any triple in {1,2,3,4}). This means that [formula] (with the xi's regarded as elements of [formula]) is zero, a contradiction.

The parachute

In this section [formula] are algebraically independent, and we denote by [formula] the degree deg fi. We define the parachute of f1,f2 to be

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem:pastousnul], we immediately remark that [formula].

Assume [formula] coincides with the generic degree [formula]. Then

[formula]

As already remarked [formula],   j   and now   j  k as well are [formula]-derivations in each of their entries. We may then apply the chain rule on   j  k(f1,  ·  ) evaluated in R(f1,f2):

[formula]

Now taking the degree and applying inequality ([\ref=ineqjb]) (with R(f1,f2) instead of f2), we obtain

[formula]

We deduce

[formula]

By induction, for any n  ≥  1 we have

[formula]

Now if the integer n is as given in the statement one gets:

[formula]

which, together with the previous inequality, gives the result.

Let H be the generating relation between [formula] and [formula] as in the equivalence ([\ref=rel]) and [formula] such that [formula]. Then n fulfills the assumption of Lemma [\ref=lem:ineq1] i.e.

[formula]

It suffices to remark that [formula] and that [formula] implies [formula]. One concludes by induction.

Remark that, by definition of n in Lemma [\ref=lem:goodn] above, one has [formula] which together with Lemma [\ref=lem:ineq1] gives (recall that s1d1 = s2d2)

[formula]

The minoration

Now we come to the main result of this section, which is a close analogue of [\cite=Ku:main].

Let n be as in Lemma [\ref=lem:goodn]. If n = 0 then deg R(f1,f2) = ged  R  ≥   deg f1 by the assumption [formula] and then deg (f2R(f1,f2))  ≥   deg f2  +   deg f1  >   deg f1 as wanted.

If n  ≥  1 then, by ([\ref=last]),

[formula]

and, since [formula],

[formula]

We obtain

[formula]

The assumption [formula] forbids s1 to be equal to one, hence we get the desired minoration.

Proof of the main result

In this section we prove the following proposition, which immediately implies Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

The proposition is clear when [formula]. From now on we assume that

[formula]

The result is also clear if [formula]. We assume the following induction hypothesis:

For practical reasons we introduce the notation:

[formula]

and rewrite the induction hypothesis in an equivalent formulation:

We shall use the following basic observation repetitively.

Let [formula], and [formula]. Then F∈A if and only if the following equivalent conditions hold:

[formula];

[formula];

[formula].

F∈A  ⇔  (i): It is sufficient to prove one implication. Assume F∈A. Then F admits an elementary reduction [formula], say with E∈E13:

[formula]

Let R(x2,x4)  =  abP(bx2,ax4), and define [formula]

Then [formula], hence the result.

F∈A  ⇔  (ii): This is just a special case of the previous equivalence with a = b.

F∈A  ⇔  (iii): Using the equality

[formula]

and (ii) it suffices to restrict to the case a = 1. If we denote [formula] the right-multiplication by [formula] one easily checks that [formula] (actually conjugation under R only exchanges E13 and E24) and that R does not affect the degree. It follows that sequences of elementary reductions of F and of [formula] are in one to one correspondence.

We are back now with the setting of Proposition [\ref=pro:main]. Since F∈A, there exists an elementary automorphism E' such that [formula] and [formula] i.e. [formula]. Up to conjugacy, and using Lemma [\ref=lem:inA](i), we can assume

[formula]

We distinguish three cases according to the form of the automorphism E in the proposition: E∈E13, E∈E24 or E∈E12 (the case E∈E34 is equivalent to the latter one, up to conjugacy).

Case E∈E13

We have

[formula]

Since [formula] we can use Induction Hypothesis [\ref=IH] to conclude.

This case is extremely simple, but in the following cases it will be convenient to use commutative diagrams, such as the one in Figure [\ref=fig:easy], to visualize the argument. The vertices of the diagram correspond to tame automorphisms, and the arrows are either composition (on the left) by one elementary automorphism or a change of coefficients allowed by Lemma [\ref=lem:inA] below. We distinguish automorphisms which are proven in the text to be in A< F, and Induction Hypothesis [\ref=IH] means that for any arrow pointing on such an automorphism, the initial automorphism is in A.

For the next two more substantial cases we shall need the following lemma.

Let [formula]. If E∈E13 and [formula], then

[formula]

for any relation [formula].

One has f1f4 - f2f3 = 1 and the fi's are not constant hence the leading parts must cancel one another: [formula]. It follows: deg f1  +   deg f4  =   deg f2  +   deg f3 and then

[formula]

Similarly

[formula]

hence

[formula]

which gives the desired equivalences.

Case E∈E24

Using Lemma [\ref=lem:inA](i), we can assume that [formula] so we have

[formula]

If P(f2,f4) is not constant, the inequality [formula] implies deg   f1  >   deg   f2 and deg   f3  >   deg   f4. But then [formula], a contradiction.

Hence P(f2,f4)  =  p is a constant, and deg   f1  =   deg   f2, deg   f3  =   deg   f4. This in turn implies Q(x1,x3)  =  q is a constant.

If pq  ≠  1, we define [formula], [formula] and we compute

[formula]

By assumption, [formula]. By Induction Hypothesis [\ref=IH], and since, here, the multiplication by [formula] does not change the degree (the second column is added a scalar multiple of the first one which has a strictly smaller degree), we have

[formula]

Using the Induction Hypothesis again, we get [formula]. Thus by ([\ref=eq:prs]) we have [formula], and using Lemma [\ref=lem:inA](ii) we obtain (see Figure [\ref=fig:pqnot1])

[formula]

If pq  =  1, we write

[formula]

By Induction Hypothesis [\ref=IH] we have [formula], and using Lemma [\ref=lem:inA](iii) we obtain (see Figure [\ref=fig:pq=1])

[formula]

Case E∈E12

Using Lemma [\ref=lem:inA](i), we can assume that [formula] so we have

[formula]

Assume first that Minoration [\ref=mino:para] is applicable to both P(f2,f4) and Q(f3,f4). We obtain the contradictory sequence of inequalities:

[formula]

We conclude with the following lemma.

If Minoration [\ref=mino:para] is not applicable to either P(f2,f4) or Q(f3,f4), i.e. if

[formula]

then [formula].

(i) Assume [formula] (see Figure [\ref=fig:Q]).

Then one checks: [formula]. Using Induction Hypothesis [\ref=IH] we get [formula] and, applying it once again in order to get [formula], we are left to prove that [formula]. For this, we remark that F and [formula] resp. [formula] and [formula] have the same 3rd component: f3 resp. f3': = f3 + f4P(f2,f4). By Lemma [\ref=lem:basic], the assumption [formula] translates in deg f3' <  deg f3 but this in turn translates in [formula] and we are done since, by assumption, [formula].

(ii) Assume [formula] (see Figure [\ref=fig:Q]).

Then there exists [formula] such that deg   f2 + f4(f4) <  deg   f2. We take [formula], and we have [formula] by case (i). Thus [formula]. We conclude using Induction Hypothesis [\ref=IH] on [formula] where [formula].

(iii) Assume [formula] (see Figure [\ref=fig:P]).

Consider [formula]. First by Induction Hypothesis [\ref=IH] we have [formula]. If we can prove [formula] then we can use the Induction Hypothesis again to obtain [formula]. But this is done as follows, using a similar argument as in case (i). We note that f2 is the second coordinate of both F and [formula], and f2  +  f4Q(f3,f4) is the second coordinate of both [formula] and [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:basic] the assumption [formula] is equivalent to deg f2  +  f4Q(f3,f4)  ≤   deg f2, which in turn in equivalent to [formula]. This gives the result, since [formula].

(iv) Finally assume [formula] (see Figure [\ref=fig:P]).

There exists [formula] such that deg   f3 + f4P̃(f4) <  deg   f3. We take [formula], and we have [formula] by Case [\ref=case:easy]. Thus [formula]. We conclude using case (iii).

Examples of wild automorphisms

The case of [formula]

We consider automorphisms σn of the form exp ((x1 + x4)n∂), where ∂ is the locally nilpotent derivation that we introduced in § [\ref=intro:tame]. We have

[formula]

The automorphism σ of the introduction corresponds to n  =  1.

Now assume that σn admits an elementary reduction [formula]. Since the degree of the second coordinate cannot decrease, by Lemma [\ref=lem:basic] we see that E∈E13 or E34.

Since both cases are symmetrical, we only consider the former one. By Lemma [\ref=lem:inA] we can assume that

[formula]

Computing the leading parts of the coordinates of σn, which are [formula], we see that

[formula]

This implies that xn4 is in [formula], which is contradictory. Hence σn does not admit an elementary reduction, and by Theorem [\ref=thm:main] we conclude that σn is not a tame automorphism.

The case of [formula]

One can adapt the discussion of this note to the case of the automorphism group of the complement of a smooth quadric surface in [formula]; in other words to the context of [formula]. Consider the double cover

[formula]

Clearly if [formula] commutes with [formula] then it induces an automorphism [formula] such that [formula]. The following observation was pointed to us by Jérémy Blanc:

Let F be an automorphim of [formula]. Then there exists [formula] such that [formula].

An automorphism F of [formula] is given by four homogeneous polynomial fi of the same degree. If F is linear, the surface {q  =  0} is preserved by F; and in the non-linear case the locus [formula] corresponds to divisors in [formula] contracted by F, which must be supported on q  =  0. In both cases we obtain that the polynomial [formula] is a power of q, up to a constant. Multiplying the fi by a constant, we can thus assume [formula]. The same remark applies to the four homogeneous polynomial gi associated with F- 1. Thus [formula] anf [formula], viewed now as endomorphisms of [formula], preserve the level q  =  1, or in other words [formula]. We have

[formula]

where H  =  cqn is a power of q up to a constant c satisfying [formula]. Hence c  =    ±  1. Multiplying if necessary the fi by a square root of - 1 (but not touching the gi), we can remove the sign and obtain an automorphism f on [formula], with inverse g, and which by definition satisfies [formula].

Note that the automorphism f given by the proposition commutes with [formula] and is uniquely defined up to a sign.

Now we can define for instance the group [formula] as the group of automorphisms F such that there exists [formula] satisfying [formula]. Explicitely these are automorphisms of the form where h(x1,x2) is a homogeneous polynomial of (ordinary) degree 2n.

Other types of elementary automorphisms are defined in a similar way. Thus we obtain a tame group and deduce from the discussion above that for instance

[formula]

which is the push-forward by π of the automorphisms σ2 of the previous paragraph, is not tame.
