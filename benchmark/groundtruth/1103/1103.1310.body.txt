Introduction.

Let V be a real vector space with inner product x  ·  y and norm ||x|| = (x  ·  x)1 / 2, for vectors x,y in V. Any finite sum [formula], for real numbers cj and vectors xj in V, 1  ≤  j  ≤  k, is called a linear combination of the vectors [formula]. A subset E of V is called linearly independent if for any finite subset [formula] of E and real numbers [formula] the relation [formula] implies that all cj = 0, 1  ≤  j  ≤  k. We say that E is pairwise orthogonal if x  ·  y = 0, for any two different vectors x and y in V. As is well known, any pairwise orthogonal set is also linearly independent. The converse implication is in general false. A pairwise orthogonal set of vectors of unit length is called an ortonormal set, or an ON - set for short. The linear span of a set E  ⊂  V is the set of all linear combinations [formula] of vectors xj from E and is denoted by span(E). Clearly, span(E) is a linear subspace of V. We define the angle θ between two non-zero vectors x and y in V by If x = 0 or y = 0 we define the angle θ to be zero. In the following we identify tha angle θ with its cosine p, p =  cos θ and - 1  ≤  p  ≤  1. The Gram - Schmidt Orthogonalization Algorithm produces an ortogoanal set of vectors from an linearly independent set. We state this result as follows, c.f. [\cite=S], Theorem 31, or [\cite=KKOP], [\cite=RS].

Let E = {xi} be a finite or denumerably infinite linearly independent subset of V. Then there is a set [formula] of vectors in V with the following properties:

We are going to generalize Theorem 1 in the following way. Fix any - 1 < p < 1 and a linearly independent set [formula] in V. We construct a set of vectors [formula] that spans the same subspaces as [formula] and satisfies ||zi|| = 1, zi  ·  zj = p, for 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n, i  ≠  j. It turns out that a necessary and sufficient condition for such a construction is that p(n - 1) + 1 > 0 in the n - dimensional case and p  ≥  0 in the infinite dimensional case.

Let {xi}ni = 1 be a linearly independent subset of V and let - 1 < p < 1. Then there exists a set of vectors {zi}nn = 1 such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

for all 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n, i  ≠  j, if and only if [formula].

Let {xi}∞n = 1 be a denumerably infinite and linearly independent set of vectors in V and let - 1 < p < 1. Then there exists a set {zi}∞n = 1 in V such that (4) and (5) hold for all 1  ≤  i,j, i  ≠  j, if and only if 0  ≤  p < 1.

Theorem 2 and Corollary 1 can be stated in terms of distances in stead of angles, since if ||x|| = ||y|| = 1 then ||x - y||2 = 2(1 - x  ·  y).

Let {xi}ni = 1 be a linearly independent set of vectors in V and 0 < d < 2. Then there exists vectors {zi}ni = 1 satisfying (4) and

[formula]

for 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n, i  ≠  j, if and only if [formula].

Let {xi}∞n = 1 be a denumerably infinite and linearly independent set of vectors in V and let 0 < d < 2. Then there exists a set {zi}∞n = 1 in V such that (4) and (6) hold for all 1  ≤  i < j, if and only if [formula].

Remark 1. Taking d = 1 in (6) we get an equilateral set [formula] with n + 1 points. For more on equilateral sets in normed spaces, see [\cite=SV].

Proofs

This section contains the proofs of Theorem 2 and Corollary 1 and we begin with the proof of Theorem 2. Proof of Theorem 2. Let {xi}ni = 1 be as in the theorem, let [formula] and perform the Gram-Schmidt algorithm on {xi}ni = 1. This gives vectors {yi}ni = 1 satisfying (1) and (3). We will define the vectors {zi}ni = 1 inductively and start with z1 = y1. Next let w = y2 + a  ·  z1. Then ||w||2 = 1 + a2 and w  ·  z1 = a. We take a such that w  ·  z1 = p  ·  ||w||, which gives [formula]. Finally define z2 = w / ||w||. Now assume that we have defined [formula] such that ||zi|| = 1 and zi  ·  zj = p, 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  k, i  ≠  j. Let [formula]. Then and since yk + 1 is orthogonal to [formula]. This gives for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. Subtracting the last equations pairwise gives [formula] and

[formula]

Further,

[formula]

Combining (7) and (8) gives This equation can be solved for d, since [formula] Now define zk + 1 = w / ||w||. Continuing in this way produces vectors {zi}ni = 1 satisfying (5). It is easy to see that {zi}ni = 1 is linearly independet, which proves (4). Conversely, assume that [formula] are vectors in V satisfying (4) and (5). Then [formula] is linearly independent and the formula [formula] proves that p >  - 1 / (n - 1). [formula] Proof of Corollary 1. Let {xi}∞i = 1 be as in the corollary and 0  ≤  p < 1. The proof of Theorem 2 applies and gives vectors {zi}∞i = 1 with the desired properties. Conversely, assume that {zi}∞i = 1 has properties (4) and (5) for 1  ≤  i < j. Then {zi}∞i = 1 is linearly independent and [formula], n  ≥  1. It follows that p  ≥  0 by letting n  →    ∞  . [formula]

The Gram-Schmidt p-Algorithm

In this section we describe the algorithm that produces the sequence {zi}ni = 1 in Theorem 2. Let {yi}ni = 1 be an ON - set in V and let [formula]. We define the vectors {zi}ni = 1 inductively by the method in the proof of Theorem 2. Put z1 = y1 and assume that [formula] have been defined. Then let where α and β satisfy and An easy calculation yields

[formula]

which gives the following algorithm. The Gram-Schmidt p-Algorithm (GSp). The input is a linearly independent set [formula] in a real inner product space V. The output is a set [formula] of vectors with the properties (4) and (5) in Theorem 2. Step 0. Perform the Gram-Schmidt Algorithm in Theorem 1 and get an ON -  set [formula]. Step 1. Define z1 = y1. Step 2. After vectors [formula] have been constructed, we define

[formula]

Step 3. The set [formula] that is constructed after Step 2 has been performed (n - 1) times has the desired properties. [formula] Formula (10) will allow us to get explicit expressions for each zk. We start with the following lemma.

Let {yk}n1 be an ON-set in V and let {zk}n1 be defined by (GSp). Then there are numbers zk(i), 1  ≤  i  ≤  k and 1  ≤  k  ≤  n, such that where zk + 1(i) = zk(i), for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1 and 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1.

Proof. The case k = 2 follows from an explicit calculation. Assume that the lemma holds for some fixed 2  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1 and all 1  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1 Then for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k by (10) and from which the lemma follows. [formula] We can now give explicit formulas for zk, 1  ≤  k  ≤  n. Define

[formula]

m=1,2, . Then we get the following result.

Let {yk}n1 be an ON-set in V and let {zk}n1 be defined by (GSp). Then z1 = y1 and zk is given by

[formula]

for 2  ≤  k  ≤  n.

Proof. The case k = 2 follows by calculation. Assume that the theorem holds for some 2  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1 and consider zk + 1. We note that zk + 1(i), 1  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1, and zk + 1(k + 1) are correct by Lemma 1 and (10). Finally, by (10) and (11), which completes the proof of the theorem [formula]

Asymptotics.

The final section of this paper is about the infinite dimensional case. Let V be the standard real vector space l2 of points [formula] with finite norm [formula] and inner product [formula] Let {yi}∞1 be a denumerably infinite ON-set in V, 0 < p < 1, and let {zk}∞1 be the vectors obtained from Theorem 4 by identifying the finite dimensional space V as a subspace of l2 in a natural way. Then

[formula]

for 1  ≤  k < m, in analogy with Theorems 2 and 3. Define a vector z0 by It is easy to see that z0 is in V and in fact that [formula] by a telescoping argument. We can now use z0 to get the following asymptotic formula for zk, as k  →    ∞  .

Let {zk}∞1 be as above, then [formula] as k  →    ∞  , in the sense that

Proof. Clearly, [formula] is at most We get by a telescoping series and by an elementary calculation. The theorem follows easily. [formula] Remark 2. The set {zi}∞1 in (13) is an infinite equilateral set in V for p = 1 / 2. Historical remark. Jø rgen Pedersen Gram, 1850 - 1916, was a danish mathematician working in booth pure and applied mathematics. The german mathematician Erhard Schmidt, 1876 - 1959, is considered as one of the fathers of modern abstract functional analysis. The Gram-Schmidt algorithm was however presented before both Gram and Schmidt by the famous french mathematician Pierre - Simon Laplace, 1749 - 1827.
