Abstract. Some Wiener-Hopf determinants on

[formula]

Introduction

Let σ(x) be an integrable function on the real line and

[formula]

The Wiener-Hopf operator on L2(0,2s) corresponding to the symbol σ(ξ) is defined by its kernel K(x) as follows:

[formula]

If I - W(σ) is of trace class there exists the determinant (see, e.g., [\cite=BoSi]):

[formula]

As is well known, Wiener-Hopf determinants det W are continuous analogues of the determinants of Toeplitz matrices. Let f(θ) be an integrable function on the unit circle. Define the (n + 1)  ×  (n + 1) Toeplitz matrix Tn(f) by its elements as

[formula]

We denote the associated Toeplitz determinant by

[formula]

There are many examples of Toeplitz determinants for which an explicit expression for all n can be given. One reason for this is a simple relation between Toeplitz matrices and orthogonal polynomials (see below). The situation in the Wiener-Hopf case is more complicated. In the present paper we calculate some Wiener-Hopf determinants whose symbols are zero on an interval. Note that the known variants of the strong Szeg o limit theorem, which gives large s asymptotics of Wiener-Hopf determinants (see [\cite=BoSi] [\cite=BW] [\cite=BWfh]), are not valid in this case. The asymptotics of our Wiener-Hopf determinants have the factor e- s2 / 2 in them, and in that, resemble the asymptotics of Toeplitz determinants with symbols f(θ) on circular arcs found by Widom [\cite=WidomArc]. This reflects the fact that, in both cases, the symbols are zero on intervals (on ( - α,α), 0 < α  <  π, for f(θ) [\cite=WidomArc], and on ( - 1,1) for σ(ξ) in our examples).

Similar asymptotics were known for the kernel K0(x) =  sin x / πx. The corresponding Wiener-Hopf determinant det W0 = |δ(x - y) - K0(x - y)|2s0 gives the probability in the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble for an interval of length 2s (in the bulk scaling limit) to be free from eigenvalues (see [\cite=Mehta]). The large s asymptotics for it is as follows [\cite=dCM] [\cite=Dyson] [\cite=WidomAs] [\cite=DIZ]:

[formula]

where ζ'(x) is the derivative of Riemann's zeta function. Note that appearance of the constant 21 / 12e3ζ'( - 1) has not yet been rigorously justified.

To get our results, we use the following observations:

1) Some Wiener-Hopf determinants can be obtained as the n  →    ∞   limit of Toeplitz ones Dn(f) if f(θ) is allowed to depend on n [\cite=Dyson] [\cite=BW]. For example, if f(θ) = f0(θ) = 1 on the arc α  ≤  θ  ≤  2π  -  α, α = 2s / n, and otherwise f0(θ) = 0, we have lim n  →    ∞Dn(f0) =  det W0.

2) Dn(f) can be easily obtained given the polynomials Φn(eiθ) orthogonal on the unit circle with the weight function f(θ) (see [\cite=Szego] and Lemma 3.1).

3) Suppose f(θ) is symmetric (f(θ) = f(2π  -  θ)). Then, by the formulas of Szeg o, f(θ) and the polynomials Φn(eiθ) are related to a weight function w(x) on the interval

[formula]

are not explicitly known.

On the other hand, many systems of orthogonal polynomials on an interval have been extensively investigated. Thus, taking various w(x) for which the associated polynomials are known, we can hope to obtain the corresponding Wiener-Hopf determinants. However, for most known weight functions w(x) the limit lim n  →    ∞Dn(f) does not have proper convergence. So it is only in very special cases that we get Wiener-Hopf determinants. Those we calculate correspond to

[formula]

In this case the polynomials can be explicitly written in terms of Bernstein-Szeg o polynomials. The corresponding function f(θ) is asymptotically (n  →    ∞  ) 1 on the unit circle except for a small (of order 1 / n) neighbourhood of θ = 0 (cf f0(θ)). Our main result is

Theorem 1.1 (Bernstein-Szeg o Fredholm determinant.) Let the kernel

[formula]

Then

[formula]

For r  ≠  0 the kernel can be rewritten as

[formula]

and, furthermore, for r = 1, as

[formula]

where J1(t) is the 1st order Bessel function.

Remark. As is easy to verify, the symbol

[formula]

Should we wish to generalize this theorem, we could consider the weights obtained by multiplying ([\ref=wx]) with factors of the form (1 - x2 + ax2 / n2) / (1 - x2 + bx2 / n2). The corresponding polynomials can be reconstructed from the Bernstein-Szeg o polynomials using the Christoffel formula ([\cite=Szego], Theorem 2.5).

We also consider the polynomials orthogonal on the arc α  ≤  θ  ≤  2π  -  α of the unit circle with the weights f1(θ) =  sin θ / 2, f2(θ) =  sin - 1θ / 2 (Lemma 2.2). They are related to the Legendre polynomials. Note that the polynomials associated with the weight sin θ / 2 were discussed in [\cite=GN] where their reflection coefficients were found. For a review of polynomials orthogonal on an arc of the unit circle, see [\cite=GAkh] [\cite=GN] [\cite=BL] [\cite=RL] and references therein. The determinants Dn(f1) and Dn(f2) are given by Lemma 4.1.

Polynomials on an arc

Let w(x) be a symmetric (w(x) = w( - x)) weight function on the interval

[formula]

(z-1)Φ(z)= (2γ) z( zP(x)-1-a 2γP(x)).

[formula]

Φ(z)= (2γ) z( Q(x)-1+a 2γzQ(x)).

[formula]

Wiener-Hopf determinants

Consider again monic orthogonal polynomials satisfying relation ([\ref=phi]). A simple but very important fact about the Toeplitz determinant Dn(f) is that (see, e.g., [\cite=Szego], p.286)

[formula]

Using this we immediately obtain from Lemma 2.1 the following statement:

Lemma 3.1 Let the quantities f(θ), γ, Pk(x), Qk(x), hk, h'k, tk be the same as in Lemma 2.1. Then

[formula]

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 1.1. We begin with a particular case of r = 0:

Theorem 3.2 (Chebyshev Fredholm determinant.) Let the kernel

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Proof. Consider the weight function

[formula]

The corresponding monic orthogonal polynomials Pk(x) are the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind:

[formula]

Lemma 2.1 gives us now the polynomials Φk(z) orthogonal on the arc α  ≤  θ  ≤  2π  -  α with the weight function

[formula]

Consider Dn(f) for α = 2s / n, s > 0 and large n. In this case γ  =   cos α  /  2 = 1 - s2 / (2n2) + O(n- 4) and ([\ref=f1]) takes the form

[formula]

As  arccos  γ- 1 = is / n + O(n- 3), we also have Pn(γ- 1) = ( cosh s + O(n- 2)) / 2n - 1.

The formula ([\ref=D]) gives

[formula]

Thus Dn(f) tends to a finite limit as n  →    ∞  . This indicates existence of the Fredholm determinant lim n  →    ∞Dn(f). Let us therefore consider the behaviour of the matrix elements of Tn(f) as n  →    ∞  , that is of

[formula]

where f(θ) is given by ([\ref=f11]). We now split the last integral into a sum of two: one Ik1, over a small neighbourhood (α,α  +  ε) of α, the other Ik2, over the interval (α  +  ε,π). In the first integral we change the variables θ = 2xs / n:

[formula]

Here we added and subtracted cos under the sign of the integral. It ensures that we can replace the upper integration limit in the first integral of the last sum by infinity introducing by doing so the error of order 1 / (n2ε). After that we change the variable x =  cosh t in the first integral and integrate the second one to get:

[formula]

where for k = 0 expressions sin ak / k should be replaced by a. As for Ik2, we have

[formula]

Taking, e.g., ε = 1 / n2 / 5, we finally obtain

[formula]

uniformly in k. Thus, as a simple analysis shows, lim n  →    ∞Dn(f) = |δ(x - y) - KC(x - y)|2s0, where KC(z) is given by ([\ref=Kc]). In view of equation ([\ref=Dc]), we completed the proof. [formula]

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Take the weight function

[formula]

The corresponding orthogonal polynomials are a particular case of the Bernstein-Szeg o polynomials ([\cite=Szego], Theorem 2.6). They are given by the expressions:

[formula]

where [formula]. The polynomials [formula] are orthonormal, that is [formula]. Therefore the monic polynomials and constants hk are given by the formulas:

[formula]

where κk are the coefficients of the highest degree of [formula]. Collecting the coefficients of xk in ([\ref=BS]), we obtain:

[formula]

The weight function of the corresponding polynomials Φk(z) on the arc α  ≤  θ  ≤  2π  -  α

[formula]

Note that the functions for r = 0 and r = 1 are inverses of each other. Just as in the previous proof, we consider Dn(f) for α = 2s / n, s > 0 and large n. Since a = 1 / 2 - rs / (2n) + O(n- 3) we obtain

[formula]

Substituting this into ([\ref=D]) gives

[formula]

For the elements of the Toeplitz matrix Tn(f) we now have:

[formula]

This integral can be estimated in the same way as the one in the previous proof. We then obtain the result of the theorem with

[formula]

If r  ≠  0, we can use the following formula in the analysis of ([\ref=2I]):

[formula]

(integration by parts). In this case we get expression ([\ref=K2]) for the kernel. For r = 1 it takes the form

[formula]

Recalling the integral representation of Bessel functions, we see that

[formula]

Multiply this relation by z and integrate from zero to z. We integrate the l.h.s. by parts, and for the r.h.s. use the result [formula]. This leads to the following equation:

[formula]

Its solution satisfying the condition KBS(  ∞  ) = 0 (see ([\ref=Kb2])) gives:

[formula]

Since by ([\ref=Kb2]) KBS(1,z) = KBS(1, - z) this completes the proof. [formula]

Second proof for r = 1. In this case, let us write the weight function ([\ref=w2]) in the form

[formula]

We see that the polynomials Qk(x) are the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind. We have

[formula]

In the variable ψ, the quantity tn defined by ([\ref=phiQ]) has the form

[formula]

The asymptotics of this integral as α = 2s / n (γ  =   cos (α / 2)) and n  →    ∞   are analyzed similarly to those of ([\ref=Ik]) in the proof of Theorem 3.2. The main contribution to the integral comes from the small neighbourhoods of the points zero and π. The result is

[formula]

Representing the product of cosine and sine functions as a sum of two sines and changing the variables [formula], we finally obtain

[formula]

Substituting this and h'k ([\ref=h']) into ([\ref=D2]), we obtain ([\ref=Db]) for r = 1. The rest of the argument is the same as in the first proof. [formula]

Toeplitz determinants for [formula] on an arc

Lemma 4.1 Let f1(θ) =  sin θ / 2, f2(θ) =  sin - 1θ / 2 if α  ≤  θ  ≤  2π  -  α, and f1(θ) = f2(θ) = 0 otherwise. Then for α = 2s / n, large n, we have

[formula]

where ζ'(x) is the derivative of Riemann's zeta function, and J0(x) is the 0th order Bessel function.

Proof. Combining Lemmas 2.2. and 3.1 ([\ref=D]), we obtain:

[formula]

Here γ(n) =  cos (s / n). For the Legendre polynomial we use the well-known Hilb asymptotics which is uniform in s / n:

[formula]

The asymptotics of An are easy to compute (see [\cite=WidomArc]):

[formula]

Substituting these results into ([\ref=Dprim]) gives the first asymptotics in the lemma.

The determinant Dn(f2) is obtained by using the second part of Lemma 2.2. and ([\ref=D2]) of Lemma 3.1.:

[formula]

and to get its asymptotics, it only remains to calculate tn, n  →    ∞  . Exactly as ([\ref=tas]) we have

[formula]

Now we use Hilb's asymptotics for Ln( cos (ψ)) and estimate the integral in the same way as ([\ref=tas]). We get

[formula]

which, in view of ([\ref=D2prim]), completes the proof.[formula]
