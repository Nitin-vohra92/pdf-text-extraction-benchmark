The Magnetism of Neutron States

Based on the invited talk at the NATO Advanced Study Institute, 2003 at KEMER

Very recently Bignami and co-workers have been able to observe the magnetic field of an isolated neutron star for the first time1 and get the value 8  ×  1010 Gauss, which differs by a few orders of magnitude from the expected value2. We would like to draw attention to the fact that infact the value just observed was deduced on the basis of the anomalous statistics obeyed by the neutrons in neutron stars, which behave as a degenerate Fermi gas3,4,5. The anomalous statistics arises due to the fact that, as is well known, the energy density e at sub Fermi temperatures is given by

[formula]

where pF and TF are respectively the Fermi momentum and Fermi temperature. Comparing ([\ref=e1]) with the well known generalization of the Stefan-Boltzmann Law6,7, viz.,

[formula]

we can see that the assembly of neutrons behaves with the fractal dimensionality 1.5, leading to the anomalous semionic statistics. On the other hand if we consider an assembly of N spin half particles, it is known that N+ denoting the number of spin up particles, the magnetization per unit volume is given by

[formula]

where μ is the electron magnetic moment. The point is that at low temperatures with usual dimensionality, there are as many spin up as spin down particles so that [formula]. Equation ([\ref=e2]) then shows that the magnetization is negligible. On the other hand if the assembly behaved according to Bose-Einstein statistics, then there would be a large magnetization because all particles would align with their spins, that is effectively N+  ≈  N. When we have the anomalous statistics due to the fractional dimensionality, then we would have instead

[formula]

Equations ([\ref=e2]) and ([\ref=e3]) are quite general - they hold for Fermi gases at sub Fermi temperatures. Infact, in a completely different context, for the earth core, they give the correct geomagnetic field4,8. In this case the Fermi temperature can be easily calculated to be 105 degrees centigrade, well above the core temperature. Further there are N  ≈  1048 atoms (mostly iron) in the inner core and we get on using ([\ref=e2]) and ([\ref=e3]) the correct geomagnetic strength of about 1 Gauss. Let us consider the magnetic field of Jupiter. Remembering that the core density of Jupiter is of the same order as that of the earth, while the core volume is about 104 times that of the earth, we have N  ~  1052, so that the magnetism MV, from ([\ref=e2]) ~  104 times the earth's magnetism, as required. In the case of neutron stars we know that the number density [formula] particles per cc9. Moreover the assembly of neutrons is known to be below the Fermi temperature. Whence using ([\ref=e3]) in ([\ref=e2]), we get the magnetization ≈  1011 Gauss, exactly as observed by Bignami and co-workers, who infact believe that there is indeed exotic behaviour of the matter in neutron stars. 1.

In 1.5 dimensions we have, with the usual notation, μ being a multiplicative factor,

[formula]

If we compare ([\ref=eA1]) with the usual expression viz.,

[formula]

we can see the denominator of the integral in ([\ref=eA1]) is much larger that that in ([\ref=eA2]), that is the contribution of momentum states in

[formula]

is negligible compared to the contribution of momentum states in

[formula]

Effectively there is a mono energetic collection of Fermions which has been shown to have anomalous Bosonic behaviour (i.e. the occupied states are comparatively crowded). To appreciate this further, we have for two dimensions from an equation like ([\ref=eA1])

[formula]

μ', being again a constant factor. Thus ([\ref=eA3]) shows that z is small, corresponding to a low density classical type behaviour, rather than the degenerate Fermi gas Quantum behaviour near Fermi temperatures.
