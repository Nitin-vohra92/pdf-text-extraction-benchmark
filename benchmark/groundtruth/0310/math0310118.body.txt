Manifolds which are Ivanov-Petrova or k-Stanilov

Introduction

In considering the spectral geometry of the Riemann curvature tensor, one studies when a certain natural operator associated to the curvature has constant Jordan normal form on the natural domain of definition. In this brief note, we consider two such operators - the skew-symmetric curvature operator R and a higher order generalization Θ. We begin by recalling some basic definitions.

The algebraic context

Let V: = (V,g,R) be a model space where V is a finite dimensional real vector space which is equipped with a non-degenerate inner product g of signature (p,q), and where R is an algebraic curvature tensor on V, i.e. [formula] satisfies the usual curvature symmetries:

[formula]

Let R(x,y) be the associated curvature operator; it is characterized by the identity:

[formula]

Let [formula] (resp. [formula]) be the Grassmannians of oriented (resp. unoriented) spacelike (+  ) and timelike (-  ) k-planes in V. Let {e1,e2} be an oriented orthonormal basis for [formula]. The skew-symmetric curvature operator

[formula]

was introduced by Stanilov in 1990 - see the discussion in Ivanova and Stanilov [\cite=refRIGS]; it is independent of the particular oriented orthonormal basis chosen for π. One says V has constant spacelike (resp. timelike) rank r if [formula] for any oriented spacelike (resp. timelike) 2 plane π of V. One says V is spacelike (resp. timelike) Jordan Ivanov-Petrova if the Jordan normal form of R is constant on [formula]. Clearly if V is spacelike (resp. timelike) Jordan Ivanov-Petrova, then V has constant spacelike (resp. timelike) rank.

There is a higher order analogue which was introduced Stanilov [\cite=Stx] [\cite=Sty]. If {e1,...,ek} is an orthonormal basis for [formula], then the higher order curvature operator is defined by setting:

[formula]

This self-adjoint operator is, similarly, independent of the particular orthonormal basis chosen for π. One says V is k - spacelike (resp. k-timelike) Jordan Stanilov if the Jordan normal form of Θ is constant on [formula]; see also [\cite=TzVi99] for further details. Up to a suitable normalizing factor,

[formula]

so the higher order curvature operator can be regarded as an average of the square skew-symmetric curvature operator. It is necessary to square R to obtain a non-zero average since R(  ·  ) changes sign if the orientation of π is reversed.

Note that one could in fact define R (resp. Θ) for any non-degenerate oriented 2 plane (resp. non-degenerate unoriented k plane); we shall restrict ourselves to the spacelike and the timelike planes in the interests of simplicity.

The geometric context

Let (M,g) be a pseudo-Riemannian manifold of signature (p,q) and dimension m = p + q. Let R be the Riemann curvature of the Levi-Civita connection. We say that (M,g) is spacelike (resp. timelike) Jordan Ivanov-Petrova if TP: = (TPM,gP,RP) is spacelike (resp. timelike) Jordan Ivanov-Petrova for every point P of M. Similarly, we say that (M,g) is k-spacelike (resp. k-timelike) Jordan Stanilov if TP is k-spacelike (resp. k-timelike) Jordan Stanilov for every point P of M. In both contexts, note that the Jordan normal form is allowed to vary with the point in question.

In the Riemannian setting (p = 0), the Jordan normal form is determined by the eigenvalue structure and, as every k plane is spacelike, we shall drop the qualifiers 'spacelike' and 'Jordan'. This is not true in the higher signature context which is why we focus on the Jordan normal form, i.e. the conjugacy class, instead of only on the eigenvalue structure.

Ivanov-Petrova tensors and manifolds

One has the following result, which is due to Gilkey, Leahy, and Sadofsky [\cite=refGLS] and Gilkey [\cite=refGi99] in the Riemannian setting (p = 0), which was generalized by Zhang [\cite=Za00] [\cite=Za02] to the Lorentzian (p = 1) setting, and which was extended by Stavrov [\cite=St03] to the higher signature setting:

Let V be a model space with constant spacelike rank r.

If p = 0 and if q  ≠  3,4,7, then r = 2.

If [formula], if 1  ≤  p  ≤  (q - 6) / 4, and if the set {q,q + 1,...,q + p} does not contain a power of 2, then r = 2.

This result is important as one has the following classification result [\cite=refGLS] [\cite=GiZa02a]. Let gV be a metric on a finite dimensional real vector space V. If φ is a self-adjoint linear map of V, then we define an algebraic curvature tensor Rφ on V by setting:

[formula]

Let [formula]. The following assertions are equivalent:

The model space V is spacelike rank 2 Jordan Ivanov-Petrova.

There exists [formula] and a self-adjoint map φ of V so R = cRφ where one of the following 3 conditions on φ holds:

φ is an isometry of (V,g), i.e. [formula].

φ is a para-isometry of (V,g), i.e. [formula].

φ2 = 0 and ker φ contains no spacelike vectors.

In the metric setting, one has [\cite=refGLS] [\cite=GiZa02b] [\cite=IvPe]:

Let (M,g) be a connected spacelike Jordan Ivanov-Petrova pseudo-Riemannian manifold of signature (p,q). Assume either (p,q) = (0,4) or that [formula]. Assume that R(π) is not nilpotent for at least one spacelike 2 plane in TM and that TP has spacelike rank 2 for all P∈M. Let R = cRφ be as in Theorem [\ref=thm-1.2] where φ  =  φ(P). Then φ is an isometry, [formula], and one of the following 2 cases holds:

[formula] and (M,g) has constant sectional curvature.

(M,g) = (I  ×  N,εdt2 + f(t)ds2N) where (I,dt2) is an open interval in [formula], where (N,ds2N) has constant sectional curvature K, where [formula], and where the warping function f(t): = εKt2 + At + B for [formula].

Theorems [\ref=thm-1.1], [\ref=thm-1.2], and [\ref=thm-1.3] complete the classification of Ivanov-Petrova manifolds in the Riemannian setting for m  ≠  3,4,7; the work of Ivanov and Petrova [\cite=IvPe] uses entirely different methods and shows that Theorem [\ref=thm-1.3] holds if m = 4. The case m = 3 is exceptional and the case m = 7 is open.

In Section [\ref=Sect-2], we will use Theorem [\ref=thm-1.3] to establish the following result:

Let (M,g) be a connected spacelike Jordan Ivanov-Petrova pseudo-Riemannian manifold of signature (p,q). Assume either that (p,q) = (0,4) or that [formula]. Assume that R(π) is not nilpotent for at least one spacelike 2 plane in TM and that TP has spacelike rank 2 for all P∈M. Then

(M,g) is k-spacelike Jordan Stanilov for any 2  ≤  k  ≤  q.

(M,g) is k-timelike Jordan Stanilov for any 2  ≤  k  ≤  p.

We will also establish the following partial converse in the Riemannian setting.

Let (M,g) be a connected Riemannian manifold of dimension m where m  ≠  3,7. If (M,g) is 2-Stanilov, then (M,g) is Ivanov-Petrova with constant spacelike rank 2.

Theorem [\ref=thm-1.5] is false in the higher signature context. In Section [\ref=Sect-3] we will discuss a family of manifolds that arise as hypersurfaces in flat space. Let [formula] and let [formula] be coordinates on [formula] where [formula] and [formula]. Let [formula] be a smooth function on a connected open subset [formula]. Let H = (Hij) be the Hessian where Hij: = ∂xi∂xjf. We define a metric gf on [formula] of neutral signature (p,p) by setting:

[formula]

We will establish the following result in Section [\ref=Sect-3]; these manifolds were first introduced in [\cite=GIZ03].

Assume [formula]. Then (Mf,gf) is:

spacelike Jordan Ivanov-Petrova if and only if det (H) is never zero.

timelike Jordan Ivanov-Petrova if and only if det (H) is never zero.

k-spacelike and k-timelike Jordan Stanilov for 2  ≤  k  ≤  p for any f.

Let [formula]. In Section [\ref=Sect-4], we exhibit family of manifolds of signature (2s,s) which are spacelike Jordan Ivanov-Petrova but not timelike Jordan Ivanov-Petrova. Thus the notions spacelike and timelike are distinct. This family provides the first example of spacelike Ivanov-Petrova manifolds of spacelike rank 4. The manifolds will be k-spacelike Jordan Stanilov for all admissible k; they will be k-timelike Jordan Stanilov only for k = 2s.

Let [formula] be coordinates on [formula] where [formula], [formula], and [formula]. We define a metric of signature (2s,s) on [formula] by setting:

[formula]

One says that (M,g) is curvature homogeneous if there exists a model V and isomorphisms ψP:TP  →  V for all P∈M; see [\cite=KTV91] [\cite=KTV92] for further details. These manifolds were first introduced in [\cite=GiNi03] [\cite=GiNi03b] to provide examples of curvature homogeneous spacelike Osserman manifolds which are not locally homogeneous and where the Jacobi operator was nilpotent of order 3.

The manifolds (M3s,g3s) are

Spacelike rank 4 Jordan Ivanov-Petrova.

Not timelike Jordan Ivanov-Petrova.

k-Spacelike Jordan Stanilov for 2  ≤  k  ≤  s.

k-Timelike Jordan Stanilov if and only if k = 2s.

Here is a brief guide to this paper. In Section [\ref=Sect-2], we establish Theorems [\ref=thm-1.4] and [\ref=thm-1.5]. In Section [\ref=Sect-3], we review results of [\cite=GIZ03] to sketch the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-1.6]. Section [\ref=Sect-4] comprises the body of this paper. We first determine the curvature tensor of the metric in question. Then we show the space is curvature homogeneous and determine the model space. We complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-1.7] by establishing the corresponding assertions for the model space.

Relationships between the Stanilov and Ivanov-Petrova condition

Let (M,g) be a connected spacelike Jordan Ivanov-Petrova pseudo-Riemannian manifold of signature (p,q) where [formula] or where (p,q) = (0,4). Assume that R(π) is not nilpotent for at least one spacelike 2 plane in TM and that TP has spacelike rank 2 for all P∈M. We may then use Theorem [\ref=thm-1.3] to see R = cRφ where [formula] and φ is an isometry. If {e1,e2} is an orthonormal basis for an oriented spacelike 2 plane π, then R(e1,e2)x = c{g(φe2,x)φe1 - g(φe1,x)φe2}. Let [formula]. Then

[formula]

Let ρπ be orthogonal projection on π. By Display ([\ref=eqn-2.x]),

[formula]

If [formula], then we can use Equation ([\ref=eqn-2.y]) to obtain

[formula]

This shows Θ(πk) has constant Jordan normal form and hence (M,g) is k-spacelike Jordan Stanilov. The argument that (M,g) is k-timelike Jordan Stanilov is essentially the same modulo an appropriate change of signs and thus is omitted.

Let (M,g) be a Riemannian manifold which is 2-Stanilov. Let {λi(π)} be the eigenvalues of R(π) for [formula]. Then {λ2i(π)} are the eigenvalues of Θ(π). Since these eigenvalues are independent of π, since [formula] is connected, and since the eigenvalues vary continously, we may conclude that R(π) also has constant eigenvalues. Since the Jordan normal form is determined by the eigenvalue structure in the postive definite setting, we can conclude that (M,g) is Ivanov-Petrova.

Stanilov manifolds of neutral signature (p,p)

The following manifolds were first introduced in [\cite=GIZ03] and we follow the discussion there to see the metric gf of Equation ([\ref=eqn-1.a]) is a hypersurface metric. Let {U1,...,Up,V1,...,Vp,W} be a basis for [formula] where [formula]. Introduce a non-degenerate inner product 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 on [formula] by defining:

[formula]

Introduce coordinates [formula] on [formula] where [formula] and [formula]. Let [formula] be a smooth real valued function on [formula]. Define an embedding of [formula] in [formula] by setting

[formula]

Let gf be the induced hypersurface pseudo-Riemannian metric on Mf;

[formula]

Let Hij: = ∂xi∂xjf be the Hessian, let L be the second fundamental form, and let S be the shape operator:

[formula]

We then have

[formula]

Let [formula]; by assumption [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula]. If Z1 and Z2 are arbitrary tangent vectors, then we may use Displays ([\ref=eqn-3.a]) and ([\ref=eqn-3.b]) to see that

[formula]

Consequently R(Z1,Z2)2 = 0 and thus Θ(π) = 0 for any spacelike or timelike k plane π. Thus, trivially, (Mf,gf) is k-spacelike and k-timelike Jordan Stanilov for any admissible k.

Since R(π)2 = 0 for any oriented spacelike (resp. timelike) 2-plane, the Jordan normal form of R(π) is determined by [formula]. Let {Z1,Z2} be an orthonormal basis for π. Expand Zμ = Xμ + Yμ for Xμ∈X and Yμ∈Y. Then R(π) = R(X1,X2) as well. Note that [formula]. Since π is spacelike (resp. timelike), X1 and X2 are linearly independent. We have

[formula]

If [formula], then {S(X1),S(X2)} is a linearly independent set and thus [formula]; consequently (Mf,gf) is spacelike (resp. timelike) Jordan Ivanov-Petrova. On the other hand, if [formula], then we may choose spacelike (resp. timelike) 2 planes π1 and π2 so [formula] and [formula] and thus (Mf,gf) is not spacelike (resp. timelike) Jordan Ivanov-Petrova.

k-Stanilov manifolds in signature (2s,s)

The curvature tensor of the manifolds (M3s,g3s)

We adopt the notation of Display ([\ref=eqn-1.b]). We begin our study of the manifold (M3s,g3s) by showing:

Let R3s be the curvature tensor of the pseudo-Riemannian manifold (M3s,g3s) defined in Display ([\ref=eqn-1.b]). Then the non-zero entries in R3s are, up to the usual [formula] symmetries of Equation ([\ref=eqn-1.xx]), given by:

[formula]

Let i  ≠  j. The non-zero Christoffel symbols of the second kind are given by:

[formula]

We may then raise indices to see the non-zero covariant derivatives are given by:

[formula]

We have [formula]. Thus if at least one zμ∈{∂vi}, R3s(z1,z2,z3,z4) = 0. Similarly, if at least two of the zμ belong to {∂ti}, then R3s(z1,z2,z3,z4) = 0. Furthermore [formula] if the indices {i,j,k} are distinct. Finally,

[formula]

The Lemma now follows.

Let {U1,...,Us,T1,...,Ts,V1,...,Vs} be a basis for [formula] where [formula]. Let [formula] where the non-zero entries of the metric g3s and of the algebraic curvature tensor R3s, up to the usual [formula] symmetries, are

[formula]

Set [formula]. Then [formula] is a maximal spacelike subspace of [formula] and [formula] is the complementary maximal timelike subspace. Thus [formula] has signature (2s,s). A basis B  =  {Ũ1,...,Ũs,T̃1,...,T̃s,ṽ1,...,ṽs} for [formula] is said to be normalized if the relations given above in Display ([\ref=eqn-4.a]) hold for B.

(M3s,g3s) is curvature homogeneous with model space V3s.

Fix P∈M3s. Let constants εi and ϱi be given. We define a new basis for TPM by setting:

[formula]

Let i  ≠  j. Since g3s(Ui,Ti) = εi  -  εi = 0, the possibly non-zero entries of g3s and R3s are, up to the usual [formula] symmetries, given by

[formula]

We set

[formula]

This ensures that g3s(Ui,Ui) = 0 and R3s(Ui,Uj,Uj,Ui) = 0 and establishes the existence of a basis with the normalizations of Definition [\ref=defn-4.2].

Lemma [\ref=lem-4.3] shows that the manifold (M3s,g3s) is curvature homogeneous; the work of [\cite=GiNi03b] shows it is not locally homogeneous. We shall prove Theorem [\ref=thm-1.7] by establishing the corresponding assertions for the model space V3s.

The skew-symmetric curvature operator

Theorem [\ref=thm-1.7] (1,2) will follow from the following result concerning the model space V3s.

Let R3s be the skew-symmetric curvature operator defined by R3s.

If π is an oriented spacelike 2 plane, then [formula], [formula], and R3s(π)3 = 0.

The model space V3s is spacelike rank 4 Jordan Ivanov-Petrova.

The model space V3s is not timelike Jordan Ivanov-Petrova.

There is an additional useful symmetry which plays a crucial role. Let

[formula]

be the standard orthogonal group of s  ×  s real matrices. Define a diagonal action of O(s) on [formula] which preserves the structures g3s and R3s by setting:

[formula]

Let π be an oriented spacelike 2 plane. By applying a symmetry of the form given in Equation ([\ref=eqn-4.b]), we may suppose that [formula] where

[formula]

Let c: = g3s(X1,X1)g3s(X2,X2) - g3s(X1,X2)2 > 0 and let Ξ: = R3s(X1,X2). We then have [formula]. Let [formula]. There exist real numbers εij  =  εij(b,c) and ϱij  =  ρij(b,c), which play no role in the subsequent development, so that

[formula]

Assertion (1) now follows; Assertion (2) follows from Assertion (1). Let

[formula]

be timelike 2 planes with R3s(π1) = 0 and [formula]. Assertion (3) follows.

The higher order curvature operator of V3s

Define a positive semi-definite bilinear form [formula] on [formula] by setting

[formula]

This inner product is invariant under the action of O(s) described in Equation ([\ref=eqn-4.b]). If π is a linear subspace of [formula], set

[formula]

We complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-1.7] by showing:

Let Θ3s be the higher order curvature operator defined by V3s.

If π is a spacelike k-plane, then [formula] and Θ3s(π)2 = 0.

If 2  ≤  k  ≤  s, then V3s is k-spacelike Jordan Stanilov.

Let π be a timelike 2s plane. If [formula], then [formula] and Θ3s(π)2 = 0. If [formula], then Θ3s(π) = 0.

V3s is k-timelike Jordan Stanilov if and only if k = 2s.

Fix 2  ≤  k  ≤  s. Let indices α and β range from 1 through k. Let π be a spacelike k-plane in [formula]. We diagonalize the quadratic form |π with respect to the positive definite quadratic form g|π to choose an orthonormal basis {Xα} for π so (Xα,Xβ) = aαaβδα,β where aα > 0. By replacing π by ξ  ·  π for an appropriately chosen symmetry ξ in O(s), we may assume without loss of generality that

[formula]

where the real numbers bαi and cαi play no role in the subsequent discussion. Let α  ≠  β. Let 1  ≤  i  ≤  s. We use Equation ([\ref=eqn-4.c]) to see that:

[formula]

Since [formula],

[formula]

Assertion (1) now follows; Assertion (2) follows from Assertion (1).

Suppose that π is a timelike 2s plane. We apply exactly the same diagonalization argument to see that, after replacing π by ξ  ·  π for suitably chosen ξ∈O(s), we may assume without loss of generality there exists an orthonormal basis for π so

[formula]

where ai > 0 for [formula]. We then have

[formula]

Since Θ3s(π)2 = 0 for any π, the Jordan normal form is determined by [formula]. The argument given above shows

[formula]

Assertion (3) follows.

We use Assertion (3) to see that V3s is 2s Jordan Stanilov. If 2  ≤  k  ≤  2s - 1, then set:

[formula]

Then

[formula]

This shows V3s is not k-timelike Jordan Stanilov.

Remark:

One can generalize the pseudo-Riemannian manifold (M3s,g3s) as follows. Let [formula], [formula], and [formula] give coordinates [formula] on [formula] for [formula]. Let [formula] be a smooth function on an open subset [formula]. Define a pseudo-Riemannian metric gF of signature (2s,s) on [formula] whose non-zero components are given by:

[formula]

It was shown in [\cite=GiNi03b] that these spaces are curvature homogeneous with model space V3s and thus arguments given above show that the conclusions of Theorem [\ref=thm-1.7] apply to all of the manifolds in this family. These manifolds are not locally homogeneous for generic members of the family.
