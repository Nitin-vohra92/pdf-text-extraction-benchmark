Galaxy Disruption Caught in the Act

1. Introduction Recently a number of spectacular streams of low surface brightness material have been observed in galaxy clusters - evidence that galaxy disruption is an ongoing and important process in galaxy evolution. Material torn from galaxies is dispersed into the intra-cluster medium, contributing up to 10-20% of the cluster luminosity.

A small sample of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies were discovered during an all-object Fornax Cluster Spectroscopic Survey (FCSS) using the Anglo-Australian Telescope 2dF spectrograph (Drinkwater et al. 1999, ApJ, 511, L97). These old stellar systems are 10 times more luminous than the brightest globular clusters associated with the central Fornax Cluster galaxy NGC 1399, with intrinsic sizes of ~  100 pc and B-band magnitudes ranging from -13 to -11 (Karick et al. 2003, MNRAS, 344, 188). Truly intergalactic, they are not associated with any bright cluster galaxy. Our most favoured hypothesis for their origin is that they are the remnant nuclei of infalling nucleated dwarf elliptical (dE,Ns) galaxies which have been tidally "threshed" by large galaxies or by the cluster tidal field (Bekki et al 2001, ApJ, 552, L105).

2. Evidence for Galaxy Disruption The internal velocity dispersions of the Fornax Cluster UCDs were measured using the VLT and Keck Telescopes (Drinkwater et al. 2003, Natur, 423, 519). The velocity dispersions range from 24-37 km s- 1, considerably higher than those of Galactic GCs. The UCDs lie well off the globular cluster L [formula] σ1.7 relation (Fig 1) in a previously unoccupied region. The locations of the UCDs and the dE,Ns on the diagram strongly support the galaxy threshing model. A normal dE,N halo, accounting for ~  98% of the dE,Ns luminosity, is tidally stripped therefore reducing the total luminosity by a factor of 100 but barely changing the central velocity dispersion. Over time this disruption contributes diffuse stellar material to the ICM. The surviving nuclei are dispersed into intra-cluster space or added to the envelopes of brighter galaxies, where they can masquerade as stars. This process may explain the observed high "specific frequency" of GCs in central cluster galaxies.

We also obtained deep multicolour (u,g,r,i,z) imaging of the central 2 square degree region of the Fornax Cluster using the CTIO 4m MOSAIC Telescope (0.27''pix≈  27 pc). This revealed a 43 kpc-long plume of tidal debris 0.5 degrees from the cluster centre, flanking the dE,N cluster member FCC 252 (Fig 2). The diffuse stellar material has μg=26.9 mag arcsec- 2 and Mg  ≈   -14, comparable to faint Local Group dwarf spheroidals (Mateo 1998, ARA&A, 36, 435). The proximity of the debris suggests we may be witnessing galaxy threshing in action. The stellar populations of the UCDs, dE,Ns and GCs associated with NGC 1399 will be determined from two-colour diagrams. This will provide a further test of the galaxy threshing hypothesis. We require higher resolution observations of FCC 252 and the debris to determine their possible tidal relationship.
