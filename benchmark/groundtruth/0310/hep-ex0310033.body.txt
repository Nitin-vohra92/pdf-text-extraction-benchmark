Introduction

Precision tests have shown a remarkable agreement between experimental data and predictions from the Standard Model, especially in the electroweak sector [\cite=PippaWells]. However, the Standard Model does not explain the huge value of the Planck scale () with respect to the electroweak scale (): [formula]. It has recently been pointed out that this hierarchy problem can be solved if gravity propagates in more dimensions than the Standard Model particles.

Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali (ADD) proposed a model [\cite=ADD] in which gravity propagates freely in n extra, compact spatial dimensions. In their model, the electroweak scale is the only fundamental scale, and the apparent large Planck scale follows directly from the existence of extra dimensions. From a generalization of the gravitational potential in 4 + n dimensions, they find for the radius R of these extra dimensions: [formula], where is the fundamental scale in 4 + n dimensions, and is the apparent 4-dimensional Planck scale. Taking [formula], [formula] for n = 2 and [formula] for n  ≥  3. It is remarkable that from direct gravitational measurements, only n  ≤  2 has been excluded at present [\cite=SalvatoreMele]. Note that in the ADD approach, the size of the extra dimensions is "large" with respect to [formula].

Randall and Sundrum (RS) propose a 5-dimensional model [\cite=RS] in which the 4-dimensional metric is multiplied by an exponential "warp" factor e- 2krcφ, where k is the 5-dimensional Planck scale. The fifth dimension appears as a finite interval 0  ≤  φ  ≤  π whose size is given by rc. Even if rc is small, a large hierarchy can be generated by this exponential factor. In other words, the size of the extra dimension in the RS model is relatively small compared to the size of the extra dimensions in the ADD approach.

In both models, effects of the extra dimensions could become visible in collider experiments at the scale.

Experimental Signatures

In hadron-hadron collisions, real gravitons can be produced in association with a jet or a photon [\cite=GRW]. The graviton propagates in the extra dimensions and is therefore invisible in a detector. It will manifest itself as missing transverse energy ().

Virtual graviton exchange will modify the cross section for di-lepton and di-photon production. The exact experimental observation is different for the two models. In the RS model, the size of the extra dimension is small and thus the separation between the Kaluza-Klein modes (quantized energy levels in the finite extra dimension) of the graviton is large. Therefore, the graviton will be produced resonantly. However, in the ADD model the separation between the graviton Kaluza-Klein modes is small (as small as [formula] for n = 4 [\cite=GRW]) due to the size of the extra dimensions. This will lead to an overall modification of the cross section at high di-lepton or di-photon invariant mass.

The cross section for di-lepton or di-photon production in the presence of extra dimensions can be written as

[formula]

with [formula]. The parameter M is the invariant mass of the two particles and θ* is the scattering angle in the centre-of-mass frame. The term [formula] describes the Standard Model cross section, [formula] the interference of the graviton-induced amplitude with that of the Standard Model processes, and [formula] describes the pure graviton exchange term. Different formalisms exist for the dimensionless parameter :

[formula]

In the remainder of this paper, experimental searches for graviton emission and exchange at the Tevatron collider will be presented. During Run I, the centre-of-mass energy was [formula] whereas during the ongoing Run II, it has been increased to [formula], with higher instantaneous and integrated luminosities. In addition, a brief overview of prospects at the LHC collider ([formula]) is given. This is discussed in more detail in [\cite=LaurentVacavant].

Experimental Results

Graviton Emission in the ADD Model

The CDF collaboration has searched for graviton emission in the jets +  channel, based on an integrated luminosity of [formula] collected during Run I. The main background in this channel is  + jets production, where the boson decays invisibly in a neutrino-antineutrino pair. As can be seen from the distribution in Fig. [\ref=fig:CDFjets], the data agree well with expectation in the absence of extra dimensions.

This leads to lower limits on of 1, 770, 710 for n = 2,  4,  6, respectively. These results are very similar to the previously established DØ limits in this channel [\cite=D0jets]. A similar search by the CDF collaboration in the γ +  channel gives no excess above the expectation from the Standard Model and thus lower limits on of 549, 581, 602 for n = 4,  6,  8, respectively. The sensitivity in the jets +  sample is higher due to the larger cross section.

At the LHC, with [formula] of integrated luminosity, discovery of extra dimensions in the jets    +     channel is possible up to high mass scales. As shown by the ATLAS collaboration [\cite=LaurentVacavant], significant signals can be found up to values of of 9.1, 7.0, 6.0 for n = 2,  3,  4.

Graviton Exchange in the ADD Model

Both the CDF and DØ collaborations have searched for virtual graviton exchange in the ADD model. CDF analyzed the invariant mass spectrum of photon pairs from an integrated luminosity of approximately [formula], collected during Run I. The selected sample agrees well with the expectation from Standard Model induced di-photon production and from misidentified di-photon events. A similar agreement was found in a di-electron sample, leading to lower limits on in the Hewett convention (see Eq. ([\ref=eq:Hewett])) given in Table [\ref=tab:CDFdiEM-ADD].

The DØ collaboration presented results on di-muon events in 30 of integrated luminosity in Run II. Background to graviton exchange in this decay mode is mainly caused by Standard Model di-muon production, estimated from a Monte Carlo simulation, and by heavy quark decay, estimated from the data itself. Similarly, di-photon and di-electron events were studied in 120 of integrated luminosity in Run II. Background from Standard Model di-photon and di-electron production was estimated from Monte Carlo simulations, and background from misidentified QCD events was derived from the data sample. In both channels, a good agreement between data and background estimates was observed in distributions of both the invariant mass and the scattering angle.

A 10-15% higher sensitivity to graviton exchange is expected from fitting the data in the M versus cos θ* plane [\cite=LandsbergCheung] instead of in M only. This is illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:D0diEM-ADD]. In the di-muon sample, such a two-dimensional fit (see Eq. ([\ref=eq:2d-crosssection])) yields [formula] and in the combined di-photon, di-electron sample [formula]. This translates into lower limits on given in Table [\ref=tab:D0diEMdiMu-ADD].

Graviton Resonance Production in the RS Model

The CDF collaboration has performed a search for graviton resonance production in the di-muon and di-electron decay channels, using an integrated luminosity of 72 collected during Run II. The invariant mass distribution found in this data in both channels agrees well with the expectation from the Standard Model, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:CDFdiEl-RS] for the di-electron channel. This leads to lower limits on the RS graviton, given in Table [\ref=tab:CDF-RS]. The ATLAS collaboration expects a sensitivity up to a mass of 2 in 100 of integrated luminosity at the LHC [\cite=LaurentVacavant].

Conclusion and Outlook

To explain the large difference between the Planck scale and the electroweak scale, models have been proposed in which gravity propagates in more than four dimensions. The effects of these higher dimensional models were searched for at the Tevatron, and were not found, yet. Lower limits on the higher dimensional Planck scale were set, reaching over 1 in current Tevatron Run II data. The combined di-photon and di-electron sample of DØ provides the most stringent limits on the ADD model. In the near future, more data from Run II at the Tevatron will become available, increasing the sensitivity to extra dimensions. After 2007, the experiments at the LHC will take over and explore and possibly discover extra dimensions up to multi-   scales.
