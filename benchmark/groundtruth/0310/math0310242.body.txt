Singularity structure in mean curvature flow of mean convex sets

In this note we announce results on the mean curvature flow of mean convex sets; all the statements below have natural generalizations to the setting of Riemannian 3-manifolds, but for the sake of simplicity we will primarily discuss subsets of [formula] here. Loosely speaking, our results justify the naive picture of mean curvature flow where the only singularities are neck pinches, and components which collapse to asymptotically round spheres. Recall that a one-parameter family of smooth hypersurfaces [formula] flows by mean curvature if

[formula]

where [formula] are coordinates on [formula] and [formula] is the mean curvature vector. The papers [\cite=evansspruck] and [\cite=chengigagoto] defined a level set flow for any closed subset K of [formula]. This is a 1-parameter family of closed sets [formula] with K0 = K (when K is a domain bounded by a smooth compact hypersurface then the evolution of ∂K for a short time interval coincides with the classical mean curvature evolution). Following [\cite=white1], we say that a compact subset [formula] is mean convex if [formula] for all t > 0. In this case there is also an associated Brakke flow M:t  ↦  Mt of rectifiable varifolds [\cite=brakke] [\cite=ilmanen] [\cite=white1], and the pair (M,K), where

[formula]

is called a mean-convex flow, [\cite=white2]. The fundamental papers [\cite=white1] [\cite=white2] developed a far-reaching partial regularity theory for mean curvature flow of mean convex subsets of [formula]. Our results build on [\cite=white1] [\cite=white2], giving finer understanding of the singularities in the 3-dimensional case. Recall that the main result of [\cite=white1] asserts that the space time singular set of the region swept out by a mean-convex set in [formula] has parabolic Hausdorff dimension at most (n - 1), and [\cite=white2] proved a structure theorem for blow-ups of mean-convex flows; cf. also [\cite=huiskensinestrari1] [\cite=huiskensinestrari0]. We expect that the more refined description of singularities given here will open the way for applications of mean convex flow to geometric and/or topological problems involving mean convex surfaces.

When (M,K) is a mean convex flow in [formula], then for almost every time t the time slice Kt is a domain with smooth boundary, [\cite=white1]. Our first result shows that the high curvature portion of such smooth time slices has standard local geometry:

For all ε  >  0 there is a number h0 = h0(ε) with the following property. If (M,K) is a mean convex flow in [formula] and Kt is a regular time slice of K for some t > 0, then there is a decomposition [formula], such that

For all x∈Gt, and after rescaling by the factor [formula] the pointed subset (Kt,x) is ε-close to some pointed half-space (P,p) in the pointed [formula]-topology.

Each component of Bt is diffeomorphic to the 3-ball or a solid torus, and for all [formula], the pointed subset (Kt,x) becomes, after rescaling by the factor H(x), ε-close to a pointed convex model subset (V,v) in the pointed [formula]-topology. Here [formula] is a convex set whose tangent cone at infinity is either a point, a line, or a ray, and V looks like a round cylinder near infinity, in the following sense: for every δ > 0 there is a compact set K  ⊂  V, such that for every v'∈V lying outside K, if we rescale V by H(v'), the resulting pointed subset (V,v') is δ-close to a round cylinder in the pointed [formula]-topology.

Note that the bounds on the geometry deteriorate as one approaches ∂K; this is by necessity since no regularity condition has been imposed on K. If K happens to be smooth, then standard estimates for smooth mean curvature flow control the geometry of Kt when [formula], where r is the normal injectivity radius of ∂K. Theorem 2 may be compared with the recent work of Huisken-Sinestrari [\cite=huiskensinestrari], where a similar geometric description was obtained for mean curvature flow of smooth hypersurfaces in [formula] where the sum of the first two principal curvatures is positive. The results in [\cite=perelman1] are also in a similar spirit. Note that their results only apply to the evolution prior to the formation of the first singularity, whereas our results, like those in [\cite=white1] [\cite=white2], apply even after the formation of a singularity. (In fact, the methods yield a decomposition of arbitrary time slices, which we omit for the sake of simplicity.)

It follows from the strong maximum principle and compactness that the sets ∂Kt for t  ≥  0 are disjoint, and define a "singular foliation" of the original set K. Our next theorem proves Hölder regularity of the singular set of the foliation ∂Kt.

The foliation defined by the sets ∂Kt is smooth on the complement of a closed subset S  ⊂  K which satisfies the following Reifenberg-type condition: for all ε > 0 there is an r0 = r0(ε) such that if r < r0 and x∈S, then there is a line [formula] such that [formula] is contained in the tubular neighborhood Nεr(A). In particular, S lies in a 1-dimensional topological submanifold γ  ⊂  K which admits a [formula]-biHölder parametrization for all α  <  1. Furthermore, the mean curvature defines a proper function on [formula].

After passing through a singularity the topological type of a surface flowing by mean curvature can change. In [\cite=white3] White proved some results comparing the homology of the surface before and after such a singularity. Our next theorem shows that the region between two regular time slices is obtained from the earlier time slice by attaching 2 and 3-handles. Recall that attaching a k-handle to the boundary of an n-manifold N is essentially just the process of attaching a fattened-up k-disk to ∂N along the (k - 1)-sphere, i.e. one glues Dk  ×  Dn - k to ∂N along ∂Dk  ×  Dn - k.

If 0  ≤  t  <  t' and Kt,Kt' are regular time slices, then [formula] is a compact 3-manifold with boundary which may be obtained from ∂Kt by attaching k-handles for k = 2,3.

Our final theorem deals with mean convex flow in a general 3-manifold, where the flow may converge as time tends to infinity to a set K∞ with nonempty interior.

Let M be a compact Riemannian 3-manifold, and K  ⊂  M a mean convex subset with smooth boundary. Then as t  →    ∞  , the intersection of the sets Kt converges to a (possibly empty) domain [formula], where each boundary component of K∞ is a smooth, weakly stable minimal surface, and [formula]. Furthermore, any compact minimal surface in [formula] is contained in ∂K∞; in particular ∂K∞ is homologically minimizing in the domain [formula].
