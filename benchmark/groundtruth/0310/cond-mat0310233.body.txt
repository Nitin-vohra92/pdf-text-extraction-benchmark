Self-organized Model for Modular Complex Networks : Division and Independence

Recently, considerable effort has been made to understand complex systems in terms of random graphs, consisting of vertices and edges [\cite=Strogatz01] [\cite=Albert02] [\cite=Dorogovtsev02] [\cite=Newman03a]. Such complex networks exhibit many interesting emerging patterns as follows: First, the degree distribution follows a power-law, P(k)  ~  k-  γ, where the degree is the number of edges connecting to a given vertex [\cite=Barabasi99]. Such networks, called scale-free (SF), are ubiquitous in the real world. To illustrate such SF behavior in the degree distribution, Barabási and Albert (BA) [\cite=Barabasi99] introduced an in silico model: Initially, fully-connected m0 vertices exist in a system. At each time step, a vertex is newly added and connects to m existing vertices, which are chosen with a probability linearly proportional to the degree of target vertex. Such a selection rule is called the preferential attachment (PA) rule.

Secondly, many real world networks have modular structures within them. Modular structures form geographically in the Internet [\cite=Eriksen03], functionally in metabolic [\cite=Ravasz02] or protein interaction networks [\cite=Rives03], or following social activities in social networks [\cite=Girvan02] [\cite=Guimera02]. In these modular complex networks, the hierarchical clustering coefficient of a vertex with degree k, denoted by C(k), behaves as C(k)  ~  k-  β [\cite=Ravasz02] [\cite=Ravasz03], where the clustering coefficient is defined as the ratio of the number of triangles connected to a given vertex to the number of triples centered on that vertex. Also the clustering coefficient averaged over all vertices is independent of system size N. In the BA model, however, C(k) is independent of k, but depends on N [\cite=Albert02] [\cite=Ravasz03], because the BA model does not contain modules. To understand the behavior of C(k), a deterministic hierarchical model was introduced by Ravasz and Barabási  [\cite=Ravasz03], in which C(k)  ~  k- 1 and the clustering coefficient C is independent of N [\cite=Noh03]. While it is important to understand the mechanism for the formation of such modular structure through an in silico model, few models have been studied, and none in which the modules were generated in a self-organized way. Thus it is our goal of this paper to introduce such a model.

Thirdly, the degree-degree correlation in real world networks is nontrivial. The nontrivial behavior is measured in terms of the mixing coefficient r [\cite=Newman02], a Pearson correlation coefficient between the remaining degrees of the two vertices on each side of an edge, where the remaining degree means the degree of that vertex minus one. Complex networks can be classified according to the mixing coefficient r into three types, having r  <  0, r  ≈  0, and r > 0, called the dissortative, the neutral, and the assortative network, respectively [\cite=Newman02]. An assortative or dissorative network can also be identified by a quantity, denoted by 〈knn〉(k), the average degree of a neighboring vertex of a vertex with degree k  [\cite=Pastor-Satorras01]. For the assortative (dissortative) network, 〈knn〉(k) increases (decreases) with increasing k, i.e., a power law 〈knn〉(k)  ~  k-  ν is satisfied where ν is negative (positive) for the assortative (dissortative) network  [\cite=Pastor-Satorras01].

In this paper, we are interested in modelling modular complex networks, in particular, forming in a self-organized way. In social networks, modules represent the communities each individual belongs to, which may evolve as time passes. The karate club (KC) network, originally proposed by Zachary [\cite=Zachary77], is an example of a social network containing community structures. Recently, Newman and Girvan  [\cite=Girvan02] studied the KC network to test a new algorithm for clustering communities [\cite=Girvan02] [\cite=Zhou03]. Here we notice that the KC network contains an important ingredient, division and independence, needed for the formation of modular structure, in addition to growth and PA principles as noticed in the BA model. Thus we introduce a network model evolving by such principles, and perform numerical simulations for large system size. Indeed, we find that the model exhibits a characteristic feature of modular structure, C(k)  ~  k- 1 as much as those for empirical data.

To be specific, the main dynamic process of the evolution of the KC network is as follows. In a KC, a disagreement develops between the administrator of the club and the club's instructor as time goes on, ultimately resulting in the instructor leaving (division) and founding a new club (independence), accompanied by about half the original club's members. This generic feature of division and independence can be observed in many other social communities such as schools, companies, churches, clubs, parties, etc. For example, in the coauthorship network, a graduate student publishes papers with her/his thesis advisor, so that they are connected in a coauthorship network. When she/he graduates and becomes a professor in another school (division), she/he also get her/his own students, creating a new group (independence).

To model the evolution of the KC network, we modify the BA model by assigning a color to each vertex. The color assigned to each vertex indicates the group the vertex belongs to. The dynamic rule of our model is as follows:

(i) BA model (Growth and PA) : Initially, there exist m0 vertices. They are fully connected. Each vertex i is assigned the same index of color μi = 1. Thus the total number of distinct colors q = 1. At each time step, a vertex is introduced and connects to m existing vertices following the PA rule. Here m is not fixed, but is distributed uniformly among integers in the range
