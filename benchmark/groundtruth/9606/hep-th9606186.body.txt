Introduction

The typical relation which links heterotic SUSY with differential topology is [\cite=k:ch]

[formula]

[formula]

DMF (Heterotic SUSY) is an heterotic SUSY-Feynmann integration measure which splits in bosonic and heterotic fermionic parts:

[formula]

S(Hetrotic SUSY) is a heterotic SUSY action. (H. SUSY. B. C) is a heterotic set of SUSY boundary conditions:

[formula]

(B. B. C) is a set of bosonic boundary conditions. (H. F. B. C) is a heterotic set of fermionic boundary conditions. ([\ref=1.1]) can be written as (using ([\ref=1.2]) and ([\ref=1.3]):

[formula]

For to evaluate the heterotic SUSY path integral of ([\ref=1.4]) one must give a heterotic SUSY lagrangian.

The Lagrangian

[formula]

{gi} is a set of metrics. {Fi} is a set of curvatures of Yang-Mills field. Φ is a set of bosonic coordinates. {Ψ,{Ψi}} is a set of fermionic fields. {α,β,{βi},{γi}} is a set of constants. [formula] is the derivate of Φ with respect to the time. [formula], [formula] is a set of covariant derivates with respect [formula].

Taking Φ like a perturbation U with respect to a background Φ0 (Φ  =  Φ0  +  U). Taking Ψ1 like a perturbation with respect to a background Ψ0: [\cite=kob:fu] Ψ1 = AUΨ0. [formula]; LU is the Lie derivate with respect to U. Taking Ψ3, Ψ4 paraleles (constants) and using [formula]; ([\ref=2.1]) transforms to:

[formula]

In tensorial notation ([\ref=2.2]) can be written as:

[formula]

Where small latin indexes correspond to bosonic target space; capital indexes correspond to the group of the Yang-Mills field F1; greek indexes correspond to the group of the Yang-Mills field F2 (the first ones) and the Yang-Mills field F3 (the last ones).

The Integration Measure

Tha bosonic measure is

[formula]

The heterotic fermionic measure is

[formula]

([\ref=1.2]) can be written as:

[formula]

Boundary Conditions

([\ref=1.3]) can be written as:

[formula]

The Calculation of the Path Integral

Using ([\ref=2.3]), ([\ref=3.1]), ([\ref=4.1]) and assuming that [formula] and g≃δ; ([\ref=1.4]) transforms to: ( [formula] )

[formula]

The regularization of ([\ref=5.1]) is:

[formula]

{yi} is the set of eigenvalues of F1 (matrix 2S  ×  2S). Â(R) is de Dirac genus. ch(F) is the Chern character for the Yang-Mills F2. ed / 2 is the cohomological term for the Yang-Mills F3. M is the bosonic space.

Mayer's Theorem

([\ref=5.2]) is a integrality theorem for the manifold M. ([\ref=5.2]) is the integrality theorem due to Mayer trated by Hirzebruch. In fact: [\cite=hi:to]

Considering that Yang-Mills F1 corresponds to a SO(2S)-bundle over M with formal factorisation [formula]. Considering that Yang-Mills F2 corresponds to a [formula]-bundle over X. Considering that Yang-Mills F3 induces an element [formula] whose reduction mod  2 is w2(X) + w2(F1). Then ([\ref=5.2]) is the expresion of cohomological quantization for M. ([\ref=5.2]) is the Mayer's theorem.

Conclusions

([\ref=5.2]) was obtained using (B.C)ψ2; if one use another boundary conditions for Ψ2, to say, (B.C)'Ψ2; one obtain:

[formula]

([\ref=5.2]) and ([\ref=6.1]) have the following generalizations: [\cite=k:ch]
