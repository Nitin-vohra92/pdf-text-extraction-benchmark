Abstract

The experiments of producing a Ψ (we use the symbol Ψ instead of J / Ψ) or a Ψ' meson in a collision of a hadron h with a nucleus A, at energies Eh of several hundreds of GeV have yielded a number of unexpected results, of which we will recall the most significant ones. Since we want to limit ourselves to nuclear effects and not absolute cross sections, it is convenient to introduce the nuclear suppression function

[formula]

which depends on the energy Eh of the hadron, and the Feynman variable xF of the Ψ.

The experimental results under discussion here are: (i) The value for SpAΨ(Eh,xF) in the interval 0  <  xF  <  x0 seems to depend on Eh, the suppression factor being smaller for E = 800 GeV 1) than for E = 200 GeV 2). (ii) For xF  >  0 in pA collisions one has nearly the same nuclear suppression for the Ψ and Ψ' mesons1). (iii) Ψ' turns out to be more suppressed than J / Ψ in nucleus-nucleus collisions, SABΨ'  <  SABΨ 3).

In the present paper we discuss quantum interference effects, which are not ad hoc mechanisms (and do not need any unknown parameters), but can explain, at least partially, the above effects.

Nuclear suppression of charmonium depends on the production mechanism even in the simplest case of eikonal approximation. Charmonium production on a nucleon at high energy may be seen in the lab. frame as interaction of a fluctuation of the projectile hadron, containing charm quarks, which frees the charmonium. We single out two types of interaction: a) Direct interaction of the c projectile fluctuation with the target. This interaction must me sufficiently hard to resolve the size of the c pair in order to make it colorless. b) Interaction of the light spectator partons accompanying the c pair, freeing the charmonium. This interaction can be soft i.e. have a large cross section at x1  →  1 4).

We assume hereafter the dominance of the direct mechanism a), which restricts our consideration to small values of xF.

Since the charmonium production is a hard process, a soft initial/final state interaction, which cannot resolve the c fluctuation, does not produce any shadowing. Charmonia produced on different nucleons add up incoherently, since the longitudinal momentum transfer is large, qL  =  Eq(1 - x1), where [formula].

There is also a possibility of an additional hard scattering which frees the c pair "elastically" in advance of the inelastic interaction. Namely, the projectile hadron can experience a hard diffractive excitation with a colorless exchange (Pomeron) in t-channel, which puts the c fluctuation on mass shall. The longitudinal momentum transfer to the target nucleon may be small, provided that the energy is high,

[formula]

If qc  ≪  1 / RA, different nucleons contribute coherently.

The excited hadron propagates through the nucleus and produces the final charmonium with energy x1Eh in another interaction. Although the hard diffractive cross section is quite small, such a correction turns out to be very important, since it substantially increases the attenuation of the charmonium at high energy.

We skip the full expression for SγAΨ, which is too lengthy and can be found in 5,6), where it was derived for the first time. That expression can be simplified using smallness of σΨNtot〈T〉  ≪  1 (compare with 7)).

[formula]

where 〈T〉 is the mean nuclear thickness and the nuclear "longitudinal formfactor",

[formula]

takes into account the phase shifts between the waves produced at different points.

We conclude from ([\ref=2]) that the nuclear shadowing correction at high energy (F2A(qc)  →  1) is twice as big as at low energy (F2A(qc)  →  0). This important result has a natural space-time interpretation: at high energy the lifetime of the c fluctuation of the photon, tc = 1 / qc (called coherence time or length), is long and the mean path of the c pair in the nucleus is doubled compared to that at low energy 8). Thus, ShAΨ decreases with xF.

In order to improve the eikonal Glauber approximation one should take into account the off diagonal diffractive rescatterings of the charmonium in the nucleus. We restrict our consideration to a two-coupled-channel problem, including [formula] and [formula]. The initially produced c state Ψ0 has its representation

[formula]

The evolution of this state through the nucleus can written in matrix representation,

[formula]

where

[formula]

with

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula] is the operator of the c-nucleon diffractive scattering amplitude. q1 and q2 are the transferred longitudinal momenta in photoproduction of Ψ and Ψ' respectively, as it is defined in eq. ([\ref=1]).

[formula]

Exact solution is presented in 5), however, it is instructive to solve the equation ([\ref=14a]) to first order in σΨNtot, neglecting the effect of coherence length considered above. Then we find for the nuclear suppression of the Ψ and Ψ' states

[formula]

[formula]

We estimate matrix elements ([\ref=16a]) - ([\ref=17a]) at [formula] and r = 7 / 3 and from experimental data |Rex|  =  0.48  ±  0.06 5). As opposite to the effect of the coherence length discussed in the previous section, the growth of the formation length leads to the increase of SpAΨ. This is because the produced initial state |Ψ0〉 turns out to be nearly an eigenstate of interaction, provided that the parameters ε, r and R have values we estimated. Such an eigenstate has the absorption cross section smaller than any of its components, Ψ or Ψ'. This explains the growth of SpAΨ with EΨ, predicted by ([\ref=18a]).

As soon as the produced c state |Ψ0〉 is the eigen state, it does not change its Ψ-Ψ' content during propagation through the nucleus, i.e. the relative yields of Ψ' to Ψ has no A-dependence at high EΨ as was observed in 1). This is demonstrated in Fig. [\ref=fig1] versus xF 5) in comparison with data 1,3).

Now we can turn on the coherence length and combine the two effects. In the approximation of small σΨNtot〈T〉  ≪  1 we get

[formula]

[formula]

Since the effects of the coherence and formation lengths act in opposite directions, their interplay leads to a nontrivial xF-dependence of the nuclear transparency as is shown in fig. [\ref=fig2]. We present the results of exact solution of the two-channel problem, described in 9).

Note that according to Fig. [\ref=fig2] we expect a decreasing energy-dependence of SpAΨ as function of energy at fixed xF. This may explain the observed 1,2) energy dependence of nuclear suppression. We remind that our calculations are restricted to small values of xF.

One may expect new phenomena in heavy ion collisions. First of all, the multiparticle production becomes so intensive that it may cause an additional suppression of charmonium. There might be also an unusual phenomenon, a quark-gluon plasma formation, in such collisions. We still have no reliable calculations of those effects, but in any case one needs a solid theoretical base line to compare the measurements with. The so called standard absorption model, which corresponds to lc = lf = 0, is obviously oversimplified, because existence of the quantum interference effects, discussed above, is notnegotiable, and they are very important

We expect the nuclear effects for charmonium production in AA collisions to be quite different from what is known for pA collision. This is because the coherence and formation lengths depend on whether we are in the rest frame of the target or of the beam. Due to the inverse kinematics the charmonium wave packet attenuates with different effective cross sections propagating through the two colliding nuclei. The nuclear suppression in A1A2 collision is simply related to that in pA1 and pA2 interactions,

[formula]

Our previous conclusion about equal nuclear suppression of Ψ and Ψ' in pA interaction is not valid for AA collisions. The results of application of ([\ref=last]) to the ratio SABΨ' / SABΨ 5) are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig3].

We see that this ratio, which is unity in pA interactions is substantially below one in the case of nuclear collisions. However, this reduction explains only about a half of the observed effect, shown in Fig. [\ref=fig3] by the only available experimental point 3).

The quantum effects related to interference between amplitudes of charmonium production on different nucleons and to a composite structure of the produced charmonium wave packet lead to a substantial modification of the theoretical expectations. We predict quite an unusual xF- and energy-dependence of the nuclear suppression for Ψ, which agree with available data. We are also able to explain why the nuclear suppression factors for Ψ and Ψ' are the same in proton-nucleus, but different in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Numerically, however, the observed effect seems to be larger. This invites one to take into account the interaction of the charmonium with other produced particles, which is the next step to be done.
