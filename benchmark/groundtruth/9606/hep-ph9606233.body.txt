Introduction

Recently Hill [\cite=tc2] introduced top-color assisted technicolor (TC2) in order to explain electroweak symmetry breaking via a dynamical mechanism and to allow for a large top quark mass. In this model a top-condensate is driven by the combination of a strong isospin-symmetric top-color interaction and an additional (possibly weak, but probably strong) isospin-breaking U(1) interaction. He argued that the extreme fine-tuning that was required in pure top-condensate models can be done away with if the scales of the critical top-color and U(1) interactions are brought down to a TeV. Given a top quark mass of around 175 GeV, such top-color interactions would produce masses for the W and Z that are far too small, hence there must be further strong interactions (technicolor) that are primarily responsible for breaking electroweak symmetry.

The authors of ref. [\cite=tc2isospin] argued that the isospin breaking U(1) gauge interactions, which are necessary in order to split the top and bottom quark masses, are likely to have isospin-violating couplings to technifermions. In this case they produce a significant shift in the W and Z masses (i.e. contribute to Δρ*  =  αT). In order to satisfy experimental constraints on Δρ*, they found that either the effective top quark coupling or the top-color coupling must be tuned to 1%.

Subsequently, Lane and Eichten [\cite=naturaltc2] showed that it was possible to construct models in which the technifermions had only isospin symmetric charges under the new U(1). They referred to such models as "natural" TC2 models. In order to produce mixing among heavy and light generations, such models seem to require direct couplings of the new U(1) to fermions in the first two generations [\cite=lane], and thus predict a variety of effects which are potentially observable in precision electroweak measurements.

In this paper we perform global fits to precision data for three examples of natural TC2 scenarios: a simple "baseline" scenario with universal couplings to quarks and leptons (of a sort in which it does not seem too difficult to allow for mixing), an "optimal" scenario where it is assumed that there is no direct coupling to the first two generations, and an explicit model due to Lane [\cite=lane] where new U(1) charges have been assigned to all the known fermions in such a way as to allow for intergenerational mixing and gauge anomaly cancelation. For the "baseline" and "optimal" scenarios, we find that the [formula] must typically weigh more than 2 TeV, although for the "optimal" scenario the [formula] mass can be substantially smaller for a range of gauge couplings. For Lane's model [\cite=lane], in which there are couplings of O(10), we find that the [formula] must weigh more than approximately 20 TeV.

Electroweak Phenomenology of Top-Color Assisted Technicolor

The electroweak gauge symmetry in TC2 models is SU(2)L  ×  U(1)1  ×  U(1)2. Here U(1)2 is the, presumably strong, interaction with isospin-violating quark couplings (that allows for top-quark, but not for bottom-quark, condensation) and U(1)1 is a weak gauge interaction. The pattern of electroweak gauge symmetry breaking that is required is more complicated than that in ordinary technicolor models; it generally involves two scales (rather than just one) to break the SU(2)L  ×  U(1)1  ×  U(1)2 symmetry down to U(1)em. The required pattern of breaking is:

U(1)em,

where hypercharge, Y = Y1  +  Y2, is equal to the sum of the generators of the two U(1)'s.

The gauge covariant derivative is given in the canonical basis by

[formula]

where the Ta, a = 1 to 3, are the generators of SU(2). The gauge couplings may be written

[formula]

in terms of the usual weak mixing angle θ and a new mixing angle φ. It is convenient to rewrite the neutral gauge bosons in terms of the photon,

[formula]

which couples to electric charge Q with strength e, a field

[formula]

which couples as the standard model Z would couple, to T3  -  Q sin 2θ with strength

[formula]

and the field

[formula]

which couples to the current [formula] with strength

[formula]

In this basis, using the relation

[formula]

and the fact that Q is conserved, the mass-squared matrix for the Z1 and Z2 can be written as:

[formula]

where, from the charged-W masses we see that < T3T3  >    =  v2  ≈  (250  GeV)2.

In natural TC2 models (where the strong U(1) couplings to technifermions are isospin symmetric) the expectation value leading to Z1  -  Z2 mixing, , can be calculated entirely in terms of the gauge couplings, v, and the Y2 charges of the left- and right-handed top quark. Using the definition of [formula], we see that

[formula]

Since Y = Q - T3 and Q is conserved, the last term is equal to +   sin 2φ < T3T3  >  . Furthermore in natural TC2 models, since the technifermion Y2-charges are assumed to be isospin symmetric, the technifermions do not contribute to the first term. The only contribution to the first term comes from the top-quark condensate

[formula]

where ft is the analog of fπ for the top-condensate and is equal to

[formula]

in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio [\cite=NJL] approximation, and M is the top-gluon mass. For mt  ≈  175 GeV and M  ≈  1 TeV, we find ft  ≈  64 GeV.

If we define

[formula]

and

[formula]

the Z1  -  Z2 mass matrix can be written as

[formula]

In the large-x limit the mass eigenstates are

[formula]

The shifts in the Z coupling to [formula] (with e / ( cos θ sin θ) factored out) are therefore given by:

[formula]

Mixing also shifts the Z mass, and gives a contribution to T equal to:

[formula]

The shifts in the Z-couplings and mass are sufficient to describe electroweak phenomenology on the Z-peak. For low-energy processes, in addition to these effects we must also consider the effects of [formula]-exchange. To leading order in 1 / x, these effects may be summarized by the four-fermion interaction

[formula]

where JY2 and JY are the Y2- and hypercharge-currents, respectively. It is useful to note that if ε is negative, then all the Z pole mixing effects (equations ([\ref=dg]) and ([\ref=T])) vanish when sin 2φ  =    -  ε, although the low-energy effects of [formula] exchange do not.

The result of all these corrections is that the predicted values of many electroweak observables are altered from those given by the standard model [\cite=fit] [\cite=unun] [\cite=NClimits]. The shifts in the predictions depend on the charge assignments of the quarks and leptons under the new U(1). The "baseline" scenario we consider in this paper has universal couplings of the strong U(1) to quarks and leptons given by Y2 = Y (and Y1 = 0 for the ordinary fermions). This results in a shift in the total Z width given by:

[formula]

The full list of changes to the electroweak observables for this "baseline" scenario appears in the Appendix.

For the "optimal" scenario we take the generation-dependent charge assignments of Y2 to have the values of ordinary hypercharge on the third generation, and zero on the first two generations. This results, for example, in a shift in the total Z width:

[formula]

For Lane's model we use the charge assignments given in the Appendix of ref. [\cite=lane]. These charges are listed in Table [\ref=laneQ], with a normalization implied by equation ([\ref=Q]). The shift in the total Z width in Lane's model is given by:

[formula]

Comparison with Data

Data and the Standard Model

Before describing the details of the fit, we briefly discuss higher-order corrections. Beyond tree-level, the predictions of the standard model (as well as predictions of extended models like those we are discussing) depend on the values of αs(MZ) and the top-quark mass mt. Given the success of the standard model, we expect that, for the allowed range of 1 / x, the changes in the predicted values of physical observables due to radiative corrections in the standard model or extended models will be approximately the same for the same values of αs(MZ) and mt.

The best-fit standard model predictions [\cite=langacker] which we use are based on a top quark mass of 173 GeV (taken from a fit to precision electroweak data) which is consistent with the mass range preferred by CDF ([formula] GeV) and D0 (170  ±  25 GeV)[\cite=cdf].

The treatment of αs(MZ) is more problematic: the LEP determination for αs(MZ) comes from a fit to electroweak observables assuming the validity of the standard model. For this reason it is important [\cite=alphaZbb] [\cite=unun] [\cite=NClimits] to understand how the bounds vary for different values of αs(MZ). We present bounds both for αs(MZ)  =  0.124 (which is the LEP best-fit value assuming the standard model is correct [\cite=langacker]) and for αs(MZ) = 0.115 (which is the most precisely measured value, determined from lattice results [\cite=lattice] and consistent with deep-inelastic scattering [\cite=langacker] [\cite=deep]). To the accuracy to which we work, the αs dependence of the standard model predictions only appears in the Z partial widths and we use [\cite=langacker]

[formula]

to obtain the standard model predictions for α(MZ) = 0.115.

With the above caveats, we have performed a global fit for the "baseline" TC2 scenario, the "optimal" TC2 scenario, and for Lane's model to all precision electroweak data: the Z line shape, forward backward asymmetries, τ polarization, and left-right asymmetry measured at LEP and SLC; the W mass measured at FNAL and UA2; the electron and neutrino neutral current couplings determined by deep-inelastic scattering; the degree of atomic parity violation measured in Cesium; and the ratio of the decay widths of τ  →  μν and μ  →  eν.

Results of Fitting

Using the current experimental values we have fit the "baseline" and "optimal" TC2 scenarios and Lane's TC2 model to the data. Figure 1 summarizes the fit to the "baseline" scenario (with universal couplings to quarks and leptons) by displaying the 95% confidence level lower bound on the [formula] mass for different values of sin 2φ (αs(MZ)  =  0.115 corresponds to the solid line and αs(MZ)  =  0.124 to the dashed line). The plot was created as follows: for each value of sin 2φ we fit to 1 / x; we then found the upper bound on 1 / x and translated it into a lower bound on the [formula] mass. The resulting bounds are quite sensitive to αs(MZ), with αs(MZ) = 0.124 giving a much tighter constraint on the mass for most values of sin 2φ. The plot clearly shows a dip in the bound at sin 2φ  =    -  ε  ≈  0.07, where the [formula] mixing vanishes. For generic values of sin 2φ the 95 % bound is roughly 2 TeV. While the results shown are for the case where Y2 = Y, we expect that any model where the Y2 couplings to the first and second generations are O(1) will give similar results.

Figure 2 summarizes the fit to the "optimal" model with generation dependent couplings by displaying the 95% confidence level lower bound (solid line) on the [formula] mass for different values of sin 2φ (using αs(MZ) = 0.115; for this model the bounds are not very sensitive to the value of αs(MZ)). Also shown is the 68% confidence level lower bound (dashed line) which displays the sensitivity of the fit for different values of sin 2φ.

For Lane's model the fit results are summarized in Figure 3, which displays the 95% and 68% confidence lower bounds on the [formula] mass (solid and dashed lines) as a function of sin 2φ. The lowest possible [formula] mass at the 95% confidence level is roughly 20 TeV. The bound is significantly larger in this model since the new U(1) charges (as listed in Table [\ref=laneQ]) are O(10) rather than O(1). As anticipated by Lane [\cite=lane], the fit for this model is very sensitive to the atomic parity violation measurement in Cesium, as can be seen from the predicted value of the QW(Cs) in this model:

[formula]

The large coefficients result from the large quark charges in this model, and the large number of quarks in a Cesium atom. In a different version of Lane's model [\cite=laneunpub], where the new U(1) has vectorial couplings to leptons, the 95% confidence level bound drops to 2.7 TeV, in accord with the results of the "baseline" scenario fit.

The summary of the quality of the fits is given in Table [\ref=Fit115] for two different values of sin 2φ for both the "baseline" and "optimal" scenarios. We first show the result of allowing both sin 2φ and 1 / x to vary. For the "baseline" model the fit prefers sin 2φ to be close to 1, however this makes the coupling [formula] diverge. Requiring [formula] gives a best fit at sin 2φ = 0.99, which corresponds to a [formula] mass of [formula] TeV. For the "optimal" model the fit yields sin 2φ = 0.62 which corresponds to [formula] TeV.

Such large values of sin 2φ imply that the new U(1) gauge coupling is quite weak, and therefore such models require a fine-tuning to arrange for a top condensate but not a bottom condensate [\cite=tc2]. Thus we show a second fit where we required that [formula] (which corresponds to sin 2φ  <  0.1). Given this constraint we chose sin 2φ such that the best-fit value for 1 / x corresponded to the lightest possible mass for the [formula]. For the "baseline" model this occurs at sin 2φ = 0.036 which corresponds to [formula] TeV, while for the "optimal" model the minimum is at sin 2φ = 0.07, where there is no Z - [formula] mixing, which corresponds to [formula] GeV. A fit for Lane's model [\cite=lane] is not shown since there is no value of sin 2φ that has a best fit with a physical [formula] mass (i.e. 1 / x  >  0).

Table [\ref=Fit115] shows the fit to the standard model for comparison. The percentage quoted in the Table is the probability of obtaining a χ2 as large or larger than that obtained in the fit, for the given number of degrees of freedom (df), assuming that the model is correct. Thus a small probability corresponds to a poor fit, and a bad model. Note that the standard model gives a poor fit to the data, while the fine-tuned TC2 scenarios are only modestly better, and in the absence of fine-tuning the TC2 scenarios are slightly worse.

For comparison we have also performed the fits using αs(MZ) = 0.124; the quality of the fit is summarized in Table [\ref=Fit124]. The quality of all the fits improves, but there are only small changes in the relative goodness of fit. The best fit for the "baseline" model corresponds to an unphysical [formula] mass (i.e. 1 / x  <  0). If we require a physical [formula] mass then the fit prefers sin 2φ close to zero, so no fine-tuning is required. For sin 2φ  =  0.01 we find [formula] TeV. The best fit for the "optimal" model corresponds to sin 2φ  =  0.99 and [formula] TeV. We also show a fit for the "optimal" model where we require the absence of fine-tuning (sin 2φ < 0.1), and the lightest possible [formula] mass. We found this occurs for sin 2φ = 0.07, the value where there is no Z - [formula] mixing, which corresponds to [formula] TeV. Again we do not show a fit for Lane's model since there is no value of sin 2φ that has a best fit with a physical [formula] mass. Here the "optimal" scenario provides a better fit than the standard model if fine-tuning is allowed. In the absence of fine-tuning the TC2 scenarios give fits to the data that are slightly worse than the standard model.

Conclusions

In this paper we have used precision electroweak measurements to constrain "natural" TC2 models. The models we examined can provide a better fit to data than the standard model if fine-tuning is allowed, however in the absence of fine-tuning they generally provide a fit that is slightly worse than the poor fit given by the standard model. Generically we have found that the mass of the new [formula] in such models has to be above roughly 2 TeV. In models with no couplings of the new U(1) to the first two generations, the bound on the [formula] mass can be lower, but it seems difficult to allow for mixing between generations in such models. In the explicit model due to Lane [\cite=lane], which allows for inter-generational mixing, the bounds are much more stringent, the couplings to the first two generations are O(10), requiring a [formula] mass above 20 TeV.
