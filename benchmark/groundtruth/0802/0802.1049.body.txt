Halphen pencils on quartic threefolds

Introduction

Let X be a smooth quartic threefold in [formula]. The following result is proved in [\cite=IsMa71].

The threefold X does not contain pencils whose general element is an irreducible surface that is birational to a smooth surface of Kodaira dimension -    ∞  .

On the other hand, one can easily see that the threefold X contains infinitely many pencils whose general elements are irreducible surfaces of Kodaira dimension zero.

A Halphen pencil is a one-dimensional linear system whose general element is an irreducible subvariety birational to a smooth variety of Kodaira dimension zero.

The following result is proved in [\cite=ChPa05h].

Suppose that X is general. Then every Halphen pencil on X is cut out by

[formula]

where l1 and l2 are linearly independent linear forms, and [formula].

The assertion of Theorem [\ref=theorem:Halphen-pencils-quartic] is erroneously proved in [\cite=Ch00a] without the assumption that the threefold X is general. On the other hand, the following example is constructed in [\cite=Isk01].

Suppose that X is given by the  equation

[formula]

where qi and pi are forms of degree i. Let P be the pencil on X that is cut out by

[formula]

where [formula]. Then P is a  Halphen pencil if q2(0,y,z,t)  ≠  0 by [\cite=ChPa05h].

The purpose of this paper is to prove the following result.

Let M be a Halphen pencil on X. Then

either M is cut out on X by the pencil

[formula]

where l1 and l2 are linearly independent linear forms, and [formula],

or the threefold X can be given by the equation

[formula]

such that q2(0,y,z,t)  ≠  0, and M is cut out on the threefold X by the pencil

[formula]

where qi and pi are forms of degree i, and [formula].

Let P be an arbitrary point of the quartic hypersurface [formula].

The mobility threshold of the  threefold X at the point P is the number

[formula]

where π:Y  →  X is the ordinary blow up of P, and E is the exceptional divisor of π.

Arguing as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main], we obtain the following result.

The following conditions are equivalent:

the equality ι(P) = 2 holds,

the threefold X can be given by the equation

[formula]

where qi and pi are forms of degree i such that

[formula]

and P is given by the equations x = y = z = t = 0.

One can easily check that [formula]. Similarly, one can show that

ι(P) = 1 [formula] the hyperplane section of X that is singular at P is a cone,

ι(P) = 3 / 2 [formula] the threefold X contains no lines passing through P.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main] is completed on board of IL-96-300 Valery Chkalov while flying from Seoul to Moscow. We thank Aeroflot Russian Airlines for good working conditions.

Important lemma

Let S be a surface, let O be a smooth point of S, let R be an effective Weil divisor on the surface S, and let D be a linear system on the  surface S that has no fixed components.

Let D1 and D2 be general curves in D. Then

[formula]

Put S0 = S and O0 = O. Let us consider the sequence of blow ups

[formula]

such that π1 is a blow up of the point O0, and πi is a blow up of the point Oi - 1 that is contained in the curve Ei - 1, where Ei - 1 is the exceptional curve of πi - 1, and [formula].

Let Dij be the proper transform of Dj on Si for [formula] and j = 1,2. Then

[formula]

for [formula]. Put [formula] for [formula].

Let Ri be the proper transform of R on the surface Si for [formula]. Then

[formula]

for [formula]. Put [formula] for [formula]. Then [formula].

We may chose the blow ups [formula] in a way such that [formula] is empty in the neighborhood of the exceptional locus of [formula]. Then

[formula]

We may chose the blow ups [formula] in a way such that [formula] and [formula] are empty in the neighborhood of the exceptional locus of [formula]. Then

[formula]

where some numbers among [formula] may be zero. Then

[formula]

because [formula] and [formula] for every [formula].

The assertion of Lemma [\ref=lemma:cornerstone] is a cornerstone of the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main].

Curves

Let X be a smooth quartic threefold in [formula], let M be a Halphen pencil on X. Then

[formula]

since [formula]. Put μ = 1 / n. Then

the log pair (X,μM) is canonical by [\cite=Isk01],

the log pair (X,μM) is not terminal by [\cite=ChPa05h].

Let [formula] be the set of non-terminal centers of (X,μM) (see [\cite=ChPa05h]). Then

[formula]

because (X,μM) is not terminal. Let M1 and M2 be two general surfaces in M.

Suppose that [formula] contains a point P∈X. Then

[formula]

where M is any surface in M, and T is the surface in | - KX| that is singular at P.

It follows from [\cite=Pu98a] that the inequality

[formula]

holds. Let H be a general surface in | - KX| such that P∈H. Then

[formula]

which gives (M1  ·  M2)P = 4n2. Arguing as in the proof of [\cite=Pu98a], we see that

[formula]

because (M1  ·  M2)P = 4n2. Similarly, we see that

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. Finally, we also have

[formula]

where M is any surface in M, which completes the  proof.

Suppose that [formula] contains a point P∈X. Then

[formula]

where [formula] are lines on the threefold X that pass through the point P.

Let H be a general surface in | - KX| such that P∈H. Then

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=lemma:4n-square]. Then [formula] consists of lines on X that pass through P.

Suppose that [formula] contains a point P∈X. Then

[formula]

for every line L  ⊂  X that passes through the point P.

Let D be a general hyperplane section of X through L. Then we have

[formula]

where M is a general surface in M and Δ is an  effective divisor such that

[formula]

On the surface D we have L  ·  L =  - 2. Then

[formula]

on the surface D. But [formula]. Thus, we get

[formula]

which implies that [formula].

Let T be the surface in | - KX| that is singular at P. Then T  ·  D is reduced and

[formula]

where Z is an irreducible plane cubic curve such that P∈Z. Then

[formula]

on the surface D. The set [formula] is finite by Lemma [\ref=lemma:point-CS-lines]. In particular, we have

[formula]

because [formula] does not contain the curve Z. Thus, we get

[formula]

which implies that [formula].

In the rest of this section we prove the following result.

Suppose that [formula] contains a curve. Then n = 1.

Suppose that [formula] contains a curve Z. Then it follows Lemmas [\ref=lemma:point-CS-lines] and [\ref=lemma:lines-inequalities] that the set [formula] does not contain points of the threefold X and

[formula]

because (X,μM) is canonical but not terminal. Then [formula] by [\cite=ChPa05h].

Suppose that [formula]. Then n  =  1.

Let π:V  →  X be the blow up of X along the line Z. Let B be the proper transform of the pencil M on the threefold V, and let B be a general surface in B. Then

[formula]

by [\eqref=mult-of-M]. There is a commutative diagram

[formula]

where ψ is the projection from the line Z and η is the  morphism induced by the linear system | - KV|. Thus, it follows from [\eqref=mult-of-B] that B is the pull-back of a pencil P on [formula] by η.

We see that the base locus of B is contained in the union of fibers of η.

The set [formula] is not empty by [\cite=ChPa05h]. It easily follows from [\eqref=mult-of-M] that the set [formula] does not contain points because [formula] contains no points.

We see that there is an irreducible curve L  ⊂  V such that

[formula]

and η(L) is a point [formula]. Let C be a general curve in P. Then [formula]. But

[formula]

by [\eqref=mult-of-B]. Thus, we see that n = 1, because general surface in M is irreducible.

Thus, we may assume that the set [formula] does not contain lines.

The curve [formula] is contained in a plane.

Suppose that Z is not contained in any plane in [formula]. Let us show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. Since [formula], we have

[formula]

and Z is smooth if [formula]. If [formula], then Z may have at most one double point.

Suppose that Z is smooth. Let α:U  →  X be the blow up at Z, and let F be the exceptional divisor of the morphism α. Then the base locus of the linear system

[formula]

does not contain any curve. Let D1 and D2 be the proper transforms on U of two sufficiently general surfaces in the linear system M. Then it follows from [\eqref=mult-of-M] that

[formula]

because the cycle D1  ·  D2 is effective. On the other hand, we have

[formula]

which is a contradiction. Thus, the curve Z is not smooth.

Thus, we see that Z is a quartic curve with a double point O.

Let β:W  →  X be the composition of the blow up of the point O with the blow up of the proper transform of the curve Z. Let G and E be the exceptional surfaces of the morphism β such that β(E) = Z and β(G) = O. Then the base locus of the linear system

[formula]

does not contain any curve. Let R1 and R2 be the proper transforms on W of two sufficiently general surfaces in M. Put [formula]. Then it follows from [\eqref=mult-of-M] that

[formula]

and m < 2n, because the set [formula] does not contain points. Then

[formula]

which is a contradiction.

If [formula], then n = 1 by Lemma [\ref=lemma:plane-curve] and [\cite=ChPa05h].

Suppose that [formula]. Then n = 1.

Let P be the pencil in | - KX| that contains all hyperplane sections of X that pass through the curve Z. Then the base locus of P consists of the curve Z and a line L  ⊂  X.

Let D be a sufficiently general surface in the pencil P, and let M be a sufficiently general surface in the pencil M. Then D is a smooth surface, and

[formula]

where B is a curve whose support does not contain neither Z nor L.

On the surface D, we have Z  ·  L = 3 and L  ·  L =  - 2. Intersecting [\eqref=on-D] with L, we get

[formula]

which easily implies that [formula]. But the inequality [formula] is impossible, because we assumed that [formula] contains no lines.

Suppose that [formula]. Then n = 1.

Let α:U  →  X be the blow up of the curve Z. Then | - KU| is a pencil, whose base locus consists of a smooth irreducible curve L  ⊂  U.

Let D be a general surface in | - KU|. Then D is a smooth surface.

Let B be the proper transform of the pencil M on the threefold U. Then

[formula]

where B is a general surface in B. But L2  =   - 2 on the surface D. Then

[formula]

which implies that [formula] by [\cite=ChPa05h]. Then n = 1.

The assertion of Proposition [\ref=proposition:curves] is proved.

Points

Let X be a smooth quartic threefold in [formula], let M be a Halphen pencil on X. Then

[formula]

since [formula]. Put μ = 1 / n. Then

the log pair (X,μM) is canonical by [\cite=Isk01],

the log pair (X,μM) is not terminal by [\cite=ChPa05h].

To prove Theorem [\ref=theorem:main], it is enough to show that X can be given by

[formula]

where qi and pi are homogeneous polynomials of degree [formula] such that q2(0,y,z,t)  ≠  0.

Let [formula] be the set of non-terminal centers of (X,μM) (see [\cite=ChPa05h]). Then

[formula]

because (X,μM) is not terminal. Suppose that n  ≠  1. There is a point P∈X such that

[formula]

by Proposition [\ref=proposition:curves]. It follows from Lemmas [\ref=lemma:4n-square], [\ref=lemma:point-CS-lines] and [\ref=lemma:lines-inequalities] that

there are finitely many distinct lines [formula] containing P∈X,

the equality [formula] holds, and

[formula]

where M is a general surface in the pencil M,

the equality [formula] holds, where T∈| - KX| such that [formula],

the base locus of the pencil M consists of the lines [formula], and

[formula]

where M1 and M2 are sufficiently general surfaces in M.

The equality [formula] holds.

The set [formula] does not contain curves by Proposition [\ref=proposition:curves].

Suppose that [formula] contains a point Q∈X such that Q  ≠  P. Then r = 1.

Let D be a general hyperplane section of X that passes through L1. Then

[formula]

where M is a general surface in M and Δ is an  effective divisor such that

[formula]

On the surface D, we have L21 =  - 2. Then

[formula]

which gives [formula]. But [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lemma:lines-inequalities].

The quartic threefold X can be given by an equation

[formula]

where qi is a homogeneous polynomial of degree [formula].

The lines [formula] are given by the  equations

[formula]

the surface T is cut out on X by x = 0, and [formula].

Let π:V  →  X be the blow up of the point P, let E be the π-exceptional divisor. Then

[formula]

where B is the proper transform of the pencil M on the threefold V.

The pencil B has no base curves in E, because

[formula]

Let i be the proper transform of the line Li on the threefold V for [formula]. Then

[formula]

where B1 and B2 are proper transforms of M1 and M2 on the threefold V, respectively.

Let Z be an irreducible curve on X such that [formula]. Then

[formula]

and the equality [formula] implies that

[formula]

where [formula] is a proper transform of the curve Z on the  threefold V.

The curve [formula] is not contained in the base locus of the pencil B. Then

[formula]

which implies the required assertions.

To conclude the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main], it is enough to show that

[formula]

where p1 and p2 are some homogeneous polynomials of degree 1 and 2, respectively.

Good points

Let us use the assumptions and notation of Section [\ref=section:general-quartic]. Suppose that the conic

[formula]

is reduced and irreducible. In this section we prove the following result.

The polynomial q3(0,y,z,t) is divisible by q2(0,y,z,t).

Let us prove Proposition [\ref=proposition:good-points]. Suppose that q3(0,y,z,t) is not divisible by q2(0,y,z,t).

Let R be the linear system on the threefold X that is cut out by quadrics

[formula]

where h1 is an arbitrary linear form and [formula]. Then R does not have fixed components.

Let R1 and R2 be general surfaces in the linear system R. Then

[formula]

We may assume that R1 is cut out by the equation

[formula]

and R2 is cut out by xh1(x,y,z,t) = 0, where h1 is sufficiently general. Then

[formula]

Put [formula]. Then

[formula]

where [formula], and Δ is a cycle, whose support contains no lines passing through P.

Let 1 and [formula] be the proper transforms of R1 and T on V, respectively. Then

[formula]

where Ω is an effective cycle, whose support contains no lines passing through P.

The support of the cycle Ω does not contain curves that are contained in the exceptional divisor E, because q3(0,y,z,t) is not divisible by q2(0,y,z,t) by our assumption. Then

[formula]

which is exactly what we want.

Let M and R be general surfaces in M and R, respectively. Put

[formula]

where [formula], and Δ is a cycle, whose support contains no lines passing through P.

The cycle Δ is not trivial.

Suppose that Δ = 0. Then M  =  R by [\cite=ChPa05h]. But R is not a pencil.

We have [formula]. On the  other hand, the inequality

[formula]

holds, because [formula] and [formula]. It follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:curves-2mult-deg] that

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. But it follows from Lemmas [\ref=lemma:cornerstone] and [\ref=lemma:lines-inequalities] that

[formula]

for every [formula], where R1 and R2 are general surfaces in R. Then

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=lemma:ODP-2H-3E], which is a contradiction.

The assertion of Proposition [\ref=proposition:good-points] is proved.

Bad points

Let us use the assumptions and notation of Section [\ref=section:general-quartic]. Suppose that the conic

[formula]

is reduced and reducible. Therefore, we have

[formula]

where p1(x,y,z,t) is a linear form, and [formula].

The polynomial q3(0,y,z,t) is divisible by q2(0,y,z,t).

Suppose that q3(0,y,z,t) is not divisible by q2(0,y,z,t). Then without loss of generality, we may assume that q3(0,y,z,t) is not divisible by α1y + β1z + γ1t.

Let Z be the curve in X that is cut out by the equations

[formula]

The equality [formula] holds, but Z is not necessary reduced.

Hence, it follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:curves-2mult-deg] that [formula] contains a line among [formula].

The support of the curve Z does not contain an irreducible conic.

Suppose that [formula] contains an irreducible conic C. Then

[formula]

for some [formula]. Then i = j, because otherwise the set

[formula]

contains a point that is different from P, which is impossible by Lemma [\ref=lemma:curves-2mult-deg]. We see that

[formula]

and it follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:curves-2mult-deg] that [formula]. Then C is tangent to Li at the point P

Let [formula] be a proper transform of the curve C on the  threefold V. Then

[formula]

which is impossible by Lemma [\ref=lemma:curves-2mult-deg]. The assertion is proved.

The support of the curve Z consists of lines.

Suppose that [formula] does not consist of lines. It follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:bad-points-no-conics] that

[formula]

where C is an irreducible cubic curve. But [formula]. Then

[formula]

which is impossible by Lemma [\ref=lemma:curves-2mult-deg]

We may assume that there is a line L  ⊂  X such that [formula] and

[formula]

where [formula] such that [formula] and [formula].

We have Li  ≠  Lj whenever i  ≠  j.

Let H be a sufficiently general surface of X that is cut out by the equation

[formula]

where [formula]. Then H has at most isolated singularities.

The surface H is smooth at the points P and [formula], where [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula] be the proper transforms of H and L on the  threefold V, respectively.

The inequality k  ≠  3 holds.

Suppose that the equality k = 3 holds. Then H is smooth. Put

[formula]

where B is a general surface in B, and Ω is an effective divisor on [formula] whose support does not contain any of the curves 1, 2 and 3. Then

[formula]

because the base locus of the pencil B consists of the curves [formula]. Then

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. On the other hand, we have

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. Thus, we have m1 = m2 = m3 = n / 3 and

[formula]

which implies that [formula].

Let [formula] be another general surface in B. Arguing as above, we see that

[formula]

where [formula] is an effective divisor on the surface [formula] such that

[formula]

One can easily check that [formula]. Then

[formula]

because [formula] due to generality of the surfaces B and [formula].

The base locus of the pencil B consists of the curves [formula]. Hence, we have

[formula]

but [formula] whenever [formula]. Hence, we have

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. In particular, we see that

[formula]

because [formula]. But [formula] for i = 1,2,3.

The inequality k  ≠  2 holds.

Suppose that the equality k = 2 holds. Then Z = 2L1 + L2 + L. Put

[formula]

where B is a general surface in B, and Ω is an effective divisor on [formula] whose support does not contain the curves 1 and 2. Then [formula] and

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. On the other hand, we have

[formula]

where [formula] is the proper transform of the surface T on the  threefold V. Then

[formula]

which implies that 1  ·  1 =  - 3 / 2 on the  surface [formula]. Then

[formula]

which gives [formula]. Similarly, we see that 2  ·  2 =  - 3 on the surface [formula]. Then

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. Thus, we have m1 = 2m2 = 2n / 3 and

[formula]

which implies that [formula].

Let [formula] be another general surface in B. Arguing as above, we see that

[formula]

where [formula] is an effective divisor on [formula] whose support does not contain 1 and 2 such that

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. In particular, we see that

[formula]

and arguing as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma:bad-points-3-lines] we obtain a contradiction.

It follows from Lemmas [\ref=lemma:bad-points-3-lines] and [\ref=lemma:bad-points-2-lines] that Z = 3L1 + L. Put

[formula]

where B is a general surface in B, and Ω is a curve such that [formula]. Then

[formula]

because the base locus of B consists of the curves [formula]. Then

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. On the other hand, we have

[formula]

where [formula] is the proper transform of the surface T on the  threefold V. Then

[formula]

which implies that 1  ·  1 =  - 1 on the surface [formula]. Then

[formula]

which gives [formula]. Thus, we have m1 = n and Ω  ·    =  Ω  ·  1 = 0. Then [formula].

Let [formula] be another general surface in B. Arguing as above, we see that

[formula]

where [formula] is an effective divisor on [formula] whose support does not contain 1 such that

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. In particular, we see that [formula].

The base locus of the pencil B consists of the curves [formula]. Hence, we have

[formula]

but [formula] whenever i  ≠  1. Then [formula], because

[formula]

which is a contradiction. The assertion of Proposition [\ref=proposition:bad-points] is proved.

Very bad points

Let us use the assumptions and notation of Section [\ref=section:general-quartic]. Suppose that q2 = y2.

The proof of Proposition 6.1 implies that q3(0,y,z,t) is divisible by y. Then

[formula]

where a1, b1, c1 are linear forms, f2 and h2 is are homogeneous polynomials of degree two.

The equality f2(z,t) = 0 holds.

Let us prove Proposition [\ref=proposition:very-bad-points] by reductio ad absurdum. Suppose that f2(z,t)  ≠  0.

By choosing suitable coordinates, we may assume that f2 = zt or f2 = z2.

We must use smoothness of the threefold X by analyzing the shape of q4. We have

[formula]

where a2, b2, c2 are homogeneous polynomials of degree two, u3 and v3 are homogeneous polynomials of degree three, and f4 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree four.

Suppose that f2(z,t) = zt and

[formula]

for some [formula]. Then v3(z,0)  ≠  0.

Suppose that v3(z,0) = 0. The surface T is given by the equation

[formula]

because T is cut out on X by the equation x = 0. Then T has non-isolated singularity along the line x = y = t = 0, which is impossible because X is smooth.

Arguing as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma:very-bad-points-derivatives], we obtain the following corollary.

Suppose that f2(z,t) = zt and

[formula]

for some [formula]. Then v3(0,t)  ≠  0.

Suppose that f2(z,t) = zt. Then f4(0,t) = f4(z,0) = 0.

We may assume that f4(z,0)  ≠  0. Let H be the linear system on X that is cut out by

[formula]

where [formula]. Then the base locus of H consists of the point P.

Let R be a proper transform of H on the threefold V. Then the base locus of R consists of a single point that is not contained in any of the curves [formula].

The linear system R|B has not base points, where B is a general surface in B. But

[formula]

where R is a general surface in R. Then R|B is not composed from a pencil, which implies that the curve R  ·  B is irreducible and reduced by the Bertini theorem.

Let H and M be general surfaces in H and M, respectively. Then M  ·  H is irreducible and reduced. Thus, the linear system M|H is a pencil.

The surface H contains no lines passing through P, and H can be given by

[formula]

where li(x,y,z) is a homogeneous polynomials of degree i.

Arguing as in Example [\ref=example:Iskovskikh], we see that there is a pencil Q on the surface H such that

[formula]

general curve in Q is irreducible, and [formula]. Arguing as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma:4n-square], we see that M|H  =  Q by [\cite=ChPa05h]. Let M be a general surface in M. Then

[formula]

and [formula]. The surface M is cut out on X by an equation

[formula]

where Ai and Bi are homogeneous polynomials of degree i, and [formula].

It follows from [formula] that B1(y,z,t) = B0 = 0.

The coordinated (y,z,t) are also local coordinates on X near the point P. Then

[formula]

which is a Taylor power series for x = x(y,z,t), where p1(y,z,t) is a linear form.

The surface M is locally given by the analytic equation

[formula]

and [formula]. Hence, we see that B2(y,z,t) = A0y2 and

[formula]

which implies that A0 = A1(y,z,t) = B2(y,z,t) = 0. Hence, we see that a general surface in the pencil M is cut out on X by the equation x2 = 0, which is a absurd.

Arguing as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma:very-bad-points-f4], we obtain the following corollary.

Suppose that f2(z,t) = z2. Then f4(0,t) = 0.

Let R be the linear system on the threefold X that is cut out by cubics

[formula]

where h2 is a form of degree 2, and [formula]. Then R has no fixed components.

Let M and R be general surfaces in M and R, respectively. Put

[formula]

where [formula], and Δ is a cycle, whose support contains no lines among [formula].

The cycle Δ is not trivial.

Suppose that Δ = 0. Then M  =  R by [\cite=ChPa05h]. But R is not a pencil.

We have [formula], because [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=lemma:curves-2mult-deg], because [formula] does not contain any of the lines [formula].

The inequality [formula] holds.

Let R1 and R2 be general surfaces in the linear system R. Then

[formula]

for every [formula] by Lemmas [\ref=lemma:cornerstone] and [\ref=lemma:lines-inequalities]. Then

[formula]

The inequality [formula] holds.

Now we suppose that R1 is cut out on the quartic X by the  equation

[formula]

and R2 is cut out by [formula], where h2 is sufficiently general. Then

[formula]

where T is the hyperplane section of the hypersurface X that is cut out by x = 0. But

[formula]

where Z1 and Z2 are cycles on X such that Z1 is cut out by x = y = 0, and Z2 is cut out by

[formula]

The equality [formula] holds.

The lines [formula] are given by the equations

[formula]

which implies that [formula].

Hence, we see that [formula]. But Z2 can be considered as a cycle

[formula]

and, putting u = w + c1(y,z,t), we see that Z2 can be considered as a cycle

[formula]

and we can consider the set of lines [formula] as the set in [formula] given by y = f4(z,t) = 0.

The inequality f2(z,t)  ≠  zt holds.

Suppose that f2(z,t) = zt. Then it follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:very-bad-points-f4] that

[formula]

for some [formula]. Then Z2 can be given by

[formula]

which implies Z2 = Z12 + Z22, where Z12 and Z22 are cycles in [formula] such that Z12 is given by

[formula]

and Z22 is given by uy + zt = v3(z,t) + yc2(y,z,t) - u(α1z + β1t)(α2z + β2t) = 0.

We may assume that L1 is given by y = z = 0, and L2 is given by y = t = 0. Then

[formula]

which implies that [formula].

Suppose that r = 4. Then α1  ≠  0, β1  ≠  0, α2  ≠  0, β2  ≠  0. Hence, we see that

[formula]

because v3(z,t) + yc2(y,z,t) - u(α1z + β1t)(α2z + β2t) does not vanish on L1 and L2. But

[formula]

because zt does not vanish on L3 and L4. Then [formula], which is impossible.

Suppose that r = 3. We may assume that (α1,β1) = (1,0), but α2  ≠  0  ≠  β2. Then

[formula]

because v3(z,t) + yc2(y,z,t) - uz(α2z + β2t) does not vanish on L2. We have

[formula]

which implies that v3(0,t)  ≠  0 by Corollary [\ref=corollary:very-bad-points-derivatives]. Hence, wee see that

[formula]

because v3(z,t) + yc2(y,z,t) - uz(α2z + β2t) and zt do not vanish on L1 and L3, respectively, which implies that [formula]. The latter is a contradiction.

We see that r = 2. We may assume that (α1,β1) = (1,0), and either α2 = 0 or β2 = 0.

Suppose that α2 = 0. Then f4(z,t) = β2z2t2. By Lemma [\ref=lemma:very-bad-points-derivatives] and Corollary [\ref=corollary:very-bad-points-derivatives], we get

[formula]

which implies that v3(z,t) + yc2(y,z,t) - β2zt does not vanish on neither L1 nor L2. Then

[formula]

which implies that [formula], which is a contradiction.

We see that α2  ≠  0 and β2 = 0. We have f4(z,t) = α2z3t. Then

[formula]

by Corollary [\ref=corollary:very-bad-points-derivatives]. Then [formula] because the polynomial

[formula]

does not vanish on L1.

The line L2 is given by the equations y = t = 0. But Z2 is given by the equations

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. Then [formula], which is a contradiction.

Therefore, we see that f2(z,t) = z2. It follows from Corollary [\ref=corollary:very-bad-points-f4] that

[formula]

for some [formula]. We may assume that L1 is given by y = z = 0.

The equality g3(0,t) = 0 holds.

Suppose that g3(0,t)  ≠  0. Then [formula], because Z2 is given by

[formula]

and the lines [formula] are given by the equations y = g3(z,t) = 0.

The cycle Z2 + L1 is given by the equations

[formula]

which implies that the cycle Z2 + L1 can be given by the  equations

[formula]

We have Z2 + L1 = C1 + C2, where C1 and C2 are cycles in [formula] such that C1 is given by

[formula]

and the cycle C2 is given by the equations

[formula]

We have C1 = 2L2. But [formula] because the polynomial

[formula]

does not vanish on L1, because g3(0,t)  ≠  0. Then

[formula]

which implies that Z2 = L1. Then [formula], which is a  contradiction.

Thus, we see that [formula] and

[formula]

for some [formula]. Then

[formula]

by Corollary [\ref=corollary:very-bad-points-derivatives]. But Z2 can be given by the equations

[formula]

which implies Z2 = Z12 + Z22, where Z12 and Z22 are cycles on [formula] such that Z12 is given by

[formula]

and the cycle Z22 is given by the equations

[formula]

which implies that Z12 = 2L1. Thus, we see that [formula].

The inequality r  ≠  3 holds.

Suppose that r = 3. Then β1  ≠  0  ≠  β2, which implies that

[formula]

because v3(z,t) + yc2(y,z,t) - u(α1z + β1t)(α2z + β2t) does not vanish on L1. But

[formula]

because β1  ≠  0  ≠  β2. Then [formula], which is a  contradiction.

Thus, we see that either r = 1 or r = 2.

The inequality r  ≠  2 holds.

Suppose that r = 2. We may assume that

either β1  ≠  0 = β2,

or α1  =  α2 and β1  =  β2  ≠  0.

Suppose that β2 = 0. Then f4(z,t) = α2z3(α1z + β1t) and

[formula]

because v3(z,t) + yc2(y,z,t) - α2uz(α1z + β2t) does not vanish on L1. But L2 is given by

[formula]

which implies that z2 does not vanish on L2, because β1  ≠  0. Then

[formula]

which implies that [formula], which is a contradiction.

Hence, we see that α1  =  α2 and β1  =  β2  ≠  0. Then [formula], because

[formula]

does not vanish on L1. But [formula], because z2 does not vanish on L2. Then

[formula]

which is a contradiction.

We see that f4(z,t) = z2 and f4(z,t) = μz4 for some [formula]. Then Z22 is given by

[formula]

where v3(0,t)  ≠  0 by Corollary [\ref=corollary:very-bad-points-derivatives]. Thus, we see that [formula], because

[formula]

does not vanish on L1. Then [formula], which is a contradiction.

The assertion of Proposition [\ref=proposition:very-bad-points] is proved.

The assertion of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main] follows from Propositions [\ref=proposition:curves], [\ref=proposition:good-points], [\ref=proposition:bad-points], [\ref=proposition:very-bad-points].
