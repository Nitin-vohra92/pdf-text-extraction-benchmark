Shell-model studies on exotic nuclei around 132Sn

Introduction

The region of nuclei around doubly-magic 132Sn is currently a subject of a certain theoretical and experimental interest. New advanced facilities and techniques, such as the advent of radioactive ion beams, allow to access to new data [\cite=Radford02] [\cite=Shergur05a] [\cite=Shergur05b], that give the opportunity to test theoretical models.

In particular, it is important to study in this region, by way of microscopic approaches, the possible evolution of shell structure when going toward proton or neutron drip lines [\cite=Otsuka04] [\cite=Otsuka05]. In fact, recent works evidence that in N = 82 isotones the so-called "shell-quenching" phenomenon seems to play a fundamental role to reproduce the solar system r - process abudances ([formula]) [\cite=Dillmann03]. This is stimulating shell-model studies in this region, focusing particular attention on the two-body matrix elements (TBME) of the residual interaction.

In recent years, the derivation of the shell-model TBME from realistic nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials has proved to be a reliable approach to microscopic shell-model calculations [\cite=Kartamyshev06] [\cite=Covello07]. The success achieved by these calculations in different mass regions gives a clearcut answer to the long-standing problem of how accurate description of nuclear structure properties can be provided by realistic shell-model interactions, and opens the way to a more fundamental approach to the nuclear shell model than the traditional one, which makes use of empirical TBME with several parameters.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we give a short description of how the short-range repulsion of a realistic NN potential is renormalized before to be employed in the derivation of the effective shell-model interaction. In particular, we will focus attention on a recent approach, the so-called Vlow - k one [\cite=Bogner02], that allows to derive a low-momentum NN realistic potential which preserves exactly the onshell physics of the original potential. In Sec. III a summary of the derivation of the shell-model effective hamiltonian Heff is presented with some details of our calculations. In Sec. IV we present and discuss results obtained employing realistic shell-model interactions for nuclei with valence nucleons outside the doubly-magic 132Sn core. Some concluding remarks are given in Sec. V.

The renormalization of the short-range repulsion

Because of the strong repulsive core in the short-range region, which is a feature common to all modern NN potentials, the latter cannot be used directly in the derivation of shell-model effective interaction within a perturbative approach, that is the standard procedure. So, as mentioned before, realistic potentials have to be renormalized first. The standard way to renormalize the short-range repulsion is to resort to the theory of the Brueckner reaction matrix G, that provides to sum up the infinite series of ladder diagrams whose interaction vertices are the NN interaction itself. The G matrix is defined [\cite=Krenciglowa76] by the integral equation:

[formula]

where VNN represents the NN potential, T denotes the two-nucleon kinetic energy, and ω is an energy variable (the so-called starting energy), given by the energy of the in-coming nucleons. The two-body Pauli exclusion operator Q2p prevents double counting, namely the intermediate states allowed for G must be outside of the chosen model space. Thus the Pauli operator Q2p is dependent on the model space, and so is the G matrix.

Inspired by the effective theory, an alternative approach based on the renormalization group (RG) has been recently introduced to renormalize the short-range repulsion introducing a cutoff momentum Λ, that decouples the fast and slow modes of the original VNN.

Let us now outline briefly the derivation of this low-momentum potential Vlow - k [\cite=Bogner02]. The repulsive core contained in VNN is smoothed by integrating out the high-momentum modes of VNN down to Λ. This integration is carried out with the requirement that the deuteron binding energy and low-energy phase shifts of VNN are preserved by Vlow - k. This is achieved by the following T-matrix equivalence approach. We start from the half-on-shell T matrix for VNN

[formula]

where P denotes the principal value and k, ~ k', and q stand for the relative momenta. The effective low-momentum T matrix is then defined by

[formula]

where the intermediate state momentum q is integrated from 0 to the momentum space cutoff Λ and (p',p)  ≤  Λ. The above T matrices are required to satisfy the condition

[formula]

The above equations define the effective low-momentum interaction Vlow - k, and it has been shown [\cite=Bogner02] that they are satisfied by the solution:

[formula]

which is the well known Kuo-Lee-Ratcliff (KLR) folded-diagram expansion [\cite=Kuo71] [\cite=Kuo90], originally designed for constructing shell-model effective interactions. In Eq. ([\ref=vlowk]) [formula] is an irreducible vertex function whose intermediate states are all beyond Λ and ' is obtained by removing from [formula] its terms first order in the interaction VNN. In addition to the preservation of the half-on-shell T matrix, which implies preservation of the phase shifts, this Vlow - k preserves the deuteron binding energy, since eigenvalues are preserved by the KLR effective interaction. For any value of Λ, the low-momentum potential of Eq. ([\ref=vlowk]) can be calculated very accurately using iteration methods. Our calculation of Vlow - k is performed by employing the iteration method proposed in [\cite=Andreozzi96], which is based on the Lee-Suzuki similarity transformation [\cite=Suzuki80].

The main result is that Vlow - k is a smooth potential which preserves exactly the onshell properties of the original VNN, and is suitable to be used directly in nuclear structure calculations. In the past few years, Vlow - k has been fruitfully employed in microscopic calculations within different perturbative frameworks such as the realistic shell model [\cite=Coraggio02] [\cite=Coraggio04] [\cite=Coraggio05a] [\cite=Coraggio06a], the Goldstone expansion for doubly closed-shell nuclei [\cite=Coraggio03] [\cite=Coraggio05b] [\cite=Coraggio06b], and the Hartree-Fock theory for nuclear matter calculations [\cite=Sedrakian03] [\cite=Bogner05].

The derivation of the shell-model effective potential

In the framework of the shell model, an auxiliary one-body potential U is introduced in order to break up the nuclear hamiltonian as the sum of a one-body component H0, which describes the independent motion of the nucleons, and a residual interaction H1:

[formula]

Once H0 has been introduced, a reduced model space is defined in terms of a finite subset of H0's eigenvectors. The diagonalization of the many-body hamiltonian ([\ref=smham]) in an infinite Hilbert space, that is obviously unfeasible, is then reduced to the solution of an eigenvalue problem for an effective hamiltonian Heff in a finite space.

The standard approach is to derive Heff by way of the time-dependent perturbation theory [\cite=Kuo71] [\cite=Kuo90]. Namely, Heff is expressed through the KLR folded-diagram expansion in terms of the vertex function [formula]-box, which is composed of irreducible valence-linked diagrams. The [formula]-box is composed of one- and two-body Goldstone diagrams through a certain order in V [\cite=Kuo81], where V is the renormalized input potential. Once the [formula]-box has been calculated, the series of the folded diagrams is summed up to all orders using the Lee-Suzuki iteration method [\cite=Suzuki80].

The hamiltonian Heff contains one-body contributions, which represent the effective single-particle (SP) energies. In realistic shell-model calculations it is customary to use a subtraction procedure [\cite=Shurpin83] so that only the two-body terms of Heff are retained - the effective interaction Veff - and the SP energies are taken from the experimental data. This is what has also been done in the calculations reported in the following section. The single-proton and single-neutron energies have been taken from the experimental spectra of 133Sb and 133Sn [\cite=nndc], that can be described just as one proton and one neutron diving in the mean field generated by the 132Sn doubly-closed core. For sake of completeness, it is important to mention that experimentally the proton 2s1 / 2 level is missing and the neutron 0i13 / 2 level is unbound. The analysis of the first excited Jπ = 10+ in 134Sb allows to estimate the SP energy of neutron 0i13 / 2 level to be 2.694  ±  0.2 MeV [\cite=Urban99], while a study of odd N = 82 isotones suggests that the SP proton 2s1 / 2 level should lie around 2.8 MeV excitation energy [\cite=Andreozzi97].

Realistic shell-model calculations

Here, we present some selected results employing realistic shell-model Veffs for nuclei with valence nucleons outside 132Sn core. The Veffs are derived from the CD-Bonn realistic NN potential [\cite=Machleidt01] using as renormalization approach both the G-matrix and the Vlow - k ones. Calculations employing a G-matrix derived from the CD-Bonn potential have been widely performed by the Oslo group and their coworkers [\cite=Shergur05a] [\cite=Shergur05b] [\cite=Kartamyshev06] [\cite=Shergur02] [\cite=Brown05] with a remarkable success. The Veff is derived within the folded-diagram approach described in section [\ref=effint], including in the [formula]-box diagrams up to the third order in G and intermediate states with at most 2ω excitation energy [\cite=Hjorth96].

The region of nuclei around 132Sn core has beeen studied in recent years also by the Naples-Stony Brook group within the framework of the Vlow - k renormalization procedure. In such a case, the shell-model effective interaction is obtained starting from a Vlow - k derived from the CD-Bonn potential, with a cutoff momentum Λ = 2.2 fm- 1, that is a value able to preserve all the two-nucleon physics of the original potential up to the anelastic threshold and small enough so to give a reasonably smooth potential. Then the [formula]-box has been calculated including diagrams up to second order in Vlow - k using intermediate states composed of all possible hole states and particle states restricted to the five shells above the 132Sn Fermi surface. This guarantees the stability of the Veff TBME when increasing the number of intermediate particle states.

In both approaches an harmonic-oscillator basis with an oscillator parameter ω = 7.88 MeV has been employed.

Let us now come to the results of the calculations and their comparison with experimental data.

First, it is worth to point out that a fundamental test for the reliability of the matrix elements of Veff are the systems with two valence nucleons outside di closed-shell core. In the present case, the test is the reproduction of the spectra of 134Te - two protons outside 132Sn - 134Sn, and 134Sb, that are two neutrons and one proton and one neutron outside 132Sn, respectively.

In Tables [\ref=134te],[\ref=134sn],[\ref=134sb] the experimental and theoretical low-lying spectra of 134Te, 134Sn, 134Sb are reported.

From the inspection of Tables [\ref=134te],[\ref=134sn], it is evident that the agreement between theory and experiment is very good for the identical particle channel, both with G-matrix and Vlow - k approach. It is worth to note that theoretical results do not differ so much when using the two different renormalization procedures.

The study of 134Sb low-lying spectrum evidences a differ situation respect the identical-particle case. A less better agreement with experimental data is obtained employing the Veff TBME derived with the G-matrix approach. This deficiency is also propagated in the theoretical spectrum of 135Sb obtained with G-matrix renormalization procedure, as it can be seen in Table [\ref=135sb]. In Ref.[\cite=Shergur05b], in order to obtain a better agreement with experimental spectrum of 135Sb, it was pointed out that a downshift of the proton d5 / 2 level with respect to the g7 / 2 one by 300 keV, as a possible collective influence of a neutron skin [\cite=Shergur02], turned out to be necessary, but did not help for 134Sb [\cite=Shergur02] [\cite=Shergur05a].

We have verified that the differences between the results obtained with G-matrix and those with Vlow - k, that are in quite good agreement with experiment, should be traced mainly to the different dimension of the intermediate state space. In fact, it has been found that including intermediate states only up to 2ω excitation energy in the calculation of the second-order [formula]-box, with the Vlow - k as input potential, the results become similar, as in the case of the identical-particle channel.

This confirms the fact that results do not depend so much on the renormalization technique. However, it is worth to note that, because Vlow - k does not depend on the Pauli-blocking operator Q as the G-matrix, using Vlow - k one can easily employ a larger number of intermediate states and obtaining consequently better results.

Concluding remarks

Here, we have presented selected results of some shell-model studies of nuclei with valence-nucleons outside doubly-closed shell core 132Sn, where realistic effective shell-model interactions have been employed. In particular, we have focused the attention on few valence-nucleons nuclei which are most appropriate for a stringent test of the two-body matrix elements. The latter have been derived by means of a [formula]-box folded-diagram method from the CD-Bonn potential, renormalized both by use of the G-matrix and Vlow - k approaches. Results are in a good agreement with experiment and, in particular, do not depend strongly on the renormalization technique employed, except a slightly difference in the neutron-proton interaction.
