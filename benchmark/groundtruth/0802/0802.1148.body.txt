Comments on "Charged particle dynamics in the field of slowly rotating compact star"

Slowly rotating neutron stars were first investigated in 1967 as a slow rotation approximation (0 <  a < 1,O(a2)) to the Kerr metric [\cite=hartle] and have astrophysical relevance as most of the observed pulsars are actually slowly rotating relative to the speed of light (one fifth for a millisecond pulsar) [\cite=rees]. Charged particle dynamics around such stars is investigated by constructing the corresponding Einstein-Maxwell equations assuming the slow rotation approximation [\cite=ress]. Later Mirza [\cite=mirza] solved the same model using an ansatz. The chosen ansatz was dimensionally inconsistent and yielded an unphysical answer for the fields which gives a divergent expression for the radiation emitted in the no rotation limit. We prove that his chosen ansatz, even after dimensional modification, gives a divergent result in the no rotation limit. We then suggest an ansatz that avoids divergences in any limit and is physically more meaningful.

The spacetime exterior to a slowly rotating neutron star is given by the slow rotation approximation to the Kerr metric:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

is the angular speed of a freely falling frame brought into rotation by frame dragging. Here and in what follows the Greek indices run as t,r,θ, and φ respectively and we use gravitational units in which G = 1 = c. The general relativistic form of the Maxwell equations is:

[formula]

[formula]

where g is the determinant of the metric tensor gαβ given by the Einstein equations and Jα is 4-vector current density. Here Fαβ is the generalized electromagnetic field tensor for an ideal fluid given by a unique tensorial expression:

[formula]

where ηαβγδ is the totally skew tensor, Eα and Bα are the electric and magnetic fields and uα is the unit velocity 4-vector [\cite=landau]. In general Jα is the sum of two terms corresponding to a convection and a conduction current:

[formula]

where ε is the proper charge density, σ is the conductivity of the fluid. For a zero angular momentum observer (ZAMO) ur and uθ vanish, and using uαuα =  - 1, the components of the 4-velocity vector are:

[formula]

The electromagnetic field outside the neutron star is now determined by eqs.(4) and (5). To solve this system of equations let us assume Mirza's ansatz modified to maintain dimensional consistency, for the electric field [formula]:

[formula]

where k1 and k2 are some dimensional constants. For the magnetic field [formula], the corresponding ansatz will be

[formula]

where k3 and k4 are some dimensional constants. Further, following Mirza, we take a constant angular speed of rotation, [formula].

Solving eqs.(4) and (5) using eqs.(9) and (10), we get

[formula]

[formula]

where A1 and A2 are arbitrary constants. It can easily be seen that in the no rotation limit i.e [formula], the electric and magnetic fields become infinite, which cannot be true, because it yields infinite energy radiated by a non-rotating neutron star. Further, the Poynting vector [formula]  gives the momentum flux and hence the energy radiated ε. It yields [formula]  where the proportionality factor depends upon k1...k4 and (r,θ). If it is non zero, the radiated energy diverges as [formula] which is impossible, and if ε = 0, the rotating star would not radiate and hence would not be a model for a pulsar. Infact, in general, for a rotating neutron star [formula] [\cite=rees]. Hence Mirza's ansatz does not work even after correcting for dimensions.

We present another ansatz that avoids the above mentioned impossibilities.

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] has r and θ dependence only. To solve eqs.(4) and (5) we shall use the following separation ansatz for electric and magnetic fields

[formula]

[formula]

Solving eqs.(4) and (5) using eqs.(13), (14) and (15) we get

[formula]

[formula]

where A3 and A4 are arbitrary constants. Hence, [formula] and [formula] remain finite in the no-rotation limit and the radiation vanishes for a non-rotating object, as required.

There will be several other ansatz that would yield solutions to the system of equations but care must be taken to avoid non-physical solutions such as Mirza obtained. As an extension to the problem, one can solve the above system using the source terms i.e. jα  ≠  0 and deduce some physically interesting realizable results.
