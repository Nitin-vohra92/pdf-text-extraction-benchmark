Introduction

Since their discovery [\citep=Giacconi71] [\citep=Tananbaum72], accreting X-ray pulsars have been major objects for both observational and theoretical study [\citep=WSH83] [\citep=Nagase89] [\citep=Bildsten97]. The majority of known X-ray pulsars are high-mass binary systems with supergiant or Be donors, clearly associated with younger stellar populations and regions of recent star formation [\citep=CC06].

Traditionally, the study of X-ray pulsars was limited to our Galaxy and neighboring Magellanic Clouds, because of the limited sensitivity and spatial resolution of previous X-ray missions. The advanced capabilities of a new generation of X-ray telescopes ( Chandra and XMM-Newton) have not only caused a rush of new X-ray pulsar discoveries in the Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds [\citep=Lutovinov05] [\citep=Chernyakova05] [\citep=Karasev08] [\citep=HP04] [\citep=Edge04] [\citep=McGowan07], but also opened the possibility to extend X-ray pulsar search to more distant galaxies both inside [\citep=O01] [\citep=T05] [\citep=TP08] and beyond the Local Group [\citep=TPC07]. The nearby galaxies with recent star formation are especially suitable candidates for such studies, since they provide the environment in which X-ray pulsars are expected to be plentiful.

The nearby SB(s)d spiral galaxy NGC 1313 at 4.1 Mpc [\citep=Mendez02], provides an excellent opportunity to study X-ray source populations in a normal galaxy. The overall properties of NGC 1313 are similar to that of irregular Magellanic-type galaxies, and late-type spirals with vigorous recent and ongoing star formation. NGC 1313 was a target of X-ray observations with the Einstein (Fabbiano & Trinchieri 1987), ROSAT (Colbert et al. 1995; Miller et al. 1998; Schlegel et al. 2000), ASCA (Petre et al. 1994), Chandra (Schlegel et al. 2004; Zampieri et al. 2004), XMM-Newton (Miller et al. 2003; Schlegel et al. 2004; Smith et al. 2007) and Suzaku (Mizuno et al. 2007) observatories. These observations uncovered a substantial X-ray source population with three ultraluminous X-ray sources (two accreting binaries and the Type IIn supernova SN 1978K) among them.

In this paper, we report on the discovery of the coherent 765.6 s pulsations in the flux of transient X-ray source XMMU J031747.5-663010 in NGC 1313, using archival data of XMM-Newton observations. We study X-ray spectral properties of the source, search for its optical/UV counterparts and discuss its nature.

Observations and data reduction

To study timing and spectral characteristics of XMMU J031747.5-663010, we used the data of 2004 November 23 XMM-Newton observation of NGC 1313 field with three European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) instruments (MOS1, MOS2 and pn) [\citep=Turner01] [\citep=Strueder01], and the Optical Monitor (OM) telescope (Mason et al. 2001)(Table [\ref=obslog]). We also used several 2000-2006 XMM-Newton [\citep=Smith07] and 2002-2003 Chandra observations of the same field to obtain upper limits on the source flux when the source was not detected.

We reduced XMM data using XMM-Newton Science Analysis System (SAS v 7.0.0). Before generating X-ray images, and source spectra and lightcurves, we performed standard screening of the original event files to exclude time intervals with high background levels, applying an upper count rate threshold of 20% above average background level. The standard SAS tool barycen was used to perform barycentric correction on the original EPIC event files used for timing analysis.

We generated EPIC-pn and MOS images of NGC 1313 field in the 0.3-7.0 keV energy band, and used the SAS standard maximum likelihood (ML) source detection script edetect_chain to detect and localize point sources. We used bright X-ray sources with known counterparts from USNO-B catalog [\citep=Monet03] and Chandra source lists to correct EPIC image astrometry. The astrometric correction was also applied to the OM images, using cross-correlation with USNO-B catalog. After correction, we estimate residual systematic error in the source positions to be of the order ~  1 arcsec  for both EPIC and OM.

To extract EPIC-pn source lightcurves and spectra during the 2004 November 23 XMM-Newton observation, we used the elliptical region with semi-axes of 22arcsec  and 18arcsec  and position angle of 40[formula]. Due to the source proximity to the edge of EPIC-MOS CCD, the source counts were extracted from the elliptical region with semi-axes of 20arcsec  and 16arcsec , including ~  70% of the source energy flux. The adjacent source-free regions were used to extract background spectra and lightcurves. The source and background spectra were then renormalized by ratio of the detector areas. For spectral analysis, we used data in the 0.3  -  7 keV energy band. In this analysis we use valid pn events with pattern 0-4 (single and double) and pattern 0-12 (single-quadruple) events for MOS cameras. To synchronize both source and background lightcurves from individual EPIC detectors, we used the identical time filtering criteria based on Mission Relative Time (MRT), following the procedure described in [\cite=Robin_timing]. The background lightcurves were not subtracted from the source lightcurves, but were used later to estimate the background contribution in the calculation of the source pulsed fractions.

The EPIC spectra were grouped to contain a minimum of 20 counts per spectral bin in order to allow χ2 statistics, and fit to analytic models using the XSPEC v.12 fitting package [\citep=arnaud96]. EPIC-pn, MOS1 and MOS2 spectra were fitted simultaneously, but with normalizations varying independently. For timing analysis we used standard XANADU/XRONOS v.5 tasks.

The data of Chandra observations was processed using the CIAO v3.4 threads. We performed standard screening of the Chandra data to exclude time intervals with high background levels. For each observation, we generated X-ray images in the 0.3-7 keV energy band, and used CIAO wavelet detection routine wavdetect to detect point sources.

To estimate upper limits on the quiescent source luminosities, the Chandra/ACIS and XMM/EPIC count rates were converted into energy fluxes in the 0.3-7 keV energy range using Web PIMMS, assuming an absorbed power law spectral shape with photon index Γ  =  1.5 and Galactic foreground absorbing column NH=[formula] cm- 2.

In the following analysis we assume a distance of 4.1 Mpc for NGC 1313 [\citep=Mendez02]. All parameter errors quoted are 68% (1σ) confidence limits.

Results

Source detection and optical counterparts

A new X-ray source XMMU J031747.5-663010 has been discovered in the data of the 2004 November 23 XMM-Newton observation of the NGC 1313 field (Table [\ref=obslog]). The estimated source luminosity was ~  1.6×  1039 ergs s- 1, assuming the distance of 4.1 Mpc. We measure the position of XMMU J031747.5-663010 to be [formula] (J2000 equinox) with an uncertainty of ~  1.0 arcsec  (Fig. [\ref=image_general]). The projected galactocentric distance of XMMU J031747.5-663010 is [formula] or ~  3.6 kpc at 4.1 Mpc. The analysis of other archival observations of the same field with XMM-Newton and Chandra did not yield source detection with an upper limit (2σ) ranging from ~  2  ×  1036 to ~  2  ×  1037 ergs s- 1 (or ~   80-800 times lower than outburst luminosity), depending on the duration of the observation and instrument used (Table [\ref=obslog]).

The search for the optical counterparts using the deep images of NGC 1313 from Las Campanas Observatory 2.5m du Pont telescope [\citep=Kuchinski00] did not yield stellar-like objects brighter than ~  21 mag in V and ~  20 mag in B band within the 3σ error circle of XMMU J031747.5-663010. We also used the data of the 2004 November 23 XMM-Newton/OM observation to search for optical/UV counterparts to the source during its X-ray outburst (Fig. [\ref=image_general]). We did not detect any stellar counterparts to XMMU J031747.5-663010 in the OM images down to the limit of ~  20 mag in the V and U bands.

X-ray pulsations

We performed timing analysis of XMMU J031747.5-663010 using the 2004 November 23 data from all three XMM-Newton/EPIC detectors in the 0.3-7 keV energy band. After a barycentric correction of the photon arrival times in the original event lists, we performed a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis using standard XRONOS task powspec, in order to search for coherent periodicities. For the analysis of XMM-Newton data, we used combined synchronized EPIC-pn and MOS lightcurves with 2.6 s time bins to improve sensitivity. We found strong peak in the Fourier spectrum at the frequency of ~  1.3[formula] Hz (Fig. [\ref=pds_efold], upper panel). The strength of the peak in the Fourier spectrum corresponds to the period detection confidence of [formula] [\citep=Vaughan94].

To estimate the pulsation period more precisely, we used an epoch folding technique, assuming no pulse period change during 2004 November 23 observation. The most likely value of the pulsation period, 765.6 s (Table [\ref=timing_spec_par]) was obtained fitting the peak in the χ2 versus trial period distribution with a Gaussian. The period errors in Table [\ref=timing_spec_par] were computed following the procedure described in Leahy (1987). The source lightcurves were folded using the periods determined from epoch folding analysis. The resulting folded lightcurve in the 0.3-7 keV energy band during 2004 November 23 XMM-Newton observation is shown in Fig. [\ref=pds_efold] ( lower panel). The source has quasi-sinusoidal pulse profile in the 0.3-7 keV energy band with a pulsed fraction of [formula]%. The pulsed fraction was defined as (I max-I min)/(I max+I min), where I max and I min represent source intensities at the maximum and minimum of the pulse profile, excluding background photons.

To investigate energy dependence of the source pulse profile, we extracted light curves in the soft (0.3-2 keV) and hard (2-7 keV) bands for 2004 Nov. 23 observation, and folded them at the corresponding best pulsation period (Fig. [\ref=mod_energy_depend]). Both bands show quasi-sinusoidal pulse profiles. Because of the relatively poor statistics, we could detect only marginal difference between source pulse profiles at low and high energies, which have background-corrected pulsed fractions of 34±  4% and 40±  4%.

X-ray spectra

The pulse phase averaged XMM-Newton/EPIC spectra of XMMU J031747.5-663010 can be adequately fit with the absorbed simple power law model with photon index, Γ  ~  1.5 and an equivalent hydrogen density N[formula] cm- 2. The corresponding absorbed luminosity of the source in the 0.3-7 keV band is [formula] ergs s- 1, assuming the distance of 4.1 Mpc. The best-fit spectral model parameters of the source are given in Table [\ref=timing_spec_par]. The measured absorbing column NH is ~  6 times higher than the Galactic hydrogen column in the direction of NGC 1313, 3.6[formula] cm- 2 [\citep=DL90], consistent with an additional intrinsic absorption within the system and inside the disk of NGC 1313.

Discussion

The absence of the bright optical counterpart to XMMU J031747.5-663010, its overall X-ray properties (spectrum, pulsations, transient behaviour), and positional coincidence with NGC 1313 disk, allow us to conclude that it should be located outside our Galaxy and probably belongs to NGC 1313. The X-ray pulsations and energy spectrum of XMMU J031747.5-663010 imply that it is almost certainly an accreting highly-magnetized neutron star in a high-mass binary system (White, Swank & Holt 1983; Nagase 1989). The association with NGC 1313 makes this source an extremely bright object with luminosity LX  ~  1.6  ×  1039 ergs s- 1, greatly exceeding the isotropic Eddington luminosity limit for a [formula] neutron star accreting hydrogen-rich material.

The relatively long pulse period of XMMU J031747.5-663010 (765.6 s) places it among the systems with a companion that is either a supergiant or a Be star on a Corbet diagram [\citep=Corbet86]. The transient behavior of the source lends support to the interpretation of this source as yet another Be binary, since the majority of Be systems display recurrent/transient outbursts. An extremely high luminosity of the source still falls into the luminosity range observed in the Be X-ray pulsars, with one system, A0538-66 known to reach similar luminosity during its giant (Type II) outburst [\citep=WC78] [\citep=Skinner82]. The high luminosity of XMMU J031747.5-663010 is also consistent with theoretical predictions for super-Eddington accretion onto highly magnetized ([formula] G) neutron star [\citep=BS76].

The high-mass nature of the system implies its relatively young age, consistent with its location within one of the spiral arms of NGC 1313 (Fig. [\ref=image_general]). Since the Be interpretation still remains preliminary, optical identification is essential to determine the nature of the system. For optical identification, deeper optical observations are needed. The follow-up monitoring observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton are needed to test if it shows recurrent outbursts. Future X-ray observations of XMMU J031747.5-663010, if it reappears, could improve source localization and study long-term evolution of its X-ray properties and X-ray pulsation.

XMMU J031747.5-663010 is the second X-ray pulsar detected outside the Local Group, after 18 s pulsating X-ray source CXOU J073709.1+653544 in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 2403 [\citep=TPC07]. Both sources are extremely bright transient systems with total luminosities [formula] ergs s- 1, and probably belong to a rare class of most luminous Be binary X-ray pulsars. Similar systems can be detected and studied effectively with a series of moderately deep (10-50 ks) monitoring XMM-Newton and Chandra observations up to the distances of several Mpc. Therefore, the detailed analysis of the existing archival and new observations of nearby spiral and irregular galaxies have a potential to significantly increase statistics of these systems and provide us with better understanding of their nature and connection to the underlying stellar population.
