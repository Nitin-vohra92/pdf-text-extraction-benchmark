Almost Periodic Szeg Cocycles with Uniformly Positive Lyapunov Exponents

Introduction

Suppose that (Ω,μ) is a probability measure space and T:Ω  →  Ω is ergodic with respect to μ. A measurable map [formula] gives rise to a so-called cocycle, which is a map from [formula] to itself given by (ω,v)  ↦  (Tω,A(ω)v). This map is usually denoted by the same symbol. When studying the iterates of the cocycle, the following matrices describe the dynamics of the second component:

[formula]

Assuming [formula] and

[formula]

then, by Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem, the following limit exists,

[formula]

and we have

[formula]

for μ-almost every ω∈Ω. The number γ is called the Lyapunov exponent of A.

We will be interested in the particular case of Szeg cocycles, which arise as follows. Denote the open unit disk in [formula] by [formula]. For a measurable function [formula] with

[formula]

and [formula], the cocycle [formula] is given by

[formula]

The Lyapunov exponent of Az will be denoted by γ(z). The complex numbers αn(ω)  =  f(Tnω), n  ≥  0, appearing in Az(Tnω) are called Verblunsky coefficients.

Szeg cocycles play a central role in the analysis of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle with ergodic Verblunsky coefficients; compare Simon's recent monograph [\cite=S] [\cite=S2] (see in particular [\cite=S2] for more information on Lyapunov exponents of Szeg cocycles). One of the major themes of [\cite=S] [\cite=S2] is to work out in detail the close analogy between the spectral analysis of Jacobi matrices, or more specifically discrete one-dimensional Schrödinger operators, and that of CMV matrices. Indeed, a large portion of the second part, [\cite=S2], is devoted to carrying over results and methods from the Schrödinger and Jacobi setting to the OPUC setting.

Sometimes the transition is straightforward and sometimes it is not. As discussed in the remarks and historical notes at the end of [\cite=S2], one of the results that Simon did not manage to carry over is Herman's result on uniformly positive Lyapunov exponents for a certain class of almost periodic Schrödinger cocycles [\cite=H] (see also [\cite=CFKS]), which is proved by a beautiful subharmonicity argument and which is at the heart of many of the recent, far more technical, advances in the area of Schrödinger operators with almost periodic potentials; see Bourgain's book [\cite=B] and references therein.

Our goal in this note is to present one-parameter families of almost periodic Szeg cocycles for which we prove uniformly positive Lyapunov exponents using Herman's argument for an explicit region of parameter values.

Examples with Uniformly Positive Lyapunov Exponents

Consider the 1-torus [formula] equipped with Lebesgue measure and [formula] equipped with the probability measure that assigns the weight [formula] to each of 0 and 1. Let [formula] be the product space and μ the product measure. Fix some irrational [formula]. The transformation T:Ω  →  Ω is given by T(θ,j)  =  (θ  +  α,j  +  1). It is readily verified that T is ergodic with respect to μ.

For ε∈(0,1) and [formula], we define [formula] by

[formula]

Clearly, f is measurable function from Ω to [formula] and satisfies log [(1   -   |f|2) -  1  /  2]∈L1(μ). Thus, the Lyapunov exponents γ(z), [formula] exist and we wish to bound them from below.

For (Ω,μ,T) as above and f given by [\eqref=fdef], we have the estimate

[formula]

In particular, if [formula], the Lyapunov exponent γ(  ·  ) is uniformly positive on [formula].

We consider the case k  >  0; the case k  <  0 is completely analogous. Fix any [formula]. By the definition [\eqref=sc] of Az and the definition [\eqref=fdef] of f, we have

[formula]

Let us conjugate these matrices as follows (cf. [\cite=GHMT]). Define

[formula]

For j  =  0, we have

[formula]

while for j  =  1, we have

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

We have [formula], which, by [\eqref=conj], is equal to

[formula]

Since Cz(θ,j) is always unitary and w  =  e2πiθ and z1 / 2 both have modulus one, we find that

[formula]

The w-dependence of the matrix in the last expression is analytic and hence the log  of its norm is subharmonic. Therefore,

[formula]

Since

[formula]

the result follows.

In Theorem [\ref=t.1] we considered functions given by simple exponentials. Since we obtained explicit terms which bound the Lyapunov exponents uniformly from below, it is possible to add small perturbations to the function and retain uniform positivity of the Lyapunov exponents. For example, given an integer k  ≥  1 and [formula], we set

[formula]

Since we need fλ to take values in [formula], we have to impose an upper bound on the admissible values of λ. Clearly, once ε∈(0,1), k  ≥  1 and the numbers [formula] are chosen, there is λ0  >  0 such that for λ with modulus bounded by λ0, the range of fλ is contained in [formula].

Let (Ω,μ,T) be as above. For every [formula], [formula], and [formula], there is λ1  >  0 such that for every λ with |λ|  <  λ1, there is γ-  >  0 for which the Lyapunov exponent γ(  ·  ) associated with fλ given by [\eqref=fdef] satisfies

[formula]

The smallness condition |λ|  <  λ1 needs to address two issues. First, the range of the function fλ must be contained in [formula], so we need λ1  ≤  λ0. Second, the explicit strictly positive uniform lower bound obtained in the proof of Theorem [\ref=t.1] for the case λ  =  0 changes continuously once the perturbation is turned on. Thus, it remains strictly positive for |λ| small enough. Notice that the degree requirements for the perturbation in [\eqref=fpertdef] are such that the subharmonicity argument from the proof of Theorem [\ref=t.1] goes through without any changes.

Discussion

In the previous section we proved a uniform lower bound for the Lyapunov exponents associated with strongly coupled almost periodic sequences of Verblunsky coefficients. A few remarks are in order.

The Verblunsky coefficients take values in the open unit disk and the unit circle has to be regarded as the analogue of infinity in the Schrödinger case. Thus, just as the coupling constant is sent to infinity in the application of Herman's argument in the Schrödinger case, the coupling constant is sent to one in our study. Notice that we need a rather uniform convergence to the unit circle, whereas one may have zeros in the Schrödinger case. In particular, while Herman's argument applies to all non-constant trigonometric polynomials in the Schrödinger case, we only treat small perturbations of simple exponentials.

Another limitation of our proof is that it requires the consideration of the product [formula]. It would be nicer to have genuine quasi-periodic examples, that is, generated by minimal translations on a finite-dimensional torus. Our attempts to produce such examples have run into trouble with analyticity issues. It would be of interest to produce quasi-periodic examples or to demonstrate why Herman's argument cannot work for any of them.

As explained by Simon in [\cite=S2], as soon as one knows that γ(z) is positive for (Lebesgue almost) every [formula], one can immediately deduce that for μ-almost all elements of Ω, Lebesgue almost all Aleksandrov measures associated with the sequence of Verblunsky coefficients in question are pure point. This is applicable to our examples for [formula] and |λ| small enough.
