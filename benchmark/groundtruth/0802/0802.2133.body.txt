Logarithmic vector fields along smooth divisors in projective spaces

Introduction

Let D be a smooth divisor in [formula] defined by a homogeneous polynomial f of degree k. We say that f is of Sebastiani-Thom type if f can be represented as the sum

[formula]

for a choice of a homogeneous coordinate (xi)ni = 0 of [formula] and some 0  ≤  l  ≤  n - 1.

We study the Torelli problem for logarithmic vector fields in the sense of Dolgachev and Kapranov [\cite=Dolgachev-Kapranov]. For a divisor D in the projective space [formula], the sheaf [formula] of logarithmic vector fields along D is defined as the subsheaf of the tangent sheaf [formula] whose section consists of vector fields tangent to D. It is the sheafification of

[formula]

where A is a homogeneous coordinate ring of [formula] and f∈A is the defining polynomial of D. A divisor D is said to be Torelli if the isomorphism class of [formula] as an [formula]-module determines D uniquely. The main theorem of Dolgachev and Kapranov [\cite=Dolgachev-Kapranov] is a condition for an arrangement of sufficiently many hyperplanes to be Torelli.

The main result in this paper is the following:

A smooth divisor in a projective space is Torelli if and only if its defining equation is not of Sebastiani-Thom type.

The strategy for the proof is the following:

The Jacobi ideal of a smooth divisor D of degree k is determined by the set of divisors E of degree k - 1 such that the dimension of [formula] jumps up.

A smooth divisor is determined by its Jacobi ideal if and only if it is not of Sebastiani-Thom type.

A divisor D is not Torelli if its defining equation is of Sebastiani-Thom type.

As a corollary of Theorem [\ref=th:main], we give another proof of the main theorem of [\cite=Ueda-Yoshinaga_SCC] that a smooth plane cubic curve is Torelli if and only if its j-invariant does not vanish.

Jacobi ideals from logarithmic vector fields

Let D be a smooth divisor of degree k in [formula] defined by a homogeneous polynomial f, and [formula] be the sheaf of logarithmic vector fields along D. We have an exact sequence

[formula]

where [formula] is the normal bundle of D in [formula], and an isomorphism

[formula]

of [formula]-modules. By the Euler sequence

[formula]

the space [formula] of global sections of [formula] is spanned by {∂  /  ∂xi}ni = 0. The image of the map

[formula]

induced by the composition

[formula]

is the restriction to D of the degree k - 1 part

[formula]

of the Jacobi ideal J(f) of f.

For a divisor E of [formula] of degree k - 1, the dimension of [formula] jumps up if and only if the defining equation of E is contained in the Jacobi ideal of D.

Since D is smooth,

[formula]

and we have an exact sequence

[formula]

from which follows the long exact sequence

[formula]

Note that the image of the map

[formula]

is the restriction to [formula] of the degree k - 1 part of the Jacobi ideal of D. Since the dimension of [formula] does not depend on E, the dimension of [formula] jumps up if and only if the defining equation of E is contained in the Jacobi ideal of D.

Divisors from their Jacobi ideals

We prove the following in this section:

If two smooth distinct divisors in [formula] have identical Jacobi ideals, their defining equations are of Sebastiani-Thom type.

We divide the proof into steps. Let f and g be homogeneous polynomials of degree k defining distinct smooth hypersurfaces such that their Jacobi ideals J(f) and J(g) are identical.

Indeed, any pencil of projective hypersurfaces contains a singular element F, and the assumption J(f)  =  J(g) implies that [formula] are linearly dependent. Let l be n minus the dimension of the linear span of {∂iF}ni = 0. Then we can choose a homogeneous coordinate so that ∂iF  =  0 for [formula] and {∂iF}ni = l + 1 is linearly independent. Note that one has l  <  n since the divisors defined by f and g are distinct.

The existence of the matrix (aij)ni,j = 0 follows from the inclusion J(F)  ⊂  J(f). We will show that if det (ai,j)ni,j = l + 1 vanishes, then the hypersurface defined by f is singular. Indeed, the vanishing of det (ai,j)ni,j = l + 1 and linear independence of {∂iF}ni = l + 1 and of {∂if}ni = 0 imply that some linear combination of {∂if}li = 0 is a linear combination of {∂iF}ni = l + 1. Then one can choose a homogeneous coordinate so that ∂0f is a linear combination of {∂jF}nj = l + 1. Assume that deg f  ≥  2, since any linear form is of Sebastiani-Thom type. Note that F does not depend on {xi}li = 0 since ∂iF  =  0 for [formula]. It follows that [formula] is a singular point of the hypersurface defined by f, since [formula] is the sum of x0 times some linear combination of {∂jF}nj = l + 1 and terms which are zero at [formula].

Since the (n - l)  ×  (n - l) matrix (aij)ni,j = l + 1 is invertible, one can find an (n - l)  ×  (n + 1) matrix (bij) such that

[formula]

for [formula]. Now make the projective coordinate transformation from (xi)ni = 0 to (Xi)ni = 0 defined by

[formula]

Then one has

[formula]

This implies

[formula]

for 0  ≤  i  ≤  l and

[formula]

for l + 1  ≤  i  ≤  n.

The fact

[formula]

and

[formula]

for l + 1  ≤  i  ≤  n shows

[formula]

for 0  ≤  i  ≤  l and l + 1  ≤  j  ≤  n. This implies that f is of Sebastiani-Thom type.

Since the isomorphism class of the sheaf of logarithmic vector fields along the divisor defined by [formula] does not depend on the choice of [formula], a divisor is not Torelli if its defining equation is of Sebastiani-Thom type.

Smooth plane cubic curves

Theorem [\ref=th:main] immediately yields the following:

A smooth plane cubic curve is Torelli if and only if its j-invariant does not vanish.

Since a smooth plane cubic curve has a vanishing j-invariant if and only if it is defined by the Fermat polynomial

[formula]

for a suitable choice of a homogeneous coordinate, it suffices to show that any cubic polynomial of the form

[formula]

can be brought to the Fermat polynomial by a projective linear coordinate change, which is obvious.
