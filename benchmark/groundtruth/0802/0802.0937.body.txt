Flavor Symmetries, Neutrino Masses and Neutrino Mixing

The central problem in flavor physics is a deeper understanding of the quark and lepton masses. Thus far we only understand the hadron masses, e. g. the mass of the nucleon. These masses are generated in QCD[\cite=Fritzsch] by the quark-gluon interaction. The confinement of the colored quarks and gluons leads to the appearance of a mass for the nucleons and the other hadrons. This mass is the confined field energy of the gluons and quarks inside the hadrons. The scale parameter Λc of QCD, measured to be about 220 MeV, determines the hadronic masses. But the masses of hadrons, especially the heavy ones like the J / ψ-meson, depend also on the quark masses, and they remain mysterious.

The Standard Model has 28 fundamental parameters, 22 of these parameters are directly related to the fermion masses: 6 quark masses, 3 charged lepton masses, 3 neutrino masses, 4 flavor mixing parameters for the quarks, and 6 for the leptons.

In the Standard Model the masses of the W / Z-bosons are due to the "Higgs"-mechanism, but we still do not know, whether the "Higgs"-model[\cite=Higgs] is true. Soon we shall find out, when the new LHC-accelerator at CERN starts producing experimental data.

It remains open, whether there exist relations between the fermion mass parameters. Many years ago I proposed such relations between the quark masses and the flavor mixing angles[\cite=Fri]. Using the parametrization, given in ref. (4), these relations are:

[formula]

The Cabibbo angle is approximately given by

[formula]

Taking into account the recent experimental data, these relations work very well. Similar relations might also exist for the leptons, as discussed below.

I shall concentrate on the neutrino mixing. About 10 aears ago Xing and I[\cite=Xifri] discussed the possibility that the mixing angles for the leptons are large, even maximal. The recent data support this hypothesis. But it is still unclear, what type of masses the neutrinos have. Are these masses like the masses of the charged leptons, i. e. Fermi-Dirac-masses? Or are they Majorana masses? In any case these masses are very small, probably less than 1 eV. In the Standard Model with Fermi-Dirac neutrino masses this is not understood. If the neutrino masses are Majorana masses, one can introduce these masses, using the see-saw mechanism[\cite=Min]. If the Standard Model is embedded in the Grand Unified Theory, based on SO(10)[\cite=Frimin], the small Majorana neutrino masses reflect the heavy masses of the righthanded neutral leptons, which are part of the 16-dimensional fermion representation of SO(10).

The relations (1) follow from an underlying texture zero mass matrix:

[formula]

We describe the neutrino mixing by the following flavor mixing matrix:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where sν stands for sin Θν, sl for sin Θl, s for sin Θ, etc. The angle Θν is the solar mixing angle [formula], the angle Θ the atmospheric angle [formula] and the angle Θl describes the mixing between the electron neutrino and the third mass eigenstate.

The experiments give:

[formula]

We assume that the lepton mass matrices are described, like the quarks, by a texture zero matrix (2). Thus we have:

[formula]

(m1,m2 are the masses of the first, second neutrino). Using the experimental value [formula], we find:

[formula]

Taking into account the observed (mass)2 differences Δm221  ≈  8  ·  10- 5eV2 and Δm232  ≈  2.3  ·  10- 3eV2, we obtain the following neutrino masses:

[formula]

Note that the mass ratio m2  /  m3 is:

[formula]

In order to calculate the atmospheric angle Θ, we take φ  =  π in eq. (2) and find:

[formula]

The angle Θ is about 38[formula]. In eq. (12) there is a phase parameter eiφ multiplying the second term. In order to obtain 38[formula], we have to assume that φ is close to zero, i. e. in the leptonic sector the CP violation should be very xmall, at least one order of magnitude smaller than for the quarks.

Our expected value [formula] is on the low side of the experimental data, which give [formula]. We have sin 2Θ  ≈  0.94.

The matrix element V3e of the mixing matrix is sin Θl  ·   sin Θ, and we find: V3e  ≈  0.043. New experiments with reactor neutrinos might detect this matrix element.

We summarize: We assume that the lepton mass matrices have the texture zero form (3) with D  =  0. The three mixing angles can be calculated as functions of the lepton masses.

The three neutrino masses are

[formula]

There is a normal mass hierarchy: m1  <  m2  <  m3, but the mass ratios 0.5 and 0.7 are much smaller than the mass ratios for the quarks (u-quark: 0.005, 0.006; d-quarks: 0.05, 0.04).

We obtain:

[formula]

We do expect that the CP violation in the lepton sector is much smaller than the CP-violation in the quark sector. Thus in the coming experiments it will not be possible to observe a CP-violation.
