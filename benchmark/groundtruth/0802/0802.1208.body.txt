Seesaw Extended MSSM and Anomaly Mediation without Tachyonic Sleptons

Introduction

One of the leading candidates for TeV scale physics is the supersymmetric extension of the [\cite=Martin:1997ns] since it resolves an outstanding conceptual issue: the gauge hierarchy problem (or why [formula] is stable under radiative corrections). It also leads to gauge coupling unification as well as a candidate for dark matter of the universe if two additional assumptions are made: a grand desert until M  ~  1016 GeV for gauge unification, and exact R-parity for dark matter. In addition it has the potential to explain the origin of spontaneous breaking of electroweak symmetry. Of course, has to be a broken symmetry to conform with observations because no superpartner particles have been observed yet. Understanding the nature and origin of this breaking is a major challenge which has commanded a great deal of attention. An attractive and elegant mechanism is to use the superconformal anomaly[\cite=Randall:1998uk] [\cite=Giudice:1998xp] to break supersymmetry in the manner that has been dubbed . provides an ultra-violet insensitive way to determine the soft breaking parameters[\cite=Dine:2007me] [\cite=Boyda:2001nh] as they depend only on the TeV scale gauge Yukawa couplings of the low energy theory. Consequently, it considerably reduces the number of arbitrary parameters of the breaking sector. It also provides a heavy gravitino which has a number of cosmological advantages.

A major problem of is that when implemented in the , it leads to negative slepton mass-squares--an unacceptable scenario since it leads to the breakdown of electric charge (sometimes called the tachyonic slepton problem). Another stumbling block to realistic model building is : the explicit μ term in the gives a Bμ that is too large, while extensions like the fail to generate a μ term that is large enough. A number of attempts have been made to extend the in order to cure these problems[\cite=Chacko:1999am] [\cite=Gherghetta:1999sw] [\cite=Katz:1999uw] [\cite=Pomarol:1999ie] [\cite=Arkani-Hamed:2000xj] [\cite=Allanach:2000gu] [\cite=Jack:2000cd] [\cite=Carena:2000ad] [\cite=Ibe:2004tg] [\cite=Okada:2002mv], usually with a focus on the tachyonic slepton problem.

Since in models the breaking profile is crucially dependent on the low energy theory, an interesting question arises as to whether still has the same problems when the extended to accomodate neutrino masses. In a recent paper[\cite=Mohapatra:2007xq], we pointed out that when the is minimally extended to the model with B  -  L  =  2 triplets to implement the seesaw mechanism, the low energy particle content and interaction profile changes just enough to cure the negative slepton mass square problem. A key feature responsible for this cure is the appearance of a naturally light SU(2)L triplet and a doubly-charged singlet which have leptonic Yukawa interactions. In Ref.[\cite=Mohapatra:2007xq], we explained how fixes the tachyonic slepton problem of and also noted some of the gross distinguishing features of the model--such as the appearance of B  -  L  =  2 triplets, doubly-charged Higgs bosons, and a pair of additional heavy Higgs doublets all with masses around the mass scale of conformal breaking, Fφ--typically in the tens of TeVs. Since then another paper has explored the relationship of neutrinos and in the context of defltected [\cite=Mohapatra:2007js].

In this paper, which should be viewed as a sequel to ref.[\cite=Mohapatra:2007xq], we attempt to present a complete phenomenologically acceptable model addressing questions such as , and dark matter. A summary of our results is as follows:

We show that the model below the Fφ scale is the with a singlet superpotential mass term, μN. This term is necessary for and can arise from the framework necessary for the solution to the tachyonic slepton problem.

One implication of the similarity to the below the TeV scale is that the magnitude of the Bμ-term is of the desired magnitude.

We present the sparticle spectrum of the model for a generic choice of the parameters and in particular we display the lightest superparticle which can be the dark matter of the universe. We find that same generation sleptons are degenerate and that a possibility exists for degenerate sleptons and squarks.

We find that the mass difference between the chargino and the lightest neutralino in our model is much larger than the models where a universal scalar mass corrects the tachyonic slepton mass problem.

The paper is organized as follows: in Section [\ref=Sec:SUSYLR+AMSB.Review], we review the basic ingredients of the model that is the framework of our discussion; in Section [\ref=Sec:TeV.Model.Spectrum], we show the multi-TeV scale spectrum of the model and discuss how it solves the negative slepton mass square problem of the model; in Section [\ref=Sec:Low.Scale.Theory], we discuss the effective theory below the Fφ TeV scale and show how electroweak symmetry breaking arises. In Section [\ref=Sec:Sparticle.Masses], we display the sparticle spectrum and compare it with that in some other benchmark models with different breaking mechanisms. For the allowed parameter space of our model, we find a Higgsino-wino mixture to be the and mention its prospects as the dark matter of the universe. We finish with a brief discussion of the ultraviolet consequences of this model in Section [\ref=Sec:Miscelleneous] and a conclusion.

Minimal Model Cures the problems of : a brief review

In generic models the soft breaking parameters associated with the superfield combination ΦiΦj * are determined by the anomalous dimensions [formula] and the scaling functions [formula], [formula] of the low energy theory:

[formula]

Here Fφ is the breaking scale in the gauge where the conformal compensator φ has the form

[formula]

with Fφ as an input parameter having a value in the 10s of TeV range. The remainder of our notational conventions can be found in Appendix [\ref=App:Notation.Conventions].

It is clear from Eq. [\eqref=Eq:AMSB.scalar.mass] that when this formula is applied to the , the slepton mass-squares are negative due to the positive (asymptotically non-free) SU(2)  ×  U(1)Y gauge couplings' β functions and the nearly zero lepton Yukawa couplings. As pointed out in Ref. [\cite=Mohapatra:2007xq], this problem is cured by extending the to due to the following property: the effective theory below the seesaw scale vR contains a set of SU(2)L triplets and doubly-charged fields, both having Yukawa couplings to the left- and right-handed leptons respectively. Their masses are naturally in the multi-TeV range despite the high seesaw scale due to an accidental global symmetry of the theory[\cite=Aulakh:1998nn] [\cite=Chacko:1997cm]. Furthermore, provided these new couplings are of order 1, the slepton masses squares can be made positive. Thus, not only explains the small neutrino masses by means of the seesaw mechanism, but its marriage with cures the negative slepton mass-square problem. The resulting theory combines the predictive power of , explains neutrino masses, and retains a natural dark matter candidate due to the theory's automatic conservation of R-Parity below the right-handed scale. It also contains a mechanism for generating an appropriate singlet in the effective low energy -like superpotential. In the following subsections, we fill in the details.

The Left-Right Model

The particle content of a model is shown in Table [\ref=Table:QM_Numbers]. As the model is left-right symmetric, it contains both left- and right-handed higgs bosons--in this case B  -  L  =    ±  2 triplets so that R-parity may be preserved (a task for which B  -  L  =  1 doublets are not suitable). The presence of both SU(2)L and SU(2)R triplets means that parity is a good symmetry until SU(2)R breaks. While the seesaw mechanism may be achieved with only SU(2)R higgs fields, demanding parity forces the presence of left-handed triplets. The inclusion of both these fields then leads to positive left- and right-handed slepton masses.

To be explicit, the fields of Table [\ref=Table:QM_Numbers] transform under parity as

[formula]

so that the fully parity symmetric superpotential is

[formula]

with

[formula]

[formula]

Furthermore, parity demands that the couplings be related as

[formula]

We have also imposed a discrete [formula] symmetry on Eq. [\eqref=Eq:SuperW.SUSYLR] with

[formula]

and S invariant. This symmetry is necessary to keep one singlet light below the right-handed scale since it forbids terms such as

[formula]

which would generate a large, O(vR), mass for N. Yet because it is a global symmetry, it will be violated by gravitational effects leading to Eq. [\eqref=Eq:SuperW.SUSYLR] containing the non-renormalizable terms of Eq. [\eqref=Eq:SuperW.SUSYLR.nr.gsv] (which are accordingly suppressed by the planck scale [formula]).

The superpotential Eq. [\eqref=Eq:SuperW.SUSYLR] must also contain the additional non-renormalizable terms given by Eq. [\eqref=Eq:SuperW.SUSYLR.nr.gsp] if the theory is to preserve R-parity and be phenomenologically viable[\cite=Aulakh:1998nn] [\cite=Chacko:1997cm]. These terms preserve the [formula] symmetry and are therefore suppressed by the next new scale of physics, which we have chosen to call MX. We will show that it is possible to fix MX in Section [\ref=Sec:TeV.Model.Spectrum], where we consider the Fφ scale theory.

Meanwhile, the Higgs potential given by Eq. [\eqref=Eq:SuperW.SUSYLR.Higgs] dictates that the for the right-handed superfields are

[formula]

With [formula] GeV, where vR is the right-handed breaking scale. Eq. [\eqref=Eq:vev.S.heavy] should be evident from the form of the superpotential; Eq. [\eqref=Eq:vev.Dc.Dbarc] requires Eq. [\eqref=Eq:SuperW.SUSYLR.Higgs] to be recast as

[formula]

The non-renormalizable terms will shift the right-handed scale s by at most ~  M2Δ  /  MX  ≪  MΔ so they may be safely be ignored. The theory then remains insensitive below vR[\cite=Pomarol:1999ie] and hence respects the trajectory below this scale. Yet even though the particles remain on their trajectory, the negative slepton mass-squares problem is still solved due to the additional low-scale yukawa couplings f and fc.

To see why these yukawas survive, consider the Higgs sector of Eq. [\eqref=Eq:SuperW.SUSYLR] before SU(2)R breaks and setting the non-renormalizable terms to zero--essentially leaving just the terms in Eq. [\eqref=Eq:SuperW.SUSYLR.Higgs]. This superpotential has a complexified U(6) symmetry involving the Δ's and the Δc's (similar symmetry arguments are discussed in [\cite=Dutta:1998bn], but because the authors used a parity odd singlet, there was only a complexified U(3) symmetry). When SU(2)R breaks, the U(6) is reduced to a U(5) yielding 22 real degrees of freedom that are massless. The D-terms and the gauge fields consume 6 of these, leaving a total of 16 massless modes. The surviving 16 massless real degrees of freedom are the two doubly-charged SU(2)L singlets and the two left-handed triplets.

Only the non-renormalizable terms of Eqs. [\eqref=Eq:SuperW.SUSYLR.nr.gsp] and [\eqref=Eq:SuperW.SUSYLR.nr.gsv] break the U(6) symmetry, and therefore the mass of the Higgsino must be

[formula]

The breaking bilinear terms generated by will force these masses to be at least Fφ giving

[formula]

Thus, the scale of new physics is determined by the right-handed scale and the breaking scale.

The mass matrix for the left-handed triplets and doubly-charged Higgses have a similar form, here we state the doubly-charged matrix:

[formula]

where μDC≃Fφ and [formula]. The eigenvalues of this mass matrix are m2DC  =  εΔμ2DC and M2DC  =  2μ2DC. Since εΔ depends on μDC, and μDC can be adjusted through the coupling it contains, one doubly-charged Higgs can be made light. On the whole, we expect the two doubly charged scalar masses to be above 1 TeV (for the lighter one) and Fφ (for the heavier one). Note that there is no such splitting between the fermionic partners, which remain heavy with a mass of about μDC. A similar argument applies to the left-handed triplets.

Finally, because the masses of the SU(2)L triplets and the doubly-charged particles will be around Fφ, they are of the correct size to influence the low-scale theory: if the masses had been large, Fφ  ≪  μDC  ≪  vR, then they would have merely introduced another trajectory preserving threshold that decoupled from the low scale theory. However, because these particles remain in the low-scale theory, the effect of their couplings is important. For the sleptons the relevant terms are

[formula]

with the surviving yukawa couplings fc and f providing positive mass-squares to the scalar leptons

To make this explicit we write down the slepton masses with the contributions of these additional interactions (taking the SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y gauge couplings to be g2 and g1 respectively):

[formula]

[formula]

Taking

[formula]

assuming that f, fc are diagonal in flavor space (an assumption required to satisfy constraints from lepton flavor violating experiments[\cite=Bellgardt:1987du]), and neglecting the first and second generation yukawa couplings simplifies Eqs. [\eqref=Eq:Right.Selectron.Mass] and [\eqref=Eq:Selectron.Mass] to

[formula]

for the first generation. We then only need

[formula]

to make the sleptons positive (from the detailed analysis of Section [\ref=Sec:Sleptons]).

These couplings and the masses of the doubly-charged field and the left-handed triplets are experimentally constrained from muonium-antimuonium oscillations[\cite=Willmann:1998gd] which demands that

[formula]

The minimum f values that satisfies Eq. [\eqref=Eq:f.Limits] implies a lower bound on the masses of the doubly-charged and left-handed triplet Higgs field to be about mDC,mΔ  ≥  2 TeV. The lighter end of this range is clearly accessible at the .

It is worth noting that even though the f,fc are diagonal, one may obtain large neutrino mixing. As already noted, the neutrino masses arise from the type I seesaw[\cite=Minkowski:1977sc] [\cite=Gell-Mann:1980vs] [\cite=Yanagida:1979as] [\cite=Glashow:1979nm] [\cite=Mohapatra:1979ia] formula given by:

[formula]

Note that the Yukawa coupling matrix yν is arbitrary and can be easily arrange to give large mixings even though f is diagonal and we can fit the neutrino data by appropriate choice of parameters.

Between Scales: vR to Fφ

Once SU(2)R breaks around the seesaw scale of 1011 GeV, the effective theory contains the , an extra set of higgs doublets, a pair of left-handed triplets, and the doubly-charged fields. The non-renormalizable terms of Eq. [\eqref=Eq:SuperW.SUSYLR] also influence the form of the lower scale theory and produce some important effects that aid in construction of a realistic low-energy theory. One significant contribution comes from the higher dimensional operators: the generation of a mass term for N. Specifically the terms

[formula]

generate a superpotential term of μNφN2 when Δc, c, and S get a . The mass μN is given by

[formula]

Because the vR threshold preserves the trajectory, this explicit mass term produces a breaking bilinear term proportional to Fφ

[formula]

with bN given as

[formula]

In Section [\ref=Sec:Low.Scale.Theory] this term will be shown to play an important role in ; for now it suffices to note that if bN is to be of the expected order of [formula], then the right-handed scale must be around vR≃1011 GeV. Constraining vR automatically determines the scale of new physics MX from Eq. [\eqref=Eq:new.physics.expression]: [formula]-1018 GeV. The end result is that the order of magnitude of all the scales of the theory are fixed.

Furthermore, the non-renormalizable terms can also be used to simplify the low-energy theory, though this is not necessary. Consider the terms

[formula]

which yield a low energy mass matrix for the Φ's that is not symmetric between Φ1 and Φ2 (due to the second term). The asymmetry generates an operator of the form:

[formula]

without the corresponding Hu1Hd2 term. This allows a large mass, say of order Fφ, for Hu2 and Hd1 while leaving Hu1 and Hd2 light. The resulting s for [formula] and [formula] will then be suppressed by M and will not play a role in the theory below Fφ.

Finally, as discussed in Section [\ref=Sec:SUSYLR+AMSB.Review], the non-renormalizable terms yield masses around Fφ for the left-handed triplets as well as the doubly-charged fields. These fields therefore decouple from the electroweak scale theory along with the extra bi-doublet due to the doublet-doublet splitting mechanism discussed above. This leaves the low energy theory as the and we use this to explore electroweak symmetry breaking as well as the remaining consequences of the low-energy theory.

EWSB

Naively it would be expected that the resulting low-energy theory is merely the (since the remaining particle content is precisely that theory), but if this were the case, the model would not be able to achieve a realistic mass spectrum--the singlet N would get a very small , and the Higgsino would be lighter than allowed by experiment[\cite=Kitano:2004zd]. The origin of this problem is best illustrated with a toy model:

Toy Exposition

Consider a superpotential given by

[formula]

where N is a singlet field with no gauge symmetries. The resulting scalar potential, including breaking, is

[formula]

Assuming the parameters κ, aκ, and [formula] are real, the minimization condition for Eq. [\eqref=Eq:AMSB.NMSSM.Toy] is

[formula]

and the solution is given as

[formula]

The soft couplings aκ and mN are determined by via Eqs. [\eqref=Eq:AMSB.scalar.mass] and [\eqref=Eq:AMSB.trilinear.A]:

[formula]

Substituting these into Eq. [\eqref=Eq:AMSB.NMSSM.Toy.S.light.vev] yields

[formula]

and the large negative under the radical demonstrates the inability to achieve a real, non-zero in this model.

The source of the problem can be identified by examining the potential of N. To expose the difficulty, it is helpful to define

[formula]

and re-write Eq. [\eqref=Eq:AMSB.NMSSM.Toy] as

[formula]

where the expressions of Eq. [\eqref=Eq:AMSB.NMSSM.Toy.Terms] have been substituted. For the potential to have a non-trivial minimum, it is necessary that the cubic term dominate for some value of x (since this term is the only one that provides a negative contribution to the potential); however, for large κ, the x2 term will always be larger than the cubic term. Meanwhile, for small κ the quartic term will dominate the expression. Therefore, if there is any chance for the x3 term to create a minimum other than zero, it must be that κ≃1. This leaves the potential as

[formula]

where it now becomes clear that neither large x, x  ~  1, nor small x will have the cubic term dominate the expression--leaving the only minimum as the trivial one. Thus, the heart of the problem is that predicts the cubic term's coefficient such that it will always be weaker than either the quartic or quadratic regardless of the parameter regime.

The same problem carries over to the full , as pointed out in [\cite=Kitano:2004zd]. In this model, the additional coupling of N to Hu and Hd does not alter the relative strengths of N's quartic, cubic, or quadratic terms, but it does add a linear term to the potential, aλvuvdN. The induced linear term shifts the trivial minimum away from zero, but keeps it small. The minimization condition for N can then be approximated as

[formula]

with [formula] being essentially the predicted soft breaking mass for N. The maximum value occurs when sin 2β  =  1 so we have that

[formula]

The small [formula] then results in a chargino mass which falls below the LEP II bound of about 94 GeV.

Given this limitation of the , it is desirable to explore methods that either alter the relative strengths of the terms or yield a large tadpole term for N. The former may be done by adding vector-like matter (as in [\cite=Chacko:1999am]), while the latter was explored in [\cite=Kitano:2004zd] by introducing a linear term for N. We propose here a different solution that alters the relative strengths and is already present in the model.

Low Energy Theory

The superpotential of Eq. [\eqref=Eq:SuperW.SUSYLR] contains in its non-renormalizable terms the key to solving the small [formula] problem: as discussed in Section [\ref=Sec:TeV.Model.Spectrum], the terms of Eq. [\eqref=Eq:SuperW.SUSYLR.nr.gsv] generate a mass term for N given by Eq. [\eqref=Eq:mu.S.Light]. This mass term then yields a breaking bilinear term given by Eq. [\eqref=Eq:bilinearB.S.light]. The size of bN is quite conveniently around the breaking scale and also provides a means of turning the net mass-square of N negative. To establish this property we now turn to the effective [formula]-scale theory.

The effective superpotential responsible for (valid for [formula]) is

[formula]

and the breaking potential is

[formula]

The resulting Higgs sector potential is

[formula]

with VF and VD the typical contribution:

[formula]

The potential of Eq. [\eqref=Eq:MSUSY.Higgs.Potential] can be made to spontaneously break electroweak symmetry giving

[formula]

and we take the usual definitions: vu  =  v sin β and vd  =  v cos β. The minimization conditions are

[formula]

The tilded variables are introduced to display the deviations from the usual due to the presence of the term μN in Eq. [\eqref=Eq:MSUSY.Super.Potential]. These constructs are defined as

[formula]

Of particular interest is Eq. [\eqref=Eq:MSUSY.mSqr.S.light.eff], which may be recast using Eq. [\eqref=Eq:bilinearB.S.light] of Section [\ref=Sec:TeV.Model.Spectrum]:

[formula]

The second line follows from the fact that [formula] and therefore the μ2N term is negligible compared to the the other terms. The last line uses the expression for the scalar mass-squared, assuming it is dominated by the λ contribution. As can be seen, due to the λ4 suppression, it is relatively easy to adjust μN to the appropriate value to make 2N negative and therefore induce a singlet of the correct size. Given that [formula] (from constraints of perturbativity to the right-handed scale) and that [formula], it is only necessary for [formula] GeV to achieve chargino masses above the LEP II bound. Figure [\ref=Fig:S.Light.Values] shows that such values are easily attainable in this situation. In the figure, constant n contours are plotted in the μN-κ(vR) plane treating the s of the Higgs doublets as constant background values with tan β  =  3.25, Fφ  =  33 TeV, and λ(vR)  =  0.5. The ample parameter space therefore demonstrates that this inherent property of our model easily provides a means to resolve the conflict between and the .

The resulting mass spectrum for this ÑMSSM is quite similar to the (see [\cite=Ellis:1988er])--particularly for the scalar and charged Higgses whose mass matrices are given by

[formula]

and

[formula]

defining [formula].

On the other hand, the pseudoscalar mass matrix gets a contribution from the [formula] term which is rather large and typically guarantees that the heavier pseudoscalar is mostly singlet. Its mass matrix is given by:

[formula]

The neutralino and chargino mass matrices remain similar to the , and in the bases [formula], [formula] they are:

[formula]

[formula]

respectively.

A Brief Summary of Scales

With achieved and the mass spectrum given, we now have a complete picture of the physics starting at the high scale vR and coming down to the electroweak scale. The theory starts as a parity-conserving model with generating the breaking, breaks down to the +  +  (but without introducing new breaking effects), and finally ends up at [formula] as the ÑMSSM (as elucidated in Figure [\ref=Fig:SUSYLR+AMSB.schematic]). We may now turn our attention to the rich phenomenological consequences of this theory.

Phenomenology

The following numerical values are based on our parameter running scheme. We run the gauge coupling values from the electroweak scale to the right-handed scale, vR  =  2  ×  1011 taking the Fφ threshold into account by decoupling the triplets and doubly charged fields. Yukawa couplings are then inputs at the right-handed scale: the third generation values for the couplings (yQ,yL) and all three generations of the seesaw couplings (f,fc). These are evolved down to the scale [\cite=Setzer:2005hg] [\cite=Martin:1993zk]. Because of parity f  =  fc at the right-handed scale and all of the off diagonal terms are taken to be negligible due to lepton flavor violating constraints. We also assume that the first and second generation seesaw couplings are equal (f2  =  f1) for simplicity. Soft terms follow their trajectory, given by Eqs. [\eqref=Eq:AMSB.scalar.mass], [\eqref=Eq:AMSB.trilinear.A] and [\eqref=Eq:AMSB.gaugino.mass] down to the Fφ scale, below which the soft terms are evolved to the scale using the usual s of the [\cite=King:1995vk]. Note that due to the mass splitting between the Higgsinos and Higgses of both the doubly charged and left-handed triplets descriped in Section [\ref=Sec:Left-Right], there will be some corrections to the s. These corrections will depend on the mass splitting and will be fairly small.

Numerical results will be compared to popular breaking models: , and --an in which the slepton mass problem is fixed by adding a universal mass, m0 to all sfermion soft masses [\cite=Giudice:1998xp]. Note that slepton phenomenological comparisons to also apply to [\cite=Allanach:2000gu] since the additional R-parity violating lepton sector Yukawa coupling is analogues to adding a universal slepton mass.

The Spectrum

Before engaging in the full details of the various sectors of the model, it is helpful to take a step back and look at the overall spectrum. Figure [\ref=Fig:particle.spectrum.fermions] examines the bosinos and Figure [\ref=Fig:particle.spectrum.bosons] the sfermions in this model and compares their masses to similar points in parameter space for , and calculated from isajet [\cite=Paige:2003mg] (matching between the different points were done based on the gluino mass). The columns of the bosino chart, Figure [\ref=Fig:particle.spectrum.fermions], from left to right are gluino, neutralino and chargino. The columns of the sfermion chart, Figure [\ref=Fig:particle.spectrum.bosons] from left to right are: left-handed first generation, right-handed first generation, lightest mass third generation (and third generation neutrinos), heaviest third generation and gluinos--for comparison with the bosino chart. The Higgses and the mostly singlino neutralino have not been included to keep from clottering the plots, although their masses are reported in Table [\ref=Table:Spectrum].

The most striking general feature of these figures is the degeneracy of the spectrum between colored and electroweak particles in LR-AMSB. While this is very dependent on the seesaw couplings (Table [\ref=Table:Spectrum] shows slepton masses that are lighter than the squarks due to smaller values of the seesaw couplings), it is a possibility that is difficult to achieve in other models. Table [\ref=Table:Spectrum] also shows the Higgs masses. Here H3 and A2 are the mostly singlet scalar and pseudoscalar. Due to the large size of the singlet , these fields decouple from the spectrum as does the mostly singlino 05. The neutral scalar Higgs masses stated include the full radiative corrections due to top and stop loops [\cite=Ellwanger:1993hn]. These corrections need [formula] GeV which implies [formula] TeV to allow the Higgs to be above the LEP II bound. In the following subsections, we will continue to explore this spectrum, focusing on the sleptons, squarks and finally the neutralinos and charginos.

Sleptons

We start this discussion by analyzing the seeseaw yukawa couplings f and fc. In all the work that follows, we take their maximum value at vR to be [formula] based on perturbativity arguments. Of immediate note is the fixed point-like behavior of these couplings. This can be seen in Figure [\ref=Fig:f.FIXED.POINT], which plots fc1 verses the log of the energy scale for initial values of (a) f3(vR)  =  0 and (b) f3(vR)  =  3.5; the curves, in ascending order, correspond to f1(vR)  =  0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2.25, 3.5. Increasing the initial value of f3 decreases the value of f1 at the TeV scale as can be seen by comparing Figure [\ref=Fig:f.FIXED.POINT.f3.Zero] and Figure [\ref=Fig:f.FIXED.POINT.f3.3.5].

Similar plots can be drawn for the other couplings: f1,fc3 and fc1, but their qualitative behavior follows those in Figure [\ref=Fig:f.FIXED.POINT]. Table [\ref=Table:Fixed.Point.Values] illustrates the quantitative differences in the values of the fixed points. For initial values of f1 and f3 greater than 1.5, these values are correct up to 2%. The higher values for the right-handed sector (fc) are due to the slower running caused by the broken SU(2)R symmetry.

This fixed point like behavior translates into an upper bound for the slepton masses. This can be seen in Figure [\ref=Fig:SLEPTON.MASS.VERSES.f], which displays the dependence of the selectron masses on the initial value of the seesaw coupling. For this plot f1(vR)  =  f3(vR) has been assumed for simplicity. For f  ≥  0.5 the yukawa coupling contribution is comparable in size to the gauge coupling contribution in the mass expression, e.g. Eq. [\eqref=Eq:Right.Selectron.Mass]. The mass' quartic dependence on the seesaw couplings is reflected in its steep rise near 0.5 and its rapid surpassing of the LEP II bound. At a value of f  ~  1 this steep ascent slows down indicating the onset of the fixed point behavior, beyond which the low energy observable f(Fφ) values are approximately 0.6.

The masses of the other sleptons follow the behavior of Figure [\ref=Fig:SLEPTON.MASS.VERSES.f], a general feature of which is the mild degeneracy between the left and right -handed slepton masses. This seems a bit contrary to Eqs. [\eqref=Eq:AMSB.Mass.Selectron.Right] and [\eqref=Eq:AMSB.Mass.Selectron.Left], which show that the factor for f41 term for the left-handed sleptons is twice as large as that of the right-handed sleptons. However, this term is capped by the fixed-point of f1 and the negative SU(2)L contribution happens to be a little less than half of this value (an accidental cancelation) yielding the degeneracy.

This is an interesting situation phenomologically since it numerically falls in between / and . In , left-handed slepton masses get larger positive contributions from M2 as they run from the ultraviolet. In boundary conditions dictate that the left-handed to right-handed mass ratio is about 2:1. Meanwhile, in , both sectors get the same contribution from m0, the universal masses needed to make the sleptons non-tachyonic, which drops out in the mass splitting at tree level. Furthermore, there are accidental cancellations in the anomaly induced splittings related to the gauge contributions and in the D-term contributions [\cite=Gherghetta:1999sw] [\cite=Feng:1999hg]. The upshot of this is that the mass splitting is usually dominated by loop-level effects and is quite small [\cite=Gherghetta:1999sw].

As a concrete example for , including the first loop leading log, the difference between the masses squared with tan β  =  3.25 and Fφ  =  33 TeV is given by Δe  =  m2ẽL  -  m2ẽR  ~  751 [formula] [\cite=Gherghetta:1999sw] [\cite=Feng:1999hg]. The corresponding percent difference, defined as [formula], is then highly dependent on the masses of the selectrons. For selectron massses above the mass of the given in Figure [\ref=Fig:SLEPTON.MASS.VERSES.f], ~  450 GeV, the percent difference is less than 1%. However, in LR-AMSB, the percent difference can rise as high as 5% as demonstrated in Figure [\ref=Fig:PERCENT.DIFFERENCE.CONTOURS], which gives contours for constant mass percent differences. Resolution of slepton masses from end-point lepton distribtution of the selectron decays at lepton collider is roughly 2% [\cite=Danielson:1996tf] making the measurement of such mass differences feasible. Therefore, measurements of mild mass differences of about 3  -  5% will signle this model out from the large mass differences of and while potentially discriminating it from the small mass differences of (although this will highly dependent on the values of the seesaw couplings).

Constant mass contours for the right-handed selectron are plotted in Figure [\ref=Fig:SLEPTON.MASS.CONTOUR] in the f3(vR)-f1(vR) plane. This plot allows a study of how the masses change with respect to both seesaw couplings. The horizontal and vertical grayed-out contours are ruled out due to LEP II bounds on the lightest stau and selectron masses of 81.9 GeV and 94 GeV respectively. Mass contours increase from left to right and correspond to mẽ  =  200, 300, 417 (the mass of the lightest neutralino, indicated with a dashed contour) 500, 550, 600, 610, 615, 620, 625, 630 GeV. The horizontal dashed curve represents a constant m1 contour at the mass of the lightest neutralino. Since the selectron is a first generation slepton its mass is mainly governed by f1, Eq. [\eqref=Eq:Selectron.Mass], explaining the small dependence on f3 for smaller values of f1. Two things are clear from this plot: the fixed point like behavior--reflected in the fact that for large f1 an equal change in mass requires a larger change in f1--and the decrease of the f1 fixed point with the increase of f3. This latter point is responsible for the curving to the right of the contours at high f1 values and was mentioned earlier with regards to Figure [\ref=Fig:f.FIXED.POINT].

As a final remark on the sleptons, notice that the contours in Figure [\ref=Fig:SLEPTON.MASS.CONTOUR] correpsonding to the suggest more stringent lower bounds on the seesaw couplings than the LEP II bounds. These are necessary so that the lightest neutralino will be the and therefore a possible dark matter candidate. The values indicated in the plot correspond to low energy values of the seesaw couplings that are only about 10% off from their fixed-point value, fc1,fc3,f1,f3  ~  0.6. Therefore, for succesful dark matter, the seesaw couplings can be expected to be larger than about 0.5. This can be checked by a quick calculation, since the lightest neutralino mass is approximately the wino mass (see Section [\ref=Sec:Ino]) and depends only on Fφ. Meanwhile, the selectron mass depends on [formula], which we can set equal to each other as an approximation, and Fφ. Given that the selectrons must be heavier then the , for a viable dark matter candidate, yields

[formula]

Squarks

Squark masses in decrease with energy due to the increase of SU(2)L and U(1)Y gauge couplings, which contribute negatively [\cite=Paige:1999ui] to their masses. At a certain energy scale, the negative contributions take over and the expressions for the squark soft masses become negative. In our case this happens at an earlier scale due to the increase size of the SU(2)L and U(1)Y beta functions from the extra triplet and the doubly charged fields. Normally we would have expected this to show up at high temperatures and lead to breakdown of color gauge symmetry. However, at high temperatures the vacuum of the theory is also affected by temperature corrections. Consequently the mass-square term of the squarks will have the form [formula]. The first term only grows logarithmically with temperature whereas the second term grows quadratically. The coefficient λ is positive so that the net effect is that [formula] remains positive at high temperature and leaving color gauge symmetry intact in the early universe.

It is also worth noting that because non-asymptotically free gauge couplings contribute negatively to masses, the right-handed squarks are slightly heavier than left-handed squarks. This is different than and where all gauge couplings yield positive contributions making left-handed squarks heavier, see Figure [\ref=Fig:particle.spectrum.bosons]. Furthermore, the squarks in this model can be degenerate with the sleptons.

Bosinos and the

Because all superpartners eventually decay into the , its makeup is an important part of collider phenomenology and dark matter prospects. Therefore understanding that makeup is an important task. Cosmological constraints rule out a charged or colored [\cite=Ellis:1983ew], hence limiting the choices to the sneutrino or the lightest neutralino. The former, in typical models, makes a poor dark matter candidate (relic abundances are too light; much of its mass range ruled out by direct detection [\cite=Caldwell:1988su] [\cite=Arina:2007tm]. It is therefore more interesting to consider the lightest neutralino as the , the candidate in common scenarios (except in where it is the next to lightest particle but has the same collider significance [\cite=Giudice:1998bp]).

The lightest neutralino will be some mixture of the wino, bino and Higgsino. Its gaugino composition follows from the gaugino mass ratio which is easily calculated and relatively independent of the point in parameter space. In this ratio depends on both the gauge couplings and the gauge coupling beta functions, b. The latter is important since this is where the effects of the light triplets and doubly-charged Higgs are felt (see Table [\ref=Table:VALUES.b] for b for values in LR-AMSB compare to based on particle content). It is calculated to be: M3:M2:M1  ~  1.3:1:1.3. The striking characteristic of this ratio is its degeneracy when compared to /, M3:M2:M1  ~  3:1:0.3 or even M3:M2:M1  ~  8:1:3.5.

Specifically then, the will have a large wino component where in it is all wino, and there will also be some non-negligible mixing with the bino. Note that in () the sole contribution to this ratio is from the gauge couplings and therefore the () is always mostly bino. The Higgsino contribution is not independent of other parameters and therefore is not as predictable, but numerical results show that it is typically a little bit lighter than the wino (its value decreases compared to the wino as Fφ is increased). Therefore, the will be some combination mostly Higgsino with significant wino content and and a little bit of bino. The mixed Higgsino state will correspond to χ02; χ03 and χ+2 will be mostly wino with some Higgsino (percent values will be complementary to those of χ1), and χ04 will be mostly bino.

An immediate consequence of the degeneracy of the gauginos is a more natural heavy , closer in mass to both the gluinos and squarks. Naturalness suggests that squark masses are not much larger than 1 TeV, to minimize fine tuning in the Higgs mass, therefore:

[formula]

yielding:

[formula]

This is a much larger value than the upper bound in [formula] GeV [\cite=Feng:1999hg] and therefore has less of its parameter spaced ruled out by experimental data.

Another point to consider is that the Higgsino and wino form isospin doublets and triplets with the appropriate charginos. Therefore when they play the role of the lightest neutralino, there is potential for a very small mass difference between the lightest neutralino and the lightest chargino. This is very pronounced in where the mass difference of the mostly wino neutralino and chargino is on the order of 100s of MeVs including leading radiative corrections. Analytical approximations for this quantity for large μ have been given in [\cite=Gherghetta:1999sw] [\cite=Feng:1999fu] [\cite=Feng:1999hg]. Such approximations are not as useful in LR-AMSB since the relevant mass scales: μ, M1, and M2 are relatively of the same order (the singlino contribution is much larger than these); however, an analytic expression for the minimum of the mass difference is attainable.

First note that a Higgsino mixing exists in the neutralino matrix, absent in the chargino sector. This mixing goes to zero as tan β  →  1 hence indicating that for tan β  =  1 the mass difference is minimal (when tan β  →  1 and tan θW  →  0 the global custodial SU(2) becomes an exact symmetry making the mass difference zero). The eigenvalues of the two matrices can than be expanded for tan β  =  1 using the approximation M1  ~  M2  >  μ  ≫  MZ, this yields, to first order:

[formula]

The second order term is positive definite so that Δ1 can in fact be used as a minimal value for the mass splitting. Notice that the Δ1  →  0 as tan θW  →  0 as argued above (and that Δ1  →  0 as M1  →    ∞   since this also restores the custodial symmetry when tan β  =  1.

The form of Eq. [\eqref=Eq:Ino.Mass.Difference] is convenient since the only free parameter it depends on is Fφ (through M1), which also controls the squark masses. Applying the natural upper bound for M1 from Eq. [\eqref=Eq:Naturalness.Gaugino.Masses] yields:

[formula]

This is larger than the value of a few 100s of MeV. Exact values for the mass difference are given in Figure [\ref=Fig:Ino.Mass.Difference] as a function of [formula] with: λ  =  0.26, tan β  =  3.25 and the singlino mass term [formula]. The line at 165 GeV represents the asymptotic value for large M2 in at the one loop level[\cite=Gherghetta:1999sw] and below the dotted line the squark masses are above a TeV and hence the Higgs mass becomes fined tuned.

Collider Signatures

The small size of Δ1 can potentially be problematic at a collider because the soft decay products, X, in the process χ+1  →  Xχ01, will not be visible. This is a feature shared by both LR-AMSB and . The difference is that the larger value of Δ1 for LR-AMSB might produce prospects of detection if X  =  τ or a hard μ; however, this advantage is counterbalanced by a faster chargino decay eliminating chances of long-lived charged tracks with no muon chamber activity. Regardless, similar situations have been analyzed and found to be manageable for both letpon colliders[\cite=Chen:1995yu] and the Tevatron [\cite=Feng:1999fu] [\cite=Gunion:1999jr].

On the other hand, studies of have focused on like signals [\cite=Baer:2000bs] [\cite=Paige:1999ui]. Such signals are heavily dependent on lepton final states and are based on left-handed squark decays to mostly wino charginos and neutralinos. These in turn can decay leptonically producing trilepton signals or same sign dilepton signals [\cite=Hinchliffe:1996iu] [\cite=Martin:1997ns], both of which have potentially manageable backgrounds. For in , though, the the wino states are the lightest and will not decay leptonically. Hence the the right-handed squarks take the place of the left-handed ones decaying into the mostly bino neutralino (which can decay leptonically). Yet, since there is no corresponding chargino to the bino, signals such as the trilepton and the same sign dilepton signal may not be possible.

The situation in LR-AMSB is more analogous to : right-handed squarks will decay to the which has some bino content. Meanwhile, the left-handed squarks may decay either to the lightest chargino/neutralino, or, more likely (because of their higher wino content), to χ03 and χ+2. These may then decay leptonically depending on the slepton masses (e.g f(vR)  =  1.4 in Table [\ref=Table:Spectrum]) giving the familiar signals: trilepton and same sign dilepton. Note that it is also possible that decay of χ+1 will produce leptonic signals since Δ1 is larger. These considerations would help differntiate this model from , while the degeneracies in the gaugino sector and same generation slepton will differentiate it from and . These differences between the various scenarios are summarized in Table [\ref=Table:Differences].

Triplets and Doubly-Charged Higgses

The interplay between and the left-handed and doubly-charged Higgses leads to interesting phenomenology and is worth summarizing here. Because they play the central role of saving the slepton masses from a tachyonic fate, their masses must be around the Fφ scale. This puts a bound on the right-handed scale scale, [formula] GeV, which is not the case when these particles appear in and [\cite=Dutta:1998bn] [\cite=Setzer:2006sf]. It is also possible, through mixing due to bilinear b-terms Eq. [\eqref=Eq:DC.Mass], that one triplet and one doubly charged Higgs will be light, [formula] and therefore accessible at the . Their presence would also be felt indirectly in upcoming muonium-antimuonium oscillation experiments since their couplings to first and second generation leptons must be large. For sleptons above the LEP II bound:

[formula]

and for sleptons above the lightest neutralino (for a good dark matter candidate):

[formula]

Based on Figure [\ref=Fig:f.FIXED.POINT.f3.Zero] and Figure [\ref=Fig:SLEPTON.MASS.CONTOUR]. On the other hand, all the triplet and doubly-charged Higgsinos will remain heavy, O(Fφ), and undetectable at the or low energy experiments.

Dark matter

As noted in the previous section, the in our model is a predominatly Higgsino wino mix with very little bino (about 1%). Since the annihilation rate for such an is large, its relic density from conventional annihilation arguments is not enough to explain the observed Ωm of the universe of 20%. This issue has been discussed earlier in ref.[\cite=Moroi:1999zb], according to which the decay of the gravitino in the late stage of the universe to non-thermal winos will generate enough density to make it a viable dark matter. A similar mechanism would work in this mostly Higgsino case since the crucial ingredients are similar: the mass (this a similar), its interactions with the gravitino (again, this is similar between the two cases because of the similar masses) and its annihilation rate (these are also the same since wino and Higgsino annihilation takes place through a t-channel chargino exchange proportional with α2 strength). Like [\cite=Moroi:1999zb], we have scanned over the parameters and found that such dark matter does evade current bounds on direct detection set by CDMS Soudan and EDELWEISS but will be detectable by future experiments.

Beyond vR

In this section, we comment on the ultraviolet behaviour of the theory. As we see from Figure [\ref=Fig:Gauge.Couplings] below, despite the new contributions to SU(2)L and U(1)Y beta functions, all couplings remain perturbative until about 1011-1012 GeV. Our effective field theory approach below this scale should hold without any problem. Once we are above this scale, the couplings could maintain perturbativity if there are extra dimensions[\cite=Dienes:1998vh] due to negative contributions from vector gauge KK modes of the theory if the inverse radius of the extra dimensions are around 1011 GeV or so. Such extra dimensions could also be the origin of the Planck suppressed operators that we have used in our discussion.

Conclusion

In summary, we have elaborated on our suggestion that minimally extending to account for neutrino masses in a way that R-parity remains an automatic symmetry of the theory allows for a solution to the tachyonic slepton problem of anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking. Interestingly, the solution requires that parity symmetry remain exact above the vR scale. Among the new results, we show how to obtain radiative electroweak symmetry breaking and a reasonable Bμ term in this class of models. We also discuss the sparticle spectrum of the model in detail and show how it differs from that of as well as other widely discussed supersymmetry scenarios. A new feature of this model is the presence of new TeV scale SU(2)L triplets and doubly charged SU(2)L singlet fields, whose phenomenology has been the subject of many papers [\cite=Dine:2007xi] [\cite=Han:2007bk] [\cite=Frank:2007nv] [\cite=Raidal:1998vi] [\cite=Barenboim:1996pt] [\cite=Akeroyd:2007zv]. We believe that the model discussed here is a serious alternative to the whose further phenomenological implications need to be explored in detail.

Notation Conventions

In this appendix we summarize our notational conventions. Given a superpotential defined as

[formula]

with a corresponding lagrangian of

[formula]

the anomalous dimensions, γij, and β-functions, βiL, βijμ, βijkY, at a given energy scale Q are defined by

[formula]

Furthermore, we choose the sign of the soft breaking terms by specifying that

[formula]

Between scales: vR To Fφ

The superpotential between the vR and Fφ scale is:

[formula]

Where a = 1,2, the Yukawa matrices have been approximated by the third generation diagonal term, the seesaw Yukawa couplings are diagonal and the subscript i represents lepton generation and is summed. The gamma functions for the theory between the vR and Fφ are:

[formula]

[formula]

These expressions were used for the slepton masses in Eqs. [\eqref=Eq:AMSB.Mass.Selectron.Right] and [\eqref=Eq:AMSB.Mass.Selectron.Left]. The third generation squark masses can also be written down (here we assume real yukawa couplings for simplicity):

[formula]

Were the first generation squark masses can be found by using the third generation mass expressions with yukawa couplings set to zero and [formula] for [formula]. Typically, the largest contribution to these are given by:

[formula]

The present LEP bound on the Higgs mass of 114 GeV can then roughly be translated to give a lower bound of about 600 GeV on the top squark mass. Using α3(Fφ)≃0.08 in the above expressions, we can translate this squark mass bound to a lower limit on Fφ of about 30 TeV. We have used this in all our calculations in the text.

Addendum

The purpose of this addendum is to clarify certain aspects of the detailed model implementing the idea described in the main body of the paper. We first show that the model defined in Eqs. [\eqref=Eq:SuperW.SUSYLR]-[\eqref=Eq:SuperW.SUSYLR.nr.gsv] has new diagrams at the Fφ scale that dominate the contributions noted in the text, making the sleptons tachyonic below Fφ. It is then noted that the model permits an additional term in the kähler potential that is crucial to restoring the low-energy phenomenology and leaves the presented results unaltered.

To elucidate the issues at the Fφ scale, it is useful to first consider a simplified model with a superpotential of

[formula]

and fields as defined in the text. The mass scales MΔ, MS are assumed to be of the same order as vR, the right-handed scale.

The superfields of Eq. [\eqref=Eq:Add.simple.superW.higgs] acquire a given by

[formula]

and, as expected, the s are proportional to φ indicating this is an preserving threshold. It is worth noting that preserving is a direct result of the superconformal invariance of the structure which is itself a result of the s being induced by terms that preserve the superconformal symmetry.

Now once the superfields are shifted by their s, the non-renormalizable terms give rise to an effective mass term for the (otherwise massless) doubly-charged fields:

[formula]

where [formula].

As discussed in the text, μDC  ≥  Fφ to avoid tachyonic doubly-charged particles; however, given the form of Eq. [\eqref=Eq:Add.simple.superW.mass.DC], it is evident the threshold associated with the doubly-charged particles also preserves , which is true even if it is at Fφ.

But μDC  ~  Fφ has additional threshold corrections to the remaining low-scale particles that are important[\cite=Dine:1996xk] [\cite=Katz:1999uw]. These effects are governed by the ratio

[formula]

which measures the splitting of the messenger scalar fields' masses due to breaking. The usual expressions for the low-scale particles are zero order in δ, and are dominant for μDC  ≫  Fφ; however, for μDC  ~  Fφ the one-loop yukawa-mediated contributions also become important. For the selectron, all such diagrams are shown in Figure [\ref=Fig:selectron.YMSB.delta.one.loop]. The sum of the graphs in Figure [\ref=Fig:selectron.YMSB.delta.one.loop] yield a scalar mass-squared correction of

[formula]

where the second expression takes μDC around Fφ. This expression is always negative and larger in magnitude than the expressions, which are suppressed by an additional factor of 1 / 16π2.

At this stage it would appear that combining the seesaw mechanism with has actually made the problem worse, since the sleptons are now 'more negative' by a factor of 16π2. This is not, however, the situation because the model itself permits additional terms that are not expressed in the superpotential. In fact, the full model of Eqs. [\eqref=Eq:SuperW.SUSYLR]-[\eqref=Eq:SuperW.SUSYLR.nr.gsv] allow the kähler potential term

[formula]

with k an order one constant.

A term such as Eq. [\eqref=Eq:Add.kahler.bilinear] has been studied before[\cite=Nelson:2002sa] [\cite=Hsieh:2006ig], and it was pointed out that it yields an effective superpotential term of

[formula]

The presence of this effective mass term then alters the mass matrix for the doubly-charged particles given in Eq. [\eqref=Eq:DC.Mass] to

[formula]

with μDC  ~  v2R / MX as before. Since k and μDC are free parameters (k is an arbitrary O(1) constant while μDC depends on the non-renormalizable couplings), Eq. [\eqref=Eq:Add.DC.mass.matrix] may be tuned so that all the fields are at [formula]:

[formula]

The tunings Eq. [\eqref=Eq:Add.DC.tuning] permit both the doubly-charged fermions and the doubly-charged scalars to remain in the theory to the TeV scale and retain the trajectory for all the particles. A similar argument allows the left-handed triplets to persist until [formula]. While both the doubly-charged scalars and fermions survive to the TeV scale, the muonium-antimuonium constraints given in Eq. [\eqref=Eq:DC.muonium.constraint] still force these particles' masses to be at or above 2 TeV. If they reside right near this lower bound, the may produce both doubly-charged scalars and fermions (as opposed to just the scalars as presented in the paper).

Because this new particle content survives to the TeV scale, the expression may be utilized at that scale to determine the soft masses. The presence of the new yukawa couplings f and fc for the sleptons will then cause them to be positive. In the analysis of Section [\ref=Sec:Sparticle.Masses], these expressions were evaluated at Fφ for both squarks and sleptons, then used as boundary conditions to evolve the masses down to [formula]. As the parameters do not run significantly from Fφ to [formula] (it is only two orders of magnitude), the numerical results presented in the paper remain valid within the expected uncertainty.

Note

After this paper was published, the authors were informed of [\cite=deAlwis:2008aq] which discusses an alternative scenario to avoiding tachyonic sleptons. The authors regret this omission and their oversight which prevented it appearing in the printed paper.
