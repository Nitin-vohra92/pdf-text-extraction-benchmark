Equivariant classification of 2-torus manifolds

Introduction

In this paper, we consider the equivariant classification of locally standard 2-torus manifolds. A 2-torus manifold is a closed smooth manifold of dimension n with an effective action of a 2-torus group [formula] of rank n, and it is said to be locally standard if it is locally isomorphic to a faithful representation of [formula] on [formula]. The orbit space Q of a locally standard 2-torus M by the action is a nice manifold with corners. When Q is a simple convex polytope, M is called a small cover and studied in [\cite=dj]. A typical example of a small cover is a real projective space [formula] with a standard action of [formula]. Its orbit space is an n-simplex. On the other hand, a typical example of a compact non-singular toric variety is a complex projective space [formula] with a standard action of [formula] where [formula]. [formula] has complex conjugation and its fixed point set is [formula]. More generally, any compact non-singular toric variety admits complex conjugation and its fixed point set often provides an example of a small cover. Similarly to the theory of toric varieties, an interesting connection among topology, geometry and combinatorics is discussed for small covers in [\cite=dj], [\cite=djs] and [\cite=ga-sc02]. Although locally standard 2-torus manifolds form a much wider class than small covers, one can still expect such a connection. See [\cite=l] for the study of 2-torus manifolds from the viewpoint of cobordism.

The orbit space Q of a locally standard 2-torus manifold M contains a lot of topological information on M. For instance, when Q is a simple convex polytope (in other words, when M is a small cover), the betti numbers of M (with [formula] coefficient) are described in terms of face numbers of Q ([\cite=dj]). This is not the case for a general Q, but the euler characteristic of M can be described in terms of Q (Theorem [\ref=euler]). Although Q contains a lot of topological information on M, Q is not sufficient to reproduce M, i.e., there are many locally standard 2-torus manifolds with the same orbit space in general. We need two data to reproduce M from Q. One is a characteristic function on Q introduced in [\cite=dj]. It is a map from the set of codimension-one faces of Q to [formula] satisfying a certain linearly independence condition. Roughly speaking, a characteristic function provides information on the set of non-free orbits in M. The other data is a principal [formula]-bundle over Q which provides information on the set of free orbits in M. It turns out that the orbit space Q together with these two data uniquely determines a locally standard 2-torus manifold up to equivariant homeomorphism (Lemma [\ref=form]). When Q is a simple convex polytope, any principal [formula]-bundle over it is trivial; so only a characteristic function matters in this case ([\cite=dj]).

The set of isomorphism classes in all principal [formula]-bundles over Q can be identified with [formula]. Let Λ(Q) be the set of all characteristic functions on Q. Then each element in [formula] determines a locally standard 2-torus manifold with orbit space Q. However, different elements in the product may produce equivariantly homeomorphic locally standard 2-torus manifolds. Let [formula] be the group of self-homeomorphisms of Q as a manifold with corners. It naturally acts on [formula] and one can see that equivariant homeomorphism classes in locally standard 2-torus manifolds with orbit space Q can be identified with the coset [formula], see Proposition [\ref=QGdiff].

It is not easy in general to count elements in the coset above, but we can manage when Q is a compact surface with only one boundary. In this case, codimension-one faces sit in the boundary circle, so a characteristic function on Q is nothing but a coloring on a circle (with vertices) with three colors.

The paper is organized as follows. In section [\ref=sect:2torus], we introduce the notion of locally standard 2-torus manifold and give several examples. Following Davis and Januszkiewicz [\cite=dj], we define a characteristic function and construct a locally standard 2-torus manifold from a characteristic function and a principal bundle in section [\ref=sect:chara]. In section [\ref=sect:euler] we describe the euler characteristic of a locally standard 2-torus manifold in terms of its orbit space. Section [\ref=sect:equiv] discusses three equivalence relations among locally standard 2-torus manifolds and identify them with some cosets. We count the number of colorings on a circle in section [\ref=sect:color]. Applying this result, we find in section [\ref=sect:2dim] the number of equivariant homeomorphism classes in locally standard 2-torus manifolds when the orbit space is a compact surface with only one boundary.

2-torus manifolds

We denote the quotient additive group [formula] by [formula] throughout this paper. The natural action of a 2-torus [formula] of rank n on [formula] defined by

[formula]

is called the standard representation of [formula]. The orbit space is a positive cone [formula]. Any real n-dimensional faithful representation of [formula] is obtained from the standard representation by composing a group automorphism of [formula], up to isomorphism. Therefore the orbit space of the faithful representation space can also be identified with [formula].

A 2-torus manifold M is a closed smooth manifold of dimension n with an effective smooth action of [formula]. We say that M is locally standard if for each point x in M, there is a [formula]-invariant neighborhood Vx of x such that Vx is equivariantly homeomorphic to an invariant open subset of a real n-dimensional faithful representation space of [formula].

The notion of a torus manifold is introduced in [\cite=ha-ma03]. It is a closed smooth manifold of dimension 2n with an effective smooth action of a compact n-dimensional torus (S1)n having a fixed point. (More precisely speaking, an orientation data on M called an omniorientation in [\cite=bp] is incorporated in the definition.) There is also a notion of local standardness in this setting ([\cite=dj]). Although many interesting examples of torus manifolds are locally standard (e.g. this is the case for compact non-singular toric varieties with restricted action of the compact torus, more generally for torus manifolds with vanishing odd degree cohomology, [\cite=ma-pa03]), the local standardness is not assumed in the study of [\cite=ha-ma03] and [\cite=m] because a combinatorial object called a multi-fan can be defined without assuming it. However, the existence of a fixed point is not assumed for a 2-torus manifold unlike a torus manifold.

For a locally standard 2-torus manifold M, the orbit space Q of M naturally becomes a manifold with corners (see [\cite=d2] for the details of a manifold with corners). Therefore the notion of a face can be defined for Q. In this paper we assume that a face is connected. We call a face of dimension 0 a vertex, a face of dimension one an edge and a codimension-one face a facet.

An n-dimensional convex polytope P is said to be simple if exactly n facets meet at each of its vertices. Each point of a simple convex polytope P has a neighborhood which is affine isomorphic to an open subset of the positive cone [formula], so P is an n-dimensional manifold with corners. A locally standard 2-torus manifold M is said to be a small cover when its orbit space is a simple convex polytope, see [\cite=dj].

We call a closed, connected, codimension-one submanifold of M characteristic if it is a connected component of the set fixed pointwise by some [formula] subgroup. Since M is compact, M has only finitely many characteristic submanifolds. The action of [formula] is free outside the union of all characteristic submanifolds, in other words, a point of M with non-trivial isotropy subgroup is contained in some characteristic submanifold of M.

Through the quotient map M  →  Q, a fixed point in M corresponds to a vertex of Q and a characteristic submanifold of M corresponds to a facet of Q. A connected component of the intersection of k characteristic submanifolds of M corresponds to a codimension-k face of Q, so a codimension-k face of Q is a connected component of the intersection of k facets. In particular, any codimension-two face of Q is a connected component of the intersection of two facets of Q, which means that Q is nice, see [\cite=d2].

We shall give examples of locally standard 2-torus manifolds.

If M is a locally standard 2-torus manifold of dimension n and a subgroup of [formula] has an isolated fixed point, then the isolated point must be fixed by the entire group [formula]. This follows from the local standardness of M. The following is an example of a closed n-manifold with an effective [formula]-action which is not a locally standard 2-torus manifold.

Characteristic functions and principal bundles

Let Q be an n-dimensional nice manifold with corners. We denote by F(Q) the set of facets of Q. A codimension-k face of Q is a connected component of the intersection of k facets. We call a map

[formula]

a characteristic function on Q if it satisfies the following linearly independent condition:

if a codimension-k face F of Q is a connected component of the intersection of k facets [formula], then [formula] are linearly independent when viewed as vectors of the vector space [formula] over the field [formula].

We denote by GF the subgroup of [formula] generated by [formula].

When n  ≤  2, it is easy to see that any Q admits a characteristic function. When n = 3, Q admits a characteristic function if the boundary of Q is a union of 2-spheres, which follows from the Four Color Theorem, but Q may not admit a characteristic function otherwise. When n  ≥  4, there is a simple convex polytope which admits no characteristic function, see [\cite=dj].

A characteristic function arises naturally from a locally standard 2-torus manifold M of dimension n with orbit space Q. A facet of Q is the image of a characteristic submanifold of M by the quotient map π:M  →  Q. To each element F∈F(Q) we assign the nonzero element of [formula] which fixes pointwise the characteristic submanifold π- 1(F). The local standardness of M implies that this assignment satisfies the linearly independent condition above required for a characteristic function.

Besides the characteristic function, a principal [formula]-bundle over Q will be associated with M as follows. We take a small invariant open tubular neighborhood for each characteristic submanifold of M and remove their union from M. Then the [formula]-action on the resulting space is free and its orbit space can naturally be identified with Q, so it gives a principal [formula]-bundle over Q.

We have associated a characteristic function and a principal [formula]-bundle with a locally standard 2-torus manifold. Conversely, one can reproduce the locally standard 2-torus manifold from these two data. This is done by Davis-Januszkiewicz [\cite=dj] when Q is a simple convex polytope, but their construction still works in our setting. Let ξ = (E,κ,Q), where κ:E  →  Q, be a principal [formula]-bundle over Q and let [formula] be a characteristic function on Q. We define an equivalence relation ~   on E as follows: for u1,u2∈E

[formula]

where F is the face of Q containing κ(u1) = κ(u2) in its relative interior and GF is the subgroup of [formula] defined at the beginning of this section. Then the quotient space E /   ~  , denoted by M(ξ,λ), naturally inherits the [formula]-action from E.

The following is proved in [\cite=dj] when Q is a simple convex polytope, but the same proof works in our setting.

If a locally standard 2-torus manifold M over Q has ξ as the associated principal [formula]-principal bundle and λ as the characteristic function, then there is an equivariant homeomorphism from M(ξ,λ) to M which covers the identity on Q.

Euler characteristic of a locally standard 2-torus manifold

The following formula describes the euler characteristic χ(M) of a locally standard 2-torus manifold M in terms of its orbit space.

If M is a locally standard 2-torus manifold over Q, then

[formula]

where F runs over all faces of Q.

As observed in Section [\ref=sect:chara], M is the disjoint union of 2dim F copies of [formula] over all faces F of Q. This implies the former identity in the theorem. The latter identity is well-known. In fact, it follows from the homology exact sequence for a pair (F,∂F).

When dim M = 2, Q is a surface with boundary and each boundary component is a circle with at least two vertices if it has a vertex.

If dim M = 2 and Q has m vertices, then χ(M) = 4χ(Q) - m.

Since ∂Q is a union of circles, χ(Q,∂Q) = χ(Q). If a boundary circle has no vertex, then it is an edge without boundary and its euler characteristic is zero. So we may neglect it. If F is an edge with a vertex, then it has two endpoints and χ(F,∂F) = χ(F) - χ(∂F) =  - 1, and if F is a vertex, then χ(F,∂F) = χ(F) = 1. Since the number of edges with a vertex and the number of vertices are both m, it follows from Theorem [\ref=euler] that

[formula]

When dim M = 2, it is not difficult to see that M is orientable if and only if Q is orientable and the characteristic function [formula] associated with M assigns exactly two elements to each boundary component of Q with a vertex, cf. [\cite=na-ni05]. Therefore one can find the homeomorphism type of M from the corollary above and the characteristic function λ.

Classification of locally standard 2-torus manifolds

In this section we introduce three notions of equivalence in locally standard 2-torus manifolds over Q and identify each set of equivalence classes with a coset of [formula] by some action.

Following Davis and Januszkiewicz [\cite=dj] we say that two locally standard 2-torus manifolds M and M' over Q are equivalent if there is a homeomorphism f:M  →  M' together with an element [formula] such that

f(gx) = σ(g)f(x) for all [formula] and x∈M, and

f induces the identity on the orbit space Q.

When we classify locally standard 2-torus manifolds up to the above equivalence, it suffices to consider locally standard 2-torus manifolds of the form M(ξ,λ) by Lemma [\ref=form]. We denote by ξσ the principal [formula]-bundle ξ with [formula]-action through [formula]. Then it would be obvious that M(ξ',λ') is equivalent to M(ξ,λ) if and only if there exists [formula] such that ξ' = ξσ and [formula].

We denote by P(Q) the set of all principal [formula]-bundles over Q. Since the classifying space of [formula] is an Eilenberg-Maclane space [formula], P(Q) can naturally be identified with [formula] and the action of σ sending ξ to ξσ is nothing but the action on [formula] induced from the automorphism σ on the coefficient [formula]. With this understood, the above fact implies the following.

The set of equivalence classes in locally standard 2-torus manifolds over Q bijectively corresponds to the coset

[formula]

by the diagonal action.

The action of [formula] on [formula] is free when Q has a vertex by the following lemma.

If Q has a vertex, then the action of [formula] on Λ(Q) is free and [formula].

Suppose that [formula] for some λ∈Λ(Q) and [formula]. Take a vertex of Q and let [formula] be the facets of Q meeting at the vertex. Then

[formula]

Since the matrix [formula] is non-singular, σ is the identity matrix. This proves the former statement in the lemma. Then the latter statement follows from the well-known fact that [formula], see [\cite=al-be95].

Lemma [\ref=free] is also helpful to count the number of elements in Λ(Q). Here is an example.

Another natural equivalence relation among locally standard 2-torus manifolds is equivariant homeomorphism. An automorphism of Q is a self-homeomorphism of Q as a manifold with corners, and we denote the group of automorphisms of Q by [formula]. Similarly, an automorphism of F(Q) is a bijection from F(Q) to itself which preserves the poset structure of F(Q) defined by inclusions of faces, and we denote the group of automorphisms of F(Q) by [formula]. An automorphism of Q induces an automorphism of F(Q), so we have a natural homomorphism

[formula]

We note that [formula] acts on Λ(Q) by sending λ∈Λ(Q) to [formula] for [formula].

M(ξ,λ) is equivariantly homeomorphic to M(ξ',λ') if and only if there is an [formula] such that [formula] and h*(ξ') = ξ in P(Q), where h*(ξ') denotes the bundle induced from ξ' by h.

If M(ξ,λ) is equivariantly homeomorphic to M(ξ',λ'), then there is an equivariant homeomorphism H:M(ξ',λ')  →  M(ξ,λ) and it is easy to see that the automorphism of Q induced from H is the desired h in the theorem.

Conversely, suppose that there is an h∈Λ(Q) such that [formula] and ξ' = h*(ξ) in P(Q). Then there is a bundle map :ξ'  →  ξ which covers h, and [formula] descends to a map H from M(ξ',λ') to M(ξ,λ) because [formula]. It is not difficult to see that H is an equivariant homeomorphism.

[formula] naturally acts on [formula] and the canonical bijection between P(Q) and [formula] is equivariant with respect to the actions of [formula].

The set of equivariant homeomorphism classes in all locally standard 2-torus manifolds over Q bijectively corresponds to the coset

[formula]

by the diagonal action of [formula]. If Q is a simple convex polytope, then the set of equivariant homeomorphism classes in all small covers over Q bijectively corresponds to the coset [formula].

The former statement in the proposition follows from Lemma [\ref=Gdiff]. If Q is a simple polytope, then [formula]. Therefore, the latter statement in the proposition follows if we prove that the map Φ in ([\ref=Phi]) is surjective when Q is a simple convex polytope.

A simple polytope Q has a simplicial polytope Q* as its dual and the face poset F(Q) is same as F(Q*) with reversed inclusion relation. Therefore [formula]. Since Q* is simplicial, an element φ of [formula] is realized by a simplicial automorphism on the boundary of Q*, so it extends to an automorphism of Q*. Since Q is dual to Q*, the automorphism of Q* determines a bijection on the vertex set of Q and hence an automorphism of Q which induces the chosen φ.

Our last equivalence relation is a combination of the previous two relations. We say that two locally standard 2-torus manifolds M and M' over Q are weakly equivariantly homeomorphic if there is a homeomorphism f:M  →  M' together with [formula] such that f(gx) = σ(g)f(x) for any [formula] and x∈M. We note that f induces an automorphism of Q but it may not be the identity on Q. The observation above shows that M(ξ,λ) and M(ξ',λ') are weakly equivariantly homeomorphic if and only if there are [formula] and [formula] such that ξ' = h*(ξσ) and [formula]. It follows that

The set of weakly equivariant homeomorphism classes in locally standard 2-torus manifolds over Q bijectively corresponds to the double coset

[formula]

by the diagonal actions of [formula] and [formula]. If Q is a simple convex polytope, then the set of weakly equivariant homeomorphism classes in small covers over Q bijectively corresponds to the double coset

[formula]

When Q is a right-angled regular hyperbolic polytope (such Q is the dodecahedron, the 120-cell or an m-gon with m  ≥  5), it is shown in [\cite=ga-sc02] that the double coset ([\ref=doub]) agrees with the set of hyperbolic structures in small covers over Q. This together with Mostow rigidity implies that when dim Q  ≥  3, that is, when Q is the dodecahedron or the 120-cell, the double coset ([\ref=doub]) agrees with the set of homeomorphism classes in small covers over Q ([\cite=ga-sc02]), i.e., the natural surjective map from the double coset to the set of homeomorphism classes in small covers over Q is bijective for such Q. However, this last statement does not hold for an m-gon Q with m  ≥  6 although it holds for m = 3,4,5, see the remark following Example [\ref=Cm] in the next section.

Enumeration of colorings on a circle

When dim Q = 2, each boundary component is a circle with at least two vertices if it has a vertex, and any two non-zero elements in [formula] form a basis of [formula]; so a characteristic function on Q is equivalent to coloring arcs on the boundary circles with three colors in such a way that any two adjacent arcs have different colors.

Let S(m) be a circle with m (  ≥  2) vertices. A coloring on S(m) (with three colors) means to color arcs of S(m) in such a way that any adjacent arcs have different colors. We denote by Λ(m) the set of all colorings on S(m) and set

[formula]

A(m) = 2m + ( - 1)m2.

Let L(m) be a segment with m + 1 vertices including the endpoints, so L(m) has m segments. The number of coloring segments of L(m) with three colors in such a way that any adjacent segments have different colors is 3  ·  2m - 1. If the two end segments have different colors, then it produces a coloring on S(m) by gluing the end points of L(m). If the two end segments have the same color, then it produces a coloring on S(m - 1) by gluing the end segments of L(m). Thus, we have that

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

and a simple observation shows that A(3) = A(2) = 6, so

[formula]

The lemma then follows from ([\ref=Am1]) and ([\ref=Am2]).

We think of S(m) as the unit circle of [formula] with m vertices e2πk / m [formula]. Let [formula] be the dihedral group of order 2m consisting of m rotations of [formula] by angles 2πk / m [formula] and m reflections with respect to lines in [formula] obtained by rotating the real axis by angles πk / m [formula]. Then the action of [formula] on S(m) preserves the vertices so that [formula] acts on the set Λ(m). With this understood we have

Let φ denote the Euler's totient function, that is, φ(1) = 1 and φ(N) for a positive integer N(  ≥  2) is the number of positive integers both less than N and coprime to N. Then

[formula]

The famous Burnside Lemma or Cauchy-Frobenius Lemma (see [\cite=al-be95]) says that if G is a finite group and X is a finite G-set, then

[formula]

where Xg denotes the set of g-fixed points in X. We apply this formula to our [formula]-set Λ(m). Let [formula] be the rotation by angle 2π / m and [formula] be the reflection with respect to the real axis. Then we have

[formula]

Here, if d is the greatest common divisor of k and m, then Λ(m)ak  =  Λ(m)ad because the subgroup generated by ak is same as that by ad. Since Λ(m)ad  =  Λ(d) and Λ(1) is empty, we have

[formula]

On the other hand, since akb is a reflection with respect to the line in [formula] obtained by rotating the real axis by angle πk / m, we have

[formula]

Putting ([\ref=eq2]) and ([\ref=eq3]) into ([\ref=eq1]), we obtain the formula in the theorem.

The same argument as above works for coloring S(m) with s colors. In this case the identity in Lemma [\ref=A(m)] turns into

[formula]

and if we denote by Λs(m) the set of all coloring on S(m) with s colors, then the formula in Theorem [\ref=B(m)] turns into

[formula]

The computation of [formula] can be done in a similar fashion to the above but is rather complicated. We note that the action of [formula] on Λ(m) is permutation of the 3 colors used to color S(m). [formula] consists of 6 elements and three of them are of order 2 and two of them is of order 3.

Let α and β be the functions defined as follows:

[formula]

Then [formula] is given by

[formula]

where (m / d,6) denotes the greatest common divisor of m / d and 6, A(q) = 2q + ( - 1)q2 as before, and

[formula]

Applying the Burnside Lemma to our [formula]-set [formula], we have

[formula]

We need to analyze |Γ(m)ad| with d|m and |Γ(m)akb|.

First we shall treat |Γ(m)ad| with d|m. Note that λ∈Λ(m) is a representative of Γ(m)ad if and only if there is [formula] such that

[formula]

Since ad is of order m / d, the repeated use of ([\ref=lambda]) shows that

[formula]

The identity ([\ref=lambda]) implies that the λ satisfying ([\ref=lambda]) can be determined by the coloring restricted to the union of a consecutive d arcs, say T, and it also tells us how to recover λ from the coloring on T.

Let μ be a coloring on T. We shall count colorings λ on S(m) which are extensions of μ and satisfy ([\ref=lambda]) for some [formula]. To each σ satisfying ([\ref=order]), there is a unique extension to S(m) which satisfies ([\ref=lambda]). However, the extended one may not be a coloring, i.e., two arcs meeting at a junction of T and its translations by rotations (ad)r [formula] may have the same color. Let t and t' be the end arcs of T such that the rotation of t by ad - 1 is t'. (Note: When d = 1, we understand t = t' and then the subsequent argument works.) The extended one is a coloring if and only if

[formula]

As is easily checked, the number of σ satisfying conditions ([\ref=order]) and ([\ref=sigma]) is α((m / d,6)) if [formula] and is β((m / d,6)) if μ(t) = μ(t'). On the other hand, the number of μ with [formula] is A(d) and that with μ(t) = μ(t') is A(d - 1). It follows that the number of λ satisfying ([\ref=lambda]) for some σ is α((m / d,6))A(d) + β((m / 6,d))A(d - 1). This proves that

[formula]

since the action of [formula] on Λ(m) is free by Lemma [\ref=free] and the order of [formula] is 6.

Next we shall treat |Γ(m)akb|. The argument is similar to the above. As before, λ∈Λ(m) is a representative of Γ(m)akb if and only if there is [formula] such that

[formula]

Since akb is of order two, the repeated use of ([\ref=lambda2]) shows that

[formula]

Suppose that m is odd. Then the line fixed by akb goes through a vertex, say v, of S(m) and the midpoint of the arc, say e', of S(m) opposite to the vertex v. Let H be the union of (m + 1) / 2 consecutive arcs starting from v and ending at e'. Let e be the other end arc of H different from e'. The arc e has v as a vertex. Let ν be a coloring on H and let [formula] satisfy ([\ref=order2]). Then ν has an extension to a coloring of S(m) satisfying ([\ref=lambda2]) if and only if It follows that ν(e) must be different from ν(e') and there is only one σ satisfying the two identities above for each such ν. Since the number of ν with [formula] is A((m + 1) / 2), so is the number of λ∈Λ(m) satisfying ([\ref=lambda2]) for some σ. It follows that [formula] and hence

[formula]

Suppose that m is even and k is odd. Then the line fixed by akb goes through the midpoints of two opposite arcs, say e and e', of S(m). Let H be the union of consecutive m / 2 + 1 arcs starting from e and ending at e'. Let ν be a coloring on H and let [formula] satisfy ([\ref=order2]). Then ν has an extension to a coloring of S(m) satisfying ([\ref=lambda2]) if and only if

[formula]

If [formula] then such σ must be the identity, and if ν(e) = ν(e') then there are two such σ one of which is the identity. Since the number of ν with [formula] is A(m / 2 + 1) and that with ν(e) = ν(e') is A(m / 2), the number of λ∈Λ(m) satisfying ([\ref=lambda2]) for some σ is A(m / 2 + 1) + 2A(m / 2). It follows that

[formula]

Suppose that m is even and k is even. Then the line fixed by akb goes through two opposite vertices, say v and v', of S(m). Let H be the union of consecutive m / 2 arcs starting from v and ending at v'. Let e and e' be the end arcs of H which respectively have v and v' as a vertex. Let ν be a coloring on H and let [formula] satisfy ([\ref=order2]). Then ν has an extension to a coloring of S(m) satisfying ([\ref=lambda2]) if and only if

[formula]

If [formula] then there is only one such σ, and if ν(e) = ν(e') then there are two such σ. Since the number of ν with [formula] is A(m / 2) and that with ν(e) = ν(e') is A(m / 2 - 1), the number of λ∈Λ(m) satisfying ([\ref=lambda2]) for some σ is A(m / 2) + 2A(m / 2 - 1). It follows that

[formula]

Thus, when m is even, it follows from ([\ref=akbod]) and ([\ref=akbev]) that

[formula]

where we used A(q) = 2q + ( - 1)q2 at the latter identity.

The theorem now follows from ([\ref=dcoset]), ([\ref=gamma]), ([\ref=akbmod]) and ([\ref=akbmev]).

When m is even, Λ(m) contains exactly three colorings with two colors and it defines the unique element in the double coset [formula].

We conclude this section with a remark. When Q is an m-gon (m  ≥  3), a small cover over Q is a closed surface with euler characteristic 4 - m and the cardinality of the set of homeomorphism classes in small covers over Q is one (resp. two) when m is odd (resp. even). On the other hand, the double coset ([\ref=doub]) agrees with [formula] and we see from Theorem [\ref=C(m)] that its cardinality is strictly larger than 2 when m  ≥  6. So, the natural surjective map from the double coset ([\ref=doub]) to the set of homeomorphism classes in small covers over Q is not injective when Q is an m-gon with m  ≥  6. However, it is bijective when m = 3,4,5, see Example [\ref=Cm].

Locally standard 2-torus manifolds of dimension two

We shall enumerate the number of equivariant homeomorphism classes in locally standard 2-torus manifolds with orbit space Q when Q is a compact surface with only one boundary.

Suppose that Q is a compact surface with only one boundary component with m (  ≥  2) vertices and set

[formula]

Then the number of equivariant homeomorphism classes in locally standard 2-torus manifolds over Q is h(Q)B(m), where [formula] is the number discussed in the previous section.

By Corollary [\ref=QGdiff] it suffices to count the number of orbits in [formula] under the diagonal action of [formula]. Since Q has only one boundary component and m vertices, Λ(Q) can be identified with Λ(m) in Section [\ref=sect:color] and [formula] is isomorphic to the dihedral group [formula].

Let H be the normal subgroup of [formula] which acts on [formula] trivially. We claim that the restriction of the natural homomorphism

[formula]

to H is still surjective. An automorphism of Q (as a manifold with corners) which rotates the boundary circle and fixes the exterior of its neighborhood is an element of H. Therefore H contains all rotations in [formula]. It is not difficult to see that any closed surface admits an involution which has one-dimensional fixed point component and acts trivially on the cohomology with [formula] coefficient. Since Q is obtained from a closed surface by removing an invariant open disk centered at a point in the one-dimensional fixed point set, Q admits an involution which reflects the boundary circle and lies in H. This implies the claim.

Let K be the kernel of the homomorphism [formula]. Then

[formula]

For any element g in [formula], there is an element h in H such that gh lies in K because the map ([\ref=surj]) restricted to H is surjective. Since H acts trivially on [formula], this shows that an [formula]-orbit in [formula] is same as an K-orbit. This means that the induced action of [formula] on [formula] is trivial. Therefore the right hand side at ([\ref=set]) reduces to

[formula]

Here the first factor is h(Q) by definition and the second one agrees with [formula] because of the surjectivity of the map ([\ref=surj]), proving the theorem.
