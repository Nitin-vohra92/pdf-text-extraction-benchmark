Unitary super perfect numbers

Introduction

We denote by σ(N) the sum of divisors of N. N is called to be perfect if σ(N) = 2N. It is a well-known unsolved problem whether or not an odd perfect number exists. Interest to this problem has produced many analogous notions.

D. Suryanarayana [\cite=Sur] called N to be super perfect if σ(σ(N)) = 2N. It is asked in this paper and still unsolved whether there were odd super perfect numbers.

A special class of divisors is the class of unitary divisors defined by Cohen [\cite=Coh]. A divisor d of n is called a unitary divisor if (d,n / d) = 1. Then we write d||n. We denote by σ*(N) the sum of unitary divisors of N. Replacing σ by σ*, Subbarao and Warren [\cite=SW] introduced the notion of a unitary perfect number. N is called to be unitary perfect if σ*(N) = 2N. They proved that there are no odd unitary perfect numbers. Moreover, Subbarao [\cite=Sub] conjectured that there are only finitely many unitary perfect numbers.

Combining these two notions, Sitaramaiah and Subbarao [\cite=SS] studied unitary super perfect (USP) numbers, integers N satisfying σ*(σ*(N)) = 2N. They found all unitary super perfect numbers below 108. The first ones are 2,9,165,238. Thus there are both even and odd USPs. They proved that another odd USP must have at least four distinct prime factors and conjectured that there are only finitely many odd USPs.

The purpose of this paper is to prove this conjecture. Indeed, we show that the known two USPs are all.

If N is an odd USP, then N = 9 or N = 165.

Our proof is completely elementary. The key point of our proof is the fact that if N is an odd USP, then σ*(N) must be of the form 2f1qf2, where q is an odd prime. This yields that if pe is an unitary divisor of N, then pe + 1 must be of the form 2aqb. Moreover, elementary theory of cyclotomic polynomials and quadratic residues gives that a  ≤  2 or b = 0. Hence pe belongs a to very thin set. Using this fact, we deduces that q must be small. For each small primes q, we show that σ*(σ*(N)) / N < 2 and therefore N cannot be an USP unless N = 9,165, with the aid of the fact that f1,f2 must be fairly large. We sometimes use facts already stated in [\cite=SS] but we shall present proofs of these facts when proofs are omitted in [\cite=SS].

Our method does not seem to work to find all odd super perfect numbers. Since σ(σ(N)) = 2N does not seem to imply that ω(σ(N))  ≤  2. Even assuming that ω(σ(N))  ≤  2, the property of σ that σ(pe) / pe > 1 + 1 / p prevents us from showing that σ(σ(N)) < 2. Nevertheless, with the aid of a theory of exponential diophantine equations, we can show that for any given k, there are only finitely many odd super perfect numbers N with ω(σ(N))  ≤  k.

Preliminary Lemmas

Let us denote by vp(n) the solution e of pe||n. For distinct primes p and q, we denote by oq(p) the exponent of p mod q and we define aq(p) = vq(pd - 1), where d = oq(p). Clearly oq(p) divides q - 1 and aq(p) is a positive integer. Now we quote some elementary properties of vq(σ(px)). Lemmas [\ref=lm21] is well-known. Lemma [\ref=lm21] has been proved by Zsigmondy[\cite=Zsi] and rediscovered by many authors such as Dickson[\cite=Dic] and Kanold[\cite=Kan]. See also Theorem 6.4A.1 in [\cite=Sha].

If a > b  ≥  1 are coprime integers, then an - bn has a prime factor which does not divide am - bm for any m < n, unless (a,b,n) = (2,1,6) or a - b = n = 1, or n = 2 and a + b is a power of 2.

By Lemma [\ref=lm21], we obtain the following lemmas.

Let p, q be odd primes and e be a positive integer. If pe + 1 = 2aqb for some integers a and b, then one of the following holds:

a)e = 1.

b)e is even and [formula].

c)p is a Mersenne prime and [formula].

We first show that if a) does not hold, then either b) or c) must hold. Since (p,e)  ≠  (2,3) and e  ≠  1, it follows from Lemma [\ref=lm21] that p2e - 1 has a prime factor r which does not divide pm - 1 for any m < 2e. Since the order of p mod r is 2e, [formula]. Since r is odd and does not divide pe - 1, we r divides pe + 1 and therefore q = r.

If e is even, then b) holds. Assume that e is odd. If p + 1 has an odd prime factor, then this cannot be equal to q and must be a prime factor of pe + 1 = 2aqb, which is contradiction. Thus p is a Mersenne prime and c) follows.

Let p be an odd prime and e be a positive integer. If pe + 1 = 2a3b for some integers a and b, then e = 1.

By Lemma [\ref=lm22], e = 1 or [formula]. The latter is equivalent to e = 1.

Let p, be an odd prime and e,x be positive integers. If pe + 1 = 2x, then e = 1.

If e > 1, then by Lemma [\ref=lm21], p2e - 1 has a prime factor which does not divide pm - 1 for any m < 2e. This prime factor must be odd and divide pe + 1, which violates the condition pe + 1 = 2x.

Let p, be an odd prime and e,x be positive integers. If 2x + 1 = 3e, then (e,x) = (1,1) or (2,3).

We apply Lemma [\ref=lm21] with (a,b,n) = (3,1,e). If e > 2, then 3e - 1 has a prime factor which does not divide 3 - 1 = 2.

If a prime p divides 2a + 1 for some integer a, then p is congruent to 1,3 or 5 mod 8.

If a is even, then it is well known that [formula]. If a is odd, then p divides 2x2 + 1 with x = 2(a - 1) / 2. We have ( - 2 / p) = 1 and therefore [formula] or 3 mod 8.

Let p and q be odd primes and b be a positive integer. If a prime p divides qb + 1 and 4 does not divide qb + 1, then 4q does not divide p + 1.

If b is even, then [formula] and clearly 4q does not divide p + 1.

If b is odd, then we have ( - q / p) = 1 and [formula]. Assume that q divides p + 1. Since [formula], we have, by the reciprocity law, ( - q / p) = ( - 1 / p)(q / p) = ( - 1 / p)(p / q) = ( - 1 / p)( - 1 / q) = ( - 1 / p). Thus ( - 1 / p) = 1 and [formula] and therefore 4 does not divide p + 1.

Basic properties of odd USPs

In this section, we shall show some basic properties of odd USPs.

We write [formula], where [formula] are distinct primes. Moreover, we denote by C the constant

[formula]

This upper bound follows from the following estimate:

[formula]

If N is an odd USP, then σ*(N) = 2f1qf2 for some odd prime q and positive integers f1,f2. Moreover, qf2 + 1 is not divisible by 4.

Since N is odd, σ*(N) must be even. Moreover, since σ*(σ*(N)) = 2N with N odd, σ*(N) has exactly one odd prime factor. Hence σ*(N) = 2f1qf2 for some odd prime q and positive integers f1,f2. Since σ*(qf2) = qf2 + 1 divides σ*(σ*(N)) = 2N, 4 does not divide qf2 + 1.

Henceforth, we let N  ≠  9,165 be an odd USP and write σ*(N) = 2f1qf2 as allowed by Lemma [\ref=lm31].

Unless pi is a Mersenne prime and ei is odd, we have peii = 2aiqbi - 1 for some positive integers ai and bi with ai  ≤  2. Moreover, [formula] and [formula].

Since σ*(peii + 1) divides σ*(N) = 2f1qf2, we can write peii + 1 = 2aiqbi with some nonnegative integers ai and bi. Since pi is odd and non-Mersenne, ai and bi are positive by Lemma [\ref=lm24].

If ei is even, then [formula]. Hence ai = 1.

Assume that pi is not a Mersenne prime and ei is odd. By Lemma [\ref=lm22], we have ei = 1 and therefore pi = peii = 2aiqbi - 1. By Lemma [\ref=lm26] and [\ref=lm27], we have ai  ≤  2 since qf2 + 1 is not divisible by 4. This shows ai  ≤  2. The latter part of the lemma immediately follows from [formula].

ω(N)  ≥  3.

First we assume that N = pe11. Since we have σ*(N) / N = 1 + 1 / N and σ*(σ*(N)) / σ*(N)  ≤  (1 + 1 / 2)(1 + 2 / N) by Lemma [\ref=lm31], we have N  ≤  9. We can easily confirm that N = 9 is the sole odd USP with N  ≤  9.

Next we assume that N = pe11pe22. Since we have σ*(N) / N  ≤  (1 + 1 / 3)(1 + 3 / N) and σ*(σ*(N)) / σ*(N)  ≤  (1 + 1 / 4)(1 + 4 / N), we have N < 37. We can easily confirm that there is no odd USP N with N < 37 and ω(N) = 2.

Another proof of impossibility of ω(N) = 1 unless N = 2,9 (whether N is even or odd) can be found in [\cite=SS] and impossibility of ω(N) = 2 (again, N may be even) is stated in [\cite=SS] with their proof presented only in the case N is even.

q cannot be 3

In this section, we show that q  ≠  3. There are two cases: the case 3|N and the case [formula].

If [formula] and 3|σ*(N), then f1 and f2 are even, pi has the form 2  ·  3bi - 1 with positive integers bi.

We have ei = 1 by Lemma [\ref=lm23]. Thus any pi must be of the form 2ai  ·  3bi - 1 with nonnegative integers ai,bi. Since 3f2 + 1 is not divisible by 4, f2 must be even. Since 3 does not divide 2f1 + 1, f1 must also be even. By Lemma [\ref=lm26], any prime factor of N is congruent to 1 mod 4 and therefore ai must be odd. By Lemma [\ref=lm32], we have ai = 1.

Hence we have [formula].

If 3|σ*(N), then 3|N.

Suppose 3|σ*(N) and [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=pr41], we have

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Since k  ≥  3 by Lemma [\ref=lm34], we have f1 = k  ≥  3 and f2  ≥  3 + 2 + 1 = 6. Thus we obtain

[formula]

Multiplying ([\ref=eq41]) and ([\ref=eq42]), we obtain

[formula]

which is contradiction.

It is impossible that 3|N and 3|σ*(N).

Suppose 3|N and 3|σ*(N). We have ei = 1 by Lemma [\ref=lm23]. By Lemma [\ref=lm26], 2ai + 1 is divisible by no Mersenne prime other than 3. Since 3bi + 1 cannot be divisible by 4, bi must be odd and therefore 3bi + 1 is divisible by no Mersenne prime. Hence it follows from Lemma [\ref=lm32] that any pi must be of the form 2ai  ·  3bi - 1, where ai  ≤  2 and bi are positive integers. Hence [formula].

Thus we obtain

[formula]

As in the proof of the previous lemma, substituting the inequality

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Since k  ≥  46 by [\cite=SS], we have

[formula]

Multiplying ([\ref=eq43]) and ([\ref=eq44]), we obtain

[formula]

which is contradiction.

It immediately follows from these two lemmas that q  ≠  3.

The remaining part

The remaining case is the case [formula], i.e., q  ≠  3.

Suppose pi is not a Mersenne prime. Then peii has the form 2ai  ·  qbi - 1 with positive integers ai  ≤  2 and bi. Moreover, for any integer b, at most one of the pairs (1,b) and (2,b) appear in (ai,bi)'s.

The former part follows from Lemma [\ref=lm32]. Since q  ≠  3, 3 divides at least one of 2  ·  qb - 1 and 4  ·  qb - 1. If both pairs (ai,bi) = (1,b) and (aj,bj) = (2,b) appear, then at least one of peii and pejj must be a power of three, which violates the condition that pi and pj are not Mersenne.

q  ≤  13. Furthermore, provided f2  ≥  2, we have q = 5 or q = 7.

By Lemma [\ref=lm51], we have

[formula]

Since [formula], we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lm34], we have

[formula]

Combining these inequalities, we obtain

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

This yields q  ≤  13. If f2  ≥  2, then this inequality yields q  ≤  7.

q  ≠  5.

Suppose that q = 5. Then we have peii = 2  ·  5bi - 1 or peii = 4  ·  5bi - 1 or pi is Mersenne. Hence [formula]. We note that 9 = 32 and 49 = 72.

Let us assume that 19|N. Then [formula] and hence 33|N. By ([\ref=eq31]), we have

[formula]

Since f1  ≥  9, we have

[formula]

which is contradiction. Thus 19 cannot divide N. From this we deduce that if peii = 2  ·  5bi - 1 or peii = 4  ·  5bi - 1, then bi  ≥  3.

It is impossible that 7|N since 7 does not divide 2x + 1 or 5x + 1 for any integer x.

Hence, by Lemma [\ref=lm34] we have

[formula]

So that, we cannot have q = 5.

q  ≠  7,11,13.

Suppose q = 7. Observing that 4  ·  7b - 1 is divisible by 3, we deduce from Lemma [\ref=lm32] that, for any i, pi is a Mersenne prime or peii = 2  ·  7bi - 1. By Lemma [\ref=lm26], (2f1 + 1)(7f2 + 1) is not divisible by 7. Hence

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lm34], we have k  ≥  3. We deduce from Lemma [\ref=lm32] that we can take an integer s with 1  ≤  s  ≤  3 for which the following statement holds: there is at least 3 - s indices i such that pi is a Mersenne prime and ei is odd, and there is at least s indices i such that peii = 2  ·  7bi - 1. If s = 1, then f1  ≥  6 and f2  ≥  1. If s = 2, then f1  ≥  4 and f2  ≥  3. If s = 3, then f1  ≥  3 and f2  ≥  6.

[formula]

Combining two inequalities ([\ref=eq541]) and ([\ref=eq542]), we have

[formula]

which is contradiction.

Suppose q = 11. Observing that 2  ·  112b + 1 - 1 and 4  ·  112b - 1 is divisible by 3, we deduce from Lemma [\ref=lm32] that, for any i, pi is a Mersenne prime or peii = 2ai  ·  7bi - 1 with ai + bi odd.

[formula]

In a similar way to derive ([\ref=eq542]), we obtain

[formula]

Combining these inequalities, we have

[formula]

which is contradiction.

Suppose q = 13. 3|N and [formula] since [formula]. Hence f1 must be odd. Moreover, f2 = 1 by Lemma [\ref=lm52]. Hence σ*(N) = 2f1  ·  13 and N = 7(2f1 + 1). There is exactly one index j such that pejj is of the form 2a13b - 1 for some positive integers a,b. By Lemma [\ref=lm32], we have a  ≤  2. Moreover, we have b = 1 since b  ≤  f2 = 1. Hence pejj = 25 = 52. Since 13f2 + 1 = 2  ·  7, 2f1 + 1 must be divisible by 5. But this is impossible since f1 is odd.

Now Theorem [\ref=th11] is clear. By Lemma [\ref=lm52], q must be one of 3,5,7,11,13. In the previous section, it is shown that q  ≠  3. Theorem [\ref=th53] shows that q  ≠  5. Theorem [\ref=th54] eliminates the remaining possibilities.
