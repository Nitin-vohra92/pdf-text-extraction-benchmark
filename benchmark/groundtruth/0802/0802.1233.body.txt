Algebraic Degree of Polynomial Optimization

Introduction

Consider optimization problem

[formula]

where fi(x) are multivariate polynomial functions in [formula] (the ring of polynomials in [formula] with real coefficients). The recent interest on solving polynomial optimization problems [\cite=Las01] [\cite=NDS] [\cite=Par00] [\cite=ParStu] by using semidefinite relaxations or other algebraic methods motivates this study of the algebraic properties of the polynomial optimization problem ([\ref=POP]). A fundamental problem about ([\ref=POP]) is how the optimal solutions depend on the input polynomials fi(x). When the optimality condition holds and it has finitely many complex solutions, the optimal solutions are algebraic functions of the coefficients of polynomials fi(x), i.e., the coordinates of optimal solutions are roots of some univariate polynomials whose coefficients are functions of the input data. An interesting and important problem in optimization theory is to study the properties of these algebraic functions, e.g., how big their degrees are, i.e., what is the number of complex solutions to the critical equations of ([\ref=POP]). Let us begin discussions with some special cases.

The simplest case of ([\ref=POP]) is the linear programming (LP), i.e., all polynomials fi(x) have degree one. In this case, the problem ([\ref=POP]) has the form (after removing the linear equality constraints)

[formula]

where c,A,b are matrices or vectors of appropriate dimensions. The feasible set of ([\ref=LP]) is now a polytope described by some linear inequalities. As is well-known, one optimal solution x* (if it exists) of ([\ref=LP]) must occur at one vertex of the polytope. So x* can be determined by the linear system consisting of the active constraints. When the objective cTx is changing, the optimal solution might move from one vertex to another vertex. So the optimal solution is a piecewise linear fractional function of the input data (c,A,b). When c,A,b are all rational, an optimal solution must also be rational, and hence its algebraic degree is one.

A more general convex optimization which is a proper generalization of linear programming is semidefinite programming (SDP) which has the standard form

[formula]

where c is a constant vector and the Ai are constant symmetric matrices. The inequality [formula] means the matrix X is positive semidefinite. Recently, Nie et al. [\cite=NRS] studied the algebraic properties of semidefinite programming. When c and Ai are generic, the optimal solution x* of ([\ref=SDP]) is shown [\cite=NRS] to be a piecewise algebraic function of c and Ai. Of course, the constraint of ([\ref=SDP]) can be replaced by the nonnegativity of all the principle minors of the constraint matrix, and hence ([\ref=SDP]) becomes a special case of ([\ref=POP]). However, the problem ([\ref=SDP]) has very special nice properties, e.g., it is a convex program and the constraint matrix is linear with respect to x. Interestingly, if c and Ai are generic, the degree of each piece of this algebraic function only depends on the rank of the constraint matrix at the optimal solution. A formula for this degree is given in [\cite=NRS].

Another optimization problem frequently used in statistics and biology is the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), which has the standard form

[formula]

where Θ is an open subset of [formula], the pi(x) are polynomials such that [formula], and the ui are given positive integers. The optimizer x* is an algebraic function of [formula]. This problem has recently been studied and a formula for the degree of this algebraic function has been found (cf. [\cite=CHKS] [\cite=HKS]).

In this paper we consider the general optimization problem ([\ref=POP]), when the polynomials f0,f1,...,fm define a complete intersection, i.e., their common set of zeros has codimension m + 1. We show that an optimal solution is an algebraic function of the input data. We call the degree of this algebraic function the algebraic degree of the polynomial optimization problem ([\ref=POP]). Equivalently, the algebraic degree equals the number of complex solutions to the critical equations of ([\ref=POP]), when this is finite. Under some genericity assumptions, we give in this paper a formula for the algebraic degree of ([\ref=POP])

Throughout this paper, the words "generic" and "genericity" are frequently used. These words are given a precise meaning in algebraic geometry. Some property or condition holds "generically' means it holds in some Zariski open set (a set described by polynomial inequalities ≠  ). Any statement that is proved under such a genericity hypothesis will be valid for all data that lie in a dense, open subset of the space of data, and hence it will hold except on a set of Lebesgue measure zero.

The algebraic degree of polynomial optimization ([\ref=POP]) addresses the computational complexity at a fundamental level. To solve ([\ref=POP]) exactly essentially reduces to solving some univariate polynomial equations whose degrees are the algebraic degree of ([\ref=POP]). As we can see later, the algebraic degree might be very big.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 derives a general formula for the algebraic degree, and Section 3 gives the formulae of the algebraic degrees for special cases like quadratically constrained quadratic programming, second order cone programming, and p-th order cone programming.

A general formula for algebraic degree

In this section, we shall derive the formula for the algebraic degree of polynomial optimization problem ([\ref=POP]), when the polynomials define a complete intersection. Suppose the polynomial fi(x) has degree di. Let x* be one local or global optimal solution of ([\ref=POP]).

At first, we assume all the inequality constraints are active, i.e., me = m, and the coefficients of polynomials [formula] are generic. When m = n, by Bertini's Theorem [\cite=Ha], the feasible set of ([\ref=POP]) is finite and hence the algebraic degree is equal to the Bézout's number [formula]. So, without loss of generality, assume m < n. If the variety

[formula]

is smooth at x*, i.e., the gradient vectors

[formula]

are linearly independent, then the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition holds at x* (Chapter 12 in [\cite=NW]), i.e.,

[formula]

where [formula] are Lagrange multipliers for constraints [formula]. Thus the optimal solution x* and Lagrange multipliers [formula] are determined by the polynomial system ([\ref=KKT]). The set of points x* in solutions to ([\ref=KKT]) forms the locus of critical points of ([\ref=POP]). If the system ([\ref=KKT]) is zero-dimensional, then, by elimination theory [\cite=CLO], the coordinates of the points x* are algebraic functions of the coefficients of the polynomials fi. Each coordinate x*i can be determined by some univariate polynomial equation like

[formula]

where aj are rational functions of the coefficients of the fi. Interestingly, when f1,f2,...,fm are generic, the KKT condition always holds at any optimal solutions, and the degrees δi are equal to each other. This common degree counts the number of solutions to ([\ref=KKT]), i.e., the cardinality of the critical locus of ([\ref=POP]) or, by definition, the algebraic degree of the polynomial optimization ([\ref=POP]). We will derive a general formula for this degree.

In what follows, we work on the complex projective spaces, where the above question may be answered as a problem in intersection theory. For this we need to translate the optimization problem to a relevant intersection problem. Let [formula] be the n-dimensional complex projective space. A point [formula] is a class of vectors [formula] that are parallel to each other. A variety in [formula] is a set of points [formula] that satisfy a collection of homogeneous polynomial equations in [formula]. Let i()  =  xdi0fi(x / x0) be the homogenization of fi(x). Define U to be the projective variety in [formula] as

[formula]

Next, we let

[formula]

be the gradient vector, with respect to the homogeneous coordinates. Notice that [formula], so the homogenization of [formula] coincides with the last n coordinates in i.

In this homogeneous setting, the optimality condition for problem ([\ref=POP]) with m = me is

[formula]

where [formula] is the critical value. Let [formula] be a critical point, i.e., a solution to ([\ref=HOP]). We may eliminate μ by asking that the matrix

[formula]

have rank one, and the matrix

[formula]

have rank m + 1. The first condition and the condition [formula] mean that our critical points

[formula]

while the rank of the second matrix equals m + 1 at points where [formula] only if the submatrix

[formula]

has rank m. Therefore we define W to be the projective variety in [formula]:

[formula]

the locus of points where the rank of

[formula]

M·(λ,...,λ)=0,

[formula]

Some special cases

In this section we derive the algebraic degree of some special polynomial optimization problems. The simplest special case is that all the polynomials fi in ([\ref=POP]) have degree one, i.e., ([\ref=POP]) becomes one linear programming of the form ([\ref=LP]). If the objective c is generic, precisely n constraints will be active. So the algebraic degree is [formula]. This is consistent with we have observed in Introduction. Now let us look at other special cases.

=1 Unconstrained optimization

We consider the special case that the problem ([\ref=POP]) has no constraints. It becomes an unconstrained optimization. Its optimal solutions makes the gradient of the objective vanish. By Theorem [\ref=algdeg], the algebraic degree is bounded by Dn(d0 - 1) = (d0 - 1)n, which is exactly the Bézout's number of the gradient polynomial system

[formula]

Since f0 can be chosen freely among all polynomials of degree d0, Remark [\ref=BAS] applies to show that the degree bound above is sharp.

=1 Quadratic constrained quadratic programming

Consider the special case that all the polynomials [formula] are quadratic. Then problem ([\ref=POP]) becomes one quadratic constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) which has the standard form

[formula]

Here Ai,bi,ci are matrices or vectors of appropriate dimensions. The objective and all the constraints are all quadratic polynomials. At one optimal solution, suppose [formula] constraints are active. By Corollary [\ref=cor:deg], the algebraic degree is bounded by

[formula]

The polynomials f0,f1,...,fm can be chosen freely in the space of quadratic polynomials, so Remark [\ref=BAS] applies to show that the degree bound above is sharp.

=1 Second order cone programming

The second order cone programming (SOCP) has the following standard form

[formula]

where c,ai,bi,Ci,di are matrices or vectors of appropriate dimensions. Let x* be one optimizer. Since SOCP is a convex program, the x* must also be a global solution. By removing the square root in the constraint, SOCP becomes the polynomial optimization

[formula]

Without loss of generality, assume that the constraints with indices [formula] are active at x*. The objective is linear but the constraints are all quadratic. As we can see, the Hessian of the constraints has the special form aiaTi  -  CTiCi. Let ri be the number of rows of Ci. When ri = 1, the constraint [formula] is equivalent to two linear constraints

[formula]

Thus, when every ri = 1, the problem reduces to a linear programming and hence has algebraic degree one, because in this situation the polynomial (aTix + bi)2  -  (Cix + di)2 is reducible. When ri  ≥  2 and ai,bi,Ci,di are generic, the polynomial (aTix + bi)2  -  (Cix + di)T(Cix + di) is quadratic of rank ri + 1 and hence irreducible. Without loss of generality, assume 1 = r1 = r2 = ... = rk < rk + 1  ≤  ...  ≤  rm. Then problem ([\ref=SOCP]) is reduced to

[formula]

where scalar σi is chosen such that aTix*  +  bi  +  σi(Cix*  +  di) = 0. By Corollary [\ref=cor:deg], the algebraic degree of SOCP in this modified form is bounded by

[formula]

When k = m, we have already seen the algebraic degree is one.

For the sharpness of degree bound ([\ref=eq:socpdeg]), we apply Bertini's Theorem following Remark [\ref=BAS]. For every [formula], define the set Ui of polynomials as

[formula]

Then define affine spaces Vi as follows:

[formula]

Then every set Ui intersects any Zariski open subset of the affine space Vi. On the other hand the set of common zeros of the linear polynomials

[formula]

and all the polynomials in the union [formula] is contained in the set

[formula]

Therefore, for generic choices ai,bi,Ci,di, if [formula], the set Z is empty. Hence Remark [\ref=BAS] applies to show that, for generic choices of c,ai,bi,Ci,di, if [formula], the algebraic degree bound [formula] is sharp.

=1 p-th order cone programming

The p-th order cone programming (pOCP) has the standard form

[formula]

where c,ai,bi,Ci,di are matrices or vectors of appropriate dimensions. This is also a convex optimization problem. Let x* be one optimizer, and assume the constraints with indices [formula] are active at x*. Suppose the matrices Ci has ri rows. When some ri = 1, the constraint [formula] is equivalent to two linear constraints

[formula]

Like the SOCP case, assume [formula]. Then problem ([\ref=pOCP]) is equivalent to

[formula]

where σi is chosen such that aTix*  +  bi  +  σi(Cix*  +  di) = 0. In this situation

[formula]

By Corollary [\ref=cor:deg], the algebraic degree of x* is therefore bounded by

[formula]

When k = m, problem ([\ref=pOCP]) is reducible to some linear programming and hence its algebraic degree is one.

Now we discuss the sharpness of degree bound ([\ref=eq:pdeg]). Similarly to the SOCP case, for every [formula], define the set of polynomials Ui as

[formula]

Then define affine spaces Vi as follows:

[formula]

Then every set Ui intersects any Zariski open subset of the affine space Vi. On the other hand, the set of common zeros of the linear polynomials

[formula]

and all the polynomials in the union [formula] is contained in the set Z defined by ([\ref=eq:Zdef]). Therefore, for generic choices of ai,bi,Ci,di, if [formula], the set Z is empty, and hence Remark [\ref=BAS] implies that the degree bound given by formula ([\ref=eq:pdeg]) is sharp.
