Damping by slow relaxing rare earth impurities in Ni80Fe20

The dynamic response of magnetic materials is of fundamental interest as well as essential for various applications in modern magnetic storage technology. Often it is desirable to tailor the damping parameter and the resonance frequency of magnetic materials independently. While the resonance frequency can be controlled relatively easily by e.g. controlling the saturation magnetization it is more difficult to change the Gilbert damping parameter in a controlled way. Recent experiments have demonstrated the ability to modify the damping parameter of transition metals and transition metal alloys by introducing rare earth (RE) impurities [\cite=Bailey-IEEE01] [\cite=Reidy-APL03] or 3d- and 5d transition metals [\cite=Rantschler-JAP06]. Unfortunately a convincing microscopic understanding of the origin of RE-induced damping in metallic alloys is still missing.

Here, we present experimental results on the magnetization dynamics of thin Ni80Fe20 films doped with the lanthanides Gd, Tb, Dy, and Ho. By varying the dopant concentration we were able to tune the damping parameter by two orders of magnitude. The dynamic response was measured over a wide frequency range (0.5-35 GHz). By employing various resonance techniques and configurations extrinsic and intrinsic relaxation effects are separated. This procedure allows us to precisely determine the induced damping for the various rare earth dopants and, more importantly, to unambiguously identify the physical origin if the effect. We find that the slow relaxation of the 4f electron spins of the rare earth atoms is responsible for the induced damping. As this mechanism should also lead to a very strong temperature dependence of the relaxation we perform temperature dependent FMR measurements to test the applicability of the slow relaxer model.

A series of 10 and 30 nm thick RE doped Ni80Fe20 films was grown by DC magnetron co-sputtering from single element targets. A 1 nm thick Ta seed layer was first deposited onto the glass substrates. The RE doped Ni80Fe20 films were capped with a 3 nm thick Ta layer to prevent oxidation. During deposition an Ar gas pressure of 2  ×  10- 3 mbar was used and the deposition rate was about 0.1 nm/s. The film thicknesses of all samples were measured by x-ray reflectivity, and the RE concentration was determined by Rutherford Back Scattering; the uncertainty of this method is below 1 at. %. The static properties of the samples where investigated by vibrating sample magnetometry and magneto optic Kerr effect measurements. In Ni80Fe20-RE earth intermetallic alloys the 4f magnetic moments of the RE atoms are coupled to the 3d of the Ni80Fe20 moments via the intra-atomic 5d orbitals [\cite=Campbell] [\cite=Coey]. The resulting effective 5d-3d exchange coupling is antiferromagnetic (AF) leading to an antiparallel alignment of RE 4f moments and the Ni80Fe20 3d moments [\cite=Campbell] [\cite=Coey]. This ferrimagnetic order leads to a decreasing saturation magnetization with increasing RE content. In our samples we observe a linear decrease of the saturation magnetization as a function of doping for all RE elements with a slope of about 40 Oe per atomic percent of RE doping at room temperature (RT). All samples have soft magnetic properties with small coercive fields (less than 2 Oe) and small uniaxial anisotropy fields (less than 5 Oe). From a structural point of view all samples discussed in this letter exhibit a polycrystalline fcc structure typical for low RE concentrations (below 8%) used here [\cite=Bailey-IEEE01]. However clustering of the RE atoms does not occur even in the amorphous phase at much higher RE concentrations [\cite=Robinson].

In ferromagnetic resonance measurements the linewidth ΔH(f) is proportional to the microwave frequency f only for Gilbert damping. Two magnon scattering due to defects and the superposition of local resonance lines due to large scale magnetic inhomogeneities lead to a zero frequency linewidth ΔH(0) [\cite=Heinrich-JAP85] [\cite=McMichael-PRL03]. If Gilbert damping dominates one has ΔH(0)  ≪  ΔH and the linewidth at a given frequency can be converted into the damping parameter using α  =  ΔHγ  /  ω. The series of FMR lines shown in Fig. [\ref=dh-ho] was measured at a frequency of 22 GHz using Ho-concentrations of 0 - 6 %. This data illustrates the broadening of the FMR linewidth as a function of the rare earth concentration. The pure Ni80Fe20 film exhibits a linewidth of approximately 50 Oe whereas ΔH increases by a factor of 20 to 940 Oe for a doping concentration of 6 % Ho.

The observed linewidth broadening can generally have various origins. In order to be able to distinguish contributions from (i) Gilbert damping, (ii) two magnon scattering and (iii) sample inhomogeneity we perform FMR measurements over a wide frequency range allowing us to estimate ΔH(0) and thus to verify whether significant extrinsic contributions are present. Out-of-plane FMR measurements further allow one to separate magnetic inhomogeneity (local resonance) and two magnon scattering contributions [\cite=Arias-PRB99] [\cite=McMichael-PRL03], as for inhomogeneous samples one expects a line broadening in the perpendicular configuration compared to the parallel configuration ([formula]) [\cite=bland-Spinger05]. For all samples discussed in this manuscript the out of plane angular dependence of ΔH (not shown) is consistent with Gilbert damping and we observe [formula].

Fig. 2 shows the FMR linewidth as a function of frequency for various concentrations of Gd, Tb, Dy, and Ho. The linewidth strongly increases with increasing Tb, Dy, and Ho doping concentration, while almost no effect is observed for Gd doping (note the 10  ×   reduced scale for Gd doping). For all films at doping levels of 6 % and below the linewidth at zero frequency ΔH(0) is very small compared to the total linewidth at 22 GHz and can be neglected. We conclude that for doping concentrations up to 6 % for all RE dopants the parameter α can be easily determined from the slope of the frequency dependent linewidth. The results are summarized in Fig. [\ref=alph]. For Gd doping of 5 % the damping constant of the Ni80Fe20 film is not considerably influenced. On the other hand Ho, Tb and Dy doped Ni80Fe20 films show a very strong dependence of the damping parameter on the dopant concentration. With increasing RE concentration the damping parameter α increases linearly. From the slope of the linear increase we determine the contribution to the damping parameter per concentration of RE dopant, i.e. α  =  αNiFe  +  ΔαRECRE, where CRE is the RE atomic concentration in percent. The values for ΔαRE are 0.0005, 0.038, 0.036, 0.017 for Gd, Tb, Dy, and Ho. We observe that ΔαRE for Tb and Dy doping are similar and lead to the largest damping, while the value for Ho is only about half that of Tb and Dy. For Gd doping the contribution is very small and only a consequence of the reduced magnetization. This is a striking observation considering that earlier experimental [\cite=Reidy-APL03] and theoretical [\cite=Rebei-PRL03] studies suggested RE induced damping to be proportional to the orbital moment of the dopants. Based on these predictions one should observe the largest effect for Ho (L=6) doping, a smaller effect for Dy (L=5) and Tb (L=3), and no effect for Gd (L=0). This behavior is not observed in our detailed measurements. In Fig. [\ref=irkin] the contributed damping parameter ΔαRE is plotted as a function of the orbital moment of the dopants. Clearly the contributed damping is not proportional to the orbital moment of the dopants.

In the 1960s Orbach and van Vleck [\cite=vanVleck-PRL63] introduced the 'slow relaxing' (SR) impurity model to describe the damping in RE-doped Yttrium Iron Garnets (YIG)[\cite=Seiden-PR63]. The essence of the slow relaxer model is the following: the 4f multiplet of the RE is split in the moderate exchange field of the 5d electrons. This Zeeman splitting is of the order of 10 meV and the levels are hence thermally populated at RT. In The anisotropy of the 4f-5d exchange interaction causes a modulation of the 4f exchange splitting when the 3d moments precess. The thermal population of the 4f levels follows this temporal modulation, but is delayed by the RE relaxation time τRE. Thermal transitions in the 4f multiplet lead to a locally fluctuating transverse field h(t) acting on the 3d moments via the strong 3d-5d coupling if the 4f-5d exchange interaction is anisotropic. Using the second fluctuation dissipation theorem one can show that the damping constant is given by the Fourier transform of the time correlation of h(t) [\cite=mori]. The time correlation function of the fluctuation field can be approximated by 〈h(t)h(0)〉 = h2 exp  -  t  /  τ leading to the following expression for the Gilbert damping parameter:

[formula]

where the constant C is given by [formula] and the temperature dependent function F(T) accounts for the fact that the precession induced repopulation of the 4f levels strongly depends on the temperature [\cite=Sparks-JAP67]. MS is the saturation magnetization, CRE is the concentration of the RE ions, and A is the anisotropy of the 5d-4f exchange interaction and given by the angular derivatives of the 5d-4f exchange energy Ω [\cite=Sparks-JAP67]. Its magnitude can be estimated from the anisotropy contribution arising from the anisotropic exchange interaction between the 4f moments and the conduction electrons as observed in metallic rare earth single crystals Kex [\cite=Irhkin88]. For a two level system one has [formula] [\cite=Sparks-JAP67]. The population of the 4f levels in RE doped YIG is indeed well described as a two level system due to the large crystal field spitting. In experiments both ΔHRE and SRE have shown a strong temperature dependence with a peak occurring at low T when Ω = kBT [\cite=Seiden-PR63] [\cite=Sparks-JAP67] [\cite=Clarke-PR65]. The two level approximation, however, may not be justified for RE doped Ni80Fe20. Due to the absence of a significant crystal field in the metallic alloy 2J+1 4f levels need to be considered allowing transitions to occur at 2J different energies. Therefore considerable broadening of the linewidth peak at low temperature (compared to RE doped YIG) is expected for RE doped Ni80Fe20.

The real part of Eq.[\ref=emori] corresponds to damping and causes a linewidth [formula] while the imaginary part leads to a negative field shift [formula]. Provided that ω  ≪  1 / τRE the damping is independent of the frequency and the resonance field shift is small. The negative field shift is a consequence of the time delayed damping torque (due to thermal repopulation of the 4f levels) leading to an effective longitudinal field. In order to predict the relative strength of this effect at a given temperature as a function of the RE element one only needs to compare the calculated relative magnitude of the anisotropic exchange contribution to the magnetic anisotropy [\cite=Irhkin88] as shown in fig.[\ref=irkin]. One finds: KexGd = 0, KexTb = 5.5  ×  108 erg/cm3, KexDy = 4.6  ×  108 erg/cm3, and KexHo = 1.43  ×  108 erg/cm3 [\cite=Irhkin88]. Neglecting the temperature dependence in Eq. [\ref=emori] (it should be roughly the same for the various RE elements) one immediately observes that the RE induced relaxation should be significantly smaller for Ho dopants compared to Tb and Dy. It is also apparent from this analysis why doping with Gd with its isotropic 4f-5d exchange interaction (S-state) cannot lead to additional relaxation.

The applicability of the SR model for RE doped Ni80Fe20 can be further tested by verifying whether ΔHRE and SRE increase with decreasing temperature as predicted by Eq.[\ref=emori]. Fig. [\ref=temp]a shows the temperature dependence ΔHRE and SRE measured at f=10 GHz for Ni80Fe20, Ni80Fe20:Gd5, Ni80Fe20:Tb2, Ni80Fe20:Dy2.5, and Ni80Fe20:Ho2. Indeed for Tb, Dy, and Ho, the data can be well described by Eq. [\ref=emori]. The expected negative field shift of the resonance field is clearly observed, see Fig. [\ref=temp]. The temperature dependence of ΔHRE and SRE is expected to be similar since it is primarily caused by F(T) and τRE(T). Using Eq. [\ref=emori] the RE relaxation time τRE can be estimated from the ratio 2|SRE| / ΔHRE  =  ωτRE. From the data shown in Fig. [\ref=temp] for SRE and ΔHRE one can estimate at room temperature τ300 KRE  ~  1 ps and at low temperature τ120 KRE  ~  3 - 10 ps for Tb, Dy and Ho doping. This is in excellent agreement with earlier independent measurements [\cite=Clarke-PR65] for τRE observed in RE doped YIG as can be seen in the inset of Fig.[\ref=temp]. The shorter τ300 KRE causes the field shift to be rather small at RT, cf. Fig.[\ref=dh-ho]. As ωτRE  ≪  1 for all our measurements Eq. [\ref=emori] predicts a linear frequency dependence of the FMR linewidth in agreement with the experimental results shown in Fig. [\ref=dh].

In addition to the temperature dependence also the magnitude of the RE induced linewidth is similar for YIG and Ni80Fe20 if one considers the ratio of RE concentration to the magnetization. By scaling the YIG results from Dillon [\cite=Dillon-PR62] one expects for a doping level of 2% at room temperature a linewidth of a few hundred Oe at 10 GHz for RE=Tb and Dy in agreement with the present results; see Fig. [\ref=temp]. It is therefore compelling to conclude that the additional damping due to RE doping in Ni80Fe20 is caused by the very same slow relaxing impurity mechanism which was originally proposed for RE doped YIG.

Our experimental results sharply contradict earlier experimental [\cite=Reidy-APL03] and theoretical work [\cite=Rebei-PRL03]. Reidy et al. [\cite=Reidy-APL03] performed dynamic measurements using only pulsed inductive magnetometry at very low frequencies (~  500 MHz). In addition these measurements suffer from a large uncertainty with respect to the RE content of the samples. The corresponding data points are included in Fig. [\ref=irkin]. The absolute values for the damping constants derived from those measurements are up to a factor of 5 lower than our present results. However, we would like to point out that our present results are in excellent agreement with earlier measurements for Tb doped Ni80Fe20 films deposited under similar conditions as the films used in the present study [\cite=Bailey-IEEE01] [\cite=Russek-JAP02] (see Fig. [\ref=irkin]). Bailey et al. found a strong dependence of the contributed damping on the Ar-pressure during the film deposition [\cite=Bailey-IEEE01], with larger damping observed in films deposited at lower sputter gas pressures. Lower sputter gas pressures and lower deposition rates typically lead to smoother, more homogeneous films with larger grain sizes. Note, that the films used in the present study were deposited at even lower sputter gas pressures and deposition rates than the ones in [\cite=Bailey-IEEE01]. The theoretical work by Rebei and Hohlfeld [\cite=Rebei-PRL03] is based on orbit-orbit coupling effects between RE impurities and itinerant electrons but does not consider the slow relaxing impurity model. Rebei et al. solely justify the usage of itinerant electrons on the basis of better agreement with the experimental data by Reidy et al. [\cite=Reidy-APL03]. However, their theory results in temperature independent Gilbert damping without a negative field shift and strictly proportional to the orbital moment of the RE impurities. These predictions are clearly at variance with our experimental results. On the other hand the present results (temperature, frequency, and element dependence of the RE induced damping) can be readily explained by the slow relaxing impurity model.
