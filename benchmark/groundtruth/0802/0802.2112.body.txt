On the Security of "an efficient and complete remote user authentication scheme"

Introduction

Remote system authentication is a process by which a remote system gains confidence about the identity (or login request) of the communicating partner. Since the Lamport's scheme [\cite=lam81], several remote user authentication schemes and improvements have been proposed with and without smart cards. Recently, Liaw et al. [\cite=lia06] proposed a remote user authentication scheme using smart cards. Their scheme has claimed a number of features e.g. mutual authentication, no clock synchronization, no verifier table, flexible user password change, etc. We show that Liaw et al.'s scheme is completely insecure. Any unregistered user can easily login to the remote system and establish a session key.

The Liaw et al.'s scheme

The scheme consists of five phases: registration, login, verification, session and password change. Registration phase: A new user Ui submits identity IDi and password PWi to the remote system for registration. The remote system computes Ui's secret information vi  =  h(IDi,x) and [formula], where x is a secret key maintained by the remote system and h(  ·  ) is a secure one-way hash function. Then the remote system writes h(  ·  ) and ei into the memory of a smart card and issues the card to Ui. Login phase: When Ui wants to log into the remote system, he/she inserts the smart card into the terminal and enters IDi and PWi. The smart card then performs the following operations:

Verification phase: To check the authenticity of <  IDi,Ci,Ni  >  , the remote system checks the validity of IDi. If IDi is valid, computes [formula] and checks whether [formula]. Then generates a random nonce Ns, encrypts the message [formula] and sends it back to the card. The smart card decrypts the message [formula] and gets [formula]. Then verifies whether [formula] and [formula]. If these checks hold valid, the mutual authentication is done. Session phase: This phase involves two public parameters q and α where q is a large prime number and α is a primitive element mod q. The phase works as follows:

Password change phase: With this phase Ui can change his/her PWi by the following steps:

Security Weaknesses

Weakness of Authentication phase: The authentication phase suffers from the replay attacks. The authenticity of the login request is not checked at all. The adversary A (or any unregistered user) intercepts a valid login request, say <  IDi,Ci,Ni  >  . Later A sends <  IDi,Ci,Ni  >   to the remote system, as a login request . To validate <  IDi,Ci,Ni  >  , the remote system does the following: Weakness of Session phase: Although Liaw et al.'s scheme used Diffie-Hellman [\cite=dif76] key exchange protocol for session key establishment; however, they did not consider the risk of Diffie-Hellman's protocol (i.e., man-in-the-middle attack) while establishing the user and server common session key. Let us examine the weakness of the session phase. In fact, all the parameters Ni,Si,Wi,α,q are public, thereby any one can compute the session key. Once the session key is established then the remote system and A exchange data in an encrypted manner, where ei acts as the encryption key. Firstly, the remote system does not know ei. Secondly, the session key never serve the purpose of the transaction privacy, instead it is just xor-ed with the message and ei is used for transaction privacy, which is not the actual scenario in the practical applications. Weakness of Password change phase: There is no verification of the entered password. This effectively makes the smart card useless. Suppose Ui enters his password which is actually misspelled or incorrect, that is, instead of PWi he/she enters PW. However, the smart card takes the wrong password PW and asks for a new password. Now, Ui enters new password [formula]. The smart card updates old ei by the new [formula] where [formula]. In the next login time, Ui cannot login to the remote system, because the verification of Ci fails. In another scenario, if Ui's smart card is lost or stolen, then the party who got the smart card, would try to login and enters some random password, which leads to block the card, as there is no provision of checking the entered password.

Conclusion

We have shown the security weaknesses of the Liaw et al.'s scheme. The design of the Liaw et al.'s scheme is so weak that any one can login to the remote system by just intercepting a valid login message.
