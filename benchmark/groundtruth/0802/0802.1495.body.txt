A characterisation of the [formula] lattice and definite nonunimodular intersection forms

Introduction

The intersection pairing of a smooth compact four-manifold, possibly with boundary, is an integral symmetric bilinear form QX on [formula]; it is nondegenerate if the boundary of X has first Betti number zero. Characteristic covectors for QX are elements of [formula] represented by the first Chern classes of structures. In the case that QX is positive-definite there are inequalities due to Frøyshov  (using Seiberg-Witten theory, see [\cite=f]) and Ozsváth  and Szabó  which give lower bounds on the square of a characteristic covector. It is helpful in this context to prove existence of characteristic covectors with small square. The following is the main result of this paper.

For unimodular forms this theorem was proved by Elkies [\cite=elkies]. To prove Theorem [\ref=thm:mainthm] we reinterpret the statement in terms of integral lattices. In Section [\ref=sec:lattice] we introduce the necessary notions and then study short characteristic covectors of some special types of lattices. The proof of the theorem is presented in Section [\ref=sec:proof]. The main idea is to use the theory of linking pairings to embed four copies of the lattice into a unimodular lattice and then apply Elkies' theorem along with results of Section [\ref=sec:lattice].

For unimodular forms, a well-known and useful constraint on the square of a characteristic vector is that ξ2 is congruent modulo 8 to the signature of the form. In Section [\ref=sec:congruence] we give a generalisation of this to nonunimodular forms.

In Section [\ref=sec:app] we combine Theorem [\ref=thm:mainthm] with an inequality of Ozsváth  and Szabó  [\cite=os4] to obtain the following theorem, where [formula] denotes the correction term invariant defined in [\cite=os4] for a structure [formula] on a rational homology three-sphere Y:

As an application we consider manifolds obtained as integer surgeries on knots. Knowing which positive surgeries on a knot bound negative-definite manifolds has implications for existence of fillable contact structures and for the unknotting number of the knot (see e.g. [\cite=ls] [\cite=bsinprep]). In particular we consider torus knots; it is well known that (pq - 1)-surgery on the torus knot Tp,q is a lens space. It follows that all large (≥  pq - 1) surgeries on torus knots bound both positive- and negative-definite four-manifolds (see e.g. [\cite=bsinprep]). We show in Section [\ref=sec:torus-knots] that small positive surgeries on torus knots cannot bound negative-definite four-manifolds. In particular, we obtain the following result; for a more precise statement see Corollary [\ref=cor:torus-neg-def].

Short characteristic covectors in special cases

An integral lattice L of rank n is the free abelian group [formula] along with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form [formula]. Let V denote the tensor product of L with [formula]; thus V is the vector space [formula] to which the form Q extends, and L is a sublattice of V. The signature σ(L) of the lattice L is the signature of Q. We say L is definite if |σ(L)| = n. For convenience denote Q(x,y) by x  ·  y and Q(y,y) by y2. A set of generators [formula] for L forms a basis of V satisfying [formula]. With respect to such a basis the form Q is represented by the matrix ni,j = 1. The determinant (or discriminant) of L is the determinant of the form (or the corresponding matrix).

The dual lattice [formula] consists of all vectors x∈V satisfying [formula] for all y∈L. A characteristic covector for L is an element ξ∈L' with [formula] for all y∈L.

We say a lattice is complex if it admits an automorphism [formula] with [formula] given by multiplication by - 1. A lattice is quaternionic if it admits an action of the quaternionic group [formula], with - 1 acting by multiplication. Note that the rank of a complex lattice is even, and the rank of a quaternionic lattice is divisible by 4. For any lattice L, let Lm denote the direct sum of m copies of L. There is a standard way to make [formula] into a complex lattice and L4 into a quaternionic lattice; for example, the quaternionic structure is given by

[formula]

Let [formula] denote the rank one lattice with determinant δ; in particular [formula].

Let [formula], and let p be a prime. Let L be an index p sublattice of [formula]. Then L has a characteristic covector ξ with ξ2  <  n - 1 unless [formula].

We may assume L contains none of the summands of [formula]; any such summand of L contributes 1 to the right-hand side of the inequality and at most 1 to the left-hand side.

If n = 1 then clearly [formula]. Now suppose n > 1. Let [formula] be a basis for [formula], where [formula] have square 1 and f2  =  δ. Then multiples of e give coset representatives of L in [formula]; it follows that a basis for L is given by [formula]. Here si,t are nonzero residues modulo p in

[formula]

Q=(),

[formula]

Q=().

[formula]

ξ=<n-1,

[formula]

Q=() =pδ() pδ I,

[formula]

. The matrix in this basis is

[formula]

with inverse

[formula]

If p = 2 then Q is even, and ξ = 0 is characteristic.

Suppose now that p is odd. Then [formula] is characteristic if k is odd and each li is even. By completing squares we have that

[formula]

It clearly suffices to prove the statement for δ = 1 and n = 2; thus the following sublemma completes the proof.

Let [formula], and let

[formula]

Note that [formula] (since [formula]).

If there exists [formula] then with this choice of k we find

[formula]

Otherwise let Kij denote [formula]. Then

[formula]

from which it follows that [formula]. Thus there exists some k∈Kij with [formula]. With this k we find

[formula]

Let [formula] be odd, and let q be a prime with [formula]. Let N be an index q2 quaternionic sublattice of [formula], with the quotient group [formula] having exponent q. Then N has a characteristic covector ξ with ξ2  <  4n - 4 unless [formula].

We may assume N contains none of the summands of [formula]. Suppose first that n = 1. Let [formula] be a basis for [formula] with e2  =  δ. Note that e and [formula] represent generators of the quotient [formula] otherwise we have [formula] for some s, and multiplication by [formula] yields [formula], but - 1 is not a quadratic residue modulo q. Now a basis for N is given by [formula]. The quaternionic symmetry yields

[formula]

it follows that the bilinear form Q on N factors as qδ times a unimodular form. Thus [formula].

We now assume n = 2 and δ = 1 (the proof for any other n,δ follows from this case). Let [formula] be a basis of unit vectors for [formula]. Then [formula] is a basis for N. In this case the quaternionic symmetry yields

[formula]

for i = 1,3,5, and at most one of [formula] is divisible by q. We may choose si,ti in

[formula]

ξ=(k+k+(ks+kt-lq)).

[formula]

. Then there exist k1,k2 odd and li even for which F < 4q2. Set k2 = 1. Let [formula], and let

[formula]

Note that [formula] (in fact Ki either contains [formula] or [formula] elements, depending on the value of ti).

If there is a k which is in the intersection of 4 of the Ki's, then setting k1 = k we obtain

[formula]

Otherwise let Kijk denote the triple intersection of Ki,Kj,Kk, and let Kij' denote [formula]. Then

[formula]

from which it follows that

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Thus there exists some k∈Kijk with [formula]. Setting k1 = k again yields

[formula]

First choose k2 (and l6) with [formula]. Again let [formula], and for each [formula] let

[formula]

then [formula].

If there is a k which is in the intersection of 4 of the Ki's, then setting k1 = k we obtain

[formula]

Otherwise (with notation as above) we have

[formula]

from which it follows that

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Thus there exists some k∈Kijk with [formula]. Setting k1 = k yields

[formula]

Proof of the main theorem

The bilinear form Q on L induces a symmetric bilinear [formula]-valued pairing on the finite group L' / L, called the linking pairing associated to L. Such pairings λ on a finite group G were studied by Wall [\cite=wall] (see also [\cite=kk]). He observed that λ splits into an orthogonal sum of pairings λp on the p-subgroups Gp of G. For any prime p let Apk (resp. Bpk) denote the pairings on [formula] with pk times the square of a generator a quadratic residue (resp. nonresidue) modulo p. If p is odd then λp decomposes into an orthogonal direct sum of these two types of pairings on cyclic subgroups. The pairing on G2 may be decomposed into cyclic summands (there are four equivalence classes of pairings on [formula] for k  ≥  3), plus two types of pairings on [formula]; these are denoted E2k,F2k. For an appropriate choice of generators, in E2k each cyclic generator has square 0, while in F2k they each have square 21 - k.

Let L be a lattice of rank n. Then L4 may be embedded as a quaternionic sublattice of a unimodular quaternionic lattice U of rank 4n.

Consider an orthogonal decomposition of the linking pairing on L' / L as described above. Let x∈L' represent a generator of a cyclic summand [formula] with k > 1. Then v = pk - 1x has [formula] and pv∈L. Adjoining v to L yields a lattice L1 which contains L as an index p sublattice (so that det L = p2 det L1). Similarly, if x∈L' represents a generator of a cyclic summand of E2k or F2k then v = 2k - 1x may be adjoined. Finally if x1,x2 represent generators of two [formula] summands then x1 + x2 may be adjoined. In this way we get a sequence of embeddings

[formula]

where each Li is an index p sublattice of Li + 1 for some prime p. Moreover the linking pairing of Lm1 decomposes into cyclic summands of prime order, and the determinant of Lm1 is either odd or twice an odd number.

Now let [formula]. Note that M0 is a complex sublattice of [formula]. Let p be a prime which is either 2 or is congruent to 1 modulo 4, so that there exists an integer a with [formula]. Let x∈L' represent a generator of a [formula] summand of the linking pairing of Lm1. Then [formula] has [formula] and pv∈M0. Adjoining v to M0 yields a lattice M1; since [formula], M1 is preserved by [formula]. Continuing in this way we obtain a sequence of embeddings

[formula]

where each Mi is an index p sublattice of Mi + 1 for some prime p with p = 2 or [formula]. Each Mi is a complex sublattice of [formula]. We may arrange that each Mi with i > 0 has odd determinant. The resulting linking pairing of Mm2 is the orthogonal sum of pairings on cyclic groups of prime order congruent to 3 modulo 4, and all the summands appear twice.

Finally let [formula]. This is a quaternionic sublattice of (L')4. Let [formula] be a prime, and suppose that x∈L' generates a [formula] summand of the linking pairing of Mm2. There exist integers a,b with [formula] (take m to be the smallest positive quadratic nonresidue and choose a,b so that [formula]). Let v1 = (x,0,ax,bx) and let [formula]. Then [formula], and qvi∈N0. Adjoining v1,v2 to N0 yields a quaternionic sublattice N1 of (L')4; note that [formula]. We thus obtain a sequence

[formula]

where each Ni is an index q2 sublattice of Ni + 1 for some prime [formula], Ni + 1 / Ni has exponent q, each Ni is quaternionic with odd determinant, and U is unimodular.

Using the methods of Proposition [\ref=prop:embed] one may show that L2 embeds in a unimodular lattice if and only if the prime factors of det L congruent to 3 mod 4 have even exponents. Applying this to rank 1 lattices one recovers the classical fact that any integer is expressible as the sum of 4 squares, and is the sum of 2 squares if and only if its prime factors congruent to 3 mod 4 have even exponents.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:mainthm]. Let L be the lattice with form Q. Embed L4 in a unimodular lattice U of rank 4n as in Proposition [\ref=prop:embed]. By Elkies' theorem [\cite=elkies] either [formula] or U has a characteristic covector ξ with ξ2  ≤  4n - 8. In the latter case, restricting to one of the four copies of L yields a covector ξ|L with (ξ|L)2  ≤  n - 2, which easily satisfies the statement of the theorem.

This leaves the case that [formula]. Let [formula] be as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:embed]. By successive application of Lemma [\ref=lem:qglue], we see that either [formula] for some [formula], or N0 has a characteristic covector ξ with ξ2 < 4n - 4. In the latter case, restricting ξ to one of the four copies of L yields (ξ|L)2 < n - 1.

If [formula] then [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:pglue] we find that either [formula] or M0 has a characteristic covector ξ with ξ2 < 2n - 2. In the latter case, restricting ξ to one of the two copies of L embedded in M0 yields (ξ|L)2 < n - 1.

Finally if [formula] then [formula]. Successive application of Lemma [\ref=lem:selfglue] now yields that either [formula] or L has a characteristic covector ξ with ξ2 < n - 1.

A congruence condition on characteristic covectors

Given a positive-definite symmetric bilinear form Q of rank n and determinant δ with [formula], one may ask for an optimal upper bound on the square of a shortest characteristic covector ξ. The square of a characteristic covector of a unimodular form is congruent to the signature modulo 8 (see for example [\cite=serre]). Thus if δ = 1 we have ξ2  ≤  n - 8. In this section we give congruence conditions on the square of characteristic covectors of forms of arbitrary determinant. Lattices in this section are not assumed to be definite. (The results in this section may be known to experts but we have not found them in the literature.)

If ξ1,ξ2 are characteristic covectors of a lattice L of determinant δ then their difference is divisible by 2 in L'; it follows that [formula] modulo [formula]. For a lattice with odd determinant the congruence holds modulo [formula]. We will give a formula for this congruence class in terms of the signature and linking pairing of L. For a lattice with determinant δ even or odd we will determine the congruence class of ξ2 modulo [formula] in terms of the signature and determinant.

Suppose [formula] where pi,qj are odd primes, not necessarily distinct. Let M be an even lattice of determinant δ with linking pairing isomorphic to [formula] Then the signature of M satisfies the congruence

[formula]

(For the definition of Apk and Bpk see the beginning of Section [\ref=sec:proof].)

Let G(M) denote the Gauss sum

[formula]

(See [\cite=taylor] for more details on Gauss sums and the Milgram Gauss sum formula.) Then G(M) depends only on the linking pairing of M and in fact factors as

[formula]

The factors are computed in [\cite=taylor] to be:

[formula]

(Note that in the notation of [\cite=taylor], Apk corresponds to (Cp(k);2) and Bql corresponds to (Cq(l);2nq), where nq is a quadratic nonresidue modulo q.)

The congruence on the signature of M now follows from the Milgram formula:

[formula]

Let L be a lattice of odd determinant δ with linking pairing isomorphic to [formula] Let ξ be a characteristic covector for L. Then

[formula]

Let M be an even lattice with the same linking pairing as L. (Existence of M is proved by Wall in [\cite=wall].) Then by [\cite=kp] L and M are stably equivalent; that is to say, there exist unimodular lattices U1,U2 such that [formula]. Let ξ be a characteristic covector for [formula]. Then we have decompositions

[formula]

Taking squares we find

[formula]

where the last line follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:evensig].

Let L be a lattice of determinant [formula], and let ξ be a characteristic covector for L. Then

[formula]

If δ is odd then Proposition [\ref=prop:mod8] shows that the congruence class of ξ2 modulo [formula] depends only on the signature and determinant; the formula then follows by taking L to be the lattice with the form [formula] where r + s = n - 1 and r - s = σ(L) - 1.

If δ is even then as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:embed] we find that either L or [formula] embeds as an index 2k sublattice of a lattice with odd determinant. It again follows that the congruence class of ξ2 modulo [formula] depends only on the signature and determinant.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:YboundsX]

We begin by noting the following restatement of Theorem [\ref=thm:mainthm] for negative-definite forms:

Let Q be an integral negative-definite symmetric bilinear form of rank n and determinant of absolute value δ. Then there exists a characteristic covector ξ for Q with

[formula]

moreover the inequality is strict unless [formula].

Let Y be a rational homology three-sphere and X a smooth negative-definite four-manifold bounded by Y, with b2(X) = n. For any [formula] structure [formula] on Y let [formula] denote the correction term invariant of Ozsváth  and Szabó  [\cite=os4]. It is shown in [\cite=os4] that for each [formula] structure [formula],

[formula]

The image of [formula] in [formula] is a characteristic covector for the intersection pairing QX on [formula]. Let δ denote the absolute value of the determinant of QX and [formula] the image of the restriction map from [formula] to [formula]. Then combining ([\ref=eqn:thm9.6]) with Theorem [\ref=thm:negdef] yields

[formula]

with strict inequality unless the intersection form of X is [formula].

Theorem [\ref=thm:YboundsX] follows immediately since if either δ is square-free or if there is no torsion in [formula], then the restriction map from [formula] to [formula] is surjective, and [formula].

Similar reasoning yields the following variant of Theorem [\ref=thm:YboundsX]:

Let Y be a rational homology sphere with [formula], with r square-free. If Y bounds a negative-definite four-manifold X, then

[formula]

Suppose Y and X are as in the statement of Theorem [\ref=thm:YboundsX] with δ even. If in fact

[formula]

then it is not difficult to see that this maximum must be attained at a spin structure.

Surgeries on L-space knots

Let K be a knot in the three-sphere and

[formula]

its Alexander polynomial. Torsion coefficients of K are defined by

[formula]

Note that ti(K) = 0 for i  ≥  NK, where NK denotes the degree of the Alexander polynomial of K. For any [formula] denote the n-surgery on K by Kn. K is called an L-space knot if for some n > 0, Kn is an L-space. Recall from [\cite=lenssurg] that a rational homology sphere is called an L-space if [formula] for each structure [formula] (so its Heegaard Floer homology groups resemble those of a lens space).

There are a number of conditions coming from Heegaard Floer homology that an L-space knot K has to satisfy. In particular (see [\cite=lenssurg]), its Alexander polynomial has the form

[formula]

From this it follows easily that the torsion coefficients ti(K) are given by

[formula]

where [formula] and n- j =  - nj, n0 = 0. In particular, ti(K) is nonincreasing in i for i  ≥  0.

The following formula for d-invariants of surgeries on such a knot is based on results in [\cite=Zsurg] and [\cite=lenssurg] (see also [\cite=Qsurg]). The proof was outlined to us by Peter Ozsváth.

Let K  ⊂  S3 be an L-space knot and let ti(K) denote its torsion coefficients. Then for any n > 0 the d-invariants of the ±  n surgery on K are given by

[formula]

for |i|  ≤  n / 2, where Un denotes the n surgery on the unknot U.

Before sketching a proof of the theorem we need to explain the notation. The d-invariants are usually associated to structures on the manifold. The set of structures on a three-manifold Y is parametrized by [formula]. In the case of interest we have [formula], hence structures can be labelled by the elements of [formula]. Such a labelling is assumed in the above theorem and described explicitly as follows. Attaching a 2-handle with framing n to S3  ×  [0,1] along K  ⊂  S3  ×  {1} gives a cobordism Wn from S3 to Kn. Note that [formula] is generated by the homology class of the core of the 2-handle attached to a Seifert surface for K; denote this generator by fn. A structure [formula] on Kn is labelled by i if it admits an extension [formula] to Wn satisfying

[formula]

If K = U is the unknot, the surgery is the lens space which bounds the disk bundle over S2 with Euler number n. Using either [\cite=os4] or [\cite=os6], the d-invariants of Un for n > 0 and |i| < n are given by

[formula]

According to [\cite=Zsurg] the Heegaard Floer homology groups HF+(Kn,i) for n  ≠  0 can be computed from the knot Floer homology of K. The knot complex C = CFK∞(S3,K) is a [formula]-filtered chain complex, which is a finitely generated free module over [formula]. We write (i,j) for the components of bidegree. Here U denotes a formal variable in degree - 2 that decreases the bidegree by (1,1). The homology of the complex C is HF∞(S3) = T, the homology of the quotient complex B+: = C{i  ≥  0} is [formula] and the homology of C{i = 0} is [formula]. The complexes C{j  ≥  0} and B+ are quasi-isomorphic and we fix a chain homotopy equivalence from C{j  ≥  0} to B+.

We now recall the description of HF+(K±  n) (n > 0) in the case of an L-space knot K. For [formula], let A+s denote the quotient complex [formula]. Let v+s:A+s  →  B+ denote the projection and h+s:A+s  →  B+ the chain map defined by first projecting to C{j  ≥  s}, then applying Us to identify with C{j  ≥  0} and finally applying the chain homotopy equivalence to B+. For any [formula] let [formula] and [formula], where B+s = B+ for all [formula]. Let [formula] be a homomorphism that on A+s acts by [formula]. Then HF+(K±  n,σ) is isomorphic to the direct sum of the kernel and the cokernel of the map that D+±  n induces between the homologies of [formula] and [formula] (which are direct sums of the homologies of A+s and B+s). Moreover, this isomorphism is a homogeneous map of degree ±  d(Un,σ), where [formula] is graded so that D+±  n has degree - 1. When computing for Kn, the grading on B+s, where s = σ + nk, is such that U0∈B+s has grading 2kσ + nk(k - 1) - 1. In case of - n-surgery U0∈B+σ + kn has grading - 2(k + 1)σ - nk(k + 1). (See [\cite=Zsurg] for more details.)

Suppose now that K is an L-space knot with Alexander polynomial as in ([\ref=eqn:L-knot-alex]). Define δk: = 0 and

[formula]

for [formula], where as above n- l =  - nl. Then by [\cite=lenssurg] C{i = 0} is (up to quasi-isomorphism) equal to the free abelian group with one generator xl in bidegree (0,nl) for [formula] and the grading of xl is δl. To determine the differentials note that the homology of C{i = 0} is [formula] in grading 0, so generated by (the homology class of) xk. It follows that the differential on C{i = 0} is a collection of isomorphisms C0,nk - 2l + 1  →  C0,nk - 2l for [formula]. Similarly we see that the differential on C{j = 0} is given by a collection of isomorphisms Cnk - 2l + 1,0  →  Cnk - 2l,0 for [formula]. This, together with U-equivariance, determines the complex C. (For an example, see Figure [\ref=fig:CFK].)

Suppose that the homology H of a quotient complex of C is isomorphic to [formula]. We say H starts at (i,j) if the element U0 has a representative of bidegree (i,j). With this notation H*(Bs) starts at (0,nk) and H*(C{j  ≥  s}) starts at (s,s + nk). It remains to consider H*(A+s). Note that these groups are also isomorphic to T+. For s  ≥  nk the homology of A+s starts at (0,nk), so v+s = id and h+s = Us. For nk - 1  ≤  s  <  nk, H*(A+s) starts at (s - nk,s), so v+s = Unk - s and h+s = Unk. For nk - 2  ≤  s < nk - 1 it starts at (nk - 1 - nk,nk - 1), hence v+s = Unk - nk - 1 and h+s = Unk - nk - 1 + s. It is now easy to observe that for s  ≥  0 the homology H*(A+s) starts at (ts,ts + nk) and thus v+s = Uts and h+s = Uts + s, where ts is a torsion coefficient of K (compare with equation ([\ref=eqn:L-knot-torsion])). Similarly for s < 0 we obtain v+s = Uts - s and h+s = Uts.

Note that since the structures corresponding to i and - i are conjugate (so their d invariants are equal) we may restrict to those in the range [formula]. Consider now Kn (n > 0) and choose some [formula]. Writing [formula] in components we obtain for l > 0:

[formula]

from which it is easily seen that D+n is surjective and its kernel contains one T+ summand, isomorphic to H*(Aσ). Since D+n shifts grading by - 1, U0∈H*(Bσ) has grading - 1, and the component of D+n from H*(Aσ) to H*(Bσ) is equal to Utσ, it follows that U0∈T+  ⊂   ker D+n has grading - 2tσ. The formula for d(Kn,σ) now follows using the degree shift between HF+(Kn,σ) and ker D+n.

Finally consider K- n (n > 0) and choose [formula]. Writing D+- n in components yields:

[formula]

The top and bottom equations determine as (or more precisely UNas for N >  > 0) for all [formula], so the middle equation cannot be fulfilled in general. It follows that D+- n has cokernel isomorphic to H*(Bσ - n) = T+; the grading of U0 in this group is 0. The formula for d(K- n,σ) again follows from the degree shift.

Combining Theorems [\ref=thm:YboundsX] and [\ref=thm:L-space-knot-d] yields

Let n > 0 and let K be an L-space knot whose torsion coefficients satisfy

[formula]

for 0  ≤  i  ≤  n / 2. Then for 0 < m  ≤  n, Km cannot bound a negative-definite four-manifold with no torsion in H1.

The formulas follow from the above-mentioned Theorems. To see that obstruction for n-surgery to bound a negative-definite manifold implies obstruction for all m-surgeries with 0 < m  ≤  n observe that for fixed i the right-hand side of the inequality is an increasing function of n for n  ≥  2i.

Note that the surgery coefficient m in Theorem [\ref=thm:L-space-knot-surgery] is an integer. In [\cite=bsinprep] we will consider in more detail the question of which surgeries (including Dehn surgeries) on a knot K can be given as the boundary of a negative-definite four-manifold. In particular we will show that Theorem [\ref=thm:L-space-knot-surgery] holds as stated with [formula].

Example: Surgeries on torus knots

In this section we consider torus knots Tp,q; we assume 2  ≤  p < q. Right-handed torus knots are L-space knots since for example pq - 1 surgery on Tp,q yields a lens space [\cite=moser]. Let N = (p - 1)(q - 1) / 2 denote the degree of the Alexander polynomial of Tp,q. The following proposition gives a simple function which approximates the torsion coefficients of a torus knot.

The torsion coefficients of Tp,q are given by

[formula]

and they satisfy ti  ≥  g(N - i) for 0  ≤  i  ≤  N, where x  ↦  g(x) is a piecewise linear continuous function, which equals 0 for [formula] and whose slope on the interval

[formula]

The (unsymmetrised) Alexander polynomial of K = Tp,q is

[formula]

which is a polynomial of degree 2N. Writing K as a formal power series in T we obtain

[formula]

Clearly only the terms in the first product of the last line contribute to the nonzero coefficients of ΔK. A power Tk appears with coefficient + 1 in this term whenever k = ap + bq for some [formula], and with coefficient - 1 whenever k - 1 = ap + bq for some [formula]. Since the coefficient aj in ΔK(T) is the coefficient of TN - j in K(T), we obtain aj = mj - mj + 1, where

[formula]

Then for i  ≥  0

[formula]

In what follows it is convenient to replace ti by

[formula]

Define

[formula]

and [formula]; clearly s̄(i)  ≥  (i) for every i. Separating the set appearing in the definition of s(i) into subsets with fixed value of b we obtain

[formula]

The following corollary describes the range of surgeries on Tp,q that cannot bound negative-definite manifolds according to Theorem [\ref=thm:L-space-knot-surgery] (and using Proposition [\ref=prop:torus-torsion]). To obtain the result of Proposition [\ref=prop:torus-neg-def] note that all the lower bounds in the corollary allow for m = 2. Note that Lisca and Stipsicz have shown that Dehn surgery on T2,2n + 1 with positive framing r bounds a negative-definite manifold (possibly with torsion in H1) if and only if r  ≥  4n [\cite=ls].

Let 2  ≤  p < q and N = (p - 1)(q - 1) / 2.

If p is even and m is less than the minimum of

[formula]

where α = q(p - 2) + 2 and β = q - p + 1

or if p is odd and m is less than the minimum of

where α = q(p - 4) + 2 + 3q / p and β = 2q - p + 1

and 1  ≤  n  ≤  2N + m,

then + n-surgery on Tp,q cannot bound a negative definite four-manifold with no torsion in H1.

Write n = 2N + m; we may assume n < pq - 1. It suffices to show that

[formula]

for - m / 2  ≤  x  ≤  N, where g is the function appearing in Proposition [\ref=prop:torus-torsion].

Since h is convex and g is piecewise linear, it is enough to check the inequality for x = kq with [formula] and for x = N. Consider first x = kq. From the definition of g we obtain g(kq) = qk(k + 1) / 2p. Substituting this into ([\ref=eqn:hg]) we obtain

[formula]

Since q - n / p > 1 / p, it suffices to consider only k = 0 and [formula]. For k = 0 the last inequality yields [formula].

Assume first p is even; then [formula] and substituting this into ([\ref=eqn:hg]) gives

[formula]

Writing μ = m + q(p - 2), α = q(p - 2) + 2 and β = q - p + 1 the last inequality becomes

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

this is equivalent to the second condition on m in the statement of the corollary.

Since the slope of g on the interval from (p / 2 - 1)q to N is 1 / 2, we get g(N) = g((p / 2 - 1)q) + (N - (p / 2 - 1)q) / 2 = (pq - 2p + 2) / 8. Subsituting this into ([\ref=eqn:hg]) gives

[formula]

which holds if n < pq - 2p + 4 or m < q - p + 3.

Assume now p is odd; then [formula] and substituting this into ([\ref=eqn:hg]) gives

[formula]

Writing μ = m + q(p - 3), α = q(p - 4) + 2 + 3q / p and β = 2q - p + 1 the last inequality becomes

[formula]

from which the second condition on m in the statement of the corollary follows.

Now the slope of g on the interval from q(p - 3) / 2 to N is (p - 1) / 2p and g(N) = (pq - 2p + 4 - (q + 2) / p) / 8. Subsituting this into ([\ref=eqn:hg]) gives

[formula]

which holds if [formula] or [formula].
