A particular matrix and its relationship with Fibonacci numbers

Introduction

Let us consider the n  ×  n symmetric matrix [formula]

[formula]

that is

[formula]

This matrix is, up to a positive scalar, the covariance matrix of a stochastic process with increments which possess the same variance and are uncorrelated.

For future reference consider also the (n - k + 1)  ×  (n - k + 1) matrix [formula]

[formula]

For general reference on matrix theory see, for example, [\cite=mario], [\cite=gantmacher], [\cite=rao].

Determinants

Let us consider the following determinants (dimensions n  ×  n)

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] are integers ≥  1. Let us not that the determinant of [formula] is [formula] and that of the matrix [formula] is [formula].

We are going to prove that

[formula]

and

[formula]

We are going to prove the claim using induction.

First of all

[formula]

and

[formula]

Now assume that the claim holds for n - 1. If we evaluate [formula] expanding with respect to the elements of the first row we have that all the algebraic complements except those relative to the first two elements of the row are equal to zero: indeed all the above have identical the first two columns, and we obtain

[formula]

Now reverting to [formula] the same reasoning as before leads to

[formula]

This completes the proof.

As a corollary we see that immediately we have [formula], and [formula].

Symmetric Functions of Eigenvalues

Just to fix notation, given n numbers

[formula]

let [formula] denote the symmetric functions, that is

[formula]

Now given a n  ×  n matrix A with eigenvalues {λi} we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

denotes one of the principal submatrices of A obtained deleting h rows and the corresponding h columns. The number of these submatrices is

[formula]

Note that the submatrices in Equation [\ref=eq:sommadeterminanti] have dimensions k  ×  k.

Considering [formula] we have

[formula]

[formula]

A closed inspection of the structure of the determinants in Equation [\ref=eq:sommadeterminanti] show that

[formula]

We can develop this formula according the index i1 in the following way

[formula]

This shows that we can write

[formula]

In the above formula we set [formula].

Using this equation we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

It follows

[formula]

This formula makes it easy to evaluate [formula] for all n and k.

Consider the following identity relating to binomial coefficients

[formula]

If we set

[formula]

we see that

[formula]

and

[formula]

In this way Equation [\ref=eq:ricorsivaesse] follows from identity [\ref=eq:ricorsivabinomiale], and conversely. So we can conclude that

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

Then Identity 1.76 in [\cite=gould] says

[formula]

where Fi is the i-th Fibonacci number. It follows

[formula]

We can get another recurrence relationship. Indeed from

[formula]

we get

[formula]
