If v is completely bounded (c.b. in short), there is a normal state φ on M such that

where [formula].

Conversely if there are f1,f2 in M*+ such that

Junge [\cite=J] proves that OHn embeds c.i. (with uniform constants) into the predual of a finite dimensional (hence semi-finite!) von Neumann algebra. More precisely, he proves that there is C > 0 so that for any n, there is an integer N, a subspace Fn  ⊂  M*N and a (complete) isomorphism un: OHn  →  Fn such that [formula]. It would be interesting to estimate N as a function of n.

The non-existence of embeddings of OH into M* when M is commutative is rather easy. In that case, even the finite dimensional case (as in the preceding point) is ruled out (see [\cite=P4] for related facts). The paper [\cite=JO] contains stronger results in the same direction.

The above theorem remains valid with essentially the same proof for E = (R,C)θ (with 0 < θ < 1) in the sense of [\cite=P2], but this requires the generalized version of Lemma [\ref=lem1] proved in [\cite=P5]. This implies that, for any 1 < p < 2, the Schatten classes Sp (and hence most non-commutative Lp-spaces) do not embed (c.i.) into the predual of any semi-finite von Neumann algebra.

Let N* be the predual of an injective factor of type III and let M be a (semi-finite) von Neumann algebra of type II∞. Junge proved that OH embeds completely isomorphically into N*. Hence Theorem 1 implies that N* does not embed c.i. into M*. This gives a somewhat partial answer to the (still open) question raised in [\cite=HRS] of the existence of a (Banach space sense) isomorphic embedding of N* into M*.
