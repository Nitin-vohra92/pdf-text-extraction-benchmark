Universal distortion-free entanglement concentration

Entanglement is a major source of wonder of quantum information processing. In many quantum information processing, for example teleporation, and dense coding, it is most desirable to share maximally entangled states  [\cite=B2] [\cite=B1], which makes worthwhile the study of entanglement concentration, or production of a maximally entangled state from given partially entangled pure states through local operations and classical communications (LOCC).

As proven by Bennett et al. [\cite=Ben], when n  (  ≫  1) copies of |φ〉 is shared by Alice and Bob, whose respective Hilbert spaces are denoted by HA and HB respectively, they can produce, through local operations, [formula]-dimensional maximally entangled state with the probability 1 asymptotically. Here, [formula] are the Schmidt coefficients of |φ〉, (i.e., [formula]), with [formula], [formula] is the Shannon entropy of [formula], and k-dimensional maximally entangle state means the state such that [formula]. (Without loss of generality, HA  =  HB = d is assumed.)

In this letter, we treat the case where |φ〉 is unknown, and the perfect (not approximate) entangled state is needed, while the dimension of the obtained entangled state is probabilistic. We propose a protocol {Cn*} which produces a [formula]-dimensional maximally entangled state asymptotically with the probability 1 even in this difficult setting. This kind of protocol is called a universal distortion-free entanglement concentration, while a protocol outputting approximate [formula]-dimensional maximally entangled state is called universal approximate entanglement concentration, whose example is straightforwardly constructed as follows: perform the entanglement concentration protocol of [\cite=Ben] after the estimation of the Schmidt basis of |φ〉 by measuring m (n  ≫  m  ≫  1) copies of |φ〉. In this way, however, the final state is not quite a maximally entangled state, because of the noises caused by the errors in the estimation.

The difficulty of construction of a universal distortion-free concentration mainly comes from the lack of the knowledge about the Schmidt basis: indeed, if the Schmidt basis is known, the protocol of [\cite=Ben] is successfully applied to produce a perfect maximally entangled state. This difficulty is overcome by focusing on the symmetry of the n-tensored pure state [formula].

The merit of our protocol is not only the distortion-free property, but also the optimality for all the universal approximate concentrations, in the sense of smallest failure probability. In the proof, aside from arguments based on symmetry, the statistical estimation theory plays a key role, for concentrated entanglement gives a natural estimate of [formula]. Remarkably, our protocol does not use any classical communication, with its optimal performance.

Symmetry and irreducible decomposition - In this letter, we focus on the two kinds of symmetries. First, our input, n copies [formula] of |φ〉, is invariant by the reordering of copies, or the action of the permutation σ in the set [formula] such that,

[formula]

where |hi,x〉∈Hx    (x = A,B). Second, a natural protocol will be symmetric with respect to the action of local unitary transform [formula] [formula], because the Schmidt basis of |φ〉 is unknown, and universal concentration protocol must be prepared for all the possibility.

Action of these groups occurs a decomposition of the tensored space [formula]  [\cite=Weyl] [\cite=GW] [\cite=Iwa],

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] is an irreducible space of the tensor representation of [formula], and the representation ([\ref=sym]) of the group of permutations respectively, and

[formula]

is called Young index, which [formula] and [formula] uniquely correspond to. In the case of spin-[formula]-system, [formula] is an eigenspace of the total spin operator, with corresponding eigenvalue [formula].

Due to the invariance by the permutation ([\ref=sym]), and with the help of lemmas [\ref=lem:decohere]-[\ref=lem:shur] (see appendix for more detail), any n-tensored state [formula] is written as,

[formula]

Here, [formula] is a state in [formula], which is dependent on |φ〉, while [formula] is [formula]-dimensional maximally entangled state in [formula], which is independent of |φ〉. Our goal is to pull out maximally entangle states [formula], which are embedded in any n copies of entangled pure states.

The protocol {Cn*}- Now, we present the protocol {Cn*}, in which Cn* allows n copies of an arbitrary pure entangled state as its input, outputting a perfect [formula]-dimensional maximally entangled state with almost always in case n  ≫  1. The protocol consists of three operations O1, O2, and O3. ( The operation O1 is needed only to simplify the mathematical analysis, and the protocol performance is not effected by this operation.)

First, both parties independently and randomly choose a unitary transform U,V according to the uniform distribution (Haar measure in [formula]), apply [formula], [formula] to their particles, and erase the information about U,V (operation O1).

By virtue of lemmas [\ref=lem:decohere]-[\ref=l5], the average state is written as, (see the end of the letter for more explanation),

[formula]

where the projection onto a Hilbert space X is denoted also by X, and EU,V denotes the expectation concerning the uniform distribution of U and V.

The state ([\ref=5-5-1]) is a probabilistic mixture of the states [formula] and each of these states is supported on [formula], which is orthogonal with each other. Hence, Alice's measurement [formula] and Bob's measurement [formula] yield the same measurement result [formula], and the state is changed to [formula] (operation O2).

Tracing out unnecessary part [formula] of the state [formula], we finally obtain [formula], which is a maximal entangled state with dimension [formula], with the probability [formula]. (operation O3). Our protocol Cn* obviously satisfies the distortion-free property.

Performance of {Cn*} - A universal entanglement concentration {Cn} is a sequence of LOCC measurements Cn, which allows n copies [formula] of unknown state as its input. Each Cn outputs ρφCn(L), which is approximate to L-dimensional maximally entangled state [formula], together with L as a classical information, with the corresponding probability QφCn(L).

To fit this formalism, our protocol {Cn*} needs one more operation which changes [formula] to [formula]. After this modification, [formula] and [formula], if [formula] for some [formula]. Otherwise, QφCn(L) = 0.

The distortion εφCn of the protocol Cn is defined as the maximum of the square of the Bures' distance between the output ρφCn(L) and the target [formula],

[formula]

In a universal approximate (distortion -free) concentration, lim n  →    ∞εφCn = 0 (εφCn = 0).

We denote [formula], or the probability that the protocol fails to produce maximally entangled state more than L, by PφCn,S. For main difficulty of universal concentration comes from lack of information about Schmidt basis, we consider the failure probability of the worst case with respect to Schmidt basis,

[formula]

where U and V run all over unitary matrices. For the quantity ([\ref=k2]) decreases exponentially as n  →    ∞   (for good protocols), the asymptotic behavior of the protocol performance is nicely characterized by the exponent

[formula]

Using eqs. ([\ref=l3]), the exponent for {Cn*} is calculated as,

[formula]

where [formula] is classical relative entropy.

Eq. ([\ref=fexp1-1]) implies that our protocol achieves entropy rate: if R is strictly smaller than [formula], the failure probability goes to zero, for the r.h.s. of eq. ([\ref=fexp1-1]) is positive;

Our protocol produces the [formula]-dimensional maximally entangled state with probability one, asymptotically, and is distortion-free.

Optimality of {Cn*}- Though there are many kinds of universal approximate/distortion-free concentration protocols, our protocol {Cn*} is optimal;

Our protocol Cn* achieves the optimal value of eq. ([\ref=k2]) for all universal distortion-free concentrations for all finite n.

Our protocol {Cn*} attains the optimal value of eq. ([\ref=exponent]) for all universal approximate concentrations.

Note that the optimality result of theorem [\ref=opt1] is non-asymptotic and holds for any finite number n, while theorem [\ref=optapprox] is an asymptotic result. Note also that the l. h. s. of eq. ([\ref=fexp1-1]) is the same with that of the protocol in [\cite=Ben], which does use the knowledge of the Schmidt basis of the entangled pairs.

Without loss of generality, we can restrict ourselves to the improvement of {Cn*} by some post processing, or the protocols of the form {Cn* + Bn}, where Bn is an LOCC operation.

Here, the operation O + O' means doing the operation O and the operation O' in succession.

For the performance of protocols of the type stated in lemma [\ref=optimal] is symmetric, [formula], there is no need to take maximum of the failure probability in the following.

To improve Cn* by post processing, it is needed to transform smaller dimensional maximally entangled state [formula] to larger one [formula], (M > L), exactly or approximately. Here, the monotonicity of Schmidt rank by LOCC leads to a significant fact: one of the best approximate states to [formula] which can be generated from [formula] is [formula] itself. (Note that we can concentrate on transform to pure state, for any transition to mixed state can be considered to be probability mixture of transitions to pure states, as in [\cite=VidalJonathanNielsen].) Hence, we have;

An optimal post processing is as follows. Do not change the output state, and change the 'label': claim [formula] to be an approximate state to a larger maximally entangled state [formula] with some corresponding probability.

This lemma directly yields theorem [\ref=opt1]. For the proof of theorem [\ref=optapprox], the problem is related to the statistical estimation of [formula], and the results in statistics is made use of. Roughly speaking, the asymptotic performance of {Cn} is bounded by that of the optimal estimate of [formula], because entanglement concentrated by Cn gives natural estimate of [formula] when n  ≫  1.

More precisely, we consider the estimation of [formula] from the classical information L, assuming that L obeys probability distribution QφCn*(L), with |φ〉 being unknown: by a post processing as in lemma [\ref=lem:k1], classical output L of Cn* is changed to M with some corresponding probability, by which the estimate of [formula] is calculated as [formula].

Proof of theorem [\ref=optapprox]  Strong converse theorem of entanglement concentration assures the probability of 'too much success', or achieving the rate more than the entropy of entanglement, tends to zero [\cite=LP] [\cite=Morikoshi]. Therefore, if {Cn} is a universal approximate entanglement concentration, which means {Cn} achieves the entropy rate, the concentrated entanglement 'converges to' (,thus giving nice estimate of), the entropy of entanglement. More rigorously, choosing R, |φ〉, |ψ〉 so that [formula], we have,

[formula]

Therefore, as is proven later, we have Bahadur-type inequality [\cite=Bahadur],

[formula]

whose r. h. s. is evaluated by use of eqs. ([\ref=l3]) as to be [formula]. Therefore, choosing |ψ〉 so that [formula] is infinitely close to R, it is proved that eq. ([\ref=exponent]) is smaller than or equal to the r. h. s. of eq. ([\ref=fexp1-1]), and we have the theorem.

Eq. ([\ref=bahadur2]) is proven as follows [\cite=Bahadur]. Monotonicity of relative entropy implies,

[formula]

which yields,

[formula]

with h(x): =  - x log x - (1 - x) log (1 - x). With the help of eqs. ([\ref=converse]), letting n  →    ∞   of the both sides of this inequality, eq. ([\ref=bahadur2]) is obtained.

Conclusions and discussions - We have proposed a new kind of entanglement concentration, a universal distortion-free concentration, and constructed an example, {Cn*}, which turned out to be optimal not only for all universal distortion-free concentrations, but also for all universal approximate concentrations. Remarkably, our protocol does not use any classical communication.

It is also notable that our protocol gives best estimate of [formula], not only for all LOCC measurements but also for all (possibly global) measurements, in case that the Schmidt basis is unknown: lemma [\ref=optimal] is true in this case too, and information about the input state reflects only in QφCn*, for the output state |V〉 is independent of the input.

In the proof of lemmas [\ref=optimal]-[\ref=lem:k1], which are keys to the proof of optimality, invariance of the performance measure by local unitary operations is the only assumption which is made use of. Therefore, our protocol is optimal also in terms of other invariant performances measures, such as ([\ref=k2])+[formula].

Appendix - Group representation theory -

Let Ug and U'g be an irreducible representation of G on the finite-dimensional space H and H', respectively. We further assume that Ug and U'g are not equivalent. If a linear operator A in [formula] is invariant by the transform [formula] for any g, HAH' = 0.  [\cite=GW]

(Shur's lemma [\cite=GW]) Let Ug be as defined in lemma [\ref=lem:decohere]. If a linear map A in H is invariant by the transform A  →  UgAU*g for any g, [formula].

If the representation Ug(U'h) of the group G(H) on the finite-dimensional space H(H') is irreducible, the representation Ug  ×  U'h of the group G  ×  H in the space [formula] is also irreducible.

Group representation type theory[\cite=KW] [\cite=HMe] [\cite=Ha]  The following inequality and equation in the Appendix of [\cite=HMe] and [\cite=Ha], are useful in the calculation of exponents.

[formula]

where [formula] are the eigenvalues of ρ, and R is an arbitrary closed subset of [formula].

Sketch of proof of eq. ([\ref=decom2])  Establish a correspondence between |φ〉 and the operator [formula] in HA. Letting [formula] be a linear transform in [formula], [formula] is written as  [\cite=GW] [\cite=Iwa],

[formula]

which is equivalent to eq. ([\ref=decom2]), corresponding [formula] ([formula]) to [formula] ([formula]), respectively.

Lemma [\ref=lem:decohere] assures that the 'off-diagonal part' [formula] is zero. The factor [formula] in eq. ([\ref=decom]) is due to the invariance of an input state [formula] by the action ([\ref=sym]) of permutation (Shur's lemma, lemma [\ref=lem:shur]). Two spaces [formula] and [formula] are disentangled, because [formula] and [formula] are maximally entangled.

Sketch of proof of eq. ([\ref=5-5-1])  Lemma [\ref=l5] assures that [formula] is an irreducible space of the tensored representation [formula] of [formula]. Lemmas [\ref=lem:decohere]-[\ref=lem:shur], letting G be [formula], lead to eq. ([\ref=5-5-1]).
