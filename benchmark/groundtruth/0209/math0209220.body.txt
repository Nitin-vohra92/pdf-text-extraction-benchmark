On endomorphisms of projective bundles

It is clear that, for a complex projective variety X, the existence of endomorphisms f:X  →  X of degree bigger than one imposes very strong restrictions on the geometry of X. On the other hand, for any variety B, the product [formula] has such endomorphisms. So it might be interesting to study the following question:

Let X be a projective bundle over a smooth projective complex variety B, p:X  →  B the projection map. When does X admit a surjective endomorphism of degree bigger than one?

This question is the subject of the present article.

Remark that any surjective endomorphism f of X is finite. Indeed, the inverse image map f* on the rational cohomologies of X is injective, because

[formula]

so an isomorphism, but if f contracts a curve, this map obviously cannot be surjective.

We will prove the following

Theorem 1 X admits an endomorphism over B (i.e. commuting with p) and of degree bigger than one if and only if X trivializes after a finite base change.

In other words, the existence of such endomorphisms is equivalent to the existence of a finite covering B' of B with covering group G, such that X is a quotient of the product [formula] by a suitable action of G ( note that if B''  →  B is a finite morphism, then there exist a normal covering B'  →  B which factors through B'', that is, the normalization of B in the splitting field of the extension [formula] ).

It will be clear from the proof ( of the "only if" part ) that the covering B' can be chosen unramified, in other words, our theorem can also be reformulated as follows:

X admits an endomorphism over B of degree bigger than one if and only if X is flat, coming from a representation

[formula]

with finite image.

For example, if B is of general type, then some power of any endomorphism f of X should be over B and thus our theorem answers the question. Indeed, f sends fibers to fibers as B is not covered by rational curves. Therefore f must be over some endomorphism σ of B, i.e.

[formula]

but σ is of finite order and that means that for some n, fn is over B.

As for endomorphisms which are not over the base B, we have only partial results for [formula]-bundles which we describe below.

Let [formula] with E a vector bundle of rank 2. It is clear that if h is an endomorphism of [formula], then some power of it, f = hk, is over an endomorphism g of B (i.e. p  ·  f = g  ·  p.) Indeed, one can characterize the fibers of X as connected curves having zero intersection number with all p*L,L∈NS(B) (by the projection formula). That is, to check that f = hk sends fibers to fibers, it suffices (again by the projection formula) to show that [formula]. As [formula] is a hyperplane in [formula] such that any divisor class D from this hyperplane satisfies Ddim X = 0, [formula] is a hyperplane with the same property. But obviously there is only a finite number of such hyperplanes; h interchanges them and so some power of h must transform each such hyperplane into itself.

So we may suppose X has an endomorphism f of degree > 1 sending fibers to fibers, and there are two different cases:

1) deg (f|Xb) > 1 for a general fiber Xb,b∈B (and hence, as it is easy to see, for all of them);

2) deg (f|Xb) = 1 for all b∈B.

The second case means of course that [formula] where L is a line bundle. A simplest example is that of B an elliptic curve, g the multiplication by an integer and E the only non-trivial extension of the structure sheaf by itself: we have that g*E = E and g extends to an endomorphism of X. This case will not be further considered in this paper.

For the first case, we will prove

Theorem 2: Suppose that [formula] with E a vector bundle of rank 2. If there exists an endomorphism of X which is not of degree one on a general fiber, then E splits into a direct sum of two line bundles after a finite base change.

The converse cannot of course be true as it is clear from the discussion above. The other disadvantage of this theorem is that we are not able to say much about the finite base change which appears. One can nevertheless obtain some more precise results by checking what does the proof of our Theorem 2 give for some particular varieties.

If for example [formula], we obtain the following

Proposition 3 Suppose [formula] and [formula] with E a vector bundle of rank 2. There exists an endomorphism of X of degree bigger than one if and only if E is a direct sum of two line bundles.

The reason is that in the proof of the Theorem 2 we arrive at the following statement (for any B): either X trivializes after a finite unramified covering of B, or E has a subbundle. In the case [formula], it means of course that E splits. The Proposition can also be obtained directly; nevertheless, using the Theorem 2 we see that the existence of endomorphisms implies the splitting of the bundle for the whole class of bases B which are "similar to [formula]", for example, simply connected and such that H1(B,L) = 0 for any line bundle L.

Another remark on this Proposition is that projectivizations of split bundles over [formula] are exactly the projective bundles over [formula] which are toric ( by a lemma of Druel, [\cite=D] ). Toric varieties have obvious endomorphisms. One can ask the following question: is it true that a rational variety with an endomorphism of degree bigger than one, is toric? Though I could not completely check it even for surfaces, I don't know any counterexample.

Throughout the paper, [formula] means the projective bundle of lines in E (not hyperplanes in E), so that [formula].

I am very much indebted to L. Manivel and M. Rovinsky for several suggestions without which the proof of Theorem 1 would be longer and less natural.

1. Proof of Theorem 1

The "if" direction is as follows: if X is a quotient of the trivial bundle by a finite group G as above, then to find an endomorphism of X is the same as to find an endomorphism of [formula] which is equivariant with respect to G. G acts on Sm(V*) in the natural way. It is clear that for a big m one can find a G-invariant f∈Sm(V*) such that its zero locus [formula] is smooth (use Bertini theorem). Choose coordinates [formula] and consider the map [formula]:

[formula]

This is well-defined because D is smooth, and in fact it can be seen as a G-equivariant map from [formula] to its dual: differentiating f(gx) = f(x) (or, equivalently, referring to the Koszul complex), we see that the diagram below is commutative:

[formula]

Repeating this procedure for the dual action of G, we get a morphism   [formula] with gI'(x) = I'((g- 1)tx), and the composition I'I is the equivariant endomorphism which we are looking for.

Before proving the "only if" part of the Theorem, let us state the following

Proposition 1.1 Consider the parameter space [formula] of regular endomorphisms of [formula] given by degree m polynomials, together with the natural action of PGL(r + 1):

[formula]

If m > r + 1, there exists an affine geometric quotient [formula].

The proof is a sequence of lemmas:

Lemma 1.2 [formula] is affine.

Proof: Indeed, [formula] where [formula] is the space of rational self-maps of [formula]. The complement of [formula] in [formula] is the image of the incidence variety [formula] consisting of pairs (x,f) such that f is not defined at x, by the projection p2. It is clear that I is irreducible, p2 is generically finite on I, and the dimension count gives that p2(I) is a hypersurface.

Lemma 1.3 If m > r + 1, a unipotent element U of GL(V) does not stabilize any element of [formula].

Proof: To simplify the notations, we treat the case when U is a single Jordan cell. If f is fixed by U, then by definition

[formula]

for some complex number μ ( where μ does not depend on x because it can be seen as a regular function on [formula], i.e. constant ). Restrict to the projective line [formula]: we get

[formula]

so gr induces a constant function on the affine part {x1  ≠  0} and so is of the form a0,rxm1. Using induction on i, we get that this is also true for

[formula]

So we have

[formula]

for certain [formula].

So, if m is bigger than r, then [formula] for any i, a contradiction.

In the case when U is not a single Jordan cell, the argument remains almost the same, but we have to restrict on the projective line [formula], where i is such that the first non-trivial Jordan cell starts on the ith line.

Lemma 1.4 The only one-parameter subgroup [formula], [formula], which fixes any element of [formula], m > 1, is the group of scalar matrices.

Proof: Let f be fixed by [formula]. Without the loss of generality, we may assume a0  =   min (ai), a1  =   max (ai). Let i0 be such that [formula] and analogously for i1. We have

[formula]

with μ(λ) a complex-valued function of λ, from where

[formula]

But in the same way

[formula]

from where m(a1 - a0) = ai1 - ai0, so, either m = 1 or all ai are equal.

Now there are the classical results ( by Hilbert, Nagata, Mumford and others, see for example [\cite=PV] ) that if U = Spec(A) is an affine variety and G is a reductive group acting on U, then the ring of invariants Spec(AG) is finitely generated, and if moreover G acts in such a way that all orbits are closed in U, then Spec(AG) is a geometric quotient (that is, parametrizes the orbits).

By our lemmas, we are in this situation. Indeed, for any [formula] StabGL(f)  ⊂  GL(V) is an algebraic subgroup which by Lemma 1.3 consists of semisimple elements. Take any of these elements and consider the minimal algebraic subgroup of the stabilizer which contains it; this subgroup is an algebraic quasi-torus and so its connected component of the unity is diagonalizable. By Lemma 1.4, the only one-parameter subgroup in this group can be the center of GL(V), i.e. StabPGL(f)  ⊂  PGL(V) is finite. So all the PGL-orbits are of the same dimension, i.e. closed, and so the Proposition 1.1 follows.

Proof of the "only if" part of the Theorem:

We may of course suppose that an endomorphism f of X over B is given by the polynomials of degree m > r + 1 on the fibers. Consider the projective bundle mB(X,X) (the "bundle of rational self-maps of X") with fiber [formula] and the transition functions rα,β induced from the transition functions gα,β of the projective bundle X over B by the rule

[formula]

Consider the "locus of regular maps" RmB(X,X)  ⊂  mB(X,X). There is a natural surjection

[formula]

( the "quotient map"), which on the fibers is defined by choosing an isomorphism [formula]; this definition is independent of ib as we factorized by all possible coordinate changes.

The endomorphism f is a section of mB(X,X) contained in RmB(X,X). Its image φ(f) is a constant section T  ×  B for some [formula], because [formula] is affine. Let t be a representative of T in [formula].

In a suitable trivialization {(Uα,ψα)} of the bundle X over B, we have fα = hα  ·  t for hα a function on Uα with values in PGL(r + 1). Here "·  " means the natural action of PGL(r + 1) on [formula]: (g  ·  f)(x) = gf(g- 1x).

Refining {Uα} if necessary (in particular choosing them simply connected), we can make hα holomorphic. In fact, consider the subset H  ⊂  Uα  ×  PGL(r + 1):

[formula]

which is obviously a subvariety. The map u:H  →  Uα is finite, and it is clear that one can construct holomorphic sections hα over a suitable refinement of {Uα} provided that u is smooth. The last assertion is true because u is obtained from a smooth map PGL  →  PGL(r + 1)  ·  t by the base change Uα  →  PGL(r + 1)  ·  t given by fα.

So for Uα, Uβ from our covering,

[formula]

and on the intersection Uαβ, fα = gαβ  ·  fβ where gαβ are just the transition functions for X. We therefore have

[formula]

so by changing the trivialization we can make gαβ constant functions with values in a finite group StabPGL(t), q.e.d.

Remark: The case of ruled surfaces over a curve is particularly nice because the finite subgroups of PU(2) are well known: cyclic, dihedral, A4, S4, S5. For each such subgroup G the number of corresponding ruled surfaces can be computed starting with the following classical formula (see e.g. [\cite=S], 7.2, exercises):

[formula]

where g is the genus of C and R is the set of irreducible representations of G.

2. Proof of Theorem 2

Following the remarks from the Introduction, we assume that our endomorphism f:X  →  X satisfies p  ·  f = g  ·  p for some g∈End(B).

The following lemma is well-known, see for example [\cite=H], II.6:

Lemma 2.1 The following problems are equivalent:

1) To find a morphism f:X  →  X, p  ·  f = g  ·  p;

2) To find a surjective bundle map

[formula]

with L a line bundle on X; the line bundle L is then [formula];

3) To find a morphism

[formula]

over B, [formula]

Lemma 2.2 The ramification locus of φ as above cannot contain fibers of X.

Proof: This is just a statement that if a morphism [formula] is given by polynomials of degree k, then its degree is exactly k and not less, which is obvious.

We will prove a statement which is slightly more general than the Theorem 2:

Theorem 2A Let E, F be vector bundles of rank 2 on B, [formula], [formula]. If there exist a morphism [formula] over B which is of degree bigger than one, then E and F both split after a finite base change.

We will follow the strategy of the proof of Theorem 1. First, let V,W be vector spaces of dimension two. Consider the affine variety [formula] of morphisms from [formula] to [formula] given by degree m polynomials, together with the action of PGL(V)  ×  PGL(W):

[formula]

In this case, the quotient (i.e. the spectrum of the ring of invariants) is not a geometric quotient: the orbits are not all closed and so are not separated by the invariants. However, it is easy to understand when different orbits correspond to the same point of the quotient, by the following Proposition:

Proposition 2.3

1) A point [formula] has infinite stabilizer in PGL(V)  ×  PGL(W), if and only if in suitable coordinates, f is written as y0 = xm0,y1 = xm1.

2) An orbit which contains the map y0 = xm0,y1 = xm1 in its closure, consists of maps which in suitable coordinates are of the form y0 = f0(x0,x1),y1 = xm1.

Proof: 1) One can make the same calculations as in Proposition 1.1 : first check that a unipotent (g,h)∈GL(V)  ×  GL(W) does not stabilise any [formula], supposing g and h in Jordan form and making a calculation (of the same kind as before). Then we look for morphisms stabilized by an one-parameter subgroup (diag(λc0,λc1),diag(λb0,λb1)). Let f be such a morphism given by

[formula]

From the invariance of f by the subgroup, we get b0 - c0i - c1(m - i) are equal for all i such that ai  ≠  0, and they are moreover equal to b1 - c0i - c1(m - i) for all i such that a'i  ≠  0.

If c0 = c1, then also b0 = b1 and this is trivial in PGL(V)  ×  PGL(W). If c0  ≠  c1, then at most one of the ai's and one of the a'i's is nonzero. As our f is a morphism of degree m, we get, up to rescaling and permutation of x0 and x1, f0(x0,x1) = xm0 and f1(x0,x1) = xm1.

Alternatively and more geometrically, one can remark that if a map f is fixed by (g,h)∈PGL(V)  ×  PGL(W), then h preserves its ramification locus and g preserves its branch locus. After checking that no positive-dimensional part of the stabilizer can be of the form G  ×  id or id  ×  G, we conclude that both loci consist of two points, which in suitable coordinates are (0:1) and (1:0). The ramification multiplicity at the two ramification points must be of course m - 1 (as it cannot be bigger); we have set-theoretically f- 1((0:1)) = (0:1) and the same for (1:0). Which is what we had to show.

2) Suppose that h is in a non-closed orbit. By a generalization of the Hilbert-Mumford criterion (see [\cite=B], Theorem 4.2, or [\cite=PV], Theorem 6.9), we can reach its border by a suitable one-parameter subgroup [formula]. We may consider Gλ∈SL(V)  ×  SL(W). Choose coordinates such that all Gλ diagonalize:

[formula]

If h is given by

[formula]

we have Gλ  ·  h as follows:

[formula]

If c = 0 but b  ≠  0, then in the limit of Gλ  ·  h as λ goes to zero, we get a constant morphism (from [formula] to 0 or ∞  , depending on the sign of b (so not an element of Rm). Suppose that c > 0 (in the case c < 0 it will be the same computation), so that the exponents (2i - m)c - b and (2i - m)c + b grow together with i. Consider i1  =   min {i,a'i  ≠  0}, and let K = (2i1 - m)c + b. It is clear that if we want to get a non-constant map in the limit, then we must have, for i0  =   min {i,ai  ≠  0}, that (2i0 - m)c - b = K, and the map in the limit will be

[formula]

and, as we want to stay in Rm, either i0 = 0,i1 = m, or vice versa.

Proof of Theorem 2A

Let M be the (affine) quotient [formula], and let M0 be its subset parametrizing closed orbits. Let [formula], [formula], and consider the bundle Rm(X,Y) and the surjection φ:Rm(X,Y)  →  M  ×  B as in the proof of Theorem 1. The image φ(f) is a constant section T  ×  B. If T∈M0, then we repeat the argument of Theorem 1 to conclude that both X and Y trivialize after a finite unramified covering. If T∈M - M0, then the restriction of f to each fiber has a ramification point of multiplicity m - 1, so the ramification divisor of f has a component of multiplicity m - 1. There are two cases possible:

In the first case, this component is the only component of the ramification. Then the restriction of f on each fiber is ramified at two points only, with multiplicity m - 1 at each (as obviously a morphism from [formula] to [formula] cannot have only one ramification point). The ramification is a double covering of the base. After pulling back our projective bundle [formula] to the ramification, we have two non-intersecting sections, giving the splitting of the pull-back.

In the second case, the ramification has an irreducible component R1 of multiplicity m - 1 which is a section of [formula]. We claim it does not intersect the rest R2 of the ramification divisor. Indeed, if it does, then any intersection point with R2 will be a ramification point of multiplicity at least m of a morphism from [formula] to [formula] of degree m, which is impossible. Let B' be an irreducible component of R2. The pullback of X to B' has two non-intersecting sections, so is the projectivization of a split vector bundle.

The bundle F also splits after a finite base change. Indeed, in the first case the branch locus is a double covering of the base, and in the second case the image of R1 is a section and the image of R2 is a multisection which does not intersect the image of R1.

Theorem 2 follows, of course. Unfortunately, the proof does not say much about the base change B'  →  B after which E would split; it is not even clear that one can choose B' non-singular. However the situation is better in some particular cases:

Proposition 2.4 If E is semistable (in the usual sense if B is a curve, or H-semistable with respect to some ample divisor H if dim (B) > 1), then the base change B' can be chosen smooth and unramified over B.

Proof:

Let φ be a morphism from [formula] to [formula] over B, and let ξ resp. ξ' be the tautological divisor classes on X resp. Y. Let k be the degree of φ (on the fibers). By Lemma 2.1, this morphism gives a non-vanishing section of p*F(L) on X, where L = kξ + p*D is the inverse image of ξ'. So in the Chow ring of X we must have

[formula]

Substituting ξ2 =  - ξc1(p*E) - c2(p*E), and taking into account the absence of linear relations between the elements of p*CH2(B) and ξp*CH1(B), we get

[formula]

modulo numerical equivalence.

Now the canonical classes are

[formula]

so the ramification divisor is, up to numerical equivalence,

[formula]

Remark that the determinant of

[formula]

is trivial.

Let M∈|lξ + p*A| be a component of the ramification divisor. By direct image, we have

[formula]

E being H-semistable, so is [formula] ( [\cite=HL], Theorem 3.1.4 ). Computing determinants, we have that if this bundle has a section, then [formula]. As this is true for any component of the ramification, we must in fact have equality.

We now can prove that M is smooth and unramified over B. To check this at the point x∈M, consider the restriction to a curve [formula] where Hi are sufficiently general divisors containing x and from |rH| with r big enough (we want C to be a "sufficiently general curve passing through x" and to be in the cohomology class proportional to Hn - 1). By standard Bertini-type statements, C is smooth and the restriction [formula] is a reduced (but possibly not irreducible) divisor in the ruled surface S = p- 1(C). If we show that MC is smooth and unramified over C, it will follow that M is smooth and unramified over B at the point x.

The statement about MC is implied by the following simple lemma on ruled surfaces:

Lemma 2.5 Let [formula] be a ruled surface over the base curve C, and let ξC be the universal line bundle. Let N be an irreducible divisor on S, which is numerically [formula], m  ≥  1, with D a divisor on C.

1) If deg (D) < 0, then m = 1 (i.e. N is a section);

2) If deg (D) = 0, then N is smooth and unramified over C.

This lemma (in a somewhat different form) appears in [\cite=H] ( Chapter V, Proposition 2.21), so we will not prove it here (the argument is to compare the arithmetic genus of N obtained by adjunction formula, with its geometric genus obtained by Hurwitz' formula).

Now let G = E|C; we have that MC is numerically equivalent to [formula]. If MC is irreducible, we are done. Notice that in any case MC is connected (by a well-known connectedness theorem, see for example [\cite=FL], Theorem 2.1 ). In particular MC cannot split into irreducible components of the same numerical type [formula], as elementary calculation shows that they don't intersect. So, if MC is not irreducible, it must have a component of numerical type [formula], deg (D) < 0. If we compute its intersection number with the rest of MC, we get (l - 2) deg (D); this is non-positive so it is a contradiction. Thus MC is irreducible, smooth and unramified over C, q.e.d.

Remark Trying to apply the similar considerations to the case when E is unstable with respect to all ample divisors, in order to study R1 and R2 appearing in the end of proof of Theorem 2A, we can obtain the followng: if the reduction of R2 is not a section, then the reduction of R1 is a section which comes from the destabilizing subsheaf of E (so that the destabilizing subsheaf is a subbundle independent of the polarisation).

Proof of Proposition 3

Let [formula]. Let [formula] have endomorphisms of degree bigger than one. We must first treat the case not covered by Theorem 2A, that is, the case of endomorphisms being of degree one on fibers. If X has such an endomorphism h, some power of h is over an endomorphism g of [formula] and for this g we have [formula], [formula]. We claim that it is possible only if E is a shift of the trivial bundle. One way to see this is the following: let k be such that g*h = kh for h the hyperplane section divisor. The calculation of Chern classes gives that [formula], and c21(E) = 4c2(E). So by Bogomolov's inequality (see [\cite=Bog], or [\cite=OSS], end of II.2, for our particular case of bundles on [formula]) E is not stable, and if it is semistable, then a destabilizing subsheaf is a subbundle, that is, E is a shift of the trivial bundle. In the case when E is unstable, let F  ⊂  E be the maximal destabilizing subsheaf; the maximal destabilizing subsheaf of [formula] is then [formula]. But [formula] also destabilizes [formula], so kc1(F)  ≤  c1(F) + c1(L). From [formula] and [formula], we obtain a contradiction if k  ≠  1.

So we may assume that f is not of degree one on a general fiber. From the proof of Theorem 2A we see that either X becomes a trivial bundle after a finite unramified covering, which means that X already is trivial, or E has a subbundle. As on [formula], a rank-two bundle with a subbundle splits, the "only if" direction follows.

The "if" part comes from the fact that the projectivization of a direct sum of line bundles over [formula] is toric, and toric varieties have obvious endomorphisms coming from homotheties of the associated fans.

Remark: For V,W vector spaces of higher dimension, we have many non-closed orbits under PGL(V)  ×  PGL(W) in [formula]. What one does obtain, is that the non-closed orbits consist of maps "with an invariant linear subspace": there exist linear subspaces [formula], [formula], such that f- 1(U2) = U1. One then might try to proceed by induction. However, I could not work it out even in dimension 3.
