On the roots of the cubic defining the Tribonacci sequences

Let α,  β,  γ be the roots of the cubic x3 - x2 - x - 1 = 0 (see for example [\cite=mario3], [\cite=elia], [\cite=wolfram]). Define

[formula]

We can write

[formula]

It follows

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

We want to prove

[formula]

We are going to use mathematical induction. First of all U0 = 1,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

These relationships follow from the fact αβγ = 1,  αβ  +  αγ  +  βγ =  - 1,  α  +  β  +  γ = 1. Then

[formula]

Now assume that

[formula]

Because α and β are roots of the cubic x3 - x2 - x - 1 = 0 we have αk  =  αk - 1  +  αk - 2  +  αk - 3, βk  =  βk - 1  +  βk - 2  +  βk - 3, [formula]. Then

[formula]

Furthermore

[formula]

Putting all together our claim is proved. So

[formula]

with initial conditions U0 = 1,  U1 = 1,  U2 = 2, as it can be easily seen. Consider the Tribonacci sequence

[formula]

It follows immediately

[formula]

In an analogous way it can be proved that if α and β are the roots of the quadratic x2 - x - 1 = 0 characterizing Fibonacci sequences (α is the golden ratio) then

[formula]

where Fn are Fibonacci numbers

[formula]

Conjecture.

Let [formula] be the roots of

[formula]

Then

[formula]

where

[formula]

with initial conditions
