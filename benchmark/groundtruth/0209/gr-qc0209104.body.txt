All static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions of Einstein's Equations

Exact solutions of Einstein's field equations provide a route to the physical understanding (and discovery) of relativistic phenomena, a convenient basis from which perturbation methods can proceed and a check on numerical approximations. Here we look at static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions. Unfortunately, even for this simple type, very few solutions are in fact known, and of these few pass even elementary tests of physical relevance [\cite=dellake]. In this paper, an algorithm based on the choice of a single monotone function (subject to boundary conditions) is presented which generates all regular static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions of Einstein's equations. We are interested only in physically relevant solutions here and so the algorithm must be supplemented by physical considerations [\cite=physical]. These additional conditions limit the generating functions allowed by way of non-trivial integral-differential inequalities. The details of how to choose physically relevant generating functions (beyond trial and error) are, at present, not known. Nonetheless, the robustness of the algorithm is demonstrated here by the construction of an infinite number of previously unknown physically interesting exact solutions.

To set the notation, consider a spherically symmetric spacetime M [\cite=metric]

[formula]

where dΩ2 is the metric of a unit sphere (dθ2 + sin2(θ)dφ2) and R = R(x1,x2) where the coordinates on the Lorentzian two space Σ are labelled as x1 and x2. Consider a flow (a congruence of unit timelike vectors uα) tangent to an open region of Σ and write nα as the normal to uα in the tangent space of Σ. Both uα and nα are uniquely determined. We suppose that ([\ref=ss]) is generated by a fluid subject to the condition Gβαuαnβ = 0 where Gβα is the Einstein tensor (see [\cite=lake]). Let [formula] and [formula]. In the static case it follows that the flow is shear free and that

[formula]

is a necessary and sufficient condition for ([\ref=ss]) to represent a perfect fluid [\cite=TOV].

First consider M in "curvature" coordinates,

[formula]

Writing out ([\ref=condition]) [\cite=condition] we obtain an expression involving Φ(r) and m(r) with derivatives to order two in Φ(r) and to order one in m(r). Viewing ([\ref=condition]) as a differential equation in Φ(r), given m(r), we obtain a Riccati equation in the first derivative of Φ(r). However, viewing ([\ref=condition]) as a differential equation in m(r), given Φ(r), we obtain a linear equation of first order [\cite=berger]. As a consequence, we have the following algorithm for constructing all possible spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions of Einstein's equations:

Given Φ(r) (sufficiently smooth and subject to boundary conditions explained below)

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

with [formula] and C a constant. The generating function associated with any known solution is of course immediately obvious following the algorithm.

Interior boundary conditions on Φ(r) are set by the requirement that all invariants polynomial in the Riemann tensor are finite at the origin. In this case there are but three independent invariants [\cite=invariants] and these are expressed here in terms of the physical variables; the energy density

[formula]

and the isotropic pressure

[formula]

Note that the inequalities in ([\ref=energy]) and ([\ref=pressure]) are to be viewed as imposed restrictions on Φ(r). At the centre of symmetry (r = 0) the regularity of the Ricci invariants requires that ρ(0) and p(0) be finite. The regularity of the Weyl invariant requires that m(r) is C3 at r = 0 with m(0) = m(0)'  =  m(0)''  =  0 and m(0)''' = 8πρ(0) [\cite=schw]. In summary, for a static spherically symmetric perfect fluid, finite ρ(0) and p(0) guarantees the regularity of all Riemann invariants at the centre of symmetry. Φ(0) is a finite constant (set by the scale of t) and it follows from ([\ref=pressure]) that Φ'(0) = 0 and [formula]. Since [formula] and continuous and since p(0) > 0 and finite it follows from ([\ref=condition]) that r > 2m(r) [\cite=br]. With r > 2m(r) for r > 0 it also follows from ([\ref=pressure]) for p(r) > 0 that Φ'(r)  ≠  0 for r > 0. As a result, the source function Φ(r) must be a monotone increasing function with a regular minimum at r = 0. Exterior boundary conditions on Φ(r) exist only for isolated spheres and these conditions are set by junction conditions [\cite=junctions]. The necessary and sufficient condition that M have a regular boundary surface with a Schwarzschild vacuum exterior at r = R > 0 is given by p(r = R) = 0. Setting [formula] it follows that [formula].

Each source function Φ(r) which is a monotone increasing function with a regular minima at r = 0 necessarily gives, via ([\ref=mass]), a static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solution of Einstein's equations which is regular at r = 0. Exact solutions, in the present context, can be viewed as those for which ([\ref=mass]) can be evaluated without recourse to numerical methods. The number of source functions Φ(r) for which ([\ref=mass]) can be evaluated exactly is infinite. It should be noted, however, that the generation of an exact solution does not necessarily mean that the equation p(r = R) = 0 can be solved exactly. The algorithm presented here is now demonstrated by the construction of an infinite number of previously unknown but physically interesting exact solutions of Einstein's equations.

Let

[formula]

where N is an integer [formula] and α is a constant > 0. The function ([\ref=tolman]) is monotone increasing with a regular minimum at r = 0. With the source function ([\ref=tolman]), ([\ref=mass]) can be evaluated exactly for any N. Whereas ([\ref=tolman]) generates a "class" of solutions, the metric (in particular m(r)) looks quite distinct, and the physical properties are quite distinct, for each value of N. Previously, only for N = 1,...,5 were solutions known, having been arrived at by various methods, and one solution which is the first term in the Taylor expansion of ([\ref=tolman]) [\cite=tolmaniv]. (These solutions, with N = 1,...,5, in fact constitute half of all the previously known physically interesting solutions (of this type) in curvature coordinates.) For [formula] the solutions are acceptable on physical grounds and even exhibit a monotonically decreasing subluminal adiabatic sound speed [\cite=new].

It is, perhaps, worth noting here that the foregoing discussion in curvature coordinates can be transformed directly into Bondi radiation coordinates [\cite=bondi].

Now consider "isotropic coordinates"

[formula]

Unlike curvature coordinates, the isotropic form ([\ref=standardformiso]) does not offer an immediate invariant physical interpretation of the functions Ψ() or B() [\cite=isometric]. However, as we now show, the coordinates offer a simplified algorithm for constructing perfect fluid solutions. Writing out ([\ref=condition]) we now obtain an expression involving Ψ() and B() with derivatives to order two in Ψ() and to order one in B(). Viewing ([\ref=condition]) as a differential equation in Ψ(), given B(), we again obtain a Riccati equation in the first derivative of Ψ(). However, viewing ([\ref=condition]) as a differential equation in B(), given Ψ(), we obtain an equation solvable simply by quadrature. As a consequence, we have the following simplified algorithm for constructing all possible spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions of Einstein's equations in isotropic coordinates:

Given Ψ() (sufficiently smooth and subject to boundary conditions explained below)

[formula]

where

[formula]

with ε  =    ±  1, [formula] and C a constant. Recently, Rahman and Visser [\cite=visser] have also presented an algorithm for constructing spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions in isotropic coordinates. The source function Ψ() used here is related to the source function z() used by Rahman and Visser as follows:

[formula]

The two algorithms differ fundamentally in the sense that only one integration is used in the present procedure as opposed to two distinct integrations used in the Rahman-Visser procedure. The Rahman-Visser procedure was motivated by the requirement that metric be manifestly real ab initio. The reality of the integral ([\ref=bsource]) is discussed below.

Interior boundary conditions on Ψ() are set exactly as in the case of curvature coordinates. We now have the energy density and pressure in the form

[formula]

and

[formula]

Ψ(0) is a finite constant (set by the scale of t) and it follows from ([\ref=pressureiso]) that Ψ'(0) = 0 and from ([\ref=bsource]) that B'(0) = 0. With p()  ≥  0 it follows that the source function Ψ() must be a monotone increasing function with a regular minimum at  = 0 and Ψ''(0) = 4πe2B(0)p(0). Exterior boundary conditions on Ψ() are set as in curvature coordinates. Regularity of ρ(0) requires B'(0) = 0 and with ρ()  ≥  0 it follows that B() must be a monotone decreasing function with a regular maximum at  = 0 and B''(0) =  - 4πe2B(0)ρ(0). The limits [formula] guarantee the positivity of the effective gravitational mass. To examine the reality of the metric consider the function [formula]. Now F(0) = 0,  F'(0) = 0 and F''(0) > 0 so F(r) has a local minimum at r = 0. Now suppose that F(r) = 0 for r > 0. Then condition ([\ref=condition]) requires B'  =  Ψ' so we have already passed through a region with ρ < 0 before the reality of the metric breaks down (in agreement with known theorems [\cite=br]).

In parallel to the algorithm in curvature coordinates, each source function Ψ() which is a smooth monotone increasing function with a regular minima at  = 0 necessarily gives, via ([\ref=bsource]), a static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solution of Einstein's equations which is regular at  = 0. Exact solutions are again those for which ([\ref=bsource]) can be evaluated without recourse to numerical methods. Physical considerations must guide the choice of Ψ(). In isotropic coordinates, ratios of invariants and differential invariants can be obtained directly from the source function Ψ() via differentiation. You do not need B() and in particular you do not need to integrate. For example, the functions p() / ρ() and p'() / ρ'() follow directly without integration. Of course, neither p() nor ρ() follow without integration. In curvature coordinates you cannot get these ratios without integration, starting from the source function Φ(r).

To demonstrate the algorithm in isotropic coordinates let

[formula]

where α is a constant > 0. Of course it is not difficult to find functions f() and g() so that ([\ref=isogen]) is monotone increasing with a regular minimum at  = 0. Nor indeed is it difficult to find such functions for which B() can be evaluated exactly. For example, let g() = (δ  +  ε2)ζ and f() = δζ  +  γ2 with δ,ε,γ and ζ constants such that δ  >  0 and δ1 - ζγ  >  ζε. This class of solutions includes a number of known solutions including the Schwarzschild interior solution and the Rahman-Visser general quadratic ansatz. Any solution in isotropic coordinates can be immediately recovered and generalized following the algorithm presented [\cite=isosolutions].

An algorithm based on the choice of a single monotone function (subject to boundary conditions) has been presented which generates all regular static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions of Einstein's equations. In all cases the choice of generating function must be guided by physical considerations. These additional conditions limit the generating functions allowed by way of non-trivial integral-differential inequalities. The details of how to choose physically relevant generating functions (beyond trial and error) are, at present, not known. Moreover, the resultant equation of state is a byproduct of the algorithm and can not be set a priori. Despite these reservations, the algorithm has been demonstrated by the construction of an infinite number of previously unknown physically interesting exact solutions [\cite=number]. It is a curious fact of history that over half a century ago Max Wyman [\cite=wyman] pointed out that the algorithm presented here was possible and yet, despite the voluminous literature on the subject [\cite=dellake], the algorithm appears not have been followed up.
