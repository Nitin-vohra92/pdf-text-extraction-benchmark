Observation of narrow baryon resonance in pK0s mode in pA-interactions at 70 GeV / c with SVD-2 setup.

SVD-2 experiment

The present analysis was made in a framework of SVD-2 experiment, the main goal of which is a study of the charm hadroproduction at the near-threshold energy[\cite=svd0] [\cite=svd1] [\cite=svd2]. SVD-2 setup consists of high-precision microstrip vertex detector (beam telescope, active target and tracking detector), large aperture magnetic spectrometer, multicell threshold Cherenkov counter and Cerenkov full absorption lead glass gamma detector.

The primary vertex position determination procedure was based on well-known "tear-down" approach [\cite=tear1] [\cite=tear2]. Only events with a well reconstructed primary vertex were selected. After excluding the tracks that belongs to primary vertex, the secondary vertex position was determined by finding V0-decay downstream the primary vertex. The primary vertex resolution was estimated as 70 - 120 ~ μm for Z-coordinate and 8 - 12 ~ μm for X(Y)-coordinates. For the two-tracks secondary vertices (K0s, Λ) those values were 250 ~ μm and 15 ~ μm respectively. The impact parameter resolution for 3 - 5 GeV momentum tracks is about 12 ~ μm. The angular acceptance of the vertex detector averages to ±  250 mrad.

The SVD-2 setup permits obtaining the high effective mass resolution of σ  =  4.4 ~ MeV / c2 for K0s and 1.6 ~ MeV / c2 for Λ0 masses (see fig.[\ref=k0_lambda_mass]). The momentum resolution for the track with 15 measured hits is [formula] in the [formula] momentum range. The angular measurement error was estimated to be [formula]. The angular acceptance of spectrometer averages to [formula] for horizontal and [formula] for vertical coordinates.

The combined (π+K0s) and (π-K0s) invariant mass spectrum is shown on fig.[\ref=sigma_ks_mass]a. The K*(892) peak is clearly seen on the distribution. Fig.[\ref=sigma_ks_mass]b shows (Λ0π+) invariant mass spectrum. Σ+(1385) peak is clearly seen. The masses of observed K0s, Λ0 and also masses and widths of K*(892) and Σ+(1385) are consistent with their PDG values[\cite=pdg].

Θ+-baryon searches

Exotic baryons with 5-quarks content (pentaquarks) and their properties have been predicted by Diakonov, Petrov, and Polyakov [\cite=Diakonov] in the framework of the chiral soliton model, although such 5-quarks structures were proposed years ago [\cite=jaffe1] [\cite=pras]. The lightest member of the pentaquarks antidecuplet, Θ+-baryon, has positive strangeness, mass M  ~  1530 ~ MeV / c2, Γ  ≤  15 ~ MeV / c2, spin 1 / 2 and even parity.

Experimental evidence for Θ+-baryon with positive strangeness came recently from several experimental groups (LEPS[\cite=Nakano], DIANA-ITEP [\cite=Dolgolenko] [\cite=itep], CLAS [\cite=Ken] [\cite=vpk] [\cite=clas2], SAPHIR [\cite=SAPHIR]). In those experiments Θ+-baryon was observed in the nK+ or pK0s invariant mass spectra with the mass near 1540 ~ MeV / c2. More recently HERMES collaboration observed narrow baryon state at the mass of 1528 MeV / c2 in quasi-real photoproduction[\cite=hermes]. Also ZEUS collaboration [\cite=zeus] reported an evidence of the exotic baryon in pK0s-channel with the mass of 1527 MeV / c2.

Events selection and pK0s-spectrum analysis.

We were searching for the Θ+-baryon in the reaction pN  →  Θ+  +  X,  Θ+  →  pK0s,  K0s  →  π+π-. The data pre-selected at the search for the charm production were used. It consisted of events with V0-candidates decayed within the vertex detector: decay length ≤  35 mm with a mean of 20 mm. The following criteria were then applied:

Primary charged particles multiplicity [formula]. Minimizes the combinatorial background, reduces the probability of appearance of the events with rescattering on nuclei and background of K0s-mesons produced in the central rapidity region.

A presence of proton as well-measured primary positive track with a momentum of 4 GeV / c  ≤  Pp  ≤  21 GeV / c leaving no hit in Cherenkov counter.

490 MeV / c2  ≤  Mπ+π-  ≤  505 MeV / c2 to select well-identified K0s.

cos(α)  ≥  0, where α is angle of flight of pK0s-system in the center mass system of the beam proton and the target nucleon(beam proton fragmentation region).

PK0s  ≤   ~ Pp kinematical cut [\cite=levtch]: effectively destroys most of the decays of Σ*  +-resonances with high masses while cutting only 10% of Θ+-peak events.

Resulting distribution is shown on fig. [\ref=theta]. The distribution was fitted by Gaussian function and fourth-order polynomial background. There are 50 events in the peak over 78 background events. The statistical significance for the fit inside a 45 MeV / c2 mass window was calculated as [formula], where NB is the number of counts in the background fit under the peak and NP is the number of counts in the peak. We estimate the significance to be of 5.6 ~ σ. It is impossible to determine the strangeness of this state in such an inclusive reaction, however there are no reported Σ*  +-resonances in [formula] mass area, so we interpret observed state as recently reported Θ+-baryon with a positive strangeness.

The A-dependence analysis in the observed peak area showed no difference (within measuring errors) from the A0.7 dependence for background inelastic events (fig. [\ref=adepend]).

In a summary, the inclusive reaction pA  →  pK0s  +  X was studied at IHEP accelerator with proton energies at 70 GeV using SVD-2 detector. With several cuts applied a narrow baryon resonance was observed with mass M = 1526  ±  3(stat.)  ±  3(syst.) MeV / c2 and Γ  <  24 MeV / c2. The width of this state is close to SVD-2 experimental resolution for pK0s-system and its mass and width are consistent with recently reported Θ+-resonance[\cite=Nakano] [\cite=Dolgolenko] [\cite=Ken] [\cite=vpk] [\cite=SAPHIR] [\cite=itep] [\cite=clas2] [\cite=hermes], which was predicted as an exotic pentaquark (uudds̄) baryon state.
