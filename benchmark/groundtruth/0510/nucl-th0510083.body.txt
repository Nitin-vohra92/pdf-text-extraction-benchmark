Heavy Ion e+e- Pairs to All Orders in Z α

Introduction

A two center light cone calculation of continuum pairs can be carried out by exactly solving the semi-classical Dirac equation[\cite=sw] [\cite=bm] [\cite=sw2] [\cite=er] for colliding δ function potentials

in the collider center of mass (lab) frame, where

Baltz and McLerran[\cite=bm] originally noted an agreement with perturbation theory in the exact result. Segev and Wells[\cite=sw2] noted this agreement and also noted the scaling with Z21Z22 seen in SPS data for 160 GeV/c Pb ions on C, Al, Pa, Au and for 200 Gev/c S ions on C, Al, Pa, Au. The experimental group, Vane et al., summarized their data: "Cross sections scale as the product of the squares of the projectile and target nuclear charges[\cite=vd]."

On the other hand, photoproduction on a heavy target shows a negative correction proportional to Z2[\cite=bethe]. Several authors have argued that a correct regularization of the exact Dirac equation amplitude should lead to Coulomb corrections[\cite=serbo] [\cite=lm].

Cross Section with Higher Order Coulomb Corrections

I have previously showed how a physical cutoff of the transverse potential Λ±() leads to Coulomb corrections[\cite=ajb3] consistent with the Lee and Milstein approximate analytical result[\cite=lm]. In this section I present recent "exact" Dirac equation calculations of total cross sections that make use of this physical cutoff[\cite=ajb4].

Table [\ref=tab1] shows the results of exact numerical calculations indicating reductions from perturbation theory. In addition, calculations of positron transverse and longitudinal spectra show that the reductions persist to the highest and lowest momentum values.

Note that the total cross section at CERN SPS energy is reduced from perturbation theory by 28%, a disagreement with the experimentally presented perturbative scaling. Nevertheless, given the difficulty of the SPS experiment as described by the authors, I would argue that the apparent lack of Coulomb corrections in the data needs to be verified in other ultrarelativistic heavy ion experiments.

RHIC STAR Data

e+e- pair production accompanied by nuclear dissociation has been measured by STAR. Comparison with perturbative QED calculations allowed a limit to be set "on higher-order corrections to the cross section, - 0.5σQED  <  Δσ  <  0.2σQED, at a 90% confidence level[\cite=star]."

Calculations in the STAR acceptance without dissociation provide an indication of the relative difference between perturbation theory and the exact result. In the STAR acceptance the exact result is calculated to be 17% lower than perturbation theory. This rough estimate, Δσ  =   - 0.17σQED, is not excluded by STAR.

Forward Pairs at LHC

A sample numerical calculation has been performed using the same method for e+e- production by Pb + Pb ions with cuts from a possible detector setup at LHC. With electron and positron energy E and angle θ in the range, 3 Gev  <  E  <  20 GeV and .00223 radians  <  θ  <  .00817 radians, the no form factor perturbation theory cross section of 2.88 b is reduced by 18% to 2.36 b in an exact numerical calculation.

If forward e+e- pairs are to be employed for luminosity measurements at LHC, then it seems necessary to consider the Coulomb corrections to the predicted cross sections.

Probabilities at Small Impact Parameter: the Zero Impact Parameter Limit

Zero degree calorimeter (ZDC) triggering (e.g. for the STAR pair production) weights smaller parameter contributions: the probability at each impact parameter goes as the product of the dissociation probabilty (ZDC) and the pair production probability. Pair production probability as a function of impact parameter is needed to describe ZDC triggered events as was done for ρ production at STAR[\cite=rho]. I calculate the number weighted probability PT (or number operator), [formula], for producing e+e- pairs at some impact parameter b. As a first step I compute the [formula] limit.

For Au + Au at RHIC the pertubation theory result is P0(0)  =  1.64, the exact result P(0)  =  .94, or P(0)  =  .57P0(0). This limit may have some relevance to the very high energy pairs measured by STAR which necessarily come from relatively low impact parameters. Again - 0.5σQED  <  Δσ  <  0.2σQED from STAR is not contrary the indications from the exact result in this limit.

For Pb + Pb at LHC the pertubation theory result is P0(0)  =  4.07, and the exact result is P(0)  =  2.39  =  .59P0(0).

Conclusions

A full numerical evaluation of the "exact" total cross section for e+e- production with gold or lead ions shows reductions from perturbation theory of 28% (SPS), 17% (RHIC), and 11%(LHC). Reductions are 43% (RHIC), and 41%(LHC) for b  =  0. For large Z no final momentum region was found in which there was no reduction or an insignificant reduction of the exact cross section.

For the Future

The predicted reduction of continuum e+e- pair production from Z2AZ2B scaling at higher Z has never been observed experimentally. An obvious suggestion for experiment is to compare electromagnetic e+e- pair production in Au + Au with e.g. Ca + Ca at RHIC or LHC.

There is also a clear need to construct a computer program to calculate P(b) exactly for e+e- to all order in Zα.
