Hawking radiation and Quasinormal modes

Loop quantum gravity [\cite=Rovelli_et_all] is a background independent, non-perturbative approach to unify general relativity and quantum physics. There has been a lot of progress, especially in the resolution of the big-bang singularity [\cite=Martin], even though we have physical states only in the kinematical level in loop quantum gravity and solving the hamiltonian constraint [\cite=Thiemann1] is still a open problem and the description of low energy physics [\cite=Yoon] is not fully understood yet.

In loop quantum gravity, there is the Immirzi parameter γ [\cite=Immirzi]. Neither phase space variables nor their Poisson brackets depend on this parameter. Thus the canonical phase space is γ independent. Therefore there is no ambiguity in quantization [\cite=Ashtekar]. However the expression of the geometrical fields -the spatial triad and the extrinsic curvature- in terms of canonical variables depends on it, so to fix the value of γ is important to figure out the correct semiclassical limit.

One of the ways to fix the value of the Immirzi parameter was proposed using SO(3) gauge group instead of SU(2) [\cite=Dreyer]. This was motivated by observation [\cite=Hod] on the quasinormal modes of a black hole with using Bohr's correspondence principle: "Transition frequencies at large quantum numbers should be equal to classical oscillation frequencies." Even though a fair argument was made to specify the imaginary part of quasinormal mode as a quantum number in term of the relaxation time [\cite=Hod], there is a criticism for using the correspondence principle [\cite=Khriplovich]. If we can find any quantum mechanical role of the quasinormal modes, above observation would be supported without the correspondence principle. However we find that there is no Hawking radiation by quasinormal modes in the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime.

Fredenhagen and Haag derived Hawking radiation [\cite=Hawking1] by the local behavior of the correlation functions, <  φ(x1)  ·    ·    ·  φ(xn)  >   , of the quantum field [\cite=Fredenhagen]. What they found was that the asymptotic counting rate of the two-point correlation function of the smeared quantum field living on a Schwarzschild black hole background is governed by the short distance behavior of the ground state two-point function near the horizon, so-called Hadamard form [\cite=Wald]. The smeared field

[formula]

where the test function h is a smooth function with support in the region far away from the horizon. Expression of the counting rate < Q*TQT  >   involves the function fT as

[formula]

where T is used as the index of a sequence QT which are time translates with respect to the Schwarzschild time t and fT,t0 is the solution of the wave equation with the initial conditions

[formula]

With this

[formula]

where τ = t + r* - r, r* is the Regge-Wheeler tortoise coordinate [\cite=Wheeler], and

[formula]

[formula]

where r0 is the Schwarzschild radius, σε is the square of the geodesic distance between x1 and x2, and ŵ(2) is the less singular part of W(2)(x1,x2) which has the Hadamard form. After separating off the angular part, fT can be obtained by inverse Laplace transformation

[formula]

where t < T + t1 with t1 = inf{t0|(t0,r*)∈ support of h} and [formula] is the solution of the ordinary inhomogeneous differential equation by Laplace transformation of the original solution of the wave equation

[formula]

with

[formula]

where l is a index of angular momentum.

What is important in description of Hawking radiation is the behavior of fT. This can be decomposed into three parts

[formula]

As T - t  →    ∞  , fT- is accumulating on the horizon and fT+ is moving to spatial infinity and the third term vanishes. The counting rate is dominated by fT- and is governed by the short distance behavior of the state near the horizon [\cite=Fredenhagen].

We can express the counting rate with quasinormal modes. We can write eq.(7) with quasinormal modes by closing the contour to the left plane

[formula]

where zq are quasinormal mode frequencies. The solution of eq.(8) can be obtained by the Green function method. Let G+, G- be the solutions of the homogeneous part of eq.(8) with respective boundary conditions

[formula]

In term of G+ and G-, [formula] is given by

[formula]

where δ(z) is the Wronskian between G- and G+,

[formula]

Quasinormal mode frequencies {zq} are given by zeros of the Wronskian δ(z) and at z = zq, G- and G+ are equal up to a constant factor.

To express < Q*TQT  >   as the sum of each quasinormal mode, we insert eq.(7) to eq.(4), interchange the order of the integral in eq.(7) and the integral in eq.(4) and closing the contour of eq.(7). We can not insert eq.(11) to eq.(4) and interchange the order of the sum in eq.(11) and the integral in eq.(4) because each mode behaves as e2zqr* around the horizon and the integral diverges. Therefore without regularization, we can not convince that < Q*TQT  >   as the sum of each quasinormal mode converges. If we take the interval of r in eq.(4) between r  >  r0 and ∞  , and take r goes r0 after taking T goes ∞  , we can see that < Q*TQT >  = 0. In general, if < Q*TQT  >   converges, it is 0 by the exponential decaying factor of ezqT.

We saw that Hawking radiation at late time is not explained by quasinormal modes. At finite time, eq.(11) is a very good approximation, but fT is not dominated by the asymptotic frequency which decays very fast. In addition to this, we do not see any special role of the horizon. Even though the counting rate can be written by the quasinormal modes expansion, we can not interpret this as particle creation by black hole.
