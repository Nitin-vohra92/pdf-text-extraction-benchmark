Introduction

Canonical quantization is the art of establishing a correspondence - following Dirac rules - between a classical (or pseudoclassical) model and a quantum system. Its universal status is questionable, since one cannot discard the possibility quantum mechanics to exist - in some particular cases - on its own right, without any relation to some (pseudo-)classical mechanics. On the other hand, canonical quantization has proven its efficiency on a vast variety of examples.

The inverse problem - that of finding a (pseudo-)classical system reproducing, upon quantization, given quantum dynamics - is also interesting. In particular, after this problem being solved, a path integral for the quantum system can be obtained.

The pseudoclassical relativistic particle models [\cite=bm75] [\cite=casalbuoni76] generally reproduce the consistent quantum mechanics [\cite=gg00] of the one-particle and one-antiparticle sectors of the corresponding quantum field theory. Two cases have resisted the attempts to obtain a pseudoclassical model yelding a consistent quantum mechanics upon canonical quantization. These are the massive spin-1/2 particle in odd-dimensional space-time (with a given value of spin) and the massless particle. In both cases the problem is to obtain a "minimal" model. Indeed, a theory, reproducing, for example, the quantum mechanics of a spin-1/2 particle with both signs of spin in (2+1)-dimensional space-time, can be easily obtained by reduction from the spinning particle model in (3+1) dimensions. A common technical problem arises in the both cases: a first-class bifermionic constraint which does not admit gauge fixing [\cite=fggm04].

In the present paper we propose a pseudoclassical model for the massless spinning particles which is free of the problem. The pseudoclassical action is extracted from a path integral in a way similar to that of Refs. [\cite=fg91] [\cite=gitman97]. In order to obtain a canonically quantizable model we had to solve the bifermionic constraint problem, as well as the bifermionic constant problem [\cite=fggm04]. We looked for a model satifying certain condititions. The most important among them was to obtain a bifermionic constraint belonging to a set of second-class constraints, instead of being a first-class constraint. Also, we looked for a model with the simplest possible constraint structure and, in particular, leading to the same set of first-class constraints as in the (massless) spinless case.

The canonical quantization of the model reproduces the quantum mechanics of the one-fermion state and that of the negative-energy states, corresponding to the antifermion states.

In order to reproduce the dynamics in the chiral sectors, i.e., the dynamics of states of given chirality, we propose a quaternionic generalization of the pseudoclassical mechanics. The 'algebra of functions on the the phase space' is assumed to be an algebra over biquaternions (a quaternionic bimodule). This allows us to develop a pseudoclassical scheme which reproduces, upon canonical quantization, the quantum mechanics in the chiral sectors. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 pseudoclassical action is derived from a a path integral for the propagator. The discrete symmetries of the action are studied in Sect. 3. The Hamiltonian formulation is given in Sect. 4. Canonical quantization is performed in Sect. 5.

The path integral

The propagator Sc of the free massless Dirac field satisfies the equation

[formula]

and Feynman assymptotic conditions. In order to get an action, leading to a suitable set of constraints, we obtain a path-integral expression for the function

[formula]

It can be expressed, following Schwinger [\cite=schwinger51], as a matrix element of an operator in a Hilbert space. Let X̂μ, P̂μ be a set of operators, generating an irreducible representation of the canonical commutation relations

[formula]

in a Hilbert space, in such a way that

[formula]

where |x〉 is an eigenvector for all Xμ and ψ is an arbitrary vector from a suitable dense set in the Hilbert space. Then

[formula]

where

[formula]

αk  =  γ0γk (k = 1,2,3), and the weak limit ε  →  0 +  is understood. We omit the term iε in the sequel. One can use the Schwinger proper-time representation [\cite=schwinger51] for the inverse operator 1 / P̂2,

[formula]

As to the factor [formula], it could be represented by an integral over a pair of Grassmann variables [\cite=gitman97], χ1 and χ2 ,

[formula]

Some other possibilities also exist. Let B be some quantity, then

[formula]

where C is a curve circling around the origin in the z-plane. Using eqs. ([\ref=denominator]), ([\ref=numerator2]) and

[formula]

in ([\ref=deltaop]), one obtains

[formula]

The integrand can be considered as an evolution operator for a quantum-mechanical system with Hamiltonian

[formula]

A path integral for the matrix element in ([\ref=hatdelta1]) is obtained in the standard way [\cite=fg91] [\cite=gitman97]. Using the completness relation

[formula]

and introducing δ-functions in s, u and v, one obtains

[formula]

where [formula]. Evaluating the matrix element,

[formula]

and using integral representations for the δ-functions one obtains

[formula]

where u0 + iv0 = z, s0  =  λ, h0  =  γ5 and [formula] indicates an ordered exponent (α-matrices in the factors with greater value of k stay to the left of the ones with smaller k). Making the rescaling λ = e0 / 2, sk = ek / 2, Psk = 2Pek and taking the limit Δkτ  →  0, one obtains the path integral

[formula]

The time-ordered exponent in eq. ([\ref=integral1]) can be expressed as a linear combination of antisymmetrized products of α-matrices by means of a path-integral technique [\cite=fg91] [\cite=gitman97] [\cite=gzb98]) with the result

[formula]

where [formula] is a Grassmann-odd trajectory, θk are Grassmann-odd parameters, and the translationally-invariant measure [formula] is normalized,

[formula]

Performing the integration over the trajectories in the momentum space p one obtains the path integral in the Lagrangian form

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

The action and its symmetries

The gauge-fixing terms [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] and the symbol-defining term [formula] apart, the argument of the exponent in ([\ref=integral-l]) is the action. Since the complex nature of the variable z = u + iv is not essential, we put v = 0 and the action takes the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

The action ([\ref=action]) is reparametrization invariant. It is also invariant under space reflection P if the variables are transformed as follows

[formula]

and under the time reflection [formula],

[formula]

The dynamics is invariant under the trajectory-reversal operation R, i.e.,

[formula]

where [formula] is obtained by the following substitutions in L, eq. ([\ref=action]):

[formula]

Consequently, the equations of motion are invariant under the (pseudoclassical counterpart) of the Wigner time inversion operation

[formula]

Pseudoclassical mechanics

The pseudoclassical mechanics can be formulated in terms of the [formula]-graded associative algebra A, generated by the canonical variables. For some of the non-nilpotent variables we assume the existence of the corresponding inverses. The phase space Γ is a supermanifold [\cite=DeWitt92]. We are not going to specify the structure here. However, we refer to the elements of A as to functions on the phase space.

The evolution of a function on the phase space with the evolution parameter τ is governed by the Hamiltonian equations. The evolution parameter τ can also be understood as a Grassmann-even generating element in a larger algebra [formula], generated by the canonical variables and τ. The element τ has vanishing Poisson brackets with any function on the phase space.

The constraints are understood as conditions, defining an equivalence relation in A. We limit ourselves to the case of τ-independent constraints. Two elements f and g of [formula] are considered equivalent if the difference f - g is "proportional to the constraints", i.e., if

[formula]

where Φa ([formula]) are the constraint functions and Fi, Gi are algebra elements. Obviously, this define a quotient algebra [formula] (the algebra of functions on the constraint suface). Suppose that the set of all constraints is a second-class one. If Dirac brackets with respect of this set are used, the Hamilton equations define a consistent evolution in the quotient algebra [formula].

Hamiltonian formulation

The canonical momenta Pe, Pu, and Ph, conjugate to e, u, and h, correspondingly, vanish. The momenta conjugate to ψk are given by

[formula]

There are six primary constraints in the theory. The constraint functions are

[formula]

and the Hamiltonian H(1) is given by

[formula]

where λα are Lagrange multipliers associated with the constraints. The constraints Φ4i can be eliminated. Under a change of the fermionic variables,

[formula]

one finds that the new variables have the following Poisson brackets:

[formula]

and Φ(1)4i  =  ξi. The conservation of the constraint functions Φ(1)4i implies λ4i = 0 and the terms in H(1), linear in ξk, vanish. On the other hand, the Poissonn brackets with all the variables of the terms in H(1), bilinear in ξk, vanish on the constraint surface and can be omitted. The Hamiltonian takes the form

[formula]

The conservation of the primary constraints Φ(1)1, Φ(1)2, and Φ(1)3 yield three secondary constraints,

[formula]

The consistency conditions on the constraint functions Φ(2)2, Φ(2)3 imply λ3  =  λ2 = 0. The only Lagrange multiplier remaining unfixed is λ1.

One can separate the constraints into a set of first-class constraints,

[formula]

and a second-class set of constraints,

[formula]

The set of the first class constraints is exactly the one appearing in the theory of scalar massless particles. Only one constraint function depends on the Grassmann-odd variables ηk and it belong to the set of second-class constraints.

In this stage Φ(2)2 is already contained in a set of second-class constraints, that is, without using any gauge condition we get to solve the bifermionic constraint problem [\cite=fggm04].

Gauge fixing

With the aim to use the physical time x0 as evolution parameter, we impose the gauge condition

[formula]

The constraint function ΦG1 depends on τ. In order to obtain a τ-indepent set of constraints we make a canonical transformation [\cite=gt90]. The generating function is

[formula]

so that the relation between the new variables [formula], [formula] and the old ones, [formula], [formula], is given by

[formula]

The constraint function ΦG1 takes the form

[formula]

and the new Hamiltonian is given by

[formula]

The conservation condition for the constraint ΦG1 implies

[formula]

The consistency condition for this constraint yields λ1 = 0. One can replace the set of constraints obtained by the equivalent set Φ,

[formula]

This is a set of second-class constraints as a direct calculation proves.

There are seventeen fundamental variables at this stage and eight constraint equations. Apparently, nine variables should be considered independent and the rest of the varibles can be expressed in terms of the independent ones. However, one of our constraints is quadratic.

Dirac brackets

The nonzero Dirac brackets of the canonical variables with respect to the set of constraints Φ, eq. ([\ref=constraints-final]), are

[formula]

Only the term - p0 in the Hamiltonian H(3) does not vanish on the constraint surface. Then the Hamiltonian

[formula]

can be used instead oh H(3). The evolution of the quotient algebra elements is consitently defined by the Hamiltonian equations. However, the Dirac brackets ([\ref=xpeta]) do not possess canonical form. This was to be exepcted, because the variables pμ are not independent: they are related by the constraint equation Φ5 = 0.

Solutions in the complex algebra

If the pseudoclassical algebra is just a [formula]-module, only two solutions exist for the equation Φ5 = 0, namely,

[formula]

where ζ  =    ±  1 is the energy sign. Putting ζ = 1 one obtains, upon quantization, the quantum mechanics of the spinning massless particles with both signs of helicity. The second solution yields the quantum mechanics of the negative-energy states with both signs of helicity. The chirality h is equal to helicity,

[formula]

and is a conserved quantity. Indeed, its Dirac bracket with the Hamiltonian

[formula]

vanishes.

Quaternionic pseudoclassical mechanics

Since our aim is to reproduce, by strictly canonical methods, the quantum mechanics of the chiral sectors, we assume that the pseudoclassical algebra A is a [formula]-bimodule, where [formula] is the algebra of the biquaternions. Further, we postulate the following relation between the left and right multiplication of the algebra elements by quaternions [formula]. Let {1,J1,J2,J3} be a basis in [formula], such that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

The rest of the generating elements of A, as well as the evolution parameter τ, commute with Jk. These rules are invariant under a change of the basis in [formula]

[formula]

if [formula] ,[formula], [formula] satisfy eq. ([\ref=quaternions]), because the quotient algebras arising when the two bases are used, are isomorphic.

Equation p2 = 0 possesses new solution in the extended algebra, in addition to the solutions ([\ref=energy]). These are

[formula]

where [formula] satisfy ([\ref=quaternions]). The constant χ  =    ±  1 is the (pseudoclassical counterpart) of helicity (multiplied by two). Then

[formula]

Because of the relation postulated ([\ref=leftright]) between the left and the right multiplication by quaternions, the constraint equation Φ8 = 0 is ambiguous without specifying the order of the factors in its right-hand side. Assuming that h stays to the left of p0, one obtains

[formula]

The quantity h is conserved, since its Dirac bracket with the Hamiltonian

[formula]

vanishes.

Quantization

According to Dirac rules, the operators x̂k, p̂k, and k, corresponding to the independent variables xk, pk, and ηk, must satisfy the (anti-)commutation relations

[formula]

Positive- and negative-energy sectors

Let Hxp be a Hilbert space in which an irreducible representation, generated by x̂i, p̂i, of the Heisenberg algebra is given. Let Hη be a unitary space in which an irreducible representation, generated by i, of the Clifford algebra is given. Then in [formula] an irreducible representation of the Lie superalgebra is given. If the solution ([\ref=henergy]) is chosen, then

[formula]

The energy sign operator

[formula]

is a number, and, therefore, it commutes with all the canonical operators. The rest of the dependent operators, [formula] and ê, are expressed in terms of the independent ones,

[formula]

according to eqs. ([\ref=constraints-final]), and the Hamiltonian is given by

[formula]

The Schrödinger equation reads

[formula]

where |φ(x0)〉 is a time-dependent vector in H. An explicit realization is given in the Hilbert space of the (two-component, square-integrable) spinor-valued functions [formula], where one can put

[formula]

σk being the Pauli matrices. Taking the direct sum of two copies of this Hilbert space and putting ζ = 1 for the first copy and ζ =  - 1 for the second, one obtains

[formula]

The Schrödinger equation for this system is the Dirac equation in the Foldy-Wouthuisen form,

[formula]

and the chirality operator [formula] reads

[formula]

It anticommutes with the operators k (and commutes with x̂k, p̂k), while the energy-sign operator [formula] commutes with all the canonical operators.

Chiral sectors

Let [formula] be, where [formula]. In biquaternionic algebra we can define three conjugations, namely

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

These are complex, quaternionic and hermitean conjugations, respectively. With these operations, we can define biquaternionic scalar product as

[formula]

Following [\cite=mori83] we have

[formula]

and also [formula], [formula]. Then we can rewrite the scalar product as

[formula]

The operators [formula], acting in [formula] and defined by

[formula]

satisfy the anticommutation relations ([\ref=anticommutators]) and posses the same commutation properties with Jk as the pseudoclassical variables ηk do. The representation of the Clifford algebra in [formula], generated by these operators is reducible and decomposes into two irreducible representations. The subspace [formula] , spanned on the vectors

[formula]

is one of the invariant subspaces. The representation of the Clifford algebra in [formula], generated by k is irreducible. Let an irreducible representation, generated by xk and pk, of the Heisenberg algebra be given in some complex Hilbert space Hxp. An irreducible representation of the canonical (anti-) commutation relations is defined in the tensor product [formula] in a natural way. The Hamiltonian is given by Ĥ  =  iχJkp̂k, according to eq. ([\ref=hamiltonian5]).

Let [formula] be the basis of the coordinate eigenvectors in Hxp,

[formula]

A basis in H is given by the vectors [formula] (α = 1,2). A state vector |ψ〉 in H is represented in this basis by a two-component wave function ψ,

[formula]

Since

[formula]

the time dependent wave function satisfies the Weyl equation

[formula]
