Introduction

Gas plays a vital role in the evolution of disc galaxies. The collapse of gas produces star formation; stars enrich gas, expel it via winds and supernova explosions and create a circulation called the galactic fountain (e.g. [\cite=sha76]). Outflows of gas from galactic discs with velocities of the order of 100  km  s- 1 are indeed observed both in the neutral ([\cite=kam91]) and the ionised phase ([\cite=fra04]). On the other hand, disc galaxies also seem to acquire a substantial amount of gas from their surroundings. Accretion of unpolluted material from the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) is predicted by chemical evolution models of the Milky Way (e.g. [\cite=roc96]) and the low metallicities of some of the High Velocity Clouds (HVCs) (e.g. [\cite=tri03]) suggest that cold material is indeed accreted by spiral galaxies like our own ([\cite=oor70]).

In recent years, a new and important fact has emerged. Observations at various wavelengths have shown the presence of a considerable amount of gas in the haloes of disc galaxies (extra-planar or halo gas). Deep Hα observations have revealed the presence of extended layers of diffuse ionised gas (DIG) around edge-on spiral galaxies ([\cite=hoo99]). X-ray observations have shown the presence of hot plasma at distances of tens of kpc from the plane of galactic discs (e.g. [\cite=str04]). H  I observations have revealed extended thick layers surrounding the galactic discs ([\cite=swa97] [\cite=fra01] [\cite=mat03]). The origin and the nature of this halo gas are still unknown. However, it is a unique probe to study the exchange of gas within a galaxy and between galaxies and the IGM.

NGC 891

NGC 891 is one of the best known and studied nearby edge-on galaxies. It is at the distance of 9.5 Mpc, classified as a Sb/SBb, and it is often referred to as very similar to the Milky Way (e.g. [\cite=vdk81]).

NGC 891 has been the subject of numerous studies at different wavelengths that have led to the detection of various halo components: an extended radio halo ([\cite=all78]), a thick layer of diffuse ionised gas (DIG) (e.g. [\cite=det90]), and diffuse extra-planar hot gas ([\cite=bre94]). Also "cold" ISM components have been detected in the halo such as H  I ([\cite=swa97]), dust ([\cite=how99]) and CO ([\cite=gar92]).

New H  I observations of NGC 891 have been obtained with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) with a total integration time of about 200 hrs ([\cite=oos05]). Fig. 1 shows the new total H  I map of NGC 891 in contours overlaid on a grey-scale DSS optical image. This H  I halo is remarkably extended with a spur of gas reaching a distance of 15 kpc from the plane. The H  I disc of NGC 891 is lop-sided, more extended on the S-W side of the galaxy (right in Fig. 1) and possibly truncated on the N-E (left) side (see also [\cite=san79]; [\cite=swa97]).

The halo gas in NGC 891 rotates more slowly than the gas in the plane ([\cite=swa97]). This is a common property of gaseous haloes (e.g.  [\cite=fra01] [\cite=hea05a]). Our new data allow us to study the kinematics of the halo gas in detail and derive rotation curves at different heights from the plane ([\cite=fra05a]; Fraternali, in preparation). The measured gradient in rotation velocity is Δvrot  ~   - 15  km  s- 1kpc- 1 for 1.3<  z<  5.2 kpc. This value agrees with the velocity gradient measured in the ionised gas ([\cite=hea05b]).

Halo gas in other disc galaxies

How common are gaseous haloes? Until now, neutral extra-planar gas has been studied in 6 disc galaxies. The H  I data for these galaxies are among the deepest ever obtained and this may indicate that halo gas is a common feature that has escaped detection because of a lack of sensitivity.

Table 1 summarizes the 6 halo gas detections sorted by their FIR luminosity (which is a measure of the star formation rate, SFR). A relation between the amount of halo gas and the SFR may be expected if the halo gas has a galactic fountain origin. It is possible that a trend is indeed present for low luminosity galaxies. Note that the mass of halo gas estimated for NGC 6946 is a lower limit due to the low inclination ([formula]) of the galaxy that does not allow an efficient separation of the halo component ([\cite=boo05b]). However, the starburst galaxy NGC 253 is totally anomalous, having very little extra-planar H  I compared to the other galaxies. This may be an indication that in the most actively star forming galaxies most of the halo gas is ionised.

In addition to these galaxies, there are indications of the presence of halo gas in several others (e.g. NGC 5055, [\cite=bat05]; UGC 1281, Kamphuis et al., this conference; UGC 12632, Oosterloo, private communication) and extra-planar features have been observed in NGC 2613 ([\cite=cha01]). Moreover, it is very likely that this halo gas is analogous to the Intermediate and High Velocity Clouds (IVCs/HVCs) of the Milky Way ([\cite=wak97]) and of external galaxies (M31 and M33, [\cite=wes05]; M83 and M51, [\cite=mil05]).

A dynamical model for extra-planar gas

What is the origin of these gaseous haloes? Some authors have tried to explain them using ballistic galactic fountain models and compared them with Hα observations of ionised gas ([\cite=col02] [\cite=hea05a]). They found a general disagreement between the kinematics and distribution of the halo gas predicted by the models and those shown by the data. Other authors have tried to model the halo gas as a stationary medium in hydrostatic equilibrium ([\cite=ben02] [\cite=barn05]). This approach leads to solutions that can reproduce the observed gradient in the rotation velocity ([\cite=barn05]), however the temperatures of the extra-planar (hydrostatic) gas are of the order of 105 K and it is unclear how this medium can be related to cold neutral gas.

We have developed a model for the formation of the neutral extra-planar gas that takes into account internal and external processes. At the current stage ([\cite=fra05b]) the model tries to reproduce the halo gas as a continuous flow of collision-less particles from the disc into the halo region. The particles are stopped at the passage through the plane. The output of the models are particle-cubes that can be directly compared to the H  I data-cubes. The idea behind this approach is to start from a basic model, study its failures and improve it progressively to match the data more and more closely.

Figure 2 shows three representative channel maps of NGC 891 (left column) compared with those produced by two dynamical models. The two models are for maximum and minimum disc (maximum DM halo) potentials. The channel maps shown here have velocities far from systemic i.e. they show the gas that rotates the fastest. The data show that this gas is mostly located in the disc (the channel maps are thin) whilst the models predict much thicker channel maps, i.e. fast rotating extra-planar gas. This is a failure of the fountain model and this problem cannot be removed by allowing the particles to cross the disc or by considering that they are ionised as they leave the plane and become visible at 21  cm at some point on their orbits (phase change). There is an intrinsic and unavoidable need for low angular momentum material, which suggests that one has to take into account interactions between the fountain flow and a hot gaseous halo and/or accretion material (Fraternali & Binney, in preparation).

Conclusions

The new H  I observations of NGC 891 show the presence of extended neutral gas halo reaching up the distance of 15 kpc from the plane. This halo gas rotates more slowly than the gas in the plane (with a gradient of -  15   km  s- 1kpc- 1). These kinematic properties cannot be explained by an isolated galactic fountain; they require that interactions with a hot halo and/or gas accretion from the IGM must play an important role.
