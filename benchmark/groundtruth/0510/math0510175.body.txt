Strongly Goldie Dimension

Introduction

Throughout this paper rings are associative with identity and all modules are unital right R-modules. For a subset X of a ring R, the left annihilator of X in R is [formula] for all x∈X}. For any a∈R, we write [formula] for [formula]. Right annihilators are defined analogously. N  ≤  essM means N is an essential submodule of M. Let A be a family of modules, we use |A| to denote the cardinality of A. An R-module M has Goldie dimension n (written G.dim M = n) if there is an essential submodule V  ≤  essM that is a direct sum of n uniform submodules. If, on the other hand, no such integer n exists, we write G.dim M =  +   ∞  . We call an R-module M is finite dimensional if G.dim M <  +   ∞  . A ring R is called right finite dimensional if it is finite dimensional as a right R-module. Left dimensional rings can be defined similarly. In this article, strongly Goldie dimension is introduced. An R-module M is with strongly Goldie dimension n (written SG.dim M = n) if Sup{G.dim(M / N) ~ | ~ N  ≤  M} = n. Otherwise, SG.dim M =  +   ∞  . M is called strongly finite dimensional if SG.dim M <  +   ∞  . Properties of strongly finite dimensional modules are explored. As applications, we show that the Faith-Menal conjecture is true if RR is strongly finite dimensional. The Faith-Menal conjecture was raised by Faith and Menal in [\cite=FM94]. It says that every strongly right Johns ring is QF. Recall that a ring R is called QF if it is one-sided noetherian and one-sided self-injective. A ring R is right Johns if R is right noetherian and every right ideal is an annihilator. Right Johns rings were characterized by Johns in [\cite=J77], but he used a false result of Kurshan [\cite=K70] to show that right Johns rings are right artinian. In [\cite=FM92], Faith and Menal gave a counter example to show that right Johns rings need not be right artinian. Later (see [\cite=FM94]) they defined strongly right Johns ring(the matrix ring Mn  ×  n(R) is right Johns for all n  ≥  1) and characterized such rings as right noetherian and left FP-injective rings. But they didn't know whether a strongly right Johns ring is QF.

Characterizations of strongly finite dimensional modules

If a ring R is strongly right finite dimensional, then it is right finite dimensional. But the converse is not true, even if R is a commutative noetherian ring.

For example, let R= [formula], then R is a commutative noetherian ring. But it is not strongly finite dimensional. For every ideal of [formula] is of the form [formula] where [formula] is a product of powers of prime numbers. Write [formula] is a positive integer. Then it is well known that [formula], which implies that G.dim [formula]. Since n is arbitrary, SG.dim [formula].

If N is a quotient module of M, then SG.dim N ≤   SG.dim M.

By definition.

Let 0  →  A  →  B  →  C  →  0 be an exact sequence of modules. Then G.dim B ≤   G.dim A + G.dim C.

Let 0  →  A  →  B  →  C  →  0 be an exact sequence of modules. Then SG.dim  ~  B  ≤  SG.dim ~ A + SG.dim  ~  C.

For any K  ≤  B, by the above lemma, [formula]. Since K is arbitrary, we have SG.dim  ~  B  ≤  SG.dim ~ A + SG.dim ~ C.

SG.dim(A +B)~    ≤    ~   SG.dim A + SG.dim B

Since [formula] is an exact sequence, by the above proposition, SG.dim[formula].

[formula] = [formula].

We only prove for n = 2, the others are similarly. For any quotient module Ki of Mi, i=1,2. It is clear that [formula] is a quotient module of [formula]. Then by definition, [formula]. On the other side, [formula] by the above corollary.

A nonzero module is called uniform if every nonzero submodule is an essential submodule. A module is called uniserial if its submodules are linearly ordered by inclusion. It is obvious that every uniserial module is uniform. But the converse is not true. For example, consider [formula] as a [formula]-module, then [formula] is uniform but not uniserial. A ring R is called right serial if RR is a direct sum of uniserial modules.

If R is right serial, then R is strongly right finite dimensional and SG.dim RR=G.dim RR.

Since there are right artinian rings which are not right serial, strongly finite dimensional rings may not be right serial.

It is obvious that SG.dim M  ≥  1 for every nonzero module M. If SG.dim M = 1, we have

The following are equivalent for an R-module M: (1) SG.dim M = 1. (2) M is uniserial. (3) Every nonzero quotient module of M is uniform.

It is obvious that every quotient module of a uniserial module is also uniserial. So (2)  ⇒  (3)  ⇒  (1). Now we assume (1), if M is not uniserial, then there exists two different submodules A and B of M, neither A  ⊂  B nor B  ⊂  A. Then it is clear that [formula] and [formula] are nonzero submodules of [formula]. Hence there is an inclusion map: [formula], which implies SG.dim M  ≥  2, a contradiction.

A strongly finite dimensional module M may not be noetherian, even if SG.dim M = 1.

For example, let p be a positive prime number. Then [formula] and [formula] is an additive subgroup of [formula] with subgroup [formula]. Denote the factor group [formula] by [formula]. It is clear that every subgroup of [formula] is cyclic and spanned by 1 / pn for some n, which implies that [formula] is a uniserial but not noetherian [formula]-module.

A strongly finite dimensional module M may not be artinian, even if SG.dim M = 1. For example (see [\cite=P01]), let [formula] be the ring of Gaussian's integers, [formula] be its localization at the prime ideal generated by 2 - i, σ be the complex conjugation and R be the skew power series ring [formula], where the multiplication is given by the rule αx = xσ(α). Then R is uniserial but not artinian.

Let M be an R-module and [formula] be a family of proper submodules of M. [formula] is called coindependent (see [\cite=L99]) if for every [formula] and finite subset [formula] [formula] (if I is the empty set, then set [formula]). For SG.dim M = n  ≥  2, we have

The following are equivalent for an R-module M: (1) SG.dimM = n. (2) Sup {|A| ~ | ~ A is a coindependent family of N, where N is any submodule of a quotient module of M} = n

(1)[formula] (2). Assume there exists a nonzero submodule K of a quotient module of M and a coindependent family {Ki,1  ≤  i  ≤  m} of K such that m  ≥  n + 1. Then we have a canonical inclusion [formula] with [formula]. Now we set [formula]. Then by the definition of coindependent family, Ki + Ni = K,1  ≤  i  ≤  m. Thus for each i, f(Ni) is not zero and [formula]. Hence [formula] is a direct sum. Since f is monic, G.dim[formula], which shows that G.dim [formula], a contradiction. (2)[formula] (1). If SG.dim M  >  n, then there exists a nonzero quotient module N of M with a family {Ki,1  ≤  i  ≤  m > n} of independent submodules of N. Now take [formula]. It is clear that {Ni,1  ≤  i  ≤  m} is a coindependent family of [formula], which is a contradiction. So SG.dim M  ≤  n. By hypothesis, there exists a nonzero module A, which is a submodule of a quotient module B of M. And A has a coindependent family {Ai,1  ≤  i  ≤  n} of proper submodules of B. Then by the construction in the proof of (1)[formula] (2), G.dim [formula]. So SG.dim M  ≥   G.dim [formula]G.dim [formula]. Hence SG.dim M = n.

A module M is said to be of finite length (see [\cite=AF92]) if there exists a finite chain of submodules of M: [formula] where Mi - 1 / Mi is simple [formula]. Write c(M) = n for the composition length of M.

If M is a module of finite length and if [formula] is a chain of submodules of M, then there is a composition series for M whose terms include [formula]

[\cite=L98] If M is a module of finite length, then G.dim ~ M  ≤  c(M). G.dim ~ M = c(M) <  +   ∞   if and only if M is semisimple.

If M is a module of finite length, then SG.dim ~ M  ≤  c(M). SG.dim ~ M = c(M) <  +   ∞   if and only if M is semisimple.

For any quotient module N of M, c(N)  ≤  c(M) by Lemma 2.14. Thus by Lemma 2.15, SG.dim M  ≤  c(M). If M is a semisimple module of finite length, then it is easy to get that SG.dim M= c(M) <  +   ∞  . On the converse, if SG.dim M = c(M) <  +   ∞  , then there exists a quotient module N0 of M such that G.dim N0=SG.dim M=c(M). But by Lemma 2.14, c(N0) < c(M) if N0 is not isomorphic to M. Thus N0 must be isomorphic to M and G.dim N0=c(N0). Hence M≃N0 is semisimple by Lemma 2.15.

A ring R is called right semiartinian if every right R-module has an essential right socle.

A ring R is right artinian if and only if R is right semiartinian and strongly right finite dimensional.

If R is right artinian, then it is right semiartinian. Since any right artinian ring is right noetherian, RR is of finite length by [\cite=AF92]. Thus by the above proposition, R is strongly finite dimensional. On the other hand, if R is right semiartinian and strongly right finite dimensional, then every cyclic right R-module is finitely cogenerated. So R is right artinian by Vámous Lemma (see [\cite=NY03]).

From Example 2.12, we see that right semiartinian condition is necessary in the above theorem.

There exists strongly right finite dimensional rings which are not strongly left finite dimensional. Since every one sided artinian ring is left and right semiartinian, by Theorem 2.15, we only need to find right artinian rings which are not left artinian.

Applications

Recall that a ring R is called right F-injective if, for every R-homomorphism from a finitely generated right ideal to RR can be extended from RR to RR. R is called right FP-injective if, for any free right R-module F and any finitely generated R-submodule N of F, every R-homomorphism f:N  →  R can be extended to an R-homomorphism g:F  →  R. It is obvious that right FP-injective rings are right F-injective. But it is still unknown whether a right F-injective ring is right FP-injective. Left F-injective and left FP-injective rings can be defined similarly.

(see [\cite=NY03])A ring R is left F-injective if and only if it satisfies the following conditions: (1) [formula] for all finitely generated left ideals T and T' of R. (2) [formula] for all a∈R.

If R is left F-injective and strongly right finite dimensional, then R is left finite dimensional.

If R is not left finite dimensional, then there exist [formula] such that [formula] is a direct sum. Since R is left F-injective, by the above lemma, for any integers m and any finite subset [formula] , [formula]=[formula]. It is also clear [formula], i  ≠  j. Thus [formula] is a coindependent family of RR. So by Theorem 2.13, SG.dim(RR) =  +   ∞  , a contradiction.

The Faith-Menal conjecture is true if R is strongly right finite dimensional.

Since R is strongly right Johns, R is left FP-injective. So R is left finite dimensional by the above theorem. Thus R is QF by [\cite=FM94].

If R is right F-injective, then R is semilocal if and only if R is right finite dimensional.

If R is semilocal, then by [\cite=L99], RR does not contain an infinite coindependent family of submodules. Then from the proof in Theorem 3.2, we have that R is right dimensional. On the converse, since R is right F-injective, R is right C2 (every right ideal is essential in a direct summand of RR) by [\cite=NY03]. Thus R is semilocal by [\cite=NY03].

If R is right FP-injective or right self-injective, then R is semilocal if and only if R is right finite dimensional.

(see [\cite=NY03])The following are equivalent for a ring R: (1) R is semilocal, right FP-injective, and right Kasch. (2) R is right finite dimensional, right FP-injective, and right Kasch.

A ring R is called right PF if R is a semilocal and right self-injective ring with an essential right socle.

R is right PF if and only R is a right finite dimensional and right self-injective ring with an essential right socle.
