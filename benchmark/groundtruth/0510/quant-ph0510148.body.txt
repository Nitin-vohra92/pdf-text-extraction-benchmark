On Weyl-covariant channels

A noncommutative Fourier transform

A state of finite quantum system is represented by a positive operator ρ of trace one (density operator) in a Hilbert space H of dimensionality d. The set of density operators in H is denoted [formula]. A channel Φ is a completely positive  (CP) trace-preserving (TP) map of the algebra [formula] of all operators in H. Although the TP condition is redundant in the context of our results, we shall impose it just for notational convenience.

The maximal output p-norm of Φ is defined as

[formula]

where [formula] is the Schatten p-norm: [formula].

The current multiplicativity conjecture is that

[formula]

for arbitrary channels Φ and Ω, and for p∈[1,2]. Note that the inequality [formula] is straightforward. In this paper we consider the case p = 2, which is still an open problem (see [\cite=GLR],[\cite=KNR],[\cite=KR2] for some general results in this direction).

Let us choose an orthonormal basis [formula] in H. Consider the additive cyclic group [formula] and define an irreducible projective unitary representation of the group [formula] in H as where x,y∈ [formula] and U and V are the unitary operators such that

The discrete Weyl operators Wz satisfy relations similar to the canonical commutation relations for Weyl operators on [formula] (see e. g. [\cite=H]):

[formula]

where 〈y,x〉: = 2πyx / d.

For future use we introduce the duality form on Z and the symplectic form where J(x,y): = (y, - x).

Instead of the relation [formula] for the usual Weyl operators, we have

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

Consider [formula] as a Hilbert space with the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product. The Weyl operators form an orthogonal basis in [formula]. Hence for all [formula] The correspondence X  ↔  fX(z) is a discrete analog of the noncommutative Fourier transform , see [\cite=H]. It has Parceval-type properties

[formula]

It follows that for a state [formula]

[formula]

and Moreover, ρ is a pure state if and only if [formula], which is equivalent to

[formula]

The relation ([\ref=pr4]) implies

[formula]

A necessary and sufficient condition for a Hermitian [formula]to be positive is: the d2  ×  d2 -matrix is nonnegative definite. The necessity follows from The proof of sufficiency is similar to that for the case of the noncommutative Fourier transform , see [\cite=H].

Multiplicativity for the Weyl-covariant maps and channels

A linear map Φ of [formula] is Weyl-covariant if for all z∈Z and [formula]. Inserting [formula] we find that [formula] satisfies the same relation ([\ref=pr2]) as [formula] hence [formula] commute with all Wz. Therefore

[formula]

where φ(z);z∈Z, is a complex function. By making a normalization, we can always assume that φ(0) = 1. The class of such maps we denote [formula] We shall also use the notation [formula]

Defining the Fourier transform we have for γ = (α,β)∈Z. The relation ([\ref=pr2]) implies that

[formula]

There is a simple formula for composition of two Weyl-covariant maps where [formula] is the convolution of functions p(1)γ,p(2)γ, defining the maps Φ1,Φ2, since the action of the composition on the maps is given by ([\ref=act]), where φ(z) = φ1(z)φ2(z).

The map Φ is channel if and only if {pγ} is probability distribution on Z, and φ(z) - its characteristic function [\cite=H1] . The relation ([\ref=ch1]) is then the Kraus representation.

Our principal estimate is:

Theorem 1. Let [formula]  and [formula] - an operator in [formula]. Then

[formula]

Proof. Defining [formula], we have Note that

[formula]

Next, we have

[formula]

QED

In the case of one dimensional K the bound ([\ref=ineq]) implies the following inequality for channel Φ obtained in proposition 9 of [\cite=KMNR]: Moreover, this proposition states that, in the case d = 3, the equality is attained here for a special pure state ρ. This observation can be substantially generalized (see theorem 3 below).

Theorem 2. Let [formula] be such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

then the multiplicativity of the maximal output 2-norm holds for [formula] where Ω is an arbitrary CP map.

Proof. We have

[formula]

where the last equality follows from [\cite=AH]. Replacing [formula] by [formula] in Theorem 1 and using ([\ref=phi1]) gives

[formula]

Therefore by ([\ref=equ]) QED

Define the set of optimizers of |φ(z)| for z  ≠  0

For a unit vector |ψ〉∈H consider the subset of Z defined as

[formula]

By ([\ref=pr1]) Gψ is a subgroup of Z and |Gψ|  ≤  d as we shall see from the proof of theorem 3.

Theorem 3. Let d be arbitrary. A necessary condition for the equality ([\ref=equ]) is [formula] A sufficient condition is that there is a subgroup Gψ  ⊆  Z such that [formula] and

Proof. If ([\ref=equ]) holds then there exists a pure state ρ such that equality holds in ([\ref=ner]) with Az = fρ(z). This implies [formula]. Hence the necessity follows from ([\ref=cf1]) and ([\ref=cf2]).

Let |ψ〉 be a common eigenvector for the unitaries Wz;z∈Gψ, with eigenvalues cz of modulus 1, and let us show first that [formula]. If [formula], then the operator

[formula]

where [formula]is any subset of [formula] such that [formula] satisfies X|ψ〉 = |ψ〉, and [formula] by ([\ref=par]). This can be only the case if X = ρ0 = |ψ〉〈ψ|. Then it follows: 1) [formula] for otherwise the operator ρ0 would have several different decompositions ([\ref=deco]) corresponding to different subsets L; 2) under the assumptions of the theorem

[formula]

A subset [formula] will be called degenerate if the symplectic form vanishes on F: A subgroup of Z generated by F is again a degenerate subset. Let F be degenerate, then the operators Wz;z∈F, all commute by ([\ref=pr2]) and hence have common eigenvector(s). We conclude that ψ for some ψ, hence [formula] and if the equality holds, then F is a (maximal degenerate) subgroup of Z.

Examples

1) Consider the cyclic subgroup generated by an element z∈Z This subgroup is degenerate and [formula] in the case where z = (α,β) and α,β,d have no common nontrivial divisor, in particular if d is prime.

2) Assume d = p1p2, where p1,p2 are primes, then the subgroup generated by two elements (p1,0) and (0,p2) is a maximal degenerate noncyclic subgroup.

Corollary. If there is a maximal degenerate subgroup [formula] then ([\ref=equ]) holds.

Examples

1) As noticed in [\cite=KMNR], the condition of Theorem 3 always holds if d = 3 and Φ is a channel. By using the fact that 2z0 =  - z0 in case d = 3, our Theorem 2 implies the multiplicativity of 2-norm in case |φ(z)| = |φ( - z)|, e.g. the map Φ is hermitian.

2) Any unital qubit (d = 2) channel is unitarily equivalent to the form where γ = 0,x,y,z and σγ are the Pauli matrices (see e. g. [\cite=KR]). But in the case d = 2 the discrete Weyl operators are Thus any unital qubit channel is covariant with respect to the projective representation of the group [formula] generated by these discrete Weyl operators.

For any z  ≠  0 the cyclic group G(z) consists of two elements {0,z}. Hence the assumption of the corollary is always satisfied for the unital qubit channels. More generally, it holds for arbitrary qubit map [formula]

3) The d - depolarizing channel is unitarily covariant, hence Weyl-covariant. For this channel φ(z) = λ for z  ≠  0, hence [formula] and the assumption of the corollary is trivially satisfied. Moreover, the conclusion holds for the map Φ with arbitrary [formula]

4) Let G be a subgroup of order d and define a function on Z :

[formula]

where a,b are complex numbers to be restricted later. By the Fourier transform,

[formula]

Here [formula] is a subgroup of Z, and we used for a subgroup Γ  ⊆  Z. To see this, for each [formula] choose ∈Z such that 〈γ,〉  ≠  0. Factor Γ by G() of the order, say, N. Then the sum over each coset is 0:

[formula]

A direct calculation shows that the Weyl-covariant map Φ defined by the function ([\ref=phiab]) can be written as

[formula]

where

[formula]

If the group G is maximal degenerate, then [formula]. To see this, take [formula]. This implies [formula] for all (x,y)∈G . Since G is maximal degenerate we have [formula] . The inverse inclusion is obvious. Thus ([\ref=deph0] takes the form

[formula]

Assuming [formula] gives the condition ([\ref=phi1]). Moreover, if a,b satisfy the condition [formula] the map ([\ref=ccom] ) has the property in the corollary, giving another case for which the multiplicativity of 2-norm holds.

If G is maximal cyclic then Ψ is a completely dephasing channel :

[formula]

where [formula] is the orthonormal basis of the commuting operators [formula] as we shall show in a moment. The sum is an expectation onto Abelian subalgebra of operators diagonal in basis {|hk〉}. In this case the condition [formula] becomes redundant. In fact defining the Weyl operators relative to the new basis {|hk〉}, we have the relation ([\ref=deph]), where [formula]. Then [formula], and

[formula]

so that the condition of the corollary is always fulfilled.

Let us show that ([\ref=deph]) is the same as the completely dephasing channel ([\ref=phase]). Let [formula], then we have

[formula]

Let

[formula]

where all αj must be different [formula], for otherwise two different pure states emerging from the corresponding eigenvectors would have the same representations ([\ref=deco]). Hence we can assume that [formula]. Therefore we have

[formula]

Finally consider the case where ([\ref=ccom]) is channel. If the point [formula] is in the triangle, defined by the corners (0,1), ( - 1 / (d - 1),0), (d / (d - 1), - 1 / (d - 1)) (see Figure), the function pγ is nonnegative for all γ and defines the Weyl-covariant channel ([\ref=ch1]). The condition [formula] then amounts to a(a + 2b)  ≥  0 (this corresponds to the shaded area on the Figure). In the case of the channel ([\ref=ccom]) with Ψ given by ([\ref=phase]) it becomes redundant. The multiplicativity of 2-norm in this case follows also from a general result in [\cite=KR2]. To investigate this case further in terms of the additivity of the minimal output entropy and the multiplicativity for p∈[1,  +     ∞ ], see [\cite=F].

Complementary channels

The relation between a channel and its complementary [\cite=H2] (conjugate [\cite=KMNR]) was investigated in these papers to show that the multiplicativity of the original channel implies that of the complementary channel. Suppose the original channel is given by the Kraus representation and the complementary channel by Here [formula] and [formula]. Then [\cite=H2] where {et}t is an orthonormal basis in HB and {ẽα}α in HC.

In this section we compute the complementary of a Weyl-covariant channel. This was also derived in [\cite=KMNR] but we give somewhat more explicit form by using a different method. In this section we use, for convenience, different notations for the Weyl-covariant channel Let et be a row vector with t-th entry 1 and others 0. Then Hence Therefore reordering the Kraus operators we have Here

[formula]

where which is a diagonal matrix defined for each s. Then we have

In general, a channel of the form can be rewritten as Therefore the complementary channel of the Weyl covariant channel can be written as where
