Lattice Points in Large Borel Sets and Successive Minima

Iskander Aliev and Peter M. Gruber

Introduction and Statement of Results

A lattice L in Euclidean d-space [formula] is the system of all integer linear combinations of d linearly independent vectors in [formula]. These vectors form a basis of L and the absolute value of their determinant is the determinant d(L) of L. d(L) is independent of the particular choice of a basis. To each lattice L we let correspond all d  ×  d matrices the column vectors of which form a basis of L. Identify each such matrix with a point in [formula]. There is a Borel set [formula] in [formula] consisting of such matrices, which has infinite Lebesgue measure and such that to each lattice L corresponds precisely one matrix in [formula]. Thus there is a one-to-one correspondence between the space [formula] of all lattices in [formula] and [formula]. The Lebesgue measure on [formula] then yields a measure ν on [formula].

Results of Rogers [\cite=Rogers55] (for d  ≥  3) and Schmidt [\cite=Schmidt60] (for d = 2) show that for a Borel set B in [formula] with Lebesgue measure V(B) =   ∞  , ν-almost all lattices L contain infinitely many primitive points in B, where a point l∈L is primitive if it is different from the origin o and on the line-segment

Proof of Theorem 1

A result of Yao and Yao [\cite=YaoYao85] says that any mass distribution in [formula] with positive, continuous density which tends rapidly to 0 as ||x||  →    ∞  , and of total mass V, can be dissected into 2d disjoint Borel parts, each of mass 2- dV and such that no hyperplane meets all these 2d masses. We need the following version of this result:

To see (2), choose a compact set C  ⊂  A with V(C) > V. This is possible by the inner regularity of Lebesgue measure. Next, choose a continuous function [formula] such that

[formula]

where χC is the characteristic function of C. This is possible by the outer regularity of Lebesgue measure and Urysohn's lemma. Let [formula] be a dissection of [formula] for the density g as described by Yao and Yao such that

[formula]

Then there is no (d - 1)-dimensional subspace of [formula] which meets each of the sets [formula], and for the respective volumes of these sets we have the following estimate:

[formula]

This concludes the proof of (2).

For the proof of Theorem 2 assume first that d  ≥  3. The following result is an immediate consequence of a result of Rogers [\cite=Rogers55], p. 286:

The main step of the proof is to show the following proposition:

To prove this, let [formula] be such that

[formula]

By (2),

Consequently (3) implies that

By (5) and (3) the sets [formula] are Borel. It thus follows from (6) that [formula], or

The set [formula] is Borel and consists of all lattices [formula] such that at least one of the sets Bni contains no primitive point of L. Hence [formula] is the set of all lattices [formula] such that each set Bni contains a primitive point of L. Hence (5) shows that

By (7),

By definition the sets Bn are pairwise disjoint subsets of B. Hence (8) implies that

[formula]

Since by (9),

[formula]

the proof of (4) is complete.

Since [formula], Theorem 1 for d  ≥  3 is an immediate consequence of (4).

Assume now that d = 2 and let ξ be the measure on [formula] used by Schmidt [\cite=Schmidt60], p. 525. A result of Schmidt [\cite=Schmidt60], p. 526/7, shows that (3) continues to hold, but with the following weaker inequality:

[formula]

Using this, we see that in the case d = 2 the proof is, in essence, the same as the above proof for d  ≥  3. Finally, note that the sets of measure 0 with respect to ξ and ν coincide.[formula]

Proof of the Lemma

Let fn and f be the distance functions of Sn and S, respectively. Since distance functions are positively homogeneous of degree 1, and fn  →  f uniformly for ||x||  ≤  1, we have that fn  →  f uniformly on each bounded set in [formula]. This yields the following statement:

The following claims are simple consequences of the convergence Ln  →  L, see [\cite=GruberLekkerkerker87], p. 178/9:

(i): Let ε > 0. By the definition of successive minima one can show that there are linearly independent lattice points [formula] such that

By (11) we may choose points [formula] such that

Since [formula] are linearly independent, it follows that

Hence, by the definition of λi together with (15), (14), (10), and (13) we obtain that

[formula]

Since ε > 0 was arbitrary, this concludes the proof of claim (i).

(ii): Let 0 < ε < 1. Since fn  →  f uniformly on {x:||x|| = 1} and f(x) > 0 for ||x|| = 1 by the boundedness of S, and fn,f all are continuous and positively homogeneous of degree 1, there is a constant α > 0 such that

For such n we have that f(x) > 0 for x  ≠  o, hence Sn is bounded. The definition of λi then yields that

(16), (17), (1) and (i) together imply that

For all sufficiently large n, the vectors [formula] are linearly independent by (17). Consequently, [formula] is an integer multiple of d(L). By assumption, Ln  →  L. Hence d(Ln)  →  d(L). Combining this, it follows that

By (18), all the sequences [formula] are bounded. Fix an index [formula]. By considering a suitable subsequence of [formula] and re-numbering, if necessary, we may suppose that

and [formula] say. By (10), (12) and (19) the latter implies that

In particular, [formula] are linearly independent. Using (17) and the definition of λi, it follows that

[formula]

This together with (20) and (i) finally yields (ii).[formula]

Proof of Theorem 2

[formula](i): Apply Theorem 1 with [formula] to see that for ν-almost all lattices εS contains a d-tuple of linearly independent primitive points of L for any ε > 0. Hence λd(S,L) = 0 for ν-almost all lattices L. In conjunction with (1), this completes the proof of claim (i).

(ii): Let [formula] Since λd(S,    ·    ) is upper semi-continuous by the Lemma, [formula] is closed. If the interior of [formula] is non-empty, then [formula] by the definitions of ν and the topology on [formula], in contradiction to (i). Hence [formula] has empty interior. Being closed, [formula] is nowhere dense in [formula]. Hence

[formula]

Now note (1) to conclude the proof of claim (ii).[formula]
