Local Estimates for Some Fully Nonlinear Elliptic Equations

Let (M,g) be a smooth Riemannian manifold of dimension n  ≥  2. We are interested in a priori estimates for solutions of some classes of fully nonlinear elliptic equations on (M,g). These kinds of equations arise naturally from geometry and other fields of analysis and share structures similar to those of the Monge-Ampere equations.

Regularity problems are studied by people in different fields separately. One would like to ask if it is possible to give a unified proof and to generalize further to a large class of equations. The answer is affirmative provided the equations satisfy some algebraic structures which can induce the cancellation phenomenon. We will see how this phenomenon helps us to get the Hessian bound directly. One of the interesting cases is the Schouten tensor equation arising from conformal geometry:

[formula]

where σk is the kth elementary symmetric function. Local C2 estimates are proved for this equation by Chang, Gursky, and Yang [\cite=CGY02] (k = 2,n = 4) and by P.Guan and G.Wang [\cite=GW03] for all k  ≤  n. The same results with specific dependence on the radius of the domain are established by Gursky and Viaclovsky [\cite=GV05]. P.Guan and G.Wang [\cite=GW04] also prove the local estimates for quotients of the elementary symmetric functions. Other related works in this direction include [\cite=LL03], [\cite=GV03] and [\cite=STW05].

Another interesting case is the following equation in optics geometry:

[formula]

Interior C2 estimates are proved by X.Wang [\cite=Wx96] for n = 2, while local C2 estimates for all n  ≥  2 are by P.Guan and X.Wang [\cite=GWx98].

It turns out that in getting local C2 estimates for nonlinear equations as described above, the coefficient in front of the gradient square term plays an important role. For arbitrary coefficients, in general it is not true that we have local estimates . See [\cite=STW05] for a counterexample.

In the degenerate case, when the gradient square term disappears, one can have maximal principles for second derivatives, which means the Hessian bound over [formula] is less than or equal to that on ∂Ω. Examples are the general Monge-Ampere equations. In particular, the Gauss curvature equation in a domain Ω in [formula]

[formula]

is of this type. Another relevant equation is the Gauss curvature equation for a radial graph in a domain Ω in Sn:

[formula]

Maximal principles for the first equation is studied in Caffarelli, Nirenberg, and Spruck [\cite=CNS-1], and for the latter by B.Guan and J. Spruck [\cite=GbS93]. See also [\cite=gbs02], [\cite=TrWx02] and [\cite=GGb02] for related works.

In this paper, we consider more general operators, which in particular include the equations discussed above. We will derive local C2 estimates directly from C0 bounds and also prove the maximal principles for second derivatives. For the reader who is more interested in the aforementioned equations, he or she can jump directly to Section [\ref=s:ex] where a brief explanation and statements of results about them are given.

Now we turn to the equations we are going to discuss. Let

[formula]

be a (0,2) tensor on a Riemannian manifold (Mn,g). The derivatives are covariant derivatives with respect to the metric g. Consider the equation

[formula]

where F satisfies some fundamental structure conditions listed later and g- 1 is the induced inverse tensor of metric tensor g. Equation ([\ref=e:main]) means that we apply F to the eigenvalues of matrix (or (1,1) tensor) g- 1W. When the manifold is flat (e.g., the Euclidean case), we have gij  =  δij where δij is the Kronecker delta. In this case, we drop g- 1 and simply write [formula]

We now describe the fundamental structure conditions for F. Let Γ be an open convex cone with vertex at the origin satisfying [formula] Suppose that F(λ) is a homogeneous symmetric function of degree one in Γ normalized with [formula] Moreover, F satisfies the following in Γ:

(S0) F is positive.

(S1) F is concave. (i.e., [formula] is negative semi-definite.)

(S2) F is monotone. (i.e., [formula] is positive.)

In some cases, we need an additional condition:

(A) [formula], for some μ0,μ1  >  0.

An easy example is [formula] with [formula] Then [formula] is just the Laplace-Beltrami operator plus some lower order terms, where trg is the trace with respect to g. More interesting examples are discussed in Section [\ref=s:sigma]. Condition (S1) is necessary in most elliptic theories. Condition (S2) is the actual ellipticity. It is an elementary fact that if F is a symmetric function of eigenvalues, then [formula] for all i if and only if [formula] is positive definite. Condition (A) is used previously in [\cite=GWx98]. There is one more key point. In general, we do not have uniform ellipticity for fully nonlinear elliptic equations. This is because Fij involves [formula] whose a priori estimates need to be derived.

A natural question is whether we can consider the tensor in forms other than ([\ref=e:w]). It turns out that for some equations coming from geometry, they can be formulated in the form of ([\ref=e:w]) after a wise choice of the function u(x). We will see in Section [\ref=s:ex] that it is certainly the case for geometric optics equations and Gauss curvature equations on spheres.

Before stating the theorems, we introduce the following notations. Let [formula] and [formula] be two given positive functions. Let [formula] be a solution to ([\ref=e:main]). We define

[formula]

If we restrict x to a local ball Br, we use the corresponding notations cinf(r), csup(r) and esup(r). We also use the convention that a (0,2) tensor Tij  ≥  gij means that T(v,v)  ≥  g(v,v) for all vectors v as a bilinear form.

In the following theorem, cases (a) and (b) show how relations of a(x),b(x) and [formula] give us Hessian estimates directly. However, if we have gradient bounds already, then h is bounded. Case (c) shows more general results.

(Local estimates) Let F satisfy the structure conditions (S0)-(S2) in a corresponding cone Γ and u(x) be a C4 solution to ([\ref=e:main]) in a local geodesic ball Br. Suppose that b(x)  <    -  δ1 and a(x)  +  nb(x)  <    -  δ2.

case(a): h = h0 is a positive constant. Then

[formula]

where [formula] but is independent of cinf(r).

case(b): Suppose [formula] and f = f(x). Let Λ(p) be a positive function such that hpipj  ≥  Λ(p)gij. If there exists some number M  >  0 such that

[formula]

then

[formula]

where [formula]

case(c): Suppose that F satisfies the additional condition (A) and that Γ+2  ⊂  Γ. ( See Section [\ref=s:sigma] for the definition of Γ+2.) Then

[formula]

where [formula], [formula]

An example of case (a) is the Schouten tensor equation arising from conformal geometry; an example of case (b) and (c) is the geometric optics equation.

For the degenerate case b = 0, we do not in general have local estimates. However, if the manifold has enough symmetry, say of constant sectional curvature K, we may consider a special type of equation

[formula]

where a is a constant. Note that when a  =  0 and K = 0 (e.g., Euclidean space), this is the Monge-Ampere type equation.

(Maximum Principle) Let F satisfy the structure conditions (S0)-(S2) in a corresponding cone Γ. Suppose that (M,g) is of nonnegative constant sectional curvature K and that hpipj  ≥  εδij for some positive ε. Let u(x) be a C4 solution to ([\ref=e:csc]) in a bounded domain Ω  ⊂  M. Then

[formula]

where [formula]

Examples of Theorem [\ref=t:max] are the Gauss curvature equations on a domain in Rn and in Sn.

This paper is organized as follows. We start with some background in Section [\ref=s:sigma]. In Section [\ref=s:ex], we discuss applications and give the statements of results. The proofs of Theorems [\ref=t:local] and [\ref=t:max] are in Sections [\ref=s:local] and [\ref=s:max], respectively.

Background

First, we give some basic facts about homogeneous symmetric functions.

Let Γ be an open convex cone with vertex at the origin satisfying [formula] and [formula] be the identity. Suppose that F is a homogeneous symmetric function of degree one normalized with F(e) = 1, and that F is concave in Γ. Then the following are true:

(a) By homogeneity, F(θλ)  =  θF(λ). Let θ be some positive number. Since F is concave in Γ, then

[formula]

Choose some θ  <  1 and some θ  >  1 and cancel out the factor (θ - 1), which gives the result.

(b) Γ contains the identity e and since F is concave in Γ, we have

[formula]

where the equality holds by (a). Cancelling out F(λ), we prove (b).

Now we focus on elementary symmetric functions because most interesting cases are related to them.

Let W be a matrix with eigenvalues [formula] Then [formula] for k  ≤  n is called the kth elementary symmetric function of the eigenvalues of W. We denote σ0  =  1. For examples, [formula] and [formula]

The elementary symmetric functions are examples of hyperbolic polynomials introduced by Garding [\cite=Gar59] ,which have nice properties in the associated cones.

The set Γ+k  =  { the connected component of σk(λ) > 0 which contains the identity } is called the positive k-cone. Equivalently, it is shown in [\cite=Gar59] that for k > 0, Γ+k  =  {λ  :σi(λ) > 0,1  ≤  i  ≤  k} is an open convex cone with vertex at the origin, e.g., [formula] and Γ+n  =  {λ:λi  >  0,1  ≤  i  ≤  n}. We also have the nested relation

[formula]

We say that W∈Γ+k if the eigenvalues λ(W)∈Γ+k.

We list some basic properties of elementary symmetric functions.

(see [\cite=Gar59], [\cite=Mit70] and [\cite=Tr90] for the proof) Let [formula]

(a) G is positive and concave in Γ+k.

(b) G is monotone in Γ+k, i.e., the matrix [formula] is positive definite.

(c) For 1  ≤  m  <  k  ≤  n, we have the Newton-MacLaurin inequality

[formula]

Therefore, [formula] satisfies the structure conditions (S0)-(S2) in Γ+k. We further show that if l  =  0 and k  ≥  2, then [formula] satisfies (A) with [formula] and [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=l:sigma] (c), for 1  ≤  m  ≤  k - 1, we have the recursive formula

[formula]

Then

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

Another useful function, which is also a variant of the elementary symmetric functions, is

[formula]

Suppose t,s  ≥  0 with t + s  ≥  1. Let Γ  =  {λ:tλ  +  sσ1(λ)e∈Γ+k}. Then Γ is an open convex cone with vertex at the origin. Let [formula] It is easy to see that F is a homogeneous symmetric function of degree one. Moreover, it is shown in [\cite=LL03] that F is concave in Γ.

Since we consider equations on manifolds, all derivatives are the covariant derivatives with respect to the metric g. Let u be a function on a manifold. Recall that uij  =  uji. However, when we consider higher order derivatives, we should get some curvature terms if we change the order of differentiations. We denote the Riemannian, Ricci, and scalar curvature by Rijkl,Rij and R, respectively. The following formulae are very useful. We remind the readers that we assume gij(0)  =  δij without loss of generality:

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

Applications

In this section, we will list examples where Theorem [\ref=t:local] and Theorem [\ref=t:max] can be applied. 1. Schouten tensor and conformal geometry Let (M,g) be a smooth compact Riemannian manifold of dimension n  ≥  3. The Schouten tensor of g is defined as

[formula]

Under the conformal change gu  =  e- 2ug, the tensor Agu satisfies

[formula]

We consider the equation (0  ≤  l  <  k  ≤  n)

[formula]

Local estimates are proved by Chang,Gursky, and Yang [\cite=CGY02] (k = 2,l = 0 or 1,n = 4), Guan-Wang [\cite=GW03] (l = 0), and Guan-Wang [\cite=GW04] with the additional assumption (n - k + 1)(n - l + 1)  >  2(n + 1). As a corollary of Theorem [\ref=t:local] (a), we prove local C2 estimates for all 0  ≤  l  <  k  ≤  n with specific dependence on the radius. The following argument is a modification of that in Gursky and Viaclovsky [\cite=GV05] where the case l = 0 is proved.

Let u(x) be a C4 solution to ([\ref=e:quot]) with Agu∈Γ+k in a geodesic ball Br in (M,g), 0  ≤  l  <  k  ≤  n. Suppose that f is positive. Then

[formula]

where C depends on [formula] but does not depend on inf f

In Section [\ref=s:sigma] , we showed that [formula] satisfies the structure conditions (S0)-(S2). Let us check the conditions in Theorem [\ref=t:local] (a). In this case, [formula] and h0  =  1. Therefore, [formula] and B  =  Ag whose C2 norm depends on [formula] Finally,

[formula]

where c depends on [formula] but does not depend on inf f. Hence, we prove the case for r = 1. As for general r, without loss of generality, we may assume the injectivity radius ι is greater or equal to one and r  <  1. Define the mapping

[formula]

where exp  is the exponential map. On B(1), define the metric   =  r- 2E*g and the function ũ(y)  =  u(E(y)) -  ln r. Then ũ satisfies

[formula]

on B1. By the estimates we obtained for r = 1, we get

[formula]

Now by the definitions of E, [formula] and ũ, it is not hard to see [formula] and e- 2ũ  =  r2e- 2u. It remains to verify the conditions on the constant C. Since r  <  1, we have [formula] and [formula]

In [\cite=LL03] and [\cite=GV03], they consider the following equations

[formula]

for f(x,u)  =  f0(x)e- 2u and f(x,u)  =  f0(x)e2u, respectively, with tλ  +  sσ1(λ)g∈Γ+k,t,s  ≥  0 and t + s  ≥  1. The local estimates are derived in [\cite=LL03] and [\cite=GV03] accordingly. We reprove these results as a corollary.

Let f1(x,u)  =  f0(x)e- 2u and f2(x,u)  =  f0(x)e2u. Suppose ui(x) is a C4 solution of the following equations in a geodesic ball Br:

[formula]

for i = 1 or 2 , tλ  +  sσ1(λ)g∈Γ+k,t + s  ≥  1 and t + ns  ≤  c0. Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] but is independent of t,s and inf f0.

The proof is similar to that of Corollary [\ref=c:quot]. Let [formula] so F satisfies (S0)-(S2).

2. Optics Geometry

Let (S2,gc) be the standard 2-sphere. Suppose there is a point source light at the origin with the density function ν(x),x∈S2 and the light reflects according to the geometric optics. Given domains Ω,D  ⊂  S2, we are asked to find a star-shaped surface [formula] whose projection to S2 is Ω such that the light reflected from Σ travels in directions in D with density φ- 1(x),x∈D. This is related to the reflector antenna design problem. Mathematically, it means to find a positive solution v of the fully nonlinear elliptic equation

[formula]

where [formula] and N(x) is the unit vector pointing to x∈S2. (For background and derivation of the equation, see [\cite=WN75], [\cite=Wx96] and [\cite=GWx98].) Let us consider the general equation on Sn:

[formula]

The tensor inside det  is not in the form of ([\ref=e:w]). However, since v is positive, let u =  ln v. The equation becomes

[formula]

where [formula] In [\cite=GWx98], local C2 estimates are proved. As a corollary of Theorem [\ref=t:local](c), we prove the following.

Let   u(x) be a C4 solution to ([\ref=e:optic]) in a geodesic ball   Br with [formula] Then

[formula]

where C depends on [formula] but does not depend on inf ν and inf φ.

In Section [\ref=s:sigma], we showed that [formula] satisfies (S0)-(S2) and (A) with [formula] and [formula] Besides, in our case, [formula] and [formula]

For a special case when φ is a positive constant, we can prove local C2 estimates without using the gradient bound. This is a corollary of Theorem [\ref=t:local](b).

Suppose that φ  =  φ0 is a positive constant. Let u(x) be a C4 solution to ([\ref=e:optic]) in a geodesic ball Br with [formula] Then

[formula]

where C depends on [formula] and inf ν.

Let [formula] and [formula] We only need to check the conditions on h. Choose Λ  =  1 and M  =  1. It is easy to see that they satisfy the required conditions.

3. Convex Hypersurface and Gauss Curvature Equation Given a closed smooth embedded (n - 1)-dimensional submanifold Σ in [formula], we are asked whether there exists a hypersurface of constant Gauss-Kronecker curvature in [formula] with Σ as its boundary. Locally this problem is reduced to some Monge-Ampere type equation. If a hypersurface is locally strictly convex, we can express it as a graph (x,u(x)) for [formula] which satisfies

[formula]

where κ is the Gauss curvature which is positive. In Caffarelli-Nirenberg-Spruck [\cite=CNS-1], this type of Monge-Ampere equation is studied in a strictly convex domain Ω. On the other hand, Guan-Spruck [\cite=GbS93] consider star-shaped regions, i.e., radial graphs over a domain Ω  ⊂  Sn. In this setting, the problem becomes finding a positive solution v(x) of the following equation in Ω  ⊂  Sn:

[formula]

where gc is the standard metric on Sn. Since v(x) is positive, let u(x)  =   ln v(x). The equation becomes

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=e:gauss2]) is in the form of ([\ref=e:csc]) now. It is proved in Guan-Spruck [\cite=GbS93] that the Hessian bound of the solution u(x) to ([\ref=e:gauss2]) over [formula] is less than or equal to that on ∂Ω. Here, as a corollary of Theorem [\ref=t:max], we have the following.

Let u(x) be a C4 solution to ([\ref=e:gauss1]) (or ([\ref=e:gauss2])) in a bounded domain [formula] (or Sn, respectively) with [formula] (or [formula], respectively). Suppose that κ is positive. Then

[formula]

where C depends on [formula] and inf κ.

For equation ([\ref=e:gauss1]), K = a = 0, and for equation ([\ref=e:gauss2]), K  =  a = 1. In both cases, [formula] We only need to check the convexity condition on h. If n = 2, then hpipj  =  2δij. When n > 2,

[formula]

Hence, hpipj  >  εδij with ε depending on [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=t:local]

We always assume gij  =  δij at the point we are evaluating. Let [formula] We will show that Δu is bounded. By the condition Γ  ⊂  Γ+1, we have

[formula]

Since a(x) + nb(x)  <    -  δ2, the Laplacian Δu has lower bound and

[formula]

Therefore, we may assume Δu is positive. Let [formula] where 0  ≤  η  ≤  1 is a cutoff function such that η  =  1 in [formula] and η  =  0 outside Br, and also [formula] and [formula] Without loss of generality, we assume r = 1 since for general r, the proof is similar.

Now by the condition Γ  ⊂  Γ+1 again, we get

[formula]

Hence, L is lower bounded and we only need to get the upper bound of L. Suppose x0 is the maximal point of H. At x0, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

is negative semi-definite where in the second equality we have used ([\ref=e:star1]). Moreover,

[formula]

Using the positivity of Fij and the condition on η, we get

[formula]

Now to compute FijLij, we note that Fij(2aiukukj)  =  Fij(2ajukuki) because Fij is symmetric. Thus, we obtain

[formula]

Changing the order of the covariant differentiations and using ([\ref=i:grad1]) give

[formula]

To compute I, notice that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Changing the order of covariant differentiations again yields

[formula]

Now we replace the terms ukki and ukkl by ([\ref=e:star1]) to get

[formula]

Using ([\ref=i:grad1]) again and the condition on η, we have

[formula]

For II, we use the formula

[formula]

to obtain

[formula]

Combining I and II together, we find that

[formula]

After the cancellations, finally we arrive at

[formula]

Now returning to ([\ref=i:est]) and applying η on both sides produces

[formula]

By the concavity of F and Lemma [\ref=l:sym] (a), we have [formula] Hence,

[formula]

case(a): h is a positive constant. By Lemma [\ref=l:sym] (b), [formula] hence

[formula]

By the condition on b, finally we arrive at

[formula]

This gives [formula] and hence [formula] is bounded for [formula] Now by ([\ref=i:l]), we see [formula] which implies [formula] is bounded. And then [formula] is bounded.

case(b): [formula] and f  =  f(x). First we perform some computations:

[formula]

where we have used the conditions on h. Now changing the order of differentiations of uikk and using ([\ref=e:star1]) to replace ukki give

[formula]

On the other hand, we have

[formula]

Thus returning to ([\ref=i:fh]), we get

[formula]

Applying the conditions b and using Lemma [\ref=l:sym] (b) to obtain

[formula]

This gives [formula] and then H  ≤  C. Therefore, Δu and [formula] are all bounded. case(c): [formula] is bounded and thus h is bounded. This gives

[formula]

We change the order of differentiations of third derivative terms and use ([\ref=e:star1]) to replace ukki:

[formula]

Hence, ([\ref=i:fh]) becomes

[formula]

By (A) and condition on b, we see that

[formula]

Apply (ηF)μ1 on both sides and note that [formula] so we have

[formula]

This gives (ηΔu)(x0)  ≤  C, and consequently Δu is bounded. Once Δu is bounded, to get the Hessian bounds for cases (a) and (b), we simply consider the maximum of the tensor [formula] over the set (x,ξ)∈(B1,Sn). As for case (c), we use the basic fact that if Γ+2  ⊂  Γ, then [formula] for λ∈Γ.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=t:max]

We assume gij  =  δij at the point we are evaluating. Now we start with some computations on curvatures. It is known that the Riemannian curvature has the decomposition

[formula]

where W is the Weyl tensor and A is the Schouten tensor. If g is of constant sectional curvature K, then W is zero, Ric  =  (n - 1)Kg and R  =  n(n - 1)K. Hence we have

[formula]

Let [formula] By Γ  ⊂  Γ+1, we get [formula] Thus Δu is lower bounded and we only need to get the upper bound. Let [formula] We may assume H is large and suppose x0 is the maximal point of H. At x0, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

is negative semi-definite. Using the positivity of Fij ,we get

[formula]

Before computing I and II, we examine carefully the formulae at the end of Section [\ref=s:sigma]:

[formula]

Thus I becomes

[formula]

Now use the formula

[formula]

to get

[formula]

where we have used Fijauikkuj  =  Fijaujkkui because Fij is symmetric. Changing the order of the differentiations of uikk and replacing it by ([\ref=e:star2]) gives

[formula]

For II, we first change the order of differentiations of ukij and then replace uijk by Wij,k  -  auiujk  -  aujuik to get

[formula]

We combine I and II, and note the cancellation. We obtain

[formula]

Replacing uij by Wij  -  auiuj  -  Kgij and using the concavity of F, we get

[formula]

Since we have C1 bounds and nonnegative K, we obtain

[formula]

Changing the order of the differentiations of uikk and replacing it by ([\ref=e:star2]) again, produce

[formula]

Then by the convexity of h, we arrive at

[formula]

This gives [formula] and hence H  <  C. Finally, to get the Hessian bounds, we consider the tensor [formula] over the set (x,ξ)∈(Ω,Sn).
