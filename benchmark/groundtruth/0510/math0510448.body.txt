Abstract: The above named paper has been withdrawn.

A colleague has observed a gap in the proof of isotopy invariance, which can be repaired by reducing the coefficients (which lie in [formula]) of the antisymmetric kanji with chords incident with more than one component modulo [formula].

An analogous issue arises in considering the effect of orientation reversal in the proof of handle-slide invariance, which can be repaired by reducing the coefficients of all of the antisymmetric kanji modulo [formula].

While an invariant of smooth 4-manifolds is obtained by the repaired construction, the corrected construction does not distinguish the smooth structures on the non-diffeomorphic but homeomorphic pairs of Gompf nuclei.

A more subtle approach to restoring invariance, using an action of an extension of [formula], rather than quotienting the coefficient, has been examined, but will also not restore the ability of the invariant constructed to distinguish the Gompf nuclei.
