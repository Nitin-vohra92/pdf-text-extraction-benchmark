Bihamiltonian Systems of Hydrodynamic Type and Reciprocal Transformations

Introduction

Systems of hydrodynamic type are a class of quasilinear evolutionary PDEs of the form

[formula]

Assume that the above system has two conservation laws

[formula]

with a(u)q(u) - p(u)b(u)  ≠  0, then we can perform a change of the independent variables

[formula]

by the following defining relations

[formula]

Such a change of the independent variables is called a reciprocal transformation of the system ([\ref=1-2]). It originates from the study of gas dynamics, see [\cite=RS] and references therein. Under a reciprocal transformation the system ([\ref=1-2]) remains to be a system of hydrodynamic type

[formula]

Here I denotes the n  ×  n unity matrix and the matrix qI - pV is assumed to be nondegenerate.

The system ([\ref=1-2]) is called a Hamiltonian system of hydrodynamic type if it has the representation

[formula]

where J = (Jij) is a Hamiltonian operator of hydrodynamic type

[formula]

the matrix η = (ηij) is nondegenerate and symmetric on certain open subset U of [formula]. Here and henceforth summations over repeated upper and lower indices are assumed. It was proved by Dubrovin and Novikov [\cite=B.Dubrovin3] [\cite=B.Dubrovin4] that J is a Hamiltonian operator if and only if the pseudo-Riemannian metric (ηij) = η- 1 is flat, and Γjsk coincide with the Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection of (ηij). So we can assume that the dependent variables [formula] of the system ([\ref=eqn-1]) are the flat coordinates of the metric (ηij), i.e., ηij(u) are constants and Γjsk = 0. In what follows we will also call a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on [formula], such as the the one given by η = (ηij), a metric.

A natural question is whether under a reciprocal transformation a system of the form ([\ref=eqn-1]) remains to be a Hamiltonian system of hydrodynamic type. In the special case when the reciprocal transformation is linear in x,t, i.e. when a(u),b(u),p(u),q(u) are constants, Tsarev gave an affirmative answer to the above question [\cite=tsarev]. In fact, it was shown by Pavlov [\cite=Pav] that under the linear reciprocal transformation

[formula]

the Hamiltonian system ([\ref=eqn-1]) with Jij  =  ηij∂x is transformed to the following Hamiltonian system of hydrodynamic type:

[formula]

Here the new dependent variables vi and the function [formula] are defined by

[formula]

In the general cases, the above transformation property of a Hamiltonian system of hydrodynamic type no longer holds true as it was shown by Ferapontov and Pavlov in [\cite=FP1]. Although under a reciprocal transformation ([\ref=zh-1]), ([\ref=eqn-51]) the transformed system of ([\ref=eqn-1]) can still be represented as a Hamiltonian system, the transformed Hamiltonian operator becomes nonlocal, it contains terms with integral operator ∂- 1y.

In this paper, we study the properties of a bihamiltonian system of hydrodynamic type under the action of a reciprocal transformation. We show that under a linear reciprocal transformation of the form ([\ref=eqn-4]), a bihamiltonian system (or a hierarchy of bihamiltonian systems) keeps to have a bihamiltonian structure of hydrodynamic type.

The main motivation of this work comes from the program of classification for certain class of bihamiltonian evolutionary PDEs that was initiated by Boris Dubrovin and the second author in [\cite=DZ01]. The dispersionless limits of such evolutionary PDEs are bihamiltonian systems of hydrodynamic type. Typical examples of this class of evolutionary PDEs include the KdV equation and the interpolated Toda lattice equation, their dispersionless limits will be considered in the examples of Sec. [\ref=sec-4]. One of the important problems related to this classification program is whether a bihamiltonian system of this class remains to be bihamiltonian after a linear reciprocal transformation. The present work is a first step toward answering this problem.

The plan of the paper is as follows: We first formulate the main results in Sec. [\ref=sec-2], then give their proofs in Sec. [\ref=sec-3]; in Sec. [\ref=sec-4] we present two examples to illustrate the main results; the last section is a conclusion.

The main results

A bihamiltonian system of hydrodynamic type is a system of the form ([\ref=1-2]) that admits two compatible Hamiltonian structures of hydrodynamic type, i.e., it has the following representation:

[formula]

Here J1,J2 are two Hamiltonian operators of hydrodynamic type

[formula]

The symmetric matrices η = (ηij),g = (gij) have the properties that η is constant and nondegenerate, g is nondegenerate on certain open subset U of [formula], and det (g - λη) does not vanish identically for any constant parameter λ. Compatibility of these two Hamiltonian operators means that any linear combination J2  -  λJ1 also gives a Hamiltonian operator of the same type. Note that we have chosen the flat coordinates [formula] of the metric η as the dependent variables of the above system.

Let us consider the effect of the linear reciprocal transformation ([\ref=eqn-4]) on the bihamiltonian property of the system ([\ref=zh-2]). To this end, we also take into account the flow of translation along x. It is also a bihamiltonian system with respect to the above bihamiltonian structure

[formula]

Here the functions h0,f0 are defined by

[formula]

with ĝij being the components of the metric g under its flat coordinates [formula].

We introduce the new dependent variables [formula] by the relation ([\ref=zh-5]), then the Jacobian is given by

[formula]

Assume that Q is nondegenerate on [formula], denote

[formula]

After the reciprocal transformation ([\ref=eqn-4]), the systems ([\ref=zh-2]) and ([\ref=zh-4]) are transformed to

[formula]

Note that when the transformation ([\ref=eqn-4]) satisfies the condition a = q = 0,b = p = 1, the flows [formula] and [formula] coincide.

Define two metrics [formula] whose components in the local coordinates [formula] are given by the following formulae

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are related by ([\ref=zh-5]).

The metrics  [formula]  are flat, the corresponding Hamiltonian operators [formula] with components

[formula]

are compatible. Here [formula] with [formula] being the Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection of the metric [formula].

In other words, the metrics [formula]  form a flat pencil [\cite=B.Dubrovin2].

The systems ([\ref=zh-7]) is bihamiltonian with respect to the bihamiltonian structure [formula], i.e., it has the representation

[formula]

where the functions [formula] are defined by

[formula]

Now let us assume that there is given another bihamiltonian system

[formula]

we also assume that this flow commutes with the flow given by ([\ref=zh-2]). By using Corollary 4.2 of [\cite=DLZ], we know that the commutativity of these two flows holds true automatically when the bihamiltonian structure J1,J2 is semisimple, i.e. when the characteristic polynomial  det (gij  -  λ  ηij) has pairwise distinct roots.

Under the reciprocal transformation ([\ref=eqn-4]), the system ([\ref=zh-10]) is transformed to the form

[formula]

it is bihamiltonian with respect to the bihamiltonian structure [formula] and has the representation

[formula]

Here the functions [formula] are defined by

[formula]

Associated to a bihamiltonian structure of hydrodynamic type there is usually a hierarchy of bihamiltonian evolutionary PDEs

[formula]

The independent variable x can be viewed as the spatial variable, tj as the time variables, and the flows of the hierarchy mutually commute. From theorems [\ref=th-1], [\ref=th-3] it follows that the class of bihamiltonian hierarchies of systems of hydrodynamic type is invariant with respect to reciprocal transformations of the form ([\ref=eqn-4]).

Proof of the main results

To prove the theorems of the last section, let us first prove some lemmas.

The Christoffel symbols [formula] and [formula], expressed respectively in the local coordinates [formula] and [formula], of the Levi-Civita connections of the metrics [formula] satisfy the following relations

[formula]

where the matrix Q is defined in ([\ref=zh-14]).

Denote by [formula] the covariant derivative along [formula] of the Levi-Civita connection of the metric g. Then from the second Hamiltonian structure of the system ([\ref=zh-2]) we get

[formula]

From these identities and the flatness of the metric g it follows that

[formula]

for any fixed indices 1  ≤  i,j,k  ≤  n. From the first Hamiltonian structure of the system ([\ref=zh-2]) we also have

[formula]

which lead to the identities

[formula]

so by using ([\ref=zh-12]) and ([\ref=zh-14]) we obtain

[formula]

From these relations and the identity [formula] we obtain

[formula]

Substituting these identities into the formula for Γkij we get

[formula]

The lemma is proved.

The metric [formula] is flat.

Denote by [formula] the covariant derivative along [formula] of the Levi-Civita connection of the metric [formula], and by [formula] the curvature tensors of the metric [formula] respectively

[formula]

By using ([\ref=c-5]) and ([\ref=y-4]) we get

[formula]

thus [formula] and we proved the lemma.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th-1] We need to prove that the pair of metrics [formula] and [formula] form a flat pencil, i.e., for any constant λ satisfying [formula], the metric [formula] is flat, and the contravariant components of its Levi-Civita connection coincide with those of [formula] in the local coordinates [formula] (note that they are flat coordinates for the metric [formula]).

In Appendix D of [\cite=B.Dubrovin2], Dubrovin gave a necessary and sufficient condition for a pair of flat metrics to form a flat pencil. To explain this condition, let us first recall some notations that are introduced in [\cite=B.Dubrovin2]. We denote as above by [formula] the Levi-Civita connection of the metric g and by [formula] its contravariant components in the flat coordinates [formula] of the metric η. We also denote

[formula]

Then the necessary and sufficient condition for the pair of metrics η,g to form a flat pencil is the existence of a vector field [formula], such that the identities

[formula]

hold true for certain constant symmetric tensor cij, and

[formula]

where Δijk  =  ηksΔsij.

The pair of metrics η,g related to the theorem form a flat pencil, we are to use this fact to prove that the pair of metrics [formula] also fulfils the above condition. By using the flat coordinates [formula] of the metric [formula] we introduce the following notations that are similar to those given in ([\ref=zh-15]):

[formula]

Here [formula] denotes the Levi-Civita connection of the metric [formula] and [formula] denote the contravariant components of the connection. From ([\ref=c-6]), ([\ref=zh-17]) it follows that

[formula]

By using the definition ([\ref=zh-14]) of Q we get

[formula]

Then from ([\ref=y-4]), the first formula of ([\ref=e-2]) and the definition ([\ref=zh-9]) we get

[formula]

thus by using ([\ref=zh-14]) and ([\ref=zh-18]) we obtain

[formula]

Similarly, from ([\ref=y-4]) and the second formula of ([\ref=e-2]) we have

[formula]

and consequently

[formula]

Thus we arrive at the identities

[formula]

which implies the existence of a vector field [formula] such that

[formula]

So by using ([\ref=zh-18]), ([\ref=e-3]) and the last formulae we obtain

[formula]

Now we are only left to prove the analogue of ([\ref=zh-19]) for the metrics [formula]. From ([\ref=e-2-a]), ([\ref=e-2]), ([\ref=e-3]) and ([\ref=e-4]) we have

[formula]

They yield

[formula]

Finally, by using ([\ref=e-2-a]), ([\ref=e-2]), ([\ref=e-3]) and ([\ref=e-4]) we obtain

[formula]

Thus the theorem is proved.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th-3] Let us first prove the existence of the functions [formula] that satisfy the equations ([\ref=zh-22]). From the commutativity condition of the flows [formula]

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

where the matrices V,A are defined respectively in ([\ref=zh-2]), ([\ref=zh-10]). By using the first Hamiltonian structure of the system ([\ref=zh-10]) we obtain

[formula]

together with the identities given in ([\ref=e-2-a]) they lead to

[formula]

These identities imply the existence of the function [formula] that satisfies the first equation of ([\ref=zh-22]). To prove the existence of the function [formula], let us use the second Hamiltonian structure of the system ([\ref=zh-10]) to obtain

[formula]

By using ([\ref=e-2-a]) and ([\ref=y-3]) we have

[formula]

Thus from the identity ([\ref=id-2]) and the formula

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

So we arrive at the identities

[formula]

which imply the existence of a function [formula] that satisfies the second equation of ([\ref=zh-22]).

Now by using ([\ref=zh-22]) and ([\ref=y-4]) we have

[formula]

It follows that the system ([\ref=zh-24]) can be represented in the form

[formula]

Similarly, one can show that the system ([\ref=zh-24]) also has the expression

[formula]

thus it is bihamiltonian and the Theorem is proved.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-1] For the system ([\ref=zh-7]) we have

[formula]

The theorem follows immediately from this formula and Theorem [\ref=th-3].

Two examples

We now give two examples to illustrate the above results.

For a given positive integer m, consider the system

[formula]

It is the (m + 1)-th flow of the dispersionless KdV hierarchy, and has the following bihamiltonian structure

[formula]

where

[formula]

Consider the simplest linear reciprocal transformation

[formula]

We introduce the new dependent variable v as in ([\ref=zh-5]) by v = um + 1. Then after the above reciprocal transformation ([\ref=k-1]) is converted to the form

[formula]

By using Theorem [\ref=th-1], [\ref=thm-1], we know that ([\ref=tr-1]) is also a bihamiltonian system

[formula]

Let us consider the (k + 1)-th flow of the dispersionless KdV hierarchy

[formula]

which is also a bihamiltonian system

[formula]

Under the reciprocal transformation ([\ref=re-1]) it is transformed to the following bihamiltonian system:

[formula]

where

[formula]

Consider the long wave limit (also called dispersionless limit)

[formula]

of the interpolated Toda equation[\cite=CDZ] [\cite=B.Dubrovin2]

[formula]

It has the following bihamiltonian representation

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let us perform the reciprocal transformation ([\ref=re-1]) and define the new dependent variables [formula] according to ([\ref=zh-5])

[formula]

Then ([\ref=zh-21]) is transformed to the following equation:

[formula]

By using Theorem [\ref=th-1] and Theorem [\ref=thm-1] we know that it is bihamiltonian where

[formula]

Now we consider the flow

[formula]

which belongs to the dispersionless Toda hierarchy[\cite=CDZ]. It has the bihamiltonian structure with

[formula]

After reciprocal transformation ([\ref=re-1]) it is transformed to

[formula]

By using Theorem [\ref=th-3], we know that the above system is also bihamiltonian where

[formula]

Conclusion

We have considered the effect of a linear reciprocal transformation on the bihamiltonian structure of a bihamiltonian system of hydrodynamic type. In the case when the bihamiltonian structure is related to a Frobenius manifold, there are some special linear reciprocal transformations that correspond to the Legendre transformations between Frobenius manifolds. Such transformations were introduced and studied by Boris Dubrovin in the setting of Frobenius manifold theory [\cite=B.Dubrovin2]. The bihamiltonian structure and the reciprocal transformation that are considered in Example [\ref=exm-zh2] just belong to this case.

As we mentioned in the introduction, we are interested in the problem of whether a more general class of bihamiltonian systems remain to be bihamiltonian after certain linear reciprocal transformations. Such bihamiltonian systems are the objects of study of the classification program that was initiated in [\cite=DZ01], their dispersionless limits are bihamiltonian systems of hydrodynamic type. A positive answer to this problem was given in [\cite=CDZ] for the example of the extended Toda lattice hierarchy, a hierarchy of bihamiltonian evolutionary PDEs. It was shown there that after certain linear reciprocal transformation this hierarchy is transformed to the extended nonlinear Schrödinger hierarchy which is also bihamiltonian. Results regarding the general case for this problem will appear in [\cite=DZ05] and other publications.
