On the "Zero-Two" Law for Positive Contractions on Banach-Kantorovich Lattice [formula]

Introduction

In [\cite=W] some properties of the convergence of Banach-valued martingales was described and there connections with the geometrical properties of Banach spaces was established too. In accordance with the development of the theory of Banach-Kantorovich spaces (see [\cite=KVP],[\cite=K1], [\cite=K2], [\cite=G1], [\cite=G2]) one naturally arises a necessity to study some ergodic properties of positive contractions and martingales defined on these Banach-Kantorovich spaces. In [\cite=CG] an analog of individual ergodic theorem for positive contractions of [formula] - Banach-Kantorovich space has been established. In [\cite=Ga3] the convergence of martingales on such spaces was proved.

Let (X,Σ,μ) be a measure space and let Lp(X,μ), (1  ≤  p  ≤    ∞  ) be the usual real Lp-space. A linear operator T:Lp(X,μ)  →  Lp(X,μ) is called positive contraction if for every x∈Lp(X,μ),x  ≥  0 we have Tx  ≥  0 and [formula].

In [\cite=OS] Ornstein and Sucheston proved that for any positive contraction T on an L1-space, either [formula] for all n or [formula]. An extension of this result to positive operators on L∞-spaces was given by Foguel [\cite=F]. In [\cite=Z1],[\cite=Z2] Zahoropol generalized these results, called "zero-two" laws, his result can be formulated as follows:

Theorem A. Let T be a positive contraction of Lp(X,μ), p > 1,p  ≠  2. If for some [formula] the relation [formula] is valid, then

[formula]

In [\cite=KT] this result was generalized for the Köthe spaces.

In the present paper we will prove the "zero-two" law for positive contractions of lattices [formula] of Banach-Kantorovich, constructed by the measure μ with values in the ring of all measurable functions.

Preliminaries

Let (Ω,Σ,λ) be a measurable space with finite measure, L0(Ω) be the algebra of all measurable functions on Ω ( here the functions equal a.e. are identified) and let [formula] be the Boolean algebra of all idempotents in L0(Ω). By [formula] we denote an arbitrary complete Boolean subalgebra of [formula].

A mapping [formula] is called a L0(Ω)-valued measure if the following conditions are satisfied 1) μ(e)  ≥  0 for all [formula]; 2) [formula], if [formula]; 3) if [formula], then [formula].

A L0(Ω)-valued measure is called strictly positive if [formula] implies e = 0.

In the sequel we will consider strictly positive L0(Ω)-valued measure μ with the following property μ(ge) = gμ(e) for all [formula] and [formula].

By [formula] we denote an extremal completely non-connected compact, corresponding to a Boolean algebra [formula], and by [formula] it is denoted an algebra of all continuous functions on [formula], which take the values ±    ∞   on no-where dense sets in [formula] [\cite=S]. It is clear that L0(Ω) is a subalgebra of [formula].

Following [\cite=B],[\cite=S] the known scheme of construction of Lp-spaces, it can be defined a space [formula] as follows

[formula]

here μ is a L0(Ω)-valued measure on [formula].

Let E be a linear space over the real field [formula]. By [formula] we denote a L0(Ω)-valued norm on E. Then the pair [formula] is called a lattice-normed space (LNS) over L0(Ω). An LNS E is said to be d-decomposable if for every x∈E and decomposition [formula] with f and g disjoint positive elements in L0(Ω) there exist y,z∈E such that x = y + z and [formula], [formula].

Suppose that [formula] is an LNS over L0(Ω). A net {xα} of elements of E is said to be (bo)-converging to x∈E (in this case we write x = (bo)-lim xα), if the net [formula] (o)-converges to zero in L0(Ω) (written as (o)-[formula]). A net {xα}α∈A is called (bo)-fundamental if (xα - xβ)(α,β)∈A  ×  A (bo)-converges to zero.

An LNS in which every (bo)-fundamental net (bo)-converges is called (bo)-complete. A Banach-Kantorovich space (BKS) over L0(Ω) is a (bo)-complete d-decomposable LNS over L0(Ω). It is well known [\cite=K1],[\cite=K2] that every BKS E over L0(Ω) admits an L0(Ω)-module structure such that [formula] for every x∈E, f∈L0(Ω), where |f| is the modulus of a function f∈L0(Ω).

It is known [\cite=K1] that [formula] is a BKS over L0(Ω) with respect to L0(Ω)-valued norm [formula]. Moreover, [formula] is a module over L0(Ω).

It is natural that these [formula] spaces should have many of analogical properties of the classical Lp-spaces, constructed by real valued measures. The proofs of such properties can be realized by using one of the following methods:

1. Step by step repeating all steps of the known proofs of classical Lp-spaces, accounting specially properties of L0(Ω)-valued measures.

2. Using Boolean-valued analysis, which gives a possibility to reduce L0(Ω)-modulus [formula] to the classical Lp-spaces, in the corresponding set theory.

3. Representation of [formula] as a measurable bundle of classical Lp-spaces.

The first methods really is not effective, since it has to repeat all known steps of the proofs modifying them to L0(Ω)-valued measures. The second one connected with the use of drawing an enough labour-intensive apparatus of Boolean-valued analysis and its realization requires a huge preparatory work, which connects with an establishing of intercommunications in ordinary and Boolean-valued methods for studied objects of the set theory.

More natural way to investigate the properties of [formula] is the using of the third method. Since, one has a sufficiently well explored theory of measurable decompositions of Banach lattices [\cite=G1]. Therefore, its an effective using gives a possibility to obtain various properties of BKS[\cite=Ga1],[\cite=Ga2].

Let (Ω,Σ,μ) be the same as above and let X be a assisting a real Banach space X(ω) to each point ω∈Ω. A section of X is a function u defined λ-almost everywhere in Ω that takes values u(ω)∈X(ω) for all ω in the domain dom(u) of u.

Let L be a set of sections. The pair (X,L) is called a measurable Banach bundle over Ω if

λ1u1  +  λ2u2∈L for every [formula] and u1,u2∈L,where [formula];

the function [formula] is measurable for every u∈L;

the set {u(ω):u∈L,ω∈dom(u)} is dense in X(ω) for every ω∈Ω.

A section s is called step-section if it has the form

[formula]

for some ui∈L, Ai∈Σ, [formula], i  ≠  j, [formula], [formula], where χA is the indicator of a set A. A section u is called measurable if for every A∈Σ with λ(A) <   ∞   there exists a sequence of step-functions {sn} such that sn(ω)  →  u(ω) λ-almost everywhere on A.

Denote by M(Ω,X) the set all measurable sections, and by L0(Ω,X) the factor space of M(Ω,X) over the equivalence relation of equality a.e. Clearly, L0(Ω,X) is an L0(Ω)-module. We denote the equivalence class of an element u∈M(Ω,X) by û. The norm of û∈L0(Ω,X) is defined as a class of equivalence containing the function [formula], i.e. [formula].

In [\cite=G1] it was proved that L0(Ω,X) is a BKS over L0(Ω). Furthermore, for every BKS E over L0(Ω) there exists a measurable Banach bundle (X,L) over Ω such that E is isomorphic to L0(Ω).

Put

[formula]

[formula]

where L∞(Ω) is the set all bounded measurable functions on Ω.

In the spaces L∞(Ω,X) and L∞(Ω,X) it can be defined real-valued norms as follows [formula] and [formula], respectively.

A BKS [formula] is called a Banach-Kantorovich lattice if U is a vector lattice and the norm [formula] is monotone, i.e. |u1|  ≤  |u2| implies [formula]. It is known [\cite=K1] that the cone U+ of positive elements is (bo)-closed. Note the space [formula] is a Banach-Kantorovich lattice [\cite=K1].

Let X be a mapping assisting an Lp-space constructed by real-valued measure μø, i.e. [formula] to each point ω∈Ω and let

[formula]

be a set of sections. It is known [\cite=Ga2] that the pair (X,L) is a measurable bundle of Banach lattices and L0(Ω,X) is modulo ordered isomorphic to [formula].

Let p be a lifting in L∞(Ω) (see [\cite=G1]). Let as before [formula] be an arbitrary complete Boolean subalgebra of [formula] and let μ be an L0(Ω)-valued measure on [formula]. The set of all essentially bounded functions w.r.t. μ from [formula] is denoted by [formula].

It is known [\cite=CG] that there exists a mapping [formula], which satisfies the following conditions:

[formula] for all û such that dom(û) = Ω;

[formula];

[formula] for every [formula];

[formula] for every [formula];

[formula] whenever   ≥  0;

the set [formula] is dense in X(ω) for all ω∈Ω;

[formula] for every [formula].

The mapping [formula] is called a vector-valued lifting on [formula] associated with the lifting p (cp. [\cite=G1]).

Let as before p  ≥  1 and [formula] be a Banach-Kantorovich lattice, and let [formula] be the corresponding Lp-spaces constructed by real valued measures. Let [formula] be a linear mapping. As usually we will say that T is positive if T  ≥  0 for every   ≥  0.

Suppose that T is a L0(Ω)-bounded mapping, namely, there exists a function k∈L0(Ω) such that |T|p  ≤  k||p for all [formula]. In this case we can define an element of L0(Ω) as follows

[formula]

which is called an L0(Ω)-valued norm of T. If [formula] then a mapping T is said to be a contraction.

Now we give an example of nontrivial contraction.

Example. Let [formula] be a measurable space with finite measure and let [formula] be a right Boolean subalgebra of [formula]. λ0 denotes the restriction of λ onto [formula]. Now let [formula] be a conditional expectation from [formula] onto [formula]. It is clear that [formula] is a strictly positive [formula]-valued measure on [formula].

Let [formula] be another arbitrary right Boolean subalgebra of [formula] such that [formula]. By μ1 we denote the restriction of μ onto [formula]. According to Theorem 4.2.9[\cite=K1] there exists an conditional expectation [formula] such that it is positive and maps [formula] onto [formula] for all p > 1. Moreover, |T|p  ≤  ||p for every [formula] and [formula].

In the sequel we will need the following

Theorem 2.1. Let [formula] be a positive linear contraction such that [formula]. Then for every ω∈Ω there exists a positive contraction [formula] such that Tωf(ω)  =  (T)(ω) λ-a.s. for every [formula].

Proof. The positivity of T implies that [formula] for every [formula], i.e. the operator T maps from [formula] to [formula] and it is continuous in norm [formula], where [formula]. It is easy to see that for [formula] we have |T|p∈L∞(Ω) and ||p∈L∞(Ω). Define a linear operator φ(ω) from [formula] to [formula] as follows

[formula]

where [formula] is the vector-valued lifting in [formula] associated with the lifting p. From |T|p  ≤  ||p we obtain

[formula]

which implies that the operator φ(ω) is correct defined and it is bounded. Using the fact that [formula] is dense in [formula] we can extend φ(ω) to a continuous linear operator on [formula]. This extension is denoted by Tω.

Show that Tω is positive. Indeed, let [formula] and f(ω)  ≥  0. Then there exists a sequence [formula] such that [formula] in norm of [formula]. Consider [formula]. Then ĝn  ≥  0, and according to the properties of the vector-valued lifting [formula] we infer

[formula]

in norm of [formula]. Whence

[formula]

this means Tωf(ω)  ≥  0. It is clear that [formula] and Tωf(ω)  =  (T)(ω) a.s. for every [formula], here [formula] is the norm of operator from [formula] to [formula].

Now let [formula]. Since [formula] is (bo)-dense in [formula], then there is a sequence [formula] such that |n  -  |p  →  (o)0. Then [formula] for almost all ω. The equality [formula] implies that

[formula]

this means that [formula] a.s. On the other hand the continuety of Tω yields that [formula] a.s. Hence for every [formula] we have (T)(ω)  =  Tωf(ω) a.s. This completes the proof.

Main Results

In this section we will prove an analog of Theorem A formulated in the introduction.

Before proving main result we give some useful assertions.

Proposition 3.1. Let [formula], i = 1,2 be positive linear contractions such that [formula]. Then

[formula]

here as before [formula] is the norm of operator from [formula] to [formula].

Proof. According to Theorem 2.1 we have T(i)ωf(ω)  =  (T(i))(ω), i = 1,2 a.e. for every ∈Lp(,). Using this fact we get

[formula]

this implies

[formula]

By similar reasoning we obtain

[formula]

which yields

[formula]

This inequality with (1) implies the required equality. This competes the proof.

Proposition 3.2. Let [formula], i = 1,2 be positive linear contractions such that [formula]. Then

[formula]

here |  ·  | means the modulus of an operator.

Proof. Using the formula

[formula]

where A:E  →  E is a linear operator and E is a vector lattice (see [\cite=V], p.231), we have

[formula]

for every [formula].

Let |ĝ|  ≤  ||, where [formula], then |g(ω)|  ≤  |f(ω)|. This implies

[formula]

Now using the formula

[formula]

where A is as above and x  ≥  0 (see [\cite=V], p.231) we get

[formula]

Then the monotonicity of the norm [formula] implies

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

The next theorem is an analog of theorem in [\cite=Z2] for positive contractions of [formula].

Theorem 3.3. Let [formula], be a positive linear contraction such that [formula]. If for some [formula] the relation [formula] is valid. Then

[formula]

Proof. According to Theorem 2.1 there exist positive contractions [formula] such that (T)(ω) = Tø(f(ω)) a.e. From Proposition 3.1 we get [formula] a.e. The condition of theorem implies [formula] a.e. Hence the contractions Tø are satisfy the condition of Theorem 1.1. [\cite=OS] a.e., therefore

[formula]

As [formula] a.e. we obtain that

[formula]

therefore

[formula]

The theorem is proved.

Now we can prove the following theorem, which is an analog of Theorem A for the Banach-Kantorovich lattice [formula].

Theorem 3.4. Let [formula], p > 1,p  ≠  2 be a positive linear contraction such that [formula]. If for some [formula] the relation [formula] is vaild. Then

[formula]

The proof uses the similar argument as Theorem 3.3, here instead of Proposition 3.1 it should be used Proposition 3.2.
