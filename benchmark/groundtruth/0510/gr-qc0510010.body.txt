Introduction

Gravity is one kind of fundamental interactions which is known by human beings in very ancient times. In Newton's classical theory of gravity, gravity obeys the inverse square law and the magnitude of gravity is proportional to the mass of the object[\cite=n01]. In Einstein's general theory of gravity, gravity is treated as space-time geometry[\cite=n02] [\cite=n03]. In both Newton's classical theory of gravity and Einstein's general relativity, gravitational field is generated by energy-momentum of matter field, and there is no other way that can directly convert energy of electromagnetic field into energy of gravitational field.

Quantum Gauge Theory of Gravity(QGTG) is first proposed in 2001[\cite=w01] [\cite=w02] [\cite=w03] [\cite=w04]. It is a quantum theory of gravity proposed in the framework of quantum gauge field theory. An important breakthrough on QGTG is obtained in 2003, when Quantum Gauge General Relativity(QGGR) is proposed in the framework of quantum gauge theory of gravity[\cite=w05] [\cite=w06]. In QGGR, the field equation of gravitational gauge field is just Einstein's field equation, so in classical level, we can set up its geometrical formulation[\cite=w061], and QGGR returns to Einstein's general relativity in classical level. In QGGR, the equation of motion of a mass point in gravitational field is given by Newton's second law of motion, which is equivalent to the geodesic equation in general relativity[\cite=w07] [\cite=w08]. For classical tests of gravity, QGGR gives out the same theoretical predictions as those of general relativity[\cite=w08].

In quantum level, QGTG is a perturbatively renormalizable quantum theory, so based on it, quantum effects of gravity and gravitational interactions of some basic fields[\cite=w09] [\cite=w10] can be explored. In QGTG, unifications of fundamental interactions including gravity can be fulfilled in a simple and beautiful way[\cite=w11] [\cite=w12] [\cite=w13]. Gravitational phase effects found in COW experiments[\cite=a01] [\cite=a02] [\cite=a03] and gravitationally bound quantized states found recently[\cite=a04] [\cite=a05] can be understood in a natural way[\cite=w14]. Besides, QGTG possibly solved the cosmological constant problems[\cite=w15], and predicts the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect[\cite=w14]. In the surface of a neutron star or near black hole, the gravitomagnetic field is relatively strong, and measuring the position of the spectral line of the radiation or absorption induced by gravitomagnetic field can help us to determine the strength of the gravitomagnetic field in the surface of the star[\cite=w16]. If we use the mass generation mechanism which is proposed in literature [\cite=w17], we can propose a new theory on gravity which contains massive graviton and the introduction of massive graviton does not affect the strict local gravitational gauge symmetry of the theory and does not affect the traditional long-range gravitational force[\cite=w18]. The existence of massive graviton will help us to understand the possible origin of dark energy and dark matter in the Universe.

There is another important quantum effect of gravitational interactions, the gravitational shielding effect found by Podkletnov[\cite=a06] [\cite=a07]. This effect originates from the interactions between gravitational field and non-homogeneous vacuum, which make gravitational field obtain a small mass term[\cite=w19]. In 2001, Podkletnov found that discharges originating from a superconducting ceramic electrode are accompanied by the emission of gravitational impulse[\cite=a08] [\cite=a09]. Gravity impulse can not be understood in Einstein's general relativity. For a long time, its mechanism is unknown. Some people think that the phenomenon of gravity impulse is not consistent with Einstein's general relativity, and therefore the results is not true. Some even doubt the reality of the experiments. In this paper, based on the unified theory of gravitational interactions and electromagnetic interactions, a new mechanism of the generation of gravitational field is studied. This mechanism can be used to explain the gravity impulse found by E.Podkletnov.

GU(1) Unification Theory

In QGTG[\cite=w01] [\cite=w02] [\cite=w03] [\cite=w04] [\cite=w05] [\cite=w06], the most fundamental quantity is gravitational gauge field Cμ(x), which is the gauge potential corresponding to gravitational gauge symmetry. Gauge field Cμ(x) is a vector in the gravitational Lie algebra, which can be expanded as

[formula]

where Cαμ(x) is the component field and [formula] is the generator of the global gravitational gauge group. The gravitational gauge covariant derivative is given by

[formula]

where g is the gravitational coupling constant and matrix G is defined by

[formula]

Its inverse matrix is denoted as G- 1

[formula]

Using matrix G, G- 1 and Minkowski metric η, we can define two important composite operators

[formula]

[formula]

which are widely used in QGTG. In QGTG, space-time is always flat and space-time metric is always the Minkowski metric, so gαβ and gαβ are no longer space-time metric. They are only two composite operators which consist of gravitational gauge field.

The field strength of gravitational gauge field is defined by

[formula]

Its explicit expression is

[formula]

Fμν is also a vector in gravitational Lie algebra,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Using matrix G, its expression can be written in a simpler form

[formula]

In the unified theory of gravitational interactions and electromagnetic interactions, the lagrangian of theory is selected to be[\cite=w11] [\cite=w06]:

[formula]

where Aμ is the electromagnetic field, and

[formula]

is the gravitational gauge covariant field strength of electromagnetic field. This system has GU(1) gauge symmetry[\cite=w11].

Field Equation of Electromagnetic Field in Gravitational Field

Euler-Lagrangian equation gives out the following field equation of electromagnetic field

[formula]

where Jμ is the electric current of Dirac field

[formula]

The generalized Bianchi identity for electromagnetic field is

[formula]

The above two equations ([\ref=3.1]) and ([\ref=3.4]) are strict relations. Now, let's consider their approximations in the limit of weak gravitational gauge field. Supposed that gravitational field gCαμ is a first order infinitesimal quantity, then in first order approximation, equation ([\ref=3.1]) gives out the following two equations

[formula]

[formula]

and the Bianchi identity ([\ref=3.4]) gives out the following two equations

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula] and [formula] are the gravitoelectric field and gravitomagnetic field respectively, and [formula] and [formula] are the electromagnetic electric field and magnetic field respectively. If gravitational field vanishes, the above equations ([\ref=3.5]) - ([\ref=3.8]) return to the Maxwell equations. Equations ([\ref=3.5]) and ([\ref=3.6]) can be further changed into

Mechanism of Gravity Impulse

It is known that superconductor is a perfect diamagnet. Inside the superconductor, electromagnetic electric field and magnetic field vanish, but in most general case, the electromagnetic gauge potential Aμ does not vanish. Because, inside the superconductor, electromagnetic electric field [formula] vanish, in leading order approximation, we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the scalar potential. In this case, the four equations ([\ref=3.15]), ([\ref=3.16]), ([\ref=3.7]) and ([\ref=3.8]) are simplified to

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the electric charge density. From equation ([\ref=4.4]), we could see that, when there is non-vanishing electric current inside the superconductor, the gravitoelectric field [formula] and gravitomagnetic field [formula] can not both vanish, otherwise equation ([\ref=4.4]) will be violated.

Selecting the following coordinate system: x - y plane is in the surface of the superconducting ceramic disk, and z axis is perpendicular to the surface of the emitter and pointing to the anode. During discharges, gravitomagnetic field [formula] vanishes. Then equation ([\ref=4.4]) is simplified to

[formula]

In the above equation, the dominant term in the left hand side is [formula], we should have

[formula]

So, we have

[formula]

Before discharges, the electric scalar potential φ of the emitter is negative, and after discharges, it vanishes. Therefore during discharges, [formula] is positive

[formula]

From above equation, we know that [formula] and [formula] have the same direction. The direction of electric current is along the minus z axis, so [formula] is along z axis.

[formula] is the gravitoelectric field. When a mass point is in this gravitational field, it feels the following gravitational force

[formula]

where m is the mass of the mass point. And this force is just along the z direction. This just explains what observed in the experiments: the radiation emitted during discharges exerts a short repulsive force on small movable objects along the propagation axis, and the impulse is proportional to the mass of the objects and independent on their composition[\cite=a08] [\cite=a09].

Summary and Discussions

In this paper, the mechanism of gravity impulse is studied in the framework quantum gauge theory of gravity. This mechanism is essentially a new mechanism of generation or absorption of gravitational field or gravitational wave. HFGW should also be explained by this mechanism. It can also be used to help us to construct new kind of gravitational wave detector.

According to equation ([\ref=4.9]), the generated gravitational field [formula] does not depend on the mass of the source. So, strong gravitational field can be generated without huge mass of the object. This mechanism is quite different from the traditional mechanism of classical Newtonian theory of gravity or Einstein's general relativity.

This new mechanism is a direct result of the unified theory of gravitational interactions and electromagnetic interactions. Existence of the gravity impulse is a direct evidence of the validity of the GU(1) unification theory[\cite=w11]. GU(1) unification theory reveals a new mechanism to generate gravitational field, which tells us that, in some special conditions, electromagnetic energy can be directly converted into gravitational energy. This mechanism can help us to utilize and control gravity.
