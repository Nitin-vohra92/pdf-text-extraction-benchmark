Introduction

Interest in the physics of non-Archimedean quantum models [\cite=ADFV],[\cite=FW],[\cite=VVZ],[\cite=MP],[\cite=V2] is based on the idea that the structure of space-time for very short distances might conveniently be described in terms of non-Archimedean numbers. One of the ways to describe this violation of the Archimedean axiom, is the using p-adic analysis (see [\cite=Sh]). Numerous applications of this analysis to mathematical physics have been proposed in papers [\cite=ADFV],[\cite=K1],[\cite=K2],[\cite=MP],[\cite=V2]. It is known [\cite=K2] that a number of p-adic models in physics cannot be described using ordinary Kolmogorov's probability theory [\cite=Ko]. New probability models - p-adic probability models were investigated in [\cite=K2],[\cite=K3]. In [\cite=KL1],[\cite=KL2] the theory of stochastic processes with values in p-adic and more general non-Archimedean fields having probability distributions with non-Archimedean values has been developed. The non-Archimedean analog of the Kolmogorov theorem was proved, that allows to construct wide classes of stochastic processes by using finite dimensional probability distributions. This gives a possibility to develop the theory of statistical mechanics in the context of the p-adic theory, since it lies on the base of the theory of probability and stochastic processes.

One of the central problems of the theory of statistical mechanics is the study of infinite-volume Gibbs measures corresponding to a given Hamiltonian. However, a complete analysis of the set of Gibbs measures for a specific Hamiltonian is often a difficult problem. This problem includes the study of phase transitions problem. Recall that for a given Hamiltonian there is a phase transition if there exist at least two distinct Gibbs measures.

In this paper we develop p-adic probability theory approaches to study some of statistical mechanics models on a Cayley tree in the field of p-adic numbers. In [\cite=GMR] we have proved the existence of the phase transition for the homogeneous p-adic Potts model with q  ≥  3 spin variables on the set of integers [formula]. The present paper deals with nonhomogeneous p-adic λ-model on the Cayley tree of order k, k  ≥  1. The aim of this paper is to show the uniqueness of Gibbs measures for the considered model. In the last section we will apply the obtained results to the p-adic Ising model. Here it should be noted that the existence of a phase transition for the Ising model (real case) on the Cayley tree of order k  ≥  2 was established by Katsura and Takisawa [\cite=KT].

Definitions and preliminary results

p-adic numbers and measures

Throughout the paper p will be a fixed prime number. Every rational number x  ≠  0 can be represented in the form [formula], where [formula], m is a positive integer, (p,n) = 1, (p,m) = 1. The p-adic norm of x is given by

[formula]

It satisfies the following the strong triangle inequality

[formula]

this is a non-Archimedean norm.

The completion of the field of rational numbers [formula] with respect to p-adic norm is called p-adic field and it is denoted by [formula].

Let [formula], where [formula], r > 0. The p-adic logarithm is defined by the series

[formula]

which converges for x∈B(1,1); the p-adic exponential is defined by

[formula]

which converges for x∈B(0,p- 1 / (p - 1)).

Lemma 2.1.[\cite=Kl],[\cite=VVZ]

Let (X,B) be a measurable space, where B is an algebra of subsets X. A function [formula] is said to be a p-adic measure if

[formula]

for any A1,...,An  ⊂  B such that [formula] (i  ≠  j). A p-adic measure is called a probability measure if μ(X) = 1. A p-adic probability measure μ is said to be bounded if sup {|μ(A)|p:A∈B}  <    ∞  .

For more details about p-adic measures we refer the reader to [\cite=K2],[\cite=K3]

Cayley tree

A Cayley tree Γk of order k  ≥  1 is an infinite tree, i.e., a graph without cycles in which each vertex lies on k + 1 edges. Let Γk = (V,L), where V is the set of vertices of Γk, L is the set of edges of Γk. The vertices x and y are called nearest neighbors and they are denoted by l =  < x,y >  if there exists an edge connecting them. A collection of pairs < x,x1 > ,..., < xd - 1,y >  is called a path from the point x to the point y. The distance d(x,y),x,y∈V, on the Cayley tree, is the length of the shortest path from x to y.

Let x0∈V be fixed. We set

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Denote

[formula]

this set is called the set of direct successors of x. Observe that any vertex x  ≠  x0 has k direct successors and x0 has k + 1.

p-adic λ-model

We consider a p-adic λ-model, where the spin takes values in the set [formula] and is assigned to the vertices of the tree. A configuration σ on V is then defined as a function x∈V  →  σ(x)∈Φ; in a similar fashion one defines a configuration σn and σ(n) on Vn and Wn respectively. The set of all configurations on V (resp. Vn, Wn) coincides with Ω  =  ΦV (resp. ΩVn  =  ΦVn,  ΩWn  =  ΦWn). One can see that ΩVn  =  ΩVn - 1  ×  ΩWn. Using this, for given configurations σn - 1∈ΩVn - 1 and σ(n)∈ΩWn we define their concatenations by the formula

[formula]

It is clear that [formula]. Let functions [formula] be given for each pairs of neighboring vertices x,y. The Hamiltonian [formula] of the p-adic inhomogeneous λ-model has the form

[formula]

where the sum is taken over all pairs of neighboring vertices < x,y >  and σn∈ΩVn.

We say that (2.1) is homogeneous λ-model if all functions λxy(u,v) do not depend on x,y and in this case we put [formula]

We note that λ-model of this type were firstly considered in [\cite=R].

Before giving a construction of a special class of Gibbs measures for p-adic λ-model on the Cayley tree we need the following

Lemma 2.2. Let hx,x∈V be a [formula]-valued function such that hx∈B(0,p- 1 / (p - 1)) for all x∈V and |λx,y(u,v)|p < p- 1 / (p - 1) for all u,v∈Φ and < x,y > ∈L. Then the relation

[formula]

is valid for any [formula].

The proof easily follows from the strong triangle inequality for the norm |  ·  |p.

Let [formula] be a function of x∈V such that |hx|p < p- 1 / (p - 1) for all x∈V. Given n = 1,2,..., consider a p-adic probability measure [formula] on ΩVn defined by

[formula]

Here, as before, σn:x∈Vn  →  σn(x) and Zn is the corresponding partition function:

[formula]

Note that according to Lemma 2.2 the measures [formula] exist.

The compatibility conditions for [formula] are given by the equality

[formula]

where σn - 1∈ΩVn - 1.

We note that an analog of the Kolmogorov extension theorem for distributions can be proved for p-adic distributions given by (2.2) (see [\cite=KL2]). Then according to the Kolmogorov theorem there exists a unique p-adic measure [formula] on Ω  =  ΦV such that for every n = 1,2,... and σn∈ΦVn the equality holds

[formula]

which will be called a p-adic Gibbs measure for the considered λ-model. It is clear that the measure [formula] depends on the function hx. By Sł we denote the set of all p-adic Gibbs measures associated with functions [formula]. If |Sł|  ≥  2, then we say that for this model there exists a phase transition, otherwise, we say there is no phase transition ( here |A| means the cardinality of a set A). In other words, the phase transition means that there are two different functions [formula] and [formula] for which there exists two [formula] and [formula] p-adic Gibbs measures on Ω, respectively.

The following statement describes conditions on hx guaranteeing that the compatibility conditions are satisfied by measures [formula].

Theorem 2.3. The measures [formula] satisfy the compatibility condition (2.3) if and only if for any x∈V the following equation holds:

[formula]

where S(x) is the set of all direct successors of x∈V and

[formula]

Proof. Using (2.2), it is easy to see that (2.3) and (2.4) are equivalent.(cf. [\cite=R]).

Observe that according to this Theorem the problem of describing of S is reduced to that of solutions of functional equation (2.4).

Uniqueness of Gibbs measure for the p-adic λ-model

In this section we will show that the phase transition does not occur for the p-adic λ-model.

Set

[formula]

According to Theorem 2.3 the description of Sł is reduced to the description of elements of the set Ξ.

Set

[formula]

The following Theorem is the main result of the paper.

Theorem 3.1. Assume that one of the following conditions is satisfied:

p  ≥  3 and [formula] for all < x,y > ∈L, u,v∈Φ;

p = 2 and

[formula]

for all < x,y > ∈L,u,v∈Φ;

Then for the p-adic λ-model (2.1) on the Cayley tree of order k there is no phase transition for any prime p, i.e. |Sł|  ≤  1.

Proof. If [formula], then nothing to prove. So, assume that [formula]. To prove Theorem it is enough to show that any two elements of Ξ coincide with each other. In order to do this it is enough to show that for arbitrary ε > 0 and every [formula] and x∈V the inequality |hx - sx|p  <  ε is valid.

Take [formula]. Let x∈V be an arbitrary vertex. Using (3.1) and Lemma 2.1, consider the difference

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Likewise we get

[formula]

Now consider two distinct cases with respect to p.

Let us assume that p  ≥  3. In this case by means of above relations we find

[formula]

Now suppose that p = 2 and the condition (3.2) is satisfied, then in this case by similar way as above we obtain

[formula]

This with the above relations imply that

[formula]

Let us numerate elements of S(x) as follows S(x) = {x1,...,xk}, here as before S(x) is the set of direct successors of x.

Let ε > 0 be an arbitrary number. Take [formula] such that [formula]. Using (3.3) (resp. (3.4)) we have

[formula]

here xi0,...,in,j, [formula] are direct successors of xi0,...,in, where

[formula]

This completes the proof.

Remark 3.1. In the next section we will show that Sł is non-empty for the Ising model.

Remark 3.2. From the proof of Theorem 3.1 it might seem that Ξ consists only of the single element [formula]. But, in general, this is not true. Now we give an example of homogeneous λ-model, for which Ξ does not contain [formula]. For the sake of simplicity consider the case p = 3.

Put

[formula]

According to Lemma 2.1 we easily find that the condition (i) of Theorem 3.1 is satisfied. Now we search a solution of the equation (2.4) of the form [formula]. Then (2.4) reduces to the following equation

[formula]

where z =  exp 3(2h). By using the Hensel Lemma (see [\cite=Kl]), one can prove that the equation (3.5) has a unique solution, such that |z - 1|3  ≤  1 / 3, which is obviously different from z = 1.

Let us assume that [formula]. Now we are interested whether the unique Gibbs measure is bounded. The following theorem answers to the question.

Theorem 3.2. The p-adic Gibbs measure μ corresponding to the p-adic λ- model on the Cayley tree of order k is bounded if and and only if p  ≠  2.

Proof. It suffices to show that the values of μ on cylindrical subsets are bounded.

Let us assume that p  ≥  3 and estimate |μ(n)(σn)|p:

[formula]

here we have used Lemma 2.1, where

[formula]

Put

[formula]

where u,v∈Φ, < x,y > ∈L.

To prove that the measure μ is not bounded at p = 2 it is enough to show that its marginal measure is not bounded. Let π  =  {...,x- 1,x0,x1,...} be an arbitrary infinite path in Γk. From (2.2) one can see that a marginal measure μπ on Ψπ has the form

[formula]

here ωn:{x- n,...,x0,...,xn}  →  Ψ, i.e. ωn is a configuration on {x- n,...,x0,...,xn}, pxyi is an invariant vector for the matrix (pxyij)ij∈Φ.

Using again Lemma 2.1 from (3.6) we infer that

[formula]

for all i,j, here again we have used Lemma 2.1. From (3.7) and (3.8) we find that μπ is not bounded. The theorem is proved.

Applications to p-adic Ising model

In this section we will show that the phase transition does not occur for the p-adic Ising model.

Recall what is a p-adic Ising model. This is a particular case of λ-model and it corresponds to the function:

[formula]

where |Jx,y| < p- 1 / (p - 1), |ηx|p  <  p- 1 / (p - 1) and < x,y > ∈L, u,v∈{ - 1,1}.

Let us check the condition (3.2) for the Ising model. Let p = 2, then the condition (3.2) can be written as follows

[formula]

[formula]

Hence (3.2) is satisfied.

From now consider two particular cases of the model:

[formula]

here |J| < p- 1 / (p - 1), |η|p  <  p- 1 / (p - 1).

It is easy to see that for the inhomogeneous model the equation (2.4) has a solution h = (hx = 0, x∈V), so Sł is not empty.

Thus, we can formulate the following

Theorem 4.1. Let k  ≥  1, and |Jx,y|p < p- 1 / (p - 1) for all < x,y > ∈L. Then for the nonhomogeneous p-adic Ising model on the Cayley tree of order k there is a unique Gibbs measure.

Now turn to homogeneous case. We want to show that [formula]. We will search a solution of (2.4) of the form [formula].

Let hx = h for all x∈V. Then (2.4) has the following form

[formula]

where z =  exp p(2h), α  =   exp p(2J + 2η) and β  =   exp p(2J - 2η).

Denote

[formula]

Let [formula]. Then it is clear that f(S1)  ⊂  S1. Using this fact and Lemma 2.1, for every x∈S1, we find

[formula]

By the same argument as the proof of Theorem 3.1, with using (4.1), for every x,y∈S1 one gets

[formula]

for every p  ≥  2.

Thus the inequality (4.3) implies that f is a contraction of S1, hence f has a unique fixed point ζ∈S1 such that [formula] (see (4.2)). So combining Theorem 3.1 we have proved the following

Theorem 4.2. Let k  ≥  1, |J|p < p- 1 / (p - 1) and |η|p < p- 1 / (p - 1). Then for the homogeneous p-adic Ising model on the Cayley tree of order k there is a unique Gibbs measure.

Remark 4.1. It is known [\cite=KT],[\cite=Ru] that for the Ising model on the Cayley tree of order k  ≥  2 over [formula] under some condition on parameter Jx,y (resp. J and η) there is a phase transition. Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 show the difference between real the Ising model and the p-adic one.

Remark 4.2. In [\cite=GMR] we proved that a phase transition can occur for q-state (q  ≥  3) homogeneous p-adic Potts model on [formula] whenever q is divided by a prime p. It is known [\cite=B] that 2-state Potts model reduces to the Ising model. So, Theorem 4.2 shows that in case p = 2 for the Ising model there is no phase transition.

From Theorem 3.2 we deduce the following

Corollary 4.3. The unique p-adic Gibbs measure μ corresponding to the nonhomogeneous (resp. homogeneous) p-adic Ising model on the Cayley tree of order k is bounded if and only if p  ≠  2.

For the p-adic Ising model we have seen that a phase transition does not occur, so Corollary 4.3 implies that if p = 2, then the p-adic Gibbs measure may not be bounded in this setting.
