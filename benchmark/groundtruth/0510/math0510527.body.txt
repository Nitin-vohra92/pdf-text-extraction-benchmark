Absolutely Continuous Invariant Measures for Nonuniformly Expanding Maps

Sandro Vaienti

Introduction

A challenge problem in smooth ergodic theory is to construct invariant measures for multidimensional maps T with some sort of weak hyperbolicity and then to study their statistical properties (decay of correlations, central limit theorem, distribution of return times, etc.). For nonuniformly expanding endomorphisms of [formula], only few results exist at the moment. When the system has a Bernoulli structure, or verifies the so-called "finite range structure", and it enjoys a suitable distortion relation (Renyi's condition), M. Yuri [\cite=Yu1] [\cite=Yu2] was able to construct an invariant, possibly σ-finite, measure absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Young's tower ([\cite=Yo1] [\cite=Yo2]), which is mainly for nonuniformly hyperbolic systems, also works for nonuniformly expanding maps, and the invariant measures and other statistical properties can be obtained, if some bounded distortion properties are assumed. In Alves-Bonatti-Viana's work ([\cite=ABV], also see [\cite=A1] [\cite=A2] [\cite=ALP]), nonuniformly expansion are understood as the average value of log ||DT(x)- 1|| along the orbits to be less than zero for almost every points. Under some conditions on the set of critical points, they can construct an absolutely continuous invariant measure. Recently this theory has been applied to maps which allow contraction in some regions [\cite=O] [\cite=AT].

The aim of our paper is to treat a class of nonsingular transformations with indifferent fixed points which do not enjoy any Markov property. We obtain existence of absolutely continuous invariant measures that can be finite or infinite, depending on the behaviour of T near the fixed point. The technique we use consists of the following steps. We first replace the transformation with the first return map with respect to the domain outside a small region around the indifferent fixed point. What we get is a uniformly expanding map with a countable number of discontinuity surfaces. Then we prove a Lasota-Yorke [\cite=LY] inequality on the induced space by acting the Perron-Frobenius operator on the space of "quasi-Hölder" functions, particularly adapted when the invariant densities are discontinuous. As soon as the Lasota-Yorke inequality has been proved, simple compactness argument will allow us to apply the Ionescu-Tulcea and Marinescu theorem to conclude that there exists an absolutely continuous invariant measure. The space of quasi-Hölder functions, introduced by Keller [\cite=K], developed by Blank [\cite=BB] and successfully applied by Saussol [\cite=S] and successively by Buzzi [\cite=B] (see also [\cite=BK]) and Tsujii [\cite=T] to the multidimensional expanding case, reveals to be very useful to control the oscillations of a function under the iteration of the PF operator across the discontinuities of the map. The use of the more standard space of bounded variation functions allowed as well to get absolute invariant measures for a wide class of piecewise expanding maps, see, for instance [\cite=GB] [\cite=PGB] [\cite=KZ] [\cite=WC].

In adapting to our situation the Saussol's strategy to prove the Lasota-Yorke inequality, the difficult part comes from the indifferent fixed points. Unlike in one dimensional case, the maps in higher dimensional space have unbounded distortion away from the indifferent fixed points, that is, there are uncountably many points x, whose neighborhoods contain points y, arbitrary close to x, such that the distortion of [formula] is unbounded along the backward orbits towards the indifferent fixed point (see Example 1 in Section 2). This forced us to a certain number of assumptions which basically reduce to insure sufficiently good expanding rates in a small neighborhood of the neutral point, and insure bounded distortion along the curves close to radial directions (Assumption 4(b) and (c)). A careful view at the proofs will reveal that such assumptions are unavoidable, unless to modify deeply all the structure of the approach. We nevertheless point out that our hypothesis could be easily verified on some simple cases if the local behavior of the map T near the indifferent fixed points is understood. On the other hand, it seems that other known techniques are difficult to apply. Since we know that distortions are unbounded for the maps we are interested in, Young's results cannot be applied directly. Also, the condition [formula] in [\cite=ABV] cannot be obtained in our case (and in fact it fails if T admit a σ-finite absolutely continuous invariant measures). If we study the first return maps T̂ instead, then [formula] can be arbitrary large for x close to the discontinuity set, and therefore the assumptions on the critical set in [\cite=ABV] are not satisfied.

The plan of the paper is the following: in Section 1 we state the assumptions and the main theorems, A and B. Section 2 is devoted to examples. The proofs of the main results are in Section 3 through 6.

Assumptions and statements of results

Let [formula] be a compact subset with [formula] and d be the Euclidean distance. Let ν be the Lebesgue measure on M. We assume νM = 1.

For A  ⊂  M and ε > 0, denote [formula].

Let T:M  →  M be an almost expanding piecewise smooth map with an indifferent fixed point p.

We assume that T satisfies the following assumptions.

Since [formula], we may take a coordinate system such that p = 0. Hence, we write |x| = d(x,p) if x∈M.

For any x∈Ui, we define s(x) = s(x,T) by

[formula]

Denote by γm the volume of the unit ball in [formula].

By Assumption 3(a), the map Tj:Uj  →  Tj(Uj) is noncontracting for each j, and therefore it is a local diffeomorphisms. Also, by the assumption, for any x∈U1, T- n1x  →  p, because the set of limit points of {T- n1x} cannot contain any other point but p.

Assumption 3(b) is the main assumption that requires uniformly expanding outside R and gives condition on the relations between expanding rates and discontinuity. We refer to [\cite=S] for more details about the meaning of GU(ε,ε0). (In fact, for small ε0, GU(ε,ε0)ε0  /  ε is greater than 4sγm - 1 / (1 - s)γ- 1m if there are at least two surfaces ∂Ui meet at some point. See Lemma 2.1 in [\cite=S].)

Assumption 3(b) implies ν(∂Uj) = 0 for any [formula].

We allow that s(x,T) = 1 for some x other than p. However we still need some expanding rate inside R. This is given by Assumption 3(c). If s(T- N1(x),TN1) can be arbitrarily small by taking N sufficiently large, then Assumption 3(c) is always true.

Denote [formula]. Clearly, R0  ⊂  U1 because of the choice of R.

In fact, Assumption 4(a) is a consequence of Assumption 1. However, we state it here independently due to its importance for our arguments.

If T- 11 has bounded distortion in Bε5(R0) in the sense that for any J0 > 1, there is ε > 0 such that for any x,y∈Bε5(R0) with d(x,y)  ≤  ε and for any n > 0, [formula], then Assumption 4(b) and (c) are true with ε4  =  ε5  =  ε0.

Actually, by our proof the condition [formula] in Assumption 4(c) can be replace by

[formula]

for all n  ≥  Ns, where s and Ns are given by Assumption 3(b) and (c) respectively (see ([\ref=diamAijk])).

When we iterate the system, oscillations of the test functions are produced by both discontinuities ∂Uj and distortion of [formula]. It is very common for an expanding system in multidimensional space with an indifferent fixed point to have unbounded distortion near the fixed point. (See Example 1 in Section [\ref=examples]). Assumption 4(b) requires that either the distortion of [formula] or [formula] itself is small. On the other hand, if the distortion of [formula] is bounded along the radial direction, then Assumption 4(c) holds.

We will give an example in Section 2 showing that it is possible for μ to have both finite and σ-finite ergodic components simultaneously, and both contain the same indifferent fixed point p in their supports.

Since Assumption 4(b) and 4(c) are difficult to verify, we give some sufficient conditions in the next theorem.

One of the interesting cases we would discuss is the following: there are constants γ' > γ > 0, Ci,Ci' > 0, i = 0,1,2, such that

[formula]

If T satisfies all of the inequalities, then [formula]. So DTp is either the identity or a rotation. If T satisfies the second inequalities in ([\ref=B.0])-([\ref=B.2]), then [formula] may have eigenvalues greater than 1.

In the theorem below, we denote by [formula] the subspace spanned by vectors [formula], and by Ex(S) the tangent space of a submanifold S at a point x∈S. Also, we may use a coordinate system (t,φ) near p where t = |x| and [formula], the m - 1 dimensional sphere.

The condition in Theorem B.I).i) means that DTp has at least one eigenvalue with absolute value greater than 1.

The condition in Theorem B.II).ii) part (c) implies that under DT, vectors in the cone Cx expands faster than that in Cx'.

If we write [formula], where T0 = DTp, [formula] satisfies [formula] [formula] and |Th(x)| = O(|x|γ'), γ' > γ, then the cones {Cx} and {Cx'} are mainly determined by [formula] as x near p. So it is easy to get uniformity near t = 0.

Examples

In the next example we show that near an indifferent fixed point p of a map [formula], distortion may be unbounded even away from p in the sense that there is a point z such that for any neighborhood V of z, we can find ẑ∈V such that the ratio

[formula]

is unbounded as n  →    ∞  .

Define [formula] in such a way around (0,0) it behaves like:

[formula]

It is easy to see that

[formula]

and

[formula]

where z = (x,y) and [formula].

Note that in this example, T is locally injective and T- 1 will denote its inverse. Take z' = (x0,0) and denote zn' = T- nz'. By Lemma [\ref=lemma3.1] in the next section, we have [formula], where an  ~  bn means [formula]. Hence by ([\ref=2.3]) and Lemma [\ref=lemma3.2], [formula] for some D' > 0. On the other hand if we take z'' = (0,y0) and denote zn'' = T- nz'', then [formula] and [formula] for some D'' > 0. So [formula] as n  →    ∞  .

Suppose that for every [formula], there is a neighborhood V such that for all ẑ∈V, the ratio in ([\ref=2.0]) is bounded for all n > 0. We take a curve from z' to z'' that does not contain the origin. By choosing finite cover on the curve, we know that the ratio [formula] should be bounded. This is a contradiction. It means that there are some points away from (0,0) at which distortion is unbounded.

In the next two examples we show how to get Assumption 4(b) and 4(c) by applying Theorem B.

Let [formula] be given by

[formula]

as (x,y,z) near the origin.

Note that by similar arguments as above we know that for this map the distortion is also unbounded away from the origin.

Since [formula] and T is C∞ near the origin, by Theorem B.I).i), Assumption 4(b) is satisfied.

Let Ci, [formula], be the eight octants in [formula], and define a partial order "[formula]" by letting [formula] if |x1|  ≤  |x2|, |y1|  ≤  |y2| and |z1|  ≤  |z2|. Clearly all the requirements in Theorem B.II).i) are satisfied. So we get Assumption 4(c) as well.

Let [formula] be defined as in the first example.

For any z = (x,y), we denote zn = T- nz.

Note that

[formula]

or

[formula]

So by Lemma [\ref=lemma3.1], we have

[formula]

for some integer k, where β' > 1 / 2.

Since ([\ref=2.3]) implies that [formula], by ([\ref=f2.4]) and Lemma [\ref=lemma3.2] we get

[formula]

Also by ([\ref=2.2]),

[formula]

So [formula], hence by Lemma [\ref=lemma3.2],

[formula]

for some D' > 0. Now by ([\ref=f2.5]), ([\ref=f2.7]) and ([\ref=B.6]), we know that δ = 5 / 2 and τ = 1 / 2. Since m = 2 and γ = 2, we have ([\ref=B.5]) if α = 1 / 2. By Theorem B.I).ii), T satisfies Assumption 4(b).

Now we check that T satisfies Assumption 4(c). It is obvious that we can use Theorem B.II).i). However, we use this map to show how to apply Theorem B.II).ii).

Note that if we take two vectors v0 = (x,y)* and v0' = (y, - x)* at the tangent plane of z = (x,y), where the asterisk denotes transpose, then by ([\ref=2.2]) we have

[formula]

This means that |DTz(v0')| < |DTz(v0)|. We define Cz at each point z as the cone bounded by lines generated by vectors 3v0 + 2v0' and 3v0 - 2v0' and containing v0, and define Cz' as the cone bounded by lines generated by vectors 3v0' + 2v0 and 3v0' - 2v0 and disjoint with Cz. We can check that Part (a) and (b) in Theorem B.II).ii) are satisfied. Also we can check that for all unit vector v'∈Cz', |DTz(v')|  ≤  |Tz|2.5 / |z|2.5. So if we take R in such a way that the tangent lines of ∂(T- n01R) are in the cones C' for some n0  ≥  0, then we use the fact DT- 1(C')  ⊂  C' to get that Part (c) is satisfied for all n  ≥  n0 with 1 - θ = 2 / 5.

In the next example the absolute continuous invariant measure μ has a finite and a σ-finite ergodic components simultaneously, and both contain the same indifferent fixed point p in their supports.

Suppose the map T:M  →  M satisfies Assumption 1 - 4(a), and in a neighborhood, say B1(p), of the indifferent fixed point p, T has the form as in ([\ref=f2.1]).

We also assume that there is a partition of M = {M1,M2} such that for i = 1,2, TMi = Mi and for any ball [formula] in Mi, there exists an integer N such that [formula], and

[formula]

This is possible since it is easy to check that [formula], where Γ  =  {(x,y)∈B1(p):y  =  x2}.

By the above example, we know that T also satisfies Assumption 4(b) and 4(c). Therefore Theorem A can be applied. Since both M1 and M2 are invariant sets, T has absolutely continuous invariant measures μ1 and μ2 with respect to the Lebesgue measure restricted to M1 and M2 respectively. Now we show μ1M1  <    ∞   and μ2M2  =    ∞  .

For this purpose we may assume that R = B1(p). By ([\ref=f2.4]), we know that [formula] for all large n. So

[formula]

for some C > 0. It follows that [formula]. Applying Theorem A to the system T:M1  →  M1, we get that μ1M1  ≤    ∞  .

Also, by ([\ref=f2.4]), we have that [formula] for all large n. Hence it is easy to see that ν(T- n1R)  ≥  π / 16n and therefore [formula]. Since [formula], we get [formula]. So we have μ2M2  =    ∞  .

Proof of Theorem B, Part I)

We first prove a few Lemmas.

For γ > 0, let β = 1 / γ.

If

[formula]

where γ' > γ, then for all large n,

[formula]

for some β' > β and [formula]. The result remains true if we exchange "≤  " and "≥  ". Therefore, if ([\ref=3.1]) becomes an equality, then so does ([\ref=3.2]).

Proof: We claim that if

[formula]

for some large n and

[formula]

for some δ' > 0, then

[formula]

This gives the results since we can choose an integer k such that for some large n0 > 0,

[formula]

By relabelling the indices, the claim implies ([\ref=3.2]) for all n  ≥  n0.

Now we prove the claim. Denote [formula]. By ([\ref=3.1a]) and ([\ref=3.1b]),

[formula]

To prove the lemma we only need to show that

[formula]

or, equivalently,

[formula]

Take δ' <  min {1,γ' / γ - 1}. Then (nγn)- (γ' / γ) is of higher order. We can check that as n  →    ∞  , the left side of the inequality is like 1 + n- (1 + δ') and the right side is like 1 + δ'n- (1 + δ'). Since δ' < 1, the right side is smaller as n large. [formula]

If for all n > 0, tn satisfies ([\ref=3.2]), and [formula], where C' > 0, then there exists D > 0 such that for all k0  ≥  k,

[formula]

The result remains true if we replace "≤  " by "≥  " in all three inequalities.

Proof: Note that

[formula]

where γ' > 0. Then we take the product. [formula]

Let θ∈(0,1) and 1',2,1  >  0, and let [formula] be a bounded region containing the origin. Suppose the map [formula] is injective with T- 1  ⊂   and satisfies

[formula]

for all x,y∈ with d(x,y)  ≤  |x| / 2. Then there exists J' > 0 such that for all x,y∈T with

[formula]

where xi = T- ix and yi = T- iy, we have

[formula]

Proof: We prove by induction that for all [formula],

[formula]

For i = 1, by ([\ref=3.5]), ([\ref=3.6]) and ([\ref=3.4]), we have

[formula]

So if [formula] then the right side of the inequality is less than [formula] because |xn|  ≤  |x|.

Suppose ([\ref=3.8]) is true up to i = k - 1. Then similarly we have

[formula]

Clearly if J' is large enough, then the right side is bounded by [formula]. We get ([\ref=3.8]) for i = k. [formula]

Proof of Theorem B, Part I):

i)  We may assume that T is C1 +  and [formula] on TR, because otherwise we can increase N(ε) and J. We may also regard   ≤  1. So there exist c1 > 0 such that

[formula]

for all x,y∈TR. Let xi = T- i1x and yi = T- i1y. Clearly, d(xi,yi)  ≤  d(x,y). So if d(x,y)  ≤  ε and 0 < n  ≤  N, then

[formula]

Also, there exists C > 0 such that for any [formula], [formula]. Hence,

[formula]

Let b > 0 be given.

Consider the function

[formula]

where N0 = 1 +  log (C- 1b(1 - κ)) /  log κ and c2 =  - (m + α) /  log κ. Since [formula], we have [formula]. Note that if

[formula]

then σ'(ε) < 0. Since   >  α, the first term in ([\ref=B.aa2]) is of higher order. So we can choose J > 0 and ε4 > 0 such that for all ε∈(0,ε4], ([\ref=B.aa2]) holds and therefore σ(ε)  ≤  1.

Now for each ε∈(0,ε4], we take N = N(ε) as the integer part of N0 - c2 log ε. Clearly, for such N we have

[formula]

So the second inequality in Assumption 4(b) is true. For the first inequality, note that

[formula]

Then by ([\ref=B.aa1]) we get what we need.

ii)  Denote β = 1 / γ and θ  =  α. Take ρ > 0 such that

[formula]

Let b > 0 be given.

Note that by Lemma [\ref=lemma3.1], ([\ref=B.0]) implies that there exists 0 > 0 such that for any x∈R0, [formula]. Take Nb  ≥  L such that for all n  ≥  Nb,

[formula]

where [formula] and Cτ are as in ([\ref=B.6]). The inequality is possible because of ([\ref=B.11]).

Note that ([\ref=B.1]) and ([\ref=B.2]) imply ([\ref=3.4]) and ([\ref=3.5]) respectively. By Lemma [\ref=lemma3.3] we can take J' > 0 such that ([\ref=3.7]) holds for any x∈R0, n > 0 whenever ([\ref=3.6]) holds with 1 = 1 for all xi,yi, [formula].

Take ε4' > 0 such that for all x,y with x∈R0, d(x,y)  ≤  ε4', [formula], we have d(xn,yn)1 - θ  ≤  |xn|. By the choice of J', ([\ref=3.7]) holds for all 1  ≤  n  ≤  Nb.

Then we take ε4  =   min {ε4',1 / Nρb}, and J > 0 such that [formula].

We show that J and ε4 satisfies the requirement. Let ε∈(0,ε4]. Take N = N(ε) > Nb such that

[formula]

By the first inequality of ([\ref=B.6]) and ([\ref=B.13]),

[formula]

On the other hand, if x∈R0 and d(x,y)  ≤  ε, then by the last inequality of ([\ref=B.6]) and ([\ref=B.13]), for any Nb  <  n  ≤  N,

[formula]

So we know that ([\ref=3.7]) holds for all 0  ≤  n  ≤  N. Then by the choice of J and the fact θ  =  α,

[formula]

This is what we need. [formula]

Proof of Theorem B, Part II)

This proof consist of two parts, i) and ii).

i)  For x∈∂R, denote

[formula]

Clearly the collection [formula] form a cover of [formula]. So we can construct a partition ξ of R0 such that every element of ξ belongs to some D(x).

Note that for any x,

[formula]

is always bounded. So for any y,z∈D(x), we have

[formula]

Hence ([\ref=dist]) follows. Obviously we can arrange the partition ξ in such a way that ([\ref=vol]) also holds. Therefore ξ is a desired partition for any n.

ii)  First, we take θ > 0 such that

[formula]

for all x∈∂(T- n1R) and v'∈Ex(∂(T- n1R)). This is possible because of the assumption stated in Part (d) of Theorem B.(II). So for any n > 0, if we take x,y∈∂R0 such that d(xn,yn)  ≤  1|xn|1 / (1 - θ), we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lemma3.3], we get that there exists I1 > 0 such that

[formula]

That is, ([\ref=dist]) holds for all such x,y.

We construct ξ  =  ξn. Note that we only need do it for n sufficiently large. Since the family of cones C'x are continuous uniformly in (t,φ), we can find t0 > 0 such that for any x,y∈TR with d(x,y)  ≤  t0, the Hausdorff distance between C'x and C'y is less than θ0 / 2. Then we take N > 0 large enough such that for any x∈R0 and n > N, |xn|  ≤  t0. Note that for any x, the position vector from p to x, denoted by ux, is contained in Cx. By Part (a) and (d) in the conditions of the theorem we know that at x∈T- n1(∂R0), Cx' contains the tangent plane of the surface. Hence, if v'∈Ex(T- n1(∂R0), then the angle between ux and v', denoted by [formula], is larger than θ0, and therefore for any v'∈Ey(T- n1(∂R0), we have [formula], whenever y∈T- n1(∂R0) with d(x,y)  ≤  t0. So for any x,y∈T- n1(∂R0) with d(x,y)  ≤  t0, we have dS(x,y)  ≤  d(x,y) /  sin (θ0 / 2), where dS(  ·  ,  ·  ) is the distance restricted to the surfaces {T- n1(∂R0)}. This means that we can take a partition ξ(n) on T- n1(∂R0) such that every element of ξ(n) is contained in a ball of radius |xn|1 / (1 - θ) and containing a ball of radius |xn|1 / (1 - θ) / 10m sin (θ0 / 2), with respect to the metric on T- n1(∂R0), and these elements are close to (m - 1) dimensional disks. Denote ξ' = Tnξ(n). Clearly, it is a partition of ∂R0. Then we can take a partition ξ of R0 whose elements has the form [formula], where A' is an element of ξ', and Fx is given in Lemma [\ref=lemma4.0].

Now we prove that ξ satisfies ([\ref=vol]) and ([\ref=dist]). Condition ([\ref=B.1]) implies [formula]. We first consider the case that [formula].

By ([\ref=B.0]), we know that d(x,Tx)  ≤  C|x|1 + γ for some C > 0. So the "width" of the annulus T- i1(Bε5(R0)) is bounded by C'|T- i1x|1 + γ for some C' > 0. By Part (b) and (d) of the condition in the theorem, for 0 < ε  ≤  ε5, [formula], the angle between the tangent space of [formula] and the position vector ux is larger than θ0. So the length of the curve [formula] is bounded by C|T- i1x|1 + γ for some C  ≥  C'. Hence, for any x,y∈Bε5(R0) with y∈Fx, we can get

[formula]

and therefore by applying Lemma [\ref=lemma3.3] get

[formula]

for some I2 > 0. Also, the construction of ξ' implies ([\ref=distanceb]) and therefore ([\ref=distortionb]) for any x,y∈A', where A'∈ξ'. So by the construction of ξ, we get ([\ref=dist]) with I = I1I22 for any x,y∈A.

On the other hand, for any x,y∈Bε5(R0) with y∈Fx, we have ([\ref=distancec]). So we can apply Lemma [\ref=lemma4.3] to get that inside A, distortion of |DT|E(F)| is bounded. It means that for each x∈A, the ratio of the length of [formula] and the length of [formula] is uniformly bounded by ε  /  ε0 multiplied by a constant. Notice that the angle between the tangent vectors of F and the tangent space of T- n1(∂Bε(R0)) are greater than θ0. Also notice that by the construction of ξ', for any A∈ξ, the size of the set T- n1A along the fiber direction is much smaller than the size of T- n1A'. Hence, the ratio between [formula] and [formula] is bounded by a constant times [formula] for some α∈(0,1]. Now we use ([\ref=dist]) to get ([\ref=vol]).

If [formula], then it is a rotation, say S. Hence near p we can write Tx = Sx + Tr(x) where |Tr(x)|  ≤  C|x|1 + γ. If we write [formula], then [formula]. It implies that the "width" of the annulus T- i1R0 is bounded by C|T- i1x|1 + γ. Then we apply the same arguments to get ([\ref=dist]) and ([\ref=vol]). [formula]

There is a foliation on {Fx} on [formula] consisting of curves from p to points on ∂(TR) such that for any x∈TR, the tangent line of Fx lies in Cx, and [formula].

Proof: Denote [formula] for all [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lemma4.1], we know that sine of the angle between any two vectors in DTnT- n1x(CT- n1x) is less than [formula]. By ([\ref=B.0]) and Lemma [\ref=lemma3.1], the product diverges as n  →    ∞  . So {Ex} is a subbundle of the tangent bundle over [formula]. Further, we have DTx(Ex) = ETx for all x∈R. By Lemma [\ref=lemma4.2], we know that {Ex} satisfies the Hölder condition near each x with Hölder constants depending on x. Note that {Ex} determines a vector field. We can integrate it to get a family of curves {Fx} from p to boundary points of TR that satisfies [formula]. By our assumption, {Fx} is the "strong unstable manifold" at x.

It is easy to see that the curve passing through x is unique, and therefore {Fx} forms a foliation. In fact, if there are two such curves Fx and Fx' that pass through x, then we can take a curve Γ close to x joining y∈Fx and y'∈Fx' such that the tangent line of Γ is in C'. Let us denote by An the area of the "triangle" bounded by the curves T- n1Γ, T- n1Fx,y and T- n1F'x,y', and by Ln and L'n the lengths of the curves T- n1Fx,y and T- n1F'x,y' respectively, where Fx,y is the part of the curve in Fx between x and y, and F'x,y' is understood in a similar way. By the assumption stated in Part (c), the ratio between An and Ln  ·  Ln' tends to infinity, a contradiction. [formula]

For any v,v'∈Cx,

[formula]

where the symbol [formula] denotes the angle between the vectors v and v'.

Proof: Note that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then the results follows from ([\ref=B.strong]). [formula]

There exist constants H > 0, a > 0, and τ1∈(0,1), such that for all [formula],

[formula]

where d(Ex,Ey) is defined by [formula], vx and vy are the tangent vectors of Fx and Fy at x and y respectively chosen in the way that [formula].

Proof: We note that we only need prove ([\ref=L4] [\ref=2]) for all x in a small neighborhood   ⊂  R of p, because DTx(Ex) = ETx, and then the results can be extended to TR.

Take d̃∈(0,d). Then for each x we can extend Cx to x such that ([\ref=B.strong]) hold with d̃ for all v∈Cx and v'∈x. By ([\ref=B.0]) and the fact that T is C1 + γ, we can write [formula], where T0 = DTp, [formula] satisfies [formula] [formula] and |Th(x)| = o(|x|γ). So it is easy to see that we can find εa > 0 such that [formula] contains an εa-neighborhood of [formula] in [formula] for all x with |x| small. Moreover, since Cx is uniformly continuous in (t,φ), we can take a > 0 and [formula] small such that for all x∈, with [formula], Cy  ⊂  x. So if v∈Cx and v'∈Cy, we have

[formula]

Hence, by the same arguments used in Lemma [\ref=lemma4.1] we have

[formula]

Take τ1∈(0,1) such that

[formula]

for all x∈ close to p with d(x,y)  ≤  a|x|.

Take 0 < a1  ≤  a such that if d(x,y)  ≤  a1|x|, then

[formula]

for some 2 > 0. This is possible because of ([\ref=B.2]).

Take H > 0 such that Hd̃ > 22.

Let [formula] be the set of all line bundles in the tangent bundle over [formula]. Clearly DT induces a map D:L  →  L given by (DL)x = DTx(LT- 11x), and E  =  {Ex} is the unique fixed point of D contained in C. Denote

[formula]

We show that D(H)  ⊂  H. This implies the result since [formula].

Take {Lx}∈H. Let x,y∈ with d(x,y)  ≤  a1|x|. Take unit vectors ex∈Lx, ey∈Ly. So [formula]. By ([\ref=angle]) and ([\ref=barC2]),

[formula]

By the choice of H, the quantity in the blanket is less than [formula]. Then by ([\ref=tau1]) the right side of the inequality is less than H|Tx|-  τ1d(Tx,Ty)τ1. We get the desired results. [formula]

There exists J* > 0 such that for any x,y with [formula] for some  > 1, [formula],

[formula]

Proof: Take an integer   ≥  2C0' / C0, where C0 and C0' are as in ([\ref=B.1]). We assume that [formula] for some k0  ≥  1. Then we take ki = (i - 1)k0 for [formula], where [formula] is the largest number j such that kj  <  n. Let [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lemma3.1], we know that

[formula]

Hence, ([\ref=B.1]) implies

[formula]

for some C larger than 2C / γC0' if ki is large enough. So the choice of [formula] gives

[formula]

for all i  ≥  0.

Let ex be the unit tangent vector of F at x. We have

[formula]

By the results of Lemma [\ref=lemma4.2] and ([\ref=ineqDT]), each factor in the first product is bounded by

[formula]

where we use the fact that [formula] for some B > 0. Also note that by ([\ref=xj]) and the choice of ki, {|xki|} decreases exponentially fast as i  →    ∞  . Since  > 1, the first product in above equality is convergent.

For the second product, by ([\ref=B.2]) each factor is bounded by

[formula]

By ([\ref=xj]) and the fact  > 1, we know that [formula] converges. So the product is also bounded. We get the result. [formula]

Proof of Theorem A

In this section we first introduce a subspace [formula] of [formula] with compact unit ball that contains the density function of the invariant measures of the induced map of T with respect to the relatively compact subspace [formula]. Here we only give a brief description and list some properties we use. We refer to [\cite=S] and [\cite=K] for more details.

Let f be an [formula] function. If Ω is a Borel subset of [formula], we define the oscillation of f over Ω by the difference of essential supremum and essential infimum of f over Ω:

[formula]

If Bε(x) denotes the ball of radius ε about the point x, then we get a measurable function x  →  (f, Bε(x)). The function have the following properties.

Let [formula] with g  ≥  0, ε > 0, and S be a Borel subset of [formula]. Then

[formula],

[formula],

[formula].

Proof: See [\cite=S] Proposition 3.2. [formula]

Take 0 < α < 1 and ε0 > 0. We define the α-seminorm of f as:

[formula]

We will consider the space of the functions f with bounded α-seminorm, namely:

[formula]

and equip Vα with the norm:

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the L1 norm. This space will not depend on the choice of ε0. With the [formula] norm, [formula] is a Banach space; moreover according to Theorem 1.13 in [\cite=K], the unit ball in [formula] is compact in L1.

Let [formula]; then:

[formula] provided ε0  ≤  1.

There exists a ball [formula] such that [formula].

Proof: See [\cite=S] Proposition 3.4 and Lemma 3.1. [formula]

To prove Theorem A we need one more ingredient, the so-called Lasota-Yorke's inequality, which will be proved in Section 6. This inequality provides an upper bound on the action of the Perron-Frobenius operator on the elements on [formula]. Such an operator will be defined on the subspace [formula] with a potential given by the inverse of the determinant of the induced map. We will denote it as P̂f. We will prove that:

[formula]

where η < 1 and D <   ∞  . This, plus the compactness in L1 of the unit ball of [formula], will allow us to invoke the ergodic theorem of Ionescu-Tulcea and Marinescu [\cite=ITM] (see also [\cite=K], Theorem 3.3), to conclude that there exists a unique (greatest) invariant probability measures μ which is absolutely continuous with respect to ν on [formula] and which decomposes into a finite number of cyclic disjoint measurable sets upon which a certain power of the map is mixing.

Proof of Theorem A:

Recall that R is given in Assumption 3. We construct a induced system (,T̂). Denote [formula]. Let T̂:  →   be the first return map of T, so that T̂(x) = T(x) if [formula], otherwise T̂(x) = Ti + 1(x) = Ti1Tj(x) if x∈T- 1jR, where i is the smallest positive integer such that Ti1Tj(x)∉R. We denote [formula], and similarly ĝ(x) = g(x) if [formula] and [formula] if otherwise. Let [formula] be the conditional measure of the Lebesgue measure ν. We may still think that [formula] is a Lebesgue measure with () = 1.

Let P be the Perron-Frobenius operator of T with the potential function log g(x), i.e.

[formula]

Then let P̂ be the Perron-Frobenius operator of T̂ with the potential function log ĝ(x).

By Proposition [\ref=LYineq] in the next section we have the Lasota-Yorke's inequality for the induced system (,T̂). So T̂ has an absolutely continuous invariant probability measure [formula] on [formula] with density function [formula] that has finitely many ergodic components.

We extend [formula] to M to get an invariant measure of T. Recall [formula], and let Rn = T- n1R0 for n > 0. By Remark [\ref=Rmk3a], [formula]. So we have [formula]. We extend [formula] to R to get a density function h on M. That is, if h is defined on [formula], then for [formula], we let

[formula]

It is easy to see that h  ≥  0 and Ph = h on M. Let μ be the measure on M with density h. Clearly, μ is invariant under T and has the same number of ergodic components as [formula] does.

Next, we show that μM is finite if [formula]. Since μ is invariant, we have

[formula]

where we assume that in addition to T- 11R  ⊂  U1, R has K' - 1 preimages in [formula], where K'  ≤  K. Take summation from i = n to infinity, we get

[formula]

Note that [formula] since [formula], and then note that the Jacobian of T- 1j is less than or equal to 1. We have

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Now we prove the last part of the theorem. By Proposition [\ref=properties2](ii), there is a ball [formula] such that [formula] for some constant h*. By our assumption, there exists Ñ > 0 such that [formula]. So for any x∈M, there is [formula] such that TÑy0 = x. Since [formula] is bounded above, we have g*: =  inf {g(y): y∈M} > 0. Hence, for every x,

[formula]

In this case, we can use a similar method as for ([\ref=upperbound]) to get

[formula]

This ends the proof. [formula]

A Lasota-Yorke type inequality

Let R be as in Assumption 3. Denote T̂ij = Ti1Tj and Uij  =  T̂- 1ij(R0) = T- 1jRi for i > 1 and [formula]. So if [formula], then Uil is undefined for any i > 0 and U0l = Ul. Clearly, Uij  ⊂  Uj for all i > 0 and [formula] are pairwise disjoint.

There exists 0 < ε6  ≤  ε5 such that for any ε0  ≤  ε6, ε  ≤  ε0, x∈M,

[formula]

where λ is given by Assumption 3(b).

Proof: Note that the sets [formula], [formula], are pairwise separated. So by Assumption 3(b) and the definition λ in ([\ref=lambda]) we only need prove that there exists ε6 > 0 such that for any given j, for any x in the ε6-neighbourhood of T- 1jR0, if 0 < ε  ≤  ε0  ≤  ε6, then

[formula]

Take

[formula]

where ε3 is given by Assumption 3(c).

Recall that Ns is also given by Assumption 3(c). Reduce ε6 if necessary such that for any x, the ball B(1 - s)ε6(x) intersects at most one connected component of the set {T̂- 1ijBε6(∂R0),0 < i  ≤  N,1 < j  ≤  K}. We also require ε6 small enough such that for any 1 < j  ≤  K, 1  ≤  i  ≤  Ns, the part [formula] are close to an (m - 1) dimensional plane.

Take ε and ε0 such that 0 < ε  ≤  ε0  ≤  ε6 .

We first consider the case 1  ≤  i  ≤  Ns. Note that [formula]. The volume of the latter is close to γm - 1((1 - s)ε0)m - 1  ·  2sε = 2sγm - 1ε(1 - s)m - 1εm - 10. So [formula] is close to [formula]. Hence, by Assumption 3(b), we know that it is less than [formula].

Now we consider the case that i  ≥  Ns.

Let [formula]. we have [formula].

For each i, we take a partition [formula] satisfying Assumption 4(c) with n = i and   ≤  ε5. Denote [formula], [formula], Aijk  =  T̂- 1ijAik and Aijk' = T̂- 1ijAik'. Then we let

[formula]

By abusing notations, we may also think that A and A' are the unions of the sets they contain.

By the fact

[formula]

and Assumption 4(c), we know that

[formula]

Denote [formula]. Note that by Assumption 4(c), [formula]. Since i  ≥  Ns, by Assumption 3(c), we have

[formula]

So if Aijk∈A, then [formula], and therefore Aijk  ⊂  Bε0(x). That is,

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

By ([\ref=nu1])-([\ref=nu3]), we get

[formula]

This is ([\ref=2sum]), the formula we need show. [formula]

Assume that T:M  →  M satisfies Assumption 1-4, and T̂:  →   is the reduced system with respect to [formula]. Then there exist η  <  1 and D <   ∞   such that for any [formula], we have [formula] and

[formula]

for all ε0 sufficiently small.

Proof: Take ζ > 0 such that for any ε  ≤  ε4,

[formula]

where c and J, ε4 and are given in Assumption 4(a) and (b) respectively.

Recall that by Assumption 3(b), [formula]. Take b > 0 such that [formula], where K' is the number of preimages of p for the map T. Recall also that ε1,ε2, ε4 and ε6 are given in Assumption 1(b), 3(b) and 4(b) and Lemma [\ref=proposition1] respectively. Take ε0  ≤   min {ε1,ε2,ε4,ε6} such that

[formula]

Denote

[formula]

Recall that GU(x,ε,ε0) is given by ([\ref=GU]) in Assumption 3(b). Note that if ε0 is small, then [formula] and [formula] are disjoint. Also, by ([\ref=lambda]) and Lemma [\ref=proposition1], we know that

[formula]

Then we take

[formula]

By ([\ref=G<lambda]), G(ε,ε0)ε-  α  ≤  λε-  α0. We have D <   ∞  .

Let ε  ≤  ε0.

By Proposition [\ref=properties1],

[formula]

Denote yij  =  T̂- 1ijx. We can choose N = N(ε) > 0 for each 0 < ε  ≤  ε0 according to Assumption 4(b).

For R(1)ij(x) with x∈T̂Uij, we first consider the case i  ≤  N(ε). By Assumption 4(a), (b) and ([\ref=chiep]), we have [formula] if d(Ti + 1yij,Ti + 1yij')  ≤  sε. Hence [formula] and [formula]. So we get

[formula]

If i > N(ε), then we must have x∈R0, and therefore

[formula]

By Assumption 4(b), for any x∈R0, [formula]. Hence,

[formula]

Since [formula] for any integrable function f, we have

[formula]

As for R(2)ij(x), if i  ≤  N(ε), then we have

[formula]

Hence by the same method as in [\cite=S], we get that

[formula]

If i  ≥  N(ε), then [formula], and

[formula]

Again, by Assumption 4(b) it is bounded by [formula]. So we have

[formula]

We may assume that [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=properties2](i) and ([\ref=falphanorm]) we have that [formula] and [formula] respectively. So by ([\ref=osc(pf)]), ([\ref=R1]) and ([\ref=R2]), we get

[formula]

Now the result follows by the choice of η and D in ([\ref=xib]) and ([\ref=DD]). [formula]
