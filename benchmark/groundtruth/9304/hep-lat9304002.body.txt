Comment on "Antiferromagnetic Potts Models"

Wang, Swendsen and Kotecký (WSK) [\cite=WSK] have recently proposed an elegant Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating the antiferromagnetic q-state Potts model on a finite graph G. It goes as follows: Choose at random two distinct "colors" [formula]; freeze all the spins taking values ≠  α,β, and allow the remaining spins to take value either α or β. The induced model is then an antiferromagnetic Ising model, which can be updated by any legitimate algorithm (for example, the Swendsen-Wang algorithm [\cite=Swendsen-Wang] or Wolff's single-cluster variant [\cite=Wolff_89a]).

At zero temperature the antiferromagnetic q-state Potts model reduces to the equal-weight distribution on q-colorings of G, and the WSK algorithm becomes: independently for each connected cluster of α  -  β spins, either leave that cluster as is or else flip it (interchanging α and β).

WSK studied their algorithm numerically for (among other cases) the q = 3 model at T = 0 on square lattices of linear size L = 4,8,16,32,64 with periodic boundary conditions. They claimed that the autocorrelation time was τWSK  ≈  7 independent of L, while the autocorrelation time of a single-spin-flip algorithm increased approximately as τSSF  ≈  0.32L2.

If the (exponential) autocorrelation time of a Monte Carlo algorithm is finite, then in particular that algorithm must be ergodic. However, WSK did not give any proof of the ergodicity of their algorithm at T = 0. (The ergodicity at T  ≠  0 is trivial.) Here we show that in fact the algorithm is not ergodic at T = 0 for q = 3 on periodic lattices of size 3m  ×  3n where m,n are relatively prime. For q  ≥  4 and/or other lattice sizes or boundary conditions, the ergodicity at T = 0 is an open question.

Consider the configurations shown in Figure [\ref=fig1] for a 3  ×  3 periodic lattice. For any choice of α,β, the sites colored α  -  β form a single connected cluster, so the only possible moves in the WSK algorithm are global permutations of the colors. On the other hand, configurations (a) and (b) are not related by a global permutation, since in (a) the bands of constant color run northeast-southwest while in (b) they run northwest-southeast. It follows that the WSK algorithm is nonergodic.

Next consider the configurations of Figure [\ref=fig1] repeated periodically on a 3m  ×  3n lattice. If m,n are relatively prime, then the sites colored α  -  β form a single connected band winding around the lattice, and the argument goes through unchanged. If m,n are not relatively prime, then the sites colored α  -  β form several disjoint connected bands, and the ergodicity is an open problem.

We remark that these configurations are completely frozen under any single-spin-update algorithm, because each spin is surrounded by neighbors of both colors. So any such algorithm is also nonergodic. The same holds for q = 4 on lattices 4m  ×  4n, and for q = 5 on lattices 5m  ×  5n. For q  ≥  6, the single-spin-update algorithm is easily seen to be ergodic on any square lattice [\cite=Jerrum_private]; more generally, this holds on an arbitrary graph G for q  ≥   max  deg G  +  2.

We also remark that the WSK algorithm for q = 3 is nonergodic on the planar graph of [\cite=Even_book].

To see these nonergodicities numerically requires some care:

(a) One must study the model not only at T = 0, but also at temperatures T approaching zero; then one will see the autocorrelation time growing without limit.

(b) One must measure an observable that distinguishes between the ergodic classes. For example, in the above situation one could use [formula] at momenta k  =  (2π / 3,  ±  2π / 3). It is not clear which observables might be sensitive to any possible nonergodicities at other values of q and L.

It is an open question whether there exist efficient algorithms for simulating the antiferromagnetic Potts model at zero temperature for q = 3,4,5 (more generally, for q  <   max  deg G  +  2). Jerrum [\cite=Jerrum_private] has pointed out that it is unlikely that such algorithms (with polynomially bounded autocorrelation time measured in CPU units) can exist for arbitrary graphs G and fixed q: indeed, the existence of such an algorithm for q = 5 would permit one to ascertain with high probability the 3-colorability of an arbitrary degree-4 graph, which is impossible if NP ≠   RP [\cite=NP_RP].
