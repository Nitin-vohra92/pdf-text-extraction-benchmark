INTRODUCTION

The minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is one of the most interesting extensions of the standard model of the electroweak interactions (SM) [\cite=SMOK]. Although the SM, a gauge theory based on a spontaneously broken SU(2)  ×  U(1) describes successfully all observed phenomena, it leaves several theoretical questions unanswered. Some of these problems, such as the hierarchy problem, could be solved by supersymmetry (SUSY) [\cite=HK] [\cite=N]. Unfortunately, no supersymmetric particle has been detected, and we do not even know if SUSY has anything to do with the real world. However, if SUSY is realized in nature, it could be possible to detect supersymmetric signals through radiative effects.

Several analysis of SUSY radiative corrections already exist in the literature (see, for example, [\cite=BFGH] [\cite=DHY] [\cite=MDKH] [\cite=PGS1] [\cite=PGS2] and references therein). In this paper, we focus our attention on universal and full one loop radiative corrections to the partial width Γ(τ  →  eν) and the masses of the W and Z gauge bosons in different renormalization schemes. Sleptons and -inos (gauginos and higgsinos) will be included in the analysis. The phenomenological bounds

[formula]

will be respected. In the -ino sector, we assume the GUT relation

[formula]

The charged sleptons of each family are supposed to be degenerate in mass. Their mass is related to the sneutrino mass through

[formula]

where tan (β) is the ratio of the v.e.v. of the Higgs giving mass to the up quarks and the v.e.v. of the Higgs giving mass to the down quarks. We do not consider squark contributions, but they can easily be included: Once their masses and mixing angles are given, one just adds their (universal) contributions δMsquarksW and δMsquarksZ to the given results. As we will see in sec. 4, Γ(τ  →  eν) is not affected by squark contributions.

This paper is organized as follows: In section 2, radiative corrections to the W mass are computed in the popular (α,Gμ,MZ) scheme. In section 3, we consider radiative corrections to the Z mass in the [formula] scheme. Clearly, some steps in these directions have already been done (see, for example [\cite=BFGH]). However, analyses including process dependent contributions (i.e. vertex and box diagrams, as well as external wave function renormalization effects), which could be important [\cite=PGS1] [\cite=PGS2] are, to my knowledge, still missing. In section 4, we say a few words on τ decays, and finally, section 5 will be devoted to the discussions and conclusions.

RADIATIVE CORRECTIONS TO MW

Suppose we are given the fine structure constant α, the Fermi constant Gμ and the mass of the Z boson MZ. Then, at tree-level, the following relation holds [\cite=CH]:

[formula]

After inclusion of radiative corrections, eq.([\ref=masawz]) will be modified, but it still holds for bare quantities. Let us now introduce

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

After substituting the bare quantities MoW, MoZ, αo and Goμ in eq.([\ref=masawz]) and doing some algebra, we find

[formula]

δSUSYα, δSUSYμ, δSUSYZ and δSUSYZ are given by

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where δNSEμ(SUSY) is a process-dependent contribution which depends on me, mμ, the selectron masses and mixing angles, the smuon masses and mixing angles, tan (β), and the -ino masses and mixing-matrices. The formulæ for Πγ(k2), ΠW(k2), Πγ(k2) and δNSEμ(SUSY) can be found in the literature [\cite=GS1] [\cite=GS2] and will not be listed here. The universal contributions to the mass shift [formula] are given by

[formula]

the non-universal contributions are given by

[formula]

and the full contributions read

[formula]

In fig.1, we show the universal (fig.1.a) and full (fig.1.b) contributions to δMW for tan (β) = 2 and me = mμ = mτ  =   50 GeV. The masses of the charged sleptons are given in eq.([\ref=masal]). The blank regions are phenomenologically excluded by the mass limit MΨ+  ≥   45 GeV. comparison of fig.1.a and fig.1.b shows that the non-universal contributions turn out to be small.

In the main range of the allowed (μ,M) space the full corrections (fig.1.b) lie between ~  60 and ~  120 MeV, mainly due to the universal contributions (eq.([\ref=wun])), which are about one order of magnitude bigger than the non-universal contributions (eq.([\ref=wnoun])). Similar analyses, with heavier sleptons, show that the mass shift decreases as the sfermions become heavier. For example, for me = mμ = mτ  =   200 GeV and tan (β) = 2, the full corrections lie between ~   - 10 and ~  50 MeV (in the main range of the allowed (μ,M) space). In this case, the non-universal contributions turn out to be very small. They are not bigger than 20 MeV in the whole allowed space, and not bigger than 10 MeV in a wide region. These mass shifts lie bellow the present experimental uncertainty ΔMW  =   250 MeV . However, MW will be measured with an accuracy of ~  100 MeV in the near future and thus, the experimental uncertainty and SUSY mass shifts will become comparable, provided the sparticles are light enough and squarks have been included in the analysis.

RADIATIVE CORRECTIONS TO MZ

Suppose now that we are given the fine structure constant α, the Fermi constant Gμ and the ratio of the masses of the W and the Z bosons, [formula]. Then, at tree-level, the following relation holds:

[formula]

As in the previous section, eq.([\ref=masazc]) will get modified when radiative corrections are included, but it still holds for bare quantities. Substituting bare quantities in eq.([\ref=masazc]), we find (see also [\cite=CPM])

[formula]

where s2  =   sin (θ). The universal contributions to [formula] are given by

[formula]

the non-universal contributions are given by

[formula]

while the full contributions read

[formula]

In fig.2, (δMSUSYZ)UNIV (fig.2.a) and (δMSUSYZ)FULL (fig.2.b) are displayed for tan (β) = 2 and me = mμ = mτ=50 GeV. The masses of the charged sleptons are given in eq.([\ref=masal]). The blank regions are phenomenologically excluded by the mass limit MΨ+  ≥   45 GeV. Comparison of fig.2.a and fig.2.b shows that, the non-universal contributions turn out to be small. As in the previous section, the universal contributions (eq.([\ref=zun])) are about one order of magnitude bigger the non-universal contributions (eq.([\ref=znoun])).

The full mass shifts (fig.2.b) lie between ~   - 150 and ~   - 310 MeV in the main region of the allowed (μ,M) space. Similar analyses show that these mass-shifts decrease for heavier sleptons, e.g., for me = mμ = mτ=200 GeV and tan (β) = 2, the radiative corrections lie between ~  30 and ~   - 110 MeV (in the main range of the allowed (μ,M) space). As in the previous section, the non-universal contributions are found to be small. For light sleptons, these mass shifts are bigger than the present experimental error ΔMZ = 20 MeV [\cite=PPDB]! Unfortunately, at tree-level MZ can only be predicted with a precision of ~   670 MeV. This tree-level error is due to the present experimental uncertainty ΔMW  =   250 MeV. However, for light sparticles, SUSY mass-shifts and the tree-level uncertainty will become comparable in the future, once MW is measured with an accuracy of ~   100 MeV and squarks have been included in the analyses.

τ decays

Let us now say a few words on τ decays. The τ lifetime, ττ, which can be derived from direct measurements of the impact parameter, can also be calculated from the measured branching ratio

[formula]

where Γ(τ  →  eν) (electroweak radiative corrections are included, [\cite=WMAS]) is given by

[formula]

and f(x) = 1 - 8x + 8x3 - x4 - 12x2 log (x). Since both results for ττ should agree, it is expected that

[formula]

holds. However, eq.([\ref=gamamutau]) may be affected by non-electroweak corrections. Supersymmetric corrections to eq.([\ref=gamamutau]) can be included by introducing a new Fermi constant Gτ,

[formula]

where δSUSYτ  =  δSUSYμ(μ  ↔  τ). Combining eq.([\ref=gamanu]) and eq.([\ref=gtau]), we find

[formula]

Thus, if supersymmetric corrections are included, the partial width Γ(τ  →  eν) reads

[formula]

and Rτ (eq.([\ref=rtau])) will deviate from 1. Supersymmetric corrections to Rτ, i.e.,

[formula]

where δNSEτ(SUSY) is a process-dependent contribution which depends on me, mτ, the selectron masses and mixing angles, the stau masses and mixing angles, tan (β), and the -ino masses and mixing-matrices, will arise if mτ  ≠  mμ (and [formula], eq([\ref=masal])). Thus, Rτ is sensitive to mass splittings between the μ and the τ (and between the smuon and the stau). Notice that there are no universal contributions to δRSUSYτ. Furthermore, as already pointed out in the introduction, Rτ is not affected by squark contributions. Combining eqs.([\ref=gamamutau]), ([\ref=gtauren]), ([\ref=gammaok]) and ([\ref=drsusy]), we find

[formula]

and

[formula]

Substituting the updated (and preliminary) data [\cite=MD]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

in eq.([\ref=rtau]) and eq.([\ref=gammaok]), we find

[formula]

Let us now turn to the numerical analysis. In fig.3, δNSE(SUSY), (  =  ,) is displayed for μ =  - 50 GeV, M =  100 GeV and tan (β) = 2. The masses of the charged sleptons are given in eq.([\ref=masal]). By combining eq.([\ref=drsusy]) and the results in fig.3, we easily obtain the value of δRτ, which turns out to be small (|δRτ|  ≤  0.25%). Similar analyses show that |δNSE(SUSY)| (and thus, |δRSUSYτ| and |δΓ(τ  →  eν)SUSY|) decrease as |μ| and |M| increase.

I would not like to conclude this section without saying a few words on the τ-decay puzzle. For the averages mτ = 1784.1+ 2.7- 3.6 MeV and ττ = (0.305  ±  0.006)10- 12 sec, [\cite=PPDB] the experimental branching ratios for τ decays where found to be smaller than the theoretical predictions by a factor 0.95  ±  0.02. Several attempts have been made to solve this puzzle with help of new physics [\cite=WJS] [\cite=WHTS] [\cite=GHK]. Supersymmetric contributions to Γ(τ  →  eν), and thus, to B(τ  →  eν) are too small to solve the τ puzzle. However, the most recent measurements of the τ mass and lifetime (eqs.([\ref=newmt]) and ([\ref=newtt]), see also ref.[\cite=MD]) seem to resolve these discrepancies.

CONCLUSIONS

Supersymmetric one loop corrections to the partial width Γ(τ  →  eν) and the masses of the W and Z gauge bosons have been calculated. All the contributions (i.e. universal and non-universal) have been taken into account. Γ(τ  →  eν) is only affected by non-universal contributions, which turn out to be very small.

The mass shifts δMSUSYW (δMSUSYZ) where found to lie bellow the present experimental (tree-level) errors, but in the future they might become comparable to these uncertainties, once MW is measured with a precision of ~   100 MeV. When the top quark mass will be known and squarks have been included in the analyses, SUSY might produce visible signals through both, MW and MZ mass shifts, which go in opposite directions. Thus, a deviation of the standard model prediction for MW (in the (α,Gμ,MZ) scheme) from the measured value MW and a deviation, in opposite direction, of the standard model prediction for MZ (in the (α,Gμ,MW / MZ) scheme) from the measured value MZ could be an indication for new physics (not necessarily supersymmetry), even if the deviations are not big. The sign and size of these deviations would contain valuable information.

For light sparticles, the computed mass shifts are dominated by universal contributions, which, are about one order of magnitude bigger than the non-universal contributions (we have found a small region, easily explorable at LEP II, where the non-universal contributions are about 30 % of the universal contributions), while for heavier sparticles, both, the universal and the non-universal contributions turn out to be small (I have checked that this also holds for tan (β)  ≠  2). The fact that (δMSUSYW)NON - UNIV ((δMSUSYZ)NON - UNIV) is not big can also be seen by combining eq.([\ref=wnoun]) (eq.([\ref=znoun])) and the results displayed in fig.3.
