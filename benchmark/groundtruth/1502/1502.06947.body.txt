Canal Surfaces According to Parallel Transport Frame in Euclidean Space [formula]

Introduction

A canal surface is defined as envelope of a non-parameter set of spheres, centered at a spine curve γ(t) with radius r(t): When r(t) is a constant function, the canal surface is the envelope of a moving sphere and is called a pipe (tube) surface. Canal surfaces have wide applications in CAGD, such as construction of blending surfaces, shape reconstruction, transition surfaces between pipe surfaces (see, [\cite=FS], [\cite=SB], [\cite=WB]). Most of the literature on canal surfaces within the CAGD context has been motivated by the observation that canal surfaces with rational spine curve and rational radius function is rational, and it is therefore natural to ask for methods which allow one to construct a rational parametrization of canal surfaces from its spine curve and radius function. The developable surface plays an important role in CAGD. A national question is when the canal surface is developable. It is well known that, at regular points, the Gaussian curvature of a developable surface is identically zero. In [\cite=XFS] it has been proved that developable canal surface is either a cylinder or a cone.

The canal surface can be considered as a generalization of the classical notion of an offset of a plane curve. In [\cite=FN] and [\cite=FN1], the analysis and algebraic properties of offset curves are discussed in detail. In [\cite=C], do Carmo discussed some geometrical features of pipe surfaces. Moreover, by using pipe surfaces, do Carmo proved two very important theorems in differential geometry concerning the total curvature of space curves, namely Fenchel's theorem and the Fary-Milnor theorem.

The well-known surfaces such as tori, Dupin cyclides (ring, spindle and horned) in [\cite=S] and pipe surfaces in [\cite=MPSY] are the special cases of the canal surfaces.

A surface M in Euclidean space [formula] is called a Weingarten surface if there is a smooth relation U(k1,k2) = 0 between its two principal curvatures k1 and k2. If K and H denote respectively the Gauss curvature and the mean curvature of M, U(k1,k2) = 0 implies a relation Φ(K,H) = 0. The existence of a non-trivial functional relation Φ(K,H) = 0 on a surface M parameterized by a patch [formula] is equivalent to the vanishing of the corresponding Jacobian determinant, namely [formula] Also, if a surface satisfies a linear equation with respect to K and H, that is, aK + bH = c, [formula], ((a,b,c)  ≠  (0,0,0)), then it is said to be a linear Weingarten surface in [\cite=RY].

The Frenet frame is constructed for the curve of 3-time continuously differentiable non-degenerate curves. But, curvature may vanish at some points on the curve. That is, the second derivative of the curve may be zero. In this situation, we need an alternative frame in [formula]: Therefore in [\cite=B], Bishop defined a new frame for a curve and he called it Bishop frame which is well defined even if the curve has vanishing the second derivative in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. In [\cite=B] [\cite=KB] the advantages of the Bishop frame and the comparison of Bishop frame with the Frenet frame in Euclidean 3-space were given . In Euclidean 4-space [formula], we have the same problem for a curve like being in Euclidean 3-space. That is, one of the i - th (1 < i < 4) derivative of the curve may be zero. In this situation, we need an alternative frame.

In [\cite=GBGEY] using the similar idea authors considered such curves and construct an alternative frame. They gave parallel transport frame of a curve and they introduced the relations between the frame and Frenet frame of the curve in 4-dimensional Euclidean space [formula]. They generalized the relation which is well known in Euclidean 3-space for 4-dimensional Euclidean space [formula].

In [\cite=BABO] authors considered canal surfaces imbedded in an Euclidean space of four dimensions. They investigated the curvature properties of these surface with respect to the variation of the normal vectors and curvature ellipse. They also gave some special examples of canal surfaces in [formula]. Further, they gave necessary and sufficient condition for canal surfaces in [formula] to become superconformal.

In the present study, we consider canal surfaces imbedded in Euclidean 4-space [formula] with the spine curve γ given with parallel transport frame in [formula]

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives some basic concepts of the Frenet  frame and Parallel Transport frame of a curve in [formula] Also this section provides some basic properties of canal surfaces in [formula] and the structure of their curvatures .Section 3 tells about the canal surfaces in [formula] according to parallel transport frame. We also obtain some curvature conditions of these type of canal surface.

Basic Concepts

Let [formula] be a unit speed curve in the Euclidean space [formula], where I is interval in [formula]. Then the derivatives of the Frenet frame of γ (Frenet-Serret formula);where [formula] is the Frenet frame of γ and κ, τ and σ are principal curvature functions according to Frenet frame of the curve γ, respectively.

In [\cite=GBGEY], authors used the tangent vector T(s) and three relatively parallel vector fields M1(s), M2(s), and M3(s) to construct an alternative frame. They called this frame a parallel transport frame along the curve γ. Then they gave the following theorem for a parallel transport frame.

[\cite=GBGEY] Let [formula] be a Frenet frame along a unit speed curve [formula] and [formula] denotes the parallel transport frame of the curve γ. The relation may be expressed as
