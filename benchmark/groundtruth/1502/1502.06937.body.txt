Introduction

For a positive integer n let [formula]. Denote by [formula] the real space on n  ×  n hermitian matrices. For [formula] let [formula] be the n eigenvalues of A, counted with their multiplicities. Let [formula] and let [formula] be the trace of A. Denote by [formula] the group of permutation matrices. In a short note [\cite=Lid50] Lidskii announced the following result: Let [formula]. Then (A + B) - (A) is in the convex hull spanned by P(B), where P∈Pn. This fact is equivalent to the result that (A + B) - (A) = O(B) for some doubly stochastic matrix O. That is, (A + B) - (A) is majorized by (B) [\cite=HLP52]. Since [formula] the result of Lidskii is equivalent to the inequalities

Preliminary results on hermitian pencils

Fix [formula]. Then [formula] is called a hermitian pencil. The n eigenvalues of A(z) are algebraic functions satisfying the equation det (αIn - A(z)) = 0. These eigenvalues are multivalued functions on [formula], each one with n branches at most, which are locally analytic except at a finite number of points [formula]. Furthermore, at each [formula] A(z) has exactly K = K(z) distinct eigenvalues [formula], and each eigenvalue γi(z) has a fixed mulitplicity Mi = Mi(z) for i∈K. Moreover, |Z|  ≤  n(n - 1). See [\cite=MoF80] [\cite=Fri81].

For [formula] the matrix A(t) is hermitian. We arrange its eigenvalues in a decreasing order

[formula]

Hence [formula] satisfy the equation det (λIn  -  A(t)) = 0, and they are analytic on [formula]. Furthermore

[formula]

Note

[formula]

We now recall a well known perturbation formula for eigenvalues of A(z) at z = 0:

Assume that [formula]. Suppose furthermore that A has exactly l∈[n] distinct eigenvalues of multiplicities [formula]:

[formula]

Assume that [formula]. Then it is possible to arrange the eigenvalues of the pencil A(z) = A + zB for |z| < r, where r is small, as [formula] such that

[formula]

Assume that

[formula]

Then νmi - 1 + j(A,B),j∈[ni] are the eigenvalues of the hermitian matrix nij = k = 1 arranged in the decreasing order for i∈[l]. In particular, it is possible to choose an orthonormal system of eigenvectors of A satisfying [\eqref=eigvectA] such that [formula] for j∈[n].

The proof of this lemma follows from a well known perturbation formula for an eigenvalue α(x) of F + xG, where [formula] and α(0) is a geometrically simple eigenvalue of F [\cite=Kat82]. This perturbation formula is elementary [\cite=Fri78]. This lemma is also a simple consequence of Rellich's theorem [\cite=Rel69]. We now summarize the above result in the following known theorem:

Rellich's theorem [\cite=Rel69] states that there exists a connected open set [formula] containing [formula], such that A(z) has n analytic eigenvalues [formula] and the corresponding analytic eigenvectors [formula] in Ω. Furthermore, [formula] are real and [formula] are orthonormal for [formula].

Recall the Ky Fan charaterization of the sum of the first k-eigenvalues of [formula] [\cite=Fan49]. Let Fk,n be the set of all k orthonormal vectors [formula] in [formula]. That is, [formula] for i,j∈[k]. Then

[formula]

Note that for k = n we have the equality [formula] for each [formula]. Equality in [\eqref=kyfanchar] holds if and only if [formula] is an invariant subspace of A corresponding to the first k eigenvalues of A.

A characterization of the equality case

Proof.  Let Il be an interval as in Theorem [\ref=difforeigpen]. Let [formula] for [formula]. Then for t∈Il one has:

[formula]

Since [formula] is an orthonormal basis in [formula] Ky Fan inequality yields [formula]. As [formula] are analytic in [formula] and continuous on [formula] it follows that for any real t0 < t1

[formula]

Choose t0 = 0,t1 = 1 to deduce the inequality [\eqref=wielandt1].

Assume that the equality [\eqref=wieleq] holds. Clearly, [formula]. For simplicity of notation we let [formula], where b0 = 0,br = 1. Fix τ∈(bl - 1,bl). Since φ(t) is analytic in (bl - 1,bl) we deduce that

[formula]

Since φ(t) is continuous on [formula] it follows that [formula] for t∈[0,1]. Let [formula]. Ky Fan's theorem claims that [formula] is an invariant subspace of B corresponding to the first k eigenvalues of B. Clearly [formula] is an invariant subspace of A(τ). Hence [formula] is an invariant subspace A of dimension k.

Let [formula] be the eigenvalues of the restriction of A(t) to [formula] for [formula]. Since [formula] are analytic in (bl - 1,bl) it follows that μi,l(t,τ) = λpj(τ)(t) for t∈(bl - 1,bl) and some integers [formula]. In view of [\eqref=lambdtmultip] we can assume that pj(τ) = ij for j∈[k] and each τ∈(bl - 1,bl). Fix τ∈(bl - 1,bl) and let [formula]. Then μj,l(t): = μj(t,τ) is λij(t) on (bl - 1,bl) for j∈[k]. Since each μj,l(t) and λij(t) are continuous on

[formula]

we deduce [\eqref=wieleq]. [formula]

Remarks and an open problem

We remark that in the case of k = 1 we can assume that r = 1. Indeed, on each [formula] the pencil Al(t) has one analytic eigenvalue λ1,l(t): = λi(l) + tλ1(B). Hence for two distinct l1,l2∈[r] either μ1,l1(t) is identically μ1,l2(t) or μ1,l1(t) - μ1,l2(t) is never zero. We do not know if in a general case we can always assume that r = 1 in Theorem [\ref=Wielineqeq]. (For that one needs to discuss only the case where r = 2.)

Assume that [\eqref=wieleq] holds. Then there exists a k dimensional subspace [formula], invariant under A and B such that the restriction of [formula] is spanned by the first k eigenvectors of B and by the eigenvalues [formula] of A. The following proposition gives necessary and sufficient conditions on the existence of such [formula]:

Let [formula] and let [formula] be integers. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

There exists a k-dimensional subspace [formula] satisfying the following properties:

[formula] is an invariant subspace of A spanned by k eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues [formula].

[formula] is an invariant subspace of B spanned by the eigenvectors corresponding to the first k eigenvalues of B.

There exist t1 > 0 and k integers [formula] such that

[formula]

Let [formula] be defined as in Lemma [\ref=pertform]. Then there exist k integers [formula] such that

[formula]

Proof.  1.⇒  2. Let A1,B1 be a restriction of A,B to [formula] respectively. Let [formula] be the eigenvalues of A1(t) = A1 + tB1 for [formula]. Assume that [formula] for some t1 > 0. Then μj(t) = λpj(t) for t∈(0,t1] and j∈[k]. As [formula] is an invariant subspace corresponding to λij(A),j∈[k] and λpj(A),j∈[k] we deduce the second part of [\eqref=wieleqt1]. Since

[formula]

we deduce the first part of [\eqref=wieleqt1].

2.⇒  3. Apply Theorem [\ref=Wielineqeq] to A and t1B. Note that λj(t1B) = t1λj(B) for j∈[n]. Let [formula]. Hence there exists t2∈(0,t1) such that [formula]. Let A1,B1,A1(t) be as above. Then μj(t) = λpj(t) for j∈[k]. In particular, [formula]. Use the second part of [\eqref=wieleqt1] to deduce [\eqref=nuABkid].

3.⇒  1. [\eqref=derlambi0+] yields that [formula]. [\eqref=difforeiglami+] implies that there exists an invariant subspace [formula] of A spanned by orthonormal eigenvectors [formula] corresponding to the eigenvalue λpj(A) for j∈[k] such that [formula]. The first equality in [\eqref=nuABkid] yields that [formula] is an invariant subspace of B corresponding to first k eigenvalues of B. The second equality in [\eqref=nuABkid] yields 1. [formula]

Observe that the condition 3. of Lemma [\ref=existU1] can be verified efficiently. Furthermore, given [formula] which satisfies the condition 1. of Lemma [\ref=existU1] then there exist [formula] and a maximal t1, possibly t1  =    ∞  , such that the condition 2. holds for t∈[0,t1] but not for t > t1.

Consider the following example. Assume that α1  >  α2  =  α3,β1  >  β2  ≥  β3. Suppose that [formula]. Consider the case k = 1 and i1 = 3. So [formula]. Then p1 = 2 and [formula].
