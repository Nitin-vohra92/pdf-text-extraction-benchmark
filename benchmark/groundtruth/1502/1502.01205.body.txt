Introduction

We study strictly locally convex plane curves. Recall that a regular plane curve [formula] in the plane [formula], where I is an open interval, is called convex if, for all s∈I the trace X(I) of X lies entirely on one side of the closed half-plane determined by the tangent line at X(s) ([\cite=dC]). A regular plane curve [formula] is called locally convex if, for each s∈I there exists an open subinterval I0  ⊂  I containing s such that the curve X|I0 restricted to I0 is a convex curve. Henceforth, we will say that a locally convex curve X in the plane [formula] is strictly locally convex if the curve is smooth (that is, of class C(3)) and is of positive curvature κ with respect to the unit normal N pointing to the convex side. Hence, in this case we have [formula], where X(s) is an arc-length parametrization of X. When [formula] is a smooth function defined on an open interval I, we will also say that f is strictly convex if the graph of f has positive curvature κ with respect to the upward unit normal N. This condition is equivalent to the positivity of f''(x) on I.

Suppose that X is a strictly locally convex curve in the plane [formula] with the unit normal N pointing to the convex side. For a fixed point P∈X, and for a sufficiently small h > 0, we consider the line [formula] passing through P + hN(P) which is parallel to the tangent line t of X at P and the points A and B where the line [formula] intersects the curve X. We denote by t1, t2 the tangent lines of X at the points A,B and by Q,A1,B1 the intersection points [formula], [formula], [formula], respectively.

We let LP(h), gP(h), jP(h) and kP(h) denote the length of the chord AB , the distance from the centroid G of the section of X cut off by [formula] to the line [formula], the distance from the centroid J of the triangle [formula] to the line [formula] and the distance from the centroid K of the triangle [formula] to the line [formula], respectively. Now, we consider SP(h) and TP(h) defined by the area of the region bounded by the curve X and chord AB, the area [formula] of triangle [formula], respectively. Then, obviously we have

[formula]

and we get ([\cite=KK4])

[formula]

It is well known that parabolas satisfy the following properties.

Proposition 1. Suppose that X is an open part of a parabola. Then we have the following.

1) For arbitrary point P∈X and sufficiently small h > 0, X satisfies

[formula]

2) For arbitrary point P∈X and sufficiently small h > 0, X satisfies

[formula]

3) For arbitrary point P∈X and sufficiently small h > 0, X satisfies

[formula]

4) For arbitrary point P∈X and sufficiently small h > 0, X satisfies

[formula]

Proof. For a proof of 1), see [\cite=S]. If we denote by V the point where the parallel line m through the point P to the axis of X meets the chord AB, then V is the mid point of AB and the point Q is on the line m with PV = PQ. This completes the proof of 2), 3) and 4). [formula]

Very recently, the first author of the present paper and Y. H. Kim showed that among strictly convex plane curves, the above area property (1.3) of parabolic sections characterize parabolas. More precisely, they proved as follows ([\cite=KK4]).

Proposition 2. Let X be a strictly convex curve in the plane [formula]. Then X is a parabola if and only if it satisfies (C): For a point P on X and a chord AB of X parallel to the tangent of X at P, the area of the region bounded by the curve and AB is 4 / 3 times the area of triangle [formula], that is,

[formula]

Archimedes showed that parabolas satisfy (1.3) ([\cite=S]). Actually, in [\cite=KK4] the first author of the present paper with Y. H. Kim established five characterizations of parabolas, which are the converses of well-known properties of parabolas originally due to Archimedes ([\cite=S]). For some properties and characterizations of parabolas with respect to the area of triangles associated with a curve, see [\cite=D] [\cite=KKKP] [\cite=KS] [\cite=Kr]. For the higher dimensional analogues of some results in [\cite=KK4], see [\cite=KK2] and [\cite=KK3].

In [\cite=KKP], using Proposition 1, D.-S. Kim et al. proved the following characterization theorem for parabolas with respect to the function gP(h). Proposition 3. Let X be a strictly locally convex plane curve in the plane [formula]. For a fixed point P on X and a sufficiently small h > 0, we denote by [formula] the parallel line through P + hN(P) to the tangent t of the curve X at P. We let gP(h) the distance from the center G of gravity of the section of X cut off by [formula] to the line [formula]. Then X is an open part of a parabola if and only if it satisfies for a fixed point P on X and a sufficiently small h > 0

[formula]

In [\cite=KKP], the distance from the center G of gravity of the section of X cut off by [formula] to the tangent t of X at P was denoted by dP(h). Hence, we see that dP(h) + gP(h) = h. In this article, we study whether the remaining properties of parabolas in Proposition 1 characterize parabolas. First of all, in Section 2 we prove the following:

Theorem 4. Suppose that X denotes a strictly locally convex plane curve in the plane [formula]. For a fixed point P on X and a sufficiently small h > 0, we denote by [formula] the parallel line through P + hN(P) to the tangent t of the curve X at P. Then we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Finally, with the aid of the characterization theorem of parabolas (Theorem 3 in [\cite=KK4]), in Section 4 we prove the following. Theorem 5. Suppose that X denotes a strictly locally convex C(3) curve in the plane [formula]. Then the following are equivalent.

1) For all P∈X and sufficiently small h > 0, X satisfies

[formula]

where λ(P) and μ(P) are some functions.

2) For all P∈X and sufficiently small h > 0, X satisfies

[formula]

3) X is an open part of a parabola. For the function kP(h), the similar argument as in the proof of Theorem 5 yields the following. Theorem 6. Suppose that X denotes a strictly locally convex C(3) curve in the plane [formula]. Then the following are equivalent.

1) For all P∈X and sufficiently small h > 0, X satisfies

[formula]

where λ(P) and μ(P) are some functions.

2) For all P∈X and sufficiently small h > 0, X satisfies

[formula]

3) X is an open part of a parabola. Remark. If we consider the distance δP(h) from the centroid of the triangle ΔPAB to the parallel line [formula] through the point P + hN(P) to the tangent t of a strictly locally convex curve X at P, then X always satisfies [formula] for all sufficiently small h > 0.

For some characterizations of parabolas or conic sections by properties of tangent lines, see [\cite=KKa] and [\cite=KKPj]. In [\cite=KK1], using curvature function κ and support function h of a plane curve, the second author of the present paper and Y. H. Kim gave a characterization of ellipses and hyperbolas centered at the origin.

Among the graphs of functions, Á. Bényi et al. proved some characterizations of parabolas ([\cite=BSV1] [\cite=BSV2]). In [\cite=R], B. Richmond and T. Richmond established a dozen necessary and sufficient conditions for the graph of a function to be a parabola by using elementary techniques. Throughout this article, all curves are of class C(3) and connected, unless otherwise mentioned.

Proof of Theorem 4

In this section, we prove Theorem 4. First of all, we need the following lemma ([\cite=KK4]) which is useful in the proof of main theorems.

Lemma 7. Suppose that X is a strictly locally convex C(3) curve in the plane [formula] with the unit normal N pointing to the convex side. Then we have

[formula]

where κ(P) is the curvature of X at P with respect to the unit normal N pointing to the convex side.

Now, we prove Theorem 4 as follows.

Let us denote by X a strictly locally convex C(3) curve in the Euclidean plane [formula]. We fix an arbitrary point P on X. Then, we may take a coordinate system (x,y) of [formula] such that P is the origin (0,0) and x-axis is the tangent line t of X at P. Furthermore, we may regard X to be locally the graph of a non-negative strictly convex function [formula] with f(0) = f'(0) = 0. Then N is the upward unit normal.

Since the curve X is of class C(3), the Taylor's formula of f(x) is given by

[formula]

where 2a = f''(0) and f3(x) is an O(|x|3) function. Noting that the curvature κ of X at P is given by κ(P) = f''(0) > 0, we see that a is positive.

For a sufficiently small h > 0, the line [formula] through P + hN(P) and orthogonal to N(P) is given by y = h. We denote by A(s,f(s)) and B(t,f(t)) the points where the line [formula] meets the curve X with s < 0 < t. Then we have f(s) = f(t) = h. The tangent lines t1 and t2 to X at A and B intersect at the point Q = (x0(h),y0(h)) with

[formula]

[formula]

and they meet the x-axis (the tangent to X at P) at B1(s - h / f'(s),0) and B2(t - h / f'(t),0), respectively.

Noting LP(h) = t - s, one gets

[formula]

and

[formula]

Hence we obtain

[formula]

and

[formula]

where we use

[formula]

On the other hand, it follows from Lemma 5 in [\cite=KS] that

[formula]

Together with (2.7) and Lemma 7, this shows that

[formula]

and hence from (2.8) we also get

[formula]

This completes the proof of Theorem 4.

Proofs of Theorems 5 and 6

In this section, in order to prove Theorem 5 we use the main result of [\cite=KK4] (Theorem 3 in [\cite=KK4]) and Theorem 4 stated in Section 1.

First, we prove

Lemma 8. Suppose that X is a strictly locally convex C(3) curve in the plane [formula] with the unit normal N pointing to the convex side. Then we have

[formula]

where αP(h) is defined in (2.9).

Proof. Just as in the proof of Theorem 4 in Section 2, for an arbitrary point P on X we take a coordinate system (x,y) of [formula] so that (2.2) holds with f(0) = f'(0) = 0 and 2a = f''(0) > 0. Then, for sufficiently small h > 0, we put f(t) = h with t > 0 and we denote by A(s(t),h) and B(t,h) the points where the line [formula] meets the curve X with s = s(t) < 0 < t. Then we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Noting h = f(t), one obtains from (3.3) that

[formula]

Therefore, it follows from (3.2) that

[formula]

Together with (2.9), this completes the proof of Lemma 8. [formula] It is obvious that any open part of parabolas satisfy 1) and 2) in Theorem 5.

Conversely, suppose that X is a strictly locally convex C(3) curve in the plane [formula] which satisfies for all P∈X and sufficiently small h > 0

[formula]

where λ(P) and μ(P) are some functions. Using Theorem 4, by letting h  →  0 we see that

[formula]

which shows that μ(P) = 1 and [formula]. Therefore, the curve X satisfies for all P∈X and sufficiently small h > 0

[formula]

Now, using Lemma 8 we get the following. Lemma 9. Suppose that X denotes a strictly locally convex C(3) curve in the plane [formula] which satisfies (1.5) for all P∈X and sufficiently small h > 0. Then for all P∈X and sufficiently small h > 0 we have

[formula]

Proof. It follows from (1.5) and (2.7) that

[formula]

Together with Lemma 8, this yields

[formula]

By integrating (3.9) with respect to h, we get for some constant C = C(P)

[formula]

Thus, Lemma 7 completes the proof of Lemma 9. [formula]

Finally, we prove Theorem 5 as follows. It follows from (1.2) and SP(0) = 0 that by integrating (3.7) we get

[formula]

Hence, together with (1.1) and (3.7), (3.11) yields that for all P∈X and sufficiently small h > 0

[formula]

Thus, it follows from Proposition 2 that X is an open part of a parabola. This completes the proof of Theorem 5. In order to prove Theorem 6, with the help of (2.8) we may use the similar argument as in the proof of Theorem 5.
