Parity proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem based on the Lie algebra E8

Introduction

The exceptional Lie algebra E8 plays a role in a number of physical theories such as supergravity and heterotic string theory[\cite=e8refs]. Here we show that its system of root vectors can be used to exhibit a large number of "parity proofs" of the Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem[\cite=KS1967] ruling out the existence of noncontextual hidden variables theories as viable alternatives to quantum mechanics. The fact that the root vectors of E8 could be made to serve this end was pointed out, in different ways, by Lisonek et. al.[\cite=lisonek1] and by Ruuge and van Oystaeyen[\cite=ruuge]. However the proof in [\cite=ruuge] is unrelated to parity proofs, while [\cite=lisonek1], though proving that 21940 parity proofs exist, does not list even a single example of such a proof. The purpose of this paper is to supplement the observations in [\cite=lisonek1] and [\cite=ruuge] by (a) presenting a general framework (namely, the "basis table") within which the parity proofs can be exhibited, (b) showing how the symmetries of E8 can be exploited to simplify the search for its parity proofs, (c) providing an overview of the parity proofs found by our search and, finally, (d) presenting a few concrete examples of the proofs in order to convey some feeling for their variety and intricacy.

Parity proofs of the KS theorem are appealing because they take no more than simple counting to verify. What a parity proof is, and how it accomplishes its goals, are matters that will be explained later in this paper.

We make a few remarks about E8, to shed light on the way it is used in this paper. For us E8 is simply a collection of 240 vectors (namely, its roots) in a real 8-dimensional Euclidean space. These vectors define the vertices of a semiregular polytope discovered by Thorold Gosset[\cite=coxeter] and sometimes described by the symbol 421. The vectors have eight real coordinates that can be chosen in a variety of ways. A particularly judicious choice, for our purposes, is the "triacontagonal representation" of Coxeter and Shepard[\cite=leonardo]. In this representation the coordinates of the vectors are chosen in such a way that if only the first two coordinates are retained (which amounts to projecting the vectors orthogonally from eight dimensions down to two), the tips of the vectors lie at the vertices of eight regular triacontagons lying on concentric circles. Such a projection is shown in Fig.10 of [\cite=leonardo]. The eight rings of thirty points are easily picked out in the figure, while the dense network of lines connecting pairs of points are projections of the 6720 edges of Gosset's polytope.

Two slight modifications of this figure will convert it into the Kochen-Specker diagram of E8: the first is that only one member of each pair of diametrically opposite vertices should be retained, since one is concerned with rays rather than vectors in a proof of the KS theorem; and the second is that the line segments corresponding to the edges of Gosset's polytope should be replaced by new segments that connect only pairs of vertices that correspond to orthogonal rays. Rather than construct such a diagram, we later present a "basis table" that conveys essentially the same information in a more useful form. The basis table is simply a listing of all the bases (i.e., sets of eight mutually orthogonal rays) in the system. Because there are 2025 bases, and this is too large a number to display explicitly, we list just a few bases and give a simple set of rules (based on the symmetries of E8) for generating all the bases from the ones shown. It should be pointed out that the entire basis table can in fact be generated from any one of its elements by applying products of all possible powers of three basic symmetry operations of E8. The basis table is of central importance in this paper because all the parity proofs of E8 can be exhibited as subsets of it.

We say a few words about the broader area in which this work is set, to provide some perspective. After their initial discovery in two-qubit systems[\cite=Peres1991] [\cite=Kernaghan1994] [\cite=Cabello1996] [\cite=Pavicic2010] [\cite=Waegell2011c], parity proofs were discovered in three-[\cite=KP1995] [\cite=Waegell2012a] and higher-qubit[\cite=DiVin] [\cite=Waegell2013] systems, in systems of rays derived from the four-dimensional regular polytopes [\cite=Waegell2011a] [\cite=Waegell2011b] [\cite=Waegell2014] and the root systems of exceptional Lie algebras[\cite=ruugeE6] and, very recently, in a remarkably compact six-dimensional system of complex rays[\cite=Lisonek2013] in connection with which an experiment has also been reported[\cite=canas2014a]. Aside from revealing the many guises in which quantum contextuality can arise in spaces of different dimensionality, parity proofs are interesting because they have a variety of applications: they can be used to derive state-independent inequalities for ruling out noncontextuality[\cite=Cabello2008] [\cite=badziag] [\cite=kirchmair] [\cite=bartosik] [\cite=amselem] [\cite=moussa] and Bell inequalities for identifying fully nonlocal correlations[\cite=Aolita]; they have applications to quantum games[\cite=Ambrosio], quantum zero-error communication[\cite=Cubitt], quantum error correction[\cite=Error] [\cite=raussendorf] and the design of relational databases[\cite=Abramsky2012]; they can be used to witness the dimension of quantum systems[\cite=guhne2014]; and they underlie surprising phenomena such as the quantum pigeonhole effect[\cite=aharonov2014] [\cite=yu2014] [\cite=rae2014]. Although the KS theorem is theoretically compelling, it has been argued[\cite=mayer] [\cite=kent] [\cite=barrett] that the finite precision of real measurements nullifies practical attempts at verifying it. There is some debate about this matter[\cite=mermin], but it should be mentioned that methods of establishing contextuality that are not open to this objection have been proposed[\cite=Klyachko] [\cite=Liang] [\cite=Bengtsson] [\cite=YuOh]. Spekkens[\cite=spekkens] has recently expanded upon the conditions that must be satisfied by realistic experiments that claim to rule out noncontextual ontological models. It has been argued in [\cite=emerson] that contextuality is the source of the speedup in many quantum information protocols. This brief survey is far from complete, but it serves to show that the KS theorem and quantum contextuality are at the heart of many current research efforts.

The plan of this paper is as follows. Section [\ref=sec:2] introduces the triacontagonal representation of the 120 rays derived from the root vectors of E8, and shows how their symmetries can be exploited to give an efficient construction of their basis table. Section [\ref=sec:3] points out some interesting substructures within E8 that have been shown in the past to give rise to proofs of the KS theorem. Section [\ref=sec:4] reviews the notion of a parity proof and shows how the triacontagonal representation of E8 facilitates the identification of subsets of its bases, of distinct symmetry types, that each house a large number of parity proofs. The significance of these smaller subsets is that they are far more easily searched for parity proofs than the entire system. After giving an overview of the parity proofs we found among the different subsets of bases, we present a few examples of the parity proofs that illustrate their important features. Section [\ref=sec:5] concludes with a discussion of our results.

The E8 system: rays and bases

The 240 root vectors of E8 come in 120 pairs, with the members of each pair being the negatives of each other. Choosing just one member from each pair yields the 120 rays associated with E8. Each ray has eight real coordinates, which may be chosen in a variety of ways. We use a coordinatization due to Richter[\cite=richter], which differs from the one introduced earlier by Coxeter and Shepard[\cite=leonardo]. Let [formula] and let [formula] be the golden ratio. Define a,b,c and d as the positive numbers satisfying the equations

[formula] [formula] .

For any integer n, let [formula] and define the quantities

r1 = a / c9 , r2 = b / c9 , r3 = c / c9 , r4 = d / c9 , r5 = a / c3 , r6 = b / c3 , r7 = c / c3 , r8 = d / c3 .

The 120 rays |i〉 ([formula]) are then defined as

|n + 1〉  =  (r1ω2n,r4ω22n,r6ω14n + 1,r7ω26n + 1) for 0  ≤  n  ≤  14 |n + 16〉  =  (r4ω2n, - r1ω22n,r7ω14n + 1, - r6ω26n + 1) for 0  ≤  n  ≤  14 |n + 23〉  =  (r7ω29 + 2n, - r6ω19 + 22n, - r1ω24 + 14n,r4ω18 + 26n) for 8  ≤  n  ≤  14 |n + 38〉  =  (r7ω29 + 2n, - r6ω19 + 22n, - r1ω24 + 14n,r4ω18 + 26n) for 0  ≤  n  ≤  7 |n + 38〉  =  (r6ω29 + 2n,r7ω19 + 22n,r4ω24 + 14n,r1ω18 + 26n) for 8  ≤  n  ≤  14 |n + 53〉  =  (r6ω29 + 2n,r7ω19 + 22n,r4ω24 + 14n,r1ω18 + 26n) for 0  ≤  n  ≤  7 |n + 61〉  =  (r8ω2n, - r5ω22n, - r3ω14n + 1,r2ω26n + 1) for 0  ≤  n  ≤  14 |n + 76〉  =  (r5ω2n,r8ω22n, - r2ω14n + 1, - r3ω26n + 1) for 0  ≤  n  ≤  14 |n + 83〉  =  (r2ω29 + 2n,r3ω19 + 22n, - r8ω24 + 14n, - r5ω18 + 26n) for 8  ≤  n  ≤  14 |n + 98〉  =  (r2ω29 + 2n,r3ω19 + 22n, - r8ω24 + 14n, - r5ω18 + 26n) for 0  ≤  n  ≤  7 |n + 98〉  =  (r3ω29 + 2n, - r2ω19 + 22n,r5ω24 + 14n, - r8ω18 + 26n) for 8  ≤  n  ≤  14 |n + 113〉  =  (r3ω29 + 2n, - r2ω19 + 22n,r5ω24 + 14n, - r8ω18 + 26n) for 0  ≤  n  ≤  7 ,

with each ray being an 8-component column vector whose (real) components are given by the real and imaginary parts of the four complex numbers listed for it. We will use 〈i| to denote the 8-component row vector that is the transpose of |i〉.

Let us denote by the letters A,...,H each consecutive set of 15 rays (thus A denotes rays 1-15, B rays 16-30, etc.). If we add to each group of 15 rays all their negatives, we get groups of 30 vectors whose first two coordinates define the vertices of regular triacontagons in the plane, with the triacontagons corresponding to the eight letter groups being concentric to one another. This is just the triacontagonal representation of the roots of E8 (or of the vertices of Gosset's polytope 421) mentioned in the introduction. Although the coordinates we have introduced for the rays are identical to those of Richter[\cite=richter], our numbering of the rays is a bit different from his (in essence, we have swapped some of his triacontagons and rotated some of them relative to the others for convenience in the presentation of some of our results).

A straightforward calculation shows that each of the 120 rays is orthogonal to 63 others and that the rays form 2025 bases. Each ray occurs in 135 bases and its only companions in these bases are the 63 other rays it is orthogonal to. We will denote this system of rays and bases by the symbol 120135-20258, with the subscript on the left indicating the multiplicity of each of the rays (i.e., the number of bases it occurs in) and that on the right the number of rays in each basis. The product of the numbers in the left half of the symbol equals the product on the right, as it should. The basis table of E8 (i.e., the complete list of all its bases) is saturated, by which we mean that all the orthogonalities between its rays are represented in it. Because of this, the basis table is completely equivalent to the Kochen-Specker diagram of its rays. However it has the great advantage over the Kochen-Specker diagram that it is easy to interpret and work with.

Later we will encounter other systems of rays and bases having a high degree of symmetry, and the notation we have introduced above is easily modified to deal with such cases. For example, a system of 45 rays that forms 15 bases, with 30 of the rays being of multiplicity 2 and the other 15 of multiplicity 4 can be represented by the symbol 302154-158 (again the sum of the products of each number on the left with its subscript equals the product of the number and its subscript on the right). The parity proofs we will present later, which are subsets of the basis table, can also be described by symbols of this kind.

We now present the basis table of E8. Figure 1 shows 15 bases that contain all 120 rays once each. The entire basis table can be derived from these 15 bases by permuting the rays in them in the manner we now describe. Let V be the permutation of order 9 with the cycle decomposition V = (1 5 9 13 53 40 82 105 11)(2 91 90 55 28 42 54 119 49)(3 47 38 66 31 30 41 103 12)(4 10 51 89 117 106 87 27 36)(6 93 97 101 86 71 48 69 113)(7 14 79 67 33 29 64 32 100)(8 95 99 45 44 92 112 63 78)(15 104 34 46 109 77 118 107 85)(16 120 98 60 61 75 18 35 68)(17 73 20 24 59 96 58 57 94)(19 23 76 52 84 56 21 25 37)(22 74 116 108 115 72 62 50 70)(65 80 88 102 83 110 114 81 111)(26 43 39) and W the permutation of order 15 with the cycle decomposition W = (1 [formula] 15)(16 [formula] 30)(31 [formula] 45)(46 [formula] 60)(61 [formula] 75)(76 [formula] 90)(91 [formula] 105)(106 [formula] 120), where the dots signify all the integers between the two extremes. Let each basis in Figure 1 be assigned the label (0,0,l), where the first two labels are fixed and the third varies, in integer steps, from 0 to 14. Then any other member of the basis table, which is assigned the label (n,m,l) with 0  ≤  l,n  ≤  14 and 0  ≤  m  ≤  8, can be generated by applying suitable powers of W and V to one of the bases in Fig.1, as described by the equation (n,m,l)  =  WnVm(0,0,l). The number of bases that can be generated in this way is 15  ·  9  ·  15  =  2025, which is the entire basis table.

In Figure [\ref=tab2] we show the 9 blocks of bases obtained by applying all powers of V to the block of Figure [\ref=tab1]. The remaining blocks of bases can be obtained by applying powers of W to these nine blocks. Since an application of W amounts, for the most part, to increasing the ray numbers by one, these other blocks are easily written down.

The construction we have given of the basis table can be compressed even further by introducing a permutation of order 15, which we will term U, whose cycle decomposition is given by the eight columns of numbers obtained by aligning the bases in Fig.[\ref=tab1] and reading down them vertically. Then all the bases can be generated from the first basis of Fig.[\ref=tab1] by applying powers of the permutations U,V and W to it, as described by the equation

[formula]

with 0  ≤  l  ≤  14,0  ≤  m  ≤  8 and 0  ≤  n  ≤  14. This procedure works even if an arbitrary basis is substituted for (0,0,0) as the seed basis. The three-index label (n,m,l) serves as a convenient shorthand for the basis if one wishes to avoid listing all its rays.

Instead of describing U,V and W by the permutations they perform on the rays, one can represent them by the 8  ×  8 orthogonal matrices

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

as one can easily check by applying them to the column vectors representing the rays and verifying that they produce the desired permutations.

We can construct all the symmetries of E8 by looking at the mappings of a fixed basis on to all the bases of the system. Let [formula] and [formula] be two bases and let [formula] be some permutation of the numbers in the latter. Consider the orthogonal transformation

[formula]

where ni∈(0,1) for 1  ≤  i  ≤  8. Keeping the basis [formula] fixed and letting [formula] vary, the number of transformations of the form ([\ref=eq3]) that one can construct is the number of possibilities for the variable basis (2025) times the number of permutations of the variable basis labels (8!) times the number of possibilities for the signs of the terms (28). However an investigation shows that only 1 / 30 of the 8! permutations of the basis labels lead to symmetries of E8, so the total number of its symmetries is [formula], which equals the number of 192  ·  10! given by Coxeter[\cite=coxeter] as the order of the symmetry group of Gosset's polytope 421.

Substructures within the E8 system

The E8 system contains a number of interesting substructures that yield proofs of the KS theorem. These substructures have all been studied in the past, and we discuss each of them briefly.

Two interesting substructures are the Lie algebras E7 and E6, whose roots/rays can be exhibited as subsets of the roots/rays of E8. The rays of E7 are simply the 63 rays orthogonal to any ray of E8; these rays lie in a 7-dimensional space, and if one adjoins to them all their negatives, one gets the 126 roots of E7. The 63 rays of E7 form 135 bases, with each ray occurring in 15 bases. This system can be described by the symbol 6315-1357, and it is saturated. The basis table of E7 is easily extracted from that of E8 by picking out the 135 bases involving a particular ray and then dropping that ray from these bases. This construction shows that the symmetry group of E7 is a subgroup of index 240 of that of E8; thus its order is 192  ·  10! / 240, which agrees with the figure of 8  ·  9! given by Coxeter for the order of the symmetry group of the associated 7-dimensional polytope 321. The rays of E7 can be used to give a proof of the KS theorem. Because the system is saturated, the proof requires showing that it is impossible to assign noncontextual 0 / 1 values to the rays in such a way that each of the 135 bases has just a single ray assigned the value 1 in it, and this is easily done using a "proof-tree" argument. An alternative proof of the KS theorem based on the rays of E7 has been given by Ruuge[\cite=ruugeE6].

If one picks the 36 rays orthogonal to any two nonorthogonal rays of E8, one gets the rays of the E6 system, and the roots of E6 are these 36 rays along with their negatives. The rays of E6 do not form even a single basis (i.e., a set of six mutually orthogonal rays) and so do not yield a proof of the KS theorem. This was pointed out by Ruuge[\cite=ruugeE6], who discussed how two rotated copies of E6 could be superposed to give a system of rays that yields a proof of the KS theorem.

Another interesting subsystem of E8 is what we will term a Kernaghan-Peres (KP) set[\cite=KP1995]. Such a set consists of 40 rays that form 25 bases, with each ray occurring in five bases, so that its symbol is 405-258. Kernaghan and Peres[\cite=KP1995] constructed such a set as the simultaneous eigenstates of five sets of mutually commuting observables of a system of three qubits. The caption to Fig.[\ref=tab3] explains how KP sets can be extracted from the bases of E8 and the figure gives an example of a set constructed using this procedure. The caption to Fig.[\ref=tab3a] gives a simple procedure for obtaining all the parity proofs in a KP set[\cite=Waegell2012a] and the figure gives one example of each of the three types of parity proofs contained in the KP set of Fig.[\ref=tab3] (see the beginning of Sec. [\ref=sec:4] for an explanation of the notion of a parity proof). Finally, Fig.[\ref=tab3b] gives an example of a "pseudo" KP set that closely resembles a KP set but is not one, and in fact yields no proofs of the KS theorem.

Parity proofs in the E8 system

We will say that a set of projectors in a Hilbert space of even dimension furnishes a parity proof of the KS theorem if the projectors form an odd number of bases in such a way that each projector occurs in an even number of the bases (a basis is any set of mutually orthogonal projectors that sums to the identity, and we will allow for the possibility that the projectors are not all of the same rank). Such a set of projectors proves the KS theorem because it is impossible to assign noncontextual 0 / 1 values to them in such a way that the sum of the values assigned to the projectors in any basis is always 1. Because an even-odd conflict makes this assignment impossible, we refer to this type of proof as a parity proof. In [\cite=lisonek1] it was pointed out that the E8 system has 21940 parity proofs in it, but no examples of such proofs were given. In this section we would like to describe a straightforward method we used to discover a large number of these proofs, and then present a few examples of them. These proofs are far more numerous and varied than those in the KP sets we know to be contained in the E8 system.

We will discuss only critical parity proofs, where by a critical proof we mean one that ceases to provide a proof of the KS theorem if even a single basis is dropped from it. We restrict ourselves to critical proofs to avoid redundancy, since many noncritical proofs can often be reduced to the same critical proof. We present just a few of the more striking critical proofs we found from among the staggeringly large number that exist.

In Sec. [\ref=sec:2] we introduced the letters A to H for each consecutive set of 15 rays of E8. These letters can be used to attach an 8-letter label to each basis. For example, the basis 1 7 62 66 70 73 107 111 would have the label AAEEEEHH. Viewed in terms of their labels (which specify how the rays of a basis are distributed over the triacontagons of E8), the bases fall into 33 families with distinct triacontagon profiles. We made the important discovery that if one looks at only the bases of a particular family, the parity proofs housed by them could be unearthed with relatively little effort. In the following subsections we discuss the parity proofs we found in a few of the families.

Type 1 Bases and their parity proofs

Let us term bases with the profile AAEEEEHH, BBFFFFGG, CCEEGGGG or DDFFHHHH as Type 1 bases. The 15 bases with each of these profiles give a parity proof that can be characterized by the symbol 154302-158. Figure [\ref=tab4] shows the proof given by the bases with profile AAEEEEEHH (the proofs given by the other three profiles are very similar).

The Type 1 bases give rise to two other types of parity proofs if bases of different profiles can be combined. These proofs are characterized by the symbols 154702-258 and 454502-358 and there are 12 versions of each (all structurally identical, but involving different rays). The properties of the three different types of parity proofs made up only of Type 1 bases are summarized in the first row of Figure [\ref=tab5].

Type 2 Bases and their parity proofs

We will term bases with the profile AABBEEFF or CCDDGGHH as Type 2 bases. There are 30 bases with each of these profiles, and therefore 60 Type 2 bases in all. These bases contain just the two types of parity proofs shown in the second row of Figure [\ref=tab5].

Figure [\ref=tab6] shows two 362-98 proofs of this class that seem very similar at first sight, but are subtly different from one another. While both proofs involve 36 rays that occur two times each over 9 bases, the proof on the left always has the following pairs of rays occur together over the bases: (1,66), (7,62), (16,86), (22,87), (9,84), (19,64), (21,76), (14,89), (17,82), (2,72), (11,61), (27,77), (29,74), (26,81), (4,79), (12,67), (24,69) and (6,71). Thus each of these pairs of rays can be regarded as defining a two-dimensional subspace, or a rank-2 projector, and the proof can be reinterpreted as involving 18 rank-2 projectors that each occur twice over nine bases; this situation can be captured in the symbol 1822-94, where the superscript on the left indicates the rank of the projectors and the subscript their multiplicity, and the subscript on the right that each of the 9 bases is made up of four rank-2 projectors. For the proof on the right, 18 of the rays can be paired into the rank-2 projectors (1,16), (62,87), (75,80), (70,90), (82,72), (65,85), (67,77), (11,26) and (6,21), while the remaining 18 rays are associated with rank-1 projectors; thus the symbol of this proof can be written as 9221812-96, with the superscripts and subscripts on the left having the same meaning as before and the subscript on the right indicating that each basis is made up of six projectors (four of rank-1 and two of rank-2).

Type 3 Bases and their parity proofs

Type 3 bases are those with the profile EEFFGGHH. There are 45 such bases involving 60 rays, and they form a 606-458 system. Despite their small number, the bases of this system are a fecund lot and give rise to 20 different types of parity proofs, each of which can come in hundreds to thousands of versions. The symbols of all the possible proofs are shown in the third row of Figure [\ref=tab5]. When the different versions of each of the proofs are taken into account, the total number of distinct proofs is 700,326. Figure [\ref=tab7] shows a 66124422-218 proof of this class involving rays of multiplicity 6,4 and 2.

Type 4 Bases and their parity proofs

Type 4 bases have the profile AABBCCDD. There are 75 such bases involving 60 rays, and they form a 6010-758 system. We have found over 400 different types of parity proofs in this system, with each coming in anywhere from scores to thousands of versions. We show just nine of these proofs in the last row of Figure [\ref=tab5]. There are no critical proofs with more than 27 bases in this class. The number of proofs in this class greatly exceeds those in the previous three classes combined. Figure [\ref=tab8] shows a 362-98 proof of this class and Fig. [\ref=tab8a] shows a rather unusual proof consisting entirely of rank-2 projectors.

We end by presenting a proof of this class, in Fig.[\ref=tab9], that involves 34 rays (2 of multiplicity four and 32 of multiplicity two) that occur over 9 bases. This proof is more economical than the best proofs found earlier in 8 dimensions, which involve 36 rays occurring an even number of times over 11 bases[\cite=KP1995] or 81 bases[\cite=cabello2005] or 9 bases[\cite=Waegell2012a] . As explained in the caption to Fig.[\ref=tab9], this proof can also be interpreted as involving 26 rank-1 projectors and 4 rank-2 projectors that occur over 9 bases.

Discussion

We pointed out at the end of Sec. [\ref=sec:3] that the bases of E8 have 33 different triacontagon profiles. Our survey of parity proofs in Sec. [\ref=sec:4] covered just four of these profiles, so it is clear that we have left the vast majority of the proofs untouched. The basis table of E8 presented in this paper serves a convenient template for displaying all the proofs in this gargantuan system.

It is interesting that the triacontagonal representations of both the 600-cell and Gosset's polytope lead to some of the simplest parity proofs contained in them. In the case of the 600-cell, the vertices project into four triacontagons, with two of the triacontagons uniting to yield a parity proof of 15 bases and the other two triacontagons yielding the complementary proof (i.e, one involving all the rays not present in the earlier proof). In the case of Gosset's polytope, the vertices project into eight triacontagons, and one can construct a parity proof (actually four different proofs) by picking out 15 bases that each span all the triacontagons in the same way. The great virtue of the triacontagonal representation for Gosset's polytope (or E8) is, of course, that it allows the bases to be organized into smaller families that are more easily searched for their parity proofs. Although we have unearthed only a tiny fraction of the parity proofs present in E8, their variety and intricacy seems to exceed that in any of the other systems we have studied to date. This is doubtless due to the large basis table of E8 (at 2025 bases, a record) and its huge symmetry group (of over 108 elements).

A comment should be made about the experimental measurements needed to realize the bases of E8, on which all the parity proofs of this paper depend. It might be asked if the projectors corresponding to some of the bases can be realized as simultaneous eigenstates of commuting three-qubit observables that are tensor products of Pauli operators of the individual qubits. While this is true of some of the bases, such as the ones we have identified as the Kernaghan-Peres sets, it is not true of the bases in general. The simplest way of generating an arbitrary basis from the computational basis is by following Eq.([\ref=eq1]) and applying a product of the appropriate powers of the three unitary operators U,V and W. Designing efficient quantum gates for these operators is an interesting problem that we will not take up here. However it seems worth pursuing because a recent experiment[\cite=canas2014b] has successfully generated several KS sets in a three-qubit system and holds out the possibility of eventually generating the more complex sorts of KS sets considered here.

It was pointed out in [\cite=badziag] that any KS proof can be converted into an inequality that is satisfied by any noncontextual hidden variables theory but violated in measurements carried out on an arbitrary quantum state. It might be asked what the extent of the violation is for the parity proofs discussed in this paper. The answer to this question has already been given in an earlier work of ours[\cite=Waegell2011b]. We showed there that for any basis-critical parity proof (i.e., one which fails if even a single basis is omitted from it), the upper bound of the inequality for any noncontextual hidden variable theory is B - 2 (where B is the number of bases in the proof) whereas quantum mechanics predicts the value of B. This gap of 2 between the values predicted by hidden variable theories and quantum mechanics is a universal feature of all basis critical parity proofs. Thus the present proofs do not offer any particular advantage, from this point of view, over the many similar proofs[\cite=Waegell2011c] [\cite=Waegell2012a] [\cite=Waegell2013] [\cite=Waegell2011b] [\cite=Waegell2014] we found earlier.

Gosset's polytope is the real representative of a complex polytope known as Witting's polytope[\cite=leonardo]. Coxeter[\cite=coxeter2] has carried out a systematic study of a large number of complex polytopes. It is possible that the ray systems derived from some of them might yield new proofs of the KS theorem. Whether this is true, and of what use it might be, are matters that remain to be explored.
