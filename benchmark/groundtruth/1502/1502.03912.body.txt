Fiberings of 3-manifolds with Torelli monodromy.

Introduction

One of Thurston's contributions to 3-manifold theory was to provide a complete description of all the surprisingly many different ways in which a 3-manifold M can fiber, [\cite=Thurstonnorm]. This is done by defining a semi-norm on [formula], similar to the Seifert genus of a knot, whose unit norm ball is a polyhedron. If an element of [formula] is dual to a fiber, then every other integer point of [formula] in the same cone over a facet of the polyhedron also determines a fibration.

The Torelli group of a surface S, T(S), is the subgroup of the mapping class group that acts trivially on homology. Using homological arguments it is not hard to show that when the monodromy is in the Torelli group, the genus of the fiber is as small as possible . Conversely, when a fiber has this smallest possible genus, namely [formula], the monodromy must be in the Torelli group.

This paper proves the following theorem, conjectured by Tom Church and Benson Farb, .

Suppose that a connected, orientable 3-manifold can fiber over the circle with pseudo-Anosov monodromy in the Torelli group. Of all the infinite ways M can fiber over the circle, the fibering with Torelli monodromy is unique up to isotopy.

When it exists, the fibering with Torelli monodromy is therefore in some sense canonical, being the unique fibering with minimal genus.

By another classic theorem of Thurston, [\cite=pA], M is hyperbolic iff the monodromy is pseudo-Anosov. This assumption also ensures that a Thurston norm ball of any finite radius is compact. There can therefore be only finitely many integer points of [formula] within or on the boundary of a ball. It follows that there are only finitely many different fibrations for any given genus. However, when the monodromy is not pseudo-Anosov, the Thurston semi-norm ball of any radius is not compact, and hence there can be infinitely many nonisotopic fibers with the same genus. An example of how to obtain countably many fibrations with nonisotopic fibers of the same genus is given in Example [\ref=example].

The basic outline of the proof Theorem [\ref=maintheorem] is as follows: Suppose there could be two fibrations of a hyperbolic manifold M, with fibers S1 and S2 and monodromies τ1∈T(S1) and τ2∈T(S2). A covering space of M is found, that retracts onto a covering space S3 of both S1 and S2. The assumption that the monodromies are in Torelli is used to show that different connected components of the lifts to S3 of curves from S1 and S2 are homologous. This gives a contradiction.

Unlike with 3-manifolds, that fiber in many different ways if they fiber at all, in Theorem 1.1 of [\cite=Salter], it was shown that if M is a surface bundle over a surface, whenever the monodromy is in the subgroup of the Torelli group generated by Dehn twists around separating curves (the "Johnson Kernel"), then the fibering is unique, unless it is a trivial product of two base spaces. A common theme is that, when the monodromy is in the Torelli group, the topology of the fiber determines the topology of the manifold to a large extent, which is used to obtain contradictions to the existence of fiberings. A survey of "fibering rigidity" results for 4-manifolds is given in [\cite=Rivin].

Proof of Theorem

Outline of paper. Subsection [\ref=notation] introduces some basic notation, conventions and definitions that will be used throughout the paper. Subsection [\ref=intersection] deals with maps between the homology of covering spaces, and the global structure of such covering spaces. In Subsection [\ref=translation], some consequences of hyperbolicity are established. Finally Subsection [\ref=final] uses local-to-global arguments to compute the homology of a covering space of M, thereby deriving the contradiction from which Theorem [\ref=maintheorem] follows.

Conventions and notations

A fiber in M determines a free homotopy class of surfaces in M, as well as an element of [formula] which is the class of the base space over which M fibers. When it does not cause confusion, the same notation will be used for a surface embedded in M representing the homotopy class and the fiber. By curve is meant here a free homotopy class of maps from the 1-sphere into a surface or 3-manifold that is not homotopic to a point. Curves are not necessarily simple, and will sometimes be assumed to pass through a basepoint. This basepoint in M is chosen to be in the intersection of S1 and S2. A curve will often be confused with the image in a surface or 3-manifold of a chosen representative of the homotopy class. All curves, surfaces and 3-manifolds are assumed to be oriented.

Let τ1 and τ2 be the infinite cyclic coverings [formula] and [formula]. Denote by T the smallest covering space of both Mτ1 and Mτ2; in other words, MT is the universal cover [formula] of M modulo the subgroup [formula]. The group π1(T) is not trivial because there are curves in the intersection of S1 and S2 in M. A curve will be said to lift to T if it is freely homotopic to a curve in the intersection [formula]. Informally, curves in T represent curves that are both in S1 and S2.

The reader should be warned that in what follows, we will be very relaxed about where a curve lives. Any two curves c1 and c2 in M that lift to T can be homotoped onto both of the fibers S1 and S2, and the same notation will be used for these curves in the fibers. Similarly, when a particular fundamental domain in S2, T, τ1 or τ2 is assumed, the same notation will be used for a curve in the fundamental domain and its projection to M or one of the fibers. It will always be stated in what space we are working, and all curves mentioned should be assumed to be in that space.

The covering space T

The 3-manifold T is a covering space of a manifold that retracts onto a surface, and therefore also retracts onto a surface, call it S3.

Maps between homology. The 3-manifold T is a covering space of τ1. If α is a curve in T homologous to β, the simplicial complex S in T bounded by α  -  β projects onto a simplicial complex in τ1 with boundary π(α) - π(β). A map on homology, from [formula] into [formula] is therefore obtained. Similarly with τ1 replaced by τ2. Since the monodromies are assumed to be in the Torelli group, the embeddings of the fibers in M induce isomorphisms of [formula] and [formula] with their images in [formula].

The next little argument will be used throughout the paper, so has been made into a lemma.

The diagram in Figure [\ref=commutative] commutes.

Two curves in T that project to homologous curves in τ1 are mapped to homologous curves in M by the inclusion map of [formula] into M. Since the curves came from T, the images in M represent curves in the image of the inclusion map of [formula] into M, whose pullbacks are also homologous in S2, because the inclusion map induces an isomorphism onto its image.

Diamonds. To understand the covering space T of M, note that a "diamond", as shown in Figure [\ref=diamonds], lifts rigidly to T. A diamond is the closure of a connected component of [formula]. It is not really a polytope, but a union of 3-manifolds of the form f  ×  I, where f is a subsurface of one of the fibers.

There is a fundamental domain of the covering T of M consisting of a union of diamonds. The monodromies correspond to translations of lifts of diamonds in T, and the deck transformation group is generated by deck transformations corresponding to powers of the monodromies τ1 and τ2. For simplicity, the translations of lifts of diamonds to T coming from the monodromies will also be denoted by τ1 and τ2. An example of a covering space T is illustrated in Figure [\ref=slant]. In this example, M is cut up into two diamonds, d1 and d2. The monodromy τ2 maps d1 to d2. A fundamental domain is given by connected components of lifts of the diamonds d1 and d2, and the deck transformation group is generated by τ1 and τ22 (Alternatively by τ21 and τ2, with fundamental domain d1 and τ1(d1)). When it is clear in what manifold we are working, the same notation will be used for a diamond and a connected component of its lift to T, which will also be called a diamond.

Pseudo-Anosov monodromies

This subsection is devoted to some consequences of the assumption that τ1 and τ2 are pseudo-Anosov. The next example illustrates a phenomenon that the pseudo-Anosov assumption on the monodromies rules out. This subsection is not strictly needed for the proof of Theorem [\ref=maintheorem], but helps to understand how the two fibers and monodromies are interrelated.

Let τ1 be a mapping class in the Torelli group that is not pseudo-Anosov and leaves a simple curve c on S1 invariant. There is then a torus T in M that intersects S1 along the curve c. Suppose S2 is obtained from S1 by Dehn twisting around T in a direction transverse to S1. The fibers are clearly non-isotopic, and since they have the same genus, both monodromies must be in the Torelli group.

In Example [\ref=example], we would like to argue that the fiberings are not really distinct in some sense, despite having non-isotopic fibers. The following formulation was suggested by N. Salter: In Example [\ref=example], S3 is an infinite cyclic covering space of both S1 and S2 obtained by cutting S1 or S2 along c and gluing together infinitely many copies. The fundamental group of S3 is a free group normally generated by the elements of [formula] or [formula]. The mapping class τ1 determines a deck transformation that acts on π1(S3) by the same outer automorphism class as τ2.

Suppose the deck transformation group of the cover S3 of S1 is generated by τk22 and the deck transformation of the cover S3 of S2 is generated by τk11.

When the monodromies τ1 and τ2 are pseudo-Anosov, τk11 and τk22 determine deck transformations acting on π1(S3) in different outer automorphism classes.

Put S1 and S2 in minimal position in M, and let F1 be a fundamental domain of the cover S3 of S1, and F2 a fundamental domain of the cover S3 of S2, as shown in Figure [\ref=milchschnitt]. By construction, the surface F1 has the boundary curves consisting of the multicurve m01 in the lift of the intersection of the fibers, and the multicurve m02: = τk22(m01), also in the lift of the intersection of the two fibers. Similarly, F2 has boundary curves consisting of m01 and m11: = τk11(m01).

If τk22 could determine the same outer automorphism of π1(S3) as τk11, then it must be that m11 is freely homotopic in [formula] to m02, as illustrated in Figure [\ref=milchschnitt]. The fundamental domains of the covers S3 of S1 and S3 of S2 could therefore be chosen to coincide. Since m01 is contained in the intersection of the fibers, both τk11 and τk22 map m01 to itself, contradicting the assumption that τ1 and τ2 are pseudo-Anosov.

Proposition [\ref=afterthought] does not require the monodromies to be Torelli.

Informally, the assumption that the monodromies are pseudo-Anosov is needed in the proof of Theorem to ensure that the fundamental domains of the covers S3 of S2 and S3 of S1 can not coincide. This is used to extend local properties of the fibers to all of S3, which then gives the contradiction that proves Theorem [\ref=maintheorem].

Lifts of curves are homologous in S3.

This subsection shows that the connected components of the lift of a curve to S3 are all homologous in S3. This is the main lemma from which Theorem [\ref=maintheorem] follows. The first step is to understand how "local" homology classes lift.

Let F be a fundamental domain of the cover T of M consisting of a union of diamonds.

Let c1 and c2 be two curves in M that can both be homotoped into F. If c1 and c2 are homologous in M, there are connected components of the lifts to T that are also homologous in T.

Since c1 and c2 both lift to T, each of c1 and c2 must be freely homotopic to curves in the fibers S1 and S2. By Lemma [\ref=lemmachen], the projections of c1 and c2 onto each of the fibers also gives homologous curves in the fibers.

The fundamental domain F retracts onto a subsurface contained in its boundary, so by projecting onto this subsurface, it is possible to make sense of intersection numbers of the curves c1 and c2. If c1 - c2 is not simple, resolve the points of intersection in the usual way, to obtain a multicurve homologous in F to c1 - c2. After resolving the points of intersection if necessary, a null homologous (in M) multicurve in ∂F is obtained. Let N be a submulticurve that is null homologous in M without any proper null homologous submulticurves. By construction, N lifts to T, and by Lemma [\ref=lemmachen], this lift projects to null homologous curves in each of the fibers.

It is clear that [formula] is locally separating in T, i.e. [formula] is either empty or is separating in di for any diamond in T. This is because the boundary of any diamond can be identified with a subsurface of S1 or S2. A separating multicurve in a surface cuts any subsurface it intersects into two or more pieces.

It remains to be shown that [formula] is globally separating in T. Let S  ⊂  T be a connected union of diamonds in which [formula] is separating in S and such that no further diamond can be attached to S without destroying this property. Since N and S are assumed to be oriented, it is possible to define the left side of [formula] and the right side of [formula]. By assumption, if a diamond dj is attached to S along its boundary, it is attached both to the left side of S and to the right side, as illustrated in Figure [\ref=doesnotlift].

As a consequence, there is a curve c in [formula] such that:

c intersects [formula] once.

c is a union of two arcs; one of which passes through a1 diamonds and is contained in the lift of the fiber S1, and the other passes through a2 diamonds and is contained in the lift of the fiber S2.

By construction, the curve c is the lift of a bouquet of curves in M, one of which, call it b1, is contained in S1, and the other, call it b2, is contained in S2. Also by construction, b1 intersects S2 a1 times, and b2 intersects S1 a2 times, where a1 and a2 can not both be zero.

In order to lift to T, it must be possible to homotope b1b2 into both S1 and S2. However, b1b2 can not be homotoped onto S1 because it has nonzero algebraic intersection number with S1, nor can it be homotoped into S2, for the same reason. The curve b1b2 therefore could not possibly lift to a curve in T. It follows that S is all of T, hence N is null homologous in T. Since this is true for any choice of N, it follows that any two connected components of the lifts of c1 and c2 contained in a lift of F must be homologous in T.

In order to be able to use Lemma [\ref=localtoglobal] to establish properties of lifts of homology classes, it is convenient to be able to forget about curves not contained in fundamental domains.

Any lift of a curve c1 to T is homologous in T to a union of curves, each of which is contained in a connected component of a lift of F.

Since c1 lifts to T, it must be freely homotopic into each of the fibers. It therefore has algebraic intersection number zero with each of the fibers. Homotope c1 into the fiber S2, and suppose F is a union of diamonds contained in [formula]. The representative of the free homotopy class corresponding to the fiber S2 can be chosen such that the lift of the subsurface of S1 on the boundary of F is connected.

The construction so far ensures that c1 does not intersect the lifts of the subsurface of S2 on ∂F, and has zero algebraic intersection number with every other connected component of the boundary. Let p1 and p2 be a pair of oppositely oriented points of intersection of c1 with the lift of a subsurface of S1 on the boundary of F, and let a be an oriented arc in this subsurface connecting p1 to p2. Cut the curve c1 at the points p1 and p2, and attach the arcs a and - a to obtain a union of curves homologous to c1 in T with fewer points of intersection with ∂F. This is called surgering the curve c1 along the arc a. Keep surgering along arcs until a union of curves homologous to c1 is obtained, each of which is contained in a connected component of a lift of F.

Lemmas [\ref=localtoglobal] and [\ref=fundamentaldomains] are now used to show that homology classes from the fibers lift to T.

Suppose τ1 and τ2 are pseudo-Anosov monodromies in the Torelli group, and c1 is a simple curve in S1 that lifts to S3. Any two connected components of the lift of c1 are homologous in S3. The same is true with S1 and S2 interchanged.

As a consequence of Lemma [\ref=fundamentaldomains], it is possible to assume without loss of generality that c1 is contained in F.

Let l1 be a connected component of the lift to S3 of a curve c1 in S1. The other connected components of the lift are in the orbit of l1 under the deck transformation τk22 of the cover S3 of S1. The curve c1 is freely homotopic in M to a curve in S2, because otherwise it could not lift to S3. However, since τ2 is a pseudo-Anosov mapping class of S2, τk22(l1) can not project to a curve freely homotopic to c1 on S2. Let c2 be the projection of τk22(l1) to S2. Since τ2 is in the Torelli group of S2, c2 is homologous to c1 in S2, and hence in M and S1 by Lemma [\ref=lemmachen].

The curve c2 can be homotoped into F because c1 can be, and deck transformations map fundamental domains to fundamental domains. By lemma [\ref=localtoglobal], there is a connected component l2 of the lift of c2 homologous in S3 to l1. Another connected component of the lift of the curve c2 is τ- k11(l2): = l3, where τk11 is the deck transformation of the cover S3 of S2. The curve l3 projects to a curve c3 in S1 homologous to c1 that can be homotoped into F. Also by Lemma [\ref=localtoglobal], l3 is homologous to l2. It follows that any two connected components of the lift of the curve c2 from S2 are homologous, and hence that any two connected components of the lift of c1 are homologous.

It will now be shown that Theorem [\ref=maintheorem] is a corollary of Lemma [\ref=welldefined].

As shown in the proof of Lemma [\ref=welldefined], any curve in T is homologous to a multicurve, each connected component of which is contained within the lift of a fundamental domain of the cover T of M consisting of a union of diamonds. Lemma [\ref=welldefined] then implies that the rank of [formula] is no more than the rank of [formula] or [formula], which is a contradiction.
