An Objective Definition for the Main Sequence of Star-Forming Galaxies

Introduction

The stellar mass and SFR of galaxies are fundamental quantities now being measured extensively, from low to the highest redshifts at which galaxies have been discovered. For star-forming (SF) galaxies the two quantities are tightly correlated with each other, to the extent that, following [\cite=Noeske07], such a correlation has got the designation of Main Sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies. In a series of seminal papers [\citep=Noeske07] [\citep=Daddi07] [\citep=Elbaz07] it was recognized that such tight correlation persists to at least redshift ~  2 with nearly constant slope and dispersion compared to the correlation followed by SF galaxies in the local Universe [\citep=Brinchmann04]. Many subsequent studies have followed, confirming the existence of a MS, all the way to at least z  ~  4 [\citep=Pannella09] [\citep=Peng10] [\citep=Rodighiero10] [\citep=Rodighiero11] [\citep=Rodighiero14] [\citep=Karim11] [\citep=Popesso11] [\citep=Popesso12] [\citep=Wuyts11] [\citep=Whitaker12] [\citep=Whitaker14] [\citep=Sargent12] [\citep=Kashino13] [\citep=Bernhard14] [\citep=Magnelli14]. Yet, slope, shape, dispersion and redshift evolution of the SFR- M *  correlation can vary quite dramatically from one study to another, with the logarithmic slope of the relation ranging from ~  0.4 up to ~  1 (see e.g. the compilation in [\cite=Speagle14]). In extreme cases, if galaxies are collected in a SFR-limited fashion, no appreciable MS is recovered and the SFR runs flat with stellar mass [\citep=Erb06] [\citep=Reddy06] [\citep=Lee13], a result dominated by Malmquist bias as at low stellar masses only galaxies with SFR above threshold are recovered [\citep=Rodighiero14].

One reason why the MS of one group may differ from that of another stems primarily from how galaxies are selected for being star forming. One may select them by a slightly mass-dependent color, picking blue cloud galaxies (as in P10), or using the BzK two-color selection [\citep=Daddi04] [\citep=Daddi07] [\citep=Pannella09], or the rest-frame UVJ selection [\citep=Williams09] [\citep=Whitaker12] [\citep=Whitaker14], or setting a minimum threshold for the specific SFR [formula] SFR/M *  [\citep=Karim11]. Ultimately, all these criteria cut out galaxies with low sSFR, but the threshold differ from one criterion to another, and in a manner that may depend on mass, SFR, reddening and redshift. Criteria that tend to select as SF massive galaxies with low (but detectable) SFR will return a flatter MS compared to criteria that would not qualify as SF the same galaxies. Clearly, the use of different criteria makes less comparable to each other the corresponding results and may fuel sterile debates as to which of such criteria should be preferable.

The importance of the MS comes from the fact that most stars in the Universe have formed in galaxies lying around it within about a factor of ~  2 in SFR. The mere existence of the MS, and its sharpness, indicate that there is order in nature, i.e., in the growth of galaxies, as opposed to mere stochasticity. It also implies that both the mass and SFR of high redshift galaxies must increase with time quasi-exponentially [\citep=Renzini09] [\citep=Maraston10]. The absolute value of the sSFR sets the clock of galaxy evolution (P10), setting the growth rate of individual galaxies and controlling their lifetime before they are quenched. The slope of the MS is directly connected to the (low-mass) slope of the mass function of star-forming galaxies, and if lower than unity would cause a runaway steepening of the mass function if not contrasted by a tuned rate of merging [\citep=Peng14]. Moreover, much interest there is on the relation between the MS and the specific rate of mass increase of the dark matter halos hosting them, a proxy of the rate of gas inflow fueling the SF activity [\citep=Bouche10] [\citep=Lilly13] [\citep=PengM14]. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the SFR distance from the MS can be used to identify galaxies that do not qualify as belonging to the MS, such as starburst outliers on one side and, on the other side of the MS, those that have started the quenching process and, while still star forming, are in transition towards pure passive evolution.

For all these reasons, a more objective definition of the MS of SF galaxies is in order: one which should not rely at all on such a pre-selection. In this paper we accordingly propose a definition of the MS and suggest it should be generally adopted. Stellar masses and SFRs can be measured in many different ways, e.g., for the SFR using several different indicators through the whole electromagnetic spectrum, and the choice will depend on the available data and on the redshift of the sample. We emphasize that we are not proposing a universal way of measuring SFRs (and masses), our goal is instead to objectively define the MS once the measurements have been made, whatever measurement procedures were used. Still, such objective definition for the MS should also help quantify the relative systematics of different SFR and mass diagnostics.

The 3D SFR-Mass-Number Plots

We select galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 release [\citep=Abazajian07] for lying at 0.02 < z < 0.085 and having a reliable spectroscopic redshift. Having excluded AGNs, this has provided a sample of ~  240,000 galaxies for which SFRs have been estimated from their Hα flux and their stellar masses from SED fits, following the same procedures as in [\cite=Brinchmann04] and P10, with the exception that there SFRs were derived from SDSS DR4 release. Galaxies were weighted by the V / V max method for masses below the completeness limit. This dataset is ideal for our purposes, because of its exquisite statistics, highly reliable redshifts and homogeneity in SFR and mass estimates. However, the same procedure can be repeated at higher redshifts as well, though other SFR diagnostics may have to be used.

Figure 1 shows the 3D SFR-Mass-Number plot, consisting of the SFR- M *  relation where the third dimension gives the number of galaxies in fixed-size (0.2×  0.2 dex) SFR- M *  bins. The two peaks correspond to actively SF galaxies, on the West side, and quenched galaxies, on the East side of the plot. Notice how sharp is the divide of the SF peak. Besides error effects, the saddle between the two peaks must include a mixture of galaxies, with some being in a temporary excursion to a low SFR coming from the SF peak, others are in a temporary excursion from the quenched peak, triggered by a minor gas-rich accretion event, whereas others are truly quenching galaxies on their final journey from the SF peak to the quenched galaxies depository. The number of quenched galaxies increases continuously from high to low redshifts, so across the valley the flow from the SF to the quenched peak must dominate.

In the 3D plot of Figure 2 the third dimension gives the product of the number of galaxies times their SFR, thus illustrating with extreme clarity where in the SFR- M *  plane star formation is concentrated. Similarly, in Figure 3 the third dimension now gives the product of the number of galaxies times their mass, hence illustrating where the stellar mass resides.

In Figure 2 the quenched galaxies virtually disappear, as most of the star formation concentrates on the main peak. The modest bump noticeable South-East of the main SF peak is due to a low level of star formation still present in a fraction of quenched galaxies, although just upper limits to SFR might have been measured for many of them. For this reason, the shape of the quenched peak (especially on its low SFR side) should not be overinterpreted. A comparison of the two figures shows that the main peak has shifted from the star-forming to the quenched one, as indeed most stars in the local Universe are contained in quenched galaxies and bulges [\citep=Baldry04].

A comparison of these three figures reveals that there is a fair number of galaxies in the valley between the two peaks (Figure 1) that indeed contribute to mass (Figure 3) but not much to SFR (Figure 2).

An Objective Main Sequence Definition

As the importance of the MS stems from its dominant contribution to the global star formation, it is worth rooting more deeply in this qualifying property its very definition. The sharpness of the SF peak in Figure 1 and Figure 2 offers indeed a quite natural definition of the MS as the ridge line of the SF peak, either in the 3D number or in the 3D number×  SFR plots, as the two divides nearly overlap each other. These 3D figures offer unquestionable evidence for the existence of the MS as well as of its more natural, cogent definition. This ridge line coincides with the mode of the SFR distribution at fixed M * . The median or the average SFR (at fixed M * ) might be measured more accurately, but would depend on a pre-selection of star-forming galaxies. The ridge line, instead, does not require such pre-selection. Stacking e.g., infrared or radio data has been widely used to trace the MS (e.g., [\citealt=Pannella09] [\citealt=Karim11] [\citealt=Rodighiero14]) but it requires pre-selecting SF galaxies, hence the result depends on the selection criterion.

Figure 4 shows the projection of the the 3D surface in Figure 1 over the SFR- M *  plane, along with contours for the number density of galaxies. Several notable features are emerging from this plot. The best straight-line fit to the ridge line is log(SFR) = [formula], with a slightly flatter slope than derived in P10 for u - g color selected blue galaxies in the same catalog, which was 0.9  ±  0.01. This difference arises from the combination of two effects: the use of SDSS DR7 instead of the DR4 release; in addition, the u - g color cut included several galaxies with [formula] and with SFR definitely below the ridge line, that we may interpret as quenching galaxies.

Figure 4 shows that the ridge line is straight linear up to the highest stellar masses in the sample, without a hint of flattening with increasing mass (see also [\citealt=Brinchmann04]. A bending of the main sequence could be due to the growing fraction of the total mass being given by bulges already quenched, hence contributing mass but no star formation (e.g., [\citealt=Whitaker12]). We don't see this effect in Figure 4 (up to [formula]), even though bulges should be maximally developed at z  ~  0. Rather, the increasing bulge fraction with galaxy mass may be responsible for the global deviation from ~  1 of the slope of the SFR- M *  relation [\citep=Abramson14].

For galaxies away from the MS peak Figure 4 shows that quenched galaxies populate two distinct peaks, one at high mass and one a low mass, which result from the double-Schechter shape of their mass function ([\citealt=Baldry04]; P10). The high-mass peak is well separated from the MS, with very few galaxies with intermediate SFRs. The low-mass peak is instead connected in a continuous fashion to the MS, with many transition objects in between. This has a similar counterpart in the color-mass plot, where at low masses the distinction between blue and red galaxies gets blurred [\citep=Taylor15]. In the frame of the P10 distinction between mass-quenched and environment quenched galaxies, the high-mass peak can be attributed to mass-quenching and the low-mass one to environment quenching.

The sharp dichotomy between the high mass, quenched galaxies and those populating the MS arises from two effects. The first, probably not the dominant one at this low redshift, is that the mass quenching process may be very fast, ensuring a rapid transition from the MS to the quenched galaxy repository. The second reason, that we believe is dominant at low redshifts, is that most massive galaxies were quenched a long time ago, so one expects very few to be in a transition phase now. Indeed, the stellar population properties of local massive early type galaxies (including ellipticals) indicate that in most cases quenching took place some 10 Gyr ago (see e.g., [\citealt=Renzini06], for a review). This interpretation is confirmed by the fact that virtually all massive ETGs are already in place at z  ~  1 [\citep=cimatti06], and therefore we do not expect much mass quenching of massive galaxies to take place now.

The situation is just the opposite at low-masses. The environment quenching rate increases with decreasing redshift, following the growth of large scale structure overdensities, and therefore is maximum at redshift zero. Indeed, it is well know that the number density of quenched galaxies increases by a factor of ~  2 since z  ~  1 (e.g., [\citealt=Bell04]), which is largely due to the increase in the number of low-mass quenched galaxies, whereas the number of massive quenched galaxies is stable in this redshift range.

To illustrate our proposal, this paper is limited to use data relative to the local Universe, but it is of great interests to follow the evolution of these 3D surfaces as a function of redshift, looking at how the twin peaks and the galaxy population of the ("green") valley between them are changing with time. Such surfaces can be used to trace the MS divide at the various redshifts, which should be feasible even if current galaxy samples at high redshifts are not as populous as those used here. This extension to higher redshifts is left to future works, but here we can venture in making explicit a few expectations. At redshift ~  2 one expects to find a very different pattern for quenched galaxies compared to what shown in Figure 4: mass quenching must have started at full steam (massive galaxies are growing very rapidly and very rapidly must be quenched). Instead, environment quenching has barely started, as overdensity contrasts are still small. One therefore expects the high-mass peak of quenched galaxies to be already in place and growing rapidly, whereas the low mass peak should be barely noticeable. The flow of galaxies across the green valley should be high at high masses, low at low masses.

These considerations may help understanding why in UVJ-selected samples of SF galaxies [\cite=Whitaker12] find a flattening of the SFR- M *  relation in high-mass galaxies at high redshifts, whereas [\cite=Whitaker14] find a steepening of the relation for low-mass galaxies at low redshift. In the former case the flattening may be due to the inclusion of massive galaxies already in their mass-quenching phase, whereas the steepening at low redshifts is likely due to the inclusion of low-mass galaxies in their environment-quenching phase (such as those seen in Figure 4).

Finally, Figure 5 shows a section of the twin peaks at log(M * ) = 10.5, for both the number and the number×  SFR distributions. The shape of the distribution of the quenched peak is affected by the large number of galaxies for which just SFR upper limits. More interesting is instead the distribution of the star-forming peak. The σ of its best fit Gaussian is 0.3 dex, which comes from a combination of intrinsics spread and measurement errors [\citep=Salmi12]. We can notice two deviations from gaussianity in the wings of the distribution. On the low SFR side the excess w.r.t. the best fit Gaussian is due to quenching galaxies, whereas at the opposite extreme the excess is likely due to starburst outliers from the MS. Notice also that there is a ~  0.2 dex shift in the peak of the pure number distribution and the number×  SFR distribution, a shift that is independent of mass: the ridge lines of the two surfaces run parallel to each other with a 0.2 dex difference and one can choose one or the other as the MS divide.

Conclusions

We have proposed to objectively define the Main Sequence of star-forming galaxies as the ridge line in the 3D surface defined by the SFR-mass-number relation, or nearly equivalently in the surface in which the third dimension is the product number×  SFR. These surfaces can be constructed with very great statistical significance for the local sample of SDSS galaxies, and provide a vivid, cogent view of the reality of the MS as a major property of galaxy populations. Such definition can be applied to samples galaxies at high redshifts as well, though with somewhat lesser statistical significance while different SFR indicators may have to be used in different redshift ranges. However, with the advent of near-IR multiobject spectrographs SFRs from Hα can be derived up to z  ~  2.5, i.e., using the same indicator as used here for local galaxies (e.g., [\citealt=Kashino13] [\citealt=Steidel14] [\citealt=Wisnioski14]).

We emphasize that according to the new definition the MS of local, low- z galaxies is indeed a straight line, with no sign of steepening at low masses or of flattening at high masses, features that may emerge when pre-selecting star-forming galaxies before constructing the MS. The logarithmic slope of the SFR- M *  relation is found to be 0.76 with the new definition of the MS, whereas it is 0.9 when using a u - g color pre-selection as in P10, though part of the difference comes from using SDSS DR7 as opposed to DR4 data.

A projection of the SFR- M *  - Number relation over the SFR- M *  plane reveals the existence of a number of low-mass galaxies with sub-MS SFRs, that we interpret as being undergoing environmental-quenching of their star formation, as expected in the phenomenological model of P10. At the opposite mass end, very few galaxies are now found in the course of their mass-quenching, as indeed the model predicts that most of mass-quenching should have taken place at higher redshifts.

In summary, we propose a definition for the MS which does not require a pre-selection of SF galaxies, which should facilitate the inter-comparison of results from different groups, help understanding MS galaxies as systems in a quasi-steady state equilibrium and especially provide a more objective criterion for identifying quenching galaxies.
