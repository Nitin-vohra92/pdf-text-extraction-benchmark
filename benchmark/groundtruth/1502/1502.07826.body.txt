Thermal equilibrium of non-neutral plasma in dipole magnetic field

Introduction

Self-organization of a long-lived structure (inhomogeneity of physical quantities) is often observed in macroscopic systems governed by long-range interactions such as gravity (creating astronomical systems like galaxies [\cite=Lynden-Bell]), electromagnetic force (creating plasma systems like magnetospheres [\cite=Schulz] [\cite=Boxer] [\cite=yoshida2013] or particle traps [\cite=Penning]), or magnetic interaction (Hamiltonian mean-field systems modeling magnetism [\cite=Antoniazzi] [\cite=Pakter]). The common physics is described by the Vlasov equation coupled with a relevant field equation. The long-lived structure is a particular stationary solution that is "robust" against microscopic perturbations. Here, we put the problem into the perspective of non-canonical Hamiltonian mechanics [\cite=Morrison], and show that the self-organization occurs on a leaf of topologically constrained phase space; the topological constraint originates from the adiabatic invariants, which defines a macroscopic hierarchy [\cite=YoshidaMahajan2014]. As a specific system, we consider a non-neutral (single species) plasma in a dipole magnetic field. Let us begin by explaining how this problem is interesting from both basic and applied physics viewpoints.

When a non-neutral plasma is put in a homogeneous longitudinal magnetic field, it is spontaneously confined, relaxing into a "thermal equilibrium" on a rigidly rotating frame [\cite=Penning] [\cite=Mal1] [\cite=Mal2]. Canceling the self electric field by the Lorentz-transformed electric filed, the Boltzmann distribution yields a homogeneous density profile inside the confinement region. The constant density profile and the constant angular momentum profile are the simultaneous characteristics of the relaxed state; there remains no free energy to excite macroscopic perturbations (as far as the system conserves the total angular momentum and is isolated from other energy sources like other species of particles or external electromagnetic fields). However, the consistency of the density distribution (dictated by the statistical mechanics of particles) and the electric potential (dictated by the field equation) relies heavily on the specialty of the homogeneous longitudinal magnetic field. Here, we investigate whether such a relaxed state exists in an inhomogeneous magnetic field. Experimentally it does exist in a dipole magnetic field [\cite=yoshida2010] [\cite=saitoh2010]; the charged particles self-organize a rigidly rotating clump. However, the density is no longer homogeneous. The aim of this study is to reveal the underlying principle that governs generalized relaxed states. Confinement of charged particles (especially antimatter particles) in a toroidal magnetic bottle has many advantages, for example, making possible to confine high-energy particles produced by isotopes or accelerators, or to confine different spices of positive and negative charges simultaneously [\cite=Yoshida1999] [\cite=Pedersen1] [\cite=Pedersen2].

Here we invoke the theory of phase-space foliation (or, topological constraint), and define a relaxed state as a thermal equilibrium on a leaf of phase space [\cite=YoshidaMahajan2014]. In the present argument, the adiabatic invariants of magnetized particles embody such foliated phase space. In an axisymmetric magnetic field, magnetized particles have three different adiabatic invariants, i.e., the magnetic moment μ, the action [formula] of bounce motion, and the action (canonical angular momentum) Pθ of the toroidal drift [\cite=adiabatic]; see Fig. [\ref=orbit]. We may approximate Pθ / q (q is the charge) by the magnetic flux function ψ such that [formula] (θ is the toroidal angle). When the magnetic field is sufficiently strong, the corresponding frequencies define a hierarchy: ωc (cyclotron frequency) ≫   ωb (bounce frequency) ≫   ωd (drift frequency). Hence, ψ is the most fragile constant --the homogenization with respect to ψ yields the relaxed state on the first (macroscopic) hierarchy of the adiabatic invariants. Needless to say, the ultimate relaxed state is achieved at the maximum homogeneity (maximum entropy) after destroying all adiabatic invariants, and it is the thermal death.

We define the "relaxed state" by a distribution function f that has no ψ dependence, i.e.,

[formula]

For the equilibrium to be non-trivial, we demand that the total canonical angular momentum [formula] to be a non-zero constant (d6z denotes the volume element of the phase space).

Kinetic model of macroscopic relaxed sate

In order to formulate the model with taking into account the hierarchy of adiabatic invariants, we write the Hamiltonian of a particle as

[formula]

We have omitted the kinetic energy (Pθ - qψ)2 / (2mr2) of the toroidal drift velocity by approximating Pθ = qψ [\cite=drift_kinetic]. By the symmetry, the toroidal angle θ is not included in Hgc. The gyro angle ϑc (which is conjugate to the magnetic moment μ) is coarse-grained by replacing [formula] with ωc, and is completely eliminated from Hgc (i.e., Hgc dictates the motion of the guiding center of the gyrating particle). However, the bounce angle (ϑb) is not ignored, because the frequencies ωc and ωb, as well as the electric potential φ are functions of the spacial coordinates including ϑb. Here we choose ψ and ζ (the parallel coordinate along each magnetic surface, the level-set of ψ) as the spatial coordinates (then, [formula]; [formula] is the bounce orbit length).

The action [formula] is conjugate to ϑb:

[formula]

For the periodic bounce motion, [formula]. Integrating ([\ref=bounce_action]) over the cycle of bounce motion yields the bounce-average [formula] constant. When we calculate macroscopic quantities (like the total energy or the total action), we evaluate [formula] as the adiabatic invariant [formula].

The drift frequency (including all grad-B, curvature, and E×  B drifts) is given by bounce-averaging the toroidal angular velocity

[formula]

In a homogeneous magnetic field, both ωc and ωb are constant, and then ([\ref=drift_frequency]) evaluates the E×  B drift frequency.

In terms of the constants of motion Hgc, μ, [formula], and ψ, a general equilibrium solution of the drift kinetic equation (such that {Hgc,f} = 0) is written as [formula]. The relaxed state is the special solution that maximizes the entropy [formula] under the constraints on

the total particle number [formula],

the total energy [formula],

the total magnetic moment [formula],

the total bounce action [formula],

the total angular momentum [formula].

The variational principle yields

[formula]

where Z (normalization factor), β (inverse temperature), γ1, γ2, and γ3 are constants related to the Lagrange multipliers on N, E, Cμ, [formula], and Cψ.

While we derived ([\ref=solution-1]) for a given set of constants, we may, alternatively, regard fT as a Boltzmann distribution on a grand-canonical ensemble parametrized by the aforementioned macroscopic quantities, and then, we interpret γ1,γ2 and γ3 as the chemical potentials pertinent to the changes in the action variables μ, [formula], and ψ, respectively (remember the parallel relations between the "energy level" and the frequency, as well as between the "particle number" and the action variable, in analogy with the Landau levels in quantum theory).

Finally, the determining equation ([\ref=relaxed-state_definition]) must be satisfied, which is equivalent to

[formula]

Remembering ([\ref=drift_frequency]), we find that ([\ref=ASEquilibrium]) implies rigid rotation.

The relaxed-state plasma occupies a finite domain that is surrounded by a magnetic surface, i.e., we can connect the distribution function fT to the vacuum f = 0 at some level-set ψ  =  ψ*. Invoking Heaviside's step function Y(ψ*  -  ψ) (which is zero inside the plasma region), we may write the extended distribution function as

[formula]

which is in equilibrium ({Hgc,T} = 0) and relaxed: ∂T  /  ∂ψ = 0 except at the boundary (the boundary is not "relaxed" as it reflects the constraint given by Cψ; later, we will show how the boundary is determined).

Neglecting the current generated by the plasma, ψ is a given function. Then, ([\ref=ASEquilibrium]) may be viewed as a determining equation for the electric potential φ (in addition to the term qφ, [formula] depends on φ in a complex way; however, if the electric field is much stronger than the thermal energy, we may approximate [formula], and then, [formula] is independent to φ, and we may put φ  =  φ(ψ)).

The electric potential φ included in Hgc must be consistent to the field equation The existence of a self-consistent field φ satisfying both ([\ref=ASEquilibrium]) and ([\ref=Poisson_eq]) is not at all obvious. In what follows, we will construct non-trivial solutions; one is the well-known "thermal equilibrium" in a straight homogeneous magnetic field, and the other is a new solution (numerical) in a dipole magnetic field.

Thermal equilibrium in a homogeneous magnetic field

First, we put the classical solution into the new perspective formulated here. In a homogeneous longitudinal magnetic field [formula] (B0 is a constant), ωc and ωb are constants. We may put ψ = B0r2 / 2 and φ  =  φ(ψ) (assuming that the relaxed state is homogeneous with respect to ζ = z). The relaxed-state condition ([\ref=relaxed-state_definition]) reads q∂φ  /  ∂ψ  =  γ3, which yields φ = (γ3 / q)ψ, and

[formula]

Since this distribution function has no spatial dependence, ρ  =  ρ0 (constant). On the field equation ([\ref=Poisson_eq]), the potential φ  =  (γ3 / q)ψ  =  (γ3 / q)B0r2 / 2 is consistent to the flat density ρ0, if γ3  =   - 2πq2ρ0 / B0 =  - ω2p / (2cωc). The parameter γ3 controls the density ρ0 (while γ1 and γ2 change the velocity anisotropy). Given the particle number N (per unit length in z), ρ0 = N / (πR2), where R is the radius of the plasma column. The total angular momentum evaluates Cψ  =  B0NR2 / 4. Hence, for given N and Cψ, we obtain [formula].

Relaxed state in a dipole magnetic field

In a dipole magnetic field, both ωc and ωb vary as functions of the spacial coordinates ψ and ζ. Because of the inhomogeneous Jacobian weight in the integral ([\ref=density]), the parameters γ1 and γ2, included in fT, cause a change in the profile of ρ [\cite=hasegawa2005] [\cite=yoshida2013], which is in marked contrast to the foregoing case of homogeneous magnetic field.

Assuming some φ in fT, we calculate ρ by ([\ref=density]), and then solve ([\ref=Poisson_eq]) for a new φ. Iterating this process, we obtain a self-consistent φ and a kinetic equilibrium fT. Next we have to vary the parameters γ1, γ2, and γ3 to find the relaxed state.

Since the left-hand side of ([\ref=ASEquilibrium]) contains μ and [formula], we cannot satisfy ([\ref=ASEquilibrium]) for each particle having different μ and [formula] (excepting the case when ∂ωc  /  ∂ψ  =  ∂ωb  /  ∂ψ = 0, as it is in a homogeneous magnetic field). Instead, we demand that the macroscopic drift velocity

[formula]

is rigid rotation (vθ is directly evaluated by the orbit calculations). The chemical potentials γ1,γ2, and γ3 are the control parameters to be optimized to yield rigid rotation.

Figure [\ref=solution] shows an example of solution. Here we assume parameters that simulate the RT-1 experiment [\cite=yoshida2010]. The temperature β- 1 = 50eV is chosen to be the typical energy of the injected electrons. Other parameters are [formula], by which βγ1μ, [formula], βγ3ψ, and βqφ are all of order βH  ~  1 (implying that all terms in fT play essential roles in characterizing the relaxed state).

Numerical analysis

Here we study how general equilibrium solutions (consistent φ and fT satisfying {Hgc,fT} = 0 and the Poisson equation ([\ref=Poisson_eq]) simultaneously) vary as the parameters are changed, and how these parameters can be optimized to send the equilibrium to the relaxed state.

For the convenience, we introduce indexes to evaluate the "relaxation": i.e., d the spatially averaged toroidal drift frequency, σωd the associated standard deviation, and χ a measure of rigidity of the rotation.

In Fig. [\ref=dependences], the behavior of χ as a function of the control parameters γ1, γ2, γ3, and φ0 (the electric potential at the coil surface) is shown. A detailed explanation for each parameter is given in the following subsections.

Chemical potential γ1 of the magnetic moment μ

The dependence of the equilibrium state on the parameter γ1 (the chemical potential of the magnetic moment μ) is shown in Figs. [\ref=omegadg1] (plots of ωd) and [\ref=rhog1] (plots of ρ). Here, other parameters are fixed at φ0 =  - 250  V, β- 1 = 50eV, and [formula]. As γ1 is increased, the density approaches to the distribution [formula] [\cite=yoshida2013]. However, the rigidity of the rotation is a weak function of γ1 (see Fig. [\ref=dependences]).

Chemical potential γ2 of the bounce action [formula]

The chemical potential γ2 of the bounce action [formula] has a rather strong influence on the equilibrium distribution; see Figs. [\ref=omegadg2] (plots of ωd) and [\ref=rhog2] (plots of ρ). With the optimum value [formula], the density ρ has a broad distribution with a highly homogeneous drift frequency ωd. However, when γ2 is increased, the density profile shrinks to a disk-like shape with a strong shear in ωd. Here, other parameters are fixed at φ0 =  - 250  V, β- 1 = 50eV, and [formula]. The change of χ as a function of γ2 is given in Fig. [\ref=dependences].

Chemical potential γ3 of the angular momentum ψ

The chemical potential γ3 of the angular momentum ψ also has a strong influence on the equilibrium; see Figs. [\ref=omegadg3] (plots of ωd) and [\ref=rhog3] (plots of ρ). As γ3 is increased, the distribution function becomes f  ≈  eβ(γ3ψ - qφ), and then the drift frequency scales as ωd  ~  r- 1, since ωd = q∂φ  /  ∂ψ and, at z = 0, ψ  ~  r- 1 and φ  ~  r- 2 (if we assume a constant particle number per flux tube volume [\cite=hasegawa2005], ρ  ~  r- 4 which gives Δφ  ~  r- 4). Here, other parameters are fixed at φ0 =  - 250  V, β- 1 = 50eV, and [formula]. The change of χ as a function of γ3 can be found in Fig. [\ref=dependences].

Inner boundary potential φ0

In addition to the four parameters β, γ1, γ2, and γ3, there is another important parameter φ0 that is the boundary value of the potential φ at the surface of the internal magnet. By changing φ0, the confinement is dramatically improved; see the experimental result reported in [\cite=Saitoh2004]. On the levitated magnet experiment [\cite=yoshida2010], however, φ0 is spontaneously determined, because the coil surface is floating. Figures [\ref=omegadphicoil] and [\ref=rhophicoil], respectively, show the distribution of the drift frequency ωd and the density ρ for four different values of φ0. Other parameters are fixed at β- 1 = 50eV and [formula]. Interestingly, as φ0 changes, the confinement region (the density clump) moves, while the rigidity of the rotation is not influenced by φ0; see Fig. [\ref=dependences].

Conclusion

Putting a classical knowledge into a wider perspective, a deeper principle may emerge; here we have described such an example of paradigm shift in the study of the relaxed state (or, thermal equilibrium) of charged particles. Formulating a relaxed state on a topologically constrained macroscopic phase space, we have found that a rigidly-rotating equilibrium can self-organize even in an inhomogeneous magnetic field. In an experimental system, tuning of the parameters γ1,γ2,γ3, and φ0 occurs spontaneously through the relaxation process. Among them, γ2 and γ3 influence strongly on the profile of ωd. Whereas we formulated the equilibrium assuming that the corresponding [formula] and Cψ are given (then, the Lagrange multipliers γ2 and γ3 are determined by prescribed [formula] and Cψ), the plasma may change them (by dissipating the constants of motion) in order to relax into the thermal equilibrium; the self-organization is a process that selects optimum [formula] and Cψ (hence, γ2 and γ3). In fact, these two actions are relatively "fragile" with respect to the other constant Cμ.

The present model of relaxed states differs from the previously formulated Boltzmann distribution of a neutral plasma [\cite=yoshida2013], which is created by constraining only Cμ and [formula] (in addition to the standard constraints N and E) in maximizing the entropy; freeing Cψ means that ψ is not a conserved quantity. In the present formulation, however, we also constrain Cψ, while we demand ∂f / ∂ψ = 0 as the criteria of the relaxed state. The latter is a weaker criterion, i.e., the present solution is not necessarily the maximum entropy state of the former setting, as far as ψ is freed from the kinetic energy (i.e., we omit the energy of the drift velocity) and is deemed as a spatial coordinate variable. This is obvious by putting γ3 (the Lagrange multiplier on Cψ) = 0 in the thermal equilibrium ([\ref=Penning-2]). Then, the solution becomes [formula], [formula] with βqφ  →   constant (=    ∞  ), i.e., the radius of the plasma column diverges, implying no confinement.. The constraint on the total angular momentum Cψ yields a finite radius of confinement.
