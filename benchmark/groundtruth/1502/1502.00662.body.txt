Candidate quantum spin liquid in the Ce pyrochlore stannate Ce2Sn2O7

Quantum-mechanical phase coherence is a major theme of modern physics. Various states with macroscopic quantum coherence such as superconductors [\cite=Josephson69], superfluids  [\cite=Mayers2004], fractional quantum Hall states  [\cite=Kellogg2004] and optically confined Bose-Einstein condensates  [\cite=Andrews1997] have been identified, all with remarkable macroscopic properties. In insulators containing localized spin degrees of freedom, spin liquids can emerge [\cite=Balents:2010jx] [\cite=Normand:2009wk], which have no conventional order parameter associated with a broken space group symmetry, but whose defining character is a long-range entangled groundstate wavefunction [\cite=Isakov:2011fz] [\cite=Wen:2002cy]. Spin liquids are of great interest thanks to the remarkable collective phenomena that they can present, such as emergent gauge fields and fractional quasiparticle excitations [\cite=Gingras:2014ip] [\cite=Moessner:2010ev]. Such states may also offer the possible application of coherent or topologically protected ground states in quantum information processing devices [\cite=Yao:2013ea].

Quantum coherence of a spin system lacking symmetry-breaking order is well established in one-dimensional spin chains forming a spin fluid with a quantum coherence length almost an order of magnitude larger than the classical antiferromagnetic correlation length  [\cite=Xu2007]. In higher dimensions two paradigms are employed, often simultaneously, to try to obtain a quantum spin liquid (QSL). Firstly, for Heisenberg spins with S=1/2, where quantum mechanical corrections are most significant compared to classical states, quantum melting of the Néel ground state may be possible when spins pair into valence bond singlets [\cite=Lhuillier:BEVn7Mgc]. The result may be a valence bond crystal (translationally ordered valence bonds)  [\cite=Korepin2010], a resonating valence bond state (singlet configurations resonate around a plaquette)  [\cite=Anderson], or a true spin liquid when valence bonds can be formed at all lengthscales so that the ground state wavefunction has a genuine long-range entanglement  [\cite=Liang1988] [\cite=Balents:2010jx]. Secondly, geometrically frustrated magnets are a natural landscape for liquid-like states of magnetic moments. In two dimensions, the triangular and kagome lattices are important examples  [\cite=Lee2007] [\cite=Yamashita2010] [\cite=Pratt2011] [\cite=Isono2014], and neutron scattering experiments on the S=1/2 kagome lattice antiferromagnet ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 (herbertsmithite) have provided evidence of fractionalized excitations in a 2D QSL  [\cite=Han2012] [\cite=DeVries:2009gh]. In three dimensions QSLs are expected on the hyperkagome (e.g. in Na4Ir3O8  [\cite=Canals:1998ur] [\cite=Okamoto2007]) and pyrochlore lattices. Despite the preponderance of S=1/2 spin liquid candidates mentioned above, recent work on pyrochlore spin liquid candidates such as Yb2Ti2O7  [\cite=Ross:2011tv] [\cite=Chang:2012el], Pr2Zr2O7  [\cite=Kimura:2013gj] and Pr2Sn2O7  [\cite=Zhou:2008cz] have illustrated how quantum effects can become important in materials where they may not be expected, i.e. in rare earth materials where important crystal field effects lead to highly anisotropic spins.

The spin system of a pyrochlore with a thermally isolated doublet ground state can be described by a generalized Hamiltonian for effective S = 1 / 2 spins [\cite=Curnoe:2008gy] [\cite=Ross:2011tv]. This Hamiltonian includes all symmetry-allowed near neighbour exchanges, with a leading interaction which establishes a classical ground state if acting alone, and competing transverse exchange terms that introduce quantum fluctuations. It is worth noting that for Kramers ions, there is no requirement for these competing exchange terms to be small with respect to the leading term  [\cite=Gingras:2014ip]. A leading ferromagnetic interaction leads to a classical spin liquid ground state, the spin-ice state. Exotic quantum phases are obtained as a function of the transverse terms  [\cite=Hermele:2004gg] [\cite=Onoda:2010jf] [\cite=Benton:2012ep] [\cite=Savary:2012cq] [\cite=Gingras:2014ip]: the quantum spin ice or U(1) spin liquid, a disordered phase whose emergent properties are those of a U(1)-gauge theory [\cite=Hermele:2004gg] [\cite=Benton:2012ep] [\cite=Gingras:2014ip], and the Coulombic ferromagnet, an ordered phase with deconfined spinons, whose existence is under debate [\cite=Gingras:2014qsi].

In rare earth pyrochlores with antiferromagnetic interactions, where the Ising magnetic moment points "in" or "out" of the tetrahedron (i.e. along the local [formula] axis), the classical ground state is the "all-in/all-out" FeF3 structure [\cite=Bramwell:1998wka] [\cite=FeFe3]. The introduction of strong quantum effects may melt the classical order to produce a type of spin liquid, rather as in other unfrustrated quantum antiferromagnets. In this Letter we report on Ce2Sn2O7, a pyrochlore magnet based on Ce3 + (4f1, 2F5 / 2). The local moments have [formula] Ising anisotropy, and we find that although antiferromagnetic spin correlations develop below approximately 1 K, there is no sign of magnetic order down to 0.02 K. The magnetic moment is small, suggesting that the dipolar couplings are much smaller than exchange interactions. This makes Ce2Sn2O7 an excellent model material to look for novel exchange-induced QSLs on the pyrochlore lattice.

The low-temperature magnetic properties of Ce3 + pyrochlores have been little studied, probably because of the difficulty to stabilize the magnetic Ce3 + oxidation state in preference to the non-magnetic Ce4 + (4f0). In Ce2Sn2O7, a compound previously investigated for its oxygen storage capabilities [\cite=TOLLA:1999tq], the trivalent rare-earth can be readily stabilized by taking advantage of a solid state oxydo-reductive reaction during which Sn0 is oxidized to Sn4 + while reducing Ce4 + to the required Ce3 +. Polycrystalline samples of Ce2Sn2O7 were characterized by laboratory X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis, all results being in agreement with previous reports [\cite=TOLLA:1999tq]. The Rietveld refinement of a neutron powder diffraction pattern (HRPT) recorded at 1.5 K is shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig.1] and gives the lattice parameter 10.6453(3) Å  (space group: Fdm). The value of the atomic coordinate [formula] for the oxygen atom O(48[formula]) is 0.3315(3), in the range of the typical values for A2B2O7 compounds [\cite=Gardner:2010fu]. The Ce-O(48f) bond length is [formula] Å, close to the sum of the ionic radii (2.68 Å), while Ce-O'(8b) bond (pointing along the local [formula] direction) has a length of [formula] Å, which is markedly shorter than 2.68 Å, as usually observed in rare-earth pyrochlores. Attempts to refine antisite cation disorder ([formula]) and oxygen Frenkel disorder ([formula]), which can induce stuffing effects and disordered exchange interactions, respectively, did not provide evidence for structural defects.

Magnetization (M) data were measured in the temperature (T) range from 1.8 to 375 K in an applied magnetic field (H) of 0.01 T using a Quantum Design MPMS-XL SQUID magnetometer. Additional magnetization, and ac-susceptibility, measurements were made as a function of temperature and field, from T = 0.07 to 4.2 K and from μ0H = 0 to 8 T, using SQUID magnetometers equipped with a miniature dilution refrigerator developed at the Institut Néel-CNRS Grenoble. The heat capacity (Cp) of a pelletized sample was measured down to 0.3 K using a Quantum Design PPMS. Muon spin relaxation (μSR) measurements were performed at the LTF spectrometer of the Swiss Muon Source, in the range from T = 0.02 to 0.8 K. Muons were longitudinally polarized and spectra were recorded in zero-field with earth-field compensation or in applied magnetic fields parallel to the beam.

The magnetization divided by the applied field M / H, which is equal to susceptibility χ in the linear field regime, is shown as a function of the temperature T over the full temperature range in Fig. [\ref=Fig.2]A. The susceptibility increases continuously with decreasing temperature, and there is no evidence of any ordering transition. At high temperature, T > 130 K, the inverse susceptibility χ- 1 (shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig.2]B) is almost linear, and a fit to the Curie-Weiss law yields a magnetic moment [formula] [formula], in reasonable agreement with the expected free ion value of 2.54 [formula], and [formula] K. This is an extremely large value for such a rare-earth material, where magnetic interactions are expected to be in the Kelvin range. The large value of θCW can be attributed to crystal field effects, as shown by the strong curvature of χ- 1(T) below 100 K, indicating a change in the population of crystal field levels of the Ce3 + ion. Below 10 K and down to 1 K, a linear behavior is observed, and the Curie-Weiss fit to this low temperature part of χ- 1(T) gives a magnetic moment of [formula] [formula], which corresponds to the moment of the ground state doublet, and [formula] K. Fig. [\ref=Fig.2]C shows that the effective moment ([formula]) approaches the free ion value at 375 K, and it falls to an approximate plateau of [formula] in the temperature range from T = 1 to 10 K.

The magnetic susceptibility was used to estimate the crystal field scheme. In the LS coupling scheme, a crystal electric field with the D3d symmetry of the Ce3 + site splits the 2F5 / 2 free ion ground state into three Kramers doublets. However, the ground state multiplet 2F5 / 2 alone does not allow to reproduce our experimental data. Instead, we used matrix elements of the crystal field Hamiltonian which are calculated by applying operators on the full basis of f-electron microstates (14 microstates in the case of Ce3 +) [\cite=Condon:1970]. This was accomplished using the computer program Condon which takes into account the effect of the applied magnetic field and allows fitting the Wybourne coefficients of the ligand-field Hamiltonian on χ(T) data [\cite=Schilder:2004vb]. The refinement of six ligand-field parameters for the case of a 4f1 ion in D3d local symmetry to the susceptibility was realized between T = 1.8 and 375 K, and the resulting calculation of the single ion magnetic moment is shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig.2]C. The wavefunctions of the ground state Kramers doublet correspond to a linear combination of [formula] and [formula] states. The fitted coefficients result in energy levels at [formula] meV and [formula] meV, and four more levels distributed around 300 meV, which are all Kramers doublets. Although all levels consist of mixed ground (2F5 / 2) and first excited (2F7 / 2) multiplets, the lower levels are dominated by the 2F5 / 2 term, while the upper four levels are dominated by the 2F7 / 2 term. The local anisotropy axis of the crystal field levels yields a strong Ising anisotropy along the [formula] axis. The intermultiplet splitting of [formula] meV is typical value for the transition between the ground and first excited multiplet in Ce3 + compounds  [\cite=liu]. This crystal field scheme of Ce2Sn2O7 is generallly consistent with the calculations using the multiX computer program [\cite=Uldry:2012td] if the semi-empirical values for the spin-orbit coupling and crystal field scalers are adjusted accordingly.

In Fig. [\ref=Fig.3]A we show isothermal magnetization curves, M vs. H, evidencing another striking feature. At moderate and low temperatures, i.e. in the plateau region of the effective moment and below, M saturates at roughly half of the value of the effective magnetic moment observed in the moderate temperature plateau. This is reminiscent of the spin-ices Ho2Ti2O7 and Dy2Ti2O7 where, due to the important non-collinear local anisotropy, the low-temperature magnetization curves display a similar behavior  [\cite=Bramwell:2000tc]. Using a simple expression to model the magnetization of non-interacting Ising spins with local [formula] easy-axis anisotropy and [formula] spins  [\cite=Bramwell:2000tc] our M vs. H data are satisfactorily reproduced for temperatures down to 1 K with a parameterized g-factor of 2.18. The saturation of the magnetization at this value up to applied fields as large as 8 T indicates a strong local anisotropy, as expected from the large energy gap to the first excited doublet.

We now examine the interactions amongst the Ce3 + moments. The constant extracted from the Curie-Weiss fit at low temperature ([formula] K) suggests antiferromagnetic interactions, but no ordering is observed in the magnetization data down to 0.07 K, as shown in the inset of Fig. [\ref=Fig.2]A. Evidence for antiferromagnetic correlations is provided by the value of the effective moment, which, below 1 K, falls below that of the ground state doublet, as shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig.2]C. Simultaneously, below this temperature, the isothermal M vs. H curves shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig.3]A depart from the single-ion form which reproduces well the curves at higher temperatures, thus confirming the onset of interactions and correlations. Moreover, the same magnetization curves are plotted as a function of H / T in Fig. [\ref=Fig.3]B. Above 1 K, in the paramagnetic regime, the curves collapse onto one another, as expected for non-interacting spins. Below 1 K, the curves increasingly deviate from this scaling, and their suppression for T < 1 K relative to those for T > 1 K supports the development of antiferromagnetic interactions.

Heat capacity data, Cp(T) (see inset of Fig. [\ref=Fig.2]C), show that the decrease of the effective magnetic moment at very low temperature is accompanied by a rise in the heat capacity. This corroborates our claim that the variations observed in the magnetization data at sub-Kelvin temperatures are associated with cooperative phenomena. Given the energy levels derived from the fits to the susceptibility, it is unlikely that a Schottky anomaly is at the origin of the low temperature upturn in the heat capacity (as was proposed for Ce2Zr2O7  [\cite=Popa:2008]), nor is any nuclear contribution expected for Ce2Sn2O7 since all isotopes of cerium have nuclear spin of zero.

The ac-susceptibility (not shown) follows the M(T) / H curve, has no frequency dependence down to 0.07 K in the range 1.11 - 211 Hz, and the out-of-phase signal remains unobservable in our experiments. The absence of any signature of magnetic freezing means, in the absence of long-range order, that the magnetic fluctuations are faster than the correlation times probed by the technique. μSR measurements were made in order to extend our study to lower temperatures and higher frequencies. Zero-field spectra were recorded at several temperatures between 0.02 K and 0.8 K in order to have sufficient overlap with the temperature range of our macroscopic measurements. The zero-field data can be fitted with a stretched exponential relaxation, giving [formula] MHz and a stretched exponent [formula] (Fig. [\ref=Fig.4]A). No temperature dependence of the extracted 1 / T1 and β values was observed in the temperature range from 0.02 to 0.8 K. The spin correlations are dynamic at low temperatures, because the relaxation function does not change in the presence of external longitudinal fields (see e.g. 2 T on Fig. [\ref=Fig.4]A). In Fig. [\ref=Fig.4]B we show that a paramagnetic frequency shift which tracks the magnetic susceptibility was observed in transverse magnetic fields, indicating that the muon does not significantly perturb the system.

Classical spins on the pyrochlore lattice with [formula] anisotropy together with competing Heisenberg exchange and dipolar interactions [\cite=denHertog:2000tc] lead to spin ices when the dipolar interaction ([formula]) dominates, while a strong antiferromagnetic exchange ([formula]) stabilizes "all-in/all-out" long-range order. In Ce2Sn2O7, using the low temperature effective moment, we can calculate [formula] K, while the energy scale of the antiferromagnetic interactions, [formula], obtained from the whole set of magnetization measurements is about 0.5 K. Therefore, the resulting nearest neighbour interaction [formula], so that the system should be deep in the antiferromagnetic regime and a phase transition is expected at a temperature where the correlations become strong, around 0.5 K. Ce2Sn2O7 does not conform to this prediction, suggesting that "quantum fluctuations" allow the system to evade the classicaly predicted magnetic order and to retain a correlated dynamical state down to a temperature at least one order of magnitude smaller than the temperature at which correlations are established. It is clear that the small value of the moment and its Kramers nature, which are present in Ce2Sn2O7, significantly enhance the quantum fluctuations on the pyrochlore lattice.

In summary, we suggest that Ce2Sn2O7 is a model system to study a strongly correlated short-range antiferromagnetic state on the pyrochlore lattice. The magnetism features several important characteristics of exchange-based spin liquids - 〈111〉 Ising spins coupled antiferromagnetically which become correlated but remain disordered to the lowest temperatures. Ce2Sn2O7 is structurally well ordered and based on an isolated Kramers doublet featuring a small moment. This strongly Ising character of the localized magnetic moment is particularly important since all other pyrochlore materials with antiferromagnetic interactions featuring Kramers doublets either have XY character (e.g Er2Ti2O7  [\cite=Champion:2003ErTi] [\cite=Zhitomirsky:2014:ErTi] [\cite=Savary:2012:ErTi]) and/or larger moments (e.g. Nd2Zr2O7 which appears to order below 300 mK  [\cite=blote]), while non-Kramers systems with magnetic doublets such as those based on Tb3 + are further complicated by low-lying crystal fields {[\cite=Gardner:2010fu]. Although classical calculations for the multi-axis Ising antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice predict a conventional magnetic order, our data suggest that quantum fluctuations play an important role in destabilizing this ordering. It would be most interesting if theory could further our understanding of the Ising antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice in the extreme quantum limit.
