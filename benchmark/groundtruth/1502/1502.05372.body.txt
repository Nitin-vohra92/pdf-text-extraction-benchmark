Zeta functions and subgroup growth in P2 / m

Introduction

The zeta function of a group G is defined as [formula], where an(G) denotes the number of subgroups of index n in G. Analogously, the normal zeta function of a group G is given by [formula], where cn(G) is the number of normal subgroups of index n in G. These functions provide a useful tool for studying the relationship between the asymptotic behavior of the sequences an(G), resp. cn(G), and the structure of G. The concepts of the zeta and normal zeta function were applied to nilpotent groups by Smith [\cite=S], and Grunewald, Segal and Smith [\cite=GSS]. Building upon our previous results related to the space groups with the point group isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2 (see [\cite=AA]), we derive explicit expressions for the zeta and normal zeta function of P2 / m in Sections 2. and 3., and determine the exact number of its subgroups and normal subgroups of finite index, in Section 4. In the final section, we turn our attention to the subgroup growth.

The group P2 / m is the tenth group in the International Tables for Crystallography [\cite=H]. It contains translations, reflections and diad rotations. The translations form a normal abelian subgroup T of rank 3 - the translation subgroup of P2 / m or the Bravais lattice. The point group of P2 / m, i.e., its quotient by the translation subgroup T, is a finite group isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order two (Klein 4-group).

A minimal set of generators of P2 / m and the algebraic relations the generators satisfy are as follows (cf.[\cite=L])

[formula]

The subgroups [formula], [formula], [formula] of the group P2 / m are isomorphic to space groups Pm, P2 and [formula], respectively, while the subgroup [formula] is isomorphic to P1, i.e., to [formula]. Therefore, the part of knowledge about the zeta and normal zeta functions of these groups, summarized in the next theorem, will be useful for our present purpose.

For a sake of bravity, we denote the translates of the Riemann zeta function by: ζk(s)  =  ζ(s  -  k), i.e., ζ2(s)  =  ζ(s  -  2).

Recall that [formula] converges absolutely for Re(s) > k + 1 and has a meromorphic extension to the whole complex plane with a simple pole at s = k + 1.

Zeta and normal zeta functions of groups [formula], P2 and Pm read as follows

[formula]

ζP2(s) = (1   +   2    -    s    +    3)ζ(s)ζ1(s)ζ2(s)

ζPm(s) = (1   +   9   ·   2    -    s   +   6   ·   2    -    2s)ζ(s)ζ(s)ζ1(s)   +   2    -    sζ(s)ζ1(s)ζ2(s)

Due to group isomorphisms mentioned above, the latter explicit expressions are the building blocks in forming the zeta and normal zeta function of P2 / m.

Zeta function of P2 / m

The zeta function of the space groups P2 / m is given by:

[formula]

Proof. The proof proceeds in five steps. First, we count only those subgroups of [formula] that are not contained in G21, G22, G23, G3. Then, we count those subgroups of G21 that are not contained in G22, G23, G3. The same procedure applies to G22 and G23. This way, we avoid over-counting of subgroups of a finite index.

Now, any subgroup of G1 has the form [formula], where a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k and l are integers. To avoid over - counting, we require that [formula] [\cite=M]. The index of this subgroup is gjl. Note that we cannot allow g, j or l to be 0 as this would give a subgroup of infinite index in G. The restrictions on those possible values are represented in the following tableau

[formula].

Reading down the columns, this tableau quickly sums up the information we have just derived about H1. If H1 is a subgroup of G, then according to the second isomorphism theorem, [formula] has to be normal subgroup in H1 and [formula]. For [formula] to be a normal subgroup in H1, we must have [formula] for [formula]. To verify this, it is sufficient to take the generators of H1 and [formula]. Let us take u  =  mxaybzc∈H1 and [formula]. Now, we have: [formula]. Hereof, [formula], if [formula].

Repeating the process for the remaining generators, we get another condition [formula].

Since [formula] is isomorphic to a subgroup of the Klein group, we see that (mxaybzc)2 ,(rxdyezf)2, [formula]. Using the relations between elements in the group, we conclude that the condition (mxaybzc)2 [formula] is equivalent to x2az2c [formula]. Indeed,

[formula].

The remaining conditions lead to another requirement y2e [formula].

So, we end up with the following conditions xgy   -   hzi, x2az2c, y   -   jzk, y2e [formula]. If xgy   -   hzi lies in [formula], then there exist integer numbers α1,β1,γ1 such that xgy   -   hzi = (xgyhzi)α1(yjzk)β1(zl)γ1. Thus, we get the following system of equations

[formula]

By taking into account the conditions [formula], this system can be reduced to

[formula]

To solve the system, we distinguish eight cases depending on the parity of each of the numbers g,j,l. We keep in mind that [formula]. So, if g,j,l are odd numbers, we see that a has to be 0. Hence α2  =  β2  =  0. Since l is odd, it follows that c  =  0. Similarly, we get k  =  0 and e  =  0. From α2  =  0, it follows that there exist l choices for i. There are no additional restrictions on b,d,f. Thus, the contribution to the zeta function of group P2 / m coming from this case is: [formula]. In other seven cases, we get the contributions: [formula], if g,j are odd and l is even; [formula], if g,l are odd and j is even; [formula], if l,j are odd and g is even; [formula], if g,j are even and l is odd; [formula], if g,l are even and j is odd; [formula], if l,j are even and g is odd; [formula], if i,j,g are even.

Adding the above contributions, we see that the total share in the zeta function of P2 / m coming from subgroups of the form H1 is: (1  +  20  ·  2   -   s  +  36  ·  2   -   2s)ζ2(s)ζ1(s)ζ1(s).

If H2 is a subgroup of G21, then [formula]. Taking only those subgroups of G21 that are not contained in G22, G23, G3 and making use of the respective part of Theorem 1.1, we derive the following share in the zeta function coming from subgroups of the form H2: 2  -  s(1  +  9  ·  2   -   s + 6  ·  2   -   2s)ζ21(s)ζ(s).

Now, let H3 be a subgroup of G22. Then [formula]. In view of Theorem 1.1., those subgroups of G22 that are not contained in G23 and G3, yield the share: 2   -   s  ·  (1  +  7  ·  2   -   s)ζ(s)ζ1(s)ζ2(s).

For a subgroup H4 of the group G23, we have [formula]. Now, the subgroups of G23 that are not contained in G3, combined with the information from Theorem 1.1., imply the share: 2   -   s  ·  ζ1(s)ζ2(s)ζ3(s).

Finally, we still have to consider the subgroups of the translation subgroup [formula]. If H5 is a subgroup of G3, then [formula]. Since the zeta function of [formula] is ζ(s)ζ1(s)ζ2(s), we get the share: 2 - 2sζ(s)ζ1(s)ζ2(s).

Combining all above contributions stemming from subgroups H1, H2, H3, H4 and H5, we get the zeta function of P2 / m as stated in the Theorem.

Normal zeta function of P2 / m

The normal zeta function of P2 / m is given by: [formula]

Proof. We apply a similar procedure as in the case of Theorem 2.1. Since normality is not a transitive relation, the first step is to add the conditions for normality of H1: (mxaybzc)m, (rxdyezf)m, (mxaybzc)r, (rxdyezf)r, (mxaybzc)x, (rxdyezf)x, (mxaybzc)y, (rxdyezf)y, (mxaybzc)z, (rxdyezf)z [formula].

We obtain that y2b,x2az2c,y2, x2dz2f,y2e, [formula]. The conditions [formula] already being involved in the process, we may omit them while forming the second system of equations:

[formula].

Solving the system that consists of equations given in C'1 and C2, we conclude that the contribution to the normal zeta function coming from H1 is:

[formula]

It is easily seen that a normal subgroup of G21 is also a normal subgroup of G = P2 / m. In this case, consideration of subgroups that are not contained in G22, G23, G3 and the facts from Theorem 1.1 yield the normal zeta function contribution: 2   -   s(1  +  11  ·  2   -   s  +  12  ·  2   -   2s)ζ(s)ζ1(s).

A normal subgroup of [formula] is also a normal subgroup of G  =  P2  /  m. Counting only those groups that are not contained in G23 and G3 and using Theorem 1.1., we get the contribution to the normal zeta function of group P2 / m: [formula].

The normal subgroup of [formula] of the form [formula], with 0  ≤  a  <  d,0  ≤  b,e  <  g,0  ≤  c,f,h  <  i, is a normal subgroup of G  =  P2  /  m. Again, Theorem 1.1 and the groups that are not contained in G3 yield the share [formula].

Denote a subgroup of [formula] by H5. It takes the form [formula], where we assume 0  <  a,0  ≤  b  <  d,0  ≤  c,e  <  f. Based on the conditions of normality, we deduce y2d,y2b∈H5 and another set of constraints:

[formula]

The equations 0  =  aα1,2b  =  bα1  +  dβ1 and the assumption that d is even imply that b can be 0 or [formula]. If we assume that d is odd, then b = 0 is the only choice for b. Similarly, the equations 0  =  aα2,2d  =  bα2  +  dβ2,0  =  cα2  +  eβ2  +  fγ2 and an assumption that f is odd yield that there is only one choice for e. However, if we assume that f is even, then there exist two options for e. If d and f are both even and b = 0, then there are two choices for e; if [formula], then e has to be 0.

We have the following contribution:

[formula]

Finally, we obtain the explicit expression for the normal zeta function of group P2  /  m:

[formula]

Subgroups of finite index in P2 / m

In the sequel, d(n) denotes the number of all positive divisors of a positive integer n and σ(n) is the sum of all positive divisors for a positive integer n, i. e. [formula] as usual. The answer we are looking for is contained in the next two propositions. Their validity readily follows from Theorem 2.1. and Theorem 3.1. and the fact that the product of two Dirichlet series [formula] and [formula], where f and g are two arithmetic functions, is a Dirichlet series [formula] with the coefficients [formula]. The last sum extends over all positive divisors l of n, or equivalently over all distinct pairs (a,b) of positive integers whose product is n. Let us remember that d(n) and σ(n) are coefficients of Dirichlet series ζ(s)ζ(s) and ζ(s)ζ1(s) respectively.

The number an of all subgroups of index n in the group P2 / m is given by the following expressions

if n is even,

[formula]

if n is odd,

[formula]

In particular, ap  =  p2  +  2p for every odd prime p.

The number cn of all normal subgroups of index n in group P2 / m reads:

c1  =  1

if n is odd and n  ≠  1,cn  =  0

if n is even,

[formula]

P2 / m is a group of degree 3.

Proof. Recall that the degree of a group G is defined by [formula], where an(G) is the number of subgroups of index n in G. In other words, deg(G) is the "smallest" positive real number c such an(G)  =  O(nc   +   ε), for all ε  >  0 and all n.

Proposition 4.1. implies [formula]. By Robin's inequality, we have σ(l)  =  O(l log  log l). Hence, [formula]. Thus, an  =  O(n3( log  log n)2)  =  O(n3   +   ε) for every ε  >  0 and every n.

On the other hand, let us have a look at the subsequence a2p, where p runs through the prime numbers. Obviously, [formula]. Now, Proposition 4.1. and straightforward calculations yield a2p  =  p3  +  30p2  +  60p  +  2. Then [formula]. Thus, deg (P2 / m)  =  3.
