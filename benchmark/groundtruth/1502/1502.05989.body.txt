Abstract

We present an inequality for tensor product of positive operators on Hilbert spaces by considering the tensor product of operators as words on certain alphabets (i.e., a set of letters). As applications of the operator inequality and by a multilinear approach, we show some matrix inequalities concerning induced operators and generalized matrix functions (including determinants and permanents as special cases).

Introduction

Let H be a Hilbert space over the complex number field [formula] with an inner product 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉. Denote by B(H) the C*-algebra of all bounded linear operators on H. We write A  ≥  0 if A is a positive semidefinite operator on H (we simply call it a positive operator), that is, A is self-adjoint and 〈Ax,x〉  ≥  0 for all x∈H. For self-adjoint A,B∈B(H), we write A  ≥  B if A - B  ≥  0. It is well known that if A  ≥  0 and B  ≥  0 then the sum A + B  ≥  0 (on H) and tensor product [formula] (on [formula]). Moreover, if A is positive then the tensor product [formula] (m copies of A) is positive (on [formula]) for any positive integer m. For the finite-dimensional case of H, we denote by λmin(A) and λmax(A) the smallest and largest eigenvalues of the positive linear operator (matrix) A on H, respectively.

In Section 2, we present an inequality for positive operators with tensor product. In Section 3, as applications of our main result, we deduce inequalities for generalized matrix functions, including determinants and permanents. Our results may be regarded as additions to the recent ones in the research development of positivity (see, e.g., [\cite=Bhatia14] [\cite=Gao14] [\cite=StanfordAIM14] [\cite=AMSMeeting15] [\cite=DBalaAMSTrans14] [\cite=LawL14] [\cite=LiZ14] [\cite=ZFZActa12]).

Main results

We present our main result in this section. The proof is accomplished by using the idea of words (which, for instance, is used to show normality of matrices in [\cite=WZ95words]). Let [formula] be a (multi-)set of operators from B(H) in which t operators are distinct. For example, t = 2 for {A1,A1,A2}. A tensor word or word of operators [formula] on H of length m and of t (distinct) representatives with respect to the tensor product [formula], symbolized by [formula], or [formula], or even simply wt (if no confusion is caused), is a tensor product

[formula]

in which [formula] are taken from [formula], and among [formula], there are t distinct operators. For instance, [formula] is a w1 word; [formula] is a w2 word, and [formula] is also a w2 word. Note that w23(A1,A2) may represent any of [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula]. So when we say a w2(A1,A2) word, we mean one of those tensor words (with the given length m = 3).

Let [formula] be positive operators. Then

[formula]

Proof. The idea of the proof is to show that all the tensor words wt with t < k representatives are cancelled out in the reduced form (after the additions and subtractions). That is, after the calculations, the only tensors that survive will be the ones of the form in the summation

[formula]

Consider the words w1, i.e., the tensors of one operator, [formula], say [formula]. The tensor [formula] appears in ([\ref=Thm2eq1]) once, in ([\ref=Thm2eq2]) [formula] times, [formula], in ([\ref=Thm2eq4]) [formula] times, and in ([\ref=Thm2eq5]) once. Therefore, after cancelation, the total number of [formula] left in the reduced form is

[formula]

Now we consider a general tensor word [formula]. Let it be a wt word with t < k, and let [formula] be the distinct representatives of [formula]. We show that [formula] vanishes in the reduced form. Since it is a wt word, it cannot be a wt - 1 word. Therefore, this wt word does not appear in the expansion of any sum-tensor [formula], s < t. That is, [formula] in ([\ref=Thm2eq3b]) is the only sum-tensor containing all [formula]. It is important to observe that a wl word contains all [formula] if and only if l  ≥  t and wl is obtained from a sum-tensor [formula], in which, after expansion, each word [formula] appears once and only once; so does [formula]. Note that for each fixed word [formula] (say, [formula]) in the sum-tensor [formula], there are [formula] many terms [formula] in the expression prior to ([\ref=Thm2eq3b]); they are

[formula]

Similarly, considering one level above, there are [formula] many terms in

[formula]

containing [formula]. Thus, going in this way up to ([\ref=Thm2eq1]), we have the total number of the [formula] word [formula] appearing in the tensors [formula] in the reduced form:

[formula]

It follows that the only remaining tensors are wk words, i.e., [formula] in which every [formula] has to appear at least once (so m  ≥  k). That is, in the reduced form, namely, after computing all expressions ([\ref=Thm2eq1]) through ([\ref=Thm2eq5]), we obtain

[formula]

If m < k, then the left hand side of the above display is 0. 7pt width 5pt depth 0pt

The inequality below is a special case of Theorem [\ref=Thm2]. We single it out as it is interesting in its own right and all our results in Section 3 rely on it.

Let A1,A2,A3∈B(H) be positive operators. Then, for any positive integer m,

[formula]

[formula]

If H is finite-dimensional, then the eigenvalues of the above difference lie between

[formula]

and

[formula]

Proof. If m = 1 or m = 2, it is straightforward to check that the difference is zero. Let m  ≥  3. From Theorem [\ref=Thm2], we have

[formula]

When the indices are taken from the set {1,2,3} and not all the same, there are 3m - 3 different terms. When the indices are taken from the 2-element sets, each summation will consist of 2m - 2 distinct tensor. Clearly, the first sum of tensors with indices from {1,2,3} contains all possible configurations of tensors in the other three sums. On the other hand, the first summation has additional tensors which contains all of the three elements from {1,2,3}. So, the last sum in above computation has exactly 3m - 3 - 3(2m - 2) = 3(3m - 1 - 2m + 1) distinct positive semidefinite entry.

For the smallest eigenvalue, since for every tensor product [formula],

[formula]

we see that the smallest eigenvalue of the difference has a lower bound

[formula]

Similarly, we arrive at an upper bound for the largest eigenvalue:

[formula]

Applications

Let H be finite-dimensional and [formula] be the tensor product space of m copies of H. Let G be a subgroup of the m-symmetric group Sm on m letters and let χ be an irreducible character on G. Denote by Vχ(G) the symmetry class of tensors associated with G and χ (see, e.g., [\cite=MerMul97]). For a linear operator A on H, the induced operator K(A) of A with respect to G and χ is the restriction of [formula] on Vχ(G); that is, [formula] (see, e.g., [\cite=MerMul97]).

So, for the positive operators A1,A2,A3 in Theorem [\ref=Thm1] with dim H  <    ∞  ,

[formula]

[formula]

that is,

[formula]

[formula]

The induced operators are closely related to generalized matrix functions (see, e.g., [\cite=MerMul97]). For the above G and χ, the generalized matrix function with respect to G and χ defined on the space of m  ×  m matrices is

[formula]

If G = Sm and χ is the signum function with values ±  1, then the generalized matrix function becomes the usual matrix determinant (det ); setting χ(σ) = 1 for each σ∈G = Sm defines the permanent ([formula]) of the matrix.

Let dim H = m and let [formula] be an orthonormal basis of H. Let P' (the transpose of P) be a matrix representation of a linear operator T on H with respect to the basis [formula]. Then (see, e.g., [\cite=MerMul97])

[formula]

where o(G) is the order of G, o(χ) is the degree of χ, and [formula] is the decomposable symmetrized tensor of [formula] ([\cite=MerMul97]).

The following result for generalized matrix functions are immediate.

Let A1,A2,A3 be m  ×  m positive semidefinite matrices. Let G be a subgroup of Sm and χ be an irreducible character of G. Then

[formula]

[formula]

The determinant and permanent inequalities follow at once.

Let A1,A2,A3 be m  ×  m positive semidefinite matrices. Then

[formula]

[formula]

Let A1,A2,A3 be m  ×  m positive semidefinite matrices. Then

[formula]

[formula]

Inequality ([\ref=det1]) is obtained by Lin in [\cite=Lin20140604] by using a majorization approach, while inequality ([\ref=dg1]) in Theorem [\ref=Thm3] confirms the strong superadditivity of the generalized matrix functions - a question raised by Lin in [\cite=Lin20140604]. Additionally, our result gives a different proof for the inequality in [\cite=PTZEla14] in which an embedding approach is employed. These results are generalizations of the classic inequalities det (A + B)  ≥   det A  +   det B and [formula] for positive semidefinite matrices A and B of the same size (see, e.g., [\cite=BYWangMul]).
