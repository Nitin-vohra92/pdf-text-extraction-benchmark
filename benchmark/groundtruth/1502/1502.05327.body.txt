Introduction

The concept of pseudotwistor (with a particular case called twistor) was introduced in [\cite=lpvo] as a general device for twisting (or deforming) the multiplication of an algebra in a monoidal category, obtaining thus a new algebra structure on the same object (informally, we call "twisted algebra" an algebra that can be obtained by deforming the multiplication of a given algebra, maybe with the help of some data on the initial algebra). Namely, if A is an algebra with multiplication [formula] in a monoidal category C, a pseudotwistor for A is a morphism [formula] in C, such that there exist two morphisms [formula] in C, called the companions of T, satisfying some axioms ensuring that [formula] is also an algebra in C. There are many classes of examples of such pseudotwistors. The one that was the starting point of [\cite=lpvo] is provided by a twisted tensor product of algebras [formula] (as in [\cite=cap], [\cite=vandaele]), which is a twisting by a twistor of the ordinary tensor product of algebras [formula]. Another class of examples is provided by braidings: if c is a braiding on a monoidal category C, then c2A,A is a pseudotwistor for every algebra A in C. The so-called Fedosov product provides another class of examples. Finally, if H is a bialgebra and [formula] is a normalized and convolution invertible left 2-cocycle, one can consider the twisted bialgebra σH, which is the associative algebra structure on H with multiplication a * b = σ(a1,b1)a2b2, for all a,b∈H; it turns out that this multiplication is afforded by the pseudotwistor

[formula]

An indication that a more general concept than pseudotwistors might exist is already implicit in two of the examples given above. For a twisted bialgebra σH, the multiplication *   is associative even if σ is not convolution invertible, but the map T given by ([\ref=cucu]) is no longer a pseudotwistor in this case. Also, if c is only a pre-braiding on a monoidal category C (i.e. we do not assume the invertibility of the morphisms c- ,  -) and (A,μ) is an algebra in C, then [formula] is still an algebra in the category but c2A,A is no longer a pseudotwistor.

However, we were led to a generalization of pseudotwistors by looking at another class of examples of twisted algebras, provided by Rota-Baxter operators. If (A,μ) is an associative algebra over a field k, with notation [formula], for a,b∈A, and λ∈k is a fixed element, a linear map R:A  →  A is called a Rota-Baxter operator of weight λ if it satisfies the relation R(a)R(b) = R(R(a)b + aR(b) + λab), for all a,b∈A. It is well-known that the new multiplication *  λ on A defined by a * λb = R(a)b + aR(b) + λab is associative. Also, it is by now well-known that Rota-Baxter operators represent a part of the algebraic component of the Connes-Kreimer approach to renormalization (see [\cite=conneskreimer], [\cite=ladder], [\cite=kreimer] and references therein). If we define the linear map [formula], [formula], for all a,b∈A, then the associative multiplication *  λ may be written as [formula], but T is far from being a pseudotwistor.

Motivated by all these examples, we introduce the following concept. Assume that (A,μ) is an algebra in a monoidal category C, [formula] and [formula] are morphisms in C such that:

[formula]

Then [formula] is also an algebra in C, denoted by AT; the morphism T is called a weak pseudotwistor for A and the morphism T is called the weak companion of T. It turns out that all the above-mentioned examples of deformed associative multiplications are afforded by weak pseudotwistors, and we provide as well some other examples, coming especially from Rota-Baxter type operators (Reynolds operators, Leroux's TD-operators etc). We present also some general properties of weak pseudotwistors.

A new class of weak pseudotwistors, coming from so-called Rota-Baxter systems, may be found in the recent paper [\cite=brzez].

In the last section we use weak pseudotwistors in order to introduce an equivalence relation for algebras in a monoidal category C: if A and B are two such algebras, we say that A and B are twist equivalent (and write [formula]) if there exists an invertible weak pseudotwistor T for A, with invertible weak companion T, such that AT and B are isomorphic as algebras. For example, if [formula] is a twisted tensor product of algebras with bijective twisting map R, then [formula].

Unless otherwise specified, the (co)algebras that will appear in this paper are not supposed to be (co)unital; if A is an associative algebra over a field k we usually denote the multiplication of A by [formula], [formula], for all a,b∈A. For the composition of two morphisms f and g we write either [formula] or simply gf. For unexplained terminology we refer to [\cite=k].

Weak pseudotwistors

We recall the concept of pseudotwistor introduced in [\cite=lpvo] (the version for nonunital algebras).

Let [formula] be a strict monoidal category, A an algebra in C with multiplication [formula] and [formula] a morphism in C. Assume that there exist two morphisms [formula] in C such that:

[formula]

Then [formula] is also an algebra in C, denoted by AT. The morphism T is called a pseudotwistor and the two morphisms T̃1, T̃2 are called the companions of T.

We recall from [\cite=psvo] the categorical analogue of the concept of R-matrix introduced in [\cite=borcherds1], [\cite=borcherds2] (also the version for nonunital algebras).

Let [formula] be a strict monoidal category, A an algebra in C with multiplication [formula] and [formula] a morphism in C. Assume that there exist two morphisms [formula] in C such that:

[formula]

Then [formula] is also an algebra in C, denoted by AT. The morphism T is called an R-matrix and the two morphisms [formula], [formula] are called the companions of T.

We introduce now a common generalization of these two concepts.

Let [formula] be a strict monoidal category, A an algebra in C with multiplication [formula] and [formula] a morphism in C. Assume that there exists a morphism [formula] in C such that:

[formula]

Then [formula] is also an algebra in C, denoted by AT. The morphism T is called a weak pseudotwistor and the morphism T is called the weak companion of T.

We compute:

[formula]

finishing the proof.

If T is a pseudotwistor with companions T̃1, T̃2 on an algebra A, then T is also a weak pseudotwistor, with weak companion [formula].

Conversely, an invertible weak pseudotwistor T with weak companion T on an algebra A is a pseudotwistor, with companions [formula] and [formula].

If T is an R-matrix with companions [formula], [formula] on an algebra A, then T is a weak pseudotwistor, with weak companion [formula].

Conversely, an invertible weak pseudotwistor T with weak companion T on an algebra A is an R-matrix, with companions [formula] and [formula].

Let A be an associative unital algebra with unit 1A over a field k. In [\cite=lebed] was considered the following linear map:

[formula]

The associativity of the multiplication of A is equivalent to the fact that this map T is a Yang-Baxter operator, cf. [\cite=lebed].

One can check, by a direct computation, that T is a pseudotwistor (in particular, a weak pseudotwistor) with companions [formula] and [formula], for all a,b,c∈A, and obviously AT = A.

It is possible to have an associative algebra A over a field k, a linear map [formula] that is not a weak pseudotwistor but such that [formula] is associative. Indeed, for a given associative algebra A, the linear map [formula], [formula], for all a,b∈A, has the property that [formula] is associative (of course, it is just the multiplication of Aop) but, in general, T is not a weak pseudotwistor (although it may be, for some particular algebras A). We give a concrete example of an associative algebra A for which T is not a weak pseudotwistor. We take A to be a 2-dimensional associative algebra over a field k with a linear basis {x,y} with multiplication table x  ·  x = x  ·  y = y  ·  x = y  ·  y = x. We claim that there exists no linear map [formula] such that [formula]. Suppose that such a map exists. We have [formula]. If we write [formula], with a1,...,a8∈k, then we have [formula], and this element cannot be equal to [formula].

Let [formula] be a strict monoidal category and [formula] a family of natural morphisms in C such that, for all X,Y,Z∈C, we have:

[formula]

It was proved in [\cite=psvo] that if for all X,Y∈C the morphism TX,Y is an isomorphism, then, for every algebra (A,μ) in C, the morphism [formula] is a pseudotwistor. If we do not assume the invertibility of the morphisms TX,Y, then TA,A is no longer a pseudotwistor.

TA,A is a weak pseudotwistor.

The identity ([\ref=laycle]) for X = Y = Z = A becomes [formula]; we denote by T this morphism from [formula] to [formula]. The naturality of T implies that [formula] and [formula], hence:

[formula]

proving that TA,A is a weak pseudotwistor with weak companion T.

([\cite=cap], [\cite=vandaele]) Let [formula] be a strict monoidal category and (A,μA), (B,μB) two algebras in C. A twisting map between A and B is a morphism [formula] in C satisfying the conditions:

[formula]

The next result generalizes [\cite=lpvo], Theorem 6.6 (iii).

Let [formula] be a strict monoidal category and (A,μ) an algebra in C. Assume that [formula] are two twisting maps between A and itself, such that:

[formula]

Then [formula] is a weak pseudotwistor.

Because of ([\ref=(6.10)]) and ([\ref=(6.11)]), we have the following equality:

[formula]

This morphism from [formula] to [formula] will be denoted by T. Now we compute:

[formula]

[formula]

so T is a weak pseudotwistor with weak companion T.

Let [formula] be a strict monoidal category and [formula] a pre-braiding on C (that is c satisfies all the axioms of a braiding as in [\cite=k] except for the fact that we do not require cX,Y to be invertible). Let (A,μ) be an algebra in C. Then [formula] is a weak pseudotwistor.

It is either a consequence of Proposition [\ref=weaklaycle], by noting that the family of natural morphisms [formula] satisfies ([\ref=laycle]), or a consequence of Proposition [\ref=2twmaps], applied to the twisting maps Q = P = cA,A.

Let H be a bialgebra over a field k, with multiplication [formula], [formula], for h,h'∈H, and comultiplication [formula], for which we use a Sweedler-type notation [formula], for h∈H. Let [formula] be a left 2-cocycle, that is we have σ(a1,b1)σ(a2b2,c) = σ(b1,c1)σ(a,b2c2), for all a,b,c∈H. It is well-known that, if we define a new multiplication on H, by a * b = σ(a1,b1)a2b2, for all a,b∈H, then this multiplication is associative and the new algebra structure on H is denoted by σH and called "twisted bialgebra".

Define the linear map [formula], [formula], for all a,b∈H. It was proved in [\cite=lpvo] that, if H is unital and counital and σ is convolution invertible with inverse σ- 1, then T is a pseudotwistor, with companions [formula], [formula] and [formula].

If σ is not convolution invertible, T is no longer a pseudotwistor. However, T is a weak pseudotwistor, with weak companion [formula], [formula], for all a,b,c∈H, as one can easily check.

There exist "mirror versions" of these facts. Namely, let [formula] be a right 2-cocycle, i.e. τ satisfies the condition τ(a1b1,c)τ(a2,b2) = τ(a,b1c1)τ(b2,c2), for all a,b,c∈H. If we define a new multiplication on H by a * b = a1b1τ(a2,b2), for all a,b∈H, then this multiplication is associative and the new algebra structure is denoted by Hτ and called also "twisted bialgebra". This multiplication is afforded by the weak pseudotwistor [formula], [formula], whose weak companion is the linear map [formula], [formula].

Let A be an associative algebra with unit 1 over a field k and λ,θ,ν∈k some fixed scalars. In [\cite=dn] was considered the following linear map:

[formula]

Then one can easily check that T is a weak pseudotwistor with weak companion [formula], [formula], for all a,b,c∈A.

Let (A,μ) be an associative algebra. We regard [formula] as an A-bimodule in the usual way: [formula], for all a,b,c,d∈A. Let [formula] be a linear map, with Sweedler-type notation [formula], that is a morphism of A-bimodules, i.e.

[formula]

for all a,b∈A. Define the linear map [formula], [formula]. Then T satisfies the following relations (with standard notation for T12, T13, T23):

[formula]

Consequently, T is a weak pseudotwistor with weak companion [formula], and the new multiplication on A defined by a * b = b1ab2 is associative.

We compute:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

finishing the proof.

The definition of the multiplication *   in Proposition [\ref=bimod] is inspired by the result of Aguiar from [\cite=aguiar], showing that if (A,μ,Δ) is an infinitesimal bialgebra (i.e. [formula] is a coassociative derivation) then the new product on A defined by [formula] is pre-Lie.

Let [formula] be a strict monoidal category and (A,μ) an algebra in C. Assume that T and D are two weak pseudotwistors for A, with weak companions T and respectively D, such that the following conditions are satisfied:

[formula]

Then [formula] is a weak pseudotwistor for A, with weak companion [formula].

We compute:

[formula]

[formula]

finishing the proof.

Let [formula] be a strict monoidal category and (A,μ) an algebra in C. Assume that T and D are two weak pseudotwistors for A, with weak companions T and respectively D, such that the following conditions are satisfied:

[formula]

Then [formula] is a weak pseudotwistor for A, with weak companion [formula].

We check ([\ref=tarecomp1]), while ([\ref=tarecomp2]) is similar and left to the reader:

[formula]

finishing the proof.

Let H be a bialgebra over a field k as in Example [\ref=cocycles], σ (respectively τ) a left (respectively right) 2-cocycle on H and T and D the weak pseudotwistors defined in Example [\ref=cocycles]. The multiplication defined on H by

[formula]

is associative. We can obtain this as consequence of Corollary [\ref=twopstw]. It is obvious that [formula], so ([\ref=comp1]) is satisfied. It is easy to see that ([\ref=comp2]) and ([\ref=comp3]) are satisfied too, so [formula] is a weak pseudotwistor and clearly [formula] is exactly the multiplication *   defined by ([\ref=star]).

We present now another application of Proposition [\ref=taretwopstw], generalizing Remark 4.11 in [\cite=psvo]:

Let [formula] be a strict monoidal category, (A,μ) an algebra in C, [formula] a weak pseudotwistor with weak companion T and [formula] a family of natural morphisms in C satisfying ([\ref=laycle]). Then [formula] is a weak pseudotwistor for A.

The naturality of DX,Y implies:

[formula]

By composing on the right with [formula] and respectively [formula] we obtain:

[formula]

The weak companion of DA,A is [formula], so we obtained ([\ref=tarecomp1]) and ([\ref=tarecomp2]).

Let [formula] be a strict monoidal category, (A,μ) an algebra in C and [formula] a weak pseudotwistor. In view of Example [\ref=cocycles], we may think of T as some sort of 2-cocycle for A. We will see that we can define as well some sort of 2-coboundaries.

Let [formula] be a strict monoidal category and (A,μ) an algebra in C. Assume that we are given a triple (f,F,F), where f:A  →  A, [formula] and [formula] are morphisms in C satisfying the following conditions:

[formula]

Then the morphism [formula], [formula] is a weak pseudotwistor with weak companion [formula], [formula]. We denote ∂(f,F) = D and call such a weak pseudotwistor 2-coboundary for A. Moreover, f is an algebra homomorphism from A∂(f,F) to A, so in particular if f is invertible then A∂(f,F) and A are isomorphic as algebras.

We check ([\ref=wp1]) for D and D, while ([\ref=wp2]) is similar and left to the reader:

[formula]

The fact that f is an algebra homomorphism A∂(f,F)  →  A follows immediately from ([\ref=cob3]).

Let [formula] be a strict monoidal category and RX:X  →  X a family of natural isomorphisms in C. If (A,μ) is an algebra in C, then f: = RA, [formula] and [formula] satisfy the hypotheses of Proposition [\ref=2coboundaries]. Indeed, the naturality of R implies [formula], which is ([\ref=cob1]), [formula], which is ([\ref=cob2]), and [formula], which is ([\ref=cob3]).

Another example will be given in the next section.

Rota-Baxter type operators

We recall (see for instance the recent survey [\cite=patras] and references therein) the concept of Rota-Baxter operator. Let (A,μ) be an associative algebra over a field k and λ∈k a fixed element. A linear map R:A  →  A is called a Rota-Baxter operator of weight λ if it satisfies the relation

[formula]

If this is the case, the new multiplication *  λ on A defined by

[formula]

and called the double product, is associative and R is an algebra map from (A,  *  λ) to (A,μ).

If R:A  →  A is a Rota-Baxter operator of weight λ on an algebra (A,μ) as above, then the linear map

[formula]

is a weak pseudotwistor with weak companion [formula],

[formula]

and the new associative product [formula] on A coincides with the double product *  λ.

Obviously [formula] coincides with *  λ, so we only need to prove that T is a weak pseudotwistor. We compute, for a,b,c∈A:

[formula]

A similar computation shows that: [formula].

Let A be an associative algebra over a field k and β,γ:A  →  A two commuting Rota-Baxter operators of weight 0. It was proved in [\cite=quadrialgebras] (as a consequence of the fact that, via β and γ, A becomes a so-called quadri-algebra) that the new multiplication defined on A by

[formula]

is associative. We want to obtain this as a consequence of Corollary [\ref=twopstw]. By Proposition [\ref=RotaBaxter], we can consider the weak pseudotwistors [formula],

[formula]

with weak companions T and respectively D defined by

[formula]

Since γ and β commute, it is obvious that [formula], so ([\ref=comp1]) is satisfied. An easy computation shows that ([\ref=comp2]) and ([\ref=comp3]) are also satisfied, so [formula] is a weak pseudotwistor and obviously [formula] is exactly the multiplication ([\ref=2RB]).

Let A be an associative algebra over a field k and R:A  →  A a bijective Rota-Baxter operator of weight λ, with inverse R- 1. Then the linear maps f: = R, [formula], [formula], and [formula], [formula], satisfy the hypotheses of Proposition [\ref=2coboundaries], as one can easily check, and the weak pseudotwistor ∂(f,F) (notation as in Proposition [\ref=2coboundaries]) is the one defined by ([\ref=RBpstw]).

Bijective Rota-Baxter operators exist. For example, if A is an associative algebra over a field k and λ∈k, λ  ≠  0, then the (bijective) linear map R:A  →  A, R(a) =  - λa, for all a∈A, is a Rota-Baxter operator of weight λ, cf. [\cite=guodifferential].

Let A be an associative algebra over a field k and α,β:A  →  A two linear maps. A linear map R:A  →  A will be called an (α,β)-Rota-Baxter operator if the following conditions are satisfied, for all a,b∈A:

[formula]

Obviously, an (idA,idA)-Rota-Baxter operator is just a Rota-Baxter operator of weight 0. A nontrivial example (who actually inspired this concept) may be found in [\cite=twisteddendriform]: A is the algebra of continuous functions on [formula] with values in some unital algebra B, q is a number with 0 < q < 1, α = idA, β = Mq is the q-dilation operator and R = Iq is the Jackson q-integral. Then formula (20) in [\cite=twisteddendriform] says exactly that R is an (α,β)-Rota-Baxter operator.

If R is an (α,β)-Rota-Baxter operator as above, then the linear map

[formula]

is a weak pseudotwistor with weak companion [formula],

[formula]

Consequently, the new multiplication defined on A by the formula a * b = α(R(a))b + aβ(R(b)), for all a,b∈A, is associative.

Follows by a direct computation.

Let A be an associative algebra over a field k and R:A  →  A a so-called Reynolds operator (see for instance [\cite=uchinotwisting]), that is R satisfies the following condition:

[formula]

If one defines a new multiplication on A, by

[formula]

then (for instance as a consequence of the theory developped in [\cite=uchinoquantum]) *   is associative.

If we define the linear map

[formula]

then one can check, by a direct computation, that T is a weak pseudotwistor, with weak companion [formula], [formula], and the resulting associative multiplication [formula] coincides with *  .

We recall from [\cite=leroux1] that, if (A,μ) is an associative unital algebra with unit 1A over a field k, a linear map P:A  →  A is called a TD-operator if

[formula]

If this is the case, the new multiplication defined on A by a * b = P(a)b + aP(b) - aP(1A)b, for all a,b∈A, is associative.

If P:A  →  A is a TD-operator, then the linear map [formula], [formula], for all a,b∈A, is a weak pseudotwistor with weak companion [formula], [formula], and the associative multiplications *   and [formula] coincide.

A straightforward computation, by using also the identity P(1A)P(a) = P(a)P(1A), for all a∈A, which follows immediately from ([\ref=TDop]).

We recall from [\cite=leroux2] that, if (A,μ) is an associative algebra over a field k, a right (respectively left) Baxter operator on A is a linear map P:A  →  A (respectively Q:A  →  A) such that P(a)P(b) = P(P(a)b) (respectively Q(a)Q(b) = Q(aQ(b)), for all a,b∈A. If moreover P and Q commute, then, by [\cite=leroux2], Theorem 2.10, the new multiplication defined on A by a * b = P(a)Q(b), for all a,b∈A, is associative. By a straightforward computation, one proves the following result:

The linear map [formula], [formula], is a weak pseudotwistor, with weak companion [formula], [formula], and the associative multiplications *   and [formula] coincide.

An equivalence relation

Let [formula] be a strict monoidal category and A an algebra in C. Then [formula] is a weak pseudotwistor for A, with weak companion [formula], and AT = A.

Let [formula] be a strict monoidal category and (A,μ) an algebra in C. Let [formula] be a weak pseudotwistor for A with weak companion T and [formula] a weak pseudotwistor for AT with weak companion D. Then [formula] is a weak pseudotwistor for A with weak companion [formula], and [formula].

We prove ([\ref=wp1]), while ([\ref=wp2]) is similar and left to the reader:

[formula]

The fact that [formula] is obvious.

Let [formula] be a strict monoidal category, (A,μ) an algebra in C and [formula] a weak pseudotwistor for A with weak companion T, such that T and T are invertible. Then T- 1 is a weak pseudotwistor for AT with weak companion T- 1, and (AT)T- 1 = A.

We prove ([\ref=wp1]) and leave ([\ref=wp2]) to the reader. We need to prove that

[formula]

This is obviously equivalent to

[formula]

The fact that (AT)T- 1 = A is obvious.

Let [formula] be a strict monoidal category, (A,μA) and (B,μB) two algebras in C, f:A  →  B an algebra isomorphism and [formula] a weak pseudotwistor for A with weak companion T. Then [formula] is a weak pseudotwistor for B with weak companion [formula], and f is also an algebra isomorphism from AT to BD.

We prove ([\ref=wp1]) for D and leave ([\ref=wp2]) to the reader:

[formula]

The fact that f is an algebra morphism from AT to BD follows from the fact that [formula].

Let [formula] be a strict monoidal category and (A,μA), (B,μB) two algebras in C. We will say that A and B are twist equivalent, and write [formula], if there exists an invertible weak pseudotwistor T for A, with invertible weak companion T, such that AT and B are isomorphic as algebras.

In view of Remark [\ref=echival], we have [formula] if and only if there exists an invertible pseudotwistor T for A, with invertible companions T̃1 and T̃2, such that AT and B are isomorphic as algebras, if and only if there exists an invertible R-matrix T for A, with invertible companions [formula] and [formula], such that AT and B are isomorphic as algebras.

Obviously, two isomorphic algebras are twist equivalent.

As a consequence of the above results, we obtain:

[formula] is an equivalence relation.

In the setting of Example [\ref=cocycles], if σ (respectively τ) is a convolution invertible left (respectively right) 2-cocycle, then [formula] and [formula].

Let (A,μA) and (B,μB) be two associative algebras over a field k and [formula] a twisting map, with Sweedler-type notation [formula], for a∈A, b∈B. We can consider the twisted tensor product [formula] (cf. [\cite=cap], [\cite=vandaele]), which is the associative algebra structure on the linear space [formula] given by the multiplication [formula], for a,a'∈A, b,b'∈B. Define the linear map

[formula]

By [\cite=lpvo], T is a so-called twistor for the associative algebra [formula], in particular it is a weak pseudotwistor with weak companion

[formula]

where r and R are two more copies of R; moreover, we have that [formula].

Assume now that R is a bijective map. Then obviously T and T are also bijective, hence [formula].

Note added. We used the term "Rota-Baxter type operator" in an informal way, to designate an operator that is "similar" to a Rota-Baxter operator. Professor Li Guo kindly draw out attention to the paper [\cite=RBTO], where this term was introduced as a rigorous concept and moreover a conjectural list of possible Rota-Baxter type operators was proposed.
