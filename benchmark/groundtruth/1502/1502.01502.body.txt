Introduction

Let H be a fixed graph. The Turán number of H, denoted ex(n,H), is the maximum number of edges a graph with n vertices can have, which contains no copy of H. The Erd os-Stone theorem from [\cite=ES1946] gives an asymptotic formula for the Turán number of any non-bipartite graph, and this formula depends on the chromatic number of the graph H.

When H is a complete bipartite graph, determining the Turán number is related to the "Zarankiewicz problem" (see [\cite=B], Chap. VI, Sect.2, and [\cite=Furedi1996b] for more details and references). In many cases even the question of determining the right order of magnitude for ex(n,H) is not known.

Let Kt,s denote the complete bipartite graph with t vertices in one class and s vertices in the other. K ovari, Sós and Turán [\cite=KST1954] proved that for [formula]

[formula]

The norm graph Γ(t), which we will define the next section, has n vertices and about [formula] edges. In [\cite=ARS1999] (based on results from [\cite=KRS1996]) it was proven that the graph Γ(t) contains no copy of Kt,(t - 1)! + 1, thus proving that for [formula],

[formula]

for some constant c.

In [\cite=BP2012], it was shown that Γ(4) contains no copy of K5,5, which improves on the probabilistic lower bound of Erd os and Spencer [\cite=ES1974] for ex(n,K5,5). In this article, we will generalise this result and prove that Γ(t) contains no copy of Kt + 1,(t - 1)! - 1. For [formula], this does not improve the probabilistic lower bound of Erd os and Spencer,

[formula]

As far as we are aware, it is however the deterministic construction of a graph with n vertices containing no Kt + 1,(t - 1)! - 1 with the most edges.

The norm graph

Suppose that q = ph, where p is a prime, and denote by [formula] the finite field with q elements. We will use the following properties of finite fields. For any [formula], (a + b)pi = api + bpi, for any [formula]. Note that (a - b)pi = api - bpi, since either pi is odd or - 1 = 1. Secondly, for all [formula], aq = a if and only if [formula]. Finally [formula], for all [formula], since N(a)q = N(a).

Let [formula] denote an arbitrary field. We denote by [formula] the projective space arising from the (n + 1)-dimensional vector space over [formula]. Throughout dim  will refer to projective dimension. A point of [formula] (which is a one-dimensional subspace of the vector space) will often be written as 〈u〉, where u is a vector in the (n + 1)-dimensional vector space over [formula].

Let Γ(t) be the graph with vertices [formula], α  ≠  0, where (a,α) is joined to (a',α') if and only if N(a + a') = αα'. The graph Γ(t) was constructed in [\cite=KRS1996], where it was shown to contain no copy of Kt,t! + 1. In [\cite=ARS1999] Alon, Rónyai and Szabó proved that Γ(t) contains no copy of Kt,(t - 1)! + 1. Our aim here is to show that it also contains no Kt + 1,(t - 1)! - 1, generalizing the same result for t = 5 presented in [\cite=BP2012].

Let

[formula]

The set V is the affine part of an algebraic variety that is in turn a subvariety of the Segre variety

[formula]

where [formula].

The affine point [formula] has coordinates indexed by the subsets of [formula], where the S-coordinate is

[formula]

for any non-empty subset S of T and

[formula]

when [formula] (see [\cite=Pepe2011]).

Let n = 2t - 1 - 1.

We order the coordinates of [formula] so that if the i-th coordinate corresponds to the subset S, then the (n - i)-th coordinate corresponds to the subset [formula].

Embed the [formula] containing V as a hyperplane section of [formula] defined by the equation xn + 1 = 0.

Let β be the symmetric bilinear form on the (n + 2)-dimensional vector space over [formula] defined by

[formula]

Let [formula] be defined in the usual way, so that given a subspace Π of [formula], [formula] is the subspace of [formula] defined by

[formula]

We wish to define the same graph Γ(t), so that adjacency is given by the bilinear form. Let [formula]. Let Γ' be a graph with vertex set the set of points on the lines joining the points of V to P∞ obtained using only scalars in [formula], distinct from P∞ and not contained in the hyperplane xn + 1 = 0. Join two vertices 〈u〉 and 〈u'〉 in Γ' if and only if β(u,u') = 0. It is a simple matter to verify that the graph Γ' is isomorphic to the graph Γ(t) since

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

We shall refer to Γ' as Γ(t) from now on.

We recall some known properties of Σ and its subvariety

[formula]

and prove a new one in Theorem [\ref=main].

Let [formula] denote the algebraic closure of [formula] and consider Σ as the Segre variety over [formula].

Σ is a smooth irreducible variety.

The dimension of Σ (as algebraic variety) is t - 1 and its degree is (t - 1)!.

[\cite=Pepe2011] Any t points of V are in general position.

[\cite=GP] If t + 1 points span a (t - 1)-dimensional projective space, then that space contains q + 1 points of V.

If a subspace of codimension t contains a finite number of points of Σ then it contains at most (t - 1)! - 2 points of Σ.

By Theorem [\ref=smooth], Σ is smooth, so it is regular at each of its points, i.e., if TPΣ is the tangent space of Σ at a point P∈Σ, then dim TPΣ = t - 1.

Let Π be a subspace of codimension t containing a finite number of points of Σ. Let [formula]. Then [formula]. Therefore, there is a hyperplane H containing 〈TPΣ,Π〉.

Suppose that H contains another tangent space TRΣ, with [formula]. The algebraic variety [formula] has dimension t - 2 (since Σ is irreducible) and it has two singular points, P and R. Since [formula] as an algebraic variety, there must be a linear subspace Π1 of codimension t - 2 in H containing Π and such that [formula] consists of [formula] points of Σ counted with their multiplicity. Since Π1 contains P and R, which are singular points and so with multiplicity at least 2, we have that

[formula]

Suppose now that H does not contain any other tangent space TRΣ with [formula], R  ≠  P. Then take [formula] and consider a hyperplane H'  ≠  H containing 〈TRΣ,Π〉. Then the tangent spaces of P and R with respect to [formula] are [formula] and [formula], and they both have dimension t - 2 (as linear spaces).

If [formula] as an algebraic variety, then P and R are two singular points of [formula] and we can find, as before, a linear subspace Π1 of codimension t - 3 in [formula] such that it contains Π and intersects [formula] in [formula] points, counted with their multiplicity. Since P and R have multiplicity at least 2, we have

[formula]

If [formula] as an algebraic variety, then [formula] is reducible. Hence, we have

[formula]

where Vi is an irreducible variety of dimension t - 2, for all [formula]. So we have

[formula]

where Wi is a hyperplane section of Vi, for all [formula]. We observe that also [formula] has to be reducible and, since the decomposition in irreducible components is unique, we have

[formula]

where Vi and V'j are irreducible varieties of dimension t - 2.

We have, by hypothesis, that TPΣ  ⊂  H and P∈Π. So either P∈Vi and it is singular for Vi, for some [formula], or it is not singular for [formula], for any [formula].

Suppose we are in the first case. We know that P∈Π  ⊂  H'. If Vi  ⊆  H', then P is singular for an irreducible component of [formula] and so TPΣ  ⊂  H', contradicting our hypothesis, so Vi is not contained in H' and [formula]. We have that [formula] (as linear subspace) and dim Wi = t - 3 (as algebraic variety), so P is singular for Wi.

Suppose now that P is not singular for any Vi, so the dimension of TPVi, as a subspace, is t - 2. If [formula], for any i  ≠  j, then

[formula]

a contradiction since the dimension of TP(Σ) is t - 1. Hence [formula], and so P is contained in the intersection of two components of [formula], so it is again a singular (or multiple) point. The same is true for the point R such that TRΣ  ⊂  H', so in

[formula]

there are at least two multiple points and when we sum up all the degrees, we count at least two points twice, hence, by

[formula]

we get that the number of points in

[formula]

is at most (t - 1)! - 2.

Remark One could wonder whether one could try with one more hyperplane H'' such that TQΣ  ⊂  H'', [formula],[formula]' and Q∈Π. However, it can happen that [formula], so [formula] (as linear space) and [formula], so Q would not be a singular point of

[formula]

For [formula] the graph Γ(t) contains no Kt + 1,(t - 1)! - 1.

Let [formula] be t + 1 distinct vertices of Γ(t). The set of common neighbours of the elements of X is [formula], where Π is the subspace spanned by X. If any two elements of X project from P∞ onto the same point of V, then P∞∈Π and hence [formula]. Since [formula] is the hyperplane xn + 1 = 0, [formula], and the elements of X have no common neighbour.

Therefore, we assume now that all the points in X project from P∞ onto distinct points of V. Then, by Theorem [\ref=independence1], [formula].

If dim Π = t - 1, then by Theorem [\ref=independence1], the projection of Π onto V contains at least q points of V. Therefore, there are at least q points Y of Π on the lines joining P∞ to the points of V. We wish to prove that the points of Y are vertices of the graph Γ(t). To do this, we have to show that the points of Y, which are of the form 〈(v,λ)〉, where v∈V and [formula], are of the form 〈(v,λ)〉, where v∈V and [formula]. Assuming that the vertices in X have at least two common neighbours, we can suppose that there is a common neighbour of the elements of X of the form 〈(u,μ)〉, where u∈V, u  ≠   - v and [formula], is a common neighbour of the elements of X. Then 〈(u,μ)〉 is in [formula] and since Y  ⊂  Π,

[formula]

Since [formula] and [formula], we have that [formula] and so the points of Y are vertices of the graph Γ(t). Therefore, the vertices of X have at least q common neighbours. Since Γ contains no Kt,(t - 1)! + 1, if [formula], then this case cannot occur.

If dim Π = t then [formula]. Let Y be the points of [formula] which project from P∞ onto V. Arguing as in the previous paragraph, the points Y are vertices of the graph Γ(t). Since the vertices of X have at most (t - 1)! + 1 common neighbours, there are a finite number of points in Y and so a finite number of points in the projection of [formula] onto V. By Theorem [\ref=main], this projection contains at most (t - 1)! - 2 points of V, so there are at most (t - 1)! - 2 points in Y. Therefore, the vertices in X have at most (t - 1)! - 2 common neighbours.
