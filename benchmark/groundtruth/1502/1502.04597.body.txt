Isomonodromic deformation of q-difference equations and confluence

Introduction

The study of isomonodromic deformation and Painlev� equations in the framework q-difference equations have obtained many contributions. See [\cite=Bor] [\cite=GNP] [\cite=KK] [\cite=KMN] [\cite=NRG] [\cite=PNG] [\cite=RGH] [\cite=Sak] [\cite=S06]. In [\cite=JS], Jimbo and Sakai have introduced a q-analogue of Painlev� sixth equation. Analogously to what happens in the differential case, the equation appears after considering an isomonodromic deformation of a q-difference equation. More precisely, let [formula] with |q| > 1, and let us define the q-difference operator σq,

[formula]

A q-difference equation may be seen as a discretization of a differential equation, since [formula] converges to the derivation [formula] when q goes to 1. This leads Jimbo and Sakai to consider a q-deformation of the differential equation that is relevant for the sixth Painlev� equation:

[formula]

where [formula], A0,A1,At are 2  ×  2 complex matrices, t denotes a parameter that belongs to U, an open connected subset of [formula] stable under σq, and [formula] denotes the identity matrix. Then, under convenient assumptions, Jimbo and Sakai construct invertible matrix solutions, Y0,Y∞, at z = 0 and z =   ∞   of ([\ref=eq0]) and consider the Birkhoff connexion matrix P(z,t): = Y- 1∞(z,t)Y0(z,t), which play a role that is analogous to that of the monodromy matrices for differential equations. Then, the authors of [\cite=JS] find a necessary and sufficient condition so that the matrix P is pseudo constant, that is for all t∈U, P(z,t) = P(z,qt). The condition they found is the existence of an invertible matrix z  ↦  B(z,t) having coefficients in [formula], such that

[formula]

Moreover, the matrix B satisfies

[formula]

which leads Jimbo and Sakai to the definition of the q-analogue of the sixth Painlev� equation.

Many objects that appear in the Galois theory of q-difference equations may be seen as q-analogues of the corresponding objects that appear in the Galois theory of differential equations. See [\cite=Ad29] [\cite=Be] [\cite=Ca] [\cite=D4] [\cite=DE] [\cite=DR] [\cite=DSK] [\cite=DV02] [\cite=GR] [\cite=MZ] [\cite=R92] [\cite=Ro11] [\cite=RS14] [\cite=RSZ] [\cite=RZ] [\cite=S00] [\cite=Trj] [\cite=vdPR] [\cite=Z02]. The convergence of the operator [formula] to [formula] when q goes to 1 leads to the study of the confluence of these objects. Confluence of solutions of Fuchsian linear q-difference systems has been considered in [\cite=S00]. Let us summarize the work of Sauloy. Considering a convenient family of q-difference systems of the form

[formula]

how do behave the solutions Y0,Y∞ at z = 0 and z =   ∞  , when q goes to 1? Contrary to [\cite=JS], to construct the solutions Y0 and Y∞, the author of [\cite=S00] uses only functions that are meromorphic on [formula], rather than multivalued functions. Assume that A(z,q) converges to [formula] in a convenient way. Under reasonable assumptions, Sauloy proves that the univalued solutions Y0,Y∞ converge when q goes to 1 in a convenient way, to multivalued solutions of the linear differential system [formula]. Then, he obtains that the Birkhoff connexion matrix P(z,q) = Y- 1∞(z,t)Y0(z,t) converges to a locally constant matrix [formula] when q goes to 1. In [\cite=S00], it is shown that the monodromy matrices at the intermediates singularities (those different from 0 and ∞  ) of the linear differential system [formula] can be expressed with the values of [formula].

The main goal of this paper is the following. Can we use the reasoning of Sauloy to study the behaviour when q goes to 1, of the Birkhoff connexion matrix that is involved in the definition of the q-analogue of the sixth Painlev� equation?

The paper is organized as follows. In §, we make a reminder of the local study of Fuchsian linear q-difference equations. We introduce the meromorphic functions we will use to solve Fuchsian linear q-difference systems and we define the Birkhoff connexion matrix. In §, we adapt the work of Jimbo and Sakai to a different situation and with using meromorphic solutions on [formula] rather than multivalued functions. In particular, we study in general isomonodromic deformation of Fuchsian linear q-difference systems. In § we use the work of Sauloy to state a result of convergence of the Birkhoff connexion matrix when q goes to 1. See Theorem [\ref=theo1]. Finally in §, we apply this result to ([\ref=eq0]), the equation that leads the authors of [\cite=JS] to the q-analogue of the sixth Painlev� equation. Unfortunately, ([\ref=eq0]) does not behave very well when q goes to 1. In particular, we prove that the Birkhoff connexion matrix of ([\ref=eq0]) equals to the product of a Birkhoff connexion matrix of another system, that converges when q goes to 1, and matrices that do not behave well when q goes to 1, but that we might express explicitly. See Theorem [\ref=theo2].

Fuchsian linear q-difference systems

We are going to remind in this section how to solve Fuchsian linear q-difference systems using meromorphic functions on [formula]. Let us fix q a complex number with |q| > 1. For R a ring and [formula], let [formula] be the field of invertible ν  ×  ν matrices in coefficients in R. Let us fix log , a determination of the logarithm over [formula], the Riemann surface of the logarithm. For [formula], we are going to write qa instead of ea log (q). For [formula], let [formula]. Let us consider the linear q-difference system of rank [formula]:

[formula]

Let us assume that A has no poles at 0 and ∞  . Let us also assume that A0: = A(0), (resp. A∞: = A(  ∞  )) is invertible.

To solve ([\ref=eq1]), we are going to introduce three meromorphic functions on [formula],

[formula]

[formula] with [formula], and [formula]. They satisfy the q-difference equations:

σqΘq(z) = zΘq(z).

σqΛq,a(z) = aΛq,a(z).

σqlq = lq + 1.

The theta function Θq(z) is analytic on [formula] and has zeroes of order 1 in the q-spiral [formula]. The function Λq,a has poles of order 1 in the q-spiral [formula], and zeroes of order 1 in the q-spiral [formula].

Let B be an invertible matrix with complex coefficients and consider now the decomposition in Jordan normal form B = P(DU)P- 1, where [formula] is diagonal, U is a unipotent upper triangular matrix with DU = UD, and P is an invertible matrix with complex coefficients. Following [\cite=S00], we construct the matrix:

[formula]

that satisfies:

[formula]

Let [formula] and consider the corresponding matrix [formula]. By construction, we have Λq,b  =  Λq,(b).

Let μ0 be the valuation of R (resp. μ∞ be the degree of R) et let r0 (resp. r∞) be the value of z-  μ0R at z = 0 (resp. z-  μ∞R at z =   ∞  ). Assume that the distinct eigenvalues of A0 (resp. A∞) are distinct modulo [formula]. Let [formula] be the ring of germs of analytic functions at z = 0. As we can see in [\cite=S00], §1, there exist two invertible matrices with entries that are meromorphic on [formula], solution of ([\ref=eq1]), of the form

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula], and [formula].

Let [formula] be the poles of A, (resp. [formula] be the eigenvalues of A0). From [\cite=S00], §1, it follows that

Y0 has its poles contained in the q-spirals [formula], and [formula].

Y- 1∞ has its poles contained in the q-spirals [formula], and [formula].

The Birkhoff connection matrix is defined by

[formula]

It satisfies σqP = P, i.e., the entries of P belong to the field of meromorphic functions over the torus [formula]. This field can be identified with the field of elliptic functions. Therefore, the entries of P may be written in terms of theta functions. Note that it plays an analogue role to that of the monodromy matrices for differential equations. The entries of P are meromorphic on [formula] with poles contained in the q-spirals, [formula], [formula].

Connection preserving deformation

In this section, we are going to prove that under convenient assumptions, the work of Jimbo and Sakai, see §, stay valid in a different situation and with using the meromorphic solutions of § rather than multivalued functions.

Following [\cite=JS], we consider the linear q-difference system,

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula]. Here t denotes a complex parameter belonging to [formula], an open connected set that is stable under σq. Let us assume that:

For all t∈U, the matrix A has no poles at 0 and ∞  . Let us also assume that A0: = A(0,t), (resp. A∞: = A(  ∞  ,t)) is invertible, does not depend upon t, with distinct eigenvalues that are distinct modulo [formula].

Each poles of z  ↦  A(z,t) is proportional to t or does not depend upon t.

The valuation and the degree of R are independent of t. Let μ0 be the valuation of R (resp. μ∞ be the degree of R). Assume that r0(t) (resp. r∞(t)), the value of z-  μ0R(z,t) at z = 0 (resp. z-  μ∞R(z,t) at z =   ∞  ) satisfies for all t∈U, [formula] (resp. [formula]).

Let

[formula]

[formula]

be the solutions of ([\ref=eq2]) defined in §. Let [formula] be the poles of A(z,t). Without loss of generalities, we may assume the existence of integer m1, such that [formula] are proportional to t and [formula] do not depend upon t. Now, we are going to determine a necessary and sufficient condition so that, for all values of the parameter t∈U, the Birkhoff connection matrix P(z,t):  =  Y -  1 ∞ (z,t)Y0(z,t) is pseudo constant, that is for all t∈U,

[formula]

The next proposition is analogous to [\cite=JS], Proposition 2.

The Birkhoff connection matrix P is pseudo constant if and only if

[formula]

Using the description of the poles of Y0 and Y- 1∞, their construction, see §, and the assumptions on r0(t),r∞(t),A0,A∞, we find that B(z,t) is meromorphic on [formula] and has its poles in [formula] that are equal to [formula]. The assumption we have made on r0(t)A0 implies that, [formula]. Similarly, [formula]. We remind that for all t∈U, [formula]. Hence, we find that, for all t∈U, the matrix B is meromorphic at z  =  0 (resp. the matrix B is meromorphic at z =   ∞  ), since

[formula]

Therefore, [formula]. The relation ([\ref=eq3]) follows from

[formula]

Behaviour of the Birkhoff connection matrix when q goes to 1

In this section, we see q as a parameter. We are going to make the matrix A(z,t) of § depends upon q and see what is the behaviour of the Birkhoff connection matrix when q goes to 1. First of all, let us fix [formula] with |q0| > 1. Inspiriting from the ideas of Sauloy in [\cite=S00], we are going to put q: = qε0 with [formula] and make ε goes to 0+. For R a ring, let [formula] be the ring of ν  ×  ν matrices with coefficients in R. Formally [formula], converges to the derivation [formula] when q goes to 1. Then, it is natural to consider

[formula]

Here, t belongs to [formula], that is an open connected set which is for all ε > 0 stable under σqε0. Let us assume that:

For all t∈U, for all ε > 0 sufficiently close to 0, the matrix A has no poles at 0 and ∞  . Let us also assume that A0(ε): = A(0,t,ε), (resp. A∞(ε): = A(  ∞  ,t,ε)) does not depend upon t and its Jordan normal form depends continuously upon ε. Assume the existence of complex invertible matrices Q0(ε),Q∞(ε) with entries that are continuous in ε, such that for all [formula] close to 0, the matrices Q0(ε)A0(ε)Q0(ε)- 1 and Q∞(ε)A∞(ε)Q∞(ε)- 1 are in Jordan normal form.

Each poles of z  ↦  A(z,t,ε) is proportional to t or does not depend upon t. Let [formula] be the poles of A(z,t,ε). Let us also assume that [formula] converge to [formula] when ε   →   0 + .

For every t∈U, for every compact subset of [formula], we have the uniform convergence of A(z,t,ε) to [formula] when ε  →  0+.

For all t∈U, the differential system [formula] is Fuchsian on [formula] and has exponents at 0 and ∞   which are non resonant, which means that the eigenvalues of [formula] (resp. [formula]) do not differ by a non zero integer.

For all t∈U, the complex numbers

[formula]

are distinct modulo [formula].

Note that after choosing another complex number q0 with |q0| > 1, and taking another open connected set U, we always may reduce to the case where the last assumption is satisfied. Remark also that for every ε sufficiently close to 0, ([\ref=eq4]) satisfies the same assumptions as ([\ref=eq2]) in §. Let

[formula]

[formula]

be the solutions of ([\ref=eq4]) defined in §. We would like to study the behaviour of the two solutions when ε  →  0+. For [formula], we are going to write zA instead of eA log (z). In this situation, the work of Sauloy, see [\cite=S00], §3, may be applied and we find:

Let

[formula]

[formula]

which are the solutions obtained via the Frobenius algorithm of

[formula]

It follows that P(z,t,ε) converges uniformly to [formula] in every compact subset of

[formula]

when ε  →  0+. Moreover, the matrix [formula] is locally constant, since it is meromorphic and satisfies [formula].

Let [formula]. We remind that for all t∈U, the complex numbers [formula] are distinct modulo [formula]. Let φ be the bijection of [formula], such that φ(0) = 0, φ(m + 1) = m + 1, and for all t∈U, a positive circle around z = 0 starting at z =  - 1 intersect the spirals [formula] in this order. For [formula], let [formula] be the open connected subset of [formula] with border [formula]. Note that the connected component of the domain of definition of [formula] are the [formula] with [formula]. Let [formula] be the value of [formula] in [formula].

Application to the q-analogue of the sixth Painlev� equation

We begin this section, by reminding the work of Jimbo and Sakai, see [\cite=JS], in the framework of meromorphic functions on [formula], rather than multivalued functions. Let us consider the 2  ×  2 linear differential system that is relevant for the sixth Painlev� equation:

[formula]

Here, t denotes a parameter that belongs to U, an open connected subset of [formula], and A0,A1,At are 2  ×  2 complex matrices. Let us fix q a complex number with |q| > 1, assume that U is stable under σq. Let p = 1 / q and σp: = σ- 1q. Following [\cite=JS], we consider the linear q-difference system,

[formula]

Moreover, let us assume that:

A0(t) is diagonalizable and has eigenvalues, counted with multiplicity, tθ1 and tθ2. Therefore, there exists [formula], such that A0(t) = tB0.

For all t∈U, A1(t) is a complex 2  ×  2 matrix.

[formula].

For all t∈U, tθ1,tθ2, (resp. 1 + (p - 1)κ1,1 + (p - 1)κ2) are equal or are distinct modulo [formula].

There exist [formula] such that

[formula]

Note that for p sufficiently close to 1, ([\ref=eq6]) satisfies the same assumptions as ([\ref=eq2]) in § and we may apply Proposition [\ref=propo1]. Therefore, the Birkhoff connection matrix is pseudo constant if and only if we have the existence of a convenient matrix [formula] that satisfies properties described in Proposition [\ref=propo1]. Moreover, B(z,t) has only simple poles that are equal to ta1,ta2 if a1  ≠  a2, (resp. B(z,t) has only a double pole that is equal to ta1 if a1  =  a2) and we have

[formula]

The latter system leads Jimbo and Sakai to the definition of the q-analogue of the sixth Painlev� equation.

As in § we would like to make ([\ref=eq6]) depends upon q and see what is the behaviour of the Birkhoff connection matrix when q goes to 1. Unfortunately, ([\ref=eq6]) does not degenerate very well when q goes to 1, due to the factor (z - 1)(z - t). Therefore, we are going to solve the factor (z - 1)(z - t) separately. As in §, let us fix a complex number q0 with |q0| > 1. Put q: = qε0 and let us make [formula] goes to 0+ in the equation

[formula]

Assume that [formula] has exponents at 0 and ∞   which are non resonant. Moreover, let us assume that for all t∈U, - 1,1,t, are distinct modulo [formula], and U is stable under σqε0 for every [formula]. Note that for ε sufficiently close to 0, ([\ref=eq7]) satisfies the assumptions of ([\ref=eq4]) in §. Let

[formula]

[formula]

with [formula], [formula] and [formula] be the solutions of ([\ref=eq7]) defined in §. Let [formula], be the solutions of [formula] defined in §. Let P(z,t,ε)  =  Y ∞ (z,t,ε) -  1Y0(z,t,ε), be the Birkhoff connection matrix of ([\ref=eq7]). Due to Proposition [\ref=propo2], for all t∈U, we have the uniform convergence of P(z,t,ε) to the locally constant matrix [formula] in every compact subset of

[formula]

when ε  →  0+. Moreover, Theorem [\ref=theo1] may be applied, and the values of [formula] in the connected component of its domain of definition allow us to recover the monodromy matrices at the singularities z = 1 and z = t of [formula].

Note that P is also a Birkhoff connexion matrix of

[formula]

Unfortunately, P is different to Q, the Birkhoff connexion matrix of ([\ref=eq8]), that is defined in §. To simplify the notations, from now, we are going to write q instead of qε0 and p = 1 / q instead of q-  ε0. The goal of what follows is to prove the following theorem:

Before proving the theorem, let us sate and prove a lemma.

Let [formula]. Let yα,0,yα,  ∞, be the two solutions of σpy(z) = (z - α)y(z) described in §. Then, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

First of all, note that σpy(z) = (z - α)y(z) is equivalent to [formula]. Therefore, there exist [formula], and [formula] with [formula] such that

[formula]

The function 0 is solution of [formula]. Since h0(0) = 1, we have

[formula]

Similarly, [formula] and

[formula]

We now use the Jacobi triple product formula

[formula]

to deduce that

[formula]

This completes the proof.

Let W0(z,t,ε),W∞(z,t,ε) be the solutions of ([\ref=eq8]) that are defined in §. Since ([\ref=eq8]) is equivalent to

[formula]

we find

[formula]

[formula]

with [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Using Lemma [\ref=lem1], we find

[formula]

and

[formula]

We now apply Lemma [\ref=lem1], to prove that the Birkhoff connection matrix Q(z,t,ε)  =  W -  1 ∞ (z,t,ε)W0(z,t,ε) equals to

[formula]

This proves ([\ref=eq9]). To conclude the proof of the theorem, we just have to show that the Birkhoff connection matrix Q(z,t,ε) is pseudo constant if and only if P(z,qt,ε)  =    -  P(z,t,ε)t2B0(ε). We use ([\ref=eq9]) to deduce that the Birkhoff connection matrix Q(z,t,ε) is pseudo constant if and only if

[formula]

This is equivalent P(z,qt,ε) =  - P(z,t,ε)t2B0(ε), which proves the result.

Instead of the Birkhoff connexion matrix, following [\cite=S15], one could prefer to study the behaviour of the matrix ∞(z,t,ε)- 10(z,t,ε). Applying Proposition [\ref=propo2], we find that for all t∈U, there exist [formula], [formula], with [formula] such that Ĥ∞(z,t,ε)- 1Ĥ0(z,t,ε) converges uniformly to [formula] in every compact subset of [formula] when ε  →  0+. Moreover as we can see in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem1], we obtain that

[formula]
