On the identifiability of binary Segre products

{ Abstract. We prove that a product of m > 5 copies of [formula], embedded in the projective space [formula] by the standard Segre embedding, is k-identifiable (i.e. a general point of the secant variety Sk(X) is contained in only one (k + 1)-secant k-space), for all k such that k + 1  ≤  2m - 1 / m.

Introduction

In this paper, we study secant varieties Sk of Segre products of projective spaces, with special focus on products of many copies of [formula] (binary Segre products or Bernoulli models, in Algebraic Statistics). We are mainly concerned with the number of secant spaces passing through a general point of a secant variety.

In the literature, one finds several methods for computing the dimension of secant varieties of products. Let us just mention the inductive method introduced by Abo, Ottaviani and Peterson in [\cite=AOP], which provides a procedure for detecting when the dimension coincides with the expected one. In the specific case of products of copies of [formula], a complete description of the dimension of secant varieties has been obtained by Catalisano, Geramita and Gimigliano in [\cite=CGG1] and [\cite=CGG2]. When the number of copies m of [formula] is bigger than 4, they prove that Sk has always the expected dimension. From our point of view, the result implies that, when the secant variety Sk does not fill the ambient space and m > 4, then through a general point of Sk one finds only finitely many (k + 1)-secant k-spaces. In this paper, we go one step further and we ask how many secant spaces one finds through a general point of Sk. Our main result is:

Following a notation suggested by applications to Algebraic Statistics, we say that a variety X is k-identifiable when through a general point of the secant variety Sk(X), there is only one (k + 1)-secant k-space. (Those who would prefer "generically k-identifiable" here, should consider that there are always points of Sk(X), e.g. points of X, for which the number jumps to infinity.) With this notation, our result can be rephrased by saying that a product of m > 5 copies of [formula] is k-identifiable, as soon as k + 1  ≤  2m - 1 / m (i.e. m  -   log 2(m)  ≥  ⌈ log 2(k + 1)⌉ + 1).

From this last point of view, k-identifiability has been studied because of its application to Algebraic Statistics and other fields. Using methods of Algebraic Geometry, Elmore, Hall and Neeman proved in [\cite=EHN] the following asymptotic result: when the number m of copies of [formula] is "very large" with respect to k, then the binary Segre product is k-identifiable.

As far as we know, the best bound for identifiability of binary products has been obtained by Allman, Matias and Rhodes in [\cite=AMR] (Corollary 5). They prove that the product is k-identifiable when m > 2⌈ log 2(k + 1)⌉ + 1. Thus, they give a lower bound for 2m which is quadratic with respect to k + 1. Our theorem provides an extension of these results. In order to compare with the aforementioned bounds, notice that [formula] cannot be k-identifiable for k > 2m / (m + 1) - 1, by a simple dimensional count, explained in Section [\ref=background]. Thus, the maximal k for which identifiability makes sense is kmax  =  ⌊2m / (m + 1)⌋ - 1. The result of Allman, Matias and Rhodes, rewritten from this point of view, says that [formula] is k-identifiable for k + 1  ≤  2(m - 1) / 2. Our theorem extends this bound, for we prove that:

[formula]

Still more or less half way from the maximum, but a sensible improvement, anyway. For example, for m = 10, kmax is 92, our bound proves the k-identifiability for k  ≤  50, while Allman, Matias and Rhodes give identifiability for [formula].

Our method is strongly based on the result on the dimension of secant varieties, contained in [\cite=CGG2]. Indeed, for a variety X, both the dimension of secant varieties and the number of secant spaces passing through a point, are linked to the existence of very degenerate subvarieties passing through k + 1 general points of X. We explain this fact in details, through the next section. Using this remark, transferring results on the dimension of secant varieties to results on the identifiability, becomes straightforward. At the end of the paper, we will explain why we need the assumption m > 5. Namely, we prove that [formula] is not 4-identifiable.

Let us finish by stating the following conjecture, suggested by our analysis.

Geometric background

In this section, we collect some known results on secant varieties and Segre products. We refer to [\cite=CC2], for details and proofs. We work over the complex field and we consider the projective space [formula], equipped with the tautological line bundle [formula].

If Y is a subset of [formula], we denote by 〈Y〉 the linear span of Y. We say that Y is non-degenerate if [formula]. A linear subspace of dimension n of [formula] will be called a n-subspace of [formula].

Let [formula] be an irreducible, projective, non-degenerate variety of dimension m. For any non-negative integer k, the k-secant variety of X is the Zariski closure in [formula] of the union of all k-dimensional subspaces of [formula] that are spanned by k + 1 independent points of X. We denote it by Sk(X), or Sk, if no confusion arises. Sk(X) can be seen as the closure of the image, under the second projection, of the abstract secant variety, i.e. the incidence subvariety [formula],

[formula]

Notice that AbSk(X) is always a variety of dimension mk + m + k. When [formula] is reducible, the same definition of secant variety holds, except that we only consider linear spaces meeting every component of X. In particular, when X has k + 1 components, the secant variety coincides with the join of the components (see [\cite=Zak]).

We say that X has k-th secant order μ if for a general point P∈Sk(X), there are exactly μ unordered (k + 1)-uples [formula] of points of X such that [formula]. We say that X is (generically) k-identifiable if it has k-th secant order 1, i.e. if for a general point P∈Sk(X), there is a unique unordered (k + 1)-uple [formula] of points of X such that [formula].

From the definition of secant varieties, it follows that:

[formula]

The right hand side is called the expected dimension of Sk(X).

We say that X is k-defective when a strict inequality holds in ([\ref=defect]).

Let [formula] be a variety. We denote by Sing(X) the Zariski-closed subset of singular points of X. Let [formula] be a smooth point. We denote by TX,P the embedded tangent space to X at P, which is a m-subspace of [formula]. More generally, if [formula] are smooth points of X, we will set

[formula]

The relations between secant varieties and tangent spaces to X are enlightened by the celebrated Terracini's Lemma:

Using the correspondence between the abstract secant variety and Sk(X), one obtains from Terracini's Lemma, a condition for the defectivity of X:

The previous Theorem suggests a refinement of the notion of defective variety.

An irreducible, non-degenerate variety [formula] such that s(k)(X) < r is k-weakly defective if for P0,...,Pk∈X general points, the general hyperplane H containing TX,P0,...,Pk is tangent to X along a variety Σ(H) of positive dimension. Σ(H) is called the (k + 1)-contact variety of H.

It turns out that k-defective implies k-weakly defective, but the converse is false. We refer to [\cite=CC0] and [\cite=CC2] for a discussion on the subject.

The main link between identifiability and weakly defective varieties lies in the following:

Thus, a way to prove that a variety X is k-identifiable, at least when r  ≠  mk + m + k, is to prove that X is not k-weakly defective, or, if it is k-weakly defective, that the general contact variety Σ has k-th secant order 1.

The second cornerstone in our theory links k-defectivity and k-weakly defectivity with the existence of degenerate subvarieties, passing through k + 1 general points in X. Namely, if X is k-defective or k-weakly defective, then it turns out that the general contact variety is highly degenerate.

In conclusion, we obtain:

This is our starting point. In the next sections, we will obtain the k-identifiability of products of [formula]'s, for k in our range, by proving that subvarieties of Segre products [formula] passing through k + 1 general points cannot be too degenerate, unless they are formed by a bunch of independent linear spaces. One should observe that both Corollary [\ref=basic] and the second part of Theorem [\ref=mu1] cannot be inverted.

As a consequence, one cannot use the inverse of the previous argument to determine the non-identifiability of a variety X, simply by studying degenerate subvarieties.

Proof of the Theorem

Let us start with an useful Lemma of Linear Algebra:

We may assume that H0 meets the span [formula]. If d =  dim (H0) and e =  dim (L), then by assumption [formula] has dimension at most d + e, while for a general choice of the points P0, P1,

[formula]

for the two spaces belong to linearly independent copies of [formula] in the product. Now, the claim follows by specializing all [formula] to P1.

The proof of our Main Theorem now follows soon by the main result of [\cite=CGG2] and by the following general observation.

If X is k-weakly defective, then by Theorem [\ref=wdef] the (k + 1)-contact locus is a subvariety W of some dimension n > 0, contained in [formula], which passes through k + 1 general points of X. Assume that such a variety exists. Call W'  ⊂  Y the image of W in the projection X  →  Y and call n' =  dim (W'). Since W' passes through k + 1 general points of Y, and Y is not k-defective, then the span of W' has dimension at least n'k + n' + k, by the second part of Theorem [\ref=wdef]. Now, notice that the fibers of the projection W  →  W' span a space of dimension at least n - n' in [formula]. It follows, by Linear Algebra, that W spans a space of dimension at least (n - n' + 1)(n'k + n' + k).

Now, we have to study several cases. Assume 0 < n' < n. Then n'(n - n')  ≥  n - n', so that (n - n' + 1)n'  ≥  n. Moreover (n - n' + 1)k > k. It follows that (n - n' + 1)(n'k + n' + k) is bigger than nk + n + k, so we get a contradiction.

Assume n = n' > 0. By construction, the linear series L which sends W to [formula], passing through the embedding W  ⊂  X and the projection X  →  Y, has dimension equal to the span of W'. Hence it has dimension kn + n + k, in our case. Call L' the linear series defining the projection [formula]. If the image of W in [formula] has dimension at least 1, then the embedding of W in [formula] is given by a series L + L', whose dimension is at least dim (L) + 1 = nk + n + k + 1. It follows that W spans a space of dimension at least nk + n + k + 1, a contradiction. Since W passes through k + 1  ≥  2 points of X, its image into [formula] can be trivial only when W is given by k + 1 components, [formula] and each Wi is contained in a fiber of the projection [formula]. By monodromy (Remark [\ref=monod]), each Wi has the same dimension n and spans a space of the same dimension q', in the fiber. Call [formula] the projections of these spaces to [formula]. Since W' spans a space of dimension nk + n + k, then the Hi's span a space of the same dimension. Thus, if the Hi's are not linearly independent, then W spans a space of dimension at least nk + n + k + 1, by Lemma [\ref=linalg], a contradiction. It follows that the span of the Hi's has dimension nk + n + k = q'k + q' + k, so that q' = n. This means that each Wi projects to a subspace Hi of dimension n in [formula]. Since each Wi sits in a fiber of [formula], this implies that each Wi is linear, and these subspaces are independent.

Assume n' = 0. Then necessarily W consists of k + 1 components [formula], each Wi being contained in a fiber of the projection. As above, it turns out that W spans a space of dimension kq' + q' + k. Thus q' > n yields a contradiction. Hence q' = n, so that every Wi is linear.

It follows, from the previous analysis, that necessarily W is the union of k + 1 linearly independent subspaces of dimension n. We get then that either X is not k-defective, so it is k-identifiable by Theorem [\ref=basic], or it is k-defective, and the (k + 1)-contact variety W is the union of k + 1 linearly independent subspaces of dimension n. In the latter case, the k-th secant order of W is known to be 1 (see Example [\ref=linsp]). Thus X is k-identifiable, by Theorem [\ref=mu2].

Proof of the main Theorem Let k the any positive integer such that (k + 1)m < 2m - 1 - 1, so that the k - secant variety of [formula] cannot span [formula]. By the main result of [\cite=CGG2], [formula] is not k - defective. Then the previous Lemma implies that [formula] is k-identifiable. Indeed, the previous Lemma also prove the following, stronger statement:

We know from the proof of the previous Lemma, that if X is k-weakly defective, then a general hyperplane H tangent at k + 1 general points [formula] of X, is tangent along a union of linear spaces. Thus it can only be tangent along fibers of some projection [formula], because the product does not contain other lines. This is clear for [formula], while for higher dimensional products one can argue by induction, on some projection [formula]. Thus, by symmetry, X can be k-weakly defective only when a general (k + 1)-tangent hyperplane H is tangent along all the fibers passing through [formula]. But then, for a general choice of a point Q in some fiber passing through P0, a general hyperplane tangent to [formula] is also tangent at [formula]. By the same argument, it is also tangent along any fiber passing through Q. Arguing again in this way, we get that a general H must be tangent (thus must contain) any point of X. An obvious contradiction.

Results for small m

Indeed, we prove that through 5 general points of X one can find an irreducible elliptic normal curve [formula], contained in X. Since a general point of the [formula], spanned by C, sits in exactly two subspaces of dimension 4, 5-secant to an irreducible elliptic normal curve (by [\cite=CC2] Proposition 5.2), it follows that the 4-th secant order of X is at least 2. In particular, X is 4-weakly defective, by [\cite=CC2], proposition 2.7, and the 4-th contact locus contains an elliptic normal curve as C. A computer aided computation, at 5 specific points of X, proves that indeed the 5-contact locus of X is exactly an irreducible elliptic normal curve of degree 12. The computation has been performed with the Macaulay2 Computer Algebra package [\cite=GS], with the script described in [\cite=BC]. Thus 4-th secant order of X is 2 (by Theorem [\ref=mu2]) and the claim is proved.

To prove the existence of the curve C passing through 5 general points [formula] of X, we start with the product of three lines [formula]. Through the 5 points [formula], projection of the Pi's, one can find a 2-dimensional family F of elliptic normal curves C' of degree 6. Indeed [formula] is a sestic threefold with elliptic curve sections, and there is a 2-dimensional family of hyperplanes passing through 5 general points of X. F is parametrized by points of some plane Π, obtained by projecting [formula] from the span of the P'i's.

Consider now the product X'' of the two remaining copies of [formula], so that X = X'  ×  X''. We also get 5 distinguished general points [formula]. For any curve C' of the family F, we have a 7-dimensional family of embeddings C'  →  X''. Thus, adding the automorphisms of C', for C'∈F general, we may assume that each P'i, [formula], goes to the corresponding P''i. The condition that P'0 goes to P''0 determines two algebraic condition on the family, hence two algebraic curves on Π. Thus, there is at least one curve C' of the family, for which P'0 goes to P''0. This determines an elliptic normal curve C in X, passing through the 5 given general points Pi's. The fact that C is irreducible, for a general choice of the points, follows by the computer-aided computation, on a specific example.

For 6 copies of [formula], the maximal value for which k-identifiability makes sense is kmax = 9. Our result gives that the product X of 6 copies of [formula] is k-identifiable, for [formula]. The k-identifiability of [formula], for k = 6,7,8,9, can be directly checked by a computer-aided procedure. Indeed, the following observation reduces our problem to check only what happens for the maximal number k such that mk + m + k < r.

Fix k + 1 general points [formula]. The family of hyperplanes containing the tangent space [formula] is irreducible, so a general hyperplane tangent to X at [formula] is the limit of a family of hyperplanes tangent at [formula]. Since the general element of this last family has a zero dimensional contact locus, the claim follows.

Now, by Corollary [\ref=basic], it is enough to compute that some hyperplane tangent to X at some points [formula], is in fact tangent only at those k + 1 points. Using this procedure with 9 points of [formula], a computer-aided compution, using the script in [\cite=BC], proves the following:

For sure, with a more advanced technical equipment, one can analyze products with more copies of [formula]. Nevertheless, Proposition [\ref=sei] already provides an initial evidence for our Conjecture [\ref=conge].
