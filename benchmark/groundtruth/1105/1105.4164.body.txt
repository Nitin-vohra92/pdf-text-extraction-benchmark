Dynamical Decoupling in Optical Fibers: Preserving Polarization Qubits from Birefringent Dephasing

Qubits are the building blocks for quantum information processing. They are used to store, process and transmit information. Unavoidable couplings between the qubit and its environment introduce uncontrolled evolution of the qubits causing the qubit to lose its ability to exhibit coherent behaviour. As a result, the phase of the qubit becomes randomized and the information stored in it is lost. Such decoherence processes stand as a serious obstacle towards achieving scalable quantum information processing. In fact, one has to address and minimize the decoherence effects in all the applications depending crucially on the capability of maintaining and exploiting quantum coherence. Dynamical decoupling (DD) is a simple and effective technique that can be used to extend the lifetime of the stationary qubit. The idea of decoupling the qubit from the interaction with the environment is inspired by the idea of the coherent averaging by applying external pulse sequences. For the last few decades, intensive theoretical and experimental efforts have been performed to extend the idea of refocussing the phase diffusion through the application of such repeated external pulses to a wide variety of DD strategies. Prominent examples of DD schemes are the periodic DD (PDD) [\cite=Viola], Carr-Purcell DD (CP) [\cite=CP], Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) [\cite=CPMG], concatenated DD (CDD) [\cite=Lidar] and Uhrig DD (UDD) [\cite=Uhrig]. Recent developments in the above schemes of DD has motivated us to study if we can obtain the optimal DD strategy to preserve polarization qubits against decoherence effects. Wu and Lidar [\cite=Wu] analytically showed that parity-kick version of the 'bang-bang' decoupling [\cite=BB] could be used for particular types of noise models in optical fibers. However, the CPMG sequence [\cite=CPMG] has recently been shown to be very robust against a variety of dephasing and rotation errors [\cite=Cywinski] [\cite=Ajoy].

We propose a brand new application of the CPMG sequence of the dynamical decoupling for optimally minimizing the random dephasing in birefringent optical fibers. We apply this sequence to flying qubits (instead of the stationary qubits)--polarization states of light in optical fibers, in order to extend useful range of quantum communication channels. In particular, we implement the CPMG pulses with spatially seperated half-wave plates to suppress the dephasing of the input polarization qubits used in the BB84 protocol [\cite=BB84] of the quantum key distribution, along with possible applications in the emerging fields like optical quantum computing [\cite=Kok], quantum cryptography [\cite=Ekert], quantum teleportation [\cite=Dowling], etc.

In the BB84 protocol, it is crucial to preserve the input polarized signals against decoherence effects during propagation through the noisy communication channel between Alice and Bob. Polarization-maintaining (PM) fibers can be used to preserve two orthogonal states of single photon polarization qubit, e.g. photon states with vertical and horizontal polarizations [\cite=VanWiggeren] [\cite=Rashleigh]. However, Alice needs to randomly choose the input polarized light signals either from the horizontal-vertical basis or the diagonal basis. Therefore, it is necessary to preserve all of these states against unpredictable changes in the polarization state due to dephasing in the fiber [\cite=Shor].

In ordinary single mode fibers, the polarization state of input light changes very rapidly even for a small distance due to the random fluctuations in the uncontrollable factors like mechanical stress (internal or external) [\cite=Ulrich], temperature, etc. These effects cause the birefringence [formula] (e and o stand for the extraordinary and the ordinary rays) to change randomly along the fiber. In the following, we propose the application of dynamical decoupling to combat the random dephasing in such birefringent fiber.

Let us first consider how the waveplates implementing π-pulses inside the fibers affect the propagation of the qubit in the most general case of a multi-pulse sequence. In order to suppress a pure dephasing (T1  ≫  T2), we apply a pulse sequence consisting of N instantaneous π-pulses at the points x1,x2,..,xN inside the fiber of length L. The π-pulses cause the qubit state to rotate about the x axis. Since this π rotation about the x axis is given by [formula], the propagation of the input qubit state after the application of the pulse sequence can be written as

[formula]

apart from some constant multiplicative factors in the exponentials. Here S is the spatial analogue of the time-ordering operator.

Following a similar argument in Ref. [\cite=Cywinski], we write the decoherence function for the dephasing in the fiber (without pulses)

[formula]

where S(k) is the power spectrum, i.e. the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function for the random spatial fluctuation of the birefringence.

Upon application of a DD pulse sequence with the filter function F(kL) in the space domain, the decoherence function can then, following [\cite=Cywinski] be shown to be

[formula]

where the filter function F(kL) is given by [formula], corresponding to a pulse sequence having specific set of xm with x0=0 and xn + 1 = L.

Eq. [\eqref=eq3], upon comparison to Eq. [\eqref=eq2], shows that by choosing suitable F(kL) and hence DD pulse-sequence, one can expect to reduce decoherence effects introduced by the preceding free propagation of the qubit. This has also been shown analytically for a general two-state quantum system in Ref. [\cite=ViolaLloyd].

We consider a quantum communication channel provided by a polarization maintaining fiber without dispersion. Assuming that the single photon sources are available, we initialize the qubit in the [formula] or [formula] states as the input qubit which can be written as [formula].

If we now allow the input photons to propagate freely (and therefore to gather dephasing [formula]) for a length [formula], then the qubit state becomes [formula]. The phase accumulated by the qubit is given by [formula] (We consider λ to be in the fiber-optic telecommunication band).

For randomly generated lengths [formula]L and corresponding change in the refractive index difference [formula], an integration for a length L gives the total random phase difference as [formula]. We model the random dephasing by continuously concatenating pieces of fiber with randomly generated lengths [formula] and corresponding change in the refractive index difference [formula]. Propagation over total distance L and ensemble averaging over randomly generated segments of optical fibers results in dephasing of the qubit if it is in a superposition state.

The accumulated phase can be rewritten as [formula]. The two terms in the square brackets are dimensionless. We thus simulated the dephasing model in a dimensionless manner such that propagation of the input qubit through any given length of the fiber can be simulated just by adjusting the parameters of the randomly generated [formula]. For example, for a given fiber length of 1 km, one can choose the parameters (mean and standard deviation) of [formula] in the km range to simulate the dephasing along the fiber.

In order to preserve the input polarization qubits in polarization maintaining optical fiber, we implement the CPMG sequence by spatially separated half-wave plates along the fiber. The multi-pulse CPMG sequence is defined by [formula] [\cite=CPMG] [\cite=Cywinski] where we take the number of waveplates in one cycle N = 4 obbserving that with such sequence the input state remains very well-preserved after propagation through any given length of the fiber.

Each cycle of the four pulse CPMG is implemented in the following steps (as shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig1]): single photon qubit polarized in the [formula] or [formula] state is fed into the channel we modelled above; allow the input qubits to propagate through a segment of the fiber for a length of Lτ; implement the first π-pulse of the CPMG sequence with half-wave plates in the diagonal basis; allow a free propagation as before but this time for the length 2Lτ; second and third π-pulses are then implemented by the same type of waveplates each followed by free propagation of length 2Lτ; finally, the fourth pulse is implemented followed by a free propagation of length Lτ.

At the end of one cycle of the sequence (having length 8Lτ), the state of the qubit-fiber system is [formula] where the propagator Û(x = 0; ~ x = 8Lτ) is given by Û  =  Û1(Lτ)σ̂xÛ2(2Lτ)σ̂xÛ3(2Lτ)σ̂xÛ4(2Lτ)σ̂xÛ5(Lτ). Here σ̂x is the Pauli X operator and [formula] is the propagator corresponding to the free propagation through the i-th segment.

The CPMG sequence having 4N pulses is thus obtained by repeating the above cycle N times and the propagator for such sequence is [formula] where Û is defned above.

For the CPMG sequence with N=4 pulses, the filter function is given by F(kL) ~  =  ~ 8 sin 4(kL / 16) sin 2(kL / 2) /  cos 2(kL / 4) [\cite=Cywinski]. The decoherence functions W(x) without CPMG and with CPMG are plotted in Fig. 2 for a small distance along the fiber. We can theoretically predict that CPMG should preserve the coherence of the input polarized qubit for a longer length than the fiber without the waveplates.

To characterize the effectiveness of our scheme, we use the fidelity F between the input state |ψin〉 and ρout as F = |〈ψin|ρout|ψin〉|, where [formula] [formula]. Here n is the total number of randomly generated phase profiles and |ψi〉  =  ûi|ψin〉;ûi is the propagation operator for the i-th profile. Thus, the fidelity being close to one implies that the the input state is well-preserved against the dephasing.

We observed that the fidelity drastically improves (compared to the without CPMG case) when we used the waveplates even for a large variation of the parameters of the random dephasing and this is shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig3]. In Fig. [\ref=Fig4], the contour plot of the fidelity is shown with respect to the standard deviations [formula] and [formula]. This plot shows that high fidelity can be obtained with the proper choice of the above parameters.

The variation of fidelity for different fiber lengths is plotted in Fig. [\ref=Fig5] which shows that polarization qubits could be preserved upto an excellent fidelity using the CPMG sequence for a wide range of the total fiber length. Moreover, for a given length of the fiber (e.g. 1 km), we could estimate the minimum number of waveplates required to achieve high fidelity (close to one) and this can be seen in Fig. [\ref=Fig6].

Our dimensionless scheme allows us to tackle the random dephasing using the four-pulse CPMG sequence for any experimentally viable length of the fiber. However, to experimentally implement (i.e. inserting the half-wave plates along the fiber without incorporating much loss) our proposed method to preserve the polarization qubits, several familiar techniques could be suggested depending on the range of fiber lengths one wishes to use. These include writing the Bragg transmission grating periodically into the fiber [\cite=Scalora], periodically doping the fiber with off-resonant rare earth ions [\cite=Eldada] or twisting the fiber in controlled ways causing suitable mechanical stress [\cite=Ulrich].

In this letter, we demonstrated in a very unique way that the CPMG sequence implemented by suitably embedded half-wave plates can be used to preserve the input polarization states against random dephasing in non-dispersive optical fibers. We report for the first time the successful application of the CPMG dynamical decoupling in the optical fiber which evidently will enhance the range and scope of useful communication through the optical fiber and possibly the coherence time of the qubit. The control overhead in the proposed application of CPMG being small, we are hopeful that our scheme will reduce the dephasing error while implementing a scalable quantum computing scheme with photonic qubits.
