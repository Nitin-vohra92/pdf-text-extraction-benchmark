The linear trace Harnack quadratic on a steady gradient Ricci soliton satisfies the heat equation

All quantities shall be assumed C∞.

1. Evolution of the linear trace Harnack on steady and shrinking gradient Ricci solitons

Suppose [formula] satisfies the linearized Ricci flow [formula] and [formula], where ΔL denotes the Lichnerowicz Laplacian.Addresses. Bennett Chow: Math. Dept., UC San Diego; Peng Lu: Math. Dept., U of Oregon. Define the matrix Harnack quantities (see Hamilton [\cite=H2])

[formula]

Recall that if [formula] is any time-dependent vector field on M, then the corresponding linear trace Harnack quantity [formula] satisfies (see [\cite=CH])

[formula]

Since [formula], we may take [formula]. Then [formula], which is Hamilton's trace Harnack quadratic. Furthermore, if [formula], then [formula] by [formula] and [formula].

Now consider the linear trace Harnack quantity for the linearized Ricci flow on a steady gradient Ricci soliton.

If [formula] satisfies [formula], [formula], [formula], then [formula] satisfies [formula]. I.e., the linear trace Harnack quantity solves the heat equation.

By [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula], for [formula] each of the terms on the rhs of ([\ref=Z_evolution_for_X]) (with [formula]) are zero.

Remark. (1) The quantity [formula] arises naturally from the following consideration. If [formula] are such that [formula] and [formula], where H = gijhij (so that [formula]; see [\cite=Per1]), then Perelman's scalar curvature satisfies

[formula]

Note for a steady gradient Ricci soliton, [formula] while [formula].

(2) If [formula] solves [formula] and [formula], then [formula] satisfies [formula], where [formula] (see [\cite=Per1]).

The shrinker analogue of Lemma [\ref=Lemon_1] is the following.

If [formula], t < 0, satisfies [formula], [formula], and [formula], then [formula].

Applying [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula] to ([\ref=Z_evolution_for_X]) yields [formula]. Because [formula], we conclude

[formula]

Remark. If [formula], then for a shrinker, since [formula] and H = R, we have that [formula].

2. Interpolating between Perelman's and Cao-Hamilton's Harnacks on a steady soliton

Now consider the system [formula], [formula], and [formula], u > 0 (when n = 2 this is the linearized Ricci flow). Mimicking Li, Yau, and Hamilton, define v =  log u, Q = Δv + R, and [formula]. Then

[formula]

Following X. Cao and Hamilton [\cite=XCaoHamilton], define the Harnack [formula]. Since

[formula]

we have that [formula] satisfies the parabolic Bochner-type formula

[formula]

In particular, if [formula], then [formula].

More generally, if [formula] (interpolating), where [formula], then [formula] satisfies the heat equation

[formula]

where [formula]. The Ricci terms may also be rewritten as [formula]. If ε =  - 1, we have

[formula]

This is a special case of Perelman's pointwise energy monotonicity formula. We interpolated the calculations but not the estimates between ε- 1 =  - 1 and ε- 1 = 1; for successful interpolations between Li-Yau-Hamilton inequalities, see Ni [\cite=Ni1], [\cite=Ni05].
