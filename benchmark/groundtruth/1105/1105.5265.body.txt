The effect of metallicity on the delay-time distribution of type Ia supernova

Introduction

Although Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are very important in cosmology ([\cite=RIE98]; [\cite=PER99]), the exact nature of their progenitors is still unclear ([\cite=HN00]; [\cite=LEI00]; [\cite=PAR07]). There is a consensus that SNe Ia result from the thermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD) in a binary system ([\cite=HF60]). According to the nature of the companions of the mass accreting WDs, two basic scenarios for the progenitors of SN Ia have been discussed over the last three decades. One is the single degenerate (SD) model ([\cite=WI73]; [\cite=NTY84]), i.e. the companion is a main-sequence or a slightly evolved star (WD+MS), or a red giant star (WD+RG) or a helium star (WD + He star) ([\cite=LI97]; [\cite=HAC99a]; [\cite=LAN00]; [\cite=HAN04]; [\cite=CHENWC07]; [\cite=MENG09]; [\cite=LGL09]; [\cite=WANGB09a]; [\cite=WANGB10]). The other is the double degenerate (DD) model, i.e. the companion is another WD ([\cite=IT84]; [\cite=WEB84]). Measuring the delay-time distribution (DTD, delay time is the elapsed time between primordial system formation and explosion as a SN Ia event) is a very important way to distinguish between the different progenitor systems. Recently, using the high-redshift SNe Ia sample (0.2 < z < 1.8) from the Hubble Space Telescope ACS imaging of the GOODS North and South fields, [\citet=STROLGER10] showed a significantly delayed DTD that is confined to 3-4 Gyr, which is difficult to resolve with any intrinsic DTD. This result confirmed their previous findings ([\cite=STROLGER04]). But, they also noticed that this result is mainly motivated by the decline in the number of SNe Ia at z > 1.2. Their sub-samples with low redshift (z < 1.2) showed plausible DTDs dominated by SNe Ia with short delay times. The difference between their low-z and high-z results may be partly explained by the fact that a substantial fraction of z > 1.2 supernova may be obscured by dust. However, the DTD derived by [\citet=STROLGER10] may be dominated by systematic errors, in particular due to uncertainties in the star formation history (SFH, [\cite=FORSTER06]). The inferred delay time is strongly dependent on the peak in the assumed SFH and none of the popular progenitor models under consideration can be ruled out with any significant degree of confidence (see also [\cite=ODA08] and [\cite=VALIANTE09]).

Moreover, the results of [\citet=STROLGER10] are inconsistent with many low and moderate redshift measurements, which showed that most SNe Ia have delay times between 0.3 and 2 Gyr ([\cite=SCHAWINSKI09]), and there are also SNe Ia with very long delay times (older than 10 Gyr inferred from SNe Ia in elliptical galaxies in the local universe, [\cite=MAN05]) or extremely short delay times (shorter than 0.1-0.3 Gyr, [\cite=MAN06]; [\cite=SCHAWINSKI09]; [\cite=RASKIN09]). Based on some observations, i.e. the strong enhancement of the SN Ia birthrate in radio-loud early-type galaxies, the strong dependence of the SN Ia birthrate on the colors of the host galaxies, and the evolution of the SN Ia birthrate with redshift ([\cite=DEL05]; [\cite=MAN05]; [\cite=STROLGER04]), [\citet=MAN06] suggested a bimodal DTD, in which some of the SNe Ia explode soon after starburst with a delay time less than 0.1-0.5 Gyr ('prompt' SNe Ia, [\cite=SCHAWINSKI09]; [\cite=RASKIN09]), while the rest have a much wider distribution with a delay time of about 3 Gyr ('tardy' SNe Ia). In theory, the bimodal DTD may be constructed from detailed binary population synthesis ([\cite=MENGYANG10a]). However, the excess of SNe Ia in radio galaxies is the only one observation that strongly indicates an extremely large amount of the prompt population and hence is distinct from the longer delay time population (see [\cite=MAN06]), but this excess is not supported by a more recent observation ([\cite=GRAHAM10]). By comparing with host galaxy color, some authors proposed a simple two-component model, A+B model, which may be a variation of the bimodal DTD. ([\cite=SB05]; [\cite=SULLIVAN06]; [\cite=BRANDT10]). Recently, more and more observational evidence showed that the DTD of SNe Ia follows the power-law form of t - 1 which is much different from the results of [\citet=STROLGER10]. The power-law form is even different from the bimodal model or the A+B model, which might indicate that the simple two-component model is an insufficient description for observational data. ([\cite=TOTANI08]; [\cite=MAOZ10b]; [\cite=MAOZ10a] [\cite=MAOZ10]). Even via the same method as [\citet=STROLGER10], i.e. comparison between cosmic SFR evolution and SN Ia rate evolution, a t - 1 DTD was also found to be in nice agreement with observed data ([\cite=GRAUR11]). The DTD derived by [\citet=STROLGER10] is well confined to 3-4 Gyr which is strongly inconsistent with those DTDs mentioned above, and only a small fraction belong to the "prompt" SNe Ia population, i.e. smaller than 10%. However, some low-redshift samples show the existence of prompt SNe Ia at a high confidence level, and the birth rate of the prompt component is much higher than that of the tardy SNe Ia ([\cite=AUBOURG08]; [\cite=MAOZ10]). Theoretically, short delay SNe Ia may also be produced by a WD + helium star and WD + MS channel ([\cite=WANGB09a]; [\cite=MENGYANG10a]).

Whatever, [\citet=STROLGER10] suggested that the effect of metallicity could be one possible resolution for disagreement between their discovery and low/moderate results. In this paper, we want to check whether changing the metallicity can create DTDs consistent with the results of [\citet=STROLGER10], in the framework of the single-degenerate scenario.

In section [\ref=sect:2], we simply describe our method, and present the calculation results in section [\ref=sect:3]. In section [\ref=sect:4], we show discussions and our main conclusions.

METHOD

Recently, [\citet=MENGYANG10a] constructed a comprehensive single degenerate progenitor model for SNe Ia. In this model, the mass-stripping effect of optically thick wind ([\cite=HAC96]) and the effect of a thermally instable disk were included ([\cite=HKN08]; [\cite=XL09]). The prescription of [\citet=HAC99a] on WDs accreting hydrogen-rich material from their companions was applied to calculate the WD mass growth. The optically thick wind and the material stripped-off by the wind were assumed to take away the specific angular momentum of the WD and its companion, respectively. In [\citet=MENGYANG10a], both WD + MS channel and WD + RG channel are considered, i.e. Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) begins at MS or RG stage. The Galactic birth rate of SNe Ia derived from that model is comparable with that from observations. In addition, this model may even explain some supernovae with low hydrogen mass in their explosion ejecta ([\cite=MENGYANG10b]). [\citet=MENGYANG10a] calculated more than 1600 WD close binary evolutions and showed the initial parameter space leading to SNe Ia in an orbital period - secondary mass (log Pi,Mi2) plane, and these results may be conveniently used in a binary population synthesis code for obtaining the DTD of SNe Ia.

The delay time of a SN Ia from the SD model is mainly determined by the stellar evolutionary timescale of the secondary, and thus the secondary mass. That is to say that the DTD of SNe Ia is a function of the location of the parameter space in the (log Pi,Mi2) plane. However, this location is directly affected by metallicity. For a system with given initial WD mass and orbital period, the initial mass of the companion leading to SNe Ia increases with metallicity, i.e. the upper boundary and lower boundary of the companion mass move to lower values with the decrease of metallicity (see the figure 4 in [\cite=MENG09]). Thus, the DTD of SNe Ia are affected by metallicity via companion mass. Between the two boundaries of the companion mass for SNe Ia, the lower boundary dominates the longer delay time of SNe Ia. The low boundary is mainly determined by the condition that the mass transfer rate between a CO WD and its companion is higher than a critical value which is the lowest accretion rate of a CO WD avoiding violent nova explosion, while the upper boundaries are mainly determined by dynamically instable mass transfer and the strong hydrogen-shell flash. The mass transfer rate for a given binary system is closely related to metallicity, which is due to the correlation between stellar structure and metallicity ([\cite=UME99]; [\cite=CHE07]). Generally, the time-scale for mass transfer is the thermal time-scale, which increases with metallicity. This leads to a higher mass-transfer rate for a low metallicity system ([\cite=LAN00]). So, low-mass companions with low metallicity are thus more likely to fulfills the constraint for mass transfer than those with high metallicity. A WD + MS system with a low metallicity is therefor more likely to be the progenitor of a SN Ia (see also [\cite=MENG09]). On the other hand, a high mass-transfer rate means that a binary system with the same initial parameters but al low metallicity will fulfill the condition of dynamical instability more possible. Even though the mass transfer for the system is dynamically stable, the mass-transfer rate could be so high that most of the transferred material is lost from the system by the optically thick wind, and at the same time, a large amount of hydrogen-rich material stripped off by the wind is lost from the companion envelope. The mass-transfer rate then sharply decreases to less than the critical value for avoiding the strong hydrogen-shell flash after mass-ratio inversion. As a consequence, the initial parameter space for SNe Ia moves to a lower companion mass with the decrease of metallicity ([\cite=MENG09]). For example, for a system with given initial WD mass and initial orbital period, the companion mass for Z = 0.001 is lower than that of Z = 0.02 by about 0.4 [formula] (see also [\cite=CHENWC09]). In this paper, we do not calculate binary evolution for low metallicity, instead we move the parameter space for SNe Ia of Z = 0.02 given by [\citet=MENGYANG10a] to a lower companion mass by 0.4 [formula] and assume rather arbitrarily that the parameter space with a low companion mass is equivalent to that for Z = 0.001. To clarify what we did, we use the case of [formula] as an example (see figure [\ref=move]). Since we only want to check whether the metallicity has an ability to create a DTD matching with the discovery of [\citet=STROLGER10], this simple assumption is not unreasonable (see discussion in section [\ref=sect:4.3]).

To obtain the DTD of Z = 0.001, we have performed a series detailed Monte Carlo simulations via Hurley's rapid binary evolution code ([\cite=HUR00] [\cite=HUR02]). In the simulations, if a binary system evolves to a WD + MS or WD + RG stage, and the system is located in the (log Pi,Mi2) plane for SNe Ia at the onset of RLOF, we assume that a SN Ia is produced. In the simulations, we follow the evolution of 107 sample binaries. The evolutional channel is described in [\citet=MENGYANG10a]. As in [\citet=MENGYANG10a], we adopted the following input for the simulations. (1) A single starburst is assumed, i.e. [formula] in stars are produced at one time. (2) The initial mass function (IMF) of [\citet=MS79] is adopted. (3) The mass-ratio distribution is taken to be constant. (4) The distribution of separations is taken to be constant in log a for wide binaries, where a is the orbital separation. (5) A circular orbit is assumed for all binaries. (6)The common envelope (CE) ejection efficiency αCE, which denotes the fraction of the released orbital energy used to eject the CE, is set to 1.0 or 3.0. (See [\citet=MENGYANG10a] for details).

RESULT

In figure [\ref=001], we show the evolution of the birthrates of SNe Ia for a single starburst for different αCE and different metallicities. We can see from the figure that whatever the αCE, the DTDs of Z = 0.001 are significantly delayed compared with those of Z = 0.02. For Z = 0.02, SNe Ia mainly occur between 0.2 and 2 Gyr with a mean value of 0.89 Gyr after the burst, while they occur between 0.3 and 3.5 Gyr with a mean value of 1.94 Gyr for Z = 0.001. This is mainly derived from the low companion mass for low metallicity. As stated in [\citet=HAN04] and [\citet=MENGYANG10a], we found that a high αCE leads to a systematically later explosion time for Z = 0.001, because a high αCE leads to wider WD binaries, and as a consequence, it takes a longer time for the secondary to evolve to fill its Roche lobe. As noticed by [\citet=MENG09], the peak value of the DTD for low metallicity is lower than that for high metalicity and the WD + MS channel is the dominant channel for the peak value. However, the contribution of WD + RG channel to SNe Ia for Z = 0.001 is higher than that for Z = 0.02, i.e. 1%-2% for Z = 0.02, but 8.6%-16% for Z = 0.001. Actually, [\citet=MENG09] noticed that the WD + RG channel may be more common for low metallicity (see footnote 1 in [\cite=MENG09]).

We also checked the fraction of SNe Ia with short delay times and found that a substantial fraction of SNe Ia have a delay time shorter than 1 Gyr and the fraction of SNe Ia with short delay times increases with metallicity, i.e. about 35% for Z = 0.001, while more than 70% for Z = 0.02.

DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

comparison wiht observations

Measuring the DTD of SNe Ia is an important way to constrain the nature of the progenitor of SNe Ia. Recently, [\citet=STROLGER10] used data from the Hubble space telescope to confirm their previous results that the data are largely inconsistent with progenitor scenarios with short delay time, which is difficult to explain with any intrinsic DTD. [\citet=STROLGER10] suggested a possible resolution for their results, i.e environment such as metallicity may affect the progenitor mechanism efficiently, especially in the early universe. Our results in this paper seem to support this suggestion because we found that low metallicity may significantly delay the DTD of SNe Ia. If the result obtained by [\citet=STROLGER10] shows the real nature of the DTD of SNe Ia, metallicity could be an indispensable factor which must be considered when studying the progenitors of SNe Ia. However, for a high-z SNe Ia sample as used by [\citet=STROLGER10], whether metallicity works as significantly as suggested in this paper should be checked carefully since optically thick wind could not work, and thus SNe Ia could not occur in a low-metallicity environment ([\cite=KOB98]). Furthermore, the evolution of metallicity with redshift should be considered carefully (see next section), since the results of [\citet=STROLGER10] depend strongly on the SNe Ia sample with z > 1.2. The DTD derived from the sub-sample with z < 1 is consistent with results from low-redshift supernova samples, which are better reproduced by our model. Thus, the properties of SNe Ia with z > 1.2 (their progenitors may form at a red shift as large as 3-4) are interesting.

Recently, By comparing a theoretical DTD and an observational one from [\citet=TOTANI08], [\citet=Mennekens10] claimed that the DTD from the single degenerate model is incompatible with observations, which is mainly derived from a lower birth rate of SNe Ia at long delay time, especially at a time longer than 8 Gyr. Metallicity may improve the situation of the SD model since a low metallicity may increase the birth rate of SNe Ia from WD + RG channel as suggested in this paper and after all, the DTD derived from the SD model by [\citet=MENGYANG10a] is not incompatible with observations.

the evolution of DTD with redshift

Generally, the mean value of metallicity decreases slowly with redshift. Based on the results in this paper, the mean delay time of SNe Ia could thus increases with redshift. However, the evolution of metallicity is not a simple, monotonic function of redshift. Metallicity shows a significant scatter at all redshifts and the scatter increases with redshift ([\cite=NAAGAMINE01]). At [formula], the mean value of metallicity is close to 0.005 . According to the results here, the progenitors of SNe Ia formed at this redshift interval would then explode at an interval of [formula], and the delay time could be shorter than 2.75 Gyr. Even at z = 5, the mean metallicity is 0.004. The progenitor stars formed at such high redshifts contribute to SNe Ia exploding at z > 2, which is beyond the the scope of SNe Ia sample used by [\citet=STROLGER10]. Stars formed at [formula] usually have a metallicity lower than 0.02, i.e. the metallicity spreads from [formula] and has a mean value of [formula], where [formula] is solar metallicity ([\cite=NAAGAMINE01]). Thus, the progenitors formed at [formula] could not contribute to SNe Ia with long delay times at [formula], and the delay time at this redshift interval should be shorter than 2 Gyr. For stars formed at [formula], the distribution of metallicities is rather uniform, i.e. close to [formula], and these stars mainly contribute to SNe Ia exploding at [formula], which means that SNe Ia at [formula] usually have a delay time shorter than 2 Gyr. So, there is no time at which the average metallicity of Z < 0.001 contributs to the high-redshift sample of [\citet=STROLGER10]. Even if it were, our model would predict [formula]% of the SNe Ia to be "prompt", which is inconsistent with the results of [\citet=STROLGER10]. However, as noticed by [\citet=NAAGAMINE01], the spread of metallicity gradually increases toward high redshift. It takes [formula] at z = 2, but [formula] at z > 3. Thus, there are still a few progenitor stars formed at z > 3 which could contribute to SNe Ia with long delay times at [formula]. So, although metallicity has no ability to create a DTD matching the discovery of [\citet=STROLGER10], it still partly contributes to the discovery.

The WD + MS channel is the dominant one for SNe Ia, and the discussion above is mainly based on this channel. Although the contribution is small (1% - 16%, see section [\ref=sect:3]), the WD + RG channel contributes to SNe Ia with very long delay times, i.e. longer than 3.5 Gyr. So the SNe Ia from this channel could only be discovered at z < 2, and the progenitor stars formed at z < 4 could contribute to SNe Ia at z < 1.

uncertainties

Obviously, there exist many uncertainties for our discussions in this paper. Firstly, we did not calculate the binary evolution with low metallicity, i.e. we did not obtain the appropriate parameter space for SNe Ia with low metallicity. Fortunately, some works have referred to this problem, i.e. the parameter space for SNe Ia moves to lower secondary mass with the decrease of metallicity, and then a low metallicity leads to a longer delay time ([\cite=MENG09]; [\cite=CHENWC09]). So, as the effect of metallicity on the delay time of SNe Ia, we seem not to obtain a new result. But, since our purpose is to check whether changing metallicity can create DTDs consistent with the results of [\citet=STROLGER10], our work is still meaningful. Then, the following question is whether 0.4 [formula] used here is reasonable although this value is obtained from detailed binary evolution calculation. Actually, the lower boundary of the parameter space for SNe Ia with Z = 0.001 is lower than 0.8 [formula] when we move the parameter space for SNe Ia of Z = 0.02 to a lower companion mass by 0.4 [formula], which means that we obtained an upper limit of the effect of metallicity on the delay time of SNe Ia. In addition, a low metallicity reduces the area of parameter space for SNe Ia ([\cite=NOM99]; [\cite=MENG09]; [\cite=CHENWC09]). However, the area mainly affects the birth rate of SNe Ia, not delay time, i.e. the birth rate of Z = 0.001 obtained here could be taken as an upper limit, but the delay time here is still valid. So, the conclusion that metallicity has no ability to interpret the observation of [\citet=STROLGER10] is reasonable.

Secondly, in the calculation of [\citet=MENGYANG10a], the optically thick wind is assumed ([\cite=HAC96]), which critically depends on the opacity applied, i.e. it is likely that the wind does not work when Z < 0.002 and then SNe Ia should not be observed in metal-poor environments ([\cite=KOB98]). However, this prediction was not uphold by some observations ([\cite=PRIETO08]; [\cite=BADENES09]; [\cite=KHAN10]). To try to avoid arguments, we assume that the wind still works when Z = 0.001 (slightly lower than the metalicity limit of Z = 0.002, see also [\cite=NOM99]), and then the delay time obtained here should be taken as an upper limit. Since the upper limit of delay time can not match with the DTD of [\citet=STROLGER10], our conclusion is still hold no matter which value of metallicity we choose.

Thirdly, the single-degenerate model in [\citet=MENGYANG10a] contains numerous assumptions, which may not be universally accepted. For example, the mass-stripping effect of the optically thick wind and the effect of the thermally instable disk were included ([\cite=HKN08]; [\cite=XL09]). The mass stripping effect mainly affects the birth rate of SNe Ia, i.e. the birth rate may reduce significantly if the effect is not include (see [\cite=WANGB10]). The effect of the thermally instable disk affects not only the birth rate, but also the delay time. If this effect were not include, the birth rate and the delay time would decrease significantly, which might lead to a DTD that is also not consistent with the observation of [\citet=STROLGER10].

Finally, please keep in mind that there is an implicit assumption in this paper that the assumptions used in [\citet=MENGYANG10a] is not affected by metallicity. This assumption is rather arbitrary since great efforts are necessary to support it. Fortunately, some previous studies showed that the influence of metallicity on the assumptions used in SD model could be neglected. For example, the critical accretion rate and the structure of WDs are almost not affected by metallicity ([\cite=MEN06]; [\cite=UME99] [\cite=UME99b]). So, our assumption here might not be a serious problem.

In summary, this paper fails its stated goal: to create a DTD consistent with the measurement of [\citet=STROLGER10] by changing metallicity based on a SD scenario. Metallicity may only partly resolve the long delay-time results of [\citet=STROLGER10]. However, when using the delay time derived from observations to constrain the progenitors of SNe Ia, metallicity should be carefully checked.
