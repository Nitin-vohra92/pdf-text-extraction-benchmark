Surfaces in [formula] with constant principal angles with respect to a plane

Introduction

In [\cite=Jordan] Camille Jordan defined the concept of principal angles between two linear subspaces of the Euclidean space. The principal angles are real numbers between 0 and [formula] which describe the mutual position of the two subspaces. If one subspace has dimension one, the principal angle is just the usual angle between a straight line and a subspace. When both subspaces have dimension two, their principal angles are two real numbers θ1,θ2 such that [formula]

In this work we consider the principal angles between the tangent planes of an immersed surface in [formula] and a fixed plane Π in [formula]. Every tangent plane TpΣ of the surface Σ, considered as a vector subspace of [formula], has two principal angles θ1(p),θ2(p) with the fixed plane Π, which depend on the point p∈Σ. The aim of this article is to investigate local and global geometric properties of those surfaces in which θ1(p),θ2(p) are constant functions. For simplicity, we will call them helix surfaces or constant angles surfaces with respect to a plane.

In the case where the constant angles surface is contained in some hyperplane [formula] of [formula], we show in Proposition [\ref=helices-nonfull], that the surface has a constant angle with respect to a direction in the hyperplane [formula] these surfaces are classified in [\cite=DS-RH] and [\cite=Mu-Ni]. The case of constant angle submanifolds in [formula] with respect to some direction in [formula] was investigated by the second and the last authors in [\cite=DS-RH-II]. Constant angle surfaces with respect to a direction have been investigated very recently also in other Riemannian manifolds, as in the works [\cite=Di-Mu] and [\cite=DFV].

Here is a theorem collecting some of our main results.

Let [formula] be a surface with constant principal angles with respect to a plane [formula]. Then Σ has zero Gauss curvature and has flat normal bundle. If Σ is complete then Σ is an extrinsic product. Moreover, if Σ is compact then Σ is a torus embedded in [formula] as a product of two closed plane curves.

In Section [\ref=preliminaries] we recall basic definitions and properties of principal angles between linear subspaces in [formula] and we introduce the notion of helix (or constant angles) surfaces. In Section [\ref=sec:gauss-map] we study the Gauss map of a helix surface; we show that a surface Σ has constant principal angles if and only if its Gauss map image belongs to a product of circles in [formula]. If Σ is moreover compact then the circles are equators in [formula].

In Section [\ref=section_structure_equations] we write down the structure equations of a constant angles surface in an adapted frame, and in Section [\ref=section_complete_surfaces] we classify the complete helix surfaces such that 0 < θ1  <  θ2  <  π / 2 (the generic case) and such that 0 = θ1  <  θ2  <  π / 2. In Section [\ref=sec:compositions], we characterize the constant angles surfaces which are compositions, a concept studied in [\cite=DT1],[\cite=DT2] and [\cite=DoDa] by Do Carmo, Dajczer and Tojeiro in the context of local isometric immersions of [formula] into [formula] with zero normal curvature. We prove that a generic helix surface is a composition if and only if its first normal space has rank one (Proposition [\ref=CNT]).

In Section [\ref=section_surfaces_spheres] we study constant angles surfaces in spheres of [formula] and in Section [\ref=section_structure] we describe the local structure of constant angles surfaces whose lower principal angle vanishes; we show that these surfaces can be constructed as the union of holonomy tubes along a curve in the normal space of a given curve of [formula] A similar construction was used in [\cite=DO].

In Section [\ref=Ex] and [\ref=section_surfaces_without_geodesic] we show the existence of surfaces with constant principal angles; we use the Cauchy-Kowalewski existence theorem for partial differential equations. In Theorem [\ref=thm:existence-revisited], we show the existence of non trivial helix surfaces with generic principal angles and whose first normal spaces have rank two; in particular these helix surfaces are not compositions. In order to use the Cauchy-Kowalewski theorem we consider the surface Σ as the graph of a local diffeomorphism [formula]. Then we observe that Σ is a helix surface if and only if F is a symplectomorphism whose jacobian matrix has constant length. It is interesting to remark that, by Theorem [\ref=main], a global symplectomorphism [formula] whose Jacobian matrix has constant length is necessarily an affine map.

In the last section, we consider constant angle surfaces with parallel mean curvature vector. We prove in Theorem [\ref=thm:parallel-meancurvature], that the latter condition is equivalent to the fact that Σ is a product.

Preliminaries

Principal angles.

Here we recall the notion of principal angles between two planes in [formula] We refer to [\cite=Jordan] or [\cite=Jiang] for more details.

If [formula] stands for the orthogonal projection on W, the expression [formula] defines a quadratic (positive semidefinite) form on the subspace V. Let us denote by SWV∈Sym(V) the symmetric endomorphism such that

[formula]

The following is well-known.

The eigenvalues of SWV are cos 2(θ1) and cos 2(θ2). In particular, there exists an orthonormal basis (v1,v2) of V such that, for all v = X1v1 + X2v2 belonging to V,

[formula]

The next lemma links the principal angles between V and [formula] to the principal angles between V and W:

Since, for all v∈V, [formula] with [formula] we readily get

[formula]

Thus, by ([\ref=QWV]),

[formula]

Using Proposition [\ref=Lagrange] again (with [formula] instead of W), we deduce that [formula] and [formula] and the result follows.

Given any two angles 0  ≤  θ1  ≤  θ2  ≤  π / 2, there exist two planes V and W in [formula] with these two principal angles.

Let (w1,w2,w3,w4) be an orthonormal basis of [formula] and consider the plane W = span{w1, w2}. Let v1 and v2 be the orthonormal vectors given by

[formula]

Let us define V = span{v1, v2}. Since pW(v1) =  cos (θ1)w2 and pW(v2) =  cos (θ2)w1, writing v = X1v1 + X2v2 we readily get

[formula]

and the result follows from ([\ref=QWV]).

Principal angles and bivectors

We consider the vector space [formula] endowed with its natural scalar product, defined on decomposable bivectors by

[formula]

Let V and W be two oriented planes of [formula] If (v1,v2) and (w1,w2) are positively oriented and orthonormal basis of V and W, we define the angle θ∈[0,π] between V and W by the formula

[formula]

Let us denote by [formula] the angle between V and [formula], where the orientation of [formula] is such that the union of two positively oriented basis of W and [formula] is a positively oriented basis of [formula] Note that [formula] is also the angle between [formula] and W. The following result may be find in [\cite=Jiang], Theorem 5.

Surfaces with constant principal angles.

Recall that a surface [formula] is called full if it is not contained in an affine hyperplane.

Let H be any hyperplane containing the plane Π. Since Σ is compact there exists p∈Σ such that TpΣ  ⊂  H. So, the two planes TpΣ and Π belong to the hyperplane H. Therefore, they have a common straight line and thus a principal angle has to be zero.

If Σ is a compact immersed helix surface in [formula] with respect to a plane, then it has constant principal angles equal to zero and π / 2.

By Lemma [\ref=compactas-tienen-angulo-cero], there exists p∈Σ with a principal angle at p equal to zero. Because Σ is a helix, Σ has a zero principal angle at every point. Now, the same argument applied to [formula] shows that the other principal angle is equal to π / 2 (using also Lemma [\ref=principal-angles-orthogonal]).

There is a natural relation between non full helix surfaces in [formula] with respect to a plane and helix surfaces in [formula] with respect to a direction:

Let Σ be a non full immersed surface in [formula] which is a helix with respect to a plane [formula]. Assume that Σ is contained in [formula] Then Σ is a helix surface in [formula] with respect to some direction in [formula].

First case: Π is contained in the hyperplane [formula]. Let d be a unit vector in [formula] normal to Π. Then Σ is a helix surface with respect to the direction d. Second case: Π is transversal to [formula]. Thus [formula] is a line l in [formula]. Let us denote by d a fixed unit direction in [formula] parallel to l. We prove that Σ is a helix surface with respect to the direction d. For this, consider e4 a unit vector normal to [formula] in [formula] and ξ a local unit vector field orthogonal to Σ in [formula]. Since (ξ,e4) is an orthonormal basis of [formula] the bivector [formula] represents the normal plane [formula] By hypothesis, for every p∈Σ, TpΣ and Π have constant principal angles, and by Lemma [\ref=principal-angles-orthogonal] [formula] and Π also have constant principal angles. Let [formula] be a fixed direction such that (d,w) is an orthonormal basis of Π. We conclude that [formula] is constant (see Lemma [\ref=lemaformulatheta]). Taking the derivative along a direction T tangent to Σ we get

[formula]

since 〈e4,w〉 is constant (e4 and w are fixed directions). Finally, let us observe that 〈e4,w〉  ≠  0: otherwise w would be in [formula] which is not possible since Π, transversal to [formula] is generated by the pair (d, w), with d belonging to [formula] Therefore T.〈ξ,d〉 = 0, which means that 〈ξ,d〉 is constant along Σ. This is equivalent to say that Σ is a helix surface with respect to the direction d.

Characterization of helix surfaces using the Gauss map

The Grassmannian of the oriented 2-planes in [formula] identifies with the set

[formula]

of unit and decomposable bivectors of [formula] Recall that the Hodge operator is the symmetric map [formula] such that [formula] for all [formula] where [formula] is identified with [formula] using the canonical volume form on [formula] Since [formula] [formula] splits into the orthogonal sum

[formula]

where E+  =  {η: * η  =  η} and E-  =  {η: * η =  - η}, and the natural map

[formula]

induces an isometry between Q and the product of spheres [formula] Consider the Gauss map

[formula]

where (e1,e2) is a positively oriented and orthonormal basis of TxΣ. We first give a characterization of an helix surface in terms of its Gauss map image:

Σ is an immersed helix surface in [formula] with respect to a plane if and only if its Gauss map image belongs to a product of circles in [formula]

Fix Π an oriented plane of [formula] represented by [formula] For x∈Σ, G(x) = (η+,η-) represents the plane TxΣ, with its orientation. We define the two angles α+,α- by the formulae

[formula]

The formulae

[formula]

read

[formula]

where θ and [formula] are the angles between Π and TxΣ, and Π and [formula] defined Section [\ref=sectionanglesbivectors]. We thus have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lemaformulatheta] we deduce that the angles α+ and α- are constant if and only if the principal angles θ1,θ2 are, and thus that Σ is an helix surface with respect to Π if and only if its Gauss map image belongs to a product of circles centered at η+0 and η-0 in [formula]

If Σ is a compact immersed helix surface in [formula] with respect to a plane Π, then it has constant principal angles equal to zero and π / 2. That means that its Gauss map image is a product of two equators in [formula]

The first part was proved in Proposition [\ref=mejora-enel-caso-compacto]. Lemma [\ref=lemaformulatheta] and formulae ([\ref=alpha-theta]) imply that the two angles α+ and α- between Π and TpΣ are equal to π / 2, and thus that the Gauss map image is a product of two equators in [formula]

Structure equations

In this section we compute the structure equations (see [\cite=BCO]) of a helix surface in a frame adapted to the helix structure.

Let [formula] be a surface with constant principal angles with respect to the plane [formula]. Let [formula] be a local frame such that T1(p) and T2(p) are unit eigenvectors of SΠTpΣ at every point p∈Σ, and let e1,e2 be the corresponding frame of Π, defined by

[formula]

where ξ1,ξ2 are normal vector fields (θ1 and θ2 still denote the constant principal angles). Note that T1 and T2 (and thus e1, e2, ξ1 and ξ2) do exist since the eigenvalues of SΠTpΣ are constant. Let X be a vector field of Σ. Taking derivatives in both hands we get

[formula]

and

[formula]

We can regard Σ  ×  Π  →  Σ as a trivial bundle endowed with a flat connection D. Then, there exists a function [formula] such that Then from the above equations we get

[formula]

Taking the normal and the tangent components we get

[formula]

[formula]

Here is the first consequence of the above equations.

Indeed, from equations ([\ref=normal]) it follows that

[formula]

Now the first claim follows from Gauss equation and the second from Ricci equation.

In the frame T1,T2 we have

[formula]

where [formula] are two smooth functions, and

[formula]

Define [formula] two smooth functions such that

[formula]

We may thus re-write the structure equations ([\ref=tangente])-([\ref=normal]) as follows:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Observe that equations ([\ref=normal1]) imply the existence of two functions λ1,λ2 such that

[formula]

The fact that m1T2 and m2T1 are gradients also follows from Codazzi equations (C1) and (C2) below.

The case θ1  =  0 and [formula]

Under these assumptions equations ([\ref=tangente1]) and ([\ref=normal1]) are equivalent to

[formula]

and

[formula]

and are thus equivalent to

[formula]

As a consequence we get the following result.

Under the above assumptions the vector field T2 is geodesic.

Indeed, from the second equation of the system ([\ref=zero]) it follows that [formula] which implies [formula].

The generic case

By the generic case we mean the case in which the principal angles [formula]. Under this hypothesis, we may eliminate df in the first equation of ([\ref=tangente1]) using successively the second, the third, and the last equation in ([\ref=tangente1])-({[\ref=normal1]), to get the system

[formula]

Codazzi equations

Here we compute the Codazzi equations. Since

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

the Codazzi equations are satisfied if and only if

[formula]

Observe that (C1) (resp. (C3)) is equivalent to m1T2 (resp. m2T1) be a gradient.

Complete surfaces with constant principal angles.

The generic case

Here we show that a complete surface [formula] with constant principal angles [formula] is totally geodesic.

From equation ([\ref=dependencia1]) the differential dt is a linear combination of dλ1,dλ2. Namely,

[formula]

where A,B are constants which depend on θ1,θ2. The following lemma is crucial.

Keep in mind that

[formula]

For the first equality we have to show that

[formula]

and

[formula]

We compute

[formula]

which proves ( *  * ). The proof of ( * ) is analogous:

[formula]

The proof of the second equality is analogous and is therefore omitted. This proves the lemma.

Assume that [formula] with constant principal angles θ1,θ2 such that [formula] is a complete surface. Then Σ is totally geodesic.

Indeed, taking inner product with [formula] in both sides of the first equation of the above lemma we get

[formula]

Then along the flow FT2t of the vector field T2 the function [formula] satisfies

[formula]

Observe that B  ≠  0 because θ2  ≠  0. Since the flow of T2 is complete it is not difficult to see that [formula]. This shows [formula].

Analogously, taking the inner product with [formula] in both sides of the second equation of the above lemma we get

[formula]

Then along the flow FT1t of the vector field T1 the function [formula] satisfies

[formula]

Note that A  ≠  0 because θ1  ≠  0. Since the flow of T1 is complete we get that [formula]. This shows [formula]. Thus [formula] and Σ is totally geodesic.

Let [formula] by a symplectomorphism and let Jf be its Jacobian matrix. If [formula] is a constant function then f is affine.

As explained in Proposition [\ref=symplecto] below the graph of such a symplectomorphism can be used to construct a surface with constant principal angles. Since it is an entire graph it is complete, and the above theorem implies that the graph is totally geodesic. Thus, f must be an affine map.

Complete surfaces with θ1  =  0

Here we prove that a complete not totally geodesic surface with constant principal angles is a product.

Assume [formula] with constant principal angles such that θ1 = 0 to be complete and not totally geodesic. Then T1,T2 are parallel vector fields and Σ is an extrinsic product.

If [formula] from the first equation in ([\ref=tangente1]) we get dt = 0, and thus that T1 and T2 are parallel vector fields. So assume [formula]. As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:generic-complete] (using Lemma [\ref=eq.dif.] and B  ≠  0) we get that λ2 is a constant function. The second equation in ([\ref=zero]) then implies dt = 0, and thus that T1 and T2 are parallel vector fields. That Σ is an extrinsic product follows from the well-known Moore's Lemma [\cite=BCO] since [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main].

The first claim was already proved in Lemma [\ref=flat]. The second claim is a consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm:generic-complete] and Theorem [\ref=thm:complete-angulo-zero]. The third part is a consequence of the previous theorem since a compact surface is complete.

Do Carmo-Dajczer-Tojeiro compositions

In [\cite=DT1],[\cite=DT2] and [\cite=DoDa] local isometric immersions of [formula] into [formula] were studied. The authors introduced the concept of compositions: an isometric immersion [formula] is called a composition (or is said to be trivial) if there exist isometric immersions [formula] and [formula] such that

[formula]

Since the surfaces [formula] with constant principal angles are flat it is natural to understand when they are compositions.

Let [formula] be a surface with constant principal angles [formula]. The following facts are equivalent:

Σ is a composition,

the first normal space N1 has rank one,

either T1 or T2 is a totally geodesic vector field.

We first prove (i)  ⇒  (ii) by contradiction. Assume that [formula] is a composition such that rank(N1) = 2. It follows from [\cite=DoDa] that either [formula] or [formula]. Then Codazzi equation (C2) or (C4) implies that either T1 or T2 is totally geodesic. Assume first that T1 is totally geodesic. Then equation ([\ref=dependencia1]) implies [formula] which in turn implies [formula] and contradicts the hypothesis rank(N1)  =  2. A similar argument shows that if T2 is geodesic then [formula] and so rank(N1) = 1, a contradiction. Thus (i) implies (ii). (ii)  ⇒  (i) is proved in [\cite=DT1]. (iii)  ⇒  (ii) follows from equation ([\ref=dependencia1]) and (ii)  ⇒  (iii) from Codazzi equations.

A surface [formula] with constant principal angles [formula] is a composition since it is a product. In general, a product has first normal space N1 of rank 2.

Let [formula] be a surface with constant principal angles such that θ1  =  0. Then Σ is a composition.

If rank(N1)  =  1 then the claim follows from [\cite=DT1]. Assume rank(N1)  =  2. Equations ([\ref=zero]) imply dn(T1)  =  0 and so by [\cite=DoDa] we get that Σ is a composition.

Constant angles surfaces in spheres

A product of two circles is a surface of constant principal angles contained in a sphere. The aim of this section is to classify the surfaces with constant principal angles contained in some sphere. Along this section we assume [formula] to be a surface of constant principal angles with respect to the plane [formula]. The following lemma is well-known:

Now assume that Σ is contained in some sphere. Then there exists a function θ such that the normal vector field ξ defined as

[formula]

is normal, parallel and such that [formula] δ  ≠  0.

If ξ  =   cos (θ)ξ1  +   sin (θ)ξ2, we have

[formula]

Thus Aξ  =  δId if and only if the first two equations in ([\ref=system_sphere]) hold. Moreover, recalling ([\ref=def_t_n]), we get

[formula]

and the vector fielf ξ is parallel if and only if the last equation in ([\ref=system_sphere]) holds.

We now prove by contradiction that θ1 = 0 or θ2  =  π / 2. Equations ([\ref=dependencia1])-([\ref=dependencia3]) together with ([\ref=system_sphere]) and Codazzi equations (C1)-(C2) give the following system for dθ(T1),dθ(T2),dt(T1) and dt(T2):

Observe that the values of dθ(T1),dθ(T2),dt(T1) and dt(T2) are given by the first two and the last two equations. Then using equation (3 - T2) we easily get

[formula]

So we have a contradiction unless either θ1  =  0 or [formula].

Assume that θ1  =  0 (the case [formula] is reduced to that case, switching the role of Π and [formula]). Since Σ is flat we can take local coordinates (x,y) where the metric is given by dx2  +  dy2. Using the structure equations ([\ref=zero]), we see that the flow lines of T2 are level curves of the functions λ2 and t, whereas the flow lines of T1 are the level curves of λ1,n and θ. Thus the vector field T2 is geodesic and its flow in (x,y) consists of straight lines, and we get a nice intrinsic description of the surface using Fermi coordinates. Namely, let γ(s) be the arc length parametrization of a level curve of the function θ and let (s,r) be the Fermi coordinates around a point of γ. The flat metric dx2  +  dy2 is expressed in coordinates (s,r) as

[formula]

where κ(s) is the curvature of γ(s). As explained above the function θ only depends on r, and the function t only on s. We have

[formula]

Moreover, using the second equation in ([\ref=zero]), the very definition of m2 and the second equation in ([\ref=system_sphere]), we get

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Taking r = 0 we see that t'(s) is a constant, t'0, which is such that

[formula]

thus κ(s) is a constant, κ0. This shows that the flow lines of T1 are arcs of circles in coordinates x,y. Actually, the flow lines of T1 are arcs of circles in the space [formula]. To see this, observe that the flow lines of T1 are contained in a plane parallel to Π because T1 is always tangent to Π. The absolute value of the curvature of a given flow line of T1 is given by

[formula]

which does not depend on the parameter s. So the flow lines of T1 are arcs of circles contained in parallel planes. We have the following result.

Let [formula] be a surface with constant principal angles with respect to the plane [formula]. If Σ is contained in a sphere [formula] then either θ1  =  0 or [formula] and Σ is a surface of revolution around a fixed plane [formula] obtained by revolving a spherical helix curve of [formula].

Let C be a flow line of T1. As explained above C is an arc of circle contained in a plane parallel to Π. So we can assume C  ⊂  Π. Let p∈C and let [formula] be the flow line of T2 starting from p. Notice that the vectors ξ(r): = γ(r)  -  p are always perpendicular to C at p. Indeed,

[formula]

since dt(T2) = 0 (T2 is geodesic). This shows that T1 is constant in [formula] along γ(r) and thus that the vectors ξ(r): = γ(r)  -  p are always perpendicular to C at p. In other words, the curve γ(r) is contained in the normal space νp(C) of the curve [formula]. The above discussion is independent of the point p∈C. Denote by γp(r) the corresponding curve in νp(C). Now fix r  =  r0, and let ξr0(p): = p  -  γp(r0) be a field of normal vectors along C (assuming that p varies in C). Observe that the derivative of γp(r0) in the direction of T1 is a multiple of T1 because T1 is parallel along γp. This shows that the normal vector field ξr0(p) is parallel with respect to the normal connection of C. Since C is a circle contained in Π the parallel transport with respect to the normal connection is given by the rotations around Π which fix [formula].

Now fix p0∈C. Identifying the normal space νp0(C) to [formula] we see that the flow line γ(r) of T2 starting at p0 is a classical helix curve of [formula] with respect to [formula], where Np0 is the unit normal at p0 of C  ⊂  Π. Indeed, [formula] and, as we explained above, γ(r)  ⊂  νp0(C). Since γ(r) is a helix curve and since it is contained in Σ it follows that γ(r) is a spherical helix; see [\cite=GAS] for a complete discussion about such curves.

It is interesting to notice that the above proof shows that Σ is the union of the so called holonomy tubes (see [\cite=BCO]) over C starting with the normal vectors of the curve γ(r). A similar construction was used in [\cite=DO] to give local examples of non isoparametric immersions of spheres with curvature normals of constant length.

Structure of constant angle surfaces when θ1  =  0

Here we show that any surface Σ with constant principal angles θ1 = 0 and arbitrary θ2 with respect to a plane Π is (up to rigid motion) a union of holonomy tubes over a plane curve C  ⊂  Π. More precisely, there exists a curve γ  ⊂  νp(C) such that Σ is locally the union of the holonomy tubes of C through the points of γ.

Any surface Σ with constant principal angles θ1 = 0 and arbitrary θ2 with respect to a plane Π is (up to rigid motion) a union of holonomy tubes over a plane curve C  ⊂  Π. Moreover, if γ  ⊂  νp(C) is the curve of the starting points of the tubes, then γ is a helix curve of [formula]

Observe that the structure equations ([\ref=zero]) imply that T2 is a geodesic vector field. Now, as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=spherical] we introduce flat coordinates x,y and Fermi coordinates r,s, where s is the arc length parameter of a level curve C of the function n, i.e. a flow line of the vector field T1. Since T1 is always tangent to Π we can assume that C  ⊂  Π. Fix p0∈C  ⊂  Π and let [formula] be the flow line of T2 starting from p0. So γ(r)  ⊂  νp0(C) since T1 is constant in [formula] along γ(r). Then the same argument as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=spherical] shows that the holonomy tubes through γ(r) are contained in Σ. Thus, Σ is locally the union of such holonomy tubes. Finally, notice that [formula] is a helix curve with respect to [formula] i.e. is a curve of constant slope with respect to the normal vector Np0 of C at p0.

Actually any surface Σ with constant principal angles with either T1 or T2 geodesic can be described as a union of holonomy tubes over a curve C by using a helix curve γp  ⊂  νp(C) as starting points of the holonomy tubes; moreover, the point p may be arbitrarily chosen. Notice that the helices (γp)p∈C are all congruent since the parallel transport with respect to the normal connection is an isometry between the normal spaces. So, surfaces with a geodesic vector field T1 or T2 are union of congruent helix curves.

Existence

In this section we discuss the existence of non-trivial surfaces [formula] with prescribed constant principal angles with respect to a plane Π. More precisely, we seek a surface Σ such that θ1 and θ2 belong to (0,π / 2); Σ is thus locally the graph of a function [formula]. Taking orthonormal bases of Π and [formula] and writing F(x,y) = (f(x,y),g(x,y)) in these bases, the surface [formula] is locally parametrized by

[formula]

Let ∂x: = (1,0,fx(x,y),gx(x,y)),∂y: = (0,1,fy(x,y),gy(x,y)) be a basis of the tangent plane [formula]. As usual, let [formula] denote the coefficients of the metric tensor of Σ in the coordinates (x,y), i.e.

[formula]

Set [formula]. Then the symmetric operator SΠW defined Section [\ref=section_principal_angles] satisfies

[formula]

So the matrix of SΠW in (∂x,∂y) is the inverse of the matrix of the metric, i.e.

[formula]

We deduce the following proposition.

With the notation above, Σ has constant principal angles with respect to the plane Π if and only if the matrix tensor [formula] has constant eigenvalues.

Let [formula] be a surface with constant principal angles with respect to a plane Π. If the principal angle θ1 has multiplicity 2 then Σ is totally geodesic, i.e. is an open subset of a 2-plane.

If the principal angle θ1 has multiplicity 2 then the immersion is orthogonal, i.e. [formula]. Thus [formula] and [formula] are constants. This implies that there exist constants c1,c2 such that the map (x,y)  →  (c1f(x,y),c2g(x,y)) is a local isometry of [formula]. Thus f,g are linear functions and Σ is totally geodesic.

Since SΠW has constant eigenvalues if and only if its characteristic polynomial does not depend on the point (x,y), we get:

With the notation above, Σ has constant principal angles θ1,θ2∈(0,π / 2) with respect to the plane Π if and only if

[formula]

Since

[formula]

in order to show the existence of surfaces with constant principal angles we have to solve the following PDE system:

[formula]

Taking the square root we get the equivalent system

[formula]

Since c2  ≠  0 we can divide both hands by c2 and obtain the following proposition.

There exists a non totally geodesic surface with constant principal angles if and only if there exists a non linear local symplectomorphism of [formula] whose Jacobian matrix has constant length.

Assume that such a surface exists, and set [formula]. Then the system above implies that ψ is a non linear local symplectomorphism of [formula] whose Jacobian matrix has constant length. The converse follows from the equivalences above.

Construction of local symplectomorphisms

We prove the following existence result:

There exist non linear local symplectomorphisms of [formula] whose Jacobian matrix has constant length. Thus, there exist non totally geodesic surfaces with different constant principal angles.

As explained above we have to show the existence of non linear solutions of the system

[formula]

where c1  ≠  2 (if c1 = 2, by Corollary [\ref=iguales] the solutions are linear functions).

Assume that f is a (non constant) known function and set A  =  gx,B = gy. Then from the second equation in ([\ref=system_c2=1]) there exists a function λ such that

[formula]

Using the first equation in ([\ref=system_c2=1]), λ satisfies

[formula]

and setting Δ: = f2x  +  f2y, this last equation reads

[formula]

Notice that c1  ≥  2, and that c1  =  2 implies [formula] and [formula]. So if [formula] and [formula] then f is harmonic with a gradient of constant length. Then it is not difficult to show (using the theory of complex functions) that f must be linear. This gives another proof of Corollary [\ref=iguales].

The norm of the gradient Δ is necessarily bounded by

[formula]

Assume that c1  >  2. Then f is a solution of the following second order quasi-linear PDE:

[formula]

Reciprocally, if f is a non linear solution of the above equation then it is possible to construct g such that F(x,y) = (f(x,y),g(x,y)) is a (non linear) symplectomorphism whose Jacobian matrix has constant length. The existence of such symplectomorphism, i.e. the proof of Theorem [\ref=hay], follows from the following theorem.

Let

[formula]

be a second order quasi-linear operator with analytic coefficients A,B,C,E defined in some open subset [formula]. Then there exists a non linear function [formula] such that [formula].

We can apply the Cauchy-Kowalewski theorem to solve the equation [formula] as soon as we can find non characteristic real analytic initial data (see [\cite=J] for details). Let us set, as it is standard, p  =  fx,q  =  fy. Let g be the quadratic differential form defined on [formula] by

[formula]

Notice that g is not identically zero since [formula] is a differential operator of second order. So we can find an analytic vector field V such that

[formula]

around a point I0  =  (p0,q0)∈Ω. We can also consider (p0,q0) as a point in the (x,y) plane. So V(x,y) is also a vector field around (p0,q0) in the plane (x,y). It is not difficult to see that there exists a non constant analytic curve γ(t) such that γ(0)  =  (p0,q0) and 〈γ'(t),V(γ(t))〉  =  0, where 〈,〉 is the standard scalar product of [formula] i.e. such that V is normal to γ. Consider the following initial conditions on γ(t) for the Cauchy problem for the quasi-linear PDE:

[formula]

Then these initial conditions are analytic and non characteristic. Indeed, the condition g(V,V)  ≠  0 holds for the initial data [formula] (since [formula]) and this is exactly the condition on the initial data to be non characteristic. Thus we can apply the Cauchy-Kowalewski theorem to get a solution f around (p0,q0). Moreover [formula] is not constant since [formula].

Existence of surfaces without geodesic principal directions

Here we show that there exist surfaces with constant principal angles such that both vector fields T1 or T2 are not geodesic.

The rank of the first normal space of a graph.

Assume that Σ is parametrized by F(x,y)  =  (x,y,f(x,y),g(x,y)). The tangent space at the point F(x,y) is generated by the vectors

[formula]

and the normal space by the vectors

[formula]

The first normal space of the graph is generated by the normal vectors

[formula]

where [formula] means the normal component.

Writing

[formula]

and

[formula]

by straightforward computations we get

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the Gram matrix of N1,N2. Since the first normal space of the graph F(x,y) has rank one if and only if the matrix

[formula]

has rank one, and since the Gram matrix G is invertible, the first normal space of the graph F(x,y) has rank one if and only if the matrix

[formula]

has rank one.

Notice that the matrix

[formula]

has rank one if and only if there exists a function [formula] such that

[formula]

If M is constant in some open subset of Ω then f,g,1 are linearly independent over [formula]. So assume that M is not constant. Taking the exterior derivative we get

[formula]

Since dM  ≠  0 we get [formula] which implies that the determinant of the Hessian of f vanishes identically.

The existence revisited

Recall from Section [\ref=Ex] that to construct a graph with constant principal angles we need a solution of the partial differential equation

[formula]

where Δ: = f2x  +  f2y. We are going to show that there exist analytical solutions f with non vanishing determinant [formula]. According to Lemmas [\ref=N1] and [\ref=N2], this will imply that the first normal spaces of the graph of (f,g) have rank 2 (the function g is arbitrary). Finally, Proposition [\ref=CNT] yields that in this example neither of the two vector fields T1 or T2 is geodesic.

So we are going to prove the following theorem and its corollary.

There exist surfaces [formula] with constant principal angles [formula] such that their first normal spaces have rank 2. For such a surface the vector fields T1 and T2 are not geodesic.

There exist surfaces [formula] with constant principal angles [formula] which are not compositions in the sense of Do Carmo-Dajczer.

As explained above it is enough to show the existence of a solution f of the PDE ([\ref=pde]) with non vanishing determinant [formula]. Let E(u,v) be the analytic function defined by

[formula]

where Δ: = u2  +  v2; equation ([\ref=pde]) thus reads

[formula]

or

[formula]

We look for a solution of this equation with the initial conditions where ψ and φ are two functions such that

[formula]

This means that the initial conditions are not characteristics; thus an analytic solution f of equation ([\ref=pde]) does exist by the Cauchy-Kowalewski theorem. Moreover, since [formula] and fxx(x,0).fyy(x,0)  ≠  0 we see that the Hessian of f does not vanish and thus that the rank of the first normal space is equal to 2. In particular the graph is not totally geodesic.

We finally prove the existence of ψ and φ such that conditions ([\ref=condition_non_char]) hold. Notice that the function E(u,v) is defined in the annulus [formula] where it is moreover analytic. Also notice that Eu and Ev do no vanish identically. Let B  ⊂  A be the subset such that either Eu(u,v)  =  0 or Ev( - v,u) = 0. Then B  ≠  A and since B is closed there exists an open disc D  ⊂  A such that [formula]. If u0,v0 are the coordinates of the center of D, the functions φ(x)  =  x2  +  xu0 and ψ(x)  =  x  +  v0 for small values of x satisfy the system of initial conditions ().

Deformations

Here we explain how to use a solution f of the PDE ([\ref=pde]) in order to locally construct a surface with constant principal angles θ1,θ2. Actually, we will show that a solution f produces a one parameter deformation [formula] of flat surfaces with constant principal angles.

Let f be a solution of the PDE ([\ref=pde]). Then there exists g such that

[formula]

so we have

[formula]

Let Fm(x,y): = (mf(x,y),mg(x,y)), with [formula]. As explained in Proposition [\ref=graficoHelice], the graph of Fm is a surface with constant principal angles θ1,θ2 if and only if

[formula]

i.e. if and only if

[formula]

Thus the graph of Fm is a surface Σm with constant principal angles

[formula]

It is not difficult to see that the map (m,c)  →  (θ1,θ2) from (0, +   ∞  )  ×  (2, +   ∞  ) into [formula] is surjective. This shows how to construct the surface Σm with constant principal angles θ1,θ2 by starting with a solution f of the PDE ([\ref=pde]).

Surfaces with parallel mean curvature

Here we classify surfaces [formula] having parallel mean curvature vector field [formula]. Recall that the mean curvature vector [formula] is the normal vector field given by

[formula]

We have the following result.

Let [formula] be a surface with constant principal angles. The mean curvature vector [formula] is parallel if and only if Σ is a product. Hence, up to a rigid motion, Σ is either an open subset of a torus [formula] or an open subset of the cylinder [formula], where [formula] is an helix, i.e. a curve with constant curvature and torsion.

It is enough to show that T1 and T2 are geodesic vector fields. Indeed, since [formula] Moore's Lemma implies that Σ is a local product. The vector field [formula] is parallel if and only if

[formula]

If m1 and m2 are constant functions then the Codazzi equations imply that both T1,T2 are geodesic vector fields. So we can assume that m1 or m2 is not constant. Observe that the above equations imply that if one is not constant so is the other. So we have that both functions m1 and m2 are not constant. Now we have

[formula]

Thus [formula] i.e. T1 is a geodesic vector field. In a similar way we have

[formula]

Thus [formula] i.e. T2 is a geodesic vector field.
