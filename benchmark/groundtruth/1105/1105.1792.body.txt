Cyanoacetylene in IC 342: An Evolving Dense Gas Component with Starburst Age

Introduction

Little is known about the properties of the dense gas component on GMC scales in external galaxies yet it is dense gas (nH2  >  104 cm- 3) that most directly correlates with global star formation rates [\citep=GS04] [\citep=WEGSSV05]. To understand the evolution and regulation of current star formation in galaxies, dense gas properties need to be accurately characterized.

In a recent imaging survey of millimeter-wave molecular lines in the nearby spiral nucleus of IC 342, a surprising degree of morphological variation is observed in its dense gas [\citep=MT05], which was not anticipated from CO or HCN [\citep=I90] [\citep=DRGGGM92]. These and other observations [\citep=GMFN00] [\citep=GMFN01] [\citep=GMFUN02] [\citep=UGFMR04] [\citep=UGMFN06] confirm that CO and HCN fail to fully constrain excitation and chemical properties of the dense clouds. Various probes of the dense component exist, each with various strengths and weaknesses [\citep=MT05] [\citep=P07] [\citep=Bet08] [\citep=NCSDHW08] [\citep=KNGMCGE08] [\citep=GGPFU08]. HCN(1-0) is the most commonly used dense gas tracer, primarily because it is bright, however, it is optically thick in most starburst environments [\citep=DRGGGM92] [\citep=MT04] [\citep=KWWBRM07], has a widely spaced rotational ladder with its J>  3 transitions in the submm and can be sensitive to chemical effects [\citep=FMCB93] [\citep=APHC02].

Here we present a study of the physical conditions of the very dense gas component of a nearby starburst nucleus using HC3N. With its large electric dipole moment (μ = 3.72 debye versus 3.0 debye for HCN), low opacity and closely spaced rotational ladder accessible to powerful centimeter and millimeter-wave interferometers, HC3N is well-suited to high resolution imaging of the structure and excitation of the densest component of the molecular gas [\citep=MTPZ76] [\citep=VLSW83] [\citep=AMMMB11]. HC3N(5-4) has a critical density of 5  ×  104 cm- 3 and an upper level energy of E/k = 6.6 K; the 16-15 line has a critical density of 5  ×  105 cm- 3 and an upper level energy of E/k = 59 K.

We have observed the J = 5-4 and J = 16-15 lines of HC3N at <  2arcsec resolution in IC 342 with the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdB), respectively. IC 342 is one of the closest [\citep=SCH02] [\citep=K05], large spirals with active nuclear star formation [\citep=BGMNSWW80] [\citep=TH83]. It is nearly face-on, with bright molecular line emission both in dense clouds and a diffuse medium [\citep=Letal84] [\citep=I90] [\citep=DRGGGM92] [\citep=TH92]. The wealth of data and proximity of IC 342 permit the connection of cloud properties with star formation at sub-GMC spatial scales. The data published here represent the first high resolution maps of HC3N(5-4) and HC3N(16-15) in an external galaxy. Excitation is a key component in the interpretation of molecular line intensities. So these two maps are compared with the previously published lower resolution HC3N(10-9) map made with the Owens Valley Millimeter Array [\citep=MT05], to constrain the physical conditions of the densest component of the ISM in the center of IC342, and to correlate properties of the dense gas with star formation, diffuse gas, and chemistry.

Observations

Aperture synthesis observations of the HC3N J=5-4 rotational line (45.490316 GHz) towards IC 342 were made with the D configuration of the VLA on 2005 November 25 (VLA ID: AM839). The synthesized beam is 1×  1 (FWHM); position angle (pa)=-11.2. Fifteen 1.5625 MHz channels were used, for a velocity resolution of 10.3 km s- 1, centered at vLSR = 30  km s- 1. The phase center is α(J2000) = 03h46m48 3; δ(J2000) = 68 05 47. Amplitude tracking and pointing was done by observing the quasar 0228+673 every 45 minutes. Phases were tracked by fast switching between the source and the quasar 0304+655 with 130s/50s cycles. Absolute flux calibration was done using 3C48 and 3C147 and is good to ~  5-10%. Calibration and analysis was performed with the NRAO Astronomical Image Processing Software (AIPS) package. The naturally weighted and CLEANed datacube has an rms of 0.70 mJy beam- 1. Correction for the primary beam (~  1 at 45 GHz) has not been applied. The shortest baselines in the dataset are ≃5 kλ, corresponding to scales of ~  40arcsec; structures larger than this are not well-sampled.

The HC3N(16-15) line emission in the center of IC 342 was observed with 5 antennas using the new 2 mm receivers of the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer (PdBI) on 2007 December 28 and 31 in C configuration with baselines ranging from 24 to 176 m. The phase center of the observations was set to α(J2000) = 03h46m48 105; δ(J2000) = 68 05 47. NRAO 150 and 0212+735 served as phase calibrators and were observed every 20 min. Flux calibrators were 3C84 and 3C454.3. The calibration was done in the GILDAS package following standard procedures. The HC3N(16-15) line at 145.560951 GHz was observed assuming a systemic velocity of vLSR = 46  km s- 1 and a spectral resolution of 2.5 MHz (5.15 km s- 1). The average 2 mm continuum was obtained by averaging line-free channels blue and redward of the HC3N and H2CO lines and subtracted from the uv datacube to obtain a continuum-free datacube. The final naturally weighted and CLEANed datacube with 10 km s- 1 wide channels has a CLEAN beam of 1.83"×  1.55", pa=46o and an rms of 1.7 mJy/beam.

Single-dish observations of HC3N(16-15) find a peak brightness temperature of 6.7 mK in a 16.9'' beam [\citep=AMMMB11]. Convolving our map to this beam and sampling it at the same location yields a peak brightness of 7.1 mK, which agrees within the uncertainties of both datasets. Therefore no flux is resolved out of the interferometer maps, as expected for these high density tracers.

Results

The Dense Cloud Morphology

Continuum subtracted integrated intensity line maps of HC3N(5-4), HC3N(10-9) and HC3N(16-15) in IC 342 are shown in Figure [\ref=inti]. Figure [\ref=inticont] shows the 5-4 transition overlaid on the 7 mm continuum image generated from offline channels. Locations of giant molecular cloud (GMC) cores [\citep=DRGGGM92] [\citep=MT01] and the optical clusters [\citep=SBM03], compared with HC3N(5-4) and HCN(1-0) [\citep=DRGGGM92], are also shown in Figure [\ref=inticont]. Figure [\ref=spec] shows the HC3N(5-4) and HC3N(16-15) spectra (in flux units) taken over the same 2arcsec aperture centered on each cloud.

HC3N(5-4) emission picks out most clouds seen in other dense gas tracers (e.g HCN(1-0). The only labeled cloud not clearly detected in HC3N(5-4) is GMC B, the cloud associated with the nuclear star-forming region [\citep=BGMNSWW80] [\citep=TH83]. Positions of the GMCs measured in HC3N are consistent with those fitted in C18O(2-1) to within a beam [\citep=MT01]. An additional GMC is detected in HC3N(5-4) just south of GMC C3, labeled C4. Unlike C18O(2-1) which peaks at GMC C2, HC3N(5-4) emission peaks farther north, towards GMC C1, at a distance of 105 pc from the nucleus suggesting changes in excitation across GMC C. GMCs A and D' are resolved into two components, but we do not discuss them as separate entities given the lower signal-to-noise, other than to state that there is a clear difference in velocity centroid between the 5-4 and 16-15 transitions (e.g. Figure [\ref=spec]) indicating there is likely an excitation gradient across GMC A. No emission > 2σ is detected towards the weak CO(2-1) feature associated with the central nuclear star cluster [\citep=SBM03].

The J=16-15 line intensity is comparable to that of J=5-4 line in all clouds. While dominated by GMC C, HC3N(16-15) is detected (or tentatively detected) towards all clouds, except GMC D. Fluxes for GMCs D and D' are quite uncertain since they are just inside the half power point of the PdBI primary beam. That GMC C is much brighter than the other clouds in both transitions indicates large quantities of dense gas are present in this cloud. HC3N(16-15) favors C2 over C1. GMC B, while still faint in an absolute sense, is significantly brighter in HC3N(16-15) relative to 5-4. This is not unexpected given the higher excitation requirements of the 16-15 line and that both B and C2 have 7 mm continuum sources associated with massive star formation.

Gas Excitation and the HC3N Δ J Line Ratios

Comparisons of the HC3N (5-4), (10-9) and (16-15) maps provide a chance to establish the excitation of the densest molecular cloud gas component. Line intensities from the J=5-4 and J=16-15 lines were measured over 2arcsec apertures centered on each of the GMCs. Table [\ref=Tinti] records gaussian fits to each spectrum along with integrated line intensities. Peak antenna temperature ratios are calculated for HC3N(16-15)/HC3N(5-4), hereafter denoted R16 / 5. R16 / 5 ranges from less than 0.06 up to ~  0.5, with GMC B having the highest value (Table [\ref=Trat]). The 5-4 and 16-15 transitions generally bracket the peak of the level populations, so we achieve good constraints on gas excitation. LTE excitation temperatures, Tex, implied by R16 / 5 range from <  10 K to >  18 K (where we have neglected Tcmb in this determination). Excitation is lowest towards GMCs D, D' and E. These excitation temperatures Tex are similar to those found from the presumably much less dense gas traced in C18O [\citep=MT01]. Only the GMC C clouds have significantly higher Tex in HC3N -- towards C1 - C3 Tex(HC3N) are about a factor of two greater than Tex(C18O).

The resolution of the HC3N(10-9) data is significantly lower than it is for the 5-4 and 16-15 lines. To compare J=5-4 and J=10-9 line intensities, the 5-4 data were convolved to the resolution of the (10-9) data [\citep=MT01], then integrated intensity ratios, hereafter R10 / 5, were sampled at the locations of R16 / 5. Though at lower resolution than R16 / 5, we make the approximation that R10 / 5 does not change on these sub-GMC scales. While leading to larger uncertainties, this provides a way to include all three transitions in modeling dense gas excitation at very high resolution. R10 / 5 range from 0.25 to 1.4 (Table [\ref=Tinti]). GMC B has the highest value of 1.4. The remainder of the GMCs have ratios of 0.3  <  R10 / 5  <  0.6. Excitation temperatures implied by these ratios range from Tex  =   6-16 K, consistent with those derived from R16 / 5 separately. Tex derived from R10 / 5 are similar to those derived from C18O. The only exception here is GMC A, the cloud where PDRs (Photon-Dominated Regions) dominate [\citep=MT05]. Towards GMC A Tex(C18O) and Tex(R16 / 5) are 12 - 13 K, twice that of Tex(R10 / 5).

Before modeling the densities implied by the line ratios, we test whether IR pumping can be responsible for the observed excitation. IR pumping is important if,

[formula]

where vibBul is the Einstein Bul of the corresponding ν7 = 1 vibrational transitions at ~  45  ~  μm, Iν(45 μm) is the 45 μm intensity as seen by the HC3N molecules and rotAul is the Einstein Aul of the rotational state [\citep=CA10]. It is extremely difficult to estimate the applicable 45 μm IR intensity, but it is expected to be most intense towards the starburst GMC (B). A detailed assessment of IR pumping must await high resolution MIR maps, but we constrain Iν(45 μm) in several ways. First, we take the 45 μm flux from [\citet=Brandl06] and scale it by the fraction of total 20 μm flux that comes from within 2.1'' of the starburst as found by [\citet=BGMNSWW80] and then average over that aperture. For the average Iν(45 μm) calculated this way, vibBul ~ Iν(45 μm) is 10- 4 (10- 2.5) times too low to pump the 16-15 (5-4) transition. Alternatively if we (very conservatively) take the total MIR luminosity from the central 30'' and assume it comes from a blackbody of the observed color temperature [\citep=BGMNSWW80] then Iν(45 μm) is still at least an order of magnitude too low to meet the inequality in eq. [\ref=pump] for both transition. IR pumping rates only become comparable to rotAul for the 5-4 transition if the total IR luminosity originates from a ~  2.5 pc source with a source temperature of [formula]100 K. We conclude that IR pumping is not important for the 16-15 transition of HC3N in any reasonable geometry of the IR field. For the 5-4 transition to be sensitive to IR pumping, the IR source must be warm, opaque and extremely compact. Therefore IR pumping is neglected for all clouds in the following discussion.

Physical Conditions of IC 342's Dense Gas -- LVG Modeling

The values of the excitation temperature constrain the density and kinetic temperatures, nH2 and Tk, and the physical conditions of the clouds driving the excitation. A series of Large Velocity Gradient (LVG) radiative transfer models were run to predict the observed intensities and line ratios for a given nH2, Tk and filling factor, fa  =  Ωsource  /  Ωbeam, of the dense component [\citep=VLSW83]. Single component LVG models are instructive, particularly when lines are optically thin, as is the case for HC3N. The LVG model used is that of [\citet=MTH00], adapted to HC3N, with levels up to J=20 included. Collision coefficients are from [\citet=GC78]. A range of densities, nH2 = 102-106 ~ cm- 3, and kinetic temperatures, Tk = 0-100 K, was explored. HC3N column densities based on LTE excitation (Table [\ref=Trat]), are calculated at 2'' resolution from:

[formula]

using molecular data of [\citet=LL78], HC3N(5-4) intensities, and Tex(HC3N) from Table [\ref=Trat]. HC3N abundances are found to be, X(HC3N)≃10- 9.1 ~  -  ~ 10- 8.5, with the highest values towards C1 and D. While uncertain these abundances agree with those found in [\citet=MT05] and are typical of Galactic center HC3N abundances [\citep=MTPZ76] [\citep=DMNC00] and good enough for constraining X / dv / dr. The ratio of cloud linewidth to core size is ~   ~ 1 - 3 ~ km ~ s- 1pc- 1 for the GMCs. Therefore, we adopt a standard model abundance per velocity gradient of X / dv / dr = 10- 9 km s- 1, but run models for values of X / dv / dr ~ 10- 11 - 10- 9.

Antenna temperatures are sensitive to the unknown filling factor. In these extragalactic observations, the beam corresponds to scales large compared to cloud structure, and hence filling factors are not directly known. To first order, the line ratios, R10 / 5 and R16 / 5 are independent of filling factor if we assume that HC3N(5-4), (10-9) and (16-15) originate in the same gas. So model ratios are compared to the observed data to constrain parameter space. For the parameter space implied by the line ratios model brightness temperatures are determined. A comparison of the model brightness temperature to the observed brightness temperature sets the required areal filling factors for that solution.

Physical Conditions of the Dense Component

Figure [\ref=lvg] displays the results of the LVG modeling. Acceptable [formula] (Tk,nH2) parameter spaces are shown for each line ratio (R10 / 5, thick solid gray line; R16 / 5, thick solid black line). Also shown in Figure [\ref=lvg] are the acceptable solutions obtained from the C18O(2-1)/C18O(1-0) line ratio [\citep=MT01]. Figure [\ref=levels] and Table [\ref=Tlvg1] display the model flux versus upper J state of the line for the TK = 10 K, 30 K and 50 K solutions (also 70 K solutions for GMC B).

HC3N(5-4) has a critical density of ncr  ~  5  ×  104 cm- 3 and an upper energy state of 6.55 K. HC3N(16-15) has a critical density, [formula] cm- 3 and an upper energy state of 59 K. HC3N(10-9) values are intermediate. Therefore R10 / 5 and R16 / 5 are sensitive probes of nH2 between the range of 104 and 106 cm- 3. Observed ratios constrain nH2 to ~    ±  0.1 dex at a given Tk and to ~    ±  0.3 dex for all modeled Tk  >  20 K. For Tk  ~   40 K, ratios are largely insensitive to Tk (curves are horizontal). The LVG models do not constrain density when Tk is low. Thus to narrow the range of possible solutions requires two or more line ratios, or an external constraint on one of the axes. Kinetic temperatures of the dense component at 2'' scales in IC 342 remain largely unconstrained to date. One method of constraining the kinetic temperature is the peak Tb at this resolution of the optically thick CO(2-1) line. Using this method, Tk  ~  ≃ 35-45 K towards GMCs A, B and C, and Tk  ~  ≃ 15-20 K for GMCs D, D and E [\citep=THH93] [\citep=SBM03]. These values are not highly discordant from arcminute resolution T[formula] K measurements from NH3 HMR82 or the far-infrared dust temperature of 42 - 55 K [\citep=BGMNSWW80] [\citep=RH84]. However, the CO(2-1) traces gas with densities two to three orders of magnitude lower than these HC3N transitions, so it is not clear that this is the relevant Tk for the dense cores of the GMCs.

Valid solutions are found for the GMCs, with the exception of GMC D', which is the most uncertain due to its distance from the center of the field. (No fit is attempted for GMC D because both HC3N(5-4) and HC3N(16-15) are upper limits or tentative detections.) The solutions show modest cloud excitations given the strong nuclear star formation. Good agreement is observed between solutions found using R16 / 5 and R10 / 5 when kinetic temperatures are low (Tk ~  < 30 K). Given uncertainties in line intensities and X(HC3N) / dv / dr, higher temperatures cannot be ruled out. While Tk itself is less well constrained the combination nH2Tk is well determined. Since line brightnesses are the measured quantity, as gas temperatures are raised, densities or filling factors must decrease to compensate. The nature of the solutions are such that the densities decrease more than the filling factors (Table [\ref=lvg]).

GMCs A, C1 and C3 are best fit with nH2  ~  104.7 - 5.2 cm- 3 and Tk  ~  ≃ 20 K. For Tk  =  50 K derived densities drop to nH2  ~  104.3  -  4.7 cm- 3, while they drop to nH2  ~  103.7  -  4.4 cm- 3 for Tk = 100 K. Changes in X / dv / dr do not strongly influence the derived solutions. Towards these clouds filling factors are fa≃0.03 - 0.1. For comparison, a 1 pc2 cloud would have fa  ~  ≃ 0.0012 for the aperture size and IC 342's distance. Therefore these GMCs appear to have a few dozen dense clumps similar to the larger clumps found in Galactic GMCs [\citep=MB83] [\citep=ZPT98]. GMC C2 appears to have similar densities but slightly elevated temperatures, Tk  ~  ≃ 30K. In GMCs D and D' densities are at least a factor of four lower than the other clouds. Little can be said about the kinetic temperatures of these GMCs. GMC D' is the only location with statistically discrepant solutions from R10 / 5 and R16 / 5. Here the (16-15) line is somewhat brighter than would be expected from the R10 / 5.

The starburst GMC, B, is markedly different from the others. The combination of a low absolute HC3N brightness temperature and high ratios, R10 / 5 and R16 / 5, require higher densities of nH2105 cm- 3 and a smaller (fa  <  0.02) filling factor. Both line ratios seem to indicate a kinetic temperature of more than Tk  ~  ≃ 40 K, and perhaps significantly higher, averaged over our 30 pc beam. The dense gas in GMC B, which is closest to the active star-forming region and IR source, is more compact, denser, and more highly excited than the other clouds.

For our own Galactic Center it has long been argued that molecular clouds must be unusually dense, at least n  ~  104  ~  cm- 3 to withstand tidal forces [\citep=stark89]. If one assumes that GMC C, the most well defined cloud, is a point mass in a spherical mass potential of the galaxy, its Roche limit would be at a radius of 25 pc. The radius of the combined C1-C2-C3 complex is >  25 pc. In IC 342, the proximity to the nucleus where the strong noncircular velocity field [\citep=TH92] together with feedback from the starburst [\citep=SBMC08] suggests that these clumps have densities large enough to maintain their identity but likely will not remain gravitationally bound to each other.

Comparisons Between HC3N and C18O Physical Conditions

For all GMCs (including GMC B), Tex(HC3N) ≃ Tex(C18O). If a model in which all the H2 exists in one uniform component, then the similarity of Tex from both HC3N and C18O implies that the densities of the molecular clouds are high enough (> 104.5 cm- 3) to thermalize both C18O and HC3N across the nucleus. (LVG solutions for C18O J=2-1 and 1-0 lines from [\citet=MT01] are shown with the HC3N solutions in Figure [\ref=lvg].) In this monolithic model the low observed Tex of 10-20 K demand that the thermalized clouds must be quite cool. These temperatures are similar to those of dark clouds in the disk of our Galaxy, which is somewhat surprising given the elevated star formation rate in the nucleus of IC 342.

However this model of a monolithic, dense, cold ISM seen in both HC3N and C18O runs into problems with total mass constraints. If the ISM is uniformly this dense and cold then the total dense gas cloud mass implied by the required densities and filling factors become very large, greater than permitted based on the optically thin C18O line emission. In Table [\ref=Tlvg1] the total mass of dense gas, Mden, is approximated from the LVG solutions assuming Mden  =  mH2nH2R3, with R defined as [formula]. Table [\ref=Trat] lists the total molecular gas mass, MH2, estimated from C18O(2-1) data [\citep=MT01] assuming MH2  =  mH2NH2Abeam. One can see that Mden is typically larger than MH2 for Tk ~  <  30 K and diverges rapidly as Tk drops towards the LVG favored values. In short if GMCs have uniformly such high densities and cold temperatures then the clouds would contain too much H2 mass for what is observed in C18O. To match the line ratios while not violating mass constraints requires a multi-component dense ISM. A possible two component model of the dense gas is discussed in § [\ref=cloudsxco].

Dense Gas and the CO Conversion Factor

A consideration of the conversion factor between CO intensity and H2 column density, XCO, in the nuclear region of IC 342 suggests that the model of a single, high density and relatively cool ISM is not consistent with observations of CO isotopologues. Moreover these clouds are unlikely to resemble Galactic disk GMCs in their internal structure and dynamics.

The Single Component Model and XCO

The well known Galactic relation between CO intensity and H2 column density, XCO ~  =  ~ ICO / N(H2), can be explained if GMCs consist of optically thick (in CO) turbulent clumps in virial equilibrium [\citep=L81] [\citep=SSBY87] [\citep=SS87]. For the clumps to emit in HC3N densities must be large enough so that Tb can legitimately be approximated by Tk. If we adopt this model, then XCO is approximated by:

[formula]

where φ is the volume filling factor and cln is the density of the clumps [\citep=S96] [\citep=MB88]. From the brightness of the CO isotopic lines, COfa  ~  1 on 2arcsec scales [\citep=MT01]. The conversion factor XCO within the central few hundred pc of IC 342 has been determined to be 0.6  ×  1020  ~  cm- 2  (K ~ km  s- 1)- 1 [\citep=MT01]. If the monolithic model presented in the previous section is correct and clouds are virialized clumps in equilibrium, then [formula] must be [formula]0.75 to match the observed conversion factor.

Table [\ref=Tlvg1] records [formula] for each of the LVG solutions across the nucleus of IC 342. For all solutions, [formula] is greater than the required value, especially at low Tk. For the single component LVG favored Tk of ~  10 - 20 K towards the more quiescent clouds, [formula]5-75, implying IC342XCO should be several times larger than MWXCO. However XCO in the nucleus of IC 342 is 3-4 times lower than the Galactic conversion factor, based on both optically thin isotopologues of CO as well as dust emission [\citep=MT01]. Lower conversion factors appear to be the norm for the nuclei of gas-rich star forming galaxies, including our own [\citep=SBMPN91] [\citep=SYB97] [\citep=DHWM98] [\citep=HHR99] [\citep=MT04] [\citep=MTH08]. In the nuclear region of IC 342 dense gas kinetic temperatures do not appear to be higher than the Galactic disk value by an amount large enough to offset the observed increase in density over typical Galactic disk-like clouds; Tk  >  100 K would be required. Recently [\citet=W07] completed a more generalized treatment of the conversion factor including radiative transfer and concludes that the true exponential dependences of nH2 and Tk are weaker than 0.5 and -1, respectively. However in all cases modelled, the dependences remain positive for nH2 and negative for Tk.

In summary, it is not possible to reconcile bright HC3N emission from uniformly cool, dense gas (low Tk, high nH2 and high fa) with the known total amount of H2 present if virialized constant density clumps are adopted.

A Possible Two Component Model and XCO

The lack of an apparent connection between [formula] of the dense component and the observed conversion factor indicates that the clouds in the nucleus of IC 342 cannot be treated as simple virialized collections of uniform density clumps. One might expect that a large fraction of the C18O emission could originate from a moderate density component that is distinct from the denser, HC3N-emitting gas. (Note that 12CO traces a distinct component more diffuse than that traced both by C18O [\citep=MTH00] and HC3N.)

As a first order extension to the basic virialized clumps model, we imagine two spatially well-mixed sets of clumps; one low density C18O emitting, nl, and one high density, nh, that emits both C18O and HC3N. Assuming the fraction, by number, of clumps with high density is Γ, then if both clumps have the same Tk the virialized clumps XCO relation becomes:

[formula]

where ñ ~  =   ~  (1  -  Γ)nl  +  Γnh. The ratio of dense gas to total H2 becomes, Mden/Mtot  ~  ≃Γnh / ((1 - Γ)nl  +  Γnh) = Γnh  /  ñ. For a given Tk, nl is chosen to match the C18O LVG solution [\citep=MT01], while nh is chosen to match the HC3N LVG solutions, and Γ ~  =  ~ φHC3N  /  φCO≃f3 / 2a. Table [\ref=Tlvg2] displays the adopted C18O LVG solutions, along with the new [formula] and Mden/Mtot for the two component model, assuming, for simplicity, that Tk is the same for both components. [formula] and hence XCO are decreased from the simple one component model by factors of at least four. This simple extension results in closer agreement between the observed and calculated values of XCO (especially when including the somewhat super-virial line widths), while maintaining most of the mass in the dense (low filling factor) component.

It is almost certainly the case that this extension is an oversimplification. In reality, we expect the clouds to exhibit a continuum of densities. However the LVG modeling demonstrates that at least these three components are required to match the multi-transition observations of 12CO, 13CO, C18O and HC3N. This is consistent with conclusions from recent single-dish modeling of higher J transitions of HC3N [\citep=AMMMB11], but we find multiple components are required to match intensities not only between GMCs but within individual GMCs.

HC3N Emitting Dense Gas and Star Formation

HC3N versus HCN(1-0)

HCN(1-0) emission is the workhorse for relating quantities of dense gas to star formation [\citep=GS04]. It is interesting to compare conclusions about the dense component from HC3N with those of the more commonly used HCN(1-0). HCN(1-0) has been mapped at similar spatial resolution by [\citet=DRGGGM92]. Figure [\ref=inticont] compares HC3N(5-4) to HCN(1-0). While HC3N generally traces the same dense GMCs seen in HCN their relative brightnesses are rather different. In HCN(1-0) GMC A, B and C are all within 10 % of the same brightness and GMCs D and E are 100 % and 50 % weaker, respectively. Whereas in HC3N(5-4) and (16-15), C dominates, B is nearly absent and A is not significantly different from D and E. Comparisons with HC3N clearly demonstrate that there is larger variations in dense gas properties than HCN indicates. The dominate difference is enhanced HCN towards the starburst and GMC A relative to GMC C. Unlike the HC3N transitions, HCN(1-0) is optically thick and has slightly larger (25 - 50 %) filling factors [\citep=DRGGGM92]. As kinetic temperatures increase optically thick transitions brighten more rapidly than (lower excitation) optically thin transitions. Hence it is expected that the HCN emission should favor somewhat warmer dense gas. Likely this effect results in the much brighter relative HCN(1-0) intensities towards the starburst. The relative enhancement towards GMC A is less clear. However, this cloud is known to be dominated by PDRs [\citep=MT05], strongly influenced by mechanical feedback from the nuclear cluster [\citep=SBMC08] and has a complicated HC3N temperature and velocity structure (Sections [\ref=morp] and [\ref=ratio]). This cloud must have a complex density and temperature structure, potentially with a warmer intermediate density medium (Table [\ref=Trat]). Moreover, HCN abundances can be elevated in PDRs.

We conclude that while HCN(1-0) does a good job locating the dense gas but it does a poorer job tracing small scale variation in the properties of the dense gas when a mix of strong star formation and quiescent gas are present. It is expected that such effects should become more important as specific star formation rates increase and spatial scales decrease.

HC3N versus Star Formation

The brightest HC3N emission and the brightest star-forming regions do not coincide. Most of the current star formation, traced by bright infrared and thermal radio continuum emission [\citep=BGMNSWW80] [\citep=TH83], is situated about 50 pc to the southwest of the dynamical center, in the vicinity of GMC B. The brightest HC3N emission by far is on the northeast side of the nucleus, in the northern molecular arm centered at GMC C2. This region has free-free emission amounting to only a third of the brightness of the strongest radio source, associated with GMC B. The faintness, in absolute terms, of HC3N(16-15) towards GMC B is unexpected and important reflecting a much lower areal filling of warm, very dense gas here. Either the number of cloud clumps or their size is small relative to the other GMCs.

On the other hand, the excitation of HC3N does reflect the presence of young forming stars. HC3N(16-15) and HC3N(10-9) are relatively brighter towards the current starburst. This suggests that the absence of a correlation between HC3N(5-4) intensity and star formation is partly due to depopulation of the lower energy transitions. GMCs that are faint in the HC3N J=16-15 transition and not associated with strong star formation show up well at the lower J transitions of HC3N, as would be expected for gas of lower excitation. Clearly there is a large amount of dense gas currently not actively forming stars, that shows up in the low excitation transitions of HC3N. This is consistent with the fact that both HNC(1-0) and N2H+(1-0), generally considered dense quiescent gas tracers, are found to be very bright towards IC 342's nucleus [\citep=MT05]. HC3N(5-4) appears to be an excellent extragalactic probe of the dense, quiescent molecular gas component not yet involved in the current starburst.

To quantitatively compare star formation with dense gas, a star formation rate is derived from the 45 GHz continuum flux (spectral indices measured between 2 cm and 7 mm demonstrate that the vast majority of flux toward GMCs B and C is thermal Bremsstrahlung). The star formation rate is then compared with Mden (Table [\ref=Tlvg2]) to estimate a dense gas star formation efficiency, SFE[formula]. Dense gas depletion timescales, τden= 1/SFEden, are also computed. In Table [\ref=Tlvg2] the ratio of the observed Lyman continuum ionization rate [\citep=MT01] [\citep=TTBCHM06] to Mden derived from the LVG analysis is reported. Towards the non-starburst GMCs [formula], while towards GMC B this ratio is 10 - 30 times larger. If one adopts the conversion from NLyc to star formation rate of [formula] [\citep=K98], then SFEden for the starburst is [formula], or dense gas depletion times of τden≃ 2-3 Myr! This highly enhanced SFEden is a direct consequence of the faint HC3N emission here. Even towards the non-starburst clouds SFEden are 1.6  -  4.0  ×  10- 8 yr- 1. These efficiencies are sufficiently short that they imply dense gas consumption timescales that are non-negligible fractions of the expected GMC lifetimes.

The dense SFE is rather high across the nucleus, but the extreme value towards GMC B is remarkable. [\citet=MT01] argued that intense star formation is suppressed along the spiral arms being triggered when the inflowing molecular gas collides with the inner ring molecular gas. Therefore it is reasonable that in a relative sense SFEden is lower away from the central ring. However this leaves unexplained why GMC B's SFEden is so much larger than GMC C, though its positions at the arm / inner ring intersection is the same. We suggest this is a sign of the evolution of star formation across the nucleus that is impacted by radiative and mechanical feed-back from within the molecular cloud.

Destruction / Dispersal of Dense Gas with Starburst Age

A possible cause of the different SFEden between GMC C and B is that we are observing the clouds at high enough spatial resolution to begin to identify the changing internal structure of the clouds in the presence of the starburst. Over the lifetime of a cloud SFEs vary. In the earliest stages of a star formation episode SFEs will appear low because elevated star formation rates have yet to convert the bulk of the molecular material to stars. Towards the final stages of a GMCs evolution instantaneous SFEs appear to increase dramatically as the cloud clumps are consumed, destroyed or dispersed. So observed instantaneous SFEs are expected to vary widely throughout the lifetime of an individual GMC and relative to lifetime averaged SFEs typically considered in extragalactic studies.

If starburst B is a few Myrs more evolved than the other GMCs, especially the dynamical similar C, then we may be witnessing the consumption, dispersal or destruction phase of the remaining dense clumps in the presence of the expanding HII region. The magnitude of the dense gas consumption times for B are indeed shorter than the lifetime of the GMC. Several lines of evidence suggest that the (weaker) star formation towards C2 may be at a somewhat earlier phase. These include less extended HII regions [\cite=TTBCHM06], bright hot core-like species CH3OH [\citep=MT05], NH3(6,6) [\citep=MHH06] and CO(6-5) [\citep=HHSGRG91], and more mm dust continuum emission [\citep=MT01].

In this context it is interesting to compare the thermal pressure of the starburst HII region with that of the dense clumps along the same line of sight. Assuming a Strömgren sphere of R~  3 pc, NLyc  =  1.1  ×  1051 s- 1 and Te = 8000 K, parameters determined for the main starburst HII [\citep=TTBCHM06], the thermal pressure of such an HII region would be neTe = 106.76 cm- 3 K. This value is equal given the uncertainties to nH2TK≃106.57 - 6.75 cm- 3 K for the dense component of GMC B, hinting at pressure balance between the dense clumps and the HII region. In addition, the filling factor of the HII region is larger than implied by the HC3N LVG analysis. So it is possible that HC3N emission towards GMC B comes from dense clumps embedded within the HII region.

The above analysis suggests the following physical picture for the faint HC3N emission towards the starburst. The starburst towards B is more evolved. The HII region at GMC B has had time to expand, destroying or dispersing the dense gas, which is now in the form of smaller clumps and/or more diffuse gas. Clumps that remain there must have high pressure to survive. Near the younger star forming cloud GMC C (particularly toward GMC C2), the HII regions may just be developing, and have not had time to disperse the clouds. The dense clumps here would be more abundant and still present a hot core-like chemistry. The clouds further from the central are on average less dense and at the current epoch remain largely quiescent, except possibly D', where the second high excitation component could be associated with the presence of shocks [\citep=MT05].

Conclusions

We have imaged the HC3N J=5-4 line in the nucleus of IC 342 with the VLA and the HC3N(16-15) line with the PdBI at 2arcsec resolution. These are the first maps of these transitions in an external galaxy. We have detected emission extended along the nuclear "mini-spiral" in (5-4) and more concentrated emission in (16-15), with relative abundance of X(HC3N)  ~    ~    ~  1  ×  10- 9. HC3N emission is not tightly correlated with star formation strength. Dense gas excitation however, follows star formation more closely. GMC B, which is weak in all the HC3N lines, is relatively stronger in the higher J lines.

LVG modeling indicates that the HC3N-emitting gas has densities of 104 - 5  ~  cm- 3. In IC 342, physical conditions of the densest component are fairly constant away from the immediate environment of the starburst, though beyond the central ring densities begin to fall. Comparison with the C18O observations of [\citet=MT01] reveal excitation temperatures similar to C18O values indicating either that the molecular gas is dense and cool (Tk ~  < 20 K) or that there are multiple gas components where the densities and kinetic temperatures of each component conspire to give similar overall excitation. The strong over-prediction of the amount of gas mass present if densities are large and temperatures cool, favors a multi-component ISM with at least two components beside the diffuse one seen in 12CO(2-1). The actual ISM is likely a continuum of cloud densities with different densities dominating different tracers. HC3N also differs in morphology from HCN(1-0), with HCN(1-0) being much brighter towards the starburst. This is further evidence that there are multiple dense gas components.

Of particular interest, the starburst site (GMC B) exhibits the largest difference in intensity between HC3N (both transitions) and HCN(1-0). The faintness of the HC3N here suggests that the brightness of HCN(1-0) is not due solely to large quantities of dense gas. A comparison between the GMCs with the largest star formation rates and similar dynamical environments, B and C, hint at an explanation. While GMC B shows higher excitation, the low brightness of this cloud indicates that it is composed of a relatively small amount of warm, dense clumps. The smaller amount of dense gas at the site of the strongest young star formation indicate high star formation efficiencies in the dense gas. Towards GMC C, HC3N, CH3OH and NH3 are more intense and the fraction of millimeter continuum from dust is higher. This indicates that GMC C is in an early, less evolved (hot core-like) state. The extreme dense gas star formation efficiency observed towards GMC B reflects the fact the main burst is in a more evolved state. The dense clumps towards the starburst are being dispersed or destroyed in the presence of the HII region. The little dense gas remaining appears to be in pressure equilibrium with the HII region. The larger opacity of HCN(1-0) relative to HC3N elevates its brightness temperature in this warm gas and lowers its critical density permitting it to remain excited in the somewhat lower density component.

We conclude that EVLA observations of HC3N(5-4) can be a powerful probe of dense, quiescent molecular gas in galaxies, and when combined with high resolution imaging of the higher J transitions of HC3N with current and upcoming mm interferometers (like ALMA) provide tight constraints on dense molecular gas properties in stronger or more widespread starbursts, where changes like those localized to GMC B are expected to permeate much of the ISM.
