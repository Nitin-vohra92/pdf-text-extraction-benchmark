Proper holomorphic mappings between hyperbolic product manifolds

Introduction

A natural problem in the study of holomorphic mappings is to give a description of the automorphism group or the set of all proper holomorphic self-maps of a given complex space. Of course, this problem is intractable in general even when posed for arbitrary domains in [formula]. One of the simplest classes of domains in [formula] is the class of products of planar domains. The following theorem due to Remmert and Stein gives the precise structure of a proper holomorphic map between certain product domains.

The proof of this result in the case n = 2 was given by Remmert and Stein (Satz 12 in [\cite=remmert1960eha]). Their proof uses Rado's theorem. The proof of the general case requires a generalization of Rado's theorem, but all other aspects of Remmert and Stein's proof remain unchanged. For a proof of the above result and other related results, refer to [\cite=narasimhan1971scv].

Another result on the theme of mappings between product spaces is the following theorem of Peters which generalizes a well-known result by Cartan [\cite=cartan1936domainesBornes]:

Here [formula] denotes the connected component of the identity element of [formula].

To the best of our knowledge, there is no analogue of the above result for proper holomorphic maps in the literature, except for Result [\ref=RES:RS] (and a small technical improvement thereof in [\cite=narasimhan1971scv]). One would have expected a similar result with the planar domains of Result [\ref=RES:RS] replaced by hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. However, it is far from clear whether the methods seen in the proofs of either of the above results are alone decisive in proving the hoped-for generalization. In our view, in addition to the Remmert-Stein method, the key ingredient needed is the phenomenon illustrated by the following example.

Let [formula], and f = (f1,f2) be a proper holomorphic self-map of D  ×  D. Note that D is hyperbolic. Even though most of the hypotheses of the Remmert-Stein theorem are not satisfied, the conclusion still follows.

This is not hard to see. Fix [formula]. By the big Picard theorem, it follows that 0,1 and ∞   are removable singularities or poles of the map [formula]. Hence h extends as a holomorphic map to [formula], and is therefore a rational map. If h is not proper as a map from [formula] to itself, then there is a sequence [formula] that converges to either 0,1 or ∞  , such that some subsequence of the image sequence {h(xn)} converges to a finite point in [formula]. Hence h is a rational map that misses at least one of the points 0,1 or ∞  , and must therefore be constant.

On the other hand, assume that h is a proper map from [formula] to itself; then it is a non-constant rational map. Thus, if [formula], where P and Q are two polynomials having no common factors, at least one of P or Q has to be non-constant. Also, note that h takes {0,1,  ∞  } to itself.

If P were non-linear, it would follow that either Q has the same degree as P, or Q is some constant C. In the latter case, both P and P  -  Q are non-constant polynomials with disjoint zero sets. From this, it follows that P is either zk or (z - 1)k, k  >  1. Therefore, the equation h  =  1 has roots different from 0 and 1, which is a contradiction. If P and Q have the same degree, then it follows that [formula] is of the form Rk, where R is a non-constant rational function, and the value 1 is attained by k distinct values, which is also a contradiction. Hence P is linear, and a similar argument shows that Q is also linear. Hence h is a fractional linear transformation that takes {0,1,  ∞  } to itself. There are only six possibilities for the map h. From this it follows that, if for some z0, [formula] is an automorphism, then [formula] is the same automorphism for all [formula] (see Lemma [\ref=LEM:CPT]). Together with the conclusion of the first paragraph, this proves that [formula] is either constant for all z, or is independent of z. Applying the same argument to f2, we conclude that the conclusion of the Remmert-Stein theorem still holds.

The key fact used in the above example is that there are only finitely many proper holomorphic self-maps of [formula]. This is not true for the domains [formula] and [formula]. We are motivated by all of this to generalize the result of Remmert and Stein to complex manifolds that are products of certain hyperbolic Riemann surfaces.

Let Rj and Sj, [formula], be compact Riemann surfaces, and let Xj (resp. Yj) be a connected, hyperbolic open subset of Rj (resp. Sj) for each [formula]. Let [formula] be a finite proper holomorphic map. Then, denoting [formula] as [formula], each Fi is of the form Fi(zπ(i)), where π is a permutation of [formula].

It is essential for F to be a finite map in the above theorem. Without this requirement, Theorem [\ref=THM:MAIN] is false. To see this, let X be some compact hyperbolic Riemann surface. The map F:X2  →  X2 defined by F(z1,z2): = (z1,z1) is a proper map. In fact, F satisfies all the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=THM:MAIN] except finiteness.

The conclusion of the above theorem can fail if even one of the factors is non-hyperbolic. Consider [formula], where p∈ and [formula] denotes the unit disc in [formula]. We know that [formula] is not hyperbolic. We view [formula] as [formula]. It is easy to check that any [formula] is of the form where [formula] and A is non-vanishing.

The novelty of our proof, from the viewpoint of function theory, lies in our use of the fact that the set of non-constant holomorphic maps between certain Riemann surfaces is at most finite. This pheneomenon is well understood in the realm of compact complex manifolds; see, for instance, [\cite=kobayashi1998hyperbolic]. However, the factors Xj and Yj in Theorem [\ref=THM:MAIN] are not necessarily compact. We will see that the main idea in the Remmert-Stein theorem (i.e. Result [\ref=RES:RS]) is still useful in our more general setting. Loosely speaking, we show that, in general, the manifold [formula] splits into two factors, one of which is the product of those non-compact factors to which the Remmert-Stein method can be applied. The finiteness result that is essential to our proof is a result by Imayoshi [\cite=imayoshi1983generalizations]. This result, plus some other technical necessities are stated in Section [\ref=SEC:RES]. The proof of Theorem [\ref=THM:MAIN] is presented in Section [\ref=SEC:PROOF].

A version of Montel's Theorem

In the proof of our main result, we need a version of Montel's theorem that is adapted to our situation. The proof of this version requires some general results about normal families. We state these results, with references, in this section. Throughout this section, M and N will denote complex manifolds, and O(M,N) will denote the space of holomorphic maps from M into N. We give O(M,N) the compact-open topology. We begin with the definition of a normal family.

A subset F of O(M,N) is said to be normal if every sequence of F contains a subsequence {fn} that is either convergent in O(M,N), or is compactly divergent. By the latter we mean that given compact sets K  ⊆  M and H  ⊆  N, [formula] for all sufficiently large n.

We now state and prove the version of Montel's Theorem that we need, which is a corollary of the last two results.

Let X be a connected complex manifold and let R be a hyperbolic open connected subset of a compact Riemann surface S. Then, given any sequence {fν}  ⊂  O(X,R), there exists a subsequence {fνk} and a holomorphic map [formula] (the closure taken in S whenever R is non-compact) such that fνk  →  f0 uniformly on compact subsets of X.

We begin by noting that if R is compact, then the result follows immediately from Results [\ref=RES:HYP] and [\ref=RES:TAUT].

We now consider the case when R is a punctured Riemann surface. By Result [\ref=RES:TAUT], O(X,R) is a normal family. There is nothing to prove if there exists a subsequence {fνk} that converges uniformly on compact subsets of X. Therefore, let us consider the case when we get only a compactly divergent subsequence {fνk}. Let [formula] be an exhaustion of X by connected compact subsets, and let [formula] be an exhaustion of R by compact subsets. Since R is obtained from S by deleting finitely many points from it, compact divergence implies that we can extract a further subsequence from {fνk} -- which we shall re-index again as {fνk} -- such that [formula], where D* is a deleted neighbourhood of one of the punctures, say p0. Now, given any [formula], there exists a [formula] such that, by the connectedness of the Kj's, we have:

[formula]

This just means that fνk  →  p0 uniformly on compacts as k  →    ∞  .

In the general case, as R is hyperbolic, we can make sufficiently many punctures in S to get a Riemann surface R' that is hyperbolic and R  ⊆  R'  ⊂  S . By considering each fν as a mapping in O(X,R'), we can find, by the preceding argument, a subsequence {fνk} and a holomorphic map [formula] such that fνk  →  f0 uniformly on compact subsets of X. As each fνk∈O(X,R), we must have [formula], and we are done.

Some technical necessities

In this section we summarize several results that we need for the proof of Theorem [\ref=THM:MAIN]. We state these results with appropriate references. We begin with an extension of a classical result due to de Franchis [\cite=de1913teorema], which states that there are at most finitely many non-constant holomorphic mappings between two compact hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. We shall call a Riemann surface obtained by removing a finite, non-empty set of points from some compact Riemann surface a punctured Riemann surface. A Riemann surface obtained by removing n points from a compact Riemann surface of genus g will be called a Riemann surface of finite type (g,n). Imayoshi extended de Franchis' result as follows:

The above result combined with the following lemma will play a key role in the proof of the main theorem. To state this lemma, we need a definition.

Let F:X  →  Y be a map between two sets, and suppose that [formula]. We say that F is independent of Xj if, for each fixed [formula], x0i∈Xi, the map is a constant map. We say that F varies along Xj if F is not independent of Xj.

Let R and S be as in Result [\ref=RES:FRANCHIS], and let X be a connected complex manifold. Let F:R  ×  X  →  S be a holomorphic mapping with the property that for some x0∈X, the mapping R∋z  ↦  F(z,x0)∈S is a non-constant mapping. Then F is independent of X.

Let dR and dS be metrics that induce the topology of R and S, respectively. By Result [\ref=RES:FRANCHIS], the set of non-constant holomorphic mappings from R to S is at most finite. By our hypotheses, there is at least one such map. Let [formula] be the only distinct non-constant mappings in O(R,S). Let x0∈X be such that the map [formula] is non-constant. By continuity of F, there is an X-open neighbourhood U0∋x0 such that [formula] is non-constant for x∈U0. Choose ε  >  0 and rij∈R, 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  k, i  ≠  j, such that dS(Fi(rij),Fj(rij))  >  ε. By the continuity of F, we can find a neighbourhood U  ⊂  U0 of x0 such that, for each of the rij's, we have [formula]. This is possible only if [formula]. It follows that

[formula] such that [formula];

For each fixed r∈R, the map [formula] is constant on U.

As X is connected, the Identity Theorem implies that [formula]. This proves that F is independent of X.

The next result is the well known Remmert's Proper Mapping Theorem. For the proof, refer to [\cite=chirka1989complex].

The following result due to Kobayashi [\cite=kobayashi1998hyperbolic] can be thought of as an higher dimensional analogue of the big Picard theorem. For this, we first need to make a definition.

Let Z be a complex manifold and let Y be a relatively compact complex submanifold of Z. We call a point [formula] a hyperbolic point if every neighbourhood U of p contains a smaller neighbourhood V of [formula], such that

[formula]

where KY denotes the Kobayashi pseudo-distance on Y. We say that Y is hyperbolically imbedded in Z if every point of [formula] is a hyperbolic point.

If Y is a hyperbolic open connected subset of a compact Riemann surface Z, then Y is hyperbolically imbedded in Z.

The lemma is obvious if Y has only isolated boundary points. If not, then, as Y is hyperbolic, we can make sufficiently many punctures in Z to get a hyperbolic Riemann surface [formula] such that [formula]. It follows that [formula] is hyperbolically imbedded in Z. Now let [formula]. Then, [formula]. Let U be a neighbourhood of y, and let V be a smaller neighbourhood of y such that

[formula]

As [formula] on Y  ×  Y and [formula], it follows that y is also a hyperbolic point of Y. Consequently, Y is hyperbolically imbedded in Z.

We require one more result, a generalization of Rado's theorem that is proved in [\cite=narasimhan1971scv].

Let (φμν), 1  ≤  μ  ≤  k, 1  ≤  ν  ≤  l, be a matrix of holomorphic functions on D  ⊆  U, where D and U are connected open subsets of [formula], and [formula] is a non-empty indiscrete set. Suppose that

[formula]

for any [formula]. Then, for some ν0, 1  ≤  ν0  ≤  l, we have

[formula]

Suppose each column of (φμν) has a member that is not identically 0 on D. Let f be the product of these members. We extend f to be a function on U by defining [formula] on [formula]. By hypothesis, f is continuous on U and holomorphic on D. Therefore by the classical Rado's theorem [formula], a contradiction.

Proof of the main theorem

We begin this section by considering a special case of Theorem [\ref=THM:MAIN] whose proof contains some technicalities. Since these technicalities would lengthen the proof of Theorem [\ref=THM:MAIN] if we were to embark on it directly, we shall isolate the technical portion of our proof in the following proposition. Its proof consists of rephrasing the Remmert-Stein argument relative to a coordinate patch; see [\cite=narasimhan1971scv]. We shall therefore be brief and explain in detail only those points that differ from the proof in [\cite=narasimhan1971scv].

Let [formula] and [formula], be complex manifolds. Assume that each Xj and each Yj satisfy the hypothesis of Theorem [\ref=THM:MAIN] and that Y is non-compact. Further assume that, for each j, [formula] is a non-empty indiscrete set. Let F:X  →  Y be a finite proper holomorphic map. Then, denoting [formula] as [formula], each Fi is of the form Fi(zπ(i)), where π is a permutation of [formula].

In particular, if there is a mapping with the above properties from X to Y, then Y cannot have any compact factors.

For 1  ≤  j  ≤  n, let Rj and Sj be as in Theorem [\ref=THM:MAIN]. Let [formula] be a point in [formula] such that, for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, pi is a limit point of the set [formula] and belongs to ∂Xi.

Let (Uk,ψk) be connected holomorphic co-ordinate charts of Rk, chosen in such a way that pi∈Ui and the image of [formula] under each Fj lies in some holomorphic co-ordinate chart (Vj,ρj) of Sj. Let Wi be a connected component of [formula] such that pi∈∂Wi. For [formula], let In view of Corollary [\ref=COR:MONTEL], we can rephrase the arguments in [\cite=narasimhan1971scv] to conclude:

[formula]

where ζ is any arbitrary point in ψi(∂Wi). Let us take D  =  ψi(Wi) and U  =  ψi(Ui) in Lemma [\ref=RES:RADO]. Note that [formula], whence [formula] is indiscrete. Thus, we have that for each [formula], there is a j  =  j(z) such that is zero [formula]. At this point, we can again argue exactly as in [\cite=narasimhan1971scv] to conclude that there exists an integer σ(i),1  ≤  σ(i)  ≤  n, such that

[formula]

Therefore on [formula] is independent of [formula]. By applying the Identity Theorem, we conclude that Fσ(i) is independent of the same variables on X. By Remmert's Proper Mapping Theorem, F is surjective. This implies that Fσ(i) varies along Xi. Since the choice of 1  ≤  i  ≤  n in the preceding argument was arbitrary, for each i there exists precisely one σ(i) such that [formula]. The permutation π  =  σ- 1, and we are done with the proof of the first part.

To establish the final part of this result, assume that [formula] are all compact, for some s  <  n. Fix an i as in the previous paragraph. The heart of the argument above, see [\cite=narasimhan1971scv], consists of using Montel's theorem (Corollary [\ref=COR:MONTEL] in our present set-up) to construct a map [formula], where [formula]. Set Ej: = {z∈Z:φj(z)∈∂Yj}. Clearly :

[formula]

In view of ([\ref=EQ:1]), the argument in [\cite=narasimhan1971scv] reveals that, for each [formula]. Since s  <  n, by assumption, there would exist i  ≠  i' such that σ(i)  =  σ(i'). But this would contradict the surjectivity of F, and we are done.
