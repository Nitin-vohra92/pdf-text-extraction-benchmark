Two-electron effects pervading the formation of highly excited neutral atoms in the break-up of strongly driven H2

A wealth of physical phenomena is manifested during fragmentation of molecules driven by intense infrared laser fields. In the case of H2--the most fundamental diatomic molecule--such phenomena include, for instance, non-sequential double ionization (NSDI) [\cite=Alnaser] [\cite=Niikura] with the re-collision (three-step) model [\cite=Corkum] underlying this process; double ionization through enhanced ionization (EIDI) with one electron escaping early on while the other ionizes later at intermediate distances of the nuclei of the remaining molecular ion [\cite=bandrauk1996] [\cite=Seideman] [\cite=Villeneuve]. Very recently, formation of highly excited neutral H atoms [\cite=Eichmann] was identified as yet another interesting phenomenon in driven H2. It was attributed to the "frustrated tunnel ionization" mechanism leading to the recapture of an electron. First seen in atoms [\cite=Eichmann2] this mechanism appears to be a general one underlying the formation of excited fragments during Coulomb explosion in strongly driven molecules [\cite=nubbe]. However, a full theoretical treatment and understanding is pending. This is partially due to the fact that theoretical studies including both nuclear and electronic motion in strongly driven systems are computationally very demanding. Most studies fix the nuclei and focus on electronic motion [\cite=Saenz2006] [\cite=Alnaser] or ignore the electronic continuum and study nuclear motion [\cite=nuclear]; in a recent refined study the electronic structure is used as input to study the energy spectra of the Coulomb exploding nuclei [\cite=Madsen].

In this Letter, we present the first comprehensive theoretical study on the break-up of strongly driven H2. We use a three-dimensional semi-classical approach that explicitly accounts for the Coulomb singularity. We focus on the Coulomb explosion process involving a highly excited neutral hydrogen atom (H*) and a proton. The difficulty in its theoretical treatment lies in the fact that, as we show, two-electron effects pervade the two pathways underlying the formation of H*. This is in contrast to one-electron effects pervading the well known enhanced ionization process. Moreover, correctly accounting for this process requires treating the electronic and nuclear motion on an equal footing. By doing so, we identify a transition with increasing laser intensity from symmetric to asymmetric energy sharing between H+ and H*. We show this asymmetry in energy sharing to be a striking signature of how the motion of a light particle--electron--influences the motion of heavy ones--nuclei. This questions whether this asymmetry could be predicted by the widely used in quantum mechanics Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation, since the latter assumes that the massive nuclei are nearly fixed with respect to electron motion.

Model. Our calculations are performed in a classical framework with the Coulomb singularity explicitly accounted for. Previously, we successfully used a three-dimensional classical model for fixed nuclei diatomics to predict new phenomena: an antiparallel electron escape for intermediate laser field intensities in the over-the-barrier regime [\cite=Emmanouilidou2009]. The current model extends our previous technique to also account for nuclear motion.

Our model entails setting up the initial phase space distribution. The electronic initial state is detailed in [\cite=Emmanouilidou2009] both for the tunneling and the over-the-barrier regime. We use 0.57 a.u. and 1.28 a.u. as the first and second ionization potentials, respectively. We take the initial vibrational state of the nuclei to be the ground state, [formula] a.u, of the Morse potential VM(R) = D(1 - e-  β(R - R0))2 with D = 0.174 a.u., β = 1.029 a.u. [\cite=WignerMorse] and R the inter-nuclear distance. We choose the Wigner distribution to describe the initial state of the nuclei due to the good agreement with the position and momentum distributions of the initial quantum mechanical state. (For the Wigner function of the ground state Morse potential see [\cite=WignerMorse]). We consider an intensity in the tunneling regime of 1.5×  1014 Watts/cm2 and an intermediate intensity in the over-the-barrier regime of 2.5×  1014 Watts/cm2. For this latter intensity, for the majority of trajectories the electronic state is initiated with the tunneling model, thus the term intermediate. Both intensities are high enough to justify restricting the initial distance of the nuclei to the equilibrium distance of the ground vibrational state, R0 = 1.4 a.u. [\cite=Saenz]. In our study, the laser pulse is aligned with the molecular axis, has frequency ω = 0.057 a.u. and a 10 cycle duration plus a 2 cycle turn-off--we use a cos pulse with a cos2 turn-off. After setting up the initial state, we transform to a new system of coordinates, the so called "regularized" coordinates [\cite=regularized]. This transformation explicitly eliminates the Coulomb singularity [\cite=Emmanouilidou2008] [\cite=Emmanouilidou2009]. We regularize using the global regularization scheme described in [\cite=global]. Finally, we propagate in time using the Classical Trajectory Monte Carlo method [\cite=CTMC]. (We note that to correctly account for EIDI and formation of H* we allow for both electrons to tunnel during propagation in a manner similar to that outlined in [\cite=Cohen].) We now select those trajectories leading to a break up of H2 with H+, H* (where *   denotes an electron in a n > 1 quantum state) and a free electron as fragments. To identify the electrons captured in a Rydberg n state we first find the classical [formula] where E is the potential plus kinetic energy of the electron. Next, we assign to this classical number a quantum one such that the relationship ((n - 1)(n - 1 / 2)n)1 / 3  ≤  nc  ≤  (n(n + 1 / 2)(n + 1))1 / 3, derived in [\cite=Mackellar], is satisfied.

As a result of our calculations we find that this H* ionization channel in the strongly driven H2 accounts for roughly 7-10% of the break-up events. We compute the probability distribution as a function of the kinetic energy of either one of the fragments H+, H* for 1.5×  1014 Watts/cm2 and 2.5×  1014 Watts/cm2, see Fig. [\ref=fig:excited] a) and b). We find that the maximum of the probability distribution is around 3.5 eV. This is in very good agreement with the experimental results in [\cite=Eichmann] and suggests that our model accurately describes this process. (The experimental peak at about 0.5 eV due to bond-softening is not addressed by the current work). Furthermore, we find that the distribution of principal quantum numbers n in H*, peaks around n = 8 resembling results for the atomic case [\cite=Eichmann2].

In a first attempt towards understanding, in [\cite=Eichmann] the formation of H* was attributed to one electron effects, i.e., "frustrated" (tunnel) ionization of the electron in H+2--assuming the first electron ionizes immediately. "Frustrated" ionization refers to the process where after tunneling an electron quivers in the laser field; when the field is turned off the electron does not have enough drift energy to overcome the Coulomb potential and gets captured in a Rydberg state. Our full classical calculation shows this conjecture to be partly true. It reveals that two electron effects pervade the two pathways that we find underlying the formation of H*. In the pathway we refer to as first, while the first electron--the one that tunnels in the initial state--quivers in the laser field, the initially bound second electron gains energy and ionizes. The second electron can gain energy through two mechanisms a) a non-sequential one, where the first tunnel electron transfers energy through a re-collision; b) a sequential one, where the the initially bound electron, independently of the first tunnel electron, ionizes at an intermediate distance of the nuclei through enhanced ionization of H+2. Both for a) and b) the first electron eventually undergoes "frustrated" ionization. In both cases the timing of the ionization of the second electron determines the kinetic energy of the fragments.

In the second pathway, the initially bound second electron gains energy through two mechanisms a) a non-sequential one where it undergoes a re-collision with the quasi-free first electron; b) a sequential one where the first electron ionizes fast and the bound electron gains energy through the lowered potential due to Coulomb explosion of the nuclei. Both for a) and b) the initially bound electron undergoes "frustrated" ionization.

Two-electron effects mostly prevail in the first pathway. Indeed, in this pathway the first electron quivers in the proximity of the nuclei before the bound electron ionizes. However, in the second pathway the first electron ionizes early on while excitation of the bound electron follows only afterwards. A finding corroborating the significant role of two-electron effects in the first pathway for small intensities is that the contribution of the first pathway decreases from 7% of all break-up events for 1.5 ×  1014 Watts/cm2 to half that for 2.5 ×  1014 Watts/cm2. This is consistent with the diminishing role of re-collisions with increasing intensity. On the other hand the second pathway's contribution remains constant around 4% for both intensities. Moreover, using as a rough criterion the presence of a re-collision (minimum in the distance of the two electrons) we can further separate the trajectories of the first and second pathways to sequential and non-sequential ones. We find that the non-sequential/sequential trajectories correspond to the first electron tunneling at positive/negative phases of the laser field. While non-sequential trajectories prevail for 1.5 ×  1014 Watts/cm2 sequential ones prevail for 2.5 ×  1014 Watts/cm2. Typical trajectories of the first and second pathway are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:HENH-NS] b) and Fig. [\ref=fig:HENH-EI] b), respectively.

From the above we conjecture that the non-sequential part of the first pathway of H* formation for 1.5 ×  1014 Watts/cm2 is the one that resembles the most non-sequential double ionization (NSDI)--for H* double ionization is frustrated and the first electron remains captured. Indeed, comparing Fig. [\ref=fig:HENH-NS] a) with Fig. [\ref=fig:HENH-NS] c) we find that the probability distribution for the energy of H+ or H* in the non-sequential part of the first pathway of H* is similar to the probability distribution for the energy of the two H+ fragments in the Delayed pathway of NSDI. We find that NSDI is roughly 2% of all break-up events. As is well known, the Delayed pathway--one electron ionizes with a delay, more than a quarter laser cycle, after re-collision--is one of the major energy transfer pathways in NSDI. (For details on the separation of NSDI pathways see [\cite=Emmanouilidou2009].) A comparison between Fig. [\ref=fig:HENH-NS] a) and Fig. [\ref=fig:HENH-NS] c) further shows that in the first pathway of H* formation the bound electron ionizes later compared to its ionization time in the Delayed pathway. Indeed, larger ionization times correspond to the nuclei Coulomb exploding at a later time, resulting in final energies of the nuclei smaller for H* compared to NSDI.

The sequential part of the second pathway of H* formation for 2.5 ×  1014 Watts/cm2 is the one resembling the most double ionization through enhanced ionization (EIDI)--for H* double ionization is frustrated and the second electron remains captured. As is well known (see [\cite=Niikura]) in the EIDI pathway the first electron ionizes fast while the initially bound one ionizes at an intermediate distance of the nuclei. We find that the EIDI process accounts for more than 50% of all events in agreement with previous results [\cite=Niikura]. For EIDI the probability distribution for the energy of H+ shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:HENH-EI] c) peaks at 3.5 eV, also roughly in agreement with previous results, see for example [\cite=Madsen]. A comparison of Fig. [\ref=fig:HENH-EI] a) with Fig. [\ref=fig:HENH-EI] c) shows that indeed the sequential part of the second pathway of H* formation resembles EIDI.

We have now established the pathways of energy transfer underlying H* formation. Next, we seek further insight into the underlying processes by considering the energy sharing between H+ and H*, see double energy differentials in Fig. [\ref=fig:excited] c) and d). We find that H+ and H* share the energy equally for 1.5×  1014 Watts/cm2 and unequally for 2.5×  1014 Watts/cm2, albeit the difference in energy sharing is small. The equal energy sharing is in very good agreement with the experimental results in [\cite=Eichmann] for an intensity of 3×  1014 Watts/cm2. However, the asymmetry we predict in energy sharing at 2.5×  1014 Watts/cm2 suggests that the experimental results have contributions from smaller intensities.

We find the transition from symmetric to asymmetric energy sharing to be related to the phase of the field at the time the first electron tunnels. For 1.5 ×  1014 Watts/cm2 the distribution of the phase of the laser field when the first electron tunnels is centered around zero, see Fig. [\ref=fig:mean] c). According to the three-step model, for phases around [formula] the first electron returns close to the nuclei. Indeed, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:mean] a), the first electron oscillates between the two nuclei in the z (field) direction for several periods before it finally gets captured in a Rydberg state of H. The return of the first electron close to the nuclei favors transfer of energy through the non-sequential H* mechanism, indeed the case for 1.5 ×  1014 Watts/cm2 as discussed above. Moreover, with the first tunnel electron oscillating between the two nuclei, the nuclei experience the same attractive force from the electron. This force combined with the repulsive force due to Coulomb explosion, results in a symmetric energy sharing of H+ and H*, see Fig. [\ref=fig:excited] c).

For 2.5 ×  1014 Watts/cm2 the distribution of the phase of the laser field when the first electron tunnels is centered mostly around -30[formula], see Fig. [\ref=fig:mean] d). For large negative phases the first electron does not return close to the nuclei. Instead, it remains on the same side that it tunneled from in the z direction before it gets captured, see Fig. [\ref=fig:mean] b). This behavior does not favor re-collisions and is consistent with our finding of sequential trajectories prevailing the formation of H* at this higher intensity. Moreover, the behavior of the first electron causes an asymmetry in the force experienced by the Coulomb exploding nuclei. The nucleus escaping along the same direction as the first electron experiences from this electron an attractive force that adds to the force due to Coulomb explosion. However, the nucleus escaping in the opposite z direction experiences an attractive force from the first tunnel electron that decreases the force from Coulomb explosion. This explains the asymmetry in energy sharing for 2.5 ×  1014 Watts/cm2 in Fig. [\ref=fig:excited] d).

In conclusion, we have shown that the H* formation in the break-up or Coulomb explosion of H2 in strong laser fields proceeds through two pathways. One where the first electron undergoes "frustrated" ionization while the initially bound electron ionizes by absorbing energy from the field or via a collision process. In the other pathway, the first electron ionizes and the second electron gains energy either from the field or the first electron and undergoes "frustrated" ionization. Furthermore, we have shown that for higher intensities electron tunneling at large negative phases gives rise to asymmetric energy sharing between H+ and H*. This asymmetry might not be possible to predict using the BO approximation since the latter assumes that the nuclei are nearly fixed with respect to the electronic motion. This could be checked quantum mechanically with H+2 since the asymmetry in energy sharing is mostly a one electron effect.
