Collective cavity QED with multiple atomic levels

Introduction

The coherent interaction between light and matter in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) has been under intensive study in recent years, especially in the context of quantum information processing [\cite=vanenk:04]. The essence of this interaction is captured by considering a two-level atom coupled to a single mode of the electromagnetic field inside a cavity [\cite=jaynes:63] [\cite=haroche:06]. However, for many physical systems, two important extensions to this model have to be taken into account. First, real scatterers often have a more complex level structure [\cite=birnbaum:06] and second, the coupling for N scatterers coupled to the same cavity mode is collectively enhanced [\cite=tavis:68]. Both extensions provide useful functionality in the context of quantum information processing. The collective enhancement has recently been used to store multiple microwave pulses in the collective modes of an electron spin ensemble [\cite=wu:10], whereas different levels could be used to collectively encode several qubits [\cite=pederson:09], resulting in quantum repeaters able to perform simple error correction [\cite=jiang:07].

Studying a system of N alkali-metal atoms coupled to a cavity allows one to study both effects in detail. When probing the system with π-polarized light for example, the transmission spectrum deviates strongly from the simple two-level picture. For a two-level atom, the spectrum shows a single splitting due to an avoided crossing between the energies of the state with one excitation in the atom and the state with one excitation in the cavity [\cite=boca:04]. Alkali-metal atoms have multiple hyperfine ground and excited states. In the spectrum, there are avoided crossings associated with the transitions between the different ground and excited states [\cite=birnbaum:06] and the net spectrum depends on the relative strength of the transitions and their separation. For N atoms the shape of the spectrum depends on the atom number N as well, because the size of the splittings that correspond to the different avoided crossings is collectively enhanced by a factor [formula], as has been observed for thermal atoms [\cite=raizen:89] [\cite=bernardot:92] [\cite=thompson:98] [\cite=tuchman:06] and for Bose-Einstein condensates [\cite=brennecke:07] [\cite=colombe:07].

Here, we experimentally investigate the transmission spectra of N [formula] atoms coupled to a high-finesse optical cavity when the system is weakly probed with π-polarized light. By changing the atom number, we are able to go from a regime where the size of the splittings is much smaller than the separation of the hyperfine excited states to a regime where both are of comparable size. Depending on the regime, we observe markedly different spectra. For low atom numbers, the spectrum shows separate splittings, whereas for higher atom numbers these merge into a single splitting. In the rest of this article, we first extend previous models of cavity QED with multiple hyperfine levels [\cite=birnbaum:06] [\cite=terraciano:07] [\cite=brennecke:09] [\cite=clemens:10] to derive an effective Hamiltonian describing our system and then detail the experiments performed and compare them with the predictions from theory.

Theory

Our setup is sketched in Fig. [\ref=fig:sketch] (a). We trap N [formula] atoms inside the mode of a high-finesse optical cavity. Our cavity is a Fabry-Pérot resonator with no discernible birefringence. Hence, it supports two orthogonal and degenerate modes of the electromagnetic field. By applying a magnetic field perpendicular to the optical axis of the cavity, we ensure that these modes correspond to π and [formula] transitions of the atom. The magnetic field is calculated to be 2.6 G, based on the coil geometry. We neglect the resulting differential Zeeman shifts of [formula] [\cite=steck:87] because they are small compared to the cavity linewidth of 5.3 MHz.

The experiments were performed on the transitions from the [formula] ground state to the [formula] excited states of the D2 line [\cite=steck:87]. A model Hamiltonian describing the system is

[formula]

Here, a and b are the annihilation operators for the cavity modes corresponding to π and [formula] transitions of the atom, [formula] is the resonance frequency of the cavity, [formula] is the operator projecting the i-th atom onto the excited state [formula], [formula] is the frequency of the transition from the [formula] ground state to the [formula] excited state, gi is the complex atom-cavity coupling constant of the i-th atom and [formula] denotes the Hermitian conjugate. [formula] and [formula] are the atomic dipole transition operators for the i-th atom from the [formula] excited state to the [formula] ground state, which take into account the different coupling strengths for the π and [formula] transitions.

We follow the convention in [\cite=birnbaum:06] to define the atomic dipole transition operators for an atom interacting with different polarizations of the light field as

[formula]

where q = { - 1,0,1} and μq is the dipole operator for {σ-,π,σ+}-polarization, normalized such that for the cycling transition from the [formula] to the [formula] state [formula]. For [formula]-polarized light we identify [formula].

In the experiment, we probe the system with π-polarized light after having prepared the atoms in a statistical mixture of mF states. For weak driving and large atom numbers the system behaves like a collective spin with one ground and three excited states coupled to the π-mode of the cavity, as indicated in Fig. [\ref=fig:sketch] (b). We model the system by the effective Hamiltonian

[formula]

which we derive in detail in Appendix [\ref=sec:deriv-reduc-hamilt]. The coupling of the collective spin is enhanced by a factor [formula] as compared to an effective single atom coupling constant [formula] that is an average of both the spatial dependence and the mF state dependence of the coupling of the individual atoms. Because we are only considering the case of weak driving, we restrict our discussion of the spectrum to the excitation manifold with a single excitation present in the system [\cite=birnbaum:06]. In this manifold, there are three avoided crossings between the energies of the bare cavity and the bare atom. If the crossings are well separated, we expect three splittings in the transmission spectrum of size [formula], separated by the hyperfine splitting of the excited states of [formula]. Solving the eigensystem for the Hamiltonian yields a more detailed description of the spectrum. We expect to see transmission when the probe laser frequency is resonant with the eigenenergies of the system, while the amount of transmission is proportional to the expectation value [formula] of the corresponding eigenstate [\cite=birnbaum:06]. Numerical calculations lead us to predict the detailed form of spectrum as summarized in Fig. [\ref=fig:avoided-crossing].

Experiment

We verify our predictions using the experimental setup sketched in Fig. [\ref=fig:sketch] (a). Its central element is a cavity made of two coned down spherical mirrors with radii of curvature of [formula] separated by [formula]. The transmission per mirror is [formula] and the losses are [formula], as estimated from measurements of the transmission, reflection and linewidth of the cavity. In terms of cavity QED parameters, our setup is described by [formula], where g is the maximum single atom coupling constant for the [formula] to [formula] transition, κ is the cavity field decay rate, and γ is the atomic dipole decay rate [\cite=hunger:10] [\cite=steck:87].

We start the experiment by loading atoms into an optical dipole trap in the [formula] ground state, similar to our previous experiments [\cite=arnold:11]. The dipole trap is formed by a beam with a wavelength of [formula] and a power of [formula] focused to a waist of [formula]. From there the atoms are evaporatively cooled into a transfer lattice formed by two counter-propagating beams of the same wavelength. Each lattice beam has a maximum power of [formula] and is focused to a waist of [formula] inside the cavity. By changing their relative frequency, the atoms are transported into the cavity [\cite=kuhr:01], which is located [formula] below the position of the dipole trap. Inside the cavity, the atoms are trapped in a two-dimensional lattice formed by the transfer lattice and an intra-cavity beam at [formula] with a circulating power of [formula] and a waist of [formula]. We also use this beam to stabilize the length of the cavity.

Within the cavity, the atoms are repumped into the [formula] ground state and the repumping beam is left on during the rest of the experiment. The atom-cavity system is probed through the cavity with light linearly polarized along the axis of quantization defined by the magnetic field. The intensity of the probe is adjusted to give a small mean photon number [formula] in the empty cavity. It is chosen to be as close as possible to the weak probing condition [formula] while still resulting in enough signal for the experiment. The transmission spectrum is recorded by directing the output of the cavity onto a single photon counting module. After probing the system, we measure the atom number via absorption imaging.

For each experiment the cavity detuning [formula] is fixed and we control the number of atoms by adjusting the power in the initial dipole trap. During the experiment the probe laser frequency is swept over the frequency range of interest, resulting in a transmission signal as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:single-run]. By repeating the experiment for different cavity detunings and different average atom numbers, we map out the transmission spectra, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:transmission].

Conclusion

To compare the measured spectra with our model predictions, we assume equal population of both the mF states and the lattice sites of the intra-cavity trap. For simplicity, we neglect the finite size of the cloud along the direction transverse to the optical axis of the cavity . Because the intra-cavity trap has a different lattice spacing than the mode of the cavity, the spatial averaging of gi gives [formula], as for a uniform distribution of atoms along the cavity axis. The agreement between the experiment and the model, as illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:avoided-crossing] and Fig. [\ref=fig:transmission], is obtained without any free parameters.

So far, we have neglected the effect of non-neglible driving strength. Our model assumes weak driving in order to describe the system as a collective spin. It will fail for higher driving strength since it predicts a strong non-linearity due to the saturation of the single spin. However, as the atom number increases, the system saturates at higher excitation numbers and loses the strong nonlinearity predicted by our simple model. Another effect we have neglected are the mF state changing processes either due to optical pumping or due to the weak relaxation via the undriven mode of the cavity. This is justified because the experiment was performed with a large number of atoms in a statistical mixture of all mF states. Thus, residual mF state changing processes are not expected to alter the distribution significantly. In a series of related experiments, we have started to investigate the dynamics of polarized gases, where the atoms are optically pumped into a particular mF state prior to their interaction with the cavity. In this case, we see evidence of mF changing processes, which in turn change the effective coupling [formula] of the system. These processes lead to complex dynamics, which will be an interesting topic for future investigations.

In summary, we have experimentally demonstrated that the linear response of a gas of alkali-metal atoms coupled to a high-finesse optical cavity is well described by a collective spin with multiple levels coupled to a single mode of the cavity. Using this system provides a flexible testbed for collective cavity QED with multiple atomic levels and the theoretical frame work is applicable to other physical systems used in quantum information processing. These include hybrid systems like alkali-metal atoms above a coplanar waveguide, collectively coupled to linearly polarized microwave photons [\cite=verdu:09], and nitrogen-vacancy centers coupled to a superconducting resonator, where a similar effect in the transmission spectrum has recently been observed [\cite=kubo:10].

Derivation of the reduced Hamiltonian

In order to derive the effective Hamiltonian of Eq. [\ref=eq:reduced-hamiltonian], we take a closer look at the interaction part [formula] of the full Hamiltonian of Eq. [\ref=eq:full-hamiltonian], that is,

[formula]

We will first consider the driven π-mode and then the undriven [formula]-mode. Driving the π-mode of the cavity populates the state where all the atoms are in the ground state and there is one π-photon in the cavity,

[formula]

Subsequent interaction with the cavity leads to transitions to the Dicke state, where one of the atoms is excited and the cavity is empty,

[formula]

The rate of which is collectively enhanced, i.e.,

[formula]

To calculate the effective single atom coupling rate [formula], we note that the coupling of the atom to the π-mode of the cavity depends on its position relative to the cavity field. Along the cavity axis the corresponding gi varies from maximum coupling for an atom at an anti-node of the cavity field, to zero coupling for an atom at a node. In the transverse direction the coupling varies as the Gaussian field distribution of the [formula] mode of the Fabry-Pérot cavity.

In addition to position, the coupling depends on the mF state of the atom via the Clebsch-Gordon coefficient [formula] that enters the dipole transition operator

[formula]

For a product state of N atoms, each in a particular mF state, the sum in the dipole transition operator [formula] has only one non-zero term for every atom. The operator then becomes a lowering operator, taking the i-th atom from the [formula] to the [formula] state, with a prefactor given by the Clebsch-Gordon coefficient and the spatially varying coupling constant gi, i.e.,

[formula]

For weak driving the ensemble behaves as a collective spin and the effective single atom coupling constant results from both an average over the spatial distribution of the atoms and their mF states, that is

[formula]

Here, [formula] is the coupling constant resulting from spatial variations in gi and p(mF) is the relative population in the different mF states. In the last step, we have assumed that enough atoms are in all of the mF states such that the atoms in each state independently average to [formula].

The undriven mode of the cavity is only populated by a transition of the excited state [formula] into the state where the cavity holds a [formula]-photon and the atoms are in a superposition of one of them having changed mF states, i.e.,

[formula]

The rate at which this process occurs is not collectively enhanced [\cite=terraciano:07] [\cite=clemens:10], i.e.,

[formula]

even if all mF states are macroscopically occupied [\cite=brennecke:09]. Because N  ≫  1 in the experiment, we restrict our treatment to the interaction with the driven π-mode of the cavity and arrive at the effective Hamiltonian for weak driving

[formula]

The treatment above is similiar to work in the area of quantum dots studying the vacuum-Rabi splitting in the presence of inhomogenous broadening [\cite=houdre:96].
