An inequality for means with applications

One often estimates individual values of a function by computing a certain means. This approach is particularly useful in situations where the conjectured maximum of a function is close to its mean, as is often the case in number theory. Here, we give a simple method which sometimes allows to improve the resulting estimates. To ease aplications, we formulate our result in the language of probability theory.

Let ξ be a non-negative real random variable, and suppose that [formula], and [formula] with a > 1. Then the probability P(ξ  ≥  a) is positive, and for every b < a we have

[formula]

We have

[formula]

which implies the claimed inequality. Now suppose that |ξ| < a almost surely. Then there exists some ε > 0, such that [formula], and we obtain

[formula]

a contradiction.

We now give three applications to quite different areas.

Our first application shows that the fourth moment of the Riemann ζ-function is dominated by large values of ζ, in fact, by values which are so large that the fourth moment itself cannot guarantee them to exist.

There is a constant C such that for t > T0(ε) and H > T2 / 3 log CT we have

[formula]

Ingham proved

[formula]

and Ivic and Motohashi[\cite=IM] showed that

[formula]

where P is a polynomial of degree 4 with leading term [formula] (confer also [\cite=HB]). Now apply Theorem 1 by setting

[formula]

for t∈[T,T  +  H] chosen at random and [formula].

Our second application slightly improves on the approach of Szekeres and Turán [\cite=ST] on the problem of Hadamard-matrices.

For every ε > 0 and n > n0(ε) there exists a skew-symmetric n  ×  n-matrix A with entries ±  1 satisfying

[formula]

Let A be a random skew-symmetric n  ×  n-matrix with entries ±  1, and let sk(n) be the k-th mean of the determinant of A. Szekeres[\cite=Szekeres] showed that

[formula]

Our claim now follows by applying our theorem to [formula].

Our last result improves on the work of Kerov and Vershik [\cite=KV] concerning the largest degree of an irreducible character of the symmetric group.

Let ε > 0 be given. Then for every n > n0(ε) there exists an irreducible character χ of Sn with [formula].

All irreducible complex representations of Sn can be realized over [formula], thus

[formula]

whereas the orthogonality relation implies [formula]. Finally, the number of irreducible characters equals the number p(n) of partitions of n, for which we have the asymptotic formula

[formula]

Define a random variable ξ as [formula], where χ is chosen at random among all irreducible characters, where each character has the same probability. Then we obtain

[formula]

and our claim follows.
