Macroscopic form of the first law of thermodynamics for an adiabatically evolving non-singular self-gravitating fluid

Introduction

We shall consider here the adiabatic evolution of a self-gravitating non-singular perfect fluid from the view point of first law of thermodynamics. By non-singular, we mean that we would not consider any black hole or naked singularity here. Further we shall analyze the problem in the framework of classical general relativity (GR) rather than any semi-classical or quantum gravity theory. In fact, it may be borne in mind that from the view point of classical GR, a Schwarzschild black hole is characterized by a single number which is its gravitational mass M0. Accordingly its entropy should be SBH(classical) = k ln 1 = 0. Also its temperature should be T = 0 because it cannot radiate.

It hardly needs to be reiterated that the first law thermodynamic (FLT) is a statement of total energy conservation. In its usual macroscopic form it says that the change in "internal energy" of a system having a fixed number of particles N is given by

[formula]

where dQ is the heat/radiation injected into the system and pdV is amount of work done by the system on its "surroundings". And if it would be assumed that there is neither any external heat injection nor any internal heat generation, then one would have dQ = 0. Thus, for a supposed adiabatic evolution of a perfect fluid, dQ = 0.

Now from purely Newtonian thermodynamics, if one would shift to special theory of relativity (STR), the internal energy should be replaced by the total mass energy E = Mic2, where Mi is the inertial mass of the system in its rest frame. Here c is the speed of light. However, we will mostly take G = c = 1. Since the spacetime is flat in STR, the volume element involved in Eq.(1), dV, continues to imply just the coordinate volume element: dV  =  dxdydz = R2dR sin θdθdφ, where θ and φ are polar angles. In this case, FLT becomes

[formula]

However if one would consider general theory of relativity (GTR), spacetime is curved and one must consider proper volume [formula] where h is the negative of the spatial part of the metric determinant g[\cite=1], i.e.,

[formula]

It must be so because in GR, (1) one can choose arbitrary coordinate system so that many forms of dV could be physically meaningless as a physical volume element and also because (2) in the presence of gravity the 3-space gets curved. Further, in curved spacetime, energy measured locally would be different from the one measured by a distant observer. And one needs to account for such a gravitational redshift factor too for a consistent macroscopic formulation of FLT.

Having made this preliminary background, let us recall that energy momentum is conserved at a given spacetime point in GR. Accordingly, in general relativity, one should first obtain a local microscopic FLT as has been extensively done by Tolman[\cite=1]:

[formula]

Here one considers an infinetisimal proper volume element δv and applies FLT. It is likely that, in the limit δv  →  0, the effect of global self-gravitational energy vanishes and one can indeed write

[formula]

Later, we shall rigourously verify that GR indeed yields such a microscopic version of FLT.

Finally we will arrive at the macroscopic local form of FLT (MFLT) for an adiabatically evolving spherical fluid by considering the effect of spacetime curvature.

Purely Local FLT

As is well known, the local energy momentum conservation is represented by the vanishing of the covariant divergence of the energy momentum tensor[\cite=1] [\cite=2] [\cite=3] [\cite=4] Tij:

[formula]

In terms of density of energy momentum tensor

[formula]

the energy momentum consevation can be expressed as[\cite=1]

[formula]

Suppose we are considering a spacetime metric of signature - 2 and a perfect fluid with energy momentum tensor:

[formula]

where ui the fluid 4-velocity, ρ is density and p is the isotropic pressure. If we would use comoving coordinates, ui has only the non-vanishing temporal component:

[formula]

where g00 = eν. Then one finds

[formula]

while

[formula]

Further,

[formula]

and

[formula]

Here Greek indices run from 1,2,3. Note, had there been any heat flow, Tij would have been non-diagonal. While the spatial part of Eq.(8) gives "momentum" conservation, the temporal part yields "energy" conservation. Accordingly, we consider j = 0 in Eq.(8) to obtain

[formula]

Using Eqs.(13) and (14), we simply the foregoing Eq. as

[formula]

Now using the fact - g  =  ( - h)g00,

[formula]

and

[formula]

Eq.(16) gets reduced to

[formula]

Since the comoving proper volume element is [formula] and Eq.(19) concerns partial derivative with respect to t, we can multiply it by δ3x to obtain

[formula]

And this can immediately be interpreted in terms of Eqs.(4) and (5) as equation for local energy conservation. Note, unlike Tolman[\cite=1] (p. 379), we derived Eqs.(19) and (20) without restricting g00 = 1. However, eventually, no g00 appears here because both ρδv and pδv represent locally measured energies. This clearly shows that, in curved spacetime, the pressure related work dw must be formulated in terms of the proper volume element dv rather than the flat volume element dV. It may be also noted that both ρδv and pδv are energies measured by the same local comoving frame. Therefore Eq.(4) indeed is a correct form of local GR FLT for adiabatic evolution. No self-gravitational energy appears here because of Principle of Equivalence (POE) by which gravitational energy may be made to vanish (only) at a given point.

Now, if we define

[formula]

as the volume expansion scalar, Eq.(20) may be also expressed as

[formula]

where an overdot represents differentiation w.r.t. comoving time t Note, however, that the more formal definition of the expansion scalar however is[\cite=2] [\cite=5]

[formula]

Particle Number Conservation

In the following, we shall explore the close link between microscopic FLT and conservation of total number of baryons or particles. If a comoving fluid element contains a fixed number of partcles δN and has a proper volume δv then[\cite=2]

[formula]

is conserved and accordingly the comoving temporal derivative of δN must be zero:

[formula]

while a more formal statement for particle number conservation[\cite=2] [\cite=3] [\cite=4] is:

[formula]

Note, Eq.(25) leads to

[formula]

Though [formula] does not appear here, one can nonethess divide the above equation by [formula] and interpret the time differentiation as w.r.t. proper time τ.

By using Eq.(27) in (22), we have

[formula]

And this may be rewritten as

[formula]

Note that, although the foregoing Eq. is supposed to be a GTR equations, no spacetime curvature term explicitly appears there. Consequently, one obtains exactly the same equations by applying STR as well[\cite=4]. The reason for this could be that, in the presence of gravity, all evoltion must be dissipative and non-adiabatic[\cite=6]. Conversely, all strictly adiabatic evolution may fall in the STR domain.

If now, we consider, N = 1, i.e., the volume δv contains a single particle and

[formula]

we will obtain the more familiar form of (local) FLT:

[formula]

Thus, for adibatic motion, the FLT is closely linked with particle number conservation, and in GR, both of which must be formulated in terms of proper volume element rather than coordinate volume element.

Adiabatic Evolution Equation of a Spherically Symmetric Fluid

Now we consider the specific case of a spherically symmetric adiabatic evolution by adopting the comoving spherically symmetric metric:

[formula]

Here R  =  R(r,t) is the areal coordinate, r is comoving radial coordinate. Physically r is proportional to the number of particles enclosed by a given mass shell; λ  =  λ(r,t); ν  =  ν(r,t). It is also conventional to write

[formula]

so that

[formula]

For the metric (32), one has

[formula]

and, the proper volume element is

[formula]

As we use Eqs.(34) and (35) in Eq.(19), we obtain[\cite=3]

[formula]

Thus, for the spherical symmetric case, by comparing Eqs.(22) and (37), we find that

[formula]

Let us also recall that the gravitational mass or Misner-Sharp mass of a section of the fluid in this case is given by[\cite=5]

[formula]

Macroscopic Ist Law of Thermodynamics

Now we shall consider application of FLT for an adibatically evolving spherical perfect fluid. This will be different from the local FLT which is strictly valid only at a point. If one would consider the motion of a shell with fixed number of particles, one would have

[formula]

And the coordinate volume swept by this shell is

[formula]

Accordingly, the flat spacetime FLT should be obtainable from

[formula]

But in curved spacetime one must consider the swept up proper volume element [\cite=1] rather than flat volume element:

[formula]

And if the spacetime has no gravitational redshift, the macroscopic form of adiabatic FLT would simply be

[formula]

Using Eq(43)., this becomes

[formula]

But if the total energy E is measured by a distant intertial observer S∞, note that the local pdv work will appear to S∞ as[\cite=6]

[formula]

owing to the gravitational redshift. Thus, for a purely adiabatic case, the macroscopic GR FLT would assume the form

[formula]

But by POE, we must have, Mi  =  M and E = M so that the above equation becomes

[formula]

Note that, indeed M is the ADM mass and is measured by a distant observer in an assumed asymptoptically flat spacetime.

Summary

We showed that

[formula] In GR, both local energy conservation and particle number conservation involve proper volume element rather than coordinate/flat volume element. It must be so because in curved spacetime, coordinate volume element could be meaningless.

[formula] Accordingly, we formulated here the First Law of Thermodynamics for an adiabatically evolving fluid which obeys particle number conservation

It is again reminded that, as per classical GR, a Schwarzschild black hole has zero entropy, and the ad-hoc idea of BH thermodynamics can be recoinciled only if BHs have zero surface[\cite=7] area or by yet unknown ad-hoc semi-classical gravity. In contrast, we are concerned here with mundane but solid classical GR. It will be shown in future work that the classical GR FLT obtained here has important consequences for (classical) gravitational collapse and cosmology.
