Introduction

This paper is concerned with the geometry of the moduli space [formula] of Gieseker semi-stable sheaves on [formula] with Hilbert polynomial [formula], i.e. semi-stable sheaves with support of dimension 1, with multiplicity 6 and Euler characteristic 1. The Fitting support of any such sheaf is a sextic curve. This work is a continuation of [\cite=drezet-maican] and [\cite=mult_five], where semi-stable sheaves supported on plane quartics, respectively plane quintics, were studied. We refer to the introductory section of [\cite=drezet-maican] for a motivation of the problem and for a brief historical context. We refer to the preliminaries section of op.cit. for a description of the techniques we shall use.

According to [\cite=lepotier], [formula] is a smooth irreducible rational projective variety of dimension 37. We shall decompose [formula] into five strata: an open stratum X0, two locally closed irreducible strata X1,X2 of codimensions 2, respectively 4, a locally closed stratum that is the disjoint union of two irreducible locally closed subsets X3 and X4, each of codimension 6, and a closed irreducible stratum X5 of codimension 8. The stratum X0 is an open subset inside a fibre bundle with fibre [formula] and base the moduli space [formula] of semi-stable Kronecker modules f:5O( - 2)  →  4O( - 1); X2 is an open subset inside a fibre bundle with fibre [formula] and base [formula], where Y is the smooth projective variety of dimension 10 constructed at [\ref=4.2]; X3 is an open subset inside a fibre bundle with fibre [formula] and base [formula], where [formula] is the moduli space of semi-stable Kronecker modules f:2O( - 1)  →  3O; X4 is birational to a fibre bundle with base [formula] and fibre [formula]. The closed stratum X5 is isomorphic to the Hilbert flag scheme of sextic curves in [formula] containing zero-dimensional subschemes of length 2.

Each locally closed subset [formula] is defined by the cohomological conditions listed in the second column of the table below. We equip Xi with the canonical induced reduced structure. In the third column of the table we describe, by means of locally free resolutions of length 1, all semi-stable sheaves F on [formula] whose stable-equivalence class is in Xi. Thus, for each Xi there are sheaves Ai,Bi on [formula], that are direct sums of line bundles, such that each sheaf F giving a point in Xi is the cokernel of some morphism [formula]. Let [formula] be the locally closed subset of injective morphisms [formula] satisfying the conditions from the third column of the table below. We equip Wi with the canonical induced reduced structure. In each case we shall prove that mapping [formula] to [formula] defines a map Wi  →  Xi that is a geometric quotient for the action by conjugation of [formula].

Let C be an arbitrary smooth sextic curve in [formula]. The generic sheaves in X0 have the form [formula], where Pi are ten distinct points on C not contained in a cubic curve. The generic sheaves in X3 have the form OC(2)( - P1 - P2 - P3 + P4), where Pi are four distinct points on C and P1,P2,P3 are non-colinear. The generic sheaves in X4 are of the form OC(1)(P1 + P2 + P3 + P4), where Pi are four distinct points on C, no three of which are colinear. The generic sheaves in X5 are of the form OC(2)( - P1 - P2), where P1,P2 are distinct points on C.

Let [formula] be the moduli space of semi-stable sheaves on [formula] with Hilbert polynomial [formula]. According to [\cite=maican-duality], the map

[formula]

Let [formula] denote the image of Xi under this isomorphism. [formula] represents a stratification of [formula]. [formula] is defined by the dual cohomological conditions, e.g. [formula] is defined by the conditions

[formula]

According to op.cit., lemma 3, the sheaves G on [formula] giving points in [formula] are precisely the sheaves of the form [formula], [formula]. For instance, [formula] consists of the stable-equivalence classes of those sheaves G having resolution of the form

[formula]

where ψ11 has linearly independent maximal minors and ψ22 has linearly independent entries. In this fashion we can obtain a "dual" table describing all semi-stable sheaves on [formula] with Hilbert polynomial [formula], the conditions on the morphisms being the transposed conditions from the table below. We omit the details.

Notations. V is a three-dimensional vector space over [formula]; we identify [formula] with [formula]; {X,Y,Z} is a basis of V*; [formula] is the dual of a one-dimensional sheaf F on [formula]; [formula] denotes the moduli space of semi-stable sheaves F on [formula] with Hilbert polynomial [formula]; [formula] is the slope of F; [formula] is the moduli space of Kronecker modules [formula] that are semi-stable for the action of [formula] (see 2.4 [\cite=drezet-maican]). For any other unexplained notations we refer to [\cite=drezet-maican] and [\cite=mult_five].

The open stratum

Every sheaf F giving a point in [formula] and satisfying the condition [formula] also satisfies the condition [formula]. These sheaves are precisely the sheaves with resolution of the form

[formula]

where [formula] is not equivalent to a morphism of the form

[formula], with ψ:mO( - 2)  →  mO( - 1), m = 1,2,3,4.

The statement follows by duality from 4.2 [\cite=maican].

Let [formula] and let [formula] be the set of morphisms [formula] from the proposition above. Let [formula] be the natural group acting by conjugation on [formula]. Let [formula] be the set of stable-equivalence classes of sheaves F as in the proposition above. Note that X0 is open and dense.

There exists a geometric quotient W0 / G0 and it is a proper open subset inside a fibre bundle with fibre [formula] and base [formula]. Moreover, W0 / G0 is isomorphic to X0.

The argument is identical to the argument at 3.2.1 [\cite=mult_five]. Let [formula] be a polarisation for the action of G0 on [formula] satisfying [formula]; W0 is the proper open invariant subset of injective morphisms inside [formula]. Let [formula] be the moduli space of semi-stable Kronecker modules f:5O( - 2)  →  4O( - 1) and let

[formula]

be the morphism of sheaves on [formula] induced from the universal morphism (notations as at 3.1.2 [\cite=drezet-maican]). Then U  =  p1*(Coker(θ*)) is a vector bundle of rank 18 on [formula] and [formula] is the geometric quotient [formula]. Thus W0 / G0 exists and is a proper open subset of [formula].

The canonical morphism W0 / G0  →  X0 is bijective and, since X0 is smooth, it is an isomorphism.

Let Y0  ⊂  X0 be the open subset of points given by sheaves [formula] for which the maximal minors of [formula] have no common factor. Let [formula] be the dual subset.

The sheaves G from [formula] have the form JZ(4), where [formula] is a zero-dimensional scheme of length 10 not contained in a cubic curve, contained in a sextic curve C, and JZ  ⊂  OC is its ideal sheaf.

The generic sheaves G in [formula] have the form [formula], where [formula] is a smooth sextic curve and Pi, 1  ≤  i  ≤  10, are distinct points on C not contained in a cubic curve. By duality, the generic sheaves F in X0 have the form [formula].

The sheaves G from [formula] are precisely the sheaves having resolution

[formula]

where the maximal minors of ψ12 have no common factor. In particular, ψ12 is semi-stable as a Kronecker V-module. According to [\cite=modules-alternatives], propositions 4.5 and 4.6, Coker(ψ12)≃IZ(4), where [formula] is a zero-dimensional scheme of length 10 not contained in a cubic curve. Thus G≃JZ(4), where C is given by the equation det (ψ) = 0. The converse is clear.

The codimension 2 stratum

Let F be a sheaf giving a point in [formula] and satisfying the conditions [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] or 1. The sheaves in the first case are precisely the sheaves with resolution of the form

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] is not equivalent to a morphism represented by a matrix of one of the following four forms:

[formula]

Assume that F gives a point in [formula] and satisfies the conditions [formula], [formula]. Write [formula]. The Beilinson free monad for F

[formula]

gives the resolution

[formula]

hence the exact sequence

[formula]

with [formula], [formula]. As in the proof of 2.1.4 [\cite=mult_five], we have [formula], hence we have the resolution

[formula]

with [formula]. From the injectivity of [formula] we see that m  ≤  2. If m = 2, then [formula] would be a destabilising subsheaf of F. We conclude that m = 0 or 1. In the first case F has resolution as in the proposition. The conditions on [formula] follow from the semi-stability of F.

Conversely, we assume that F has resolution as in the proposition and we need to show that there are no destabilising subsheaves E. We argue by contradiction, i.e. we assume that there is such a subsheaf E. We may take E to be semi-stable. As [formula], E gives a point in [formula] or [formula] for some r, 1  ≤  r  ≤  5. The cohomology groups [formula] and [formula] vanish because the corresponding cohomology groups for F vanish. From the description of [formula] and [formula], 1  ≤  r  ≤  5, found in [\cite=drezet-maican] and [\cite=mult_five], we see that E may have one of the following resolutions:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Resolution (1) must fit into a commutative diagram

[formula]

in which [formula] is injective (being injective on global sections). Thus [formula] is injective, too, and [formula], contradicting our hypothesis on [formula]. Similarly, every other resolution must fit into a commutative diagram in which [formula] and [formula] are injective on global sections. This rules out resolution (7) because in that case [formula] must be injective, hence [formula], which is absurd. If E has resolution (5), then [formula] is equivalent to a morphism represented by a matrix having one of the following two forms:

[formula]

where u1,u2,u3 are linearly independent one-forms. In the first case [formula], in the second case [formula]. Both situations are absurd. Assume that E has resolution (3). Since [formula] cannot be injective, we see that [formula] is equivalent to a morphism represented by a matrix of the form

[formula]

hence [formula], hence [formula], which is a contradiction. For resolutions (2), (4) and (6) [formula] and [formula] must be injective and we get the contradictions [formula], [formula], or [formula].

Let [formula] and let [formula] be the set of morphisms [formula] from proposition [\ref=3.1]. Let

[formula]

be the natural group acting by conjugation on [formula]. Let [formula] be the set of isomorphism classes of sheaves of the form [formula], [formula]. Note that X1 is a locally closed subset; we equip it with the canonical induced reduced structure.

There exists a geometric quotient W1 / G1 and it is isomorphic to X1.

We have a canonical morphism [formula] mapping [formula] to the isomorphism class of [formula]. Its fibres are G1-orbits. In order to show that [formula] is a categorical quotient map we use the method of 3.1.6 [\cite=drezet-maican]. We need to show that for given F in X1 resolution [\ref=3.1] can be obtained in a natural manner from the Beilinson spectral sequence converging to F. We prefer, instead, to start with the Beilinson spectral sequence of the dual sheaf [formula], which gives a point in [formula]. Diagram (2.2.3) [\cite=drezet-maican] for G takes the form

[formula]

The exact sequence (2.2.5) [\cite=drezet-maican] reads:

[formula]

We see from this that [formula] has no zero-dimensional torsion. The exact sequence (2.2.4) [\cite=drezet-maican] takes the form

[formula]

As in the proof of 3.2.4 [\cite=mult_five], we can show that [formula] is isomorphic to [formula]. The argument, we recall, uses the fact that [formula] has no zero-dimensional torsion. Thus we have an exact sequence

[formula]

Combining with the above resolution of G yields the resolution

[formula]

Dualising we obtain the exact sequence

[formula]

We saw in the proof of proposition [\ref=3.1] how this leads to the desired resolution of F.

Thus far we have proved that ρ is a categorical quotient map. According to [\cite=mumford], remark (2), p. 5, X1 is normal. Applying [\cite=popov-vinberg], theorem 4.2, we conclude that ρ is a geometric quotient map.

The codimension 4 stratum

The sheaves F giving points in [formula] and satisfying the cohomological conditions

[formula]

are precisely the sheaves with resolution of the form

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] are linearly independent one-forms, [formula] and the images of

[formula] and [formula] in [formula] are linearly independent.

Notice that the last two conditions are equivalent to saying that [formula] is not equivalent to a morphism represented by a matrix of one of the following four forms:

[formula]

At [\ref=3.1] we proved that a sheaf F in [formula] satisfying the above cohomologial conditions has a resolution as in the proposition. The conditions on [formula] follow from the semi-stability of F.

Assume now that F has a resolution as in the proposition and that E is a destabilising subsheaf. We have [formula], [formula] and, as at [\ref=3.1], we may assume that E gives a point in [formula] or [formula] for some r, 1  ≤  r  ≤  5. From the above we see that E may have one of the following resolutions:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Resolutions (1), (2), (4), (6), (7) and (10) must fit into commutative diagrams as diagram (*) at [\ref=3.1] in which [formula] is injective, being injective on global sections. Thus [formula] is also injective and we obtain the contradictory conclusions that [formula] are linearly dependent or that [formula] is equivalent to [formula], [formula] or [formula]. The remaining resolutions also fit into commutative diagrams (*) in which [formula] is injective on global sections and [formula] restricted to the first direct summand is also injective on global sections. Thus [formula] is injective in the case of resolutions (3), (8), (11), (12) and (13). This rules out resolution (13) since in that case [formula] cannot be injective. Assume that E has resolution (3). Then

[formula]

for some non-zero u,v∈V*. We obtain the contradictory conclusions that [formula], or [formula], or that [formula] and [formula] are linearly dependent. For resolutions (8), (11) and (12) we have

[formula]

where "[formula]" stands for a non-zero entry. We obtain the contradictory conclusions that [formula] or [formula]. Assume that E has resolution (5). Then [formula] is equivalent to a morphism represented by a matrix having one of the following forms:

[formula]

where u  ≠  0 and u1,u2 are linearly independent one-forms. In the first two cases [formula] is injective, so it has the form

[formula]

for some non-zero v∈V*. We obtain the contradictory conclusions that [formula] are linearly dependent or that [formula]. In the third case we have [formula], hence [formula] has one of the following two forms:

[formula]

for some non-zero v∈V*. We get [formula] or [formula], both contradictions. Finally, assume that E has resolution (9). Notice that [formula], hence also [formula], cannot be injective. As [formula] and [formula] are injective on global sections, we deduce that [formula] is equivalent to a morphism represented by a matrix having one of the following forms:

[formula]

where u1,u2,u3 are linearly independent one-forms. In the first case we have [formula], hence [formula] has the form

[formula]

for some non-zero v∈V*. We obtain [formula], which contradicts our hypothesis on [formula]. In the second case we have [formula]. This is absurd, [formula] cannot be a subsheaf of 4O( - 2).

Consider the vector space [formula] which is acted upon by the algebraic group [formula]. We represent the elements of G by pairs (g,h) of matrices

[formula]

Inside G we distinguish two subgroups: a reductive subgroup [formula] given by the conditions u21 = 0, u31 = 0 and a unitary subgroup G' consisting of pairs (g,h) of the form

[formula]

Consider the open G-invariant subset [formula] of morphisms

[formula]

have linearly independent images in [formula].

There exists a geometric quotient U / G and it is a smooth projective variety of dimension 10. There exists a geometric quotient U / G' and the canonical morphism U / G'  →  U / G is a geometric quotient for the induced action of [formula] on U / G'.

Let [formula] be in [formula]. As mentioned at [\ref=4.1], [formula] belongs to U precisely if it is not in the orbit of a morphism represented by a matrix having one of the following forms:

[formula]

We will now use the theory of quotients modulo non-reductive groups developed in [\cite=drezet-trautmann]. Let [formula] be a polarisation for the action of G on [formula] satisfying the conditions:

[formula]

[formula]

We claim that the set of semi-stable points relative to L coincides with the set of stable points and coincides with U. This follows from King's criterion of semi-stability [\cite=king]. In our situation this criterion says the following (put ł3  =  ł2, [formula]): a morphism [formula] is semi-stable relative to L (respectively stable) precisely if for any morphism ψ in the orbit of [formula], for any zero-submatrix A of the matrix representing ψ, the sum of the [formula], i = 1,2, corresponding to the rows of A and the łj, j = 1,2,3, corresponding to the columns of A is at most 1 (respectively less than 1 in the stable case). Take [formula]. The first four conditions on L imply that [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  4, hence [formula] belongs to U. Given [formula] in U, the only possible morphisms ψ in the orbit of [formula] that are represented by a matrix having a zero-submatrix must have one of the following forms:

[formula]

In order to ensure that [formula] be stable we must check the condition arising from King's criterion for each possible equivalence [formula]. For the equivalence [formula] the condition [formula] arises. For the equivalence [formula] the condition [formula] arises. These conditions are fulfilled by hypothesis. Thus [formula] belongs to [formula]. We have shown the inclusions [formula], hence these three sets coincide.

Relations 3.3.1 [\cite=drezet-trautmann] for our situation read as follows: ł1  >  0, ł2  >  0, ł1  +  2ł2 = 1, [formula]. In view of these relations, the polarisations L satisfying the six conditions from above are precisely the polarisations L  =  (ł1,ł2,1 / 2) for which 1 / 4  <  ł2  <  1 / 2.

We quote below conditions 7.2.2 and 8.1.3 from op.cit. applicable to our situation:

[formula]

According to op.cit., propositions 6.1.1, 7.2.2 and 8.1.3, the above conditions are sufficient to ensure the existence of a projective good quotient [formula] which contains a smooth geometric quotient [formula] as an open subset. Here [formula], [formula], [formula]. The constant c1(2) is defined at 7.1 op.cit. According to remark 9.4.1 in the preliminary version of [\cite=drezet-trautmann], we have c1(2) = 1 / 5. The four sufficient conditions from above are equivalent to the inequalities 3 / 7  <  ł2  <  1 / 2. Fix now a polarisation L satisfying these conditions. We have [formula], hence a geometric quotient U / G exists and is a smooth projective variety.

Next we prove the existence of a geometric quotient U / G'. Consider the open subset U0 of injective morphisms inside [formula]. Let U1 be the trivial vector bundle over U0 with fibre [formula]. U is an open G-invariant subset of U1. Let S  ⊂  U1 be the sub-bundle with fibre [formula] at every point [formula]. The quotient bundle Q  =  U1 / S is a geometric quotient of U1 modulo the action of G'. The image of U in U1 / G' is the geometric quotient U / G'. Let π':U  →  U / G' denote the quotient map.

The quotient map π:U  →  U / G is G'-equivariant, hence it factors through a surjective morphism [formula]. We consider the action of [formula] on U / G' defined by [formula]. Clearly this action is well-defined and the fibres of [formula] are [formula]-orbits.

Let F  ⊂  U / G' be a closed [formula]-invariant subset. π'- 1(F) is closed and G-invariant, hence [formula] is closed in U / G.

Let D  ⊂  U / G be an open subset and let [formula] be a function such that [formula] is regular. The composition [formula] is regular hence, by the fact that π is a geometric quotient map, we deduce that f is regular. Thus [formula] maps O(D) isomorphically to [formula].

Let D  ⊂  U / G be an open affine subset. Since π is affine, π- 1(D) is an open affine subset of U. Notice that π':U  →  U / G' is a locally trivial principal G'-bundle with fibre G'. It follows that [formula] can be identified with a closed subvariety of [formula], hence [formula] is affine. Thus [formula] is an affine map. From all that was said above we conclude that [formula] is a geometric quotient map.

Let [formula] and let [formula] be the set of morphisms [formula] from proposition [\ref=4.1]. Let

[formula]

be the natural group acting by conjugation on [formula]. Let [formula] be the set of isomorphism classes of sheaves of the form [formula], [formula]. Note that X2 is a locally closed subset; we equip it with the canonical induced reduced structure.

There exists a geometric quotient W2 / G2 and it is a smooth quasi-projective variety of dimension 33. Let Y be the geometric quotient U / G from proposition [\ref=4.2]. W2 / G2 is an open subset inside a fibre bundle with fibre [formula] and base [formula].

The proof is almost identical to the proof of 3.2.3 [\cite=mult_five] with notational differences only. Let [formula] be the locally closed subset of morphisms [formula] satisfying the conditions from proposition [\ref=4.1] except injectivity. The pairs of morphisms [formula] form an open subset [formula] and the morphisms [formula] form an open subset [formula]. We denote U  =  U1  ×  U2. W2' is the trivial vector bundle on U with fibre [formula]. We represent the elements of G2 by pairs (g,h) of matrices

[formula]

Inside G2 we distinguish four subgroups: a reductive subgroup [formula] given by the conditions uij = 0, vij = 0, the subgroup S of pairs (g,h) of the form

[formula]

with [formula], and two unitary subgroups G2', G2''. Here G2' consists of pairs (g,h) of morphisms of the form

[formula]

while G2'' is given by pairs (g,h), where

[formula]

Note that [formula]. Consider the G2-invariant subset [formula] given by the conditions

[formula]

[formula]

W2 is the subset of injective morphisms inside [formula]. We will construct a geometric quotient of [formula] modulo G2 and it will follow that W2 / G2 exists and is an open subset of [formula].

It is easy to see that [formula] is a sub-bundle of W2'. The quotient bundle, denoted E', has rank 22. The quotient map W2'  →  E' is a geometric quotient modulo G2'. The canonical action of [formula] on U is E'-linearised and the map W2'  →  E' is [formula]-equivariant.

Next we construct a geometric quotient of E' modulo G2''. The quotient for the base U is (U1 / G')  ×  U2, where G' is the group from proposition [\ref=4.2]. The quotient U1 / G' was constructed in the proof of loc.cit., where it was noticed that the quotient map U1  →  U1 / G' is a locally trivial principal G'-bundle with fibre G'. Thus U  →  U / G2'' is a locally trivial principal G2''-bundle with fibre G2''. According to 4.2.14 [\cite=huybrechts], E' descends to a vector bundle E over U / G2''. The canonical map E'  →  E is a geometric quotient modulo G2''. The composed map W2'  →  E'  →  E is a geometric quotient modulo G2'G2''. The canonical induced action of [formula] on U / G2'' is linearised with respect to E and the map W2'  →  E is [formula]-equivariant.

Let x∈U / G2'' be a point and let ξ∈Ex be a non-zero vector lying over x. The stabiliser of x in [formula] is S and [formula]. Let [formula] be the zero-section of E. The canonical map [formula] is a geometric quotient modulo S.

We finally construct a geometric quotient of [formula] modulo the induced action of [formula]. By proposition [\ref=4.2], [formula] exists and is isomorphic to the smooth 12-dimensional projective variety [formula]. We consider the character χ of [formula] given by χ(g,h) =  det (g) det (h)- 1. We multiply the action of [formula] on E by χ and we denote the resulting linearised bundle by Eχ. The action of S on Eχ is trivial, hence Eχ is [formula]-linearised. The isotropy subgroup in [formula] for any point in U / G2'' is trivial, so we can apply [\cite=huybrechts], lemma 4.2.15, to deduce that Eχ descends to a vector bundle F over [formula]. The map Eχ  →  F is a geometric quotient modulo [formula]. The same can be said of the map [formula].

We conclude by observing that the composed map [formula] is a geometric quotient modulo G2 and that W2 / G2 exists and is a proper open subset of [formula].

The geometric quotient W2 / G2 is isomorphic to X2.

As at [\ref=3.2], we will show that the canonical morphism [formula] is a categorical quotient map. The isomorphism W2 / G2≃X2 will follow from the uniqueness of the categorical quotient. Consider the sheaf [formula]. Diagram (2.2.3) [\cite=drezet-maican] for G takes the form

[formula]

[formula] is isomorphic to the structure sheaf [formula] of a point because it is a quotient sheaf of G. Thus [formula] and the exact sequence (2.2.5) [\cite=drezet-maican] reads

[formula]

We see from this that [formula] has no zero-dimensional torsion, which allows us to deduce, as in the proof of 3.2.4 [\cite=mult_five], that [formula]. From (2.2.4) [\cite=drezet-maican] we get the exact sequence

[formula]

We now apply the horseshoe lemma to the extension

[formula]

and to the resolutions

[formula]

[formula]

The morphism [formula] lifts to a morphism O( - 1)  →  G because [formula] vanishes. We obtain the resolution

[formula]

The map O( - 3)  →  O( - 3) above is non-zero because [formula] vanishes. Canceling O( - 3) and combining with the above resolution of [formula] yields the exact sequence

[formula]

Dualising we get the exact sequence

[formula]

As in the proof of [\ref=3.1], the above leads to a resolution of the form

[formula]

in which the map O( - 1)  →  2O( - 1) is zero. In conclusion, we have obtained resolution [\ref=4.1] in a natural manner from the Beilinson spectral sequence of F (or of G). This allows us to conclude, as at 3.1.6 [\cite=drezet-maican], that [formula] is a categorical quotient map.

The codimension 6 stratum

The sheaves F in [formula] satisfying the conditions [formula] and [formula] are precisely the sheaves with resolution

[formula]

where [formula] has linearly independent entries and [formula] has linearly independent maximal minors.

Assume that F gives a point in [formula] and satisfies the cohomological conditions from the proposition. The sheaf [formula] gives a point in [formula] and satisfies the dual conditions [formula] and [formula]. We put [formula]. The Beilinson free monad yields the resolution

[formula]

[formula]

Here [formula]. As G has rank zero and maps surjectively onto [formula], we have m  ≤  3. If m = 3, then C has Hilbert polynomial [formula], so it is a destabilising quotient sheaf of G. The cases m = 0 and m = 1 can be eliminated using the arguments from the proof of 3.1.3 [\cite=mult_five]. Thus m = 2. As in the proof of 3.2.5 [\cite=mult_five], we may assume that ψ is represented by the matrix

[formula]

By duality, we obtain a monad for F of the form

[formula]

yielding a resolution

[formula]

From this we get a resolution

[formula]

in which [formula]. We finally arrive at the resolution of F from the proposition. The conditions on [formula] in the proposition follow from the semi-stability of F. If [formula] had linearly dependent entries, then F would map surjectively onto a sheaf with Hilbert polynomial [formula]. If [formula] had linearly dependent maximal minors, then it would be equivalent to a morphism represented by a matrix with a zero-row or a zero-submatrix of size 2  ×  1. Thus F would have a destabilising subsheaf with Hilbert polynomial [formula] or t + 1.

Conversely, we assume that F has a resolution as in the proposition and we need to show that there are no destabilising subsheaves. From the snake lemma we get an extension

[formula]

in which [formula] is the structure sheaf of the point given by the ideal generated by the entries of [formula] and F' has resolution of the form

[formula]

in which [formula]. According to proposition [\ref=5.2] below, F' is semi-stable and the only possible subsheaves of F' of slope zero must be of the form OL( - 1) for a line [formula]. It follows that for every subsheaf E  ⊂  F we have [formula] except, possibly, subsheaves that fit into an extension of the form

[formula]

We have E≃OL because E has no zero-dimensional torsion. If F had such a subsheaf, then we would get a commutative diagram with exact rows

[formula]

in which [formula] is injective, because it is injective on global sections, hence [formula] is also injective. It would follow that [formula] is equivalent to a morphism represented by a matrix with only one non-zero entry on the last column. This would violate our hypothesis on [formula].

Let F be a sheaf with resolution of the form

[formula]

in which ψ12 has linearly independent maximal minors. Then F is semi-stable, i.e. it gives a point in [formula]. If the maximal minors of ψ12 have no common factor, then F is stable. If they have a common linear factor [formula], then OL( - 1)  ⊂  F is the unique proper subsheaf of slope zero, where [formula] is the line with equation [formula].

Assume that the maximal minors of ψ12 have no common factor. By analogy with 2.3.4(i) [\cite=mult_five], F is isomorphic to JZ(2), where [formula] is a zero-dimensional scheme of length 3 not contained in a line, contained in a sextic curve C, and JZ  ⊂  OC is its ideal sheaf. Let I be a subsheaf of JZ. According to 6.7 [\cite=maican], there is a sheaf J such that I  ⊂  J  ⊂  OC, J  /  I is supported on finitely many points and OC  /  J is isomorphic to the structure sheaf of a curve C' contained in C. Excluding the uninteresting case when J has multiplicity 6, we have the following possibilities for the Hilbert polynomial [formula] of J, depending on the degree of C': 5t - 10, 4t - 10, 3t - 9, 2t - 7, t - 4. From this we see that [formula] except in the case when I  =  J and [formula], i.e. when J is the kernel of a surjective morphism OC  →  OL for a line L  ⊂  C. This situation is ruled out if we take into account that Z may not be a subscheme of a line.

Assume now that the maximal minors of ψ12 have a common linear factor [formula]. As at 2.3.4(ii) [\cite=mult_five], we have an extension

[formula]

where L is the line with equation [formula] and C is a quintic curve. Thus F is semi-stable and OL( - 1), OC(1) are its stable factors. The latter cannot be a subsheaf of F because [formula] vanishes.

Let [formula] and let [formula] be the set of morphisms [formula] from proposition [\ref=5.1]. Let

[formula]

be the natural group acting by conjugation on [formula]. Let [formula] be the set of isomorphism classes of sheaves of the form [formula], [formula]. X3 is a locally closed subset which we equip with the canonical induced reduced structure.

The generic sheaves in X3 have the form OC(2)( - P1 - P2 - P3 + P4), where [formula] is a smooth sextic curve, Pi, 1  ≤  i  ≤  4, are distinct points on C and P1,P2,P3 are non-colinear.

According to propositions [\ref=5.1] and [\ref=5.2], the generic sheaves in X3 are precisely the non-split extension sheaves of the form

[formula]

where [formula] is a zero-dimensional scheme of length 3 not contained in a line, contained in a sextic curve C, and JZ  ⊂  OC is its ideal sheaf. Take C to be smooth, take Z to be the union of three distinct points different from x. Then F≃OC(2)( - P1 - P2 - P3 + x). Conversely, it can be easily seen that any such sheaf is in X3.

There exists a geometric quotient W3 / G3 and it is a proper open subset inside a fibre bundle over [formula] with fibre [formula]. W3 / G3 is isomorphic to X3.

The proof for the first statement is identical to the proof of 2.2.2 [\cite=mult_five]. Let W3' be the locally closed subset of [formula] given by the following conditions: [formula], [formula] has linearly independent entries, [formula] has linearly independent maximal minors. Let [formula] be the G3-invariant subset given by the condition

[formula]

As at loc.cit., we can construct a vector bundle Q over [formula] of rank 24, such that [formula] is a geometric quotient of [formula] modulo G3. Then W3 / G3 is a proper open subset of [formula].

Let F give a point in X3 and let [formula]. The Beilinson tableau (2.2.3) [\cite=drezet-maican] for G takes the form

[formula]

The exact sequence (2.2.5) [\cite=drezet-maican] for this situation reads:

[formula]

We see from the above that Coker(ψ4) has no zero-dimensional torsion and that there are no non-zero morphisms OL(1)  →  Coker(ψ4) for any line [formula]. This allows us to deduce, as at [\cite=mult_five], 3.1.3 and 3.2.5, that ψ3 is equivalent to the morphism represented by the matrix

[formula]

i.e. that [formula]. The Beilinson tableau for F has the form

[formula]

The morphism [formula] is dual to ψ3, hence [formula]. Write [formula]. The exact sequence

[formula]

yields the resolution

[formula]

C has rank zero because it is a quotient sheaf of F. Thus [formula]. If [formula], then C would map surjectively onto the cokernel C' of a morphism 2O( - 3)  →  2O( - 2). C' would then be a destabilising quotient sheaf of F. Thus [formula] and we arrive at an exact sequence

[formula]

Using the semi-stability hypothesis on F it is easy to see that C is isomorphic to the structure sheaf of a point and that [formula] is isomorphic to O( - 4). The exact sequence (2.2.5) [\cite=drezet-maican] takes the form

[formula]

We apply the horseshoe lemma to the extension

[formula]

to the above resolution of C and to the resolution

[formula]

We obtain the exact sequence

[formula]

The map O( - 4)  →  O( - 4) is non-zero because [formula]. Canceling O( - 4) yields resolution [\ref=5.1]. Thus, for a sheaf F giving a point in X3 we have obtained resolution [\ref=5.1] in a natural manner from the Beilinson spectral sequence. As at 3.1.6 [\cite=drezet-maican], we conclude that the canonical bijective morphism W3 / G3  →  X3 is an isomorphism.

X3 lies in the closure of X2.

The argument can be found at 2.1.6 [\cite=mult_five], or at 3.2.3 [\cite=drezet-maican]. Using the Beilinson monad for F( - 1) we see that the open subset [formula] given by the conditions [formula] and [formula] is parametrised by an open subset M inside the space of monads of the form

[formula]

Consider the map [formula] defined by Φ(A,B) = B. Using the vanishing of [formula] for an arbitrary sheaf F giving a point in U, we can prove that M is smooth and that Φ has surjective differential at every point. This further leads to the conclusion that the set of monads in M whose cohomology sheaf F satisfies the relation [formula] is included in the closure of the set of monads for which [formula]. Thus X3 lies in the relative closure of X2 in U, hence [formula].

The sheaves F giving a point in [formula] and satisfying the cohomological conditions [formula] and [formula] are precisely the sheaves having a resolution of the form

[formula]

[formula]

where q1,q2 are linearly independent two-forms without a common linear factor, or of the form

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] are linearly independent one-forms, [formula], and there are no linear forms u,v1,v2 such that [formula].

Consider a sheaf F in [formula] satisfying the cohomological conditions from the proposition. Put [formula]. The Beilinson free monad for [formula] reads

[formula]

and yields the resolution

[formula]

We have m  ≥  3. Moreover, m  ≤  4 because G maps surjectively onto the cokernel C of the morphism [formula]. If m = 4, then C has Hilbert polynomial [formula], hence it is a destabilising quotient sheaf of G. We deduce that m = 3. As in the proof of 3.2.5 [\cite=mult_five], we can show that the morphism 2O( - 2)  →  7O( - 1) occurring in the resolution is equivalent to the morphism represented by the matrix

[formula]

Recall that the argument rests on the fact that the only morphism OL(1)  →  G, for a line [formula], is the zero-morphism. Indeed, both OL(1) and G are semi-stable and the slope of the first sheaf exceeds the slope of the second sheaf. Thus far we have a resolution

[formula]

Resolving [formula] yields the resolution

[formula]

As in the proof of 2.1.4 [\cite=mult_five], it can be shown that the map 3O( - 2)  →  3O( - 2) has rank 3. We arrive at the resolution

[formula]

According to [\cite=maican-duality], lemma 3, taking duals yields the resolution

[formula]

Resolving [formula] leads to the resolution

[formula]

As [formula] is injective, [formula] is at lest 4. If [formula], then F would have a destabilising quotient sheaf arising as the cokernel of an injective morphism 2O( - 3)  →  2O( - 2).

When [formula] we get resolution (i). The conditions on q1 and q2 in the statement follow from the semi-stability of F. Thus, if q1,q2 had a common linear factor, say [formula], then we would get a commutative diagram

[formula]

[formula]

Here L is the line with equation [formula]. From the shake lemma we see that F would map surjectively into OL( - 1), in violation of semi-stability.

Finally, when [formula] we get resolution (ii). Again, the conditions on [formula] follow from the semi-stability of F. For instance, if [formula], then [formula] would be equivalent to the morphism represented by the matrix

[formula]

hence OL( - 1) would be a destabilising quotient sheaf of F. Here [formula] is the line with equation [formula].

Conversely, we assume that F has resolution (i) and we need to show that F is semi-stable. Equivalently, we need to show that the dual sheaf [formula] gives a point in [formula]. Taking duals in (i) yields the resolution

[formula]

[formula]

Let Z be the zero-dimensional scheme of length 4 given by the ideal (q1,q2). Let [formula] be the sextic curve with equation q1g2  -  q2g1  =  0. Let JZ  ⊂  OC be the ideal sheaf of Z inside C. It is clear from the above resolution that G is isomorphic to JZ(3), so we must show that JZ is semi-stable. Let S  ⊂  JZ be a subsheaf. According to [\cite=maican], lemma 6.7, there is an ideal sheaf A  ⊂  OC containing S such that A  /  S is supported on finitely many points and OC  /  A≃OS for a curve S  ⊂  C of degree d. We may assume that 1  ≤  d  ≤  5. We have

[formula]

Thus [formula] unless d = 1 and A  =  S. But in this case S is a line and Z is a subscheme of S. From Bezôut's theorem we see that the equation of S divides both q1 and q2, which is contrary to our hypothesis. We conclude that G is semi-stable.

We now assume that F has resolution (ii) and we aim at showing that F is semi-stable. We shall first examine the case when [formula] does not divide h. Let x be the point given by the equations [formula]. Let [formula] be the zero-dimensional scheme of length 3 given by the ideal [formula] and let IZ  ⊂  O be its ideal sheaf. Let [formula] be the sextic curve given by the equation [formula]. Let JZ  ⊂  OC be the ideal sheaf of Z in C. We apply the snake lemma to an exact diagram similar to the diagram in the proof of 3.1.2(ii) [\cite=mult_five] to get the exact sequence

[formula]

which leads to the exact sequence

[formula]

Let F'  ⊂  F be a subsheaf. Put [formula] and let C be the image of F' in [formula]. We shall estimate the slope of F' by the same method as above. There is a sheaf A  ⊂  OC(2) containing K such that A  /  K is supported on finitely many points and OC(2) / A≃OS(2) for a curve S  ⊂  C of degree d. We may assume that 1  ≤  d  ≤  5 and we have

[formula]

Thus [formula] unless d = 1, [formula] and A  =  K. In this case K≃OQ(1), where [formula] is a quintic curve. Thus F' is a non-split extension of [formula] by OQ(1). According to 3.1.5 [\cite=mult_five], F' has a resolution of the form

[formula]

This resolution must fit into a commutative diagram of the form

[formula]

Notice that [formula] is injective on global sections, hence [formula]. Moreover, [formula] cannot be isomorphic to O( - 2) because it is a subsheaf of 2O( - 3). Thus [formula] is injective, and so is [formula]. Modulo elementary operations on rows and columns we have four possibilities: [formula] or [formula] and [formula] or [formula], where

[formula]

Here u and v are non-zero one-forms. If [formula] and [formula], then [formula] is equivalent to a morphism represented by a matrix of the form

[formula]

in violation of our hypothesis. If [formula] and [formula], then [formula], again contradicting the hypothesis. When [formula] we obtain the contradictory conclusion that [formula] and [formula] are linearly dependent. This shows that F cannot have a destabilising subsheaf F'.

Lastly, we examine the case when [formula] divides h. We may assume that h  =  0. Let L be the line given by the equation [formula] and let E be the sheaf given by the exact sequence

[formula]

[formula]

According to 3.1.5 [\cite=mult_five], E gives a point of [formula]. Since F is an extension of E by OL( - 1), we have [formula] for every proper subsheaf F'  ⊂  F, unless the induced map F'  →  E is an isomorphism. However, we have seen above that E cannot be isomorphic to a subsheaf of F.

Let [formula], let [formula] be the set of injective morphisms with semi-stable cokernel. We claim that W4 is open. To see this consider the open subset [formula] of injective morphisms. The family of sheaves [formula], [formula], is flat over W4'. Semi-stability is an open condition on flat families, hence W4 is open in W4'. Let

[formula]

be the natural group acting by conjugation on [formula]. Let [formula] be the set of isomorphism classes of sheaves of the form [formula], [formula]. We equip X4 with the canonical induced reduced structure.

There exists a geometric quotient W4 / G4 and it is isomorphic to X4.

Let F give a point in X4 and let [formula]. The Beilinson tableau (2.2.3) [\cite=drezet-maican] for G takes the form

[formula]

As at 2.2.4 [\cite=mult_five], we have [formula] and [formula]. The exact sequence (2.2.5) [\cite=drezet-maican] takes the form

[formula]

As at 3.2.5 [\cite=mult_five], it can be shown that [formula] is equivalent to the morphism represented by a matrix of the form

[formula]

Combining the above resolution of G with the exact sequence

[formula]

we obtain the resolution

[formula]

We have seen at [\ref=5.6] how the above leads to a resolution

[formula]

with [formula]. This construction of [formula] is natural, so it works for local flat families of sheaves giving points in X4. As at 3.1.6 [\cite=drezet-maican], we may infer that the canonical map W4  →  X4 is a categorical quotient map. According to [\cite=mumford], remark (2), p. 5, X4 is normal. Applying [\cite=popov-vinberg], theorem 4.2, we conclude that W4  →  X4 is a geometric quotient map.

The generic sheaves in X4 are of the form OC(1)(P1  +  P2  +  P3  +  P4), where [formula] is a smooth sextic curve and P1,P2,P3,P4 are points on C, no three of which are colinear. In particular, X4 lies in the closure of X2

Let X40  ⊂  X4 be the subset of sheaves from [\ref=5.6](i) and let [formula] be the dual subset. Dualising the exact sequence [\ref=5.6](i), we see that the sheaves G giving points in [formula] are precisely the sheaves having a resolution of the form

[formula]

[formula]

where q1,q2 have no common factor. Let [formula] be the zero-dimensional subscheme of length 4 given by the equations q1  =  0,q2  =  0, let [formula] be the sextic curve given by the equation det (ψ) = 0, let JZ  ⊂  OC be the ideal sheaf of Z in C. Clearly, G≃JZ(3). Conversely, any twisted ideal sheaf JZ(3) gives a point in [formula]. Thus the generic sheaves in [formula] have the form OC(3)( - P1 - P2 - P3 - P4), where C is a somooth sextic curve and P1,P2,P3,P4 are four distinct points on C in general linear position. The first part of the proposition follows by duality.

To show that [formula] we fix a generic sheaf G  =  OC(3)( - P1 - P2 - P3 - P4) in [formula] as above and we attempt to show that this is in the closure of [formula]. We assume, in addition, that the quartic curve with equation g2  =  0 and the conic with equation q2  =  0 have at least one point of intersection, call it P5, that is distinct from Pi, 1  ≤  i  ≤  4. Choose a sixth point P6 on C distinct from the other five, that converges to P5. The sheaf E  =  OC(3)( - P1 - P2 - P3 - P4 - P5 + P6) gives a point in [formula] that converges to the point represented by G. We claim that E gives a point in [formula]. Assuming the claim to be true, we may conclude that the isomorphism class of G belongs to [formula].

It remains to show that E lies in [formula]. Write [formula], [formula], such that [formula] are linearly independent and the lines they determine meet at P5. Consider the sheaf [formula] and the zero-dimensional subscheme [formula] of length 5 supported on [formula]. We have an exact sequence

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Exactness at [formula] can be checked directly. [formula] has Hilbert polynomial 5 and contains all points of Z' in its support, hence [formula]. Thus [formula], from which we deduce that E' has resolution

[formula]

We apply the horseshoe lemma to the extension

[formula]

to the above resolution of E' and to the standard resolution of [formula] tensored with O( - 1). We obtain the exact sequence

[formula]

The above extension does not split and [formula], so we can use the argument at 2.3.2 [\cite=mult_five] to conclude that the morphism O( - 3)  →  O( - 3) in the above complex is non-zero. Cancelling O( - 3) we arrive at the resolution

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] are linearly independent one-forms. It is easy to see that the transpose of [formula] satisfies the conditions of [\ref=4.1]. In view of our hypothesis on q1 and q2, the relation [formula], [formula], u∈V*, is possible only if c1 = 0, c2  =  0. We conclude that E gives a point in [formula].

The codimension 8 stratum

The sheaves G in [formula] satisfying the condition [formula] are precisely the sheaves with resolution of the form

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] are linearly independent one-forms. These sheaves are precisely the non-split extension sheaves of the form

[formula]

where [formula] is a sextic curve and [formula] is the structure sheaf of a point.

The argument is entirely analogous to the argument at 3.1.5 [\cite=mult_five].

The sheaves G in [formula] satisfying the condition [formula] are precisely the sheaves with resolution of the form

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] does not divide q. These sheaves are precisely the extension sheaves of the form

[formula]

that do not have zero-dimensional torsion. Here [formula] is a sextic curve and [formula] is a zero-dimensional scheme of length 2.

Assume that G gives a point in [formula] and satisfies the condition [formula]. As in the proof of 2.1.3 [\cite=drezet-maican], there is an injective morphism OC  →  G( - 2), where [formula] is a curve. Clearly C has degree 6: if not, OC would destabilise G( - 2). We obtain an extension

[formula]

where C is a sheaf with support of dimension zero and length 2. It is clear that C is an extension of [formula]-modules of the form

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are the structure sheaves of two points. Let G' be the preimage of [formula] in G. This subsheaf has no zero-dimensional torsion and is an extension of [formula] by OC(2) hence, in view of [\ref=6.1], it has a resolution of the form

[formula]

Using the horseshoe lemma, we construct a resolution of G from the above resolution of G' and from the resolution

[formula]

We obtain a resolution of the form

[formula]

If the morphism O( - 3)  →  2O( - 3) were zero, then it could be shown, as in the proof of 2.3.2 [\cite=mult_five], that [formula] would be a direct summand of G. This would contradict our hypothesis. Thus we may cancel O( - 3) to get the resolution

[formula]

If the morphism 2O( - 2)  →  O( - 2) were zero, then G would have a destabilising quotient sheaf of the form OL( - 2), for a line [formula]. Thus we may cancel O( - 2) to get the resolution from the proposition. The conditions on [formula] and q follow from the semi-stability of G.

Assume now that G has a resolution as in the proposition. G has no zero-dimensional torsion because it has projective dimension 1 at every point in its support. Let [formula] be the subscheme given by the ideal [formula] and let IZ  ⊂  O be its ideal sheaf. Put [formula] and let C be the sextic curve with equation f = 0. We apply the snake lemma to the commutative diagram with exact rows

[formula]

Here i is the inclusion into the second direct summand and p is the projection onto the first direct summand. We deduce that G is an extension of OZ by OC(2).

Assume that G is an extension of OZ by OC(2) and that it has no zero-dimensional torsion. Our aim is to show that G is semi-stable. Let G'  ⊂  G be a subsheaf; denote by C' its image in OZ and put [formula]. By [\cite=maican], lemma 6.7, there is a twisted ideal sheaf A  ⊂  OC(2) containing K such that A  /  K is supported on finitely many points and OC(2) / A≃OS(2) for a curve [formula] of degree d. We may assume that 1  ≤  d  ≤  5. We can now estimate the slope of G' as in the proof of 3.1.2(ii) [\cite=mult_five]:

[formula]

We conclude that G is semi-stable, i.e. it gives a point in [formula].

The sheaves F in [formula] satisfying the condition [formula] are precisely the sheaves with resolution of the form

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] does not divide q. These are precisely the twisted ideal sheaves JZ(2), where [formula] is a zero-dimensional scheme of length 2 contained in a sextic curve C and JZ  ⊂  OC is its ideal sheaf.

The first statement follows from proposition [\ref=6.2] by duality. To prove the second statement we notice that the restriction of [formula] to O( - 1) has cokernel IZ(2), where [formula] is the subscheme given by the ideal [formula] and [formula] is its ideal sheaf. Thus F is the cokernel of the induced injective morphism O( - 4)  →  IZ(2). The sextic curve defined by the inclusion O( - 4)  ⊂  IZ(2)  ⊂  O(2) has equation [formula] and it is clear that F≃JZ(2).

Let [formula] and let [formula] be the subset of morphisms [formula] from proposition [\ref=6.3]. The linear algebraic group

[formula]

acts on [formula] by conjugation; W5 is open and invariant in [formula]. Let [formula] be the locally closed subset of isomorphism classes of cokernels of morphisms [formula].

There is a geometric quotient W5 / G5, which is a smooth projective variety. W5 / G5 is isomorphic to the Hilbert flag scheme of sextic curves in [formula] containing zero-dimensional subschemes of length 2.

The argument is entirely analogous to the argument at 2.2.5 [\cite=mult_five], where we gave three constructions for the quotient.

W5 / G5 is isomorphic to X5. In particular, X5 is a smooth closed subvariety of [formula] of codimension 8.

The canonical morphism [formula] mapping [formula] to the isomorphism class of [formula] determines a bijective morphism υ:W5 / G5  →  X5. Let H be the Hilbert flag scheme of [\ref=6.4]. Under the isomorphism H≃W5 / G5, υ maps a point (C,Z)∈H to JZ(2), where JZ  ⊂  OC is the ideal sheaf of Z in C. Our aim is to show that υ- 1 is also a morphism. For this consider the good quotient π:S  →  X5 of 2.3.2 [\cite=drezet-maican]. In view of the universal property of a good quotient, it is sufficient to show that [formula] is a morphism of varieties. For this consider the S-flat family [formula] on [formula] defined at 2.3.3 [\cite=drezet-maican]. Let [formula] be the projection onto the second factor. [formula] satisfies the hypothesis of loc.cit., hence all higher direct image sheaves [formula] are locally free on S and, moreover, for any closed point s∈S, the restriction of the Beilinson tableau of [formula] to a fibre [formula] is the Beilinson tableau (2.2.3) [\cite=drezet-maican] for [formula], which we denote [formula]. It remains to show that (C,Z) can be obtained in a natural manner from [formula], if [formula]. In other words, given a sheaf F≃JZ(2)  ⊂  OC(2) in X5, we need to construct (C,Z) starting from [formula] and performing algebraic operations. By duality, given an extension

[formula]

as at [\ref=6.2], we need to obtain (C,Z) in a natural manner from [formula]. The tableau for [formula] reads

[formula]

We have [formula] because [formula] is surjective. Denote [formula]. Consider the Euler sequence on [formula]:

[formula]

Clearly the corestriction [formula] of [formula] factors through the morphism

[formula]

We arrive at an exact sequence

[formula]

As at 2.1.4 [\cite=mult_five], it can be shown that [formula]. Canceling 3O( - 2) we get an exact sequence

[formula]

We cannot have C≃OY( - 1) for [formula] a line or a conic curve, otherwise C would destabilise G. It follows that C is the structure sheaf of a zero-dimensional subscheme in [formula] of length 2 and that [formula]. The exact sequence (2.2.5) [\cite=drezet-maican] has the form

[formula]

Denote [formula]. From (2.2.4) [\cite=drezet-maican] we get the resolution

[formula]

[formula]

Here [formula] is a lift of [formula]. We have [formula], hence [formula]. The global sections of G generate OC(2) and G' is generated by global sections. Thus G' = OC(2). The maximal minors of any matrix representing [formula] generate the ideal of C because the Fitting support of G' is C. It is also clear that C is isomorphic to OZ.

In conclusion, we have obtained the pair (C,Z)∈H from [formula] by performing algebraic operations.

X5 lies in the closure of X3 and also in the closure of X4.

According to [\ref=6.3], the generic points in X5 are stable-equivalence classes of sheaves of the form OC(2)( - P1 - P2), where [formula] is a smooth sextic curve and P1,P2 are distinct points on C. Choose points P3,P4 on C such that P1,P2,P3 are non-colinear, P4 is distinct from them and converges to P3. According to [\ref=5.3], the sheaf OC(2)( - P1 - P2 - P3 + P4) gives a point in X3. This point converges to the stable-equivalence class of OC(2)( - P1 - P2). Thus [formula].

If P1 and P2 are generic enough, then the line they determine meets C at four other distinct points Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4. Choose points Pi' on C converging to Qi, 1  ≤  i  ≤  4, such that no three of them are colinear. According to [\ref=5.8], the sheaf OC(1)(P1' + P2' + P3' + P4') gives a point in X4. This point converges to the stable-equivalence class of OC(1)(Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4)≃OC(2)( - P1 - P2). Thus [formula].

The moduli space is a union of the strata

In the final section we shall prove that there are no other sheaves giving points in [formula] beside the sheaves we have discussed so far.

There are no sheaves F giving points in [formula] and satisfying the conditions [formula] and [formula].

By duality, we must show that there are no sheaves G giving points in [formula] and satisfying the conditions [formula], [formula]. Consider a sheaf G on [formula] with Hilbert polynomial [formula] and satisfying the above cohomological conditions. Put [formula]. As in the proof of [\ref=5.6], the Beilinson free monad leads to the resolution

[formula]

Here [formula], [formula], hence G maps surjectively onto the cokernel C of the morphism [formula]. Thus C has rank zero, forcing m = 3. The Hilbert polynomial of C is [formula], which shows that C is a destabilising quotient sheaf of G. Thus G cannot give a point in [formula].

There are no sheaves F giving points in [formula] and satisfying the cohomological conditions

[formula]

Assume that F gives a point in [formula] and satisfies the condition [formula]. Write [formula], [formula]. We will examine two cases, according to the value of [formula]. Assume first that [formula]. The Beilinson free monad for F reads

[formula]

[formula]

and yields a resolution

[formula]

in which [formula]. From the injectivity of [formula] we see that [formula]. Thus

[formula]

forcing [formula].

Assume next that [formula]. The Beilinson free monad for the dual sheaf [formula] reads

[formula]

and yields the resolution

[formula]

hence the resolution

[formula]

As in the proof of 2.1.4 [\cite=mult_five], the map (p + 1)O( - 2)  →  3O( - 2) has rank 3, hence we may cancel 3O( - 2) to get the exact sequence

[formula]

Since G maps surjectively onto the cokernel C of the morphism

[formula]

we have m - 3  ≤  p - 1. Moreover, if m - 3  =  p - 1, then C has Hilbert polynomial [formula], hence C destabilises G. Thus we have the inequality m  ≤  p + 1. According to [\cite=maican-duality], lemma 3, we may dualise the above resolution to get a monad for F of the form

[formula]

[formula]

This yields the resolution

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

forcing [formula].

There are no sheaves F giving points in [formula] and satisfying the cohomological condition [formula].

Assume that there is F as in the proposition. Write [formula], [formula]. The Beilinson free monad for F reads

[formula]

As in the proof of 3.2.5 [\cite=mult_five], we can show that m  ≥  6 and that ξ is equivalent to the morphism represented by the matrix

[formula]

We recall that the argument is based on the fact that there is no non-zero morphism OL(1)  →  F for any line [formula]. According to [\cite=maican-duality], lemma 3, taking duals of the locally free sheaves in the above monad yields a monad for the dual of F. This monad gives the following resolution for the sheaf [formula]:

[formula]

This further leads to the resolution

[formula]

Since G maps surjectively onto the cokernel C of the morphism

[formula]

we have m  ≤  p + 3. Moreover, if m  =  p + 3, then C has Hilbert polynomial [formula], hence C destabilises G. We deduce that m  ≤  p + 2. As m  ≥  6, we have p  ≥  4. As above, the dual monad for F takes the form

[formula]

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

forcing [formula]. According to [\ref=6.3], this is impossible.

Let F be a sheaf giving a point in [formula]. Then [formula] or 1.

Assume that F gives a point in [formula] and satisfies the condition [formula]. As in the proof of 2.1.3 [\cite=drezet-maican], there is an injective morphism OC  →  F( - 1) for a curve [formula]. From the semi-stability of F we see that C has degree 5 or 6. In the first case F( - 1) / OC has Hilbert polynomial [formula] and has no zero-dimensional torsion. Indeed, the pull-back in F( - 1) of any non-zero subsheaf of F( - 1) / OC supported on finitely many points would destabilise F( - 1). We deduce that F( - 1) / OC is isomorphic to OL( - 1) for a line [formula], hence [formula].

Assume now that C is a sextic curve. The quotient sheaf C  =  F( - 1) / OC has support of dimension zero and length 4. Assume that [formula]. Then, in view of [\ref=7.3], we have [formula]. We claim that there is a global section s of F( - 1) such that its image in C generates a subsheaf isomorphic to OZ, where [formula] is a zero-dimensional scheme of length 1, 2 or 3. Indeed, as [formula] and [formula] is assumed to be at least 3, there are global sections s1 and s2 of F( - 1) such that their images in C are linearly independent. It is easy to see that there exists a subsheaf C'  ⊂  C of length 3. Choose [formula], not both zero, such that the image of c1s1  +  c2s2 under the composite map F( - 1)  →  C  →  C  /  C' is zero. Then s = c1s1  +  c2s2 satisfies our requirements.

Let F'  ⊂  F( - 1) be the preimage of OZ. Assume first that Z is not contained in a line, so, in particular, it has length 3. According to [\cite=modules-alternatives], proposition 4.5, we have a resolution

[formula]

We apply the horseshoe lemma to the extension

[formula]

to the standard resolution of OC and to the resolution of OZ from above. We obtain the exact sequence

[formula]

As the morphism 2O( - 3)  →  O( - 6) in the above complex is zero and as [formula], we can show, as in the proof of 2.3.2 [\cite=mult_five], that OZ is a direct summand of F'. This is absurd, by hypothesis F( - 1) has no zero-dimensional torsion. The same argument applies if Z is contained in a line and has length 3, except that this time we use the resolution

[formula]

The cases when Z has length 1 or 2 are analogous. We conclude that [formula].
