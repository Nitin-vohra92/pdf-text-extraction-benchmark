[formula]

A proposed modification of the dinamic subgrid scale closure method

A popular choice for modelling turbulence subgrid tensor τij consists of introducing the concept of "eddy viscosity" νturb:

[formula]

where [formula] is the shear stress filtered on the scale Δ. The quantity νturb characterizes the turbulence. Its order of magnitude is given by the product of a length times a velocity characteristic of the turbulent motion: νturb  ~  l  ·  Vl. Choosing the length equal to the computational grid, l = Δ, and [formula], we obtain the Smagorinsky model [\cite=sma63]:

[formula]

The quantity C can be calculated dynamically from the Germano identity:

[formula]

which furnishes:

[formula]

The behaviour of the parameterization ([\ref=ckol]) is very similar to the dynamic Smagorinsky model formulated in [\cite=lil92]. Hence the tensor given by equation ([\ref=ckol]) is:

[formula]

In order to eliminate the constrain that τij is parallel to Sij, we propose the following parameterization:

[formula]

where [formula] is a quantity representative of the strain-rate (for instance one invariant of the tensor [formula]). The tensor components Cij are calculated from Germano's identity directly, without introducing the concept of eddy viscosity, wheras the scalar quantity c is the one that better reproduce the dissipation energy. Combining ([\ref=taunos]) and ([\ref=germano]) we obtain:

[formula]

Assuming that C(2Δ)ij = C(Δ)ij and ≃Cij, we have:

[formula]

[formula]

In order to calculate c we multiply eq.([\ref=l4]) by ij and assume that the following relationship is valid for the average quantities:

[formula]

Using the above relationship we have:

[formula]

Hence the tensor τij becomes:

[formula]

and assuming [formula] we obtain the final form:

[formula]

We can see that the tensor ([\ref=tnos]) contains the first term that is similar to the tensor predicted by similarity models [\cite=bardina]:

[formula]

and a second term similar to the dynamic Smagorinsky models such as ([\ref=taunos1]). However, in the case of ([\ref=tnos]), the term proportional to Lij derives from the Germano identity directly. It is well-known from the literature, that similarity models better reproduce the SG tensor components, whereas models based on the concept of eddy viscosity ([\ref=eddy]), such as dynamic Smagorinsky model, better reproduce dissipated energy [\cite=menyeu96]. Tensor ([\ref=tnos]) may be able to better reproduce both SG tensor components and dissipated energy.
