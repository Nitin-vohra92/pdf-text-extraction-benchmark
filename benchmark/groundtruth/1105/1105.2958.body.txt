Harnack Inequalities for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Processes Driven by Lévy Processes

Main Results

The dimension free Harnack inequality for diffusion semigroups was first established in (Wang, 1997) under a curvature condition. Using the coupling method and Girsanov transformations, this inequality has been derived in (Arnaudon et al., 2006) for diffusions with curvature unbounded below, also see e.g. (Wang, 2007, 2010b; Ouyang, 2009) and references therein for recent work on this topic. These methods are applied in (Röckner and Wang, 2003; Ouyang et al., 2011) to study Harnack inequalities for a class of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type processes driven by Lévy process with non-degenerate Gaussian noise on Hilbert spaces. In this paper we will establish explicit Harnack inequalities for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes driven by pure Lévy jump processes. For this aim, we will make full use of the existing estimates of density functions for Lévy processes.

Let Lt be a d-dimensional Lévy process starting from the origin and A be a d  ×  d matrix. The corresponding Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is defined as the unique strong solution of the stochastic differential equation

[formula]

Denote by Pt the semigroup of Xt, and by [formula] the set of all bounded and nonnegative measurable functions on [formula]. Our main contribution is as follows:

Assume that the Lévy measure of Lt satisfies

[formula]

where α∈(0,2) and c > 0. Then there exists C > 0 (only depending on d, α, c and [formula]) such that for any t > 0, x, [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

If moreover A = 0, then

We shall point out that the above type of Harnack inequality does not hold for Brownian motion. That is, let Pt be the semigroup of Brownian motion on [formula]. Then, there does not exist a finite measurable function Φ on [formula] such that for any t > 0, x, [formula] and [formula], Indeed, such inequality is not true for most diffusion semigroups on noncompact manifolds, e.g. see (Wang, 2006a).

By the Hölder inequality, Theorem [\ref=section1th1] immediately yields the following result, which indicates that F.-Y. Wang's Harnack inequalities hold for rotationally invariant symmetric α-stable Lévy processes with α∈(0,2) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes driven by rotationally invariant symmetric α-stable Lévy process.

Under the condition in Theorem [\ref=section1th1], there exists a constant C > 0 such that for any t > 0, p > 1, x, [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

If moreover A = 0, then

[formula]

Comparing with (Gordina et al., 2011, Theorem 1.1) where a dimension free Harnack inequality is presented for α∈(1,2), the advantage of our results is that they hold for any [formula] and α∈(0,2). On the other hand, however, our results are dimension-dependent so that they can not be extended to infinite dimensions. Next, (Gordina et al., 2011, Theorem 1.4) includes a dimension-free log-Harnack inequality for α∈(0,1]. Below we present a simpler but dimension-dependent version of this inequality for a truncated α-stable Lévy process. We refer to (Bobkov et al., 2001; Wang, 2010a) for the background and some properties of logarithmic Harnack inequalities.

Assume that the Lévy measure of Lt satisfies where α∈(0,2) and c, r∈(0,  ∞  ). Let Pt be the semigroup of Lt. Then there exists C > 0 (only depending on d, α, c and r) such that for any t > 0, x, [formula] and [formula] with [formula],

[formula]

Note   The classical Harnack's inequality is an inequality relating the values of a positive harmonic function at two points. In this paper, we also call [\eqref=section1th1222] or [\eqref=section1th12223333] the Harnack inequality. The notation, different from the classical one, is due to Prof. F.-Y. Wang's work. The readers can refer to the survey paper (Wang, 2006b) for more details of Wang's Harnack inequality.

Proofs

The idea of the proofs of Theorems [\ref=section1th1] and [\ref=section1th2] is to compare the original process with rotationally invariant symmetric α-stable Lévy processes and with rotationally invariant symmetric truncated α-stable Lévy processes, respectively.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=section1th1]

We first present some preliminary results concerning rotationally invariant symmetric α-stable Lévy process Xt, which is a pure jump Lévy process on [formula] with Lévy measure

[formula]

where c > 0 and α∈(0,2).

According to (Blumenthal and Getoor, 1960, Theorem 2.1), we know that the process Xt has a continuous density function pt(x,y), and there exist constants c1 and c2 > 0 that depend only on d, α and the constant c in [\eqref=st1] such that for all x, [formula] and t > 0,

[formula]

The following result is based on [\eqref=st2], and it is a key in the proof of Theorem [\ref=section1th1].

Let pt(x,y) be the density function of the rotationally invariant symmetric α-stable Lévy process Xt above. Then, for any t > 0 and x, y, [formula],

[formula]

(i) When |y - z|  ≤  t1 / α,

[formula]

and so

[formula]

Then,

[formula]

(ii) If [formula], then

[formula]

We get

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

(iii) If [formula] and |y - z| > t1 / α, then

[formula]

So,

[formula]

Noticing that in this case

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Combining with all the estimates above, we can arrive at [\eqref=st3]. The proof is completed.

Having Lemma [\ref=levt] at hand, we can easily obtain the following statement for rotationally invariant symmetric α-stable Lévy processes.

Let Pt be the semigroup of the rotationally invariant symmetric α-stable Lévy process Xt above. Then there exists C > 0 such that for any t > 0, x, [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

Let P(t,x,dz) be the transition probability function of Xt. We find that for any [formula] and x, [formula],

[formula]

The proof is completed.

According to the proof of Proposition [\ref=levtsss], the inequality [\eqref=strongharnack] is an consequence of [\eqref=st2]. Thus, [\eqref=strongharnack] is also satisfied for symmetric (not necessarily rotationally invariant) α-stable Lévy processes, see e.g. (Bogdan et al., 2003).

Next, we turn to the proof of Theorem [\ref=section1th1].

(1) We first assume that A = 0. Since ν(dz)  ≥  c|z|- d - αdz, we can write

[formula]

where XSt is a rotationally invariant symmetric α-stable Lévy process with Lévy measure

[formula]

and Xt' is a Lévy process with Lévy measure

[formula]

Let Pt, PSt and P't be the semigroups of the Lévy processes Xt, XSt and Xt', respectively. Then, according to Proposition [\ref=levtsss], there exists C > 0 such that for any t > 0, x, [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

Therefore, for t > 0, x, [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

where in the above inequality we have used the fact that [formula]. The desired assertion [\eqref=section1th122222] follows.

(2) Suppose that [formula]. We borrow an idea from the proof of (Wang, 2011, Theorem 1.1). It is well known that for the semigroup of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process

[formula]

where μt is the probability measure on [formula] with characteristic function

[formula]

and Φ is the symbol of the Lévy process Lt, cf. see (Jacob, 2001). Define

[formula]

Then, following Part (III) in the proof of (Wang, 2011, Theorem 1.1), for any s∈(0,1],

[formula]

is a Lévy symbol. Thus, for every t∈(0,1] there exists a probability measure πt on [formula] with

[formula]

Let PSt be the semigroup for the Lévy process with symbol c0c|ξ|α, and define

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Note that PSt is also the semigroup of a rotationally invariant symmetric α-stable Lévy process with Lévy measure

[formula]

Then the required assertion for t∈(0,1] follows form the arguments in step (1).

For any t > 0 and [formula],

[formula]

where in the inequality above we have used again the fact that [formula]. The proof is end.

To end up this section, we further present two remarks about Theorem [\ref=section1th1].

(1) The proof of Theorem [\ref=section1th1] yields that [\eqref=section1th1222] and [\eqref=section1th12223333] hold for the following two classes of Lévy type processes: (i) Stable-like processes on [formula], whose Lévy jump kernel is given by [formula] and c(x,y) is a symmetric function on [formula] that is bounded upper and below by two positive constants. More details about stable-like processes are referred to (Chen and Kumagai, 2003, Theorem 1.1) and (Chen and Kumagai, 2008, Theorem 1.2). (ii) Markov processes on [formula] generated by [formula], where 1 < α < 2 and b in the Kato class [formula] on [formula]. The readers can see (Bogdan and Jakubowski, 2007, Theorem 2) for the comparability between the transition density for the small time of these processes and that of rotationally invariant symmetric α-stable Lévy processes.

(2) As shown in (Wang, 1997, 2006b, 2007, 2010a), to derive contractivity properties of the semigroup from the Harnack inequality, one needs concentration properties of the associated invariant measure, which is however unknown for the present setting.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=section1th2]

We begin with recalling some results about a rotationally invariant symmetric truncated α-stable Lévy process Xt. The corresponding Lévy measure is given by where c, r∈(0,  ∞  ) and α∈(0,2). Let pt(x,y) be the density function of Xt. Then, according to (Chen et al., 2008, Proposition 2.1 and Theorems 2.3 and 3.6), there exist positive constants ci > 0 [formula] such that for any t∈(0,1] and x, [formula] with |x - y|  ≤  1,

[formula]

and for any t∈(0,1] and x, [formula] with |x - y| > 1,

[formula]

Moreover, by (Chen et al., 2008, Proposition 2.2), there also exists a constant c7 > 0 such that for any t∈(0,1] and x, [formula],

[formula]

Let pt(x,y) be the density function of the rotationally invariant symmetric truncated α-stable Lévy process Xt above. Then, there are two positive constants C1 and C2 such that for any 0 < t  ≤  1, x, y and [formula],

[formula]

Fix t∈(0,1]. When |y - z|  ≤  t1 / α, by [\eqref=tden1],

[formula]

Thus, according to [\eqref=tden3],

[formula]

Similarly, when t1 / α  <  |y - z|  ≤  1,

[formula]

which implies that

[formula]

Furthermore, by [\eqref=tden2] and [\eqref=tden3], if |y - z|  ≥  1, then

[formula]

In particular, when [formula],

[formula]

Combining with all the estimates above, for any 0 < t  ≤  1, x, y and [formula], It follows our desired assertion.

Let Pt be the semigroup of the rotationally invariant symmetric truncated α-stable Lévy process Xt above. Then for any t > 0, x, [formula] and [formula] with [formula],

[formula]

(1) For any [formula] with f  ≥  1 and t > 0,

[formula]

where in the above inequality we have used the following Young inequality: for any probability measure μ, if g, h  ≥  0 with μ(g) = 1, then

[formula]

(2) According to [\eqref=st3ttt4444], for any 0 < t  ≤  1 and x, y, [formula],

[formula]

On the other hand, if [formula], then

[formula]

and so, by [\eqref=tden2],

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

(3) For t∈(0,1], the required assertion follows from [\eqref=proftrstable1] and [\eqref=proftrstable2]. For any t > 0 and [formula] with f  ≥  1,

[formula]

where the first inequality follows from the Jensen inequality: for any probability measure μ and [formula], μ( log f)  ≤   log μ(f), and in the second inequality we have used the fact that [formula] and the conclusion for t∈(0,1] proved in the previous two steps. We have proved our desired assertion.

By the proof of Proposition [\ref=levtsss4545], the inequality [\eqref=logstrongharnack] is based on estimates [\eqref=tden1], [\eqref=tden2] and [\eqref=tden3]. Therefore, [\eqref=logstrongharnack] also holds for Lévy type processes, whose Lévy jump kernel is given by [formula]. Here, r∈(0,  ∞  ) and c(x,y) is a symmetric function on [formula] that is bounded upper and below by two positive constants, see e.g. (Chen et al., 2008).

We finally turn to the proof of Theorem [\ref=section1th2].

Under the condition in Theorem [\ref=section1th2], we can write

[formula]

where XTt is a rotationally invariant symmetric truncated α-stable Lévy process with Lévy measure

[formula]

and Xt' is a Lévy process with Lévy measure

[formula]

Let Pt, PTt and P't be the semigroups of the Lévy processes Xt, XTt and Xt', respectively. Then, according to Proposition [\ref=levtsss4545], there exists C > 0 such that for any t > 0, x, [formula] and [formula] with [formula],

[formula]

Therefore, for t > 0 and [formula] with [formula],

[formula]

where in the above two inequalities we have used the Jensen inequality and the fact that [formula], respectively. The proof is complete.
