Estimation of SM backgrounds to SUSY searches in the 1-lepton + jets + channel

Introduction

Supersymmetric extensions (SUSY) to the Standard Model (SM) predict the existence of supersymmetric particles which could be produced in the proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV at the LHC [\cite=LHCcol]. The search for SUSY is one of the main aims of the ATLAS experiment [\cite=ATLASexp].

The main production channels of SUSY particles at the LHC are squark-(anti)squark, gluino-squark and gluino-gluino pairs if these sparticles are light enough. Typical squark and gluino decays contain isolated leptons, quarks and gluons (which result in jets) and end with the stable Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) if a R-parity conserving SUSY model is assumed. As the LSP escapes the detector undetected, missing transverse energy ([formula]) will be observed. Therefore, the typical experimental signature consists of multiple jets, isolated leptons and [formula]. Here only final states with one isolated muon or electron, at least three jets and [formula] are considered (1-lepton + ≥   3jets + [formula] channel).

However, other physical processes can have similar experimental signatures, in particular:

t events with a semileptonic decay topology, where each top quark decays into a W-boson and a b-quark, with one of the W-bosons decaying into an isolated charged lepton and a neutrino ([formula]).

W+jets events where the W-boson decays into a neutrino and the corresponding charged lepton.

QCD events, like heavy flavor (b or c quarks) decays, events with photon conversions or jets which were reconstructed as isolated leptons.

A signal region rich in SUSY signal events but poor in background events (BG) which was motivated by studies on Monte Carlo event samples is defined as follows. Hereby, the channel itself is defined by asking for exactly one isolated lepton being in the event with a transverse momentum of [formula] which already reduces the QCD BG. Furthermore, the event must contain at least three jets with [formula] and [formula]. In addition to these cuts, various cuts are applied to reject background events: a further reduction of the QCD background is achieved by asking for the three leading jets and [formula] not to point in the same direction . Furthermore, only events with [formula] and a high transverse mass with [formula] are selected. The last cut reduces the W+jets and t backgrounds considerably as illustrated in figure [\ref=fig:mtcut]. Finally, a cut on the effective mass with [formula] is applied. After applying these cuts, t events are the main background and QCD events are heavily suppressed.

The estimation of the three most important backgrounds in the signal region is discussed in the following.

W and top backgrounds

The magnitude of the backgrounds is estimated with the help of background dominated control regions. In figure [\ref=fig:control], various control regions - one for each of the main backgrounds (QCD, t, W+jets) in the [formula] - [formula] plane are defined. All other cuts for these control regions correspond to the usual selection cuts presented above except the cut on [formula] which is not applied. For example, the QCD region (QR) which is defined by [formula] and [formula] is rich in QCD events. The control region with medium [formula] and [formula] values ([formula] and [formula]) is dominated by top and W+jets events. This control region is further divided into two control regions dominated by t events (top region, TR) or W+jets events (W region, WR), respectively, by the requirement of finding at least one b-tagged jet (TR) or no b-tagged jet (WR) in the three leading jets. The QR is only used to estimate the QCD contamination in the TR or in the WR, whereas the QCD BG in the signal region itself is obtained with the method described in the next section. In contrast, the t and W+jets BG in the signal region is obtained by extrapolating the number of measured W and top events in W and T control regions (other backgrounds were subtracted) into the signal region. For this an extrapolation factor which is obtained from Monte Carlo is used. The extrapolation is illustrated in equation [\ref=eq:extrapolation] for the top background.

This method is validated by comparing data to MC in the relevant distributions for the extrapolation. Figure [\ref=fig:meff_distributions] shows for example the [formula] distributions in the TR and in the WR in the muon channel. The good agreement between data and MC gives confidence in the method.

QCD background

In contrast to the W and top backgrounds, the QCD background is estimated by a matrix method. As mentioned above, the signal selection cuts (tight selection cuts) choose only events with exactly one isolated lepton. By relaxing the isolation requirement for the lepton a loose control sample enriched with QCD events can be defined. The events passing the tight selection cuts can be expressed as the sum of QCD events ("fake") and non-QCD events ("real") as in equation [\ref=eq:QCDtight].

[formula]

In the same way, the events passing the loose but not the tight selection cuts can be written as the sum of QCD and non-QCD events. By defining two efficiencies by [formula] this sum can be written as:

[formula]

Both equations [\ref=eq:QCDtight] and [\ref=eq:QCDloose] are solved for the QCD events passing the tight selection cuts in equation [\ref=eq:QCDest]. The result gives the QCD events in the SUSY signal region.

[formula]

This method was applied to the whole dataset of 2010 of 35 ~  in the electron and in the muon channel, respectively. Thus, [formula] was obtained in a QCD dominated control region with [formula] and [formula], whereas [formula] was taken from Monte Carlo. Only an upper limit on the QCD background in the signal region could be derived with <  0.5 events in the muon channel and <  0.3 events in the electron channel due to low statistics in the loose-but-not-tight events.

Outlook

The QCD, t and W+jets backgrounds in the signal region are estimated with the methods presented. Other backgrounds are taken from simulation. The final results are detailed in table [\ref=table:results_1lepton]. The top background is with 1.76 ±   0.67 (muon channel) and 1.34 ±   0.52 (electron channel) the most dominant background in the signal region. In total, 2.25  ±  0.94 background events are expected in the muon channel and 1.81  ±  0.75 background events in the electron channel, but only 1 event passes all the signal selection cuts presented above in each of the electron and the muon channels. An interpretation of the results in terms of limits is given elsewhere [\cite=1-lepton_paper].
