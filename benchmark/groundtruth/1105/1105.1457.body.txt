An estimate for Frobenius' diophantine problem in three dimensions

Key words: Frobenius problem, linear diophantine equations, diophantine approximation

MSC-index: 11D04

Let a,b,c be integers. The Frobenius problem is to determine the greatest integer n which cannot be represented as positive linear combination of a,b,c; this integer will henceforth be denoted by f(a,b,c). Of course, if a,b,c have a common divisor m  ≥  2, an integer not divisible by m cannot be represented as integral linear combination of a, b, and c, we will therefore suppose that (a,b,c) = 1.

Beck, Einstein and Zacks[\cite=BEZ] conjectured that, apart from certain explicit families of exceptions, we have f(a,b,c)  ≤  (abc)5 / 8. They supported their conjuecture by an impressive amount of numerical data and stated that counterexamples are not to be expected unless a,b,c are close to some arithmetic progression. However, in this note we will show that their conjecture fails for somewhat generic examples, while it holds true for the vast majority of triples. We do so by using diophantine approximations inspired by the circle method. The idea to use such an approach is already present in the work of Beck, Diaz and Robins[\cite=BDR], however, it has not yet been fully exploited. Define Na(b,c) to be the least integer n such that for every integer x the congruence [formula] is solvable with 0  ≤  ν,μ  ≤  n. The basic relations between the functions f and N are summarized as follows.

Let a,b,c be positive integers satisfying (a,b,c) = 1.

We have

[formula]

Suppose that (a,b) = 1. Denote by [formula] the modular inverse of b modulo a. Then we have [formula].

Suppose that (p,q) = 1 and

[formula]

Then

[formula]

(i) In every residue class modulo a there exists an element x which can be represented as x = bν + cμ with 0  ≤  ν,μ  ≤  Na(b,c), in particular, x  ≤  (b + c)Na(b,c). Hence, every integer n  ≥  (b + c)Na(b,c) can be written as n = aα + bν + cμ with α  ≥  0 and 0  ≤  ν,μ  ≤  Na(b,c), thus, f(a,b,c)  ≤  (b + c)Na(b,c). Conversely, there exists an integer x such that the congruence [formula] is unsolvable with 0  ≤  ν,μ  ≤  Na(b,c) - 1, that is, every element in this class which is representable by a,b,c can only be represented using Na(b,c) summands b or c, and is therefore of size at least min (b,c)Na(b,c), that is, f(a,b,c)  ≥   min (b,c)Na(b,c).

(ii) Our claim follows immediately from the fact that [formula] is equivalent to [formula].

(iii) Define the integers [formula] by the relation [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

hence, every residue class x modulo a can be written as [formula] with [formula] and μ  ≤  q - 1, hence, [formula]. Together with (ii), the upper bound follows. For the lower bound suppose without loss that [formula], and consider [formula]. We claim that x cannot be represented with less than [formula] summands modulo a. Suppose first that [formula]. Then [formula], and no multiple [formula] with [formula], [formula] falls in the range

[formula]

, or satisfies [formula], which implies the lower bound in this case as well.

From this result we draw the following conclusion:

Choose b∈[a,2a] subject to the condition (a,b) = 1, then choose c∈[a,2a] such that [formula]. The proposition implies that [formula], whereas the upper bound follows from f(a,b,c)  ≤  f(a,b)  ≤  2a2. Since there are φ(a) choices for b, and at least half of them satisfy [formula], our first claim follows. For the second claim it suffices to prove that for every α,β∈[0,1] there exist integers b∈[(1  +  α)a,(1  +  α   +   ε)a] and c∈[(1  +  β)a,(1  +  β   +   ε)a], such that [formula]. However, this follows immediatelly from Weil's estimate for Kloosterman sums[\cite=Weil] together with the Erd os-Turán-Koksma inequality (cf., e.g., [\cite=KN]). Finally, let δ > 0 be fixed, and set Q = a1 / 2 + δ. For every real number α∈[0,1] there exists some q  ≤  Q, such that [formula]. Denote by [formula] the set of all α∈[0,1], such that [formula] does not hold for any q∈[a1  /  2  -  δ,a1  /  2  +  δ]. Then [formula] consists of a1 - 2δ intervals of total measure bounded above by

[formula]

thus, there are O(a1 - 2δ) integers ν, such that Na(1,ν)  ≥  a1 / 2 + δ, and our claim follows.
