Introduction

Low mass X-ray binaries (LMXB) containing weakly magnetised neutron stars (NS) are classified into Z and Atoll sources [\citep=Has89] [\citep=Van06]. The classification is based upon the different tracks these two types of sources trace in the colour-colour diagrams (CD) and their associated timing properties in the different spectral states. Even though detailed timing and spectral differences between the two class of sources are not completely explained, higher accretion rate is generally believed to characterise the Z as compared to the Atoll sources. Atoll sources have lower luminosities ( 0.001-0.5 LEdd) than Z sources and they have fragmented CD consisting of banana state (BS) and Extreme island state (EIS). There is also a transitional state between these two states referred to as Island state. In the BS the source luminosity is high and the observed energy spectrum is soft (high/soft state). On the other hand in the EIS the source luminosity is low and the observed energy spectrum is hard (low/hard state).

Irrespective of the type of source, there are two different approaches to model their energy spectra, both consisting of a soft/thermal and a hard/Comptonized component [\citep=Bar01]. In one approach the accretion disk is considered to be emitting the soft thermal component while the boundary layer emits the hard Comptonised component [\citep=Mit89]. In the other approach, the boundary layer emits the soft thermal component and the inner hot accretion disk emits the hard Comptonised component of the spectrum [\citep=Whi88]. To distinguish between these two approaches good quality broadband spectral data is required. Beppo-SAX broadband (0.1-200 keV) observations show that Eastern-like models are preferred for several NS-LMXB [\citep=Gua98] [\citep=Lav04] [\citep=Tar08].

Suzaku observations cover a broad energy range of 0.7-70 keV with good spectral resolution. This capability of Suzaku allows to distinguish between several modelling approaches for NS-LMXBs: Eastern-like, as in the case of the Z-source LMC X-2 [\citep=Agr09]; Western-like, as in the case of the periodic burster XB1323-619 [\citep=Bal09]; scattered-in dust emission plus direct NS and/or disk blackbody emission, as for the eclipsing LMXB SAXJ1745.6-2901 [\citep=Hyo09].

Aql X-1 is a recurrent soft transient LMXB with an optical companion star of V = 21.6 K7V spectral type [\citep=Che99] and orbital period 18.9 hours [\citep=Wel00]. The distance to the source is estimated to be anywhere between 4 kpc to 6.5 kpc [\citep=Rut01]. The recurrent transient X-ray outbursts observed are thought to occur due to thermal instabilities in the accretion disk [\citep=Van96]. In Aql X-1 the typical outburst recurrence time is 200 days, with average durations of 40-60 days [\citep=Sim02]. The source also shows Type-I X-ray bursts which are believed to be run away thermonuclear burning of the matter accreted onto the surface of the NS [\citep=Lew95] [\citep=Bil98]. High frequency quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs) between 750-830 Hz and burst oscillations have also been discovered in this source [\citep=Zha98]. Recently an episode of coherent pulsations at 550.27 Hz lasting for 150s was discovered during the peak of the 1998 outburst [\citep=Cas08]. The occurrence of Type-I bursts, burst oscillations and the coherent pulsations in Aql X-1 confirm that the compact object is a rapidly spinning neutron star. [\cite=Rei04] analysed five X-ray outbursts of Aql X-1 observed using RXTE-PCA between 1997 February to 2002 May. They conclude from their timing and spectral studies that this is an Atoll source.

Here we study the broad band spectrum of Aql X-1 using the pointed Suzaku and Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) observations.

Observation and analysis

Aql X-1 went into outburst during August 2007 and was observed using Suzaku [\citep=Mit07] and RXTE [\citep=Jah96]. The source flux increased from ~  10 mCrab to ~  0.2 Crab during the outburst before it finally decays to a flux of ~  5 mCrab. Figure [\ref=fig:asm-lc] shows the one day averaged RXTE All Sky Monitor [\citep=Lev96] light curve of this outburst. Seven pointed observations are made using Suzaku. The X-ray Imaging Spectrometer [\citep=Koy07] was operated in the 1/4 window mode during all observations. An additional 0.5s burst option was used during the first observation (Obs Id 402053010). Since all these observations were done after November 9, 2006 no XIS2 data are available. Hard X-ray Detector [\citep=Tak07] observations were done with XIS nominal pointing. For the last two Suzaku observations the count rates are low and the spectra obtained from XIS and HXD have poor statistics. The fifth Suzaku observation data could not be analysed since the attitude file provided by the HEASARC site is corrupted. Hence these three observations are not used for the work presented here. For more details see Table [\ref=tab:table1].

There are 16 pointed RXTE Proportional Counter Array (PCA) observations between 54360 MJD and 54400 MJD, seven during the peak of the outburst and nine after the decay of the outburst (Figure [\ref=fig:asm-lc]). Three of the PCA observations are simultaneous to the second, third and fourth Suzaku observations (Table [\ref=tab:table1]). In the following subsections we give the analysis details of data reduction for RXTE PCA and Suzaku respectively.

RXTE-PCA

PCA data are used to create the CD of Aql X-1 for the 2007 outburst. To normalise the Aql X-1 colours by Crab colours we used the three PCA Crab observations between 54360 MJD and 54400 MJD. Background subtracted lightcurves of Aql X-1 and Crab were extracted using Std2 mode data in energy bands 3.0-4.5 keV, 4.5-6.0 keV, 6.0-9.7 keV, 9.7-16.0 keV with 16s time resolution. To eliminate artifacts that may arise due to different gain corrections for the different PCUs only photons collected in the third PCU were used since this PCU was on during all the observations. The Soft colour (SC) is defined as the ratio of count rates in energy bands 4.5-6.0 keV and 3.0-4.5 keV and the Hard colour (HC) as the ratio of count rates in energy bands 9.7-16.0 keV and 6.0-9.7 keV. Average Crab colours obtained are SC = 1.986  ±  0.002 and HC = 0.5992  ±  0.0007. Figure [\ref=fig:cd] is the CD obtained by plotting normalised Aql X-1 HC versus SC. All normalised Aql X-1 colours having error greater than 5% of the observed colour were ignored. This amounted in rejecting 14 out of 307 points of the CD. From Figure [\ref=fig:cd] we conclude that during the second, third and fourth Suzaku observations, Aql X-1 was in the EIS [\citep=Rei04] We will refer to these three Suzaku observations as EI1, EI2, EI3 respectively. It is noted that EI2 observation has the best statistics in the EIS and also EI2 is brighter than EI1 indicating irregular decline in the lightcurve (Table [\ref=tab:table1]).

There are no simultaneous PCA observations during the first Suzaku observation to ascertain the spectral state of the source. Hence we use a different method to find the normalised Aql X-1 SC and HC during this observation. The best fit spectral model that can reproduce the observed Suzaku spectrum is used to simulate a PCA spectrum. The fakeit command of XSPEC package is used for this simulation. Average count rates in the four energy bands required to calculate the SC and HC are obtained by this simulated PCA spectrum. Aql X-1 SC and HC thus obtained are normalised by the average Crab SC and HC respectively. In figure [\ref=fig:cd] the point marked by an open plus sign with error bars represents this normalised Aql X-1 SC and HC. Thus we conclude that during the first Suzaku observation, Aql X-1 was in the BS. Henceforth this observation will be referred to as the BS observation.

The PCA spectra from simultaneous observations (Table [\ref=tab:table1]) are used for comparison with the Suzaku spectra. We have used the Std2 spectra and response files provided in the standard products. Energy channels were appropriately regrouped before the final spectral fitting.

Suzaku

For each front-illuminated XIS detector (XIS0 and XIS3) we extracted the source spectra using a 260 arc-sec circular extraction region centered on the source. The energy scale is reprocessed using the xispi task. Background spectra are extracted using appropriate circular regions outside the source region. Corresponding response files are generated using the xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen tools. The spectra from respective XIS0 and XIS3 detectors are then added together using the addascaspec tool.

During high count rates, as is the case for the BS observation, there is a possibility of pile-up in the XIS detectors. To check for pile-up we extracted the source spectrum from an annular region with inner radius of 40 arc-sec and an outer radius of 260 arc-sec. Corresponding response files were also generated. Figure [\ref=fig:compare-xis0] shows the ratio of XIS0 background subtracted spectrum extracted from the full circular region and from the annular region. The constant ratio indicates that both these spectra are similar and differ only in the observed count rates. Similar result is seen for XIS3 detector also. This confirms that the BS observation is not affected by pile-up.

The data processing version used for the HXD cleaned products is 2.1.6.15. Hence the PIN spectra are extracted using the cleaned event files following the standard analysis threads on the Suzaku website. The PIN non-X-ray background is extracted from the observation specific model provided by the instrument team. It is combined with the standard model for cosmic X-ray background. Appropriate response files for XIS nominal pointing available from the calibration database CALDB (version XIS-20101108, HXD-20101202) are used.

The XIS spectra are grouped such that the final spectra have ~  250 energy channels so that there are about three channels per energy resolution of ~  150eV. Energy channels corresponding to the energy range of 1.75-1.95 keV are ignored since the response files do not adequately remove the absorption edge present in this energy range. Ten consecutive energy channels are grouped into one energy channel of the final grouped PIN spectrum. The net count rates for the XIS and PIN spectra are given in Table [\ref=tab:table1]. We use XSPEC V12.5.1n to fit the spectral models to the observed X-ray spectrum.

Results

We have used two different phenomenological models to describe the observed spectra of the source in both the EIS and BS. In the first model (henceforth referred to as M1) we model the soft component using multi-temperature disk blackbody (DBB) and the hard component as Comptonised emission from the boundary layer. The hot boundary layer is assumed to completely cover the neutron star surface. This Eastern-like model has two variants. One, where the input photons to the boundary layer are from the accretion disk (M1a) and second where the input photons are from the underlying blackbody emission of the neutron star surface (M1b). The presence of a standard accretion disk allows for the possibility of a broad Iron line emission in this model which we include using the XSPEC model "diskline". In the second Western-like model (M2) we model the soft component using a single-temperature blackbody (BB) emitted from the boundary layer. The hard component is modelled as Comptonised emission from an inner hot disk where the input photons are from the boundary layer.

The Comptonised spectra for both the models is represented by the XSPEC function "nthcomp" [\citep=Zdz96] [\citep=Zyc99]. We apply this Comptonization model mainly because it can have input seed photon populations of different nature and distribution (pure blackbody, multicolour disk) thus allowing to test different emission geometries. In the M1a model the input photon distribution is due to disk blackbody and hence the input temperature is set equal to the maximum temperature of the disk blackbody emission. In the M2b model, input photon distribution is due to the blackbody emission from the NS surface and hence the input temperature is a free parameter. On the other hand in the M2 model, the photon distribution is due to neutron star boundary layer and hence of a blackbody shape and the input tempertature is set equal to the temperature of this neutron star boundary layer.

A multiplicative component ("wabs") is introduced in all spectral fitting to model the absorption of the source spectrum by intervening material along the line sight. We note here that the average Dickey & Lockman nH value in the direction of Aql X-1 is 0.33  ×  1022 cm- 2. The nH values obtained in our fits agree with this average value. Another constant multiplicative term is used in both the models for the relative normalisation of the XIS and corresponding HXD spectra. The cross-calibration constant for XIS nominal pointing as suggested by the Suzaku team is 1.16  ±  0.014 ,. The value for the constant that we get from our fits agree with those suggested by the Suzaku team within errors. The XSPEC model components used for M2 and M1 are tabulated in Table [\ref=tab:XSPEC_models]. While fitting the near simultaneous RXTE spectra, we fix the absorbing column density, nH to the corresponding nH value derived from the Suzaku spectral fit since RXTE data alone cannot constrain the nH value.

The normalisation parameter of the XSPEC BBody component gives the blackbody luminosity LBB and the normalisation parameter of the XSPEC BBodyrad component gives the blackbody radius RBB. Similarly from the parameter values of the XSPEC nthcomp component we can estimate the total Compton luminosity Lcomp, the required luminosity of the input photons Linp, the amplification factor (A) and when kTbb is a free parameter the radius of the blackbody RBB. From the XSPEC diskbb model we calculate the inner accretion disk radius (Rin) and the disk luminosity LDBB. The calculated values of these parameters allow us to constrain the two models considered here. Note that throughout this paper for calculating luminosities we use distance to the source as D  =  5.25  ±  1.25 Kpc (Rutledge et al. 2001) and the error quoted for luminosities take into account this uncertainty in the distance.

The results from the observations EI1, EI2 and EI3 when the source was in the EIS will be presented together in the next sub-section and that of the BS in the subsequent one.

Spectral analysis of Aql X-1 during the Extreme Island State

We start with analysing the Suzaku spectra using Model M1a. If the Iron line emission is omitted the best fit χ2  /  ν obtained are 284.50/241, 295.74/237 and 305.31/241 for observations EI1, EI2 and EI3 respectively. Adding a Gaussian line at 6.4 keV improves the fit considerably. The width of the Gaussian turns out to be >  0.5 keV, indicating the line is broad. Hence, we adopt the more physical "diskline" model to represent the Iron line. However, the data is not good enough to constrain all the parameters of the model and hence we fix some of them (emissivity index β  =   - 2.0, inclination angle [formula], inner radius Rin  =  10 and outer radius Rout  =  1000). Thus only the normalisation of the line is a fitted parameter. The same model is applied to near simultaneous RXTE observations. Removing the Iron line component for the RXTE spectra, gives best fit χ2  /  ν values of 38.39/29, 70.08/29, 64.21/24 for Obs. Id. 93405-01-04-01/05-01/06-00 respectively, which are significantly higher than χ2 obtained with the line feature. Thus, the Iron line feature is detected both in the Suzaku as well as in the RXTE spectra.

The electron temperature of the Comptonizing boundary layer component, kTin is unconstrained for observations EI1 and EI2 for both Suzaku and RXTE data with a lower limit of above 15keV. Hence we fix kTin  =  20 keV for these observations. The spectral parameters and the best fit χ2  /  ν obtained for the Suzaku and RXTE spectra are given in Table [\ref=tab:EIS-M1a]. Figure [\ref=fig:M1a-ufspec] shows the E2F(E) spectrum for Suzaku observation EI3 and corresponding RXTE spectrum along with the M1a model components. Note that the best fit spectral parameters are consistent within errors for the Suzaku and RXTE observations for all three sets. This similarity and consistency between the two different instruments, shows that the spectral extraction and response generation is robust and correct.

The inner radius of the accretion disk turns out to be ~  7 km which is rather small since it needs to be larger than the radius of the neutron star Rs  ~  10 km. However, this may be due to the uncertainty in the distance to the source. Assuming that the distance is 6.5 instead of 5.25 kpc used here would lead to physically acceptable inner radii of >  10 km. Moreover, the colour factor assumed here is f  =  1.7 and a slightly higher value could also correct this discrepancy. Note that the luminosity of the disk is of the same order as the input luminosity into the Comptonizing medium. This is an important consistency check since the model assumes that input photons arise from the accretion disk.

Next we consider the possibility that the input photons to the Comptonizing medium arise from a blackbody emission of the underlying neutron star surface (Model M1b). Thus in this model temperature of the blackbody emission, kTbb is an extra free parameter. The best fit χ2  /  ν values are 268.35/239, 266.18/235 and 260.83/239 for EI1, EI2 and EI3 observations respectively. The RXTE spectral fits are also consistent with the Suzaku fits, although the extra freedom of kTbb does not allow the spectral parameters to be well constrained. But it is noted that for EI1 and EI2, the values of kTbb and Tin coincide within errors whereas for EI3 kTbb  <  Tin which is not compatible with the geometry of this model. The calculated inner disk radii values for this model turn out to be larger at ~  9 km. However, the radius of the blackbody assumed to be from the neutron star surface, turns out to be rather small (~  5 km) for the first two observations, namely EI1 and EI2. Again, physical consistency may be obtained by using a larger distance to the source and/or including a colour factor in the blackbody radius calculation. Also for the EI3 observation, the obtained radius of the blackbody is RBB  =  18  ±  5 km which is greater than the calculated inner disk radius Rin  =  7.5  ±  0.3 km. Therefore, perhaps the more physical picture for EIS is that the input photons for Comptonization are mainly contributed by the accretion disk making M1a model more feasible than the M1b model in this case.

We consider next the alternate geometry where the Comptonised component arises from an inner hot disk and the boundary layer produces a blackbody emission (Model M2). When this model is used to fit the three EIS spectra the best fit χ2  /  ν for observations EI1, EI2 and EI3 are 300.87/241, 306.83/237 and 267.50/241 respectively. In this model the input photon temperature for Comptonization component kTbb is kept equal to the corresponding blackbody temperature kT. The calculated blackbody radius RBB for the three observations are 3.6  ±  0.9, 3.5  ±  0.8 and 4.1  ±  1.0 km respectively. These values are significantly smaller than the neutron star radius of ~  10 km. The values can be made consistent only by assuming a large distance to the source of >  11 kpc or by assuming an unphysical large colour factor of ~  3. Note that for a radius of 3 km the emitting region is only one-tenth the neutron star surface. This makes the geometry unfavourable as compared to the M1 model.

Moreover, the χ2 values obtained are significantly larger than the ones obtained for M1 models. Even if we include a broad Iron line (which in the absence of a cold disk may not be physical) the χ2  /  ν values are 293.99/239, 285.49/235 and 260.46/239 which are higher than the ones obtained for the M1 model. Consistent results are obtained from the RXTE data which provide χ2  /  ν of 34.40/28, 87.43/29 and 24.33/23 respectively, again significantly higher than what was obtained earlier.

Spectral analysis of Aql X-1 during the Banana State

We now come to the spectral analysis of the first Suzaku observation taken during the decline of the 2007 Aql X-1 outburst. During this observation the overall X-ray source flux is higher than that during the next three observations when the source is in the EIS. It was seen that for this BS Suzaku spectrum there is an excess of count rate at the high energy end of the spectrum which could not be modelled by thermal Comptonization. We have added a hard power-law component (with photon index Γ  =  0) to all spectral fitting to account for the high energy excess. We note here that energy contribution of this component diverges with energy and hence there should be a cutoff at both the high and low energy end. But for the given data neither the photon index nor the cutoffs at low and high energies could be constrained. Therefore luminosity contributed by this component has been calculated only in the energy range of 0.7-70.0 keV in which the spectral fitting has been performed.

Table [\ref=tab:obsid10-M1] lists the best fit parameters for the variations of the cold accretion disk model (M1a/b) while Figure [\ref=fig:HF-ufspec] shows the unfolded spectrum with the different components for the M1a model. The electron temperature of the Comptonizing region is smaller (kTe  ~  2.3 keV) as expected and the inner radius of the accretion disk is significantly larger at ~  40 km. As in the EIS fitting, the disk luminosity is nearly equal to the input luminosity (as expected in this geometry), although the luminosities have increased by nearly an order of magnitude. Here, in M1b model, the radius of the underlying neutron star, RBB  ~  10 km, which is larger (and hence more physical) than that obtained for the EIS state. Note that the high energy power-law component contributes around 1.5% of the total luminosity. Without this component the χ2  /  ν is 282.81/234 for M1a model and 279.90/233 for M2b model. For both M1a and M1b model, the emissivity index of the "diskline" model can be constrained to q  ~   - 3.

The alternate geometry of an hot inner disk (M2) provides an unacceptably larger χ2  /  ν of 359.99/235. The inclusion of a broad Gaussian for the Iron line (which may not be physical given the absence of a cold disk) reduces it to 338.43/233, which is still significantly higher than what is obtained for the M1 models. However, in this case the radius of the blackbody emitting boundary layer turns out to be ~  18 km and hence is physically possible.

Summary and Discussion

In this work, we analyse Suzaku and RXTE observations of Aql X-1, to constrain the geometry of the source in both the low flux EIS and high flux BS, and to report the discovery of a hard X-ray tail in the BS. In particular, a standard accretion disk with a hot Comptonizing boundary layer whose input photons are from the disk is the preferred geometry for both states. The alternate model of a hot Comptonizing inner disk and a blackbody emitting boundary layer gives significantly larger χ2 for all four Suzaku observations including three nearly simultaneous RXTE observations. Moreover, for the EIS observations, the radius of the blackbody emitting boundary layer turns out to be unphysically small, ~  3 km. The presence of a broad Iron line feature provides further support for the existence of a cold accretion disk in the source. The preferred geometry is the same as inferred from broad band study of many other NS-LMXBs [\citep=Bar01] and hence seems to be general.

For all observations, the luminosity of the input photons to the Comptonizing hot boundary layer is similar to that of the disk and hence it is possible that the main source of input photons is the disk itself. While it may also be possible that the source of soft photons could be the underlying blackbody emitting neutron star, statistically the data cannot differentiate between these scenarios.

Our results confirm that the electron temperature of the Comptonizing boundary layer in EIS is higher as compared to same in the BS. Also the inner radius of the accretion disk is higher during the BS observation. The spectral slope γ  ~  1.8 remains nearly constant, implying that the optical depth has increased in the high flux state. In the "nthcomp" model, the optical depth of the medium, for a spherical geometry can be estimated by [\citep=Sun80]

[formula]

The optical depth τ  ~  2 for the observations EI1 and EI2 and ~  5 for the EI3 observation. In the BS τ  ~  13. The difference in the electron temperature is the primary cause for the two states to have different locations in the colour-colour diagrams. A larger number of observations, sampling the source at different times of the outburst will provide more information regarding the complete temporal evolution of the source.

For the EISs, when the input photons are assumed to be from the disk (Table [\ref=tab:EIS-M1a]), the luminosity of the disk is ~  5  ×  1035 ergs s- 1. The luminosity of the boundary layer, which is the luminosity in the Comptonised component minus the input luminosity Lcomp - Linp, is ~  2.5  ×  1036 ergs s- 1. Thus energy released in the boundary layer is about 5 times larger than that of the disk. When the input photons are taken to be the underlying neutron star surface, boundary layer luminosity, Lcomp  ~  2.8  ×  1036 ergs s- 1 is about a factor of four more than the disk luminosity ~  7  ×  1035 ergs s- 1. For the BS this ratio is ~  1 when the input photons are disk photons and ~  0.7 when they arise from the underlying star surface. Theoretically, the ratio of the energy output in the boundary layer to that of the disk can range from 1-3 depending on the spin and equation of state of the neutron star [\citep=Bha00]. A ratio of five would imply an extremely soft equation of state. However, the simple phenomenological models used here do not warrant one to make concrete statements but one can conclude that the boundary layer is more luminous than the disk, which is consistent with the expected energy release ratio.

An interesting result is the detection of an hard X-ray power-law emission in the high flux state which is only 1.5% of the total source luminsoity. Such hard tails have been detected in Z sources and only one Atoll source GX 13+1 earlier [\citep=Pai06]. The origin of this emission is unknown and maybe due to some non-thermal emission in a jet [\citep=Mig06]. Indeed, a weak radio emission has been detected in the high soft state of Aql X-1 [\citep=Rup04], which is also observed in other atoll sources [\citep=Mig06]. Alternatively, the hard X-ray emission could be due to an hybrid non-thermal emission [\citep=Cop99] or bulk motion Comptonization [\citep=Tit97]. Multiple observations of the source may reveal whether the hard X-ray tail is variable and whether it is correlated with the radio emission.

The work highlights the utility of broad band spectral analysis of LMXB. Apart from other Suzaku observations the upcoming Indian satellite ASTROSAT will be useful in such studies of LMXBs containing weakly magnetised neutron stars as it will provide good timing and spectral resolution.
