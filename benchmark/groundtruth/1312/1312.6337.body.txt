A note on the degree-diameter problem for arc-transitive graphs

Department of Mathematics and Statistics The University of Melbourne Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia

0.5

All graphs in this note are finite and undirected with no loops or multiple edges. An arc of a graph is an ordered pair of adjacent vertices. A graph is vertex-transitive if its automorphism group is transitive on its vertex set, that is, any vertex can be permuted to any other vertex by an automorphism. A graph is arc-transitive if it is vertex-transitive and in addition its automorphism group is transitive on the set of arcs.

Given integers Δ,D  ≥  1, let N(Δ,D) denote the maximum order (number of vertices) in a graph of maximum degree Δ and diameter at most D. The well known degree-diameter problem asks for finding N(Δ,D) together with the corresponding extremal graphs. A huge amount of work on this problem and its restrictions to several graph classes, including the classes of bipartite graphs, vertex-transitive graphs and Cayley graphs, has been done [\cite=MS] since over fifty years ago [\cite=HS]. In contrast, very little is known on this problem when restricted to the class of arc-transitive graphs [\cite=wiki]. Denote by Nat(Δ,D) (Nvt(Δ,D), respectively) the maximum order of an arc-transitive graph (vertex-transitive graph, respectively) of degree Δ and diameter at most D. In this note we give two lower bounds on Nat(Δ,2).

In the case when D = 2, the well known Moore bound [\cite=MS] gives

[formula]

for any Δ. Here the equality holds only when Δ  =  1,2,3,7 and possibly 57, and for all other Δ we have N(Δ,2)  ≤  Δ2  -  1 [\cite=MS]. Regarding lower bounds, it is known [\cite=Brown] that N(Δ,2)  ≥  Δ2  -  Δ  +  1 for every Δ such that Δ  -  1 is a prime. In [\cite=MMS] it was proved that, for Δ  =  (3q - 1) / 2 with q a prime power congruent to 1 modulo 4, we have

[formula]

This bound came with the discovery [\cite=MMS] of an infinite family of vertex-transitive graphs (now well known as the McKay-Miller-irá graphs) with degree Δ  =  (3q - 1) / 2 and order 8(Δ  +  (1 / 2))2 / 9. Such extremal graphs are not arc-transitive except the Hoffman-Singleton graph. This is because, apart from this exceptional case, all McKay-Miller-irá graphs admit a nontrivial partition [\cite=Hafner] with cross-block edges which is invariant under the automorphism group, but on the other hand there are edges [\cite=Hafner] with end-vertices in the same block of the partition. Thus the lower bound in ([\ref=eq:mms]) may not apply to Nat(Δ,2). In [\cite=ANS], it was proved that for Δ  =  2q - 1 with q a prime power not congruent to 1 modulo 4, Nvt(Δ,2)  ≥  (Δ  +  1)2 / 2.

Recently, a significant improvement over ([\ref=eq:mms]) was made in [\cite=SS], where iagiová and irá proved the existence of a Cayley graph of degree Δ  =  22m + δ + (2 + δ)2m + 1  -  6, diameter 2, and order greater than [formula], where m is any positive integer and δ  =  0 or 1. This implies, for Δ of this form,

[formula]

Again this bound may not apply to Nat(Δ,2) since the extremal graphs [\cite=SS] are not arc-transitive.

In view of ([\ref=eq:Moore])-([\ref=eq:ss]), it is natural to ask [\cite=Zhou-JGT] whether a lower bound on Nat(Δ,2) of order O(Δ2) exists for infinitely many Δ or even any Δ. We record the following observations, the first of which answers this question in the affirmative.

For any even integer Δ  ≥  2,

[formula]

For any 0  <  ε  <  1, there exist infinitely many odd integers Δ of the form q3(qd - 2  -  1) / (q - 1), where q is an odd prime power and d  ≥  3 / ε is an odd integer, such that

[formula]

We remark that the arc-transitive graphs proving these results are not new. Nevertheless, it seems that these bounds have not been noted before; they are among the first general lower bounds for Nat(Δ,2) as far as we know. It is our hope that these observations may inspire further studies on the degree-diameter problem for arc-transitive graphs.

The graphs proving ([\ref=eq:hamming]) are the well known Hamming graph H(2,q) (where q  ≥  2 is an integer), namely the graph with vertex set [formula] such that two pairs are adjacent if and only if they differ in exactly one coordinate.

The lower bound ([\ref=eq:p1]) is obtained by using a result in [\cite=Zhou-EJC]. Let d  ≥  3 be an integer and q a prime power. Two distinct lines L,N of the projective space PG(d - 1,q) are called intersecting if there exists a unique point incident with both L and N (that is, L and N lie on the same plane of PG(d - 1,q)). Define the projective flag graph Γ(d,q) to be the graph whose vertices are the (point, line)-flags of PG(d - 1,q) such that two such flags (σ,L),(τ,N) are adjacent if and only if L,N are intersecting lines of PG(d - 1,q). This graph was introduced in [\cite=Zhou-EJC] (and was denoted by Γ+(P;d,q) there) in the classification of a family of arc-transitive graphs.

(a) Since H(2,q) is arc-transitive (see e.g. [\cite=P]) with diameter 2, degree Δ = 2(q - 1) and order q2  =  (Δ / 2  +  1)2, we obtain ([\ref=eq:hamming]) immediately. Note that Δ  ≥  2 can be any even integer since q  ≥  2 can be any integer.

(b) Let d  ≥  3 be an integer and q a prime power. It is well known that any group G with PSL(d,q)  ≤  G  ≤  PΓL(d,q) acts doubly transitively on the point-set of PG(d - 1,q) (see e.g. [\cite=Beth-Jung-Lenz]). In [\cite=Zhou-EJC] it was proved that the projective flag graph Γ(d,q) is G-arc transitive with diameter 2, girth 3 and degree Δ  =  q3(qd - 2  -  1) / (q - 1). Since PG(d - 1,q) has (qd  -  1) / (q - 1) points and each of them is in (qd - 1  -  1) / (q - 1) lines (see e.g. [\cite=Beth-Jung-Lenz]), the order of Γ(d,q) is equal to N  =  (qd  -  1)(qd - 1  -  1) / (q - 1)2.

Note that [formula]. Since Δ  =  q3(qd - 2  -  1) / (q - 1), we have q  ≤  Δ1 / d and the equality holds if and only if d = 3. Thus, for this Δ, we have

[formula]

and the equality holds if and only if d = 3 and q = 2. Therefore, for any 0  <  ε  <  1, any prime power q, and any d  ≥  3 / ε, we have

[formula]

In particular, if both d and q are odd, then Δ is odd and therefore (b) is proved. [formula]

Note that Δ is even when d or q is even. Although ([\ref=eq:p1]) is still valid in this case, in general it is inferior to ([\ref=eq:hamming]) in this case.

In view of the discussion above we pose the following question.

Are there infinitely many integers Δ  ≥  2 such that

[formula]

for some function f with f(x) / x2  →  0 as x  →    ∞  ?
