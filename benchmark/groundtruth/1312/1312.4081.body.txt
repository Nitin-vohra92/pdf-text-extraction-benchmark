Stäckel Hamiltonians

The Stäckel systems [\cite=stack] were considered in many works, see e.g. [\cite=eiz], [\cite=blaz] and references therein, [\cite=blaz2]. Associated with this approach questions about the related problems on the separation of variables were considered for example in the works [\cite=skl],[\cite=kaln]. The popularity of these systems can be explained by the fact that a number of important finite-dimensional integrable systems can be brought to the Stäckel form by a change of variables. The goal of this article is the study of quasi-Stäckel systems which can be described as integrable deformations of Stäckel systems with the same principal parts.

First, we recall the general construction of the classical Stäckel system with n degrees of freedom. The corresponding Hamiltonians are defined by the system of linear algebraic equations.

[formula]

The matrix Ski is called the Stäckel matrix. Let us consider the simplest inverse Stäckel matrix [formula] (this is the so-called Benenti case [\cite=benenti],[\cite=benenti2]) and the function ψ(pk,qk) = s(qk)p2k + u(qk). This approach is usual to obtain representation of the Stäckel system in terms of separated variables. Solving of the system ([\ref=stack]) yields a family of Hamiltonians which is commutative with respect to the canonical Darboux-Poisson bracket {qi,pj}  =  δij:

[formula]

The coefficients of the generating function [formula] provide a set of n Hamiltonians in involution. Therefore the Stäckel system described by these Hamiltonians is integrable in the Liouville sense.

Quasi-Stäckel Hamiltonians in n = 3 case

The quasi-Stäckel systems in the two-dimensional case were introduced in [\cite=umn]. The analogous systems were considered in [\cite=Gram], [\cite=ferap], [\cite=Ye], see also references therein. We recall that the Hamiltonians of quasi-Stäckel systems are Hamiltonians of Stackel systems plus magnetic (linear in momenta) terms.

The Hamiltonians hi of quasi-Stäckel systems in the Benenti case are defined for arbitrary n as follows:

[formula]

One can obtain a generating function h(α) analogously to the Stäckel case

[formula]

In order to characterize the integrable cases, we find the Hamiltonians hi as the coefficients of the generating function [formula] ([\ref=ha]), compute the commutators and equate them to zero:

[formula]

Unlike the Stäckel case these commutators do not vanish identically and in order to obtain a full classification one has to determine the functions S,zi,j,ui from this set of [formula] equations which are quadratic in the momenta. This is a difficult problem for n > 3 and we consider only the case n = 3 in this article.

The first step is to solve the equations corresponding to vanishing of the quadratic in the momenta terms. This can be done by straightforward, although tedious computation and we arrive to the following statement.

Notice that, strictly speaking, the diagonal coefficients may be of the form [formula], but one can set zii = 0 by use of the canonical transformation [formula].

The analysis of the rest equations brings to the following two (non-Stäckel) cases.

1. Symmetric case: Δi,i = 0,  Δi  ≠  j =  - δ,  S(x) = a(x)2 where a(x) is a quadratic polynomial.

2. Non-symmetric case: Δ2,3  =  Δ3,2 =  - δ and all other Δi,j = 0 (up to change of numeration) and S is a polynomial of sixth degree.

These cases describe all possible three-dimensional quasi-Stäckel systems.

We recall that the dynamics of the quasi-Stäckel system is defined by Hamiltonians hi. Now we consider these two cases in detail.

Symmetric case

In the general symmetric case the final answer is given by the following statement.

Remark.

1) In fact, u(x,y,z) is defined up to a quadratic polynomial b(x) = b0x2 + b1x + b2, but one can exclude it by the shifts hi  →  hi - bi.

2) In the case a3 = 0, that is if a(x) is a quadratic polynomial, the canonical transformation

[formula]

allows to exclude the potential u completely. In this case, the family ([\ref=ha2]) takes the form

[formula]

Using relation [formula] we obtain Hamiltonians h0,h1,h2 in involution: {h0,h1} = 0,{h1,h2} = 0,{h2,h0} = 0, therefore the system ([\ref=symm_g]) is a Liouville integrable. Let us discuss some applications of this system to the problems of hydrodynamic type. To this end, we introduce three times t,τ,ξ which describe the full evolution of the system:

[formula]

and denote I1 = q1 + q2 + q3,  I2 = q1q2 + q2q3 + q3q1,  I3 = q1q2q3.

One can easily prove by computing [formula] that any solution of ([\ref=times]) satisfies the hydrodynamic type system

[formula]

Quite similarly, the computation of [formula] brings to another hydrodynamic type system

[formula]

A system ([\ref=GTa]) is a generalization of the celebrated Gibbons-Tsarev system [\cite=GT]. Some systems analogous to ([\ref=GTa],[\ref=GTb]) were considered in [\cite=ferap] and recently in [\cite=sok]. Both systems can be generalized to the case of any dimension.

We do not know at the moment the separation of variables for system ([\ref=symm_g]) and whether it is solvable.

But we will show that in the special symmetric case a(x) = 1 the system is solvable. In the rest of the section, we consider this case in detail and obtain its general solution. To this end, we write the system ([\ref=q-stack]) with a(x) = 1 in a 'separated' form (in δ = 0 case this system is separated indeed and coincides with the Stäckel one) as follows

[formula]

We solve system ([\ref=symm]) linear with respect to hk, denote hk = Hk + Vkδ,  k = 0,1,2 and obtain

[formula]

[formula]

We introduce two more functions

[formula]

to obtain a Poisson algebra with 7 generators H0,H1,H2,V1,V2,V3,V4:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The main reason that the system is solvable is not only Liouville integrability but the fact that [formula] This allows to introduce the notation Vi = vi(τ,ξ), and to find the momenta p1,p2,p3 from the linear system V1 = v1(τ,ξ),  V2 = v2(τ,ξ),  V4 = v4(τ,ξ). The variables qi are found then by use of only first Hamiltonian equation

[formula]

after substituting the obtained momenta. In order to determine qi it is convenient to consider the dynamical systems

[formula]

First, we find the t-dynamics of Ik:

[formula]

[formula]

Then step by step we restore the τ- and ξ-dependence using the additional identities:

[formula]

where h̃i are constant values of Hamiltonians hi.

Finally, we obtain the general solution of the quasi-Stäckel system under consideration as the zeroes of the cubic equation

[formula]

with the coefficients

[formula]

[formula]

where notations are used

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

This solution depends on the full set of integration constants t0,C1,C2,C3,C4,λ.

Non-symmetric case

In this case we obtain one-dimensional Stäckel system (recall that we can assume that Hi are constant)

[formula]

The action in this case is of the form [formula].

The remaining two-dimensional (quasi-Stäckel) system reads

[formula]

[formula]

where S is a polynomial of sixth degree [\cite=MarSok1].

Notice that Hamiltonians Hi defined by these systems are three-dimensional, that is, they depend on all variables qi,pi, [formula] At the moment, only the partial separation of variables is known for this system [\cite=MarSok2].

In this article we considered a classification of three-dimensional quasi-Stäckel systems. We obtain only two families: - symmetric three-dimensional system and non-symmetric ones. In the case a(x) = 1 the symmetric system is solvable and we obtain the general solution of this system. The calculations become very involved for the case n > 3 and at the moment one can hardly expect to obtain a full classification even in the n = 4 case. On the other hand, system ([\ref=symm]) admits a straightforward generalization for the case n > 3. Preliminary result is that in n = 4 case we obtain {hi,hj} = 0,  i,j = 0,1,2,3 except for the relation {h2,h3}  ≠  0. This is a surprising fact and we have no Liouville integrability in this case.
