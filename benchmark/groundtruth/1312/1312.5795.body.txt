Affine stratification of A4.

Introduction

It is well known that the coarse moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties (ppav) Ag is not a projective variety over [formula]. Natural compactifications of Ag such as the Satake-Baily-Borel compactification ASatg [\cite=satake] and various toroidal compactifications have been constructed, see for example [\cite=namikawabook],[\cite=fachbook]. The quasi projectivity of Ag raises interesting questions, regarding its cohomological dimension and related invariants such as the affine covering number and affine stratification number. We address some questions regarding these invariants.

We now introduce some definitions [\cite=rova] to make the comments above precise.

Similarly

The relationship between affine covering number, affine stratification number and cohomological dimension is given by the following theorem.

[\cite=rova] The coherent cohomological dimension of a scheme X is bounded above by the affine stratification number of the scheme X which in turn is bounded above by the affine covering number of X, i.e., [formula]. Similarly the constructible cohomological dimension is bounded above by [formula], i.e. [formula].

Our main result is the following statement, over [formula].

There exists an affine stratification of [formula] of length 6.

Using theorem [\ref=asnqcoh], we get the following corollary:

The cohomological dimension [formula], while the constructible cohomological dimension [formula].

As an application of the study of the tautological ring of Ag, we also prove the following proposition.

The affine covering number of Ag for all g is bounded below by g(g - 1) / 2, i.e., [formula].

Let [formula] denote the moduli space of ppav over a finite field of characteristic p. Oort [\cite=oortconj] showed that [formula] has a complete subvariety Yp of codimension g -- the locus of ppav the scheme of whose p-torsion points is supported at the origin (completeness follows from the fact that [formula] always has non-trivial p-torsion, so that no semiabelic variety can lie in the closure). Since Yp is complete, we have [formula], and thus since Yp is a closed subvariety of [formula], it follows that [formula]. In particular we have [formula].

Oort [\cite=oortconj] had conjectured that [formula] does not have a complete subvariety of codimension g, this conjecture was proven by Keel and Sadun in [\cite=kesa].

Based on Remark [\ref=remark] and Theorem [\ref=affine_covering_number] we make the following conjecture.

The cohomological dimension of Ag in all characteristics is equal to g(g - 1) / 2, i.e. [formula].

Fontanari and Pascolutti [\cite=Fontanari:2011aa] constructed an affine open cover of the moduli space M4 of curves of genus 4. They did this by carefully constructing three modular forms whose zero loci have an empty intersection in M4. Two of the modular forms are combinatorially constructed so as to ensure the vanishing of two theta constants and a third modular form is constructed to avoid the hyperelliptic locus, which is defined in M4 by the condition that two theta constants vanish. We will use a similar approach to construct an affine stratification of A4, but after some point, our strategy for the construction will diverge from Fontanari and Pascolutti's approach. Unfortunately the strategy used by Fontanari and Pascolutti will not work for our purposes because of the inherent combinatorial difficulties in understanding vanishing loci of theta constants with characteristics.

Notation and Preliminaries

We will exclusively work over [formula] and we denote by Hg the Siegel upper half space of g  ×  g complex symmetric matrices with positive definite imaginary part. There is an action of [formula] on Hg given by

[formula]

Here elements of [formula] are written in block form and they consist of the integer matrices that preserve the skew symmetric non-degenerate bilinear form given by [formula].

We recall that Ag has the structure of a quasi-projective variety (see [\cite=igusabook], [\cite=grAgsurvey]) and can also be described as a group quotient [formula]. A scalar modular form of weight k with respect to a subgroup [formula] is a holomorphic function [formula] such that

[formula]

for any [formula].

We denote by θm(z,τ) the theta function with characteristic [formula] given by

[formula]

Here [formula] and [formula]. We shall say m is an even characteristic if [formula].. We will denote E to be the set of all even characteristics.

It can easily be checked that θm(z,τ) is an even function of z if and only if m is an even characteristic. We shall call θm(0,τ) the theta constant with characteristic m. It follows from the above discussion that θm(0,τ) vanishes identically if m is not an even characteristic. We shall denote E to be the set of all even theta characteristics in [formula]. From now on, whenever we refer to theta constants, it is implicitly understood that we refer to theta constants with even characteristics.

It is known that theta constants are modular forms of weight 1 / 2 with respect to a certain subgroup [formula][\cite=igusabook]. For our purposes we will also need the fact that θm(0,τ)8 is a modular form of weight 4 with respect to [formula]. Here Γ(2) is the level 2 congruence subgroup of [formula] given by

[formula]

The level two cover of Ag is defined as

[formula]

The Galois group of the cover p:Ag(2)  →  Ag is equal to [formula], and the above discussion means that eighth powers of theta constants are sections of an appropriate line bundle on Ag(2).

Under the action of the entire modular group [formula] theta constants transform as follows. We define the affine action of [formula] on theta characteristics by the formula [\cite=igusabook]

[formula]

for [formula], then in this notation, we have

[formula]

Thus a polynomial in theta constants defines a modular form for the entire [formula] if it is invariant under the affine action on characteristics

We shall denote the vector space of scalar modular forms of weight k with respect to [formula] by Mk. There is a natural compactification of Ag called the Satake compactification defined by

[formula]

Thus using the definition, one sees that zero loci of scalar modular forms with respect to [formula] are ample divisors in ASatg. The modular forms that we will consider are all cusp forms i.e.  they all vanish identically on the boundary [formula]. Thus in particular if D  ⊂  ASatg is a closed subscheme and if F is a cusp form such that the zero locus Z(F) does not contain any irreducible components of D then [formula] is an ample divisor in D and [formula] is affine.

We will denote Adecg to be the Zariski closed subset of Ag consisting of decomposable ppav, i.e.  ppav that are isomorphic to a product of lower-dimensional ppav. We will denote [formula] the Zariski open subset of Ag consisting of ppav that are not isomorphic to a product of lower dimensional ppav. We will denote Hypg the locally closed subvariety of Ag consisting of the hyperelliptic jacobians.

It is worthwhile to recall that Hypg is affine. This is seen to be the case as hyperelliptic curves of genus g are double covers of [formula] branched along 2g + 2 distinct points on [formula]. Thus a hyperelliptic curve is determined by a choice of 2g + 2 points on [formula] up to an action of [formula]. Thus Hypg can be naturally identified with a finite group quotient of M0,2g + 2, here M0,2g + 2 denotes the moduli space of ordered 2g + 2 points on [formula]. The space M0,2g + 2 is known to be affine, see for example [\cite=hamobook].

From now on we will abuse notation and denote Ak  ×  Ag - k the closed subset of Ag consisting of ppav that are isomorphic to a product of a k-dimensional ppav and a (g - k)-dimensional ppav. Strictly speaking this is an abuse of notation as we could have used Ag - k  ×  Ak to denote this closed subset as well. Thus for example when we write A2  ×  A2  ⊂  A4 we really mean [formula].

We will now state a result of Igusa and Salvati Manni on the orbits of tuples of theta characteristics under the action of [formula] given by [\eqref=trans], which we will use in our construction of modular forms.

Given two p-tuples of even theta characteristics I  =  (m1,m2,...mp) and J  =  (n1,n2....np), they are in the same orbit of the action of the deck group [formula] on the set of p-tuples of theta characteristics, if and only if the following conditions hold:

1. Linear relations among even number of terms in I translate to corresponding linear relations in J, i.e., mi1  +  mi2....  +  mi2l  =  0 if and only if ni1  +  ni2  +  ni3....ni2l  =  0.

2. e(mi + mj + mk)  =  e(ni + nj + nk) [formula].

For a given k, let nk be the number of theta characteristics in E of the form [formula] with [formula] and [formula], i.e. [formula].

Let I∈Enk be a nk tuple all of whose characteristics are of the form described above. Then we have the following theorem.

Given τ∈Hg then

[formula]

Consider the universal family π:Xg  →  Ag. The Hodge bundle [formula] is the locally free sheaf on Ag defined by the sheaf of relative differentials, E: = π*(Ω1Xg  /  Ag) and let λi be the i'th Chern class of this sheaf. It has been shown by van der Geer [\cite=vdgeercycles] and Esnault and Viehweg [\cite=esvi] that [formula]. It is also known that [formula] is one dimensional for g  ≥  2, [\cite=borel]. This implies that there does not exist a collection of g(g - 1) / 2 divisors in Ag with an empty intersection. We claim that this implies that [formula], because of the following lemma.

For g  ≥  2,

We have thus proven

The affine covering number [formula].

Proof of main theorem

The proof of Theorem 2 is divided into two steps. The first step consists of writing down three modular forms whose zero loci in A4 intersect in a Zariski closed subset of A4 of codimension 3, thus giving us three affine strata. This construction is similar to that of Fontanari and Pascolutti [\cite=Fontanari:2011aa]. The second step consists of constructing the remaining 4 strata by identifying natural codimension one subvarieties of closures of successive strata.

Step 1(Strata induced by zero loci of modular forms):

1st Stratum: Consider the Schottky form defined by the following formula, using the notation in [\cite=Fontanari:2011aa]

[formula]

Igusa [\cite=igusachristoffel] showed that the zero locus Z(FT) of FT is equal to J4  ⊂  A4. We define our first stratum to be

[formula]

2nd Stratum: Consider the Theta null form on A4

[formula]

From Riemann's theta singularity theorem it easily follows that the modular form Θnull does not vanish identically on Mg in any genus. We thus define our second stratum to be

[formula]

This stratum corresponds to Jacobians of canonical curves of genus four that are given by a complete intersection of a smooth cubic and a smooth quadric. [\cite=dolgachevbook]

The group action of [formula] on theta characteristics becomes important from the third stratum onwards. The reason for its importance is the following: if V1  =  Z(θ8m1,θ8m2)  ⊂  Ag(2) and if V2  =  Z(θ8n1,θ8n2), then ([\ref=automorphy]) and Theorem [\ref=tuplesorbits] tell us that V1 and V2 are equivalent to each other under the action of the Galois group of the cover Ag(2)  →  Ag.

In general, from the transformation formula for theta constant [\eqref=automorphy] of theta constants, it follows that if mi's and ni's satisfy the conditions of Theorem [\ref=tuplesorbits], then the Galois group of this level 2 cover conjugates Z(θ8m1,θ8m2,....θ8mk)  ⊂  Ag(2) to Z(θ8n1,θ8n2....θ8nk)  ⊂  Ag(2) . We should mention that R. Varley constructed an example of a set of 10 theta constants vanishing on a level cover of A4 that describes a single ppav, which corresponds to the Segre cubic threefold with an even point of order two; i.e., a cubic threefold with 10 nodes [\cite=varley]. The correspondence between cubic threefolds and A4 arises due to the work of Donagi and Smith [\cite=dosm], further explored by Izadi [\cite=izadiA4], which establishes a birational map between A4 and a level cover of the moduli of cubic three folds C. This is in contrast to the situation where a different set of 10 theta constants i.e. one lying in a different orbit of the [formula] action in ([\ref=trans]) describes the hyperlliptic locus.

3rd Stratum: Consider the modular form F1 given by

[formula]

The Zariski closed subset given by [formula] can be interpreted as the closed subset of J4 where some two theta constants vanish. Igusa [\cite=igusagen4] proved that a curve ∈M4  ⊂  A4 is hyperelliptic if and only if two theta constants vanish on the Jacobian of C. On the other hand Theorem 7 and Remark 8 tell us that [formula]. Hence we see [formula]. We thus define our third stratum to be

[formula]

This stratum corresponds to Jacobians of canonical curves of genus four that are a complete intersection of a smooth cubic and a singular quadric of rank three. [\cite=dolgachevbook]

The two modular forms given by F1 and Θnull were used by Fontanari and Pascolutti in proving Looijenga's conjecture for M4 [\cite=Fontanari:2011aa]. They then use another modular form FH again constructed as a sum of products of theta constants. They then go on to show that this modular form does not intersect Hyp4  ⊂  M4. We will not be able to use FH to construct our 4th stratum as Z(FT,F1,Θnull,FH)  =  Adec4, since the codimension of Adec4  ⊂  A4 equals to 3, we see that the stratification using FH is not optimal as we will be using four forms to describe a geometric locus of codimension 3.

Step 2 (Affine stratification constructed by identifying appropriate closed subvarieties)

4th Stratum: Consider the boundary of the previous stratum, which is [formula]. We know that Hypg is affine for all g. The boundary of [formula] is equal to [formula]. It is known classically that in A3, jacobians of hyperelliptic curves are characterized by the vanishing of a single theta constant, that is to say [formula]. Since moreover A1 is affine, the product [formula] is affine, as a product of affine varieties. We thus define our fourth stratum to be

[formula]

Since X3 is a disjoint union of two affine varieties, it is itself affine.

5th Stratum: Consider the boundary of the previous stratum

[formula]

Now recall that that any indecomposable abelian threefold is a Jacobian of a smooth curve; it thus follows that [formula], while A2  ×  A2  =  Mct2  ×  Mct2. Thus by remark 5 we see that

[formula]

We know M2 to be affine as M2  =  Hyp2. On the other hand, we have

[formula]

We thus define our fifth stratum to be

[formula]

This stratum is seen to be affine as A1  =  Hyp1 is affine, as are Hyp3 and M2.

6th Stratum: Consider the boundary of the previous stratum [formula]. Since A1 is known to be affine we just need to stratify A2. But A2  =  Mct2, and [formula]. Thus we define our sixth stratum to be

[formula]

This stratum is affine as it simply equal to A1  ×  A1  ×  M2.

7th Stratum: We finally define our seventh stratum to be

[formula]

We then see that A1 is affine as A1  =  Hyp1, and the theorem is thus proven.

The next question that is natural to consider is if there exists an affine stratification of A5. There are a few difficulties in approaching this problem. For one, the geometry of M5 in A5 is not easily accessible through the machinery of modular forms as [formula] and it is not known if the Schottky locus is a set theoretic complete intersection in A5.
