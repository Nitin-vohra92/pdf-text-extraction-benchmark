Giant thermovoltage in single InAs-nanowire field-effect transistors

The quest for large-scale solid-state thermoelectric (TE) conversion was one of the major driving forces behind semiconductor research before the discovery of the transistor effect [\cite=Majumdar04]. Expectations were not met, however, largely because of efficiency issues and the high costs and material toxicity. Indeed achievement of efficient TE devices requires a non-trivial tuning of interdependent material parameters and can be expressed in terms of the maximization of the figure of merit ZT = σS2T / κ, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, σ and κ are the electrical and thermal conductivities, T the average operation temperature [\cite=Majumdar04] [\cite=BookTE]. Large ZT values proved elusive over the past decades despite the great design flexibility offered by semiconductor heterostuctured materials [\cite=Snyder08]. Nanotechnology has recently revived the interest on this research area and may be able to play the role of a game-changer. It enables the design of artificial materials with novel properties and thus opens alternative routes to the optimization of thermodynamic efficiency [\cite=Dresselhaus07] [\cite=Vineis10] [\cite=Shi12] [\cite=Venkatasubramanian01] [\cite=Boukai08] [\cite=Poudel08] [\cite=Heremans08]. Among these, nanowire-based structures have attracted a significant interest [\cite=Shi10] [\cite=Martinez11] [\cite=Lee11] [\cite=Zhou11] [\cite=Tian12] [\cite=Moon13].

In this Letter, we focus on the TE properties of single InAs nanowires (NWs), self-assembled nanostructures actively investigated in view of a number of potential applications in novel electronics [\cite=RoddaroNR11] [\cite=Spathis11] [\cite=Giazotto11] and optoelectronics [\cite=Vitiello12] [\cite=Pitanti11]. The present InAs NW model system is also particularly relevant for the investigation of strongly-confined low-dimensional systems [\cite=ThelanderAPL2003] [\cite=Bjork04] [\cite=Fuhrer07] [\cite=Roddaro11] [\cite=Romeo12], which in turn may make available exciting heat-transport and TE properties [\cite=Hoffmann09] [\cite=Zhang11]. Here we demonstrate that record-high thermovoltage values in excess of 1  mV can be induced in devices comprising a single-NW as active element and that these values can be modulated by field-effect. A buried-heater approach allows us to combine a large thermal gradient with the field-effect control of single nanostructures deposited on standard oxidized silicon. We highlight that this scheme can be of general interest for the investigation of a large class of nanomaterials with potential TE applications. We shall provide a precise map of the Seebeck coefficient in our NWs as a function of σ from room temperature down to [formula]. Also, since S vs. σ curves are strongly dependent on electron scattering times, our experimental data lead to an estimate of the electron mobility μe,S, which we shall compare with the values obtained with the standard approach based on field-effect mobility μe,F E. The role of surface states and gate hysteresis [\cite=Halpern12] in NW transport properties and in our parameter estimates will be discussed.

One of the single-NW field-effect transistors (FETs) studied is depicted in Fig. 1. Devices were built starting from [formula]-diameter InAs NWs deposited by drop casting over the SiO2/Si substrate. Source (S) and drain (D) electrodes were fabricated at different distances ranging from 1  μm up to 3.5  μm (device in the figure). These contacts could be operated both as electrical leads and resistive thermometers, thanks to their multi-contact arrangement. Consequently we could sample temperatures TS and TD at the two ends of the FET and the thermal bias ΔT = TD - TS. The four-wire thermometers were operated using a small AC current bias (≈  5  μA) and a phase-locked measurement technique while the DC transport along the NW was being simultaneously monitored. The doped Si substrate played the dual role of backgate electrode and differential heater. Two current injection leads H +  and H -  were used to establish a non-uniform current density in the substrate portion below the NW. By suitably tuning heater bias VH  ± we could control both the temperature jump along the wire (TD and TS were measured using the resistive thermometers) and the local backgate potential Vbg. Operation details and performance of the present heating scheme will be presented elsewhere, while further information on the devices and the measurement procedures are provided in the Methods and in the Supplementary Material sections.

As shown in Fig. 2a, the IV characteristics of our FETs were always linear within the explored electrical/thermal biasing ranges according to:

[formula]

where R is the NW resistance and Vt h = (S - SAu)ΔT is the thermovoltage due to the NW-Au thermocouple, S and SAu are the Seebeck coefficients of the NW and of the electrodes, respectively. Very large thermovoltages beyond - 1  mV were obtained and a strong modulation could be driven by field effect. The FET behavior was measured at temperatures ranging from 100  K up to 300  K (values were calculated as the average between TS and TD). Differential heating was obtained by applying a heater bias VH  ± = V0  ±  VH with respect to the device ground contact S. This led at the same time to a backgate potential Vbg  ≈  V0. The gating bias was also directly monitored by probes P1 and P2 in order to correct for any deviations from device symmetry. For every heating configuration (i.e. for a given VH value) a full backgate scan was performed stepping V0 from - 23  V to + 23  V with a relatively slow speed of about 1  V  /  min. At each gating value, an IV sweep was recorded in alternating directions, along with the back-gate voltage value Vbg(V0). Figure 2a shows the IV curves measured for the device in Fig. 1 with VH = 1.8  V which yielded TS = 288.6  K and TD = 276.1  K. The correspondence between V0 and the backgate voltage Vbg is shown in Fig. 2b: for this VH value Vbg  ≈  V0 - 0.377  V, the small difference being linked to the resistance drops at the H± contacts. From these data we can readily calculate thermovoltage Vt h(V0) and resistive slope R(V0). Figure 2c shows the resulting evolution of thermovoltage Vth versus resistance R.

Thanks to the direct measurement of temperatures TD and TS and to the large ΔT attainable, a rather precise mapping of S(σ,T) was determined for over 20 temperature values between 100  K and 320  K and for ΔT ranging from a minimum of [formula] to a maximum of [formula]. Figure 3a reports some of the curves obtained. Note that the small contribution due to SAu was subtracted using SAu = T  ·  6.4  nV  /  K2, a good approximation in the explored temperature regime [\cite=Mott]. In addition, σ was calculated as L / ((R - Rs)  ·  Σ), where Rs = 1  kΩ is the known series resistance of the measurement set-up (contact resistances are negligible with respect to R) and L = 2.6  ±  0.1  μm. The hexagonal NW section Σ was calculated as [formula], given 2r = 73  ±  7nm is the corner-to-corner "diameter" that was measured by scanning electron microscopy. The corresponding power factor S2σ is plotted in Fig.3b and peaks on the high-conductivity side of the graph. We also note that S displays a monotonic dependence on T for every given value of σ with an almost linear dependence on T. This is directly visible in Fig. 3c where S / T values show a good overlap and the slight sublinearity of S vs T becomes evident.

The overall evolution of the NW Seebeck coeffiecient can be understood starting from the approximate law

[formula]

which is valid for degenerate semiconductors in the low T limit [\cite=note02] [\cite=Mott]. Assuming that the temperature dependence of the mobility is small, this approximation would imply that S / T is temperature-independent: data in Fig. 3c indicate that such expectation is almost exactly valid in the present case. We compare the model with the lowest temperature dataset (T = 116.6  K) in the high band-filling regime (i.e. for large σ's), which is the one we expect to best comply with the model approximations. Since the mobility is the only free parameter of the model (see Supplementary Materials), this leads to an interesting μe estimate, with respect to the more standard one μe,F E derived from field-effect in transport. In the inset to Fig. 3c we compare experimental data with predictions for an energy-independent μe = 9000 - 13000  cm2  /  Vs, using no further adjustable parameters. A rather good agreement is obtained for [formula]. Note that since the prediction is sensitive to the density of states, it is important to stress that only a minor non-parabolicity can be expected at the corresponding band filling (along the visible red part of the curve, 80 to 120  meV from the Γ-point band edge).

Albeit this is an approximate fit and lower conductivity data would require at least to take quantum confinement and finite temperature effects into account, the present μe estimate is robust and very instructive. In fact this value can be directly compared with μe,F E, which we can determine in parallel starting from the Vbg dependence of the NW transconductance (see Supplementary Materials). This procedure was observed to lead to values lower than ≈  5000  cm2  /  Vs, for all explored Vbg and T regimes in the same NW. Such a sizable underestimate of field-effect mobility with respect to our fit procedure is robust despite the relatively strong approximation of energy-independent μe, since it is consistently observed across all explored filling regimes in the NWs, almost down to the pinch-off. This discrepancy was never directly measured but was discussed independently in recent works, where it was pointed out that estimates of the NW free-carrier density values obtained by field effect are usually significantly overestimated as a consequence of surface-charge screening effects [\cite=Blomers12] [\cite=Storm12] and non-ideal aspects of the gating geometry [\cite=Pitanti12]. In turn, this typically leads to a systematic underestimate of the carrier mobility. In this sense, the transport analysis discussed in Fig. 3 provides novel insight since it is largely independent from the influence of surface states. This is demonstrated by analyzing data in Fig. 4. Let us first examine R(Vbg) (panel (a)) and Vth(Vbg) (panel (b)) and compare data taken in the two opposite sweep directions at [formula] with [formula] and [formula]. No further parameter is modified during the measurement. A significant hysteresis is present in the Vbg dependence: this behavior is a consequence of the slow dynamics of surface states and traps, leading to a time-dependent screening of the gate [\cite=Roddaro08] [\cite=Karlstrom08]. Remarkably, despite the very large history-dependence of both Vth and R as a function of Vbg, the parametric trajectory in the Vth-R space is largely unaffected by sweep direction as shown Fig. 4(c). This confirms nicely that even if hysteresis affects the free-charge filling of the NW as a function of Vbg, it has a negligible effect on the other transport parameters such as the carrier mobility μe.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that large thermovoltages can be induced and tuned by gating in single-NW transistors. This result was obtained with a buried-heater scheme that makes it possible to impose both a large thermal bias ΔT and electric gating to the nanostructure. This experimental arrangement yielded a detailed mapping of S(σ,T) that was compared with classic models for thermoelectric transport in degenerate semiconductors. The adopted approximations led to a alternative estimate of electron mobility [formula] in the NW. This value is significantly larger than the one obtain by field-effect, μe,F E, on the same wire. The discrepancy can be understood in terms of the influence of slow surface- and trap-charge dynamics on field-effect mobility measurements, an influence that was shown to be negligible on S vs. σ dependence. The present results indicate that special care must be taken in the interpretation of transport results based on field-effects in these nanostructures.

Methods. InAs NWs were grown by metal assisted chemical beam epitaxy in a Riber C-21 reactor, using tertiarybutylarsine (TBAs) and trimetylindium (TMIn) as metalorganic precursors for group V and group III elements with line pressures of 3.00 and 0.90 Torr, respectively. Ditertiarybutylselenide (DtBSe) with a line pressure of 0.30 Torr was used as n-doping source. Devices were built starting from 80  nm-diameter InAs NWs deposited by drop casting over a SiO2/Si substrate. The substrate was heavily doped, with a resistivity ρ = 0.001 - 0.005  Ω   ·   cm, and was covered by a 280  nm-thick oxide. In a first lithographic step aligned to the NW, heater contacts (H+ and H- in Fig. 1) and the backgate voltage probes (P1 and P2) were defined by etching the SiO2 layer and depositing a Ni/Au (5  nm/25  nm) bilayer on the exposed Si. In the second step, the thermometers and all connections to the bonding pads were defined by a single evaporation of a Ti/Au 10/100  nm bilayer. Prior to evaporation the NW contact regions were exposed to an NH4Sx solution to passivate the surface and avoid the formation of an insulating oxide layer [\cite=Suyatin]. The device was operated in a chamber containing a small amount of exchange gas (He), inside a variable-temperature cryostat. The sample holder was equipped with a calibrated Si-diode thermometer which was used to measure the bath temperature and calibrate the two resistive thermometers at the S and D contacts. Details about the heater operation and about the precise thermal and electrical calibration procedures adopted for the experiments are reported in the Supplementary Materials.
