Ergodic Action Semigroups which Was Inspired by Pesin's Theory

Introduction

In classical dynamical systems, ergodicity and minimality are two central notations. On the other hand, since there is a relation between the action semigroups/groups and the classical dynamical systems, minimality and ergodicity for action semigroups/groups have been studied extensively by many authors (cf.  [\cite=bfs] [\cite=dkn] [\cite=fk] [\cite=kn] [\cite=s] [\cite=ss]).

Throughout this paper, M stands for a smooth compact Riemannian manifold and [formula] is normalized volume measure. Also, consider the spaces [formula] of all homeomorphisms on M endowed with C0-topology and [formula] (resp. [formula]) of all Cr-diffeomorphisms (resp. Cr-volume preserving diffeomorphisms) on M, endowed with Cr-topology.

Let [formula] a collection of homeomorphisms on M. Write [formula]. The action semigroup generated by F, with the composition of maps as its operation, is denoted by <  F  >  +. By this notation, the action group <  F  >   is defined by [formula].

For [formula], pick fi with probability pi, with 0  <  pi  <  1 and [formula]. A stationary measure μ for F is a measure that satisfies

[formula]

The notion of stationary measure for random dynamical systems is a generalization of the notion of invariant measure for classical dynamical systems. For a random dynamical system on a compact set, by an analog of the Krylov–-Bogolyubov procedure, a stationary measure always exists [\cite=km].

Let 〈F〉+ be an action semi-group generated by [formula].

〈F〉+ is minimal if every closed invariant set for 〈F〉+ is either empty or coincides with the whole space where a set A  ⊂  M is invariant for F if [formula].

〈F〉+ is ergodic with respect to a stationary measure μ if μ(A)∈{0,1} for all sets A  ⊂  M with [formula].

〈F〉+ is term-ergodic with respect to a quasi-invariant probability measure μ if μ(A)∈{0,1} for all sets A  ⊂  M with [formula] where a measure μ is said to be quasi-invariant if fμ is absolutely continuous with respect to μ for every element f in F.

The next theorem allows us to deal with the relationship between two concepts mentioned above, i.e. minimality and ergodicity, in some sense.

Suppose that 〈F- 1〉+ is minimal where [formula] and the following assumptions hold

〈F- 1〉+ contains an element h so that h has invariant measure ν with at least one open (mod 0) ergodic component C.

ν is a quasi-invariant (resp. invariant) measure for F- 1.

Then the 〈F〉+ is term-ergodic (resp. ergodic) with respect to ν.

One way to expressed an iterated function system is skew product systems over the shift on a symbol space. The step skew-product over the Bernoulli shift σ:(ωi)∞i = 0  ↦  (ωi + 1)∞i = 0 is defined by

[formula]

On one hand, the skew product system F+ admits an ergodic invariant product measure ν+  ×  μ, where ν+ is the Bernoulli measures on [formula]. On the other hand, by the following theorem, μ an ergodic stationary measure if and only if ν+  ×  μ is ergodic for F.

Let [formula] be a subset of [formula]. Then 〈F〉+ is ergodic with respect to the stationary measure μ if and only if the step skew product F is ergodic with respect to the invariant measure ν+  ×  μ.

For [formula], we say that a property holds Cr-robustly for 〈F〉+ on a set Λ if it holds for any family [formula] on set [formula] whose elements of [formula] are Cr-perturbations of elements of F and Λ is close to [formula] with Hausdorff metric.

One way to get ergodicity of the Lebesgue measure for a topological transitive ordinary dynamical system (f,M), is finding open sets (mod 0) in the ergodic components. This kind of approach to prove ergodicity was first introduced by Pesin [\cite=p]. By this approach, in [\cite=t], Tahzibi proved that that robustly transitive diffeomorphisms are robustly ergodic under the condition of the central Lyapunov exponents being of the same sign. The following theorem, speak about robustly ergodic iterated function systems without any information about the robustness of transitivity.

Suppose that 〈F- 1〉+ is minimal where [formula] and the following assumptions hold

〈F- 1〉+ contains an element h with at least one open (mod 0) ergodic component Λ.

the above assumption holds Cr-robustly for 〈F- 1〉+ on Λ for some [formula].

Then there exists an open set [formula] of [formula] so that for every [formula] the corresponding step skew product F:(ω,x)  ↦  (σ(ω),gω0(x)) ( resp. 〈F〉+) is ergodic with respect to [formula] (resp. [formula]).

Note that a sufficient condition for an ergodic component to be open (mod 0) is that the stable or unstable foliation of the system forms a C1-continuous lamination. Roughly speaking, it means that there are continuous positive function δ and r, such that for every x, the family of embeddings Φy:D  →  M that send a disk of dimension [formula] or [formula] to the local stable or unstable manifold of size δ(x) respectively is C1-continuous with y for all y∈B(x,r(x)).

The following corollary can be concluded immediately from Theorem [\ref=main] and Remark [\ref=rem].

Suppose that 〈F- 1〉+ is minimal where [formula] and 〈F- 1〉+ contains an element h so that the stable (or unstable) foliation forms a C1-continuous lamination. Then F:(ω,x)  ↦  (σ(ω),gω0(x)) is ergodic with respect to [formula].

Backward minimality & term-ergodicity: Theorem [\ref=local]

The next proposition and assumption ([\ref=it:2]) of Theorem [\ref=local], establish the phenomenon of ergodicity. Note that by  [\cite=kn] the minimality of 〈F〉+ is not equivalent to that of 〈F- 1〉+: there exists a minimal action semigroup 〈F〉+ on the circle such that 〈F- 1〉+ is not minimal. But, the minimality of 〈F- 1〉+ induces a property which acts like transitivity for ordinary dynamical systems. Clearly, backward minimality is stronger than transitivity, in some sense.

Suppose that 〈F- 1〉+ is minimal. Then for every open sets U,W there is a map T∈〈F〉+ so that [formula]. Moreover, the step skew product F:(ω,x)  ↦  (σ(ω),fω0(x)) is transitive.

By minimality of 〈F- 1〉+, for any open set U  ⊂  M and y∈M there exists Ty∈〈F- 1〉+ such that Ty(y)∈U. Now, using compactness of M, we get a finite set of maps [formula] so that

[formula]

So, there is a [formula] with [formula]. By taking T = Tj, the proof of the first part is complete.

It remains to prove transitivity of skew product. Let C  ×  U and [formula] be two arbitrary open sets in Σ+k  ×  M where [formula] are two cylinders belonging to Σ+k and U,V are two open sets in M. Notice that there exists [formula] so that σj(C) = Σ+k. Also, let ω∈C and [formula]. Take W = fjω(U). By the first part, there is T̂∈〈F〉+ with [formula]. So, there is a finite word [formula] so that [formula] and [formula].

Define [formula]. Since ρ∈C and [formula], one can have [formula].

Under the assumption of Theorem [\ref=local], if B is an open set then ν(B) > 0.

Let B be an open set with ν(B) = 0. Then there are [formula] so that

[formula]

Since ν is quasi for F- 1, one can get to μ(M) = 0 which is a contradiction.

To prove term-ergodicity of a quasi-measure for 〈F〉+ so that 〈F- 1〉+ is minimal, we need to find an open set (mod 0) in one ergodic component.

Let C be the open (mod 0) ergodic component of h∈〈F- 1〉+, that is there is an open set U with ν(UΔC) = 0 and f|C is ergodic with respect to ν. By Proposition [\ref=pro2], we ensure that 0 < ν(U) = ν(C).

To prove ergodicity of 〈F〉+, suppose that 0 < ν(B) < 1 and

[formula]

It follows that ν(h(B)ΔB) = 0. Thus, ν[null] = 0. The ergodicity of f|C implies that [formula]. So, one can have [formula].

Since U is an open set and ν is quasi-invariant for the 〈F- 1〉+, we insure that ν(B)∈{0,1} which is a contradiction.

Ergodicity of skew products: Theorem [\ref=main]

Since the volume measure is quasi-invariant for any C1-diffeomorphism, by Theorem [\ref=local], 〈F〉+ is ergodic with respect to [formula]. Also, by Theorem [\ref=okk], we insure that step skew product F:(ω,x)  ↦  (σ(ω),fω0(x)) is ergodic with respect to [formula].

Since the assumption ([\ref=it:11]) of Theorem [\ref=main] holds Cr-robustly for 〈F- 1〉+ on Λ and h is finite compositions of element of F- 1, there is a neighborhood [formula] so that action semi group generated by every element [formula] in W contains [formula] close to h with an open (mod 0) ergodic component Λ̂ close (Hausdorff metric) to Λ.

Now, let U be an open set with [formula]. By proposition [\ref=tran], there are [formula] so that

[formula]

Also, let V̂ be an open set with [formula]. Since {Ti(U)}mi = 1 is open cove of M, by shrinking W, one can sure [formula]. Apply the argument of Theorem [\ref=local] and get ergodicity of [formula]. Now, the results by Kifer [\ref=okk] implies that the step skew product G:(ω,x)  ↦  (σ(ω),gω0(x)) is ergodic.

Observe that minimality the 〈F- 1〉+ is enough to get our results. Actually, we do not need robustness of this property.
