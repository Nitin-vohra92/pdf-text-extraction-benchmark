Introduction and Definitions

Given a collection H of graphs, an H-decomposition of a graph G is a decomposition of the edge set of G into subgraphs isomorphic to the members of H. The copies of H∈H in the decomposition are called blocks. Such a decomposition is called resolvable if it is possible to partition the blocks into classes Pi (often referred to as parallel classes) such that every vertex of G appears in exactly one block of each Pi.

A resolvable H-decomposition of G is sometimes also referred to as an H-factorization of G, and a class can be called an H-factor of G. The case where H = K2 (a single edge) is known as a 1-factorization; for G = Kv it is well known to exist if and only if v is even. A single class of a 1-factorization, that is a pairing of all vertices, is also known as a 1-factor or perfect matching.

In many cases we wish to place further constraints on the classes. For example, a class is called uniform if every block of the class is isomorphic to the same graph from H. Of particular note is the result of Rees [\cite=R] which finds necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of uniform {K2,K3}-decompositions of Kv. Uniformly resolvable decompositions of Kv have also been studied in [\cite=DQS], [\cite=DLD], [\cite=GM], [\cite=HR], [\cite=KMT], [\cite=M], [\cite=S1] and [\cite=S2].

In this paper we study the existence of uniformly resolvable decompositions into paths P3 and cycles [formula] (both having three vertices) for the complete graph Kv and for the complete graph minus a 1-factor, which we denote by Kv - I. The existence of resolvable decompositions for each of P3 and K3 was studied separately already long ago:

There exists a resolvable K3-decomposition of Kv (called Kirkman Triple System, denoted as KTS(v)) if and only if  [formula].

There exists a resolvable K3-decomposition of Kv - I (called Nearly Kirkman Triple System, denoted as NKTS(v)) if and only if  [formula]  and v  >  12  [\cite=RS].

There exists a resolvable P3-decomposition of Kv if and only if  [formula]  [\cite=H].

There exists a resolvable P3-decomposition of Kv - I if and only if  [formula]. (This follows from the case v = 6 and from the spectrum of KTS(v) systems.)

Further results on resolvable path decompositions are given in [\cite=HR72].

Let now

G = Kv for v odd,

G = Kv - I for v even,

and let

URD(v;P3,K3) := {(r,s) : there exists a uniformly resolvable decomposition of G into r classes containing only copies of P3 and s classes containing only copies of K3}.

For [formula], divisible by 3, define I(v) according to the following table, where the first two lines are meant for v  ≥  18 only:

In this paper we completely solve the spectrum problem for such systems; i.e., characterize the existence of uniformly resolvable decompositions of Kv and Kv - I into r classes of 3-paths and s classes of 3-cycles, by proving the following result:

Main Theorem.

Notation.

In the constructive parts of the proof we shall use the following notation, where a1,a2,a3 may mean any three distinct vertices:

(a1,a2,a3) denotes the 3-cycle K3 having vertex set {a1,a2,a3} and edge set {{a1,a2},{a2,a3},{a3,a1}};

(a1;a2,a3) denotes the path P3 having vertex set {a1,a2,a3} and edge set {{a1,a2},{a1,a3}}.

Preliminaries and necessary conditions

In this section we introduce some useful definitions and give necessary conditions for the existence of a uniformly resolvable decomposition of Kv into P3 and K3 graphs. For missing terms or results that are not explicitly explained in the paper, the reader is referred to [\cite=CD] and its online updates. Evidently, for a uniformly resolvable decomposition of Kv into P3 and K3 graphs to exist, v must be a multiple of 3. A (resolvable) H-decomposition of the complete multipartite graph with u parts each of size g is known as a (resolvable) group divisible design H-(R)GDD; the parts of size g are called the groups of the design. When H  =  Kn, we call it an n-(R)GDD. A 3-RGDD of type gu exists if and only if g(u - 1) is even and [formula], except when (g,u)∈{(2,6),(2,3),(6,3)} [\cite=RS]. One can see, in particular, that a 3-RGDD of type 2u is a Nearly Kirkman Triple System (NKTS(2u)); we mentioned its spectrum in the Introduction.

Let  [formula]. If (r,s)∈URD(v;P3,K3) then (r,s)∈I(v).

For v odd, we have G = Kv. Let D be a decomposition of Kv into r classes of P3 and s classes of K3 graphs. Counting the edges of Kv that appear in D we obtain

[formula]

and hence that

[formula]

This equation implies that  [formula]  and  [formula]. Then we obtain

[formula]  and  [formula]  for  [formula],

[formula]  and  [formula]  for  [formula].

In either case, introducing the notation x = r / 3, the equation (1) determines that [formula] must hold. Since r and s cannot be negative, and x is an integer, the value of x has to be in the range as given in the definition of I(v).

Let  [formula]. If (r,s)∈URD(v;P3,K3) then (r,s)∈I(v).

For v even, we have G = Kv - I. The argument is similar to the one for v odd. Let D be a decomposition of Kv - I into r classes of P3 and s classes of 3-cycles. Counting the edges of Kv that appear in D we obtain

[formula]

and hence that

[formula]

This equation implies that  [formula]  and  [formula]. Then we obtain

[formula]  and  [formula]  for  [formula],

[formula]  and  [formula]  for  [formula].

In either case, denoting x = r / 3, the equation (2) yields [formula]. Since r and s cannot be negative, and x is an integer, the value of x has to be in the range as given in the definition of I(v).

Small cases

Here we handle the two exceptional cases, namely v = 6 and v = 12, for which the set I(v) is slightly more restricted than for larger v.

URD(6;P3,K3) = {(3,0)}.

The case r = 0 would correspond to an NKTS(6), which does not exist [\cite=RS]. On the other hand, for r = 3 and s = 0 we can take the groups to be {0,1},{2,3},{4,5} and the three classes {(0;2,4),(1;3,5)}, {(2;4,1),(3;5,0)}, (4;1,3),{(5;2,0)}.

URD(12;P3,K3) = {(3,3),(6,1)}.

The case r = 0 would correspond to an NKTS(12), which does not exist [\cite=RS]. For the other two cases, the following systems prove the assertion:

(3,3)∈URD(12;P3,K3):

{(1;6,a), (8;0,2), (3;4,9), (7;5,b)},  {(4;7,1), (5;2,b), (6;8,3), (9;0,a)}, {(0;4,5), (a;6,8), (b;1,3), (2;7,9)};  {(1,2,3), (4,5,6), (7,8,9), (0,a,b)}, {(1,5,9), (4,8,b), (3,7,a), (2,6,0)},  {(1,7,0), (2,4,a), (3,5,8), (6,9,b)}; I = {(1,8), (2,b), (3,0), (4,9), (5,a), (6,7)}.

(6,1)∈URD(12;P3,K3):

{(1;4,7), (5;8,0), (9;2,b), (a;3,6)},  {(2;6,8), (4;9,a), (7;3,0), (b;1,5)}, {(0;4,2), (3;5,9), (6;7,b), (8;1,a)},  {(1;5,6), (4;8,7), (9;0,a), (b;3,2)}, {(2;4,5), (6;9,8), (7;a,b), (0;1,3)},  {(3;4,6), (5;7,9), (8;0,b), (a;1,2)}; {(1,2,3), (4,5,6), (7,8,9), (0,a,b)}; I = {(1,9), (2,7), (3,8), (4,b), (5,a), (6,0)}.

Constructions for general v

The key tool in this section is the following important lemma. At the end of the paper we give some related information in the "Historical remarks and acknowledgements".

Let  [formula] [formula]. The union of any two edge-disjoint parallel classes of 3-cycles of Kv can be decomposed into three parallel classes of P3.

Let [formula] and [formula] be two edge-disjoint parallel classes of K3, whose union composes the edge set of graph G on v vertices. We represent the intersection structure of Q' and Q'' with a bipartite graph B with vertex bipartition [formula], where |X'| = |X''| = v / 3 and each vertex x'i∈X' and x''j∈X'' for 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  v / 3 corresponds to a block q'i∈Q' and q''j∈Q'', respectively. Vertex x'i is connected to vertex x''j by an edge of B if their corresponding blocks q'i and q''i have a vertex in common.

Every block of Q' (Q'') meets exactly three distinct blocks of Q'' (Q') because each vertex appears in precisely one block of Q' and also of Q'', and no vertex pair of G is contained in blocks of both classes. Thus, B is a 3-regular bipartite graph. Moreover, the edges of B are in one-to-one correspondence with the vertices of G, and G is the line graph of B. We are going to define three edge decompositions of B, each of them being the union of v / 3 mutually edge-disjoint copies of P4 starting in X' and ending in X'', in such a way that each intersecting edge-pair of B occurs together in precisely one of those 3  ×  v / 3 copies of P4. Since G is the line graph of B, this will yield the three parallel classes of P3 as required.

It follows from the König-Hall theorem [\cite=B] that the edge set of B can be decomposed into three edge-disjoint perfect matchings; we view this as a proper 3-edge-coloring with three colors, say colors a, b, and c. We define

Pabc  =  {paths P4 in B, starting in X', whose color sequence is (a,b,c) in this order}.

This Pabc is well-defined and yields an edge decomposition of B indeed, because each color class is a perfect matching. We define Pbca and Pcab analogously, replacing the sequence (a,b,c) with (b,c,a) and (c,a,b), respectively.

It is easy to verify that the three edge decompositions Pabc, Pbca, Pcab of B satisfy the requirements. For example, if an edge ea of color a meets an edge ec of color c in B, then they are consecutive in one P4 of Pbca if [formula] or in one P4 of Pcab if [formula] (and they are not consecutive in any other P4 of [formula]).

For every  [formula], I(v)  ⊆  URD(v;P3,K3).

Let R1, R2, ,[formula] be the parallel classes of a resolvable KTS(v). Define

[formula]

for  [formula], and

[formula]

for  [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=lemmaC] we know that each Si and each Ti can be decomposed into three parallel classes of P3. Thus, in order to generate a member [formula] of I(v), we apply the lemma to [formula] or to [formula], depending on the residue of v modulo 12. The range given above for i covers the entire range of x in I(v).

For every  [formula], I(v)  ⊆  URD(v;P3,K3).

Start with a A 3-RGDD of type 2v / 3 [\cite=RS]. This gives that Kv - I can be decomposed into [formula] parallel classes of triples. Now the result can be easily obtained by using an argument similar to the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemmaC1].

Conclusion

We are now in a position to prove the main result of the paper.

For every  [formula], we have URD(v;P3,K3) = I(v).

Necessity follows from Lemmas [\ref=lemmaP1] and [\ref=lemmaP2]. Sufficiency follows from Lemmas [\ref=lemmaD1], [\ref=lemmaD2], [\ref=lemmaC1] and [\ref=lemmaC2]. This completes the proof.

Historical remarks and acknowledgements.

This research was done in the summer of 2012, when the second author visited the University of Catania. After the presentation of our results at the Seventh Czech-Slovak International Symposium on Graph Theory, Combinatorics, Algorithms and Applications (Ko sice, July 2013), we learned from Alex Rosa that Lemma [\ref=lemmaC] was first proved by Rick Wilson. Later, Wilson informed us that he never published the lemma, but it was mentioned with full credit to him in a paper by John van Rees [\cite=W]. We thank professors Rosa and Wilson for these pieces of information.
