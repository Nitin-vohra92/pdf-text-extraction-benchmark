Electric current generation in distorted graphene

ELECTRIC CURRENT GENERATION IN DISTORTED GRAPHENE

Introduction

In less than a decade from the emergence of the so-called Dirac and Weyl Materials -among which graphene[\cite=graphene] [\cite=Gusynin:2007ix] and more recently, topological insulators[\cite=topins], have attracted considerable attention, a renewed interest within both the elementary particle and condensed matter physics has developed around the behavior of planar fermions, which have transited from being toy models of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) under extreme conditions to actual players of a revolutionary era for fundamental physics and technological application prospects.

Graphene and related materials are composed by a single layer of atoms tightly packed into a two-dimensional honeycomb array and therefore can be efficiently described by tight-binding models. In the continuum limit, these models can be mapped into the Hamiltonian of (2 + 1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED3) with massless Dirac fermions.[\cite=Gusynin:2007ix] A variety of traditional condensed matter phenomena found an effective description in terms of the QED3 degrees of freedom, including high-Tc superconductivity[\cite=supercon] and quantum Hall effect.[\cite=QHE] It was, however, the gapless nature of the charge carriers in graphene at low energy, which around the Dirac points of the Brillouin zone of the honeycomb lattice exhibit a linear dispersion relation what boosted the interest on the properties of "relativistic" planar fermions in a condensed matter environment.

Although being Abelian, QED3 exhibits similar features to non-Abelian gauge theories, hence establishing a link between particle physics and condensed matter systems. Therefore, QED3 opens the possibility to explore phenomena which are either inaccessible, due to energy limitations, or hard to measure in a particle physics experiment. Indeed, it is known that at very high temperatures, a non-Abelian gauge theory coupled to Nf fermion families in (3+1)-space-time dimensions experiences a dimensional reduction to an effective (2+1)-dimensional theory, which further "abelianizes" if Nf is large enough[\cite=pisarski]; non-abelian interactions are suppressed by a factor of N- 1f. This fact makes QED3 an effective version of QCD, which also exhibits important non-perturbative phenomena like confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking.[\cite=nonpertQED3] In particular, in the same way as it happens in QCD, the Lagrangian of QED3 admits a non-trivial Chern-Simons (CS) term[\cite=CST] which manifests itself as a gauge boson mass of topological nature, thus allowing for the possibility of time reversal and (generalized) parity breaking, fractional statistics and so on (see, for instance, Ref. ).

In this work we propose that, for some planar systems effectively described by QED3 in the presence of an external in-plane magnetic field, it occurs a mechanism which manifests itself as the generation of a non-dissipative electric current along the direction of the magnetic field. Such a current has a topological nature, and may be regarded as the analogue for a bi-dimensional system of an effect proposed in the context of the quark gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions, known as chiral magnetic effect (CME).[\cite=CME] The effect we describe is not related with the spin of charge carriers, but pseudospin. We refer to it as pseudochiral magnetic effect (PCME).

The PCME in graphene

The CME is characterized by the interaction between the topological gauge fields and the fermions (in this case, deconfined quarks), that causes a flip in the chirality of the latter, generating domains of homogeneous chirality. Because in (3+1)-dimensions, chirality in the massless limit corresponds to helicity, a relation between the directions of spin and momentum is established, and in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field, the magnetic alignment of spins the spins with it generates an electric current in the field direction.

In the massless Dirac theory, where γ5 commutes with the Hamiltonian, the chirality quantum number is a conserved quantity and it is possible to define a representation where the spinors that describe the quasiparticle excitations are eigenstates of γ5. In (2+1)-dimensions it is not possible to perform rotations around the direction of the momentum and the spin operator loses its usual physical meaning. In other words, the concept of helicity related to Lorentz group and real space rotations is meaningless. However, one can still construct an operator that commutes with the Hamiltonian and has the chiral conserved quantum number as its eigenvalue. In analogy with the spin in (3+1)-dimensions, this is called pseudospin operator and corresponds to an internal symmetry rather than to spatial symmetry.[\cite=Gusynin:2007ix] In this case, the eigenstates of the γ5 operator are the spinors that, in the case of monolayer graphene, represent the quasiparticle excitation at the two inequivalent Dirac points in the first Brillouin zone of the graphene honeycomb, K+ and K-, and therefore the pseudohelicity can be seen as a flavor label corresponding to each one of the Dirac points. Considering the prescription described above, a breaking of the pseudohelicity symmetry in planar systems corresponds to an imbalance between the inequivalent Dirac points, which can be, for instance, by generating different effective masses for each one of them.

Electrons in crystal lattices behave like quasiparticles, which means that their interactions can be represented by effective masses. Generally speaking, in graphene-like materials, beyond the free electron picture, masses or gaps can be opened through a variety of external perturbations, e.g. strong enough magnetic fields, but also through mechanical distortion of the underlying lattice structure.[\cite=Geim:2013] A total of 36 gap-opening instabilities of the Dirac type in the spin, valley and superconducting channels have been considered in graphene and graphene-like structures (see Ref.  and references therein). To establish the pseudohelicity symmetry breaking, we are particularly interested in mechanisms that generate different masses for the inequivalent Dirac points. A physical realization of this prescription is given in Ref. , where the authors propose to place the graphene membrane over a hexagonal boron nitride layer, that is conformed in such a way that its lattice coincides with the graphene honeycomb lattice, generating a different effective mass for the charge carriers from different points K+ and K-. Such an inequivalence has proven to be valid, for instance, for strained graphene, where pseudomagnetic fields are generated in terms of effective masses [\cite=strain]. In fact, the effect of intrinsic curvature of the graphene membrane at the level of the equations of motion of charge carriers can be considered as if these particles develop an effective masses in flat space [\cite=curvature]. In the same way, in this work we consider a generalized deformed graphene layer aligned with a magnetic field permeating it. Schematically shown in Fig. [\ref=fig1], the deformations and distortions of the honeycomb lattice can be described as a perfectly planar system by the inclusion of Haldane masses.

Representing the pseudohelicity breaking in terms of a field theory, we look for a combination of masses in the Lagrangian, among all those allowed for such systems, that results in different masses for each eigenstate of the chiral operator. The particular choice of the masses proportional to γ3 and γ3γ5 generates this pseudochirality imbalance, still keeping the Lagrangian invariant under the pseudochiral transformation ψ  →  eiθγ5ψ. An interesting feature about the mass proportional to γ3γ5 is that it generates a CS term in the gauge sector of the Lagrangian, as well as a CS term generates this mass term in the fermion Lagrangian.[\cite=CH-DW] Therefore, the chosen mass term structure reinforces our analogy with the CME in QCD, where the CS term is also responsible for the breaking of helicity symmetry.

Lagrangian with planar magnetic field

Completing the analogy, we require a Lagrangian that includes a magnetic field with field lines pointing along the graphene plane. Unlike the case of quantum Hall effect with a magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene sheet, the gauge field that generates this in-plane magnetic field can depend on the coordinate perpendicular to the plane. Besides brane-world scenarios, where gauge invariance is guaranteed by construction (see Ref.  and references therein), an appropriate treatment is to extend the theory to a (3+1)-dimensional space-time with a compactified dimension, and then perform a strict dimensional reduction. An extended dimensionality is a more realistic scenario in the sense that graphene indeed has an effective thickness besides the corrugations. However, if we want to consider the intersection of this external classical gauge field with the plane directly, there is no SO(1,3) gauge symmetry anymore, the [formula] component decouples from the other gauge vector components and now the gauge components [formula], [formula], [formula] are constrained to an SO(1,2) symmetry [\cite=Abreu:2001dq].

This scenario is similar to what is observed in high temperature dimensional reduction, where the A0 component decouples from the other gauge vector fields.[\cite=Andersen:1995ej] The correct way to deal with this situation is to choose a gauge which does not depend on the perpendicular coordinate. In this case the dimensional reduction is guaranteed and therefore we can treat the system as a (2+1)-dimension one scketched in Fig. [\ref=fig1].

Considering an external magnetic field homogeneous in space and time, the only gauge component that generates the planar magnetic field is [formula], since contribution from other vector components must depend on the dynamics of the transverse dimension. If the external magnetic field points in the x-direction, we choose the Landau-like gauge [formula], where the curl of this gauge field generates the in-plane magnetic field and its coordinate dependence is also in the plane. The other external electromagnetic components are still gauge invariant.

The resulting general chiral invariant Lagrangian, in Minkowski space, is:

[formula]

where [formula], e is the fundamental charge, vF is the Fermi velocity and μ the chemical potential. The fields ψ are 8-component spinors which correspond to the direct product spin[formula]pseudospin. As we do not include spin interactions, spin label will not be treated explicitly in what follows, but must be taken into account. For simplicity we will set vF = 1 or, in other words, vF will be the new speed of light. Notice that because we describe the propagation of negative charge-carriers (quasiparticles and not holes), the chemical potential must be positive.

Recalling the discussion in the previous section, the presence of a CS term automatically generates the mass mo in the fermion Lagrangian. This mass is referred to in literature as the odd mass[\cite=CH-DW] regarding its parity non-preserving character. The mass term m3 reproduces the asymmetry between the sub-lattices generated by, for example, placing the graphene membrane on top of a hexagonal boron nitride layer.[\cite=boron-nitride]

Green Function

In the Weyl representation for the gamma matrices, the charge carriers Lagrangian can be separated in two chiralities:

[formula]

with the fields and masses defined as [formula] and m±  =  m3  ±  mo. The Green function in configuration space can be written in terms of the combination of the Green function of each chirality as

[formula]

where the chiral Green functions are defined as

[formula]

with [formula]. Since the operators Π0 and Π1 commute with the other operators involved, Π2 and [formula], we can introduce a set of eigenstates |k0〉 and |k1〉. The chiral Green functions, then, can be written as

[formula]

where we have introduced the Hamiltonian in the proper-time method, defined as

[formula]

and where the parallel momentum vectors are defined as [formula] and [formula]. The last term of the above equation is the responsible for the effect we are proposing and is independent of the gauge choice if we deal with an extended (3+1)-dimensional theory with one compactified dimension.

As it is well-known, some care must be taken when dealing with a chemical potential using the proper time method in a uniform magnetic background.[\cite=chodos] The reason is that when the chemical potential is larger than the fermion mass, the propagator must be regularized in a certain μ-dependent way. The time-ordered regulator is defined setting k0  →  k0(1 + ε). As a consequence, in the denominator of Eq. ([\ref=Gc-2]), [formula]. So, in order to express the denominator as an integral of an exponential term, the convergence will be determined by the sign of k0(k0  +  μ). This can be written in a simple way as

[formula]

where the regulation function, defined as

[formula]

ensures the correct convergence of the integral in the proper time. Now, the Schwinger proper-time method [\cite=schwinger] can be performed in the usual way by identifying the y-coordinate states as 〈y| = 〈y(s)| and |y'〉 = |y'(0)〉. We write the resulting chiral Green functions in an appropriate form:

[formula]

where

[formula]

The term [formula] is a nonlocal factor along the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field on the plane.

The effects of a thermal bath are introduced by the replacements k0  →  iωn, and [formula], where ωn = (2n + 1)πT are the Matsubara frequencies, and the time component t  →   - iτ is now compactified in the region [formula] . The regulator for the proper-time can be introduced with the same analysis and the replacement is

[formula]

In the case of zero temperature in Euclidean space, the procedure follows the same line: k0  →   - ik4 introducing the regulator in rs( - k4μ).

Current densities

Let us now calculate the currents. A current density is defined as

[formula]

where the trace is taken over spin and pseudospin indexes and where the operator Γ can be γμ,γμγ5,γ3,γ3γ5. The dependence on y, explicitly indicated in Eq. ([\ref=currents]), appears due to the nonlocal term in the chiral Green function in Eq. ([\ref=Gc3]) and ([\ref=tildeG]).

Our model, even in the absence of a magnetic field, presents some non-vanishing expectation values: the particle number density n = 〈ψ†ψ〉 due to the chemical potential; the condensates σ3  =  〈γ3ψ〉 and σo  =  〈γ3γ5ψ〉 generated through the masses m3 and mo, respectively; and the chiral number density n5  =  〈ψ†γ5ψ〉, due to the combination of chemical potential and masses. The presence of the uniform external magnetic field along the x-direction catalyzes the generation of two other currents along the same direction: an electric current jx  =   - e〈γ1ψ〉 and an axial current j5x  =   - e〈γ1γ5ψ〉, which is expected in analogy with the CME produced in QCD. We explore these currents in more detail below.

Following the expressions for the Green function in Eq. ([\ref=G]), ([\ref=Gc3]) and ([\ref=tildeG]), tracing over spin and pseudospin, we can write the electric induced current density and the axial current density as

[formula]

with y±  =   - m± / eB, and where the function j reads

[formula]

Note that the role of the spin in this case is simply to duplicate the degrees of freedom and it is not involved in any interaction.

It is possible to rotate the proper time integral in the complex plane at finite temperature. Following the restrictions imposed by the regulator rs defined in Eq. ([\ref=rs]) and ([\ref=rT]), we separate the proper time integral into the negative and positive ranges of integration. If ω2n  >  μ2, the integrals can be enclosing the contour in the lower complex plane. If ω2n  <  μ2, the contour of integration encloses in the upper complex plane. Both results are different, so, if we want a single expression for all the Matsubara frequencies, we must restrict ourselves to the condition πT  >  μ. The function j in this case can be written as

[formula]

The integral above is highly suppressed by the exponential term e- s(ω2n  -  μ2), where the range s < (πT)2  -  μ2 dominates. If |eB| < (πT)2  -  μ2, the product eBs is too small in the relevant integration region. Then, we can make the approximation tanh (eBs)  ≈  eBs simplifying enormously ([\ref=j_rotated]), allowing us to integrate the proper time. After summing all the Matsubara frequencies we get this simple result:

[formula]

being nF the Fermi-Dirac distribution.

The total electric current along the x direction, following , is then

[formula]

being Ly the size of the plane in the y direction.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we present here a new transport mechanism for systems represented by (2+1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics in the presence of an external in-plane uniform magnetic field. The systems considered present topological deformations represented by a CS term which induces a mass term proportional to γ3γ5 as well as sub-lattice deformations represented by a mass gap proportional to γ3. We showed that the presence of an external in-plane magnetic field in such configuration generates an electric current along the field lines. Such a phenomenon can be regarded as an analogue of the CME proposed for QCD.

On one hand, the PCME has potential technological applications on material physics. On the other hand, because heavy ion collisions environment possess intrinsic ambiguities on the observables related to the non-trivial vacuum of QCD, the condensed matter systems offer a more controlled environment that can provide valuable insight on the knowledge of the QCD vacua. Our expectations are that phenomena like the one we describe can shed light on the issue.
