Introduction

Dyson's rank [\cite=Dyson-1944] and the Andrews-Garvan-Dyson crank [\cite=Andrews-Garvan-1988] are two fundamental statistics in the theory of partitions. For a partition [formula], the rank of λ, denoted r(λ), is the largest part of λ minus the number of parts. The crank c(λ) is defined by

[formula]

where n1(λ) is the number of ones in λ and μ(λ) is the number of parts larger than n1(λ).

Andrews [\cite=Andrews-07-a] introduced the symmetrized moments η2k(n) of ranks of partitions of n given by

[formula]

where N(m,n) is the number of partitions of n with rank m.

In view of the symmetry N( - m,n) = N(m,n), we have η2k + 1(n) = 0. As for the even symmetrized moments η2k(n), Andrews [\cite=Andrews-07-a] showed that for fixed k  ≥  1, η2k(n) is equal to the number of (k + 1)-marked Durfee symbols of n. Kursungoz [\cite=Kursungoz-2011] and Ji [\cite=Ji-2011] provided the alternative proof of this result respectively. Bringmann, Lovejoy and Osburn [\cite=Bringmann-2010] defined two-parameter generalization of η2k(n) and k-marked Durfee symbols. In [\cite=Andrews-07-a], Andrews also introduced the full rank of a k-marked Durfee symbol and defined the full rank function NFk(r,t;n) to be the number of k-marked Durfee symbols of n with full rank congruent to r modulo t.

The full rank function NFk(r,t;n) have been extensively studied and they posses many congruence properties, see for example, [\cite=Bringmann-2008] [\cite=Bringmann-Garvan-Mahlburg-2009] [\cite=Bringmann-2010] [\cite=Bringmann-Kane-2012] [\cite=Keith-2009]. Recently, Bringmann, Garvan and Mahlburg [\cite=Bringmann-Garvan-Mahlburg-2009] used the automorphic properties of the generating functions of NFk(r,t;n) to prove the existence of infinitely many congruences for NFk(r,t;n). More precisely, for given positive integers j, k  ≥  3, odd positive integer t, and prime Q not divisible by 6t, there exist infinitely many arithmetic progressions An + B such that for every 0  ≤  r < t, we have

[formula]

Since

[formula]

by ([\ref=nfk]), we see that there exist an infinite family of congruences for η2k(n), namely, for given positive integers k and j, prime Q > 3, there exist infinitely many non-nested arithmetic progressions An + B such that

[formula]

Analogous to the symmetrized moments ηk(n) of ranks, Garvan [\cite=Garvan-2011] introduced the k-th symmetrized moments μk(n) of cranks of partitions of n in the study of the higher-order spt-function sptk(n). To be more specific,

[formula]

where M(m,n) denotes the number of partitions of n with crank m for n > 1. For n = 1 and m  ≠   - 1,0,1, we set M(m,1) = 0; otherwise, we define

[formula]

It is clear that μ2k + 1(n) = 0, since M(m,n) = M( - m,n).

In this paper, we give a combinatorial interpretation of μ2k(n). We first introduce the notion of k-marked Dyson symbols based on a representation for ordinary partitions given by Dyson [\cite=Dyson-1944]. We show that for fixed k  ≥  1, μ2k(n) equals the number of (k + 1)-marked Dyson symbols of n. Moreover, we define the full crank of a k-marked Dyson symbol and define full crank function NCk(r,t;n) to be the number of k-marked Dyson symbols of n with full crank congruent to r modulo t. We prove that for fixed prime p  ≥  5 and positive integers r and k  ≤  (p + 1) / 2, there exists infinitely many non-nested arithmetic progressions An + B such that for every 0  ≤  i  ≤  pr - 1,

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

so that from [\eqref=nck] we can deduce that there exist an infinite family of congruences for μ2k(n), that is, for fixed prime p  ≥  5, positive integers r and k  ≤  (p - 1) / 2, there exist infinitely many non-nested arithmetic progressions An + B such that

Dyson symbols and k-marked Dyson symbols

In this section, we introduce the notion of k-marked Dyson symbols. A 1-marked Dyson symbol is called a Dyson symbol, which is a representation of a partition introduced by Dyson [\cite=Dyson-1989]. For 1  ≤  i  ≤  k, we define the i-th crank of a k-marked Dyson symbol. Moreover, we define the function [formula] to be the number of k-marked Dyson symbol of n with the i-th crank equal to mi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. The following theorem shows that the number of k-marked Dyson symbols of n can be expressed in terms of the number of Dyson symbols of n.

For fixed integers [formula], we have

[formula]

For a partition [formula], let [formula] denote the number of parts of λ and |λ| denote the sum of parts of λ. A Dyson symbol of n is a pair of restricted partitions (α,β) satisfying the following conditions:

If [formula], then β1  =  β2;

If [formula], then α1 = 1;

If [formula], then α1  =  α2;

[formula].

When we display a Dyson symbol, we shall put α on the top of β in the form of a Durfee symbol [\cite=Andrews-07-a] or a Frobenius partition [\cite=Andrews-1984].

For example, there are 5 Dyson symbols of 4:

[formula]

There is a bijection Ω between the set of partitions of n and the set of Dyson symbols of n.

For completeness, we give a proof of the above theorem.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=dy-op]: Let [formula] be a partition of n. A Dyson symbol (α,β) of n can be constructed via the following procedure. There are two cases.

Case 1: One is not a part of λ. We set [formula] and β  =  λ'.

Case 2: One is a part of λ. Assume that one occurs M times in λ. We decompose the Ferrers diagram of λ into three blocks as illustrated in Figure 2.1, where N is the number of parts of λ that are greater than M. In this case, we see that [formula], where λN > M, λN + 1  ≤  M and 1M means M occurrences of 1. Then remove all parts equal to one from λ and insert a new part M, so that we get a partition [formula] as shown in Figure 2.2.

Now the partitions α and β can be obtained from μ. First, let [formula], and let [formula]. Then we get [formula], where ν' the conjugate of ν, see Figure 2.2.

It is easy to verify that (α,β) is a Dyson symbol of n and the above procedure is reversible, and hence the proof is complete.

For a Dyson symbol (α,  β), Dyson [\cite=Dyson-1989] considered the difference between the number of parts of α and β, which we call the crank of (α,  β). Let F1(m;n) denote the number of Dyson symbols of n with crank m. Dyson [\cite=Dyson-1989] observed the following relation based on the construction in Theorem [\ref=dy-op].

A k-marked Dyson symbol is defined as the following array

[formula]

consisting of k pairs of partitions (α(i),β(i)) and a partition [formula] subject to the following conditions:

The smallest part of p equals 1, that is, [formula].

For 1  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1, each part of α(i) and β(i) is between pi - 1 and pi, namely,

[formula]

Each part of α(k) and β(k) is no less than pk - 1, namely,

[formula]

If [formula] then α(k)1 = pk - 1 ; If [formula] then α(k)1  =  α(k)2 ; If [formula] and [formula], then β(k)1 = pk - 1; If [formula] and [formula], then β(k)1  =  β(k)2 ; If [formula] and [formula], then pk - 1  =   max {α(k - 1)1,β(k - 1)1}.

For example, the array below

[formula]

is a 3-marked Dyson symbol.

We next define the weight of a k-marked Dyson symbol. Recall that for a pair of partitions (α,β) with [formula], a balanced part βi of β is defined recursively as follow. If the number of parts greater than βi in α is equal to the number of unbalanced parts before βi in β, that is, the number of unbalanced parts βj with 1  ≤  j < i; otherwise, we call βi is an unbalanced part, see [\cite=Ji-2011]. We use b(α,β) to denote the number of balanced parts of (α,β).

For example, for the pair of partitions

[formula]

the first part 3 of β is balanced, and the second part 2 and the third part 2 are unbalanced. Therefore, b(α,β) = 1.

We now define the i-th crank and the i-th balanced number of a k-marked Dsyon symbol. Let

[formula]

be a k-marked Dyson symbol. The pair of partitions (α(i),β(i)) is called the i-th vector of η. For 1  ≤  i  ≤  k, we define ci(η), the i-th crank of η, to be the difference between the number of parts of α(i) and β(i), that is, [formula].

For 1  ≤  i < k, we define bi(η), the i-th balanced number of η by

[formula]

For i = k, we set bk(η) = 0.

For the 3-marked Dyson symbol η in [\eqref=exam-eta], we have c1(η) =  - 1,  c2(η) = 0,  c3(η) = 2 and b1(η) = 1,  b2(η) = 1,  b3(η) = 0.

For 1  ≤  i  ≤  k, we define li(η), the i-th large length of η by

[formula]

Similarly, we define the i-th small length si(η) of η by

[formula]

The weight of k-marked Dyson symbol is defined by

[formula]

where

[formula]

For example, the weight of the 3-marked Dyson symbol η in [\eqref=exam-eta] equals 97.

For a k-marked Dyson symbol η, if the weight of η equals n, we call η a k-marked Dyson symbol of n. We can now define the function [formula] as the number of k-marked Dyson symbols of n with the i-th crank equal to mi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. Note that a 1-marked Dyson symbol is a Dyson symbol and F1(m;n) = M( - m,n). The following theorem shows the function [formula] has the mirror symmetry with respect to each mj.

For n  ≥  2, k  ≥  1 and 1  ≤  j  ≤  k, we have

[formula]

Proof. The above identity is trivial for mj = 0. We now assume that mj > 0. Let [formula] denote the set of k-marked Dyson symbols of n counted by [formula] mk;n). We aim to build a bijection Λ between the set [formula] and the set [formula].

Let

[formula]

be a k-marked Dyson symbol in [formula]. To define the map Λ, we need to construct a new j-th vector ((j),(j)) from (α(j),β(j)). There are four cases.

Case 1: 1  ≤  j  ≤  k - 1. Set (j)  =  β(j) and (j)  =  α(j).

Case 2: j = k and [formula]. In this case, we have α(k)1 = pk - 1 and [formula]. Set [formula] and (k)  =  α(k).

Case 3: j = k, [formula] and [formula]. Let t = β(k)1  -  β(k)2. Set

[formula]

Case 4: j = k, [formula] and [formula]. Let t = β(k)1 - pk - 1. Set

[formula]

From the above construction, it can be checked that

[formula]

Then Λ(η) is defined as

[formula]

Hence Λ(η) is a k-marked Dyson symbol in [formula]. Furthermore, it can be seen that the above process is reversible. Thus Λ is a bijection.

We are now ready to prove Theorem [\ref=main], which says that the number of k-marked Dyson symbols of n can be expressed in terms of the number of Dyson symbols of n. This theorem is needed in the combinatorial interpretation of μ2k(n) given in Theorem [\ref=main-w-4]. By Theorem [\ref=mirror-sym], we see that Theorem [\ref=main] can be deduced from the following formula.

For n  ≥  2 and [formula], we have

[formula]

To prove the above theorem, we introduce the structure of strict k-marked Dyson symbols. Recall that a strict bipartition of n is a pair of partitions (α,β) such that αi  >  βi for [formula] and |α| + |β| = n. Note that for a strick bipartition (α,β) we have [formula]. For example,

[formula]

is a strict bipartition.

Strict bipartitions are the building blocks of strict k-marked Dyson symbols. For k  ≥  2, let

[formula]

be a k-marked Dyson symbols of n. If (α(i),β(i)) is a strict bipartition for any 1  ≤  i < k, we say that η a strict k-marked Dyson symbol of n.

Notice that there is no balanced part in a strict bipartition. Consequently, if η is a strict k-marked Dyson symbol, then the i-th balanced number bi(η) of η equals zero for 1  ≤  i < k. To prove Theorem [\ref=main-p-f], we define a function [formula] as the number of strict k-marked Dyson symbols of n with the i-th crank equal to mi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k and define a function [formula] as the number of k-marked Dyson symbols of n with the i-th crank equal to mi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k and the i-th balance number equal to ti for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1. The relation stated in Theorem [\ref=main-p-f] can be established via two steps as stated in the following two theorems.

For n  ≥  2, k  ≥  2, [formula] and [formula], we have

[formula]

For n  ≥  2, k  ≥  2 and [formula], we have

[formula]

To prove Theorem [\ref=lem-1], we need a bijection in [\cite=Ji-2011]. Let P(r;n) denote the set of pairs of partitions (α,β) of n where there are r balanced parts and [formula], and let Q(r;n) denote the set of strict bipartitions (,) of n with [formula] Given two positive integers n and r, there is a bijection ψ between P(r;n) and Q(2r;n). Furthermore, the bijection ψ possesses the following properties. For (α,β)∈P(r;n), let (,) = ψ(α,β). Then we have

[formula]

We next give a proof of Theorem [\ref=lem-1] by using the bijection ψ.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=lem-1]. Let [formula] denote the set of k-marked Dyson symbols of n with the i-th crank equal to mi and the i-th balanced number equal to ti, and let [formula] denote the set of strict k-marked Dyson symbols of n with the i-th crank equal to mi. We proceed to define a bijection Ω between [formula] and [formula].

Let

[formula]

be a k-marked Dyson symbol in [formula]. For 1  ≤  i < k, we apply the bijection ψ described above to (α(i),β(i)) to get a pair of partitions ((i),(i)). From the properties of the bijection ψ, we see that((i),(i)) is a strict bipartition and

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then Ω(η) is defined to be

[formula]

By [\eqref=alph1], we see that that for 1  ≤  i < k - 1, each part of (i) and (i) is between pi - 1 and pi, namely,

[formula]

It is also clear from [\eqref=llalpha] that the i-th crank of Ω(η) is equal to mi + 2ti for 1  ≤  i < k and the k-th crank of Ω(η) is equal to mk. Using ([\ref=llalpha]) again, we get

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus the weight of Ω(η) is equal to

[formula]

which is in accordance with the definition of |η|. So Ω(η) is in [formula]. Since ψ is a bijection, it is readily verified that Ω is also a bijection, and hence the proof is complete.

We now turn to the proof of Theorem [\ref=lem-2].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=lem-2]. Recall that [formula] denotes the set of strict k-marked Dyson symbols of n with the i-th crank equal to mi and H1(m;n) denotes the set of Dyson symbols of n with crank m. To establish a bijection Φ between [formula] and [formula], let

[formula]

be a strict k-marked Dyson symbol in [formula]. Let α be the partition consisting of all parts of [formula] together with [formula], and let β be the partition consisting of all parts of [formula]. Then Φ(η) is defined to be (α,β). From the definition of k-marked Dyson symbols, we see that (α,β) is a Dyson symbol. It is also easily seen that

[formula]

and

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=dif-lengt] that

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=dif-lengt] and [\eqref=dif-weight], we deduce that the weight of (α,β) equals

[formula]

This proves that (α,β) is a Dyson symbol in [formula].

We next describe the reverse map of Φ. Let

[formula]

be a Dyson symbol in [formula]. We proceed to show that a strict k-marked Dyson symbol η can be recovered from the Dyson symbol (α,β).

First, we see that the k-th vector (α(k),β(k)) of η and pk - 1 can be recovered from (α,β). Let jk be largest nonnegative integer such that βjk  ≥  αmk + jk + 1, that is, for any i  ≥  jk + 1, we have βi  <  αmk + i + 1. Define

[formula]

Obviously, [formula]

To recover (α(k - 1),β(k - 1)) and pk - 1, we let

[formula]

By the choice of jk, we find that αmk + jk + i + 1  >  βjk + i for any i, in other words, α'i  >  β'i. Consequently, (α',β') is a strict bipartition. Then (α(k - 1),β(k - 1)) and pk - 1 can be constructed from (α',β'). Let jk - 1 be the largest nonnegative integer such that β'jk - 1  ≥  α'mk - 1 + jk - 1 + 1. Define

[formula]

Now we have [formula]. Since (α',β') is a strict bipartition, we deduce that (α(k - 1),β(k - 1)) is a strict bipartition.

The above procedure can be repeatedly used to determine [formula] (α(2),β(2)),p1,(α(1),β(1)). The k-marked Dyson symbol η can be defined as

[formula]

It can be checked that η is a strict k-marked Dyson symbol in [formula]. Moreover, it can be seen that Φ(η) = (α,β), that is, Φ is indeed a bijection. This completes the proof.

Here is an example to illustrate the reverse map Φ- 1. Assume that m1 = 1,m2 = 1,m3 = 0, and

[formula]

which a Dyson symbol of 127, that is, (α,β)∈H1(4;127). From (α,β), we get

[formula]

Based on (α',β'), we get

[formula]

Finally, we obtain It can be checked that η∈Q3(1,1,0;127).

A combinatorial interpretation of μ2k(n)

In this section, we use Theorem [\ref=main] to give a combinatorial interpretation of μ2k(n) in terms of k-marked Dyson symbols.

For k  ≥  1 and n  ≥  2, μ2k(n) is equal to the number of (k + 1)-marked Dyson symbols of n.

Proof. By definition of [formula], the assertion of the theorem can be stated as follows

[formula]

Using Theorem [\ref=main], we see that the left-hand side of [\eqref=w-3-eq-1] equals

[formula]

Given k and n, let ck(j) denote the number of integer solutions to the equation

[formula]

in [formula] and [formula] subject to the further condition that [formula] are nonnegative. It can be shown that generating function of ck(j) is equal to

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Substituting j by m - k, we get

[formula]

Thus [\eqref=3.2] simplifies to

[formula]

Using Corollary [\ref=core-dyson] and noting that M( - m,n) = M(m,n), we conclude that

[formula]

which equals μ2k(n), as claimed.

For example, for n  =  5 and k  =  1, we have μ2(5) = 35, and there are 35 2-marked Dyson symbols of 5 as listed in the following table.

[formula]

[formula]

Congruences for μ2k(n)

In this section, we introduce the full crank of a k-marked Dyson symbol. We show that there exist an infinite family of congruences for the full crank function of k-marked Dyson symbols.

To define the full crank of a k-marked Dyson symbol η, denoted FC(η), we recall that ck(η) denotes the k-th crank of η, l(η) denotes the large length of η and s(η) denotes the small length of η and D denotes the balanced number of η. Then FC(η) is given by

[formula]

It is clear that for k = 1, the full crank of a 1-marked Dyson symbol reduces to the crank of a Dyson symbol.

Analogous to the full rank function for a k-marked Durfee symbol defined by Andrews [\cite=Andrews-07-a], we define the full crank function NCk(i,t;n) as the number of k-marked Dyson symbols of n with the full crank congruent to i modulo t. The following theorem gives an infinite family of congruences of the full crank function.

For fixed prime p  ≥  5 and positive integers r and k  ≤  (p + 1) / 2. Then there exist infinitely many non-nested arithmetic progressions An + B such that for each 0  ≤  i  ≤  pr - 1,

[formula]

Since

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=conguren-main] implies the following congruences for μ2k(n).

For fixed prime p  ≥  5, positive integers r and k  ≤  (p - 1) / 2. Then there exists infinitely many non-nested arithmetic progressions An + B such that

[formula]

To prove Theorem [\ref=conguren-main], let NCk(m;n) denote the number of k-marked Dyson symbols of n with the full crank equal to m. In this notation, we have the following relation.

For n  ≥  2, k  ≥  1 and integer m,

[formula]

Proof. Recall that [formula] is the number of k-marked Dyson symbols of n such that for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k, the i-th crank equal to mi and the i-th balance number equal to ti. By the definition of NCk(m,n), we see that if m  ≥  1, then we have

[formula]

where the summation ranges over all integer solutions to the equation

[formula]

in [formula] and [formula] subject to the further condition that mk is positive and [formula] are nonnegative.

Combining Theorem [\ref=lem-1] and Theorem [\ref=lem-2], we find that

[formula]

Substituting [\eqref=4.4] into [\eqref=4.2], we get

[formula]

where the summation ranges over all solutions to the equation [\eqref=4.3]. Let k(m - k + 1) denote the number of integer solutions to the equation [\eqref=4.3]. It is not difficult to verify that

[formula]

Thus, [\eqref=labelck] simplifies to

[formula]

Using Corollary [\ref=core-dyson] and noting that M( - m,n) = M(m,n), we conclude that

[formula]

as required. Similarly, it can be shown that relation [\eqref=NCk&Ck] also holds for m  ≤  0.

Let M(i,t;n) denote the number of partitions of n with the crank congruent to i modulo t. The following congruences for M(i,t;n) given by Mahlburg [\cite=Mahlburg-2005] will be used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=conguren-main].

For fixed prime p  ≥  5 and positive integers τ and r, there are infinitely many non-nested arithmetic progressions An + B such that for each 0  ≤  m  ≤  pr - 1,

[formula]

We are now ready to complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=conguren-main] by using Theorems [\ref=thm4.3] and [\ref=Mahl-thm].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=conguren-main]. For 0  ≤  i  ≤  pr - 1, by the definition of NCk(i,pr;n), we have

[formula]

Replacing m by prt + i in [\eqref=NCk&Ck], we get

[formula]

Substituting [\eqref=4.7] into [\eqref=4.6], we find that

[formula]

Since p is a prime and k  ≤  (p + 1) / 2, we see that (2k - 2)! is not divisible by p. It follows that

[formula]

Thus [\eqref=NCk&Ck-2] implies that

[formula]

Setting τ = r in Theorem [\ref=Mahl-thm], we deduce that there are infinitely many non-nested arithmetic progressions An + B such that for every 0  ≤  i  ≤  pr - 1

[formula]

Consequently, there are infinitely many non-nested arithmetic progressions An + B such that for every 0  ≤  m  ≤  pr - 1

[formula]

and hence the proof is complete.
