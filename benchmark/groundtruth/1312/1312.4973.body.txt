Introduction

A resolving set for a graph Γ = (V,E) is a set of vertices [formula] such that for each vertex w∈V, the list of distances [formula] uniquely determines w. Equivalently, S is a resolving set for Γ if, for any pair of vertices u,w∈V, there exists vi∈S such that [formula]; we say that vi resolves u and w. The metric dimension of Γ is the smallest size of a resolving set for Γ. This concept was introduced to the graph theory literature in the 1970s by Harary and Melter [\cite=Harary76] and, independently, Slater [\cite=Slater75]; however, in the context of arbitrary metric spaces, the concept dates back at least as far as the 1950s (see Blumenthal [\cite=Blumenthal53], for instance). In more recent years, there has been a considerable number of papers written about the metric dimension of graphs. For further details, the reader is referred to the survey paper [\cite=bsmd].

When studying metric dimension, distance-regular graphs are a natural class of graphs to consider. A graph Γ is distance-regular if, for all i with [formula] and any vertices u,v with [formula], the number of neighbours of v at distances i - 1, i and i + 1 from u depend only on the distance i, and not on the choices of u and v. For more information about distance-regular graphs, see the book of Brouwer, Cohen and Neumaier [\cite=BCN] and the forthcoming survey paper by van Dam, Koolen and Tanaka [\cite=vanDam]. Note that the class of distance-regular graphs contains the distance-transitive graphs (i.e. those graphs Γ with the property that for any vertices u,v,u',v' such that [formula], there exists an automorphism g such that ug = u' and vg = v') and the connected strongly regular graphs (which are the distance-regular graphs of diameter 2).

For any graph Γ with diameter d, consider the partition of V  ×  V into d + 1 parts, given by the pairs of vertices at each possible distance in Γ. If Γ is distance-regular, this partition is an example of an association scheme. These are much more general objects, and ones which are inconsistently named in the literature; see [\cite=bsmd] for more details. An association scheme is said to be P-polynomial if it arises from a distance-regular graph; however, more than one graph may give rise to the same P-polynomial association scheme (see [\cite=BCN] [\cite=vanDam]). It is not difficult to see that two graphs arising in this way must have the same metric dimension (see [\cite=bsmd]).

Since the publication of the survey paper by Cameron and the present author [\cite=bsmd], a number of papers have been written on determining, or bounding, the metric dimension of various families of distance-regular graphs: see [\cite=imprimitive] [\cite=jk] [\cite=grassmann] [\cite=Beardon] [\cite=FengWang] [\cite=GuoWangLi] [\cite=GuoWangLi2] [\cite=Heger], for instance. The purpose of this paper is to give the results of a number of computer calculations, using the GAP computer algebra system [\cite=gap], which have obtained the metric dimension for all "small" distance-regular graphs (i.e. on up to 34 vertices), for distance-regular graphs of valency 3 and 4 (on up to 189 vertices), low-valency distance-transitive graphs (up to valency 13, and up to 100 vertices), and certain other distance-regular graphs. For strongly regular graphs, this has included an independent verification of earlier computations by Kratica et al. [\cite=Kratica08] (which used an entirely different approach via linear programming).

Known results

In this section, we summarize the relevant known values of the metric dimension of various families of distance-regular graphs. It is a straightforward exercise to verify that the complete graph Kn has metric dimension n - 1, that the complete bipartite graph Km,n has metric dimension m + n - 2, and that a cycle Cn with n  ≥  3 vertices has metric dimension 2. The following result is also straightforward, yet the author is not aware of it appearing anywhere in the literature.

Consider a complete multipartite graph [formula] with r parts of sizes [formula], for r > 1. Then the metric dimension of Γ is [formula].

In particular, in the special case where a complete multipartite graph has r parts of size m (and thus is strongly regular), this shows that the metric dimension is r(m - 1).

Suppose the vertex set of Γ is [formula], where the Vi are disjoint sets of sizes [formula]; every possible edge exists from Vi to Vj (for i  ≠  j), and no edges exist inside any Vi. Let T be a transversal of [formula], and let [formula]. It is straightforward to verify that S is a resolving set for Γ of size [formula]. Furthermore, no smaller resolving set may exist: suppose for a contradiction that R is a subset of V with size smaller than the above. By the pigeonhole principle there exists an index i for which Vi contains two vertices u,v not in R, and no vertex in R will resolve this pair of vertices.

The following results are somewhat less trivial. Recall that the Johnson graph J(n,k) is the graph whose vertex set consists of all k-subsets of an n-set, and two k-subsets are adjacent if and only if they intersect in a (k - 1)-subset. The Kneser graph K(n,k) has the same vertex set as J(n,k), but adjacency is defined by two k-sets being disjoint. The Johnson graph is always distance-regular, whereas the Kneser graph only is in two special cases, namely K(n,2) (which is the complement of J(n,2)) and K(2k + 1,k) (known as the Odd graph, and usually denoted Ok + 1). The following result was obtained by Cameron and the present author in 2011.

For n  ≥  6, metric dimension of the Johnson graph J(n,2) and Kneser graph K(n,2) is [formula], where [formula], i∈{0,1,2}.

It is easy to determine the metric dimension of J(3,2), J(4,2) and J(5,2) by hand: these values are 2, 3 and 3, respectively. Further results about resolving sets for Johnson and Kneser graphs may be found in [\cite=jk].

We also recall that the Hamming graph H(d,q) has as its vertex set the collection of all d-tuples over an alphabet of size q, and two d-tuples are adjacent if and only if they differ in exactly one position; these graphs are distance-transitive. Two important examples are the hypercube H(d,2) and the square lattice graph H(2,q). The following result was obtained by Cáceres et al. in 2007.

For all q  ≥  1, the metric dimension of the square lattice graph H(2,q) is [formula].

This is the only infinite family of Hamming graphs for which the metric dimension is known precisely. Further details about the metric dimension of Hamming graphs can be found in [\cite=bsmd]; for the hypercubes, see also Beardon [\cite=Beardon]. Some precise values were computed by Kratica et al. [\cite=Kratica09], using genetic algorithms.

Finally, we mention a recent result of the present author, which helps to eliminate the need for some additional computations. The bipartite double of a graph Γ = (V,E) is a bipartite graph D(Γ), whose vertex set consists of two disjoint copies of V, labelled V+ and V-, with v+ adjacent to w- in D(Γ) if v and w are adjacent in Γ.

Suppose Γ is a distance-regular graph of diameter d, and whose shortest odd cycle has length 2d + 1. Then Γ and its bipartite double D(Γ) have the same metric dimension.

In particular, the graph Kn,n - I (obtained by deleting a perfect matching from Kn,n) is the bipartite double of the complete graph Kn, which satisfies the conditions of Theorem [\ref=thm:double], and thus Kn,n - I has metric dimension n - 1.

The method

Suppose Γ = (V,E) is a graph with n vertices, labelled [formula]. The distance matrix of Γ is the n  ×  n matrix A, whose (i,j) entry is the distance in Γ from vi to vj. Note that if there are two distance-regular graphs arising from the same P-polynomial association scheme, their distance matrices are equivalent, up to a relabelling of the distance classes. For instance, the metric dimension of a primitive strongly regular graph and that of its complement will be equal.

Suppose A is the distance matrix of Γ, and let S be a subset of V. Denote by S the submatrix formed by taking the columns of A indexed by elements of S. It is clear that S is a resolving set for Γ if and only if the rows of S are distinct. Furthermore, if one has obtained the distance matrix of a relatively small graph, it is near-instantaneous for a computer to verify if a given submatrix has this property.

The results given below were obtained using the computer algebra system [formula] [\cite=gap] and various packages developed for it, in particular the GRAPE package of Soicher [\cite=grape], the functions for association schemes of Hanaki [\cite=Hanaki-gap], and also some functions of Cameron [\cite=cameron-gap]. However, the most useful tool for these computations is the SetOrbit package of Pech and Reichard [\cite=setorbit]. Given a set V and a group G acting on it, this provides an efficient method for enumerating a canonical representative of each orbit of G acting on the subsets of V of a given size. It is clear that S is a resolving set for a graph Γ if and only if its image Sg  =  {xg  :  x∈S} is a resolving set, for any [formula]. Consequently, when searching for a resolving set of a particular size, it suffices to test just one representative of each orbit on subsets of that size. Therefore, the methods of Pech and Reichard (which are explained in detail in [\cite=PechReichard]) are precisely what is needed to dramatically reduce the search space.

Data sources

Hanaki and Miyamoto's library of small association schemes [\cite=Hanaki-data] contains all distance-regular graphs on up to 34 vertices: one merely has to filter out the P-polynomial examples from their lists. Association schemes with primitive automorphism groups may be constructed by using GAP's internal libraries of primitive groups. Graphs (such as incidence graphs and point graphs) obtained from generalized polygons may be constructed using the FinInG package of Bamberg et al. [\cite=fining], while for graphs associated with block designs (including projective and affine geometries) the DESIGN package of Soicher [\cite=design] is used. Other useful data sources include Spence's catalogue of strongly regular graphs [\cite=spence], Royle's catalogue of symmetric (i.e. arc-transitive) cubic graphs [\cite=Royle], the online Atlas of Finite Group Representations [\cite=wwwATLAS], and Sloane's libraries of Hadamard matrices [\cite=sloane].

Results

Distance-regular graphs on up to 34 vertices

As mentioned above, all distance-regular graphs on up to 34 may all be obtained from the catalogue of association schemes of Hanaki and Miyamoto [\cite=Hanaki-data]. For 31 and 32 vertices, a complete classification of association schemes is not available; however, as there are no feasible parameter sets for strongly regular graphs with these numbers of vertices, and (other than K31 and C31) no distance-transitive graphs with 31 vertices, one can see that the data available contains all distance-regular graphs with 31 and 32 vertices. These graphs are all small enough that no sophisticated computations were required to determine the metric dimension; the results are given in Tables [\ref=table:smalldrg1] and [\ref=table:smalldrg2]. Cycles, complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs and complete multipartite graphs are omitted from these tables. Those graphs which are not distance-transitive are indicated [formula]; cases where there is a unique distance-transitive example are indicated ‡. The abbreviation IG is used to denote an incidence graph.

Distance-regular graphs of valency 3 and 4

The distance-transitive graphs of valency 3 were determined by Biggs and Smith in 1971 [\cite=BiggsSmith71] (see also Gardiner [\cite=Gardiner75]); this classification was extended to all distance-regular graphs of valency 3 by Biggs, Boshier and Shawe-Taylor in 1986 [\cite=Biggs86]. In addition to K4 and K3,3, there are eleven such distance-regular graphs, of which all but one are distance-transitive, with the exception being Tutte's 12-cage. The metric dimension of each of these graphs is given in Table [\ref=table:valency3].

The distance-transitive graphs of valency 4 were determined in 1974 by Smith [\cite=Smith73] [\cite=Smith74a] [\cite=Smith74b] (see also Gardiner [\cite=Gardiner85]); this classification was extended to distance-regular graphs by Brouwer and Koolen in 1999 [\cite=BrouwerKoolen]. The classification is complete, except for relying on a classification of generalized hexagons GH(3,3), which give rise to 4-regular distance-regular graphs on 728 vertices. (In any case, these would be beyond the scope of the computations in this paper.) The metric dimension of each of these graphs is given in Table [\ref=table:valency4].

Of the graphs with more than 34 vertices, the Foster graph was obtained from Royle's catalogue [\cite=Royle], the Biggs-Smith graph from its automorphism group [formula], and Tutte's 12-cage as the incidence graph of the generalized hexagon GH(2,2) (constructed using FinInG). The Odd graph O4 lies inside the Johnson scheme J(7,3), which may be constructed using GRAPE, as can line graphs and bipartite doubles. The incidence graph of the GQ(3,3) may be constructed using FinInG.

Distance-transitive graphs of valencies 5 to 13

The distance-transitive graphs of valencies 5, 6 and 7 were determined in 1986 by Faradjev, Ivanov and Ivanov [\cite=Faradjev86], and independently (for valencies 5 and 6) by Gardiner and Praeger [\cite=GardinerPraeger86] [\cite=GardinerPraeger87]. For valencies 8 to 13, the classification was obtained in 1988 by Ivanov and Ivanov [\cite=Ivanov88].

Tables [\ref=table:valency5] to [\ref=table:valency13] contain the metric dimension of all such graphs on up to 100 vertices (apart one exception on 98 vertices), as well as larger graphs when the computations succeeded. No table is provided for valency 11, as the only example under 100 vertices (other than K12 or K11,11) is K12,12 - I, which has metric dimension 11. An asterisk indicates that the metric dimension was not computed directly, but rather that Theorem [\ref=thm:double] was applied to the result of an earlier computation.

Of the examples with more than 34 vertices, many of the graphs are incidence graphs of designs or geometries, so can be constructed using the DESIGN or FinInG packages; the resolvable transversal designs [formula] and [formula] are given in the paper of Hanani [\cite=Hanani74]. Otherwise, graphs were constructed in GAP from their automorphism groups, either from the internal libraries of primitive groups, or using permutation representations in the Atlas.

Strongly regular graphs on up to 45 vertices

Recall that a strongly regular graph Γ has parameters (n,k,a,c), where n is the number of vertices, k is the valency, a is the number of common neighbours of a pair of adjacent vertices, and c is the number of common neighbours of a pair of non-adjacent vertices. In this subsection, we consider the strongly regular graphs on between 35 and 45 vertices, for parameters where a complete classification of graphs are known, and obtain their metric dimension; the results are given in Table [\ref=table:srg]. (Smaller strongly regular graphs were considered in Tables [\ref=table:smalldrg1] and [\ref=table:smalldrg2] above.) These graphs were obtained from the online catalogue of Spence [\cite=spence]. This forms an independent verification of the earlier calculations of Kratica et al. [\cite=Kratica08]; however, we do not consider strongly regular graphs with parameters (37,18,8,9), as it is unknown if the 6760 known graphs form the complete set. (The Paley graphs on 37 and 41 vertices are considered in the next subsection.)

Rank-3 strongly regular graphs with up to 100 vertices

A graph which is both strongly regular and distance-transitive is called a rank-3 graph, as its automorphism group has permutation rank 3 (see [\cite=Cameron99]). Other than a complete multipartite graph, such a graph necessarily has a primitive automorphism group, and as GAP contains a library of all primitive groups on up to 2499 points (as obtained by Roney-Dougal [\cite=RoneyD05]), it is straightforward to construct rank-3 graphs with a (relatively) small number of vertices. For this paper, we considered the rank-3 graphs with up to 100 vertices; the metric dimension of each of these graphs is given in Table [\ref=table:rank3]. (For the Higman-Sims graph on 100 vertices, the exact value was not determined, but an upper bound of 14 was obtained; the author suspects this is the exact value.)

Hadamard graphs

A Hadamard matrix of order k is a k  ×  k real matrix H with entries ±  1 and the property that HHt  =  kI. Such a matrix must have order 1, 2 or a multiple of 4 (it is conjectured that all multiples of 4 are admissible). From a Hadamard matrix H of order k  ≥  4, the associated Hadamard graph Γ(H) has 4k vertices {r+i,r-i,c+i,c-i  :  1  ≤  i  ≤  k}, with r+i  ~  c+i and r-i  ~  c-i if Hij = 1, and r+i  ~  c-i and r-i  ~  c+i if Hij =  - 1. This graph is bipartite and distance-regular, with diameter 4 and valency k; for further details, see [\cite=BCN].

Using Sloane's library of Hadamard matrices, one can easily construct the corresponding Hadamard graphs in [formula]. The metric dimension for the Hadamard graphs arising from Hadamard matrices of orders from 4 to 20 is given in Table [\ref=table:hadamard] below. In each case considered, Hadamard graphs of the same order had the same metric dimension.
