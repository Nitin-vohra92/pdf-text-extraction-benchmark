A remark on the Cox ring of [formula]

Introduction

Let [formula] be the moduli space of stable rational curves with n ordered distinct marked points. After [\cite=HuKe], Question 3.2, it has been an intriguing open problem to establish whether [formula] is a Mori dream space. Indeed, an affirmative answer is only known for n  ≤  6 (see [\cite=Cas]), which is just the range of n for which [formula] is a (smooth) log-Fano variety. On the other hand, according to the very recent e-print [\cite=CasTev], [formula] is not a Mori dream space for n > 133 (at least in characteristic zero).

Here instead we present an elementary proof of the following fact:

The graded algebra

[formula]

is finitely generated for every n  ≥  3.

As kindly pointed out to us by Maksym Fedorchuk, such a statement cannot hold without any restriction on the index A. Indeed, since for every [formula] and for any m >  > 0 we have

[formula]

with all cA  ≥  0 and ci  ≥  0 (see for instance [\cite=Moon], Lemma 2.9 (2)), it turns out that

[formula]

Our inductive argument works for n  ≥  5 and relies on a vanishing

[formula]

(see Lemma [\ref=vanishing] below for a more precise statement).

We are grateful to Edoardo Ballico, James McKernan and Jenia Tevelev for carefully reading a previous version of our manuscript and pointing out to us that such a vanishing definitely does not hold for n = 4, since [formula] for k  ≥  2. We are also grateful to Marco Andreatta, Luca Benzo and Gilberto Bini for inspiring conversations on the subject of the present note.

We work over an algebraically closed field [formula] of arbitrary characteristic.

The proofs

The boundary of [formula] is the union of irreducible divisorial components

[formula]

where [formula], A  ⊂  P and η is the natural morphism obtained by glueing the points p and q into an ordinary node. According to [\cite=ArbCor], Lemma 3.3 (see also [\cite=Moon], Lemma 2.5), we have:

[formula]

and

[formula]

while for every B different from both A and [formula]:

[formula]

Let n  ≥  5. For every cA  ≥  0 and every ci  ≥  0 we have

[formula]

We argue by induction on [formula].

If [formula], then we need to check that

[formula]

In order to do so, we make induction on [formula]. Indeed, if [formula], then we have [formula] since [formula] is a smooth rational variety and the irregularity is a birational invariant. Assume now [formula], so that cz  >  0 for some z. We know that ψz is the class of an effective divisor E (see for instance [\cite=ArbCor], (3.7)):

[formula]

with z∈A and x,y∉A for any choice of distinct elements [formula]. In particular, E has dimension dim (E) = n - 4  ≥  1, is both reduced and connected (indeed, all such DA intersect D{x,y}) and by ([\ref=psi]) ψz|DA  =  (ψz,0). Hence from the standard short exact sequence

[formula]

we deduce

[formula]

with

[formula]

both equal to either [formula] if [formula] or to 0 if [formula]. As a consequence, we obtain an exact sequence

[formula]

and ([\ref=basis]) follows by induction on [formula].

Assume now [formula]. Among all boundary divisors DA with 4  ≤  |A|  ≤  (n + 1) / 2 such that cA  >  0, choose DB minimizing |B|. We may write the short exact sequence

[formula]

and deduce

[formula]

Now, by inductive assumption on [formula] we have

[formula]

On the other hand, according to ([\ref=inductive]), we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

by applying ([\ref=psi]), ([\ref=self]) and ([\ref=boundary]) and recalling our choice of DB such that B minimizes |B|. Hence by Künneth formula we obtain

[formula]

with

[formula]

by ([\ref=basis]) and

[formula]

since cB  >  0, hence also

[formula]

and the claim follows.

As a consequence of Lemma [\ref=vanishing], from ([\ref=short]) we obtain a short exact sequence

[formula]

for every boundary divisor DB with 4  ≤  |B|  ≤  (n + 1) / 2, so that all restriction maps

[formula]

are surjective with kernel

[formula]

The idea of the next crucial technical result has been inspired by [\cite=Fuj], Chapter I., Theorem (2.3).

If for every [formula] such that 4  ≤  |B|  ≤  (n + 1) / 2 the graded algebras

[formula]

are finitely generated by homogeneous elements ρB(γBj) for [formula] N(B), then the graded algebra

[formula]

is finitely generated by (the sections corresponding to) the boundary divisors DB together with the elements γBj for every B and j.

Let S  ⊆  A be the subalgebra generated by all sections sB with DB  =  {sB = 0} and by all γBj. In order to prove that S  =  A, we are going to check that the following equality holds for all homogeneous components:

[formula]

We argue by induction on [formula].

If [formula], then [formula] equals either [formula] if [formula] or 0 if [formula] and in both cases there is nothing to prove. Thus assume [formula], in particular there is B with 4  ≤  |B|  ≤  (n + 1) / 2 such that cB  >  0. By ([\ref=restriction]) and ([\ref=kernel]), the vector space

[formula]

is generated by

[formula]

and by a set of elements γBj such that ρB(γBj) generate

[formula]

hence the claim follows by induction on [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]. We argue by induction on n, starting from the trivial cases n  ≤  6 and then applying Proposition [\ref=generation] for n  ≥  7.
