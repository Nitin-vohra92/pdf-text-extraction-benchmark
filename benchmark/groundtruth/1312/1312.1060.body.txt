An Algebraic Study of Linkages with Helical Joints

Introduction

Linkages, and in particular closed linkages, are a crucial object of study in the modern theory of kinematics. The use of algebra and geometry for studying linkages is very classical and goes back to Sylvester, Kempe, Cayley and Chebyshev.

A linkage, as appearing in robotics/mechanical engineering, biology, as well as modelling of molecules in chemistry, etc., is a mechanical structure that consists of a finite number of rigid bodies - its links - and a finite number of joints that connect the links together, so that they possibly produce a motion. A linkage is called closed if its number of links and joints are equal and they are connected cyclically. We consider four types of joints:

(R) revolute joints: allow rotations around a fixed axes;

(P) prismatic joints: allow translations in a fixed direction;

(C) cylindrical joints: allow rotations around a fixed axes and translations in the the direction of the axes;

(H) helical joints: allow the motions of a cylindrical joint where the rotation angle and the translation length are coupled by a linear equation.

We will use the notation R-joint for a revolute joint, and similarly for other types. Note that the dimensions of the set of allowed motions (the degree of freedom) is 1 for joints of type R, P, and H, and 2 for C-joints.

The configuration set of a closed linkage L, denoted by KL, is the set of possible simultaneous motions of all joints (see Definition [\ref=conf] for a precise description). The dimension of KL is called the mobility of L, and L is called mobile if the mobility is positive.

It is known that KL can be described by analytic equations; see [\cite=seligbook], page 356. If there are no H-joints, then we also have a description by algebraic equations. We refer to [\cite=history] for a historic overview of the use of geometric algebra in kinematics. This is the subject that has attracted algebraists the most. It should be mentioned, however, that also number theory has been used for studying linkages: in [\cite=gs], reduction modulo prime numbers are considered in order to construct a new family of Stewart-Gough platforms. Below, in Section [\ref=sec:bonds] we briefly explain the algebraic setup, as well as the theory of bonds, a rather new combinatorial technique that has shown to be very useful for analysing closed linkages with R-joints [\cite=hss2]. We also explain the analytical relations in the presence of H-joints. There are also other (numerical) algebraic methods that are applied in kinematics, see for example [\cite=bpsc] [\cite=res] [\cite=ws].

A closed linkage with n joints, where all joints are R-joints, is denoted by nR-linkage. We denote by n-linkage a linkage with n joints where no information on the type of joints is specified. It is easy to imagine that a 3R-linkage does not have a motion, and hence its configuration set is trivial. On the other hand a generic nR-linkage for n  ≥  7 has positive mobility (see [\cite=seligbook], page 356), and hence there is not much to study. So the interesting cases are when n = 4,5 or 6. Nowadays we have a full classification of 4R- and 5R-linkages with mobility one (dim KL = 1), and we know many cases for n = 6 (see [\cite=dietmaier]). It is an open research problem to classify all 6R-linkages. These classification problems are considered by algebraists. Because of the nature of other types of linkages it seemed difficult, or rather impossible, to be able to use any of the present algebraic techniques for linkages with H-joints.

The mobile linkages with 4 joints of type H, R, or P have been classified in [\cite=Delassus]. Here (more precisely in Theorem [\ref=thm:h5]) we give a classification of mobile linkages with 5 joints of type H, R, or P. Using our main result, we reduce to linkages with joints of type R or P only. The classification of mobile 5R-linkages has been done in [\cite=Karger], but for linkages with both R-joints and P-joints, we could not find a complete classification in the literature. On the other hand, this classification is not difficult when we use the theory of bonds, so we also give it in here (Theorem [\ref=thm:p]).

Because the two proofs of the classification results, i.e., Theorem [\ref=thm:p] and Theorem [\ref=thm:h5], are methodically quite different, it is possible to apply a "filter" while reading in case one is only interested in the main result (or in one of the proofs using Ax's theorem). In that case, the reader could omit the second half of Section [\ref=sec:bonds], right before bonds are introduced, and the whole Section [\ref=non-helical], except for Theorem [\ref=thm:p] which has to be taken for granted.

Algebraic set up

In this section we set up the notation for an algebraic description of linkages with arbitrary joints. Then we briefly recall bonds for R-joints as defined in [\cite=hss2]. Finally, we introduce bonds for P-joints and prove some basic properties of them.

Dual quaternions and configuration set

Suppose [formula] is the set or real numbers, [formula] is the ring of dual numbers and ε2 = 0. Denote by [formula] the non-commutative algebra of quaternions, where

[formula]

Let [formula] denote the dual quaternions, i.e.

[formula]

We call A the primal part of a dual quaternion h, and B the dual part of h. The conjugate of [formula], as above, is defined by [formula]. This extends naturally to define the conjugate dual quaternion of h by

[formula]

The norm function [formula] is then defined by [formula]; and the latter is called the norm of h.

Note that [formula] can be regarded as a real 8-dimensional vector space, and projectivising [formula] we obtain [formula]. The Study quadric S is a hypersurface of this projective space defined by the quadratic equation

[formula]

where [formula]. In other words

[formula]

The linear 3-space represented by all dual quaternions with zero primal part is denoted by E. It is contained in the Study quadric, and the complement S - E is closed under multiplication and multiplicative inverse; hence S - E forms a group, which is isomorphic to the group of Euclidean displacements (see [\cite=husty10]).

For a natural number [formula], a linkage with n joints is described as an n-tuple [formula], where each ji represents a joint. We will use cyclic notation for joint indices, i.e., jn + 1 = j1.

Quantisation

The type of joint specifies which data must be given in order to determine the set of possible motions, as follows. Suppose [formula].

If jk is an R-joint, then we specify a dual quaternion hk such that h2k =  - 1. We write pk and qk for the primal and the dual part of hk, i.e., hk = pk  +  εqk with [formula]. The set of possible motions is parametrized by the joint parameter [formula], which is the rotation with an angle of 2 arccot (tk). The rotation corresponds to the dual quaternion mk = tk - hk, and to 1 if tk  =    ∞  . Note that the latter means we have fixed the initial position at ∞  .

If jk is a P-joint, then we specify a quaternion [formula] such that p2k =  - 1. The set of possible motions is parametrized by the joint parameter [formula], and the translation corresponds to the dual quaternion mk = 1 - εskpk.

If jk is a C-joint, then we specify a dual quaternion hk = pk  +  εqk such that h2k =  - 1, The set of possible motions is parametrized by the joint parameters (sk,tk) and corresponds to the dual quaternion mk = (1 - εskpk)(tk - hk).

If jk is an H-joint, then we specify a dual quaternion hk = pk  +  εqk such that h2k =  - 1, and a nonzero real number gk. The number [formula] is often refereed to as the pitch in mechanical engineering. The joint parameter is [formula], and the motion corresponds to the dual quaternion [formula].

The data which must be specified for all joints are called the geometric parameters. Note that when the linkage moves, the geometric parameters also change. However, there are functions in the geometric parameters that do not change when the linkage moves, such as the normal distance and the angle between neighbour rotation or helical axes.

The configuration set K is the set of all parameters tk,sk,αk such that the closure equation

[formula]

is fulfilled. The symbol [formula] stands for projective equivalence, i.e., up to multiplication by a nonzero real scalar.

The mobility of K is the dimension of the solution set of Equation [\ref=eq:clos] as a complex analytic set in the parameter space. If it is positive, then we say that L is mobile.

We are interested in mobile linkages, and mainly those with mobility 1. Finding such linkage for given types, and numbers, of joints is a main goal. This leads to analysing the solutions of Equation ([\ref=eq:clos]).

If all values for t-parameters are ∞   and all values for s- and α-parameters are 0, then all mk are equal to 1 and Equation ([\ref=eq:clos]) is fulfilled. This point of K is called the initial configuration of L.

The dimension of K as a real analytic set would be a more interesting number than the mobility we defined above, but it is harder to control. For instance, planar 4R-linkages always have mobility 1, but the real dimension can also be 0. In any case, the complex dimension is an upper bound for the real dimension, and if the two numbers are not equal then all real configurations must be singularities of the complex configuration space.

The remaining part of this section is concerned with the theory of bonds. If the reader is willing to believe Theorem [\ref=thm:p], he/she may jump forward to this theorem, skip its proof and proceed with Section [\ref=construction-helical], in order to get faster to the application of Ax's theorem.

Bonds

For linkages with R-joints, bonds have been introduced in [\cite=hss2] as an algebraic tool which is used to describe and understand the algebraic structure of the configuration set. Informally speaking, bonds are the points in the boundary of the compactification of the complex configuration set. The closure equation degenerates in the boundary, and one obtains useful algebraic consequences. At this moment, we do not have any geometric intuition for bonds, we just use them mainly as a tool for studying the (real) configuration set and for deriving geometric conditions of the rotation axes. Here is the precise definition.

Let L be an n-linkage with joints of type R or P. Suppose Z is the projective closure of the complexification of KL in [formula]. Then the bond set B is defined as the intersection of Z and the solution set of the bond equation

[formula]

In [\cite=hss2], where the theory of bonds is initially developed, only linkages with mobility 1 are considered and bonds are defined as points on the normalisation of the curve K. In this paper, however, this is not necessary because we do not need multiplicities of bonds. Hence we can afford to simply say a bond is a point of B.

[formula]

(this definition is slightly different from the definition in [\cite=hss2], but the more complicated definition using multiplicities is not needed here).

Suppose G = (V,E) is the graph of a linkage, where vertices, elements of V, represent the rigid bodies of L and vi,vi∈V are connected via an edge e∈E is there is a joint between them. The bond diagram is then defined to be this graph together with the following extra information: two edges are connected if their corresponding joints are connected via a bond.

There is a unique family of 4R linkages such that the four axes are not all parallel and do not all have a common point, the Bennett linkage (see [\cite=bennett]). Its configuration curve can be defined by the equations

[formula]

where [formula], (a,b)  ≠  (1,0), a  ≠  0 are parameters. The bond set is

[formula]

and the bond diagram is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:bonds].

We define the offset o(h1,h2,h3) of three lines h1,h2,h3 as follows. We assume that neither h1||h2 nor h2||h3, where the symbol || is used to show the two lines are parallel (otherwise, the offset is not defined). Let n12 be the common normal of h1,h2, i.e., the unique line intersecting both h1 and h2 at a right angle. Let n23 be the common normal of h2,h3. Then o(h1,h2,h3) is defined as the signed distance between the intersection of h2,n12 and the intersection of h2,n23. The sign comes from the orientation of the line h2 represented as a dual quaternion. The offset of three consecutive R-joints is fixed when the linkage moves.

Assume that the lines h1,h2,h3 are coplanar and pairwise not parallel. Then o(h1,h2,h3) is the distance of the intersection points [formula] and [formula]. If h3 is rotated around h2 by an angle different from π, call the result h3', then h1,h2,h3' will not be coplanar, but we still have o(h1,h2,h3) = o(h1,h2,h3').

We recall some well-known facts on the bond diagram, and refer to [\cite=hss2] for details.

Every bond is attached to at least two joints.

If a bond is attached to a joint jk, then it connects jk to at least one other joint.

If a joint jk actually moves during the motion, then it is attached to at least one bond.

Two consecutive R-joints, ji and ji + 1, are not connected by a bond.

If ji,ji + 1 and ji + 2 are R-joints with axes hi,hi + 1 and hi + 2 such that ji is connected to ji + 2 and h1||h2, then h2||h3.

If ji,ji + 1 and ji + 2 are R-joints with axes hi,hi + 1 and hi + 2 such that hi is not parallel to hi + 1, and ji is connected to ji + 2, then o(hi,hi + 1,hi + 2) = 0.

5-linkages with Revolute and Prismatic Joints

In this section we classify mobile closed 5-linkages with R- and P-joints. For the case of R-joints only, this is well-known, as described below. The general case is handled by bond theory; this makes the proof quite conceptual and avoids long and technical calculations. We use the results of this section to classify 5-linkages with helical joints in Section [\ref=classification-helical].

If L has two neighbouring R-joints with equal axes or two neighbouring P-joints with equal directions, then we say that L is degenerate. Throughout this section, we assume that n = 5 or n = 4, and [formula] is a mobile linkage with configuration set K. We also assume that L is not degenerate, and that no joint parameters are constant during motion of the linkage (otherwise one could easily make n smaller).

If L has only R-joints, then we have one of the following three cases ([\cite=Karger]; see [\cite=hss2] for a proof using bond theory).

L is spherical, i.e., all rotation axes meet in the same point; then L has mobility 2.

L is planar, i.e., all rotation axes are parallel; then L has mobility 2.

L is a Goldberg linkage, constructed as follows: take two spatial 4-linkages with one joint and one link in common; then remove the common link. The mobility of the Goldberg linkage is 1. If [formula] are the rotation axes, then

[formula]

up to cyclic permutation of joints.

By considering the specified data and parametrized motions modulo ε, we may construct a spherical linkage L', the spherical projection of L. The P-joints of L disappear, their translation motions are projected to the identity. Parallel joint axes of L are projected to identical axes of L'. Note that K is projected to an algebraic subset of K' (the configuration set of L'). This subset has positive dimension if and only if L has at least one R-joint.

If L has 2 or more P-joints, then all rotation axes are parallel.

Let r  ≥  2 be the number of P-joints. Then L' is a spherical linkage with 5 - r  ≤  3 joints. Such a linkage is necessarily degenerate: if all three (or fewer) joints are actually moving, then all axes are identical.

In order to classify PRRRR linkages, we use bond theory. Here are some additional facts for bonds in the presence of P-joints.

Assume that ji is a P-joint, and ji + 1 and ji + 2 are R-joints.

The joints ji and ji + 1 cannot be connected by a bond.

If the joints ji and ji + 2 are connected by a bond, then the axes hi + 1 and hi + 2 are parallel.

(a) Assume, without loss of generality, that (  ∞  ,t) are the coordinates at (ji,ji + 1) of the bond connecting ji and ji + 1. Then we have that εpi(t - hi + 1) = 0, which is impossible.

(b) If (  ∞  ,t,t') are the coordinates at (ji,ji + 1,ji + 2) of the bond connecting ji and ji + 1, then εpi(t - hi + 1)(t' - hi + 2) = 0. We pass to the dual part. Since pi is invertible, we conclude that (t - pi + 1)(t' - pi + 2) = 0. This is only possible if t2 + 1 = t'2 + 1 = 0 and pi + 1  =    ±  pi + 2.

If j1 is a P-joint and all other joints are R-joints, then h2||h3 and h4||h5.

Assume that j1 is the P-joint. It must be connected by a bond to at least one other joint. By Lemma [\ref=lem:1], this cannot be j2 and j5, so we may assume it is connected to j3. By Lemma [\ref=lem:1] again, h2 and h3 are parallel. Then the spherical projection L' is a 4-linkage with 2 equal axes p2 and p3. Hence L' is degenerate, and the other two axes p4 and p5 are equal too.

Note that Lemma [\ref=lem:p1] holds for all ji with appropriate indices.

Let L be a 5-linkage with at least one P-joint and all other joints of type R. Then the following two cases are possible.

Up to cyclic shift, j1 is the only P-joint, h2||h3, and h4||h5; L has mobility 1, and t2  =    ±  t3 and t4  =    ±  t5 is fulfilled on the configuration curve.

All axes of R-joints are parallel.

Using Lemma [\ref=lem:p1], we get h2||h3, h4||h5. Without loss of generality, we assume p2 = p3 and p4 = p5; if this is not true, it can be easily achieved by replacing h3 by - h3 or h5 by - h5. Either all axes of R-joints are parallel or the axes of h3 and h4 are not parallel. In the second case, there is nothing left to show; let us assume that h3 and h4 are not parallel. The primal part of the closure equation is equivalent to the equality of the two rotations

[formula]

Since the axes are distinct, both rotations must be the identity, which implies t2 =  - t3 and t4 =  - t5.

Construction of Linkages with Helical Joints

In this section we give a construction that produces mobile linkages with H-joints from linkages with C-, P-, and R-joints. We illustrate the construction by several well-known examples and one example which is new.

We start with a simple construction: take a linkage with r C-joints that has mobility at least r + 1. For each C-joint jk, impose the additional restriction [formula] on its joint parameters (sk,tk), where gk is a nonzero real constant. Any additional equation reduces the mobility at most by 1, so we get a mobile linkage where every C-joint jk is replaced by an H-joint with pitch gk.

We can extend this simple construction using the observation that [formula]-linear relations between the angles imply algebraic relations between their tangents. For the general construction, which we call screw carving, we need the following ingredients.

a linkage L with m C-joints [formula] and an undetermined number of R- and P-joints;

an irreducible analytic subspace K0 of the configuration space of L;

an integer matrix A with m columns that annihilates the vector of analytic functions [formula] such that [formula];

an m-tuple [formula] of nonzero real numbers, so that A also annihilates the vector of functions [formula], where [formula] is the function [formula].

As before, the linkage L' with H-joints instead of C-joints is obtained by imposing the additional restriction [formula] on its joint parameters (sk,tk), for each C-joint tk. To obtain linkages with large mobility, the integer matrix A should have the largest possible rank, which means that all integral relations between the analytic angle functions are linear combination of matrix rows. (In the next section, we will indeed always choose such matrices of maximal rank.) The empty matrix with zero rows is allowed, then we just get the simple construction above.

Let d: =  dim (K0) and [formula]. Then the mobility of the linkage produced by screw carving is at least [formula].

The subset K' of K0 that satisfies the additional restrictions [formula] is contained in the configuration space of L'. Since the codimension of an analytic subset is never bigger than the number of defining equations, we see that dim (K')  ≥  d - m. We claim that K' can be defined (as a subset of K') by only [formula] equations.

Let [formula] be as above. The [formula]-vector space generated by these m functions has dimension at most [formula]. Without loss of generality, we assume that [formula] is a generating set. Any other αk can be expressed as a [formula]-linear combination

[formula]

with rational coefficients depending on the matrix A. But then we also have

[formula]

It follows that the equations [formula] imply all other equations.

Let L be a 4-linkage with 4 cylindrical joints with parallel axes. Its mobility is 4. For all configurations [formula], we have α1  +  α2  +  α3  +  α4 = 0 and s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 = 0. So we take K0 as the full configuration set, A as the 1  ×  4 matrix (1,1,1,1), and g1 = g2 = g3 = g4, and apply screw carving. We obtain a 4-linkage with 4 helical joints and mobility 4-4+1=1.

Similarly, one can obtain an n-linkage with n H-joints with parallel axes with mobility n - 3, n  ≥  4.

Here is a variation of the previous example. Set

[formula]

and let L be the CCRRR linkage with C-joint axes h1,h2 and R-joint axes h3,h4,h5. Its mobility is 3, and all configurations satisfy s1 + s2 = 0. We define K0 as the subvariety defined by tan (17 arccot (t1) - 11 arccot (t2)) = 0 (this is a rational function in t1,t2). Its dimension is 2. We set as the 1  ×  2 matrix A = (1,1) and [formula], [formula]. By screw carving we get an HHRRR linkage with mobility 1. Figure [\ref=fig:hhrrr] shows the trace of the joint j4 when the link with the two H-joints j1,j2 is fixed.

Let h1,h2,h3 be lines. Reflecting them by the coordinate axes represented by [formula], we get [formula], [formula], [formula]. Let L be the 6C-linkage with axes [formula]. The zero set of the closure equation

[formula]

has a component of dimension 4, given by the equations

[formula]

[formula]

With [formula] and g1 = g4, g2 = g5, g3 = g6, the screw carving procedure gives a line symmetric 6H linkage with mobility 1.

Similarly, one can construct a plane symmetric RHHRHH linkage with mobility 1. Both linkages are well-known, see [\cite=Baker:97].

Let h1, h2, h3 be lines with linear independent primal parts that do not intersect pairwise, such that o(h1,h2,h3) = o(h3,h1,h2) = 0. Let L be the RRCRRC linkage with axes h1,h2,h3,h2,h1,h3. The zero set of the closure equation

[formula]

has two components of dimension 2. The first is given by t1 =  - t5, t2 =  - t4, t3 = t6  =    ∞  , s3 = s6 = 0; this is a degenerate motion which does not separate the pairs of axes at joints (j1,j5) and at (j2,j4). The equations of the second component K0 can be computed by computer algebra. Two of them are s3 = s6 and t3 = t6; the remaining are more complicated. With [formula] and g3 = g6, the screw carving procedure gives an RRHRRH linkage with mobility 1. In contrast to all families of mobile 6-linkages with H-joints that have been known up to now, this linkage has no parallel axes or apparent geometric symmetries. A distinctive property is the existence of a starting position with three pairs of coinciding axes.

Classification of 5-linkages with Helical Joints

Now we show that the construction in Section [\ref=construction-helical] is complete, i.e., every linkage with helical joints can be obtained in this way. The main idea is the application of a theorem by Ax to separate the transcendental part and the algebraic part of the closure equation. Then, we use the completeness result to classify 5-linkages with P-, R-, and H-linkages.

Let L be a mobile linkage with m helical joints; we assume that it is not degenerate, and that all joints actually move. There is a natural candidate for ingredients of the screw carving constructions in order to produce L.

We define the cylindrical extension L' of L be replacing all H-joints by C-joints. The configuration set K of L can be naturally embedded in the configuration K' set of L'.

We take K0 as the Zariski closure of K in K', i.e., the subset of K' defined by all algebraic equations that hold for K.

We take A as an integer matrix whose rows generate, as a [formula]-module, the coefficient vectors of all integral linear equations that hold for the m α-parameters in K.

The m nonzero numbers are defined as the m pitches of K.

Application of the screw carving constructions just re-installs the screw conditions that already existed in L. But our construction includes a prediction on the mobility, and it is not clear if the mobility of L' is big enough to explain the mobility of L.

Since the use of number theoretic theorems is not usual in kinematics, we include the full statement of the Theorem of Ax on the transcendence degrees of a function field with exponential functions.

Let q,n be positive integers. Let [formula] be analytic functions in some neighbourhood of [formula] about the origin o for which [formula] are [formula]-linearly independent. Let r be the rank of the Jacobi-matrix [formula]. Then the transcendence degree of [formula] is greater than or equal to q + r.

This is [\cite=ax], Corollary 2.

Let L be a linkage with m helical joints. Let K be an irreducible component of its configuration space containing the initial configuration as a nonsingular point. Let K0 be the Zariski closure of K in the cylindrical extension of L. Let A be the integral matrix defined by the [formula]-relations between the helical joint parameters. Then

[formula]

Consequently, L can be obtained by screw carving from its cylindrical extension.

By Lemma [\ref=lem:carving], we have [formula], so it suffices to show the other inequality. Let d: =  dim (K), and [formula]. Let [formula] be the projection to the helical joint parameters [formula], and let [formula] be its image. Similarly, we define [formula] as the projection to the cylindrical joint parameters of L' and KC as the image. There is a natural embedding [formula], the map πH is the restriction of πC along this embedding, and KC is the Zariski closure of KH in [formula].

Let dH: =  dim (KH). Then there is an analytic isomorphism φ of a neighbourhood [formula] of the origin o mapping o to the initial configuration. For [formula], let [formula] be the projection to the joint parameter αk. They generate a q-dimensional [formula]-vector space. We may assume that [formula] generate this vector space. The rank of the Jacobian of [formula] is equal to the rank of the Jacobian of all coordinate functions, which is equal to dH. By Theorem [\ref=thm:axorig], the field [formula] has transcendence degree at least dH + q over [formula]. This field is [formula]-isomorphic to the function field of KC, by the isomorphism

[formula]

Therefore dim (KC)  ≥  dH + q.

Let E  ⊂  KC be the set of all points x such that dim (π- 1C(x))  >   dim (K0) -  dim (KC). Since dimension is upper semicontinuous in the Zariski topology, E is a proper algebraic subvariety of KC. Since KH is Zariski dense in KC, it is not contained in E. Therefore the generic fibre of πH:K  →  KH has dimension dim (K0) -  dim (KC). Hence we have

[formula]

From the cylindrical extension Lc, we may construct families Fp and Fr of linkages by setting either the rotation parameters or the translation parameters of the joints [formula] to fixed values [formula] respectively [formula], where [formula] generate the [formula]-vector space of all angle parameter functions at the helical joints. This imposes exactly q additional equations to the configuration set K0, hence the mobility of any linkage in one of the two families is greater than or equal to the mobility of L. In family Fr, every C-joint is replaced by an R-joint, and in family Fp, every C-joint is replaced by a P-joint.

We choose generic members for both families and call them Lp and Lr. The angles and orthogonal distances of neighbouring R-joints is constant for both families, and is equal to the value of the corresponding parameter of L. The offsets do change, but in a transparent way: if j2 is an H-joint and j1,j3 are H- or R-joints in L, then the offset of the axes at the corresponding axes in the family Fr is a linear non-constant function in the family parameter σ2. Similarly, the angle between the directions of j1 and j3 from j2 in spherical geometry change with the family parameter τ2. In particular, the generic family member Lr has nonzero offset and the generic family member Lp has nonzero angles at this place.

Linkages with helical joints are called degenerate if there are neighbouring R- or H-joints with equal axes, neighbouring P-joints with equal directions, or an H-joint with a neighbouring P-joint in the direction of the axis of the H-joint. In all these cases it is easily possible to simplify the pair of neighboring joints from RR to R, HH to H or C, HR to C, PP to P, or HP to C. Assume that L is nondegenerate. Because the axes/directions of Lr and Lp are equal to the axes/directions of an instance of Lc after application of a motion in K0, Lr is also nondegenerate, and Lp can only be degenerate if L has neighbouring H-joints with parallel axes. However, it may happen that some joints of Lr or Lp remain fixed during the motion, even if this is not the case for L.

The existence of mobile linkages with only P- and R-joints with particular properties as a consequence of the existence of mobile linkages with H-joints allows to classify the 5-linkages with H-joints. We do that by constructing the linkages Lr and Lp and then compare with the classifications in Section [\ref=non-helical] and Theorem [\ref=thm:p]. We also need the classification of 4-linkages, because it may be that some joints of Lr or Lp are fixed. For convenience, we write here the facts on 4-and 5-linkages that are used below. For the first 4 facts, we assume that L is a nondegenerate mobile linkage with R- and P-joints, such that every joint actually moves. Let n be the number of joints of L.

If n = 4 and L has a P-joint, then all axes of R-joints are parallel (this is a special case of Delassus' theorem [\cite=Delassus]).

If n = 4 and L has no P-joints, then either all axes are parallel, or no neighbouring pair of axes is parallel and all offsets are zero (see [\cite=bhs]).

If n = 5 and L has a P-joint, then either all axes of R-joints are parallel, or j1 is a P-joint, all other joints are of type R, and h2||h3 and h4||h5 (Theorem [\ref=thm:p]).

If n = 5 and L has no P-joints, then either all axes are parallel, or no neighbouring pair of axes is parallel and at least three of the five offsets are zero (see Section [\ref=sec:bonds]).

Any movable CRP linkage is degenerate, i.e., either the axis of the C-joint and the axis of the R-joint coincide, or the axis of the C-joint is parallel to the direction of the P-joint. Here we leave the proof to the reader.

Here is the classification of 5-linkages with joints of type R, P, or C, based on Theorem [\ref=thm:ax] (compare also with Delassus's classification [\cite=Delassus] of 4-linkages with these three types of joints).

Let L be a non-degenerate mobile 5-linkage with R-, P-, and H-joints, with at least one H-joint, such that all joints actually move. Up to cyclic permutation, the following cases are possible.

All axes of R- and H-joints are parallel.

There is one P-joint j1, all other joints are of type H or R, h2||h3 and h4||h5.

Let r be the number of neighbouring blocks of equal axes of the spherical projection Ls. The proof proceeds by case distinction on r. The cases r = 4 and r = 5 are split into two subcases.

Then Lr is either a 5R-linkage or a 4R-linkage with an extra immobile R-joint.

Here is an example that shows that the second case is indeed possible.

Let h2,h3 be parallel lines with a distance a to each other. Let h4,h5 be another pair of parallel lines, not parallel to the first pair, also with distance a to each other. We assume that p2 =  - p3 and p4 =  - p5. Let [formula]. For any [formula], the composed motion

[formula]

is a translation, where the translation vector lies on a circle in a plane orthogonal to p2 with radius a. Similarly, for [formula] the composed motion m4m5 is a translation with translation vector on another circle with the same radius. We can choose a parametrisation such that the motion m2m3m4m5 is a translation in a fixed direction (p2 + p4 or p2 - p4). Hence the linkage with P-joint in this direction and H-joints with axes h2,h3,h4,h5 and pitches g2,g2,g4,g4 is mobile.

Conclusion

Using Ax's theorem and screw carving, it is possible to investigate mobility questions for arbitrary linkages with helical joints. The classification of mobile closed 5-linkages with joints of type R, P, or H, given in this paper, is just a first application of this reduction.

A challenge for future research is the classification of mobile closed 6-linkages with helical joints. In contrast to the case of 5-linkages, reduction to linkages with joints of type R or P will not be enough, because our knowledge of that linkages is still quite incomplete: even the classification of mobile closed 6R linkages is an open problem. But there is a reason to believe that classifying 6-linkages with at least one H-joint is substantially easier than the 6R case: the linkages constructed by cylindrical extension and fixing either the rotational or the translational parameter have properties that could help the classification (for instance, generic offsets). Another possible attempt would be to extend the theory of bonds to linkages with C-joints and to configuration sets where a fixed set of angle functions satisfy [formula]-linear equations.
