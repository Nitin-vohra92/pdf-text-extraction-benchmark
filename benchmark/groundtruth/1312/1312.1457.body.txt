Random Backward Iteration Algorithm for Julia sets of Rational Semigroups

Introduction

The work of Boyd [\cite=Boyd2], later generalized by Sumi [\cite=Su3], provides a formal justification for a method we call the "full backward iteration algorithm" for generating graphical computer approximations of Julia sets of finitely generated rational semigroups where each map is of degree two or more. This method has been used by the present authors and many others to generate such fractal images. However, it was also noted that the "random backward iteration algorithm" (also known as the "ergodic method" or "chaos game" method) seemed to always provide the same pictures, though formal proof had not yet been given, except in specialized examples (see [\cite=Fujishima]). The goal of this paper is to provide a formal proof of the strict mathematical sense in which the random backward iteration algorithm works. Analogous results, for both the "full" and "random" methods, in the context of attractor sets for contracting iterated function systems (see [\cite=Hutchinson] [\cite=BEH] [\cite=Elton] [\cite=RSThesis]) and Julia sets of a iterated single rational functions (see [\cite=HawkinsTaylor] [\cite=Lyu] [\cite=Mane] [\cite=FLM]) are known. In these mentioned works the benefits of the random (backward) iteration method over the full (backward) iteration method in terms of simplicity, speed, and memory are described and so we will not repeat these same benefits here. Both the full and random methods for both attractor sets of iterated function systems and Julia sets of rational semigroups are implemented using the freely available application Julia 2.0 [\cite=Julia2.0].

The Julia set (defined below) is the set of points where there is chaos or instability in the dynamics, and as such is of great interest in many settings. As described in [\cite=SumiRandom] [\cite=SumiCooperation] the setting of rational semigroups is of real importance in the study of, say, population dynamics of a species which, unlike the iteration case, has multiple choices of survival strategies to employ from year to year. Methods for drawing Julia sets for the more general setting of rational semigroups are more limited than those available for iteration. For example, the iteration methods which are based on the presence of an attracting fixed point (e.g., using an "escape to infinity criterion" for polynomials z2 + c) require the complete invariance of the Julia and Fatou sets and are thus not adaptable to semigroups where these sets only have partial invariance. It is, however, interesting to note that in the context of polynomial semigroup dynamics, studying the probability P(z) that a random forward obit starting at z "escapes" to infinity can produce quite beautiful pictures and intriguing mathematics (see [\cite=SumiRandom] [\cite=SumiCooperation]). In fact, the function P(z) is often a continuous function on all of [formula], but is almost everywhere flat, varying only on the thin fractal Julia set of the related semigroup. Hence, extending to the semigroup setting the backward iteration method is important as it adds to the number of reliable ways one can now computer graphically illustrate this important locus of instability, i.e., the Julia set.

We now introduce the basic terminology and notions needed to describe the full and random methods mentioned above.

Let [formula] be a rational semigroup generated by non-constant rational maps fj where the semigroup operation is composition of functions, i.e., G is the collections of all maps which can be expressed as a finite composition of maps from the generating set [formula].

Research on the dynamics of rational semigroups was initiated by Hinkkanen and Martin in [\cite=HM1], where each rational semigroup was always taken to have at least one element of degree at least two. Though the semigroups G to which our main theorem apply will meet this criteria, we also have need to define the relevant notions of Fatou and Julia set for semigroups of Möbius maps. (For an in depth look at the dynamics of Möbius semigroups see [\cite=FMS].) Also, Ren, Gong, and Zhou studied rational semigroups from the perspective of random dynamical systems (see [\cite=ZR] [\cite=GR]).

We thus follow [\cite=HM1] in saying that for a rational semigroup G the Fatou set F(G) is the set of points in [formula] which have a neighborhood on which G is normal, and its complement in [formula] is called the Julia set J(G). The more classical Fatou set and Julia set of the cyclic semigroup 〈g〉 generated by a single map (i.e., the collection of iterates {gn:n  ≥  1}) is denoted by F(g) and J(g), respectively.

We quote the following results from [\cite=HM1]. The Fatou set F(G) is forward invariant under each element of G, i.e., g(F(G))  ⊆  F(G) for all g∈G, and thus J(G) is backward invariant under each element of G, i.e., g- 1(J(G))  ⊆  J(G) for all g∈G.

We should take a moment to note that the sets F(G) and J(G) are, however, not necessarily completely invariant under the elements of G. This is in contrast to the case of iteration dynamics, i.e., the dynamics of cyclic semigroups generated by a single function. For a treatment of alternatively defined completely invariant Julia sets of rational semigroups the reader is referred to [\cite=RSThesis] [\cite=RS1] [\cite=RS2] [\cite=SSS].

For the rest of this paper we assume that the rational semigroup [formula] satisfies the following conditions:

The semigroup G contains at least one element of degree two or more.

The exceptional set E(G), set of points z with a finite backward orbit [formula], is contained in F(G). Note that [\cite=HM1] shows (E(G))  ≤  2.

The Möbius semigroup H = {h- 1:h∈G} satisfies F(H)  ⊇  J(G) (setting [formula] when [formula]).

Note that [\cite=Boyd2] requires the stronger assumption that [formula] contain no Möbius maps, from which all three of the above assumptions follow. These relaxed assumptions on G are used in [\cite=Su3] to show the following, whose proof we include here for completeness.

Letting G be as in Remark [\ref=AssumptionsG] and given any [formula], there exists a compact set [formula] that is backward invariant under G and that contains a.

If [formula], then [formula] will suffice. Now suppose (E(G)) = 2. Since E(G) is a finite backward invariant set under G, it is also forward invariant under G. Since (J(G))  ≥  3 (which follows since J(f)  ⊆  J(G) for all f∈G and some f has degree two or more), each component of F(G) supports a hyperbolic metric. Let D be the union of two disjoint hyperbolic disks of radius δ each centered at a point in E(G). Since F(G) is forward invariant under G, Pick's Theorem implies that no g∈G can expand the hyperbolic distance. Hence D must be forward invariant under G. Hence, [formula] is backward invariant. Choosing δ small enough then ensures that a∈K. The remaining case (E(G)) = 1 is handled similarly.

Note that because J(G) is the smallest closed backward invariant set containing three or more points (see [\cite=HM1]), we must have J(G)  ⊆  K.

Full backward iteration algorithm

Call [formula], where each dj  =   deg fj.

Notation: For each [formula] and [formula], the equation fj(w) = z has dj solutions (counted according to multiplicity). Giving these solutions an arbitrary (but fixed) order [formula], and doing so for all [formula] and all [formula], allows us to define a collection of d right inverses of the maps fj, i.e., dj right inverses for each fj. Specifically, we choose [formula] and [formula], , [formula].

Because the order of the zi,j is arbitrary, we cannot expect the maps gi to be true inverse branches of the fj. In fact, the order of the zi,j can be chosen to make each gi discontinuous at every point. Due to the stochastic methods in what follows, however, we do not require the gi to be more than the labels that they are under this construction. However, we do note that if z is a point which is not a critical value of any of the fj, then the gi may be chosen to be well defined local branches in a neighborhood of z and thus be analytic there.

Let [formula] be fixed and use Lemma [\ref=LemmaK] to choose a compact set [formula] that is backward invariant under G and that contains a. We often choose to write [formula]. Note that [formula] depends on the initial choice of a though we suppress this dependence in our notation.

Given a probability vector [formula], i.e., each bj > 0 and [formula], we let πb be the probability measure on [formula] given by [formula] whenever [formula], where we set d0 = 0. We let [formula] be the probability vector such that each [formula] noting that this gives the uniform measure [formula] for all [formula].

For [formula], let νa,bj be the measure on [formula] of total mass bj given by

[formula]

where δz denotes the unit point mass measure at z.

We now define probability measures μa,bn on [formula] as follows:

[formula]

and, in general, for n > 1

[formula]

Note that since K is backward invariant under G, the support of each μa,bn is in K.

Following [\cite=Boyd2] and [\cite=Su3], we define, for each [formula], a bounded linear operator Tj = Tbj on the space [formula] of continuous functions (endowed with the sup norm [formula]) on [formula] by

[formula]

Hence, each operator Tj is bj times the average of the values of φ evaluated at the dj preimages of z under fj (and so [formula]). Note that although each gi may fail to be continuous, since the set of solutions of fj(w) = z vary continuously in z, the map Tjφ is continuous.

Now define the bounded linear operator [formula] which gives

[formula]

and has [formula]. Hence, (Tφ)(z) is a weighted average of φ evaluated at all d preimages of z under all generators fj. Note also that all preimages under the same fj carry the same weight (namely [formula]) as determined by the carefully constructed πb.

The continuity of (Tφ)(z) (which is crucial for our purposes) depends critically on the preimages under the same fj carrying the same weight (though, as we have allowed above, the preimages under different fj may have different weights). As an example, consider the following situation for G = 〈z2〉. Here d = 2 (and b = (1) is trivial) and suppose π(1) = 0.9 and π(2) = 0.1 are unequal weights given to the preimages under the map z2. As we may do, choose [formula] and [formula] for all z  ≠  1, but set g1(1) = 1 and g2(1) =  - 1. The measure μz1 is then given as μz1  =  0.9δg1(z)  +  0.1δg2(z) for all z. However, for [formula], we have [formula] as z  →  1 with z  ≠  1. However, [formula], which, for a proper choice of φ shows (Tφ)(z) to fail to be continuous. From this example we can clearly see that anywhere that g1 fails to be continuous poses a similar problem and thus this problem (of trying to have unequal weights for preimages under the same map) is robust since, as a branch of the inverse of z2, g1 must be discontinuous somewhere.

Letting [formula] denote the space of probability Borel measures on [formula], and noting that it is a compact metric space in the topology of weak* convergence, we have that the adjoint [formula] is given by

[formula]

for all Borel sets [formula]. Using the operator notation [formula] we express the action of the adjoint as 〈Tφ,ρ〉  =  〈φ,T*ρ〉. Note that the map [formula] given by z  ↦  μz,b1 is continuous since for a sequence zn  →  z0 in [formula], we have 〈φ,μzn,b1〉  =  (Tφ)(zn)  →  (Tφ)(z0) = 〈φ,μz0,b1〉 for any [formula], i.e., μzn,b1  →  μz,b1.

The work of Lyubich [\cite=Lyu] and Friere, Lopes, and Mañé [\cite=FLM] [\cite=Mane] on the existence of an invariant measure on the Julia set of a single rational function was generalized to semigroups by the work of Boyd (for b = b' with each dj  ≥  2) and Sumi (for general b). The result is the following theorem.

Let G be as in Remark [\ref=AssumptionsG] and let [formula] be a probability vector. Then the measures μa,bn converge weakly to a regular Borel probability measure μb  =  μbG independently of and locally uniformly in [formula]. Further, the closed support of μb is J(G) and T*μb  =  μb.

Theorem [\ref=FullMethod] provides the justification for the "full backward iteration algorithm" used to graphically approximate J(G). This method simply plots the dn (not necessarily distinct) points in the support of μa,bn. We note that this iterative process plots all d inverses of each of the dn - 1 points in the support of μa,bn - 1 to generate the support of μa,bn. Also, note that the support of μa,bn is independent of b (but not of a), which merely adjusts the weights on the point masses.

Using Theorem [\ref=FullMethod], the same argument given in Lemma 2.6 of [\cite=HawkinsTaylor] shows the following.

Let G be as in Remark [\ref=AssumptionsG] and let [formula] be a probability vector. Then the measure μb is the unique probability measure on [formula] that has support disjoint from the set of exceptional points and that is invariant under T*.

Random backward iteration algorithm

Let [formula] denote the space of one-sided sequences on d symbols, regarded with the usual topology and σ-algebra of Borel sets. Now let [formula] be the Bernoulli measure on Σ+d which is then given on basis elements as follows: for fixed jn for [formula], we have [formula].

Let us define a random walk as follows. Starting at a point [formula], we note that there are d preimages (counting according to multiplicity) of a under the generators of the semigroup G. We randomly select z1 to be one of these preimages by a two step process, selecting a map fj with probability bj and then selecting one preimage under that map fj with (necessarily uniform) probability [formula]. Note that this process is the same as randomly selecting i1 from [formula] with probability πb(i1) and setting z1 = gi1(z0). Likewise, z2 is randomly selected to be one of the d preimages of z1. Continue in this fashion to generate what we call a random backward orbit {zn} of z0 = a under the semigroup G.

Utilizing the notation introduced in Section [\ref=SectionFull], we see that Σ+d generates the entire set of backward orbits starting at z0 = a by letting the sequence [formula] generate the backward orbit [formula]. We note that the map [formula] might not be one-to-one since more than one sequence could generate the same backward orbit.

Formally, we define our random walk {zn} in terms of random variables {Zn} given as follows. For each [formula], we let [formula] by [formula] and [formula]. Hence, [formula]. Note that each Zn is measurable, and, in fact, continuous, despite the arbitrariness involved in labeling the gi, since for any [formula], the set [formula] is a union of cylinders of the form [formula]. This is immediate since the value of Zn depends only on the first n coordinates of [formula].

Let G be as in Remark [\ref=AssumptionsG], let [formula], and let [formula] be a probability vector. Then the stochastic process [formula] forms a Markov process with transition probabilities {μz,b1}, i.e., for each Borel set [formula] we have [formula].

Let D be in D, the sigma algebra generated by [formula], and let [formula] be Borel. We will show that the conditional probability [formula] by verifying that

[formula]

where [formula] is D-measurable.

To demonstrate measurability, consider any set [formula] and note that [formula]. Since Zn(Σ+d) is a finite set, we see that [formula] is finite and hence Borel. Thus, {Zn∈A}∈D. This allows one to quickly show that each function 1B(giZn) is D-measurable, and hence so is [formula].

For each [formula], let [formula] and let [formula]. Note that {in + 1 = i} and Di∈D are independent. From this it follows that, for [formula],

[formula]

With this and the fact that the Ci's are disjoint with [formula], we calculate

[formula]

The main result can now be stated in terms of the probability measures, defined for each [formula] and [formula], by

[formula]

Let G be as in Remark [\ref=AssumptionsG], let [formula], and let [formula] be a probability vector. Then, for Pb a.a. [formula], the probability measures [formula] converge weakly to μb in [formula].

Theorem [\ref=main] provides the justification for the "random backward iteration algorithm" used to graphically approximate J(G). This method simply plots, for large n, the n points in the support of [formula], i.e., the points of a random backward orbit, where [formula] is randomly selected according to Pb. If a∉J(G), then it is often appropriate to not plot the first hundred or so points in the random backward orbit since the earlier points in the orbit might not be very close to J(G).

The application Julia 2.0 [\cite=Julia2.0] operates when the probability vector b is uniform, i.e., each [formula]. Thus, Theorem [\ref=main] provides the mathematical justification for its use (when the "ergodic/random" setting is used).

We note that due to the discontinuous nature of the gi, we may have a very strong dependence on the choice of a regarding the convergence of [formula] to μb. In particular, if [formula] for a particular sequence [formula], it may very well be that for a slightly perturbed value a' we have that [formula] converges to a measure other than μb or does not converge at all. For example, consider G = 〈z2〉. Thus g1 and g2 will, at each z take on the values [formula] and [formula], and can do so arbitrarily. So, supposing that a particular choice [formula] has [formula] for a = 1 will in no way guarantee the convergence of [formula] to μb for a' = 1.1. This is because the choices of each gij (either [formula] or [formula]) for a' can be made completely independently of the choices for a since the corresponding random backward orbits will be completely disjoint from each other. In particular, the choices for each gi along the backward orbit of a' could always be [formula], in which case we clearly see that [formula].

Our setup in this paper allows for gi that are nowhere continuous, and it is this which causes the problem. However, this is a robust problem since there is no way to choose gi in any fashion where they will be everywhere continuous (since some gi must be right inverses of a degree two or more map) and so we can never expect that backward orbits of nearby points will always be similar, even when chosen according to the same [formula]. This is in stark contrast to the contracting iterated function system case where the strong contraction leads to all orbits along the same [formula] behaving in the same way, i.e., converging closer to each other in the sense that for any a and a' we have [formula] as n  →    ∞   [\cite=Elton] [\cite=RSThesis].

Let Σa,b  ⊂  Σ+d be the set of [formula] such that [formula], and note that μb1  ≠  μb2 implies [formula]. Hence we see from Theorem [\ref=main] that Pb1 and Pb2 are mutually singular when μb1  ≠  μb2. If it were the case that b1  ≠  b2 implies μb1  ≠  μb2 (which we suspect is generally true for most semigroups and is certainly true for the analogous situation of the iterated function system which generates the Sierpinski triangle), then we would have another proof of the fact that Pb1 and Pb2 are mutually singular when b1  ≠  b2. This fact, however, is already known to be true by the following argument. Since the shift map on Σ+d is always ergodic with respect to either measure Pb1 or Pb2 (see [\cite=Walters], p.33), Pb1 and Pb2 must be singular by Theorem 6.10(iv) of [\cite=Walters].

Consequences of the main result Theorem [\ref=main]

It is well known (see [\cite=HM1]) that the characterization of J(G) as the smallest closed backward invariant set containing three or more points implies that for any point [formula], we have

[formula]

Furthermore, if [formula], then

[formula]

Using Theorem [\ref=main] together with the fact that the support of μb is J(G) no matter what probability vector b is chosen, one can quickly show the following strengthening of these results. Nearly identical details of the argument can be found in [\cite=HawkinsTaylor] and so we omit them here.

Let G be as in Remark [\ref=AssumptionsG] and let [formula]. Let [formula], where the union is taken over all probability vectors b. Then

[formula]

Furthermore, if a∈J(G), then

[formula]

Meeting the conclusion of this corollary is generally what one is looking for when saying that the "random backward iteration" method works in drawing (an approximation of) J(G). Note that this conclusion holds for Pb a.a. [formula], regardless of the choice of b.

Suppose [formula] is chosen so that [formula] converges to μb. Since the support of μb is J(G), it is clear that the points [formula] of the backward orbit cannot visit any compact neighborhood disjoint from J(G) too often, else this would imply that the μb measure of such a neighborhood is positive. In this sense, most of the points [formula] approach J(G). The following result, in fact, says more is true under certain circumstances.

Let G be as in Remark [\ref=AssumptionsG] and let [formula]. Let [formula], where the union is taken over all probability vectors b. Suppose J(G) has interior or [formula], where P(G) denotes the postcritical set [formula]. Then we have [formula], i.e., [formula] as j  →    ∞  .

The proof of the analogous result in [\cite=HawkinsTaylor] for single function iteration utilizes Sullivan's No Wandering Domains Theorem (see [\cite=Sullivan]) and does not require the above stated hypothesis on J(G). However, the more broad setting here of rational semigroups does not offer such a No Wandering Domains Theorem, in general. Thus our methods below offer a new approach, which we note is also applicable to the iteration result found in [\cite=HawkinsTaylor], in those cases where [formula]. Note that J(f) cannot have interior without [formula], which would make the conclusion of this result trivial.

Let [formula] be such that [formula].

First suppose that a z can be chosen from the interior of J(G) and note that, unlike in the iteration case, it is still possible for J(G) to not equal all of [formula] (see[\cite=HM1]). Letting D be a small spherical disk centered at z and contained in J(G), we see that μb(D) > 0. Since [formula], some [formula] (infinitely many actually) must visit D and hence lie in J(G). But since J(G) is backward invariant, each [formula] for j  ≥  j0 must also lie in J(G) and so the conclusion holds.

Now suppose [formula], but there exists some ε > 0 such that [formula] along the subsequence jn. Let η > 0 be chosen so that the spherical disk Δ(z,η) does not meet P(G). This implies that each g∈G has degree(g) well-defined analytic inverses on Δ(z,η). By Lemma 4.5 of [\cite=Su3], the family F of all these inverses for all g∈G is normal on some disk Δ(z,δ'). By equicontinuity of F, there exists δ > 0 such that diam(h(Δ(z,δ)) < ε / 2 for all h∈F. Since μb(Δ(z,δ)) > 0 and [formula], there exists some [formula] in Δ(z,δ). However, each [formula], for j > j0, must equal [formula] for some hj∈F (specifically hj must one of the branches of the inverse of [formula]). But then [formula]. Since by backward invariance hj(z)∈J(G), we have a contradiction to the assumption that [formula] along the subsequence jn.

Note that the maps hj∈F chosen in this proof were not written as [formula] since, as mentioned in Remark [\ref=Arbitrary], the gi might fail to even be continuous. However, given that z∉P(G), we could have chosen the gi to be such that every finite composition of the gi is analytic in the disk Δ(z,η).

There are many examples of G which satisfy (1)-(3) in Remark 1.1 such that J(G) has interior but where J(G) is not the Riemann sphere. For example, any finitely generated G consisting of polynomials of degree two or more whose Julia set contains a superattracting fixed point of some element g∈G is such an example. See [\cite=HMJ].

We note that Corollaries [\ref=Closure] and [\ref=RandomLimitSet] combine to show that for the indicated G, sequences [formula] generate a backward orbit whose ω-limit set is exactly J(G), and so we see that [formula] as n  →    ∞   where dH denotes the Hausdorff metric.

Furstenberg-Kifer Random walks and law of large numbers

In this section we introduce a key result of Furstenberg and Kifer to relate the invariance of the measure μb to the convergence of Cesaro averages of φ(zn) where {zn} is a random backward orbit and [formula]. As in [\cite=HawkinsTaylor], this result is the key tool in the proof of our main theorem.

Let M be a compact metric space and let P(M) be the space of Borel probability measures on M, noting that P(M) is a compact metric space in the topology of weak* convergence. Suppose there exists a continuous map M  →  P(M) assigning to each x∈M a measure μx. The corresponding Markov operator [formula] is given by

[formula]

Suppose the stochastic process [formula] is a Markov process corresponding to H, i.e., [formula].

Given these assumptions we then have the following, which is a weaker version (but sufficient for our purposes) of Theorem 1.4 in [\cite=FurstKifer].

Assume that there is a unique probability measure ν on M that is invariant under the adjoint operator H* on P(M) and let φ∈C(M). Then with probability one

[formula]

as N  →    ∞  .

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

By Lemma [\ref=LemmaK] we may choose a compact set [formula] that is backward invariant under G. Let [formula] and note that its restriction to K lies in C(K). Because K is backward invariant we may then apply Theorem [\ref=FKtheorem] using M = K, μx  =  μz,b1, H = T, ν  =  μb and Xn  =  Zn, noting that all the hypotheses have been met by Lemma [\ref=Unique] and Claim [\ref=Markov]. Thus we obtain a set Σφ  ⊆  Σ+d with Pb(Σφ) = 1 such that for all [formula] we have

[formula]

Since the set Σφ depends on φ, we require an extra step to achieve single such set to work for all maps in [formula]. Though it is perhaps standard, and was omitted in [\cite=HawkinsTaylor], we include it here for the sake of completeness.

Since [formula] is compact we know that [formula] is separable. Let {φj} be dense in [formula]. Let [formula] and note that Pb(Σ0) = 1. Let ψ∈C(K). Let ε > 0. Select φj such that [formula]. Then for all [formula], we have [formula] for large n.

Hence on Σ0 we get the convergence we seek, for all ψ∈C(K) and this completes the proof.
