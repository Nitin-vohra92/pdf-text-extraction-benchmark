On the DoF Region of the K-user MISO Broadcast Channel with Hybrid CSIT

Introduction

The degrees of freedom (DoF) region, defined as the pre-log factor of the capacity in the high SNR regime, of the broadcast channel (BC) has received considerable attention in the past few years. Under the idealized assumption of perfect CSIT , the capacity of the Gaussian multiple input multiple output (MIMO) BC was obtained in [\cite=Weingarten2006], which showed that the sum-DoF of a MIMO BC with M antennas at the transmitter and Ni antennas at the [formula] receiver is [formula]. Later, the DoF region of the MIMO BC with no CSIT was characterized for the 2-user MIMO BC with i.i.d. Rayleigh fading in [\cite=Huang2012] and for the K-user MIMO BC for a general class of fading distributions (that includes i.i.d. Rayleigh fading as well as the more general isotropic fading model) under which the transmit directions to different receive antennas are statistically indistinguishable in [\cite=Vaze2012], where it was established that the complete absence of any channel state information at the transmitter leads to a collapse of the DoF to that achievable through only time-sharing.

Investigations by Maddah-Ali and Tse in [\cite=Maddah-Ali2012], into the DoF region of the MISO BC under the assumption of delayed CSIT, showed that even delayed CSIT can lead to significant gains in DoF beyond that with no CSIT, through the exploitation of the side information available at the various receivers. While further extensions of this result to the MIMO BC have been made, notably in [\cite=Vaze2011] and [\cite=Abdoli2011], it has also sparked interest in other CSIT models, which combine both perfect CSIT and delayed CSIT in various ways. The mixed CSIT model was investigated in [\cite=Yang2012] [\cite=Gou2012] [\cite=Chen2012], where the transmitter has the same combination of delayed CSIT and an imperfect version of the instantaneous CSIT from each receiver, and the DoF region for the 2-user MISO BC was completely characterized under this model. The alternating CSIT model was introduced in [\cite=Tandon2012], where the CSIT state for each receiver is allowed to alternate between no CSIT, delayed CSIT and instantaneous CSIT states, and the DoF region of the 2-user MISO BC was characterized under this model in [\cite=Tandon2012].

The DoF region of the 2-user MIMO BC and the 2-user MIMO IC were respectively characterized in [\cite=Tandon2012a] and [\cite=Mohanty2012], under the hybrid CSIT model, where the CSIT about one receiver is delayed and the CSIT about the other receiver is instantaneous. In this paper, we prove an outer bound for the DoF region of the K-user MISO BC in its most general hybrid CSIT setting, with an arbitrary number of receivers in the instantaneous CSIT state and the rest of the receivers in the delayed CSIT state, and then apply this outer bound to the 3-user MISO BC, where the transmitter has instantaneous CSIT about one receiver and delayed CSIT about the other two. Although we are unable to prove that this outer bound is tight, we provide two communication schemes for the 3-user MISO BC which achieve a DoF tuple of [formula] for a total sum-DoF of [formula], which exceeds the sum-DoF of [formula] achievable with only delayed CSIT. We also illustrate another communication scheme that uses alternating CSIT to achieve the DoF tuple [formula], which is a corner point of the DoF outer bound region derived for the hybrid CSIT model.

The DoF region of the K-user MISO BC under the alternating CSIT model was also independently investigated by [\cite=Rassouli2013], as was discovered by the authors after the completion of this work.

Although the hybrid CSIT model is applied to the 2-user MIMO BC in [\cite=Tandon2012a], the 3-user MISO BC problem is more difficult. To tackle this problem, the communication schemes developed in this paper for the 3-user BC illustrate two new ideas, layer peeling and serial interference alignment. In layer peeling, we create a structured auxiliary interference symbol which is a combination of two other interference symbols, such that this auxiliary symbol is useful in its entirety at one receiver, which does not need to decipher the constituent symbols, while simultaneously allowing another receiver to use the layered structure to peel off an already known layer and access the constituent interference symbols. Its usefulness, as is apparent from the communication schemes, lies in simultaneously providing detailed information to one receiver while hiding unnecessary details from another receiver. The communication schemes in this paper also utilize the idea of serial interference alignment, a scenario in which there exists a series of interference alignment by interference symbols, with each aligned interferencesymbol allowing the receiver to decipher the next symbol in the series, culminating in the decoding of a desired symbol.

The channel model is given in the next section, followed by theorems and proofs of the K-user and 3-user outer bounds, in Section [\ref=sec:Outer-Bound]. Section [\ref=sec:Achievability-Schemes] explains all the communication schemes in detail, and the paper concludes with Section [\ref=sec:Conclusion].

Channel Model

We start with the hybrid CSIT model for the the 3-user MISO BC, before generalizing it to the K-user MISO BC. In the hybrid CSIT model considered here for the 3-user BC, transmitter T has 3 transmitting antennas, and the 3 receivers R1,R2 and R3 have a single antenna each. The received outputs at the receivers R1,R2 and R3 are given, respectively, by the following equations :

[formula]

where, at time t, [formula] is the output at receiver Ri, [formula] is the transmitted signal, Zi(t) is the additive complex Gaussian noise at Ri, and [formula] is the channel from the transmitter to receiver Ri, i∈{1,2,3}. The transmitted signal has a power constraint of P i.e E(||Xi(t)||2)  ≤  P. The channel matrices Hi(t) are assumed to be i.i.d. over time and independent of each other. Since, additive noise does not affect the DoF region, we disregard the noise henceforth.

The main scope of this paper is the investigation of the DoF region of the 3-user BC specified above, under the following CSI assumptions:

Transmitter T learns the channels H2(t) and H3(t) with a unit delay i.e., H2(t) and H3(t) are known at the transmitter only at time t + 1.

Receivers have global CSI i.e., all receivers know all channels.

The above CSIT model is known as the hybrid CSIT model.

Let M1,M2 and M3 be the three independent messages to be sent from the transmitter to R1, R2 and R3 respectively. A rate tuple [formula] is said to be achievable if there exists a codeword spanning n channel uses, with a power constraint of P, such that the probability of error at all receivers goes to zero as n  →    ∞  , where Ri(P) =  log (|Mi|) / n. The capacity region (C(P)) of the BC is the region of all such achievable rate tuples, and the DoF is defined as the pre-log factor of the capacity region as P  →    ∞   i.e.,

[formula]

[formula]

This notion can be extended to multiple-order messages i.e., common messages intended for multiple receivers, and multiple-order DoF can consequently be defined, following the approach in [\cite=Maddah-Ali2012]. Let Mij (with [formula]) be an order-2 message intended for both Ri and Rj, at a rate of Rij(P). We define the order-2 DoF dij for the receiver pair Ri,Rj as

[formula]

The order-3 DoF d123 is similarly defined, as the common DoF for the receivers [formula].

We now define the hybrid CSIT model for the K-user MISO BC, where the transmitter has K antennas and each of the receivers Ri, [formula] has a single antenna, with the following CSI assumptions:

Transmitter T learns the channels to the first (WLOG) KP receivers instantaneously i.e., [formula] are known at the transmitter at time t.

Transmitter T learns the channels to the remaining K - KP receivers with unit delay i.e., [formula] are known at the transmitter only at time t + 1.

Receivers have global CSI i.e., all receivers know all channels.

Global CSI at the receivers is assumed for the remainder of the paper, and shall not be mentioned again for the sake of brevity.

The DoF region for the K-user MISO BC is defined analogous to the 3-user MISO BC. Let [formula] be K independent messages to be sent to [formula] respectively. A rate tuple [formula] is said to be achievable if there exists a codeword with a power constraint P spanning n channel uses, such that the probability of error goes to zero as n  →    ∞  , with Ri(P) =  log (|Mi|) / n. The capacity region C(P) is the region of all such achievable rate tuples, and the DoF is defined as the pre-log factor of the capacity region as P  →    ∞   i.e.,

[formula]

[formula]

We also define multiple-order messages e.g., MS intended for all the users in the subset [formula], at a rate [formula], and the consequent multiple-order DoF dS, in the same manner as before i.e.,

[formula]

Outer Bound

We define the notation for the ensuing theorem here. Of the K receivers in the BC, [formula] is the set of all users about whose channels the transmitter has instantaneous CSIT.Now, [formula] are the remaining users about whose channels the transmitter has only delayed CSIT, and ED is defined to be any non-empty subset of this set i.e., [formula]. We stress a subtle notational incongruity here; while EP is defined as the set of all receivers for which the transmitter has instantaneous CSIT, ED is defined as a non-empty subset of the set of all receivers with delayed CSIT. Also, we shall use EP to denote both the set of users [formula] and their corresponding receivers [formula], with a similar abuse of notation for ED and [formula]. We trust that the context will make the usage clear, without causing any confusion. πP and πD are permutation functions, that permute the sets EP and ED separately. The sequences of users in EP and ED after applying permutation πP and πD respectively are [formula] and [formula]. For any subset S of receivers, the multiple-order DoF dS has already been defined in Section [\ref=sec:Channel-Model].

An outer-bound for the DoF region of the K-user MISO BC with hybrid CSIT, with a combination of private (order-1) and common (multiple-order) messages, is

[formula]

, where πP is any permutation of the set [formula] and πD is any permutation of the set [formula].

While we provide a complete and detailed proof of the theorem later on in this section, an explanation of the above theorem and a sketch of the proof is necessary at this point. For each of the bounds described in Theorem [\ref=thm:K-user-outer-bound], we consider a subset of receivers of the original BC, which contains EP i.e., all receivers for which the transmitter has instantaneous CSIT, and a non-empty subset ED of the receivers for which the transmitter has delayed CSIT. The subsets EP and ED are separately permuted using the permutation functions πP and πD respectively, and the resultant BC is then enhanced, by giving appropriate side information at each receiver, to create the physically degraded BC [formula]. In this physically degraded BC, message [formula] is a common message meant for a subset [formula]. Let [formula] (πP or πD as the case might be) be the receiver in the subset S that is last in the degraded chain, such that any message decodable at [formula] is decodable by all the receivers in S, by the degradedness of the channel. In particular, if S contains any receivers from ED, we consider the largest integer i* such that [formula], or else if S contains only receivers from EP, we consider the largest integer i* such that [formula], and for simplicity, we denote this receiver as [formula]. Because of the degradedness of the channel, any message that is decodable at [formula] is decodable by all the receivers in the set S, thus allowing us to convert the common message MS into a private message for the receiver [formula]. For example, receiver [formula] decodes all messages [formula] such that [formula] and [formula], [formula] decodes all [formula] such that [formula] and [formula], and so on for all the other receivers. We use the fact, from [\cite=Gamal1978], that feedback does not increase the capacity of a physically degraded BC, to remove the delayed CSIT feedback from the receivers ED, and then use newly created auxiliary receivers (the details are postponed until the complete proof) to remove instantaneous CSIT about the rest of the receivers i.e, EP. Thus, we end up with a physically degraded channel without any feedback, with the common messages being converted into private messages as described above. It is well known that the capacity region of a BC without feedback depends only on the marginal distributions of its outputs, and we can thus remove the coupling between the receivers in the enhanced BC, so that the receiver [formula] now has [formula] antennas and receiver [formula] has [formula] antennas. A direct application of the results from [\cite=Huang2012] and [\cite=Vaze2012], for the DoF region of the K-user MIMO BC with no CSIT, gives the inequality shown in ([\ref=eq:K-user-outer-bound]). Permuting over all the possible subsets ED and permutation functions πP and πD gives the complete outer bound region in Theorem [\ref=thm:K-user-outer-bound].

We mentioned before the incongruity in defining EP to be the whole set receivers with instantaneous CSIT while defining ED to be a subset of the receivers with delayed CSIT. While it is possible to derive additional inequalities similar to the ones shown in Theorem [\ref=thm:K-user-outer-bound], by considering only a subset of the receivers with instantaneous CSIT instead of the whole set, a careful check will show those inequalities to be redundant. In fact, all such inequalities can be derived from the ones we already have in Theorem [\ref=thm:K-user-outer-bound], by substituting zero for the appropriate DoF symbols.

We now illustrate the kind of DoF region obtained by applying Theorem [\ref=thm:K-user-outer-bound] to the 3-user MISO BC with hybrid CSIT. In this model, defined previously in Section [\ref=sec:Channel-Model], the transmitter knows the channel to user 1 instantaneously and the channels to users 2 and 3 with a unit delay. We now obtain the following corollary.

The DoF region of the 3-user MISO BC with hybrid CSIT, with a combination of private (order-1) and common (order-2 and order-3) messages, is bounded by the following inequalities :

[formula]

We also observe that the conventional DoF region of the 3-user BC with only private messages i.e., order-1 symbols, is obtained from Theorem [\ref=thm:The-DoF-region-multi-order-symbols], by setting order-3 symbol i.e., d123 and order-2 symbols d12,d13 and d23 to zero. Thus, we have the following characterization of the outer bounds for the DoF region of the 3-user MISO BC with purely private messages.

The DoF region of the 3-user MISO BC with hybrid CSIT and only private messages is bounded by the following inequalities :

[formula]

As a special case, the DoF region, with only private messages, of the 3-user MISO BC with hybrid CSIT and the constraint d1 = 1, is bounded by the following inequalities:

[formula]

The (d1,d2,d3) outer bound is a 3-dimensional polyhedron in [formula] space, more specifically in the cubical space bounded by the origin [formula] and the planes d1 = 1, d2 = 1 and d3 = 1, shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:Complete-outer-bound]. To simplify matters, we focus our attention on the shape of this region in the d1 = 1 plane, which is obtained by fixing d1 = 1. The shape of this region is illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:The--DoF-region].

Focusing on the d1 = 1 plane of the DoF outer bound region translates to giving priority to receiver R1 over the other two receivers, since the transmitter has the maximum information about R1. In other words, we bound the DoF region while providing the maximal DoF d1 = 1 to R1, whose channel is known instantaneously at the transmitter.

Proof of Corollary [\ref=thm:The-DoF-region-multi-order-symbols]

To illustrate the techniques used in the proof of the converse, we first give the proof of Corollary [\ref=thm:The-DoF-region-multi-order-symbols] for the 3-user case, and then generalize the proof to the K-user case to prove Theorem [\ref=thm:K-user-outer-bound]. We start with the detailed proof of the inequality ([\ref=eq:converseproof]) i.e.,

[formula]

and then outline how the rest of the bounds in Theorem [\ref=thm:The-DoF-region-multi-order-symbols] can be derived using a similar technique, which follows closely that of the converse proof in [\cite=Tandon2012a].

We now create two additional auxiliary receivers R' and R'' with 3 and 2 antennas respectively. The channels to these auxiliary receivers are H'(t) and H''(t), and the corresponding outputs are Y'(t) and Y''(t) respectively, where [formula], [formula] , [formula] and [formula]. The channels H'(t) and H''(t) are known at all the receivers, but are not known at the transmitter. The new channels are mutually independent of each other as well as the rest of the channels to the original users. The outputs for the two auxiliary receivers are given by

[formula]

The additive noise Z'(t) and Z''(t) are complex normal and are independent of all other variables, and since additive noise does not affect the DoF region, we shall ignore it henceforth. We now impose the additional restriction on H'(t) and H''(t) that

[formula]

We start by giving a concise description of our original BC (OBC):

Channel outputs: Y1 at R1, Y2 at R2 and Y3 at R3.

CSIT: H1is known instantaneously, H2,H3 are known with delay.

We enhance the OBC by providing side information [formula] to R1 and Y3 to R2. This creates a physically degraded BC, described below:

Channel outputs: [formula] at R1, [formula] at R2 and Y3 at R3.

CSIT: H1 is known instantaneously, H2,H3 are known with delay.

In this T  →  R1  →  R2  →  R3 physically degraded BC, we consider the common/order-2 message M13. Because of the degraded nature of the BC, R1 can now decode any message that R3 is able to decode. Thus it is sufficient that M13 be decodable at R3. Similarly, it is sufficient that the common messages M12 be decipherable at R2 and M123 and M23 be decipherable at receiver R3. Hence, we can now convert the common message M12 into a private message for R2, and the common messages M13,M23 and M123 into private messages for receiver R3.

It is known from [\cite=Gamal1978] that feedback does not improve the capacity region of a physically degraded BC, a fact which allows us to remove the delayed feedback links from our degraded BC, to obtain the following BC:

Channel outputs: [formula] at R1, [formula] at R2 and Y3 at R3.

CSIT: H1 is known instantaneously, H2,H3 are unknown.

We now provide our auxiliary output Y' to R1 and Y'' to R2, thus enhancing our BC to:

Channel outputs: [formula] at R1, [formula] at R2 and Y3 at R3.

CSIT: H1 is known instantaneously, H2,H3,H',H'' are unknown.

The constraint we imposed earlier that [formula] shows that it is possible for receiver R1 to calculate the outputs [formula] from its knowledge of Y' and H1,H2,H3,H'. Similarly, R2 can calculate outputs [formula] from its knowledge of Y'' and H2,H3 and H''. Thus, our enhanced BC is now equivalent to the following BC:

Channel outputs: Y' at R1, Y'' at R2 and Y3 at R3.

CSIT: H1 is known instantaneously, H2,H3,H',H'' are unknown.

We now have an equivalent BC with three outputs [formula], none of whose channel gains are known at the transmitter. The transmitter thus has no need of the knowledge of H1, and our enhanced BC becomes:

Channel outputs: Y' at R1, Y'' at R2 and Y3 at R3.

CSIT: H',H'',H3 are unknown.

Thus, in our final version, we have a 3-user MIMO BC with no CSIT, 3 antennas at the transmitter and 3 antennas (from our construction of Y') at R1, 2 antennas (our construction of Y'') at R2 and 1 antenna at R3. Also, as per the discussion above, in addition to their original private messages, Tx has a private message M12 for R2 and private messages M13,M23 and M123 for R3. From [\cite=Huang2012] and [\cite=Vaze2012], we know that the DoF region of this MIMO BC with no CSIT is given by

[formula]

thus proving inequality ([\ref=eq:converseproof]) i.e.,

[formula]

Similarly, by creating the physically degraded BC T  →  R1  →  R3  →  R2, and converting the common messages M123,M12,M23 into private messages for R2 and M13 into a private messages for R3, we prove inequality ([\ref=eq:9]),

[formula]

The proof of the other inequalities in Theorem [\ref=thm:The-DoF-region-multi-order-symbols] follows a similar reasoning. Inequalities ([\ref=eq:1])-([\ref=eq:3]) are just the MIMO outer bounds for a single antenna receiver, while inequalities [\ref=eq:pair-begin]-[\ref=eq:pair-end] are proven by using the above technique on the receiver pairs [formula] and [formula] respectively. Since the reasoning is so similar, we do not mention it explicitly. We note that the 2-user outer bound obtained by considering only receivers R2 and R3 is redundant, and is obtained from inequalities [\ref=eq:converseproof]-[\ref=eq:9], by setting d1,d12,d13,d123 = 0.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:K-user-outer-bound]

We now prove Theorem [\ref=thm:K-user-outer-bound] in all its generality. As defined in the Section ([\ref=sec:Outer-Bound]), [formula] is the set of users about whom the transmitter has instantaneous CSIT, while [formula] are the remaining users about whom the transmitter has only delayed CSIT available, and ED is now defined to be any non-empty subset of this latter set i.e.,receivers with delayed CSIT. πP and πD are permutation functions, that permute the sets EP and ED respectively. We now consider the BC consisting of receivers [formula] i.e., a combination of ALL receivers for which instantaneous CSIT exists and the subset ED of receivers for which the transmitter has delayed CSIT, and give below a concise description of this BC :

Channel outputs: Yi at Ri, [formula]

CSIT: [formula] known instantaneously , [formula] known with delay.

We now consider a permutation πP of the set EP and a permutation πD of the set ED, and enhance the BC by providing the output of receiver RπD(i) to receivers [formula] , [formula] , and the output of receiver RπP(i) to receivers [formula], [formula]. This creates a physically degraded BC, described below:

Channel outputs: [formula] at RπP(1),, [formula] at RπD(1),, [formula] at [formula],

CSIT: [formula] are known instantaneously , [formula] are known with delay.

In this [formula] physically degraded BC, let [formula] be the multiple-order message intended for all receivers in a set [formula] . If S contains any receivers from ED, we consider the largest integer i* such that [formula], or else if S contains only receivers from EP, we consider the largest integer i* such that [formula]. For simplicity, we denote this receiver as [formula]. Because of the degradedness of the channel, any message that is decodable at [formula] is decodable by all the receivers in the set S, thus allowing us to convert the common message MS into a private message for the receiver [formula]. For example, receiver [formula] decodes all messages [formula] such that [formula] and [formula], [formula] decodes all [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] and so on for all the other receivers.

It is known from [\cite=Gamal1978] that feedback does not improve the capacity region of a physically degraded BC. This allows us to remove the delayed feedback links from our degraded BC, obtaining the following "enhanced" BC:

Channel outputs: [formula] at RπP(1), , [formula] at RπD(1),, [formula] at [formula],

CSIT: [formula] known instantaneously , [formula] unknown.

We now create [formula] additional auxiliary receivers [formula], the first receiver [formula] with [formula] antennas, and each consecutive receiver having one less antenna than its predecessor. The outputs at the receivers are denoted as [formula], and the corresponding channels are similarly labeled [formula] , the time indices being suppressed for brevity. The new channels are mutually independent of each other as well as the rest of the channels to the original receivers, and are known instantaneously at all the receivers, but are unknown at the transmitter. We now impose the following restriction on each of the newly created channels :

[formula]

We provide the auxiliary output Y'πP(i)(t) to the receiver [formula], and the auxiliary output Y'πD(i)(t) to the receiver [formula]. Thus, the BC is now enhanced to the following state:

Channel outputs: [formula] at RπP(1), , [formula] at RπD(1),, [formula] at RπD(1),[formula] at [formula],

CSIT: [formula] are known instantaneously , [formula] unknown, [formula] are unknown, [formula] are unknown.

The constraints we imposed earlier on the span of the auxiliary channels in equations [\ref=eq:constraint-begin]-[\ref=eq:constraint-end] show that the output at the [formula] antennas of [formula] allow receiver πP(1) to calculate [formula] from its knowledge of [formula] and [formula] and H'πP(1). A similar reasoning follows for the rest of the receivers in the enhanced BC, and the enhanced BC takes the form :

Channel outputs: Y'πP(1) at RπP(1), Y'πP(2) at RπP(2),, Y'πD(1) at RπD(1),, [formula] at RπD(1),[formula] at [formula],

CSIT: [formula] known instantaneously , [formula] unknown, [formula] unknown, [formula] unknown.

We have thus created an equivalent BC with outputs [formula], none of whose channel gains are known at the transmitter. In this setting, the transmitter thus has no need for its instantaneous knowledge of HπP(i), i∈EP, thus making out enhanced BC equivalent to the following final BC:

Channel outputs: Y'πP(1) at RπP(1), Y'πP(2) at RπP(2),, Y'πD(1) at RπD(1),, [formula] at RπD(1), [formula] at [formula],

CSIT: [formula] unknown, [formula] unknown.

In this final version, we have a [formula]-user MIMO BC with no CSIT, K antennas at the transmitter, with [formula] antennas at receiver [formula] and [formula] antennas at receiver πD(i), i∈ED, with private messages [formula] as described above. From [\cite=Huang2012] and [\cite=Vaze2012], we know that the DoF region of this MIMO BC with no CSIT is given by

[formula]

Allowing for all possible non-empty subsets ED of [formula] and all possible permutations πP and πD of EP and ED, respectively, in inequality [\ref=eq:K-user-seed-eqn] gives Theorem [\ref=thm:K-user-outer-bound].

New Communication Schemes

A Scheme achieving [formula] DoF

In Fig. [\ref=fig:Interference-alignment-scheme-1], we present an interference alignment scheme that achieves the [formula] DoF tuple for the 3-user MISO BC under the hybrid CSIT model. We show the achievability of this DoF tuple by coding over 6 time slots, during which the transmitter sends 6 independent data symbols (DSs) u1,u2,u3,u4,u5,u6 to receiver R1, 2 independent DSs v1 and v2 to R2 and 2 independent DSs w1 and w2 to R3, with all the data symbols being successfully decoded at their intended receivers. In the following paragraphs, we explain the transmission and decoding strategy at each time slot in detail. For the sake of clarity, we divide the complete scheme into two phases, an initial data dissemination phase and a subsequent data disambiguation phase.

At t = 1, the transmitter transmits 3 DSs u1,u2 and u3 intended for R1 and 2 DSs v1 and v2 intended for R2. Since the transmitter has perfect knowledge of the channel to R1, it utilizes this knowledge to zero-force v1 and v2 at R1. More precisely, Tx transmits the following signal

[formula]

where B(1) is the pre-coding matrix that performs transmit beamforming in the null space of H1(1) i.e., H1(1)B(1) = 0. In Fig. [\ref=fig:Interference-alignment-scheme-1], this zero-forcing at R1 is denoted by a [formula] sign besides the symbol that is zero-forced, in this case v1 and v2. The outputs at the three receivers are as follows :

[formula]

At t = 2, the transmitter transmits DSs u4,u5 and u6 intended for R1 and w1,w2 intended for R3, again using a zero-forcing transmission strategy similar to the one used in the previous time slot. w1 and w2 are zero-forced at R1 using a beamforming matrix B(2), such that H1(2)B(2) = 0. The outputs at the three receivers are as follows:

[formula]

We note here that Fig. [\ref=fig:Interference-alignment-scheme-1] depicts the same linear combinations (LCs) l1,...,l6 , m1,m2 and n1,n2, without mentioning their underlying DSs ui, vi and wi respectively. By creating the convention that the symbol l e.g. l1,l2 etc. shall henceforth denote linear combinations of DSs ui; m1,m2 shall denote linear combinations of vi and n1,n2 shall denote linear combinations of wi, we dispense with the need to mention the underlying DSs while mentioning the relevant linear combinations. We stress the fact that all the linear combinations are almost surely independent, owing to the generic and independent nature of the channel matrices assumed at the outset. For the sake of brevity, we will not mention the channel or beamforming matrices henceforth, and directly deal with the linear combinations created at the receivers.

At the end of the Data Flooding phase,there are 6 LCs i.e., l1,...,l6 of the 6 DSs u1,...,u6 intended for R1, of which R1 has knows only l1 and l4, without any interference. Thus, R1 needs to obtain the remaining four LCs in the next phase, so that it can have six independent linear combinations of u1,...,u6, which would be sufficient to decode all of its intended DSs. Sending the LCs l2,l3,l5 and l6 to R1 shall therefore be one of the goals of the next phase.

The situation at R2 is a bit more complicated. Of the two LCs m1 and m2 that R2 can use to decode its intended DSs, R2 observes only m1 in this phase, at t = 1, but with an added interference l2 . Thus, if R2 learns the LC l2 in the next phase, it can cancel out this interference and consequently obtain its desired LC m1. It is to be noted that the LC l2 therefore plays a dual role, helping R1 to decode its intended DSs while simultaneously aiding R2 to cancel out interference from its received signal. R2 also needs to be learn its second LC m2 in the next phase. Thus, another goal of the next phase shall be to ensure that R2 learns both l2 and m2. Similarly, in the next phase, R3 needs to learn l6 (to cancel out the interference from Y3(2) and obtain n2) as well as the LC n1.

At t = 3, the transmitter sends two symbols l2 and l5 + n1 (the knowledge of which it has at t = 3 due to delayed CSIT of the channel to R2 at times 1 and 2). l5 + n1 is transmitted in the null space of the channel to R1 at t = 3 (made possible by the instantaneous CSIT from R1), thus allowing R1 to learn l2 without any interference. R2 gets a linear combination of l2 and l5 + n1, from which it cancels the contribution of l5 + n1(of which it has prior knowledge from t = 2) and acquires l2. R3, on the other hand, sees a linear combination of l2 and l5 + n1, from which we group the interference due to user 1 DSs into the the auxiliary symbol k1  =  α1l2  +  β1l5 (with α1 and β1 depending on the channel from transmitter to R3 at t = 3), so that Y3(3) = k1  +  β1n1, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:Interference-alignment-scheme-1].

From our discussion earlier, we recall that l2 is useful at both R1 and R2, simultaneously providing a desired LC to R1 and allowing R2 to acquire its required DS m1 by interference cancellation. Another way of interpreting this is to observe that l2, while directly useful as a LC at R1, aligns with the interference already present at R2 at t = 1. We use another layer of interference alignment to motivate our use of the "composite" interference symbol l5 + n1 at t = 3. The symbol l5 + n1 provides R3 with its desired LC n1 (albeit with an interference k1), and at the same time aligns with the interference seen at R2 at t = 2. This interference alignment of l5 + n1 at R2 allows R2 to acquire l2 (by canceling out the interference l5 + n1 at t = 3), which in turn is now aligned with the interference at R2 at t = 1. We thus have a series of interference alignment by symbols, in this case l5 + n1  →  l2  →  m1, where each aligned interference symbol allows the receiver (here R2) to decipher the next symbol in the series, which in turn is also aligned at the same receiver, finally culminating in the decoding of a desired symbol, here m1, at that receiver. We call this idea serial interference alignment.

The idea of serial interference alignment is repeated at t = 4, this time focusing on aligning the interference at R3. The transmitter sends l6 and l3 + m2, the latter in the null space of the channel to R1 at t = 4. This allows R1 to learn l6 without any interference, while R3 uses its prior knowledge of l3 + m2 (from the output at t = 1) to subtract out its contribution and learn l6. R2 sees a linear combination of l6 and l3 + m2, which we write in terms of the auxiliary symbol k2  =  α2l6  +  β2l3 , once again combining the interference due to user 1 DSs and α2 and β2 depending on the channel to R2 at t = 4, so that Y2(4) = k2  +  β2m2. The serial interference alignment chain l3 + m2  →  l6  →  n2 allows R3 to successfully obtain its desired LC n2.

At time t = 5, the transmitter sends k1 and at time t = 2 it sends k2, both of which are linear combinations of symbols of user 1. Upon receiving these, R1 is able to cancel the contribution of l2 in k1 and l6 in k2 to obtain the two remaining LCs l5 and l3 for a total of 6 linear combinations l1, , l6 , thus allowing it to decode all its DSs u1,,u6. Because R2 obtains k2 at t = 6 it can subtract its contribution to Y2(4) and obtain the second linear combination m2 it desires, so that along with its knowledge of m1 it can decode v1 and v2. Similarly, by obtaining k1 at t = 5, R3 can subtract its contribution to Y3(3) and obtain the second linear combination n1 it desires so that along with its knowledge of n2 it can decode all its DSs w1 and w2.

The motivation behind grouping the interference from user 1 DSs into auxiliary interference symbol k1 and k2 becomes clear now. We observe that at t = 5, R3 needed only a particular linear combination of l2 and l5 i.e., k1, without incurring the additional expense of learning l2 and l5 individually, to cancel out the interference k1 from Y3(3) and obtain its desired LC n1. At the same time, R1 also utilized k1 by using its previous knowledge of l2 (from Y1(3)) to peel off l2 from k1 and access its desired LC l5 . Thus, the motivation behind creating the auxiliary interference symbol i.e., k1 was to have a structured symbol which is useful in its entirety at one receiver (R3), but whose additional layered structure simultaneously allows another receiver (R1) to peel off already known layers (l2) and access more detailed useful information (l5). We name this idea as layer peeling. Its usefulness, as is apparent from this communication scheme, lies in simultaneously providing detailed information to one receiver while hiding unnecessary details from another receiver. Layer peeling is again used in the context of k2 and the receivers R1 and R2 at t = 6, where R1 peels off l6 from k2 to access its desired LC l3 and R2 uses k2 in its entirety to cancel out interference from Y2(4). We note here that although R2 can compute l5 at t = 5 and R3 can computer l3 at t = 6 using layer peeling, this knowledge has no particular use at either of the two receivers.

Alternate Scheme for achieving [formula] DoF

Fig. [\ref=fig:Alternate-interference-alignment] depicts another communication scheme for the same [formula] DoF tuple. Because of its similarity to the previous communication scheme, we give here a brief description, emphasizing only the aspects in which it differs from the former scheme.

As before, we show the achievability of this DoF tuple by coding over 6 time slots, by sending 6 independent DSs u1,u2,u3,u4,u5,u6 to receiver R1, 2 independent DSs v1 and v2 to R2 and 2 independent DSs w1 and w2 to R3, such that all DSs are successfully decoded at their intended receivers. Once again, we divide the complete scheme into two phases, an initial data dissemination phase and a subsequent data disambiguation phase.

The major difference between the present scheme and the previous one lies in the data dissemination phase. While previously the DSs intended for R2 (v1,v2) and the DSs intended for R3 (w1,w2) were transmitted during separate time slots t = 1 and t = 2 respectively, this scheme transmits v1,v2,w1,w2 along with u1,u2,u3 at t = 1, thus causing a different interference pattern at the receivers. The transmitter uses its instantaneous knowledge of the channel to R1 to send v1,v2,w1,w2 in the null space of H1. More precisely, the following signal is transmitted,

[formula]

where B(1) and C(1) are the pre-coding matrices that perform transmit beamforming in the null space of H1(1) i.e., H1(1)B(1) = 0 and H1(1)C(1) = 0. The outputs at the three receivers are denoted as follows:

[formula]

For further simplification, the interference terms are grouped in brackets at the receivers R2 and R3 in Fig. [\ref=fig:Alternate-interference-alignment]. We stick to the previous notation of denoting the linear combinations (LCs) of ui by the symbol l, vi by the symbol m and wi by the symbol n respectively. We also note that all the linear combinations are almost surely independent, owing to the generic and independent nature of the channel matrices.

At t = 2, the transmitter transmits the symbols u4,u5 and u6, thus creating the independent linear combinations l4,l5 and l6 at receivers R1,R2 and R3 respectively. In the next phase, R1 needs the LCs l2,l3,l5 and l6, while R2 needs to learn the LC m2 and the composite interference term l2 + n1. Similarly, R3 needs n1 and the composite interference term l3 + m2 in the next phase.

At t = 3, the transmitter sends two symbols l5 and l2 + n1 (the knowledge of which it has at t = 3 due to delayed CSIT of channel to R2 at time 1), the latter in the null space of the channel from the transmitter to R1 at t = 3 (since the receiver has instantaneous knowledge of the channel to R1). R1 acquires its desired linear combination l5, while R2 sees a linear combination of l5 and l2 + n1, from which it removes the contribution of l5 (which it learnt at t = 2) to acquire l2 + n1. R3 on the other hand observes a linear combination of l5 and l2 + n1, which we write in terms of an auxiliary symbol k1  =  α1l5  +  β1l2 (i.e., the interference due to user 1 DSs, α1 and β1 dependent on the channel to R3 at t = 3) so that Y3(3) = k1  +  β1n1 .

The transmission strategy is similar at t = 4, where the symbols l6 and l3 + m2 are transmitted, the latter in the null space of the channel to R1. R1 acquires l6, and R3 uses its previous knowledge of l6 to obtain l3 + m2. The situation at R2 parallels that of R3 at t = 3, where we let Y2(4) = k2  +  β2m2 , with k2  =  α2l6  +  β2m2 (i.e., interference due to user 1's DSs with α2 and β2 depending on channel from transmitter to R2 at t = 4).

Thus, at t = 3,4, the transmitter sends 2 useful linear combinations l5 and l6 to R1, the composite interference symbols l2 + n1 and l3 + m2 to receivers R2 and R3 respectively, which then use this knowledge to cancel out the interference from Y2(1) and Y3(1) to obtain their respective desired linear combinations m1 and n2. At the same time, R2 and R3 are also provided with their other desired linear combination i.e., m2 and n1, albeit with additional interference k2 and k1 respectively.

At time t = 5 the transmitter sends k1 and at time t = 6 it sends k2. Upon receiving these, R1 is able to cancel the contribution of l5 in k1 and l6 in k2 to obtain the two remaining linear combinations l2 and l3 for a total of 6 linear combinations l1,...,l6 so that it can obtain its DSs u1,...,u6. Because R2 obtains k2 at t = 6 it can subtract its contribution to Y2(4) and obtain the second linear combination m2 it desires, so that along with its knowledge of m1 it can decode v1 and v2. Similarly, because R3 obtains k1 at t = 5 it can subtract its contribution to Y3(3) and obtain the second linear combination n1 it desires so that along with its knowledge of n2 it can decode its DSs w1 and w2.

Compactness of Communication Scheme in Fig. [\ref=fig:Alternate-interference-alignment]

We refer back to Fig. [\ref=fig:The--DoF-region], which shows [formula] as one of the extreme points of the DoF region, which translates to [formula] DSs sent over 6 time slots. Since the communication scheme presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:Alternate-interference-alignment] successfully sends [formula] DSs over 6 time slots, it is tempting to try and transmit an extra DS to either R2 or R3 using the same scheme in the hope of achieving the aforementioned DoF extreme point. We argue in the following paragraphs against such a possibility for the present scheme, with the help of the outer bounds proved in Theorem [\ref=thm:The-DoF-region-multi-order-symbols].

At time t = 1, the transmitter transmits 3 independent DSs intended for R1, which is the maximum number of independent DSs that can be transmitted simultaneously over 3 antennas. Visualizing the 3- antenna system at Tx as a 3- dimensional vector space, the null space of H1 is a 2-dimensional subspace of this vector space. To zero-force v1 and v2 (intended for R2) at R1, we need to transmit the DSs using transmit vectors in this 2-dimensional null space. More precisely, the last two rows of the beamforming matrix B should lie in this 2-dimensional null space, which means that we can send a maximum of two independent DSs in the same time slot to R2. The same holds true for the DSs w1,w2 intended for R3. Hence, we see that the transmission strategy at t = 1, under the constraint of zero-forcing vi and wi at R1, is tight and can not be improved upon.

At the end of t = 1, we have the following requirements for the next 5 time slots, t = 2,...,6:

[formula]

We reformulate these requirements in terms of order-1 and order-2 DSs, to be sent in 5 time slots , as

[formula]

We denote the cardinality of the order-1 symbols as d'1,d'2,d'3 and the order-2 symbols as d'12,d'13,d'23. From the requirements mentioned above, we obtain the following values for the cardinality of the various symbols:

[formula]

We now reformulate inequalities ([\ref=eq:converseproof]) and ([\ref=eq:9]) in terms of the cardinality of the symbols, keeping in mind that all the symbols need to be transmitted in the next 5 time slots, we have

[formula]

Substituting the values of the cardinality from equations ([\ref=eq:23])-([\ref=eq:26]) in the above inequalities, we obtain the following inequalities:

[formula]

Any attempt at sending an extra DS to R2 in these 5 time slots i.e., setting d'2 = 1, would violate inequality ([\ref=eq:28]). Similarly, sending an extra DS to R3 would violate inequality ([\ref=eq:27]). This proves the impossibility of sending an extra DS to either R2 or R3 to achieve the DoF extreme point [formula] using the communication scheme depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:Alternate-interference-alignment].

Communication Scheme for achieving [formula] DoF under the Alternating CSIT Model

In Fig. [\ref=fig:-Alternating-CSIT-Example], we illustrate an communication scheme that achieves [formula] DoF for the 3-user MISO BC under the alternating CSIT model, where we show the achievability of the DoF tuple by coding over 9 time slots. Under the alternating CSIT model considered for this particular achievable scheme, the BC remains in the original hybrid CSIT state for 7 time slots, during which the transmitter has instantaneous CSIT about the channel to receiver R1 and delayed CSIT about the channel to receivers R2 and R3., and for the remaining 2 time slots, the transmitter switches to a new CSIT state, where it has perfect CSIT about the channels to receivers R2 and R3 and no CSIT about the channel to receiver R1, a CSIT state we abbreviate as NPP (no CSIT, perfect CSIT, perfect CSIT).

Over the 9 time slots, the transmitter sends 9 independent DSs u1,u2,,u9 to receiver R1, 4 independent DSs v1,v2,v3 and v4 to R2 and 4 independent DSs w1,w2,w3 and w4 to R3, with all the DSs being successfully decoded at their intended receivers, using a transmission and decoding strategy that we explain in detail in the following paragraphs. We divide the scheme into 3 different phases, data dissemination phase, data disambiguation phase and a new NPP phase. We note that in both the data dissemination and data disambiguation phase, the transmitter is in the original hybrid state, but switches to the NPP CSIT state in the NPP phase.

At time t = 1, the transmitter sends 3 DSs u1,u2 and u3 for R1, v1 and v2 for R2 and w1 and w2 for R3, using its instantaneous knowledge of the channel to R1 at t = 1 to send v1,v2,w1,w2 in the null space of H1. More precisely, the following signal is transmitted,

[formula]

where B(1) and C(1) are the pre-coding matrices that perform transmit beamforming in the null space of H1(1) i.e., H1(1)B(1) = 0 and H1(1)C(1) = 0. In Fig. [\ref=fig:Alternate-interference-alignment], this zero-forcing is denoted by a [formula] sign besides the symbols that are zero-forced at R1. The outputs at the three receivers are precisely as follows:

[formula]

We again use the symbol l for linear combinations of ui, m for linear combinations of vi and n for linear combinations of wi. Also, all the linear combinations are almost surely linearly independent, owing to the generic nature of the channel matrices.

At t = 2, the transmitter uses the exact same strategy as in the first time slot, but now the DSs it sends are u4,u5 and u6 for R1 and v3,v4 for R2 and w3,w4 for R3, with v3,v4,w3,w4 being transmitted in the null space of the channel to R1 at t = 2. Thus, the outputs at each of the receivers are

[formula]

where we have grouped the interference terms separately. At t = 3, the transmitter transmits the remaining DSs u7,u8 and u9, thus creating the LCs l7,l8 and l9 at R1,R2 and R3 respectively. At the end of this time slot, all the DSs have been transmitted, and the rest of the scheme focuses on canceling out the interference to allow each of the receivers to decode their respective DSs.

At the end of the data dissemination phase, of the 9 linear combinations l1,,l9 of the DSs u1,,u9, R1 knows only 3 LCs and needs to acquire the other 6 LCs to be able to decode all its DSs . On the other hand, the 2 LCs m1 and m3 that R2 sees comes added with the composite interference symbols l2 + n1 and l5 + n3 respectively, both of which need to be learnt in the next phase. R2 also needs to learn the remaining of its desired LCS i.e., m2 and m4. The situation at R3 is similar, and it needs to learn the composite interference symbols l3 + m2 and l6 + m4 as well as its own desired LCs n1 and n3.

At t = 4, the transmitter sends two symbols l8 and l2 + n1 (the knowledge of which it has at t = 3 due to delayed CSIT of channel to R2 at time 1), the latter in the null space of the channel from the transmitter to R1 at t = 3 (since the receiver has instantaneous knowledge of the channel to R1). R1 acquires its desired linear combination l8, while R2 sees a linear combination of l8 and l2 + n1, from which it removes the contribution of l8 (which it learnt at t = 3) to acquire l2 + n1. We thus utilize the idea of serial interference alignment introduced earlier, with the alignment chain being l8  →  l2 + n1  →  m1, culminating in R2 obtaining its desired LC m1 at the end of the chain. R3 on the other hand observes a linear combination of l8 and l2 + n1, which we write in terms of an auxiliary symbol [formula] , where the bracket signifies a linear combination, with the coefficients depending on the channel to R3 at t = 4, so that [formula] . To simplify notation, we shall henceforth use brackets to denote a linear combination, the coefficients depending on the channel to the receiver in that particular time slot at which the linear combination is created.

The transmission strategy is similar at t = 4, where the symbols l9 and l3 + m2 are transmitted, the latter in the null space of the channel to R1. R1 acquires l6, and R3 uses its previous knowledge of l6 to obtain l3 + m2. The serial alignment chain at R3 is now l9  →  l3 + m2  →  n2. The situation at R2 parallels that of R3 at t = 3, where we let [formula] , with [formula] (i.e., interference due to user 1's DSs ).

Thus, at t = 4,5, the transmitter sends 2 useful linear combinations l8 and l9 to R1, the composite interference symbols l2 + n1 and l3 + m2 to receivers R2 and R3 respectively, which then use this knowledge to cancel out the interference from Y2(1) and Y3(1) to obtain their respective desired linear combinations m1 and n2. At the same time, R2 and R3 are also provided with their other desired linear combination i.e., m2 and n1, albeit with additional interference k2 and k1 respectively.

At time t = 6, the transmitter transmits k1 and l6 + m4, the latter in the null space of the channel to R1 at t = 6, resulting in R1 seeing k1 and doing layer peeling on it i.e., canceling out l8, to obtain its desired LC l2. R2 also cancels out the contribution of l8 (which it knows from t = 3) from k1, and thus obtains a linear combination of l2,l6 and m4, in which we group the interference due to user 1 DSs into the auxiliary symbol [formula], a linear combination of l2 and l6, and thus [formula] . R3 sees a linear combination of k1 and l6 + m4, which we have shown separately in Fig. [\ref=fig:-Alternating-CSIT-Example] to emphasize the fact that R3 sees l6 + m4 with the same interference k1 that it encountered at t = 4.

At time t = 7, the transmitter similarly sends k2 and l5 + n3, the latter in the null space of the channel to R1 at t = 6, resulting in R1 seeing k2 and canceling out l9, to obtain its desired LC l3. R3 also cancels out the contribution of l9 (which it knows from t = 3) from k2, and thus obtains a linear combination of l3,l5 and n3, in which we group the interference due to user 1 DSs into the auxiliary symbol [formula], and thus [formula] . R2 sees a linear combination of k2 and l5 + n3, which we have again shown separately to emphasize that R3 sees l5 + n3 with the same interference k2 that it encountered at t = 5.

Thus, at t = 6,7, R1 obtains two useful linear combinations l2 and l3, while both R2 and R3 acquire one desired LC each i.e., m4 and n3, but with added interference k3 and k4 respectively. We note that layer peeling is once again the motivation behind creating the auxiliary interference symbols k3 and k4, e.g. in the subsequent NPP phase, k3 is useful in its entirety at R3 and also manages to deliver the desired LC l6 at R1. The other major idea is to repeat the previously seen interference k1 at R3 (at t = 5) and k2 at R2 (at t = 6), respectively. This sets up the endgame where knowledge of k1 at R3 will lead simultaneously to interference cancellation from Y3(4) which provides n1 at R3 and the unwrapping of the serial alignment chain k1  →  l6 + m4  →  n4 which furnishes n4 at R3. A similar logic shows that knowledge of k2 at R2 in the subsequent phase allows R2 to acquire m3 and m4. This is our motivation to switch to the NPP CSIT mode for the next 2 time slots, and use the perfect knowledge of channels to R2 and R3 to deliver the auxiliary interference symbols k2,k3 to R2 and k1,k4 to R3 without any interference.

At t = 8, the transmitter sends k1 and k3, in the null space of the channels to R2 and R3 at t = 8 respectively (possible due to the now instantaneous knowledge about the channels from the transmitter to R2 and R3). R1 sees a linear combination of k1 and k3 , from which it cancels out the contribution of l2(known previously at t = 6) and l8 (known at t = 4) to obtain its required DS l6. Since k1 is zero-forced at R2, R2 sees only k3, and uses it to cancel the interference from Y2(6) to obtain its desired LC m4. R3 is able to acquire k1 without any interference, because of zero-forcing of k3 at R3. As discussed in the previous paragraph, knowledge of k1 lets R3 cancel interference from Y3(4) to obtain its desired LC n1 and also allows R3 to do interference cancellation from Y3(6) to obtain l6 + m4, which in turn allows interference cancellation from Y3(2) to provide R3 with another desired LC n4, a chain of events that is elegantly described by the serial alignment chain k1  →  l6 + m4  →  n4.

In the final time slot t = 9, the transmitter sends k4 and k2, respectively in the null space of the channels to R2 and R3 at t = 9. R1 uses its previous knowledge of l3 and l9 to cancel out their contribution from the linear combination of k2 and k4 to obtain its final required LC l5. R2, which sees only k2 free from interference, uses k2 to cancel interference from Y2(5) to obtain the desired LC m2 and also to unravel the serial alignment chain k2  →  l5 + n3  →  m3 (from Y3(9),Y3(7) and Y3(2)) to obtain its final desired LC m3. R3 sees an interference free version of k4, and it cancels its contribution from Y3(7) to obtain the LC n3.

At the end of the 9 time slots, R1 has the LCs l1,,l9, and can thus decode its DSs u1,,u9. R2 possesses the LCs m1,,m4 which enable it to decode all its desired DSs v1,,v4, and similarly, R3 uses the LCs n1,,n4 to decode its DSs w1,,w4.

Conclusion

In this paper, we obtain an outer bound for the DoF region of the K-user MISO BC in the most general hybrid CSIT setting, where an arbitrary number of receivers are in the instantaneous CSIT mode and the rest of the receivers are in the delayed CSIT mode. We specialize these results for the 3-user MISO BC, where the transmitter has instantaneous CSIT about one receiver and delayed CSIT about the other two. We develop new communication schemes for the 3-user BC for the hybrid CSIT model, and demonstrate achievability of a sum-DoF that is more than that obtainable only with delayed CSIT. We also show how an outer bound corner-point for the hybrid CSIT can be achieved using alternating CSIT.
