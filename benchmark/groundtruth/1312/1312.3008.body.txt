A geometric realization of the ultradiscrete periodic Toda lattice via tropical plane curves

Introduction

The discovery of a cellular automaton possessing solitonical nature by Takahashi - Satsuma in 1990 [\cite=TS90] was a trigger of various subsequent studies upon new integrable dynamical systems governed by piecewise linear maps on the real spaces of finite or infinite dimension. Such dynamical systems are called ultradiscrete integrable systems and their evolutions are described by means of the max-plus algebra. The most powerful tool to investigate ultradiscrete integrable systems known as the procedure of ultradiscretization was proposed by Tokihiro et al. in 1996 [\cite=TTMS96]. By using this procedure, ultradiscrete integrable systems are directly connected with the discrete integrable systems such as the discrete KdV, the discrete Toda and the discrete KP equations. Namely, evolution equations, exact solutions and conserved quantities of such discrete integrable systems are simultaneously reduced to those of ultradiscrete integrable systems by applying ultradiscretization [\cite=NT98] [\cite=TTM00] [\cite=IMNS04]. With ultradiscretization as a booster, ultradiscrete integrable systems have intensively been studied by using various mathematical tool such as combinatorics [\cite=MSTTT97] [\cite=FOY00] [\cite=YYT03] [\cite=NY04], crystal bases of quantum groups [\cite=HIK99] [\cite=HHIKTT01] [\cite=HKOTY02] [\cite=IKT12], tropical geometry [\cite=Nobe08] [\cite=KNT08] [\cite=KKNT09] [\cite=Nobe11] [\cite=IKT12] and so forth.

In this article, we focus our interests on the geometric aspects of ultradiscrete integrable systems. The first step of the studies on the geometry of ultradiscrete integrable systems was made by Kimijima - Tokihiro in 2002 [\cite=KT02]. They applied the procedure of ultradiscretization to the periodic discrete Toda lattice (pdTL) and their quasi-periodic solutions, and linearized time evolution of the ultradiscrete periodic Toda lattice (UD-pTL) on the real torus corresponding to the Jacobian of the spectral curve of the pdTL. They also solved the initial value problem to the UD-pTL of genus 1 and constructed its quasi-periodic solutions by means of the ultradiscrete elliptic theta functions. Subsequent steps were made by Inoue - Takenawa [\cite=IT08] [\cite=IT09] and Iwao et al. [\cite=IIMT09] [\cite=Iwao10] in terms of tropical geometry [\cite=IMS07] and ultradiscretization procedure. They solved the initial value problems to the UD-pTL of arbitrary genus by using tropical hyperelliptic curves, their tropical Jacobians, ultradiscrete theta functions and ultradiscretization of Abelian integrals. Through their works, we have gradually recognized the advantage in applying the method of tropical geometry to ultradiscrete integrable systems.

We will go a step further and try to realize the UD-pTL completely in the framework of tropical geometry. In section [\ref=sec:ATHCPBS] and [\ref=sec:Addition], we introduce the UD-pTL and its spectral curve and realize time evolution of the UD-pTL as an addition of points on the Picard group of its spectral curve. We give explicit formulae for the eigenvectors of the Lax matrix of the pdTL in terms of the conserved quantities in section [\ref=sec:TropicalEigenvectorMap]. Moreover, we realize the tropical eigenvector maps geometrically by using intersection of the spectral curve of the UD-pTL and tropical plane curves derived from the eigenvector of the Lax matrix. In section [\ref=sec:AGROP], we translate the addition of points on the Picard group into intersection of tropical plane curves. These tropical plane curves, one of which is the spectral curve of the UD-pTL, are explicitly given by using the conserved quantities of the UD-pTL. If we restrict the UD-pTL to take its initial values in positive integers then its time evolution is realized as a motion of balls in an array of boxes and is called the periodic box-ball system (pBBS) [\cite=YT02]. In [\ref=sec:example], we present a concrete computation of the geometric realization of the pBBS for a certain initial condition by using intersection of tropical plane curves. We observe that the time evolution of the pBBS is realized as a motion of several points on a tropical hyperelliptic curve.

Ultradiscrete periodic Toda lattice and periodic box-ball system

Let us consider the dynamical system [formula]

[formula]

given by

[formula]

Here we define

[formula]

for [formula]. Moreover, we assume that [formula] and

[formula]

When we iterate the map ζ we use the notation

[formula]

for [formula].

We call the dynamical system generated by ([\ref=eq:pbbs]) the ultradiscrete periodic Toda lattice (UD-pTL). It is well known that the UD-pTL is reduced from the periodic discrete Toda lattice or the periodic discrete KdV equation through the procedure of ultradiscretization [\cite=TTMS96]. In particular, if the variables [formula] and [formula] take their values in positive integers then the dynamical system is called the periodic box-ball system (pBBS) [\cite=YT02] [\cite=KT02]. The pBBS is obtained from the box-ball system (BBS), which was introduced by Takahashi - Satsuma as a soliton cellular automaton [\cite=TS90], by imposing a periodic boundary condition.

The pBBS can be realized by using an array of finite boxes and balls as follows. Consider an array of [formula] boxes whose both ends are connected each other. Assume that we have [formula] balls. Put a ball into an arbitrary box in the array of boxes. Successively, put a ball into the next box of the occupied one to the right. Repeat this procedure J1 times then we obtain a sub-array of consecutive J1 boxes each of which is occupied with a ball. For the adjoining W1 boxes of the right-most occupied one to the right, we do not put balls into them. Thus we obtain a sub-array of consecutive W1 empty boxes adjoining the sub-array of J1 occupied ones. Next, put a ball into the next box of the right-most box in the sub-array of W1 empty boxes to the right, and repeat the above procedure for J2 and W2. Then we obtain a sub-array of consecutive J2 occupied boxes and that of consecutive W2 empty boxes adjoining to the sub-array of W1 empty boxes. By applying the procedure repeatedly, we finally obtain sub-arrays of [formula] occupied boxes and those of [formula] empty boxes which are alternately arranged (see figure [\ref=fig:pBBS]). This is the initial state of the pBBS.

Time evolution [\eqref=eq:pbbs] can be realized by moving balls in the following manner. Make a copy of every ball in the initial state constructed above. Pick an arbitrary copy of ball and move it to the nearest empty box to the right. Repeat this procedure till every ball moves once, and then erase the original ones. Thus we obtain the second state consisting of [formula] empty boxes and [formula] occupied boxes each of which contains a ball. We find that the sub-array of occupied boxes starting from the left-most box in that of W1 empty boxes in the initial state has length 1. We also find that the sub-array of empty boxes adjoining that of 1 occupied boxes has length [formula]. We inductively find that the second state consists of sub-arrays of [formula] occupied boxes and those of [formula] empty boxes which are alternately arranged (see figure [\ref=fig:pBBSte]). Repeat this procedure t times then we obtain the t-th state of the balls corresponding to [formula].

Now we introduce the spectral curve of the UD-pTL. Let us consider the following tropical polynomial F in X and Y

[formula]

where [formula]. We can associate the coefficients [formula] in F with the variables [formula] and [formula] of the UD-pTL appropriately [\cite=MIT05] [\cite=IT08] [\cite=Nobe13], e.g.,

[formula]

Here we use the assumption ([\ref=eq:jwcond]). The correspondence defines a piecewise linear map

[formula]

We may use the notation [formula] for [formula] when the map ζ is iterated. One can show that the coefficients [formula] in F are the conserved quantities of the UD-pTL [\cite=MIT05] [\cite=IT08].

Consider the tropical plane curve Γ̃ defined by F [\cite=RGST03] [\cite=Gathmann06] [\cite=IMS07]:

[formula]

Assume C- 1 > 2C0, Cg - 1 > 2Cg, and Ci + Ci + 2 > 2Ci + 1 for [formula]. Then Γ̃ is a tropical hyperelliptic curve of genus g [\cite=MZ06] [\cite=HMY09]. By removing all half rays from Γ̃, we obtain the compact tropical curve denoted by Γ (see figure [\ref=fig:THC]). Hereafter, we consider Γ rather than Γ̃ as the spectral curve of the UD-pTL.

Consider the involution [formula]. We call [formula] the conjugate of P. Note that Γ is symmetric with respect to the line Y = C -  1  /  2. We denote the 2g + 2 vertices of Γ by Vi and [formula] for [formula]

[formula]

The cycle connecting Vi, Vi - 1, [formula], and [formula] in a counterclockwise direction is denoted by αi for [formula].

Addition on tropical hyperelliptic curves

We briefly review addition of points on tropical hyperelliptic curves [\cite=Vigeland04] [\cite=Nobe12].

Denote the divisor group of Γ by D(Γ). A rational function on Γ is a continuous function [formula] such that its restriction to any edge is piecewise linear with integral slope [\cite=Gathmann06]. The order of f at P∈Γ is the sum of the outgoing slopes of all segments emanating from P and is denoted by ordPf. If ordPf < 0 then P is called the zero of f of order [formula]. If ordPf > 0 then P is called the pole of f of order ordPf. The principal divisor (f) of f is defined to be [formula]. We then find [formula].

Define the Picard group of Γ to be the residue class group [formula], where D0(Γ) is the group of divisors of degree 0 on Γ and Dl(Γ) is the group of principal divisors of rational functions on Γ.

Define the canonical map Φ:D+g(Γ)  →  Pic0(Γ) to be

[formula]

where D+g(Γ) is the group of effective divisors of degree g on Γ and [formula] is a fixed element. We then have the following theorem.

The canonical map Φ is surjective. In particular, Φ is bijective if g = 1.

By using the surjection Φ, we induce an addition of points on the g-th symmetric product [formula] from Pic0(Γ). Put [formula], where [formula]. For dP,dQ∈Symg(Γ), we define [formula] to be an element in the subset

[formula]

Although [formula] is not uniquely determined on Symg(Γ), there exists a subset of Symg(Γ) on which the addition is uniquely determined.

Put [formula] for the cycles αi ([formula]). We define the subset [formula] of D+g(Γ) to be

[formula]

We then have the following theorem.

The reduced map [formula] is bijective.

Since μ|:  →  μ()  ⊂  Symg(Γ) is also bijective, the addition [formula] is uniquely determined. Thus we see that μ()≃Pic0(Γ) as a group.

Hereafter, we fix [formula] as follows

[formula]

Define the element o∈Symg(Γ) to be

[formula]

Then o is the unit of addition of the group μ() [\cite=Nobe12] [\cite=Nobe13].

Tropical eigenvector maps

Let the phase space of the UD-pTL be

[formula]

and the moduli space of Γ be [formula]. Consider the map ψ:T  →  C defined by ([\ref=eq:CJW]) and set

[formula]

The set TC is called the isospectral set of the UD-pTL.

Now remember the periodic discrete Toda lattice (pdTL) [formula] [formula] given by

[formula]

where we put [formula] and [formula] [\cite=HTI93]. By applying the procedure of ultradiscretization to the pdTL, we obtain the UD-pTL [\cite=YT02] [\cite=KT02]. Let [formula] be the eigenvector of the Lax matrix

[formula]

of the pdTL. Here - x is the eigenvalue of L and y is the spectral parameter.

Let [formula] be the polynomial [formula] in x and y. Then [formula] has the form

[formula]

and defines the spectral curve γ̃ of the pdTL, which is a hyperelliptic curve of genus g for appropriate choice of ci's [\cite=IT08]. Note that the coefficients [formula] are subtraction-free polynomials in [formula] and [formula] and are the conserved quantities of the pdTL.

Consider the eigenvalue equation of L

[formula]

Let the (i,j)-entry of L be lij. By applying the Cramer formula, each element of φ(x,y) is explicitly given by

[formula]

for [formula] and

[formula]

where LΛ̄ = (lij)1  ≤  i,j  ≤  g.

Let Uc be the isospectral set of the pdTL. The eigenvector map φ of the pdTL is defined to be a map [formula]

[formula]

where [formula] are points on γ̃ such that they are the common g zeros of the rational functions [formula] in the eigenvector φ(x,y) [\cite=vMM79] [\cite=Iwao08].

We can easily see that the first two entries φ1(x,y) and φ2(x,y) of φ(x,y) have exactly g zeros in common, and these g zeros define φ. Expand φ1(x,y) with respect to the first column:

[formula]

Also expand φ2(x,y) with respect to the second column:

[formula]

Now consider the following formula [\cite=Nobe13]:

[formula]

where we put

[formula]

for i  ≤  j, [formula]. It should be noted that [\eqref=eq:formulavarphigp1] is the subtraction-free polynomial φg + 1(x) in x, the (g + 1)-th entry of the eigenvector φ(x,y).

Setting I2 = V1 = 0 in [\eqref=eq:formulavarphigp1], we have

[formula]

where we use the fact [formula]. Moreover setting I3 = V2 = 0, we obtain

[formula]

where we use the fact [formula]. Thus we find the following explicit formulae for φ1 and φ2

[formula]

From the first equation in [\eqref=eq:sse] we have

[formula]

The remaining equations in [\eqref=eq:sse] imply

[formula]

for [formula] and

[formula]

Note that [\eqref=eq:phitildef] is equivalent to the defining polynomial (x,y) of γ̃.

Now we apply the procedure of ultradiscretization to φ1 and φ2. Replace x and - y with e- X / ε and e- Y / ε, respectively. Also replace Ii and Vi with e- Ji  /  ε and e- Wi  /  ε for [formula], respectively. Then the polynomials ( - 1)g - 1yφ1(x, - y) and ( - 1)gyφ2(x, - y) are subtraction-free and we obtain tropical polynomials

[formula]

and

[formula]

in the limit [formula]. Here Ci ([formula] is the coefficient in the defining polynomial F of Γ and we put

[formula]

for i  ≤  j, [formula].

Define tropical plane curves L1 and L2 by using these tropical polynomials:

[formula]

We may use the notation Gt1(X,Y),Gt2(X,Y) and Lt1,Lt2 for [formula] and [formula] for [formula].

By embedding these tropical curves into tropical projective plane [formula], we can prove that L1 intersects L2 exactly at g points [formula]. Moreover, by [\eqref=eq:phig12]-[\eqref=eq:phitildef], we find that the g intersection points [formula] of L1 and L2 are on Γ.

We define the tropical eigenvector map φ:TC  →  Picg(Γ): = D+g(Γ) / Dl(Γ) to be

[formula]

where [formula] are the intersection points of L1, L2 and Γ.

A geometric realization of UD-pTL

Define T∈D+g(Γ) to be

[formula]

for [formula]. Here [formula] is the unique point such that B + V1 - 2V0 is the principal divisor of a rational function on Γ. For g = 1, we define T to be the point (C1,C0)∈ on the edge [formula].

We easily observe that T∈. Moreover, we obtain the following theorem concerning time evolution of the UD-pTL and an addition on Symg(Γ).

Set τ  =  μ(T)∈Symg(Γ). Then, for any g, the following diagram is commutative

[formula]

Let [formula] be the points on Γ given by the tropical eigenvector map φ. Also let dP  =  μ(DP) for [formula]. Then the addition of points on Symg(Γ) in theorem [\ref=thm:tepBBSonSymg] is written as

[formula]

Since [formula] (mod Dl(Γ)) for any g, ([\ref=eq:addtropsym]) is written by the divisors on Pic0(Γ):

[formula]

where [formula]. Hereafter, we assume that the divisor [formula] is in [formula].

Let M be a number such that [formula]. Define SjCi and TkCi for [formula] and [formula] to be

[formula]

Note that SjCi eliminates the terms in Ci not containing Jj and TkCi the terms in Ci containing Wk.

Define tropical polynomials

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] for [formula].

By using H1 and H2, we define the tropical curves K1 and K2, respectively

[formula]

These tropical plane curves are tropical analogues of the plane curves which intersect the spectral curve γ̃ of the pdTL and give the time evolution of the pdTL [\cite=Nobe13]. We may use the notation Ht1(X,Y),Ht2(X,Y) and Kt1,Kt2 for [formula] and [formula] for [formula].

Denote the restriction of the rational function H1 on Γ by H1|Γ. We then have the following proposition.

Assume that the points [formula] are on the tropical curve K1. Then the rational function H1|Γ on Γ satisfies

[formula]

Thus we see that the addition [\eqref=eq:addtroppic] is realized by using the intersection of Γ and K1 defined by H1, and hence [formula] are the intersection points of Γ and K1. Moreover, if g is an even number we have (see [\cite=Nobe12])

[formula]

for [formula]. This implies [formula]. Thus the time evolution of the UD-pTL is realized by using the intersection of tropical plane curves Γ and K1 if g is an even number.

Now assume that g is an odd number. The restriction H2|Γ of rational function H2 on Γ has poles of oder g at V0 and [formula]. This implies

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are the intersection points of Γ and K2 defined by H2. There uniquely exists a point Z0 on [formula] such that

[formula]

We then find

[formula]

Since there exists at least one intersection point of Γ and K1 on the upper half of [formula], we can assume that Q1 is the one. Then there exist rational functions G1 and G2 on Γ such that

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

It immediately follows

[formula]

Comparing [\eqref=eq:addtroppic2] with [\eqref=eq:H2pd], we find

[formula]

Remember that [formula] are the intersection points of Γ and K1, and Z1 is the unique point on Γ determined by the intersection points [formula] of Γ and K2 by the formula

[formula]

Thus the time evolution of the UD-pTL is realized by using the intersection of the tropical plane curves Γ, K1 and K2 if g is an odd number. We obtain the following theorem.

Let DP and DQ be elements of [formula] satisfying ([\ref=eq:addtroppic]). Also let T be the element of [formula] given by ([\ref=eq:tepBBS]). Put dP  =  μ(DP)∈Symg(Γ) and τ  =  μ(T)∈Symg(Γ). Then the element [formula] defined by the addition

[formula]

is explicitly given by the formula

[formula]

In appendix [\ref=sec:example], we give an explicit computation of the time evolution of the pBBS imposing a certain initial condition on the integral lattice via tropical curve intersection.

Conclusion

We establish a geometric realization of the UD-pTL via the tropical curve intersection of its spectral curve Γ and two plane curves K1 and K2. Namely, the linear flow on the tropical Jacobian of Γ equivalent to the time evolution of the UD-pTL is translated into the intersection of tropical curves Γ, K1 and K2. The rational functions F, H1 and H2 which respectively define Γ, K1 and K2 are explicitly given by using the conserved quantities [formula] of the UD-pTL. Moreover, the tropical eigenvector map, which maps a point in the isospectral set TC of the UD-pTL into a set of points on Γ, is explicitly given by using two tropical plane curves L1 and L2. The rational functions G1 and G2 which respectively define these tropical plane curves are also given by using the conserved quantities of the UD-pTL. Thus, if initial values of the UD-pTL are given then we can completely realize the time evolution of the UD-pTL via tropical plane curves Γ, L1, L2, K1 and K2. We observe that the points [formula] on Γ corresponding to the variables [formula] of the UD-pTL move the cycles [formula] in Γ in a counterclockwise direction as t increasing, respectively.

The pBBS studied in this article is a fundamental ultradiscrete integrable system and is associated with the crystal basis of the quantum group Uq(2) [\cite=HHIKTT01]. To establish geometric realizations for members in a wide class of ultradiscrete integrable systems such as box-ball systems associated with the crystal bases of the quantum groups Uq() of affine Lie algebras [formula] other than 2 is a further problem.

An example of geometric realization of pBBS

In this section, we show explicit computation of the tropical geometric realization of the UD-pTL discussed above. In particular, we consider the pBBS case, that is, we take the initial values in positive integers. Throughout this section, we fix g = 2.

Let us consider the following initial values of the pBBS

[formula]

The time evolution of the pBBS imposing this initial condition from t = 1 to 4 is computed as follows

[formula]

The realization of the pBBS with boxes and balls is illustrated in figure [\ref=fig:pBBSex].

The spectral curve Γ of the pBBS is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

Substituting the initial values [\eqref=eq:ivpBBS] into the coefficients C- 1,C0,C1,C2, we obtain

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Figure [\ref=fig:evmt0] shows the spectral curve Γ̃ given by [\eqref=eq:Fexample], which is a tropical hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. The vertices in Γ̃ are as follows

[formula]

The tropical plane curves L1 and L2 which define the tropical eigenvector map are given by the tropical polynomials

[formula]

where we use

[formula]

For the initial values [\eqref=eq:ivpBBS], we obtain

[formula]

Figure [\ref=fig:evmt0] shows Γ, L01 and L02 and their intersection points P01 = (1,9) and P02 = (2,7). By applying the eigenvector map repeatedly, we obtain the sequence

[formula]

of points on Γ corresponding to the sequence [formula] (see figure [\ref=fig:k1total]). We observe that the points Pt1 and Pt2 move the cycles α1 and α2 in a contourclockwise direction as t increasing, respectively.

Now consider time evolution of the pBBS. The tropical curve K1 is given by the tropical polynomial

[formula]

where

[formula]

For the initial values [\eqref=eq:ivpBBS], we obtain

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Since we fix g = 2, we do not need the second curve K2 given by H2 to realize the time evolution of the pBBS.

Figure [\ref=fig:k1t0] shows the intersection of K01 and Γ. The conjugates [formula] and [formula] of the new intersection points Q01 and Q02 are P11 and P12, and these points correspond to [formula] and [formula] through the eigenvector map φ. Figures [\ref=fig:k1t1] - [\ref=fig:k1t3] show the intersection of Γ and Kt1 equivalent to the time evolution of the pBBS for t = 1,2,3.

To obtain the intersection points concretely, we use the notion of stable intersection [\cite=Vigeland04] and rational functions on Γ. For example, in figure [\ref=fig:k1t0], we see that Γ intersects K01 at 5 vertices ([formula] and U0,U1∈K01) in the sense of stable intersection. This fact suggests [formula] (mod Dl(Γ)) (see [\eqref=eq:addtroppic]). We easily find that there exists a rational function on Γ whose principal divisor is P01 + P02 + Q01 + Q02 - V0 - V1 - U0 - U1. This implies

[formula]

Thus the intersection points of Γ and K01 are P01, P02, Q01, Q02 and [formula].
