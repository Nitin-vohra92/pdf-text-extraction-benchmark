Lemma

local conformal rigidity in codimension ≤   5

Introduction

Let Mn be an n-dimensional differentiable manifold and let [formula] and [formula] be two immersions into Euclidean spaces. We say that   g   is conformal to   f   when the metric induced on   Mn   by   f   and   g   are conformal. That f is conformally rigid means that for any other conformal immersion [formula], conformal to f, there exists a conformal diffeomorphism   Υ   from an open subset of [formula] to an open subset of [formula] such that [formula].

In [\cite=C-D], do Carmo and Dajczer introduced a conformal invariant for an immersion f:  Mn  →  n + d into a Riemannian manifold n + d, namely, the conformal s-nullity νcs(p), p∈Mn, 1  ≤  s  ≤  d(see Section 2 for definitions), and proved that is conformally rigid an immersion [formula] that satisfies   d  ≤  4  ,   n  ≥  2d + 3 and   νcs  ≤  n - 2s - 1  for   1  ≤  s  ≤  d. Their result generalizes a result for hypersurfaces due to E. Cartan ([\cite=Ca]). It was observed in Corollary 1.1 of [\cite=Si] that the do Carmo-Dajczer's conformal rigidity result also holds for d = 5. The restriction on the codimension is due to the following basic result in [\cite=C-D]

Let σ:  V1  ×  V1  →  W(r,r) be a nonzero flat symmetric bilinear form. Assume   r  ≤  5   and   N(σ) <   V1 - 2r. Then   S(σ)   is degenerate.

In the paper(see [\cite=D-F]), M. Dajczer and L. Florit proved that the above theorem can not be improved.

Denoting by Nn + dcf a conformally flat Riemannian manifold of dimension n + d, namely an (n + d)-dimensional Riemannian manifold Nn + d which is locally conformally diffeomorphic to an open subset of Euclidean space [formula] with the canonical metric, Dajczer and Vergasta([\cite=D-V]) proved that if f:  Mn  →  Nn + 1cf satisfies n  ≥  6 and νc1  ≤  n - 4 along Mn, then any immersion g:  Mn  →  Nn + 2cf conformal to f is locally a composition in an open dense subset U of M. This result, still in the context of hypersurfaces, was extended by Dajczer-Tojeiro in [\cite=D-T] for g:  Mn  →  Nn + pcf, 2  ≤  p  ≤  n - 4, assuming that νc1  ≤  n - p - 2 and, if p  ≥  6, further that Mn does not contain an open n - p + 2-conformally ruled subset for both f and g. In this paper, we extend for codimension ≤  5 the result of Dajczer-Vergasta mentioned above in the following theorems.

Let [formula] be an immersion with d  ≤  5 and   n  >  2d + 3. Assume that everywhere   νcs  ≤  n - 2s - 2, 1  ≤  s  ≤  d. If [formula] is an immersion conformal to f, then there exists an open dense subset U of Mn such that g restricted to U is locally a composition [formula] for some local conformal immersion Γ from an open subset of [formula] into an open subset of [formula].

Observing that Theorem 1.2 is local one, the following result is an immediate consequence of Theorem 1.2.

Let f  :Mn  →  Nn + dcf be an immersion with d  ≤  5 and   n  >  2d + 3. Assume that everywhere   νcs  ≤  n - 2s - 2, 1  ≤  s  ≤  d. If g:  Mn  →  Nn + d + 1cf is an immersion conformal to f, then there exists an open dense subset U of Mn such that g restricted to U is locally a composition [formula] for some local conformal immersion Γ from an open subset of Nn + dcf into an open subset of Nn + d + 1cf.

Proof of Theorem 1.2

For a symmetric bilinear form β:  V  ×  V  →  W we denote by   S(β)   the subspace of   W   given by

[formula]

and by   N(β)   the nullity space of   β   defined as

[formula]

For an immersion f:  Mn  →  n + d into a Riemannian manifold we denote by [formula] its vector valued second fundamental form and by [formula] the normal space of f at p∈Mn. Given an   s-dimensional subspace [formula] 1  ≤  s  ≤  d, consider the symmetric bilinear form

[formula]

defined as [formula] where   P   denotes the orthogonal projection of [formula] onto   Us. The conformal   s-nullity   νcs(p)   of   f   at   p, 1  ≤  s  ≤  d, is the integer

[formula]

The Lorentz space   I  Lk,  k  ≥  2, is the Euclidean space [formula] endowed with the metric   〈    ,    〉   defined by

[formula]

for [formula] The light cone   Vk - 1   is the degenerate totally umbilical hypersurface of   I  Lk   given by

[formula]

For k  ≥  3 and   ζ∈Vk - 1   consider the hyperplane

[formula]

and the   (k - 2)-dimensional simply connected embedded submanifold [formula] Note that Hζ intersects only one of the two connected components of Vk - 1. More precisely,   Hζ is in the Euclidean sense parallel to ζ and it does not pass through the origin. Given [formula] the normal space of this intersection in   I  Lk   is the Lorentzian plane   I  L2   generated by   p   and   ζ. Consequently, the metric induced by   I  Lk   on [formula] is Riemannian. Its second fundamental form is given by

[formula]

The Gauss equation for the inclusion [formula] shows that [formula] is flat and, consequently, is the image of an isometric embedding [formula].

Now suppose that Mn is a Riemannian manifold and [formula] is a conformal immersion with conformal factor φh, that is, [formula] over Mn, where X,  Y are vectors tangent to Mn and φh is a positive differentiable real function on Mn. We associate to   h   the isometric immersion H:  Mn  →  Vk - 1  ⊂  I  Lk   by setting

[formula]

for a chosen   ζ∈Vk - 1.

Consider Mn with the metric induced by f, a fixed   ζ in Vn + d + 1 and an isometric embedding [formula]. The isometric immersion F:  Mn  →  Vn + d + 1  ⊂  I  Ln + d + 2   associated to f is given by

[formula]

Its second fundamental form in I  Ln + d + 2 is the symmetric bilinear form

[formula]

Here, we are identifying the second fundamental form αf of f in [formula] with the symmetric bilinear form [formula]

Now let [formula] be an immersion conformal to f. Consider the isometric immersion G:  Mn  →  Vn + d + 2  ⊂  I  Ln + d + 3 given by

[formula]

for an fixed [formula] in Vn + d + 2, where [formula] is an isometric embedding. Taking the derivative of   〈G,G〉 = 0, we see that the null vector field   G   is normal to the immersion   G. The normal field   G   also satisfies   AGG =  - I. The normal bundle of   G   is given by the orthogonal direct sum

[formula]

where [formula] is identified with [formula] and   I  L2   is a Lorentzian plane bundle that contains   G. There exists an unique orthogonal basis   {ξ,η}   of   I  L2, satisfying   |ξ|2 =  - 1,   |η|2 = 1 and

[formula]

Writing   αG   in terms of this orthogonal frame we obtain

[formula]

where [formula] is the [formula]-component of   αG.

Given an   m-dimensional real vector space   W   endowed with a nondegenerate inner product   〈    ,    〉   of index   r, that is, the maximal dimension of a subspace of   W   where   〈    ,    〉   is negative definite, we say that   W   is of type   (r,q)   and we write   W(r,q)   with   q = m - r.

At   p∈Mn, let

[formula]

be endowed with the natural metric of type   (d + 1,d + 2)   which is negative definite on [formula] We also define the symmetric tensor β:  TM  ×  TM  →  W setting   β  =  αf  +  αG  , that is,

[formula]

The Gauss equations for   f   and   G   imply that   β   is flat, that is,

[formula]

Observe also that   β(X,X)  ≠  0   for all   X  ≠  0, because   AGξ  +  η =  - I.

With the aim of constructing locally the conformal immersion Γ we construct locally an isometric immersion T of a neighborhood of Ln + d + 2 into a neighborhood of Ln + d + 3 such that [formula] This   T   induces a conformal immersion Γ from an open subset of [formula] into an open subset of [formula] defined by

[formula]

which satisfies [formula]. Now we will construct locally the isometric immersion T.

Given p∈Mn, there exist an orthonormal basis [formula] of [formula] and a basis [formula], μd + 1 of [formula] with   〈G,μo〉  =  1,  〈μo,μo〉 = 0,   〈μo,μj〉 = 0 = 〈G,μj〉,   〈μi,μj〉  =  δij, 1  ≤  i,  j  ≤  d + 1, such that

[formula]

with   AGμd + 1  ≤  1. Here, [formula] is the inner product induced in [formula] by [formula].

With respect to flat symmetric bilinear forms we need the following from [\cite=Da]:

For p∈Mn, set   V: = TpM   and for each   X∈  V   define the linear map

[formula]

by setting   β(X)(v) = β(X,v)   for all   v∈V. The kernel and image of   β(X)   are denoted by     β(X)   and   β(X,V), respectively. We say that   X   is a regular element of   β   if

[formula]

The set of regular elements of   β   is denoted by   RE(β). For each X∈V, set [formula] and define

[formula]

where d0  =   min {    U(Y)  :  Y∈RE(β)}.

The set   RE*(β)   is open and dense in   V   and

[formula]

Recall that a vector subspace   L   of   W   is said to be degenerate if [formula] and isotropic when   〈L,L〉 = 0. We also have that

[formula]

Notice that L is an isotropic subspace of W if and only if [formula] In this case, it follows easily from ([\ref=4]) that L has dimension at most d + 1. Recall that Wp is a (2d + 3)-dimensional vector space. Since U(X) is isotropic by definition, we have that d0  ≤  d + 1.

Before proving Lemma 2.1 we need several lemmas:

In an arbitrary p∈Mn it holds that [formula]

First we prove the following assertion

Assertion. There exist an orthogonal decomposition

[formula]

and symmetric bilinear forms ωj:  V  ×  V  →  Wj, j = 1,  2, satisfying

[formula]

such that:

i)   ω1   is nonzero and null with respect to   〈    ,    〉,   that is,

[formula]

and

ii)   ω2   is flat with [formula]

Notice that   β(Z,Z)  ≠  0   for all Z  ≠  0 in TM. Given   X∈RE(β), there exists   Z  ≠  0   such that   Z∈  β(X) due to   n > 2d + 3. Since   β   is flat,   β(Z,V)  ⊂  U(X) by Lemma 2.2 and   U(X)   is isotropic, it holds that [formula] Let [formula] with [formula] and [formula] be a basis of the isotropic subspace [formula] The vectors [formula] are linearly independent. Otherwise, there are real numbers ρi, with some of them different of zero, such that [formula] Since the vectors [formula] are linearly independent, we have [formula] The metric in [formula] being positive definite, we have obtained a contradiction because the vector [formula] is not isotropic. Analogously, we obtain that the vectors [formula] are linearly independent. Without loss of generality, we can suppose that the vectors [formula] are orthonormal. In this case, due to 〈υi,υj〉 = 0, [formula] we have 〈ξi,ξj〉 =  - δij for [formula] Extend [formula] to an orthonormal basis [formula] of [formula] and [formula] to a basis [formula] of [formula] that satisfies 〈ξi,ξj〉 =  - δij. Define [formula]

[formula]

and put

[formula]

Note that [formula] is an orthogonal decomposition of W. For [formula] we have [formula]. Set

[formula]

Since [formula] then   ω1   is nonzero. It is easy to verify that   ω1,ω2   are symmetric bilinear forms such that   ω1   is null and   ω2   is flat. In order to see that   S(ω2)   is nondegenerate, let [formula] be an arbitrary element in [formula] For all   v,w∈V, we get

[formula]

Therefore, [formula] Hence, [formula] Thus,

[formula]

Since the subspace   S(ω2)   is nondegenerate and [formula] the inequality     N(ω2)  ≥  n -   W2   is a consequence of the following result whose proof is part of the arguments for the Main Lemma 2.2 in ([\cite=C-D], pp. 968-974).

Let σ:  V1  ×  V1  →  W(r,t) be a nonzero flat symmetric bilinear form. Assume   r  ≤  5   and   N(σ) <   V1 - (r + t). Then   S(σ)   is degenerate.

Now to conclude Lemma 2.3, that is [formula] we proceed exactly as in proof of Assertion 3 in ([\cite=Si], p. 238).

There exist an orthonormal basis [formula] of [formula] and an orthonormal basis [formula] of [formula] such that

[formula]

Here our notations are as in proof of Assertion. We have W2  =  {ηd + 2} due to [formula]. Put ηd + 2  =  η cos θ  +  ϑd + 1 sin θ. The vector -  η sin θ  +  ϑd + 1 cos θ belongs to {ηi  :  1  ≤  i  ≤  d + 1} and its orthogonal complement in {ηi  :  1  ≤  i  ≤  d + 1} is the orthogonal complement of ϑd + 1 in [formula] The vectors ξi  =  γi + biξ,  1  ≤  i  ≤  d + 1, being linearly independent, span the space [formula] Write [formula] and take the vector in [formula] given by

[formula]

where [formula] is an unitary vector orthogonal to ϑd + 1. The vector -   sin φ  ( - η sin θ  +  ϑd + 1 cos θ) + ϑ1 cos φ also belongs to {ηi  :  1  ≤  i  ≤  d + 1} since it is orthogonal to ηd + 2. Take ζ1 as being the unitary vector in [formula] such that

[formula]

Now extend ζ1 to an orthonormal basis [formula] of [formula] and take the vectors [formula] in [formula] such that ζi  +  ϑi,  2  ≤  i  ≤  d, belong to [formula] Now it is not difficult to see that [formula] is an orthonormal basis of [formula] and satisfies ([\ref=5]).

Note also that in ([\ref=5]) the form ω1 is a linear combination of vectors orthogonal to [formula] These orthogonality give us

[formula]

The above first two equations imply that

[formula]

First observe that in ([\ref=5]) we have sin θ   cos φ  ≠   - 1. Otherwise, G = ξ  +  η belongs to [formula] and, consequently,

[formula]

which is a contradiction. Then, we can consider the orthonormal basis of [formula] given by

[formula]

By ([\ref=6]), for 2  ≤  j  ≤  d, it holds that

[formula]

Thus, we can write

[formula]

The equalities in ([\ref=5]) give that

[formula]

and, jointly with -  〈  ,  〉  =  〈G,αG〉  =  〈ξ  +  η,β〉  =  〈ξ  +  η,ω1  +  ω2〉, that

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

From ([\ref=6]) and AGξ  +  η =  - I, we deduce that

[formula]

So

[formula]

Multiplying the above equation by cos φ  +   sin θ and introducing [formula] according to ([\ref=8]), it is a straightforward calculation to see that

[formula]

This and ([\ref=7]) imply

[formula]

The formulae ([\ref=9]), ([\ref=11]) e ([\ref=12]) give us

[formula]

From which it is not difficult to see that

[formula]

Now ([\ref=3]) follows if we define

[formula]

Notice that if v∈V and w∈N(ω2), then

[formula]

due to ([\ref=5]), ([\ref=8]) and ([\ref=10]). Thus,   AGμd + 1  ≤  1. Recall that   N(ω2)  ≥  n - 1 by Assertion in proof of Lemma 2.3 and [formula].

We point out that p in Lemma 2.1 being arbitrary the decomposition ([\ref=3]) holds on Mn.

At p∈Mn, it holds that [formula]. Furthermore, [formula] at p if and only if [formula] at p and [formula] at p if and only if   AGμd + 1 = 1 at p.

Consider [formula] the orthogonal complement of [formula] in the nondegenerate (d + 3)-dimensional vector space

[formula]

Note that the coordinates of an arbitrary vector [formula] on the basis [formula] are given by

[formula]

Now take [formula] Then, for all v,  w∈V, we have

[formula]

due to ([\ref=3]). For [formula] we obtain

[formula]

So

[formula]

which contradicts the hypothesis on the 1-conformal nullity of f case [formula] Then 〈μi,μ〉 = 0,  1  ≤  i  ≤  d, and consequently 〈μo,μ〉  =  0. Thus, μ belongs to {μo,μd + 1} due to ([\ref=13]). From ([\ref=14]) we deduce that [formula] if and only if [formula] Since [formula] and   AGμd + 1  ≤  1 we have proved Lemma 2.6.

As a consequence of Lemma 2.6, if we define

[formula]

we have   S(ω) = d + 1, that is,

[formula]

In relation to S(ω) we also claim that

[formula]

In fact, if we put R =   {  ω(X,Y)  :  X,Y∈  AGμd + 1  }, it suffices to verify that   R = d + 1. For to see this we show that the orthogonal complement of R in the nondegenerate (d + 2)-dimensional vector space [formula] has dimension one. Let [formula] be an arbitrary vector orthogonal to R. Then, for all X,Y∈  AGμd + 1, we can write

[formula]

Consequently, if [formula] then the nullity of [formula] is at least n - 2. This implies that νc1  ≥  n - 2 and we have obtained a contradiction with our hypothesis. Thus, a = 0 = aj,  1  ≤  j  ≤  d, and the claim have been proved.

Let U be the subset of Mn constituted of the points q so that [formula] is constant in a neighborhood of q. The subset U is open and dense in Mn. In fact, clearly U is open in Mn. For to see that U is dense in Mn, consider an arbitrary point p in Mn. By Lemma 2.6, in each point p of Mn, the dimension of [formula] is either d + 1 or d + 2. If [formula] at p, then p belongs to U since [formula] does not decrease in a neighborhood of p by continuity. If [formula] at p and p does not belong to U, there is a sequence of points where [formula] is d + 2, consequently a sequence of points in U, that converges to p. Thus, U is dense in Mn. Now, for an arbitrary point p∈U, we consider a connected neighborhood U  ⊂  U of p where F is an embedding and [formula] is constant. We divide the proof of Theorem 1.2 in two cases.

Case I. [formula] on U. In this case, [formula] on U by Lemma 2.6 and

[formula]

due to ([\ref=3])

In Case I we can choose μd + 1 such that the unitary vector field [formula] be smooth on U.

In each point of U we choose μd + 1 so that the unique nonzero eigenvalue of AGμd + 1 be positive. We affirm that with this choice μd + 1 is smooth. First we prove that for all continuous tangent vector fields X,Y∈TU the function 〈αG(X,Y),μd + 1〉 is continuous. Since αG is bilinear and symmetric it suffices to prove that 〈αG(X,X),μd + 1〉 is continuous for all continuous field X in TU. All eigenvalues of AGμd + 1 being nonnegative, it holds that

[formula]

From ([\ref=3]) it follows that

[formula]

Recall that μo has zero length. In particular, [formula] is continuous. So [formula] is continuous due to ([\ref=17]). (Note that [formula] is smooth when Z and W are smooth.) Now in a fixed qo∈U consider an orthonormal basis [formula] of TqoM of eigenvectors of AGμd + 1 so that AGμd + 1e1  =  ρe1,  ρ > 0, and AGμd + 1ej = 0,  2  ≤  j  ≤  n. Extend [formula] locally to a smooth orthonormal frame [formula] of tangent vectors and define the local smooth fields Y1 = E1 and Yj = E1 + Ej,  2  ≤  j  ≤  n. Observe that in each point q where the vectors [formula] are defined they are linearly independent and so they are a basis of TqM. Since [formula] on U we can take vectors αG(Yik,Yjk),  1  ≤  k  ≤  d + 2, that are a basis of [formula] in a neighborhood of qo. Consider the locally defined continuous functions

[formula]

As we have seen above the functions ψk are continuous. We claim that each ψk is smooth. In fact, at qo we have ψk(qo) = ρ > 0. Then in a neighborhood of qo we can suppose that ψk is positive since it is continuous. We have observed previously that ψ2k is smooth. Therefore, ψk is smooth since it is positive. Let us denote [formula] the coordinates functions of μd + 1 on the basis αG(Yik,Yjk),  1  ≤  k  ≤  d + 2. Using ([\ref=3]), we can write

[formula]

So the functions ak satisfy the equations

[formula]

Taking a smooth orthonormal frame [formula] of [formula] in a neighborhood of qo, we have that the functions ak satisfy the following system of d + 2 linear equations

[formula]

The order d + 2 matrix of the system is an invertible smooth matrix. That it is smooth follows from the smoothly of the functions Yl,  αf and ψk for all [formula] and [formula] If we consider a vector [formula] in the kernel of the system, then the equations bellow are satisfied

[formula]

By ([\ref=3]), we deduce that [formula] Being the vectors αG(Yik,Yjk), 1  ≤  k  ≤  d + 2, linearly independent, we have ck = 0 for all k. So the matrix of the system is invertible. Then, the functions ak are smooth and, consequently, μd + 1 is an unitary smooth vector field on [formula]

The null vector field μo is smooth on U.

The proof is identical to one in Lemma 2.7, noticing that the coordinates [formula] of μo on the basis αG(Yik,Yjk),  1  ≤  k  ≤  d + 2, are determined by

[formula]

On U the null vector field μo is parallel along   AGμd + 1.

We denote by [formula] the connection of the Lorentz space I  Ln + d + 3 and by [formula] the normal connection of the immersion G. First note that the coordinate of [formula] in the direction μo is zero for all X∈TU. In fact, we have [formula] since XG = G*X is tangent. Now if we take derivatives on 〈G,μo〉 = 1 in the direction X, we obtain that [formula] and the coordinate of [formula] in the direction μo is zero by ([\ref=13]). Being μo a vector field of zero length, the vector [formula] has not component in the direction G by ([\ref=13]). Now we claim that [formula] also has not component on [formula] In fact, consider q∈U and the linear map

[formula]

Using the Codazzi's equations for αG, the compatibility of the normal connection of the immersion G with the metric in [formula] and that [formula] it is a straightforward calculation to see that

[formula]

This equation is equivalent to

[formula]

Let ΨL be the component of Ψ on [formula] that is,

[formula]

Suppose that [formula] and r  ≥  1. Consider a basis [formula] of [formula] Observe that [formula] Taking [formula] and using ([\ref=3]) and ([\ref=18]), we obtain that

[formula]

being E an unitary eigenvector such that AGμd + 1E = ρ  E, X∈TqM and j,  1  ≤  j  ≤  r. For each j,  1  ≤  j  ≤  r, consider the linear map ψj  :TqM  →    {E} given by

[formula]

Notice that if [formula] then [formula] due to ([\ref=20]). We have [formula] Then, for the r-dimensional space [formula] using the formula

[formula]

valid for any two finite dimensional vector subspaces of any vector space, we obtain

[formula]

which is in contradiction with our hypothesis on the r-conformal nullity. Then, r = 0 and [formula] for all Z∈TqM. Now from ([\ref=19]) we deduce that

[formula]

for all X,  Z∈TqM. Thus, if we choose X = E and Z∈  AGμd + 1, we have

[formula]

for all Z∈  AGμd + 1. Hence [formula] for all Z∈  AGμd + 1. Recall that our choice for μd + 1 is so that the unique nonzero eigenvalue ρ of the smooth linear map AGμd + 1 is positive.

On U the unitary vector field μd + 1 is parallel along   AGμd + 1.

Notice that the coordinate of [formula] in the direction μo is zero due to

[formula]

By Lemma 2.9, for X∈  AGμd + 1, [formula] also has not component in the direction G since [formula] Being μd + 1 an unitary vector field, the vector [formula] has not component in the direction μd + 1. Thus, we only need proving that [formula] also has not component on [formula] for all X∈  AGμd + 1. Consider the linear map

[formula]

Our choice for μd + 1 so that the unique nonzero eigenvalue ρ of the smooth linear map AGμd + 1 is positive, for a well known argument, implies that ρ is smooth. Simple calculations shows that in an arbitrary point of U the (n - 1)-dimensional distribution   AGμd + 1 is given by

[formula]

So   AGμd + 1 is a differentiable distribution on U. Therefore, if in some point qo of U we consider X∈  AGμd + 1, we can take in a neighborhood of qo in U a differentiable extension of X that lies on   AGμd + 1. With these observations, using the Codazzi's equations for αG and the compatibility of the normal connection of the immersion G with the metric in [formula] it is a straightforward calculation to see that

[formula]

Suppose that [formula] and r  ≥  1. At this point we proceed like in proof of Lemma 2.9, with   AGμd + 1 instead of TqM, for deduce that [formula] and Lemma 2.10 has been proved.

Now we consider the linear isometry [formula] given by

[formula]

Notice that τ is smooth since

[formula]

and [formula], [formula], due to ([\ref=1]) and ([\ref=15]). Observe also that our hypothesis on the 1-conformal nullity of f implies that [formula] is a (d + 1)-dimensional subspace of [formula].

Since the (n - 1)-dimensional distribution   AGμd + 1 is smooth on U, if E is an unitary differentiable vector field orthogonal to   AGμd + 1 then E is in each point an eigenvector of AGμd + 1 corresponding to the eigenvalue ρ. Consequently, E can be chosen smooth on U. Consider the vector bundle isometry [formula] defined as T(δ + cE) = τ(δ) + cE for all [formula] Take the subbundle [formula] whose bundles are the orthogonal complement of the subspace generated by [formula] We observe that, being [formula] a (d + 3)-dimensional nondegenerate vector bundle, Λ is a (d + 2)-dimensional nondegenerate subbundle and that Λ is transversal to TU. Now define the (d + 2)-dimensional nondegenerate subbundle Ω of [formula] transversal to TU, by setting T(Ω) = Λ. Let F:  Ω  →  I  Ln + d + 2 be defined by F(q,ϑ) = F(q) + ϑ for all q∈U and all ϑ in the fibre Ωq. Since the fibres of Ω are transversal to TU and F is an embedding on U, F is a diffeomorphism from a neighborhood Ω0 of the zero section in Ω into a neighborhood W of F(U) in I  Ln + d + 2. Consider Ω0 endowed with the flat metric induced by F. Restrict to Ω0, F become an isometry onto W. From now on F will stand for this restriction. Now let G:  Ω0  →  I  Ln + d + 3 be defined by G(q,ϑ) = G(q) + T(ϑ) for all q∈U and ϑ∈Ωq. We claim that G is an isometric immersion. In fact, for all differentiable curve θ(t) = (γ(t),δ(γ(t)) + c(t)E(γ(t)))∈Ω0 we have G(θ(t)) = G(γ(t)) + τ(δ(γ(t))) + c(t)E(γ(t)). Consequently,

[formula]

Now if we put [formula] being v the component of [formula] in   AGμd + 1, we have

[formula]

Recall that τ(δ)  +  cE∈Λ is orthogonal to Eμd + 1 and that, by Lemma 2.10, [formula] For to finish the proof of the claim we will need of the following

For X∈TU and [formula] let [formula] be given by [formula] being [formula] the normal connection of the immersion F, and let Xμ be the component of [formula] on L. Then, it holds that [formula]

For a fixed X∈TU, we define the linear map K(X)  :L  →  L by [formula] Since L is nondegenerate, for to prove that [formula] it suffices to prove, for all W,  V,  Y,  Z∈  AGμd + 1, the following relations

[formula]

due to ([\ref=16]) and ([\ref=21]). First we note that K(X)G = 0 because [formula] Also, for all Y,  Z∈  AGμd + 1, we have

[formula]

Now we verify that holds the relation

[formula]

In fact, for all μ∈L, we have

[formula]

Above we have used that [formula] αG(X,Z) = ω(X,Z), for any X∈TM, Z∈  AGμd + 1 and that αF and αG satisfy the Codazzi's equations. It is a straightforward calculation to see that K(X) satisfies

[formula]

Now if W,  V,  Y,  Z∈  AGμd + 1 and X is an arbitrary tangent vector, then

[formula]

Therefore, Lemma 2.11 has been proved.

Now, due to ([\ref=23]), the equality ([\ref=22]) becomes

[formula]

Observe that AGτ(δ) = AFδ. Then, [formula] for all differentiable curve θ(t) in Ω. This finish the proof of the claim.

Finally, taking [formula] we obtain an isometric immersion from a neighborhood of F(U) in I  Ln + d + 2 into a neighborhood of G(U) in I  Ln + d + 3 such that

[formula]

According to previous observations T induces a conformal immersion Γ from a neighborhood of f(U) in [formula] into a neighborhood of g(U) in [formula] such that [formula] This prove Theorem 1.2 in Case I.

Case II. [formula] on U. In this case, by Lemma 2.6, [formula] on U and,consequently,

[formula]

by ([\ref=3]).

The linear isometry [formula] given by

[formula]

now satisfies [formula] Thus, τ is smooth. Then μo also is smooth. Since   {μd + 1} is the orthogonal complement of [formula] in [formula] the unitary vector field μd + 1 can be choose smooth. Define

[formula]

Using the Codazzi's equations for αG, the compatibility of the normal connection of the immersion G with the metric in [formula] and that [formula] it is not difficult to see that

[formula]

that is,

[formula]

At q∈U, let us denote S the subspace of [formula] given by

[formula]

Suppose that   S = r and r  ≥  1. Take a basis of S given by [formula] 1  ≤  j  ≤  r. It holds that [formula] From ([\ref=3]) and ([\ref=24]) we deduce that

[formula]

for all q∈U, X∈TqM and j,  1  ≤  j  ≤  r. Define γ∈S by [formula] 1  ≤  j  ≤  r. If [formula] then [formula] due to ([\ref=26]). Thus,

[formula]

which is in contradiction with our hypothesis on the r-conformal nullity. Then r = 0 and [formula] for all q∈U and Z∈TqM by ([\ref=13]). From ([\ref=25]) and AGG =  - I, we deduce that

[formula]

Since n  ≥  2, this implies that [formula] for all q∈U and Z∈TqM. Hence [formula] and the unitary vector field μd + 1 is parallel along U. Then L, the orthogonal complement of   {μd + 1} in [formula] is a (d + 2)-dimensional nondegenerate parallel subbundle of [formula] that is, [formula] for all X∈TU and μ∈L. We claim that μd + 1 is constant along U. In fact, for all X∈TU we have

[formula]

We fix q∈U and consider a differentiable curve γ(t) in U with γ(0) = q. Then, putting μd + 1(q) = μ, we have

[formula]

Therefore, 〈G(γ(t)) - G(q),μ〉 is constant and equal to zero. So G(γ(t)) lies on the (n + d + 2)-dimensional affine Lorentz space [formula] Since γ(t) is arbitrary, it follows that G(U) lies on [formula] Notice that G(q) belongs to the vector space L(q) and, consequently, - G(q) also belongs to L(q). Thus, [formula] pass through the origin. Hence, [formula] By ([\ref=2]), [formula] This implies that g restrict to U reduces codimension to n + d. So we can apply Theorem 1.2 in [\cite=C-D] and Corollary 1.1 in [\cite=Si] for conclude that there is a conformal diffeomorphism Γ from an open subset of [formula] containing f(U) to an open subset of [formula] containing g(U) such that [formula] This finish proof of Case II and of Theorem 1.2.
