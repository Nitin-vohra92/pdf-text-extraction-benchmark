The six-dimensional Delaunay polytopes

Introduction

A distance vector [formula] with [formula] is called an (n + 1)-hypermetric if it satisfies the following hypermetric inequalities:

[formula]

The set of distance vectors satisfying ([\ref=Definition-of-hypermetrics]) is called the hypermetric cone and denoted by HYPn + 1.

In fact, HYPn + 1 is a polyhedral cone (see [\cite=DGL93] p. 199). Lovasz (see [\cite=DL] p. 201-205) gave another proof of it and bound [formula] for any vector b = (bi)0  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1 defining a facet of HYPn.

There is a one-to-one correspondence between non-degenerate elements of HYPn + 1 and semi-metrics on affine basis of n-dimensional Delaunay polytopes. So, the enumeration of combinatorial types of n-dimensional Delaunay polytopes is reduced to the enumeration of non-degenerate faces of HYPn + 1 under an equivalence relation called geometrical equivalence (see Remark [\ref=The-Simple-Case-Of-Geometrical-Equivalence] and Section [\ref=Enumeration-Techniques]). Moreover, the dimension of faces of HYPn + 1 allows to define the notion of rank of a Delaunay polytope (see [\cite=DGL92]).

We have the inclusion CUTn  ⊂  HYPn, where CUTn (see Section [\ref=Section-DimensionSix] below and Chapter 4 of [\cite=DL]) is the cone generated by all cut semi-metrics on n points. One has HYPn = CUTn for n  ≤  6; so, the enumeration of combinatorial types of Delaunay polytopes of dimension less or equal to five correspond to the study of faces of CUT6. This study was done by Fedorov ([\cite=Fe85]), Erdahl and Ryshkov ([\cite=ErRyI] and [\cite=ErRyII]), and Kononenko ([\cite=Ko3]) in dimension three, four and five, respectively.

In the case of dimensional six, the inclusion CUT7  ⊂  HYP7 is strict, but the description of facets (i.e. faces of rank 20, corresponding to repartitioning polytopes) and extreme rays (i.e. faces of rank 1, corresponding to extreme Delaunay polytopes) of the cone HYP7 is still possible (see [\cite=DD-hyp]). In Section [\ref=Section-DimensionSix] we present the number of combinatorial types of six-dimensional Delaunay polytope for every given rank. In Section [\ref=Enumeration-Techniques] we present our method for the computation of those combinatorial types using the face lattice of HYP7.

Voronoi [\cite=Vo] defines a partition of the cone PSDn of positive semi-definite quadratic forms by L-type domains. Two forms of the same L-type domain have affinely equivalent Voronoi polytopes. Every vertex of a Voronoi polytope correspond to a center of a Delaunay polytope. All Delaunay polytopes form a partition of the space [formula], which is dual to the partition by Voronoi polytopes. It is proved in [\cite=DGL93] that the hypermetric cone HYPn is the union of a finite number of L-type domains.

While Voronoi theory of L-type domains describes the combinatorial structure of lattices, the theory of hypermetrics ([\cite=DGL92] and [\cite=DL]) describes combinatorial structure of one Delaunay polytope in a lattice. While the hypermetric cone HYPn has the symmetry group Sym(n), a L-type domain, in general, has trivial group.

Delaunay polytopes and hypermetrics

Here we present the main notions for hypermetrics, which are needed to our study; the presentation is slightly simplified by the systematic use of affine bases. For the complete theory, with proofs, see [\cite=DGL92] and Chapters 13-16 of [\cite=DL].

A family [formula] of n + 1 vertices of [formula] is called independent if the family (vi - v0)1  ≤  i  ≤  n has linear rank n. Let [formula] be a n-dimensional lattice and let S = S(c,r) be a sphere in [formula] with center c and radius r. Then S is said to be an empty sphere in L if the following two conditions hold:

||v - c||  ≥  r for all v∈L and

the set [formula] contain an independent set of size n + 1.

The center c of S is called a hole in [\cite=CS]. The polytope D, which is defined as the convex hull of the set [formula] is called a Delaunay polytope, or (in original terms of Voronoi, who introduced them in [\cite=Vo]) L-polytope.

Let D be a n-dimensional Delaunay polytope with vertex-set V.

(i) A family v0, , vn of vertices of D is called an affine basis if for all v∈V there exist an unique family [formula], such that

(ii) The Delaunay polytope D is called basic if it has at least one affine basis. The vertices of an affine basis are called basic vertices.

All known Delaunay polytopes are basic. We prove in Theorem [\ref=ThanksSlava] that all six-dimensional Delaunay polytopes are basic too. We will always assume that Delaunay polytopes are basic.

For every family [formula] of vertices of a Delaunay polytope P one can define a distance function dA by dA(i,j) = ||vi - vj||2. The function dA turns out to be an hypermetric by the following formula (see [\cite=As] and [\cite=DL] p. 195) : On the other hand, Assouad has shown in [\cite=As] that every d∈HYPn + 1 can be expressed as dA with A being a family of vertices of a Delaunay polytope D of dimension less or equal to n.

A ray d∈HYPn + 1 is called non-degenerate if d = dB with B an affine basis of a n-dimensional Delaunay polytope D. For a given ray d∈HYPn + 1 the annulator is defined by

We call basic vectors the vectors [formula] with 0  ≤  i  ≤  n. Using Proposition below, those vectors ei are identified with basic vertices vi. One has H(b) = 0 if and only if b = ei for some 0  ≤  i  ≤  n.

Let D be an n-dimensional Delaunay polytope with vertex-set V; let d = dA with [formula] a family of V. Then there is equivalence between following properties:

(i) the family A is independent and

(ii) [formula].

Also one has equivalence between properties:

(iii) A is an affine basis and

(iv) the following mapping is one-to-one

Proof.   The family (vi)0  ≤  i  ≤  n is independent if and only if the matrix ((vi - v0).(vj - v0))1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n is positive definite. The formula 2(vi - v0).(vj - v0) = ||vi - v0||2  +  ||vj - v0||2  -  ||vi - vj||2, gives the first equivalence. The second equivalence is obvious.

By above Proposition, the set Ann(d) is finite if d is non-degenerate, since the hypermetric vectors b∈Ann(d) correspond to lattice points v, which belong to a sphere. We will consider only non-degenerate hypermetrics (in the hypermetric cone HYPn + 1) associated with affine bases of n-dimensional Delaunay polytopes.

Using above mapping, we identify vertices v of D with hypermetric vectors b. For example, for the affine basis [formula] with v0 = (0,0,0), v1 = (1,0,0), v2 = (0,1,0) and v3 = (0,0,1) of the 3-cube, one has (1,1,0) = v1 + v2 - v0, (0,1,1) = v2 + v3 - v0, (1,0,1) = v1 + v3 - v0 and (1,1,1) = v1 + v2 + v3 - 2v0. Note that, while ( - 2,1,1,1)∈Ann(dB), the inequality H( - 2,1,1,1)d  ≥  0 does not define a facet of the cone HYP4, since H( - 2,1,1,1) = H( - 1,1,1,0) + H( - 1,0,1,1) + H( - 1,1,0,1).

The face F(d), associated to an hypermetric d∈HYPn + 1, is the minimal face, containing the vector d. It can also be defined as:

The rank of a n-dimensional Delaunay polytope D is defined as dimension of F(dB), where B is an affine basis of D (see [\cite=DL] p. 217); its corank is, by definition, [formula]. The rank of a Delaunay polytope D is equal to the topological dimension of the set of affine bijections T of [formula] (up to translations and orthogonal transformations), for which T(D) is again a Delaunay polytope (see [\cite=DL] p. 225).

If D is an n-simplex, then its unique affine basis defines an hypermetric d, which has [formula] and F(d) = HYPn + 1. If D is a n-dimensional Delaunay polytope with n + 2 vertices [formula] (such polytope is called repartitioning polytope) and affine basis [formula], then, by writing [formula], one obtains F(dB) = {d∈HYPn + 1,H(b)d = 0}. So, F(d) is a facet of HYPn + 1. On the other hand, if d∈HYPn + 1 with F(d) being a facet, then [formula] and d = dB with B being an affine basis of a repartitioning polytope.

Define two Delaunay polytopes to be affinely equivalent, if there is an affine bijective mapping transforming one into another; the equivalence classes by this relation are called combinatorial type. By Theorem 15.2.1 in [\cite=DL] p. 222, two vectors d, d' of HYPn + 1, such that F(d) = F(d'), correspond to affinely equivalent Delaunay polytopes. Moreover, if two Delaunay polytopes D, D' are affinely equivalent, then an affine basis B of D induces an affine basis B' of D', such that F(dB) = F(dB').

A face of HYPn + 1 is called non-degenerate, if one of its interior vectors d is non-degenerate (by Theorem 15.2.1 of [\cite=DL], this is equivalent to all interior vectors being non-degenerate). One can consider only non-degenerate faces, since we already assumed, that all Delaunay polytopes are basic. Given a face F of HYPn + 1, we define

[formula]

We will call [formula] an affine basis of the combinatorial type if [formula]. Any affine basis of Ann(F) corresponds to an affine basis of a Delaunay polytope D, if D has this combinatorial type.

Two faces F, F' of HYPn + 1 are said to be geometrically equivalent if there exist an affine basis [formula] of Ann(F), such that the mapping is bijective.

If π is a permutation of [formula] and F a face of HYPn + 1, then [formula] is an affine basis of Ann(F); so, two faces F and F', which are equivalent, by a symmetry of HYPn + 1, are also geometrically equivalent. The reverse is not true, in general.

Let D be a n-dimensional repartitioning polytope with an affine basis [formula]; we write [formula]. The family [formula] is an affine basis if and only if |bi| = 1.

If bi =  - 1, then F(dB') = F(dB) = {d∈HYPn + 1,H(b)d = 0}, while if bi = 1, then [formula] with [formula].

So, the study of combinatorial types of n-dimensional Delaunay polytopes is reduced to the study of non-degenerate faces of the hypermetric cone HYPn + 1 under the geometrical equivalence.

Consider, as an example, the two-dimensional case. We have HYP3 = CUT3 and CUT3 has three facets, which correspond to H( - 1,1,1) and its permutations. One can check that a triangle T  =  {v0,v1,v2} satisfies dT = (d01,d02,d12)∈HYP3 if and only if it is an obtuse triangle. The vector dT is non-degenerate if and only if three vertices of T are not aligned. Moreover, dT is incident to an hypermetric facet, say, H( - 1,1,1), if and only if the vertex v0 has angle [formula], in which case the Delaunay polytope has four vertices: v0, v1, v2 and v1 + v2 - v0. So, there are two combinatorial types of Delaunay polytopes in dimension two: obtuse triangles and rectangles.

Take a face F of the hypermetric cone HYPn + 1. To every b = (bi)0  ≤  i  ≤  n∈Ann(F), we associate a vertex [formula]; let the set of such vertices being denoted by V. Every distance vector d∈F correspond to a Gram matrix G. The set V is the vertex-set of a Delaunay polytope, which is described by the scalar product defined by G. So, we can encode, in our computations, the combinatorial type of Delaunay polytope by the set Ann(F).

If D is a Delaunay polytope and B, B' are two affine bases of D, then the faces F(dB), F(dB') are equivalent up to a linear mapping. This linear mapping preserve the non-degeneracy.

Proof.   If [formula] and [formula] are two affine bases of D, then one can express v'i in terms of (vj)0  ≤  i  ≤  n as follows One can express ||v'i1 - v'i2||2 in terms of ||vj1 - vj2||2. This induces a linear mapping φ from F(dB) to F(dB'); expressing vj in terms of (v'i)0  ≤  i  ≤  n, one get the reverse mapping φ- 1 and so, the linear equivalence.

If d∈F(dB), then d is non-degenerate if and only if φ(d) is non-degenerate.

Let B be an affine basis of a Delaunay polytope D; then

(i) If rank  D = 1, then D is called extreme.

(ii) If all sub-faces of F(dB) are degenerate, then D is called maximal.

Above definition of maximality is independent of the choice of affine basis B, since, by above Proposition, the linear equivalence between two faces preserves the non-degeneracy. Obviously, any extreme Delaunay polytope is maximal. We present in Corollary [\ref=Maximal_Delaunay_polytopes] the list of all maximal six-dimensional Delaunay polytopes.

Let γn  =  {0,1}n be the vertex-set of the Delaunay polytope of the lattice [formula] and let be the vertex-set of the Delaunay polytope with center [formula] (this polytope is called half n-cube) of the root lattice

The n-cube γn and the half n-cube hγn have rank n and are maximal Delaunay polytopes.

Proof.   One can define the following distance functions on γn and hγn: If d is the distance function of the n-dimensional Delaunay polytope γn or hγn, then this distance function is expressed as which proves that the rank of γn and of hγn is n. Now, if a face F is included in F(γn) or F(hγn), then one of the coefficients λi becomes zero and the face F corresponds to γn - 1 or hγn - 1, which is of lower dimension n - 1. So, the Delaunay polytopes γn and hγn are maximal.

The case of dimension six

Call cut cone and denote by CUTn + 1 the cone generated by all cuts [formula] (where S is a subset of [formula]), defined by Clearly, H(b)δS = b(S)(1 - b(S)) with [formula]; this proves that all hypermetric inequalities are valid on CUTn + 1. So, CUTn + 1  ⊂  HYPn + 1. Moreover, a cut δS is incident to the face, defined by H(b), if and only if b(S) = 0 or 1.

The list of 3773 facets of HYP7 was found by Baranovskii [\cite=Ba99] using the method described in [\cite=Ba70], i.e. he found, by hand, that for all other hypermetric vectors b, one can express H(b) as a sum of terms H(b') with b' belonging to his list of 3773 elements. While this result was announced in [\cite=Ba99], the detailed computations were not published. In [\cite=DD-hyp], another method was proposed: if the Baranovskii's list was not complete, then, in our computation [\cite=DD-hyp] of the extreme rays of HYP7, we should find some extreme rays, which are not hypermetric. But this was not the case; so, the list is complete.

The list of representents of 14 orbits of facets is given below:

It gives the total of 3773 inequalities. The first ten orbits are the orbits of hypermetric facets of the cut cone CUT7; first four of them come as 0-extension of facets of the cone HYP6 = CUT6 (see [\cite=DL], Chapter 7). Last four orbits consist of some 19-dimensional simplex-faces of CUT7, becoming 20-dimensional, i.e. simplex-facets in HYP7.

Using Remark [\ref=The-Simple-Case-Of-Geometrical-Equivalence], we obtain that the list of 14 orbits of facets fall into nine equivalence classes b1, b2, {b3,b4}, b5, b6, {b7,b8}, {b9,b10}, {b11,b12}, {b13,b14}. So, there are nine combinatorial types of six-dimensional Delaunay polytopes of rank 20 (i.e. repartitioning polytopes).

In [\cite=DL] p. 229 another notion, called switching by root of b, is defined: if [formula] and b(A) = 0, then define bA by bAi =  - bi if i∈A and bAi = bi if i∉A. It is proved that the switching by root of a facet-defining vector of HYPn + 1 is again a facet-defining vector. Three following vectors define facets of HYP7, which are switching by root equivalent: On the other hand, b1 and b3 are geometrically equivalent by Remark [\ref=The-Simple-Case-Of-Geometrical-Equivalence], while b1 and b2 are not geometrically equivalent.

Remind that E6, E7, E8 are root lattices defined by

Unique type of Delaunay polytope of E6 is called Schlafli polytope (see [\cite=Cox63]) and denoted by Sch. Its skeleton graph is 27-vertex (strongly regular) graph, called the Schlafli graph, whose symmetry group has size 51840 and is isomorphic to the group of isometry, preserving the Schlafli polytope. This group is denoted by Aut(Sch).

In [\cite=DGL92] were found 26 orbits of non-cut extreme rays of HYP7 by classifying the affine bases of the Schlafli polytope of the root lattice E6. For every non-cut extreme ray [formula] of HYP7, there exist a facet-inducing inequality f(x)  ≥  0 of CUT7, which is non-hypermetric, so that f(v) < 0. This property establish a bijection between the 26 orbits of non-hypermetric facets of the cut cone CUT7 (see [\cite=Gcut]) and the 26 orbits of non-cut extreme rays of HYP7 and proves that HYP7 has 29 orbits of extreme rays: three orbits of non-zero cuts and 26 orbits coming from Sch (see [\cite=DD-hyp]).

Let B be an affine basis of Schlafli polytope; then

(i) The distance vector dB is incident to 20 hypermetric faces of HYP7, which are all facets of HYP7.

(ii) If F is a face of HYP7, containing the vector dB, then it is non-degenerate and |Ann(F)| = 7 + corank(F).

Proof.   The Schlafli polytope is six-dimensional and has 27 vertices. So, for every affine basis B, the vector dB satisfies H(b)dB = 0 for 27 different b∈Ann(dB); we write [formula]. On the other hand, it is known ([\cite=DGL92] and [\cite=DL] p. 239), that the Schlafli polytope has rank 1. So, the rank of the matrix

[formula]

Computational methods

Our computation of combinatorial types of six-dimensional Delaunay polytopes used the face-lattice of HYP7; combinatorial types of Delaunay polytopes of corank i + 1 were found from combinatorial types of Delaunay polytopes of corank i. We start from the list of combinatorial types of corank 1, i.e. the nine repartitioning polytopes. The plan of our computation was as follows:

Take the list of combinatorial types of Delaunay polytopes of corank i.

For each of them, find all sub-faces, using our knowledge of facets and extreme rays of HYP7; we obtain faces of corank i + 1.

For every face F of corank i + 1, find extreme rays [formula], contained in it, and define [formula]. The distance vector d is in the interior of F; so, using Proposition [\ref=BasicReductionResult], one can test if this ray is non-degenerate or not and this tells us if the face is non-degenerate or not.

Find the classes of geometrical equivalence amongst the non-degenerate faces and so, the list of combinatorial types of corank i + 1.

Above procedure finds all combinatorial types of Delaunay polytopes from corank 1 (i.e. repartitioning polytopes) till corank 20 (i.e. the Schlafli polytope). But in order to describe completely our method, we need to precise how we find the classes under geometrical equivalence.

The first algorithm for the problem of geometrical equivalence is the following: given two faces F and F', find all affine bases of Ann(F) until one finds an equivalence φF,F' (see Definition [\ref=DefinitionGeometricalEquivalence]). This method works for corank 1 or 2 and was used by Kononenko in the five-dimensional case. But the number of affine bases becomes too important to be workable in corank 3.

So, one needs another, more efficient method. The first idea is to split the set of faces of HYP7 into two classes: faces, which contain (one or more) Schlafli extreme rays, and those, which are generated only by cuts.

Let F be a face of HYP7, which contains a Schlafli extreme ray dB corresponding to an affine basis [formula]. Then, every b∈Ann(F) defines a vertex [formula] of Sch. All such vertices are denoted by S(F,dB).

So, every combinatorial type of faces, which contains at least one Schlafli extreme ray, can be interpreted as a set of vertices of Sch.

Let F and F' be two faces, which contain at least one Schlafli extreme ray; then it holds:

(i) If F and F' are geometrically equivalent, then for every Schlafli extreme ray dB in F, there exist an affine basis B' of Sch, such that S(F,dB) = S(F',dB').

(ii) If F and F' contain a Schlafli extreme ray dB and dB', such that S(F,dB) is identical to S(F',dB') up to an element of Aut(Sch), then F and F' are geometrically equivalent.

Proof.   For every distance vector dB∈F, one gets an identification of Ann(F) with S(F,dB). If F' is geometrically equivalent to F, then the vectors [formula] in Ann(F') are identified with vertices [formula] in S(F,dB). These vertices form an affine basis B' and one has S(F',dB') = S(F,dB); so, (i) holds.

Since S(F,dB) is isomorphic to S(F',dB') by an element of Aut(Sch), one can, without loss of generality, assume that they are identical. Now, B is identified with vertices [formula] of S(F,dB) and B' is identified with vertices [formula] of S(F,dB). Then, the expression of v'j in terms of vi determine an affine basis of Ann(F), for which the mapping φF,F' is well-defined and bijective.

Above Proposition express the geometrical equivalence in terms of the existence of an element of Aut(Sch) mapping a set of vertices into another set of vertices. Those sets of vertices are identified with corresponding sets of vertices of the Schlafli graph (the Schlafli graph and the Schlafli polytope have the same symmetry group Aut(Sch)). So, the problem is expressed in graph-theoretic terms and can be solved, using, for example, the nauty program ([\cite=MK]). Therefore, one can build the geometrical equivalence classes.

Now, we extend above method to the case of faces generated by cuts. Let F be a face, generated by cuts {δ(Si)}1  ≤  i  ≤  N; we first need to find Ann(F), i.e. all vectors [formula] with [formula], having H(b)δ(Si) = 0.

Those equations can be rewritten as [formula] with xi = 0 or 1, i.e. a linear system in b. This linear system has rank n + 1, because of Proposition below; so, one can find the set Ann(F) for every face, generated by cuts.

Let F be a face of HYPn + 1 generated by cuts (δ(Si))1  ≤  i  ≤  N. Then the following properties are equivalent:

(i) the face F is non-degenerate and

(ii) the linear system, formed by the equations [formula] and [formula], has solution set {0}.

Proof.   If the face F is degenerate, then there exist a vertex v, which can be expressed in two different forms [formula]. So, after denoting αi = bi - b'i, one gets [formula] with [formula] and b + kα belongs to Ann(F). Therefore, one gets (b + kα)(Si) = 0 or 1, and [formula] for all [formula]. This is possible only if [formula] and [formula].

Let the solution set be non-zero, i.e. suppose that one can find an integer-valued non-zero solution α. This implies that the vectors e0 + kα belong to Ann(F) for every [formula]. So, Ann(F) is infinite and F is degenerate.

If we write [formula], then every cut δ(Si)∈F with 1  ≤  i  ≤  N defines an Euclidean semi-metric on the set [formula]; this semi-metric can be uniquely extended to Ann(F) by δi(b,b') = |b(Si) - b'(Si)|.

So, to every face, generated by cuts, one can associate a set of semi-metrics on Ann(F), which are, in fact, cut semi-metrics.

A combinatorial type of Delaunay polytope encodes all possible embeddings of Ann(F) into the vertex-set V of a Delaunay polytope of a lattice. These embeddings are completely described by the distance vector dV on their vertices. This distance vector is expressed as [formula] with λi > 0.

Therefore, the combinatorial type of a face, generated by cuts, corresponds to the description of all semi-metrics on this set. This information can be expressed in graph-theoretic terms; so, we can test if two faces, generated by cuts, are isomorphic, using the nauty program ([\cite=MK]). So, again one can build the geometrical equivalence classes and our method is completely described.
