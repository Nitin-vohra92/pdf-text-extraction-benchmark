High-pT Pion Production in Heavy-Ion Collisions at RHIC energies

Introduction

The calculation of high-pT particle production at SPS and RHIC energies requires solid theoretical background, based on perturbative QCD (pQCD). In these calculations, the choice of renormalization, factorization and fragmentation scales are typically chosen in the range pT / 3  ≤  Q  ≤  2pT. Earlier we have found [\cite=BGG] that the theoretical reproduction of the measured nuclear effects in pA and AA collisions (specifically the Cronin effect [\cite=cronin75]) strongly depends on the choice of the above scales. In the following we display new results analysing preliminary RHIC data [\cite=QM12] on pion production in AuAu  →  π0 at [formula] AGeV and 200 AGeV.

Perturbative QCD calculations with intrinsic kT

In pQCD-improved parton model (including intrinsic kT) pion production was calculated in leading order (LO) [\cite=plf00] [\cite=zfpbl02] and next-to-leading order (NLO) [\cite=pappnlo]. An intermediate solution to speed up the time consuming full NLO calculations is to determine a Kjet(s,pT,jet,Q) factor corresponds to higher order contributions at jet level in pp collisions [\cite=bflpz01] and apply it in the factorized pQCD equation. In this case the pion production in AA collision can be described as:

[formula]

The partonic cross section, [formula], is the LO Born term, which is multiplied by Kjet(s,pT,jet,Q) in eq. ([\ref=hadX]). ([formula], [formula] and û are parton-level Mandelstam variables.) The nuclear thickness function, [formula], is normalized as [formula]. The nuclear parton distribution functions (PDF) fa / A(x,Q2) are based on the nucleon PDFs (fa / p(xa,Q2)) and modified in the nuclear environment ("shadowing") [\cite=wang91]. We are using NLO MRST [\cite=MRST] PDF set with Q = pT,jet scale, where pT,jet = pT / zc.

In a phenomenological approach, we introduced an extra 2-dimensional Gaussian transverse momentum distribution as the PDF's extension [\cite=zfpbl02]:

[formula]

We have found the Gaussian width (〈k2T〉pp) to be pT independent in the window 2 GeV ≤  pT  ≤  6 GeV. Nuclear multiscatterings yield an extra broadening in pA collision, which can be related to the number of nucleon-nucleon (NN) collisions in the medium and denoted by C   ·   hpA(b). Here C means the average increase in the transverse momentum width in one NN collision and hpA(b) is a geometrical effectivity function. This latter quantity can be saturated [\cite=plf00] [\cite=zfpbl02]. The Dπ / c(zc,Q'2) is the fragmentation function (FF), which gives the probability for parton c to fragment into π at momentum fraction zc and fragmentation scale Q'. In this paper we fix Q'  =  pT / 2 and use the KKP parametrization[\cite=KKP].

pQCD result on pp and AuAu at RHIC energies

In Figure 1 we display our results at [formula] AGeV (left panels) and 200 AGeV (right panels). In the upper panels the dashed curves indicate the pp results which can be compared to the preliminary PHENIX data[\cite=QM12] at [formula] GeV. Full dots indicate the π0 data from peripheral AuAu collisions, the calculated pion spectra (solid lines) approximately overlap with the data. We obtained N130bin,p = 19 binary collisions for 60 - 80% peripheral case and N200bin,p = 10 for 70 - 80% peripheral case. A satisfactory agreement between the data and the calculations demonstrate the validity of the improved pQCD calculation.

Full squares indicate the data for central collisions. The number of binary collisions are N130bin,c = 857 for 10% central AuAu case at [formula] AGeV, and N200bin,c = 940 at [formula] AGeV. One can find a large difference between central data and theoretical spectra (full lines), a suppression factor of ~  4 - 5 appeared.

Lower panels display the nuclear modification factor, defined as

[formula]

This expression magnifies the enhancement of particle production in AuAu, relatively to the Nbin upscaled pp collision on a linear scale. Applying shadowing[\cite=wang91] and multiscattering, the Cronin peak can be seen clearly in both peripheral (dotted lines) and central (solid lines) collisions. The position of Cronin peak depends on the 〈k2T〉pp value, and the height depends on the extra broadening[\cite=BGG], C   ·   hpA(b). One can see that the height of the peak in central case is larger than in peripheral one, which effect is caused by the number of nucleon-nucleon collisions inside a nucleus. We have fixed the PDF scale Q = pT,jet and FF scale Q' = pT / 2 to obtain the peak's maximum at pT  ≈  3 GeV/c. The comparison of PHENIX data (full squares) with theoretical calculations display a difference of ~  5. This suppression value is indicated on lower panels with a dashed lines. The origin of this suppression is jet quenching[\cite=QM01].
