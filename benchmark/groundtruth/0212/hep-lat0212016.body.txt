Some remarks on cyclization and periodicity

Introduction

Let us put in correspondence to any function [formula] function

[formula]

This procedure [formula], which we call cyclization, is used not infrequently (see e.g. [\cite=Schwartz]), but as a rule is applied to such functions [formula] that decrease quite rapidly with φ  →    ±    ∞   and [formula] turns out to be periodic. In this paper we consider cases when the above condition is not true and [formula].

It is worth noting from the outset that since shift [formula] [formula] leads to some sort of interchange of summations, function [formula] may appear to be aperiodic, if series [formula] is not absolutely convergent.

Indeed, if we take as an example

[formula]

then after cyclization we get

[formula]

which, taking into account ([\cite=pbm] 6.2.3.[formula]) may be written as

[formula]

It is easy to check that

[formula]

In many interesting cases series in [formula] is divergent in ordinary sense, then to compute [formula] it is rational to apply distribution theory where rigorous methods is developed for summing extensive class of such series [\cite=Schwartz] [\cite=gel-shil] [\cite=vladimirov] [\cite=bremermann]. In particular, such methods allow to compute integrals of tempered distributions and series which terms coincide with some tempered function at integer values of the argument [\cite=Schwartz].

Recall that [formula] is tempered distribution, if and only if it is finite order derivative of some tempered function. Continuous [formula] function is called a tempered one [\cite=bremermann], if exists some σ that

[formula]

It is important that every periodic distribution [formula] is tempered [\cite=donoghue] and Fourier transform of any tempered distribution is tempered distribution as well [\cite=bremermann].

It is known that any tempered distribution [formula] or [formula] may be presented as (see e.g. [\cite=vladimirov]).

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are analytical functions in upper/lower complex half-plane φ and ε is routine positive infinitesimal parameter.

It may be easily checked, if to choose

[formula]

and

[formula]

then expression [formula] will coincide with an Abel-Poisson regularization of Fourier integral

[formula]

Abel-Poisson regularization provide continuous convergence Fourier integrals [formula] and series [formula] in a case when Ft is tempered distribution and Fourier coefficients Fn coincide with values of some tempered distribution at integer t = n.

In particular, due to continuous convergence of regularized integrals, the order of integration in double integrals may be changed and it may be shown, that the transform inverse to [formula] is

[formula]

are continuously convergent it allows to change the order of integration and summation, thus taking into account the Poisson relation

[formula]

one can easily find that application of the procedure [formula] to regularized integral [formula] gives

[formula]

In a case when for all integer n function Ft obeys the condition

[formula]

series [formula] coincides with [formula] and Fn can be considered Fourier coefficients which may be computed, as it follows from [formula] and [formula], from the ordinary relation

[formula]

For Ft to exist function [formula] should be only locally summable rather than summable. However, if [formula] is summable, its Fourier transform Ft is bounded for any real t [\cite=Schwartz].

It is worth to note, that too rigid constraint on class function to which [formula] belongs, may lead to quite trivial class function Ft and, consequently, trivial [formula]. Indeed, let [formula] be infinitely differentiable with compact support (i.e. belongs to Schwartz space [formula]), then, according to [\cite=gel-shil], its Fourier transform Ft belongs to space of entire functions [formula]. If in addition

[formula]

for any direction in the complex plane t, and Ft is bounded for all integer t = n, then, according Polya theorem (see e.g. [\cite=pal-wein]), Fn = const.

It is evident that, if condition [formula] is fulfilled, function [formula] given by [formula] may be presented as regularized Fourier series [formula] and consequently is periodic.

Singular Ft

In a case when function [formula] is not summable, Fourier transform Ft may appear to be singular at integer t = n, as in already considered example [formula] where Ft, computed with ( [\cite=brych-prud] 402), may be written as

[formula]

The case of singular Ft needs special consideration. As it is seen from [formula], to obtain [formula] we have to compute the product of two distributions: [formula] and Ft. Unfortunately, the product of arbitrary distributions is not defined (see e.g. [\cite=Schwartz]), so we shall confine ourself to the consideration of well-defined products, namely the case when singularity of Ft at some integer t = k is a pole of order m. More general case will be considered elsewhere. To be specific we consider k = 0 i.e. Ft  ~  t- m for [formula].

Let us take as an example [formula]. Making allowance for ([\cite=brych-prud] 13), one may write

[formula]

and in this case

[formula]

is infinite at t = 0.

It is easy to check that

[formula]

which leads to

[formula]

where the first term is evidently periodic due to explicit invariance under φ  →  φ + 2π

[formula]

Since a logarithm is a many-valued function, we get the ambiguous result

[formula]

where nφ is an integer number, which numbers the branches of the logarithm.

To reduce ambiguity, we choose, as it is generally done, among the infinite set of logarithm branches, the principal one

[formula]

where the periodic function [formula] is defined in the interval -  π < x < π as [formula] .

The second term in [formula]

[formula]

has the singular integrand that with the help of a simple equation

[formula]

may be rewritten as

[formula]

This term is evidently aperiodic.

Taking into account

[formula]

where [formula] stands for integer part of x (called also [formula]), one may finally write

[formula]

A more general case may be considered, making allowance ([\cite=brych-prud] 22)

[formula]

that leads to

[formula]

so one may write

[formula]

Recall that (see e.g. [\cite=bateman] 1.13[formula])

[formula]

where [formula] is Bernoulli polynomial of order n. Unfortunately, expression [formula] is true only for 0 < φ < 2π [\cite=bateman]. One may see, however, that an extension of [formula] on negative φ may be easily done by the substitution φ  →  φ + 2π, which doesn't effect explicitly periodic right side of [formula], but transforms condition 0 < φ < 2π into - 2π  <  φ < 0, and we may finally write

[formula]

Proceeding as in previous case and taking into account ([\cite=brych-prud] 21)

[formula]

we may compute

[formula]

that leads to

[formula]

In particular for m = 1 we get

[formula]

It should be noted that for some functions [formula] after lifting Abel-Poisson regularization [formula] 'converges' to infinity. In particular, for [formula]

[formula]

We see that for noninteger α function [formula] whereas for integer α = k one gets [formula]

Conclusions

This paper is an attempt to reveal a mechanism that actualizes a known connection between discretization of Fourier variables and periodicity in the associated space.

It is shown that the application of procedure [formula] to function [formula] doesn't lead to the periodicity of function [formula] if Fourier transform of [formula] has a pole at some integer value of its argument. If, on the contrary, Ft is finite for all integer t = n, function [formula] is periodic.
