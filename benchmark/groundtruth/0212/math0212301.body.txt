On the volume of spherical Lambert cube

Partially supported by Russian Foundation for Basic Research (Grant 00-15-96165)

Introduction

The calculation of volumes of polyhedra in Euclidean, spherical and hyperbolic spaces is very old and difficult problem. The main principles for volume calculations in non-euclidean geometries were given in 1836 by Lobachevsky [\cite=L] and in 1852 by Schläfli [\cite=Sh]. In particular, they have found the volumes of the orthogonal three-dimensional simlicies (orthoschemes).

In general, every polyhedron can be decomposed into a finite number of orthoschemes. But, in spite of this, an elementary formula for volume of non-euclidean simplex is still unknown.

About 1935 Coxeter [\cite=C] revived interest in the work of these two authors by developing an integration method for non-euclidean orthoschemes of dimension three. This method was generalized by Böhm [\cite=B] for spaces of constant non-vanishing curvature of arbitrary dimension. Further advance in this direction was achieved in the papers by Vinberg [\cite=V], Milnor [\cite=M] and Ruth Kellerhals [\cite=K]. The simplest generalization of notion of three-dimensional orthoscheme is the Lambert cube Q(α,β,γ). Recall that Q(α,β,γ) is a combinatorial cube, with dihedral angles α,β and γ assigned to the three mutually non-coplanar edges and right angles to the remaining.

The Lambert cube Q(α,β,γ) can be realized in the hyperbolic space ([\cite={K}] [\cite={HLM}]) if [formula] and in the spherical space [\cite=D] if [formula].

The hyperbolic volume of Q(α,β,γ) was found in [\cite=K] in terms of the Lobachevsky function

In the present paper the spherical volume of Q(α,β,γ) is defined in the terms of the function which can be considered as a spherical analog of the function

The main result of the work is the following theorem.

It is interesting to compare properties of the function δ(α,θ) with the properties of the function [formula]. Notice that the hyperbolic volumes of knots, orbifolds and cone manifolds in many cases can be expressed in terms of [formula] (see [\cite={Th}] [\cite={MV}] [\cite={V}] [\cite={K}]). In particular, the main result of the work [\cite=K] can be rewrited in the following form.

The volume of a hyperbolic Lambert cube Q(α,β,γ) with essential angles α,β and γ , [formula] is given by the formula where θ, [formula] is the principal parameter defined by conditions

[formula]

Metric properties of Lambert cube

Consider the Euclidean space [formula][formula] with the metric

induced by the scalar product where A,B and C are given positive numbers.

Define The sphere S3 endowed with the metric dσ2 becomes the spherical space with the constant Gaussian curvature k = 1. To see that we set ds2  =  dx2  +  dy2  +  dz2  +  dt2. Then the mapping [formula] [formula] defined by (x,y,z,t)  →  (Ax,By,Cz,t) is an isometry sending the unit sphere in [formula] onto [formula].

At the same time we consider R4 as a projective space RP3 with the homogeneous coordinates (x:y:z:t).

As the Klein model [formula] of the spherical space [formula]3 choose the hyperplane [formula][formula], which will be identified further with the Euclidean space [formula]3  =  {(x,y,z):x,y,z∈R}.

There exists one-to-one correspondence between [formula] and the upper semisphere [formula][formula] formed by projection from the origin.

Reflections in coordinate planes and rotations in coordinate lines of [formula]4 are both Euclidean and spherical isometries.

Following to [\cite=HLM] we realize the spherical Lambert cube Q(α,β,γ) as a projection of the Euclidean polyhedron P(a,b,c) represented on the Fig. [\ref=fig1] .

We can assume that the essential angles α,β and γ are formed by the pairs of the planes [formula], [formula] and [formula]. The projective equations of the planes [formula], [formula] and [formula] are the following

[formula]

The poles of these planes Pa,Pb and Pc are given by

[formula]

respectively. Then the conditions of the orthogonality are equivalent to the equalities As a result we have the following relations or Hence

[formula]

The poles [formula] and [formula] of the planes [formula], [formula] and [formula] symmetric to the planes [formula], [formula] and [formula] with respect to z = 0, x = 0 and y = 0 respectively are given by

[formula]

The angle between [formula] and [formula] is equal 2α and we have Hence and by analogy we obtain

[formula]

As a result we have the following

[formula] of the spherical space [formula]3 = (S3,dσ2) has the right dihedral angles between the faces intersecting at the point [formula] if and only if Moreover, the dihedral angles α, β and γ of P(a,b,c) satisfy the relations

[formula]

Set L =  tan α, M =  tan β, N =  tan γ and find an algebraic equation for variable in terms of L, M, N. By Lemma [\ref=l1], we have

[formula]

Multiplying the first of equations by B2 and subtracting the third, we express B2 by means of A2B2C2. Similarly, expressing A2 and C2, we have

[formula]

By multiplying the equations, we obtain where T =  - ABC.

Note that T =   ±  1 is a root of the above equation of order six. Rewrite the equation in the following equivalent form In the case T2 = 1 we have A2B2C2 = 1. Then from ([\ref=f0]) and ([\ref=ff0]) we deduce the identity Hence, the equation under consideration is equivalent to By definition, T =  - ABC, where A,B,C > 0.  Hence, T as a negative root of the equation

Notice that ([\ref=f0]) can be rewritten in the form As a result we obtain the following

Now we shall find the lengths of edges for spherical polyhedron Q(α,β,γ). First we find the length Lα of the edge with dihedral angle  α. The projective coordinates of the terminal points of the edge are given by Let s100 and s1a0 be their projections on the upper hemisphere We have where [formula]. Hence By analogy, for we have where [formula] is defined by Lemma [\ref=l1]. It gives

We obtain We notice that the polyhedron P(a,b,c) is contained in the first octant of the Euclidean space [formula]3(see Fig. [\ref=fig1]). Hence, the spherical length Lα of the edge whose dihedral angle α satisfies the inequality [formula]. Thus and By analogy we obtain

[formula]

So we prove the following

As an immediate corollary of Lemma [\ref=l1] and Lemma [\ref=l2] we obtain the following theorem (see also [\cite=D]).

Let α,β and γ are such that [formula]. Then there exists a spherical Lambert cube with the essential angles α,β and γ .

By Lemma [\ref=l2], the values A2,B2 and C2 uniquely determined by the equalities Then by Lemma [\ref=l1], we conclude the existence of the Euclidean polyhedron P(a,b,c).

The spherical cube Q(α,β,γ) with the essential angles α,β and γ is a result of projection of P(a,b,c) into S3.

For our purposes we need metrical relations between essential angles and lengths of Lambert cube Q(α,β,γ). They are given by the following two theorems.

By Lemma [\ref=l1], Lemma [\ref=l3] and the condition [formula], we have and Then where T is the same as in Lemma [\ref=l2]. By the same way, we obtain the other equalities of the theorem.

The parameter T from Theorem [\ref=t4] can be presented in the form T =  tan θ, where [formula]. The value θ plays the significant role in the studying of metric structure of Lambert cube and is called a principal parameter.

The following theorem is a direct corollary of Theorem [\ref=t4].

From Theorem [\ref=t4], we have Hence and by Lemma [\ref=l2], we have

[formula]

Since [formula] and the values [formula], the theorem is proved.

Up to cyclic permutation of angles α,β and γ, Theorem [\ref=t5] contains three independent equations which are sufficient to determine Lα, Lβ and Lγ in terms of α, β and γ.

The volume of spherical Lambert cube

From now on, for an arbitrary function [formula]R we shall write [formula] and φ(π) instead of [formula] and φ(π - 0), respectively, if the corresponding values have a sense.

Let V = V(α,β,γ) be the volume of spherical Lambert cube Q(α,β,γ) with essential angles α,β and γ.

Notice first that [formula], as [formula].

It can be justified by the following arguments. Each face of Q(α,β,γ) is a Lambert quadrilateral with essential angles α, β and γ tending to [formula]. Then there is a pair of opposite sides in the quadrilateral whose lengths tend to zero. We have decrease in the dimension in each face of Q(α,β,γ) and hence of Q(α,β,γ) itself. It means the volume tends to zero.

Thus, we shall consider the equality

[formula]

as a true one.

Let Lα,Lβ and Lγ be the lengths of edges whose dihedral angles α,β and γ, respectively. By the Schläfli formula (see [\cite=Sh], [\cite=M]), we have

[formula]

The volume of spherical Lambert cube Q(α,β,γ), [formula] is given by the formula

[formula]

where T is a negative root of the equation L =  tan α, M =  tan β and N =  tan γ.

By the above arguments the volume function V = V(α,β,γ) satisfies () with initial data (). We set where and show that  [formula] satisfies conditions () and () . Then [formula] and the proposition is proven.

By the Leibnitz formula we obtain

[formula]

By [formula] we have F(T,L,M,N) = 0. Moreover, since α   =    arctan L, we have Hence, by Tangent Rule, we obtain from () The equalities can be obtained by the similar way.

To verify the initial condition () for function [formula] we remark that L,M,N  →    +    ∞   as [formula], hence T  →    -    ∞  . From the convergence of integral (), we have [formula] as T  →    -    ∞  .

The proof of the main theorem

By Proposition [\ref=main], we have

[formula]

where Let T =  tan θ, L =  tan α, M =  tan β and N =  tan γ. Then under substitution t =  tan τ we obtain

[formula]

Hence, ([\ref=v1]) yields

[formula]

Explicit volume calculations

This section is devoted to the explicit volume calculations in some particular cases.

Remind that where and L =  tan α, M =  tan β, N =  tan γ . Let By applying the elementary trigonometry we have and

[formula]

Hence tan θ =  - 1 and consequently, [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=mm] and Corollary [\ref=td1](iii) (see Appendix), we obtain

[formula]

In particular, we have the following.

{Consider the process of degenerating of Lambert cube Q(α,β,γ) as γ  →  π. Let [formula] be the length of the edge opposite to the edge with essential angle γ. The straightforward calculations based on Theorem [\ref=t5] show that [formula] tends to zero as γ  →  π. As a result the singular Lambert cube Q(α,β,π) can be defined as a cone under the plane spherical quadrilateral with the angles [formula] (Fig [\ref=fig2]) .

Applying Theorem [\ref=mm] and Corollary [\ref=td1](iv) in case γ  =  π, we obtain the following

The volume of a singular Lambert cube Q(α,β,π), [formula] is given by the formula

Appendix

This section is devoted to elementary properties of the function [formula] and its relations to the Dilogarithm, Lobachevskij and Schläfli functions.

Now we list the following elementary properties of the function [formula].

The function satisfies the following properties

The properties (i) - (iv) can be deduced directly from the definition of [formula]. To prove the second statement of the property (ii) we observe that the equality is evidently true for θ = 0. By definition of [formula], the derivatives of the both sides of the equality with respect to θ are equal to zero. To see the equality we notice that the derivatives of the both sides with respect to θ are equal. To establish the property we have to check the equality for one fixed value of θ. Let θ = 0. The equality holds for k = 0. For any k∈Z from properties (iii) and (ii) we have and Hence and the first statement of (v) follows by induction. The value of [formula] can be taken from the corollary [\ref=td1] bellow. The property (vi) follows from properties (i) - (iv).

For explicit calculations it is more convenient to use the following alternative form of [formula].

where 0 < arccot x < π for all x.

By definition, we have Hence

[formula]

Notice that Hence

We use the proposition to calculate the value of [formula] in some cases. The results of our calculations are collected in the following corollary.

The result easy follows from Proposition [\ref=p2] and properties (i) - (iii) of function δ.

The relation [formula] to the Schläfli function

Let T(α,β,γ) be a double-rectangular spherical, Euclidean or hyperbolic tetrahedron with dihedral angles π / 2 - α, β and π / 2 - γ. Define the Schläfli function by the following formula where (see Coxeter

[formula]

, p. ~ 16)

In hyperbolic case (cos 2α cos 2γ  <   cos 2β, α,γ  <  β), Coxeter notice (

[formula]

, p. ~ 23 or

[formula]

, p.125) where a,b and c are the spherical lengths of edges correspondent to dihedral angles [formula] and [formula] respectively, and [formula].

2 step. We note that T is a root of the following biquadratic equation

[formula]

where A =  tan α, B =  tan β and C =  tan γ. Indeed, the above equation has four roots T1,2  =    ±  1 and T3,4  =    ±   sin α sin γ / D. The equation [formula] has the following geometrical sense. By the Tangent Rule, we have [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Hence [formula] gives and after the suitable choosing the sign we obtain

[formula]

This is the Cosine Rule for double-rectangular spherical tetrahedron T(α,β,γ).

3 step. Let V = V(α,β,γ) be the volume of T(α,β,γ). By the Schläfli formula we have

[formula]

It follows from the Tangent Rule that

[formula]

4 step. It is easy to check (see the proof of Proposition [\ref=main]) that the function is a solution of () with the initial condition (). Hence [formula]. Since [formula] we have

[formula]

where Let T =  tan θ. Then under substitution t =  tan τ we obtain

[formula]

Hence

The relation [formula] to the Lobachevskij function

Let and

Let [formula], [formula] <  π / 4 and [formula]. Then

Let We have to show that [formula] satisfy the equation

[formula]

with the initial condition [formula]. It means [formula] and the proposition follows.

Note, that

[formula]

From [formula] and definition of [formula] we have

[formula]

From definition of [formula] we deduce

[formula]

Since we obtain

[formula]

The equalities [formula] and [formula] give [formula]. The initial condition [formula] follows directly from definitions of [formula] and [formula].

The relation [formula] to the Dilogarithm

Here we consider the relation to the Dilogarithm function ([\cite=Le], p. 292)

Recall that [formula] is a π-periodic function with respect to α and for 0 < α  <  π.

Let α∈R and -  π / 4 < θ < 3π / 4. Then

Since for -  π / 2 < μ  <  π / 2 we have

The property [formula] of function [formula] gives

[formula]

and under substitution θ  =  π / 4 - μ we obtain from [formula] and [formula] for -  π / 4 < θ < 3π / 4.
