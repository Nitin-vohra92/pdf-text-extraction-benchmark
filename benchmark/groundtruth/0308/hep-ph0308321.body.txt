In our previous papers [\cite=1] [\cite=2] [\cite=3] [\cite=4] [\cite=5] [\cite=6] we have presented the arguments in favour of that the Kaluza-Klein picture of the world is confirmed by the experimentally observed hadronic spectra.

In papers [\cite=1] [\cite=2] the nucleon-nucleon dynamics at very low energies has been studied and we have found that geniusly simple formula for KK excitations provided by Kaluza-Klein approach gives an excellent description for the mass spectrum of two-nucleon system. In articles [\cite=3] [\cite=4] we have presented additional arguments in favour of Kaluza and Klein picture of the world. In fact, we have shown that simple formula provided by Kaluza-Klein approach with the fundamental scale calculated early [\cite=1] gives an excellent description for the mass spectrum of two-pion and three-pion systems. Taking this line, we have performed an analysis of experimental data on mass spectrum of the resonance states containing strange mesons and compared them with the calculated values provided by Kaluza-Klein scenario [\cite=5]. By this way we have found out quite an interesting correspondence shown below

From this correspondence it follows that Kπ-system looks like a system built from two-pion system by replacement of some one pion with a kaon. In fact, all experimentally observed hadronic states in Kπ-system have the corresponding partners in two-pion system. However, some hadronic states in two-pion system do not have the corresponding strange partners in Kπ-system experimentally observed so far. That is why the further study of Kπ-system is quite a promising subject of the investigations.

Concerning three-pion system we have found out that

Moreover, we predict the strange partner of a2-meson which we would like to call as as2-meson; see Table 17 and Table 21 in [\cite=5]

Apart of isospin as2(1520)-meson may have the same quantum numbers as a2(1311)-meson. We call up to search as2(1520)-meson and other strange partners of the three-pion states experimentally observed till now. In this respect it seems the factory with an intensive kaon beams would be a very good device to realize such programm.
