Extraordinary dimension of maps

Introduction

The paper deals with extensional dimension of maps, specially, with the extraordinary dimension introduced recently by epin [\cite=es:98] and studied by the first author in [\cite=ch:03]. If L is a CW-complex and X a metrizable space, we write X  ≤  L provided L is an absolute extensor for X (in such a case we say that the extensional dimension of X is ≤  L, see [\cite=d:1], [\cite=d:2]). The extraordinary dimension of X generated by a complex L, notation dim LX, is the smallest integer n such that X  ≤  ΣnL, where ΣnL is the n-th iterated suspension of L (by Σ0L we always denote the complex L itself). If L is the 0-dimensional sphere S0, then dim L coincides with the covering dimension dim . We also write dim Lf  ≤  n, where f:X  →  Y is a given map, provided dim Lf- 1(y)  ≤  n for every y∈Y. Next is our main result.

Let f:X  →  Y be a σ-perfect map of metrizable spaces, let L be a CW-complex and n  ≥  1. Consider the following properties:

dim Lf  ≤  n;

There exists an Fσ subset A of X such that dim LA  ≤  n - 1 and the restriction map [formula] is of dimension [formula];

There exists a dense and Gδ subset G of C(X,n) with the source limitation topology such that dim L(f  ×  g) = 0 for every g∈G;

There exists a map g:X  →  n is such that dim L(f  ×  g)  =  0.

Then (3)  ⇒  (3')  ⇒  (1) and (3')  ⇒  (2). Moreover, (1)  ⇒  (3) provided Y is a C-space and L is countable.

Here, f:X  →  Y is σ-perfect if X is the union of countably many closed sets Xi such that f(Xi)  ⊂  Y are closed and the restriction maps f|Xi are perfect.

Theorem [\ref=T:1.1] is inspired by the following result of M. Levin and W. Lewis [\cite=ll:02]: If X and Y are metrizable compacta then (3)  ⇒  (3')  ⇒  (1) and (3)  ⇒  (2')  ⇒  (1), where (2') is obtained from our condition (2) by replacing [formula] with [formula]. Moreover, the implication (1)  ⇒  (3) was also established in [\cite=ll:02] for a finite-dimensional compactum Y and a countable CW-complex L.

Therefore, we have the following characterization of extraordinary dimension of perfect maps between metrizable spaces:

Let f:X  →  Y be a perfect surjection between metrizable spaces with Y being a C-space. If L is a countable CW-complex, then the following conditions are equivalent:

dim Lf  ≤  n;

There exists a dense and Gδ subset G of C(X,n) with the source limitation topology such that dim L(f  ×  g)  ≤  0 for every g∈G;

There exists a map g:X  →  n is such that dim L(f  ×  g)  ≤  0.

If, in addition, X is compact, then each of the above three conditions is equivalent to the following one:

There exists an Fσ set A  ⊂  X such that dim LA  ≤  n - 1 and the restriction map [formula] is of dimension [formula].

The equivalence of the first three conditions follow from Theorem [\ref=T:1.1]. More precisely, by Theorem [\ref=T:1.1] we have the following implications: (2)  ⇒  (3)  ⇒  (1)  ⇒  (2). When X is compact, the result of Levin-Lewis which was mentioned above yields that (2)  ⇒  (4)  ⇒  (1). Therefore, combining the last two chains of implications, we can obtain the compact version of Corollary [\ref=C:1.2].

Corollary [\ref=C:1.2] is a parametric version of [\cite=ch:03]. For the covering dimension dim  such a characterization was obtained by Pasynkov [\cite=bp:96] and Toruczyk [\cite=ht] in the realm of finite-dimensional compact metric spaces and extended in [\cite=tv:02] to perfect maps between metrizable C-spaces. Since the class of C-spaces contains the class of finite-dimensional ones as a proper subclass (see [\cite=re:95]), the compact version of Corollary [\ref=C:1.2] is more general than the Levin-Lewis result [\cite=ll:02]. It is interesting to know whether all the conditions (1)-(4) in Corollary [\ref=C:1.2] remain equivalent without the compactness requirement on X and Y.

The source limitation topology on C(X,M), where (M,d) is a metric space, can be described as follows: a subset U  ⊂  C(X,M) is open if for every g∈U there exists a continuous function α:X  →  (0,  ∞  ) such that [formula]. Here, [formula] denotes the set [formula]. The source limitation topology doesn't depend on the metric d if X is paracompact and C(X,M) with this topology has the Baire property provided (M,d) is a complete metric space. Moreover, if X is compact, then the source limitation topology coincides with the uniform convergence topology generated by d.

All function spaces in this paper, if not explicitely stated otherwise, are equipped with the source limitation topology.

Some preliminary results

Throughout this section K is a closed and convex subset of a given Banach space E and f:X  →  Y a perfect map with X and Y paracompact spaces. Suppose that for every y∈Y we are given a property P(y) of maps h:f- 1(y)  →  K and let P  =  {P(y):y∈Y}. By CP(X|H,K) we denote the set of all bounded maps g:X  →  K such that g|f- 1(y) has the property P(y) for every y∈H, where H  ⊂  Y. We also consider the set-valued map [formula], defined by the formula [formula], where C*(X,K) is the space of bounded maps from X into K.

Suppose that P  =  {P(y)}y∈Y is a family of properties satisfying the following conditions:

CP(X|H,K) is open in C*(X,K) with respect to the source limitation topology for every closed H  ⊂  Y;

g∈CP(X|{y},K) implies g∈CP(X|U,K) for some neighborhood U of y in Y.

Then the map ψP has a closed graph provided C*(X,K) is equipped with the uniform convergence topology.

The proof of this lemma follows the arguments from the proof of [\cite=tv:02].

Recall that a closed subset F of the metrizable apace M is said to be a Zm-set in M, if the set [formula] is dense in C(m,M) with respect to the uniform convergence topology, where m is the m-dimensional cube. If F is a Zm-set in M for every m∈, we say that F is a Z-set in M.

Suppose y∈Y and P(y) satisfy the following condition:

For every m∈ the set of all maps h∈C(m  ×  f- 1(y),K) with each h|({z}  ×  f- 1(y)), z∈m, having the property P(y) (as a map from f- 1(y) into K) is dense in C(m  ×  f- 1(y),K) with respect to the uniform convergence topology.

Then, for every α:X  →  (0,  ∞  ) and g∈C*(X,K), [formula] is a Z-set in [formula] provided [formula] is considered as subset of C*(X,K) equipped with the uniform convergence topology and ψP(y)  ⊂  C*(X,K) is closed.

See the proof of [\cite=tv:02]

Let [formula]. It suffices to show that, for fixed g0∈C*(X,K) and a positive continuous function α:X  →  (0,  ∞  ), there exists [formula]. We equip C*(X,K) with the uniform convergence topology and consider the constant (and hence, lower semi-continuous) convex-valued map φ:Y  →  2C*(X,K), [formula], where α1(x) =  min {α(x),1}. Because of the conditions (a) and (b), we can apply the selection theorem [\cite=gv:99] to obtain a continuous map h:Y  →  C*(X,K) such that [formula] for every y∈Y. Observe that h is a map from Y into [formula] such that h(y)∈CP(X|{y},K) for every y∈Y. Then g(x) = h(f(x))(x), x∈X, defines a bounded map [formula] such that g|f- 1(y) = h(y)|f- 1(y), y∈Y. Therefore, g∈CP(X|{y},K) for all y∈Y, i.e., [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=T:1.1]

[formula] Suppose that L is countable and Y is a C-space. Let Xi be closed subsets of X such that each fi = f|Xi:Xi  →  Yi = f(Xi) is a perfect map and Yi is closed in Y. Then all Yi's are C-spaces, and since the restriction maps πi:C(X,n)  →  C(Xi,n), πi(g) = g|Xi, are open, the proof of this implication is reduced to the case when f is a perfect map. Consequently, we may assume that f is perfect.

By [\cite=tv1] (see also [\cite=bp:98]), there exists a map q from X into the Hilbert cube Q such that f  ×  q:X  →  Y  ×  Q is an embedding. Let {Wi}i∈ be a countable finitely-additive base for Q. For every i we choose a sequence of mappings [formula], representing all the homotopy classes of mappings from [formula] to L (this is possible because L is a countable CW-complex). Following the notations from Section 2, for fixed i, j and y∈Y we say that a map g∈C(X,n) has the property Pij(y) provided

the map [formula] can be continuously extended to a map over the set [formula] for every t∈g(f- 1(y)).

Let Pij  =  {Pij(y):y∈Y} and for every H  ⊂  Y we denote [formula] by Cij(X|H,n). Hence, Cij(X|H,n) consists of all g∈C(X,n) having the property Cij(y) for every y∈H. Let ψij:Y  →  2C(X,n) be the set-valued map [formula].

Let g∈Cij(X|{y},n). Then, there exist a neighborhood Uy of y in Y and a neighbourhood Vt  ⊂  n of each t∈g(f- 1(y)) such that [formula] can be extended to a map from [formula] into L.

Since g∈Cij(X|{y},n), [formula] can be extended to a map from [formula] into L for every t∈g(f- 1(y)). Because L is an absolute neighborhood extensor for X, there exists and open set Gt  ⊂  X containing [formula] and a map [formula] extending [formula]. Using that f  ×  g is a closed map, we can find a neighborhood Uty  ×  Vt of (y,t) in Y  ×  n such that St = (f  ×  g)- 1(Uty  ×  Vt)  ⊂  Gt. Next, choose finitely many points t(k), k = 1,2,.,m, with [formula] and a neighbothood Uy of y in Y such that [formula] and [formula] (this can be done since f is perfect). If t∈g(f- 1(y)), then t∈Vt(k) for some k and [formula]. Since , St(k)  ⊂  Gt(k), the map ht(k) is an extension of [formula] over the set [formula]

The set Cij(X|H,n) is open in C(X,n) for any i,j and closed H  ⊂  Y.

We follow the proof of [\cite=tv:02]. For a fixed g0∈Cij(X|H,n) we are going to find a function α:X  →  (0,  ∞  ) such that [formula]. By Lemma 3.1, for every z = (y,t)∈(f  ×  g0)((f- 1(H)) there exists a neighborhood Uz in Y  ×  n such that

(1)[formula] can be extended to a map from [formula] into L.

Obviously, K = (f  ×  g0)((f- 1(H)) is closed in Y  ×  n, so there exists open G  ⊂  Y  ×  n with [formula]. Then [formula] is an open cover of Y  ×  n. Let γ be an open locally finite cover of Y  ×  n such that the family

(2){St(W,γ):W∈γ} refines ν and St(W,γ)  ⊂  G provided [formula].

Consider the metric ρ = d  +  d1 on Y  ×  n, where d is a metric on Y and d1 the usual metric on n, and define the function α:X  →  (0,  ∞  ) by [formula]. Let show that [formula]. Take [formula], y∈H and t∈g(f- 1(y)). Then, (y,t) = (f  ×  g)(x) for some x∈f- 1(y). Since g is α-close to g0, there exists W∈γ such that [formula] and W contains both (f  ×  g)(x) and (f  ×  g0)(x). It follows from (2) that (f  ×  g)- 1(W)  ⊂  (f  ×  g0)- 1(Uz) for some z∈K. In particular, [formula]. Consequently, by (1), [formula] is extendable to a map from [formula] into L. Therefore, [formula] for every y∈H which completes the proof.

Because of Lemma 3.1 and Lemma 3.2, we can apply Lemma 2.1 to obtain the following corollary.

For any i and j the map ψij has a closed graph.

Let g∈C(X,n), α:X  →  (0,  ∞  ) and y∈Y. Then, for any i,j, [formula] is a Z-set in [formula] provided [formula] is considered as a subset of C(X,n) with the uniform convergence topology.

It follows from [\cite=ll:02] that if m∈, then all maps g:m  ×  f- 1(y)  →  n such that [formula] for every z∈m and t∈n, form a dense subset G of C(m  ×  f- 1(y)) with the uniform convergence topology. It is clear that, for every g∈G and z∈m, the restriction [formula], considered as a map on f- 1(y), has the following property: [formula] can be extended to a map from [formula] into L for any t∈n. Hence, we can apply Lemma 2.2 to conclude that [formula] is a Z-set in [formula].

Now, we can finish the proof of this implication. Because of Corollary 3.3 and Lemma 3.4, we can apply Proposition 2.3 to obtain that the set Cij = Cij(X|Y,n) is dense in C(X,n) for every i,j. Since, by Lemma 3.2, all Cij are also open, their intersection G is dense and Gδ in C(X,n). Let show that dim L(f  ×  g)  ≤  0 for every g∈G, i.e., (f  ×  g)  ≤  L. We fix y∈Y and t∈n and consider the fiber [formula]. Take a closed set [formula] and a map h:A  →  L. Because the map qy = q|f- 1(y) is a homeomorphism, [formula] is well defined. Next, extend h' to a map from a neighborhood W of q(A) (in Q) into L and find Wi with [formula]. Therefore, there exists a map [formula] extending h'. Then h'' is homotopy equivalent to some hij, so are [formula] and [formula] (considered as maps from [formula] into L). Since [formula] can be extended to a map from [formula] into L, by the Homotopy Extension Theorem, there exists a map [formula] extending [formula]. Obviously, [formula] extends h. Hence, [formula].

[formula] The implication (3)  ⇒  (3') is trivial. It is easily seen that in the proof of (3')  ⇒  (1) we can assume f is perfect. Let g:X  →  n be such that dim L(f  ×  g)  ≤  0 and y∈Y. Then the restriction g|f- 1(y):f- 1(y)  →  n is a pefect map with all of its fibers having extensional dimension   ≤  L. Hence, by [\cite=cv:1], f- 1(y)  ≤  ΣnL, i.e, dim Lf  ≤  n.

[formula] Because of the countable sum theorem, we can suppose that f is perfect. We fix a map g:X  →  n such that dim L(f  ×  g)  ≤  0. According to [\cite=tv:02], there exists an Fσ subset B  ⊂  Y  ×  n such that dim B  ≤  n - 1 and [formula] for every y∈Y. Then, applying again [\cite=cv:1], we conclude that the set A = (f  ×  g)- 1(B) is as required.
