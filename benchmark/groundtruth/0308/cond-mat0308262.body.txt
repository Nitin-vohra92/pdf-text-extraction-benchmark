Inhomogeneous metallic phase upon disordering a two dimensional Mott insulator

Disorder can lead to new important phenomena: such as localization in disordered media[\cite=gangof4] [\cite=lee-tvr], metal-insulator transitions[\cite=mit_review], precisely quantized Hall plateaus in the quantum Hall effect, and zero resistance from pinned vortices in a type II superconductor. In systems as diverse as superconducting films[\cite=ghosal], high Tc cuprates[\cite=davis] and manganites[\cite=dagotto] disorder produces nanoscale inhomogeneities which can have a profound influence on the properties of these systems.

We propose the existence of a new metallic phase at T = 0 which is generated when potential disorder is introduced into a Mott insulator. This metallic phase is highly inhomogeneous and coexists with long range antiferromagnetic order. It is sandwiched between two qualitatively different insulators: at low disorder, a Mott insulator with a spectral gap and antiferromagnetic (AFM) long range order, and, at high disorder, a paramagnetic Anderson insulator with gapless excitations. Our result is surprising since one would expect that the primary role of disorder is to localize wave functions, which is opposite to the conditions for forming extended states necessary for metallic behavior.

We find that the route to the formation of a metal at intermediate disorder is the following: Given a random potential profile, there are two types of regions: weakly disordered (WD) with relatively small potential fluctuations and strongly disordered (SD) with larger fluctuations. AFM order exists in the WD regions that consist of singly occupied sites with a large local Mott gap. On the other hand, in the SD regions the local density deviates from one per site which disrupts the antiferromagnetic ordering and also leads to the collapse of the gap locally. There is thus a 'phase separation' between the insulating AFM WD regions and the metallic SD regions with suppressed AFM. The low lying excitations of the system remain trapped in the SD regions. With increasing disorder the SD regions grow and along with that, the eigenfunctions get extended throughout the system and the system becomes metallic at intermediate disorder. At high disorder the system becomes a paramagnetic Anderson insulator. We substantiate the above picture with calculations of the magnetic correlations, the local density of states and the optical conductivity.

We propose that experiments on cuprates in their parent Mott insulating phase, could introduce disorder by isoelectronic substitution, or by bombardment, without changing the carrier doping. Such experiments should be able to see this unusual metallic phase at intermediate disorder. Recently, Vajk et. al[\cite=vajk] have measured the spin correlations using neutron scattering in La2CuO4 with Zn substitution on the Cu sites. It will be necessary to complement the magnetic information from neutron scattering with transport and spectroscopy to look for signatures of an inhomogeneous metallic phase.

Model and Calculation: We model the 2D disordered Mott insulator by a repulsive Hubbard model at half filling (one electron per site) with potential disorder:
