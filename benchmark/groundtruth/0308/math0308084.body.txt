Some remarks about metric spaces, 2

Let (M,d(x,y)) be a metric space. Thus M is a nonempty set, and d(x,y) is a real-valued function defined for x,y∈M such that d(x,y)  ≥  0 and d(x,y)  =  d(y,x) for all x,y∈M, d(x,y)  =  0 if and only if x  =  y, and

[formula]

for all x,y,z∈M. This last property is called the triangle inequality.

Suppose that f(x) is a real-valued function on M. If C is a nonnegative real number, then we say that f(x) is C-Lipschitz if

[formula]

for all x,y∈M, which is equivalent to saying that

[formula]

for all x,y∈M. Notice that a function is 0-Lipschitz if and only if it is constant.

For instance, for each p∈M, the function fp(x)  =  d(x,p) is 1-Lipschitz. More generally, if A is a nonempty subset of M, then the distance of a point x in M to A is denoted [formula] and defined by

[formula]

and one can check that this function is 1-Lipschitz. If f1, f2 are two real-valued functions on M which are C1, C2-Lipschitz, respectively, and if α1, α2 are real numbers, then max (f1,f2), min (f1,f2) are C-Lipschitz with C  =   max (C1,C2), and α1  f1  +  α2  f2 is C-Lipschitz with C  =  |α1|  C1  +  |α2|  C2.

Now suppose that C is a nonnegative real number and that s is a positive real number. A real-valued function f(x) on M is said to be C-Lipschitz of order s if

[formula]

for all x,y∈M, which is again equivalent to

[formula]

for all x,y∈M. As before, f(x) is 0-Lipschitz of order s if and only if f(x) is constant on M.

When 0  <  s  <  1, one can check that d(x,y)s is also a metric on M, which defines the same topology on M in fact. The main point in this regard is that the triangle inequality continues to hold, which follows from the observation that

[formula]

for all nonnegative real numbers α, β. A real-valued function f(x) on M is C-Lipschitz of order s with respect to the metric d(x,y) if and only if f(x) is C-Lipschitz of order 1 with respect to d(x,y)s, and as a result when 0  <  s  <  1 one has the same statements for Lipschitz functions of order s as for ordinary Lipschitz functions.

When s  >  1 the triangle inequality for d(x,y)s does not work in general, but we do have that

[formula]

for all x,y,z∈M, because

[formula]

for all nonnegative real numbers α, β. Some of the usual properties of Lipschitz functions carry over to Lipschitz functions of order s, perhaps with appropriate modification, but for instance it may be that the only Lipschitz functions of order s when s  >  1 are constant.

Of course Lipschitz functions of any order are continuous. The Lipschitz conditions provide concrete quantitative versions of the notion of continuity. Let us point out that in general the product of two functions which are Lipschitz of order s may not be Lipschitz of order s, but that this is the case if at least one of the functions is bounded.

In harmonic analysis one considers a variety of classes of functions with different kinds of restrictions on size, oscillations, regularity, and so on, and these Lipschitz classes are fundamental examples. In particular, it can be quite useful to have the parameter s available to adjust to the given circumstances. There are also other ways of introducing parameters to get interesting classes of functions and measurements of their behavior.

If M is the usual n-dimensional Euclidean space [formula], with its standard metric, then one has the extra structure of translations, rotations, and dilations. If f(x) is a real-valued function on [formula] which is C-Lipschitz of order s, f(x  -  u) is also C-Lipschitz of order s for each [formula], f(Θ(x)) is C-Lipschitz of order s for each rotation Θ on [formula], and f(r- 1x) is (C  rs)-Lipschitz of order s for each r  >  0. In effect, one general metric spaces we can consider classes of functions and measurements of their behavior which have analogous features, even if there are not exactly translations, rotations, and dilations.

On Euclidean spaces there is the classical Fourier transform, and for instance smoothness of a function can be related to the size of the Fourier transform in various ways. With the Fourier transform there are very precise versions of information at different wavelengths, including very specific ranges of wavelengths. As in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, however, there is a balance between details of location and details of ranges of wavelengths.

With simple measurements like [formula], one has some information about location and range of wavelengths, but not too precisely for either one. Quantities like these also make sense in general settings, without a lot of fine structure as for Euclidean spaces. At the same time, one gets at information and structure which is interesting in the classical case of Euclidean spaces as well as other situations.

A basic notion is to consider various scales and locations somewhat independently. In this regard, if f(x) is a real-valued function on M, x is an element of M, and t is a positive real number, put

[formula]

We implicitly assume here that f(y) remains bounded on bounded subsets of M, so that this quantity is finite.

Thus f is C-Lipschitz of order s if and only if

[formula]

for all x∈M and t  >  0. Now, instead of considering basic Lipschitz conditions like these, one can also look at other kinds of bounds for [formula]. Moreover, one can consider other kinds of local measurements of size and oscillation.

Let us pause a moment and notice that

[formula]

when d(w,x)  +  r  ≤  t. Thus,

[formula]

when d(x,w)  +  r  ≤  t and r  ≥  t / 2.

This is a kind of "robustness" property of these measurements of local oscillation of a function f on M. In particular, to sample the behavior of f at essentially all locations and scales, it is practically enough to look at a reasonably-nice and discrete family of locations and scales. For instance, one might restrict one's attention to radii t which are integer powers of 2, and for a specific choice of t use a collection of points in M which cover suitably the various locations at that scale.

Instead of simply taking a supremum of some measurements of local oscillation like this, one can consider various sums of discrete samples of this sort. This leads to a number of classes of functions and measurements of their behavior. One can adjust this further by taking into account the relation of some location and scale to some kind of boundaries, or singularities, or concentrations, and so on.

Of course one might also use some kind of measurement of sizes of subsets of M. This could entail volumes, or sizes in terms of covering conditions, or measurements of capacity. One can then look at integrals of f and its powers, integrals involving the local oscillation numbers [formula], sizes of sets where some other measurements are large, etc.

There are also many kinds of local measurements of oscillation or size that one can consider. As an extension of just taking suprema, one can take various local averages, or averages of powers of other quantities. Of course one can still bring in powers of the radius as before.

Even if one starts with measurements of localized behavior which are not so robust in the manner described before, one can transform them into more robust versions by taking localized suprema or averages or whatever afterwards. Frequently the kind of overall aggregations employed have this kind of robustness included in effect, and one can make some sort of rearrangement to put this in starker relief. Let us also note that one often has local measurements which can be quite different on their own, but in some overall aggregation lead to equivalent classes of functions and similar measurements of their behavior.

There are various moments, differences, and higher-order oscillations that can be interesting. As a basic version of this, one can consider oscillations of f(x) in terms of deviations from something like a polynomial of fixed positive degree, rather than simply oscillations from being constant, as with [formula]. This can be measured in a number of ways.

However, for these kinds of higher-order oscillations, additional structure of the metric space is relevant. On Euclidean spaces, or subsets of Euclidean spaces, one can use ordinary polynomials, for instance. This carries over to the much-studied setting of nilpotent Lie groups equipped with a family of dilations, where one has polynomials as in the Euclidean case, with the degrees of the polynomials defined in a different way using the dilations.

These themes are closely related to having some kind of derivatives around. Just as there are various ways to measure the size of a function, one can get various measurements of oscillations looking at measurements of sizes of derivatives. It can also be interesting to have scales involved in a more active manner, and in any case there are numerous versions of ideas along these lines that one can consider.
