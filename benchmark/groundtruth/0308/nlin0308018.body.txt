Integrable mappings derived from the ΔΔRsG equation

Introduction

In this paper we consider the double discrete related sine-Gordon (ΔΔRsG) equation we recently introduced in [\cite=ai], i.e.

[formula]

We investigate the integrability of the mappings derived under the periodicity condition Vl + ζ2,m - ζ1 = Vl,m, with ζ1 and ζ2 being relatively prime. Under this periodicity condition, we derive the (ζ1  +  ζ2) dimensional map

[formula]

where Vl,m = Vn and n = ζ1l + ζ2m. When the map ([\ref=map]) is odd dimensional, it can be reduced to an even dimensional map under the reduction vi  =  Vi + Vi + 1.

The plan of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we show that the mapping ([\ref=map]), when ζ1 odd and ζ2 even or ζ1 even and ζ2 odd, is related to the mapping derived from the double discrete (alternative) Korteweg-de Vries (a ΔΔKdV) equation (given in [\cite=ai]) when ζ1 odd and ζ2 or ζ1 even and ζ2 odd, respectively. In section 3 we show that in the special case ζ1  =  1 and ζ2 even, the mapping ([\ref=map]) is a particular case of the hierarchy of integrable asymmetric mappings we introduced in [\cite=ai].

Double discrete related sine-Gordon (ΔΔRsG) equation

Consider the alternative ΔΔKdV (a ΔΔKdV) equation given in [\cite=ai], i.e.

[formula]

There are three possible cases to consider using the periodicity condition Vl + ζ2,m - ζ1 = Vl,m, 1) ζ1 odd and ζ2 even, 2) ζ1 even and ζ2 odd, and 3) ζ1 odd and ζ2 odd.

Case 1) When γ  =  ε = 0 together with

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

Case 2) When γ  =  ε = 0 and

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

In cases 1) and 2) the periodicity condition remains invariant under the transformation ([\ref=tran1]) and ([\ref=tran2]) and as a result the mapping derived from ([\ref=kdvmap]) (with γ  =  ε = 0) is the same as that derived from ([\ref=kdvmap1]) or ([\ref=kdvmap2]). In case 3), however, the periodicity condition does not remain invariant under the transformation ([\ref=tran1]) and ([\ref=tran2]) and as a result the mapping derived is different. We will not consider case 3) in this paper.

The mapping derived from ([\ref=kdvmap1]) or ([\ref=kdvmap2]) under the periodicity condition Vl + ζ2,m - ζ1 = Vl,m is

[formula]

with +   sign for case 1) and -   sign for case 2). Using the translations Vi  →  Vi  +  a / 2β and V'i  →  V'i  +  a / 2β and setting (β,ξ) = (c,  ±  (a2 / c  +  b)), the mapping ([\ref=map1]) becomes the mapping ([\ref=map]).

We now turn to the integrals of the mapping ([\ref=map]). We consider case 1) only, case 2) is similar. Under the periodicity condition Vl + ζ2,m - ζ1 = Vl,m and γ  =  ε = 0, ([\ref=kdvmap]) can be used to derive the (ζ1  +  ζ2) dimensional map

[formula]

Under the transformations Vi  →  ( - 1)iVi and V'i  →  ( - 1)iV'i the map ([\ref=map2]) becomes

[formula]

We note that the map ([\ref=map3]) can be written as [formula], where L is defined to be the map with coordinates V'i  =    -  Vi (for all i) and [formula] is the map ([\ref=map1]). Using this, we see that [formula], as L is an involution, i.e. [formula], where [formula] is the identity map. This shows that for all integrals Ii of the map [formula], we have [formula] for the map ([\ref=map1]). In fact [formula], i.e. the actual integrals of the mapping ([\ref=map1]) are I2i.

ζ1  =  1 and ζ2 even

In this section we show that in the special case ζ1  =  1 and ζ2 even, the mapping ([\ref=map]) is a particular case of the hierarchy of integrable asymmetric mappings mentioned above. We illustrate this with the four-dimensional case, i.e. ζ1 = 1 and ζ2 = 4.

When ζ1  =  1 and ζ2 = 4, the mapping ([\ref=map]) becomes

[formula]

Under the reduction w  =  V0  +  V1, x  =  V1  +  V2, y  =  V2  +  V3 and z  =  V3 + V4, we obtain the four-dimensional mapping

[formula]

Consider the four-dimensional case of the hierarchy of integrable asymmetric mappings given in [\cite=ai], i.e. the mapping

[formula]

Under the substitutions (w,x,y,z)  →  (w, - x,y, - z) and (w',x',y',z')  →  (w', - x',y', - z') the mapping ([\ref=L4]) becomes

[formula]

If we set ξ0  =  ξ1  =  ξ2  =  ξ3  =  ξ, γ0  =    -  γ1  =  γ2  =    -  γ3 =  - γ and ε = 0 the mapping ([\ref=L4s]) can be written as [formula], where L1 is given by

[formula]

which is equivalent to ([\ref=rsg4]). The integrals, I1 and I2 of the mapping ([\ref=L1]), can be obtained from the coefficients of the different powers of λ of the characteristic equation

[formula]

where I is the identity matrix and L(h) is the L matrix of the Lax pair (L,M) for the mapping ([\ref=L4]), see [\cite=ai]. We note that the integrals, I1 and I2, satisfy Ii(w,x,y,z) =  - Ii(w',x',y',z'), for i = 1,2, i.e the actual integrals for the mapping ([\ref=L1]) are Īi  =  I2i. The above discussion also shows that ([\ref=L1]) has an asymmetric form, i.e. ([\ref=L4s]), which is equivalent to ([\ref=L4]).

This procedure can be applied to any even ζ2 (with ζ1 = 1). Showing that the mappings obtained from the (ΔΔRsG), with ζ1 = 1 and ζ2 even, are special cases of the hierarchy of integrable asymmetric mappings introduced in [\cite=ai].

Conclusion

In this paper we have shown that the mappings derived from the (ΔΔRsG) equation, when ζ1 odd and ζ2 even or ζ1 even and ζ2 odd, are related to the mappings derived from the a ΔΔKdV equation, when ζ1 odd and ζ2 or ζ1 even and ζ2 odd, respectively. We have also shown that the mappings derived from the (ΔΔRsG) equation, when ζ1 = 1 and ζ2 even, are special cases of the hierarchy of integrable asymmetric mappings given in [\cite=ai]. We note that a similar relationship exists between the asymmetrized mappings obtained from the a ΔΔMKdV and a ΔΔsG (when ζ1 = 1 and ζ2 even) equations, see [\cite=ai]. An open question is whether a transformation exists relating these two hierarchies? If a transformation relating these two hierarchies does exist, then the hierarchy of asymmetric mappings given in [\cite=ai] is integrable (which we expect). Another open question is whether the mappings derived from the a ΔΔKdV, a ΔΔMKdV, a ΔΔsG5 and ΔΔRsG equations under an appropriate periodicity condition are special cases of the hierarchy of integrable asymmetric mappings given in [\cite=ai].

Appendix A. Intermediate forms

In [\cite=ai] we showed how to determine intermediate forms (i.e. where some symmetry in the variables exists) that are integrable using nonautonomous mappings. In this appendix we show another way of obtaining such forms, but this time using the hierarchy of autonomous integrable asymmetric mappings. We illustrate with the four dimensional case.

Consider ([\ref=L4]) when ξ2  =  ξ0, ξ3  =  ξ1, γ2  =  γ0 and γ3  =  γ1, i.e.

[formula]

The mapping ([\ref=L4sym]) can be written as [formula], where L2 is given by

[formula]

This mapping is equivalent to the mapping (D.4) of [\cite=ai]. In fact, if we make the substitutions (w,x,y,z)  →  (w,y,x,z) and (ŵ,x̂,ŷ,ẑ)  →  (ŵ,ŷ,x̂,ẑ) in the mapping ([\ref=L2]) we obtain the mapping (D.4). The integrals of (D.4) can be obtained in the same way, noting that the integrals of ([\ref=L2]) can be obtained from the Lax pair given in [\cite=ai].

More generally, the intermediate forms can be determined in the following way : find the possible integers i that divide n, e.g for n  =  16 we have i = 1,2,4,8,16. Set the γk's and ξk's to γl and ξl [formula] in such a way that we have i of each and the resulting asymmetric map can be written as L = Ln / ii. The intermediate form is Li.

The advantages in this method are 1) the mappings obtained need not be in general complex, whereas the mappings obtained using the method given in [\cite=ai] are, and 2) the intermediate forms are easily obtained.

Appendix B. Involutions

In this appendix we show that all the mappings given in this paper, and the mappings given in [\cite=ai] and [\cite=ai3d], can be written as a product (composition) of involutions.

First, we note that the cyclic shift, Lc, i.e.

[formula]

can be written as a product of involutions, i.e. [formula] (for n  ≥  3) , where the involution Lij is defined as vk' = vk (k  ≠  i,j) together with vi' = vj and vj' = vi (i < j).

The mapping ([\ref=L1]) can be written as [formula], where

[formula]

and w = v0, x = v1, y = v2 and z = v3.

The mapping ([\ref=L4sym]) can be written as [formula], where Lz is defined as

[formula]

Ly is defined as

[formula]

and w = v0, x = v1, y = v2 and z = v3.

The mappings given in the papers [\cite=ai] and [\cite=ai3d] can be written as a product of involutions or as an involution composed with a cyclic shift. For the latter, the above discussion shows that these mappings can be written as a product of involutions. Finally, for the mapping given in [\cite=ai3d], i.e.

[formula]

we have [formula], where Lz is given by

[formula]

L- is given by

[formula]

and x = v0, y = v1 and z = v2. We note that L- is an involution.

All of the above mappings are invertible since they are a product of involutions, i.e. [formula] (where the Li are involutions). Their inverse is [formula].
