In the past few years, progress in string phenomenology has been very encouraging. On one hand, the elucidation of the effective theories that describe the low energy dynamics of the light string excitations has been carried out to one genus and higher genus [\cite=dkl],[\cite=higher] in string calculations. A systematic scheme has been developed to obtain an effective theory with modular invariance to all loop orders. One loop and all loop gauge couplings in string effective theories have been obtained for a class of models [\cite=mary]-[\cite=linear]. On the other hand, the construction of "realistic" string models has been developed to produce some explicit string models. Even though none of them are totally realistic, some are very close to the standard model and might even make some good predictions [\cite=font]. Because of this progress, it is now possible confront specific models with data.

In this paper, we discuss the running gauge coupling constant unification in string effective theories. It is interesting to note that string unification has, in general, a more flexible meaning than standard model unification. On the other hand, because of the relation between the unification scale and the gauge coupling constant in string effective theory, the string analysis is more restrictive. We restrict our discussion to the minimal string model from an N = 1 orbifold with no N = 2 space-time supersymmetry. In this case, the running coupling constants do not have nontrivial moduli-dependent string threshold corrections [\cite=higher]. By minimal string model, we mean that the model has SU(3)  ×  SU(2)  ×  U(1) as observable gauge group (that is, we neglect possible mixing with additional U(1)'s, and do not consider intermediate scale gauge symmetry breaking) and N=1 supersymmetry below the compactification scale. In addition to the standard model matter content there are generally extra particles which become massive at some high energy scales. Our analysis will impose restrictions on the spectra of massive states. We pay particular attention to this kind of model not only because it is simple to analyse but also because it is the closest approximation to the standard model to date.

In the following we give the two-loop renormalization group equations (RGE) in string effective theory for a class of models derived from orbifold compactification. We take as a starting point the result of [\cite=mary] that suggests that two-loop unification occurs at the string scale ms. We will see that, under the assumption of weak coupling at the string scale, the scale [formula], where mP is the Planck mass, can be taken as the effective string unification scale in the first order RGE.

Whereas the unification of the running gauge coupling constants at some scale is a coincidence in the standard model, a relation among gravitational and gauge coupling constants at the string scale is required in string theory. It has been shown [\cite=gins] that at the string scale [formula]. Here the Planck mass mP is defined by GN  =  κ2 / 8π  =  1 / m2P . α' is the string tension and ki is the Kac-Moody level of the gauge algebra Gi. For a nonabelian gauge group its level is an integer and is determined by the corresponding Kac-Moody algebra realized on a world sheet. For a U(1) gauge group the level is defined to be Y = k1 / 2 [\cite=level], where Y is the the double-pole coefficient in the operator product expansion of the corresponding Kac-Moody currents. The relation is obtained under the assumption that any gauge symmetry has its origin in an internal Kac-Moody algebra as is the case for all known closed string theories. It is a general result in the sense that it does not depend on the particular realization of a gauge algebra in a model. To see the dependence of coupling constants on a scale, a string loop calculation has to be applied. In the following analysis, the U(1) charge is the weak hypercharge of the standard model, but normalized as in SU(5), so that k1 = k2 = k3 corresponds to coupling constant unification in the usual sense.

In string effective theory, the gauge coupling constant g is determined by the vacuum expectation value of the dilaton s: g- 2  =    <  Res  >  . The one loop modular invariant gauge coupling has been calculated [\cite=mary] for orbifolds with gauge group [formula] and ka = 1. A correspondence between the effective coupling constant and the running coupling constant in quantum field theory was proposed in [\cite=mary], where it was shown that the relation can be interpreted as the two loop running coupling constant [\cite=susy] with the string scale ms as the two loop unification scale, up to possible string threshold corrections. More precisely, the results of [\cite=mary] suggest the identification [formula], where [formula] is the reduced Planck mass, and εa is a small threshold correction. Here the running coupling constant g2(λ2) is to be interpreted as the measured coupling constant with external momenta - p2  =  λ2. This is related [\cite=tatu] to the scale μ of the [formula] regularization scheme by λ2  =  eμ2. In this scheme the unification scale becomes μ2s  =  e- 1αm2P / 4  =  αP2. Consequently, for scales μ > MSUSY, the running gauge coupling constants in string phenomenology can be written as:

[formula]

Here tI are the moduli and 4eμ2s / m2P  =  αaka  =  α. The index A denotes the matter content: [formula]. CGa is the quadratic Casimir operator in the adjoint representation of the gauge subgroup labeled by a, and CAa  =  Tr(TAa)2, where TAa is any generator of the gauge group Ga for the representation RA, is related to the quadratic Casimir operator Ca2(RA) by dim(Ga)CAa  =  dim(RA)Ca2(RA). The matter wave-function normalization satisfies at one loop

[formula]

Now we write eq.(1) as:

[formula]

Here δ(2)a is the "second order" correction; integration of (2) using the one-loop expression for α(μ) gives, for scales μ > MSUSY:

[formula]

where εa  =  CGa ln 2 / 2π, and Δa is the string threshold correction [\cite=dkl]:

[formula]

Eq.(3) expresses the result that in first order the running coupling constants approximately "unify " at Planck scale with some string threshold corrections.

Although the result (1) was explicitly derived [\cite=mary] for the [formula] orbifold, its generalization to other ZN orbifolds with ka  =  1 is straightforward. We will also consider the assumption that it can be extended to ka  ≠  1. Here we restrict our analysis to orbifolds with no N = 2 supersymmetry sectors; in this case [\cite=higher]

[formula]

RGE analyses including moduli-dependent threshold corrections have been considered elsewhere [\cite=mod]. The restriction (6) implies a condition [\cite=dkl]-[\cite=mary] on the spectrum of gauge nonsinglets and their modular weights.

For the minimal string model, the above results then give.

[formula]

Here

[formula]

where we have used the first order expression for ln [αa(μs)   /   α(mE)] in the second order terms. The index E extends over extra, massive particles.

[formula]

is the β-function after supersymmetry is broken (we assume two Higgs doublets with mass mH  ≈  MZ), and

[formula]

is the β-function in the supersymmetric region for the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM).

Note that in string phenomenology, the parameters α, MSUSY,  ln (μs / mE), MW are supposed to be determined dynamically. Then the coupling constants at the weak scale can in principle be computed. In addition, according to the most popular supersymmetry breaking mechanism, gaugino condensation [\cite=nilles], MSUSY is determined by the gauge group in the hidden sector. Then eq.(7) implies that low energy measurements can in principle put constraints on both the hidden sector gauge group and the observable gauge group. Unfortunately, there is not as yet a satisfactory theory of supersymmetry breaking by hidden gaugino condensation; we will use the phenomenological constraint that MSUSY must be within about an order of magnitude of a TeV, and define MT  =  1TeV as the "first order" SUSY breaking scale.

We first consider the case ka = 1; presently most string models produced are of this kind. We note that the result (3) was obtained [\cite=mary] from the analysis of the one-loop chiral anomaly, which is connected by supersymmetry to the conformal anomaly, in the context of supergravity. In the context of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, the authors of Ref. [\cite=susy] argue that the two-loop condition (3) should be valid to all loop orders; their argument is related to the well-known result that the chiral anomaly is determined completely at the one loop level. We therefore minimize the approximations in the evaluation of (3); specifically, we do not use the lowest order expression for ln [null]. In addition to the one-loop approximation used in writing the last term in (4), we make the following approximations. We use the lowest order expression for ln [null] to evaluate α(MSUSY). This gives, using LEP data [\cite=data] and other results [\cite=lang]:

[formula]

where the quantities

[formula]

include the two-loop corrections as obtained in this approximation. We used as input the values quoted in [\cite=lang], but with a larger error (δα- 13  =    ±  .79) on αs which covers the slightly higher recent result [\cite=data3]. We then evaluate (3) taking μ  =  MSUSY, and approximating [formula], which is justified by the assumption .1 < MSUSY / MT  <  10,    |z|  ≤  .37, and ln αa(μs)  =   ln α, which is justified (for ka = 1) under our weak coupling assumption: α- 1  ≫  εa  =  (0,.22,.33). This gives:

[formula]

[formula]

where η  =    ±  1 is the sign of δα- 13.

We are interested in finding constraints on string phenomenology from low energy measurements. We write (9) in the form:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

These equations have no solution for Πa = 0. In this case the analysis reduces to that of MSSM which has been done [\cite=data1] to second order and gives: [formula]GeV and αGUT≃26. In string coupling constant unification, we have an additional constraint: αGUTmP  =  MGUT  =  μs, which cannot be satisfied.

However, the universal anomaly cancellation condition (6) generally requires the existence of additional particles, so we expect Πa  ≠  0. Since Πa  ≥  0, if we impose the constraint |z|  ≤  .37, each of eqs. (11)-(13) gives an upper bound on α- 1; the strongest bound is from (11):

[formula]

(Note that although the first term on the right hand side of (4) is not strictly speaking of second order, this bound, together with the weak field assumption α  ≤  1 assures that it, as well as the threshold correction εa, is comparable to the second order corrections.)

Next consider the difference

[formula]

using the weak coupling constraint α  ≤  1. This tells us that for this kind of model to work, at least one extra SU(3) triplet is required. Note that (15) is independent of k1, so our analysis excludes the 3-generation SU(3)  ×  SU(2)  ×  U(1) model of [\cite=font], which is a level one model with no extra SU(3) triplets. For general orbifold compactifications based on the heterotic string, the chiral multiplets in the observable sector are in [formula] of E6. The massive states come in particle-anti-particle pairs that we denote according to their (SU(3)c  ×  SU(2)L)|Q| quantum numbers (Q= electric charge) as

[formula]

Then

[formula]

where ni is the number of pairs with mass Mi. Using the first order expressions for the β-function constants bia, Eq.(8), gives

[formula]

[formula]

Writing

[formula]

[formula]

gives a stronger bound on α:

[formula]

Using the weak coupling constraint, we can also exclude models in which the heavy states all transform as (3,1)  +  (,1)  +  (1,2):

[formula]

[formula]

for α  ≤  1. In addition we get, using (18),

[formula]

[formula]

which in turn implies that [formula] states do not make the full contribution to Π3. Using (18) and α  ≤  1, together with the above results, gives

[formula]

[formula]

The above bounds have implications for the masses of these states; assuming that Πq is dominated by the lightest multiplet, we find, for example

[formula]

Clearly the lower mass range is ruled out; if the upper bound on Πq is saturated, we require nq  ≥  2, which in turn implies mq  ≥  2.8  ×  109GeV. The value found for Πd  +  Πu is has to be interpreted in terms of a lower bound on the number of these states: nu + nd  ≥  2. If the upper bound on Πd  +  Πu is saturated, we require nu + nd  ≥  5; the corresponding mass bounds are

[formula]

Finally, we consider models with arbitrary levels: ka  ≥  1. Although no minimal string model with a higher Kac-Moody level has as yet been constructed, the basic technique has already been established [\cite=level], and there seems to be no fundamental difficulty in obtaining such a model. If the low energy effective theory differs from the ka  =  1 case only by the additional factors k in the couplings of the gauge supermultiplets to the dilaton s, then eq.(3) should still be valid. There is an additional threshold-like effect from the last term in (4): ln αb(μs)  =   ln α  -   ln kb.

If the model is clever enough, it may be possible to achieve universal anomaly cancellation without extra particles. We will only consider this more restrictive case; then the low energy measurements constrain the values of k1,k2 and k3. First we note that for models that unify to a larger gauge group at the string scale, α- 11  =  α- 12  =  α- 13  =  kα- 1, we would have the constraint: MGUT  =  μs  =  kαGUTmP  ≥  αGUTmP, which cannot be satisfied without additional particles or nontrivial string threshold corrections or both. For the models we are considering, which do not have nontrivial string threshold corrections, extra SU(3) triplets are again required for a model to work.

Setting Πa  =  0 eqs.(11)-(13) now appear as:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

If ln ka  ~  1, the additional correction is of same order as the uncertainty in the SUSY threshold. Using the constraints - .37  ≤  α ln α  ≤  0 for 0  ≤  α  ≤  1 and |z|  ≤  .37, (25) and (26) give

[formula]

if we restrict the integers 1  ≤  k2,k3  ≤  10. This allows for the possibility k2  =  2,  k3 = 1; however, the solution to (25) and (26) with these values gives 9.5  ≤  α- 1  ≤  12, MSUSY  ≤  3GeV, which is excluded. For fixed k3 / k2 = 2 and k2α- 1  ≥  4.2, z decreases as k2 increases, so there is no solution with k3 / k2  =  2; in a similar way one can exclude the cases [formula] We find solutions with k2  =  5,  k3  =  7, 3  ≤  α- 1  ≤  4.6, 4.1  ≤  k1  ≤  4.7, - 1.3  ≤  z  ≤  .8, and with k2  =  6,  k3  =  8, 3  ≤  α- 1  ≤  4.7, 4.8  ≤  k1  ≤  5.3, - .59  ≤  z  ≤  2, which cover the allowed range for MSUSY, and are the only solutions with k3 / k2  =  7 / 4 and 4 / 3, respectively. In addition we find that k2  =  2,  k3  =  3, α- 1  ≈  9.3,  k1  ≈  1.8, and k2  =  4,  k3  =  6, α- 1  ≈  4.5,  k1  ≈  4, are allowed within the errors but with marginally acceptable values for z: MSUSY  ≥  7.15TeV in the first case and MSUSY  ≤  140GeV in the second case; these are the only solutions with k3 / k2  =  3 / 2.

True coupling constant unification with ka = 1 is of course the most attractive possibility. The relation between the coupling and the scale at unification in orbifold compactification is inconsistent with the values determined [\cite=data1] from a fit of the MSSM to the data. This could be evaded without introducing extra particles in several ways. In Calabi-Yau compactification, it is generally assumed that the unification scale is determined by the vacuum expectation value of a modulus field t rather than the dilaton s, in which case the relation between the coupling constant and the unification scale would not hold. Since these theories have not been studied to the same extent as orbifold models, no conclusion can really be drawn. Another possibility is that the MSSM is valid to the scale of 1016GeV, above which there is a larger gauge group; in this case nothing can be inferred from the data on the value of α  =  m2s / m2P. A third alternative is orbifold models with moduli-dependent threshold corrections [\cite=mod]. However in theses models, the moduli-dependence of the effective potential for gaugino condensation [\cite=pot] breaks the continuous symmetries that would otherwise protect [\cite=bg] scalar particles from acquiring large masses when local supersymmetry is broken. For this reason, models with universal anomaly cancellation may be more attractive for phenomenology. We have seen that these models can fit the data, which in turn provide restrictions on the spectrum of heavy gauge nonsinglet supermultiplets; in particular, there must be color triplet (3,1) and (3,2) states. Some of these could be light enough to be produced in collider experiments, and, for a suitable mass range, these states could have interesting implications for proton stability and/or baryogenesis. A similar analysis including moduli-dependent threshold corrections and extended gauge groups will be given elsewhere.
