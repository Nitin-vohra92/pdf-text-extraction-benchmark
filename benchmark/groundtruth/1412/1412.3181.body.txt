A Digital Binomial Theorem

Introduction

It is well known that Sierpinski's triangle can be obtained from Pascal's triangle by evaluating its entries, known as binomial coefficients, mod 2:

[formula]

Pascla's triangle is, of course, constructed by inserting the binomial coefficient [formula] in the k-th position of the n-th row, where the first row and first element in each row correspond to n = 0 and k = 0, respectively. Binomial coefficients have a distinguished history and appear in the much-celebrated Binomial Theorem:

[formula]

where [formula] are defined in terms of factorials:

[formula]

In this article, we demonstrate how the Binomial Theorem in turn arises from a one-parameter generalization of the Sierpinski triangle. The connection between them is given by the sum-of-digits function, s(k), defined as the sum of the digits in the binary representation of k (see [\cite=AS]). For example, s(3) = s(1  ·  21 + 1  ·  20) = 2. Towards this end, we begin with a well-known matrix formulation of Sierpinski's triangle that demonstrates its fractal nature (see [\cite=S], p.246). Define a sequence of matrices Sn of size 2n  ×  2n recursively by

[formula]

and

[formula]

for n > 1. Here, the operation [formula] denotes the Kronecker product of two matrices. For example, S2 and S3 can be computed as follows:

[formula]

Thus, in the limit we obtain Sierpinski's matrix S =  lim n  →    ∞Sn.

Less well-known is a one-parameter generalization of Sierpinski's triangle in terms of the sum-of-digits function due to Callan [\cite=C]. If we define

[formula]

and

[formula]

for n > 1, then

[formula]

Observe that Sn(1) = Sn and S(1) = S. The matrix S(x) appears in [\cite=C] where Callan defines its entries in terms of the sum-of-digits function s(k). In particular, if we denote S(x) = (sj,k) and assume the indices j,k to be non-negative with (j,l) = (0,0) corresponding to the top left-most entry, then the entries sj,k are defined by

[formula]

where the notion of carry-free is defined as follows: call a pair of non-negative integers (a,b) carry-free if their sum a + b involves no carries when the addition is performed in binary. For example, the pair (8,2) is carry-free since 8 + 2 = (1  ·  23 + 0  ·  22 + 0  ·  21 + 0  ·  20) + (1  ·  21) = 10 involves no carries in binary.

To see why ([\ref=eq:formula-for-entries-S(x)]) correctly describes ([\ref=eq:generalized-Sierpinski-matrix]), we argue by induction. Clearly, S1(x) satisfies ([\ref=eq:formula-for-entries-S(x)]). Next, assume that Sn(x) satisfies ([\ref=eq:formula-for-entries-S(x)]). It suffices to show that every entry sj,k of Sn + 1(x) satisfies ([\ref=eq:formula-for-entries-S(x)]). To prove this, we divide Sn + 1(x), whose size is 2n + 1  ×  2n + 1, into four sub-matrices A,B,C,D, each of size 2n  ×  2n, based on the recurrence

[formula]

where A = D = Sn(x), B = 0, and C = xSn(x). We now consider four cases depending on which sub-matrix the element sj,k belongs to.

Case 1: 0  ≤  j,k  ≤  2n - 1. Then sj,k lies in A = Sn(x) and thus ([\ref=eq:formula-for-entries-S(x)]) clearly holds.

Case 2: 0  ≤  j  ≤  2n - 1, 2n  ≤  k  ≤  2n + 1 - 1. Then sj,k lies in B = 0, which implies sj,k = 0, and thus ([\ref=eq:formula-for-entries-S(x)]) holds since k  ≥  j.

Case 3: 2n  ≤  j,k  ≤  2n + 1 - 1. Then sj,k lies in D = Sn(x). Let

[formula]

denote their binary expansions. Observe that jn = kn = 1. Define j' = j - 2n and k' = k - 2n where we delete the digit jn from j (resp. kn from k). Then it is clear that (k,j - k) being carry-free is equivalent to (k',j' - k') being carry-free. Moreover, s(j - k) = s(j' - k'). We conclude that

[formula]

satisfies ([\ref=eq:formula-for-entries-S(x)]).

Case 4: 2n  ≤  j  ≤  2n + 1 - 1, 0  ≤  k  ≤  2n - 1. Then sj,k lies in C = xSn(x). Define j' = j - 2n and k' = k. Then again (k,j - k) being carry-free is equivalent to (k',j' - k') being carry-free. Also, s(j - k) = s(2n + j' - k') = 1 + s(j' - k'). Hence,

[formula]

satisfies ([\ref=eq:formula-for-entries-S(x)]) as well. This complete the proof.

Callan also proved in the same paper that S(x) generates a one-parameter group, i.e., it satisfies the following additive property under matrix multiplication:

[formula]

We will see that this property encodes a digital version of the Binomial Theorem. For example, equating the (3,0)-entry of S(x + y), i.e. s3,0, with the corresponding entry of S(x)S(y) yields the identity

[formula]

which simplifies to the Binomial Theorem for n = 2:

[formula]

The identities corresponding to the (5,0) and (7,0)-entries of S(x + y) are

[formula]

and

[formula]

respectively. Observe that ([\ref=eq:digit-binomial-theorem-m=5]) is equivalent to ([\ref=eq:sum-of-digit-expansion-n=2]) while ([\ref=eq:digit-binomial-theorem-m=7]) simplifies to the Binomial Theorem for n = 3.

More generally, property ([\ref=eq:additive-property]) can be restated as a digital version of the Binomial Theorem:

Let [formula]. Then

[formula]

We note that ([\ref=eq:digital-binomial-theorem-carry-free]) appears implicitly in Callan's proof of ([\ref=eq:additive-property]). The rest of this article is devoted to proving Theorem [\ref=th:digital-binomial-theorem] independently of ([\ref=eq:additive-property]) and demonstrating that it is equivalent to the Binomial Theorem when m = 2n - 1.

Proof of the Digital Binomial Theorem

There are many known proofs of the Binomial Theorem. The standard combinatorial proof relies on enumerating n-element permutations that contain the symbols x and y and then counting those permutations that contain k copies of x. For example, the expansion

[formula]

gives all 2-element permutations that contain x and y. Then the number of permutations that contain k copies of x is given by [formula]. Thus, ([\ref=eq:binomial-expansion-n=2-permutation]) corresponds to ([\ref=eq:binomial-theorem]) with n = 2:

[formula]

To establish that ([\ref=eq:binomial-theorem-n=2]) is equivalent to ([\ref=eq:sum-of-digit-expansion-n=2]), we consider the following digital binomial expansion: given two sets of digits, S0  =  {x0,y0} and S1  =  {x1,y1}, we can represent all ways of constructing a 2-digit number z0z1, where z0∈S0 and z1∈S1, by the expansion

[formula]

which we rewrite as

[formula]

If we now assume that x0 = x1 = x and y0 = y1 = y, then each term on the right-hand side of ([\ref=eq:digit-expansion-n=2-part2]) has the form

[formula]

where k = d020 + d121 and 3 - k = (1 - d0)20 + (1 - d1)21. It follows that ([\ref=eq:digit-expansion-n=2-part2]) reduces to ([\ref=eq:sum-of-digit-expansion-n=2]). On the other hand, ([\ref=eq:digit-expansion-n=2]) reduces to ([\ref=eq:binomial-expansion-n=2-permutation]). Thus, we have shown that Theorem [\ref=th:digital-binomial-theorem] for m = 3 is equivalent to the Binomial Theorem for n = 2.

To extend the proof to integers of the form m = 2n - 1, we consider n sets of digits, Sk  =  {xk,yk}, where [formula]. The expansion

[formula]

represents all ways of constructing an n-digit number [formula] with zk∈Sk for [formula]. Then substituting xk = x and yk = y for all such k into ([\ref=eq:digital-binomial-expansion]) yields

[formula]

or equivalently,

[formula]

where if we define [formula], then [formula] and

[formula]

Moreover, k ranges from 0 to 2n - 1 since [formula]. This justifies Theorem 1. On the other hand, given k between 0 and n, the number of permutations [formula] containing k 1's is equal to [formula]. Thus, ([\ref=eq:digital-binomial-expansion-part-2]) reduces to ([\ref=eq:binomial-theorem]). This proves that Theorem 1 is equivalent to the Binomial Theorem.

To complete the proof of Theorem 1 for any non-negative integer m, we first expand m in binary:

[formula]

where we only record its 1's digits so that mik = 1 for all [formula]. Then [formula]. Just as before, we use the expansion ([\ref=eq:digital-binomial-expansion]) to derive ([\ref=eq:digital-binomial-expansion-part-2]), but this time we rewrite ([\ref=eq:digital-binomial-expansion-part-2]) as

[formula]

where we define

[formula]

Then [formula] and since mik = 1 for all [formula], we have

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

Moreover, it is clear that 0  ≤  k  ≤  m and (k,m - k) is carry-free. Conversely, every non-negative integer k with (k,m - k) carry-free must have representation in the form ([\ref=eq:k-expansion]); otherwise, the sum k + (m - k) requires a carry in any non-zero digit of k where the corresponding digit of m in the same position is zero. Thus, Theorem 1 holds for any non-negative integer m.

To complete our story we explain why Sierpinski's triangle appears in the reduction of Pascal's triangle's mod 2 by relating binomial coefficients with the sum-of-digits function. Define the carry function c(n,k) to be the number of carries needed to add k and n - k in binary. A theorem of Kummer's (see [\cite=G]) tells us that the p-adic valuation of binomial coefficients is given by the carry function.

Let p be a prime integer. Then the largest power of p that divides [formula] equals c(n,k).

Kummer's theorem now explains the location of 0's and 1's in Sierpinski's triangle, assuming that its entries are defined by

[formula]

Let p = 2. If (k,n - k) is carry free, then c(n,k)=0 and therefore the largest power of 2 dividing [formula] is 20 = 1. In other words, [formula] is odd and hence, sn,k = 0. On the other hand, if (k,n - k) is not carry-free, then c(n,k)  ≥  1 and so the largest power of 2 dividing [formula] is at least 1. Therefore, [formula] is even and hence, sj,k = 0. This proves that definition ([\ref=eq:Sierpinski-triangle-mod-2]) for Sierpinski's triangle is equivalent to definition ([\ref=eq:formula-for-entries-S(x)]) in terms of carry-free pairs with x = 1.

Lastly, it is known that the failure of the sum-of-digits function to be additive is characterized by the carry function. In particular, we have (see [\cite=BEJ])

[formula]

It follows that (k,n - k) is carry-free if and only if s(k) + s(n - k) = s(n). Thus, it is fitting that the Digital Binomial Theorem can be restated purely in terms of the additivity of the sum-of-digits function:
