On Hamiltonian minimal submanifolds in the space of oriented geodesics in real space forms

Introduction

The space [formula] of oriented geodesics of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold (M,g) has been of great interest for the last three decades and has been studied by different authors (see for example [\cite=AGK],[\cite=An1],[\cite=gag],[\cite=klbg],[\cite=klbg1],[\cite=hitch],[\cite=salvai0],[\cite=salvai]). When (M,g) is a Riemannian symmetric space of rank one, Alekseevsky, Guilfoyle and Kligenberg have described in [\cite=AGK] all possible metrics defined on [formula] that are invariant under the isometry group of g.

In the case where (M,g) is a real (n + 1)-dimensional space form [formula] of signature (p,n + 1 - p) with constant sectional curvature one, Anciaux has showed in [\cite=An1] that [formula] admits a Kähler or a para-Kähler structure [formula], where [formula] is the complex or paracomplex structure and Ω is the symplectic structure such that the metric G is Einstein and is invariant under the isometry group of g. In the same work, for n = 2, Anciaux has proved that [formula] admits an extra Kähler or para-Kähler structure [formula], where [formula] is the complex or paracomplex structure, such that the invariant metric G' is of neutral signature, locally conformally flat and is invariant under the isometry group of g.

The submanifold theory of [formula] gives some interesting informations about the submanifold theory of M. For example, the normal congruence (or Gauss map) of a one-parameter family of parallel hypersurfaces in M is a Lagrangian submanifold (the induced symplectic structure identically) of the corresponding space of geodesics (see for example [\cite=An1]). In particular, the normal congruence L(Σ) of a Weingarten surface Σ in [formula] (its principal curvatures are functionally related) is flat with respect to the metric G' induced on L(Σ) [\cite=An1].

Let (M,J,g,ω) be a (para-) Kähler manifold and let φ:Σ  →  M be a Lagrangian immersion. A normal vector field X is called Hamiltonian if [formula], where J is the (para-) complex structure and [formula] is the gradient of u∈C∞(Σ) with respect to the non-degenerate induced metric [formula]. We say that a variation (φt) of φ is a Hamiltonian variation if its velocity X = ∂t|t = 0φt is a Hamiltonian vector field with the additional condition that the function u is compactly supported. The Lagrangian immersion φ is said to be Hamiltonian minimal or H-minimal if it is a critical point of the volume functional with respect to Hamiltonian variations. The first variation formula of the volume functional implies that a Hamiltonian minimal submanifold is characterised by the equation JH = 0, where H denotes the mean curvature vector of φ and div is the divergence operator with respect to the induced metric [\cite=Oh1]. Further study of H-minimal submanifolds can be found at the following articles [\cite=BC] [\cite=JLS] [\cite=Lee] [\cite=Oh2].

Palmer showed in [\cite=Palmer1] that a smooth variation of a hypersurface in the sphere [formula] induces a Hamiltonian variation of the Gauss map in [formula]. An analogue result for the 3-dimensional Euclidean space [formula] has been shown by Anciaux, Guilfoyle and Romon in [\cite=AGR]. Following similar computations that Palmer used in [\cite=Palmer1], we prove that any smooth variation of a hypersurface in the real space form [formula] induces a Hamiltonian variation in the symplectic manifold [formula]. In particular we prove the following:

Let φt, t∈( - ε,ε) be a smooth one-parameter deformation of an immersion φ: = φt = 0, of the n-dimensional oriented manifold Σ in the real space form [formula]. Then, the corresponding Gauss maps Φt form a Hamiltonian variaton with respect to the symplectic manifold [formula].

Anciaux, Guilfoyle and Romon have proved in [\cite=AGR] that a Hamiltonian minimal surface in [formula] (resp. [formula]) is the Gauss map of a surface S in [formula] (resp. [formula]) which is a critical point of the functional [formula], where H and K denote the mean curvature and the Gauss curvature, respectively. In this article we extend this result for the case of the space [formula] of oriented geodesics in a (n + 1)-dimensional real space form. In particular, we consider the (para-) Kähler Einstein structure [formula] and the locally conformally flat (para-) Kähler structure [formula] both endowed on [formula]. Then, as an application of Theorem [\ref=t:theo1], we prove the following:

Let [formula] be a real diagonalizable hypersurface in [formula] and let Φ be the Gauss map of φ. Then, away of umbilic points, we have the following statements:

(i) The Gauss map Φ is a Hamiltonian minimal submanifold with respect to the (para-)Kähler Einstein structure [formula] if and only if the immersion φ is a critical point of the functional

[formula]

where [formula] are the principal curvatures of φ and ε denotes the length of the normal vector field of φ.

(ii) For n = 2, the Gauss map Φ is a Hamiltonian minimal surface in [formula] if and only if the surface φ is a critical point of the functional

[formula]

where k1,k2 denote the principal curvatures of φ.

Preliminaries

For n  ≥  1, consider the Euclidean space [formula] endowed with the canonical pseudo-Riemannian metric of signature (p,n + 2 - p), where 0  ≤  p  ≤  n + 2:

[formula]

Define the (n + 1)-dimensional real space form

[formula]

and let [formula] be the canonical inclusion. The induced metric [formula] has signature (p,n + 1 - p) and is of constant sectional curvature K = 1.

Following the notations of [\cite=An1] we denote by [formula] (resp. [formula]) the set of spacelike (resp. timelike) oriented geodesics of [formula], that is,

[formula]

where ε = 1 (resp. ε =  - 1) corresponds to [formula] (resp. [formula]). If [formula] is equipped with the flat pseudo-Riemannian metric:

[formula]

we denote by G the metric [formula] induced by the inclusion map [formula]. On the other hand, in [formula] can be defined a complex (paracomplex) structure [formula] as follows:

Let J be the canonical complex (paracomplex) structure in the oriented plane [formula] defined by Jx = y and Jy =  - εx. Thus, J2 =  - εId. A tangent vector to [formula] at the point [formula] is of the form [formula], where [formula] in [formula]. The complex (paracomplex) structure [formula] is defined by:

[formula]

The metric G and the (para) complex structure [formula] are invariant under the natural action of the isometry group of [formula]. For n  ≥  3, it has been showed in [\cite=AGK] that G is the unique invariant metric under the natural action of SO(n + 2 - p,p).

The 2-form Ω defined by [formula], is a symplectic structure on [formula] and in particular:

[\cite=An1] The quadraple [formula] is a 2n-dimensional Kähler manifold with signature (2p,2n - 2p), while [formula] is a 2n-dimensional para-Kähler manifold. In both cases, the metric G is Einstein with constant scalar curvature S = 2εn2.

We now consider the case of [formula]. The orthogonal [formula] of an oriented plane [formula], is also a plane in [formula] and is oriented in such a way its orientation is combatible with the orientation of the plane [formula]. Then it is possible to define a canonical complex or paracomplex structure J', depending of whether the metric [formula] induced on [formula] is positive or indefinite. In this case, we may define a complex or paracomplex structure [formula] on [formula] by

[formula]

The pseudo-Riemannian metric G' on [formula] is given by:

[formula]

Furthermore,

[\cite=An1] The quadraples [formula] are 4-dimensional (para-) Kähler manifolds. The metric G' is of neutral signature (2,2), scalar flat, locally conformally flat and is invariant under the natural action of SO(4 - p,p).

Let [formula] be an immersion of a n-dimensional orientable manifold into the real space form [formula] and let N be the unit normal vector of the hypersurface S = φ(Σ). The set S̄ of geodesics that are orthogonal to S, oriented in the direction of N, is called the normal congruence or the Gauss map of S. Then,

[\cite=An1] Let φ be an immersion of an orientable manifold Σn in [formula] with unit normal vector field N. Then the Gauss map of S = φ(Σ) is the image of the map [formula] defined by [formula]. When Φ is an immersion, it is Lagrangian. Conversely, let [formula] be an immersion of a simply connected n-manifold. Then S̄: = Φ(Σ) is the Gauss map of an immersed hypersurface of [formula] if and only if Φ is Lagrangian.

Hamiltonian minimal submanifolds

Throughout the article, when we talk about hypersurfaces in [formula] or about Lagrangian submanifolds in [formula], we mean that the induced metric is non-degenerate.

Hamiltonian variations in [formula]

Consider the 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold [formula], where [formula] denotes the space of oriented geodesics in the real space form [formula]. Then we prove our first main result:

Proof of Theorem [\ref=t:theo1]: Let [formula], where t∈( - t0,t0) for some t0 > 0, be a smooth variation of an immersion [formula] of an oriented n-dimensional manifold Σ in [formula]. Let St: = φt(Σ) be the hypersurfaces of [formula] and S: = φ(Σ).

We denote by Nt the 1-parameter family of vector fields such that N0 = N and [formula]. Following the notation of [\cite=Palmer1], there exist a smooth function f on S and a smooth section Y of the tangent bundle TS such that

[formula]

where [formula]. Derivating the expression [formula] with respect to t at t = 0, we have

[formula]

Then, it yields

[formula]

where [formula]. For Xt∈TSt, where X0: = X∈TS, we also derive with respect to t the expression [formula] at t = 0, and we obtain

[formula]

which finally gives

[formula]

Let [formula] be the Gauss map of the immersion [formula]. If X̄: = dΦ(X), from [\cite=An1], we have that

[formula]

Let [formula] be the velocity of the variation Φt and write [formula], where [formula] and [formula] denote the tangential and the normal component of [formula] respectively. Then,

[formula]

which implies that

[formula]

and this completes the Theorem. [formula]

Applications

A real diagonalizable immersion is a smooth immersion φ of a hypersurface Σn into the (n+1)-dimensional real space form [formula] such that, locally, the shape operator A can be diagonalized, that is, it is existed a local orthonormal frame [formula] and real functions [formula] where, [formula]. In this case, each vector field ei is called a principal direction with corresponded principal curvature ki.

Note that every hypersurface in the Riemannian case, away of umbilic points, is real diagonalizable.

We are now in position to prove our second result:

Proof of Theorem [\ref=c:cor1]: Consider a smooth immersion of φ of the n-dimensional manifold Σ in [formula] and let [formula] be the corresponded Gauss map. The fact that φ is real diagonalizable implies the existence of an orthonormal frame [formula], with respect to the induced metric [formula], such that

[formula]

where A denotes the shape operator of φ. Let (φt)t∈( - t0,t0) be a smooth variation of φ and (Φt) be the corresponded variation of the Gauss map Φ. Real diagonalizability implies that the minimal polynomial of A is the product of distinct linear factors. Using the fact that the variation (Φt) is at least C1-smooth, it is possible to obtain a positive real number t1 < t0 such that φt is real diagonalizable for every t∈( - t1,t1). We may extend all extrinsic geometric quantities such as the shape operator A, the principal directions ei and the principal curvatures ki to the 1-parameter family of immersions (φt).

(i) From [\cite=An1], the induced metric [formula] is given by [formula] and thus,

[formula]

where εi = g(ei,ei). For every sufficiently small t > 0, the volume of every Gauss map Φt, with respect to the metric G, is

[formula]

If φ is a critical point of the functional W, we have

[formula]

for any Hamiltonian variation of Φ. Therefore, Φ is a Hamiltonian minimal submanifold with respect to the Kähler Einstein structure (G,J). The converse follows directly from ([\ref=e:impeqt]).

(ii) Assume that n = 2. From [\cite=An1], in terms of the orthonormal frame (e1,e2), the induced metric [formula] is

[formula]

where [formula]. Then, the volume of every Gauss map Φt, with respect to the metric G', is

[formula]

and thus the second statement of the Theorem follows by a similar argument with the proof of the first statement. [formula]

Let [formula] be a hypersurface and N denotes the unit normal vector field. For [formula], consider the immersion φθ: =  cos ε(θ)φ  +   sin ε(θ)N, where ε: = |N|2 and ( cos ε(θ), sin ε(θ)) = ( cos θ, cos θ) if ε = 1 while for ε =  - 1 we have ( cos ε(θ), sin ε(θ)) = ( cosh θ, cosh θ). The images φθ(Σ) and φ(Σ) are called parallel hypersurfaces. It is important to mention that parallel hypersurfaces have the same Gauss map [\cite=An1].

Looking more carefully the relations ([\ref=e:impeqt]) and ([\ref=e:impeqt1]) we obtain the following symmetry for the functionals W and W':

If φ1 and φ2 are parallel smooth real diagonalizable immersions of the n-manifold Σ in [formula] then W(φ1) = W(φ2). In the case where n = 2, we also have that W'(φ1) = W'(φ2).

Using the Einstein (para-) Kähler structure [formula] we obtain the following Corollary:

Let [formula] be a real diagonalizable hypersurface and let [formula] be the principal curvatures. If Φ is the Gauss map of φ, then the function [formula] is harmonic with respect to the induced metric [formula] if and only if φ is a critical point of the functional [formula].

Let Φ be the Gauss map of φ and consider the Einstein (para-) Kähler structure (G,J). Then , from [\cite=An1], we know that the mean curvature [formula] of Φ is given by

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the Levi-Civita connection of the induced metric [formula]. Then, the Corollary follows by the following relation,

[formula]

where div and Δ denote the divergence operator and the Laplacian of [formula].

Using the Remark [\ref=r:rem], we obtain the following two Corollaries:

Let [formula] be a hypersurface in the sphere [formula]. Then the Gauss map Φ is a Hamiltonian minimal submanifold in the (para-) Kähler Einstein structure [formula] if and only if the hypersurface φ is a critical point of the functional [formula], where [formula] are the principal curvatures of φ.

Let [formula] be a surface in the sphere [formula]. Then the Gauss map Φ is a Hamiltonian minimal submanifold with respect to the Kähler, conformally flat structure [formula] if and only if the surface φ is a critical point of the functional [formula] [formula], where H,K denote the mean and the Gauss curvature of φ.
