Effects of neutrino rest mass on and ionization equilibrium freeze-out

In this Letter we describe mechanisms in which the rest masses of neutrinos affect the observationally-inferred value of , a parameter related to the radiation energy density at photon decoupling. The microphysics in the early universe which determines in standard cosmology is a well studied issue [\cite=1999NuPhB.543..269D] [\cite=1982NuPhB.209..372C] [\cite=1999PhRvD..59j3502L] [\cite=Mangano.2002PhLB534] [\cite=2010JCAP...05..037S] [\cite=Hou.2013PhRvD..87h3008H] [\cite=Birrell.PhysRevD.89.023008]. However, the way in which neutrino rest mass influences is counterintuitive.

The theoretical definition of arises from a parametrization of radiation energy density, [formula], in terms of the photon temperature at decoupling, Tγ, given by:

[formula]

(We set [formula] throughout this work.) We adorn with a superscript [formula] to distinguish the theory version of from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) inferred value of described below. Calculations which include non-equilibrium processes in the early universe suggest [formula] [\cite=1982NuPhB.209..372C] [\cite=1999NuPhB.543..269D] [\cite=1999PhRvD..59j3502L] [\cite=Mangano.2002PhLB534].

Since active neutrinos decouple from the plasma with ultra-relativistic kinematics, their energy densities do not behave like Fermi-Dirac distributions at photon decoupling. The energy density of neutrinos with rest masses mνi and neutrino temperature Tν is:

[formula]

where the sum is over active neutrino mass eigenstates, νi and the second expression follows from an assumption of decoupled neutrinos. With this assumption, the behavior of the neutrino energy density is a sum of ultra-relativistic Fermi-Dirac occupation probabilities, fν  =  ( exp (p  /  Tν)  +  1)- 1, but with a general energy dispersion relation, [formula]. Therefore, the energy density in the presence of a massive-neutrino species is larger than in the massless case.

The best cosmological constraint (at the level of 2σ) on the sum of the light neutrino masses is [formula] eV [\cite=2013arXiv1303.5076P]. If we take to be at this upper limit and assume degenerate mass eigenvalues, each neutrino has an associated mass [formula]. We see that the neutrino rest masses and temperatures at photon decoupling ([formula], [formula]) are coincidentally at the same scale, meaning that neutrinos can not be treated either as pure matter or pure radiation. An individual neutrino has an average momentum of [formula] at photon decoupling. As a consequence, we expect fractional corrections to the relativistic neutrino energy density stemming from neutrino rest mass to be ~  m2 / 2p2  ~  0.01, with a concomitant change to of [formula]. If we were to unphysically classify the entire neutrino energy density into [formula] the corresponding change to would be [formula]. We arrive then at [formula] for [formula], a change consistent with the simple kinematic estimate above, and not to be confused with [formula] stemming from non-equilibrium neutrino scattering and quantum electrodynamic effects inherent in Refs.[\cite=1999NuPhB.543..269D] [\cite=1982NuPhB.209..372C] [\cite=1999PhRvD..59j3502L].

The radiation energy density is not directly measured by observation of the CMB. Consequently, we distinguish between in Eq.[\eqref=eqn:baby_formula] and a measure of radiation energy density inferred from observations, which we shall term . We determine by computing the sound horizon, rs and the photon diffusion length, rd at the photon decoupling epoch in the manner described below.

The quantities rs and rd are given in terms of integrals over the scale factor a [\cite=2013arXiv1303.5076P]:

[formula]

where H = H(a) is the Hubble expansion rate, σT is the Thomson cross section, ne(a) is the free-electron number density, and [formula] is a ratio involving the baryon rest mass and photon energy densities, ρb and ργ, respectively. The integrals span the early history of the universe, ending at [formula], the epoch of photon decoupling at a redshift z  =  1090.43 [\cite=2013arXiv1303.5076P]. In the analysis to follow, we ignore the small dependence of the value of [formula] on . This is not entirely self-consistent but we will demonstrate that a consistent treatment changes the decoupling redshift from z = 1090 to z = 1091. The associated change in [formula] has negligible effect on rs and rd; this is similar to the finding in Ref.[\cite=Hou.2013PhRvD..87h3008H]. We should note that Eq.[\eqref=eqn:rd] is approximate and a more complete analysis would include effects beyond the tight-coupling approximation[\cite=Hu.1996ApJ.471.542H].

Using Eq.[\eqref=eqn:rho_nu] with neutrino masses taken as described above for a given value of and the known relations for ργ and ρb we compute the quantities rs and rd from Eqs.[\eqref=eqn:rs] and [\eqref=eqn:rd], respectively. We choose in Eq.[\eqref=eqn:baby_formula] to reproduce this ratio of rs / rd, which is a monotonically decreasing function of . The quantity so determined is termed and it reduces to for massless neutrinos. It has been motivated here by the need to characterize massive neutrinos but it is applicable to non-standard cosmic constituents that may have non-equilibrium distributions. Using the ratio rs / rd in the determination of avoids any reference to the angular diameter distance to last scattering and, therefore, dependence on the dark energy equation of state. In contrast to Ref.[\cite=Hou.2013PhRvD..87h3008H] we do not change the value of the primordial helium abundance, YP to keep θd fixed.

A scaling analysis, similar to that of Ref.[\cite=Hou.2013PhRvD..87h3008H], demonstrates the approximate relation between the sound horizon, the diffusion length, and the Hubble rate. Consider a scale transformation to the Hubble rate, H  →  λH, and the corresponding alteration to rs and rd. If we neglect the dependence of R(a) and ne(a) on λ we have

[formula]

These relations suggest that a larger Hubble rate (λ  >  1) results in a smaller value of the ratio rs / rd. This fact and [formula] (since rs / rd is monotonically decreasing with ) means that a larger Hubble rate would imply a larger value of . In fact, as we will show, the λ-scale dependence of ne(a) leads to the consequence that a larger Hubble rate results in a larger ratio of rs / rd.

The photon diffusion length rd depends on the number density of free electrons ne. To calculate ne, we must follow the competition between ionization and recombination in an expanding universe. The hydrogen contribution to the free-electron fraction, [formula], follows from the Boltzmann equation [\cite=1968ApJ...153....1P] [\cite=1968ZhETF..55..278Z]:

[formula]

where [formula] is the ionization rate and [formula] is the recombination rate. There is a similar Boltzmann equation for the contribution of helium to the free-electron fraction, [formula].

We employ a recombination reaction network that includes hydrogen and helium and which is similar to, but independent of, the code recfast[\cite=1999ApJ...523L...1S]. Figure [\ref=fig:xe_vs_a_0] shows a calculation of the free-electron fraction, [formula], as a function of scale factor ratio a / a0 ([formula] at current epoch), where we have taken [formula]. We neglect effects due to reionization processes at low redshift, z  ~  O(1). We evolve the free-electron fraction through the photon decoupling epoch to show the freeze-out of ionization equilibrium. Note the drop from the initial value of Xe = 1 near a / a0≃2  ×  10- 4. This is a consequence of the recombination onto He III.

Similarly, in Fig. [\ref=fig:xe_vs_a_non] we plot the change in Xe for non-zero values of relative to the case with [formula]. Non-zero has a discernible effect on the freeze-out of Xe. A larger implies a larger Hubble rate which implies an earlier epoch for Xe freeze-out. In a study of the expansion rate during recombination, Ref.[\cite=Zahn.PhysRevD.67.063002] observed that scaling the Hubble rate affects the recombination history. Here we build on this argument to explicitly consider the role of neutrino rest mass on recombination. The curve describing the largest change corresponds to [formula] eV, whereas the smallest change corresponds to [formula] eV. We space consecutive curves ΔΣmν  =  0.2 eV apart. The larger Xe at [formula] produces a smaller rd, opposite to the expectation from Eq.[\eqref=eqn:scaling] based solely on the λ-scale dependence of the Hubble rate.

We simulate the earlier epochs in the history of the universe, i.e. the weak decoupling, weak freeze-out and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) epochs, by using the BURST code [\cite=GFKP-5pts:2014mn]. This self-consistent treatment incorporates the following: binned, general, momenta occupation-probabilities for each of six neutrino species (νe, e, νμ, μ, ντ, and τ); a Boltzmann treatment of neutrino scattering, absorption, and emission processes. In this treatment, neutrinos decouple from the γ, e± plasma at high temperatures, [formula] MeV, ensuring that their kinematics are ultra-relativistic [\cite=2009PhRvL.102t1303F] [\cite=1990bmc..book.....D]. Assuming zero lepton numbers and an adopted world-average neutron lifetime of 886 s, our calculations give a 4He primordial mass fraction YP  =  0.242 taking the baryon number [formula] from the Ref.[\cite=2013arXiv1303.5076P] best-fit. This is consistent with the observationally inferred primordial helium abundance [\cite=Izotov:2010ns] [\cite=2013JCAP...11..017A]. This calculated value of YP is, of course, independent of neutrino rest mass. Although we take the neutrinos to decouple in weak eigenstates, i.e. flavor states, we write their occupation probabilities in the mass eigenbasis. Since we are assuming the neutrinos have identical thermal spectra with zero-chemical potential in the weak eigenstates, we can use the same occupation probabilities for the mass eigenstates at a given momentum p [\cite=2002NuPhB.632..363D] [\cite=2009PhRvL.102t1303F].

Figure [\ref=fig:neff_vs_a_non] shows the evolution of with scale factor. Here for illustrative purposes, we treat [formula] as a quantity to be determined at any epoch, whereas it is only observed at photon decoupling. The neutrino rest mass has no discernible effect on at early epochs, at small a / a0. At larger values of [formula], the extra energy density from the neutrino rest masses produces a larger in accordance with Eq.[\eqref=eqn:scaling] before the neutrino-mass/recombination effect is significant. If we were to extrapolate this evolution trend to the epoch of photon decoupling, we would find a value of [formula]. The neutrino-mass/recombination effect intervenes to modify this extrapolation and results in [formula] at [formula].

Figure [\ref=fig:neff_vs_a_non] shows [formula] computed with the recombination history of the universe for various values of . Each evolution curve for [formula] in Fig. [\ref=fig:neff_vs_a_non] corresponds to an evolution curve for Xe(a) in Fig. [\ref=fig:xe_vs_a_non]. The smallest value of produces the smallest change in Xe, which subsequently changes [formula] the least. Conversely, the largest value of produces the largest change in Xe, which changes [formula] the most. From the curves in Fig. [\ref=fig:neff_vs_a_non], it is clear that the effect of neutrino rest mass in producing a higher Xe at freeze-out overwhelms the effect of the extra energy density, thereby decreasing at photon decoupling, i.e. at [formula], the vertical bar in Figs. [\ref=fig:xe_vs_a_non] & [\ref=fig:neff_vs_a_non].

There are several interesting features to note in Fig. [\ref=fig:neff_vs_a_non]. Each curve in Fig. [\ref=fig:neff_vs_a_non] goes through [formula] near the value [formula]. The larger the value of , the higher the curvature of the function [formula]. For values of a / a0 above [formula], the slope of [formula] is an extremely rapidly decreasing function of . We note that for [formula] eV, the preferred upper limit from Ref.[\cite=2013arXiv1303.5076P], we find [formula]. This effect is certainly below present sensitivities of CMB observations. Next-generation CMB measurements, however, aspire to percent level accuracy in determinations of the relativistic energy density[\cite=Abazajian201566]. The exquisite sensitivity of the neutrino-mass/recombination effect on [formula] suggests that it may be an important component in future precision determinations of cosmological parameters.

As mentioned earlier, we do not constrain [formula] to maintain a uniform optical depth [formula]

[formula]

when comparing different values for . Note that this definition of [formula] does not include reionization effects on ne(a). We should emphasize that each curve in Figs. [\ref=fig:xe_vs_a_non] and [\ref=fig:neff_vs_a_non] is calculated using the same value for the scale factor of last scattering [formula] (corresponding to z = 1090.43). This is not self consistent, strictly speaking, but we have verified that the effect on , due to the differences in ne and H, is negligible. If we impose the constraint in Eq.[\eqref=eqn:opt_depth], we find [formula] decreases by a few parts in 104 for [formula] eV, which has an insignificant effect on .

Up to this point in the present analysis we have not considered variation of the primordial helium mass fraction YP since BBN occurs at high enough temperatures that the neutrinos are effectively massless. If we consider, however, cosmological parameters that affect YP we can examine the dependence of on both and YP simultaneously. A direct way to vary YP is to consider changes to the baryon number . In the range of values of that we're interested in, YP is a monotonically increasing function of .

Figure [\ref=fig:contour_mass] shows a contour plot of [formula] in the versus parameter space; contours correspond to constant values of [formula]. Varying requires new computations of YP from BBN and Xe(a) from recombination. Changing requires a new computation of Xe but no new computation of YP. As a consequence, we compute BBN with the BURST code only once for a given , and compute the recombination history for each pair (, ). Holding fixed, the change in [formula] increases with increasing due to the different recombination histories effecting a change in rd, the diffusion length. Note that the change in rs, the sound horizon, does not completely compensate for the change in rd. The shaded vertical region in Fig. [\ref=fig:contour_mass] is the 1σ range of given by Ref.[\cite=2013arXiv1303.5076P], but we explore a larger range in the parameter space to illustrate the dependence of on and .

An interesting feature of these curves is their increasing curvature with decreasing and increasing . This is a consequence of an enhancement of the neutrino-mass/recombination effect with increasing (or, equivalently, increasing YP): as increases, the change in is faster for higher values of . This is perhaps a surprising result given the form of Eq.[\eqref=eqn:rd] for rd. A scaling of YP would appear to lead to an increase in rd since [formula]. This would, of course, lead to a smaller ratio of rs / rd and therefore a larger , in contradiction to what is revealed in Fig. [\ref=fig:contour_mass]. Numerical computations using our recombination history model show, however, that [formula] is a decreasing function of (or YP) in the range of considered here. This explains the neutrino-mass/recombination enhancement of Fig. [\ref=fig:contour_mass].

We have discussed two ways in which neutrino rest mass affects measurable quantities at photon decoupling. First, neutrino rest mass drives an earlier recombination freeze-out resulting in a higher free-electron fraction. Second, this effect is enhanced with increasing helium abundance stemming from a self-consistently calculated recombination history. As radiation energy density is not a directly measurable quantity, we use observable quantities to indirectly arrive at the radiation energy density. For this purpose, we choose the ratio of the sound horizon to the photon diffusion length. Photon diffusion is sensitive to the recombination history, which requires a Boltzmann-equation treatment. We find a non-trivial evolution of [formula] with scale factor, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:neff_vs_a_non]. Note that the evolution of shown in this figure does not reflect a kinematical evolution of the radiation energy density with a massive component. The trends evidenced in this figure are a consequence of the neutrino-mass/recombination effect.

We note the following two important points to elaborate on this caveat. First, that as defined in Eq.[\eqref=eqn:baby_formula] should not be used to describe the neutrino energy density. It limits neutrinos to pure radiation, which does not accurately describe the neutrino energy density. Second, cosmological neutrinos cannot be described by only using the parameters and . Precision cosmology has the potential to reveal beyond standard-model physics inaccessible in the laboratory [\cite=2014ApJ...794..171T] [\cite=2014SPIE.9153E..1PB]. Given sufficient precision, interpretations of the measurements require a self-consistent treatment of the neutrino physics.

Self-consistency is a primary motivation for defining the radiation energy density parameter in terms of the ratio rs / rd. generalizes the parameter to the massive neutrino case. Further, is defined for arbitrary energy densities and arbitrary distribution functions. Moreover, using a parameter derived directly from observed data characterizes the radiation energy density at photon decoupling in a model independent way.

Depending on , the change in discussed here may be within the sensitivity of the next generation CMB experiments when polarization effects are taken into account[\cite=2013arXiv1303.5076P] [\cite=2014ApJ...794..171T] [\cite=2014SPIE.9153E..1PB] [\cite=Abazajian201566]. CMB precision is planned to be increased to the [formula] level which would probe both massive active neutrinos and other possible components of dark radiation. Scenarios with sterile neutrinos and other very weakly coupled light massive species with masses larger than those associated with the active neutrinos could enhance the effects discussed here. However, depending on their masses and their flavor mixing with active species, sterile neutrinos could have number densities and energy spectra which differ from those of active neutrinos [\cite=2005PhRvD..72f3004A] [\cite=2006PhRvL..97n1301K] [\cite=2010PhRvL.105r1301H] [\cite=2011JCAP...09..034H] [\cite=2014PhRvD..90h3503D], complicating the analysis given here.
