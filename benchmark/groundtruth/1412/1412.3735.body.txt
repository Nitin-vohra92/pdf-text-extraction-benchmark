Equivalent condition for approximately Cohen-Macaulay complexes

Introduction

In [\cite=eare] Eagon and Reiner proved that a simplicial complex is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if the ideal associated to its Alexander dual has linear resolution. Later Herzog and Hibi [\cite=hehi] generalized it and proved that a simplicial complex is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay if and only if the ideal associated to its Alexander dual is componentwise linear. We use their result to give a similar equivalent condition for a simplicial complex to be approximately Cohen-Macaulay.

We begin with a brief introduction to the topic. When we say that a simplicial complex is Cohen-Macaulay, sequentially Cohen-Macaulay, or approximately Cohen-Macaulay, we always think that its Stanley-Reisner ring has this property.

For a simplicial complex Δ on the set of vertices [formula] and a field [formula], the Stanley-Reisner ring (or face ring) is the ring [formula], where IΔ is generated by all squarefree monomials [formula] for which [formula] is not a face in Δ.

We recall combinatorial description of Cohen-Macaulay complexes:

Let σ be a simplex in a simplicial complex Δ. The link of σ in Δ, denoted by lkΔσ, is the simplicial complex [formula].

(Reisner [\cite=re]) Let [formula] be the face ring of Δ. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

R is Cohen-Macaulay ring.

H̃i(lkΔσ) = 0 if i <  dim (lkΔσ) for all simplices σ∈Δ.

For some techniques of counting homology we refer the reader to Section 3.2 of [\cite=lami]. We need also the following definitions:

[\cite=go] A non Cohen-Macaulay local ring A is called approximately Cohen-Macaulay if there is an element a in the maximal ideal such that A / (an) is Cohen-Macaulay ring of dimension dim (A) - 1 for all n > 0.

A ring A of dimension d is called sequentially Cohen-Macaulay if there exists a filtration of ideals of A: such that each Di / Di - 1 is Cohen-Macaulay and

Let Δ be a simplicial complex on the set of vertices V, we define its Alexander dual to be [formula].

We say that a graded ideal I  ⊂  A is componentwise linear if Ij has linear resolutions for each degree j.

There is a nice description of approximately Cohen-Macaulay rings:

[\cite=cucu] Let A be a non Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension d. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

A is an approximately Cohen-Macaulay ring.

A is a sequentially Cohen-Macaulay ring with filtration 0 = D0  ⊂  D1  ⊂  D2 = A, where dim (D1) = d - 1.

Equivalent condition

We will make use of the following result of Herzog and Hibi [\cite=hehi].

[\cite=hehi] Let Δ be a simplicial complex. Then Stanley-Reisner ring [formula] is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay if and only if [formula] the ideal associated to its Alexander dual, is componentwise linear.

Our theorem reads as follows.

Let Δ be a simplicial complex. Then the Stanley-Reisner ring [formula] is approximately Cohen-Macaulay if and only if [formula], ideal associated to its Alexander dual, is componentwise linear and generated in two consecutive degrees.

By Proposition [\ref=approx], [formula] is approximately Cohen-Macaulay if and only if [formula] is a sequentially Cohen-Macaulay ring with filtration where dim (D1) = d - 1. Due to the Theorem [\ref=seqen] of Herzog and Hibi this is equivalent to componentwise linearity of [formula], and existence of a filtration where dim (D1) = d - 1. From Appendix of [\cite=bjwawe] we get that if such a filtration exists, then it is unique and coincides with the one given by where IΔ,Δ〈ji - 1〉 is the ideal in [formula] generated by monomials xA, with [formula]. The simplicial complex Δ〈ji - 1〉 is generated by faces of Δ of dimension  at least ji - 1, where [formula] are the dimensions of facets of Δ. We have also that dim (Δ〈ji - 1〉) = ji - 1. Hence the desired filtration exists if and only if Δ has facets of dimension d and d - 1. Ideal [formula] is generated by monomials xA for [formula], that is, for [formula], where σ∈Δ. We have to take all xA corresponding to facets and they all already generate ideal. Hence the ideal [formula] is generated in two consecutive degrees v - d and v - (d - 1), where [formula]. Since each step of our reasoning was an equivalence, the contrary also holds.
