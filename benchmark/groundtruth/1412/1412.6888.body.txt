Class field theory for open curves over local fields

Introduction

In this note, we investigate the class field theory for an open (=non proper) curve over a local field with arbitrary characteristic. Although a large number of studies have been made on such a theory for higher dimensional varieties over a p-adic field (e.g., [\cite=SSaito85b], [\cite=JS03], [\cite=Yamazaki09CFT] and [\cite=Yamazaki10]), little is known over a local field with positive characteristic. Precisely, let k be a local field of characteristic p  ≥  0. Here, a local field means a complete discrete valuation field with finite residue field. Let U be a regular and geometrically connected curve over a local field k. Because one can find the smooth compactification X of U uniquely which contains U as a dense open subvariety, we often say that U is an open curve. A topological group C(U) which is called the idèle class group, and the reciprocity homomorphism

[formula]

are introduced as in [\cite=Hira10] (see Sect. [\ref=sec:local]). In this note, we show the following theorem.

The kernel [formula] is the maximal divisible subgroup of C(U).

On the Pontrjagin dual group [formula], we also prove the following theorem.

The reciprocity homomorphism ρU induces a surjective homomorphism

[formula]

with kernel [formula] for some r  ≥  0, where [formula] is the group of all continuous homomorphisms [formula] of finite order.

Here, the invariant r is the rank of the smooth compactification X of U ([\cite=SSaito85b], Def. 2.5) which depends on the type of the reduction of X. For example, r = 0 if it has good reduction. In the terms of the fundamental groups we have

[formula]

where [formula] is the topological closure of the image of ρU. This quotient [formula] classifies completely split coverings of U, that is, a finite abelian covering of U in which any closed point P∈U splits completely (cf.  [\cite=SSaito85b], II, Def. 2.1). As in the classical class field theory, the theorem above implies the following:

[formula] We have a one to one correspondence between the set of abelian étale coverings of U which are not completely split and the one of finite index open subgroups of C(U).

[formula] For an abelian étale covering f:V  →  U which is not completely split, the reciprocity homomorphism ρU and the norm homomorphism NV / U:C(V)  →  C(U) (will be introduced in Sect. [\ref=sec:class_groups]) gives an isomorphism

[formula]

of finite abelian groups.

The theorems above are known when the curve U itself is proper ([\cite=SSaito85b], [\cite=Yoshida03]) or the case of [formula] ([\cite=Hira10]). So our main interest is in the case of [formula]. The proof is essentially same as in the proof of the class field theory for curves over global fields due to K. Kato and S. Saito ([\cite=KS83a], Thm. 3, [\cite=KS86], Thm. 9.1). One of the reasons that their proof works here is the cohomological dimensions of the base fields. Since we divided the proof into two: the prime to p-part and the p-part, the proof is much simpler than the one for curves over global fields.

In Section [\ref=sec:ray], we also introduce the ray class field theory

[formula]

which describes bounded ramification along a given Weil divisor D on X with support [formula]. Here, the fundamental group [formula] is introduced by using Kato's ramification subgroup of the abelian Galois group of 2-dimensional local fields (see Sect. [\ref=sec:ray]).

Notations

Throughout this paper, k is a local field, namely a complete discrete valuation field with finite residue field. A curve over a field is an integral separated scheme of dimension 1 over the field.

For a field F, we denote by [formula] the separable closure of F and [formula] denotes the maximal abelian extension of F.

For an abelian group A and a positive integer n, we denote by A / n the cokernel of the map n:A  →  A defined by x  ↦  nx.

For any topological abelian group G, we denote by [formula] the set of all continuous homomorphisms [formula] of finite order, where [formula] is given the discrete topology.

For a profinite group G and a prime number l, we define the l-part of G denoted by G{l} to be [formula], where N runs over all open normal subgroups of G with G / N is a l-group.

Local class field theory

A 2-dimensional local field is a complete discrete valuation field whose residue field is a local field. In this section, we review some definitions and results of class field theory for 2-dimensional local fields following [\cite=Kato79], [\cite=Kato80]. Here we emphasize our attention to the case of positive characteristic. Let K be a 2-dimensional local field of [formula] with residue field k.

2-dimensional local class field theory

The class field theory of K describes the abelian Galois group [formula] of K by constructing a canonical continuous homomorphism called the reciprocity homomorphism

[formula]

where K2(K) is the Milnor K-group of K. The multiplicative group K× and the Milnor K-group K2(K) have good topologies (introduced in [\cite=Kato79], Sect. 7) and this makes ρK continuous. We omit the detailed exposition on the definitions of these topologies. But under the topologies, the unit group [formula] is open in K×. The symbol map

[formula]

and the norm map

[formula]

for a finite extension L / K are continuous. Note also that any continuous homomorphism [formula] is automatically of finite order with respect to this topology ([\cite=Kato80], Sect. 3.5, Rem. 4).

For a field F of characteristic p > 0 and n  ≥  0, define

[formula]

where [formula] is the Galois module defined by the étale sheaf of the logarithmic part of the de Rham-Witt complex. This Galois module plays the role of [formula] for m prime to p, where [formula] is the Galois module of m-th roots of unity. We define (following [\cite=Kato80], Sect. 3.2, Def. 1)

[formula]

where m ranges over all integers m which are prime to p and [formula].

For any prime number l  ≠  p, we have

[formula]

where A{l} is the l-part of a torsion abelian group A.

[formula] The reciprocity homomorphism ρK induces an isomorphism

[formula]

[formula] We have the following commutative diagram

[formula]

where ∂:K2(K)  →  k× is the boundary homomorphism, and ρk is the reciprocity homomorphism of k. In particular, an element χ∈H1(K) is unramified, that is, the corresponding cyclic extension of K is unramified if and only if [formula] annihilates [formula].

From the above theorem, the correspondence L  ↦  NL / KK2(L) gives a one to one correspondence between the set of finite abelian field extensions of K and the one of finite index open subgroups of K2(K).

[formula] and is a divisible group.

Ramification theory

For n  ≥  1, let [formula] be the higher unit groups of K, where [formula] is the maximal ideal of the valuation ring of K. Denote by UnK2(K) the subgroup of K2(K) generated by the image of the symbol map

[formula]

We also have an increasing filtration [formula] on Hq(K) ([\cite=Kato83], Def. 2.1) with [formula].

Let K be a 2-dimensional local field. For χ∈H1(K), [formula] if and only if [formula] annihilates Un + 1KM2(K).

On the abelian Galois group [formula], this filtration on H1(K) induces the ramification filtration [formula] which is defined by

[formula]

The above proposition implies that the reciprocity homomorphism ρK induces a bijection

[formula]

Since we are only considering abelian extensions, one adopt the Kato's ramification subgroups. However, in our case of [formula], it is known that the filtration coincides with Abbes-Saito's logarithmic version of ramification subgroups [\cite=AS02] which is defined on the absolute Galois group [formula] more generally ([\cite=AS09], Cor. 9.12).

Curves over local fields

Let k be a local field of positive characteristic p. Let U be a regular and geometrically connected curve over k with function field K  =  k(U) and U0 the set of closed points in U. For a point P∈U0, we denote by k(P) the residue field at P that is a finite extension of k, and KP the completion of K at P. The field KP is known to be a 2-dimensional local field with residue field k(P). By the desingularization at the point outside U there exists uniquely a proper regular curve X over k which contains U as a dense open subvariety. We put [formula].

Idèle Class Groups

First we define a homomorphism

[formula]

as follows:

[formula] For P∈U0, the inclusion [formula] induces K2(K)  →  K2(KP).

[formula] For P∈U∞, we have the boundary map ∂P:K2(KP)  →  k(P)×.

The direct sum of these homomorphisms gives the required ∂.

The cokernel [formula] of ∂ is called the idèle class group of U.

The idèle class group C(U) is a quotient of the restricted product [formula] with respect to the closed subgroup [formula] which is a topological group induced from the topology on K2(KP) (cf.  Sect. [\ref=sec:local]). The idèle class group C(U) is endowed with the quotient topology.

Next, as in Section 2 of [\cite=Hira10], the 2-dimensional local class field theory [formula] induces a homomorphism

[formula]

It factors through C(U) by the reciprocity law of K ([\cite=SSaito85b], Chap. II, Prop. 1.2). The induced homomorphism

[formula]

is the reciprocity homomorphism of U. Furthermore, the norm map Nk(P) / k:k(P)×  →  k× for P∈U0 and the composition [formula] for P∈U∞ induce a homomorphism N:C(U)  →  k×. They make the following diagram commutative:

[formula]

where [formula] is the structure morphism and the groups C(U)0 and [formula] are defined by the exactness of the horizontal rows.

Norm homomorphisms

Here, we introduce the norm homomorphisms on the idèle class groups. Let f:V  →  U be a (finite) étale covering. This extends uniquely to the smooth compactifications Y  →  X which is also denoted by f. We also define [formula].

Define the norm homomorphism

[formula]

for f as follows: Let L / K be the extension of function fields corresponding to f:V  →  U.

[formula] For Q∈V∞,P  =  f(Q), we have the norm homomorphism K2(LQ)  →  K2(KP) of the Milnor K-groups.

[formula] For Q∈V0,P  =  f(Q), we have the norm homomorphism k(Q)×  →  k(P)×.

These give a homomorphism

[formula]

Since the norm K2(L)  →  K2(K) is compatible with above norms, we obtain NV / U:C(V)  →  C(U).

Since the reciprocity homomorphisms of local class field theory commutes with norm homomorphisms, we obtain the following commutative diagram:

[formula]

Unramified class field theory

The following theorem for the compactification X is known due to Saito [\cite=SSaito85b] and Yoshida [\cite=Yoshida03] in which C(X) is denoted by SK1(X).

[formula] [formula] and [formula] are the maximal divisible subgroups of C(X) and C(X)0 respectively.

[formula] [formula] for some r  ≥  0, where [formula] is the topological closure of the image [formula].

[formula] The image [formula] is finite.

In particular, the fundamental group [formula] is written as

[formula]

where [formula] is the torsion part of [formula] which is finite. If X has a k-rational point, this extension splits. For any positive integer m, the reciprocity homomorphism ρU of U in general induces

[formula]

On the dual groups of ρX,m, Theorem [\ref=thm:ucft] implies the following.

For any prime l (which may be p) and a positive integer n, [formula] is surjective.

By Theorem [\ref=thm:ucft] (i), ρ0X induces an injection

[formula]

and the quotient C(X)0 / ln is a finite group (Thm. [\ref=thm:ucft] (iii)). From the Pontrjagin duality theorem for profinite groups, we obtain the surjection

[formula]

on the dual groups. Put [formula]. The spectral sequence [formula] gives an exact sequence

[formula]

where [formula] is the Gk-coinvariant module (cf.  [\cite=SSaito85b], Chap. II, Lem. 3.2). In particular, [formula]. The commutative diagram ([\ref=eq:VX]) induces the following commutative diagram with exact rows:

[formula]

By local class field theory, the left vertical map [formula] is bijective. Because of

[formula]

the right vertical map in the diaram above is surjecitve. Therefore, [formula] is surjective.

The induced homomorphism

[formula]

from the reciprocity homomorphism ρX satisfies the following:

[formula] [formula] is surjective.

[formula] [formula] for some r  ≥  0.

The assertion (ii) follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:ucft] (ii). From Proposition [\ref=thm:uftdual], the reciprocity homomorphism ρX induces the surjective homomorphism

[formula]

for any positive integer m. By taking the inductive limit, this gives

[formula]

Take a character [formula]. By the very definition of [formula], the character χ has finite order (cf.  Notations in Section 1). Hence there exists m such that [formula] and thus [formula] is surjective.

Proof of the main theorems

We keep the notation of Section [\ref=sec:class_groups]. In this section, we show the following theorem.

Let U be a regular and geometrically connected curve over a local field k of characteristic p > 0. The induced homomorphism

[formula]

from the reciprocity homomorphism ρU satisfies the following:

[formula] [formula] is surjective.

[formula] [formula] for some r  ≥  0.

First we determine [formula] by comparing with [formula] for the compactification X of U.

For any P∈U∞, put [formula], where [formula] is the completion of [formula]. The localization sequence of the étale cohomology groups on [formula] gives an exact sequence

[formula]

In terms of the Galois cohomology groups, we have

[formula]

The Tate duality theorem for local fields implies [formula]. The excision theorem induces [formula] (cf.  [\cite=MilneEC], Chap. III, Cor. 1.28) and we obtain the commutative diagram below:

[formula]

where ρk(P) and ρKP are the reciprocity homomorphisms of k(P) and KP respectively (Thm. [\ref=thm:CFT]). Next we consider the following commutative diagram:

[formula]

Here, the upper horizontal sequence is the localization sequence, and is exact. The diagram ([\ref=eq:loc]) gives

[formula]

The former group is known to be isomorphic to [formula] for some r  ≥  0 (Cor. [\ref=cor:rhoXv] (ii)). So the assertion (ii) follows from this.

To determine the prime to p-part of [formula], we introduce some notations. For an abelian profinite group G, we denote by G{p'} the prime to p-part of G. We denote by

[formula]

[formula] [formula] and [formula] are l-divisible for any prime l  ≠  p.

[formula] The image [formula] is finite.

The proof is basically same as the one in the case of curves over p-adic field ([\cite=Hira10]). Here, we give a sketch of the proof.

(ii) We have the following diagram with exact rows:

[formula]

where [formula] is the open immersion. It is known that [formula] is finite (Thm. [\ref=thm:ucft], (iii)). Since we are considering the prime to p-part, the left vertical map factors through [formula]. By Merkrjev's theorem ([\cite=FV], IX, Thm. 4.3), K2(k(P)) is a sum of a finite group and a divisible subgroup. Since a profinite group contains no non-trivial divisible elements, the image of [formula] is finite. Hence the image of (ρ0U)' is finite in [formula].

(i) For any positive integer m which is prime to p, we have [formula], where [formula] and [formula] is the open immersion. We define a commutative diagram:

[formula]

Here, the horizontal sequences are exact, and the left vertical map h2 is bijective by the Merkurjev-Suslin theorem [\cite=MS82]. The middle vertical map h is also bijective from the Kummer theory

[formula]

for P∈U0 and the Merkurjev-Suslin theorem again

[formula]

for P∈U∞. Thus, the induced homomorphism [formula] is injective. By the duality theorem ([\cite=Saito89]) we have [formula] so that the reciprocity homomorphism [formula] is injective. Therefore,

[formula]

The finiteness of the image of (ρ0U)' implies that there exists a positive integer M which is prime to p such that [formula] (see the proof of Thm. 5.1 in [\cite=SSaito85b], for this argument). From this, [formula] is l-divisible for any l  ≠  p.

[formula]

From local class field theory, [formula] is l-divisible for any prime l  ≠  p. The image of the norm N:C(U)  →  k× is open and has finite index in k×. Therefore, [formula] is l-divisible and we obtain the assertion.

Let l be a prime with l  ≠  p and n a positive integer. The reciprocity homomorphism [formula] induces a surjection [formula].

From Proposition [\ref=thm:sigma'] (i), ρ0X induces an injection

[formula]

and the quotient C(U)0 / ln is a finite group (Prop. [\ref=thm:sigma'] (ii)). Hence, we obtain a surjection

[formula]

on the dual groups.

If we assume [formula], then the short exact sequence

[formula]

splits. Hence the upper sequence in the following diaram is exact:

[formula]

where the left vertical homomorphism is induced by local class field theory and is bijective. Therefore, [formula] is surjective.

In general, one can find a finite extension k' / k such that [formula]. Put [formula] and f:U'  →  U be the induced morphism. Since the norm homomorphism N: = NU' / U:C(U')  →  C(U) is compatible with the base change, we have the following commutative diagram:

[formula]

To show the assertion we may assume that [formula] is a l-group. In fact, we denote by g:V  →  U corresponding to the l-Sylow subgroup of G. This induces [formula]. Furthermore, by induction on the extension degree of k' / k we may assume that the Galois group G is a cyclic group of the order l. From the spectral sequence [formula], we have the following commutative diagram with exact rows:

[formula]

Here, for a G-module M, let MG be the G-invariant submodule of M. From Lemma [\ref=lem:exact] below, the left vertical map is surjective. In fact, [formula] or [formula]. In either case, [formula] is surjective by applying the 5-lemma to the above diagram.

For any prime l (which may be p), let k' / k be a Galois extension of degree l with Galois group G and put [formula]. Then, the left vertical map in the commutaive diagram below is surjective:

[formula]

where N: = NU' / U:C(U')  →  C(U) is the norm homomorphism.

Let ψ be an element of the kernel of [formula]. It induces an element ψP of [formula] for each P∈U∞. Since ψP is annihilated by the unramified extension KPk' of KP, so that ψP annihilates U0K2(KP) (Thm. [\ref=thm:Kato82b.3], (ii)). Thus, the assertion is reduced to the case of U  =  X. From Corollary [\ref=cor:rhoXv] (i), [formula] and [formula] are surjective.

[formula]

Recall that the quotient [formula] classifies complete split abelian coverings of X. If the induced covering [formula] is completely split, then

[formula]

is exact so that [formula] is injective. On the other hand, if f:X'  →  X is non-completely split covering, then [formula]. The kernel of [formula] is isomorphic to [formula].

Next, we investigate the p-part of the reciprocity homomorphism ρU.

For any positive integer n, [formula] is surjective.

Instead of using [formula] with [formula] in ([\ref=eq:loc]), the localization sequence gives

[formula]

From Proposition [\ref=thm:uftdual], [formula] is surjective. To show that [formula] is surjective, take [formula]. Since the homomorphism i above comes from the inclusion [formula] for P∈U∞, the 2-dimensional local class field theory implies [formula]. There exists [formula] such that [formula]. From [formula], the image of j(γ) by the homomorphism [formula] becomes zero for some finite Galois extension k' of k. Put [formula] and let f:U'  →  U be the induced morphism. Since the norm homomorphism N: = NU' / U:C(U')  →  C(U) is compatible with the base change, we have the following commutative diagram:

[formula]

Thus, there exists [formula] such that [formula] in [formula]. We prove that φ comes from [formula]. To show this we may assume that [formula] is a p-group by considering the p-Sylow subgroup of G. Furthermore, by induction on the extension degree of k' / k we may assume that the Galois group G is a cyclic group of the order p. We have the following commutative diagram:

[formula]

The upper sequence comes from the spectral sequence [formula] and is exact. Since φ' is fixed by G, χ' is also fixed by G. From Lemma [\ref=lem:exact], we have [formula] or [formula]. In either case, there exists χ in [formula] such that [formula] from the diagram above. Therefore, [formula] is surjective.

Now, we complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

From Proposition [\ref=prop:p'] and [\ref=prop:p], the reciprocity homomorphism ρU induces the surjective homomorphism

[formula]

for any positive integer m. This gives

[formula]

For any [formula], there exists m such that [formula] since χ has finite order. Hence, [formula] is surjective.

Finally, we show the following theorem on the kernel of ρU.

The kernel [formula] is the maximal divisible subgroup of C(U).

From Proposition [\ref=thm:sigma'], it is enough to show that ker (ρU) is p-divisible. The short exact sequence

[formula]

induces a short exact sequence

[formula]

where ρ0KP: = ρKP|U0K2(KP) is the restriction of ρKP. Since [formula] is p-divisible (Thm. [\ref=thm:ucft] (i)), it is enough to show that [formula] is also p-divisible for each P∈U∞.

For P∈U∞, it is also known that [formula] is p-divisible (Thm. [\ref=thm:Fesenko]). For any [formula], there exists [formula] such that ξ  =  pη. We have to show [formula]. Recall that [formula] and ∂P:K2(KP)  →  k(P)× is the boundary map. By [formula], we have 1  =  ∂P(ξ)  =  ∂P(pη)  =  ∂P(η)p in k(P)×. Since k(P)× contains no non-trivial p-torsion elements, we have ∂P(η)  =  1. In particular, η∈U0K2(KP) and thus [formula] is p-divisible.

Restricted Ramification

In this section, we study the abelian coverings of U restricting the ramification along a given divisor as a modulus. Let [formula] be an effective Weil divisor on X with support [formula]. Considering D as a modulus, we define the fundamental group [formula] with bounded ramification by:

[formula]

where [formula] is the ramification subgroup of [formula] in the upper numbering (Sect. [\ref=sec:local]). The fundamental group π1(X,D) can be defined by constructing some Galois category of coverings of X with restricted ramification along D (cf.  [\cite=Hira05]). The information on the ramification of 2-dimensional local field KP at P∈U∞ is related to the natural filtration UmK2(KP) (Prop. [\ref=prop:Kato]). Corresponding to this fundamental group, we define the idèle class group of U with modulus D by

[formula]

The 2-dimensional class field theory (Prop. [\ref=prop:Kato]) gives the reciprocity homomorphism

[formula]

Furthermore, the norm maps Nk(P) / k:k(P)×  →  k× induce N:C(X,D)  →  k× and the following diagram commutative:

[formula]

Here, the groups C(X,D)0 and [formula] are defined by the exactness of the horizontal rows.

[formula] [formula] is surjective.

[formula] [formula].

[formula] [formula] is the maximal divisible subgroup of C(X,D).

(i) By the very definitions, we have

[formula]

The right vertical map is bijective (Prop. [\ref=prop:Kato]) and [formula] is surjective (Thm. [\ref=thm:main]), so that [formula] is surjective.

(ii) From the surjections

[formula]

we obtain [formula].

(iii) The surjection [formula] gives a surjection [formula]. Theorem [\ref=thm:main2] implies the assertion.

As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:sigma'], we obtain the following lemma:

If mP  =  1 for all P∈|D|, then the image of ρ0X,D is finite.

For a general modulus [formula], we have the following commutative diagram:

[formula]

The graded quotients of the filtration [formula] are written in terms of the absolute Kähler differentials of the residue field k(P) (cf.  [\cite=BK86]).
