J/ψ and ψ(2S) measurement in p+p collisions at [formula] 200 and 500 GeV in the STAR experiment

Introduction

J/ψ and ψ(2S) are bound states of charm (c) and anti-charm ([formula]) quarks. Charmonium physical states have to be colorless, however they can be formed via a color-singlet (CS) or color-octet (CO) intermediate [formula] state. One of the first models of the charmonium production, the Color Singlet Model (CSM) [\cite=Braaten:1996pv], assumed that J/ψ is created through the color-singlet state only. This early prediction failed to describe the measured charmonium cross section which has led to the development of new models. For example, Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) [\cite=Braaten:1996pv] calculations were proposed in which a [formula] color-octet intermediate states, in addition to a color-singlet states, can bind to form charmonia.

However, the charmonium production mechanism in elementary particle collisions is not yet exactly known. For many years measurements of the J/ψ cross section have been used to test different J/ψ production models. While many models can describe relatively well the experimental data on the J/ψ cross section in p + p collisions [\cite=Abelev:2009qaa] [\cite=Adamczyk:2012ey] [\cite=Adare:2011vq] [\cite=PhysRevLett.79.572] [\cite=Acosta:2004yw] [\cite=Aad:2011sp] [\cite=Khachatryan:2010yr] [\cite=Aaij:2011jh], they have different predictions for the J/ψ polarization. Therefore, measurements of the J/ψ polarization may allow to discriminate among different models and provide new insight into the J/ψ production mechanism.

Charmonium measurements in STAR

In STAR, charmonia have been measured so far via the dielectron decay channel. The STAR detector [\cite=Ackermann2003624] is a multi-purpose detector that has large acceptance at mid-rapidity, |η|  <   1 with a full azimuthal coverage. Electrons can be identified using the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) [\cite=Anderson:2003ur] through ionization energy loss (dE / dx) measurement. The Time Of Flight (TOF) detector [\cite=Llope:2012ti] greatly enhances the electron identification capability at low momenta where the dE / dx bands for electrons and hadrons cross each other. At high pT, electron identification can be improved by the Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) [\cite=Beddo:2002zx] which measures electron energy and shower shape. The BEMC is also used to trigger on high-pT electrons (HT trigger). Minimum Bias (MB) events are triggered by the Vertex Position Detectors (VPD) [\cite=Llope:2003ti].

J/ψ measurements in p+p at [formula] 200 GeV

STAR has measured inclusive J/ψ pT spectra and polarization in p + p collisions at [formula] 200 GeV via the dielectron decay channel (Bee  =   5.9%) at mid-rapidity (|y|  <   1). These results are compared to different model predictions to understand J/ψ production mechanism in elementary collisions.

Left panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:Jpsi200] shows STAR low and high-pT measurements of J/ψ pT spectra [\cite=Kosarzewski:2012zz] [\cite=Adamczyk:2012ey] compared to model predictions. The Color Evaporation Model (CEM) [\cite=Frawley:2008kk] for prompt J/ψ can describe the pT spectrum reasonably well, except the region around pT  ≈   3 GeV/c where it over-predicts the data. NLO NRQCD calculations with color-singlet and color-octet transitions [\cite=Ma:2010jj] for prompt J/ψ match the data for pT  >  4 GeV/c. NNLO* CS model [\cite=Artoisenet:2008fc] for direct J/ψ production under-predicts the STAR data, but the prediction does not include contributions from ψ(2S), χC and B-meson decays to J/ψ.

In p+p collisions at [formula] 200 GeV STAR has also measured J/ψ polarization parameter λθ in the helicity frame at mid-rapidity and 2   <  pT  <   6 GeV/c [\cite=Adamczyk:2013vjy]. J / ψ polarization is analyzed via the angular distribution of the decay electrons that is described by: [formula], where θ and φ are polar and azimuthal angles, respectively; λθ, λφ and λθφ are the angular decay coefficients. The pT dependence of λθ is shown on the right panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:Jpsi200] with low-pT PHENIX results [\cite=PhysRevD.82.012001] and compared to NRQCD calculations [\cite=PhysRevD.81.014020] and the NLO+ CSM prediction [\cite=Lansberg:2010vq]. A trend observed in the RHIC data is towards longitudinal polarization as pT increases and, within experimental and theoretical uncertainties, the result is consistent with the NLO+ CSM model.

The inclusive J/ψ production is a combination of prompt and non-prompt J/ψ. The prompt J/ψ production consists of the direct one (~  60%) and feed-down from excited states ψ(2S)(~  10%) and χC(~  30%), while non-prompt J/ψ originate from B-hadron decays. STAR has estimated the contribution from B-meson decays using a measurement of azimuthal angular correlation between high-pT J/ψ and charged hadrons [\cite=Abelev:2009qaa] [\cite=Adamczyk:2012ey]. The relative contribution of B-hadron decays to inclusive J/ψ yield is strongly pT dependent and it is 10-25% for 4 <  pT  <   12 GeV/c, as it is shown on the left panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:feedDown]. The measurement is consistent with the FONLL+CEM prediction [\cite=Bedjidian:2004gd] [\cite=Cacciari:2005rk].

J/ψ and ψ(2S) measurements in p+p at [formula] 500 GeV

In order to further test the charmonium production mechanism and constrain the feed-down contribution from the excited states to the inclusive J/ψ production, the J/ψ and ψ(2S) signals were extracted in p + p collisions at [formula] 500 GeV at mid-rapidity. The J/ψ pT spectrum is shown on the left panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:Jpsi500]. The STAR results at [formula] 500 GeV (full circles) are compared to those at [formula] 200 GeV (open circles) and with measurements of other experiments in p+[formula] collisions at different energies. The STAR measurements cover pT range of 4 - 20 GeV/c with a good precision. It was also observed that J/ψ cross section follows the xT scaling: [formula], where [formula], with n  =   5.6 ±   0.2 at mid-rapidity and pT  >   5 GeV/c for a wide range of colliding energies [\cite=Abelev:2009qaa]. At [formula] 500 GeV the same xT scaling of high-pT J/ψ production is seen, as shown on the right panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:Jpsi500].

Right panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:feedDown] shows ψ(2S)  /  J / ψ ratio from STAR (red full circle) compared to measurements of other experiments at different colliding energies, in p + p and p + A collisions. The STAR data point is consistent with the observed trend, and no collision energy dependence of the ψ(2S) to J/  ψ ratio is seen with the current precision.

The statistics available at [formula] 500 GeV will allow us to extract the frame invariant polarization parameter, also in different reference frames, providing model independent information about the J/ψ polarization [\cite=Faccioli:2010kd]. It will be possible to measure the azimuthal polarization parameter, λφ, and improve precision of the λθ measurement. Analysis of J/ψ polarization at [formula] 500 GeV is ongoing.

Summary

In summary, STAR has measured the inclusive J/ψ cross section and polarization in p+p collisions at [formula] 200 GeV as a function of pT. The measurements are compared to different model predictions of the J/ψ production. The pT spectrum is described well by the NRQCD calculations while the measured polarization parameter λθ is consistent with the NLO+ CSM prediction. STAR new result for J/ψ at [formula] 500 GeV extends pT reach up to 20 GeV/c. The first measurement of ψ(2S)  /  J / ψ ratio in p+p collisions at [formula] 500 GeV is reported and compared with results from other experiments. No collision energy dependence is observed.
