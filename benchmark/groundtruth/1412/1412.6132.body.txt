On the relation between the non-flat cosmological models and the elliptic integral of first kind

Introduction

In our recent paper [\citep=meri13], we have shown that the standard cosmological dependence of the luminosity distance dL(z) on the redshift z can also be described analytically for a non-zero cosmological constant, especially if the Universe is spatially flat. In this result the elliptic integral of the first kind plays a key role.

The question emerges immediately of whether the restriction to the flat cosmological model is needed or does the elliptic integral of the first kind play a role also for non-flat models with non-zero cosmological constant? This note studies these questions.

A recapitulation of the known relations

We start with [\citep=car92]

[formula]

[formula]

In this equation, c is the speed of light in vacuum, H0 is the Hubble-constant, and Ωk  +  ΩM  +  ΩΛ  =  1. The notation "sinn" means the standard function sinh  for Ωk  >  0, and sin  for Ωk  <  0, respectively. If Ωk  =  0, then "sinn x" means x and one simply has

[formula]

where ΩM  +  ΩΛ  =  1. The proper-motion dPM(z) distance is connected to luminosity distance dL(z) by relation dPM(z)(1 + z)  =  dL(z) [\citep=wei72]. In both equations, it must be ΩM  ≥  0. (The case ΩM  =  0 is unphysical, but it can serve as a limit.) The remaining two omega factors can have both signs.

Eq(1) of [\citet=meri13] and Eq(1) here are equivalent. Eq(3) of [\citet=meri13] and Eq(2) here are identical.

In the special case of ΩΛ  =  0, the integral in Eq(1) can be evaluated by the so-called Mattig formula [\citep=mat58]. In the special case of Ωk  =  0, the elliptic integrals can be used [\citep=meri13]. The special case, where ΩM  =  0, in Eq(1) the integral is very simple. As a result, if one omega factor is zero, but the remaining two ones are non-zeros, no numerical integration is needed. In addition, if just two omega factors are simultaneously zeros, then the integration via primitive functions is very easy. Only the case where all three omega factors are non-zeros needs numerical integration. We also search for eventual analytical integrations here.

Integration

In what follows we assume that ΩΛ  ≠  0, Ωk  ≠  0, ΩM  >  0, and Ωk  +  ΩM  +  ΩΛ  =  1 in Eq(1). We rewrite the denominator of Eq(1) as follows:

[formula]

[formula]

Using only the first two terms in the Taylor series for function g(Q),

[formula]

and defining

[formula]

we obtain for the integral in Eq(1)

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

It is essential to emphasize here that the first term on the right hand side of this equation is not identical to the right hand side of Eq(2). The difference is given by the fact that in Eq(2) it holds that ΩM  +  ΩΛ  =  1, but here it holds that ΩM  +  ΩΛ  =  1  -  Ωk  ≠  1.

Inspecting Eqs(3-13) of [\citet=meri13], we recognize that the constraint ΩM  +  ΩΛ  =  1 is not needed from the mathematical point of view. We can easily repeat the whole integration procedure of Eqs(3-13) in [\citet=meri13] for any ΩM  >  0 and ΩΛ  >  0. All this means that the first term on the right hand side of Eq(6) can again be solved analytically using the elliptic integral of first kind. The only difference is given in Eq(5) of [\citet=meri13]. In [\citet=meri13] ΩM  +  ΩΛ  =  1 was used, but here both omega factors can be arbitrarily positive. This means that only the factor Ω1 / 3MΩ1 / 6Λ is influenced, but the integral in Eq(5) of [\citet=meri13] itself remains unchanged. For the sake of completeness, it must be added that, using the remark of Section 3 of [\citet=meri13], we can generalize here the solution also for arbitrary ΩΛ  <  0 and ΩM  >  0. Hence, the first term of the right hand side of Eq(6) can always be calculated analytically.

On the other hand, the second term of Eq(6) is a complicated formula, and we did not find any primitive function for this integral. It should therefore be calculated numerically. In either case, this integral is finite for any 0  <  z  <    ∞  .

Remarks

It may seem that Eq(6) did not give any new result, because - in essence - some numerical integration is again necessary. But this is not the case, because for small 0  <  |Ωk|  ≪  1≃ΩM  +  ΩΛ, the procedure of the previous section can be useful. This can be seen as follows.

The interval of convergence of the Taylor series for g(Q) in Eq(4) is given by |Q| < 1. This means that it has to be

[formula]

for any ∞    >  z'  ≥  0. If this requirement holds, then even higher terms of the Taylor series can be used.

The requirement of Eq(7) can also be formulated in an other form that does not use z'. For -  ΩΛ  ≥  ΩM  >  0, the first term in f(z') is zero for 1  +  z'  =  ( - ΩΛ  /  ΩM)1 / 3  ≥  1. Hence, for this z' one has f(z')  <  0, and |Q| < 1 is not fulfilled. Thus, the term (1 + z')3ΩM  +  ΩΛ must be positive. For z'  =  0 we must also have |Q| < 1, and it has to be ΩM  +  ΩΛ  >  |Ωk|. This combination of the omega factors is thus the necessary condition for |Q| < 1. To obtain the sufficient condition, one has to discuss f(z') as a standard cubic function. If 2|Ωk| / (3ΩM)  <  1 holds, then the necessary condition is also a sufficient one, because then f(z') is an increasing function for any z'  ≥  0. If 2|Ωk| / (3ΩM)  ≥  1 holds, then one must have f(z')  >  0 for 1 + z'  =  2|Ωk| / (3ΩM), because f(z') has a minimum for this z'. It is positive for ΩΛ  >  4|Ωk|3 / (27Ω2M) and |Q| < 1 holds; but it is non-positive for ΩΛ  ≤  4|Ωk|3 / (27Ω2M) and |Q| < 1 does not hold.

All this means that mainly for 0  <  |Ωk|  ≪  ΩM  +  ΩΛ≃1 the procedure of this note is quite usable. (For the sake of precision it must be added that either the condition 2|Ωk| / (3ΩM)  <  1 or the condition ΩΛ  >  4|Ωk|3 / (27Ω2M) must also be fulfilled.) In this case, the second term in Eq(6) is a small correction to the first one. Then it can be simpler to numerically calculate only this small correction and not the whole integral of Eq(1). In any case, our "semi-analytical" procedure can serve as a check of the numerical calculation of Eq(1).

Conclusion

We have shown that the integral on the right hand side of Eq(1) can be partly calculated analytically using the elliptic integral of the first kind even in the case, when all the three omega factors are non-zeros. This calculation can be useful for 0  <  |Ωk|  ≪  1.
