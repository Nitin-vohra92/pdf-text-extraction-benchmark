An experimental test of the viscous anisotropy hypothesis for partially molten rocks

Shear deformation of partially molten rocks gives rise to melt segregation into sheets (bands in cross-section) that emerge at a low angle to the shear plane. This mode of segregation was predicted with two-phase flow theory[\cite=stevenson1989] and subsequently discovered in experiments[\cite=holtzman2003a] [\cite=king2010]. It has been proposed that melt-enriched bands, if present in the mantle of Earth, would permit rapid extraction of melt[\cite=kohlstedt2009], produce significant anisotropy in seismic wave propagation[\cite=kendall1994], and provide a mechanism for the seismic discontinuity that is, in some places, associated with the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary[\cite=kawakatsu2009]. The emergence[\cite=spiegelman2003] and low angle[\cite=katz2006] of melt-enriched bands under simple-shear deformation can be reproduced using two-phase flow theory with a non-Newtonian, isotropic viscosity. This theory describes the flow of a low-viscosity liquid (melt) through a permeable and viscously deformable solid matrix (grains)[\cite=mckenzie1984]. However, an unrealistically strong stress-dependence of viscosity was required to match the low angle of bands observed in experiments[\cite=katz2006]. This disagreement between models and experiments found a possible resolution by the incorporation of anisotropic viscosity arising from coherent alignment of melt pockets between grains (i.e., melt-preferred orientation, MPO) in response to a deviatoric stress[\cite=takei2009a] [\cite=takei2009b] [\cite=butler2012] [\cite=takei2013].

Crucially, with the inclusion of viscous anisotropy, two-phase flow theory also predicts a simultaneous but distinct mode of melt segregation driven by large-scale gradients in shear stress. This mode is termed base-state melt segregation[\cite=takei2009c] [\cite=takei2013] [\cite=katz2013]. Base-state melt segregation is not predicted if viscosity is isotropic; thus, its occurrence in experiments represents a test of the hypothesis that MPO leads to anisotropy in viscosity. Below we explain base-state melt segregation in more detail; we then present new experimental results that demonstrate its occurrence.

Figure [\ref=fig:theory]a illustrates how anisotropy in grain/melt microstructure (i.e., MPO) produces viscous anisotropy through the mechanics of diffusion creep[\cite=takei2009a]. For a representative grain in an aggregate subjected to a deviatoric stress, the contact area with neighbouring grains decreases for grain boundaries that are normal to the direction of the minimum principal stress σ3 (the minimum eigenvalue of the deviatoric stress tensor; compression positive). A decrease in contact area shortens the diffusion pathway for material transport along this boundary relative to grain boundaries with different orientations. Since melt provides a fast pathway for diffusion, this change in the contiguity between neighbouring grains reduces the timescale of the diffusive response to the σ3 component of stress. Conversely, an increase in grain-grain contact area in the direction of the maximum principal stress σ1 lengthens the diffusion pathway on this surface and thus the timescale for diffusive response to stress in this direction.

To translate these concepts from the microscopic to the continuum scale, consider a representative element of volume (REV) that is large enough to contain many microscopic units (grains and melt pockets) and small enough to define a point property at the scale of macroscopic features of interest (Fig. [\ref=fig:theory]b). Under deviatoric stress, melt pockets in the REV coherently align normal to the σ3 direction and the timescale for the diffusive response to stress is reduced in this direction. If the dominant deformation mechanism of the aggregate is diffusion creep, this rapid response imparts a reduction of the continuum viscosity in the σ3 direction[\cite=cooper1986] [\cite=takei2009a]. Likewise, the change in grain contiguity associated with σ1 increases the viscosity in that direction.

Viscous anisotropy can be quantified with a highly symmetric, fourth-rank tensor (Supp. Mat.). The orientation of this tensor is described by three angles that rotate it with respect to the system coordinates. This rotation is used to align anisotropy with the principal directions of deviatoric stress. As a simplifying approximation, we assume that, at each point in the domain, the plane containing σ1 and σ3 is parallel to the imposed shear direction and perpendicular to the imposed shear plane. This leaves only one angle to be determined, the angle Θ between the shear plane and the σ3 direction. The magnitude of anisotropy is parameterised with two scalars: α specifies the viscosity reduction in the σ3 direction; β specifies the viscosity increase in the σ1 direction. When either or both α and β are non-zero at a point in the continuum, the viscosity at that point is anisotropic. The associated tensor then has non-zero off-diagonal terms that couple shear stress to normal strain rate (and vice versa). It is these terms that give rise to base-state segregation[\cite=takei2009c] [\cite=takei2013].

To clarify the physical mechanism of base-state segregation, consider a cylindrical sample in a sealed chamber, deformed in torsion at a constant twist rate (Fig. [\ref=fig:theory]c). Before any deviatoric stress is applied, the grain/melt microstructure is isotropic and the rate of (de)compaction is zero everywhere within the sample. With initiation of twisting, as a consequence of the deviatoric stress, a MPO develops and the viscosity becomes anisotropic. The imposed strain rate, aligned melt pockets, and consequent pattern of stress are shown schematically in Figure [\ref=fig:theory]b-c. The disparity between |σ1| and |σ3| gives rise to a net compression that, because it is everywhere tangent to the cylinder, is a compressive hoop stress. This compressive hoop stress pushes the solid grains radially outward and causes a pressure gradient that drives melt radially inward[\cite=takei2013] (details provided in Supp. Mat.). This differential motion is the base-state melt segregation under torsional deformation.

To test this prediction and hence the hypothesis that viscosity is anisotropic, we imposed a constant twist-rate on cylindrical samples of partially molten rock that initially had uniform melt fraction (Table [\ref=tab:experiments]). In tangential sections of quenched samples that were deformed in torsion (Fig. [\ref=fig:rose]), we observe aligned melt pockets and low angle, melt-enriched bands. Melt-enriched bands are also evident in transverse sections (Fig. [\ref=fig:maps]). More importantly, analyses of optical micrographs of transverse sections reveal a gradient in melt fraction in the radial direction, with melt concentrated toward the axis of the cylinder. This gradient in melt fraction corresponds to the base-state melt segregation predicted if viscosity is anisotropic. Our observations of MPO, melt-enriched bands, and radial melt segregation are detailed in subsequent paragraphs.

The rose diagram in Figure [\ref=fig:rose]b demonstrates that at a local shear strain of γ  =  4.6, melt pockets are aligned at ~  29[formula] to the shear plane, antithetic to shear direction. In contrast, the expected σ3 direction, based on cylindrical simple shear flow with isotropic viscosity, is 45[formula] to the shear plane. The observed low angle of melt alignment means that, at this shear strain, either melt pockets are not normal to the σ3 direction[\cite=zimmerman1999] or σ3 has rotated counter-clockwise. The reason for this alignment is unknown; it might be due to the emergence of chains of melt pockets[\cite=holtzman2007] (Fig. [\ref=fig:rose]c) or to the anisotropic viscosity itself. In the theory of two-phase flow with viscous anisotropy, elaborated in the Supplementary Material, it is generally assumed that melt pockets align perpendicular to σ3, as suggested by deformation experiments on an analogue material at small strains (γ  <  0.2)[\cite=takei2010]. The observed MPO, therefore, may represent a subtle but important discrepancy between observation and theory that we return to below. Despite this possible discrepancy, the observed, strong MPO demonstrates the microstructural anisotropy that hypothetically causes viscous anisotropy.

Two-phase flow theory with anisotropic viscosity[\cite=takei2013] also predicts the emergence of sheets of high melt fraction that appear as bands in two-dimensional sections[\cite=king2010]. In Figure [\ref=fig:maps], these features appear as radial lines of high melt fraction where sheets cross the transverse section. For the sample deformed to an outer-radius shear strain of γ(R) = 5.0 (Fig. [\ref=fig:maps]a, c), the melt-enriched bands are distributed uniformly around the cylinder, whereas at a larger strain of γ(R) = 14.3 (Fig. [\ref=fig:maps]b, d), the azimuthal distribution of melt-enriched bands is inhomogeneous, dominated by several extraordinarily large bands. Because the total strain decreases toward the centre of the cylinder, the region close to axial centre exhibits less banding. More significantly, however, Figures [\ref=fig:maps]c and d demonstrate a general increase in melt fraction toward the centre of the cylinder, consistent with the predicted base-state migration of melt radially inward.

Radial profiles of the azimuthally averaged, normalized melt fraction are presented in Figure [\ref=fig:profile]a for seven experiments, each with a different final strain. The melt fraction in an experiment with no deformation (grey line) varies by less than 10% along a radius. In all deformed samples, the melt fraction increases toward the centre of the cylinder -- evidence for base-state segregation. For the three samples deformed to an outer-radius shear strain of γ(R)  =  5.5  ±  0.5, each radial profile of melt concentration reaches its peak at a radius of [formula] mm, corresponding to a shear strain of [formula]. Melt fraction decreases from that point toward the axis of the cylinder; this behavior is expected because the low-stress/low-strain region at small radius has little or no MPO and hence has essentially isotropic viscosity (α  =  β  =  0). For samples deformed to higher outer-radius shear strains (γ(R)  =  7.3,  11.1, and 14.3), peaks in melt fraction occur at a radius of [formula] mm. The sample with the highest outer-radius shear strain (γ(R) = 14.3) exhibits the largest ratio of maximum to minimum melt fraction [formula] (Table [\ref=tab:experiments]), a measure of the strength of base-state melt segregation. Except for the samples sheared to outer-radius shear strains of γ(R)  =  5.0 and 7.3, the maximum in melt fraction increases with increasing shear strain. In summary, the results presented in Figure [\ref=fig:profile]a demonstrate that, with increasing strain, the pressure gradient induced by anisotropic viscosity drives melt inward, increasing the maximum value of the azimuthally averaged melt fraction and decreasing the radius at which this maximum occurs.

Figure [\ref=fig:profile]b compares the azimuthally averaged profiles of normalized melt fraction from three samples deformed to [formula] with those derived from numerical simulations. The data points in [\ref=fig:profile]b, which are the mean values of the of the azimuthal averages at each radius, reach a maximum normalized melt fraction of ~  1.15 at [formula] mm and a minimum of ~  0.95 at r  ≈  4 mm. For comparison, radial profiles of melt fraction from numerical simulations of samples deformed to γ(R) = 5.5 at an initial compaction length of δc = 0.1R and a bulk-to-shear viscosity ratio of rξ = 10. In the simulations, two conditions are used for the angle of viscous anisotropy: (1) Θ  =   45[formula], suggested by previous experiments[\cite=takei2010], and (2) Θ  =   60[formula], suggested by Figure [\ref=fig:rose]. The other variable in the simulations is the magnitude of viscous anisotropy. In all four simulations, α increases from zero at the centre of the cylinder to [formula] at r  ≈  1 mm and then remains constant at larger radii. In two of the simulations, β mimics the behavior of α. In the other two simulations, β is zero at all radii. In the decompaction region (i.e. at small radii), profiles with Θ  =   45[formula] exhibit higher melt fractions than those with Θ  =   60[formula], while profiles with [formula] exhibit higher melt fractions than those with [formula] and β = 0. The profile with Θ  =   60[formula] and [formula] is in the most consistent with the experimental results. However, some clear differences exist between the simulated and the experimental profiles. First, for 2.6 < r < 4.4 mm the simulated profiles lie above experimentally measured profile. Second, the abrupt decrease in the simulated profiles at r > 4.4 mm was not observed experimentally. Despite these quantitative discrepancies, all simulated porosity profiles are in good qualitative agreement with those from experiments, in terms of both the amplitude and the radial position of the porosity maximum.

In this paper we presented experimental observations of the radial distribution of melt in partially molten rocks deformed in torsion to large strain. For this deformation geometry, the theory of melt segregation with anisotropic viscosity predict a radial distribution of melt fraction. The inclusion of viscous anisotropy in the theory is a necessary and sufficient condition for the development of radially inward, base-state melt segregation. Our experiments test this prediction, and the results reported here are in general agreement with theory, validating the viscous-anisotropy hypothesis. This experimental validation of MPO-induced viscous anisotropy represents a significant advance in our understanding of the relationship between microstructure and continuum mechanics of partially molten rocks, and it also exposes details of the linkage between deformation, MPO and viscosity that are not captured by present models. In Earth, partially melting largely occurs in regions of active deformation -- places where melt-preferred orientation will occur. Inclusion of viscous anisotropy in models of the dynamics of the partial molten mantle will likely predict shear-induced melt migration that profoundly influences melt segregation, mantle dynamics, and chemical evolution of our planet.

The viscosity tensor

The diffusion-creep viscosity tensor Cijkl of a partially molten rock can be calculated by using a microstructure-based model[\cite=takei2009a]. The grain coordinates (xg,yg,zg) are defined independently of the continuum coordinates (x,y,z). Each grain in the aggregate is assumed to have 14 circular contacts with equal radius. Microstructural anisotropy is represented by a decrease (or increase) in the radius of the two contact faces in the xg (or yg) direction. By substituting this contact geometry into equation (42) of Takei & Holtzman[\cite=takei2009a], Cijkl (i,j,k,l = xg,yg,zg) is calculated as

[formula]

where η and ξ correspond to the shear and bulk viscosity of an isotropic matrix, and Δ (or [formula]) represents the decrease (or increase) in viscosity in the xg (or yg) direction.

For illustration, we consider a two dimensional problem in which contiguity is increased in the σ1 direction and decreased in the σ3 direction (in other words, MPO is aligned according to the instantaneous directions of principal stress). Furthermore, we assume that the σ1-σ3 plane is parallel to the x-y plane. Let Θ be the angle between the xg and x axes. Then, by a coordinate transformation[\cite=takei2013] of expression ([\ref=eq:Cgc]), the viscosity tensor Cijkl in the continuum coordinates (i,j,k,l = x,y,z) is

[formula]

where only 21 of the 81 components are shown; the others are readily obtained from the symmetry of Cijkl. The factor in front of the matrix represents the shear viscosity η that decreases exponentially with increasing melt fraction φ. η0 represents η at reference melt fraction φ0, and λ is the porosity weakening factor. The parameter rξ  =  ξ  /  η represents the bulk-to-shear viscosity ratio. Parameters α  =  Δ  /  η and [formula] represent the magnitude of viscous anisotropy in the reduced and increased directions, respectively. Parameters rξ, α, and β are assumed to be independent of melt fraction based on the theoretical result[\cite=takei2009a] [\cite=takei2013].

When [formula] and β = 0, ([\ref=eq:Cgc]) and ([\ref=eq:Csystem]) are equal to those used in previous studies[\cite=takei2013] [\cite=katz2013]. The present formulation is more general than that one because it allows for the effect of contiguity change in the yg direction as well as the xg direction. In obtaining solutions to the governing equations, Θ is usually taken such that the xg axis is in the σ3 direction, as discussed above. However, because Θ is defined by the direction of microstructural anisotropy independently of the resultant stress, it can be used to describe a general MPO direction (Fig. [\ref=fig:rose]).

Base-state segregation in torsion

The anomalous character of the base-state melt segregation in torsion bears some elaboration. Takei & Katz[\cite=takei2013] showed that viscous anisotropy has a general tendency to cause melt segregation up a gradient in shear stress, and demonstrated the occurrence of base-state melt segregation directly driven by a gradient of shear stress. In torsion, shear stress increases with increasing radius. However, the inward melt flow is driven by the negative hoop stress, which is opposite in direction to general tendency. A detailed explanation for this anomalous result for torsion deformation is presented in Takei & Katz ([\cite=takei2013], Section 5.2). Irrespective of these subtleties, viscous anisotropy plays an essential role in the generation of the negative hoop stress that drives base-state segregation (Fig. 1). The occurrence of radially inward melt segregation in torsion can therefore be appropriately used to test the viscous anisotropy hypothesis.
