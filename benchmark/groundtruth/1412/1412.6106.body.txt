Universality of plasmon excitations in Dirac semimetals

Introduction

The discovery of Dirac semimetals, which are chiral fermions in three spatial dimensions, opens the fascinating possibility of being able to study the effects of quantum anomalies in condensed matter experiments. In particular, the presence of the chiral anomaly in (3 + 1) dimensional theory should make it possible to observe "Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME)" -- a non-dissipative current induced by parallel electric and magnetic fields -- in such systems; for a review, see [\cite=Kharzeev2014]. The studies of magneto-transport in Cd3As2 have already begun [\cite=Liang2014].

The linear spectrum of quasi-particles also opens new possibilities for photonics/plasmonics. In graphene, which is two dimensional (2D), the plasmon mode does not appear in the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) [\cite=RPA_graphene]. A plasmon does arise after doping, or the inclusion of electron-electron interactions, with a plasmon frequency that is in the terahertz (THz) range of frequency [\cite=Grigorenko2012]. This range is important for diverse practical applications ranging from medical imaging to security.

In this paper we investigate the properties of the collective plasmon excitation in three dimensional (3D) Dirac semimetals. Relative to 2D graphene, because of the extra spatial dimension a strong and narrow plasmon peak already appears in the Random Phase Approximation. At zero chemical potential and for a broad range in temperature, the plasmon frequency is approximately linear in T, and is in the THz range at room temperature.

Dirac semimetals are characterized by strong coupling and a large fermion degeneracy, N. We show that this leads to universal properties of the plasmon excitation: the plasmon spectrum does not depend on the value of the coupling constant nor upon the degeneracy, N, of the Dirac point. The reason underlying this universality is the quantum scale anomaly of relativistic field theory, where it is known as "dimensional transmutation". In Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), this phenomenon is responsible for the masses of all strongly interacting particles, and thus for ~  95% of the mass of the visible Universe.

To compute the plasmon spectrum we need a method valid at strong coupling. This is because for both 3D Dirac semimetals and for 2D graphene, the role of the fine structure constant αem  =  e2 / (4π is played by the effective coupling α  =  e2 / (4π, where v  ≪  c is the Fermi velocity. The Fermi velocity in Cd3As2 was experimentally determined[\cite=Liang2014] to be v≃9.3  ×  105 m  /  s≃1 / 300 c, close to the value in graphene. Because of this, the effective coupling constant α≃2.2 is very large. This is comparable to the value of the strong coupling constant in the Quark-Gluon Plasma, near the deconfining transition in QCD.

Generally, the photon propagator cannot be computed perturbatively in strong coupling. However, there is an alternate expansion possible. The degeneracy factor of fermion quasi-particles is large: due to the degeneracy in the electron spin and double valleys, N  =  4 for both 3D Dirac semimetals and for graphene. We can then use a large N expansion to compute the photon propagator to leading order in 1 / N. At nonzero temperature and density, the result for the photon propagator is similar to that obtained in the Hard Thermal Loop (HTL) approach to the Quark-Gluon Plasma [\cite=Pisarski1989] [\cite=Braaten1990]. The HTL approximation is used, e.g., to compute the rate of electromagnetic radiation from the Quark-Gluon Plasma [\cite=braaten1990prod]. In this paper we employ similar methods for evaluating the plasmon spectrum and damping rate in Dirac semimetals.

When the number of fermions species N is large, the photon dynamics is dominated by dressing the photon with the one loop fermion diagrams. As a result, the photon propagator is suppressed by 1 / N, and photon-mediated interactions are suppressed by 1 / N, so the fermion dynamics are those of a free theory. As long as N is sufficiently large, this remains true even at strong coupling [\cite=son2007quantum]. Further, we can neglect the scale dependence of the Fermi velocity, as that originates from loop corrections to the fermion propagator. Indeed, for graphene the suppression of the dependence of the velocity scale with 1 / N is manifest [\cite=aleiner2007spontaneous].

In the one loop approximation at large N, the longitudinal Coulomb and the transverse sectors of the plasmon decouple from one another. In the following we focus on the Coulomb sector. (We note, however, that in the static limit in which we compute, the transverse and Coulomb plasmons are degenerate.) From the above discussion, the effective coupling in the Coulomb sector is

[formula]

We emphasize here the dependence on the physical UV lattice cutoff Λc at which the observed value of the coupling is defined:

[formula]

It is well known that in a gauge theory with massless fermions there is no intrinsic notion of the coupling constant: the coupling constant changes, or "runs", as the length scale at which it is probed changes. Hence one can trade the value of the coupling constant for the dimensionful scale at which it is defined, which is known as "dimensional transmutation". For our purposes we can define this scale as that where the coupling blows up, at the Landau pole ΛL. The physical observables then depend only upon the ratio of an external scale, Q, at which the coupling is measured to ΛL. At one loop order, the coupling λ(Q) at a scale Q is given by

[formula]

The first equality in Eq. ([\ref=run_couple]) contains a Landau pole at [formula], which is where the coupling constant diverges. We can then rewrite this as the second equality in Eq. ([\ref=run_couple]), which shows that the coupling is a function solely of the ratio Q / ΛL. That is, Λc and λ(Λc) are transmuted to a single scale ΛL, which is the only dimensionful parameter of the theory. This means that at nonzero temperature T and chemical potential μ, any observable in the photon sector is of the form

[formula]

Here Δ is the mass dimension of the observable; in this paper it is the plasmon frequency, with Δ = 1. The function f(x,y) depends upon the observable in question, but is otherwise universal: all of the dependence on Λc and λ(Λc) is included in the single parameter, ΛL. It is worth emphasizing that neither N or v appears in the function f(x,y). This is most powerful, as it is then possible to find f(x,y) with ease in the one-loop approximation valid at large N. In this paper we compute the universal function f(x,y) for the plasmon frequency at zero spatial momentum. It is worth emphasizing that the "vacuum" contribution to the one loop diagram, from zero temperature and density, plays a crucial role in realizing this universality. (This is not captured by the Hard Thermal Loop limit, which neglects the vacuum contribution.)

The limit of strong coupling is defined as follows. Given the physical lattice cutoff, Λc, with a fixed e2(Λc)  ≈  0.1, a large value of N / v can give a large value of λ(Λc). Thus, in the strong coupling limit, ΛL  =  e6π2  /  λ(Λc)Λc  ≈  Λc, any observable in the photon sector at nonzero T and μ becomes

[formula]

with the same function f(x,y). That is, the result is independent of the values of N, v, or e2(Λc)  ≈  0.1. We call this a universality of strong coupling.

For N = 4 and 1 / v = 300, we have

[formula]

so that

[formula]

In spite of the uncertainty in the value of Λc, it is thus reasonable to assume that the strong coupling limit, and so Eq. ([\ref=strong]), are justified.

We now turn to a summary of the details of the computation of the plasmon frequency. The plasmon arises from the singularity in the longitudinal component of the retarded photon propagator. In Coulomb gauge, [formula], this propagator is

[formula]

The one-loop expression for the longitudinal retarded self-energy ΠLR(p) consists of two parts: the first in vacuum, at T  =  μ  =  0, and the second from T,μ  ≠  0. The explicit computation is presented in the Methods section. This shows that the solution for the plasmon frequency takes the form

[formula]

where the function f(x,y) is universal, independent of the values of the coupling constant e2(Λc), degeneracy N, and the Fermi velocity v.

For small [formula] the function f(x,y) can be found analytically which agrees with the HTL with running coupling constant. The result is

[formula]

For a general x and y, f(x,y) is complex valued; we have evaluated it numerically as described in Methods. The resulting real and imaginary parts of the plasmon energy, normalized to the temperature T, are presented in Fig. ([\ref=fig1]) as a function of log (ΛL / T)  =   log (1 / x).

In Fig. ([\ref=fig2]) we present the plasmon frequency in physical units of terahertz (THz) as a function of temperature at zero chemical potential and at a chemical potential of μ  =  200 meV, which is characteristic for Cd3As2[\cite=Borisenko2014] [\cite=Neupane2014]. For the case of zero chemical potential, we see that by changing the temperature, the plasmon frequency can be tuned from the radio wave to the near infrared range of the spectrum. In this entire frequency range, the damping of the plasmon is weak, with γ  /  ωpl  <  0.05, so the plasmon peak is very narrow.

Let us first estimate numerically the magnitude of the plasmon frequency that we have derived. The UV cutoff in the energy spectrum of quasiparticles indicated by the ARPES measurements in Cd3As2 is Λc≃5 eV≃5.8  ×  104 K. For the dimensionful scale ΛL we thus get ΛL≃1.65 Λc≃105 K, see Eq. ([\ref=num_lam]). For the room temperature of T≃300 K we get log (ΛL / T)≃5.7. Fig. ([\ref=fig1]) then yields the plasmon frequency of ωpl≃T≃6 THz ≃0.5 - 1. We have thus found that for room temperature Cd3As2 possesses the plasmon in the terahertz frequency range, which may have important applications for THz imaging. It is known that Cd3As2 undergoes a phase change at the temperature of T≃888 K [\cite=Hiscocks69]. For this temperature, we get log (ΛL / T)≃4.7, and from Fig. ([\ref=fig1]) the plasmon frequency is still ωpl≃T, which at this higher temperature yields a higher frequency ωpl≃18 THz. At a low temperature of T  =  3K, we get log (ΛL / T)≃10.4, and from Fig. ([\ref=fig1]) the plasmon frequency is ωpl≃T which yields a low frequency of ωpl≃60 GHz ≃1 - 1 which is in the radio frequency range.

In summary, plasmons in Dirac semimetals provide a link between the quantum dynamics of relativistic field theories and photonics. Depending on the chemical potential, which can be controlled by doping, Dirac semimetals can be used as sensors or emitters of electromagnetic radiation in a broad frequency range, between radio waves, ~  100 GHz, and near infrared, 50 THz.

Methods

Consider the longitudinal component of the retarded photon propagator in Coulomb gauge, [formula], as given in Eq. ([\ref=pi00]). The contribution in vacuum, at T  =  μ  =  0, is

[formula]

The square of the four momentum is [formula]. Λc  ≈  5    eV  ≈  105    K is the ultraviolet cutoff in the energy spectrum of chiral quasiparticles, with the value indicated by the ARPES data on Cd3As2[\cite=Borisenko2014] [\cite=Neupane2014].

The second part is the contribution from T, μ  ≠  0. After rescaling the spatial momentum integration variable from [formula] to [formula], this is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

where N(k) = (e(k - μ) / T + 1)- 1  +  (e(k + μ) / T + 1)- 1 is the sum of the Fermi-Dirac statistical distribution functions for particles and antiparticles (holes). In principle, the integration over k has ultraviolet cutoff from the lattice. However, as N(k) is Boltzmann suppressed at large momenta, we can extend the integration range to infinity, up to exponentially small corrections. The x integration can be explicitly computed by logarithms. In the limit of small spatial momenta, [formula], this becomes

[formula]

In the limit of [formula], then, the equation for the pole in the longitudinal propagator becomes

[formula]

As discussed previously, λ  =  Ne2 / v appears naturally. Also, the vacuum term reflects the running of the coupling constant. The above equation can be rewritten as

[formula]

In this expression, all other parameters disappear, and are replaced by the single scale ΛL  ≈  1.65Λc. From the above equation, it is clear that the solution for the plasmon frequency takes the universal form

[formula]

We determine the function f(x,y) shortly. This is an explicit demonstration of the universality which we argued above. To see the emergence of the form given by Eq. ([\ref=univ]) more clearly, we change the integration variable k  →  k̄  =  k / T, introduce μ̄  =  μ / T, and write the Eq. ([\ref=eq]) as

[formula]

[formula]

where 0 = p0 / T.

The above equation is our starting point to find the universal function f(x,y) for the plasmon frequency. We emphasize that it is the full expression to one loop order in the static limit, [formula].

Before presenting our numerical solution for f(x,y), it is instructive to study its behavior for x  ≪  1 and x  ≫  1 at fixed y. For x  ≪  1, one can replace the logarithm in the equation by 2 log x; we can then neglect 0  ≪  1 in the k integration, so that the equation becomes

[formula]

which gives

[formula]

For x  ≫  1, again we replace the logarithm by 2 log x, as then 0  ≪  1, and the k integration is the same as before. There is no consistent real solution in this case since log x > 0. Therefore, the real part of f(x,y) ceases to exist for x > xc with some critical number xc, equivalently for a temperature T > Tc = xcΛL. That is, plasmons do not exist in this case.

For a general x and y, f(x,y) is complex valued. For x  ≪  1 it is easy to find that its imaginary part is sub-leading compared to the real part of Eq. ([\ref=xl1]). As x increases, the imaginary part becomes larger, and eventually dominates for x  ≫  1. In our numerical analysis we find that the imaginary part is always small relative to the real part, so that it can be determined in a linear approximation.

The result of Eq. ([\ref=xl1]) can also be obtained by using the HTL approximation with a running coupling constant. The HTL result for the plasmon frequency is

[formula]

If we use the running coupling of Eq. ([\ref=run_couple]) in Eq. ([\ref=pl_htl]),

[formula]

then we reproduce the expressions of Eqs. ([\ref=univ]) and ([\ref=xl1]).

Writing

[formula]

the equation for the real part of [formula] is

[formula]

where P denotes a principal value integration. With [formula] found, in linear approximation the damping rate γ is

[formula]

In Figures ([\ref=fig1]) and ([\ref=fig2]) we show the numerical plots of f(x,y) at fixed μ = yT. The real part of f(x,y) (pl) ceases to exist for x > xc  ≈  0.13 with the maximum value around 3.5. In the most relevant region of x with [formula], the imaginary part (the damping rate   =  γ / T) is indeed less than 5% of the real part, so the plasmons are narrow and so well defined excitations.
