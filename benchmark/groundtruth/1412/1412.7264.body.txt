On k-transitive closures of directed paths

We use the standard notation. By an edge we mean an unoriented pair of vertices, and by an arc we mean an oriented pair of vertices. For a given graph G, V(G) and E(G) denotes the set of its vertices and the set of its edges, respectivly. For a digraph G, we write A(G) for the set of its arcs. By an oriented graph we mean such a digraph that if (a,b) is an arc, then (b,a) is not. All graphs and digraphs in this paper are finite.

Motivation

Orientation of a graph G is called transitive if for every (a,b)∈A(G), (b,c)∈A(G), also (a,c)∈A(G). This concept was studied by many authors in numerous papers, see the survey [\cite=Kelly1985] for example. The concept of transitive orientation was generalized in several ways in [\cite=GyarfasJacobsonKinch1988] and [\cite=Tuza1994], [\cite=Hernandez-Cruz2012], and other papers.

A digraph is called k-transitive if every directed path of the length k has a shortcut joining the beginning and the end of this path. In other words, if [formula] is a path in the digraph G, then (v0,vk)∈A(G).

Note that our term "-transitive" coresponds to "(k,1)-transitive" in [\cite=GyarfasJacobsonKinch1988] and [\cite=Tuza1994].

A -transitive closure of an oriented graph G = (V,A) is an oriented graph [formula] such that

[formula],

[formula],

[formula] is -transitive ,

and it has the minimal (by inclusion) set of arcs among all graphs with the above stated properties.

Observe that there are oriented graphs for which the -transitive closure does not exist. For example in a cyclically oriented cycle Ck + 1 it is not possible to add arcs to fulfill the condition ([\ref=ktrans_indef]).

If the -transitive closure does exist for some oriented graph, it is unique.

Note that this definition is a partial answer to the point (4) in [\cite=GyarfasJacobsonKinch1988].

The aim of this paper is to describe -transitive closures of directed paths.

Structure of the -transitive closure of the directed path

Instead of [formula] we write  to denote the -transitive closure of an oriented path on n vertices. We label the vertices by natural numbers [formula] and assume that (i,i + 1)∈A(Pn - 1) for 1  ≤  i < n.

Although the graph  is oriented, some of the properties will be stated for simple graphs obtained by "forgetting" the orientation. We belive that it is clear from the context, but to be precise, for the unoriented case we write .

In this paper by a degree sequence of a graph  we mean a sequence [formula]. (In/out)degree sequence of a graph  is defined in a similiar way.

Observe that [formula] is just the complete graph Kn, and [formula] is the tournament on n vertices.

The starting point in a construction of the -transitive closure of the path Pn - 1 is to add arcs (i,i + k). Then we add arcs (i,i + 2k - 1), at the next stage arcs (i,i + 3k - 2), and so on. This construction shows that for every [formula],  is well defined.

The key observations are:

Adding one vertex to the path adds only arcs ending in this new vertex. In other words, [formula] is an induced subgraph of .

In the graph , [formula] iff j - i = 1 + l(k - 1) for some 0  ≤  l  ≤  (n - 2) / (k - 1).

It follows directly from the construction described above that

[formula]

To show the other inclusion we use the induction on n. First observe that for n  ≤  k all arcs are of the form (i,i + 1). Assume that all arcs in (k:n - 1) have the length 1 + l(k - 1) for some l  ≥  0. To obtain a k-shortcut in  we need k arcs, each of them of length 1 + li(k - 1), li  ≥  0. So [formula].

In Figure [\ref=kns511] we present the graph  as an example.

Some properties

From the observations mentioned above, we conclude several properties of graphs  and .

For n  ≤  k, [formula]. So for n  ≤  k, the graph  is just the path Pn - 1.

We can observe the following block structure in indegree/outdegree sequences of graphs :

The proof follows from Facts [\ref=lengthofshortcut] and [\ref=induced]. We prove the part concerning the indegree sequence. First note that the indegree of the first vertex is 0. For the next k - 1 vertices there is no arcs ending in them other than the arcs in the initial path, so their indegree is 1. First vertex of indegree 2 is the (k + 1)-th vertex. First vertex of indegree 3 is the 2k-th vertex, and first vertex of indegree j is the ((j - 1)(k - 1) + 2)-th vertex.

The proof for the outdegree sequence is similiar; we just start from the last vertex.

This is a consequence of Theorem [\ref=orienteddegreesequences]; just observe that summing up the indegree and outdegree sequences gives the constant sequence [formula].

This is another consequence of Theorem [\ref=orienteddegreesequences].

As an example, below are the degree sequences for -transitive closures of the paths on 10,11,12,13 and 14 vertices:

for : (3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3); 10 = 2 + 2(5 - 1) + 0, l = 2 and m = 0, by Corollary [\ref=regular] this graph is 2+1=3 regular;

for : (3,4,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,4,3); 11 = 2 + 2(5 - 1) + 1, l = 2 and m = 1, by Corollary [\ref=twodegrees] this sequence is built from repeated blocks (3,4,3,3);

for : (3,4,4,3,3,4,4,3,3,4,4,3); 12 = 2 + 2(5 - 1) + 2, l = 2 and m = 2, by Corollary [\ref=twodegrees] this sequence is built from repeated blocks (3,4,4,3);

for : (3,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,3); 13 = 2 + 2(5 - 1) + 3, l = 2 and m = 3, by Corollary [\ref=twodegrees] this sequence is built from repeated blocks (3,4,4,4);

for : (4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4); 14 = 2 + 3(5 - 1) + 0, l = 3 and m = 0, by Corollary [\ref=regular] this graph is 3+1=4 regular.

Recall that by degree of a vertex v in a digraph we mean a pair [formula].

For oriented graphs  we can observe the following:

For example, the degree sequence for is (3,4,4,3,3,4,4,3,3,4,4,3), and the degree sequence for is ((0,3),(1,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,2),(2,2),(2,2),(2,1), (2,1),(3,1),(3,1),(3,0)).

Recall that an oriented graph G is irregular if for every two vertices vi,vj∈V(G), vi  ≠  vj, their degrees are different.

Strightforward consequence of Corollary [\ref=orienteddegree] is that graphs  for k > 3 are not irregular. The natural question is: are the graphs irregular? The answer is:

By Theorem [\ref=orienteddegreesequences], pairs of vertices 2i,2i + 1 for 1  ≤  i  <  n / 2 have the same indegree. Because for the even n the graph is regular, so is not irregular if n is even.

Also by Theorem [\ref=orienteddegreesequences], [formula] for 1  ≤  i  <  n / 2. By Corollary [\ref=twodegrees], for the odd n the degree sequence of the graph is of the form [formula]. So for n odd, if for some two vertices their total degrees are equal then its indegrees are different. Hence is irregular if n is odd.

Recall that the tournament  is irregular for any n.

Density

By density of the graph G, |V(G)| = n, we mean ratio "number of edges in the graph G"/"number of edges in complete graph Kn"; in symbols [formula].

Recall then for every even n, a graph  is [formula]-regular. We have [formula] edges. So for even n, [formula].

For every odd n, in a graph  there are [formula] vertices of degree [formula] and [formula] vertices of degree [formula]. We have [formula] edges. So for odd n, [formula].

Observe that in both cases the density is bigger then 1 / 2 and

[formula]

We have the following:

By Corollary [\ref=howmany],

[formula]

By standard calculation we get

[formula]

Recall that n = 2 + l(k - 1) + m, where k and m are fixed, so when l  →    ∞  , then also n  →    ∞  . So [formula]

Obviously, for k = 2, [formula].

Open problems

The main open problem concerning -transitive closures in general, is to state what properties of an oriented graph G guarantee the existence of [formula].

There are also some other special classes of oriented graphs, such as cycles (with different orientations) and trees, for which there is a chance to obtain interested properties for their k-transitive closures.
