Introduction

The goal of the current work is to show that any (in general, nonlinear) code that can correct at least one error is a subcode of a 1-perfect code of some larger length. Moreover, we prove a similar result for the partitions into 1-error-correcting codes. In [\cite=AvgKro:embed], the possibility to embed into 1-perfect code was proven for binary codes. In [\cite=Rom:2012], the ternary case was solved; for the q-ary case with q > 3, there are similar embedding results in [\cite=Rom:2012], but with the restriction that the embedded code is required to be at least 2-error-correcting (this restriction is very strict as almost all 1-error-correcting codes are not 2-error-correcting). The reason of such restriction is that the method suggested in [\cite=AvgKro:embed] does not work in general case: the components that should be switched in the linear 1-perfect code to build the required subcode can intersect in the case q > 3 (see Remark [\ref=rem:intersect]). To avoid this problem, we suggest a modification of the method.

We will follow the convenient notation and line of reasoning from [\cite=AvgKro:embed] with three main differences. At first, the key definition of a linear i-component (in our notation, we will write a Greek letter instead of traditional i) is now given in a usual form [\cite=PheVil:2002:q], while the required property is declared in Lemma [\ref=l:comp] (the definition based on this property would look complicate in the q-ary case). At second, the formulation of the crucial proposition, which is essentially the main and largest part of the proof of the main theorem, is different from the crucial lemma in the binary case (as was noted above, the last one does not work in the general case, see also Remark [\ref=rem:intersect]). At third, we add the theorem about embedding partitions, which is new for all q, including q = 2.

Notation and definitions

Over the article, we will use the following notation.

F denotes the Galois field [formula] of order q.

Fm is the set of m-tuples over F, considered as a vector space over F. The elements of Fm are denoted by Greek letters.

[formula] consists of m-tuples from Fm with the first nonzero element equal to 1.

The intersection of [formula] with a 2-dimensional subspace of Fm will be referred to as a line. The cardinality of every line is q + 1. The set of lines together with the set of the points [formula] form an incidence structure, known as the projective geometry [formula].

The intersection of [formula] with a 3-dimensional subspace Fm will be referred to as a plane.

[formula].

[formula] is the natural basis in Fm.

The elements of Fn will be denoted by overlined letters with the coordinates indexed by the elements of [formula]. We assume that the first m coordinates have the indexes [formula], while the other n - m coordinates are ordered in some arbitrary fixed way.

[formula] is the natural basis in Fn, herewith ē(π(δ)) = (π(δ),0n - m).

For any [formula], we define [formula]; moreover [formula].

The Hamming distance d(x,  y) is the number of positions in which vectors x, y from the same space differ.

The neighborhood Ω(M) of a set M  ⊂  Fn is the set of the vectors at distance at most 1 from M.

A set C  ⊂  Fm is called a 1-code if the neighborhoods of the codewords are disjoint.

A 1-code P  ⊂  Fn is called a 1-perfect code if Ω(P) = Fn.

The Hamming code Hm of length n is defined as the set of vectors ∈Fn satisfying the following equation:

[formula]

[formula].

[formula]. The elements of T are called triples.

[formula].

The linear δ-component Rδ is defined as the linear span < Tδ  >  . By an δ-component of the Hamming code, we will mean any coset of the linear δ-component that is a subset of the Hamming code.

Preliminaries

For any ∈Fn it holds that Ω(Rδ  +  ) = Ω(Rδ  +    +  μē(δ)) for all μ∈F.

Without loss of generality it is enough to prove the statement for  = 0n. It is shown in [\cite=PheVil:2002:q] that [formula] is a 1-perfect code for all μ∈F. From the definition of the 1-perfect code it follows that the neighborhoods of the sets Rδ and Rδ  +  μē(δ) are equal. So the statement of Lemma is true.

Let [formula]. Every word [formula] from Rδ satisfies the relation

[formula]

for all linear functions l from Fm to F such that l(δ) = 0 and all lines [formula] containing δ.

Since Rδ is a subset of the Hamming code, each of its elements [formula] satisfies ([\ref=eq:hammingcode]). Then

[formula]

holds for any linear function l. Now assume l(δ) = 0 and consider a line [formula] containing δ. Then, the support of every triple from Tδ either is included in [formula] or intersect with [formula] in only one element δ. In the last case, ([\ref=eq:for-comp]) is trivial; in the former case, it trivially follows from ([\ref=eq:partial]). Since the required relation holds for every element of Tδ, we see from linearity that it holds for the linear span of Tδ, i.e., for Rδ.

Let δ, [formula]. Every element [formula] of <  Rδ,Rκ  >   satisfies the relation

[formula]

for all linear functions l from Fm to F such that l(δ) = l(κ) = 0 and all planes [formula] containing δ and κ.

First consider the case ∈Rδ. Summarizing ([\ref=eq:for-comp]) over the all lines containing δ and included in [formula], we get ([\ref=eq:for-comp2]). So, the elements of Rδ and, similarly, the elements of Rκ satisfy ([\ref=eq:for-comp2]). By the linearity, the elements of <  Rδ,Rκ  >   do.

Embedding in a 1-perfect code

Assume that δ and κ from Fm both start with 1 and the distance between them is at least 3. Then the δ-component Rδ  +    -  ēδ and the κ-component Rκ  +    -  ēκ are disjoint.

Consider the vector difference  = (  -  ē(δ))  -  (  -  ē(κ)). It is sufficient to show that [formula]. We will show that [formula] does not satisfy ([\ref=eq:for-comp2]). Note that the first element of [formula] is 0, and cπ(i)  ≠  0 if and only if δi  ≠  κi. Among the other coordinates (not from Π), [formula] has exactly two nonzero positions, δ and κ. Now consider some i such that cπ(i)  ≠  0. Note that π(i), δ and κ are linearly independent (indeed, a nontrivial linear combination of δ and κ is either nonzero in the first position or a multiple of δ  -  κ, which has at least three nonzeros and thus cannot coincide with π(i)); hence there is a unique plane P containing π(i), δ and κ.

Now we state that π(i), δ and κ are the only points of P in which [formula] is not equal to zero. Indeed, assume that [formula]. If a + b  ≠  0 then β1  ≠  0 and thus either β∈{δ,κ} or cβ  =  0 holds. If a + b  =  0 then aδ  +  bκ  =  a(δ  -  κ) and thus, by the hypothesis of the proposition, this combination has at list three nonzero positions. In this case, β has at least two nonzero positions, and thus does not belong to Π. Hence, cβ  =  0.

Then we consider a linear function l such that l(δ) = l(κ) = 0  ≠  l(π(i)) and see that ([\ref=eq:for-comp2]) cannot hold as it has only one nonzero summand, α  =  π(i).

The hypothesis that both δ and κ start with 1 is necessary in Proposition [\ref=p:disjoint] for q > 3. For example let us consider δ  =  (1,1,1) and κ  =  (t,t2,t2)  =  t(1,t,t)  =  tγ, where t2 is different from 1 and t (so, q  ≥  4). Then the vectors [formula] and [formula] are at distance 1 from the δ-component [formula] and the γ-component [formula] of the Hamming code. It is easy to see that the nonzero coordinates π(1), π(2), π(3), δ and γ of the difference [formula] belong to the same plain. Hence, since this difference is from the Hamming code, we see that it satisfies ([\ref=eq:for-comp2]). It is not difficult to conclude that the corresponding components intersect.

Let C  ⊂  Fm - 1 be a 1-code. Define [formula]. Then the following set

[formula]

is a 1-perfect code in Fn, within

[formula]

It is clear that   -  ē(δ)∈Hm for all [formula], which means Rδ  +    -  ē(δ)  ⊂  Hm for all δ. According to Proposition [\ref=p:disjoint] the sets Rδ  +    -  ē(δ) are mutually disjoint for all [formula]. As they are subsets of a 1-perfect code, their neighborhoods are also mutually disjoint. From Lemma [\ref=l:compneighborhood] we see that P(C) is a 1-perfect code.

To prove ([\ref=eq:origincode]), we first note that  = (α,0n - m)∈Hm implies α = 0m, which follows from the definition of Hamming code. Finally, we need to show that if for some x∈Fm - 1 we have (1,x,0n - m)∈Rδ  +  , then (1,x) = δ. Indeed, if (1,x,0n - m)∈Rδ  +   then (1,x,0n - m) - ∈Rδ  ⊂  Hm, which only holds for (1,x) = δ. This completes the proof.

Partitions

Let [formula] be a partition of Fs into 1-codes. Then there is a partition [formula] of Fn into 1-perfect codes of length n = (qs + 1 - 1) / (q - 1) such that for all [formula],

[formula]

Put m = s + 1. Let for all α from Fm, Hα be the coset of the Hamming code that contains [formula]; so, {Hα}α∈Fm is a partition of Fn. Let us choose k distinct vectors y1, , yk from Fs, and denote αj = (0,yj), [formula]. Using Theorem [\ref=th:code], we replace the code Hαj by P(Cj - yj) + j. Then, this code will be the js element Pj of the constructed partition; readily, ([\ref=eq:part]) is straightforward from ([\ref=eq:origincode]). It remains to replace the other cosets of the Hamming code to get a partition. According to the definition of Pj, it intersects with the following cosets of the Hamming code: with Hαj and, for every x from Cj, with H(1,x), which has a common component with Pj. Let Ox be obtained from H(1,x) by removing this component, and by including the corresponding component (the one that is not in Pj) of Hαj. Now we see that the |Cj| + 1 codes Hαj and Ox, x∈Cj, are mutually disjoint and

[formula]

Then, the codes Pj, [formula], together with the codes Ox, x∈Fm - 1, and the codes Hα, where α does not start with 1 and is different from all αj, [formula], form a partition of Fn. As was noted above, ([\ref=eq:part]) holds.

Note that, since the number k of codes in the original partition can be rather large, up to qs, the length n for which it is possible to construct the embedding cannot be small too: the number (q - 1)n + 1 of perfect codes in the resulting partition cannot be smaller than qs. So, [formula], and we see that our construction gives an embedding with "almost" minimal length [formula]. Using the same approach and based on the results of [\cite=AvgKro:embed] and [\cite=Rom:2012], one can construct an embedding of minimal length for the cases q = 2 and q = 3, respectively.

Finally, we note that Theorem [\ref=th:to-part] is the most general known formulation that generalize Theorem [\ref=th:code] and, in particular, the result of [\cite=AvgKro:embed] (putting aside small increasing of the embedding length) and some results of [\cite=Rom:2012]. As noted in [\cite=AvgKro:embed], the classical results [\cite=Treash:TStoSTS] and [\cite=Ganter:QStoSQS] about embedding in Steiner triple systems and Steiner quadruple systems respectively can also be treated as partial cases of this theorem.
