Controlling for unmeasured confounding and spatial misalignment in long-term air pollution and health studies

Introduction

The health effects of air pollution came to public prominence in the mid 1900's, as a result of high-pollution episodes in the Meuse Valley in Belgium, Donora, Pennsylvania, and London, England. The latter occurred from 4th - 10th December 1952, and is estimated to have resulted in around 12,000 excess deaths compared with preceding years ([\citealp=bell2001]). Although air pollution concentrations are now much lower than in the mid 1900's in much of the world, air pollution remains a global public health problem. For example, in April 2014 the World Health Organisation estimated that outdoor air pollution was responsible for the deaths of 3.7 million people under the age of 60 in 2012. These health effect estimates are based on evidence from a large number of epidemiological studies, which collectively have estimated the health impact of exposure in both the short and the long term. The health impact of long-term exposure has typically been estimated using cohort studies (see [\citealp=cesaroni2014] and [\citealp=dockery1993]), but the long-term follow up period required for the cohort makes them time consuming and expensive to implement. Therefore, spatial ecological study designs have recently been used to quantify the health impact of long-term exposure to air pollution, and examples include [\cite=elliott2007] and [\cite=lee2009]. These spatial ecological studies are inexpensive and quick to implement, due to the now routine availability of the required data. Thus, while they cannot provide individual-level evidence on cause and effect, they independently corroborate the body of evidence provided by cohort studies about the long-term impact of air pollution.

Spatial ecological studies are based on geographical contrasts in both air pollution concentrations and disease risks, over a set of non-overlapping areal units. The disease data take the form of aggregated counts of adverse health events, meaning that Poisson log-linear models are typically used for the analysis. The spatial pattern in disease risk is modelled by known covariates and a set of spatially autocorrelated random effects, the former including air pollution concentrations and measures of socio-economic deprivation and demography. The network of air pollution monitors is typically sparse relative to the number of areal units at which disease counts are measured, so modelled concentrations on a regular grid from atmospheric dispersion models are commonly used instead (see [\citealp=lee2009] and [\citealp=haining2010]). The random effects account for any spatial autocorrelation and overdispersion (with respect to the Poisson likelihood) remaining in the disease data after the covariate effects have been accounted for, which could be caused by unmeasured confounding, neighbourhood effects and grouping effects. This spatial autocorrelation is typically allowed for by modelling the random effects with a conditional autoregressive (CAR, [\cite=besag1991]) prior distribution, as part of a hierarchical Bayesian model. A relatively small number of spatial ecological studies have been published to date (for example [\citealp=jerrett2005], [\citealp=maheswaran2005], [\citealp=elliott2007], [\citealp=janes2007], [\citealp=lee2009], [\citealp=young2009], [\citealp=greven2011], [\citealp=lawson2012]), but the majority suffer from potential statistical limitations that could bias the estimated health risks.

The first potential limitation of many existing models is their approach to dealing with the residual spatial autocorrelation in the data after the known covariate effects have been accounted for. Existing research by [\cite=clayton1993] has shown the potential for collinearity between spatially smooth random effects and any covariate in the model that is also spatially smooth, such as air pollution. This potential collinearity can lead to variance inflation and instability in the estimation of the air pollution effect. Additionally, the residual autocorrelation in the disease data is not necessarily globally spatially smooth, because the disease data are unlikely to be globally smooth and part of any smooth variation has been removed by including air pollution in the model. Instead, the residual autocorrelation is likely to be localised, and be strong between some pairs of adjacent areal units whilst other adjacent pairs exhibit very different residual values. Thus global smoothing models are insufficiently flexible to capture this localised spatial autocorrelation. The second statistical limitation arises because the pollution and disease data are spatially misaligned, as the modelled concentrations are available on a regular grid while the disease counts relate to irregularly shaped administrative units. The modelled pollution concentrations are typically at a finer spatial scale than the disease counts, resulting in variation in the pollution concentrations within an areal unit. This within-area variation in concentrations has been ignored by the majority of existing studies which compute the average concentration in each areal unit, and only [\cite=haining2010] have allowed for such variation in this setting.

Therefore this paper makes two important contributions to the literature on spatial air pollution epidemiology. Firstly, it presents a novel overarching Bayesian model for spatial air pollution and health studies, which is the first of its type to simultaneously address the dual problems of capturing localised residual spatial autocorrelation and spatial misalignment between the pollution and disease data. We also provide software to implement our overarching model, via functionality in the CARBayes software package for the statistical software R ([\citealp=R]). Secondly, we present the first comprehensive comparative assessment of the range of state of the art models used in the literature, and quantify the likely nature and size of any bias in their estimated pollution-health relationships. The statistical modelling issues are motivated by a new study quantifying the effect of air pollution concentrations on respiratory ill health in England in 2010, and the data for this study are presented in Section 2. Section 3 outlines the statistical modelling challenges in such studies, summarises the methods that have been proposed, and describes the overarching model for which software is available. Section 4 quantifies the impact of inappropriate statistical modelling on the estimated air pollution effect, while the results of the England study are presented in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper with areas for future work.

Data description

The model developed in this paper is motivated by a new study investigating the health impact of long-term exposure to air pollution in England in 2010, which had a population of 52.6 million people. Hospital admission records from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (www.hscic.gov.uk) were analysed at the UK Met Office to provide counts of hospital admissions by local authority, where the primary diagnosis was circulatory or respiratory disease and where the method of admission was as an emergency. The resulting disease data are aggregated counts of the numbers of hospital admissions from respiratory disease (International Classification of Disease tenth revision codes J00-J99) in 2010 across the n = 323 Local and Unitary Authorities (LUA) that make up mainland England. Differences in the population sizes and demographic structures between areal units are accounted for by computing the expected number of hospital admissions for each LUA based on national age and sex specific admission rates. Based on these data an exploratory measure of disease risk is the Standardised Morbidity Ratio (SMR), which for area k is the ratio of the observed to the expected numbers of disease cases. The SMR is summarised in the top left panel of Figure [\ref=data1] and Table [\ref=data2], the former displaying the SMR as a choropleth map. The figure shows that the highest risk areas are cities in the north and central parts of England, such as Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester. In contrast, the lowest risk areas are typically rural, and include West Somerset in the far south west of the country. The SMR map shows evidence of localised spatial smoothness, with some pairs of neighbouring areal units exhibiting similar risks while other pairs have vastly different values.

Modelled yearly average concentrations of a number of pollutants at a resolution of 1 kilometre grid squares are available for this study, and were produced by [\cite=AEA2011] and are available to download from http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/pcm-data. The pollutants we consider in this study are nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter, the latter being measured as particles less than 2.5μm- 3 (PM2.5) and 10μm- 3 (PM10) respectively. These modelled background concentrations have complete spatial coverage of England, and the top right panel of Figure [\ref=data1] displays the PM2.5 concentrations from which the major cities and motorway network can be clearly seen. These data are thus spatially misaligned to the respiratory disease data, and the bottom left panel of Figure [\ref=data1] displays the number of modelled pollution concentrations lying within each LUA. The figure shows that on average there are 215 pollution values for each LUA, with a range from 11 to 4889. The distribution of means and coefficients of variation (standard deviation divided by the mean) in the 1 kilometre values within each of the 323 LUA are displayed in Table [\ref=data2], which shows that the greatest relative levels of within LUA variation in concentrations come from NO2. The relationships between the mean and variance of each pollutant within a LUA are positive and linear, with correlation coefficients of 0.61 (NO2), 0.48 (PM2.5) and 0.16 (PM10) respectively. These positive mean-variance relationships will determine the appropriate functional form of the pollution-health model proposed in Section 3.

Finally, socio-economic deprivation is known to have a major impact on disease risk, and here we control for it using two proxy measures. The first is the percentage of the working age population in each LUA that are in receipt of Job Seekers Allowance (JSA), which Table [\ref=data2] shows ranges between 5.77% and 27.57%. The second is the natural log of the average property price in each LUA, which on the original scale ranges between £67,507 and £751,630. A natural log transformation is used here because exploratory analyses showed it exhibited a stronger relationship with disease risk. These covariates were included in a Poisson generalised linear model along with PM2.5 concentrations, and the residuals are displayed in the bottom right panel of Figure [\ref=data1]. The residuals exhibit strong spatial autocorrelation, with a significant Moran's I statistic of 0.282 (p-value 0.00001). However, the autocorrelation is visually localised, with some pairs of neighbouring regions having very different residual values. Thus a model that accounts for this localised residual spatial autocorrelation is required, and such a model is proposed in Section 3.

Modelling

This section outlines a new Bayesian hierarchical model for estimating the health effects of air pollution in spatial ecological studies, which is the first of its type to simultaneously address the dual problems of, potentially localised, residual spatial autocorrelation in the disease data after accounting for known covariates, and spatial misalignment between the pollution and disease data resulting in within-area variation in the pollution concentrations. The first part of this section presents the general likelihood model, while the second and third parts describe the spatial autocorrelation and pollution-health components of the model respectively. The model class proposed here is implemented in the R software environment, via the freely available CARBayes package.

Level 1 - Likelihood model

The study region is partitioned into [formula] areal units, and the vectors of observed and expected numbers of disease cases across the n units are denoted by [formula] and [formula] respectively. The latter account for differences in the size and demographic structure of the populations living in each areal unit, and are computed by external standardisation using age and sex specific disease rates for the whole study region. Let [formula] denote the set of modelled air pollution data for the entire study region, where [formula] is the vector of pollution concentrations observed at qk different locations within the kth area unit. These data are used to estimate [formula], the vector of random variables representing the distributions of air pollution concentrations within each of the n areal units at which disease data are observed. Finally, [formula] is a matrix of p known covariates including measures of deprivation and a column of ones for the intercept term, where [formula] are the values for area k. Poisson log-linear models are typically used to estimate the health impact of air pollution as the disease data are counts, and here we propose the general specification:

[formula]

The relative risk of disease in area k is denoted by Rk, and Rk = 1.2 corresponds to a 20% increased risk of disease compared with the expected disease cases Ek. The vector of covariate effects are denoted by [formula], and are typically assigned a multivariate Gaussian prior with weakly informative hyper parameters [formula]. The two key modelling challenges for these data relate to the remaining model components, and are the focus of the remainder of this section. The first of these is the vector [formula], which accounts for any spatial autocorrelation or overdispersion remaining in the data after the covariate effects have been accounted for, and is discussed in Section 3.2. The second is the focus of Section 3.3, and is the modelling mechanism [formula] that relates the observed air pollution concentrations [formula], which are realisations of the random variable Wk, to the disease counts, whilst accounting for the spatial misalignment of these data.

Level 2 - Spatial autocorrelation model

The vector of random effects [formula] is typically assumed to be a globally spatially smooth process, but [\cite=clayton1993] and [\cite=reich2006] have shown the potential for collinearity between [formula] and any covariate in the model such as air pollution that is spatially smooth, leading to variance inflation and bias in the estimated covariate effects. This problem is likely to arise here, because yearly mean background pollution concentrations are spatially smooth after being averaged over LUAs. Additionally, the residuals from fitting a simple Poisson generalised linear model to the England data are spatially autocorrelated (see Section 2), but Figure [\ref=data1] shows this autocorrelation is localised and not a globally smooth surface.

Therefore we propose modelling [formula] as locally and not globally smooth, so that two random effects in adjacent LUA can be either spatially autocorrelated or exhibit very different values, with the choice being determined by the data. We achieve this by partitioning [formula] into a globally smooth surface and a piecewise constant intercept surface, which allows neighbouring areas (k,i) to have very similar values (φk,φi) if they have the same intercept or very different if they have different intercepts. The piecewise constant intercept surface has at most G distinct intercepts, [formula], and the model we propose is given by:

[formula]

The piecewise constant intercept term [formula] is ordered as [formula] to mitigate against the label switching problem common in mixture models, and in ([\ref=equation_localCAR]) λ0 =  -   ∞   and λG + 1  =    ∞  . Area k is assigned to one of the G intercepts by [formula], and here we fix the number of different intercepts G to be overly large and penalise Zk towards the middle intercept value. This is achieved by the penalty term δ(Zk - G*)2 in the prior for Zk, where G* = (G + 1) / 2 is the middle of the intercept terms. A weakly informative uniform prior with a large range is specified for the penalty parameter δ, so that the data play the dominant role in estimating its value. The second component in [formula], [formula] captures spatially smooth structure, and is modelled by the Conditional autoregressive (CAR, [\citealp=besag1991]) prior proposed by [\cite=leroux1999]. Spatial autocorrelation is induced into these random effects via a binary n  ×  n neighbourhood matrix [formula], where wki = 1 if areal units (k,i) share a common border (denoted k  ~  i) and wki = 0 otherwise (denoted [formula]). CAR priors are commonly specified as full conditional distributions, [formula] for [formula], where [formula], and are a special case of a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF). In ([\ref=equation_localCAR]) ρ is a global spatial smoothness parameter, where ρ = 1 corresponds to the intrinsic CAR prior for strong spatial smoothing proposed by [\cite=besag1991], while ρ = 0, corresponds to independent random effects. The global level of spatial autocorrelation imposed by this model can be seen from its implied partial autocorrelation between (θk,θi), which is given by:

[formula]

Here, for all pairs of adjacent areal units (k,i), wki = 1, and hence they are partially autocorrelated with the level of that autocorrelation controlled globally for all adjacent pairs by ρ.

A number of alternatives have been proposed for modelling residual spatial autocorrelation in existing spatial ecological studies, and we provide a brief review here and compare their relative performances in a simulation study in Section 4. The simplest approach is to ignore the spatial autocorrelation and set φk = 0, but the most common approach is to use a CAR model such as that given by ([\ref=equation_localCAR]) with the piecewise constant intercept term removed (so that φk  =  θk). This approach has been adopted by [\cite=maheswaran2005] and [\cite=lee2009], and has been shown by [\cite=reich2006] to have the potential for the collinearity problems discussed above. Therefore recently [\cite=hughes2013] proposed representing [formula] with a set of basis functions that are orthogonal to the covariates and are spatially smooth, using the Eigenvectors from the matrix product [formula], where [formula] is the residual projection matrix from fitting a normal linear model to the data. However, this model cannot capture localised spatial structure, and an alternative approach is localised CAR smoothing, with examples including [\cite=lu2007], [\cite=lee2013] and [\cite=lee2014]. This approach treats the elements of the neighbourhood matrix [formula] corresponding to adjacent areal units as random quantities to be estimated in the model, rather than fixed at one. Thus if wki = 1 the corresponding random effects are partially autocorrelated inducing smoothness between them (see ([\ref=equation_partialcorrelation])), while if wki = 0 they are conditionally independent and no such smoothing is induced. [\cite=lee2013] propose an iterative algorithm for estimation, in which [formula] is updated deterministically based on the joint posterior distribution of the remaining model parameters.

Level 3 - The pollution-health relationship [formula]

The modelled pollution concentrations are spatially misaligned with the disease data, as the former are available at a 1 kilometre square resolution while the latter are population summaries for LUA that are irregular in shape and larger than a 1 kilometre square. Therefore, areal unit k has qk concentrations [formula], and hence there is variation in the pollution concentrations within an areal unit for which only a single disease count exists. Furthermore, the population may be unevenly distributed within each areal unit, and the proportions of the population in each of the qk grid squares within areal unit k are denoted by [formula], where [formula]. The standard model for relating air pollution to health in the existing literature has the functional form

[formula]

where [formula] is the average pollution concentration in areal unit k and can be estimated from the observed data as

[formula]

the population weighted average concentration within areal unit k. However, [\cite=wakefield2001] and [\cite=wakefield2006] have shown it is inappropriate to average the pollution concentrations via ([\ref=equation_ecological]) and ([\ref=equation_popweighted]), as this ignores the spatial variation in the concentrations within an areal unit. Specifically, let Yki for [formula], denote the unknown number of disease cases from the pki proportion of the population in areal unit k that experienced pollution concentration wki. Then an appropriate model for the unobserved Yki would be Yki  ~  (EkpkiRki), where [formula] and [formula] are measured and unmeasured covariates that have the same effect across all qk sub-populations within areal unit k. Then as the observed disease data are [formula], we have that [formula] where [formula], which simplifies to:

[formula]

This means that [formula] in the general model ([\ref=equation_likelihood]), which is similar to equation (3.3) in [\cite=wakefield2006]. In the above equation [formula] is the sample population weighted moment generating function for the random variable Wk representing the distribution of pollution concentrations within the kth local authority, that is [formula]. Thus, comparing ([\ref=equation_ecological]) to ([\ref=equation_aggregate]) shows that within area variation in concentrations may cause bias in estimating α as [formula], where [formula].

In this paper we use the sample representation ([\ref=equation_aggregate]) of the moment generating function when estimating the health effects of pollution, but the magnitude of the potential bias can in part be predicted depending on both the distribution of the within-area variation of concentrations assumed for Wk and the relationship between its mean and variance. For example, assume that population density is constant (pki = 1 / qk) and that Wk  ~  (μk,σ2k), then the term [formula] in ([\ref=equation_aggregate]) can be replaced by the moment generating function of Wk, which is exp (μkα  +  0.5α2σ2k). If the variance of Wk increases with the mean in a linear fashion, as is approximately the case with the data presented in Section 2, then σ2k = a + bμk where b > 0. Then comparing the multipliers of μk in ([\ref=equation_ecological]) and exp (μkα  +  0.5α2σ2k) (with σ2k = a + bμk) shows that α̃  =  α  +  0.5bα2. Thus there will be no bias under this setting if the mean and variance are independent (b = 0), while for small α the bias should be small due to the α2 in the bias term 0.5bα2.

Simulation study

This section presents two simulation studies, which respectively assess the impact that different types of residual spatial confounding and within-area variation in the pollution concentrations have on health effects estimation. In the first study the localised smoothing model ([\ref=equation_localCAR]) proposed here is compared against the alternative approaches to dealing with spatial confounding discussed in the last paragraph of Section 3.2, while in the second study the aggregate model ([\ref=equation_aggregate]) is compared against the naive ecological model ([\ref=equation_ecological]).

Study 1 - Spatial confounding

Data generation and study design

Simulated data are generated for the n = 323 LUA comprising mainland England, which is the study region for the motivating study described in Section 2. Disease counts are generated from a Poisson(EkRk) model, where the expected counts Ek are generated from a uniform distribution on the range

[formula]

Results

Five hundred data sets are generated under each of the 8 scenarios described above, and the percentage bias and percentage root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated regression parameter for air pollution are computed as [formula] and [formula] respectively, where i is the estimate for the ith simulated data set from each model. Also computed are the coverage probabilities of the 95% uncertainty intervals for the estimated air pollution effect, and all the results are displayed in Table [\ref=table_simulation1]. None of the models display any systematic bias for any of the scenarios, with biases below 1% in nearly all cases. Scenario A corresponds to no spatial confounding (the residual surface [formula] is independent in space), and all models perform similarly with less than 7% RMSE and coverages close to 95%. The only exception to this is for Model-HH when the spatial confounding standard deviation is 0.1, whose coverage is less than 85%. This relatively poor coverage for Model-HH is consistently observed for many of the remaining scenarios (especially when the spatial confounding standard deviation is 0.1), and suggests that it is not an appropriate model to use in this context.

Scenarios B and C correspond to increasing spatial confounding, and all models exhibit dramatic rises in RMSE and falls in coverage with the larger spatial confounding standard deviation of 0.1. Model-CAR, Model-Local and Model-LM perform the best in this regard and have similar results, in terms of both RMSE and coverage. Surprisingly Model-HH, which is designed to overcome this spatial confounding, does not outperform the other models that are prone to suffer from this confounding. When the standard deviation of [formula] drops to 0.01 the results are similar to those under scenario A, because the level of spatial confounding is very small and hardly affects the fixed effects estimates. Finally, under the localised spatial confounding scenario D Model-Local performs best followed by Model-LM in terms of RMSE, and have lower values than the remaining models by up to 10 times. This is because they are the only models that allow for a non-constant level of spatial smoothing across the study region, and are specifically designed to allow for localised smoothness. However, Model-Local performs worse in terms of coverage than the globally smooth CAR model (Model-CAR) when SD[formula]=0.1, which is due to an underestimation of the random effects variance caused by the piecewise intercept component λZk modelling a proportion of the variation in the data. In contrast, the random effects in Model-CAR are modelling both the jumps and the smooth variation, and hence have a larger estimated variance.

Study 2 results - Within-area variation in pollution

Data generation and study design

Simulated data for this study are generated using the same approach to that taken in the previous study, except that the pollution concentrations are assumed to vary within each LUA. The number of concentrations observed for each LUA is the same as in the real data, and we examine the impact that this variation has on the estimated health effects under a number of different scenarios. Specifically we vary the size of the estimated health effects and the type of within-area variation in pollution, as the discussion in Section 3 suggests that both will affect the results. The pollution-health relationships considered here have relative risks of 1.05 and 1.5 for a 2μgm- 3 increase in concentrations, as the former is similar to that seen in the England data analysed in Section 5 while the latter is chosen to be overly large. Both the absolute level of within-area variation and its relationship with the mean pollution level are varied in this study, with the former having standard deviations of 1 and 10 while the mean and variance of the pollution concentrations are assumed to be either unrelated or positively linearly related. In all cases the within area variation in concentrations is generated from a Gaussian distribution. In all scenarios we compare the aggregate model ([\ref=equation_aggregate]) proposed here with the naive ecological model ([\ref=equation_ecological]) commonly used in these studies, and both are completed by ([\ref=equation_likelihood]) and ([\ref=equation_localCAR]).

Results

Five hundred data sets are generated under each of the 8 scenarios described above, and the results presented in Table [\ref=table_simulation2] include the percentage bias, percentage RMSE and coverage probabilities for the estimated pollution-health relationships. The top panel of the table shows the results for a realistic relative risk of 1.05 for a 2μgm- 3 increase in pollution, for different levels of within-area variation in the pollution concentrations. The table shows that neither the ecological model nor the aggregate model exhibit any systematic bias regardless of the level of within-area variation in the pollution concentrations, which is because the bias term 0.5bα2 (based on the Gaussian and linearity assumptions, see Section 3.3) in the naive ecological model is small as the true value of α = 0.0244. The RMSE values and coverage probabilities for both models are similar, with the latter being close to their nominal 95% levels. These results thus suggest that while the ecological model is inappropriate mathematically, the small effect sizes seen in air pollution and health studies render its bias negligible in practice in this context. Conversely, for the larger effect size of a relative risk of 1.5 for a 2μgm- 3 increase in pollution (α = 0.203), the ecological model shows large bias and RMSE and low coverage if the within area variation in the pollution concentrations increases with the mean in a linear fashion. This result conforms to our theoretical expectations discussed in Section 3.3, while the aggregate model does not suffer from these problems. We note that the larger bias and RMSE observed when SD=1 than when SD=10 for the ecological model is at first surprising. However, as the SD increases so does the average size of the component [formula], leading to larger counts Y and hence the estimation accuracy improves. Finally, as expected, if the within-area variation in the pollution concentrations is independent of the mean pollution level, then the ecological model is once more unaffected.

Results from the England study

Modelling

All models compared in the simulation studies were applied to the England data described in Section 2, which include the full aggregate model comprising ([\ref=equation_likelihood]), ([\ref=equation_localCAR]) and ([\ref=equation_aggregate]) (Model-Local-Agg) proposed here (with G = 5), and the naive ecological model comprising ([\ref=equation_likelihood]), ([\ref=equation_localCAR]) and ([\ref=equation_ecological]) (Model-Local, also with G = 5) that ignores within-area variation in the pollution concentrations. These models allow a comparison of the effect of within-area variation in the pollution concentrations on health effects estimation for real data, and we also assess the impact of appropriately modelling residual spatial autocorrelation in the disease counts. This is achieved by comparing the above models to two commonly used in the literature, namely a simple generalised linear model (Model-GLM) and the extension including a set of spatially autocorrelated random effects with a globally smooth conditional autoregressive prior (Model-CAR, model ([\ref=equation_localCAR]) with φk  =  θk). Additionally, we also compare our results to the recent models of [\cite=hughes2013] (Model-HH) for orthogonal autocorrelation and [\cite=lee2013] (Model-LM) for localised autocorrelation.

The covariates included in each model are one of the three pollutants considered here (NO2, PM2.5, PM10) and the proxy measures of socio-economic deprivation, the latter including the percentage of the working age population in receipt of Job Seekers Allowance and the natural log of the median property price in each LUA. A single pollutant was included in each model due to the positive pairwise correlations between pollutants, which ranged between 0.79 and 0.94 at the LUA level. Such single pollutant analyses are the most common approach in the existing literature, with examples being [\cite=lee2009] and [\cite=haining2010]. Total population counts were available for the 8546 Wards in England, which allows the pollution concentrations within each LUA to be population weighted. The models based on a single mean concentration in each LUA used the population weighted mean given by ([\ref=equation_popweighted]), while the aggregate model ([\ref=equation_aggregate]) uses the populations to weight the risks. Inference for all the Bayesian models (that is not Model-GLM) was based on 120,000 McMC samples, which were generated from 6 parallel Markov chains, and convergence was visually checked by examining trace plots of sample parameters including the pollution-health relationship. The main study results are presented in the next subsection, while the following subsection presents some additional sensitivity analyses.

Main results

The estimated relationships between each pollutant and respiratory hospital admissions from each model are displayed in the top panel of Table [\ref=results1], and are presented as relative risks for a realistic increase in pollution concentrations. These increases are 5μgm- 3 for NO2 and 1μgm- 3 for PM2.5 and PM10, because NO2 has larger values and hence larger variation across England. Overall, the table shows evidence of substantial relationships between air pollution and respiratory disease risk, as 17 of the 18 estimated relative risks have 95% uncertainty intervals that do not include the null risk of one. The most definitive effects are observed for NO2 and PM2.5, while weaker effects are observed for PM10.

The table also shows clear evidence that the model used to allow for residual spatial autocorrelation can have a large impact on health effects estimation, with relative risks for NO2 ranging between a 8.5% and a 9.9% increase in disease risk for a 5μgm- 3 increase in concentrations. The results for PM2.5 and PM10 are even more striking, with estimated risks ranging between a 3.3% and a 6.5% increase for PM2.5 and between 0.9% and 3.3% for PM10. The exploratory analysis presented in Section 2 suggests that the residuals after allowing for the known covariates are locally and not globally spatially smooth (see the bottom right panel of Figure [\ref=data1]), and a comparison between Model-CAR and Model-Local suggests that wrongly fitting a globally smooth CAR model has resulted in substantial overestimation of the pollution-health effects in this study. Finally, a comparison of Model-Local and Model-Local-Agg shows that ignoring within-area variation in the pollution concentrations has no effect on the results, which was suggested by the simulation study as the estimated effect sizes ([formula]) are relatively small. NO2 shows the strongest mean-variance relationships within a Local Authority (highest correlation coefficients in Section 2), and even for this pollutant the bias term, assuming linearity and normality (see Section 3.3), 0.5bα2 is just 0.000122.

Sensitivity analyses

We then undertook a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of changing the model assumptions of Model-Local-Agg, and the results are displayed in the bottom panel of Table [\ref=results1]. This analysis included: (i) changing the maximum number of risk classes G from 5 to 3; (ii) changing the hyperparameters (a,b) of the inverse-gamma distribution for τ2 from (a = 0.001,b = 0.001) to (a = 0.1,b = 0.1) and (a = 0.5,b = 0.0005); and (iii) removing the population weighting in ([\ref=equation_aggregate]) to give equal weight to all pollution concentrations. The table shows that changing G and (a,b) had almost no impact on the results, as the estimated relative risks for all pollutants remained almost identical. Removing the population weighting also had little effect, although for NO2 the estimated risk dropped by 0.6% from 1.087 to 1.081.

Discussion

This paper is the first to propose an integrated modelling framework for estimating the long-term effects of air pollution on human health that accounts for localised spatial autocorrelation in the disease data and the inherent spatial misalignment between the exposure and the response. The model proposed here will be widely applicable to geographical association studies beyond the air pollution arena, and is available for other researchers to use via the R package CARBayes located at http://www.R-project.org/. This paper also provides an in-depth simulation study into the impact of spatial autocorrelation and spatial misalignment on fixed effects estimation, and presents a new study into the long-term effects of air pollution in England in 2010.

One of the main findings of this paper is that inappropriate control for residual (i.e. after the effects of known covariates have been removed) spatial autocorrelation in the disease data can lead to incorrect fixed effects estimation. This problem encompasses both point estimation and uncertainty quantification, and the first simulation study presented here shows some interesting results. Firstly, if, as is the case with the respiratory admissions data presented here, the residual spatial autocorrelation is not globally smooth, then wrongly assuming it is leads to substantially poorer estimation of covariate effects (in terms of RMSE) compared with using a localised smoothing model. Differences in fixed effects estimates were also seen empirically in the real data in Section 5, although one is of course unable to say which estimate is 'correct' in this case. The other main finding from the simulation study is that as expected the greater the level of confounding between the fixed effects and the unmeasured spatial structure, the poorer all models do in terms of fixed effects estimation. This poor performance again encompasses point estimation and uncertainty quantification. However, what is surprising is that the commonly used CAR model, which has been subject to recent criticisms by [\cite=reich2006] and others, does no worse than other more sophisticated models, and in fact outperforms the orthogonal smoothing model proposed by [\cite=hughes2013].

The other main finding of this paper is that for air pollution and health studies, where effect sizes are typically small, ignoring the within-area variation in the exposure caused by the spatial misalignment of the data does not lead to systematic bias. This result is illustrated in the second simulation study presented in Section 4, and is corroborated by the real data results presented in Section 5. The magnitude of any such bias depends on a number of factors, including the effect size being estimated, the distributional shape of the within-area variation in the exposure, and the relationship between the mean and higher order moments of the within-area exposure distribution. Here we only considered a Gaussian distribution for the exposures which is completely characterised by its first two moments and is amenable to analytic study, but if the distribution is skewed then alternatives such as a log-normal distribution may be appropriate instead. However, in general within-area variation in an exposure should not be averaged away by computing a mean, as bias can result if the above conditions are right as shown in the simulation study in Section 4.

The spatial air pollution and disease data used in this study are routinely available for multiple consecutive time periods, and in future work we wish to extend the model proposed here to the spatio-temporal domain. Furthermore, the modelled concentrations used here have complete spatial coverage but are modelled estimates rather than measured concentrations, and as such are prone to biases and uncertainties. However no information on these are available, and thus we plan to develop a two-stage disease model, where the first stage provides better estimates of pollution by fusing the modelled concentrations with observed monitor data using techniques similar to [\cite=berrocal2009].
