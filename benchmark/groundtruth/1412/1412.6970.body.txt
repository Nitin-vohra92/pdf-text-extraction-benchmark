Conneted sum of representations of knot groups

Introduction

For any oriented knots K1 and K2, the connected sum K1  #  K2 is well-defined and has many natural properties. For example, any knot can be uniquely decomposed into prime knots. Also, the simplicial volumes vol(K1), vol(K2) and vol(K1  #  K2) of K1, K2 and K1  #  K2, respectively, satisfy vol(K1  #  K2) = vol(K1) + vol(K2). Furthermore, for the Alexander polynomials ΔK1, ΔK2 and ΔK1  #  K2 of K1, K2 and K1  #  K2, respectively, we have ΔK1  #  K2  =  ΔK1  ·  ΔK2.

On the other hand, many important invariants are defined for a boundary-parabolic representation [formula] and its lift [formula] of the knot group π1(K), where the knot group is the fundamental group of the knot complement [formula] and the boundary-parabolic means any meridian loop of the boundary-torus maps to a parabolic element in [formula] under ρ. For example, the complex volume vol(ρ) + i  cs(ρ) and the twisted Alexander polynomial [formula] are some of the important invariants.

For two boundary-parabolic representations [formula] and [formula], we will define the connected sum of ρ1 and ρ2 in Section [\ref=sec2]. Then this definition satisfies the unique factorization property; for any oriented knot [formula] and any boundary-parabolic representation [formula], there exist unique boundary-parabolic representations satisfying [formula] up to conjugate. (If two same knots Kj and Kk appear in K, then the indices of ρj and ρk can be exchanged.)

Using this definition, we will show the following additivity of complex volumes

[formula]

in Section [\ref=sec3]. The author believes ([\ref=add]) was already known to some experts because the knot complement [formula] is obtained by gluing [formula] and [formula] along [formula], a torus minus two points. However, the proof in Section [\ref=sec3] will be combinatorial and very simple. Furthermore, while proving ([\ref=add]), we will show the solutions of the hyperbolicity equations I1 and I2, which correspond to the five-term triangulations of [formula] and [formula], respectively, are determined by the solution of I, which corresponds to the triangulation of [formula]. (See Lemma [\ref=lem3].) This is not a usual situation because, in general, if we glue two manifolds, then the set of the hyperbolicity equations changes, and even small change on the equations induces radical change on the solutions. Therefore, the solution of the glued manifold usually cannot detect the solutions of the original two manifolds. However, it works for our case in Section [\ref=sec3] because we will use combinatorial method.

In Section [\ref=sec4], we will show the twisted Alexander polynomial [formula] is the product of [formula] and [formula] with normalization. Finally, Section [\ref=sec5] will discuss an example [formula] and its lift [formula].

Although we restrict our attention to boundary-parabolic representations for simplicity, under certain condition, all results in Section [\ref=sec2] and [\ref=sec4] are still true for general representations. It will be discussed briefly later.

Note that all representations in this article are defined up to conjugate. We follow the definition of the complex volume of a representation ρ in [\cite=Zickert09] and that of the twisted Alexander polynomial in Section 2 of [\cite=Morifuji08].

Definition and the unique factorization

Writinger presentation and arc-coloring

For a fixed oriented knot diagram D of a knot K, let [formula] be the arcs of D. These arcs can be regarded as the meridian loops of the boundary-torus, which is expressed by small arrows in Figure [\ref=pic01]. Then Wirtinger presentation gives a presentation of the knot group

[formula]

where the relations [formula] are defined in Figure [\ref=pic02]. (We can remove one relation in [formula] because it can be obtained by all the others.)

Let P be the set of parabolic elements in [formula]. For a boundary-parabolic representation [formula], put ak  =  ρ(αk)∈P and call ak the arc-color of αk (induced by ρ.) Note that, due to the Wirtinger presentation, the arc-coloring determines the representation ρ uniquely (up to conjugate.) Therefore, from now on, we express the representation ρ by using the arc-coloring of a diagram D.

For a,b∈P, we define the operation *   by

[formula]

Then the arc-colors of a crossing satisfy the relation in Figure [\ref=pic03]. Furthermore, the operation * b:a  ↦  a * b is bijective and satisfies

[formula]

for any a,b,c∈P, which implies (P, * ) is a quandle. (See [\cite=Kabaya14] or [\cite=Cho14a] for details.) We define the inverse operation *  - 1 by

[formula]

One trivial, but important fact is that the arc-coloring uniquely changes under the Reidemeister moves. (This is trivial because arc-coloring is uniquely determined by the representation ρ. Another way to see this fact is to consider the relationship between the Reidemeister moves and the axioms of quandle. See Figure [\ref=pic04].)

The connected sum ρ1  #  ρ2 is well-defined up to conjugate.

At first, note that the well-definedness of K1  #  K2 (up to isotopy) is already proved in standard textbooks.

Let a∈P be the coincided arc-color in the definition. For another arc-color b∈P of D2, there exists unique c∈P such that b * c = a. We will show the arc-coloring of the right-hand side of Figure [\ref=pic06] is conjugate with that of Figure [\ref=pic05]. (In Figure [\ref=pic06], D2 * c means the arc-coloring of D2 obtained by acting * c to all arc-colors.)

To show the coincidence, we need the observation on the changes of arc-colors in Figure [\ref=pic07]. The observation shows that the arc-colors outside D or D * x does not change by moving D or D * x across the crossing. Also note that the arc-colors of the two open arcs of D or D * x are always the same.

Moving the diagram D1 of the right-hand side of Figure [\ref=pic06] (or the left-hand side of Figure [\ref=pic08]) inside D2 * c, we obtain the middle picture of Figure [\ref=pic08]. (The changed arc-color of D1 is determined by the arc-color a * c of the two arcs.) By acting *  - 1c to all arc-colors, we obtain the right-hand side of Figure [\ref=pic05], and the coincidence of the arc-colors is proved.

On the other hand, the arc-colorings changed by applying Reidemeister moves to the diagrams D1 and D2 are uniquely determined. (See Figure [\ref=pic04].) Therefore, changing diagrams does not have any impact on the definition of ρ1  #  ρ2.

Choose a diagram D1  #  D2 of K1  #  K2 as in Figure [\ref=pic09](a). Then the arc-colors a,b∈P should satisfy a = b because the corresponding meridian loops are homotopic. Hence we can define ρ1 and ρ2 using the arc-colorings in Figure [\ref=pic09](b).

To show the uniqueness, assume ρ1'  #  ρ2' = ρ  =  ρ1  #  ρ2 up to conjugate. Then ρ1'  #  ρ2' also induces an arc-coloring of D1  #  D2, which should be conjugate with the arc-coloring induced by ρ. Therefore, ρ1' = ρ1 and ρ2' = ρ2 up to conjugate.

The general case of [formula] in Section [\ref=sec1] can be proved by Proposition [\ref=pro1] and the induction on g.

Remark that all discussions in this section can be easily generalized to any representation [formula]. One obstruction is that, for ρ1 and ρ2, ρ1  #  ρ2 is defined only when ρ1(α) is conjugate with ρ2(β) for some meridian loops α∈π1(K1) and β∈π1(K2). Also, generalization to links is possible if we specify which components are connected by the connected sum.

Complex volume of ρ

To calculate the complex volume of ρ1  #  ρ2 explicitly, we briefly review the shadow-coloring of [\cite=Cho14a] and the main result of [\cite=Cho14c].

We identify [formula] with P by

[formula]

Then the operation *   defined in ([\ref=operation]) is given by

[formula]

where the operation on the right-hand side is the usual matrix multiplication. The inverse operation *  - 1 is given by

[formula]

The Hopf map [formula] is defined by

[formula]

For the given arc-coloring of the diagram D with arc-colors [formula], we assign region-colors [formula] to regions of D satisfying the rule in Figure [\ref=pic10]. Note that, if an arc-coloring is fixed, then a choice of one region-color determines all the other region-colors.

Consider the arc-coloring induced by the boundary-parabolic representation [formula]. Then, for any triple (ak,s,s * ak) of an arc-color ak and its surrounding region-colors s,s * ak as in Figure [\ref=pic10], there exists a region-coloring satisfying

See Proof of Lemma 2.4 in [\cite=Cho14a].

The arc-coloring induced by ρ together with the region-coloring satisfying Lemma [\ref=lem] is called the shadow-coloring induced by ρ. We choose p∈P so that

[formula]

From now on, we fix the representatives of shadow-colors in [formula], not in P. Note that this may cause inconsistency of some signs of arc-colors under the operation *  . (In other words, for arc-colors aj,ak,al∈P with aj = ak * al, we allow [formula]. As discussed in [\cite=Cho14a], this inconsistency does not make any problem.) For [formula] and [formula] in [formula], we define the determinant det (a,b) by

For the knot diagram D, we assign variables [formula] to the regions with region-colors [formula], respectively, and define a potential function of a crossing j as in Figure [\ref=fig01], where [formula] is the dilogarithm function.

Then the potential function of D is defined by

[formula]

and we modify it to

Also, from the potential function [formula], we define a set of equations Then, from Proposition 1.1 of [\cite=Cho13c], I becomes the set of hyperbolicity equations of the five-term triangulation of [formula]. Here, hyperbolicity equations are the equations that determine the complete hyperbolic structure of the triangulation, which consist of gluing equations of edges and completeness condition. According to Yoshida's construction in Section 4.5 of [\cite=Tillmann13], a solution [formula] of I determines the boundary-parabolic representation up to conjugate.

For any boundary-parabolic representation [formula] and any knot diagram D of K, there exists the solution [formula] of I satisfying [formula] up to conjugate. Furthermore,

[formula]

The value vol(ρ) + i  cs(ρ) is called the complex volume of ρ.

The explicit formula of [formula] is very simple. For a region of D with region-color sk satisfying Lemma [\ref=lem] and region-variable wk, the value w(0)k of the region-variable is defined by

[formula]

For a boundary-parabolic representation [formula], we have

[formula]

For the connected sum K1  #  K2, consider a diagram D1  #  D2 and its shadow-coloring induced by ρ1  #  ρ2. (Remark that the shadow-coloring satisfies Lemma [\ref=lem].) By rearranging the indices, we assume [formula] and [formula] are the region-colors of D1 and D2, respectively, and sl is the region-color assigned to the unbounded region of D1  #  D2. (See Figure [\ref=pic12](a).)

Let [formula] and [formula] be the potential functions of the diagrams D1 and D2 in Figures [\ref=pic12](b) and (c), respectively. Then

[formula]

holds trivially.

For the solution [formula] of I defined by ([\ref=main]), let [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] and [formula] are solutions of [formula] and [formula], respectively. Furthermore, up to conjugate, and

[formula]

for j = 1,2.

Note that the arc-colorings of D1 and D2 induce the representations ρ1 and ρ2, respectively. Both of the region-colorings [formula] and [formula] of D1 and D2 in Figures [\ref=pic12](b) and (c), respectively, satisfy Lemma [\ref=lem]. Therefore, by applying Theorem [\ref=thm2] to Figures [\ref=pic12](b) and (c), we obtain the results of this lemma.

The relation ([\ref=addvol]) is directly obtained by ([\ref=W1]), ([\ref=volk]) and

[formula]

which complete the proof of Corollary [\ref=cor1].

Twisted Alexander polynomial of [formula]

To calculate (Wada's) twisted Alexander polynomial, we briefly summarize the calculation method in Section 2 of [\cite=Morifuji08].

At first, we lift the boundary-parabolic representation [formula] to [formula] by assuming all arc-colors have trace two. As a matter of fact, this assumption was already reflected in the right-hand side of ([\ref=lift]). Under this lifting, we can trivially obtain

[formula]

Therefore, we will use [formula] instead of [formula] from now on.

Consider the Wirtinger presentation of π1(K) in ([\ref=Wpre]). Let

[formula]

be the abelianization homomorphism given by [formula]. We define the tensor product of [formula] and γ by

[formula]

for x∈π1(K).

From the maps [formula] and γ, we obtain natural ring homomorphisms [formula] and [formula], where [formula] is the group ring of π1(K) and [formula] is the matrix algebra consisting of 2  ×  2 matrices over [formula]. Combining them, we obtain a ring homomorphism

[formula]

Let [formula] be the free group and [formula] be the natural surjective homomorphism. Define [formula] by

[formula]

Consider the (n - 1)  ×  n matrix [formula] whose (k,j)-component is the 2  ×  2 matrix

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the Fox calculus. We call [formula] the Alexander matrix associated to [formula]. We denote by [formula] the (n - 1)  ×  (n - 1) matrix obtained from [formula] by removing the jth column for any [formula]. Then the twisted Alexander polynomial of K associated to [formula] is defined by

[formula]

and it is well-defined up to tp ([formula]).

If we concentrate on a boundary-parabolic representation ρ and its lift [formula], then det Φ(1 - αj) in ([\ref=def_tA]) is always (1 - t)2 independent of the choice of j by the following calculation: after putting [formula] for certain invertible matrix P,

[formula]

(Even when we consider a non-boundary-parabolic representation, the value of det Φ(1 - αj) in ([\ref=def_tA]) is still independent of j because all arc-colors of the knot diagram are conjugate each other.)

Now we apply this calculation method to the case of K1  #  K2 associated to [formula]. For Figure [\ref=pic13](a), consider the Wirtinger presentation of π1(K1) and π1(K2) by

[formula]

and

[formula]

respectively. (In Figure [\ref=pic13], D1 and D2 are the diagrams of K1 and K2, respectively.)

In the above Wirtinger presentation of π1(K1) and π1(K2), we can present π1(K1  #  K2) by

[formula]

In Figure [\ref=pic13](b), the meridian loop corresponding to αl is homotopic to that of αl'. Therefore, after writing down the Wirtinger presentation of π1(K1  #  K2) and substituting αl' to αl in all the relations, the resulting presentation is

[formula]

From the fact that αl is homotopic to αl', two relations in ([\ref=rels]) are redundant, one from D1 and another from D2. After removing rl and rl', we complete the proof.

For the boundary-parabolic representations ρ1, ρ2 and their lifts [formula], [formula], the twisted Alexander polynomials satisfy

[formula]

Consider the Wirtinger presentations of π1(K1), π1(K2) and π1(K1  #  K2) above. Let M1 be the (l - 1)  ×  (l - 1) matrix whose (k,j) component is

[formula]

and M2 be the (n - l)  ×  (n - l) matrix whose (k,j) component is

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Remark that the natural generalization of the Alexander polynomial ΔK(t) is to define the twisted Alexander polynomial [formula], using different normalization from ([\ref=def_tA]), by Then the product formula ([\ref=cor_pro]) changes to

[formula]

which is a natural generalization of ΔK1  #  K2  =  ΔK1  ·  ΔK2.

Note that, for non-boundary-parabolic representations of oriented knots, Corollary [\ref=cor5] still holds with slight modification. The term (1 - t)2 in ([\ref=cor_pro]) should be changed to det Φ(1 - αj), where αj is the arc connecting two diagrams. However, as shown before, choosing any arc αk instead of the connecting arc αj gives the same equation det Φ(1 - αk) =  det Φ(1 - αj).

Example

For the trefoil knot 31 in the left-hand side and the figure-eight knot 41 in the right-hand side of Figure [\ref=pic14], we put the boundary-parabolic representation [formula] determined by the arc-colors

[formula]

where [formula] is a solution of x2 + x + 1 = 0. (We consider each arc-color ak is assigned to the arc αk.) Let ρ  =  ρ1  #  ρ2 for [formula] with j = 1,2, and [formula], [formula], [formula] be their lifts to [formula]. If we put [formula], then all region-colors are uniquely determined by

[formula]

Note that this region-coloring satisfies Lemma [\ref=lem]. If we put

[formula]

then it satisfies ([\ref=p]).

Let [formula] and [formula] be the potential functions of 31 and 41 from Figure [\ref=pic14], respectively. Then

[formula]

[formula]

and the potential function [formula] of 31  #  41 from Figure [\ref=pic14] is

[formula]

Let

[formula]

and define [formula] using the formula ([\ref=main]) as follows:

[formula]

We put [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula], [formula] and [formula] are solutions of I1, I2 and I, respectively. Furthermore, numerical calculation shows

[formula]

and

[formula]

which confirms the additivity of the complex volume in Corollary [\ref=cor1].

To calculate the twisted Alexander polynomials, we put the Wirtinger presentations of 31, 41 and 31  #  41 from Figure [\ref=pic14] by

[formula]

respectively. (If we use Lemma [\ref=lem_conn], the fundamental group π1(31  #  41) can be expressed simply by

[formula]

This presentation shows ([\ref=cor_pro]) trivially, so we are using the Wirtinger presentation of π1(31  #  41) instead.) The Alexander matrices associated to [formula], [formula] and [formula] obtained by the above Wirtinger presentations are

[formula]

[formula]

and [formula]

[formula]

respectively. The corresponding twisted Alexander polynomials obtained by ([\ref=def_tA]) are

[formula]

respectively. Therefore, we obtain

[formula]

which confirms Corollary [\ref=cor5].
