Non-Markovianity hinders Quantum Darwinism

Introduction- Quantum Darwinism is a fascinating theory that explains the emergence of a classical objective reality in terms of proliferation of information about certain states of a quantum system into the environment [\cite=zurekNAT] [\cite=brandao]. We live in a quantum Universe, the behaviour of all microscopic constituents being described by the laws of quantum physics. There is overwhelming evidence that this incredibly successful theory applies at all scales. Why then the macroscopic objects populating our everyday reality are only found in a much smaller subset of states, consistent with classical laws?

The emergence of the classical objective world from the quantum one has been debated and investigated since over a century [\cite=Exploring]. A significant advance in our understanding of the quantum measurement problem was achieved through the theory of environment induced decoherence [\cite=deco1], showing how continuous monitoring by the environment destroys fragile quantum information and allows only certain classical states to survive [\cite=deco2]. Quantum Darwinism takes a further step promoting the role of the environment from a passive sink of coherence to the active carrier of information about the system. Indeed, as Zurek observes [\cite=zurekNAT], generally we do not measure quantum systems directly, rather we infer their properties by the observation of parts of the environment. The question addressed by quantum Darwinism is how certain states of the system produce multiple redundant imprints in uncorrelated fractions of the environment. Such fractions can then be measured by many independent observers that will detect the same property of the system, without perturbing it. This illustrates the emergence of an objective classical reality from the quantum probabilistic world. A recent breakthrough in the field [\cite=brandao] has shown that spreading of the classical information about a pointer observable into the environment is a generic feature of quantum mechanics. Furthermore it has been recently shown that for all models of pure decoherence [\cite=zurekCHER] this spreading leads to agreement of an objective classical reality among different observers. The same has been shown to be true for the photonic environment [\cite=zurekPHOTON] [\cite=korbicz], and in general for a two level system under a controlled unitary evolution for the bath [\cite=horodecki]. Experimental evidence for its workings in a quantum dot scenario has been given in [\cite=dots].

The main result of this Letter is the discovery of a strong correlation between the non-Markovian character of the open quantum system dynamics, indicated by the presence of information flowback [\cite=nonMarkov], and the inhibition of redundancy and hence objectivity. In the non-Markovian dynamics setting [\cite=nonMarkov] [\cite=nonMarkov2] [\cite=resource], indeed, measurements by the observers would inevitably subtract part of the information present in the environment that could feedback into the system, hence perturbing the system's subsequent state.

Model- We illustrate this effect by looking at a paradigmatic model, the quantum Brownian oscillator. This model has been extensively studied in the literature (see, e.g., Ref. [\cite=deco2]) to describe vibrational/bosonic modes dissipating into bosonic reservoirs. Its behavior in terms of quantum Darwinism has been studied in the case of Markovian evolution [\cite=zurekOSC]. The non-Markovian properties of this model for non-Ohmic spectral densities were explored recently in [\cite=vasile], where the relation between resonant/detuned situations and non-Markovianity was pinpointed. We here fill the gap and show that non-Markovian behavior leads to breaking of the process of quantum Darwinism, thus hindering the production of stable records in the bath.

The model consists of a quantum harmonic oscillator of frequency ωS coupled through the bilinear interaction [formula] to a quantum environment of N harmonic oscillators having frequencies ωk  =  ω0 + kΔ, with Δ = (ωR  -  ω0) / N, and xS and xk position operators of system and environment oscillators, respectively. The spectral density is given by

[formula]

which becomes a function in the continuum limit. In typical scenarios an Ohmic (s = 1) frequency dependence J(ω)  ~  ωsf(ω  /  ωR) with f(ω  /  ωR) a frequency cutoff function which decays fast for ω  >  ωR is used, with most variations covering the s  ≠  1 cases. A possible microscopic derivation of such Ohmic dissipation is based on the Rubin model [\cite=Rubin], consisting of a homogeneous linear harmonically coupled chain of equal on-site frequency (ω0) oscillators with coupling strength g, leading to a spectral density [formula] with [formula]. This microscopic model reproduces an Ohmic spectral density for ω0 = 0, while it allows for the study of non-Markovian dynamics when the system is detuned with respect to such bath.

We consider the case in which the system oscillator is initially prepared in a momentum-squeezed state with squeezing parameter r and the environment is in the vacuum state. Because the system and bath couple through position, this is going to be the classically 'recorded' observable of the system, meaning that the initial position spread will be redundantly stored in fragments of the environment. In this sense we expect, if perfect quantum Darwinism occurs, the initial state of the system [formula], with 2σ2  =   exp (2r), to be perfectly broadcasted [\cite=brandao] [\cite=korbicz] into the environment [formula] as independent, perfectly distinguishable (〈ψi(x)|ψi(x')〉  ~  δx,x'), branches which are conditional on each initial position. It is interesting to note that, using the state analysis in [\cite=zurekOSC], this ideal situation can be shown to match a 'measure and prepare' map [\cite=brandao] for system+fraction and furthermore that such branching state can be written in 'spectrum broadcast' form [\cite=korbicz]

[formula]

with ρin(x) = |ψin(x)〉〈ψin(x)|, ρin(x)ρin(x') = 〈ψin(x)|ψin(x')〉  |ψin(x)〉〈ψin(x')| = 0 for x  ≠  x', where the fraction is composed by oscillators [formula]. In fact [\cite=zurekOSC] showed that 〈ψin(x)|ψin(x')〉  =   exp [ -  din(t)(x  -  x')2], where din(t) is a decohering factor highlighting the strength with which fraction in of the bath is able to decohere the system. This means that perfect Darwinism is reached when such factor is big enough. Intuitively, if this ideal situation is achieved, each fragment of the environment can perfectly distinguish the different classical position records of the system, and just by interrogating a fraction (any fraction, of any size) we can gain the information on the label x.

Our main goal is to discuss the connection between non-Markovianity and the dynamical onset of objectification. We will therefore use and compare the non-Markovianity measure for continuous variables systems introduced in Ref. [\cite=NM] on the one hand, and the mutual information between system and fractions of the environment [\cite=zurekOSC] on the other hand.

We detect and quantify the presence of memory effects in terms of information flow back as indicated by the non-monotonic behaviour of fidelity between pairs of states F(ρ1,ρ2). Fidelity monotonically increases under the action of completely positive and trace preserving maps, indicating a decrease in state distinguishability and hence a loss of information on the system due to the action of the environment. A temporary decrease of fidelity for certain time intervals therefore signals a partial increase of information on the system, i.e., information flow back. The corresponding measure of non-Markovianity is obtained by optimizing over all pairs of states [\cite=NM]

[formula]

where the integral extends over all time intervals in which the derivative of the fidelity is negative. In practice, we restrict our attention to Gaussian states, and calculate the corresponding Gaussian measure of non-Markovianity.

The open quantum system model here considered has the property that, by varying the frequency of the system oscillator with respect to the spectral distribution, we change the non-Markovian character of the open system dynamics [\cite=vasile].Specifically, higher values of non-Markovianity are obtained close to the edges of the spectral distribution while on resonance non-Markovianity is minimal, as we further illustrate in the following.

Results- In describing quantum Darwinism the key quantity of interest describes correlations between the system and fragments of the environment of size f. These correlations are given by the mutual information

[formula]

with HS and Hf the individual von Neumann entropies of system and environmental fraction, and HS,f the entropy of the combined system. If the initial state is pure the quantity HS is the entropy of the system due to decoherence and it therefore measures all the information about S available from either the system or the environment. The emergence of an objective reality through decoherence is indicated by the existence of a plateau around f = 1 / 2 in the plot of I(S:f) as a function of f. More precisely the values of I(S:f) quickly raise to HS, indicating that already small factions of the environment contain almost all information classically accessible on the system. Redundancy Rδ = 1 / fδ is the number of independent fragments of the environment that supply almost all classical information on the system, i.e. (1 - δ)HS. Large redundancy, or equivalently small values of fδ, show that the state of the system can be found independently by many observers (probing e.g. independent fractions of different sizes), who agree on the outcome, by measuring parts of the environment without disturbing the system. An important point is also the fact that an observer needs not collect information on a huge set of environmental degrees of freedom, impossible in practical terms, in order to get an idea of the state of the system.

We choose randomly fractions of the environment and investigate the dynamical onset of objectification for different values of the system frequency ωS. As an example, we plot in Fig. 1 the behaviour of f5%. The plot clearly shows that quantum Darwinism, indicated by small values of f5% occurs very rapidly for values of the system frequency resonant with the peak of the spectral density while it is strongly inhibited in the off-resonant regime. This result is confirmed by the plots of Fig. 2 where we show the the asymptotic mutual information as a function of f for resonant system frequency (red curve), at the edge of the spectral distribution (green curve) and for off-resonant frequency (blue curve). It is evident that the plateau disappears when the system frequency moves away from the peak of the spectrum.

In order to link this behaviour with memory effects arising from the structural features of the frequency spectrum we calculate the non-Markovianity measure N of Eq. ([\ref=NMMeas]) and compare its behaviour with the behaviour of the fraction f5% when varying ωS. As one can see from Fig. 3, information flow back, and hence N, is maximal at the edge of the spectrum and minimal at the centre. This is consistent with the fact that on resonance the system energy is rapidly dissipated into the environment. As we move towards the edges of the distribution, the system oscillator is more strongly sensitive to the variations in the form of the spectrum and memory effects become dominant. When off-resonance, oscillatory behaviour dominates the dynamics. Small amplitude oscillations are also present in the redundancy (See Fig. 1) and in the dynamics of the mutual information I(S:f). We quantify this non-monotonic behaviour of fδ by introducing its non-monotonicity defined in a similar fashion to N, namely

[formula]

This quantity is plotted in Fig. 3 (green dashed line) and it shows a good qualitative agreement with the behaviour of the non-Markovianity measure N. There are hence three main regimes where we can highlight the connection between non-Markovianity and quantum Darwinism: when in resonance, the system dissipates monotonously into the bath, meaning a Markovian evolution and a constant tendency towards a perfect quantum Darwinism situation where stable redundant records are established in the environmental fractions. Out of resonance we have exactly the opposite situation, practically no dissipation and no bath's information gain about the system (very poor Darwinism). However, near the frequency edges, information and energy flow back and forth from the system, meaning non-monotonic dissipation and non-Markovianity as well as non-monotonic (Nf > 0) creation of records leading to poor Darwinism (in the sense of higher f5%). The very definition of record requires temporal stability, being this the main motivation to introduce the indicator Nf. All these cases can also be understood in terms of the decoherence factor di(t) appearing in the system+fraction state, which has spectrum-broadcast form, that we have discussed before. If the decoherence factor, for all i, grows in time to big values (resonant case), we will have perfectly distinguishable records in each fragment and perfect Darwinism, as in [\cite=zurekOSC]. Out of resonance, di(t) do not grow and records are fuzzy while in the vicinity of band edges, di(t) are oscillating.

Conclusions- We have studied the connection between non-Markovian dynamics, characterised by information flow back, and the emergence of an objective classical reality through the proliferation of classical copies of the system state in the normal modes of the environment. We have shown that, by modifying the properties of the spectral density, and, in particular, by changing the resonance condition between the system oscillator and the reservoir spectral peak, we can inhibit quantum Darwinism by modifying the Markovian character of the dynamical map.

The quantum Darwinism scenario is deeply connected to a well known description of the dynamics of open quantum systems in terms of quantum trajectories. It is well known that Markovian open quantum systems described by master equations of Lindbad-Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan form [\cite=LGKS] can be described by means of a stochastic Schrödinger equation. Quantum trajectories are pure state solutions of such an equation and can be interpreted as evolution of a single quantum system while its environment is continuously monitored. The deterministic evolution of the state vector is interrupted by the occurrence of quantum jumps whose statistics (waiting time distribution) is linked to the decay rates of the master equation. The evolution of the reduced density matrix of the system is obtained as an ensemble average over single trajectories.

A longstanding open problem of open quantum system theory is the existence of a physical interpretation for single quantum trajectories in the non-Markovian regime, i.e. when memory effects due to long-lasting correlations between system and environment occur. While a definitive answer has not yet been given, it is believed that non-Markovian trajectories do not have a measurement scheme interpretation [\cite=Gambetta]. Indeed, contrarily to the Markovian case, measuring the environment would subtract information that may feedback into the system at a later time, as a result of reservoir memory, hence modifying the dynamics of the system. This is clearly illustrated by the non-Markovian quantum jumps unravelling [\cite=NMQJ].

We believe that the very same reasons for which genuine non-Markovian quantum trajectories do not seem to exist prevents observers to measure part of the environment, in order to infer information on the system, without disturbing the system. In other words, because the production of stable and redundant copies of classical information about the system is linked with monotonous dissipation into the bath, any flow of information back into the system can be directly interpreted as diminishing these records, whence the relation between non-Markovian behavior and non-monotonic redundant registers formation.

Besides the fundamental interest, our results give a new perspective on the active debate on whether or not non-Markovianity can generally lead to more efficient quantum technologies. A number of investigations suggest that this might actually be the case in certain specific scenarios [\cite=resource] but a formal answer in the framework of abstract resource theory is still missing. Our study supports the conjecture that non-Markovian dynamics might be useful for quantum technologies showing that memory effects push the boundary between the quantum and the classical world, inhibiting the emergence of classicality. In this sense reservoir engineering techniques may open a new and yet unexplored door into the quantum realm.
