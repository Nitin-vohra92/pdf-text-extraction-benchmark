Nucleus Driven Electronic Pulsation

Introduction

The creation of electron-positron pairs through strong fields, which as been predicted theoretically by F. Sauter as early as 1931 [\cite=sauter] but not yet been observed, is nowadays of high interest for both laboratory scientists and astrophysicists [\cite=preparata] [\cite=ipp]. The obstacle to be solved is the creation of a sufficiently strong electric field. In this note we will present an approach to investigate the dynamic response of an ultra-relativistic compressed electron gas subjected to the breathing mode of the underlying nucleus, a system that promises to generate strong electric fields, depending on the mutual dynamics of negative and positive charges. This model can, with slight modification like an adjustment of proton density, be extrapolated to astrophysical scales. In [\cite=ludwig] we presented the stationary solutions of pulsating electron gas in the framework of the Thomas-Fermi model, and we will now recapitulate the main results that are of importance for the present work. In this model the nucleus is modeled as a sphere of homogenous positive charge distribution. The electrons are considered a charged perfect fluid with the equation of state of a Fermi gas at zero temperature.

Spectral Method Formalism

Since we want to treat the regime around nuclear density we can assume the ultra-relativistic limit

[formula]

for the equation of state, where ρ, p, and n are energy density, pressure, and number density respectively of the electron gas. Throughout the text, natural units c = 1, [formula] are used. When we assume the nucleus of proton number Z to have a radius [formula] in units of the pion mass, and provide sufficient external pressure to restrain the electrons to the volume of the nucleus, we obtain the very simple equilibrium configuration

[formula]

The parameter Δ measures the departure of proton density from nuclear densities. Positive and negative charges completely cancel, so there is no electric field in equilibrium. Introducing a time-dependent displacement field ξ(t,r) and treating Euler's and Maxwell's equations to first order, one obtains for stationary modes the second order ordinary differential equation

[formula]

Here α is the fine structure constant, and ω is the frequency of the mode that has to be choosen according to approriate boundary conditions. This leads to

[formula]

where C is an arbitrary factor and j1(z) is the first member of the spherical Bessel functions of first kind. The first member of the spherical Bessel functions of first kind j1(z) allows to construct an orthonormal basis (see Figure [\ref=fig:basisPlot])

[formula]

on the interval

[formula]

Solving the Equation of Motion

According to ([\ref=diffEqn]) and ([\ref=omegaN]) the basis functions fulfil the equation

[formula]

where [formula] is a differential operator in r. Making the ansatz

[formula]

and plugging it into the equation of motion subject to an external force

[formula]

we can expand in the basis (ξn) to obtain the independent equations

[formula]

where

[formula]

If the force is applied just for an instant at t = 0 we can write fn(t) = fnδ(t), and assuming the system initially unperturbed (Tn(t) = 0 for t < 0) the solution to ([\ref=eqnsOM]) is

[formula]

If the force is applied at a frequency Ω starting at t = 0 we can write fn(t) = fnθ(t) sin (Ω  t), and assuming the system initially unperturbed the solution to ([\ref=eqnsOM]) is

[formula]

Using for fn now the coefficients of ([\ref=deltaExpand]) or ([\ref=idExpand]), we can construct various dynamical situtations in the compressed atom.

Conclusions

Using the formalism developed above, it is now possible to investigate the response of the electron gas to the nuclear breathing mode for different system sizes from atoms and giant atoms to neutron stars. The proton density should be determined from beta-equilibrium, while the frequency of the breathing mode has to be inferred from studies of nuclear incompressibility such as [\cite=blaizot] [\cite=wang]. An investigation has to take into account the energy budget of the intitial breathing mode, comparing it to the energy transferred to electron gas and electric field, to determine if dampening of the former occurs first.
