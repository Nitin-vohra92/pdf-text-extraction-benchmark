ABSTRACT

We propose nonlinear Schrödinger equation with gravitational self-interacting term. The separability conditions of Bialynicki-Birula are satisfied in asymptotic sense. Solitonlike solutions were found. truecm

There is an old-established common knowledge that when extending quantummechanical laws to macroscopic bodies one is confronted, among others, with the following problem.

According to classical physics, in the absence of external forces the center of mass of a given macroobject either moves uniformly along a straight line or, in the particular case, rests at a certain point. Unfortunately, the Schrödinger equation of a free particle does not have localized stationary solutions. Wave-packet solutions which are possibly the best representation for the free motion of a macroscopic body are not stationary. On the contrary, the wave-packet corresponding to the c.m. continually widens with the time thus the position of the c.m. becomes more and more uncertain. At the same time, experiences show that a macroscopic object always has a well defined position.

A possible way to walk round this contradiction is to exclude the initial states which develop measurable spread of c.m. of the given macroobject. For instance, if the wave-function of the given body of several grams weight is initially localized in a volume of about 10- 8 cm linear size (or larger) the quantummechanical spreading of its c.m. will be extremely slow. The initial position displays no change even for thousands of years, and the wave-packet of the c.m. is apparently stationary with very good precision.

People often argue that it is meaningless to suppose that a macroscopic body can have more accurate localization than the typical atomic size 10- 8 cm. Nevertheless, this is only a bad guess. Let us accept that the position of a single atom is usually smeared in a volume of atomic size. Then we must conclude that the c.m. position of a group of many atoms will be defined much more accurately than the position of the single atoms.

This reasoning shows that the atomic size 10- 8 cm does not give an absolute limitation for localizing macroobjects. Thus it would be conceivable to suppose a 1 milligram macroscopic object with a wave-packet of 10- 12 cm width. However, this initial width becomes several times larger even in a few minutes. Hence, quantummechanics woud predict nonstationary behaviour for the free motion of a macroobject and this anomaly could, in principle, be detected in certain extreme experiments1.

However, Nature can single out an other possible way for solving the problem of wave-function localization: we cannot exclude the existence of a mechanism which modifies the laws of the quantummechanics for macroscopic objects. A modified Schrödinger equation will then have localized stationary solutions describing the state of macroobjects. Such arguments were put forward in Ref. 2, where nonlinear but local term was added to the Schrödinger equation and solitonlike solutions were found.

In the present work we show that the gravitational interaction possibly could prevent the unbounded quantummechanical spreading of the c.m. position of macroobjects, at least in certain quantumstates. If this interaction is included, it destroys the linearity of quantummechanics3. In the nonrelativistic case, newtonian gravitation can explicitely be built into the Schrödinger equation. We arrive then at a nonlinear integro-differential equation possessing solitonlike solutions, the ones we need to describe the well-localized macroobjects.

A theory, satisfactorily unifying the quantummechanics and the gravitation in every respect, still has not been found. Here we are going to apply the approach of Møller and Rosenfeld4,5:

[formula]

where g is the metrics, Rab is the Ricci-tensor, G stands for the constant of Newton and c denotes the velocity of the light. On the RHS of the Einstein equation we put the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor operator T̂ab in the actual quantum state ψ.

This equation is certainly not correct if the fluctuation of Tab is too large in the quantumstate φ, e.g. when macroscopically different densities of the energy and momentum are superposed6. But, if the given quantumstate ψ can definitely be associated with only one microstate, there can be no a priori objection against Eq. (1). Actually, this equation is to be applied as long as we do not quantize gravity.

Henceforth we shall discuss nonrelativistic systems. Let us consider the Schrödinger equation for a system of N particles having masses m1,m2...,mN:

[formula]

Here, [formula] stands for the space coordinates of the particles, Vrs is the interaction potential and Φ denotes the newtonian gravitational potential given by the nonrelativistic equivalent of the Einstein equation (1):

[formula]

If we solve the Poisson equation (3) explicitely, we can eliminate the potential Φ from Eq. (2). Thus we are led to the following nonlinear integro-differential equation:

[formula]

For one free pointlike object of mass M, Eq. (4) reduces to the following nonlinear Schrödinger equation with non-local self-interacting term:

[formula]

An important feature of Eq. (4) is that it asymptotically satisfies the separability condition of Bialynicki-Birula2: Let ψ(A)(xA,t) and ψ(B)(xB,t) be solutions to Eq. (5) for single particles A and B respectively. If the spatial separation of A and B is large enough to neglect both the potential VAB and the gravitational interaction between A and B, then the wave-function ψAB(xA,xB,t) = ψ(A)(xA,t)  ·  ψ(B)(xB,t) is a solution to the two-particle equation (4) with N = 2.

Let us remind that in Ref.2 only mathematically local nonlinearities were discussed. Our nonlinear term is nonlocal.

We note that in Eqs. (4), (5) the wave-functions must be normalized to the unity. The nonlinear Schrödinger equation (5) preserves this normalization:

[formula]

and the expectation value of the momentum operator p̂ and that of the energy operator Ê are conserved as well:

[formula]

[formula]

Naturally, Eq. (5) is covariant against galilean transformations. It can be shown that if ψ(x,t) solves the Eq. (5) then the function

[formula]

will also be a solution, where r and v are arbitrary constants.

Certain solutions of unit norm can conveniently describe the quantummechanical propagation of a given pointlike macroobject of mass M. We are going to show that the solution of minimal energy is a solitonlike fixed wave-packet with static spatial density. Let us consider the normalized function φ(x) minimizing the energy functional (8):

[formula]

[formula]

One can easily verify that the phase of φ will not depend on the variable x thus we can choose φ(x) to be a real function. The resulting minimum problem is

[formula]

where ε is a Lagrange multiplier.

It can be proved that if φ0(x),ε0 satisfy the minimum condition (12) and also the normalization (11) then the wave-function

[formula]

is a solution to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (5). Indeed, substituting the ansatz (13) into Eq. (5) one arrives at the nonlinear time-independent Schrödinger equation for φ0(x). This latter equation is the same as the variational equation corresponding to the minimum problem (12). Thus, function (13) proves to be the ground-state solution to Eq. (5).

Finally, we have to find the function φ0(x). Let us suppose that φ0(x) is a smooth real function of unit norm,which has a peak with a characteristic width [formula] at the origin and tends to zero outside this region. We can qualitatively evaluate the expression (10) of the energy E, which is now depending on the width [formula]:

[formula]

By minimizing this expression we get the characteristic width a0 of the ground-state wave-function φ0(x):

[formula]

Hence, this value can be taken as the measure of the quantummechanical uncertainty in the position of a free pointlike macroscopic object. The expression (13) is the stationary ground-state wave-function of an object localized at the origin. Applying galilean transformation (9), one can construct the stationary wave-function corresponding to arbitrary uniform rectilinear motion of the object.

In addition to these one-soliton solutions, the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (5), unfortunately, possesses other solutions too. These latter are associated with quantummechanical states which generally cannot occure in the world of macroobjects. We do not know precisely how to exclude these paradoxical solutions from the theory. The most natural idea is to suppose that certain physical mechanism destroys such states.

Let us demonstrate a typically unphysical two-soliton solution. The propagation of the given pointlike macroobject is described by two wave-packets of width about a0. Both of them are normalized to 1 / 2. The two wave-packets are moving around each other as if they were two objects with mass M / 2, gravitationally attracting each other.

Formula (15) yields the width of the wave-packet of a free pointlike macroobject, i.e., the extension of the object is much less than the spread a0 of its position. Now we estimate the value of a0 for a homogeneous spherical object of radius R and mass M, supposing that a0  ≪  R. The only change appears in the interaction term in the functionals (10), (12). The simple newtonian kernel [formula] has to be substituted by the effective interaction potential [formula] of two homogeneous spheres with radius R and mass M:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The characteristic [formula]-dependence of the energy E is the following:

[formula]

The width a(R)0 of the ground-state wave-packet is given by the minimization of E:

[formula]

where a0 is the spread of the pointlike object, see formula (15).

We consider formulae (15) and (18) as the main result of this work. We claim that these expressions define the natural width of the wave-packet of any macroscopic object. A similar problem of the natural uncertainty in the orientation of an extended macroobject can be discussed in this frame, too.

It is interesting to note that, in Ref.1, the same result (15) was obtained from certain principle of the metrical smearing of the space-time. For extended objects, the relation a(R)0  ≈  a1 / 30  ·  R2 / 3 was derived, which is not identical with our result (18). However, if a critical size Rc is defined by the condition a(R)0 = Rc, then Ref.1 and formula (18) yield the same value [formula] cm for objects of normal density. In Ref.2 special considerations are used to estimate the critical size and a value of also about 10- 5 cm was predicted. Both papers1,2 and the present one too, adopt the idea that a breakdown of the superposition principle is foreseen in the macroworld and Rc defines the line of demarcation between micro- and macroobjects.
