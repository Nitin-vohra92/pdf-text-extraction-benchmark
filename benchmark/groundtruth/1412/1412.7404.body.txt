Admissibility and nonuniformly hyperbolic sets

Introduction

Our main objective is to obtain a characterization of two classes of dynamics with nonuniformly hyperbolic behavior in terms of an admissibility property. Namely, we consider the class of exponential dichotomies with respect to a sequence of norms and the class of nonuniformly hyperbolic sets.

In the first part of the paper we consider a nonautonomous dynamics with discrete time obtained from a sequence of linear operators on a Banach space and we characterize the notion of an exponential dichotomy with respect to a sequence of norms. The principal motivation for considering this notion is that includes both the notions of a uniform and of a nonuniform exponential dichotomy as special cases. We refer the reader to the books [\cite=CLb] [\cite=H] [\cite=He] [\cite=SY] for details and further references on the uniform theory. On the other hand, the requirement of uniformity for the asymptotic behavior is often too stringent for the dynamics and it turns out that the notion of a nonuniform exponential dichotomy is much more typical. We refer the reader to [\cite=BP2] for an account of a substantial part of the theory. Most of the work in the literature related to admissibility has been devoted to the study of uniform exponential dichotomies. For some of the most relevant early contributions in the area we refer to the books by Massera and Schäffer [\cite=MS] and by Dalec'ki and Kreın [\cite=DK]. We also refer to [\cite=LV] for some early results in infinite-dimensional spaces. For a detailed list of references, we refer the reader to [\cite=CLb] and for more recent work to Huy [\cite=HH].

We emphasize that we consider the general case of a noninvertible dynamics which means that we assume only the invertibility along the unstable direction. Moreover, we characterize exponential dichotomies with respect to a sequence of norms in terms of the admissibility of a large family of Banach spaces (the particular case of lp spaces was considered in [\cite=BDV]). We note that the approach to establishing exponential bounds along the stable and the unstable directions differs from the standard technique of substituting test sequences (see for example [\cite=H] [\cite=HH]). Moreover, in contrast to the existing approaches, we are able to obtain bounds along the stable and unstable directions in a single step.

In the second part of the paper we obtain an analogous characterization of nonuniformly hyperbolic sets. The notion of a nonuniformly hyperbolic set arises naturally in the context of smooth ergodic theory. Indeed, if f is a C1 diffeomorphism of a finite-dimensional compact manifold preserving a finite measure μ with nonzero Lyapunov exponents, then there exists a nonuniformly hyperbolic set of full μ-measure. We refer the reader to [\cite=BP2] for details. Our work is close in spirit to that of Mather [\cite=M], who obtained a similar characterization of uniformly hyperbolic sets, as well as that of Dragievi and Slijepevi [\cite=DS], where the problem of extending Mather's result to nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamics was first considered. However, there are substantial differences between our approach and that in [\cite=DS], which provides a characterization of ergodic invariant measures with nonzero Lyapunov exponents and not of nonuniformly hyperbolic sets.

Preliminaries

In this section we introduce a few basic notions. Let S be the set of all sequences [formula] of real numbers. We say that a linear subspace B  ⊂  S is a normed sequence space if there exists a norm [formula] such that if [formula] and [formula] for [formula], then [formula] and [formula]. If in addition [formula] is complete, we say that B is a Banach sequence space.

Let B be a Banach sequence space. We say that B is admissible if:

χ{n}∈B and [formula] for [formula], where χA denotes the characteristic function of the set [formula];

for each [formula] and [formula], the sequence [formula] defined by smn = sn + m belongs to B and there exists N > 0 such that [formula] for [formula] and [formula].

We present some examples of Banach sequence spaces.

The set [formula] is a Banach sequence space when equipped with the norm [formula].

For each p∈[null] be a nondecreasing nonconstant left-continuous function. We set [formula] for t  ≥  0. Moreover, for each [formula], let [formula]. Then

[formula]

is a Banach sequence space when equipped with the norm

[formula]

We need the following auxiliary results.

Let B be an admissible Banach sequence space.

If [formula] and [formula] are sequences in S and s1n = s2n for all but finitely many [formula], then [formula] if and only if [formula].

If [formula] in B when n  →    ∞  , then snm  →  sm when n  →    ∞  , for [formula].

For each [formula] and λ∈(0,1), the sequences [formula] and [formula] defined by

[formula]

are in B, and

[formula]

1. Assume that [formula] and let [formula] be the finite set of all integers [formula] such that s1n  ≠  s2n. We define [formula] by vn = 0 if n∉I and vn = s2n - s1n if n∈I. Since B is an admissible Banach sequence space, we have [formula] and thus [formula].

2. We have

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula]. By the definition of a normed sequence space, we obtain

[formula]

for [formula] and the conclusion follows.

3. We define a sequence [formula] by [formula] for [formula]. Clearly, [formula] and [formula]. Moreover,

[formula]

Since B is complete, the series [formula] converges to some sequence [formula]. It follows from the second property that

[formula]

for [formula]. Since [formula] for [formula], we conclude that [formula] and [formula], which yields that the first inequality in [\eqref=bnd] holds. One can show in a similar manner that [formula] and that the second inequality in [\eqref=bnd] holds.

Now let [formula] be a Banach space and let [formula], for [formula], be a sequence of norms on X such that [formula] is equivalent to [formula] for each [formula]. For an admissible space B, let

[formula]

For [formula], we define

[formula]

[formula] is a Banach space.

Let [formula] be a Cauchy sequence in YB. Repeating arguments in the proof of Proposition [\ref=l2], one can show that [formula] is a Cauchy sequence in X for each [formula]. Let

[formula]

and let [formula] for [formula]. Since

[formula]

we conclude that

[formula]

Hence, [formula] is a Cauchy sequence in B. Since B is complete, it follows from property 2 in Proposition [\ref=l2] that [formula] in B when k  →    ∞  , where [formula] for [formula]. In particular, [formula]. One can easily verify that the sequence [formula] converges to 0 in YB, which implies that [formula] converges to [formula] in YB.

Admissibility and exponential dichotomies

In this section we consider the notion of an exponential dichotomy with respect to a sequence of norms and we characterize it in terms of the invertibility of a certain linear operator.

Basic notions

Let X be a Banach space and let L(X) be the set of all bounded linear operators from X to itself. Given a sequence [formula] in B(X), let

[formula]

We say that [formula] admits an exponential dichotomy with respect to the sequence of norms [formula] if:

there exist projections Pm:X  →  X for each [formula] satisfying

[formula]

such that each map [formula] is invertible;

there exist constants D > 0 and 0 < λ < 1 < μ such that for each x∈X and [formula] we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] and

[formula]

for n < m.

More generally, one can consider the notion of an exponential dichotomy for sequences of linear operators between different spaces. Namely, let [formula], for [formula], be pairwise isomorphic Banach spaces. Given a sequence of bounded linear operators Am:Xm  →  Xm + 1, for [formula], one can define [formula] by [\eqref=*AC] and introduce a corresponding notion of an exponential dichotomy, with projections Pm:Xm  →  Xm for [formula]. All the results obtained in this section hold verbatim in this general setting, but we prefer avoiding the cumbersome notation.

Now let B be a Banach sequence space. Our main aim is to characterize the notion of an exponential dichotomy with respect to a sequence of norms in terms of the invertibility of the operator TB:D(TB)  ⊂  YB  →  YB defined by

[formula]

on the domain D(TB) formed by all vectors [formula] such that [formula].

The linear operator TB:D(TB)  ⊂  YB  →  YB is closed.

Let [formula] be a sequence in D(TB) converging to [formula] such that [formula] converges to [formula]. It follows from the definition of YB and property 2 in Proposition [\ref=l2] that

[formula]

for [formula], using the continuity of the linear operator An - 1. Therefore, [formula] and [formula]. This shows that the operator TB is closed.

For [formula] we consider the graph norm

[formula]

Clearly, the operator

[formula]

is bounded and from now on we denote it simply by TB. It follows from Proposition [\ref=propo.1] that [formula] is a Banach space.

Characterization of exponential dichotomies

In this section we characterize the notion of an exponential dichotomy with respect to a sequence of norms in terms of the invertibility of the operator TB.

If the sequence [formula] admits an exponential dichotomy with respect to the sequence of norms [formula], then the operator TB is invertible.

In order to establish the injectivity of the operator TB, assume that [formula] for some [formula]. Then xn = An - 1xn - 1 for [formula]. Let xsn = Pnxn and xun = Qnxn. We have xn = xsn + xun and it follows from [\eqref=*AX] that

[formula]

for [formula]. Moreover, [formula] for m  ≥  0 and hence,

[formula]

where [formula]. Letting m  →    ∞   in the last term yields that xsk = 0 for [formula]. Similarly, [formula] for m  ≥  0 and hence,

[formula]

Therefore, xuk = 0 for [formula] and hence [formula]. This shows that the operator TB is injective.

Now we show that TB is onto. Take [formula]. For each [formula], let

[formula]

and

[formula]

We have

[formula]

It follows from property 3 in Proposition [\ref=l2] that [formula] and [formula] belong to YB. Now let xn = x1n + x2n for [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] and one can easily verify that [formula]. This completes the proof of the theorem.

Now we establish the converse of Theorem [\ref=thm.1].

If the operator TB is bijective, then the sequence [formula] admits an exponential dichotomy with respect to the sequence of norms [formula].

For each [formula], let X(n) be the set of all x∈X with the property that there exists a sequence [formula] such that xn = x and xm = Am - 1xm - 1 for m > n. Moreover, let Z(n) be the set of all x∈X for which there exists [formula] such that zn = x and zm = Am - 1zm - 1 for m  ≤  n. One can easily verify that X(n) and Z(n) are subspaces of X.

For each [formula], we have

[formula]

Given v∈X, we define a sequence [formula] by yn = v and ym = 0 for m  ≠  n. Clearly, [formula]. Hence, there exists [formula] such that [formula], that is,

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since [formula], we obtain

[formula]

Moreover, by [\eqref=a], we have v∈X(n) + Z(n).

Now take [formula] and choose [formula] and [formula] in YB such that xn = zn = v,

[formula]

and

[formula]

We define [formula] by ym = xm for m  ≥  n and ym = zm for m < n. It is easy to verify that [formula] and [formula]. Since TB is invertible, we have [formula] and thus yn = v = 0.

Let Pn:X  →  X(n) and Qn:X  →  Z(n) be the projections associated to the decomposition in [\eqref=DEC].

Property [\eqref=*AX] holds.

It is sufficient to show that

[formula]

for [formula]. Take v∈X(n) and [formula] such that xn = v and

[formula]

Then xn + 1 = Anv∈X(n + 1). Now take v∈Z(n) and choose [formula] such that zn = v and zm = Am - 1zm - 1 for m  ≤  n. We define [formula] by zm' = zm for m  ≠  n + 1 and zn + 1 = Anv. Since [formula] and

[formula]

we conclude that Anv∈Z(n + 1).

The linear operator [formula] is invertible for each [formula].

We first establish the injectivity of the operator. Assume that Anv = 0 for v∈ ker Pn = Z(n) and choose [formula] such that zn = v and

[formula]

Moreover, we define [formula] by ym = 0 for m > n and ym = zm for m  ≤  n. Clearly, [formula] and [formula]. Since TB is invertible, we conclude that [formula] and thus yn = v = 0.

In order to show that the operator is onto, take v∈ ker Pn + 1 = Z(n + 1) and [formula] with zn + 1 = v and zm = Am - 1zm - 1 for m  ≤  n + 1. Clearly, zn∈Z(n) and Anzn = zn + 1. This shows that [formula] is onto.

Now we establish exponential bounds. Take [formula] and v∈X. Moreover, let [formula] and [formula] be as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=L]. For each z  ≥  1, we define a linear operator

[formula]

by

[formula]

We have B(1) = TB and

[formula]

for [formula] and z  ≥  1. In particular, this implies that B(z) is invertible whenever [formula], and

[formula]

Take t = 1 / z for a given [formula] and let [formula] be the unique element such that [formula]. Writing

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

(where [formula]). For each [formula], let [formula] and [formula]. Clearly, [formula]. One can easily verify that [formula] and hence [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

for [formula]. Moreover, it was shown in the proof of Lemma [\ref=L] that Pnv = xn and Qnv =  - An - 1xn - 1. Hence, it follows from [\eqref=a1] and [\eqref=*3] that

[formula]

for m  ≥  n. Similarly, it follows from [\eqref=a1] and [\eqref=*3] that

[formula]

for m < n. By [\eqref=AA] and [\eqref=EF], there exists D > 0 such that [\eqref=eq:1] and [\eqref=eq:2] hold taking λ = t and μ = 1 / t. This completes the proof of the theorem.

Nonuniformly hyperbolic sets

Now we consider an elaboration of the situation considered in Section [\ref=S3]. Namely, we characterize the notion of a nonuniformly hyperbolic set in terms of the invertibility of certain linear operators. More precisely, to each trajectory fn(x) of a nonuniformly hyperbolic set of a diffeomorphism f one can associate a linear operator defined in terms of the sequence of tangent spaces dfn(x)f (see the discussion after Definition [\ref=DEF]). Moreover, each trajectory admits an exponential dichotomy with respect to the same sequence of tangent spaces and so it is natural to use arguments that are an elaboration of those in the former section.

Basic notions

Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold and let f:M  →  M be a C1 diffeomorphism.

An f-invariant measurable set Λ  ⊂  M is said to be nonuniformly hyperbolic if there exist constants 0  <  λ  <  1  <  μ and a df-invariant splitting

[formula]

for x∈Λ such that given ε > 0, there exist measurable functions [formula] such that for each x∈Λ:

for v∈Es(x) and n  ≥  0,

[formula]

for v∈Eu(x) and n  ≥  0,

[formula]

[formula]

for [formula],

[formula]

We note that a nonuniform hyperbolic set gives rise naturally to a parameterized family of exponential dichotomies with respect to a sequence of norms. More precisely, to each trajectory one can associate an exponential dichotomy (see [\cite=BP2]).

Let Λ  ⊂  M be a nonuniformly hyperbolic set. Then for each ε  >  0 such that λeε  <  1  <  μe-  ε there exists a norm [formula] on TΛM such that for each x∈Λ the sequence of linear operators

[formula]

admits an exponential dichotomy with respect to the norms [formula].

Alternatively, Proposition [\ref=prp.6] can be obtained as a consequence of the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm.5] below (the proof introduces a particular norm that is also adapted to our characterization of nonuniformly hyperbolic sets).

Characterization of nonuniformly hyperbolic sets

Given an admissible Banach sequence space B and a norm [formula] on the tangent bundle TΛM, for each x∈Λ we denote by Yx the set of all sequences [formula] with μn∈TxnM, where xn = fn(x), such that [formula]. One can easily verify that Yx is a Banach space with the norm

[formula]

Finally, we define a linear operator Rx by

[formula]

on the domain formed by all [formula] such that [formula].

Let Λ  ⊂  M be a nonuniformly hyperbolic set and let B be an admissible Banach sequence space. Then there exists ε0 > 0 such that for every ε∈(0,ε0) there is a norm [formula] on TΛM and a measurable function [formula] such that for each x∈Λ:

[formula]

[formula]

Rx:Yx  →  Yx is a well defined, bounded and invertible linear operator;

there exists a constant D > 0 (independent of ε and x) such that

[formula]

Since M is compact and f is continuous, there exists A > 0 such that [formula] and [formula] for x∈M. Without loss of generality, one may assume that 1 / A  ≤  λ and μ  ≤  A (since otherwise one can simply increase A). Take ε0 > 0 such that λeε0  <  1  <  μe-  ε0. For each ε∈(0,ε0) we introduce an adapted norm [formula] on TΛM. For v∈Es(x), let

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=1] that

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

for v∈Es(x). Similarly, for v∈Eu(x), let

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=2] that

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

for v∈Eu(x). One can show in a similar manner that

[formula]

For an arbitrary v∈TxM, we define

[formula]

where v = vs + vu with vs∈Es(x) and vu∈Eu(x). It follows from [\eqref=3], [\eqref=B1] and [\eqref=B2] that

[formula]

Hence, [\eqref=G1] holds taking G(x) = (C(x) + 1) / K(x). Moreover, it follows from [\eqref=7] that [\eqref=G2] holds. Finally, it follows from [\eqref=T1] and [\eqref=T2] that

[formula]

for x∈Λ and v∈TxM.

Now let P(x):TxM  →  Es(x) and Q(x):TxM  →  Eu(x) be the projections associated to the decomposition [formula].

There exists a constant Z > 0 (independent of ε and x) such that

[formula]

for x∈Λ and v∈TxM.

For each x∈Λ let

[formula]

Take a vector v∈TxM such that Pv  ≠  0 and Qv  ≠  0, where P = P(x) and Q = Q(x). Then

[formula]

and thus,

[formula]

for v∈TxM. In order to estimate γεx, take vs∈Es(x),vu∈Eu(x) such that [formula]. It follows from [\eqref=T1], [\eqref=T3] and [\eqref=T4] (recall that ε  <  ε0) that

[formula]

and thus,

[formula]

Therefore, [\eqref=BB] holds taking

[formula]

This completes the proof of the lemma.

Now take x∈Λ. It follows from [\eqref=T4] that Rx is a well defined bounded linear operator on Yx. We first show that it is onto. Let [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=AUX], we have [formula] and [formula], where

[formula]

For each [formula], let

[formula]

and

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=bnd], [\eqref=T1], [\eqref=T3] and [\eqref=BB] (since ε  <  ε0) that [formula] and [formula] belong to Yx. Moreover,

[formula]

for [formula]. Therefore, [formula], where ξn  =  ξsn  +  ξun, belongs to Yx and

[formula]

Moreover, one can easily verify that [formula].

Now we show that Rx is injective. Assume that [formula] for some [formula]. Then ξn = dxn - 1f for [formula] and hence, ξsn = dxn - 1fξsn - 1 and ξun = dxn - 1fξun - 1 for [formula]. For each [formula], it follows from [\eqref=T1] that

[formula]

for m  ≥  0. Letting m  →    +    ∞  , since λeε0 < 1 we obtain ξsk = 0. Similarly, ξuk = 0 for [formula] and thus [formula]. This shows that Rx is invertible. In addition, it follows from [\eqref=N] that there exists a constant D > 0 (independent on x and ε) such that [\eqref=BI] holds. This completes the proof of the theorem.

Now we establish the converse of Theorem [\ref=thm.5].

Let Λ  ⊂  M be an f-invariant measurable set and let B be an admissible Banach sequence space. Assume that there exist D > 0 and ε0 > 0 such that for each ε∈(0,ε0) there is a norm [formula] on TΛM and a measurable function [formula] such that for each x∈Λ:

[\eqref=G1] and [\eqref=G2] hold;

Rx:Yx  →  Yx is a well defined bounded invertible linear operator and [\eqref=BI] holds.

Then Λ is a nonuniformly hyperbolic set.

Take x∈Λ and v∈TxM. We define [formula] by μ0 = v and μn = 0 for n  ≠  0. Clearly, [formula]. Now take [formula] such that [formula]. It can be written in the form

[formula]

We will show that v = vs + vu, where vs  =  ξ0 and vu =  - dx- 1fξ- 1 is the hyperbolic splitting. For each z  ≥  1 we define an operator B(z) on Yx by

[formula]

Clearly,

[formula]

for [formula] and z  ≥  1. Therefore, B(z) is invertible whenever 1  ≤  z  <  1 + 1 / D, and

[formula]

Now take λ∈(0,1) (independently on ε) such that λ- 1 < 1 + 1 / D and take [formula] such that [formula]. Writing

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

For each [formula], let [formula] and [formula]. Clearly, [formula]. Moreover, one can easily verify that [formula] and hence [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

for [formula]. Finally, it follows from [\eqref=G1] that

[formula]

for m  ≥  1, where C(x) = 2D'NG(x)λ- 1.

Now let Es(x) and Eu(x) be the sets, respectively, of all vectors vs and vu constructed above. These are df-invariant subspaces of TxM and are uniquely defined (and so independent of ε). Indeed, take v∈TxM and let v = vs + vu with vs∈Es(x) and vu∈Eu(x). We define [formula] by μ0 = dxfv and μn = 0 for n  ≠  0. Clearly, [formula]. Moreover, we define [formula] by ξn = dxfn + 1vs for n  ≥  0 and ξn =  - dxfn + 1vu for n < 0. Then [formula] (this is a consequence of the fact that the sequence [formula] constructed above belongs to Yx). Finally, it is easy to check that [formula]. This implies that

[formula]

is the hyperbolic splitting of dxfv and so the decomposition is df-invariant.

We have

[formula]

and thus,

[formula]

By [\eqref=G1], we obtain

[formula]

where K(x) = 1 / ((2 + 2D)G(x)). It follows readily from [\eqref=G2] that the functions C and K satisfy [\eqref=7] with ε replaced by 2ε. This shows that the set Λ is nonuniformly hyperbolic.
