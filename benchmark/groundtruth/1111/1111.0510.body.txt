Translation-finite sets

Introduction

This note is an elaboration on the beautiful work of Ruppert [\cite=Ru] from 1985. Given a discrete infinite group Γ we define right and left versions of the combinatorial property (of subsets of Γ) of being translation finite. Then, using the ultrafilter representation of the ech-Stone compactification βΓ, we show that the collections of sets with these properties form ideals (Theorem [\ref=Fcal]). This yields a new proof of Ruppert's theorem which asserts that the collection of translation finite sets forms an ideal. We then use these results to obtain some unexpected information about the map π:βΓ  →  ΓWAP, the canonical semigroup homomorphism from βΓ onto ΓWAP, the universal semitopological semigroup compactification of Γ (Theorem [\ref=pi]).

The C*-algebras [formula] and WAP(Γ)

Let Γ be a countable discrete infinite group with unit element e. We briefly review some basic properties of the C*-algebras [formula], of bounded complex-valued functions on Γ, and WAP(Γ), the closed subalgebra comprising the weakly almost periodic functions on Γ. Recall that [formula] is weakly almost periodic if its orbit under translations [formula] is a weakly precompact subset of the Banach space [formula]. We are mostly interested in their Gelfand (or maximal ideal) spaces: βΓ, the ech-Stone compactification of Γ, and ΓWAP, the universal WAP-compactification of Γ, respectively.

The compactification βΓ can be viewed as the collection of ultrafilters on Γ, where an element γ∈Γ is presented as the principal ultrafilter [formula]. Then the left translation of an ultrafilter q∈βΓ by γ is the ultrafilter γq  =  {A  ⊂  Γ:γ- 1A∈q} (note that this extends the product on Γ as [formula]) . These translations define a left action of Γ on βΓ and the resulting pointed dynamical system (βΓ,e,Γ) is the universal ambit (or point transitive pointed system). That is, for any point transitive pointed Γ dynamical system (Y,y0,Γ) there is a unique homomorphism of pointed dynamical systems π:(βΓ,e,Γ)  →  (Y,y0,Γ).

This Γ action on βΓ can be extended to a multiplication on βΓ as follows: for p,q∈βΓ

[formula]

This multiplication has the property that for each fixed q∈βΓ the map Rq:βΓ  →  βΓ, defined by p  ↦  pq  =  mR(p,p) is continuous. Thus this product makes βΓ a right topological semigroup. It can be shown that this right topological semigroup can be identified with the enveloping semigroup E(βΓ,Γ) of the dynamical system (βΓ,Γ).

One can also define a left product on βΓ by

[formula]

This extension of the product on Γ to a product on βΓ makes βΓ a left topological semigroup, i.e. one in which the maps Lq:βΓ  →  βΓ, defined by p  ↦  q  ·  p  =  mL(p,p), are continuous.

The remainder space of Γ is the compact space [formula]. Clearly X is a subsemigroup of βΓ with respect to both right and left multiplications. We let [formula] and [formula]. We also set [formula].

As the algebra C0(Γ), comprising the functions on Γ which vanish at infinity, is contained in the algebra WAP(Γ) we deduce that WAP(Γ) distinguishes points in Γ and that consequently the natural compactification map of Γ into ΓWAP is an isomorphism. We will therefore consider Γ as a dense discrete subset of both βΓ and ΓWAP.

A dynamical system (X,Γ) is called weakly almost periodic (WAP) if for every F∈C(X), its orbit [formula] forms a weakly precompact subset of the Banach space C(X). A theorem of Ellis and Nerurkar which is based on well known results of Grothendiek asserts that a system (X,Γ) is WAP iff its enveloping semigroup E(X) consists of continuous maps, iff E(X) is a semitopological semigroup (that is, one in which both right and left multiplications are continuous). It then follows that the dynamical system ΓWAP is the universal WAP point transitive dynamical system. Moreover, ΓWAP is isomorphic to its own enveloping semigroup and is therefore also the maximal semitopological semigroup compactification of Γ.

Let π:βΓ  →  ΓWAP denote the canonical homomorphism of the corresponding dynamical systems. With our identifications of Γ as a subset of both βΓ and ΓWAP we have π(γ)  =  γ for every γ∈Γ. We set [formula]. As a direct consequence of the discussion above we see that for every p,q∈βΓ we have π(pq)  =  π(p)π(q) and π(p  ·  q) = π(p)π(q). Consequently [formula]. A result of our analysis shows that the restricted map

[formula]

is a homeomorphism (Theorem [\ref=pi] below). This extends results of Ruppert and Hindman and Strauss (see [\cite=H-S]).

Translation-finite sets

Recall the following theorems of Ruppert (Theorem 7 and Proposition 13 in [\cite=Ru]).

ITF is an ideal and ITF  =  IW  =  IIW.

Every infinite subset of Γ contains an infinite TF subset.

Ruppert's main tools in analyzing the TF property were the universal WAP compactification of Γ and Grothendieck's double limit characterization of WAP functions. Our approach is through the ech-Stone compactification of Γ and the combinatorial definition of the product of ultrafilters.

FR  =  FRTF, in particular FRTF is a filter.

FL  =  FLTF, in particular FLTF is a filter.

[formula], hence

We prove the two inclusions of claim (1) below. The claim (2) then holds by symmetry and claim (3) is obtained by taking the appropriate intersections and applying Ruppert's theorem.

Side 1:   We first show that FRTF  ⊂  FR. Consider B∈FRTF and suppose A  ⊂  Γ has the property that there are p,q∈X with A∈pq; i.e. Ap←:  =  {γ∈Γ:Aγ- 1∈p}∈q. Then |Ap←| =   ∞   and by assumption there is a finite subset F  ⊂  Ap← such that [formula] is cofinite in Γ. As p is an ultrafilter this implies that for some δ∈F we have Bδ- 1∈p. Now, as both Bδ- 1 and Aδ- 1 are in p so is [formula]. In particular we conclude that [formula]. This discussion shows that for any two ultrafilters p,q in X their product pq is in [formula]; hence [formula], i.e. B∈FR.

Side 2:   Next we show that FR  ⊂  FRTF. Suppose then that A  ⊂  Γ is not in FRTF; i.e. there is an infinite D  ⊂  Γ such that for every finite F  ⊂  D we have [formula]. Clearly then the collection of sets of the form (AF- 1)c, with F  ⊂  D finite, is a filter, say L, on Γ. Choose some ultrafilter p  ⊃  L. Now choose an ultrafilter q with D∈q. We will show that [formula], whence [formula], as required.

Assuming A∈pq we have Ap←  =  {γ∈Γ:Aγ- 1∈p}∈q. However if δ∈D then (Aδ- 1)c∈L, hence (Aδ- 1)c∈p, hence [formula], hence Dc  ⊃  Ap←∈q, hence Dc∈q. This is a contradiction and we conclude that indeed [formula].

We have [formula], hence [formula].

The restriction of π to the open dense subset [formula] of X is a homeomorphism from [formula] onto [formula].

Step 1:   Given [formula], where y∈Y and U is an open subset of ΓWAP, let V be an open subset of ΓWAP such that [formula]. The set ṽ  =  π- 1(V) is an open subset of βΓ such that [formula] (since π is a homomorphism of semigroups we have π(X2)  =  π(X·  2)  =  Y2, for both right and left semigroup structures on βΓ). Let [formula], then [formula] and therefore A∈I. By Theorem [\ref=Fcal].3 we have A∈ITF and then, by Theorem [\ref=Ru], A∈IW. We conclude that [formula] is a clopen neighborhood of y which is contained in U. Thus we have shown that the collection of sets of the form [formula] with A∈ITF, is a basis for the topology on [formula].

Step 2:   If A is any set in ITF then again by Theorem [\ref=Ru], A∈IW  =  IIW and we conclude that [formula] is a clopen subset of ΓWAP which is homeomorphic to βA. By the universality of βA it follows that [formula] is a homeomorphism.

Step 3:   Again if A is any set in ITF then, by Theorem [\ref=Ru], A∈IW and we conclude that [formula] is a clopen subset of ΓWAP. We claim that [formula]. Clearly [formula]. Conversely, if p∈βΓ with [formula], let p  =   lim γν for a net γν∈Γ. Then y  =  π(p)  =   lim π(γν)  =   lim γnu and, as by assumption the set [formula] is a clopen subset of ΓWAP, it follows that eventually γν∈A. Thus we have [formula] as claimed.

Step 4:   By Proposition 13 of [\cite=Ru] (Theorem [\ref=Ru].2), every infinite subset B  ⊂  Γ contains an infinite subset A  ⊂  B with A∈ITF. In view of step 1 above this shows that the set [formula] is a dense open subset of Y.

Step 5:   Summing up we have shown that (i) the collection of clopen sets [formula] forms a basis for the topology on [formula], (ii) for each A∈ITF, [formula] and moreover (iii) [formula] is a homeomorphism. These facts together with the fact that [formula] is a dense open subset of Y prove the assertions of Theorem [\ref=pi].

Divisible properties, IP and D sets

In [\cite=Gl-80] a collection P of subsets of Γ is called a divisible property if

[formula] and Γ∈P,

P is hereditary upward (i.e. A∈P and B  ⊃  A imply B∈P and

if A∈P is a union [formula] then at least one of the sets A1 and A2 is in P.

A collection P is divisible iff the collection [formula] is an ideal iff the dual collection [formula] is a filter. When F is a filter of subsets of Γ the compact (nonempty) subset [formula] is called the kernel of F. Conversely, any compact subset K  ⊂  βΓ defines a filter

[formula]

The correspondence F  ↔  K is one to one and we note that

[formula]

are the corresponding ideal and divisible properties respectively.

Expressed explicitly the divisible property which corresponds to the ideal of RTF-sets is the following one: a subset A  ⊂  Γ is not right translation finite, an NRTF-set, if there exists an infinite subset D  ⊂  Γ such that for every finite subset F  ⊂  D the corresponding intersection [formula] is infinite. NLTF-sets are defined similarly and a set A is NTF if if there exists an infinite subset D  ⊂  Γ such that for every finite subset F  ⊂  D at least one of the two corresponding intersections [formula] and [formula] is infinite. In this terminology Theorem [\ref=Fcal] is stated as follows:

The properties NRTF, NLTF and NTF are divisible with corresponding kernels ZR,ZL and Z respectively.

Note however that the ideal IW is not what we call in [\cite=Gl-80] the collection of interpolation sets of the algebra WAP(Γ), as in Definition [\ref=defn].6 we postulate that A∈IW when it is a WAP(Γ) interpolation set which additionally satisfies the requirement that [formula]. In [\cite=Gl-80] (Corollary 5.3.2) we have shown that the collection J of WAP-interpolation sets has the property that if [formula] then at least one of the sets Ai is not in J. Let ΓWAPdis denote the universal totally disconnected semitopological compactification of Γ. It is obtained as the quotient ΓWAP  /    ~   of ΓWAP by the equivalence relation: [formula] x and y lie in the same connected component. Let WAPdis(Γ) denote the corresponding C*-algebra.

(a) Is the collection of WAP(Γ)-interpolation sets an ideal ?

(b) Is the collection of WAPdis(Γ)-interpolation sets an ideal ?

For simplicity let us assume next that Γ is abelian. We will denote the group operation by +   but keep the notation (p,q)  ↦  pq for the semigroup operation on βΓ. Recall that a subset A of Γ is a D-set if there is an infinite sequence {γi}∞i = 1  ⊂  Γ such that for every i  ≠  j at least one of the elements γi  -  γj or γj  -  γi is in A. The subset A is called an IP-set if there is an infinite sequence {γi}∞i = 1  ⊂  Γ such that for every finite sequence [formula] the element [formula] is in A. It is well known that Hindman's theorem is equivalent to the fact that the collection of IP-sets is a divisible property with the set [formula] (the closure of the set of idempotents in X) as its kernel. Obviously K  ⊂  Z. It is easy to see that every IP-set is also a D-set.

The filter which corresponds to the IP-sets is the collection of IP*-sets:

[formula]

Similarly the filter which corresponds to the D-sets is the collection of D*-sets:

[formula]

The fact that the collection of D-sets is a divisible property is equivalent to Ramsey's theorem and in [\cite=Gl-80] we have identified the kernel of this divisible property as the following closed subset L  ⊂  X. Define the set V  ⊂  X as follows: p∈X is in V iff there is an element q∈X and a net [formula] in Γ such that [formula] and [formula]. Now put [formula].

It is easy to see that V  ⊂  X2, whence L  ⊂  Z. Thus the identifications of the kernels K and L, together with Theorem [\ref=Fcal], immediately lead to the following corollary.

Every CTF-set (i.e. the complement of a TF-set) is a D*-set and a fortiori an IP*-set.
