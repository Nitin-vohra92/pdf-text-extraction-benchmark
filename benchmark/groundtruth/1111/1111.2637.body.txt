Introduction

Self-dual codes and unimodular lattices are studied from several viewpoints (see [\cite=SPLAG] for an extensive bibliography). Many relationships between self-dual codes and unimodular lattices are known and therefore these two objects have similar properties. In this paper, binary singly even self-dual codes of length 40 and odd unimodular lattices in dimension 40 are studied. Both binary self-dual codes and unimodular lattices are divided into two classes, namely, doubly even self-dual codes and singly even self-dual codes, and even unimodular lattices and odd unimodular lattices. In addition, a binary doubly even self-dual code of length n (as well as an even unimodular lattice in dimension n) exists if and only if [formula]. This motivates to study binary self-dual codes of length n and unimodular lattices in dimension n when [formula].

It is a fundamental problem to classify self-dual codes and unimodular lattices. Much work has been done towards classifying binary self-dual codes and unimodular lattices for modest lengths and dimensions (see [\cite=SPLAG]). A big progress has been realized recently in the classification of binary self-dual codes with different parameters. Five papers related to this subject were presented in 2010 and 2011. All self-dual codes of length 36 were classified in [\cite=HM36]. The extremal codes among them, namely the self-dual

[formula]

codes was done by three research groups independently. In [\cite=AGKSS38] the authors proved that there are exactly 2744 extremal self-dual

[formula]

codes, and 1730 s-extremal self-dual

[formula]

codes. In [\cite=BB38], an efficient algorithm for classification of binary self-dual codes was described and then applied to length 38. In this way all self-dual codes of length 38 were classified.

The main aim of this paper is to give a classification of binary extremal singly even self-dual codes of length 40. Some part of the classification is done by considering a relationship with binary doubly even self-dual codes of the same length. In addition, the classification is completed using the algorithm presented in [\cite=BB38]. A partial classification of extremal odd unimodular lattices in dimension 40 is also established from the classification of binary extremal doubly even self-dual codes of length 40.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=Sec:Def], we give definitions and some basic properties of the self-dual codes and unimodular lattices used in this paper. In Section [\ref=Sec:C], we study the binary extremal singly even self-dual codes of length 40. The number of vectors of weight 4 in the shadow of a binary extremal singly even self-dual code of length 40 is at most 10 [\cite=C-S]. We demonstrate that there are 19 inequivalent binary extremal singly even self-dual codes with shadows having 10 vectors of weight 4. This classification is done by considering a relationship with binary doubly even self-dual codes of length 40 such that the supports of all codewords of weight 4 are T-decompositions. We mention a relationship between such binary doubly even self-dual codes and even self-dual additive [formula]-codes. By a method similar to the above, our classification is also extended to all cases that shadows have minimum weight 4. The classification of binary extremal (singly even) self-dual codes of length 40 is also completed by an approach which does not depend on the weight enumerators. As a consequence, we have a classification of binary extremal singly even self-dual codes with shadows of minimum weight 8, which is the remaining case. More precisely, combined with the above classification, we demonstrate that there are 10200655 inequivalent binary extremal singly even self-dual codes of length 40. In Section [\ref=Sec:L], for extremal odd unimodular lattices, we consider a situation which is similar to that for binary extremal singly even self-dual codes with ten vectors of weight 4 in the shadows, given in Section [\ref=Sec:C]. The number of vectors of norm 2 in the shadow of an extremal odd unimodular lattice in dimension 40 is at most 80. It is shown that there are 16470 non-isomorphic extremal odd unimodular lattices in dimension 40 with shadows having 80 vectors of norm 2. This classification is done by considering a relationship with binary extremal doubly even self-dual codes of length 40. Finally, in Section [\ref=Sec:Z4], we investigate theta series for which there is an extremal odd unimodular lattice in dimension 40. The existence of a number of extremal self-dual [formula]-codes of length 40 is also given.

Generator matrices of all inequivalent binary extremal singly even self-dual codes of length 40 can be obtained electronically from [\cite=Data]. Most of the computer calculations in this paper were done by Magma [\cite=Magma]. In Section [\ref=Subsection:0], the package Self-dual-bin by the second author is also used, where it's main algorithm implemented in the program Gen-self-dual-bin is described in [\cite=BB38].

Preliminaries

Binary self-dual codes

Let [formula] denote the finite field of order q, where q is a prime power. Any subset of [formula] is called an [formula]-code of length n. An [formula]-code is linear if it is a linear subspace of [formula]. An [formula]-code is called binary and all codes in this paper mean binary linear codes unless otherwise noted.

A code is called doubly even if all codewords have weight [formula]. The dual code [formula] of a code C of length n is defined as [formula] where x  ·  y is the standard inner product. A code C is called self-dual if [formula]. A self-dual code which is not doubly even is called singly even. A doubly even self-dual code of length n exists if and only if [formula], while a singly even self-dual code of length n exists if and only if n is even.

Let C be a singly even self-dual code and let C0 denote the subcode of codewords having weight [formula]. Then C0 is a subcode of codimension 1. The shadow S of C is defined to be [formula]. There are cosets C1,C2,C3 of C0 such that [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. Shadows were introduced by Conway and Sloane [\cite=C-S], in order to provide restrictions on the weight enumerators of singly even self-dual codes. Two self-dual codes C and C' of length n are said to be neighbors if [formula]. Since every self-dual code C of length n contains the all-one vector [formula], C has 2n / 2 - 1 - 1 subcodes D of codimension 1 containing [formula]. Since [formula], there are two self-dual codes rather than C lying between [formula] and D. When C is doubly even, one of them is doubly even and the other is singly even for each subcode D. If C is a singly even self-dual code of length divisible by 8, then C has two doubly even self-dual neighbors, namely [formula] and [formula] (see [\cite=BP]).

The minimum weight d(C) of a self-dual code C of length n is bounded by d(C)  ≤  4⌊n / 24⌋ + 4 unless [formula] when d(C)  ≤  4⌊n / 24⌋ + 6 [\cite=Rains]. We say that a self-dual code meeting the upper bound is extremal.

Two codes C and C' are equivalent, denoted [formula], if one can be obtained from the other by permuting the coordinates. An automorphism of C is a permutation of the coordinates which preserves the code. The set consisting of all automorphisms of C forms a group called the automorphism group of this code and it is denoted by [formula]. The number of the codes equivalent to C is [formula], where n is the length of C. If we consider the action of the symmetric group Sn on the set Ωn of all self-dual codes of length n, then two codes from this set are equivalent if they belong to the same orbit. This action induces an equivalence relation in Ωn and the equivalence classes are the orbits with respect to the action of Sn. To classify the self-dual codes of length n means to find exactly one representative of each equivalence class.

Self-dual additive [formula]-codes and [formula]-codes

In Section [\ref=Subsec:C], we also consider additive [formula]-codes where [formula]. Such a code is a k-dimensional [formula]-subspace of [formula] and so has 2k codewords. An additive [formula]-code is even if all its codewords have even Hamming weights. Two additive [formula]-codes C1 and C2 are equivalent if there is a map from Sn3  ×  Sn sending C1 onto C2, where Sn acts on the set of the n coordinates and S3 permutes the elements 1,ω,ω2 of the field. The automorphism group of C, denoted by [formula], consists of all elements of Sn3  ×  Sn which preserve the code.

An additive [formula]-code C is called self-dual if C  =  C*, where the dual code C* of C is defined as [formula] under

[formula]

Even self-dual additive [formula]-codes exist only in even lengths. The minimum Hamming weight d(C) of an even self-dual additive [formula]-code C of length n is bounded by d(C)  ≤  2⌊n / 6⌋ + 2 [\cite=RS-Handbook]. We say that an even self-dual additive [formula]-code meeting the upper bound is extremal.

The last family of self-dual codes which we consider is the set of self-dual [formula]-codes, where [formula] denotes the ring of integers modulo 4. The self-dual [formula]-codes are connected with unimodular lattices of a special form [\cite=Z4-BSBM]. A [formula]-code C of length n is a [formula]-submodule of [formula]. A [formula]-code C is self-dual if [formula], where the dual code [formula] of C is defined as [formula] for all y∈C} under the standard inner product x  ·  y. We say that two [formula]-codes are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by permuting the coordinates and (if necessary) changing the signs of certain coordinates.

The Euclidean weight of a codeword [formula] of C is n1(x) + 4n2(x) + n3(x), where nα(x) denotes the number of components i with xi  =  α (α = 1,2,3). A [formula]-code C is Type II if C is self-dual and the Euclidean weights of all codewords of C are divisible by 8 [\cite=Z4-BSBM] [\cite=Z4-HSG]. A self-dual code which is not Type II is called Type I. A Type II [formula]-code of length n exists if and only if [formula], while a Type I [formula]-code exists for every length. The minimum Euclidean weight dE(C) of a Type II [formula]-code C of length n is bounded by dE(C)  ≤  8⌊n / 24⌋ + 8 [\cite=Z4-BSBM]. It was also shown in [\cite=RS-bound] that the minimum Euclidean weight dE(C) of a Type I code C of length n is bounded by dE(C)  ≤  8⌊n / 24⌋ + 8 if [formula], and dE(C)  ≤  8⌊n / 24⌋ + 12 if [formula]. A self-dual [formula]-code meeting the upper bound is called extremal.

Unimodular lattices

A (Euclidean) lattice [formula] in dimension n is integral if L  ⊂  L*, where the dual lattice L* of L is defined as [formula] under the standard inner product (x,y). An integral lattice is called even if the norm (x,x) of every vector x is even. A lattice L = L* is called unimodular. A unimodular lattice which is not even is called odd. An even unimodular lattice in dimension n exists if and only if [formula], while an odd unimodular lattice exists for every dimension. Two lattices L and L' are isomorphic, denoted [formula], if there exists an orthogonal matrix A with L'  =  L  ·  A.

Rains and Sloane [\cite=RS-bound] showed that the minimum norm min (L) of a unimodular lattice L in dimension n is bounded by min (L)  ≤  2⌊n / 24⌋ + 2 unless n = 23 when min (L)  ≤  3. We say that a unimodular lattice meeting the upper bound is extremal.

Let L be an odd unimodular lattice and let L0 denote its sublattice of vectors of even norms. Then L0 is a sublattice of L of index 2 [\cite=CS-odd]. The shadow S of L is defined to be [formula]. There are cosets L1,L2,L3 of L0 such that [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. Shadows for odd unimodular lattices appeared in [\cite=CS-odd] and also in [\cite=SPLAG], in order to provide restrictions on the theta series of odd unimodular lattices. Two lattices L and L' are neighbors if both lattices contain a sublattice of index 2 in common. If L is an odd unimodular lattice in dimension divisible by 8, then L has two even unimodular neighbors of L, namely, [formula] and [formula].

Singly even self-dual codes of length 40

In this section, we give a classification of extremal singly even self-dual codes of length 40. For the case that the shadows have minimum weight 4, the classification was done in two different ways.

Weight enumerators

An extremal singly even self-dual code C of length 40 and its shadow S have the following weight enumerators:

[formula]

respectively, where β is an integer with 0  ≤  β  ≤  10 [\cite=C-S]. It was shown in [\cite=HM06] that an extremal singly even self-dual code with weight enumerator W40,C,β exists if and only if [formula].

Let C be an extremal singly even self-dual code of length 40 with weight enumerator W40,C,β. Then one of [formula] and [formula] is an extremal doubly even self-dual code of length 40 and the remaining one is a doubly even self-dual code of length 40 containing β codewords of weight 4.

The codes [formula] and [formula] are doubly even self-dual codes [\cite=BP]. The lemma is trivial in the cases β = 0 and β = 1. Suppose that S has at least two vectors of weight 4. Let x,y be vectors of weight 4 in S with x  ≠  y. If x∈C1 and y∈C3, then x + y∈C2 and [formula], which contradicts the minimum weight of C2. Hence, we may assume without loss of generality that all vectors of weight 4 in S are contained in C1. Then [formula] is extremal and [formula] has β codewords of weight 4.

Weight enumerator W40,C,10, T-decompositions and self-dual additive [formula]-codes

Let C be a code of length [formula]. A partition [formula] of [formula] is called a T-decomposition of C if the following conditions hold:

[formula]

for [formula] and i  ≠  j [\cite=KKM]. In particular, when all Ti are the supports of codewords of C, we say that C contains the T-decomposition.

In this subsection, we assume that C is an extremal singly even self-dual code of length 40 with weight enumerator W40,C,10. By Lemma [\ref=lem:1], we may suppose without loss of generality that all ten vectors of weight 4 in S are contained in C1.

There is a T-decomposition for the self-dual codes C, [formula] and [formula]. In particular, [formula] contains a T-decomposition.

Denote by S4 the set of the ten vectors of weight 4 in the shadow S of C. The supports of any two vectors of S4 are disjoint. Thus, [formula] is a T-decomposition for the codes C, [formula] and [formula].

By Lemmas [\ref=lem:1] and [\ref=lem:S4], every extremal singly even self-dual code C of length 40 with weight enumerator W40,C,10 is constructed as a neighbor of a doubly even self-dual code D satisfying the following condition

[formula]

It follows that [formula] and [formula]. Since [formula], there are two doubly even self-dual codes lying between [formula] and C0. In this case, one doubly even self-dual code [formula] has minimum weight 4 and the other one [formula] has minimum weight 8. Hence, C0 is contained in a unique doubly even self-dual code satisfying the condition ([\ref=eq:Tdec]). This means that extremal singly even self-dual codes, constructed in this way from inequivalent doubly even self-dual codes satisfying ([\ref=eq:Tdec]), are inequivalent. In other words, it is sufficient to check equivalences only for the subcodes D with dim (D) = 19, d(D) = 8 and [formula] contained in each doubly even self-dual code satisfying ([\ref=eq:Tdec]), in order to complete our classification. This observation substantially reduces the necessary calculations for equivalence tests in our classification.

We start the classification of extremal singly even self-dual codes with weight enumerator W40,C,10 by investigating the doubly even

[formula]

Weight enumerators W40,C,β ([formula])

In this subsection, we continue a classification of extremal singly even self-dual codes by modifying the classification method for the case β = 10, which was given in the previous subsection.

Suppose that 1  ≤  β  ≤  8. Let C be a doubly even self-dual code of length 40. By modifying the definition of T-decompositions, we consider a collection [formula] satisfying the conditions ([\ref=eq:T2]), ([\ref=eq:T3]) and

[formula]

for i  ≠  j. Denote by NβDE(40) the number of the inequivalent doubly even self-dual codes with A4  =  β and by [formula] the number of those codes among them which satisfy ([\ref=eq:T2]), ([\ref=eq:T3]) and ([\ref=eq:T4]). It is trivial that [formula] for β = 1,2. The numbers NβDE(40) and [formula] for [formula] are obtained in [\cite=BHM40], and the results are listed in Table [\ref=Tab:2].

For [formula], a similar argument to that given in the previous subsection shows that every extremal singly even self-dual code with weight enumerator W40,C,β can be constructed from some doubly even self-dual code with A4  =  β containing [formula], which satisfies the conditions ([\ref=eq:T2]), ([\ref=eq:T3]), ([\ref=eq:T4]). Moreover, the argument for equivalence tests given in the previous subsection is also applied to the cases [formula]. Hence, for these cases, we were able to complete the classification of extremal singly even self-dual codes with weight enumerator W40,C,β. For the case β = 1, the calculations took about 3 months using 6 cores of a PC Intel i7 6 core processor. The numbers NβSE(40) of inequivalent extremal singly even self-dual codes of length 40 with weight enumerators W40,C,β are also listed in Table [\ref=Tab:2] for [formula]. Combined with Proposition [\ref=prop:b10], we have the following:

There are 6602658 inequivalent extremal singly even self-dual codes of length 40 with shadows of minimum weight 4.

In Table [\ref=Tab:AutCR1], we list the numbers [formula] of inequivalent extremal singly even self-dual codes with automorphism groups of order [formula] and covering radii R for [formula].

Another approach and weight enumerator W40,C,0

The classification of extremal self-dual codes of length 40 was also completed by an approach which does not depend on the weight enumerators. As a consequence, we have a classification of extremal singly even self-dual codes with weight enumerator W40,C,0, which is the remaining case. Here we describe how such a classification was done.

From the self-dual codes of length 38 and minimum weights 6 and 8, we complete a classification of the extremal self-dual codes of length 40, using the algorithm presented in [\cite=BB38], noting that a classification of self-dual codes of length 38 was done in [\cite=BB38]. We emphasize that the used algorithm has a better way to deal with equivalence classes and it gives as output exactly one representative of every equivalence class. The constructive part of the algorithm is not different from the other recursive constructions of self-dual codes, which were listed in [\cite=AGKSS38], but to take only one representative of any equivalence class, we used a completely different manner. Its special feature is that practically there is not equivalence test for the objects. Algorithms of this type are known as isomorph-free generation [\cite=McK].

The algorithm for isomorph-free generation solves two main problems. The first one is to find only inequivalent objects (in our case extremal self-dual codes of length 40) using a basic object B from the previous step (in our case a self-dual code of length 38 and minimum weight 6 or 8). It is easy to solve this by defining an action of the automorphism group [formula] on the set of the objects constructed from B. For this construction, we use the method described in [\cite=HM36].

The second main problem is how to take only the inequivalent objects among already constructed ones (after solving the first problem). This problem and our solution is explained in details in [\cite=BB38]. We give here only the general idea. We use the concept for a canonical labeling map and a canonical representative of an equivalence class. We consider here the action of the symmetric group Sn on the set of all self-dual codes of length n. We fix a so called canonical representative for any equivalence class which is selected on the base of some specific conditions. The canonical representative is intended to make easily a distinction among the equivalence classes. The function which maps any code C to the canonical representative of its equivalence class is called a canonical representative map. This map is realized by a proper algorithm which uses invariants. Using the canonical representative, we define an ordering of the coordinates of the code C. This ordering is unique only if [formula]. In the other cases there are [formula] such orderings. To take only the inequivalent codes we use a parent test for each code obtained in the first part of the algorithm. An example for such test is the following: A code passes the test if the added two coordinates during the construction are the biggest (last) two coordinates in the defined ordering.

Using the above algorithm, all inequivalent extremal doubly even self-dual codes as well as extremal singly even self-dual codes of length 40 were obtained. The calculations took about two months using four cores of a PC Intel i5 4 core processor. We have the following:

There are 10200655 inequivalent extremal singly even self-dual codes of length 40.

As a summary, we list in Table [\ref=Tab:40] the numbers NβSE(40) of inequivalent extremal singly even self-dual codes with weight enumerators W40,C,β.

For the weight enumerator W40,C,0, we list in Table [\ref=Tab:AutCR0] the numbers [formula] of inequivalent extremal singly even self-dual codes with automorphism groups of order [formula] and covering radii R. Since the shadow of C is a coset of C having minimum weight 8, we have that R  ≥  8. It follows from the classification that there is no extremal singly even self-dual code with R  ≥  9.

Automorphism groups

Here we consider automorphism groups of extremal self-dual codes of length 40. It can be shown without the classification that if a prime p divides the order of the automorphism group of an extremal self-dual code of length 40 then p∈{2,3,5,7,19} (see [\cite=BY40]). By [\cite=BHM40] and Theorem [\ref=thm:40], there are 10214125 extremal self-dual codes of length 40. Their automorphism groups are divided into 91 different orders. We present the number of the codes in respect to the order of their automorphism group in Table [\ref=Table:aut_groups].

The 9972575 codes (more than 97% of 10214125 codes) have a trivial automorphism group (group of order 1). This means that only 228849 codes have nontrivial automorphism groups. There are 189449 codes with automorphism group of order 2. So the codes with automorphism group of order 1 or 2 are more than 99.61% of all inequivalent codes. This calculation substantiates some conjectures from [\cite=BB38] and very small number of the codes have bigger automorphism groups.

Extremal singly even self-dual codes of length 40 having automorphisms of odd prime order p  ≥  5 were considered in [\cite=BY40]. Here we give the current knowledge on the existence of such codes for p  ≥  3.

p = 19: No such code exists for this case.

p = 7: Unfortunately, there is a mistake in [\cite=BY40] because there are six inequivalent extremal singly even self-dual codes of length 40 with an automorphism of order 7 - two codes with weight enumerator W40,C,8 and automorphism groups of orders 688128 = 215  ·  21 and 5376  =  28  ·  21, and four codes with weight enumerator W40,C,1 and automorphism groups of orders 4032  =  26  ·  63, 1008  =  24  ·  63, 21 and 14. Bouyuklieva and Yorgov [\cite=BY40] missed four of the codes because they had to consider five different supports for the codeword of weight 2 in π(Fσ(C)), namely {1,6}, {2,6}, {3,6}, {4,6} and {5,6}. So the codes with weight enumerator W40,C,8 could be constructed as a combination of the matrix H4 and π(Fσ(C)) with {2,6} as a support of the weight 2 vector, and H3 with {4,6} as this support. The additional two codes with weight enumerator W40,C,1 are obtained from H1 with {2,6} and H2 with {3,6} (see [\cite=BY40] for the details of the construction and for the matrices H1, H2, H3, H4).

p = 5: Exactly 39 inequivalent singly even self-dual codes of length 40 have an automorphism of order 5 - two codes more than it is stated in [\cite=BY40]. The authors missed there two codes with weight enumerator W40,C,0.

p = 3: Exactly 1986 inequivalent extremal singly even self-dual codes of length 40 have an automorphism of order 3.

We formulate these corrections on the cases p = 5 and 7.

There are exactly 6 and 39 inequivalent extremal singly even self-dual codes of length 40 having an automorphism of order 7 and 5, respectively.

Some observations

By the sphere-covering bound (see [\cite=A-P]), the covering radius of a self-dual code of length 40 is at least 6. From Tables [\ref=Tab:AutCR1] and [\ref=Tab:AutCR0], there are 501337 inequivalent extremal singly even self-dual codes of length 40 with covering radius 7, and there is no extremal singly even self-dual code with covering radius 6. Note that there are only two inequivalent extremal doubly even self-dual codes with covering radius 7, and there is no extremal doubly even self-dual code with covering radius 6 [\cite=BHM40]. By the Delsarte bound (see [\cite=A-P]), the covering radius of an extremal doubly even self-dual code of length 40 is at most 8. It follows from the classification that the covering radius of an extremal singly even self-dual code of the same length is also at most 8.

Let NDE(n) and NSE(n) be the numbers of inequivalent extremal doubly even self-dual codes and singly even self-dual codes of length n and minimum weight 4⌊n / 24⌋ + 4, respectively. Then it holds that

[formula]

It follows that 40 is the smallest length n with NDE(n)  <  NSE(n).

Odd unimodular lattices in dimension 40

For odd unimodular lattice, we consider a situation which is similar to that for singly even self-dual codes given in Section [\ref=Subsec:C]. We show that the number of vectors of norm 2 in the shadow of an extremal odd unimodular lattice in dimension 40 is at most 80. We also give a classification of extremal odd unimodular lattices in dimension 40 with shadows having 80 vectors of norm 2.

Frames of Type A, B and C

Let L be an even integral lattice in dimension n. Let [formula] be vectors of [formula] satisfying

[formula]

where δij is the Kronecker delta. If the vectors [formula] satisfy the following conditions

[formula]

then the set of these vectors is called a frame of Type A, B and C related to L, respectively [\cite=KKM].

Let D be a doubly even code of length [formula]. Let [formula] be vectors of [formula] satisfying (ei,ej) = 2δij for 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n. Set [formula], [formula] (ε = 0,1). The following lattices are defined in [\cite=KKM]:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] denotes the support of x. These lattices and their relationships with frames of Type A, B and C are investigated in [\cite=KKM]. For example, if D is a doubly even self-dual code of length 40 and minimum weight 4 (resp. 8), then [formula] is an even unimodular lattice with minimum norm 2 (resp. 4) [\cite=KKM]. In addition, the following result is an important tool in this section.

For U =   A, B, C, a mapping [formula] gives a one-to-one correspondence between equivalence classes of doubly even codes D of length n and isomorphism classes of even lattices in dimension n with related frames of Type U, if n > 16 for U =   B and if n > 32 for U =   C.

As an example of the above lemma, we directly have the following result from the classification of doubly even self-dual codes of length 40 in [\cite=BHM40].

There are 94343 non-isomorphic extremal even unimodular lattices in dimension 40 with related frames of Type C, 16470 of which are extremal.

Theta series

Let L be an odd unimodular lattice in dimension [formula]. Suppose that L and its shadow S have minimum norms ≥  4 and 2, respectively. Then all vectors of norm 2 in S are contained in one of L1 and L3.

Let x,y be distinct vectors of norm 2 in S. Since x - y∈L,

[formula]

Suppose that x∈L1. Since L*0 / L0 is isomorphic to the Klein 4-group (see e.g. [\cite=DHS]), - x∈L1. Hence, we may assume without loss of generality that (x,y)  ≥  0. If y∈L3, then, by [\cite=DHS], [formula]. This contradicts ([\ref=eq:ip]).

Conway and Sloane [\cite=CS-odd] show that when the theta series of an odd unimodular lattice L in dimension n is written as

[formula]

the theta series of the shadow S is written as

[formula]

where [formula] and θ2(q),θ3(q) and θ4(q) are the Jacobi theta series [\cite=SPLAG]. In the case n = 40 and minimum norm min (L) = 4, [formula] in ([\ref=Eq:theta]) are determined as follows:

[formula]

In this case, it follows that

[formula]

Hence, a5 = 0 and a4 is divisible by 28, so we put a4 = 28α, where α is an integer. Then we have the possible theta series θ40,L,α and θ40,S,α of an extremal odd unimodular lattice L and its shadow S:

[formula]

respectively. Moreover, we have the following restriction on α.

α is even with 0  ≤  α  ≤  80.

Denote by S2 the set of all vectors of norm 2 in S. By Lemma [\ref=lem:L1], we may assume without loss of generality that all vectors of S2 are contained in L1. Let x,y be vectors of norm 2 in L1 such that x  ≠  y and x  ≠   - y. If y∈L1 then - y∈L1. Hence, α is even and we may assume that (x,y)  ≥  0. It follows from ([\ref=eq:ip]) that (x,y) = 0. The set S2 is written as

[formula]

satisfying that (x,y) = 0 for x,y∈T with x  ≠  y. Hence, #  T  ≤  40, and L1 has at most 80 vectors of norm 2. Therefore, α  ≤  80.

Let L be an extremal odd unimodular lattice in dimension 40 with theta series θ40,L,α. Then one of [formula] and [formula] is an extremal even unimodular lattice and the remaining one is an even unimodular lattice containing α vectors of norm 2.

Follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:L1] and θ40,S,α.

Lattices with theta series θ40,L,80

Now we suppose that L is an extremal odd unimodular lattice in dimension 40 with shadow S having exactly 80 vectors of norm 2, that is, L and S have the following theta series:

[formula]

respectively.

There is a frame of Type B related to the even sublattice L0.

By the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:80], the set of all vectors of norm 2 in S may be written as [formula], where [formula] satisfying the condition ([\ref=eq:C1]). Then

[formula]

Hence, [formula] satisfy the condition ([\ref=eq:CB]).

We are in a position to state and prove the main result of this section.

There are 16470 non-isomorphic extremal odd unimodular lattices in dimension 40 with theta series θ40,L,80.

Let L be an extremal odd unimodular lattice in dimension 40 with theta series θ40,L,80. By Lemma [\ref=lem:L0], there is a frame of Type B related to the even sublattice L0. Hence, by Theorem 1 in [\cite=KKM], there is a doubly even code C of length 40 such that [formula]. Since [formula] is a sublattice of index 2 of an even unimodular lattice [formula], C must be self-dual. Since [formula] has minimum norm 4, C has minimum weight 8, that is, extremal.

Moreover, by Lemma [\ref=lem:KKM3], a mapping [formula] gives a one-to-one correspondence between equivalence classes of extremal doubly even self-dual codes C of length 40 and isomorphism classes of even sublattices of extremal odd unimodular lattices in dimension 40 with theta series θ40,L,80. There are 16470 inequivalent extremal doubly even self-dual codes of length 40 [\cite=BHM40]. The result follows.

A similar argument can be found in [\cite=CS-odd] for dimension n = 32. There is a one-to-one correspondence between equivalence classes of extremal doubly even self-dual codes of length 32 and isomorphism classes of even sublattices of extremal odd unimodular lattices in dimension 32 with shadows having exactly 64 vectors of norm 2. In this dimension, the shadow of any extremal odd unimodular lattice has 64 vectors of norm 2. By Lemma [\ref=lem:L1], the 64 vectors of norm 2 of the shadow are contained in one of L1 and L3. It is incorrectly reported in [\cite=CS-odd] that each Li has 32 vectors of norm 2 (i = 1,3).

Now we give characterizations of the set of vectors of minimum norm in extremal odd unimodular lattices with theta series θ40,L,80. By the above theorem, the even sublattice of such a lattice is written by [formula] using some extremal doubly even self-dual code C of length 40.

The set of vectors of norm 4 in [formula] is given by

[formula]

where C8 is the set of codewords of weight 8.

The norm of a vector of [formula] is 4. Since #  C8 = 285 [\cite=Mallows-Sloane], it follows that [formula], which is the same as the number of vectors of norm 4 in [formula].

By Lemmas [\ref=lem:L1] and [\ref=lem:L1L3], the even unimodular neighbor [formula] is extremal. Then [formula] is written as [formula], where [formula] and C is some extremal doubly even self-dual code C of length 40 (see Remark [\ref=rem:E]). An even unimodular lattice in dimension 40 has the following theta series [formula]. By the above proposition, the set of vectors of norm 4 in [formula] is also given by [formula].

In Proposition [\ref=prop:Cmin], the set of codewords of minimum weight in an extremal singly even self-dual code of length 40 with weight enumerator W40,C,10 has been characterized. Similarly, we give a characterization of the set of vectors of minimum norm in an extremal odd unimodular lattices in dimension 40 with theta series θ40,L,80. It is known that the set of vectors of each norm in an extremal even unimodular lattice in dimension 40 forms a spherical 3-design (see [\cite=BB09] for a recent survey on these subjects). By the above remark, we have the following:

The set of vectors of minimum norm in an extremal odd unimodular lattice in dimension 40 with theta series θ40,L,80 forms a spherical 3-design.

Extremal self-dual [formula]-codes and extremal odd unimodular lattices

Let C be a self-dual [formula]-code of length n and minimum Euclidean weight dE(C). Then the following lattice

[formula]

is a unimodular lattice in dimension n having minimum norm min {4,dE(C) / 4}. In addition, C is Type II if and only if A4(C) is even [\cite=Z4-BSBM]. A set [formula] of n vectors [formula] of a unimodular lattice L in dimension n with (fi,fj)  =  4δij is called an orthogonal frame of norm 4 (a 4-frame for short) of L. It is known that L has an orthogonal frame of norm 4 if and only if there is a self-dual [formula]-code C with [formula].

Suppose that n is even. Let L be an even (resp. odd) unimodular lattice in dimension n such that there are vectors [formula] satisfying the condition that [formula] which is the same condition as ([\ref=eq:C1]). Then L contains an orthogonal frame of norm 4 and there is a Type II (resp. Type I) [formula]-code C of length n with [formula].

The following set

[formula]

is an orthogonal frame of norm 4 of L. The result follows.

We consider the existence of extremal self-dual [formula]-codes.

There are at least 16470 inequivalent extremal Type II [formula]-codes of length 40. There are at least 16470 inequivalent extremal Type I [formula]-codes of length 40.

Since the two cases are similar, we give details only for Type I [formula]-codes. By Theorem [\ref=thm:odd], 16470 non-isomorphic extremal odd unimodular lattices Li [formula] in dimension 40 exist (see Remark [\ref=rem:E] for extremal even unimodular lattices). Moreover, for each Li, there are vectors [formula] satisfying the condition that [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:Z4], there is a Type I [formula]-code Ci of length 40 with [formula] for [formula]. Since [formula] are non-isomorphic extremal odd unimodular lattices, [formula] are inequivalent extremal Type I [formula]-codes of length 40.

Using the method given in [\cite=Z4-PLF], we found 16 new extremal Type I [formula]-codes Di ([formula]) of length 40, in order to give extremal odd unimodular lattices A4(Di) with other theta series θ40,L,4k, where [formula]. Since a Type I [formula]-code C of length 40 is extremal if and only if A4(C) is extremal, we verified that odd unimodular lattices A4(Di) are extremal. Also, the theta series of A4(Di) were determined by obtaining the numbers of vectors of minimum norm. Then we have the following:

There is an extremal odd unimodular lattice with theta series θ40,L,4k for [formula].

As an example, we give a generator matrix G of the Type I [formula]-code D1 such that A4(D1) has theta series θ40,L,0, which is s-extremal in the sense of [\cite=Ga07]. Since G is of the form [formula] we only list the matrices A and 2B in Figure [\ref=Fig], to save space, where Ik denotes the identity matrix of order k and O denotes the 20  ×  10 zero matrix.

The 16 codes Di ([formula]) slightly improve the number of known extremal Type I [formula]-codes of length 40 given in Proposition [\ref=prop:Z4], that is, there are at least 16486 inequivalent extremal Type I [formula]-codes of length 40. Generator matrices for all codes Di can be obtained electronically from "+http://sci.kj.yamagata-u.ac.jp/ mharada/Paper/z4-40.txt+".
