Perturbations of weakly expanding critical orbits

Introduction

We say that a critical point c of a rational function f is weakly expanding, or summable, if, for the point v = f(c) of the Riemann sphere [formula],

[formula]

Throughout the paper, derivatives are standard derivatives of holomorphic maps; then the summand in ([\ref=summ]) is a finite number for every [formula] as soon as v is not a critical point of fn.

In the present paper, we study perturbations of polynomials and rational functions with several (possibly, not all) summable critical points. The paper is a natural continuation of [\cite=Le], [\cite=mult], and partly [\cite=lpade],  [\cite=LSY]. Let us state main result for rational functions (for a more complete account, see Theorem [\ref=onerat]). We call a rational function exceptional, if it is double covered by an integral torus endomorphism (another name: a flexible Lattes map): these form a family of explicitly described critically finite rational maps with Julia sets the Riemann sphere, see e.g. [\cite=dht], [\cite=mcm], [\cite=mill]. Two rational functions are equivalent, if they are conjugated by a Mobius transformation. If ft(z) = zd + t, the limit above is a similarity factor between the dynamical and the parameter planes, see [\cite=R-L0].

Let us list some cases when the set K defined above has zero Lebesgue measure.

(1). Suppose that every critical point c of f satisfies the Misiurewicz condition, i.e., c lies in the Julia set J of f and ω(c) contains no critical points and parabolic cycles. Then ω(c) is an invariant hyperbolic set of f (by Mane's Hyperbolicity Theorem [\cite=ma]). By the bounded distortion property, it follows that ω(c) is of measure zero. Therefore, if c1,...,cp' satisfy the Misiurewicz condition, the Lebesgue measure |K| of K is zero.

(2). If all critical points satisfy the Collet-Eckmann condition (which clearly implies the summability), and the ω-limit set of each of them is not the whole sphere, then the measure of their union is zero [\cite=PR]. See also [\cite=PR1] for a rigidity result for Collet-Eckmann holomorphic maps.

(3). If all the critical points in the Julia set J of a rational function f are summable, f has no neutral cycles, and J is not the whole sphere, then the Lebesgue measure of J is equal to zero  [\cite=BS], [\cite=R-L]. In particular, |K| = 0. Moreover, as in the case (2), if [formula], it is enough to assume that the ω-limit set of each of them is not the whole sphere, and then again |K| = 0 (the proof follows from [\cite=RS], as explained in [\cite=R-L1]).

Theorem [\ref=tworatintro] being applied in the case (1) of the list above yields the following corollary first obtained in [\cite=S]. Let f be a non-exceptional rational function of degree d. Assume that every critical point cj of f, 1  ≤  j  ≤  2d - 2, is simple and satisfies the Misiurewicz condition. Replacing if necessary f by its equivalent, one can assume that the set [formula] does not contain infinity. Let fλ be a family of rational maps of degree d which depends (complex) analytically on λ∈N, where N is a 2d - 2-dimensional complex manifold, and fλ0 = f. In particular, there exist analytic functions cj(λ), 1  ≤  j  ≤  2d - 2, such that cj(λ) are the critical points of fλ, cj(λ0) = cj. Furthermore, since the set [formula] is hyperbolic for f, it persists for fλ, for λ in some neighborhood W of λ0: there exists a continuous map [formula] (here z(λ) is the "holomorphic motion" of the point z∈K), so that z = z(λ0)∈K, the functions z(λ) are analytic in W, and, moreover, for each λ∈W, the points z(λ) are different for different initial points z = z(λ0), and the set K(λ) = {z(λ)} is an invariant hyperbolic set for fλ. See Subsection [\ref=mainres] for the details and for an asymptotics of the inverse to the derivative of [formula].

Let us make some further comments. In [\cite=ts], Theorem [\ref=tworatintro] was shown for real quadratic polynomials which satisfy the Collet-Eckmann condition (to be precise, Tsujii proves that the limit ([\ref=familyratintro]) is positive for real Collet-Eckmann maps t - x2). For all quadratic polynomials with the summable critical point, Theorem [\ref=tworatintro] was originally proven in [\cite=Le] (see also [\cite=Av]). In turn, Corollary [\ref=misiu] had been known before for the quadratic polynomial family, in the case of a strictly preperiodic critical point [\cite=dh]. See also  [\cite=R-L0] for Corollary [\ref=misiu] for the family zd + c, and  [\cite=be] for a proof in the particular case of Corollary [\ref=misiu] when each critical point is strictly preperiodic.

Here we state another corollary of Theorem [\ref=tworatintro], which is close to the main result of [\cite=mak], see Comment [\ref=tha] below. Recall the following terminology. Let X be a complex manifold, and fλ(z), λ∈X, be a holomorphic family of rational maps over X. The map fλ0 is called structurally (respectively, quasiconformally) stable in X, if there exists a neighborhood U of λ0, such that: (a) fλ0 and fλ are topologically (respectively, quasiconformally) conjugated, for every λ∈U, (b) the conjugacy tends to the identity map as λ  →  λ0. By a fundamental result of [\cite=MSS], [\cite=mcmsul], the sets of structurally stable and quasiconformally stable rational maps in X coincide, and, moreover, the quasiconformal conjugacies form a holomorphic motion. In particular, the condition (b) of the definition follows from (a). (We will not use these results though.) In the next statement, f is not necessarily non-exceptional. Note that the set of functions Xf and the manifold Λf appeared in Theorem [\ref=tworatintro] are defined without any changes for all maps f (including the exceptional ones), see Subsection [\ref=disc] and Proposition [\ref=gen] in particular. For the proof, see Subsection [\ref=mainres].

For other results about the transversality, see [\cite=mult], preprint [\cite=e1], and also [\cite=Gau]. For dynamical and statistical properties of one-dimensional and rational maps under different summability conditions, see [\cite=NS], [\cite=GS],  [\cite=BS], [\cite=R-L], [\cite=RS].

The main results of the paper are contained in Theorem [\ref=one] (plus Comment [\ref=onecoro]) for polynomials, and in Theorem [\ref=onerat] and Theorem [\ref=tworatintro] (stated above) for rational functions. See also Comment [\ref=last] for a generalization which takes into account non-repelling cycles, and Propositions [\ref=main] and [\ref=mainrat], which are of an independent interest. As usual, the polynomial case is more transparent and technically easier, so we consider it separately, see Section [\ref=poly]. Proposition [\ref=dergenlem] and Lemma [\ref=formula] of this Section are more general and used also in the next Section [\ref=rat], where, by the same method, we treat the case of rational functions.

One of the main tools of the paper is a Ruelle (or pushforward) operator Tf associated to a rational map f (see Subsection [\ref=sectruelle]). It is introduced to the field of complex dynamics by Thurston, see [\cite=dht], and is used widely since then. A fundamental property of the operator (observed by Thurston) is that it is contracting (see Subsection [\ref=wd]). The method of the proof of Theorem [\ref=one] and Theorem [\ref=onerat] consists in applying the following three basic components: (i) explicit (formal) identities involving the Ruelle operator, which are established in [\cite=LSY] (as a formula for the resolvent of Tf and in the case when f has simple critical points), see also [\cite=lpade]; this allows us to construct explicitely an integrable fixed point of the operator Tf assuming that the determinant of some matrix vanishes (in other words, if some vectors of the coefficients in the identities are linearly dependent), (ii) the contraction property of the operator together with (i) lead to the conclusion that the vectors of the coefficients are linearly independent. The scheme (i)-(ii) appeared in [\cite=Le], where the unicritical case was treated, and then applied in [\cite=mak] for rational functions with simple critical points, and in [\cite=mult].

The last component, which is the key new part of the paper, is as follows: (iii) a formula for the coefficients of the identities for an arbitrary polynomial or rational function via the derivative with respect to the canonical local coordinates in some functional spaces, see Propositions [\ref=main]-[\ref=vaznoe] and [\ref=mainrat]-[\ref=vaznoerat].

Throughout the paper we use the following convention about the notations. Let f∈N, and x̄(g) = {x1(g),...,xl(g)} be a (local, near f) holomorphic coordinate of g in the space N. If [formula] is a function which is defined and analytic in a neighborhood W of f in the space N, we denote by [formula] the partial derivative of P(g) w.r.t. xk(g) calculated at the point x̄(f), i.e., at g = f. For example, [formula] denotes [formula] evaluated at g = f. Furthermore, if P = gm, we denote [formula] to be [formula] evaluated at g = f. For a rational function g(z), g' always means the derivative w.r.t. [formula]. For instance, [formula] means [formula] calculated at the point f. Note also that for a critical point c(g) = cj(g) of g, we have: [formula], where c = c(f).

Acknowledgments. The paper was inspired by a recent question by Weixiao Shen to the author about a generalization of Corollary 1 (b) of [\cite=Le] to higher degree polynomials. The answer is contained in Theorem [\ref=one]. In turn, it has been used recently in [\cite=gash].

Polynomials

Polynomial spaces

Let f be a monic centered polynomial of degree d  ≥  2, i.e., it has the form

[formula]

Consider the space Πd of all monic and centered polynomials of the same degree d. Vector of coefficients of g∈Πd defines a (global) coordinate in Πd and identifies Πd with [formula].

Let C = {c1,...,cp} be the set of all different critical points of f, with the vector of multiplicities   =  {m1,m2,...,mp}, so that f'(z) = dΠpi = 1(z - ci)mi.. Now, we consider a local subspace Πd, of Πd associated to the polynomial f, as in [\cite=mult]: In particular, [formula] consists of all monic centered polynomials of degree d close to f if and only if all the critical points of f are simple. At the other extreme case, the space Πd, consists of the unicritical family zd + v.

Note that some of the critical values v1,...,vp of f may coincide.

Consider the vector of critical values V(g) = {v1(g),...,vp(g)}, where vi(g) = g(ci(g)). The set Πd, is an analytic subset of Πd. The following fact is proved in Proposition 1 of [\cite=mult]:

Πd, is a p-dimensional complex analytic manifold, and the vector V(g) is a local analytic coordinate in Πd,.

Main result

Indeed, let vk(t) be the critical value of ft, such that vk(0) = vk. Denote ak = v'k(0). As ft∈Λ, [formula], where at least one of aki must be non zero. On the other hand, the limit Rj in ([\ref=family]) can be represented as [formula]. Therefore, [formula], where at least one of aki is not zero. Now, if we assume that Rj = 0 for every 1  ≤  j  ≤  r, then the matrix (L(cj,vki))1  ≤  j  ≤  r,1  ≤  i  ≤  r degenerates, which is a contradiction.

Proof of Part (a) of Theorem [\ref=one]

Dependence on the local coordinates.

Suppose that a polynomial or a rational function f is included in a space N of polynomials or rational functions g with coordinates x̄(g) = {x1(g),...,xl(g)}, see Comment [\ref=nota]. Fix a critical point [formula] of f of multiplicity m  ≥  1, and let c(g) be the critical point of g of the multiplicity m which is close to c, if g is close to f. Consider also the corresponding critical value v(g) = g(c(g)). Recall that, according to our convention, [formula], [formula], [formula], etc. mean respectively [formula], [formula], [formula], etc.

Assume that c and v = f(c) lie in [formula]. Then the function

[formula]

has at z = c a zero of multiplicity at least m.

Fix a point [formula] so that [formula]. For every g in the space N which is close to f, we may write:

[formula]

and this holds for every z in the plane with [formula]. Hence,

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Comparing this with ([\ref=2rat]), we have:

[formula]

As c(g) is an m-multiple root of g', we get:

[formula]

where r(z) is a holomorphic function near c. Hence, as z  →  c,

[formula]

This proves the statement.

Now, we let N = Πd, and calculate the partial derivatives of a function f∈Πd, w.r.t. the local coordinates.

For every k = 1,...,p, the function [formula] is a polynomial pk(z) of degree at most d - 2 which is uniquely characterized by the following condition: pk(z) - 1 has zero at ck of order at least mk, while for every [formula], pk(z) has zero at cj of order at least mj. In particular, [formula] (here and later on we use the notation δj,k = 1 if j = k and δj,k = 0 if [formula]); if ck is simple (i.e., mk = 1), then

[formula]

Since the coefficients of g∈Πd, are holomorphic functions of V(g) and g is centered, the function [formula] is indeed a polynomial in z of degree at most d - 2. Hence, it is enough to check that it satisfies the characteristic property of the polynomial pk(z). But since [formula], this is a direct corollary of Proposition [\ref=dergenlem] applied for the coordinate x̄ = V and the critical point c(g) = cj(g).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=one], Part (a).

The following identity is easy to verify:

[formula]

Letting here z  →  cj, one gets:

[formula]

As we know, [formula]. Besides, [formula] is a polynomial of degree at most d - 2. Hence, for some constant Ck and all z,

[formula]

Now, assume that cj is weakly expanding. As cj∈J, the sequence {fn(vj)}n  ≥  0 is uniformly bounded. Then ([\ref=bdd]) and the summability condition ([\ref=summ]) imply that the series [formula] converges absolutely. Thus we have:

[formula]

This ends the proof of Part (a) of Theorem [\ref=one].

The following corollary is immediate from ([\ref=serl]),

The Ruelle operator and an operator identity.

The operator.

As in the proof of Corollary 1(b) of [\cite=Le], the main tool for us is the following linear operator Tf accosiated to a rational function f, which acts on functions as follows:

[formula]

provided x is not a critical value of f.

Next statement is about an arbitrary rational function which fixes infinity.

Let f be any rational function so that f(  ∞  ) =   ∞  . Let cj, j = 1,...,p be all geometrically different critical points of f lying in the complex plane [formula], such that the corresponding critical values vj = f(cj), j = 1,...,p, are also in [formula]. Denote by mj the multiplicity of cj, j = 1,...,p. Then there are functions L1(z),...,Lp(z) as follows. For every [formula], which is not a critical point of f, for every [formula] which is not a critical value of f and such that [formula], we have:

[formula]

Furthermore, each function Lj obeys the following two properties:

(1) Lj is a meromorphic function in the complex plane of the form:

[formula]

(2) for every k = 1,...,p, the function f'(z)Lj(z) - δj,k has zero at the point ck of order at least mj.

Fixing z,x as in the lemma, take R big enough and consider the integral

[formula]

As the integrant is O(1 / w2) at infinity, I = 0. On the other hand, applying the Residue Theorem,

[formula]

Here

[formula]

Near c = cj, f'(w) = (w - c)mr(w), where m = mj and r = rj is holomorphic with [formula]. Denote

[formula]

where qk = q(j)k and [formula]. We can write:

[formula]

We see from here that Ij(z,x) = Lj(z) / (x - f(cj)), where Lj(z) has precisely the form ([\ref=tochno]). Now, consider (z) = f'(z)Lj(z). By ([\ref=tochno]), (z) has zero at every [formula] of order at least mk. On the other hand, as z  →  cj, then

[formula]

[formula]

where g is holomorphic near cj. This finishes the proof of the property (2).

As a simple corollary of the last two statements we have:

Let f∈Πd,. Then

[formula]

By the property (1) of Lemma [\ref=formula], f'(z)Lk(z) is a polynomial of degree at most d - 2, which, by the property (2) of Lemma [\ref=formula], coincides with the polynomial [formula] introduced in Proposition [\ref=derlem]. Therefore, indeed, [formula].

The operator identity and its corollary.

Let f∈Πd,. We have (in formal series):

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

for λ complex parameter and z,x complex variables.

We use Proposition [\ref=param] and write (in formal series):

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Putting in Proposition [\ref=main] λ = 1 and z = vj and combining it with ([\ref=serl]), see the proof of Theorem [\ref=one] (a) in Section [\ref=pra], we get:

Let cj be a summable critical point of f∈Πd,. Then

[formula]

where

[formula]

Proof of Part (b) of Theorem [\ref=one]

The proof is very similar to the one of Corollary 1(b) of [\cite=Le], where the family of unicritical polynomials is considered (see also [\cite=mak], [\cite=mult] and references therein). But some additional considerations are needed, if the number of summable critical points is more than one and their critical values coincide. Denote by S the set of indexes of given collection of r summable critical points of f. Assume the contrary, i.e., the rank of the matrix [formula] is less than r. This holds if and only if there exist numbers aj, for j∈S, which are not all zeros, such that, for every 1  ≤  k  ≤  p,

[formula]

Then, by Proposition [\ref=vaznoe],

[formula]

is an integrable fixed point of Tf which is holomorphic in each component of the complement [formula]. Let us show that H = 0 off J. We use that Tf is weakly contracting. Consider a component Ω of [formula]. If Ω is not a Siegel disk, then considering the backward orbit [formula] it is easy to find its open subset U, such that f- 1(U)  ⊂  U and [formula] is a non-empty open subset of Ω. Since H = TfH, we then have (the integration is against the Lebesgue measure on the plane):

[formula]

[formula]

which is possible only if H = 0 in [formula], hence, in Ω, because U  ⊂  Ω. And if Ω is a Siegel disk, we proceed as in the proof of Corollary 1(b) p. 190 of [\cite=Le] to show that H = 0 in Ω as well (see also Lemma [\ref=contr]). Thus, H = 0 off J. On the other hand, H can be represented as

[formula]

where the points bk∈J are pairwise different, and |αk| <   ∞  . Consider a measure with compact support [formula], where δ(z) is the Dirac measure at the point z. Then H = 0 off J implies that the measure μ annihilates any function which is holomorphic in a neighborhood of J. Indeed, for any such function r(z) and an appropriate contour γ enclosing J,

[formula]

[formula]

As every point of J belongs also to the boundary of the basin of infinity, by a corollary from Vitushkin's theorem (see e.g. [\cite=Ga]), every continuous function on J is uniformly approximated by rational functions. It follows, μ = 0, in other words, the representation ([\ref=hform]) is trivial:

[formula]

That is to say, the left hand side of ([\ref=hhj]) is zero:

[formula]

But, if the number of indexes in S is bigger than one, it does not imply immediately that all the numbers aj in ([\ref=h=0]) must vanish. Indeed, some Hj can even coincide: by the definition of the function Hj, see Proposition [\ref=vaznoe], Hj1 = Hj2, if vj1 = vj2. So, we will use ([\ref=rankl]) along with ([\ref=h=0]) to prove

ak = 0, for k∈S.

As the first step, we show that different functions Hj are linearly independent. Let us denote by Vi, 1  ≤  i  ≤  q, all the different critical values of f. For 1  ≤  i  ≤  q, introduce H̃i to be Hj, for every j, such that vj = Vi. The set of indexes S is a disjoint union of subsets Si, 1  ≤  i  ≤  e, so that j∈Si if and only if vj = Vi. Then

[formula]

We show that this representation is trivial: ãi = 0,   1  ≤  i  ≤  e. By Proposition [\ref=vaznoe],

[formula]

where {Vi} are pairwise different critical values of f. By contradiction, assume that some [formula]. Without loss of generality, one can assume further that i = 1, i.e., [formula]. Claim: V1 is a point of a periodic orbit P of f, and, moreover, if P contains some fk(Vj), k  ≥  0, with [formula], then Vj∈P. By ([\ref=tildeh]), the residue 1 of the first term in the sum ([\ref=tildeh1]) (with i = 1) must be cancelled. Hence, there is a critical value Vi1, so that V1 = fk1(Vi1) with [formula], for some minimal k1 > 0. If here [formula], then, by the same reason, there is Vi2, so that Vi1 = fk2(Vi2) with [formula], for some minimal k2 > 0. We continue until we arrive at a critical value that has been met before. This proves the Claim.

Denote by Vi0 = V1,Vi1,...,Vis all the different critical values which are points of the periodic orbit P and such that [formula], 0  ≤  l  ≤  s. Since Vil are periodic points, each H̃il, 0  ≤  l  ≤  s, is a rational function (see also ([\ref=dir2]) below). We have:

[formula]

where every ãil is non zero. Denote by T the (minimal) period of P. Changing indexes, if necessary, there are some 0 < n1 < n2 < ... < ns < T, such that

[formula]

The rest is a direct not difficult calculation. From ([\ref=tildeh1]) and ([\ref=ind]), for 1  ≤  l  ≤  s,

[formula]

while, if ρ = (fT)'(V1),

[formula]

(Note that |ρ| > 1, because V1 is summable.) If s = 0 (i.e., V1 is the only critical value Vi∈P such that [formula]), then H̃1 = 0, which is a contradiction with ([\ref=dir2]). Assume s > 0. By ([\ref=dir1]), the relation ([\ref=dir0]) turns into:

[formula]

where H̃1 is given by ([\ref=dir2]). Since 0  ≤  n1 - 1 < ... < ns - 1  ≤  T - 2 and the points {fn(V1)}T - 1n = 0 are pairwise different, the function on the right hand side of ([\ref=dir3]) has no pole at fT - 1(V1) while H̃1 has. Hence, [formula]. It means that the left hand side in ([\ref=dir3]) is zero identically. Hence, the function in the right hand side of ([\ref=dir3]) has no pole at fns - 1(V1), which is possible only if ãis = 0. This is already a contradiction, because, by our assumption, all ãil are non-zero numbers.

The contradiction shows that ãi = 0, for 1  ≤  i  ≤  e. To get from this that all ak = 0, we use Corollary [\ref=lemravnie], and rewrite ([\ref=rankl]), for every k∈S:

[formula]

This ends the proof of Theorem [\ref=one] (b), because this is a contradiction with the fact, that at least one aj, j∈S, is a non zero number.

Rational functions

Local spaces of rational maps

Let f be a rational function of degree d  ≥  2, such that

[formula]

where [formula], and Q, P are polynomials of degrees d - 1 and at most d - 2 respectively, which have no common roots. Without loss of generality, one can assume that Q(z) = zd - 1 + A1zd - 2 + ... + Ad - 1 and P(z) = B0zd - 2 + ... + Bd - 2.

Let p' stand for the number of distinct critical points c1,...,cp' of f. Note that all of them are different from ∞  . Denote by mj the multiplicity of cj, that is, the equation f(w) = z has precisely mj + 1 different solutions near cj for z near f(cj) and [formula], j = 1,...,p'. Observe that it is equivalent to say that, if [formula] where P̂(z) = Q(z)(σz + b) + P(z), then cj, for 1  ≤  j  ≤  p', is a root of the polynomial P̂'Q  -  P̂Q' of multiplicity mj. Note that [formula].

Let ' = {mj}p'j = 1 denote the vector of multiplicities. Let vj = f(cj), 1  ≤  j  ≤  p', be the corresponding critical values. We assume that some of them can coincide as well as some can be ∞  . By p we denote the number of critical points of f, so that their images (i.e., the corresponding critical values) lie in the complex plane.

As in [\cite=mult], we define a local (near f) space Λd,' of rational functions.

For g in a sufficiently small neighborhood of f in Λd,', introduce a vector [formula] as follows. Let us fix an order c1,...,cp' in the collection of all critical points of f. We will do it in such a way, that the first p indexes correspond to finite critical values, i. e. [formula] for 1  ≤  j  ≤  p and vj  =    ∞   for p < j  ≤  p' (if p < p'). Remark that p  ≥  1: there always at least one critical value in the plane. There exist p' functions c1(g),...,cp'(g) which are defined and continuous in a small neighborhood of f in Λd,', such that they constitute all different critical points of g. Moreover, cj(g) has the multiplicity mj, 1  ≤  j  ≤  p'. Define now the vector (g). If all critical values of f lie in the plane, then we set (g) = {σ(g),b(g),v1(g),...,vp'(g)}. If some of the critical values vj of f are infinity, that is, vj  =    ∞   for p < j  ≤  p', then we replace in the definition of (g) corresponding vj(g) by 1 / vj(g):

[formula]

In particular,   =  (f) = {σ,b,v1,...,vp,0,...,0}.

We can identify g∈Λd,' as above with the point

[formula]

of [formula]. Then Λd,' is an analytic variaty in [formula]. We denote it again by Λd,'. Every critical point cj of f of multiplicity mj is determined by mj - 1 algebraic equations. Therefore, Λd,' is defined by [formula] equations corresponding to the critical points. Thus the (complex) dimension of Λd,' is at least [formula]. In fact, as it is proved in [\cite=mult], Sect. 7:

Λd,' is a complex-analytic manifold of dimension p' + 2, and (g) defines a local holomorphic coordinate of g∈Λd,'.

Two rational functions are called close if they are uniformly close in the Riemann metric on the sphere. We call two rational functions (M-)equivalent if there is a Mobius transformation M which conjugates them. Every rational function f is equivalent to some [formula] of degree d  ≥  2 be of the form ([\ref=rrr]). Indeed, f has either a repelling fixed point, or a fixed point with the multiplier 1 (see e.g. [\cite=mil]). Hence, there exists a Mobius transformation P, such that ∞   is a fixed non-attracting point of [formula]. See also Section [\ref=disc].

If a critical value of f or its iterate is infinity, we consider also another space of rational maps which is biholomorphic to Λd,'. Let us fix a Mobius transformation M, such that α = M(  ∞  ) lies outside of the critical orbits {fn(ck):n  ≥  0,1  ≤  k  ≤  p'} of f. Then we make the same change of variable M for all maps from Λd,', and obtain a new space with a natural coordinate: The advantage of the new space is that the critical orbits of [formula] lie in the plane (although can be unbounded).

Subspaces

Suppose f is an arbitrary rational function of degree d  ≥  2. Denote by p' the number of different critical points of f in the Riemann sphere, and by ' the vector of multiplicities at the critical points. As it was mentioned, there is an alternative: either

(H): f has a fixed point a, such that [formula],

or

(N): the multiplier of every fixed point of f is either 0 or 1, and there is a fixed point with the multiplier 1.

The case (N) is degenerate. We consider each case separately.

(H). Let P be a Mobius transformation, such that P(a) =   ∞  . Then [formula] belongs to Λd,'. Moreover, P can be chosen uniquely in such a way, that b() = 0, and the critical value vp of [formula] is equal to 1. Let us define a submanifold [formula] of Λd,' consisting of g∈Λd,' in a neighborhood of [formula], such that b(g) = 0, and vp(g) = 1. The coordinate (g) in Λd,' restricted to [formula] is obviously a coordinate in that subspace, which turns it into a p'-dimensional complex manifold.

(N). There are two sub-cases to distinguish.

(NN): f has a fixed point a, such that f'(a) = 1 and [formula]. Let P be a Mobius transformation, such that P(a) =   ∞  . Then [formula] belongs to Λd,'. Moreover, P can be chosen uniquely in such a way, that vp() = 1 and b() = 1. Then we define [formula] to be the set of all g∈Λd,' in a neighborhood of [formula], such that b(g) = 1, and vp(g) = 1. Coordinates in [formula] is defined as in the previous case, and it turns [formula] into a p'-dimensional complex manifold.

(ND): every fixed point with multiplier 1 is degenerate. Let a be one of them: f'(a) = 1 and f''(a) = 0. Then the Mobius map P can be chosen uniquely in such a way, that [formula], and [formula] has a critical value equal to 1 in one attracting petal of ∞  , and equal to 0 in another attracting petal of ∞  . Then [formula] consists of g∈Λd,' in a neighborhood of [formula], such that the critical value of g which is close to vp - 1() = 1 is identically equal to 1, and the critical value of g, which is close to vp() = 0, is identically equal to 0. Then [formula] is a p'-dimensional complex manifold.

It is easy to check that in any of these cases, every ∈Λd,' is equivalent (by a linear conjugacy) to some [formula]. Let us drop the condition that maps fix infinity and consider the set [formula] of all rational functions ĝ of degree d which are close to [formula] and such that ĝ has p' different critical points with the same corresponding multiplicities. Then, since any such ĝ has a fixed point close to infinity, it is equivalent to some ∈Λd,' and, hence, to some [formula]. In any of the cases (H), (NN), (ND), we denote

[formula]

where the Mobius map P is taken as before. This shows the first part of the following statement.

(a) Every rational function f of degree d  ≥  2 is equivalent to some ∈Λd,', where [formula] is of one and only one type: either [formula] or [formula] or [formula]. If Xf denotes the set of all rational functions g of degree d which are close to f and such that g have p' distinct critical points with the same corresponding multiplicities, then any g∈Xf is equivalent to some g1∈Λf.

(b) In the case (H), the set Xf is a complex-analytic manifold of dimension p' + 3, and the correspondence π:g∈Xf  ↦  g1∈Λf is a well-defined holomorphic map.

Let us show (b). In this case [formula], hence, any [formula] has a unique fixed point β which is close to ∞  . This defines a one-to-one map [formula] between [formula] and Λd,' by [formula], where M(z) = βz / (β - z). It is also easy to see that in this case there is a natural map [formula] defined by [formula], where A(z) = kz + e with [formula] and [formula]. The vector [formula] defines a complex-analytic structure on [formula], and the map [formula] is holomorphic. Since, by ([\ref=XL]) above, Xf, Λf are isomorphic to [formula], [formula], the part (b) follows. Note in conclusion that the Mobius conjugacy between g∈Xf and g1∈Λf, which we just constructed, tends to the identity map uniformly on the Riemann sphere as g tends to f.

Main result

Clearly, C-compact sets must have empty interior. Vitushkin's theorem characterizes such compacts on the plane, see e.g. [\cite=Ga]. As a simple corollary of this theorem, we have that each of the following conditions is sufficient for K to be a C-compact set:

(1) K has Lebesgue measure zero,

(2) every z∈K belongs to the boundary of a component of the complement of K.

We call a rational function f exceptional if f is double covered by an integral torus endomorphism (also known as a flexible Lattes map): these form a family of explicitly described critically finite rational maps with Julia sets which are the whole Riemann sphere, see, for example, [\cite=dht], [\cite=mcm], [\cite=mill].

Let f∈Λd,'. Fix a Mobius transformation M, such that M(  ∞  ) is disjoint with the forward orbits of the critical points of f. (If [formula] for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  p' and all n  ≥  0, one can put M to be the identity map.) Consider [formula] in the space ΛMd,' with the coordinate M (see Definition [\ref=Mspace]). We denote by k = M- 1(ck), ṽk = M- 1(vk), 1  ≤  k  ≤  p', the corresponding critical points and critical values of [formula]. As usual, [formula] etc. means [formula] etc. evaluated at   =  .

Proof of Theorem [\ref=tworatintro].

We apply the part (b) of Theorem [\ref=onerat] exactly as we apply Theorem [\ref=one] in the Comment [\ref=onecoro], and then apply Proposition [\ref=gen]. This ends the proof.

Proof of Corollary [\ref=misiu]

Since [formula] is a hyperbolic set for f, and, hence, is of measure zero, Theorem [\ref=tworatintro] applies. As every critical point of f is simple and summable, p' = r = 2d - 2, i.e., Λ  =  Λf, and Xf is the (local) space of all close to f rational functions of degree d. Let x̄ = (x1,...,x2d - 2) be a local coordinate in Λ. Since all critical points of f are summable, f has no parabolic periodic orbits. Hence, f is of type [formula], and the part (b) of Proposition [\ref=gen] applies: Xf is a complex-analytic manifold, and the correspondence π:g∈Xf  ↦  ĝ∈Λf (from Proposition [\ref=gen] (a)) is a holomorphic map. Observe, that the restriction of π on N  ⊂  Xf is one-to-one, because otherwise two different g1,g2∈N would be equivalent to the same π(g1) = π(g2). Hence, the restriction π|N:N  →  Λf is a local analytic isomorphism. This is equivalent to say that, in the coordinates λ of N and x̄ of Λ, the derivative of π|N at λ0 is a non-degenerate (2d - 2)  ×  (2d - 2) matrix π'0. In turn, the part (b) of Theorem [\ref=tworatintro] is equivalent to the statement that the matrix [formula], where

[formula]

is non-degenerate. The rest of the proof is a straightforward application of this fact. For every l big enough, we introduce the following objects:

(1) an approximation matrix [formula], where

[formula]

(2) two maps from the neighborhood W of λ0 into [formula]: the map Cl(λ) = {flλ(cj(λ))}1  ≤  j  ≤  2d - 2, and the map āl(λ) = {aj(λ)}1  ≤  j  ≤  2d - 2 (recall that z(λ) is the holomorphic motion of the point z = z(λ0)∈K, and aj = fl(cj)∈K),

(3) a diagonal 2d - 2  ×  2d - 2 matrix Dl with the diagonal (j,j) element (fl - 1)'(vj), 1  ≤  j  ≤  2d - 2. Note that (fl - 1)'(vj)  →    ∞   as l  →    ∞  .

Since the family of analytic functions {z(λ)}, where λ∈W, is bounded, then the norms of the derivative ā'l of āl(λ) at λ0 are uniformly (in l) bounded, too. By the definition, [formula], hence, for the derivatives at λ  =  λ0, [formula]. By linear algebra, we have a representation:

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

As l tends to ∞  , [formula] tends to the invertible matrix [formula], and D- 1l tends to zero matrix. It follows, for every l big enough, l' is invertible. Moreover, asymptotically, [formula] is [formula]. This ends the proof.

Proof of Corollary [\ref=cormak]

Let us first consider the case when f is exceptional [\cite=dht]. Since all critical points of f are simple, then Xf is the (local) space of all rational functions [formula] of degree d which are close to f, and Λf is its 2d - 2-dimensional submanifold. As f has no neutral cycles, by Proposition [\ref=gen] (b), we have a well-defined map g∈Xf  ↦  g1∈Λf, where g is equivalent to g1, and the Mobius conjugacy between them tends to the identity uniformly on the Riemann sphere as g  →  f (see the end of Subsection [\ref=disc]). It implies that f is structurally stable in Xf if and only if f is structurally stable in Λf. On the other hand, as f is critically finite, it is easy to see that the critical relations of f cannot be preserved for all maps in [formula] which are close to f. Hence, f is not structurally stable in Xf and, then, in Λf.

Now, let f be a non-exceptional map. One can assume that ω(c) is a subset of the complex plane. By applying Theorem [\ref=tworatintro] to f and c, there exists a one-dimentional submanifold Λ (i.e., an analytic one-dimensional family ft, f0 = f) of Λf, such that the limit

[formula]

exists and is a non-zero number. (Here c(t) is the critical point of ft which is close to c(0) = c.) This obviously implies that

[formula]

This is enough to conclude that f is not structurally stable in the family ft, hence, in Λf, too. Indeed, assuming, by a contradiction, that f is structurally stable in ft, we get that the ω-limit set ω(c(t)) of the critical point c(t) of ft tends to ω(c(0)) = ω(c) as t  →  0 while the compact ω(c) lies in the plane. In particular, the sequence of holomorphic functions {fmt(c(t))}m  ≥  0 is uniformly bounded in a neigborhood of t = 0, which is a contradiction with ([\ref=notnormcor]). This ends the proof.

Part (a) of Theorem [\ref=onerat]

As in the polynomial case, we start by calculating partial derivatives of a function g∈Λd,' w.r.t. the standard local coordinates of the space Λd,', i.e., σ, b, and the critical values which are not infinity.

Fix a function f∈Λd,', where f(z) = σz  +  b  +  P(z) / Q(z).

(a) Let vk = f(ck) be a critical value of f which is different from infinity (i.e., 1  ≤  k  ≤  p). Then [formula] is a rational function qk(z) of degree 2d - 2 be of the form [formula], where P̃ is a polynomial of degree at most 2d - 3. It is uniquely characterized by the following conditions:

(i) at z = ck, the function qk(z) - 1 has zero of order at least mk;

(ii) at z = cj, for every [formula], 1  ≤  j  ≤  p, qk(z) has zero of order at least mj;

(iii) finally, at z = cj, for every p + 1  ≤  j  ≤  p', the polynomial P̃(z) has zero of order at least mj.

In particular, if ck is simple (i.e., mk = 1), then ([\ref=dersimp]) holds:

[formula]

(b) We have, as well:

[formula]

Let x be one of the following coordinates of the vector (g), for g∈Λd,: x is either vk, for 1  ≤  k  ≤  p, or σ, or b. Notice that, for x = vk:

[formula]

and, for x = σ or x = b:

[formula]

As g∈Λd,' is close to f, then [formula], where Pg(z) = B0(g)zd - 2 + ..., Qg(z) = zd - 1 + ... are polynomials with the coefficients which are holomorphic functions of the vector (g), and Pf = P, Qf = Q. It follows, [formula], where [formula] is a polynomial of degree at most 2d - 3. We apply Proposition [\ref=dergenlem] to the coordinate x as above and take into account ([\ref=xvk])-([\ref=xother]). We conclude that, for every 1  ≤  j  ≤  p, cj is at least a mj-multiple zero of the functions [formula], [formula], and [formula]. In particular, all this proves the part (a) except for the last property (iii).

Let P̂(z) = (σz + b)Q(z) + P(z), that is, [formula]. Then [formula] is a rational function of the form [formula], where

[formula]

Now, let p + 1  ≤  j  ≤  p', i.e., cj is a root of Q(z), such that Q(z) = (z - cj)mj + 1ψ(z), where ψ is analytic near cj and [formula]. We cannot apply Proposition [\ref=dergenlem] directly in this case, because vj = f(cj) =   ∞  . To get around this, let us introduce a new (local) space N* consisting of the functions g*(z): = 1 / g(z), for g∈Λd,' near f. Notice that the vector (g) of coordinates in Λd,' is also a local coordinate in N*, the critical points of g* and g (with the corresponding multiplicities) coincide while for the critical values g* and g, we have: v*j(g*) = 1 / vj(g). In particular, v*j = f*(cj) = 0. Using the above notations, we have:

[formula]

On the other hand, we can apply Proposition [\ref=dergenlem] to the space N*, the map f*, its critical point cj (with the corresponding critical value to be 0), and the coordinate x. Since p < j  ≤  p', the critical value v*j(g*) = 1 / vj(g) of g* is just the j-coordinate of the vector of coordinates (g) in N*, while x (which is either vk(g), for 1  ≤  j  ≤  p, or σ(g), or b(g)) is a different coordinate of (g). Hence, we also have:

[formula]

Then, by Proposition [\ref=dergenlem], cj is at least mj-multiple root of [formula], hence, by ([\ref=hatn]), cj is at least mj-multiple root of Px(z), as well. In particular, this holds for P̃ = Pvk, which proves (iii) of part (a).

As for part (b), x is either σ or b. Let x = σ. Then

[formula]

where

[formula]

is a polynomial of degree at most 2d - 3, and Pσ = zQ2 + R. In particular, [formula]. On the other hand, as we have seen, for every 1  ≤  j  ≤  p, cj is at least a mj-multiple zero of [formula], and, for p < j  ≤  p', cj is at least a mj-multiple zero of Pσ. Therefore, [formula], and, at the same time, it is a rational function without poles in the plane. Hence, it must be equal to z / σ. The proof for ∂f / ∂b is very similar and is left to the reader.

As in the polynomial case, we then have:

Let f∈Λd,'. Then

[formula]

We use Lemma [\ref=formula] and the part (a) of Proposition [\ref=derlemrat]. By the assertions (1)-(2) of Lemma [\ref=formula], f'(z)Lk(z) is a rational function of the form P̃ / Q2, where P̃ is a polynomial of degree at most 2d - 3, such that f'(z)Lk(z) - 1 has root at ck with multiplicity at least mk, and, for every [formula], 1  ≤  j  ≤  p', the polynomial P̃ has root at cj with multiplicity at least mj. Hence, f'(z)Lk(z) coincides with the rational function qk(z). Therefore, indeed, [formula].

If vk  =    ∞   or z =   ∞  , Proposition [\ref=derlemrat] is not useful. In that case, we replace the space Λd,' by the space

[formula]

where M is a non-linear Mobius transformation, that is, [formula], [formula], and α is such that the forward orbits of critical points of f are different from α. Then the forward critical orbits of [formula] lie in the complex plane. Hence, for any l > 0, if g is close enough to f, then the first l iterates of the critical points of [formula] lie in the plane, too.

By Definition [\ref=Mspace], [formula] is a holomorphic function of σ(g), b(g), and the critical values vj() = M- 1(vj(g)) of [formula], 1  ≤  j  ≤  p'. By ṽj, j we denote vj(), cj(), i.e., the critical values and points of [formula]. In particular, ṽj  =  β if and only if p + 1  ≤  j  ≤  p'. As usual, {vk} denote the critical values of f, and ∂n  /  ∂ṽk means ∂n  /  ∂vk() calculated at   =  .

(a) Take l  ≥  1. If [formula] for 0  ≤  i  ≤  l - 1, then

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

(b) We have:

[formula]

[formula]

(a) Since [formula], vk(g) = M(vk()), where M is a fixed map, and by the conditions on vk,cj, the following calculations make sense:

[formula]

The proof of ([\ref=conMsigma])-([\ref=conMb]) is similar.

(b) Since [formula] for every ∈ΛMd,', we write:

[formula]

Since β is independent of g,

[formula]

and similar for the derivatives w.r.t. σ and b. To show ([\ref=conM0]), it remains to estimate ([\ref=2M]) at z = β. To show ([\ref=conMcr]), it is enough to apply Proposition [\ref=dergenlem] to the space ΛMd,, the map [formula], the critical point j, and the coordinate in the vector M, which is either ṽk or σ or b.

Proof of Part (a) of Theorem [\ref=onerat].

Here we state and prove a refined version of Theorem [\ref=onerat](a) introducing notations L(cj,vk), L(cj,σ), L(cj,b) to be used later on. Recall that the notations LM(cj,vk), LM(cj,σ), LM(cj,b) are introduced in Theorem [\ref=onerat].

(1) It is enough to prove ([\ref=limrata])-([\ref=limma]). Then, by ([\ref=conM])-([\ref=conMb]) of Proposition [\ref=derlemratM],  ([\ref=lmlv])-([\ref=lmlsigma]) follow. We can use the identity ([\ref=6]) of Subsection [\ref=pra]: for every l > 0,

[formula]

By the part (a) of Proposition [\ref=derlemrat], [formula], and, moreover, [formula] is a rational function of the form P̃ / Q2, where degree of P̃ is less than the degree of Q2. Hence, for some constant Ck and all z,

[formula]

Now, assume that cj is weakly expanding. Then

[formula]

and ([\ref=limrata]) follows. The proof of existence of L(cj,σ) and L(cj,b) is similar to the proof for vk-derivative. Indeed,

[formula]

Letting here z  →  cj and using the part (b) of Proposition [\ref=derlemrat], one gets:

[formula]

and we get ([\ref=limsigmaa]). Doing the same (with obvious changes) for the ∂  /  ∂b-derivative, we get ([\ref=limma]).

(2) We use ([\ref=nuzhnoa]) with [formula] instead of f. Note that fj(vj) =   ∞   if and only if j(ṽj) = β. Then j(ṽj) = β for every j  ≥  l, and, hence, for j  ≥  l, by Proposition [\ref=derlemratM] (b),

[formula]

That is,

[formula]

while, by Proposition [\ref=derlemratM] (a),

[formula]

This proves ([\ref=lmlv]) in the considered case. The proof of ([\ref=lmlsigma]) is similar.

(3). The relation ([\ref=limratMinfa]) follows directly from ([\ref=nuzhnoaa]) (with l = 1) and Proposition [\ref=derlemratM]. The proof of ([\ref=limratMinf1a]) is similar.

Next statement is a corollary from the previous Theorem [\ref=onerata]. It allows us to reduce evaluation of the rank of the matrix M, which is defined in Theorem [\ref=onerat] (b), to the evaluation of the rank of a simpler matrix [formula] defined below. Recall that the integer number ν between 0 and r is defined in Theorem [\ref=onerat] (b) as the maximal number of points from the collection cj1,...cjr, 1  ≤  j1 < ... < jr  ≤  p', of r summable critical points of f, such that the corresponding critical values are different from infinity. Moreover, if ν < r, the last r - ν indexes jν + 1,...,jr are p' - (r - ν - 1),...,p'.

Let us consider last r - ν rows of M, which correspond to indexes ji = p' - r + i of the summable critical points, for i = ν + 1,...,r. By Theorem [\ref=onerata] (3), on the i-row of M, for i = ν + 1,...,r, all elements are 0, except for the "diagonal" one, which is equal to 1: LM(cp' - r + i,vp' - r + i) = 1. In other words, the lower right hand corner of the matrix M contains the r - ν  ×  r - ν identity matrix. Therefore, the rank of M is bigger than or equal to r - ν plus the rank of M1. If we cross out some of the columns of M1, then the rank can only decrease. Hence, the rank of M1 is bigger than or equal to the rank of M2. In turn, its elements are the corresponding elements of the matrix [formula] defined above, but with the upper index M. Now, we employ the relations ([\ref=lmlv])-([\ref=lmlsigma]) of Theorem [\ref=onerata] and conclude that the ranks of M2 and [formula] are actually equal.

Part (b) of Theorem [\ref=onerat]

The Wolff-Denjoy series

Let {αk}∞k = 0, {bk}∞k = 0 (where [formula], for [formula]) be two sequences of complex numbers. Assume that

[formula]

It implies that two series

[formula]

converge absolutely. Define

[formula]

Then H is integrable in every disk Br  =  {|x| < r}. Indeed, if σx denotes the element of the Lebesgue measure on the plane of the variable x, then

[formula]

We define a kind of regularization of H at infinity as

[formula]

The name is justified by the following claim (which must be known though):

Ĥ is integrable at infinity.

For every n, the function 1 / (bn - x) + 1 / x + bn / x2 is integrable at infinity, and one can write, for r > 0:

[formula]

[formula]

where the constants Ci here and below depend only on r. Now, for every R big enough, and using the condition ([\ref=ab1]), we have:

[formula]

where C4 does not depend on R.

We need a contraction property of the operator Tf. This property is initially due to Thurston, see [\cite=dht]. The proof of the following claim is a minor variation of [\cite=dht], [\cite=e],  [\cite=mak], [\cite=mult]

Let H be defined by the series ([\ref=H]), under the condition ([\ref=ab1]), and the numbers A,B are defined by ([\ref=ab2]). Denote by K the closure (on the Riemann sphere) of the set {bk}:

[formula]

Assume that K has no interior points. Let f be a rational function with the asymptotics at infinity f(z) = σz  +  b  +  O(1 / z), such that H is a fixed point of the operator Tf associated to f.

(1) If A = B = 0, then either H = 0 on the complement Kc of K, or f is an exceptional map.

(2) If either |σ|  ≥  1 and b = 0, or A = 0 and σ = 1, then H = 0 on Kc, too.

Note that H is analytic in each component of Kc. Now, take R big enough and consider the disk D(R) = {|x| < R}. We claim that

[formula]

Indeed, in the case (1), this follows at once from the integrability of H at infinity. In the case (2), the conditions on σ imply that there is a > 0, such that

[formula]

(actually, f- 1(D(R))  ⊂  D(R), if |σ| > 1). On the other hand,

[formula]

Indeed, by Lemma [\ref=int], H(x) = Ĥ(x)  -  A / x  -  B / x2, where Ĥ is integrable at infinity. In particular, [formula]. But an easy calculation shows that the conditions in the case (2) guarantee that

[formula]

so ([\ref=limr]) is proved. This, along with ([\ref=f-1]), gives us ([\ref=limr2]) in the case (2).

Let us show that

[formula]

almost everywhere. Indeed, otherwise there is a set A  ⊂  D(R0) of positive measure (for some R0) and δ > 0, such that [formula] for x∈A. Then, for all R > R0,

[formula]

which contradicts ([\ref=limr2]). With ([\ref=tri]) holding almost everywhere, we proceed as in the above cited papers.

Let αk,bk,k  ≥  0 be two sequences of complex numbers, such that [formula] and the closure K on the Riemann sphere of the set {bk,k  ≥  0}, where the points bk are pairwise different, is a C-compact K. If [formula] is equal to 0 outside of K, then αk = 0 for every k.

(1) The case when K is a C-compact in the plane is classical, see e.g. [\cite=bsz] (and also the proof of Theorem [\ref=one]). (2) Now, assume that ∞  ∈K. Take [formula]. Let ε > 0 be so that |bk - x0| > ε for every k. Let ck = bk - x0. Then the function [formula] is equal to 0 outside of the compact K1 = K - x0, which is also a C-compact, but does not contain the origin. By the definition, the compact K2 = 1 / K1  =  {1 / y:y∈K1} is a C-compact on the plane. Consider [formula]. Since |ck| > ε, still [formula]. But, for every z = 1 / y outside of K2, so that y is outside of K1, H2(z) =  - yH1(y) = 0. Then we apply the case (1).

The operator identity for rational function.

Since the proof of Proposition [\ref=main] is formal, we get using Proposition [\ref=paramrat]:

Let f∈Λd,'. Given [formula], we define l(z) to be the minimal l, such that fl(z) =   ∞  . If there is no such l, then l(z) =   ∞  . We have:

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

Putting in Proposition [\ref=mainrat] λ = 1 and z = vj and combining it with the definition of L(.,.) from Theorem [\ref=onerata], we get:

Let cj, 1  ≤  j  ≤  p, be a summable critical point of f∈Λd,', such that [formula]. Then

[formula]

where

[formula]

Proof of Part (b) of Theorem [\ref=onerat]

By Corollary [\ref=lmtol], it is enough to show that the rank of the matrix [formula] is equal to ν. Now, we follow closely the proof of Theorem 6 of [\cite=mult]. Suppose first we are in the case ∞  . Assume the rank of the matrix [formula] is less than ν. Denote by S the set of indexes j1,...,jν. Then the vectors

[formula]

are linearly dependent: there exist ν numbers aj, j∈S, not all zeros, such that:

[formula]

On the other hand, for every j∈S,

[formula]

where

[formula]

By ([\ref=deprat]), it gives us, that the linear combination [formula] satifies the relation:

[formula]

The function H is reduced to the form

[formula]

and since each cj, j∈S, is summable, the sequences αk, bk satisfy the condition ([\ref=ab1]). Recall the notations [formula], [formula], and the regularization Ĥ of H is:

[formula]

We use the following asymptotics, as z  →    ∞  , which are easily checked (see e.g. the proof of Lemma 8.2 of [\cite=mult]):

[formula]

Now, we can rewrite ([\ref=rl]) as follows:

[formula]

or

[formula]

But the function Ĥ is integrable at infinity, hence, so is Ĥ - TfĤ, and we can write:

[formula]

It implies that IR  →  0 as R  →    ∞  . But then [formula] at infinity. Hence,  ([\ref=h-th]) implies:

[formula]

Since we are in the case ∞  , then b = 0 and vp = 1. Hence, by the second relation of ([\ref=rlm]), L = 0. That is, by ([\ref=rl]), H is a fixed point of Tf. Furthermore, by another condition of the case ∞  , [formula], which, along with L = 0 and the first relation of ([\ref=rlm]), imply that A = 0. Now we use that [formula]. By assertions ([\ref=limsigmaa]), ([\ref=limsigmainf]) of Theorem [\ref=onerata],

[formula]

Thus A = B = 0, hence, the regularization Ĥ of H takes the form:

[formula]

i.e., H is an integrable (on the plane) fixed point of T. By Lemma [\ref=contr] (1), either H(z) = 0 for every z outside of the set K, or f is an exceptional rational function. The latter is excluded, hence, the former holds. By Lemma [\ref=ccomp] and the definition of H, we get that all αk in ([\ref=hformrat]) are zeros. In other words, [formula]. Now we finish the proof as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=one] (b), Subsection [\ref=oneb]. Note that Corollary [\ref=lemravnie] remains true for rational functions (this follows directly from ([\ref=limrata]) and ([\ref=limratinf]) of Theorem [\ref=onerata]). It allows us to repeat the proof of Lemma [\ref=stranno] (with obvious changes) to conclude that all aj, j∈S, are zeros. On the other hand, at least one aj is not zero, which is a contradiction.

Remaining cases are quite similar.

(NN∞). The relations ([\ref=rlm]) hold. Since σ = 1, then the first one gives us L = 0, and since [formula], the second relation gives A = 0. Besides, ([\ref=b]) also holds. Then we apply Lemma [\ref=contr] (2) and end the proof as in the first case.

(ND∞), i.e. σ = 1 and b = 0. Now, assuming the contrary, we get a non-trivial linear combination [formula], such that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

and since the function Ĥ is integrable at infinity, this implies that

[formula]

In the considered case, σ = 1, b = 0, and [formula], hence, by ([\ref=rln3]), Lp - 1 = Lp = 0. Thus H is a fixed point of Tf. We apply Lemma [\ref=contr] (2) and end the proof as in the first case.
