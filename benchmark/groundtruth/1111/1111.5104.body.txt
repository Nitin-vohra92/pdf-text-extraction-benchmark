Subaru constraint on circular polarization in I-band emission from the Magnetar 4U 0142+  61

Based on data collected at Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.

Introduction

Supported by extensive observational studies over the past 10 years, it is generally believed that anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) and soft Gamma-ray repeaters are magnetars--young neutron stars possessing ultra-high magnetic fields of [formula]1014 G (for reviews see, e.g., [\cite=wt06] [\cite=mer08]). The magnetars are remarkable, exhibiting a variety of high-energy phenomena [\citep=kas07] [\citep=mer08], and thus have attracted great attention after their magnetar nature was realized [\citep=td96]. While magnetars are classified as high-energy X-ray sources, it has been learned that they also have relatively strong optical and near-infrared (NIR) emission, and are detectable at the wavelengths as long as they are either close with low extinction or in bright states (i.e., in X-ray outbursts or flares; [\cite=kas07] [\cite=mer11]).

Among over 20 known magnetars (McGill AXP online catalog), the AXP 4U 0142+61 stands out as the best studied magnetar at optical and IR wavelengths due to its relatively short distance (distance d≃3.6 kpc) and low extinction ([formula]; [\cite=dv06a] [\cite=dv06b]). It was the first magnetar discovered with an optical counterpart [\citep=hvk00], and its optical emission was found to be pulsed at its spin period with a pulsed fraction of 27% [\citep=km02], actually higher than that in its X-ray emission (4%-14%; [\cite=gon+10]). Aiming to search for supernova fallback disks around young, isolated neutron stars, [\citet=wck06] discovered mid-infrared (MIR) emission from this magnetar with Spitzer Space Telescope observations, and they showed that its optical and IR spectral energy distribution (SED) can be described by a two-component model: one a power-law spectrum over optical [formula] and NIR J bands probably arising from the magnetosphere of the pulsar, and one thermal blackbody-like over the 2.2-8 μm range arising from a debris disk. Results from follow-up Spitzer MIR spectroscopy and 24 μm imaging of the source were consistent with their model (see Figure [\ref=fig:sed]; [\cite=wck08]). The two-component model remains controversial, as [\citet=dv06c] found that the source's NIR K-band flux can be highly variable with no correlated variability seen in its X-ray emission. In addition optical flux variations were also found by [\citet=dv06c], although not as pronounced as that in K-band.

In order to fully understand optical and IR emission from magnetars, in this paper we report our observational study of another aspect of 4U 0142+61: circular polarization of I-band optical emission from the source. The AXP was observed a few times in 1994-2003, and found to have I = 23.4-24.0 [\citep=dv06c].

Observation and Data Reduction

Circular imaging polarimetry of 4U 0142+61 at I-band was carried out with the 8.2-m Subaru Telescope on 2009 October 24. The imaging instrument used was the Faint Object Camera and Spectrograph (FOCAS; [\cite=kas+02]), which can perform polarimetry with a Wollaston prism and a quarter-wave retarder inserted to the collimated beam. The Wollaston prism splits an incident beam into two orthogonally polarized beams, one ordinary (o-beam) and the other extraordinary (e-beam). The quarter-wave plate converts circular polarized light into linear polarized light by retarding one of the beams by 1/4 of a wave. A standard mask, provided with the FOCAS for imaging polarimetry to avoid blending of the two beams, was used. The detector was two fully-depleted-type 2k×  4k CCDs, with a pixel scale of 0.104arcsec/pixel. The detector was 2×  2 binned in our observation.

Multiple sets of five 5-min exposures of the target field were taken with the quarter-wave plate at position angle (PA) 18 and 108  alternately. Between the sets of the exposures, the telescope was dithered to avoid bad pixels on the CCDs. In total, we took 25 PA=18 and 20 PA=108 exposures. The observing conditions were good, with the seeing (FWHM of point sources) varying between 0.4arcsec-0.8arcsec.

We used the IRAF packages for data reduction. The images were bias subtracted and flat fielded. Dome flats at the two position angles were taken and used for flat fielding respectively. The images made at each PA were then positionally calibrated to a reference image that has the best quality, and were combined into one final image of the target field. For the sets of images at PA=18, a few had the seeing larger than [formula] and were excluded from combining. In our observation, a few ghost sources appeared (see Figure [\ref=fig:fov]). Such ghost sources are produced by the polarizer when a source field contains bright and saturated stars. In our case, two ghost sources were present close to the target in three images of each PA sets. To filter out the two ghost sources, pixels at each pixel position larger than the median of the images by 3 standard deviations were rejected in combining. In addition, for the PA=108 sets, one image with the two ghost sources was not included in combining in order to cleanly remove them. In Figure [\ref=fig:fov], a combined image of the source field is shown. The resulting FWHM of point sources in the two combined images is approximately 0.5arcsec. The total on-source times are 100 min and 95 min for the images at PA=18 and PA=108, respectively.

We used DOPHOT [\citep=sms93], a point-spread function (PSF) fitting photometry program, to measure brightnesses of our target and other in-field stars. The obtained instrumental magnitudes and uncertainties are summarized in Table [\ref=tab:phot]. In addition, aperture corrections were also applied. A large radius of 7.0 pixels (1.46arcsec), which well included all photon counts of a point source, was used for photometry, and the aperture corrections were derived using 5 in-field, relatively bright stars (bright stars in the field were saturated). The uncertainties on the corrections were 0.021-0.035 mag, smaller than those from photometry (0.039-0.048 mag; Table [\ref=tab:phot]).

We performed aperture photometry as an additional check on our results. In order to minimize uncertainties, a small aperture radius of 2.5 pixels (0.52arcsec) was used. Aperture corrections to a radius of 7.0 pixels were also applied. We obtained nearly the same brightness measurements, only with uncertainties generally 0.01 mag larger than those obtained from PSF fitting.

Results

The Stokes V parameter measures the degree of circular polarization, which is derived from

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here Ie and Io are intensities of the target in the e-beam and o-beam frames, respectively. Using the formula and intensity values obtained from PSF-fitting photometry (Table [\ref=tab:phot]), we found V = 1.1%, with an uncertainty of 2.0%. If the aperture corrected intensities are used, the result is nearly the same but with a slightly larger uncertainty, [formula]%. Therefore from our observation, we found a 90%-confidence constraint of |V|  ≤  4.3% on the degree of circular polarization at I-band for 4U 0142+61.

Discussion

Using the 8.2-m Subaru telescope, we have for the first time observationally studied circular polarization in optical emission from the AXP 4U 0142+61. We found that in the source's I-band emission, Stokes V parameter was consistent with being zero, although the uncertainty was relatively large. We note that the interstellar medium can produce polarized light by scattering from aligned, elongated dust grains, but the degree of interstellar circular polarization is on the order of 10- 4 (see, e.g., [\cite=ave+75]), negligible to our case. Considering that the polarimetric observation of the AXP was over 3.3 hours under the good-seeing conditions, it will be difficult to improve our measurement significantly due to the faintness of the source.

Currently, the origin of optical emission from magnetars is not clear. [\citet=egl02] have suggested that their optical emission could be due to synchrotron radiation from electron/positron pairs in ultra-high B  ~  1015 G fields, similar to radio emission from radio pulsars while scaled-up to optical wavelengths. If this is the case, since pulsars' radio emission is seen to be circularly polarized with the degree of polarization (average values over pulse profiles) in a wide range from a few percent to as high as 60% (e.g., [\cite=han+98] [\cite=gl98]), similar polarization would be expected in optical emission from magnetars. Indeed, [\citet=egl02] specifically discussed the polarization detection as a method to verify their model. Our measurement suggests zero circular polarization in I-band emission from 4U 0142+61, not supporting their model. However given the relatively large uncertainty, it is not sufficiently conclusive. We note that the degree of linear polarization of pulsars' radio emission is generally much stronger than that of circular polarization. Even at optical wavelengths, 5 pulsars were studied through linear polarimetry and found to have 5-10% degree of polarization ([\cite=slo+09] and references therein). Linear polarimetry of 4U 0142+61 should thus be conducted. Such an observation can be challenging. In order to conduct linear polarimetry as deep as our circular polarimetry, since imaging at four PAs is required, a significant amount of telescope time with stable, excellent seeing conditions will be needed.

In their hot corona model around magnetars, [\citet=bt07] have suggested two possible mechanisms for optical emission from magnetars: ion cyclotron emission or curvature emission by electron/positron pairs. In the first mechanism, ions in the corona of a magnetar absorb radio and microwave radiation at their cyclotron resonance and re-emit radiation at optical/IR wavelengths. If this mechanism is responsible for optical emission, certain degree of circular polarization might be present, depending on our viewing angle of cyclotron radiation. However it is difficult to estimate the polarization degree, thus not allowing to compare it with our derived upper limit. In the second mechanism, strong linear polarization is expected.

As a summary, we present the first optical circular polarimetry of the AXP 4U 0142+61, the only magnetar that has been well studied at optical and IR wavelengths and is known to have a complicated optical and IR broad-band spectrum. From our observation, a 90%-confidence constraint of |V|  ≤  4.3% in its I-band emission is obtained. Considering the current models proposed to explain optical emission from magnetars, the upper limit is not sufficiently conclusive to discriminate the models. As strong linear polarization in optical emission is expected in the models, deep optical linear polarimetry should be conducted.
