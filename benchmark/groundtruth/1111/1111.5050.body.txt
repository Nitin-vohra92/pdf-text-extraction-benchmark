The exotic Robinson-Schensted correspondence

Introduction

The Robinson-Schensted correspondence is a well-known bijection

[formula]

where Sn denotes the symmetric group, Pn denotes the set of partitions of n, and [formula] denotes the set of standard Young tableaux of shape λ. The resulting partition of Sn into subsets indexed by Pn is the partition into two-sided cells, as defined by Kazhdan and Lusztig [\cite=kl]. These two-sided cells occur in many representation-theoretic contexts: one which is particularly relevant here is the classification of unipotent character sheaves on GLn [\cite=lusztig:charsheaves4].

Steinberg [\cite=st1] [\cite=st2] gave a geometric interpretation of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence, by showing that both sides naturally parametrize the irreducible components of a certain variety Z. This variety can be defined for any connected reductive complex algebraic group G:

[formula]

where G / B is the flag variety, N is the nilpotent cone in [formula], and (G / B)x denotes the Springer fibre [formula]. By considering the irreducible components of Z, Steinberg obtained in [\cite=st1] a bijection

[formula]

where WG is the Weyl group of G, [formula] stands for a set of representatives of the orbits of G in N, Ax is the component group of the stabilizer of x in G, and [formula] is the set of irreducible components of the Springer fibre. When G = GLn, the nilpotent orbits are parametrized by Pn, irreducible components of (G / B)x are parametrized by standard Young tableaux, and Ax is trivial for all x; in this case, Steinberg showed in [\cite=st2] that [\eqref=steinbergeqn] becomes the Robinson-Schensted correspondence [\eqref=rseqn].

Outside type A, the bijection [\eqref=steinbergeqn] lacks some of the crucial combinatorial features of [\eqref=rseqn]. In particular, the resulting partition of WG into subsets indexed by [formula], known as geometric two-sided cells, is not the partition into Kazhdan-Lusztig two-sided cells, and therefore is not directly relevant to the classification of character sheaves of G. See McGovern's paper [\cite=mcgovern] for the geometric two-sided cells in the classical types. Now let V be a 2n-dimensional complex vector space with a fixed nondegenerate skew-symmetric form, and write G = GL(V), K = Sp(V), [formula], [formula]. In [\cite=kato:exotic] [\cite=kato:deformations] Kato has shown that the representation of K on [formula] can be regarded as an 'exotic' version of the adjoint representation of K on [formula], and has somewhat neater combinatorics than the adjoint representation. For example, if [formula] denotes the exotic nilpotent cone (the Hilbert nullcone of [formula]), then K acts on [formula] with connected stabilizers and the orbits are in bijection with the irreducible representations of the Weyl group WK of K.

Kato's results suggest that there should be an interesting theory of exotic character sheaves, which would be K-equivariant simple perverse sheaves on V  ×  G / K. The definition is easy to obtain by modifying Ginzburg's definition of character sheaves on G / K [\cite=ginzburg], bearing in mind the parallel theory of mirabolic character sheaves for GLn due to Finkelberg, Ginzburg, and Travkin [\cite=fg1] [\cite=fg2] [\cite=fgt]. Here we will restrict attention to the unipotent exotic character sheaves. These (or rather their pull-backs to V  ×  G) are the simple perverse constituents of the complexes [formula], where the diagram

[formula]

is defined by q(v,g,g'B) = (v,gg'B,g'B), p(v,g,g'B) = (v,g), and F and G are K-equivariant simple perverse sheaves on V  ×  G / B and G / B respectively. Here q is smooth, p is proper, and both p and q are (K  ×  K)-equivariant, where

K  ×  K acts on V  ×  G by (k1,k2)(v,g) = (k1v,k1gk- 12),

K  ×  K acts on V  ×  G  ×  G / B by (k1,k2)(v,g,g'B) = (k1v,k1gk- 12,k2g'B),

K  ×  K acts on V  ×  G / B  ×  G / B by (k1,k2)(v,gB,g'B) = (k1v,k1gB,k2g'B).

In order to study or classify such unipotent exotic character sheaves along the lines of Grojnowski's study of unipotent character sheaves [\cite=grojnowski], one would first need to find the cells for the action of K  ×  K on V  ×  G / B  ×  G / B. Note that this is the direct product of separate actions of K on V  ×  G / B and on G / B.

The cells for the action of K on G / B are a special case of those defined for any symmetric space G / K by Lusztig and Vogan [\cite=lv], using the action of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of WG on the graded Grothendieck group of K-equivariant perverse sheaves on G / B. In our case, K acts on G / B with connected stabilizers, the orbits are parametrized by the subset R2n  ⊂  S2n consisting of those w such that ww0 is a fixed-point-free involution (where w0 is the longest element of S2n), and the cells were described combinatorially by Garfinkle [\cite=garfinkle]. In fact, she gave a Robinson-Schensted-style bijection

[formula]

where [formula] consists of those partitions of 2n which are duplex, meaning that all parts have even multiplicity. The resulting partition of R2n into subsets indexed by [formula] is the partition into cells, and the bijection [\eqref=garfinkleeqn] has a geometric interpretation similar to Steinberg's interpretation of [\eqref=rseqn]: see [\cite=trapa].

What remains is to analyse the situation when G / B is replaced by V  ×  G / B. The corresponding problem in the context of mirabolic character sheaves was addressed by Travkin [\cite=travkin], who studied the action of GLn on [formula] (where Bn denotes a Borel subgroup of GLn), and the resulting mirabolic Robinson-Schensted correspondence. Our work was inspired by his.

In Section 2, we re-formulate the parametrization of K-orbits in V  ×  G / B, due to Matsuki: they are in bijection with a modification R2n' of the set R2n, defined in Proposition [\ref=orbitprop]. In Section 3, we follow Steinberg's geometric approach to construct a bijection which we call the exotic Robinson-Schensted correspondence:

[formula]

where Q2n' is a set of bipartitions, defined in [\eqref=q2ndef]. The construction of this bijection involves both Kato's exotic nilpotent cone and the enhanced nilpotent cone of [\cite=ah]. In Section 4, we state some conjectures relating this bijection to cells and exotic character sheaves.

K-orbits in V  ×  G / B

Fix a positive integer n. Let V be a 2n-dimensional complex vector space with a fixed nondegenerate skew-symmetric form 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉. Write G = GL(V), K = Sp(V) as in the introduction. Let B be a Borel subgroup of G. We will identify G / B with the variety of complete flags [formula] in V. Given a flag [formula], we obtain another flag [formula] by taking perpendicular subspaces for the form 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉.

It is well known that the G-orbits in G / B  ×  G / B are in bijection with the symmetric group S2n. For w∈S2n, the corresponding orbit OGw consists of pairs of flags [formula] such that

[formula]

It is also well known [\cite=rs] that the K-orbits in G / B are in bijection with the subset

[formula]

For w∈R2n, the orbit Ow consists of flags [formula] such that [formula], or in other words

[formula]

As was shown by Travkin [\cite=travkin], the G-orbits in V  ×  G / B  ×  G / B are in bijection with the set S2n' of pairs (w,α) where w∈S2n and α is a subset of [formula] such that i < j, w- 1(i) < w- 1(j) and j∈α together imply i∈α. (Here we have set α = w(β) where (w,β) is Travkin's parameter.) For (w,α)∈S2n', the orbit OGw,α consists of triples [formula] such that [formula] and

[formula]

The analogous statement in our context was proved by Matsuki:

[\cite=matsuki] The K-orbits in V  ×  G / B are in bijection with the subset R2n' of S2n' consisting of (w,α) for which w∈R2n. For (w,α)∈R2n', the orbit Ow,α consists of pairs [formula] such that [formula].

Note that {0}  ×  G / B is a K-stable subvariety of V  ×  G / B, and is precisely the union of the orbits [formula] for w∈R2n. So the K-orbits in G / B can be thought of as a special case of the K-orbits in V  ×  G / B.

Generalizing a well-known result for the K-action on G / B, we have:

The stabilizer in K of any point of V  ×  G / B is connected.

Matsuki gives a formula [\cite=matsuki] for the number of [formula]-points of such a stabilizer defined over a finite field [formula]. His proof of this formula also shows the connectedness of such a stabilizer over [formula].

Matsuki also gives a formula for the number of orbits:

[\cite=matsuki] With notation as above,

[formula]

A further problem is to describe the closure order on the K-orbits in V  ×  G / B. In [\cite=magyar], Magyar gave a combinatorial definition of a partial order ≤   on S2n' such that for any (w,α),(y,β)∈S2n',

[formula]

(In fact, Magyar used a slightly different parameter set, and effectively excluded the pairs [formula] since he considered G-orbits in [formula].) It is natural to conjecture that for any (w,α),(y,β)∈R2n',

[formula]

The [formula] direction follows immediately from [\eqref=magyareqn]. We will not need [\eqref=poconjeqn] here.

The conormal variety

Continue the notation of the previous section. Let [formula], and let N be the nilpotent cone in [formula]. Let [formula], where [formula] denotes the adjoint of y for the symplectic form, i.e. the endomorphism such that

[formula]

Let [formula] be the K-stable complementary subspace to [formula] in [formula].

It is well known that the cotangent bundle T*(G / B) may be identified with the variety

[formula]

The projection onto the first factor is the cotangent bundle projection, and the projection onto the second factor is the moment map for the action of G on G / B, after we identify [formula] with [formula] using the trace form. Recall that the condition x(Vi)  ⊆  Vi - 1, for 1  ≤  i  ≤  2n, is equivalent to [formula].

We can identify V with V* via the map which sends u∈V to the linear function [formula]. Hence the cotangent bundle T*(V  ×  G / B) may be identified with the variety of quadruples [formula] where v,u∈V and [formula] as above. For v,u∈V, we define [formula] by τv,u(v') = 〈u,v'〉v. This has rank 1 (unless v = 0 or u = 0, in which case τv,u = 0), and every endomorphism of V of rank 1 is of this form.

For (w,α)∈R2n', let Yw,α  ⊂  T*(V  ×  G / B) be the conormal bundle over the orbit Ow,α, and let [formula] be the conormal variety. Since each Yw,α is irreducible of dimension equal to dim (V  ×  G / B) = 2n2 + n, the irreducible components of Y are the closures [formula]. Our aim in this section, following [\cite=st1] and [\cite=travkin], is to find a different parametrization of these irreducible components, and thus construct a bijection between R2n' and the other parameter set.

With the above description of T*(V  ×  G / B), we have

[formula]

If we identify [formula] with [formula] using the trace form, then the natural linear map [formula] becomes the projection [formula]. So the moment map for the action of K on V  ×  G / B is the map [formula] defined by

[formula]

Since Y = μ- 1(0), the result follows.

We let π:Y  →  Z denote the obvious projection where

[formula]

Note that each fibre π- 1(v,u,x) can be identified with the Springer fibre (G / B)x.

Here is a vital fact about the variety Z.

If (v,u,x)∈Z, then

[formula]

The assumption [formula] means that for all v1,v2∈V,

[formula]

Setting v1 = xiv, v2 = xjv in [\eqref=formeqn] gives

[formula]

From this we can deduce by induction on max {i,j} that 〈xiv,xjv〉 = 0 for all i,j  ≥  0 (noting that the i = j case is trivially true). The proof that 〈xiu,xju〉 = 0 is identical. Setting v1 = xiv, v2 = xju in [\eqref=formeqn] then gives

[formula]

If we assume that 〈xiv,u〉 = 0 for all i  ≥  0, [\eqref=2formeqn] allows us to deduce by induction on j that 〈xiv,xju〉 = 0 as required; similarly if we assume that 〈v,xju〉 = 0 for all j  ≥  0. So it suffices to find a contradiction to the assumption that there is some i0 such that 〈xi0v,u〉  ≠  0, and some j0 such that 〈v,xj0u〉  ≠  0. Since x is nilpotent, we can assume that i0 and j0 are maximal with these properties. Then by downward induction on i, we can prove using [\eqref=2formeqn] that 〈xiv,xju〉 = 0 whenever i > i0; similarly, we can prove this whenever j > j0. But then when we set i = i0 and j = j0 in [\eqref=2formeqn], the left-hand side is zero and the right-hand side is nonzero, giving the desired contradiction.

If (v,u,x)∈Z, then [formula].

The assumption [formula] is equivalent to x + τv,u∈S. So we need only show that x + τv,u is nilpotent. Let [formula] be the subspace of V spanned by [formula]. Since W is stable under x, and also contains the image of τv,u, it is stable under x + τv,u, and the endomorphisms of V / W induced by x and by x + τv,u are the same. Since 〈xiv,u〉 = 0 for all i by Proposition [\ref=nilpprop], W is contained in the kernel of τv,u, so the endomorphisms of W induced by x and by x + τv,u are the same. So x + τv,u induces nilpotent endomorphisms of W and of V / W, and is therefore nilpotent.

Recall from [\cite=ah] and [\cite=travkin] that the G-orbits in the enhanced nilpotent cone V  ×  N are in bijection with the set Q2n of bipartitions (μ;ν) of 2n. To say that (μ;ν) is a bipartition of 2n is to say that [formula] and [formula] are partitions (weakly decreasing sequences of nonnegative integers, eventually zero) such that |μ| + |ν| = 2n, where [formula]. For (μ;ν)∈Q2n, the corresponding orbit Oμ;ν  ⊂  V  ×  N consists of those pairs (v,x) such that x has Jordan type [formula] and the endomorphism of [formula] induced by x has Jordan type [formula] (which forces [formula]).

Similarly, by [\cite=kato:exotic] and [\cite=ah], the K-orbits in the exotic nilpotent cone [formula] are in bijection with the set Qn of bipartitions of n. The orbit [formula] is the intersection of [formula] with [formula], where [formula] denotes the duplex partition [formula].

We define

[formula]

In terms of the diagrammatic representation of bipartitions used in [\cite=ah], this condition says that the number of odd-length columns to the left of the wall is the same as the number of odd-length columns to the right of the wall.

If (v,u,x)∈Z, then (v,x)∈Oμ;ν for some (μ;ν)∈Q2n'. We then have [formula] where

[formula]

Certainly we have (v,x)∈Oμ;ν for some (μ;ν)∈Q2n. By Corollary [\ref=nilpcor], we know that [formula] for some [formula]. By definition, this implies that as an element of V  ×  N, (v,x + τv,u) belongs to the orbit [formula]. As seen in the proof of Corollary [\ref=nilpcor], x + τv,u acts on [formula] and [formula] in the same way as x does, so we must have

[formula]

This obviously implies the formulas for [formula] given in the statement. Then from the fact that [formula] for sufficiently large i we deduce that (μ;ν)∈Q2n'.

Note that if v = 0, then [formula] and ν is the duplex partition [formula].

Let [formula] be the map defined in Proposition [\ref=balanceprop]. For fixed [formula], [formula] is the subset of Q2n consisting of all (μ;ν) satisfying [\eqref=balanceeqn]. In the notation of [\cite=ahj], this set is [formula].

Recall from [\cite=ah] the partial order ≤   on Q2n which corresponds to the closure order on orbits in the enhanced nilpotent cone, Namely, (ρ;σ)  ≤  (μ;ν) if and only if the following inequalities hold for all k  ≥  0:

[formula]

As observed in [\cite=ahj], the restriction of this partial order to [formula] is given by

[formula]

Note that [formula] belongs to [formula], and is in general neither a minimal nor a maximal element for this partial order.

For any (μ;ν)∈Q2n', we define

[formula]

Thus Z is the disjoint union of the locally closed subvarieties Zμ;ν. It is not immediately clear that every Zμ;ν is nonempty; this will be shown in Corollary [\ref=dimcor].

For any [formula], define

[formula]

Then by Proposition [\ref=balanceprop] we have

[formula]

For any [formula], we define

[formula]

which is clearly a closed subvariety of [formula].

For any [formula] and [formula], the map

[formula]

is a fibre bundle whose fibres are isomorphic to affine space of some dimension dμ;ν (or else, for the moment, there is the possibility that [formula] is empty).

Fix [formula], and let [formula] (whose dimension is [formula]). Then for u∈V, the condition that y - τv,u is nilpotent is equivalent to the condition that [formula], by Proposition [\ref=nilpprop] and the proof of Corollary [\ref=nilpcor]. If this condition holds, then [formula], so

[formula]

Now the fibre ψ- 1(v,y) can be identified with [formula]. It follows immediately from [\cite=ahj] that for [formula], the condition [formula] is equivalent to

[formula]

Since the matrix coefficients of (y - τv,u)k are affine-linear functions of the coefficients of u, these equations define an affine-linear subspace of [formula] (conceivably empty). As (v,y) ranges over the K-orbit [formula], the fibres ψ- 1(v,y) clearly fit together into a bundle as required.

Zμ;ν is an irreducible variety of dimension

[formula]

(or else, for the moment, there is the possibility that Zμ;ν is empty).

Certainly the orbit [formula] is irreducible. By [\cite=ahs] and [\eqref=balanceeqn],

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=bundleprop], [formula] is an irreducible variety of dimension equal to this plus dμ;ν (or is empty). Since Zμ;ν is an open subvariety of [formula], the result follows.

Now we return to the variety Y. Recall that for any x∈N, the Springer fibre (G / B)x is the variety of flags [formula] such that x(Vi)  ⊆  Vi - 1 for all i. To any such flag we can associate the sequence of partitions which give the Jordan types of [formula]. These can be regarded as a standard tableau of shape λ, where λ∈P2n is the Jordan type of x. In this way, (G / B)x is the disjoint union of locally closed subvarieties (G / B)Tx where T runs over [formula]. As shown by Spaltenstein [\cite=spaltenstein] and Steinberg [\cite=st1], each one of these subvarieties is irreducible of dimension

[formula]

and their closures are exactly the irreducible components of (G / B)x.

Let T2n' be the set of pairs ((μ;ν),T) where (μ;ν)∈Q2n' and [formula]. For any ((μ;ν),T)∈T2n', we define

[formula]

Thus Y is the disjoint union of the locally closed subvarieties YTμ;ν (some of which, for the moment, are conceivably empty).

The main result of this section is:

Each YTμ;ν is nonempty and irreducible of dimension 2n2 + n. Hence the irreducible components of Y are the closures [formula] as ((μ;ν),T) runs over T2n'.

It is clear that π:YTμ;ν  →  Zμ;ν is a fibre bundle whose fibres are isomorphic to (G / B)Tx where x∈N has Jordan type μ  +  ν. By Corollary [\ref=irredcor] and [\eqref=spaltdimeqn], YTμ;ν is an irreducible variety of dimension

[formula]

(or else, for the moment, there is the possibility that YTμ;ν is empty). Hence we can define a map f:T2n'  →  R2n' such that [formula]. Since [formula], f must be surjective. If we can show that |T2n'| = |R2n'|, then it will follow that f is bijective, implying that YTμ;ν is dense in [formula] for all ((μ;ν),T)∈T2n', which gives the result. By Proposition [\ref=numberprop], we are reduced to showing that

[formula]

This follows by taking dimensions of both sides in Proposition [\ref=repprop] below, and using the well-known fact that [formula].

For λ∈P2n, let Vλ denote the irreducible complex representation of S2n labelled by λ (with the usual convention that V(2n) is the trivial representation and V(12n) the sign representation).

We have an isomorphism of representations of S2n,

[formula]

where W(Cn - j) is the subgroup of S2n - 2j centralizing some fixed-point-free involution, δ is the linear character of W(Cn - j) obtained by restricting the sign character of S2n - 2j, and [formula] is a 1-dimensional vector space on which W(Cn - j) acts via δ and Sj  ×  Sj acts trivially.

It is well known that

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the set of duplex partitions of 2n - 2j, i.e. those in which every part has even multiplicity. Using the Pieri rule, it follows that the multiplicity of Vλ in [formula] is the number of ways to successively remove two horizontal strips of size j from the diagram of λ so that what remains has only even-length columns.

Any bipartition (μ;ν)∈Q2n' such that μ  +  ν  =  λ determines such a pair of horizontal strips, as follows. The columns of the diagram of λ are the union of the columns of μ and the columns of ν - for definiteness, say that among columns of the same length, those belonging to μ come after those belonging to ν. The first horizontal strip consists of one box from each column of μ. The second horizontal strip consists of one box from each odd-length column of ν and one box from each (originally) even-length column of μ. By the assumptions on (μ;ν), both strips have size μ1. It is easy to check that every choice of two horizontal strips as above arises in this way for a unique (μ;ν), and the result follows.

As a consequence of Theorem [\ref=irredcompthm], we have:

For every (μ;ν)∈Q2n', Zμ;ν is indeed nonempty, and the quantity dμ;ν in Proposition [\ref=bundleprop] and Corollary [\ref=irredcor] equals |ν|.

Since each YTμ;ν is nonempty, Zμ;ν  =  π(YTμ;ν) is nonempty. Comparing Theorem [\ref=irredcompthm] with [\eqref=dimeqn], we find that

[formula]

Now since (μ;ν)∈Q2n', we have

[formula]

and it follows that [formula].

More importantly, we now have our exotic Robinson-Schensted correspondence:

There is a bijection

[formula]

such that (w,α)∈R2n' corresponds to ((μ;ν),T)∈T2n' if and only if [formula].

This is the bijection f mentioned in the proof of Theorem [\ref=irredcompthm].

An equivalent way to characterize this correspondence is: (w,α)∈R2n' corresponds to ((μ;ν),T)∈T2n' if and only if, for generic [formula], we have (v,x)∈Oμ;ν and [formula].

We do not know a combinatorial description of this correspondence. The method used by Travkin [\cite=travkin] to relate his mirabolic Robinson-Schensted correspondence to the ordinary one does not appear to work in our setting.

Conjectures

Continue the notation of the previous sections. Let PK(V  ×  G / B) be the category of K-equivariant perverse sheaves on V  ×  G / B, and define

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=connectedprop], this is a free [formula]-module with basis {Cw,α  |  (w,α)∈R2n'} where Cw,α is the image in K0(PK(V  ×  G / B)) of the intersection cohomology complex of [formula] (shifted so as to be perverse). Define MG(G / B  ×  G / B) similarly.

There is a well-known convolution product on MG(G / B  ×  G / B) which makes it isomorphic to the Iwahori-Hecke algebra H2n of S2n. A similar convolution construction makes MK(V  ×  G / B) into an H2n-module. This is a direct generalization of the H2n-module MK(G / B) defined by Lusztig and Vogan [\cite=lv] (indeed, MK(G / B) occurs in MK(V  ×  G / B) as the [formula]-submodule spanned by [formula] for w∈R2n). By analogy with [\cite=lv] and [\cite=travkin], we are led to the following conjecture. A reference for the W-graph terminology used here is [\cite=gpf].

The basis {Cw,α} of the H2n-module MK(V  ×  G / B) is a W-graph basis.

If (w,α) corresponds to ((μ;ν),T) under the exotic Robinson-Schensted correspondence, the label of Cw,α in the W-graph is the descent set [formula].

If (w,α) corresponds to ((μ;ν),T) and (y,β) corresponds to ((ρ;σ),U), then [formula] in the W-graph preorder if and only if (μ;ν)  ≥  (ρ;σ) and (ν;μ)  ≥  (σ;ρ). In particular, (w,α) and (y,β) lie in the same cell if and only if (μ;ν) = (ρ;σ). Hence the cells are indexed by Q2n'.

For (μ;ν)∈Q2n', the corresponding cell module is the irreducible H2n-module labelled by the partition μ  +  ν. Hence the representation of S2n on MK(V  ×  G / B)|v = 1 is isomorphic to those mentioned in Proposition [\ref=repprop].

It is straightforward to verify Conjecture [\ref=mainconj] in the cases n = 1 and n = 2.

We return now to the setting of the introduction, and the proposed classification of unipotent exotic character sheaves. Imitating the arguments of [\cite=grojnowski], one can assign to each unipotent exotic character sheaf a pair (c1,c2) where c1 is a cell for the action of K on V  ×  G / B and c2 is a cell for the action of K on G / B, with the property that the two-sided cell in S2n associated to c1 is the same as that for c2. If Conjecture [\ref=mainconj] holds, then such pairs (c1,c2) are in bijection with pairs [formula] with the property that μ  +  ν  =  λ, or in other words with (μ;ν)∈Q2n such that μ  +  ν is duplex. These in turn are in bijection with Qn via the map [formula], and of course Qn parametrizes the irreducible representations of WK = W(Cn) as in [\cite=gpf]. Hence we would have a map from the set of isomorphism classes of unipotent exotic character sheaves to the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible representations of WK. It seems plausible that this map is a bijection, as with ordinary character sheaves for GLn (but in contrast to the situation of ordinary character sheaves for K). If true, this would be another respect in which the exotic picture has neater combinatorics than the usual picture for the symplectic group.
