The Poincaré Homology Sphere and Almost-Simple Knots in Lens Spaces

Beginning with the standard genus 1 Heegaard diagram for the lens space L(p,q) with p > q > 0 where an α curve and a β curve intersect p times, there are just two simple isotopies of these curves that produce a genus one Heegaard diagram with p + 2 intersection points. Figure [\ref=fig:heegaardtwist] adds two basepoints to a local view of each of the standard diagram (center) and the two isotoped diagrams (left and right) to form doubly pointed Heegaard diagrams for knots in the lens space. The center knot is the simple knot K(p,q,q + 1) in the language and notation of [\cite=rasmussen]. (Such a knot is called grid number one in [\cite=bgh].) The knots to the left and right are Hedden's knots TL and TR [\cite=hedden]. The knots TL and TR are each homologous to K(p,q,q + 1) since they each differ from K(p,q,q + 1) by a crossing change as demonstrated in Figure [\ref=fig:3d!]. Due to their knot Floer homologies being as close to that of the simple knots without actually being so, we refer to these two knots as almost-simple.

Rasmussen shows that exactly when K(p,q,q + 1) is the dual to a Berge knot of type VII (i.e. when [formula]) does TL admit an integral Dehn surgery producing an integral homology sphere that is also an L-space [\cite=rasmussen]. He states that he determined the surgered manifolds for these TL in lens spaces as large as L(39,16) to actually be the Poincaré homology sphere P3 by checking their fundamental groups. That all these TL that are homologous to duals of Berge knots of type VII indeed do admit Poincaré homology sphere surgeries is then one part of Greene's Conjecture 1.9 [\cite=greene]. Here we provide a short proof.

If TL is homologous to the dual to a Berge knot of type VII, then it admits an integral surgery producing the Poincaré homology sphere.

Let J be the positive (left-handed) trefoil, and let F0 and Fπ be two of its fibers. Then [formula] is a genus 2 Heegaard splitting of S3. Now consider an essential simple closed curve in F0 as a knot K embedded in F0 in S3. Then K is immediately a doubly primitive knot ([\cite=berge-lens]) with respect to this Heegaard splitting . The knots in S3 that embed as essential curves on the once-punctured torus fiber of the positive trefoil and their mirrors are the Berge knots of type VII [\cite=berge-lens].

One may show the surface framing that F0 induces on K has positive integral slope. Dehn surgery along this slope then yields a lens space L(p,q) and the knot K' = K(p,q,q + 1) dual to K. The surgery on K then causes a surgery of F0 along K, rendering it a disk D0 that K' intersects twice. Indeed [formula] is a Heegaard torus for the lens space L(p,q), and, due to the doubly primitive presentation of K, K' is an unknotted arc in the solid torus to on each side. Notice that in L(p,q), after surgery on K, the positive trefoil J is now the boundary of this disk: [formula]. Therefore + 1 surgery on J in L(p,q) simply inserts a full left-handed twist in K'. We will conclude that this twist transforms K' into TL, though for now let us call the resulting knot T'.

The Poincaré homology sphere P3 may be obtained as + 1 surgery on J in S3. Let us first do this surgery, regard K  ⊂  F0 as a knot in P3, and then do F0-framed surgery on K. Because we are only swapping the order in which surgery is done on the link [formula], this must also produce the lens space L(p,q) in which the knot dual to K  ⊂  P3 is the above knot T', i.e. K' with that full left-handed twist. In particular, we conclude that T'  ⊂  L(p,q) is a 1-bridge knot with respect to the Heegaard torus [formula], is in the homology class of a knot dual to a Berge knot of type VII, and admits an integral Poincaré homology sphere surgery.

Because the Poincaré sphere P3 is both an L-space and an integral homology sphere, [\cite=rasmussen] implies that since T' is a knot in the lens space L(p,q) representing a primitive homology class (that of K' = K(p,q,q + 1)) and admitting an integral surgery to P3, then ((L(p,q),T))  ≤  p + 2. Because T' is 1-bridge but generically not the simple knot K(p,q,q + 1) (otherwise T' = K(p,q,q + 1) is actually dual to the trefoil J, the only knot in S3 with an integral surgery to P3 [\cite=ghiggini]), we must have that T' = TL by [\cite=hedden].

If one were to pay more attention to the meridional disks for handlebodies to either side of [formula] that are disjoint from K, one could directly see that the twist on J in L(p,q) takes K' = K(p,q,q + 1) to TL without appealing to the knot Floer homology argument in the last paragraph of the proof above. Indeed, J is the loop in the local picture of Heegaard torus in the center of Figure [\ref=fig:heegaardtwist] that encircles the two basepoints. Figure [\ref=fig:3d!] then illustrates that TL is obtained from K(p,q,q + 1) by a full Dehn twist on this curve.

The manifolds, Heegaard splittings, knots, and fibers in the proof above all behave well with respect to certain involutions. Let us therefore recast that proof in terms of bandings of between a two-bridge link [formula] and each an unknot [formula] and the ( - 3,5)-torus knot p̂. We omit details of the correspondences.

Let A be the braid axis of the closure [formula] of the 3-braid σ1σ2. The positive trefoil J may be viewed as the lift to S3 of A in the double cover of S3 branched over the unknot [formula]. A disk D bounded by A that intersects [formula] three times lifts to a once-punctured torus fiber F of J. Any essential simple closed curve on F is then isotopic on F to a curve that is the lift of some simple arc k on D connecting two of the three points of [formula]. We may simplify the presentation of this arc with a 3-braid conjugation. The top-left of Figure [\ref=fig:tangle] shows this setup where γ is the conjugating 3-braid. Banding together the unknot [formula] along k with the framing bestowed upon it by D, we obtain a two-bridge link [formula] and a dual arc k' as shown in the top-middle and top-right of Figure [\ref=fig:tangle]. Observe that A bounds a disk that intersects each [formula] and k' just once.

Performing + 1 / 2-Dehn surgery along A before the banding takes the closed 3-braid [formula] to p̂, the closure of the 3-braid σ1σ2(σ1σ2)- 6  =  (σ1σ2)- 5, as in the lower-left of Figure [\ref=fig:tangle]. The closed braid p̂ is the ( - 3,5)-torus knot and its double branched cover is P3. (The pretzel knot P(2, - 3, - 5) is isotopic to the ( - 3,5)-torus knot, see Figure [\ref=fig:isotopy].) Doing this surgery on A after the banding does not change [formula], but does cause a' to wrap around [formula] twice near [formula] giving an arc t' as in the lower-right of Figure [\ref=fig:tangle]. Minding framings, a banding of the two-bridge link [formula] along this arc t' produces the ( - 3,5)-torus knot p̂.
