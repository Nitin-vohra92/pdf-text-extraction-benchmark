Discriminating between the von Neumann and Lüders reduction rule

Introduction

In his ground-breaking book [\cite=vN] of 1932, von Neumann investigated the quantum mechanical measurement problem and formulated a rule how to obtain the state of an ensemble of physical systems after a measurement. This rule was later substantially modified by Lüders [\cite=L]. It is the Lüders reduction or projection rule that nowadays is mostly used. The Lüders rule states that after a selective measurement [\cite=selective] of an observable Â with discrete eigenvalues the subensemble of systems with the measurement result ai is in the (non-normalized, pure) state P̂i|ψ〉, where P̂i is the (possibly multi-dimensional) projection operator onto the eigenspace of the eigenvalue ai and where |ψ〉 the state prior to the measurement. For an initial density matrix [formula] one obtains P̂iP̂i [\cite=remark].

The von Neumann reduction rule assumes that in the case of degeneracy one measures a refinement Â' of Â, which commutes with Â and which has only non-degenerate discrete eigenvalues [\cite=vN] and thus lifts the degeneracy. Usually this results from consecutive measurements (for examples cf. e.g. [\cite=Rafa] and Eq. ([\ref=basis2]) of the Appendix below). Then Â is a function of Â', Â  =  f(Â'), say, and from a measurement result a' of Â' for an individual system one obtains the corresponding result a = f(a') for Â. As a generalization we introduce here the notion of a partial von Neumann type measurement which can also arise from consecutive measurements (cf. Appendix). One can choose a refinement which lifts the degeneracy of Â only partially. Then still Â  =  f(Â'), but Â' may have some degenerate eigenvalues. Then a partial von Neumann type measurement is obtained by performing a Lüders type measurement of this observable Â'. There are recent and important investigations of the state after more general measurements [\cite=Beltrametti] [\cite=recent], but we restrict ourselves to the above reduction rules.

In this paper we propose a simple three-step procedure, based on selective measurements, to test whether one deals with a Lüders type measurement of an observable Â or not. We illustrate this for a particular measurement result, a1 say. After the measurement the subensemble of systems with the result a1 is selected and denoted by E1. Then a refinement of Â, denoted by σ̂, with discrete non-degenerate eigenvalues, is measured for each system of E1. Then on E1 one again measures Â by means of the unknown apparatus and then again σ̂. If for any system of E1 the result of the second measurement of σ̂ differs from the first, one does not have a Lüders type measurement. If the results are the same for each system one chooses another, particular, refinement σ̂' of Â with non-degenerate eigenvalues and which does not commute with σ̂ (i.e. only with Â). Then one proceeds as before, with σ̂' instead of σ̂. But now it turns out that one has a Lüders type measurement (on E1) if and only if for each system the two results of the σ̂' measurements are the same.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section [\ref=two] we show how the procedure works in the simple case of an observable with twofold degeneracy. In Section [\ref=n] the general case is treated. In Section [\ref=disc] the results are discussed. In the Appendix we give examples of Lüders, von Neumann, and partial von Neumann type measurements.

Testing the twofold degenerate case

For greater transparency the procedure will first be explained for the example of the Appendix with two spins, Â  =  σ1z  +  σ2z. The eigenvalue a1  =  0 of Â is twofold degenerate. An as yet unknown apparatus performs a measurement of Â on an ensemble E. The apparatus can be assumed to perform a measurement of an observable Â', which is a possible trivial or nontrivial refinement of Â. We say that Â' is associated to the apparatus.

We assume that the result a1  =  0 is found on a subensemble E1 of systems. In the two-dimensional eigenspace of the eigenvalue a1 of Â the as yet unknown observable Â', which commutes with Â, either has two non-degenerate eigenvalues or a single twofold degenerate eigenvalue. In the former case the apparatus performs a von Neumann measurement and in the latter a Lüders measurement.

Now we choose a refinement σ̂ of Â with non-degenerate eigenvalues. As an example, we take it to be diagonal in the basis | +  + 〉, | +  - 〉, | -  + 〉, and | -  - 〉, e.g.

[formula]

In the two-dimensional eigenspace of Â for a1 the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of σ̂ are s1 = 1 with |s1〉  =  | +  - 〉 and s2 =  - 1 with |s2〉  =  | -  + 〉. It may happen that, inadvertently and at this stage unknown to us, the chosen σ̂ and the unknown operator Â' associated with the apparatus are jointly diagonal and commuting. This will bring a complication and will later require an additional step in the procedure. Now we proceed as follows.

(i) First a measurement of σ̂ is performed on the subensemble E1. Since σ̂ has only non-degenerate eigenvalues there is no difference between a von Neumann and a Lüders measurement of σ̂ and the possible results are s1 and s2. If s1 is found the subensemble of corresponding systems in E1 is denoted by E11, and after this measurement it is in the pure state |s1〉. Similarly for s2.

(ii) Now one lets the apparatus measure Â on the systems of E1. Of course, the value found is again a1 for each system. If the apparatus performs a Lüders measurement the state |si〉 of subensemble E1i is definitely not changed, while for a von Neumann measurement a change of the state |si〉 may or may not occur.

(iii) After this one again measures σ̂ on E1. If one finds both s1 and s2 for systems in E11, then the state |s1〉 has been changed and one concludes that the apparatus performs a von Neumann measurement. Similarly for E12.

If, on the other hand, one finds only s1 on E11 this means that one of the projection operators in the decomposition of Â' leaves |s1〉 invariant and that |s1〉 is an eigenvector of Â'. But then the orthogonal vector |s2〉 is also an eigenvector of Â'. Thus Â' and σ̂ are diagonal in the same basis and commute. To find out if the above unknown projection operator of Â' is two-dimensional or not one now chooses another operator, σ̂' say, which does not commute with σ̂, e.g.

[formula]

The relevant eigenvalues are s1' = 4 and s2' = 0 with eigenvectors |s1,2'〉  =  |φ+ , -〉 from Eq. ([\ref=vN1]), and they are not orthogonal to |s1〉, with 〈s1|s1,2'〉  ≠  0. Now one proceeds as before for σ̂. One first measures σ̂' on the systems of E11, which is in the state |s1〉, and denotes by E11' the subensemble of systems for which the value s1' has been found. Then, on E11', which is in the state |s1'〉, one lets the apparatus perform a measurement of Â. This measurement again yields the value a1, but it may or may not have changed the state of E11', depending on whether the apparatus performs a von Neumann or Lüders measurement. Then again σ̂' is measured on E11'. If both s1' and s2' appear as measurement results the state has been changed and therefore the apparatus performs a von Neumann measurement. If only the value s1' appears then |s1'〉 is an eigenstate of Â', as is |s1〉, from the above argument. From the non-orthogonality of |s1〉 and |s1'〉 it follows that the corresponding eigenspace of Â' is two-dimensional. Hence in this case the apparatus performs a Lüders measurement.

The general test

In this section we describe the test procedure for Lüders vs. von Neumann for a general observable Â with discrete, possibly degenerate, eigenvalues ak. Corresponding orthogonal eigenvectors are denoted by |aαk〉, [formula] so that the degeneracy is nk. Then

[formula]

where P̂k is the projection operator onto the eigenspace of ak. According to the Lüders rule the subensemble with the measurement result ak is described by

[formula]

in case of a pure initial state |ψ〉, and by

[formula]

in case of a mixed initial state [formula]. Both the norm squared and the trace give the probability of finding the value ak. The complete ensemble is, directly after the measurement, described by the normalized density matrix

[formula]

Now consider a refinement Â' of Â which partially lifts the degeneracy of Â. Then Â' is of the form

[formula]

where the orthogonal projection operators [formula], are partial sums of |aαk〉〈aαk| for fixed k. Then Â is a function of Â', Â = f(Â'), and f(akβ') = ak. A partial von Neumann measurement of Â is obtained by a Lüders measurement of Â' where the apparatus is so programmed that its output is f(akβ') instead of akβ'. After the measurement the subensemble for which the output is f(akβ') = ak is described instead of by Eq.([\ref=Li]) by the density matrix

[formula]

and the complete ensemble by their sum over k. Note that if mk = 1 for all k, i.e. [formula], then one has a Lüders measurement, and if all P̂βk are one-dimensional projection operators one has a usual (i.e. not a partial) von Neumann measurement.

We now describe the test procedure Lüders vs. von Neumann for the general case and consider an ensemble E of systems with initial density matrix [formula]. As before we denote by Â' the observable associated to the unknown apparatus and consider the subensemble E1 of systems for which an eigenvalue a1 of Â has been found as the measurement result. The eigenvalue is n1 fold degenerate. The subensemble E1 is described by the density matrix 1, with

[formula]

where the P̂βk are the unknown projection operators on eigenspaces of Â'.

Let σ̂ be an observable commuting with Â and with discrete non-degenerate eigenvalues. The previous steps can now be adapted as follows.

(i) First one measures σ̂ on the systems of E1. The eigenvalues of σ̂ in the a1 eigenspace are denoted by [formula], with eigenstates |si〉. The subensemble of systems for which the result si is found in the measurement will be denoted by E1i. It can be described by the pure state |si〉.

(ii) Now one lets the apparatus perform a measurement of Â on the systems of E1. The result is of course again a1 and after the measurement the density matrix of the subensemble E1i is proportional to

[formula]

If m1 = 1, i.e. if the apparatus performs a Lüders measurement in the a1 eigenspace, this is the pure state |si〉〈si|. Otherwise it is a mixed state.

(iii) After this, one again measures σ̂ on E1. If for a system of a subensemble E1i this second measurement of σ̂ gives a result different from si one concludes from step (ii) that the apparatus has changed the state |si〉 and thus has not performed a Lüders measurement, but rather a (possibly partial) von Neumann measurement.

If, however, the result is always si for each E1i then E1i remains in its state |si〉 after the measurement of Â by the apparatus and hence this state is an eigenvector of Â'. (If all si appear as measurement results this implies that Â' and σ̂ happen to commute on the a1 eigenspace.)

In this case one chooses an additional observable σ̂', with non-degenerate eigenvalues and which commutes with Â but not with σ̂ and which has the following special property. In the a1 eigenspace the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of σ̂' are denoted by si' and |si'〉. The latter are connected to the eigenvectors |sj〉 of σ̂ by a unitary transformation, and one chooses σ̂' in such a way that one has

[formula]

where s1 is assumed to have occurred as a result in the measurement of σ̂. Such a σ̂' can always be found, and Eq. ([\ref=s']) is the key to distinguishing both types of measurements. On the systems of the subensemble E11 (which in this case has remained in the state |s1〉) one then performs, with σ̂ replaced by σ̂', the steps (i)-(iii) . Since the transition probability |〈s1|sj'〉|2  =  |γj|2  ≠  0, all eigenvalues si' appear as measurement results in the first measurement of σ̂', and the associated subensembles E1i' are in the state |si'〉. Then, as the second step, one lets the apparatus perform a measurement of Â. In the third step σ̂' is measured again on the systems of the subensemble E11. If for any system of E11 the result of the second measurement of σ̂' differs from the first then the state has been changed by the apparatus and one has a (possibly partial) von Neumann measurement.

Otherwise, if for all systems of E11 the result of the second measurement of σ̂' is the same as in the first, then the states |si'〉 are not changed and hence are eigenvectors of Â', as is |s1〉. Then all vectors in Eq. ([\ref=s']) are eigenvectors of Â'. But this can only happen if they belong to the same eigenvalue since |s1〉 is not orthogonal to any |si'〉. This implies that the a1 eigenspace of Â is also an eigenspace of Â' and hence the apparatus performs a Lüders measurement of a1 if for each system of the subensemble E11 the results of the first and second measurement of σ̂' are the same.

Discussion

In this paper the two forms of the reduction rule due to von Neumann and Lüders, also known as the projection postulate, have been discussed. The original formulation of von Neumann starts with an observable with discrete, possibly degenerate, eigenvalues, but then goes over to a refinement with non-degenerate eigenvalues, thus lifting the degeneracy. The projection operators are then one-dimensional and project onto the individual non-degenerate eigenvectors. Lüders, on the other hand, does not lift the degeneracy but uses projections onto eigenspaces of the original observable. The dimension of these eigenspaces are given by the degeneracy of the observable under consideration. In this paper we have also introduced an additional, sort of intermediary, reduction rule for which a refinement of the observable is used which lifts the degeneracy only partially and which may retain some degeneracy. We call the associated measurement a partial von Neumann measurement.

It has been shown here that all three forms of the reduction rule may appear quite naturally, depending on the realization of a particular measurement apparatus. Therefore all three forms have their own legitimacy, and one can not say that one is better than the other. Their applicability depends on the circumstances, i.e. the details of the measurement apparatus.

The main investigation of this paper focused on the following question. If a measurement apparatus for an observable is only known to obey one of the forms of the reduction rule of von Neumann and Lüders, but otherwise the details of the apparatus are not known how can one check whether the reduction has occurred by the Lüders rule or not? To this end we have proposed and studied a three-step procedure based on measurements of an auxiliary observable. The outcome of the latter measurements indicates the type of reduction.

It would be interesting if one could carry this investigation over to the more general types of measurements characterized in Ref. [\cite=Beltrametti].

Examples for different measurement schemes

We consider an ensemble consisting of systems, each with two independent spins, [formula] and [formula], with [formula] the Pauli matrices. For the z component of the total spin, σtot,z  =  σ1z  +  σ2z the possible measurement results are 2, 0, 0, -2, with corresponding eigenvectors | +  + 〉, | +  - 〉, | -  + 〉, and | -  - 〉.

Now, in case of a Lüders type measurement, if the initial state of the ensemble is a pure state |ψ〉 then after the measurement the respective subensembles are given by the pure states P̂i|ψ〉, i = 1, ~ 0, ~  - 1. Here

[formula]

where [formula]. The total ensemble is then described after this measurement by a density matrix given by [formula]. Similarly for an initial density matrix instead of a pure state.

Following von Neumann, instead of σtot,z one can measure a refinement of σtot,z with non-degenerate eigenvalues, e.g. the observable [formula], which lifts the degeneracy of σtot,z. From this one obtains an indirect measurement of σtot,z as follows. The eigenvectors of Â' are

[formula]

with respective eigenvalues a' = 6, 4, 2 and 0. If one defines the function [formula] then f(6) = 2, f(4) = 0, f(2) =  - 2 and f(0) = 0, and f(Â')  =  σtot,z. This is either checked directly by insertion of Â' or by applying f(Â') to the eigenvectors of Â'. Therefore, if the result of an Â' measurement on a system is a', then one knows that σtot,z has the values f(a'). In contrast to the previous Lüders measurement, now the subensemble with the result 0 for σtot,z is in a mixed state, given by the density matrix

[formula]

The complete ensemble has now the density matrix

[formula]

For consecutive measurements von Neumann type measurements appear quite naturally. If the two spins are spatially sufficiently separated one can measure them individually, e.g. first a Lüders measurement of σ1z and then immediately afterwards of σ2z [\cite=Rafa]. This also provides a measurement of σtot,z. In this case, the possible individual measurement results are +  + , ~  +  - , ~  -  + , ~  -  - , and after the measurement the corresponding subensembles are obviously in the states | +  + 〉, [formula], | -  - 〉. If the initial state of the ensemble is a pure state |ψ〉 then after the measurement its state is given by the density matrix

[formula]

and similarly for an initial density matrix. It is apparent that this consecutive measurement amounts to a particular von Neumann measurement, but with a resulting density matrix which differs from the previous one in Eq. ([\ref=basis1]). The measurement is equivalent to a separate measurement of the projection operators P̂|ij〉 or, equivalently, of an observable of the form [formula] with pairwise different a'ij's. This observable Â' can be taken to be associated with the apparatus measuring the individual spins separately.

We now consider an ensemble consisting of systems each with three independent spins, [formula], [formula], and [formula], and the observable Â  =  σ1z  +  σ2z. One can now consecutively measure σ1z and σ2z, as before. Then with three independent spins, this gives a partial von Neumann measurement of σ1z  +  σ2z. If one measured all three spins consecutively this would resolve the degeneracy and lead to an ordinary von Neumann measurement.
