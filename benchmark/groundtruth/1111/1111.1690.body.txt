Introduction

We denote by [formula] the d-dimensional Euclidean space and by [formula] integer lattice in it. d(  ·  ,  ·  ) denotes the standard Euclidean metric and B(x,r) is the ball of radius r around x, with respect to that metric. We also denote by μs(  ·  ) the s-dimensional Lebesgue measure in [formula].

A subset [formula] is a separated net if it is uniformly discrete and relatively dense. That is, there exist constants r,R > 0 such that for any y1,y2∈Y we have d(y1,y2)  ≥  r, and for every [formula] we have d(x,Y)  ≤  R. We say that Y1 is a bounded displacement (BD) of Y2 if there is a constant α and a bijection φ:Y1  →  α  ·  Y2 such that [formula].

This paper deals with the following question:

Given a separated net [formula], is there a BD between Y and [formula]?

The motivation for this question comes originally from a related question that was asked by Gromov: Is every separated net [formula] biLipschitz equivalent to [formula]? This question was answered negatively (for d > 1) by Burago and Kleiner in [\cite=BK98], and independently by McMullen in [\cite=McM98]. When considering separated nets, BD equivalence implies biLipschitz equivalence, and this implies that there exists separated net in [formula] which are not BD of [formula]. In the context of the above questions, it is equivalent to consider tilings of [formula] with finitely many tiles, up to isometry. Obviously, a tiling τ of [formula] gives rise to separated nets Yτ by placing a point in each tile (up to BD). On the other hand, a separated net defines a tiling of [formula] by taking the Voronoi cells. A similar argument gives a tiling with finitely many tiles: Divide the plane to small enough dyadic cubes Q. For every y∈Y assign the tile

[formula]

Denote this tiling by τY, then it is easy to see that any separated net YτY is a BD of Y. We restrict ourselves to a subset of tilings - substitution tilings (see §[\ref=Definitions]). In this context, Theorem [\ref=Goal] answers Question [\ref=main_question] almost completely. Substitution tilings has a corresponding matrix, the substitution matrix, which we denote by AH (see Definition [\ref=SubMatrix+Primitive]). We denote by [formula] the eigenvalues of AH, with a descending order in absolute value. These parameters play an important role in our main results, and in the previous related results.

Question [\ref=main_question] was previously studied in the context of substitution tilings in [\cite=S11] and [\cite=ACG11]. It was shown in [\cite=S11] that any primitive substitution tiling, with a matrix AH of Pisot type, gives rise to a separated net which is a BD of [formula]. Recently Aliste-Prieto, Coronel and Gambaudo have improved this result. They showed that the same holds if [formula], see [\cite=ACG11] (note that λ1 > 1). Our main goal is to prove Theorem [\ref=Goal], which extends the results of [\cite=S11] and [\cite=ACG11] to a wider class, and gives the tight inequality on the eigenvalues for when BD to [formula] exists.

We denote by Wλ the eigenspace that corresponds to λ, by [formula] the subspace which is orthogonal to W with respect to the standard inner product 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉, and let [formula].

For a primitive substitution tiling of [formula], fix t  ≥  2 to be the minimal index that satisfies [formula]. Then the corresponding separated net Y satisfies the following:

If [formula] then Y is not a BD of [formula].

If [formula] then Y is a BD of [formula].

If [formula] and λt has a non-trivial Jordan block, then Y is not a BD of [formula]. Moreover, there are cases where the same consequence holds, and λt has a trivial Jordan block.

Note that t = 2 for almost every matrix AH.

It is follows from the proof of (II) that if there is no t as above, namely [formula] for every t  ≠  1, then Y is a BD of [formula].

In the case of equality [formula], we do not know if there is an example in which Y is a BD of [formula].

The proof of the theorem rely on the following result of Laczkovich:

For a separated net [formula] and β > 0 the following statements are equivalent:

There is a constant C such that for any measurable set [formula] we have

[formula]

There is a constant C such that for every finite union of unit lattice cubes U we have

[formula]

There is a BD [formula].

The organization of this paper is as follows: In section §[\ref=Definitions] we recall the relevant definitions and a few results on substitution tilings. In §[\ref=Economic_Packing_for_Patches] we get a series of estimates that are needed for the proof of Theorem [\ref=Goal]. Among them, we prove an isoperimetric lemma, and then use it to generalize a result of Laczkovich. In §[\ref=Proofs_Main_Theorems] we prove Theorem [\ref=Goal], and examples for the different cases this Theorem are given in §[\ref=Examples].

Preliminaries

A set [formula] is a tile if it is biLipschitz homeomorphic to a closed d-dimensional ball. Note that this requirement implies in particular that a tile's boundary has a well defined d - 1-dimensional volume. A tiling of a set [formula] is a countable collection of tiles, with pairwise disjoint interiors, such that their union is equal to U. A tiling P of a bounded set [formula] is called a patch. We call the set U the support of P and we denote it by supp(P). Given a collection of tiles F, we denote by F* the set of all patches by the elements of F. For further reading on tiling see for instance [\cite=GS87].

Substitution Tilings

Let ξ > 1 and let [formula] be a set of d-dimensional tiles.

A substitution is a mapping H:F  →  ξ- 1F* such that supp(Ti) = supp(H(Ti)) for every i. Namely, it is a set of dissection rules that shows us how to divide the tiles to other tiles from F with a smaller scale. We also allow to apply H to finite or infinite collections of tiles. The constant ξ is called the inflation constant of H.

Let H be a substitution defined on F. Consider the following set of patches:

[formula]

The substitution tiling space XH is the set of all tilings of [formula] that for every patch P in them there is a patch P'∈P such that P is a sub-patch of P'. Every tiling τ∈XH is called a substitution tiling of H.

Consider the following equivalence relation on tiles: Ti  ~  Tj if there exists an isometry O such that Ti = O(Tj) and H(Ti) = O(H(Tj)). We call the representatives of the equivalence classes basic tiles, and denote them by [formula]. By this definition, we can also think of H as a dissection rule on the basic tiles and extend it to collections of tiles as before. For a tile T in the tiling we say that T is of type i if it is equivalent to Ti.

Matrices of Substitution

Let [formula] be the set of basic tiles. Define the substitution matrix of H to be an n  ×  n matrix, AH = (aij), where aij is the number of basic tiles in ξH(Tj) which are of type i. We say that H is primitive if AH is primitive. That is, if there exists an [formula] such that AmH > 0.

Denote by ei the i'th element of the standard basis of [formula]. We use vectors to represent the number of basic tiles from each type in a given patch. For instance, ei represents one tile of type i. Then AH(ei) is the i'th column of AH. Thus, multiplying the vector ei by AH gives a vector that represents the number of basic tiles of each type obtained after applying H on Ti. By linearity, this idea extends to any vector in [formula].

Notations and Previous Results

A substitution tiling has many parameters that we need throughout the proofs. For the convenience of the reader we assemble all the notations regarding the parameters of the tiling here.

Our given tiling is denoted by τ or τ0, and we fix a separated net Y that correspond to τ. The basic tiles are [formula], and [formula] denotes their d-dimensional volume. H is the substitution, which is always assumed to be primitive, and ξ > 1 is the inflation constant. We denote by [formula] the eigenvalues of AH in a descending order in absolute value. It is easy to see that λ1  =  ξd > 1. It also follows from the Perron Frobenius Theorem that λ1 is of multiplicity one, and it has positive eigenvector v1 (see § 3 in [\cite=S11] for details). We fix a Jordan basis of AH and denote by vi the i'th vector in it (vi corresponds to λi), and by vi(j) its j'th coordinate. Without loss of generality v1(1) = 1. Denote by [formula], then it is easy to see that u1 is the left eigenvector of AH that corresponds to λ1. Finally, we fix

[formula]

This α is the asymptotic density of Y.

If H is a primitive substitution then [formula] and for every τ∈XH and for every [formula] there exists a tiling τm∈XH that satisfies (ξH)m(τm) = τ.

See [\cite=Ro04].

Given a tiling τ  =  τ0∈XH, for every m we fix a tiling τm as in Proposition [\ref=tau_m_Def]. [formula] denotes the set of all tiles of τm, and [formula]. The set of all finite unions of tiles of τ0 is denoted by [formula].

We prove Theorem [\ref=Goal] using Theorem [\ref=Laczkovich_Thm]. To use it we need to estimate the discrepancy [formula] for different sets U. Note that for every patch [formula] we have

[formula]

where [formula], and aj is the number of tiles of τ0 from type j in V. Then the discrepancy of V depend only on aV, and is given by the absolute value of the following linear functional:

[formula]

Let t  ≥  2 be the minimal index such that [formula]. Then there are constants A1,A2 > 0, depending only on the parameters of the tiling, with the following properties:

There exists a [formula] such that for every m and [formula] of type j

[formula]

For every [formula]

[formula]

where kt is the size of the maximal Jordan block of λt in AH.

Let [formula] and write [formula]. Note that disc(v1) = 0, and also 〈u1,vi〉 = 0 for every i  ≠  1. So we have

[formula]

But, if T in τm is of type j then aT = AmHej. Write [formula], then

[formula]

So for every i, ci = bi  ·  Const  ·  mki - 1  ·  λmi. Considering ([\ref=disc(a_T)]), this proves (ii). For (i), if vt has a Jordan block of size kt, let [formula] the last vector in the corresponding Jordan chain. Note that there exists a j with [formula] in the presentations [formula]. Using ([\ref=disc(a_T)]) in the same way again, we showed (i).

By ([\ref=disc(a_T)]), if t as above does not exist, then the lemma holds with λt = 0.

Economic Packing for Patches

We denote by ∂A and int(A) the boundary and interior of a set [formula] (in the standard topology of [formula]), and by [formula] the standard [formula] norm on [formula].

In this section we prove a series of lemmas that help us estimate the terms that appears in Theorem [\ref=Laczkovich_Thm]. Our main objective of this section is to prove Proposition [\ref=Lemma_3.2_tiles] below. This Proposition gives a very good bound for the number of tiles from each level that one needs in order to obtain a given patch in a substitution tiling. Laczkovich proved this Proposition for the lattice unit cube tiling in [\cite=L92], and here we give a proof for the more general case by generalizing his arguments to our context. Proposition [\ref=Lemma_3.2_tiles] is the key point for the proof of Theorem [\ref=Goal] in §[\ref=Proofs_Main_Theorems].

For every d there is a constant C1 such that for every [formula], a finite union of lattice unit cubes, and every R > 0, we have

[formula]

This is a direct consequence of Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2 of [\cite=L92].

There is a constant C2, that depends on the parameters of the tiling, such that for any [formula]

[formula]

Denote by Qr the d-dimensional cube with edge of length r. Fix a biLipschitz homeomorphism ψi:Ti  →  Q1, denote its biLipschitz constant by Ki, and let K =  max i{Ki}. Let [formula] and suppose that [formula], a tile of type i. Then by rescaling the picture by ξm we get a biLipschitz homeomorphism φ:T  →  Qξm, with the same biLipschitz constant. Since φ is biLipschitz, it follows that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Applying the same argument to the tiles which are adjacent to T we obtain

[formula]

It also follows that

[formula]

(see Theorem 1 in [\cite=EG92] p.75). Then by ([\ref=1_tube_of_the_boundary_estimate]), ([\ref=Boundary_of_tile_vs._Boundary_of_cube]), and Lemma [\ref=Laczkovich_2.1+2.2] we have

[formula]

[formula]

We use the same notations [formula], and [formula] as defined at the end of §[\ref=Definitions].

Let [formula], and [formula]. Then there is an ε > 0 such that for any [formula], with [formula], we have

[formula]

This Lemma follows from the relative isoperimetric inequality, see [\cite=EG92] p.190. By this inequality, if B is a closed ball, and E  ⊆  B is a closed set of finite perimeter (i.e. χE has a bounded variation) then we have

[formula]

where C depends only on d. Fix a biLipschitz homeomorphism ψi:Ti  →  B(0,1), denote its biLipschitz constant by Ki, and let K =  max i{Ki}. Suppose that T is a tile of type i, then by rescaling the picture by ξm we get a biLipschitz homeomorphism φ:T  →  B = B(0,ξm), with the same biLipschitz constant. Since φ is biLipschitz, it follows that

[formula]

(see [\cite=EG92] p.75). Considering ([\ref=relative_isoperimetric_for_ball]) with E = φ(V) we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

Setting s =  min i{si} and Dmax  =   max i{μd - 1(∂Ti)} we get

[formula]

that satisfies the assertion, and does not depend on the type of the tile T.

Let [formula], [formula], and ε as in ([\ref=Epsilon]). Suppose that [formula] with μd(V)  ≤  (1 - c)  ·  μd(T) and [formula], then [formula].

Assume otherwise, then we have [formula] and [formula], contradicting Lemma [\ref=Isoperimetric].

For a T in τm we denote by T* the unique tile of τm + 1 that contains T. We denote [formula], then for any tile [formula] we have

[formula]

For a set [formula] we denote by S(X) the closure of X under the operations of disjoint union and proper difference, where every element of X can be used only once. For the following lemma we set ε as in Lemma [\ref=Isoperimetric] and define the following constants:

[formula]

Let

[formula]

Then there exists [formula], Ti  ⊆  T for all i, such that [formula], and for every m we have:

[formula]

The proof is by induction on m, where [formula]. If m = 0 then [formula] implies that [formula], so the assertion is obvious. Assume the assertion for any [formula] with m < m0, and let V and T be as in ([\ref=Lemma_assumptions]) with [formula]. Consider the following collection of tiles:

[formula]

where ε is as in Lemma [\ref=Isoperimetric] and c is as in ([\ref=The_constants]) (it might be that [formula]). Note that every [formula] satifies:

[formula]

Then by Corollary [\ref=Laczkovich_Lemma_3.1] we have

[formula]

Let [formula] be the maximal elements of [formula] (w.r.t. inclusion). Then [formula], and [formula] has pairwise disjoint interiors. Denote [formula]. Then

[formula]

Note that if [formula] we only get ≤   in the middle inequality, but then the last inequality is strict. Thus [formula], and in particular [formula] for every j. By ([\ref=P_minus_V_estimation]), we may apply the induction hypothesis for [formula] and the tile Pj, to obtain tiles [formula] such that Tjr  ⊆  Pj, [formula], and for every m we have:

[formula]

Now let [formula] be the maximal tiles that are contained in V1. Then [formula] has pairwise disjoint interiors and their union is equal to V1. So we can write

[formula]

where the sets [formula] are pairwise disjoint. This implies that

[formula]

Fix [formula] and denote [formula], and [formula]. It remains to show that

[formula]

We first estimate [formula]. Fix an i∈E. Since Ti is maximal in V1, if follows that [formula]. In particular, by the definition of V1, since the Pj's are maximal in [formula], we have [formula]. by ([\ref=V_1_is_strictly_contained_in_T]), [formula], then [formula], and therefore T*i  ⊆  T. Our next goal is to show that

[formula]

If [formula] then Ti  ⊆  V, and therefore

[formula]

Otherwise, int(Ti) intersect int(Pj) for some j. Then either [formula] or Pj  ⊆  Ti. If [formula] then T*i  ⊆  Pj  ⊆  V1, a contradiction. Then Pj  ⊆  Ti whenever [formula]. Denote by J the set of indices j such that Pj  ⊆  Ti, then we have

[formula]

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Thus ([\ref=T^*_estimate]) holds. Since T*i  ⊆  T and [formula], it follows form ([\ref=T^*_estimate]) and from the definition of [formula] that [formula] because it satisfies

[formula]

Let [formula]. Since the Ti's are distinct elements of [formula], and by ([\ref=T_vs._T^*]), each point of K is covered by at most ρ  ·  ξd  T*i's. Therefore, by ([\ref=T_i^*capV_boundary]), we have

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Now define

[formula]

If j∈J1 and r∈Ej then Tjr  ⊆  T*i for some i. Since T*i contains at most ρ  ·  ξd tiles of [formula] we have

[formula]

If j∈J2 and i∈E then [formula] (since [formula]). Then the set [formula] is disjoint from K. By ([\ref=By_the_induc_for_P_j]) we have [formula], and hence

[formula]

The sets K and [formula] are disjoint, and their union is a subset of [formula], hence

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Thus ([\ref=goal_of_3.2]) holds and the proof is complete.

Proof of the Main Theorems

Proof of (I): We show that if [formula] then (i) of Theorem [\ref=Laczkovich_Thm] does not hold for any α. Fix a [formula] such that ([\ref=Improved_Lemma_lower_bound]) holds for any tile of type j, and consider the sequence of measurable sets T(m), the m'th inflation of Tj. Then by Lemma [\ref=Distance_1_from_boundary_estimate] we have

[formula]

Recall that ξd  =  λ1, then we have

[formula]

As we did in the proof of Lemma ([\ref=Discrepancy_Estimate]), for any α different than the one defined in ([\ref=alpha]) disc(v1)  ≠  0, and so disc(aT) = Const  ·  λm1. For large m's, this is obviously greater than any constant times [formula]. For α as in ([\ref=alpha]), by Lemma [\ref=Discrepancy_Estimate] we have

[formula]

which by assumption is greater than [formula], for any constant and for a large enough m's. Considering ([\ref=d-1-dim_vol]), we proved that (i) of Theorem [\ref=Laczkovich_Thm] does not hold.

Proof of (II): We show that (ii) of Theorem [\ref=Laczkovich_Thm] holds, where α is as in ([\ref=alpha]). Let [formula], where diam(A) denote the diameter of a set A. It is sufficient to show that (ii) holds for any U, a finite union of R-cubes (cubes with edge length R and corners at [formula]). Let U be a finite union of R-cubes. For every y∈Y we denote by Ty the tile of τ0 that corresponds to y, and define an [formula] by [formula]. Then [formula]. Note that [formula], so it follows from Lemma [\ref=Laczkovich_2.1+2.2] that

[formula]

Since [formula] we have

[formula]

So it is enough to estimate [formula].

Next we claim that [formula]. Indeed, if x∈∂V then either x∈U or x∉U. If x∈U, since x∈∂V, x∈∂Ty for some y∉U, and therefore d(x,∂U)  ≤  d(x,y)  ≤  diam(Ty)  ≤  R. A similar argument holds if x∉U since x also belong to ∂Ty for some y∈U. Therefore, every tile T of τ0 with [formula] is contained in [formula]. Denote by [formula]. Then by Lemma [\ref=Laczkovich_2.1+2.2] we have

[formula]

To finish the proof, we apply Proposition [\ref=Lemma_3.2_tiles] to V. We pick a large enough [formula] such that ([\ref=Lemma_assumptions]) holds. By Proposition [\ref=Lemma_3.2_tiles] we obtain [formula] such that [formula], and for every m we have:

[formula]

Note that if [formula] and [formula] then

[formula]

and similarly if B  ⊆  A then

[formula]

Therefore, since [formula], we have

[formula]

[formula]

By the assumption, [formula], and therefore the series converges and we have

[formula]

Considering ([\ref=discrepancy_V_vs._discrepancy_U]) and ([\ref=partial(V)_vs._partial(U)]), we have shown (ii) of Theorem [\ref=Laczkovich_Thm], which implies the assertion.

Proof of (III): Under the assumption of kt > 1, using ([\ref=Improved_Lemma_lower_bound]) in the same way as in the proof of (I) shows the assertion. For the case where the Jordan block of λt is trivial, we give an example in [formula], where the corresponding separated net is not a BD of [formula]. Example: Consider the substitution rule H that is defined by this picture:

[formula]

So we have [formula], and λ2 = 4 = λ(d - 1) / d1. Denote by T(m)i,i = 1,2 a tile of type i in [formula]. For every [formula] we define a patch [formula] in the following process:

Take a tile Tm + 12 and remove from it the (unique) T(m)1 that it contains.

From what is left U(1)1, remove all the T(m - 1)1 with at least two faces common with ∂U(1)1.

Eventually, from U(m - 1)1 remove all the T(1)1 with at least two faces common with ∂U(m - 1)1, to get U(m)1. Define Vm = U(m)1.

[formula]

So obviously

[formula]

We fix an m and estimate [formula]. For that we consider the following partition of Vm to tiles from different levels [formula]'s:

[formula]

For i = 1,2 and [formula] let [formula]. By the construction,

[formula]

Recall that the discrepancy of Vm depends only on the vector [formula] (see ([\ref=a_V])). We can write it now in terms of the t2,k's. Calculations of AkHe2 shows that:

[formula]

Note that α = 3 / 4 (see ([\ref=alpha])), then

[formula]

Observe that ([\ref=Example_boundary_estimate]) and ([\ref=Example_disc_calculation]) together shows that (ii) of Theorem [\ref=Laczkovich_Thm] does not hold, which implies that any tiling in XH correspond to a separated net which is not a BD of [formula].

Examples

In this last section we give some examples for primitive substitution tilings to show that the different cases that appears in Theorem [\ref=Goal] exists. In all of the examples below we give the substitution H and refer the result to any separated net that corresponds to any substitution tiling in XH. Note that in all the examples below the order of the tiles does not matter, but only how many we have of each type. We add the drawings of the substitution rule in order to show that there are substitutions that correspond to the matrices.

[formula]

[formula]. The eigenvalues are: 9,4,1, - 1, and we have 4 > 91 / 2. But the eigenvector that corresponds to 4 is in [formula], then λt = 1 < 91 / 2, and therefore any tiling in XH give rise to a separated net which is a BD of [formula].

[formula]

[formula]. The eigenvalues are: 9,3,3,2, where 3 has a non-trivial Jordan block, and the generalized eigenvector is not in [formula]. Here, by Remark [\ref=Remarks_on_the_main_Thm], any separated net that correspond to a tiling in XH is not a BD of [formula].

[formula]

[formula]. The eigenvalues are: 9,5,3,2, and we have 5 > 91 / 2. But the eigenvector that corresponds to 5 is in [formula], then λt = 3 = 91 / 2. Then we have here an example for a substitution that we don't know to say whether the corresponding separated nets are a BD of [formula] or not.
