Convexity and a sum-product type estimate

Applications to sum-product estimates

By choosing f(x) =  log x and applying Theorems [\ref=theorem:main] and [\ref=theorem:main2], some interesting sum-product type results can be specified, especially in the case when the productset is small. A sum-product estimate is a bound on max {|A + A|,|A  ·  A|}, and it is conjectured that at least one of these sets should grow to a near maximal size. Solymosi ([\cite=solymosi]) proved that [formula], and this is the current best known bound. See [\cite=solymosi] and the references contained therein for more details on this problem and its history.

In a similar spirit, one may conjecture that at least one of |A - A| and |A  ·  A| must be large, and indeed this is somewhat true. In an earlier paper of Solymosi ([\cite=solymosi2]) on sum-product estimates, it was proved that

[formula]

It is easy to change the proof slightly in order to replace |A + A| with |A - A| in the above, however, in Solymosi's subsequent paper on sum-product estimates, this was not the case. So, [formula] represents the current best known bound of this type. Applying Theorem [\ref=theorem:main] with f(x) =  log x, and noting that |f(A) + f(A)| = |A  ·  A|, we get the following very marginal improvement.

[formula]

In particular, this implies that

[formula]

By applying Theorem [\ref=theorem:main2] in the same way, we establish that

[formula]

In the case when the product set is small, then ([\ref=differenceproduct]) and ([\ref=sumproduct]) show that the sumset and difference set grow non-trivially. This was shown in [\cite=Liconvex], and here we get a more explicit version of the same result.
