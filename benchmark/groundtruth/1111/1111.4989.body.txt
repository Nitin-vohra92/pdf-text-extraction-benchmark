Introduction

A coloring of a graph G is a labeling [formula]; a k-coloring is a labeling φ:V(G)  →  [k], where [formula]. A coloring of the vertices of a graph G is distinguishing if no nontrivial automorphism of G preserves all of the vertex colors; such a coloring distinguishes G. In 1996 Albertson and Collins [\cite=AC] introduced the distinguishing number D(G) of a graph G, defined to be the minimum number of colors in a distinguishing coloring of G. Since its introduction, the distinguishing number and related parameters have received considerable attention in the literature (see for example [\cite=BogCow_Cube] [\cite=Bout_DetCartProd] [\cite=FI] [\cite=KlWZhu_JAlg] [\cite=KlZhu_CartPow]). In 2006 Collins and Trenk [\cite=CT] introduced the distinguishing chromatic number χD(G) of a graph G, defined to be the minimum number of colors in a distinguishing coloring of G that is also a proper coloring. Subsequent investigation of the distinguishing chromatic number (for instance, [\cite=BhattLal_ChromDistPete] [\cite=ChHartKaul_ChromPow] [\cite=JerKlav_DistChromPow] [\cite=LaFSey_DistBip]) has focused on similarities and disparities between the distinguishing chromatic number and one or both of the distinguishing number and the chromatic number.

One of the most studied variants of the chromatic number is the list chromatic number, introduced independently by Vizing in 1976 [\cite=Vizing] and Erd, Rubin, and Taylor in 1979 [\cite=ERT]. Recently Ferrara, Flesch, and Gethner [\cite=FFG] extended the notion of a distinguishing coloring to that of a list distinguishing coloring. Given an assignment L = {L(v)}v∈V(G) of lists of available colors to the vertices of G, we say that G is L-distinguishable if there is a distinguishing coloring f of G such that f(v)∈L(v) for all v. The list distinguishing number of G, [formula], is the minimum integer k such that G is L-distinguishable for any list assignment L with |L(v)| = k for all v. The existence of a graph G for which D(G) and [formula] are not equal remains a major open question.

While not explicitly introduced in [\cite=FFG], it is natural to consider a list analogue of the distinguishing chromatic number. We say that G is properly L-distinguishable if there is a distinguishing coloring f of G chosen from the lists such that f is also a proper coloring of G. The list distinguishing chromatic number [formula] of G is the minimum integer k such that G is properly L-distinguishable for any assignment L of lists with |L(v)|  ≥  k for all v.

In this paper, we study these four distinguishing parameters for trees, showing that [formula], [formula], and χD(T)  ≤  D(T) + 1 for any tree T. In our proofs, we extend an enumerative technique first introduced by Cheng to determine the distinguishing number of trees [\cite=ChengTree]. The technique has subsequently been used to determine the distinguishing number of both planar graphs [\cite=ChengPlanar] and interval graphs [\cite=ChengInterval].

Preliminaries

A vertex v is in the center of a tree T if v minimizes [formula]. In the majority of the paper, we will be considering rooted trees. A rooted tree is a tree with an identified vertex called the root. Given vertices u and v in a rooted tree T with root r, v is the parent of u if v is the neighbor of u in the unique u,r-path in T, and u in this case is a child of v. Two vertices with the same parent are siblings. More generally, v is an ancestor of u if v lies anywhere in the unique u,r-path, and in this case u is a descendant of v. Given a vertex v in a rooted tree T, we let Tv denote the subtree of T rooted at v that is induced by v and all of its descendants. All automorphisms of a rooted tree stabilize the root.

Two colorings φ1 and φ2 of rooted trees Tv1 and Tv2 are equivalent if there exists an isomorphism π:V(Tv1)  →  V(Tv2) that maps v1 to v2 and that maps the coloring φ1 to φ2: that is, for every vertex u∈V(Tv1), we have φ1(u) = φ2(π(u)).

Distinguishing Colorings

The main result of this section is the following.

If T is a tree, then [formula].

To prove Theorem [\ref=theorem:tree_dist], we shall prove [formula] for any rooted tree T'; this suffices since the following lemma provides a reduction from unrooted trees to rooted trees.

For any tree T, there is a rooted tree T' with D(T)  =  D(T') and [formula].

In [\cite=J], Jordan proved that the center of a tree T is either a single vertex or an edge, and in either case the center of T is set-wise stabilized by all automorphisms. If the center of T is a single vertex, then let T' be T rooted at the center and note that [formula].

If the center of T is the edge e, then let T' be obtained by subdividing e and rooting the resulting tree at the unique vertex in T' - T, which is the center of T'. In [\cite=ChengTree], Cheng showed that D(T)  =  D(T'), and it is straightforward to show by a nearly identical argument that [formula] as well.

The following observation describes a simple condition that is necessary and sufficient for a coloring to distinguish a rooted tree.

Let T be a rooted tree. For a fixed x∈V(T), partition the children of x into classes [formula] so that two vertices u,v are in the same class if and only if [formula]. A coloring φ distinguishes Tx if and only if

Following the notation from [\cite=ChengTree], we let D(G;k) denote the number of equivalence classes of distinguishing k-colorings of a graph G. Cheng showed that D(Tx;k) can be computed recursively.

Let Tx be a tree with root x and partition the children of x into classes [formula] so that two vertices u,v are in Cj if and only if [formula]. Select a representative uj for each class Cj. The number of equivalence classes of distinguishing k-colorings of Tx is given by

[formula]

For a list assignment L = {L(v)}v∈V(G), we let D(G;L) be the number of equivalence classes of distinguishing L-colorings of G.

If Tx is a rooted tree and L = {L(v)}v∈V(Tx) is a list assignment with |L(v)|  =  k for all v∈V(Tx), then D(Tx;L)  ≥  D(Tx;k). Equality holds if and only if D(Tx;L) = 0 or L(u)  =  L(v) whenever u and v lie in the same orbit of Tx.

Observe first that if D(Tx;k)  =  0, then the conclusion holds trivially. For any vertex v∈T, let Lv denote the restriction of L to the vertices in Tv. We proceed by induction to show that D(Tv;Lv)  ≥  D(Tv;k) for each subtree Tv of Tx. If v is a leaf, then D(Tv,Lv) = D(Tv;k) = k.

Assume that v is not a leaf of Tx. Partition the children of v into classes [formula] as in Observation [\ref=obs:distinguishsiblings], and label the vertices in class Cj as [formula] where mj  =  |Cj|. By induction, D(Tvj,p;Lvj,p)  ≥  D(Tvj,p;k) for all p∈[mj]. Set dj  =  D(Tvj,1;k); it follows that dj  =  D(Tvj,p;k) for all p∈[mj] since the subtrees in Tvj,p are isomorphic.

For p∈[mj], let Sj,p be a set of representative colorings from each equivalence class of distinguishing Lvj,p-colorings of Tvj,p; note that |Sj,p| = D(Tvj,p;Lvj,p), and by induction, |Sj,p|  ≥  dj. Let Rj be the set of tuples [formula] such that φj,p and φj,q are inequivalent when p  ≠  q. By Observation [\ref=obs:distinguishsiblings], an Lv-coloring φ distinguishes Tv if and only if, for every class Cj, the tuple [formula] of colorings induced on Tvj,p is component-wise equivalent to an element of Rj. Let rj be the number of equivalence classes in Rj, where two tuples are equivalent if they are the same up to the order of the coordinates. A maximum set of inequivalent Lv-colorings of Tv is formed by independently selecting one tuple [formula] from each equivalence class of Rj for each class Cj and selecting any color for v from L(v). Hence, [formula].

We bound rj by selecting colorings [formula] for the subtrees [formula] in order. By induction, for p∈[mj], there are at least dj  -  p  +  1 choices for φj,p in Sj,p that are inequivalent to the previous selections for [formula]. Thus, there are at least [formula] ways to select mj inequivalent colorings [formula]. Each equivalence class in Rj is counted at most mj! times, so

[formula]

Therefore by Lemma [\ref=lemma:chengrecursion],

[formula]

If D(Tx;L) = 0, then it is clear that D(Tx;L) = D(Tx;k). Otherwise we show that equality holds if and only if L(u) = L(v) when u and v lie in the same orbit of Tx. We prove this by induction on the number of vertices in Tx. Let L be a list assignment such that D(Tx;L) > 0 and D(Tx;L) = D(Tx;k). The result holds trivially if Tx has a single vertex.

Let [formula] be the partition of the children of x as above. Equality holds for Tx if and only if [formula] for all j∈[t]. Furthermore, [formula] if and only if |Sj,p| = dj for all p∈[mj] and every coloring in Sj,p has an equivalent coloring in Sj,q for all p,q∈[mj]. By induction, |Sj,p| = dj if and only if L(y) = L(w) when y and w lie in the same orbit of Tvj,p.

Consider a vertex y in Tvj,p. By permuting colors on the orbit O containing y, each color in L(y) appears in O in a distinguishing L-coloring φj,p in Sj,p. The isomorphism σ:V(Tvj,p)  →  V(Tvj,q) guaranteed by an equivalent pair [formula] satisfies φj,p(y)  =  φj,q(σ(y)) for all y∈V(Tvj,p). Therefore, each color in L(y) also appears in the lists of the vertices in the orbit of σ(y) in Tvj,q, and consequently L(y)  =  L(σ(y)). Each vertex in the orbit of y in Tx that is not in Tvj,p lies in the image of O under some such isomorphism σ. Thus, every vertex in the orbit of y in Tx has the same list of colors as y. Consequently, if equality holds, then L(u) = L(v) whenever u and v lie in the same orbit of Tx.

Conversely, if L(u) = L(v) whenever u and v lie in the same orbit of Tx, then L(y) = L(w) when y and w lie in the same orbit of Tvj,p. Furthermore, each coloring Sj,p has an equivalent coloring in Sj,q for all p,q∈[mj].

Note that D(T) is the minimum k so that D(T;k) is positive. Similarly, [formula] is the minimum k so that D(T;L) is positive for every list assignment L with |L(v)|  =  k. By considering the list assignment that gives the same k colors to every vertex, it is clear that [formula] is positive only if D(T) is. Thus, the following corollary is immediate from Theorem [\ref=theorem:list_dist_count].

If T is a rooted tree, then [formula].

Theorem [\ref=theorem:tree_dist] follows from Lemma [\ref=lma:rootedunrooted] and Corollary [\ref=cor:rootedlistequality].

List Distinguishing Chromatic Number

In this section, we prove that the distinguishing chromatic number of a tree is equal to the list distinguishing chromatic number using a similar enumerative method.

If T is a tree, then [formula].

For x∈V(T), let Dχ(Tx;k) denote the number of equivalence classes of distinguishing proper k-colorings of the rooted tree Tx. For i∈[k], let Dχ(Tx;k,i) denote the number of equivalence classes of distinguishing proper k-colorings of Tx in which x gets color i. Note that [formula] for all i∈[k]. Hence Dχ(Tx;k) = kDχ(Tx;k,1).

Similarly, let Dχ(Tx;L) denote the number of equivalence classes of distinguishing proper L-colorings of the rooted tree Tx. For i∈L(x), let Dχ(Tx;L,i) be the number of equivalence classes of distinguishing proper L-colorings of Tx in which x gets color i. Here, the value Dχ(Tx;L,i) may change for different values of i∈L(x). Thus [formula].

As we discuss below, consideration of rooted trees is sufficient to demonstrate [formula] in most, but not all unrooted cases. The next result is analogous to Theorem [\ref=theorem:list_dist_count].

If Tx is a rooted tree and L  =  {L(v)}v∈V(Tx) is a list assignment with |L(v)|  =  k for all v∈V(Tx), then Dχ(Tx;L,i)  ≥  Dχ(Tx;k,1) for all i∈L(x). Equality holds for all i∈L(x) if and only if k  ≥  2 and all lists in L are identical.

Similar to the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:list_dist_count], we show that Dχ(Tv;Lv,i)  ≥  Dχ(Tv;k,1) for all v∈V(Tx) and i∈L(v) inductively. If v is a leaf, then Dχ(Tv;Lv,i)  =  Dχ(Tv;k,1)  =  1.

Assume that v is not a leaf. Partition the children of v into equivalence classes [formula] by isomorphism classes of subtrees. Label the vertices in each class Cj as [formula] where mj  =  |Cj|. The following claim is analogous to Lemma [\ref=lemma:chengrecursion].

For i∈[k], [formula].

By Observation [\ref=obs:distinguishsiblings], a proper k-coloring φ such that φ(v) = i distinguishes Tv if and only if the colorings φvj,p, obtained by restricting φ to the trees Tvj,p for vj,p∈Cj, are inequivalent distinguishing proper k-colorings with φvj,p(vj,p)  ≠  i. Hence, there are (k - 1)Dχ(Tvj,1;k,1) possible colorings for Tvj,1. Since [formula] for all p∈[mj], there are (k - 1)Dχ(Tvj,1;k,1) possible colorings of Tvj,p. We choose |Cj| of these colorings to place on the trees Tvj,p for vj,p∈Cj. Since Dχ(Tv;k,i) counts colorings up to isomorphism, the selection of these colorings is independent of their order in Cj. Also, the choices of these colorings are independent among the different isomorphism classes {Cj}tj = 1, so Dχ(Tv;k,i) is given by the product [formula], proving the claim.

Let dij  =  (k - 1)Dχ(Tvj,1;k,1). By induction,

[formula]

We now consider the number of equivalence classes of distinguishing proper Lvj,p-colorings of Tvj,p in which vj,p does not get color i. Let Sij,p be a set of representative colorings from each such equivalence class. Let Rij be the set of tuples [formula] such that φj,p and φj,q are inequivalent when p  ≠  q. By induction,

[formula]

By Observation [\ref=obs:distinguishsiblings], a proper Lv-coloring distinguishes Tv if and only if, for every class Cj, the colorings φj,p induced on Tvj,p form a tuple [formula]. Let rij be the number of equivalence classes in Rij, where two tuples are equivalent if they are the same up to the order of the coordinates. Form a maximum set of inequivalent proper Lv-colorings φ in which v gets color i by independently selecting one tuple [formula] from each equivalence class of Rij for each class Cj. Hence, [formula].

We bound rij by selecting colorings [formula] for subtrees in order. For p∈[mj], there are at least dij - p + 1 selections for φj,p from Sj,p that are inequivalent to the selections of [formula]. Thus, there are at least [formula] possible ways to select mj inequivalent colorings [formula]. Each equivalence class in Rij is counted at most mj! times, so

[formula]

Therefore, by Claim [\ref=claim:chicount],

[formula]

Consider the partition of the children of x as in Observation [\ref=obs:distinguishsiblings]. Equality holds for all colors in L(x) if and only if, given an arbitrary i∈L(x), [formula] for all for all j∈[t]; this holds if and only if |Sij,p|  =  dij  =  (k - 1)Dχ(Tvj,1;k;1) for all p∈[mj]. Noting that (k - 1)Dχ(Tvj,1;k;1) = (k - 1)Dχ(Tvj,p;k;1), equality holds if and only if Dχ(Tvj,p;k;1) = Dχ(Tvj,p;L;i') for all [formula]. Because there are multiple choices of i∈L(x), it follows that equality holds for all colors in L(x) if and only if Dχ(Tvj,p;k;1) = Dχ(Tvj,p;L;i') for all i'∈L(vj,p). Thus, by induction, the lists are identical in Tvj,p. Furthermore, [formula] for all j∈[t] if and only if color i appears in the list L(vj,p) for all p∈[mj]. This is true for all i∈L(x), so x and all of its children have the same list.

If Tx is a rooted tree, then χD(Tx) is the minimum k so that Dχ(Tx;k,1) > 0, and [formula] is the minimum k so that for every assignment L of lists of size k, there exists an i∈L(x) such that Dχ(Tx;L,i) is positive. By considering the list assignment in which every vertex gets the list

[formula]

Distinguishing Chromatic Number

In this section, we show that the distinguishing chromatic number and the distinguishing number of a tree differ by at most one and the bound is sharp. We also describe when these parameters are different.

If Tx is a rooted tree, then χD(Tx)  ≤  D(Tx)  +  1.

Let [formula] be a distinguishing k-coloring of Tx. We create a distinguishing proper (k + 1)-coloring [formula] starting at the root: let φ'(x)  =  φ(x). Proceed recursively; after coloring a vertex v, consider a child u of v. If φ'(v)  =  φ(u), then let φ'(u)  =    *  . Otherwise, let φ'(u)  =  φ(u). Hence, a vertex u receives color *   if and only if its parent v has φ(v)  =  φ(u) and the previous step assigned φ'(v)  =  φ(v). Therefore, φ' is a proper coloring. Also note that if x and y are siblings with φ'(x)  =  φ'(y), then φ(x)  =  φ(y). Since any nontrivial automorphism of Tx interchanges subtrees rooted at siblings, any φ'-preserving automorphism is also a φ-preserving automorphism. Therefore φ' is distinguishing if φ is distinguishing.

It follows from Lemmas [\ref=lma:rootedunrooted], [\ref=lemma:chiunrooted], and [\ref=lemma:chiunrooted2] that χD(T)  ≤  D(T)  +  1 for unrooted trees as well.

We now characterize the trees for which χD(T)  =  D(T)  +  1. Again we let T' be the rooted tree obtained by rooting T at its center if the center is unique, or rooting at the vertex obtained by subdividing the central edge of T.

If T is a tree with D(T) = k, then χD(T)  =  k  +  1 if and only if

If D(T) = 1 and T has more than one vertex, then clearly χD(T) = 2. Thus we may assume that D(T)  ≥  2, and we only consider graphs satisfying χD(T)  ≥  3. By Lemmas [\ref=lma:rootedunrooted] and [\ref=lemma:chiunrooted], it suffices to consider the rooted tree T'.

By Claim [\ref=claim:chicount], the number of proper distinguishing k-colorings of the rooted tree T'x is given by [formula]. There exists no proper distinguishing k-coloring of T' if and only if this product is zero. This product is zero if and only if (k - 1)Dχ(T'vj;k,1)  <  |Cj| for some j. If (k - 1)Dχ(T'vj;k,1)  <  |Cj| for some j, then letting S = Cj suffices. Conversely, if the set S exists, then S  ⊆  Cj for some j. If vj is an element of S, then (k - 1)Dχ(T'vj;k,1)  <  S  ≤  |Cj|, and there is no proper distinguishing k-coloring of T'.

We conclude this section by noting that Cheng's algorithm for computing D(T) can be adapted to compute χD(T) by replacing the counting method in Lemma [\ref=lemma:chengrecursion] with Claim [\ref=claim:chicount]. This leads to a polynomial time algorithm to determine if χD(T)  =  D(T) and if not, it can produce the certificate (v,S) from Theorem [\ref=thm:certificate].
