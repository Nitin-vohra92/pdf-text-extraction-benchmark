Transitivity and topological mixing for C1 diffeomorphisms

To Steve Smale, for his influence on differentiable dynamics.

Introduction

In his seminal dissertation about differentiable dynamical systems [\cite=smale-dynamics], Smale described the recurrence of hyperbolic diffeomorphisms:

Recall that the restriction of f to an invariant compact set Λ is topologically transitive if there exists a dense forward orbit, or equivalently, if for any non-empty open sets U,V of Λ, there exists n  ≥  1 such that [formula]. Later on, Bowen noticed [\cite=bowen] that each piece Ωi admits a further decomposition [formula] into disjoint closed subsets on each of which [formula] is topologically mixing: for any non-empty open sets U,V of Xi,j, there exists n0  ≥  1 such that [formula] for any n  ≥  n0.

Let [formula] denote the space of C1-diffeomorphisms of a connected compact boundaryless manifold M endowed with the C1-topology. Our goal is to study the recurrence of its generic non-hyperbolic elements. A robust obstruction to the transitivity is the existence of a trapping region, i.e. a non-empty open set U  ≠  M such that [formula]. When this obstruction does not occur, it follows from [\cite=bc] that the generic dynamics is transitive on the whole manifold. More precisely, in this case M is a homoclinic class (see the section [\ref=s.period] below) implying that an iterate g = fn of f is topologically mixing. Our goal here is to show that this is also the case for the first iterate f:

There exists a dense Gδ subset [formula] such that any transitive diffeomorphism f∈G is topologically mixing.

A similar statement was obtained in [\cite=aab] for flows but the case of diffeomorphisms is more difficult: the proof requires closing and connecting lemmas in order to build segments of orbit which visit successively two given regions U,V. For technical reasons, the obtained orbits may be shorter than what is expected (see [\cite=survey]) so that the intersections between fn(U) and V could occur only at some particular times n, breaking down the topological mixing. The main point of the present paper is thus a closing lemma with control of the connecting time (section [\ref=s.closing]).

Many examples of non-hyperbolic robustly transitive diffeomorphisms have been constructed, see for instance [\cite=bd] and [\cite=shub]. Theorem [\ref=t.transitive] trivially implies that these dynamics become topologically mixing modulo an arbitrarily small C1-perturbation. In some particular cases, there is a stronger result: among robustly transitive partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with one-dimensional center bundle, the set topologically mixing dynamics contains an open and dense subset, see [\cite=hhu] and [\cite=bdu].

As far as we know, all of the known examples of robustly transitive diffeomorphisms are topologically mixing. This raises the following questions:

Is every robustly transitive diffeomorphism topologically mixing?

Failing that, is topological mixing at least a C1-open-and-dense condition within the space of all robustly transitive diffeomorphisms?

When M is connected and ω is a volume or a symplectic form, we denote by [formula] the space of the C1-diffeomorphisms which preserve ω, endowed with the C1-topology. The results stated before still hold in the conservative setting and moreover any C1-generic diffeomorphism is transitive [\cite=abc] [\cite=bc]. One thus gets:

Any diffeomorphism in a dense Gδ subset [formula] is topologically mixing.

We in fact obtain a version of the previous statement for locally maximal sets, i.e. invariant compact sets Λ  ⊂  M having a neighborhood U such that [formula]. Conley has proved [\cite=conley] for homeomorphisms of Λ that the non-existence of a trapping region is equivalent to chain-transitivity: for any ε > 0, there exists a ε-dense periodic sequence [formula] in Λ which is a ε-pseudo orbit, that is satisfies d(f(xi),xi + 1) < ε for any 0  ≤  i < n. As a consequence of [\cite=bc], for C1-generic diffeomorphisms, any maximal invariant set which is chain-transitive is also transitive. Generalizing Bowen's result for hyperbolic diffeomorphisms, we prove:

There exists a dense Gδ subset [formula] (or [formula]) of diffeomorphisms f such that any chain-transitive locally maximal set Λ decomposes uniquely as the finite union [formula] of disjoint compact sets on each of which [formula] is topologically mixing.

Moreover, for [formula], any hyperbolic periodic p,q∈Λi with same stable dimension satisfy:

[formula] is the smallest positive integer such that [formula],

Λi coincides with the closure of [formula].

Clearly, theorems [\ref=t.transitive] and [\ref=t.conservatif] follow from theorem [\ref=t.main].

The period of a homoclinic class

Let f be a C1-diffeomorphism and O be a hyperbolic periodic orbit. We denote by W  ~  W' the set of transversal intersection points between two submanifolds W,W'  ⊂  M.

2.1  Homoclinic class.

The homoclinic class H(O) of O is the closure of the set of transverse intersection points between the stable and unstable manifolds Ws(O) and Wu(O). We refer to [\cite=newhouse] for its basic properties, which we now recall:

Two hyperbolic periodic orbit O1,O2 are homoclinically related if Ws(O1) intersects transversally Wu(O2) and Wu(O2) intersects transversally Ws(O1). This defines an equivalence relation on the set of hyperbolic periodic orbits.

H(O) is the closure of the union of the periodic orbits homoclinically related to O.

If O,O' are homoclinically related, H(O) coincides with the closure of the set of transversal intersections between Wu(O) and Ws(O').

A homoclinic class is a transitive invariant set.

2.2   Period of a homoclinic class.

The period [formula] of the homoclinic class H(O) of O is the greatest common divisor of the periods of the hyperbolic periodic points homoclinically related to O. The group [formula] is called the set of periods of H(O). We have the following characterization: for p∈O, and [formula], the manifolds Wu(fn(p)) and Ws(p) have a transversal intersection if and only if [formula]. More generally:

Consider a hyperbolic periodic point q whose orbit is homoclinically related to O and such that [formula]. Then [formula] if and only if [formula]. In particular Wu(q) intersects transversally Ws(p).

This proposition is a consequence of Smale's theorem on transversal homoclinic points [\cite=smale-homoclinic] and of Palis' inclination lemma [\cite=palis] (or λ-lemma).

Let p,q be two hyperbolic periodic points whose orbits are homoclinically related and assume that [formula]. Let Gp,q be the set of integers n such that [formula].

The set Gp,q is invariant by addition. Indeed if n∈Gp,q, then Wu(fn(q))  ~  Ws(p) and Wu(fn(p))  ~  Ws(fn(q)) are non-empty. The inclination lemma implies that Ws(p) accumulates on Ws(fn(q)) so that it transversally intersects Wu(fn(p)). If moreover m∈Gp,q, we have [formula], so that Ws(p) intersects transversally Wu(fn + m(q)) and n + m∈Gp,q.

The set Gp,q is invariant by subtraction by the period r of p. Hence, for n∈Gp,q, the opposite - n = (r - 1).n - r.n also belongs to Gp,q. So Gp,q coincides with Gq,p and is a group.

If q' is another hyperbolic periodic point whose orbit is homoclinically related to those of p,q and satisfies [formula], then Gp,q = Gp,q'. Indeed the stable and the unstable manifolds of q,q' intersect transversally, and the unstable manifolds of fn(q) and fn(q') intersect the same stable manifolds. Consequently the group G = Gp,q contains all the periods of the hyperbolic periodic orbits homoclinically related to the orbit O of p. In particular, G contains [formula].

Conversely, let us consider n∈G and an intersection point x∈Wu(fn(p))  ~  Ws(p). One defines a local diffeomorphism g which coincides with fr in a (fixed) neighborhood of p and which sends an iterate xu = f- n - ku.r(x)∈Wu(p) onto an iterate xs = fks.r(x)∈Ws(p). Since by Smale's homoclinic theorem the orbits of xs,xu,p for g are contained in a hyperbolic set, one can shadow a pseudo-orbit [formula] by a hyperbolic periodic orbit that is homoclinically related to p. By construction this orbit is contained in a hyperbolic periodic orbit O' of f that is homoclinically related to O and whose period has the form n + k.r for some [formula], where r is the period of p. This implies that n belongs to [formula], so that [formula].

2.3   Pointwise homoclinic class.

If p is a point of the hyperbolic periodic orbit O, its pointwise homoclinic class h(p) is the closure of the set of transverse intersection points between the manifolds Ws(p) and Wu(p): this set is in general not invariant by f.

If the orbit of a hyperbolic periodic point q is homoclinically related to O and Wu(p),Ws(q) have a transverse intersection point, then h(p) coincides with the closure of the set of transversal intersections between Wu(p) and Ws(q). In particular h(p) = h(q).

By proposition [\ref=p.intersection] Wu(q) and Ws(p) have a transverse intersection point. If n,m are the periods of p and q, then for fnm the points p,q are fixed, homoclinically related and their homoclinic class coincide with h(p),h(q) and with the set of transversal intersections between Wu(p) and Ws(q).

The following proposition decomposes the homoclinic classes in the form [formula] such that [formula] is topologically mixing on each piece Λi. However, a priori the pieces are not disjoint.

Let p∈O and [formula] be the period of the homoclinic class. Then:

H(O) is the union of the iterates fk(h(p));

h(p) is invariant by [formula];

the restriction of [formula] to h(p) is topologically mixing;

if [formula] has non-empty interior in H(O), then fj(h(p)) = fk(h(p)).

Let m,n,k be three integers. We claim that the closure of Wu(fk(p))  ~  Ws(fm(p)) is either empty or coincides with [formula]. Indeed the first set coincides with the image by [formula] of the closure of [formula]. If this set is non-empty, one deduces that [formula] belongs to [formula], hence [formula] and Wu(p) accumulate on each other. Similarly, [formula] and Ws(p) accumulate on each other. Consequently the closure of [formula] coincides with h(p), proving the claim.

The claim immediately implies that H(O) coincides with the union of the iterates of h(p) and that [formula] coincides with h(p). Hence the two first items hold.

Let U,V  ⊂  M be two open sets which intersect h(p). We have to show that for any large n, the intersection [formula] intersects h(p). We first introduce two points [formula] and [formula]. Let us consider a disc [formula] containing x. The inclination lemma shows that for n large [formula] accumulates on any disc of Wu(p), and hence on the local unstable manifold of y. As a consequence, for n large [formula] intersects transversally in V the local stable manifold of y, which proves the third item in the statement.

Let Ak denote the interior of fk(h(p)) in H(O): it is non-empty and dense in fk(h(p)). The open and dense subset [formula] of H(O) is the disjoint union of elements of the form [formula]. By construction this partition is invariant by f. Since the restriction of [formula] to each set Ak is topologically mixing, one deduces that Ak is not subdivided by the partition. This means that either Aj = Ak or [formula]. In the latter case one gets fj(h(p)) = fk(h(p)) proving the last item.

2.4   Perturbation of the period.

For any diffeomorphism g close to f, one can consider the hyperbolic continuation Og of O. By the implicit function theorem a given transverse intersection between Ws(O) and Wu(O) will persist, and hence the period of the homoclinic class of Og depends upper-semi-continously with g. The following perturbation lemma provides a mechanism for the non-continuity of the period.

Let us consider [formula], for some r  ≥  1, and two hyperbolic periodic orbits O,O' having a cycle: [formula] and [formula].

If the period of the orbit O' does not belong to the set of periods [formula] of the class H(O), then there exists a diffeomorphism g that is arbitrarily Cr-close to f such that [formula].

Let us assume that the stable dimension of O1 is smaller than or equal to that of O2. Let us choose p∈O and q∈O' so that Ws(p) and Wu(q) have an intersection point x and for some [formula] the manifolds Wu(fn(p)) and Ws(q) have an intersection point y. One can perturb f in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of y so that the intersection becomes quasi-transversal (i.e. TyWu(O) + TyWs(O') = TyM), hence robust, and we have not modified the orbits of p,q,x.

The inclination lemma ensures that Wu(fn(p)) accumulates on Wu(q). This shows that if one fixes a small neighborhood U of x, there exist xs∈Ws(p) and xu∈Wu(fn(p)) arbitrarily close to x whose respective future and past semiorbits avoid U. By a small Cr-perturbation it is thus possible to create a transverse intersection between Ws(p) and Wu(fn(p)) so that after the perturbation n belongs to the set of periods of the homoclinic class of O.

If [formula] we are done. Otherwise, if r is the period of O' then [formula]. One can thus repeat the same construction replacing n by [formula] and obtain the conclusion.

2.5   Relative homoclinic classes.

If O is contained in an open set U, one defines the relative homoclinic class H(O,U) of O in U as the closure of [formula]. It is a transitive invariant compact set contained in [formula].

All the results stated in the previous sections remain valid if one considers hyperbolic periodic orbits and transverse homoclinic/heteroclinic orbits in U. For instance, two hyperbolic periodic orbits O1,O2  ⊂  U are homoclinically related in U if both Ws(O1)  ~  Wu(O2) and Ws(O2)  ~  Wu(O1) meet [formula]. The homoclinic class H(O,U) coincides with the closure of the set of hyperbolic periodic points whose orbit is homoclinically related to O in U.

The relative pointwise homoclinic class h(p,U) is the intersection [formula].

A closing lemma with time control

Pugh's closing lemma [\cite=pugh] allows one to turn any non-wandering point into a periodic point via a small C1-perturbation of the dynamics. The proof selects a segment of orbit of the original diffeomorphism which will be closed, so that it is difficult to control the period of the obtained orbit. In order to control the period of the closed orbit we propose here a different argument which uses several orbit segments of the original dynamics, as in the proof of Hayashi's connecting lemma. A technical condition appears on the periodic points.

A periodic point x is non-resonant if, for the tangent map Dxfr at the period, the eigenvalues having modulus equal to one are simple (i.e. their characteristic spaces are one-dimensional) and do not satisfy relations of the form

[formula]

where the numbers [formula] are distinct and the ki are positive integers.

This is obviously satisfied by hyperbolic periodic points. Also this condition is generic in [formula] and in [formula], see [\cite=kupka] [\cite=robinson] [\cite=smale-kupka]. The statement of the closing lemma with time control is the following.

Let f be a C1-diffeomorphism, [formula] be an integer, x be either a non-periodic point or a non-resonant periodic point. Assume that each neighborhood V of x intersects some iterate fn(V) such that n is not a multiple of [formula]. Then, for diffeomorphisms g arbitrarily C1-close to f, x is periodic and its period is not a multiple of [formula].

If moreover there exists an open set U such that each small neighborhood V of x has a forward iterate fn(V) which intersects V and such that [formula] are contained in U, then the orbit of x under g can be chosen in U. If f belongs to [formula], so does g.

Pugh's algebraic lemma and tiled perturbation domains

The main connexion results for the C1-topology [\cite=pugh] [\cite=pugh-robinson] [\cite=hayashi] [\cite=bc] [\cite=abc] [\cite=approximation] are obtained by using the two following tools. The first one allows to perform independent elementary perturbations. They are usually obtained through Pugh's "algebraic" lemma (the name refers to the proof which only involves sequences of linear maps) and with combinatorial arguments.

Let d be the dimension of M. A cube C of [formula] is the image of the standard cube d by a translation and an homothety. For λ > 0 we denote λ.C the cube having the same barycenter and whose edges have a length equal to λ times those of C. A cube C of a chart [formula] of M is the preimage by φ of a cube C' of [formula]. The cube λ.C is the preimage φ- 1(λ.C').

In the following, one will fix a C1-diffeomorphism f, a neighborhood [formula], and:

some constants θ,δ provided by the elementary perturbation lemma and associated to the neighborhood [formula] of the identity;

an integer N  ≥  1 and a finite collection of charts [formula] given by Pugh's algebraic lemma and associated to the constant η = (θ / 4)4d.

The collection of charts {φs}s∈S is a tiled perturbation domain if we have:

the fk(Vs), with s∈S, 0  ≤  k < N - 1, have diameter <  δ and are pairwise disjoint;

each set Vk is tiled, i.e. is the union of cubes (the tiles) with pairwise disjoint interior satisfying: each tile C intersects (is adjacent to) at most 4d other tiles, each of them having a diameter which differs from the diameter of C by a factor in

[formula]

Any point distinct from its N - 1-first iterates belongs to a tiled domain, see figure 1 in [\cite=bc]. Note also that if the interior of 3 / 2.C and 3 / 2.C' intersect, then the tiles C,C' are adjacent.

The orbit selection

The perturbation domain is used to connect together a collection of segments of orbits of f.

A pseudo-orbit with jumps in the perturbation domain is a sequence (yi) such that for each i, either f(yi) = yi + 1 or the points yi, f- 1(yi + 1) are contained in a same set Vs.

We are interested by the following additional properties:

When the yi, f- 1(yi + 1) belong to Vs, there is a connecting sequence [formula] with ai,0 = yi and ai,N = fN - 1(yi + 1) such that for each 0  ≤  k < N, the ball Bi,k = B(ai,k,ri,k) with ri,k  =  θ- 1.d(ai,k,f- 1(ai,k + 1)) is contained in fk(Vs).

The balls Bi,k are pairwise disjoint.

In order to control the periodic pseudo-orbits, we also introduce an integer [formula].

The length of the periodic pseudo-orbit [formula] is not a multiple of [formula].

When a pseudo-orbit [formula] satisfies conditions 1), 2) and f(y0)  ≠  y1, one can apply the elementary perturbation lemma and build a diffeomorphism g∈U by perturbing f in the union of the balls Bi,k such that the point y0 belongs to a periodic orbit of length n.

These conditions can be obtained by the following proposition.

Let (yi) be a periodic pseudo-orbit with jumps in the perturbation domain such that when yi, f- 1(yi + 1) differ, they are contained in a same tile of the perturbation domain.

Then there exists another periodic pseudo-orbit with jumps in the perturbation domain which satisfies 1) and 2). Moreover if the first pseudo-orbit satisfies 3), then so does the second one.

Note that by an arbitrarily small modification of the initial pseudo-orbit, the points of the pseudo-orbit do not belong to the boundaries of the tiles. In this way, to each point of the pseudo-orbit which belong to the perturbation domain is associated a unique tile.

The shortcut process.

The new orbit is obtained from the first one by performing successive shortcuts: if [formula] is a first periodic pseudo-orbit with jumps in the perturbation domain and if yi,yj for some i < j belong to a same set Vk, then [formula] and [formula] are two new periodic pseudo-orbits with jumps in the perturbation domain. In the process, we keep one of them and continue with further shortcuts. Note that if the initial orbit satisfies 3), i.e. if n is not a multiple of [formula], then the periods of the two new orbits cannot be both multiple of [formula]: we can thus choose a new orbit which still satisfies 3).

Primary shortcuts avoiding accumulations in tiles.

In a first step, we perform shortcuts so that the new periodic pseudo-orbit still has jumps in the tiles of the perturbation domain, but intersect each tile at most once: we perform a shortcut each time we have a pair yi,yj in a same tile of the perturbation domain.

Construction of connecting sequences.

We then consider each jump of the obtained periodic pseudo-orbit [formula] at the end of the first step: these are the indices i such that yi is different from f- 1(yi + 1). By definition the two points belong to a same tile Ci of a domain Vs. One can thus use the property given by Pugh's algebraic lemma and build a connecting sequence [formula] with ai,0 = yi, xi,N = fN - 1(yi + 1), such that for each 0  ≤  k  ≤  N - 1, the distance di,k = d(ai,k,f- 1(ai,k + 1)) is smaller than η times the distance between fk(5 / 4.Ci) and the complement of fk(3 / 2.Ci). We then set ri,k  =  θ- 1.di,k and introduce the ball Bi,k = B(ai,k,ri,k)  ⊂  fk(Vs). By construction the condition 1) is satisfied, but the different balls Bi,k may have non-empty intersection when i varies.

Secondary shortcuts avoiding ball intersections.

Let us now consider the case where two balls Bi,k,Bj,k' intersect. Note that this has to occur in some domain fk(Vs) for a given s∈S, hence we have k = k'. We then perform the shortcut associated to the pair yi,yj. Let us assume for instance that one keeps the orbit [formula] (the other case is similar). As a new connecting sequence between yi and fN - 1(yj) one introduces

[formula]

In this way all the balls associated to the new sequence but one coincide with balls of the former sequences. Only the new ball B'i,k is different: it has the same center as as Bi,k but a larger radius r'i,k. Since the distance between xi,k and f- 1(xj,k + 1) is smaller than 2(ri,k + rj,k), we have

[formula]

The process stops.

Since the initial length of the pseudo-orbit is finite, the process necessarily stops in finite time. We have however to explain why along the secondary shortcut procedure each ball Bi,k does not increase too much and does not leave the sets fk(Vs).

By construction it is centered at a point ai,k associated to a tile Ci. Let us assume that the radius ri,j is a priori bounded by the distance between fk(5 / 4.Ci) and the complement of fk(3 / 2.Ci). Since ai,k∈5 / 4.Ci, the ball Bi,k is contained in 3 / 2.Ci and can only intersect the cubes 3 / 2.C such that C and Ci are adjacent tiles. If Bi,k intersects Bj,k, the point aj,k + 1 is thus associated to a tile adjacent to Ci.

Provided the a priori bound is preserved, the balls centered at ai,k during the process can thus intersect successively at most 4d other balls coming from adjacent tiles. The diameter of the tiles adjacent to Ci is at most twice the diameter of Ci, hence from [\eqref=e.radius] after 4d shortcuts, the diameter of the ball centered at ai,k is bounded from above by (θ / 4)4dη times the distance between fk(5 / 4.Ci) and the complement of fk(3 / 2.Ci). From our choice of η this gives the a priori estimate.

When the process stops, all the balls are disjoint, hence properties 1) and 2) are satisfied. As we already explained, property 3) is preserved.

Proof of theorem [\ref=t.closing]

Let us introduce as before an integer N  ≥  1 and a chart φ:V  →  M of a neighborhood V of x, given by Pugh's algebraic lemma.

The non-periodic case.

Let us first assume that x is non-periodic. If V is taken small enough, it is disjoint from its N - 1 first iterates. It can also be tiled, so that it defines a perturbation domain and x belongs to the interior of some tile C.

By assumption, there exists z∈C and an iterate fn(z)∈C with n  ≥  1 which is not a multiple of [formula]: the sequence [formula] thus defines a periodic pseudo-orbit which satisfies the property 3). Applying proposition [\ref=p.selection], there exists a pseudo-orbit with jumps in the perturbation domain which satisfies all the properties 1), 2) and 3).

One deduces that there exists a diffeomorphism g in the neighborhood U of f having a periodic point in V (close to x) whose period is not a multiple of [formula]. By a new perturbation (a conjugacy), one can ensure that this periodic point coincides with x, as required. The proof is the same in [formula]. When one gives an open set U containing [formula] and [formula], it also contains the obtained periodic orbit.

The periodic case.

When x is periodic, it cannot belong to a tiled domain disjoint from a large number of iterates. However from [\cite=abc], since x is non-resonant, the orbit O of x satisfies the following property (see [\cite=abc]).

A periodic orbit O is circumventable for (φ,N) if there exists

some arbitrarily small neighborhoods W-  ⊂  W+ of O,

an open subset V'  ⊂  V which is a tiled domain of the chart φ,

some families of compact sets D-,D+ contained in the interior of the tiles of V',

such that

any finite segment of orbit which connects W- to [formula] (resp. which connects [formula] to W-) has a point in a compact set of D- (resp. of D+),

for any compact sets D+∈D+, D-∈D-, there exists a pseudo-orbit with jumps in the perturbation domain V' which connects D+ to D- and is contained in W+.

Note that one can assume that the period r of p is a multiple of [formula] since otherwise the conclusion of theorem [\ref=t.closing] already holds. One can consider as before [formula] and an iterate [formula] with n  ≥  1 which is not a multiple of [formula]. Let fk-(z), fk+(z) be the first and the last iterates fk(z) of z with 0  ≤  k  ≤  n which belong to [formula]. The integers k- and n - k+ are multiples of r, and hence of [formula]. As a consequence k+ - k- is not a multiple of [formula]. By definition [\ref=d.circumventable], there exist also some iterates z-,fm1(z-) of z which belong respectively to some compact sets D-∈D- and D+∈D+ respectively and such that m1  ≥  1 is not a multiple of [formula]. There also exist a pseudo-orbit [formula] contained in W+, with jumps in the tiles of V' and such that y0∈D+ and ym2∈D-. In particular, m2 is a multiple of r, and hence of [formula]. One deduces that the pseudo-orbit [formula] has jumps in the tiles of the domain V' and its length m2 + m1 is not a multiple of [formula].

Applying proposition [\ref=p.selection], there exists a pseudo-orbit with jumps in the perturbation domain which satisfies properties 1), 2) and 3). One concludes as in the non-periodic case.

Consequences

We now give the proof of the theorem [\ref=t.main], which implies theorems [\ref=t.transitive] and [\ref=t.conservatif]. It combines the classical generic properties and a standard Baire argument.

The non-conservative case

There exists a dense Gδ subset [formula] of diffeomorphisms f which satisfy:

All the periodic points are hyperbolic.

Any intersection x between the stable Ws(O) and the unstable manifolds Wu(O') of two hyperbolic periodic orbit is transverse, i.e. TxM = TxWs(O) + TxWu(O').

These two items together form the Kupka-Smale property, see [\cite=kupka] [\cite=smale-kupka].

Any locally maximal chain-transitive set is a relative homoclinic class.

If two hyperbolic periodic orbits O,O' are contained in a same chain-transitive set Λ, then by an arbitrarily small C1-perturbation there exists a cycle between O and O' which is contained in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of Λ.

Any two hyperbolic periodic orbit with the same stable dimension, contained in a same chain-transitive set Λ, are homoclinically related in any neighborhood of Λ.

The three last items are direct consequences of the connecting lemma for pseudo-orbits [\cite=bc] (see also [\cite=approximation] for a local version).

For any [formula] and any open set U, let [formula] denote the closure of the set of periodic points whose period is not a multiple of [formula] and whose orbit is contained in U.

If g is C1-close to f, then [formula] is contained in a small neighborhood of [formula].

When all the periodic orbits of f are hyperbolic (or more generally have no eigenvalue equal to 1), f is a lower-semi-continuity point of the map [formula] for the Hausdorff topology. One deduces from Baire's theorem that [formula] is continuous in restriction to a dense Gδ subset [formula]. If f∈G0 does not satisfy the item [\ref=semi-continuity], then there exists a point [formula] which is arbitrarily close to a periodic point p of a diffeomorphism g close to f and whose period is not a multiple of [formula]. By a small perturbation, one can assume that the periodic point p has no eigenvalue equal to 1, and hence one can replace g by any diffeomorphism close: taking g∈G0, one contradicts the continuity of [formula] on G0. This proves the property.

For any hyperbolic periodic orbit O, any neighborhood U of O and any diffeomorphism g C1-close to f, the relative homoclinic class H(Og,U) of g has the same periods as H(O,U).

Indeed we noticed in section 2.4 that the period map [formula] is upper-semi-continuous, and hence is locally constant on an open and dense subset of [formula].

We now fix f∈G and a locally maximal chain-transitive set [formula] in an open set U. By item [\ref=homocline], Λ is a relative homoclinic class H(O,U). Then by proposition [\ref=p.mixing], the set Λ admits an invariant decomposition into compact sets

[formula]

such that for each i, the restriction of [formula] to Λi is topologically mixing, Λi coincides with the pointwise relative homoclinic class of a point of O in U, and [formula] is the period of the relative homoclinic class.

Let us assume by contradiction that Λ1 and Λi intersect for some [formula] at a point x. If x is periodic, then it is hyperbolic by item [\ref=kupka-smale1]. Since [formula] is transitive in Λ1, one deduces that for any neighborhood V of x there exists k  ≥  0 and a segment of orbit [formula] in U with endpoints in V. One can thus apply theorem [\ref=t.closing] and by a C1-perturbation build a periodic point arbitrarily close to x, whose period is not a multiple of [formula] and whose orbit is contained in U. From the item [\ref=semi-continuity], this shows that [formula] contains x. Since Λ is the locally maximal invariant set in U, this shows that it contains a periodic orbit O' whose period is not a multiple of [formula] and which is hyperbolic by the item [\ref=kupka-smale1]. From the item [\ref=cycle], one can create by an arbitrarily small perturbation a cycle between O and O'. From item [\ref=period-robust] and proposition [\ref=p.cycle] the period of O' is contained in the set of periods [formula], a contradiction. The sets Λi are thus pairwise disjoint.

The uniqueness of the decomposition is easy: considering any small open set V intersecting H(O,U), then a large iterate fn(V) meets [formula] if and only if n is a multiple of [formula]. Moreover the closure of [formula], for k0 large, coincides with one of the sets Λi. We have thus obtained the main conclusion of theorem [\ref=t.main].

Let us consider two hyperbolic periodic points p,q∈Λ1 having the same stable dimension. By item [\ref=related], their orbits are homoclinically related in U. The previous discussion shows that Λ1 = h(p,U) = h(q,U) and [formula] is the minimal positive integer such that [formula] is non-empty. By item [\ref=kupka-smale2], the intersections between [formula] and Ws(p) are all transverse, giving the first item of the theorem [\ref=t.main].

There exists a transverse intersection point in Λ between Wu(p) and an iterate Ws(fk(q)). Using the fact that the decomposition of the theorem is an invariant partition into disjoint compact sets, one deduces that fk(q) belongs to Λ1 and that k is a multiple of [formula]. By proposition [\ref=p.intersection], this implies that [formula] is non-empty. Lemma [\ref=l.pointwise] and item [\ref=kupka-smale2] now show that Λ1 = h(p) is the closure of [formula], proving the second item of the theorem.

The conservative case

When dim (M)  ≥  3 and ω is a volume form, the previous proof goes through. In the other cases ω is a symplectic form and the item [\ref=kupka-smale1] may fail. However the same proof can be done replacing the item [\ref=kupka-smale1] by the properties 1' and 1" below.

Any diffeomorphism in a dense Gδ subset [formula] satisfies the items [\ref=kupka-smale2]-[\ref=period-robust] and moreover:

All the periodic points are non-resonant.

Any neighborhood of a periodic orbit O contains a hyperbolic periodic orbit O'. Consider [formula]. If the period of O is not a multiple of [formula], then the same holds for O'.

By [\cite=robinson], there exists a dense Gδ subset Gω' of diffeomorphisms satisfying the item 1'.

One may then use similar arguments as in [\cite=newhouse-symplectic]. Consider any non-hyperbolic periodic point x of a diffeomorphism f, with some period r. Using generating functions, it is possible to build a diffeomorphism [formula] that is C1-close to f such that the dynamics of r in a neighborhood of x is conjugated to a non-hyperbolic linear symplectic map A which is diagonalizable over [formula].

Let [formula] be the eigenvalues of A with modulus one. One can assume moreover that they have the form e2iπpk / qk where [formula]. One deduces that x is the limit of periodic points y whose minimal period is r.L where L is the least common multiple of the qk. The tangent map at y at the period coincides with the identity on its central part. Consequently, one can by a small perturbation turn y to a hyperbolic periodic point. This shows that a diffeomorphism arbitrarily C1-close to f in [formula] has a hyperbolic periodic orbit contained in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the orbit of x and having a period which is not a multiple of [formula].

We end with a Baire argument. For [formula], let us denote by [formula] the subset of diffeomorphisms whose periodic orbits of period less than n which are not a multiple of [formula] are 1 / n-approximated by hyperbolic periodic orbits whose period is not a multiple of [formula]. Since the periodic points of period less than n are finite and vary continuously with the diffeomorphism, this set is open; it is dense by the first part of the proof. We then set [formula].
