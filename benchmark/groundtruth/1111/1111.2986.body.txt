Chow groups of moduli spaces of rank 2 vector bundles on curves with determinant of odd degree.

Theorem.

Theorem. Let X be a smooth projective curve of genus g  ≥  2, d = 2w + 1, w  ≥  2g - 2, Λ be a fixed line bundle on X of degree d, and N be the moduli space of semistable (= stable) rank 2 vector bundles on X of determinant Λ. Denote n = d - 2g + 2, m = d + g - 1, [formula] and SkX a symmetric power of X. All the Chow groups appearing below have integer coefficients.

Then for any l there is a short exact sequence of abelian groups

[formula]

[formula]

Moreover, there is a splitting

[formula]

Both the splitting τ and the morphisms in the exact sequence above are natural in the sense that they may be given explicitely, using standard intersection theory operations and some polynomials (whose coefficients can be determined by an inductive rule) in Chern classes of natural vector bundles defined on various Mi and SkX.

Corollary. For any l there is a finite resolution by abelian groups

[formula]

where each Ωi is an (explicit) direct sum of Chow groups of M0 and various SkX, and the morphisms are natural in the above sense.

Proof.

Background and Notation.

We deduce our theorem from Thaddeus' representation of (a projective bundle over) the moduli space N as a sequence of blow-ups and blow-downs of a projective space [formula]. Let's recall the result due to Thaddeus, which we are going to use [\cite=Thaddeus].

There exists a projective bundle Mw of rank n over N, which can be put into the following sequence of blow-ups and blow-downs with smooth centers of smooth projective varieties:

We use the following notations, when considering the k - th term in the Thaddeus' sequence:

W-k and W+k are vector bundles of ranks k and m - 2k on SkX.

[formula] is embedded by the map i-k into Mk - 1, [formula] is embedded by the map i+k into Mk.

h±k:Z±k  →  SkX are the bundle maps, and ξ±k be the first Chern classes of the corresponding line bundles O(1).

f-k:  →  Mk - 1 and f+k:  →  Mk are blow-ups at Z±k with exceptional divisor E, embedded by the map j into [formula].

g±k:E  →  Z±k are the corresponding projections, which are projective bundles (since the central square is Cartesian) with the first Chern classes of the corresponding line bundles O(1) denoted by ζ±k respectively.

Note that ζ+k = (g-k)*ξ-k, ζ-k = (g+k)*ξ+k, i-k is a regular embedding of codimension m - 2k, and i+k is a regular embedding of codimension k.

m = d + g - 1, d = 2w + 1, w  ≥  2g - 2.

Inductive computation of Chow groups of Mi's

We use the standard formulas describing Chow groups of a blow-up from [\cite=Fulton], section 6.7 twice. First, to express A() in terms of A(Mk - 1) and some part of A(E) (it will be a direct sum of these two terms). As an intermediate step, we use the formula for the projective bundle (twice), to compute A(E) in terms of A(SkX). Finally, we use the formula for Chow groups of blow-ups again (for the blow-up on the right hand side) in order to express A(Mk) in terms of A(). Summarizing, this computes A(Mk) in terms of A(Mk - 1).

Let f:  →  Y be the blowup of Y at X, which is embedded into Y by [formula]. Suppose codimY(X) = d. Let g:  →  X be the exceptional divisor.

Let's denote by ξ the first Chern class of E, where [formula], and by [formula] the corresponding closed embedding. Then from Proposition 6.7 and Theorem 3.3 in [\cite=Fulton], we get an isomorphism:

[formula]

Consequently:

[formula]

where the first map send [formula] to j*, and the second map sends [formula] to f*().

Applying this to our situation, we get the split exact sequence:

[formula]

[formula]

with splitting:

[formula]

Recalling that Z±k are projective bundles over SkX, and applying Theorem 3.3 from [\cite=Fulton], we get:

[formula]

[formula]

with splitting given by [formula].

This sequence reduces to:

[formula]

[formula]

This can be rewritten as:

[formula]

Maps here can be made explicit:

The map on the left sends (vr)r to [formula].

The map on the right sends m + (us)s to [formula].

We used the following notation above: [formula].

This exact sequence has a splitting:

[formula]

where us can be given by a natural formula.

Summing up.

On the previous step we got a sequence of split exact sequences (with obvious notation):

[formula]

k = 0,1,...,w.

Because of the splitting, we can 'sum them up' to get the following split exact sequence:

[formula]

Chow groups of N.

Denote n = d - 2g + 2. We know that Mw is a projective bundle of rank n over N. Denoting by ξ the first Chern class of the corresponding line bundle O(1), we can write by the standard formula for Chow groups of projective bundles (Theorem 3.3 in [\cite=Fulton]) the following split exact sequence:

[formula]

Now, summing this split exact sequence (as we did in the previous section) with sequence ( *  * ), we get the exact sequence stated in the theorem. QED
