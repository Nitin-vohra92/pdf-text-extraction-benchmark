Abstract

We present a method to construct a basis of singular and non-singular common eigenvectors for Gaudin Hamiltonians in a tensor product module of the Lie algebra SL(2). The subset of singular vectors is completely described by analogy with covariant differential operators. The relation between singular eigenvectors and the Bethe Ansatz is discussed. In each weight subspace the set of singular eigenvectors is completed to a basis, by a family of non-singular eigenvectors. We discuss also the generalization of this method to the case of an arbitrary Lie algebra.

Introduction

The Gaudin model [\cite=Gaudinart] is an example of an integrable system in statistical quantum mechanics, associated to N spin particles with magnetic interaction, based on N independent and commuting Hamiltonians. As originally formulated, this model is related to the Lie algebra SL(2). In this simplest case, the problem of the diagonalization of the Hamiltonians was partially solved. Using a constructive method, known as Bethe Ansatz, Gaudin [\cite=Gaudin] constructed a family of common eigenvectors for all Hamiltonians.

More generally, integrable systems can be associated to any semi-simple complex Lie algebra. For such systems, generalizations of the set of Gaudin Hamiltonians have been constructed.[\cite=FFR] The methods proposed for diagonalization of these Hamiltonians revealed remarkable connections between integrable models and two dimensional conformal field theories. In this approach [\cite=FFR], the structure of the Bethe vectors for the Gaudin model is related to the representation theory of affine Lie algebras. The diagonalization of Gaudin Hamiltonians is based on a concept of invariant functionals (correlation functions) on tensor products of representations of an affine Lie algebra at the critical level.

Another approach for the problem of diagonalization,[\cite=BabujianFlume] [\cite=Babujian] is related to the connection between eigenvectors of the Gaudin Hamiltonians and the solutions [\cite=VarchenkoSchechtman] of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations.[\cite=KZ] In this approach, the common eigenvectors are constructed inductively and each eigenvector leads to an integral solution of the KZ equations. Conversely, it was proved [\cite=RV] that in the quasi-classical limit, the first term of the asymptotic solutions of KZ equation leads to a common eigenvector of the Hamiltonians. In this case the Bethe equations for the Gaudin model appear as conditions of critical points.

In section 2 we review some aspects concerning the Gaudin model, originally formulated for the Lie algebra SL(2). We recall the expression of the N Hamiltonians, introduced by Gaudin. The space Ω of physical states is defined as a tensor product of N finite-dimensional highest weight representations of the Lie algebra SL(2). It is decomposed as a direct sum of weight subspaces, i.e., [formula]. We explain how the Bethe Ansatz works to construct common eigenvectors for Gaudin Hamiltonians in each eigenspace Vm. However, this method cannot give all the common eigenvectors of Gaudin Hamiltonians. Therefore, supplementary common eigenvectors have to be determined.

In section 3 we give a general, recursive method to construct a basis of common eigenvectors in each invariant subspace Vm. Knowing a basis of Vm - 1, we construct a family of linear independent common eigenvectors in Vm, which are nonsingular. This family is completed to a basis of Vm, by a basis of the subspace of singular vectors of Vm. Using an analog of the Gordan operator,[\cite=Go] we give a basis of Sing Vm. Finally, we show that the Bethe Ansatz gives a family of singular common eigenvectors for Gaudin Hamiltonians, but in some particular cases, this family could not be complete.

Section 4 is devoted to a discussion of the generalized model associated to an arbitrary simple Lie algebra. We recall the generalization of the Gaudin Hamiltonians and explain how the Bethe Ansatz was generalized to construct common eigenvectors for these Hamiltonians. We show that Bethe equations, which appear as conditions that Bethe type vectors be common eigenvectors, are also conditions of singularity for them. This constructive method does not ensure the completeness of the system of eigenvectors.

Gaudin model and the SL(2) Lie algebra

The Gaudin spin model is related to the Lie algebra SL(2), with generators E, F and H satisfying the commutation relations:

[formula]

For this Lie algebra we consider N finite-dimensional highest weight modules: Vλ1,..., VλN with highest weights λ1,..., λN and highest weight vectors vλ1,..., vλN. The tensor product of these N modules constitutes the space of physical states for a system of N spin particles:

[formula]

The Lie algebra action on each vector [formula] of this tensor module is defined as

[formula]

where X(i) denotes the operator on Ω which acts as X on the [formula] module and as the identity operator on all other factors:

[formula]

For such a system of N spin particles, Gaudin proposed a set of N Hamiltonians defined on Ω, depending on N distinct, complex parameters z1,...,zN :

[formula]

All these operators commute:

[formula]

but they are not independent, because [formula] It can easily be verified that among the N Gaudin Hamiltonians there are exactly N - 1 which are independent. To integrate a system of N spin particles, with N degrees of freedom, the family of commuting operators is completed by the Cartan generator (also called the total spin operator), of which action on the tensor module is

[formula]

and which commutes with all Gaudin Hamiltonians.

For this family of N independent Hamiltonians which commute there is a complete system of common eigenvectors in Ω. Our goal is to construct a basis in Ω, of common eigenvectors of Gaudin Hamiltonians.

The structure of the space Ω

In order to analyze the structure of Ω it is useful to recall some elements of the theory of highest weight representations of the Lie algebra SL(2). Such a representation is completely determined by a highest weight vector vλ, on which the action of the algebra is given by

[formula]

and the representation space is generated by vectors:

[formula]

The action of the Lie algebra on these vectors is

[formula]

If the highest weight λ is not a positive integer, the representation is infinite dimensional and irreducible. If [formula], then in [formula] there is an invariant subspace, generated by {vλ + 1, vλ + 2,...} and the quotient representation is irreducible and finite dimensional, of dimension λ + 1, generated by vectors {vn = Fn vλ}n = 0,...,λ. We denote Vλ this quotient representation, for which we have Fn vλ = 0 for all n  ≥  λ + 1.

We will consider the space Ω as a tensor product of finite-dimensional representations Vλ, which is completely determined by the vector [formula], called vacuum vector and is generated by vectors [formula], with ni operators F applied on the i[formula] component. Such a vector can be written as a product of m = n1 + n2 + ... + nN operators of type ([\ref=Ai]), denoted

[formula]

with 1  ≤  k1  ≤  ...  ≤  km  ≤  N. Note that for finite-dimensional representations, m can vary between 0 and a maximal value [formula].

Note also the particular action of the Hamiltonians on the vacuum vector:

[formula]

The Cartan operator [formula] has a privileged place in the family of commuting Hamiltonians. According to ([\ref=grad]), it gives a gradation of the representation spaces Vλi, which induces a gradation of the tensor product module, on [formula]-invariant subspaces:

[formula]

where Vm is a weight subspace, of weight [formula], also called space of spin deviation m. It is generated by [formula]-eigenvectors:

[formula]

which we call states of spin deviation m:

[formula]

Note that for spin deviations [formula], a subspace Vm has the dimension

[formula]

From the explicit form of the Gaudin Hamiltonians ([\ref=Hi]) and from the action ([\ref=grad])-([\ref=FFk]) of the SL(2) Lie algebra on the spaces Vλi, it follows that the weight subspaces Vm are invariant under the action of any Hi. Therefore, in each subspace Vm, we can construct a basis of common eigenvectors of Hi.

The construction of common eigenvectors by Bethe Ansatz

Bethe Ansatz is a method to construct a family of common eigenvectors for Gaudin Hamiltonians in each invariant subspace Vm, but this family is not a basis of Vm.

Since Vm is generated by ([\ref=bazaVm]), any common eigenvector in Vm has the form

[formula]

The central idea of the Bethe method is to consider the coefficients ck1...km as rational complex functions:

[formula]

depending on some unknown, distinct, complex parameters: w1,...,wm. We call such a vector a Bethe vector. Hereafter we shortly present this method.

Bethe vectors of spin deviation m = 1

The eigenspace V1 is generated by vectors [formula]. A Bethe vector of spin deviation m = 1 is defined as an expansion on this basis, with rational coefficients depending on one complex parameter w:

[formula]

where we denoted by F(w) the operator on Ω:

[formula]

Straightforward calculations give the commutator

[formula]

Applying this operator on v0 and using ([\ref=ecvacuum]) we obtain the action of a Gaudin Hamiltonian Hi on ψ1(w):

[formula]

and we have the following lemma.

Bethe vectors of spin deviation m = 2

The eigenspace V2 is generated by vectors [formula]. A Bethe vector of spin deviation m = 2 is defined as an expansion on this basis, with rational coefficients depending on two complex parameters w1, w2 :

[formula]

Remark that the order of the two operators F is not significant because they commute.

In order to compute the action of a Hamiltonian on this state, we have to commute Hi successively with the two operators F. Using ([\ref=comuthf]) we obtain the commutator formula:

[formula]

From ([\ref=comuthf]) and ([\ref=comut2]) the action of a Gaudin Hamiltonian Hi on the state ψ2 is

[formula]

and we have the following lemma.

Bethe vectors of spin deviation m

In the subspace Vm, generated by vectors [formula], a Bethe vector of spin deviation m is defined as an expansion with coefficients depending on m complex parameters w1,...,wm:

[formula]

The action of a Gaudin Hamiltonian Hi on this state is calculated by induction on m:

[formula]

The first term is computed from the induction hypothesis, the second from ([\ref=comuthf]) and the last term from relation ([\ref=comut2]). Putting all together it follows that

[formula]

where ψm - 1(...,,...) denotes [formula]. Hence, we obtain the following theorem.

As observed in Ref. [\cite=Eu2], the Bethe Ansatz does not give all the common eigenvectors of Gaudin Hamiltonians. Therefore, supplementary common eigenvectors have to be determined, which will be done in the following section.

A construction of a basis of common eigenvectors for Gaudin Hamiltonians

In this section we give a general method to construct a basis of common eigenvectors in each invariant subspace Vm. This is a recursive method, which will be applied for subspaces Vm, with m  ≤   min{λ1,...,λN}. Knowing a basis of Vm - 1, we construct a family of linear independent common eigenvectors in Vm, which are nonsingular. This family is completed to a basis of Vm by a basis of the subspace of singular vectors of Vm.

There are two important properties of Gaudin Hamiltonians which are useful in this section, namely they commute with the operators [formula] and [formula], on the tensor product module:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are defined by ([\ref=X]) as

[formula]

It was shown in Ref. [\cite=Etingof] that the dimension of the subspace Sing Vm is

[formula]

Since according to ([\ref=dimVm]), for m  ≤  {λ1,...,λN} the dimension of the space Vm is Cmm + N - 1, it follows that a basis of Sing Vm can be completed to a basis of Vm, by a family of Cm - 1m + N - 2 nonsingular linear independent vectors. The space spanned by this family of nonsingular vectors is denoted NonSing Vm. Hence,

[formula]

From the property ([\ref=HE]) we obtain the following. Then   Vm admits a basis formed by singular common eigenvectors of Gaudin Hamiltonians Hi. Denote Bsm this basis.

From the property ([\ref=HF]) of the Gaudin Hamiltonians we can construct recursively a basis of common eigenvectors in NonSing Vm:

The basis of common eigenvectors in   Vm is obtained by the application of the operator [formula] on all common eigenvectors (singular and nonsingular) which form the basis of the invariant subspace Vm - 1. Denote Bnsm this basis:

[formula]

where Bm - 1 is a basis of common eigenvectors of Vm - 1.

Proof: (1) The vectors of Bnsm are linear independent. Indeed, for m  ≤  {λ1,...,λN} the operator :Vm - 1  →  Vm is injective, since     =  {0}. Moreover, the injectivity of [formula] implies that the number of elements of the family Bnsm is equal to the dimension of Vm - 1, namely Cm - 1m + N - 2.

(2) The vectors of Bnsm are common eigenvectors of Hi. If vm - 1∈Bm - 1 is a common eigenvector:

[formula]

then, from the property ([\ref=HF]) it follows that the vector vm  =    vm - 1∈Bnsm is also an eigenvector, with the same eigenvalue aim - 1.

(3) The vectors of Bnsm are nonsingular. Note first that in V0 there is only one vector, the vacuum vector v0. Thus, there is one common eigenvector v1  =    v0 in the family Bns1, which is indeed nonsingular:

[formula]

Now suppose by induction that for all k  ≤  m - 1, with m  ≤  {λ1,...,λN}, we have constructed a basis of Vk of the form [formula], where Bnsk is obtained by application of the operator [formula] on vectors of the basis Bk - 1 of Vk - 1. Then for a vector vnsm of Bnsm we have

[formula]

If vm - 1 is singular, then the last term of ([\ref=non-sing]) vanishes and vnsm is nonsingular, since

[formula]

If vm - 1 is nonsingular, then by the induction hypothesis, there is a k∈{1,...,m - 1} such that vm - 1  =  k  vsm - 1 - k with vsm - 1 - k a common singular eigenvector of Bsm - 1 - k. Then relation ([\ref=non-sing]) becomes

[formula]

4) The vectors of Bnsm are linear independent of the singular vectors of the basis Bsm. Consider a null linear combination of the vectors vnsm(i)∈Bnsm and vsm(j)∈Bsm:

[formula]

Applying the operator [formula], the second sum (of singular vectors) vanishes. Hence,

[formula]

It follows from ([\ref=colin]) that each vector   vnsm(i) is colinear with the vector vm - 1(i), which form the basis of Vm - 1. Then, the coefficients a(i) are all zero. Since vsm(j) form also a basis, in Sing Vm, the coefficients b(j) vanish too.

Properties (1)-(4) from above show that [formula] is a basis of NonSing Vm and then [formula] is a basis of common eigenvectors in Vm. In this basis, the sub-family Bnsm is completely determined by Proposition [\ref=prop6], whereas for the subset of singular vectors Bsm we have only the existence Lemma [\ref=lema5] and not the structure. In the next section we will characterize the singular vectors of a tensor product module of SL(2).

Singular vectors of the SL(2) tensor modules

For a finite-dimensional highest weight module [formula] of the Lie algebra SL(2) there is only one singular vector: the highest weight vector [formula]. Nevertheless, for tensor product modules [formula] the vacuum vector [formula] is not the only singular vector. There exist singular vectors in every subspace Vm.

The case N = 2

Consider first N = 2 and [formula] with the decomposition on invariant subspaces [formula]. In this case an invariant subspace Vm is generated by vectors:

[formula]

and the singular vectors of such a subspace are characterized by the following proposition.

Let Vm be an invariant subspace of [formula], with [formula]. Then a vector vsm∈Vm,

[formula]

is singular if and only if the coefficients ck satisfy the conditions

[formula]

The proof is based on straightforward calculation using relation ([\ref=EFk]):

[formula]

Remark that the conditions ([\ref=cond_ck]), satisfied by the coefficients ck, coincide with the conditions determined in Ref. [\cite=Eu1], satisfied by the coefficients of a bilinear differential operator which is projective covariant. The system ([\ref=cond_ck]) was solved in this article and for [formula] it admits a unique solution (up to a constant factor):

[formula]

with Ckm the binomial coefficient and (x)i the Pochhammer symbol:

[formula]

By analogy with covariant differential operators, we introduce the bilinear operator Pm defined on the subspace Vm of [formula] by

[formula]

which is analogous to the Gordan operator.

Conclusion. In the case of N = 2 in every invariant subspace Vm with [formula] there is a unique singular vector (up to a constant factor) which is

[formula]

The case N = 3

Consider now N = 3 and [formula] with its decomposition on invariant subspaces. In this case, a subspace Vm is generated by vectors:

[formula]

and the singular vectors of this subspace are characterized by the following result.

Let Vm be an invariant subspace of [formula], with [formula]. Then a vector vsm of Vm,

[formula]

is singular if and only if the coefficients ck1k2 satisfy the conditions:

[formula]

The proof is analogous to that of N = 2. As in the case N = 2, we note that the system ([\ref=cond_ck12]), which has to be satisfied by the coefficients of the development ([\ref=vect_N3]) in order that vsm be singular, coincides with the conditions satisfied by the coefficients of a trilinear differential operator which is projective covariant [\cite=Eu1]. The system ([\ref=cond_ck12]) was also solved in Ref. [\cite=Eu1] and for [formula] it admits m + 1 linear independent solutions. In addition, it was shown that the space of covariant trilinear operators is generated only by successive applications of covariant bilinear operators.

Conclusion. In the case of N = 3 in every subspace Vm with [formula] there are m + 1 linear independent singular vectors:

[formula]

Moreover, using the operator on Ω introduced in ([\ref=Pgras]) we can construct a basis of Sing Vm, given by the vectors

[formula]

General case

The results obtained for N = 2 and N = 3 can be generalized for an arbitrary N. For each N  ≥  2, consider the space [formula], where [formula] and define on ΩN the operator

[formula]

where [formula] is defined by ([\ref=X]) on ΩN - 1. Then we have the following.

Let Vm be an invariant subspace of  ΩN with [formula]. Then in Vm there is a family of Cmm + N - 2 linear independent singular vectors, given by the formula

[formula]

where vsm - k is a singular vector of weight [formula] in the basis of the subspace   Vm - k of  ΩN - 1.

The singularity of these vectors arises from straightforward calculation analogous to the case N = 2.

These vectors are linear independent because vsm - k are the elements of the basis of the subspace Sing Vm - k of ΩN - 1 and for different k the maximal number of operators F applied on the last component vλN is different.

The fact that by this construction we obtain exactly Cmm + N - 2 linear independent singular vectors, can be demonstrated by induction with respect to N: For N = 2 and N = 3 this number of singular vectors was already obtained. Suppose now that for an arbitrary N the number of linear independent singular vectors vsm - k in Vm - k is Cm - km - k + N - 2. Then for N + 1, the number of linear independent singular vectors obtained by the construction ([\ref=vect_N]) is

[formula]

Proposition [\ref=prop9] allows to construct inductively a basis in Sing Vm which has the form

[formula]

Remark. We point out that in this section we have considered invariant subspaces Vm of Ω with spin deviation m which does not exceed any of the N weights [formula]:

[formula]

If m is greater than at least one of the weights λi, then in the set

[formula]

there are elements for which the number of operators F acting on vλi is greater then λi. These vectors are zero because for finite-dimensional irreducible representations of SL(2) we have [formula]. Therefore in this case the dimension of the space Vm is less then Cmm + N - 1 and depends on the weights λ which are less then m.

Moreover, if m exceeds one or more of the weights λ, the dimension of the space Sing Vm is also less than Cmm + N - 2. For example, in the case N = 2, it was shown in Ref. [\cite=Eu1] that for m  ≤  mmax  =  λ1  +  λ2, but m > λ1 and m > λ2 there are two independent bilinear covariant differential operators, to which correspond singular vectors of the type

[formula]

which are zero in the considered finite-dimensional irreducible representations of SL(2). For an arbitrary N we claim that relation ([\ref=bazasing]) still gives the basis of Sing Vm but some of the elements of the form ([\ref=bazasing]) vanish. This fact implies the decreasing of the dimension of Sing Vm.

Singular common eigenvectors and Bethe Ansatz

The basis ([\ref=bazasing]) of Sing Vm constructed in the previous section is not a basis of common eigenvectors. In this section we show that the Bethe eigenvectors constructed in Sec. II using the Bethe Ansatz are singular, but their number could be less than the dimension of Sing Vm. More precisely, the Bethe equations ([\ref=bethem]), which appear in the Bethe Ansatz as conditions that Bethe type vectors ([\ref=bethevectpsim]) be common eigenvectors of Hi are also conditions that Bethe type vectors be singular.

If the distinct parameters w1,...,wm are solutions of the Bethe system:

[formula]

then the corresponding Bethe type vector ψm(w1,...,wm)  v0  =  F(w1)...F(wm)v0 of Vm is a singular vector of the tensor product module Ω.

Proof. Using the commutators,

[formula]

with [formula], we obtain

[formula]

Therefore if the parameters w1,...,wm are solutions of the system ([\ref=eqprop10]), then ψm(w1,...,wm) is a singular vector.

The number of common Bethe eigenvectors is equal to the number of distinct solutions of the Bethe system ([\ref=eqprop10]). If they are Cmm + N - 2 then they form a basis of Sing Vm. For m = 1 and m = 2 we can easily show that the number of complex solutions of the Bethe system is N - 1 and N(N - 1) / 2, respectively, but we cannot say how many of them are distinct. For example, in the case m = 1, N = 3, the Bethe equation is equivalent to a second order equation. For some particular values of the parameters λi and zi, i = 1,2,3, this equation could have a double solution.

For arbitrary m and N, the number of solutions of the Bethe system seems to be Cmm + N - 2 but to our knowledge there is no estimate of the number of distinct solutions. In any case, the Bethe Ansatz gives a family of singular common eigenvectors which could be completed, if necessary, to a basis of Sing Vm with common eigenvectors constructed using the basis ([\ref=bazasing]).

The Gaudin model for an arbitrary simple Lie algebra G

Consider a simple Lie algebra G, of dimension d and rank r. Denote Δ the root system of G, Δ+ the system of positive roots and Δ0 the system of simple roots. The Cartan basis of G is formed by the Cartan generators [formula], the generators of positive roots [formula] and the generators of negative roots [formula]. The commutation relations are

[formula]

The Killing form of G defines a symmetrical, G-invariant, bilinear form <    ,    >   on G, which allows us to identify the Cartan sub-algebra K of G with its dual, by the isomorphism α(H) =  < Hα,H > , for all H∈K. The scalar product on K induces a scalar product on its dual, which is nondegenerate,

[formula]

normalized such that <  αl,αl >  = 2 for a long root αl.

All generators of G are orthogonal with respect to the bilinear form <    ,    >   except

[formula]

where [formula] is the square of the length of a long root. Then, for the Cartan basis we can define the dual basis with respect to this bilinear form:

[formula]

such that < Hi,H̃j >  = δij and < Eα,Ẽβ >  =  < Fα,β >  = δαβ.

For this algebra, consider N finite-dimensional highest weight G-modules,  Vλ1,..., VλN, with dominant integral highest weights λ1,..., λN and highest weight vectors vλ1,..., vλN. The tensor product module of these G-modules is the space of physical states:

[formula]

Recall that the Lie algebra action on this tensor module is defined by ([\ref=X]).

The fundamental building blocks of the generalized Gaudin Hamiltonians are the quadratic generalized Casimir operators, defined on Ω as

[formula]

where [formula] is a basis of G and [formula] its dual with respect to the scalar product, < Ia,Ĩb >  = δba. We recall two fundamental properties of these operators, which will be useful in this section.

(1) ω(ij) are independent of the choice of the basis in G. In particular, in the Cartan basis they take the form

[formula]

(2) ω(ij) commute with the action of the algebra on the tensor module:

[formula]

The operators ω(ij) do not commute between themselves, but we can construct N linear combinations which commute.

In particular, if z1,...,zN are distinct complex parameters, the coefficients [formula] fulfill the conditions ([\ref=eqc]). With these coefficients we can construct the following N operators on Ω:

[formula]

which are the generalized Gaudin Hamiltonians. They preserve the properties (1) and (2) of the operators ω(ij). More precisely, if we consider the Cartan basis in G, we have

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula] are operators on the tensor product module, defined by ([\ref=X]). The generalized Gaudin Hamiltonians commute between themselves, but only N - 1 of them are independent. Due to the property ([\ref=P1]) we can complete this system by other r operators, the generators α of the Cartan sub-algebra, which commute with all Hi. For this family of independent and commuting Hamiltonians there is a complete system of common eigenvectors in Ω.

The structure of Ω

Since the space Ω is a tensor product of N highest weight representations Vλ of G, it is useful to recall some basic results concerning the theory of highest weight representations of Lie algebras.

Such a representation is completely determined by a highest weight vector vλ, on which the action of the algebra is given by

[formula]

As in the SL(2) case, the representation space Vλ is linearly generated only by monomials in generators of negative roots:

[formula]

but in this case, the monomials are ordered with respect to the roots, as showed by the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem.[\cite=Wan] These vectors are eigenvectors for the Cartan generators:

[formula]

and the action of a positive root generator on monomials [formula] is

[formula]

Concerning the dimension of a highest weight representation of G, recall that a weight λ is a dominant integral if

[formula]

If the highest weight λ is not dominant integral, then the representation is infinite dimensional and irreducible. If the highest weight λ is dominant integral then there is an invariant subspace,[\cite=Wan] generated by vectors vn1...nlα1...αl, with nα  ≥  rα + 1. The quotient representation, denoted Vλ is an irreducible, finite-dimensional representation of G, generated by ordered monomials:

[formula]

As in the SL(2) case, the space Ω is a finite-dimensional tensor product module of G, completely determined by the vacuum vector [formula] and generated by ordered monomials:

[formula]

with 1  ≤  ki  ≤  N. Note that for finite-dimensional representations, m can vary between 0 and a maximal value [formula]. Note also that the action of the Hamiltonians on the vacuum vector is

[formula]

As in the case of the Lie algebra SL(2), the Cartan operators β have the particular role to give a gradation of the tensor product module:

[formula]

on weight subspaces Vμ, of weight [formula], generated by β eigenvectors:

[formula]

with γ1,...,γm∈Δ+ and 1  ≤  ki  ≤  N. Since a positive root can be written as a sum of simple roots, with positive integer coefficients, in a unique way, the weight subspaces will be labeled by a family of simple roots: Vμ  =  Vα1...αs, with α1...αs∈Δ0, not necessarily distinct and satisfying [formula]. Hence

[formula]

From the explicit form of the generalized Gaudin Hamiltonians ([\ref=Higen]) and from the action ([\ref=Fvgen])-([\ref=Evgen]) of the Lie algebra on each module Vλi, it follows that the weight subspaces Vα1...αs are invariant under the action of any Hi. Therefore, in each subspace Vα1...αs, we can construct a basis of common eigenvectors of Hi.

Unlike the case of the Lie algebra SL(2), there is no result concerning the dimension of the invariant subspaces Vα1...αs and neither for Sing Vα1...αs. However, using the properties ([\ref=P2]) and ([\ref=P3]), the recursive procedure presented in Sec. III can be generalized to construct in each subspace Vα1...αs a family of common nonsingular eigenvectors, by applying operators αi on vectors of the sub-spaces Vα1...αi - 1αi + 1...αs. Concerning the subspace of singular vectors in Vα1...αs we do not have a generalization of the result presented in Sec. III A, for the construction of a basis of singular vectors. The only result [\cite=BabujianFlume] concerning this problem is a generalization of the Bethe Ansatz, which we discuss hereafter.

Common eigenvectors in Vα

Consider a simple root α. The subspace Vα of weight [formula] is generated by vectors [formula]. A Bethe vector in this subspace is defined as an expansion on the basis, with rational coefficients depending on one complex parameter w:

[formula]

To give the action of a Hamiltonian Hi on this vector it is useful to calculate the commutator:

[formula]

Applied on the vacuum vector all the terms of the last sum vanish and the action of a Gaudin Hamiltonian Hi on the vector ([\ref=psi1]) is

[formula]

Hence we have the following.

Common eigenvectors in Vα1,α2

Consider two simple roots α1 and α2, which are not necessarily distinct. The subspace Vα1,α2, of weight [formula] is generated by vectors [formula], with two generators of negative roots applied on two distinct components of v0, but also by vectors [formula] and [formula] with two generators of negative roots applied on the same component of v0. A Bethe vector in Vα1,α2 is defined as an expansion on all these vectors, with some particular coefficients depending on two complex parameters w1,w2:

[formula]

As element of the representation space Vλk, one of the two last terms is not a good ordered monomial and we must write, for instance, [formula]. Then this vector can be also written in the following form, using the operators F:

[formula]

In order to compute the action of a Hamiltonian Hi on the vector ψ2, we use the result ([\ref=Hpsial]) and ([\ref=Hipsi1]) to obtain

[formula]

where

[formula]

Note that the action of Hi on the second term of the vector ([\ref=twopsi]) must be calculated separately, because ([\ref=Hipsi1]) does not hold for the positive root α1  +  α2 which is no more simple. It follows from these considerations the following lemma.

Common eigenvectors in Vα1,...,αm

For m simple roots α1,...,αm, not necessarily distinct, the subspace Vα1,...,αm of weight [formula] is generated by ordered monomials  F(k1)γ1...F(kn)γnv0  with k1,...,kn = 1,...,N and γ1,...,γn positive roots with [formula]. In this general case it is difficult to define an appropriate Bethe type vector, with rational coefficients on the basis of Vα1,...,αm. In Ref. [\cite=BabujianFlume] a recursive procedure was proposed to define such a vector:

[formula]

with [formula]. However, to our knowledge there is no proof that the action of a Hamiltonian Hi on the vector ψmv0 is

[formula]

with km some vectors in Vα1,...,αm and

[formula]

Such a recursive construction of generalized Bethe vectors seems to be appropriate for inductive calculations, but for the action ([\ref=eq25]) of Hamiltonians on these vectors such a calculation raises some problems, as explained in Ref. [\cite=Eu2]. Similar problems occur if we intend to prove inductively that all Bethe eigenvectors are singular. For a small number of roots this can be done by direct calculation.

We call vs∈Ω a singular vector of Ω if all the generators of simple roots α act trivially on vs:

[formula]

Note first that [formula] for any simple roots α and β.

Consider now the weight subspace Vα. If β is a simple root we have

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

Therefore, if w is a solution of the Bethe equation ([\ref=betheal]), then ψ1(w,α)  v0 is a singular vector of Vα.

In order to calculate the action of a generator Eβ of simple root on a generalized Bethe vector ([\ref=twopsi]) of Vα1,α2, we use ([\ref=Epsi1wa]) but also

[formula]

to obtain

[formula]

Therefore, if (w1,w2) is a solution of the Bethe equations ([\ref=betheeq2]), then ψ2(w1,α1;w2,α2)  v0 is a singular vector of Vα1,α2.

For Bethe vectors ([\ref=eq24]) depending on more than 3 simple roots we claim that the commutator of β with ψm is given by

[formula]

where ψm - 1(......) denotes ψm - 1(...wi - 1,αi - 1;wi + 1,αi + 1...). As for the action ([\ref=eq25]) of the Hamiltonians, there is no inductive proof of this relation. The action of β on the Bethe vector is then

[formula]

Hence, the Bethe vector is singular if the parameters w satisfy the Bethe equations fmk = 0, [formula].

Conclusions

In this article we recall the Gaudin model associated to the Lie algebra SL(2) and its partial diagonalization by the Bethe Ansatz.

We give a general recursive method to construct a basis of common eigenvectors in each invariant subspace Vm. Knowing a basis of Vm - 1, we construct a family of nonsingular independent common eigenvectors in Vm. This family is completed to a basis of Vm, by a basis of the subspace of singular vectors of Vm.

In order to describe the subspace Sing Vm, we establish a relation between singular vectors and covariant differential operators. This allows us to construct a basis of Sing Vm using an analog of the Gordan operator. On the other hand we show that the Bethe Ansatz gives a family of singular common eigenvectors. If Bethe equations have a maximal number of distinct solutions, then Bethe eigenvectors form a basis of common eigenvectors in Sing Vm.

We discuss also the generalization of this method to the case of an arbitrary Lie algebra. We recall the generalization of the Gaudin Hamiltonians and of the Bethe Ansatz. The generalized Bethe vectors are defined recursively, but this definition allows neither to calculate the action of the Hamiltonians, nor to prove that Bethe eigenvectors are singular. For a small number of simple roots we prove by direct calculation that the Bethe equations are conditions that Bethe type vectors be singular and common eigenvectors. The recursive method to construct nonsingular common eigenvectors could also be generalized to the case of an arbitrary Lie algebra.
