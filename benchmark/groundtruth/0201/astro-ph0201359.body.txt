V893 Sco is a recently rediscovered bright dwarf nova [\citep=kat98v893sco]. The star was subsequently found to be an eclipsing dwarf nova below the period gap ([\citealt=tho99v893sco]; [\citealt=mat00v893sco]; [\citealt=bru00v893sco]). Most recently, [\citet=mas01v893sco] proposed an idea that V893 Sco is an ER UMa-type dwarf nova. From their analysis of the evolutionary state of V893 Sco, [\citet=mas01v893sco] proposed that all ER UMa stars may be newly formed cataclysmic variables (CVs).

ER UMa stars are a class of SU UMa-type dwarf novae (for a recent review of SU UMa-type dwarf novae, see [\citealt=war95suuma]). ER UMa stars show extremely short (19-50 d) supercycles. i.e. intervals between successive superoutbursts (e.g. [\citealt=kat95eruma]; [\citealt=rob95eruma]; [\citealt=nog95rzlmi]; [\citealt=kat96diuma]).

[\citet=mas01v893sco] analyzed the light curve from VSNET (http://www.kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp/vsnet), and identified outburst intervals of ~  30 d as being a supercycle. They also identified that normal outbursts with amplitudes of <  1 mag every few days. Here we report an argument against this interpretation.

Firstly, a supercycle of ER UMa-type dwarf novae is largely occupied by a long-lasting superoutburst [\citep=kat99erumareview]. A superoutburst comprises 30-45% of a supercycle (cf. [\citealt=rob95eruma]; [\citealt=kat01v1159ori]). The outbursts occurring every ~  30 d last only less than a few days (see Fig. 1), amount to a duty cycle of only ~  0.1. Furthermore, no superhumps, which are always seen during ER UMa-type superoutbursts, have yet been observed during these outbursts (S. Kiyota, private communication; the observations on 1999 May 12 and 13 by [\citet=mat00v893sco] were also done during one of these outbursts, and no signature of superhumps was observed). These outbursts bear all characteristics of normal outbursts rather than those of superoutbursts.

Secondly, what were referred to as outbursts with amplitudes of <  1 mag every few days in [\citet=mas01v893sco] is not evident as shown in Figure 2. Both visual and CCD observations show only irregular variations which are frequently met in CVs. Period analysis yielded not significant periodicity. The presence of such strong quiescent variations in V893 Sco was also independently confirmed by [\citet=bru00v893sco]. These variations can to be better understood as an enhanced activity sometimes observed in high-inclination systems [\citep=kat01v2051ophiyuma].

From these findings, we conclude that V893 Sco bears no similar characters with ER UMa stars, and that the arguments in [\citet=mas01v893sco] need to be reconsidered.
