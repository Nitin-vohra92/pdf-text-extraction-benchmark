Introduction

After many years of preparation, the LHC has tested in very significant ways the Higgs sector of the SM. In fact the LHC announcement of the discovery of a new boson, with properties that resemble those of the SM Higgs boson can be considered a great triumph of particle physics. The new boson has a mass [formula] [\cite=CMS-bsn:2012gu] [\cite=ATLAS-bsn:2012gk], which agrees quite well with the range preferred by the analysis of electroweak precision tests. The LHC has also searched for new physics beyond the SM, and so far only has extended the bounds on the new physics scale.

Some of the simplest extensions of the SM are those that add new gauge bosons, which could arise from a variety of contexts, ranging from simple extra U(1) gauge symmetries [\cite=Pati:1974yy], left-right models [\cite=Pati:1974yy] [\cite=Mohapatra:1974hk] [\cite=Mohapatra:1980yp] [\cite=Mohapatra:1979ia], GUTs [\cite=Kane:1998hz], and even string theory [\cite=Cvetic:1995rj] [\cite=Cvetic:1996mf] [\cite=Cleaver:1998sm]. In particular, extension of the SM with an extra U(1)' have been studied extensively, including the detection at LHC, as well as other phenomenological aspects [\cite=Pati:1974yy] [\cite=Mohapatra:1974hk] [\cite=Mohapatra:1980yp] [\cite=Mohapatra:1979ia] [\cite=Kane:1998hz] [\cite=Cvetic:1995rj] [\cite=Cvetic:1996mf] [\cite=Cleaver:1998sm].

The crucial test for this kind of models is precisely the presence of new Z' gauge boson, and recent bounds from LHC indicate that it should be heavier than about [formula][\cite=langacker-09] [\cite=Diener:2009vq] [\cite=Hsieh:2010zr]. Future LHC runs at 13-14 TeV will increase the Z' mass bounds or luckily will find evidence of its presence. Further studies will require a new linear collider, which will also allow us to perform precision studies of the Higgs sector, in order to search for the nature of the Higgs mechanism at more fundamental level.

The Higgs boson from these models could be searched using mechanisms similar to the SM one. However, the existence of such new gauge bosons could also provide new Higgs production mechanisms, which could probe its non-standard origin. In this paper we are interested in studying how the Z' from a model with extra U(1)', could be used as a source of Higgs bosons. We calculate the decay widths for the 3-body decays of the Z' into a Higgs boson, namely for Z'  →  th,WWh. We find that it is possible to get [formula]'s as high as 10- 2 for these modes, which could be studied at LHC. We also calculate the production of the Higgs bosons in association with the Z vector boson at a linear collider, i.e. e+e-  →  Z,Z'  →  Z + h, with Z' either on-shell or off-shell.

The organization of this paper goes as follows: section 2 contains a summary of the U(1)B - L model with extra Z'. Then, section 3 includes the calculation of the 3-body decays of Z' into a Higgs boson and a pair of SM particles, Z'  →  th,WWh. Section 4 contains our calculation of e+e-  →  Z,Z'  →  Z + h, while Section 5 includes our conclusions. Some of the lenghtly formulae appearing in the calculation of the 3-body decays are included in the appendices.

A U(1)B - L model with extra Z': parameters and bounds

In this section we will describe the Lagrangian, including the gauge and fermionic sectors for SU(2)L   ×   U(1)Y   ×   U(1)' model, we also write the Higgs potential and the Higgs coupling. The gauge sector is given by[\cite=Ferroglia:2006mj] [\cite=Rizzo:2006nw],

[formula]

We ignore the SU(3) sector for the purposes of the paper. The field strength tensor are labeled as Waμν,Bμν and Z'μν for SU(2)L,U(1)Y and U(1)', respectively. We need to transform eq.[\eqref=eq:Lagr-gral-Uup-gauge-states] in order to obtain the physical mass eigenstates [\cite=Foot:1991kb] [\cite=Babu:1997st].

For the scalar sector we have,

[formula]

where Φ denotes the SM scalar doublet and χ is a singlet under the SM. The covariant derivate for a pure B - L model is [\cite=Basso:2010pe] [\cite=Basso-Moretti-Pruna-2010] [\cite=Basso:2010jm],

[formula]

The doublet and singlet scalars are further written as,

[formula]

In this way, G±,GZ and z' become the Goldstone bosons of W±,Z and Z', respectively. The potential that does this is [\cite=Basso:2010jm],

[formula]

After SSB we obtain the mass matrix for the neutral CP-even states, φ0 and φ'0. Then, we need to diagonalize this mass matrix to obtain the mass eigenstates, i.e.

[formula]

Where α is the mixing angle for the neutral Higgs bosons. However in order to respect the recent constraints from LHC on the Higgs couplings[\cite=CMS-bsn:2012gu] [\cite=ATLAS-bsn:2012gk] we shall fix the mixing angle to be cos α≃1, i.e. h≃φ0.

The couplings of a Z' boson to the SM fermions are given by, where [formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

As it is given in the SM [formula] Similarly, in the forthcoming calculations we will use the following definitions the couplings for gauge and neutral Higgs bosons which are shown in table ([\ref=ta:ver-bos-higgs-fermio]).

and

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] The Z - Z' mixing angle is taken as θ'  =  10- 3 (θ'  =  10- 4) which respects the currents bounds on this parameter[\cite=beringer-pdg-2012]. According to recent LHC results we must take [formula] for the SM-like Higgs boson, the vacuum expectation value is taken as [formula] We took the value [formula] for the Higgs mixing parameter, which is in the agreement with [\cite=CMS-bsn:2012gu] [\cite=ATLAS-bsn:2012gk] [\cite=Chakraborty:2013si].

Three body decays: Z'  →  th,W+W-h

In the following we present the formulae for the 3-body decays of the Z' that include a Higgs boson in the final state, namely for the modes Z'  →  th and Z'  →  WWh. Since the dominant two-body decay modes are needed in order to calculate the corresponding branching ratios ([formula]), we shall also present the explicit expressions for the corresponding decay widths.

Two-body modes

The dominant decays of Z' includes the decay into a fermion pair (Z'  →  f), gauge boson pair (Z'  →  W+W-) and into a higgs and a Z boson (Z'  →  Zh). The decay width for Z'  →  W+W- process is given by[\cite=Leike:1998wr]:

[formula]

where gZ'WW is include in table ([\ref=ta:ver-bos-higgs-fermio]) and [formula]

The decays width for Z'  →  f is given by[\cite=Ferroglia:2006mj] [\cite=Leike:1998wr]:

[formula]

The coefficients g'fV,A are the couplings that appear in eqs. ([\ref=eq:gV-gA-SM-ext]) and [formula]

Finally, the decay width for the mode Z'  →  Zh is given by[\cite=Abe:2011qe]:

[formula]

where ghZZ' is shown in table ([\ref=ta:ver-bos-higgs-fermio]), [formula] and [formula]

In general, we shall use the following notation: ri  =  m2i / M2Z' and rij  =  m2i / M2j.

Z'  →  fh

The amplitud for the decay Z'  →  fh procceds through the following Feynman diagrams, The corresponding invariant amplitud is given by,

[formula]

By performing the calculations, we obtain the following result for the differential decay width:

[formula]

the integration limits for the scaled energy variables (x,y)  =  (2Eh / MZ',2Ef / MZ') are,

[formula]

where [formula] and C  =  (1  -  x  +  rh). The expressions for the functions f1,f2,f3,f12,f13,f23 are shown in Appendix [\ref=ap:ap-m1m2m3].

Z'  →  W+W-h

The Feynman diagrams that contribute to the decay Z'  →  W+W-h are shown next: We have performed the calculation similarly to the last subsection, including the interference terms. The resulting differential decay width is written as:

[formula]

for the definition of f4,5,45 see the Appendix [\ref=ap:ap-m4m5]. The definitions for (x,y) and their integration limits, are similar to the last calculation, with xf  →  xW.

Results for Br's

The recent LHC results indicate that the Higgs boson mass is mh≃125 GeV [\cite=CMS-bsn:2012gu] [\cite=ATLAS-bsn:2012gk] [\cite=erler-2012], which is the nominal value we use in the following plots. We show the Branching ratio for different channels as a function of the Z' gauge boson mass. We consider the B - L scenarios for the fermion-Z' couplings, with θ'  =  10- 3 (θ'  =  10- 4).

We can see from figure [\ref=fig:Br-GF-vp-1TeV] that the [formula] is not dominant, because this process depends on the coupling gZ'WW (eq.[\eqref=eq:Zp-WMWm]) which decreases with θ'. For the [formula] and [formula] the global factor coming from the denominator in the second process is about ten times larger than the one appearing in the first process, such that: [formula] The decay Z'  →  th depends directly on the couplings g'V and g'A, in this case we use g1  ~  g'. The Z'  →  WW depends directly on θ'2  ~  1  ×  10- 6, so this is suppresed too. The Z'  →  WWh process depends on the product gZ'WWgWWh and it inversely proportional too, in such way that as MZ' grows then the corresponding width grows too. We have performed the calculation similarly to the last subsection, including the interference terms. The resulting differential decay width is written as:

[formula]

for the definition of f4,5,45 see the Appendix [\ref=ap:ap-m4m5]. The definitions for (x,y) and their integration limits, are similar to the last calculation, with xf  →  xW.

We notice that there is a decrease in the decays Z'  →  WW,WWh, whereas the decay Z'  →  ff,tth remmain essentially constant.

The reaction e+e-  →  Z',Z*  →  Z + h at ILC

In this section we study the Higgs production at e+e- colliders, through the reaction e+e-  →  Z,Z'  →  Zh, taking into account the contribution of resonant (Z') and non-resonant effects (Z). When [formula] one expectes that the production of Z + h is dominated by the decay Z'  →  Zh, however the vertex ZZ'h is suppressed by the mxiing angle θ', and therefore it is interesting to study the contribution from the non-resonant amplitude.

The Feynman diagrams for the reaction are shown in fig. [\ref=fd:fd-ee-Zp-Zh],

the total amplitud is: M  =  M1  +  M2. Where,

[formula]

The resulting cross section is given by,

[formula]

where RfZ  =  (4 - 32rf)rZ + 1, ~  ~ TfZ = 4(4rf + 1)rZ + 1, ~  ~ cr  =  1 - rZ, ~  ~ c'r  =  1 - rZ' and gZff, and ghZZ' appear in eq. ([\ref=eq:gV-gA-SM]) and in table ([\ref=ta:ver-bos-higgs-fermio]). In this section, we have used [formula] and [formula] The gV,A'(gV,A) are the Z'ff(Zff) couplings that appear in eq.[\eqref=eq:L-Zff].

We can see from the fig. [\ref=fig:proces-resonan], that when [formula] the resonant effect dominates the Higgs production, despite the fact that the coupling ZZ'h is suppresed.

Conclusions

Models containing an extra gauge boson often include a rich spectrum of Higgs bosons, with properties that deviate from the Standard Model (SM) case. Such Higgs bosons could be searched using standard mechanisms, similar to the SM. However, the existence of such new gauge bosons could also be used to provide new production mechanisms, which could probe the non-standard origin of the Higgs couplings.

In this paper we have studied how the Z' arising from a model with a extra U(1)' could be used as a source of Higgs bosons. For such a task, we concentrate in the Z'  →  th channel, and we found a Br for this mode 10- 2 far a wide range of the parameter space, which could be within the reach for both accelerators LHC and ILC. To appreciate the importance of the resonant effect for Higgs production one can see the fig.[\ref=fig:proces-resonan] when γ is significant.

Further, at the next linear collider (ILC) one could achieve luminosites [formula] at [formula] [\cite=Simon:2012ik] [\cite=Jiang:2012bf], which could give a number of events: [formula] which seems feasible to be detected and it will be possible to perform precision measurements for Z' and Higgs. In models with an extra Higgs doublet, it could be possible to get larger coulings of the Higgs boson with b-quarks, and this will also allow to study the decay Z'  →  bbh, which could be detactable even at LHC [\cite=Balazs:1998nt].
