For 2 < n + 1 < m, [formula] is not finitely axiomatizable

The class of neat reducts has been extensively studied by the author, Andréka, Németi, Hirsch, Hodkinson, Ferenzci and others. In this note we show that for 1 < n < m, the class [formula] is psuedo-elementary (it is known that it is not closed under ultraroots Ur [\cite=MLQ]), and that for 2 < n + 1 < m < ω, the class [formula] is not finitely axiomatizabe. For our first result we use a defining theory in two sorts when both n and m are finite, three sorts when n is finite and m is infinite, and four sorts when both mand n are infinite. For our second result we use Monk-like algebras constructed by Robin Hirsch.

Let 1 < n < m, then the class [formula] is pseudo-elementary, but is not elementary. Furthermore, [formula]is recursively enumerable, and for n > 2, and m  ≥  2, [formula] is not finitely axiomatizable.

From the above proof it follows that

Let K be any class such that [formula]. Then ELK is not finitely axiomatizable

For α infinite, and k∈ω there is [formula]

Let [formula] be as consrtucted above, then we also have: For m < n and k  ≥  1, there exists [formula] such that [formula] Let α be an infinite ordinal, let X be any finite subset of α, let I = {Γ:X  ⊆  Γ  ⊆  α,  |Γ| < ω}. For each Γ∈I let MΓ  =  {Δ∈I:Δ  ⊇  Γ} and let F be any ultrafilter over I such that for all Γ∈I we have MΓ∈F (such an ultrafilter exists because [formula]). For each Γ∈I let ρΓ be a bijection from |Γ| onto Γ. For each Γ∈I let [formula] be [formula]-type algebras. For each Γ∈I we have [formula] then [formula].

Furthermore, if [formula], for each Γ∈I then [formula].

Let k∈ω. Let α be an infinite ordinal. Then [formula] Let r∈ω. Let I = {Γ:Γ  ⊆  α,|Γ| < ω}. For each Γ∈I, let MΓ  =  {Δ∈I:Γ  ⊆  Δ}, and let F be an ultrafilter on I such that [formula]. For each Γ∈I, let ρΓ be a one to one function from |Γ| onto Γ. Let [formula] be an algebra similar to [formula] such that

[formula]

Let

[formula]

We will prove that

[formula] and

[formula].

The theorem will follow, since [formula].

For the first part, for each Γ∈I we know that [formula] and [formula]. Let σΓ be a one to one function (|Γ| + k)  →  (α + k) such that ρΓ  ⊆  σΓ and σΓ(|Γ| + i) = α + i for every i < k. Let [formula] be an algebra similar to a [formula] such that [formula]. By the second part with α + k in place of α, [formula] in place of X, {Γ  ⊆  α + k:|Γ| < ω,  X  ⊆  Γ} in place of I, and with σΓ in place of ρΓ, we know that [formula].

We prove that [formula]. Recall that [formula] and note that CrΓ  ⊆  AΓ (the base of CrΓ is [formula], the base of AΓ is [formula]). So, for each Γ∈I,

[formula]

By the first part of the first part we deduce that [formula], proving [\eqref=en:1].

Now we prove [\eqref=en:2]. For this assume, seeking a contradiction, that [formula], [formula], where [formula]. Let 3  ≤  m < ω and λ:m + k + 1  →  α + k + 1 be the function defined by λ(i) = i for i < m and λ(m + i) = α + i for i < k + 1. Then [formula] and [formula]. For each Γ∈I, let I|Γ| be an isomorphism

[formula]

Let x = (x|Γ|:Γ) / F and let ι(b) = (I|Γ|b:Γ) / F for [formula]. Then ι is an isomorphism from [formula] into [formula]. Then [formula]. It follows that [formula] which is a contradiction and we are done.
