Cellular categories

Introduction

We introduce cellular categories as categories equipped with a class of morphisms containing all isomorphisms and closed under pushout and transfinite composite (= transfinite composition). The special case is a category equipped with a weak factorization system, which includes categories equipped with a factorization system. The latter categories are called "structured " in [\cite=AHS]. Cellular categories are abundant in homotopy theory because any Quillen model category carries two weak factorization systems, i.e., two cellular structures given by cofibrations and trivial cofibrations, resp. There are also various concepts of "cofibration categories" equipped with cofibrations and weak equivalences (see [\cite=RB] for a recent survey). One can do homotopy theory in any category equipped with a weak factorization system because we have cylinder objects and hence homotopies there (see [\cite=KR]). Cellular category does not need to have weak factorizations - for example pure monomorphisms in certain locally finitely presentable categories (see [\cite=BR]). However, in a locally presentable category, one always has weak factorizations whenever cellular morphism are generated by a set of morphisms. The left part of the corresponding factorization system consists of retracts of cellular morphisms. In harmony with the J. Smith's concept of a combinatorial model category, we call such cellular categories combinatorial.

Our main result is that combinatorial cellular categories are closed under constructions of limit type. Like for locally presentable (or accessible categories) these limits should be defined in the framework of 2-categories and they can be reduced to products, inserters and equifiers (see [\cite=MP] and [\cite=AR]). These limits are called PIE-limits. The consequence is that they include both lax limits and pseudolimits. It turns out that the key step is the closedness under pseudopullbacks and the key ingredience is the use of good colimits introduced by Lurie [\cite=L] and futher developed by the first author in [\cite=M]. Lurie used good colimits for lifting cellular structure to functor categories, which is a limit type construction.

Our starting point is [\cite=MRV] and we are using notation from that paper. Among others, the present paper links combinatorial cellular categories with deconstructible classes of objects in Grothendieck abelian categories (see [\cite=G], [\cite=EAPT], [\cite=S], [\cite=SS] and [\cite=Be]) where good colimits are replaced by generalized Hill lemma. Our limit theorem for combinatorial cellular categories implies some limit theorems for deconstructible classes proved in [\cite=S] and [\cite=Be].

Combinatorial categories

Morphisms belonging to C are called cellular and C will be often denoted as [formula]. Given a class X of morphisms of a cocomplete category K then [formula] denotes the closure of X under pushout and transfinite composite. In fact, [formula] consists of transfinite composites of pushouts of morphisms from X. We say that the cellular category [formula] is cellularly generated by X. In a cellular category K, let

[formula]

consist of retracts of cellular morphisms in the category K2 of morphisms of K. Elements of this class are called cofibrations.

Let K be a cellular category. Then [formula] is a cellular category.

It is easy to see that [formula] is closed under pushout. Let f0:A0  →  A1 and f1:A1  →  A2 be two composable cofibrations. Following [\cite=MRV] 2.1(5), there are cellular morphisms g0:A0  →  B1, h1:A1  →  C2 and morphisms u1:A1  →  B1, r1:B1  →  A1, v2:A2  →  C2, s2:C2  →  A2 such that u1, r1 make f0 a retract of g0 in [formula] and v2, s2 make f1 a retract of h1 in [formula]. Consider a pushout

[formula]

Since h1r1u1 = h1 = v2f1, there is the unique morphism t:B2  →  C2 such that tg1 = h1r1 and tu2 = v2. It is easy to see that u2 and s2t make f1 a retract of g1. Thus f1f0 is a retract of g1g0. Consequently, cofibrations are closed under transfinite composite.

We say that a cellular category K is retract closed if [formula]. Following [\ref=le2.2], [formula] is a reflection of a cellular category K into retract closed cellular categories.

Given a set of morphisms in a cocomplete category K then [formula] denotes the closure of X under pushout, transfinite composite and retract. In fact, [formula] consists of retracts of transfinite composites of pushouts of morphisms from X. We say that [formula] is cofibrantly generated by X.

In a combinatorial category K, the class of cofibrations forms a left part of a weak factorization system. Following [\cite=L] A.1.5.12, any combinatorial category is cellularly generated by a set of morphisms.

An object K is called cofibrant if the unique morphism 0  →  K from an initial object is a cofibration. Analogously we define cellular objects.

A morphism (u,v):g  →  f in K2 will be called a pushout morphism if the square

[formula]

is a pushouts. Let [formula] be the subcategory of K2 with the objects as K2 and with the pushout morphisms.

Let K be a locally κ-presentable category and X a set of morphisms between κ-presentable objects. Then the full subcategory of [formula] on objects belonging to [formula] is locally κ-presentable with [formula] being the full subcategory of κ-presentable objects.

Our category is clearly cocomplete with colimits calculated in K2 and objects from [formula] are κ-presentable. Thus it suffices to prove that any morphism in [formula] is a κ-directed colimit in [formula] of morphisms belonging to [formula].

Let f:A  →  B be a morphism in [formula]. Thus there is a pushout

[formula]

where g∈X. We can express A as a κ-directed colimit (hi:Ai  →  A)i∈I of κ-presentable objects. Let (hij:Ai  →  Aj)i  ≤  j∈I denote the corresponding diagram. Since X is κ-presentable, there is a factorization

[formula]

for some i∈I. Let uj = hijui for i  ≤  j∈I. Form pushouts

[formula]

We get the diagram

[formula]

where the lower square and the outer rectangle are pushouts and kj is the induced morphism. Thus the upper square is the pushout. Hence f is a κ-directed colimit in [formula] of morphisms gj:Aj  →  Bj belonging to [formula].

For a class X of arrows in a given cocomplete category K, and an ordinal λ, let us denote by λ-[formula] the category whose objects are the smooth chains in K of length λ, and whose links are in X. Recall that these are the chains (aij:Ai  →  Aj)i  ≤  j < λ such that (aij:Ai  →  Aj)i < j is a colimit for any limit ordinal j < λ and ai,i + 1∈X for each i + 1  <  λ. A morphism (hi):(aij)  →  (bij) of smooth chains will be called a pushout morphism if all squares

[formula]

are pushouts. Note that the smoothness implies that it is sufficient to require the condition for j = i + 1. Let λ-[formula] be the subcategory of λ-[formula] with the objects as λ-[formula] and with the pushout morphisms. In particular, 1-[formula]-[formula], 2-[formula] and 2-[formula]. By recursion, we can generalize [\ref=le2.5] to any ordinal 0 < λ  <  κ:

Let K be a locally κ-presentable category, X a set of morphisms between κ-presentable objects and 0 < λ  <  κ an ordinal. Then any chain in λ-[formula] is a κ-directed colimit in λ-[formula] of chains belonging to λ-[formula].

This statement can be used for proving the following result:

Let K be a locally κ-presentable category and X a set of morphisms between κ-presentable objects. Then

[formula]

This result was proved in [\cite=MRV] 4.20 using good colimits.

Limits of combinatorial categories

A functor F:K  →  L between cellular categories will be called cellular if it preserves colimits and cellular morphisms. We will denote [formula] the (illegitimate) 2-category of categories, functors and natural transformations and [formula] the (illegitimate) 2-category of cellular categories, cellular functors and natural transformations. The forgetful 2-functor [formula] has both a left 2-adjoint given by discrete cellular structures and a right 2-adjoint given by trivial ones. In particular, U preserves all existing 2-limits. We are not really interested in 2-limits in [formula] but, for what follows, it is instructive to calculate pseudopullbacks.

We recall that a pseudopullback of functors F and G is a square in [formula]

[formula]

which commutes up to an isomorphism and has the 2-categorical universal property among such squares. Objects of the category P are triples (K,L,t) where t:FK  →  GL is an isomorphism and morphisms (K1,L1,t1)  →  (K2,L2,t2) are pairs (u,v) where u:K1  →  K2, v:L1  →  L2 such that t2F(u) = G(v)t1. The functors [formula], [formula] are the projections and t's yield the desired natural isomorphism F  →  G.

Given C  ⊆  K2 and D  ⊆  L2, we get the class

[formula]

of morphisms in P.

[formula] has pseudopullbacks.

Let F:K  →  M and G:L  →  M be cellular functors. It suffices to put

[formula]

We will denote [formula] the 2-category of locally presentable categories, colimit preserving functors and natural transformations. This is a legitimate category which is not locally small. Recall that any colimit preserving functor between locally presentable categories has a left adjoint. [formula] has all PIE-limits, which means products, inserters and equifiers. Consequently, it has all pseudolimits, in particular it has pseudopullbacks. This basic result was proved in [\cite=Bi] and follows from a more general limit theorem for accessible categories (see [\cite=MP]) where one can find all needed concepts (see also [\cite=AR]).

A functor F:K  →  L between combinatorial categories will be called combinatorial if it preserves colimits and cofibrations. [formula] will denote the 2-category of combinatorial categories, combinatorial functors and natural transformations. Again, this category is legitimate but not locally small and the forgetful 2-functor [formula] has both a left 2-adjoint and right 2-adjoint given by discrete and trivial combinatorial structures. Thus V preserves all existing 2-limits. Moreover [formula] is a full sub-2-category of [formula].

Consider a pseudopullback in [formula]

[formula]

where F and G are combinatorial functors. We have to show that P is combinatorial, i.e., that [formula] is cofibrantly generated by a set of morphisms.

There is an uncountable regular cardinal κ such that the categories K,L,M are locally κ-presentable, both [formula] and [formula] are cofibrantly generated by morphisms between κ-presentable objects, P is locally κ-presentable and the functors [formula] preserve κ-filtered colimits and κ-presentable objects. Following [\cite=L] A.1.5.12, both [formula] and [formula] are cellularly generated by morphisms between κ-presentable objects. Let X consist of morphisms f between κ-presentable objects in P such that [formula] and [formula]. We will prove that

[formula]

which proves the theorem. Let [formula] denote cofibrations between κ-presentable objects in K and the same for [formula]. Then

[formula]

Thus it suffices to prove the equations

[formula]

In the first equation, the right-hand side is obviously included in the left-hand side. Let e belong to the left-hand side of the first equation. Following [\cite=MRV] 4.11, there are κ-good κ-directed diagrams D:P  →  K and E:Q  →  L with links in [formula] and [formula] resp. such that [formula] is the composite of E and [formula] is the composite of D. Thus there are isomorphisms u and v in M such that the square

[formula]

commutes. In what follows, [formula] and [formula] are colimit cocones. We can assume that neither P nor Q have the greatest element.

Let P̃ denote the set of all non-empty initial segments X of P. For each X∈P̃, we get the induced morphism [formula] where DX denotes the restriction of D on X. Analogously, we have [formula] for Y∈. Given X∈P̃ and x∈P, let [formula]. We are going to show that X  ≠  P implies X(x)  ≠  P. Since P is directed and does not have the greatest element, there is x < y∈P. Clearly, either y∉X(x) or X(x) = X.

By recursion on all ordinals i and j, i < j, we will construct smooth chains Xi  ⊆  Xj in P̃, Yi  ⊆  Yj in [formula] and

[formula]

in P such that each Ki is a colimit of the restriction of D on an initial segment Xi∈P̃, each Li is a colimit of the restriction of E on an initial segment Yi∈, kij:Ki  →  Li, lij:Li  →  Lj are the induced morhisms, and, for the induced morphisms [formula], [formula], the square

[formula]

commutes. The construction will terminate at the ordinal k when both Xk = P and Yk = Q become true. It follows easily from [\cite=MRV] 4.19 that each morphism kij is in [formula], and similarly [formula], thus the smooth chain (kij,lij)i  ≤  j < k has links in [formula]. In this way we get that e belongs to the right-hand side of the first equation.

We put [formula], [formula] and u0 = u. Let us have (Ki,Li,ui). If Xi = P and Yi = Q, we are finished, and we put k = i. Otherwise, either Yi  ≠  Q, or Xi  ≠  P. Assume the first case, the second is handled symmetrically. Choose y1∈Q - Yi and put Yi1 = Yi(y1), [formula]. Following [\cite=MRV] 4.19, the induced morphism s0:Li  →  Li1 belongs to [formula]. Let

[formula]

be a corresponding pushout with [formula]. Since GB is κ-presentable and P κ-directed, there is x0∈P and

[formula]

such that v- 1G(εYi1)G(b) = F(δx0)f. We obtain the morphisms

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since

[formula]

[formula] is a κ-directed colimit cocone and GA is κ-presentable, there is x0  ≤  x1∈P such that the morphisms

[formula]

and

[formula]

satisfy g1G(h) = g2G(a). We put Xi1 = X(x1), [formula] and ui1:GLi1  →  FKi1 is the induced morphism from the pushout defining GLi1. Following [\cite=MRV] 4.19, the induced morphism t0:Ki  →  Ki1 belongs to [formula]. We have ui1G(s0)ui = F(t0) and v- 1G(εYi1) = F(δXi1)ui1.

Now, in the same way as above, we get initial segments Xi2∈P̃ and Yi2∈, the objects [formula] and [formula] and morphisms t1:Ki1  →  Ki2 in [formula], s1:Li1  →  Li2 in [formula] and ui2:FKi2  →  GLi2 such that vF(δXi2) = G(εYi2)ui2 and ui2F(t1)ui1 = G(s1). We have

[formula]

Continuing this procedure, we get morphisms uin with alternating directions, whose squares with v or v- 1 commute and all squares between uin's for odd n and between uin's for even n commute. We put [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Clearly, ui + 1 is an isomorphism; its inverse is [formula].

The construction of the items at stage i for i a limit ordinal is dictated by the smoothness requirements. Clearly, there is an ordinal k where the construction stops: Xk = P and Yk = Q. Since now fk is the identity on [formula], and similarly for gk, it follows that uk = v. Thus e is the composite of the diagram (kij,lij)i < k  ≤  k as desired.

The second equation is the consequence of

[formula]

In this equation, the right-hand side is obviously contained in the left-hand side. Let e belong to the left-hand side. Then [formula] is a pushout of a morphism from [formula] and [formula] is is a pushout of a morphism from [formula]. There are isomorphisms u and v in M such that the square

[formula]

commutes.

Following [\ref=le2.5], [formula] is a κ-directed colimit in [formula] of morphisms from [formula] and [formula] is a κ-directed colimit in [formula] of morphisms from [formula]. Let g0:L10  →  L20 be a morphism from [formula], [formula] a morphism in [formula], f0:K10  →  K20 a morphism from [formula] and [formula] a morphism in [formula]. There is a morphism g1:L11  →  L21 from [formula] and a morphism [formula] with factorizations

[formula]

and

[formula]

There is a morphism f1:K11  →  K21 from [formula] and a morphism [formula] with factorizations

[formula]

and

[formula]

We continue this procedure and take colimits of the resulting chains [formula] and [formula]. Since Gg and Ff are isomorphic, we get a morphism e' from [formula] and a pushout morphism e'  →  e. Therefore e belongs to [formula].

Products of combinatorial categories are evident:

[formula]

Let F,G:K  →  L be combinatorial functors, φ,ψ:F  →  G natural transformations and [formula] their equifier in [formula]. Consider a pseudopullback

[formula]

where [formula] is the full embedding. Then P is an equifier of φ and ψ in [formula].

Finally, let F,G:K  →  L be combinatorial functors and [formula] their inserter in [formula]. Consider a pseudopullback

[formula]

where [formula] is the forgetful functor. Then P is an inserter of F and G in [formula].

Clearly, all PIE-limits above are calculated in [formula].

The consequence is that [formula] has pseudolimits and lax limits (calculated in [formula]). The same is true for [formula]. Another consequence is [\cite=L] 2.8.3 (see [\cite=M] as well).

The cotensor

[formula]

can be constructed using PIE-limits, [\ref=cor3.3] implies that

[formula]

Let K be a Grothendieck abelian category and C a class of objects in K. A C-monomorphism is a monomorphism whose cokernel belongs to C. The class C-[formula] of these monomorphisms makes K a cellular category. Cellular objects here are precisely C-filtered objects, i.e., objects K such that the morphism 0  →  K is a transfinite composite of C-monomorphisms. A class C is deconstructible if it is a class of S-filtered objects for a set S. The fundamental fact (basically due to [\cite=SS]) is that C is deconstructible if and only if the cellular category (K,C-[formula] is combinatorial.

Let C be deconstructible and [formula] be the category of complexes over K. Since it is a functor category, [\ref=cor3.4] implies that [formula] is combinatorial with respect to pointwise C-monomorhisms. Consequently the class [formula] of complexes with components in C is deconstructible, which was proved in [\cite=S] 4.2 (1) using generalized Hill lemma.

Let T:K  →  K be a colimit preserving monad on a combinatorial category K and [formula] the forgetful functor from the category of T-algebras. Then [formula] is locally presentable (see [\cite=AR] Remark 2.78) and U preserves colimits (see [\cite=Bo] 4.3.2). Thus [formula] is a combinatorial category where f is a cofibration if and only if Uf is a cofibration.

The combinatorial category [formula] is given by a pseudopullback

[formula]

Let T:K  →  K be a colimit preserving monad on a Grothendieck abelian category and C a deconstructible class of objects in K. Then the class of T-algebras A with UA∈C is deconstructible in T-[formula]. This result was proved in [\cite=Be] A.7 and follows from [\ref=cor3.6] and [\ref=re3.5].

More generally, let F:K  →  L be a colimit preserving functor from a locally presentable category K to a combinatorial category L. In the same way as above, we get a combinatorial structure on K where f is a cofibration if and only if Ff is a cofibration. We have a pseudopullback

[formula]

In accordance with [\cite=HS] 4.1, we call this combinatorial structure left-induced from L.

Let us observe that both equifiers and inserters are given as left-induced structures. Since PIE-limits yield all pseudolimits, we could prove only the special case of [\ref=th3.2] giving the existence of left-induced structures.

Limits of combinatorial model categories

Any combinatorial model category K has two underlying combinatorial categories W1(K) = (K,C) and W2(K) = (K,C0) where C is the class of cofibrations of K and C0 is the class of trivial cofibrations. On every locally presentable category K there is a trivial combinatorial model structure Ktm such that both W1(Ktm) and W2(Ktm) are trivial combinatorial categories and a discrete combinatorial model structure Kdm such that both W1(Kdm) and W2(Kdm) are discrete combinatorial categories. Weak equivalences are all morphisms in the both cases. More generally, any combinatorial category K yields a combinatorial model category m(K) such that Wi(m(K)) = K for i = 1,2. Again, any morphism of K is a weak equivalence in m(K). In particular, Ktm = m(Kt) and Kdm = m(Kd) .

Let [formula] denote the category of combinatorial model categories and left Quillen functors. We get the functors

[formula]

W2 preserves pseudopullbacks existing in [formula].

It follows from the fact that [formula] is left adjoint to W2.

We know that

[formula]

We will show that W1 does not need to preserve existing pseudopullbacks.

We do not know whether [formula] has pseudopullbacks.

(1) The existence of pseudopullbacks would imply the existence of PIE-limits in [formula]. Since products of combinatorial model categories exist and are preserved by W1 and W2, PIE-limits can be obtained from pseudopullbacks of the kind

[formula]

like in [\ref=cor3.4]. Following [\ref=le4.1], f is a trivial cofibration in K if and only if Ff is a trivial cofibration. If the same holds for cofibrations then K is left-induced in the sense of [\cite=HS].

(2) In particular, the existence of pseudopullbacks would imply the existence of lax limits in [formula]. But Barwick proved that they always exist and are preserved not only by W2 but also by W1 ([\cite=Ba] 2.30).
