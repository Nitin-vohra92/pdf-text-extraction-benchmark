Spectral gap actions and invariant states

Introduction

In this paper, Γ is a discrete group, K is a (complex) Hilbert space and π is a unitary representation of Γ on K. We denote by 1Γ the one dimensional trivial representation of Γ, and Kπ the set of π-invariant vectors in K. Recall that (see [\cite=BC]) π is said to have a spectral gap if the restriction of π on the orthogonal complement [formula] does not weakly contain 1Γ (in the sense of Fell), i.e. there does not exist a net of unit vectors [formula] satisfying [formula] for every t∈Γ.

The following result on group actions, which relates the existence of spectral gap of certain representation and the uniqueness of the invariant states (means), is crucial to the solution of the Banach-Ruziewicz problem (see [\cite=Marg],[\cite=Sull],[\cite=Drin]).

Motivated by this result we will define spectral gap actions of discrete groups on von Neumann algebras, and study the corresponding invariant states on the von Neumann algebras.

From now on, N is a von Neumann algebra with standard form [formula], i.e. [formula] is a Hilbert space, [formula] is a conjugate linear bijective isometry, and [formula] is a self-dual cone in [formula] such that there is a (forgettable) faithful representation of N on [formula] satisfying some compatibility conditions with [formula] and [formula]. The readers may find in [\cite=Haag-st-form] more information on this topic. As proved in [\cite=Haag-st-form], there exists a unique unitary representation U of the *-automorphism group Aut(N) on [formula] such that

[formula]

Hence, an action α of Γ on N gives rise to a unitary representation [formula] of Γ on [formula].

We will study the relationship between spectral gap actions and standard actions of discrete groups on von Neumann algebras. This is the main topic of Section 2. Our first main result generalizes Theorem [\ref=motivation](a) to the situation of discrete group actions on von Neumann algebras.

In contrast to Theorem [\ref=motivation](b), the converse statement of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] is not true in general (see Example [\ref=eg:4-not-2](b)). Nevertheless, we will give several situations in which the converse does hold (see e.g. Proposition [\ref=prop:inv-mean-sp-gap-act](b)). Let us also note that Theorem [\ref=motivation] (and hence Theorem [\ref=thm:main]) does not extend to locally compact groups. Indeed, if G is the circle group (equipped with the canonical compact topology) and N: = L∞(G) with the left translation action α by G, then there is a unique normal α-invariant state on N, but there exist more than one α-invariant states (see e.g. [\cite=Lub]).

We will give two applications of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. The first one concerns inner amenability and will be considered in Section 3. The notion of inner amenability was first introduced by Effros, aiming to give a group theoretic description of property Gamma of the group von Neumann algebra L(Γ) of an ICC group. Recall that that Γ is an ICC group if Γ  ≠  {e} and all the non-trivial conjugacy classes of Γ are infinite. Moreover, Γ is inner amenable if there exist more than one inner invariant states on [formula]. Effros showed in [\cite=Eff] that a countable ICC group Γ is inner amenable if L(Γ) has property Gamma. However, Vaes recently gave, in [\cite=Vaes], a counter example to the converse. From an opposite angle, it is natural to ask whether one can express inner amenability of Γ in terms of certain property of L(Γ). One application of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] is the following result.

We will also study an alternative generalization of inner amenability (which is called "strongly inner amenability") of (not necessarily ICC) discrete groups, which is of independent interest.

Section 4 is concerned with our second application, which is related to property (T). Recall that Γ is said to have property (T) if every unitary representation of Γ has a spectral gap. It follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:main] that if Γ has property (T), then every action of Γ on a von Neumann algebra is standard, and in particular, the absence of normal invariant state implies the absence of invariant state for this action. We will show that this property actually characterizes property (T).

We will also consider the implication (4)  ⇒  (1) for general discrete group Γ with property (T,FD) in the sense of [\cite=LZ89] (Proposition [\ref=prop:no-inv-state]). Consequently, a minimally almost period discrete group satisfying (4) is finitely generated.

We end this introduction by introducing more notation. Throughout this article, [formula] and L(K) denote the conjugate Hilbert space of K and the space of bounded linear maps on K respectively. For any ξ,η∈K, we define ωξ,η∈L(K)* by ωξ,η(x): = 〈xξ,η〉 (x∈L(K)) and set ωξ: = ωξ,ξ. We consider pπ∈L(K) to be the orthogonal projection onto Kπ. Furthermore, we denote by C*(π) the C*-subalgebra generated by {πt}t∈Γ and by vN(π) the bicommutant of C*(π). We define a functional [formula] formally by [formula] (warning: επ is not necessarily well-defined.)

Invariant States and Spectral Gap Actions (Theorem [\ref=thm:main])

Let us start with the following lemma, which may be a known result. Note that part (d) of this lemma is motivated by [\cite=Pasch] (and one can also obtain this part using the argument in [\cite=Pasch]).

(a) επ is well-defined if and only if 1Γ is weakly contained in π. This is equivalent to the existence of ψ∈L(K)*+ satisfying

[formula]

(in this case, επ  =  ψ|C*(π)).

(b) π does not have a spectral gap if and only if there is ψ∈L(K)*+ satisfying [\eqref=eqt:m-pi] and ψ(pπ)  =  0.

(c) If ψ∈L(K)*+ satisfies [\eqref=eqt:m-pi], then ψ(πtx)  =  ψ(x) (t∈Γ,x∈L(K)) and ψ is Ad  π-invariant.

(d) pπ∉C*(π) if and only if pπ  ≠  0 and π does not have a spectral gap.

Let N be a von Neumann algebra. We denote by N* the pre-dual space of N, which is naturally identified with the subspace of all weak-*-continuous linear functionals in the dual space N*. Let

[formula]

and [formula] (where [formula] means the weak-*-closure of a subset E  ⊆  N*). Clearly, [formula].

The following theorem is a refined version of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. This result can also be regarded as generalizations of the main results in [\cite=Pasch] and in [\cite=LH] (see also [\cite=Lub]).

Let α be an action of a group Γ on a von Neumann algebra N with standard form [formula]. Consider the following statements.

If [formula] satisfies ψ(Uαt)  =  1 (t∈Γ), then ψ(pUα)  ≠  0.

α has a spectral gap.

pUα∈C*(Uα)

[formula].

One has (G1)  ⇔  (G2)  ⇒  (G3) and (G2)  ⇒  (G4).

It is easy to see that [formula] spans N*α (see e.g. [\cite=Pat]). Moreover, if we denote [formula], it is not hard to check that [formula] spans [formula]. Thus, Statement (G4) is equivalent to the fact that [formula].

(a) The map sending [formula] to ωξ∈N* restricts to a bijection from [formula] onto the positive part of Nα*.

(b) If [formula] is finite dimensional, then Nα* is finite dimensional.

(c) If [formula], then dim Nα*  =  1.

The following proposition concerns some converses of the implications in Theorem [\ref=thm:sp-gap-act-inv-mean]. Note that the idea of the argument for pUα∈vN(Uα) in part (b) comes from [\cite=Pasch].

Let α be an action of a group Γ on a von Neumann algebra N.

(a) If pUα  ≠  0, then Statement (G3) implies Statement (G1).

(b) If pUα∈N, then Statement (G4) implies Statement (G1) and pUα belongs to the center [formula] of vN(Uα).

Our next example shows that Statement (G4) does not imply Statement (G2) in general. We first set some notation and recall some facts. Let IN be the inner automorphism group of N and β be the canonical action of IN on N. Then β-invariant states on N are precisely tracial states. Suppose, in addition, that N admits a normal faithful tracial state τ. If (Hτ,Ψτ) is the GNS construction with respect to τ and Λτ:N  →  Hτ is the canonical map, then [formula] and the canonical action of N on [formula] can be identified with Ψτ. For any g∈Aut(N), one has Uβg(Λτ(x))  =  Λτ(g(x)) (x∈N).

Invariant States and Inner Amenability (Theorem [\ref=thm:inner])

In this section, we will give an application of Theorem [\ref=thm:sp-gap-act-inv-mean] to inner amenability. We recall (from the main theorem in [\cite=Eff]) that an ICC group Γ is inner amenable if and only if there is a net {ξi}i∈I of unit vectors in [formula] such that [formula] for any t∈Γ (where γ is as in Example [\ref=eg:4-not-2](a)). Notice that this inner amenability is slightly different from the one in [\cite=LP] and [\cite=Pat], and it is called "non-trivially inner amenable" in [\cite=Pat].

Let us consider another extension of inner amenability to general (not necessarily ICC) discrete groups.

Γ is said to be strongly inner amenable if the conjugate representation γ does not have a spectral gap.

It is obvious that strong inner amenability implies inner amenability, and the converse holds when Γ is an ICC group. On the other hand, all abelian groups and all property (T) groups are not strongly inner amenable.

Let α be the action of Γ on [formula] given by αt(x): = γtxγt- 1, Γfin be the normal subgroup consisting of elements in Γ with finite conjugacy classes and A(Γ) be the predual of L(Γ).

(a) Consider the following statements.

Γ  /  Γfin is inner amenable.

[formula] is not the [formula]-closure of [formula].

Γ is strongly inner amenable.

There is [formula] satisfying ψ(γt)  =  1 (t∈Γ) and ψ(pγ)  =  0.

pγ∉C*(γ).

L(Γ)*α is not the σ(L(Γ)*,L(Γ))-closure of A(Γ)α.

[formula] does not coincide with the set of tracial states on L(Γ).

Then (S1)  ⇒  (S2)  ⇒  (S3)  ⇔  (S4)  ⇔  (S5) and (S6)  ⇔  (S7)  ⇒  (S3).

(b) If Γfin coincides with the center of Γ, then (S5)  ⇒  (S1) and pγ∈Z(vN(γ)).

(c) If Γfin is finite, we have (S5)  ⇒  (S1).

The following theorem concerns the case when there is a unique inner invariant state on L(Γ). Part (b) of which gives Theorem [\ref=thm:inner].

Let α be as in Proposition [\ref=prop:st-inner].

(a) If Γ is amenable, then there are more than one α-invariant states on L(Γ).

(b) Suppose that Γ is an ICC group. If Γ is not inner amenable, there is a unique α-invariant state on L(Γ). The converse holds when Γ is finitely generated.

(a) It was shown in [\cite=Pasch] that inner amenability of an ICC group Γ is equivalent to pγ∉C*(γ). However, Proposition [\ref=prop:st-inner](b) tells us that pγ∈vN(γ) for any ICC group Γ, whether or not it is inner amenable.

(b) A functional φ∈L(Γ)* is α-invariant if and only if φ(ax)  =  φ(xa) (x∈L(Γ);a∈C*(λ)  =  C*r(Γ)). Hence, the difference between α-invariant states and tracial states on L(Γ) is similar to the different between inner amenability of Γ and property Gamma of L(Γ) (see e.g. [\cite=Vaes]). It is shown in Proposition [\ref=prop:st-inner](a) that if Γ is not strongly inner amenable, all α-invariant states on L(Γ) are tracial states. On the other hand, if Γ is an amenable ICC group, then L(Γ) has only one tracial state, but there exist more than one α-invariant states on L(Γ) (by Theorem [\ref=thm:ICC](a)).

Invariant States and Property (T) (Theorem [\ref=thm:property-T])

Although Statement (G4) does not imply Statement (G2) for individual action, if Statement (G4) holds for every action, then so does Statement (G2). This can be seen in the following result, which is a more elaborated version of Theorem [\ref=thm:property-T].

Let Γ be a countable discrete group. The following statements are equivalent.

Γ has property (T).

If α is an action of Γ on a von Neumann algebra N and [formula] satisfying ψ(Uαt)  =  1 (t∈Γ), one has ψ(pUα)  ≠  0.

[formula] for every action α of Γ on a von Neumann algebra N.

For each action α of Γ on a von Neumann algebra N with dim Nα* = 1, there is only one α-invariant state on N.

For any Hilbert space K and any action α of Γ with L(K)α*  =  (0), there is no α-invariant state on L(K).

One may regard Theorem [\ref=thm:equiv-prop-T] as a sort of non-commutative analogue of [\cite=Sch]. There is also a non-commutative analogue of [\cite=Sch], which is basically a reformulation of [\cite=B]. More precisely, the following are equivalence for a discrete group Γ:

Γ is amenable.

[formula] for every action α of Γ on a von Neumann algebra N.

For any action α of Γ on L(K) (where K is a Hilbert space) with L(K)α*  =  (0), there exists an α-invariant state on L(K).

In fact, if Γ is amenable, then [\cite=B] implies that [formula] weakly contains 1Γ. Thus, if we identify N with the subalgebra [formula] of [formula], an almost [formula]-invariant unit vector will produce an α-invariant state on N. To show (A3) ⇒   (A1), one may consider the action α: = Ad  λ on [formula]. It is easy to see that [formula] (e.g. by Lemma [\ref=lem:H-N_*](a)) and an α-invariant state will restricts to a left invariant state on [formula], which implies that Γ is amenable.

Recall from [\cite=LZ89] that Γ has property (T,FD) if 1Γ is not in the closure of the subset of [formula] consisting of non-trivial finite dimensional irreducible representations.

Let Γ be an infinite discrete group with property (T,FD). Then (T1) is equivalent to the following statement.

For any action α of Γ on a von Neumann algebra N with Nα*  =  (0), there is no α-invariant state on N.

A similar statement as the above for the strong property (T) of locally compact groups can be found in [\cite=LN].

Let Γ be a minimally almost periodic group in the sense of [\cite=vNW40] (i.e. there is no non-trivial finite dimensional irreducible representation of Γ). If Γ satisfies (T5'), then it has property (T) and hence is finitely generated.
