Decompositions of [formula] into convex sets generate codimension 1 manifold factors

Introduction

A space X is said to be a codimension one manifold factor provided that [formula] is a manifold. It is a long standing unsolved problem as to whether all resolvable generalized manifolds are codimension one manifold factors [\cite=Daverman_S]. This is the so-called Product With a Line Problem and it is the essence of the famous Generalized R. L. Moore Problem [\cite=Bertinoro] [\cite=Moore1] [\cite=Moore2].

The Product With a Line Problem speaks directly to one of the most fundamental questions in geometric topology, which is how to recognize manifolds [\cite=Cannon] [\cite=Edwards_2] [\cite=Repovs1] [\cite=Repovs2] [\cite=Repovs3]. Because manifolds have a rich structure which is useful to exploit in many areas of mathematics and its applications, it is important to recognize when one is dealing with a space that is a manifold. One notable example is the relevance of the Product With a Line Problem to the famous Busemann Conjecture in metric geometry [\cite=Busemann1] [\cite=Busemann2] [\cite=Busemann3] [\cite=HaRe].

One might wonder even if a decomposition of [formula] into convex sets could give rise to a decomposition space topologically distinct from [formula]. This problem was investigated for several years beginning with Bing in the 1950's [\cite=Armentrout] [\cite=Bing] [\cite=CannonLO] [\cite=Eaton] [\cite=McAuley]. In 1970, Armentrout [\cite=Armentrout] produced the first example of a decomposition of [formula] into convex sets that yields a non-manifold. Then in 1975, Eaton [\cite=Eaton] demonstrated that a certain decomposition of [formula] into points and straight line segments, originally proposed by Bing [\cite=Bing], is indeed topologically distinct from [formula]. Hence, this type of complexity is significant. It should also be noted that there are no known examples of a non-manifold resulting from a decomposition of [formula] into convex sets.

In this paper we shall investigate how the type of complexity represented by decompositions of [formula] into convex sets can affect the classification of a decomposition space as a codimension one manifold factor. We shall demonstrate that decompositions of [formula], n  ≥  4, into convex sets are always codimension one manifold factors. In particular, we shall show that such spaces have a particularly strong general position property, the disjoint arc-disk property.

Preliminaries

We briefly review some basic definitions and notations. Recall that a map f:X  →  Y is said to be proper if whenever C is a compact subset of Y, then f- 1(C) is compact.

There are various equivalent definitions of upper semicontinuous decompositions [\cite=Daverman_book], but the following will be the most useful for our purposes:

A decomposition G of M into compact sets is said to be upper semicontinuous (usc) if and only if the associated decomposition map π:M  →  M / G is a proper map.

A compact subset C of a space X is said to be cell-like if for each neighborhood U of C in X, C can be contracted to a point inside U [\cite=MiRe]. A usc decomposition G of M is said to be cell-like if each element g∈G is cell-like. A map f:Y  →  X is said to be cell-like if for each x∈X, f- 1(x) is cell-like. A resolvable generalized n-manifold is an n-dimensional space X that is the image of a cell-like map f:M  →  X where M is an n-manifold.

Convex sets are contractible, and hence they are cell-like. Thus, a usc decomposition G of [formula] into convex sets is a cell-like decomposition and the associated decomposition map [formula] is a cell-like map. The fact that [formula] is finite-dimensional follows from a result of Zemke (see [\cite=Zemke]). Therefore, in this setting, [formula] is a resolvable generalized n-manifold.

For resolvable generalized manifolds, we have the following very useful approximate lifting theorem, which follows from [\cite=Daverman_book]:

Suppose that G is a cell-like decomposition of a manifold M, with decomposition map π:M  →  M / G, and that the quotient space M / G is finite-dimensional. Then for any map f:Z  →  M / G of a finite-dimensional compact polyhedron Z, and any ε > 0, there exists a map F:Z  →  M such that πF is an ε-approximation of f.

General position properties are very useful in detecting codimension one manifold factors [\cite=Daverman-Halverson_2] [\cite=Halverson_1] [\cite=Halverson_2] [\cite=Halverson_3] [\cite=HaRe2]. For our results, we shall only need to employ the following:

A space X is said to have the disjoint arc-disk property (DADP) provided that any two maps α:I  →  X and f:D2  →  X can be approximated by maps with disjoint images, where I denotes the unit interval and D2 denotes a disk.

The following theorem was demonstrated in [\cite=Daverman_1]:

A resolvable generalized manifold having DADP is a codimension one manifold factor.

Useful in discussions of the DADP is the local 0-co-connectedness property. A set Z  ⊂  X is said to have the local 0-co-connectedness property (0-LCC) in X if for every [formula], each neighborhood U of z contains another neighborhood V of z so that any two points in V - Z are path connected in U - Z. Note that if Z is nowhere dense in X, then [formula].

The following theorem can be found in [\cite=Daverman_book]:

Each k-dimensional closed subset of a generalized n-manifold, where k  ≤  n - 2, is 0-LCC.

Since a k-dimensional closed subset of a generalized n-manifold X, where k  ≤  n - 1, is nowhere dense in X, we have the following corollary:

If Z is a k-dimensional closed subset of a generalized n-manifold X, where k  ≤  n - 2, then any path α:I  →  X can be approximated by a path α':I  →  X - Z.

Main Results

The main result of this paper is the following theorem:

Let G be an upper semicontinuous decomposition of [formula] into convex sets, where n  ≥  4. Then [formula] is a codimension one manifold factor.

This theorem will follow immediately as a corollary of Theorem [\ref=DADP_thm] and the following theorem:

Let G be an upper semicontinuous decomposition of [formula] into convex sets, where n  ≥  4. Then [formula] has the DADP.

Let [formula] and ε  >  0. It follows from Corollary [\ref=path] that it suffices to show that there is an ε-approximation [formula] of f such that f'(D2) is 2-dimensional.

Let [formula] be a piecewise linear map, that is an ε-approximate lift of f. We shall show that f'  =  πF is then the desired map.

Let T denote a triangulation of F(D2). We claim that if σ is a 2-simplex of T, then f'(σ) is 2-dimensional. To see this, let Gσ be the decomposition induced over π(σ), i.e. Gσ is the decomposition of [formula] having as the only nontrivial elements, the nontrivial elements of G that meet σ. Let [formula] be the associated decomposition map. Note that ω is necessarily a proper map, being a decomposition induced over a closed set in the decomposition space of a usc decomposition.

Let P be the 2-dimensional plane in [formula] that contains σ. Let ϖ denote the restriction of ω to P. Then ϖ is also a proper map. Thus ϖ determines a usc decomposition of the plane into convex sets, elements that do not separate the plane. It now follows from a classical result of Moore [\cite=Moore1] [\cite=Moore2], that ϖ is a near-homeomorphism onto its image. Thus ϖ(σ) is at most 2-dimensional.

But ϖ(σ) is homeomorphic to ω(σ), which in turn is homeomorphic to π(σ). Thus π(σ) is at most 2-dimensional subset of [formula]. Hence

[formula]

is a 2-dimensional subset of the generalized n-manifold [formula] [\cite=HW].

Conclusions

As we have seen, the complexity represented by decompositions into convex sets does not inhibit a decomposition space from being a codimension one manifold factor. The fact that such spaces satisfy the DADP is a pleasant result.

It is well known that not all codimension one manifold factors satisfy the DADP, and hence the DADP is not a general position property that provides a characterization of codimension one manifold factors. In fact, the DADP condition is a relatively weak tool for detecting codimension one manifold factors, compared to other general position properties such as:

the disjoint homotopies property [\cite=Halverson_1];

the plentiful 2-manifolds property [\cite=Halverson_1];

the 0-stitched disks property [\cite=Halverson_3];

the method of δ-fractured maps [\cite=Halverson_2]; and

the disjoint topographies (or disjoint concordance) property [\cite=Daverman-Halverson_2] [\cite=HaRe2].

It is these stronger properties that must be utilized to demonstrate that spaces such as the Totally Wild Flow [\cite=Cannon-Daverman2] and the Ghastly Spaces [\cite=Daverman-Walsh] are codimension one manifold factors.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that we must look to other types of complexities to realize a counterexample to the Generalized R. L. Moore Problem, if such an example does indeed exist.
