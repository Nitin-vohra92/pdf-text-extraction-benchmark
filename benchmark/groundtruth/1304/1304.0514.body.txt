Abstract. Let a,b,c be relatively prime positive integers such that a2 + b2 = c2. In 1956, Jemanowicz conjectured that for any positive integer n, the only solution of (an)x + (bn)y = (cn)z in positive integers is (x,y,z) = (2,2,2). Let k  ≥  1 be an integer and Fk = 22k + 1 be a Fermat number. In this paper, we show that Jemanowicz' conjecture is true for Pythagorean triples (a,b,c) = (Fk - 2,22k - 1 + 1,Fk).

Introduction

Let a,b,c be relatively prime positive integers such that a2 + b2 = c2 with 2|b. Clearly, for any positive integer n, the Diophantine equation

[formula]

has the solution (x,y,z) = (2,2,2). In 1956, Sierpiski [\cite=Sierpinski] showed there is no other solution when n = 1 and (a,b,c) = (3,4,5), and Jemanowicz [\cite=Jesmanowicz] proved that when n = 1 and (a,b,c) = (5,12,13),(7,24,25),(9,40,41),(11,60,61), Eq.([\ref=eqn1]) has only the solution (x,y,z) = (2,2,2). Moreover, he conjectured that for any positive integer n, the Eq.([\ref=eqn1]) has no positive integer solution other than (x,y,z) = (2,2,2). Let k  ≥  1 be an integer and Fk = 22k + 1 be a Fermat number. Recently, the first author of this paper and Yang [\cite=Tang] proved that if 1  ≤  k  ≤  4, then the Diophantine equation

[formula]

has no positive integer solution other than (x,y,z) = (2,2,2). For related problems, see ([\cite=Deng], [\cite=Miyazaki], [\cite=Miyazaki2]).

In this paper, we obtain the following result.

For any positive integer n and Fermat number Fk, Eq.([\ref=eqn2]) has only the solution (x,y,z) = (2,2,2).

Throughout this paper, let m be a positive integer and a be any integer relatively prime to m. If h is the least positive integer such that [formula], then h is called the order of a modulo m, denoted by [formula].

Lemmas

([\cite=Lu]) For any positive integer m, the Diophantine equation (4m2 - 1)x + (4m)y = (4m2 + 1)z has only the solution (x,y,z) = (2,2,2).

(See [\cite=Deng]) If z  ≥   max {x,y}, then the Diophantine equation ax + by = cz, where a,b and c are any positive integers (not necessarily relative prime) such that a2 + b2 = c2, has no solution other than (x,y,z) = (2,2,2).

(See [\cite=Le]) If the Diophantine equation (na)x + (nb)y = (nc)z(with a2 + b2 = c2) has a solution (x,y,z)  ≠  (2,2,2), then x,y,z are distinct.

(See [\cite=Deng2013]) Let a,b,c be any primitive Pythagorean triple such that the Diophantine equation ax + by = cz has the only positive integer solution (x,y,z) = (2,2,2). Then ([\ref=eqn1]) has no positive integer solution satisfying x > y > z or y > x > z.

Let k be a positive integer and Fk = 22k + 1 be a Fermat number. If (x,y,z) is a solution of the Eq.([\ref=eqn2]) with (x,y,z)  ≠  (2,2,2), then x < z < y.

By Lemmas [\ref=lem2]-[\ref=lem4], it is sufficient to prove that the Eq.([\ref=eqn2]) has no solution (x,y,z) satisfying y < z < x. By Lemma [\ref=lem1], we may suppose that [formula] and the Eq.([\ref=eqn2]) has a solution (x,y,z) with y < z < x. Then we have

[formula]

By [\eqref=eqn9] we may write n = 2r with [formula]. Noting that

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Since k  ≥  1, by ([\ref=eqn10]) we have [formula], [formula] Write z = 2z1, we have

[formula]

Let [formula] be the standard prime factorization of Fk - 1 with [formula]. By the known Fermat primes, we know that there is the possibility of t = 1. Moreover,

[formula]

Noting that gcd (Fz1k - 1,Fz1k + 1) = 2, we know that pt divide only one of Fz1k - 1 and Fz1k + 1.

Case 1. pt|Fz1k - 1. Then [formula]. Noting that [formula], we have [formula]. By ([\ref=eqn12]) we have

[formula]

Since gcd (Fz1k - 1,Fz1k + 1) = 2, by ([\ref=eqn11]) we have

[formula]

Hence Fxk - 1|Fz1k - 1.

Case 2. pt|Fz1k + 1. Then [formula]. Noting that [formula], we have 2k - 1|z1, but [formula]. By ([\ref=eqn12]) we have

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Since gcd (Fz1k - 1,Fz1k + 1) = 2, by ([\ref=eqn11]) we have

[formula]

Hence Fxk - 1|Fz1k + 1.

However,

[formula]

which is impossible.

This completes the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem5].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1]

By Lemma [\ref=lem1] and Lemma [\ref=lem5], we may suppose that [formula] and the Eq.([\ref=eqn2]) has a solution (x,y,z) with x < z < y. Then

[formula]

It is clear from [\eqref=eqn13a] that

[formula]

Let [formula] be the standard prime factorization of [formula] and write [formula] where [formula], [formula]. Let [formula]. If [formula], then let P(k,n) = 1. If [formula], then let

[formula]

By ([\ref=eqn13a]), we have

[formula]

Since y  ≥  2, it follows that

[formula]

If 3|P(k,n), then [formula]. This implies that x is even. If [formula], then [formula]. Let P(k,n) = 1 + 2vW, [formula]. Then v  ≥  2. Suppose that x is odd, then

[formula]

Thus v  ≥  2k and P(k,n)  ≥  Fk, a contradiction with

[formula]

Therefore, x is even. Write x = 2uN with [formula]. Then u  ≥  1.

Case 1. [formula]. Let P(k,n) = 2dM - 1 with [formula]. Then d  ≥  2 and

[formula]

By ([\ref=eqn4.3]) we have u + d  ≥  2k.

Choose a [formula], let piν = 2rt + 1 with r  ≥  1, [formula]. Then

[formula]

Thus d + r  ≤  2k. Hence u  ≥  r. By ([\ref=eqn14a]) we have

[formula]

Noting that piν - 1|2ut, we have

[formula]

Since [formula] is even and [formula], we have [formula].

Case 2. [formula]. Let P(k,n) = 2d'M' + 1 with [formula]. Then d'  ≥  2 and

[formula]

By ([\ref=eqn4.3]) we have u + d'  ≥  2k.

Choose a [formula], let piμ = 2r't' + 1 with r'  ≥  1, [formula]. Then

[formula]

Thus d' + r' < 2k. Hence u > r'. By ([\ref=eqn14a]) we have

[formula]

Noting that piμ - 1|2ut', we have

[formula]

Since [formula] is even and [formula], we have [formula].

Write z = 2z1,x = 2x1. By ([\ref=eqn14a]), we have

[formula]

Noting that

[formula]

we have

[formula]

or

[formula]

However,

[formula]

a contradiction.

This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1].
