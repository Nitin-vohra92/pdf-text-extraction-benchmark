Mathematical modeling of thermal stabilization of vertical wells on high performance computing systems

Mathematical model

We consider a mathematical model that describes the distribution of temperature with phase transitions at a given temperature T* in a domain [formula]. Here Ω+(t) is a domain with liquid phase, where the temperature is above the phase transition temperature

[formula]

and Ω-(t) stands for a domain with solid phase,

[formula]

The phase transition occurs at a phase change boundary S = S(t).

For simulation of heat transfer with phase transitions, the classical Stefan model is used [\cite=vab], [\cite=vas]. This model describes the thermal processes accompanied by a phase change media, absorption and release of latent heat. We use

[formula]

where L is thelatent heat of the phase transition, k stands for the absolute permeability of the porous medium, μ is the water viscosity and p is the pressure in the soil.

For the coefficients of the equation, we have the following relations

[formula]

and

[formula]

where ρ+,c+ и ρ-,c- are the density and specific heat capacity of the melt and frozen zone, respectively.

Since we consider the process of heat propagation in porous media, then for the coefficients we have:

[formula]

[formula]

where m is the porosity. Indexes sc,w,i denote the skeleton of the porous medium, water and ice. For the coefficients of thermal conductivity in the melt and frozen zone, we have similar relationships

[formula]

[formula]

In practice, phase transformations do not occur instantaneously and can occur in a small temperature range

[formula]

Finite element realization

The equation ([\ref=2]) is approximated using a finite element method. We multiply the temperature equation by a test function v, and integrate it using the Green formula

[formula]

Here H1(Ω) is a Sobolev space, which consists of the functions v such that v2 and [formula] has a finite integral in the Ω and H10(Ω)  =  {v∈H1(Ω):v|ΓD  =  0}.

To approximate in time, we apply the standard fully implicit scheme and use the simplest linearization (from the previous time level)

[formula]

In such a way, we arrive at the following classical variational formulation of the problem: to find [formula] such that

[formula]

The process of solving equation ([\ref=T.2.3]) can be represented as follows. While tcur  <  tmax:

Calculate tcur: tcur  =  tcur  +  τ;

Save a previous time lavel values Tprev  =  T;

Recalculate the ambient temperature Tair:

[formula]

If the temperature of the soil is less than Tair, then the freezing columns turn on, else turn off;

The temperature at the new time level are solved by a linear solver;

Write the results to a file.

Numerical implementation is performed using the Fenics package [\cite=fenics]. For results visualization, the values at each time level were recorded in vtk file format that was visualized using ParaView program.

Numerical results

As a model problem, we consider the process of thermal stabilization of the mouth of the oil or gas wells [\cite=snip], [\cite=fund1]. The geometric domain was built using the Netgen mesher. The computational domain is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:netg] and has a length of 40 meter in each direction, the well (radius 0.1 meter) is located in the middle of a field, where oil flows with a given positive temperature. A cement layer with the thickness of 0.2 meter is used for well heat insulation. 8 freezing columns with a radius of 0.05 meter are deepened to 14 meters around the well. The top sand layer has the thickness of 2 meters. Near the well, there is laid penopleks (10 by 10 m, thickness of 200 mm).

Parameters of the problem are given in Table [\ref=tab:T-2]. The computational grid contains 10,903,946 cells.

The numerical results are presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:T5-3d]. Figure [\ref=fig:T5-2d] illustrates the efficiency of the seasonal cooling devices, which accumulate the winter chill in the ground and provide additional bearing capacity in the summer. By numerical simulation of the temperature stabilization of soils using freezing system, we can conclude that the presence of freezing columns can reduce soil thawing around wells The calculations were performed using the NEFU computational cluster Ariane Kuzmin. The computation time using 64 processors (see Fig. [\ref=fig:parallel]) was about 14 minutes, with 32 processors - about 21 minutes, and with 16 processors - about 40 minutes, which shows good efficiency of parallelization.
