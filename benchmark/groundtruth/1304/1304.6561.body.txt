The Gauss-Bonnet-Chern mass for graphic manifolds

Introduction

A complete manifold (Mn,g) is said to be asymptotically flat of order τ if there is a compact set K such that [formula] is diffeomorphic to [formula] for some R > 0 such that in this coordinate chart, the metric gij(x) satisifes

[formula]

The ADM mass was introduced by Arnowitt, Deser and Misner [\cite=ADM] for asymptotically flat manifold.

[formula]

where ωn - 1 is the area of the standard (n - 1) dimensional unit sphere, Sr is the Euclidean coordinate sphere, dS is the volume element on Sr induced by the Euclidean metric and ν = r- 1x is the outward normal of Sr in [formula]. Bartnik [\cite=Ba] proved that the ADM mass is well-defined and is a geometric invariant for asymptotically flat manifold provided the order [formula].

The positive mass theorem and Penrose inequality for ADM mass are two important results in differential geometry and general relativity. The positive mass theorem states that the ADM mass is nonnegative on any asymptotically flat manifold with order [formula] and with nonnegative scalar curvature, which was proved by Schoen-Yau [\cite=SY79] [\cite=SY80] for 3  ≤  n  ≤  7, Schoen-Yau [\cite=SY88] for conformally flat manifold, Witten [\cite=Wit] for spin manifold, Lam [\cite=Lam] for codimension one graphic manifold and Mirandola-Vitório [\cite=MV] for arbitrary codimension graphic manifold with flat normal bundle. The Penrose inequality can be viewed as a generalization of the positive mass theorem in the presence of an area minimizing horizon. When the asymptotically flat manifold has nonnegative scalar curvature and has order [formula], the Penrose inequality gives the lower bound for the ADM mass of M in terms of the area of the horizon Σ, precisely

[formula]

The equality holds if and only if M is isometric to the Schwarzschild metric. The Penrose inequality was proved by Huisken-Ilmanen [\cite=HI] for n = 3 and Σ is connected by using inverse mean curvature flow, Bray [\cite=Br] for n = 3 and Σ has multiple components by using conformal flow, Bray-Lee [\cite=BL] for 3  ≤  n  ≤  7, with the extra requirement that M is spin for the rigidity statement. Lam [\cite=Lam] also proved the Penrose inequality for codimension one graphic manifold. See also [\cite=HW1] [\cite=HW2] [\cite=deLG1] [\cite=deLG2] for related work. Recently, Mirandola-Vitório generalized Lam's result to arbitrary codimension graph with flat normal bundle. The readers can refer to [\cite=Br1] [\cite=Mars] for surveys on the the positive mass theorem and Penrose inequality.

Recall that the tensor P1 given by

[formula]

is closely related to the scalar curvature R. In fact, we have R = Pijkl1Rijkl. By using the tensor P1, one can also define a mass (see [\cite=GWW]), which is just the ADM mass with a slightly different but equivalent form

[formula]

Recently, Ge-Wang-Wu [\cite=GWW] introduced a new mass, which they called Gauss-Bonnect-Chern mass m2, by using the tensor P2 (in the following, we will write P2 as P for simplicity).

[formula]

Recall that the second Gauss-Bonnet curvature L2 satisfies L2 = Pijkl2Rijkl.

Let n  ≥  5. Suppose (Mn,g) is an asymptotically flat manifold of decay order [formula], and the second Gauss-Bonnet curvature given by L2 = PijklRijkl is integrable. Then the second Gauss-Bonnet-Chern mass m2 is defined as

[formula]

where [formula].

In the same paper [\cite=GWW], Ge-Wang-Wu proved that m2 is well-defined and is a geometric invariant provided (M,g) is asymptotically flat of order [formula]. Then they asked the following natural question: In [\cite=GWW], Ge-Wang-Wu give an affirmative answer to these questions for codimension one graphic manifolds. In the second paper, Ge-Wang-Wu [\cite=GWW2] answer the questions for conformally flat manifolds.

Inspired by Mirandola-Vitório's new paper [\cite=MV], we now consider the positive mass theorem and Penrose inequality of m2 for arbitrary codimension graphic manifold. To state our theorems, we first give the following definition.

Let [formula] be a smooth map and let fαi,fαij,fαijk denote the first,second and third derivatives of f, where 1  ≤  i,j,k  ≤  n and 1  ≤  α  ≤  m. f is called asymptotically flat of order τ if

[formula]

at infinity for some τ  >  (n - 4) / 3.

Since the induced metric on the graph [formula] (see section 2 for detail) is gij  =  δij + fαifαj. We can easily check that M is asymptotically flat of order τ.

Let [formula] be the graph of an asymptotically flat map [formula] endowed with the natural metric. Then the second Gauss-Bonnet-Chern mass m2 of M is equal to

[formula]

where [formula] is defined by [\eqref=eq-L2] and it vanishes provided that M has flat normal bundle. In particular, if M has flat normal bundle and nonnegative L2 curvature, then m2 is nonnegative.

The second part of this paper considers the Penrose inequality for m2 in the graphic case. We consider asymptotically flat manifold containing an area outer minimizing horizon. A horizon is simply a minimal surface, which is area outer minimizing if every other surface enclosing it has greater area. We have

Let [formula] be a bounded open subset with Lipschitz boundary ∂Ω. Let [formula] be an asymptotically flat map. Assume that f is constant along each connected component of Σ  =  ∂Ω. Let M be the graph of f with its natural metric. Then where [formula] and H3 is the 3-th mean curvature of the hypersurface Σ in [formula].

If Σ is in the level set of f, then Σ can be identified with its graph {(x,f(x))|x∈Σ}. Then the mean curvature Ĥ of f(Σ) in (M,g) and the mean curvature H of Σ in [formula] are related by (see section 4)

[formula]

Therefore if |Df(x)|  →    ∞   as x  →  Σ  =  ∂Ω, the graph of Σ is a horizon in (M,g).

Let [formula] be an open subset. Let [formula] be a continuous map that is constant along each connected component of the boundary Σ  =  ∂Ω and asymptotically flat in [formula]. Assume that the graph M of f extends C2 to its boundary ∂M. Assume further that along each connected component Σi of ∂M, the manifold [formula] is tangent to the cylinder Σ  ×  li, where li is a straight line of [formula]. Then where H3 is the 3-th mean curvature of the embedding Σ in [formula].

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm4] is just by checking |Df(x)|  →    ∞   as x  →  Σ.

A hypersurface [formula] is called 3-convex if its mean curvature H, 2-th mean curvature H2 and 3-th mean curvature H3 are positive on Σ. As in [\cite=Lam] [\cite=GWW] [\cite=HW2] [\cite=MV], by applying the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality due to Guan-Li [\cite=GL] to Theorem [\ref=thm4], we conclude that

Under the hypothesis of Theorem [\ref=thm4], and we assume that M has nonnegative L2 and flat normal bundle. If each connected component of the boundary Σ  =  ∂Ω is 3-convex and star-shaped, then

[formula]

Moreover, the equality implies L2 vanishes identically on M and Σ is a sphere.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we give some notations and basic formulas. In section 3, we first prove proposition [\ref=prop-mass] which is the key ingredient to prove our main theorems. The crucial step of proving proposition [\ref=prop-mass] is checking that [formula] can be represented as normal curvature terms. In the sections 4 and 5, we will use the similar idea of Ge-Wang-Wu [\cite=GWW] to complete the proof of positive mass theorem and Penrose inequality for m2. In the last section, we give a generalization of Ge-Wang-Wu's [\cite=GWW1] result on Positive mass theorem and Penrose inequality in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to arbitrary codimension graph.

Preliminaries

Recall that on a complete Riemannian manifold (M,g), the Gauss-Bonnet curvature L2 is defined as

[formula]

where the (0,4) tensor P is given by [\eqref=def-P]. Note that P has the same symmetric property as the Riemannian curvature tensor, i.e.,

[formula]

P also satisfies the divergence-free property (cf. [\cite=GWW] [\cite=Da]), i.e.,

[formula]

We now suppose [formula] is the graph of a smooth asymptotically flat map [formula]. The vectors ∂i = (ei,fαieα) are tangential and the vectors ηα = ( - Dfα,eα) are normal to M. In this paper, we will use the convention on the indices:

[formula]

The induced metric on M is

[formula]

We will denote the matrix U by (cf.[\cite=MV])

[formula]

with the inverse matrix Uαβ. Then

[formula]

Denote [formula] the components of f. The gradient of [formula] is

[formula]

The shape operator Aα with respect to ηα

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

The shape operator is symmetric:

[formula]

for any tangent X,Y. The second fundamental form

[formula]

The curvature tensor Rijkl, the Gauss-Bonnet curvature L2 and the Christoffel symbols Γkij have the following expressions:

[formula]

By Gauss equation, we have

[formula]

The Gauss-Bonnet curvature L2

[formula]

By the definition of Γkij,

[formula]

The commutation of shape operators gives the normal curvature operator [formula],

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

for any tangent X,Y and any 1  ≤  α,β  ≤  m. The Ricci operator Rc:TM  →  TM is given by

[formula]

which is symmetric in X and Y. We have the following lemma about the commutation of the Ricci operator Rc and shape operator Aα.

The Ricci operator Rc and shape operator Aα commutes as following:

[formula]

By [\eqref=eq-normal] and the definition of Ricci operator, we have

[formula]

which gives the commutation formula [\eqref=eq-commute].

In the rest of the paper, we will denote the right-hand side of [\eqref=eq-commute] by [formula].

Positive mass theorem for m2

We first prove the following proposition, which is a key ingredient for proving our theorems.

[formula]

where [formula] can be expressed as some normal curvature terms (see [\eqref=eq-L2] for the explicit expression). In particular, when the graph M of f has flat normal bundle, we have

[formula]

The equation [\eqref=key-equ] was shown by Ge-Wang-Wu in [\cite=GWW] for the hypersurface graph case, i.e., [formula] and [formula] is a hypersurface in [formula]. Equation [\eqref=key-equ] was the key ingredient to show the positive mass theorem for m2 in the hypersurface graph case.

[formula]

By the symmetric property [\eqref=P-symmetri] of Pijkl, the second term is equal to:

[formula]

By the divergence-free property [\eqref=P-divfree] of Pijkl and [\eqref=P-symmetri], the first term:

[formula]

where

[formula]

We will first calculate I:

[formula]

Thus we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

For simplicity, we denote

[formula]

Note that in general, Tijkl has no symmetric property. In the following five lemmas, we will calculate [formula] explicitly. Recall that

[formula]

In the following calculation, we will use [\eqref=eq-shape],[\eqref=eq-normal],[\eqref=eq-Ricci] and [\eqref=eq-commute] many times.

We have

[formula]

From lemma [\ref=lem-formulas], we get

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Further more, the commutation of shape operator gives the normal curvature terms.

[formula]

We conclude that the quantity [\eqref=riem-eq1] is equal to

[formula]

Finally

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Recall

[formula]

We have

[formula]

[formula]

We have

[formula]

[formula]

We have

[formula]

We calculate as following:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then the lemma follows easily.

Finally, from lemma [\ref=lem-Riem] to lemma [\ref=lem-R], we get that

[formula]

We complete the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop-mass].

From the above proof, we can also derive that

[formula]

where [formula].

From proposition [\ref=prop-mass] and the divergence theorem, we have

[formula]

The last equality is due to the fact that

[formula]

where G is the determinant of the metric (gij).

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm3]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm3] is similar as in [\cite=GWW] with a slight modification. For convenience of readers, we give a complete proof. By the equation [\eqref=key-equ1], integrating by parts gives that

[formula]

where ν is the inward normal of Σ.

By assumption each connected component of Σ is a level set of fα, we know that in Σ

Thus if we rotate the coordinates such that ν =  - e1 at a given point in Σ, then at that point there hold

[formula]

where Aab is the second fundamental form of the isometric embedding (Σ,h) into the Euclidean space [formula] with h the induced metric on Σ. In this section, we use the convention that [formula] stand for [formula] and [formula] stand for [formula].

Moreover, the nonzero components of the metric g of M are

[formula]

Using the expression of Pijkl, we have

[formula]

Now we calculate these six terms as follows.

[formula]

where H is the mean curvature of embedding (Σ,h) in [formula]. Putting these together, we obtain

[formula]

Since Σ is the level set of f, we can identify Σ with its graph. Thus (Σ,h) is also an isometric embedding in (M,g). Denote Ãab the second fundamental form of the embedding [formula]. Then a direct calculation gives that

[formula]

From the above formula, we can see that if |Df| =  +   ∞   on Σ, then Σ is area-minimizing horizon . In the next section, we will show that under the condition of Theorem [\ref=thm4], |Df| =  +   ∞   on Σ.

Denote [formula] the Riemannian curvature of Σ. Then by the Gauss equation we obtain

[formula]

and also

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Now we can write down

[formula]

Plugging these terms into [\eqref=eq1], we have

[formula]

which completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm3].

The proofs of Theorem [\ref=thm4] and Theorem [\ref=thm-penrose]

Since M extends to the boundary in a C2 fashion, the limit [formula] exists (could be +    ∞  ). In fact, we claim that under the condition of Theorem [\ref=thm4], the limit

[formula]

To prove this claim, we fix a point p∈∂Ω. Suppose on the contrary that [formula]. At the point p, as in the last section, we can rotate the coordinates such that [formula] forms the basis of the tangent space TpΣ.

Now by composing an orthogonal transformation of [formula] with [formula], we can assume that the straight line [formula] without loss of generality. Since the manifold [formula] is tangent to the cylinder Σ  ×  l, we know that [formula] is a basis of TpM.

On the other hand, recall that at any point where |Df|2 <  +   ∞  , i.e. fαi is finite, [formula] is another basis of TpM. But these two bases of TpM can not be represented mutually, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we prove the claim [\eqref=eq4]. From this claim, Theorem [\ref=thm4] follows immediately.

Assume each connected component Σi of the boundary ∂Ω is 3-convex and star-shaped, the Alexandrov-Fenchel ienquality [\cite=GL] (see also [\cite=CW]) gives that

[formula]

The equality holds if and only if Σi is a sphere. Recall that for nonnegative numbers [formula] and 0  ≤  β  ≤  1, we have the following algebraic inequality (see [\cite=HW2])

[formula]

If 0  ≤  β < 1, the equality holds if and only if at most one of ai is nonzero. Thus by summing [\eqref=eq-5-1], we obtain that

[formula]

Combining with Theorem [\ref=thm4], we get the Penrose inequality [\eqref=eq-penrose]. Moreover, if the equality holds, we have that the second Gauss-Bonnet curvature L2 vanishes on M and Σ has only one connected component and is a sphere.

Positive mass theorem and Penrose inequality in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity

In [\cite=GWW1], Ge-Wang-Wu obtained a positive mass theorem for asymptotically flat codimension one graph under the condition R + αL2  ≥  0 and a Penrose type inequality in the case α > 0, where α is a constant. In this section, we give a generalization of their result to arbitrary codimension graph.

Let n  ≥  4 and (Mn,g) be an asymptotically flat manifold of decay order [formula] and R + αL2 is integrable in (M,g). The Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet mass energy is defined by ([\cite=GWW1], see also [\cite=DT1] [\cite=DT2])

[formula]

Ge-Wang-Wu [\cite=GWW1] proved that mEGB is well-defined and is a geometric invariant on M.

Suppose (Mn,g) is a graph of a smooth asymptotically flat map [formula] of order [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] is expressed as in [\eqref=eq-L2]. In particular, when M has flat normal bundle as a submanifold of [formula] and R + αL2  ≥  0, we have

[formula]

Since [formula], under the condition [formula], we have

[formula]

Thus mADM = mEGB. From the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop-mass], one can also get

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

The rest of the proof is similar as Theorem [\ref=thm2], which we omit here.

Similarly as in section 4 and section 5, we can prove

Let [formula] be an open subset. Let [formula] be a continuous map that is constant along each connected component of the boundary Σ  =  ∂Ω and asymptotically flat in [formula] of order [formula]. Assume that the graph M of f extends C2 to its boundary ∂M. Assume further that along each connected component Σi of ∂M, the manifold [formula] is tangent to the cylinder Σ  ×  li, where li is a straight line of [formula]. Then

[formula]

where H and H3 are mean curvature and the 3-th mean curvature of the embedding Σ in [formula]. Moreover, if M has nonnegative R + αL2 and flat normal bundle, each connected components of the boundary Σ  =  ∂Ω is 3-convex and star-shaped, α  ≥  0, then

[formula]
