Gromov-Hausdorff collapsing of Calabi-Yau manifolds

Introduction

In this paper we continue our study in [\cite=GTZ] of the structure of collapsed Gromov-Hausdorff limits of Ricci-flat Kähler metrics on compact Calabi-Yau manifolds. Let M be a projective Calabi-Yau manifold of complex dimension m, with Ω a nowhere vanishing holomorphic m-form on M. Let N be a projective manifold of dimension 0 < n < m, and f:M  →  N be a holomorphic fibration (i.e., a surjective holomorphic map with connected fibers) whose general fibre is an abelian variety. Let α be an ample class on M, and let N0  ⊂  N be the Zariski open subset such that, for any y∈N0, My = f- 1(y) is smooth (and therefore Calabi-Yau). Let [formula] be the discriminant locus of the map f. Let α0 be an ample class on N, and t∈f*α0 + tα be the Ricci-flat Kähler metric given by Yau's Theorem [\cite=Ya] for t∈(0,1], which satisfies the complex Monge-Ampère equation

[formula]

By [\cite=To1] and [\cite=GTZ], t converges smoothly to f*ω on f- 1(K) for any compact K  ⊂  N0 as t  →  0, and on N0, where ω is the Kähler metric on N0 with

[formula]

obtained in [\cite=To1] and [\cite=ST2] (see also [\cite=ST1]), and ωWP is a Weil-Petersson semipositive form on N0 coming from the variation of the complex structures of the fibers My. Furthermore, the Ricci-flat metrics t have locally uniformly bounded curvature on f- 1(N0). Thanks to [\cite=To0] and [\cite=Z], the diameter of the metrics t satisfies

[formula]

for a constant C > 0 independent of t. Gromov's pre-compactness theorem (cf. [\cite=Gr1]) then implies that for any sequence tk  →  0, a subsequence of (M,tk) converges to a compact metric space (X,dX) in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense (a priori different subsequences could result in non-isometric limits). In our earlier work [\cite=GTZ] we proved that (N0,ω) can be locally isometrically embedded into (X,dX), with open dense image X0  ⊂  X, via a homeomorphism φ:N0  →  X0. The following questions remain open (see [\cite=To2] [\cite=To3]).

Is (X,dX) isometric to the metric completion of (N0,ω)?

Is the real Hausdorff codimension of [formula] at least 2?

Is X homeomorphic to N?

Note that (1) implies that there is no need to pass to any subsequence to obtain Gromov-Hausdorff convergence.

The first result of this paper is that all these questions have an affirmative answer if N has complex dimension 1.

If n = 1, then the Gromov-Hausdorff limit

[formula]

exists as t  →  0, and is isometric to the metric completion of (N0,ω). Furthermore, [formula] is a finite number of points, and X is homeomorphic to N.

In the case of non-collapsing limits, analogous results about metric completions have been obtained in [\cite=RZ] [\cite=RZ2] [\cite=RuZ], and homeomorphism results have been obtained in [\cite=DS] (see also [\cite=Tian]).

Now we drop the assumption that the dimension of N equals 1, and assume instead that M is irreducible (i.e., simply connected and not the product of two lower-dimensional complex manifolds) and that it admits a holomorphic symplectic form Θ, which is a non-degenerate holomorphic 2-form. In this case the complex dimension of M must be even, m = 2n, and (M,Θ) is called an irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifold. If f:M  →  N is a fibration as before, then it is known [\cite=Ma] that all smooth fibers My are complex n-tori, which are holomorphic Lagrangian, in the sense that Θ|My = 0. Also, the base manifold N is always biholomorphic to [formula] [\cite=Hw] [\cite=GL]. Furthermore, we have the nowhere vanishing holomorphic 2n-form Ω  =  Θn, and the Ricci-flat equation [\eqref=eq1] says exactly that the metrics t for any [formula] are all hyperkähler (i.e., their Riemannian holonomy equals Sp(n)).

In this case, the results of our previous work [\cite=GTZ] apply, and we have again that the Ricci-flat metrics t collapse smoothly with locally bounded curvature to a Kähler metric ω on N0, with the same properties as before. To state our next result, we need a few definitions. A Kähler metric ω on a complex manifold (N,J) is called a special Kähler metric [\cite=Fr] if there is a real flat torsion-free connection [formula] on M with [formula] and such that

[formula]

where [formula] is the extended deRham complex ([formula] since [formula] is flat), and we are viewing J as an element of Ω1(TN). This notion originated in the physics literature, and has been extensively studied, see e.g. [\cite=Co] [\cite=Fr] [\cite=Hi2] [\cite=LYZ] [\cite=Lu] [\cite=St]. In particular, a special Kähler manifold carries an affine structure (given by local flat Darboux coordinates), with respect to which the metric is a Hessian metric [\cite=CY] (i.e., its Riemannian metric in local Darboux coordinates is given by the Hessian of a real convex function), see [\cite=Fr]. Recall [\cite=CY] [\cite=Hi1] that a Hessian metric is called a Monge-Ampère metric if its determinant is a constant, and that an affine structure is called integral if its transition functions have integral linear part [\cite=Gro].

With these definitions in place, we can state our next result, which complements [\cite=GTZ]:

If M is an irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifold, and [formula] is a holomorphic Lagrangian fibration, then the limiting metric ω is a special Kähler metric on N0. Its associated affine structure is integral, and its Riemannian metric is a Monge-Ampère metric on N0.

These last two facts are intimately related to the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow picture of mirror symmetry [\cite=SYZ], and to a conjecture of Gross-Wilson [\cite=GW], [\cite=DB], Kontsevich-Soibelman [\cite=KS] and Todorov [\cite=Man] which predicts that collapsed Gromov-Hausdorff limits of unit-diameter Ricci-flat Kähler metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds which approach a large complex stucture limit should be half-dimensional Riemannian manifolds on a dense open set. Furthermore, this open set should carry an integral affine structure which makes the metric Monge-Ampère. And finally, the complement of this open set should have real Hausdorff codimension at least 2.

In our earlier work [\cite=GTZ] we proved the first part of this conjecture for families of hyperkähler manifolds satisfying some hypotheses. Theorem [\ref=theorem2] applied to that same setup proves the second part of this conjecture. The third part follows from Theorem [\ref=theorem1] in the case when n = 1, i.e., M is a K3 surface. This was proved by Gross-Wilson [\cite=GW] for elliptically fibered K3 surfaces over [formula] with only singular fibers of type I1, while our results here apply to all elliptically fibered K3 surfaces over [formula].

To prove Theorem [\ref=theorem1] we first use Hodge theory to derive precise asymptotics for the fiberwise integrals of the holomorphic volume form on M over the fibers My as y approaches a critical value for f. This is the content of section [\ref=sectvol]. We then use these asymptotics together with estimates from our previous work [\cite=GTZ] to complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem1] in section [\ref=sectpf1]. The proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem2] occupies section [\ref=sectpf2].

Volume asymptotics

In this section we derive asymptotics for the pushforward of the holomorphic volume form on a Calabi-Yau manifold which is the total space of a holomorphic fibration over a curve.

We fix M an m-dimensional non-singular projective Calabi-Yau manifold with holomorphic m-form Ω, N a non-singular projective algebraic curve, and assume that we have a surjective map f:M  →  N. Let D  ⊆  N be the discriminant locus of the map f.

By Hironaka's resolution of singularities, there is a birational morphism π:  →  M such that [formula] is non-singular and :  →  N is a normal crossings morphism, i.e., locally one can find coordinates [formula] on [formula] such that [formula] is given by [formula]. Note that the fibres may be non-reduced.

Let U be an open neighbourhood in N of a point y0∈D with U biholomorphic to the unit disc Δ. Let y be a holomorphic coordinate on U giving this biholomorphism taking the value 0 at y0. We write Ω also for the pull-back of Ω on M to [formula]. Define a real function φU on U by the identity

[formula]

The main result of this section is the following:

After possibly shrinking U, we obtain the estimate

[formula]

for some non-negative integer d and rational number α >  - 2 and for all 0  ≠  y∈U.

Let [formula] be a basepoint and let

[formula]

be the monodromy operator for a loop based at n0 around y0. By the Monodromy Theorem (see e.g., the appendix of [\cite=La]) T is quasi-unipotent with (Tβ - I)d = 0 for some positive integers d and β, and β is the least common multiple of the multiplicities of the irreducible components of the fibre over y0. Let Ū  =  Δ with coordinate w, and let μ:Ū  →  U be given by μ(w) = wβ.

Pull-back and normalize the family   →  N via the composition [formula], to obtain a family :  →  Ū. This has discriminant locus   =  μ- 1(y0) = {0} and [formula] now has the property that the monodromy around a loop in [formula] is unipotent.

Now the trivial vector bundle [formula] on Ūo comes with the Gauss-Manin connection, whose flat sections are sections of [formula]. It is standard that this vector bundle has a canonical extension to Ū, (see e.g., [\cite=Gr], Chapter IV) constructed as follows. Choosing a basepoint t0∈Ūo, let [formula] be a basis for Hm - 1(- 1(t0)). These extend to multi-valued flat sections of Hm - 1, which we write as ei(w). However,

[formula]

with N =  log T is in fact a single-valued holomorphic section of Hm - 1. We then extend Hm - 1 across Ū by decreeing these sections to form a holomorphic frame for the vector bundle. Call this extension Hm - 1Ū

It is then standard (see again [\cite=Gr], Chapter IV) that the Hodge bundle Fm - 1Ūo: = (f*Ωm - 1  /  Ū)|Ūo  ⊆  Hm - 1 has a natural extension Fm - 1Ū  ⊆  Hm - 1Ū to Ū.

Next note that the form

[formula]

is a well-defined section of *Ωm - 1- 1(U) / U and thus pulls back to a well-defined section ΩrelŪo of Fm - 1Ūo. Furthermore, the function φU given in the statement of the theorem satisfies at a point y∈U

[formula]

We will show that the section ΩrelŪo of Fm - 1Ūo extends to a meromorphic section of Fm - 1Ū and investigate the order of the pole of this section at μ- 1(y0).

Let [formula] denote the fibre of :  →  N over y0. We first determine the order of pole of Ωrel at 0 as a section of Ωm - 1 / N( log ). Locally on [formula], near a general point of an irreducible component of [formula], the map [formula] is given by [formula], with [formula] and [formula] coordinates on [formula]. We can write Ω as a form on [formula] locally as

[formula]

for some holomorphic function ψ. In our local coordinate description, the vector field on [formula] given by [formula] is a lift of ∂y. Thus Ωrel as a section of Ωm - 1 / N( log ) is locally given by

[formula]

This shows that we can consider Ωrel as a meromorphic section of Ωm - 1  /  N( log ), hence of *Ωm - 1 / N( log ).

We now need to pull-back Ωrel to ΩrelŪo and study this section as a section of Fm - 1Ū. To this end, we note that the stable reduction theorem [\cite=KKMS] gives a resolution of singularities '  →   such that the composed map '  →  Ū is normal crossings. So we have a diagram

[formula]

Furthermore, the map π' is a toric resolution of singularities by the construction of [\cite=KKMS], Chapter II. In particular, locally π' and π can be described as dominant morphisms of toric varieties of the same dimension. On such toric charts, by [\cite=Oda], Prop. 3.1, the sheaves of logarithmic differentials Ωm - 1 / N( log ),Ωm - 1  /  Ū( log ), and Ωm - 1' / Ū( log ') are trivial vector bundles generated by exterior products of logarithmic differentials of toric monomials, and thus [formula] and [formula]. Furthermore,

[formula]

It also follows from [\cite=Steen] (see also [\cite=Gr], Chapter VII) that

[formula]

Thus, in order to understand the behaviour of ΩrelŪo as a section of Fm - 1Ū, it is sufficient to pull back Ωrel to Ωm - 1  /  Ū( log ) and understand the behaviour of this form as a section of *Ωm - 1  /  Ū( log ).

Again, we do this locally near the inverse image of a general point of an irreducible component of [formula]. Using the same notation as before, we know that [formula] is locally given by the normalization of the equation [formula]. Note that [formula], so a local description of the normalization is given by an equation [formula] for ξ an [formula]-th root of unity. Thus Ωrel pulls back to

[formula]

Thus letting [formula] be the largest multiplicity of any irreducible component of [formula], we find [formula] extends to a holomorphic section of Ωm - 1  /  Ū( log ), hence yields a holomorphic section of Fm - 1Ū  =  '*Ωm - 1' / Ū( log ').

Now set

[formula]

This now extends to a holomorphic section of Fm - 1Ū. Thus we can write Ωnorm, as a section of Hm - 1Ū, as

[formula]

for hi holomorphic functions on Ū. We then compute, with 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 denoting the cup product followed by evaluation on the fundamental class

[formula]

that

[formula]

Note the exponentials can be expanded in a finite power series because N is nilpotent, and hence a term in the above expression is

[formula]

Here the constant C only depends on the powers d, d' occuring. We can assume that we have chosen the imaginary part of log w to lie between 0 and 2π (this is equivalent to choosing the branch of ei(y)). Keeping in mind that the hj are holomorphic on Ū, after shrinking Ū we can assume that |hj| are bounded by some constant, and so we see that the above term is bounded by a sum of a finite number of expressions of the form

[formula]

Thus the entire integral is bounded by an expression of the form

[formula]

for suitable choice of constant C and exponent d.

Returning to ΩrelŪo, we see that

[formula]

Using y = wβ then gives the result.

In fact, the volume asymptotics we just proved can be easily generalized to the case when the base N has arbitrary dimension m, but these estimates are not enough for the arguments in section [\ref=sectpf1] to go through.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem1]

In this section we use the results for section [\ref=sectvol] and give a proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem1].

Therefore assume that we are in the setting of Theorem [\ref=theorem1]. As explained for example in [\cite=To1], (especially equation (4.3)) the limiting metric ω satisfies the equation

[formula]

on N0. Now N is a compact Riemann surface, and therefore the discriminant locus [formula] is a finite set (here |D| denotes the cardinality of D). For any pk, there is a neighborhood Uk such that Uk admits a coordinate y, pk is given by y = 0, and [formula] does not belong to Uk if [formula]. Set U*k = Uk  -  {pk}. Let Ωy,k be a holomorphic relative volume form on f- 1(U*k) (i.e., a nowhere vanishing holomorphic section of the relative canonical bundle Kf- 1(U*k) / U*k) such that we have

[formula]

on f- 1(U*k). Then on U*k we have

[formula]

for C > 0 a fixed constant. Denote

[formula]

Thanks to [\eqref=eq3], [\eqref=eq4] and [\eqref=eq2], there is a constant C > 0 such that

[formula]

holds on U*k. For [formula], denote Δ*k(ρ) = {y∈Uk  |  0 < |y| < ρ}.

For each given [formula], there are constants C > 0, [formula], [formula] with α >  - 2, such that for any ρ > 0 sufficiently small and for any two points q1 and q2∈Δ*k(ρ), there is a curve γ  ⊂  Δ*k(ρ) connecting q1 and q2 such that

[formula]

Furthermore, the metric completion of (N0,ω) is a compact metric space homeomorphic to N.

Proposition [\ref=volest] applied to Uk, shows that there is a small ρ > 0 (which we can assume is less than e- 1) and there are constants C > 0, [formula], [formula] with α >  - 2, such that on Δ*k(ρ) we have

[formula]

Together with [\eqref=eq6], this gives

[formula]

on Δ*k(ρ). Here and in the following, we use C to denote a fixed positive constant, which may change from line to line. For any [formula], we set [formula], which for 0 < s < ρ gives a path in Δ*k(ρ). We also set S1(ρ) = {y∈Δ*k(ρ) |  |y| = ρ}. Then we use the fact that ρ  <  e- 1 so that [formula], and use repeated integration by parts to compute

[formula]

We also have that

[formula]

Hence for any q1,q2∈Δ*k(ρ), there is a curve γ  ⊂  Δ*k(ρ) connecting q1 and q2 such that

[formula]

when ρ  →  0, because α >  - 2. By repeating this argument near each point pk, it follows that

[formula]

where dω is the metric space structure on N0 induced by ω.

For any q∈N0, pk∈D, and a sequence qs  →  pk, the distance dω(q,qs) converges by passing to a subsequence. Define

[formula]

If qs'  →  pk is another sequence, then by passing to subsequences we can assume that qs and [formula] for all s large. Thanks to [\eqref=to0], we see that dω(qs,qs')  →  0. Thus dω(q,pk) does not depend on the choice of the sequence {qk}, and is well-defined. Similarly, we can define [formula] for any [formula], and we clearly have [formula] for [formula]. We obtain that dω is a compact metric space structure on (a space homeomorphic to) N which by definition is the metric completion of (N0,ω).

From now on we will denote by (N,dω) the metric completion of (N0,ω). Now pick any sequence tk  →  0 such that (M,tk) converges in the Gromov-Hausdorff topology to a compact length metric space (X,dX). As we recalled in the Introduction, in [\cite=GTZ] we constructed a local isometric embedding of (N0,ω) into (X,dX) with open dense image X0  ⊂  X via a homeomorphism φ:N0  →  X0.

The set [formula] is finite, with cardinality less than or equal to the cardinality of D.

The density of X0 implies that for every fixed ρ > 0 the set

[formula]

covers SX. Then the fact that (X,dX) is a length space implies that

[formula]

where the infimum is over all curves σ in X joining p and q. But p and q can be joined by curves of the form φ(γ), with γ  ⊂  Δ*k(ρ), and since φ is a local isometry we have that

[formula]

for any such curve γ. We can then use [\eqref=to0] and conclude that

[formula]

for all ρ > 0 small and for C > 0 independent of ρ. Since this approaches 0 as ρ  →  0, we conclude that the 0-dimensional Hausdorff measure of

[formula]

equals 1, and so this set is a single point xk. Therefore [formula] is a finite set. Note that a priori the points xk need not all be distinct.

The map φ extends to a surjective 1-Lipschitz map φ̃:N  →  X by letting φ̃(pk) = xk. Furthermore, if HβdX denotes the β-dimensional Hausdorff measure on X, then

[formula]

for [formula].

Note also that for any two points x,y∈N0 we have

[formula]

Indeed, for any ε > 0 there is a path [formula] in N0 joining x and y with [formula]. From [\eqref=lengthp] we see that

[formula]

and letting ε  →  0 proves [\eqref=length].

The map φ̃:(N,dω)  →  (X,dX) is an isometry. In particular we have [formula] for [formula].

If ν denotes the reduced measure in Section 5 of [\cite=GTZ], then ν(SX) = 0 [\cite=GTZ] and there exists a constant υ > 0 such that for any K  ⊂  N0,

[formula]

by ([\ref=eq3]). Thus

[formula]

for a constant λ > 0. Furthermore, ν is a Radon measure by [\cite=CC1]. It follows that for any Borel set A  ⊂  X we have

[formula]

and if we pick an exhaustion of [formula] by compact sets Ak  ⊂  N0 then we have

[formula]

because every Radon measure is inner regular. But since Ak is relatively compact in N0, we have ν(Ak) = λH2dX(Ak) for all k, and so

[formula]

because the Hausdorff measure H2dX is inner regular. Using [\eqref=measure], we conclude that

[formula]

i.e., that ν  =  λH2dX as measures. Recall from [\cite=CC2] the following construction: given a Borel measure μ on a metric space (Z,d) and a real number β the Hausdorff measure in codimension β is defined by

[formula]

for all subsets U of Z where

[formula]

and the infimum is over all coverings of U by balls Bi of radii ri  <  δ. Then μ-  β is a metric outer measure, whose associated Radon measure is also denoted by μ-  β. For example if μ  =  H2dZ then μ-  β is uniformly equivalent to H2 - βdZ.

Then from the equality of measures ν  =  λH2dX we deduce that

[formula]

because SX is a finite set. We can then apply [\cite=CC2], and see that given any x1∈X0 for H2dX-almost all y∈X0 there exists a minimal geodesic from x1 to y which lies entirely in X0. In particular, given any two points x1,x2∈X0 and δ > 0, there is a point y∈X0 with dX(x2,y) < δ which can be joined to x1 by a minimal geodesic σ1 contained in X0. Furthermore we can take y close enough to x2 so that it can also be joined to x2 by a curve σ2 contained in X0 with dX-length at most δ. Concatenating σ1 and σ2 we obtain a curve σ in X0 joining x1 to x2 with

[formula]

Since φ:N0  →  X0 is a homeomorphism, we conclude that given any two points q1,q2∈N0 and δ > 0, there is a curve γ in X0 joining q1 and q2 with

[formula]

Therefore, thanks to [\eqref=length], we conclude that

[formula]

Letting δ  →  0, we conclude that

[formula]

Thus the extension φ̃ is an isometry between (N,ω) and (X,dX).

From Lemma [\ref=isom] and Gromov's pre-compactness theorem, we immediately conclude that

[formula]

as t  →  0 without passing to subsequences. Putting together Lemmas [\ref=compl], [\ref=finite] and [\ref=isom] completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem1].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem2]

In this section we give the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem2].

Let (M,Θ) be an irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifold of dimension 2n as in the hypotheses. By normalizing Θ, we assume that lim t  →  0ct = 1. Then [formula] is a hyperkähler structure for any t, and

[formula]

Note that f:f- 1(N0)  →  N0 with holomorphic symplectic form Θ and polarization α is an algebraic integrable system as in [\cite=Fr]. By Section 3 in [\cite=Fr], there is a [formula]-lattice subbundle Λ  ⊂  T*N0 such that Λ is a holomorphic Lagrangian submanifold with respect to the canonical holomorphic symplectic form [formula] on T*N0. The holomorphic symplectic form [formula] induces a holomorphic symplectic form on T*N0  /  Λ, still denoted by [formula]. Furthermore, for any local Lagrangian section s:B  →  f- 1(B) where B  ⊂  N0, there is a biholomorphism Φs:T*B / Λ  →  f- 1(B) such that Φ*sΘ  =  , and Φ- 1s(s(B)) is the zero section. Since any two biholomorphisms induced by local sections differ by a translation on each fiber, the polarization α induces a polarization [formula] on T*N0  /  Λ. By choosing a local section s:B  →  f- 1(B), we will not distinguish between T*N0  /  Λ|B and f- 1(B), Θ and [formula], α and [formula].

Let B  ⊂  N0 be a subset biholomorphic to a polydisc Δn, and U = f- 1(B). The polarization α induces a symplectic basis [formula] of T*B, which generates Λ. If xi,xn + i denote the coordinates corresponding to the basis δi,ξi, i.e., [formula] for any p∈B, then there exist positive integers di such that

[formula]

is a Kähler metric on My which belongs to the class α|My, for any y∈B. If we denote ei = d- 1iδi, then ei is a Lagrangian section of T*B, which implies that there are coordinates [formula] on B such that ei  =  Re  dyi. Let [formula] be the coordinates corresponding to ei, i.e., the identification [formula] is given by [formula]. Then

[formula]

where [formula] is a holomorphic map for each i and we wrrite [formula]. Furthermore, the Riemann bilinear relations say that ZT = Z and Im  Z > 0.

Let ωSF be the semi-flat form constructed in [\cite=GTZ], which satisfies

[formula]

where y∈B. Following [\cite=GTZ], we define [formula] by [formula] and [formula]. It is proved in [\cite=GTZ] that

[formula]

in the C∞ topology where σ:B  →  U is a holomorphic section and Tσ:U  →  U is the fiberwise translation by σ. Note that

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

in the C∞ topology and

[formula]

Therefore (ωSF + f*ω,Θ) is a hyperkähler structure on T*B.

On B we have

[formula]

and ω is a special Kähler metric on N0.

Denote [formula], C = (Im  Z)- 1, and g the hyperkähler metric of (ωSF + f*ω,Θ). If x belongs the zero section Φ- 1s(s(B)), then, on Tx(T*B),

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. We can define one of the complex structures J on T*B compatible with the metric g by Re  Θ(  ·  ,  ·  ) = g(  ·  ,J  ·  ). We calculate that J acts as

[formula]

[formula]

From J2 =  - id, we obtain A = C- 1  =  Im  Z, and

[formula]

Note that ei = d- 1iδi and [formula], where IB is the complex structure on B. Then

[formula]

Then [\cite=Fr] shows that ω is a special Kähler metric on N0.

We now prove the last two statements in Theorem [\ref=theorem2]. Since δi and ξi are closed 1-forms, there are flat Darboux coordinates [formula] such that δi = dvi and ξi = dvn + i. Thanks to [\cite=Fr], the corresponding Riemannian metric gω is the Hessian of a smooth function G in the coordinates vi, i.e.,

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

Therefore gω is a Monge-Ampère metric. Finally, thanks to [\cite=Fr], the transition functions of two such coordinates vi and ṽi satisfy that

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. Thus these coordinates vi define an integral affine structure on N0. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem2].
