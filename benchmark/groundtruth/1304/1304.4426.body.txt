Submaximal metric projective and metric affine structures

Introduction

Consider a linear torsion-free connection Γ = (Γijk) on a smooth connected manifold Mn of dimension [formula]. A vector field v is called a projective symmetry, or a projective vector field, if its local flow sends geodesics (considered as unparameterized curves) to geodesics. Since S.Lie [\cite=L] it is known that projective vector fields form a Lie algebra, which we denote by [formula]. A vector field v is called an affine symmetry, or an affine vector field, if its local flow preserves Γ; affine vector fields also form a Lie algebra [formula], which we call affine algebra. Obviously [formula] is a subalgebra.

It follows from E.Cartan [\cite=C] that [formula] and a connection with the maximal dimension of the projective algebra is projectively flat, i.e. in a certain local coordinate system the geodesics are straight lines. I.Egorov [\cite=E$_1$] proved that the next possible dimension of [formula], the so-called submaximal dimension (this is the maximal dimension among all non-flat structures), is n2 - 2n + 5 for n > 2. For n = 2, it was known since S. Lie [\cite=L] and A.Tresse [\cite=T] that the submaximal dimension is 3.

However, for n > 2, the projective structures realizing this dimension are non-metric, in the sense there exists no (local) metric such that its Levi-Civita connection has [formula]. This observation follows for example from [\cite=EM], which can be viewed as a system of linear equations on the components of the metric g, whose coefficients come from the components of the projective Weyl tensor W. By Egorov [\cite=E$_1$], in a certain coordinate system the connection with the submaximal dimension of the projective algebra has only two non-zero term Γ123  =  Γ132 = x2. Direct calculation shows that the only nonvanishing components of the projective Weyl tensor are W1232 = 1 =  - W1322; substitution of this into [\cite=EM] yields a system of linear equations such that any solution g is a degenerate symmetric tensor.

Non-metrizability of the Egorov's submaximal projective structure was obtained independently (and by another method) by S.Casey and M.Dunajski. In fact, it follows instantly from our first main result (below δ2n is the Kronecker symbol, i.e. 1 for n = 2 and 0 else):

Let Γ be the Levi-Civita connection of a metric g on Mn. Assume that Γ is not projectively flat at least at one point (i.e. g is not a metric of constant sectional curvature). Then the maximal possible dimension of the symmetry algebra [formula] is equal to

n2 - 3n + 5,  if g has Riemannian signature,

n2 - 3n + 6 - δ2n,  if g has Lorentzian signature,

n2 - 3n + 8,  if g has the general signature.

The bound for the general signature was obtained by Mikes [\cite=Mi$_1$]. Our approach however differs from his.

Notice that in the global setting, i.e. if we replace the projective algebra by a projective group, the sub-maximal projective connection is metric. The reason is that there are locally-projectively-flat manifolds whose projective group actually has dimension n2 + n [\cite=Y] (this is the global submaximal bound).

If M is closed and the metric g is Riemannian of non-constant sectional curvature, then the sub-maximal bound is [formula] for all n  ≠  4; for n = 4 this dimension is [formula]. Indeed by [\cite=M$_1$] [\cite=M$_2$], on closed Riemannian manifolds of nonconstant sectional curvature, the projective group acts by isometries, so the claim follows from [\cite=Yan] [\cite=E$_2$] [\cite=KN]. The corresponding models are precisely [formula] for n  ≠  4, possibly quotient by a finite group, and [formula] for n = 4.

The problem of determining the dimension gaps (lacunes in the terminology of the Russian geometry school) between the maximal and sub-maximal structures is classical, see the discussion in [\cite=K$_2$].

Let us now discuss an analogous question for the affine algebra. The maximal dimension of the space of affine symmetries of an affine connection is classically known to be n2 + n. The submaximal dimension is n2 and this was also found by I.Egorov [\cite=E$_3$]. The corresponding connections are projectively flat, and for projectively non-flat connections the affine algebra has maximal dimension n2 - 2n + 5, n > 2 [\cite=E$_1$] (it equals 3 for n = 2). Again, all these submaximal connections are non-metric.

Our second main result concerns submaximal dimensions of the affine algebras [formula] of Levi-Civita connections Γ.

Non-flat metrics g on a manifold Mn have maximal dimension of the affine algebra [formula] equal to

n2 - 3n + 5 + δ3n  +  δ4n,  if g has Riemannian signature,

n2 - 3n + 6 - δ2n,  if g has Lorentzian signature,

n2 - 3n + 8,  if g has the general signature.

In the process of the proof of Theorems [\ref=Thm1] and [\ref=Thm2] we essentially describe all metrics for the submaximal dimension of the projective and affine algebras of a metric connection.

Throughout the paper, all our considerations are local (so isomorphisms to the models are understood locally).

Let us finally specify the gap [formula] between the maximal dimension of the projective algebra and the submaximal one, and the gap [formula] between the submaximal projective and submaximal metric projective dimensions (of un-restricted signature):

For affine algebras the corresponding gaps are the following (with the obvious modification to define [formula])

Degree of mobility and useful estimates.

Two metrics g and [formula] on a manifold M are projectively equivalent, if any g-geodesic is a reparameterization of a [formula]-geodesic. This can be expressed [\cite=S$_2$] through the (1,1)-tensor [formula], where [formula] is the inverse of [formula] (ikkj  =  δij), and [formula] is the contraction ([formula]): the metrics g and [formula] are geodesically equivalent if and only if

[formula]

In the coordinate-free notation the above formula reads

[formula]

Dimension D(g) of the solution space [formula] of this linear PDE system on unknown a is called the degree of mobility of g.

Let us denote by I(g) the algebra of infinitesimal isometries (Killing vector fields), by H(g) the algebra of homotheties, and by C(g) the algebra of the conformal vector fields. These are given by the equation Lvg  =  λ  ·  g on the vector field v, where λ is respectively zero, a constant or an arbitrary function. Clearly I(g)  ⊆  H(g)  ⊆  C(g).

In this paper we shall actively use the following two estimates due to [\cite=Mi$_1$]:

[formula]

Let us prove these estimates (our proof is different from that of Mikes and is much simpler). It is well known (see [\cite=M$_2$] and references therein) that [formula] iff

[formula]

is a solution of ([\ref=sin]). Denote by [formula] the linear map sending v to the right hand side of ([\ref=Lvg]). Since [formula], the rank theorem yields inequality [\eqref=est1].

In order to obtain the second estimate, we observe that ([\ref=sin]) has the obvious one-dimensional subspace of constant solutions [formula]. Let [formula] be the projection. Then the linear map [formula] has kernel H(g) and [\eqref=est2] follows.

Below we will use the following results on the degree of mobility. It is always is bounded so:

[formula]

the equality corresponds to the space of constant curvature [\cite=S$_2$]. The next biggest (submaximal) dimension in any signature is [\cite=Mi$_2$]:

[formula]

Finally, let us recall from [\cite=KM] that if the Weyl conformal curvature tensor of the metric g vanishes, but g is not of constant sectional curvature, then D(g)  ≤  2.

Riemannian case, dimension n > 3

In this section we assume that the metric is Riemannian, n > 3. Denote by Snc the space form of constant curvature c, i.e. the sphere [formula] of radius c > 0, the Euclidean space [formula] for c = 0, or the hyperbolic space [formula] for c < 0 equipped with the standard metrics.

Riemannian manifolds with abundant isometries were studied (among others) by H.C.Wang [\cite=W], K.Yano [\cite=Yan], I.Egorov [\cite=E$_2$], S.Kobayashi and T.Nagano [\cite=KN]. According to the local versions of their results, the Riemannian metrics g of non-constant sectional curvature on Mn with [formula], n > 2, are contained in the following list (see the Appendix for details):

[formula], n = 4. The corresponding g is a Kähler metric on a complex surface with constant nonzero holomorphic sectional curvature (e.g. Fubini-Study metric on [formula]).

[formula]. The corresponding g is the standard metric on the product [formula] ([formula]).

[formula]. The corresponding g = dt2 + a(t)2ds20 is the warped product metric, where ds20 is the standard metric on Sn - 1c and a(t) is a generic function (such that g is not of constant sectional curvature and not as in (b)).

[formula], n = 6. M is a Kähler manifold of complex dimension 3 of constant nonzero holomorphic sectional curvature.

[formula]. The corresponding [formula], and the constants c, are not simultaneously zero.

[formula], n = 8. The corresponding M is a Kähler manifold of complex dimension 4 with constant nonzero holomorphic sectional curvature.

In all these cases, except possibly (c1), H(g) = I(g). Thus the submaximal dimension of the homothety algebra is [formula] for [formula]. Consequently in the cases (b) and (c1), where the metric g is conformally flat and so [formula], we obtain from ([\ref=est2]):

[formula]

Consider the spaces (a,c2,d2) of nonzero constant holomorphic sectional curvature. Then D(g) = 1 (since it is always so for the irreducible symmetric spaces [\cite=S$_1$]) and we conclude similarly that [formula] is strictly less than the bound from Theorem [\ref=Thm1].

For the case (d1) we have, combining ([\ref=est2]) and ([\ref=MiK]):

[formula]

Finally, if [formula], then [formula]. Indeed, if I(g) acts transitively, then H(g) = I(g) unless the metric is flat everywhere. In the intransitive case, M is (locally) foliated by dimension (n - 1) leaves, to which the Killing fields are tangent. On these leaves (restriction to them uniquely determines the Killing field [\cite=KN]) the metric is not of constant sectional curvature (otherwise we have the case (c)), and thus [formula]. So in this case [formula] is strictly less than the bound of Theorem [\ref=Thm1].

It follows from the above estimates and the analysis of the obtained models that the equality for n > 3 is attained only in the following sub-case of (d1):

[formula]

(in the case of the second factor [formula] having curvature [formula] all projective transformations are isometries). The projective transformations of this M consist of 3-dimensional space of isometries of the first factor (that is so(3) or sl(2) for c > 0 or c < 0 respectively) plus arbitrary affine transformations x  ↦  A  ·  x + b of the second.

Lorentzian signature, dimension n > 3

In this section we consider Lorentzian manifolds of dimension n > 3. Complete classification of such metrics with the largest dimensions of I(g) is not known to us, so we approach the problem differently.

It is still true that for g of non-constant sectional curvature dim I(g) does not exceed [formula] in the Lorentzian signature (in fact, the inequality fails only when n = 4 for the Riemannian and split signature [\cite=E$_3$]). If the metric g is conformally flat, but not of constant sectional curvature, then by ([\ref=est1]) we get

[formula]

On the other hand, if (M,g) is not conformally flat, then by [\cite=DT] [formula] and so, using ([\ref=est2]) and ([\ref=MiK]), we get

[formula]

This estimate is achieved on the Lorentzian pp-wave metric, trivially extended to dimension n, [formula], see [\cite=KT]:

[formula]

This metric has [formula] Killing vector fields

[formula]

1 pure homothety

[formula]

and [formula] pure affine fields

[formula]

(the latter is easy to check as the connection is rather simple: Γ123  =  Γ132 = 2z, Γ322 =  - z and the other Christoffel symbols are zero). There are no non-affine projective fields. Thus the totality of the linearly independent projective symmetries is [formula]. This proves the claim for n > 3.

Let us note that the submaximal model described above is (visibly) not unique. We can take any metric from the list of Krukovi [\cite=Kr] (see Section [\ref=S4.5]) that has 4 Killing fields and 1 essential homothety/affine field, and extend it trivially to n dimensions, achieving the same result: The new metric g will have (n - 2)-dimensional space of parallel vector fields, yielding (n - 1)(n - 2) affine symmetries, to which we add the 4 fields coming from the 3D metric (3 Killing fields + 1 homothety, as one Killing field that is parallel was already counted). All maximal models are obtained in this way (this observation is based on the fact [\cite=FM] that parallel (0,2) tensors are linear combinations of symmetric products of parallel vectors).

Finally we remark that [formula] for all Lorenzian metrics g of submaximal dimension of the projective algebra. Indeed, if there was an essentially projective symmetry, then by [\cite=FM]

[formula]

According to [\cite=DT] for a conformally non-flat metric g [formula]. It also follows from the construction of loc.cit. that at any point x∈M the grading 0 component [formula] of the (associated graded to the naturally filtered) symmetry group [formula] satisfies: [formula]. Thus I(g)  ≠  C(g) and so [formula]. Combining this estimate, ([\ref=FeM]) and ([\ref=MiK]) we obtain [formula], which contradicts submaximality of the projective algebra.

The proof for the general signature

Consider now the metric of signature (p,q), where both [formula], so [formula]. If the metric g is conformally flat and not of constant sectional curvature, then by ([\ref=est1]) we get

[formula]

Next, by the results of [\cite=KT], for non-conformally flat metric structure we have

[formula]

and so, using H(g)  ⊆  C(g), by ([\ref=est1]) and ([\ref=MiK]) we get

[formula]

The equality is attained on the metric of the split signature pp-waves trivially extended from 4 to n dimensions:

[formula]

This metric has conformal Weyl curvature tensor [formula], and is Einstein (Ricci-flat). Moreover the projective symmetries coincide with its affine symmetries. We have C(gpp) = H(gpp), and the generators of this algebra were calculated in [\cite=KT]: In addition, gpp has the following genuine affine symmetries (not homotheties) Thus the total number of linearly independent projective symmetries is [formula] as required in Theorem [\ref=Thm1].

Dimension n = 3

Consider the special case n = 3, where g necessarily has Riemannian or Lorentzian signature.

In this dimension the Weyl conformal curvature vanishes identically, and so (even for non-conformally flat metrics) D(g)  ≤  2, see [\cite=KM]. Since the submaximal [formula] we get by ([\ref=est1]): [formula].

On the other hand, in the Riemannian case [formula], so ([\ref=est1]) implies [formula]. Also if g is not conformally flat, then [formula] by [\cite=KT]. Henceforth we get the bound [formula] in this case too.

The local metrics in 3 dimensions with dim I(g) = 4 were classified by G.Krukovi [\cite=Kr]. There are 8 different cases. The first three are the Lorentzian metrics:

g1 = k  dx2 + 2(2 - c)ecx  dx  dy + e2xdz2,  ([formula])

g2 = k  dx2 + e2x(2  dx  dy - dz2),

[formula].

For all these metrics dim I(g) = 4, dim H(g) = 5, D(g) = 2, so both estimates ([\ref=est1]) and ([\ref=est2]) state [formula].

And in fact, this bound is achieved for all 3 cases. The infinitesimal automorphisms can be shown explicitly. For instance, for the first metric g1 ([formula]) the algebra of projective symmetries has generators

[formula]

The first four are Killing fields, the fifth is a homothety and the last is a projective field for the metric g (in fact it is an affine field for g).

For c = 0 the homothety has to be changed to [formula], and the genuine projective field has to be changed to 2y  ∂y + z  ∂z.

These formulae were obtained using the DifferentialGeometry package of Maple, and can be easily verified by hand. The formulae for g2 and g3 are obtained similarly.

The other metrics (4)-(8) in [\cite=Kr] can be of both possible signatures.

The metrics of cases (4), (5) and (6) in the list of Krukovi are not conformally flat, and for them direct calculation yields H(g) = I(g), D(g) = 1. Thus by ([\ref=est2]) we get [formula], i.e. all projective transformations in these cases are isometries, and the metrics are not of submaximal projective symmetry.

The metrics in cases (7) and (8) of loc.cit. are conformally flat, but for them H(g) = I(g), D(g) = 2, whence [formula]. In fact, in these cases the manifold is locally [formula], where [formula]. There is one genuine affine symmetry (scaling along [formula]), so we have [formula]. Again for the Lorentzian signature these M3 are not submaximal, but for Riemannian signature they are. This finishes investigation of the 3-dimensional case.

Dimension n = 2

Dimension 2 is another exception to the above arguments. Again here the problem is classical: the 2D projective structures were studied by S. Lie [\cite=L], R. Liouville [\cite=Li] and A. Tresse [\cite=T]. In the latter reference it was proven that the submaximal dimension of the symmetry algebra is 3 and the submaximal projective structures were classified.

The two projective structures arising in this way (see also [\cite=Ma]), when written as the 2nd order ODE on the plane, are

[formula]

It is easy to check they are metrizable; the corresponding metrics are

[formula]

The projective symmetry algebra is sl(2) realized on the plane [formula] via the vector fields ∂y,  x  ∂x + y  ∂y,  2xy  ∂x + y2∂y.

Another form of ([\ref=LLT]) was considered in [\cite=BMM]: [formula]. It is obtained from ([\ref=LLT]) by the transformation x  ↦    -  εex.

Yet in [\cite=K$_1$] this projective connection was written differently:

[formula]

The symmetry algebra sl(2) in this realization has the standard linear representation on [formula]: x  ∂x - y  ∂y, x  ∂y, y  ∂x. A metric corresponding to this projective connection is

[formula]

The complete list of the corresponding metrics is contained in [\cite=BMM].

This finishes the proof of Theorem [\ref=Thm1].

Affine symmetries of a metric

In this Section we prove Theorem [\ref=Thm2], estimating [formula].

Recall that (for any [formula]) if the Levi-Civita connection Γ of the metric g is projectively flat, then g has constant curvature. This is a variant of Beltrami's theorem, see [\cite=EM]. Thus if g is not of constant sectional curvature, we get the bound

[formula]

where σ = 5, 6 or 8 is the same number, depending on the signature of g and dimension n of M, as in Theorem [\ref=Thm1].

We have to show that this bound is achieved within the class of metrics of nonconstant sectional curvature. But indeed, the submaximal projective symmetry algebras of the models, studied in the preceding sections consisted of affine fields only, provided n > 2. Thus we conclude that the bound is actually sharp in the considered class.

If g has nonzero constant sectional curvature (in this case [formula] is also less than the maximal value n2 + n), then [formula] and we get

[formula]

For [formula] and for n = 2 this does not exceed the first bound (and is strictly less than it for n > 5) in the Riemannian case, and it never exceeds it (for n > 4, is strictly less than it) for the Lorentzian signature. For the Riemannian signature and n = 3,4 the bound in ([\ref=bound1]) exceeds the bound in ([\ref=bound2]) by 1. Thus in this case the constant sectional curvature spaces give the submaximal dimension of [formula].

In the general signature (p,q), [formula], [formula], the bound of ([\ref=bound2]) is strictly less than that of ([\ref=bound1]), thus nothing new is added here.

Dimension 2 is again special. If the affine connection is not flat, then [formula]. Indeed, since the curvature is nonzero, the holonomy algebra is full. The maximal dimension of H(g) in the case of non-constant scalar curvature is 2 (this is achieved, for example, in the case of metric ([\ref=2D]) via its first two symmetries). Consequently the submaximal dimension of [formula] is 3 and is achieved for the round sphere, the Lobachevsky plane or de Sitter metric. Herewith the claim is proved.

Local version of Kobayashi-Nagano 1972

In [\cite=KN] the Riemannian manifolds (Mn,g) with the abundant groups G of isometries (namely those with [formula]) were classified. We explain here that their results hold true locally.

If the algebra I(g) of symmetries of a Riemannian metric g has dimension [formula], then (M,g) is locally isomorphic to one of the models from the list (a)-(d) indicated in Section [\ref=S2].

The main difference of the local and global approaches is the usage of group methods, and these in [\cite=KN] enter via the stabilizer Gx of the point x∈M (see Lemmata 2.4 and 2.8 in loc.cit.). To adapt the notations to the local setting and establish their properties consider the orthogonal frame bundle π:G  →  M (= principal SO(n)-bundle) with the Cartan form ω∈Ω1(G,E(n)), [formula], giving the absolute parallelism. We will write Fx  =  π- 1(x)≃SO(TxM).

Let OMx denote the germ of neighborhoods of x in M and OGFx the germ of neighborhoods of Fx in G. Denote

[formula]

the x-stalk of the sheaf of the symmetries of g and

[formula]

the x-stalk of the sheaf of the local isometries of g. We can suppose that all the transformations φ are defined on the same neighborhood Uε  =  π- 1(Bε(x)), where Bε(x) is the ball of small radius ε around x∈M with respect to the metric g; then φ:Uε  →  Uε. Notice that φ0:Ox  →  Ox given by [formula] satisfies φ*0g = g.

Since an isometry is uniquely determined by its 1-jet, the topology on Gx is induced from embedding into the space J1x(M,M). Similarly, Ix has the natural topology of a finite-dimensional vector space.

The following is a local version of the Myers-Steenrod theorem.

The connected component G0x of unity in Gx is isomorphic to the closed subgroup in SO(TxM) generated by exp (v), v∈Ix(g).

Following the proof of Theorem 3.2 [\cite=Ko] we establish that Gx is the compact Lie group defined by the property that φ∈Gx iff φ  ·   exp (ξ) =  exp (ξ)  ·  φ for any parallel vector field w.r.t. the absolute parallelism, [formula]. The map φ  ↦  φ(u), u∈Fx is an embedding of Gx into Fx and its image is a closed (hence compact) submanifold. Thus we can identify Gx and also G0x as Lie subgroups in SO(TxM).

Denote the embedding by ι. By Palais theorem [\cite=Ko] Ix coincides with the Lie algebra of ι(Gx).

Indeed, the vector fields v∈Ix lift naturally to vector fields in G tangent to Fx. Denote by [formula] the lifted field v restricted to Fx. The homomorphism [formula], v  ↦  , is injective. We claim that it is surjective. Indeed, if dim Ix  <   dim Gx, then there exists a 1-parameter group exp (tw)∈Gx, [formula], with the property exp (tw)*g = g (here we identify the vector field w on Ox and its lift to GFx), whence Lwg = 0 and so w∈Ix - a contradiction.

Thus dim Ix  =   dim Gx and so the group generated by exp (), v∈Ix, coincides with the (connected) Lie subgroup ι(G0x)  ⊂  SO(TxM).

Now rest of the exposition in [\cite=KN] can be easily adapted to the local setting: Every time the stabilizer Gx occurs, it should be understood in the above sense. The group ι(G0x) act by isometries on the unit sphere Sn - 1  ⊂  TxM and the basic reduction argument of loc.cit. goes through.

The group orbits in M locally have to be understood as germs of submanifolds, and consideration of various discrete subgroups can be ignored. No other global arguments is contained in [\cite=KN]. This finishes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm3].
