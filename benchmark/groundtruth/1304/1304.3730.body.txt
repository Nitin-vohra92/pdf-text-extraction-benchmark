Aspherical manifolds that cannot be triangulated

Introduction

Any 3-dimensional homology sphere, H3, bounds a PL 4-manifold, W4, with vanishing first and second Stiefel-Whitney classes. The intersection form of W4 is then unimodular and even; so, its signature, σ(W4), is divisible by 8. If H3 is the standard 3-sphere, then, by Rokhlin's Theorem, σ(W4) is divisible by 16. So, one defines the μ-invariant of H3 by

[formula]

Let θH3 be the abelian group (under connected sum) of homology cobordism classes oriented PL homology 3-spheres. The μ-invariant defines a homomorphism [formula]. (For background about this material, see [\cite=sav].)

In [\cite=ks] Kirby and Siebenmann proved that for any topological manifold Mn there is an obstruction [formula] which, for n  ≥  5, vanishes if and only if Mn admits a PL structure. An important point here is that the Kirby-Siebenmann obstruction can be defined for any polyhedral homology manifold Mn, as follows. First, there is obstruction in H4(Mn;θH3) to finding an acyclic resolution of M by a PL manifold. This is the class of the cocycle that associates to each 4-dimensional "dual cell" in Mn the class of its boundary in θH3. The Kirby-Siebenmann obstruction Δ is the image of this element of H4(Mn;θH3) under the coefficient homomorphism [formula].

After the proof by Edwards and Cannon of the Double Suspension Theorem, it seemed possible that every topological manifold could still be homeomorphic to some simplicial complex, even if it did not have a PL structure. Galewski-Stern [\cite=gsannals] [\cite=gsams] and independently Matumoto [\cite=matumoto] proved that the following statements are equivalent: Galewski-Stern also showed that, for n  ≥  5, the obstruction for a manifold to have a simplicial triangulation was the Bockstein of its Kirby-Siebenmann obstruction, [formula], where [formula] denotes the Bockstein homomorphism associated to the short exact sequence of coefficients,

[formula]

In fact, as was shown in [\cite=gsuniversal], one can focus instead on a simpler Bockstein associated to the short exact sequence ofcoefficients,

[formula]

As is well-known, the Bockstein associated to [\eqref=e:usual] is the first Steenrod square, [formula]. So, henceforth we will use [formula] instead of a more general Bockstein β. The reduction to the case of [formula] goes as follows. Suppose Nn is a manifold with [formula]. By [\cite=gsuniversal], if one such Nn can be triangulated, then every manifold of dimension ≥  5 can be triangulated (this is statement (a) above). In [\cite=gsuniversal] Galewski-Stern also constructed n-manifolds, for each n  ≥  5, with [formula].

Manolescu has recently established that homology 3-spheres satisfying (b) do not exist [\cite=mano]. It follows that any manifold with [formula] is not homeomorphic to a simplicial complex. So the Galewski-Stern manifolds cannot be triangulated.

By work of Freedman and Casson nontriangulable manifolds exist in dimension 4 (cf. [\cite=am]). First, Freedman [\cite=freedman] showed that any homology 3-sphere bounds a contractible (topological) 4-manifold. One defines the E8-homology manifold X4 as follows. Start with the plumbing Q(E8) defined by the E8 diagram. It is a smooth, parallelizable 4-manifold with boundary; its boundary being Poincaré's homology 3-sphere, H3. The signature of Q(E8) is 8. X4 is defined to be the union of this plumbing with c(H3) (the cone on H3). It is a polyhedral homology 4-manifold with one non-manifold point. By [\cite=freedman] we can topologically "resolve the singularity" of X4 by replacing c(H3) with a contractible 4-manifold bounded by H3 to obtain a topological 4-manifold M4 with nontrivial Kirby-Siebenmann invariant. M4 cannot be triangulated. (Proof: For any triangulation of M4, the link of a vertex is a simply connected 3-dimensional homology sphere; so, by Perelman's proof of the Poincaré Conjecture, it is S3. Alternatively, since the Casson invariant of any homotopy 3-sphere is 0, so is its μ-invariant. So any triangulation of M4 would automatically be PL, contradicting Rokhlin's Theorem.) A variation of this idea was used in [\cite=dj] to produce an aspherical 4-manifold that cannot be triangulated. Start with a triangulation of X4. Apply the technique of [\cite=dj] to X4 to get its "hyperbolization" h(X4). It is a [formula] polyhedral homology manifold with one non-manifold point, the link of which is H3. Resolve the conical singularity to obtain a closed aspherical topological manifold N4 with Δ(N4)  ≠  0. By the previous argument, N4 cannot be triangulated. (Of course, N4  ×  S1 can be triangulated since it is homeomorphic to the triangulated manifold X4  ×  S1.)

The idea of this paper is to apply hyperbolization techniques to the Galewski-Stern manifolds to obtain aspherical manifolds Nn that cannot be triangulated. We do not know how to make our techniques work in dimension 5; however, they do work in any dimension ≥  6. So, we get the following.

For each n  ≥  6 there is a closed aspherical manifold Nn that cannot be triangulated.

The construction

The Galewski-Stern [formula]-manifold.

We recall the Galewski-Stern construction in [\cite=gsuniversal] of a 5-manifold, N5, now known to be nontriangulable. Start with X4  ×  I, where X4 is the E8-homology manifold. Attach an orientation-reversing 1-handle, D3  ×  I, connecting the two copies of c(H3) along their boundary. The two copies of Q(E8) become the boundary connected sum Q(E8)  #  b  Q(E8); it is a 4-manifold with boundary, the boundary being H3  #  H3 (not H3  #  ( - H3)). Consider [formula]. It is a contractible polyhedral homology 4-manifold; its boundary is H3  #  H3. Fill in the boundary with c(H3  #  H3) to obtain a polyhedral homology manifold T with the homology of S4 (i.e., a "generalized homology 4-sphere"). Next fill in T with c(T). The result is the polyhedral 5-manifold with boundary

[formula]

Roughly speaking, after ignoring the differences between homology spheres and spheres, we have attached an orientation-reversing 1-handle D4  ×  I to X4  ×  I (the 1-handle is actually c(T)). So, P5 is a nonorientable, polyhedral homology 5-manifold with boundary; it is homotopy equivalent to [formula]. The boundary of P5 is [formula]; so, ∂P5 contains a single non-manifold point (the cone point of c(H3  #  H3)). By Edwards' Polyhedral-Topological Manifold Characterization Theorem [\cite=edwards], the interior of P5 is a topological manifold. Its Kirby-Siebenmann invariant, Δ(P5), is the image of

[formula]

Galewski-Stern manifolds of dimension [formula].

In dimensions > 5 there are versions of these manifolds to which it is easier to apply hyperbolization. To fix ideas, suppose the dimension is 6. Let P': = P5  ×  S1, where P5 is the polyhedral homology 5-manifold with boundary which was constructed previously. Then Δ(P') is the nontrivial element in [formula], a summand of [formula]. It is the image of the unique nontrivial element Δ(P',∂P') of [formula]. Its image under [formula] is denoted [formula]. By Edwards' Theorem, ∂P' is a topological 5-manifold. Since Δ(∂P') is zero, ∂P' is actually homeomorphic to a PL 5-manifold V'. It is easy to see that V' bounds a PL 6-manifold W'. Put

[formula]

where U is the mapping cylinder of a homeomorphism between ∂P' and V' = ∂W'. Since Δ(N') restricts to Δ(P'), we have Δ(N')  ≠  0 and one sees as before that Δ(N') is the image of

[formula]

By Wu's Formula, [formula]. (This argument is from the final paragraph of [\cite=gsuniversal].) Hence, [formula] is the nonzero image of [formula].

Hyperbolization.

A hyperbolization technique of Gromov [\cite=gromov] is explained in [\cite=dj]: given a simplicial complex K, one can construct a new space h(K) and a map f:h(K)  →  K with the following properties.

In [\cite=djw] the above version of hyperbolization is used to define a "relative hyperbolization procedure" (an idea also due to Gromov [\cite=gromov]). Given (K,∂K), a triangulated manifold with boundary, form [formula] and then define H(K,∂K) to be the complement of an open neighborhood of the cone point in [formula]. Then H(K,∂K) is a manifold with boundary; its boundary is homeomorphic to ∂K. The main result of [\cite=djw] is that if each component of ∂K is aspherical, then so is H(K,∂K); moreover, the inclusion ∂K  →  H(K,∂K) induces an injection on fundamental groups for each component of ∂K. In other words, if a triangulated aspherical manifold bounds a triangulated manifold, then it bounds an aspherical manifold.

Our nontriangulable 6-manifold N6 will be the union of three pieces, [formula], where P1 and P2 are triangulable, aspherical 6-manifolds with boundary, and where U is the mapping cylinder of a homeomorphism ∂P1  →  ∂P2. P1 will be defined via hyperbolization and P2 via relative hyperbolization. Put P1: = h(P'), where P' = P5  ×  S1 is the simplicially triangulated 6-manifold with boundary discussed above. Then P1 is a topological 6-manifold with boundary and ∂P1 = h(∂P') is homeomorphic to a PL 5-manifold V. (N.B. the PL structure on V is incompatible with the triangulation of ∂P1 as a subcomplex of P1.) Let U be the mapping cylinder of a homeomorphism h(∂P')  →  V. Let W be a PL manifold bounded by V. Equip W with a PL triangulation. Applying relative hyperbolization, we get an aspherical 6-manifold with boundary P2: = H(W,V); its boundary being V. Then [formula] is aspherical. By properties (c) and (d) of hyperbolization, Δ(P1,∂P1) = f*(Δ(P',∂P')). So, [formula]. Consequently, Δ(P1,∂P1) and [formula] are both nonzero. Since P2 is a PL manifold, its obstructions vanish. As before, it follows that Δ(N6) and [formula] are both nonzero.

(a) What is the situation in dimension 5? As explained in the Introduction, any polyhedral homology 4-manifold, M4, can be resolved to a topological manifold [formula]. When P5 is defined by [\eqref=e:p], [formula] does not support a PL structure (although [formula]). However, one can vary the definition of P so that [formula] becomes homeomorphic to a PL 4-manifold. To complete our construction we need [formula], the resolution of the hyperbolization, to be PL. If this could be achieved, we could finish by finding a PL 5-manifold bounded by [formula] and applying relative hyperbolization as before.

(b) The Galewsi-Stern 5-manifold is nonorientable. (In fact, Siebenmann showed in [\cite=sieb] that every orientable 5-manifold can be triangulated.) Since our construction of a nontriangulable aspherical manifold N6 starts from P5  ×  S1, the manifold N6 is also nonorientable (by property (e) of hyperbolization). The question arises: do orientable examples exist? The answer is yes. To construct one, start from the nonorientable S1-bundle over P instead of P  ×  S1, where w1 of the associated vector bundle is w1(P). The total space E of the S1-bundle is then a 6-dimensional, orientable, polyhedral homology manifold with boundary. The restriction of the S1-bundle to ∂P is orientable so ∂E = ∂P  ×  S1 is the same. As before, we get [formula] where P1 = h(E), V is a PL-manifold manifold homeomorphic to ∂P1, W is a PL manifold bounded by V, P2 = H(W,V), and U is the mapping cylinder of a homeomorphism ∂P2  →  ∂P1.

(c) By using relative hyperbolization, it is proved in [\cite=djw] that if an aspherical manifold bounds a triangulable manifold, then it bounds an aspherical one. Can we omit the word "triangulable?" In other words, if an aspherical topological manifold M bounds, does it bound an aspherical manifold? If M does not support any triangulation, then it cannot bound a triangulated manifold, and one can no longer use relative hyperbolization directly. For the specific examples of nontriangulable aspherical manifolds given in this paper, a similar construction can be applied to produce aspherical manifolds that they bound. The general case remains open.
