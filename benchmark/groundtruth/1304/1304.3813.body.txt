Remark on the paper "On the eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian on compact Riemannian manifolds " by Q.-M. Cheng and L. Zeng

On April 11, 2013, a preprint was posted on arXiv by Q.-M. Cheng and L. Zeng [\cite=CZ], about eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian acting on functions. However, it is very well known that the Witten Laplacian

[formula]

on a compact measure metric space (M,g,e- f  dv) is unitarily equivalent to the Schrödinger operator [formula] on (M,g) and it has thus the same spectrum (see for instance [\cite=S]). Therefore, all the results of this above mentioned preprint are immediate consequences of that concerning the Schrödinger operator [formula] on (M,g) already obtained in the papers [\cite=EI] [\cite=EHI] [\cite=IM1] [\cite=IM2] [\cite=WX], provided replacing the potential q or V in that papers by [formula] (obviousely, this is in particular, the case for the self shrinkers).

Using the same observation of unitary equivalence above, we also note that a lot of published results concerning eigenvalues of the Laplace-Witten operator, can be deduced from that concerning Schrödinger operators.
