Melting of graphene clusters

Introduction

The study of the melting of crystals is one of the important subjects in the field of phase transitions. Melting phenomena occurs at the surface of bulk materials [\cite=Dash] and needs a microscopic theory for a deep understanding. Nano-scale molecular clusters due to their size-dependent properties show melting processes different from those of bulk materials and infinite size two-dimensional materials. The melting of nano-clusters has received considerable attention recently and it was found that nano-clusters melt typically below their corresponding bulk melting temperature [\cite=Koga] [\cite=Ercolessi] [\cite=Lewis]. This is due to the higher chemical reactivity of nano-clusters which is the consequence of the increased accessible surface and the presence of more free dangling bonds.

The microscopic behavior of nano-clusters at finite temperature can be understood theoretically using a variety of molecular dynamics (MD) methods [\cite=Cleveland] [\cite=Rytkonen] [\cite=Joshi] [\cite=Chuang] [\cite=Beck] [\cite=Bas] and can be determined directly by experiment [\cite=Schmidt] [\cite=Shvartsburg] [\cite=Breaux]. In most of the simulations the microscopic structure is characterized in terms of bond-lengths and their average fluctuations over many cycles of the MD simulation [\cite=Rey] [\cite=Rodeja] [\cite=Li].

Since the discovery of two dimensional materials, i.e. graphene [\cite=Castro] [\cite=Geim] and hexagonal boron nitride sheet [\cite=zettle2009] the melting of these new materials have attracted many researches [\cite=Zakhar]. The new 2D crystalline materials respond to an increasing temperature by loosing their lattice symmetry, e.g. Zakharchenko et al. [\cite=Zakhar] studied the high temperature behavior of graphene using atomistic simulations. The melting temperature of graphene was estimated to be about 4900 K. Before melting first Stone-Wales defects appear because of their smallest energy barrier. When increasing temperature further eventually spaghetti-type of carbon chains are formed that spread in 3D. A similar melting process can be found for carbon nanotubes using a much smaller critical Lindemann parameter[\cite=Kaiwang]. The melting temperature of perfect single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) was estimated to be around 4800 K [\cite=Kaiwang]. In graphene nano-ribbons different types of edges (i.e. zig-zag, armchair) affect the melting process differently, e.g. Lee et al. [\cite=Lee] found that at 2800 K edge reconstruction occurs in a zig-zag ribbon.

In our previous work we found that the minimum energy configuration for flat carbon clusters up to N=5 atoms consists of a line of carbons [\cite=kosi1] (linear chain) which is in agreement with ab-initio [\cite=raghavachari] calculations. Carbon planar rings were found for 5<  N<  19 and graphene nano-flakes are minimum energy configurations for larger N [\cite=kosi]. Here we investigate the effect of temperature on those minimum energy configurations and find the melting temperature of such small flat carbon clusters, as function of the size of the clusters.

A systematic study of the size dependence of the melting temperature is still lacking as well as the effect of H-passivation of the edge atoms on the melting process. We will present such a study and identify the different fundamental steps in the melting process. We found that graphene nano-flakes have a lower transition temperature as compared to bulk graphene and graphene nanoribbons. We also found that H-passivated clusters exhibit higher melting temperature than non H-passivated clusters. In all cases, once clusters are defected they can be in different meta-stable structures (none-planar isomers). We will compare our results with those found for graphene and graphene nano-ribbons. The Lindemann index increases with respect to temperature in all cases while its slope versus temperature increases (decreases) linearly for the ring structures (graphene nano-flakes). Furthermore, using ab-initio molecular dynamics simulation we analyse the energy change due to defect formation.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the atomistic model and the simulation method. Sec. III contains our main results and a discussion of the melting of graphene-like clusters and H-passivated clusters. Sec. IV gives information on the topology of the defects. The effect of defects on the total energy is introduced in Sec. V. In Sec. VI, we conclude the paper.

Simulation Method and Model

Minimum energy configurations

The second-generation of Brenner reactive empirical bond order (REBO) potential[\cite=bren2] function between carbon atoms is used in the present work. All the parameters for the Brenner potential can be found in Ref.[\cite=bren2] and are therefore not listed here.

In Fig. [\ref=figmodel] we depict the minimum energy configurations for carbon clusters which are carbon lines up to 5 atoms (Fig. [\ref=figmodel](a)), carbon rings for up to 18 atoms (Fig. [\ref=figmodel](b)), graphene nano-flakes up to 55 atoms (Fig. [\ref=figmodel](c)) and hydrogen passivated graphene nano-flakes (Fig. [\ref=figmodel](d)). These configurations were obtained using conjugate gradient minimization method in our previous works [\cite=kosi] [\cite=kosi1]. The carbon line structures are energetically favorable structures among other possible geometries (isomers) which are shown in Fig. 1 of Ref. [\cite=kosi1], i.e. two for C3, 6 for C4 and 11 for C5. Among all possible carbon nano-clusters (isomers) for 5<  N<  19 atoms the ground state are a single ring, see Fig. [\ref=figmodel](b). Increasing the number of carbon atoms, graphene nano-flakes are formed which can have pentagon and heptagon defects in addition to common hexagons, see Fig. [\ref=figmodel](c). Notice that by passivating the dangling bonds by hydrogens in graphene flakes some structural deformations are possible. In Fig. [\ref=figmodel](d) the minimum energy configurations for hydrogen passivated graphene nano-flakes (which were obtained by passivating the structures in Fig. [\ref=figmodel](c)) are shown. It is interesting to note that most of these minimum configuration structures have zig-zag edges which is due to the higher stability of these kind of edges as compared to arm-chair edges [\cite=Seifert].

In the present work we study the temperature effects on the structural transition and melting properties of these minimum energy configurations. Using molecular dynamic simulations, we obtain the new configuration of the above mentioned clusters at a given temperature T. This temperature is maintained during the whole simulation by the Langevin thermostat [\cite=rui]. The MD time step was taken to be 0.5 fs. Different properties of the cluster were measured during the MD simulation of 106 MD steps (500 ps) at fixed temperature.

Density-functional tight-binding molecular dynamics

In order to have an independent test of the results obtained from the bond order potential for the melting of graphene nano-flakes, we also performed independent calculations using the DFTB/MD (density-functional based tight-binding molecular dynamics) approach which is a QM/MD technique based on a tight binding method using an approximate density-functional formalism [\cite=Porezag] [\cite=Elstner] [\cite=Frauenheim]. DFTB passed several benchmark tests with first principle density functional theory (DFT) [\cite=Porezag] [\cite=Zheng] [\cite=Alberto] for carbon structures. Alberto et al. [\cite=Alberto] showed that DFTB accurately reproduced the structures and energies for a range of point defects such as vacancies and Stone-Wales defects in graphene. Migration barriers for vacancies and Stone-Wales defect formation barriers are also accurately reproduced. Kuc et al [\cite=Seifert] studied the stability of graphene nano-flakes using DFTB and by comparing their results with DFT, good agreement was found between the two methods. Although this method is two orders of magnitude faster than DFT but for the purpose of this work where we will study about 90 different configurations it will be computationally expensive. Therefore, we will use DFTB for a few N-values in order to show the accuracy of our classical MD simulation by considering one of the line carbons, two of the rings, five of graphene nano-flakes and six of H-passivated systems.

Lindemann criterion and specific heat

The root-mean-square relative bond length variance (Lindemann criterion) in addition to the caloric curve gives a reasonable computational method for determining the melting point of nano-clusters. It is sensitive to any change in the bond lengths at the microscopic scale. The Lindemann criterion [\cite=March] [\cite=Ziman] is often used in molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations in order to estimate the melting temperature in three dimensional bulk systems [\cite=Blome] [\cite=Shen], two dimensional materials [\cite=Zakhar] and nano-clusters [\cite=erik]. We used the distance-fluctuation of the Lindemann index (δ) in order to identify the melting temperature of our nano-clusters. For a system of N atoms, the local Lindemann index for the [formula] atom in the system is defined as [\cite=Zhou] [\cite=Ding]

[formula]

and the system-average Lindemann index is then given by

[formula]

where rij is the distance between the [formula] and [formula] atoms, N is the number of atoms and 〈  ·    ·    ·  〉T denotes the thermal average at temperature T. The Lindemann index  [\cite=Lindemann] depends on the specific system and its size which varies in the range 0.03-0.15, e.g.  it was recently [\cite=Zhou] applied to nanoparticles and homopolymers and found to be in the range of 0.03-0.05, for Ni nanoclusters it was found to be around 0.08 [\cite=erik] and for carbon nanotubes about 0.03 [\cite=Kaiwang].

For sufficiently low temperature there is no structural transition and the atoms exhibit thermal fluctuation around the T = 0 equilibrium position. The oscillation amplitude increases linearly with temperature due to Hooke's regime for the atomic vibrations leading to a linear increase of the Lindemann index with T. At higher temperature, the anharmonic vibrations (non-linear effects) become important and the Lindemann index exhibits a nonlinear dependence on T. The particle oscillation amplitude increases faster than linear with T, but the system does not melt yet, since the arrangement of atoms have still some ordered structure, i.e. solid-liquid coexistence state. For small nano-clusters the latter is related to not well defined small three dimensional structures. In general, melting occurs when the Lindemann index increases very sharply with T over a small T-range. In this study we will assume that the melting point is around the sharp jump in δ, i.e. when the system becomes almost a random coil. We will show that the Lindemann index adequately indicates the structural deformation (melting-like transition) of carbon nano-clusters. The obtained linear regime in δ is smoother than some of the previous studies [\cite=erik] for small nano-clusters. Therefore, we will not only use the critical value of δ to determine the melting point but we will also pay particular attention to the temperature dependence of the Lindemann index when identifying the melting temperature.

In addition to the Lindmann index, the total energy (caloric curve) and specific heat variation versus T are two common quantities which can be used to determine the phase transition. We calculated the specific heat CP using the equation[\cite=Hsu]

[formula]

where [formula]. The average potential energy of the system was calculated as a function of temperature. In the crystalline state the total energy of the system increases almost linearly with temperature, and then after the critical temperature is reached, it increases more steeply which is a signature of melting. We will show that for graphene nano-flake with 54 carbon atoms (C54 and C54H20) energy and heat capacity calculations are found to be consistent with the results for the melting temperature that we obtained from the analysis of the Lindemann index.

Results and Discussion

Energy

The temperature dependence of the total energy of graphene nano-flakes (C54 and C54H20) are depicted in Fig. [\ref=54_pot] using the Brenner potential. For C54 the energy increases linearly at low temperatures and starts to deviate from the linear behavior around T=2300 K due to the reconstruction of the zigzag edges and the formation of pentagon-heptagon (5-7) defects. It indicates that the first nucleation of melting starts around 2300 K and modifies the edges. As temperature increases, the formation of pentagon, heptagon, 5-7 defects or 5-8-5 are possible and eventually large ring structures results in a dramatic increase of the energy. Above T= 3400 K, there is a sharp increase in the energy showing a completely molten structure.

For C54H20, passivation removes the dangling orbitals of the C atoms at the edge, lowering the reactivity, and increasing the stability of the cluster. It was found that unlike previous case (without H-passivated clusters), the H-passivated clusters keep their initial atomic arrangement up to higher temperature and therefore no noticeable change in the geometry was found for temperatures up to T=3200 K for C54H20. The binding energy of the H-passivated clusters are larger than for non-passivated clusters. As temperature increases further to T=3500 K, some hydrogen atoms start to dissociate and finally the clusters convert into hydrocarbon chains around T=4000 K showing larger melting temperature than the corresponding non-passivated cluster which has a melting temperature of 3400 K (see Fig. [\ref=54_pot]).

Lindemann index

Fig. [\ref=54_delta] displays the variation of the Lindemann index with temperature for (a) C54 and (b) C54H20. The corresponding structures during heating for a few typical temperatures are shown in the insets. The slope of the function δ(T) (i.e. [formula]) is plotted in Fig. [\ref=alpha] for all studied structures of Fig. [\ref=figmodel]. The value of α (before reaching the melting point) increases monotonically for the carbon lines (Fig. [\ref=figmodel](a)) and carbon rings (Fig. [\ref=figmodel](b)). This is an indication of keeping the initial configuration while non-linear effects indicate defect formation, e.g. 5-7 defects in C54. The increase of α is fitted in Fig. [\ref=alpha] by the red line for N  ≤  18 which is given by the function α(N) = a + b  ×  N, where: a=1.005 ([formula] and b=0.070 (±  0.004)  ×  10- 5K- 1. Note that increasing temperature forces the system to be out-of-planed, e.g. the rings at finite temperature are not circles and become deformed ellipsoids in 3D.

For N ≥   19, there is a sudden decrease in α of size Δα = 1.11  ×  10- 5K- 1 due to the strong sp2 bonds within the graphene like clusters (instead of simple covalent bonds in the carbon lines and rings) and a decreasing number of dangling bonds. The average behavior is fitted by the red line α(N) = a + b  ×  N, where: a= 1.63([formula] and b=-0.012 ([formula]. For bowl like clusters (N=20, 28, 38, 44), due to the presence of topological defective pentagon inside the cluster, the α value is larger as compared to their neighbor clusters. Therefore the important message is that dangling bonds and any kind of defects enhance anharmonic effects.

In order to investigate the effect of large size samples we also calculated α for a few large graphene nano-flakes and found that α decreases with N (see inset in Fig. [\ref=alpha]). The maximum considered size of graphene nano-flakes had 4000 atoms. For large N, one expects saturation of α, thus a line with negative slope which we fitted for 19 ≤   N ≤   55 should not be applicable. Therefore, we used the fit α(N) = α(  ∞  ) + a / (1  +  b  ×  N), where: α(  ∞  ) = 0.134  ×  10- 5K- 1, a=1.213 ([formula] and b=48.7 (±  4.9)  ×  10- 4 on large clusters. These results clearly indicate that δ for small graphene nano-flakes is considerably larger than for larger flakes and graphene. Although the Lindemann index was defined initially in the thermodynamical limit (bulk material) we show that it is also a good parameter to investigate the effect of temperature and melting of nano size systems.

For completeness, we calculated α for H-passivated graphene nano-flakes for 11≤   N ≤   55 number of C-atoms and found that α, on average, decreases with N (see Fig. [\ref=alpha](b)). The average behavior is fitted by the red line α(N) = a / (1  +  b  ×  N), where: a=2.262 ([formula] and b=0.024 (±  0.003)  ×  10- 5. The rapid decrease in the latter fit (Fig. [\ref=alpha](b)) is an indication of the role of H-passivation in making the graphene nano-flakes more stable against temperature for larger N.

Specific heat

The calculated specific heat curve for C54 is shown in Fig [\ref=54_spe]. A clear peak is observed in the specific heat with a maximum around 3400 K which we identify as the melting temperature, and which is close to the results from the analysis using the Lindemann index. The specific heat curve is also shown for C54H20 (see red symbols in Fig. [\ref=54_spe]) and displays a peak around T=4000 K which is identified as the melting temperature, showing good agreement with the result of the previous caloric curve (see Fig. [\ref=54_pot]). A discontinuity or a sharp peak   in the heat capacity is a clear indication of a phase transition. However, here this is not exactly a solid-to-liquid like transition, but rather a nano-flake to random-coil transition.

Melting-temperature

The melting temperature for all studied clusters CN(2  ≤  N  ≤  55) is shown in Fig. [\ref=melting](a). The different parts separated by vertical dashed lines correspond to the three set of systems shown in Figs. [\ref=figmodel](a-c). For small linear structures except for the carbon dimer the melting temperature increases with the number of atoms (linear chains have bond breaking).

In order to check if for large N we approach the melting temperature of bulk graphene, we also calculated the melting temperature of three large graphene nano-flakes and graphene (by performing a simulation having 4000 atoms with periodic boundary condition with NPT ensemble) and presented the results in Table I. From Table I it is clear that large flakes approach slowly the melting temperature of graphene, i.e. 5500  K. As a comparison the melting temperature reported in Ref. [\cite=Zakhar] by using the LCBOPII potential was 4900 K and in Ref. [\cite=Brad] using REBO was 5200 K.

We fitted the melting temperature for graphene like clusters (red curve in Fig. [\ref=melting](a)) by the function Tm(N) = Tbulkm - (a / (b + N)) where [formula], [formula] and Tbulkm = 5500K for graphene was taken from our simulation. We included the results of Table I in this fit. We also calculated the melting temperature using DFTB for the clusters with N=5, 10, 18, 20, 28, 38, 45, and 54 (C54) which are represented by the open red circles in Fig. [\ref=melting](a). They are found to slightly overestimate the melting temperature but exhibit clearly the same N-dependent trend.

For completeness, we also calculated the melting temperature of H-passivated clusters for N=11-55 C-atoms (Fig. [\ref=melting](b)). The melting temperature fluctuates around T=3500 K (note that on average Tm increases slowly with N with large fluctuations imposed on it) for most of the clusters with minima for N=29 and N=31 C-atoms due to the large number of defects in their structures. The clusters which have pentagon defects on the boundary usually have lower melting temperature then the others. Here, the melting temperature for the clusters N=13, 21, 29, 42, 49 and 54 were also calculated using DFTB (open red circles in Fig. [\ref=melting](b)). In most cases the DFTB results are close to the Brenner potential results indicating that the Brenner bond order potential is a useful specialized potential for thermal effects in hydrocarbons.

Topology of Defects

In this section we consider the topology of some of the defects which are created during the melting process of C54 using DFTB calculations. We found that these defects have a pronounced effect on the melting behavior of the system whose mechanism is different from both graphene and graphene nanoribbons. At low temperature the probability of defect creation is small and the flakes remains perfect which for this low temperature range is similar to graphene [\cite=Zakhar] and graphene nanoribbon [\cite=Koskinen]. Increasing temperature (above about 2300 K) the energy increases and the system can overpass certain potential barriers and we found that during the molecular dynamics simulation the system transits from one metastable state to another, see Figs. [\ref=5-7](a-b). We show five snap shots of C54 at different temperature in Fig. [\ref=5-7]. The transition temperature at which the edge reconstruction occurs, i.e. T~   2400 K is lower than those found for defect formation in graphene, i.e. 3800 K and edge reconstruction in graphene nano-ribbons [\cite=Lee], i.e. 2800 K. As seen in Fig. [\ref=5-7](b) the first defected structure has one heptagon and one pentagon at the edge with different bond lengths. The energy difference between non-defected (Fig. [\ref=5-7](a)) and defected (Fig. [\ref=5-7](b)) one is about 0.28  eV/atom which is due to the 900  K difference in the temperature between these two structures. In Fig. [\ref=5-7] the next defected configuration due to a 1200 K increase in temperature is shown which has more heptagon and pentagon defects (colored parts). By increasing temperature further we found some transition in the defected parts and even an edge reconstruction from heptagon to hexagon and vise versa until the appearance of a tail-like part in the cluster, Fig. [\ref=5-7](e). The melting temperature for C54 as shown in Fig. [\ref=melting](a) (open circle symbol) is around 3900 K. This melting temperature is lower than those found for graphene. The larger the graphene nano-flake the higher the melting temperature. For small graphene nano-flakes the larger number of dangling bonds results in a lower melting temperature and larger boundary effects. The energy diagram for five snap shots is depicted in Fig. [\ref=5-7](f). The presented energy is the difference between the total energy of the system at given temperature and the zero temperature total energy for C54.

In Figs. [\ref=5-7h](a-d) we show the temperature effect on C54H20. In Fig. [\ref=5-7h](e) the corresponding energy diagram is shown. Hydrogens become released at T=3900 K. Notice that DFTB calculations for the shown configurations in Figs. [\ref=5-7h](a-d) were performed separately, i.e. we do not increase temperature of sample Fig. [\ref=5-7h](a) in order to obtain Fig. [\ref=5-7h](b), but instead we performed four different calculations for these four snap shots. Thus we do not expect that we have sequential configurations.

Conclusion

Using molecular dynamics simulation and the Lindemann index for melting supplemented with results for the total energy and the specific heat, we investigated the melting of carbon nano clusters. The melting temperature of small carbon flakes is lower than those for graphene and graphene nano-ribbons. The Lindemann index is sensitive to temperature and is a good quantity for determining when structural deformations of the clusters start to occur. The melting temperature of small flakes on average increases versus the number of atoms in carbon nano clusters. All clusters investigated show premelting behavior with different premelting intervals. For certain N-values defects are already present inside the cluster which lowers the melting temperature. H-passivated clusters have a higher melting temperature than the non H-passivated clusters with the same number of C-atoms. The melting temperature for H-passivated clusters is larger than for non-passivated clusters. Our simulation results also help to understand the formation of defects (due to the increase of temperature) in the graphene nano-flake which can then be applied to understand the growth and thermal treatment of nanographene. We supplemented our analysis by DFTB calculations which confirm the N-dependence of the melting temperature.
