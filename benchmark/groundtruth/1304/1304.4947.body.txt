On the size and location of the X-ray emitting coronae around black holes

Introduction

Observations of accreting black holes (BHs) often indicate the presence of hard X-rays having energies much greater than the expected thermal peak of the accretion disk. This is true not only for Active Galactic Nuclei [\citep=Elvis1978] but also for X-ray binaries [\citep=White1982coronae].

It has been widely postulated that hard X-rays are the product of inverse Compton scattering of seed photons from accretion disks by hot "coronae" [\citep=HaardtMaraschi91], however despite our observational [\citep=Zdziarski1999] and theoretical [\citep=Schnittman2012states] efforts, there are still a number of fundamental questions regarding the geometry, or composition of accretion-disk coronae.

At low luminosities ([formula], where LEdd is the Eddington luminosity), the hard-X-rays are thought to originate from a hot, quasi-spherical and large ([formula]) advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) which replaces the innermost disk around the BH [\citep=NarayanYi1994]. On the other hand, at luminosities [formula], observations of XRBs and Seyfert AGNs show the clear presence of a more compact X-ray emitting source (the corona; e.g. [\citealt=McHardy2006]) on top of a geometrically-thin, optically thick accretion disk extending as far in as the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO).

Amongst the clearest evidence for the co-existence of the corona with the disk is the presence of Fe K-shell emission lines together with other reflection features in the X-ray spectra of these sources [\citep=miller07review]. From the profile of these emission lines we are able to obtain information on the effects of strong Doppler and gravitational redshifts natural to the space-time around BHs and measure their spin [\citep=miller07review].

Having a tool to probe the innermost regions around BHs and to measure their spin (a = cJ / GM2, - 1 < a  <  1) is of particular importance as the distribution of spin in nearby supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be used to distinguish between various BH growth scenarios [\citep=BertiVolonteri2008], and in the case of stellar mass BHs, their spin distribution relates to the distribution of angular momentum of the progenitors (e.g. [\citealt=millersn11]). Knowledge of spin is also essential if one wishes to test if relativistic jets can be powered by the spin energy of BHs via the Blandford-Znajek process [\citep=NarayanMcClintock2012] or, in the near future, if there is evidence for violations of the No-Hair Theorem [\citep=Johannsen2011nohair].

The location and compactness of the corona - which is irradiating the disk and giving rise to the reflection features - are thus of paramount importance in the study of strong gravity. Nonetheless, in theoretical consideration of the corona it is often assumed to be compact and located in the inner regions, [formula] around the BH [\citep=Miniu04]. This assumption has consistently been successful in describing the spectral and timing properties of BHs at the highest signal-to-noise available, however strong deviation from this could affect our ability to probe strong gravity around BHs [\citep=Dauser2013].

Furthermore, coronae are known to play an important role in state transitions in XRBs [\citep=reis20121650]; and jets in both XRBs and AGNs have often been strongly linked with the corona [\citep=fundamentalplane]. If the corona is the base of such a jet [\citep=FalckeBiermann1999], then the amount and the form in which energy escapes through the jet is largely dependent on the enigmatic properties of the corona, highlighting the importance in establishing the size and location of these regions.

In this letter, we explore the results aimed at measuring the physical sizes and locations of coronae around luminous accreting SMBHs ([formula] typical of bright nearby Seyferts and quasars). We find that in all cases the coronae are located significantly closer than [formula] from the accretion disks and their sizes are suggestive of being highly compact. These results give credence to the assumptions often employed in most reflection-based studies of BHBs and AGNs.

Location based on reverberation lags

With the discovery of a soft X-ray reverberation lag of [formula]s in the AGN 1H 0707-495 [\citep=FabZog09], a new method to measure the distance (Dcor) between the X-ray emitting region and the accretion disks was established. The decomposition of the spectrum of 1H 0707-  495 into direct and reflected emission components supported interpreting the observed lag as a signature of the light travel time between the corona (the hard X-ray continuum source) and the accretion disk (which reprocess the flux into a reflection component with atomic spectral features).

Despite the success that this "reflection" model had in explaining the timing and spectral features of 1H 0707-495 [\citep=FabZog09], a further interpretation was soon made available where the lag was due to the reverberation caused by scattering of X-rays passing through an absorbing medium that happen to lie in the line of sight to the central AGN [\citep=MillerTurner2010lag]. However, the subsequent discovery of similar lags in a large number of sources (see below), spanning a large range of masses, Eddington fractions, and inclination angles, is likely incompatible with the specialized partial covering geometry required to explain the lags. Thus, the original light-crossing argument remains the best interpretation for these soft lags. For a detailed description of soft X-ray reverberation techniques and its applications see [\citet=Zoghbi2012lag] [\citet=WilkinsFabian2013].

At the time of writing, there were a total of 17 radio-quiet Seyferts with measured soft lags that met our luminosity criteria. This sample is shown in Table 1 together with estimates for the mass and luminosity as a fraction of Eddington to each source collected from the literature. The lags compiled here are taken from the work of [\citet=DeMarcolags] [\citet=Zoghbi2012lag] [\citet=Fabian2012iras13224] [\citet=Cackett2012ESOlag] and [\citet=Kara2013iras], whereas the masses are primarily from [\citet=zhouzhangmasses2010] [\citet=Zhoumasses2005] [\citet=Bentzngc41512006] and [\citet=Onkenngc41512007]. As Seyferts are known to be highly variable, the luminosities shown here are meant to be seen only as a rough indication of the average luminosity of each system.

Due to the scale-invariant nature of the physics governing accretion flows onto BHs, the lag time scale t depend primarily on the mass of the central BH: t  ~  GM / c3  =  rg / c. We estimate the probability distribution for the distances between the coronae and accretion disks by drawing samples from the probability distribution of the lag times and masses as obtained from the literature and reported in Table 1. For NGC 4051, MRK 766, RE'J1034+396, NGC 7469, Mrk 335, PG 1211+143, NGC 3516, NGC 5548 and NGC 4151, their masses were assumed to have a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation given by the average of the positive and negative errors shown in Table 1, when the reported errors were asymmetric. For the remaining sources with the exception of ESO-113-G010, the logarithm of the masses were assumed to have a Gaussian distribution with the symmetric errors reported in each reference. Finally, for ESO-113-G010, we assumed a uniform distribution in the range given in Table 1.

An example of a derived probability distribution based on 106 samples is shown in Fig. 1 (left) for NGC 4051. We report on the 5th column of Table 1 the median of Dcor with the 1Ïƒ error taken to be the standard deviation of each source sample. Figure 1 (right) shows the distribution for the combined sample, where it becomes clear that there is a peaks at [formula] and a further, minor peak at [formula] with a tail that extends up to [formula].

The 3 sources giving rise to the second peak at larger Dcor are NGC 4151, RE J1034+396 and ESO 113-G010. There is currently uncertainty on the mass of the SMBH in NGC 4151. The mass determined from reverberation mapping is 4.57[formula] [\citep=Bentzngc41512006]. A stellar dynamical mass measurement obtained using ground based I-band long-slit spectra and the Schwarzschild orbit superposition code of [\citet=vallurietal04] gave only an upper limit of [formula] [\citep=Onkenngc41512007]. However, a recent result based on high resolution near infrared integral field spectroscopic observations of the CO-band head with the Gemini North NIFS spectrograph, gives a revised stellar dynamical mass of [formula] (M. Valluri; private communication) - nearly a factor of 2 greater than previous estimates. If this turns out to be right, Dcor for this source presented in Fig 2 should be closer to 5[formula].

As for the other two sources peaking at [formula], it is possible that they were indeed caught at a time when their coronae were further than the median. It is interesting that RE J1034+396 is the only persistent AGN to ever show a quasi-periodic oscillation [\citep=rej1034qpo]. In the stellar-mass BH , it has recently been shown that the onset of the more coherent QPOs are associated with the collapse of a corona from [formula]  during the transition from the hard-intermediate to the soft-intermediate state [\citep=reis20121650].

Size based on microlensing

The possibility of using the "lens-like" effect of stars on distant object is not new. However, its practical use in directly probing the inner regions around SMBHs was not established until the discovery of a flux-ratio anomaly in optical macroimages of the gravitationally lensed quasar QSO 2237+0305 where the optical flux ratio between the brightest macroimages was statistically inconsistent with unity [\citep=Irwin1989]. Although originally microlensing was not the only explanation for the flux anomaly problem in the optical [\citep=DalalKochanek2002], the systematic detection of an increase in the anomaly magnitude at higher energies strongly favoured microlensing as the cause of these anomalies [\citep=PooleyBlackburne2007]. As the effect of microlensing increases as the size scale of the lensed region decreases - as long as the source is smaller than the projection of the Einstein radius of the microlens into the plane (for a detailed review of microlensing techniques see [\citealt=Wambsganss2006]) - this discovery confirmed the expected hierarchy in the characteristic sizes of the optical, UV and X-ray emission regions, with the latter often thought to be the most compact.

Microlensing studies at optical/IR have often arrived at accretion disk sizes in the order of [formula] [\citep=BlackburnePooley2006], and most remarkably, such studies have shown that this radius scales with BH mass in a manner consistent with the expectations of thin-disk theory [\citep=MorganKochanek2010]. We are now at a stage where the size of the X-ray emitting corona in the innermost regions around these BHs are beginning to be measured [\citep=sizepg1115] [\citep=size1104] [\citep=Mosquera2013]. We list in Table 1 (Bottom) the details of the 6 sources with a quantitatively derived half-light radius for the X-ray emitting region. These values were compiled from the various work listed above and especially from Fig. 8 of [\citet=Mosquera2013]. As these are all SMBHs, the accretion disk emission peaks in optical/UV, so the size of the X-ray emitting region therefore directly relates with the corona. In compiling the various masses presented in Table 2, we have searched the literature for the latest BH mass estimates based on the Mg[formula] mass-line width relation for all sources but HE 1104-1805, where C[formula] was used instead. The values quoted are from the work of [\citet=Peng2006amass] and [\citet=Sluse2012mass].

In a similar manner to Â§ 2, we have estimated a probability distribution for the size of the X-ray emitting region of each source in units of [formula] based on 106 randomly sampled values of mass and size (in cm) assuming either a Gaussian distribution with symmetric errors in logarithmic scale or, in the cases where such are not present, a uniform distribution over the range given in Table 1. Figure 3 summarises the result for the characteristic sizes of the coronae.

Discussion

The two techniques explored in this work effectively probe different aspects of the same emission region. From the reverberation lags, we show in Fig 2 that 14/17 sources in our sample are at distances strongly clustered around 2-3[formula] above the accretion disk. Taken at face value and assuming that the corona is radially symmetric about the central BH, this immediately suggest that a large fraction of Seyferts should be rapidly spinning (as a point of reference, a radius [formula] corresponds to a spin parameter a = 0.75cJ / GM2), as is often found with detailed spectral analyses [\citep=Waltonreisspin2013]. For a few sources, notably Mrk 841 and NGC 6860, the coronae appear to be at distances commensurate with radii for which there are no stable orbits, even for a maximally rotating BH. However, the effect of lag dilution could artificially reduce the intrinsic lag [\citep=WilkinsFabian2013] thus increasing the distance between the disk and corona; and possible errors in the BH mass could also change the absolute Dcor reported here.

A number of other systematics uncertainties in the derivation of soft-lags, including the unknown geometry of the corona or intrinsic flux variation [\cite=Zoghbi2012lag] [\cite=Kara2013iras] could also increase the radius by a factor of a few. Indeed, for the case of NGC 4151, [\citet=Zoghbi2012lag] showed that the lag-time differed by a factor of [formula] between high and low flux states. The result presented here conservatively shows the upper value (~  2000 s), as found in the low-state of the source. If instead, we use the [formula] s lag, the distance between the disk and the corona would commensurate with a single gravitational radii. It is clear that for the majority of the Seyferts reported here, the distance between the X-ray emitting region and the inner accretion disk is smaller than [formula] even if we allow for an order of magnitude systematic shift in the derived values. The microlensing results further suggest that these coronae are highly compact, with upper limits on their characteristic sizes in the order of 20-30[formula].

The objects explored here span a large range in mass and Eddington fraction; however, in all cases our selection criteria ([formula]) was such that the systems are thought to be in states where the accretion disk extends down to the ISCO [\citep=reis20121650];. Based on the presence of highly compact coronae, we postulate that the Seyferts and quasars presented here are in spectral states analogous to the hard/intermediate and the soft/intermediate states of stellar mass BHBs.

The compactness of the coronae in these sources strongly constrains models of Comptonisation, with magnetic reconnection/flares [\citep=MerloniFabian2001] or failed jet models [\citep=Ghisellini04jets] strongly favoured over models which predict larger, extended coronae [\citep=HaardtMaraschi91]. The small distance between the corona and the accretion disk further suggests that models where the energy is dissipated in the innermost regions or possibly even within the plunging regions, are favoured. Such a scenario was presented by [\citet=Hirose04], where the corona is described as a region of smooth magnetic field lines increasing in strength toward small radii and being strongest for maximally rotating BHs. More recently, global MHD simulations were used to show that the vast majority of the coronal emission comes from a relatively small volume of space [\citep=Schnittman2012states], consistent with observational results presented in this work.

We also note that the base of the jet in M87 has recently been spatially resolved to be [formula] in size [\citep=Doeleman2012Sci]. If this is associated with the coronae - as is the case in some models [\citep=FalckeBiermann1999] - then this too argues for a highly compact corona.

A number of arguments have so far eluded discussion and shall be mentioned here only briefly. First, the spectral fits to broad, relativistic lines profiles often require emissivities that are indicative of a very compact corona. This has been seen in both stellar-mass as well as SMBH and is often interpreted as the gravitational bending of light toward the inner regions of the disk [\citep=Miniu04]. We have chosen not to use this line of evidence as argument for a compact corona as it has recently been shown that these results could potentially be dependent on the prior assumption that the corona is inherently compact [\citep=Dauser2013].

The presence of compact coronae are also often inferred by the existence of high frequency QPOs whose frequencies are similar to that expected from the Keplerian frequencies in the inner few gravitational radii from the black hole. QPOs are known to be stronger at higher energies which has prompted the association of the corona as the main instrument in modulating the signals. Indeed, as mentioned above, QPOs have been seen in RE J1034+396 and in the tidal disruption source Swift J164449.3+573451 [\citep=Reis2012qpo], and in both cases the QPOs have been associated with the coronae as the emission from the disk peaks in the optical/UV. However, the drawback in inferring the properties of the corona from the QPO, is that to date there is no self-consistent model that can fully explain the observed behaviour in a wide variety of sources.

In summary, current evidence - based on both imaging and timing techniques - strongly favours a compact corona located a few gravitational radii above the accretion disk. Whether the corona follows a slab, spherical, conical or patchy geometry, or whether it contains a purely thermal, non-thermal or hybrid population of electrons is still unknown. However, future emission models should ensure that the majority of the energy dissipation occurs in a compact region close to the central black hole, if they are to be physical. Of course, both X-ray macrolensing and soft-lag techniques are still in their early days, and the application of these techniques in determining the size and location of coronal regions should be checked against a much larger sample in the near future.
