Fractional Discrete Systems with Sequential h-differences

Introduction

The first definition of the fractional derivative was introduced by Liouville and Riemann at the end of the 19-th century. Later on, in the late 1960s, this idea was used by engineers for modeling various processes. Thus the fractional calculus started to be exploited since that time. This calculus is a field of mathematics that grows out of the traditional definitions of calculus integral and derivative operators and deals with fractional derivatives and integrals of any order. Fractional difference calculus have been investigated by many authors, for example, [\cite=BalAbd] [\cite=AticiEloe] [\cite=atici1] [\cite=ChenLou] [\cite=Holm] [\cite=GirMoz] [\cite=Kaczorek2008] [\cite=MilRos] [\cite=DM_EP12] [\cite=ORT] [\cite=Pod] and others. The subject of positivity is well developed for fractional linear systems with continuous time, see [\cite=Kaczorek1] [\cite=Kaczorek2008] [\cite=Kaczorek2009]. However, positivity of fractional discrete systems with sequential h-differences is still a field to be examined. In the present paper we open our studies in this field. We give formulas for the unique solutions to systems in linear and semi-linear cases. Moreover, the positivity of systems is considered. The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=sec:2] all preliminaries definitions, facts and notations are gathered. Section [\ref=sec:3] presents systems with sequential fractional differences with results on uniqueness of solutions. Semilinear systems we included in Section [\ref=sec4]. The last Section concerns positivity of considered systems.

Preliminaries

Let us denote by FD the set of real valued functions defined on D. Let h > 0,α > 0 and put [formula] for h > 0 and [formula]. Let Due to notations from the time scale theory the operator [formula] is defined by σ(t): = t + h. The next definitions of h-difference operator was originally given in [\cite=BasFerTor], but here we propose simpler notation.

For a function [formula] the forward h-difference operator is defined as while the h-difference sum is given by where t = a + (n + 1)h, [formula] and [formula].

[\cite=BasFerTor] For arbitrary [formula] the h-factorial function is defined by

[formula]

where Γ is the Euler gamma function, [formula], and we use the convention that division at a pole yields zero.

Notice that if we use the general binomial coefficient [formula], then [\eqref=def:h-factorial_function] can be rewritten as

[formula]

The next definition with another notations was stated in [\cite=BasFerTor]. Here we use more suitable summations.

For a function [formula] the fractional h-sum of order α > 0 is given by where t = a + (α + n)h, [formula]. Moreover we define [formula].

Note that [formula].

Accordingly to the definition of h-factorial function the formula given in Definition [\ref=sum] can be rewritten as:

[formula]

for t = a + (α + n)h, [formula].

In [\cite=Holm] one can find the following form of the fractional h-sum of order α > 0: that can be useful in implementation.

The following definition one can find in [\cite=Abd] for h = 1.

Let α∈(0,1]. The Caputo h-difference operator aΔαh, *x of order α for a function [formula] is defined by

Note that: [formula], where α∈(0,1].

We need the power rule formulas in the sequel. Firstly, we easily notice that for p  ≠  0 the well defined h-factorial functions have the following property: More properties of h-factorial functions can be found in [\cite=GirMozCoimbra]. In our consideration the crucial role plays the power rule formula presented in [\cite=FerTor], i.e.

[formula]

where ψ(r) = (r - a + μh)(μ)h, [formula], [formula]. Note that using the general binomial coefficient one can write [\eqref=power:rule:FerTor] as

[formula]

Then if [formula], then we have for μ = 0, a = (1 - α)h and t = nh + a + αh

Let us define special functions, that we use in the next section to write the formula for solutions.

For α,β > 0 we define

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] and μ = kα + sβ.

It is worthy to notice that:

φ0,0(nh) = 1;

[formula];

[formula] and as the division by pole gives zero, the formula works also for [formula];

[formula].

We also need the property presented in the following proposition.

Let α,β∈(0,1],h > 0 and a = (α - 1)h,b = (β - 1)h. Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

We show only equality ([\ref=powerrule]), as [\eqref=powerrule_f] is a symmetric one. Let μ: = kα + sβ. For [formula] we define the following h-factorial function ψ(r): = (r + μh)(μ)h. Since

[formula]

for n  ≥  k and φk,s(mh) = 0 for m < k, by [\eqref=power:rule:FerTor] we get

[formula]

where t = a - kh + nh. Hence

[formula]

and

[formula]

From the application of the power rule follows the rule for composing two fractional h-sums. The proof for the case h = 1 one can find in [\cite=Holm]. For any positive h > 0 we presented the prove in [\cite=GirMozCoimbra].

Let x be a real valued function defined on [formula], where [formula]. For α,β > 0 the following equalities hold: where [formula].

The next proposition gives a useful identity of transforming Caputo fractional difference equations into fractional summations for the case when an order is from the interval (0,1].

[\cite=GirMozCoimbra] Let α∈(0,1], h > 0, a = (α - 1)h and x be a real valued function defined on [formula]. The following formula holds

Systems with sequential fractional differences

Let α,β∈(0,1] and [formula]. Moreover, let us take a = (α - 1)h and b = (β - 1)h. Then we define Note that [formula]. Then we apply the next difference operator of order β on the new function y and consider here an initial value problem stated by the system: with initial values: where xa,x0 are constant vectors from [formula]. We use Proposition [\ref=lemat12] twice and, for [formula], we get: and Hence

[formula]

where (nh): = f(nh,x(nh + a)). Nextly

[formula]

where [formula].

Firstly we prove the formula for the unique solution in linear case, i.e. when in equation ([\ref=uklad:ogolny]): f(nh,x(nh + a)) = Ax(nh + a), where A is a constant square matrix of degree n.

The solution to the system with initial conditions [\eqref=warunki], i.e. [formula] and x(a) = xa, [formula], is given by the following:

[formula]

for [formula].

For n = 0 let us notice, that only φ0,0(0) = 1, for any k > 0 the next terms are zero, so in fact we have: x(0h + a) = xa.

For n > 0 let us define the following sequence where [formula] and m(nh) = Axm(nh + a) with x0(nh + a) = xa.

We calculate the first step. As 0(nh) = Ax0(nh + a) = Axa, then [formula]. Going further,

[formula]

What could be written as

[formula]

and, using Proposition [\ref=fi], we get and the next element of the considered sequence has the following form: Taking m tending to +    ∞   we get formula [\eqref=formula:LinearSystem] as the solution of [\eqref=uklad_lin] with initial conditions [\eqref=warunki].

Semilinear sequential systems

Firstly we state some technical lemma and notations.

Let [formula] and α > 0. Let [formula] and [formula] for [formula]. Then for [formula] we get

[formula]

where t = nh  +  αh.

First let us consider the case k = 1. Then from Proposition [\ref=sumy] we can write

[formula]

where t = nh + 2αh, [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

The equation ([\ref=eq1]) for k > 1 follows inductively.

Note that Similarly to the procedure presented in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemat3] we can prove that for [formula] and α > 0,β > 0:

[formula]

Taking μ = kα + sβ and using formula [\eqref=fi_def2] we can write [\eqref=odwl] shortly in the following way

[formula]

Moreover, we can also write direct formula for values [formula] given in [\eqref=wartosc_x(nh+a)] for nonlinear problem. In fact using Definition [\ref=sum] of fractional summation, formula ([\ref=fi_def2]) of functions [formula] and Proposition [\ref=sumy] we write [\eqref=formula:function:nonlinear:part] as follows: Using the power rule formula for μ = 0 and by Remark [\ref=rem] we can write the recursive formula for the solution to nonlinear problem given by equations ([\ref=uklad:ogolny]) and conditions ([\ref=warunki]):

[formula]

The given formula ([\ref=rec]) also works for n = 0 as [formula]. Then x(0h + a) = xa. We can also check for example the next step: For special semilinear case when f(nh,x(nh + a)) = Ax(nh + a) + γ(nh) we have f(0,x(a)) = Ax(a) + γ(0). Then

The solution to the system with initial conditions [\eqref=warunki], i.e. [formula] and x(a) = xa, [formula] is given by

[formula]

for [formula].

For n = 0 let us notice, that only φ0,0(0) = 1, for any k > 0 the next terms are zero, so in fact we have: x(0h + a) = xa.

For n > 0 based on the proof for linear case we can write the solution formula as follows: Then taking into account the formulas ([\ref=odwl]) and [\eqref=formula:function:nonlinear:part] we get the form ([\ref=form]) as the solution of [\eqref=uklad_lin2] with initial conditions [\eqref=warunki].

Positivity

Based on [\cite=Kaczorek2008] [\cite=Kaczorek2009] we consider the following definitions.

The fractional system [\eqref=uklad:ogolny] is called positive fractional system if and only if [formula] for any initial conditions [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula]. The operator Tx0,xa:Xn  →  Xn is defined as where X∈Xn, X(n) = x(nh + a) and functions [formula] are given by [\eqref=fi_def1] and [\eqref=fi_def2], respectively.

The proof of the following proposition is analogous to similar fact in [\cite=Kaczorek2008].

Let [formula] and the right hand side of system [\eqref=uklad:ogolny], f fulfils [formula]. Then [formula].

The fractional system [\eqref=uklad:ogolny] is called locally positive fractional system if and only if for any initial conditions [formula] there is [formula] such that [formula] for n∈[0,τ].

If the matrix I + Ahα  +  β is positive and [formula] for [formula], then for any [formula] the fractional system [\eqref=uklad_lin2] is locally positive.

Since [formula], then with our assumptions, we get local positivity.
