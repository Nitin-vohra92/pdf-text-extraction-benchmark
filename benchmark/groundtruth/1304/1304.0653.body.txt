Ulrich Bundles on Quartic Surfaces with Picard Number 1

Introduction

The classification of Ulrich bundles on projective varieties has been of interest recently. Casanellas and Hartshorne classified stable Ulrich bundles by their first Chern class over a cubic surface in [\cite=CH12]. They give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of stable Ulrich bundles on a cubic surface in terms of the rank and the first Chern class. In [\cite=CKM12-K3], Coskun, Kulkarni and Mustopa proved the existence of simple Ulrich bundles of rank 2 with c1 = 3H on every smooth quartic surface in projective 3-space. In this note, we prove the existence of a stable Ulrich bundle of every even rank on a smooth quartic surface [formula] with Picard number 1. By simple degree considerations, no Ulrich bundle of odd rank can exist on X.

We use Casanellas and Hartshorne's method, used in [\cite=CH12]. First, we prove the existence of simple Ulrich bundles of a given even rank. We will then compute the dimension of the modular family of simple Ulrich bundles with this rank. We will finally prove that the strictly semistable Ulrich bundles are parametrized by a space of strictly smaller dimension. This will then prove the existence of stable Ulrich bundles.

Conventions

We work over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0.

[formula] denotes a smooth quartic surface with Picard number 1.

All sheaves, and all cohomology groups, are over X.

Let E be a vector bundle. We denote [formula] by E(t) for [formula].

Stability and semistability are defined in the sense of Gieseker.

We denote the various cohomology groups in capital letters, e.g. 1(E) and 1(E,F); and their dimensions in lowercase letters, e.g. 1(E) and 1(E,F).

Generalities

X is a K3 surface, hence its canonical bundle KX is trivial. Recall that the Picard group of X is free abelian of rank 1, generated by the hyperplane class H.

We start with the definition of an Ulrich bundle.

A vector bundle E of rank r is called an Ulrich bundle if for a linear projection [formula] we have [formula].

This condition is often impractical to use. Therefore, we will give an equivalent condition for a vector bundle E to be Ulrich. We first give a definition.

A vector bundle E is called arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay (ACM) if for every [formula] we have H1(E(t)) = 0.

A vector bundle E of rank r is Ulrich if and only if E is ACM and its Hilbert polynomial is P(t) = 2r(t + 2)(t + 1).

See [\cite=CKM12-ternary].

This proposition shows that the definition of an Ulrich bundle is independent of the linear projection [formula].

The following proposition gives the stability properties of Ulrich bundles.

An Ulrich bundle E is semistable. If E is strictly semistable, then it is destabilized by an Ulrich subbundle. For an Ulrich bundle, stability and μ-stability are equivalent.

See [\cite=CKM12-K3]. The last statement follows from [\cite=CH12].

In the short exact sequence 0  →  E  →  F  →  G  →  0 of coherent sheaves, if any two of E, F and G are Ulrich bundles, then so is the third.

See [\cite=CKM12-ternary].

The above two propositions imply the following result. Any strictly semistable Ulrich bundle is obtained from lower rank stable Ulrich bundles by consecutive extensions. We will use this fact in the proof of the theorem.

We end this section by some numerical results.

The degree of an Ulrich bundle of rank r is 6r.

This follows from [\cite=CKM13-delPezzo].

The slope of a vector bundle is defined to be the degree divided by the rank. Hence, the slope of an Ulrich bundle is 6.

On X, there exist no Ulrich bundles of odd rank. Therefore, any rank 2 Ulrich bundle on X is stable.

Indeed, the hyperplane class H has degree 4. The first assertion follows from the fact that no odd multiple of 6 can be divisible by 4. The second assertion follows since any rank 2 Ulrich bundle which is not stable would have to contain an Ulrich subbundle of rank 1 by Proposition [\ref=prop-destabilize].

The following result will be crucial in computing dimensions of various parameter spaces.

Let E and F be Ulrich bundles of ranks r and s respectively, and with first Chern classes C and D respectively. Then

[formula]

See [\cite=CH12].

The Proof of the Main Result

There exist stable Ulrich bundles on X of every even rank 2k.

Note that by Proposition [\ref=prop-degree], for an Ulrich bundle of rank 2k, the only possibility for the first Chern class is 3kH.

We use the method of Casanellas-Hartshorne as used in [\cite=CH12]. We proceed by induction on k. The case k = 1 follows from [\cite=CKM12-K3] and Corollary [\ref=cor-no_odd_rank].

Suppose that the theorem is proved for all ranks smaller than 2k. Choose a stable Ulrich bundle F1 of rank 2k - 2 and another stable Ulrich bundle F2 of rank 2, such that [formula] if k = 2. (We note that this is possible since the moduli space of stable rank-2 Ulrich bundles is 14-dimensional by [\cite=CKM12-K3].) By Equation ([\ref=eqn-1]), 1(F1,F2) = 12(k - 1)  >  0 and we can choose a non-split extension of F1 by F2. Therefore, by [\cite=CH12], this extension is simple; and by Proposition [\ref=prop-23], it is Ulrich. Hence there exist simple Ulrich bundles of rank 2k with first Chern class 3kH.

We now compute the dimension of the modular family of simple Ulrich bundles of rank 2k. We recall that this dimension is equal to [formula] for a simple Ulrich bundle E of rank 2k. We have [formula] and [formula] by Serre duality. Hence by Equation ([\ref=eqn-1]), we get

[formula]

The next step is to consider consecutive extensions of stable Ulrich bundles. Consider stable Ulrich bundles [formula] with ranks [formula], such that [formula] if i  ≠  j. For each Ei, the associated moduli space has dimension 12k2i + 2 by the calculation above; and hence the dimension of the moduli space parametrizing the choices of [formula] is [formula]. We consider strictly semistable Ulrich bundles E of rank 2k constructed from ai copies of Ei, [formula], by subsequent extensions. Then we have [formula]. Write [formula] for the total number of bundles used. We also write [formula] for the sequence of the kis, where each ki is taken ai times. We denote this collection of stable Ulrich bundles by C.

By Equation ([\ref=eqn-1]), for any two Ulrich bundles F and G of ranks 2f and 2g, we get

[formula]

Now consider a collection of a copies of Ei for some fixed 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, and b copies of Ej for some fixed 1  ≤  j  ≤  n, with i  ≠  j and a  +  b  ≥  2. We can form an Ulrich bundle F by extending a member of this collection with another member, and by extending the result with another member of the collection, and so on. In other words, we can construct a strictly semistable Ulrich bundle F whose Jordan-Hölder factors (which are stable) are precisely this collection of a copies of Ei and b copies of Ej. We then have [formula] and [formula], and by Serre duality [formula] and [formula]. Using these bounds we obtain that, for Ulrich bundles E obtained from subsequent extensions of all the Eis in the collection C, the moduli space parametrizing them has dimension at most

[formula]

Let us explain the count above. The terms 12k2i + 2 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n are given by the moduli count for the Ei. The other terms arise after considering the fact that the isomorphism classes of extensions of a vector bundle E by F are parametrized by [formula]. The dimension 1(F,G) for Ulrich bundles F and G of ranks 2f and 2g was computed above. Subtracting 1 and taking the sum, we obtain the last three terms in the above dimension count.

After writing [formula] and expanding k2, it can be shown that the moduli count above is smaller than 12k2 + 2, which is equal to the dimension of the moduli space of simple Ulrich bundles of rank 2k. Hence, there must exist a simple Ulrich bundle of rank 2k which is not strictly semistable. It follows that this Ulrich bundle is stable of rank 2k.
