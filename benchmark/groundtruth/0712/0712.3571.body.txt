Mapping photonic entanglement into and out of a quantum memory

Recent developments of quantum information science [\cite=zoller05] critically rely on entanglement, an intriguing aspect of quantum mechanics where parts of a composite system can exhibit correlations stronger than any classical counterpart [\cite=clauser78]. In particular, scalable quantum networks require capabilities to create, store, and distribute entanglement among distant matter nodes via photonic channels [\cite=briegel00]. Atomic ensembles can play the role of such nodes [\cite=duan01]. So far, in the photon counting regime, heralded entanglement between atomic ensembles has been successfully demonstrated via probabilistic protocols [\cite=chou05] [\cite=chou07]. However, an inherent drawback of this approach is the compromise between the amount of entanglement and its preparation probability, leading intrinsically to low count rate for high entanglement. Here we report a protocol where entanglement between two atomic ensembles is created by coherent mapping of an entangled state of light. By splitting a single-photon [\cite=tan91] [\cite=hessmo04] [\cite=Jacques07] and subsequent state transfer, we separate the generation of entanglement and its storage [\cite=Sangouard07]. After a programmable delay, the stored entanglement is mapped back into photonic modes with overall efficiency of 17%. Improvements of single-photon sources [\cite=Lounis05] together with our protocol will enable on-demand entanglement of atomic ensembles, a powerful resource for quantum networking.

In the quest to achieve quantum networks over long distances [\cite=briegel00], an area of considerable activity has been the interaction of light with atomic ensembles comprised of a large collection of identical atoms [\cite=duan01] [\cite=review3] [\cite=giacobino]. In the regime of continuous variables, a particularly notable advance has been the teleportation of quantum states between light and matter [\cite=polzik]. For discrete variables with photons taken one by one, important achievements include the efficient mapping of collective atomic excitations to single photons [\cite=laurat06] [\cite=felinto06] [\cite=thompson06] [\cite=Kuzmich06] [\cite=chen06], the realization of entanglement between a pair of distant ensembles [\cite=chou05] [\cite=laurat07b] and, more recently, entanglement distribution involving two pairs of ensembles [\cite=chou07]. The first step toward entanglement swapping has been made [\cite=laurat07a] and light-matter teleportation has been demonstrated [\cite=pan07].

In all these cases, progress has relied upon probabilistic schemes following the measurement-induced approach developed in the seminal paper by Duan, Lukin, Cirac and Zoller [\cite=duan01] (DLCZ) and subsequent extensions. For the DLCZ protocol, heralded entanglement is generated by detecting a single photon emitted indistinguishably by one of two ensembles. Intrinsically, the probability p to prepare entanglement with only 1 excitation shared between two ensembles is related to the quality of entanglement, since the likelihood for contamination of the entangled state by processes involving 2 excitations scales as p [\cite=laurat07b], and results in low success probability for each trial. Although the degree of stored entanglement can approach unity for the (rare) successful trials [\cite=laurat07b], the condition [formula] dictates reductions in count rate and compromises in the quality of the resulting entangled state (e.g., as [formula], processes such as stray light scattering and detector dark counts become increasingly important). Furthermore, for finite memory time, subsequent connection of entanglement becomes increasingly challenging [\cite=laurat07a].

The separation of processes for the generation of entanglement and for its storage enables this drawback to be overcome. Here, we demonstrate such a division by way of reversible mapping of an entangled state into a quantum memory. The mapping is obtained by using adiabatic passage based upon dynamic Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) [\cite=Fleischhauer00] [\cite=kash99] [\cite=Harris97] [\cite=Hau99] (See Appendix). Storage and retrieval of a single photon have been demonstrated previously [\cite=Chaneliere05] [\cite=Eisaman05]. Adiabatic transfer of a collective excitation has been demonstrated between two ensembles coupled by a cavity mode [\cite=vuletic07], which can provide a suitable approach for generating on-demand entanglement over short distances. However, for efficient distribution of entanglement over quantum networks, reversible mapping of an entangled state between matter and light, as illustrated in Fig. [\ref=setup]a, has not been addressed until now.

In our experiment, entanglement between two atomic ensembles La,Ra is created by first splitting a single photon into two modes Lin,Rin to generate an entangled state of light [\cite=tan91] [\cite=Jacques07] [\cite=hessmo04]. This entangled field state is then coherently mapped to an entangled matter state for La,Ra. On demand, the stored atomic entanglement for La,Ra is reversibly converted back into entangled photonic modes Lout,Rout. As opposed to the original DLCZ scheme, our approach is inherently deterministic, suffering principally from the finite efficiency with which single excitations can be mapped to and from an atomic memory, which can approach 45% [\cite=Novikova07]. Moreover, the contamination of entanglement for the La,Ra ensembles from processes involving 2 excitations can be arbitrarily suppressed (independent of the mapping probabilities) with continuing advances in on-demand single photon sources [\cite=Lounis05]. Our experiment thereby provides a promising avenue to distribute and store entanglement deterministically over remote atomic ensembles for quantum networks [\cite=Sangouard07].

The experimental setup is depicted in Fig. [\ref=setup]. Our single photon source is based on Raman transitions in an optically thick cesium ensemble [\cite=duan01] [\cite=laurat06] (See Appendix). This system generates 25 ns-long single photons (resonant with the [formula] transition) in a heralded fashion [\cite=laurat06]. The single photons are polarized at 45[formula] from the eigen-polarizations of the beam displacer BD1 (Fig. 1b), which splits them into entangled optical modes Lin,Rin (called the signal modes) to produce, in the ideal case, the state [formula].

The next stage consists in coherently mapping photonic entanglement for Lin,Rin into atomic ensembles La,Ra (called the memory ensembles) within a single cloud of cold cesium atoms in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) (Fig. 1c). Ensembles La,Ra are defined by the well-separated optical paths of the entangled photonic modes Lin,Rin. To avoid dissipative absorption for the fields in modes Lin,Rin for our choice of polarization [\cite=Chaneliere05], we initially spin-polarize the atomic ensemble into |F = 4,mF = 0〉 (See Appendix). A synchronous clock governs the trials of both the single photon source and memory ensembles with a period of 575 ns. Initially, the strong control fields Ω(L,R)c (resonant with the [formula] transition) open transparency windows Ω(L,R)c(0) in La,Ra for the signal modes. As the wavepacket of the signal field propagates through each ensemble, the control fields Ω(L,R)c(t) are turned off in 20 ns by an intensity modulator, thus coherently transforming the fields of the respective signal modes to collective atomic excitations within La,Ra. This mapping leads to heralded entanglement between ensembles La,Ra. After a user-defined delay, chosen here to be 1.1 μs, the atomic entanglement is converted back into entangled photonic modes by switching on the control fields Ω(L,R)c(t) (See Appendix).

For a given optical depth γ, there is an optimal Rabi frequency Ωc(t) for the control field. In our experiment, the measured γ and Ωc(0) are 15 and 24 MHz, respectively. An example of our measurements of the EIT process for a single ensemble is presented in Fig. [\ref=srcoherent], which shows in (a) the input single-photon pulse and in (b) its storage and retrieval (See Appendix). Due to finite γ and small length ([formula] mm) of the ensemble, there is considerable loss in the storage process, as evidenced by the counts around τ = 0 μs in (b). The peak beyond τ = 1 μs represents the retrieved pulse after 1.1 μs of storage. Overall, we find good agreement between our measurements and the results from a numerical calculation following the methods of [\cite=Fleischhauer00], using the fitted function of the input signal field (Fig. [\ref=srcoherent]a) as the initial condition with all other parameters from independent measurements. The overall storage and retrieval efficiency is measured to be [formula], also in agreement with the simulation.

With these results in hand for the individual La,Ra ensembles, we next turn to the question of verification of entanglement for the input Lin,Rin and output Lout,Rout optical modes. We follow the protocol introduced in Ref. [\cite=chou05] by (1) reconstructing a reduced density matrix ρ constrained to a subspace containing no more than one excitation in each mode, and (2) assuming that all off-diagonal elements between states with different numbers of photons vanish, thereby obtaining a lower bound for any purported entanglement. In the photon-number basis |nL,mR〉 with {n,m}  =  {0,1}, the reduced density matrix ρ is written as [\cite=chou05]

[formula]

Here, pij is the probability to find i photons in mode Lk and j in mode Rk, [formula] is the coherence between |1L0R〉k and |0L1R〉k, P = p00 + p01 + p10 + p11, and V is the visibility for interference between modes Lk,Rk, with k∈{in,out}. The degree of entanglement of ρ can be quantified in terms of the concurrence [formula] which is a monotone function of entanglement, ranging from 0 for a separable state to 1 for a maximally entangled state [\cite=wooters98].

Operationally, the various elements of ρ are obtained by recombining the Lk,Rk fields with a second beam displacer, BD2, as illustrated in Fig. [\ref=setup]d, to obtain a single spatial mode with orthogonal polarizations for the Lk,Rk fields [\cite=chou07] [\cite=laurat07b]. The diagonal elements of ρ are measured with (λ / 2)v set at [formula] so that detection events at D1,D2 are recorded directly for the Lk,Rk fields. To determine the off-diagonal components of ρ, the modes Lk,Rk are brought into interference with (λ / 2)v set at [formula], as shown in Fig. [\ref=setup]d. By varying the relative phase φrel between the modes, we determine the visibility for single-photon interference and thereby deduce d.

We first perform tomography on the input modes Lin,Rin to verify that they are indeed entangled. To this end, we remove the memory ensembles to transmit directly the signal fields into the verification stage, following our protocol of complementary measurements. The interference fringe between the two input modes is shown in Fig. [\ref=fringe]a. From the independently determined propagation and detection efficiencies, our measurements at D1,D2 can be used to infer the quantum state for the input modes Lin,Rin entering the input faces of the atomic ensembles La,Ra [\cite=chou05], with the reconstructed density matrix ρin also given in Fig. [\ref=fringe]a. The concurrence derived from ρin is Cin = 0.10  ±  0.02, so that the fields for Lin,Rin are indeed entangled. The value of the concurrence is in good agreement with the independently derived expectation of Ctheoryin = 0.10  ±  0.01, which depends on the quality of the single photon and the vacuum component (i.e., the overall efficiency) [\cite=laurat07b]. Given a heralding click from our single photon source, the probability to have a single photon at the face of either memory ensemble is 15%, leading to a vacuum component of 85%. We also independently characterize the suppression w of the two-photon component relative to a coherent state (for which w = 1) and find [formula]. Our input entanglement is only limited by the current properties of our single-photon source, which will be improved with the rapid advances in sources of single photons [\cite=Lounis05].

Having verified entanglement for the input modes Lin,Rin, we next map this photonic entanglement into the La,Ra ensembles, which serve as a quantum memory (Fig. [\ref=setup]c). After storing the entanglement for 1.1 μs, we transfer the resulting atomic excitation from the memory to the output modes Lout,Rout and perform quantum-state tomography to determine ρout precisely as for ρin. As shown in Fig. [\ref=fringe], the visibility for interference of the fields after storage and retrieval shows no appreciable degradation (from [formula] to [formula]). From the measurements at D1,D2, we infer the quantum state ρout at the output faces of the La,Ra ensembles, with the result displayed in Fig. [\ref=fringe]b. The associated concurrence [formula] is in agreement with [formula]. Since the mapping of the atomic states from La,Ra into field modes Lout,Rout is a local operation, this measurement provides a lower bound for the entanglement between the La,Ra ensembles [\cite=chou05]. Thus, we demonstrate the reversible mapping of an entangled state of the electromagnetic field to and from a material system. For completeness, Table I gives the diagonal elements and concurrences of in,out determined directly at D1,D2 without correction for propagation and detection efficiencies.

We emphasize that although the entanglement associated with ρout is heralded (because of the nature of our source of single photons), our protocol for generation and storage of entanglement is intrinsically deterministic. The transfer efficiency of entanglement from input modes to output modes of the quantum memory is limited by the storage and retrieval efficiency ηr of the EIT process. This transfer can be quantified by the ratio λ of the concurrence Cout for the output state ρout to Cin for the input state ρin. For an ideal source of single photons on-demand (with no vacuum component), the input concurrence is approximated by Cin≃αV, where α denotes the transmission efficiency of the single photon from the source to the entangler in Fig. [\ref=setup]b [\cite=laurat07b]. Similarly, for the output, Cout≃αηrV, where we assume that the visibility V is preserved by the mapping processes. Thus, [formula], which therefore estimates the maximum amount of entanglement in modes Lout,Rout for the case of an (ideal) single photon generated deterministically. In our experiment, the entanglement transfer reaches [formula].

The performance of our quantum interface depends also on the memory lifetime τm over which one can faithfully retrieve a stored quantum state. For our system, independent measurements of ηr made by varying the storage duration τ allow us to determine [formula] μs, as limited by inhomogeneous Zeeman broadening [\cite=Hugues05] and misalignment between the quantization axis and the bias magnetic field (See Appendix). Active and passive compensations of the residual magnetic field would improve τm [\cite=ringot01], along with improved optical trapping techniques.

In conclusion, our work provides the first realization of mapping an entangled state into and out of a quantum memory. Our protocol alleviates the significant drawback of probabilistic protocols [\cite=duan01], where low preparation probabilities prevent its potential scalability [\cite=laurat07a], and thus our strategy leads to efficient scaling for high-fidelity quantum communication [\cite=Sangouard07]. Our current results are limited by the large vacuum component of our available single photon source, which principally reduces the degree of entanglement in the input, and by the limited retrieval efficiency of the EIT process, which bounds the entanglement transfer [formula]. However, with extension to an on-demand single photon source and with improved retrieval efficiency, pushed already to 45% in Ref. [\cite=Novikova07] by larger optical depth and optimum pulse shaping, our protocol provides an alternate strategy for generating and distributing entanglement between remote quantum memories that circumvents some difficulties with the original DLCZ protocol [\cite=duan01].

APPENDIX

I. Experimental details.

A 22 ms preparation stage and 3 ms experiment run are conducted every 25 ms period. During the preparation stage, atomic ensembles are loaded in a MOT for 18 ms and further cooled by optical molasses for 3 ms. For 800 μs, we optically pump the atomic ensembles to the 6S1 / 2,F = 4,mF = 0 state in atomic cesium. During this stage, the trapping beam is turned off while the intensity of the repumping beam is reduced to 0.1Isat. The quantization axis is chosen along the k-vector of the signal modes and defined by a pulsed magnetic field of 0.2 G. A pair of counter-propagating Zeeman pumping beams (10 MHz red-detuned from [formula] and linearly polarized along the quantization axis) illuminate the ensembles in a direction perpendicular to modes Lin,Rin. The MOT repumping beam serves as a hyperfine pumping beam. The experiment is conducted at repetition rate of 1.7 MHz during a 3 ms interval before the next MOT loading cycle. A small bias field of 10 mG is left on to define the quantization axis for the experiment.

II. Single photon generation.

The single-photon source is based upon the protocol [\cite=duan01] [\cite=laurat06] composed of time-delayed photon pairs, called fields 1,2 emitted from a cesium ensemble in a MOT called the source ensemble, located 3 m from the memory ensembles. For photon-pair production, a sequence of write and read pulses illuminates the source ensemble. The single photon generation is heralded by probabilistic detection of a Raman scattered field 1 from a write pulse. Conditioned on the heralding signal, a strong read pulse maps the excitation into a photonic mode, field 2, with probability of 50%, which then propagates to the setup described in Fig. [\ref=setup]. The resulting conditional probability to have a single photon, field 2, at the face of memory ensemble is 15%. The heralding signal triggers a control logic which disables the single-photon source and all associated laser beams for the programmable duration of the storage process for the quantum interface.

III. EIT storage and retrieval.

The coherent interface between the signal modes and collective spin waves is achieved by dynamically controlling the EIT window Ωc(t), defined by the atom-light interaction of a resonant control field. A quantum field propagating through an externally controlled dressed state medium is best described as a slow-light, dark-state polariton (DSP), Ψ̂(z,t) [\cite=Fleischhauer00], a coherent mixture of matter-like and photonic excitations, expressed as

[formula]

where [formula], N is the number of atoms, σ̂ab is the atomic coherence operator for ground states |a〉,|b〉, and Ωc(t) is the Rabi frequency of control field. As the signal field propagates through the medium, the group velocity υg of the DSP is adiabatically reduced to zero as Ωc(t) decreases to zero, thereby rotating θ(t) from a purely photonic state to a matter-like collective spin coherence. When the control field is re-activated, the collective spin excitation is coherently converted into a photonic mode in a time-reversal fashion.
