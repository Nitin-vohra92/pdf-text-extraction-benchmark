Electrostatics in a wormhole geometry

The physical effects in wormholes has been a subject of considerable investigation. The present work is devoted to solving the electrostatic equation in closed form in the background metric of Morris and Thorne [\cite=morris] which describes a simple wormhole. We take up again the question of the electrostatic self-energy analysed by Khusnutdinov and Bakhmatov [\cite=khus] in the framework of the multipole formalism. We emphasize that we consider electrostatics in a static spherically symmetric wormhole connecting two different asymptotically flat spacetimes. Of course, electromagnetism in a static spherically symmetric wormhole connecting two distant regions in the same spacetime is radically different [\cite=frolov].

In the paper of Morris and Thorne [\cite=morris], a simple geometry of wormhole is described by the metric

[formula]

in the coordinate system (t,l,θ,φ) with -    ∞   < l <   ∞  . The throat is located at l = 0. The two different asymptotically flat spacetimes are defined for l  →    ±    ∞  .

To solve in the next the electrostatic equation, it is convenient to write metric ([\ref=m1]) in isotropic coordinates (t,r,θ,φ). The radial cordinate r is related to the proper radial coordinate l by

[formula]

with the range 0 < r <   ∞  . Now the throat is located at r = w / 2. We note that

[formula]

and thus coordinate transformation ([\ref=c1]) is valid eveywhere. The inverse transformation is given by

[formula]

Taking into account ([\ref=c1]), metric ([\ref=m1]) is written as

[formula]

in the coordinate system (t,r,θ,φ) with r > 0.

We set the Cartesian coordinates (xi), i = 1,2,3, associated to the spherical coordinates (r,θ,φ). Metric ([\ref=m2]) takes then the form

[formula]

with [formula].

In the background metric ([\ref=m3]), we consider a test electromagnetic field generated by a point charge e at rest. The charge density ρ of this point charge located at xi0 has the expression

[formula]

where g is the determinant of the metric ([\ref=m3]),

[formula]

We note (r0,θ0,φ0) the position of the point charge with r0 > 0.

The Maxwell equations in metric ([\ref=m3]) for the electric component A of the electromagnetic potential reduce with source ([\ref=j]) to the electrostatic equation

[formula]

where [formula] is the Laplacian operator and the function h has the expression

[formula]

The aim of this work is to determine in closed form the solution to equation ([\ref=e]) which is smooth everywhere except of course at the point xi0.

In a recent paper [\cite=linet], we have shown that if h obeys certain differential relations then there exists a solution to equation ([\ref=e]) which can be written in the form

[formula]

with

[formula]

where Γ(xi,xi0) = (x1 - x10)2 + (x2 - xi0)2 + (x3 - x30)2. The functions g, k and F are to be determined and N is a numerical factor.

The first step is to determine the elementary function in the Hadamard sense Ae to equation ([\ref=e]). This solution is defined by requiring in the vicinity of the point xi0 the following development:

[formula]

In the case of metric ([\ref=m3]), we have from ([\ref=e]) the first coefficient

[formula]

By inserting expression ([\ref=h]) into the differential relation of our previous paper [\cite=linet], we obtain

[formula]

In consequence, we know to be able to find a solution in form ([\ref=a]) by considering the case II of our paper. By comparing, we put a = w / 2, b = w / 2 and A =  - 4. The functions g and k are then given by

[formula]

and the differential equation for F is

[formula]

According to ([\ref=s]) with ([\ref=gk]), we have 0  ≤  s  ≤  1.

We are now in a position to determine in closed form the elementary solution in the Hadamard sense Ae to equation ([\ref=f]) by taking as solution Fe to equation ([\ref=f])

[formula]

since

[formula]

Using ([\ref=a]), we get finally

[formula]

with N = w / 2 to satisfy ([\ref=da]). We can directly verify that Ae given by expression ([\ref=ae]) obeys the partial differential equation ([\ref=e]).

However, we are in a case where solution ([\ref=ae]) presents another singularity. Indeed, it defines a new point charge e diametrically opposed to xi0 on the sphere r = r1 with r1 = w2 / 4r0. This corresponds to s = 1 in expression ([\ref=fe]) since

[formula]

We must look for another solution Fv to equation ([\ref=f]) which leads only a point charge located at xi0. We take the solution

[formula]

The regularity at s = 1 of expression ([\ref=fv]) results from the fact that arcsin ( - 1) =  - π / 2. We note the expansion of function ([\ref=fv])

[formula]

This choice of function Fv yields the electrostatic potential V generated by a point charge e located at xi0

[formula]

We point out that the electric flux through the sphere at the infinity r  →    ∞   of the electrostatic potential ([\ref=av]) is

[formula]

We have the opportunity to add to potential ([\ref=av]) the electrostatic monopole solution to equation ([\ref=e]) which is smooth everywhere but we have no prescription to fix this homogeneous solution.

We turn now to calculate the electrostatic self-energy. We develop expression ([\ref=av]) in the vicinity of the point xi0 by using expansion ([\ref=dfv]). We get

[formula]

Thus, the electrostatic self-energy W of the point charge e at rest in the wormhole geometry ([\ref=m3]) can be immediately deduces from development ([\ref=dav])

[formula]

The electrostatic self-energy ([\ref=wr]) can be expressed with the proper radial coordinate l in the form

[formula]

Result ([\ref=wl]) coincides with the one of Khusnutdinov and Bakhmatov [\cite=khus].
