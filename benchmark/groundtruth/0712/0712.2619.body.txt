A New Lower Bound for

Introduction

Let A(n,d,w) denote the maximum possible number of codewords in a binary code of length n, minimal distance d and constant weight w. The Nordstrom-Robinson code N16 of length 16, minimal distance 6, and containing 256 codewords has weight enumerator 1 + 112x6 + 30x8 + 112x10 + x16. Hence, taking all the codewords of weight 6 in N16 gives a constant weight code that shows A(16,6,6)  ≥  112. Since A(17,6,6)  ≥  A(16,6,6), we also have A(17,6,6)  ≥  112. This is in fact the best lower bound on A(17,6,6) known [\cite=Brouweretal90].

In this note, we give the first improvement on the lower bound for A(17,6,6) since that implied by the 1967 result of Nordstrom and Robinson [\cite=NordstromRobinson67]. We exhibit a new binary code C of length 17, minimal distance 6, constant weight 6, and containing 113 codewords, showing A(17,6,6)  ≥  113. Our code has no particular structure (its automorphism group is trivial) and is obtained through a combination of search techniques involving simulated annealing [\cite=NurmelaOstergard93], length-reduction [\cite=Awetal03], and local optimization.

The support supp(x) of a codeword [formula] is the set of indices of its non-zero coordinates, that is, [formula]. The supports of the codewords in C are listed in the next section.
