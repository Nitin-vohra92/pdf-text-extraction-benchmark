On simultaneous rational approximations to a real number, its square, and its cube

Introduction

In a remarkable paper [\cite=DSb], H. Davenport and W. M. Schmidt showed that, for any integer n  ≥  2 and for any real number ξ which is not algebraic over [formula] of degree at most n - 1, there exist infinitely many algebraic integers α of degree at most n satisfying

[formula]

where c = c(n,ξ) > 0 is an appropriate constant depending only on n and ξ, and where τ(2) = 2, [formula], τ(4) = 3 and τ(n) = ⌊(n + 1) / 2⌋ if n  ≥  5. For n = 2,3, this value of τ(n) cannot be improved (see [\cite=DSb] for the case n = 2 and [\cite=Rc] for the case n = 3). For n  ≥  4, M. Laurent showed in [\cite=La] that τ(n) can be taken to be ⌈(n + 1) / 2⌉. However, at present, no optimal value for τ(n) is known for any single value of n  ≥  4. Furthermore, we possess no non-trivial upper bound for τ(n) for n  ≥  4, besides the estimate τ(n)  ≤  n coming from metrical considerations (by an application of the Borel-Cantelli lemma as in the proof of [\cite=Bu]). Although, we shall not go into this, let us simply mention that the situation is similar in the case of approximation by algebraic numbers of degree at most n. In this case, it is only for n  ≤  2 that the optimal exponents are known, the case n = 2 being due once again to Davenport and Schmidt [\cite=DSa].

Several years ago, I started working on finding an optimal value for τ(4) (in the above notation) and, despite of much effort, I was not successful. My hopes were that this would lead to a new class of extremal numbers, similar to that of [\cite=Ra] or [\cite=Rb], and that such construction could be generalized to larger values of n to provide a non-trivial upper-bound for the corresponding values of τ(n), and maybe settle the question as to whether lim sup n  →    ∞τ(n) / n is equal to 1 or strictly smaller than 1. These problems remain open.

The method initiated by Davenport and Schmidt in [\cite=DSb] for estimating τ(n) is based on geometry of numbers and requires an upper bound on the uniform exponent of simultaneous approximation of the first n - 1 consecutive powers of a real number ξ by rational numbers with the same denominator. By [\cite=DSb], our main result below implies that τ(4) can be taken to be [formula], where

[formula]

Let [formula] with  > 3, and let c and λ be positive real numbers. Suppose that for any sufficiently large value of X, the inequalities

[formula]

admit a non-zero solution [formula]. Then, we have λ  ≤  λ3. Moreover, if λ  =  λ3, then c is bounded below by a positive constant depending only on ξ.

The rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of this result which, through its weaker hypothesis on ξ, complements [\cite=DSb]. The tools that we use for the proof are the same as those of [\cite=DSb] together with results on heights of subspaces of [formula] defined over [formula] that were developed around the same period of time by W. M. Schmidt in [\cite=Sa]. Using other tools, similar to the bracket

[formula]

First considerations

Throughout this paper, we fix a real number ξ with  > 3 and positive constants λ, c  satisfying the hypotheses of the Theorem. In all statements below, the implied constants in the symbols ≫  , ≪   and [formula] (the conjunction of ≫   and ≪  ) depend only on ξ and λ (not on c). In particular, we may assume that c  ≪  1. Our goal is to show that λ  ≤  λ3 and that c  ≫  1 in case of equality. By [\cite=DSb], we already have λ  ≤  1 / 2.

For each integer n  ≥  1 and each point [formula], we define points of [formula] and [formula] of [formula] by

[formula]

We also put

[formula]

Finally, we say that a point [formula] is primitive if it is non-zero and if the gcd of its coordinates is 1. Then, the hypothesis implies that, for any sufficiently large X, there exist a primitive point [formula] with

[formula]

where c1 = 2 max {1,|ξ|}3λ. The following lemmas extend results of Davenport and Schmidt in [\cite=DSb].

Let [formula] and [formula] with n∈{1,2,3}. Then, [formula] satisfies

[formula]

for some constant c2 = c2(ξ). Moreover if [formula] and if C and [formula] are non-zero and primitive, we have

[formula]

Write C = (a,b). Then, the estimates in [\eqref=lemma:pointy:eq] follow respectively from the formulas [formula] and [formula], upon choosing c2 so that [formula] and [formula]. If [formula] and C  ≠  0, then [formula] is a rational multiple of the geometric progression [formula]. If furthermore C and [formula] are primitive, this progression is a primitive point of [formula] and so it coincides with [formula]. This gives [formula] and [formula].

Suppose that λ > 1 / 3. Then for any non-zero point [formula] we have [formula].

Since [formula], we have L(C)  ≠  0 for any non-zero point [formula]. So, it suffices to prove that [formula] for primitive points [formula] of sufficiently large norm. Let C be a primitive point of [formula], and let [formula] be a primitive solution of [\eqref=main_cond] for the choice of [formula], where c2 is the constant introduced in Lemma [\ref=lemma:pointy]. Since λ > 1 / 3, we have [formula] if [formula], and then the second part of Lemma [\ref=lemma:pointy] shows that [formula] is a non-zero point of [formula]. Applying the first part of the same lemma, we deduce that

[formula]

and so [formula].

Suppose that λ > 1 / 3. Then, there exist at most finitely many points [formula] with [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] are linearly dependant over [formula].

Suppose on the contrary that the conclusion is false. Then, there exist infinitely many primitive points [formula] of [formula] with [formula] for which [formula] and [formula] are linearly dependant. For each of them, there exists a primitive point [formula] such that [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lemma:pointy], we have [formula] and [formula]. Thus [formula] tends to infinity with [formula], and the condition [formula] translates into [formula]. Since - 2 - 3λ  <   - 3  <   - 1 / λ, this contradicts Lemma [\ref=lemma:minoreLC].

Let n∈{1,2,3} and let U be a proper subspace of [formula] defined over [formula]. Then, the function [formula] is bounded from below by a positive constant on the set of all non-zero points [formula] of [formula].

As in the proof of [\cite=DSb], suppose on the contrary that there exists a sequence of non-zero integral points [formula] in U such that [formula]. Then, for any sufficiently large index i, the first coordinate xi,0 of [formula] is non-zero and the product [formula] converges to [formula] as i tends to infinity. Thus, the point [formula] belongs to U. This is impossible since U is a proper subspace of [formula] defined over [formula] while the coordinates of the point [formula] are linearly independent over [formula].

Finally, we note that there exists a sequence of non-zero points [formula] in [formula] with the following properties:

the positive integers [formula] form a strictly increasing sequence,

the positive real numbers [formula] form a strictly decreasing sequence,

if some non-zero point [formula] satisfies [formula] for some i  ≥  1, then [formula].

We fix such a choice of sequence [formula] and refer to it as the sequence of minimal points for ξ although it is not unique and differs from the notion introduced by Davenport and Schmidt in [\cite=DSb]. We note that, for each i  ≥  1, [formula] is a primitive point of [formula] and, since [\eqref=main_cond] admits a non-zero solution [formula] for each X with Xi  ≤  X  <  Xi + 1 when i is sufficiently large, we deduce from the condition (c) that

[formula]

for each large enough index i. We will use this property repeatedly in the sequel, either in this form or in the weaker form Li  ≪  cX-  λi + 1  ≪  X-  λi + 1.

A family of planes in [formula]

For each integer n  ≥  1 and each subspace S of [formula] defined over [formula] of dimension p > 0, we define the height H(S) of S by [formula] where [formula] is a basis of the group [formula] of integral points of S (upon identifying [formula] with [formula] through an ordering of the Grassmann coordinates, as in [\cite=Sb]). We also define H(0) = 1. Then, it follows from [\cite=Sb] that, for any pair of subspaces S and T of [formula] defined over [formula], we have

[formula]

with a constant c(n) > 0 depending only on n. We also recall that [formula] where [formula] stands for the orthogonal complement of S in [formula] (see [\cite=Sb]).

For each i  ≥  2, we denote by Wi the subspace of [formula] of dimension 2 generated by [formula] and [formula]. We also introduce a new parameter

[formula]

and note that θ  ≥  1 since λ  ≤  1 / 2.

For each i  ≥  2, the points [formula] and [formula] form a basis of [formula], and we have:   [formula].

This follows by a simple adaptation of the proofs of [\cite=DSa] and [\cite=Rb], the difference being that here Xi stands for the norm of [formula] instead of the absolute value of its first coordinate. We now look at sums Wi + Wi + 1.

There exist infinitely many indices i  ≥  2 such that Wi  ≠  Wi + 1. For each of them, we have

[formula]

If there were only finitely many indices i  ≥  2 for which Wi  ≠  Wi + 1, then all points [formula] with i sufficiently large would lie in a fixed subspace W of [formula] defined over [formula], against Lemma [\ref=lemma:fonctionL]. This proves the first assertion of the lemma.

Applying [\eqref=est:height_sum_inter] with S = Wi and T = Wj, we find

[formula]

For each index i  ≥  2 such that Wi  ≠  Wi + 1, we have [formula] and so [formula]. This leads to the first estimate in [\eqref=est:HWi+Wi+1]. For the second one, we simply use the upper bound Xi  ≫  H(Wi)1 / (1 - λ) coming from Lemma [\ref=lemma:hauteurWi].

We denote by I the set of indices i  ≥  2 for which Wi  ≠  Wi + 1.

Thus, for each i∈I, the sum [formula] is a 3-dimensional subspace of [formula] defined over [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lemma:fonctionL] such a subspace of [formula] contains at most finitely many minimal points. This leads to the first assertion of the next lemma.

There exist infinitely many pairs of consecutive elements i,  j of I with i < j and Wi + Wi + 1  ≠  Wj + Wi + 1. For such a pair of integers, we have

For consecutive elements i < j of I, we have Wi  ≠  Wi + 1  =  Wj  ≠  Wj + 1. If Wi + Wi + 1 and Wj + Wj + 1 are distinct subspaces of [formula], their sum is the whole of [formula] and their intersection is Wi + 1 = Wj. Since [formula], we deduce from [\eqref=est:height_sum_inter] that

[formula]

Combining this estimate with the upper bounds

[formula]

provided by Lemma [\ref=lemma:Hsomme], we obtain [\eqref=est:generale]. Then combining [\eqref=est:generale] with the standard upper bounds H(Wi)  ≪  X1 - λi and H(Wj)  ≪  X1 - λj coming from Lemma [\ref=lemma:hauteurWi], we find

[formula]

and so H(Wi)H(Wj)  ≪  (XiXj)1 - λ  ≪  H(Wj + 1)θ  ≪  Xθ(1 - λ)j + 1, which proves [\eqref=est:paire].

A family of points in [formula]

For each pair of points [formula] and [formula] in [formula], we define

[formula]

To alleviate the notation, we also write

[formula]

for each pair of integers i,j  ≥  1. These points Ci,j play a crucial role in the proof of the inequality λ  ≤  1 / 2 by Davenport and Schmidt in [\cite=DSb]. They also play an important role in the present work. We first prove general estimates.

For any pair of integers i,j  ≥  1, we have

[formula]

The estimate for [formula] is standard (see for example the proof of [\cite=DSb]). For the other quantity, we find

[formula]

The next lemma provides a sharper upper bound for L(Ci,i + 1) when i∈I.

Let i < j be consecutive elements of I. Then, we have Ci,j = bCi,i + 1 for some non-zero integer b with [formula], and

[formula]

Since i and j are consecutive in I, we have Wi + 1 = Wj. Moreover since [formula] and [formula] form a basis of the group of integral points of Wi + 1, there exist non-zero integers a and b such that [formula]. If Xj  >  3|b|Xi + 1, we deduce that

[formula]

and so |a|  >  2|b|. Then, we find Lj  ≥  |a|Li  -  |b|Li + 1  >  |b|Li + 1  ≥  Li + 1, which is impossible. This contradiction shows that |b|  ≥  Xj  /  (3Xi + 1). Since the point [formula] is a linear function of [formula] and since [formula] for any [formula], we also have

[formula]

and so, by Lemma [\ref=lemma:Cij], we obtain (since λ  ≤  1 / 2  ≤  1)

[formula]

Although we will not use this here, it is interesting to note that the identity

[formula]

which holds for any quadruple of points [formula] in [formula], specializes to

[formula]

when we apply it to the quadruple [formula] for a choice of integers i,j  ≥  1.

A family of planes in [formula]

From now on, we assume that λ > 1 / 3. Then, by Lemma [\ref=lemma:xmoinsxplus], there exists an index i0 such that [formula] and [formula] are linearly independent for each i  ≥  i0. For those values of i, we denote by Vi the two-dimensional subspace of [formula] spanned by these points:

[formula]

Since [formula] tends to 0 as j  →    ∞  , it follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:fonctionL] that each Vi contains at most finitely many points of the form [formula] or [formula], and so there are infinitely many indices i  ≥  i0 such that Vi  ≠  Vi + 1. We also note that, for i,j  ≥  i0, we have

[formula]

by definition of the points Ci,j (see §[\ref=sec:C]). In [\cite=DSb], Davenport and Schmidt argue that, for each i  ≥  i0 such that Vi  ≠  Vi + 1, we have [formula] (see Lemma [\ref=lemma:Cij]). Since i can be taken to be arbitrarily large, this gives 1 - 2λ  ≥  0 and so λ  ≤  1 / 2.

There exist infinitely many integers i > i0 for which Vi - 1  ≠  Vi. For each of them, we have,

[formula]

In particular, this leads to symmetric estimates Xi + 1  ≪  Xθi and H(Wi + 1)  ≪  H(Wi)θ.

The first assertion being already settled, fix an index i > i0 such that Vi - 1  ≠  Vi. Then the integral point Ci,i - 1 is non-zero and so its norm is bounded below by 1. The absolute values of its coordinates are:

[formula]

Since [formula] and [formula] are bounded above by [formula], this means that [formula]. Thus we obtain

[formula]

and so Xi + 1  ≪  H(Wi)1 / λ. The conclusion follows by combining this result with the estimates H(Wi)  ≪  X1 - λi and H(Wi + 1)  ≪  X1 - λi + 1 coming from Lemma [\ref=lemma:hauteurWi].

Suppose that there exist infinitely many indices i  ≥  i0 such that Vi  =  Vi + 1. Then we have [formula]. Moreover, if [formula], then we also have c  ≫  1.

Since there are infinitely many indices i > i0 for which Vi - 1  ≠  Vi, the hypothesis of the proposition forces the existence of arbitrarily large indices i with

[formula]

Fix such an integer i. Let px0 + qx1 + rx2 = 0 be an equation of Vi with relatively prime coefficients [formula], so that by duality [formula]. For any point [formula] of Wi + 1, we have

[formula]

therefore [formula] and [formula] both belong to Vi + Vi + 1  =  Vi, and so the point [formula] satisfies

[formula]

This means that the orthogonal complement of Wi in [formula] is [formula] and so, applying the duality property of the height again, we find

[formula]

(the relation H(Vi)  ≪  H(Wi + 1)1 / 2 also follows from [\cite=DSb] since the equality Vi = Vi + 1 means that (p,q,r) provides a three terms recurrence relation satisfied both by [formula] and [formula]). We now argue as M. Laurent in the proof of [\cite=La]. Define

[formula]

For any point [formula], we have

[formula]

Applying this estimate to the point [formula], we get

[formula]

Since Vi - 1  ≠  Vi, at least one of the points [formula] or [formula] does not belong to Vi. If [formula] is such a point, then py0 + qy1 + ry2 is a non-zero integer, and using successively [\eqref=prop:Vi:eq2], [\eqref=prop:Vi:eq3] and [\eqref=prop:Vi:eq1] we obtain

[formula]

Moreover, Lemma [\ref=lemma:normeDi] gives H(Wi + 1)  ≪  Xθ(1 - λ)i and so the last estimate leads to

[formula]

As i can be taken to be arbitrarily large, this implies that 2 - (1 + λ)2  ≥  0, and so [formula]. Moreover, we obtain c  ≫  1 if [formula].

Suppose that [formula]. Then, we have Vi - 1  ≠  Vi for any sufficiently large integer i, and the estimates [\eqref=est:Xi+1versusXi] of Lemma [\ref=lemma:normeDi] apply to all integers i  ≥  1. Moreover, for any pair of consecutive integers i < j of I with Wi + Wi + 1  ≠  Wj + Wj + 1, we also have

[formula]

The first assertion follows directly from Lemma [\ref=lemma:normeDi] and the above proposition. To prove the second one, we fix consecutive integers i < j in I with Wi + Wi + 1  ≠  Wj + Wj + 1, and go back to the general estimate [\eqref=est:generale] from Lemma [\ref=lemma:paire]:

[formula]

On the right hand side of this inequality, we apply the standard estimate H(Wi)  ≪  X1 - λi from Lemma [\ref=lemma:hauteurWi] as an upper bound for H(Wi), and the estimate H(Wj + 1)  ≪  H(Wj)θ coming from [\eqref=est:Xi+1versusXi] as an upper bound for H(Wj + 1). On the left hand side, we use instead the estimate H(Wj)  ≪  X1 - λj from Lemma [\ref=lemma:hauteurWi] as a lower bound for Xj. This gives

[formula]

and [\eqref=cor:hauteurs:estij] follows. To prove [\eqref=cor:hauteurs:estjj+1], we note instead that, i and j being consecutive elements of I, we have Wj = Wi + 1 and so [\eqref=cor:hauteurs:eq1] combined with Lemma [\ref=lemma:hauteurWi] gives

[formula]

Moving on the left all powers of Xi and using the estimate Xi + 1  ≪  Xθi from [\eqref=est:Xi+1versusXi] as a lower bound for Xi, we obtain

[formula]

Moving all powers of Xi + 1 on the right and observing that the exponent 1 - λ  -  λ  /  θ  =  1 - 1 / θ is ≥  0 (since θ  ≥  1), we obtain finally

[formula]

which implies [\eqref=cor:hauteurs:estjj+1].

The set J

We assume from now on that [formula]. Then, for each sufficiently large index i, the subspace [formula] of [formula] has dimension 2 and, by Corollary [\ref=cor:hauteurs], we have Vi  ≠  Vi + 1. Consequently, Ci,i + 1 is a non-zero point of [formula] for each i  ≫  1.

Let J be the set of all elements i of I whose successor j in I satisfies Wj + Wj + 1  ≠  Wi + Wi + 1.

By Lemma [\ref=lemma:paire], the set J is infinite. The next result studies a possible configuration of points.

Suppose that [formula], and that h < i < j are three consecutive elements of I with h∈J and i∈J. Then we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lemma:L(Ci] [\ref=i+1)], we have

[formula]

Since i∈J, we have Wi + Wi + 1  ≠  Wj + Wj + 1, and the second part of [\eqref=est:paire] in Lemma [\ref=lemma:paire] gives Since h∈J, we also have Wh + Wh + 1  ≠  Wi + Wi + 1, and the estimates [\eqref=cor:hauteurs:estjj+1] of Corollary [\ref=cor:hauteurs] applied to the pair (h,i) instead of (i,j) lead to Put β  =  (1 - λ) / (λ2  -  λ + 1). Since λ  ≤  1 / 2, we have β  ≥  1 - λ  ≥  1 / 2. We consider two cases.

(a) If Xj  ≥  Xβj + 1, we substitute into [\eqref=lemma:triple:inegalite1] the first of the above two upper bounds for Xi. This gives

[formula]

(b) If on the contrary, we have Xj  <  Xβj + 1, we substitute instead into [\eqref=lemma:triple:inegalite1] the second upper bound for Xi. Again we find

[formula]

upon noting that the exponent (1 - λ)θ  -  λ = (1 - 2λ) / λ is ≥  0.

Suppose that λ  >  λ2 where [formula] denotes the positive root of the polynomial P2(T)  =  3T4 - 4T3 + 2T2 + 2T - 1, and let α be as in Lemma [\ref=lemma:triple]. Then, we have 1 - 2λ  +  α < 0 and, for any triple of consecutive elements h < i < j of I contained in J, with i large enough, the points Ci,i + 1 and Cj,j + 1 are linearly dependent over [formula].

The fact that P2(T) admits exactly one positive root λ2 follows by observing that its second derivative P2''(T) = (6T - 2)2 is non-negative on [formula] and that P2(0) is negative. Consequently, if λ  >  λ2, we have P2(λ) > 0.

For any triple of consecutive elements h < i < j of I contained in J, Lemma [\ref=lemma:triple] gives L(Ci,i + 1)  ≪  Xαj + 1 and L(Cj,j + 1)  ≪  Xαk + 1 where k denotes the successor of j in I. As the general estimates of Lemma [\ref=lemma:Cij] provide [formula] for each [formula], we deduce that

[formula]

As a short computation gives 1 - 2λ  +  α  =   - P2(λ)  /  (λ(λ2  -  λ + 1))  <  0, we conclude that the integer det (Ci,i + 1,Cj,j + 1) vanishes if i is sufficiently large.

Suppose that λ  >  λ2. Then the complement of J in I is infinite.

If [formula] were a finite set, then, by the above proposition, all points Ci,i + 1 with i∈I sufficiently large would belong to the same one-dimensional subspace of [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lemma:fonctionL], this would imply that L(Ci,i + 1)  ≫  1, against the estimates of Lemma [\ref=lemma:triple] since α  <  2λ - 1  ≤  0.

Proof of the theorem

We may assume that [formula]. Then, by Corollary [\ref=cor:JmoinsI], there exist infinitely many triples of elements g  <  i  <  j of I with i and j consecutive satisfying

[formula]

Fix such a triple. Since i and j are consecutive elements of I, we have Wi + 1 = Wj and so

[formula]

Since the sum of Wg + Wg + 1 and Wj + Wj + 1 is the whole of [formula] and that [formula], an application of [\eqref=est:height_sum_inter] gives

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lemma:Hsomme], we have while the estimates [\eqref=est:Xi+1versusXi] of Lemma [\ref=lemma:normeDi] provide Using the latter relations respectively as a lower bound for H(Wg) and as an upper bound for H(Wj + 1) and substituting them into the former, we obtain

[formula]

Since g < i, we have Xg + 1  ≤  Xi and so Lemma [\ref=lemma:hauteurWi] gives

[formula]

We also have

[formula]

by the estimates [\eqref=cor:hauteurs:estij] of Corollary [\ref=cor:hauteurs]. Combining [\eqref=proof:eq0], [\eqref=proof:eq6], [\eqref=proof:eq8] and [\eqref=proof:eq10], we find

[formula]

Since [\eqref=proof:eq10] shows that H(Wj) tends to infinity with i, we conclude that

[formula]

and so θ - 1 / θ  ≥  1 / γ where [formula] (because θ - 1 / θ is ≥  0 and we have 1 / γ2 + 1 / γ = 1). After simplifications, the latter relation implies

[formula]

Since the polynomial T2 - (1 + 2γ)T + γ admits two positive real roots, [formula] and [formula], it follows that λ  ≤  λ3. Moreover, if λ  =  λ3, then [\eqref=proof:eq12] gives c  ≫  1, as announced.
