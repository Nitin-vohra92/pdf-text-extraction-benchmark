Fixed points of circle actions on spaces with rational cohomology of [formula] or [formula]

Introduction

This paper is concerned with the fixed point sets of continuous [formula] actions on certain types of spaces introduced by Toda [\cite=T]. Toda studied the cohomology ring of a space X having only non trivial cohomology groups [formula] for i =  0, 1, 2 and 3, where n is a fixed positive integer. If [formula] is a generator for i =  1, 2 and 3, then the ring structure of [formula] is completely determined by the integers a and b such that

[formula]

Such a space is said to be of type (a,b). Note that if n is odd, then u21 = 0 and hence a  =  0. We shall write [formula] if there is an abstract isomorphism of graded rings [formula]. Similarly, by [formula] we mean that [formula], where z is a homogeneous element of degree n.

Recall that, given spaces Xi with chosen base points xi∈Xi for i =  1, 2, ..., n, their wedge sum [formula] is the quotient of the disjoint union [formula] obtained by identifying the points x1,x2,...,xn to a single point. It is clear that if b  ≠  0, then

[formula]

or

[formula]

And, if b  =  0, then

[formula]

or

[formula]

Let the group [formula] act continuously on a space X of type (a,b). This gives a fibration [formula] called Borel fibration (see [\cite=Bo], Chapter IV). Here XG = (X  ×  EG) / G is the orbit space of the diagonal action on X  ×  EG and BG is the base space of the universal principal G-bundle [formula]. We say that X is totally non-homologous to zero in XG if the inclusion of a typical fiber [formula] induces a surjection in the cohomology [formula]. This condition is equivalent to a nice relation between the ranks of the cohomology of the space and the fixed point set (Proposition 3).

The cohomological nature of the fixed point sets of actions of cyclic groups [formula] on spaces of type (a,b) has been studied in detail. For any prime p, when [formula] mod p, Bredon ([\cite=B1], [\cite=B2]) and Su ([\cite=S1], [\cite=S2]) have investigated the fixed point sets of [formula] actions. For odd primes p, when [formula] mod p, Dotzel and Singh ([\cite=D1], [\cite=D2]) have determined the cohomological nature of the fixed point sets of [formula] actions. Singh [\cite=Si] has investigated the fixed point sets for p  =  2 and [formula] mod 2. For b  ≠  0, the cohomological nature of the fixed point sets of [formula] actions has been studied in detail by Bredon ([\cite=B1], [\cite=B2]). The aim of this paper is to study [formula] actions for the case b = 0 and determine the possible fixed point sets up to rational cohomology.

Before we state our results, recall that, a paracompact Hausdorff space is said to be finitistic if every open covering has a finite dimensional open refinement, where the dimension of a covering is one less than the maximum number of members of the covering which intersect non-trivially. The concept of finitistic spaces was introduced by Swan [\cite=Swan] for his work in fixed point theory. It is a large class of spaces including all compact Hausdorff spaces and all paracompact spaces of finite covering dimension. We prove the following results:

Let [formula] act on a finitistic space X of type (a,0) with fixed point set F. Suppose X is totally non-homologous to zero in XG, then F has at most four components satisfying the following:

If F has four components, then each is acyclic and n is even.

If F has three components, then n is even and

[formula] for some even integer 2  ≤  r  ≤  3n.

If F has two components, then either

[formula] or [formula] for some integers 1  ≤  r,s  ≤  3n

or

[formula] for some even integer 2  ≤  r  ≤  n.

If F has one component, then either

[formula] for some interers 1  ≤  r,s,t  ≤  3n

or

[formula] for some integers 1  ≤  r  ≤  n and 1  ≤  s  ≤  3n.

Moreover, if n is even, then X is always totally non-homologous to zero in XG. Further, all the cases are realizable.

Let [formula] act on a finitistic space X of type (a,0) with fixed point set F. Suppose X is not totally non-homologous to zero in XG, then either F = φ or [formula], where 1  ≤  r  ≤  3n is an odd integer. Moreover, the second possibility is realizable.

In studying group actions it is necessary to count the number of conjugacy classes of isotropy subgroups of the group. If G is a compact Lie group and H is a closed subgroup of G, then let

Preliminaries

For details of most of the content in this section we refer to [\cite=A] and [\cite=B1]. The cohomology used will be the ech cohomology with rational coefficients. We shall use the join [formula] of two spaces X and Y, which is defined as the quotient of X  ×  Y  ×  I under the identifications (x,y1,0)  ~  (x,y2,0) and (x1,y,1)  ~  (x2,y,1), where I is the unit interval. Thus we are collapsing the subspace X  ×  Y  ×  {0} to X and X  ×  Y  ×  {1} to Y. If Y is a two point space, then [formula] is called the suspension of X and is denoted by S(X). Observe that,

if a group G acts on both X and Y with fixed point sets F1 and F2 respectively, then the induced action on the join [formula] has the fixed point set [formula].

a given map f:X  ×  Y  →  Z induces a map [formula] given by

[formula]

We say that a map f:Sn - 1  ×  Sn - 1  →  Sn - 1 has bidegree (α,β), if the map f|Sn - 1  ×  {p2} has degree α and the map f|{p1}  ×  Sn - 1 has degree β, where (p1,p2)∈Sn - 1  ×  Sn - 1. The bidegree of f is independent of the choice of (p1,p2). The following result is well known.

For every even integer n  ≥  2 there is a map φ:Sn - 1  ×  Sn - 1  →  Sn - 1 of bidegree (2, - 1).

Define φ:Sn - 1  ×  Sn - 1  →  Sn - 1 by

[formula]

If we fix x = (1,0,...,0), then φ(x,y) = ( - y1,y2,...,yn) which has degree -1. If we fix y = (1,0,...,0), then φ(x,y) = (1 - 2x12, - 2x1x2,..., - 2x1xn) = g(x) say. Note that g maps the points (0,x2,...,xn) to (1,0,...,0) and is one-to-one for points (x1,x2,...,xn) with x1  ≠  0. Therefore it can be factored into [formula], where the first map has degree 2 and the second map has degree 1 (see [\cite=H] Chapter VII Theorem 10.1). Hence g has degree 2 and φ has bidegree (2, - 1).

Let f:Sn - 1  ×  Sn - 1  →  Sn - 1 be a map of bidegree (α,β) and

[formula]

be the induced map. If Y is the complex obtained by attaching a 2n-cell e2n to Sn via [formula], then for generators [formula] and [formula], we have x2 = h()y for some integer h() called the Hopf invariant of [formula]. A homotopy of [formula] leaves the homotopy type of Y unchanged and so the Hopf invariant is an invariant of the homotopy class of [formula]. The following result relates the Hopf invariant with the bidegree.

h() =   ±  αβ

See [\cite=H], Chapter XIV, 3.5.

The following facts regarding [formula] actions can be easily deduced.

Let [formula] act on a finitistic space X with fixed point set F. Suppose that [formula], then

[formula]

Furthermore, [formula] if and only if X is totally non-homologous to zero in XG.

See [\cite=A], Theorem 3.10.4.

Let [formula] act on a finitistic space X with fixed point set F. Suppose that [formula], then

[formula]

See [\cite=A], Corollary 3.1.13 and Remark 3.10.5 (2).

We now recall a [formula] action on the unit sphere Sn that we shall use in the following sections. For an odd integer n and r = (n + 1) / 2, the unit sphere [formula] has a free [formula] action given by

[formula]

Taking suspension gives a [formula] action on the even dimensional sphere Sn + 1 with exactly two fixed points. We shall also use some elementary notions about vector bundles for which we refer to Husemoller [\cite=H]. An action of a group on a vector bundle will be by bundle maps. Theorem 1 is proved in Section 3 and Theorem 2 is proved in Section 4.

Proof of Theorem 1 and examples

Let X be totally non-homologous to zero in XG. Then by Proposition 3,

[formula]

It is clear that F has at most four components. Case (1) Suppose F has four components, then it is clear that each is acyclic. By Proposition 4, χ(X) = χ(F) = 4 and hence n is even. For a = 0 and even integer n, we can take [formula]. As discussed in the previous section, an even dimensional sphere has a [formula] action with exactly two fixed points. Taking the wedge sum at some fixed points of Sn,S2n and S3n gives a four fixed point [formula] action on X. For a  ≠  0, we know that [formula]. Let n be an even integer, then by Proposition 1, there is a map

[formula]

of bidegree (2, - 1). It is clear that φ is equivariant with respect to the usual O(n) action on Sn - 1 and the diagonal action on Sn - 1  ×  Sn - 1 and hence the induced map

[formula]

is also equivariant with respect to the induced action. Let Xn denote the mapping cone of [formula] which inherits an O(n) action. By Proposition 2, the Hopf invariant of [formula] is -2. Then [formula] and X0 consists of three points. It is clear that if G  ⊂  O(n) acts on [formula] with fixed point set [formula], then the induced action on Xn has fixed point set Xk. Let [formula] acts on [formula] with exactly one fixed point [formula], then it act on Xn with the fixed point set X0. Let [formula] act on S3n with exactly two fixed points, then the wedge sum [formula] at fixed points has a [formula] action with exactly four fixed points.

Case (2) Suppose that F has three components, then

[formula]

Note that χ(F) = 2 or 4 according as r is odd or even. But χ(X) = χ(F) implies that both n and r are even. For a = 0 and even integer 2  ≤  r  ≤  3n - 2, take [formula]. As 1  ≤  (3n - r - 1) is an odd integer, [formula] has a free action on S3n - r - 1 and the (r + 1)-fold suspension gives a [formula] action on S3n with Sr as its fixed point set. Taking a two fixed point action on both Sn and S2n, the wedge sum at fixed points gives a [formula] action on X with the fixed point set [formula]. For a  ≠  0, take [formula]. Taking the above three fixed point action of [formula] on [formula] and the action on S3n with Sr as its fixed point set, the wedge sum gives a [formula] action on X with the desired fixed point set.

Case(3) Suppose F has two components. Then

[formula]

If n is odd, χ(F) = χ(X) = 0 and hence

[formula]

And if n is even, χ(F) = χ(X) = 4 and hence

[formula]

or

[formula]

Let a = 0 and n = 2, 4 or 8. Let Sn - 1 denote the set of complex numbers, quaternions or octanions of norm 1 and

[formula]

be the multiplication of complex numbers, quaternions or octanions for n = 2, 4 or 8 respectively. For n = 2 and 4, let [formula] act on Sn - 1 by

[formula]

and act on Sn - 1  ×  Sn - 1 by

[formula]

Then [formula] acts freely on both Sn - 1 and Sn - 1  ×  Sn - 1 and f is a [formula]-equivariant map. Thus the induced map

[formula]

is also [formula]-equivariant and [formula] act on the mapping cone M of [formula] with [formula] as its fixed point set. For n = 8 denote an element of Sn - 1 by (w1,w2) where w1 and w2 are quaternions. Let [formula] act on Sn - 1 by

[formula]

and act on Sn - 1  ×  Sn - 1 by

[formula]

Then [formula] acts freely on each factor of Sn - 1  ×  Sn - 1 and acts on Sn - 1 with fixed point set S5. Note that, f is [formula]-equivariant and hence the induced map [formula] is also [formula]-equivariant. Thus [formula] acts on the mapping cone M of [formula] and has the fixed point set [formula]. Note that f has bidegree (1,1) and hence [formula] has Hopf invariant 1. This shows [formula]. Let [formula] act freely on Sn - 1 and act on Sn with Sr as the fixed set for some even integer r. Then [formula] acts on [formula] with the fixed point set [formula], where s is an even integer and hence act on [formula] with the fixed point set [formula] or [formula] depending on the wedge sum. For the remaining case, we consider the [formula] action on [formula] with [formula] as its fixed point set, where both n and r are even. Let [formula] act freely on Sn - 1 and act on Sn with exactly two fixed points. Then it acts on [formula] with Xr as the fixed point set and hence acts on [formula] with the fixed point set [formula]. Alternatively, one can use Tomter [\cite=Tom], where a [formula] action has been constructed on the actual quaternionic projective space QP2 with the complex projective space [formula] as its fixed point set and do the above construction. For a  ≠  0, take [formula]. As above, we can construct [formula] actions on X with the desired fixed point sets.

Case(4) Suppose F has one component. Then either

[formula]

or

[formula]

As χ(F)  =  χ(X), for [formula] we must have either r, s and t all are even or exactly one of them is even. Similarly, for [formula] we must have either s and r both even or both odd. For a = 0, take [formula]. If n is even, we take [formula] actions on Sn, S2n and S3n having Sr, Ss and St respectively as fixed point sets, where r, s and t are all even. And if n is odd, we take actions where exactly one of them is even namely s. This gives an action on X with [formula] as the fixed point set, where the wedge is taken at some fixed points on the subspheres. For the other case take [formula], where [formula] and n is even. Consider the [formula] action on Sn with Ss as its fixed point set for some even s and the action on Y fixing P2(r) for some even r. This can be obtained by taking a free action on Sn - 1 and an action on P2(n) with P2(r) as the fixed point set. For example the [formula] action on [formula] with [formula] as its fixed point set (r is even) induces an action on [formula] with [formula] as its fixed point set or one can use [\cite=Tom] for n = 4 and r = 2. This gives a [formula] action on X with [formula]. For a  ≠  0, as above, we can construct an action on [formula] with [formula] for even integers r and s. In this case the fixed point set cannot be a wedge of three spheres. Now suppose that n is even and X is not totally non-homologous to zero in XG. Then by Proposition 3,

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

This gives χ(F) =  -1, 0, 1, 2 or 3. But Proposition 4 gives χ(F) = χ(X) = 4, a contradiction. This completes the proof of the theorem. [formula]

Proof of Theorem 2 and examples

Let X be not totally non-homologous to zero in XG. Then n is odd and χ(F) = χ(X) = 0. As above [formula] and hence χ(F) =  -1, 0, 1, 2 or 3. But χ(F) = 0 and therefore either F = φ or [formula], where 1  ≤  r  ≤  3n is an odd integer. Recall that when n is odd, we have a = 0. We now construct a [formula] action on S2  ×  Sn + 2 with S3 as its fixed point set, where n  ≥  3 is an odd integer [\cite=B2]. Let η be the Hopf 2-plane bundle over S2 and -  η be its inverse, that is [formula] = trivial 4-plane bundle. Let ε be the trivial (n - 1)-plane bundle over S2. Then [formula] is a (n + 1)-plane bundle (where n + 1 is even) admitting a fibre-wise orthogonal action of [formula] by bundle maps leaving the zero section fixed (which is the base space S2). Together with the trivial action of [formula] on η, this gives an action on the trivial (n + 3)-plane bundle

[formula]

whose fixed set is η. Taking the unit sphere bundles we get an action of [formula] on S2  ×  Sn + 2 with fixed point set S3 (which is the total space of the unit sphere bundle of η). Now, remove a fixed point from S2  ×  Sn + 2 to obtain a space [formula] with a [formula] action and contractible fixed point set. Let [formula] act trivially on Sn - 3 and consider the induced action on the join [formula] which is homotopically equivalent to [formula]. This action on W has a contractible fixed point set. For a given odd integer 1  ≤  r  ≤  3n, consider the [formula] action on S3n with Sr as its fixed point set. Then the wedge of W and S3n at a fixed point is a space [formula] and has a [formula] action with its fixed point set [formula]. [formula]

Remark. It is clear that there is no free [formula] action on [formula]. The author does not know of any free [formula] action on a space [formula]. In case it exists, it will be interesting to determine the cohomology ring of the orbit space, for which one can exploit the Leray spectral sequence associated to the Borel fibration [formula].
