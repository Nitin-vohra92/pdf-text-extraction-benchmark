Orbit projections of proper Lie groupoids as fibrations

[\cite=orb-fib] states that the orbit projection M  →  M / G of a proper G-manifold M is a fibration, i.e., has the homotopy lifting property, if and only if M is regular, i.e., each connected component of M has only one orbit type. We generalize this to proper Lie groupoids:

Consider a Lie groupoid [formula] with source map s and target map t. All manifolds in this note are assumed to be smooth, Hausdorff, paracompact, and finite dimensional. There exist interesting non-Hausdorff groupoids G, however, unlike convention we assume that all our groupoids G are Hausdorff. The Lie groupoid [formula] is said to be source locally trivial if the source map s:G  →  M makes G into a locally trivial fibration. For x∈M the set Ox: = {t(g):g∈s- 1(x)} is called orbit through x. Each orbit O is a regular immersed submanifold in M. It is called of finite type if there is a proper function [formula] with a finite number of critical points. The connected components of the orbits constitute the leaves of a singular foliation of M. The quotient M / G: = {Ox:x∈M} is called the orbit space of [formula]. The orbit projection M  →  M / G is the canonical mapping x  ↦  Ox. A Lie groupoid [formula] is called proper if (s,t):G  →  M  ×  M is a proper mapping. For proper Lie groupoids all orbits are closed submanifolds, the orbit space is Hausdorff and paracompact, and all isotropy groups [formula] are compact Lie groups. For any subset L  ⊆  M we denote by GL: = {g∈G:s(g),t(g)∈L} the restriction of G to L.

A typical example of a proper Lie groupoid is the action groupoid [formula] associated to a proper G-manifold M: It is the groupoid [formula] with s(g,x) = x and t(g,x) = g.x, where G  ×  M  →  M  ×  M,(g,x)  ↦  (x,g.x) is a proper mapping. The orbits and isotropy groups of [formula] coincide with the usual orbits and isotropy groups of the action G  ×  M  →  M.

The statement of [\cite=orb-fib] mentioned earlier is the content of the above theorem when restricted to proper action groupoids [formula]. The main ingredient in the proof of [\cite=orb-fib] is the slice theorem for proper actions due to Palais [\cite=palais]. Weinstein [\cite=weinstein] and Zung [\cite=zung] proved the following slice theorem for source locally trivial proper Lie groupoids [formula]: Let O be an orbit of finite type. Then there is an invariant neighborhood U of O in M such that the restriction GU of G to U is isomorphic to the restriction of [formula] to a tubular neighborhood of the zero section in NO. Here GO is a transitive Lie groupoid over O which acts linearly on the normal vector bundle NO: = TM / TO of O in M.

Let Σ be a slice at x∈O, i.e., a submanifold Σ  ⊆  M with [formula] and [formula]. The restriction [formula] is a proper Lie groupoid with fixed point x and, thus, it is locally isomorphic to the linear action groupoid [formula] (see [\cite=zung]). We call a source locally trivial proper Lie groupoid [formula] regular if, for every x∈M, the action Gx  ×  TxΣ  →  TxΣ is trivial.

Since M / G is paracompact, the projection π:M  →  M / G is a fibration if and only if it is a local fibration, i.e., each point in M / G has a neighborhood U such that π|π- 1(U):π- 1(U)  →  U is a fibration (e.g. [\cite=dugundji]).

Assume that π:M  →  M / G is a fibration. Let x∈M, O the orbit through x, and Σ a slice at x. The restriction [formula] is isomorphic to the restriction of the action groupoid [formula] to a neighborhood of zero, by [\cite=zung]. By source local triviality, the neighborhood can be chosen to be invariant (see [\cite=weinstein]). Since t is a submersion, t- 1(Σ) is a closed submanifold of G. Then the compact Lie group Gx acts on Σ and it acts freely on t- 1(Σ) (by left translations via the embedding of Gx into the group of bisections of [formula]). The submersion t|t- 1(Σ):t- 1(Σ)  →  Σ is Gx-equivariant. By [\cite=weinstein] (see also [\cite=weinstein]), there is a Gx-invariant neighborhood V of t- 1(x) in t- 1(Σ) and a Gx-equivariant retraction ρ:V  →  t- 1(x) such that (ρ,t|V):V  →  t- 1(x)  ×  Σ is a diffeomorphism (after possibly shrinking Σ). Putting U: = s(V), we obtain a retraction U  →  O. The mappings s|V:V  →  U and s|t- 1(x):t- 1(x)  →  O are principal bundles with structure group Gx (acting from the left).

[formula]

By assumption, π|U:U  →  U  /  GU is a fibration. We claim that also [formula] is a fibration. Let f:X  ×  {0}  →  Σ be continuous and let φ:X  ×  I  →  U  /  GU be a homotopy of [formula]. Since π|U:U  →  U  /  GU is a fibration, there exists a homotopy :X  ×  I  →  U of f covering φ. We may lift f to a mapping :X  ×  {0}  →  V, by setting [formula], with u:M  →  G the unit map which sends z to the identity arrow 1z at z. Since s|V:V  →  U is a fibration, there exists a homotopy :X  ×  I  →  V of [formula] covering [formula]. It follows that [formula] is a homotopy of f covering φ. Hence the claim is proved.

But [formula] is isomorphic to the restriction of the action groupoid [formula] (which is just a group action) to a neighborhood of zero, and so the fact that its orbit projection π|Σ is a fibration implies that x is a regular point (by [\cite=orb-fib]).

Suppose that [formula] is regular. Let x∈M and use the above terminology. Then the projection π|U:U  →  U  /  GU identifies with O  ×  Σ  →  Σ, which obviously is a fibration. So π:M  →  M / G is a local fibration and, thus, a fibration.
