DEFINING THE TERMINATION OF THE ASYMPTOTIC GIANT BRANCH

INTRODUCTION

The transition of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars to the early planetary nebula (PN) stage is a poorly understood phase of stellar evolution. It is agreed upon that a rapid drop in mass loss rate accompanies the transition from the AGB to the post-AGB phase. However, no well defined objective criterion exists for the transition from the AGB to the post-AGB phase (the termination of the AGB). Blöcker (1995), for example, used both mass loss rate and the stellar pulsation period, i.e., a dynamical property of the star. He took the mass loss rate to decrease with decreasing pulsating period, and defined the zero-age post-AGB phase when the pulsation period is 50 days. Below I will suggest a new property to theoretically define the transition from the AGB to the post-AGB phase. It is based on both the thermal and dynamical properties of the star, and is connected to the mass loss rate and mass loss inhomogeneities.

Observationally, AGB stars are well defined, and visible well developed post-AGB stars can be clearly defined in principle, but practically there are many difficulties (e.g., Hrivnak et al. 1989; Szczerba et al. 2007; Suarez et al. 2006). Still, there is no theoretical definition of the transition. Recently, Szczerba et al. (2007) classified many post-AGB stars. However, they classified mainly unobscured stars in the IR and/or the visible band, most likely well after they have left the AGB. Observationally, most stars are likely to be obscured during the transition because of a high mass loss rate. Several parameters were proposed to define the transition from the AGB to the post-AGB phase, but each one of them has some problems. A drop in the mass loss rate. This criterion (e.g., Suarez et al. 2006) captures the essence of the transition. However, what mass loss rate should be used to mark the transition? What if the star rotates and/or interacts with a binary companion such that mass loss rate depends on the companion? Optical depth. Suggestions have been made that the transition occurs when the totally obscured AGB star becomes visible again. But at what wavelength? Another problem with this definition is that it depends on the viewing angle if the mass loss geometry is not spherical. In addition, low mass AGB stars with low metallicity might never become totally obscured. Pulsation period. Although mass loss rate is tightly coupled to pulsation, it is not clear what pulsation period should be used. Also, AGB stars with different total masses and luminosity can have the same pulsation period at very different effective temperatures. The usage of pulsation (e.g., Blöcker 1995) includes in it the dynamical time of the star, but no 'natural' transition value exists. In the presently proposed criterion the dynamical time is included with a quantitative measure. A change in the dominating mass loss mechanism. On the AGB the mass loss process is that of pulsations coupled with radiation pressure on dust, while for the central stars of PNs it is mainly radiation pressure on ions. The idea is that the transition is defined when the dominate mass loss process switches from pulsation and radiation pressure on dust to radiation pressure on ions. There are two main problems with this. Firstly, the physics is not well understood to connect this transition to stellar evolutionary codes. Secondly, interaction with a companion can be the dominate mass loss mechanism in many post-AGB stars, either via tidal interaction or a common envelope. Effective temperature. It is not clear what temperature to use. There is no 'natural' temperature for any physical effect, although the transition occurs around an effective temperature of T≃5000  ~   (e.g. Schönberner 1981). Even dust formation can cease at different temperatures, depending on the metallicity of the envelope. Vassiliadis & Wood (1994) took the transition to occur when the effective temperature is twice the minimum temperature the star can reach on the AGB, but no physical reason is given for that. Contraction. Contraction cannot be used because the star starts to contract before it leaves the AGB. Rapid contraction. The criterion of a rapid contraction, with time or with decreasing envelope mass, captures the essence of the transition, but a quantitative value is not easy to define. One can use the logarithmic derivative of the stellar radius with envelope mass

[formula]

But δ changes monotonically in the relevant temperature (radius) range, and it is not clear what value should be used, although δ = 1 might be a natural choice (Frankowski, A. 2007, private communication). Alternatively, one can define the transition to occur when the magnitude of the second logarithmic derivative of the stellar radius with envelope mass

[formula]

reaches its maximum value. This occurs when the contraction changes from the AGB type behavior to the post-AGB one. Examining some models show that this occurs at an effective temperature of ~  7000 - 9000  ~  , which is hotter than the usually assumed transition point (Schönberner & Blöcker 1993), e.g., Szczerba et al. (2001) and Tylenda et al. (2001) who listed G and K stars as post AGB stars. The criterion proposed in the next section includes in it the beginning of the rapid contraction with envelope mass, and does it with a quantitative physical definition. In any case, it seems that the criterion of maximum C is similar in some aspects to the criterion suggested in the next section (but not the quantitative value of transition). Topology in the U - V plane. One defines the quantities [formula] and [formula], where Mr is the mass inner to radius r in the star, and the other symbols have their usual meaning. One can draw the structure of the star in the U - V plane. As discussed in detailed by Sugimoto & Fujimoto (2000), a structural curve with a loop corresponds to a giant-like structure, while that without a loop corresponds to a dwarf-like structure. Equivalently, one can consider the variation of [formula] within the star. If it changes (inside the star) monotonically then there is no loop. We can try to apply this criterion to the post AGB star. For a very low envelope mass Mr is constant in the envelope, and W = GM2r / 4πr4P  ~  (r4P)- 1. I examine the structure of the model with the envelope mass of 5.74  ×  10- 4 from Soker (1992), that has an effective temperature of 7200K. The envelope pressure profile changes from P  ~  r- 5 in the range [formula] to P  ~  r- 3.7 in the range [formula]. Namely, W increases with r for [formula], and decreases with increasing r in the range [formula]. A loop in the U - V plane does exist for this model. Therefore, the loop in the U - V plane disappears too late in the post AGB evolution. An interesting property is that V and U are related to dynamical and thermal properties of the envelope, however, it is not straightforward to connect them to relevant properties of the post-AGB envelope. Disappearance of the envelope convective zone. Although the convective zone becomes thinner and thinner as the star shrinks, it disappear only when the star is very hot (e.g., Soker 1992). End of shell burning. This criterion has not been suggested, but it is listed here for the sake of clarity. It is not a good criterion as nuclear burning ceases when the star is hot (e.g. Harpaz & Kovetz 1981; Kovetz & Harpaz 1981; Schönberner 1981).

THE PROPOSED CRITERION

When the envelope mass is low, the Kelvin-Helmholtz time of the envelope is given by (Schönberner & Blöcker 1993)

[formula]

where Mc is the core mass, L is the stellar luminosity, R is the stellar radius, and ρ is the density in the envelope. On the upper AGB the density profile in most of the envelope (beside regions very close to the core that contain very little mass) can be approximated by [formula] (e.g., Soker 1992). For the inner radius of the envelope, and in particular for the convective part, we can take [formula], and so βs  =   ln (R / r0)≃6 in the integration of equation ([\ref=tkh1]). I defined a parameter βs that depends on the exact structure of the envelope. For the response of the envelope alone, the internal energy of the envelope should also be considered. This will reduce the required time to supply energy or to remove energy, and will reduce somewhat the effective value of βs. I will therefore scale it with βs = 5. Scaling the different variables of upper AGB stars gives

[formula]

where Menv is the envelope mass.

For the relevant dynamical time I take (Gρav)- 1 / 2, where ρav is the average density of the entire star. Scaling with typical number gives

[formula]

During the evolution along the AGB before the star starts to contract in radius, the luminosity increases and the mass decreases, such that τdyn increases and τKH - env decreases. Therefore, their ratio [formula] increases. For evaluating the value of Q on the upper AGB, when the envelope mass is low, I take Mc = M in equation ([\ref=tkh2]). This gives for the upper AGB

[formula]

The thermal time τKH - env is less than an order of magnitude longer than the dynamical time during this late AGB phase. Soker & Harpaz (1999) noted that this relatively short thermal time must result in a strong irregular behavior of the envelope because dynamical motions, such as pulsations and convective motion, can cause large thermal perturbations in the envelope. Therefore, a large value of this parameter, i.e., [formula], can be related to a highly inhomogeneous mass loss process, as well as to a high mass loss rate. Soker & Harpaz (1992) argued that the characteristics of AGB stellar pulsations depend on the thermal and dynamical time scales. They used the thermal time scale of only the upper envelope, and for the dynamical time scale they took the pulsation period.

The star starts to contract before it leaves the AGB. The initial contraction is slow, and the stellar radius during the early contraction phase can be approximated by

[formula]

where Rm and Menv - m are the stellar radius and envelope mass when the contraction starts. For the model used by Soker (1992) relation ([\ref=rad1]) holds for an envelope mass of [formula] with δ≃0.2 for most of the time. Then δ increases more and more rapidly until it reaches a very large value when the star contracts by two order of magnitude for a tiny change in the envelope mass (Schönberner 1983). Qualitatively similar behavior is found for other core masses, but at different envelope masses (Schönberner 1983; Frankowski 2003). Using equation ([\ref=rad1]) to express the stellar radius in equation ([\ref=chi1]) gives for the contracting-AGB phase

[formula]

During the contracting-AGB phase the luminosity and mass do not change much, and the derivative of equation ([\ref=chi2]) can be written as

[formula]

Along the entire AGB ΔQ is negative (beside temporal variations, e.g., after thermal pulses). It is very positive during the fast contraction along the post-AGB track (again, beside temporal variations). The transition from ΔQ < 0 to ΔQ > 0 can mark the beginning of the post-AGB phase. (Note that the envelope mass decreases with time, and therefore when ΔQ < 0 then Q increases with time.) Namely, the star is said to terminate the AGB when Q is at its maximum value; this occurs after the contraction started and Q = QC.

If there is no change in the density profile then d ln βs / d ln Menv  =  0 and ΔQC changes sign when δ  =  0.4. This is when more or less the rapid contraction starts. However, during the contracting-AGB phase the density profile becomes steeper (e.g., Soker 1992), and βs increases slowly, so that d ln βs / d ln Menv  <  0. On the other hand, the envelope convective zone, which might be more relevant to many processes influencing the mass loss process, becomes concentrated in the outer region and the effective value of βs might decrease. Over all, I suggest to ignore the structural factor βs, and to mark the transition when δ  =  0.4, i.e., when d ln (RC) / d ln Menv  =  0.4 and ΔQ = 0.

Alternatively we can use the criterion that

[formula]

is equal zero. Namely, τKH - env has its minimum value. This occurs when δ≃1.

In the model presented in Soker (1992) δ  =  2 / 5 and δ  =  1 when the stellar radius is [formula] and [formula], and the effective temperature is T = 4400 ~  and T = 5100 ~ , respectively. The value of C defined in equation ([\ref=C1]) reaches its maximum at T≃7000  ~  . In a model with a core mass of [formula] from the solar metallicity track of Vassiliadis & Wood (1994), the maxima in Q and QKH as calculated by Frankowski (Frankowski, A. 2007, private communication) are reached when the stellar radius is [formula] and [formula], and at an effective temperature of T = 5200 ~  and T  =  6100  ~  , respectively. The value of C has its maximum at a temperature of T  =  8900  ~   in that model. As mentioned in section 1, the C-criterion gives the transition at a too high temperature, after mass loss has decline, but still captures most aspects of the transition. I prefer the Q-criterion or the QKH-criterion because they seem to have more of a physical implication to the mass loss process.

SUMMARY

I suggest to theoretically define the transition from the AGB to the post-AGB phase, namely, the termination of the AGB, by using the envelope thermal time scale (Kelvin-Helmholtz time) and the stellar dynamical time. The criterion does not refer to the short time-scale variations occurring on the AGB and post-AGB, e.g., thermal pulses (helium shell flashes) and magnetic activity, but refers to the time average of stellar properties. All other alternatives for the transition must use average values as well; only a criterion based on the envelope mass alone does not need a time average, but no such a criterion has been suggested.

As the star expands along the AGB and loses mass the thermal time scale decreases and the dynamical time increase. On the upper AGB the two time scales become comparable. This implies that dynamical processes, such as pulsation and convective motion, can influence the thermal state of the envelope. This is likely to influence the mass loss process. The thermal time scale continues to decrease even after the star starts its contraction. The thermal time scale starts to increase at about the same evolutionary point where the rapid contraction starts.

I suggest to define the termination of the AGB when Q (defined in eq. [\ref=chi1]) reaches it maximum value. This occurs during the contraction part of the AGB, when Q = QC (eq. [\ref=chi2]), and the transition occurs when ΔQC = 0 (defined in eq. [\ref=chi3]). Alternatively, using only the thermal time scale, the transition can be defined when the thermal time scale starts to increase with decreasing envelope mass. Namely, when the value of τKH - env is at its minimum and ΔQKH = 0 (eq. [\ref=chi4]).

The criterion proposed here has several advantages.

It uses well defined properties of the envelope. These are simple to derive with a stellar model calculated without the inclusion of pulsation or magnetic activity. If these are included, time average must be introduced.

The transition can be defined to occur at a well define evolutionary point (when averaged over short time scales variations), when ΔQ = 0 (or, alternatively, ΔQKH = 0).

It is based on properties that are closely related to the mass loss process: The dynamical time and the thermal properties of the envelope. However, the theoretical transition occurs when Q is at its maximum value. Therefore, the high mass loss rate and inhomogeneities are likely to continue into the post-AGB phase for a short time.

It contains previously proposed criteria. (a) Pulsation: via the dynamical time scale. (b) Rapid contraction: as the change in the behavior of τKH  -  env occurs at about the same time rapid contraction stars. (c) Mass loss rate: The mass loss process is related to the dynamical and thermal time scales. (d) Effective temperature: The value ΔQ = 0 is reached at T  ~  4000 - 6000  ~  , a temperatures range that was used before to mark the zero age pos-AGB phase.

Although the criterion proposed here has its own merit in the theoretical study of stellar evolution, it goes beyond a pure academic exercise. The criterion suggests that the involved time scales have a role in determining the evolution of the envelope, mainly as they are important parameters in the mass loss process, e.g., via pulsation properties. Future theoretical studies will have to examine in more detail how these time scales affect the mass loss process. Also, the suggested theoretical criterion must be examined with detailed numerical simulations, to verify that the criterion ΔQ = 0, or ΔQKH = 0, do not give wrong results. The numerical study should also determine which of these two similar criteria fit observational parameters better, hence connecting theoretical studies with observations.
