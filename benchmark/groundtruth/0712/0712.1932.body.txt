A direct and simple proof of Jacobi identities for determinants

Introduction

Let [formula] be a n-order matrix. Denoted by [formula] the cofactor (algebraic cofactor) of the matrix entry aij . The cofactor (algebraic cofactor) of the minor determinant [formula] is denoted by [formula], then the following Jacobi identities [\cite=Tak] [\cite=Hir] are valid. Though the Jacobi identities have been proved in [\cite=Tak], as the author in [\cite=Hir] said, looking at the proof of the general case, it is difficult to understand the Jacobi identities immediately and the author himself came to understand the result by checking the formulae using computer algebra, looking for an alternative proof and applying it to actual problems. Here we will present a direct proof for the Jacobi identities using the famous Pl[formula]cker relations for determinants.

Pl[formula]cker relations

In this section, let's state the Pl[formula]cker relations for determinants.

Let M be a n  ×  (n - r) matrix and [formula] 2r n-order column vectors, then where [formula] is a permutation of [formula] and σ is the permutation with [formula] and [formula].

Firstly, it is obvious that

[formula]

On the other hand, by the classical Laplace expansion for determinants, it can be obtained that

[formula]

Comparing the above two equations, we have

[formula]

where [formula] is a permutation of [formula] and σ is the permutation with [formula] and [formula].

Let M be a n  ×  (n - 2) matrix and a,  b,  c and d four n-order column vectors , then

[formula]

The above equation [\eqref=205] is the simplest case of the Pl[formula]cker relations [\cite=Hir] which plays an important role in nonlinear dynamics and soliton theory due to Sato's theorem [\cite=Sat] [\cite=OST]. It shows that many of the differential and difference equations in mathematical physics are merely disguised versions of the Pl[formula]cker relations. For example, Sato [\cite=Sat] [\cite=OST] first discovered that the KP equation in bilinear form was nothing but a Pl[formula]cker relation, where the Hirota's bilinear operators Dt,  Dx and Dy are defined by

[formula]

The other forms of Pl[formula]cker relations have been widely applied to algebraic geometry. For example, a projective embedding of the Grassmann variety Gr(p, n) can be defined by the quadratic polynomial equations called "the Pl[formula]cker relations" (to see [\cite=KPRS] and its references).

The Pl[formula]cker relations are also exactly relational to the Maya diagrams and Young diagrams [\cite=Hir]. It makes them play a primary role in Combinatorics, Lie theory and Representation Theory (to see [\cite=Kle] [\cite=IWa] and their references).

Jacobi identities for determinants

Let [formula] be a n-order matrix. Denoted by Mi  jk  l the cofactor of the minor determinant [formula], then

It is no less of generality to consider the case of i < j and k < l < s < r. Denoted by M the (n - 2)  ×  (n - 4) submatrix obtained by eliminating the i-th and j-th rows and the k-th, l-th, s-th and r-th columns from A. The four (n - 2)-order column vectors obtained by eliminating the i-th and j-th components from the k-th, l-th, s-th and r-th column vectors in A are denoted by a,  b,  c and d respectively. Then it is easy to see that

[formula]

Consequently, by employing the Pl[formula]cker relation [\eqref=205], one has

[formula]

Note that only the indices are important in the equation [\eqref=301], so it can also be expressed as

[formula]

which is nothing but a Pl[formula]cker relation.

Let [formula] be a n-order matrix. Denoted by [formula] the cofactor of the minor determinant [formula]. Choosing r rows and 2r columns from A, the according row and column indices are denoted by [formula] and [formula] respectively. It might as well set that [formula] and [formula]. Then where [formula] is a permutation of [formula] and σ is the permutation with [formula] and [formula].

It is completely similar to the proof of the above theorem [\ref=thm3-01] by employing the equation [\eqref=201]. So here we omit it.

Let [formula] be a n-order matrix. Denoted by Mij the cofactor of the matrix entry aij in A. The cofactor of the minor determinant [formula] is denoted by Mi  jk  l, then

It is no less generality to condider the special case with i = 1 and j = 2. Firstly, it is easy to see that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

On the other hand, by the equation [\eqref=301], it can be obtained that

[formula]

Therefore, by employing the Laplace expasion for determinants, one has

[formula]

The Jacobi identities play an important role in soliton theory. For example [\cite=Hir], if the solutions to the KP equation or the Toda lattice equation are expressed as Grammian determinants, their bilinear equations are nothing but the Jacobi identities.

Let [formula] be a 2n-order antisymmetric matrix, then det A is equal to a perfect square of a polynomial of its matrix entries aij  (1  ≤  i,  j  ≤  n).

Following the above symbols, it is obvious that M11 = M22 = 0 and M12 =  - M21. Hence using the Jacobi identities, it can be obtained that

Note that det A = a212 when n = 1, and M1  21  2 is the determinant of a 2(n - 1)-order antisymmetric matrix. Therefore, it can be deduced that det A is a perfect square of a polynomial of aij  (1  ≤  i,  j  ≤  n) by the recurrence relation [\eqref=307].

Recalling the definition of a Pfaffian, the square of a n-order Pfaffian is equal to the determinant of a 2n-order antisymmetric matrix. The above corollary in a sense ensures that a Pfaffian is well defined. On the other hand, by the Pfaffian expression for determinants, the terms of Jacobi identities [\eqref=305] can be expressed as

[formula]

where the Pfaffian entries are defined by (i,  j) = (i*,  j*) = 0,  (i,  j*) =  - (j*,  i) = aij. Another proof of the Pfaffian version of Jacobi identities can also be found in [\cite=IWa]. Since the Jacobi identities are exactly relational to the structrue of solutions for soliton equations, the Pfaffian should also be. In fact, recently, many scholars [\cite=KNH] [\cite=GNT] [\cite=HZT] [\cite=GiNi] [\cite=LiO] [\cite=LHZ] have committed themselves to this domain.
