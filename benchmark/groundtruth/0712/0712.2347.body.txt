Virtual Bridge Number One Knots

Introduction into Virtual Knots

The Virtual Knot Theory was introduced by L. Kauffman [\cite=Kauffman]. Let us recall some of its basic notions.

A knot is a smooth embedding [formula]. It can be described by its knot diagram which is a generic immersion of S1 into the [formula]-plane equipped with information about over-passes and under-passes at double points. A knot diagram D gives rise to a Gauss diagram GD that is a circle parameterizing the knot with each pair of preimages of double points of D connected by an oriented signed chord. The chords are oriented from the preimage point on the over-passing branch to the preimage point on the under-passing branch. The sign of a chord is the sign of the corresponding double point. The resulting Gauss diagram GD is called the Gauss diagram of the knot diagram D.

Gauss diagrams that are obtainable as Gauss diagrams of some knot diagrams are said to be realizable. A knot diagram corresponding to a realizable Gauss diagram can be recovered only up to a certain ambiguity. However the isotopy type of the corresponding knot is recoverable in a unique way.

It is well-known that two knots described by their knot diagrams are isotopic if and only if one can change one diagram to another by a sequence of ambient isotopies of the diagram and of Reidemeister moves shown in Figure [\ref=Redemeister.fig].

The Redemeister moves can be easily encoded [\cite=GPV] in the language of Gauss diagrams, see Figure [\ref=GaussRedemeister.fig]. The equivalence classes of the, not necessarily realizable, Gauss diagrams modulo the resulting moves are called virtual knots.

Main results

Note that any two knots in [formula] are homotopic as loops. However there are many different homotopy classes of virtual knots. In particular not every virtual knot is homotopic to the unknot.

It is well-known that there are no ordinary knots K with b(K) = 1. However, as we show, the theory of virtual knots with [formula] is surprisingly nontrivial.

For every [formula] there exists a virtual knot Ki homotopic to the unknot that has [formula] and [formula]

The following Theorem can be thought of a generalization of the above result to the case of virtual knots that are not homotopic to the unknot.

There are infinitely many virtual knot homotopy classes Hp,q enumerated by pairs of distinct positive integers (p,q) such that Hp,q contains infinitely many distinct virtual knots {Kp,qj}∞j = 0 with [formula] and [formula] for all j1,j2.

Note that for a virtual knot homotopy class not containing the unknot, there is no obvious choice of the most trivial knot in the class. In the examples constructed in the proof of Theorem [\ref=main2] the knots Kp,q0 are simpler than all Kp,qj,j  ≥  1. So one can think of them as the chosen most trivial knots in the corresponding virtual homotopy classes.

Proofs

In the proofs of Theorems [\ref=main1] and [\ref=main2] we use properties of invariants studied by V. Turaev [\cite=Turaev] [\cite=Turaevcobordism] and A. Henrich [\cite=Henrich].

Invariants of V. Turaev and A. Henrich

It is easy to see that a flip move on a chord c with i(c)  ≠  0 changes one of the coefficients of the polynomial P invariant by 2. The flip move on a chord c with i(c) = 0 does not change the P invariant. Thus, as it was observed by A. Henrich [\cite=Henrich], if K1,K2 are homotopic virtual knots and [formula], then every (generic) homotopy between K1 and K2 involves at least [formula] flip moves. Thus [formula]

Let K be a virtual knot homotopic to the trivial knot K0. Let [formula]. Since P(K0) = 0, the above relation of the P invariant with the relative unknotting number [formula] implies that the vitual unknotting number [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main1]

Consider the virtual knots {Ki}∞i = 0 depicted in Figure [\ref=bridgefigureone.fig]. All these knots are virtually homotopic. Indeed to get from Ki + 1 to Ki perform a flip move on the chord in Ki + 1 with the rightmost arrow head. Then use the Gauss diagram version of the second Reidemeister move, see Figure [\ref=GaussRedemeister.fig], to cancel the resulting chord and the chord with the left most arrow head in Ki + 1. Since K0 is the trivial knot, we see that [formula] for all [formula]

A straightforward computation shows that [formula] As it was discussed in Remark [\ref=PRemark] this means that [formula] Hence [formula]

It is easy to see that [formula] for i  ≥  1. Since P(Ki)  ≠  0 for i  ≥  1, these virtual knots are nontrivial and hence [formula] for all i  ≥  1.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main2]

For [formula] with p  ≠  q we put Kp,q0 to be the virtual knot shown in Figure [\ref=bridgefiguretwo.fig] whose Gauss diagram consists of p parallel positive vertical chords oriented upwards and q parallel positive horizontal chords oriented to the right. A straightforward computation shows that u(Kp,q0) =  - ptq + qtp. Since u is invariant under virtual homotopy we see that if [formula] are such p1  ≠  q1, p2  ≠  q2 and (p1,q1)  ≠  (p2,q2), then Kp1,q10 and Kp2,q20 are not virtually homotopic.

If we draw the horizontal and vertical arrows of Kp,q0 to be close to the x- and y-axis, then we have four large arcs of the circle in Kp,q0 that are free of chord ends. We will refer to these arcs as the arcs located in the corresponding four quadrants. For [formula] put Kp,qn to be the virtual knot whose Gauss diagram is obtained from the diagram of Kp,q0 by adding 2n positive chords that pass through the circle center. The first n of the added chords should start in the fourth quadrant arc, end in the second quadrant arc and have almost vertical slope. The other n chords should start in the second quadrant arc, end in the fourth quadrant arc and have almost horizontal slope, see Figure [\ref=bridgefigurethree.fig].

We claim that for fixed p,q all the knots Kp,qn are virtually homotopic. For n  ≥  1 the homotopy between Kp,qn and Kp,qn - 1 is constructed as follows. Take the chord from the group of n chords going from the second to the fourth quadrant arc whose slope is the farthest from the horizontal one and perform the flip move on it. Use the Gauss diagram version of the second Reidemiester move to cancel the resulting chord and the chord in the group of n chords going from the fourth into the second quadrant arc whose slop is the farthest from the vertical, see Figure [\ref=bridgefigurefour.fig]. Since this virtual homotopy between Kp,qn and Kp,qn - 1 involves only one flip move, we have [formula] for all n1,n2.

A straightforward computation shows that

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Hence by Remark [\ref=PRemark], [formula] Thus we have [formula]

It is easy to see that [formula] Since P(Kp,qn)  ≠  0, these knots are nontrivial and we have [formula] .
