Invariant properties for finding distance in space of elasticity tensors

Introduction

Computing distance between elasticity tensors is particularly important in inverse problems. For instance, we wish to know whether or not a material can be considered as isotropic with its anisotropic behavior accounted for by the errors of inversion, which stem from both measurement errors and the fact that the elasticity tensor itself is an idealization in the realm of continuum mechanics.

A great portion of seismology, which is the motivation for our study, is performed under the assumption of isotropy due to its sufficient accuracy and mathematical convenience. However, to increase this accuracy, several seismologists formulated their equations without assuming isotropy; notably, Rudzki [\cite=Rudzki1] [\cite=Rudzki2] and, almost half a century later, Helbig [\cite=Helbig1956]. Three decades after Helbig, Thomsen [\cite=Thomsen] popularized the concept of anisotropy among exploration seismologists by formulating a linear approximation whose accuracy stems from the fact that most natural phenomena investigated in seismology are only weakly anisotropic.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the concept of distance in the space of elasticity tensors between a given tensor and classes of tensors exhibiting particular material symmetries, and to obtain the effective elasticity parameters and effective orientations for such symmetries. To facilitate this nonlinear process, we propose the use of invariants of the orthogonal projections onto various symmetry classes of elasticity tensors.

The concept of distance of a given elasticity tensor to a material-symmetry class was introduced by Gazis et al. [\cite=Gazis] using orthogonal projections of elasticity tensors on the space of a particular class, and by Fedorov [\cite=Fedorov], who minimized the mean-square difference of the slowness surface. Three decades later, Norris [\cite=Norris06] proved that the two approaches are equivalent to one another. Moakher and Norris [\cite=Moakher] give a detailed presentation of distance of an elasticity tensor to all material-symmetry classes. In this work, we use the Euclidean distance, which is induced by the Frobenius norm. For different distances with a detailed discussion of their properties we refer the reader to Moakher [\cite=Moakher02] and Moakher and Norris [\cite=Moakher].

In all approaches, the problem raised by Gazis et al. [\cite=Gazis] remains open: the orthogonal projection, csym, of a given elasticity tensor, c, onto the set of elasticity tensors belonging to a particular material symmetry class, Sym, depends on the original orientation of tensor c. It follows that the distance, [formula], between an elasticity tensor and its orthogonal projection depends on the a priori orientation of tensor c. Therefore, the distance, [formula], between an elasticity tensor, c, and some symmetry class, Sym, can be obtained by finding the orientation of elasticity tensor c that minimizes the distance [formula]. There have been several attempts to solve this problem. Gazis et al. [\cite=Gazis] give necessary conditions for the cubic case, such that the axes of a coordinate system coincide with the axes of its closest cubic tensor. Arts et al. [\cite=Arts] propose a method to find particular reference axes in which most offdiagonal terms are minimized. Dellinger [\cite=Dellinger05] proposes a numerical method to find the rotation-symmetry axis that minimizes the expression for distance to transverse isotropy. Fran�ois et al. [\cite=Francois98] and Norris [\cite=Norris06] propose numerical methods to find the closest projection.

We begin this paper by invoking the elasticity tensor together with the corresponding Voigt and dilatation tensors. We view elasticity tensors as fourth-rank tensors in [formula] and consequently look for invariant properties under the action of orthogonal group [formula]. This point of view was introduced and investigated independently by Walpole [\cite=Walpole], Rychlewski [\cite=Rychlewski84] [\cite=Rychlewski95], and Cowin and Mehrabadi [\cite=Cowin_Mehrabadi] [\cite=Cowin92].

For a fixed orthonormal basis in [formula], any other orthonormal basis can be given in terms of an orthogonal transformation A∈O(3). The orthogonal projection, csym(A), of an elasticity tensor, c, to a symmetry class, Sym, depends on the orientation, A, that is used to express the elasticity tensor. These orthogonal projections were considered first by Gazis et al. [\cite=Gazis], and explicitly obtained by Moakher and Norris [\cite=Moakher] for all symmetry classes. The corresponding Euclidian distance, [formula], between an elasticity tensor, c, and its orthogonal projection, csym(A), may not represent the distance to a symmetry class, [formula], since [formula]. Therefore, we obtain the distance to a given symmetry class by minimizing [formula], for A∈O(3). To facilitate this minimization, we express [formula] as function [formula], where λsymα(A) are the eigenvalues of the orthogonal projection csym(A).

In this work we prove that the traces of the associated Voigt and dilatation tensors, which are orthogonal invariants, also remain invariant under these orthogonal projections, and therefore certain relations between eigenvalues are preserved. These invariant relations are useful in simplifying function [formula]. Since the minimizing process is taken over the compact group O(3), the minimum is reached for an orthogonal transformation, Ae, which will be called the effective transformation or orientation. This allows us to obtain the distance of a given elasticity tensor to a particular symmetry class, and to find the orientation and eigenvalues - the effective elasticity parameters - of the closest elasticity tensor that belongs to that class. We discuss explicitly distance to isotropy, cubic symmetry and transverse isotropy, and provide numerical examples for our algorithms.

For the case of isotropy, we show that the orthogonal projection proposed by Moakher and Norris [\cite=Moakher] can also be obtained using the harmonic decomposition of an elasticity tensor, studied by Backus [\cite=Backus] and Cowin [\cite=Cowin]. In the case of isotropy, the orthogonal projection, c  ↦  ciso, is invariant under the action of the orthogonal group. Consequently, the eigenvalues of the isotropic projection are orthogonal invariants and therefore they can be referred to as the effective isotropic invariants. It implies that [formula] is constant. Therefore any orientation is an effective orientation, [formula], and no minimization algorithm is required. We express this distance in terms of the effective isotropic parameters, as well as in terms of traces of Voigt and dilatation tensors for the isotropic projection.

For the case of cubic symmetry, we use the orthogonal projection proposed by Gazis et al. [\cite=Gazis] and by Moakher and Norris [\cite=Moakher]. For an arbitrary orientation, A, of an elasticity tensor, c, its orthogonal projection, ccube(A), has three distinct eigenvalues, λcube1(A), λcube2(A), λcube3(A), with multiplicities 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The invariance of the traces of the Voigt and dilatation tensors under orthogonal projection, c  ↦  ccube, implies that the first eigenvalue of the cubic projection is an orthogonal invariant and the other two eigenvalues satisfy a linear relation, which is also an orthogonal invariant. Therefore, the distance, [formula], can be expressed as a function of one eigenvalue only, [formula], which the minimizing algorithm has to take into account to obtain distance [formula]

For the case of transverse isotropy, we use the orthogonal projection proposed by Moakher and Norris [\cite=Moakher]. For an arbitrary orientation A of an elasticity tensor, c, its orthogonal projection, cTI(A), has four distinct eigenvalues, λTI1(A), λTI2(A), λTI3(A), λTI4(A), with multiplicities 1, 1, 2 and 2, respectively. The invariance of the trace of Voigt tensor under the orthogonal projection c  ↦  cTI implies a linear relation among the four eigenvalues of the transversely isotropic projection. Therefore, the distance, [formula], can be expressed as a function of three eigenvalues only, [formula], which the minimizing algorithm has to take into account to obtain distance [formula]

At the end of the paper, we illustrate the presented approach using examples of strongly and weakly anisotropic solids. For these examples, the algorithm provides the distances to isotropic, cubic and transverse isotropic symmetry, as well as the effective orientation and effective elasticity parameters for each of the considered symmetry classes.

Elasticity tensor

In this section, we present the notions that allow us to formulate and discuss distance between a given elasticity tensor and material-symmetry classes.

The elasticity tensor is a fourth-rank tensor in [formula], which according to Hooke's law relates the stress and strain tensors,

[formula]

In this paper, Roman indices, [formula], run from one to three, and Greek indices, [formula], from one to six; summation over repeated indices is implied. Both stress and strain are symmetric second-rank tensors in [formula]. We denote the space of second-rank symmetric tensors in [formula] by [formula]; this is a six-dimensional linear space in which we consider the scalar product given by

[formula]

where [formula] stands for trace and t for transpose. Therefore, one can view an elasticity tensor as a linear map [formula] that is symmetric,

[formula]

and positive-definite,

[formula]

Since c is a fourth-rank tensor in [formula], its components with respect to orthonormal basis [formula] are

[formula]

which satisfy the intrinsic symmetries given by cijkl = cjikl = cklij. For subsequent use, we invoke the Voigt and dilatation tensors, which are second-rank symmetric tensors in [formula], given by

[formula]

and discussed by Cowin and Mehrabadi [\cite=Cowin_Mehrabadi] and Helbig [\cite=Helbig].

Let us consider the group of orthogonal transformations, [formula], in the three-dimensional Euclidean space, [formula]. Each such transformation is linear and preserves the scalar product. For a fixed orthonormal basis [formula] in [formula], any other orthonormal basis B' = {f1,f2,f3} can be identified with an orthogonal transformation A∈O(3), such that Aei = fi, for all i∈{1,2,3}. Also, we will refer to orthogonal transformation A as an orthonormal basis.

An orthogonal transformation [formula] acts on a second-rank symmetric tensor, [formula], as

[formula]

An orthogonal transformation [formula] acts on the elasticity tensor as

[formula]

For the orthonormal basis [formula], the components of [formula] are

[formula]

We remark here that these are also the components of elasticity tensor c with respect to the orthonormal basis A.

The orthonormal basis [formula] of [formula] induces an orthonormal basis of [formula], given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

with [formula] and δij being the Kronecker delta. The components [formula] of a second-rank symmetric tensor with respect to the orthonormal basis [formula] of [formula] can be arranged into a six-dimensional vector,

[formula]

with respect to basis [\eqref=eq:ortogonal_omega]. Since Lord Kelvin [\cite=Kelvin] [\cite=Kelvin:Vol3] suggested such an approach -- albeit without using the tensorial notation, which was not known at the time - we refer to entities expressed with respect to basis [\eqref=eq:ortogonal_omega] as Kelvin's notation. An elasticity tensor, which is a second-rank positive-definite symmetric tensor in [formula], has the components with respect to basis [\eqref=eq:ortogonal_omega] given by

[formula]

Cαβ are the entries of a [formula] matrix, which we write explicitly as

[formula]

This formulation was introduced and investigated independently by Walpole [\cite=Walpole], Rychlewski [\cite=Rychlewski84] [\cite=Rychlewski95], and Cowin and Mehrabadi [\cite=Cowin_Mehrabadi] [\cite=Cowin92]. We refer to matrix [\eqref=eq:Chapman], as Kelvin's notation [\cite=Kelvin:Vol3]. This notation has been used by several researchers; notably, Fedorov [\cite=Fedorov], Helbig [\cite=Helbig], Chapman [\cite=Chapman] and B�na et al. [\cite=BBS1].

For subsequent use, we invoke the scalar product given by

[formula]

which results in the Frobenius norm given by

[formula]

We remark here that Kelvin's notation is essential for the second equality in both expressions [\eqref=eq:scalar_el] and [\eqref=eq:norm_el].

The elasticity tensor's eigenvalues are positive real numbers due to its symmetry and positive definiteness. We denote these eigenvalues by [formula] and their multiplicities by [formula], where [formula]. The norm of the elasticity tensor can be expressed in terms of eigenvalues as

[formula]

Scalar product [\eqref=eq:scalar_el] and Frobenius norm [\eqref=eq:norm_el] are invariant under the action of orthogonal group [formula].

Distance to isotropy

The harmonic decomposition of an elasticity tensor, which results in its isotropic and anisotropic parts, has been used by several researchers, notably Backus [\cite=Backus], Cowin [\cite=Cowin] and Baerheim [\cite=Baerheim], to study properties of this tensor. Using this decomposition, we show that, for an arbitrary elasticity tensor, the isotropic part is its closest isotropic tensor, in the Euclidean sense. The norm of the anisotropic part, which is the component orthogonal to the isotropic one, is the distance between an arbitrary elasticity tensor and the class of isotropic tensors, as discussed by Gazis et al. [\cite=Gazis], Fedorov [\cite=Fedorov] and, recently, by Moakher and Norris [\cite=Moakher]. Combining these results, we discuss the distance to isotropy using traces of the Voigt and dilatation tensors, the Lam� parameters, as well as the two distinct eigenvalues of the closest isotropic tensor. We show that these eigenvalues are the effective isotropic parameters introduced by Voigt [\cite=Voigt] and discussed by Cowin [\cite=Cowin]. Therefore, the distance of an elasticity tensor to isotropy measures the deviation of its eigenvalues from its effective isotropic parameters.

To derive and discuss the expression for distance, we consider an elasticity tensor whose components with respect to a fixed orthonormal basis, [formula], are cijkl. In terms of these components we consider the following parameters introduced by Backus [\cite=Backus] and Cowin [\cite=Cowin] for the harmonic decomposition of the elasticity tensor:

[formula]

The first parameter is related to the parameters obtained by Moakher and Norris [\cite=Moakher] by λ = k - 2μ / 3; the second one is the same as the parameter obtained by Moakher and Norris [\cite=Moakher]. Using definitions [\eqref=eq:Voigt], we express λ and μ in terms of traces of the Voigt and dilatation tensors,

[formula]

which shows that these parameters are invariants under the action of the orthogonal group O(3).

According to Gazis et al. [\cite=Gazis], it follows that tensor

[formula]

is positive-definite, and therefore one can view λ and μ as the Lam� parameters of this isotropic tensor. Tensor ciso has two distinct eigenvalues, namely,

[formula]

and

[formula]

with multiplicities m1 = 1 and m2 = 5. These two eigenvalues coincide with the two effective isotropic moduli used by Voigt [\cite=Voigt] and Cowin [\cite=Cowin].

By a straightforward calculation we can show that [formula] and hence [formula]. In view of this orthogonality, we denote

[formula]

which implies that

[formula]

Therefore, the square of the distance between an arbitrary elasticity tensor and its orthogonal projection is

[formula]

From expressions [\eqref=eq:lambda1] and [\eqref=eq:lambda2] as well as matrix [\eqref=eq:c_iso], it follows that the orthogonal projection c  ↦  ciso is invariant under the action of the orthogonal group O(3). Therefore, no minimization is necessary to obtain the distance to isotropy, and hence

[formula]

It follows that tensor [\eqref=eq:c_iso] is the closest isotropic tensor to a given elasticity tensor. Distance [\eqref=eq:d_isotropy] was obtained in terms of isotropic parameters k and μ by Moakher and Norris [\cite=Moakher]. Using expression [\eqref=eq:c_iso], we can write the distance [\eqref=eq:d_isotropy] in terms of parameters [\eqref=eq:lambda] and [\eqref=eq:mu],

[formula]

Equivalently, using expressions [\eqref=eq:LambdaMu], we can write distance [\eqref=eq:d_isotropy] in terms of traces of the Voigt and dilatation tensors,

[formula]

Also, using expression [\eqref=eq:norm_eig], we can write this distance in terms of the eigenvalues of the elasticity tensor and the two eigenvalues of the closest isotropic tensor, which are expressions [\eqref=eq:lambda1] and [\eqref=eq:lambda2], to obtain

[formula]

Examining expression [\eqref=eq:d_iso3], we see that an elasticity tensor is close to being isotropic if and only if one of its eigenvalues is close to λiso1 and the other five are close to each other and to λiso2. In other words, the distance to isotropy measures the deviation of the eigenvalues of the elasticity tensor from the effective isotropic parameters.

Distance to cubic symmetry

In this section, we discuss the distance of an elasticity tensor to the class of cubic tensors. We fix B  =  {e1,e2,e3}, which is an orthonormal basis of [formula]. For an orthogonal transformation A∈O(3), consider AB: = {Ae1,Ae2,Ae3}, which is the corresponding orthonormal basis, and can be identified with the orthogonal transformation A.

We consider the components of elasticity tensor, cijkl, with respect to orthonormal basis A. The following cubic tensor, which has this orthonormal basis as its natural basis, has been proposed by Moakher and Norris [\cite=Moakher]:

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

According to Gazis et al. [\cite=Gazis], it follows that tensor ccube(A) given by expression [\eqref=eq:c_cubic] is positive-definite and hence represents an elasticity tensor. This elasticity tensor has three distinct eigenvalues:

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

with multiplicities m1 = 1, m2 = 2 and m3 = 3, as expected in view of the coordinate-free characterization formulated by B�na et al. [\cite=BBS1]. As we will see later, eigenvalue [\eqref=eq:eigen_cubic1] is an orthogonal invariant. The other two eigenvalues, [\eqref=eq:eigen_cubic2] and [\eqref=eq:eigen_cubic3], are not invariant under rotations of c, and hence depend on orientation A. These eigenvalues were considered also by Moakher [\cite=Moakher06] and coincide with parameters a, c and b, respectively, obtained by Moakher and Norris [\cite=Moakher].

Using matrices [\eqref=eq:Chapman] and [\eqref=eq:c_cubic] as well as expressions [\eqref=eq:c_comp1111] - [\eqref=eq:c_comp1212], one can show by direct calculations that [formula], which justifies the notation [formula], and implies that

[formula]

Therefore, the square of the distance between a given elasticity tensor, c, and its orthogonal projection, ccube(A), is

[formula]

This expression was obtained in terms of the cubic parameters a, b and c by Moakher and Norris [\cite=Moakher]. Using expression [\eqref=eq:norm_eig], we can write [formula] in terms of the eigenvalues of the given elasticity tensor and eigenvalues [\eqref=eq:eigen_cubic1], [\eqref=eq:eigen_cubic2] and [\eqref=eq:eigen_cubic3]. Hence, we write

[formula]

which expresses the deviations of the eigenvalues of the elasticity tensor from its orthogonal projection.

In order to obtain distance [formula] we have to minimize formula [\eqref=eq:d_cubic2] for A∈O(3), which is equivalent to maximizing function

[formula]

We now prove that λcube1(A) is an orthogonal invariant and we can find an orthogonal invariant relation between λcube2(A) and λcube3(A). Therefore, the process of maximizing function [\eqref=fcube] can be simplified.

First, we notice that the two linear invariants associated with the elasticity tensor, [formula] and [formula], remain invariant under orthogonal projection c  ↦  ccube. Let us denote the Voigt and dilatation tensors associated with c and its orthogonal projection, ccube(A), by V, Vcube(A) and D, Dcube(A), respectively. In view of expressions [\eqref=eq:Voigt] and [\eqref=eq:c_comp1111] - [\eqref=eq:c_comp1212], it follows that

[formula]

Examining expressions [\eqref=eq:lambda1] and [\eqref=eq:eigen_cubic1], or the invariance of [formula] under both projections c  ↦  ccube and c  ↦  ciso, we see that

[formula]

which shows that isotropy and cubic symmetry share one effective elasticity parameter; it is an isotropic invariant. In other words, λcube1 remains unchanged if the elasticity tensor is subject to an orthogonal transformation or its components are expressed in a different orthonormal basis. The other two eigenvalues of the cubic tensor, λcube2(A) and λcube3(A), are not isotropic invariants. However, examining expressions [\eqref=eq:eigen_cubic2], [\eqref=eq:eigen_cubic3] and [\eqref=eq:lambda2], we see that their combination is an isotropic invariant:

[formula]

Digressing, we note that, physically, the split of λiso2, which has multiplicity miso2 = 5, into λcube2 and λcube3, which have multiplicities mcube2 = 2 and mcube3 = 3, is related to the distinction between the eigenvalues that govern pure and simple shears, respectively, for cubic continua.

Expression [\eqref=eq:l23c_inv] is a consequence of the invariance for [formula] under both projections c  ↦  ccube and c  ↦  ciso, which can be written as

[formula]

In order to obtain the distance to the subspace of cubic tensors, we must minimize the value of expression [\eqref=eq:d_cubic2] or maximize the value of expression [\eqref=fcube], using [\eqref=eq:l1c_inv] and [\eqref=eq:l23c_inv]. Since this minimization is performed over the compact group O(3), it follows that the minimum of expression [\eqref=eq:d_cubic2] can be reached for an orthogonal transformation, Ae. Hence, there exists Ae∈O(3), such that

[formula]

Therefore, ccube(Ae) is the closest cubic tensor to elasticity tensor c. Eigenvalues λcube1(Ae), λcube2(Ae), λcube3(Ae) represent the effective cubic parameters, while Ae is the effective cubic orientation for the elasticity tensor c.

Since changes of orthonormal basis in [formula] affect neither the six eigenvalues of the elasticity tensor nor the isotropic invariant, λcube1, using expression [\eqref=eq:l23c_inv], we state expression [\eqref=eq:d_cubic2] as

[formula]

Both expressions [formula] and [formula] represent the square of the distance between ccube(A) and the class of isotropic tensors. In other words, we can rewrite expression [\eqref=eq:dc_diso] as

[formula]

Expression [\eqref=eq:dc_diso2] was implemented in the same context by Moakher and Norris [\cite=Moakher].

If in expression [\eqref=eq:dc_diso2] we choose A to be the effective cubic orientation Ae and use equation [\eqref=cubic_de], we obtain

[formula]

which illustrates the fact that, for a given elasticity tensor, its distance to isotropy is greater than its distance to any other material-symmetry class.

If in expression [\eqref=eq:d_cubic2] we choose A to be the effective cubic orientation Ae and use equation [\eqref=cubic_de], we obtain

[formula]

which expresses the deviations of the elasticity tensor from cubic symmetry, in terms of the effective cubic parameters. In other words, an elasticity tensor is close to having cubic symmetry if one of its eigenvalues is close to λcube1, two of them are close to one another and to λcube2(Ae), and the other three are close to each other and to λcube3(Ae).

Distance to transverse isotropy

In this section, we discuss the distance of an elasticity tensor to the class of transversely isotropic tensors. We consider the components of elasticity tensor, cijkl, with respect to orthonormal basis A. The following transversely isotropic tensor, which has this orthonormal basis as its natural basis, has been proposed by Moakher and Norris [\cite=Moakher]:

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

According to Gazis et al. [\cite=Gazis], it follows that tensor cTI(A) given by expression [\eqref=eq:c_ti] is positive-definite and hence it represents an elasticity tensor. This elasticity tensor has four distinct eigenvalues:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

with multiplicities m1 = 1, m2 = 1, m3 = 2 and m4 = 2, as expected in view of B�na et al. [\cite=BBS1]. Again, unlike eigenvalues [\eqref=eq:lambda1] and [\eqref=eq:lambda2], these eigenvalues are not invariant under rotations of c, and hence they explicitly depend on orthonormal basis A. These eigenvalues were also considered by Moakher [\cite=Moakher06]. The relations between these eigenvalues and the parameters obtained by Moakher and Norris [\cite=Moakher] are

[formula]

Using matrices [\eqref=eq:Chapman] and [\eqref=eq:c_ti] as well as expressions [\eqref=eq:ti_comp1111] - [\eqref=eq:ti_comp2323], one can show by direct calculations that [formula] which justifies the notation [formula], and implies that

[formula]

Therefore the square of the distance between a given elasticity tensor, c, and its orthogonal projection, cTI(A), is

[formula]

Expression [\eqref=eq:d_ti1] was obtained by Moakher and Norris [\cite=Moakher] using five parameters: a, b, c, f and g. Using expression [\eqref=eq:norm_eig], we can write [formula] in terms of the eigenvalues of the given elasticity tensor and the eigenvalues [\eqref=eq:eigen_ti1] - [\eqref=eq:eigen_ti4] of the orthogonal projection. Hence, we write

[formula]

which expresses the deviations of the eigenvalues of the elasticity tensor from those of the corresponding orthogonal projection.

Using expression [\eqref=eq:d_iso3], we write expression [\eqref=eq:d_ti2] as

[formula]

In order to obtain distance [formula], we have to minimize the above formula [\eqref=eq:d_ti3], for A in O(3), which is equivalent to maximizing function

[formula]

Even though these expressions are not invariant under orthogonal transformations, the two linear invariants associated with the elasticity tensor, [formula] and [formula], remain invariant. We denote the Voigt and dilatation tensors associated with c and its projection, cTI(A), by V, VTI(A) and D, DTI(A), respectively. In view of expressions [\eqref=eq:Voigt] and [\eqref=eq:ti_comp1111] - [\eqref=eq:ti_comp2323], it follows that

[formula]

which are analogous to expressions [\eqref=eq:invariant_tr_cub].

Examining expressions [\eqref=eq:eigen_ti1] - [\eqref=eq:eigen_ti4], or the invariance of [formula] under projections c  ↦  cTI and c  ↦  ciso, we obtain

[formula]

We note that [formula] can be expressed in terms of two eigenvalues λTI1, λTI2 and another orthogonal invariant, which is used by B�na et al. [\cite=BBS1] for characterizing transversely isotropic symmetry but does not appear explicitly in the distance function; it is referred to by B�na et al. [\cite=BBS1] as γ. Therefore, the invariance of [formula] does not have an influence on minimizing expression [\eqref=eq:d_ti2].

To obtain the distance to the class of transversely isotropic tensors, we minimize expression [\eqref=eq:d_ti2] under the restriction given by expression [\eqref=eq:inv_v_ti]. This is equivalent to maximizing function [\eqref=fti] under the same restriction. Using expression [\eqref=eq:inv_v_ti], we write expression [\eqref=eq:d_ti3] as

[formula]

which expresses the square of the distance to transversely isotropic projection.

The minimum value of [\eqref=eq:d_ti4] represents the square of the distance of the given tensor, c, to transverse isotropy. Since the minimization is performed over the compact group O(3), it follows that the minimum can be reached for an orthogonal transformation, Ae. Hence, there exists Ae∈O(3), such that

[formula]

Therefore, cTI(Ae) represents the closest isotropic tensor to elasticity tensor c. Eigenvalues λTI1(Ae), λTI2(Ae), λTI3(Ae), λTI4(Ae) represent the effective transverse isotropic parameters, while orthonormal basis Ae gives the effective orientation of the closest transversely isotropic counterpart to c.

If in expression [\eqref=eq:d_ti3] we choose A to be the effective transversely isotropic orientation, Ae, and use equation [\eqref=effective_dti], we obtain

[formula]

If in expression [\eqref=eq:d_ti2] we choose A to be the effective transversely isotropic orientation, Ae, and use equation [\eqref=effective_dti], we obtain

[formula]

which expresses the deviations of the elasticity tensor from transverse isotropy, in terms of the effective transversely isotropic parameters. In other words, an elasticity tensor is close to having transversely isotropic symmetry if one of its eigenvalues is close to λTI1(Ae), one is close to λTI2(Ae), two of them are close to one another and close to λTI3(Ae), and the other two are close to one another and close to λTI4(Ae).

Examples

In this section, we use the expressions derived above to illustrate the finding of the distance between a given elasticity tensor and isotropy, cubic symmetry and transverse isotropy. We consider both strongly and weakly anisotropic materials. In both cases, we present a density-scaled elasticity tensor in the Kelvin's notation stated in expression [\eqref=eq:Chapman].

Strong anisotropy

Let us consider a strongly anisotropic case, namely,

[formula]

which corresponds to biotite and exhibits transverse isotropy, as quoted by Thomsen [\cite=Thomsen]. Its anisotropy parameters defined by Thomsen [\cite=Thomsen] are γ = 6.12, δ =  - 0.39, ε = 1.22; their magnitude indicates strong anisotropy. The eigenvalues of this tensor are 66.07 and 15.95 with multiplicity one, and 47.62 and 3.60 with multiplicity two. Expression [\eqref=eq:Biotite] is considered with respect to a natural basis of the transversely isotropic medium.

Relation to isotropy

Using equations [\eqref=eq:lambda1] and [\eqref=eq:lambda2], we obtain the eigenvalues of the closest isotropic tensor, λiso1 = 53.80 and [formula], which are the effective isotropic parameters, as well as λ = 9.22 and μ = 13.06, which are the Lam� parameters of the closest representative of the isotropic subspace. Using these values and any of expressions [\eqref=eq:d_iso2] - [\eqref=eq:d_iso3], we obtain the distance to isotropy: [formula].

Relation to cubic symmetry

Using expressions [\eqref=eq:eigen_cubic1], [\eqref=eq:eigen_cubic2] and [\eqref=eq:eigen_cubic3], we obtain the eigenvalues of the corresponding cubic tensor, with respect to the fixed natural basis of elasticity tensor c: λcube1 = 53.80, λcube2 = 37.92 and λcube3 = 18.27. For an arbitrary orthonormal basis A, consider ccube(A) the cubic orthogonal projection. Invoking one of the equalities in expression [\eqref=eq:dc_diso] and using [formula] and λiso2 from above, we write

[formula]

To find the distance to the cubic-symmetry subspace, we look for λcube2(A) that minimizes this expression. The resulting distance [formula] is achieved by rotation of the natural basis of elasticity tensor c with the effective transformation

[formula]

The resulting cubic orthogonal projection ccube(Ae) represents the closest cubic tensor to c. Its eigenvalues, which are the effective cubic parameters for elasticity tensor [\eqref=eq:Biotite], are λcube1(Ae) = 53.80, λcube2(Ae) = 12.64 and λcube3(Ae) = 18.27. Minimizations described herein lend themselves to such software as Maple and Mathematica.

Relation to transverse isotropy

Minimizing expression [\eqref=eq:d_ti4] subject to λTI1, λTI2, λTI3 and λTI4 being positive, we obtain [formula], as expected. Since tensor [\eqref=eq:Biotite] is expressed in natural coordinates, we can obtain the same result using expressions [\eqref=eq:eigen_ti1] - [\eqref=eq:eigen_ti4] to calculate the eigenvalues of the effective transversely isotropic tensor, and verify that they are the same as the eigenvalues of tensor [\eqref=eq:Biotite].

Weak anisotropy

Let us consider a weakly anisotropic case, namely,

[formula]

which are the density-scaled elasticity parameters used by Dewangan and Grechka [\cite=Dewangan]. This is a generally anisotropic medium: it does not exhibit any material symmetry. The eigenvalues are distinct from each other: 8.02, 2.39, 2.16, 1.86, 1.82, 1.52.

Relation to isotropy

The eigenvalues of the closest isotropic tensor are λiso1 = 8.01 and [formula], which are the effective isotropic parameters, and the Lam� parameters are λ = 2.02 and μ = 0.98. Herein, the anisotropy is very weak: the distance to isotropy is [formula]. Notably, by inspection of the corresponding entries in matrices [\eqref=eq:c_iso] and [\eqref=eq:TenVlad] or by comparison of the eigenvalues of c and ciso, we can expect the closeness of this tensor to isotropy.

Relation to cubic symmetry

Proceeding in a manner analogous to the one described in Section [\ref=sub:Relation-to-cubic], we obtain [formula], where the effective orientation of the closest cubic tensor to elasticity tensor [\eqref=eq:TenVlad] is

The effective cubic parameters of the elasticity tensor [\eqref=eq:TenVlad] are λcube1(Ae) = 8.01, λcube2(Ae) = 0.59 and λcube3(Ae) = 2.08.

Relation to transverse isotropy

Proceeding in a manner analogous to the one described in Section [\ref=sub:Relation-to-transverse], we obtain [formula], where the effective orientation of the closest transversely isotropic tensor to elasticity tensor [\eqref=eq:TenVlad] is
