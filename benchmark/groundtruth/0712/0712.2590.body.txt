Twisting quasi-alternating links

Introduction

In [\cite=CM_PO], quasi-alternating links were shown to be homologically thin for both Khovanov homology and knot Floer homology. It is the most inclusive known description of homologically thin links. However, the recursive definition makes it difficult to decide whether a given knot or link is quasi-alternating.

([\cite=OzSz_double_covers]) The set Q of quasi-alternating links is the smallest set of links satisfying the following properties:

The unknot is in Q.

If the link L has a diagram L with a crossing c such that

both smoothings of c, L0 and L∞ as in Figure [\ref=skeinfig], are in Q;

det (L) =  det (L0) +  det (L∞);

then L is in Q.

We will say that c as above is a quasi-alternating crossing of L, and that L is quasi-alternating at c.

An oriented 3-manifold Y is called an -space if b1(Y) = 0 and [formula], where [formula] denotes the Heegaard-Floer homology. For a link L in S3 , let Σ(L) denote its branched double cover. The following property is the reason for interest in quasi-alternating links:

If L is a quasi-alternating link, then Σ(L) is an L-space.

In this note, we show that a quasi-alternating crossing can be replaced by an alternating rational tangle to obtain another quasi-alternating link (Theorem [\ref=maintheorem]). Thus, the set of quasi-alternating links includes many non-trivial infinite families.

For pretzel links, their Khovanov homology and knot Floer homology have been computed only for 3-strand pretzel links (see [\cite=OSz_2004] [\cite=Eftekhary] [\cite=Suzuki]). By repeatedly applying Theorem [\ref=maintheorem], we show that many pretzel links with arbitrarily many strands are quasi-alternating (Theorem [\ref=pretzeltheorem](1)). Therefore, their respective homologies can be computed from the signature and the Jones and Alexander polynomials. Most other pretzel links are not quasi-alternating since their Khovanov homology lies on exactly three diagonals (Theorem [\ref=pretzeltheorem](2)). Thus, Theorem [\ref=pretzeltheorem] gives the thickness of Khovanov homology for "most" pretzel links with arbitrarily many strands.

In Section [\ref=10crossqa], we apply Theorem [\ref=maintheorem] to complete the classification of quasi-alternating knots up to 10 crossings.

Finally, the Turaev genus plus two bounds the homological thickness for both Khovanov homology and knot Floer homology [\cite=Manturov] [\cite=dkh] [\cite=Lowrance]. The Turaev genus is preserved after inserting a rational tangle as in Theorem [\ref=maintheorem]. We do not know of any quasi-alternating links with Turaev genus greater than one.

Do there exist quasi-alternating links with arbitrary Turaev genus?

Twisting quasi-alternating links

Let c be a quasi-alternating crossing of a link diagram L, as in Definition [\ref=qadef]. We consider c as a 2-tangle with marked endpoints. Using Conway's notation for rational tangles, let ε(c) =   ±  1, according to whether the overstrand has positive or negative slope. We will say that a rational 2-tangle [formula] extends c if τ contains c, and for all i, ε(c)  ·  ai  ≥  1. In particular, τ is an alternating rational tangle.

If L is a quasi-alternating link diagram, let L' be obtained by replacing any quasi-alternating crossing c with an alternating rational tangle that extends c. Then L' is quasi-alternating.

We start with some background needed for the proof. For any connected link diagram L, we can associate a connected graph G(L), called the Tait graph of L, by checkerboard coloring complementary regions of L, assigning a vertex to every shaded region, an edge to every crossing and a ±   sign to every edge as follows:

[formula]

The signs are all equal if and only if L is alternating.

For any spanning tree T of G(L), let v(T) be the number of positive edges in T. Let sv(L) =   #  {spanning trees T of G(L) | v(T) = v}. Then

[formula]

Thistlethwaite [\cite=thistlethwaite] gave an expansion of the Jones polynomial VL(t) in terms of spanning trees T of G(L). Using this expansion, in [\cite=KHshort] for any spanning tree T, we defined a grading u(T), such that

[formula]

where w is the writhe of L, and k is a constant that depends on G (see the proof of Proposition 2 [\cite=KHshort]). Thus,

[formula]

Let L be a quasi-alternating diagram at crossing c. We may assume that ε(c) = 1 by rotating L as needed. For [formula], let Ln denote the link diagram with |n| additional crossings inserted at c, which are vertical positive half-twists if n > 0, and horizontal negative half-twists if n < 0. The cases n =   ±  2 are shown in Figure [\ref=skeinfig].

We first show that Ln is quasi-alternating at any inserted crossing. Suppose n  ≥  0. We checkerboard color L such that the edge e in G(L) that corresponds to c is positive. With the induced checkerboard coloring, the Tait graph G(L0) has the edge e contracted; G(L∞) has the edge e deleted; and G(Ln) has n additional vertices on e, dividing it into n + 1 positive edges [formula].

For every spanning tree T of G(L) such that e∈T, there is a unique spanning tree T' of G(L0), and a unique spanning tree T'' of G(Ln) such that [formula], then v(T'') = v(T) + n = v(T') + 1 + n. For every spanning tree T of G(L) such that e∉T, there is a unique spanning tree T' of G(L∞), and there are spanning trees [formula] of G(Ln) such that ei∉Ti, then for 0  ≤  i  ≤  n, v(Ti) = v(T) + n = v(T') + n. For each v,

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

By ([\ref=eq1]) with n = 0, sv(L)  =  sv - 1(L0)  +  sv(L∞). Hence

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula], so det (L0) = |x| and det (L∞) = |y|. Since L is quasi-alternating at c, det (L) =  det (L0)  +   det (L∞), that is |x + y| = |x| + |y|. Therefore, x  ·  y  ≥  0. It now follows from ([\ref=eq2]) for n  ≥  0,

[formula]

Let c denote any crossing in Ln added to L as above. Let Ln0 and Ln∞ denote the corresponding resolutions of Ln at c. We have Ln∞ = L∞ and Ln0 = Ln - 1 as links. For n  ≥  1, ([\ref=eq5]) implies

[formula]

We have that L0 = L and Ln∞ = L∞ as links, and hence are quasi-alternating. If Ln - 1 = Ln0 is quasi-alternating, then Ln is quasi-alternating by the equations above. By induction, Ln is quasi-alternating at c, so Ln is quasi-alternating at every inserted crossing.

Suppose n  ≤  0. If L is quasi-alternating at c then the mirror image [formula] is also quasi-alternating at c since det () =  det (L). Applying the argument above to [formula], and then reflecting proves this case for L.

Since every inserted crossing is quasi-alternating in Ln, we can iterate the construction above. Let [formula] be an alternating rational tangle that extends c. Since ε(c)  ·  ai  ≥  1 for all i, Lai is a vertical positive twist operation, and L- ai is a horizontal negative twist operation. We now construct:

[formula]

For example, see Figure [\ref=iteration]. The resulting link L' is quasi-alternating, and is obtained from L by replacing c with [formula].

The following lemma will be used in the next section.

If K and L are any quasi-alternating knot diagrams, then K  #  L is quasi-alternating.

The proof is by induction on det (K). For quasi-alternating K, if det (K) = 1 then K is the unknot, so the result follows. Otherwise, K is quasi-alternating at a crossing c, so the two smoothings at c, K0 and K∞, are quasi-alternating.

Since det (K) =  det (K0) +  det (K∞), both det (K0) <  det (K) and det (K∞)  <   det (K). By induction, both K0  #  L and K∞  #  L are quasi-alternating. Moreover,

[formula]

Therefore, K  #  L is quasi-alternating at c.

Pretzel links

If m,n  ≥  2 and all pi,  qj  ≥  2, then the Khovanov homology of [formula] has thickness exactly 3. More generally, any non-alternating Montesinos link, obtained by replacing pi > 1 (resp. qj > 1) half-twists with a rational tangle that extends at least two of these crossings, also has thickness exactly 3.

It is easy to check that for n,  m  ≥  2 and pi,  qj  ≥  2, the standard diagram for [formula] is adequate. By Proposition 5.1 of [\cite=KhPatterns], it has thick Khovanov homology. Since the Turaev genus of non-alternating pretzel links is one, the thickness bounds for Khovanov homology given in [\cite=dkh] [\cite=Manturov] are achieved by pretzel links whose Khovanov homology is thick. Since adequacy (and Turaev genus) is preserved after replacing any half-twists with a rational tangle that extends at least two of these crossings, the same argument applies to these Montesinos links.

Similarly, it follows that every non-alternating Montesinos link (see [\cite=BZ] for their classification) has Turaev genus one. However, some of these have thin Khovanov homology.

For n  ≥  1, pi  ≥  1 for all i, and [formula], the pretzel link [formula] is quasi-alternating.

For m,n  ≥  2 and all pi,  qj  ≥  2, the pretzel link [formula] is not quasi-alternating.

Both statements are true for all permutations of pi's and qj's, and reflections of all these pretzel links.

We first prove part (1) by induction on n. For n = 1, P(p1, - q)  =  T(2,p1 - q), which is quasi-alternating since p1 - q  ≠  0.

Let n  ≥  1 and pi  ≥  1 for all i. Suppose for [formula] is quasi-alternating. Consider [formula]. Without loss of generality, q  >  pi0 for some i0, with 1  ≤  i0  ≤  n. Let [formula], and let c be the crossing on the (n + 1)st strand. Let T(2,k) denote the alternating torus link. Then [formula] is quasi-alternating by Lemma [\ref=connectsum], and [formula] is quasi-alternating by the induction hypothesis.

By Lemma 4.3 of [\cite=DFKLS2],

[formula]

Now, q > pi0 implies [formula], so

[formula]

Therefore, det (L) =  det (L0) +  det (L∞), which proves that [formula] is quasi-alternating at c. By Theorem [\ref=maintheorem], [formula] is quasi-alternating for all pn + 1  ≥  1. This completes the proof of part (1) by induction.

By Proposition [\ref=pretzelKH] the pretzel links in part (2) have thick Khovanov homology, so they are not quasi-alternating.

The arguments above remain essentially unchanged for all permutations of pi's and qj's, and for all reflections, given by negating every pi and qj.

Widmer [\cite=Widmer] extended Theorem [\ref=pretzeltheorem] to certain Montesinos links.

3-strand pretzel links

Theorem [\ref=pretzeltheorem] still leaves open the quasi-alternating status of many pretzel links. For certain 3-strand pretzel links, this can be deduced from previous results. As above, the statements below for P(p1,p2, - q) are true for all permutations of pi's and q, and reflections of all these pretzel links.

According to [\cite=Josh_Greene] [\cite=Lisca_Stipsicz], for the pretzel link L = P(p1,p2, - q) with p1,p2,q  ≥  2, Σ(L) is an L-space if and only if

q  ≥   min {p1,p2}; or

q  =   min {p1,p2} - 1  and   max {p1,p2}  ≤  2q + 1.

By Proposition [\ref=Lprop], 3-strand pretzel links that satisfy neither (1) nor (2) above are not quasi-alternating. Together with Theorem [\ref=pretzeltheorem](1), this leaves open the quasi-alternating status for the following 3-strand pretzel links:

For p  ≥  q  ≥  2, is P(p,q, - q) quasi-alternating?

For 2q + 1  ≥  p  ≥  q + 1  ≥  3, is P(p,q + 1, - q) quasi-alternating?

Note that P(3,3, - 3) = 946 and P(4,3, - 3) = 10140. In addition, thick Khovanov homology or knot Floer homology precludes some of these links from being quasi-alternating (see [\cite=OSz_2004] [\cite=Eftekhary] [\cite=Suzuki]). For example, P(k,2, - 2) has thick Khovanov homology for 2  ≤  k  ≤  5 according to KhoHo [\cite=KhoHo].

Quasi-alternating knots up to 10 crossings

Manolescu [\cite=Manolescu08] showed that all KH-thin knots up to 9 crossings, except 946 are quasi-alternating. Among 42 non-alternating 10-crossing knots, 32 are KH-thin. Baldwin [\cite=Baldwin08] showed that 10 knots among these, which are closed 3-braids, are quasi-alternating. Greene [\cite=Josh_Greene] showed that eight more knots 10150,10151,10156, 10158, 10163, 10164, 10165, 10166 are quasi-alternating. We show that except for 10140, the remaining 13 knots are quasi-alternating. In the table below, we give the knot and its Conway notation (see [\cite=Kawauchi]). For our computations, we replaced the rational tangle indicated in bold with a crossing of same sign, and checked that this crossing is quasi-alternating in the new diagram. It follows from Theorem [\ref=maintheorem] that the knot is quasi-alternating.

As a result, all KH-thin knots up to 10 crossings, except 946 and 10140, are quasi-alternating. Shumakovitch [\cite=Shumakovitch] informed us that 946 and 10140 have thick odd Khovanov homology, so they are not quasi-alternating.
