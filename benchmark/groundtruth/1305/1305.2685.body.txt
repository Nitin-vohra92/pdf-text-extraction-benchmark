Abstract

We provide explicit ranges for σ for which the asymptotic formula holds as T  →    ∞  , when [formula], where ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta-function. The obtained ranges improve on an earlier result of the authors. An application to a divisor problem is also given.

Introduction

Let as usual [formula] denote the Riemann zeta-function, where s  =  σ + it is a complex variable. Mean values of ζ(s)   in the so-called "critical strip" [formula] represent a central topic in the theory of the zeta-function (see e.g., the monographs [\cite=IVi1] and [\cite=IVi2] for an extensive account). Of special interest are the moments on the so-called "critical" line [formula]. Unfortunately as of yet no bound of the form

[formula]

is known to hold when [formula], while in the cases m  =  1,2 precise asymptotic formulas for the integrals in question are known (see op. cit.). Throughout this paper, ε denotes fixed small positive constants, not necessarily the same ones at each occurrence, while [formula] denotes the dependence of the ≪  -constant on [formula].

Having in mind the difficulties of establishing (1.2) when [formula], it appeared interesting to consider the following problem. For any fixed integer [formula] let [formula] denote the infimum of all σ for which the estimate

[formula]

holds. The left-hand side of (1.2) may be called a "hybrid" moment, since it combines moments on the lines [formula] and [formula]. The problem is to estimate σ*4,j for a given [formula]. If the well-known Lindelöf hypothesis ([formula]) is true, then [formula] for any [formula] However, up to now even [formula] is out of reach by the use of existing methods. We cannot have [formula] in view of the functional equation

[formula]

In his work [\cite=IVi3] the first author investigated the integral in (1.2) for the case j = 1 and the case j = 2. In particular, he proved that [formula], while if [formula] is an exponent pair (see e.g., [\cite=GK] or Chapter 2 of [\cite=IVi1] for definitions) with [formula], then

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. Since ζ(σ + it)  ≪   log |t| for [formula], it is trivial that [formula] for any fixed [formula]. At the end of [\cite=IVi3] it was stated, as an open problem, to prove the strict inequality σ*4,j < 1 for any fixed [formula].

In [\cite=IZ], which is a continuation of [\cite=IVi3], the authors proved that indeed σ*4,j < 1 holds for any fixed [formula] In fact, if [formula] is an exponent pair with [formula] then we showed that

[formula]

In particular, we have [formula]

In [\cite=IZ] we also considered the possibilities of sharpening (1.2) to an asymptotic formula. We showed that, for any given integer [formula], there exists a number σ1  =  σ1(j) for which [formula] such that, when σ  >  σ1, there exists an asymptotic formula for the integral in (1.2). This is

[formula]

where all the coefficients ak,j(σ), which depend on σ and j, may be evaluated explicitly. However, in [\cite=IZ] we did not provide explicitly the range of σ for which (1.3) holds.

In this paper we shall provide some explicit values of σ for which (1.3) holds.

Theorem 1. The asymptotic formula (1.3) holds in the following ranges:

[formula]

Corollary 1.We have

[formula]

As an application of Theorem 1, we shall consider a weighted divisor problem. Suppose that [formula] is a fixed integer and a is a fixed real number. Define the divisor function

[formula]

where dk(n) denotes the number of ways n can be written as a product of k factors (so dk(n) is generated by ζk(s)). If a = 0, then [formula]

Henceforth we consider only the case a > 0. Suppose [formula] It is expected that the summatory function [formula] is asymptotic to

[formula]

as X  →    ∞  , where the constants [formula] and [formula] are effectively computable. More precisely, if one defines

[formula]

then we expect [formula] to hold as X  →    ∞  . Thus [formula] should represent the error term in the asymptotic formula for [formula]. It is also clear that the difficulty of the estimation of [formula] increases with [formula], and it also increases as a in (1.4) gets smaller.

By using (1.2) and the complex contour integration method, we can prove

Theorem 2. If [formula] then for [formula] fixed we have

[formula]

where [formula] if [formula] is even, and [formula] if [formula] is odd.

From Theorem 2 and Corollary 1 we obtain at once

Corollary 2. The estimate (1.5) holds for

[formula]

The necessary lemmas

In order to prove our results, we require some lemmas which will be given in this section. The first lemma is the following upper bound for the fourth moment of [formula] weighted by a Dirichlet polynomial.

Lemma 2.1. Let [formula] be complex numbers. Then we have, for [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

This result is due to N. Watt [\cite=Wa]. It is founded on the earlier works of J.-M. Deshouillers and H. Iwaniec [\cite=DI], which involved the use of Kloosterman sums, but Watt's result is sharper.

We also need some results on power moments of ζ(s).

Lemma 2.2. For any fixed [formula] let us define M(A) as

[formula]

Then we have the estimate

[formula]

Proof. The case [formula] is contained in Theorem 8.2 of Ivi [\cite=IVi1]. Now suppose that A > 178 / 13.

Suppose that [formula] are real numbers which satisfy

[formula]

and

[formula]

The large values estimate (8.29) of Ivi [\cite=IVi1] reads

[formula]

if we note that [formula] (see M. N. Huxley [\cite=Hu1] and [\cite=Hu2]).

We shall also use (8.33) of [\cite=IVi1], namely

[formula]

From (2.3) and (2.4) we obtain

[formula]

The formula (8.56) of Ivi [\cite=IVi1] reads

[formula]

From (2.4) and (2.6) we have

[formula]

Now Lemma 2.2 for the case A > 178 / 13 follows from (2.5) and (2.7).

Lemma 2.3. For 1 / 2 < σ < 1 fixed we define [formula] as the supremum of all numbers [formula] such that

[formula]

for any ε > 0. Then

[formula]

Proof. This is Theorem 8.4 of Ivi [\cite=IVi1]. In Ivi-Ouellet [\cite=IVO] some improvements have been obtained. Thus, it was shown there that [formula] for [formula] and [formula] for [formula], where [formula].

Lemma 2.4. Let [formula] be an integer, Q = 2q. Then for [formula] we have

[formula]

We also have

[formula]

Proof. The formula (2.9) is Theorem 2.12 of Graham and Kolesnik [\cite=GK]. The estimate (2.10) is to be found on page 66 of [\cite=GK]. It improves (2.9) in the case when q = 2, when one obtains the exponent [formula].

Lemma 2.5. Suppose [formula] are two real numbers such that

[formula]

then for [formula] we have

[formula]

Proof. This follows from the well-known Phragmén-Lindelöf principle (convexity); see e.g., Section 8.2 of [\cite=IVi1].

Lemma 2.6. Let

[formula]

where [formula], and α,β,γ,δ are complex numbers ≪  1 /  log T. Then for [formula] we have

[formula]

The function [formula] is given in term of explicit, albeit complicated Euler products.

Formula (2.12) is due to C. P. Hughes and M. P. Young [\cite=HY]. It is intended primarily for the asymptotic evaluation of the integral

[formula]

where

[formula]

is a Dirichlet polynomial of length Tθ with coefficients [formula]. The integral in (2.13) reduces to a sum of integrals of the type I(h,k) after one develops [formula] and chooses suitably the weight function w(t), which is discussed below. In general, the evaluation of the integral in (2.13) is an important problem in analytic number theory. It was studied by J.-M. Deshouillers and H. Iwaniec [\cite=DI], N. Watt [\cite=Wa] and most recently by Y. Motohashi [\cite=Mo], all of whom used powerful methods from the spectral theory of the non-Euclidean Laplacian. In [\cite=HY] Hughes and Young obtained an asymptotic formula for (2.13) when [formula] Two of the chief ingredients in their proof are an approximate functional equation for the product of four zeta values, and the so-called "delta method" of Duke, Friedlander and Iwaniec [\cite=DFI]. Watt's result (2.1) gives the expected upper bound [formula] in the range [formula], but does not produce an asymptotic formula for the integral in (2.13) (or (2.1)). At the end of [\cite=Mo], Y. Motohashi comments on the value [formula] of [\cite=HY]. He says: "Our method should give a better result than theirs, if it is combined with works by N. Watt on this mean value."

Note that the bound [formula] for (2.13) with [formula] would give the hitherto unproved sixth moment of zeta-function in the form

[formula]

which is (1.1) with m = 3.

The weight function [formula] which appears in the integral in (2.12) is a smooth function majorizing or minorizing the characteristic function of the interval

[formula]

such that w1(t)  =  1 for t∈[T,2T], and w(t)  =  w2(t) supported in

[formula]

Proof of Theorem 1

The case when j = 1

In this subsection we shall prove Theorem 1 in the case when j = 1. However, we shall deal with the general case and restrict ourselves to j = 1 only at the end of the proof.

Suppose [formula]. It suffices to evaluate the integral

[formula]

replace then T by T2- j for [formula] and sum the resulting estimates. For convenience, henceforth we set L: =  log T. Let s = σ + it, [formula] and [formula] We begin with the well-known Mellin inversion integral (see e.g., the Appendix of [\cite=IVi1]),

[formula]

where [formula] denotes integration over the line [formula]

Suppose T1 / 11  ≪  Y  ≪  T is a parameter to be determined later. In (3.1) we set x = n / Y, multiply by dj(n)n- s and then sum over n. This gives

[formula]

Suppose σ0 is fixed number which satisfies [formula] and will be determined later. In (3.2) we shift the line of integration to [formula] and apply the residue theorem. The pole at w = 1 - s, which is of degree j, contributes the residue which is ≪  T- 10, by Stirling's formula for Γ(w). The pole at w = 0 contributes the residue ζj(s). Thus we have

[formula]

By the well-known elementary estimate

[formula]

and partial summation it is easy to see that

[formula]

By Stirling's formula for Γ(w) again we have

[formula]

Let Y1: = T1 / 11 - ε. Inserting the above two estimates into (3.3) we can write

[formula]

say, where

[formula]

The partitioning in (3.4) is a new feature in the approach to this problem. The flexibility is present in the parameters Y and σ0, which will allow us to use Lemma 2.2 and Lemma 2.3, hence to connect our problem to the power moments of |ζ(σ + it)|.

Therefore from (3.4) we have, since [formula],

[formula]

Multiplying the above relation by [formula] and integrating, we obtain

[formula]

say, where

[formula]

The main contribution to the integral in (1.3) will come from the integral J1, with our choice Y1  =  T1 / 11 - ε. In [\cite=IZ], the authors evaluated the integral similar to J1 with the help of the result of Hughes and Young (Lemma 2.6). Actually, disregarding the harmless factor e- n / Y, the integral I1 in (4.6) of [\cite=IZ] is just the integral J1 if the parameter Y = T1 / (11j) - ε1 therein is replaced by Y1 = T1 / 11 - ε defined above. For the sake of completeness we shall give the details of the evaluation of J1. As a technical convenience, we consider instead of J1 the weighted integral

[formula]

with [formula] as in the discussion following Lemma 2.6. We note that and we shall show that the same asymptotic formula holds for the integral with w1(t) and w2(t) above, which will show then that such a formula holds for J1 as well. We write the square of the sum in (3.6) as

[formula]

where we put m  =  δh,n  =  δk,(h,k) = 1. With the aid of (3.7) it follows that J* reduces to the summation of integrals of the type

[formula]

We continue now the proof of Theorem 1, and we multiply (2.12) by

[formula]

and insert the resulting expression in (3.6). The error term in (2.12) makes a contribution which will be, since [formula], Note that [formula] because [formula]. Therefore we see, since [formula], as in the discussion made in [\cite=HY], that we obtain first the desired asymptotic formula, with an error term O(T1 - ε1) for some ε1 > 0, for the twisted integral J* in (3.6), with [formula] replaced by

[formula]

Finally, if α,β,γ,δ all tend to zero, we obtain the desired asymptotic formula

[formula]

and the coefficients bk;j(σ) depend on σ and j. It remains then to show that the contribution of Jk and Jk' in (3.5), for [formula], is of a lower order of magnitude than the right-hand side of (3.8), and Theorem 1 will follow.

We shall estimate the integral J2 by Lemma 2.1. We split the range of summation in B2(s) into O( log T) ranges of summation of the form

[formula]

Hence by Lemma 2.1 and the well-known elementary bound

[formula]

we have Since [formula], we see that

[formula]

if

[formula]

and the condition [formula] is seen to hold.

We turn now to the estimation of the integral J3. From its definition we have

[formula]

hence by using this bound and Cauchy's inequality we infer that

[formula]

Thus by integration we have

[formula]

Suppose now that σ0, besides [formula], also satisfies the condition

[formula]

Let

[formula]

Then

[formula]

and by Hölder's inequality for integrals we obtain

[formula]

We have

[formula]

where we shall use the bounds for M(A) furnished by Lemma 2.2. By Hölder's inequality again we have

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

From (3.14)-(3.16) and (3.11) we obtain

[formula]

if [formula]. With the choice (3.11) this condition reduces to

[formula]

To bound the integrals [formula] (see (3.5)) note that from (3.8), (3.10), (3.17) and Cauchy's inequality for integrals we obtain

[formula]

Obviously we have

[formula]

and consequently

[formula]

From (3.8), (3.10), (3.17) and (3.19)-(3.21) we obtain that, if (3.12) and (3.18) hold, This implies that where the ak;j's are constants which are easily expressible in term of the bk;j's.

Now we determine the permissible range of σ from (3.18) for the case j = 1. We take [formula]. Lemma 2.3 gives [formula], so (3.11) holds, and [formula]. Then (3.18) reduces to [formula]

Remark 1. When j = 2,3,4, the above procedure can also give non-trivial results. Actually, when j = 2, we take [formula] and (3.18) becomes [formula] When j = 3, we take [formula] and (3.18) becomes [formula] When j = 4, we take [formula] and (3.18) becomes [formula] However, in Subsection 2 we shall give better ranges for σ in these three cases.

Remark 2. When j  >  4, the above method does not give good results in view of the existing bounds for the functions M(A) and m(σ) defined in Lemma 2.2 and Lemma 2.3 respectively. However, in that case it is not difficult to see that (1.3) holds for σ  >  σ*4,j, the infimum of numbers for which (1.2) holds. Thus (1.3) will hold for [formula] when [formula] is an exponent pair. To see this, note first that the discussion preceding (3.12) yields

[formula]

This is the almost the same integral as the initial one, and the conclusion of Theorem 1 of our joint paper [\cite=IZ] holds, namely

[formula]

if

[formula]

and [formula] is an exponent pair. With σ0 as in (3.23) and [formula] one has trivially J3  ≪  T1 - 1 / 11 for δ,ε sufficiently small (since Y2σ0  -  σ  ≪  T- 2 / 11 + 2δε), and we get an asymptotic formula for the initial integral in the range σ  >  σ0 for j > 4.

Remark 3. We may further discuss the asymptotic formula (1.3). Denote by, say, E(T;σ,j) the difference between the left and right-hand side in (1.3), thus E(T;σ,j) is the error term in the asymptotic formula for our integral. Let c(σ,j) be the infimum of numbers c such that, for a given [formula],

[formula]

We know that c(σ,j)  <  1 by [\cite=IZ], and it seems reasonable to expect that [formula]. Namely in case when j = 0, we have the fourth moment of [formula], and in this case a precise asymptotic formula is known, and the exponent of the error term cannot be smaller than [formula] (see [\cite=IViM]). However, obtaining any qualitative results on c(σ,j) will be difficult, one of the reasons being that it is hard from the method of Hughes and Young [\cite=HY] to get explicit O-estimates for the error terms in their formulas.

The case when [formula]

To deal with the case [formula] we shall use an induction method. Namely, for each [formula] we shall prove that there is a constant [formula] such that (3.23) holds in the range σ > cj. When j = 1, we can take [formula] from the result in Subsection 1.

Let C(σ) > 0 be a function which connects [formula] and the points [formula] with line segments, where

[formula]

and q  =  q(j) will be suitably chosen. We then have, in view of Lemma 2.4 and Lemma 2.5,

[formula]

Now we suppose that [formula] and we have already defined cl for any [formula] From (3.22) and (3.26) we have

[formula]

if σ0 > cj - 1.

Take σ0 = cj - 1  +  δ, where δ > 0 is a small positive constant. When

[formula]

from (3.27) we have

[formula]

if δ,ε are sufficiently small.

We define the sequence [formula] as follows:

[formula]

It is easy to see that cj < 1 for any j since [formula] From the above procedure and the results in Subsection 1 we see that the asymptotic formula (1.3) holds for σ > cj for any [formula]

We provide now the explicit values of cj when j = 2,3,4,5,6, and we remark that continuing in this fashion we could obtain the values for j > 6 as well.

1. The case j = 2: from Lemma 2.4 we have [formula] [formula] Thus from Lemma 2.5 we have [formula] Hence

[formula]

2. The case j = 3: from (3.25) we have [formula] From Lemma 2.4 we have [formula] [formula] From Lemma 2.5 we get [formula] Hence

3. The case j = 4: we have [formula] From Lemma 2.5 we get [formula] Hence

4. The case j = 5: we have [formula] From Lemma 2.5 we get [formula] Hence

5. The case j = 6: we have [formula] From Lemma 2.5 we get [formula] Hence

Remark 4. It is not difficult to evaluate additional values of cj. For example, we have c7 = 0.983536, c8 = 0.987254, c9 = 0.990005, c10 = 0.992046, c11 = 0.993616. When j large, the value of cj is close to 1.

Remark 5. The values of [formula] depend on the upper bound of ζ(σ + it). Therefore we can improve the values of [formula] if we have better upper bounds for ζ(σ + it). For example, instead of Lemma 2.4 (Th. 2.12 of Graham-Kolesnik [\cite=GK]), we could use Theorem 4.2 of theirs (p. 38), which is strong for any [formula] Then we can get small improvements for any [formula] We also remark that we have (see (7.57) of [\cite=IVi1])

[formula]

where [formula] is an exponent pair. A judicious choice of the exponent pair [formula], especially the use of new exponent pairs due to M.N. Huxley (see e.g., his papers [\cite=Hu2] and [\cite=Hu3]), would likely lead to some further small improvements.

Kevin Ford [\cite=F] proved

[formula]

for [formula]. This estimate is quite explicit, and best when σ is close to 1. This estimate would imply better values of cj when j is large. There is, however, no simple procedure which yields (in closed form) the range for σ for which the asymptotic formula (1.3) holds, for any given j.

Proof of Theorem 2

In this section we shall prove Theorem 2. By the definition of the generalized function dk(n) we have, for [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

By using Perron's inversion formula (see e.g., the Appendix of [\cite=IVi1]) we have

[formula]

if we note that [formula] Now we put [formula] if [formula] is even, and [formula] if [formula] is odd, and then move the line of integration in (4.2) to [formula] In doing this we encounter two poles. These are s = 1, a pole of order four, and s = 1 - a which is a pole of order [formula] It is easy to verify that the sum of residues of the integrand in (4.2) is of the form (1.4). Thus from (1.5), (4.2) and the residue theorem we obtain

[formula]

say, where

[formula]

For ζ(s) we have the bounds

[formula]

which follows from the standard bounds

[formula]

and convexity (see e.g., (1.67) of [\cite=IVi1]). Recalling the condition

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

Now we estimate I1. When [formula] is even, we obtain directly I1  ≪  eX1 / 2 + ε, since [formula]. Therefore we consider in detail the case when [formula] is odd. Let [formula] Then we have by Cauchy's inequality that Since [formula], we have [formula] Hence from (1.2) we obtain

[formula]

Similarly we have

[formula]

From the above three estimates we obtain

[formula]

which combined with integration by parts gives

[formula]

By combining (4.3), (4.5) and (4.6) we complete the proof of Theorem 2.
