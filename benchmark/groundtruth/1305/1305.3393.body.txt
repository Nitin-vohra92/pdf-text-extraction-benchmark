Every Separable Metrizable Space has a Proper Dyadic Subbase

Introduction

The notion of a proper dyadic subbase was introduced in [\cite=T] to investigate in [formula]-codings of topological spaces, and domain representations induced by a proper dyadic subbase are investigated in [\cite=TT]. It is shown in [\cite=OTY] that every dense-in-itself separable metrizable space has an independent subbase, which is a proper dyadic subbase with some additional properties. In this article, we generalize this result and show that every separable metrizable space X has a proper dyadic subbase S whose restriction to the perfect set [formula] defined by the Cantor-Bendixson theorem forms an independent subbase of [formula] when [formula].

It is also proved in [\cite=OTY] that if X is a dense-in-itself separable metrizable space with dim X  =  m, then X has an independent subbase S with deg   S  =  m. We also generalize this result and show that if X is a separable metrizable space with dim X  =  m, then X has a proper dyadic subbase S with the above property such that deg   S  =  m.

Definitions:

A dyadic subbase of a space X is a subbase S  =  {Sn,i:n  <  ω,i < 2} indexed with ω  ×  2 which is composed of regular open sets and Sn,1 is the exterior of Sn,0 for each n  <  ω. Let [formula], [formula] for [formula], and [formula]. For a dyadic subbase S  =  {Sn,i:n  <  ω,i < 2} and [formula], let

[formula]

denote the corresponding subsets of X. The family [formula] is the base generated by S. We say that a dyadic subbase S  =  {Sn,i:n  <  ω,i < 2} is proper if [formula] for every [formula].

An independent subbase is a dyadic subbase S  =  {Sn,i:n  <  ω,i < 2} such that S(σ) is not empty for every [formula]. An independent subbase is always proper [\cite=OTY].

For a dyadic subbase S  =  {Sn,i:n < ω,i < 2} of a separable metric space X and x∈X, we define [formula] and deg S  =   sup { deg S(x):x∈X}.

Topological Lemmas

A space X is called hereditarily paracompact if every subspace of X is paracompact.

Let X be a hereditarily paracompact, Hausdorff space and Y a closed subspace of X. For every open sets U0 and U1 in Y such that [formula], there exist open sets V0 and V1 in X such that [formula] for each i = 0,1 and [formula].

By [\cite=E], there exist open sets W0 and W1 in X such that [formula] for each i = 0,1 and [formula]. Put

[formula]

For each i = 0,1 and each x∈Ui, since every paracompact Hausdorff space is regular, there is an open neighborhood Gx of x in X such that [formula]. Then the collection [formula] is an open cover of Z. Since Z is paracompact, G has a locally finite (in Z) open refinement H. Define

[formula]

for each i = 0,1. Then, Vi is open in X since Z is open in X, and [formula] for each i = 0,1. If H∈H and [formula], then H  ⊆  Gx for some x∈Ui, which implies that [formula]. By this fact and local finiteness of H in Z,

[formula]

for each i = 0,1. Hence, [formula], which implies that [formula].

Let X be a separable metric space. By the Cantor-Bendixson theorem, there exists a perfect (=   dense in itself) closed set [formula] in X such that [formula] is at most countable. Note that [formula]. By a clopen set we mean an open and closed set. We now call a subset G of X a half-clopen set in X if G is regular open in X and [formula].

Let X be a separable metric space, U a regular open set in [formula] and W an open set in X with [formula]. Then, there exists a half-clopen set V in X such that [formula] and V  ⊆  W.

By Lemma 1, there exist open sets V0 and V1 in X such that

[formula]

Since [formula] is 0-dimensional, there exists a clopen set H0 in [formula] such that [formula] and [formula]. Observe that [formula] is a half-clopen set in X. Put [formula]. Since F is closed in X and [formula], there is an open set G in X such that F  ⊆  G and [formula]. Since [formula] is 0-dimentional, there is a clopen set H1 in [formula] with F  ⊆  H1  ⊆  G. Then, H1 is clopen in X. Finally, we obtain a required half-clopen set V in X by letting [formula].

Main Theorems

Let X be a separable metric space. There exists a proper dyadic subbase S consisting of half-clopen sets in X such that [formula] is an independent subbase of [formula] when [formula].

If [formula], then for every countable base {Bn:n < ω} of X consisting of clopen sets, [formula] is a required proper dyadic subbase of X. So, we assume that [formula]. In [\cite=OTY] we proved that every dense in itself, separable metric space has an independent subbase. By applying it to [formula], we can define an independent subbase S  =  {Sn,i:n < ω,i < 2} of [formula]. The proof begins by taking a collection {Un,i:n < ω,i < 2} of non-empty regular open sets in [formula] such that [formula] for each n < ω and, for each [formula] and each neighborhood G of x in [formula], there is n < ω such that x∈Un,0 and Un,1  ⊆  G. Now, we can assume, in addition, that for each n < ω there is an open set [formula] in X with [formula] and for each [formula] and each neighborhood G of x in X, there is n < ω such that x∈Un,0 and [formula]. Then, the independent subbase S of [formula] is defined by induction on n < ω as follows. At the first step, S0,0 and S0,1 are defined to be U0,0 and [formula], respectively. At the n-th step, Sn,0 and Sn,1 are defined so as to satisfy that If such Sn,0 and Sn,1 were defined for all n < ω, then it follows from (1)-(4) that the resulting collection S  =  {Sn,i:n < ω,i < 2} is an independent subbase of [formula]. After having defined S, we extend, by induction on n < ω again, each Sn,i∈S to a half-clopen set [formula] in X satisfying that By Lemma 2, there is a half-clopen set [formula] in X such that [formula] and [formula]. Put [formula]. Then [formula] is also a half-clopen set in X with [formula]. Let n < ω and assume that a half-clopen set [formula] has been defined for each k < n and each i < 2. For each σ∈n2, let

[formula]

Then [formula] is a half-clopen set in X with [formula] by ([\ref=eq:2-1b]). At the n-th step in the proof of [\cite=OTY], the sets Sn,i, i < 2, are defined as

[formula]

where Vn is a carefully chosen (using [\cite=OTY]) regular open set in [formula] with [formula],

[formula]

and for each [formula], G(σ) is a non-empty regular open set in [formula] such that [formula] and [formula]. By Lemma 2, there is a half-clopen set [formula] such that

[formula]

Moreover, for each σ∈A, there is a half-clopen set [formula] such that [formula] and [formula], and, for each σ∈B, there is a half-clopen set [formula] such that [formula] and [formula]. Define

[formula]

Then, [formula], i < 2, are half-clopen sets and satify ([\ref=eq:2-2a]) and ([\ref=eq:2-2b]). By a similar argument to the proof in [\cite=OTY] that Sn,0 and Sn,1 satisfy ([\ref=eq:2-1d]), it can be checked that [formula] and [formula] satisfy ([\ref=eq:2-2c]). Hence, the induction is complete. It follows from the additional assumption on the sets [formula] and ([\ref=eq:2-2c]), for each [formula] and each neighborhood G of x in X, there is a finite set Γ  ⊆  ω and σ∈Γ2 such that

[formula]

Finally, since [formula] is 0-dimensional and [formula] is closed in X, there is a countable base {Hn:n < ω} of [formula] consisting of clopen sets in X. Then,

[formula]

is a required proper dyadic subbase of X.

Let X be a separable metric space with dim   X = m. Then, X has a proper dyadic subbase S with deg   S = m.

If [formula], then for every countable base {Bn:n < ω} of X consisting of clopen sets, [formula] is a proper dyadic subbase of X with deg   S = 0. So, we consider the case [formula]. Then, by [\cite=OTY], there exists an independent subbase S of [formula] with deg   S = m. By the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 1, we can extend S to a proper dyadic subbase [formula] of X. Then, [formula], since each member of S is either a half-clopen set or a clopen set in X.
