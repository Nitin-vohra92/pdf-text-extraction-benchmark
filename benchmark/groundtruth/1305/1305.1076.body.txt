On the spinor L-function of Miyawaki-Ikeda lifts

Introduction

In [\cite=Mi] Miyawaki conjectured the existence of lifts from pairs of two elliptic modular forms of level one to Siegel modular forms of degree three. This Miyawaki's conjecture was partially solved by Ikeda [\cite=Ik2]. Furthermore, Ikeda constructed certain lifts from pairs of an elliptic modular form and a Siegel modular form to Siegel modular forms in general degrees. In this paper we call these lifts Miyawaki-Ikeda lifts.

In [\cite=He] Heim showed that the spinor L-function of the Siegel cusp form of weight 12 of degree 3, which is a Miyawaki-Ikeda lift, is a product of certain L-functions obtained from two elliptic cusp forms. This identity of the spinor L-function was originally conjectured by Miyawaki [\cite=Mi]. The purpose of the present paper is to generalize the result about the spinor L-function in [\cite=He] for Miyawaki-Ikeda lifts in arbitrary weights and in arbitrary odd degrees.

We remark that the identity for the standard L-function of Miyawaki-Ikeda lifts have already been given in [\cite=Ik2]. For the case of Miyawaki-Ikeda lifts of two elliptic modular forms, in [\cite=MaassRe] we obtain another proof of this identity of the standard L-function by using generalized Maass relations.

We explain our results more precisely. Let f∈S2k(Γ1) and g∈Sk + n(Γ1) be elliptic modular forms of weight 2k and of weight [formula], respectively. We assume that both forms f and g are normalized Hecke eigenforms. Let λf(p) and λg(p) be the p-th Fourier coefficients of f and g, respectively. We denote by {α±p} and {β±p} the sets of complex numbers determined through the identities:

[formula]

For any integer m  >  1 we set

[formula]

and define

[formula]

for [formula]. We put [formula], which is the usual Hecke L-function of g.

Let Ff,g∈Sk + n(Γ2n - 1) be the Siegel modular form of weight k + n of degree 2n - 1 which is the Miyawaki-Ikeda lift of (f,g). (see Section [\ref=sec:spinor_Miyawaki] for the definition of Ff,g.) Let T2n - 1(p) be the Hecke operator which will be denoted in the next section. Then we obtain the main theorem.

We assume [formula]. Then Ff,g is an eigenform for Hecke operators T2n - 1(p) for any prime p. Furthermore, the spinor L-function of Ff,g satisfies

[formula]

for [formula], where β(r,m,n) is a non-negative integer given in [\cite=Sch] (see also ([\ref=id:beta]) in Section [\ref=sec:Ikeda].)

In the case of (n,k)  =  (2,10), namely in the case of Ff,g∈S12(Γ3), this theorem has been shown by Heim [\cite=He].

We remark that Theorem [\ref=thm:main] has already been given in [\cite=Mu]. However, the proof in [\cite=Mu] is not available, because a necessary property for the Fourier coefficients of the Klingen-Eisenstein series is not known (see also the Final remarks in [\cite=He].) The proof in the present paper for Theorem [\ref=thm:main] depends on a generalization of Maass relation for Duke-Imamoglu-Ibukiyama-Ikeda lifts.

This paper is organized as follows: In Section [\ref=sec:notation] we will give notation and in Section [\ref=sec:Ikeda], we will review the spinor L-function of the Duke-Imamoglu-Ibukiyama-Ikeda lifts. In Section [\ref=sec:spinor_Miyawaki] we will review the Miyawaki-Ikeda lifts and we shall give the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

Notation

Symbols

The symbol (a1,...,an) denotes the diagonal matrix with diagonal elements a1, ..., an. The symbol Mn,m(R) is the set of all matrices of size n times m with entries in a commutative ring R. We put Mn(R): = Mn,n(R). For a natural number n we set [formula]. The letter p is reserved for prime numbers.

Let [formula] be the symplectic group with matrix of size 2n with entries in [formula]. For the field [formula] or [formula], we define

[formula]

where [formula]. The above number ν(M) is called the similitude of M∈+n(K).

The symbol [formula] denotes the Siegel upper half space of size n.

We denote by Sk(Γn) the space of Siegel cusp forms of weight k of degree n and denote by Jk,m(Γn) (resp. Jcuspk,m(Γn)) the space of Jacobi forms (resp. Jacobi cusp forms) of weight k of index m of degree n (cf. [\cite=Zi] for the definition of Jacobi forms in higher degrees.) We remark that any element in Jk,m(Γn) is a holomorphic function on [formula].

L-functions of Siegel modular forms

For any function F on [formula] and for [formula] we define the slash-operator |k by

[formula]

Here M  ·  τ: = (Aτ  +  B)(Cτ  +  D)- 1 is the linear fractional transformation.

For any Siegel modular form F of weight k with respect to Γn and for any positive integer N, we define

[formula]

Here we defined

[formula]

We denote by [formula] (resp. [formula]) the Hecke ring with respect to the Hecke pair [formula] (resp. [formula].)

We set [formula]. Then it is known that the Hecke ring [formula] has the local decomposition

[formula]

There exists the isomorphism [formula] which is called the Satake isomorphism, where [formula] is the subring of all Wn-invariant elements in the polynomial ring [formula]. Here Wn is the Weyl group of symplectic group. The action of Wn on [formula] is generated by the maps

[formula]

for i = 1,...,n, and by all permutations of {x1,...,xn}.

Let F∈Sk(Γn) be a common eigenform for all Hecke operators for [formula]. Then there exists a set of complex numbers {μ0,μ1,...,μn}: = {μ0,p,μ1,p,...,μn,p} determined by the eigenvalues of F and by the Satake isomorphism. Such a set of complex numbers {μ0,μ1,...,μn} is called the Satake parameters and is uniquely determined by F and by prime p up to the action of the Weyl group Wn.

The spinor L-function L(s,F,) and the standard L-function L(s,F,) are defined by

[formula]

and by

[formula]

where {μ0,μ1,...,μn} is the Satake parameters of F. Here

[formula]

To determine the standard L-function of F, the function F is only required to be a common eigenform for all Hecke operators for [formula]. If F is a common eigenform for all Hecke operators for [formula] and also for all Hecke operators Tn(p) for any prime p, then F is a common eigenform for all Hecke operators for [formula], and the spinor L-function of F is determined.

The spinor L-function of Duke-Imamoglu-Ibukiyama-Ikeda lifts

In this section we review the identity about the spinor L-function of Duke-Imamoglu-Ibukiyama-Ikeda lifts. This identity has been given by Schmidt [\cite=Sch] and Murakawa [\cite=Mu], independently.

Let f∈S2k(Γ1) be a normalized Hecke eigenform. We put F2n∈Sk + n(Γ2n) the Duke-Imamoglu-Ibukiyama-Ikeda lift of f. We remark that this lift was conjectured by Duke and Imamoglu and also by Ibukiyama, independently, and shown by Ikeda [\cite=Ik]. In [\cite=Ik] Ikeda proved that F2n is a common eigenform for all Hecke operators for [formula] with the standard L-function

[formula]

Murakawa [\cite=Mu] and Schmidt [\cite=Sch] independently obtained the following lemma.

The Duke-Imamoglu-Ibukiyama-Ikeda lift F2n is a common eigenform for all Hecke operators for [formula]. Furthermore, the Satake parameters {μ0,μ1,...,μ2n} of F2n is determined by [formula] and

[formula]

up to the action of the Weyl group.

Let {α±p} and Ap,m be the same symbols in Section [\ref=sec:intro]. We set the symmetric power L-function of f by

[formula]

Here, if m = 0 we set [formula].

In [\cite=Sch] two functions α(n,m,r) and β(n,m,r) are introduced. We quote these definitions from [\cite=Sch]: Let α(r,m,n) be the number of possibilities to choose m different numbers from the set {1 - 2n,3 - 2n,...,2n - 1} (not observing the order) such that their sum equals r. We define

[formula]

The reader is referred to [\cite=Sch] for the table of numerical values of α(r,m,n) and β(r,m,n) (n  ≤  6).

From Lemma [\ref=lem:spin_ms] the following theorem follows.

The spinor L-function of F2n satisfies the identity

[formula]

We remark that for any n we have β(r,0,n)  =  1 if r  =  0, 0 otherwise. Hence

[formula]

The spinor L-function of Miyawaki-Ikeda lifts

In this Section [\ref=sec:spinor_Miyawaki], first we review Miyawaki-Ikeda lifts in Section [\ref=ss:mi_lift]. And we restrict ourselves to a special case of Miyawaki-Ikeda lifts, namely we consider the lift

[formula]

From Section [\ref=ss:index_shift] to Section [\ref=ss:gen_maass] we recall some properties of Fourier-Jacobi coefficients of Duke-Imamoglu-Ibukiyama-Ikeda lifts. Finally, we shall prove Theorem [\ref=thm:main] in Section [\ref=ss:proof] and give some examples of spinor L-functions in Section [\ref=ss:example].

Miyawaki-Ikeda lifts

We review Miyawaki-Ikeda lifts shown by Ikeda [\cite=Ik2]. Let r be an integer such that r  ≤  n. Let f∈S2k(Γ1) be a normalized Hecke eigenform and let g∈Sk + n(Γr) be a Hecke eigenform. Let F2n∈Sk + n(Γ2n) be the Duke-Imamoglu-Ibukiyama-Ikeda lift of f. For [formula] we put

[formula]

Here [formula]. Then it is not difficult to show that the form Ff,g belongs to Sk + n(Γ2n - r).

In [\cite=Ik2] Ikeda has shown: If [formula], then the function Ff,g is a common eigenform for Hecke operators for [formula]. Moreover the standard L-function of Ff,g satisfies the identity

[formula]

In the present article we only consider the case r = 1, but n is any positive-integer. In the case of r = 1, the above identity of L(s,Ff,g,) is also shown in [\cite=MaassRe] by using certain generalized Maass relations.

Index-shift operators for Jacobi forms

For [formula] we define

[formula]

For a function φ on [formula] and for [formula] we define

[formula]

where e(x): = e2πix and M  ·  (τ,z): = (M  ·  τ,ν(M)t(Cτ  +  D)- 1z).

For any positive integer N and for φ∈Jk,m(Γn), we define two operators Vn(N) and Un(N) :

[formula]

We remark that φ|Vn(N)∈Jk,mN(Γn) and φ|Un(N)∈Jk,mN2(Γn) (cf. [\cite=Ya].) And if φ∈Jcuspk,m(Γn), then φ|Vn(N) and φ|Un(N) are Jacobi cusp forms.

Restriction map

We define a linear map [formula] by

[formula]

for φ∈Jcuspk,m(Γn) and for [formula].

By straightforward calculation we obtain the following lemma.

For any φ∈Jcuspk,m(Γn) we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

A generalized Maass relation

Let [formula] be the Fourier-Jacobi expansion of F2n, where [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Here F2n is the Duke-Imamoglu-Ibukiyama-Ikeda lift of f∈S2k(Γ1).

We define the operator D2n - 1(m,{α±p}) through the formal Dirichlet-series

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here the set of complex numbers {α±p} is the same notation in Section [\ref=sec:intro], [\ref=sec:Ikeda]. Because any two operators in [formula] are compatible, the above definition of D2n - 1(m,{α±p}) is well-defined.

In particular, for any prime p we have

[formula]

In [\cite=FJlift] we obtained the following relation.

For any positive integer m we have

[formula]

We remark that the relation in Lemma [\ref=lem:FJ1] was originally given by Yamazaki [\cite=Ya] in the case of Siegel-Eisenstein series of arbitrary degrees. Lemma [\ref=lem:FJ1] is a certain kind of generalization of the Maass relation.

In [\cite=KK] Katsurada and Kawamura showed the following lemma.

For any φ∈Jk,l(Γ2n - 1) and for any set of complex numbers {c±p} we have

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=lem:FJ1] and Lemma [\ref=lem:kk], we have the following corollary.

For any positive integers m and m', we have

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]

In this subsection we shall prove Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

Let f and g be the same notation in the introduction, and let Ff,g be the Miyawaki-Ikeda lift of (f,g). The other symbols like λg(p), {α±p}, {β±p}, F2n and ΦF2nm are the same as before.

First we shall show the following lemma.

If [formula], then Ff,g is an eigenform for the Hecke operator T2n - 1(p) for any prime p with the eigenvalue

[formula]

We put

[formula]

Then, by using Lemma [\ref=lem:VT] and Corollary [\ref=cor:maass], we have

[formula]

Here we regard ΦF2nm / p as identically 0 if m is not divisible by p.

Hence

[formula]

where the Hecke operator T2n - 1(p) acts on [formula] with respect to the variable [formula], while the Hecke operator T1(p) acts on [formula] with respect to the variable [formula].

Because

[formula]

we conclude

[formula]

Thus this lemma follows.

Let {μ0,μ1,...,μ2n - 1} be the Satake parameters of Ff,g. Here

[formula]

We now calculate the Satake parameters of Ff,g by using Lemma [\ref=lem:Tp].

For n  ≥  2 we obtain

[formula]

and

[formula]

up to the action of the Weyl group.

We remark

[formula]

Hence, due to the identity of the standard L-function of Ff,g in Section [\ref=ss:mi_lift], we can take

[formula]

First we assume β2p  ≠   - 1. It is known that the eigenvalue of Ff,g for T2n - 1(p) is [formula] (cf. [\cite=Fr].) And [formula]. Thus, by virtue of Lemma [\ref=lem:Tp], we obtain [formula].

If β2p  =   - 1, then without loss of generality we can set μ2n - 1  =  β2p  =   - 1. Because {μ0,μ1,...,μ2n - 2, - 1} and {  -  μ0,μ1,...,μ2n - 2, - 1} belong to the same equivalent class with respect to the action of the Weyl group, and because of the identity

[formula]

we can take [formula].

As a consequence of Lemma [\ref=lem:Tp] and Lemma [\ref=lem:Ffg_eigenvalue], we obtain Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

Examples of spinor L-functions of Miyawaki-Ikeda lifts

In this subsection we give some examples. We assume [formula] for each case.

Degree 3.

If n = 2, then f∈S2k(Γ1), g∈Sk + 2(Γ1) and Ff,g∈Sk + 2(Γ3). We have

[formula]

Here we set [formula].

We remark that it has been shown in [\cite=He] that if the pullback of the Duke-Imamoglu-Ibukiyama-Ikeda lift [formula] is not identically zero, then there exists Hecke eigenforms H∈Sk + 2(Γ3) and g∈Sk + 2(Γ1) such that [formula], where f∈S2k(Γ1) is the preimage of the Duke-Imamoglu-Ibukiyama-Ikeda lift F4∈Sk + 2(Γ4).

If n = 3, then f∈S2k(Γ1), g∈Sk + 3(Γ1) and Ff,g∈Sk + 3(Γ5). We have

[formula]
