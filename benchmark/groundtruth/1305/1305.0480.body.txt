Quasi-regular representations and rapid decay

Introduction

We say that a unitary representation π:G  →  U(H) on a complex Hilbert space H of a locally compact group G with a left invariant Haar measure dg and with a length function L has property RD w.r.t. to L (with respect to L) if there exist d  ≥  1 and C > 0, such that π verifies for all f∈L1(G,dg),

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the operator norm, and

[formula]

Equivalently, a representation π:G  →  U(H) has property RD w.r.t. L if there exist d  ≥  1 and C > 0 such that for each pair of unit vectors ξ,η on H we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

We say that a locally compact group has property RD w.r.t. L if its regular representation has property RD w.r.t. L.

The property of rapid decay was introduced by U. Haagerup at the end of the seventies in his work [\cite=H]. Its essence could probably be traced back to Harish-Chandra's estimates of spherical functions on semisimple Lie groups and to the work of C. Herz [\cite=He]. The terminology "property RD" was introduced later, see the work [\cite=Jo] of P. Jolissaint. Property RD is relevant in the context of the Baum-Connes conjecture thanks to the important work of V. Lafforgue in [\cite=L].

Equivalent definitions of property RD, Hilbert-Schmidt and trace class operators

Let π:G  →  U(H) be a unitary representation of G. For ξ and η in H, we define the matrix coefficient associated to π, as [formula]. Let L2(H) be the Hilbert space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators on the Hilbert space H. Recall that the scalar product of Hilbert-Schmidt operators on H is defined as [formula] where Tr denotes the usual trace on B(H), and T* denotes the adjoint operator of T (see Subsection [\ref=spaces]). Consider the representation

[formula]

defined by

[formula]

for all T in L2(H). For S and T in L2(H), the matrix coefficient associated to c is [formula]. The Hilbert space L2(H) contains the Banach space of trace class operators on the Hilbert space H denoted by L1(H). The restriction of the representation c to L1(H) is a isometric Banach space representation for the norm [formula] (see Subsection [\ref=repre]). In Section [\ref=sec2] we prove the following proposition:

Let G be a locally compact second countable group, and let μ be a Borel measure on G which is finite on compact subsets. Let π:G  →  U(H) be a unitary representation on a Hilbert space, and let c denote the corresponding Banach space representation defined above. The following conditions are equivalent.

There exists C > 0 such that for all S,T unit vectors in L1(H) (unit for [formula]) we have

[formula]

There exists C > 0, such that for all unit vectors ξ,η in H we have

[formula]

For all vectors S,T in L1(H) we have

[formula]

For all vectors ξ,η in H we have

[formula]

Let μ be the following measure

[formula]

where dg denotes a Haar measure on G, and where d is some positive real number. Applying Proposition [\ref=main] with this special choice of measure provides us with four equivalent definitions of property RD for unitary representations.

A simple condition for property RD for positive representations

Consider now a representation π:G  →  U(H) such that H  ⊂  L2(X,m) where (X,m) is a measured space i.e. a vector ξ in H is a complex valued function and for all ξ and η in H we have [formula]. We say that a function ξ is positive if ξ  ≥  0 almost everywhere w.r.t. m. Let

[formula]

be the cone of positive functions of H. In this context, we say that π is positive if for all g in G, we have

[formula]

Typical examples of positive representations are provided by unitary representations coming from measurable actions [formula] where m is a G-quasi-invariant measure (see Subsection [\ref=sec3]).

The following proposition proved in Section [\ref=sec4] brings a simple condition for property RD for positive representations:

Let G be a locally compact second countable group with a length function L. Let π:G  →  U(H) be a unitary representation such that H  =  L2(X,m) with (X,m) a measured space. Assume that π is positive. The following conditions are equivalent:

π has property RD w.r.t. L i.e. there exist d  ≥  1 and C > 0 such that for all ξ,η unit vectors in H, we have

[formula]

For each positive function ξ∈H+, there exists dξ  ≥  1 such that

[formula]

Positive vectors

We shall consider another notion of positivity. Let π be a unitary representation of a locally compact group G on a complex Hilbert space H. Following Y. Shalom (see [\cite=S]), we say that a nonzero vector ξ∈H is a positive vector if it satisfies

[formula]

This notion is particularly interesting for property RD. In fact, in order to prove property RD w.r.t. L for a group (i.e. for the left regular representation) it suffices to prove property RD w.r.t. L for a representation with a positive vector.

Coefficients with slow decay and lattices

Let G be a locally compact group with a length function L and let μ be a Haar measure on G i.e. [formula], where 1B denotes the characteristic function of a Borel subset B of G. Denote by BL(R) the ball (w.r.t. L) of radius R whose center is the neutral element of G. We say that G has polynomial growth w.r.t. L if there exists a polynomial P such that for all R > 0 we have

[formula]

It is easy to check that G has polynomial growth w.r.t. L if and only if there exists a positive number d such that

[formula]

Cauchy-Schwarz inequality implies that a unitary representation of a group of polynomial growth w.r.t. L satisfies property RD w.r.t. L.

If a locally compact group G admits a unitary representation satisfying property RD w.r.t. L and with a non zero invariant vector, then G must be a group of polynomial growth w.r.t. L. Therefore, we are interested in representations without non zero invariant vectors.

Let G be locally compact group. Consider an action [formula] of G on (X,m) where m is a G-quasi-invariant measure. Consider the unitary representation

[formula]

associated to this action on the Hilbert space L2(X,m). Observe that πα is a positive representation (see Subsection [\ref=sec3]).

Let Γ be a discrete countable group with a length function L. Consider an action [formula] on a σ-finite measured space (X,m) with a Γ-quasi-invariant measure m. Consider πα:Γ  →  U(L2(X,m)) the unitary representation associated to [formula]. Assume that Γ contains a cyclic subgroup of exponential growth w.r.t. L. Then there exists ξ in L2(X,m)+ such that for all d  ≥  1 we have

[formula]

The theorem is trivialy true if πα contains a non zero invariant vector which is in L2(X,m)+. For example consider the representations obtained from an action [formula] where m is a finite Γ-invariant measure. The constant function 1X is a non zero invariant vector which is in L2(X,m)+. Examples of representations without non zero invariant vectors are described in Subsection [\ref=invariant]. In the following, Lie groups are endowed with a length function associated to a left-invariant Riemannian metric. According to A. Lubotzky, S. Mozes and M.S Raghunatan (see [\cite=Lu]), any non-uniform irreducible lattice in a higher rank semisimple Lie group contains a cyclic subgroup of exponential growth.

In Subsection [\ref=qr'], we assume that G is locally compact second countable and can be written G = KP, where K is a compact subgroup and P is a closed subgroup which is not unimodular. Consider λG / P:G  →  U(L2(G / P)) the quasi-regular representation associated to P. The Harish-Chandra function

[formula]

is the diagonal coefficient of λG / P defined by the characteristic function 1G / P of the space G / P. Following Gangolli and Varadarajan, [\cite=GV], we say that a function f on the group G equipped with a length function L, verifies the weak inequality of Harish-Chandra if there exist C > 0 and d  ≥  0 such that

[formula]

We prove:

Corollary [\ref=coro2] holds true for H: = P a minimal parabolic subgroup of a non-compact semisimple Lie group with finite center. Although it is known that a coefficient [formula] with η∈L2(G / P) not in L∞(G / P), does not satisfy the weak inequality (it is a consequence of Fatou's Theorem for semisimple Lie groups, see [\cite=Sj]), Corollary [\ref=coro1] gives a new proof of this result. More generally, Corollary [\ref=coro1] implies that there exist matrix coefficients associated to any quasi-regular representations that do not satisfy the weak inequality of Harish-Chandra. Although the matrix coefficient [formula] with η∈L2(G / P) not in L∞(G / P) does not satisfy the weak inequality, we prove in Section 4 the following:

Let G be a non-compact semisimple Lie group with finite center. Let Γ be any discrete subgroup of G. Consider P a minimal parabolic subgroup of G, and λG / P:G  →  U(L2(G / P)) the quasi-regular representation associated to P. Then there exist C > 0 and d  ≥  1 such that for all η∈L2+(G / P) we have

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the L2-norm on L2(G / P).

From square integrable representations to integrable representations

Spaces

Hilbert spaces

Let H be a separable complex Hilbert space with a scalar product that verifies [formula] for all ξ,η∈H and for all [formula]. Let [formula] be its conjugate space. Recall [formula] as an additive group. The external law for [formula], ξ∈H is defined by [formula], and the scalar product is [formula]. We consider the algebraic tensor product [formula] with the scalar product defined by [formula]. We denote [formula] the Hilbertian completion of the algebraic tensor product.

We denote by B(H) the space of bounded operators on H. Let Tr denotes the usual trace on B(H) defined on positive bounded operators: for Hilbertian orthonormal basis [formula] of H, for a positive operator A∈B(H), we have [formula]. The trace Tr does not depend on the choice of the orthonormal basis. A bounded operator T is called Hilbert-Schmidt if it verifies Tr(|T|2) <   ∞  , where [formula]. We denote by L2(H) the set of Hilbert-Schmidt operators on H. The set of Hilbert-Schmidt operators is a subset of the set of compact operators, and it is a Hilbert space under the scalar product [formula]. Its associated norm is [formula] . It is well known that T is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator if and only if there exist two orthonormal basis [formula] and [formula] and a sequence [formula] such that the following convergent series in operator norm verifies

[formula]

If [formula], then [formula]. The map :

[formula]

is an isomorphism of Hilbert spaces. See [\cite=D] and [\cite=Pa] for more details.

Banach spaces

A bounded operator T is trace class if it verifies Tr(|T|) <   ∞  , where [formula]. As in the introduction, L1(H) denotes the set of trace class operators on H. It is a subspace of the Hilbert-Schmidt operators on H. It is a Banach space under the norm ||T||1 = Tr(|T|). It is well known that T is trace class if and only if there exist two orthonormal bases [formula] and [formula] and a sequence [formula] such that the following convergent series in operator norm verifies

[formula]

If [formula], then ||T||1 = ||α||l1. We recall now the definition of the projective tensor product of Banach spaces. Let X and Y be Banach spaces with norms ||.||X and ||.||Y. We consider the algebraic tensor product [formula]. The projective norm of an element u in [formula] is defined as

[formula]

The projective tensor product is defined as the completion of the algebraic tensor product for the projective norm p, and it is denoted by

[formula]

If H and K denote two Hilbert spaces, we observe that [formula]. The map Φ defined above restricts to an isometric Banach space ismorphism :

[formula]

For more details see [\cite=R].

Representations

Let G be a locally compact group. Let π:G  →  U(H) be a unitary representation on a Hilbert space. Consider c as in the introduction. Write [formula]. We have

[formula]

Observe that [formula] and [formula]. Hence, c is a unitary representation on L2(H) and it is an isometric Banach space representation on L1(H). Let [formula] be the conjugate unitary representation on [formula] of π. Let σ be the unitary representation:

[formula]

The isomorphism Φ intertwines σ and the representation c:

[formula]

and this equivalence restricts to an equivalence between Banach space representations.

Let U,V be a pair of unit vectors in [formula]. There exists a unique pair of unit vectors S,T in L1(H) such that

[formula]

We can write U = Φ(S) and V = Φ(T) for a unique pair S,T∈L1(H) of unit vectors because Φ is an isomorphim of Banach spaces. Furthermore, because Φ is an isomorphism of Hilbert spaces [formula] and L2(H)  ⊃  L1(H) we have

[formula]

Proof of Proposition [\ref=main]

An application of the Banach-Steinhaus theorem

The next proposition is an application of the Banach-Steinhaus theorem. It enables us to prove Implication (4)  ⇒  (1) from Proposition [\ref=main] in the next subsection.

Let [formula] be a multilinear map on a product of Banach spaces. If B is continuous on each variable, then B is continuous.

By induction on r. See [\cite=RS] for the case r = 2.

If G is a locally compact second countable group, we denote by dμ(g) a Borel measure on G which is finite on compact subsets of G.

Let G be a locally compact second countable group. Let π:G  →  U(H) be a unitary representation on a Hilbert space and let [formula]. If for all ξ,η∈H we have [formula], then there exists C > 0 such that for all unit vectors ξ,ξ',η,η'∈H we have [formula]

Let [formula], where Kn is an exhausting sequence of compact subsets of G. Fix η,ξ',η'∈H, and let us define the familiy Tn of continuous linear operators:

[formula]

with 1Kn the characteristic function of Kn.

We have for each ξ∈H:

[formula]

by hypothesis. The Banach-Steinhaus theorem implies that [formula] where [formula] denotes the operator norm. Hence

[formula]

This proves that the multilinear form B:

[formula]

is continuous in ξ. Analogous arguments show that B is continuous on η,ξ' and η'. Proposition [\ref=multi] completes the proof.

Proof of Proposition [\ref=main]

(1)  ⇒  (3) and (2)  ⇒  (4) are obvious. (1)  ⇒  (2) and (3)  ⇒  (4) are clear: take [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

Lemma [formula] and integration complete the proof. Let us prove (4)  ⇒  (1):

Take U,V two unit vectors (for the projective norm) in [formula]. Write [formula] and [formula] with [formula], where [formula] and [formula] are orthonormal families in [formula] and H. We have :

[formula]

Thanks to Proposition [\ref=enfin], there exists C > 0 such that for all [formula]

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

The proof of (2)  ⇒  (3) is similar and left to the reader.

Length functions, quasi-regular representations

Property RD

We shall define property RD for a unitary representation of a locally compact group G.

Assume that [formula] acts properly by isometries on a metric space. Fix a point x∈X, then g  ↦  L(g): = d(g  ·  x,x) defines a length function on G.

We will need the following:

Let G be a locally compact group endowed with a length function L. Let O be a compact subset in G. Then there exists a positive constant C such that

[formula]

for all g in G and for all x in O.

Triangle inequality imply that for all g,x∈G

[formula]

Since L is locally bounded, we have for all x in O

[formula]

where [formula]

Assume K is a symmetric relatively compact generating set of G containing the identity. Then [formula] is a length function on G. Let [formula]. If L' is any length function on G, then L'(g)  ≤  CL(g). Hence if π has rapid decay with respect to L' then it has rapid decay with respect to L.

Representations associated to measurable actions

Let G be a locally compact group acting measurably on a measured space [formula] where m is a G-quasi-invariant measure. The action is measurable in the sense that: the map

[formula]

is measurable. For all g∈G we denote by g*m the measure which verifies for all Borel subsets A  ⊂  X

[formula]

We say that m is G-quasi-invariant if for all g∈G, m and g*m are in the same measure class. We say that m is G-invariant if for all g∈G, g*m = m. We denote by

[formula]

the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the measure g*m with respect to m. It verifies

[formula]

In this situation, consider the Hilbert space L2(X,m), and define the unitary representation πα:G  →  U(L2(X,m)) as

[formula]

Quasi-regular representations

Quasi-regular representations associated to a pair (G,H) where H is a closed subgroup of G provide examples of unitary representations associated to a measurable action. But first of all, we recall what is the measure class we consider on G / H.

A measure class on G / H

Let G be a locally compact group with a Haar measure dg, and let H be a closed subgroup of G with a Haar measure dh. The space G / H is endowed with its quotient topology. Consider its Borel σ-algebra. We shall define a Borel measure on G / H. Let ΔG and ΔH be the modular functions of G and H. A rho-function for the pair (G,H) is a continuous map [formula] satisfying for all g∈G and for all h∈H

[formula]

It always exists, see [\cite=Fo] or [\cite=Re]. Therefore, given a rho-function for the pair (G,H), there exists a quasi-invariant regular Borel measure on G / H denoted by ν such that for all f∈Cc(G),

[formula]

with Radon-Nikodym

[formula]

for all g,x∈G. See [\cite=Be]. The quasi-regular representation associated to a pair to (G,H) is the unitary representation λG / H:G  →  U(L2(G / H,ν)) defined as

[formula]

for all ξ∈L2(G / H,ν), for all g∈G and for all xH∈G / H.

A particular class of quasi-regular representations

Let G be a locally compact group which is unimodular, and assume that there exists a compact subgroup K and a closed subgroup P of G such that

[formula]

We shall define a rho- function. We denote by ΔP the right-modular function of P. We extend to G the map ΔP of P as [formula] with Δ(g) = Δ(kp): = ΔP(p). It is well defined because [formula] is compact (observe that [formula]). Notice that for all g∈G and for all p∈P, Δ(gp) = Δ(g)Δ(p) = Δ(g)ΔP(p). Hence the function

[formula]

defines a ρ function. Observe also that

[formula]

is well defined. The quotient G / P carries a unique G-quasi-invariant measure ν, such that the Radon-Nikodym derivative at (g,x)∈G  ×  G / P denoted by [formula] satisfies

[formula]

for all g∈G and x∈G / P. Consider the quasi-regular representation λG / P:G  →  U(L2(G / P)) associated to P, defined as

[formula]

We denote by 1G / P the characteristic function of G / P.

As λG / P is a unitary representation, we have Ξ(g) = Ξ(g- 1) for all g∈G. Observe also that for all k,k'∈K we have Ξ(kgk') = Ξ(g).

Stability of some matrix coefficients

Let Γ be a discrete subgroup of a locally compact group G. Let π:G  →  U(H) be a unitary representation. A matrix coefficient, [formula] is stable on G relative to Γ if there exists a relatively compact neighborhood V of the neutral element e∈G and C,c > 0 such that

[formula]

for all g∈V and for all γ∈Γ.

The interest of stable matrix coefficients is illustrated by the following proposition:

Let Γ be a discrete subgroup of a locally compact group G. Let π:G  →  U(H) be a unitary representation, and let L be a length function on G. Let ξ and η be in H. If [formula] is a stable coefficient relative to Γ, then there exists a constant C  ≥  1 such that for all d  ≥  1 we have:

[formula]

Let V be a relatively compact neighborhood of the neutral element of G, such that [formula] for all γ,γ'∈Γ such that γ  ≠  γ'. Consider a matrix coefficient [formula] which is stable relative to Γ. We have

[formula]

for some positive constant c' depending on V and on the constant of Lemma [\ref=fonctionlong].

Let η be in L2+(G / P). The matrix coefficient [formula] is stable relative to every discrete subgroup of G.

Let V be a relatively compact neighborhood of e in G, sufficiently small so that [formula] for all γ  ≠  γ'∈Γ a discrete subrgoup of G. We have [formula] That is

[formula]

The function [formula] is a strictly positive continuous function. Therefore, as [formula] and G / P are compact, there exist C,c > 0 such that for all [formula] and for all x∈G / P, we have

[formula]

Notice that λG / P is a positive representation. Therefore, since η is in L2+(G / P), we obtain for all γ∈Γ, for all g∈V

[formula]

We obtain immediately that the Harish-Chandra function is stable to every discrete subgroup of G:

Combining Corollary [\ref=stable] with Lemma [\ref=l1], we obtain the following:

Let G be a locally compact group decomposed as G = KP where K is a compact subgroup and P is a closed subgroup. Let Γ be a discrete subgroup of G and let L be a length function on G. There exists a constant C > 0 such that for all d  ≥  1 we have

[formula]

The representation [formula] introduced in Subsection [\ref=repre] satisfies for all ξ,η∈H:

[formula]

The representation σ can be used to give a short and elementary proof of the following result, due to C. Herz.

([\cite=He], C. Herz.) Let G be a connected semisimple Lie group with finite center. Then G has property RD with respect to a length function associated to a left-invariant Riemannian metric on G.

See [\cite=He],[\cite=C],[\cite=Boy] for proofs.

We can now easily prove Proposition [\ref=uncoef]:

Consider the quasi-regular representation λG / P associated to P a minimal parabolic subgroup of G. In [\cite=Boy], we prove that this representation satifies property RD w.r.t. L where L is associated to a left-invariant Riemannian metric. Hence, there exist C > 0 and [formula] such that for all ξ,η∈L2(G / P) we have

[formula]

Applying the above inequality for ξ = 1G / P and η∈L2+(G / P), and using Lemma [\ref=stable'] and Lemma [\ref=l1] we obtain for some C > 0 and for the same d  ≥  1, that for all η∈L2+(G / P)

[formula]

Proofs

Proof of Proposition [\ref=propositiv]

We start by a lemma about positive representations.

Let G be a locally compact second countable group with a length function L. Let π:G  →  U(H) be a unitary representation with H = L2(X,m) where (X,m) is a measured space. Assume that π is positive (π preserves the cone of positive functions). The following assertions are equivalent.

There exists [formula] such that for all vectors ξ,η∈H we have

[formula]

There exists [formula] such that for all ξ∈H+ we have

[formula]

(1)  ⇒  (2) is obvious.

Let us prove (2)  ⇒  (1). Observe first that the decomposition of a real valued function ξ into its positive and negative part satisifes |ξ+  -  ξ-|  ≤  ξ+  +  ξ-. By positivity of π, for all g∈G we have π(g)|ξ+  -  ξ-|  ≤  π(g)ξ+  +  π(g)ξ-. Using the decomposition of a complex valued function into its real and imaginary parts, and the decomposition of a real valued function into its positive and negative parts, we obtain, according to the above observation, that [formula] is less than or equal to a linear combination of matrix coefficients [formula] with ξ',η' positive vectors in H. Now observe that for positive vectors,

[formula]

Integration and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality complete the proof.

We Proposition [\ref=propositiv]:

(1)  ⇒  (2) is clear. (2)  ⇒  (1). Thanks to the equivalence between (2) and (4) in Proposition [\ref=main] with [formula] for some d  ≥  1, it is enough to prove that there exists d  ≥  1, such that for each pair of vectors ξ,η∈H we have

[formula]

According to Lemma [formula] it is equivalent to prove that there exists d  ≥  1 such that for any positive function ξ∈L2(X,m) we have

[formula]

We give a proof by contraposition.

Assume that for each [formula], there exists a unit positive vector ξn such that

[formula]

Take a sequence [formula] of strictly positive real numbers such that the series [formula] converges. We consider

[formula]

which is a well defined element of H. We can assume that ξ  ≠  0. We can replace ξ by [formula] which is a unit vector, so we assume that ξ is a unit vector. Let d be a positive real number. Let n be an integer such that n  ≥  d. Notice that [formula] for all [formula] and for all g in G. Hence,

[formula]

Finally we have fund a unit vector ξ, such that for all d  ≥  1 we have

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

We start by an obvious but useful lemma about positive vectors.

Let [formula] be a measurable action of a locally compact group G on a σ-finite measured space with a G-quasi-invariant measure m. The representation πα:G  →  U(L2(X,m)) has a positive vector.

Consider the characteristic function 1A of A a measurable subset set of X such that m(A) <   ∞  . The function 1A is non zero vector of L2(X,m), and it is clear that for all g∈G we have

[formula]

We prove Theorem [\ref=main]

According to Proposition [\ref=propositiv], it is enough to show that πα does not satisfy property RD w.r.t. L. Suppose πα has property RD w.r.t. L; we will find a contradiction. Let [formula] be a subgroup of exponential growth w.r.t. L. The restriction [formula] of πα to [formula] would satisfy property RD w.r.t. L. Hence, according to [\cite=S] the left regular representation [formula] would have property RD w.r.t. L because of Lemma [\ref=vecteurspositifs]. This is impossible because an amenable group can satisfy property RD w.r.t. L if and only if it is a group of polynomial growth w.r.t. L (see [\cite=Jo] ).

Examples of representations associated to group actions without non zero invariant vectors

Measure preserving ergodic group actions on infinite measured space

Let G be locally compact group group acting ergodically on a σ-finite measured space via [formula]. If [formula] has an invariant vector ξ, there exists a measurable function [formula] with [formula], which is G-invariant and satisfying [formula] almost everywhere w.r.t. m (see [\cite=Zi]). Since the action is ergodic, [formula] is a constant function on a conull set. Hence, if m is an infinite G-invariant measure then [formula] does not contain non zero invariant vectors.

Nonsingular ergodic group actions of type III1

Let Γ be a discrete countable group. A nonsingular action [formula] of Γ is an action of Γ on the measured space (X,m) such that m is a Γ-quasi-invariant measure such that there is no Γ-invariant measures in the measure class of m. In the context of operator algebras we say that the equivalence relation produced by [formula] is of type III. There exist different types of equivalence relation of type III (see [\cite=Ta]). We consider only the type III1 case.

Consider the Maharam extension (see [\cite=Ma]) [formula] where Γ acts by measure preserving transformations in the following way

[formula]

We denote by

[formula]

the unitary representation associated to the Maharam extension. It is well known that if [formula] is of type III1 then the action [formula] is ergodic. See [\cite=Ko] for a survey about the type III case. We have

If [formula] is of type III1 then πα does not have non zero invariant vectors.

Assume that πα has an invariant vector. There exists a measurable function ξ such that for all γ in Γ, πα(γ)ξ(x) = ξ(x) almost everywhere w.r.t. m. We shall prove that ξ represents the null vector. Consider the function

[formula]

Observe that ρα(γ)F(x,t) = F(x,t) almost everywhere w.r.t. [formula]. There exists a measurable function [formula] satisfying [formula] almost everywhere w.r.t. [formula], such that [formula] is a Γ-invariant function (see [\cite=Zi]). Since the action [formula] is ergodic, [formula] is a constant function on a conull set of [formula]. Hence ξ is a constant function on a conull set of X. Therefore ξ = 0 almost everywhere w.r.t. m (otherwise [formula] almost everywhere which is excluded by hypothesis).

Quasi-regular representation associated to a closed subgroup of a simple Lie group

Let G be a connected non-compact simple Lie group. Let H be a closed subgroup of G such that G / H carries no finite G-invariant measure. Let Γ be a lattice of G. Then the unitary representation [formula] does not contain non zero invariant vectors.

Consider the quasi-regular representation [formula] associated to H. the representation λG / H can be identified with the induced representation IndGH(1H) of G associated to the trivial representation of H, see [\cite=Be]. It is well known that IndGH(1H) has a non zero invariant vector if and only if G / H carries a finite invariant regular Borel measure ([\cite=Be]). Hence λG / H does not contain non zero invariant vectors. Combining this observation with Moore's Theorem [\cite=Zi] we obtain that λG  /  H|Γ does not contain non zero invariant vectors.

Proof of Corollary [\ref=coro1]

We give a proof of Corollary [\ref=coro1]:

It is known that Γ as in the corollary contains a cyclic subgroup with exponential growth w.r.t. any left-invariant Riemannian metric on G. See [\cite=Lu] for the higher rank case. The rank 1 one case is well known: horospherical subgroups of Γ have exponential growth with respect to any left-invariant Riemannian metric).

Proof of Corollary [\ref=coro2]

Let G be a non compact semisimple Lie group endowed with a length function L associated to a left-invariant Riemannian metric. Let H be a closed subgroup of G. Let [formula] be the quasi-regular representation associated to H. Let u∈G be a unipotent element of infinite order. Let [formula] be the cyclic subgroup generated by u. Observe that [formula] is discrete and is an amenable group with exponential growth w.r.t. L. Thus it can not satisfy property RD w.r.t. L by [\cite=Jo]. Since [formula] has a positive vector by Lemma [\ref=existpo], according to Shalom's Lemma, [\cite=S], [formula] does not satisfy property RD w.r.t. L. Thanks to Proposition [\ref=propositiv] (2) applied to [formula], there exists ξ∈L2(G / H)+ such that for all d  ≥  1 we have

[formula]

We claim that the weak inequality fails for the coefficient [formula]. Assume on the contrary that it holds. There would exist Cξ and dξ such that for all g∈G [formula]. For any d0 > 0, we would have:

[formula]

where the last inequality follows from Proposition [\ref=hcdiscret].

Since G is a semisimple Lie group, we can find d0 > 1 such that

[formula]

see [\cite=GV] for a reference. It would follow that

[formula]

This is a contradiction.
