Spectroscopic parameters of phosphine, PH3, in its ground vibrational state

Introduction

Phosphine, PH3, was detected as a trace constituent of the atmospheres of the giant planets Jupiter [\cite=PH3-Jupiter_1976] and Saturn [\cite=PH3-Saturn_1977], respectively by infrared spectroscopy. Observations of the lowest J  =  1  -  0 rotational transition near 267 GHz toward Jupiter [\cite=Jupiter_J=1-0_1984] and Saturn [\cite=Saturn_J=1-0_1994] were also reported. Using a far- and mid-infrared (FIR and MIR) spectrometer on board of the Cassini satellite, it was even possible to study the meridional PH3 distribution in Saturn's upper troposphere [\cite=Saturn_Cassini_2007]. Higher resolution FIR observations of Saturn's atmosphere were carried out very recently with the Herschel satellite, and the vertical distribution of PH3 was derived [\cite=Saturn_Herschel_2012]. Phosphine is also a likely species to occur in the atmospheres of giant extrasolar planets or of brown dwarfs [\cite=opacities4brown-dwarfs_etc_2007]. Moreover, it has been tentatively detected in the circumstellar shells of carbon-rich late-type stars CW Leonis [\cite=tent_det_IRC1_2008] [\cite=tent_det_IRC2_2008], also known as IRC +10216, and V1610 Cygni, also known as CRL 2688, by radio-astronomical observations of the J  =  1  -  0 transition.

Small molecules, and even more so light hydride species, such as PH3, are also of great interest for basic science. In the early years, an important questions was if PH3 would display measureable inversion splitting as its lighter homolog ammonia, NH3, does [\cite=NH3-inversion_1932a] [\cite=NH3-inversion_1932b].

Early reports on the ground state rotational spectrum of PH3 were published by the Gordy group [\cite=PH3_rot_1954] [\cite=PH3_rot_1969]. Burrus [\cite=PH3_Stark_1958] determined the dipole moment from Stark measurements. Davies et al. [\cite=PH3_RF_1971] studied transitions between A1 and A2 levels with ΔJ  =  ΔK  =  0 at radio-frequencies (RF). They were unable to resolve any tunneling splitting, but obtained hyperfine structure parameters caused by the 31P and 1H nuclei and an improved value for the dipole moment. Chu and Oka recorded ΔK  =  3 transitions with ΔJ  =  0 and [formula] and estimated an effective value for the centrifugal distortion induced dipole moment from intensity measurements [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1974]. Later, corresponding transitions were reported for K  =  0  -  3 [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1977], K  =  2  -  5 [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1981a], and K  =  3  -  6 [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1981b]. Regular rotational transitions with ΔJ  =  1 and ΔK  =  0 in the millimeter and submillimeter regions [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1981a] [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1981b] and in the far-infrared (FIR) region [\cite=PH3_rot_FIR_1988] were also studied.

Recently, Cazzoli and Puzzarini [\cite=PH3_rot_Lamb-Dip_2006] obtained very accurate transition frequencies for the J  =  1  -  0 and 2  -  1 transitions employing sub-Doppler (Lamb-dip) spectroscopy, which resolved 31P and 1H hyperfine structure, and for the J  =  3  -  2 transitions using conventional absorption spectroscopy. As this study employed in their fit very limited data beyond their own, a combined fit of these data together with previous results has been carried out here to obtain an improved set of spectroscopic parameters which should be useful not only for spectroscopic observations of phosphine in planetary atmospheres, brown dwarfs, or other regions in space, but also for future analyses of rovibrational spectra or as benchmarks for quantum-chemical calculations.

Spectral analysis and discussion

Phosphine is an oblate rotor with a permanent dipole moment of 0.57395 (3) D [\cite=PH3_RF_1971]. It is moderately close to the spherical rotor limit with γ  =  (C0  -  B0) / A0  =   - 0.1361 being small in magnitude, but not particularly so.

The rotational energies and transitions of a strongly oblate rotor in its ground vibrational state and without A1/A2 splitting require for their modeling only C  -  B and B along with distortion parameters, DJ, DJK, and DK to lowest order. In a strongly prolate rotor, C is replaced with A. The purely axial parameters C  -  B, DK, etc. can usually not be determined by rotational spectroscopy. Their determination requires, e.g., the observation of centrifugal distortion induced ΔK  =  3 transitions. The A1/A2 splitting is modeled to lowest order by h3(J6+  +  J6-) with J±  =  Jx  ±  iJy. J and K distortion corrections and possibly even higher order terms may be required in the fit. Early treatments of the rotational spectrum of PH3 used parameters as described above to fit the rotational transitions. However, it was recognized early on that the parameter derived for h3 was too large by about a factor of 4 [\cite=PH3_RF_1971]. Moreover, it was found later, that the Hamiltonian converged rather slowly [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1981b].

Tarrago and Dang Nhu [\cite=PH3_analysis_1985] discussed the formulation of the Hamiltonian for symmetric top molecules approaching the spheric rotor limit employing the examples OPF3 and PH3. They pointed out that for such molecules not only the ΔK  =  6 terms derived from h3, also called f6 in their work, affect the A1/A2 splitting, but also terms with ΔK  =  3, whose lowest order term is ε, which is also called q3. The parameter ε is the coefficient of +, were +  =  AB  +  BA is the anticommutator of A and B. They presented one fit with parameters derived from h3, and one fit with parameters derived from ε and h3. The latter fit was slightly better, but yielded a value for h3 only slightly smaller than in the fit without ε, meaning that their value was still too lage by almost a factor of 4. Moreover, their value for ε was too small by about a factor of 3. Interestingly, they did not attempt any fits without parameters derived from h3.

Fusina and Carlotti recorded the FIR spectrum of PH3 and made assignments for the ground vibrational state between 44 and 202 cm- 1 with J'' between 4 and 22 and K between 19 and 0 [\cite=PH3_rot_FIR_1988]. They used in their fits their own data together with previous data from Refs. [\cite=PH3_rot_1969] [\cite=PH3_RF_1971] [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1974] [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1977] [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1981a] [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1981b]. Three different fits were presented which included parameters derived from both ε and h3 as well as parameters derived either from ε or h3. The parameters ε and h3 were completely correlated if both were used. The parameters h3 and h3K were completely correlated in the fit without parameters derived from ε. In contrast, the fit with only parameters derived from ε did not produce severe correlations, yielded the best standard deviation, but employed two more parameters than the other two fits. This fit was their preferred one.

The fits carried out in the course of the present investigation employed Herb Pickett's SPFIT and SPCAT programs [\cite=Pickett_1991]. They started from the preferred parameters from Fusina and Carlotti [\cite=PH3_rot_FIR_1988] and the hyperfine parameters employed by Cazzoli and Puzzarini [\cite=PH3_rot_Lamb-Dip_2006] using transition frequencies from Refs. [\cite=PH3_RF_1971] [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1974] [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1977] [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1981a] [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1981b] [\cite=PH3_rot_FIR_1988] [\cite=PH3_rot_Lamb-Dip_2006] with uncertainties as reported. The RF transitions [\cite=PH3_RF_1971] were reportedly accurate to between 0.1 and 0.2 kHz. Initially, 0.2 kHz were used in the fits because the published deviations from the measured frequencies exceeded 0.6 kHz in two cases. However, the transitions were reproduced in the present fits to well within 0.1 kHz on average with no severe outliers. Therefore, 0.1 kHz uncertainties were employed for these data in the final fits. The uncertainties of Ref. [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1981a] were used as reported in Ref. [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1981b]. Including LJJK in the fit, which was contrained to zero in Ref. [\cite=PH3_rot_FIR_1988], yielded a reasonable value, and suggested the parameters εK, εJK, and εKK to be indeterminate. The latter three parameters could be omitted from the fit without significant deterioration of the fit. The resulting parameters, including those for the hyperfine structure, are given in Table [\ref=parameters] under heading "Present, alternative".

Hyperfine structure caused by the 31P and 1H nuclei was resolved in the RF spectra [\cite=PH3_RF_1971] and in the Lamb-dip measurements from Ref. [\cite=PH3_rot_Lamb-Dip_2006]. The hyperfine Hamiltonian was described in sufficient detail e.g. in the latter work. As mentioned in that work, the Lamb-dip measurements were rather sensitive to the perpendicular components CN of the P and H nuclear spin-rotation tensors, which are also known as [formula], and to the axial components D1(P-  H) and D3(H-  H) of the spin-spin coupling tensors, which are also known as [formula](P-  H) and [formula](H-  H), respectively. They were not as sensitive to the axial components CK of the nuclear spin-rotation tensor, which are also known as [formula], and to the perpendicular component D2(P-  H) of the P-  H spin-spin coupling tensor, also known as [formula](P-  H). In contrast, the RF data were sensitive to CN and CK of both nuclei, but not as sensitive to the spin-spin coupling tensors. In the present fit, D2 could still not be determined significantly and with confidence. However, its omission increased the standard deviation of the fit somewhat. Therefore, it was retained in the fit kept fixed to the calculated value from Ref. [\cite=PH3_rot_Lamb-Dip_2006]. Other parameters, such as C-(H), the off-diagonal H spin-rotation parameter, the scalar spin-spin coupling parameters, or distortion corrections to the P or H nuclear spin-rotation parameters were not determined with significance, and their inclusion had a negligible effect on the quality of the fit. Therefore, they were omitted from the final fits.

As can be seen in Table [\ref=parameters], the present hyperfine parameters are in good to very good agreement with previously determined ones [\cite=PH3_RF_1971] [\cite=PH3_rot_Lamb-Dip_2006], but have much smaller uncertainties in the present fits. The values of the spin-spin coupling parameters - 3D1 and 1.5D3 agree very well with the calculated ones of 3.18 kHz and 20.7 kHz, respectively. In fact, keeping the spin-spin coupling parameters fixed to the calculated values, does not deteriorate the quality of the fit significantly. In addition, the values of the other parameters and, somewhat surprisingly, even their uncertainties are affected negligibly.

The remaining spectroscopic parameters agree for the most part well with the preferred ones from Fusina and Carlotti [\cite=PH3_rot_FIR_1988] as far as they were determined in both fits. Exceptions are the two octic distortion parameters LJK and LKKJ, which is a result of the omission of LJJK by Fusina and Carlotti and of the omission of some higher order distortion corrections to ε in the present fits. Notably, the values of ε agree quite well, about 832 kHz versus 829 kHz. Both values, however, are slightly larger than 723 kHz calculated by Tarrago and Dang Nhu [\cite=PH3_analysis_1985] and 773 kHz calculated by Fusina and Carlotti [\cite=PH3_rot_FIR_1988]. The parameter ε and its distortion corrections cause ΔK  =  3 transitions, among others, to have non-zero intensities very similar to those calculated without these parameters, but with the effective centrifugal distortion correction to the permanent dipole moment mentioned in Ref. [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1974]. Therefore, another fit has been carried out with h3 kept fixed at the value of 11.3 Hz calculated in Ref. [\cite=PH3_analysis_1985]. The ε value of 714.5 kHz resulting from this fit is very close to the one calculated by Tarrago and Dang Nhu [\cite=PH3_analysis_1985], but somewhat smaller than the one from Fusina and Carlotti [\cite=PH3_rot_FIR_1988]. All other parameters are also affected in their magnitudes. This fit is considered to be the preferred one. The effects on the intensities of the ΔK  =  3 transitions correspond closely to the square of the ratios of the ε values, the intensities of all other transitions change only marginally between the two data sets.

The quality of the preferred fit and of the alternative fit are identical. The experimental transition frequencies have been reproduced within the reported uncertainties on average, the rms error is 0.93, slightly better than the ideal 1.0. There is some scatter among the rms errors of individual data sets: it is 0.77 for the RF data [\cite=PH3_RF_1971] and 0.64 [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1974], 0.87 [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1977], and 0.94 [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1981a] [\cite=PH3_rot_DelK=3_1981b] for the older millimeter and submillimeter data. The FIR data from Fusina and Carlotti [\cite=PH3_rot_FIR_1988] were given uncertainties of 0.0001 cm- 1 throughout, as suggested by the authors, even though the residuals increased somewhat for the transitions with the highest two J values. Two transitions omitted already by Fusina and Carlotti were also omitted here. In addition, the frequency of the transition with J''  =  16 and K  =  9 was omitted as its residual exceeded 4σ. The rms error of the FIR transitions was 0.94; the frequencies of 4 transitions, all at higher J values, had residuals larger than 3σ, which is reasonably close to the statistical expectations in the case of 230 different transition frequencies. An rms error of 1.37 was obtained for the data from Ref. [\cite=PH3_rot_Lamb-Dip_2006]. Even though this suggests slightly optimistic uncertainty estimates, no adjustments were made, as one frequency, 533815.1259 (10) MHz, contributed particularly to the rms error. Omission of this line reduced the rms error of this data set to slightly below 1.1. In addition, the omission of this line from the overall line list affected all parameters within experimental uncertainties. Therefore, this line was retained in the final fit.

The J-dependent parameters, in particular the ones dependent purely on J have much smaller uncertainties in the present fits compared to the preferred fit of Fusina and Carlotti [\cite=PH3_rot_FIR_1988]. This is hardly surprising given the nature of the new data from Ref. [\cite=PH3_rot_Lamb-Dip_2006]. The uncertainties of DK and HK here are actually slightly larger than from the FIR fit. This may be caused by differences in the correlation of the parameters or by differences in the weighting scheme.

Predictions of the rotational spectrum were made for the Cologne Database for Molecular Spectroscopy, CDMS [\cite=CDMS_1] [\cite=CDMS_2], using the parameters of the preferred fit. The upper quantum numbers were J  =  40 and K  =  38, ensuring convergence of the rotational part of the partition function to 10- 4 up to 500 K. The intensity cut-offs were chosen to include all experimental ΔJ  =  ΔK  =  0 transitions between A1 and A2 levels on one hand and to limit the number of transitions with uncertainties equal to or larger than 1 GHz, as SPCAT displays such uncertainties as 999.9999 MHz or 0.0334 cm- 1. This leads to transitions with upper J and K of 34 and 31, respectively. The K  =  0 transition with J  =  8  -  7 is the most intense transition at 300 K. At 500 K and 1000 K, the corresponding transition with J  =  11  -  10 and J  =  14  -  14, respectively, is the most intense one. With phosphine being only a minor constituent in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn, the current predictions should therefore contain sufficient ground state rotational transitions not only at 300 K, but also, after appropriate conversion of the intensities, for 500 K and likely for 1000 K. However, the neglect of rotational transitions in excited vibrational states may cause non-negligible errors already around 300 K, as can be seen below.

Intensities of the transitions with ΔK  =  3 should be viewed with some caution as indicated above. Predictions of transition frequencies with ΔK  =  0 should be reliable as long as the predicted uncertainties do not exceed 5 MHz. Predictions of transition frequencies with [formula] should be viewed with caution if the predicted uncertainties are larger than 0.5 MHz. In these cases, the actual frequencies may differ from the predictions by more than five times the predicted uncertainties.

The partition function values given in the documentation of the CDMS entry do not include vibrational contributions; they are about 2.4 % at 300 K and amount to about 18.5 % at 500 K. Classically estimated vibrational contributions are intended to be provided through a link in the documentation file. It should be mentioned that the HITRAN entry takes into account vibrational contributions to the partition function. Moreover, the intensities at 300 K have been converted to those at 296 K, which is the default temperature in HITRAN.

Pickett's SPFIT and SPCAT programs [\cite=Pickett_1991] use the total parity. This parity is therefore also used in the ASCII table version of the PH3 entry in the CDMS. It differs both from the A1/A2 parity as well as from the A+/A- parity. A levels with -   parity belong to A2 for even K and to A1 for odd K. A levels with -   parity belong to A- for J  +  K even and to A+ for J  +  K odd. Additional confusion may occur because the +   sign has been omitted, and transitions with rounded A1/A2 splitting of less than 0.1 kHz have been merged. These transitions are thus between two A levels without parity designation. Moreover, since only 2 characters are available for each quantum number, K values ≥  10 with negative parity are indicated by lower case characters; e.g. a2, a5, a8, and b1 are used for - 12, - 15, - 18, and - 21, respectively. The entry in HITRAN provides their common parity labels. It should be also mentioned that a process is under way to create a database version of the CDMS within the framework of the Virtual Atomic and Molecular Data Centre (VAMDC) [\cite=VAMDC_2010]. The official release of a test version is still pending because very many entries need to be imported properly, and in many cases necessary auxiliary files need to be created. One of the goals of VAMDC is providing easily interpretable quantum numbers.

Fairly recently, dipole moment and potential energy surfaces were reported, and selected ground state rotational energies have been provided [\cite=PH3_PES_2006]. The deviations between their energies and the present ones are fairly small. They drop at J  =  10 from 0.9164 cm- 1 for K  =  0 to 0.4720 cm- 1 for K  =  9. The deviations are larger at J  =  20, where they drop from 3.4312 cm- 1 for K  =  0 to 2.9680 cm- 1 for K  =  9. Because of the extent of the experimental data, these deviations are probably predominantly due to insufficiencies in the calculated potential energy surface.

More recently, a very extensive and very accurate line list has been created for PH3 [\cite=PH3_line_list_2013]. The authors found a remarkably good agreement between their transition frequencies and the ones in the first CDMS entry which had been created in October 2008 and which has been recalculated in February of 2013 by lowering the intensity cut-offs to provide weaker transition frequencies which in part access higher quantum numbers. These predictions correspond essentially to the ones derived from the alternative fit in the present work. The authors mentioned that the deviations are below 0.003 cm- 1 for the strongest 100 transitions [\cite=PH3_line_list_2013]. As these transitions involve J values between 3 and 14 and K values from 0 to 9, which are all covered by experimental data, the deviations are probably again predominantly due to insufficiencies in the calculated potential energy surface. Moreover, differences in the predicted frequencies generated from the preferred fot or the alternative fit are very small for these transitions. Even more remarkable are the deviations at low quantum numbers. The JK  =  10  -  00 prediction from Ref. [\cite=PH3_line_list_2013] is only 2.8 MHz lower than the experimental frequency as well as the frequency calculated from either present fit. The deviations decrease first with increasing J, until the frequency of the 80  -  70 transition is actually higher than the one predicted from the preferred fit. Similarly, the [formula] transition frequency from Ref. [\cite=PH3_line_list_2013] is only 3.6 MHz lower than the one predicted from the preferred fit. Again, the deviations decrease first for increasing J until the [formula] transition frequency is higher in frequency. The agreement is still rather good if all transitions from the previous CDMS predictions are compared with those from Ref. [\cite=PH3_line_list_2013]; the authors give an rms value of 0.076 cm- 1. Because of the limitations in the experimental data as well as in the Hamiltonian model, it may well be that the predicted transition frequencies from the present study are eventually less reliable that those from Ref. [\cite=PH3_line_list_2013].

The intensities from Ref. [\cite=PH3_line_list_2013] agree very well with either prediction from the present fits for ΔK  =  0 transitions. The value for μ2 from the former work is 3.9 % larger than the experimental value from Ref. [\cite=PH3_RF_1971]; this deviation is almost canceled by the neglect of the vibrational contributions to the partition function at 300 K in the present work. However, there are larger deviations between the calculated intensities of ΔK  =  3 transitions; e.g., the intensity of the [formula] transition from Ref. [\cite=PH3_line_list_2013] is a factor of 1.85 weaker than the intensity from predictions generated from the preferred fit; it is even weaker by a factor of 2.5 if predictions generated from the alternative fit are used. Possible explanations for these deviations are insufficiencies in the calculations from Ref. [\cite=PH3_line_list_2013], insufficiencies in the preferred Hamiltonian model, e.g. εK had to be constrained to zero, or the neglect of distortion corrections to the electric dipole moment. It may well be that each of these explanations is responsible in part.

Conclusion
