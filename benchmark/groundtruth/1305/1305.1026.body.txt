Hurwitz-Hodge integral identities from the cut-and-join equation

Introduction

The Gromov-Witten theory for symplectic orbifolds has been developed by Chen-Ruan [\cite=CR]. The algebraic part, the Gromov-Witten theory for smooth DM stacks, was established by Abramovich-Graber-Vistoli [\cite=AGV]. By the virtual localization, all the orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants for a toric DM stack descend to the computation of the Hurwitz-Hodge integrals on the moduli space [formula] of twisted stable maps to the classifying stack of a finite group G [\cite=Liu]. In [\cite=Zhou1], J. Zhou described an effective algorithm to calculate the Hurwitz-Hodge integrals. By applying Tseng's orbifold quantum Riemann-Roch theorem [\cite=Tseng], Hurwitz-Hodge integrals can be reconstructed from the descendant Hurwitz-Hodge integrals on [formula].

Recall that the descendant Hodge integrals on moduli space of curves can be computed by the DVV recursion which is equivalent to the Witten-Kontsevich theorem [\cite=Witten] [\cite=Ko]. An easy approach to DVV recursion is by studying the cut-and-join equation for simple Hurwitz numbers. Combining the famous ELSV formula, one can obtain a polynomial identity for linear Hodge integrals. Then it is direct to derive the DVV recursion by looking at the highest terms in this identity [\cite=CLL] [\cite=MZ]. Similarly, collecting the lowest terms, one obtains a formula for λg-integrals [\cite=GJV] [\cite=Zhu1].

In [\cite=JPT], Johnson-Pandharipande-Tseng established the ELSV-type formula for orbifold Hurwitz numbers which also satisfy the cut-and-join equation. With the same technique used in [\cite=EMS], Bouchard-Serrano-Liu-Mulase [\cite=BSLM] established the Laplace transform of the cut-and-join equation for orbifold Hurwtiz numbers. Starting from this formula, with the same method used in [\cite=GJV] [\cite=CLL] [\cite=Zhu2] [\cite=MZ], we obtain the following Hurwtiz-Hodge integrals identities.

When r  ≥  1 and 0  ≤  ki  ≤  r - 1, for 1  ≤  i  ≤  l, the Hurwitz-Hodge integrals satisfies the following orbifold-DVV recursion:

[formula]

Where the constant Ck1,kjb1,bj can be calculated from the formula (37) in Lemma 3.2. We have not written down an explicit formula for it in general. However, when r = 1, then ki = 0, for i = 1,..,l. It is easy to compute

[formula]

Therefore, we have

When r = 1, the orbifold-DVV recursion is reduced to the ordinary DVV recursion which is equivalent to the original Witten conjecture.

[formula]

The rank of the Hodge bundle [formula] (see Section 2 for the detail definition) on [formula] depends on the monodories at the marking points. When all the monodories are trivial, [formula]. Otherwise, the rank is given by formula (19). By looking at the lowest terms in the formula (36), we obtain the following theorem.

When all the monodromies at the marking points are trivial, i.e. ki = 0, for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  l. If bi  ≥  0 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  l, and [formula], we have the following closed formula for λUg-integrals:

[formula]

where the one-point integral 〈τ2g - 2λUg〉rg is determined by the following formula given in [\cite=JPT](See the formula before Section 4):

[formula]

Otherwise, the [formula]-integral satisfies the following identity:

[formula]

where Z  ⊂  L is the index set defined as Z = {i|ki = 0,i∈L}. In particular, when Z is an empty set, both sides of the identity (6) are zero. Moreover, the constants ckm,0 are given in the formula (31): [formula].

As a direct application of the formula (4), we obtain

When bi  ≥  0 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  l, and [formula],

[formula]

where the right hand side is the ordinary Hodge integral on moduli space of curves:

[formula]

The ordinary λg-integral satisfies the following formula which was firstly obtained by Faber-Pandharipande [\cite=FP]

[formula]

where the one-point integral 〈τ2g - 2λg〉g is determined by

[formula]

Hence, by formula (5),

[formula]

Therefore, Corollary 1.4 is derived from the formula (4).

The formula (7) in Corollary 1.4 was first conjectured by J. Zhou [\cite=Zhou3]. We would like to thank Prof. Kefeng Liu and Hao Xu for pointing out it to us.

Preliminaries

Hurwitz-Hodge integrals

Let [formula] be the moduli space of stable maps to the classifying space [formula] where γ = (γ1,...,γn) is a vector elements in [formula]. In particular, when a = 1, the moduli space of stable maps [formula] is specialized to [formula]. Let U be the irreducible [formula]-representation of [formula] given by

[formula]

We have the corresponding Hodge bundle [formula] and the Hodge classes [formula]. More generally, for any irreducible representation R of [formula], we denote the corresponding Hodge bundle and Hodge classes as [formula] and λR,g,γi respectively. In the following, for brevity, we will also use the notations [formula] and λRi to denote the Hodge bundle and Hodge classes without confusion.

The i-th cotangent line bundle Li on the moduli space of curves has fiber Li|(C,p1,...,pn) = T*piC. The ψ-classes on [formula] are defined by

[formula]

The ψ-classes on [formula] are defined by pull-back via the morphism

[formula]

as

[formula]

Hurwitz-Hodge integrals over [formula] are the top intersection products of the classes {λRi} and [formula]:

[formula]

We let

[formula]

where [formula] is the rank of [formula] determined by the orbifold Riemann-Roch formula.

Orbifold ELSV formula

In [\cite=JPT], Johnson-Pandharipande-Tseng established the following ELSV-type formula for orbifold Hurwtiz number Hrg,l(μ1,...,μl).

The orbifold Hurwitz number has an expression in terms of linear Hurwtiz-Hodge integrals as follows:

[formula]

where [formula], μ = (μ1,..,μl) is a partition with length l. The floor and fractional part of a [formula] is denoted by q = ⌊q⌋  +  〈q〉.

The rank of the Hodge bundle [formula] can be calculated by the orbifold Riemann-Roch formula. When all the monodromies are trivial, i.e. [formula], for all i = 1,..,l, the rank of [formula] is g, otherwise, the rank is (see formula (3.17) in [\cite=BSLM]) given by

[formula]

The Laplace transform of the cut-and-join equation for orbifold Hurwitz numbers

The orbifold Hurwitz number H(r)g,l(μ) also satisfies the cut-and-join equation, the following formula was established in Bouchard-Serrano-Liu-Mulase [\cite=BSLM].

(Cut-and-join equation [\cite=BSLM])

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the number of the simple ramification point given by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. The notation î indicates that the parts μi is erased.

In order to describe the Laplace transform of the above cut-and-join formula (20). We need to introduce the auxiliary functions showed in [\cite=BSLM] (see section 7.2) firstly: and for m  ≥   - 1, we let

[formula]

For the following exposition, we also need to fix some notations. let L = (1,..,l) be an index set, we denote bL = (b1,..,bl) with bi  ≥  0, kL = (k1,..,kl) with 0  ≤  ki < r, [formula] and [formula], [formula].

The Hurwitz-Hodge integrals are abbreviated as

[formula]

Now the Laplace transform of the cut-and-join equation can be described as follows (see formula (7.26) in [\cite=BSLM]).

[formula]

Proof of the main results

In this section, we present the proofs for the results showed in Section 1. First, we introduce the new variable t as

[formula]

It is easy to get

[formula]

Hence, in the new variable t, and for m  ≥   - 1, we have

[formula]

For 0  ≤  k  ≤  r - 1, the function ξr,km(t) has the following expansion form:

[formula]

where the coefficients ckm,i, for 0  ≤  i  ≤  m, satisfy certain recursion relations. In particularly, we have

[formula]

By definition, we have

[formula]

So ξr,k1(t) has the expansion form (30) showed in Lemma 3.1, with

[formula]

When m  ≥  1, one has

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

It is direct to obtain the formula (31) by the initial values in formula (33).

In terms of the new auxiliary functions ξr,km(t), the formula (25) can be changed to

[formula]

For 0  ≤  a  ≤  r - 1, we have

[formula]

By a direct calculation, we have

[formula]

Proof of the Theorem 1.1:

When [formula], we consider the coefficient of the monomial

[formula]

in the formula (36). This coefficient in the left hand side is equal to

[formula]

When m = b1 + bj - 1 and [formula], for j = 2,..,l, by Lemma 3.2, we denote the coefficient of the term

[formula]

in the formula (37) as Ck1,kjb1,bj. Then the coefficient in the first term of the right hand side is

[formula]

This coefficient in the second term of the right hand side is

[formula]

Where the coefficient ckibi,bi are given by formula (31). Collecting the formulas (40),(42) and (43) together, we obtain the Theorem 1.1.

Proof of the Theorem 1.3:

Now we consider the lowest nonzero terms in the formula (36). The rank of the Hodge bundle [formula] is g if all the loop monodories are trivial, i.e. ki = 0, for 1  ≤  i  ≤  l. Otherwise, the rank is

[formula]

First, we consider the nontrivial case. So the smallest possible |bL| is

[formula]

where we have used the notation N({kL}) to denote the number of the set {i|ki = 0,1  ≤  i  ≤  l}.

The lowest term of a ξr,km(t) is

[formula]

where [formula]. When [formula], consider the coefficient of the monomial

[formula]

in the formula (36).

This coefficient in the left hand side of (36) is

[formula]

To compute coefficients in the second term of right hand side of (36), first find that range of m,n with nonzero contribution in [formula] is Range of m,n in 〈τmτbIΛ〉r,(a,kI)g1〈τnτbJΛ〉r,(b,kJ)g2 is Hence

[formula]

Since 0  ≤  a,b,ki < r and [formula], it is easy to obtain that [formula] is equal to bi - 1 or bi - 2.

On the other hand, the lowest term of ξr,am + 1(ti)ξr,bn + 1(ti) is Only when ki = 0 and a + b = r, this term contributes a coefficient - 1 to the term

[formula]

Hence, the coefficient of the monomial [formula] in the second term of right hand side is

[formula]

Similarly for the first term of right hand side, range of m is

[formula]

From the formula (37), only when ki,kj = 0 and a = 0 or ki = 0 and a = kj, we take m = bi + bj - 1, then the left hand side of the formula (37) can contribute a coefficient [formula] to the term [formula].

If we define the index set Z  ⊂  L as

[formula]

The coefficient of the monomial [formula] in the first term of right hand side is

[formula]

By using the rank formula (19), it is easy to compute that the ranks appearing in the formulas (48), (56) and (59) satisfy:

[formula]

Finally, combining (48), (56) and (59) together, we obtain the following formula

[formula]

So we have the formula (6) in Theorem 1.3.

As to the trivial monodromies case, i.e. ki = 0, for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  l. We have [formula]. With the analogue analysis as above, when [formula], the coefficients of [formula] at the left hand of formula (36) takes the form

[formula]

While at the right hand side, only the first term has the contribution

[formula]

where the coefficients c0bi,0 is given by formula (31). So we obtain

[formula]

Then by induction, we obtain the formula (4) in Theorem 1.3 .
