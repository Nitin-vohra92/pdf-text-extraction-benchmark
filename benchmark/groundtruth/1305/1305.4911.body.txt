Finiteness of profinite groups with a rational probabilistic zeta function

Introduction

Let G be a finitely generated profinite group. Given an integer [formula], there are only finitely many index n subgroups of G; all of them are open (cf. [\cite=Nikolov]). We define the integer an to be the finite sum [formula] where μG is the Möbius function defined on the lattice of open subgroups of G recursively by μG(G) = 1 and [formula] if H < G. A fruitful approach tool to study the sequence [formula] is its associated Dirichlet series

[formula]

where s is a complex variable. For example, if G =  is the profinite completion of the integers [formula], then it is easy to see that [formula], the inverse of the Riemann zeta function.

If G is a finite group, then for every positive integer t, the value PG(t) is the probability that t randomly chosen elements generate the group G (cf. [\cite=Hall]). In the context of profinite groups, Mann conjectured in [\cite=Mann96] that if G is positively finitely generated, i.e., the probability [formula] that t randomly chosen elements generate G topologically is positive for some positive integer t, then PG(s) converges in some right half-plane and [formula] for [formula] large enough. The conjecture has been verified for several classes of profinite groups (cf. [\cite=Mann05],[\cite=Lu07],[\cite=Lu11b]) and the study of convergency of PG(s) is reduced to the study of subgroup structures of finite almost simple groups (cf. [\cite=Lu10], [\cite=Lu11a]) which has been done for symmetric and alternating groups (cf. [\cite=CL10]). Despite the convergence of PG(s), the reciprocal of PG(s) is usually called the probabilistic zeta function of G (cf. [\cite=Mann96], [\cite=Boston]).

Notice that if μG(H)  ≠  0 then H is an intersection of maximal subgroup (cf. [\cite=Hall]), and thus H contains the Frattini subgroup Φ(G) of G, which is the intersection of the maximal open subgroups of G. Hence the series PG(s) = PG / Φ(G)(s) encodes information about the lattice generated by maximal subgroups of G, just as the Riemann zeta function encodes information about the primes. It is obvious that if Φ(G) is open, i.e., G contains only finitely many maximal subgroups, then there are only finitely many open subgroups H with non-zero Möbius values. Therefore, an = 0 for all but finitely many [formula], and the series PG(s) is a finite series. It is natural to ask whether the converse is still true. It is conjectured in [\cite=DeLu06] that for a finitely generated profinite group G, if the probabilistic zeta function is rational, i.e., a quotient of two finite Dirichlet series, then G / Φ(G) is finite. The conjecture have been confirmed to be true for prosolvable groups (cf. [\cite=DeLu06]) and several classes of non-prosolvable groups (cf. [\cite=DeLu07], [\cite=Dung-Lie], [\cite=Dung-PSL]). A consequence of those results is that if almost every composition factor of G is isomorphic to a given simple group S, then the conjecture holds. The problem becomes quite difficult when one replaces S by a finite set [formula] of finite simple groups, even in the case [formula] is a family of comparable finite simple groups, e.g., finite simple groups of Lie type over arbitrary characteristics. Fortunately, the problem can be solved in [\cite=Dung-PSL] if every simple group in [formula] is [formula] for some prime p  ≥  5. However, the conjecture is still open in general and it is very hard to give an affirmative answer for the conjecture when [formula] contains non-comparable families of finite simple groups. In this paper, using the methods developed in [\cite=Dung-PSL] and [\cite=Dung-Lie], we obtain the following result.

Let G be a finitely generated profinite group and H an open subgroup of G such that every nonabelian composition factor of H is isomorphic to one of the following:

[formula] for some prime p  ≥  5;

a sporadic simple group;

[formula] where n is either a prime or a 2-power.

Then PG(s) is rational only if G contains only finitely many maximal subgroups.

Preliminaries

Let G be a finitely generated profinite group and [formula] a fixed countable descending series of open normal subgroups with the property that G0 = G, [formula] and Gi / Gi + 1 is a chief factor of G / Gi + 1 for each [formula]. In particular, for each [formula], there exist a simple group Si (composition factor) and a positive integer ri (composition length) such that [formula]. It is shown in [\cite=DeLu06b] that PG(s) can be written as an infinite formal product where for each [formula] is the finite Dirichlet series associated to the chief factor Gi / Gi + 1. Moreover, this factorization is independent on the choice of chief series (see [\cite=DeLu03] [\cite=DeLu06b]) and Pi(s) = 1 unless Gi / Gi + 1 is a non-Frattini chief factor of G, i.e., Gi / Gi + 1 is not contained in the Frattini subgroup Φ(G / Gi + 1).

If Si is cyclic of order pi then Pi(s) = 1 - ci / (prii)s where ci is the number of complements of Gi / Gi + 1 in G / Gi + 1 (cf. [\cite=Gaschutz]). When Si is nonabelian, the series Pi(s) is complicated. If n  ≠  |Si|ri then where Li: = G / CG(Gi / Gi + 1) is the monolithic primitive group with unique minimal normal subgroup [formula] (cf. [\cite=DeLu03]); here [formula] is the socle of Li. Computing these coefficients bi,n is reduced to studying the subgroup structures of the group [formula] induced by the conjugation action of the normalizer in Li of a composition factor of the socle Srii; note that Xi is an almost simple group with socle isomorphic to Si. More precisely, given an almost simple group X with socle S, define the following finite Dirichlet series

[formula]

The following useful Lemma which is deduced from [\cite=Seral].

If Si is nonabelian and π is the set of primes containing at least one divisor of |Si|, then

[formula]

In particular, if n is not divisible by some prime in π, then there exists [formula] with n = mri and bi,n = cm(Xi)  ·  mri - 1.

Here for a Dirichlet series [formula] and a given set of primes π, the series Fπ(s) is obtained from F(s) by deleting terms ann- s whenever n is divisible by some prime in π. Notice that if F(s) is rational then so is Fπ(s).

For an almost simple group X, let Ω(X) be the set of the odd integers [formula] such that

X contains at least one subgroup Y such that [formula] and |X:Y| = m;

if [formula] and |X:Y| = m, then Y is a maximal subgroup if X.

Note that if m∈Ω(X), [formula] and |X:Y| = m, then μX(Y) =  - 1: in particular cm(X) < 0. Combined with Lemma [\ref=paz], this implies:

If m∈Ω(Xi) then bi,mri < 0. We say such an m a useful index for Li.

We are now looking for w(X): =  min {m|m∈Ω(X)} where X is an almost simple group whose socle S a finite simple group appeared in Theorem [\ref=main_theorem]. In case S is either [formula] for some prime p  ≥  5 or a sporadic simple group, the values w(X) are computed in [\cite=Dung-PSL] and [\cite=Dung-Lie] respectively. When [formula] for a prime p  ≥  5, then [formula] is the unique maximal subgroup of S of index p (cf. [\cite=Gur83]) hence w(X) = p. It remains to compute w(X) for [formula] when n = 2t is a 2-power with t  ≥  3.

Now let X be an almost simple group with socle [formula] when n = 2t is a 2-power with t  ≥  3. Let M be a maximal subgroup of X such that M contains a Sylow 2-subgroup of X. By Liebeck and Saxl ([\cite=LiSa85]), the group M is of either intransitive type or imprimitive type unless n = 8 and [formula].

In case M is of intransitive type, i.e., [formula] with 1  ≤  k < n / 2, then

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] be 2-adic expansions of n and k respectively, then applying Lucas' Theorem gives us

[formula]

since ni = 0 for all but i = t. Therefore M is always of even index in X, a contradiction. Hence M is not intransitive.

In case M is of imprimitive type, i.e., [formula] where ab = 2t,a > 1,b > 1, then M has index

[formula]

Notice that w(a,b) is always odd because of the following. For a given integer n, let [formula] be the p-adic expansion of n where p is a prime and 0  ≤  aj  ≤  p - 1 for each j, ad  ≠  0. Let [formula], then Legendre's formula gives us

[formula]

Now in this case n = 2t, then p = 2,at = 1 and ak = 0 for all k  ≠  t. So S2(n) = 1. We have that v2(n!) = 2t - 1. Assume that a = 2u,b = 2v then v2(a) = 2u - 1, v2(b) = 2v - 1 so that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Hence w(a,b) is always odd.

In case n = 8 and [formula] then M = 23:, and so [formula].

Assume that m = ab  ≥  8,a,b  ≥  2. Then

[formula]

is smallest when b is the smallest prime divisor of n.

In particular, when n = 2t, then w(2t - 1,2) is the smallest among w(a,b) with n = ab, a > 1,b > 1. Hence, we obtain the following.

Let X be an almost simple group with socle [formula]. Then we have:

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main_theorem]

We start now the proof of our main result. Let G now be a finitely generated profinite group of which almost every nonabelian composition factor is isomorphic to either a sporadic group, or a projective special linear group [formula] for some prime p  ≥  5, or an alternating group [formula] where n is either a prime or a power of 2. Assume in addition that PG(s) is rational.

We fix a descending normal series {Gi} of G with the properties that [formula] and Gi / Gi + 1 is a chief factor of G / Gi + 1. Let J be the set of indices i with Gi / Gi + 1 non-Frattini. Then the probabilistic zeta function PG(s) can be factorized as

[formula]

where for each i, the finite Dirichlet series Pi(s) is associated to the chief factor Gi / Gi + 1.

For [formula], we define π(C(s)) to be the set of the primes q for which there exists at least one multiple n of q with cn  ≠  0. Notice that if C(s) = A(s) / B(s) is rational then [formula] is finite.

Let Γ be the set of the finite simple groups that are isomorphic to a composition factor of some non-Frattini chief factor of G. The first step in the proof of Theorem [\ref=main_theorem] is to show that Γ is finite. The proof of this claim requires the following result.

Let G be a finitely generated profinite group and let q be a prime with q∉π(PG(s)). If q divides the order of a non-Frattini chief factor of G, then this factor is not a q-group.

Let π(G) be the set of the primes q with the properties that G contains at least an open subgroup H whose index is divisible by q.

The set π(G) is finite.

Let Γ* be the subset of Γ containing simple groups Si∈Γ such that Si is isomorphic to either a sporadic simple group, or [formula] for some prime p  ≥  5, or an alternating group [formula] where n is either a prime or a power of 2. Since PG(s) is rational, the set π(PG(s)) is a finite set. It follows from Lemma [\ref=number_of_non-iso_composition_factors] that Γ contains only finitely many abelian groups, i.e., [formula] is finite.

Notice that for each simple group S∈Γ* which is not sporadic, either there is an odd prime r such that [formula] or [formula] or [formula] for some t  ≥  3. In the latter case, there is also an associated prime pt, namely the largest prime less than 2t. Notice also that for a given prime p, there are only finitely many numbers n such that p is the largest prime less than n, since for every large enough positive integer x, there is always a prime in the interval

[formula]

For a simple group S∈Γ, let [formula]. Our aim is to prove that, under the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=main_theorem], J is a finite set. We have already proved that Γ is finite, so it suffices to prove that IS is finite for each S∈Γ. If S is abelian, then IS is a finite set (cf. [\cite=Dung-Lie]). It remains to consider the nonabelian cases.

Assume that G satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem 1 or Theorem 2. If q is a prime and S is cyclic of order q, then IS is a finite set.

Let q be the set of the non abelian simple groups in [formula] containing a proper subgroup of q-power index. A theorem proved by Guralnick [\cite=Gur83] implies that if T∈q then there exists a unique positive integer α(T) with the property that T contains a subgroup of index qα(T). Consider the set π of all the primes different from q. By [\cite=DaLu02], there exist positive integers ci and nonnegative integers di such that

[formula]

Since [formula] is finite, the set {α(T)|T∈q} is finite. Moreover, by Proposition [\ref=two_conditions_fulfilled], there is a prime number t such that no element in

[formula]

is divisible by t. Since PG(s) is rational, PπG(s) is also rational. But then, by Proposition [\ref=skolem_theorem], the number of nontrivial factors in the product at the right side of equation ([\ref=prodoinfo]) is finite. In particular, IS is a finite set.

The following useful consequence of Skolem-Mahler-Lech theorem is an important tool in deducing finiteness of certain infinite informal products of finite Dirichlet series.

Let G be a finitely generated profinite group with π(G) finite and {ri} the sequence of the composition lengths of the non-Frattini factors in a chief series of G. Assume that there exists a positive integer q and a sequence ci of nonnegative integers such that the formal product

[formula]

is rational. Then ci = 0 for all but finitely many indices i.

Let [formula] be the set of almost simple groups X such that there are infinitely many indices i∈J with [formula], and let [formula]. Our assumptions combined with [\cite=Dung-Lie], imply that [formula] is finite. In order to prove that J is finite, we need to prove that I is empty. Since PG(s) is rational, also [formula] is rational. Thus the product [formula] is still rational. Notice that the set π( of prime divisors of orders of simple groups S such that S =  for some X∈ is finite. Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

Notice that if q > 71 and i∈Λq then Si is isomorphic to either [formula] or t), where q is the largest prime less than 2t, or [formula]. Let

[formula]

Note that if i∈Λq, and n is minimal with the properties that n is odd, bi,nri  ≠  0 and vq(n) = 1, then bi,nri < 0. So if bi,nri  ≠  0 then bi,nri < 0. Moreover, by [\cite=Dung-Lie], we obtain the rational product

[formula]

where bi,wri  ≤  0 for each i∈Λq. By applying Proposition [\ref=skolem_remark], we get that Λ*q  =  {i∈Λq|bi,wri  ≠  0} is finite, but this implies that [formula]. Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

Again, by the same argument, we obtain that [formula]. We continue this procedure until we reach the prime 71. Notice that we deal with both [formula] and [formula] by the prime 71. Now, with the same spirit, we deal with all remaining sporadic groups, alternating groups and [formula] with 5  ≤  q < 71. Our process is described in order in the following table in which the first column stands for the primes r we use in order to deduce that [formula], the second column are simple groups S involved corresponding to the primes in the first column:
