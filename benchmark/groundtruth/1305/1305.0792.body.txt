LOFT (Large Observatory For X-ray Timing): a candidate X-ray mission for the next decade

LOFT description

In Figure [\ref=fig1] we show a scheme of the LOFT satellite, with the LAD and WFM instruments, together with a detailed view of the configuration of the WFM, with its 10 coded mask based cameras. The effective area of the LAD instrument, as compared with that of previous similar instruments flown is also shown (an improvement by a factor of 20 at E=10 keV is expected), as well as the WFM field of view - depicted as the projected effective area in galactic coordinates. The performances of the two instruments for LOFT, LAD and WFM, are shown in Figure [\ref=fig2].

The main scientific topics of LOFT are related to the theme "Matter under extreme conditions", of the ESA Cosmic Vision Programe 2015-2025

(see Figure [\ref=fig3] and http://www.isdc.unige.ch/loft/ for details).

The equation of state of Neutron Stars and the behavior of matter under strong field gravity (i.e., mainly matter accreting onto Black Holes) are the main scientific topics. In addition, LOFT will do what we call "Observatory Science" (see Figure [\ref=fig4]), one topic being the observation of the hard X-ray emission from classical and recurrent novae, related to the shocks between the ejecta and the circumstellar matter. This topic is especially relevant to understand the recently discovered "Fermi novae", emitting in the GeV range. RS Oph (2006 eruption) would have been detected by the Fermi/LAT instrument; the information obtained by RXTE in 2006 was crucial to make this prediction. With LOFT, such a study would have been much more precise (see Figure [\ref=fig4] and paper by Hernanz in this same volume).

A list of selected papers related to LOFT is presented in the references section.
