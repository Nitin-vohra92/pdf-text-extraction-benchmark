Bounding the volumes of singular weak log del Pezzo surfaces

Introduction

Throughout this article, we work over an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic. We will freely use the standard notations in [\cite=KM]. We start by some basic definitions.

Let X be a normal projective surface and Δ be an [formula]-divisor on X with coefficients in

[formula]

Let X be a normal projective variety and let Δ be an [formula]-divisor on X such that KX  +  Δ is [formula]-Cartier. Let f:Y  →  X be a log resolution of (X,Δ), write

[formula]

where Fi is a prime divisor. For some ε∈(0,1], the pair (X,Δ) is called

(a) ε-kawamata log terminal (ε-klt, for short) if ai  >   - 1 + ε for all i, or

(b) ε-log canonical (ε-lc, for short) if [formula] for all i.

In this article we first prove the following theorem.

Let (X,Δ) be an ε-lc weak log del Pezzo surface. Then the anti-canonical volume Vol( - (KX  +  Δ)) = (KX  +  Δ)2 satisfies

[formula]

where ⌊  ~  ⌋ means round down.

Moreover, the equality holds if and only if one of the following holds:

(1) [formula] and (X,Δ) is [formula].

(2) [formula] and (X,Δ) is [formula] or (n,0), where n = ⌊2 / ε⌋, [formula] is the n-th Hirzebruch surface, [formula] is the unique curve with negative self-intersection and n is the projective cone over a rational normal curve of degree n;

By the examples, we can see that this bound is also an optimal bound for ε-lc log del Pezzo surface or ε-lc log del Pezzo surface with Picard number one.

The motivation of this kind of problem is the following B-A-B Conjecture due to A. Borisov, L. Borisov and V. Alexeev.

Let X be a normal projective variety and Δ be a [formula]-divisor on X with coefficients in

[formula]

A collection of varieties {Xλ}λ∈Λ is said to be bounded if there exists h:X  →  S a morphism of finite type of Neotherian schemes such that for each Xλ, Xλ≃Xs for some s∈S.

Fix 0 < ε < 1, an integer n > 0, and consider the set of all n-dimensional ε-klt log [formula]-Fano varieties (X,Δ). The set of underlying varieties {X} is bounded.

The B-A-B Conjecture is still open in dimension three and higher. We are mainly interested in the following weak conjecture for anti-canonical volumes which is a consequence of B-A-B Conjecture.

Fix 0 < ε < 1, an integer n > 0, and consider the set of all n-dimensional ε-klt log [formula]-Fano varieties (X,Δ). The volume Vol( - (KX  +  Δ)) = ( - (KX  +  Δ))n is bounded from above by a fixed number M(n,ε) depending only on n and ε.

In dimension two, Conjecture [\ref=conj2] is well-researched in history. Alexeev establishes two dimensional B-A-B Conjecture and the boundedness for the anti-canonical volumes in [\cite=A], but no clear bound is written down. Alexeev and Mori in [\cite=AM] give a simplified argument for two dimensional B-A-B Conjecture and give an upper bound for the pair (X,Δ) which is

[formula]

Recently Lai in [\cite=Lai] gives an upper bound using covering families of tigers of McKernan and Connectedness Lemma of Kollár and Shokurov, which turns out to be

[formula]

Here we remark that one could use Lai's method to get a refinement of his bound by carefully computation, which is

[formula]

This bound is very close to be optimal. But we should also remark that Lai's method only works for complex number field and rational boundary and the method used in this article is totally different from Lai's method.

For dimension three, recently in [\cite=Lai], Lai proves the following theorem:

Let (X,Δ) be an ε-klt [formula]-factorial log [formula]-Fano threefold of ρ(X) = 1. The degree - K3X satisfies

[formula]

where R(2,ε) is an upper bound of the Cartier index of KS for S any ε / 2-klt log del Pezzo surface of ρ(S)  =  1 and M(2,ε) is an upper bound of the volume Vol( - KS)  =  K2S for S any ε / 2-klt log del Pezzo surface of ρ(S)  =  1.

This is another motivation to find an optimal bound in dimension two. Recently the author is informed by Lai that the assumption on ρ(X) in the above theorem is removed. Hence Conjecture [\ref=conj2] is solved in dimension three. But it remains open in dimension four and higher.

In this article, we solve Conjecture [\ref=conj2] in dimension two by giving an optimal bound.

In the proof of Theorem [\ref=main_thm], we note that when [formula] increases, the upper bound of ( - (KX  +  Δ)) decreases (cf. Remark [\ref=rem1]), where [formula] is the minimal resolution of (X,Δ). So we consider the relation between [formula] and the upper bound of ( - (KX  +  Δ)). We give optimal bounds for the cases when [formula] gets larger.

Let (X,Δ) be an ε-lc weak log del Pezzo surface with [formula]. Then the anti-canonical volume ( - (KX  +  Δ)) = (KX  +  Δ)2 satisfies

[formula]

which is optimal.

Let (X,Δ) be an ε-lc weak log del Pezzo surface with [formula]. Then the anti-canonical volume ( - (KX  +  Δ)) = (KX  +  Δ)2 satisfies

[formula]

which is optimal.

Since almost all smooth weak log del Pezzo surfaces come from blowing up the Hirzebruch surfaces (cf. Lemma [\ref=rat_lem]), we consider the case when blowing up the Hirzebruch surfaces at points in general position.

Let X be a smooth surface which is given by blowing up k points on [formula]. Assume that these points are not on Sn, and no two of them are on the same fiber of [formula]. Assume that - (KX  +  Δ) is nef and big, where Δ is an effective [formula]-divisor (not neccesary a boundary). Then the anti-canonical volume Vol( - (KX  +  Δ)) = (KX  +  Δ)2 satisfies

[formula]

which is optimal if the points are in general position.

Finally we give some examples of smooth weak log del Pezzo surfaces which make the above bounds optimal.

Let X be a smooth surface which is given by blowing up k points on [formula], [formula]. Assume that these points are not on Sn, and no two of them are on the same fiber of [formula]. [formula] is the strict transform of Sn. Then

(1) if [formula], then [formula] is a weak log del Pezzo surface;

(2) if [formula] and the points are in general position, then [formula] is a weak log del Pezzo surface;

(3) if [formula], then (X,Δ) can not be a weak log del Pezzo surface for any boundary Δ.

Preliminaries

Minimal resolution

Let (X,Δ) be an ε-lc weak log del Pezzo surface. The minimal resolution [formula] of (X,Δ) is the unique proper birational morphism such that [formula] is a smooth projective surface and [formula] for some effective [formula]-divisor [formula] on [formula]. Note that minimal resolutions always exist for two-dimensional log pairs.

Hirzebruch surfaces and projective cones

Hirzebruch surfaces play important roles in this article. We recall some basic properties of the Hirzebruch surfaces [formula], [formula]. Denote by h (resp. f) the class in [formula] of the tautological bundle [formula] (resp. of a fiber). Then [formula] with f2 = 0, f.h = 1, h2 = n. If n > 0, there is a unique irreducible curve [formula] such that [formula], S2n =  - n. For n = 0, we can also choose one curve whose class in [formula] is h and denote it by S0. We often denote by F a fiber of [formula] and by Fp the fiber passing through some point [formula].

The following easy proposition allows us to choose the position of the blow-up center on Hirzebruch surfaces.

[formula] blown up at a point on Sn is isomorphic to [formula] blown up at a point not on Sn + 1.

Blowing up a point on [formula], and blowing down the strict transform of the fiber, we get exactly [formula].

Now we consider n, the projective cone over a rational normal curve of degree [formula] with the unique singular point O∈n. Blowing up O∈n, we have a birational morphism [formula], and

[formula]

Hence the minimal resolution of (n,0) is [formula], which makes the examples in Theorem [\ref=main_thm] very natural. It is easy to see that n is [formula]-factorial of Picard number one with - Kn ample.

Intersection inequalities

In this section we recall some easy inequalities on intersection number of curves on surfaces, which is frequently used in this article.

Assume that C and D are divisors on a smooth surface X having no common irreducible component, then by [\cite=H],

[formula]

where (C.D)P is the intersection multiplicity of C and D at P. And by easy calculation (cf. [\cite=H]), for a point p, we have

[formula]

In this article, we will only use a special case when D is an irreducible curve with pi(D) = 1 for pi∈D, [formula]. In this case, we have

[formula]

We will use this inequality frequently without mention.

Bounding the volumes I

In this section, we prove Theorem [\ref=main_thm].

Let (X,Δ) be an ε-lc weak log del Pezzo surface. Take the minimal resolution [formula] with [formula]. It is easy to see that [formula] is a weak log del Pezzo surface, [formula] is with coefficients in

[formula]

Vol(-(K+Δ))=(K+Δ)=(K+Δ)=Vol(-(K+Δ )).

[formula]

and - (KX  +  Δ) is nef and big.

The following lemma gives a rough classification of smooth weak log del Pezzo surfaces.

If X is a smooth surface and Δ is with coefficients in

[formula]

By Base Point Free Theorem (cf. [\cite=HM]), - (KX  +  Δ) is semi-ample. Hence there exists an effective [formula]-divisor D which is nef and big such that [formula] and Δ + D is with coefficients in

[formula]

0 8-8g(C)=K=.

[formula]

Hence at this time X must be rational. We can analyze it case by case.

Case 1: [formula]

In this case, - KX is ample with [formula]. Hence

[formula]

Moreover, the equality holds if and only if Δ = 0, i.e., [formula].

Case 2: [formula], [formula].

Write [formula], where Δi is a reduced irreducible curve different from Sn and [formula] with [formula]. Since [formula] is anti-nef, we have

[formula]

[formula]

Now [formula], we have

[formula]

The first inequality follows from ([\ref=3.1]) and ([\ref=3.2]). The equality holds if and only if α  =   - 2 + a and β  =  n - 2 - na, if and only if [formula], if and only if [formula]. The second inequality follows from the monotonic property of the quadratic function of a. The equality holds if and only if [formula]. The third inequality follows from the monotonic property of the first function on the range of n which is [formula] and the fact that [formula]. The equality holds if and only if n  =  ⌊2 / ε⌋ or ⌊2 / ε⌋=2 and n = 0,1.

Hence in this case, we have

[formula]

The equality holds if and only if one of the followings holds: (i) [formula] where n = ⌊2 / ε⌋ or (ii) ⌊2 / ε⌋=2 and [formula] or [formula].

Case 3: there exists a nontrivial birational morphism [formula] with [formula].

By the proof of Lemma [\ref=rat_lem], we know that g is decomposed by blow-downs of ( - 1)-curves. Since push-forward of blow-downs preserve nef curves, [formula] is anti-nef. Then by Case 2, we have

[formula]

By Negativity Lemma (cf. [\cite=KM]), we have

[formula]

where E is an effective g-exceptional divisor. Then

[formula]

The first inequality follows from the anti-nefness of KX  +  Δ and the effectiveness of E. The equality holds if and only if E = 0.

Hence

[formula]

where the equality holds only if there is a nontrivial crepant birational morphism [formula] for some [formula] or [formula] or [formula] obtained by blow-ups at points. But it is easy to see that after non-trivial crepant blow-ups on the pair [formula] or [formula] or [formula], Δ can not be effective. Hence in this case,

[formula]

Summing up the above cases, we almost complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=main_thm]. Recall that we take minimal resolution at the beginning, now we come back to the singular case, actually we have proved the inequality

[formula]

And the equality holds if and only if one of the following holds:

(1) [formula] and the minimal resolution of (X,Δ) is [formula], where n = ⌊2 / ε⌋;

(2) [formula] and the minimal resolution of (X,Δ) is [formula].

To finish the proof, we only need the next claim.

(1) If the minimal resolution of (X,Δ) is [formula] with [formula], then (X,Δ) is [formula] or (n,0).

(2) If the minimal resolution of (X,Δ) is [formula], then (X,Δ) is [formula].

Let [formula] be the minimal resolution. Since - (KX  +  Δ) is semi-ample, π is a semi-ample model of [formula] (cf. [\cite=BCHM]). Let [formula] be the minimal resolution. Since - Kn is ample, φ is the ample model of [formula] (cf. [\cite=BCHM]). Hence by [\cite=BCHM], there is a birational morphism μ:X  →  n, with [formula]. Since φ only contracts one curve Sn, we conclude that either μ or π is an isomorphism.

(2) follows from similar argument.

Then the proof of Theorem [\ref=main_thm] is completed.

From the proof of Case 3, we can see that when [formula] increases, the upper bound of ( - (KX  +  Δ)) decreases. More precisely:

1. when [formula], [formula], and [formula];

2. when [formula], [formula] for some [formula], and [formula];

3. when [formula], there exists a birational morphism [formula] for some [formula], and [formula].

Hence we want to decide the optimal bound of the volume up to [formula]. In the following two sections, we give the optimal bounds for the cases when [formula] and [formula].

Bounding the volumes II: [formula]

In this section we prove Theorem [\ref=r3].

By taking minimal resolution, we may assume that X is smooth and Δ is with coefficients in

[formula]

K+Δ=φ(K+)+eE

[formula]

Δ=aS+ dΔ+(mult()-1+e)E,

[formula]

K+1-S=⌊ 2/ε ⌋+ 3+,

[formula]

Bounding the volumes III: [formula]

In this section we prove Theorem [\ref=r4].

By taking minimal resolution, we may assume that X is smooth and Δ is with coefficients in

[formula]

K+Δ=φ(K+)+eE

[formula]

K+Δ=φ(K+Δ)+eE

[formula]

Δ=aS+ dΔ+(mult()-1+e)E,

[formula]

K+S+F=⌊ (3+ε)/2ε ⌋++,

[formula]

Blowing up points on [formula] in general position

By Lemma [\ref=rat_lem], almost all smooth weak log del Pezzo surfaces come from blowing up the Hirzebruch surfaces. So we consider the case when blowing up the Hirzebruch surfaces at points in general position. In this section we are going to prove the following theorem. It is actually a generalization of Section 5, Subcase 1.1.

Let X be a smooth surface which is given by blowing up k points on [formula]. Assume that these points are not on Sn, and no two of them are on the same fiber of [formula]. Assume that - (KX  +  Δ) is nef and big, where Δ is an effective [formula]-divisor. Then the anti-canonical volume Vol( - (KX  +  Δ)) = (KX  +  Δ)2 satisfies

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=example2], the bound given above is optimal for points in general position.

Since the volume of a nef and big divisor is always positive, we can tell when such X is of weak log del Pezzo type.

Let X be a smooth surface which is given by blowing up at k points on [formula]. Assume that these points are not on Sn, and no two of them are on the same fiber of [formula]. Assume that there exists an effective [formula]-divisor Δ on X such that - (KX  +  Δ) is nef and big. Then

[formula]

Let [formula] be the blow-up at [formula] and [formula] be the exceptional curves and [formula] be the push-forward of Δ. Write [formula] where [formula] is an irreducible curve different from Sn and [formula] with [formula]. Then by ([\ref=star]), we have

[formula]

with [formula] for [formula]. Hence

[formula]

where [formula] (resp. Δi) is the strict transform of Sn (resp. [formula]) on X. Hence in this setting

[formula]

for [formula]. Since KX  +  Δ is anti-nef, so is [formula]. Hence

[formula]

[formula]

Now denote the fiber in [formula] passing through pj as Fpj for [formula]. And we may assume that [formula] for [formula]. Then for [formula], [formula] can be estimated by the multiplicity inequality ([\ref=mult6]). We have

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

and

[formula]

Now we can estimate the volume. We have

[formula]

The first inequality follows from ([\ref=61]), ([\ref=62]), ([\ref=6a]) and ([\ref=6b]). The second inequality holds since the target can be viewed as a function of ej for all [formula] and it reaches the maximum when ej  =  1 - dj for all [formula]. The third inequality holds since the target can be viewed as a function of dj for all [formula] and it reaches the maximum when dj  =  0 for all [formula]. The last inequality holds since the target can be viewed as a function of a and it reaches the maximum when [formula].

Examples

In this section we give some examples of smooth weak log del Pezzo surfaces which make the above inequalities optimal.

Let X be the blow-up of [formula] at p1 and p2 for some [formula], where [formula] and Fp1 = Fp2 = F. Then [formula] is a weak log del Pezzo surface, where [formula] (resp. [formula]) is the strict transform of Sn (resp. F) on X.

The only thing to prove is the anti-nefness of [formula].

Take an irreducible curve [formula] in X, which is not exceptional over [formula], and take C to be the push-forward of [formula]. Let φ be the blow-up. Then

[formula]

Hence [formula] is anti-nef if and only if for any irreducible curve [formula], assuming that [formula], we have

[formula]

If C = Sn or F, then ([\ref=ex1]) holds obviously.

If C  ≠  Sn or F, then [formula], and

[formula]

We complete the proof.

Let X be a smooth surface which is given by blowing up k points on [formula], [formula]. Assume that these points are not on Sn, and no two of them are on the same fiber of [formula]. Denote by [formula] the strict transform of Sn on X. Then

(1) if [formula], then [formula] is a weak log del Pezzo surface;

(2) if [formula] and the points are in general position, then [formula] is a weak log del Pezzo surface;

(3) if [formula], then (X,Δ) can not be a weak log del Pezzo surface for any boundary Δ.

We say that k points [formula] are in general position if they satisfy the following conditions:

(1) these points are not on Sn, and no two of them are on the same fiber of [formula];

(2) the condition these points provide to define a curve C is linearly independent in H0(O(C));

(3) if [formula] and k = n + 4, there does not exist a curve [formula] with [formula], [formula], such that [formula] for all [formula];

(4) if n = 3 and [formula], no seven of the points lie on a curve [formula].

(3) is by Corollary [\ref=cor].

For (1)(2), the only thing to prove is the anti-nefness of [formula].

Take an irreducible curve [formula] in X, which is not exceptional over [formula], and take C to be the push-forward of [formula]. Let φ be the blow-up at [formula]. Then

[formula]

Hence [formula] is anti-nef if and only if for any irreducible curve [formula], assuming that [formula], we have

[formula]

There are some easy facts:

(1) If C = Sn, then ([\ref=star2]) holds.

(2) If C = Fpj for some [formula], then ([\ref=star2]) holds.

(3) If [formula] and [formula], then ([\ref=star2]) holds.

(4) If [formula], then ([\ref=star2]) holds.

(1) Obvious.

(2) Obvious.

Hence from now on we may assume that C  ≠  Sn and C  ≠  Fpj for [formula].

(3) We have

[formula]

(4) We have

[formula]

(1) of the theorem comes from Fact (4).

Note that [formula]. Denote piC by ai. To prove (2), we only need to prove the following claim.

Assume [formula], [formula] and

[formula]

Then

[formula]

for [formula] in general position.

Assuming Claim for the moment, suppose that (2) is not true, i.e. ([\ref=star2]) fails. Then

[formula]

By Claim, we have

[formula]

Here the left hand side is the number of conditions on C, and the right hand side is [formula]. Hence we have more conditions than sections, which is a contradiction for [formula] in general position.

Case 1: [formula].

In this case, we have

[formula]

Case 2: [formula].

In this case, we have [formula] and

[formula]

Case 3: [formula].

In this case we may assume that

[formula]

and we need to show that

[formula]

Subcase 3.1: [formula].

In this subcase we may assume that k = n + 4. We have

[formula]

The equality holds if and only if 2α  =  β + 1 and ai  =  α for [formula]. At this time, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since [formula] are in general position, this won't happen.

Subcase 3.2: n = 3.

In this subcase we may assume that k = 8. [formula] implies β = 0 or 1.

If β = 0, then

[formula]

If β = 1 and [formula], then

[formula]

The equality holds if and only if α  =  2 and [formula] for [formula]. But this will not happen since [formula].

If β = 1 and α = 1, then [formula]. For [formula] in general position, ai > 0 holds for at most 7 points, hence we may assume that a8 = 0. Then

[formula]

The equality holds if and only if ai = 1 for [formula]. At this time, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since [formula] are in general position, this won't happen.

Subcase 3.3: n = 2.

In this subcase we may assume that k = 7. [formula] implies β = 0. We have

[formula]

We also have similar examples for n = 0,1.

Let X be a smooth surface which is given by blowing up at k points on [formula], n = 0 or 1. Then

(1) if [formula] and the points are in general position, then (X,0) is a weak log del Pezzo surface;

(2) if [formula], then (X,Δ) can not be a weak log del Pezzo surface for any boundary Δ.

Here when n = 1, the examples are just weak del Pezzo surfaces in the common sense, which is well-known, and the meaning for "general position" can be stated more precisely. Hence the examples we give here can be viewed as some kind of generalization of the traditional examples.

Taking n = ⌊2 / ε⌋ in Theorem [\ref=example2], it gives examples of ε-lc weak log del Pezzo surfaces with [formula]. So it is interesting to ask for the existence of ε-lc weak log del Pezzo surfaces with large [formula].
