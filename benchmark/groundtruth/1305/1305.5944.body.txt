Efficiency and uniformity measurements of a light concentrator in combination with a SiPM array

Introduction

Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) are multi-pixel APDs operated in Geiger mode. This solid-state photon detection technology provides good single photon detection capability and high photon detection efficiency. Further features are their compact size, insensitivity to magnetic fields and cost efficiency, which make them suitable for many research fields that require photon detection, such as particle physics, nuclear physics or medical imaging. A position sensitive Cherenkov detector was built, consisting of an array of [formula] SiPMs (Hamamatsu S10931-­‐100P) with an active area of [formula] mm2 each and a pixel size of [formula] μm2. The signals are amplified with four 16 channel amplifiers that were built in-house and are based on Photonique amplifiers. In addition, a suitable light concentrator consisting of 64 pyramid-­‐shaped funnels was developed. With an entrance surface of [formula] mm2 and an exit surface of [formula] mm2, this light concentrator, which is made out of brass and coated with aluminium, increases the detection area of the module, while providing sufficient position resolution, e. g. for the barrel DIRC detector [\cite=DIRC4PANDA] at the PANDA experiment at the FAIR facility in Darmstadt [\cite=PANDALOI]. Increasing the detection area of the detector by this method gives several advantages. One essential advantage is that the signal-to-noise ratio improves by increasing the sensitive area using light focusing and keeping the dark count rate constant [\cite=S2Nratio]. Another benefit is that the number of read-out channels can be kept low, thus the module can be built very compactly. In previous work, simulations for the collection efficiency were performed [\cite=Ahmed] as well as a scan with a laser beam to measure the collection efficiency of the module. However, the beam spot diameter was as large as 1 mm and the step size was 250  μm [\cite=Gruber]. These two parameters have been improved significantly in the new tests, providing a more detailed picture of the characteristics of the SiPMs and the light concentrator. Also, a scan with a finite incident angle was performed. The new data allows to further optimize the light guide.

Test Setup

To test the position sensitive photon detector, the complete setup was put inside a dark box. The test setup consists of the detector module, a light source and two stepping motors which move the beam spot across the area of the scanned SiPMs. The Hamamatsu 10931 [formula] mm2 SiPMs with a pixel size of [formula]m2 were chosen because they have the highest photon detection efficiency and an adequate dynamic range. The 10931 sensor series has the photon detection maximum at λ = 440 nm. For the scan, a light source with a wavelength near that maximum looked reasonable and an LED with a wavelength range of 465 nm <  λ < 475 nm was used. The light source was set to emit pulses instead of a continuous wave in order not to saturate the sensor. The pulse rate of the LED was about 900 kHz with a pulse width of about 6.5 ns. To reduce the beam spot diameter from [formula] mm at the LED exit to [formula]m at the SiPM surface, an optical setup, including 3 biconvex lenses and a 10  μm pinhole were included into the test setup. This optical apparatus, which is presented in figure [\ref=fig:schematic_laser] was moved by the two stepping motors, which changed the beam spot position on the detector and the array by steps of 100 μm. This guaranteed that each pixel of the SiPM was triggered by the light beam. During the tests, the coordinate convention was defined as follows: The x- and z-axis build a plane parallel to the detector surface and the y-axis is parallel to the beam direction. Figure [\ref=fig:motor] shows a schematic of the optical setup and its mounting on the stepping motors. Furthermore, it gives an overview of the chosen coordinate convention. Due to the fact that the motors are high precision tools and that the weight had to be completely poised in order to keep the precision of the motors at its high level, some measures had to be taken. The beam spot could be moved in an x- and z-direction. In order to reduce the wiggling of the motor tips, cage plates were mounted to serve as stabilisers. The optical apparatus is fixed via fixation cage plates on the x-axis motor tip, the beam direction is parallel to the y-axis of this setup.

Figure [\ref=fig:darkbox] shows the opto-motoric setup together with the detector module inside the dark box.

Scanned Channels and scanning mode

Due to timing restraints not all 64 sensors could be scanned. Thus, three adjacent SiPMs were chosen randomly for the test. These sensors are referred to as F2, F3 and F4. Their position on the detector module surface can be seen in figure [\ref=fig:F2F3F4].

The sensors were scanned in three different ways. In the first two setups, all three sensors were scanned at once, with and without light concentrator. In order to test the behaviour of the collection efficiency in dependence of the incident beam angle, each sensor was scanned separately with light concentrator and an incident beam angle of about [formula].

Data Acquisition

For the data acquisition, a LeCroy 735Zi WavePro digital oscilloscope was used. Three channels were used to acquire the signal, while the fourth one was used as trigger input. The scope of the experiment was to extract the pulse height from the signal of the respective SiPM. The amplitude of the signal was measured by acquiring the minimum of each waveform during the acquisition window of 200 ns. To achieve good statistics, 1000 samples were taken per position of the photon source for each of the three channels respectively. The oscilloscope calculated the mean and standard deviation of 1000 samples of the amplitude. The acquired data for each channel was background corrected and then added up. The data is referred to as 〈a〉LC and 〈a〉noLC for the mean amplitude with and without light concentrator respectively. These two data values (per channel) were saved into a text file, together with information about the coordinates of the beam position. Taking into account the number of data points that need to be acquired during the scans, it is obvious that an automation routine is beneficial. Such a routine was created with LabVIEW and regulates the beam spot movement by the motors as well as the data acquisition by the oscilloscope and the saving of the data. Figure [\ref=fig:DAQ] shows a snapshot of the data acquisition with the oscilloscope.

Results

Qualitative analysis

The data, acquired during the scans was transformed into two dimensional histograms, using routines based on C++ and ROOT. Figure [\ref=fig:TripleScan] shows the two dimensional histograms from a top view. It is possible to clearly distinguish between the original sensitive area and the enhanced sensitive area when the light concentrator is applied. Also, the reduced collection efficiency due to an incident beam angle is evident in [\ref=fig:TopViewc]. As can be seen in figure [\ref=fig:TripleScan], it can be distinguished between active areas and the areas where no photons get detected. One reason for the inactive area is the finite rim which separates the funnels from each other. At these areas, photons get reflected. Another reason is that the sensors were not soldered in perfect alignment, resulting in an offset between the exit area of the light concentrator and the active area of the SiPMs. Figure [\ref=fig:qualitative] shows a comparison between the two dimensional histograms and microscope photos of the respective channels, illustrating the offset of the sensors in relation to the light concentrator.

Collection efficiency

The collection efficiency of the light concentrator can be calculated by comparing the data from the scans with light concentrator to the scans without the light concentrator. The collection efficiency εcol of one funnel of the light concentrator is defined by

[formula]

with nd being the number of photons detected with light concentrator, nd0 the number of detected photons without light concentrator and [formula] an area factor [\cite=Gruber]. The 0.93 in the area factor α is the geometric fill factor and puts into account the fact that the edges are rounded. The area factor α represents the enlargement of the detection area of a SiPM and is in this specific case Aentrance / Aexit, where Aentrance and Aexit represent the entrance and exit area respectively. The collection efficiency εcol was calculated, using the following equation for a certain funnel:

[formula]

Table [\ref=tab:results] shows the results for the collection efficiency for each sensor with incident beam angles of [formula] and [formula] respectively. The mean collection efficiency is also given.

Comparison to simulations

Comparing the measured mean values with simulations of the collection efficiency of the light concentrator shows that the results are in good agreement with the simulations. The simulated collection efficiency for a light concentrator with a funnel length of 4.5 mm and an incident beam angle perpendicular to the detector surface is about 86  %. The mean of the measured collection efficiency for the light concentrator with an incident beam angle of [formula] is also about 86  %. Applying an incident beam angle of [formula] results in a mean collection efficiency of about 57  %, compared to the simulation value of 61  %. Figure [\ref=fig:simulation] shows the results of the simulation for the light concentrator, which was done previously by the authors [\cite=Ahmed]. The figure displays the collection efficiency for different funnel lengths. The simulated collection efficiencies are given in dependence of the incident beam angle.

Conclusion and outlook

A prototype of a position sensitive SiPM array with a light concentrator was tested in order to evaluate the collection efficiency by scanning with a narrowly-focused LED light. The scans were performed with a light source of a beam spot diameter of [formula]m and a stepping size of 100  μm. These parameters have been improved significantly to earlier tests, giving a more detailed picture of the collection efficiency and uniformity. In addition, the performance of the light concentrator collection efficiency was tested for two different incident light beam angles, [formula] and [formula]. The simulation agrees well with the data and can be used to further optimise the geometry of the light concentrator. Ideas to optimise the detector include better alignment of the sensors to the concentrator or a slightly narrower exit area in order to remove the gaps in-between and to develop a different kind of light concentrator with plexiglas cones instead of a metal grid.
