On the asymptotic evolution of finite energy Airy wavefunctions

Airy wavefunctions [\cite=berry] describe nondiffracting optical beams, nondispersing optical pulses in fibers or nonspreading quantum wavepackets. They have a number of remarkable properties. As self-bending beams, their trajectories can be ballistically controled [\cite=hu2010]. Also, the main beam characteristics are recovered after the blockage of its central lobe along the propagation path. This has been named the self-healing property of Airy beams [\cite=healing]. Among other applications, Airy beams have been proposed for particle micromanipulation [\cite=micromanipulation], the realization of steerable electronic wavepackets [\cite=Voloch2013], the reduction of the beam scintillation due to atmospheric turbulence [\cite=gu] or for nonlinear optical applications [\cite=chen2013] [\cite=polynkin].

Pure Airy waveforms are associated with optical beams of infinite energy. Some sort of truncation is required to produce finite energy solutions that keep the main characteristics of Airy beams over a limited propagation distance and can be used in experimental and theoretical investigations. The exponential apodization of the initial beam profile proposed by Siviloglou and Christodoulides [\cite=siviloglou] is the most widely used approximation to the infinite energy Airy beam.

In this letter, we point out a new intriguing property of the finite energy Airy wavepackets. Normally, a higher localization of a wavepacket of a certain class results in a lower localization of its transform representation. This is, for instance, the expected behaviour of a Gaussian wavefunction as dictated by the uncertainty principle: if we reduce the uncertainty of its position (time) the indetermination of its momentum (energy) increases. For finite energy Airy wavefunctions this is not the case, and localization is increased simultaneously in its direct and transform representations, always within the limits imposed by the uncertainty principle. For an optical beam, this has associated the remarkable consequence that the far field asymptotic diffraction broadening of the solution decreases as the spatial localization of the initial condition is increased.

We present an asymptotic analysis of the evolution of finite energy Airy wavepackets. We will use the language corresponding to the description of an optical beam, but the results apply equally to the dynamics of any system described by the Schrödinger equation. A detailed analysis of the propagation properties of Airy beams using uniform geometrical optics has been presented in [\cite=kaganovsky]. Here, we study the asymptotic characteristics of finite energy Airy beams using the stationary phase method. The results permit to identify one particularly relevant contribution to the beam dynamics that admits a Gaussian-type approximation. This approximate mode has Gaussian phase and amplitude, plus a nontrivial factor that produces a shift of the beam intensity peak position relative to that of the Gaussian term. As commented above, it is found that the localization in the far field is correlated with that of the initial condition whereas the asymptotic evolution of the beam intensity peak value is nearly the same at all degrees of initial localization. We identify the regions of validity of this approximation that extend relatively close to the illumination plane.

The evolution of a paraxial optical beam in a linear homogeneous medium is described by the Schrödinger equation

[formula]

that has an exact accelerating finite energy Airy beam solution[\cite=siviloglou]

[formula]

that reduces to a pure Airy beam[\cite=berry] when a = 0. For a  ≥  1, the field at ζ = 0 and ξ < 0 is negligible and the oscillations of the Airy function at negative values of the argument are effectively washed out from the initial condition, which becomes very close to a bell-shaped lobe with nearly constant phase. The rms width of the input beam achieves its minimum value at a≃0.63 and then starts to grow with a. We will be primarily interested in the behavior of these solutions at the smaller values of a.

In order to obtain the beam asymptotics we start with the initial condition [formula]. Its Fourier transform provides the angular spectrum

[formula]

So, the degree of localization of the solution increases with a simultaneously in the spatial and spectral domains. For an arbitrary ζ, the beam Fourier transform is obtained by a direct multiplication with the Fresnel diffraction operator [formula] which, upon inverse transforming, gives the beam evolution

[formula]

with

[formula]

For large ζ, the integral in [\eqref=eq:integral] can be evaluated asymptotically using the stationary phase method. We define [formula]. If 4δ  /  ζ > 1, below the beam caustic, there are no real stationary phase points. If 4δ  /  ζ < 1, the two real roots of h'(kξ) = 0

[formula]

give two contributions to the expansion u(ξ,ζ)  ~  u1(ξ,ζ) + u2(ξ,ζ) at ζ  →    ∞   with

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

where the prime has been used to denote the derivative of the function.

Both u1 and u2 become singular at δ  =  ζ / 4 where h''(c1) and h''(c2) are null. This corresponds to the curve

[formula]

that runs close to the accelerating main lobe of the Airy beam. The contribution u2 is highly localized at the trajectory [\eqref=caustic] and it is negligible for most (ξ,ζ) at distances sufficiently far from the illumination plane, where u(ξ,ζ)  ~  u1(ξ,ζ). In the region δ <  < ζ that coincides with ξ <  < ζ2 for sufficiently large ζ and small a, u1 can be approximated by a Gaussian-like distribution

[formula]

Figure [\ref=imagenes] shows the Airy beam amplitude for a = 0.1, the corresponding distributions for the asymptotic contributions u1 and u2 and the Gaussian approximation ua. The curve [\eqref=caustic] is marked as a dashed line in all plots. To ease the visual comparsion between the plots, the amplitude in subfigures (b), (c) and (d) has been truncated to the maximum value reached in panel (a).

Even though the asymptotic solutions are strictly defined only above the curve [\eqref=caustic], their extensions to the whole (ξ,ζ) plane by the analytic continuations of the respective solutions are represented. In Fig. 1 one can observe that, except for the characteristic transverse oscillations in the Airy function that can be found in the early evolution stages of the beam, the asympotic solution provides a very good description of the beam behaviour even at relatively small values of ζ. u2 is highly localized close to the curve given in [\eqref=caustic], but it exhibits a very irregular shape as we approach this singularity. u1 also becomes singular at δ  =  ζ / 4, where it displays similar features as u2, but it has a smooth shape in the whole δ  <  ζ / 4 region. ua results from the extension to the whole (ξ,ζ) plane of the approximation obtained for u1 when δ <  < ζ. This is a very simple solution that provides an adequate description of the beam in a large domain within the propagation plane.

The input beam width Δξ≃a- 1 decreases as a increases. The spectral width of the input conditions is [formula] according to [\eqref=espectro] and diminishes as the transverse localization of the beam increases. Consistently, at a given ζ the beam width of the Gaussian term that dominates the transverse localization properties of the beam is [formula], showing the unexpected decrease of the diffraction induced beam broadening rate as the initial localization increases. This is illustrated in Figure [\ref=raro] which displays the exact beam evolution (a) and that of the corresponding approximate Gaussian asymptotics (b) for a = 0.3. This value of a imposes a larger degree of localization of the input conditions, whereas a direct comparison with Fig. [\ref=imagenes] (showing the values for a = 0.1) reveals a slower far field beam broadening for the larger initial transverse confinement case. The product [formula] decreases with a until a minimum value is reached, always within the limits of the uncertainty principle. The minimum value of the product of the rms spatial and spectral widths is [formula] at a≃0.757.

Even though the transverse beam profile is dominated by the Gaussian term that peaks at ξ = a2 / 3, the particular dependence of the square root in the denominator with ζ and ξ shifts the beam center to

[formula]

for large ζ and δ <  < ζ. At the peak position [\eqref=xmax], δ(ξmax,ζ) = 1 / (2aζ). Therefore, the asymptotic evolution of the peak amplitude is

[formula]

Since [formula] for sufficiently small a, all the solutions will have very similar asymptotic peak amplitudes in spite of having different asymptotic beam widths; the deviation is as small as 4.25% [\eqref=peakamplitude] for a = 0.5 and 0.9% for a = 0.3.

Figure [\ref=maximo] (a) shows the evolution of the finite energy Airy beam maxima for different values of a with lines and the corresponding values for the approximate Gaussian mode with points. The transverse positions corresponding to these maxima are shown in Fig. [\ref=maximo](b). These plots display two clearly distinct regions in the beam evolution. In the first stage, the beam peak follows the curved trajectory of the main lobe of the Airy beam. At a given point, both the trajectory described by the beam peak amplitude and its value start to proceed along the prediction of the quasi-Gaussian term. We define this point ζf as an effective transition boundary that permits to quantify the domain of validity for the asymptotic approximation. The dependence of ζf on the value of a is very close to 1 / a in the range of a between 0.05 and 0.4. For ζ  >  ζf the beam is adequately described by the asymptotic term u1 or its Gaussian approximation ua and its main properties are given by Eqs. [\eqref=xmax] and [\eqref=peakamplitude].

Althoguh ua has a singularity in the transverse plane at each ζ, its squared modulus can be integrated in the sense of the principal value of the integral and can be evaluated as the Hilbert transform of a Gaussian waveform to give

[formula]

that, for large ζ, reads

[formula]

and coincides with the value of the power carried by the exact finite energy Airy beam [\cite=siviloglou].

We have presented an asymptotic analysis of finite energy Airy wavefunctions that provides an approximate analytical description of these solutions over extense regions including those of interest in typical applications. The results obtained permit to identify different evoution domains with markedly distinct behaviour. Our description can be very useful in problems such as the analysis of Airy beams at nonlinear interfaces. For the linear case [\cite=chremmos], an effective study can be based on a plane-wave decomposition but our asymptotic analysis allows to deal with the extended interaction of the input beam with an interface in the nonlinear case [\cite=chamorro]. This analysis can be extended in a trivial way to 2D by separation of variables and highlights the existence of a correlation in the degree of localization in the initial and asymptotic evolution regions of finite energy Airy wavefunctions.
