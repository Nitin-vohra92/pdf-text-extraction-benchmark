Rotationally symmetric harmonic diffeomorphisms between surfaces

Introduction

The existence of harmonic diffeomorphisms between complete Riemannian manifolds has been extensively studied, please see for example [\cite=ak]-[\cite=w]. In particular, Heinz [\cite=hz] proved that there is no harmonic diffeomorphism from the unit disc onto [formula] with its flat metric. On the other hand, Schoen [\cite=rs] mentioned a question about the existence, or nonexistence, of a harmonic diffeomorphism from the complex plane onto the hyperbolic 2-space. At the present time, many beautiful results about the asymptotic behavior of harmonic embedding from [formula] into the hyperbolic plane have been obtained, please see for example [\cite=wt] [\cite=httw] [\cite=atw] [\cite=aw], or the review [\cite=wt2] by Wan and the references therein. In 2010, Collin and Rosenberg [\cite=cr] constructed harmonic diffeomorphisms from [formula] onto the hyperbolic plane. In [\cite=ta] [\cite=ta2] [\cite=rr] [\cite=cl], the authors therein studied the rotational symmetry case. One of their results is the nonexistence of rotationally symmetric harmonic diffeomorphism from [formula] onto the hyperbolic plane.

In this paper, we will study the existence, or nonexistence, of rotationally symmetric harmonic diffeomorphisms from the unit disk without the origin onto a punctured disc. For simplicity, let us denote

[formula]

here [formula] is the unit disc, and z is the complex coordinate of [formula]. We will prove the following results. And vice versa, that is: We will also consider the Euclidean case, and will prove the following theorem.

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we will prove Theorem [\ref=thm1] and Theorem [\ref=thm2]. Theorem [\ref=thm3] will be proved in section 3. At the last section, we will give an alternative proof for the nonexistence of rotationally symmetric harmonic diffeomorphism from [formula] onto the hyperbolic disc.

Harmonic maps from [formula] to P(a) with its hyperbolic metric and vice versa

For convenience, let us recall the definition about the harmonic maps between surfaces. Let M and N be two oriented surfaces with metrics τ2|dz|2 and σ2|du|2 respectively, where z and u are local complex coordinates of M and N respectively. A C2 map u from M to N is harmonic if and only if u satisfies

[formula]

Now let us prove Thoerem [\ref=thm1].

First of all, let us denote (r,θ) as the polar coordinates of [formula], and u as the complex coordinates of P(a) in [formula], then the hyperbolic metric σ1d|u| on P(a) can be written as

[formula]

here |u| is the norm of u with respect to the Euclidean metric.

We will prove this theorem by contradiction. Suppose u is a rotationally symmetric harmonic diffeomorphism from [formula] onto P(a) with the metric σ1d|u|. Because [formula] , P(a) and the metric σ1d|u| are rotationally symmetric, we can assume that such a map u has the form u = f(r)eiθ. Substituting u, σ1 to [\eqref=eqdef], we can get

[formula]

for 1 > r > 0. Since u is a harmonic diffeomorphism from [formula] onto P(a), we have

[formula]

or

[formula]

We will just deal with the case that [\eqref=hdeq2] is satisfied, the rest case is similar. Let F =  ln f∈( - a,0), then we have

[formula]

Using this fact, we can get from [\eqref=hdeq1] the following equation.

[formula]

with F(0) =  - a, F(1) = 0 and F'(r) > 0 for 1 > r > 0.

Regarding r as a function of F, we have the following relations.

[formula]

Using these facts, we can get from [\eqref=hdeqF1] the following equation.

[formula]

for 0 > F >  - a. Let x = ( ln r)'(F), from [\eqref=hdeqF2] we can get the following equation.

[formula]

One can solve this Bernoulli equation to obtain

[formula]

here c0 is a constant depending on the choice of the function f. So

[formula]

Since x = ( ln r)'(F), we can get

[formula]

Noting that x(F) is continuous in ( - a,0) and is equal to 1 as F =  - a, or 0, one can get x is uniformly bounded for F∈[ -  a,0]. So the right hand side of [\eqref=hdeqF3] is uniformly bounded, but the left hand side will tend to -    ∞   as F  →   - a. Hence we get a contradiction. Therefore such f does not exist, Theorem [\ref=thm1] has been proved.

We are going to prove Theorem [\ref=thm2].

First of all, let us denote (r,θ) as the polar coordinates of P(a), and u as the complex coordinates of [formula] in [formula], then the hyperbolic metric σ2d|u| on [formula] can be written as

[formula]

here |u| is the norm with respect to the Euclidean metric.

We will prove this theorem by contradiction. The idea is similar to the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1]. Suppose ψ is a rotationally symmetric harmonic diffeomorphism from P(a) onto [formula] with the metric σ2d|u|, with the form ψ = g(r)eiθ, then substituting ψ, σ2 to u, σ in [\eqref=eqdef] respectively, we can get

[formula]

for 1 > r > e- a. Since v is a harmonic diffeomorphism from P(a) onto [formula], we have

[formula]

or

[formula]

We will only deal with the case that [\eqref=thm2-3] is satisfied, the rest case is similar. Let G =  ln g, then the equation [\eqref=thm2-2] can be rewritten as

[formula]

for 1 > r > e- a, with G(1) = 0 and lim r  →  e- aG(r) =  -   ∞  .

Regarding r as a function of G, using a similar formula of [\eqref=hdeqFp], from [\eqref=thm2-4] we can get

[formula]

Similar to solving [\eqref=hdeqF2], we can get the solution to [\eqref=thm2-5] as follows.

[formula]

for some nonnegative constant c1 depending on the choice of g. If c1 is equal to 0, then g = r, this is in contradiction to [\eqref=thm2-3]. If c1 is positive, then taking integration on both sides of [\eqref=thm2-6], we can get

[formula]

So

[formula]

with lim g  →  0 +r(g) = 0. On the other hand, from [\eqref=thm2-3], we have r(0) = e- a. Hence we get a contradiction. Therefore such g does not exist, Theorem [\ref=thm2] has been proved.

Harmonic maps from [formula] to P(a) with its Euclidean metric and vice versa

Now let us consider the case of that the target has the Euclidean metric.

Let us prove the first part of this theorem, that is, show the nonexistence of rotationally symmetric harmonic diffeomorphism from [formula] onto P(a) with its Euclidean metric. The idea is similar to the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1], so we just sketch the proof here. Suppose there is such a harmonic diffeomorphism φ from [formula] onto P(a) with its Euclidean metric with the form φ = h(r)eiθ, then we can get

[formula]

with

[formula]

or

[formula]

We will just deal with the case that [\eqref=thm3-2] is satisfied, the rest case is similar. Let H = ( ln h)' > 01 > r > 0, then we can get

[formula]

Solving this equation, we can get

[formula]

here c3 is a constant depending on the choice of h such that H > 01 > r > 0 which implies

[formula]

So

[formula]

here c4 is a constant depending on the choice of h. Hence

[formula]

From [\eqref=thm3-5j] and [\eqref=thm3-6], we can get lim r  →  0h(r) =   ∞  . On the other hand, from [\eqref=thm3-2], h(0) = e- a. We get a contradiction. Hence such a function h does not exist, the first part of Theorem [\ref=thm3] holds.

Now let us prove the second part of this theorem, that is, show the existence of rotationally symmetric harmonic diffeomorphisms from P(a) onto [formula] with its Euclidean metric. It suffices to find a map from P(a) onto [formula] with the form q(r)eiθ such that

[formula]

with q(e- a) = 0, q(1) = 1 and q' > 0 for 1 > r > e- a. Using the boundary condition and [\eqref=thm3-6], we can get that

[formula]

is a solution to [\eqref=thm3-7].

Therefore we finished the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm3].

Harmonic maps from [formula] to the hyperbolic disc

In this section, we will give another proof of the following result which has been proved in [\cite=ta] [\cite=ta2] [\cite=rr] [\cite=cl].

There is no rotationally symmetric harmonic diffeomorphism from [formula] onto the hyperbolic disc.

It well-known that the hyperbolic metric on the unit disc is [formula]. We will also use the idea of the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1]. Suppose there is such a harmonic diffeomorphism φ from [formula] onto [formula] with its hyperbolic metric with the form φ = k(r)eiθ, then we can get

[formula]

with

[formula]

Regarding r as a function of k, setting v = ( ln r)'(k), the equation [\eqref=prop-1] can be rewritten as

[formula]

That is,

[formula]

One can solve this equation to obtain

[formula]

for some nonnegative constant c5 depending on the choice of the function k. If c5 = 0, then we can get r = c6k for some constant c6. On the other hand, φ is a diffeomorphism, so k  →  1 as r  →    ∞  . This is a contradiction. If c5 > 0, then b1  ≥  k2 + c5(1 - k2)2  ≥  b2 for some positive constants b1 and b2. So

[formula]

This is in contradiction to the assumption that r  →    ∞   as k  →  1.

Therefore Proposition [\ref=p] holds.
