The minimal displacement and extremal spaces

Introduction

Throughout the paper [formula] denotes a real or complex infinite-dimensional Banach space. The notion of the minimal displacement was introduced by K. Goebel in [\cite=Goebel]. Let C be a bounded closed and convex subset of X and T:C  →  C a mapping. The minimal displacement of T is the number Goebel showed that if T is k-Lipschitz then where [formula] denotes the Chebyshev radius of C. There are some spaces and sets with [formula] The minimal displacement characteristic of X is a function where BX denotes the closed unit ball of X and [formula] is the class of k-Lipschitz mappings. It is known that for any space X and the spaces with [formula] are said to be extremal. Among extremal spaces are some sequence and function spaces such as [formula] (see [\cite=GMMV] [\cite=Pia]).

Recently Bolibok [\cite=Bolibok1] proved that in [formula]It is still an open problem whether the space [formula] is extremal with respect to the minimal displacement. Recall that [formula] is isometric to [formula] where [formula] is the Stone-ech compactification of [formula]. In this note we show that every separable C(K) space, where K is compact Hausdorff, is strictly extremal (see Definition [\ref=Def1]). This is a consequence of a more general Theorem [\ref=predual], which states that all separable preduals of L1 are (strictly) extremal. An analogous result holds in the non-commutative case of separable non-type I [formula]-algebras.

Results

We begin by recalling the arguments which show that (a real or complex) c0 is extremal (see [\cite=Go] [\cite=GMMV]). Fix k  ≥  1 and define a mapping T:Bc0  →  Bc0 byIt is clear that T∈L(k) and for any x = (x1,x2,x3,...)∈Bc0, [formula] since the reverse inequality implies [formula] [formula] and, consequently, [formula] for i = 1,2,3,..., which contradicts x∈c0. Notice that the minimal displacement [formula] is not achieved by T at any point of Bc0. This suggests the following definition.

A Banach space X is said to be strictly extremal if for every k > 1, there exists a mapping T:BX  →  BX, [formula] such that [formula] for every x∈BX.

It follows from the above that c0 is strictly extremal. On the other hand we have the following result.

Suppose that BX has the fixed point property for nonexpansive mappings (i.e., every nonexpansive mapping S:BX  →  BX has a fixed point). Then for every k-Lipschitz mapping T:BX  →  BX, k  ≥  1, there exists x∈BX such that [formula] In particular, X is not strictly extremal.

Let T:BX  →  BX be k-Lipschitz. Then [formula] is nonexpansive and consequently there exists [formula] such that Tx = kx. Hence [formula]

Proposition [\ref=Prop1] applies to all uniformly nonsquare Banach spaces, uniformly noncreasy spaces as well as to [formula].

In what follows we need the following observation.

Suppose that Y is a subspace of a Banach space X and there exists an m-Lipschitz retraction R:BX  →  BY. Then for every k  ≥  1.

Fix ε > 0 and select a k-Lipschitz mappping T:BY  →  BY such that [formula] for every y∈BY. Define [formula] by putting [formula] x∈BX. Then for every x∈BX. Notice that [formula] is km-Lipschitz and henceThis completes the proof since ε is arbitrary.

Recall that Y is said to be a k-complemented subspace of a Banach space X if there exists a (linear) projection P:X  →  Y with [formula] The well known Sobczyk theorem asserts that c0 is 2-complemented in any separable Banach space X containing it.

Let X be a separable space which contains c0. Then

Let P:X  →  c0 be a projection with [formula] and define a retraction R:X  →  c0 byThen R is 2-Lipschitz and R(BX)  ⊂  R(Bc0). It is enough to apply Lemma [\ref=lem1] since c0 is extremal.

The most interesting case is if X contains a 1-complemented copy of c0.

Let X be a separable infinite-dimensional Banach space whose dual is an L1(μ) space over some measure space (Ω,Σ,μ). Then [formula] i.e., X is an extremal space.

It follows from the Zippin theorem (see [\cite=Zi1]) that if X is a separable infinite-dimensional real Banach space whose dual is an L1(μ), then X contains a 1-complemented copy of c0. If X is complex, consider its real part to obtain a 1-Lipschitz retraction R:X  →  c0. It is now enough to apply Lemma [\ref=lem1].

By examining the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem1] we conclude that every separable predual of L1(μ) is in fact strictly extremal. It is well known that C(K), the Banach space of scalar-valued continuous functions on the Hausdorff compact space K, is a predual of some L1(μ) (see, e.g., [\cite=La]). Hence we obtain the following corollary.

Every separable infinite-dimensional C(K) space, for some compact Hausdorff space K, is strictly extremal.

There exists an extensive literature regarding complemented subspaces of Banach spaces. Our next simple observation is concerned with the connection between the existence of a nonexpansive retraction and the fixed point property.

Suppose that Y is a subspace of a Banach space X and there exists a nonexpasive retraction R:X  →  Y such that R(BX)  ⊂  BY. If BX has the fixed point property for nonexpasive mappings, then BY has the fixed point property, too.

Suppose, contrary to our claim, that there exists a nonexpansive mapping T:BY  →  BY without a fixed point. Then the mapping [formula] is nonexpansive and fixed point free which contradicts our assumption.

It is well-known that [formula] has the fixed point property, whereas Bc0 does not have the fixed point property for nonexpansive mappings (see, e.g., [\cite=GoKi]). Hence we obtain another proof of the well-known result that there is no nonexpansive retraction from [formula] into Bc0. In the same way, we conclude that there is no nonexpansive retraction from [formula] into B0, where 0 denotes the space of scalar-valued sequences converging to 0 with respect to a Banach limit. Notice that 0 is a strictly extremal subspace of [formula] of codimension one.

The space C(K) of complex-valued continuous functions on K forms a commutative [formula]-algebra under addition, pointwise multiplication and conjugation. The remainder of this paper deals with a special class of [formula]-algebras. Recall (see, e.g., [\cite=Ro]) that a [formula]-algebra A is called type I if every irreducible [formula]-representation φ:A  →  B(H) on a Hilbert space H satisfies K(H)  ⊂  φ(A) (φ is called irreducible if φ(A) has no invariant (closed linear) subspaces other than {0} and H). A fundamental example of non-type I [formula]-algebra is the CAR (canonical anti-commutation relations) algebra, defined as follows. Identify [formula] with infinite matrices and define [formula] to be all [formula] so that there exist n  ≥  0 and A∈M2n (the space of all 2n  ×  2n matrices over [formula]) such thatThe CAR algebra is the norm-closure of [formula].

Every separable L1-predual space X (over [formula]) is isometrically isomorphic to a 1-complemented subspace of the CAR algebra.

Combining a remark after Theorem [\ref=predual] with Theorem [\ref=Lusky] we deduce that the CAR algebra is strictly extremal. It turns out that the same is true for all separable non-type I [formula]-algebras.

Every separable non-type I [formula]-algebra is strictly extremal.

It follows from [\cite=Ro] that if A is a separable non-type I [formula]-algebra then the CAR algebra is isometric to a 1-complemented subspace of A. It suffices to follow the arguments of Lemma [\ref=lem1] since the CAR algebra is strictly extremal.
