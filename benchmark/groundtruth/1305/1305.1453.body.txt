Jung's Theorem and fixed points for p-uniformly convex spaces

Introduction

[\cite=bcl][\cite=kk] A metric space (X,d) is called a p-uniformly convex with parameter k > 0, if (X,d) is a geodesic space and for any three points x,y,z∈X , any minimal geodesic γ: = (γt)t∈[0,1] in X with γ0  =  x,γ1  =  y, and the midpoint m of x and y,

[formula]

By definition, putting z  =  γ0 or z = m, we see k∈(0,2] and p∈[null].

The classical Jung theorem gives an optimal upper estimate for the radius of a bounded subset of [formula] in terms of its diameter and dimention. In [\cite=ls], Lang and Schroeder also proved the similar Jung's theorem for [formula] spaces. Here we will give an upper bound for the radius of a bounded subset of p-uniformly convex spaces.

Let X be a complete p-uniformly convex space and S be a nonempty bounded subset of X. Then there exists a unique closed circumball B(z,rad(S)) of S and

[formula]

For p = 2,k = 2, our result coincides with the classical Jung theorem for [formula] spaces. Using a similar method, we can give a shorter proof of the Jung theorem of [formula] spaces [\cite=ls].

[\cite=ls] Let X be a complete [formula] space and S a nonempty bounded subset of X. In case κ > 0 assume that [formula]. Then there exists a unique closed circumball B(z,rad(S)) of S and

where [formula] is the function

A mapping T:M  →  M of a metric space (M,d) is said to be uniformly L-lipschitzian if there exists a constant L such that d(Tnx,Tny)  ≤  Ld(x,y), for all x,y∈M and [formula]. In [\cite=dks] there is a following result for [formula] spaces

[\cite=dks] Let (X,d) be a bounded complete [formula] space. Then every uniformly L-lipschitzian mapping T:X  →  X with [formula] has a fixed point.

In [\cite=gk], Baillon gave a uniformly [formula]-lipschitzian mapping of Hilbert spaces which is fixed point free.

In [\cite=l2], Lim proved a general theorem for Lp spaces

[\cite=l2] Let K be a closed convex bounded nonempty subset of Lp, 2 < p <   ∞  , then every uniformly L-lipschitzian mapping T:K  →  K with L < L0 has a fixed point. Here

[formula]

We prove similar results for p-uniformly convex spaces,

Let (X,d) be a bounded complete p-uniformly convex space with parameter k > 0. Then there exists a constant [formula] such that for every uniformly L-lipschitzian mapping T:X  →  X with L < C has a fixed point.

For [formula] spaces we have p = 2,k = 2, hence the Lifschitz constant [formula] which is coincide with the result in [\cite=dks]. For Lp spaces we have [formula], hence [formula].

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the classical Jung theorem and prove a similar one for p-uniformly convex spaces. Moreover using the same method, we can give a shorter proof for [formula] spaces. In Section 3 we show a general fixed point theorem for p-uniformly convex spaces which generalize the results in [\cite=ef][\cite=kp]. In Section 4 we prove that p-uniformly convex spaces enjoy the Property (P) which is defined by Lim and Xu. In Section 5, we generalize the result about Δ-convergence from [\cite=ef][\cite=kp] for [formula] spaces.

Jung's Theorem for p-uniformly convex space

Let (X,d) be a metric space. For a nonempty bounded subset D  ⊂  X, set

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Clearly rad(D)  ≤  diam(D)  ≤  2rad(D). Jung's theorem states that each bounded subset D of [formula] is contained in a unique closed ball with rad(D), where

[formula]

Let X be a complete geodesic p-uniformly convex space and S be a nonempty bounded subset of X. Then there exists a unique closed circumball B(z,rad(S)) of S and

[formula]

For any bounded closed subset S  ⊂  X, choose {xn}∈S such that max { lim sup n  →    ∞d(x,xn),x∈S}  =  rad(S). Now we want to show that {xn} is a Cauchy sequence. Suppose not, then there exists ε > 0 such that for any [formula] there exist i,j  ≥  N such that d(xi,xj)  ≥  ε. Choose mi as the midpoint of the segment

[formula]

, where z0 = w and wi∈S such that d(zi,wi)  ≥  rad(S). Applying to the p-uniformly convexity we have

[formula]

i.e.

[formula]

where [formula]. i.e.

[formula]

Let i  →    ∞  , we obtain

[formula]

Hence we obtain

[formula]

Now we give a shorter proof of Jung's theorem for [formula] spaces.

[\cite=ls] Let X be a complete [formula] space and S a nonempty bounded subset of X. In case κ > 0 assume that [formula]. Then there exists a unique closed circumball B(z,rad(S)) of S and

[formula]

Here we give the prove for κ = 1, - 1.

Let X be a [formula] space and x,y,z∈X such that d(x,y)  +  d(y,z)  +  d(z,x)  <  2π. Let t∈[0,1] and u is on the segment

[formula]

Let X be a [formula] space and x,y,z∈X. Let t∈[0,1] and u is on the segment

[formula]

Consider a comparison triangle [formula] and apply the [formula] inequality, we got the results.

Now we prove the Theorem [\ref=LS]

The uniqueness and existence of the circumball are directly from the result of p-uniformly convexity. Case κ = 1: for any bounded closed subset S  ⊂  X, denote z as the circumcenter of S and choose w∈S such that d(z,w) = rad(S). ut is on the segment

[formula]

Fixed points in p-uniformly convex space

We now turn to the definition of the Lifsic character of a metric space X. Balls in X are said to be c-regular if the following holds: For each k  <  c there exist μ,α∈(0,1) such that for each x,y∈X and r  >  0 with d(x,y)  ≥  (1 - μ)r, there exists z∈X such that

[formula]

The Lifshitz character L(X) of X is defined as follows:

[formula]

[\cite=ll] Let (X,d) be a bounded complete metric space. Then every uniformly L-lipschitzian mapping T:X  →  X with L  <  L(X) has a fixed point.

Let (X,d) be a bounded complete p-uniformly convex space with parameter k > 0. Then there exists a constant [formula] such that for every uniformly L-lipschitzian mapping T:X  →  X with L < C has a fixed point.

We just have to show the Lifshitz character of X

[formula]

For each x,y∈X and r  >  0 with d(x,y)  ≥  (1 - μ)r, denote

[formula]

Choose the midpoint m0 between x and y, for any z∈A applying the p-uniformly convexity, we have

[formula]

Let μ small enough such that (1 + μ)p < 1 + ε. Since (1 + μ)p + (1 - μ)p  ≥  2, we obtain (1 - μ)p  ≥  1 - ε. Hence

[formula]

Choose m1 be the midpoint between x and m0, for any z∈A applying the p-uniformly convexity again, we have

[formula]

i.e.

[formula]

Inductivly, choose mi as the midpoint of x and mi - 1. Therefore we have

[formula]

Let α  →  1,μ  →  0, we get

[formula]

i.e.

[formula]

Let i  →    ∞  , we obtain

[formula]

Hence [formula].

p-uniformly convex spaces and Property (P)

A subset A of X is said to be admissible if cov(A) = A here

[formula]

The number

[formula]

where the supremum is taken over all nonempty bounded admissible subsets A of X for which δ(A) > 0, is called the normal structure coefficient of X. If Ñ(X)  ≤  c for some constant c < 1 then X is said to have uniform normal structure.

Lim and Xu introduced the so-called property (P) for metric spaces. A metric space (X,d) is said to have property (P) if given two bounded sequences {xn} and {zn} in X, there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

The following theorem is the main result of [\cite=th]

[\cite=th] Let (X,d) be a complete bounded metric space with both property (P) and uniform normal structure. Then every uniformly L-lipschitzian mapping T:X  →  X with [formula] has a fixed point.

From Theorem [\ref=jung's_theorem], for any p-uniformly convex space X we have [formula]. Hence X has uniform normal structure. In this section we show that every complete geodesic p-uniformly convex spaces have property (P).

Let {xn} be abounded sequence in a complete geodesic p-uniformly convex space and let K be a closed and convex subset of X. Define [formula] by setting φ(x) =  lim sup n  →    ∞d(x,xn), x∈X.

There exists a unique point u∈K such that

[formula]

Let r =  inf x∈Kφ(x) and let ε > 0. Then by assumption there exists x∈K such that φ(x) < r + ε; thus for n sufficiently large d(x,xn) < r + ε, i.e., for n sufficiently large x∈B(xn,r + ε). Thus

[formula]

As the ascending union of convex sets, clearly Cε is convex. Also the closure [formula] is also convex. Therefore

[formula]

Clearly for u∈C,φ  ≤  r. Uniqueness of such a u follows from the p-uniformly convexity.

In the view of the above, X has property (P) if given two bounded sequences {xn} and {zn} in X, there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

where φ is defined as above.

A complete geodesic p-uniformly convexity has property (P).

Let {xn} and {zn} be two bounded sequences in X and define [formula] by setting φ(x) =  lim sup n  →    ∞d(x,xn), x∈X. For each n, let

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=exist] there exists a unique point un∈Cn such that

[formula]

Moreover, since zj∈Cn for j  ≥  n, φ(un)  ≤  φ(zj) for all j  ≥  n. Thus φ(un)  ≤   lim sup j  →    ∞φ(zj) for all n. We assert that {un} is a Cauchy sequence.

To see this, suppose not. Then there exists ε > 0 such that for any [formula] there exist i,j  ≥  N such that d(ui,uj)  ≥  ε. Also, since the sets {Cn} are descending, the sequence {φ(un)} is increasing. Let [formula]. Choose ξ > 0 so small that [formula], and choose N so large that [formula] if j  ≥  i  ≥  N. Let mj denote the midpoint of the geodesic joining ui and uj, and let [formula], Then by the p-uniformly convexity

[formula]

This implies

[formula]

Since mj∈Cj, this contradicts the definition of uj.

This proves that {un} is a Cauchy sequence. Consequently there exists a [formula] such that lim n  →    ∞un = z and, since φ is continuous, lim n  →    ∞φ(un) = φ(z). Hence we conclude that

[formula]

Basic properties of Δ-convergence

In this section we show that Δ-convergence can be used in p-uniformly convex spaces in a similar way as it is used in [\cite=kp] for [formula] spaces, obtaining a collection of similar results. To show this we begin with the definition of Δ-convergence.

Let X be a complete p-uniformly convex space and (xn) a bounded sequence in X. For x∈X set

[formula]

The asymptotic radius r((xn)) of (xn) is given by

[formula]

the asymptotic radius rC((xn)) with respect to C  ⊂  X of (xn) is given by

[formula]

the asymptotic center A((xn)) of (xn) is given by the set

[formula]

and the asymptotic center AC((xn)) with respect to C  ⊂  X of (xn) is given by the set

[formula]

From Proposition [\ref=exist], we have the following

Let X be a complete p-uniformly convex space, C  ⊂  X nonempty bounded, closed and convex, and (xn) a bounded sequence in X. Then AC((xn)) consists of exactly one point.

A sequence (xn) in X is said to Δ-converge to x∈X if x is the unique asymptotic center of (un) for every subsequence (un) of (xn). In this case we write Δ-lim n  →    ∞xn  =  x and call x the Δ-limit of (xn).

The next result follows as a consequence of the previous proposition.

Let X be a complete bounded p-uniformly convex space and (xn) a sequence in X. Then (xn) has a Δ-convergent subsequence.

Next we show that we can give analogs in 2-uniformly convex spaces to those other results in Section 3 of [\cite=kp] for [formula] spaces. Notice that this generalizes these results. In all the next definitions X is a 2-uniformly convex space and K  ⊂  X bounded and convex.

A mapping T:K  →  X is said to be of type Γ if there exits a continuous strictly increasing convex function [formula] with γ(0)  =  0 such that, if x,y∈K and if m and m' are the mid-points of the segments

[formula]

respectively, then

[formula]

A mapping T:K  →  X is called α-almost convex for [formula] continuous, strictly increasing, and α(0)  =  0, if for x,y∈K,

[formula]

where m is the mid-point of the segment

[formula]

A mapping T:K  →  X is said to be of convex type on K if for (xn),(yn) two sequences in K and (mn) the sequence of the mid-points of the segments

[formula]

Let K be a nonempty bounded closed convex subset of a 2-uniformly convex space X and let T:K  →  X, then the following implications hold:

[formula]

[\cite=oo] Let X be a 2-uniformly convex geodesic space with some parameter k > 0. For any x,y,z∈X, denote m as the midpoint of the segments

[formula]

Now we prove the above proposition

For the first implication, let m denote the midpoint of the segment

[formula]

. From the lemma, we have

[formula]

Thus it suffices to take [formula] to complete the first implication.

In order to prove the second implication, we have first

[formula]

Choose p as the midpoint of the segment

[formula]

We finish this section with the equivalent result of Theorem 3.14 in [\cite=kp] and [\cite=el] for p-uniformly convex spaces.

Let K be a bounded closed convex subset of X a complete p-uniformly convex space, and let T:K  →  X be continuous and of convex type. Suppose

[formula]

Then T has a fixed point in K.

Let x0∈X be fixed and define

[formula]

Since K is bounded, ρ0  <    ∞  . Moreover if ρ0 = 0 then x0∈K and T(x0) = x0 by the continuity of T. So assume that ρ0 > 0. Choose (xn)  ⊂  K such that d(xn,T(xn))  →  0 and d(xn,x0)  →  ρ0. It suffices to show that (xn) is convergent to prove the theorem. If not, then there exists a ε > 0 and subsequences (uk) and (vk) of (xn) such that d(uk,vk)  ≥  ε. Again, if necessary we may suppose [formula] and [formula]. Denote mk as the midpoint of the segment
