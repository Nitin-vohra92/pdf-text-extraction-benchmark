2-PHOTON DECAY RATE OF THE SCALAR BOSON IN THE INERT DOUBLET MODEL

Introduction

The 2-photon decay of the Standard Model (SM)-like scalar boson, being one of the most important observational channels of the SM-like scalar at the LHC, can also provide information about physics beyond the SM, because it is sensitive to the existence of new charged particles. Also existence of other new scalars can influence the signal strength because of the presence of the invisible decay channels. In this article we analyze the 2-photon decay rate in the framework of the Inert Doublet Model (IDM) [\cite=rg:2012], see also [\cite=Posch:2010], [\cite=Arhrib:2012], [\cite=Stal:2013], concentrating on the consequences of possible enhancement of this rate.

Inert Doublet Model

The IDM is an extension of the Standard Model with two scalar doublets ΦS and ΦD, interacting according to the following potential [\cite=Krawczyk:2010]:

[formula]

with all parameters real. This potential is symmetric under a discrete transformation D: ΦS  →  ΦS, ΦD  →    -  ΦD. The Yukawa interactions are also D-symmetric (only the ΦS doublet couples to fermions) and so is the vacuum state (the so-called Inert vacuum): [formula], [formula], v = 246  . Thus, the symmetry D is exact in the IDM.

The particle spectrum of the model consists of a SM-like scalar h (originating from ΦS), which has tree-level couplings to fermions and gauge bosons just like the SM scalar boson, and four dark (inert) scalars: H, A and H± (coming from ΦD), which do not couple to fermions. Due to the D-parity conservation the lightest D-odd (dark) particle is stable and thus constitutes a Dark Matter (DM) candidate, given that is electrically neutral. In this work we assume that H is the DM candidate. It has been shown that the DM coming from the IDM can be consistent with the WMAP observations only in three mass regimes: [formula], [formula] or [formula] [\cite=Dolle:2009]. We will confront this regions with the results of the Rγγ analysis.

Constraints

The numerical results presented in Section [\ref=wyniki] are obtained by scanning randomly the parameter space of the IDM taking into account the following constraints:

2-photon decay rate of the scalar boson

The 2-photon decay rate of the SM-like scalar boson is defined as follows:

[formula]

where the facts that the main production channel is via gluon fusion and that h couples (at the tree-level) to SM particles like SM scalar boson, so [formula], have been taken into account. It can be seen that deviations from Rγγ = 1 can be caused by:

is the charged scalar loop contribution, which can interfere either constructively or destructively with the SM term [formula] (for the definition of [formula] and A0 see [\cite=Djouadi:2005]).

The final value of Rγγ is a result of interplay between these two factors.

Results

Invisible channels open

In Fig. [\ref=fig] (left panel) we present the dependence of Rγγ on MH. It can be seen that when the invisible channel h  →  HH is open (for [formula]), enhancing Rγγ is impossible [\cite=Arhrib:2012]. Nonetheless, for this case any value of Rγγ up to around 0.9 can be obtained. Note, that since MH < MA,MH±, enhanced 2-photon decay rate of h can be observed only if MH,MA,MH± > Mh / 2. Therefore, if Rγγ > 1 is confirmed, light DM is excluded.

Invisible channels closed

When the invisible decay channels are kinematically closed Eq. ([\ref=rg]) reduces to:

[formula]

In this case we solved the inequality Rγγ > 1 analytically. As a result we found that the 2-photon decay rate can be enhanced only for:

[formula]

where [formula] and for obtaining the numerical values the LEP bound on the charged scalar mass MH± > 70   has been used. These two options correspond to constructive (Eq. ([\ref=constr])) or destructive (Eq. ([\ref=destr])) interference between the charged scalar loop and the SM contribution. The latter case is excluded by the condition for the existence of the Inert vacuum, Eq. ([\ref=inert-vac]). The surviving condition m222 <  - 2M2H± can be translated to the condition for the coupling between h and H+H- as λ3 < 0, see also [\cite=Arhrib:2012].

In Fig. [\ref=fig] (right panel) we present the region allowed by the constraints described in Section [\ref=warunki] in the (m222,MH±) plane. The points for which Rγγ > 1 are displayed in light green/gray. In addition, curves representing fixed values of Rγγ (calculated for the invisible channels closed) are shown. It can be observed, that the 2-photon decay rate can be enhanced for any value of the charged scalar mass. However, if Rγγ is demanded to be sharply greater than 1, then an upper limit on MH± arises. For example if Rγγ > 1.3, then MH±,MH < 135  . Joining these results with the results from Section [\ref=results-inv-open] and the LEP bound on MH± it can be seen that Rγγ > 1.3 implies:

[formula]

The bound mentioned above leaves only the medium mass regime of the DM viable.

In similar way the couplings between h and H± or H can be constrained. Demanding Rγγ > 1, we get the condition λ3,λ345 < 0, while Rγγ > 1.3 implies:

[formula]

Summary

We have analyzed the 2-photon decay rate of the SM-like scalar boson h within the framework of the IDM. Taking into account a number of constraints we have found the regions in the parameter space where this rate can be enhanced with respect to the SM case. We conclude that it is possible only if MH,MA,MH± < Mh / 2. Furthermore, if a lower bound, which is greater than one, is set on Rγγ, an upper bound on the masses of the charged scalar and the DM particle, and their couplings to h arises. For example for the case with Rγγ > 1.3 the following bounds are obtained: 70   < MH± < 135  , 62.5   < MH < 135  , - 1.46 < λ3,λ345 <  - 0.24.
