Finite difference method for the arbitrary potential in two dimensions: application to double/triple quantum dots

Introduction

The recent developments in quantum phenomena in mesoscopic systems predict many future applications of quantum devices, such as quantum information, quantum computing, next-generation logic, etc. A quantum dot with a submicron feature-size is considered as an artificial atom with a unique shell structure [\cite=Reimann2002] that can be engineered artificially by manipulating a highly-mobile two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) formed at the interface of a semiconductor heterostructure (GaAs/AlGaAs). The lateral confinement of a 2DEG is accomplished by shaping the local potential wells using gate electrodes. When two quantum dots are moved close enough to each other, they are considered as an artificial molecule that might be a candidate for a solid state quantum bit in a quantum computation [\cite=Ekert1996] [\cite=Loss1998] [\cite=Wiel2003].

The theoretical understanding on the quantized bound states and the transport properties of QDs is based on the methods of quantum mechanics developed to date, such as perturbation theory with the tight-binding Anderson model [\cite=Meir1993] [\cite=Affleck2001] [\cite=Lu2005], variational calculations [\cite=Bastard1983] [\cite=Brus1984] [\cite=LeGoff1992], the k·  p Hamiltonian method within the envelope-function approximation [\cite=Sercel1990] [\cite=Darnhofer1993] [\cite=Burt1992], density-functional theory [\cite=Lee1998], mode space approach [\cite=Wang2004], filter-diagonalization method [\cite=Ren2008], transmitting boundary method [\cite=Lent1990] [\cite=Wang1994], numerical coupled-channel method [\cite=Lin2001], and direct diagonalization techniques in finite difference scheme [\cite=Grundmann1995] [\cite=Glutsch1996] [\cite=Qu2003] [\cite=Prabhakar2009].

Regarding the realistic potentials, theoretical modeling has a weakness. For example, the experimental data [\cite=Heitmann1997] revealed the breaking of Kohn's theorem [\cite=Kohn1961]. In particular, when it comes to closely-coupled shallow QDs, it is more challenging to employ the ideal parabolic confining potential rigorously to describe each QD: a harmonic potential requires an infinite range and height. Most theoretical methods assume an ideal and symmetric model potential and often recur to the expansions or approximations using the analytic basis functions [\cite=Burkard1999] [\cite=Schliemann2001]. Numerical methods are feasible alternatives and the finite difference method (FDM) can be one of the most powerful techniques for solving real quantum systems being considered recently [\cite=Safarpour] [\cite=Sadeghi] [\cite=Li] [\cite=Gong1] [\cite=Deyasi] [\cite=Gong2] [\cite=Duque] [\cite=Chow] [\cite=Harrison] [\cite=Harrison3rd] [\cite=Hsieh] [\cite=Gimenez]. This paper reports the capability of 2D FDM by examining double QDs (DQDs) and triple QDs (TQDs) with a model potential composed of truncated parabolic potential wells. This study first reviewed the 2D FDM with a single QD with round well, and examined the level-splittings and anti-crossing behaviors of DQDs. The 2D FDM and the tight binding approach are compared quantitatively in the linear TQDs and in the triangular TQDs.

Theoretical model and validation

The FDM in 2D

In the effective-mass approximation for a arbitrary N-electron quantum dot, the single-particle Schrödinger equation can be given as

[formula]

where, [formula] is the electron effective mass, Vee is the electrostatic potential between electrons, Vb is the confining barrier potential, and Exc is the exchange-correlation energy. The Eq. (1) can be solved self-consistently by solving the Poisson eq. for Vee and by applying the Hartree or the local density approximation for Exc [\cite=Perdew1981]. When a single electron is trapped within a quantum dot with a diameter of several tens of nanometers, the carrier density is very low, ~   1012 - 1013 /cm2, and the contributions from the Vee and Exc can be neglected.

By applying a FDM to 2D regularly-spaced grid points with a grid-spacing, Δ, Eq. (1) can be approximated with a set of coupled finite difference equations,

[formula]

where γ  =  2  /  2m * Δ2, ψj,k  =  ψ(xj,yk), and Vbj,k  =  Vb(xj,yk). By aligning the grid points with indices, j & k (= 1, , N), into an one-dimensional sequence with an index [formula] (= 1, , N2) [\cite=Press1986], a large but sparse Hamiltonian matrix, H, with non-zero elements Hi,i  =  4γ  -  eVbi and Hi + N,i  =  Hi,i + N  =  Hi + 1,i  =  Hi,i + 1  =    -  γ can be obtained. In addition, the homogeneous domain is assumed to be surrounded by an impenetrable barrier, such that wavefunction vanishes outside, and HnN + 1,nN  =  HnN,nN + 1  =  0 for integer n. The Hamiltonian is a block tridiagonal matrix that can be diagonalized iteratively with the Krylov subspace method [\cite=Arnoldi1951] realized using MATLAB code. The effective mass, m* = 0.067 me, was used for an electron in GaAs. A 300×  300 nm2-area with a spatial-resolution Δ = 1 nm required ~   9  ×  104 grid-points.

Validation using a finite round well

First, the FDM was applied to a shallow quantum dot with a finite round well in 2D. This is a well-known pedagogical problem, of which the analytical solution is readily available, but is the most crucial step for legitimacy-checking and for testing the FDM code. The diameter, 2R, of the well was assumed to be 50 nm and the well was placed at the center of the 2D grids. The potential inside the well was set as a negative to allow bound states and the potential outside the domain to be set to zero, i.e. Vb(r  ≤  R) = - V0 and Vb(r  >  R) = 0. The depth of the well, V0, was varied within a range of 1-15 mV, and the energies and eigenfunctions of the bound states were calculated as functions of V0.

The calculated bound-state-energies were plotted as functions of V0 in Fig. 1(a) with symbols. As V0 was increased from zero, the bound-state-energy decreased from zero and the trajectory of the energy points formed a branch of ground-state-energies, which are denoted as E1. As V0 was increased further, the number of bound-state-energies increased and new energy-branches emerged. For shallow wells with V0  <  6 mV, only one branch appeared. For the intermediate wells with 6 mV ≤   V0 <   14 mV, three branches were found, and two of them were energy-degenerate, as indicated by E2,L and E2,H; for the deeper wells with V0 ≥   14 mV, the number of branches becomes more than five including degenerate branches. Fig. 1(b) shows the calculated eigenfunctions for the well with V0 = 15 mV with the contour plots. U1, U2,L, U2,H, U3,L, U3,H, and U4 are the eigenfunctions corresponding to the bound state energies, E1, E2,L, E2,H, E3,L, E3,H, and E4 of Fig. 1(a), respectively. The ground state wavefunction, U1, is symmetrical in the angular direction. U2,L and U2,H characterize the first excited states, which are energy-degenerate but barely distinguishable just with their eigenvalues, E2,L and E2,H. U2,L and U2,H have angular nodal lines, along ~   [formula] and its perpendicular direction [formula], respectively, as shown in Fig. 1 (b). In addition, U3,L and U3,H characterize the degenerate second excited states with similar eigenvalues, E3,L and E3,H. U3,L and U3,H have two nodal lines. Finally, the third excited state is non-degenerate and is characterized by the U4 wavefunction and with the E4 eigenvalue. U4 does not have any node along the angular direction. Instead, it has one nodal line along the radial direction around the central maximum.

The calculated bound-state-energies were compared with the analytical predictions for the same problem, which is shown with four lines in Fig. 1(a), determined from the following equation, which was obtained by the continuity of the logarithmic derivative of the wavefunction at the boundary, r = R:

[formula]

where k is the wavevector in the well determined by [formula]. Here, Jm(kr) is the Bessel function of the first kind and [formula] is the modified Bessel function of the second kind. They are proportional to the wavefunctions for the inside- and outside of the well, respectively. By solving Eq. (3), the bound-state-energy levels can be obtained for the azimuthal quantum number, m's. The lowest energy branch corresponds to the state of m  =  0. The branches for the first and second excited states correspond to m  =    ±  1 and ±  2 states, respectively. The branch for the third excited state corresponds to the higher-momentum solution with m  =  0. The physical meaning becomes more clearer by comparing the FDM eigenfunctions with the analytic eigenfunctions in the well, ~  Jm(kr)e±  imφ. The ground state eigenfunction, U1, has an asymmetric wavefunction similar to the ideal ~  J0(kr) shape in the well. The U2,L or U2,H wavefunction for the degenerate first excited state has a ~  J1(kr) cos φ or ~  J1(kr) sin φ shape with the nodal line along the ±  xy-direction. In addition, the U3,L or U3,H wavefunction for the degenerate second excited state has a [formula] or [formula] shape. The U4 wavefunction for the third non-degenerate excited state is interpreted as having a higher wavevector k than the others, such that a radial nodal line, which is characterized by the first zero of J0(kr), occurs within the well. Therefore, the FDM results reproduce the analytic predictions successfully for both eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.

The absolute energy differences, ΔE, between the numerical and analytic bound-state-energies, as shown in Fig. 1(c), reveal the limitation of the FDM; ΔE increases with increasing V0. This effect is interpreted as a numerical artifact originating from the finite momentum. To describe the exponential decay of a wavefunction correctly, one requires an infinite number of Fourier components in principle. On the other hand, numerically, it is limited by ~  2π  /  Δ, where Δ is the grid spacing used for the FDM. Such an effect becomes more evident in ΔE with a larger V0. Because the wavefunction tends to localize tightly within the well, it requires the higher momentum components. In addition, such effect is more pronounced for the degenerate excited states with non-zero m values. For V0 = 15 mV, the energy-separations between the degenerate states are separated by ~   20 μeV (between ΔE2,L and ΔE2,H) and ~   30 μeV (between ΔE3,L and ΔE3,H), which are much larger than the absolute errors, [formula] 10 μeV, for the (non-degenerate) m  =  0 states, ΔE1 and ΔE4. This effect can be attributed to the limited angular momentum of the FDM.

Results and discussion

Entanglement of the symmetric double quantum dots (DQDs)

To elucidate the interaction between the quantum states this section begins with double quantum dots (DQDs). To make two independent QDs interact with each other, the following three conditions need to be met: (i) the energy levels need to be shallow enough to have sufficient probability outside the well, (ii) the distance between QDs should be close enough, and (iii) the energy levels of each QD must be close to each other. The lateral coupling of the identical DQDs is modeled by the potential,

[formula]

which consists of two truncated harmonic wells centered at [formula] and [formula]. Each dot with the oscillator frequency, ω0, is confined spatially within a barrier radius, R0. When [formula], this model potential allows a coalesced snowman-shaped potential in the lateral DQD devices [\cite=Blick1998] [\cite=Loss2000] [\cite=Chen2004] [\cite=Hatao2005] [\cite=Petta2005]. This model is more realistic than the previous quartic potential [\cite=Burkard1999] [\cite=Schliemann2001] (of one dimensional potential of fourth order polynomial for DQDs) or series coupled-DQDs [\cite=Aguado2003] (with a simplification to tight binding model with only two parameters t and U) because the interdot tunneling, t, distance, d, and (two dimensional) size, R, can be considered separately as illustrated in Fig. 2(a). The potential disintegrates into two separate wells in the limit [formula], where [formula] is the effective Bohr radius of each dot. For each dot with R0  =  25 nm and a well-depth [formula] mV, only one bound state was permitted at the energy level of -1.160 meV and a0≃16 nm. Note that the predicted value by using an ideal (i.e. infinite range) parabolic well, Eg, ~ para  =  ω0  -  eV0≃ - 0.746 meV, deviates from the calculated level, -1.160 meV. Two identical QDs were assumed to be separated spatially with the center-to-center distance, [formula], being varied from 50 to 150 nm, i.e. ~  3a0  -  10a0.

The calculated energy levels and eigenfunctions show clear indications of molecular bonding for a small d. Fig. 2(b) shows the energies as a function of d. As d decreases from 150 nm to 50 nm, the initially (almost) degenerate energies become separated into two different levels, EB and EA, gradually. EB becomes lower and EA becomes higher than the energy level of a single QD (shown with solid line). The lower energy level, EB, is interpreted as a bonding state σ using the terms of the molecular orbital states. In contrast, the higher EA level is interpreted as an anti-bonding state, σ*. Therefore, the energy separation between EB and EA is a measure of the entanglement in the DQDs. Fig. 2(c) presents the eigenfunctions, UB and UA, corresponding to the EB and EA levels along with the contour maps, selectively for d  =  60, 80, and 120 nm. The UB function has the same sign (or phase) on both centers of QDs, i.e. it is symmetric. On the other hand, the UA function shows a sign change across a nodal line, which is in conformity with the midmost line between the QDs, i.e. it is anti-symmetric. The molecular bonding can be characterized by the population of a wavefunction at the mid-zone, and becomes more covalent with decreasing d. These features are strongly correlated with the interaction strength between QDs, as characterized by the energy separation between the EB and EA levels. Surprisingly, the entanglement is evident even at a large distance, ~  8a0≃130 nm.

Anticrossing in the asymmetric DQDs

To facilitate an interaction between QDs, the energy levels of each QD must be close to each other, but what is sufficient closeness? In addition, some applications require detuning of the energy levels between the two dots [\cite=Aono2001] [\cite=Cota2005]. To answer this question, two QDs with different atomic energy levels are required, and FDM is unquestionably the best suited for this purpose. The asymmetry in the potential can be introduced by detuning the radius R or the frequency ω of each dot. Here, a decision was made to detune the frequency. The interaction in the asymmetric DQDs was modeled by the potential,

[formula]

which consists of two harmonic wells, QD1 and QD2, with the oscillator frequencies, ω1 and ω2, respectively, centered at [formula] and [formula], with R0  =  25 nm as illustrated in Fig. 3(a). V0,1 ([formula]) was fixed to 5.0 mV, whereas V0,2 ([formula]) was varied in the range of 0-10 mV. d was also assumed constant to be 60 nm (≃4a0).

The calculated energy levels show a realistic view of generic anticrossing behavior [\cite=Wiel2003] of the asymmetric DQDs by a tunnel-coupling. Fig. 3(b) shows the molecular energy levels as functions of V0,2. As stated before, the lower energy level EB can be assigned as a bonding state and the higher EA level as an anti-bonding state. For comparison, the calculated lowest energy branch of a single isolated QD (E1,SQD) was also plotted as a function of V0,2 in a range of 2-10 mV with a solid line. The dash-dotted line shows the prediction by using an ideal (i.e. infinite range) parabolic well, [formula], which deviates again from the calculated branch at the lower V0,2 but starts to converge to it at the higher V0,2. The dashed lines depict the lowest two atomic energy levels of a single isolated QD with V0  =  5.0 mV, which are -1.160 (E01,SQD) and 0.285 (E02,SQD) meV. As V0,2 increases from zero to 5.0 mV, the lowest two energy levels of DQDs form two separate branches, EB and EA, which deviate from the atomic E01,SQD and E02,SQD levels. In particular, the EA branch rapidly follows the E1,SQD branch. For V0,2 in the range of 5-10 mV, the EB branch follows the E1,SQD branch and the EA branch converges to the atomic E01,SQD level. Therefore, the E01,SQD level and E1,SQD branch constitute asymptotic curves. The deviations of the EB and EA branches from the asymptotic curves are most clearly noticeable at V0,2s within a narrow range of ~   4.5-5.5 mV, and the deviations from the atomic levels, i.e. the degree of anticrossing behaviors, can be interpreted as a measure of entanglement. This anticrossing behaviors for the tunnel-coupled DQDs can be described most simply by the quantum mechanical two-level system [\cite=Wiel2003]. The molecular energy levels, EA and EB, can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of the uncoupled double dots and the matrix element for tunneling (t) as [formula].

The eigenfunctions, UB and UA, corresponding to the EB and EA branches, respectively, were plotted with contour maps in Fig. 3(c), selectively for V0,2 = 0.0, 1.5, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, and 10.0 mV. The UB has the same sign (or phase) on the entire domain but UA shows a sign change across a nodal curve between the QDs. The pair of perfect symmetric and anti-symmetric wavefunctions, i.e. the duo of anticrossing levels, can be found only when the depths of the two QDs are equal, i.e. V0,2 = 5.0 mV. The symmetric point can have a unique description as a static picture for the coherent charge oscillations observed in the charge qubit systems [\cite=Hayashi2003] [\cite=Gorman2005] [\cite=Koppens2006]. Therefore when time-evolution is allowed from the point, this FDM can be extended further to examine the coherent (adiabatic) dynamics of such systems with spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is possible within FDM using a unitary time-evolution operator in the Crank-Nicolson algorithm [\cite=CrankNicolson]. As asymmetry is introduced in the potentials, the molecular wavefunctions tend to localize one of the QD sites because the ground state settles at the deepest potential well. When the V0,2 is smaller (or shallower) than V0,1 (= 5.0 mV), the bonding state UB is relatively confined to the QD1 site, whereas the anti-bonding state UA is localized to the QD2 site. In addition, when the V0,2 is larger (or deeper) than the V0,1, the UB and UA moves to the QD2-site and QD1-site, respectively.

Linear triple quantum dots (LTQDs)

By placing three identical QDs at regular intervals along a straight line, we examined the linear triple QDs (LTQDs) [\cite=Hsieh]. For each QD with truncated shallow harmonic well as in the previous sections, it was assumed that V0 = 5 mV and R0 = 25 nm. Three separate bound levels were calculated using the FDM. Figure 4(a) shows the energy levels as functions of the interdot distance d.

It is intriguing to compare the FDM results with the tight-binding (TB) model calculations. When we approximate the LTQDs by using a TB model with three atomic basis wavefunctions, the TB Hamiltonian becomes

[formula]

The diagonal element, E0, defines the atomic binding energy evaluated as < a|H|a > . The off-diagonal matrix elements describe the electron overlap (or tunneling) between dots. The integrals, t1 = <  a|H|b  >   and t2 = <  a|H|c  >   are for nearest neighbor and for next-nearest neighbor, respectively. Here, |a  >  , |b  >  , and |c  >   represent the atomic eigenfunctions centered on each dot. We calculated the three TB parameters (E0, t1, and t2) as shown in Fig. 4(b), by using the FDM Hamiltonian for LTQDs and the FDM eigenfunction for an isolated QD. The three TB binding energies were evaluated as [formula] and E0  -  t2. The TB approximations reproduced the FDM results qualitatively as shown in Fig. 4(a), but their accuracy was limited.

Triangular triple quantum dots (TTQDs)

If you put in the same separation between three identical QDs in a two-dimensional plane, it becomes the triple QDs with an equilateral triangular shape [\cite=Gimenez] [\cite=Hsieh]. The energy levels of triangular triple QDs (TTQDs) as a function of interdot distance d were also examined using the FDM. When the Hamiltonian for the TTQDs were diagonalized using the FDM, two separate energy branches were obtained. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the upper branch is doubly-degenerated.

The TB Hamiltonian for the TTQDs is

[formula]

where, t = <  a|H|b  >   =<  b|H|c  >   = <  c|H|a  >   and E0 = <  a|H|a  >   represents the nearest neighbor electron tunneling and the atomic energy level. The TB binding energies were evaluated as E0  +  2t and E0  -  t (degenerated). When we write the eigenfunctions using the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO), the ground state is approximated as [formula] and the (energy-degenerate) excited states as [formula] and [formula]. The discrete (three-fold) rotation symmetry is reflected from the degenerate-excited states. The double-degeneracy is connected to the 2D nature of an electron in TTQDs, and the degeneracy can be removed by introducing an asymmetry between QDs or by applying a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane.

Conclusions

A 2D FDM applicable to realistic quantum devices with a 2D potential of arbitrary shape was developed. The results showed that the Hamiltonian for the device can be described in a tri-diagonal matrix regardless of the model potential, and can be diagonalized numerically for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. The developed method was tested quantitatively using a well-known finite round well problem. The small numerical artifacts could be analyzed as the finite size effect of linear/angular momentum. The successful applications of the 2D FDM, as a powerful technique in solving a real quantum system, were demonstrated with the DQDs and TQDs. The entanglements in lateral DQDs were modeled by a model potential with double truncated parabolic potential wells, which allows independent considerations of the interdot tunneling, interdot distance, and dot-size. The level-splittings and anticrossing behaviors of the DQDs could be obtained quantitatively with high-precision. The quantitative differences were disclosed between the 2D FDM results and the TB calculations of LTQDs and TTQDs.
