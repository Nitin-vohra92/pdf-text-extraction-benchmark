Comment on "Fringe Visibility and Which-Way Information: An Inequality"

An increasing number of recent papers that address Bohr's complementarity refer to the so-called wave-particle duality relation between "distinguishability" D and visibility V:

[formula]

Relation ([\ref=1]) was first derived by Jaeger, Shimony and Vaidman [\cite=Jaeger]. It was also derived, independently from the latter, by Englert, who employed a more straightforward approach [\cite=Englert]. This last author, besides stressing the physical meaning of ([\ref=1]), also stressed that it is logically independent of the uncertainty relation. It is thus important to make sure that the reported derivations of relation ([\ref=1]) are free from any logical or technical flaw. Unfortunately, this is not the case with Englert's derivation, which contains a slight technical flaw. The purpose of this Comment is to point out this flaw and to repair it. Neither the physical content of ([\ref=1]) nor its validity is thereby questioned.

The proof of ([\ref=1]), as presented in [\cite=Englert], is based on the following inequality:

[formula]

where [formula], |uk|  ≤  1, Dk  ≥  0, [formula]. Inequality ([\ref=12]) follows from [formula] and [formula]. In [\cite=Englert] it is claimed that because |uk|  ≤  1, the square brackets in Eq.([\ref=12]) satisfy [formula]. In such a case, [formula].

Now, [formula] does not follow from |uk|  ≤  1. Indeed, choosing, e.g., uj =  - uk = 1 we get [formula]. Thus, the lower bound in [formula] does not hold. Even though this lower bound is in fact unnecessary for proving the duality relation, the upper bound, [formula], is not obvious and should be demonstrated.

Alternatively, we can proceed as follows: [formula] implies [formula], so that [formula]. Hence,

[formula]

The square brackets in ([\ref=13]) do satisfy [formula]. Indeed, the lower bound is obvious, and the upper bound follows from the Schwarz inequality, which reads [formula] for reals ai,bi. Using this inequality we obtain

[formula]

so that we can conclude that [formula] and the duality relation is thereby proved.
