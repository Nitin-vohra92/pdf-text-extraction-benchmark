Charge form factor and sum rules of electromagnetic response functions in 12C

The current picture of the nucleus as a system of protons and neutrons interacting among themselves via two- and three-body forces and with external electroweak probes via one- and two-body currents--a dynamical framework we will refer to below as the standard nuclear physics approach (SNPA)--has been shown to reproduce satisfactorily a variety of empirical properties of light nuclei with mass number A  ≤  12, including energy spectra [\cite=Pieper:2001] [\cite=Pieper:2008] [\cite=Maris:2013] [\cite=Barrett:2013] [\cite=Roth:2011] [\cite=Jansen:2011] [\cite=Epelbaum:2010], static properties [\cite=Pieper:2001] [\cite=Marcucci:2008] [\cite=Barrett:2013] [\cite=Pastore:2013] [\cite=Maris:2013] of low-lying states, such as charge radii, and magnetic and quadrupole moments, and longitudinal electron scattering [\cite=Bacca:2009] [\cite=Bacca:2009prc]. However, it has yet to be established conclusively whether such a picture quantitatively and successfully accounts for the observed electroweak structure and response of these systems, at least those with A > 4, in a wide range of energy and momentum transfers. This issue has acquired new and pressing relevance in view of the anomaly seen in recent neutrino quasi-elastic charge-changing scattering data on 12C [\cite=Aguilar:2008], i.e., the excess, at relatively low energy, of measured cross section relative to theoretical calculations. Analyses based on these calculations have led to speculations that our present understanding of the nuclear response to charge-changing weak probes may be incomplete [\cite=Benhar:2010], and, in particular, that the momentum-transfer dependence of the axial form factor of the nucleon may be quite different from that obtained from analyses of pion electro-production data [\cite=Amaldi:1979] and measurements of neutrino and anti-neutrino reactions on protons and deuterons [\cite=Baker:1981] [\cite=Miller:1982] [\cite=Kitagaki:1983] [\cite=Ahrens:1987]. However, it should be emphasized that the calculations on which these analyses are based use rather crude models of nuclear structure--Fermi gas or local density approximations of the nuclear matter spectral function--as well as simplistic treatments of the reaction mechanism, and do not fit the picture outlined above. Conclusions based on them should therefore be viewed with caution.

The present work provides the first step towards a comprehensive study, within the SNPA, of the quasi-elastic electroweak response functions of light nuclei. We report an exact quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculation of the elastic form factor and sum rules associated with the longitudinal and transverse response functions measured in inclusive electron scattering experiments on 12C. These sum rules are defined as [\cite=Carlson:2002]

[formula]

where Rα(q,ω) is the longitudinal (α = L) or transverse (α = T) response function, q and ω are the momentum and energy transfers, ωth is the energy transfer corresponding to the inelastic threshold (the first excited-state energy is at 4.44 MeV relative to the ground state in 12C), GpE(Q2) is the proton electric form factor evaluated at four-momentum transfer Q2 = q2  -  ω2, and the Cα's are appropriate normalization factors, given by

[formula]

Here m is the nucleon mass, and Z (N) and μp (μn) are the proton (neutron) number and magnetic moment, respectively. These factors have been introduced so that Sα(q  →    ∞  )≃1 under the approximation that the nuclear charge and current operators originate solely from the charge and spin magnetization of individual protons and neutrons and that relativistic corrections to these one-body operators--such as the Darwin-Foldy and spin-orbit terms in the charge operator--are ignored.

It is well known [\cite=McVoy:1962] that the sum rules above can be expressed as ground-state expectation values of the type

[formula]

where [formula] is either the charge [formula] (α = L) or transverse current [formula] (α = T) operator divided by GpE(Q2), [formula] denotes the ground state of the nucleus recoiling with total momentum [formula], and averages over the spin projections have been suppressed because 12C has Jπ=  0+. The Sα(q) as defined in Eq. ([\ref=eq:sr]) only includes the inelastic contribution to Rα(q,ω), i.e., the elastic contribution represented by the second term on the r.h.s. of Eq. ([\ref=eq:sri]) has been removed. It is proportional to the longitudinal (FL) or transverse (FT) elastic form factor. For 12C, FT vanishes, while FL(q) (to be discussed below) is given by [formula], with the four-momentum transfer Q2el = q2  -  ω2el and ωel corresponding to elastic scattering, [formula] (mA is the 12C mass).

The sum rules Sα(q) provide a useful tool for studying integral properties of the response of the nucleus to an external electromagnetic probe, and their calculation does not require any knowledge of the complicated structure of the nuclear excitation spectrum. Unfortunately, direct comparison between the calculated and experimentally extracted sum rules cannot be made unambiguously for two reasons. First, the experimental determination of Sα requires measuring the associated Rα in the whole energy-transfer region, from threshold up to ∞  . Inclusive electron scattering experiments only allow access to the space-like region of the four-momentum transfer (ω  <  q). While the response in the time-like region (ω  >  q) could, in principle, be measured via e+e- annihilation, no such experiments have been carried out to date. Therefore, for a meaningful comparison between theory and experiment, one needs to estimate the strength outside the region covered by the experiment. We will return to this issue below. For the moment, it suffices to say that in the past this has been accomplished in the case of SL(q) either by extrapolating the data [\cite=Jourdan:1996] or, in the few-nucleon systems, by parametrizing the high-energy tail and using energy-weighted sum rules to constrain it [\cite=Schiavilla:1989] [\cite=Schiavilla:1993].

The second reason that direct comparison of theoretical and "experimental" sum rules is difficult lies in the inherent inadequacy of the current SNPA to account for explicit pion production mechanisms. The latter mostly affect the transverse response and make its Δ-peak region outside the range of applicability of this approach. However, the one- and two-body charge and current operators adopted in the present work should provide a realistic and quantitative description of both longitudinal and transverse response in the quasi-elastic region, where nucleon and (virtual) pion degrees of freedom are expected to be dominant. At low and intermediate momentum transfers ([formula] MeV/c), the quasi-elastic and Δ-peak are well separated, and it is therefore reasonable to study sum rules of the transverse response.

The ground-state wave function of 12C is obtained from a Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) solution of the Schrödinger equation including the Argonne v18 (AV18) two-nucleon (N N) [\cite=Wiringa:1995] and Illinois-7 (IL7) three-nucleon (N N N) [\cite=Pieper:2008] potentials. The AV18 consists of a long-range component induced by one-pion exchange (OPE) and intermediate-to-short range components modeled phenomenologically, and fits the N N scattering database for energies up to Elab = 350 MeV with a χ2 per datum close to one. The IL7 includes a central (albeit isospin dependent) short-range repulsive term and two- and three-pion-exchange mechanisms involving excitation of intermediate Δ resonances. Its strength is determined by four parameters which are fixed by a best fit to the energies of 17 low-lying states of nuclei in the mass range A  ≤  10, obtained in combination with the AV18 N N potential. As already noted, the AV18+IL7 Hamiltonian reproduces well the spectra of nuclei with [formula] [\cite=Pieper:2008]--in particular, the attraction provided by the Illinois N N N potentials in isospin 3/2 triplets is crucial for the p-shell nuclei--and the p-wave resonances with Jπ = (3 / 2)- and (1 / 2)- in low-energy neutron scattering off 4He [\cite=Nollett:2007].

The 12C ground state wave function is evolved in imaginary time by GFMC from a variational (VMC) wave function that contains both explicit alpha clustering and the five possible Jπ=0+ p-shell states. These are multiplied by two- and three-body non-central correlations [\cite=Pudliner:1997]. Our ground-state energy and RMS charge radius are  MeV and 2.46(2) fm, respectively, in good agreement with the experimental values of  MeV and (2.471  ±  0.005) fm [\cite=Sick:1982].

Realistic models for the electromagnetic charge and current operators include one- and two-body terms (see Ref. [\cite=Shen:2012] for a recent overview). The former follow from a non-relativistic expansion of the single-nucleon four-current, in which corrections proportional to 1 / m2 are retained. Leading two-body terms are derived from the static part of the N N potential (the AV18 in the present case), which is assumed to be due to exchanges of effective pseudo-scalar (π-like) and vector (ρ-like) mesons. The corresponding charge and current operators are constructed from non-relativistic reductions of Feynman amplitudes with the π-like and ρ-like effective propagators projected out of the central, spin-spin and tensor components of the N N potential. They contain no free parameters, and their short-range behavior is consistent with that of the potential. In particular, the longitudinal part of these two-body currents satisfies, by construction, current conservation with the (static part of the) N N potential. Additional contributions--purely transverse and hence unconstrained by current conservation--come from M1-excitation of Δ resonances treated perturbatively in the intermediate state (for the current) and from the ρπγ transition mechanism (for the charge and current). For these, the values of the various coupling constants are taken from experiment [\cite=Shen:2012]. As documented in Refs. [\cite=Carlson:2002] [\cite=Carlson:1998] [\cite=Marcucci:2005], these charge and current operators reproduce quite well a variety of few-nucleon electromagnetic observables, ranging from elastic form factors to low-energy radiative capture cross sections to the quasi-elastic response in inclusive [formula] scattering at intermediate energies.

The spin-orbit and convection terms in [formula] and [formula] require gradients of both the bra and ket in Eq. ([\ref=eq:sri]); however, we cannot compute gradients of the evolved GFMC wave function. Therefore we compute these terms for only the VMC wave function and add them perturbatively to the GFMC results. They are generally quite small, although the convection term is significant for small q, see Fig. [\ref=fig:f3] below.

The calculations were made on Argonne's IBM Blue Gene/Q (Mira). Our GFMC program uses the Asynchronous Dynamic Load Balancing (ADLB) library [\cite=Lusk:2010] to achieve parallelization to more than 250,000 MPI processes with 80% efficiency to calculate the energy. The calculations of operators presented here require much more memory than just the energy evaluation and we typically used four MPI processes on each 16 Gbyte node. We achieve good OpenMP scaling in each process: using 16 threads (the most possible) instead of only 4 reduces the time per configuration per q-value from about 12 to 6 minutes. For each Monte Carlo configuration, we averaged over 12 directions of [formula] in Eq. ([\ref=eq:sri]); these were in four groups of three orthogonal directions obtained by implementing the method of uniformly distributed random rotations on a unit sphere [\cite=Arvo:1992]. The 12 calculations for each of 21 magnitudes of q (252 independent calculations) were distributed to different MPI processes by ADLB, with an efficiency above 95% on more than 32,000 MPI processes.

The calculated longitudinal elastic form factor (FL) of 12C is compared to experimental data in Fig. [\ref=fig:f1]. These data are from an unpublished compilation by Sick [\cite=Sick:2013] [\cite=Sick:1982], and are well reproduced by theory over the whole range of momentum transfers. The results labeled one-body (1b) include, in addition to the proton, the neutron contribution as well as the Darwin-Foldy and spin-orbit relativistic corrections to the single-nucleon charge operator, while those labeled two-body (2b) also contain the contributions due to the π-like, ρ-like, and ρπγ (two-body) charge operators. These two-body contributions are negligible at low q, and become appreciable only for q  >  3 fm- 1, where they interfere destructively with the one-body contributions bringing theory into closer agreement with experiment. The Simon [\cite=Simon:1980], Galster [\cite=Galster:1971], and Höhler [\cite=Hohler:1976] parametrizations are used for the proton electric, neutron electric, and proton and neutron magnetic form factors, respectively.

In Figs. [\ref=fig:f2] and [\ref=fig:f3], we show by the open squares the experimental sum rules SL(q) and ST(q) obtained by integrating up to ω max the longitudinal and transverse response functions (divided by the square of GpE) extracted from world data on inclusive [formula] scattering off 12C [\cite=Jourdan:1996]. For q=1.53, 1.94, and 2.90 fm- 1, ω max in the longitudinal (transverse) case corresponds to, respectively, 140, 210, and 345 (140, 180, 285) MeV. We also show by the solid squares the experimental sum rules obtained by estimating the contribution of strength in the region ω  >  ω max. This estimate ΔSα(q) is made by assuming that for ω  >  ω max, i.e., well beyond the quasi-elastic peak, the (longitudinal or transverse) response in a nucleus like 12C (RAα) is proportional to that in the deuteron (R  dα), which can be accurately calculated [\cite=Shen:2012]. In particular, R  dα has been calculated using AV18, but very similar results are obtained by using N3LO [\cite=Entem:2003] instead. Thus, we set RAα(q,ω  >  ω max)  =  λ(q)  R  dα(q,ω), and determine λ(q) by matching the experimental 12C response to the calculated deuteron one. In practice, ΔSα(q) follows from

[formula]

where the CAα and Cdα are the normalization factors associated with the nucleus and deuteron, respectively, and Sdα(q) is the deuteron sum rule. It is worthwhile emphasizing that, for the transverse case, this estimate is particularly uncertain for the reasons explained earlier. In particular, the data on RT at q=1.94 and 2.90 fm- 1 [\cite=Jourdan:1996] suggest that at ω  ~  ω max there might be already significant strength that has leaked in from the Δ-peak region.

The scaling assumption above assumes that the high-energy part of the response is dominated by two-nucleon physics, and that the most important contribution is from deuteron-like np pairs. The high-energy response can be obtained from the Fourier transform of the short-time response [formula], or equivalently from the small imaginary time-dependence of the propagator. At short times the full propagator is governed by the product of pair propagators (assuming three-nucleon interactions are weak), and hence we expect the scaling with deuteron-like pairs.

The sum rules computed with the AV18+IL7 Hamiltonian and one-body only or one- and two-body terms in the charge (SL) and current (ST) operators are shown, respectively, by the dashed and solid lines in Figs. [\ref=fig:f2]-[\ref=fig:f3]. In the small q limit, SL(q) vanishes quadratically, while the divergent behavior in ST(q) is due to the 1 / q2 present in the normalization factor CT. In this limit, [formula] [\cite=Carlson:1998] [\cite=Marcucci:2005], where H is the Hamiltonian and Pi is the proton projector, and therefore ST(q) / CT is finite, indeed the associated strength is due to collective excitations of electric-dipole type in the nucleus. In the large q limit, the one-body sum rules differ from one because of relativistic corrections in [formula], primarily the Darwin-Foldy term which gives a contribution -  η / (1 + η) to S1bL(q), where η≃q2 / (4  m2), and because of the convection term in [formula], which gives a contribution ≃(4 / 3)  CT  Tp / m to S1bT(q), where Tp is the proton kinetic energy in the nucleus.

The calculated SL(q) is in satisfactory agreement with the experimental values, including tail contributions, and no significant quenching of longitudinal strength is observed. Since the experimental RL(q,ω) is divided out by the (square of the) free proton electric form factor, one is led to conclude that there is no evidence for in-medium modifications of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors, as advocated, for example, by the quark-meson coupling model of nucleon and nuclear structure [\cite=Lu:1999] [\cite=Guichon:2004].

In contrast to SL, the transverse sum rule has large two-body contributions--at q = 2.5 fm- 1; these increase S1bT by about 50%. Studies of Euclidean transverse response functions in the few-nucleon systems within the same SNPA adopted here [\cite=Carlson:2002] suggest that a significant portion of this excess transverse strength is in the quasi-elastic region. Clearly, a direct QMC calculation of the 12C response functions is needed to resolve this issue conclusively. It will also be interesting to see the extent to which these considerations--in particular, the major role played by two-body currents--will remain valid in the weak sector probed in neutrino scattering, and possibly provide an explanation for the observed 12C anomaly mentioned in the introduction.
