Multiplicity one for L-functions and applications

Introduction

An L-function is a Dirichlet series that converges absolutely in some right half plane, has a meromorphic continuation to a function of order 1, with finitely many poles, satisfies a functional equation, and admits an Euler product. For example, the (incomplete) L-functions attached to tempered, cuspidal automorphic representations, or the Hasse-Weil L-functions attached to non-singular, projective, algebraic varieties defined over a number field, conjecturally satisfy these conditions.

In this paper, using standard techniques from analytic number theory, we prove a strong multiplicity one result for such L-functions (without reference to any underlying automorphic or geometric object). We closely follow the work [\cite=KP] and we redo their arguments for two reasons. First, our results are more general in that they have slightly weaker hypotheses. Second, we think that the techniques should be better known, especially to those who study L-functions automorphically.

One of the defining axioms for the class of L-functions we consider is the existence of an Euler product. There exists a number d, called the degree of the L-function, such that the local Euler factor is of the form Qp(p- s)- 1, where Qp(X) is a polynomial satisfying Qp(0) = 1, and Qp(X) has degree d for almost all primes. We say that a given L-function satisfies the Ramanujan conjecture, if the roots of Qp are of absolute value at least 1, for all p.

The multiplicity one results we discuss in this paper are statements which assert that if two L-functions are sufficiently close, then they must be equal. A model example is:

Suppose [formula] and [formula] are Dirichlet series which continue to meromorphic functions of order 1 satisfying appropriate functional equations and having appropriate Euler products. Assume that L1(s) and L2(s) satisfy the Ramanujan conjecture. Assume also that a1(p) = a2(p) for almost all p. Then L1(s) = L2(s).

The precise conditions on the functional equation and Euler product are described in Section [\ref=sec:Ldefinition]. A weaker version of Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMOintro], requiring equality of the local Euler factors instead of the pth Dirichlet coefficients, is given in [\cite=RudSar]. Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMOintro] is also a consequence of the main result in [\cite=KP]. The result we will actually prove, Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMO], is stronger. First, instead of requiring equality of the pth Dirichlet series coefficients, we only require that they are close on average. Second, the Ramanujan hypothesis can be slightly relaxed.

We will present three applications of strong multiplicity one for L-functions. The first application is to cuspidal automorphic representations of [formula], where [formula] denotes the ring of adeles of the number field [formula]. Any such representation π factors as [formula], where πp is an irreducible admissible representation of [formula] (we mean [formula] for p =   ∞  ). Attached to π is an automorphic L-function L(s,π), whose finite part is [formula]. The completion of Lfin(s,π) is known to be "nice", and hence Lfin(s,π) is the kind of function to which Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMOintro] applies. At almost all primes p we have L(s,πp) =  det (1 - A(πp)p- s)- 1, where [formula] is a diagonal matrix whose entries are the Satake parameters at p. The Ramanujan conjecture is the assertion that each πp is tempered, which in this context implies that |αj,p| = 1. In particular note that L(s,πp) is a polynomial in p- s and this polynomial has all its roots on the unit circle.

An easy consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMOintro] is the following.

Suppose that π and π' are (unitary) cuspidal automorphic representations of [formula] satisfying [formula] for almost all p. Assume that both Lfin(s,π) and Lfin(s,π') satisfy the Ramanujan conjecture. Then π  =  π'.

Most statements of strong multiplicity one in the literature are phrased in terms of A(πp) and A(πp') being conjugate, instead of the much weaker condition of the equality of their traces. Using the stronger version of Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMOintro], we will in fact prove a stronger result which only requires that the traces are close enough on average; see Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMOgln] for the precise statement.

Our second application is to Siegel modular forms of degree 2. For such modular forms Weissauer [\cite=W] has proved the Ramanujan conjecture. The Dirichlet coefficients ai(p) appearing in Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMOintro] are essentially the Hecke eigenvalues for the Hecke operator T(p). We therefore have the following:

Suppose Fj, for j = 1,2, are Siegel Hecke eigenforms of weight kj for [formula], with Hecke eigenvalues μj(n). If p3 / 2 - k1μ1(p) = p3 / 2 - k2μ2(p) for all but finitely many p, then k1  =  k2 and F1,F2 have the same eigenvalues for the Hecke operator T(n) for all n.

The remarkable fact here is that the Hecke operator T(p) alone does not generate the local Hecke algebra at p. This Hecke algebra is generated by T(p) and T(p2). The fact that the coincidence of the eigenvalues for T(p) is enough is of course a global phenomenon. Using the result of [\cite=Sa], we see that if Böcherer's conjecture is true then not only are the Hecke eigenvalues of F1,F2 in Theorem [\ref=thm:m1siegelintro] equal but we get F1  =  F2. Again, using the averaged version of Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMO], we can prove a stronger result; see Theorem [\ref=thm:m1siegel].

Our third application concerns the Hasse-Weil zeta function of hyperelliptic curves; see Proposition [\ref=hyperXYprop]. This Proposition is in a similar spirit to those mentioned above. Assuming the L-functions satisfy a functional equation of a form they are expected to satisfy, we can apply our analytic theorems to prove a result about the underlying (in this case) geometric object.

Notation

We review some notation from analytic number theory for completeness. Given two functions f(x),  g(x),

we write f(x)  ~  g(x) as x  →    ∞   if lim x  →    ∞f(x) / g(x) = 1;

we write f(x)  ≪  g(x) as x  →    ∞   if there exists C > 0 and x0 > 0 so that if x  >  x0 then |f(x)|  ≤  C|g(x)|; this is also written as f(x) = O(g(x)) as x  →    ∞  .

In this paper we drop the phrase "as x  →    ∞  " when using the above notation.

Multiplicity one for L-functions

In this section we describe the L-functions for which we will prove a multiplicity one result. As in other approaches to L-functions viewed from a classical perspective, such as that initiated by Selberg [\cite=Sel], we consider Dirichlet series with a functional equation and an Euler product. However, in contrast to Selberg, we strive to make all our axioms as specific as possible. Presumably (as conjectured by Selberg) these different axiomatic approaches all describe the same objects: L(s,π) where π is a cuspidal automorphic representation of GL(n).

L-function background

Before getting to L-functions, we recall two bits of terminology that will be used in the following discussion. An entire function [formula] is said to have order at most α if for all ε  >  0:

[formula]

Moreover, we say f has order equal to α if f has order at most α, and f does not have order at most γ for any γ  <  α. The notion of order is relevant because functions of finite order admit a factorization as described by the Hadamard Factorization Theorem and the Γ-function and L-functions are all of order 1.

In order to ease notation, we use the normalized Γ-functions defined by:

[formula]

An L-function is a Dirichlet series

[formula]

where s = σ + it is a complex variable. We assume that L(s) converges absolutely in the half-plane σ > 1 and has a meromorphic continuation to all of [formula]. The resulting function is of order 1, admitting at most finitely many poles, all of which are located on the line σ  =  1. Finally, L(s) must have an Euler product and satisfy a functional equation as described below.

The functional equation involves the following parameters: a positive integer N, complex numbers [formula] and [formula], and a complex number ε. The completed L-function

[formula]

is a meromorphic function of finite order, having the same poles as L(s) in σ > 0, and satisfying the functional equation

[formula]

The number d = J + 2K is called the degree of the L-function.

We require some conditions on the parameters μj and νj. The temperedness condition is the assertion that [formula] and [formula] a positive integer or half-integer. With those restrictions, there is only one way to write the parameters in the functional equation, as proved in Proposition [\ref=prop:smoL]. This restriction is not known to be a theorem for most automorphic L-functions. In order to state theorems which apply in those cases, we will make use of a "partial Selberg bound," which is the assertion that [formula].

The Euler product is a factorization of the L-function into a product over the primes:

[formula]

where Fp is a polynomial of degree at most d:

[formula]

If p|N then p is a bad prime and the degree of Fp is strictly less than d, in other words, αj,p = 0 for at least one j. Otherwise, p is a good prime, in which case the αj,p are called the Satake parameters at p. The Ramanujan bound is the assertion that at a good prime |αj,p| = 1, and at a bad prime |αj,p|  ≤  1.

The Ramanujan bound has been proven in very few cases, the most prominent of which are holomorphic forms on GL(2) and GSp(4). See [\cite=Sar] for a survey of what progress is known towards proving the Ramanujan bound. Also see [\cite=BB].

We write |αj,p|  ≤  pθ, for some [formula], to indicate progress toward the Ramanujan bound, referring to this as a "partial Ramanujan bound."

We will need to use symmetric and exterior power L-functions associated to a L-function L(s). Let S be the finite set of bad primes p of L(s). The partial symmetric and exterior square L-functions are defined as follows.

[formula]

[formula]

We do not define the local Euler factors at the bad primes since there is no universal recipe for these. It is conjectured that the symmetric and exterior power L-functions are in fact L-functions in the sense described above. In that case, Proposition [\ref=prop:smoL] tells us that the bad Euler factors are uniquely determined. For applications that we present in this paper, the partial L-functions suffice.

In most cases it is not necessary to specify the local factors at the bad primes because, by almost any version of the strong multiplicity one theorem, an L-function is determined by its Euler factors at the good primes. For completeness we state a simple version of the result.

In the following proposition we use the term "L-function" in a precise sense, referring to a Dirichlet series which satisfies a functional equation of the form [\eqref=eqn:Lambda]-[\eqref=eqn:FE] with the restrictions [formula] and [formula] a positive integer or half-integer, and having an Euler product satisfying [\eqref=eqn:EP]-[\eqref=eqn:EPpolynomial]. We refer to the quadruple [formula] as the functional equation data of the L-function.

Suppose that [formula], for j = 1,2, are L-functions which satisfy a partial Ramanujan bound for some [formula]. If Fp,1 = Fp,2 for all but finitely many p, then Fp,1 = Fp,2 for all p, and L1 and L2 have the same functional equation data.

In particular, the proposition shows that the functional equation data of an L-function is well defined. There are no ambiguities arising, say, from the duplication formula of the Γ-function. Also, we remark that the partial Ramanujan bound is essential. One can easily construct counterexamples to the above proposition using Saito-Kurokawa lifts, which do not satisfy the partial Ramanujan bound.

Let Λj(s) be the completed L-function of Lj(s) and consider

[formula]

By the assumption on Fp,j, the product over p is really a finite product. Thus, [\eqref=eqn:lambda] is a valid expression for λ(s) for all s.

By the partial Ramanujan bound and the assumptions on μj and νj, we see that λ(s) has no zeros or poles in the half-plane [formula]. But by the functional equations for L1 and L2 we have [formula]. Thus, λ(s) also has no zeros or poles in the half-plane [formula]. Since [formula], we conclude that λ(s) has no zeros or poles in the entire complex plane.

If the product over p in [\eqref=eqn:lambda] were not empty, then the fact that { log (p)} is linearly independent over the rationals implies that λ(s) has infinitely many zeros or poles on some vertical line. Thus, Fp,1 = Fp,2 for all p.

The Γ-factors must also cancel identically, because the right-most pole of [formula] is at -  μ, and the right-most pole of [formula] is at -  ν. This leaves possible remaining factors of the form [formula], but that also has poles because the [formula] factor cancels the first pole of the [formula] factor, but not the second pole. Note that the restriction [formula] is a critical ingredient in this argument.

This leaves the possibility that λ(s) = (N1 / N2)s / 2, but such a function cannot satisfy the functional equation [formula] unless N1 = N2 and ε1  =  ε2.

The strong multiplicity one theorem for L-functions

In this section we state a version of strong multiplicity one for L-functions which is stronger than Proposition [\ref=prop:smoL] because it only requires the Dirichlet coefficients a(p) and a(p2) to be reasonably close. This is a significantly weaker condition than equality of the local factor.

Although the main ideas behind the proof appear in Kaczorowski-Perelli [\cite=KP] and Soundararajan [\cite=S], we give a slightly stronger version which assumes a partial Ramanujan bound [formula], plus an additional condition, instead of the full Ramanujan conjecture. We provide a self-contained account because we also wish to bring awareness of these techniques to people with a more representation-theoretic approach to L-functions.

Suppose L1(s), L2(s) are Dirichlet series with Dirichlet coefficients a1(n), a2(n), respectively, which continue to meromorphic functions of order 1 satisfying functional equations of the form [\eqref=eqn:Lambda]-[\eqref=eqn:FE] with a partial Selberg bound [formula] for both functions, and having Euler products satisfying [\eqref=eqn:EP]-[\eqref=eqn:EPpolynomial]. Assume a partial Ramanujan bound for some [formula] holds for both functions, and that the Dirichlet coefficients at the primes are close to each other in the sense that

[formula]

We have L1(s) = L2(s) if either of the following two conditions are satisfied

[formula].

For each of L1(s) and L2(s), separately, any one of the following holds:

The Ramanujan bound θ = 0.

The partial symmetric square ([\ref=partial-sym-defn]) of the function has a meromorphic continuation past the σ = 1 line, and only finitely many zeros or poles in σ  ≥  1.

The partial exterior square ([\ref=partial-ext-defn]) of the function has a meromorphic continuation past the σ = 1 line, and only finitely many zeros or poles in σ  ≥  1.

Note that condition [\eqref=eqn:apequal] is satisfied if [formula], in particular, if a1(p) = a2(p) for all but finitely many p, or more generally if a1(p) = a2(p) for all but a sufficiently thin set of primes. In particular, a1(p) and a2(p) can differ at infinitely many primes. Also, by the prime number theorem [\cite=Ap] in the form

[formula]

condition [\ref=rama0]) for both L-functions implies condition [\ref=ramaaverage]).

The condition [formula] arises from the p- 3s terms in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:factorL]. Those terms do not seem to give rise to a naturally occuring L-function at 3s, so it may be difficult to replace the [formula] condition by a statement about the average of certain Dirichlet coefficients.

Some technical lemmas

In this section we provide the lemmas required for the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMO]. There are two types of lemmas we require. The first deals with manipulating Euler products and establishing zero-free half-planes via the convergence of those products. The second deals with possible zeros at the edge of the half-plane of convergence.

Coefficients of related L-functions

If [formula] then for [formula] or [formula] we write

[formula]

If p is a good prime then

[formula],

[formula],

[formula], and

[formula].

Let p be a good prime. Expanding the Euler factor Lp(s) for L(s) we have

[formula]

where the nj are restricted to non-negative integers. Expanding the Euler factor for [formula] we have

[formula]

The coefficient of p- s in [\eqref=eqn:symnexpand] is

[formula]

which equals the coefficient of p- ns in [\eqref=eqn:sym1expand].

The other identities in the lemma just involve expanding the definitions and checking particular coefficients.

Manipulating L-functions

The next lemma tells us that if there are zeros in the critical strip for [formula], these zeros come from Euler factors involving the coefficients a(p) or a(p2) of the Dirichlet series or the Euler factors of the symmetric or exterior square L-functions.

Suppose

[formula]

where |αj,p|  ≤  pθ for some [formula]. Then for σ  >  1 + θ,

[formula]

where hj(s) is regular and nonvanishing for [formula].

We can write the Euler product in the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

with the implied constant depending only on ε. We manipulate the Euler product, introducing coefficients Aj, and Bj where Aj(p),Bj(p)  ≪  jpjθ  ≪  pj(θ  +  ε). We have

[formula]

say. Note that by the assumptions on Aj and Bj we have

[formula]

Combining this with [\eqref=eqn:apjbound] justifies [\eqref=eqn:factorEP].

For the first assertion, set Aj(p) = 0 and Bj(p) = 0 and note that F1(s) converges absolutely for σ > 1 + θ and F2(s) converges absolutely for [formula], and F3(s) converges absolutely for [formula].

For the second assertion, set Aj(p) = 0. For good primes p, choose Bj(p) so that [formula]. For bad primes p, choose Bj(p)  =  0. Note that (by the construction of the symmetric square) this choice of Bj satisfies the required bounds. The finitely many factors at the bad primes together with F3(s) give h1(s).

For the third assertion, the only modification is to set A2(p) = a(p)2, Aj(p) = 0 for j  ≥  3, and use the second identity in Lemma [\ref=lem:coefficientidentities] and appropriate choices for Bj(p) so that [formula].

Zeros at the edge of the half-plane of convergence

The absolute convergence of an Euler product in a half-plane σ  >  σ0 implies that the function has no zeros or poles in that region. If the Euler product has a meromorphic continuation to a larger region, it could possibly have zeros or poles on the σ0-line. The lemma in this section, which is standard and basically follows the proof of Lemma 1 of [\cite=KP], says that if the Dirichlet coefficients a(p) are small on average then there are finitely many zeros or poles on the σ0-line. Our modification is that we only require the L-function to satisfy a partial Ramanujan bound.

Note that the lemma is stated with σ0 = 1 as the boundary of convergence. Applying the lemma in contexts with a different line of convergence, as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMO], just involves a simple change of variables s  →  s + A.

Let

[formula]

and suppose there exists M1,M2  ≥  0 and [formula] so that |a(pj)|  ≪  pθj and

[formula]

Then L(s) is a nonvanishing analytic function in the half-plane σ > 1. Furthermore, if L(s) has a meromorphic continuation to a neighborhood of σ  ≥  1, then L(s) has at most (M1  +  2M2)2 zeros or poles on the σ = 1 line.

Note that, by the prime number theorem ([\ref=PNT]), the condition [\eqref=eqns:apbounds1] on a(p) is satisfied if |a(p)|  ≤  M1. Also, if [formula] then condition [\eqref=eqns:apbounds2] on a(p2) holds with M2 = 1.

The proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:M2zerosimproved] is in Section [\ref=sec:M2zerosimprovedproof].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMO]

Now we have the ingredients to prove Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMO]. The proof begins the same as that of Proposition [\ref=prop:smoL], by considering the ratio of completed L-funtions:

[formula]

which is a meromorphic function of order 1 and satisfies the functional equation [formula], where ε  =  ε1  /  ε2.

λ(s) has only finitely many zeros or poles in the half-plane [formula].

Assuming the lemma, we complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMO] as follows. By the functional equation, λ(s) has only finitely many zeros or poles, so by the Hadamard factorization theorem

[formula]

where r(s) is a rational function.

By [\eqref=eqn:exprat], as σ  →    ∞  ,

[formula]

for some [formula] and [formula]. On the other hand, if b(n0) is the first non-zero Dirichlet coefficient (with n0 > 1) of L1(s) / L2(s), then by [\eqref=eqn:Lambdaratio] and Stirling's formula, as σ  →    ∞  ,

[formula]

Comparing those two asymptotic formulas, the leading terms must be equal, so B0 = C0, B1 = m0, B2 = 0, and B3 = A. Comparing second terms, we have polynomial decay equal to exponential decay, which is impossible unless b(n0) = 0 and C1 = 0. But b(n0) was the first nonzero coefficient of L1(s) / L2(s), so we conclude that L1(s) = L2(s), as claimed.

The rest of this section is devoted to the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:mainlemma]. By [\eqref=eqn:lambda] and the partial Selberg bound assumed on μ and ν, only the product

[formula]

could contribute any zeros or poles to λ(s) in the half-plane [formula].

By the first line in equation [\eqref=eqn:Lfactored] of Lemma [\ref=lem:factorL] we have

[formula]

say, where H1(s) is regular and nonvanishing for [formula].

Assuming [formula], bound [\eqref=eqn:apequal], and condition [\ref=ramaaverage]) in Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMO], with A1(s) as defined in [\eqref=eqn:firstlambda] we have

[formula]

where H2(s) is regular and nonvanishing for [formula].

We finish the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:mainlemma] and then conclude with the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:quotientdifference].

Using the notation of Lemma [\ref=lem:quotientdifference], write [\eqref=eqn:quotientdifference] as A1(s) = A2(s)H2(s). Since A1(s) and H2(s) are meromorphic in a neighborhood of [formula], so is A2(s). Changing variables [formula], which divides the nth Dirichlet coefficient by [formula], we can apply Lemma [\ref=lem:M2zerosimproved], using the estimate [\eqref=eqn:apequal] and condition [\ref=ramaaverage]) to conclude that A2(s) has only finitely many zeros or poles in [formula]. Since the same is true of H1(s) and H2(s), we have shown that P(s) has only finitely many zeros or poles in [formula]. This completes the proof for conditions [\ref=rama0]) and [\ref=ramaaverage]).

In the other cases, the proof is almost the same, using Lemma [\ref=lem:factorL] to rewrite equation [\eqref=eqn:firstlambda] in terms of [formula] or [formula], and using Lemma [\ref=lem:M2zerosimproved] for the factors that remain. This concludes the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:mainlemma].

Proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:quotientdifference]. Using the identities

[formula]

and

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

say. We wish to apply Lemma [\ref=lem:M2zerosimproved] to show that h(s) is regular and nonvanishing for σ  >  σ0 for some [formula]. Since [formula], if [formula] and p  >  P0 where P0 depends only on θ, then [formula] and [formula]. Using those inequalities and |a2(p)|  ≪  pθ we have

[formula]

Changing variables [formula] and applying Lemma [\ref=lem:M2zerosimproved], we see that h(s) is regular and nonvanishing for [formula].

Applying the same reasoning to the second factor in [\eqref=eqn:quotientdifference] completes the proof.

Proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:M2zerosimproved]

Two basic results which are used in this section are:

If [formula] for every ε > 0, then [formula] converges absolutely for all σ > 1.

If [formula] as X  →    ∞  , then

[formula]

as σ  →  1+.

Both of those results follow by partial summation.

We first state and prove a simplified version of Lemma [\ref=lem:M2zerosimproved].

Let

[formula]

and suppose there exists M  ≥  0 and [formula] so that |a(pj)|  ≪  pjθ and

[formula]

Then L(s) is a nonvanishing analytic function in the half-plane σ > 1. Furthermore, if L(s) has a meromorphic continuation to a neighborhood of [formula], then L(s) has at most M2 zeros or poles on the σ = 1 line.

Note that, by the prime number theorem ([\ref=PNT]), the condition on a(p) is satisfied if |a(p)|  ≤  M.

We have

[formula]

say, where b(pj)  ≪  jMjpjθ  ≪  pj(θ  +  ε) for any ε > 0.

Writing [\eqref=eqn:Lfactoredagain] as L(s) = f(s)g(s) we have

[formula]

where [formula]. Now,

[formula]

If [formula] we have |Y|  ≪  1 / p1 + δ for some δ > 0. Therefore the series [\eqref=eqn:loggsum] for log (g(s)) converges absolutely for [formula], so g(s) is a nonvanishing analytic function in that region. By [\eqref=eqn:apsumM2], Cauchy's inequality, and Lemma [\ref=lem:converge], f(s) is a nonvanishing analytic function for σ > 1, so the same is true for L(s). This establishes the first assertion in the lemma.

Now we consider the zeros of L(s) on σ = 1. Since [formula], the zeros or poles of L(s) on the σ = 1 line are the zeros or poles of f(s). Furthermore, by [\eqref=eqn:Lfactoredagain] and the properties of g(s), for σ > 1 we have

[formula]

where h(s) is bounded in [formula] for any ε > 0. Suppose [formula] are zeros or poles of L(s), with sj  =  1 + itj having multiplicity mj. We have

[formula]

therefore

[formula]

Now write

[formula]

By [\eqref=eqn:klimit] we have

[formula]

On the other hand, for σ > 1 we have

[formula]

On the first line we used the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, on the next-to-last line we wrote the sum over a(p) as a Stieltjes integral and used [\eqref=eqn:apsumM2] and Lemma [\ref=lem:bound], and on the last line we used the fact that the Riemann zeta function has a simple pole at s = 1 and no other zeros or poles on the σ = 1 line.

Combining [\eqref=eqn:klimit] and [\eqref=eqn:kbound] we have [formula]. Since m2j  ≥  1, we see that J  ≤  M2, as claimed.

The proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:M2zerosimproved] is similar to Lemma [\ref=lem:M2zeros].

We have

[formula]

say.

We have c(pj)  ≪  jMjpjθ  ≪  pj(θ  +  ε) for any ε > 0. We use this to show that g(s) is a nonvanishing analytic function in [formula]. Writing [formula] we have

[formula]

where [formula]. Now,

[formula]

If [formula] we have |Y|  ≪  1 / p1 + δ for some δ > 0. Therefore by Lemma [\ref=lem:converge] the series [\eqref=eqn:loggsum2] for log (g(s)) converges absolutely for [formula], so g(s) is a nonvanishing analytic function in that region. By the same argument, using [\eqref=eqns:apbounds1] and [\eqref=eqns:apbounds2], f(s) is a nonvanishing analytic function for σ > 1, so the same is true for L(s). This establishes the first assertion in the lemma.

Now we consider the zeros of L(s) on σ = 1. Since [formula], the zeros or poles of L(s) on the σ  =  1 line are the zeros or poles of f(s). Taking the logarithmic derivative of [\eqref=eqn:Lfactored3] and using the same argument as above for the lower order terms, we have

[formula]

where hj(s) is bounded in [formula] for any ε > 0. By [\eqref=eqns:apbounds1] and Lemma [\ref=lem:converge], the middle term in the sum over primes in [\eqref=eqn:ld2] converges absolutely for [formula], so it was incorporated into h1(s).

Suppose [formula] are zeros or poles of L(s), with sj  =  1 + itj having multiplicity mj. We have

[formula]

therefore

[formula]

Now write

[formula]

By [\eqref=eqn:klimit2] we have

[formula]

We will manipulate [\eqref=eqn:ksum] so that so that we can use [\eqref=eqns:apbounds1] and [\eqref=eqns:apbounds2] to give a bound on [formula] in terms of M1 and M2.

By Cauchy's inequality and Lemma [\ref=lem:bound] we have

[formula]

In the last step we used the fact that the Riemann zeta function has a simple pole at 1 and no other zeros or poles on the 1-line.

Combining [\eqref=eqn:klimitL2] and [\eqref=eqn:kbound2] we have [formula] Since mj  ≥  1, the proof is complete.

Applications

Strong multiplicity one for GL(n)

Let [formula] and [formula] be cuspidal automorphic representations of the group [formula]. For a finite prime p for which πp and πp' are both unramified, let A(πp) (resp. A(πp')) represent the semisimple conjugacy class in [formula] corresponding to πp (resp. πp'). The strong multiplicity one theorem for GL(n) states that if A(πp) = A(πp') for almost all p, then π  =  π'. The following result implies, in particular, that the equality of traces tr(A(πp)) = tr(A(πp')) for almost all p is sufficient to reach the same conclusion. The traces could even be different at every prime, if those differences decreased sufficiently rapidly as a function of p.

Suppose that π and π' are (unitary) cuspidal automorphic representations of [formula] satisfying

[formula]

Assume a partial Ramanujan bound for some [formula] holds for both incomplete L-functions Lfin(s,π) and Lfin(s,π'). Then π  =  π'.

We apply Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMO] to L1(s) = Lfin(s,π) and L2(s) = Lfin(s,π'). The condition on the spectral parameters [formula] is satisfied by Proposition 2.1 of [\cite=BR]. By [\cite=BG], the partial symmetric square L-function for GL(n) has meromorphic continuation to all of [formula] and only finitely many poles in σ  ≥  1. Using the fact that the partial Rankin-Selberg L-function of a representation of GL(n) with itself has no zeros in σ  ≥  1 (see [\cite=Sh]) and that the partial exterior square L-function of GL(n) has only finitely many poles (see [\cite=Be]), we see that partial symmetric square L-function for GL(n) has only finitely many zeros in σ  ≥  1. This gives us condition [\ref=sym2nice]) of Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMO]. The conclusion of Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMO] is that L1(s) = L2(s). By the familiar strong multiplicity one theorem for GL(n), this implies π1  =  π2.

Siegel modular forms

In this section we prove Theorem [\ref=thm:m1siegelintro]. We start by giving some background on Siegel modular forms for [formula]. Let the symplectic group of similitudes of genus 2 be defined by

[formula]

Let Sp(4) be the subgroup with λ(g) = 1. The group [formula] acts on the Siegel upper half space [formula] by

[formula]

Let us define the slash operator |k for a positive integer k acting on holomorphic functions F on H2 by

[formula]

The slash operator is defined in such a way that the center of [formula] acts trivially. Let S(2)k be the space of holomorphic Siegel cusp forms of weight k, genus 2 with respect to [formula]. Then F∈S(2)k satisfies F|kγ  =  F for all γ∈Γ(2).

Let us now describe the Hecke operators acting on S(2)k. For a matrix [formula], we have a finite disjoint decomposition

[formula]

For F∈S(2)k, define

[formula]

Note that this operator agrees with the one defined in [\cite=An]. Let F∈S(2)k be a simultaneous eigenfunction for all the [formula], with corresponding eigenvalue μF(Γ(2)MΓ(2)). For any prime number p, it is known that there are three complex numbers αF0(p),αF1(p),αF2(p) such that, for any M with λ(M)  =  pr, we have

[formula]

where [formula], with

[formula]

Henceforth, if there is no confusion, we will omit the F and p in describing the αFi(p) to simplify the notations. The α0,α1,α2 are the classical Satake p-parameters of the eigenform F. It is known that they satisfy

[formula]

For any n  >  0, define the Hecke operators Tk(n) by

[formula]

Let the eigenvalues of F corresponding to Tk(n) be denoted by μF(n). Set αp = p- (k - 3 / 2)α0 and βp  =  p- (k - 3 / 2)α0α1. Then formulas for the Hecke eigenvalues μF(p) and μF(p2) in terms of αp and βp are

[formula]

The Ramanujan bound in this context is

[formula]

This is closely related to our use of that term for L-functions, as can be seen from the spin L-function of F:

[formula]

where [formula]. It satisfies the functional equation

[formula]

where ε = ( - 1)k.

Let a(p) be the pth Dirichlet coefficient of [formula]. We will use the fact that each F falls into one of two classes.

a(p) = p1 / 2 + p- 1 / 2  +  βp  +  β- 1p, where βp is the Satake p-parameter of a holomorphic cusp form on GL(2) of weight 2k - 2. In this case F is a Saito-Kurokawa lifting; for more details on Saito-Kurokawa liftings we refer to [\cite=EZ]. Note that |βp| = 1, so that a(p) = p1 / 2 + O(1) in the Saito-Kurokawa case.

a(p) = O(1). This is the Ramanujan conjecture for non-Saito-Kurokawa liftings, which has been proven in [\cite=W].

Theorem [\ref=thm:m1siegelintro] is now a consequence of the following stronger result.

Suppose Fj, for j = 1,2, are Siegel Hecke eigenforms of weight kj for [formula], with Hecke eigenvalues μj(n). If

[formula]

as X  →    ∞  , then k1 = k2 and F1 and F2 have the same eigenvalues for the Hecke operator T(n) for all n.

For i = 1,2 let ai(p) be the pth Dirichlet coefficient of [formula]. Then ai(p) = αi,p  +  α- 1i,p  +  βi,p  +  β- 1i,p, where αi,p,βi,p are the Satake p-parameters of Fi, as explained after [\eqref=trivial-central-character-condition]. By [\eqref=p-eval-form],

[formula]

Hence, condition [\eqref=eqn:m1siegel] translates into

[formula]

From the remarks made before the theorem, we see that either F1,F2 are both Saito-Kurokawa lifts, or none of them is a Saito-Kurokawa lift.

Assume first that F1,F2 are both Saito-Kurokawa lifts. Then, for i = 1,2, there exist modular forms fi of weight 2ki - 2 and with Satake parameters βi,p such that ai(p) = p1 / 2 + p- 1 / 2  +  βi,p  +  β- 1i,p. From [\eqref=eqn:m1siegelb] we obtain

[formula]

where bi,p  =  βi,p  +  β- 1i,p. Note that bi,p is the pth Dirichlet coefficient of (the analytically normalized L-function) L(s,fi). Since the Ramanujan conjecture is known for elliptic modular forms, Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMO] applies. We conclude 2k1 - 2 = 2k2 - 2 and L(s,f1) = L(s,f2). Hence k1 = k2 and [formula]. The equality of spin L-functions implies μ1(p) = μ2(p) and μ1(p2) = μ2(p2) for all p. Since T(p) and T(p2) generate the p-component of the Hecke algebra, it follows that μ1(n) = μ2(n) for all n.

Now assume that F1 and F2 are both not Saito-Kurokawa lifts. Then, using the fact that the Ramanujan conjecture is known for F1 and F2, Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMO] applies to [formula] and [formula]. We conclude that k1 = k2 and that the two spin L-functions are identical. As above, this implies μ1(n) = μ2(n) for all n.

Hyperelliptic curves

Let [formula] be an elliptic or hyperelliptic curve,

[formula]

where [formula], and let NX(p) be the number of points on X mod p. In Serre's recent book [\cite=Ser], the title of Section 6.3 is "About NX(p) - NY(p)," in which he gives a description of what can happen if NX(p) - NY(p) is bounded. For Serre, X and Y are much more general than hyperelliptic cuves, but we use the hyperelliptic curve case to illustrate an application of multiplicity one results for L-functions.

Recall that the Hasse-Weil L-function of X,

[formula]

has coefficients aX(pn) = pn + 1 - NX(pn) if p is prime, which gives the general case by multiplicativity. The L-function (conjecturally if gX  ≥  2) satisfies the functional equation

[formula]

where NX is the conductor and gX  =  ⌊( deg(f) - 1) / 2⌋ is the genus of X.

Suppose X and Y are hyperelliptic curves and NX(p) - NY(p) is bounded. If the Hasse-Weil L-functions of X and Y satisfy their conjectured functional equation [\eqref=eqn:FEhasseweil], then X and Y have the same conductor and genus, and NX(pe) = NY(pe) for all p,e.

Note that this result can be found in Serre's book without the hypothesis of functional equation. But Serre's proof involves more machinery than we use here.

To apply Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMO], we first form the analytically normalized L-function

[formula]

say. Note that we have the functional equation

[formula]

The Hasse bound for aX(n) implies the Ramanujan bound for L(s,X). The condition |NX(p) - NY(p)|  ≪  1 is equivalent to

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

by the prime number theorem. Thus, Theorem  [\ref=thm:SSMO] applies and we conclude that L(X,s) = L(Y,s).

If one knew that L(s,X) and L(s,Y) were "automorphic", then Theorem [\ref=thm:smogln] would apply, and a much weaker bound on |NX(p) - NY(p)| would allow one to conclude that NX(pe) = NY(pe) for all p,e. For example, if E,E' are elliptic curves over [formula], then [formula] for all but finitely many p implies NE(p) = NE'(p) for all p.

Selberg orthogonality and strong multiplicity one for GL(n)

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:SSMO] used only standard techniques from analytic number theory. Utilizing recent results concerning the Selberg orthonormality conjecture, and restrictng to the case of L-functions of cuspidal automorphic representations of GL(n), one obtains the following theorem, which is stronger than Theorem [\ref=eqn:apequal1].

Suppose that π, π' are (unitary) cuspidal automorphic representations of [formula], and suppose

[formula]

for some ε > 0 as X  →    ∞  . If n  ≤  4, or if Hypothesis H holds for both [formula] and [formula] (in particular if the partial Ramanujan conjecture [formula] is true for π and π'), then π  =  π'.

Using the fact that 1.42 < 2 and the consequence of the prime number theorem

[formula]

we see that condition [\eqref=eqn:smogln] holds if [formula] for all but finitely many p. Thus, the strong multiplicity one theorem only requires considering the traces of πp, and futhermore those traces can differ at every prime, and by an amount which is bounded below.

For [formula], the Ramanujan bound along with [\eqref=eqn:weakpnt] implies a version of a result of Ramakrishnan [\cite=Ram]: if [formula] for [formula] of all primes p, then π  =  π'. This result was extended by Rajan [\cite=Raj].

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:smogln] is a straightforward application of recent results toward the Selberg orthonormality conjecture [\cite=LWY] [\cite=AvSm], which make use of progress on Rudnick and Sarnak's "Hypothesis H" [\cite=RudSar] [\cite=K]. Suppose

[formula]

are L-functions, meaning that they have a functional equation and Euler product as described in Section [\ref=sec:Ldefinition].

The point of the strong multiplicity one theorem is that two L-function must either be equal, or else they must be far apart. The essential idea was elegantly described by Selberg; see [\cite=Sel]. Recall that an L-function is primitive if it cannot be written nontrivially as a product of L-functions.

Suppose that L1 and L2 are primitive L-functions with Dirichlet coefficients a(p) and b(p). Then

[formula]

where δ(L1,L2)  =  1 if L1 = L2, and 0 otherwise.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:smogln]. Rudnick and Sarnak's Hypothesis H is the assertion

[formula]

for all k  ≥  2. For a given k, this follows from a partial Ramanujan bound [formula]. Since k  ≥  2, Hypothesis H follows from the partial Ramanujan bound [formula].

For the standard L-functions of cuspidal automorphic representations on GL(n), Rudnick and Sarnak [\cite=RudSar] proved Selberg's orthonormality conjecture under the assumption of Hypothesis H, and they proved Hypothesis H for n = 2, 3. The case of n = 4 for Hypothesis H was proven by Kim [\cite=K]. Thus, under the conditions in Theorem [\ref=thm:smogln], the Selberg orthonormality conjecture is true.

Since π and π' are cuspidal automorphic representations of [formula], the L-functions [formula] and [formula] are primitive L-functions. Hence, by [\eqref=eqn:orthonormality]

[formula]

We have [formula] for some ε  >  0. This implies that ε log  log (X) is unbounded, and hence ([\ref=eqn:apbp2X]) implies that L1(s)  =  L2(s). This gives us π  =  π'.

Recently, the transfer of full level Siegel modular forms to GL(4) was obtained in [\cite=PSS]. Hence, we can apply Theorem [\ref=thm:smogln] to the transfer to GL(4) of a Siegel modular form of full level and thus obtain a stronger version of Theorem [\ref=thm:m1siegel].

Suppose Fj, for j = 1,2, are Siegel Hecke eigenforms of weight kj for [formula], with Hecke eigenvalues μj(n). If

[formula]

for some ε  >  0, as X  →    ∞  , then k1 = k2 and F1 and F2 have the same eigenvalues for the Hecke operator T(n) for all n.
