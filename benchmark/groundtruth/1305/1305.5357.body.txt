Introduction

The notion of linked partitions was introduced by Dykema [\cite=Dyke07] in the study of the unsymmetrized T-transform in free probability theory. Let [formula]. A linked partition of

[formula]

, called blocks, such that the union of [formula] is

[formula]

, list the n vertices in a horizontal line with labels [formula]. For a block [formula] with k  ≥  2 and min (B) = i1, draw an arc from i1 to ij for [formula]. For example, the linear representation of the linked partition {1,2,4}{2,3}{3,9}{5,6}{6,7}{8} is illustrated in Figure [\ref=LP].

For i < j, we use a pair (i,j) to denote an arc from i to j, and we call i and j the left-hand endpoint and the right-hand endpoint of (i,j), respectively. Two arcs (i1,j1) and (i2,j2) form a crossing if i1  <  i2  <  j1  <  j2, and form a nesting if i1  <  i2  <  j2  <  j1. For the linked partition in Figure [\ref=LP], there is one crossing formed by (1,4) and (3,9), while there are three nestings: (1,4) and (2,3), (3,9) and (5,6), (3,9) and (6,7). A linked partition is called noncrossing (resp., nonnesting) if there does not exist any crossing (resp., nesting) in its linear representation. Dykema [\cite=Dyke07] showed that the number of noncrossing linked partitions of

[formula]

also equals the number of noncrossing linked partitions of

[formula]

in increasing order from the top right corner to the bottom left corner. We use (i,j) to denote the cell in row i and column j. For example, Figure [\ref=PT] gives a permutation tableau of length 11 with an empty row.

Corteel and Nadeau [\cite=CorNad09] gave a bijection from permutation tableaux of length n with k columns and permutations of

[formula]

with k weak excedances.

The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that linked partitions play a role as an intermediate structure between permutations and permutation tableaux. More precisely, we present two bijections. The first is between linked partitions and permutations, and the second is between linked partitions and permutation tableaux. In fact, the first bijection maps a linked partition of

[formula]

with k - 1 descents, and the second bijection transforms a linked partition of

[formula]

Linked partitions and permutations

In this section, we give a bijection between linked partitions of

[formula]

with k - 1 descents.

To describe the construction of this bijection, we give a classification of the vertices in the linear representation of a linked partition. Let τ be a linked partition of

[formula]

with k blocks. Let [formula] be a permutation on

[formula]

with k descents, which is counted by the Eulerian number A(n,k + 1), see, for example, Stanley [\cite=Stanbook].

Proof. We construct a bijection φ between L(n,k) and P(n,k - 1) by a recursive procedure. Let τ∈L(n,k) be a linked partition of

[formula]

obtained by removing the vertex n along with the arcs associated to n from τ. Assume that τ' has s blocks. Let [formula] be the minimal elements of the blocks in τ'. Let [formula] be the destinations of τ'. Clearly, t = n - 1 - s. Let [formula]. We assume that the number of descents of π' is one less than the number of blocks in τ'.

We proceed to construct a permutation π by inserting n into π' such that the number of descents of π is one less than the number of blocks of τ. Let k be the minimal element in the block of τ containing n. Here are four cases.

Case 1: k = ir, where 1  ≤  r  ≤  s - 1, that is, there is an arc (ir,n) in the linear representation of τ. Set

[formula]

where [formula] is the r-th descent of π' from left to right.

Case 2: k = is. Set π  =  π' n.

Case 3: k = jr, where 1  ≤  r  ≤  t. Set

[formula]

where [formula] is the r-th ascent in π' from left to right.

Case 4: k = n, that is, n is a singleton in τ. Set π = n π'.

In any of the above cases, it can be shown that π is a permutation in P(n,k - 1). We shall only consider Case 1, since similar arguments apply to other cases. In Case 1, it is easy to check that τ' belongs to L(n - 1,k). Hence π' belongs to P(n - 1,k - 1). By [\eqref=eq1], we find that π has the same number of descents as π'. It follows that π belongs to P(n,k - 1).

It is straightforward to verify that the above procedure is reversible. Hence the map φ is a bijection for any n  ≥  1. This completes the proof.

For example, Figure [\ref=eg1] illustrates the linked partitions of {1,2,3} and the corresponding permutations.

Linked partitions and permutation tableaux

The objective of this section is to give a bijection between linked partitions of

[formula]

with k transients. We also show that our bijections can be used to deduce some equidistribution properties of permutation tableaux obtained by Corteel and Nadeau [\cite=CorNad09] and Steingrmsson and Williams [\cite=SteWil07].

To construct the bijection between linked partitions and permutation tableaux, we introduce the shape of a linked partition. Let τ be a linked partition of

[formula]

in increasing order from the top right corner to the bottom left corner.

Next, we wish to fill the cells of λ with topmost 1's and rightmost restricted 0's. Let i1 be the minimum origin in τ, and let j be a destination such that there exists a path [formula] from i1 to j with j being maximum in the linear representation of τ. Then, we fill the cell (i1,j) with 1. For [formula], we fill the cells [formula] with 0.

Let τ' be the linked partition of

[formula]

. We start with the leftmost column. For the column labeled with j, let (i,j) be the cell filled with a topmost 1. If there does not exist any rightmost restricted 0 in column j, then let (i,j) be an arc in the linear representation of τ. Otherwise, let [formula] be the cells filled with the rightmost restricted 0's. For [formula], let [formula] be the arc in the linear representation of τ, where i1 = i and im + 1 = j. Note that there is a unique topmost 1 in each column and a unique rightmost restricted 0 in each row. Thus, for any vertex j in τ, there is at most one arc whose right-hand endpoint is j. This implies that τ is a linked partition of

[formula]

. Then the number of arcs in the linear representation of τ is equal to the total number of topmost 1's and rightmost restricted 0's in T = φ(τ).

To conclude this section, we remark that our bijections φ and φ can be used to deduce some results on permutation tableaux obtained by Corteel and Nadeau [\cite=CorNad09] and Steingrmsson and Williams [\cite=SteWil07]. Corteel and Nadeau [\cite=CorNad09] showed that the number of permutation tableaux of length n with k columns is equal to the number of permutations of

[formula]

with n - k descents, we see that the number of permutation tableaux of length n with k rows is equal to the number of permutations with n - k descents, which is equivalent to the result of Corteel and Nadeau [\cite=CorNad09].

On the other hand, the number of permutations of

[formula]

with k weak excedances, see, for example, Stanley [\cite=Stanbook]. This leads to the fact that the number of permutation tableaux of length n with k rows is equal to the number of permutations of

[formula]

Pattern avoiding permutation tableaux

In this section, we discuss restrictions of the bijection φ in Section [\ref=section3] to noncrossing linked partitions and nonnesting linked partitions, and characterize the corresponding permutation tableaux by pattern avoidance.

We introduce two patterns I2 and J2 as given in Figure [\ref=pattern], where a dot means a topmost 1 or a rightmost restricted 0. We use I2 and J2 to denote these two patterns because similar notation has been used in the context of fillings of Ferrers diagrams, see de Mier [\cite=DeM07].

More precisely, let T be a permutation tableau of length n, and let T' be the permutation tableau obtained from T by replacing the topmost 1's and rightmost restricted 0's by dots and removing all other 1's and 0's. We say that T avoids the pattern I2 if T' does not contain four cells (i1,j1), (i1,j2), (i2,j1) and (i2,j2), where i1 < i2 < j1 < j2, such that the cells (i1,j2) and (i2,j1) are filled with dots, while the cell (i2,j2) is empty. Similarly, we say that T avoids the pattern J2 if T' does not contain four cells (i1,j1), (i1,j2), (i2,j1) and (i2,j2), where i1 < i2 < j1 < j2, such that the cells (i1,j1) and (i2,j2) are filled with dots, while the cell (i2,j1) is empty. For example, Figure [\ref=POA] illustrates a permutation tableau avoiding the pattern I2. Note that this permutation tableau does not avoid the pattern J2, because the cells (1,3), (1,6), (2,3) and (2,6) form pattern J2.

By the construction of the bijection φ in Section [\ref=section3], we obtain characterizations of permutation tableaux corresponding to noncrossing linked partitions and nonnesting linked partitions. To be more specific, we have the following correspondences.

Since the number of noncrossing linked partitions of

[formula]

, see Chen, Wu and Yan [\cite=CWY08], one sees that the number of J2-avoiding permutation tableaux of length n equals the number of I2-avoiding permutation tableaux of length n.
