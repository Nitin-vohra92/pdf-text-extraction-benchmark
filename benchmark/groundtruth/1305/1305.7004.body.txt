Faltings' local-global principle for the finiteness of local cohomology modules

Introduction

Throughout this paper, let R denote a commutative Noetherian ring (with identity) and [formula] an ideal of R. For an R-module M, the ith local cohomology module of M with support in [formula] is defined as:

[formula]

We refer the reader to [\cite=BS] or [\cite=Gr1] for more details about local cohomology. An important theorem in local cohomology is Faltings' Local-global Principle for the Finiteness Dimension of local cohomology modules [\cite=Fa1], which states that for a positive integer r, the [formula]-module [formula] is finitely generated for all i  ≤  r and for all [formula] if and only if the R-module [formula] is finitely generated for all i  ≤  r.

Another formulation of Faltings' Local-global Principle, particularly relevant for this paper, is in terms of the generalization of the finiteness dimension [formula] of M relative to [formula], where

[formula]

with the usual convention that the infimum of the empty set of integers is interpreted as ∞  . It is well known that [formula], see [\cite=BS]. Using this idea, for any non-negative integer n, K. Bahmanpour et al., in [\cite=BNS1], introduced the notion of the n-th finiteness dimension [formula] of M relative to [formula] by

[formula]

Note that [formula] is either a positive integer or ∞   and that [formula]. Also, they showed that the least integer i such that [formula] is not minimax (resp. weakly Laskerian), equals to [formula] (resp. [formula]). So it is rather natural to ask whether Faltings' Local-global Principle, as stated in (†), generalizes in the obvious way to the invariants [formula]. To this end, we are able to introduce the concept of an R-module in dimension <  n as a generalization of the notion of a FSF module [\cite=Qu]. An R-module M is said to be in dimension <  n, if there is a finitely generated submodule N of M such that [formula].

As a main result of this paper we shall show that:

Let [formula] be a complete local ring, [formula] an ideal of R and M a finitely generated R-module. Then for any [formula],

[formula]

As a consequence of Theorem 1.2, we derive the following, which is a generalization of the main result of Quy [\cite=Qu] and Brodmann-Lashgari [\cite=BL].

Let [formula] be a complete local ring, [formula] an ideal of R and M a finitely generated R-module. Then the set

[formula]

is finite.

Throughout this paper, R will always be a commutative Noetherian ring with non-zero identity and [formula] will be an ideal of R. By a skinny or weakly Laskerian module, we mean an R-module M such that the set [formula] is finite, for each submodule N of M (cf. [\cite=Ro] or [\cite=DM1]). Moreover, an R-module M is said to be minimax, if there exists a finitely generated submodule N of M, such that M / N is Artinian.

The Main Results

In [\cite=Qu], P. H. Quy introduced the class of FSF modules and he has given some properties and applications of this modules. An R-module M is said to be a FSF module if there is a finitely generated submodule N of M such that support of the quotient module M / N is finite. When R is a Noetherian ring, it is clear that, if M is FSF, then [formula]. This motivates the definition.

Let n be a non-negative integer. An R-module M is said to be in dimension <  n, if there is a finitely generated submodule N of M such that [formula]

Let n be a non-negative integer and let M be an R-module.

(i) If n = 0, then M is in dimension <  n if and only if M is Noetherian.

(ii) If M is minimax, then M is in dimension <  1. In particular, if M is Noetherian or Artinian, then M is in dimension <  1.

(iii) If M is FSF, then M is in dimension <  2.

(iv) If M is skinny or weakly Laskerian, then M is in dimension <  2, by [\cite=Ba].

(v) If M is reflexive, then M is in dimension < 1.

(vi) If M is linearly compact, then M is in dimension < 1. Recall that M is said to be linearly compact if each system of congruences [formula] indexed by a set I, and where the Mi are submodules of M, has a solution x whenever it has a solution for every finite subsystem. It is know that it either M reflexive or linearly compact, then M is minimax (see e.g. [\cite=DM1]).

If T is a subset of [formula] and [formula], then we define

[formula]

Let n be a non-negative integer, [formula] an ideal of R and M an R-module. Then we define

[formula]

Now we are prepared to state and prove the main result of this paper, which shows that the least integer i such that [formula] is not in dimension < n, equals to [formula]

Let [formula] be a complete local ring, [formula] an ideal of R and M a finitely generated R-module. Then for any [formula],

[formula]

Let i be a non-negative integer such that [formula] is in dimension <  n. Then it follows from the definition that there is a finitely generated submodule N of [formula] such that [formula]. Thus for all [formula] with [formula] we have [formula]. Therefore [formula] is finitely generated and so [formula].

We now suppose that [formula], and look for a contradiction. To this end, first we show that for all [formula], the set [formula] is finite. To achieve this, suppose the contrary is true. Then there exists a countably infinite subset [formula] of [formula]. Let S be the multiplicatively closed subset [formula]. We now show that the S- 1R-module [formula] is finitely generated. To do this, in view of Faltings' Local-global Principle theorem (see [\cite=BS]), it is enough to show that for all j  ≤  t and for all prime ideals [formula] with [formula], the [formula]-module [formula] is finitely generated. Since [formula], it follows that [formula], and so by [\cite=MV] there exists [formula] such that [formula]. Thus [formula]. Now, as [formula], it follows that [formula] is finitely generated, as required. Therefore the set [formula] is finite. On the other hand, we have [formula] for all [formula], which is a contradiction.

Consequently, for all [formula], the set [formula] is finite. Now, we let [formula] be the set of all prime ideals [formula] of R such that there exists [formula] with [formula]. Then [formula] is a countably infinite set. Let S be the multiplicatively closed subset [formula]. Then it is easy to see that for all [formula], the set [formula] is finite. Thus for all [formula], the set [formula] is a closed subset of [formula] (in the Zariski topology), and so the descending chain

[formula]

is eventually stationary. Let Em denote its eventually stationary value, so that there is [formula] such that for all l  ≥  m,

[formula]

Since for all i < t, [formula] is in dimension < n, it follows that [formula] is also in dimension < n. Thus there is a finitely generated submodule N of [formula] such that [formula].

Now, we show that [formula]. Suppose the contrary is true. Then there exists [formula] such that [formula]. Whence [formula], and so [formula]. Thus [formula]. On the other hand, since [formula] and [formula], it yields that [formula] is a finitely generated [formula]-module. Therefore there exists l  ≥  m such that [formula], and so [formula]. Hence we have [formula], and so [formula], which is a contradiction. Consequently, we have [formula]. Finally, from the exact sequence

[formula]

we conclude that [formula]. That is the R-module [formula] is in dimension <  n, and so we have obtained a contradiction.

Let [formula] be a complete local ring, [formula] an ideal of R and M a finitely generated R-module. Then

(i) [formula]

(ii) [formula]

The result follows from the definition and Theorem 2.5.

Let [formula] be a complete local ring, [formula] an ideal of R and M a finitely generated R-module. Then the set [formula] is finite, where [formula].

In view of Theorem 2.5, the R-module [formula] is in dimension < n. So there is a finitely generated submodule N of [formula] such that [formula]. Now the assertion follows immediately from the exact sequence

[formula]

The final result is a generalization of the main result of Quy [\cite=Qu] and Brodmann-Lashgari [\cite=BL] for complete local rings.

Let [formula] be a complete local ring, [formula] an ideal of R and M a finitely generated R-module. Then the set [formula] is finite, where [formula].

Using Corollary 2.7 it is enough to show that the set [formula] is finite. To this end, suppose that the contrary is true. Then there exists a countably infinite subset [formula] of [formula], and so by [\cite=MV], [formula], for every [formula] with [formula]. Let S be the multiplicatively closed subset [formula]. Then, it easily follows from [\cite=BS] that [formula] is a finitely generated S- 1R-module, for all [formula] and so in view of [\cite=BN], the R-module

[formula]

is finitely generated. Therefore the set

[formula]

is finite. But [formula] for all [formula] which is a contradiction.
