Introduction

Let p be an odd prime number. Throughout this paper, [formula], [formula] and [formula] will denote the ring of p-adic integers, the field of p-adic rational numbers, and the completion of the algebraic closure of [formula]. The p-adic norm [formula] is normalized as [formula]. Let f be a continuous function on [formula]. Then the fermionic p-adic integral of f on [formula] is defined by Kim
