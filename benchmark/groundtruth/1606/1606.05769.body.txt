Velocity Variations in the Phoenix-Hermus Star Stream

INTRODUCTION

The Milky Way's dark matter halo has long been known to contain dark matter sub-halos around dwarf galaxies [\citep=Aaronson:83] [\citep=FaberLin:83]. The numbers of the most massive dwarf galaxies are comparable to the predictions of LCDM galactic halos [\citep=Moore:99] [\citep=Klypin:99], but are increasingly below the predictions as their mass (or a reference velocity) declines. The "missing" dark matter sub-halos could either be present, but with a sufficiently low gas or star content that they have no detectable emission, or, the dwarf galaxy proxy of the sub-halo census is complete, indicating either the sub-halos were formed and subsequently destroyed by astrophysical processes, or, the cosmological model is incorrect on small scales so that large numbers of low mass dark halos never formed or survived the merger into larger galactic halos. At very high redshifts measurements of the UV luminosity function find that the slope of the luminosity function steepens to values much close to what LCDM predicts [\citep=Schenker:13] [\citep=Bouwens:15]. Although the high redshift observations do not directly probe the lower mass dark halos that are apparently missing at low redshift, the much steeper luminosity function is at least suggestive that many lower mass dark matter halos were present at earlier times, suggesting that they still may be there, but contain too little visible material to be readily detected.

The inner 30 kpc of a dark halo, where currently known star streams orbit, is fairly hostile to dark matter sub-halos, simply because of the relatively strong tidal field. Consequently, the fraction of the mass in sub-halos declines from 5% at the virial radius, to about 1% at 30 kpc and 0.1% at 8 kpc [\citep=Aquarius]. Although strong lensing is an attractive technique that directly "illuminates" the instantaneous position and size of those sub-halos that are near the critical line of a strong lensing system [\citep=Vegetti:14] [\citep=Dye:15] [\citep=Hezaveh:16], the critical line is generally at a fairly small galactic radius. For instance, in the strong lens system SDP.81 the critical line is at a projected radial distance of 7.7 kpc where the sub-halo population is small and has a large fractional variance [\citep=Ishiyama:09] [\citep=Chen:11] for a dark matter potential alone. In addition, inside of 8 kpc the presence of dense gas and the stellar structure of a galaxy will act to further erode sub-halos and add variance to their numbers [\citep=Donghia:10]. On the other hand, thin stellar streams are currently known in the region between about 15 and 30 kpc, where local gas and stars are not a significant part of the gravitational field.

Streams have both the drawback and advantage that they integrate the encounters of sub-halos over their last few orbits, and do not give an instantaneous snapshot of where any particular dark halo is to be found. When a sub-halo encounters a stream the stars in the streams have their velocities changed immediately, but it takes about an orbit for those velocities to open up a gap in the stream [\citep=Carlberg:12] [\citep=Erkal:15] [\citep=Sanders:16]. Such gaps are blurred out with time as the differential orbits of the stars blurs out the gap to effective invisibility in configuration space, although the changes in the orbital energy and angular momentum (or generalized versions of those quantities for triaxial potentials) remain, with the blurring being faster for relatively more eccentric orbits.

The main purpose of this paper is to provide quantitative estimates of what can be expected as velocity data are acquired for the Phoenix-Hermus stream. Besides improving the knowledge of the orbit and securing the connection with the Phoenix part of the stream, kinematic data will be able to clarify the existence, or not, of sub-halo induced gaps in the stream.

The Phoenix-Hermus Stream

[\citet=GrillmairCarlberg:16] proposed that the Hermus stream [\citep=Grillmair:14] and the Phoenix stream [\citep=Balbinot:16] [\citep=Sesar:15] are quite plausibly parts of a single long stream. Although other associations for the Phoenix stream segment have been suggested [\citep=Li:16] the attraction of the Phoenix-Hermus association is that it is a single simple system which fairly accurately combines two completely independent sets of sky position and velocity data. The derived orbital eccentricity of e≃0.05 means that there is relatively low angular momentum spread amongst the stars pulled from the cluster into the stream, hence the differential velocities across the stream, is relatively low so that the evidence of sub-halo encounters will persist for many more orbits than in a high eccentricity stream [\citep=Carlberg:15a] making Phoenix-Hermus a relatively attractive target for follow-up. At a galactocentric distance of 20 kpc and an inclination of 60 the orbit does not encounter any significant molecular clouds.

The northern section of the stream is the most readily visible with the density declining towards the south. The stream density measured in the northern piece of the Hermus stream as identified in the map of [\citet=Grillmair:14] is shown in Figure [\ref=fig_denfit]. The reduced confidence for the southern piece of Hermus is discussed in [\citet=Grillmair:14] and we do not include it in our measurement. The density error at each point in the 2 binning of Figure [\ref=fig_denfit] is 0.46 units as estimated from the local background variations. A linear fit to these data finds a density as a function of angular distance to be [formula] where φ is measured in degrees and the density scale is arbitrary. The decline from the largest value at the beginning of the stream (at η= 36.05, λ= 40.85) to zero occurs over 20, or 0.36 radians. Neither Pal 5 nor GD-1 have a significant mean density decline along their length [\citep=Carlberg:12] [\citep=Carlberg:13], so the finding that Hermus has a density decline along the stream, significant at the 3.3σ level, is somewhat novel in this small group of three well-studied, thin streams. Once the slope is removed there is no remaining excess variance in the stream density, although the noise levels are very high. The decline in the density could either be the result of the expected changes of density along the orbit, or, could be a sub-halo induced gap, which we will explore briefly within our simulations. The photometric data will improve as additional imaging comes available and GAIA astrometry will be able to identify brighter members of the stream. However, the key to really understand stream density variations is to obtain velocities, for which we explore the expectations in the remainder of this paper.

Phoenix-Hermus Stream Simulations

A set of n-body simulations to create streams similar to Phoenix-Hermus are done using the techniques described in [\citet=Carlberg:16]. The model places a King model globular cluster in the the Bovy MW2014 potential [\citep=Bovy:15] at a location of x = 10 kpc, y = 0, and z= 17.32 kpc, equivalent to a galactocentric radius of 19.5 kpc and an inclination of 60. No progenitor globular cluster has been identified so the angular phase of the stream is essentially unconstrained although this makes little difference to the stream on a nearly circular orbit. The cluster is started with a purely tangential velocity (in the y direction) of 178  which gives rise to an orbit with an eccentricity close to the inferred value of 0.05. The King model cluster is given a mass of [formula] which is about the lowest mass cluster that will give tidal streams extended enough in angle, which scales as M1 / 3, to provide substantial stream densities in opposite directions on the sky. The cluster starts with an outer radius of 0.112 kpc which is 1.9 times the nominal tidal radius estimated from the local gravitational acceleration. Over-filling the tidal radius is required to give a fractional mass loss of just 11% over an orbital lifetime of 10.7 Gyr. The simulation uses a shell code [\citep=Carlberg:15b] which gives the same accuracy (or better) than a full n-body code. 500,000 particles are in the initial cluster.

The velocities and densities in the star stream are shown in Figure [\ref=fig_vxyz_0]. No dark matter sub-halos are present. The density and mean velocities along the stream are measured in 1 bins, where angles are measured relative to the satellite location along a great circle defined by the instantaneous angular momentum vector of the satellite. The velocities are first measured relative to the values that the satellite would have at that location. The particles emerge from the inner and outer saddle points in the potential and stream away, offset from the motion of the satellite. Therefore we smooth the mean particle velocities with a running average over ±  20 which is subtracted from the individual particles to give the offset from the running mean. The running mean gets into trouble at the ends of the stream leading to erroneous offsets. Using a smaller window to compute the running mean reduces the end problems, but also artificially suppresses the velocities offsets that sub-halos create. Because the orbit is nearly circular the rate of mass loss is nearly constant, with the subsequent motion being nearly a perfect example of the dynamics [\citet=Kupper:08] described. There are significant density variations for about four cycles away from the progenitor in both directions, but the differential velocities in the stream gradually causes them to be overlapped when seen from the inner galaxy.

The Effects of Sub-halos

Sub-halos are added to the potential following the prescription of [\citet=Carlberg:16]. Only the inner 100 kpc of the simulationi s populated with sub-halos, with the inner 56 kpc fully white conference galaxy canberra, since there is no value in following sub-halos that will never cross the path of the stream. Sub-halos are generated in the mass range 2.7  ×  108 (above which mass sub-halos are very rare) to 2.7  ×  105 (at which mass sub-halos are no longer doing anything significant to a stream). The outcome is a total of about 100 sub-halos in a simulation matched to the Aquarius [\citep=Aquarius] sub-halo distribution. The numbers of sub-halos range from 57 to 168 for the different realizations from the same distribution. We generate sub-halos with the constraint that the total mass is the expected mass in the selected part of the mass spectrum. [\citet=Ishiyama:09] find that the fractional variation from one halo to another is about 25% and [\citet=Chen:11] finds that inside about a tenth of the virial radius the variation from halo to halo is about a factor of 2, up and down relative to the mean. We report simulations with the expected mean number. If there were twice as many sub-halos the number of significantly disturbed regions of the stream would exactly double. We run 40 realizations of the stream.

Figure [\ref=fig_xyz] shows one of the streams projected onto galactic cartesian coordinates at the final step of the simulation. Because the orbit is nearly circular sthe stream relative to the progenitor cluster does not depend much on the orbital phase of the cluster, but this moment is not a good match to the present time since the progenitor cluster would be readily visible in the northern sky. This stream has had an encounter with a massive sub-halo a few orbits earlier near the end of the trailing stream (the progenitor is rotating counter-clockwise) which appears as a folded section of stream and a thin trailing segment.

Figure [\ref=fig_tp] shows the projection of five separate realizations of the stream projected onto the sky. The angles are measured with respect to the instantaneous orbital plane as defined by the total angular momentum vector (which is not a conserved quantity) centered on the location of the progenitor cluster. The plots are offset from one another 0.35 radian. The vertical displacements from the orbital plane are multiplied by 5 to increase the visible width of the streams. Near the progenitor the stream particles are young and the epicyclic oscillations of tidal loss dominate. Further down the stream differential orbital velocities across the stream has blurred out the epicyclic features and the streams are old enough that they have suffered a few encounters with sub-halos. The streams vary in width along their length, although this is hard to detect in the presence of substantial foreground. Each simulation has at least one readily visible "gap" in its longitudinal density.

Figure [\ref=fig_nstream] shows the distribution of sub-halo stream encounters at distances from 1 to 3 times the scale radius of the sub-halo, the latter being a somewhat generous distance to produce a significant gap [\citep=Carlberg:12]. The procedure finds the sub-halos closest to a stream particle, relative to its scale radius, at each step. That means that when a massive sub-halo is close to the stream lower mass sub-halos are usually not counted. There are 4 mass bins per decade of mass. The most massive sub-halos will typically have one stream hit in the last 3 Gyr during which time the gaps fully develop and remain readily visible.

Sub-halos and Stream velocity perturbations

Figure [\ref=fig_vxyz_sub] shows the same quantities as Figure [\ref=fig_vxyz_0] but for a simulation with the expected number of sub-halos. Comparing the two shows the effects of the sub-halos on the stream are readily visible toward the ends of the stream. One of the main goals of this paper is to relate density variations to velocity variations along the stream. If we had access to high precision velocities for many individual stars in the stream the presence (or not) of sub-halos would be extremely obvious. The mean velocities show much smaller effects, with offsets of about 1  around the locations of the large gaps. Small gaps simply do not show up as very visible, a consequence of sky overlap of gapped and non-gapped stream regions, and the ease with which differential orbital motion blurs out small gaps.

Figure [\ref=fig_vxyz] shows ten different realizations of the same standard sub-halo population to illustrate the range of mean velocity offsets for different situations. In general if there is something that looks like a density gap, with excess density on either side, there is a good chance that there will be velocity offsets associated with it. However, there are exceptions from time to time. This means that a single stream may provide strong evidence of sub-halo encounter, but it will be important to have velocity measurements for as many streams as possible, to allow for case to case differences.

Recalling that the density measurements along the Hermus section of the stream found a fit with a density decline to zero over 0.36 radian. Such a steep decline is not seen in the no sub-halo simulation, Figure [\ref=fig_vxyz_0]. The ends of the stream have the steepest density decline, but the ends are very artificial, being the result of instantaneously inserting a progenitor star cluster into a Milky Way orbit, rather than some more gradual introduction through, say, a merger process. On the other hand, density declines as steep as measured and more are frequently obtained in simulations with sub-halos, see Figure [\ref=fig_vxyz_sub].

Figure [\ref=fig_vxyz_04] uses precisely the same measurements as Figure [\ref=fig_vxyz_sub] but adds 4% distance errors, corresponding to a parallax error of 2 micro-arcsec at a distance of 20 kpc. The radial velocities (middle, in red) are not affected at all, as expected. The velocities along the orbit have large random errors because the uncertainty in the distance means that the mean motion in the stream has errors comparable to the intrinsic motions in the stream. The vertical velocities have only a small mean motion component so the distance errors do not affect them much. Most significantly, the mean velocities are essentially unchanged, as expected if the velocity errors are uncorrelated, random, and there are sufficient numbers of stars to reduce the added noise in the mean.

Discussion

The Phoenix-Hermus stream, whether it is a single object or not, is a good case to consider for sub-halo interactions because the two visible stream segments are long, thin, and appear to be on a relatively circular orbit allowing dark matter sub-halo induced density variations, and associated velocity variations, to remain visible for many orbits before differential orbital motions blur them out. The main point established here is that we expect about one density variation per entire stream to have a region of about 10 size where there will be mean velocity offsets of 1-2 . Smaller deviations are present but would require many high precision velocities and dynamical modelling to interpret. The velocity deviation profiles along the stream do not have any simple universal shape and although associated with a density variation, the precise location along the stream relative to a density gap varies fairly uniformly from one edge to the other over the typical 10 range.

For the expected mean numbers of the power-law sub-halo population there is only one easily visible gap present at a time and that gap is the outcome of an encounter of the stream with one of the larger sub-halos, [formula]. Lower mass sub-halos, those below about [formula], generally create gaps and velocity changes that are too small to persist. With only one arm of a stream typically visible, it is possible that no detectable sub-halo effects will be found. However, in the inner halo there is a substantial range for the predicted sub-halo abundance. With the LMC approaching for the first time [\citep=Besla:07] it is possible that its collection of outer sub-halos is currently substantially boosting the numbers of sub-halos in the Milky Way as they stream through on the first infall. For Phoenix-Hermus the ideal is to have a velocity survey everywhere along the stream, but the best locations for finding velocity changes are usually where the density is changing significantly.

Radial velocities are the most robust observables, having no dependence on distance errors. Acquiring large numbers will require some patience, since even with the highly optimized color-magnitude diagram filtering techniques the chances that a given star on the sky at a representative depth around g = 21 magnitude is a stream star, as opposed to a foreground star, is generally in the 10-40% range, depending on the local over-density of the stream. The overdensity depends on the depth of the data, with the foreground and background rising quickly with increasing depth, and the stream stars having the fairly flat luminosity function typical of a globular cluster, with the exception of the rapid rise around the turnoff. The bulk of the stars are currently below the brightness levels where large scale astrometric data will be available. Nevertheless, stream stars make attractive targets for highly multiplexed spectrographs because velocities at the few tenths of a   precision will, in the mean, be able to conclusively identify features associated with encounters with sub-halos.
