Study of young stellar objects around SNR G18.8+0.3

Introduction

The interaction between the supernova remnant (SNR) G18.8+0.3 and a molecular cloud was analyzed in recent works. The molecular gas belonging to regions 1 and 2 (see Figure [\ref=figintro]) was studied in [\citet=paron2012] and [\citet=paron2015], respectively. The presence of abundant molecular gas, several embedded HII regions and the SNR, makes this region an interesting scenario to study possible triggered star formation. Thus, in this work we present a study of the distribution of the young stellar objects (YSOs) in the SNR surroundings. In addition, we study the molecular gas towards the named region 3 in Figure [\ref=figintro], which is related to the HII region G018.584+00.344.

Results

Young stellar objects

We search for YSO candidates towards a region of about 5[formula] in size around the SNR G18.8+0.3. Using the GLIMPSE Point-Source Catalog acquired by Spitzer-IRAC (at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8 μm) we selected sources following the criteria presented in [\citet=gutermuth2009]. We found 9 Class I objects and 47 Class II objects, white and magenta crosses in Figure [\ref=estrellas_jovenes], respectively, which are displayed over a three-colour image with the radio continuum emission at 20 cm presented in blue, the submillimeter continuum emission at 870 μm in green, and the 8 μm emission in red. It can be appreciated that some YSO candidates are related to cold dust condensations mapped by the submillimeter continuum. Thirty of these objects have their fluxes measured at 24 μm with MIPS-Spitzer, and thus for these sources we performed an analysis of its spectral energy distribution (SED) using the tool developed by [\citet=robitaille2007] and available online

To build the SEDs models we used the Spitzer-IRAC fluxes measured in the bands 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0 μm and the flux at 24 μm measured with Spitzer-MIPS. Using the criteria presented in [\citet=robitaille2006], the YSO candidates can be classified in:

Stage 0-I: objects with significant infalling envelopes and possibly disks. This stage is defined by [formula], where [formula] is the envelope accretion rate, and [formula] is the central source mass.

Stage II: objects with optically thick disks (and possible remains of a tenuous infalling envelope). This stage is defined by [formula] and [formula], where Mdisk is the disk mass.

Stage III: objects with optically thin disks. This stage is defined by [formula] and [formula].

Table [\ref=tablaSED] presents some stellar parameters obtained from the SED of each source. The parameters from the best fit model and their ranges obtained from all the satisfying models are presented. To do this, we selected the models that satisfied the condition [formula], where [formula] is the minimum value of the χ2 among all models, and N is the number of input data fluxes. Additionally the source stage is included in the last column of the table.

Taking into account our photometric and SED analysis of the sources and their spacial distribution towards the SNR and the associated molecular cloud, we conclude that there is no evidence that allow us to infer triggered star formation in the region. Additionally, performing a SED to the embedded HII regions (see [\citet=paron2012] [\citet=paron2015]), it is concluded that they are located at the same distance as the SNR (about 8 kpc). With this in mind, and assuming that many of the sources analyzed here are at the same distance, we conclude that we are studying a region populated by many massive stars in different evolutive stages.

Molecular gas analysis towards the HII region G018.584+00.344

Using molecular data obtained with the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) (see [\citet=paron2015] for a description of the observations), we investigated the interstellar medium around the HII region G018.584+00.344 which lies southwards the SNR G18.8+0.3 (region 3 in Fig.[\ref=figintro]). Figure [\ref=region3] is a three-colour image where the radio continuum emission at 20 cm is presented in blue, the 8 μm emission in red, and the integrated 12CO J=3-2 emission obtained with ASTE in green. The molecular peak, located estwards the HII region G018.584+00.344, coincides with an ATLASGAL submillimeter continuum source, showing an excellent correlation between the molecular gas and cold dust.

From the molecular feature defined by the 50 K km s- 1 contour in Fig.[\ref=region3] we estimated the molecular mass from three independent ways: using the measured CO luminosity, from the cold dust emission, and through tha virial theorem. The results are:

[formula]

From the comparison between the obtained mass values, it is concluded that the molecular clump is gravitationally bound, and taking into account that there is not any YSO candidate embedded in it, we suggest that it is a quiescent molecular clump.
