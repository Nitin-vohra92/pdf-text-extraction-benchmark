Dynamical Yang-Baxter maps and Hopf algebroids associated with s-sets

Youichi Shibukawa

Introduction

The quantum Yang-Baxter equation [\cite=baxter72] [\cite=baxter78] [\cite=yang67] [\cite=yang68] is closely related to algebraic structures, for example, the quantum group [\cite=drinfeld] [\cite=jimbo], the Hopf algebra [\cite=abe] [\cite=montgomery] [\cite=sweedler], and the triple system [\cite=okubokamiya]. Analogously, the quantum dynamical Yang-Baxter equation [\cite=felder] [\cite=gervais], a generalization of this equation, produces Hopf algebroids [\cite=bohm2005] [\cite=bohm2004] [\cite=day] [\cite=lu] [\cite=maltsiniotis] [\cite=ravenel] [\cite=schauenburg] [\cite=xu]. In fact, Felder's dynamical R-matrix [\cite=felder], a solution to the quantum dynamical Yang-Baxter equation, yields a Hopf algebroid called the elliptic quantum group [\cite=etingof] through the Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan construction [\cite=faddeev].

In a similar way, suitable dynamical Yang-Baxter maps [\cite=s2005] [\cite=s20101], set-theoretic solutions to a version of the quantum dynamical Yang-Baxter equation (see Remark [\ref=pre:rem:qdybe]), produce Hopf algebroids [\cite=s2016] [\cite=stakeuchi]. This Hopf algebroid implies two rigid tensor categories, one of which is a category consisting of finite-dimensional L-operators.

Our purpose is to find dynamical Yang-Baxter maps giving birth to Hopf algebroids and rigid tensor categories.

Several studies clarified how to construct the dynamical Yang-Baxter maps [\cite=matsumoto] [\cite=matsumotos] [\cite=s2005] [\cite=s2007] [\cite=s20102]. In [\cite=kamiyas], suitable homogeneous pre-systems produce the dynamical Yang-Baxter maps. The homogeneous pre-system is a generalization of the homogeneous system [\cite=kikkawa] in differential geometry, an algebraic feature of the reductive homogeneous space with suitable conditions.

It is natural to try to relate geometric structures to the construction of the dynamical Yang-Baxter map that can provide with Hopf algebroids and rigid tensor categories.

Kowalski [\cite=kowalski] presented a notion of the regular s-manifold, a generalization of the symmetric space in the sense of [\cite=loos]. The regular s-manifold is a C∞-manifold M with a differentiable multiplication M  ×  M∋(x,y)  ↦  x  ·  y∈M such that the maps sx:M∋y  ↦  x  ·  y∈M satisfy the following:

sx(x) = x for any x∈M;

every map sx is a diffeomorphism;

[formula] for any x,y∈M;

for each x∈M, the tangent map [formula] has no fixed vector except the null vector.

The aim of this paper is to construct Hopf algebroids and rigid tensor categories by introducing a notion of the s-set (Definition [\ref=tos:def:sset]), a generalization of the regular s-manifold from the algebraic point of view. In this construction, suitable s-sets give birth to the dynamical Yang-Baxter maps through the homogeneous pre-systems. This paper gives another way to relate the dynamical Yang-Baxter map to differential geometry.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we give a brief exposition of the homogeneous pre-system, the dynamical Yang-Baxter map, the Hopf algebroid, and the rigid tensor category [\cite=kamiyas] [\cite=s2016]. Section 3 discusses the construction of ternary operations by means of the s-sets. In Section 4, we apply the results of Section 3 to get the dynamical Yang-Baxter maps via the homogeneous pre-systems from suitable s-sets. The last section, Section 5, is devoted to the study of the Hopf algebroids associated with the above dynamical Yang-Baxter maps. Each Hopf algebroid can produce the rigid tensor category consisting of finite-dimensional L-operators.

Summary of homogeneous pre-systems, dynamical Yang-Baxter maps, Hopf algebroids, and rigid tensor categories

In this section, we summarize without proofs the relevant material on homogeneous pre-systems, dynamical Yang-Baxter maps, Hopf algebroids, and rigid tensor categories [\cite=kamiyas] [\cite=s2016], to render this paper as self-contained as possible.

We first introduce quasigroups [\cite=pflugfelder] [\cite=smith].

A nonempty set Q with a binary operation Q  ×  Q∋(u,v)  ↦  uv∈Q is called a quasigroup, iff:

for any u,w∈Q, there uniquely exists v∈Q such that uv = w;

for any v,w∈Q, there uniquely exists u∈Q such that uv = w.

That is to say, the left and the right translations on the quasigroup are both bijective. On account of this fact, we define the map [formula] by

[formula]

Any group is a quasigroup; on the other hand, the quasigroup is not always associative.

Let Q5: = {0,1,2,3,4}. We define a binary operation on this set Q5 by Table [\ref=pre:table:q5]. Here 0  4 = 0. Each element of Q5 appears once and only once in each row and in each column of Table [\ref=pre:table:q5], and this set Q5 is hence a quasigroup [\cite=pflugfelder]. The binary operation on Q5 is not associative, because [formula].

A pair (S,η) of a nonempty set S and a ternary operation η:S  ×  S  ×  S  →  S is called a homogeneous pre-system [\cite=kamiyas], iff the ternary operation η satisfies: for any x,y,u,v,w∈S,

[formula]

This homogeneous pre-system (S,η) satisfying

[formula]

together with a suitable quasigroup, can produce a dynamical Yang-Baxter map [\cite=kamiyas]. Let H and X be nonempty sets with a map H  ×  X∋(λ,x)  ↦  λx∈H.

A map σ(λ):X  ×  X  →  X  ×  X (λ∈H) is a dynamical Yang-Baxter map, iff σ(λ) satisfies a version of the quantum dynamical Yang-Baxter equation

[formula]

Here, the maps σ12(λX(3)),σ23(λ):X  ×  X  ×  X  →  X  ×  X  ×  X are defined by

[formula]

For a map σ(λ):X  ×  X  →  X  ×  X (λ∈H), we set R(λ)(x,y): = σ(λ)(y,x) (λ∈H,x,y∈X). Then the following conditions are equivalent:

the map σ(λ) satisfies ([\ref=pre:eq:avbr]);

the map R(λ) satisfies

[formula]

for any λ∈H [\cite=s2005].

Throughout this paper, both ([\ref=pre:eq:avbr]) and ([\ref=pre:eq:avqdybe]) are called versions of the quantum dynamical Yang-Baxter equation (see also Remark [\ref=pre:rem:brvg]).

Let (S,η) be a homogeneous pre-system satisfying ([\ref=pre:eq:hps]), and let Q be a quasigroup, isomorphic to S as sets. We denote by π:Q  →  S the (set-theoretic) bijection that gives this isomorphism. We define the ternary operation μ on S by

[formula]

The ternary operation μ satisfies:

[formula]

For λ∈Q, we define the map σ(λ):Q  ×  Q  →  Q  ×  Q by

[formula]

Here, h(λ,v,u) = π- 1(μ(π(λ),π(λv),π((λv)u))) (λ,u,v∈Q) and see ([\ref=pre:eq:backslash]) for [formula]. Proposition [\ref=pre:prop:mu] implies ([\ref=pre:eq:avbr]), and we have the following as a result.

The map σ(λ) is a dynamical Yang-Baxter map.

Furthermore, we assume that this dynamical Yang-Baxter map σ(λ) satisfies:

the set S is finite (and so is the set Q);

for any b,c,d∈S, there uniquely exists a∈S such that

[formula]

for any a,c,d∈S, there exists a unique solution b∈S to ();

for any a,b,d∈S, there exists a unique solution c∈S to ().

This dynamical Yang-Baxter map σ(λ) produces the Hopf algebroid Aσ [\cite=s2016]. We will briefly describe it as below.

Let [formula] be an arbitrary field, and let MQ denote the [formula]-algebra of all [formula]-valued maps on the set Q. We define a map Ta:MQ  →  MQ (a∈Q) by

[formula]

Let Lab,(L- 1)ab (a,b∈Q) be indeterminates. We define the set AQ by

[formula]

Aσ is the quotient of the free [formula]-algebra [formula] on the set AQ by two-sided ideal Iσ whose generators are:

ξ  +  ξ' - (ξ  +  ξ'), cξ - (cξ), ξξ' - (ξξ') [formula].

Here the symbol +   in ξ  +  ξ' means the addition in the algebra [formula], while the symbol +   in (ξ  +  ξ')(∈AQ) is the addition in the algebra [formula]. The notations of the scalar products and products in the other generators are similar.

[formula], [formula] (a,b∈Q).

Here δab denotes Kronecker's delta symbol.

[formula],

[formula],

[formula],

[formula] (f∈MQ,a,b∈Q).

Here 1MQ defined by 1MQ(λ) = 1 (λ∈Q) is the unit of MQ (for Ta, see ([\ref=pre:eq:Ta])).

[formula] (a,b,c,d∈Q).

Here σxyac∈MQ is defined by

[formula]

[formula].

This algebra Aσ is a Hopf algebroid.

For details of the Hopf algebroid including its definition, see [\cite=bohm2005] [\cite=bohm2004].

This Hopf algebroid Aσ produces the rigid tensor category [formula] consisting of finite-dimensional L-operators associated with the dynamical Yang-Baxter map σ [\cite=s2016] [\cite=stakeuchi]. For the definition of [formula], we need a tensor category VG. Here, G is the opposite group of the group of all permutations on the set Q.

An object of the category VG is a G-graded [formula]-vector space [formula]; and its morphism f:V  →  W is a map [formula] satisfying

[formula]

for any λ∈Q, where [formula] is the [formula]-vector space of [formula]-linear maps from V to W. In addition, the composition fg of morphisms f and g is defined by [formula] (λ∈Q).

VG is a tensor category. The tensor product [formula] of objects [formula] and [formula] is [formula], where [formula]. Here, γβ(∈G) is the multiplication of γ and β in the group G. In addition, the tensor product [formula] of morphisms f:U  →  V and g:W  →  Y is a map [formula] (λ∈Q). Here, [formula] is defined by

[formula]

The unit I is the [formula]-vector space [formula] with

[formula]

The left and right unit constraints with respect to this unit I are defined by [formula] and [formula] (λ∈Q). Here,

[formula]

We are now in a position to construct the rigid tensor category [formula]. For a∈Q, we define [formula] by [formula] (λ∈Q). This definition is unambiguous, because Q is a quasigroup. Let [formula] denote the [formula]-vector space with the basis Q. This [formula] is an object of VG, since [formula] and

[formula]

This is well defined on account of the definition of the quasigroup. We can regard the map σ(λ):Q  ×  Q  →  Q  ×  Q (λ∈Q) as a [formula]-linear map on [formula], and this [formula] is a morphism of the category VG.

A version of the quantum dynamical Yang-Baxter equation ([\ref=pre:eq:avbr]) for the dynamical Yang-Baxter map σ(λ) is exactly the same as the braid relation in the category VG [\cite=s2016].

The object of [formula] is a pair of an object V∈VG of finite dimensions and an isomorphism [formula] of VG satisfying

[formula]

The morphism f:(V,LV)  →  (W,LW) is a morphism f:V  →  W of VG such that [formula].

The tensor product [formula] is [formula], and the tensor product of morphisms is exactly the same as that of VG: [formula]. The unit is [formula].

From [\cite=s2016], we have the following.

[formula] is a rigid tensor category.

Ternary operations from s-sets

Let M be a non-empty set and sx:M  →  M a bijection for each x∈M. An s-set (M,{sx}x∈M) is a generalization of the regular s-manifold [\cite=kowalski] (see Introduction) in the generalized symmetric spaces from the algebraic point of view.

A pair (M,{sx}x∈M) is an s-set, iff the bijections sx satisfy

[formula]

for any x,y∈M.

For a simple example, we note that any group G makes an s-set (G,{sx}). Here, the bijection sx (x∈G) is defined by sx(y) = xyx- 1 (y∈G).

In this section, we will show that every s-set (M,{sx}) can produce ternary operations η on the set M satisfying ().

Let [formula] (l  ≥  1), and we write

[formula]

Here, wI(X,Y) is an element of the quotient of the free algebra on the set {X,X- 1,Y,Y- 1} by the two-sided ideal whose generators are XX- 1 - 1,X- 1X - 1,YY- 1 - 1, and Y- 1Y - 1.

Let ηI denote the ternary operation on an s-set (M,{sx}) defined by

[formula]

The ternary operation η: = ηI satisfies ().

The proof is by induction on the length [formula] of the word wI(X,Y).

If l(wI) = 0, then wI is an empty word, and ηI(x,y,z) = wI(sx,sy)(z) = z as a result. An easy computation shows ([\ref=hps:eq:eta1]).

If l(wI) = 1, then wI(X,Y) = X,X- 1,Y,Y- 1. We give the proof only for the case that wI(X,Y) = X- 1. Because wI(X,Y) = X- 1, ηI(x,y,z) = s- 1x(z). By substituting s- 1x(u) into y in ([\ref=tos:eq:symmetry]),

[formula]

and consequently, the right-hand-side of ([\ref=hps:eq:eta1]) is s- 1xs- 1u(w), which is exactly the left-hand-side of ([\ref=hps:eq:eta1]).

If l(wI)  ≥  2, then there exists a word w'(X,Y) whose length is less than l(wI) such that wI(X,Y) = Xw'(X,Y), or wI(X,Y) = X- 1w'(X,Y), or wI(X,Y) = Yw'(X,Y), or wI(X,Y) = Y- 1w'(X,Y). For example, if wI(X,Y) = X- 3Y2XY8, then we set w'(X,Y) = X- 2Y2XY8, which satisfies wI(X,Y) = X- 1w'(X,Y).

We prove only for the case that wI(X,Y) = X- 1w'(X,Y). Since wI(X,Y) = X- 1w'(X,Y), ηI(x,y,z) = s- 1xw'(sx,sy)(z), and the right-hand-side of ([\ref=hps:eq:eta1]) is

[formula]

Substituting w'(sx,sy)(u) into u in ([\ref=hps:eq:sxsu]) gives

[formula]

and, in the same manner, we can see that ss- 1xw'(sx,sy)(v) = s- 1xsw'(sx,sy)(v)sx. Now ([\ref=hps:eq:pr0]) becomes

[formula]

Let X,Y,Z,X- 1,Y- 1,Z- 1 be indeterminates satisfying

[formula]

and let w(X,Y) be a word of X, X- 1, Y, and Y- 1. Then w(ZXZ- 1,ZYZ- 1) = Zw(X,Y)Z- 1. Here, we regard w(X,Y) as an element of the quotient of the free algebra on the set {X,X- 1,Y,Y- 1, Z,Z- 1} by the two-sided ideal whose generators are XX- 1 - 1, X- 1X - 1, YY- 1 - 1, Y- 1Y - 1, ZZ- 1 - 1, and Z- 1Z - 1.

The proof of this lemma is obvious, because (ZX±  1Z- 1)i = ZX±  iZ- 1 for any [formula].

On account of this lemma, ([\ref=hps:eq:pr05]) is

[formula]

We define the ternary operation η' on M by η'(x,y,z) = w'(sx,sy)(z) (x,y,z∈M). Because of the fact that

[formula]

the induction hypothesis, and ([\ref=hps:eq:sformulas]), ([\ref=hps:eq:pr1]) is

[formula]

We will prove the following claim later.

For any x,y,u∈M,

[formula]

By virtue of this claim, the right-hand-side of ([\ref=hps:eq:pr2]) is exactly the same as the left-hand-side of ([\ref=hps:eq:eta1]), which is the desired conclusion.

The proof is similar to that of the theorem; we will prove it by induction on the length l(w') of the word w'(X,Y).

The proof of the cases that l(w') = 0,1 is obvious.

If l(w')  ≥  2, then there exists a word w''(X,Y) whose length is less than l(w') such that w'(X,Y) = Xw''(X,Y), or w'(X,Y) = X- 1w''(X,Y), or w'(X,Y) = Yw''(X,Y), or w'(X,Y) = Y- 1w''(X,Y). We prove only for the case w'(X,Y) = X- 1w''(X,Y). Since w'(X,Y) = X- 1w''(X,Y), the left-hand-side of ([\ref=hps:eq:s]) is

[formula]

By substituting w''(sx,sy)(u) into u in ([\ref=hps:eq:sxsu]), ([\ref=hps:eq:sw']) is s- 1xsw''(sx,sy)(u)w''(sx,sy). By the induction hypothesis, this is s- 1xw''(sx,sy)su = w'(sx,sy)su, which is exactly the right-hand-side of ([\ref=hps:eq:s]). This establishes the formula.

Dynamical Yang-Baxter maps from s-sets

This section is devoted to the construction of the dynamical Yang-Baxter maps (Definition [\ref=pre:def:dybm]) via the homogeneous pre-systems (Definition [\ref=pre:def:hps]) by means of suitable s-sets (Definition [\ref=tos:def:sset]).

Let R be a ring with the unit 1(  ≠  0), M a left R-module, and r an invertible element of the ring R. We define sx:M  →  M (x∈M) by

[formula]

(M,{sx}) is an s-set.

In fact, the inverse of the map sx is

[formula]

and it is a simple matter to show ([\ref=tos:eq:symmetry]).

Let [formula] (l  ≥  2). We denote by ΦI(X) the following polynomial of the variables X and X- 1.

[formula]

ηI(x,y,z) = (ΦI(r) - rd)x + (1 - ΦI(r))y + rdz for any x,y,z∈M. Here, ηI(x,y,z) is defined in () and [formula].

The proof of the proposition is by induction on l. For the proof of the l = 2 case, we need

For any integer i,

[formula]

As a corollary of this lemma,

[formula]

which immediately induces the l = 2 case. The rest of the proof is straightforward.

As a corollary, we find

If the invertible element r∈R satisfies that ΦI(r) = 0 in R, then (M,η) is a homogeneous pre-system (see Definition ) satisfying ().

The proof is obvious, since

[formula]

if ΦI(r) = 0.

Let k(  ≥  2) be a positive integer, and let [formula] be a primitive k-th root of unity. We denote by Φk the cyclotomic polynomial of level k. If k = 6, then ΦI(X): = Φ6(X) = 1 - X + X2 satisfies ([\ref=hpss:eq:phi]) (I = (1,1)). Because ΦI(r) = 0, any [formula]-vector space V produces a homogeneous pre-system satisfying () on account of Corollary [\ref=hpss:cor:hps].

If k = 10,14,15,18,20,21,22,24,26,28,33,34,35,36,38,39,40, then any primitive k-th root r of unity can also give birth to a homogeneous pre-system satisfying ().

The s-set (V,{sx}) for any finite-dimensional [formula]-vector space V in the above example is a regular s-manifold of order k (see [\cite=kowalski]). Here, we regard V as an [formula]-vector space of [formula] dimensions.

Let [formula]. The invertible element r: = 2∈R is a root of Φ(2,1)(X) = 1 - X2 + X3, and hence r with any (left) R-module M gives a homogeneous pre-system satisfying () according to Corollary [\ref=hpss:cor:hps]. In fact, η(2,1)(x,y,z) =  - 3x + y + 3z. In a similar fashion, the invertible element 3∈R also provides with such a homogeneous pre-system, because 3 is a root of Φ(2, - 1)(X) = 1 - X2 + X.

Let [formula]. The invertible element r: = 2∈R is also a root of Φ(2,1,1)(X) = Φ(2,1)(X) = 1 - X2 + X3, and hence r with any (left) R-module M gives a homogeneous pre-system satisfying () according to Corollary [\ref=hpss:cor:hps]. In this case, η(2,1,1)(x,y,z) =  - x + y + z, because rd = r4 = 1 in R. On account of ([\ref=pre:def:mu]), this η(2,1,1) yields the ternary operation μ in [\cite=s2016].

Let Q be a quasigroup (Definition [\ref=pre:def:quasigroup]), isomorphic to the set M as sets. If the element r(∈R) satisfies ΦI(r) = 0, then it follows from Proposition [\ref=pre:prop:dybm] and Corollary [\ref=hpss:cor:hps] that this s-set (M,{sx}) with the quasigroup Q gives birth to the dynamical Yang-Baxter map σ(λ) (Definition [\ref=pre:def:dybm]).

Hopf algebroids from finite s-sets and rigid tensor categories

Let R be a ring with the unit 1(  ≠  0), M a left R-module, r(∈R) an invertible element satisfying ΦI(r) = 0 (for ΦI, see ([\ref=hpss:eq:phi])), and Q a quasigroup, isomorphic to the set M as sets (see Definition [\ref=pre:def:quasigroup]).

In this last section, we will construct Hopf algebroids by means of the dynamical Yang-Baxter maps σ(λ) in Section [\ref=hpss]. In order to define the Hopf algebroid, we restrict our attention to the case that M is finite and that |M| > 1 (it follows that |Q| > 1). We remark that [formula] in Examples [\ref=hpss:example:finites-set] and [\ref=hpss:example:ordinarymu] is a field and that any (left) R-module M is an R-vector space. Hence, each M(  ≠  {0}) in Examples [\ref=hpss:example:finites-set] and [\ref=hpss:example:ordinarymu] of finite dimensions is finite and satisfies |M| > 1.

The ternary operation μ () on M satisfies:

for any b,c,d∈M, there exists a unique solution a∈M to ();

for any a,c,d∈M, there exists a unique solution b∈M to ();

for any a,b,d∈M, there exists a unique solution c∈M to ().

The proof is clear from ([\ref=hpss:eq:etaI]) and the fact that the element r is invertible in the ring R.

By virtue of Proposition [\ref=pre:prop:hopfalgebroid], we have the following.

Aσ is a Hopf algebroid.

The homogeneous pre-system η(2,1,1) in Example [\ref=hpss:example:ordinarymu] yields a Hopf algebroid Aσ in [\cite=s2016].

Furthermore, we have the following from Proposition [\ref=pre:prop:rigidtensor].

[formula] is a rigid tensor category.

In view of Proposition [\ref=hafsrtc:prop:mu] (2) (see [\cite=s2016]), [formula], and this object is not the unit of [formula], because |Q| > 1. The rigid tensor category [formula] is hence non-trivial (see [\cite=stakeuchi]).
