Irreducible p-constant characters in finite reflection groups

Introduction

Let G be a finite group and let p be a prime dividing the order of G. Denote by [formula] the set of the p-singular elements of G, i.e. the elements whose orders are divisible by p. We say that a (complex) irreducible character χ of G is p-constant if it takes constant value on [formula], i.e. there exists a constant c such that χ(g) = c for all [formula]. When χ is p-constant, we shall use the symbol cχ to denote the constant value of χ on [formula]. By [\cite=PZ], the constant cχ must be a rational integer. It is easy to see that the irreducible characters χ of p-defect zero (i.e. whose degree equals the order of a Sylow p-subgroup of G) are precisely the irreducible p-constant characters with cχ = 0: in this paper we will always consider the case cχ  ≠  0. In view of this, we can look at p-constant characters as a generalization of p-defect zero characters (a generalization to the reducible case was considered in [\cite=PZ2]).

The problem of classifying irreducible p-constant characters was firstly introduced in [\cite=PZ], where we studied finite quasi-simple groups. In particular, we obtained the following result.

[\cite=PZ] Let G be a finite simple group admitting an irreducible p-constant character χ for some prime p dividing the order of G. Then, one of the following holds:

cχ∈{0,  ±  1};

G = M22, p = 3, χ(1) = 385 and cχ =  - 2;

G is a group of Lie type of characteristic r  ≠  p with a non-cyclic Sylow p-subgroup.

In the same paper, also the p-constant characters of the symmetric groups were classified. Starting from that result, in the present paper we study the other finite reflections groups as well as other notable classes of groups as nilpotent groups, direct and wreath products of groups.

In Section [\ref=Sec2] we prove in particular that finite nilpotent groups do not admit non-linear irreducible p-constant characters of non-zero p-defect. In Section [\ref=Sec3] we completely classify the finite reflection groups admitting p-constant characters. We may empathize some of the results of this section in the following.

Let G be a finite reflection group and let χ be a non-trivial irreducible character of G. Suppose that χ is p-constant of non-zero p-defect. Then the following holds:

cχ  =    ±  1;

p = 2 if, and only if, G is a dihedral group of order 2n with n odd. In such cases, χ is linear.

The classification of p-constant characters for groups of type Bn relies on a combinatorial version of Murnaghan-Nakayama rule given in [\cite=Bn]. The same techniques used here can be also applied for studying the endotrivial modules of such groups (as done for symmetric groups in [\cite=end]). In Section [\ref=Sec4] we present some open problems and conjectures that we hope can attract the interest on this subject. For any odd prime p, we construct a Frobenius group admitting an irreducible p-constant character χ with cχ = 2. We also classify the p-constant characters of [formula] and [formula], proving that case (iii) of Theorem [\ref=simple] contains an infinite number of groups. It is worth of observe that by [\cite=LM] case (iii) only may contain groups whose Sylow p-subgroups have rank ≤  2, with the possible exceptions of [formula], [formula] and E8(q).

Notations

To avoid misunderstanding with the reflection groups, we denote the cyclic group of order n by [formula]. By [formula] and [formula] we mean, respectively, the alternating and the symmetric group of degree n. Given a finite group G and a positive integer n, Gn denotes the direct product of n copies of G. If p is a prime, |G|p denotes the order of a Sylow p-subgroup of G.

Linear characters and nilpotent groups

Let G be a finite group and let p a be a prime dividing the order of G. Clearly, the principal character 1G of G is p-constant for any prime p. More in general, for linear characters we prove the following.

Let χ be a linear character of a finite group G. Then, χ is p-constant for some prime p if, and only if, one of the following occurs:

cχ =  + 1 and [formula];

cχ =  - 1, p = 2 and [formula], where ker (χ) has odd order and x is an involution.

If χ is p-constant, then [formula] and so cχ  =    ±  1. Clearly, if cχ = 1, then [formula]. If cχ =  - 1, then p = 2 and ker (χ) has odd order. Working in H = G /  ker (χ), consider the linear character [formula] induced by χ on H. Since [formula] is a faithful linear character of H, then H is cyclic, say H = 〈x̄〉. From (x̄) =  - 1 we get x̄2∈ ker () and so |H| = 2. Hence, [formula] for some involution x.

We start our analysis with finite p-groups and nilpotent groups, recalling the following result.

[\cite=PZ] Let G be a finite group and let χ be an irreducible character of G of non-zero p-defect, for some prime p dividing the order of G. Suppose that χ is non-trivial and p-constant. Then, one of the following holds:

p does not divide |Z(G)|, Z(G)  ≤   ker (χ) and the corresponding character [formula] of G / Z(G) is an irreducible p-constant character;

p = |Z(G)| = 2, the order of ker (χ) is odd and G =  ker (χ)  ×  Z(G).

As consequence of the previous lemma we get the following.

Let p be a prime. A finite p-group G has irreducible non-trivial p-constant characters of non-zero p-defect if and only if |G| = p = 2.

Let H,K be two finite groups and let G = H  ×  K. Let [formula] be a p-constant character, for some prime p dividing the order of G, with cχ  ≠  0. If p divides both |H| and |K|, then χ = 1G. If p divides |H| but does not divide |K|, then [formula], where [formula] is p-constant on non-zero p-defect.

Suppose that p divides the order of H. Since G is a direct product of groups, [formula] for some [formula] and [formula]. Fix an element [formula]: for any k∈K, we have [formula] and χ(hk) = ψ(h)φ(k) = cχ  ≠  0. Hence, φ(k) takes the same value for all k∈K and so φ = 1K, i.e. [formula]. It follows that for any [formula] we have χ(h) = ψ(h) = cχ. Hence, ψ is p-constant and cχ = cψ  ≠  0.

Now, assume that p also divides the order of K. Proceeding as before, by symmetry we obtain that [formula].

Let H be a finite p-group and let K be a finite r-group, where p < r are two primes. If G = H  ×  K admits an irreducible p-constant character χ  ≠  1G with cχ  ≠  0, then p = |H| = 2 and χ is linear.

By Proposition [\ref=direct], [formula] for some irreducible p-constant character ψ of H. Now, since H is a p-group and χ  ≠  1G, by Corollary [\ref=p-group], we have p = |H| = 2 and ψ is the non-principal linear character of H.

A finite nilpotent group G does not admit non-linear irreducible p-constant characters of non-zero p-defect. More precisely, if χ is an irreducible p-constant character of G with cχ  ≠  0, then either χ = 1G or χ is linear and |G|2 = 2.

The result follows from the previous corollary, writing G as the direct product of its Sylow pi-subgroups.

Finite reflection groups

In this section we consider finite groups generated by reflections (in real euclidean spaces). We will refer to [\cite=H] for construction, properties and notation concerning this type of groups. We recall in particular that the finite reflection groups are precisely the finite Coxeter groups. Completely classified by Coxeter himself, they are direct products of members of four infinite families (An, Bn, Dn, I2(n)) and six 'exceptional' groups (E6, E7, E8, F4, H3, H4). Hence, by Proposition [\ref=direct] we may restrict our attention to the 'irreducible' finite reflections groups.

The p-constant characters of exceptional reflection groups can be classified using their character tables. In the following proposition, χm denotes the m-th irreducible character, according to the ordering of [\cite=GAP].

Let G be a reflection group of type E6,E7,E8,F4,H3 or H4 and let [formula] be a non-trivial character of G with non-zero p-defect. Then χ is p-constant if, and only if, one of the following occurs:

G = E6, p = 5 and (m,χm(1))∈{(5,6),(13,24),(23,64),(25,81)};

G = E7 and

(m,χm(1))∈{(9,56),(11,84),(18,189),(22,216)} or

(m,χm(1))∈{(3,15),(6,27),(15,120),(22,216),(28,405),(30,512)};

G = E8, p = 7 and (m,χm(1))∈{(9,50),(18,300),(36,972),(61,3200), (62,4096),(66, 6075)};

[formula] and

(m,χm(1))∈{(4,4),(5,5)} or

(m,χm(1)) = (4,4).

In all these cases cχ  =    ±  1.

We now consider the four infinite families An, Bn, Dn and I2(n). If G is of type An, then it is isomorphic to the symmetric group [formula]. The irreducible characters of G are then parametrized by the partitions λ of n + 1, see [\cite=JK]. From [\cite=PZ] we get the following result.

Let G be a group of type An with n  ≥  2. Let χλ be the irreducible character of G associated to the partition λ of (n + 1). Suppose that χλ is non-linear of non-zero p-defect. Then, χ is p-constant for some prime p  ≤  n + 1 if, and only if, one of the following conditions holds:

n = p - 1  ≥  2 and λ = (b,1p - b), where 2  ≤  b  ≤  p - 1;

n = p  ≥  3 and λ = (b + 1,2,1p - b - 2), where 1  ≤  b  ≤  p - 2;

n + 1 = p + r  ≥  5, 2  ≤  r  ≤  p and λ is one of the following partitions

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=linear], it is easy to see that the linear character χ(1n) of [formula] is p-constant if and only if n = p,p + 1.

Finite reflection groups of type Bn, n  ≥  2, are isomorphic to the wreath products [formula]. We then consider the more general case of wreath products [formula], where H is any finite group. The classification of the irreducible p-constant characters of [formula] (which is sometimes called the complete monomial group) shall be obtained applying the combinatorial version of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule given in [\cite=Bn]. We recall here some of the basic properties of G with respect to conjugacy classes and irreducible characters. For further details, see [\cite=Bn].

We can think G as the group of the n  ×  n monomial matrices whose entries are elements of H. In particular, if π is the k-cycle [formula] of [formula], we denote by [formula] the permutation matrix corresponding to the cycle π whose entries 1 are replaced by the elements [formula]. If [formula] are the r conjugacy classes of H, an element [formula] is said to be a Cj-cycle if [formula].

If [formula] is a partition of n, we write [formula] (or |γ| = n) and we write [formula] for the number of parts of γ. By [formula] we denote a r-uple [formula] of partitions γi such that [formula] (we use [formula] to empathize the integer n). We also allow that some of the components of [formula] can be the empty partition [formula]. Then, the set of conjugacy classes of G is given by [formula], where [formula] is the set of elements of G whose Cj-cycles have a cyclic decomposition γj, for all [formula]. Similarly, we have [formula]. In particular, the irreducible characters of G obtained by inflation from [formula] are the characters [formula], where [formula] with [formula] (so, [formula]).

The Murnaghan-Nakayama rule gives the value [formula] of the irreducible character [formula] on the conjugacy class [formula]. Following [\cite=Bn], given [formula], we denote by [formula] the skew shape formed by placing the Ferrers diagrams of [formula] corner to corner (the Ferrers diagram of a partition γ is constructed taking γ1 boxes in the first row from the top, γ2 boxes in the second one and so on). Let T be a [formula]-rim hook tableau of shape [formula] and type [formula], i.e. a rim hook tableaux of shape [formula], where the lengths of the rim hooks are found in the parts of the components of [formula]. Let ηj,i(T) be the partition formed by the lengths of the rim hooks of δj placed in the Ferrers diagram of γi in T. Set

[formula]

where ψij is the value of the i-th irreducible character of H on the class Cj (take ψ1 = 1H) and [formula] is the product of the signs of the rim hooks in T (i.e., ( - 1)t - 1 where t is the number of rows occupied by the rim hook). Then

[formula]

where the sum runs over all [formula]-rim hook tableaux of shape [formula] and type [formula].

Let H be a finite group. An irreducible character χ of [formula] of non-zero p-defect is p-constant if and only if p does not divide |H|, Hn  ≤   ker (χ) and the corresponding character [formula] of [formula] is p-constant.

Let [formula] be an irreducible p-constant character of [formula], for some prime p dividing |G|, of non-zero p-defect. We want to prove that p  ≤  n and [formula] for some [formula].

Assume first that p divides the order of H. For any conjugacy class Cj of H contained in [formula], consider the conjugacy classes [formula] of G, where [formula] is the r-uple whose only non-empty component is the partition (n) in the j-th position and [formula] is the r-uple whose only two non-empty components are the partition (n - 1) in the j-th position and the partition (1) in the k-th position (j  ≠  k). Clearly, [formula]. Since [formula] is non-zero on [formula], then [formula] has a unique non-empty component, say in position i: [formula], where [formula] must be a hook, i.e. γ = (1a,n - a) for some 0  ≤  a  ≤  n - 1. Furthermore, [formula] and so the character ψi is a p-constant character of H.

Now, suppose 1  ≤  a  ≤  n - 2. Then

[formula]

a contradiction. If γ = (1n), then [formula] implies ψi1 =  - 1 is the degree of ψi, an absurd. So, γ = (n). We get [formula] and so ψi is linear. Now, [formula] implies ψik = 1 for all k  ≠  j. It follows that either ψi = 1H (and so χ = 1G) or p = 2 and [formula].

Thus, we may now assume p  ≤  n. Our next goal is to prove that [formula] has a unique non-empty component. The choice of the conjugacy classes [formula] defined below is functional also for proving Proposition [\ref=pr:Dn]. Assume that [formula] has at least two non-empty components and write n = pk + t with 0  ≤  t < p. If t = 0, take [formula]. Then [formula], but [formula], a contradiction. It t > 0, take the classes of p-singular elements of G corresponding to the following r-uples:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

From [formula] it follows that [formula] has at most two non-empty components. Then [formula] has exactly two non-empty components, say in position i and j, that must be hooks of length, respectively, pk and t. For any [formula] we have

[formula]

for some ε  =    ±  1, and so ψi = 1H (i.e. i = 1). Now,

[formula]

for all [formula] also implies ψj = 1H and j = 1, a contradiction.

We conclude that [formula] has at exactly only one non-empty component, [formula] in the i-th position. We prove now that actually i = 1. For all [formula] we have

[formula]

for some ν∈{  ±  1,  ±  2}, which implies ψi = 1H and so [formula] for some partition γ of n.

As observed before, in this case Hn  ≤   ker (χ) and the corresponding character [formula] must be a p-constant character of [formula]. Hence, if p divides |H|, then p = 2 and so [formula] is a 2-constant character of [formula]: this happens only when n = 2,3 and [formula] is linear. However, [formula] is a 2-group and by Lemma [\ref=p-group], χ = 1G. Also [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] and by Proposition [\ref=direct], we get χ = 1G.

Let G be a group of type Bn with n  ≥  2. Let χ be an irreducible character of G of non-zero p-defect. Then, χ is p-constant for some prime p  ≤  n if and only if p > 2, [formula] and the corresponding character [formula] of [formula] is p-constant.

The groups Dn are subgroups of index 2 in Bn. Let α,β be partitions of some 0  ≤  t  ≤  n such that |α| + |β| = n and let χ(α,β) be the corresponding irreducible character of [formula]. If α  ≠  β, the characters χ(α,β) and χ(β,α) restrict to the same irreducible character of G = Dn. The character χ(α,α) splits on G as the sum of two irreducible characters χ(α,α)+,χ(α,α)- of G. Furthermore, a class C(α,β) of H belongs to G only if β has even length and a class C(α,β) of H splits into two classes of G if and only if [formula] and the parts of α are all even (see [\cite=Pf]).

Let G be a group of type Dn with n  ≥  4. Let χ be an irreducible character of G of non-zero p-defect. Then, χ is p-constant for some prime p  ≤  n if, and only if, it is the restriction to G of an irreducible p-constant character of Bn.

Suppose that χ is an irreducible p-constant character of G of non-zero p-defect. Our first goal is to show that χ is the restriction to G of a character [formula] of H = Bn.

So, let χ be the restriction to G of some character χ(α,β) (or one of the two characters χ(α,α)±). Let n = pk + t with 0  ≤  t < p. If pk and t are not both even, we can prove that [formula], arguing as as done proving Theorem [\ref=th:wr], since the classes [formula] and [formula] belong to G.

Suppose now that [formula] and that both pk and t are even. If t  ≥  2, we consider the classes [formula] of G, where [formula] and [formula]. From [formula] we get that α,β are both hooks of length, respectively, pk and t and from [formula] we get β = (t) or (1t). In this case, we have [formula], a contradiction.

Now, let t = 0 and n = pk  ≥  4 be even (whence k  ≥  2). Consider the classes [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. Observe that [formula] if, and only if, n = 2p. From [formula] we get that α,β are both hooks of length, respectively, pk - p and p. However in this case, [formula], unless n = 2p. So, suppose n = 2p and take the class [formula], where [formula]: [formula], unless β = (p) or (1p). In this case, comparison between [formula] and [formula] always produces an absurd.

We conclude that χ is the irreducible restriction to G of [formula] for some [formula]. As we already remarked, the characters [formula] are obtained by inflation from [formula]. Hence, we are left to exclude that the character [formula] is p-constant, even if the corresponding character χα of [formula] is not p-constant. In particular we have to consider suitable conjugacy classes [formula] of p-singular elements of G, such that [formula] does not consist of even parts. However, this was already done in the original proof of Proposition [\ref=pr:An] in [\cite=PZ] and [\cite=end], where the conjugacy classes that were analyzed never consist of even parts.

Finally, we consider the dihedral groups I2(n) of order 2n. Their character table can be found, e.g., in [\cite=JL].

Let G be a group of type I2(n) with n  ≥  3 and let χ be a non-linear irreducible character of G of non-zero p-defect. Then, χ is p-constant for some prime p dividing 2n if, and only if, p = 3 = |G|3 and χ  =  ψn / 3, in the notation of [\cite=JL]. In particular, cχ =  - 1.

Open problems

Our final aim is to characterize the finite groups admitting irreducible p-constant characters of non-zero p-defect. From Propositions [\ref=linear] and [\ref=direct] and Lemma [\ref=lm:center], we are reduced to consider non-linear characters of indecomposable groups with trivial center.

The case cχ  =    ±  1 seems rather difficult (and not so interesting), but one may focus on p-constant characters χ such that |cχ| > 1. Using [\cite=GAP], the following conjecture has been verified for all groups of size less than 1250:

Let G be a finite group admitting an irreducible p-constant character χ such that |cχ| > 1. Then p  ≠  2 and the Sylow p-subgroups of G are homocyclic.

Notice that when cχ  =    ±  1, we can observe a different behavior. For instance, the irreducible character χ of [formula] of degree 9 is 2-constant with cχ =  + 1 and the irreducible character of [formula] of degree 7 is 2-constant with cχ =  - 1. However, in both cases the Sylow 2-subgroups are dihedral of order 8. The smallest group admitting an irreducible p-constant character with |cχ| > 1 is obtained taking p = 3 in the following:

For any odd prime p, there exists a finite group G admitting an irreducible p-constant character χ with cχ =  + 2.

For any prime p, take a 2-dimensional space V defined over the field [formula]. The group [formula] admits an irreducible representation Φ with space of representation V, given by

[formula]

where [formula] are chosen such that a2 + b2 + 1 = 0. Define

[formula]

The group [formula] acts on V as a group of fixed-point free automorphisms and so G(p) is a Frobenius group. The elements of G(p) have order {1,2,4,p}. The irreducible character χ of G(p), obtained by inflation from [formula], is p-constant with cχ =  + 2.

The smallest group that satisfies Conjecture [\ref=conj1] with a Sylow p-subgroup which is not elementary abelian is G248,253 whose structure is [formula], while the smallest one with a Sylow p-subgroup of rank > 2 is G248,730 whose structure is [formula] (here Gk,n denotes the k-th group of size n, according to [\cite=GAP]). In both cases, p = 3 and χ(1) = cχ =  + 2. The smallest group admitting an irreducible p-constant character with cχ <  - 1 is M10 (here cχ =  - 2 and χ(1) = 16), while the smallest perfect group with |cχ| > 1 is the following.

Consider the group [formula], where

[formula]

The group H is isomorphic to [formula] and acts regularly on [formula], hence the group [formula] is a Frobenius group with a single class of 11-singular elements. We get that every irreducible character χ of G is 11-singular of non-zero 11-defect. Also, for χ(1) = 1,2,3,4,5,6 we obtain cχ  =  χ(1) and for χ(1) = 120 we get cχ =  - 1. Clearly the Sylow 11-subgroups of G are elementary abelian of order 112.

Looking at the perfect groups, we can state a stronger version of Conjecture [\ref=conj1]. Indeed, a direct check on the perfect groups of size < 15360, whose character tables are contained in the package AtlasRep 1.5.0, seem to confirm the following.

Let G be a finite perfect group admitting an irreducible p-constant character χ such that |cχ| > 1. Then p = 3, cχ  =    ±  2 and the Sylow 3-subgroups of G are isomorphic to [formula].

Notice that the only sporadic group admitting irreducible p-constant characters with χ  =    ±  2 is the Mathieu group M22, which satisfies Conjecture [\ref=perfect]. The other known simple groups satisfying Conjecture [\ref=perfect] are the groups [formula] when gcd (q - 1,3) = 3 and [formula] when gcd (q + 1,3) = 3. Indeed using the character tables described in [\cite=SF] we may prove that following.

Let [formula] and let r be a prime dividing |G| such that gcd (r,q) = 1. Let δ =  + 1 if [formula], δ =  - 1 if [formula] and let d =  gcd (q - δ,3) Then G admits an irreducible r-constant character of non-zero r-defect if, and only if, one of the following holds:

r divides (q2  +  δq + 1) / d and

χ(1) = q2  +  δq: in this case cχ =  - 1;

χ(1) = q3: in this case cχ  =  δ.

2  ≠  r divides (q + δ) and

χ(1) = q3: in this case cχ =  - δ;

d = 1, r = 3, [formula] and χ(1) = q3  -  δ: in this case cχ  =  δ.

d = r = 3, [formula] and

χ(1) = q2  +  δq: in this case cχ =  + 2;

χ(1) = q3: in this case cχ  =  δ;

[formula]: in this case cχ =  - δ.
