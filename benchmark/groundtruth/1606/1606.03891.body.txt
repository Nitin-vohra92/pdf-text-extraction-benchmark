KdV cnoidal waves in a traffic flow model with periodic boundaries

Introduction

The study of traffic flow has uncovered some interesting phenomena such as the propagation of nonlinear density waves representing congestion. To determine traffic behaviour, a variety of modelling techniques are used, which include the application of car following, cellular automation, gas kinetic and hydro dynamical models. Refer to [\citet=nag02] for a discussion of the different methods.

Here, we concentrate on a car following model that governs vehicle motion on a single lane road with periodic boundaries. The OV model proposed by [\citet=new61] is applied, which is =V(x(t)-x(t)), where xj(t) is the position of car j at time t, τ is the delay time of the driver, V is the optimal velocity and [formula] for N cars on the road. We will examine ([\ref=newell]) when it reduces to a perturbed KdV equation. This occurs only within a certain stability zone, which is referred to as 'metastable'. It is well-known that the unperturbed KdV equation has the travelling wave solution, the cnoidal wave of modulus m, where m∈(0,1) (see [\citet=kdv95]). For m  →  1, this becomes the soliton solution.

[\citet=mur99] explored this traffic flow problem with open boundaries. They derived a perturbed KdV equation from an OV model and then obtained the KdV soliton solution. This result was compared to numerical simulations with good agreement. As well, these solutions were shown to disappear after some time. Later, [\citet=zhu08] performed a similar analysis for periodic boundaries. Numerically they found large amplitude waves with narrow peaks of both upward and downward form, which they referred to as KdV solitons. Nonlinear analysis was also applied to find the soliton solution. The focus of these investigations into the metastable dynamics was the soliton.

Additionally, [\citet=yu10] and [\citet=zho14] performed numerical examinations of traffic OV models, where similar nonlinear behaviour emerged. However, the simulations also revealed steady travelling waves in the metastable region that were of a similar form to the KdV modulated cnoidal wave. Therefore, other KdV solutions besides the soliton can occur in OV models. Hence, further asymptotic work is needed to establish the connection between the numerically observed travelling density waves and the nonlinear analysis. To achieve this, we will apply modulation theory to the perturbed KdV equation so that the entire family of possible solutions to the reduced traffic model are obtained.

[\citet=whi74] developed modulation theory for the KdV equation, which was a multi-scale technique that gave modulated wavetrain solutions. A system of first order partial differential equations describing the modulations were also found, now known as the 'Whitham Equations'. [\citet=gur87] extended the modulation theory to include Burgers damping, where the Whitham equations with additional terms to account for friction were formed. [\citet=myi95] instead incorporated an arbitrary damping term, and then considered three different types of damping to analyse the subsequent wavetrain solutions. The monograph by [\citet=kam00] consisted of a comprehensive derivation of the KdV Whitham Equations. These previous studies will be followed here to obtain the modified Whitham equations, which correspond to our traffic problem.

This paper concentrates on the identification of steady travelling wave solutions of the modulation equations since these are found numerically. More specifically, in Section 2, we outline the traffic OV model and the asymptotic analysis used to then obtain a perturbed KdV equation. Next, in Section 3, a multi-scale perturbation technique is applied to this equation and as a result, the modulation equations are derived. Then, steady solutions of these equations are pursued in Section 4. This asymptotic theory is next related to the traffic problem in Section 5. Lastly, in Section 6, numerical simulations of the OV model are depicted and compared to the asymptotic solutions.

Traffic Flow Model

We outline the transformation of ([\ref=newell]) into a perturbed KdV equation within the metastable zone. Firstly, undertaking a Taylor series expansion of ([\ref=newell]) and expressing this in terms of the vehicle headway, Δxj = xj + 1 - xj, gives =â(V(Δ x(t))-V(Δ x(t))-), where â = 1 / τ is the drivers sensitivity. This model was proposed by [\citet=ban95].

As well, the following optimal velocity function defined by [\citet=ban95] is used V(Δ x(t))=(tanh(Δ x-h)+tanh(h)), where hc is the safety distance and vmax is the maximal velocity. We choose vmax = 2 and hc = 4 for convenience.

[\citet=ge05] outlined three OV models that describe car motion. Here, their Model B is applied, which uses ([\ref=traf_hw]) and ([\ref=veldef]), and has the linear stability criteria τ≤τ=. If this condition is satisfied, then the steady solution to ([\ref=traf_hw]) is stable. This steady state is Δxj(t) = h, where h is the uniform headway. The curve given by τ  =  τs is labelled the 'neutral stability line' as it represents the boundary between no traffic jams and jams.

Moreover, [\citet=ge05] detailed the application of an asymptotic method to reduce ([\ref=traf_hw]) to a perturbed KdV equation, using the change of variables x=-ε(j+V(h)t),  =ε t,  ε=1-(τ/τ),  0<ε≪ 1, and letting Δ x(t)=h+ u.

Consequently, ([\ref=traf_hw]) becomes

[formula]

Perturbation Analysis and the Modulation Equations

A multi-scale perturbation approach that follows [\citet=myi95] is applied to ([\ref=meqnuns]). The monograph by [\citet=whi74] used this perturbation technique for the analysis of the unperturbed system (([\ref=meqnuns]) with ε  →  0) and [\citet=myi95] extended this theory to include an arbitrary damping term.

To begin, let u(x,)=u(θ,X,T)+ε u(θ,X,T)+εu(θ,X,T)+, and introduce the variables

[formula]

Steady Solutions of the Modulation Equations

The differential equations have been derived that govern the modulation of our leading order cnoidal wave solution ([\ref=u0defc5]). We now seek steady solutions to the system ([\ref=modsys])-([\ref=Midef]) by setting the wave speed, c, to a constant. Here, the workings of [\citet=el05] are followed, where steady solutions were found of the fourth order Whitham system for the Kaup-Boussinesq-Burgers equation. This method is now adapted to analyse our third order system.

For c is some constant, =-ω, =k. Also, +Q =(-kν U+kν U +k)=M, where =Q-ν U=,  M=-,  =2(u(u)dθ). Refer to ([\ref=diffint]) to write [formula] in full. Therefore,

[formula]

Application to the Traffic Flow Model

The analysis outlined in Sections 3 and 4 is now applied to the traffic flow problem discussed in Section 2. It is necessary to express the leading order solution in terms of the model ([\ref=traf_hw]) variables, j and t. As well, the equation parameters λ,ν,μ,γ,η are now defined using ([\ref=par_val]).

Without any loss of generality, we firstly set k = 1 (θ = x) and then, c = ω. So, our travelling wave solution in terms of car j's headway at time t is Δ x(t)=h+u(j,t) +O(ε), where, using ([\ref=jttoxtb]), u(j,t)=a(m)b(m)+d(m)   +a(m)(((j+t(V(h)+()))+θ);m). The solution parameter s1 is chosen such that ([\ref=s11]) is satisfied and m is fixed. The solution parameters b,  a and d are defined by ([\ref=abddefc]), ([\ref=adefc5]) and ([\ref=ddefc5NS]) respectively. The speed of this wave is wave speed=V(h)+().

Note that the solutions highlighted in Section 4 are periodic in the θ direction, however, they are not necessarily periodic over the spatial domain j∈[0,N]. Since it is periodic boundaries that are of interest here, we set n T̂=N, where n is some integer that corresponds to the number of oscillations over j∈[0,N] and [formula] is the solution period in the j direction. Hence, P=. If P is defined using ([\ref=pdef]) then ([\ref=pbcon]) holds.

There exist a large number of possible travelling wave solutions that satisfy ([\ref=s11]) and ([\ref=pdef]). To restrict our analysis, we will seek solutions similar to that found numerically by [\citet=zhu08], such that Δ x(0)=h,  =0, and therefore, u(j=0,N;t=0)=0,  (j=0,N;t=0)=0.

So that ([\ref=u0ic]) is met, we set θ0 = P (θ0 is arbitrary at leading order) and ab + d = 0, which gives, using ([\ref=adefc5]) and ([\ref=ddefc5NS]), s(m)=-6(a(m)b(m)+(3+m-2)).

Now, combining ([\ref=s11]) and ([\ref=s12]), and after some manipulation, we arrive at τ=(+6 mK(m)(b+(+m-2)))+. So, τ and therefore â = 1 / τ are functions of (n / N), m and V'(h). Figure [\ref=pp_h35] depicts â(m) for h = 3.5 or 4.5 and h = 2.5 or 5.5. Each curve signifies when a cnoidal wave solution satisfying ([\ref=u0ic]) occurs for some value of integer n and when N = 100 (for 100 cars on the road). Only when â  >  âs will a solution exist (ε > 0). It is apparent that for a fixed â, as n becomes larger, the modulation term m decreases.

From ([\ref=s12]) and ([\ref=tau_def]), it is evident that the wave speed ([\ref=ws_def]) is determined by also specifying (n / N), m and V'(h). The plot of the wave speed is displayed in Figure [\ref=wsfig] for h = 2.5 or 5.5 and h = 3.5 or 4.5 as a function of the modulus m, with each curve corresponding to some choice of n and N = 100. This figure reveals that the wave speed increases with m for some choice of n.

Results

The spatially periodic asymptotic solutions, given by ([\ref=hwdef])-([\ref=u0jt]), are plotted in Figures [\ref=n1]-[\ref=n3n5]. So that ([\ref=u0ic]) holds, P, s1 and τ are defined using ([\ref=pdef]), ([\ref=s12]) and ([\ref=tau_def]) respectively. As well, the OV model ([\ref=traf_hw]) governing the headway is solved numerically with Matlab's ode45, where the periodic boundary conditions ([\ref=pbcon]) are imposed. The initial condition used for the simulation is defined by ([\ref=hwdef])-([\ref=u0jt]) at t = 0. Then, we compare the asymptotic solution with the numerical solution at different time intervals.

In Figure [\ref=n1], the solution for h = 3.5,  â = 1.59,  ε = 0.10372,  N = 100 and n = 1 is shown, where an upward density wave is depicted. The top panel of Figure [\ref=n1] compares the asymptotic solution, given by ([\ref=hwdef])-([\ref=u0jt]), to the numerical findings for t∈[0,100]. The middle panel displays the headway profile for car j = 0,N, where the solid black curve represents the asymptotic solution and the dotted red curve is the ode45 solution. These plots suggest excellent agreement. Next, the simulation is solved over a large time domain and the result is examined in the bottom panel of Figure [\ref=n1] (at around t = 1000 and t = 10000), where the headway profiles for car j = 0,N is displayed. It is evident that numerically, the density wave persists for a considerably long time, although eventually a slight phase shift and a reduction in amplitude develops. It will eventually disappear. This is expected since all the depicted solutions satisfy the linear stability criteria ([\ref=linstab]). Hence, all disturbances will dissolve as t  →    ∞   and Δxj will tend to steady state h, as discussed in Section 2. These observations are consistent with the numerical findings of [\citet=mur99] for solutions in the metastable zone.

Next, in Figure [\ref=n1c], the driver's sensitivity is increased to â = 1.65 (ε = 0.21617), and consequently, the solution is larger in amplitude, with a narrower peak (since m is increased and it is extremely close to 1). This is of a form similar to a soliton, although, as it is actually a cnoidal wave, the periodic boundary conditions are satisfied. [\citet=zhu08] found numerically solutions of this form when they considered periodic boundaries, however they referred to these as solitons. The top panel compares the numerical and asymptotic findings for t∈[0,100]. The bottom panel depicts the headway profiles of car j = 0,N for t∈[0,100] (left) and t∈[800,1000] (right). The asymptotic and numerical solutions are in good agreement. However, as ε is larger, the excellent match observed for â = 1.59 is not achieved here. Moreover, as a result of increasing ε, the solution will disappear significantly faster since a notable phase shift and amplitude reduction appears around t = 900. This behaviour can be attributed to a greater wave speed.

In Figure [\ref=n1e], again solutions for n = 1,  N = 100 are examined except now h = 4.5. The same choice of m and wave speed used for h = 3.5 will apply here. The top panel relates to â = 1.59 (ε = 0.10372) and the bottom to â = 1.65 (ε = 0.21617). Asymptotic solutions for t∈[0,100] are shown on the left, and on the right, the asymptotic solutions for car j = 0,N are compared to the numerical findings. The agreement between these two solutions and the long-time behaviour are consistent with the discussions for h = 3.5. However, now the solution is a downward form density wave since h > hc = 4. [\citet=zhu08] made similar observations, explaining that if h < hc, vehicle j slows down to avoid crashing into vehicle j + 1. As a result, an upward form density wave occurs. Whereas, if h > hc, vehicle j speeds up to the maximal velocity and consequently, a downward form density wave emerges. Given the traffic density is defined as the inverse of the headway, then the upward and downward waves represent clusters of faster and slower moving vehicles respectively.

Now, we investigate the solutions with n = 2, h = 3.5,  N = 100 so that two density waves propagate, see Figure [\ref=n2]. The top panel corresponds to â = 1.59 (ε = 0.10372), and the bottom to â = 1.65 (ε = 0.21617). As exhibited when n = 1, upward and downward waves form when h < hc and h > hc respectively, although solutions with h > hc are not depicted here. On the left, the asymptotic solution over the domain t∈[0,100] is displayed and on the right, a comparison between the numerical and asymptotic findings for car j = 0,N is given. There is good agreement between the two results, especially when ε = 0.10372, which is expected. Once again, these travelling wave solutions will eventually dissolve at very large t, with the â = 1.59 result persisting for a far greater time due to a smaller wave speed. Furthermore, the amplitude is notably larger and narrower for ε = 0.21617, which is a result of increasing m.

Such studies as [\citet=yu10] highlighted numerical density waves with multiple oscillations over the same spatial domain. To obtain this solution type, n can continue to be increased. Analysing these solutions, it becomes apparent that as n grows, for some fixed â, the amplitude and wave speed slightly increases. As well, these solutions are found to have a similar long-time behaviour as that demonstrated for n = 1. As an example, Figure [\ref=n3n5] depicts an asymptotic solution with three oscillations and where â = 1.59,  N = 100,  h = 3.5.

Conclusion

The evolution of traffic behaviour was determined using the OV model ([\ref=traf_hw]). This model has been examined numerically and analytically by various previous studies, with the stability regimes well-outlined (refer to [\citet=ge05]). Here, we concentrated on the metastable zone that corresponded to the onset of traffic jams and where ([\ref=traf_hw]) reduced to the perturbed KdV equation ([\ref=meqnuns]). A multi-scale perturbation analysis was then applied to ([\ref=meqnuns]). As a result, at leading order, the cnoidal wave solution was obtained and at the next order, the Whitham system was derived, which was altered due to the perturbation terms of ([\ref=meqnuns]). Next, steady travelling wave solutions were sought by ensuring the wave speed remained constant. Consequently, the three Whitham equations were transformed into a single equation for the slow variation of the modulation term, m, defined by ([\ref=dmdT]). Setting ([\ref=dmdT]) to zero so that m was fixed over the solution domain then led to the identification of periodic cnoidal wave solutions. This analysis was next applied to the traffic flow problem by defining the leading order solution in terms of car [formula] and imposing the periodic boundary conditions along j∈[0,N]. Thus, a family of travelling wave solutions were highlighted, where the choice of m and the number of oscillations over the spatial domain were shown to determine the driver's sensitivity, â, and the wave speed. Lastly, comparisons between the numerical solutions of the OV model and the asymptotic headway solutions were performed. Overall, a good agreement between the two solutions was observed. Although, the numerical density waves dissolved after a considerable length of time, which is consistent with the linear stability analysis. This paper has provided an extension of other workings that only considered traffic soliton solutions (for example see [\citet=mur99] and [\citet=zhu08]). Instead here modulation theory was used to establish the existence of cnoidal waves in the traffic model.
