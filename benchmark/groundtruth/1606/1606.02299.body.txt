Gap Opening in 3D: Single Planet Gaps

Introduction

Giant planets are expected to open gaps in their natal circumstellar disks (for a review, see [\citealt=Kley12]). Gaps and cavities have been observed in "transitional" disks such as LkCa 15 [\citep=Kraus12] [\citep=Sallum15], TW Hya [\citep=Debes13] [\citep=Akiyama15] [\citep=Nomura16], and HD 169142 [\citep=Quanz13] [\citep=Reggiani14], in addition to the young protoplanetary disk HL Tau [\citep=ALMA_HLTau]. Whether we can say with confidence that these gaps are planetary in origin relies on our understanding of the gap-opening mechanism.

Theoretical studies supported by numerical simulations have investigated how the depths and widths of planetary gaps relate to planet and disk properties [\citep=Crida06] [\citep=Duffell13] [\citep=Fung14] [\citep=Kanagawa15a] [\citep=Kanagawa16]. It has been established from 2D numerical simulations that the surface density within the gap, Σgap, follows a power-law scaling relation with planet mass, disk aspect ratio, and disk viscosity. This relation can be derived from a simple "zero-dimensional" (0D) model, where the planet's global disk-integrated Lindblad torque balances the disk viscous torque ([\citealt=Fung14], hereafter FSC14; [\citealt=Kanagawa15a]; [\citealt=Duffell15]). Whether these results carry over to a realistic 3D disk is not obvious. The Lindblad torque is most strongly exerted in the disk midplane where the planet resides, while the viscous torque applies throughout the disk. [\citet=Kley01] and [\citet=Bate03] reported good agreement between 2D and 3D simulations for a restrictive set of parameters and simulation times (see their Figures 7 and 2, respectively). [\citet=Morbidelli14] reported a meridional circulation inside a planetary gap in their 3D simulations.

Because of the difference in dimensionality, 3D flow patterns cannot be derived from 2D. Flow dynamics specific to 3D can affect disk and planet evolution. For instance, 3D effects may modify the amount of gas that flows around the planet and across the gap, affecting how the planet accretes mass [\citep=Ormel15b] and migrates [\citep=Benitez15]. Also, 3D flow patterns around gap edges may impact dust filtration and trapping at gap edges, processes so far studied mainly in 2D [\citep=Paardekooper06a] [\citep=Rice06] [\citep=Zhu12].

A technical challenge with 3D planetary gap studies is the long computational timescale involved. As shown by FSC14, the time it takes for a gap to come to steady state scales with the disk viscous time, and can be as long as ~  104 planetary orbits when α, the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter [\citep=alpha], is 0.001. This long time, together with the generally more costly nature of 3D simulations, has made it difficult to simulate 3D gaps. Fortunately, these obstacles are gradually being removed by technological advances. In this paper, we perform a systematic parameter space study that reveals the steady-state density and flow structure of 3D gaps, which we will compare to 2D results.

Plan of This Paper

Section [\ref=sec:numerics] details our numerical method and simulation parameters. Section [\ref=sec:gaps] compares 3D gap results with their 2D counterparts. Section [\ref=sec:flow] details the 3D flow field around gaps, and Section [\ref=sec:Rayleigh] investigates the origin of gap unsteadiness. Section [\ref=sec:conclude] concludes and discusses future work.

Numerical Method

We use the graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated hydrodynamics code PEnGUIn [\citep=MyThesis] to simulate planetary gaps. It is a 3D Lagrangian-remap shock-capturing code that uses the piecewise parabolic method [\citep=PPM]. A 2D version of this code was used by FSC14. A 3D version was implemented by [\citet=Fung15] to simulate the flow field around a low-mass planet, using a setup similar to the one employed here. In this section, we recapitulate some of the main features of PEnGUIn, which we will run in both 2D and 3D.

Denoting by {r,φ,θ} the radial, azimuthal, and polar coordinates, and R = r sin θ the cylindrical radius, we write the Lagrangian continuity and momentum equations solved by PEnGUIn as:

[formula]

where ρ is the gas density, [formula] the velocity field, p the gas pressure, [formula] the Newtonian stress tensor, and Φ the combined gravitational potential of the star and the planet. The simulations are performed in the corotating frame of the planet, with the Coriolis force absorbed into the conservative form of Equation [\ref=eqn:moment_eqn] as suggested by [\citet=Kley98]. We adopt a locally isothermal equation of state, such that p = c2ρ, where c is the specified sound speed of the gas. The stress tensor [formula] is proportional to the kinematic viscosity ν, which we parameterize using the α-prescription of [\citet=alpha], such that ν  =  αch, where h is the disk scale height. We fix α = 0.001.

The simulations are performed in a frame centered on the star, so for a planet on a fixed, circular orbit in the disk midplane, Φ equals:

[formula]

where G is the gravitational constant, M = M*  +  Mp the total mass of the star and the planet, q  =  Mp  /  M* the planet-to-star mass ratio, Rp the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, rs the smoothing length of the planet's potential, and φ'  =  φ  -  φp denotes the azimuthal separation from the planet. We set GM = 1 and Rp = 1, so that the Keplerian velocity and frequency [formula] and [formula] both equal 1 at the planet's orbit. The third term in the bracket is the indirect potential. The 2D version of Equation [\ref=eqn:potential] is obtained by substituting the spherical r with the cylindrical R. Note that Equation [\ref=eqn:potential] technically differs from the potential used in FSC14, as PEnGUIn simulations in FSC14 were performed in the barycentric frame. This difference in reference frame should not have a significant effect on our results, as was already tested by FSC14.

One qualitative difference between 2D and 3D setups is in the smoothing length rs. In 2D, rs is chosen to mimic the vertically averaged gravitational force of the planet, and therefore the appropriate choice should be of order the thickness of the disk, h  =  c / Ωk [\citep=Muller12]. In 3D, rs should be set to a value sufficiently small to not interfere with the large-scale gap dynamics of interest here (in contradistinction to the smaller-scale circumplanetary flow). Based on these considerations, we set rs  =  0.5 ~ h0 in our 2D simulations, where h0 is the disk scale height evaluated at the planet's location, and rs  =  0.1 ~ rH in 3D, where rH  =  (q / 3)1 / 3Rp is the planet's Hill radius.

Initial and boundary conditions

The initial disk profile assumes the following surface density and sound speed profiles:

[formula]

[formula]

where we set Σ0  =  1, and choose c0  =  0.05. The disk scale height h is therefore c / Ωk  =  0.05R with Ωk evaluated at the midplane; in other words, the disk aspect ratio h / R = 0.05 is constant. This sound speed profile is fixed in time, corresponding to an irradiated disk that has a cooling time much shorter than the dynamical time. In 3D hydrostatic equilibrium, the initial density structure is:

[formula]

where [formula] is the initial gas density at the location of the planet.

The initial velocity field assumes hydrostatic equilibrium, taking into account gas pressure but not viscosity. As a result, the initial disk has an orbital frequency of

[formula]

and zero radial and polar velocity. Given our isothermal equation of state and sound speed profile, our disk model is subject to the vertical shear instability [\citep=Urpin98] [\citep=Lin15]. However, our disk viscosity of [formula] is sufficient to prevent the instability from growing, as shown by [\citet=Nelson13].

Both the inner and outer radial boundaries are fixed at their initial values. For the polar boundaries in 3D, we enforce symmetry at the midplane to simulate only the upper half of the disk, and use a reflecting boundary condition at the top to prevent mass from entering or leaving the domain.

Resolution

Our simulation domain extends radially from 0.4 to 2 Rp, and spans the full 2π in azimuth. The polar angle in our 3D simulations spans 0 to 12 degrees, equivalent to a vertical extent of 4 scale heights.

We use 270 logarithmically spaced cells in the radial direction, 810 uniformly spaced cells in the azimuthal direction, and 45 uniformly spaced cells in the polar direction. This resolution translates to about 8, 6, and 11 cells per scale height in each of the {r,φ,θ} directions, respectively. This choice is motivated by Figure 2 of FSC14.

Metrics

As in FSC14, we define the surface density in the gap, Σgap, as a spatial average over the annulus spanning R = Rp  -  Δ to Rp  +  Δ with [formula], excised from φ  =  φp  -  Δ / Rp to φp  +  Δ / Rp. Throughout this paper, we will also show velocity plots and maps that are temporal and/or spatial averages. In all instances, velocities are averages weighted by gas density.

Results

Gap depth and shape

We perform four 3D simulations with q varying between 0.0005 and 0.004 (0.5 to 4 MJ). For our parameters, the planet's Hill radius rH ranges from 1.1 to 2.2 times the local disk scale height h0. We also run four 2D simulations using the same parameters for comparison; these are nearly exact replicates of the simulations from FSC14. Figure [\ref=fig:time] plots the gap depth contrast Σgap  /  Σ0 versus time for our 2D and 3D simulations. Because of the costly nature of 3D simulations, we were only able to simulate up to 103 orbits. By comparison, FSC14 ran up to ~  104 orbits to achieve steady state. Comparing our Figure [\ref=fig:time] with Figure 5 of FSC14 indicates that our results for Σgap  /  Σ0 have converged to within a factor of 2 of theirs. We consider such convergence sufficient to identify differences between 2D and 3D gaps. Our results show some time variability, particularly for high-mass runs, that we will investigate in Section [\ref=sec:Rayleigh].

Figure [\ref=fig:time] shows clearly that Σgap behaves in 3D similarly to how it does at lower dimensionality. In particular, the final values of Σgap in 3D scale as q- 2, as predicted by the 0D models of FSC14 and [\citet=Kanagawa15a]. The agreement between 2D and 3D simulations is astonishingly close for [formula]. For Mp = 2MJ and 4MJ, Σgap decreases initially more rapidly in 3D than in 2D, but ultimately reaches a slightly larger value (about ~  80% larger in the case Mp = 2MJ).

For 3D simulations, to verify that our fiducial choice for smoothing length rs  =  0.1rH is sufficiently small, we perform a test case at Mp  =  4MJ with rs  =  0.05rH, and find that Σgap changes negligibly. For 2D simulations, the correct choice of rs is less clear; although any value of order h0 is suitable in principle [\citep=Muller12], the value of Σgap is sensitive to rs. For example, we find that using rs  =  1 ~ h0 instead of our fiducial 0.5 ~ h0 results in a ~  40% larger Σgap. In this regard, we should not overinterpret the exceptionally close agreement between 2D and 3D results.

Figure [\ref=fig:shape] plots the azimuthally averaged surface density profiles, excluding a small ±  Δ / Rp azimuthal range around the planet. In terms of both gap width and the sharpness of gap edges, the 3D gaps are remarkably similar to 2D gaps. The resemblance is confirmed in face-on views of surface density, as presented in Figure [\ref=fig:disks]. The 2D gaps show more distinct streamers within the gaps. These filaments appear related to the Rayleigh instability operating at gap edges, as we discuss in Section [\ref=sec:Rayleigh].

3D Flow Topology

The flow pattern in 3D may be expected to deviate significantly from that in 2D. In 3D, not only are vertical velocities allowed, but radial velocities can be larger since planetary and viscous torques do not have to cancel locally; the former is mostly exerted in the midplane, while the latter can be exerted anywhere.

Figures [\ref=fig:flow_speed] and [\ref=fig:flow_momt] illustrate the meridional flow in our 1MJ and 4MJ simulations. In agreement with the results of [\citet=Morbidelli14], we find that within the gap, there exists a radial flow directed away from the planet's orbit near the midplane, and another flow delivering gas back into the gap at higher altitudes (Figure [\ref=fig:flow_speed]). Whereas [\citet=Morbidelli14] describe a closed, localized circulation, where the gas is trapped in a cyclical flow near the gap, the flow pattern that we uncover is less localized. We find vigorous motion outside the gap as well as inside with multiple eddy-like structures (Figure [\ref=fig:flow_momt]).

Figure [\ref=fig:schm] is a schematic drawing of the overall meridional flow field. Outside the gap, steep density gradients drive a viscous flow into the gap ("gradient-driven" flow shown in red). At the same time, the planet drives a fast, denser midplane flow directed away from the gap ("planet-driven" flow shown in blue). These two flows collide near the gap edges, where more complex flow patterns emerge. Because midplane disk pressure decreases outward, the planet-driven flow encounters little resistance moving beyond the outer gap edge, and is able to reach a radial distance of ~  4 rH away from the planet's orbit before being deflected. By comparison, on the opposite, interior half of the gap, the planet-driven flow is deflected at ~  2 rH because of the higher gas pressure characterizing the inner gap edge. The merger of the gradient-driven and planet-driven flows ("combined" flow shown in magenta) creates eddies whose rotation poles point in the -  φ direction, just outside either gap edge. The eddies are strongest near the planet and persist downstream for ~  1-2 radians.

The meridional eddies extend as high as our vertical simulation boundaries allow. Gas is carried all the way from the disk midplane to a few scale heights above, and back. This vertical circulation enables the system to reach a near-steady state: the angular momentum acquired by a gas element at low altitude, where the planetary torque dominates, nearly cancels with the angular momentum acquired at high altitude, where the viscous torque dominates. This cancellation is nearly but not strictly exact; there is a net residual loss of angular momentum to account for the global viscous torque (i.e., all gas must eventually accrete onto the star).

Figure [\ref=fig:meri_speed] plots the vertically and azimuthally averaged meridional speeds of our 3D simulations. The speeds come within an order of magnitude of the sound speed over distances comparable to the planet's orbital radius, and are supersonic closest to the planet (e.g., there is a Mach ~   5 shock deep inside the 4MJ planet's Hill sphere). The planet's influence extends well beyond Hill sphere scales; for example, the most distant principal Lindblad resonances are located at 0.63 ~ Rp in the inner disk (2:1 resonance), and 1.59 ~ Rp in the outer disk (1:2 resonance).

Figure [\ref=fig:vz_map] plots 2D maps of the vertical velocity vz, vertically averaged over the upper half of the disk above the midplane (recall that our simulations assume reflection symmetry about the midplane), and gives a sense of the flow's azimuthal variations. The fastest downward flows in the gap are concentrated within ~  1 rH of the planet. Farther away azimuthally, the flow speed reduces by factors of a few and fluctuates spatially and temporally. Vertical velocities might be used one day to distinguish planet-opened gaps from other kinds of gaps (e.g., [\citealt=Zhang15]; [\citealt=Bethune16]), provided velocity signatures above and below the disk midplane along the observer's line of sight do not cancel to zero (a net velocity of zero would be obtained if the disk were exactly reflection-symmetric about the midplane, optically thin in the line used to measure Doppler shifts, and viewed face-on).

Rayleigh instability at gap edges

Here we offer an explanation for the origin of gap streamers, sometimes called filaments, that have been observed in gap-opening simulations [\citep=Devalborro06]. These streamers arise from unsteady gap edges. In our simulations, they are seen in both 2D and 3D, but more so in 2D, and when Mp  ≥  2MJ.

The Rayleigh instability can operate at gap edges where the rotation profile is significantly modified by gas pressure gradients. This dynamical instability occurs wherever the specific angular momentum decreases outward:

[formula]

where l = R2Ω is the specific angular momentum. Combining this with Equation [\ref=eqn:omega] imposes a condition on the second radial derivative of the gas pressure, and by extension the sharpness of gap edges [\citep=Yang10]. [\cite=Kanagawa15a] have used this condition to model gap profiles.

Figure [\ref=fig:ang_momt] plots the azimuthally averaged values of ∂l  /  ∂R for our 2D and 3D simulations. For 3D, we plot the midplane values. We find that when Mp  ≥  2MJ in 2D, or Mp  =  4MJ in 3D, the gap edges are Rayleigh unstable. These cases coincide with the appearance of unsteady gap edges and enhanced streamers.

The Rayleigh instability may limit the extent to which gaps can be emptied. As the explicit disk viscosity decreases, the gap deepens, its edges become more prone to instability, and more streamers leak into the gap (see also Section 4.2 of FSC14). Thus the Rayleigh instability serves to provide an effective viscosity, transporting angular momentum outward to counter the planet's torque and establishing a "floor" on the gap surface density.

Summary and Discussion

Previous work on gap opening by planets has been plagued by the question of whether 2D results carry over to realistic 3D disks. We have concluded from our numerical study that at least some features do. For our model parameters, gaps in 2D and 3D share nearly identical depths and widths. Though this result could not have been predicted without explicit 3D calculations like those we have undertaken, the similarity between 2D and 3D is, in retrospect, sensible. The 2D equations are merely the vertically integrated versions of the 3D equations; in 3D, it must still be true that the planetary and viscous torques, averaged over large enough volumes, balance in steady state, as they do in 2D (modulo the small residual from the global viscous torque that eventually brings the entire disk onto the star). The balance in 3D is not achieved by a static cancellation of forces at every point in space, but through a dynamic equilibrium between meridional flows driven by the planet, and meridional flows driven by viscosity.

To recapitulate our main findings:

Gaps carved in 3D by giant planets resemble their 2D counterparts in depth and shape (Figures [\ref=fig:time], [\ref=fig:shape], and [\ref=fig:disks]).

Meridional flows are generated by the spatial mismatch between the planet's torque and the disk's viscous torque (Figures [\ref=fig:flow_speed], [\ref=fig:flow_momt], and [\ref=fig:schm]). The flows extend vertically up to a few scale heights, and radially over distances comparable to the planet's orbital radius (Figure [\ref=fig:meri_speed]).

Velocities near a giant planet's orbit approach and exceed the sound speed. Such fast flows may be used to distinguish planetary gaps from gaps produced by other mechanisms (Figure [\ref=fig:vz_map]).

The steepest gap edges become Rayleigh unstable (Figure [\ref=fig:ang_momt]) and shed streamers that leak into the gap.

There are some caveats regarding our results. First, our viscous disk models may not accurately represent protoplanetary disks, which may instead be turbulent [\citep=Fromang11] [\citep=Shi12]. Second, limited by computational resources, we have not investigated how our results scale with disk viscosity or temperature. A more thorough parameter space study should be possible as computing technology continues to advance. Lastly, insofar as accretion by the planet itself could further reduce the ambient gas density, the Σgap values found in this work should be considered upper limits.

We close by discussing some directions for future work on planet-disk interactions.

Planet Accretion

Disk flows are directed onto the planet above its poles, and away from the planet in the equator plane [\citep=Kley01] [\citep=Klahr06] [\citep=Tanigawa12] [\citep=Morbidelli14] [\citep=Ormel15b] [\citep=Fung15]. The giant planets simulated here should be in the final "runaway" phase of their mass accretion history, when the self-gravity of their gas envelopes is significant. We would expect something like the Bondi accretion theory -- modified to account for the thermodynamics of cooling [\citep=Lee14] -- to apply in the polar direction, with the planet's mass accretion rate scaling in proportion to the ambient density. Gap densities should therefore matter for planet accretion rates and luminosities. The converse should also be true. To assess the effect of planetary accretion on the gap density, we would need to adopt a different planet boundary condition than our present smoothing length prescription.

Meridional Flows

The large-scale vertical and radial flows induced by giant planets may affect a number of disk processes: the radial transport of grains (see, e.g., [\citealt=Ogliore09] for possible implications of the Stardust mission); dust filtration at gap edges which can impact the appearance of transitional disks [\citep=Zhu14]; the ability of dust to settle vertically, which can affect the disk's spectral energy distribution [\citep=Chiang01]; and disk chemistry [\citep=Bergin07] [\citep=Dutrey14].

Gap Opening by Multiple Planets

The wide radial extents of the cavities in transitional disks have led some to invoke gap opening by multiple planets [\citep=Zhu11]. Simulations in 2D of multi-planet gaps have found that common gaps (the merged gaps of more than one planet) have significantly higher gas density than single-planet gaps [\citep=Duffell15], making it more difficult to reproduce the transparency of transition disk holes. We plan to test this result in 3D in a forthcoming paper.
