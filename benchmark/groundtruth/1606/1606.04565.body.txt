High sensitivity phonon-mediated kinetic inductance detector with combined amplitude and phase read-out

Bolometric experiments searching for rare events, such as neutrino-less double beta decay or dark matter interactions, are now focusing on the development of cryogenic light detectors to enable background suppression exploiting the different light yield of different particles[\cite=Wang:2015taa]. The ideal light detector should provide excellent energy resolution (<  20 eV RMS), wide active surface (5×  5 cm2), reliable and reproducible behavior, and the possibility of operating hundreds/thousands of channels. Unfortunately, none of the existing technologies (see Refs. [\cite=Casali:2014vvt] [\cite=Gironi:2016nae] [\cite=Angloher2016] and references therein) is ready to fulfill all these requirements without further R&D. Since most of the proposed detectors are limited by the number of channels that can be easily installed and operated, the CALDER project[\cite=CalderWhitePaper] aims to develop a new light detector starting from devices that are naturally multiplexed, such as the Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs).

In superconductors, the oscillation of Cooper pairs under the effect of an AC (microwave) probe results in the formation of a kinetic inductance. A KID can be realized by inserting the inductor (L) in a high merit factor (Q) RLC circuit with resonant frequency [formula]. Interactions in the superconductor can break Cooper pairs into quasiparticles, increasing L and thus reducing f0. The increase in the quasiparticles density results in a higher resistance and, therefore, in a lower Q. The signal consists in phase and amplitude variations of the wave transmitted past the circuit.

Thanks to the high sensitivity and to the multiplexed read-out, KIDs have been proposed in several physics sectors, like photon detection[\cite=Day:2003fk], astrophysics[\cite=Monfardini2011] [\cite=Mazin:2013wvi], search for dark matter interactions[\cite=Golwala2008], and for the read-out of transition-edge sensors arrays[\cite=Noroozian:2013] [\cite=Giachero:2016ehv]. The installation of devices based on KIDs is quiet simple, as hundreds of resonators can be operated with two coaxial cables and one cryogenic amplifier, while the rest of the electronics can be located at room temperature. Furthermore, their behavior shows a negligible dependence on the temperature, as long as they are operated well below the superconductor critical temperature. From these considerations, it is clear that KIDs show all the desirable features for an innovative light detector with the exception of a wide active surface: macro-bolometers used by experiments such as CUORE[\cite=Artusa:2014lgv] and CUPID-0[\cite=Artusa:2016maw] are characterized by surfaces of several cm2, while typical KIDs sizes barely reach few mm2. This limit can be overcome by following the phonon mediated approach[\cite=swenson] [\cite=moore2]: photons are coupled to the KIDs through a large insulating substrate, that converts them into phonons. The athermal phonons that are not thermalized or lost through the substrate supports, reach the superconductor and break Cooper pairs, giving rise to the signal.

The first CALDER prototype[\cite=Cardani:2015tqa], obtained by depositing four 40 nm thick Al KIDs on a 2×  2 cm2, 300 μm thick Si substrate, reached a combined baseline resolution of [formula] eV and a single KID energy conversion efficiency of 3.1 - 6.1% depending on the position of the source. In this paper we present a resonator design that allows to improve the KID efficiency up to 7.4 - 9.4%, and to achieve a baseline resolution of [formula] eV with a single KID on a similar substrate.

To optimize the detector performance we tested KIDs with different geometries and coupling quality factors Qc on 2×  2 cm2, 380 μm thick, high resistivity (>  10 kΩ  ×  cm) Si(100) substrates. We deposited a single KID on each substrate in order to characterize the detector response in absence of cross-talk or competition among pixels in the absorption of the propagating phonons. All the tested prototypes showed a low-frequency noise in the phase direction, already observed in Ref.[\cite=Cardani:2015tqa] that limited the energy resolution. Because of the excess noise, most of the detectors featured baseline energy resolutions ranging from 140 to 180 eV RMS, preventing a real breakthrough with respect to the previous prototype ([formula] eV). For this reason, we decided to optimize the signal height by increasing Q. To obtain a high value of Q, we increased Qc up to [formula]. In addition, since thicker films are generally characterized by a better quality of the superconductor, we used a 60 nm thick film to ensure a high internal quality factor Qi (1/Q = 1/Qc + 1/Qi). Finally, we enlarged the active area of the KID with respect to the prototype of Ref.[\cite=Cardani:2015tqa] from 2.4 to 4.0 mm2, in order to increase the fraction of phonons that can be collected before being lost in the substrate. A comparison of the new design with the one described in Ref.[\cite=Cardani:2015tqa] is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:design].

The resonator was patterned by electron beam lithography on a single Al film deposited using electron-gun evaporator (more details on the design and fabrication can be found in Ref.[\cite=Colantoni2016]). The chip was mounted in a copper holder using PTFE supports with total contact area of about 3 mm2, and connected to SMA read-out by ultrasonic wire bonding. The detector was anchored to the coldest point of a 3He/4He dilution refrigerator with base temperature of 10 mK. The output signal was fed into a CITLF4 SiGe cryogenic low noise amplifier[\cite=amply] with TN  ~  7 K. Details about the room-temperature electronics and acquisition can be found in Refs.[\cite=CalderWhitePaper] [\cite=Bourrion:2011gi] [\cite=Bourrion:2013ifa].

The resonance parameters (Q, Qc, Qi, f0) were derived by fitting the complex transmission S21 measured in a frequency sweep around the resonance (Fig. [\ref=fig:fit_resonances]). For this purpose, we used a model[\cite=Casali:2015bhk] accounting for possible resonance distortions caused by the absorbed power and by the impedance mismatch between the chip and the RF line. The large Q[formula] limits the accuracy on the evaluation of Qi, which is however very high: at low microwave power (Pμw), where Qi saturates, we obtain Q[formula] and Q[formula]. To test the reproducibility of this device, we fabricated and measured another prototype with the same design, obtaining compatible values of Qc and Qi.

We derived the fraction α of kinetic inductance to the total inductance. We measured the shift of the resonant frequency as a function of the temperature between 10 and 400 mK. We fitted the obtained data to the Mattis Bardeen theory using the approximated formulas derived by Gao et al.[\cite=GAOvsMattisBardeen], in which the only free parameters are α and the superconductor gap 2Δ0. Since these parameters are found to be highly correlated in the fit, we performed a direct and independent measurement of the transition temperature to infer Δ0. We obtained [formula] K, corresponding to [formula]eV. Fixing Δ0 in the fit, we derived [formula]. This results is compatible with the one obtained by fitting the variations in Qi as a function of temperature.

We acquired 12 ms long time windows with sampling frequency of 500 kHz for the real (I) and imaginary (Q) parts of S21. I and Q were then converted during the off-line analysis into amplitude (δA) and phase (δφ) variations relative to the center of the resonance circle. The typical response in δA/δφ to optical pulses with nominal energy of 15.5 keV, obtained by averaging hundreds of events to suppress random noise contributions, is reported in the inset of Fig. [\ref=fig:PulsesAndNoise]. Pulses were produced by a room-temperature 400 nm LED, coupled to an optical fiber facing the backside of the chip to prevent direct illumination. The optical system was calibrated at room temperature using a photomultiplier and correcting the results with a Monte Carlo simulation that accounted for the geometry of the final set-up (including the reflectivity of the materials). The room-temperature calibration was cross-checked at lower temperatures using a 57Co  X-rays source (main peaks at 6.4 and 14.4 keV).

Thanks to the high resonator Q, we obtained a signal height of ~  5.8 mrad/keV in δφ and 0.6 mrad/keV in δA, about a factor 6 larger with respect to δφ and δA obtained with our previous prototype[\cite=Cardani:2015tqa]. In the low frequency region of the average noise power spectrum (Fig. [\ref=fig:PulsesAndNoise]), which is the region of interest for the signal development, the amplitude noise is much lower than the phase one and consistent with the noise temperature of the amplifier. For this reason, even if the amplitude signals are smaller than the phase ones, the signal-to-noise ratios are similar.

Pulses and noise windows of δA and δφ were processed with the matched filter[\cite=Gatti:1986cw]. Furthermore, we implemented a bi-dimensional matched filter to combine them to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. The transfer function of the filter is: [formula], where h is a normalization constant, S is the vector of the amplitude and phase template signals, and N is the covariance matrix of the noise.

To determine the optimal microwave power, we studied the signal-to-noise ratio after the matched filter, and chose Pμw that allowed to maximize this parameter: Poptμw =  - 62 dBm. Finally, we calibrated the energy scale and checked the linearity of the detector response by means of optical pulses of fixed energies (from 3 to 31 keV).

The optimization of the KID geometry allows to improve the detector efficiency and, therefore, the energy resolution. The efficiency η can be computed by comparing the nominal energy E with the energy absorbed by the resonator: [formula], where δnqp is the variation of the number of quasiparticles. To compute δnqp, we deepen the analysis proposed by Moore et al.[\cite=moore2] by considering the dependence of the KID response on its effective temperature and by extending the analysis also to the amplitude signal (in addition to the phase one). The efficiency can be estimated from amplitude and phase variations through the following formulae:

[formula]

where N0V is the single spin density of states at the Fermi level (N[formula] eV- 1μm- 3 for Al) multiplied for the active volume of the resonator V, and S1(f0,T)/S2(f0,T) are functions of Δ0, of the effective detector temperature T (that depends on Pμw) and of the resonant frequency f0[\cite=moorePhD].

We made a temperature scan at low microwave power to relate the frequency shift to the detector temperature. At base temperature we measured the frequency shift at each microwave power to infer the effective temperature and compute S1(f0,T) and S2(f0,T). We then computed ηφ and ηA as a function of Pμw (Fig. [\ref=fig:gain]) and observe that they differ by less than 35%, even if we used independent formulae for the calibration of phase and amplitude. For Pμw larger than -62 dBm the resonance becomes too asymmetric to extract the frequency shift and, thus, the effective temperature. Since S1(f0,T) depends rather sharply on the effective detector temperature (inset of Fig. [\ref=fig:gain]), the uncertainty becomes too large to study ηA above -62 dBm. On the other hand, in the temperature range of interest S2(f0,T) varies by less than 10% and thus the values of ηφ are more trustworthy. Using this estimator, we observe a clear decrease of the efficiency with the increase of the microwave power. This behavior is likely due to the non-linearity of the resonator, which at high powers is characterized by response bifurcation[\cite=swenson2013].

The detector efficiency was inferred from two measurements: by illuminating a ~  6 mm diameter spot as far as possible from the resonator, and by placing the source below the KID (always on the opposite face of the substrate). The first configuration was chosen to be conservative, as placing the source far from the KID decreases the phonon collection efficiency. At Poptμw, we obtained [formula] with the optical source far from the KID, and [formula] with the source below the KID. Thus, the new geometry allows to improve the efficiency, that for the detectors reported in Ref.[\cite=Cardani:2015tqa] reached the maximum value of 6.1%, when placing the source as close as possible to the resonator. Since the energy resolution scales linearly with the detector efficiency, we expect a similar improvement also in the sensitivity. We highlight that working at powers lower than Poptμw would allow to further increase the efficiency, as the signal height becomes larger. Nevertheless, at lower powers the signal-to-noise ratio on the amplifier decreases, worsening the energy resolution.

The energy resolution of the detector (biased with Poptμw) was first evaluated using δA and δφ separately for a comparison with the other prototypes, and then by combining the two estimators with the bi-dimensional matched filter. The results reported in Fig. [\ref=fig:resolution] were obtained illuminating the region far from the KID using optical pulses with energy ranging from 3 to 31 keV.

The points at zero energy indicate the baseline resolution σbaseline, which is the parameter of interest to quantify the detector sensitivity. To compute σbaseline we plotted the distribution of the baseline amplitude (in δφ, δA and their combination) after the matched-filter, and performed Gaussian fits to extract the RMS. The resulting baseline resolutions are [formula] eV in phase and [formula] eV in amplitude. We attribute the competitive resolution of the amplitude readout to the high values of Q and Qi.

The combination of the amplitude and phase signal results in a resolution of [formula] eV, almost a factor 2 better with respect to Ref. [\cite=Cardani:2015tqa] and with a single resonator instead of four. This value is rather conservative, as the source was placed as far as possible from the KID. We made a measurement with a source placed below the KID, obtaining a combined baseline resolution of [formula] eV.

Finally, we studied the detector behavior as a function of the temperature. The typical detector response to 15.5 keV optical pulses is shown in the inset of Fig. [\ref=fig:ResolutionVsT]. The dependency of the decay time on the temperature allowed us to identify it as the quasiparticles recombination time, that at low temperature amounts to ~  400 μs. On the contrary, the rise time does not depend on the temperature and, because of the high Q, is dominated by the ring-time of the resonator (18 μs). In Fig. [\ref=fig:ResolutionVsT] we report the baseline resolution as a function of the temperature. This study proves that the detector performance is not affected by the temperature increase up to 200 mK.
