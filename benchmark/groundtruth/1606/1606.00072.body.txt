Top-philic Scalar Dark Matter with a Vector-like Fermionic Top Partner

Introduction

The discovery of a new scalar particle at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) whose properties are similar to those of the Higgs boson predicted in the Standard Model (SM) within the current experimental uncertainties was a huge success of particle physics community [\cite=Chatrchyan2012] [\cite=Aad2012]. However, the nature of Dark Matter (DM) which occupies about 26% of the current energy content of the Universe [\cite=PlanckCollaboration2015-overview] is still a big puzzle. Since the SM cannot provide a suitable candidate for DM, many new physics models have been proposed to accommodate this new kind of matter. The simplest extension of the SM would be a model with a singlet scalar DM S which couples to the SM through the following Higgs portal (HP):

[formula]

In the above Lagrangian a discrete Z2 symmetry is assumed under which the DM is odd while the SM particles are even, which ensures stability of the DM. There are only two new parameters in this simple model, namely a DM mass parameter μS and a renormalizable quartic coupling λSH. The phenomenology of this simple Higgs portal model has been well studied (see for example [\cite=Cline2013] and the references therein). The more-extended fermionic and vector Higgs portal models were studied in [\cite=Baek:2011aa] [\cite=Baek:2012se].

Apart from DM, top quark may also be a window to new physics beyond the SM. As the heaviest quark in the SM, it has the largest Yukawa coupling to the Higgs boson which implies it may play a special role in the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). Top quark also provides the largest contribution to the running of Higgs quartic coupling λH. A small change of top quark mass can significantly shift the energy scale where λH becomes negative [\cite=Degrassi:2012ry], which makes the precise measurement of top quark properties very important for new physics studies at high energy scale.

Consequently, it is well motivated to connect the DM sector to top quark and a specially interesting scenario is the DM which couples only to the top quark sector. Some top-philic new particle sectors and/or DM models can be found in [\cite=Kilic:2015vka] [\cite=Beck:2015cga] [\cite=Cox:2015afa] [\cite=Berger:2011xk] [\cite=Cheung:2010zf]. Different from previous studies, in this work we consider a top-philic scalar DM model by extending the above Higgs portal model with a vector-like fermionic particle T (topVL) which is also odd under the unbroken discrete Z2 symmetry. We require DM S to couple to T and the right-handed (RH) top quark tR via a Yukawa interaction with coupling yST. The Lagrangian including the Yukawa and new covariant kinetic terms reads:

[formula]

where Dμ is the SM covariant derivative. While the scenario of vector-like doublet coupling to the left-handed (LH) doublet q3L = (tL,bL)T is completely analogous, in order to avoid any constraint from the bottom quark sector, we will focus on the tR case in this work. The gauge invariance requires the top partner T to be also [formula] singlet and have the same hyperchage as tR. Note that the Z2-odd parity assigned to T forbids it from mixing with the SM top quark, thus the current LHC constraints on heavy vector-like quarks do not apply here [\cite=Aad:2015kqa] [\cite=Khachatryan:2015axa].

The above Yukawa interaction terms will generate DM annihilation SS  →  t through t-channel and the co-annihilations TS,T. Since the Higgs portal interaction shown in eq.([\ref=eq:LSH]) can also provide the SS  →  t process in the s-channel, there will be interference with the topVL portal which can be either constructive or destructive. As we will discuss later, when the Higgs portal interaction is closed by setting λSH = 0, the topVL portal can be effective by itself to obtain the observed thermal relic density [formula]. However, interplay with the Higgs portal can shift the topVL portal parameter space due to the interference in SS  →  t and the other annihilation channels provided by Higgs portal.

Another feature of this model is that S can couple to the gluon via the 1-loop box diagram with t and T running inside [\cite=Hisano2015]. This effective coupling CSSgg will provide the DM annihilation SS  →  gg and we found that large yST  ~  O(10) can make SS  →  gg dominate in the mS < mt region. Due to the absence of valence top quark in the nucleon, in this model it is the CSSgg coupling that generates DM-nucleon scattering in the direct detection (DD), which can be large and simply determined by ΩDMh2≃0.12 when SS  →  gg dominates the DM annihilation. We found that the current LUX results can exclude the SS  →  gg dominating scenario and the expected sensitivity of XENON-1T may further test [formula], and [formula] may be covered in the future LUX-ZP experiment.

The collider search for this model can be performed through the pair production T which is dominated by the QCD processes. The top partner will decay 100% into top quark and DM when kinematically open and produce [formula] signal which has been searched for at the CMS experiment with 19.7 fb- 1 data at 8 TeV [\cite=Khachatryan2015]. We first validated our simulation by reproducing the results in CMS paper and then studied the signal strength of this top-philic DM model. We found that mT can be excluded between 300 (450)-850 GeV for mS =0 (200) GeV.

We note that a similar model was anaylized in Ref. [\cite=Giacchino:2015hvk] where DM couples only to light quarks uR or dR. Our model is phenomenologically distinguished from theirs in several aspects. For example, when the Higgs portal interaction is turned off, the DM annihilation channel SS  →  q(q = u,d) is dominated by d-wave for mq  →  0 in the light quark portal model, while s-wave is allowed in our case. Also in the absence of the Higgs portal, DM scattering off the nucleon occurs at the tree-level in their case, while it occurs only via one-loop processes in our scenario. The LHC signature in our model is also different from Ref. [\cite=Giacchino:2015hvk] which contains [formula], while ours is [formula]. Different from Ref. [\cite=Giacchino:2015hvk] which neglected the Higgs portal interaction, we considered the interplay between the topVL and Higgs portal. Other models where DM interacts with the SM leptons were considered in [\cite=Toma:2013bka] [\cite=Giacchino:2013bta] [\cite=Baek:2015fma] [\cite=Baek:2015fea].

This paper is organized as follows. In section [\ref=section_RD] we study the various mechanisms in this top-philic scalar DM model to obtain the observed thermal relic density and the interplay among these mechanisms. In section [\ref=section_DD] we investigate the CSSgg contribution to the DM direct detection through the loop process. In section [\ref=section_ID] we discuss the current constraints on this model from Fermi gamma-ray observations of dwarf galaxies and line spectrum. In section [\ref=section_collider] we study the collider signal of this model based on the CMS [formula] measurement at 8 TeV. We present the combined results in Section [\ref=section_combine] and finally conclude in Section [\ref=section_conclusion].

Thermal Relic Density

The DM annihilation in this top-philic model can occur mainly via three different interactions: Higgs portal, topVL portal and the effective CSSgg coupling. Since the Higgs portal mechanism has been well studied in other works, we will first focus on the topVL portal by setting λSH = 0. We also manually set CSSgg = 0 since, as we will see later in section [\ref=subsection_SSgg], it is only effective with large [formula] and in the mS < mt region where the topVL portal is not sufficient. Then we turn on the CSSgg coupling to see its contribution to the DM annihilation compared to SS  →  t and co-annihilations. Finally we will bring the Higgs portal contribution back by setting λSH  =  λ0(mS)  rλ where λ0(mS) is the proper λSH in the Higgs portal for mS to obtain the observed relic density, while rλ is some fractions such as 0.1,0.2,0.5,1.0 to control the Higgs portal strength. With these settings we are able to see the interplay between these two portals which can be either constructive or desctructive in different parameter space.

TopVL Portal

DM in this model can annihilate via the topVL portal into t final state. Both the DM and top partner can co-exist in thermal equilibrium in the early Universe when [formula] with Tf the temperature at freeze out [\cite=PhysRevD.43.3191]. This allows co-annihilations [formula] which can become important when SS  →  t is kinematically closed or not efficient. We implemented this top-philic DM model with FeynRules [\cite=Alloul2014] and used micromegas [\cite=Belanger2015] [\cite=Belanger2014] to calculate the DM thermal relic density.

In fig.[\ref=fig:mdm_vs_r_topVL] we show contours with ΩDMh2 = 0.12 which was measured by Planck [\cite=PlanckCollaboration2015], in the plane of mS versus mass ratio r = mT / mS for Yukawa coupling yST=0.3, 0.5, 1.0. Note that here in order to focus on the topVL portal exclusively, we have set λSH,CSSgg=0. We can see that for [formula] where SS  →  t is mostly below the threshold, r = mT / mS must be close to 1 to annihilate efficiently. The co-annihilation processes become important as we can see from the fact that r  ≈  1. However, larger yST can alleviate this tension to some extent which can be seen for mS=170 GeV where we have r=1.2, 1.25, 2.0 for yST=0.3, 0.5, 1.0. When SS  →  t becomes kinematically open, the production of on-shell t can enhance the annihilation significantly. In order not to annihilate too fast the mass ratio r in this case needs to deviate from 1 more than the mS < mt case. This is especially apparent for larger yST and for mS=225 GeV we have r=1.25, 2.2, 4.5 for yST=0.3, 0.5, 1.0. When DM mass becomes even heavier, the total annihilation cross section will receive overall suppression from the heavy propagator and/or smaller phase space, in which case the mass ratio r also needs to be close to 1. In this regime the co-annihilation processes become important again. Again, larger yST provides the topVL portal more room to cope with the suppression. For yST=0.3, 0,5, 1.0, it is not until mS= 300, 450, 800 GeV that r drops back to the value in the mS < mt range.

TopVL and CSSgg coupling

Now we study the effective CSSgg coupling between DM and gluon which has been calculated in [\cite=Hisano2015]. However, since the top quark mass is heavy, we should not use the approximated result in the limit mt  ≪  mS,mT. Instead, we used the full expression of CSSgg presented there. In the following we still turn off the Higgs portal by setting λSH = 0 and concentrate on how CSSgg contributes to the DM annihilation in the light DM mass range. CSSgg depends on mS,r = mT / mS,yST in which the Yukawa coupling yST is a universal factor (see eq. (53) in [\cite=Hisano2015]). We will first extract the overall factor and define [formula] and focus on the structure of C'SSgg with respect to mS,r. In fig.[\ref=fig:cssgg_prime] we show how C'SSgg varies with DM mass mS for different choices of mass ratio r.

The first thing one can notice is that C'SSgg is nearly independent of r = mT / mS for very small mS and can be very small [formula]. For a fixed r, the value of C'SSgg will increase with increasing mS first and then drop, except for the r = 1 degenerate case where C'SSgg will approach a constant. Larger maximum C'SSgg is obtained for smaller r and the point where C'SSgg starts to drop occurs at larger mS. For a fixed DM mass mS the larger mass ratio r will decrease C'SSgg, especially for large mS. These features suggest that in fig.[\ref=fig:mdm_vs_r_topVL] when SS  →  t is efficient, where DM mass is moderate and r is relatively large, CSSgg is generally suppressed and we checked that SS  →  t in this region occupies almost 100% of the DM annihilation (see fig.[\ref=fig:fc] below). However, when SS  →  t is kinematically closed or not efficient, SS  →  gg may play an important role, which can be more significant in the mS < mt region where gg final state receives much smaller phase space suppression compared to co-annihilation. We should not forget that y2ST is an overall factor in the full CSSgg which implies that the curve with larger yST in fig.[\ref=fig:mdm_vs_r_topVL] can result in larger SS  →  gg contribution.

In fig.[\ref=fig:fc] we show the contributions to the DM annihilation from different channels, for yST = 0.3,0.5,1.0,10. One can clearly see that the contribution from SS  →  t (green solid line) starts to dominate the annihilation when kinematically open. With even heavier DM mass of several hundreds of GeV, it is the co-annihilation channel T  →  q,gg (blue and purple dotted line) that dominates the contribution. However, larger yST can help SS  →  t dominate a wider DM mass range. As for the mS < mt region, co-annihilations TS  →  W+b,gt (magenta and red dashed line) have the largest contributions in most cases, while with larger yST > 1 the SS  →  gg (cyan solid line) can increase rapidly. In the extreme case with very large yST = 10, SS  →  gg and SS  →  t will dominate in most of the mS < mt and mS > mt region, respectively. This can be understood from the fact that SS  →  gg depends on y2ST while the co-annihilation ST depends only on yST, which means SS  →  gg can benefit more from large yST > 1 than the co-annihilation ST.

Interplay between TopVL and Higgs portal

Now we study the interplay between the topVL and Higgs portal. Note that the Higgs portal will interfere with the topVL portal only in the channel SS  →  t, which by itself only occupies a small branch fraction in the Higgs portal annihilation (below 10%, see fig.2 in ref [\cite=Cline2013]). Thus we would expect generally constructive contributions to the total annihilation cross section from other channels provided by the Higgs portal. For each model point on it in fig.[\ref=fig:mdm_vs_r_topVL] with different DM mass mS, we set the Higgs portal coupling to be λSH  =  λ0(mS)  rλ where λ0(mS) is the proper λSH in the Higgs portal for mS to obtain the observed relic density, and rλ is chosen to be 0.1,0.2,0.5,1.0 to control the Higgs portal strength. If the modified relic density is larger than those in fig.[\ref=fig:mdm_vs_r_topVL] (which is 0.12), then there must be destructive interference from SS  →  t between the topVL and Higgs portal resulting in a decreased total annihilation cross section. However, if the relic density becomes smaller we can not claim the interference is constructive since the Higgs portal also provides other channels which will increase the annihilation cross section. Note that here we consider [formula], which means the CSSgg contribution is negligible in most cases, especially for the DM mass ranges discussed here (mt  <  mS  <  1TeV).

In fig.[\ref=fig:topVL_H_inteference] we show the modified relic density with rλ = 0.1,0.2,0.5,1.0 for yST=0.5. The vertical axis shows the ratio of ΩtopVL + HPh2 to ΩtopVLh2(=0.12) in fig.[\ref=fig:mdm_vs_r_topVL]. One can see that when rλ is small (e.g. 0.1,0.2,0.5) there are DM mass windows where ΩtopVL + HP  /  ΩtopVL > 1 which means there exists destructive SS  →  t interference between the topVL and Higgs portal. However, for larger rλ the other annihilation channels in the Higgs portal increases the total cross section significantly and results in an underproduced relic density. These features can also be seen from fig.[\ref=fig:mdm_vs_r_topVL_H] on the same plane as fig.[\ref=fig:mdm_vs_r_topVL], but including contributions from both topVL and Higgs portal to get the correct relic density. For relatively large rλ (e.g. 0.9), the significant contribution from the Higgs portal requires the mass ratio r in topVL portal to further deviate from 1 in order not to annihilate too fast. For smaller rλ (e.g. 0.5), however, the parameter shift is relatively small and r can be reduced due to destructive interference.

Direct Detection

Since the DM direct detection in Higgs portal models has been studied intensively in the literatures, here we turn off the Higgs portal scattering by setting λSH=0 and focus on the CSSgg loop induced scattering. The real scalar DM-nucleon elastic scattering cross section in terms of Wilson coefficient based on DM-parton effective operators can be found in [\cite=Hisano2015]. Here we capture some of the relevant points.

We start with the effective Lagrangian of the interactions between the real scalar DM S and partons

[formula]

with

[formula]

where αs is the strong couplings constant and GAμν is the field strength tensor of the gluon field. The spin-independent (SI) coupling of the real scalar S with a nucleon can be defined as

[formula]

with

[formula]

where f(N)Tq is the quark mass fraction defined as [formula] [\cite=PhysRevD.81.014503] [\cite=PhysRevD.87.034509] [\cite=Alarcon:2011zs] [\cite=Alarcon:2012nr] and [formula] [\cite=SHIFMAN1978443]. Finally the SI scattering cross section of the real scalar with the target nucleus with mass mtar can be expressed as

[formula]

Since there is no valence top quark in the nucleon, we only need to consider the gluon contribution here. Consequently, the loop coupling CSSgg plays a unique role in the direct detection when Higgs portal is turned off.

In fig.[\ref=fig:DD] the magenta solid, dash and dot lines are the current LUX bound [\cite=LUXCollaboration2015] and anticipated sensitivity of XENON-1T and LUX-ZP [\cite=DMtools], respectively. The solid red, green, blue and cyan curves correspond to yST=0.3, 0.5, 1.0 and 10 which include the topVL and CSSgg contribution to obtain the observed relic density. One can see that the relaxed r due to on-shell produced SS  →  t will suppress CSSgg and thus σSIp, especially for large yST = 1.0,10 because they have larger r (see fig.[\ref=fig:mdm_vs_r_topVL]). However, as discussed in section [\ref=subsection_SSgg], SS  →  gg with large yST > 1 can increase rapidly and dominate over co-annihilation in some range of mS < mt where SS  →  t is mostly kinematically unavailable or inefficient. In this case, since the scattering process occurs via the crossed diagrams of the DM annihilation, CSSgg (and thus fN) is independent of yST and fixed to the proper value depending on mS to obtain the observed relic density. One can clearly see that yST = 10 makes SS  →  gg dominate in a wide range of mS < mt (see fig.[\ref=fig:fc]) where σSIp only depend on the DM mass (see eq.([\ref=eq:cs])). We found that the current LUX results can exclude this SS  →  gg dominating scenario for any sufficiently large yST, although the perturbative [formula] is beyond the current LUX sensitivity. However, the future XENON-1T experiment may be capable of detecting [formula] for DM mass below around 100 GeV, while the LUX-ZP experiment may further cover the smaller [formula].

Indirect Detection

Recently the sensitivity of DM indirect detection has been close to the canonical thermal annihilation cross section. In today's Universe, DM S in our model mainly annihilate into t when mS > mt, while SS  →  gg is the dominant annihilation channel for mS < mt. Here we consider the updated results of Fermi gamma-ray observations of continuous spectrum from dwarf galaxies [\cite=Ackermann:2015zua] as well as the line spectrum from the Galactic center region [\cite=Ackermann:2015lka]. We do not consider the constraints from charged cosmic particles such as positron and anti-proton due to the relatively large uncertainties of their propagation models.

We first recall some main points of the analysis method based on the results of dwarf galaxy observations [\cite=PhysRevLett.107.241303]. The number of photon events observed can be divided into two independent factors: one corresponding to the particle physics process and one describing the astrophysical information of the dwarf galaxies. The expected number of signal events can be expressed as

[formula]

where Aeff is detector's effective area and Tobs is the exposure time. The J factor contains the astrophysical information of the DM distribution and is defined by

[formula]

where the integration is performed along the line of sight in a direction ψ and over a solid angle ΔΩ.

For self-conjugate DM particles χ the particle physics part is defined as

[formula]

where mχ is the DM mass and 〈σAv〉 is the total velocity-averaged cross section of DM annihilation into SM particles in today's Universe. The f denotes the annihilation channels and Bf their branching fractions. For a given channel, dNf / dE is its own final gamma-ray spectrum and the integration from threshold energy Eth to mχ gives the total number of photons emitted [formula].

Since the constraint on 〈σv〉t is not given in Fermi dwarf galaxies results [\cite=Ackermann:2015zua], we converted the b bound to t using 〈σv〉t  =  〈σv〉b  Nγ,b / Nγ,t as done in [\cite=Bringmann:2012vr] [\cite=Giacchino:2015hvk]. The constraints on 〈σv〉gg are obtained in [\cite=Bringmann:2012vr] [\cite=Giacchino:2015hvk] in a similar way. In our model, both t and gg channels will contribute to the final gamma-ray spectrum, thus both the 〈σv〉t and 〈σv〉gg bounds will put constraints on the cross section 〈σv〉t  +  〈σv〉gg. We also notice that the contribution from SS  →  tγ is always negligibly small, which is different from the light quark scenario in [\cite=Giacchino:2015hvk].

As for the implementation of line spectrum observations, constraints can be obtained on 〈σv〉γγ which is generated from the same diagram as the effective SSgg coupling by replacing g with γ. The ratio of cross section 〈σv〉γγ  /  〈σv〉gg is given by [\cite=Chu:2012qy]

[formula]

where Qt is the top quark electric charge in term of |e|.

In fig.[\ref=fig:ID] we show the indirect detection constraints on the samples of fig.[\ref=fig:fc] which include the topVL and CSSgg contribution to obtain the observed relic density. Similar to the LUX bound in direct detection, current Fermi results from both dwarf and Galactic center observations can exclude the SS  →  gg dominating scenario. Moreover, if the sensitivity from dwarf observations can be improved by one order of magnitude, then a large part of the SS  →  t dominating region will also be excluded, pushing DM mass to be heavier than about 400, 600, 1000 GeV for yST = 0.3,0.5,1.0, respectively. For light DM mass mS < mt, however, perturbative [formula] can easily evade the constraints from the current gamma-ray observation.

Collider Search

Since the top partner T carries the color charge, pp  →  T can have sizable production cross section at the LHC. The T pair will decay 100% into [formula] signal when kinematically open which will receive constraints from the CMS [formula] measurements at 8 TeV [\cite=Khachatryan2015]. We use FeynRules [\cite=Alloul2014] to implement this top-philic model into MadGraph5 [\cite=Alwall2014] to generate the parton level events, followed by PYTHIA6 [\cite=Sjostrand2006] to perform the parton shower. Then we use CheckMate [\cite=Kim2015] [\cite=Drees2013], which has encoded Delphes [\cite=Ovyn2009] [\cite=DeFavereau2014] to simulate the collider response, to implement the CMS [formula] measurement [\cite=Khachatryan2015] and obtain the cut efficiency ε. Then the number of signal events can be calculated as [formula] where L = 19.7  fb -  1 is the integrated luminosity at 8 TeV used in [\cite=Khachatryan2015] and σ is the leading order (LO) production cross section of pp  →  T at 8 TeV calculated by MadGraph5. Here we also consider the K-factor for t production at next-to-next-to-LO (NNLO), which is analogous to the QCD production of T and has a value of K = 1.6 [\cite=Kidonakis:2010dk]. As for the 1σ uncertainty of σ(pp  →  T) which needs to be provided for CheckMate to calculate the total uncertainty of Nsig and the exclusion limit based on the CLs prescription [\cite=0954-3899-28-10-313], we set it to be 16% which is the one quoted in the ATLAS degenerate stop study at NLO [\cite=Aad:2014nra].

We first validate our simulation by reproducing the various results based on the following effective field theory (EFT) considered in the CMS report [\cite=Khachatryan2015].

[formula]

where χ is a Dirac fermionic DM and M* is the interaction scale. There is only one Signal Region (SR) considered in the report which has the following cuts of the kinematic observables

[formula]

In the above cuts, transverse mass MT is defined as [formula] where [formula] is the transverse momentum of the required single lepton and Δφ is the opening azimuth angle between the lepton and [formula] vector. [formula] is the opening azimuth angle between the leading (next-to-leading) jet and [formula] vector. As for the definition of MWT2 variable we refer the reader to [\cite=Khachatryan2015] where more details are given.

Our validation of cut efficiencies ε for different mχ are shown in Table.[\ref=table-Validation] where CMS results are taken from Table.3 of [\cite=Khachatryan2015] and M*=100 GeV. One can see that our cut efficiencies agree well with those given in the CMS report for all of the seven benchmark points covering mχ from 1 GeV to 1 TeV. Moreover, in fig.[\ref=fig:validation-1] (fig.[\ref=fig:validation-600]) we also checked the individual distribution of the four kinematic variables [formula], MT, MWT2 and [formula] in eq.([\ref=eq:collider-cms-cuts]) when the other three are applied for mχ=1 (600) GeV, where the CMS results are taken from fig.3 of [\cite=Khachatryan2015]. Again, our results are in good agreement with the experimental report.

In fig.[\ref=fig:sstt_r] we show the rCM value calculated by CheckMate which is defined as rCM = Nsig / Nobs and can be used to claim the exclusion at 95% C.L. when rCM > 1. The black line in the figure indicates rCM = 1. We found that the CMS [formula] measurement can exclude moderate mT between 300 (450)-850 GeV for mS =0 (200) GeV, and the region with mS < 100 GeV and 400 < mT < 550 GeV receives the strongest constraints. Although this 8 TeV search loses sensitivity for heavy [formula] GeV for this top-philic DM model, we expect that the ongoing LHC Run-2 will extend this boundary.

Constraints on the Model

Finally we combine the results from thermal relic density, direct detection, indirect detection and collider search in fig.[\ref=fig:combine], where we choose yST = 0.5,1.0 given their perturbativity and possibility of detection indicated from both fig.[\ref=fig:DD] and fig.[\ref=fig:ID]. The black solid lines include the topVL and CSSgg contribution to obtain ΩDMh2 = 0.12. The magenta, orange regions correspond to the excluded parameter space by CMS [formula] search and Fermi dwarf results 〈σv〉gg, while light yellow and green (cyan) regions correspond to the 10 times improved 〈σv〉gg and future XENON-1T (LUX-ZP) experiments. One can clearly see the complementarity between direct and indirect detection in the light and heavy DM mass range, while the collider search result is independent of yST since the top partner T has only one decay channel. Although the current LUX results and Fermi observation cannot put constraints on these perturbative yST, a large portion of the parameter space will be covered by both the future direct and indirect experiments.

Conclusion

In this work we studied a scalar top-philic DM S coupling, apart from the Higgs portal, exclusively to the right-handed top quark tR and a colored vector-like top partner T with Yukawa coupling yST which we call the topVL portal. When the Higgs portal is closed and yST is perturbative [formula], TS  →  (W+b,gt), SS  →  t and T  →  (q,gg) provide the dominant contributions to obtain ΩDMh2≃0.12 in light, medium and heavy DM mass range, respectively. However, large yST  ~  O(10) can make SS  →  gg dominate via the loop-induced coupling CSSgg in the mS < mt region.

Due to the absence of valence top quark in the nucleon, in this model it is the CSSgg coupling that generates DM-nucleon scattering which can be large when SS  →  gg dominates the DM annihilation. We found that the the current LUX results can exclude the SS  →  gg dominating scenario. The expected sensitivity of XENON-1T may further test [formula], and [formula] may be covered in the future LUX-ZP experiment.

The indirect detection can play a complementary role in this model. The current results from Fermi gamma-ray observations on both continuous spectrum from dwarf galaxies and line spectrum from Galactic center can also exclude the SS  →  gg dominating scenario , and are just about to test the heavy DM mass region mS > mt. One order of magnitude of sensitivity improvement can push DM mass to be heavier than about 400, 600, 1000 GeV for yST = 0.3,0.5,1.0, respectively.

The colored top partner T can be produced in pair at the hadron colliders such as LHC. They will decay 100% into [formula] signal when kinematically open and receive constraints from the corresponding CMS measurements at 8 TeV. We found that mT can be excluded between 300 (450)-850 GeV for mS =0 (200) GeV. Although the 8 TeV CMS search loses its sensitivity for [formula] GeV, we expect the ongoing LHC Run-2 to extend this boundary in future.
