Two Dimensional Classification of the Swift/BAT GRBs

Introduction

The mystery of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) classification has puzzled astronomers since 1990s. [\cite=kouveliotou] firstly discovered the bimodal distribution of log T90 and proposed the duration classification criterion, that is long GRBs with T90 > 2s and short GRBs with T90 < 2s, This classification method has been widely accepted by many authors so far. The two kinds of GRBs are thought to have different physical origins. Short GRBs are believed to be the product of merging of binary systems, like two neutron stars (NS-NS) or a system of neutron star and black hole (NS-BH) [\citep=nakar] [\citep=zhangbing2009] [\citep=gehrels09]. LGRBs have close relationship with the collapse of massive stars that has been mostly confirmed by observations [\citep=woosley]. However, [\cite=horvath1998] analysed the log T90 distribution of BATSE 3B catalogue including 797 GRBs and found a possible existence of one more class. The phenomenal evidence was also found in the datasets of BeppoSAX [\citep=horvath2009], Swift/BAT [\citep=horvath2008], Fermi/GBM [\citep=tarno2015aa] etc.

Besides the observed duration distribution, several authors also did similar studies of the distribution in the rest frame. [\cite=zhangzb2008] analysed the duration distribution of 95 redshift-known Swift GRBs and found that the intrinsic duration is still bimodal. [\cite=zitouni] found that 3 groups were statistically better that 2 groups after studying the intrinsic duration distribution of a larger datasets redshift-known Swift GRBs, which contains 248 GRBs. [\cite=tarno2016na] analysed the distribution of 947 Swift GRBs' observed duration and 347 redshift-known GRBs' duration in both observer and rest frames. It is found that 3 groups are statistically better than 2 groups in the observer frame (see also [\citealt=tarno2016mn]). In the rest frame, 2 groups are good enough for the 347 redshift-known GRBs. Recently, [\cite=horvath2016] studied the duration distribution of 888 Swift GRBs observed before October 2015. They found that three log-normal function is better to fit the duration distribution than two log-normal function, with a 99.9999% significance level. Their results showed that the relative frequencies were 8%, 35% and 57% for short, intermediate and long bursts, respectively (see also [\citealt=horvath2008]). They further claimed that no significant differences of the redshift distribution were found between the intermediate GRBs and the long ones. However, the existence of this third class is still controversial so far.

Considering this, durations-based classification of GRBs might not be an only standard. [\cite=zhangbing2011] proposed that more observational properties, namely redshift, fluence, flux, Epeak of the υfυ spectrum and etc., should be taken into account together. Meanwhile, SGRBs usually have harder spectra than LGRBs [\citep=kouveliotou] [\citep=zhangzb2008], the clustering phenomenon in the plane of duration versus harness ratio (T90 vs HR) should also be useful to classify the GRBs. [\cite=horvath2006] [\cite=horvath2010] did clustering analysis of T90 vs HR diagram for BATSE and Swift datasets, respectively. They found the possible existence of the third class. It is worth noting that the above studies are carried out based on the observations only that may involve the selection effect or bias. In addition, different methods applied for the same sample may reach controversial judgement of GRB classes. To avoid all the above influences, we apply Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Expectation Maximization (EM) Algorithm to the density estimation of T90 vs HR diagram for the redshift-known Swift GRBs in both the observer frame and the rest frame. Note that the sample in this work only comprise of those Swift/BAT GRBs with measured redshift, unlike some previous studies. This paper is organized as follows, Section [\ref=sect2] will give the description of our datasets and analysing method. Our main results will be displayed in Section [\ref=sect3].

Data Preparation and Method

Data Preparation

The current catalog of Swift [\citep=donato2012] contains all GRBs observed by Swift from the beginning of the mission, 20 Nov 2004 to 31 Dec 2012, of which 296 bursts have both T90, redshift, spectral properties (photon index α, fluence and etc.). The observed spectral hardness HR32,obs in our analysis was defined as the fluence ratio between 50 keV~  100 keV and 25 keV~  50 keV and it can be calculated by the fluence properties listed in the catalog. To calculate the intrinsic spectral hardness HR32,int, we use the best fitted spectral model provided in the Swift official site. In our datasets, there are 261 GRBs following the single power law model (PL) and other 35 GRBs are better to be described with the cutoff power law model (CPL). The PL and CPL forms can be written as

where α are the single power law or the cutoff power law photon index, β is the peak energy, and f(E) represents the photon flux at a given energy. The hardness ratio can be calculated by

[formula]

[formula]

where z is the cosmological redshift. It is well known in the literature that, with single power law spectrum, the hardness ratio remains the same at any redshift. In the real situation, the hardness ratio should depending on redshift[\citep=bagoly]. The spectrum in the rest frame may has got a more complicated form. Considering this, our calculation of hardness ratio in the rest frame, especially for the 261 PL bursts, is simply an approximation of the real value. We also calculate the HR32,obs by always using the best fitted spectral model and compare it with that in the catalog in Fig. [\ref=hr32_comp]. One can find that some points are obviously deviate from the red solid equality line. Considering this, we check the 35 GRBs that follow CPL model and compare the calculated HR32,obs under both PL model and CPL model with the values in catalog. We compare the two models in Fig. [\ref=cpl_comp], in which the PL form seems more consistent with observations than the CPL one. In order to diagnose if the different model can change the classification based on the T90 distributions, we will do a comparative study with the following method.

Analysis Method

We used the GMM and EM algorithm to estimate the density of Swift bursts with known redshift in the T90 - HR32 plane. The GMM is a parametric probabilistic function representing a weighted sum of Gaussian components. For the two-dimensional case, the likelihood will be

[formula]

where [formula] is the dataset, ωi is weight of the ith Gaussian component, [formula] and [formula] are the mean vector and the covariance matrix correspondingly. [formula] is the density of the ith Gaussian component that can be calculated by

[formula]

The best parameters of an input model can be gained by using the EM algorithm, which will maximize [formula]. In our analysis, [formula] contains two numbers with the order of (log T90, log HR32). The GMM will assign a sample to the Gaussian component with the highest probability.

Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) [\citep=bic] [\citep=liddle2007] were usually used to determine the number of Gaussian components. The BIC value is defined as

[formula]

where p is the number of parameters, Pmax is the maximum likelihood. The BIC will choose the model when Eq. [\ref=eq_bic] reaches the minimum BICmin.

[formula]

For other candidate models, if 0 < Δ < 2, they are also supported. If 2 < Δ < 6, they are weakly supported. But if Δ > 6, these models are will not be reliable any more [\citep=burnham2004].

All our analyses are performed under scikit-learn [\citep=sklearn], a Python Machine Learning package. The histogram figures were plotted following Knuth bin rule [\citep=knuth] with the implement in astropy.

Results

Using the GMM method, we estimated the log T90 vs log HR32 density distribution of 296 redshift-known Swift GRBs in both observer and rest frames. Our results are displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig_obs_plcpl] and [\ref=fig_rest_plcpl] under the mixed spectrum model(marked as "PL+CPL" in the figures), Fig. [\ref=fig_obs_pl] and [\ref=fig_rest_pl] under PL only(marked as "PL Only" in the figures). The optimized parameters of different models are listed in Table [\ref=tab:gmm_tab_plcpl] and Table [\ref=tab:gmm_tab_pl], respectively.

In the observer frame, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig_obs_plcpl], the minimum BIC value obtained with the mixed spectrum model for 2 Gaussian components(2-G) model is ~  223, about 6.5 smaller than ~  229 for 3 Gaussian components(3-G) model(see Table [\ref=tab:gmm_tab_plcpl]). This indicates that 2 components are better enough to describe the two dimensional distribution of T90,obs  ~  HR32,obs in the observer frame. Similar results can also be obtained under the calculation by using PL only in Fig. [\ref=fig_obs_pl] and Table [\ref=tab:gmm_tab_pl], where minimum BIC value for 2-G is ~   189, about 7.7 smaller than ~  197 for 3-G.

In the rest frame, the intrinsic duration T90,int can be calculated by [formula]. The intrinsic HR32,int is calculated with the Eq. [\ref=hr_res]. Once again, we find that the BIC prefers the 2-G model instead of the 3-G model. As shown in Fig. [\ref=fig_rest_plcpl], and Table [\ref=tab:gmm_tab_pl], by mixture spectral model, the minimum BIC value for 2-G is about 3.4 smaller than 3-G's BIC. For calculation using PL only, the minimum BIC value 3-G is about 22 larger than 2-G's BIC. Simultaneously, T90,int of the two components move to the smaller value, systematically, as listed in Table [\ref=tab:gmm_tab_plcpl] and [\ref=tab:gmm_tab_pl].

Fig. [\ref=bic_plcpl] and [\ref=bic_pl] show our BIC evaluation of different models in both observer and rest frames under two calculation condition. One can find that two instead of three or more Gaussian components are favoured in both the observer and rest frames.

Our work shows that 2-G model is better than 3-G model in the observer and rest frames, which is inconsistent with some previous results (e.g. [\citealt=horvath2010]). For the 3-G model in the observer frame, our analysis returns relative ratios 0.026, 0.508 and 0.466 (PL+CPL) or 0.026, 0.516 and 0.458 (PL only), which are significantly different from 0.079, 0.296 and 0.626 gotten by [\cite=horvath2010] (see also [\citealt=koen]). Considering the datasets with redshift-known Swift GRBs only, the above difference is due to the small fraction of short GRBs in our sample, which makes short GRBs with redshift not statistically significant as a single group possibly. This will be confirmed by a larger population of short GRBs with measured redshift in the future.

[\cite=veres] also studied the Swift/BAT GRBs and found they favour 3-component model. They argue that the third component is closely related to X-ray Flashes(XRFs). For the mixed spectrum model in Fig. [\ref=bic_plcpl], the 3-G model under the calculation by using mixed spectrum model is weakly supported in the rest frame and the third component indeed have the softest spectra (see Fig. [\ref=fig_rest_plcpl]). This may indicate that the connection between the third component and the XRFs might be true.Based on the above analysis in the two dimensional case, one can conclude that the Swift bursts with measured redshift are still better to be classified into two groups, which is in good agreement with some previous works (e.g. [\citealt=zhangzb2008] [\citealt=qin2013] [\citealt=tarno2015aa] [\citealt=yangeb])

The results of this work can be summarized as.

Swift GRBs are better to describe with two groups other than three in either the observer or the rest frame.

This classification criterion is not affected by the spectral form too much.

The third class weakly supported in the rest frame may correspond to the softest spectra of the XRFs.

More reshift-known GRBs are needed to do this kind of research.
