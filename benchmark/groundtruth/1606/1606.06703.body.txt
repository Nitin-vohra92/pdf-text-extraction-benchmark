On the fourth moment of Hecke Maass forms and the Random Wave Conjecture

Introduction

A central question in Arithmetic Quantum Chaos concerns the distribution of the Hecke Maass forms for the full modular group. The Random Wave Conjecture (RWC) predicts that for large Laplacian eigenvalue, the distribution is close to random. That is, the moments of Hecke Maass cusp forms of large Laplacian eigenvalue equal the moments of a random variable with Gaussian distribution. Until now only numerical work (see [\cite=hejrac]) has supported this conjecture. On the theoretical side, the fourth moment in particular is a natural and important case to study as it is reduces, via Watson's formula, to a problem on L-functions. Sarnak and Watson have announced (though a proof has not yet appeared) a close to optimal upper bound for the fourth moment, possibly conditional on the Ramanujan Conjecture (see [\cite=sar]). But of course, to support the Random Wave Conjecture, a precise asymptotic is essential.

Proving an asymptotic for the fourth moment of Hecke Maass forms seems to be beyond the reach of current technology. The goal of this paper is to establish this asymptotic on the assumption of the Generalized Lindelöf Hypothesis (GLH). One may wonder what the benefit is of proving one conjecture based on another. One answer is that these conjectures are unrelated. Another answer is of course that the GLH is a much more well accepted conjecture in mathematics and its truth is very firmly believed. This puts the RWC on more solid ground. We start with a very informal introduction to Quantum Chaos.

Arithmetic Quantum Chaos and the Random Wave Conjecture

The general objective of Quantum Chaos is to investigate the relationship between quantum mechanics and classical chaos. There must be a relationship as all of classical physics is supposed to be explained by quantum mechanics (the correspondence principle). Thus we first recall that chaos is a term used to describe the behavior of a dynamical system that is highly sensitive to initial conditions. For example, the dynamics of frictionless billiards on a table in the shape of a rectangle capped by semicircles at the ends (a Bunimovich stadium) are chaotic. The paths of two point particles (billiard balls) that are initially positioned very slightly apart from each other and hit with almost identical velocities will (generally) diverge exponentially from each other. The trajectory of each ball will (generally) not be periodic and will eventually fill out the entire stadium in an even manner. Here the word 'generally' is used because there are some periodic paths such as the 'bouncing ball trajectory', where the ball bounces up and down forever between the two straight edges of the stadium. The situation is in contrast to billiards on a rectangular table, where the two balls would follow paths that diverge at most linearly (so that the dynamics are not chaotic).

Quantum Chaos is the study of quantum mechanical systems whose underlying classical dynamics are chaotic. For example, consider the quantum mechanical description of billiards on the Bunimovich stadium. Here a wave takes the place of the billiard ball. The wave is a solution, trapped inside the stadium (a potential well), of the time-independent Schrödinger equation with boundary conditions (an eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian). Thus the wave is an eigenfunction, and the integral of its modulus square over any region represents the probability of finding the eigenfunction in that region. For the Bunimovich stadium, it turns out that for large eigenvalue (high energy), the wave is equally likely be be anywhere in the stadium except for some cluster (called 'scarring') around lines corresponding to paths such as the bouncing ball.

In Quantum Chaos, one is interested in the statistical properties of the eigenfunctions with large eigenvalue associated to the quantum system. One problem in Quantum Chaos is to study the distribution of the eigenfunctions (of large eigenvalue) over the total region. This is important because by knowing the distribution, one can know the value of the modulus square of the eigenfunction and hence one can know the probability of locating the eigenfunction anywhere. Another problem in Quantum Chaos is the study of the spacings between eigenvalues.

This paper is motivated by Arithmetic Quantum Chaos, which refers to quantum systems that have arithmetic structure. For example, let [formula] denote the upper half complex plane and let [formula]. The modular curve [formula] is a hyperbolic manifold with finite volume. It turns out that billiards (called Artin billiards) on the modular curve are chaotic (the geodesic motion is ergodic). To study the corresponding quantum system, we consider the (square integrable) solutions to the eigenvalue problem for the Laplace-Beltrami operator. The special fact about the modular curve is that it is equipped with an additional infinite family of operators, called Hecke operators, that are arithmetic in nature and commute with the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Since the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator is conjectured to be simple, any eigenfunction of the Laplace-Beltrami operator is expected to also be an eigenfunction of all the Hecke operators. But as this remains a conjecture, Arithmetic Quantum Chaos explicitly restricts study to simultaneous eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and the Hecke operators - these are called Hecke Maass cusp forms.

Although the arithmetic setting described above is very special, the advantage is that one is armed with the rich tools of number theory (L-functions, automorphic forms, trace formulas) and has an opportunity to shed light on some very deep problems in Quantum Chaos. Historically, the classical dynamics of the modular curve was one of the first rigorous demonstrations of chaos (coming well before the Bunimovich stadium). See [\cite=art]. On the quantum side, Peter Sarnak made a case for studying Arithmetic Quantum Chaos in [\cite=sar1]. He wrote, "With time as more is established about the spectra of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds we hope that they become central models for Quantum Chaos". Part of this prediction has already come true, with the awarding of a Fields Medal in this area as described below.

Number theorists are interested in the distribution (one of the two important types of problems in Quantum Chaos mentioned above) of Hecke Maass cusp forms. A conjecture made by Berry [\cite=ber] and Hejhal and Rackner [\cite=hejrac] says that a Hecke Maass cusp form of large Laplacian eigenvalue should behave like a random wave. That is, its distribution should be the Gaussian (or normal) distribution. Equivalently, the moments of a Hecke Maass cusp form (after suitable normalization) should equal the moments of a Gaussian random variable, in the large Laplacian eigenvalue limit. An interesting consequence of this is that a Hecke Maass cusp form of large Laplacian eigenvalue should have uniformly distributed mass on the modular curve (the wave should be equally likely to be present anywhere). This last property is known as the Quantum Unique Ergodicity (QUE), and was recently proven to be true by Lindenstrauss [\cite=lin] and Soundararajan [\cite=sou]. The fact that Lindenstrauss won a Fields Medal in 2010 for his achievement shows the profound importance of this topic of research in the mathematical community. The QUE property is reminiscent of a trajectory from classical chaos that evenly spreads out everywhere.

The conjecture above (which can be made in greater generality) is known as the Random Wave Conjecture. It was tested numerically in [\cite=hejrac] and [\cite=hejstr] but theoretically it remains unproven. The formulation of this conjecture in terms of moments means that mathematicians are very much interested in the moments of Hecke Maass cusp forms. The second moment is usually normalized to equal some constant (see ([\ref=probmeas]) below). Watson [\cite=wat] showed that the third moment of a Hecke Maass cusp form is asymptotically zero, along any sequence of Hecke Maass cusp forms with Laplacian eigenvalue tending to infinity. This is consistent with the RWC since the third moment of a random variable with Gaussian distribution is 0. The natural task is to then consider the fourth moment (or equivalently the fourth power of the L4-norm) of Hecke Maass cusp forms. For this, very little is known. It is an open problem to obtain an asymptotic for the fourth moment and show that it equals the fourth moment of a Gaussian random variable.

The fourth moment

Clearly the problem of finding an asymptotic for the fourth moment of Hecke Maass cusp forms is an outstanding one, as it would shed light on the RWC. We prove

Assume the GLH. Let f be an even or odd Hecke-Maass cusp form for Γ with Laplacian eigenvalue [formula], where T > 0. Let f be normalized to have probability measure equal to 1, as follows:

[formula]

There exists a constant δ > 0 such that

[formula]

as T  →    ∞  .

Thus our result confirms on GLH the prediction of the RWC, with a power saving. Note that f is real because it is assumed to be even or odd. The left hand side of ([\ref=rwc]) will be studied by first using Watson's formula to relate it to a mean value of L-functions. If the GLH were applied at this point, it would immediately yield the upper bound O(Tε). To go beyond this and obtain an asymptotic with power saving, even on GLH, requires a lot of work and the full power of spectral theory. Our proof will show that if not GLH, then at the very least what is required is a subconvexity bound for the L-function associated to the Rankin-Selberg product of an (essentially) fixed Hecke cusp form and the symmetric square L-function of f, in the eigenvalue aspect of f. See the discussion following Lemma [\ref=wlem] and the last sentence of this paper. This GL(2)×  GL(3) subconvexity problem seems to be very difficult and, interestingly, is also essentially what is required to get a power saving error in the QUE problem. So our problem is at least as hard as the quantitative QUE problem.

Let {uj:j  ≥  1} denote an orthonormal basis of even and odd Hecke Maass cusp forms for Γ, ordered by Laplacian eigenvalue [formula], where tj > 1. Let L(s,uj) be the L-function attached to uj, normalized so that its functional equation relates values at s and 1 - s. The shape of the mean value of L-functions that we will need to evaluate is essentially

[formula]

The analytic conductors of [formula] and [formula] are t2j and t2j(1 + |4T2 - t2j|)2 respectively. Thus the denominator above is about the same size as the convexity bound for the numerator. In the "bulk" range T1 - ε < tj  <  2T - T1 - ε, which is nearly a dyadic interval, the analytic conductor of the triple product L-function [formula] is about T8, while the sum is over about T2 forms. Thus the "log of conductor to log of family size ratio" is 4. Our main work will be on treating this bulk range. The remaining ranges will handled immediately on the GLH.

A similar mean value of triple product L-functions was considered (unconditionally) by Li in [\cite=li-x], but there the GL(3) form was fixed, while here it is not (T tends to infinity). Thus our problem is clearly more complex. A similar mean value was also considered by Buttcane and Khan in [\cite=butkha], with [formula] replaced by [formula], where χ is a quadratic character. Such a factorization occurs when f is a dihedral form and this was the motivation for the work in [\cite=butkha], although in that paper we were not able to make any direct conclusions about the fourth moment. In this paper we use the methods of [\cite=butkha] together with GL(3) Voronoi summation as a new ingredient to treat the present case where [formula] does not factorize. The present analysis is more delicate, with the ranges of various parameters harder to control (in the same way that many problems in number theory involving the divisor function become more difficult when the divisor function is replaced by Fourier coefficients of cusp forms). It is for this reason that it is not clear a priori that our previous methods would work for this problem. Some care is also needed to avoid reliance on the Ramanujan Conjecture (both at the finite and infinite places).

Finally we remark that the problem of obtaining an asymptotic for the fourth moment of holomorphic cusp forms of large weight seems to be much harder. This is because the corresponding mean value of L-functions has a larger log of conductor to log of family size ratio. Indeed the best known upper bound for the fourth moment in this case is far from optimal; see [\cite=blokhayou].

Reduction to L-functions

Convention. Throughout, ε will denote an arbitrarily small positive constant, which may not be the same from one occurrence to another.

To prove Theorem [\ref=main], the starting point is to express the fourth moment as a mean value of L-functions. Note that since [formula] and [formula], we need to show that with the normalization [formula], where the inner product is the Petersson inner product, we have

[formula]

By the spectral theorem (see [\cite=iwakow]) and Parseval's theorem, we have

[formula]

where E(z,s) is the standard Eisenstein series. By normalization of f, we have

[formula]

and we will show that

Let f be as in Theorem [\ref=main]. On the GLH, we have

[formula]

Thus it remains to prove

Let f be as in Theorem [\ref=main]. On the GLH, there exists some δ > 0 such that

[formula]

Since [formula] has L2-norm equal to 1, applying Watson's formula [\cite=wat] (see also [\cite=blokhayou]) to the inner product of [formula] and uj, we get

[formula]

where the L-functions appearing above are defined in the next section and

[formula]

Equivalently, as uj is real,

[formula]

For the weight function H(tj), we have by Stirling's approximation (see ([\ref=stirs]) or [\cite=spi]) that

[formula]

where

[formula]

Thus the right hand side of ([\ref=wats]) looks essentially like ([\ref=shape]).

Preliminaries

Stirling's approximation

For σ > 0 fixed, as a first order approximation we have

[formula]

where sgn(γ) is 1 if γ is positive and - 1 if γ is negative. As |γ|  →    ∞  , this gives

[formula]

Approximate functional equations

Let λj(n) and λf(n) denote the (real) eigenvalues of the n-th Hecke operator corresponding to uj and f respectively, where we write λj( - n) = λj(n) for uj even and λj( - n) =  - λj(n) for uj odd. The L-function associated to uj is given by

[formula]

for [formula]. Let Af(n,1) = Af(1,n) be given by

[formula]

The right hand above equals L(s,sym2f) for [formula]. Now define Af(n,m) = Af(m,n) by the Hecke relations

[formula]

With this, we can define

[formula]

for [formula].

Kim and Sarnak [\cite=kimsar] have proven the following bounds towards the Ramanujan Conjecture:

[formula]

On average, the best possible bounds are known by [\cite=iwa] and [\cite=hofloc]:

[formula]

This implies by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the Hecke relations ([\ref=gl3hecke]) that

[formula]

Let

[formula]

For uj even we have the functional equations

[formula]

For uj odd we have the functional equation

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. All of these may be found in [\cite=gol] and [\cite=li-x].

We now set up approximate functional equations for the central values. But first we explain what we will need. Usually one takes an approximate functional equation with the shortest possible Dirichlet series. For uj even, this means taking

[formula]

and for uj odd, we could take

[formula]

which vanishes. Since λj( - n) = λj(n) for uj even and λj( - n) =  - λj(n) for uj odd, in both cases we have

[formula]

As we will see below, to understand a mean value of the form [formula] using Kuznetsov's formula, the same sign Kuznetsov (the +   sign) leads to a J-Bessel transform while the opposite sign Kuznetsov (the -   sign) leads to a K-Bessel transform. Both transforms can be evaluated asymptotically and it turns out the main term of the K-Bessel transform has no oscillation. We find this easier to work with, so we reduce the analysis involving the same sign terms by taking an approximate functional equation with two Dirichlet series of unequal length as follows:

[formula]

In this way, the Dirichlet series leading to the same sign terms is shorter. We now state this precisely.

For uj even, we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

for any σ > 0.

Let [formula] be some fixed constants to be determined later. For uj even or odd, and T1 - α < |tj| < T1 + ε, we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

for any σ > 0.

This follows from [\cite=iwakow] and the functional equations given above. For ([\ref=afe1]) and ([\ref=afe2]), take G(u) = eu2 and X = 1 in that theorem. For ([\ref=trickafe]), take G(u) = eu2 and X = Tβ to get

[formula]

where κj = 0 or 1 as uj is even or odd. By the rapid decay of es2 in vertical lines, we may restrict the integral above to [formula]. By Stirling's approximation, for [formula] fixed, [formula] and |t| > T1 - α, we have

[formula]

Thus up to a small error, the ratio of Gamma functions in ([\ref=uba]) does not depend on κj. Also note that the sum in ([\ref=uba]) can be restricted to n < T1 + β  +  ε up to admissible error by Stirling's approximation. Thus ([\ref=trickafe]) follows, using ([\ref=avgram]).

Consider those values of |t| that are roughly of size 2T but not too close to 2T. That is, suppose that for some [formula] to be fixed later, we have

[formula]

In the integrals appearing in Lemma [\ref=afelem], write s = σ + iγ. By the rapid decay of es2 in vertical lines, we may restrict these integrals to |γ| < Tε. We have by Stirling's approximation that

[formula]

and

[formula]

for any N  ≥  1 and some Bn(σ,γ) and Cn(σ,γ) polynomial in σ and γ. By thinking of |t| and |t(4T2 - t2)| as being of size about T and T3 in the range ([\ref=closerange]), and taking σ as large as we like in the expressions ([\ref=stirv1]-[\ref=stirv2]), we see that the sums in ([\ref=trickafe]) and ([\ref=afe2]) have length about T1  ∓  β and T3 respectively. We have

[formula]

in the range ([\ref=closerange]) by taking N large enough and σ  =  ε. Similarly,

[formula]

for k  ≥  0.

Kuznetsov trace formula

Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

We have

Let h(z) be an even, holomorphic function on [formula] with decay |h(z)|  ≪  (1 + |z|)- 2 - θ on that strip, for some θ > 0. Then for n,m  >  0, we have

[formula]

where δn,m is 1 if n = m and 0 otherwise (thus δ- n,m is always 0) and d*t  =   tanh (πt)  tdt.

See [\cite=moto]. There, the function h(z) must be holomorphic function on [formula]. The relaxation of this condition to [formula] is due to Yoshida [\cite=yos]. We need this version because H(t), which was defined in section [\ref=redsec], has a pole at [formula].

For the Kuznetsov trace formula, we will need to asymptotically evaluate some Bessel transforms. The following lemmas, taken from [\cite=butkha], are analogous to the averages of real Bessel functions given in [\cite=ils]:

[formula]

Let [formula]. For any x > 0 and any smooth even function h, compactly supported on [formula] with derivatives satisfying [formula], we have

[formula]

The main term is O(T- 100) if x < T2 - 3α.

Let [formula]. For any x > 0 and any smooth even function h, compactly supported on [formula] with derivatives satisfying [formula], we have

[formula]

where [formula].

Kuznetsov's formula for sums of Kloosterman sums

Let Φ be a smooth function compactly supported on the positive reals.

Let

[formula]

For q  ≥  1 and k  ≥  2, let Bk(q) denote an orthonormal basis of weight k holomorphic cusp forms for Γ0(q). For each element g in this basis, let [formula] denote the n-th Fourier coefficient of g. Let B0(q) denote an orthonormal basis of Maass cusp forms for Γ0(q). For each element g in this basis, let ρg(n) denote the n-th Fourier coefficient of g, and let [formula] denote its Laplacian eigenvalue. By a result of Kim and Sarnak [\cite=kimsar] towards Selberg's Eigenvalue Conjecture, we have that

[formula]

Let [formula] denote the n-th Fourier coefficient of the Eisenstein series [formula] at the cusp [formula] of Γ0(q).

[\cite=iwakow] Keep the notation above and let q  ≥  1. For positive integers n and m, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

We now record some properties of the transforms of Φ given above, based on the situation we will be in ([\ref=supppsi]).

Suppose that Φ(w) is supported on

[formula]

for some T-  ε  <  X  <  T10 and satisfies

[formula]

for some T- 10 < Y  <  T10.

Case 1. If [formula] and k  ≥  2 then

[formula]

Unless

[formula]

we have

[formula]

for any B > 0.

Case 2: If [formula], then

[formula]

We demonstrate the claims for [formula] only, the other cases being similar. Suppose first that [formula]. Note the bound

[formula]

which follows for 0 < w < 1 from the power series [\cite=gr]

[formula]

and for w  ≥  1 by [\cite=blomil]. By ([\ref=psisupp]), we may restrict the integral in the definition of [formula] to T- 11  <  w  <  Tε / 3 and then apply ([\ref=psicond1]) with k = 0 and ([\ref=jbound]) to get

[formula]

This proves ([\ref=psibound]). Now suppose that |t| > Tε. By the power series ([\ref=jpow]), we have

[formula]

Integrating by parts k times, we get

[formula]

By Stirling's approximation, we have for |t| > Tε and 0 < w < Tε / 3 that

[formula]

By ([\ref=psisupp]) we have that

[formula]

for any k  ≥  0. Using these bounds in ([\ref=serie]) and taking k large, we see that |(t)|  ≪  |t|- B for any B > 0 unless |t| < XTε.

Now suppose [formula]. By [\cite=blomil] and ([\ref=jpow]) we have that

[formula]

for w in the interval ([\ref=psisupp]). This gives ([\ref=psibound2]) by the same argument as above for ([\ref=psibound]).

Orthonormal basis of newforms

The right hand side of Lemma [\ref=kuzback] involves sums over orthonormal bases of cusp forms. We will need these basis elements to be linear combinations of lifts of newforms. Let Sk(q) denote for k  ≥  2 the space of holomorphic cusp forms of weight k  ≥  2 and level q, and for k = 0 the space of Maass cusp forms of level q. For d|q, let B*k(d) denote a basis for the space of newforms of Sk(d), which is orthonormal with respect to the Petersson inner product on Sk(q). For h∈Sk(d) and [formula], let

[formula]

There exists an orthonormal basis for Sk(q) of the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

for some numbers κf(c,b)  ≪  qε.

Coefficients κf(c,b) that give such a basis were first determined in [\cite=ils] for square-free q and in [\cite=rou] for q a prime power. By the same methods, if [formula] and [formula] are the prime factorizations of c and b (so that only finitely many of the exponents kp and lp are nonzero), then we can take

[formula]

where κf(pkp,plp) are given in [\cite=rou], and κ(1,1) = 1. We have [formula] on using any nontrivial bound towards the Ramanujan Conjecture. As there are at most log q prime factors of q, this gives κf(c,b)  ≪  qε.

Voronoi summation

The GL(3) Voronoi summation formula was proven by Miller and Schmid [\cite=milsch]. Later, Goldfeld and Li [\cite=golli] gave another proof and we follow their presentation.

Let ψ be a smooth, compactly supported function on the positive real numbers. Let (b,c) = 1 and let [formula] denote the multiplicative inverse of b modulo c. We have

[formula]

where σ > 0, ψ̃ denotes the Mellin transform of ψ and

[formula]

Suppose that [formula]. By integration by parts we can see that ψ̃(1 - s)  ≪  (Tε)N(1 + |s|)- N for any N  ≥  1. By Stirling's approximation, we have

[formula]

Thus we may restrict the integral in ([\ref=vorstate]) to [formula]. In this range, taking σ  =  ε, we get the bound

[formula]

Moving the line of integration in ([\ref=vorstate]) far to the right, we see that the sum on the right hand side of ([\ref=vorstate]) may be restricted to

[formula]

up to an error of O(T- 100). We also observe that in the range [formula], writing s = σ + iγ, Stirling's approximation gives

[formula]

for any N  ≥  1 and some Bn(σ,γ) and Cn(σ,γ) polynomial in σ and γ.

Proof of Lemma [\ref=eislem].

Let

[formula]

denote the Fourier series expansion of f, where

[formula]

By unfolding, we have for [formula],

[formula]

We have that

[formula]

by [\cite=gol],

[formula]

by [\cite=gr], and

[formula]

Thus taking [formula] by analytic continuation, we have

[formula]

This may be compared with ([\ref=wats]).

By ([\ref=stirht]), we may restrict the integral in Lemma [\ref=eislem] to |t| < T1 + ε. The zeta and L-value in the denominator of ([\ref=unfold]) are on the edge of the region of absolute convergence, so they are bounded below by T-  ε. Thus

[formula]

On the GLH, this is bounded by

[formula]

Proof of Proposition [\ref=prop]: Applying the trace formula

We first refine what needs to be proved for Proposition [\ref=prop]. We can immediately treat the contribution to ([\ref=remains]) of tj close to zero and close to 2T. Let [formula] be a fixed constant to be determined later. On the GLH, we have by ([\ref=wats]) and ([\ref=stirht]) that

[formula]

By Weyl's law (see [\cite=iwakow]) we have that this is less than [formula]. Thus we may restrict the left hand side of ([\ref=remains]) to values of tj that are roughly of size 2T, but not too close to 2T. We have to take care when making this restriction because we must use functions that will satisfy the conditions of Kuznetsov's trace formula.

Let [formula] be a fixed constant to be determined later and define the even function

[formula]

where ⌈x⌉ denotes the least integer greater than or equal to x. We have that H(t)W(t)  ≪  T- 100 unless

[formula]

in which range

[formula]

for k  ≥  0. In the range [formula], we have that W(t) = 1 + O(T- 100).

Suppose that |t|  ≤  T1 - α. Then

[formula]

and trivially,

[formula]

Therefore H(t)W(t)  ≪  W(t)  ≪  T- 100 for |t|  ≤  T1 - α. Now suppose |t|  ≥  2T  -  T1 - α. If also |t| > 2T + Tε, then by ([\ref=stirht]) we have H(t)  ≪  T- 100, and so W(t)H(t)  ≪  T- 100. So suppose 2T - T1 - α  ≤  |t|  ≤  2T + Tε. Then

[formula]

and trivially,

[formula]

This proves the first claim.

For the second claim, observe that for x > 0 and N > 0, we have [formula]. So

[formula]

To prove the same sort of bound for H(t), we need more terms in the Stirling expansion ([\ref=stirht]). In the range ([\ref=wrange]), we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

for some constants Bn,Cn,Dn. By taking N large enough we see that if T-  α  ≪  |x|  ≪  1 - T-  α, then

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

in the range ([\ref=wrange]).

For the third claim, suppose that [formula]. Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

Proposition [\ref=prop] is thus reduced to proving

[formula]

for some δ > 0.

We remark that since [formula] and [formula] are non-negative (by the work of [\cite=lapral] and [\cite=lap]), the contribution of the very small eigenvalues is at least

[formula]

Thus even if we were not assuming GLH, a subconvexity bound for [formula] in the T aspect, which is polynomial in |tj| < Tε, would be required, but this is an unsolved and very difficult problem.

By ([\ref=wats]), we have

[formula]

For uj even, we may use the approximate functional equation ([\ref=afe2]) to write

[formula]

But this equality holds for uj odd as well, since in this case both sides vanish. Now we may use the approximate functional equation ([\ref=trickafe]) for [formula], which holds for both even and odd forms. This idea is an important feature of our proof which, as mentioned in the remarks following Lemma [\ref=afelem], will make the analysis more pleasant. Thus we get that the right hand side of ([\ref=watsapplied]) equals

[formula]

By ([\ref=hhbound]) and ([\ref=videf]), the error term is

[formula]

which is [formula] on the GLH. By the approximate functional equation ([\ref=afe2]), the main term of ([\ref=pleas]) equals

[formula]

Applying the Kuznetsov trace formula to the inner sum gives:

[formula]

for some δ > 0, where

[formula]

and

[formula]

By the decay of V±1 and V2 , we may restrict the sum above to n < T1  ∓  β  +  ε and mr2 < T3 + ε. We may also restrict to c  ≤  T3, say, by a standard method (see [\cite=blo] for example). To see this, consider O+ for instance, and move the line of the t-integral from [formula] to [formula]. On the new line, we have by the power series ([\ref=jpow]) that

[formula]

for [formula], as is the case when c > T3. The rest of the integrand satisfies

[formula]

where q(t,T) is given in ([\ref=qtT]). Thus the contribution of the terms with c > T3 is bounded by

[formula]

The last bound uses the average version of the Ramanujan bound given in ([\ref=avgram]) and Weil's bound for the Kloosterman sum. The result is less than a negative power of T.

We will prove that D yields the main term, while E and O± are bounded by a negative power of T.

Proof of Proposition [\ref=prop]: The diagonal

The goal of this section (see ([\ref=prop2]) is to show that

[formula]

for some δ > 0. This was sketched in [\cite=blokhayou] but here we provide the details. By ([\ref=stirv1]-[\ref=stirv2]) and ([\ref=ddef]), we have

[formula]

where [formula] is as in Lemma [\ref=wlem]. By [\cite=gol], we have

[formula]

Thus assuming the GLH, we have that the error term in ([\ref=dexp]) contributes

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=wlem], the weight function H(t)W(t) is O(T- 100) unless T1 - α  <  |t| < 2T  -  T1 - α. By the estimate for H(t) given in [\ref=stirht]), we have

[formula]

and so the error term of ([\ref=dexp]) is [formula].

Consider the main term of ([\ref=dexp]). Moving the line of integration to [formula], we pick up a simple pole at s1 = 0, getting

[formula]

The new error term arises by applying GLH on the shifted line of integration, and it is [formula]. Now moving the line of integration to [formula], and picking up a simple pole at s2 = 0, we get

[formula]

The error term is [formula]. The main term equals

[formula]

We can now restrict the integrand to the range T1 - α  <  t < 2T  -  T1 - α, on which interval tanh (πt)  =  1 + O(T- 100). Further, for [formula] we have W(t)  =  1 + O(T- 100). Thus

[formula]

By ([\ref=stirht]) we have

[formula]

The error term is some negative power of T. This completes the evaluation of the diagonal.

Proof of Proposition [\ref=prop]: The Eisenstein series contribution

In this section we show that E is bounded by a negative power of T. We first rewrite the expression for E using the following approximate functional equations, which are analogous to those in Lemma [\ref=afelem]:

[formula]

We get that

[formula]

By the decay of the weight function H(t)W(t), we may restrict the integral to T1 - α  <  t < 2T  -  T1 - α, and then apply the GLH and the estimate for H(t) given in ([\ref=stirht]) to see that

[formula]

Proof of Proposition [\ref=prop]: The short off-diagonal

The goal of this section is to show that O+ is bounded by a negative power of T. We have seen that for any [formula], we have H(t)W(t)  ≪  T- 100 unless T1 - α < |t| < 2T - T1 - α. Thus in the expression for O+ we may restrict the integral to this range. We may also replace d*t by tdt because tanh t = 1 + O(T- 100) in the given range of t. Thus

[formula]

Let Z be any smooth, even function compactly supported on [formula] with derivatives satisfying

[formula]

Then [formula] is supported on T1 - α < |t| < 2T - T1 - α, on which [formula], and we may use such a function to approximate the characteristic function of this interval. We may absorb W(t) into the function [formula] by property ([\ref=wder]). Writing

[formula]

as in ([\ref=h0def]), we may also absorb [formula] into [formula] by property ([\ref=h0der]). Thus it suffices to prove that for any function Z as above, we have

[formula]

for some δ > 0. We apply Lemma [\ref=jbeslemma] to evaluate the Bessel transform. Note that the function [formula] satisfies the conditions of the lemma by the remarks above and by ([\ref=vder1]-[\ref=vder2]).

The contribution of the main term of Lemma [\ref=jbeslemma] is O(T- 100), unless

[formula]

Since by the decay of V+1(n,t)V2(r2m,t) we may take n < T1 - β  +  ε and m < T3 + ε up to O(T- 100), this imposes

[formula]

We now fix

[formula]

so that the above condition on c is impossible and the main term is O(T- 100). This of course leads to an acceptable bound for O+.

The error term [formula] arising from Lemma [\ref=jbeslemma] contributes

[formula]

By ([\ref=avgram]) and Weil's bound for the Kloosterman sum, this is

[formula]

The innermost c-sum is O(1), so the line above is O(T- 1 + 5α  +  ε), which is admissible as we assume [formula].

Proof of Proposition [\ref=prop]: The long off-diagonal

The goal now is to show that O- is bounded by a negative power of T. This proof is the heart of our paper. As in the previous section, it suffices to prove that for any smooth, even function Z compactly supported on

[formula]

with derivatives satisfying [formula], we have

[formula]

for some δ > 0. We may replace V-1(n,t) and V2(r2m,t) by the main terms in their Stirling expansions ([\ref=stirv1]) and ([\ref=stirv2]) since the lower order terms can be treated similarly. Thus we need to show that

[formula]

is bounded by a negative power of T where

[formula]

for any σ > 0. We apply Lemma [\ref=kbeslemma] to evaluate the Bessel transform in ([\ref=suff]). The error term arising from this result contributes less than a negative power of T, just as in the previous section. There are two similar, non-oscillatory main terms in the asymptotic given by Lemma [\ref=kbeslemma]. It suffices to treat only the leading main term as the other will contribute a factor of T less. Therefore the goal is to bound by a negative power of T the sum

[formula]

Applying a smooth partition of unity, we consider the sum above in dyadic intervals. Let U be a smooth bump function supported on (1,2)  ×  (1,2) and possessing bounded derivatives. It suffices to prove that

[formula]

for some δ > 0, where

[formula]

The bounds on c are enforced by the function Z, and make the condition c  ≤  T3 redundant. It will be apparent from the proof that as long as α is smaller than some fixed constant, there exists some absolute δ > 0 independent of the value of α. For this reason it will be very convenient to rename α to ε and apply the ε-convention. Therefore we have

[formula]

Poisson and Voronoi summation

By separating the n-sum in ([\ref=ready]) into residue classes mod c and applying the Poisson summation formula, we get that the left hand side of ([\ref=ready]) equals

[formula]

Now in this expression, writing [formula], we may replace m by [formula]. Writing [formula], we may replace N by [formula]. Thus ([\ref=pois]) equals

[formula]

where

[formula]

In the integrand above, x and ξ must lie in the interval (1,2) by definition of U, while y must lie in the interval (T-  ε,Tε) by definition of Z. Thus all three variables x,ξ,y should be thought of as roughly constant, and bounded away from zero.

We first observe that we may restrict ([\ref=pois2]) to   ≠  0. First note that the contribution of  = 0 is nil unless c = 1, because [formula] for c > 1. This leaves the case  = 0 and c = 1, whose contribution is

[formula]

where the last equality follows by the Hecke relations ([\ref=gl3hecke]). The sum is trivially O(Tε), using ([\ref=avgram]), so we must save any negative power of T. We are done unless

[formula]

in which case, since

[formula]

are enforced by the weight function, we have

[formula]

This shows that the interval of summation of m is at least as long as T1 - ε, by ([\ref=ranges]). On the GLH we can show in a standard way (see section [\ref=glhsection]) that

[formula]

Using this and partial summation gives the required saving in ([\ref=j0c1]).

The next step is to transform the m-sum using GL(3) Voronoi summation (see Lemma [\ref=vorlem]). Writing

[formula]

we get by Voronoi summation that the part of ([\ref=pois2]) with   ≠  0 equals

[formula]

where G±(s) was defined in Lemma [\ref=vorlem]. We have that [formula] equals c if [formula], and 0 otherwise. In the case [formula], we have [formula]. Thus ([\ref=vor]) equals

[formula]

Recall by the remarks following Lemma [\ref=vorlem], that up to negligible error, we can restrict the sum to

[formula]

So if we set [formula] then T- 6 < z < Tε and we can write [formula] in the fraction [formula] appearing in ([\ref=vor2]), and [formula]. Thus ([\ref=vor2]) equals

[formula]

where

[formula]

The goal is to show that ([\ref=vor3]) is bounded by a negative power of T. Using G±(s)  ≪  T- 1 + ε, a bound given in ([\ref=hbound]), and repeatedly integrating by parts in ([\ref=psidef]), we have

[formula]

for any k  ≥  0 and A  ≥  0. Thus up to negligible error, we may assume

[formula]

Using this, we have

[formula]

Preparation for Kuznetsov's formula

We first explain the idea of what we are about to do next. Our task is to bound by a negative power of T a sum like (when r = l = 1),

[formula]

By ([\ref=cap]) and z < Tε, we see that up to negligible error, we may assume ||  ≪  c2Tε. Also recall that |Ψ±(y,z;u)|  ≪  T- 1 + ε. By these remarks, the trivial bound for ([\ref=sumidea]) is [formula], and now we must save this much and a little more. We have already exploited the sums over [formula] and [formula] (they arose through Poisson and Voronoi summation). Now we will exploit the sum over c. Since the range of c in the sum is at least as large as [formula], a range sometimes referred to as the Linnik range (see [\cite=sartsi]), we are in a good position to use Kuznetsov's formula to transform the sum of Kloosterman sums into a sum of Hecke eigenvalues. This final sum will be estimated under the GLH to complete the proof. To get a feel of how this works, consider the generic ranges [formula], that imply [formula]. Using Kuznetsov's formula, we will get an identity of the shape

[formula]

Thus ([\ref=sumidea]) essentially becomes, ignoring the [formula] sum of length Tε and keeping in mind that Ψ±(y,z,w) has a factor T- 1 by ([\ref=vorstirl]),

[formula]

On the GLH, we get cancellation in the [formula]-sum and obtain the required bound.

To carry out the above program, we must first take care of the technicalities posed by the presence of the l and r parameters. First we detect the condition (,c) = 1 in ([\ref=vor3]) using the Mobius function by recalling that [formula] equals 1 if (,c) = 1 and 0 otherwise. Thus we need to bound the following sum, for each sign ±  , by a negative power of T:

[formula]

We can reorder this sum by the gcd of l and c to say that it equals

[formula]

Replacing l by lb and c by cb, this sum equals

[formula]

Now detecting (l,c) = 1 using the Mobius function, the sum above equals

[formula]

Using the Hecke relations ([\ref=gl3hecke]) and writing [formula], it suffices, to show that

[formula]

for some δ > 0. The given bounds b,d,r  ≤  T2 are enforced by the weight functions. Also note for later that the desired bound of ([\ref=kuzprep]) is trivial for the sub-sum restricted to [formula] using Ψ±(y,z,u)  ≪  T- 1 + ε and [formula], and Kim and Sarnak's bound

[formula]

We continue to reshape the inner sum in order to apply Lemma [\ref=kuzback]. We write

[formula]

where, after absorbing the factor [formula] into the function Ψ±, we let

[formula]

for w > 0. Since Ψ±(y,z;u) is restricted to T-  ε  ≪  y  ≪  Tε, we have

[formula]

Further, we have seen that Ψ±(y,z;u) may be restricted to z  ≪  Tε and u  ≪  zTε up to an error of O(T- 100). Thus by ([\ref=psider2]) and ([\ref=psider1]), we have

[formula]

for any [formula] and [formula]. Equivalently, by ([\ref=supppsi]) we have

[formula]

We see that up to an error of O(T- 100) say, we can assume

[formula]

So, since [formula] is restricted to (T-  ε,Tε), we have

[formula]

Thus ([\ref=phik2]) implies

[formula]

Finally we note some bounds on [formula] and [formula]. By ([\ref=cap]), we may restrict to

[formula]

which gives

[formula]

We already have the bound ([\ref=kcap]) on [formula]. So since [formula], we may eliminate c and record the bounds

[formula]

Also note for later use that Φ(w) depends implicitly on [formula] and [formula], and by ([\ref=psider1]) we have

[formula]

Kuznetsov's trace formula and the large sieve

Consider the sub-sum of ([\ref=kuzprep]) consisting of the terms with  > 0 and the positive sign case, the rest of the sum being similarly treated. Applying Lemma [\ref=kuzback] and the remarks following it, we see that it suffices to show that the following expression is bounded by a negative power of T:

[formula]

for

[formula]

and for any positive integers

[formula]

with

[formula]

For this last assumption, see the remark following ([\ref=kuzprep]). We only treat the first line of ([\ref=exp]) as the rest are similar.

We first reduce to the case

[formula]

Non-exceptional eigenvalues. Consider the contribution of [formula] to the first line of ([\ref=exp]). We have the bound

[formula]

by ([\ref=phik3]) and ([\ref=psibound]). Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we would like to say that the contribution of the non-exceptional eigenvalues to the first line of ([\ref=exp]) is bounded by

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

However, although ([\ref=cs1]) is essentially the right upper bound, to make the argument rigorous we must remember that (tg) depends implicitly on [formula] and [formula]. We can separate variables as follows. Write

[formula]

Insert the factors [formula] and [formula], where U1(x1) and U2(x2) are smooth bump functions that are compactly supported on [formula] and equal 1 on

[formula]

Generalized Lindelöf Hypothesis

In order to use L-functions to obtain the required cancellation in ([\ref=coffsum]), we must work with primitive Hecke cusp forms. To this end, we can take g to be an element of the special basis described in Lemma [\ref=bases]. That is, g = hc for some newform h of level dividing q. Writing out hc has a linear combination of h|b as in the lemma, and using the fact the coefficients in this linear sum are small, it suffices to prove that

[formula]

for some newform h of level q'|q (so that q' < Tε) and spectral parameter th = tg < Tε, and some positive integer b < Tε. If ρh(n) are the Fourier coefficients of h, then the Fourier coefficients of h|b (see definition ([\ref=slasdef])) are [formula] for b|n and 0 otherwise. Thus it suffices to prove that

[formula]

for some δ > 0. We have

[formula]

where λh(n) are the Hecke eigenvalues of h. By the standard (Rankin-Selberg) bound

[formula]

we find that it suffices to prove that

[formula]

for some δ > 0. To prove this it suffices to partition the interval

[formula]
