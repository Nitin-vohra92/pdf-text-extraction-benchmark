On the number of prime factors of Mersenne numbers

Introduction.

The nth Mersenne number denoted Mn is defined as Mn = 2n - 1. One easy calculations shows that if Mn is prime number, then n is prime number. When Mn is a prime number it is called Mersenne prime. Throughout history sought to find prime Mersenne. Some tools are very important in the search for Mersenne primes, it is worth highlighting the Lucas-Lehmer test. There are several papers that seek to describe the prime factors of Mn, where Mn is composed and n is prime. But, there are few papers which attempt to describe and quantify the number of distinct prime divisors of a number of Mersenne Mn, with n not being prime. In this paper, we propose to investigate the function ω(n) that represents the number of distinct prime divisors of n, applied to Mn.

Preliminaries Results.

If n is a positive integer, write ω(n) for the number of distinct prime divisors of n. Some well known facts are presented below as lemmas.

The first Lemma is the Theorem XXIII of [\cite=Ca], provide by Carmichael.

If [formula], then Mn has a prime divisor which does not divide any Mm for 0 < m < n. Such prime is called a primitive divisor of Mn.

We present the proof of the next lemma for convenience of the reader.

If d =  gcd (m,n) and m > n, then gcd (Mm,Mn) = Md.

As m  >  n, we apply the Euclidean algorithm to finding the greatest common divisor of Mm and Mn. Euclidean division applied to m and n, provides m  =  nq  +  r with r  <  n. Thus,

[formula]

Therefore, [formula]. Now, we show that the common divisors of Mm and Mn are the same common divisors of Mn and Mr. Let b be a common divisor of Mm and Mn. Then, [formula] and, therefore b|Mr, because b is not power of 2. Reciprocally, if b|Mn and b|Mr, then [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

Let (rj) be the sequence of the successive application of the Euclidean algorithm to m and n and, d the last term not null of this sequence. Thus,

[formula]

But, M0 = 0 and therefore, gcd (Mm,Mn) =  gcd (Md,M0) = Md, where d =  gcd (m,n).

If 1 < m < n, gcd (m,n) = 1 and [formula], then ω(Mmn) > ω(Mm) + ω(Mn).

As gcd (m,n) = 1, it follows that gcd (Mm,Mn) = 1 by Lemma [\ref=L2]. Now, by Lemma [\ref=L1] we have that there is a prime number p such that p divide Mmn and p does not divide MmMn. Therefore, the proof of proposition is completed.

The next lemma, was proven by Mihailescu (see [\cite=Mi]).

The only solution of the equation xm - yn = 1, with m,n > 1 and x,y > 0 is x = 3,m = 2,y = 2,n = 3.

For x = 2, the Lemma [\ref=L3] ensures that there is no m > 1 such that 2m - 1 = yn with n > 1.

Let p,q be prime numbers. Then,

[formula], if [formula].

[formula].

(i) We note that [formula]. Thus, if [formula], then

[formula]

i.e., [formula], where (q - 2)2p - 1 + 1 is the rest of the euclidean division of [formula] by 2p - 1, i.e.,

[formula]

i.e., 2p - 1|q. Therefore, the proof of (i) is completed. (ii) We note that [formula]. Thus, if [formula], then

[formula]

i.e., [formula], where (p2 - 2)2p - 1 + 1 is the rest of the euclidean division of [formula] by 2p - 1, i.e.,

[formula]

i.e., 2p - 1|p2. But, for p = 2 or p = 3, [formula] and for [formula], we have 2p - 1 > p2. Therefore, the proof of (ii) is completed.

It is known that all divisors of Mp have the form q = 2lp + 1, where p,q are prime numbers and [formula].

Mersenne numbers with [formula]

The only solutions of the equation

[formula]

are given by n, when n is a prime number for which Mn is a prime number of the form 2lp + 1, where [formula].

The case n = 2 is obvious. The equation imply in Mn = qm, with [formula]. But, by Lemma [\ref=L3], Mn  ≠  qm, with [formula]. Thus, if there is a unique prime number q that divide Mn, then Mn = q, and q = 2lp + 1, where [formula] by Remark [\ref=L5].

Let [formula] distinct prime numbers and n a positive integer such that [formula]. If [formula], where αi  ≥  0 is a integer and [formula], then ω(Mn)  ≥  t + 1.

By Lemma [\ref=L1], we have

[formula]

for each [formula]. Therefore, ω(Mpαii)  ≥  αi. Now, by Proposition [\ref=P1], we have

[formula]

Therefore, ω(Mn)  ≥  t + 1.

To facilitate the proof of the next two theorems, we present two specific cases of Proposition [\ref=P2].

Let [formula] and

p31|n, where p1 is a prime number or

p1p2|n or 2p1|n, where p1,p2 are distinct odd prime numbers.

Then, [formula].

For p31|n, we apply the first part of the proof Proposition [\ref=P2], with s = 1 and α1 = 3. For p1p2|n and 2p1|n, we apply the Proposition [\ref=P2], with s = 2 and α1  =  α2 = 1.

Let

p41|n, where p1 is a prime number or

p1p2p3|n, where p1,p2,p3 are distinct prime numbers or

p1p22|n, where p1,p2 are distinct prime numbers.

Then, ω(Mn) > 3.

For p41|n, we apply the first part of the proof Proposition [\ref=P2], with s = 1 and α1 = 4. For p1p2p3|n, we apply the Proposition [\ref=P2], with s = 3 and α1  =  α2  =  α3 = 1. For p1p22|n, we apply the Proposition [\ref=P2], with s = 2, α1 = 1 and α2 = 2.

The only solutions of the equation

[formula]

are given by n = 4,6 or n = p1 or n = p21, for some odd prime number p1. Moreover,

if n = p21, then Mn = Mp1qt, [formula].

if n = p1, then Mn = psqt, where p,q are distinct odd prime numbers and [formula] with gcd (s,t) = 1. Moreover, p,q satisfy p = 2l1p1 + 1,q = 2l2p1 + 1, where l1,l2 are distinct positive integers and [formula].

This first part is a immediate consequence of the Proposition [\ref=P3].

(i) If ω(Mn) = 2, with n = p21, then on the one hand Mn = psqt, with [formula], but on the other hand, by Lemma [\ref=L1] [formula], i.e., Mp1 = p, by Lemma [\ref=L3]. Thus, by Lemma [\ref=L4], Mn = Mp1qt = pqt, with [formula].

(ii) If ω(Mn) = 2, with n = p1, then Mn = psqt, with [formula]. But, by Lemma [\ref=L3], we have gcd (s,t) = 1. The remainder of the conclusion is a direct consequence of Remark [\ref=L5].

The only solutions of the equation

[formula]

are given by n = 8 or n = p1 or n = 2p1 or n = p1p2 or n = p21 or n = p31, for some distinct odd prime numbers p1 < p2. Moreover,

if n = 2p1, then Mn = 3Mp1kr, [formula], if [formula] and k is a prime number.

if n = p1p2, then Mn = Mp1(Mp2)tkr and gcd (t,r) = 1, with [formula], and k is a prime number.

if n = p21, then Mn = Mp1qtkr or Mn = psqtkr, with Mp1 = psqt and (s,t) = 1, and p,q,k are prime numbers.

if n = p31, then Mn = Mp1qtkr and gcd (t,r) = 1, with [formula], and and q,k are prime numbers.

if n = p1, then Mn = psqtkr and p = 2l1p1 + 1,q = 2l2p1 + 1,k = 2l3p1 + 1, where l1,l2,l3 are distinct positive integers and [formula], and gcd (s,t,r) = 1, with [formula].

This first part is a immediate consequence of the Proposition [\ref=P4].

(i) If ω(Mn) = 3, with n = 2p1, then on the one hand Mn = psqtkr, with [formula], but on the other hand, by Proposition [\ref=P1], ω(M2p1) > ω(Mp1) + ω(M2), i. e, Mp1 = q, by Lemma [\ref=L3]. We note that M2p1 = (2p1 - 1)(2p1 + 1) and q does not divide 2p1 + 1, because if q|(2p1 + 1), then q|2p1 + 1 - (2p1 - 1) = 2, a contradiction because q is odd prime. Thus, Mn = (M2)sMp1wr = 3sqkr. Moreover, by Lemma [\ref=L4], we have s = 1 if [formula]. Therefore, Mn = M2Mp1wr = 3qkr.

(ii) If ω(Mn) = 3, with n = p1p2, then on the one hand Mn = psqtkr, with [formula], but on the other hand, by Proposition [\ref=P1], ω(Mp1p2) > ω(Mp1) + ω(Mp2), i. e, Mp1 = p and Mp2 = q, by Lemma [\ref=L3]. Thus, Mn = (Mp1)s(Mp2)tkr = psqtkr and gcd (s,t,r) = 1 if s,t,r > 1, by Lemma [\ref=L3]. But, if [formula], then t = 1 by Lemma [\ref=L4] and clearly, [formula], because p1 < p2, i.e., by Lemma [\ref=L4], again, we have s = 1. Thus, Mn = Mp1Mp2kr = pqkr.

(iii) If ω(Mn) = 3, with n = p21, then on the one hand Mn = psqtwr, with [formula], but on the other hand, by Lemma [\ref=L4], we have Mp1 = psqt, with (s,t) = 1 or Mp1 = p.

(iv) If ω(Mn) = 3, with n = p31, then on the one hand Mn = psqtwr, with [formula], but on the other hand, by Lemma [\ref=L1], [formula], i.e., Mp1 = p, by Lemma [\ref=L3]. Thus, Mn = Mp1qtkr = pqtkr by Lemma [\ref=L4] and, gcd (t,r) = 1 by Lemma [\ref=L3].

(v) If n = p1, then Mn = psqtkr, with [formula]. But, by Lemma [\ref=L3], gcd (s,t,r) = 1. The form of p,q and k are given by Remark [\ref=L5].

We present some examples of solutions for Theorems [\ref=T1], [\ref=T2] and [\ref=T3].

ω(Mn) = 1 with n prime: [formula]

ω(Mn) = 2 with n = p21, p prime: [formula]; with n prime: [formula] and M6 = (M2)2M3.

ω(Mn) = 3 with n = 2p1, p1 prime: [formula]; with n = p31, p1 prime: [formula]; with n = p1p2, p1,p2 prime numbers: [formula]; with n = p21, p1 prime: [formula]; with n prime: [formula].

Mersenne numbers rarely have few prime factors.

We observe, that by Proposition [\ref=P2], we have ω(Mn)  ≥  t + 1, where t is the number of prime divisors of n, counting the multiplicity. Of course, that this lower bound depends on n, but it is necessary to obtain the factorization of n. The theorem below proved a lower bound which depends directly on n. To prove this theorem, we need the following lemma.

Let d(n) be the total numbers of divisor of n. If ε is positive number, then

[formula]

for almost all positive integer n.

Let ε be a positive number. The inequality

[formula]

holds for almost all positive integer n.

By Lemma [\ref=L1], we know that if h|n and [formula], then Mh has a prime primitive factor. This imply that

[formula]

Consequently, by Lemma [\ref=L6], we have

[formula]

for almost all positive integer n.
