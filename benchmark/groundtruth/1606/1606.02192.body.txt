Introduction

Gradings on algebras have been intensively studied in the last two decades, in the associative and non-associative cases. One of the main purposes of such studies was to obtain a description of all possible gradings on a specific algebra or a class of algebras up to graded isomorphisms. As examples, gradings on finite dimensional simple associative, Lie and Jordan algebras have been studied since then.

The finite dimensional simple associative algebras over an algebraically closed field are exactly the matrix algebras over such field. The first results concerning gradings on matrix algebras were obtained by Knus [\cite=Knus]. Some other works on the next decades have appeared, but only in the end of the last century a systematic study of gradings on matrix algebras was started. Initially with a paper of D asc alescu, et. al [\cite=Dascalescu] and later with other authors and papers, e.g.,[\cite=BahturinSegalZaicev] [\cite=BahturinZaicev] [\cite=BarascuDascalescu] [\cite=Boboc].

Gradings on matrix algebras have a wide range of applications. The special case of superalgebras, i.e., algebras graded by the cyclic group of order two, has been extensively studied and was applied to the study of identities of associative algebras, in particular to the solution of the Specht problem for associative algebras over fields of characteristic zero [\cite=Kemer]. Since then, the study of graded identities on associative and non-associative algebras has become of interest of many authors and an extensive number of papers about this subject has been written.

The knowledge of gradings on matrix algebras was also applied to obtain gradings on simple finite dimensional Lie and Jordan algebras [\cite=BahturinShestakovZaicev]. For this purpose, the authors in [\cite=BahturinShestakovZaicev] considered involutions on matrix algebras and obtained gradings on the Lie algebra of skew-symmetric elements and on the Jordan algebra of symmetric elements. This was shown to be possible if and only if such involutions act on homogeneous elements by preserving their degrees. Following this idea, in the mentioned paper the authors describe gradings on a matrix algebra with involution, satisfying such property, what they call involution preserving gradings.

When dealing with an elementary grading in a matrix algebra, one can easily see that the transpose involution inverts degrees of homogeneous elements. In the present paper, we study a problem related to this fact. We are interested in describing the gradings on a matrix algebra with an involution acting on homogeneous elements by inverting their degrees. We call such gradings involution inverting gradings. The approach to such problem is similar to that of [\cite=BahturinShestakovZaicev], i.e., we use the decomposition of gradings on matrix algebras as a tensor product of an elementary-graded matrix algebra by a fine-graded matrix algebra and we study each case separately. Nevertheless we use other methods and results, such as the graded version of the Skolem-Noether Theorem

The paper is organized as follows.

Section 1 is devoted to the description of the well-known duality between bilinear forms and involutions on matrix algebras. In Section 2 we recall the description of gradings on matrix algebras. In Section 3 we present some results of [\cite=BahturinShestakovZaicev] and [\cite=BahturinZaicev] about involution preserving gradings. Some of this results are used in Section 4, where we present our main result (Theorem [\ref=maintheorem]) on the description of involution inverting gradings, and the necessary background to achieve it. The mentioned results are valid for matrix algebras over algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero graded by a finite abelian group.

Involutions on matrix algebras and bilinear forms

In this section we recall the duality between involutions on the n  ×  n matrix algebra over the field F, Mn(F), and nonsingular bilinear forms on the vector space V = Fn. We identify Mn(F) with [formula].

An involution on an algebra A is an antiautomorphism of order two, i.e., a linear map *:A  →  A satisfying (ab)* = b*a* and (a*)* = a, for all a, b∈A.

Let V* be the dual space of the vector space V. A bilinear form b:V  ×  V  →  F is called nonsingular if the induced map

[formula]

is an isomorphism of linear spaces.

Let f:V  →  V be a linear transformation. Recall the transpose of f, ft:V*  →  V* is a linear application defined by: [formula] for all φ∈V*.

For a non-singular bilinear form b:V  ×  V  →  F, we define the following map

[formula]

One can observe that σb is an antiautomorphism of EndF(V). The map σb is called adjoint antiautomorphism with respect to the nonsingular bilinear form b. The map σb is clearly F-linear . Alternatively, it is well known that σb can be defined by:

[formula]

Next, we present a well known result whose proof can be found, for instance, in [\cite=InvolutionsBook].

The map which associates to each nonsingular bilinear form b on V its adjoint antiautomorphism σb induces a one-to-one correspondence between equivalence classes of nonsingular bilinear forms on V modulo multiplication by a factor in F* and linear antiautomorphisms of EndF(V). Under this correspondence, F-linear involutions on EndF(V) correspond to non-singular bilinear forms which are either symmetric os skew-symmetric.

Let *   be an involution on Mn(F) and let b:Fn  ×  Fn  →  F be the non-singular bilinear form corresponding to *  . If Φ is the matrix representation of b with respect to some fixed linear basis of V, then in the matrix form, *   can be written as

[formula]

Moreover, Φ is uniquely defined by *   up to a scalar factor.

Let Φ be the matrix associated with the non-singular bilinear form φ, and Ψ be the matrix associated with the non-singular bilinear form ψ. Then [formula] is the matrix associated to the bilinear form [formula].

Now, consider R  =  Mn(F) with involution * :R  →  R, written as a tensor [formula], where R1  =  Mk(F),R2  =  Ml(F), R*1  =  R1 and R*2  =  R2 and let Φ∈Mk(F) and Ψ∈Ml(F) be invertible matrices such that for all X∈Mk(F) and Y∈Ml(F),

[formula]

Let A∈Mk(F),B∈Ml(F). It is known that the involution of Kronecker product [formula] is [formula]. Hence,

[formula]

and it follows that the involution *   corresponds to a bilinear form [formula] on Fn with matrix [formula], and [formula] is the tensor product of bilinear forms φ and ψ.

A combination of the above remarks give us Lemma 1 of [\cite=BahturinShestakovZaicev]:

Let R  =  Mn(F) be a matrix algebra with an involution * :R  →  R. Let [formula] where Ri  =  Mni(F) and [formula]. Then there exist non-degenerate symmetric or skew-symmetric bilinear forms [formula] on Fn0, [formula], Fnk, respectively, such that, for each [formula], the restriction of *   to Ri corresponds to φi, [formula], and the involution *   on R corresponds to [formula].

Gradings on matrix algebras

In this section we recall basic results on the description of group gradings on Mn(F).

If A is an F-algebra and G is a group, a G-grading on A is a decomposition of A as a direct sum of subspaces [formula], indexed by elements of the group G, which satisfy AgAh  ⊆  Agh, for any g,h∈G. If a∈Ag, for some g∈G, we say that a is homogeneous of degree g and we denote deg (a) = g. The support of the grading, is the subset of G, [formula].

If 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n, we denote by eij the matrix with 1 on the position (i,j), and and 0 elsewhere. We call them elementary matrices. For each g∈G, let Rg  ⊆  Mn(F) be the subspace generated by the elementary matrices eij for i and j satisfying g- 1igj = g. Then [formula] is a G-grading on Mn(F) called elementary grading defined by [formula].

We recall a known result from [\cite=Dascalescu].

If G is any group, a G-grading of Mn(F) is elementary if and only if all matrix units eij are homogeneous.

Recall that the elementary G-grading defined by [formula] on the algebra Mn(F) can be regarded as the induced grading on the algebra of all linear endomorphisms of a G-graded vector space [formula], of dimension [formula]. The elements of Vg are called homogeneous of degree g, and if v∈Vg, we write deg (v) = g. A linear transformation f:V  →  V is called homogeneous of degree h if f(Vg)  ⊆  Vhg, for all g. Let [formula] be all distinct elements of the group G among [formula]. If πg:V  →  Vg is the canonical projection then πgfπh is a homogeneous transformation of degree gh- 1 for any [formula] and [formula] is the decomposition of f into its homogeneous components. By Fixing a homogeneous basis of V, one obtains an isomorphism [formula] of graded F-algebras. If one chooses distinct homogeneous basis of V, one gets graded automorphisms of Mn(F). In order to obtain an elementary G-grading on Mn(F) induced by [formula], it is enough to take [formula] with deg Vi = g- 1i, for [formula].

Another important kind of grading is the so-called fine grading. A G-grading on an algebra [formula] is a fine grading if dim Ag  ≤  1, for all g∈G.

In [\cite=BahturinZaicev], the authors prove the following result about fine gradings on matrix algebras.

If Mn(F) is endowed with a fine G-grading, then [formula] is a subgroup of G. Furthermore, all its non-zero homogeneous elements are invertible.

For an algebraically closed field, F, a particular case of a fine grading on Mn(F) is the so called ε-grading. If ε∈F is a primitive n-th root of 1, define the following n  ×  n matrices over F:

[formula]

It is easy to see {XiaXjb|1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n} is a linear basis of Mn(F) and that all products of these basis elements are uniquely defined by the relations

[formula]

Now, consider [formula]. For [formula], we set Cg  =  AiBj and denote Rg  =  spanF{Cg}. In the light of the above relations, we have [formula] is a G-grading on R. This grading is called ε-grading.

The next construction allows one to induce a G-grading on the tensor product of a G-graded algebra A, with the algebra Mn(F) endowed with an elementary G-grading.

Let A be any G-graded algebra, [formula] be the matrix algebra over F endowed with an elementary grading induced by [formula]. So, direct computations show that [formula] will be given a G-grading if one sets

[formula]

The grading defined above is called induced.

We now recall results of Bahturin, Sehgal and Zaicev [\cite=BahturinSegalZaicev], on the description of abelian gradings on matrix algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.

Let [formula] be a matrix algebra over an algebraically closed field F, of characteristic zero, graded by a finite abelian group G. Then there exists a decomposition n  =  kl, a subgroup H  ⊆  G of order k2 and a l-tuple [formula] such that Mn(F) is isomorphic as a G-graded algebra to the tensor product [formula] with an induced G-grading where Mk(F) is an H-graded algebra with fine H-grading and Ml(F) is endowed with an elementary grading determined by [formula]. Moreover, H decomposes as [formula], [formula] and Mk(F) is isomorphic to [formula] as an H-graded algebra, where Mni(F) is an Hi-graded algebra with some εi-grading.

Gradings and Involutions on matrix algebras

We now focus on Mn(F) with both graded and involution structures.

In the papers [\cite=BahturinShestakovZaicev] [\cite=BahturinZaicev2] the authors describe what they call involution preserving gradings (also called involution gradings) on the algebra R = Mn(F) with involution *  , (Theorem [\ref=bahturin-Zaicev] below) i.e., gradings [formula] on R, satisfying (Rg)*  ⊆  Rg, for all g∈G. Such description has important applications on classifications of group gradings in some classes of simple finite dimensional Lie and Jordan algebras. We recall such description here.

Let R = Mn(F), n a natural number, be a matrix algebra with involution *   defined by a symmetric non-degenerate bilinear form. Let G be an abelian group and R be equipped with an elementary involution G-grading defined by an n-tuple [formula]. Then, there exists integers m and l such that n = 2l + m, and after a renumbering, [formula]. The involution *   acts as X*  =  Φ- 1XtΦ, where

[formula]

and Is denotes the s  ×  s identity matrix.

Let R = Mn(F), n = 2l be the matrix algebra with involution *   defined by a skew-symmetric non-degenerate bilinear form. Let G be an abelian group and R be equipped with an elementary involution G-grading defined by an n-tuple [formula]. Then after a renumbering, [formula]. The involution *   acts as X*  =  Φ- 1XtΦ, where

[formula]

and Il denotes the l  ×  l identity matrix.

Let R = M2(F) be a 2  ×  2 matrix algebra endowed with an involution * :R  →  R corresponding to a symmetric or skew symmetric non-degenerate bilinear form with the matrix Φ. The ( - 1)-grading of M2(F) by the group G = 〈a〉  ×  〈b〉 is an involution preserving grading if and only if Φ can be chosen to be one of the matrices I, Xa, Xb or XaXb.

Now the description of the involution gradings on Mn(F).

Let [formula] be a matrix algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero graded by the group G and [formula] generates G. Suppose that * :R  →  R is an involution grading. Then G is abelian and R is isomorphic as a G-graded algebra to the tensor product [formula] of a matrix subalgebra R(0) with elementary grading and [formula] a matrix subalgebra with fine grading. Suppose further that both these subalgebras are invariant under the involution *  . Then n = 2km and

R(0) = Mm(F) with a elementary grading defined by [formula], as in Lemma [formula] if *   is symmetric or as in Lemma [\ref=Lemma2] if *   is skew-symmetric.

[formula] is a [formula]-graded algebra and any [formula] is [formula]-graded algebra as in Lemma [\ref=Lemma3].

Involution inverting gradings

A G-grading [formula], on an algebra A with involution *   is called an involution inverting grading if it satisfies for all g∈G, (Ag)*  ⊆  Ag- 1. One can easily verify that the above condition is equivalent to (Ag)* = Ag- 1, for all g∈G.

This section is devoted to describing analogous results to those in section 3, in the case of involution inverting gradings.

The next lemma shows that with the transpose involution any elementary G-grading on Mn(F) is an involution inverting grading.

Let R = Mn(F), n  ≥  2 and let t:R  →  R be the transpose involution on R. If G is a group and R has an elementary G-grading, then for all g∈G, (Ag)t  ⊆  Ag- 1.

Suppose such grading is defined by an n-tuple [formula] of elements of G. And write [formula]. Of course it is enough to prove the lemma for elementary matrices. Let eij∈Rg. Then g = g- 1igj. Clearly etij = eji and deg(eji) = g- 1jgi = g- 1.

Now a natural problem arises: "Describe the involution inverting gradings on Mn(F)". Such description is the main purpose of this paper. The results obtained here are similar to those obtained in [\cite=BahturinShestakovZaicev] and [\cite=BahturinZaicev] for the case of involution gradings.

The next result handles the case of elementary gradings on Mn(F) and an involution *   on Mn(F) satisfying (Rg)*  ⊆  Rg- 1.

In order to handle the case of elementary gradings, we are going to need a graded version of the well-known Skolem-Noether theorem. From the classical Skolem-Noether theorem, we obtain that any automorphism of Mn(F) is inner, i.e., given by permutation by an invertible matrix.

The graded version of such theorem was proved by Hwang and Wadsworth in [\cite=hw] and we recall it here. For more information concerning graded structures, simple and semisimple graded algebras, we refer to [\cite=tw]. In what follows, we denote by CA(B) the centralizer of B in A and by Z(A) the center of the algebra A.

Let F be a graded field and A be a central simple graded F-algebra. Let B be a graded simple F-subalgebras of A, C = CA(B) and Z = Z(B). Let α:B  →  A be a graded F-algebra homomorphism. Then,

There exists an invertible element a∈A such that α(b) = a- 1ba, for all b∈B.

If C is a division ring, then the element a of part (1) can be chosen to be homogeneous in A.

The element a of the above item can be chosen to be homogeneous if and only if there is a graded homomorphism γ:C  →  A such that γ|Z  =  α|Z and γ(B) centralizes α(B) in A.

In particular, we have the following corollary:

Let A be a central simple graded F-algebra. Then for every graded F-algebra automorphism φ of A, there exists an invertible homogeneous element a∈A, such that φ(x) = a- 1xa, for all x∈A.

Since Mn(F) is a central simple algebra, it is a central simple graded algebra, and the following is a particular case of the former.

Let F be a field and φ be a graded automorphism of Mn(F). Then there exist an invertible homogeneous matrix P∈Mn(F), such that φ(A) = P- 1AP, for all A∈Mn(F).

The next result describes elementary involution inverting gradings on Mn(F).

Let R  =  Mn(F) be a matrix algebra with an involution * :R  →  R, defined by a non-degenerate bilinear form φ. Let G be an abelian group. If an elementary grading [formula] is an involution inverting grading, then R, as a graded algebra with involution, is isomorphic to Mn(F) with an elementary G-grading defined by an n-tuple [formula] and with the involution X  ↦  X*  =  Φ- 1XtΦ, where one of the following cases hold.

n = 2l + m, for some l, [formula], and

[formula]

if φ is symmetric. In this case,

if m = 0, then after a renumbering, [formula], and g2i = g2i + l, for all [formula];

if l  ≠  0 and m  ≠  0, then after a renumbering [formula], [formula], and [formula];

if l = 0, *   is the transpose involution and [formula] are arbitrary.

n = 2l, for some [formula], and

[formula]

if φ is skew-symmetric. In this case, after a renumbering [formula], and g2i = g2i + l, for all [formula].

Let [formula] be all distinct elements of G among [formula]. Permuting [formula], i.e., changing the basis of V, we chose the isomorphic copy of Mn(F) such that

[formula]

Each hi above appears mi times, and

[formula]

with deg (Vh- 1i) = h- 1i and dim (Vh- 1i) = mi, for [formula]. Fixing any basis in [formula] we obtain an elementary grading on Mn(F) isomorphic to the initial one, such that any A∈Mn(F) decomposes in k2 blocks

[formula]

where Mij is of order mi  ×  mj and the matrix units of this block are of degree h- 1ihj.

Now let us consider * :Mn(F)  →  Mn(F) an involution satisfying ((Mn(F))g)*  ⊆  (Mn(F))g- 1. Let Φ∈Mn(F) be the matrix of the bilinear form defining *  . Write as above

[formula]

Now we observe that if X∈Mn(F) is homogeneous of degree g, then Xt is homogeneous of degree g- 1. Since (Mn(F)g)*  ⊆  Mn(F)g- 1 for each g, we obtain for all X∈Mn(F),

[formula]

In particular, applying the above for Xt, we obtain that deg (Φ- 1XΦ) =  deg (X), for all X∈Mn(F). Hence the map

[formula]

is a graded automorphism of Mn(F). In particular, it follows from Corollary [\ref=Skolem] that Φ can be chosen to be homogeneous. As a consequence, since the hi are pairwise distinct and Φ is invertible, in the block-description of Φ, one obtains that in each block-row and in each block-column, there is exactly one nonzero block. If Φii  ≠  0, since φ is non-degenerate, changing the basis of Vh- 1i we can assume that Φii = Imi, the identity matrix of size mi, if φ is symmetric or

[formula]

if φ is skew-symmetric.

If Φii = 0, since Φ is symmetric or skew-symmetric and non-degenerate, permuting [formula], we can assume that mi = mi + 1 and Φii + 1 = I. As a consequence, Φi + 1i = I, if φ is symmetric, and Φi + 1i =  - I, if φ is skew symmetric. Choosing an appropriate homogeneous basis of Fn, we obtain that

[formula]

if φ is symmetric or

[formula]

if φ is skew-symmetric.

Suppose now φ skew-symmetric. Using that Φ is of the form ([\ref=skew]), for each i and j, we have e*ij  =    ±  ej - l,i + l, where the sum on the indexes are taken modulo 2l = n. Hence, deg (e*ij) = g- 1j - lgi + l. On the other hand, since *   inverts the degree, we obtain deg (e*ij) = g- 1jgi. In particular, for each i  ≤  l and for j = 1 + l,

[formula]

which is equivalent to

[formula]

Hence, we obtain

[formula]

Applying *   on ei,i + l we obtain e*i,i + l  =    ±  ei,i + l and analyzing the degrees, we obtain for each i,

[formula]

Since G is abelian, g2i = g2i + l, for all i.

Now let us consider the case where φ is symmetric and Φ is as in ([\ref=symmetric]). If i,j  ≤  2l, the same arguments above show that [formula], g2i = g2i + l, for all [formula].

If i,j  ≥  2l + 1, we obtain e*ij  =  eji and such equation implies is no restriction on the elements of G. In particular, if l = 0, any [formula] induces a grading satisfying R*g  ⊆  Rg- 1. If m = 0, the relations satisfied by [formula] are the same as in the skew-symmetric case.

Finally, if l  ≠  0 and m  ≠  0, consider i  ≤  2l and j  ≥  2l + 1. Then e*ij = ei + l,j, again, the first indexes are taken modulo 2l. Hence for all i  ≤  2l and j  ≥  2l + 1,

[formula]

and we obtain g2j = gigi + l. In particular, [formula]. Since we also have [formula], we obtain [formula].

We now turn our attention to involution inverting gradings on Mn(F) graded by ε-gradings. The next lemma shows that there are no involution inverting ε-gradings on Mn(F), unless n  ≤  2.

Let [formula], n  ≥  2, be graded by an ε-grading. Let φ:R  →  R be an antiautomorphism. If for all [formula], φ(Rg)  ⊆  Rg- 1, then n = 2 and φ is given by φ(X) = Φ- 1XΦ, where Φ coincides with a scalar multiple of one of the matrices I, Xa, Xb or XaXb.

Any antiautomorphism φ of Mn(F) is of the form

[formula]

for some nonsingular matrix Φ.

Let ε∈F be a primitive n-th root of 1. We consider the matrices Xa and Xb as in ([\ref=XaXb]). Let us analyze the action of φ on Xa and Xb.

Since Xtb = X- 1b, we have

[formula]

Since φ(Rg)  ⊆  Rg- 1, φ(Xb) = αX- 1b, for some α∈F×. Then,

[formula]

From the above equation and from the fact that Xnb = In, we obtain that αn = 1, i.e., α  =  εi for some [formula]. Moreover,

[formula]

Observe that Xb defines a linear transformation of Mn(F) by conjugation, given by

[formula]

and that Φ is an eigenvector of T associated to the eigenvalue εi.

Let now P be the linear span of [formula]. Then

[formula]

Since X- 1bXaXb  =  εXa, for each i, T acts in XiaP as multiplication by εi. In particular, all eigenvectors associated to the eigenvalues εi, are in XiaP. Then Φ∈XiaP, i.e., there exists Q∈P such that

[formula]

Let us now analyze the action of φ on Xa. Since for all g∈G, φ(Rg)  ⊆  Rg- 1, φ(Xa) = γX- 1a, for some γ∈F×. Then

[formula]

which implies that

[formula]

Write [formula], αj∈F and we obtain [formula]. Thus

[formula]

As a consequence,

[formula]

Since Φ  ≠  0, there exist j such that αj  ≠  0. Hence comparing the G-degree in the above equation, we obtain that [formula], i.e., n = 2.

Now, since Φ  =  XiaQ with Q = α0I + α1Xb, we obtain

[formula]

Since n = 2, X- 1a = Xa, X- 1b = Xb and the argument used above applies if we change a and b. As a consequence, there exists j∈{0,1}, and β0,β1∈F, such that

[formula]

By comparing equations ([\ref=alpha]) and ([\ref=beta]) above, for all combinations of 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  2, we obtain that Φ is one of I, Xa, Xb or XaXb.

Let R = Mn(F), n  ≥  2, be graded by an ε-grading and * :R  →  R be an involution. If for all [formula], R*g  ⊆  Rg- 1, then n = 2.

Since in the Klein group [formula], each element is its own inverse, Lemma [\ref=Lemma3] also holds for involutions *   satisfying (Rg)*  ⊆  Rg- 1. We restate this result in the new terminology.

Let R = M2(F) be a 2  ×  2 matrix algebra endowed with an involution * :R  →  R corresponding to a symmetric or skew symmetric non-degenerate bilinear form with the matrix Φ. The ( - 1)-grading of M2(F) by G = 〈a〉  ×  〈b〉 is an involution inverting grading if and only if Φ can be chosen to be one of the matrices I, Xa, Xb or XaXb.

A combination of the above results and the theorem on the classification of G-gradings on Mn(F) (Theorem [\ref=gradings]), gives us the main result of the paper, which describes the involution inverting gradings on Mn(F).

Let R = Mn(F) be a matrix algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero graded by a finite abelian group G. Suppose that *   is an involution inverting grading. Then, there is a graded isomorphism

[formula]

where R(0) is a subalgebra of R with an elementary grading and [formula] a subalgebra of R with a fine grading. If both subalgebras R0 and [formula] are invariant under the involution *  , then n = 2km and

R(0) = Mm(F), with an elementary G-grading defined by an m-tuple [formula] of elements of G. The involution *   acts on Mm(F) as X*  =  Φ- 1XtΦ, where Φ and the elements [formula] are as in Proposition [\ref=elementary].

[formula] is a [formula]-graded algebra and any [formula] is [formula]-graded algebra. The involution *   acts on [formula] as in Corollary [\ref=Lemma3'].
