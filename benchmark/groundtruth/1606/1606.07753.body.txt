Introduction

Throughout this paper, let [formula] [formula] denote the set of nonnegative integers, positive integers and the triangular numbers are tx = x(x + 1) / 2 for [formula] For [formula] set ζk  =   exp (2πi / k), and define the Modular group of level k by

For the positive integers j,k, and [formula] dj,k(n) denotes the number of positive divisors d of n such that [formula] and d*j,k(n) denotes the number of positive divisors d of n such that [formula] and n / d is odd. Moreover, let the upper half plane be defined by

[formula]

and the Dedekind eta function is defined by

In this paper, we treat the following problem of Mumford [\cite=Mumford]: In [\cite=Mumford], he defined The aim of this paper is to completely solve Mumford's problem for Γ(k),    (k = 3,4,5,6).

Following Farkas and Kra [\cite=Farkas-Kra], we introduce the theta function with characteristics, which is defined by where [formula] and [formula] The theta constants are given by Let us denote the theta derivatives by Jacobi's derivative formula is then given by

[formula]

Farkas and Kra [\cite=Farkas-Kra] treated the theta constants with rational characteristics, that is, the case where ε and [formula] are both rational numbers, and derived a number of interesting theta constant identities.

In [\cite=Matsuda1], we expressed [formula] [formula] by the theta constants with rational characteristics. For this purpose, we used the following arithmetical formulas:

(Sums of squares) Let [formula] Then,

[formula]

and

[formula]

We note that Zemel [\cite=Zemel] developed this method to other characteristics and expressed the theta derivatives by cubic polynomials in the theta constants with rational characteristics. For the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:sums-of-squares], see Berndt [\cite=Berndt] or Dickson [\cite=Dickson].

In [\cite=Matsuda2], we treated the case where ε = 1 and [formula] and expressed the theta derivatives by rational expressions of the theta constants with rational characteristics. For this purpose, we only used Liouville's theorem:

(Liouville's theorem) There exists no nonconstant elliptic function without poles, that is, a holomorphic elliptic function is a constant.

In this paper, we completely realize the high level versions of Jacobi's derivative formula for Γ(3), Γ(4), Γ(5) and Γ(6). Moreover, for Γ(8), we consider derivative formulas from the viewpoint of sums of squares and sums of triangular numbers. For this purpose, we mainly use the residue theorem:

(The residue theorem) The sum of all the residues of an elliptic function in the fundamental parallelogram is zero.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=sec:properties], we review the properties of theta functions. In Sections [\ref=sec:derivative-level4], [\ref=sec:derivative-level5], [\ref=sec:derivative-level6], [\ref=sec:derivative-level3] and [\ref=sec:derivative-level8], we treat derivative formulas for Γ(4), Γ(5), Γ(6), Γ(3), and Γ(8).

In particular, in Section [\ref=sec:derivative-level6], we derive the Köhler-Macdonald identity: where for each [formula] See the bibliographical notes of Farkas and Kra [\cite=Farkas-Kra]. Moreover, in Section [\ref=sec:derivative-level3], we show a relationship between derivative formulas and theta constant identities, and in Section [\ref=sec:derivative-level8], we use relations between sums of squares and sums of triangular numbers. It is noted that Adiga et al. [\cite=Adiga-Cooper-Han], Barrucand et al. [\cite=Barrucand-Cooper-Hirschhorn] and Baruah et al. [\cite=Baruah-Cooper-Hirschhorn] derived explicit relations between sums of squares and sums of triangular numbers.

In [\cite=Matsuda1], [\cite=Matsuda2] and this paper, we have shown the three methods to obtain derivative formulas: sums of squares, Liouville's theorem, and the residue theorem. It is noted that all the three methods can be applied to the case where [formula] or (1,3 / 4), and the derivative formulas are all different.
