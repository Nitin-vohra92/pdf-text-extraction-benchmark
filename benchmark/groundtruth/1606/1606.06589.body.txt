The gravitational field equations in Rastall gravity and the first law of thermodynamics

Introduction

For the first time, Jacobson could use thermodynamics to derive the Einstein field equations [\cite=jacob]. The Bekenstein entropy is the backbone of the Jackobson's approach confirming that the Einstein theory corresponds with the Bekenstein entropy [\cite=jacob]. Generalization of his approach to f(R) gravity shows that the terms other than the Einstein tensor in the gravitational field equations produce entropy and therefore modify the Bekenstein limit of the horizon entropy [\cite=jacob1]. In fact, such terms and thus their corresponding entropy production terms are the signals of the non-equilibrium thermodynamic aspects of spacetime [\cite=jacob1].

It is also shown that, in various gravitational theory, if the gravitational field equations are considered as the first law of thermodynamics, then we can find an expression for the horizon entropy in the spherically symmetric static spacetimes [\cite=pad] [\cite=pad1] [\cite=pad2] [\cite=pad3]. This approach is used to investigate the mutual relation between the gravitational field equations and the system thermodynamic properties, such as entropy etc., in various gravitational theories [\cite=j1] [\cite=j2] [\cite=j3] [\cite=j4] [\cite=j5] [\cite=j6] [\cite=j7] [\cite=j8] [\cite=j9] [\cite=j10] [\cite=j11] [\cite=j12]. In all of the above mentioned attempts [\cite=jacob] [\cite=jacob1] [\cite=pad] [\cite=pad1] [\cite=pad2] [\cite=pad3] [\cite=j1] [\cite=j2] [\cite=j3] [\cite=j4] [\cite=j5] [\cite=j6] [\cite=j7] [\cite=j8] [\cite=j9] [\cite=j10] [\cite=j11] [\cite=j12], authors have only studied theories in which geometry and matter fields are coupled to each other in a minimal way, and therefore, the energy-momentum conservation law is met in their studies. In fact, in their studies, the system lagrangian is equal to the sum of the its constitutes lagrangian including the geometry and the matter fields.

Rastall [\cite=rastall] and curvature-matter coupling [\cite=cmc] [\cite=cmc1] [\cite=cmc2] theories are two gravitational theories in which geometry and matter fields are coupled to each other in a non-minimal way. In these theories, the lagrangian of a gravitational system is not only a simple sum of the geometry and the matter fields lagrangians [\cite=cmc2] [\cite=smal]. For these theories, the energy-momentum conservation law is not always valid, and in fact, the divergence of the energy-momentum tensor is proportional with the derivative of Ricciscalar. This mutual relation between the divergence of the energy-momentum tensor and Ricciscalar is the backbone of the Rastall theory allowing a flux of energy between the energy-momentum source and the geometry. The Rastall hypothesis also modifies the Einstein field equations, a result that increases the hopes to describe the current phase of the universe expansion [\cite=prd]. From classical point of view, the Rastall's theory may be supported by the matter production process in the cosmos [\cite=motiv1] [\cite=motiv2] [\cite=motiv3] [\cite=motiv4]. The mutual relation between the Rastall cosmology and thermodynamics has recently been studied [\cite=plb]. More studies on this theory can also be found in Refs. [\cite=neutrast] [\cite=obs1] [\cite=obs2] [\cite=rastbr] [\cite=rastsc] [\cite=rascos1] [\cite=rasch] [\cite=more1] [\cite=more2] [\cite=more3] [\cite=more4] [\cite=cosmos3] [\cite=rw1] [\cite=fr] [\cite=hms].

Here, we are interested in studying the mutual relation between the thermodynamics first law and the Rastall field equations. Our survey helps us in finding an expression for the horizon entropy of the spherically symmetric static spacetimes in the Rastall frame work. Moreover, since the energy-momentum conservation law is not always valid in the Rastall theory, leading to an energy flux between the spacetime and the matter fields, we expect that, in addition to the entropy, the work and energy terms differ from the work and energy terms in the theories coupling geometry and matter fields to each other in a minimal way [\cite=pad] [\cite=pad1] [\cite=pad2] [\cite=pad3]. In fact, we study the effects of the energy-momentum flux between the spacetime and the matter fields, supporting the geometry, on the required work for applying a hypothetical displacement on the horizon. Our investigation also helps us in finding the corresponding energy changes during such hypothetical displacement. The G =  units are considered in this paper.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we address some general mathematical and physical properties of the spherically symmetric static spacetimes with an event horizon located at rh. In addition, we point out the Newtonian limit constraints on the Rastall theory. Besides, studying the relation between the thermodynamics first law and the Rastall field equations, we get the expressions for the some thermodynamic properties of horizon such as its entropy. Finally, as two examples, we calculate the entropy of horizon in the Schwarzschild and de-Sitter spacetimes. The third section, is devoted to a summary and concluding remarks.

Rastall field equations and the first law of thermodynamics

Consider a spherically symmetric static spacetime, with a horizon located at rh, described by

[formula]

where dΩ2 is the line element on the two-dimensional sphere with radius r. It seems that the Misner-Sharp definition of mass defined as

[formula]

where [formula], may play the role of energy in the spherically symmetric static spacetimes [\cite=pad] [\cite=ms]. Therefore, since event horizon is a null hypersurface (hab∂ar∂br = 0), we get

[formula]

for the energy content of a black hole with an event horizon located at rh. For the Rastall's original field equations, we have [\cite=rastall]

[formula]

which finally leads to

[formula]

where λ and κ are the Rastall's parameter and Rastall's gravitational coupling constant, respectively. As Rastall has been shown [\cite=rastall], this equation leads to R(4κγ - 1) = T, indicating that, since T is not always zero, the [formula] case is not allowed in this theory. Besides, it is also shown that if we use the Newtonian limit and define the Rastall dimensionless parameter γ  =  κλ, then for the Rastall gravitational coupling constant (κ) and the Rastall original parameter (λ) we have

[formula]

indicating that the Einstein result (κ = 8π) is obtainable in the appropriate limit λ = 0 which is parallel to the γ = 0 limit [\cite=hms]. It is useful to mention here that as this equation shows, since the Rastall gravitational coupling constant diverges at [formula], the [formula] case is not also allowed. Finally, the Rastall's field equations can be written as [\cite=hms]

[formula]

which leads to R(6γ - 1) = 8πT meaning that, in agreement with ([\ref=gamma1]), the [formula] case is not allowed in this theory. Moreover, as it is obvious from ([\ref=gamma1]), λ diverges at [formula], and thus, the [formula] case is not also allowed. Therefore, Newtonian limit indicates that, in fact, both the [formula] and [formula] cases are not allowed.

The one-one component of ([\ref=eins21]) yields

[formula]

where T11 = P(r) is the radial pressure of the energy-momentum source [\cite=pad], and therefore, it finally takes the

[formula]

form. Here, prime ([formula]) denotes the derivative with respect to radius (r). On the event horizon, f(rh) = 0 and therefore,

[formula]

Multiplying this equation by dV = 4πr2hdrh, one gets

[formula]

Since the horizon temperature is defined as [formula], where [formula] is the horizon surface gravity, and because we have A = 4πr2h for the horizon surface, one can use ([\ref=energy]) and rewrite Eq. ([\ref=eins27]) as

[formula]

where [formula] and dẼ =  - γdrh are the additional work and energy, respectively, due to the fact that the energy-momentum conservation is not valid in this theory ([\ref=r0]). Indeed, based on this result, the total energy of system consists of two parts including the energy of source or its Misner-Sharp content (dE0) and the dẼ term in line with the non-zero divergence of energy-momentum source ([\ref=r0]). The same story is valid for the work term. While [formula] is the amount of necessary work for applying an imaginary displacement drh to the event horizon in the theories of Tμν  ;μ = 0, [formula] is the additional amount of work which should be done due to the non-conservative nature of energy-momentum tensor in the Rastall theory ([\ref=r0]). It is also worthwhile mentioning that since γ is a dimensionless parameter, our definitions of [formula] and γdrh as the work and energy terms, respectively, are true from dimensional analysis point of view. Therefore, we define [formula] and dE = dE0 + dẼ = dE0(1 - 2γ) as the total work and total energy of the system, respectively. It is also a matter of calculation to show that

[formula]

Inserting this result into ([\ref=eins27]), one obtains

[formula]

Here, [formula] and dS̃ =  - 4γ[null] are the usual Bekenstein entropy and the entropy production term due to the non-equilibrium thermodynamic aspects of the Rastall theory, respectively [\cite=jacob1].

Indeed, as authors have been shown in Refs. [\cite=jacob1] [\cite=pad] [\cite=pad1] [\cite=pad2] [\cite=pad3] [\cite=j1], terms other than the Einstein tensor in modified gravities lead to entropy production and thus modify the Bekenstein limit of the system entropy in agreement with our result (dS̃). It is also necessary to consider [formula], equal to the Misner-Sharp mass previously evaluated ([\ref=energy]), for the black hole energy as well as the usual thermodynamic definition of work (dW = dW0 = P(rh)dV) to write the gravitational field equations as the thermodynamics identity (dE = TdS - dW) in theories which minimally couple the geometry and matter fields [\cite=jacob1] [\cite=pad] [\cite=pad1] [\cite=pad2] [\cite=pad3] [\cite=j1]. Here, the energy-momentum conservation law is not valid and therefore, the energy and work terms differ from [formula] and P(rh)dV, respectively. The latter is due to the fact that there is an energy-momentum flux between the geometry and the energy-momentum source in the Rastall theory, which changes the amount of work and energy. Now, defining dS = dS0 + dS̃, we finally get

[formula]

It is useful to mention here that, as a desired result, in the absence of the Rastall term (λ  =  γ = 0), we have S̃  =  Ẽ  =  W̃ = 0 and therefore, this equation is reduced to dE0 = TdS0 - dW0 [\cite=pad].

As an example, we use the Schwarzschild metric, in which [formula] and rh = 2m, to obtain the horizon entropy (S). It is easy to show that

[formula]

leading to S = S0(1 - 2γ) for the total entropy. Therefore, entropy is a positive quantity only for a Rastall theory of [formula]. Finally, for a de-Sitter spacetime, in which [formula] and [formula], simple calculation leads to [formula] and thus S = S0(1 - 5γ), meaning that entropy is positive if γ < 1 / 5.

Summary and concluding remarks

We saw that the Rastall theory of either [formula] or [formula] is not allowed due to the fact that the Newtonian limit should be satisfied by the Rastall theory. Additionally, starting from the Rastall field equations, we got a relation similar to the first law of thermodynamics helping us in finding an expression for the horizon entropy in this theory. In accordance with previous study [\cite=jacob1], our study shows that the term other than the Einstein tensor in the gravitational field equations, the Rastall term (γgμνR), leads to entropy production and therefore modify the Bekenstein limit. We also pointed out the entropy of schwarzschild and de-Sitter black holes in the Rastall theory.

Moreover, bearing the non-conservative nature of the energy-momentum tensor in the Rastall theory as well as the dimensional analysis in mind, we found proper descriptions for the additional terms (dW̃ and dẼ) obtained in the founded form of the first law of thermodynamics. Actually, since the divergence of the energy-momentum tensor is proportional to the derivative of the Ricciscalar ([\ref=r0]), there is an energy-momentum flux between the source and the spacetime leading to a change (dW̃) in the required work (dW0) for an imaginary displacement (drh) of the apparent horizon radius. In fact, while dW0 = PdV is the required work in theories of Tμν  ;μ = 0, here, dW = dW0 + dW̃ is the required work. The similar conclusion is also valid for the dE = dE0 + dẼ term.

Briefly, since the Rastall gravitational field equations differ from that of the Einstein theory, the horizon entropy in this theory also differs from that of the Einstein theory, a different which is due to the non-equilibrium thermodynamics [\cite=jacob1]. Moreover, unlike the f(R) gravity in which matter and geometry are coupled to each other in a minimal way, matter fields and geometry are coupled to each other in a non-minimal way allowing an energy-momentum flux between geometry and the matter fields. Such flux is the root of the additional work and energy terms obtained in getting the first law of thermodynamics from the Rastall gravitational field equations. In fact, our results claim that the Misner-Sharp mass definition is not a suitable definition for theories in which matter fields and geometry are coupled to each other in a non-minimal way. Finally, it is worthy to mention here that, in the γ  =  λ = 0 limit, the results of the Einstein theory are obtainable.
