Introduction

It has long been recognised that the properties of galaxies depend significantly on their environment. Optical studies were the first to shed light on the effect of the local density on the properties of galaxies. [\citet=Oemler74] and [\citet=Dressler80] first established the existence of a clear morphology-density relation, indicating a steady increase in the population of elliptical/S0 systems, and a corresponding decrease of spiral galaxies, in environments of increasing density. Later, with the advent of a large photometric and spectroscopic database provided by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey [\citep=York+00], a systematic study of the environmental effect on the colour, star formation and the structure of galaxies, became possible for a variety of densities and cosmic epochs [\citep=Balogh+04] [\citep=Cooper+06] [\citep=Wetzel+12]. In particular, it was highlighted that the specific star formation rate (sSFR) of galaxies depends on their environment, with an average decrease of one order of magnitude in sSFR when moving from more isolated systems to the densest regions [\citep=Kauffmann+04] at a given stellar mass. Simultaneously, different studies emphasised how galaxy properties depend primarily on the stellar mass of the system: lower-mass galaxies preferentially exhibit disky morphologies with a young (blue) stellar population, while massive systems are mainly spheroidal with old (red) stars [\citep=Kauffmann+03] [\citep=Baldry+04]. These findings highlight the importance of disentangling the role of 'nature', i.e. internal processes, and 'nurture', i.e. the ensemble of environmental processes.

It is reasonable to assume that, whichever are the environmental processes that affect the star formation in a galaxy, they must also - and presumably first - affect the gas (neutral hydrogen) content of the system, which is the material from which stars are formed. In particular, atomic hydrogen ( H  I) is known to be particularly sensitive to the environment: H  I discs are often much more extended than their optical counterparts and are therefore more sensitive to external influences [\citep=Yun+94].

Early H  I environmental studies focussed on galaxies in clusters, and revealed that these systems are significantly more H  I-deficient than those in the field, and that the magnitude of the H  I-deficiency correlates with the distance from the cluster centre [\citep=GiovanelliHaynes85] [\citep=Solanes+01]. Resolved H  I observations of the Virgo cluster [\citep=Chung+09] showed the presence of small, truncated H  I discs within 0.5 Mpc from the cluster core and head-tail H  I morphologies for galaxies at larger ([formula] Mpc) distances. It became clear that ram pressure stripping by the intra-cluster medium [\citep=GunnGott1972] is an important mechanism of gas removal [\citep=OosterloovanGorkom05] [\citep=Jaffe+15].

The advent of blind H  I surveys such as the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA [\citep=Giovanelli+05] enabled to extend the H  I environmental studies of to a wider range of environmental densities. [\citet=Fabello+12] used stacked ALFALFA spectra extracted from optically-selected galaxies and found that the average H  I gas fraction in galaxies decreases faster than the sSFR with increasing environmental density, consistent with a scenario in which the environment affects first the (extended) H  I disc and only later the (more concentrated) star-forming gas reservoir. From the comparison with the predictions of semi-analytical (SA) models of galaxy evolution, Fab12 concluded that ram pressure stripping of H  I discs is already effective in group environments with halo masses larger than [formula]. The same conclusion was found by [\citet=Catinella+13] by cross-matching the GALEX Arecibo SDSS [\citep=Catinella+10] sample with the SDSS DR7 group catalogue of [\citet=Yang+12]. These findings favour a scenario where the H  I content of galaxies varies smoothly across all environmental densities, with the classical field-cluster dichotomy representing only the two extremes of a more continuous trend.

Given that the environment acts on galaxies via hydrodynamical and gravitational forces, numerical simulations of galaxy evolution constitute a powerful tool to tackle its study. Although several simulations have followed the evolution of galaxies in a single environment [\citep=Tonnesen+07] [\citep=Limousin+09] [\citep=Villalobos+12] [\citep=Few+12], for a systematic study of the effect of different densities on galaxies of different masses, large-scale cosmological simulations are needed. Dark matter-only cosmological simulations and SA models self-consistently follow only the tidal forces that dark matter structures experience and cannot provide a complete view of the role of the environment. The advantage of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations over SA models is that they self-consistently follow both the gravitational and the hydrodynamical processes, provided they have sufficient resolution and dynamical range to make predictions for the interplay between galaxies and their environment.

In this paper we make use of EAGLE [\citep=Schaye+15] [\citep=Crain+15], a suite of state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, to study how the environment impacts the H  I content and morphology of galaxies in the z   =   0 Universe. EAGLE has been shown to reproduce several observed scaling relations of galaxies, such as the Tully-Fisher and the mass-star formation rate relations [\citep=Schaye+15], and predicts present-day galaxy colours [\citep=Trayford+15] and stellar mass assembly histories [\citep=Furlong+15] that agree with the observations very well. The properties of neutral gas in the EAGLE simulations have been explored in a number of works: [\citet=Rahmati+15] studied the H  I column density distribution and covering fraction in the circumgalactic medium around high-redshift galaxies, [\citet=Bahe+16] focussed on the H  I morphology and distribution in present-day galaxies, [\citet=Crain+16] explored the impact of mass resolution and feedback/star formation efficiency on the overall properties of galactic H  I, [\citet=Lagos+15] [\citet=Lagos+16] analysed the galactic molecular hydrogen and its connection to 'the fundamental plane of star formation'.

For our purposes, one of the strengths of the EAGLE simulations is that the ill-constrained efficiency of feedback processes have been calibrated against the stellar properties of the overall galaxy population, and neither gas properties nor environmental trends were considered during the calibration. The environmental effects that we aim to study are thus governed by gravitational and hydrodynamical forces that are modelled explicitly and followed self-consistently. Our approach to this study is analogous to that adopted in other works that made use of this suite of simulations: we first verify whether or not EAGLE predicts the observed scaling-relations with the environment, and then we use its predictive power both to extend these relations to regimes that are not yet accessible observationally and to investigate their origin.

The paper is structured as follows. In Section [\ref=thesimulations] we present a brief description of the simulations and describe the method adopted to derive the H  I content of simulated galaxies. In Section [\ref=comparison] we compare the predictions of EAGLE and of three SA models of galaxy evolution with the observations of Fab12 and Cat13, showing that EAGLE is in much better agreement with the observations than the SA models. In Section [\ref=predictions] we extend the predicted trends to a larger dynamical range of stellar masses and environment densities than has been observed. We discuss our results in Section [\ref=discussion], where we investigate the mechanisms by which the environment influences the H  I of galaxies. Finally, our conclusions are presented in Section [\ref=conclusions].

Simulations

A detailed description of the EAGLE simulations is presented by [\citet=Schaye+15] and [\citet=Crain+15]. Here, we briefly summarize their main characteristics. EAGLE is a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations performed in a standard ΛCDM framework, adopting the cosmological parameters inferred from the first-year Planck data [\citep=PlanckXVI]. The run that we consider for most of this paper is the largest simulation available in EAGLE (Ref-L100N1504). It follows the evolution of 15043 dark matter and gas particles in a cubic box of side length 100 co-moving Mpc (cMpc) from redshift z   =   127 to the present time via a modified version of of the N-Body + smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET-3 [\citep=gadget2]. The particle mass is [formula] for the dark matter and [formula] (initially) for the baryonic component. The gravitational softening length is 0.7 proper kpc below redshift z   =   2.8.

EAGLE uses a formulation of the SPH, known as ANARCHY [\citep=Schaller+15], which alleviates significantly the issues related to artificial gas clumping and the poor treatment of hydrodynamical instabilities associated with the classical SPH scheme [\citep=Kaufmann+06] [\citep=Agertz+07]. ANARCHY also uses the artificial viscosity switch from [\citet=CullenDehnen10], an artificial conduction switch analogue to that of [\citet=Price08] and the time-step limiter proposed by [\citet=DurierDallaVecchia12]. ANARCHY is similar to the SPH implementation SPHGal [\citep=Hu+14], for which hydrodynamical tests such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and the blob test produce outcomes comparable to those of grid hydrodynamical codes. We acknowledge that the blob test presented by [\citet=Hu+14] is truly representative neither for the resolution of the EAGLE Ref-L100N1504 run, which is typically two orders of magnitude lower, nor for the typical density contrast between the interstellar medium and the intergalactic gas. On the other hand, the outcome of an environmental process like ram pressure stripping is driven by the competition between ram pressure and gravity, and a blob test is only partially relevant to it as it does not incorporate the latter.

EAGLE incorporates recipes for sub-grid physics, including the star formation implementation of [\citet=SchayeDallaVecchia08], star formation feedback in thermal form based on the prescription of [\citet=DallaVecchiaSchaye12], radiative gas cooling and photo-heating for 11 different elements from [\citet=Wiersma+09a], stellar mass loss from [\citet=Wiersma+09b], and accreting supermassive black holes and AGN feedback in thermal form based on [\citet=Springel+05b], [\citet=BoothSchaye09] and [\citet=Rosas-Guevara+15]. Given that EAGLE does not model the cold gas phase, a global temperature floor Teos for gas particles is imposed, corresponding to the equation of state [formula], normalized to 8000  K at a density of nH   =   0.1 cm- 3. Gas particles are eligible to form star particles when they have cooled enough to reach temperatures log 10(T) <  log 10(Teos) + 0.5, and densities nH > n*H(Z), where n*H(Z) is a threshold that depends on the metallicity as described in [\citet=Schaye+15].

The free parameters associated with feedback are calibrated to reproduce three key observables at redshift zero: the galaxy stellar mass function, the size-mass relation of disc galaxies and the galaxy-black hole mass relation, which match the observations with an accuracy that is unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. Details of the calibration procedure are presented by [\citet=Crain+15]. The galaxy stellar mass function for the EAGLE run Ref-L100N1504 is in excellent agreement with the observations for stellar masses between 109 and [formula]. In our analysis, we will focus on systems in this range of stellar masses.

Computing the atomic hydrogen masses

Evaluating the H  I masses of galaxies in EAGLE is a non-trivial task, as the simulation was neither designed to account for the effect of self-shielding on the neutral/ionised phases of hydrogen nor to keep track of its atomic/molecular content. For consistency with previous works that used the same suite of simulations, we decided to follow the H  I-prescription adopted by [\citet=Bahe+16] and [\citet=Crain+16], which we summarise in the following.

For each gas particle in the simulated box, we compute the fraction of hydrogen that is neutral ( H  I+H2) by using the redshift-dependent fitting formula of [\citet=Rahmati+13], which is calibrated using smaller simulations with detailed radiation transport modelling performed via TRAPHIC [\citep=PawlikSchaye08] and consider gas to be in (photo+collisional) ionisation equilibrium with UV background with H  I photoionization rate of [formula] s- 1 at z   =   0 [\citep=HaardtMadau01]. As shown by [\citet=Crain+16], variation of ΓHI by a factor of a few has virtually no impact on the neutral gas content of simulated galaxies at z   =   0. The collisional ionisation rate of star-forming particles is computed by fixing their temperature to a value of 104  K, characteristic of the warm phase of the ISM, rather than using their SPH temperature, which only reflects the effective pressure of a multiphase ISM. In Ref-L100N1504, approximately 50% of the neutral gas mass associated with present-day galaxies with [formula] is contributed by star-forming particles, thus such a temperature correction is relevant to our study.

If a gas particle is eligible for star formation, we partition the fraction of neutral hydrogen into atomic ( H  I) and molecular (H2) forms as [formula] [\citep=BlitzRosolowsky06], where n is the gas volume density, P is the gas pressure, [formula] cm- 3 K and α = 0.92. Note that this partitioning is not unique, different approaches are indeed possible [\citep=Lagos+15] and can lead to somewhat different results. The procedure adopted here results in galactic H  I discs whose mass and size are in good agreement with the observations for [formula] [\citep=Bahe+16], but slightly too H  I-deficient in less massive galaxies [\citep=Crain+16]. We do not model directly the potentially significant influence of local radiation sources on the neutral fraction, but we point out that their impact on H2 fractions is implicitly accounted for by the empirical [\citet=BlitzRosolowsky06] relation.

In this work, the total H  I mass of each simulated galaxy - defined as a self-bound subhalo identified via the the SUBFIND algorithm [\citep=Dolag+09] - is determined in two ways. The first is to sum the H  I content of all gas particles that belong to that particular subhalo. This method gives the total H  I content of each subhalo and is preferred when we are interested in what the simulation predicts about the gas bound to a particular system. We use this method in sections [\ref=predictions] and [\ref=discussion]. H  I observations, however, know little about whether some gas is bound to a galaxy or not. Therefore, the second method is to sum the H  I content of all particles within a given 2D circular aperture and a given line-of-sight velocity range from the centre of potential of each subhalo. This provides a 'biased' estimate of the H  I content of a galaxy which is directly comparable to H  I surveys like ALFALFA. We adopt this method in section [\ref=comparison].

Comparison with observations

In this Section, we compare the observations of [\citet=Fabello+12] and [\citet=Catinella+13] with the predictions of EAGLE. It is important to reiterate that the EAGLE simulations have not been calibrated to reproduce the observed properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. Therefore, the trends that we report can be considered predictions of the simulation.

We include in our comparison the predictions of three current SA models of galaxy formation: those of [\citet=Guo+11], [\citet=Guo+13] and [\citet=Henriques+15], hereafter Guo11, Guo13 and Hen15 respectively. These models are based on the Millennium [\citep=Springel+05] and Millennium-II [\citep=Boylan-Kolchin+09] cosmological simulations, which assume the WMAP1 cosmology [\citep=Spergel+03], and they each incorporate the treatment of environmental processes via a number of analytic recipes. In these models, subhalos have a reservoir of hot gas at the virial temperature that steadily cools onto the galactic disc. The details of this process depend on the halo mass and on the metallicity of the hot gas. When a subhalo crosses the virial radius of a neighbouring friends-of-friends group, environmental processes are switched on: tidal forces and ram pressure stripping remove material from the subhalo's gas reservoir and deposit it onto that of the central galaxy of the group. The infalling subhalo is then left with less gas (or no gas at all) available for cooling and fuelling future star formation. It is important to note that the disc of cold gas is assumed to remain unaffected by this process, unless the subhalo is physically disrupted by tidal interactions. This assumption is the key to interpret the differences that we will show between EAGLE and the SA models. The models of galaxy formation implemented by Guo11 and Guo13 are virtually the same, but in the latter the underlying dark matter simulation has been re-scaled to the WMAP7 cosmology [\citep=Komatsu+11], and the parameters of the model have been re-calibrated to reproduce the same diagnostics considered by Guo11. In Hen15 the underlying simulation is re-scaled instead to the first-year Planck cosmology [\citep=PlanckXVI], details of the star formation threshold and the reincorporation of gas ejected by galactic winds have been modified with respect to Guo13, and ram pressure stripping is artificially suppressed in groups with virial mass below [formula].

We estimate the H  I masses from the 'cold gas' masses predicted by the SA models by using one of the prescriptions described by [\citet=Lagos+11], specifically that based on the star-formation law of [\citet=BlitzRosolowsky06]. This recipe uses the stellar and the cold gas surface density profiles to compute the H  I and the H2 surface density profiles, which we derive in each galaxy from its centre to five times the gas scale length, and then integrate to determine the total masses. The recipe gives H2-to- H  I ratios as a function of the stellar mass that are in good agreement with the observations [\citep=Lagos+11] and affords a more straightforward comparison with EAGLE, since the prescriptions for the molecular fraction are based on the same law. Note that, contrary to SA models, EAGLE does not ignore the presence of cold ([formula]) ionised gas. As a consistency check, we also computed the atomic and molecular gas fractions by using a simple recipe based on the classical [\citet=Kennicutt98] relation, which we inverted to derive the molecular gas masses. This yields H  I masses that are about 50% larger from those computed with the Lagos et al. recipe, but has overall little impact on the results presented here.

Comparison with stacked ALFALFA observations

[\citet=Fabello+12] used stacked H  I spectra extracted from the ALFALFA 40 per cent data set [\citep=Haynes+11] to infer the average H  I mass fraction (MHI / M*, or fHI) and the specific star formation rate (sSFR) as a function of the local galaxy density. The galaxies considered were selected from the GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey [\citep=Catinella+10]. Stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) are derived from SED fitting using a [\citet=Chabrier03] initial mass function (IMF). The environment density estimator used by Fab12 is the number N of galaxies with stellar mass above [formula] within a projected radius of 1 Mpc and within [formula] in line-of-sight velocity from a given object. The analysis is performed separately for two different bins in stellar masses, [formula] and [formula], in order to break the mass-environment degeneracy.

H  I masses in the simulation are computed by considering circular apertures of 150 kpc in diameter, corresponding to the Arecibo beam size at the median redshift of the observed sample [\citep=Giovanelli+05] [\citep=Catinella+10], and line-of-sight velocity ranges of [formula] by analogy with the observations (see Section [\ref=computingHI]). The stacking technique adopted by Fab12 combines data for galaxies at different redshifts with different signal-to-noise and may potentially introduce a bias in the calculation of the H  I fractions which is difficult to mimic precisely in the simulations. Therefore, we do not attempt to implement an analogous stacking technique in the simulation. Stellar masses are computed by using a spherical aperture of radius 30 kpc. Galaxy pairs separated by less than a half-mass radius of the larger system are considered as single systems [\citep=Schaye+15]. Finally, the environment density estimator N is computed as in the observations: projected distances are evaluated in the (x,y) plane and vz gives the line-of-sight velocities.

Fig. [\ref=Fab12_Fig3] shows the mean fHI as a function of the environment density N in EAGLE (circles+solid line) and SA models (dashed lines) for two different bins in stellar mass, and compare it to the data of Fab12 (shaded region, B. Catinella, private communication). In all cases, four bins of N are considered: 0   ≤   N   ≤   1, 2   ≤   N   ≤   5, 6   ≤   N   ≤   9 and N   ≥   10. Error bars and the thickness of the shaded region represent the 1σ uncertainty on the mean at a given bin of N and are computed by bootstrap resampling the systems in each bin of N for both observations and simulations. In Fab12, H  I fractions were normalised to the peak value to focus primarily on the H  I trend with the environment. Here, we prefer to show the unnormalized values in order to demonstrate the similarity of the simulations to the observations. Note that the vertical scale is different in the two panels: on average, the H  I fraction in galaxies in the more massive bin is about half of that in the lower mass bin.

From Fig. [\ref=Fab12_Fig3] it seems that both EAGLE and the SA models of Guo11 and Hen15 predict values of fHI that are in overall agreement with the observations. EAGLE and Hen15 slightly underpredict the H  I fraction in all galaxies with N   <   10 (see also Fig.[\ref=Cat13_Fig2]), whereas Guo11 overpredict it at larger N. An exception is the SA model of Guo13, for which the H  I fractions are almost a factor 2 greater than observed. The reason for this behaviour is unclear. However, when we focus on the trend with the environment, EAGLE is in better agreement with the observations than the SA models. In fact, for the low stellar mass bin, both observations and EAGLE indicate that fHI in galaxies drops by a factor of 4.5 when moving from isolated systems (N = 0) to high-density environments ([formula]), whereas the drop predicted by SA models is only a factor of 2 - 2.5. Similarly, for the high stellar mass bin, the observations and EAGLE show a drop of a factor of 3, compared to a factor of only 1.5 - 2.0 in the SA models. The magnitude of this drop is underestimated not only in SA models, but also in other hydrodynamical cosmological runs like those of [\citet=Rafieferantsoa+15]. Note that the rightmost points of each panel in Fig. [\ref=Fab12_Fig3] are displaced towards larger N with respect to the shaded area. In the SA models of Guo11 and Guo13, in particular, the rightmost point exceeds the plot boundary and it is not shown. Both in the simulations and in the data, this point refers to the average N for systems with N   ≥   10, thus suggesting that the run Ref-L100N1504 overpredicts the galaxy clustering in the high-density regimes with respect to Fab12 observed sample. The presence of intrinsic differences in the environmental distribution of our sample with respect to that of Fab12 can introduce a bias in our analysis. Specifically, by inspecting the distribution of N, we find that EAGLE predicts an excess of systems at N   ≥   5 and a deficit at lower N with respect to the observations. The SA models show a similar behaviour to EAGLE. An investigation of the origin of this discrepancy is beyond the scope of this study, so we attempt only to correct for this bias by defining an 'unbiased' subsample of EAGLE galaxies that follows the same distribution of N as the data. This subsample is built by using an iterative procedure where, at each step, we randomly extract an EAGLE galaxy from the bin of N with the largest (positive) difference between the fraction of systems in the simulation and in the data. This system is removed from the sample, the distribution of N is re-evaluated and extractions continue until the differences between the observed and simulated distributions are minimised. The trend of fHI with N for the resulting unbiased subsample is fairly consistent with that shown in Fig. [\ref=Fab12_Fig3] for the full sample, with the obvious difference that now - by construction - the average N predicted and observed coincide.

Fig. [\ref=Fab12_Fig7] shows the trend between fHI and sSFR for galaxies with [formula] located in dense (N   ≥   7, top panel) and sparse (N   <   3, bottom panel) environments. The comparison with the observed trend is only available for the high-density environment. Here, EAGLE agrees remarkably well with the observed trend. SA models fail in the region where the sSFR drops below [formula] yr- 1, markedly overpredicting the mean H  I fractions for galaxies in this regime. For comparison, galaxies with N < 3 seem to settle at a higher fHI with respect to the high-density systems with the same sSFR. Here, the difference between EAGLE and the SA models is smaller.

The different predictions of EAGLE in the two environments can be due to a number of things. First, it is possible that galaxies that live in denser environments have, on average, a greater M* at a given sSFR. Indeed, we find that, at the sSFR of 10- 12 yr- 1, galaxies with N   ≥   7 have on average twice the stellar mass as those with N   <   3, but this alone is not sufficient to explain a difference of a factor [formula] in fHI. Another possibility is that the H  I-to-H2 partitioning scheme yields a greater molecular gas fraction in dense environments, owing to the higher pressures in the interstellar and circumgalactic media. To investigate this possibility, we produced plots similar to those of Fig.[\ref=Fab12_Fig7] but for the molecular gas fraction (not shown here for brevity), finding little difference between the two environments. Hence, the only remaining possibility is that the drop in fHI in dense environments at a given sSFR is due to an effective drop in the H  I mass of these galaxies. This indicates that the environment can effectively remove H  I from galaxy disks while leaving the star-forming gas content largely undisturbed. As already mentioned, such a process is not modelled by SA models, which therefore show a different behaviour at odds with the observations. We stress that these results do not change if we use the EAGLE subsample that is unbiased for the environment.

Comparison with GASS observations

Cat13 used the GASS 'representative' sample, which is a complete sample of [formula] galaxies with stellar masses [formula], to study the environmental effects on the H  I content of these systems as a function of their stellar mass. The environment in this case is characterised in terms of the virial mass of the host halo to which a galaxy belongs, which has been estimated by [\citet=Yang+12] for the SDSS DR7 catalogue using a friends-of-friends (FoF) group finder algorithm. In cosmological simulations, the virial mass of collapsed haloes is often characterised by M200, the mass contained within a sphere of a radius r200 about a galaxy's centre of potential within which the average matter density is 200 times the critical density of the Universe.

Comparing the prediction of the simulations with the results of Cat13 is complementary to the analysis presented in Section [\ref=fabello]. On the one hand, Cat13 do not rely on H  I stacking to infer the H  I fractions in their sample, and they use a clear selection criterion that can be easily applied to our sample of simulated galaxies. On the other hand, the calculation of the host halo virial masses in [\citet=Yang+12] is intrinsically different from that implemented in EAGLE: systematics can arise from the different linking lengths adopted to determine the FoF regions, which are defined in redshift-angular space in the SDSS catalogue and in physical space in the simulation, and by the different cosmological parameters adopted (WMAP7 vs Planck). However, we verified visually that the distribution of central and satellite galaxies in the stellar mass-host halo mass plane in EAGLE and in GASS overlap with each other, which is an important starting point for a detailed comparison between the two samples.

We first verify that the EAGLE galaxies have H  I properties that are compatible with those of the GASS sample. Fig. [\ref=Cat13_Fig2] shows the H  I fractions of each individual EAGLE galaxy with [formula], along with the mean and median values computed in different bins of M*, and compares them with the mean and median fHI derived from the GASS sample. To emulate the GASS selection criteria and enable comparison to Cat13, we applied a lower limit to the fHI of our simulated galaxies (shown in Fig. [\ref=Cat13_Fig2] by a dotted line): the H  I fraction of systems with [formula] and fHI   <   0.015 is set to 0.015, and the H  I mass of systems with [formula] and M[formula] is set to [formula]. With these conditions, the median fHI in the EAGLE sample scales with the stellar mass in a way that is consistent with the GASS sample. However, the average fHI of simulated galaxies is slightly below the observed values for [formula], implying that massive, H  I-rich systems in EAGLE are too rare. This was already noticed by [\citet=Bahe+16] and by [\citet=Crain+16], who focussed on EAGLE centrals and explained the scarcity of H  I-rich systems as being due to the presence of spuriously large H  I holes in the discs of simulated galaxies. Given that the median H  I properties of the simulated and the observed samples are in good agreement with each other for [formula], we proceed with comparing the environmental trends for the two samples.

Cat13 found that, at a given stellar mass, it is significantly rarer to detect H  I in those galaxies that reside in groups, defined as systems with host halo mass greater than [formula], with respect to those that reside in lower mass halos. This result, along with the predictions of EAGLE and of the SA models, is presented in Fig. [\ref=Cat13_Fig7Fig10_c], which shows the fraction of galaxies above the H  I detection limit of GASS that reside in groups with host halo mass [formula] (left panel) or [formula] (second panel from the left). While all SA models predict that the fraction of systems detected in H  I should be much larger than the observed values (with the exception of Guo11's model for [formula]), EAGLE is in excellent agreement with the observed trends. This is remarkable, considering that EAGLE has not been calibrated against the H  I properties of galaxies. The discrepancy between EAGLE and the SA models is particularly severe for less massive galaxies in groups with [formula], whose H  I content is very sensitive to the environment density (as we will see in more detail in section [\ref=predictions]). This discrepancy corroborates the idea that environmental processes are efficient at removing the H  I discs of galaxies, and do not affect solely their hot gas reservoirs. As we will see in section [\ref=satellitetracking], environmental mechanisms in EAGLE can fully remove the H  I component of a galaxy on short timescales while leaving its stellar component largely unaffected. We reiterate that these processes are not modelled self-consistently in the SA models, which can explain their different behaviour.

Cat13 found that analogous differences in the H  I detection fraction can be seen by splitting the galaxies of the GASS sample into central and satellites, with the former being more frequently detected in H  I with respect to the latter at a fixed stellar mass. This result is shown in the two rightmost panels of Fig. [\ref=Cat13_Fig7Fig10_c] and is not surprising, given that satellites live preferentially in massive halos. Also in this case the SA models predict fractions that are far too large (with the exception of Guo11's model for centrals), while EAGLE is in good agreement with the measurements. Note that, in the last panel of Fig. [\ref=Cat13_Fig7Fig10_c], the last mass bin is missing since there are no satellites in the GASS sample within that mass range (but a few systems are present in the simulations).

There are minor differences between the host halo mass distributions in EAGLE and in the sample of Cat13. As done before, we created an unbiased sample by selectively removing simulated galaxies until the two mass distributions become comparable. The results presented in this section do not change if we use such an unbiased sample rather than the complete one.

Analysis of the environmental trends

In the previous section we have shown that EAGLE reproduces the observed relations between the H  I content of galaxies and their local density. The comparison between the simulations and the observations was however limited to the most massive systems ([formula]). Also, the range of environments probed by the observations is relatively small.

In this section, we extend the relations above down to stellar masses of [formula] - the mass above which we consider galaxies to be well resolved by EAGLE - for a variety of environments. We adopt M200 as the estimator of the environment. With respect to the other 'observational' environment proxies based on galaxy number densities, such as the quantity N used in section [\ref=fabello], M200 is a more physically meaningful quantity and has a unique definition, whereas the other estimators are sensitive to the size of the region chosen to compute the density and to the stellar mass/luminosity threshold used. We note that all the observational environment proxies correlate well with M200, as shown by [\citet=Haas+13] and in Appendix [\ref=compenv]. The use of M200 as a proxy for the environment does not account for all the inhomogeneities and anisotropies in a halo. For instance, [\citet=Bahe+13] analysed the GIMIC suite of simulations [\citep=Crain+09] and showed that galaxies which are accreted onto a given halo along filaments experience stronger ram pressure stripping than those accreted from voids. The study of these effects is however beyond the scope of this paper.

We partition the simulated galaxies in five bins of stellar mass, ranging from [formula] to [formula], and six bins of M200, ranging from [formula] to [formula], for a total of thirty bins. We verified that the range of M200 is adequate to sample the majority of the environments to which satellite galaxies in the chosen range of stellar masses belong. We omit from our analysis all central galaxies, i.e. those systems that reside at the centre of each friends-of-friends group. This leaves us with a sample of 5549 galaxies in the chosen ranges of stellar mass and M200. Including central galaxies (an additional 2218 objects) would not alter our results significantly, because satellite galaxies dominate by number in high mass halos.

We impose a minimum H  I mass of [formula] to all our systems. This value corresponds to the mass of a single gas particle multiplied by the primordial hydrogen abundance and can be regarded as the resolution limit for the (total) hydrogen mass of our simulated galaxies. Also, we define H  I-rich and H  I-poor galaxies at given M* in our sample according to whether they occupy the highest or the lowest quartile in the H  I mass distribution. These H  I quartiles are first computed in bins of Δ log 10M *    =   0.25, and then fit with a second order polynomial to yield MHI(M*) quartile relations. In practice, this definition implies that only those systems with MHI   =   MHI,min are H  I-poor, while most H  I-rich galaxies have MHI   >   0.1  M*. In Fig. [\ref=fHI_histogram_all] we plot the distribution of log 10(fHI) for our sample of satellites (solid histogram) and compare it to that derived for centrals (dashed histogram). The two distributions differ significantly. Satellite systems show a bimodal distribution with a prominent peak around log 10(MHI / M*)   =    - 3 that is absent from the distribution of centrals. This peak is almost completely occupied by H  I-poor systems (red-shaded histogram). Note that this peak is artificial, being due to the minimum H  I mass assigned to galaxies: H  I fractions cannot be lower than MHI,min / M*, and this produces the sharp upper edge around log 10(MHI / M*)   =    - 3. Nonetheless, the difference between the two distributions highlights the dramatic impact of the environment on the H  I content of the satellite galaxy population. Centrals and satellites in our sample have a similar stellar mass distribution (not shown here). We now explore how satellites with different stellar mass living in host halos with different masses contribute to the global fHI distribution.

H  I fractions as a function of M* and M200

As we show below, a simple study of how the typical H  I content of galaxies depends on M* and on M200 would not give a complete picture of how these quantities correlate with the gas properties. In Fig. [\ref=fHI_histogram] we show the distribution of log 10(fHI) for the EAGLE satellites in bins of M* and M200. Stellar mass increases from left to right, M200 increases from the top to the bottom. Note that in the most diffuse environment considered in our sample (top row) fHI follows a roughly lognormal distribution. This has been reported by [\citet=Cortese+11] for observational measurements and implies that, if we aim to characterize fHI in terms of the moments of its distribution, it would be more appropriate to focus on the distribution of its logarithm, as we do in this analysis.

The effects of the environment on the H  I content of satellites can be studied by moving vertically along the panels of Fig. [\ref=fHI_histogram], i.e. by analysing how the distribution changes as a function of M200 at a given M*. We can identify a main and a secondary environmental effect. The main effect is that, when M200 becomes sufficiently large, the distribution of log 10(fHI) begins to show a bi-modality as H  I-poor systems - represented as red-shaded histograms in Fig. [\ref=fHI_histogram] - emerge as a secondary peak besides the lognormal distribution visible for the most diffuse environment. This peak becomes more prominent as M200 increases, and for the densest regions probed by EAGLE dominates the galaxy number density (see fractions on the top-right corner of each panel). A secondary effect is that, as M200 increases, the portion of the distribution that is not H  I poor moves slowly towards smaller values of fHI. This is more evident for [formula].

The fraction of H  I-poor galaxies increases with increasing M200 at given M*, and decreases with increasing M* at given M200. Thus the precise M200 at which H  I-poor systems appear depends on the stellar mass. For instance, H  I-poor galaxies with [formula] are already present around [formula], while those with [formula] emerge only above [formula]. This trend can be interpreted as follows: at a given M200, ram pressure stripping, tidal interactions and other environmental processes influence lower-mass galaxies more efficiently, because the gravitational restoring force is smaller and their H  I is less tightly bound to the system. Conversely, the number of H  I-rich galaxies, represented by the blue-shaded part of the histograms, decreases while moving from low to high-mass host halos. On the one hand, this is caused by the corresponding growth of H  I-poor systems with M200. On the other hand, the H  I-rich part of the distribution moves on average towards lower fHI as M200 increases. These two effects combine to produce a significant drop in the average H  I mass fractions for galaxies with increasing M200. This is clearly illustrated by the shift of the vertical dashed lines, which represent the mean (dashed) and the median (dotted) log 10(fHI), from the top to the bottom panels of Fig. [\ref=fHI_histogram]). We also notice that, in line with the observational findings of Cat13, at any given M200, the H  I-rich part of the distribution is truncated at lower fHI when moving towards more massive satellites.

We reiterate that systems corresponding to the H  I-poor peak have their H  I content fixed at [formula], the (hydrogen) mass-resolution of the simulation. As the true H  I mass of these galaxies might be anything between zero and this value, the red peaks in the histograms are artificial and the true shape of the distribution below the resolution limit, represented by the yellow-dashed region on left-hand side of each panel of Fig. [\ref=fHI_histogram], cannot be predicted by the simulation. However, regardless of their true H  I mass, these galaxies would still belong to the first quartile of the H  I mass distribution at any given M* and therefore would be classified as H  I-poor. We stress that these results do not change significantly when central galaxies are included in our sample. Centrals preferentially occupy the most diffuse environments and do not show a prominent peak of H  I-poor systems (see Fig. [\ref=fHI_histogram_all]), just like satellites galaxies in diffuse environments, and they therefore do not alter the overall picture described here.

We now show that the 'average' fHI as a function of environment and stellar mass depends both on how the averaging is performed, and on which galaxies are selected. The left panel of Fig. [\ref=eaglepred1] shows the trend of the average fHI with M200 for EAGLE satellites in five bins of stellar mass. Here the averaging is computed in two ways: the solid lines show the mean of log 10(fHI), while the dashed lines show the logarithm of the mean fHI. In the first case, it appears that the host halo mass determines the average H  I content of a galaxy: fHI decreases by 2-2.5 orders of magnitude when increasing from [formula] to [formula] and variations in fHI at fixed M200 as a function of stellar mass are minimal. Note that the slope of this relation may be underestimated, given that only an upper limit on MHI / M* is available for the H  I-poor systems. The cause of this trend can be investigated by following the vertical dashed lines in Fig. [\ref=fHI_histogram]. At any fixed M*, when M200 is increased the fraction of H  I-poor galaxies increases and the distribution shifts slowly towards lower fHI, leading to a net reduction in the average value. At a fixed M200, the fraction of H  I-poor galaxies drops when increasing M*, but simultaneously the H  I-rich tail of the distribution is truncated, producing little net variation in the mean. This is particularly evident for systems at [formula]. The dashed lines in the left panel of Fig. [\ref=eaglepred1] follow instead a much shallower slope, which is not surprising given that H  I-poor systems heavily affect the logarithmic average. In this case it would appear that both M* and M200 play a role in establishing the mean H  I fractions.

A different conclusion would be reached if we were unaware of the presence of galaxies that are almost completely devoid of H  I, which might be the case for an H  I-selected sample of galaxies. This is shown in the right panel of Fig. [\ref=eaglepred1], where we consider a scenario where only galaxies with [formula] are considered. Here, all trends with the environment are reduced with respect to the full sample, and stellar mass plays a more dominant role in setting the average H  I content of galaxies regardless the method adopted to compute the mean. Obviously, discarding the H  I-depleted systems from the analysis leads to a systematic underestimate of the effect of the environment on the global H  I content of galaxies. This is because the environment seems to control mainly whether or not a galaxy has any H  I rather than inducing a continuous trend, suggesting that the H  I removal happens on short timescales. We will discuss this further in section [\ref=satellitetracking].

In Appendix [\ref=convtest] we show the good numerical convergence of the fHI - M200 relation for the EAGLE satellites, which suggests that the resolution of the Ref-L100N1504 run is adequate to model the physics of the environmental processes. For in-depth tests of both numerical resolution and systematic uncertainties related to the partitioning of hydrogen into the ionic/atomic/molecular phases, we redirect the reader to [\citet=Crain+16].

H  I properties as a function of the group-centric distance

Galaxies located in the proximity of the cluster centres have, on average, less H  I than those located at the periphery of the these systems or than field galaxies [\citep=GiovanelliHaynes85] [\citep=HaynesGiovanelli86] [\citep=Solanes+01] [\citep=Gavazzi+06]. Classically, this is quantified in terms of ' H  I-deficiency' [\citep=HaynesGiovanelli84], defined for a given galaxy as

[formula]

where MHIobs is the total H  I mass of the observed system and MHIref is the typical H  I mass for a reference sample of isolated galaxies with stellar properties (i.e., Hubble type and diameter) similar to those of the observed galaxy. In nearby clusters, the mean defHI remains close to 0 for galaxies located beyond 1 - 2 virial radii from the cluster centre, and it increases to [formula] in the innermost regions.

We now verify whether or not satellites in EAGLE follow a similar trend. In the Ref-L100N1504 run at z   =   0, the number of FoF groups with virial mass in the cluster range is small: there are 7 groups with [formula], and none with [formula]. Thus, Ref-L100N1504 does not contain a galaxy cluster as massive as Virgo or Coma. However, it remains interesting to check if the observed trend is reproduced also at lower host halo masses. Another concern is that the original definition of defHI uses the galaxy Hubble type, which is not easily determined in the simulation. Instead, we calibrate MHIref on the simulated centrals via the following procedure. We select galaxies with [formula] and [formula] in Ref-L100N1504. This threshold in H  I mass corresponds to having at least 500 gas particles in each system, ensuring that the ISM structure is sampled sufficiently, and is similar to the H  I mass sensitivity for the observations in the Coma Cluster by [\citet=Gavazzi+06]. We focus on the centrals of this sample, for which we derive the median MHI as a function of M* using bins of 0.2 dex in M*. This relation is then fit with a polynomial, which we use to determine MHIref given the stellar mass of the satellite.

In Fig. [\ref=defHI] we show our calibrated defHI for satellites with [formula] in the Ref-L100N1504 run as a function of their distance from the group centre. The three panels show galaxies located in halos with [formula] (top panel), [formula] (bottom panel) or in between the two (central panel). In the least massive halo bin, the mean defHI tends to zero for d   >   0.5  ×  r200, and it increases only in the innermost region. In more massive halos, the mean defHI departs from zero already around d   =   2  r200, reaching a value of [formula] at the group centre. We found that the galaxies that contribute to the increase of defHI are those with [formula], while less massive systems do not show significant H  I deficiency. At first glance, this may appear at odds with the results of Section [\ref=HIfrac_vs_env], where we showed that satellites with [formula] are more sensitive to the environment than more massive systems (see Fig. [\ref=fHI_histogram]). Clearly, this is due to the fact that H  I-poor systems - being undetectable in H  I - do not contribute to the H  I deficiency. In fact, if we discarded all the H  I-poor satellites from Fig. [\ref=fHI_histogram], the only remaining trend with M200 would be a global shift of fHI to lower values, which is more evident for [formula]. In the bottom panel of Fig. [\ref=defHI] we also show the mean defHI measured by [\citet=Gavazzi+06] for galaxies in the Coma cluster (for which we assume r200   =   2.2  Mpc) and the mean defHI derived by [\citet=Solanes+01] in 18 other nearby clusters. Although we did not attempt to mimic precisely all the selection criteria and biases present in the observations, it can be clearly seen that the prediction of EAGLE is in good agreement with the data. In general, EAGLE is compatible with the idea that galaxies located within [formula] from the centre of groups with [formula] are more H  I deficient than those in the field.

We reiterate that the analysis of defHI is based on galaxies with detectable H  I masses. This gives an incomplete picture of how the environment affects satellites as a function of the group-centric distance, given that, as we have seen in section [\ref=HIfrac_vs_env], satellites in the most massive halos tend to be H  I-poor (i.e., their H  I mass is lower than the particle mass resolution of the simulation). To offer a more complete perspective, we show in Fig. [\ref=d_histogram] the distributions of d / r200 for all satellites in our simulated galaxy sample, distinguishing between galaxies that are H  I-poor (red histogram), H  I-rich (blue histogram) or in between (' H  I-regular', yellow histogram). Clearly, these three categories of systems have a different spatial distribution within their groups, with the H  I-poor and H  I-rich satellites being the most and least concentrated, respectively. This is in line with the observational findings of [\citet=HessWilcots13] based on ALFALFA data, and can be quantified by looking at the cumulative distributions (solid lines in Fig. [\ref=d_histogram]): 76% of the H  I-poor satellites are located within the virial radius, compared to 47% for the H  I-rich systems. This discrepancy is more severe at 0.5  r200, where these fractions become 50% and 22% respectively. Here we do not show the d / r200 distribution for different ranges of stellar mass and host halo mass, as we did not find a significant trend with these two quantities.

A similar - but more pronounced - segregation between H  I-rich and H  I-poor satellites is observed in the Local Group, where the dwarf galaxies located within a virial radius from either the Milky Way or M31 have virtually no cold gas (with the notable exception of the Magellanic Clouds), while those farther away are all bright in H  I [\citep=GrcevichPutman09] [\citep=Spekkens+14]. Unfortunately the mass resolution of EAGLE does not enable us to probe the dwarf regime. Zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, such as the APOSTLE runs [\citep=Sawala+16] [\citep=Fattahi+16], constitute an excellent tool to extend the analysis presented here to galaxies with [formula].

The physical origin of the environmental trends

In this Section we discuss which environmental effects cause a satellite galaxy in the simulation to lose gas and become H  I-poor. We focus on those processes that act on a galaxy's ISM and can thus directly remove H  I from a system. We note that other environmental processes can indirectly alter the H  I content of a galaxy: an example is the 'starvation' mechanism [\citep=Bekki+02], where the ram-pressure or tidal stripping of a galaxy's hot gas reservoir inhibits further gas accretion onto the disc, with long-term consequences to the cold gas content of the system. We distinguish between three different mechanisms: ram pressure stripping by the galaxy's motion relative to the intra-group medium (IGM), tidal stripping by the host halo, and high-speed satellite-satellite interactions. We first verify whether or not these mechanisms are at work in the simulation at z   =   0, which galaxies are currently affected by them, where these systems are located, and what is their H  I morphology. Then, we focus on the H  I-poor satellites at z   =   0 and track their H  I content back in time to relate their gas loss to one or more of these mechanisms.

Environmental effects at z = 0

We focus on satellite galaxies with [formula] and [formula] in Ref-L100N1504. As in section [\ref=radialdistrib], this threshold in H  I mass ensures that the satellite's ISM is adequately sampled. We find 1404 systems that meet these criteria. For each system, we estimate the environmental effects that it is currently experiencing as follows.

Ram pressure stripping: we use the classical formula of [\citet=GunnGott1972] to establish whether the pressure exerted by the IGM onto the ISM of a galaxy suffices to overcome its gravitational restoring force at a given radius R. This happens when

[formula]

where ρ is the IGM density, v is the relative velocity between the satellite and the surrounding IGM, Φ is the gravitational potential, ∂Φ(R,z) / ∂z|z = 0 is the gravitational acceleration towards the midplane at radius R, and ΣISM(R) is the ISM surface density at this radius. Eq. ([\ref=rampressure]) assumes that the IGM flows perpendicular to the galaxy disc, but we apply it regardless of the 'wind' direction in order to derive a rough estimate of the ram pressure. Typically, the wind direction has little influence on the gas loss [\citep=RoedigerBruggen07]. The mean density and velocity of the IGM are evaluated as mass-weighted quantities over the nearest 500 particles about the satellite's centre which are not members of any gravitationally bound subhalo (except for the host subhalo). This allows us to focus on the intergalactic material that surrounds the system - at typical distances ranging from 15 to 100 kpc - and avoid contamination by other satellites, whose environmental influence is studied separately (see below). The number of gas particles adopted ensures that the IGM around the satellites is well sampled. We tried to vary this number by a factor of a few and found no significant difference in our results.

We compute the right-hand-side of Eq. ([\ref=rampressure]) at the galactocentric radius RHI, the radius beyond which the H  I column density drops below [formula]. At this radius, we expect most hydrogen to be in atomic form, thus [formula], with [formula]. [\citet=Bahe+16] have shown that centrals in EAGLE follow closely the observed MHI - RHI relation of [\citet=BroeilsRhee97], thus we infer the value of RHI from the total H  I mass of our systems. In practice, RHI is the radius where the H  I surface density would be [formula] if the system were unperturbed. In order to evaluate the restoring acceleration, we first rotate our systems to a face-on view by projecting all particles to the reference frame given by the eigenvectors of the system's inertia tensor. The latter is derived for star particles within RHI. We checked visually that, with this method, galaxies are aligned face-on. Then, we approximate the partial derivative in Eq. ([\ref=rampressure]) as / 2ε, where ε   =   2.66  kpc is the Plummer-equivalent gravitational softening length. We verified that a different choice of ε has little impact on our results. In our case, the condition expressed by Eq. ([\ref=rampressure]) implies that ram pressure by the IGM is capable of stripping the galaxy's H  I at the location where the ISM has a surface density of [formula]. We calculate the ratio between the left-hand-side (Pram) and the right-hand-side (Pgrav) of Eq. ([\ref=rampressure]) for all satellites in the simulation at z   =   0.

The top row of Fig. [\ref=maps] shows the stellar and H  I maps for five representative satellites where log 10(Pram / Pgrav) is respectively 0.1, 1, 1.4, 1.9 and 2.3. In all cases, we verified that ram pressure effects are dominant with respect to the other environmental mechanisms studied here (i.e., the latter are well below their assumed threshold values, see below). Clearly, the H  I morphology becomes more and more disturbed when moving towards the rightmost panels, indicating that Eq. ([\ref=rampressure]) can be used to pinpoint effectively those systems for which ram pressure is significant. While the first system has an undisturbed H  I morphology, the second begins to show H  I contours that are more elongated in the direction of the wind flow. The next two systems show clear head-tail H  I morphologies, but the most significant case is the last one, where the H  I bends spectacularly in the direction of the IGM flow. A similar feature is observed in NGC 4405 in the Virgo Cluster [\citep=Chung+09]. In this simulated galaxy, the ram pressure is so strong that even the innermost H  I contour is significantly displaced from the stellar disc. Note that generally the direction of the wind is consistent with the galaxy's H  I morphology.

Tidal stripping: the tidal radius, rt, for a satellite that moves in a circular orbit around a spherical host halo can be approximated as

[formula]

where m is the total mass of the satellite and M(r) is the total (baryonic+dark) matter mass within the orbit radius r [\citep=bt08]. We expect that material beyond the tidal radius can be stripped from the satellites because of the gravitational pull of the main halo. In the more realistic case of eccentric orbits Eq. ([\ref=tidalstripping]) is valid only when the satellite is close to the orbit's pericentre: in this case r is the pericentric radius. The tidal radius is not a well-defined quantity at any point of a general orbit. As we are interested in deriving a proxy for the ongoing tidal effects, we make the crude assumption that all satellites are on circular orbits and evaluate rt by using Eq. ([\ref=tidalstripping]), with r being the current distance between the satellite and the potential minimum of its host halo. For consistency with the analysis of the ram pressure effects, we compare the tidal radius with RHI (see above).

The central row of Fig. [\ref=maps] shows the stellar and H  I maps for five representative satellites where log 10(RHI / rt) is, respectively, -1, -0.6, -0.4, -0.2 and 0. In all five cases we have verified that the other environmental effects are not strong, so that we can focus on tidal effects alone. While the first system has an unperturbed H  I morphology, all the others show some degree of disturbance in their stellar and, especially, in their H  I components. In the last two cases, the satellite is close to the central galaxy of the group and this distorts their H  I reservoirs into spectacular filaments that, at the column density of 1019  cm -  2, encompass both galaxies. In general, it is not straightforward to predict the fate of the H  I that is tidally perturbed. However, we feel confident in using Eq. ([\ref=tidalstripping]) to identify systems that are tidally perturbed in the simulation.

Satellite encounters: high-speed encounters between satellite galaxies can produce tidal shocks that dynamically heat the systems. The amount of heat Es that an extended satellite of total mass Ms gains during an encounter with a point-like system of total mass Mp can be computed via the impulsive approximation as

[formula]

where v is the relative velocity between the two objects, b is the impact parameter and [formula] is the mass-weighted mean square radius (Σimir2i  /  Σimi) of the extended system [\citep=bt08]. Eq. ([\ref=heating]) can be used to predict the outcome of a high-speed encounter between a satellite pair, but it is not generally applicable to the ongoing mutual interaction between any given satellite pair. Also, Eq. ([\ref=heating]) is valid in the limit b   ≫   rs, with rs being the typical size of the extended system. As for the other mechanisms studied, we simply use Eq. ([\ref=heating]) as a proxy for the ongoing effect of the interaction between satellites, and then we show that those systems with Es above a given threshold actually have a disturbed H  I morphology. We evaluate Es by using Eq. ([\ref=heating]) where we substitute the current distance between the satellite pair for the impact parameter b. In practice, for each satellite in our sample we evaluate the maximum Es by considering all possible 'perturber' subhalos belonging to the satellite's group (excluding the central subhalo), and we compare this value with the total (kinetic + potential) internal energy Eint of the satellite. We stress that the perturbers considered are all the satellite subhalos identified by the SUBFIND algorithm, and are not limited to those with [formula]. We verified that the results presented below do not change significantly if, instead of the maximum Es, we use the sum of Es over all the perturbers. This suggests that the role of multiple simultaneous interactions is minor, i.e., a single perturber typically dominates the dynamical heating of a system.

The bottom row of Fig. [\ref=maps] shows five examples of systems that are increasingly affected by this environmental mechanism, while ram pressure and tidal interactions with the host halo are negligible. The first system is unperturbed (log 10(Es / Eint)   =    - 2.5), but the others have H  I morphologies with an increasing complexity. The third system is particularly interesting, as it consists of three interacting satellites surrounded by a common H  I envelope at a column density of 1019  cm -  2. Note that while the interaction between these galaxies is evident from their H  I morphology, their stellar components are only marginally disturbed, similar to what is observed in the M81 group [\citep=Yun+94]. This is also the case for the last two systems, reconfirming the importance of H  I as a tracer of the environmental mechanisms.

Our findings indicate that all of the three mechanisms considered can influence the H  I discs of satellites with [formula] and [formula] at z   =   0. The maps shown in Fig. [\ref=maps] help us in establishing 'ad hoc' thresholds above which the influence of each mechanism is significant: ram pressure begins to affect significantly the H  I morphology of satellites when [formula], tidal effects are important when [formula], and satellite encounters are relevant for [formula]. By using these thresholds, we found that [formula] of the systems in our sample are perturbed by ram pressure, [formula] by tidal interactions with the host halo, and [formula] by interactions with other satellites. For the latter, the typical perturber-to-system stellar mass ratio is 0.5. So, according to the simulation, the most common environmental mechanism that perturbs the H  I in a galaxy with [formula] at redshift z   =   0 is ram pressure by the IGM. Considering that a system can be affected by more than one mechanism at the same time, we found that [formula] of the satellites in our sample are affected by at least one of the mechanisms proposed. This drops to [formula] if we also include in our sample central galaxies in the same range of stellar and H  I masses considered, and assume that these systems are not affected by the environment. Note though that tidal interactions can perturb the H  I of centrals, as can be seen in two rightmost panels in the central row of Fig. [\ref=maps].

Fig. [\ref=ram_vs_tid] shows how the satellites with perturbed H  I are distributed in host halo mass M200 (top panel) and group-centric distance d / r200 (bottom panel). Satellites that are affected by tidal interactions tend to be found in groups with [formula] and are located within the virial radius of their group. Galaxies perturbed by ram pressure can be found also in more massive groups and at larger distances, although most (70%) of them are located within the virial radius of their group. We have verified visually that those satellites considered to be perturbed by ram pressure and located at d   >   r200 indeed have disturbed H  I morphologies. Finally, systems affected by interactions with other satellites exhibit a broader distribution both in d / r200 and in M200, although they are more common in the most massive groups formed in the Ref-L100N1504 run. Given that satellite encounters are rare at z   =   0, one may naively conclude that they have little impact on the evolution of the H  I content of galaxies. We now show that this is not the case.

Environment and H  I stripping

What are the mechanisms that deprive a satellite galaxy of its H  I disc? We have seen that there is a fraction of satellites that experiences significant environmental perturbations at redshift z   =   0. It is reasonable to expect that, for those satellites that are H  I-poor at z   =   0, environmental mechanisms acted at some point in the past and contributed to the gas loss. To explore this scenario, we identified those satellites (with [formula]) that are H  I-poor at z   =   0 in the Ref-L100N1504 run and followed their H  I content, and the environmental processes that they experience, back to redshift z   =   0.5.

The tracking of each galaxy is achieved by identifying its main progenitor in the merger tree as described by [\citet=Crain+16]. To achieve a good time resolution, we used specific EAGLE output files that are named 'snipshots'. These outputs are saved with much higher frequency than the regular snapshots - approximately every 125 Myr for z   <   0.5 - and still contain all the data required to perform our calculations. Ram pressure and tidal interactions are computed as in section [\ref=enveffz0], but here we use the stellar half-mass radius Rhm instead of RHI as a reference radius. This because a) RHI is not defined for systems without H  I; and b) we are interested in the removal of the H  I from the inner regions of the disc, thus Rhm provides a better-motivated choice. In addition, at this radius we expect that the baryonic component dominates the gravitational restoring acceleration, thus the right-hand side of Eq. ([\ref=rampressure]) can be more conveniently computed as 2πGΣbarΣISM [\citep=GunnGott1972], where G is the gravitational constant, and ΣISM and Σbar are the ISM and the stellar+ISM surface densities at R   =   Rhm. To deal with gas-depleted systems for which ΣISM   =   0, we assumed a lower limit of [formula] for the ISM surface density.

In total, we track 2482 H  I-poor satellites from z   =   0 to z   =   0.5, recording at each timestep their stellar and H  I masses, the M200 of their current group, their distance to the centre of the group, and the magnitudes of three environmental effects. For each of these systems, we determined the redshift at which the H  I is stripped from the galaxy, zstrip, as the snipshot at which the H  I mass crosses a threshold of [formula], and stays above it in the two snipshots at higher z. We found that the H  I mass of satellites is either zero or well above this threshold (see top panels in Fig. [\ref=evolution]), which justifies our choice. We verified that using a different threshold has a negligible impact on our results. We found that 1613 (65%) of these satellites have lost their H  I in this redshift range. For these systems, we attempted to identify which environmental effect is contributing to the gas stripping. Unfortunately this procedure is not straightforward given that our environment estimators are crude proxies for the true ongoing environmental processes. In addition, it is often the case that more than one mechanism acts at the same time, which complicates further the analysis. The approach that we adopted is to carefully define ad-hoc thresholds above which a given process is significant, similarly to that done in section [\ref=enveffz0]. To achieve this, we first produced plots of Pram / Pgrav, Rhm / rt and Es / Eint as a function of redshift for each of the 1613 gas-depleted satellites. Then, by inspecting these plots, we identified those cases where a given mechanism is clearly the dominant stripping process.

For the case of ram pressure (or tidal) stripping, we focus on those systems where the removal of gas is associated with a clear peak in Pram / Pgrav (or Rhm / rt), whereas the other estimators do not show peculiar features around zstrip and/or are well below their assumed thresholds. In this way we determine that ram pressure contributes to the stripping when [formula], while tidal stripping occurs for [formula]. The case of satellite encounters is more complex. In most galaxies, we found that the gas removal is associated with a clear discontinuity in Es / Eint, which typically increases by more than one order of magnitude in the two snipshots before and after zstrip. Given that Es / Eint varies smoothly before and after the discontinuity at z   =   zstrip, there is little doubt that we can consider it as a signature of gas removal due to a high-speed encounter. Thus we consider satellite encounters relevant to gas removal when [formula], where the difference Δ is computed around zstrip. We stress that variations in energy ratio with redshift are usually well below 0.5 dex, and clear discontinuities can be seen only during these high-speed encounters. Additionally, we require the energy ratio after the removal to be larger than a given threshold. This is the major source of uncertainty in our calculation: based on our previous findings (section [\ref=enveffz0]) we set this threshold at [formula], as in this range perturbations in the H  I morphology should arise. We stress that the error bars reported for all these thresholds have no strict statistical meaning, but they have been chosen ad-hoc as representative for the uncertainties intrinsic in our procedure.

Fig. [\ref=evolution] shows five representative cases where the H  I loss appears to be caused by a distinctive mechanism. The upper panels show how the H  I mass and the group-centric distance of the system vary with the redshift, the bottom panels show (on a logarithmic scale) the various environmental effects which have been re-scaled to their respective thresholds (horizontal dotted lines). In the first two cases, the stripping happens when d / r200 reaches a local minimum, i.e. at the pericentre of the satellite's orbit. In the first example, the ram pressure peaks and dominates over the other environmental effects at z   =   zstrip, tidal forces are significant but not larger than the adopted threshold. The opposite happens in the second example, where tidal forces dominates while the other mechanisms are not relevant and do not show any peculiar feature at the moment of the stripping. In the third case, the stripping happens before the satellite reaches the pericentre because of a powerful energy injection due to a satellite encounter, which changes the system's internal energy by several orders of magnitude. The next example shows a situation where more than one mechanism contributes to the gas removal: in this particular case, all processes are simultaneously at work. Note that, in the last two examples, Es / Eint remains large after the stripping event. This is not due to further pair interactions, which would feature as additional discontinuities in Es / Eint, but rather to the decline (in modulus) of the internal energy of the system after the encounter. Finally, we classify the last case as 'unclear', because all mechanisms are below the threshold and no peculiar features can be seen around z   =   zstrip. Note also that in all these examples the gas removal occurs at d   <   r200.

Situations where ram pressure or tidal interactions alone are responsible for the gas removal are very infrequent, as they occur only in a small fraction of cases. It is instead more common that a combination of satellite encounters and ram pressure by the IGM are the cause of the gas loss. Regardless of whether or not these mechanisms work alone or together, we found that ram pressure, tidal interactions and satellite encounters are relevant to the stripping in respectively [formula], [formula] and [formula] of the cases analysed. Thus, it seems that the third of the environmental mechanisms proposed is the most common mode by which currently H  I-poor satellite galaxies with [formula] have lost their H  I content in the past. This finding might appear to contradict the results of section [\ref=enveffz0], where we showed that satellite encounters are the least common mechanism that perturbs H  I in galaxies at redshift zero. We believe that a simple explanation is that different environmental mechanisms act on different timescales: at a given time, the probability of observing a high-speed encounter between satellites is smaller than that of observing ongoing ram-pressure stripping by the IGM. A mechanism that acts on short timescales would also explain why the environment acts mainly as an on/off switch for the H  I content of satellites, as we found in section [\ref=HIfrac_vs_env].

For each of the 1613 satellites, we estimate the duration of the stripping process as follows. We set the beginning of the H  I stripping to the minimum redshift above zstrip at which the fractional variation in H  I mass (ΔMHI / MHI) computed between two consecutive snipshots is below a threshold of 0.1. The end of the H  I stripping is set to the maximum redshift below zstrip at which the H  I mass falls below [formula] (i.e, the hydrogen mass of a single gas particle). H  I masses are linearly interpolated between consecutive snipshots in order to refine the calculation. We find that the distribution of the stripping duration has median tstrip   =   230  Myr, and 16th and 84th percentiles of 100  Myr and 518  Myr. tstrip is not very sensitive to the exact choice of the threshold in ΔMHI / MHI, as using ΔMHI / MHI   =   0.01 (0.3) yields tstrip   =   280  Myr (200  Myr). Also, it depends weakly on M*, M200 and on the environmental mechanism considered: for instance, tstrip   =   210  Myr (245  Myr) for stripping clearly dominated by satellite encounters (ram pressure). However, our analysis is limited by the fact that tstrip is of the same order of the snipshot timestep ([formula]), which precludes the sampling of stripping events shorter than this value. Thus it is possible that the typical timescale for satellite encounters is much shorter than that for ram pressure stripping, as suggested above. In general, we can robustly conclude that the timescale for H  I removal by direct environmental processes is typically < 500  Myr. Interestingly, this is comparable to the quenching timescale for satellite galaxies in clusters inferred by [\citet=Muzzin+14]. As discussed by [\citet=Trayford+16], such a short quenching timescale would lead to a 'green valley' with properties consistent with those observed.

We point out that, in those cases where the H  I removal is solely due to satellite-satellite interactions, it is still possible that what ultimately causes the system to lose its gas is the ram pressure from the IGM. In fact, the gravitational restoring force that we compute refers to the case where the stars and the gas settle onto the midplane in a regular disc, and may be overestimated if the gas is misplaced from this configuration. Thus, Pram / Pgrav may be underestimated during the interaction with satellites. Note that we exclude from the computation of Pram the gas particles that are gravitationally bound to the other satellites, which may in principle contribute to the ram pressure during the satellite encounters. We verified however that including these particles increases the fraction of ram pressure stripped occurrences only by a few percent.

Interestingly, it is believed that the Magellanic Stream - the spectacular H  I trail that the Magellanic Clouds are leaving behind as they move around the Milky Way - is produced by the mutual interactions between the Clouds, and possibly amplified by the ram pressure by the Galaxy's hot halo [\citep=Besla+12] [\citep=Salem+15]. Despite the uncertainties of our analysis, our conclusions are consistent with those of [\citet=Besla+12], i.e. that satellite-satellite interactions play a key role in shaping the evolution of galaxies in the stellar mass range considered.

In Fig. [\ref=environment_final] we show how the 1613 gas-depleted satellites of our sample populate the (M200, d / r200) plane at the time of their H  I loss. Different colours are used to separate the different environmental mechanisms, and the contours enclose 30%, 60% and 90% of the systems. Clearly, tidal stripping operates nearly always (95% of the cases) within half the virial radius of the group, and rarely occurs in host halos more massive than [formula]. Stripping due to ram pressure and satellite interactions, instead, is common at all halo masses and can occur at a larger distances from the group centre, but usually inside the virial radius (in 89% and and 82% of the cases respectively). Our results are in agreement with those of [\citet=Bahe+13] who found that direct environmental stripping of cold gas occurs preferentially inside r200, whereas stripping of the hot halo can occur at distances up to 5  r200. Note that ram pressure and satellite interactions operate in a similar region of the (M200, d / r200) space, suggesting that an interplay between these two processes is possible, as discussed above. To gain insights into the origin of this interplay, we compared the average IGM density radial profile with the average subhalo number density radial profile derived by stacking groups of similar M200 in Ref-L100N1504. The IGM density profiles are evaluated by excluding all gas particles bound to satellites. We found that, for [formula], the two profiles have a very similar shape within r200, indicating the existence of a strong correlation between the intra-group gas density and the subhalo number density in this halo mass range.

In Fig. [\ref=environment_final] we also report those satellites whose H  I loss cannot be unambiguously related to one of the environmental mechanisms considered (thin dashed line). These galaxies constitute a significant fraction ([formula]) of our sample, and are also those located farther from the group centres: 60% of them are within r200, only 22% within 0.5  r200. Also, they are more frequent at larger M*, and dominate our satellite sample at [formula]. One might argue that in these system the H  I removal is due to a combination of environmental processes acting together, each of which individually would not have been strong enough to strip the gas. However, in many of these 'unclear' cases, none of the direct environmental processes considered shows significant enhancement around z   =   zstrip. Although we can speculate that both internal processes (e.g. AGN or stellar feedback) and indirect environmental processes (e.g. starvation) can contribute to the gas loss in these systems, a detailed analysis of these mechanisms is beyond the scope of this study. Our findings simply indicate that it is unlikely that in these systems the H  I loss was caused solely by one of the environmental mechanisms proposed.

Conclusions

In this work we used the EAGLE suite of cosmological simulations to study how the H  I content of galaxies is affected by their environment, for which we used the host halo virial mass M200 as a proxy. We first compared the predictions of EAGLE and of three semi-analytical (SA) models of galaxy evolution to the observed H  I-environment trends found by Fab12 and Cat13. Then, we investigated how the H  I content of satellite galaxies with stellar mass [formula] changes as a function of M200 and M*. Finally, we discussed which environmental processes directly affect the H  I content of a satellite and eventually remove it from its disc during its evolution.

Our findings can be summarised as follows:

Galaxies in EAGLE follow the observed H  I-environment trends found by Fab12 and Cat13 remarkably well, whereas the SA models predict systems that are too H  I-rich in dense environments (see Figs. [\ref=Fab12_Fig3] and [\ref=Cat13_Fig7Fig10_c]). A possible cause of this discrepancy is that SA models lack a self-consistent treatment of direct removal of galaxies' cold ISM.

By focussing on satellites, we found that the main effect of the environment is to control whether or not galaxies have H  I at all, rather than producing a continuous trend. At a fixed M*, the fraction of systems nearly devoid of H  I increases with increasing host halo mass M200 as a result of stronger environmental effects, and at a fixed M200 it decreases with increasing M* as the gas is confined by deeper potential wells (see Fig. [\ref=fHI_histogram]).

The H  I-deficiency increases within 1   -   2 virial radii from the group centre in halos with [formula] (see Fig. [\ref=defHI]), as also revealed by observations [\citep=Solanes+01] [\citep=Gavazzi+06].

Satellites devoid of H  I tend to be concentrated within the virial radius of their group, whereas H  I-rich satellites are more sparsely distributed (see Fig. [\ref=d_histogram]).

At redshift z   =   0, the most common environmental mechanism that can visibly affect the H  I morphology of a satellite with [formula] is the ram pressure of the IGM, while tidal interactions with the host halo and satellite-satellite encounters are less frequent. Tidal interactions are confined to the virial radius of halos with [formula], ram pressure and satellite encounters can be effective also at larger distances and in more massive halos (see Fig. [\ref=ram_vs_tid]).

By tracking back in time the H  I content and the environmental properties of satellites that are devoid of H  I at redshift z   =   0, we found that the most common stripping mechanism is satellite-satellite interactions, followed by ram pressure and tidal stripping. The timescale for H  I removal is typically less than 0.5  Gyr. Tidal stripping occurs nearly always within 0.5  r200 in halos with [formula], the other mechanisms act also in more massive halos, usually within r200 (see Fig. [\ref=environment_final]). We suggest that satellite-satellite interactions act on much shorter timescales than the other processes, which would explain their relative rarity at any particular redshift. Finally, in about a third of the cases, the H  I stripping could not be unambiguously related to any of the environmental mechanisms analysed.

The next generation of H  I surveys will have the capabilities to corroborate or reject many of the predictions advanced in this study. We stress that the analysis presented here was based on galaxies with [formula], for which the observed and simulated stellar mass functions are in good agreement with each other. The study of the Local Group, however, indicates that the role of the environment is crucial to explain the properties of the faintest galaxies observed. In the future, it will be interesting to extend the analysis presented in this work to the dwarf and ultra-faint dwarf galaxy regimes. The APOSTLE suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations of the Local Group environment [\citep=Sawala+16] [\citep=Fattahi+16] is well suited for this purpose.

Comparing different environment estimators

The definition of environment adopted in this work is based on quantities that describe the local matter density. In cosmological simulations, a commonly adopted way to define the environment of a galaxy is the virial mass M200 of the friends-of-friends group to which that galaxy belongs. This quantity is difficult to measure in real observations, where the environment is often evaluated in terms of galaxy counts or number density. One may wonder how these quantities relate to M200.

We used the EAGLE simulations to investigate the correlation between M200 and three commonly used 'observable' environment estimators: the number N of neighbours within a fixed 2D aperture of 1 Mpc and [formula] in line-of-sight velocity (left panel in Fig. [\ref=Mgroup_vs_env]), the surface density of galaxies Σ7 up to the 7th nearest (in projected distance) neighbour within [formula] in line-of-sight velocity (central panel in Fig. [\ref=Mgroup_vs_env]), and the volume density of galaxies n10 up to the 10th nearest (in 3D distance) neighbour (right panel in Fig. [\ref=Mgroup_vs_env]). These quantities are defined by using neighbours with stellar masses (or absolute magnitude) above a given threshold, thus we show separately two cases adopting either [formula] or [formula]. Lines in Fig. [\ref=Mgroup_vs_env] show the median of the distribution at a given M200, the shaded region brackets the 16th and 84th percentiles. In all cases, there is a monotonic relation between M200 and the other environment estimators, in agreement with the analysis of a SA model by [\citet=Haas+13]. However, the scatter in these relations is large: for instance, a value of 0.5 in log 10(Σ7) may correspond to anything between [formula] and [formula] in virial mass.

It would be interesting to verify whether or not the environmental trends shown in Fig. [\ref=fHI_histogram] are maintained if a) we use one of the observable proxies for the environment rather than the host halo mass; b) we compute the H  I masses as in ALFALFA observations (see sections [\ref=computingHI] and [\ref=fabello]); and c) we include centrals in our analysis. In Fig. [\ref=fHI_histogram_N1Mpc] we show the distribution of log 10MHI  /  M *  for all EAGLE galaxies with [formula] in different bins of stellar mass and environment density N. The bins in N have been arranged in order to have an approximately equal number of galaxies in each bin, regardless of the stellar mass. In general, the environmental trends shown in Fig. [\ref=fHI_histogram_N1Mpc] are similar to those presented by using M200 as an environment proxy: at a fixed M*, H  I-poor galaxies become dominant at large N, while their number decreases with increasing M* at a fixed N (although this is visible mainly for N > 4). The main difference however is that the fraction of H  I-poor systems is severely reduced with respect to Fig. [\ref=fHI_histogram]. This is partially due to the inclusion of centrals, which are virtually never H  I-poor. It is also a consequence of the method adopted to compute the H  I masses, which may now be overestimated given the aperture and velocity range used.

Finally, we stress that M200 does not necessarily provides an optimal definition for the local matter density. Consider a virialized massive group or a cluster of galaxies, for instance. All galaxies in this system share the same host halo mass. However, satellites at the centre of the system experience more ram pressure stripping and tidal interactions than those that reside in the outskirts. Thus, a definition of the environment based on galaxy number counts might be preferable.

Strong and weak convergence tests

In this section we test the numerical convergence of our results. [\citet=Schaye+15] introduced the concepts of 'strong' and 'weak' convergence tests. The former refers to the case where a simulation is re-run at a different resolution by adopting the same sub-grid physics and parameters as the original 'fiducial' run, while the latter refers to the case where the sub-grid physics and parameters are re-calibrated to recover similar agreement with the chosen calibration diagnostics (which in EAGLE are the galaxy stellar mass function and the mass-size relation at z   =   0.1). The EAGLE suite has two high-resolution runs, Ref-L025N0752 and Recal-L025N0752. Both runs use a a box of (25 cMpc)3 and have better spatial and mass resolutions - by factors of 2 and 8 respectively - than the 25 cMpc3 intermediate-resolution run (Ref-L025N0376). Ref-L025N0752 uses the same sub-grid parameter values as the Ref-L025N0376 run and is used for strong convergence tests, while Recal-L025N0752 is the re-calibrated run and is used for weak convergence tests.

We analyse the H  I mass fraction of satellite galaxies as a function of their stellar mass M* and host halo mass M200. Given the smaller volume, here we are limited to a narrower range of stellar and host halo masses and to a much smaller sample of galaxies with respect to the analysis done in section [\ref=predictions]. Therefore, we split our sample of satellites in four bins, determined by whether or not their stellar mass is greater than [formula] and by whether or not they reside in halos more massive than [formula]. As before, we assume a minimum H  I mass of [formula], corresponding to the mass resolution of the Ref-L025N0376 run. In Fig. [\ref=convtest_fHI] we compare the median fHI derived for the four bins in the runs Ref-L025N0376, Ref-L025N0752 and Recal-L025N0752. 1σ error bars are derived by bootstrap resampling the galaxies in each bin. In all cases, the three runs show values of fHI that are consistent with each other and predict a drop in the median fHI with increasing M200. This indicates that the mass resolution of the Ref-L025N0376 run - and therefore of the Ref-L100N1504 run - is adequate to model the physics of the environmental processes. In general, the runs at higher resolution predict slightly larger H  I masses than the intermediate-resolution run, as also shown by [\citet=Bahe+16] and by [\citet=Crain+16].
