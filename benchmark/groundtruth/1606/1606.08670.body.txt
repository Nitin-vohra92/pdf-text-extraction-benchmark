Simplicity of the the first eigenvalue of (p,q) nonlinear elliptic system

Introduction

In recent years the eigenvalue problems for nonlinear elliptic system involving p-Laplace operator has been extensively studied [\cite=NP] [\cite=BF].

Let [formula] be a connected, bounded and open domain with regular boundary ∂Ω. This paper is devoted to show the simplicity of the first eigenfunction (u,v)∈W1,p0(Ω)  ×  W1,q0(Ω) of the following eigenvalue system

[formula]

where p,q  >  1 and α,β > 0 are real numbers satisfying

[formula]

Here [formula] The first eigenvalue λ1(p,q) of system ([\ref=1]) is defined as the least real parameter λ for which both equations of ([\ref=1]) have a nontrivial solution (u,v) in W1,p0(Ω)  ×  W1,q(Ω), where with u,v  ≠  0.

The coupled system ([\ref=1]) has several applications. For instance, in the case where p  >  2, problem ([\ref=1]) appears in the study of non-Newtonian fluids, pseudoplastics for 1  <  p < 2, and in reaction-diffusion problems, flows through porous media, nonlinear elasticity, and glaciology for [formula] We refer the interested readers to [\cite=Diam] for more details.

In [\cite=AMZ] [\cite=KMO] it is shown that the first eigenvalue is simple and corresponding eigenfunction is non negative. Moreover, the stability of the first eigenvalue with respect to (p,q) is established. The proof given in this work is simpler compare with mentioned works.

The first eigenvalue of non linear elliptic system

Consider the following system

[formula]

where p,q  >  1 and α,β > 0 are real numbers satisfying

[formula]

The first eigenvalue λ1(p,q) of ([\ref=3]) is defined as the least real parameter λ for which both equations of ([\ref=3]) have a nontrivial solution (u,v) in the product Sobolev space W1,p0  ×  W1,q0 with u  ≠  0 and v  ≠  0.

Here by a solution to ([\ref=3]) we mean a pair (u,v) such that

[formula]

[formula]

The principal eigenvalue λ1(p,q) can be variationally characterized by minimizing the functional

[formula]

over the set

[formula]

by definition

[formula]

The pair (u,v) is called an eigenvector. Note that that the solutions (u,v) of ([\ref=3]) correspond to the critical points of the energy functional I(u,v).

Let λ1(p,q) be defined by ([\ref=4]), then λ1(p,q) is simple.

Let (u,v) and (φ,ψ) be two normalized vectors of the first eigenfunction associated with λ1(p,q). We show that there exist real numbers k1,k2 such that u = k1φ and v = k2ψ. Our proof is based on proof given by Belloni and Kahwol (see [\cite=BK] for scaler case). Note that the function defined below are admissible functions for problem ([\ref=4]):

[formula]

We have

[formula]

[formula]

Now by Jensen's inequality for convex function θ(  ·  ) = |  ·  |p with

[formula]

choose

Thus the following inequalities hold

[formula]

[formula]

The inequalities above are strict at points where [formula] and [formula] Now we have

[formula]

Note that by concavity we have

[formula]

It is easy to see that u,v,φ,ψ can be chosen such that

[formula]

Then the inequality in ([\ref=f23]) reads as

[formula]

If [formula] and [formula] in a set of positive measure, then we would have strict inequality above, which is contradiction. This shows that u and v also φ and ψ are constant multiplies of each other.
