Spectral descriptors for bulk metallic glasses based on the thermodynamics of competing crystalline phases

Understanding and predicting the formation of multicomponent bulk metallic glasses (BMG) is crucial for fully leveraging their unique combination of superb mechanical properties [\cite=chen2015does] and plastic-like processability [\cite=schroers2006amorphous] [\cite=Schroers_blow_molding_2011] [\cite=kaltenboeck2016shaping] for potential applications [\cite=Johnson_BMG_2009] [\cite=Greer_metallic_glasses_review_2009] [\cite=Schroers_Processing_BMG_2010] [\cite=johnson2016quantifying]. The process underlying the formation of BMGs is still to be fully understood. It involves a multitude of topological fluctuations competing during solidification across many length scales [\cite=kelton1991crystal] [\cite=egami2006formation] [\cite=egami2011atomic] [\cite=ding2014combinatorial]. Long-range processes, required by the typical non-polymorphic nature of the crystallization, and atomic-scale fluctuations, precursors of short-range ordered competing phases [\cite=Busch_kinetics_BMG_2007], are all pitted against each other and against glass formation [\cite=kelton1991crystal] [\cite=kelton2010nucleation] [\cite=kelton1998new]. Simulations of amorphous phases have been attempted to disentangle the mechanism of glass formation [\cite=sheng2006atomic] [\cite=zhang2015glass] [\cite=zhang2015origin] [\cite=lee2003criteria] [\cite=cheng2008relationship] [\cite=cheng2009atomic] [\cite=wang2015asymmetric] [\cite=schoenholz2016structural], within reasonable system sizes, using classical and semi-empirical potentials. Although they have been successful in investigating the influence of factors such as the atomic size and packing on the glass-forming ability (GFA), questions about competing crystalline phases and the dynamics of the process still remain, especially considering all the approximations demanded for performing long molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, adopting ab-initio methods has been challenging: even while the most relevant metastable crystalline phases can be calculated and sorted by their energies [\cite=curtarolo:calphad_2005_monster] [\cite=monsterPGM] [\cite=curtarolo:art67] [\cite=curtarolo:art53], the zero-temperature formalism, lacking vibrational free energy [\cite=curtarolo:art65], and the absence of an underlying lattice on which to build configurational thermodynamics [\cite=deFontaine_ssp_1994] [\cite=curtarolo:art49] make the problem impervious to direct computational analysis.

Descriptors for bulk glass formation -- correlations between the outcome (glass formation) and other material properties, possibly simpler to characterize [\cite=nmatHT] -- have been proposed based on structural [\cite=miracle2004structural] [\cite=wang2015asymmetric] [\cite=cheng2009atomic] [\cite=cheney2009evaluation], thermodynamic [\cite=cheney2009evaluation] [\cite=cheney2007prediction] [\cite=turnbull1969under] [\cite=busch1995thermodynamics] [\cite=lu2002new] [\cite=johnson2016quantifying], kinetic [\cite=turnbull1969under] [\cite=busch1998thermodynamics] and electronic structure considerations [\cite=cheng2009atomic] [\cite=alamgir2000electronic]. A few of these [\cite=lu2002new] [\cite=johnson2016quantifying], have been considerably successful in correlating with the GFA. However, they rely on experimental data, such as the (reduced) glass transition temperatures, that can only be obtained once the glass has been synthesized, and, therefore, cannot be used to make predictions for systems that have not yet been experimentally studied. Consequently, a definite and clear picture for predicting GFA still remains to be found.

In a seminal paper [\cite=greer1993confusion], Greer speculated that "confusion" during crystallization promotes glass formation. However, challenges in a priori knowledge and abilty to quantify such confusion have left this direction mostly unexplored. In this work we propose a definition of this "confusion" based on the following consideration. During quenching, crystal growth will occur whenever fluctuations lead to the formation of a crystalline nucleus larger than a critical size. Therefore, in order to obtain an amorphous solid, the formation of critical size nuclei has to be hampered. We postulate that the existence of multiple phases with very similar energy, implying similar probabilities of being formed, but dissimilar structures, will lead to the formation of several distinct clusters which will intimately compete and thus keep each other from reaching the critical size needed for crystallization. To demonstrate the power of this ansatz, we first characterize confusion by the approximate thermodynamic density of distinct structural phases of metastable states, obtained from ab-initio calculations (Figure [\ref=fig1]), and concurrent GFA measurements by combinatorial synthesis of alloy libraries and high-throughput nanocalorimetry. As test systems, we focus on CuZr and NiZr. Among the known BMGs, CuZr is probably the most broadly studied [\cite=liu2007cooling] [\cite=xu2004bulk] [\cite=wang2004bulk] [\cite=mei2004binary]. NiZr, on the other hand, is known for having poor GFA [\cite=altounian1983crystallization] [\cite=fukunaga2006voronoi]. The contrast between the two glass formers, one strong and one weak, corroborates our ansatz. After having established the efficacy of our approach, we extend it into a robust numerical model for building GFA spectra. This extension establishes the strength of our approach, leading to a descriptor that requires no experimental input and is computationally predictable, unexpensive and quick to calculate.

Carrying out electronic structure ab-initio calculations for the infinite number of available states for a given alloy system is obviously impossible, especially when no lattice model can be built [\cite=deFontaine_ssp_1994] [\cite=curtarolo:art49], as in the case of BMGs. Therefore, we adopt the agnostic approach of exploring structural prototypes mostly observed in nature for these types of systems. The method, shown to be capable of reasonably sampling the phase space and predicting novel compounds [\cite=curtarolo:calphad_2005_monster] [\cite=monsterPGM] [\cite=curtarolo:art67] [\cite=curtarolo:art53] [\cite=curtarolo:art49], is expected to estimate the thermodynamic density of states of an alloy system. We use the binary alloy data available in the AFLOW set of repositories [\cite=curtarolo:art92] [\cite=aflowlibPAPER] to count the number of different structural phases in a given formation enthalpy range as a function of the composition. This data was obtained utilizing the VASP [\cite=kresse_vasp] [\cite=vasp] [\cite=vasp_cms1996] code within the AFLOW computational materials design framework [\cite=curtarolo:art65] [\cite=curtarolo:art104], at the density functional theory level of approximation. The binary alloy systems are fully relaxed in accordance with the AFLOW standard settings [\cite=curtarolo:art104]; which uses the GGA-PBE [\cite=PBE] [\cite=PBE2] exchange-correlation, PAW potentials [\cite=PAW] [\cite=kresse_vasp_paw], at least 6000 k-points per reciprocal atom (KPPRA) and a plane wave cut-off at least 1.4 times the largest value recommended for the VASP potentials of the constituents. The multiple different crystalline phases for each particular stoichiometry are built from the AFLOW library of common prototypes [\cite=curtarolo:art65].

A simple descriptor for glass formation: the entropic factor To quantify the level of disorder associated with an alloy system, we identify the most stable structures and count all of the available phases at the corresponding compositions, ordered by their formation enthalpy difference above the respective ground state, ΔH. This leads to a cumulative distribution of the number of phases, NP(ΔH) (see Figure [\ref=fig2]). We also count the number of different Bravais lattice types, NBL(ΔH), and space groups, NSG(ΔH) among the phases in the distribution. These three quantities are combined into a single heuristic descriptor, called the "entropic factor'', [formula], defined as the cubic root of their product:

[formula]

[formula] should be related to the configurational entropy at a given composition but, by taking into account the different symmetries available to the system, it is more generally representative of the frustration of the crystallization of a single homogeneous crystal structure. Compositions with large [formula] are expected to present structures with more disorder, thus leading to high GFA. In this analysis, the formation enthalpies, Bravais lattices and space groups were determined from the calculated energies and symmetries of the relaxed relevant structures.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed on ingots of CuZr and NiZr alloys prepared by arc-melting the pure elements under an argon atmosphere. The alloys were re-melted and suction cast into a wedge-shaped cavity in a copper mold. The as-cast rods were cut into half along the longitudinal direction and polished to a mirror finish followed by etching. GFA was evaluated by observing the contrast change along the longitudinal direction under a scanning electron microscope . The critical thickness was determined at the transition from featureless contrast to a clearly observable microstructure, as shown in Figure [\ref=fig2]. The crystalline and amorphous structures were further identified by XRD using a Cu-Kα source.

We also synthesized and characterized thin-film samples deposited by magnetron sputtering elementary targets (99.99% pure) inside a vacuum chamber with a base pressure better than [formula] Torr. Sputter deposition results in an effective quenching rate greater than 109 K/s [\cite=liu2014structural], allowing a broad range of alloys to be obtained in the amorphous state.

Nanocalorimetry measurements were performed on thin-film samples of the binary alloys using micromachined calorimetry sensors [\cite=mccluskey2010combinatorial] [\cite=mccluskey2010nano] [\cite=lee2013scanning] [\cite=lee2014low]. The measurements were performed in vacuum at nominal heating rates ranging from 2000 to 8500 K/s, and cooling rates of approximately 5000 K/s. All samples were repeatedly heated to 1300 K to evaluate the crystallization behavior both in the as-deposited state and after melt/quenching. Nanocalorimetry measurements reveal the glass transition, crystallization and liquidus temperatures. These quantities allow us to estimate GFA.

Figures [\ref=fig3](a) and (b) show the nanocalorimetry results for the CuZr binary alloy with compositions in the bulk glass forming region. Each measurement consisted of two thermal cycles in which the thin-film samples were heated to above the melting point and then quenched. All samples show clear signals corresponding to glass transition, crystallization, and melting when first heated from the as-deposited state, indicating that they were deposited in the amorphous state, Figure [\ref=fig3](a). A better glass former has a lower critical cooling rate, so the amount of amorphous phase recovered after melt/quenching should scale with GFA. We observe in Figure [\ref=fig3](a) that the magnitude of the crystallization peak after the first thermal cycle changes significantly with composition: Cu48.5Zr51.5 has the strongest crystallization peak and is thus expected to have the highest GFA among the samples tested; Cu55.5Zr44.5 on the other hand has no discernible crystallization peak. This result is confirmed by calorimetry measurements obtained after cooling from the melted state: the heat released upon solidification results in an exothermic peak in the cooling curve; the magnitude of this peak scales with the amount of crystalline phase formed on quenching and should be inversely proportional to the GFA, Figure [\ref=fig3](b). The experimentally observed number of phases and the amorphous phase thickness obtained from the casting experiments are shown in Figure [\ref=fig3](c). The calculated entropic factor, Figure [\ref=fig3](d), can be compared with these two quantities, and the results show very good agreement between all methods that Cu50Zr50 is the best glass forming composition.

Figure [\ref=fig4] shows similar measurements for the NiZr alloy system, which has been shown to be a weak glass former [\cite=altounian1983crystallization] [\cite=fukunaga2006voronoi]. Although as-deposited samples were amorphous and showed distinct crystallization peaks, subsequent melt/quenching did not produce any amorphous samples, and no crystallization peaks are observed in scans obtained after melting (Figure [\ref=fig4](a)). Instead, we use [formula], defined in Ref. [\cite=lu2002new] and shown in Figure [\ref=fig4](b), as a less direct measure of GFA. Figures [\ref=fig4](b) and (c) show strong correlation between the experimental measurements and the entropic factor descriptor. There is a very weak GFA peak around Ni35Zr65 according to the experimental measurements, which is predicted to be around Ni30Zr70 by the entropic factor. A more pronounced peak is measured around Ni65Zr35, which is also successfully predicted in the same region by the entropic factor descriptor. Thus, the new proposed descriptor correlates well with the traditional empirical indicators of glass formation in metallic alloys, with an accuracy of the order of 5% in composition, which is quite satisfactory. In addition, comparing Figures [\ref=fig3](c) and [\ref=fig4](c), it is clear that the entropic factor exhibited by the high GFA alloy CuZr is significantly higher than that shown by the low GFA NiZr alloy, thus correctly pointing out the more favorable alloy system for glass formation. These results validate our ansatz and show that crystalline phase data can be used in order to predict the formation of amorphous phases.

Descriptor for Glass Forming Ability.

Following this demonstration of the promise of our characterization of structural confusion, we proceed to enhance it into a broader and more quantitative model. This requires several steps: the ansatz is that the presence of highly dissimilar structures with very similar enthalpy correlates with GFA and the descriptor should contain factors describing enthalpy proximity (I.), structural similarity (II.) and appropriate normalizations (III.). Once the descriptor is defined (IV.), it will be confronted with experimental results and a threshold will be found self consistently (V.). Finally the formalism will be applied to our online repository AFLOW for appropriate statistical analysis and potential suggestions of glass-forming alloys.

I. Enthalpy proximity. The descriptor should favor states with enthalpy close to the ground state. This is captured by a Boltzmann factor:

[formula]

in which H0 is the lowest enthalpy for a given concentration, and T0 is room temperature. The inclusion of phases with positive formation enthalpy is necessary due to glass formation occurring at higher temperatures, at which higher enthalpy phases become accessible [\cite=widom2015high]. The cut-off value for including positive formation enthalpy phases is taken to be 50 meV ~  600K, of the same order as the glass transition temperature of several metallic glasses.

II. Structure similarity. To correlate properties of structures having different decorations of the underlying lattice, we use a lattice-free formalism, the expansion in local Atomic Environments (AE) [\cite=villars:factors]. The AE of an atom is defined as the polyhedron formed by the atoms present in the neighborhood up to the distance of the maximum gap in the radial distribution function. A given structure has the corresponding AE calculated for each and every unique atom and then is expanded as:

[formula]

where ψ is a vector representing a given atomic structure. In this representation, the scalar product

[formula]

is used to quantify the structural (dis)similarity between two distinct structures. The structural similarity factor is taken as an exponential having the maximum when [formula] (structures are dissimilar) and decaying to 0 at [formula] (structures are similar):

[formula]

where θ   =   0.25 is a constant, based on an analysis of the available experimental data and kept constant for the entire study. The multiplicative coefficient is added to take into account the limitation that the exponential is taken with respect to the lowest enthalpy state at a given concentration ψ0, and therefore structural similarity among metastable states needs to be accounted for by taking the average scalar product between metastable structures i and j, [formula], computed over all possible combinations for a given stoichiometry {x}.

III. Normalization is represented by this expression computed for each stoichiometry {x} of a given alloy system:

[formula]

IV. GFA descriptor. Combining Eqns. ([\ref=enthalpy]), ([\ref=morphology]) and ([\ref=normalization]) we generate the GFA descriptor evaluated by summing through structures i at a fixed stoichiometry {x}:

[formula]

A large peak of [formula] is expected to indicate good glass forming ability at a particular concentration {x}.

V. Comparison with experiments and threshold for [formula]. The GFA descriptor [formula] was trained with respect to the available experimental data on binary metallic glasses. This data is scarce and sparse. Usually, only glass forming compositions are reported [\cite=liu2007cooling] [\cite=altounian1983crystallization] [\cite=inoue2004formation] [\cite=klement1960non] [\cite=tanner1979metallic] [\cite=calvo1997structural] [\cite=logan1975structure] [\cite=graczyk1980atomic] [\cite=grzeta1985hydrogen] [\cite=yu2006fabrication] [\cite=leonhardt1999solidification] [\cite=wang2010ni] [\cite=ruppersberg1980observation] [\cite=lewis1976stabilities] [\cite=chen1981structure] [\cite=altounian1985crystallization], hindering the training of the descriptor to determine true-negatives. Equipped with these 16 systems' comparisons, we search for a threshold which is found self-consistently as the lowest value maximizing the ratio "peak hits versus misses" without increasing the number of false positives. The threshold is found to be [formula]. Figures [\ref=fig5] (a)-(f) show six binary examples comparing the predicted glass-forming compositions versus known experimental ones (arbitrarily assigned the highest descriptor value obtained for each corresponding system). The systems are CuZr [\cite=liu2007cooling] [\cite=mei2004binary] [\cite=wang2004bulk] [\cite=xu2004bulk] [\cite=li2008matching], NiZr [\cite=altounian1983crystallization], CuHf [\cite=inoue2004formation] [\cite=xia2006glass] [\cite=figueroa2013metallic], AuSi [\cite=klement1960non], BeTi [\cite=tanner1979metallic], and NiP [\cite=calvo1997structural]. When [formula] we claim the existence of a glassy phase. As mentioned earlier, CuZr is probably the most studied binary metallic glass, due to its high GFA and accessible constituent materials. Figure [\ref=fig5] (a) compares our prediction with the experimentally reported glass forming compositions of Cu50Zr50, Cu56Zr44 and Cu64Zr36 [\cite=liu2007cooling] [\cite=li2008matching] [\cite=mei2004binary] [\cite=wang2004bulk] [\cite=xu2004bulk], showing good agreement. For the CuHf alloy system, a glass forming range is reported in Cu1 - xHfx between 0.35 < x < 0.60 [\cite=inoue2004formation] [\cite=xia2006glass] [\cite=figueroa2013metallic]. As shown in Figure [\ref=fig5](c), we only register peaks at the extremes of this range, possibly suggesting a two glass coexistence in that composition range. Overall, of the 16 systems we analyze, 15 are correctly identified as glass-formers with our descriptor (reliability ~   94%). However not all of the peaks are reproduced. Out of the 26 peaks available in the 16 systems, 19 are found (reliability ~   73%). Qualitatively the predicted concentrations are always close to the experimental values but due to the finite set of compositions spanned and the limited number of structures at each composition in our AFLOW repository, they are not strictly accurate. Figure [\ref=fig5](g) shows the correlation between predicted and reported concentrations, which is quite good, with a root mean square deviation of 5.4% for the successfully predicted ones. . Table [\ref=GFAtable] lists the systems and compositions used for the development of [formula].

Looking for new glass formers. The AFLOW repository, containing a total of 1418 binary systems characterized by more then 330,000+ appropriate structural entries, was screened using the new descriptor. The calculated [formula] spectra for all of the binaries are summarized in Figure [\ref=fig5](h). In brevis, the histogram of the maxima of [formula] shows that most of the systems, ~  52% (739 over 1418), are below the threshold and therefore expected to be non-glass formers. However, there are still many, ~  48% (679), above the threshold and therefore potential glass-forming systems. In particular ~  17% (242) have [formula] higher than the known good glass-former CuZr, and hence are highly plausible candidates for metallic glass-formers. The magnitude and sharpness of [formula] lead us to suggest the systems listed in Table [\ref=PredictTable] for further experimental validation.

Overall, our analysis implies that the existence of metallic glass phases could be a very common phenomenon in nature and that the missed experimental observations would be mostly due to the difficulty in achieving the appropriate quenching rates and/or in the choice of compositions. For addressing the latter problem, the rational interrogation of online repositories through carefully-trained heuristic descriptors that capture the physical essence of the problem could become the long sought quantum leap in the field.

Conclusion

We propose a novel predictor for metallic glass formation that is based on the structural and thermodynamic properties of competing crystalline phases which we calculate from first principles. This predictor stems from the concept that competition between energetically-similar crystalline phases frustrates crystallization and thus promotes glass formation. It was developed into a robust numerical descriptor using formation enthalpies and structural similarity measures based on atomic environments. Detailed nanocalorimetry experiments verify the validity of this approach for two model systems, CuZr and NiZr. The non-reliance on experimental data allows for the construction of GFA spectra for 1418 different binary alloy systems, by leveraging extensive libraries of computed crystalline phase data such as AFLOW. Our results predict that 17% of binary alloy systems are capable of glassifying, including many whose synthesis has not been previously reported in the literature, suggesting that there is great uncharted potential for new discoveries in this field.

Methods

Calculation of AEs. To discern AEs we generate N  ×  N  ×  N supercells for the structures under consideration, N being odd and larger than or equal to 3. All distances are calculated with respect to the atoms in the central cell and only within a sphere centered on each atom with a radius chosen so as to guarantee that it is always enclosed by the supercell. If less than one hundred neighbors are contained within this sphere then the supercell size is increased in order to meet this requirement. This is done in order to guarantee sufficient sampling as well as to avoid spurious gaps around the edges of the supercell. Exceptions to this rule are considered when either there are two or more gaps are of similar size, or when the AE defined by this rule generates convex polyhedra in which atoms are contained on the faces (instead of exclusively in the vertices). For the first case, two gaps are considered equivalent if they differ by 0.05Å or less. In this case we adopt the gap which defines the smaller AE [\cite=daams_villars:environments_2000]. For the second case, whenever atoms are detected within a surface, the AE is reconstructed using the largest gap which defines an AE smaller than the initial one. After generating an AE, each of its vertices (atoms) are classified by the number and type of different faces (either triangular or quadrilateral) meeting at that point. Finally, an AE is described in terms of the number of each type of vertex [\cite=daams:cubic_environments]. It should be emphasized that, using this classification, slight distortions on the AEs are completely ignored, and thus we account only for significant differences in crystal structures.
