ηc Elastic and Transition Form Factors: Contact Interaction and Algebraic Model

Introduction

The internal dynamics of mesons, orchestrated by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), dictates their observable properties. Electromagnetic elastic (EFF) and transition form factors (TFF) provide important examples. In experiment, these quantities are extracted through the meson interaction with a virtual photon which probes them at different resolution scales. Several experimental set ups such as the BABAR, Belle and the upcoming Belle II and the 12 GeV upgrade of the Jefferson Laboratory hold the potential to measure these form factors for a large range of probing photon virtualities. For example, for the ηc(1S)  →  γγ* transition form factor, BABAR has provided us with results in the range of [formula].

Within the well-established framework of Schwinger-Dyson (SDE) and Bethe-Salpeter equations (BSE), we can investigate the nonperturbative dynamics of the bound states through first principles in the continuum. SDEs for QCD have been extensively applied to deepen our understanding of the light quark [\cite=Jain:1993qh] [\cite=Maris:1997hd] [\cite=Maris:1999nt] and gluon propagators [\cite=Boucaud:2008ky] [\cite=Aguilar:2008xm] [\cite=Pennington:2011xs], quark-gluon and quark-photon interactions [\cite=Chang:2009zb] [\cite=Kizilersu:2009kg] [\cite=Bashir:2011dp] [\cite=Gomez-Rocha:2016cji] [\cite=Aslam:2015nia] [\cite=Bashir:2011ij] [\cite=Bashir:2011vg] [\cite=Bashir:2004hh], meson spectra below the masses of 1 GeV as well as their static and dynamic properties. The form factors for the light mesons through such studies have been reported in the Refs. [\cite=Maris:2000sk] [\cite=Maris:2002mz] [\cite=Bhagwat:2006pu] [\cite=Huber:2008id] [\cite=GutierrezGuerrero:2010md] [\cite=Roberts:2010rn] [\cite=Roberts:2011wy] [\cite=Raya:2015gva].

The problem of heavy meson's static properties has been addressed within a consistent rainbow-ladder (RL) truncation of the SDE-BSE kernels with varying degree of sophistication for the interaction kernels in  [\cite=Jain:1993qh] [\cite=Krassnigg:2004if] [\cite=Bhagwat:2006xi] [\cite=Maris:2005tt] [\cite=Blank:2011ha] [\cite=Maris:2006ea] [\cite=Krassnigg:2009zh] [\cite=Bhagwat:2004hn] [\cite=Souchlas:2010zz] [\cite=Rojas:2014aka] [\cite=Bedolla:2015mpa] [\cite=Fischer:2014cfa] [\cite=Kubrak:2014ela] [\cite=Hilger:2014nma] as well as in the lattice-regularized QCD [\cite=Dudek:2006ej]. Furthermore, within the lattice QCD approach, radiative transitions and two photon decays of charmonium have been computed recently with a satisfactorily agreeable comparison with experimental data [\cite=Dudek:2007zz] [\cite=Dudek:2006ej] [\cite=Dudek:2006ud] [\cite=Druzhinin:2010zza].

The extension of the above program to the form factors of heavy mesons in the SDE-BSE approach is not straightforward. It becomes numerically cumbersome as the quark propagator has to be sampled in a large region of the complex plane. However, a few years ago, a simple alternative model was crafted to have a qualitative guideline to study light meson properties. It was assumed that the quarks interact, not via massless vector-boson exchange, but instead through a symmetry preserving vector-vector contact interaction (CI) [\cite=GutierrezGuerrero:2010md] [\cite=Roberts:2010rn] [\cite=Chen:2012qr] [\cite=Roberts:2011cf] [\cite=Roberts:2011wy]. This interaction is capable of providing a good description of the meson and baryon ground and excited-states masses for light quarks [\cite=GutierrezGuerrero:2010md] [\cite=Roberts:2010rn] [\cite=Chen:2012qr] [\cite=Roberts:2011cf]. The results obtained for the static properties through the CI are also quantitatively comparable to those arrived at by employing sophisticated model interactions which mimic QCD closely [\cite=Bashir:2012fs] [\cite=Eichmann:2008ae] [\cite=Maris:2006ea] [\cite=Cloet:2007pi]. The form factors are expectedly harder but a qualitative guide is important to make comparison and contrast with real QCD predictions and experiment.

In a previous work [\cite=Bedolla:2015mpa], we extended this CI model to the heavy quark sector to obtain the mass spectrum of charmonia and the decay constants for the pseudoscalar and vector channels. In most cases, the agreement achieved with available experimental data was gratifying. The present article applies this model, with exactly the same input parameters, to the computation of form factors associated with the processes ηcγ*  →  ηc and ηc  →  γγ*, namely ηc EFF and its TFF to γγ*, respectively.

In addition to the CI, we also employ an SDE-based algebraic model (AM), introduced in Ref. [\cite=Chang:2013pq] and refined later in Ref. [\cite=Raya:2015gva]. This model was constructed in the light quarks sector to capture both the infrared and ultraviolet dynamics of QCD in a single, simple and algebraically maneuverable formalism. It has been successfully employed to gain insight into the internal nonperturbative dynamics of the charged and neutral pions [\cite=Chang:2013pq] [\cite=Chang:2014lva] [\cite=Mezrag:2014jka] [\cite=Raya:2015gva]. We extend it to the case of ηc, calculating the elastic and transition form factors, as well as the ηc parton distribution amplitude (PDA), achieving remarkable agreement with lattice QCD as well as experiment, whenever possible.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=sec:sde-bse], we present the necessary SDE-BSE tools and ingredients to study mesons and compute the EFF and the TFF of charmonia. We summarize the main features of the CI model for the sake of completeness. We also introduce the AM and present its extension for charmonia. Section [\ref=sec:etac-eff] and Section [\ref=etac-tff] have been dedicated to the computation of ηc EFF and TFF with the CI and AM, providing comparison with lattice QCD, other models and existing experimental results wherever possible. In Section [\ref=sec:PDA], we calculate the ηc PDA through the AM and compare it with the lattice QCD and perturbative calculations. Finally, in Section [\ref=sec:conclusions], we present our conclusions.

The Formalism

Meson bound states appear as poles in a four-point function. The condition for the appearance of such a pole in a particular JPC channel is given by the BSE [\cite=Gross:1993zj] [\cite=Salpeter:1951sz] [\cite=GellMann:1951rw]

[formula]

where χ(q;P) = Sf(q+)ΓH(q;P)Sg(q-); q+ = q + ηP, q- = q - (1 - η)P; p (P) is the relative (total) momentum of the quark-antiquark system; Sf is the f-flavor quark propagator; ΓH(p;P) is the meson Bethe-Salpeter amplitude (BSA), where H specifies the quantum numbers and flavor content of the meson; r,s,t,u represent color, flavor, and spinor indices; and K(p,q;P) is the quark-antiquark scattering kernel. For a comprehensive recent review of the SDE-BSE formalism and its applications to hadron physics, see for example Refs. [\cite=Bashir:2012fs] [\cite=Aznauryan:2012ba].

The f-flavor dressed-quark propagator Sf that enters Eq. ([\ref=eqn:bse]) is obtained as the solution of the quark SDE [\cite=Roberts:2007jh] [\cite=Holl:2006ni] [\cite=Maris:2003vk] [\cite=Alkofer:2000wg]

[formula]

where g is the strong coupling constant, Dμν is the dressed-gluon propagator, Γaν is the dressed-quark-gluon vertex, and mf is the f-flavor current-quark mass. Since the CI, to be defined later, is nonrenormalizable, it is not necessary to introduce any renormalization constant. The chiral limit is obtained by setting mf = 0 [\cite=Roberts:2007jh] [\cite=Holl:2006ni] [\cite=Maris:2003vk].

Both Dμν and Γaν satisfy their own SDE, which in turn are coupled to the equations containing higher n-point functions and so on ad infinitum. Therefore, the quark SDE, Eq. ([\ref=eqn:quark_sde]), is only one of the infinite set of coupled nonlinear integral equations. A tractable problem is defined once we have spelled out our truncation scheme, , once the gluon propagator and the quark-gluon vertex are specified.

The Contact Interaction

It has been shown in Refs. [\cite=GutierrezGuerrero:2010md] [\cite=Roberts:2010rn] [\cite=Chen:2012qr] [\cite=Roberts:2011cf] that a momentum-independent vector×  vector CI is capable of providing a description of light pseudoscalar and vector mesons static properties, quantitatively comparable to that obtained using more refined QCD model interactions [\cite=Bashir:2012fs] [\cite=Eichmann:2008ae] [\cite=Maris:2006ea] [\cite=Cloet:2007pi]. Furthermore, the π and ρ EFF [\cite=GutierrezGuerrero:2010md] [\cite=Roberts:2011wy] and TFF of the π, [\cite=Roberts:2010rn] have also been calculated in this interaction. In a previous work [\cite=Bedolla:2015mpa], we have employed this interaction to evaluate the mass spectrum of charmonia and the decay constants of the pseudoscalar and vector meson channels. In this article, we apply it to the computation of the EFF and TFF of the ηc. Therefore, we use

[formula]

where mg = 800 MeV is a gluon mass scale which is in fact generated dynamically in QCD (see for example Ref. [\cite=Boucaud:2011ug]) and [formula] is a parameter that determines the interaction strength. For the quark-gluon vertex, the rainbow truncation will be used:

[formula]

Once the elements of the kernel in the quark SDE have been specified, we can proceed to generate and analyze its solution. The general form of the f-flavored dressed quark propagator, the solution of Eq. ([\ref=eqn:quark_sde]), can be written in terms of two Lorentz-scalar dressing functions in the following equivalent and convenient forms:

[formula]

In the latter expression, Zf(p2) is known as the wave-function renormalization, and Mf(p2) is the dressed, momentum-dependent quark mass function, which connects current and constituent quark masses [\cite=Roberts:2007jh] [\cite=Holl:2006ni] [\cite=Maris:2003vk].

Using Eqs. ([\ref=eqn:contact_interaction],[\ref=eqn:quark_gluon_vertex_rl]), the quark SDE equation can be written as:

[formula]

The solution of Eq. ([\ref=eqn:quark_sde_contact]) now has the form

[formula]

In other words, for the CI, Zf(p2) = 1 and Mf is momentum independent. It is because the last term on the right-hand side of Eq. ([\ref=eqn:quark_sde_contact]) is independent of the external momentum. The mass Mf is determined as the solution of

[formula]

Since Eq. ([\ref=eqn:const_mass]) is divergent, we must adopt a regularization procedure. We employ the proper time regularization scheme [\cite=Ebert:1996vx] and write

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are, respectively, infrared and ultraviolet regulators. Note that a nonzero value for [formula] implements confinement by ensuring the absence of quark production thresholds [\cite=Roberts:2007ji]. Furthermore, since Eq. ([\ref=eqn:contact_interaction]) does not define a renormalizable theory, [formula] cannot be removed. Instead, it plays a dynamical role and sets the scale for all dimensioned quantities. The importance of an ultraviolet cut-off in Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type models has also been discussed in Refs. [\cite=Farias:2005cr] [\cite=Farias:2006cs]. Thus

[formula]

where

[formula]

and Γ(a,z1,z2) is the generalized incomplete gamma function.

The Axial-Vector Ward-Takahashi Identity

The phenomenological features of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB) in QCD can be understood by means of the axial-vector Ward-Takahashi identity (axWTI). In the chiral limit, it reads

[formula]

The axWTI implies a relationship between the kernel in the BSE, Eq. ([\ref=eqn:bse]), and that in the quark SDE, Eq. ([\ref=eqn:quark_sde]),

[formula]

This relation must be preserved by any viable truncation scheme of the SDE-BSE coupled system, thus constraining the content of the quark-antiquark scattering kernel K(p,q;P) if an essential symmetry of the strong interactions, and its breaking pattern, are to be faithfully reproduced. Satisfying this identity is particularly important when dynamical chiral symmetry breaking dominates the physics.

However, from a practical point of view, Eq. ([\ref=eqn:axialwti_kernels_rels]) provides a way of obtaining the quark-antiquark scattering kernel, given an expression for the quark self-energy Σ. For the CI under study, Eq. ([\ref=eqn:axialwti_kernels_rels]) can be easily satisfied. The resulting expression for the quark-antiquark scattering kernel is the RL truncation. This kernel is the leading-order term in a nonperturbative, symmetry-preserving truncation scheme, which is known and understood to be accurate for the pseudoscalar and vector mesons. Moreover, it guarantees electromagnetic current conservation [\cite=Roberts:2007ji]:

[formula]

where g2Dμν is given by Eq. ([\ref=eqn:contact_interaction]). Using the interaction that we have specified via Eqs. ([\ref=eqn:contact_interaction],[\ref=eqn:quark_gluon_vertex_rl]), the homogeneous BSE for a meson (η = 1) takes a simple form:

[formula]

Since the interaction kernel given in Eq. ([\ref=eqn:bskernel_rl_contact]) does not depend on the external relative momentum for the CI, a symmetry-preserving regularization will yield solutions which are independent of it. With a dependence on the relative momentum not supported by the CI, the general form of the BSA for the pseudoscalar and vector channels is given in Ref. [\cite=LlewellynSmith:1969az]

[formula]

where M = Mc / 2 is a mass scale, with Mc being the solution of Eq. ([\ref=eqn:const_mass_reg]). Results for the physical observables are clearly independent of this choice.

Since the BSE is a homogeneous equation, the BSA has to be normalized by a separate condition. In the RL truncation of the BSE, this condition is

[formula]

at Q = P, with P2 =  - m2H (we choose η = 1) . Equation ([\ref=eqn:RLNorm]) ensures that the residue of the four-point function at the mass pole is unity. Here, ΓH is the normalized BSA and [formula] its charge-conjugated version. For every channel, we will rescale ΓH such that Eq. ([\ref=eqn:RLNorm]) is satisfied. Furthermore, for the vector channel there is an additional factor of 1/3 on the right hand side to account for all three meson polarizations.

Once the BSA has been normalized canonically with Eq. ([\ref=eqn:RLNorm]), we can calculate observables from it. For example, the pseudoscalar leptonic decay constant f0- is defined by

[formula]

Similarly, the vector decay constant f1- is:

[formula]

where m1- is the mass of the vector bound state, and the factor of 3 in the denominator comes from summing over the three polarizations of the spin-1 meson.

A Corollary of the Axial-Vector WTI

There are further non trivial consequences of the axWTI and the CI. They define our regularization procedure, which must maintain

[formula]

where [formula]. This ensures that Eq. ([\ref=eqn:axwti]) is satisfied. Equation ([\ref=eqn:wticorollary]) states that the axWTI is satisfied if, and only if, the model is regularized so as to ensure there are no quadratic or logarithmic divergences. Unsurprisingly, these are the circumstances under which a shift in integration variables is permitted, an operation required in order to prove Eq. ([\ref=eqn:axwti]) [\cite=GutierrezGuerrero:2010md] [\cite=Roberts:2010rn] [\cite=Chen:2012qr] [\cite=Roberts:2011cf]. The constraint given by Eq. ([\ref=eqn:wticorollary]) will be implemented in all our calculations so that Eq. ([\ref=eqn:axwti]) is unequivocally preserved.

The Contact Interaction for Charmonia

In a recent work [\cite=Bedolla:2015mpa], we have developed a CI model for charmonia. The results for the low lying mass spectrum of corresponding mesons are presented in Table [\ref=tab:mcc_all_opt]. They are in excellent agreement with experimental data (with an average percentage error of 1.14%) and, consequently, with the findings of more sophisticated SDE-BSE model calculations [\cite=Blank:2011ha] [\cite=Rojas:2014aka] [\cite=Fischer:2014cfa] [\cite=Kubrak:2014ela] [\cite=Hilger:2014nma] and lattice QCD computations, [\cite=Follana:2006rc] [\cite=Wagner:2013laa]. The fact that a RL truncation with a CI describes the mass spectrum of ground state charmonia so well can be understood in a simple way: since the wave function renormalization and quark mass function are momentum-independent, the heavy-quark-gluon vertex can reasonably be approximated by a bare vertex. The decay constants calculated in [\cite=Bedolla:2015mpa] for the ηc and J / Ψ channels are given in Table [\ref=tab:DecayCNew]. For the pseudoscalar meson, the result is in decent agreement with the lattice QCD result. Though it is not exactly the case for the vector channel, it is one of the best results in such models (see Ref. [\cite=Bedolla:2015mpa] for an extended discussion). Note that the results presented in Tables ([\ref=tab:mcc_all_opt],[\ref=tab:DecayCNew]) correspond to a minimal extension of the CI model developed primarily for the light quarks in [\cite=GutierrezGuerrero:2010md] [\cite=Roberts:2010rn] [\cite=Chen:2012qr] [\cite=Roberts:2011cf]. A naive application of this earlier model to quarkonia yielded unacceptable results. The reason can be traced back to the fact that the decay constant is influenced by the high momentum tails of the dressed-quark propagator and the BSAs  [\cite=Bhagwat:2004hn] [\cite=Maris:1997tm] [\cite=Maris:1999nt]. These tails probe the wave-function of quarkonia at the origin. Contrastingly, the CI yields a constant mass with no perturbative tail for large momenta. Therefore, this artifact of quarkonia had to be built into the model in an alternative manner. Furthermore, we know that, as the masses become higher, mesons become increasingly point-like in configuration space. The closer the quarks get, the weaker is the coupling strength between them. We thus extended the CI model by reducing the effective coupling αIR, accompanied by an appropriate increase in the ultraviolet cutoff. However, we retained the parameters mg and [formula] of the light sector since modern studies of the gluon propagator indicate that in the infrared, the dynamically generated gluon mass scale virtually remains unaffected by the introduction of heavy dynamical quark masses, see for example Refs. [\cite=Ayala:2012pb] [\cite=Bashir:2013zha]. In the subsequent sections, we shall use this extended CI to evaluate the ηc EFF and TFF to γ*γ.

The Algebraic Model for Charmonia

We also consider the following SDE-based algebraic model, with a simple extension to the heavy quark sector:

[formula]

where P2 =  - m2ηc. N plays the role of the canonical normalization condition, Eq. ([\ref=eqn:RLNorm]), M is fixed such that [formula] and σ = mπ / mηc. A small σ suppresses the angular dependence k  ·  P of the BSA, characteristic of heavy mesons, while σ = 1 recovers the SDE-based AM for the pion [\cite=Raya:2015gva].

The parameter ν that appears in Eq. ([\ref=Charmonia-am]) strongly influences the form of the resulting parton distribution amplitude (PDA) [\cite=Raya:2015gva]. For the pion, ν = 1 produces φπ  ~  x(1 - x). This expression is in agreement with the asymptotic QCD prediction. ν =  - 1 / 2 yields [formula], in keeping with a realistic PDA at the hadronic scale [\cite=Chang:2013pq] [\cite=Cloet:2013tta] [\cite=Braun:2006dg]. As the PDA of the pion plays a crucial role in determining the asymptotic behavior of its EFF and the TFF to γ*γ, the AM is an efficient model to encode both its nonperturbative and asymptotic dynamics, as exemplified in Ref. [\cite=Raya:2015gva]. This model has also been used to calculate pion's valence dressed-quark generalized parton distribution (GPD) Hvπ(x,ξ,t) for "skewness" ξ = 0, [\cite=Mezrag:2014jka].

Owing to the above discussion about the form of the pion PDA and its relation to the ν parameter, we fix ν = 1 for the AM to study the ηc, Eq. ([\ref=eqn:algmod]). Once the AM parameters have been fixed, through the values of mηc,fηc, and ν, one can use it to calculate the EFF and TFF for ηc.

Electromagnetic Interaction: The Quark-Photon Vertex

The interaction of a virtual photon with a meson probes its internal structure and dynamics. The impulse approximation allows electromagnetic processes to be described in terms of quark propagators, bound state BSAs, and the quark-photon vertex. In combination with the RL truncation for the quark propagator and vertices, it ensures electromagnetic current conservation [\cite=Hawes:1998bz] [\cite=Maris:1999bh] [\cite=Maris:2000sk] [\cite=Maris:2002na] [\cite=Bhagwat:2006pu]. Phenomenologically, this approximation has proved to be very successful in describing EFF and TFF of light pseudoscalar and vector mesons [\cite=Maris:2000sk] [\cite=Bhagwat:2006pu] [\cite=Maris:2002mz].

The coupling of a photon with the bound state's charged constituent is given by the quark-photon vertex. In addition to being determined by its own SDE, which is highly nontrivial to solve, the quark-photon vertex Γμ(p+,p-;Q) is constrained by the gauge invariance of quantum electrodynamics (QED) through the vector Ward-Takahashi identity (WTI)

[formula]

Preserving this identity, and its Q  →  0 limit, is key to the conservation of electromagnetic current. In our present truncation, the SDE for the quark-photon vertex, consistent with Eq. ([\ref=eqn:bskernel_rl_contact]) (truncated at the RL level), is

[formula]

where q+ = q + Q, and q- = q. Noting that the right-hand-side is independent of the relative momenta, the general form of the quark-photon vertex is

[formula]

where QμγTμ = 0, γTμ  +  γLμ  =  γμ. Furthermore, note that with the usage of Eq. ([\ref=eqn:quark_inverse_contact]) and Eq. ([\ref=eqn:quark_photon_rl]), the vector WTI is trivially obeyed. Moreover, the bare vertex γμ also satisfies the WTI for the contact interaction propagator Eq. ([\ref=eqn:quark_inverse_contact]). However, the bare vertex does not contain vector meson poles, which are relevant for the correct description of the charge interaction radius; see for example [\cite=Maris:1999bh].

Taking appropriate Dirac traces, and using the constraint of Eq. ([\ref=eqn:wticorollary]), which stems from the axWTI, we find PL(Q2) = 1 and

[formula]

where KJ / Ψ is the Bethe-Salpeter bound state kernel in the vector channel, Eq. ([\ref=eqn:vbsagral]), in the present truncation [\cite=Bedolla:2015mpa]. Thus, because of the dressing of the quark-photon vertex, our form factors (EFF and TFF) will have a pole at Q2 =  - m2J / Ψ, where mJ / Ψ is the vector meson mass.

In the computation of the ηc EFF and TFF in the AM, we use the ansatz for the quark-photon vertex as given in Eq. (8) of the Ref. [\cite=Raya:2015gva]. It has earlier been employed successfully in the description of the pion EFF and TFF. Such form is derived through the gauge technique. It satisfies the WTI, is free of kinematic singularities, reduces to the bare vertex in the free-field limit, and has the same Poincaré transformation properties as the bare vertex.

ηc Elastic form factor

Charge-conjugation eigenstates do not have EFF. At the quark-level of a meson, this can be attributed to the equal and opposite charge of the quark and the corresponding antiquark. Nonetheless, by coupling a vector current to the quarks inside, one can measure a "form factor" that gives information about the internal structure of the state.

The ηc meson, analogously to the pion, has only one vector form factor Fηc(Q2), defined by the ηcγ* vertex

[formula]

where Q = Pf - Pi is the momentum of the virtual photon, and Fηc(Q2) is the ηc EFF, the information carrier of the internal electromagnetic structure of the bound state. In our approach, the impulse approximation for the ηcγ* vertex reads

[formula]

where Pi = P - Q / 2 and Pf = P + Q / 2 are the incoming and outgoing meson momenta, respectively, Q = Pf - Pi is the virtual photon momentum, and the distribution of momentum between the constituents such that k1 = k + P - Q / 2 and k2 = k + P + Q / 2. Since the scattering is elastic, P2i = P2f =  - m2H. In terms of P and Q, these constraints are cast as P  ·  Q = 0 and P2 + Q2 / 4 =  - m2H, where mH is the mass of the bound state.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:etacff], we present our results for the ηc EFF, displayed with and without the dressing of the quark-photon vertex. Evidently, this dressing has a negligible effect on the EFF. In other words, in the CI, the heavy-quark-photon vertex is almost the bare one for the Q2 range shown. However, although the time-like sector has not been displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig:etacff], the ηc form factor has a pole at Q2 =  - m2J / Ψ, where mJ / Ψ is the mass of the vector bound state, see Table [\ref=tab:mcc_all_opt]. This is a consequence of dressing the quark-photon vertex appropriately. Our results compare well with the vector meson dominance (VMD) model for [formula] but are harder than the the ones predicted by the lattice QCD. Beyond [formula], the CI EFF starts deviating from the lattice QCD findings by more than 20%. Notice that the lattice QCD curve is a fit to the data [\cite=Dudek:2007zz], computed in the quenched approximation by assuming the form [formula], where β  =  0.480(3) GeV and α =  - 0.046(1) GeV- 2 on the range

[formula]

γγ*  →  ηc Transition Form Factor

The interaction vertex describing the γ*γ  →  ηc transition can be parameterized by just one form factor Gγ*γηc(Q21,Q22), which can be computed from

[formula]

where Q1 and Q2 are the incoming photon momenta, P = Q1 + Q2 is the ηc momentum, and

[formula]

with k1 = k - Q1, k2 = k + Q2, k3 = k, Qc = (2 / 3)e and [formula]. The kinematic constraints are Q21 = Q2, Q22 = 0 and Q1  ·  Q2 =  - (m2ηc + Q2) / 2, where P2 =  - m2ηc, with mηc the ηc mass.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:etactff], we present the CI results for the γ*γ  →  ηc TFF. Although not shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:etactff], the form factor has a pole at Q2 =  - m2J / Ψ, where mJ / Ψ is the mass of the vector bound state. The results compare fairly well with the BABAR data and lattice QCD for low Q2. For this reason, the interaction radius of the transition form factor, defined in Eq. ([\ref=eqn:FFradius]) and tabulated in Table [\ref=tab:etactchargeradius], compares well with the lattice QCD and BABAR findings, as it probes the slope of the TFF for Q2  →  0. However, for intermediate to large Q2, CI provides a harder form factor and the correct asymptotic Q2 behavior is not captured, see also Fig. [\ref=fig:etacQ2tff].

Both the EFF and TFF obtained from the CI and displayed in Figs. ([\ref=fig:etacff],[\ref=fig:etactff]) tend to a constant when Q2  →    ∞  . This is because the quark propagator mass function and BSAs are momentum independent, which is a characteristic of the CI, see Eq. ([\ref=eqn:contact_interaction]). The need thus arises to calculate these objects, and the resulting form factors, with a more realistic interaction, a computation that is underway and will be reported elsewhere.

As this is numerically more demanding, we resort to the AM, defined in Eq. ([\ref=Charmonia-am]). In Figs. ([\ref=fig:etactff],[\ref=fig:etacQ2tff]), the numerical results for Gγγ*ηc and Q2Gγγ*ηc, respectively, contain the plots obtained through employing the AM, Eq. ([\ref=eqn:algmod]), perturbative QCD calculation [\cite=Feldmann:1997te], as well as the BABAR data. As can be seen from these figures, the AM produces results which agree well with experiment for all the range of Q2, where results are available. Moreover, it behaves like 1 / Q2 for large Q2 and matches onto the perturbative QCD limit of the TFF.

ηc Parton Distribution Amplitude

The perturbative calculation of the ηc  →  γγ* TFF in Ref. [\cite=Feldmann:1997te] is based upon a factorization of short- and long-distance physics. In other words, it is a convolution of a hard-scattering amplitude computed perturbatively from QCD and a universal hadronic light-cone wave function. This wave function cannot be determined completely accurately but the ηc decay constant, which probes the wave function at origin, can provide stringent constraints on the latter. On the other hand, the parton distribution amplitude (PDA) is also connected to the wave function, the former being the integration of the latter over the transverse momentum. This interconnection was exploited in [\cite=Feldmann:1997te] to propose the following parametrization for the ηc PDA for all spacelike values of Q2:

[formula]

where Nφ(a) is fixed such that [formula] and x0 = 1 / 2. The conformal limit of this meson parton distribution amplitude φasy(x) = 6x(1 - x) is obtained formally in the limit amηc  →  0).

In Ref. [\cite=Feldmann:1997te], determination of the ηc decay constant suggests the value [formula] for the transverse size parameter. This value is also consistent with the estimates for the charge radius squared or the quark velocity in potential models, [\cite=Buchmuller:1980su]. The behavior of the PDA, Eq. ([\ref=eqn:pda]), plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:etacpda], resembles the theoretically expected and experimentally confirmed behavior of heavy hadron fragmentation functions; see [\cite=Feldmann:1997te] and references therein.

In our current work, we refer to the novel method, developed in [\cite=Chang:2013pq], to compute the meson PDA from the projection onto the light-front of the meson's Poincaré-covariant Bethe-Salpeter wave-function. Carrying out this exercise for the AM, Eq. ([\ref=eqn:algmod]), produces [formula]. Note that the values of a and σ = mπ / mηc, used in defining the AM, are correlated: a small value of σ gives a closer to 1 while a value ≈  1 recovers the PDA of the pion obtained with the AM.

This computation produces plots displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig:etacpda]. In the same figure, we also present the AM result for the PDA, evolved from [formula] to [formula] through the leading-order Efremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage (ERBL) evolution equation, [\cite=Efremov:2009dx] [\cite=Efremov:1979qk] [\cite=Lepage:1979zb] [\cite=Lepage:1980fj]. Interestingly, the AM result is practically indistinguishable from the result of [\cite=Feldmann:1997te]. For the sake of comparison, we also superimpose the result reported in [\cite=Ding:2015rkn], obtained with a sophisticated DCSB-improved SDE truncation (SDE-DB).

Together with the results for the form factors, this analysis essentially means that the SDE-based AM already encodes a reliable description of the ηc meson and that a full numerical calculation with a realistic interaction should reproduce similar results.

Conclusions

We have computed the EFF and the TFF (ηc(1S)  →  γγ*) for the ηc meson, and the corresponding charge radii, in a CI as well as an SDE-BSE formalism inspired AM. Within the CI, we employ the dressing of the quark-photon vertex, consistent with the model truncation and the WTI. It ensures the form factor possesses a vector meson pole at Q2 =  - m2J / Ψ. Since the mass mJ / Ψ is large, the effect of the meson vector pole on the charge radii is very small, i.e., the heavier the meson the closer it is to a point particle. Our CI is based upon a good description of the masses of the ground state in four different channels: pseudo-scalar (ηc(1S)), vector (J / Ψ(1S)), scalar (χc0(1P)) and axial vector (χc1(1P)), as well as the weak decay constants of the ηc(1S) and J / Ψ(1S), and the charge radius of ηc(1S).

For the form factors, expectedly, the CI results agree with QCD based prediction and/or experiments only up to a certain value of the virtual photon momentum transfer Q2. This observation is in line with earlier similar calculations for the π and the ρ,[\cite=GutierrezGuerrero:2010md] [\cite=Roberts:2011wy] [\cite=Roberts:2010rn], where it is argued that the form factors of hadrons in a CI are harder than the real QCD based results. Therefore, for the CI, both form factors tend to a constant for Q2  →    ∞  , which is a consequence of the momentum-independent interaction.

Furthermore, we have also extended an SDE-BSE based AM, proposed for the light quark sector, to study the ηc. We calculate EFF, TFF (ηc(1S)  →  γγ*) and also the ηc PDA with this model. For the EFF, the results are in excellent agreement with the lattice findings for all Q2 available. An extra advantage of the AM is that its simplicity allows us to extend the computation to any desired values of space-like Q2. We show the results till Q2  =  15 GeV2 for the EFF. For the TFF (ηc(1S)  →  γγ*, we calculate the results till Q2  =  50 GeV2. For all the regime of momentum transfer squared Q2, the results match perfectly with the experiment. Moreover, for large Q2, the perturbative QCD limit of [\cite=Feldmann:1997te] is faithfully reproduced.

This essentially means that the AM already gives a good description of the ηc meson and that a full numerical calculation with a realistic interaction should be able to produce similar results. We are currently in the process of extending our work to the sector of bottomonia.
