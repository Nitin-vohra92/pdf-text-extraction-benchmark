Torsion 1-cycles and birational invariant of degree 4

Introduction

In this paper we are interested in a connection between algebraic cycles and birational invariant, or more specifically, a torsion subgroup of the Griffiths group of 1-cycles and a certain cohomology group which can be thought of as a "homology counterpart" of the degree 4 unramified cohomology.

Let X be a smooth complex projective variety of dimension d. Let Griff1(X)  =  CH1(X)hom / A1(X) be the Griffiths group of 1-cycles, the group of 1-cycles homologous to zero modulo algebraic equivalence. Let T1(X)  ⊂  Griff1(X) be the image of torsion 1-cycles which is homologous to zero and whose Abel-Jacobi invariant is also zero. This subtle invariant, measuring deviation of torsion cycles with null Deligne cycle class from A1(X), was first introduced by Voisin [\cite=Vo2]. On the other hand, for an abelian group A, let Hq(A) be the Zariski sheaf on X associated to the presheaf U  ↦  Hq(U,A). The cohomology group Hd - k(X,Hd(A)) is a birational invariant of smooth projective varieties ([\cite=CT-V]) which is somewhat analogous to the k-th unramified cohomology. The natural homomorphism is known to be injective ([\cite=CT-V]). We will relate T1(X) to this quotient group for k = 4.

In order to state our result, recall that the coniveau filtration of [formula] is defined by ([\cite=Gro], [\cite=Gro2], [\cite=B-O]) where W ranges over closed algebraic subsets of X of codimension ≥  r. We will be concerned with the case k = 2d - 3, where there can be only one nontrivial filter: We write and let [formula] be its torsion part. The group Λ(X) gives a proper analogue of Grothendieck's supérieur cohomological invariant ([\cite=Gro] § 9) in degree 2d - 3 (so to say, supérieur homological invariant of degree 3). If his generalized Hodge conjecture ([\cite=Gro2]) holds true in degree 2d - 3, then [formula] can be thought of as measuring defect of its naive integral version.

Let X be a smooth complex projective variety of dimension d. We have a short exact sequence When CH0(X) is supported in dimension [formula], e.g., when X is rationally connected, Λ(X) is finite, T1(X) coincides to Griff1(X), and we have

In § [\ref=sec:nAk(X)] we also describe the n-torsion part [formula] of the group Ap(X) of codimension p cycles algebraically equivalent to zero modulo rational equivalence, for any p. We will deduce an exact sequence (Theorem [\ref=prop:_torsion_A^p(X)_and_H-cohomology]) where Kp is the Zariski sheaf on X associated to the Quillen K-theory (we may also replace it by the Milnor K-theory sheaf).

The interaction between algebraic cycles and birational invariant has been originated from the work of Bloch-Ogus [\cite=B-O], and developed around the nineties by many authors such as Parimala, Colliot-Thélène, Barbieri-Viale, Kahn and others (see, e.g., [\cite=Pa], [\cite=CT1], [\cite=BV1], [\cite=BV2], [\cite=Ka] and references in [\cite=CT1]). In particular, the relationship between degree 3 unramified cohomology H3nr(X) = H0(X,H3) and codimension 2 cycles was extensively studied. After the Bloch-Kato conjecture was proved by Rost-Voevodsky [\cite=Voe], Colliot-Thélène and Voisin [\cite=CT-V] revisited this subject and established a relation between [formula] and the integral Hodge defect of codimension 2 cycles. Voisin [\cite=Vo2] extended this result to the degree 4 unramified cohomology [formula], relating it to T3(X). On the other hand, in [\cite=CT-V] Colliot-Thélène and Voisin also found a relation between the integral Hodge defect of 1-cycles and [formula]. Theorem [\ref=main] is thus the "homology" counterpart of Voisin's interpretation of H4nr, and is the extension of the second theorem of Colliot-Thélène-Voisin to degree 4.

Notation. If A is an abelian group and n > 0 a natural number, we denote A / n = A / nA and [formula]. We write [formula] for the subgroup of torsion elements. If f:A  →  B is a homomorphism, [formula] and [formula] denote its restriction to the respective torsion parts. Whether a sheaf is considered in the Zariski topology or the classical topology will be clear from the context.

Preliminaries

Let X be a smooth complex projective variety of dimension d. Let A be an abelian group, which will be one of [formula], [formula], [formula] or [formula] in the sequel. Let Hq(A) be the Zariski sheaf on Z associated to the presheaf U  ↦  Hq(U,A) defined by the singular cohomology of Zariski open sets. Bloch-Ogus [\cite=B-O] computed the E2 page of Grothendieck's coniveau spectral sequence ([\cite=Gro] § 10) and obtained a spectral sequence which converges to the coniveau filtration of Hk(X,A) and which coincides to the Leray spectral sequence for the natural continuous map Xcl  →  XZar from the classical topology to the Zariski topology. They showed that where NSp(X) = CHp(X) / Ap(X) is the group of codimension p cycles modulo algebraic equivalence. The edge morphism [formula] equals to the cycle map. Note that Hq(A) = 0 for q > d because smooth affine varieties of dimension d have homotopy type of CW complex of real dimension d. Hence we also have Ep,q2 = 0 for q > d. In this way the Bloch-Ogus spectral sequence is confined to the triangle

The group E0,k2 = H0(X,Hk(A)) is usually called the k-th unramified cohomology group with coefficients in A, and denoted by Hknr(X,A). As shown in [\cite=CT1], [\cite=BV2], [\cite=CT-V], for smooth projective X, it is birationally invariant, and also stably invariant, namely [formula]. When [formula], [formula] can be computed in terms of the Galois cohomology of the function field of X (see [\cite=CT1]), which makes [formula] an effective obstruction in the Noether problem.

In this paper we are mainly interested in the cohomology group which sits in the position of "homology counterpart" of Hknr(X,A) in the Bloch-Ogus spectral sequence, that is, It is proven by Colliot-Thélène and Voisin [\cite=CT-V] that this group is also birationally invariant for smooth projective X. (This can also be seen using the blow-up formula in [\cite=BV2]). Furthermore,

The group Hd - k(X,Hd(A)), d =  dim X, is stably invariant.

In [\cite=BV2] Barbieri-Viale proved the general formula Putting q = d + r and p = d + r - k where d =  dim X, we obtain

[formula]

because over X the sheaf Hq' is zero for q' > d.

Although Hd - k(X,Hd(A)) shares a few properties with Hknr(X,A), these two groups may be rather different, and Hd - k(X,Hd(A)) has some defects compared to Hknr(X,A): for example, [formula] may have torsion; cup product is not defined for Hd - k(X,Hd(A)); and currently we do not know how to calculate [formula] in terms of the function field of X. It is well-known that [formula] and [formula] vanish for rationally connected X (cf. Proposition [\ref=H(d-1] [\ref=d)and_H(d-2] [\ref=d)]). According to a conjecture of Voisin, [formula] would also vanish for such X (see [\cite=Vo3] and references therein). By contrast, there are known many examples of rationally connected X for which [formula] or [formula] is nontrivial (cf. [\cite=CT1], [\cite=CT-V]).

Bloch-Srinivas [\cite=B-S] proved that the Zariski sheaf [formula] is torsion-free using Merkurjev-Suslin Theorem [\cite=M-S]. This was generalized to [formula] for arbitrary q by Barbieri-Viale [\cite=BV3] and Colliot-Thélène-Voisin [\cite=CT-V], as a consequence of the Bloch-Kato conjecture proved by Rost-Voevodsky [\cite=Voe]. As a result, we have a short exact sequence of Zariski sheaves ([\cite=CT-V], [\cite=BV1])

[formula]

for every n > 0. Taking cohomology long exact sequence, we obtain

For every [formula] and n > 0 we have an exact sequence

[formula]

For example, when (p,q) = (0,k), this gives On the mirror edge, namely for (p,q) = (d - k,d), we have

[formula]

We remark that the map [formula] in [\eqref=eqn:UCT] is induced from the connecting map in the snake lemma applied to the diagram

[formula]

Here the horizontals are part of the Bloch-Ogus complexes computing the cohomology of [formula] and [formula] (=   the q-th row in the E1 page of the coniveau spectral sequence). The columns are exact by the exactness of [\eqref=eqn:_Hsheaf_torsion-free] for smooth Zariski open sets of [formula].

Colliot-Thélène and Voisin [\cite=CT-V], [\cite=Vo2] studied the sequence [\eqref=eqn:UCT] in the following cases and found connection with algebraic cycles.

(p,q) = (0,3), with the integral Hodge defect Z4(X) for codimension 2 cycles [\cite=CT-V];

(p,q) = (0,4), with the torsion Abel-Jacobi kernel T3(X) in Griff3(X) [\cite=Vo2];

(p,q) = (d - 3,d), with the integral Hodge defect Z2(X) for 1-cycles [\cite=CT-V].

In § [\ref=sec:T1(X)] we will study the case (p,q) = (d - 4,d) and relate it to (still) 1-cycles.

Griffiths group of 1-cycles

Let X be a smooth projective complex variety of dimension d. We consider the Bloch-Ogus spectral sequence in degree [formula]. The situation is somewhat similar (though not identical) to that in degree [formula].

We have an exact sequence

[formula]

Here cl is the cycle map for 1-cycles modulo algebraic equivalence, and the kernel of ei is the coniveau filter [formula] of [formula].

The same exact sequence holds for [formula]-coefficients with NS1(X) replaced by NS1(X) / n.

As illustrated in Figure [\ref=figure:_spectral_sequence],

the only nonzero differential from degree 2d - 3 to 2d - 2 is d2:Ed - 3,d2  →  Ed - 1,d - 12, and there is no nonzero differential from degree 2d - 2 to 2d - 1, so the spectral sequence in degree 2d - 2 degenerates at the E3 page;

similarly, the only nonzero differential from degree 2d - 4 to 2d - 3 is d2:Ed - 4,d2  →  Ed - 2,d - 12, so the spectral sequence in degree 2d - 3 degenerates at the E3 page as well.

The observation (1) gives and (2) gives Join of these two exact sequences gives the desired sequence. Since the Bloch-Ogus spectral sequence converges to the coniveau filtration, the first nontrivial filter [formula] is equal to [formula].

Colliot-Thélène and Voisin [\cite=CT-V] studied the third line of [\eqref=eqn:B-O_deg_-4_to_-2] and found

[formula]

Combining this with [\eqref=eqn:UCT_homology_edge] with k = 3, they obtained the exact sequence

[formula]

On the other hand, the Griffiths group Griff1(X) is the kernel of the cycle map cl and hence equals to the image of [formula] by [\eqref=eqn:B-O_deg_-4_to_-2]. As in § [\ref=sec:intro], let us denote

[formula]

which is a finitely generated abelian group and is isomorphic to by [\eqref=eqn:B-O_deg_-4_to_-2]. Looking the second to third line of [\eqref=eqn:B-O_deg_-4_to_-2], we thus obtain the following description of Griff1(X).

We have an exact sequence

[formula]

In particular, when [formula] holds, we have

This is analogous to Bloch-Ogus' description ([\cite=B-O]) of Griff2(X)

It is known that the three terms in [\eqref=eqn:Griff1] are all birationally invariant for smooth projective X. For [formula] this is proved in [\cite=CT-V]; for the other two terms, this results from the corresponding blow-up formulae: where   →  X is the blow-up along a smooth subvariety Y  ⊂  X of dimension e.

The group Griff1(X) is finitely generated if and only if [formula] is.

Bloch-Srinivas [\cite=B-S] proved that when CH0(X) is supported in dimension [formula], Griff1(X) is a torsion group. Hence in that case, Griff1(X) is finite if and only if [formula] is. By the way, this result of Bloch-Srinivas can also be obtained from [\eqref=eqn:Griff1] and the fact that [formula] is torsion in that case ([\cite=CT-V]), but this reasoning will be roundabout.

The assumption [formula] in the second statement of Proposition [\ref=prop:Griff1_and_H-cohomology] is strong. For example, it holds for complete intersections of dimension [formula] because in that case [formula] is zero. When this assumption holds, we have by Colliot-Thélène-Voisin's exact sequence [\eqref=eqn:H-cohomology_and_Z2_II].

Taking the [formula] long exact sequence for [\eqref=eqn:Griff1] (or equivalently, applying the snake lemma to the multiplication by n on [\eqref=eqn:Griff1]), we obtain a description of the torsion part of Griff1(X).

We have exact sequences

The group [formula] (resp. Griff1(X) / n) is finite if and only if [formula] (resp. [formula]) is.

In the corollary we may also replace [formula] by [formula] thanks to the exact sequence [\eqref=eqn:H-cohomology_and_Z2_II].

Torsion Abel-Jacobi kernel in Griff1(X)

Let J2d - 3(X) be the intermediate Jacobian of X in degree 2d - 3. The algebraic part J2d - 3(X)alg of J2d - 3(X) is defined as the image of the Abel-Jacobi map λalg:A1(X)  →  J2d - 3(X) from A1(X)  ⊂  CH1(X)hom. This is an abelian variety, which corresponds to the sub [formula]-Hodge structure [formula] of [formula] of weight 1. Consider the quotient complex torus The Abel-Jacobi map λ:CH1(X)hom  →  J2d - 3(X) from CH1(X)hom induces a homomorphism λtr:Griff1(X)  →  J2d - 3(X)tr. We consider its restriction to the torsion part The situation is summarized in the commutative diagram The two rows are exact by the divisibility of A1(X) and J2d - 3(X)alg respectively. The homomorphism [formula] remains surjective by the divisibility of Ker(λalg) (see [\cite=Blo1] Lemma 1.4).

Following Voisin [\cite=Vo2], we define As shown by Voisin, T1(X) coincides to the image of [formula] in Griff1(X), which is the definition stated in § [\ref=sec:intro]. This equality can be seen from the snake lemma applied to the above commutative diagram.

We have an exact sequence If CH0(X) is supported in dimension [formula], we have If CH0(X) is supported in dimension [formula], then Λ(X) is finite, T1(X) coincides to Griff1(X), and hence

[formula]

If CH0(X) is supported in dimension [formula], [formula] is torsion by [\cite=CT-V]. Hence it is annihilated when tensored with [formula]. The finiteness of Λ(X) when CH0(X) is supported in dimension [formula] follows by the same argument and [\eqref=eqn:Griff1]. In that case, Griff1(X) is torsion by Bloch-Srinivas [\cite=B-S], and also J2d - 3(X)tr = 0 because [formula], so T1(X) coincides with Griff1(X). We prove the first assertion.

We apply [\eqref=eqn:UCT] and the universal coefficient theorem to the 2nd to 4th terms of [\eqref=eqn:B-O_deg_-4_to_-2] and its [formula]-coefficients version. This gives

[formula]

where all rows and the middle column are exact, and the other two columns are complex. The right column is (up to sign) restriction of the 5th to 7th terms of [\eqref=eqn:B-O_deg_-4_to_-2] to the n-torsion parts. Commutativity at the lower right, saying that the connecting map α of [\eqref=eqn:Bockstein_CD] with (p,q) = (d - 2,d - 1) is translated to the Bockstein homomorphism β via the edge morphisms of the spectral sequence (up to sign), is essentially proved in [\cite=CT-S-S] Proposition 1 (replace μm by [formula], and the Gersten-Quillen complex by the Bloch-Ogus complex with coefficients in [formula]). Commutativity at the upper right, namely compatibility of the connecting map α of [\eqref=eqn:Bockstein_CD] with the d2 differential, holds generally. It can be checked in the following way (we refer to [\cite=CT-H-K] § 1 for the notation): (1) consider the multiplication-by-n and reduction-to-[formula]-coefficients on the whole exact couple [formula] with which the coniveau spectral sequence started; (2) interpolate

[formula]

into the relevant diagram (multiplication-by-n and reduction-to-[formula]-coefficients are omitted); and then (3) run diagram chasing. It turns out that the results of [formula] and [formula] both come from a common element of [\eqref=eqn:center_of_commutativity] with [formula]-coefficients which is to be multiplied by n.

Now we apply the snake lemma to the lower two rows of [\eqref=key_commutative_diagram]. The resulting connecting map [formula] is rewritten as Then the upper side of [\eqref=key_commutative_diagram] induces the commutative diagram Since the middle vertical is surjective by the exactness of the middle column of [\eqref=key_commutative_diagram], the right vertical πn is also surjective. Since πn is restriction of the map [formula] of [\eqref=eqn:B-O_deg_-4_to_-2] to the n-torsion part, its kernel is Thus we obtain Taking direct limit with respect to n, we have where The construction of λ∞ as a connecting map coincides to that of Voisin's map cld - 1,tors,tr in [\cite=Vo2] p.354 (more precisely, its restriction to [formula]). By [\cite=Vo2] Proposition 4.4, we see that [formula] and so [formula]. Finally, our assertion follows by taking direct limit of [\eqref=eqn:UCT_homology_edge] with k = 4.

(1) This proof was inspired by the argument of Voisin [\cite=Vo2] in the H4nr case. On the other hand, if we add the present argument to Voisin's proof, we obtain Since [formula] has no torsion ([\cite=CT-V], [\cite=BV3]), the first term is equal to [formula]. This gives a refinement of Voisin's result.

(2) It seems plausible that the map λn (and hence λ∞) coincides with the connecting map in Proposition [\ref=prop:_mod_n_Griff], but we have not checked this. In this direction Theorem [\ref=thm:main] would follow more directly.

(3) The sequence [\eqref=eqn:main_thm_3] also follows from [\eqref=eqn:Griff1] and the vanishing [formula] for i = 3,4.

In the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] we also obtained a description of the kernel of the "mod n" transcendental Abel-Jacobi map [formula].

We have

This provides a geometric interpretation of [formula] analogous to [\eqref=eqn:H-cohomology_and_Z2_II]. For the sake of completeness let us also describe [formula] for [formula], which are less intriguing.

(1) We have exact sequences

[formula]

[formula]

When X is rationally connected, all three terms in [\eqref=eqn:H(d-2] [\eqref=d)_tor] vanish.

(2) We have This vanishes for rationally connected X.

These are consequences of [\eqref=eqn:UCT_homology_edge] with k = 1,2 and the complete degeneration of the Bloch-Ogus spectral sequence in degree ≥  2d - 1, which gives When X is rationally connected, it is simply connected and so [formula].

If Voisin's conjecture (cf. [\cite=Vo3]) that Z2(X) = 0 for rationally connected X holds true, we have [formula] for such X by [\eqref=eqn:H-cohomology_and_Z2_I]. Then all terms in [\eqref=eqn:H(d-2] [\eqref=d)_mod_n] would vanish as well.

Torsion cycles in Ak(X)

The previous sections dealt with Griff1(X) and its torsion subgroup. In this section, as another application of [\eqref=eqn:UCT], we give a description of the torsion part of Ap(X) in terms of H-cohomology, for arbitrary p. This is independent of § [\ref=sec:Griff1(X)] and § [\ref=sec:T1(X)]. Let Kp be the Zariski sheaf on X associated to the Quillen K-theory.

Let X be a smooth complex projective variety. We have exact sequences

(1) As explained in the proof, we may also replace Kp by the Milnor K-theory sheaf KMp. Indeed, we have Hp - 1(X,Kp)≃Hp - 1(X,KMp).

(2) When p = 2, the second sequence reduces to the famous formula ([\cite=M-S], [\cite=Mu])

We will combine three short exact sequences. Firstly, the (p - 1,p) case of [\eqref=eqn:UCT] gives

[formula]

As explained at [\eqref=eqn:Bockstein_CD], the map [formula] is induced from the boundary map in the snake lemma for the middle and left columns of the diagram

[formula]

Secondly, Colliot-Thélène, Sansuc and Soulé derived an exact sequence ([\cite=CT-S-S] and [\cite=CT0] § 3.2)

[formula]

As explained in [\cite=CT-S-S], [\cite=CT0], the map [formula] is induced from the boundary map in the snake lemma for the middle and left columns of the diagram

[formula]

The upper two rows come from the Gersten-Quillen resolution of Kp (we may replace Kp by KMp because the Gersten resolution has been established also for the Milnor K-theory [\cite=Ke] and KiF = KMiF for [formula]). The columns are exact: the middle comes from the Kummer theory, and the left from the Merkurjev-Suslin theorem [\cite=M-S].

Thirdly, since Ap(X) is divisible, the sequence

[formula]

remains exact.

Combining the three exact sequences [\eqref=eqn:ses_I], [\eqref=eqn:ses_II], [\eqref=eqn:ses_III], we obtain Commutativity at the lower right can be checked by comparing the boundary maps in the snake lemmas for [\eqref=eqn:CD_I] and [\eqref=eqn:CD_II]. They are connected through the map [formula] which is induced from the boundary maps of the exponential sequences on smooth Zariski open sets of [formula]. Now diagram chasing (or the snake lemma) induces vertical morphisms on the left column of this diagram, and shows that it is exact.

By Proposition [\ref=prop:_mod_n_Griff] and Proposition [\ref=prop:_torsion_A^p(X)_and_H-cohomology] with p = d - 1, the torsion part of CH1(X)hom is controlled by the degree 2d - 3 terms in the E2 page of the Bloch-Ogus spectral sequence with [formula]-coefficients.
