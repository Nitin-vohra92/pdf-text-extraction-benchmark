On Kernel of the regulator map

Background and question

Let X be a smooth projective curve over the complex number field [formula]. In 1970s, Bloch constructed the regulator map R: [formula] in several ways. Later, Deligne found a different construction by considering [formula] as the group of line bundles with connections. We recall his construction very briefly as follows.

For x a point on X, we use ix to denote the inclusion x  →  X. The flasque BGQ resolution of K2(OX)

[formula]

shows that H0(K2(OX)) can be computed as [formula]. So we have the exact sequence of groups

[formula]

It's known that there exists the following Gysin exact sequence in topology,

[formula]

where [formula] and S is finite points on X.

The main ingredient to construct the regulator map R: [formula] is the following commutative diagram

[formula]

That is, one constructs a map R: [formula] and use it to deduce the regulator map R: [formula]. We refer the readers to [\cite=Bloch1] and Section 6 in [\cite=Hain] for more details.

This regulator map has nice motivic features and is related with a general program of Bloch-Beilinson conjecture. In this short note, we focus on the following question, see Section 2 in [\cite=GGregulator] for related discussion. To fix notations, for any abelian group M, [formula] denotes the image of M in [formula] in the following.

Conjecture 2.4 in [\cite=GGregulator]. Let [formula] [formula] be the regulator map, then [formula].

This question is very difficult to approach, though it has very simple form. For [formula], this conjecture has been verified by Kerr [\cite=Kerr].

Main results

In this section, we shall define an infinitesimal form of the regulator map R: [formula] and verify its kernel is [formula]. Our approach is inspired by the following result due to Green and Griffiths:

Page 74 and page 125 in [\cite=GGtangentspace]. Let X be a smooth projective curve over [formula], the Cousin flasque resolution of [formula]

[formula]

is the tangent sequence to BGQ flasque resolution of the sheaf K2(OX)

[formula]

In other words, there exists the following commutative diagram

[formula]

It is known that [formula] can be considered as the tangent space to [formula] and the tangent map is given by log: [formula]. This log map induces a map between cohomology groups log: [formula]. With this interpretation, one can consider [formula] as the tangent space to [formula](this is used in [\cite=Bloch1]) and in fact, one has more:

For X a smooth projective curve over [formula], there exists the following commutative diagram

[formula]

where each row is Gysin exact sequence in topology.

The exactness of each row is known in topology, e.g., see page 54-55 in [\cite=Green]. The residue map Res: [formula] is discussed on page 9 in [\cite=Bloch1].

The residue map Res: [formula] can be described via Hodge theory as follows. Let [formula] be finite points on X and let U be the open complement, U  =  X - D. The residue map Res: [formula] induces Res: [formula]. This gives the map Res: [formula], by using the identifications [formula] and [formula].

The commutativity easily follows from the above definitions.

The Cousin flasque resolution of [formula]

[formula]

shows that [formula] can be computed as [formula]. So we have the exact sequence of groups

[formula]

The map ρ has been described in [\cite=GGtangentspace](for [formula] and works similarly here). Working locally in a Zariski open affine neighborhood U, we can write an element [formula] as

[formula]

where [formula] are relatively prime and fi's are irreducible. Set xi  =  {fi  =  0} and let βi denote

[formula]

where lii means to omit the ith term. By abuse of notations, we still use βi to denote the following diagram, where R = Γ(U,OU),

[formula]

[\cite=GGtangentspace]-page 105.

With above notations, ρ can be described as follows:

[formula]

page 71 and page 125 in [\cite=GGtangentspace]. For X a smooth projective curve over [formula] and x a point on X, there exists a residue map

[formula]

which is defined as follows:

Using [formula] to denote the absolute 1-forms with poles of order at most n at x, we define [formula] as the following composition:

[formula]

If ξ is the local uniformizer centered at x, an element of [formula] is represented by the following diagram

[formula]

For such an element, we define [formula].

The following theorem is an infinitesimal form of diagram (1.1):

There exists the following commutative diagram

[formula]

where the map [formula]'s are the natural maps sending [formula] to [formula] and the residue map(horizontal) [formula] is induced by residue map in Hodge theory(explained in Lemma  [\ref=lemma:_tangGysin]).

The map [formula]: [formula] can be described as follows. Let U be open in X, [formula] can be computed as [formula]. Given any element [formula], its image [formula] in [formula] defines an element in [formula].

This map induces [formula]: [formula].

The commutativity can be easily checked.

The map [formula] [formula] is the infinitesimal form of the regulator map R: [formula]. That is, there exist the following commutative diagram

[formula]

The tangent map tan: [formula] is induced by tan: [formula], which is known to be induced by log. The commutativity can be easily checked, e.g., see formula 2.12 on page 14 in [\cite=Bloch1].

Since [formula] has Hodge decomposition [formula] and the map [formula]: [formula] naturally maps [formula] to [formula], so [formula] is the composition [formula]. Hence [formula].

[formula].

There is a natural short exact sequence of sheaves

[formula]

The associated long exact sequence is of the form

[formula]

So the kernel of [formula] can be identified with [formula].

Since the tangent space to [formula] is [formula], this theorem suggests hat Question  [\ref=question:_main] seems reasonable at the infinitesimal level.
