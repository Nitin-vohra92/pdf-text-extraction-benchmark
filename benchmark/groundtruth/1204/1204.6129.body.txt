Experimental Parametric Subharmonic Instability in Stratified Fluids

Internal gravity waves (IGW) result from the balance of inertia and buoyancy forces in a density stratified fluid. Such waves have received a great deal of attention recently because of their relevance and ubiquity in different physical situations: they are believed to be of primary importance as they affect ocean mixing and energy transport [\cite=Kunze]. Although internal gravity waves do not play the dominant role in the evolution of weather and climate, their influence is non-negligible in the dynamics of the atmosphere [\cite=BruceBook]. From a fundamental point of view, these waves are also particularly intriguing. A striking consequence of stratification is an anisotropic dispersion relation relating the frequency to the direction of propagation of the wave and not to the wavelength. This property is also encountered for inertial waves (in presence of rotation) or plasma waves (in presence of a magnetic field). This has unexpected and interesting consequences in the propagation, reflection [\cite=PRLSwinney] or transmission properties of these waves [\cite=PRLManiTom].

Internal waves are known to be inherently unstable due to parametric subharmonic instability (PSI) [\cite=Staquet02]. PSI is a type of resonant triad interaction where nonlinear terms in the equations of motion allow for efficient transfer of energy from large to small length scales where it can be dissipated. The terminology "parametric sub-harmonic" is used because, for inviscid fluids, PSI transfers energy from a primary wave to two recipient waves of half the frequency. As viscosity effects set in, the frequencies of the recipient waves diverge from half the frequency of the primary wave. In previous laboratory experiments, PSI has been qualitatively observed by driving low-order standing modes with plungers on the sides of the container [\cite=Thorpe69], with an oscillating paddle [\cite=McEwan71] [\cite=McEwan1972] or relying on the parametric forcing of the tank [\cite=Benielli98]. For large amplitude forcing, "irregularities" or "traumata" were observed, which led to mixing and overturning. In ref [\cite=McEwan1972], the critical amplitude of the instability has been measured. Quantitative measurements of the growth rate of the instability have never been reported.

We present here experiments performed with a wave generator, which produces sinusoidal vertical modes propagating along a rectangular tank. We measured the growth rate of the instability. This quantity is of paramount importance to single out the major mechanism in dissipation processes, a recently highly debated issue [\cite=Kunze] [\cite=debate] [\cite=debatebis]. We first briefly outline theoretical aspects of this instability, after which the experimental configuration is described. Then we present our experimental results and compare some of them with theoretical predictions.

Theory

Internal waves are characterized by the buoyancy frequency, [formula], in which g is the acceleration of gravity, [formula] the characteristic fluid density and (dρ0  /  dz) the density gradient in the vertical direction z. At large Prandtl number, the 2-D Boussinesq equations of motion can be written as

[formula]

where   =  ρ  -  ρ0 is the perturbation density field, ψ the stream function, J the Jacobian operator and ν the viscosity. Seeking wave solutions with wave number [formula], Eq. ([\ref=Boussinesq]) leads to the inviscid linear dispersion relation for frequency ω,

[formula]

For small amplitudes, it can be assumed that that several waves concurrently exist simply as a linear superposition. In the case of a resonant triad interaction, where three waves satisfy the spatial resonance condition

[formula]

and the temporal resonance condition

[formula]

the nonlinear terms of Eq. ([\ref=Boussinesq]) act as forcing terms transferring energy between the three waves. Each wave must satisfy the dispersion relation ([\ref=dispersion_rel]). A finite amplitude, large length scale, high frequency wave ([formula]) can transfer energy to produce two secondary waves of smaller length scales and lower frequencies, ([formula]) and ([formula]). The instability results from a competition between nonlinear effects and viscous dissipation. The growth is exponential if the amplitude of the secondary waves is initially small compared to the amplitude of the primary wave [\cite=Koudella2006] [\cite=McEwan1977]. In this case, the growth rate is equal to

[formula]

where ψ0 is the amplitude of the stream function of the primary wave, I1 and I2 are the interaction coefficients

[formula]

and i,p,q  =  0,1 or 2 while Ti  =  νκ2i / 2 is the viscous damping factor of the wave i and κ2 = k2 + m2.

Experimental Configuration

A tank, 160 cm long and 17 cm wide, is filled with linearly stratified salt water with constant buoyancy frequency N using the standard double bucket method. A monochromatic vertical mode-1 wave is generated using the wave generator employed in previous experiments [\cite=Gostiaux2007] [\cite=Mercier2010]. The generator is composed of 50 plates moving horizontally to impose the horizontal velocity component of a mode-1, i.e, u(x = 0,z,t) =  - aω0 cos (πz / H) cos (ω0t), H being the water depth, ω0 the excitation frequency and a the amplitude of the oscillation of the plates. The motion of the fluid is captured by the synthetic schlieren technique using a dotted image behind the tank [\cite=Dalziel00]. A camera is used to acquire images of this background at 1.875 frames per second. The CIVx algorithm [\cite=Fincham2000] computes the cross-correlation between the real-time and the t = 0 background images, giving the variation of the horizontal, x(x,z,t) = ∂x(ρ(x,z,t) - ρ0(z)), and vertical, z(x,z,t) = ∂z(ρ(x,z,t) - ρ0(z)), density gradients.

Results

Snapshots of an experimental horizontal density gradient field at different times for a particular experiment are presented in Fig. [\ref=PSI]. At early times, a pure vertical mode-1 wave can be seen propagating to the right away from the wave generator located at x = 0: this is the primary wave. After several frequency periods T (typically 30), this wave is destabilized and two secondary waves appear, with different frequencies and wave numbers from the primary wave. To see these waves more clearly, the horizontal density gradient at later times is filtered at the frequency of the primary wave, ω0 and at the frequencies of the two secondary waves ω1 and ω2. As described below, the frequencies ω1 and ω2 were determined from a power spectrum. The result is shown in Fig. [\ref=PSIbis]. Some of the energy of the primary wave has been transferred to both secondary waves, leading to a decrease in the amplitude of the primary wave (compare the left part of Fig. [\ref=PSI](left) and Fig. [\ref=PSIbis](left)). These two waves have smaller frequency and also smaller wavelength. In agreement with the dispersion relation, which links the frequency to the angle of propagation of the wave, the angle of constant phase is different for the two wavelengths. For the experiment presented in Fig. [\ref=PSI], the three measured frequencies (ω0,ω1,ω2) are equal to (0.95,0.38,0.57)N, attesting that the temporal resonance condition ([\ref=PSItemporal]) is satisfied. To justify that the spatial resonance condition ([\ref=PSIspatial]) is also satisfied, the components of the three wavevectors have to be measured. This is done by extracting the phase of the signal at a given frequency, ω0,1,2t  ±  k0,1,2x  ±  m0,1,2z, using a Hilbert transform [\cite=HilbertTransform]. At a fixed time and x (respectively z), the phase is linear with the position z (resp. x). The component m0,1,2 (resp. k0,1,2) is given by the slope of the linear fit. Within experimental errors, the wave vectors, represented in Fig. [\ref=triad], satisfy the theoretical spatial resonance condition ([\ref=PSIspatial]).

The measured density gradient fields are then analyzed using a time-frequency representation calculated at each spatial point

[formula]

where h is a smoothing Hamming window of energy unity [\cite=Flandrin99]. Good frequency resolution is provided by a large time window h while good time resolution is provided by small time window h. To increase the signal to noise ratio, the data is averaged along a vertical line over the water depth. For large ω0 / N values, the dissipation length is small, so the analysis line is chosen to be close to the generator so that the amplitude is large.

Fig. [\ref=spectra](left) presents the spectra of the density field for four different excitation amplitudes with ω0 = 0.94N. The spectra are obtained using a time window width equal to 100 T to have good frequency resolution. Sx(t,ω) is then averaged over the 10 last periods. Analyzing first the result for the amplitude 0.5 cm, the picture emphasizes a large peak close to N, corresponding to the frequency of the mode-1 wave. A pair of twin peaks are observed, corresponding to secondary waves of frequencies, ω1 and ω2, smaller than ω0.

The amplitude of each wave is then computed using a time-frequency analysis with a time window width equal to 20 T to increase time resolution. The amplitude of the secondary wave of frequency ω1 is presented in Fig. [\ref=spectra](right). After several forcing periods, a steady state for the primary wave is reached. After a time interval, the secondary wave starts to grow and a linear increase of the amplitude on a semilogarithmic plot is observed, confirming exponential growth. The value of the growth rate λ is measured using a linear fit, shown with the dashed lines in Fig. [\ref=spectra](right). The amplitude of the secondary waves eventually saturates.

Comparing the different curves in Fig. [\ref=spectra], one observes that the amplitude has an influence not only on the location but also on the height of the peaks of the secondary waves in the spectrum. If the amplitude of the primary wave is too small, no peaks are visible and therefore no instability is observed during the experiment run time, Trun. This result shows that the growth rate in this particular case has to be smaller than 1 / run. It may also give an indication of the existence of a threshold in amplitude. As the amplitude increases, the distance between the two peaks increases and the instability occurs earlier (after fewer forcing periods) and is stronger, i.e. with a larger growth rate which is in agreement with the theoretical growth rate ([\ref=growthrate]).

Experiments were performed using the same stratification and an amplitude of 0.5 cm for frequencies in the range of 0.9 < ω0 / N < 1. For each experiment, the value of the frequencies of the two secondary waves, ω1 and ω2, and the growth rate λ were measured. Experimental results are presented as a function of the frequency of the primary wave, ω0 / N, in Fig. [\ref=omega]. The sum of the frequencies of the two secondary waves, ω1  +  ω2, is equal to the frequency of the primary wave, ω0, within experimental errors, in agreement with Eq. ([\ref=PSItemporal]). As ω0 / N increases, the distance between the two secondary frequencies is larger. The measured value of the growth rate is presented in Fig. [\ref=omega](right). The growth rate increases to reach a maximum around ω0  =  0.95N and then decreases as ω0 gets closer to N.

To compare quantitatively the experimental results with the theoretical prediction of the growth rate, the value of the amplitude of the mode-1 wave has to be precisely known. The theoretical value of the amplitude of the streamfunction is equal to aω0 / m0. However, the conversion efficiency from the energy of the wavemaker to the energy of the mode-1 is less than unity and depends on experimental conditions [\cite=Mercier2010]. Moreover, as ω0 gets closer to the cut-off frequency, N, the value of the viscous damping increases [\cite=Echeverri09]. Consequently, the efficiency is not the same for all primary frequencies ω0, and the amplitude of the primary wave has to be measured experimentally to compute the theoretical value of the growth rate. It is important to check that the steady-state of the mode-1 wave has been reached. However, the tank being finite in length, the measurement has to be performed before the mode-1 wave reflects back into the measurement area. Then, using a linear polarization relation, the amplitude ψ0 of the stream function at this particular frequency and wave number is ψ0  =  gω0∂x0 / (4k20N2). The theoretical frequency pair (ω1,ω2) of the instability is defined as the one that maximizes the growth rate. Without adjustable parameters, the comparison between experimental and theoretical results, presented in Fig. [\ref=omega], emphasizes a good quantitative agreement.

Conclusions

We have reported the first experimental measurement of the growth rate of parametric subharmonic instability in stratified fluids and we have demonstrated this effect in a systematic set of laboratory experiments allowing careful comparisons with theoretical predictions. In practice, this heavily debated mechanism [\cite=debate] has implications for many geophysical scenarios. Interestingly, although the generation mechanisms of oceanic IGW are quite well understood, the comprehension of the processes by which they dissipate is much more open. Consequently, determining the relative importance of parametric subharmonic instability, among the four recognized dissipation processes [\cite=Kunze], is the next step in furthering our understanding of how internal waves impact ocean mixing. Quantitative measurements of the subsequent mixing together with a fundamental study of wave turbulence would be of high interest.
