Compatible quadratic Poisson brackets related to a family of elliptic curves

Introduction

Two Poisson brackets {  ·  ,  ·  }0 and {  ·  ,  ·  }1 defined on the same finite dimensional vector space are said to be compatible if

[formula]

is a Poisson bracket for any constant u. Note that if {  ·  ,  ·  }u1,...,uk  =  {  ·  ,  ·  }0 + u1{  ·  ,  ·  }1 + ... + uk{  ·  ,  ·  }k is a Poisson bracket for arbitrary u1,...,uk, then all brackets {  ·  ,  ·  }0,...,{  ·  ,  ·  }k are Poisson and pairwise compatible. Compatible Poisson structures play an important role in the theory of integrable systems [\cite=magri] [\cite=bols] and in differential geometry [\cite=gelzah] [\cite=gelzah1]. A lot of examples of compatible Poisson structures are known [\cite=bols]. Most of these are linear in certain coordinates. However, quadratic Poisson structures are also interesting. While the theory of linear Poisson structures is well-understood and possesses a classification theory, the theory of quadratic Poisson algebras is more complicated. If the dimension of a linear space is larger than four, then no classification results for quadratic Poisson structures on this space are available. All known examples can be divided into two classes: rational and elliptic. In the elliptic case structure constants of a Poisson bracket are modular functions of a parameter τ, a modular parameter of an elliptic curve. This elliptic curve appears naturally as a symplectic leaf of this elliptic Poisson structure [\cite=odes].

Let Qn(τ,η) be an associative algebra defined by n generators [formula] and quadratic relations [\cite=odes]

[formula]

for all [formula]. Here θi(z,τ) are θ-functions with characteristics (see Appendix). It is known that for generic η the algebra Qn(τ,η) has the same size of graded components as the polynomial ring [formula]. Moreover, if η = 0, then Qn(τ,η) is isomorphic to [formula]. Therefore, for any fixed τ we have a flat deformation of a polynomial ring. Let qn(τ) be the corresponding Poisson algebra. Symplectic leaves of this Poisson structure are known [\cite=odes]. In particular, the center of this Poisson algebra is generated by one homogeneous polynomial of degree n if n is odd and by two homogeneous polynomials of degree [formula] if n is even.

One can pose the following problems:

Do there exist Poisson structures compatible with the one in qn(τ)?

Construct a maximal number of Poisson structures pairwise compatible and compatible with the one in qn(τ).

It is easy to study these questions in the cases n = 3, ~ 4.

Let n = 3. The Poisson bracket in q3(τ) can be written as

[formula]

where P is a certain homogeneous cubic polynomial in x1,x2,x3 and σ is an arbitrary even permutation. Moreover, this formula defines a Poisson bracket for an arbitrary polynomial P and all these brackets are pairwise compatible. In particular, there exist 10 linearly independent quadratic Poisson brackets because there are 10 linearly independent homogeneous cubic polynomials in 3 variables.

Let n = 4. The Poisson bracket in q4(τ) can be written as

[formula]

where P, ~ R are certain homogeneous quadratic polynomials in x1,...,x4 and σ is an arbitrary even permutation. Moreover, this formula defines a Poisson bracket for arbitrary polynomials P and R. If we fix R and vary P, we obtain an infinite family of pairwise compatible Poisson brackets. In particular, there exist 9 pairwise compatible quadratic Poisson brackets. Indeed, there are 10 quadratic polynomials in 4 variables and P should not be proportional to R.

If n > 4, then the situation is more complicated because the similar construction for qn(τ), n > 4 does not exists. In this paper we construct nine pairwise compatible quadratic Poisson brackets for arbitrary n. A generic linear combination of these Poisson brackets is isomorphic to qn(τ) where τ depends on coefficients in this linear combination. Moreover, we think that this family of Poisson brackets is maximal. We have checked, that for n = 5,6,...,40 there are no quadratic Poisson brackets that are compatible with all our nine Poisson brackets and are linearly independent of them. For these values of n there are no Poisson brackets compatible with all ours that are constant, linear, cubic and quartic.

Let us describe the contents of the paper. In section [\ref=algebraic] we construct nine compatible quadratic Poisson structures on a certain n-dimensional linear space Fn. This construction is slightly different for even and odd n. It is summarized in Remarks 1, 1[formula] and 2, 2[formula] as an algorithm for the computation of Poisson brackets between xi and xj for i,j = 0,2,3,...,n. In section [\ref=functional] we explain the functional version of the same construction. In sections [\ref=cas] we describe symplectic leaves and Casimir elements of our Poisson algebras (see also [\cite=odes] [\cite=od1]). In the Conclusion we outline several open problems. In the Appendix we collect some notations and standard facts about elliptic and θ-functions (see [\cite=ell] [\cite=odes] for details).

Algebraic construction of nine compatible quadratic Poisson brackets

Notations

Our construction of Poisson brackets is slightly different for even and odd n. We will use index ev (resp. od) for objects related to even (resp. odd) n.

Let

[formula]

be arbitrary polynomials of degree not larger then four, three and two correspondingly. Let Fev be a commutative associative algebra defined by generators f, ~ g and the relation

[formula]

Let Fod be a commutative associative algebra defined by generators f, ~ g and the relation

[formula]

Here a0,...,a4,b0,b1,b2,c are constants. Let D be a derivation of Fev and Fod defined on its generators by

[formula]

for Fev and by

[formula]

for Fod.

Let F be either Fev or Fod. It is clear that [formula] is generated by [formula] as an associative algebra. For an arbitrary element h∈F we will use the notations [formula] for the corresponding elements in [formula]. Let [formula] be an element of a field of fractions of [formula] defined by

[formula]

or by

[formula]

These definitions are equivalent by virtue of ([\ref=relev]). Let [formula] be an element of a field of fractions of [formula] defined by

[formula]

or by

[formula]

These definitions are equivalent by virtue of ([\ref=relod]). Note that [formula] for an arbitrary polynomial H. Indeed, [formula].

We define elements x0,x2,x3,x4,...∈F by

[formula]

Let Fn  ⊂  F be an n-dimensional linear space with a basis {x0,x2,x3,...,xn}  =  {x0,xi; ~ 2  ≤  i  ≤  n}. Note that Fn  ⊂  F is not a subalgebra of F. We assume [formula] if n is even and [formula] if n is odd. We will identify S*Fn with a polynomial algebra [formula] in n variables. In particular:

[formula]

Construction in the case of even n

Proposition 1. The following formula

[formula]

defines a quadratic Poisson bracket on the polynomial ring [formula] where n is even. Here φ,ψ∈Fn and {φ,ψ}∈S2Fn. This Poisson bracket is linear with respect to coefficients a0,...,a4,b0,...,b2 of polynomials Pev, ~ Q and, therefore, can be written in the form [formula] where {  ·  ,  ·  }0, ~ {  ·  ,  ·  }i,1, ~ {  ·  ,  ·  }j,2 are pairwise compatible. Therefore, for each even n we have constructed nine compatible quadratic Poisson brackets in n variables.

Proof. The Jacobi identity is a consequence of a functional construction described in the next section. Let us check linearity with respect to coefficients of Pev, ~ Q. Each of φ,ψ∈Fn  ⊂  Fev can be of the form R(f) or R(f)g where R is a polynomial. Therefore, we have three cases:

Case 1. Let φ = R(f), ~ ψ = T(f). We have

[formula]

Case 2. Let φ = R(f), ~ ψ = T(f)g. We have

[formula]

Here we used λev(R(f1)T(f2)g2 - R(f2)T(f1)g1) =

[formula]

Case 3. Let φ = R(f)g, ~ ψ = T(f)g. We have

[formula]

In these computations we use formulas ([\ref=relev]) and ([\ref=derev]) where f,g are replaced by f1,g1 or f2,g2. Note that in each case we obtain an expression for {φ,ψ} that is linear non-homogeneous in Pev, ~ Q and bi-linear non-homogeneous in g1, ~ g2. Using identifications ([\ref=id]) we can write each of these expressions as a quadratic homogeneous polynomial in x0,x2,x3,...,xn with coefficients linear in a0,...,a4,b0,...,b2.

Remark 1. Let us describe an algorithm for the computation of {xi,xj} as a quadratic polynomial in x0,x2,x3,...,xn. One uses the formulas for {φ,ψ} from the proof of the proposition 1 where R(f) = fi, ~ T(f) = fj and Pev, ~ Q are given by ([\ref=pol]). For the computation of {x2i,x2j} the formula of case 1 is used, for the computation of {x2i,x2j + 3} the formula of case 2 is used, and for the computation of {x2i + 3,x2j + 3} the formula of case 3 is used. These formulas give a polynomial in f1, ~ f2, ~ g1, ~ g2 linear in g1, ~ g2. This polynomial is symmetric under transformations f1  ↔  f2, ~ g1  ↔  g2. By using identifications ([\ref=id]) the expressions can be written as a polynomial quadratic in x0,x2,x3,...,xn.

Remark 2. In all cases of the above remark {xi,xj} is linear non-homogeneous with respect to the eight coefficients a0,...,b2 of polynomials Pev, ~ Q. Therefore, nine compatible Poisson brackets can be obtained in the following way:

[formula]

Construction in the case of odd n

Proposition 1[formula]. The following formula

[formula]

defines a quadratic Poisson bracket on the polynomial ring [formula] where n is odd. Here φ,ψ∈Fn and {φ,ψ}∈S2Fn. This Poisson bracket is linear with respect to c and coefficients a0,...,a3,b0,...,b2 of polynomials Pod, ~ Q and, therefore, can be written in the form [formula] where {  ·  ,  ·  }0, ~ {  ·  ,  ·  }i,1, ~ {  ·  ,  ·  }j,2, ~ {  ·  ,  ·  }3 are pairwise compatible. Therefore, for each odd n we have constructed nine compatible quadratic Poisson brackets in n variables.

Proof. The Jacobi identity is a consequence of a functional construction described in the next section. Let us check linearity with respect to c and coefficients of Pod, ~ Q. Each of φ,ψ∈Fn  ⊂  Fev can be of the form R(f) or R(f)g where R is a polynomial. Therefore, we have three cases:

Case 1. Let φ = R(f), ~ ψ = T(f). We have

[formula]

Case 2. Let φ = R(f), ~ ψ = T(f)g. We have

[formula]

Here we used λod(R(f1)T(f2)g2 - R(f2)T(f1)g1) =

[formula]

Case 3. Let φ = R(f)g, ~ ψ = T(f)g. We have

[formula]

In these computations we use formulas ([\ref=relod]) and ([\ref=derod]) where f,g are replaced by f1,g1 or f2,g2. Note that in each case we obtain an expression for {φ,ψ} that is linear non-homogeneous in Pod, ~ Q and bi-linear non-homogeneous in g1, ~ g2. Using identifications ([\ref=id]) we can write each of these expressions as a quadratic homogeneous polynomial in x0,x2,x3,...,xn with coefficients linear in a0,...,a3,b0,...,b2,c.

Remark 1[formula]. Let us describe an algorithm for the computation of {xi,xj} as a quadratic polynomial in x0,x2,x3,...,xn. One uses the formulas for {φ,ψ} from the proof of the proposition 1[formula] where R(f) = fi, ~ T(f) = fj and Pod, ~ Q are given by ([\ref=pol]). For the computation of {x2i,x2j} the formula of case 1 is used, for the computation of {x2i,x2j + 3} the formula of case 2 is used, and for the computation of {x2i + 3,x2j + 3} the formula of case 3 is used. These formulas give a polynomial in f1, ~ f2, ~ g1, ~ g2 linear in g1, ~ g2. This polynomial is symmetric under transformations f1  ↔  f2, ~ g1  ↔  g2. By using identifications ([\ref=id]) the expressions can be written as a polynomial quadratic in x0,x2,x3,...,xn.

Remark 2[formula]. In all cases of the above remark {xi,xj} is linear non-homogeneous with respect to c and the seven coefficients a0,...,b2 of polynomials Pod, ~ Q. Therefore, nine compatible Poisson brackets can be obtained in the following way:

[formula]

Remark 3. If we replace n in the formulas ([\ref=poisev]), ([\ref=poisod]) by an arbitrary constant α, then these formulas still define Poisson brackets on the polynomial algebra [formula]. However, [formula] ⊂   [formula] is closed with respect to these brackets only if α = n.

Functional construction

General constructions

Recall a general construction of associative algebras and Poisson structures [\cite=odes]. Let λ(x,y) be a meromorphic function in two variables. We construct an associative algebra Aλ through:

[formula]

where Fm is the space of symmetric meromorphic functions in m variables and a product [formula] of f∈Fa, ~ g∈Fb is defined by:

[formula]

Note that this formula defines an associative product for an arbitrary function λ and this product is non-commutative if λ is not symmetric. In particular, if [formula], then we obtain a Poisson algebra. Assume μ(x,y) =  - μ(y,x). For f, ~ g∈F1 we get the following formulas for the associative commutative product fg∈F2 and the Poisson bracket:

[formula]

If λ  =  λ(x - y), then the formula for the product can be deformed in the following way:

[formula]

where p is an arbitrary constant. The corresponding formula for the Poisson brackets (if we set p = εα) is:

[formula]

We will need the following generalization of the last formula:

[formula]

Here ν is an arbitrary function. This formula is obtained from the previous one by transformation f  →  κf, ~ g  →  κg, ~ {f,g}  →  κ2{f,g} where [formula].

Note that the algebra Aλ is very large. One can construct associative algebras (and the corresponding Poisson algebras) of a reasonable size by a suitable choice of spaces Fα and function λ. For example, the algebra Qn(τ,η) and the Poisson algebra qn(τ) can be constructed in this way [\cite=odes]. See [\cite=odfeig] for the functional construction of a wider class of Poisson algebras.

The case of even n

It is clear that equation ([\ref=relev]) defines an elliptic curve in [formula] with coordinates f, ~ g. Therefore, one can find elliptic functions f = f(z), ~ g = g(z) such that

[formula]

Moreover, one can assume (see ([\ref=derev]))

[formula]

Note that elliptic functions f(z), ~ g(z) have a form:

[formula]

Here ζ(z,τ) is the Weierstrass elliptic function, τ is a modular parameter and constants c1,...,c8,u,τ are determined by a0,...,b2. There exists an elliptic function in two variables μev(z1,z2) such that

[formula]

[formula]

This function has the form

[formula]

for some constants k1, ~ k2 such that k1 + k2 = 1.

Let Fn be the space of elliptic functions in one variable with periods 1 and τ, holomorphic outside z = 0, ~ u modulo periods and having poles of order not larger than n at z = 0, ~ u. It is clear that {e0(z),e2(z),e3(z),e4(z),...,en(z)} is a basis of the linear space Fn where we define

[formula]

We will identify SmFn with the space of symmetric elliptic functions in m variables {h(z1,...,zm)} holomorphic if zk  ≠  0,u modulo periods and having poles of order not larger than n at zk = 0, ~ u. We construct a bilinear operator {,}:Λ2Fn  →  S2Fn as follows: for φ,ψ∈Fn we set

[formula]

Proposition 2. The formula ([\ref=pois1ev]) defines a Poisson structure on the polynomial algebra S*Fn. This Poisson bracket is linear with respect to coefficients a0,...,a4,b0,...,b2 of polynomials Pev, ~ Q and, therefore, can be written in the form [formula] where {  ·  ,  ·  }0, ~ {  ·  ,  ·  }i,1, ~ {  ·  ,  ·  }j,2 are pairwise compatible. Therefore, for each even n we have constructed nine compatible quadratic Poisson brackets in n variables.

Proof. This is just a reformulation of the Proposition 1. Formula ([\ref=pois1ev]) is a special case of ([\ref=poisgen]) and therefore the Jacobi identity for ([\ref=pois1ev]) is satisfied. One can check straightforwardly that if φ,ψ∈Fn, then {φ,ψ}(z1,z2) given by ([\ref=pois1ev]) is a symmetric elliptic function in two variables z1,z2 having poles of order not larger than n at z1,z2 = 0,u and therefore {φ,ψ}(z1,z2)∈S2Fn.

The case of odd n

It is clear that equation ([\ref=relod]) defines an elliptic curve in [formula] with coordinates f, ~ g. Therefore, one can find elliptic functions f = f(z), ~ g = g(z) such that

[formula]

Moreover, one can assume (see ([\ref=derod]))

[formula]

Note that elliptic functions f(z), ~ g(z) have a form:

[formula]

Here ζ(z,τ) is the Weierstrass elliptic function, τ is a modular parameter and constants c1,...,c7,u,v,τ are determined by a0,...,b2,c. There exists an elliptic function in two variables μod(z1,z2) such that

[formula]

[formula]

This function has the form

[formula]

for some constants k1, ~ k2 such that k1 + k2 = 1.

Let Fn be the space of elliptic functions in one variable with periods 1 and τ, holomorphic outside z = 0, ~ u, ~ v modulo periods and having poles of order not larger than n at z = 0, ~ u and not larger than one at z = v. It is clear that {e0(z),e2(z),e3(z),e4(z),...,en(z)} is a basis of the linear space Fn where we define

[formula]

We will identify SmFn with the space of symmetric elliptic functions in m variables {h(z1,...,zm)} holomorphic if zk  ≠  0,u,v modulo periods and having poles of order not larger than n at zk = 0, ~ u and not larger than one at zk = v. We construct a bilinear operator {,}:Λ2Fn  →  S2Fn as follows: for φ,ψ∈Fn we set

[formula]

Proposition 2[formula]. The formula ([\ref=pois1od]) defines a Poisson structure on the polynomial algebra S*Fn. This Poisson bracket is linear with respect to c and coefficients a0,...,a3,b0,...,b2 of polynomials Pod, ~ Q and, therefore, can be written in the form [formula] where {  ·  ,  ·  }0, ~ {  ·  ,  ·  }i,1, ~ {  ·  ,  ·  }j,2, ~ {  ·  ,  ·  }3 are pairwise compatible. Therefore, for each odd n we have constructed nine compatible quadratic Poisson brackets in n variables.

Proof. This is just a reformulation of the Proposition 1[formula]. Formula ([\ref=pois1od]) is a special case of ([\ref=poisgen]) and therefore the Jacobi identity for ([\ref=pois1od]) is satisfied. One can check straightforwardly that if φ,ψ∈Fn, then {φ,ψ}(z1,z2) given by ([\ref=pois1od]) is a symmetric elliptic function in two variables z1,z2 having poles of order not larger than n at z1,z2 = 0,u and not larger than one at z1,z2 = v and therefore {φ,ψ}(z1,z2)∈S2Fn.

Symplectic leaves and Casimir elements

For [formula] we denote by bp,n the Poisson algebra spanned by the elements

[formula]

as a linear space, where h is a rational function, fi,gi for each i = 1,...,p are subject to relation ([\ref=relev]) if n is even and ([\ref=relod]) if n is odd where f,g are replaced by fi,gi. In other words, [formula]. A Poisson bracket on bp,n is defined as follows:

[formula]

where i  ≠  j, D is defined by ([\ref=derev]) for even n and ([\ref=derod]) for odd n. We also assume

[formula]

if n is even and

[formula]

if n is odd. Here λi,j,ev (resp. λi,j,od) is given by ([\ref=homev]) (resp. ([\ref=homod])) where f1,g1,f2,g2 are replaced by fi,gi,fj,gj correspondingly. All brackets between fi,gj are zero.

Let us define a linear map φp:Fn  →  bp,n by the formula

[formula]

There is a unique extension of this map to the homomorphism of commutative algebras S*(Fn)  →  bp,n which we also denote by φp.

Proposition 3. The map φp:S*(Fn)  →  bp,n is a homomorphism of Poisson algebras.

Proof. One can check straightforwardly that [formula] where r,s are arbitrary elements from Fn and {r,s}i,j is obtained from [formula] replacing f1,g1,f2,g2 by fi,gi,fj,gj correspondingly. This implies the proposition.

It is known [\cite=odes] [\cite=od1] that if 2p < n, then the map φp defines a 2p dimensional symplectic leaf of the Poisson algebra S*(Fn). Moreover, central elements of the Poisson algebra S*(Fn) belong to ker φp for 2p < n. One can check that for [formula] for even n (resp. [formula] for odd n) the ideal ker φp is generated by two elements of degree [formula] (resp. by one element of degree n). We denote these elements by [formula] if n is even (resp. by Cn if n is odd). The center of the Poisson algebra S*(Fn) is a polynomial algebra generated by [formula] if n is even (resp. by Cn if n is odd). Let us describe these elements explicitly (see also [\cite=od1]).

Let n be even. We define elements [formula] by the formula ([\ref=x]). It is clear that xi∈Frac(Fev) if i = 1, - 1, - 2,... and x0,x2,...,xn∈Fn. If [formula] is even we set

[formula]

and if [formula] is odd

[formula]

In these formulas we use the product in the algebra Frac(Fev) for computing products of vector components. Therefore entries of our matrices of the form vtw are linear combinations of xi∈Frac(Fev), [formula]. On the other hand, for computing determinants we use the product in S*(Frac(Fev)). So these determinants are polynomials of degree [formula] in [formula]. Moreover, it turns out that in our linear combinations of determinants all terms with xi∉{x0,x2,...,xn} cancel out and [formula] are polynomials in x0,x2,...,xn of degree [formula].

Let n be odd. We define elements yi∈Frac(Fod) for [formula] by

[formula]

It is clear that yi∈Frac(Fod) if i = 1, - 1, - 2,... and y0,y2,...,yn∈Fn. Moreover, y0,y2,...,yn can be written as linear combinations of x0,x2,...,xn∈Fn. If [formula] is even we set

[formula]

and if [formula] is odd

[formula]

In these formulas we use the product in the algebra Frac(Fod) for computing products of vector components. Therefore entries of our matrices of the form vtw are linear combinations of yi∈Frac(Fod), [formula]. On the other hand, for computing determinants we use the product in S*(Frac(Fod)). So these determinants are polynomials of degree [formula] in [formula]. Moreover, it turns out that in our linear combinations of determinants all terms with yi∉{y- 2,y0,y2,...,yn} cancel out and [formula] are polynomials in y- 2,y0,y2,...,yn of degree [formula]. These polynomials are linear in y- 2 and therefore can be written as [formula], i = 0,1 where Ai,Bi are polynomials in y0,y2,...,yn. We set Cn = A0B1 - A1B0.

Conclusion

In this paper we have constructed nine pairwise compatible quadratic Poisson structures on a linear space of arbitrary dimension. It seems that this family of Poisson structures is maximal if the dimension of linear space is larger than four. We think that the following problems deserve further investigation:

Study the differential and algebraic geometry of these compatible Poisson structures to explain geometrically why these structures exist and why the number of them is exactly nine.

Do there exist other Poisson structures compatible with the one in qn(τ) where n  ≥  5?

There exist other elliptic Poisson algebras, for example qn,k(τ) where 1  ≤  k < n and n, ~ k are coprime [\cite=odes]. Functional constructions of these Poisson algebras can be found in [\cite=odfeig]. Do there exist Poisson structures compatible with the one in qn,k(τ)? Note that qn,1(τ) = qn(τ), ~ qn,n - 1(τ) is trivial so the first nontrivial example other than qn(τ) is q5,2(τ).

We plan to address these problems elsewhere.

Appendix: Elliptic and θ-functions

Fix [formula] such that Im ~ τ > 0. Let [formula] be an integral lattice generated by 1 and τ. The Weierstrass zeta function is defined as follows:

[formula]

The function ζ(z) is not elliptic but one has ζ(z + ω) = ζ(z) + η(ω) where [formula] is a [formula]-linear function. The functions ζ(z1 - z2) - ζ(z1) + ζ(z2) and [formula] are elliptic. Moreover, a function c1ζ(z - u1) + ... + cmζ(z - um) is elliptic in z if c1 + ... + cm = 0.

Let [formula]. We denote by Θn(τ) the space of the entire functions of one variable satisfying the following relations:

[formula]

It is known [\cite=ell] that dim Θn(τ) = n, every function f∈Θn(τ) has exactly n zeros modulo Γ (counted according to their multiplicities), and the sum of these zeros modulo Γ is equal to zero. Let [formula]. It is clear that θ(z)∈Θn(τ). We have θ(0) = 0 and this is the only zero modulo Γ. Moreover, there exist functions [formula]. These functions are uniquely defined (up to multiplication by a common constant) by the following identities:

[formula]

and form a basis of the linear space Θn(τ).

Note that ζ(z) as well as θ(z), ~ θα(z) are functions in two variables: [formula] and modular parameter τ. Therefore, they can be written as ζ(z,τ) and θ(z,τ), ~ θα(z,τ).
