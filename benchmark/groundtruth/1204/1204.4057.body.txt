A Bernstein type theorem for graphic self-shrinkers with flat normal bundle

Introduction

Let {Mt}T > t > 0 be a family of n dimensional submanifolds in Rn + m and let Ht be the mean curvature vector of Mt in Rn + m, then {Mt}T > t > 0 is said to be moving by mean curvature if

[formula]

Let M be a n dimensional submanifold in Rn + m and NM be its normal bundle. M is said to the a self-shrinker if it satisfies

[formula]

where [formula] is the position vector of Rn + m and [formula] is the normal component of [formula] in NM.

Self-shrinkers are the simplest solutions to the mean curvature flow and they are important in the singularity analysis of the mean curvature flow, see for example [\cite=CM2], [\cite=CM3], [\cite=Hui1] and [\cite=Hui2].

On the other hand, self-shrinkers can be viewed as minimal surfaces endowed with the the weighted metric [formula], see [\cite=Ang], [\cite=CM2] and [\cite=CM3]. In the theory of minimal surfaces the Bernstein theorem for entire minimal graphs played a fundamental role (see, for example [\cite=CM1] and [\cite=Oss]), and so it is nature to ask whether there are Bernstein type theorems for graphic self-shrinkers. Ecker and Huisken proved that n dimensional smooth self-shrinkers in Rn + 1, which are entire graphs and have at most polynomial volume growth, are hyperplanes, in the appendix of [\cite=EH]. The volume growth condition is removed by Wang [\cite=W]. She proved that an n dimensional self-shrinker of entire graph in Rn + 1 has polynomial volume growth by using a calibration argument and a L∞ estimate to the graph function.

In this note, we will prove an Bernstein type theorem for graphic self-shrinkers with flat normal bundles of arbitrary codimension, which generalizes the result of Lu Wang. The main step is to get a stability inequality for the self-shrinker with the weighted measure [formula], by combining the ideas from [\cite=xin] and [\cite=W]. Our theorem is stated as follows.

Let M be an n dimensional graphic self-shrinker in Rn + m with flat normal bundle, then M is a linear subspace.

Comparing to the proof of the Bernstein theorem for minimal graphs with flat normal bundle in [\cite=SWX], our proof of the above theorem is quite simple. The reason is that in our case we can get a "weighted stability inequality"(Lemma [\ref=Stability_inequality]) with weight [formula] for self-shrinkers, and then by the volume growth estimate of Ding and Xin (Theorem [\ref=volume_growth]) the right hand side of the weighted stability inequality tends to zero by choosing appropriate cut off functions.

For other Bernstein type theorems for graphic self-shrinkers, we refer to [\cite=CCY], [\cite=DW], [\cite=DX2], [\cite=DXY] and [\cite=HW].

Preliminaries

Basic equations from submanifold theory

Let [formula] be an isometric immersion with the second fundamental form B, which can be viewed as a section of the vector bundle [formula] over M, where TM and NM are the tangent bundle and normal bundle of M, respectively. Then the second fundamental form, the curvature tensor of the submanifolds, curvature tensor of the normal bundle and that of the ambient manifold, satisfy the Gauss equation, the Codazzi equation, and the Ricci equation, as follows.

[formula]

where {ei} is a local orthonormal frame on M; X,Y,Z∈TM and μ,ν∈NM.

In particular if [formula] is the Euclidean space and M has flat normal bundle, then the Ricci equation will be

[formula]

Volume growth of self-shrinkers

The following theorem estimates the volume growth of self-shrinkers with any codimension ([\cite=DX1]).

Any complete non-compact properly immersed n dimensional self-shrinker M in Rn + m has Euclidean volume growth at most. Precisely, [formula] for [formula], where C is a constant depending on n and the volume of D8n, and [formula], Br is the ball of Rn + m centered at the origin with radius r.

It is proved in [\cite=CZ] that the inverse is also true. That is any complete self-shrinker in Rn + m with Euclidean volume growth must be proper.

Proof of theorem [\ref=main_theorem]

For vectors a1,...,an and b1,...,bn in Rn + m, we let [formula] and [formula] and define their inner product by

[formula]

Let M be an n dimensional complete self-shrinker of Rn + m with flat normal bundle. For a point x∈M we chose an orthonormal frame field {ei,eα} such that ei∈TM and eα∈NM. Fix a n-vector [formula]. We define a function on M by

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

and so

[formula]

Because M is a submanifold in Rn + m with flat normal bundle, by ([\ref=Ricci_equation]) we have

[formula]

and therefore we have

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

and so

[formula]

which implies that

[formula]

Finally we obtain the following formula for ω

[formula]

If ω > 0 on M, then let g =  log ω and g satisfies the following equation

[formula]

We have the following weighted stability inequality

Let M be an n dimensional complete self-shrinker in Rn + m with flat normal bundle. If there is an n-vector A such that the function ω defined by ([\ref=The_function]) is positive everywhere on M, then

[formula]

where η is any function with compact support on M.

Multiplying the equation of g by [formula] and integrating over M gives

[formula]

and the conclusion follows. [formula] Proof of theorem [\ref=main_theorem]: Because M is a graphic submanifold of Rn + m, we can find an n-vector A such that ω is everywhere positive on M. Let [formula], where Br is the ball in Rn + m centered at the origin with radius r > 1, and we choose [formula] to be a function defined on M which equals to 1 on Dr and equals to zero outside Dr + 1, with first derivatives bounded by a constant C independent of r. Then by lemma [\ref=Stability_inequality] we have

[formula]

Let r  →    ∞   and by theorem [\ref=volume_growth] (note that M is a graph in Rn + m, so it is proper) we have [formula], which completes the proof of theorem [\ref=main_theorem].
