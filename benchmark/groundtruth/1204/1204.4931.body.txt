s with order unit

Introduction

The concept of a Segal algebra originated in the work of Reiter, cf. [\cite=RS], on subalgebras of the L1-algebra of a locally compact group. It was generalized to arbitrary Banach algebras by Burnham in [\cite=jB]. A is a Banach algebra A which is continuously embedded as a dense, not necessarily self-adjoint ideal in a . Despite many important examples in analysis, such as the Schatten classes for example, the general structure and properties of s is not well understood. The multiplier algebra and the bidual of self-adjoint s were described in [\cite=fA] [\cite=KR] and, in the presence of an approximate identity, the form of the closed ideals of s was given in [\cite=bB]. Commutative s were studied by Arhippainen and the first-named author in [\cite=AK4].

In this paper, our aim is to develop the basics of a theory of general s, with an emphasis on their order structure. In particular, the notion of an order unit turns out to be crucial. However, in contrast to the case, an order unit of a cannot serve as a multiplicative identity for the algebra. In fact, it emerges that a with an order unit cannot even have an approximate identity (bounded or unbounded). This necessitates developing new approaches, since most results on Segal algebras have been obtained under the assumption of an approximate identity. To this end, we will introduce a notion of "approximate ideal" which, together with the theory of multiplier modules, is used to determine the structure of s which either contain an order unit or to which an order unit can be added in a natural way. Among the basic examples of s with order unit are faithful principal ideals of s.

Section [\ref=sect:irreg-banach] of this paper is of a preliminary nature. We introduce the fundamental concepts and develop basic properties, some of which have been discussed elsewhere in a narrower context. Our purpose here is to prepare the ground for Section [\ref=sect:c*segal] where we devote ourselves to noncommutative s. The main new tools employed are the notion of the approximate ideal (see Definition [\ref=114]) together with the concept of multiplier module (Definition [\ref=121]). Theorem [\ref=211] contains a characterization of self-adjoint s with an order unit whose norm coincides with the order unit norm. So-called weighted s, which provide the noncommutative analogues of Nachbin algebras, are described in Theorem [\ref=214]; they always possess an order unitization (Proposition [\ref=217]).

Irregularity of Banach algebras

In this section, we discuss and analyze Banach algebras which are (possibly non-closed) ideals in a Banach algebra.

Notation and basic definitions

Throughout this paper, let A be a Banach algebra with norm [formula]. A bimodule D over A, in particular, an ideal of A, is called faithful if for each [formula] there are m,n∈D such that [formula] and [formula]. The Banach algebra A is called faithful if it is a faithful bimodule over itself.

The basic notion of this paper is that of the multiplier seminorm, defined on A by

[formula]

It is not difficult to verify that [formula] is an algebra seminorm on A which is a norm if A is faithful. If A has an identity element (denoted by e), then each a∈A satisfies

[formula]

However, in the non-unital case, the interrelations between [formula] and [formula] become more involved. The left-hand inequality remains true for every a∈A, but even if [formula] is a norm, it need not be equivalent to [formula].

Let G be an infinite compact group, and let λ be a Haar measure on it which is normalized such that λ(G) = 1. For 1  ≤  p <   ∞  , denote by Lp(G) the Banach space of (equivalence classes of) complex-valued functions f on G such that

[formula]

With convolution as multiplication, Lp(G) is a Banach algebra. Since every f,g∈Lp(G) satisfy [formula], it follows that, for 1 < p <   ∞  , the multiplier norm on Lp(G) is not equivalent to [formula]. On the other hand, it is well known that the two norms coincide on L1(G).

In order to simplify the subsequent discussion, we introduce some terminology, following [\cite=BD] [\cite=AK3].

The Banach algebra A is called

norm regular if [formula] and [formula] coincide on A;

weakly norm regular if [formula] and [formula] are equivalent on A;

norm irregular if [formula] is strictly stronger than [formula] on A.

Besides the multiplier seminorm, the following family of algebra norms will play a fundamental role in our work. The terminology will be justified shortly.

Let |  ·  | be an algebra norm on A. We call it a Segal norm if there exist strictly positive constants k and l such that

[formula]

for all a∈A.

Segal algebras

Given a Banach algebra B with norm [formula], recall that A is said to be a Segal algebra in B if it is a dense ideal of B and there exists a constant l > 0 such that [formula] for every a∈A. (The second condition is automatically fulfilled if B is semisimple, by [\cite=bB].) For future reference, we record the following standard result of Barnes [\cite=bB]. For other basic properties of Segal algebras, see [\cite=mL] [\cite=RS].

Let B be a Banach algebra in which A is a Segal algebra. Then A is a Banach B-bimodule, i.e., there exists a positive constant l such that

[formula]

for all a∈A and x∈B.

In our context, it is natural to reverse the notion of a Segal algebra as follows.

By a Segal extension of A we mean a pair (B,ι), where

B is a Banach algebra;

ι is a continuous injective homomorphism from A into B;

ι(A) is a dense ideal of B.

Given a Segal extension (B,ι) of A, it is evident that ι(A) becomes a Segal algebra in B when equipped with the norm [formula] for a∈A. Whenever convenient, we shall regard a Segal extension of A as a Banach algebra in which A is a Segal algebra.

The proposition below establishes a useful relation between Segal extensions of A and Segal norms on A. (Here and in the sequel, we identify a normed algebra with its canonical image in its completion.)

The following conditions are equivalent for a Banach algebra B:

B is a Segal extension of A;

B is the completion of A with respect to a Segal norm on A.

(a) ⇒   (b) Lemma [\ref=15] gives a constant l > 0 such that [formula] for all a∈A. Together with the definition of a Segal extension, this means that the restriction of [formula] to A is the desired Segal norm on A.

(b) ⇒   (a) It is enough to prove that A is an ideal of B. Let a∈A and x∈B. Then there is a sequence (an) in A such that [formula]. By Definition [\ref=14], there are positive constants k and l such that [formula] for all a∈A. Since [formula] for every b∈A and

[formula]

it follows that (aan) is a Cauchy sequence in A. Thus, for some b∈A, one has [formula]. From

[formula]

we deduce ax = b and thus A is a right ideal of B. That A is a left ideal of B is proved in a similar way.

In particular, this result shows that norm irregular Banach algebras provide the natural framework for our investigation.

A faithful Banach algebra A is norm irregular if and only if it is a Segal algebra in some Banach algebra. Furthermore, the completion of A under the multiplier norm is a Segal extension of A with the property that any Segal extension of A can be embedded as a dense subalgebra.

The assumption that A is faithful is not needed in proving the "if"-part.

For the remainder of this paper, we shall assume that A is faithful.

The normed algebra [formula] will be denoted by AM and its completion by [formula]. We shall regard every Segal extension of A as a subalgebra of [formula].

Approximate identities of norm irregular Banach algebras

Given a normed algebra B with norm [formula], recall that an approximate identity for B is a net (eα)α∈Ω in B such that [formula] and [formula] for every x∈B. It is said to be bounded if there exists a constant l > 0 such that [formula] for all α∈Ω. Moreover, it is said to be contractive if [formula] for all α∈Ω. In case [formula], it is said to be sequential.

One of the drawbacks of norm irregular Banach algebras is that they cannot possess a bounded approximate identity. Indeed, it is easy to see that if A has a bounded approximate identity (eα)α∈Ω, then each a∈A satisfies [formula], where [formula]. In the context of norm irregular Banach algebras, thus the crucial point turns out to be the existence of a bounded approximate identity with respect to the multiplier norm. In order to make this precise, we first need a simple lemma.

The following conditions are equivalent:

AM has a bounded approximate identity;

[formula] has a bounded approximate identity;

A has a Segal extension with a bounded approximate identity.

The proof is immediate from Proposition [\ref=17] and the fact that a normed algebra has a bounded approximate identity if and only if its completion has a bounded approximate identity (see, e.g., [\cite=pD1]).

Now, consider the set

[formula]

As A is a Banach [formula]-bimodule, we conclude from the Cohen-Hewitt Factorization Theorem [\cite=DB] and part (b) of the previous lemma that [formula] is a closed faithful ideal of A whenever AM has a bounded approximate identity. Its importance lies in the fact that it is the largest closed ideal of A with an approximate identity (necessarily unbounded in the norm irregular case).

Let A be a Banach algebra such that AM has a bounded approximate identity (eα)α∈Ω. Then:

[formula];

[formula];

[formula] has an approximate identity;

every closed ideal of A with an approximate identity is contained in [formula].

(i) It is immediate from Lemma [\ref=15] together with the above discussion of the Cohen-Hewitt Factorization Theorem that the closure of A2 in A coincides with both [formula] and [formula], whence the identity follows.

(ii) In view of (i), the inclusion "⊇  " is evident from the closedness of [formula] in A, and the inclusion "⊆  " follows easily from Lemmas [\ref=15] and [\ref=110](b).

(iii) Noting that the net [formula] is also a bounded approximate identity for AM, and is contained in [formula], the assertion follows from (ii) by replacing [formula] with [formula].

(iv) Given a closed ideal I of A with an approximate identity, the set I2 is dense in it, and the statement follows.

Motivated by this result, we make the following definition.

Let A be a Banach algebra such that AM has a bounded approximate identity. We put [formula] and call it the approximate ideal of A.

Our approach is particularly well suited for the study of Banach algebras having an unbounded approximate identity. That is to say, it is not easy to give an example of a Banach algebra with an approximate identity not bounded in the multiplier norm. In fact, it appears that Willis was the first who constructed such an algebra in [\cite=gW]. Moreover, an application of the Uniform Boundedness Principle yields that if a Banach algebra has a sequential approximate identity, then it is automatically bounded with respect to the multiplier norm; see, for instance, [\cite=pD2].

As a consequence of the above discussion, we have the following factorization results.

Let A be a Banach algebra with an approximate identity bounded under [formula]. Then EA = A.

Let A be a Banach algebra with a sequential approximate identity. Then EA = A.

For 1  ≤  p <   ∞  , denote by [formula] the Banach space of complex-valued sequences x = (xn) such that

[formula]

Under pointwise multiplication, [formula] is a commutative Banach algebra with a sequential approximate identity (e.g., the sequence (en), where en(k) = 1 for every 1  ≤  k  ≤  n, and en(k) = 0 for every k > n). Furthermore, it is not hard to see that the multiplier norm on [formula] coincides with the supremum norm. Together with the preceding corollary and the fact that [formula] is dense in the algebra c0 of complex-valued sequences converging to zero, this yields the well-known factorization property [formula].

We finish this subsection with some useful observations on the approximate ideal.

Let A be a Banach algebra such that AM has a bounded approximate identity, and let B be a Segal extension of A with a bounded approximate identity. Then:

A2 is dense in EA;

AB = BA = EA;

B is a Segal extension of EA.

(i) This was already observed in the proof of Proposition [\ref=113](i).

(ii) Using the Cohen-Hewitt Factorization Theorem again, one deduces that AB and BA are closed ideals of A. The identities now follow from (i) and the inclusions A2  ⊆  AB  ⊆  EA and A2  ⊆  BA  ⊆  EA.

(iii) It is enough to prove that EA is dense in B. But this is immediate from (ii) and the facts that A is dense in B and that B = B2.

For the majority of Segal algebras of interest to us, we have EA  ≠  A. Even in the setting of order unit s discussed in Section [\ref=sect:c*segal], this is the typical situation as is illustrated in Example [\ref=exam:eanota] below.

Multipliers of norm irregular Banach algebras

Multiplier modules will play a central role in this paper, as they allow us to reduce the study of certain properties of A to those of EA. For a general reference on multiplier modules, see [\cite=mR] [\cite=mD].

Let A be a Banach algebra such that AM has a bounded approximate identity, and let B be a Segal extension of A. By a B-multiplier of A we mean a pair m = (ml,mr) of mappings from B into A such that

[formula]

Each a∈A determines a B-multiplier (la,ra) of A given by la(x): = ax and ra(x): = xa for x∈B. We write MB(A) for the set of B-multipliers of A. Let [formula] denote the Banach algebra of bounded linear mappings from B into A; this is indeed an algebra because A is a Segal algebra in B. It is routine to verify that MB(A) is a closed subalgebra of [formula]. In addition, MB(A) carries a natural B-bimodule structure defined by

[formula]

There is a continuous injective algebra and B-bimodule homomorphism φ:A  →  MB(A) given by φ(a): = (la,ra) for a∈A. In case B has a bounded approximate identity, the image of EA under φ is a closed faithful ideal of MB(A).

If A and B coincide, then MB(A) is just the usual multiplier algebra M(A) of A. As mentioned in the Introduction, multiplier algebras of Segal algebras have attracted some attention; see also, e.g., [\cite=hK] [\cite=bT]. However, the drawback in the norm irregular case is that, although they can be considered as faithful ideals of M(A), neither EA nor A is closed in it.

The strict topology on MB(A) is defined by the seminorms

We shall require the following lemma, which can be found in [\cite=ST] and [\cite=mD], for example. (Regrettably, the concept of a faithful module is confused with non-degenerate module in [\cite=mD]; however, our assumptions in the following straighten any ambiguity out.)

Let A be a Banach algebra such that AM has a bounded approximate identity, and let B be a Segal extension of A with a bounded approximate identity. Then:

MB(A) equipped with the strict topology is a complete locally convex algebra;

φ(EA) is strictly dense in MB(A);

if φ is a strictly continuous B-bimodule homomorphism from A into M(B), then it has a unique extension [formula] to a strictly continuous B-bimodule homomorphism of MB(A) into M(B).

As part (i) and part (ii) follow directly from [\cite=ST], we merely add the necessary details to obtain part (iii) from [\cite=mD]. Let ψ be the restriction of φ to EA. Since

[formula]

it follows that ψ is a B-bimodule homomorphism into B. By [\cite=mD], ψ extends uniquely to a strictly continuous B-bimodule homomorphism from MB(EA) into MB(B) = M(B). On the other hand, as the image of every B-multiplier of A is contained in EA, it follows that the sets MB(EA) and MB(A) coincide. Thus, we have a strictly continuous B-bimodule homomorphism [formula]. It remains to show that [formula] extends φ (which we then denote by [formula]). To see this, let a∈A. Then, for all x∈B, we have

[formula]

which implies that [formula] because B is a faithful ideal of M(B).

At the end of this section, we describe a universal property of the multiplier module.

Let A be a Banach algebra such that AM has a bounded approximate identity. Then, for every Segal extension B of A with a bounded approximate identity, (MB(A),φ) satisfies the following conditions:

MB(A) is a faithful B-bimodule;

φ(EA) = MB(A)  ·  B = B  ·  MB(A);

if V is a faithful B-bimodule and φ is an injective B-bimodule homomorphism from A into V such that φ(EA) = V  ·  B = B  ·  V, then there exists a unique injective B-bimodule homomorphism ψ of V into MB(A) such that [formula].

(i) Straightforward.

(ii) In view of Lemma [\ref=120](ii), it is sufficient to show that MB(A)  ·  B is contained in φ(EA). Let m∈MB(A) and x∈B. Then there are y,z∈B such that x = yz. One has m  ·  x = m  ·  yz = (lml(yz),rml(yz)) = (lml(y)z,rml(y)z)∈φ(AB) = φ(EA), as wanted.

(iii) The desired mapping ψ is given by ψ(v): = φv for v∈V, where φv: = (φl,v,φr,v) is such that φl,v(x): = φ- 1(v  ·  x) and φr,v(x): = φ- 1(x  ·  v) for each x∈B.

s

In this section, we develop the basics of a theory of Segal algebras in s, with an emphasis on the order structure. In our main results, Theorems [\ref=211] and [\ref=214], we characterize s with an order unit.

General properties of s

We call A a if it has a Segal extension (C,ι), where C is a . We say A is self-adjoint if ι(A) is closed under the involution of C.

The following lemma shows that the theory developed in the previous section will be applicable in the context of s.

Let A be a in the  C. Then there is a positive constant l such that

[formula]

for all a∈A. Furthermore, AM has a bounded approximate identity which is contractive under the norm on C.

Let l > 0 be as in Lemma [\ref=15] and take a∈A; then

[formula]

From this and the density of A in C it is easy to deduce that [formula] has an extension to an algebra norm [formula] satisfying [formula] for all c∈C. It follows that

[formula]

where the first inequality holds for any algebra norm in the  C, see for example [\cite=cR]. Combining the two estimates above yields the desired inequalities. The second statement is [\cite=DB].

The next two results describe the ideal structure of s. In their proofs, l > 0 designates a constant as in Lemma [\ref=15].

Let A be a in the  C. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

A has an approximate identity;

every closed ideal I of A satisfies [formula], where [formula] denotes the closure of I in C.

For the implication (b) ⇒   (a), it is sufficient to show that EA and A coincide, by Proposition [\ref=113](iii). Since EA is a closed ideal of A and C is its Segal extension, see Lemma [\ref=120](iii), the hypothesis yields that [formula], as desired.

For the implication (a) ⇒   (b), let I be a closed ideal of A and let (eα)α∈Ω be an approximate identity for A. Given [formula] and ε > 0, there exist α∈Ω and y∈I such that [formula] and [formula]. Since yeα∈I and it follows that [formula] is contained in I. The reverse inclusion is trivial.

Let A be a . For every closed ideal I of A, one has:

I is a ;

A / I is a whenever A has an approximate identity.

In particular, I and A / I have an approximate identity whenever A has an approximate identity.

Let (C,ι) be a Segal extension of A and recall that ι(A) is a Segal algebra in C with the norm [formula] for a∈A, see Definition [\ref=16].

Let I be a closed ideal of A, and let J denote the closure of ι(I) in C. To prove (i), it is enough to show that ι(I) is an ideal of C because every closed ideal in a is a as well. Given c∈C and x∈I, there is a sequence (an) in A such that [formula]. Since anx∈I for all [formula] and

[formula]

it follows that cι(x)∈ι(I). In a similar fashion, we see that ι(x)c∈I wherefore ι(I) is an ideal of C, as claimed.

Towards (ii), define κ:A / I  →  C / J by κ(a  +  I): = ι(a)  +  J for a∈A. In view of the commutative diagram below, where the vertical arrows are the quotient mappings, it is routine to verify that κ is a continuous homomorphism with dense image.

[formula]

The injectivity of κ is given by Lemma [\ref=23]. Indeed, take a∈A such that a + I∈ ker κ. Then [formula], so that a∈I and hence a + I = 0.

For the last assertion, it suffices to show that I has an approximate identity. Let (eα)α∈Ω and (fβ)β∈Λ be approximate identities for A and J, respectively. Given x∈I and ε > 0, we find α∈Ω and β∈Λ with [formula] and [formula]. Since ι(eαx)fβ∈ι(I)J = Eι(I) and

[formula]

it follows that Eι(I) is dense in ι(I), whence Eι(I)  =  ι(I).

The following consequence of the above results shows that the constructs of the previous section fit well into the framework of s.

Let A be a in C. Then EA and MC(A) are s as well.

Although a need not be self-adjoint, at present we have no example of a whose approximate ideal is not self-adjoint. However, we have the following result.

Let A be a in C. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

EA is self-adjoint;

MC(A) is self-adjoint.

Moreover, EA is self-adjoint whenever A is self-adjoint.

The implication (b) ⇒   (a) and the last claim are given by Lemma [\ref=120](ii) and Proposition [\ref=124](ii). The implication (a) ⇒   (b) follows from the easily verified fact that the image of every multiplier in MC(A) is contained in EA.

Order structure of s

We now turn our attention to the order structure of s. Let A be a in the  C. The positive cone of A is defined by

[formula]

Let Ah denote the real vector space of self-adjoint elements of A. Then Ah becomes a partially ordered vector space when equipped with the relation

[formula]

An element u∈A+ is called an order unit of A if each x∈Ah satisfies x  ≤  lu for some constant l > 0.

Let X be a locally compact Hausdorff space, and let [formula] be a continuous function such that v(t)  ≥  1 for every t∈X. Define

[formula]

and

[formula]

where C(X) denotes the set of all continuous complex-valued functions on X. Equipped with pointwise operations and the weighted supremum norm

[formula]

Cvb(X) and Cv0(X) are self-adjoint s. In fact, they are examples of the so-called Nachbin algebras; see, e.g., [\cite=lN] [\cite=AK1] [\cite=AK2]. It is easy to see that the function [formula] serves as an order unit for Cvb(X).

The following standard lemma is recorded for completeness.

Let A be a self-adjoint with an order unit. Then

[formula]

Let A be a self-adjoint . Since the involution is continuous on [formula], by [\cite=cR], the norm [formula], a∈A is equivalent to the original norm on A. Thus, replacing [formula] by [formula], we can, and will henceforth, assume without loss of generality that the involution on A is an isometry. Under this hypothesis, we have [formula] for each a∈A, by [\cite=cR], which simplifies the subsequent estimates somewhat.

Every order unit u∈A is strictly positive, that is, ω(u)  >  0 for every positive functional [formula] on A. It follows that u is a strictly positive element of the surrounding C, which is therefore σ-unital; that is, contains a countable contractive approximate identity. E.g., such an approximate identity is given by [formula]. An immediate consequence of this is the following observation.

Let A be a self-adjoint with order unit u. Then, for each c∈C, one has uc = 0 if and only if c = 0.

The following special s are in the focus of our attention.

By an order unit we mean a pair (A,u), where A is a self-adjoint and u is an order unit of A satisfying

[formula]

for all a∈Ah.

We now obtain a characterization of order unit s. In the following, 1 will denote the identity element of M(C).

Let A be a in the C, and let u∈A+ be strictly positive. Put [formula]. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

(A,u) is an order unit ;

there exists a self-adjoint C-subbimodule D of M(C) containing C and 1 such that A = vDv and [formula] for all d∈Dh.

In particular, EA = vCv and MC(A) = vM(C)v whenever (A,u) is an order unit .

For the proof, we need the following result.

With the assumptions and notation as in Theorem [\ref=211], let m∈M(C)h. Then, for l > 0,

[formula]

In particular, [formula] for all m∈M(C)h and thus, if (A,u) is an order unit , [formula] for all a∈Ah.

Let m∈M(C)h and l > 0 be such that - lu  ≤  vmv  ≤  lu. Then each c∈C satisfies

[formula]

so that

[formula]

As v is strictly positive, vC is dense in C, see, for example, [\cite=WO], and hence [formula] for all c∈C. This implies that [formula] which is the right-hand side in [\eqref=eq:order-norms] above.

To prove the first part of the last assertion, first suppose that [formula]. Then which directly yields the claim. For arbitrary m∈M(C)h, put [formula]. Since we obtain [formula] by the above. It follows that

[formula]

and thus [formula].

Since the right-hand side in [\eqref=eq:order-norms] evidently implies the left-hand side, we find that specialising this to a∈Ah and using the definition of the order unit norm we obtain the final assertion.

[formula] Clearly, vCv is a self-adjoint subalgebra of C. By Lemma [\ref=210], we can define a complete *-algebra norm [formula] by setting [formula] for c∈C. The remainder of the proof is divided into seven steps.

Step 1. vCv  ⊆  EA: Let c∈Ch and set

[formula]

Since (un) is a contractive approximate identity for C, we can apply Lemma [\ref=222] to conclude that, for all [formula], whence (xn) is a Cauchy sequence in EA. Since EA is a closed ideal of A, there exists x∈EA such that [formula]. It follows that

[formula]

(see Remark [\ref=rem:star-norm-property]). Therefore, vcv = x and so vChv  ⊆  EA. By the identity C = Ch + iCh, this yields the desired inclusion.

Step 2. vCv is dense in EA: It is sufficient to show that vA2v is dense in EA. Since vC and Cv are dense in C, so are vA and Av, by the density of A in C. Let a,b∈A and ε > 0. Then we find a',b'∈A with

[formula]

where the constant l > 0 is as in Lemma [\ref=15]. It follows that which, together with the density of A2 in EA, see Lemma [\ref=120](i), proves the claim.

Step 3. vCv = EA: In view of the above, it is enough to show that [formula] and [formula] are equivalent on vCv. By Step 1 and Lemma [\ref=222], the two norms agree on the self-adjoint part as The cartesian decomposition of c∈C into its real and imaginary parts thus immediately yields [formula] because both norms are *-norms.

Step 4. Each c∈C determines unique c',c''∈C with cv = vc' and vc = c''v: Let c∈C. Then cu,uc∈EA, so that cu = vc'v and uc = vc''v for some c',c''∈C, by Step 3. An application of Lemma [\ref=210] yields the uniqueness of c' and c'' as well as the desired identities. For example, The uniqueness of the elements c' and c'' yields

[formula]

so that the mappings c  ↦  c' and c  ↦  c'' are inverses to each other and define algebra automorphisms on C. Note moreover that Cv = vC and Cu = uC since c''u = vcv = uc'.

Step 5. MC(A) = vM(C)v: Let m∈MC(A) and recall that its image is contained in EA. By Steps 3 and 4 together with Lemma [\ref=210], one can thus define a pair s: = (sl,sr) of linear mappings on C by the formulae

[formula]

To see that s is a multiplier of C, take c1,c2∈C. Then and so that sl(c1c2) = sl(c1)c2 and sr(c1c2) = c1sr(c2). Moreover, and therefore c1sl(c2) = sr(c1)c2. Consequently, s∈M(C) and m = vsv. Indeed, for all c∈C,

[formula]

and

[formula]

because v = v' = v''. Thus, [formula] and [formula], that is, m = vsv. This concludes the proof that MC(A)  ⊆  vM(C)v. The reverse inclusion is evident from Steps 3 and 4; thus the identity follows.

Step 6. A = vDv for some self-adjoint C-subbimodule D of M(C) containing C and 1: Putting

[formula]

the statement is clear from Steps 3 and 5 together with the inclusions EA  ⊆  A  ⊆  MC(A).

Step 7. [formula] for all d∈Dh: This is a special case of Lemma [\ref=222].

[formula] Clearly, A is self-adjoint. To show that u is an order unit of A, let a∈Ah. Then a = vdv for some d∈Dh. Since

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

as wanted. The order unit norm property of [formula] is immediate from the identities where we have employed the equivalence [\eqref=eq:order-norms] in Lemma [\ref=222]. As a result, (A,u) is an order unit .

The form A = vDv for a C-subbimodule D of M(C) which the A takes in Theorem [\ref=211] above is not the natural way one would expect an ideal of C to appear. However, there is a commutation relation hidden in its proof, which we make explicit now.

Let (A,u) be an order unit in the C and let [formula]. Then A = vDv for a self-adjoint C-subbimodule D of M(C) and vC = Cv. Moreover, EA = uC = Cu and MC(A) = uM(C) = M(C)u.

We shall use the notation of Step 4 in the proof of Theorem [\ref=211]. It was shown there that vC = Cv (which explains why A appears as an ideal in C). It follows immediately that EA = vCv = Cu = uC. To prove the final assertion we extend the automorphism c  ↦  c' and its inverse c  ↦  c'' from C to M(C) via n'c' = (nc)', c'n' = (cn)', n''c'' = (nc)'' and c''n'' = (cn)'' for n∈M(C). For each c∈C, we have and thus vn = n''v and nv = vn', that is, the identities from Step 4 extend to M(C). As a result, un' = vnv = n''u so that uM(C) = vM(C)v = M(C)u as claimed.

It follows from the above results that, whenever (A,u) is an order unit in the  C, MC(A) = uM(C)  ⊆  C and thus C is a Segal extension of MC(A).

This example shows that an order unit A is strictly larger than its approximate ideal EA unless A itself is a unital . By Theorem [\ref=211] (b), if (A,u) is an order unit in the C, then EA = vCv and A = vDv for a subbimodule D of M(C) which contains the identity 1 of M(C). Suppose EA = A. Then vCv = vDv which entails that C = D by Lemma [\ref=210] and C is unital. The density of A in C entails that A contains an invertible element, hence 1 itself so that A = C. To be concrete, this applies to any closed subalgebra [formula], where v(t) = 1 + t2, [formula] because [formula] (as [formula] is a in [formula]) and [formula] does not have an order unit.

Weighted s

We now introduce a class of s that provide the noncommutative analogue of the Nachbin algebras discussed in Example [\ref=26] above.

By a weighted we mean a pair (A,π), where

A is a self-adjoint in the C;

π:A  →  M(C) is a positive isometric C-bimodule homomorphism.

The order structure on the multiplier module MC(A) is defined such that the positive cone MC(A)+ agrees with [formula].

The link between Nachbin algebras and commutative weighted s is given by the result below, proved in [\cite=AK4].

Let (A,π) be a commutative weighted . Then A is isometrically *-isomorphic to a closed self-adjoint subalgebra of Cwb(Y) for a locally compact Hausdorff space Y and a continuous real-valued function w on Y with w(t)  ≥  1 for all t∈Y. In particular, up to an isometric *-isomorphism, EA = Cw0(Y) and MC(A) = Cwb(Y).

In the special case where A = Cvb(X), let Y denote the Gelfand space of A and let w be the weight function on Y defined by [formula]. Then EA = Cw0(Y), MC(A) = Cwb(Y), and [formula]. The mapping π in this special case is just multiplication by v. In particular, if v is identically 1 (so that [formula] too), then EA = A = Cb(X) = C(Y), where Y is the Stone- Cech compactification of X.

The main result of this subsection establishes a characterization of weighted s.

Let (A,π) be a weighted . Then there exists u∈Z(M(C))+ such that A = uπ(A). In particular, EA = uC and MC(A) = uM(C).

We divide the proof into six steps.

Step 1. π(EA) = C : It follows from the assumptions that π(EA) is a closed ideal of C. Since every closed ideal in a is its own square, one gets

[formula]

Since π is injective, it follows that EA  =  π(EA2). Combining this with the density of EA in C yields

[formula]

and thus π(EA) = C, as claimed.

By Lemma [\ref=123](iii), π can be extended to a strictly continuous C-bimodule homomorphism [formula].

Step 2. [formula] is a positive isometric surjective M(C)-bimodule homomorphism: For the M(C)-bimodule homomorphism property of [formula], let m∈MC(A) and n∈M(C). Given c1,c2∈C, one has

[formula]

and since C is a faithful ideal of M(C), it follows that [formula]. In a similar way, one obtains that [formula]. To see that [formula] is positive, let m∈MC(A)+ and c∈C. Then [formula] is in A+, and so

[formula]

which yields the positivity of [formula]. For the isometric property of [formula], let m∈MC(A). It is routine to check that

[formula]

Moreover, since each a∈A satisfies

[formula]

we conclude that as required. Finally, to establish the surjectivity of [formula], let n∈M(C). By Step 1 and the strict density of C in M(C), there is a net (mα)α∈Ω in EA such that

[formula]

for every c∈C. Therefore, for all α,β∈Ω, so that (mα)α∈Ω is a Cauchy net in the strict topology in MC(A). Letting m∈MC(A) be its strict limit, see Lemma [\ref=123](i), the strict continuity of [formula] entails that [formula].

Step 3. MC(A) = uM(C): By the surjectivity of [formula], there exists u∈MC(A) such that [formula] is the identity element of M(C). Given m∈MC(A), one has

[formula]

where we have employed the M(C)-bimodule homomorphism property of [formula]. As a result, [formula].

Step 4. A = uπ(A): This is a special case of [\eqref=eq:A-u-pi].

Step 5. EA = uC: Using Steps 1 and 4, we find

[formula]

as claimed.

Step 6. u belongs to Z(M(C))+: The centrality of u is immediate from the M(C)-bimodule homomorphism property of [formula]. To see that it is positive, let c∈C. Then

[formula]

implying that u*, and therefore u as well, is positive.

The following properties hold for a weighted  (A,π):

EA and MC(A) are self-adjoint;

[formula] is self-adjoint;

[formula] and [formula] coincide on A.

(i) Evident.

(ii) Let m∈MC(A); then

[formula]

where we have used [\eqref=eq:A-u-pi]. By Lemma [\ref=210], it follows that [formula], as wanted.

(iii) In view of Lemma [\ref=22], it is sufficient to show that A is a contractive bimodule over C, that is,

[formula]

for all a∈A and c∈C. But this is immediate from the assumptions on π.

The next result establishes the uniqueness of the "weight" of a weighted .

Let A be a self-adjoint in the  C. Suppose that π1,π2:A  →  M(C) are such that (A,π1) and (A,π2) are weighted s. Then π1  =  π2.

Let u1 and u2 denote positive elements of MC(A) for which [formula]. Since each a∈A satisfies a = u1π1(a) = u2π2(a), we conclude from Lemma [\ref=210] that π1  =  π2 if and only if u1 = u2. To show the latter identity, let c∈C. Then which, together with Corollary [\ref=219](iii), yields

[formula]

for all c∈C. It follows that [formula] for every n∈M(C) which, as is well known, implies that u1 = u2 since both are positive elements; see, e.g., [\cite=eL].

Theorems [\ref=211] and [\ref=214] suggest that there is a relation between weighted s and order unit s. In order to make this precise, we need to generalize the notion of a unitization of a .

By an order unitization of a self-adjoint A we mean a pair (B,φ), where

B is an order unit ;

φ is a positive isometric homomorphism from A into B;

φ(A) is a faithful ideal of B.

In the proposition below, φ denotes the embedding of A into MC(A), as given in Definition [\ref=121]. The notation will be that of Theorem [\ref=214].

Every weighted has an order unitization.

Let (A,π) be a weighted . Then (MC(A),φ) is an order unitization of it. Indeed, since MC(A) = uM(C) and each n∈M(C)h satisfies

[formula]

the centrality of u together with Theorem [\ref=211](b) imply that MC(A) is an order unit . The isometric property of φ was established in Step 2 of the proof of Theorem [\ref=214], and the other required properties are trivial. The proof is complete.

Among the basic examples of weighted s are the following principal ideals of s.

Let B be a , and let u∈Z(M(B))+ be such that uB is faithful in B. Then there is a norm on uB making it into a weighted , and uB has an approximate identity if and only if it is dense in B.

We may assume that [formula]. Put I: = uB and define [formula] by setting [formula] for x∈B. Clearly, [formula] is a norm on I making it into a self-adjoint in the  J, the closure of I in B. It is not hard to verify that the mapping ux  ↦  (lx,rx) is a positive isometric J-bimodule homomorphism from I into M(J). As a result, I is a weighted . The second statement follows from the identities EI = IJ = uBJ = uJ.
