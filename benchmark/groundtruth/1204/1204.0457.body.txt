Stable states and representations of the infinite symmetric group

Introduction

The problem studied in this paper can be briefly formulated as follows: what class of representations of countable groups is a natural extension of the class of representations with finite traces, i.e., representations determined by finite characters? Recall that a character of a group G is a positive definite central (i.e., such that χ(gh) = χ(hg) for all g,h∈G) function on G whose value at the group identity is equal to one. According to the GNS construction, an indecomposable character (which cannot be written as a nontrivial convex combination of other characters) determines a factor representation (f.r.) of finite type In, n <   ∞  , or II1. Conversely, a f.r. of finite type uniquely determines a character. For many (though not all) countable groups, the set of all f.r. of type II1 has the structure of a standard Borel space. At the same time, for countable groups that have no Abelian subgroup of finite index, the set of classes of pairwise nonequivalent irreducible representations is not tame. In particular, it has no standard Borel structure. Hence for these groups, there is no reasonable classification of irreducible representations. Moreover, there exist representations that have several different decompositions into irreducible components. Such groups are usually called wild. The infinite symmetric group [formula], which consists of all finite permutations of the set of integers [formula], is a typical example of a wild group. However, its f.r. of type  II1 are completely classified in [\cite=Thoma] [\cite=VK0] [\cite=Ok] and are used for constructing harmonic analysis. A similar situation holds for the infinite-dimensional unitary group [formula]. At the same time, important classes of countable groups, in particular, the infinite general linear group over a finite field [formula], have too few finite characters for constructing a nontrivial harmonic analysis. For instance, the characters of [formula] do not separate points. These considerations lead to the need for an extension of the class of representations of finite type, i.e., for a generalization of the notion of a character.

But the class of all representations of type II∞ is too wide: e.g., for the infinite symmetric group [formula], it is as wild (and in the same sense) as the set of classes of irreducible representations. Therefore, a putative extension must include some reasonable restrictions on representations of type II∞. An attempt to construct such an extension was made in [\cite=VK0], where a class of representations determined by semifinite traces on the group algebra was introduced. But this class turned out to be too narrow, it does not even cover all representations of [formula] of type II∞ associated with admissible representations of [formula].

In this paper, we introduce the class of stable representations, which is a natural extension of the class of representations of finite type. It turns out that stable representations of [formula] are of type II∞. We also give a complete classification of stable f.r. up to quasi-equivalence. At the same time, we obtain an answer to the question posed by the first author [\cite=VKOk] in connection with G. I. Olshanski's [\cite=Ol2] theory of admissible representations of the group [formula], that of identifying the components of an admissible representation. Namely, we prove that the set of stable f.r. coincides with the class of representations that can be obtained as the restrictions of admissible irreducible representations of [formula] to the left and right components ([formula] and [formula], respectively).

Basic notions

We introduce a new notion of stability for a positive definite function (p.d.f.) on a group and the corresponding representation. Typical groups for which this notion is meaningful and amenable to study are inductive limits of compact groups.

Topology on groups of automorphisms of a group

Let G be a countable group and [formula] be its group [formula]-algebra. We identify G with its natural image in [formula], and positive functionals (p.f.) on [formula] with the corresponding p.d.f. on G. A p.f. is called a state if it is equal to one at the group identity. Let Aut  G be the group of all automorphisms of G. An element g∈G determines an inner automorphism Ad  g∈Aut  G: Ad  g(x) = gxg- 1, x∈G. The group Int  G of inner automorphisms is a normal subgroup in Aut  G.

We endow Aut  G with the strong topology, in which a base of neighborhoods of the identity automorphism consists of the sets

[formula]

Now we introduce the strong topology on Aut  G for an arbitrary locally compact (l.c.) group. Let [formula] be the group of all automorphisms of the algebra [formula]. We identify Aut  G and Int  G with the corresponding subgroups in [formula]. A base of the strong topology on [formula] is determined by the neighborhoods Ua,ε of the identity automorphism, where

[formula]

Then Aut  G is a closed subgroup in [formula]. Denote by [formula] the completion of Int  G.

Let G =  lim Gi be the inductive limit of a sequence of l.c. groups [formula], where Gi is a closed subgroup in Gi + 1 for all i. A base of the strong topology on Aut  G is determined by the neighborhoods Un,a,ε, [formula], where

[formula]

1. Our basic example is as follows. Let [formula] be the set of positive integers. A bijection [formula] is called finite if the set [formula] is finite. We define [formula] as the group of all finite bijections [formula] and set [formula] for all [formula]. Denote by [formula] the subgroup in [formula] consisting of the elements leaving the numbers [formula] fixed (n <   ∞  ).

If [formula] is the group of all bijections of [formula], then [formula], and for every [formula], the map [formula] is an automorphism Ad  s of [formula], which can be naturally extended to an automorphism of the group [formula]-algebra [formula] of [formula]. One can easily check that [formula] coincides with [formula] and is the closure of [formula] in each of the topologies ([\ref=strong_discrete_top]), ([\ref=strong_aut_topology]), and ([\ref=strong_aut_topology_ind]), which are equivalent. In particular, [formula] is a dense normal subgroup in [formula].

2. Consider the infinite-dimensional unitary group U(  ∞  ), which is the inductive limit [formula] of the finite-dimensional unitary groups with respect to the natural embeddings. If Ad  g∈Un,a,ε, g∈U(  ∞  ), then g = g(n)  ·  g∞(n), where g(n)∈U(n) and g∞(n)  ·  u = u  ·  g∞(n) for all u∈U(n). It is not difficult to show that [formula] as ε  →  0 and [formula].

Characters and representations of [formula].

Let G be a countable group, and let Π be the biregular representation of the group G  ×  G. Then it follows from ([\ref=strong_aut_topology]) that the map [formula] can be extended by continuity to [formula]. This continuity is preserved if we replace the biregular representation of G by a representation corresponding to a character.

On the other hand, in the next section we will describe a construction of a unique, up to unitary equivalence, representation of G  ×  G, which plays the role of the biregular representation, for an arbitrary p.d.f. on G. But the corresponding representation of Int  G is, in general, no longer continuous. Hence it cannot be extended by continuity to [formula]. However, there is a class of states on G, containing finite characters, for which this continuity persists. This is exactly the class of stable states.

The canonical construction of representations of G  ×  G and Int  G

Let π be the representation of a group G corresponding to a state φ and M be the w*-algebra generated by the operators from π(G). Let [formula] be the commutant of M, M+* be the set of weakly continuous positive functionals on M, [formula] be a faithful state, and θ be the representation of M corresponding to [formula] in a Hilbert space [formula] with a bicyclic vector [formula]. Since [formula] is faithful, the map [formula] is an isomorphism (see [\cite=TAKES]).

Denote by [formula] the antilinear isometry from the polar decomposition of the closure of the map [formula] [formula], [formula]. Set [formula]. Since [formula], the map G  ×  G∋(g,h) [formula] is a representation.

Since [formula] for all m from the center of the algebra [formula] (see [\cite=TAKES]), a representation Aπ of the group Int  G is well defined by analogy with Section [\ref=rep_Int]: [formula].

Stable states and representations; admissible representations

Let G be a l.c. group, [formula], and [formula] be the dual space to [formula]. Given a state [formula], denote by oφ the map [formula].

A state φ is called stable if the map oφ is continuous in the strong topology on Int  G (see ([\ref=strong_aut_topology])) and in the norm topology of the dual space on [formula].

For every [formula], the map oψ is continuous in the weak topology of the dual space on [formula].

The representation of G corresponding to a stable state will also be called stable.

To define a stable p.d.f. on an inductive limit G =  lim nGn of l.c. groups, consider the cone C+G of p.d.f. on G with the topology defined by the metric [formula], φ,ψ∈C+G, where [formula] stands for the norm of the dual space [formula].

A p.d.f. φ on G is called stable if the map [formula] is continuous in the topology on Int  G defined according to ([\ref=strong_aut_topology_ind]).

If G is a free group, then the topology ([\ref=strong_discrete_top]) on Aut  G is discrete. Hence all p.d.f. on G are stable.

Now we introduce the notion of an admissible representation of G  ×  G, which extends the corresponding notion from [\cite=Ol2] to the case of an arbitrary group.

Let G be a l.c. group or an inductive limit of l.c. groups. A unitary representation Π of the group G  ×  G in a Hilbert space H is called admissible if the map Int  G∋Ad  g [formula] is continuous in the strong topology on Int  G (see ([\ref=strong_aut_topology]), ([\ref=strong_aut_topology_ind])) and in the strong operator topology on [formula].

Stable representations of the group [formula] and their classification

In this section, we formulate results on the classification of stable representations of [formula] up to quasi-equivalence.

With a stable f.r. π of the group [formula] we associate an invariant χπ  a, called an asymptotic character. Let M =  [formula].

We define the central depth cd(π) of a representation π as [formula]. Clearly, cd(π) is a quasi-equivalence invariant.

The next result describes the dependence of cd(π) on the Thoma parameters α,β of the asymptotic character χπ  a.

Now we describe a bijection between the set of quasi-equivalence classes of stable f.r. and the set "partially central" states on [formula].
