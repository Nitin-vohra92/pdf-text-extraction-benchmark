Introduction

The Haar measure on a compact topological group G is simply a Radon measure σG on the Borel sets of G which is translation invariant, that is, σG(gB) = σG(B) for every Borel set B and every g∈G. A well-known fact, essentially proved by A. Haar [\cite=ha] in 1933 (see also [\cite=ca] [\cite=Neu] [\cite=Ru] [\cite=we]), is that there is only one normalized Haar measure on G. In the same year (in fact in the same issue of Annals of Mathematics), J. von Neumann [\cite=vn] used Haar's Theorem to solve Hilbert's fifth problem in the case of compact groups. The uniqueness of the normalized Haar measure � be used later in this paper.

A cornerstone in the theory of absolutely summing operators, the Pietsch Domination Theorem asserts that a continuous linear operator v:X1  →  X2 between Banach spaces is absolutely p-summing if and only if there is a constant C > 0 and a Borel probability measure μ on the closed unit ball of the dual of X1, [formula] such that

[formula]

for every x∈X1. Such a measure μ is said to be a Pietsch measure for v.

When X1 = C(K) for some compact Hausdorff space, a simple reformulation of the Pietsch Domination Theorem tells us that a continuous linear operator v:C(K)  →  X2 is absolutely p-summing if and only if there is a constant C > 0 and a Borel probability measure μ on the Borel sets of K such that

[formula]

for every f∈C(K). The measure μ above is also called a Pietsch measure for v.

The Pietsch Domination Theorem has analogs in different contexts, including versions for classes of absolutely summing nonlinear operators (see, for example, [\cite=achour] [\cite=cha] [\cite=CDo] [\cite=Dimant] [\cite=FaJo] [\cite=SP] [\cite=joed]). Recently, in [\cite=BoPeRu] [\cite=PeSa] [\cite=adv] the concept of abstract R-S-abstract p-summing mapping was introduced in such a way that several previous known versions of the Pietsch Domination Theorem can be regarded as particular instances of one single result.

It is interesting to mention that in most of the cases we have almost no structural information on the Pietsch measures and, as mentioned in [\cite=DiJaTo], "in general its existence is accessible only by transfinite means". Nevertheless in the important case when X1 = C(G) and G is a compact Hausdorff topological group the precise nature of the Pietsch measure is known: motivated by results from [\cite=Gordon] [\cite=Pelc], in [\cite=DiJaTo] it is proved that if G is a compact topological group, then the normalized Haar measure on G is a Pietsch measure for any translation invariant p-summing linear operator on a closed translation invariant subspace of C(G) that separates points of G (cf. Theorem [\ref=tu]). The particular case in which G is the circle group [formula] is used in [\cite=K].

J. Diestel posed to the authors the question whether, as in the linear case, in this more general context of [\cite=BoPeRu] [\cite=PeSa] the normalized Haar measure on a compact topological group G is still a Pietsch measure for any translation invariant (not necessarily linear) R-S-abstract p-summing mapping on a closed invariant subspace of C(G). The precise meaning of the terms aforementioned used shall be clear in the forthcoming section.

In this paper we solve Diestel's question in the positive. We show in Section [\ref=results] that the answer is affirmative provided two natural and general conditions are satisfied (cf. Theorem [\ref=genHaar]). In Section [\ref=applications] we show that several usual classes of R-S-abstract summing (linear and non-linear) mappings enjoy these two conditions, confirming that Diestel's question has a positive answer in several important cases. In particular, we improve the original linear result from [\cite=DiJaTo] showing that the assumption that F separates points of G can be dropped (cf. Theorem [\ref=tugen]). However there are still some open questions which we detail in the final section.

Preliminaries and background

Henceforth G denotes a (non necessarily abelian) compact Hausdorff topological group. The operation on G shall be denoted as multiplicative. The symbol C(G) stands for the Banach space of continuous functions [formula], where [formula] or [formula], endowed with the usual sup norm.

(a) A non empty set F  ⊂  C(G) is closed (left) translation invariant if

[formula]

where Tφ(φ): = T(φφ).(b) Let X be any set and F be a closed translation invariant subset of C(G). A map u:F  →  X is translation invariant if u(T) = u(Tφ) for all φ∈G and T∈F. (c) A set F  ⊂  C(G) is said to separate points of G if for all x,y∈G, x  ≠  y, there exists T∈F such that T(x)  ≠  T(y).

The following version of the Pietsch Domination Theorem appears in [\cite=DiJaTo] (by πp(u) we denote the p-summing norm of the operator u):

If X is a Banach space, G is a compact Hausdorff topological group, F is a closed translation invariant subspace of C(G) that separates points of G, and u:F  →  X is a translation invariant p-summing linear operator, then the normalized Haar measure σG on G is a Pietsch measure for u in the sense that

[formula]

The assumption that F separates points of G is missing in [\cite=DiJaTo]. To understand where this assumption is needed in the proof provided by [\cite=DiJaTo], see Subsection [\ref=linearcase]. In that same subsection we provide a proof that does not require this extra assumption.

Next, we describe the general Pietsch Domination Theorem proved in [\cite=BoPeRu] [\cite=PeSa]. Let X, Y and E be (arbitrary) sets, and H be a family of mappings from Y to X. Let also Z be a Banach space and K be a compact Hausdorff topological space. Assume that [formula] is an arbitrary map and [formula] is so that

[formula]

is continuous on K for all (x,b)∈E  ×  Z. For 0 < p <   ∞  , a mapping f∈H is said to be R-S-abstract p-summing if there is a constant C > 0 so that

[formula]

for all [formula] [formula] and [formula]. The infimum of such constants C is denoted by πRS,p(f). The Unified Pietsch Domination Theorem [\cite=BoPeRu] [\cite=PeSa] reads as follows:

Let R and S be as above, 0 < p <   ∞   and f∈H. Then f is R-S-abstract p-summing if and only if there is a constant C > 0 and a regular Borel probability measure μ on K such that

[formula]

for all (x,b)∈E  ×  Z. Moreover, the infimum of such constants C equals πRS,p(f). Such a measure μ is called a R-S-abstract measure for f.

Thus, J. Diestel's question concerns the validity of Theorem [\ref=tu] in the context of Theorem [\ref=gen].

Main result

In this section we shall keep the notation of the previous one. In our main result (Theorem [\ref=genHaar] below) we have identified two natural conditions on R and S under which Diestel's question has a positive answer:

Let R and S be as above, 0 < p <   ∞  , and u:Y  →  X be a map in H. Let us further assume that

(i) K = G is a compact topological group and E is a closed translation invariant subspace of C(G),

(ii) R(φ,Tφ,b)  ≤  R(φφ,T,b) for all [formula] E  ×  Z and φ,φ∈G, and

(iii) The map Su,b:E  →  (0,  ∞  ) ~ defined by Su,b(T) = S(u,T,b) is translation invariant for every b∈Z.

If u is a R-S-abstract p-summing mapping, then the normalized Haar measure on G is a R-S-abstract measure for u.

By Theorem [\ref=gen] there exists a Borel probability measure μ on G such that

[formula]

for every (T,b)∈E  ×  Z. For each φ∈G define [formula] by

[formula]

for every T∈C(G). Indeed μφ is a probability measure as

[formula]

where 1G denotes the constant mapping taking the value 1. Now we prove that μφ is a R-S-abstract measure for u: given (T,b)∈E  ×  Z,

[formula]

Let σG denote the normalized Haar measure on G. As the map φ  ↦  μφ is continuous when [formula] is endowed with the weak*-topology, there exists a measure [formula] such that

[formula]

for every T∈C(G) (see [\cite=DiJaTo]). If T∈E, [formula], then

[formula]

so ν is a non-negative regular Borel measure on G. Moreover, the following calculation shows that ν is a probability:

[formula]

Since

[formula]

for every (T,b)∈E  ×  Z, it follows that

[formula]

for every (T,b)∈E  ×  Z. Therefore ν is a R-S-abstract measure for u. Next we prove that ν is translation invariant: given T∈C(G) and φ0∈G,

[formula]

By the uniqueness of the normalized Haar measure σG we conclude that ν  =  σG.

Note that the condition of translation invariance is imposed to the map Su,b(  ·  ): = S(u,  ·  ,b) instead of to the map u. Thus, although in the applications we always have the information that u is translation invariant, a priori our abstract result does not need this hypothesis. An extremal example shows that in fact this choice seems to be adequate: if S is the null mapping then obviously no hypothesis on u:Y  →  X is needed.

Applications

In this section we show that Theorem [\ref=genHaar] applies to several usual classes of R-S- abstract summing mappings, including some well-studied classes of (linear and nonlinear) absolutely summing mappings.

We shall use several times that if G is a compact Hausdorff space and F is a closed subspace of C(G), then

[formula]

for all [formula]. The first equality follows from the Hahn-Banach Theorem and the second follows from a canonical argument using point masses (cf. [\cite=DiJaTo]).

Absolutely summing linear operators

Let us see that, for linear operators, Theorem [\ref=genHaar] recovers and generalizes Theorem [\ref=tu]. First of all let us see that the assumption that F separates points of G is crucial in the proof that [\cite=DiJaTo] provides for Theorem [\ref=tu].

Consider the mapping

[formula]

It is easy to see that (i) δ(K)  ⊆  BF*, (ii) δ(K) is norming for F, (iii) δ(K) is weak* compact in F*. So, by the Pietsch Domination Theorem [\cite=DiJaTo] there is a Borel probability measure ν on (δ(K),w*) such that

[formula]

Since F separates points of K, it follows that δ is injective and the inverse function δ- 1:δ(K)  →  K is obviously measurable considering the Borel sets in K and in (δ(K),w*). Let μ be the image measure with respect to δ- 1, that is, μ is a Borel measure on K and μ(A)  =  ν(δ(A)). It is clear that μ is a probability measure and by [\cite=Folland] we have that

[formula]

for every f∈F.

The proof of the proposition above makes clear that the assumption that F separates points of G is needed to validate the assertion made in the first three lines of the proof of [\cite=DiJaTo]. Let us see that this assumption can be dropped with the help of Theorem [\ref=genHaar]:

Make the following choice for the parameters of Theorem [\ref=genHaar]:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Given [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

which proves that u is R-S-abstract p-summing. Let us see that the conditions of Theorem [\ref=genHaar] are satisfied:

[formula]

for all T∈F, φ,φ∈G and b∈Z; and using that u is translation invariant,

[formula]

for all φ∈G and b∈Z. So the normalized Haar measure σG on G is a R-S-abstract measure for u. Then

[formula]

for every T∈F; therefore σG is a Pietsch measure for u.

Dominated homogeneous polynomials

For the definition of dominated homogeneous polynomials and the corresponding Pietsch Domination Theorem, see [\cite=anais] or, without proof, [\cite=jfa].

Let F be a closed translation invariant subspace of C(G) and let P:F  →  X be a translation invariant p-dominated n-homogeneous polynomial. Choose

[formula]

H to be the Banach space P(nF;X) of continuous n-homogeneous polynomials from F to X with the usual sup norm,

[formula]

[formula]

Since P is p-dominated, there is a constant C such that, for all [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

So P is R-S-abstract p-summing. Note also that

[formula]

for all T∈F, φ,φ∈G and b∈Z, and using that P is translation invariant,

[formula]

for all T∈F and b∈Z. By Theorem [\ref=genHaar] we obtain that the normalized Haar measure σG on G is a R-S-abstract measure for P. Then

[formula]

for every T∈F; therefore σG is a Pietsch measure for P.

α-subhomogeneous mappings

For the definition of α-subhomogeneous mappings and the corresponding Pietsch Domination Theorem we refer to [\cite=mona].

Let F be a closed translation invariant subspace of C(G) and let f:F  →  X be a translation invariant α-subhomogeneous mapping. Choose

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Since f is α-subhomogeneous, there is a constant C such that, for all [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

So f is R-S-abstract p-summing. Note also that

[formula]

for every T∈F, φ,φ∈G and b∈Z, and using that f is translation invariant,

[formula]

for every T∈F and b∈Z. By Theorem [\ref=genHaar] we obtain that the normalized Haar measure σG on G is a R-S-abstract measure for f. Then

[formula]

for every T∈F; therefore σG is a Pietsch measure for f.

Absolutely summing arbitrary mappings

Let X and F be Banach spaces. Following [\cite=BoPeRu] (see also [\cite=matos]), an arbitrary mapping f:F  →  X is absolutely p-summing at a∈F if there is a [formula] so that

[formula]

for every natural number m and all [formula]. The Pietsch Domination Theorem for absolutely p-summing mappings at a∈F can be found in [\cite=BoPeRu].

Assume that F is a closed translation invariant subspace of C(G) and let f:F  →  X be a translation invariant absolutely p-summing mapping at 0∈F. ChooseSince f is absolutely p-summing at 0∈F, there is a constant C such that, for all [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

So f is R-S-abstract p-summing. Note also that for all T∈F, φ,φ∈G and b∈Z. Using that f is translation invariant,

[formula]

for all T∈F and b∈Z. By Theorem [\ref=genHaar] we obtain that the normalized Haar measure σG on G is a R-S-abstract measure for f. Then

[formula]

for every T∈F; therefore σG is a Pietsch measure for f.

Open Problems

For the definition of Lipschitz p-summing mappings and the corresponding Pietsch Domination Theorem we refer to [\cite=FaJo] [\cite=BoPeRu].

Problem. Let F be a closed translation invariant subspace of C(G), let X be a metric space and f:F  →  X be a translation invariant Lipschitz p-summing mapping. Is the Haar measure σG a Pietsch measure for f?

In the case of absolutely summing arbitrary mappings (Subsection [\ref=arbitrary]) we assumed that the translation invariant mapping f:F  ⊆  C(G)  →  X is absolutely p-summing at the origin. What about translation invariant mappings that are absolutely p-summing at some 0  ≠  T0∈F? We say that a vector T0∈F is translation invariant if Tφ0 = T0 for every φ∈G. Let T0∈F. Define

[formula]

It is easy to see that f is absolutely p-summing at T0 if and only if fT0 is absolutely p-summing at the origin. Besides, if T0 is translation invariant then f is translation invariant if and only if fT0 is translation invariant. Thus, if we assume that f is translation invariant and absolutely p-summing at T0, then fT0 is translation invariant and absolutely p-summing at the origin. Therefore the Haar measure is a Pietsch measure for fT0 and hence for f. Anyway we need the extra assumption that the vector T0 is translation invariant. Can this assumption be dropped?

Problem. Let F be a closed translation invariant subspace of C(G) and let f:F  →  X be a translation invariant mapping that is absolutely p-summing at some vector of F. Is the Haar measure σG a Pietsch measure for f?
