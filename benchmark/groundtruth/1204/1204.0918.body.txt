Reflexivity in precompact groups and extensions

A precompact Abelian group G of bounded order is reflexive iff the dual group [formula] has no infinite compact subsets and every compact subset of G is contained in a compact subgroup of G.

Any extension of a reflexive P-group by another reflexive P-group is again reflexive.

Introduction

The papers [\cite=ardaetal] [\cite=galimaca11] [\cite=jlm] [\cite=jlm2] have unveiled that the duality properties of the class of precompact groups are more complicated than expected. The following theorem summarizes some of the known facts that concern the duality of precompact groups, see below for unexplained terminology.

Let G be an Abelian group and let [formula] be a precompact topology on G induced by some group of homomorphisms [formula]. The topological group [formula] dual to the precompact group [formula] can be:

a discrete group, as for instance when H is countable (see [\cite=Aub] and [\cite=Cha]) or [formula] is the Σ-product of uncountably many copies of the discrete group [formula] (this can be deduced from (the proof of) Lemma 27.11 of [\cite=bana91], see Lemma [\ref=sigma] below). In this case [formula] is not reflexive.

a nondiscrete P-group. This is the case when when [formula] is the ω-bounded group that arises as the dual of a reflexive P-group, as those constructed in [\cite=jlm] and [\cite=jlm2]. Obviously [formula] is reflexive in this case.

a precompact noncompact group, as is the case of the infinite pseudocompact groups with no infinite compact subsets constructed in [\cite=galimaca11] and [\cite=ardaetal]. These groups are reflexive.

a compact group, as happens when [formula], the family of all homomorphisms of G to [formula].

The bases on which the reflexivity of precompact groups stands remain elusive so far. In this paper we give a first insight to this issue by establishing some general facts and giving some counterexamples to what could be regarded as reasonable generalizations of known results. We prove in Proposition [\ref=charbded] that a precompact Abelian group of bounded order is reflexive if and only if the compact subsets of the dual group [formula] are finite and every compact subset of G is contained in a compact subgroup.

We will especially address the behavior of reflexivity under extensions in precompact, ω-bounded, and P-groups. We recall that the class of P-groups is naturally linked to that of precompact groups through duality since, by [\cite=jlm], the dual group [formula] of every P-group G is ω-bounded and hence precompact.

Our starting point in this regard is the fact that an extension of a reflexive group by a compact group is again reflexive (see [\cite=BCM]). We show in Example [\ref=ex:extref] that an extension of a compact group by a reflexive precompact (even ω-bounded) group may be non-reflexive. In Corollary [\ref=cor:ext2] we prove, in contrast, that an extension of a reflexive P-group by another reflexive P-group is always reflexive.

Answering a question in [\cite=jlm] we prove in Section [\ref=Sec:Pmod] that, while the P-modification of an LCA group is always reflexive, the P-modification of a reflexive σ-compact group can fail to be reflexive.

Notation and terminology

All groups considered here are assumed to be Abelian. A character of a topological group G is a continuous homomorphism of G to the circle group [formula] when the latter is considered as a subgroup of in the complex plane [formula] with its usual topology and multiplication. The group [formula] of all characters of G with the pointwise multiplication is called the dual group or simply the dual of G. The dual group [formula] carries the compact-open topology τco defined as follows.

Put [formula]. For a nonempty set K  ⊂  G, we define

[formula]

The collection of sets [formula] forms a neighborhood basis at the identity of [formula] for the compact-open topology τco. Let us note that the sets [formula] are not necessarily open in [formula] since [formula] is not open in [formula]. If, instead of [formula], we use a smaller neighborhood U of 1 in [formula] to construct the sets [formula], the resulting sets will also form a neighbourhood basis at the identity for the compact-open topology τco.

The subgroup

[formula]

of [formula] is called the annihilator of a set K  ⊂  G. If [formula], we will also find useful to refer to the set [formula].

A subset A of a topological group G is called quasi-convex if [formula]. If quasi-convex sets in G form a neighborhood base of the neutral element in G, the group G will be called locally quasi-convex [\cite=Aub].

The bidual group of G is [formula]. The evaluation mapping [formula] is defined by

[formula]

for all x∈G and [formula]. It is easy to see that αG is a homomorphism. If it is a topological isomorphism of G onto [formula], the group G is called reflexive. Every reflexive group is locally quasi-convex [\cite=Aub].

Let H be a subgroup of a topological group G. We say that H dually embedded in G if each continuous character of H can be extended to a continuous character of G. A subgroup H of a topological group G is said to be h-embedded into G provided that any homomorphism φ of H to an arbitrary compact group K is extendable to a continuous homomorphism :G  →  K. Note that if H is an h-embedded subgroup of G, then any homomorphism of H to a compact group is continuous. Note also that every h-embedded subgroup H of G is dually embedded in G.

Let N be a closed subgroup of a topological group G. The group G is usually called an extension of G / N by the group N. For example, every feathered (equivalently, almost metrizable) Abelian group is an extension of a metrizable group by a compact group (see [\cite=AT]).

A space X is called ω-bounded provided the closure of every countable subset of X is compact. It is clear that every ω-bounded space is countably compact, but not vice versa.

Every pseudocompact topological group is precompact [\cite=CR2]. Hence all ω-bounded and countably compact groups are precompact. By a well-known theorem of Comfort and Ross in [\cite=CR], a topological group (G,τ) is precompact if and only if the topology τ of G is the topology [formula] generated by a group of characters [formula].

By a protodiscrete group we understand a topological group having a basis of neighborhoods of the identity consisting of open subgroups. Protodiscrete groups are also known as linear groups. Evidently, protodiscrete Abelian groups are locally quasi-convex.

A P-space is a space in which every Gδ-set is open. A P-group is a topological group which is a P-space. According to [\cite=AT], every P-group is protodiscrete.

Given a space X, the P-modification of X, denoted by PX, is the underlying set X endowed with the topology whose base consists of Gδ-sets in the original space X. It is clear that the P-modification of a topological group is again a topological group.

Let A denote a non-empty index set and let, for each α∈A, Gα be a compact group with identity eα. Given [formula], we put

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

It is clear that [formula] is a dense ω-bounded subgroup of [formula] (see [\cite=AT]). In particular, the group [formula] is countably compact. This subgroup of [formula] is called the Σ-product of the family {Gα:α∈A}. When Gα = G for all α∈A, we use the symbol ΣGA instead of [formula]. The group [formula] is usually known as the direct sum (and also as the σ-product) of the family {Gα:α∈A}.

On the duality of precompact Abelian groups

In this section we collect several general results concerning the duality theory of precompact groups. Some of them appear in the literature, while others might be known to specialists, but it seems convenient to have them all collected here for future references. In any case, the two lemmas below are well known.

If the family [formula] separates elements of the group G, then [formula] is a monomorphism.

If g∈G and g  ≠  0G, then there exists [formula] such that χ(g)  ≠  1 or, equivalently, αG(g)(χ)  ≠  1. Hence αG(g) is distinct from the neutral element of [formula] and αG is a monomorphism.

Every subgroup L of a precompact group G is dually embedded.

Let ϱG be the Weil completion of G and H be the closure of L in ϱG. Then H is a closed subgroup of the compact Abelian group ϱG, so [\cite=AT] implies that H is dually embedded in ϱG. By [\cite=AT], the dense subgroup L of H is dually embedded in H. Hence L is dually embedded in ϱG and in G.

Let G be a topological group. If each compact subset of G is contained in a reflexive, dually embedded subgroup, then αG is onto.

Let [formula] be an element of the bidual group. Then there is a compact subset K  ⊂  G such that [formula]. By hypothesis there is a reflexive dually embedded subgroup L of G with K  ⊂  L. Since [formula] we have that [formula]. Since L is dually embedded, this implies that Ψ factorizes through L̂. In other words, there is a continuous homomorphism [formula] that, denoting by R the canonical restriction map of [formula] to [formula], makes the following diagram commute.

[formula]

Notice that R is a continuous surjective homomorphism, while the continuity of ΨL follows from the inclusion K  ⊂  L. Since L is reflexive, ΨL  =  αL(g) for some g∈L. This means that Ψ  =  αG(g). Indeed, if [formula] then [formula].

The applicability of Proposition [\ref=compinref] in our context is enhanced by the following theorem of S. Hernández and S. Macario.

If G is a pseudocompact group, then [formula] has no infinite compact subsets.

Let H be a subgroup of [formula] that induces the topology of G. By [\cite=hernmaca03], every countable subgroup of [formula] is h-embedded, where [formula] is the topology (of H) of pointwise convergence on elements of G. This implies that [formula] cannot contain infinite compact subsets, see [\cite=ardaetal] or [\cite=galimaca11]. The same is true, a fortiori, for [formula].

Let G be a pseudocompact group. If every compact subset of G is contained in a compact subgroup of G, then G is reflexive.

Since G is pseudocompact (hence precompact), [formula] separates elements of G. Therefore, Lemma [\ref=Le:sepa] shows that αG is a monomorphism. By Lemma [\ref=duaemb], all subgroups of G are dually embedded. Hence Proposition [\ref=compinref] implies that αG is a group isomorphism. Since, by Lemma [\ref=pseudo], [formula] carries the topology of pointwise convergence on elements of [formula], just as G does, this isomorphism is easily seen to be a homeomorphism. The group G is therefore reflexive.

If G is precompact and αG is onto, then every closed metrizable subgroup of G is compact.

Let N be a metrizable subgroup of G. If ϱN denotes the completion of N we have, as a consequence of the Außenhofer-Chasco theorem (see [\cite=Aub] or [\cite=Cha]) that [formula].

If some closed metrizable subgroup N of G is not compact, there is [formula] with Ψ∉αN(N). Define now [formula] by [formula] for each [formula]. Then [formula]. Since αG is onto by hypothesis, there must be g∈G with ΨG  =  αG(g). As N is closed it follows that g∈N, for otherwise there is [formula] with [formula] and χ(g)  ≠  1 yielding that [formula]. But, since g∈N, this implies Ψ  =  αN(g)∈αN(N), against our choice of Ψ.

Let G be a precompact topological group such that [formula] is a protodiscrete group with no infinite compact subsets. Then G is reflexive if and only if every compact subset of G is contained in a compact subgroup of G.

Observe that the general hypothesis implies that αG is a topological isomorphism of G onto a subgroup of [formula].

Sufficiency: If every compact subset of G is contained in a compact subgroup of G, then αG is onto by Lemma [\ref=compinref].

Necessity: Suppose that G is reflexive and let K be a compact subset of G. Since [formula] is a neighbourhood of the identity of [formula], there is an open subgroup N of [formula] with [formula]. Now [formula] and [formula] is a compact subgroup of [formula], for N is open in [formula] (see [\cite=Nob2]). Thus K is contained in the compact subgroup [formula] of G.

Let G be a precompact topological group such that [formula] is a P-group. Then G is reflexive if and only if every compact subset of G is contained in a compact subgroup of G.

Clearly all compact subsets of a P-group are finite. Since every P-group is protodiscrete [\cite=AT], the conclusion follows from Proposition [\ref=prop:charprec].

If G is a precompact group of bounded order, then [formula] is a protodiscrete group.

Let n be the exponent of G. Choose a neighbourhood V of 1 in [formula] not containing n-roots of 1 other than 1 itself. Then the equality [formula] holds for every compact set K  ⊂  G. These sets form a basis of open neighbourhoods of the identity in [formula] and each of them is evidently a subgroup of [formula].

Let G be a precompact group of bounded order. Then G is reflexive if and only if it has the following two properties:

[formula] has no infinite compact subsets.

Every compact subset of G is contained in a compact subgroup of G.

If G is reflexive and [formula] is compact, then K is finite by [\cite=ardaetal]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:bded], [formula] is protodiscrete. Hence (2) follows from Proposition [\ref=prop:charprec].

Suppose conversely that (1) and (2) hold. Then, by Lemma [\ref=lem:bded], G satisfies the hypothesis of Proposition [\ref=prop:charprec] and is therefore reflexive.

Combining Lemma [\ref=pseudo] and Proposition [\ref=charbded] we deduce the following:

A pseudocompact group G of bounded order is reflexive if and only if each compact subset of G is contained in a compact subgroup of G.

Proposition [\ref=charbded] is false for groups of infinite exponent. It suffices to consider a torsion-free pseudocompact group G without infinite compact subsets (see Theorems 5.5, 5.7 and Corollary 5.6 of [\cite=galimaca11]). Such a group cannot contain any nontrivial compact subgroup.

Some extension results

We say that P is a three space property if for every Hausdorff topological group G and every closed invariant subgroup N of G such that both N and G / N have P, the group G has P as well. It is known, on one hand, that compactness, connectedness, precompactness, pseudocompactness, Rakov completeness, etc., are all three space properties. On the other hand, Lindelöfness, normality, having a countable network, countable compactness, and many others, fail to be three space properties (see [\cite=BT2] for a detailed discussion on the subject).

We have already mentioned in the introduction that extensions of reflexive groups by compact groups preserve reflexivity. However, we will see in Section [\ref=sec:nonexten] that an extension of a compact group by a reflexive (even ω-bounded) group may fail to be reflexive. Therefore reflexivity is not a three space property even among ω-bounded groups. The situation is completely different for the class of P-groups as we now set on to show. First we need two auxiliary facts.

Let H be a closed subgroup of a topological Abelian group G. If the groups H and G / H are protodiscrete, so is G.

Take an arbitrary neighborhood U of the neutral element e in G and choose another neighborhood V of e with V + V  ⊂  U. Since H is protodiscrete, there exists an open subgroup C of H with [formula]. Let W be an open symmetric neighborhood of e in G such that W  ⊂  V and [formula].

Denote by π the quotient homomorphism of G onto G / H. Since G / H is protodiscrete, one can find an open subgroup K of G / H satisfying K  ⊂  π(W). We claim that [formula] is an open subgroup of G with N  ⊂  U. The set N is open in G since K is open in G / H and W is open in G. It is also clear that N  ⊂  W + C  ⊂  V + V  ⊂  U. Therefore, to finish the proof, it suffices to verify that N is a subgroup of G.

First we note that N is symmetric, and C  ⊂  N (observe that C  ⊂  H). In fact, our definition of N implies that N + C = N. We then take arbitrary elements x1,x2∈N. There exist w1,w2∈W and c1,c2∈C such that xi = wi + ci for i = 1,2. Note that [formula]. Since K is a subgroup of G / H, we see that π(x1 + x2) = π(x1) + π(x2)∈K. Hence there exists x3∈N such that π(x3) = π(x1 + x2) and we can find h∈H such that x1 + x2 = x3 + h. Choose w3∈W and c3∈C such that x3 = w3 + c3. Then w1 + w2 - w3 = h - c1 - c2 + c3, so the element h - c1 - c2 + c3 is in [formula]. In its turn, this implies that h∈C. Therefore, x1 + x2 = x3 + h∈N + C = N. This shows that N is a subgroup of G and finishes the proof.

Let G be a topological group and H be a closed subgroup of G. Suppose that both H and G / H are reflexive, protodiscrete, and contain no infinite compact subsets. If [formula] is compact, then there is an open subgroup N of G with [formula].

Let K be a compact subset of [formula]. Denote by j the natural embedding of H to G. We consider the exact sequences

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then (K) is a compact subset of [formula]. Since H is reflexive and protodiscrete, there is an open subgroup P of H such that [formula], where [formula] is the annihilator of P in [formula]. This implies that [formula], with [formula] the annihilator of P in [formula].

Let now [formula] be an open subgroup of G with [formula] (here we use the protodiscreteness of G provided by Lemma [\ref=le:extprot]) and consider the sequence of mappings

[formula]

Here [formula] is the quotient homomorphism and σ is the obvious group isomorphism given by the third isomorphism theorem. Since [formula] is open in G, σ is a topological isomorphism.

We have the following dual sequence:

[formula]

As neither [formula] nor [formula] have infinite compact subsets, [formula] (and hence also [formula]) is a topological isomorphism onto [formula], the annihilator of P in [formula].

Finally, denote by [formula] the restriction homomorphism dual to the inclusion of [formula] into G. Since [formula], R(K) is contained in the image of [formula]. Then [formula] is a compact subset of the dual of the group [formula]. Notice that [formula] is reflexive as an open subgroup of the reflexive group G / H [\cite=BCM]. Since the former group is protodiscrete, there is an open subgroup N of [formula] (hence of G) such that [formula].

We finally claim that [formula]. To that end, let χ∈K and x∈N be arbitrary elements. Since [formula], there is some [formula] with [formula]. But then [formula] and, recalling that [formula], we see that

[formula]

In addition,

[formula]

Equalities [\eqref=seq] and [\eqref=seq2] show that χ(x) = 1 for all x∈N and χ∈K. Hence [formula].

Let H be a closed subgroup of a topological group G and assume that H and G / H contain no infinite compact subsets. If both H and G / H are reflexive and protodiscrete, then G is reflexive and protodiscrete.

It follows from our assumptions about H and G / H that all compact subsets of the group G are finite, while Lemma [\ref=le:extprot] implies that G is protodiscrete and, therefore, locally quasi-convex.

Take a basic open neighborhood of the neutral element in [formula] of the form [formula], where K is a compact subset of [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=prop:ext1], there exists an open subgroup N of G such that [formula]. Then [formula], so αG is continuous.

Since G is locally quasi-convex, αG is necessarily injective and open as a mapping onto αG(G) [\cite=Aub]. Finally, [formula] carries the topology of pointwise convergence on elements of G since G does not have infinite compact subsets and, as a consequence, αG is surjective (apply [\cite=CR]). We conclude that G is reflexive.

In Corollary [\ref=cor:ext2] below we show that the property of being a reflexive P-group is closed under extensions. Let us first establish that the class of P-groups behaves similarly:

Suppose that H is a closed subgroup of a topological (not necessarily Abelian) group G and that both H and G / H are P-groups. Then G is also a P-group.

Let π:G  →  G / H be the quotient homomorphism. Denote by τ the topology of G and let [formula] be the P-modification of the topology τ. It is clear that [formula] is finer than τ and that [formula] is again a topological group. In particular, H is closed in [formula]. Since H is a P-group, we see that [formula]. Similarly, since G / H is a P-group, the quotient groups [formula] and G / H carry the same topology, i.e.,  / H = τ / H. By [\cite=DS], this implies that   =  τ, so G is a P-group.

If H is a closed subgroup of a topological group G and both H and G / H are reflexive P-groups, then so is G.

It follows from Lemma [\ref=Le:Pg] that G is a P-group. Notice that P-groups are protodiscrete [\cite=AT] and have no infinite compact subsets [\cite=gilljeri]. Hence G is reflexive by Corollary [\ref=cor:ext1].

Extending compact groups by reflexive groups

In this section we present several examples of non-reflexive extensions of compact groups by ω-bounded groups. Let us start with two lemmas.

Let φ:H1  →  H2 be a continuous homomorphism of topological groups and Gr(φ) = {(x,φ(x)):x∈H1} be the graph of φ considered as a subgroup of H1  ×  H2. If L is a dense subgroup of H2, then the subgroup [formula] of H1  ×  H2 is an extension of H1 by L, where N = {e}  ×  L and e is the neutral element of H1. If L is Gδ-dense in H2, then G is Gδ-dense in H1  ×  H2.

It is easy to see that [formula], so N is a closed subgroup of G topologically isomorphic to L. Since N is dense in {e}  ×  H2, it follows from [\cite=Gra] that the restriction to G of the projection π:H1  ×  H2  →  H1 to the first factor is an open homomorphism of G onto H1. Therefore, [formula].

Finally, suppose that L is a Gδ-dense subgroup of H2 and let V1  ×  V2 be a non-empty Gδ-subset of H1  ×  H2. Take x∈V1; by the Gδ-density of L there must be [formula]. Then [formula] and hence G is Gδ-dense in H1  ×  H2.

Let [formula] be the P-modification of the compact group [formula]. There is a topological monomorphism [formula] such that [formula].

Let A be a maximal independent subset of P. Denote by jA the restriction homomorphism of [formula] to [formula], [formula] for each [formula]. We claim that jA is a topological isomorphism of [formula] onto the dense subgroup [formula] of [formula].

Indeed, jA is a monomorphism since A generates the group P algebraically. Since the compact subsets of P are finite, [formula] is a topological subgroup of [formula]. Hence the continuity of jA follows from the continuity of the projection of [formula] to [formula]. Let us show that jA is open as a mapping of [formula] onto the subgroup [formula] of [formula]. Given a neighborhood U of the neutral element in [formula], we can find elements [formula] in P such that

[formula]

For every i  ≤  n, take elements [formula] such that [formula] and let

[formula]

and

[formula]

An easy verification shows that [formula], which implies that jA is open. Summing up, jA is a topological monomorphism. The density of [formula] in [formula] is evident. Note that [formula] if and only if χ(a) = 1 for all but countably many a∈A.

For every C∈[null]≤  ω, let NC  =  π- 1C(eC) be the Gδ-subset of [formula], where [formula] is the projection and eC is the neutral element of [formula]. Let YC denote a maximal independent subset of NC. Observe that, for every x∉NC, x  ·  YC is again independent.

For every B∈[null]≤  ω, choose an element [formula] which is supported precisely on B, that is, xB(α) =  - 1 iff α∈B.

We then define, for all B,C∈[null]≤  ω with [formula], the sets XB,C = xB  ·  YC. Since each XB,C is independent and has cardinality [formula], we may construct as in Lemma 4.4 of [\cite=comfgali03] a collection of sets ZB,C  ⊂  XB,C, such that:

[formula];

[formula] if [formula];

[formula] is independent.

Let Z be a maximal independent subset of [formula] containing the union in (3). Denote by j = jZ the topological monomorphism of [formula] to [formula] corresponding to Z.

Suppose now that [formula], [formula]. Since ψ is continuous there must be C∈[null]≤  ω such that ψ(NC) = {1}. As [formula] (and noting that [formula] is dense in P), there must also be B∈[null]≤  ω with ψ(xB) =  - 1; observe that necessarily [formula]. It follows that ψ(xB  ·  NC) = { - 1} and ψ(ZB,C) = { - 1}, which means that [formula]. This implies that [formula]. Note that [formula], so we complete the proof by identifying Z with [formula].

There is a non-reflexive pseudocompact group G that arises as an extension of a compact group [formula] by a closed, reflexive, ω-bounded subgroup L of G.

Let P be the P-modification of the compact group [formula]. By Theorem 4.8 of [\cite=jlm], P is reflexive. Denote by L the character group of P. It is easy to see that [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=pdualsigma], there is a topological monomorphism [formula] such that j(L) is dense in [formula] and [formula]. In the sequel we identify L with j(L).

Let K be a compact subset of [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] is dense in [formula]. For example, one can take [formula], where e is the neutral element of [formula] and bα(β) =  - 1 only if α  =  β; [formula]. Let also RK be a subgroup of [formula] such that [formula] and define a (necessarily discontinuous) homomorphism [formula] with the following properties:

[formula] is the identity mapping;

φ(r)∉rL for every r∈RK with r  ≠  e.

To construct such a homomorphism we first observe that [formula] and then consider a maximal independent subset [formula] of RK. It suffices to define φ satisfying (1) such that [formula], for each [formula].

We use the homomorphism φ to apply Lemma [\ref=lem:constG] and consider the subgroup [formula] of [formula], where N = {e}  ×  L. By Lemma [\ref=lem:constG], G is a Gδ-dense subgroup of the compact group Π, so G is pseudocompact according to [\cite=CR2].

Then [formula] is a compact subset of G. If [formula], then a = b and a = φ(a)y with y∈L. Since a = kr with k∈〈  K  〉 and r∈RK, we see ry- 1  =  φ(r). Therefore (2) implies that r = e. This proves the inclusion

[formula]

while the inverse inclusion is evident. Thus [formula] is a closed subgroup of G. Since [formula] is a proper dense subgroup of [formula] it follows that [formula] is not compact and, hence, the group G is not reflexive by Corollary [\ref=cor:boundedpseudo].

We now construct a larger family of extensions of compact (even metrizable) groups by ω-bounded groups. This requires several preliminary steps.

Given an abstract Abelian group G, we denote by G# the underlying group G which carries the maximal precompact group topology [\cite=vDo]. This topology on G is called the Bohr topology of G. Notice that every homomorphism of G# to [formula] is continuous and that this property characterizes G# among precompact groups. The following fact is a part of the duality folklore.

Let K be a compact Abelian topological group and [formula] be the dual group of K with topology τp(K) of pointwise convergence on elements of K. Then τp(K) is the Bohr topology of the (abstract) group [formula].

By the classical Pontryagin-van Kampen duality theorem [formula] is a discrete group and [formula] is a topological isomorphism. Therefore, the Bohr topology of [formula] is the precompact group topology τp(K) generated by K.

Let κ  ≥  ω be a cardinal number. We say that a subgroup [formula] satisfies condition (Sm) provided that for every N∈[L]≤  ω there is a set AN  ⊂  2κ with |AN| = 2κ such that πAN(N) = {eN}, where [formula] is the projection and eN is the neutral element of [formula].

Given a cardinal κ, we denote by [formula] the direct sum of κ copies of the group [formula].

Let κ  ≥  ω be a cardinal, L be a dense pseudocompact subgroup of [formula] with |L|  ≤  2κ, and suppose that [formula] is discrete and satisfies (Sm). Then there exists a pseudocompact group G containing L as a closed subgroup with G / L compact and such that

[formula]

where [formula] stands for the group [formula] equipped with its Bohr topology.

Let S be the family of countable subgroups of [formula]. Consider the family

[formula]

It is clear that |A| = 2κ. Let us fix an injective mapping ρ:A  →  2κ such that ρ(S,f,h)∈Ah(S) for every (S,f,h)∈A; here Ah(S) is as in Definition [\ref=Df1]. The existence of such a mapping ρ follows from the equalities |A| = 2κ and |AS| = 2κ for S∈S. For each (S,f,h)∈A, we consider a homomorphism [formula] extending f, where α  =  ρ(S,f,h). Finally, for each α < 2κ we define a homomorphism [formula] by the following rule:

[formula]

Let φ be the diagonal product of φα's, [formula].

We define the group [formula] for these φ and N as in Lemma [\ref=lem:constG]. Then G is a dense subgroup of [formula]. According to Lemma [\ref=lem:constG], G is Gδ-dense in Π, so G is pseudocompact by [\cite=CR2]. Let π be the projection of the product Π to the first factor [formula].

We now proceed to identify the dual group of G. This task requires an analysis of the structure of compact subsets of G. We start with the following fact:

Claim 1. If S is a countable subgroup of G and the restriction of π to S is one-to-one, then S is h-embedded in G.

Indeed, let S be a countable subgroup of G such that [formula] is one-to-one. Then S is the graph of a homomorphism [formula], where D = π(S). It follows from the definition of G that [formula], where h is a homomorphism of D to L.

Let [formula] be an arbitrary homomorphism. For every z∈S, put f(π(z)) = p(z). Then [formula] is a homomorphism and (D,f,h)∈A. With α  =  ρ(D,f,h) we have [formula] and h(x)α = 1 for each x∈D since α∈Ah(D).

For every α < 2κ, let [formula] be the projection of the product group [formula] to the αth factor [formula]. We claim that the homomorphism p coincides with the restriction to S of the continuous homomorphism [formula], where [formula] is the projection of Π to the second factor. Indeed, take an arbitrary element z = (x,y)∈S. Then y = h(x)  ·  φ(x), since S is the graph of the homomorphism [formula]. We have, on one side, that

[formula]

On the other side, it follows from our choice of α < 2κ and the definition of φ that

[formula]

Comparing the above equality and equality [\eqref=1], we infer that p(z) = πα(ϖ(z)) for each z∈S, which proves that [formula].

Thus, every homomorphism [formula] extends to a continuous homomorphism of G to [formula]. This proves Claim 1.

Claim 2. If S is a countable subgroup of G and the restriction of π to S is one-to-one, then π(clG(S)) = π(S).

Let g be an element of G such that π(g)∉π(S). It suffices to show that g∉clG(S). It follows from our choice of g that the restriction of π to the subgroup [formula] of G is also one-to-one. Hence, by Claim 1, T is h-embedded in G. Let φ be a homomorphism of T to [formula] such that φ(g) =  - 1 and φ(S) = {1}. Then φ is continuous on T and, therefore, g∉clG(S).

Claim 3. The projection π(K) is finite, for every compact set K  ⊂  G.

Suppose for a contradiction that π(K) is infinite, for a compact subset K of G. We can assume without loss of generality that π(K) does not contain the neutral element e of [formula]. Clearly π(K) contains a countable infinite independent subset, say X. Choose a subset Y of K such that π(Y) = X and the restriction of π to Y is one-to-one. Then Y is countable and independent in G and the restriction of π to the subgroup [formula] of G is one-to-one. Let [formula]. Then C is a compact subset of G and Claim 2 implies that π(C)  ⊂  π(S). It also follows from [formula] and π(Y) = X that the compact sets C and π(C) are infinite. Since π(C) is countable (hence metrizable) and X  ⊂  π(C), there exists a sequence {xn:n∈ω}  ⊂  X converging to an element x*∈π(C), where x*  ≠  xn for each n∈ω. Notice that x*  ≠  e. By induction we can choose an infinite subset X' of {xn:n∈ω} such that [formula]. Take a subset Y' of Y such that π(Y') = X' and let [formula]. Arguing as above, we see that [formula] is a compact subset of G, π(C')  ⊂  π(S'), and that X' = π(Y')  ⊂  π(C'). In particular, the compact set π(C') contains infinitely many points xn's and, hence, x*∈π(C'). The latter, however, is impossible since [formula] and [formula]. This proves Claim 3.

We now obtain a complete description of [formula], both algebraic and topological. Since G is dense in Π (and hence each character of G extends to a character of Π), there exists a natural (abstract) isomorphism

[formula]

The second isomorphism in ([\ref=Eq:Iso]) is obtained by restricting every character of Π to the factors [formula] and [formula]. Since the groups [formula] and [formula] are compact, [formula] and [formula] are Boolean groups of cardinality κ and 2κ, respectively.

Finally, we claim that [formula] is topologically isomorphic to the group

[formula]

where τp stands for the pointwise convergence topology on the abstract group [formula].

For each [formula] and each P  ⊂  G, let

[formula]

If K  ⊂  G is compact, then F = π(K) is finite and the set

[formula]

is a compact subset of L. Since K  ⊂  CF,PK, we deduce that the family

[formula]

forms a local base at the neutral element of the group [formula].

Let now F  ⊂  π(G) be finite and P  ⊂  L be compact. If [formula], then

[formula]

The sets [formula] are therefore neighborhoods of the identity in [formula].

We now use the fact that [formula] is discrete and take a compact set P0  ⊂  L such that [formula], where [formula] is the neutral element of [formula]. Since CF,P0 contains the set {e}  ×  P0, we see that [formula], for every finite set [formula]. Therefore, [formula] is topologically isomorphic to [formula]. It only remains to observe that, by Lemma [\ref=Le:vDo], [formula] is exactly [formula].

There exists a pseudocompact Abelian group G which contains a closed ω-bounded (hence countably compact) subgroup N such that the dual groups [formula] and [formula] are discrete, but [formula] is not. In addition, the quotient group G / N is compact metrizable, while the bidual group [formula] is compact and topologically isomorphic to ϱG, the completion of G.

In Lemma [\ref=lem:newref], let κ  =  ω and take L to be the Σ-product ΣΠ, where [formula]. It is obvious that L is ω-bounded and dense in Π, satisfies condition (Sm), and the dual group [formula] is discrete. Applying Lemma [\ref=lem:newref], we find a dense pseudocompact subgroup G of [formula] containing L as a closed subgroup such that [formula] and [formula]. In particular, [formula] is not discrete. Further, the standard calculation shows that

[formula]

Since G is dense in [formula], we conclude that [formula].

The group G in Corollary [\ref=Co:OldT] fails to be countably compact, even when the closed subgroup L of G is countably compact (even ω-bounded) and the quotient group [formula] is compact and metrizable. The first example of a such a group was constructed in [\cite=BT].

Let us show that the present group G contains an infinite closed discrete subset. We keep the notation adopted in Lemma [\ref=lem:newref]. Take a sequence [formula] converging to an element [formula], where x*  ≠  e. We can assume that for each n∈ω, the element xn is not in the subgroup of [formula] generated by the set [formula]. For every n∈ω, let zn = (xn,yn), where yn  =  φ(xn). It follows from the definition of G that the set P = {zn:n∈ω} is contained in G.

We claim that P is closed and discrete in G. Since π(zn) = xn and xn  →  x*, all accumulation points of P, if any, lie in π- 1(x*). Take an arbitrary point [formula]. Again, our definition of G implies that y = φ(x*)  ·  s, for some s∈L. Denote by D the subgroup of [formula] generated by [formula] and take a homomorphism [formula] such that f(x*) =  - 1 and f(xn) = 1, for each n∈ω. Since [formula] is countable and the mapping [formula] is injective, there exists a homomorphism h:D  →  L such that [formula]. Notice that [formula]. We now have that

[formula]

while a similar calculation shows that παϖ(zn) = 1, for each n∈ω. Since the homomorphism [formula] is continuous, we conclude that z∉clGP. This proves that P is closed and discrete in G and that G is not countably compact.

P-modification of reflexive groups

In our first example we show that the P-modification of a reflexive σ-compact group can fail to be reflexive. Our argument uses essentially Pestov's theorem about the reflexivity of free Abelian topological groups on zero-dimensional compact spaces (see [\cite=Pes] [\cite=Pes2]).

Let D be an uncountable discrete space and X a one-point compactification of D with a single non-isolated point x0.

Let G = A(X) be the free Abelian topological group over X. Then the P-modification PG of G is topologically isomorphic to the free Abelian topological group A(Y), where Y = PX is the P-modification of the space X.

It is clear that Y is a Lindelöf P-space, and so is every finite power of Y [\cite=Nob]. Hence the group A(Y) is Lindelöf, while [\cite=AT] implies that A(Y) is a P-space.

Let i:A(Y)  →  A(X) be the continuous isomorphism of A(Y) onto A(X) which extends the identity mapping of Y onto X. It suffices to verify that i is a homeomorphism of A(Y) onto PA(X) (the group A(X) with the P-modified topology).

Let C be a countable subset of D. Denote by rC the retraction of X onto [formula], where rC(x) = x for each x∈XC and rC(y) = x0 for each [formula]. Clearly, rC is continuous. Extend rC to a continuous homomorphism RC:A(X)  →  A(XC). Since the free Abelian topological group A(XC) has countable pseudocharacter (and RC is continuous), ker RC is a closed Gδ-set in A(X). Hence HC = i- 1( ker RC) is an open subgroup of A(Y).

Consider the family

[formula]

It is easy to see that if {Cn:n∈ω} is a sequence of countable subsets of D and [formula], then [formula]. It is also clear that the intersection of the family H contains only the neutral element of A(Y).

We claim that H is a local base at the neutral element e of A(Y). Indeed, take an arbitrary open neighborhood U of e in A(Y). Suppose for a contradiction that every element of H meets the closed subset [formula] of A(Y). Then the family [formula] of closed subsets of A(Y) has the countable intersection property. Since the space A(Y) is Lindelöf, we must have that [formula], which contradicts the equality [formula].

Finally, since ker RC is open in PA(X), the P-modification of A(X), this implies that i:A(Y)  →  PA(X) is a homeomorphism.

The proof of the following fact is implicitly contained in (the proof of) Lemma 17.11 of [\cite=bana91]. We include the proof for the sake of completeness, it follows that the same result is valid for any infinite direct sum or any infinite Σ-product of compact groups (see [\cite=comfraczktrig04])

The dual group [formula] of the Σ-product [formula] is a discrete group.

Define for each [formula] and d∈D the element of [formula] that takes the value x at d and 1 elsewhere. The set [formula] is then a compact subset of [formula]. Since for each d∈D, the set [formula] is a subgroup of [formula] contained in K, we conclude that χ(Ad) = {1} for every [formula] and d∈D. But the subgroup generated by all the Ad's is dense in [formula], therefore [formula] and [formula] is discrete.

The free Abelian topological group G = A(X) is reflexive, but the P-modification PG of G is not. Furthermore, the second dual of PG is discrete.

Since X is a zero-dimensional compact space, the reflexivity of G follows from [\cite=Pes] or [\cite=Pes2]. Let us verify that PG is not reflexive. Since, by Lemma [\ref=Le:1], PA(X) is topologically isomorphic to A(Y), where Y = PX, and neither Y nor A(Y) is discrete, it suffices to show that the second dual of A(Y) is discrete.

Clearly, all compact subsets of the P-space Y are finite, so Y is a μ-space. It follows from [\cite=GH] that the dual group [formula] is topologically isomorphic to [formula], the group of all continuous functions on X with values in the circle group [formula], endowed with the pointwise convergence topology.

Let [formula], where x0 is the only non-isolated point of Y. Every neighborhood of x0 in Y has the form [formula], where C is a countable subset of D. Therefore, for every element [formula], there exists a countable set C  ⊂  D such that f(x) = f(x0) for each [formula].

Denote by [formula] the Σ-product lying in [formula] and considered as a dense subgroup of the compact group [formula]. We consider a mapping [formula] defined by φ(f) = (f(x0),tf  ·  f), where [formula] and the function tf  ·  f is restricted to D. Then [formula] and [formula]. Since [formula] carries the topology of pointwise convergence, φ is a topological isomorphism of [formula] onto [formula]. Hence the dual of [formula] is topologically isomorphic to [formula], where [formula] is the discrete group of integers. Finally, we know by Lemma [\ref=sigma] that the dual group [formula] is discrete. Hence the second dual [formula] is discrete as well.

Let D be an uncountable discrete space and let Y denote the one-point Lindelöfication of D. Then [formula] is not reflexive.

We note that Y = PX, where X is the one-point compactification of D. The proof of Example [\ref=Ex:1] shows that [formula] is discrete, while [formula], being a proper dense subgroup of [formula], is not compact.

Corollary [\ref=Cor:Last] is in contrast with Example 3.12 of [\cite=hernuspe00], where it is shown that [formula] is reflexive if |D| = ω1 and MA(ω1) is assumed (here [formula] stands for the field of complex numbers).
