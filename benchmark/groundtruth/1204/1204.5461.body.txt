Canonical smoothing of compact Alexandrov surfaces via Ricci flow.

Introduction

Ricci flow of smooth manifolds has had strong applications to the study of smooth Riemannian manifolds. It is therefore natural to ask if Ricci flow can be helpful in the study non-smooth geometric objects. A reasonable assumption to make on a metric space (X,d) that we want to deform by the Ricci flow is to require (X,d) to be approximated in some sense by a sequence (Mi,gi) of smooth Riemannian manifolds. In [\cite=MR2526789] and [\cite=MS2009], M. Simon studied a class of 3-dimensional metric spaces by this method. An important feature of such "Ricci flows of metric spaces" is that the notion of initial condition has to be weakened. In the work of M. Simon [\cite=MR2526789] and [\cite=MS2009], and of the author [\cite=2011arXiv1111.0859R], a weak notion of inititial condition has been used, which we call "metric initial condition" :

A Ricci flow (M,g(t))t∈(0,T) on a compact manifold M is said to have the metric space (X,d) as metric initial condition if the Riemannian distances dg(t) uniformly converge as t goes to 0 (as functions [formula]) to a distance d̃ on M such that (M,d̃) is isometric to (X,d).

The compactness assumption in the definition gives that (X,d) is homeomorphic to M with its manifold topology. This follows from the fact that d̃ is continuous on M, which implies that the identity of M is continuous as an application from M with its usual topology to M with the topology definied by d̃, compactness of M then give that the identity is an homeomorphism.

The existence of such flows for some classes of metric spaces (X,d) has been proved in [\cite=MR2526789],[\cite=MS2009] and [\cite=2011arXiv1111.0859R]. An interesting class of spaces for which existence holds is the class of compact Alexandrov surfaces whose curvature is bounded from below. In this paper we prove uniqueness for the Ricci flow with such surfaces as metric initial condition, more precisely :

Let (M1,g1(t))t∈(0,T] and (M2,g2(t))t∈(0,T] be two smooth Ricci flows which admit a compact Alexandrov surface (X,d) as metric initial condition. Assume furthermore that one can find K > 0 such that :

[formula]

Then there exist a conformal diffeomorphism φ:M1  →  M2 such that g2(t) = φ*g1(t).

Note that the required bounds on the Ricci flow are those which are provided by the existence proof.

In the next few lines, we outline the proof of Theorem [\ref=uniqthm]. Any of the two Ricci flows (Mi,gi(t)) stays in a fixed conformal class, and thus can be written gi(t) = wi(x,t)hi(x) for some fixed background metric hi which can be chosen to have constant curvature. We fisrt show that the metric initial condition prescribes the conformal class of the flow, thus we can assume that h1 = h2 = h. The proof of this fact uses deep results from the theory of singular surfaces introduced by A. D. Alexandrov. This implies that our two Ricci flows can be seen as solutions of the following nonlinear PDE on (M,h) :

[formula]

One then shows that each of the wi has an L1 initial condition as t goes to 0 and uses standard techniques to show uniqueness.

Our result can be stated in two other ways :

Let M be a smooth compact topological surface, and d be a distance on such that (M,d) is an Alexandrov surface with curvature bounded from below.

Let g1(t)t∈(0,T) and g1(t)t∈(0,T) be two Ricci flows on M which are smooth with respect to some differential structures on M. Assume furthermore that one can find K > 0 such that :

[formula]

and that for i = 1,2 the distances dgi(t) uniformly converge to d as t goes to 0.

Then g1(t) = g2(t) for t∈(0,T).

This proposition is not a consequence of Theorem [\ref=uniqthm], but just requires a minor adjustment in its proof, which will be indicated in Section [\ref=sec:uniq-conf-class].

Let (M1,g1(t))t∈(0,T] and (M2,g2(t))t∈(0,T] be two smooth Ricci flows such that for i = 1,2 (Mi,gi(t)) Gromov-Hausdorff converges to a compact Alexandrov surface (X,d) whith curvature bounded from below as t goes to 0. Assume furthermore that one can find K > 0 such that :

[formula]

Then there exist a conformal diffeomorphism φ:M1  →  M2 such that g2(t) = φ*g1(t).

We just have to show that if (M2,g(t))t∈(0,T) is a smooth Ricci flow on a surface M2 such that for all t∈(0,T) Kg(t)  ≥   - K and such that (M2,g(t)) Gromov-Hausdorff converges to (X,d) as t goes to 0, then (X,d) is the metric initial condition for the Ricci flow (M2,g(t)).

Since the diameter and the volume are continuous with respect to Gromov-Hausdorff convergence with sectionnal curvature bounded from below, we have bounds on the diameter and the volume of (M,g(t)) which are independent of t. Thanks to the lower bound on the curvature and Bushop-Gromov inequality, we thus have some v0 > 0 such that :

[formula]

Thanks to Lemma 4.2 in [\cite=MS2009], we then have that, for some constant C > 0 and all t∈(0,T) (for some possibly smaller T > 0) :

[formula]

One can then argue as in the proof of Theorem 9.2 of [\cite=MS2009] to show that, as t goes 0, the Riemannian distances uniformly converge to a distance d̃ on M such that (M,d̃) is isometric to (X,d). Thus (X,d) is the metric initial condition of the Ricci flow (M,g(t)).

As a corollary, we obtain the following statement, which says that for surfaces with curvature bounded from below Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of the initial conditions implies smooth convergence of the Ricci flows :

Let [formula] be a sequence of compact surfaces with curvature bounded from below which converges to a compact Alexandrov surface (X,d) with curvature bounded from below, then there exist T > 0 such that the Ricci flows [formula] with initial condition (Mi,gi) exist at least for t∈[null].

We will prove that for any smooth nonnegative function η on M and any T'∈(0,T] :

[formula]

Let ψ be a smooth function on M  ×  (0,T'] and 0 < s < T', then :

[formula]

where [formula]. Since w1 and w2 are smooth on M  ×  (0,T], A is smooth too. Moreover, by the mean value theorem and lemma [\ref=estimw], we have, for (x,t)∈M  ×  (0,T] :

[formula]

where φ is the positive continuous function defined by:

[formula]

We now choose ψ to be the solution of the following backwark heat equation : Thanks to the properties of A, ψ is smooth on M  ×  (0,T'] and the maximum principle shows that : 0  ≤  ψ(x,t)  ≤   sup x∈Mη(x). we get :

[formula]

We now let s go to 0, since w1(.,s) - w2(.,s) goes to 0 in L1 norm and ψ(x,s) is bounded, the right hand side of the previous equality goes to 0 and :

[formula]

Since this equality is true for any η and any T' > 0, we have that w1 and w2 are equal almost everywhere, since these functions are smooth, we get equality everywhere.

Facts from the theory of Alexandrov surfaces

This appendix gathers the results from the theory of Alexandrov surfaces with bounded integral curvature or curvature bounded from below that have been used in the paper. All these results can be found in the works of Alexandrov and Reshetnyak (see [\cite=MR2193913], [\cite=MR0216434] and [\cite=MR1263964]). A survey in a more modern language can be found in [\cite=2009arXiv0906.3407T].

We use two notions of surfaces with special curvature properties in this work. Our main objects of interest are compact surfaces with curvature bounded from below by - k, which are surfaces with an intrinsic metric (X,d) whose geodesic triangles are "fatter" than those in the complete simply-connected surface of constant curvature - k (see [\cite=MR1835418], chapter 4 and 10).

A wider class of surfaces is the class of surfaces with bounded integral curvature in the sense of Alexandrov. The definition we give in the next few lines stays informal, precise definition can be found in [\cite=MR0216434] and [\cite=MR1263964]. The excess of a geodesic triangle T in an intrinsic is defined by e(T) = (α  +  β  +  γ) - π where α, β and γ are the upper angles of T. A compact surface with an intrinsic metric (X,d) is said to have bounded integral curvature if there is a constant C such that for any finite family (Ti) of disjoint "nice enough" triangles, [formula].

Compact Alexandrov surfaces with curvature bounded from below are compact Alexandrov surfaces with bounded integral curvature, a proof of this fact can be found in [\cite=MR1643359]. Alexandrov surfaces with bounded integral curvature have well defined notions of area and curvature, which are measures on the surface (signed measure for the curvature). In the case of compact smooth surfaces (M,g), these measures coincide with the usual notions of volume form dvg and curvature measure Kgdvg, see [\cite=MR0216434], chapters 5 and 8.

First we need a theorem on the approximation of compact Alexandrov surfaces with curvature bounded from below by smooth surfaces :

For any compact Alexandrov surface with curvature bounded from below by k (X,d), there exist a sequence of smooth compact Riemannian surfaces [formula] satisfying :

Kgi  ≥  k

[formula]

[formula]

which Gromov-Hausdorff converges to (X,d).

This theorem doesn't seem to have been explicitely stated before. When k = 0, it follows from the theorem of Alexandrov on the approximation of convex surfaces by convex polyhedra, which is proved in chapter 7, section 6 of [\cite=MR2193913], and the fact that convex polyhedra can be approximated by smooth convex surfaces. When the curvature bound is not 0, one has to approximate the surface by polyhedra whose faces are geodesic triangle in a space form of curvature k.

The next theorem shows that the curvature measure and the area measure depend continuously on the distance, this is Theorem 6, p. 240 and Theorem 9 p. 269 in [\cite=MR0216434].

Le [formula] and d be distances on a compact surface M such that :

(M,d) and each of the (M,di) are Alexandrov surfaces of bounded integral curvature.

as functions on M  ×  M, the distances di uniformly converges to d.

Then the curvature measures dωi of (M,di) weakly converges to the curvature measure dω of (M,d), that is, for any continuous φ function on M :

[formula]

Moreover, the area measure dσi of di weakly converge to the area measure dσ of d.

Our aim now is to present a partial converse of the previous theorem. In the sequel, h is a fixed smooth Riemannian metric on M. We consider the space Pot(M,h) of L1 functions u on M whose distributional laplacian with respect to h is a signed measure dμ on M, we say that u is the potential of dμ. Such a u is the difference of two subharmonic functions and has a representative which is well defined outside a set of Hausdorff dimension 0 in M.

The volume of u is defined by [formula]. Given a zero mass signed measure dμ and V > 0, dμ has a unique potential uμ,V of volume V. We will denote by dμ = dμ+ - dμ- the Jordan decomposition of μ. Reshetnyak has studied the non-smooth Riemannian metric e2uh. We have ([\cite=MR1263964] Theorem 7.1.1, [\cite=2009arXiv0906.3407T] Proposition 5.3) :

Let u∈Pot(M,h) be a potential of dμ. Assume that dμ+({x}) < 2π for any x∈M. Define :

[formula]

where Γ(x,y) is the space of C1 paths γ from

[formula]

We are now ready to state the converse of Theorem [\ref=thmCVdist]. This is Theorem 7.3.1 in [\cite=MR1263964], see also [\cite=2009arXiv0906.3407T], Theorem 6.2.

Let (M,h) be a smooth Riemannian surface and [formula] [formula] be two sequences of (nonnegative) measures which weakly converge to dμ+ and dμ- and such that dμi(M) and dμi(M) are equal and bounded independently of i.

Let Vi be a sequence of positive numbers converging to V. Let ui be the potential of dμi = dμ+i - dμ-i of volume Vi and u be the potential of dμ = dμ+ - dμ- of volume V.

Assume that dμ({x}) < 2π for all x∈M. Then the distances dh,ui uniformly converge as i goes to infinity to the distance dh,u.

In the case of surfaces with curvature bounded from below, the condition dμ({x}) < 2π is automatically fulfilled. In fact, it follows from the discussion on "complete angles at a point" in [\cite=MR0216434] (Chapter 2 Section 5 and Chapter 4 Section 4) that if the curvature dω({x}) of a point x in (M,d) is 2π, then any two shortest paths γ1 and γ2 emanating of x will make a 0 angle at x. Since when the curvature is bounded from below this angle has to be greater than the comparison triangle, this is impossible.

Then next theorem, due to Huber says that the distance dh,u determines the conformal class of h, see [\cite=MR1263964] Theorem 7.1.3 or [\cite=2009arXiv0906.3407T] Theorem 6.4.

Let (M,h) and (M',h') be two compact Riemannian surfaces, u∈Pot(M,h) and u'∈Pot(M',h'). Assume f is an isometry from (M,dh,u) to (M',dh',u'), the f is a conformal diffeomorphism from (M,h) to (M',h').
