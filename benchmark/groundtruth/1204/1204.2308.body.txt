Near-infrared observations of type Ia supernovae: The best known standard candle for cosmology

Introduction

SNe Ia are widely accepted to be excellent standardizable candles at optical wavelengths. The development of various empirical corrections, which can relate peak luminosity and light-curve shape [\citep=phillips1993absolute] [\citep=hamuy1996bvri], SN colour [\citep=tripp1998two] [\citep=jha2007improved], spectral information [\citep=bronder2007snls] [\citep=walker2011supernova] [\citep=silver2012berkeley] and host-galaxy mass [\citep=sullivan2010dependence], allow SNe Ia peak magnitudes to serve as distance indicators with a corrected scatter of as low as 0.13 magnitudes [\citep=silver2012berkeley] [\citep=conley2011supernova]. There has been growing evidence, though, that SNe Ia may be more accurate in the near-infrared (NIR) (for a recent review, see [\citealt=phillips2011near]). Near-infrared light experiences less attenuation from dust than light at optical wavelengths, and theoretical models predict a smaller intrinsic dispersion in the near-infrared peak magniude [\citep=kasen2006secondary]. Furthermore, there appears to be little or no relationship between light-curve shape and peak luminosity [\citep=wood2008type] [\citep=folatelli2010carnegie] [\citep=mandel2011type], meaning no empirical corrections need be applied. Recent studies [\citep=meikle2000absolute] [\citep=wood2008type] [\citep=folatelli2010carnegie] [\citep=krisciunas2004hubble] [\citep=kattner2012standardizability] [\citep=mandel2011type] have shown that SNe Ia in the NIR can be as reliable as corrected SNe Ia observed at optical wavelengths, but these studies have had some limitations. Foremost among these limitations is that the SNe were observed at distances that are not sufficiently large to place them in the Hubble flow (defined here as z  >  0.03) and hence are affected by peculiar velocities. Here we present a study of a sample of Type Ia SNe selected to lie exclusively in the redshift range 0.03  <  z < 0.09 in order to minimise redshift uncertainty due to peculiar velocity. We use NIR images on 8m class telescopes to observe supernovae in our sample, resulting in photometry that is more precise than that achieved for the handful of supernovae that have been observed beyond z  =  0.03.

SNe Ia sample

The SNe Ia used in our sample are summarised in Table [\ref=Table:resultsH&J]. These SNe Ia were discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF; [\citealt=rau2009exploring] [\citealt=law2009palomar]), spectroscopically confirmed, observed in the g,r,i bands (Maguire et al. in prep.) at the Liverpool Telescope and followed up in both the NIR J and H bands, each with four epochs of observation. PTF09dlc was observed using HAWK-I [\citep=casali2006hawk] on ESO's 8.1m VLT, and all others were observed using NIRI, the NIR Imager and Spectrometer [\citep=hodapp2000gemini] on Gemini Observatory's 8.2m Gemini North. Reference images were taken ~  1 year after initial observations so that host-galaxy light could be removed. The data were processed in a standard manner using IRAF and our own scripts. Darks were used to remove the pedestal, and flats were used to remove pixel-to-pixel sensitivity variations. We used the XDIMSUM package in IRAF to remove the sky and a modified version of ISIS2 [\citep=alard2000image] to subtract the reference image of each SN from the images with SN light, leaving just light of the SN. Zero-points were derived from standards found in the [\citet=persson1998new] catalogue. All magnitudes are reported in the natural system of each instrument. K-corrections were calculated using the revised spectral template of [\citet=hsiao2007k] and corrections for galactic dust extinction were applied. We did not warp the spectral template to match the observed colour. For the SNe PTF09dlc, PTF10hmv, PTF10mwb, PTF10nlg, PTF10tce, PTF10ufj, PTF10wnm and PTF10xyt, the first observing epoch was before NIR maximum. For the remaining SNe, the first observing epoch was near NIR maximum. When fitting light-curves for the SNe, we included the date of B-band maximum as an extra prior. The B-band maximum was determined using SiFTO [\citep=conley2008sifto], as was the B-band stretch (Maguire et al. in prep.). The B-band stretches range from 0.8 to 1.15, so there are no fast decliners in our sample. Nor are there any heavily reddened supernovae. Furthermore, all of the SNe appear to be spectroscopically normal. The absence of fast decliners and heavily reddened SNe is a potential limitation of the current sample. The photometry for all SNe is presented in Table [\ref=table:photometry].

Template Fitting

To find the light-curve maxima, we fit the Flexible Light-curve InfraRed Template (FLIRT) presented in [\citet=mandel2009type] to our K-corrected photometry. As we did not observe all SNe Ia before maximum light, we fit the template to the data with an additional constraint. Concurrent observations of SNe Ia at NIR and optical wavelengths provide evidence that NIR maxima occur ~  5 days before B-band maximum [\citep=meikle2000absolute] [\citep=krisciunas2004hubble]. We use this prior assumption as a constraint on the date of NIR maximum, tp, with a 1 - σ error of σp  =   1 day, imposed on the likelihood function. By fitting the light-curve template to the SNe Ia observed before maximum without a prior, we determine that the J-band maximum occurs 5.36 days before the B-band maximum with a standard deviation of 0.74 days and the H-band maximum occurs 4.28 days before with a standard deviation of 0.70 days. Figure [\ref=fig:lc] displays the template-fitted light-curve for PTF10tce. The errors in the peak apparent magnitudes in both the J and H band were calculated via 100 Monte Carlo simulations of template fitting to the data, including repeated Gaussian-distributed random samplings within the errors of each point. To convert apparent magnitudes to absolute magnitudes, we determine the distance modulus for each SN, calculated using the standard flat cosmology of [formula]. The redshift measurement for PTF10ufj is uncertain since the redshift is measured from the supernova and not the host. In this case, we have assumed an uncertainty of σz  =  0.005 (Maguire et al. in prep.). For all other redshifts, the errors make negligible difference to the distance modulus.

Results

The peak apparent magnitudes for each SN Ia in the J and H band are quoted in Table [\ref=Table:resultsH&J]. In the H band, the median absolute magnitude of the supernovae in our sample is [formula]. This compares reasonably well with the median magnitudes of supernovae in [\cite=folatelli2010carnegie], [\citet=wood2008type] and [\citet=krisciunas2004hubble] for which we derive [formula], [formula], and [formula], respectively. The errors on the median are computed by jackknife resampling. In part, the difference in magnitudes comes from the limited number of supernovae in each of the samples. The differences may also be due to the differences in the photometric systems that each author adopts. These differences are generally smaller than 0.04 mag. In the J band, the variations between samples are larger and more difficult to understand. We find a median magnitude of [formula], compared to median magnitudes of [formula], [formula], and [formula] for the supernovae in [\cite=folatelli2010carnegie], [\citet=wood2008type] and [\citet=krisciunas2004hubble]. The errors were calculated as for the H band. The largest source of uncertainty is due to sample size. Difference due to photometric systems are generally smaller. In order to constrain the dark energy equation of state beyond limits currently derived using supernovae observed in the optical, the mean magnitude needs to be determined to a level of accuracy that is better than 0.01 mag. The J- and H-band Hubble diagrams are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:hubble_H]. Our results are compared with the surveys of [\citet=wood2008type] and [\citet=folatelli2010carnegie]. Our observed scatter about the mean absolute magnitude of [formula] mag and σJ  =  0.116  ±  0.027 mag represent a considerable improvement on previous samples, including [\citet=wood2008type] who observed [formula] mag and σJ  =  0.41 mag, [\citet=krisciunas2004hubble] who observed [formula] mag and σJ  =  0.13 mag, [\citet=folatelli2010carnegie] who observed [formula] mag and σJ  =  0.37 mag and [\citet=mandel2009type] who observed [formula] mag and σJ  =  0.17 mag. The values for [formula] and [formula] presented here are the scatter in the magnitude at J-max and H-max, respectively. Photometric errors make little contribution to the scatter we measure. Peculiar velocities only make a significant contribution if they are large (i.e. ~  300km s- 1). The intrinsic scatters we measure, assuming peculiar velocities of 300 km s- 1 are [formula] in the J band and [formula] in the H band. For peculiar velocities of 150 km s- 1 we obtain intrinsic scatters of [formula] in the J band and [formula] in the H band. Part of the scatter we observe may also be due to spectral variability affecting the K-corrections. We note that the light-curves of some of the SN in our sample are not adequately described by the light-curve template that we have used. This is because there is a diversity in light-curve shapes, which may lead to opportunities to reduce the scatter about the Hubble line further. We investigated this by recomputing the scatter after removing SNe with poor light-curve fits. If we eliminate light-curves with a χ2  /  Degrees of Freedom greater than 5 (a chance probability of Q  =  0.002), we reject PTF09dlc and PTF10mwb in the J band and PF09dlc, PTF10hmv and PTF10mwb in the H band. The resulting values of scatter in the J and H bands are 0.105 and 0.097 respectively. The scatter in the H band increases marginally but is noticeably lower for the J band. PTF09dlc, PTF10hmv and PTF10mwb exhibit no spectral or B-band light-curve peculiarities. However, applying such cuts for the purpose of reducing the scatter needs to be done with care since they may introduce biases that may affect the accuracy with which cosmological parameters can be measured. The relationship between the peak magnitude in both filters and pseudo-colour ([formula]-[formula]) was also considered. In the optical, there is a strong correlation between colour and luminosity [\citep=tripp1998two] [\citep=jha2007improved]. However, we find no obvious correlation between the H-band residual and J[formula]-H[formula] pseudo-colour in our sample. On the other hand, we do find a correlation between the J-band residual and pseudo-colour. From the least-squares residuals in the y-direction, we find a relation for the line of best fit, where the errors on the coefficients are 1 - σ dispersions calculated via 1000 Monte Carlo simulations by randomly varying the points within their error bars:

[formula]

with a scatter about the line of best fit of σ  =  0.071. We also considered the relationship between the peak magnitude in both filters with the angular distance between the SN and the centre of the host galaxy and B-band stretch. However, we find no correlations between any of these quantities. It should be noted that the B-band stretch range covered by this sample is limited.

Template fitting with a subset of points

The previous discussion refers to SNe Ia light-curves consisting of 4 data points, which we used to fit the light-curve templates. In this section we discuss the optimal number of epochs that should be observed in the NIR given finite telescope time. We have already calculated the peak magnitude, [formula], for each SNe Ia using all data available. We now calculate the peak magnitudes using a subset of the data points of size x, denoted by Mx - pts, and find the scatter of these magnitudes around [formula]. The total scatter in the sample using x points is denoted by [formula]. The results for these quantities based on our SNe Ia sample are presented in Table [\ref=Table:4ptsJ]. We find in all cases that there is approximately one-hundredth of a magnitude difference in the mean peak magnitude or less between different numbers of epochs used. However there is additional scatter around the mean which decreases as more points are added. This illustrates the exchange between amount of telescope time used and dispersion measured. Table [\ref=Table:4ptsJ] suggests that the increased accuracy from 3 points to 4 is ~  0.01 mag or less in both the J and H bands. Furthermore, using just one point with a known date of maximum can be used while only sacrificing ~  0.04 mag of accuracy (i.e. 1-σ scatter) in both the J and H bands. Importantly, using just one point in the J band gives a dispersion that is similar to the best standardized SNe Ia observed in the optical, and using just one point in the H band can further improve the accuracy of SNe Ia observed in the optical. We also find that, within the range of epochs covered by our data (approximately 10 days before to 15 days after B-band maximum), the amount of additional scatter introduced due to using only one point has no dependence on when this point is taken with respect to B-band maximum. Importantly, single observations after B-band peak are equally as effective as points prior to the peak. We may now compare the standard error of the mean (SEM) for each subset of points. The SEM for a sample of n points is given by,

[formula]

where σ is the standard deviation of the sample. As an illustrative example, we compare observing 3 SNe over 4 epochs, observing 4 SNe over 3 epochs, observing 6 SNe over 2 epochs and observing 12 SNe for a single epoch. In all cases, we assume that we have well-sampled optical light-curves for each SN Ia. Each of these would require equal allocation of telescope time. The relative SEM for each method are summarised in Table [\ref=Table:relSEM]. We find that observing four times the number of SNe with only a single epoch delivers a lower SEM than observing fewer SNe over more than one epoch. The larger sample size more than compensates for the higher uncertainty in the peak magnitude.

Conclusion

We have presented NIR light curves of 12 SNe Ia that are in the Hubble flow. We find that the intrinsic scatter in peak luminosities of type Ia supernovae in the NIR J and H bands are smaller than previously thought. This is the first sample to display an H-band rms scatter as small as [formula] (with a median peak magnitude of [formula]). Our observed J-band rms scatter of [formula] (with a median peak magnitude of [formula]) is smaller than reported elsewhere. These results provide distance errors of ~  4% using H band SNe, making them the most precise standard candles for cosmology. We have also shown that if concurrent optical observations are made, we may use a predicted date of NIR maximum as a constraint when fitting the light-curve. With this constraint, we may use as few as one NIR observation within ~  5 - 10 days of NIR max per supernova while still achieving scatters of [formula] and σJ  =  0.146. As surveys improve over the coming years and more SNe Ia are discovered, single-night near-infrared observations undertaken concurrently with optical observations will be the most efficient and accurate way to construct samples.
