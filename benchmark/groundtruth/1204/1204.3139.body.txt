Volume-preserving actions of simple algebraic [formula]-groups on low-dimensional manifolds

Introduction

The second author has conjectured that if [formula] is a simple algebraic [formula]-group, and [formula], then every C∞, volume-preserving action of the arithmetic group [formula] on an compact manifold of small dimension must be finite. (This means that the action factors through the action of a finite group. See [\cite=Fisher-AroundZimmer] for a precise statement of the conjecture and a survey of progress on this problem.) In this paper, we show that known results imply the analogue of the conjecture with [formula] in the place of [formula]. For example, we establish:

[formula] has no nontrivial, C∞, volume-preserving action on any compact manifold of dimension strictly less than n.

[formula] contains large finite subgroups whenever n is large (such as an elementary abelian group of order 2n - 1). Therefore, topological arguments imply that if M is any compact manifold, then there is some n, such that [formula] has no nontrivial, C0 action on M (see [\cite=MannSu-ActionsOfPGrps]). However, unlike in , the value of n depends on details of the topology of M, not just its dimension, because every finite group acts freely on some compact, connected, 2-dimensional manifold [\cite=FarbMargalit-MappingClassGrps].

The nontrivial part of (namely, when n  ≥  3) is a special case of the following much more general result:

Assume:

[formula] is an isotropic, almost-simple, linear algebraic group over [formula], such that, for every place v of [formula], the [formula]-rank of every simple factor of [formula] is at least two,

[formula], such that there are no nontrivial, continuous homomorphisms from [formula] to [formula], and

G is a subgroup of finite index in [formula].

Then every C∞, volume-preserving action of G on any d-dimensional compact manifold M is finite.

Assume, for simplicity, that [formula] is connected. Then the assumption that [formula] is isotropic can be eliminated if we add two hypotheses on the universal cover [formula]: Both of these hypotheses are known to be true unless [formula] is anisotropic of type An, D4, or E6. See for more details.

Proof of

Assume the situation of . By passing to a subgroup of finite index, we assume that [formula] is connected.

[formula] is the universal cover of [formula]. (We may realize [formula] as a Zariski-closed subgroup of [formula], for some N [\cite=Humphreys-AlgicGrps], so [formula] is defined for any integral domain R of characteristic zero.)

[formula] is the natural homomorphism.

[formula] is the kernel of π (so [formula] is a finite, central [formula]-subgroup of [formula]).

If S is any finite set of prime numbers:

[formula] is the ring of S-integers. That is, [formula], where [formula].

[formula], so Γ S is an S-arithmetic subgroup of [formula].

S is the profinite completion of Γ S.

[formula] is the ring of p-adic integers, for any prime p.

We begin by recalling a few well-known facts about [formula]:

Every proper, normal subgroup of [formula] is contained in the center of [formula], and is therefore finite.

[formula].

[formula] is an abelian group whose exponent divides [formula]. (In particular, [formula] is a normal subgroup of [formula].)

([\ref=G/Univ-simple]) See [\cite=Gille-KneserTits]. This relies on our assumption that [formula] is isotropic.

([\ref=G/Univ-inG]) Since G has finite index in [formula], it contains a finite-index subgroup of [formula]. However, we know from ([\ref=G/Univ-simple]) that [formula] has no proper subgroups of finite index. Therefore G must contain all of [formula].

([\ref=G/Univ-abel]) We have the following long exact sequence of Galois cohomology groups [\cite=PlatonovRapinchukBook]:

[formula]

In other words,

[formula]

Since [formula] is central in [formula], it is easy to see that the connecting map δ is a group homomorphism. Therefore, the desired conclusion follows from the observation that multiplication by [formula] annihilates the abelian group [formula].

Since [formula], and G acts on M, ([\ref=G/Univ-inG]) provides an action of Γ S on M (for any S). The following theorem about this action requires our assumption that there are no nontrivial, continuous homomorphisms from [formula] to [formula]. It also uses our assumption that simple factors of [formula] have rank at least two. (This implies that [formula] has Kazhdan's property (T).)

If S is any finite set of prime numbers, then there exist

a continuous action of a compact group KS on a compact metric space XS, and

a homomorphism φS:Γ S  →  KS,

such that the resulting action of Γ S on XS is measurably isomorphic (a.e.) to the action of Γ S on M.

We may assume that φS(Γ S) is dense in KS. This implies:

KS is profinite.

It is an easy consequence of the Peter-Weyl Theorem that every compact group is a projective limit of compact Lie groups [\cite=HofmannMorris-CpctGrps]. However, since [formula] has no compact factors, the Margulis Superrigidity Theorem [\cite=MargulisBook] tells us that any homomorphism from Γ S into a compact Lie group must have finite image. Since φS(Γ S) is dense in KS, this implies that KS is a projective limit of finite groups, as desired.

Therefore, we may assume KS is the profinite completion  S of Γ S. We have the following well-known description of  S (because [formula] is isotropic).

Fix a prime number q  ≠  2. The inclusion Γ {2}  ⊂  Γ {2,q} provides us with an action of Γ {2} on X{2,q}, but this must be isomorphic to the action of Γ {2} on X{2} (since both are isomorphic to the action on M). Therefore, the action of  {2} on X{2} must factor through  {2,q} (a.e.). Furthermore, if we use to identify  S with [formula], then it is obvious that [formula] is in the kernel of the homomorphism  {2}  →   {2,q}. Therefore, [formula] acts trivially on X{2} (a.e.).

Since the subgroups [formula] generate a dense subgroup of [formula], we conclude that  {2} acts trivially (a.e.). Therefore, Γ {2} acts trivially on M (not just a.e., because Γ {2} acts continuously on M), so the action of [formula] has an infinite kernel. Hence, ([\ref=G/Univ-simple]) implies that the kernel is all of [formula]. This means that [formula] acts trivially on M.

So the action of G factors through [formula]. From ([\ref=G/Univ-abel]), we know that this quotient is an abelian group of finite exponent, so the corollary of the following theorem tells us that the action is finite.

If A is any abelian group of prime exponent, then every C0 action of A on any compact manifold is finite.

If A is any abelian group of finite exponent, then every C0 action of A on any compact manifold is finite.

We can assume the exponent of A is a power of a prime p (because A is the direct product of its finitely many Sylow subgroups). We can also assume that the action of A is faithful, so the theorem tells us that A has only finitely many elements of order p. This means the kernel of the homomorphism x  ↦  xp is finite, so it is easy to prove by induction that A has only finitely many elements of any order pk. Since A has finite exponent, this implies that A is finite.

This completes the proof of . We now discuss the generalization described in .

The assumption that [formula] is isotropic was used in only two places: the projective simplicity of [formula] (([\ref=G/Univ-simple])) and .

The projective simplicity is known to be true unless [formula] is anisotropic of type An, [formula], or E6 [\cite=PlatonovRapinchukBook]. (Projective simplicity obviously fails if there is a nonarchimedean place v, such that [formula] has a compact factor [\cite=PlatonovRapinchukBook]. However, compact nonarchimedean factors cannot arise unless [formula] is of type An [\cite=PlatonovRapinchukBook]. In any case, we have ruled out compact factors by requiring the simple factors of [formula] to have rank at least 2.) When there are no compact factors, projective simplicity is also known to be true for inner forms of type [formula] [\cite=Rapinchuk-CSP].

For the Congruence Subgroup Property, it suffices to assume that every prime number q is contained in a finite set S of prime numbers, such that the congruence kernel [formula] is central. (This condition is known to be true unless [formula] is anisotropic of type An, D4, or E6 [\cite=PlatonovRapinchukBook]. In fact, for our purposes, it would suffice to know that [formula] is abelian.) To see that this assumption suffices, note that, for any finite set S of prime numbers, Strong Approximation [\cite=PlatonovRapinchukBook] tells us [formula]. In particular, [formula], so, for each prime q, we may let [formula] be the inverse image of [formula] in [formula]. The homomorphism [formula] must map [formula] into [formula] for all q∈S. If [formula] is abelian, this implies that the image of the commutator subgroup

[formula]

acts trivially on M. This is sufficient to show that [formula] acts trivially.
