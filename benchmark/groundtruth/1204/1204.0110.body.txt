Badly approximable vectors on a vertical Cantor set

Introduction

Let i,j be such that

[formula]

[formula]

and we agree that [formula] and [formula], where [formula] is the classical set of badly approximable numbers.

Schmidt's conjecture was concerned with the intersection between two different [formula]'s. It was proved by Badziahin-Pollington-Velani in [\cite=Badziahin]. Actually, they proved

Let [formula] be as in ([\ref=ij]). Assume

[formula]

Then

[formula]

This solves Schmidt's conjecture about simultaneous Diophantine approximations. In fact, to prove this theorem, Badziahin-Pollington-Velani proved a theorem about the intersection of [formula] with certain vertical intervals. To state it, first let us make the following definition:

Let [formula]. The set of badly approximable numbers with weight i is

[formula]

where we agree on [formula].

Notice that for any i1  ≤  i2, [formula], [formula], and that for i > 1, [formula].

Let [formula] be as in ([\ref=ij]). Denote [formula] and assume ([\ref=badCondition]). Assume

[formula]

and let

[formula]

Then,

[formula]

In this paper we strengthen this result in two directions. The first direction is to consider the intersection of [formula] with certain fractals. We will use a measure that is supported on the fractal. See [\cite=KW], [\cite=KTV] for more on this subject, and [\cite=icm2010] for a broader point of view.

Let X be a metric space, μ a Borel measure. μ satisfies a power law if there are positive β,b1,b2 such that [formula],

[formula]

Using this property we prove

Let i,j∈[0,1] be as in ([\ref=ij]), θ as in ([\ref=theta]) and Θ be as in ([\ref=Theta]). Assume [formula] is the support of a probability measure μ on Θ, which satisfies a power law with exponent β. Then for any β' < β, there exists a measure ν satisfying a power law with exponent bigger than β', such that

[formula]

In particular,

[formula]

This result with [formula] is the case of a single [formula] in Theorem [\ref=BPV2]. Badziahin-Pollington-Velani asked whether ([\ref=5.5]) is true without assuming ([\ref=badCondition]). Our second strengthening of [\cite=Badziahin] provides a partial result to this question.

Let [formula] be the support of a measure satisfying a power law, and let [formula] with [formula] as in ([\ref=ij]). Then

[formula]

Using the techniques of this article one cannot give a result about the dimension of the infinite intersection. Recently, Jinpeng An[\cite=JinpengAn] proved that in the case [formula],

[formula]

which in particular implies that any countable intersection of such sets is not empty. In [\ref=abswin], which is joint with Barak Weiss, we use Jinpeng An's result and method in order to prove

[formula]

which easily gives also a dimension result in the context of Theorem [\ref=ourThm].

The structure of this paper is the following. In Section [\ref=mainTheorem] we prove Theorem [\ref=dim] assuming Theorem [\ref=main_thm] which will be stated there. The proof uses the method developed in [\cite=Badziahin], and some propositions from that paper are used without proof. In section [\ref=conclusions] we prove Theorem [\ref=ourThm]. In Section [\ref=mainKey] we prove the crucial Theorem [\ref=main_thm] that is used in Section [\ref=mainTheorem].

Main Theorem

Before we give the proof of Theorem [\ref=dim], we need some notations and lemmata. For any c > 0 define

[formula]

We remark that here we use the dual formulation for [formula]. By using a transference principle (cf. e.g. [\cite=Badziahin], Appendix), we note that

[formula]

Viewing it in this form, we see that ([\ref=theta]) is a necessary condition on θ for the existence of a [formula] such that [formula]. For any [formula]

[formula]

For [formula], we see that a line

[formula]

intersects Θ at a point (θ,y(L)) where

[formula]

Denote by Δ(L) the points (θ,y)∈Θ that are not in [formula] because they are too close to (θ,y(L)), that is

[formula]

Dividing by B we get

[formula]

where if I is an interval then |I| is the diameter of I, and

[formula]

The plan is to prove that after removing all intervals Δ(L), still most of [formula] is not removed. We do it by constructing (recursively) a sequence of collections of disjoint intervals [formula], for which

[formula]

such that

[formula]

where [formula] (c1 is defined below in ([\ref=c1])), yJ∈J' and J satisfies

[formula]

and [formula] is a fixed integer that we choose later (cf. ([\ref=Rtotal])). [formula] so by definition, there exists c(θ) that fulfils

[formula]

Note that for any c  ≤  c(θ) it is enough to consider only lines L(A,B,C) with

[formula]

This is the place to note that in the case i = 1,j = 0 we have [formula], and the assertion of the theorem is classical. In the other extreme, i = 0,j = 1 we actually have [formula]. Although we could modify the construction to deal with this case (cf. [\cite=Badziahin], Chap. 3.2), we note that the assertion of the theorem in this case is already known, proved independently in [\cite=KW] and [\cite=KTV]. We proceed assuming i,j  ≠  0. Let

[formula]

where

[formula]

Then,

[formula]

We start the construction by looking at the following collection of closed subintervals of Θ,

[formula]

By the 5r-covering lemma ([\cite=Mattila], Chap. 2), choose a set of disjoint subintervals I0  ⊆  0 such that

[formula]

where if I = B(y,r), [formula] then γI = B(y,γr). In particular [formula], since μ is a probability measure. For every I∈I0, |I| = c1. Using the right hand side of ([\ref=powerLawEq]) we get [formula] and

[formula]

where #   denotes the number of elements of a finite set. Set J0  =  I0. This finishes the construction of the zero'th level. Let [formula] and assume that we are given the collections In,Jn and that Jn satisfies ([\ref=inhyp1]). Denote the collection of lines we should avoid in the (n + 1)'th step by

[formula]

where

[formula]

Notice that, using ([\ref=dlLength]) and the definition of c in ([\ref=c]), a line L∈C(n) satisfies

[formula]

For each I∈In define the subinterval

[formula]

The motivation for that is to ensure that every two disjoint intervals I1,I2∈In and a line L∈C(n) satisfy

[formula]

and that for every I∈In,

[formula]

Next, for every I'∈In we define the intermediate collection

[formula]

Apply the 5r-covering lemma to n + 1(I') to get a disjoint collection of subintervals In + 1(I') such that

[formula]

Define

[formula]

[formula]

Note that [formula] and by ([\ref=powerLaw]), for every I∈In + 1(I'), [formula] so

[formula]

For the ease of calculations, take R such that [formula] and [formula] so

[formula]

To define Jn + 1, we remove intervals I∈In + 1(J) that intersect some Δ(L) for a line L∈C(n), that is

[formula]

We must show that [formula], but in order to construct a measure with its support in [formula] it is not enough to have an estimate on #  Jn. Rather, it is necessary to know more about the structure of [formula]. Namely, we wish to use the notion of a tree-like family as in [\cite=KW]. Unfortunately, {Jn} might have finite branches and we must pass to a subcollection. Following [\cite=Badziahin], define,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Recall that for L(A,B,C)∈C(n), [formula] since ([\ref=line1]) is satisfied, and

[formula]

so [formula]. Therefore, [formula] is empty for [formula] and for [formula], so

[formula]

The following theorem is most important for our proof and Section [\ref=mainKey] is devoted to it.

Let [formula], [formula], and [formula]. Let

[formula]

and R  ≥  R1 where

[formula]

R0 is the solution of the equation

[formula]

and c5 is as in ([\ref=c5]). Then,

[formula]

where In + 1(J)  =  {I∈In + 1:I  ⊆  J} (For J∈Jn this definition for In + 1(J) coincides with the definition in ([\ref=inplus1j])).

Informally speaking, Theorem [\ref=main_thm] says that our family Jn is a tree, for which every father has more than [formula] children (cf. ([\ref=jnNum])), minus Rβ  -  ε vertices that may be removed by every father from every generation that descends it. (more precisely, a father in the n0'th generation, is able to remove children from the n'th generation whenever n > n0 satisfies [formula] that is [formula].) In this situation it may be the case that some J∈Jn doesn't contain even a single element from Jn + 1. Nevertheless, there exists a subcollection on which the number of children is bounded from below.

A tree-like family of intervals is a union of collections of closed intervals [formula] such that T0  =  {J0} and it satisfies the following:

[formula].

[formula].

[formula].

[formula], where

[formula]

For [formula], the tree-like family is called r-regular or regular of degree r if for every [formula]

[formula]

The following property is proved in ([\cite=Badziahin], Chap.7, Lemma 4). We present the proof again to extend its context to ours.

Let J0∈J0, ε as in ([\ref=epsilon0]), R  ≥   max {R1,R2} where R1 is as in ([\ref=R1]), and

[formula]

Let T be a regular tree-like subfamily of [formula] of degree [formula] with T0  =  {J0}. Then, [formula]

[formula]

Define the sequence

[formula]

Using induction we will show that for every [formula],

[formula]

Assume [formula]. We will bound from above the number of intervals from Tn + 1 that aren't in Jn + 1. By ([\ref=main_thm_eq]) we know that for each [formula], each father from [formula] generations above can remove no more than Rβ  -  ε intervals from each level of its successor. Considering the fact that only fathers from our T participate in that, the number of intervals that may be removed in this way is less than

[formula]

Repeatedly using the induction hypothesis up to n, we have

[formula]

Using ([\ref=R2]) and ([\ref=epsilon0]) we get [formula] so

[formula]

Finally,

[formula]

In particular f(n) > 0 and we are done.

Let F be a tree and assume T  ⊆  F is a subtree. For [formula], T is said to have r-ubiquity with respect to F if every regular tree of degree r, Fr  ⊆  F, satisfies

[formula]

where Fr(n) and T(n) stands for the sets of vertices in the n'th generation of the tree.

Inspired by subsection 7.3 in [\cite=Badziahin], we prove the following

Assume [formula], Fr0 is a regular tree of degree r0, and T  ⊆  Fr0 is a tree with r-ubiquity with respect to Fr0. Then there exists a regular tree of degree r0 - r + 1 that is contained in T.

It is enough to prove the existence of a finite tree of any length. Indeed, assume we have a collection of regular subtrees of degree r0 - r + 1 of every length, [formula]. Generate an infinite tree T∞ by choosing the first generation of it to be r0 - r + 1 vertices that appear infinitely many times in the finite trees Tn. Continue by induction, and choose the m'th level of T∞ to be vertices that appear infinitely many times in the trees {Tn}n  ≥  m that have the same m - 1 level as T∞.

To prove existence of a tree of any finite length, we argue by induction on the length. For a tree of length 0 the assertion is empty. Assume that every tree of length n with r-ubiquity contains a regular subtree of degree r0 - r + 1, and look at our tree T up to level n + 1. For at least r0 - r + 1 vertices of the first generation, v∈T(1), the tree Tv, which starts in v and contains every vertex of T that have v as its ancestor, has r-ubiquity. Otherwise, construct a regular tree of degree r that contradicts r-ubiquity by choosing its first level to be r vertices for which Tv doesn't have r-ubiquity. For every such v there exists a regular subtree Fr,v and [formula] such that [formula]. This defines a tree Fr for which we have

[formula]

where n =  max v∈T(1){nv}, and therefore contradicts r-ubiquity of T. Now, to construct a regular tree we can choose r0 - r + 1 vertices v from T(1) for which Tv has r-ubiquity. Use the induction hypothesis to find a regular tree of degree r0 - r + 1 in each Tv and use it to continue our regular tree up to level n + 1. Thus we have found a regular tree of degree r0 - r + 1 and of length n + 1 which is contained in T.

Let ε be as in ([\ref=epsilon0]), let R1,R2 be as in ([\ref=R1]) and ([\ref=R2]). Let

[formula]

where [formula]. Now take any regular subtree I' of I with degree [formula]. There exists such a subtree because of ([\ref=jnNum]). It is clear from Lemma [\ref=ubique] that the family [formula] has r-ubiquity with respect to I', with [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=rubiquity] we can choose a collection n  ~    ⊆    ~  Jn such that for every J'∈n,

[formula]

where the last inequality is true because R  ≥  R3. Let [formula] be such that Mn  ⊆  n for every [formula] and equality holds in ([\ref=numMtilde]), i.e.,

[formula]

Note that we use M0  =  J0, but for calculating dimension we can ignore any finite number of levels of the construction. Denote

[formula]

To define the measure we want on Kc we use the following standard lemma, proved in [\ref=treeLikeAppendix]:

Let [formula] be a tree-like family of intervals. Assume that there exists [formula] and γ,R > 0 such that [formula], J∈Tn

[formula]

[formula]

Then there exists a measure ν with [formula] satisfying a power law with exponent β  =   log R(γR).

[formula] satisfies the conditions of Lemma [\ref=treeDim] with [formula] and n0 = 1. Therefore for every R as in ([\ref=Rtotal]) and c = c(R) as in ([\ref=c]) there exists a measure μc on Kc satisfying a power law with an exponent

[formula]

lim R  →    ∞βc(R)  =  β so we have proved the main part of Theorem [\ref=dim]. [formula] so using the easy part of Frostman's lemma ([\cite=Mattila], Chap. 8), we get [formula] for every R as in ([\ref=Rtotal]), so [formula].

Conclusions

In proving Theorem [\ref=ourThm] we need to be a little bit careful because of the fact that the sets [formula] are not closed. Instead, we work with the support of the measure constructed in Theorem [\ref=dim].

Let ε > 0. Use Theorem [\ref=dim] to find a measure μ1 satisfying a power law with exponent [formula] with [formula]. Generally, given [formula] and a measure μn satisfying [formula], use Theorem [\ref=dim] for t = n + 1 and [formula], to find a measure μn + 1 with [formula] satisfying a power law with exponent [formula]. Note that for any [formula],

[formula]

so in particular, by compactness of Θ,

[formula]

Proof Of Theorem 8

Following Badziahin-Pollington-Velani, define

[formula]

Then by ([\ref=Cn]) and ([\ref=Cnl]) we have

[formula]

To prove Theorem [\ref=main_thm], it'll be enough to prove

Let [formula], and [formula]. For ε,R that satisfy

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Let ε0 be as in ([\ref=epsilon0]) and

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

so substituting ε  =  ε1 in the conditions of Theorem [\ref=thm4], it is enough to ask for the simpler conditions

[formula]

[formula]

Let R  ≥  R1 where R1 is as in ([\ref=R1]). Evidently, these conditions are satisfied with ε1,R. Therefore for every 0  ≤  k  <   log 2R,

[formula]

Using the fact that R  ≥  R1  ≥  R0, where R0 is as in ([\ref=R0]), we get

[formula]

The conditions ([\ref=epsilonR3]), ([\ref=epsilonR4]) arise naturally in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm4]. To prove it, we cite 4 propositions from [\cite=Badziahin]. We only add a notation for convenience and state the propositions using the new notation. For the proofs see [\cite=Badziahin]. For [formula], J  ⊆  Θ, denote

[formula]

and for any [formula] denote

[formula]

By putting the sign ·   at any coordinate (except for the first) we mean indifference with respect to that coordinate. For example,

[formula]

[formula]

Let [formula], J be an interval of length [formula]. Then there exists a rational point P such that [formula].

Let [formula], J  ⊆  Θ, [formula], L1,L2∈C(n,  ·  ,k,J,P), L1  ≠  L2. Set τ  =  |J|Rn. Then there exists 0 < δ < 1 such that

[formula]

Under the notations of Proposition [\ref=5.2], one of the lines satisfies

[formula]

where

[formula]

Moreover, if for some [formula], [formula] then one of the lines L1,L2 satisfies

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let [formula], 0  ≤  k  <   log 2R, [formula], and

[formula]

Then there exists a line [formula] that passes through P and satisfies [formula], such that for every subinterval G  ⊆  Θ of length |G| = τR- n, one of the following holds:

[formula].

Every [formula] satisfies Δ(L)  ⊆  2Δ(L0) besides possibly 1 exceptional line.

δ from Proposition [\ref=5.2] satisfies

[formula]

where

[formula]

Set [formula] and [formula]. We wish to show that lines from [formula] remove at most Rβ  -  ε intervals I∈In + 1(J).

[formula]

so for any I∈In + 1(J)

[formula]

Then

[formula]

is an upper bound on the number of intervals that can be removed by a line [formula], and it satisfies

[formula]

where

[formula]

Set [formula]. Then [formula] so

[formula]

where

[formula]

Note that in both cases

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=thm3], there exists a rational point P such that [formula]. Using the one-dimensionality of J, there exists a covering {Gi}d*i = 1 of [formula] by intervals of length [formula] centered in [formula], such that every [formula] is contained in at most two Gi's. Since [formula] and μ satisfies a power law, d* must satisfy

[formula]

Consider [formula]. Note that |Gi|  ≤  τR- n, and that by definition of K*, for each line L, Δ(L) intersects at most K* intervals from In + 1(J). Therefore, if for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  d * , [formula] consists of only 1 line then by ([\ref=K1]), they all remove at most

[formula]

We shall show that either we have to deal with only one more line, or otherwise we will have a useful bound on the number of lines in [formula]. Case 1, [formula]. Viewing Proposition [\ref=5.4], for each [formula] there are at most two relevant lines, one exceptional line in each [formula] and one line L0 with [formula] which is the same for every i with [formula]. If [formula] for some n0 < n, then intervals that intersect [formula] were obviously removed during the [formula]'th step. Moreover, if there were some [formula] such that [formula] then [formula] and by ([\ref=tmp]), [formula], but then J1 was already removed in the [formula]'th step. Thus [formula] cannot remove any interval from Jn0 + 2, and since n0 < n, neither from Jn + 1. If L0∈C(n) then by the same calculation as in ([\ref=dlRemove]), [formula] may remove at most

[formula]

intervals. Finally, in this case where [formula], using ([\ref=dK]) we get that there are at most

[formula]

subintervals I∈In + 1(J) to be removed. Using ([\ref=epsilonR3]) we get the estimation we wanted. Case 2, [formula]. Denote the number of lines in [formula] by M. By Proposition [\ref=F],

[formula]

satisfies M  ≤  M* + 1. No two points [formula] are on the same line through the origin, because if they were then the lines [formula] and [formula] would be parallel, contradicting that they intersect in P. It follows that these points create disjoint triangles with the origin (0,0). Each triangle has area at least [formula], and the area of the union of triangles can't exceed the area of [formula]. By Definition ([\ref=c2]) of c2, [formula], so by ([\ref=FEq])

[formula]

For [formula], [formula], by ([\ref=FlEq]) and ([\ref=c3]),

[formula]

To ease calculations, use ([\ref=ij]) and ([\ref=lambda]) to write

[formula]

Thus for any [formula]

[formula]

We will show that MK*  ≤  Rβ  -  ε, and we are done with the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm4]. Using ([\ref=delta]) we have

[formula]

By ([\ref=tau])

[formula]

Case 2.1, [formula]. By ([\ref=M]), ([\ref=deltai]), ([\ref=cRtau]) and ([\ref=c4])

[formula]

Using ([\ref=K]) and 2- k < 1,

[formula]

Combine ([\ref=Mlast]), ([\ref=Klast]) and ([\ref=c5]) to get,

[formula]

By ([\ref=epsilonR4]),

[formula]

Case 2.2, [formula]. By ([\ref=M]), ([\ref=deltai]), ([\ref=cRtau]) and ([\ref=c4])

[formula]

and by ([\ref=K])

[formula]

Combine ([\ref=Mlast2]), ([\ref=Klast2]) and ([\ref=c5]) to get,

[formula]

Note that because of ([\ref=alpha]), [formula] so we are done.

Measure On The Limit Set Of A Tree-Like Family

We remark that [formula]. Assume first that n0 = 0, T0  =  {J0}, |J0| = 1. For every [formula] define νn by distributing it equally on each element of Tn, i.e.,

[formula]

where L|I is the restriction of the Lebesgue measure to the interval I, i.e., for any [formula], [formula]. νn is a probability measure because of ([\ref=numOfChildren]). Thus, there is a weak-* convergent subsequence [formula]. Denote its limit by ν. Then,

[formula]

We have [formula] so actually

[formula]

Also, for every [formula], I∈Tn and every m  ≥  n, [formula] and thus

[formula]

Let B(x,r) be any ball of radius r and center x∈supp(ν), and let n be such that

[formula]

For the left hand inequality in Definition ([\ref=powerLawEq]), x∈supp(ν) so by ([\ref=treeBigcap]) there exists I∈Tn + 1 such that x∈I, therefore I  ⊆  B(x,r), so by ([\ref=treeMeas])

[formula]

For the right hand inequality in Definition ([\ref=powerLawEq]),

[formula]

so ν(B(x,r))  ≤  3Rβrβ. Finally ν satisfies the definition of power law ([\ref=powerLawEq]) with [formula] and b2  =  3Rβ. In the general case where [formula], we start the construction from n  ≥  n0, and again define νn by distributing equally the Lebesgue measure of each element in Tn0

[formula]

where a(I) = |J| for the unique J∈Tn0 such that I  ⊆  J, and

[formula]

Define ν as above. ([\ref=treeBigcap]) is satisfied, and instead of ([\ref=treeMeas]) we have

[formula]

Let B(x,r) be any ball of radius r and center x∈supp(ν), and let n be such that

[formula]

On one hand, x∈supp(ν) so by ([\ref=treeBigcap]) there exists J∈Tn + 1 such that x∈J, therefore J  ⊆  B(x,r), so by ([\ref=treeMeasGen])

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

so [formula]. Finally ν satisfies the definition of power law ([\ref=powerLawEq]) with [formula] and [formula].

[formula] Is Absolutely Winning On [formula] (joint with Barak Weiss)

The work described in the body of this paper was done prior to the appearance of Jinpeng An's work [\cite=JinpengAn] on Arxiv. In this appendix we explain how An's work can be used to obtain a strengthening of the results of this paper. In particular, we prove a result about the Hausdorff dimension.

Let [formula] be the support of a measure satisfying a power law, and let [formula] with [formula] as in ([\ref=ij]). Then

[formula]

To prove Theorem [\ref=iOurThm], we use the notion of an absolute winning set, as defined by McMullen in [\cite=Mc] and generalized to the notion of a hyperplane absolute winning (HAW) in [\cite=BFKRW]. Let [formula] and let β > 0. The β-absolute game is defined as follows. Bob starts by choosing a closed ball [formula] with x0∈X and r0 > 0. The game continues in the n'th step, [formula], with Alice choosing a βn-neighborhood An of a point in [formula], where βn  ≤  βrn - 1, and Bob choosing a closed ball

[formula]

with xn∈X and rn  ≥  βrn - 1. A set S  ⊆  X is β-absolute winning on X if Alice can force [formula]. One advantage of the absolute winning property is that it passes to certain subsets:

(cf. [\cite=BFKRW], Definition 4.2) A closed set [formula] is said to be β-diffuse, 0  <  β  <  1, if there exists ρK > 0 such that for any 0  <  ρ  <  ρK, x∈K and [formula]

[formula]

We say that K is diffuse if it is β-diffuse for some 0  <  β  <  1.

For diffuse sets we define

[formula]

It is clear that [formula]. Also, if β  >  β0(K), it is possible that Bob will not have an available move to make, and our game is ill-defined. We will consider the absolute game played on a diffuse set K, where Bob first chooses a 0 < β  <  β0(K) and the game continues as a β-absolute game on K, and say that S is absolute winning on K if it is β-absolute winning on K for every 0 < β  <  β0(K). It is easy to see that this is equivalent to requiring that for any ε > 0 there is 0 < β  <   min {ε,β0(K)} such that S is β-absolute winning on K.

Assume [formula] is absolute winning on [formula] and let [formula] be diffuse. Then [formula] is absolute winning on K.

As an example of a diffuse set one can take the support of a measure satisfying a power law. Two additional advantages of using games, and in particular the absolute game, are the infinite intersection and the full Hausdorff dimension properties.

For every [formula], assume Sn  ⊆  R is absolute winning on [formula]. Then [formula] is absolute winning on [formula].

To get the full Hausdorff dimension of the intersection with nice fractals, we note that being absolute winning implies being winning in the original sense due to Schmidt [\cite=S]. Specifically:

Let [formula] be diffuse and assume S  ⊆  K is absolute winning on K. Then S is winning on K.

Assume [formula] is the support of a measure satisfying a power law, and S  ⊆  K is winning on K. Then, dim(S)=dim(K).

We will need a variant of the absolute game.

Fix an integer [formula] and change only the following: in every step n  ≥  1 allow An to be the union of up to N neighborhoods of points in [formula] of radius not bigger than βrn - 1. Call this game (N,β)-absolute game. A set S  ⊆  K which is winning for this game played on K will be called (N,β)-absolute winning on K.

A closed set [formula] is said to be (N,β)-diffuse, 0  <  β  <  1, if there exists ρK > 0 such that for any 0  <  ρ  <  ρK, x∈K and x1,...,xN∈R

[formula]

We say that K is N-diffuse if it is (N,β)-diffuse for some 0  <  β  <  1 (since [formula] and β < 1 there is no ambiguity in this notation).

For N-diffuse sets we define

[formula]

As before, we will consider the N-absolute game played on a N-diffuse set K, where Bob first chooses a 0 < β  <  β0(K,N) and the game continues as a (N,β)-absolute game, and say that S is N-absolute winning on K if it is (N,β)-absolute winning on K for every 0 < β  <  β0(K,N). It is left to the reader to see that

If [formula] is diffuse then for every [formula], K is N-diffuse.

A set S  ⊆  X is N-absolute winning on X if and only if S is absolute winning on X.

Note that in Definition [\ref=multipleDefn], Alice may also use less than N neighborhoods. So a set which is absolute winning on X is obviously N-absolute winning on X. Assume S is N-absolute winning on X and define a strategy for Alice. Let 0  <  β  <  β0. Then 0  <  βN  <  β0, so there is a winning strategy for Alice in the βN N-absolute game. Let Bn be the n'th ball Bob chose in the β-absolute game. Then, {BnN}∞n = 0 is a legitimate sequence of balls in the βN N-absolute game. Let [formula] be the n'th choice of Alice using her winning strategy. Then, for every [formula] write n = qN + r with 1  ≤  r  ≤  N and [formula], and let Alice choose An = Aq(r). We have,

[formula]

So S is winning for the β-absolute game on X.

Now we're going to use this Lemma in order to show that the arguments of [\cite=JinpengAn] imply that [formula] is not only winning but is absolute winning.

For any R > 8, a closed interval B  ⊆  Θ and a ⌊R⌋-regular tree-like family [formula] such that T0  =  {B} and for every I∈Tn, |I| = |B|R- n, there exists a (⌊R⌋ - 5)-regular tree-like subfamily I such that

[formula]

[formula] is absolute winning on [formula].

Let Bob choose the ball [formula], and [formula]. Define [formula]. Let T be the tree-like family of closed intervals that is generated by the recursive procedure of taking ⌊R⌋ subintervals of length [formula] from the previous level, starting from the left side of each interval. Since [formula], R > 8 and by Proposition [\ref=jinpengLemma] there exists a ⌊R⌋ - 5 regular subtree I. We use it to define a winning strategy for Alice for the N-absolute game with N = 12. On her first turn, Alice chooses

[formula]

which is a union of at most 6 intervals. Note that by the definition of I,

[formula]

In the following moves of Alice plays dummy moves by choosing the empty set, except for the turns sn in which Bob chooses for the first time a ball of radius r that satisfies

[formula]

(If this doesn't happen, Alice continues playing dummy moves and wins because [formula] is dense). Assume that Alice chose Asn - 1 such that [formula]. This is true for n = 1 by ([\ref=base1]), where s0 is defined to be 1. By the RHS of ([\ref=rjn]) there exist I1,I2∈Tn such that [formula]. By the induction hypothesis I1,  I2 are actually in In  ⊆  Tn. By the construction of I, both I1,I2 contain at most 5 intervals that are not in In + 1. Taking into account also the rightmost subinterval of each of them, Alice chooses Asn + 1 to be a union of at most 12 intervals. Note that by the LHS of ([\ref=rjn]) any I∈In + 1 satisfies

[formula]

so Alice can indeed do it by the rules of our game. We still have to show that by doing so Alice does not lose the game by leaving Bob with no possible continuation. For that we show that there is a ball B of radius [formula] such that [formula]. It is sufficient to show that [formula], where Ãsn is a [formula]-neighborhood of Asn. Indeed, for n = 1 there is nothing to prove since R > 8 and Alice removed at most 6 subintervals. For n > 1 use ([\ref=rjn]) to get

[formula]

In case [formula] we are done. If [formula] we can set [formula] using the same reasoning with β3. Since [formula] we will be done. This defines a winning strategy for Alice in the absolute game with N = 12, because

[formula]

Therefore applying Lemma [\ref=multiple] we have proved that [formula] is absolute winning on [formula].

For every [formula], [formula] is absolute winning on [formula]. By using the infinite intersection property of absolute winning sets Proposition [\ref=infiniteIntersection] we get that [formula] is absolute winning on [formula]. Therefore by Proposition [\ref=abs], [formula] is absolute winning on [formula]. At last, by Proposition [\ref=absSchmidt], [formula] is winning on [formula] and hence by the full dimension property Proposition [\ref=fullDimension] and the fact that [formula] is the support of a measure satisfying a power law, we get

[formula]
