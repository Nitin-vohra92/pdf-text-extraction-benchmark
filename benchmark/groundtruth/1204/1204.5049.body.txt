A General Double Inequality Related to Operator Means and Positive Linear Maps

Introduction

In what follows, [formula] denotes the C*-algebra of all bounded linear operators acting on a Hilbert space [formula] and I stands for the identity operator. A selfadjoint operator [formula] is said to be positive (strictly positive, resp.) if 〈Aξ,ξ〉  ≥  0 (〈Aξ,ξ〉 > 0,ξ  ≠  0, resp.) for all [formula] and we write A  ≥  0  (A > 0, resp.). For selfadjoint operators [formula], by A  ≥  B  (A > B, resp.) we mean A - B  ≥  0   (A - B > 0, resp.). A linear map [formula] between C*-algebras is called positive (strictly positive, resp.) if it maps positive (strictly positive, resp.) operators into positive (strictly positive, resp.) operators and is said to be unital if it maps identity operator to identity operator in the corresponding C*-algebra.

By an operator monotone function, we mean a continuous real-valued function f defined on an interval J such that A  ≥  B implies f(A)  ≥  f(B) for all self adjoint operators A,B with spectra in J. Some structure theorems on operator monotone functions can be found in [\cite=FHPS].

The axiomatic theory for operator means for pairs of positive operators have been developed by Kubo and Ando [\cite=KA]. A binary operation σ defined on the set of strictly positive operators is called an operator mean provided that

IσI = I;

C*(AσB)C  ≤  (C*AC)σ(C*BC);

[formula] and [formula] imply [formula], where [formula] means that [formula] and An  →  A as n  →    ∞   in the strong operator topology;

A  ≤  B and C  ≤  D imply that AσC  ≤  BσD .

There exists an affine order isomorphism between the class of operator means and the class of positive operator monotone functions f defined on (0,  ∞  ) with f(1) = 1 via f(t)I = Iσ(tI)    (t > 0). In addition, AσB  =  A1 / 2f(A- 1 / 2BA- 1 / 2)A1 / 2 for all strictly positive operators A,B. The operator monotone function f is called the representing function of σ. Using a limit argument by Aε = A + εI, one can extend the definition of AσB to positive operators as well. The operator means corresponding to operator monotone functions (1 - α) + αt and tα with 0  ≤  α  ≤  1 are called weighted arithmetic and weighted geometric means and are denoted by [formula] and #  α, respectively. In particular [formula] and #  1 / 2 or simply written as [formula] and #   are called arithmetic and geometric mean, respectively.

In this paper we establish a general double inequality involving operator means and positive linear maps, which unifies and includes the recent results of [\cite=MNS] [\cite=S] concerning Diaz-Metcalf and reverse Ando type inequalities. We also give some related inequalities involving Hadamard product and operator means.

Main Result

We start this section with our main result. It extends the reverse Ando's inequality presented in [\cite=S] and some Diaz-Metcalf type inequalities in [\cite=MNS] as we see in the sequel.

Let [formula] be such that 0 < b1I  ≤  A  ≤  a1I and 0 < b2I  ≤  B  ≤  a2I for some scalars 0 < bi  <  ai,    i = 1,2 and [formula] be a positive linear map. Then for any operator mean σ with the representing function f, the following double inequality holds:

[formula]

where [formula] [formula] [formula] and α∈(0,1).

The conditions 0 < b1I  ≤  A  ≤  a1I and 0 < b2I  ≤  B  ≤  a2I implies that 0 < b2a- 11A  ≤  b2I  ≤  B  ≤  a2I  ≤  a2b- 11A. Consequently, 0 < b2a- 11 < a2b- 11. The function f:(0,  ∞  )  →  (0,  ∞  ) being operator monotone is strictly increasing and concave [\cite=FHPS]. Therefore x- 1f(x) is operator monotone decreasing (see [\cite=FHPS]). This implies that μ and ν are positive. In fact,

[formula]

and

[formula]

The first inequality in [\eqref=(1)] follows on using the weighted arithmetic-geometric mean inequality [formula].

For the second inequality in [\eqref=(1)], consider μt + ν. Note that f(t) and the line μt + ν intersect at the points (a2b- 11,f(a2b- 11)) and (b2a- 11,f(b2a- 11)). Thus, since f(t) is concave [\cite=FHPS], we see that

[formula]

for all t∈[b2a -  11,a2b -  11]. So,

[formula]

for all α∈(0,1). Hence, since b2a- 11I  ≤  A- 1 / 2BA- 1 / 2  ≤  a2b- 11I, we obtain

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

Since Φ is positive and linear, [\eqref=(3)] yields

[formula]

The condition 0 < bi  <  ai,    i = 1,2 in Theorem [\ref=main] can be replaced by either 0 < b1  <  a1  and  0 < b2  ≤  a2 or 0 < b1  ≤  a1  and  0 < b2  <  a2.

Applications

Now we present several applications of our main Theorem [\ref=main].

Diaz-Metcalf type inequalities

Taking α = 1 / 2 and σ  =    #  , so that [formula] in the second inequality of [\eqref=main], we get the following Diaz-Metcalf type inequality of the second type:

[\cite=MNS] Let [formula] be positive invertible operators such that m21I  ≤  A  ≤  M21I and m22I  ≤  B  ≤  M22I for some positive real numbers m1 < M1 and m2 < M2 and [formula] be a positive linear map. Then

[formula]

If m2A  ≤  B  ≤  M2A for some positive real numbers m < M, then by considering Ψ(C) = Φ(A1 / 2CA1 / 2) and noting that m2I  ≤  A- 1 / 2BA- 1 / 2  ≤  M2I and 1I  ≤  I  ≤  1I we obtain the following inequality:

[formula]

Therefore we reach to the following Diaz-Metcalf type inequality of the first type:

[\cite=MNS] Let [formula] be positive invertible operators such that m2A  ≤  B  ≤  M2A for some positive real numbers m < M and [formula] be a positive linear map. Then

[formula]

Inequalities complementary to Ando's inequality

Ando's inequality [\cite=A] states that if [formula] are positive operators, α∈[0,1] and Φ is a positive linear map, then

[formula]

The following result is an additive reverse of the second type of this inequality:

Let A,B, Φ and μ,ν and α be as in Theorem [\ref=main]. Then

[formula]

In particular, when α = 1 / 2.

[formula]

whenever Φ(I)  ≤  I.

From inequality [\eqref=(2)] we get

[formula]

As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=main] the above inequality yields

[formula]

Now on using weighted arithmetic-geometric mean inequality on the left hand side of the above inequality we get

[formula]

Taking σ  =    #  α and using the given conditions on A,B we get the desired inequality [\eqref=g2]. Inequality [\eqref=com2] immediately follows from [\eqref=g2] for α = 1 / 2 because both Φ(A)  #  Φ(B) and Φ(A  #  B) are symmetric with respect to A and B.

Using the technique in Subsection [\ref=msm] we can get the following reverse Ando inequality of the second type:

[\cite=S] Let [formula] be positive invertible operators such that mA  ≤  B  ≤  MA for some positive real numbers m < M and [formula] be a positive linear map. Then for α∈(0,1),

[formula]

Shisha-Mond and Kalmkin-McLenaghan inequalities

Now, we present a Kalmkin-McLenaghan type inequality due to Seo [\cite=S]:

Let A,B, Φ and μ,ω be as in Theorem [\ref=main]. Then

[formula]

Now from [\eqref=(1)] for α = 1 / 2 we get

[formula]

whence

[formula]

which is a generalized operator Shisha-Mond inequality.

If σ is taken to be #  , we get the following Operator Shisha-Mond inequality:

[\cite=MNS] Let [formula] be positive invertible operators such that m2A  ≤  B  ≤  M2A for some positive real numbers m < M and [formula] be a positive linear map. Then

[formula]

Using the technique in Subsection [\ref=msm] we can get the following Kalmkin-McLenaghan inequality:

[\cite=MNS] Let [formula] be positive invertible operators such that m21I  ≤  A  ≤  M21I and m22I  ≤  B  ≤  M22I for some positive real numbers m1 < M1 and m2 < M2 and [formula] be a positive linear map. Then

[formula]

Ozeki-Izumino-Mori-Seo type inequalities

Now we present a generalized operator Ozeki-Izumino-Mori-Seo type inequality. To achieve it, we need the following lemma, which is helpful in proving many operator inequalities.

Let Φ be a unital positive linear map on [formula] [formula] is selfadjoint with bI  ≤  A  ≤  aI. Then

[formula]

The proof is an easy consequence of both facts

[formula]

and

[formula]

Suppose that [formula] is a strictly positive linear map with Φ(I)  ≤  I. Assume that [formula] are such that 0 < b1I  ≤  A  ≤  a1I and 0 < b2I  ≤  B  ≤  a2I. Then

[formula]

Consider the strictly positive linear map [formula] defined by

[formula]

Clearly Ψ(I) = I. Utilizing Lemma [\ref=l1], we obtain

[formula]

for all C with 0 < bI  ≤  C  ≤  aI. Put C: = f(A- 1 / 2BA- 1 / 2). The given conditions on A,B imply that

[formula]

The operator monotonicity of f then yields

[formula]

Thus inequality [\eqref=(7)] gives rise to

[formula]

Now on pre and post multiplying by Φ(A), we obtain

[formula]

Let [formula] be such that 0 < b1I  ≤  A  ≤  a1I and 0 < b2I  ≤  B  ≤  a2I, respectively. Then for any unit vector [formula],

[formula]

The corollary follows on considering the unital positive linear map Φ on [formula] given by Φ(C) =  ~  < Cx,x > .

[\cite=IMS] Let [formula] be such that 0 < b1I  ≤  A  ≤  a1I and 0 < b2I  ≤  B  ≤  a2I, respectively. Then for any unit vector [formula],

[formula]

Replacing σ by #   in Corollary [\ref=c1], we get the desired result.

Greub-Rheinboldt type inequality

Greub-Rheinboldt [\cite=GR] showed that if [formula] be such that and 0 < mI  ≤  A  ≤  MI, then

[formula]

The first consequence of our main result is a generalized Greub-Rheinboldt inequality.

If [formula] be such that 0 < mI  ≤  A  ≤  MI, then for any 0 < α < 1, any operator mean σ and any positive linear map Φ the following Greub-Rheinboldt type inequality is valid:

[formula]

where μ and ω are determined as in Theorem [\ref=main] with a1 = M,b1 = m,a2 = m- 1 and b2 = M- 1.

Using [\eqref=(1)] with B = A- 1 we get the desired inequality.

Inequalities involving Hadamard product and operator means

In this section we present several inequalities involving Hadamard product and operator means.

If U is the isometry of H into [formula] given by [formula], where {en} is a fixed orthonormal basis of H, then the Hadamard product [formula] of (bounded) operators A and B on H for {en} is expressed by

[formula]

A real valued continuous function f is called supermultiplicative (submultiplicative, resp.) if f(xy)  ≥  f(x)f(y) (f(xy)  ≤  f(x)f(y), resp.).

Let [formula] be such that b1I  ≤  A  ≤  a1I, b2I  ≤  B  ≤  a2I, b3I  ≤  C  ≤  a3I and b4I  ≤  D  ≤  a4I for some scalars [formula] Then for any operator mean σ, whose representing function f is submultiplicative, the following generalized inequalities hold for α∈(0,1):

[formula].

[formula].

[formula]. In particular,

[formula]

[formula]. In particular, [formula].

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]

We have

[formula]

Taking X = A- 1 / 2CA- 1 / 2 and Y = B- 1 / 2DB- 1 / 2, we obtain

[formula]

Also, simple arguments leads to [formula] so on replacing A by [formula] and B by [formula] in Theorem [\ref=main] and taking Φ(Y) = U*YU, where U an isometry satisfying [formula], and using [\eqref=(8)] we get (i) and (ii). The rest of the inequalities can be proved similarly.

Let A,B,C,D,σ and f as in Theorem 4.1.Then, the following generalized inequalities hold:

[formula],

[formula]

where [formula] [formula], [formula] and g(t) = μt + ν - f(t) for c and t0 some fixed points in (a- 11a- 12b3b4,a3a4b- 11b- 12).

It is known [\cite=KSA] that if A,B > 0 be such that aA  ≥  B  ≥  bA for some scalars a  ≥  b > 0 and Φ is a positive linear map, then for any connection σ,

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] for some fixed c∈(b,a) and g(t) = μt + ν - f(t), t0 a fixed point in (b,a) with - g(t0)  ≥  0, [formula] and f(t) is the representing function of σ.

As in Theorem 4.1, replacing A by [formula] and B by [formula] in [\eqref=R1] and [\eqref=R2] and using inequality [\eqref=(8)], we get

[formula]

and

[formula]

Once again (i) and (ii) can be deduced by considering Φ(Y) = U*YU, where U an isometry satisfying [formula].
