Characterization theorem on losses in GIX / GIY / 1 / n queues

Introduction

There are several papers that study the properties of losses from queues during their busy periods. In [\cite=Abramov_1997] and then in [\cite=Righter_1999] and [\cite=Wolff_2002], it was proved that in M / GI / 1 / n queueing systems, in which the expectations of interarrival and service times are equal, the expected number of losses during their busy periods is equal to 1 for all n. In [\cite=Abramov_2001b], this result was extended for MX / GI / 1 / n queues. In [\cite=Abramov_2001a] and [\cite=Abramov_2006] some stochastic inequalities connecting the number of losses during busy periods in M / GI / 1 / n and GI / M / 1 / n queues and the number of offspring in Galton-Watson branching processes were obtained, and in [\cite=Wolff_2002], for GI / GI / 1 / n queueing systems in which interarrival time distribution belongs to the class NBUE or NWUE, simple inequalities for the expected number of losses during a busy period were obtained. Peköz, Righter and Xia [\cite=Pekoz_Righter_Xia_2003] gave a characterization of the number of losses during a busy period of GI / M / 1 / n queueing systems. They proved that if the expected number of losses during a busy period is equal to 1 for all n, then arrivals must be Poisson.

In the present paper, we prove a characterization theorem for the expected number of losses during a busy period for the class of GIX / GIY / 1 / n queueing systems, in which interarrival time distribution belongs to the class NWUE.

Recall that the probability distribution function of a random variable ξ is said to belong to the class NBUE if for any [formula] the inequality [formula] holds. If the opposite inequality holds, i.e. [formula], then the probability distribution function of a random variable ξ is said to belong to the class NWUE.

The queueing system GIX / GIY / 1 / n, where the symbols X and Y denote an arrival batch and, respectively, service batch, is characterized by parameter n and four (control) sequences {τi,Xi,χi,Yi} of random variables ([formula]), each of which consists of independently and identically distributed random variables, and these sequences are independent of each other (e.g. see [\cite=Borovkov_1976]). Let [formula] denote the interarrival time probability distribution function, [formula], and let [formula] denote the service time probability distribution function, [formula]. The random variables X1, X2, denote consecutive masses of arriving units or, in known terminology, their batch sizes; but here they are assumed to be positive real-valued random variables rather than integer-valued. In turn, the random variables Y1, Y2, denote consecutive service masses or service batches, which are also assumed to be positive real-valued random variables. The ith service batch Yi characterizes the quantity that can be processed during the ith service time given that the necessary quantity is available in the system immediately before the ith service. Both X1 and Y1 are assumed to have finite expectations. In addition, the capacity of the system n is assumed to be a positive real number in general.

The queueing systems with real-valued batch arrival and service, as well as with real-valued capacity are not traditional. They can be motivated, however, in industrial applications, where units can be lorries with sand or soil arriving in and departing from a storage station. In usual queueing formulations, where the random variables Xi and Yi are integer-valued, they are characterized as batches of arrived and served customers. The main result of the present paper, Theorem [\ref=thm3], is new even in the particular case when Xi = Yi = 1 and n is integer.

Let ML denote the total mass lost during a busy period. Assume that the probability distribution function A(x) belongs to the class NWUE. Then the equality [formula] holds for all positive real n if and only if arrivals are Poisson, the random variable Y1 takes a single value d, the probability distribution function of X1 is lattice with span d, and [formula].

This theorem is true for full and partial rejection policies, work-conserving disciplines and can be adapted to different models considered, for instance, in [\cite=Wolff_2002]. The characterization theorem is a necessary and sufficient condition that includes the case of the Poisson arrivals. However, if arrivals are not Poisson but belong to the practically important class NWUE, then in the case where [formula], i.e. in the case where the total mass of arrivals per unit time is not smaller than the total mass of service per unit time, we have the simple inequality given by Lemma [\ref=thm2] that is used to prove Theorem [\ref=thm3].

Proof of the main result

We start from the following lemma.

Assume that the length of a busy period has a finite mean, and that the probability distribution function A(x) belongs to the class NWUE. If [formula] and [formula], then for any nontrivial random variable Y1 (i.e. taking at least two positive values) we have [formula].

Let NA denote the total number of arrivals during a busy cycle (that is, total number of arrivals during a busy period plus the unit that starts the busy period), and let NS denote the total number of service completions during the busy period. Denoting by MA the total mass of arrivals during a busy cycle, and, respectively, by MS the total mass of served units during a busy period. Using Wald's identity, we have:

[formula]

where I in Equation [\eqref=eq2] denotes the length of idle time. Since A(x) belongs to the class NWUE, then [formula] (see [\cite=Wolff_book], p.482). Hence, from [\eqref=eq2] we have

[formula]

Note, that for MS we cannot use Wald's identity directly in order to show that [formula]. In order to prove this inequality, we introduce the sequence of random variables S1, S2, that characterizes real masses of service or, in other words, real batch sizes of service satisfying the properties [formula] while [formula] for i < j (1  ≤  i < j). Apparently S1, S2, are not independent random variables. So, additional properties of the sequence S1, S2, are needed in order to establish the inequality for [formula].

Let mi denote the workload of the system immediately before the service of the ith unit starts. Then, given {m1 = x1, [formula] (xi  ≤  n for all i), the sequence S1, S2, is conditionally independent. Hence, under the condition {m1 = x1, [formula] for the sequence of conditionally independent random variables S1, S2, one can use the following theorem by Kolmogorov and Prohorov [\cite=Kolmogorov_and_Prohorov].

(Kolmogorov and Prohorov [\cite=Kolmogorov_and_Prohorov].) Let ξ1, ξ2, be independent random variables, and let ν be an integer random variable such that the event {ν = k} is independent of ξk + 1, ξk + 2,. Assume that [formula], [formula] and the series [formula] converges. Then,

[formula]

Note, that the condition [formula] of Lemma [\ref=lem1] is satisfied, because [formula] and [formula] for all k. Hence, by the total expectation formula we have [formula], and consequently by Lemma [\ref=lem1] and the total expectation formula we arrive at [formula]. We show below, that in fact we have the strict inequality [formula].

Indeed, the fact that the probability distribution function A(x) belongs to the class NWUE implies that [formula] for any x. Hence, taking into account that Y1 takes at least two different positive values, one can conclude that there exists the value j0 such that [formula], and consequently [formula]. This implies

[formula]

Now [\eqref=eq1], [\eqref=eq3] and [\eqref=eq4] and the equality [formula] allows us to obtain the inequality [formula].

In the formulation of the Lemma [\ref=thm2] we assumed that the length of a busy period has a finite mean. This assumption is technically important in order to use Wald's identity. Note, that the assumption that the interarrival time distribution belongs to the class NWUE implies [formula] for any x, which consequently enables us to conclude that a busy period always exists (i.e. finite) with probability 1. If the expectation of the busy period length is infinite, then the expected number of losses during a busy period is infinite as well, and hence the statement of Lemma [\ref=thm2] in this case remains true.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm3]. Note first that if [formula], then [formula] vanishes as n  →    ∞   due to the law of large numbers. Hence, the only case [formula] is available, and this is the assumption in Lemma [\ref=thm2].

Hence, the problem reduces to a minimization problem for [formula] in the set of the possible values. More specifically, the problem is to find the infimum of [formula] subject to the constraints given by [\eqref=eq1], [\eqref=eq3], [\eqref=eq4] and the inequality [formula]. Then, the statement of this theorem follows if and only if along with [\eqref=eq1] we also have [formula], [formula] and [formula]. The first equality follows if and only if arrivals are Poisson, and the second one follows if and only if Y1 takes a single value d, and the probability distribution function of X1 is lattice with span d. Then, the system of three equations together with the equality [formula] (which in turn is a consequence of [formula]) yields the desired result [formula].
