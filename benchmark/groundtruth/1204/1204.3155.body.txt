Introduction

Fluid mechanics and infinite dimensional geometry already share a long and common history. In 1966, Arnold [\cite=Arnold] suggested to regard the space of velocity fields of an incompressible fluid as the Lie algebra of the infinite dimensional Lie group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms :

[formula]

Here M is the oriented manifold on which the fluid is living, μ is the volume form of M and (M) is the group of all smooth diffeomorphisms of M  . In this setting, Arnold interpreted the Euler equations of an incompressible fluid as a geodesic equation on μ(M) for an appropriate right-invariant metric.

It was not until the 70's that Arnold's vision of fluid mechanics could be made partially rigorous with the development of Banach and Hilbert manifolds. In [\cite=Ebin-Marsden], Ebin and Marsden considered volume preserving diffeomorphisms on a compact manifold M which are not smooth, but of Sobolev classes. In doing so, they obtained topological groups locally modelled on Hilbert spaces, and were able, following Arnold's ideas, to prove analytical results on the Euler equations. Their method is still an active research area (see for example [\cite=Gay-well] [\cite=Gay-Ratiu]).

On the geometrical side, volume preserving diffeomorphisms which are not smooth are problematic. For, the left-multiplication [formula] consumes derivatives of φ  , and thus, subgroups of the group of diffeomorphisms whose elements are not smooth cannot be turned into genuine infinite dimensional Lie groups (left multiplication is not smooth). Hence, from a Lie group theory point of view, one has to consider the group of smooth volume preserving diffeomorphisms of (M,μ)  , i.e., the group μ(M)  .

For technical reasons, μ(M) can only be given a Lie group structure modelled on topological vector spaces which are more general than Banach and Hilbert spaces, and an inverse function theorem, applicable beyond the usual Banach space category, is necessary. To our knowledge, only two authors succeeded in doing this. The first was Omori who showed and used an inverse function theorem in terms of ILB-spaces ("inverse limit of Banach spaces", see [\cite=Omori]), and later on, Hamilton with his category of tame Fréchet spaces together with the Nash-Moser inverse function Theorem (see [\cite=Hamilton]). Nowadays, it is nevertheless not uncommon to find mistakes or big gaps in the literature when it comes to the differentiable structure of μ(M)  , even in some specialized textbooks in infinite dimensional geometry. The case of M being non-compact is even worse, and no proof that μ(M) is a "Lie group" is available in this case.

A natural generalization of μ(M)  , with which we shall be concerned in this paper, is the space of volume preserving embeddings μ(M,N)  . This space is defined as follows. For a Riemannian manifold (N,g) and a compact, connected and oriented submanifold M of N  ,

[formula]

where (M,N) is the space of smooth embeddings from M into N  , and where μf (resp. μ) is the Riemannian volume form on f(M) (resp. M) induced by the ambient metric g (the orientation on f(M) being induced by f).

When M is an open subset of [formula] with boundary, then it is possible to extend Arnold's method by introducing a L2-metric on μ(M,N) and to show that the corresponding geodesics describe the dynamics of a liquid drop with free boundary. This has been discussed formally in [\cite=Lewis], and rigorous results in this direction can be obtained using spaces of volume preserving embeddings of Sobolev classes, as pointed out to us by Sergiy Vasylkevych.

In this paper, we focus on smooth volume preserving embeddings, i.e., on the space μ(M,N) as defined above. To this end, we adopt a rigorous infinite dimensional point of view based on Hamilton's category of tame Fréchet manifolds, and determine explicitly a natural class of Lagrangian equations on μ(M,N). We allow M to be of arbitrary dimension, and we assume that it has no boundary.

More precisely, using the techniques developed by Hamilton in [\cite=Hamilton], as well as a generalization of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition Theorem for vector fields supported on submanifolds (Proposition [\ref=decomposition_de_Hel-Hod]), we are able, in Theorem [\ref=Emn_variete_tame], to show the following result: the space μ(M,N)× of volume preserving embeddings whose mean curvature is nowhere vanishing forms a tame Fréchet submanifold of (M,N)  . This result is a consequence of the Nash-Moser inverse function Theorem.

Having a manifold structure on μ(M,N)×  , we then consider Lagrangian mechanics on it. The Lagrangians we consider are of the following form:

[formula]

where [formula] is a Lagrangian density and where Xf  :  M  →  TN is a "divergence free vector field along f", regarded as an element of Tfμ(M,N)×  . As it turns out, the resulting Euler-Lagrange equations are (pointwise) the usual finite dimensional Euler-Lagrange equations (written in a covariant form), twisted by a "Helmholtz-Hodge projection" (Proposition [\ref=theoreme_ultime???_lol]).

When L is the energy associated to the metric g  , then the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations on μ(M,N)× are geodesic equations which generalize the Euler equations of an incompressible fluid to the case of an "incompressible membrane" of arbitrary dimension moving in N (Proposition [\ref=je_derpime_pas_de_fric]).

It would be interesting to know if these equations have a physical meaning.

The paper is organized as follows. In §[\ref=subsection_the_category_of_hamitlon], we review very briefly Hamilton's category of tame Fréchet manifolds. In §[\ref=sss_madco_encore...], we show that μ(M,N)× is a tame Fréchet submanifold of (M,N)  ; this requires a generalization of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition. In §[\ref=sss_pas_inspireeee], we compute the Euler Lagrange equations on μ(M,N)× for a natural class of Lagrangians, and in §[\ref=eeeeffffgggfggrrrr], we identify the natural generalization of the Euler equations of an incompressible fluid.

The differentiable structure of the space of volume preserving embeddings

Let (N,g) be a Riemannian manifold and let M be a compact, connected and oriented submanifold of N  . We denote by [formula] the space of smooth embeddings from M into N  .

For an embedding [formula] we denote by μf the volume form on f(M) induced by the restriction of the metric g to the submanifold f(M) (the orientation on f(M) being induced by f). With this terminology, we define the space of volume preserving embeddings as

[formula]

where μ is the Riemannian volume form on M induced by the metric g  .

The aim of this section is to use the Nash-Moser inverse function Theorem (as formulated in [\cite=Hamilton]) to define a differentiable structure on the open subset

[formula]

where   Πf denotes the trace of the second fundamental form of f(M)  .

For the reader's convenience, let us recall that the second fundamental form Πf of the submanifold f(M) is defined, for x∈f(M) and for two vector fields X,Y on f(M)  , by

[formula]

where [formula] (resp. [formula]) is the Levi-Civita connection on N (resp. f(M)) induced by g (resp. g|f(M)), and where [formula] are vector fields on N extending X and Y  .

Let us also recall that the trace of the second fundamental form Πf is defined, for x∈f(M)  , by

[formula]

where k is the dimension of M and where {e1,...,ek} is an orthonormal basis for Txf(M)  . In particular,   Πf is a section of the normal bundle f of f(M)  , the latter bundle being, by definition, the vector bundle over f(M) whose fiber over x∈f(M) is

[formula]

Finally, recall that   Πf is, up to a multiplicative constant which depend on convention, the mean curvature of the submanifold f(M)  .

Hamilton's category of tame Fréchet manifolds

In this section, we review very briefly the category of tame Fréchet manifolds introduced by Hamilton in [\cite=Hamilton].

for all x∈F  .

for every (y,v1,...,vk)∈V  , where [formula] denotes the kth derivative of f  .

As one may notice, tame Fréchet spaces and smooth tame maps form a category, and it is thus natural to define a tame Fréchet manifold as a Hausdorff topological space with an atlas of coordinates charts taking their value in tame Fréchet spaces, such that the coordinate transition functions are all smooth tame maps (see [\cite=Hamilton]). The definition of a tame smooth map between tame Fréchet manifolds is then straightforward, and we thus obtain a subcategory of the category of Fréchet manifolds. In order to avoid confusion, let us also make precise our notion of submanifold. We will say that a subset M of a tame Fréchet manifold M  , endowed with the trace topology, is a submanifold, if for every point x∈M  , there exists a chart (U,φ) of M such that x∈U and such that [formula] where φ(U) = U  ×  V is a product of two open subsets of tame Fréchet spaces. Note that a submanifold of a tame Fréchet manifold is also a tame Fréchet manifold.

The differentiable structure of [formula]

Let Σ be an oriented submanifold of N endowed with the Riemannian volume form μΣ induced by g  .

We shall use the following terminology:

If Σ = f(M) for some embedding f∈(M,N)  , then we shall replace ``Σ" by ``f" in the above notation. For example, f instead of Σ  , etc.

Let Σ be a compact, connected, oriented submanifold of N whose mean curvature is not identically zero. Then, for every section X of TN|Σ  , there exist a unique Xμ∈Γμ(TN|Σ) and a unique function [formula] such that

[formula]

where [formula] is the Riemannian gradient of p taken with respect to g|Σ  .

Let X be an element of [formula] If X could be written X = Xμ  +  (p) + p  ·    ΠΣ with [formula] and [formula] then p would be a solution of the following partial differential equation :

[formula]

The differential operator [formula] acting on functions [formula] is an operator of the form [formula] where c is a smooth function, and, being an elliptic operator, it is well known that this operator is Fredholm, and that its analytical index is a topological invariant (see [\cite=Palais-seminar]). Hence, the index of [formula] equals the index of [formula] which is zero on the space [formula] Moreover, as c is nonnegative, and since Σ connected, we can use the maximum principle (see for example [\cite=Aubin] or [\cite=Jost-postmodern3]), to deduce that the kernel of [formula] is included in the space of constant functions, and as c is not identically zero in our case, this kernel has to be trivial. Hence, [formula] is bijective, and [\eqref=eq_HH] posses a unique solution [formula]

Now, if we take a function p solution to [\eqref=eq_HH] and set Xμ: = X - (p) - p  ·    ΠΣ  , then, it is straightforward to check that X = Xμ  +  (p) + p  ·    ΠΣ is the desired decomposition.

Proposition [\ref=decomposition_de_Hel-Hod] yields a topological decomposition

[formula]

where

[formula]

Moreover, by application of Stokes' Theorem, one easily sees that [\eqref=decomposition_H-H] is an orthogonal decomposition (whence the notation [formula]) with respect to the following weak scalar product :

[formula]

Let [formula] be the open subset of [formula] defined by

[formula]

The global version of Proposition [\ref=decomposition_de_Hel-Hod] is : In order to show Theorem [\ref=Emn_variete_tame], let us recall the construction of the "standard" chart (Uf,φf) of (M,N) centered at a point f∈(M,N)  . For this, we need

It is well known that (M,N) endowed with these charts is a tame Fréchet manifold (see for example [\cite=Hamilton] [\cite=Kriegl-Michor]), and it is clear, restricting the open sets Θf if necessary, that we also get an atlas for [formula]

We will also need the following map

[formula]

i.e., for [formula] ρ(f) is the unique function satisfying f*μf  =  ρ(f)  ·  μ on M  . Observe that ρ(f) > 0  .

Finally, for [formula] we define

Observe that fX  =  φ- 1f(X)∈Uf is volume preserving if and only if [formula]

Following Hamilton in [\cite=Hamilton], if we prove that Qf is a local diffeomorphism near the zero section, then it would be possible, using [formula] to define splitting charts for [formula] and thus to prove that [formula] is a tame submanifold of [formula] We will do this with two lemmas, the main point being the use of the inverse function theorem of Nash-Moser.

Let [formula] be a positively oriented chart for M and [formula] a chart for N such that fX(U)  ⊆  V for X sufficiently small.

For x∈U, a direct calculation shows that

[formula]

As (fX)*  x∂xi  =  *X*  x∂xi, we see that [\eqref=expression_locale_de_rho_en_coordonnées_locales] is a nonlinear differential operator of degree 1 in [formula], and it is well known that a nonlinear differential operator is a smooth tame map (see [\cite=Hamilton]).

Let us now compute its derivative in local coordinates. For this purpose, let us take a smooth curve of sections Xt in φf(Uf). We shall denote Yt: = ∂tXt, and ft: = fXt  =  φ- 1f(Xt) the corresponding smooth curve of embeddings in (M,N) (in the following, we may forget the subscript "t"). After elementary differential calculus, one finds,

[formula]

where A is the matrix whose entries are [formula] To carry out the calculation of ∂tA in local coordinates, we will also denote gNij: = g(∂yi,∂yj), Zt: = ∂tft∈Γ(f*tTN) and [formula] the Christofell symbols associated to the metric g on V  . Using Einstein summation convention and the formula ∂yαgNab  =  ΓkαagNkb  +  ΓkαbgNak, it is then easy to see that

[formula]

Since Zt  =  ∂tft  =  ∂tfXt  =  *  XtYt and ∂xifa  =  ∂xifaXt  =  *∂xiX can be considered respectively as a partial differential operator of order 0 (nonlinear) in X and (linear) in Y, and a nonlinear partial differential operator of order 1 in X, it follows easily, in view of [\eqref=expression_locale_avec_la_trace] and [\eqref=expression_locale_penible_de_la_derivées_des_composantes_de_la_matrice...], that (Pf)*  XY is a family of linear partial differential operators of degree 1 in Y with coefficients which are nonlinear partial differential operators of degree 1 in X.

Formula [\eqref=expression_de_la_derivée_de_Pf....] can be obtained after direct calculations, splitting Z into its tangential and normal parts [formula] [formula] and using, among others, equation [\eqref=expression_locale_penible_de_la_derivées_des_composantes_de_la_matrice...], ∂yαgNab  =  ΓkαagNkb  +  ΓkαbgNak as well as [formula] One finds

[formula]

One recognizes [\eqref=equation_de_la_divergence_en_local] as being [formula] and [\eqref=equation_avec_la_trace_de_la_seconde_forme_fondamentale_blablabla] to be the negative of [formula] Taking t = 0 and X0 = 0, then Z0  =  *  0Y = Y and formula [\eqref=expression_de_la_derivée_de_Pf....] follows.

From Lemma [\ref=expression_locale_de_rho], it follows that [formula] is a smooth tame map, and one may try to invert it on a neighborhood of the zero section.

The conditions required by the inverse function theorem of Nash-Moser are that (Qf)*  X is invertible for all X in a neighborhood of the zero section, and also that the family of inverses forms a smooth tame map (see [\cite=Hamilton]). So, let us take X∈φf(Uf), [formula] [formula] and [formula] Denoting [formula] we have :

[formula]

From the equivalence between equation [\eqref=equation_de_la_derivée_de_P_au_debut_de_la_ligne] and equation [\eqref=equation_du_systeme_avec_la_derivée_de_P], we see that (Qf)*  X is invertible if and only if the operator [formula] acting on p is invertible. Now, according to Lemma [\ref=expression_locale_de_rho], [formula] is a family of linear partial differential operators of degree 2 in p with coefficients which are nonlinear partial differential operators of degree 1 in X. Moreover, as

[formula]

is an elliptic operator in p with analytical index zero (see the proof of Proposition [\ref=decomposition_de_Hel-Hod]), it follows by the topological invariance of the analytical index that [formula] is a also elliptic in p with analytical index zero for X sufficiently small. This family is also a family of injective operators by the maximum principle (see [\cite=Aubin]). The maximum principle can be applied here, because [formula] is strictly negative (recall that we assume   Πf  ≠  0 for all x in M), and thus, the term of order zero [formula] will remain strictly negative for small X. It follows that this family is actually a family of invertible elliptic operators, and one can apply [\cite=Hamilton] to deduces that this family of inverses forms a smooth tame family of linear maps. The same conclusion being obviously true for the family of inverses ((Qf)*  X)- 1, the lemma follows.

The fact that μ(M,N)× is a submanifold of (M,N)× is now a simple consequence of Lemma [\ref=lemme_Q_est_un_diffeo_local] as we already remarked.

Mechanics on the space of volume preserving embeddings

Euler-Lagrange equations on μ(M,N)×

Let M be a compact, connected and oriented submanifold of a Riemannian manifold (N,g)  . We denote by μ the Riemannian volume form on M induced by the ambient metric g  .

In this section, we consider Lagrangian mechanics on μ(M,N)× for Lagrangians of the following type :

[formula]

where [formula] is a Lagrangian density and where [formula]

Observe that the last equality in [\eqref=eee_definition_lagr] comes from a change of variables together with the formula f*μf  =  μ  .

In order to formulate the Euler-Lagrange equations on μ(M,N)× associated to [formula], we have to introduce some terminology. Recall that the metric g induces a connector K  :  T(TN)  →  TN (see [\cite=Lang], chapter 10, page 284), and that for vx∈TxN  , there is an isomorphism

[formula]

where π  :  TN  →  N is the canonical projection. Hence, for ξ∈TvxTN  , we have the decomposition ξ  =  ξh  +  ξv which is characterized by Kξh = 0 and π*  vxξv = 0  . This decomposition defines a splitting of the bundle T(TN) into a direct sum [formula] where HN is the horizontal vector bundle and VN the vertical vector bundle (see [\cite=Lang]).

With this notation, for vx∈TxN  , we have :

[formula]

Thus, there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

for all ξh∈(HN)vx  . Similarly, there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

for all ξv∈(VN)vx  . In this way, we define two maps [formula] and [formula] which are smooth and fiber preserving. For practical calculations, let [formula] be the canonical isomorphism induced by the metric g and [formula] its inverse. For vx∈TxN  , it is not hard to see that :

If [formula] where V is a function on N  , then [formula] and [formula] for all vx∈TxN  .

Finally, let us introduce, for a given f∈(M,N)×, the following operator:

[formula]

(see Remark [\ref=remarque_sur_la_decomposition] [\ref=la_vraie_de_H-H] (iii) for the definition of [formula]

The Euler-Lagrange equations on μ(M,N)× associated to a Lagrangian density [formula] are :

[formula]

where f = ft is a smooth curve in μ(M,N)×  , and where [formula] is the Levi-Civita connection associated to g  .

Let ft be a smooth curve in [formula] and let s be a proper variation in [formula] of the curve ft, i.e. a variation with fixed ends (see [\cite=Abraham-Marsden]). We have :

[formula]

As [formula] the second term in [\eqref=equation_terme_avec_le_connecteur] can be rewritten

[formula]

The proposition follows from [\eqref=equation_terme_avec_le_connecteur], [\eqref=equation_qui_tue_sgsg3] and the fact that [\eqref=decomposition_H-H] is an orthogonal decomposition.

An alternative description of the Euler-Lagrange equations on μ(M,N)×  , which is straightforward and maybe more explicit than the one given in Proposition [\ref=theoreme_ultime???_lol], is as follows.

The Euler-Lagrange equations on μ(M,N)× associated to a Lagrangian density [formula] are :

[formula]

where f = ft is a smooth curve in μ(M,N)×  , [formula] is a time-dependant function, [formula] is the Riemannian gradient of [formula] taken with respect to the induced metric on f(M) and where [formula] is the Levi-Civita connection associated to g  .

Application: generalization of the Euler equations

By "Euler equations", we are referring to the equations of an incompressible fluid on an oriented Riemannian manifold (M,g) with Riemannian volume form μ  :

[formula]

where Xt is a time dependent vector field describing the velocity of the fluid, [formula] is the pressure of the fluid, [formula] is the Riemannian covariant derivative of Xt in direction Xt and where (pt) is the Riemannian gradient of pt  . The condition μ(Xt) = 0 guaranties that the fluid is incompressible.

It is known, since Arnold's paper [\cite=Arnold], that the above equations can be interpreted as geodesic equations on the Fréchet Lie group μ(M) for the right invariant L2-metric which is defined, at the identity diffeomorphism, as [formula] where [formula]. Observe that the latter space is identified with the Lie algebra of μ(M)  .

Briefly, the fact that the Euler equations [\eqref=euler_equation_au_macdo] are equivalent to the geodesic equations of μ(M) comes from the right-invariance of the metric 〈  ,  〉 together with the following general fact: geodesic equations on a Lie group for a right (or left) invariant metric are equivalent to an evolution equation on the Lie algebra called Euler equation, which, in the particular case μ(M) yields the Euler equations of an incompressible fluid; this is Arnold's remarkable observation (see [\cite=Arnold] [\cite=Arnold-Khesin] [\cite=Ebin-Marsden]).

For us, the important point is that the Euler equations [\eqref=euler_equation_au_macdo] are equivalent to the geodesic equations for the metric 〈  ,  〉  , and that this metric can be naturally generalized to μ(M,N)×  , as follows :

[formula]

where f∈μ(M,N)× and where [formula]

It is well known in the context of Riemannian geometry that geodesics are solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations associated to the energy, which in our case reads

[formula]

According to Proposition [\ref=proposition_yoyoyoyoy], and taking into account Example [\ref=esdnjfdsnfkd], we thus get

The geodesic equations on μ(M,N)× for the metric 〈  ,  〉 defined in [\eqref=definition_metric_sur_emb] are

[formula]

where f = ft is a smooth curve in μ(M,N)×  , and where [formula] is a time-dependant function.

In the special case M = N  , then μ(M,N) = μ(M) and the term   Πft in [\eqref=dsf_fsd_fddg] vanishes. Moreover, If f = ft is a smooth curve in (M) and if [formula] then one has the formula

[formula]

from which, together with [formula] one easily sees that [\eqref=dsf_fsd_fddg] reduces to the usual Euler equations of an incompressible fluid [\eqref=les_petites_equations]. Hence, [\eqref=dsf_fsd_fddg] is indeed a generalization of the Euler equations; we call it the Euler equations of an incompressible membrane.
