A class of generalized gamma functions

Introduction

Analogues of the gamma function Γ(s) have been proposed and studied by L.Bendersky [\cite=Bend33], E.L.Post[\cite=post19], S.Ramanujan [\cite=ramanu] and other authors such as F.H.Jackson which introduces a q-gamma function defined as an infinite product.

Euler's original definition of Γ(s) is

[formula]

and many representations of Γ(s) as integrals involving classical functions can be found in classical manuals (see [\cite=tables65] for example).

Our paper differs from previous approachs and study a modified gamma function discribed by formula [formula] closed to Euler's definition. However, no simple integral formula (involving classical functions distinct from Euler gamma function) has been obtained as an alternative description of the function Γa,r(s).

The paper is organized as follows: main properties of Γa,r(s) are summed in proposition [\ref=prop:main] and proofs of results of this section are concentrated in section [\ref=sec:proofs]. Section [\ref=sec:prelimi] states few properties of infinite products defined by formula [\ref=ff:gammaAdef].

Preliminaries

For a real sequence [formula] such that [formula] for all n, we formally put

[formula]

Clearly [formula].

Let [formula] be a subset of [formula]. For [formula] and [formula], we define

[formula] ; [formula] ; [formula]

We assume that [formula]. One has the following properties:

The function [formula] is defined and meromorphic on [formula] with poles only at s =  - an for [formula] and never vanishes on [formula].

For [formula] and [formula], one has:

[formula]

Assuming [formula] for all n, one has, for [formula]

[formula]

with [formula].

In this context, the strictly positive real number [formula] is well defined and one has, for [formula]:

[formula]

Choosing [formula], we get [formula] with γA equal to the Euler constant γ.

Proof: Putting [formula] for [formula], one has, for [formula]:

[formula]

The sequence of entire functions [formula] is uniformly convergent (as n  →    +    ∞  ) on compact sets of [formula] to the entire function [formula] which vanishes only at points s satisfying [formula], ie for [formula]. Clearly

[formula]

as n tends to +    ∞  , uniformly for s in a compact set of [formula]. Thus, formula [\ref=ff:gammaAdef] defines a meromorphic function on [formula] with poles only at s =  - ak for n  ≥  0, as a quotient of two entire functions. For formula [\ref=f:gamalph], omitting terms of the form [formula], it suffice to prove the equality for [formula] and formula holds for a general [formula] by analytic continuation. One has, for [formula]

[formula]

[formula]

For formula [\ref=f:gas2moinss], one has:

[formula]

[formula]

We note the

The functional equation satisfied by the Riemann zeta function is:

[formula]

This equality is the starting point of this work.

Proof: Since [formula], the functional equation takes the form

[formula]

hence, from [formula]

[formula]

Taking [formula] and [formula] in formula [\ref=f:gamalph] gives

[formula]

A direct substitution imply formula [\ref=f:zetafonct].

Properties of Γa,r functions

Let [formula] be an arithmetical sequence with reason r > 0 and first element a > 0 (or with reason r < 0 and first element a <  - 1). We define

[formula]

This formula is closed to Euler's definition [\ref=f:Eulerdef] of gamma function expressed as an infinite product. The Γa,r function is expressed by [\ref=f:gammaA] in a non-natural way in terms of the well-known Γ function in order to obtain shorter proofs of some properties of Γa,r functions. Some properties of Γa,r are more natural from explicit formula [\ref=f:defgammaA]. We note that [formula] and formula [\ref=f:zetafonct] becomes

[formula]

Following section [\ref=sec:prelimi], we put

Classical descriptions of sin (s) and cos (s) as infinite product are equivalent to

[formula]

with the following properties

[formula]

[formula]

due to [formula] and periodicity of cos (s). And sin(2πs) = 2  sin(πs)  cos(πs) expresses as

[formula]

which agree with formulas [\ref=sintwos] and [\ref=sinspr2] choosing a = 1 and r = 1.

Proofs

Proof of lemma [\ref=lem:cstes]: One has from [\cite=tables65] formula 8.364

[formula]

hence w = 1 gives formula [\ref=f:smallgammaA]. Choosing w =   ±  s gives formula [\ref=f:sinA]. For [formula]

[formula]

thus, by analytic continuation and proposition [\ref=prop:mero]

[formula]

Proof of proposition [\ref=prop:main]: Let [formula]. One has:

Clearly, as n  →    +    ∞

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

hence

[formula]

But

[formula]

thus

[formula]

and s = 0 gives

[formula]

showing [\ref=f:compl] for [formula], hence for [formula] by analytic continuation. We prove multiplication formula. Putting [formula] and using formula [\ref=f:gammaA], one has

[formula]

[formula]

From Gauss formula

[formula]

and

[formula]

we get that

[formula]

thus

[formula]

which agree with [\ref=f:ctesmultip]. Taking n = 2, we get formula [\ref=f:dupli].

Proof of proposition [\ref=propvarious]: We prove 1) of proposition [\ref=propvarious]. Formula [\ref=ggwithnr] follows from formula [\ref=f:defgammaA]. From formula [\ref=f:gammaA], one has

[formula]

Multiplying by [formula] or by [formula], one has:

[formula]

In the same way

[formula]

For 2), one has

[formula]

with

[formula]

With a similar method, we get formula [\ref=f:amoinsh]. For 2), let [formula] be the sequence {a + nr}n  ≥  0. From [\ref=f:gamalph] with α = r, we obtain

[formula]

From formula [\ref=f:gammaA]

[formula]

thus

[formula]

which is formula [\ref=f:newgamm].

Proof of proposition [\ref=propsin]:

One clearly has, for [formula], from formula [\ref=f:sinA]

[formula]

Taking [formula], we get formula [\ref=sinlambda]. For formula [\ref=sinsplr], one has

[formula]

hence

[formula]

From formula [\ref=f:sinA], we obtain

[formula]

thus

[formula]

proving so formula [\ref=sinspr2]. Formula [\ref=sinamoinsr2] follows directly from definition [\ref=defsinar]. Using formula [\ref=ggwithnr], we obtain

[formula]

Replacing s by ns and applying formula [\ref=sinlambda] with [formula], we obtain formula [\ref=sinwithnr].
