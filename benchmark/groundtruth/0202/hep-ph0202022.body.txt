Abstract We study a possibility to explain neutrino masses and mixings based on supersymmetry. If we introduce a flavor diagonal but generation dependent extra U(1) gauge interaction at a TeV region, we can obtain masses and mixings of neutrinos required for the explanation of both solar and atmospheric neutrinos. In this model, differently from the usual bilinear R-parity violating scenario, the neutrino mass degeneracy can be resolved at a tree level by the neutrino-gaugino mixing caused by an R-parity violation. The model is straightforwardly extended to include the quark sector by introducing an anomalous U(1) which can be used for the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism.

Introduction

Recent observations of the solar neutrinos [\cite=solar] and the atmospheric neutrinos [\cite=atmos] at Super Kamiokande suggest that neutrinos have small masses and there are large flavor mixings in the lepton sector. These features are quite different from the ones of the quark sector and it may be a clue to the developement of a unification picture of quarks and leptons for us to ask "what is the origin of these differences?".

The mixing in the lepton sector is represented by the so-called MNS matrix which is defined by [formula], where [formula] and Uν are the mixing matrices for charged leptons and neutrinos, respectively. Thus the origin of large mixings in the lepton sector exists in either [formula] or Uν. A famous example of possible mass matrices to realize large mixings is a democratic form, which takes the form such as

[formula]

However, this matrix has a serious problem to apply it to the neutrino sector. It has only a nonzero eigenvalue and then both the solar and atmospheric neutrino problems cannot be explained. It needs a suitable deviation from the exact democratic form to overcome this fault. It may be worthy to study how to generate an appropriately deviated form from it based on a certain physical principle. We study this problem on the basis of supersymmetry and an extra U(1) symmetry in a TeV region. The former one is related to the gauge hierarchy problem and the latter one often appears in the effective theory of superstring. So this kind of study is considered to be sufficiently motivated.

In the supersymmetric theory there generally exists a discrete symmetry called R-parity, which is defined by Rp = ( - 1)3B + L + 2S where B and L are a baryon number and a lepton number, respectively and S stands for a spin. Under this symmetry particles in the standard model (SM) have Rp =  + 1 and their superpartners have Rp =  - 1. Thus the SM particles cannot mix with their superpartners without an R-parity violation. In the minimal supersymmetric SM (MSSM) there are neutral fermions with Rp =  - 1 in addition to the neutrinos. They are called neutralinos and contain (λW3,λY,H̃01,H̃02). λW3 and λY are gauginos for SU(2)L  ×   U(1)Y gauge symmetry and H̃01 and H̃02 stand for Higgsinos. If Rp is not broken, neutrinos and neutralinos cannot mix. However, if there are Rp violations such as an explicit breaking due to the bilinear R-parity violating terms εαLαH2 in superpotential or a spontaneous breaking due to the nonzero vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of sneutrinos, mass mixings M among neutrinos and neutralinos appear in the form such as [\cite=rparity1] [\cite=rparity2]

[formula]

A study of the scalar potential indicates that 〈α〉 is proportional to εα. As a result of this feature, all column vectors of M are proportinal to each other. Under the assumption that gaugino masses M1,M2 and a supersymmetric Higgs mass μ are much larger than 〈α〉 and εα, we find that the neutrino mass matrix satisfies [formula] as a result of the seesaw mechanism [\cite=seesaw]. Unfortunately, the light neutrino mass matrix Mνij obtained in this way has only one nonzero mass eigenvalue. For the explanation of the atmospheric and solar neutrinos, we need a mass perturbation to resolve this mass degeneracy. A well-known example of such possibilities is an inclusion of one-loop effects and several works in this direction have been done by now [\cite=loop1] [\cite=loop2].

In this talk we would like to propose an another possibility. We consider a tree level solution to this problem and study whether we can obtain large flavor mixings and also appropriate mass eigenvalues in the lepton sector in such a scenario.

A simple Model

We introduce an extra U(1) gauge symmetry to the MSSM, which is assumed to remain unbroken at a TeV region. This kind of extra U(1) has several interesting aspects to take it seriously. In fact, such a kind of symmetry often appears in the effective theory of superstring and it can also present a natural solution to the μ-problem [\cite=mu]. So there is a certain physical motivation to consider such a symmetry in the model building. It should be noted that there are experimental constraints on the extra U(1) from the precision measurements at LEP. Its mass should be generally larger than 600GeV and its mixing angle ξ with the ordinary Z0 gauge boson has to be less than 10- 3.

In the present consideration we assume that the extra U(1) has flavor diagonal but generation dependent interactions such as

[formula]

If sneutrinos get nonzero vacuum expectation values [formula] in eq. ([\ref=eqb]), neutrino-gaugino mixing appears through [formula], which can break the previously mentioned proportional relation among column vectors of the extended neutrino-neutralino mixing matrix corresponding to ([\ref=eqa]). As a result, we can have two nonzero mass eigenvalues of neutrinos at the tree level [\cite=gaugino]. In the following discussion we study neutrino oscillation phenomena and other phenomenological features of this model.

We take charge assingments of this extra U(1) gauge symmetry for each generation of the leptons as follows,

[formula]

where [formula] and Rα stand for SU(2)L doublet fields and its singlet charged ones, respectively. We assume Higgs chiral superfields have no charge of the extra U(1). At this stage we do not identify the lepton flavor. If we assume that sneutrinos get VEVs such as [formula], we have a neutrino-gaugino mass matrix

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and [formula]. If elements of m are much smaller than the ones of M, we can use the seesaw formula and then the neutrino mass matrix is found to be written as

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and [formula]. A diagonalization matrix U of Mν which is defined by [formula] is easily found to be

[formula]

The mass eigenvalues and the mixing angle θ are written as

[formula]

If we assume that the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal, a transition probability for the neutrino oscillation να  →  νβ can be written by using the elements of the mixing matrix U as

[formula]

where Δm2ij  =  |m2i - m2j|. We summarize the contributions of the possible modes to the neutrino oscillation να  →  νβ in Table 1. Here we assume that an inverse hierarchy and also an approximate degeneracy between ν2 and ν3: m1  ≪  m2  ~  m3. In that case we find that the atmospheric neutrino requires

[formula]

The solar neutrino is also found to require that Δm223 should take a value in a solution dependent way in the region such as

[formula]

Taking account of this, we find that we should identify the flavor [formula] with (τ,μ,e). Then we can rewrite eq. ([\ref=eqc]) into the usual MNS mixing matrix as

[formula]

The atmospheric neutrino is explained by νμ  →  ντ which comes from the modes (A) and (B) in Table 1. On the other hand, the solar neutrino is explained by νe  →  νμ (E) and νe  →  ντ (D) whose total amplitude is A  =   sin 22θ. Thus if we assume sin 22θ  ~  10- 2, the small mixing MSW solution (SMA) is realized. The large mixing MSW solution (LMA) and others (LOW and VO) are possible for the case of sin 22θ  ~  1.

We order several aspects of other neutrino phenomenology in this model here. (1) CHOOZ constraint [\cite=chooz] : It is related to the neutrino oscillations νe  →  νμ,τ with Δm212 and Δm213 which are relevant to the atmospheric neutrinos. Their ampitudes are propotinal to UMNSe1 in this model. However, it is zero and then the CHOOZ constraint is trivially satisfied. (2) Neutrinoless double β-decay [\cite=beta] :  The effective mass parameter relevant to the neutrinoless double β decay can be estimated as

[formula]

where we assume φj = 0 and use the fact m2  ~  m3. Then we have |mee|  ~  0.04 - 0.08 eV independently of the value of sin θ. This value seems to be a promising one for near future experiments. (3) Effects of the mode (C) : This corresponds to the oscillation νμ  →  ντ, which is irrelevant to the atmospheric neutrino and also the short baseline experiments because of the smallness of Δm223. However, if sin 22θ≃1 and Δm223  ~  10- 4eV2 which correspond to the LMA solution are satisfied, it can effectively contribute to the deviation from the simple two flavor oscillation scenario at L ~  >  ~  ~ 2000 km.

Various issues of the model

In this section we will briefly comment on the issues which are crucial for the model to be a phenomenologically viable model.

(1) Realization of oscillation parameters We have MA,gA ~ (A = 2,1,X), qα and u as the parameters in our model. If we assume a gauge coupling unification and a universal gaugino mass M0 at MGUT, gaugino masses at a low energy region are determined by renormalization group equations as

[formula]

Under this assumption, the number of parameters can be effectively reduced and we can take [formula] and [formula] as the remaining parameters. Every oscillation parameter can be written down by using them. Taking account of this fact, we find that the atmospheric neutrinos require [formula]. This means that u should be 60 - 70 keV if we take M0  ~  100 TeV and gU  ~  0.72, for example. The solar neutrinos impose [formula] to be in a certain region, which is shown in Fig.1. From this figure we find that the LMA solution is allowed in the wider region than other solutions. Here it is a crucial problem whether the gauge symmetry including U(1)X can be anomaly free in a consistent way with the above required region of [formula]. On this point, we find that the model can be consistent, although we need to introduce additional chiral superfields such as [formula] and [formula] of SU(2)L  ×   U(1)Y, for example. If we impose the anomaly free conditions and also the massive conditions for the chiral superfields [formula] at the TeV region which seems to be required from experiments, qI and [formula] are found to satisfy a certain relation as shown in Fig.1. From this analysis we find that this kind of model can be easily constructed in a consistent way.

(2) [formula] nonuniversal coupling and FCNC We assume that U(1)X has the flavor diagonal but generation dependent interactions. In general, such kind of interactions can induce dangerous FCNC processes, for example, a coherent μ-e conversion, τ  →  3e,3μ, μ  →  eγ and so on. The additional new [formula] interactions can be written in mass eigenstates as [\cite=fcnc]

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] stand for the charged leptons. Vψ is a diagonalization matrix of the charged lepton mass matrix and it is defined as

[formula]

where mD is a Dirac mass matrix defined by [formula]. Because of the U(1)X constraint, we find that [formula]. So nonuniversal coupling of U(1)X induces no serious problem in this model. If the usual conditions [formula] GeV and ξ  ~   <  ~  ~ 10- 3 are satisfied, no contradiction to the present experimental data appears.

(3) Sneutrino VEVs Small but nonzero VEVs of sneutrinos 〈α〉 are crucial in this model. If bilinear R-parity violating terms εLαH2 exist in the superpotential, the minimization of the scalar potential results in

[formula]

where Bε is a soft breaking parameter for εLαH2 and 2 is an averaged value of the squared soft scalar masses of Higgs scalars. This implies that u can be very small for the small ε satisfying ε  ≪  μ,m,Bε. The problem is how we can explain the smallness of ε. Several possible solutions can be considered as in the case of μ-term [\cite=gm]. (i) Giudice-Masiero mechanism :  If Kähler potential includes a term ZLαH2 and the supersymmetry is broken by an F-term of the chiral superfield Z, for example, we have a small one such as [formula]. (ii) Higher dimensional term in the superpotential : We consider that the superpotential includes a nonrenormalizable term such as [formula]. If scalar components of N̄ and N get the VEVs of the intermediate scale through a D-flat direction and a scalar component of S gets a TeV scale VEV, for example, we can have [formula] which can be sufficiently small. (iii) Coupling to the superconformal sector : If the MSSM fields couple to the superconformal sector, they get large anomalous dimensions [\cite=ns]. This can be applied to the explanation of the hierarchy among Yukawa couplings and the universality of soft scalar masses [\cite=ns] [\cite=yukawa]. This idea is also applicable to the explanation of the smallness of ε. For example, we consider superpotentials Wsc = y1H̃1S + y2H̃2TS̄ and Wμ  =  εαLαH̃2  +  μ1H̃1H2  +  μ2H1H̃2, where T, ~  and S, ~ S̄ are chiral superfields in the superconformal sector and H̃1,2 are the extended Higgs chiral superfields. As a result of the couplings with the superconformal sector, H̃1,2 can have a large anomalous dimension γ and the bilinear R-parity violating parameters εα behave as [formula] [\cite=ks]. We find that there is a large suppression in the case of Λ  ≪  Λ0 even if ε(Λ0) is a weak scale. Anyway we have many candidates for the mechanism to realize the small bilinear R-parity violating terms and we can expect that they are applicable to our model.

An extension of the model

We consider here an extension of our simple model to include the quark sector. For this purpose we introduce two Abelian symmetries U(1)F  ×  U(1)X [\cite=origin]. Although U(1)X is assumed to be unbroken at a TeV region which is the same as in the previous simple model, we take U(1)F to be an anomalous U(1) symmetry which is broken near the Planck scale. It is used for the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism to generate the quark and lepton mass hierarchy. The field contents in this extended models are summarized as follows:

[formula]

where we use the SU(5) representation for the description of the quarks and the leptons. We introduce a pair of Higgs doublet chiral superfields only to guarantee the SM gauge couplings unification additionally to the above list of field contents. They have no affect to the following results. Here we impose several phenomenological conditions, that is, the gauge anomaly cancellation, the proton stability by prohibitting dangerous couplings of the extra colored triplets to the SM fields, and also the existence of Higgs mixings such as

[formula]

The last condition comes from the requirement to make only one pair of Higgs doublets massless. These requirements bring the constraints on the U(1)X charges introduced above. We must study neutrino masses under these constraints. If κ5〈S5〉  /  κ4〈S4〉 is equal to -  κ1〈S1〉  /  κ2〈S2〉 in eq. ([\ref=eqd]), we find that [formula] can play a role of the usual Higgs fields, where the mixing angle ζ is defined as tan ζ  =  κ1〈S1〉  /  κ2〈S2〉.

Now we discuss the masses and the flavor mixings in the quark and lepton sectors. We assume that U(1)F is broken by the VEV of the scalar component of S0 which takes a value nearly equal to Mpl. In the quark sector U(1)F controls the flavor mixing by regulating the number of S0 contained in each nonrenormalizable terms through the so-called Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism [\cite=fn]. If we introduce a parameter [formula], the quark mass matrix can be written as

[formula]

From these mass matrices we can obtain the mass eigenvalues and the CKM mixing as follows,

[formula]

This seems to have qualitatively nice features if we take λ  ~  0.22. In the lepton sector the charged lepton mass matrix has the same form as MTd because of the SU(5) relation and then we obtain

[formula]

A diagonalization matrix [formula] of the charged lepton mass matrix is found to be

[formula]

For the neutrino sector we can directly use the result in the previous simple model. Then, for example, if we take λ  ~  0.22, cos θ  ~  1 and [formula], we find that the solar and atmospheric neutrinos can be explained simultaneously and the LMA solution can be applied to the solar neutrino. The neutrino mass spectrum has a normal hierarchy in this case and the MNS-matrix can be written as

[formula]

Although the CHOOZ constraint is satisfied [\cite=ue3], the maximal mixing is not realized for the solar neutrino and we have a rather large value of UMNSe3 such as [formula]. This is an interesting prediction of this model. Neutrinoless double β-decay seems difficult to be found in the near future experiments since [formula] is so small. On the model parameters, if we take M0  ~  100 TeV and gU  ~  0.72, u should be 0.76 - 1.6 MeV. The U(1)X charges (q1,q2) should be in the region shown in Fig.2, in which we also draw the lines which represent a relation between q1 and q2 required by the previously mentioned various constraints. Because of the flavor dependent interactions of U(1)X, FCNC seems to give severe constraints on the model. However, if [formula] TeV and ξ  ~   <  ~  ~ 10- 6 are satisfied, the present experimental bounds for the FCNC can be satisfied.

Summary

In this talk we have discussed that the supersymmetry and the neutrino masses can be closely related by considering the R-parity violation. If we introduce a generation dependent extra U(1) gauge symmetry at a TeV region, the masses and mixings of neutrinos can be explained at a tree level due to the mixing among neutrinos and gauginos. Since the supersymmetry is a promising ingredient to solve the gauge hierarchy problem in the SM, it seems to be a very interesting possibility to explain the neutrino masses and mixings in relation to the supersymmetry.

Our model can be extended so as to include the quark sector straightforwardly. If we consider two Abelian flavor symmetries U(1)F  ×   U(1)X, the mass and mixing in both quark and lepton sectors seem to be successfully explained by both the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism and the neutrino-gaugino mixing.
