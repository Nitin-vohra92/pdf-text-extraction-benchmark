Study of Normal and Superconducting States of MgCNi3 upon Fe and Co Substitution and External Pressure

Introduction

The recent discovery[\cite=He2001] of superconductivity in the intermetallic compound MgCNi3 has initiated a number of studies aimed at elucidating the nature of its normal and superconducting states. Apart from the fact that it is the first known superconducting compound which has a perovskite structure without oxygen, the interest is mainly due to the preference of superconductivity over ferromagnetism which is rather unexpected in a compound whose main ingredient is Ni. By proposing an electronic analogy with the superconducting oxide perovskites, He et. al.[\cite=He2001] suggested that holes in the Ni d-states might be responsible for electrical conduction in this compound. The signs of the measured Hall constant[\cite=Li2001a] and thermoelectric power [\cite=Li2001b] are, however, consistent with normal state transport occurring mainly due to electron-like carriers. Most of the normal state transport properties, like the electrical resistivity ρ(T), Hall coefficient RH(T) and thermoelectric power S(T), show unusual temperature dependence. They are not amenable to a single unified description encompassing the low and high temperature regimes. For example, the Hall coefficient is almost temperature independent below 140K, but, its magnitude decreases[\cite=Li2001a] with increase in temperature above 140K. Even though the conventional Bloch-Gruneisen expression provides a good fit above 70K, a power law seems[\cite=Li2001a] to be better for ρ(T) below 70K. An electronic crossover occurring at T* ~   50K was proposed[\cite=Li2001b] to account for these anomalies. The normal state NMR properties of MgCNi3 are also anomalous[\cite=Singer2001] and similar to what is seen in the exotic superconductor Sr2RuO4. Observation[\cite=Mao2001] of a zero bias conductance peak in the tunneling spectrum is argued to be a signature of unconventional pairing (like in the case of Sr2RuO4) in this compound. The NMR measurement[\cite=Singer2001] below Tc, on the other hand, shows a coherence peak whose magnetic field dependence is consistent with s-wave pairing. The temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat below Tc   is consistent[\cite=Lin2002] with the conventional electron-phonon mechanism for superconductivity. Analysis[\cite=He2001] of the specific heat data suggests that this compound is a moderately strong-coupled (electron-phonon coupling constant λ ~   0.77) superconductor. The observed[\cite=Li2001a] temperature dependence of Hc2 is typical of a conventional superconductor in the dirty limit. Thus a complete understanding of the superconducting and normal states of this compound is yet to emerge.

There have been a number of first principle electronic structure calculations using Tight Binding Linear Muffin Tin Orbital (TB-LMTO)[\cite=valsa] [\cite=Dugdale2001] [\cite=Shim2001], Full Potential Linear Muffin Tin Orbital (FP-LMTO)[\cite=Shein2001] and Full Potential Linear Augmented Plane Wave (FP-LAPW)[\cite=Singh2001] [\cite=Kim2002] [\cite=Rosner2002] methods, within the Local Density Approximation (LDA), to understand the electronic and magnetic properties of MgCNi3   and related compounds. LDA+U calculations[\cite=Shim2001b] on MgCNi3  with U = 5 eV yields essentially the same band structure as that of the LDA, indicating that electron-correlation effects of Ni-3d electrons are unimportant in this compound. This is consistent with the fact that the measured value of the Wilson ratio[\cite=Wilsonratio] is only 1.15, typical of a system with modest electron-correlation effects. The results of these calculations are quite sensitive to the methods employed and also to the numerical values of the parameters. The general features of the band structure (which, however, are essentially the same in all these calculations) can be briefly summarised as follows: There is a strong hybridisation between the Ni-3d electrons and the C-2p electrons and thus carbon plays the crucial role of the mediator of electron hopping. Two of the bands cross the Fermi level Ef and hence both of them contribute to conduction. The density of states at the Fermi level (N(EF)) is predominantly due to Ni-3d electrons. One of the distinguishing features of the density of states of this compound is a sharp peak around 50 meV (its location is very sensitive to the method of calculation) below EF arising from the π anti-bonding states of Ni-3d and C-2p states. The Stoner enhancement[\cite=Stoner] is moderately strong to cause ferromagnetic spin fluctuations, but, not strong enough to obtain a ferromagnetic ground state.

It is well known that the perovskite structure is conducive to a variety of interesting physical phenomena like superconductivity, magnetism, colossal magnetoresistance, etc. Soon after the announcement[\cite=He2001] of the discovery of superconductivity in MgCNi3, TB-LMTO calculations were performed [\cite=valsa] to obtain guidelines for synthesis of related compounds with interesting physical properties. The results of the calculations for the pristine MgCNi3   are consistent with the reports now available in the literature[\cite=Dugdale2001] [\cite=Shim2001] [\cite=Shein2001] [\cite=Singh2001] [\cite=Kim2002] [\cite=Rosner2002]. Our calculations showed that MgCMn3, MgCFe3 and MgCCo3 may form, but they would be magnetic. Replacement of Mg with other alkaline-earth elements Ca, Sr and Ba would be interesting. For example, CaCNi3, CaCFe3 and SrCCo3 would be magnetic, whereas SrCNi3, BaCNi3 and CaCCo3 would be nonmagnetic. As mentioned earlier, band structure calculations showed that the Fermi level in MgCNi3 lies towards the right side of a peak in the Density of States (DOS) N(E). Removal of half an electron per formula unit would shift the Fermi level to the peak in the DOS. Within the rigid band approximation (RBA), this can be achieved by substitution of Ni3 by Ni5 / 2Co1 / 2 or Ni11 / 4Fe1 / 4. Our spin-polarised supercell calculations for MgCNi3 - xMx showed an increase (but much less than the RBA estimate) in N(EF), and more importantly, absence of a magnetic moment, for x=1/4 and 1/2 (M = Co) and x=1/4 (M = Fe). Hence an increase in Tc   is expected until x=1/2 for M = Co and x=1/4 for M = Fe. Furthermore, our calculations suggest a structural instability when the lattice parameter is changed either way. In particular, a lattice instability is conspicuous (in the calculation) at a modest estimated pressure of ~   2 GPa. Hence effect of application of pressure in this system would also be interesting. In what follows, we present the results of our analysis[\cite=geethadae] [\cite=awadheshdae] of the normal state resistance, the variation in superconducting properties upon Fe and Co substitution, and the effect of pressure on the superconducting transition temperature and normal state resistance of MgCNi3.

Sample Preparation and characterization

In addition to the pure MgCNi3, a series of compounds MgCNi3 - xMx ( x = 0.05, 0.15 and 0.30 for M = Fe; x=0.05, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.40 for M=Co) were prepared in order to investigate the effect of hole doping. The samples were prepared by following the solid state reaction route described by He et. al.[\cite=He2001]. Starting materials used were Mg(99.8%), Ni(99.99%), Fe(99.999%), Co(99.99%) and amorphous carbon(99%), all in the form of powder. 20% excess of Mg is taken in the starting mixture in order to compensate for the loss of Mg due to evaporation. Also an excess of 50% C is taken to obtain the optimum carbon stoichiometry[\cite=He2001] in the compound. The raw materials were mixed thoroughly and were pressed into pellets. The pellets were subjected to the heating schedule described by He et. al.[\cite=He2001], in an atmosphere of 92% Ar and 8% H2.

The crystal structure of all the samples are characterized by x-ray diffraction. Ac susceptibility and four-probe dc resistance have been measured in the range 4.2K -300K using home-made dip-sticks. The high pressure resistance measurement has been carried out for the pristine MgCNi3 using a pressure locked opposed Brigman anvils apparatus[\cite=awadesh] using the four-probe method. A superconducting Pb manometer is used for pressure calibration. We have also characterized the microstructure of MgCNi3 with SEM.

Results and Discussion

The x-ray patterns of the undoped and doped samples are consistent with a perovskite structure with the space group Pm[formula]m. Small amounts of unreacted Ni (2-5%) and MgO impurity (<  2%) were present in some of the samples. Except for these blemishes, all the samples are of good quality, with sharp x-ray diffraction peaks. The XRD pattern for MgCNi3 is shown in Fig. [\ref=figxray] as an example. The lattice parameter for the un-substituted MgCNi3 was found to be 3.810 (±   0.0004)Å which is in agreement with the values reported in the literature. No significant change in lattice parameter was noticed upon partial substitution of Ni with Fe or Co. This observation is consistent with the very small variation of the lattice parameter, a(x=0) = 3.806 Å, a(x=3) = 3.802 Å, seen in the study of MgCNi3 - xCox by Ren et. al.[\cite=Ren2001].

The variation of resistance R with temperature T of the pristine MgCNi3 is shown in Fig. [\ref=figrho]. It can be seen that the shape of the R(T) curve presented here is very similar those reported by He et. al.[\cite=He2001] and Li et. al.[\cite=Li2001a]. The residual resistivity ratio of this sample (R(300K) / R(10K)) is 2.2 similar to that obtained by He et. al.[\cite=He2001]. However, the magnitude of the resistivity obtained in this study is approximately 30 times more than that of He et. al.[\cite=He2001] and 10 times that of Li et. al[\cite=Li2001a]. This discrepancy can be understood in terms of the possible differences in the microstructure that can be expected from the fact that unlike in the study of He et. al.[\cite=He2001], our samples were not subjected to high pressure sintering. Fig. [\ref=figsem] shows an SEM pattern of one of the MgCNi3  samples. The fractal character of the sample, which is quite evident from this photograph, entails a much longer and corrugated path (as compared to the bulk) for the electrons. This makes the usual procedure of multiplying the resistance by the (external) Area/Length of the sample to get the resistivity ρ erroneous[\cite=badmetal]. Since the actual path length of the electrons in such a poorly connected medium is longer than that in the bulk, the apparent resistance will be larger than what is expected from a scaling based merely on the external geometry[\cite=badmetal]. Hence there is a need for a geometric renormalisation while converting resistance into resistivity in sintered samples. Our sample is more loosely packed (compared to that of He et. al.[\cite=He2001]) and hence the larger apparent resistivity of our sample. A superconducting transition with an onset (mid) Tc  of 8.13 K (7.69 K) is observed (90-10% of the transition width ΔTc  = 0.34K). The ac susceptibility measurement ([\ref=figchico]) shows a lower Tc  (onset Tc   = 7.35 K) consistent with the values reported in literature [\cite=He2001].

Analysis of Normal state Resistance

Assuming compliance with Matheissen's rule, we have tried to fit the normal state resistance of MgCNi3   with the expression for a conventional metal,

In Eq. [\ref=eqbg], the constant A represents the contribution to resistance from electron-impurity scattering, T2 term accounts for the contribution to resistance from electron-electron scattering and also from spin fluctuations, and last term is the Bloch-Gruneisen integral which represents the electron-phonon scattering. The coefficient B obtained using the fit turns out to be negative and also the fitted value of the Debye temperature ( Θ ~   110K) is too low. If we substitute this value of Θ and the reported value of the electron phonon coupling constant (λ = 0.77) in the McMillan's formula for Tc   given by

[formula]

we get the superconducting transition temperature Tc   ~   4 K, much less than the experimental value (we have taken μ* to be 0.1).

This and the reported [\cite=Li2001a] temperature variation of the Hall constant are consistent with a two band model of conduction involving [formula]light' electrons coupled to low frequency phonons and [formula]heavy' holes coupled to high frequency phonons[\cite=valsa]. As mentioned in the Introduction, band structure calculations show that two bands cross the Fermi level (see Fig. [\ref=figband]) one almost full and the other nearly empty. There are equal number of electron-like and hole-like charge carriers[\cite=numberexplanation] in this compound and the effective mass of the hole-like carrier is almost ten times that of the electron-like carrier. Therefore the normal state electrical conduction will be mainly due to electrons and hence we can expect the Hall constant to be negative. However, both the electrons and holes will be contributing to the conductivity σ(T) and hence it will be the sum of the conductivities σe(T) and σh(T) due to the electrons and holes, respectively. Therefore the effective resistivity ρ(T) can be written as

[formula]

where ρe(T) = 1 / σe(T) and ρh(T) = 1 / σh(T) , and A0 is a constant added to take care of the effect of defects in the sample. In Eq.[\ref=eqtwoband] ρe(T) and ρh(T) have separate temperature dependences, With Be and Bh both positive, it is possible to obtain an effective resistivity such that a fit with Eq. [\ref=eqbg] would give a negative B.

The continuous line in Fig. [\ref=figrho] is a fit[\cite=fitexplanation] of the normal state resistance, R(T) using the two band model for conduction given by Eq. [\ref=eqtwoband]. It can be seen from the figure that the fit is very good (better than 0.15%). Θe obtained from the fit is seen to be smaller than Θh. That is, the electron-like carriers are coupled to low frequency phonons as compared to hole-like carriers which are coupled to higher frequency phonons. Assuming the value of the hole-phonon coupling constant λ to be the same as that obtained from the specific heat measurement[\cite=He2001], we get a Tc comparable to the experimental value. Thus we can infer that superconductivity in MgCNi3 is due to hole-like carriers. Since ρe(T) is much less than ρh(T), the effective resistivity ρ(T) will be close to ρe(T) and hence the value of Θ that one gets with a fit of ρ(T) to Eq. [\ref=eqbg] will be close to Θe.

The reported variation of the Hall constant RH(T) can also be qualitatively explained in the two band model. The Hall constant RH(T) is the weighted sum of the Hall constants RHe and RHh due to the electrons and holes, respectively, and it is given by,

[formula]

Since the number of electrons is equal to the number of holes RHh = -RHe and hence RH <   0. If [formula] >   0, then the magnitude of RH also will decrease with temperature thus explaining the reported Hall effect behaviour. We thus see that a consistent interpretation of the temperature dependence of both the normal state resistivity and the Hall constant can be achieved by invoking a two band model of conduction. It remains to be seen whether the same physical picture can provide a satisfactory interpretation of the anomalies seen in the thermopower and NMR relaxation rate.

We have also tried to study the effect of the proximity of the peak in the density of states (van Hove singularity) close to the Fermi level on the resistivity. It is seen[\cite=valsa] that the chemical potential increases with temperature. As a result of this, some of the electrons from the almost filled band go to the almost empty band (nb(T) increases at the expense of na(T)[\cite=numberexplanation]). Thus the numbers of both the electron-like and hole-like carriers increase with temperature. As can be seen from Fig. [\ref=figcarrierconc], carrier concentration increases by approximately 4% when the temperature is raised from 0K to 300K. This is one of reasons why the resistivity is not linear in temperature even in the high temperature regime.

Effect of Fe and Co substitution

Figs. [\ref=figrhoco] and [\ref=figchico] represent the superconducting transitions traced by the resistance and susceptibility measurements respectively for the Co substituted compounds. The transition temperature decreases monotonically with increase in Co concentration, similar to the results now available in literature [\cite=Ren2001] [\cite=Hayward2001]. The variation of the mid point Tc with respect to x, the Co concentration, is shown as an inset of Fig. [\ref=figrhoco]. The decease in the diamagnetic signal (and hence the superconducting volume fraction) can also be seen in Fig. [\ref=figchico], which again is consistent with the results reported in the literature[\cite=Hayward2001]. Fe substitution, on the other hand, leads to an increase Tc  followed by a decrease. The superconducting transitions traced for the Fe substituted compounds are shown in Figs. [\ref=figrhofe] and [\ref=figchife]. The maximum Tc   is obtained when the Fe concentration is 0.05. The onset of the superconducting transition occurs at 9K for this sample in our resistivity scan. Increasing Fe concentration beyond 0.05 is found to suppress Tc. The inset of Fig. [\ref=figrhofe] represents the mid point Tc  as a function of Fe concentration.

An increase in Tc   was expected for Fe substitution till x=0.25 and for Co substitution till x=0.5, on the basis of a simple minded interpretation of the results of the band structure calculations. However, we observed a monotonic decrease in Tc   for Co substitution and an increase followed by a decrease for Fe substitution. These results are clearly at variance with what is expected from the band structure calculations. The observed variation in Tc   can be explained in terms of an increase in Tc   due to increase in the density of states and a decrease due to spin fluctuations: As mentioned in the Introduction, NMR measurements[\cite=Singer2001] have shown existence of ferromagnetic spin fluctuations in MgCNi3. Also, magnetic susceptibility measurements have demonstrated that Co doping enhances spin fluctuations in MgCNi3[\cite=Hayward2001]. If we assume the pairing in MgCNi3 is of the s-wave type, then it will be suppressed by coupling of electrons (more precisely, the holes) with spin fluctuations. Since we get an increase in Tc  for small concentrations of Fe, we believe that the spin fluctuation effect will be relatively less for Fe substituted compounds as compared to that of Co substituted ones. This is to be verified experimentally.

Effect of Pressure

Figure [\ref=figtotenergy] shows the variation of the total energy as a function of V / V0 (V0 is the equilibrium volume) obtained from our band structure calculations[\cite=valsa]. The clear change in slope at V / V0 ~   0.985 is suggestive of a possible lattice instability. The calculated (using TB-LMTO) bulk moduli of MgCNi3   and fcc Ni are 210 and 250 GPa, respectively. The measured bulk modulus of fcc Ni, on the other hand, is 180 GPa. Thus the LDA calculation over estimates the bulk modulus. We correct for this discrepancy by scaling the calculated bulk modulus by a factor 180/250 (the ratio of the measured and calculated bulk moduli of fcc Ni) and thus estimate the bulk modulus of MgCNi3  to be 151 GPa. With this value of the bulk modulus, we expect the lattice instability to occur at a pressure ~   2GPa. It is known that there is no structural or magnetic phase transitions in MgCNi3 as the temperature is varied, at ambient pressure[\cite=Huang2001]. But, there is no investigation of the structure of MgCNi3 at high pressure. It would be of interest to do high pressure x-ray diffraction on MgCNi3 to see if the predicted lattice instability indeed occurs or not. Here we report the results of resistivity measurement up to a pressure ~   7 GPa.

The superconducting transitions and the temperature dependence of resistivity of MgCNi3 traced for different external pressures are shown in Fig. [\ref=figrhohp]. Tc   is found to decrease with increasing pressure up to ~   1.7 GPa and it increases beyond this pressure. Fig. [\ref=figtcp] (a) depicts the variation of the onset Tc   with respect to the applied pressure. The normal state resistance also shows a similar trend as can be inferred from Fig. [\ref=figtcp] (b) where the variation of the resistance at 10 K is plotted as a function of the applied pressure. Thus the variation of Tc  with pressure is consistent with the behaviour expected of a superconductor with the conventional electron(hole)-phonon mechanism- larger the normal state resistivity, higher the Tc. Band structure calculations show a monotonic decrease in N(EF) with pressure. This would imply a monotonic decrease in the electron-phonon coupling constant λ, if there is no phonon softening. Fit of the resistance to Eq.[\ref=eqbg] showed an increase in Θ with pressure upto 2GPa and a decrease there-after. This implies a lattice softening commencing at 2GPa. If we assume the usual scaling (λ ~   N(EF) / Θ2) of the electron(hole)-phonon coupling constant with the density of states and the Debye temperature Θ, and calculate Tc  using McMillan's formula, we find a variation of Tc  with pressure that qualitatively matches with the experimental observation. It is not yet clear whether the decrease in θ with pressure beyond 2GPa is due to a softening of a particular phonon mode or due to a structural phase transition. Another mechanism that contributes to the increase in Tc  would be the suppression of spin fluctuations by pressure, thereby enhancing pairing.

Before concluding, we would like to touch upon the role of carbon, in relation to superconductivity, in this compound. It is known[\cite=Amos2002] that this compound can form with variable C stoichiometry. However, superconductivity is absent[\cite=He2001] [\cite=Amos2002] when the C content is less than ~   0.9. We have performed band structure calculation (using TB-LMTO) of MgC0.875Ni3 by constructing an appropriate supercell[\cite=valsa]. The density of states at the Fermi level thus calculated is almost the same as that of MgCNi3. Furthermore, MgC0.875Ni3 is non-magnetic as per this spin-polarised calculation. Thus the absence of superconductivity in MgCNi3 below a C concentration ~   0.9 is also surprising. We have, however, found a factor of two reduction in the height of the peak in DOS close to the Fermi level. This would support the proposal[\cite=Rosner2002] of a possible connection between the van Hove singularity and superconductivity in MgCNi3.

Conclusions

To conclude, we have synthesised MgCNi3  and analyzed its superconducting and normal state properties. We have also studied the effect of hole doping at the Ni site and the effect of application of pressure on MgCNi3. It is found that a two band model for conduction provides a framework for consistently explaining the observed temperature dependence of the normal state resistance and the Hall constant. Co substitution quenches superconductivity, whereas Fe substitution causes an increase in Tc  followed by a decrease. This may be understood in terms of a competition between increase in Tc   due to increase in the density of states at the Fermi level and a decrease due to spin fluctuations. We speculate that spin fluctuations in Fe substituted samples are weaker than in the Co substituted samples. In fact, it is known[\cite=Hayward2001] that there is an enhancement of spin fluctuations by Co substitution in MgCNi3. The observed nonmonotonic variation of Tc  with pressure may also be pointing out the importance of spin fluctuations vis-a-vis superconductivity in MgCNi3. The decrease in Tc  for small applied pressures can be understood in terms of the decrease in the density of states at the Fermi level. The subsequent increase in Tc  with pressure is suggestive of a lattice softening or a structural phase transition, consistent with the total energy calculations. More experimental and theoretical efforts are needed to understand these issues better.
