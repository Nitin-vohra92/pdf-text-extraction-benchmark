Radiation Induced Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert Damping in Ferromagnets

The description of ferromagnetic resonance damping in single domain samples is conventionally described by a transport coefficient in the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert dynamical equation of motion[\cite=1] [\cite=2]. In detail, if denotes the energy of the domain as a functional of magnetization and entropy, then the equation of motion is given by

[formula]

where the effective magnetic intensity

[formula]

and is the electronic gyromagnetic ratio. Experimental data are usually expressed in terms of the dimensionless tensor transport coefficient ; i.e.

[formula]

The transport (tensor) coefficient enters into the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation simply as an experimental parameter[\cite=3] [\cite=4] [\cite=5] [\cite=6] [\cite=7] [\cite=8] [\cite=9] [\cite=10] [\cite=11]. In spite of considerable effort, presently there is no generally accepted theoretical picture for the physical source of the irreversibility in ferromagnetic resonance. In simple magnon decay models[\cite=12], the ferromagnetic relaxation takes place in two stages. A magnon with virtually zero wave vector decays into one or more higher wave vector magnons. The resulting burst of magnetic energy is later distributed to phonon lattice vibrations[\cite=13] [\cite=14] [\cite=15]. Phonon modulations of the dipole-dipole and spin-orbit magnetic anisotropy were among the earliest of the relaxation mechanisms[\cite=16]. However, phonon mechanisms in clean crystals yielded magnetization decay times which were much too long when compared with experiment. The situation was partially remedied by the notion that the magnons could decay via the final density of states as determined by lattice imperfections[\cite=17] [\cite=18]. But the only somewhat shorter imperfect lattice relaxation times no longer had a convincingly correct experimental temperature dependence[\cite=19]. Also, the overall relaxation always remained longer than experiment. Furthermore, none of the above efforts in understanding take note of the experimental frequency dependence of damping widths in ferromagnetic resonance. There exists (in fact) an "impedance" as an analytic function of complex frequency (for ) whose real part

[formula]

describes dissipation.

The purpose of this work is to provide a simple formula for the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert impedance in terms of (frequency dependent) electrical conductivity of the ferromagnetic sample. The final result is that

[formula]

where the spatial average over the sample volume is defined as and the length scale is defined as

[formula]

The derivation of our central Eqs.(5) and (6) will be given in what follows.

The physical basis of our theory of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert impedance is as follows: (i) When a spin wave decays into excitations which heat the sample, the current radiates an electromagnetic field. (ii) The power per unit volume absorbed from the radiation by the sample via (say) simple frequency independent Ohmic heating would then be

[formula]

(iii) The eddy currents (produced by the electric field via conductivity) describe the heating mechanism for ferromagnetic resonance relaxation no matter what the excitation products. The specific excitations (for example phonon excitations with lattice impurities) are all made manifest via the conductivity .

In detail, consider the magnetic field produced by the magnetization in the magnetostatic limit; i.e. with

[formula]

If one now applies Faraday's law,

[formula]

to situations in which the magnetization varies slowly in time, then one finds a radiated electric field given by Eqs.(8) and (9) as

[formula]

If the magnetization is uniform in space within the ferromagnetic sample, then Eqs.(6) and (10) imply

[formula]

We note in passing that the internal electric field Eq.(11) is closely connected to the demagnetization field intensity equation

[formula]

for which the tensor

[formula]

It follows that . For a uniformly magnetized sample, Eq.(11) plays the same role for the internal electric field that Eq.(12) plays for the internal magnetic intensity. The power dissipation per unit volume in Eq.(7) may be evaluated using Eq.(11) yielding

[formula]

where is the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert transport coefficient tensor entering into Eqs.(1) and (2). Eq.(14) implies that

[formula]

The above Eq.(15) holds for the case in which and do not depend on frequency. If the conductivity depends on frequency , then Eq.(15) is easily generalized to Eqs.(4) and (5) which are the central results of this work. Note that the tensor nature of implies that ferromagnetic damping depends on the shape and size of the sample. This theoretical consequence of our theory is of experimental importance[\cite=20].

For the case of a thin film, the vector is in the direction of the normal unit vector to the film; i.e. . The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert transport coefficient tensor for a thin film of thickness is then

[formula]

In most experiments on ferromagnetic films . In the plane of the film, can then be described by an isotropic scalar ; i.e. where

[formula]

In terms vacuum impedance and the film resistance "per square" , one obtains the simple result

[formula]

Since increases with increasing temperature[\cite=21], one expects that should fall with increasing temperature. This is (in fact) an observed[\cite=22] [\cite=23] [\cite=24] [\cite=25] result.

We have presented above, a physical picture of how the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert damping of ferromagnetic resonance takes place. Just as a static magnetization produces a demagnetizing magnetic field intensity , a changing magnetization produces an electric field . The resulting Ohms law conduction current produces the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert damping magnetic field intensity . Thus the damping parameter is directly and simply related to the conductivity of the sample. For thin films, this relationship is given in Eq.(18). Previously puzzling temperature dependences of appear now as self evident.
