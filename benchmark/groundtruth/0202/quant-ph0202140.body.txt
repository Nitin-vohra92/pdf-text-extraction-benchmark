Comment on "Time-like flows of energy-momentum and particle trajectories for the Klein-Gordon equation"

Let [formula] (where P and S are real) solve the Klein-Gordon equation, [formula]. Set Pμ  =  ∂μP, Sμ  =  ∂μS, and

[formula]

That Pμ and Sμ are orthogonal is an exceptional case that we neglect, like the authors of [\cite=Dewdney2]. For Wμ one is supposed to take either [formula] or [formula], depending on which is timelike; they cannot both be timelike since they are orthogonal. The question is, could they both be spacelike?

The authors of [\cite=Dewdney2] declare that W+μ and W-μ cannot both be spacelike and argue like this: otherwise there exists a Lorentz frame such that W+0  =  0 and W-0  =  0, thus [formula], from which they conclude [formula], which is impossible.

It is correct that any two orthogonal spacelike vectors span a spacelike 2-plane (corresponding to x0  =  0 in the appropriate Lorentz frame), but no contradiction arises since in this case P0 would be 0 (in this frame). This is the mistake in the proof.

Together with W+0  =  0 (or W-0  =  0), P0  =  0 implies S0  =  0. Hence, for W+μ and W-μ to be spacelike it is necessary and sufficient that Pμ and Sμ span a spacelike 2-plane.

Can this case occur? Clearly: since the Klein-Gordon equation is of second order, one may choose ψ and ∂0ψ ad libitum on the x0 = 0 hyperplane. Can it also occur for the first-order Klein-Gordon equation [formula], or, equivalently, for functions from the positive-energy subspace? Here is an example: let ψ be a superposition of three plane waves

[formula]

with wave vectors [formula], [formula], [formula], and c1  =  3, [formula], [formula]. Then, at the coordinate origin, we find Pμ  =  (0,α, - α,0) and Sμ  =  (0, - β,0,0) with [formula], [formula] and [formula]. This example could also be made square-integrable by replacing the plane waves [formula] by positive-energy L2 Klein-Gordon functions φ(i)(x) with the properties φ(i)(0)  =  1 and [formula].

One may suspect, however, that perhaps this particular wave function ψ is very exceptional, and perhaps even that for this special wave function the coordinate origin is a rather atypical point, so that the sort of situation just described can be ignored. After all, we would be willing to ignore the case where Pμ and Sμ are orthogonal because in the 8-dimensional space of all possible pairs of vectors Pμ,Sμ it corresponds to a subset of dimension 7, and therefore one would expect that the space-time points where this happens form a set of measure zero.

But since W+μW+  μ and W-μW-  μ are continuous functions of Pμ and Sμ, the set of pairs Pμ,Sμ where both W+ and W- are spacelike is open (and nonempty) and thus has positive measure in 8 dimensions. I know of nothing precluding any pairs Pμ,Sμ from arising from a Klein-Gordon wave function, so it seems reasonable to expect that the space-time points with spacelike W+ and W- form a set of positive measure for many wave functions, perhaps for most.
