Exponents of quantum fixed-length pure state source coding

Introduction

As was proven by Schumacher [\cite=Schumacher], and Jozsa and Schumacher [\cite=JS], we can compress the unknown source state into the coding length [formula] with a sufficiently small error when the source state on n quantum systems obeys the n-independent identical distribution (i.i.d.) of the known probability p, where [formula] and H(ρ) is the von Neumann entropy [formula]. Jozsa and Schumacher's protocol depends on the mixture state [formula], and in this protocol, the coding length is independent for the input. Therefore, this type code is called a quantum fixed length source code.

Concerning the quantum source coding, there are two criteria: One is the blind coding, in which the input is an unknown quantum state. The other is the visible coding, in which the input is classical information that determines the quantum state, i.e., the encoder knows the input quantum state. When a source consists of pure states and depends on an i.i.d. distribution of the probability p, the bound of the compression rate (i.e. the minimum admissible rate) equals the entropy rate [formula]. The proof of this statement is divided into two parts: One is the possibility to compress the quantum source into a larger rate than the entropy rate, which is called the direct part. The other is the impossibility to compress the quantum source into a smaller rate than the entropy rate, which is called the converse part. The former is given by Schumacher's result. The latter was proven by Barnum et al. [\cite=Barnum] only in the blind case, however Horodecki [\cite=Horo] proved it in both cases by a simpler method. Winter[\cite=Winter] proved that the both settings have the strong converse property, i.e. if we compress into a smaller rate than the entropy rate, the average error goes to 1. Moreover, depending only on the coding length nR, Jozsa et al. [\cite=JH] constructed a code which is independent of the distribution which the input obeys. In their protocol, the average error tends to 0 when H(ρ)    <  R. Such a code is called a quantum universal fixed-length source code. Of course, we can consider a quantum variable-length source code, but discuss it in another paper [\cite=HayaMa].

However, only with the knowledge of the minimum admissible rate we cannot estimate what a compression rate is available for a given error δ    >  0 and a given integer n. For such an estimate, we need to discuss the decreasing speed of the average error for a fixed rate R. In the classical information theory, in order to treat this speed, we focus the exponential rate (exponent) of the error probability, and the optimal exponent is greater than zero when the coding rate R is greater than the entropy rate. Conversely, when the rate R is smaller than the entropy rate, the correct probability exponentially goes to zero. These optimal exponents have been already calculated by using type method. (see Csiszár and Körner [\cite=CK]).

In this paper, we treat only a quantum fixed-length code at both criteria in the case where any source consists of pure states. We optimize the exponents of the average error and the average fidelity in sec. [\ref=s3]. Using a group representation theoretical type method introduced in Appendix [\ref=appen2], we derive an upper bound of the error of the quantum universal fixed-length source code constructed by Jozsa et al. for any n and any R as ([\ref=12-7]), ([\ref=12-8]) and ([\ref=12-9]) in sec. [\ref=s4]. This upper bound yields its attainability of the optimal exponents. In sec. [\ref=s6], non-existence of a code exceeding the exponents is proven, which is called the converse part. In the converse part, an inequality is essential and is proven from Nielsen and Kempe's lemma [\cite=NK] in sec. [\ref=s5].

Summary of previous results

Blind and visible codes are mathematically formulated as follows. Assume that a quantum pure state ρi on H corresponding to label i∈Ξ is generated with probability pi . We denote the set of quantum states on H by S(H). Therefore, the source is described by {ρi,pi}i∈Ξ. In the blind setting, the encoder is described by a CP map E from S(H) to S(K), and the decoder is described by a CP map D from S(K) to S(H). The average error is given by [formula], and the average fidelity is given by [formula]. We call a triple (K,E,D) a blind code.

In the visible setting, the encoder is described by a map F from Ξ to S(K). Then, the average error is given by [formula]. In this setting, we treat the trade-off between decreasing dim K and ε(F,D). We call a triple (K,E,D) a blind code. Similarly, we call a triple (K,F,D) a visible code. In the both settings, we treat the trade-off between decreasing dim K and ε(E,D) (ε(F,D)).

A blind code (K,E,D) can be regarded as a visible code in the case where F(i): = E(ρi). We have more choices in the visible setting than in the blind setting. A blind code is used for saving memories in quantum computing. A visible code is used for efficient use of quantum channel in quantum cryptography, for example, the B92 protocol [\cite=B92], [\cite=BCFJS].

In the n-i.i.d. setting, the quantum state [formula] on the tensored Hilbert space [formula] generates with the probability [formula], where [formula]. This setting is written by the source [formula], which is called a n-discrete memoryless source (DMS) generated by the source {ρi,pi}i∈Ξ. Now, we define the minimum admissible rate RB({ρi,pi}i∈Ξ) (RV({ρi,pi}i∈Ξ)) and the converse minimum admissible rate R-B({ρi,pi}i∈Ξ) (R-V({ρi,pi}i∈Ξ)) of the DMS generated by {ρi,pi}i∈Ξ in the blind setting (in the visible setting) as follows, respectively.

[formula]

The following theorem is a known result.

The equations

[formula]

hold, where [formula] and H(ρ) denotes von Neumann entropy [formula].

Since the following relations

[formula]

are trivial, it is sufficient for ([\ref=1]) to prove

[formula]

Schumacher [\cite=Schumacher] proved the direct part: [formula], and Jozsa-Schumacher [\cite=JS] simplified it. Barnum et al. [\cite=Barnum] proved the weak converse part: [formula] of the blind case, and Horodecki [\cite=Horo] proved the weak converse part: [formula] of the visible case, which is a stronger argument than the one of the blind case. Winter [\cite=Winter] obtained the strong converse part: [formula]. Moreover, Petz and Mosonyi [\cite=PM] treated the general stationary case, in which there are memory effects.

Main results

Next, we define the exponents of the average error (the reliable functions) re,B(R|{ρi,pi}i∈Ξ) and re,V(R|{ρi,pi}i∈Ξ), and the exponents of the average fidelity (the converse reliable functions) r*e,B(R|{ρi,pi}i∈Ξ) and r*e,V(R|{ρi,pi}i∈Ξ) by

[formula]

The following is the main theorem.

Assume that 0  ≤  R    <   log d and d =  dim H. We diagonalize [formula] as [formula] such that ai  ≥  ai + 1. Then, [formula] is a probability distribution on [formula]. The relations

[formula]

hold, where ψ(s) denotes the Rény entropy [formula], [formula] denotes the quantum relative entropy [formula], and [formula] denotes a probability on [formula].

Our proof of Theorem [\ref=T20] is outlined as follows. Since any blind code can be demonstrated as a visible code, the relations

[formula]

are trivial. In sec.[\ref=s4], we universally construct the optimal quantum fixed-length code with the rate R. This construction is independent of [formula], and depends only on the rate R. From this construction, we obtain

[formula]

which is called the direct part. In sec. [\ref=s6], we prove

[formula]

which is called the converse part. The equivalence between RHSs of ([\ref=12-1]),([\ref=12-3]) and ([\ref=T2.1]) (([\ref=12-2]),([\ref=12-4]) and ([\ref=T4.1])) is proven in Appendix [\ref=appen1], respectively.

The inequality [formula] was proven by Winter [\cite=Winter].

We can adopt another criteria for error as:

[formula]

Note that [formula] equals Bures distance. In this case, we can define other reliable functions re,B,b(R|{ρi,pi}i∈Ξ) and re,V,b(R|{ρi,pi}i∈Ξ), and other converse reliable functions r*e,B,b(R|{ρi,pi}i∈Ξ) and r*e,V,b(R|{ρi,pi}i∈Ξ) by

[formula]

As proven in Appendix [\ref=apec], the following relations between two criteria

[formula]

hold.

Construction of a universal fixed-length source code to achieve the optimal rate

We construct a universal quantum fixed-length source code to achieve the optimal rate in Theorem [\ref=T20]. For any r    >  0 and R    >  0, the set [formula] is covariant for the actions of the d-dimensional special unitary group [formula], and any n-i.i.d. distribution pn is invariant for the action of the n-th symmetric group Sn on the tensored space [formula]. Thus, our code should satisfy the invariance for these actions on [formula].

Now, we focus on the irreducible decomposition of the tensored space [formula] concerning the representations of Sn and [formula], and define the Young index [formula] as,

[formula]

and denote the set of Young indices [formula] by Yn. Young index [formula] uniquely corresponds to the irreducible unitary representation of Sn and the one of [formula]. Now, we denote the representation space of the irreducible unitary representation of Sn ([formula]) corresponding to [formula] by [formula] ([formula]), respectively. In particular, regarding a unitary representation of [formula], Young index [formula] gives the highest weight of the corresponding representation. Then, the tensored space [formula] is decomposed as follows; i.e. [formula] is equivalent with the following direct sum space under the representation of Sn and [formula].

[formula]

Since this representation of the group [formula] is unitary, any irreducible components [formula] are orthogonal with one another. For details, see Weyl [\cite=Weyl], Goodman and Wallach [\cite=GW], and Iwahori [\cite=Iwa]. The efficiency of this representation method was discussed from several viewpoints. Regarding fixed-length source coding, it was discussed by Jozsa et. al. [\cite=JH]. Regarding quantum relative entropy, it was by Hayashi[\cite=H1997]. Regarding quantum hypothesis testing, it was by Hayashi[\cite=H2001]. Regarding estimation of spectrum, it was by Keyl and Werner[\cite=KW].

Next, we construct a blind code with rate R. We define the Hilbert space KR,n, the blind encoder ER,n, the visible encoder FR,n and the decoder DR,n by

[formula]

where we denote the projection to KR,n by PR,n.

We define Rn by

[formula]

The rates of the blind code {(KR,n,ER,n,DR,n)} and the visible code {(KR,n,FR,n,DR,n)} satisfies

[formula]

When the mixture [formula] of the source is diagonalized as [formula], we can evaluate the average errors as

[formula]

where [formula] is defined as [formula] and [formula] denotes a probability on [formula]. Taking the limit, we obtain

[formula]

Inequalities ([\ref=12-5]) and ([\ref=12-6]) imply ([\ref=12-1]) and ([\ref=12-2]), respectively. Conversely, the opposite inequalities of ([\ref=12-5]) and ([\ref=12-6]) are guaranteed by inequalities ([\ref=12-3]) and ([\ref=12-4]).

The subspace KRn,n is equal to the subspace Υ introduced by Jozsa et al. [\cite=JH] because both are invariant for the action of the symmetric group. Therefore, our code ERn,n coincides with their protocol.

Even if the source states ρi are not pure, we can prove inequalities similar to ([\ref=12-7]), ([\ref=12-8]) and ([\ref=12-9]) by using some calculations similar to Appendix C in Hayashi and Matsumoto[\cite=HayaMa]. However, in this case, this exponent does not seem to be optimal.

Using Lemma [\ref=L110], we can evaluate as

[formula]

Thus, we obtain ([\ref=10-1]). The average error of the visible code can be calculated as

[formula]

Therefore, Lemma [\ref=lee] guarantees ([\ref=12-7]) and ([\ref=12-9]). Conversely,

[formula]

which implies ([\ref=12-8]).

Necessary inequality for the converse part

For an Hermitian matrix X, we define the projections {X  ≥  0},{X    <  0} by

[formula]

where the spectral decomposition of X is given by [formula] (sj is an eigenvalue corresponding to projection Ej). Under a source {ρi,pi}i∈Ξ, the following lemma holds.

Any visible code (K,F,D) satisfies the following inequalities

[formula]

for [formula].

Moreover, the inequality

[formula]

holds for [formula].

For our proof of the above lemma, we require the following two lemmas.

The set of visible encoders from Ξ to S(K) coincides with the convex hull of the set of extremal points, which equals

[formula]

If a visible encoder F satisfies that f(i) is a pure state for any i∈Ξ, then F is an extremal point. It is sufficient to show that for any visible encoder [formula] is written by a convex hull of ([\ref=a1]). A visible encoder [formula] defined by

[formula]

belongs to ([\ref=a1]). Since the relation [formula] holds, we obtain the lemma.

The set of decoders from S(K) to S(H) coincides with the convex hull of the subset

[formula]

From the Steinspring representation theorem, there exist a Hilbert space K' and a unitary U on [formula] and an element [formula] such that

[formula]

Assume that [formula]. Then, the decoder Dj:

[formula]

belongs to ([\ref=a2]). Since [formula], the proof is complete.

For a proof of Lemma [\ref=L1], an entanglement viewpoint plays a essential role. A state [formula] is called separable if there exist states ρA,i∈S(HA),ρB,i∈S(HB) and a probability pi such that

[formula]

The following lemma was proven from the viewpoint of entanglement by Nielsen and Kempe [\cite=NK].

When the state [formula] is separable, the inequality

[formula]

holds for any integer k, where [formula].

From Lemma [\ref=L81] and Lemma [\ref=L82], it is sufficient to show the inequalities ([\ref=L10]), ([\ref=L20]) and ([\ref=L21]) for the pair an encoder F belonging to ([\ref=a1]) and a decoder D belonging to ([\ref=a2]). Assume that the Hilbert space H' satisfies that [formula]. The state [formula] is pure and satisfies that [formula]. Since [formula], there exists a pure state σi∈S(H') such that [formula]. Since the state [formula] is separable and [formula], Lemma [\ref=L7] guarantees that

[formula]

Since [formula], we have [formula]. The relations

[formula]

hold. The relations [formula] and [formula] imply that

[formula]

Assume that P is a projection on H whose rank is dim K, then

[formula]

Thus, we obtain

[formula]

From ([\ref=h11]), ([\ref=L24]), ([\ref=kore]) and ([\ref=h12]),

[formula]

We obtain ([\ref=L20]). Since [formula], the inequalities ([\ref=L10]) and ([\ref=L20]) hold. Applying Markov inequality ([\ref=Ma]) given in Appendix [\ref=AMa] to the probability [formula] and the random variable ati, we obtain the inequality

[formula]

where [formula] are eigenvalues of [formula]. Substituting 1 + t for s, we obtain ([\ref=L21]).

Assume that D is not a CP map but a positive map. In this case, the inequality

[formula]

holds for [formula] instead of ([\ref=L20]). This inequality is proven in Appendix [\ref=aped].

Proof of the converse part of Theorem [\ref=T20]

First, using Lemma [\ref=L1], we prove inequality ([\ref=12-3]).

[formula]

Assume that a sequence of visible codes {(Kn,Fn,Dn)} satisfies that

[formula]

It follows from ([\ref=L10]) in Lemma [\ref=L1] that

[formula]

When [formula],

[formula]

Therefore, we have

[formula]

Now, applying ([\ref=Cra4]) to the random variable -   log ai under the probability distribution [formula], we obtain

[formula]

where the definition of s(S) is given in Lemma [\ref=L11] in Appendix [\ref=appen1]. When H(ρ)    <  S   <  - ψ'(0),

[formula]

When H(ρ)    <  R    <   log d  =  ψ(0) =   -  ψ'(0) - η( - ψ'(0)), we obtain

[formula]

When 0  ≤  R  ≤  H(ρ), we obtain

[formula]

Using Lemma [\ref=L9], we obtain ([\ref=12-3]).

Next, we prove ([\ref=12-4]). Assume that a sequence of visible codes {(Kn,Fn,Dn)} satisfies that

[formula]

When H(ρ)  ≤  R, it is trivial that

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=L9] implies ([\ref=12-4]).

Assume that a1  =  ak    >  ak + 1 and log k    <  R    <  H(ρ). Since [formula], substituting λ: =  - nSR and s: = s(SR)  ≥  1 into ([\ref=L21]), we have

[formula]

Note that the definitions of SR,s(S) are given in Lemma [\ref=L11]. Since SR - R  =  SR(1 - s(SR))  -  ψ(s(SR)), we have

[formula]

where the last inequality follows from [formula] obtained from ([\ref=s323]). From Lemma [\ref=L9], we obtain ([\ref=12-4]).

Assume that 0  ≤  R  ≤   log k. Substituting λ: =  - n(  -   log a1  -  ε) into ([\ref=L21]), we have

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula]. Since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Arbitrarity of ε    >  0 implies

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=L9] implies ([\ref=12-4]).

Discussion

When the source ρi is mixed and has no trivial redundancies, Koashi and Imoto [\cite=KI] proved that the bound RB equals H(ρ) in the blind case. Lemma [\ref=L3] holds for the mixed case. However, its optimality is not proven in the sense of exponents in the mixed case. In this case it may not be optimal.

It is interesting that our exponent corresponds to the exponents of the variable-length universal entanglement concentration given by Hayashi and Matsumoto[\cite=HM] and the fixed-length entanglement concentration given by Hayashi et. al.[\cite=HKMMW]. However, our error exponent corresponds to the success exponent of [\cite=HM], and our fidelity exponent corresponds to the failure exponents of [\cite=HM] and [\cite=HKMMW]. Note that in [\cite=HKMMW] the optimal exponent r is given as the function of the rate R while in this paper and [\cite=HM], the rate R is given as a function the optimal exponent r. In addition, in quantum hypothesis testing, an error exponent similar to ([\ref=T2]) is given in Ogawa and Hayashi[\cite=O-H].

Equivalence between different characterizations

In the classical case, the exponent has two forms [\cite=CK][\cite=Blahut][\cite=CL]. Following Ogawa and Nagaoka [\cite=Oga-Nag:test], we prove this equivalence in the quantum source coding case. In this section we treat a state [formula], and the function [formula], where ai  ≥  ai + 1. We assume that a1  =  ak    >  ak + 1 and d  =   dim H.

If -   log a1    <  S  ≤    -  ψ'(0) and log k    <  R    <   log d, we can uniquely define s(S)  ≥  0 and SR such that

[formula]

Conversely, when R  ≤   log k,

[formula]

Since

[formula]

for s   > 0, the function -  ψ'(s) is monotone decreasing. Because lim s  →    ∞  -  ψ'(s) =  log a1, s(S) is uniquely defined in ( -  log a1,  -  ψ'(0)].

When S∈( -  log a1,  -  ψ'(0)], we can calculate

[formula]

As shown latter, the equation

[formula]

holds. Since

[formula]

SR also is uniquely defined. The inequality [formula] yields ([\ref=hh11]).

Finally, we show ([\ref=12-09]). We calculate as

[formula]

The terms [formula] and [formula] exponentially go to 0 as s  →    ∞  . The term [formula] goes to 1. Thus, we obtain ([\ref=12-09]).

When log k    <  R    <   log d, the equations

[formula]

hold, where σ is a state on H and [formula] is a probability on [formula]. When 0  ≤  R  ≤   log k, the equations

[formula]

hold. When H(ρ)    <  R    <   log d,

[formula]

When log k    <  R    <  H(ρ),

[formula]

When 0  ≤  R  ≤   log k,

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=kk-1]) follows from ([\ref=s323]). Equation ([\ref=s323]) yields

[formula]

Substituting the above equation into SR - R, we obtain ([\ref=kk]). We prove ([\ref=kk2]). Assume that log k    <  R    <   log d. Letting [formula], we calculate

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=s323]) guarantees that H(ρs(SR)) = R. Assuming that H(σ) = R, we have

[formula]

i.e.,

[formula]

It implies that

[formula]

Note that ρs is commutative with ρ. Equation ([\ref=s323]) yields

[formula]

Then, we obtain ([\ref=kk2]).

Next, we proceed ([\ref=hh1]) and assume that 0  ≤  R  ≤   log k. When H(σ) = R,

[formula]

Let [formula] be a probability whose entropy is R. Then we have

[formula]

Thus, we obtain ([\ref=hh1]), which implies ([\ref=hh8]).

Taking the derivative with respect to R in ([\ref=s323]), we have

[formula]

From ([\ref=s324]), we have

[formula]

Thus, the function R  ↦  SR - R is convex, and [formula] if and only if s(SR) = 1, i.e. R = H(ρ). The function takes minimum value 0 at R = H(ρ) because SH(ρ) - H(ρ) = 0. Therefore, we obtain ([\ref=hh2]), ([\ref=hh5]), ([\ref=hh3]), ([\ref=hh7]), and ([\ref=hh32]).

Next, we discuss the other forms described by ψ. We can calculate the derivatives as

[formula]

where the last inequality follows from ([\ref=b2]). In ([\ref=b1]) and ([\ref=b2]), the equalities hold if and only if s = 0.

Assume log k    <  R    <   log d. Since it follows from ([\ref=s324]) and ([\ref=s323]) that

[formula]

the equation

[formula]

holds. Relation ([\ref=h9]) implies that the function R  ↦  s(SR) strictly monotonically decreases, and s(SR)  ≥  1 if and only if R  ≤  H(ρ). Therefore,

[formula]

Note that [formula]. We obtain ([\ref=kk4]), ([\ref=hh6]), ([\ref=hh4]) and ([\ref=kk5]).

When 0  ≤  R  ≤   log k, Lemma [\ref=L11] guarantees that the RHS of ([\ref=hh10]) is positive for any s    >  0. Thus,

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

We obtain ([\ref=hh4]) and ([\ref=hh9]).

Representation theoretical type methods

In this section, we prove the following two lemmas used in our proof of Lemma [\ref=L3]. We assume that [formula] and d is the dimension of H.

The relations

[formula]

hold, where [formula] is defined as

[formula]

Inequality ([\ref=h20]) is trivial. Using Young index [formula], the basis of [formula] is described by [formula], where the set [formula] is defined as

[formula]

Thus, we obtain ([\ref=h21]). Note that the correspondence [formula] and [formula] depends on the choice of Cartan subalgebra, i.e. the choice of basis of H.

According to Weyl [\cite=Weyl], and Iwahori [\cite=Iwa], the following equation holds and is evaluated as:

[formula]

Thus, we obtain ([\ref=a4]). As an opposite inequality, we have

[formula]

where the last inequality follows from

[formula]

which is easily proven by the type method [\cite=CK]. We obtain ([\ref=a4-1]).

The following is essentially equivalent to Keyl and Werner's result [\cite=KW]. For the reader's convenience, we give a simpler proof.

The following relations

[formula]

hold, where R is a subset consisting of probabilities on [formula] and we denote the projection to [formula] by [formula].

Let [formula] be an irreducible representation of SU(d) in [formula], which is equivalent to [formula]. We denote its projection by [formula]. Now, we choose the basis [formula] of [formula] depending the basis {ei} of H. The base [formula] is the eigenvector of [formula] with the eigenvalue [formula]. Since [formula] is majorized by [formula], we can calculate the operator norm by

[formula]

where [formula]. from ([\ref=h21]), ([\ref=a4-2]) and ([\ref=a5]), the relations

[formula]

hold, where we denote the multinomial distribution of [formula] by [formula]. Inequality ([\ref=h20]) guarantees

[formula]

Thus, we obtain inequality ([\ref=e31]). Inequality ([\ref=h20]) guarantees that

[formula]

which implies inequality ([\ref=e32]). From ([\ref=a5]), we have

[formula]

Therefore, we obtain inequalities ([\ref=f-e31]) and ([\ref=f-e32]).

Proof of ([\ref=h17]), ([\ref=h16]), ([\ref=h27]) and ([\ref=h26])

Since

[formula]

the inequalities

[formula]

hold. Similarly, we can prove that

[formula]

Using Jensen's inequality, we have

[formula]

Thus, we obtain the opposite inequality from ([\ref=h15]) and then obtain ([\ref=h16]). Similarly, we can prove ([\ref=h17]).

Proof of ([\ref=L52])

For any visible code (K,F,D), we define an operator T by [formula]. The operator inequality

[formula]

holds for any projection P. It is sufficient for ([\ref=opi]) to show the pure state case. The pure state case of ([\ref=opi]) is directly proven using the inequality 2(|x|2  +  |y|2)  ≥  |x + y|2 for any two complex numbers x,y. Therefore,

[formula]

The inequality [formula] follows from the inequality [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

From the relations [formula] and D(F(i))  ≥  0, we can prove

[formula]

It follows from ([\ref=3]) and ([\ref=4]) that

[formula]

From ([\ref=5.1]) and ([\ref=2]), we have

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

Since [formula], we have

[formula]

From ([\ref=5]), ([\ref=6]) and ([\ref=7]), we obtain ([\ref=L20]).

Markov inequality and Cramér's Theorem

In this section, we summarize Markov inequality and Cramér's Theorem which are applied in this paper. Let p be a probability distribution and X be a positive real valued random variable. For any real number c   > 0, we can easily prove the inequality

[formula]

where Ep presents the expectation under the distribution p. This inequality is called Markov inequality.

This inequality can be used for large deviation evaluation as follows. Let Y be a real valued random variable. In the n-i.i.d. setting, we focus on the random variable.

[formula]

where Yi is the i-th random variable identical to Y. Applying Markov inequality for the random variable etYn, we have

[formula]

for t  ≥  0, which is equivalent to

[formula]

where φ(t): =  log EP( exp (tY)). Therefore,

[formula]

Conversely, the inequality

[formula]

holds, where [formula]. For a proof of ([\ref=Cra1]), see Chapter II of Bucklew[\cite=Buck]. The pair of ([\ref=Cra2]) and ([\ref=Cra1]) is called Cramér's Theorem.

In the following, we discuss the case φ(t) is convex and differentiable. We define three real numbers x1,x2 and x3 as

[formula]

For any x∈(x2,x1), we can uniquely define t(x) as

[formula]

Then,

[formula]

where the last equation follows from

[formula]

Thus, we obtain

[formula]

except for x = x1.
