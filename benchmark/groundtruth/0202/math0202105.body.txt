Classification of three-dimensional exceptional log canonical hypersurface singularities

Introduction

In this paper the classification of three-dimensional exceptional hypersurface singularities started in [\cite=Kud3] is completed. The main classification theorem is the following one:

It follows from the classification that there are only finite number of types of three-dimensional exceptional log canonical hypersurface singularities. There is a conjecture that the similar result about the finite number of types is true in any dimension for the exceptional singularities. See also examples [\cite=Kud3].

The present paper is the direct continuation of [\cite=Kud3]. Therefore see [\cite=Kud3] in connection with the notations, definitions and etc.

The paper is organized in the following way. In chapter § 1 the purely log terminal blow-ups of not well-formed singularities are studied. In chapter § 2 the three-dimensional quasihomogeneous not well-formed singularities are considered. In chapter § 3 the summarizing tables are written.

I am grateful to Professor Yu.G.Prokhorov for useful discussions and valuable remarks.

Structure of purely log terminal blow-up of not well-formed singularity

Now we explain in detail the condition of well-formedness of quasihomogeneous singularity.

Let [formula] be a quasihomogeneous log canonical, canonical outside 0 singularity with the integer weights [formula] and quasihomogeneous degree d defined by a polynomial [formula]. Without loss of generality it can be assumed that [formula].

Consider [formula]-blow-up [formula]. The exceptional divisor of ψ is the weighted projective space [formula]. This blow-up induces a plt blow-up [formula] (see theorem 2.13 [\cite=Kud3]). Put [formula]. Then [formula]. Put [formula] if i  ≠  j. The quasihomogeneous degree of [formula] is denoted by d̃.

[\cite=Fletcher] In the above-mentioned notations the quasihomogeneous singularity is called well-formed singularity if one of the following equivalent conditions holds:

[formula];

One have qij|d̃ for all i  ≠  j.

In opposite case our singularity is called not well-formed singularity. Let us remark that if we choose the other quasihomogeneous weights then it can happen that the condition of well-formedness is not fulfilled. For the weakly exceptional and consequently for the exceptional singularity the primitive vector [formula] is unique [\cite=Kud3] and therefore the notion of well-formedness is uniquely defined.

Put [formula]

[formula]

where the divisors Ci and Cij on E are defined by the equations xi = 0 and xi = xj = 0 respectively. Moreover [formula]= [formula], where qi  ≠  1.

To calculate the different we have to determine the codimension 2 components of [formula] in [formula] which are lying in E. The variety [formula] in the affine piece [formula] of [formula]-blow-up is given by a polynomial [formula]. It is clear that the singularity defined by this polynomial g' has the codimension not less then 3 in [formula] and hence doesn't influence on [formula] (recall that [formula] is given by a polynomial g' in [formula]). Thus [formula] appears only because of the action of cyclic group. Since [formula] then it remains to show the following statement: if [formula] then {xi = xj = 0} defines a divisor on E. Actually, this condition means that xi or xj divides any monomial of g.

If [formula] then [formula]. Moreover, if qi > 1 and [formula] then qj = 1. Indeed, if qj > 1 then [formula]. Hence g defines a nonnormal singularity.

The next proposition is proved in the same way as the previous proposition [\ref=diff].

[formula]

(cf. [\cite=I]) Let [formula] be a quasihomogeneous strictly log canonical, canonical outside 0 singularity with weight p. Then it is well-formed (by theorem 2.13 [\cite=Kud3] it is exceptional).

Let [formula] be a plt blow-up. Since [formula] is Cartier divisor then [formula]. Hence by propositions [\ref=diff] and [\ref=diffp] [formula]. In particular E is K3 surface with Du Val singularities if n = 4 [\cite=Fletcher].

Let [formula] be a weakly exceptional Du Val singularity defined by a polynomial h. Then h is one of the following polynomials: x21 + x22x3 + xn - 13, n  ≥  4 (type [formula]); x21 + x32 + x43 (type [formula]); x21 + x32 + x33x2 (type [formula]); x21 + x32 + x53 (type [formula]) (see [\cite=Pr2]). Consider [formula]-blow-ups corresponding to their quasihomogeneous weights. Then the singularities [formula], n  ≥  5 and [formula] are not well-formed.

Let us define a [formula]-divisor [formula] on [formula] and a [formula]-divisor [formula] on E. Recall that, if (X,0) is a well-formed singularity then [formula] (cf. [\cite=Kud3]). Nevertheless the following proposition takes place in the general case.

[formula].

By proposition [\ref=diffp], remark [\ref=view] and corollary [\cite=Sh1] [formula]. By proposition [\ref=diff] the last expression is equal to [formula].

Let us return to the example [\ref=ex1]. Then

Investigation of three-dimensional not well-formed singularities on exceptionality

The next theorem is proved by exhaustion of all cases. This sorting is described in [\cite=Kud3].

All three-dimensional not well-formed exceptional canonical quasihomogeneous singularities can be obtained by the rotations of Newton's line passing through the following parts of type M2:

(1) t2 + z3 + xm, where xm -- zx5, zx5y, zx7, zx6y, zx5y2.

(2) t2 + z4 + xm, where xm -- zx4, zx5, zx4y.

(3) all parts of type Υ(2)2 (they have the equation of the form t2 + z3x + h(z,x,y)).

(4) t2 + z3y + xm, where xm -- x7y, x8y, zx5, zx6, zx5y.

(5) t2 + z5 + zx5; t2 + z4x + xm, where xm -- x6, x5y, x4y2, zx5, zx4y, zx3y2; t2 + z4y + xm, where xm -- x5y, zx5, zx4y; t2 + z3x2 + xm, where xm -- zx5, zx4y, zx3y2; t2 + z3y2 + zx5; t2 + z3xy + xm, where xm -- x6, x5y, x7, x6y, x5y2, zx5, zx4y; t2 + z5 + zx3y; t2 + z4x + zx3y; t2 + z4x + x4y; t2 + z3x2 + zx3y.

(6) t3 + z2xy + x5; t3 + z2xy + x4y; t3 + z4 + zx2y; t3 + z4 + tx3; t3 + z3x + xm, where xm -- zx2y, x3y, tx3, tx2y; t3 + z3y + tx3; t3 + tz3 + xm, where xm -- z2x2, zx3, zx2y; t3 + tz2x + zx2y; t3 + tz2x + x2y2; g3(t,z) + zx3, where g3 is a binary form of degree 3; t3 + z2x + xm, where xm -- x4, x5, x4y, x6 + tx4, x5y, x4y2, x7, x6y, x5y2, x4y3, x8, x7y, x6y2, x5y3, x4y4, tx3, tx3y, tx5, tx4y, tx3y2; t3 + z2y + x7y; t3 + z2y + tx5.

(7) t2z + g4(z,x), where g4 is a binary form of degree 4; t2z + z4 + xm, where xm -- x3y, x5, x4y, x3y2, tx3, tx2y;t2z + z3x + xm, where xm -- x3y, x5, x4y, x3y2, tx3, tx2y; t2z + z3y + xm, where xm -- x5, x4y, zx3, z2x2, tx3; t2z + z2x2 + xm, where xm -- x5, x4y, x3y2, tx2y; t2z + z2xy + x5; t2z + z2xy + x4y; t2z + z2x + xm, where xm -- x4, zx3 + x5, x4y, x6, x5y, x4y2, tx3, tx4, tx3y; t2z + z2y + xm, where xm -- x5y, zx3, tx4.

(8) t2x + z4 + xm, where xm -- x3y, x5, x4y, zx2y, zx4, zx3y, zx2y2; t2x + z3x + xm, where xm -- x2y2, x5, x4y, x3y2, x2y3, x6, x5y, x4y2, x3y3, x2y4, zx2y, zx4, zx3y, zx2y2; t2x + z3y + xm, where xm -- x5, x4y, x6, x5y, x4y2, zx4, zx3y, z2x2.

(9) t2y + z4 + zx4; t2y + z3x + xm, where xm -- x5, x6, x5y, zx4, tx3.

In investigating given singularities on the exceptionality it is convenient to use the proposition [\cite=Kud3] and corollary [\cite=Kud3]. In general case corollary [\cite=Kud3] is formulated in the following way.

Let [formula] be a three-dimensional quasihomogeneous log canonical singularity with the weight p. Assume that (X,H) is not lc for any hyperplane section H. Let [formula] (see definition [\ref=def1]). If [formula] for some k then (X,0) is exceptional.

Suppose that (X,0) is not exceptional. Let HX  =  {xk = 0}|X be a hyperplane section and let [formula] be a proper transform of HX on [formula]. Then [formula]. Let [formula], where Cki are the irreducible curves (see proposition [\ref=diff]). One have [formula]. The coefficients dki  ≥  6 / 7 for all i since [formula] [\cite=Sh1]. By proposition [\cite=Kud3] there exists 1,2,3,4 or 6-complement D+. By the definition of complement we have [formula]. Therefore [formula] is nef and lc. Since [formula], where {xk = 0} is the corresponding divisor on [formula] then [formula]. Hence a  ≥  0 and (X,HX) is lc. This contradiction concludes the proof.

Proposition [\ref=DelPezzo3] is hypothetically true in any dimension (see [\cite=Kud3]). In the two-dimensional case we must require that [formula] for some k.

In proposition [\ref=DelPezzo3] we can't change D on [formula]. Let us show it in the following two examples.

(1) Let [formula] be a Du Val singularity of type [formula] defined by a polynomial x21 + x22x3 + xn - 13, where n  ≥  4. The pair (X,H) is not lc for any hyperplane section H. If n  ≥  5 then one of the coefficients of [formula] is not less then 2 / 3 and all coefficients of D are equal to 1 / 2. This singularity is not exceptional by the definition since [formula] is 2-complement (see also example [\cite=Kud3]).

(2) Let [formula] be a canonical singularity defined by a polynomial t3 + z2x + x4 + xy5. The pair (X,H) is not lc for any hyperplane section H. The variety X has cA2 singularity along the curve [formula] (outside 0). The divisor T = {t = x = 0} on X is [formula]-Cartier since 3T  ~  {x = 0}. Therefore the divisor [formula] is klt. Thus (X,0) is not weakly exceptional singularity [\cite=Pr2].

Now consider (40,45,30,18)-blow-up of [formula]. It induces a plt blow-up of (X,0). Then [formula], where li are the straight lines in general position. The divisor [formula] is klt 6-complement of minimal index. Since the divisor [formula] is anti-ample and non-klt then by criterion [\cite=Kud2] (X,0) is not weakly exceptional singularity again. In this example all coefficients of D are not more then [formula].

It is very interesting to compare the following example [\ref=exam2] with the previous example [\ref=exam1](2).

Let [formula] be a canonical singularity defined by a polynomial t3 + z2x + tx3 + ty5. The variety X has cA1 singularity along the curve [formula] (outside 0). Consider the divisor T = {t = z = 0} on X. If T had been [formula]-Cartier divisor then the divisor [formula] would have been klt and consequently (X,0) would have been not weakly exceptional singularity. Now we prove that T is not [formula]-Cartier divisor and (X,0) is an exceptional singularity.

Consider [formula]-blow-up of [formula]. It induces a plt blow-up [formula]. Then [formula], [formula]. In the next picture we illustrate the situation of these curves and the singularities of surface E.

Assume that T is [formula]-Cartier divisor. Then [formula] is anti-ample divisor over X since a > 0. Hence [formula] is anti-ample divisor. It is not true since [formula]. Here {z = 0} and {y = 0} are denoted the corresponding divisors on [formula].

The divisor [formula] is 5-complement of minimal index. It is easy to show that there is only the following 6-complement [formula] among 1,2,3,4 and 6-complements. It is clear that this divisor is klt. Therefore (X,0) is an exceptional singularity.

Finally let us consider one more example showing the investigation process of given singularities on the exceptionality.

Let [formula] be a canonical singularity defined by a polynomial f = t2x + z3x + zx2y + atz2y + bz2y3 + cxy4. Consider [formula]-blow-up of [formula]. Then [formula], where Δ3  =  {z = x = 0} and Υ4  =  {x = y = 0}. Let us prove that the divisor [formula] is non-klt 4-complement if c = 0 (then b  ≠  0). It implies that (X,0) is not exceptional singularity if c = 0. Since the klt and lc properties of pair remain true by the finite dominant morphisms then it is enough to prove that [formula] is lc, but not klt pair, where [formula] and T = {z = 0}|Z. Note that (Z,0) is the singularity of type [formula]. The blow-up of [formula] with the weights (3,4,2) induces a blow-up [formula]. Besides [formula]. The exceptional divisor C is not well-formed hypersurface [formula]. The divisor [formula] is klt. By Inversion of Adjunction we complete the proof. If c  ≠  0 then by the same argument one can prove that (X,0) is an exceptional singularity.

Classification of three-dimensional exceptional not well-formed singularities

The comments to the tables. All agreements of [\cite=Kud3] about the notations and records in the tables remain valid. The underlying monomials (see point (I) of [\cite=Kud3]) are written without the coefficients before them.

If log Del Pezzo surface [formula] is a linear cone, i.e. [formula] for some k then we write the simplified form of E

[formula]

For the record of different [formula] one use the following notations. The curves Ci', where [formula] (see proposition [\ref=diff]) are denoted by Γ, Δ, Υ, Ω respectively. The curves {t = z = 0}, {t = x = 0}, {t = y = 0}, {z = x = 0}, {z = y = 0}, {x = y = 0} are denoted by Γ2, Γ3, Γ4, Δ3, Δ4, Υ4 respectively.

If there is a symbol * in the description of different cases then this marked case has the other different. Then the different differs by the addition of other curve marked by * or the different is completely another one marked by * also.
