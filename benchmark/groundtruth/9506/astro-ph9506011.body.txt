The measurement by COBE [\cite=cobe1] of the large angle anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation has determined the magnitude of primordial density fluctuations at very large scales. This has ruled out the simple cold dark matter (CDM) scenario of structure formation [\cite=cdm], since with the power on large scales fixed as measured by COBE and with the assumption of a scale free primordial fluctuations spectrum the model leads to approximately twice more power at galactic and cluster scales than observed. If one wants to describe structure formation in a model with a flat primordial fluctuation spectrum one has to assume that the onset of matter dominance (MD) took place later than in a simple CDM model. This can be achieved e.g. in an open universe with h2Ω  ≈  0.2, where h  =  H / (100km / sec / Mpc) and Ω  =  ρ  /  ρc. This model is disfavored by inflationary scenarios which (at least in simple versions) predict Ω  =  1. Another possibility is the mixed (hot+cold) dark matter scenario [\cite=cdm] with ΩCDM≃0.7 and ΩHDM≃0.3. One can also get a flat universe with Ωtot  =  1 and low matter density if the cosmological constant Λ is nonzero. Such models also give a satisfactory description of the observed structure [\cite=lam].

The common shortcoming of these models is that they all demand a certain amount of fine tuning. For example, one would generally expect that the contribution from hot and cold dark matter to differ by many orders of magnitude.

Recently there appeared a renewed interest [\cite=ma1] to the idea of structure formation with unstable particles [\cite=GSV]. The recent models assume that there exists a massive long-lived particle, usually the tau neutrino with mass in the MeV range, decaying into massless species at the epoch when the mass density of the parent particles dominates the energy density of the universe. Correspondingly, the present-day energy density of relativistic particles is bigger than in the standard scenario and the onset of the MD stage takes place later. All these models have so far been based on the assumption of two unrelated components. A possible exception might be the models with non-zero Λ if a consistent adjustment mechanism is found which, as argued in ref. [\cite=ad1], leads generically to an noncompensated amount of vacuum energy of order m2Pl  /  t2.

In this letter we will consider a model for the unstable particle scenario in which both the unstable particles and the particles of cold (or possibly warm) dark matter are closely inter-connected. In fact, the decay of the former produces particles of the present-day dark matter.

A necessary background model of this kind in particle physics was proposed some time ago in an attempt to find a phenomenologically acceptable way to spontaneously break R parity in supersymmetric extensions of the standard [formula] model [\cite=MASI_pot3]. The breaking of R parity occurs around the electroweak scale and implies the violation of lepton number [\cite=CMP]. Moreover, in the simplest realization adopted in ref. [\cite=MASI_pot3] lepton number is violated only through R parity violating interactions. As a result, the magnitude of the R parity violating effects is related to the large Majorana type mass of the tau neutrino, which could easily reach the MeV range. As shown in ref. [\cite=RPMSW] the is unstable and decays into the light plus a majoron J [\cite=fae]. A possible breaking of global symmetries by gravity would give a nonzero mass to the corresponding (pseudo) goldstone boson [\cite=Goran]. In this context it has been suggested that the majoron may pick up a mass of the order KeV, which is in the right range for it to play the role of cold dark matter particle [\cite=Venya].

We assume that the values of mass and lifetime of are such that there existed a period when it dominated the cosmological energy density. We denote the corresponding red-shift when it started as z1. Another interesting moment was when the tau neutrino decayed and the universe returned to an RD stage. The corresponding red-shift is zd. And at last there is the moment, which is especially important for structure formation, when the contemporary MD stage started. The onset of this stage was at red-shift z2. The red-shift z1 is determined by the equality of energy densities of relativistic, ρrel, and nonrelativistic, ρm, matter:

[formula]

Here mM  =  mντ  /  , rν is the ratio of ντ number density to that of normal massless neutrinos, and ξ  =  TJ  /  Tγ. For light (m < 3 MeV) ξ  ≈  1 and for heavy (m > 10 MeV) ξ  ≈  (4 / 11)1 / 3. The value of the photon temperature at this moment is T1≃69mMrν(1 + 0.34ξ4)- 1. This result is valid if T1 is larger than the majoron mass mJ. We assume here that this is true. The other two interesting red-shifts are given by

[formula]

[formula]

The upper bound on the universe age does not permit neutrinos to have mass above a few tens eV or, in the case of nonzero cosmological constant, a few hundreds eV [\cite=zsk]. This bound can be avoided only if the is unstable or has annihilation cross section considerably larger than in the standard model. In fact in the scenario we consider here both ingredients are present, so that neutrino masses in the MeV region are cosmologically allowed. The successful prediction for the nucleosynthesis of light elements forbids Majorana tau neutrino masses in the range 0.5  <  mM  <  35 if the latter has the standard weak annihilation cross section and is stable on the nucleosynthesis time scale i.e τ  >  100 sec [\cite=ktcs] [\cite=BBNUTAU]. In our case, however, this bound can be avoided because ντ has a rather strong diagonal Yukawa coupling to majorons,

[formula]

In many majoron models g  =  mν / V where V is the scale at which spontaneous lepton number violation occurs which is, by assumption, the weak scale, so that g  =  10- 5mM  /  (V / 100  ). In order to suppress rν sufficiently so that the massive ντ would not distort the nucleosynthesis predictions on the one hand, and sufficiently large for a noticeable delay of the onset of the last MD stage on the other, we need g slightly above 10- 4. This value fits nicely with the assumption that the mass lies in the MeV range. It is also surprisingly close to the values assumed in the spontaneously broken R parity model [\cite=RPMSW]. For such g values annihilations into majorons substantially reduces the ντ number density during nucleosynthesis and after .

Another useful restriction follows from the bound on the total energy density in the universe. For any form of matter we have an upper bound: ρx  <  ρtot  =  10.5Ωh2. Applying this bound to the massive majorons gives rJ  <  0.1Ωh2 / mK where mK is the majoron mass in KeV and rJ  =  nJ  /  n0, where nJ is the majoron number density and n0 is the number density of normal massless neutrinos, n0  =  0.18T3ν. The majorons in our model are produced in the early universe either thermally or possibly by the lepton number violation phase transition. In addition, they can be produced as a result of ντ decay at a relatively late stage. For the latter rdecayJ  =  rν and for the former one should naively expect rthermJ  =  (1 / 2)(4 / 3)  =  2 / 3. If this is true the majoron mass should be too small to be interesting for the process of structure formation, since the characteristic scale of the structures to form first would be too large, as in the hot neutrino scenario. However, it is important to note that the majorons are rather strongly self-coupled particles, as they possess an interaction λJ4 whose coupling constant λ could be as large as 10- 2. This interaction in the second order leads to the process of cannibalism, when collisions of four J's produce only two. The freeze-out of species whose number density was reduced by multiparticle collisions n  →  2 was considered in refs. [\cite=dadth] [\cite=cmh] in a simplified approach. Here we have numerically integrated the kinetic equation governing this process, under the usual assumptions that majorons are in kinetic equilibrium and described by Boltzman statistics. Then in complete analogy to two-body annihilation (see e.g. [\cite=gg]) we get

[formula]

where N is the combinatorial factor related to identical J's (we take N = 2), K1 is the McDonalds (Bessel) function, rR  =  nJ  /  n0, reqJ  =  neqJ  /  n0, where neqJ is the equilibrium number density of majorons given by the Boltzman distribution with temperature TJ.

It is a rather tedious job to calculate the cross section of the process 4J  →  2J but, since there is considerable freedom in the choice of the value of λ which is not known anyhow, we make a simple estimate of the cross section σ(s) assuming that the amplitude of the process is a constant, A  =  λ2 / m2J. Since the photon temperature of is not equal to the temperature of the majorons, we need another equation which is provided by the covariant law of majoron energy density conservation.

In our numerical estimates we have assumed the following parameter values: rνmM  =  10- 2, mM  =  10, τν  =  5 yr., and Ωh2  =  0.5. These numerical values are only illustrative, we use them as a reference set in order to show that the model can be self-consistent. With these numbers we get T1  ≈  630 eV, Td  ≈  50 eV, and T2  ≈  0.45 eV. The frozen number density of majorons is found to be sufficiently small, rJ  ≈  0.2. We assume that the majoron mass is mK  =  0.3. Correspondingly the characteristic size of the structures first formed can be two orders of magnitude smaller than in the neutrino universe, i.e. M = a few [formula].

Some bounds on the properties of MeV tau neutrinos and majorons can be found from astrophysics. In order to avoid excessive stellar cooling through majoron emission their mean free path inside a star (lfreeJ) should be smaller than the radius of the latter. For a supernova with temperature T  ≈  10 MeV the latter is lfreeJ  =  1 / σnν  =  1010(10- 5 / g)4cm. For g  >  10- 4 we are safe. Another possible restriction arises from the observed neutrino flux from SN87A. There could be delayed neutrinos originated from the decay ντ  →  J + ν [\cite=Soares]. But, for example, in the model of ref. [\cite=MASI_pot3] the main decay channel is into so that this restriction is also harmless.

By assumption the majoron arises from the spontaneous violation of the global U(1) lepton number symmetry which generates the neutrino masses. For masses in the MeV range the majoron has a sizeable diagonal Yukawa coupling to the of order g = 10- 4. The majoron also has a much weaker nondiagonal coupling to muon neutrinos which induces the decay ντ  →  νμ  +  J with lifetime of order of years. In order to avoid the supernova bound we assume the nondiagonal coupling to to be negligible. Moreover the diagonal couplings of the majoron to and are severely restricted in order to ensure that the majoron decay lifetime J  →  νν is larger than the age of the universe, i.e. [formula]. Using the estimate mν  =  gννV and a typical value for the lepton number violation scale around 103 GeV we obtain that the and masses will be around 10- 5 eV, i.e., just the range where the solar deficit will be explained by long wavelength or just-so to oscillations.

Moreover, our unstable dark matter majoron will have tiny loop-induced decays to two photons J  →  γγ which will lead to the existence of an X-ray line at Eγ  =  mJ / 2 which could be detectable [\cite=Venya].

The self-coupling λJ4 between majorons with λ in the range from 10- 2 to 10- 4 leads to an interaction cross section σel  =  λ2 / (64πm2J) which will maintain kinetic equilibrium between majorons till the present day. The corresponding majoron mean free path lfree = (σelnJ)- 1 with nJ  =  ncosm  =  10Ωh2m- 1K  /  3 is about 100 Kpc(mK  /  λ23) where mK  =  mJ  /   and λ3  =  103λ. Inside galaxies with nJ  =  3  ×  104- 3m- 1K this mean free path is much smaller than the galactic size, lfree  =  7(mK  /  λ23) pc.

The possibility that dark matter can have a relatively strong self-interaction, while being essentially decoupled from usual matter, has been considered earlier [\cite=cmh] [\cite=m]. The behaviour of such matter is intermediate between that found in the CDM and HDM models. Structure formation with self-interacting dark matter particles has been recently criticized [\cite=lss]. Our scheme however is different from the simple original version and avoids at least some of these criticisms. The main objection of ref. [\cite=lss] is that it is impossible to generate enough small scale power to account for the damped Lyα systems without producing too much power at cluster scales. Any model with decaying particles and early MD stage, such as ours, automatically takes care of this, since it has a suppressed power at cluster scales and simultaneously a large power on smaller scales due to rising fluctuations at the earlier MD stage. Another point raised in ref [\cite=lss] is that the galaxy merging should be quite different from what is expected in the usual collisionless dark matter case, and that the motion of galaxies with respect to the cosmic background would result in the stripping of the dark matter halos from galaxies. However, these points deserve further investigation. For example, the stripping of the halos may not take place if all the dark matter is clustered inside the halos and the cosmological background is absent. Present data show that the galactic halos extend up to two or more hundred kiloparsecs, and the 100% clustering at a large scale could account for Ω  ≈  1. Note also that the process of clustering of self-interacting matter differs from that of collisionless or baryonic matter because the former does not loose energy so easily by radiating photons.

The self-interacting dark matter would form an isothermal matter distribution in the halos, and since the self-gravitating isothermal gas has a mass density which goes down with distance as 1 / r2, it gives a natural explanation of the observed flat rotational curves. It was recently noted [\cite=rotcur] that the shape of the rotation curves inside or not far from the luminous center (for dwarves and also possibly for spirals) does not agree with the assumption of the collisionless dark matter. While this statement depends on how matter is distributed in galaxies, if confirmed, it may be a strong argument in favor of self-interacting dark matter. Another test of the model (suggested to us by S. White) is the shape of the halo: for self-interacting dark matter it should be more spherical than for the sterile one.

Last but not least, the scenario described here can be implemented rather naturally in majoron extensions of the standard model of particle physics. As an example, supersymmetry with spontaneously broken R parity provides a consistent model for our scenario which incorporates all the necessary ingredients.
