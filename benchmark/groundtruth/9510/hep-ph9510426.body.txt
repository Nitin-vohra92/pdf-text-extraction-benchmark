plus 0.2pt minus 0.1pt Recently, it has become clear that certain aspects of four dimensional supersymmetric field theories can be analyzed exactly [\cite=duality] [\cite=holomorphy] [\cite=both] [\cite=DSB]. By using the innovation, it has been tried to build models in order to solve some phenomenological problems [\cite=DSB] [\cite=mike] [\cite=IzaYana] [\cite=Stras]. One of the most interesting aspects is "duality" [\cite=duality] [\cite=both]. By using "duality", we can infer the low energy effective theory of a strong coupling gauge theory. One of the authors suggested that nature may use this "duality". He discussed a duality of a Supersymmetric Standard Model(SSM). But unfortunately, his model does not have Yukawa couplings of the lepton sector. In this paper, we would like to discuss a duality of a supersymmetric(SUSY) model with Pati-Salam gauge group [\cite=PatiSalam] in order to obtain all Yukawa couplings.

First we would like to review Seiberg's duality. Following his discussion [\cite=duality], we examine SU(NC) SUSY QCD with NF flavors of chiral superfields,

which has the global symmetry SU(NF)L  ×  SU(NF)R  ×  U(1)B  ×  U(1)R. In the following, we would like to take NF  ≥  NC + 2, though in the case NF  ≤  NC + 1 there are a lot of interesting features [\cite=both] [\cite=ADS] [\cite=AKMRV] [\cite=NSVZ]. Seiberg suggests [\cite=duality] that in the case NF  ≥  NC + 2 at the low energy scale the above theory is equivalent to the following SU(ÑC) SUSY QCD theory (ÑC = NF - NC) with NF flavors of chiral superfields qi and j and meson fields Tij,

and with a superpotential

[formula]

The above two theories satisfy the 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions [\cite=tHooft]. Moreover Seiberg showed that they are consistent with the decoupling theorem [\cite=decoupling]. Namely, if we introduce a mass term only for superfields QNF and NF

[formula]

in the original theory, the dual theory has vacuum expectation value(VEVs) [formula] and SU(Nf - Nc) is broken to SU(Nf - Nc - 1), which is consistent with the decoupling of the heavy quark in the original theory.

Second, we would like to review a duality of a SUSY Standard Model(SSM) [\cite=mike]. We introduce ordinary matter superfields

[formula]

which transform under the gauge group [formula]. There are no Higgs superfields. We would like to examine the dual theory of this theory with respect to the gauge group [formula]. In the following, we neglect the lepton sector for simplicity. Since NF = 6, the dual gauge group is also SU(3)C ( ÑC = NF - NC ), which we would like to assign to the QCD gauge group. A subgroup, SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y, of the global symmetry group SU(6)L  ×  SU(6)R  ×  U(1)B  ×  U(1)R is gauged. When we assign Q = (U1L,D1L,U2L,D2L,U3L,D3L) and  = (Uc1R,Dc1R,Uc2R,Dc2R,Uc3R,Dc3R), the SU(2)L generators are given by

[formula]

where IaLi are generators of SU(2)Li symmetries which rotate (UiL,DiL), and the generator of hypercharge Y is given by

[formula]

where IaRi are generators of SU(2)Ri symmetries which rotate (UcRi,DcRi). In this theory, the global symmetry group is SU(3)QL  ×  SU(3)UR  ×  SU(3)DR  ×  U(1)B  ×  U(1)R. Then we can write down the quantum numbers of dual fields;

[formula]

under the standard gauge group SU(3)C  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y. Here Mij  ~  QiLUcRj and Nij  ~  QiLDcRj are the meson fields and we assign q = (d1L, - u1L,d2L, - u2L,d3L, - u3L) and  = (dc1R, - uc1R,dc2R, - uc2R,dc3R, - uc3R). It is interesting that the matter contents of both theories are almost the same. The difference is the existence of nine pairs of Higgs superfields Mij and Nij and their Yukawa terms coupling to ordinary matter superfields,

[formula]

It is interesting that the Yukawa couplings can be expected to be of order 1 because of the strong dynamics. This means that at least one quark has a heavy mass, which is almost the order of the weak scale v. It is also interesting that the SUSY mass terms of Higgs particles are forbidden by the global symmetry SU(3)Q  ×  SU(3)UR  ×  SU(3)DR.

Unfortunately, the model has a lot of phenomenological problems. There is no Yukawa coupling of leptons, there appear Nambu-Goldstone bosons when the Higgs particles have vacuum expectation values, and the SUSY mass terms of Higgs particles vanish. Moreover we may give up the success of the unification of the three gauge couplings, because we cannot trace the running of the [formula] coupling.

In the following, we try to avoid the problem of Yukawa couplings of leptons and of the Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Why does not the above model have Yukawa couplings of leptons? This is because the leptons have no color charge. Therefore, we can expect that if we adopt the Pati-Salam gauge group SU(4)PS as the dual gauge group, the model has the Yukawa couplings of leptons.

We consider the dual gauge group of SU(4)PS. The model which is extended minimally from MSSM has six flavors because a color triplet and a singlet belong to a quartet of SU(4)PS. In this case, the dual group is SU(2), and it is necessary to treat the model differently, since the model satisfies NF = 3NC and is no longer in a non-abelian coulomb phase. The gauge coupling may not become strong. Therefore, we investigate another possibility of realizing SU(4)PS. If we introduce fourth generation, we should impose some unnatural mass relations in order to suppress the Peskin-Takeuchi's S and T parameters [\cite=PeskinTake]. Therefore, we would like to add one vector-like generation. Since NF becomes ten, the dual gauge group of the SU(4)PS becomes SU(6). Here we introduce the following superfields:

[formula]

under the gauge group SU(6)HC  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R. Since NF = 10 under the gauge group SU(6)HC, the dual gauge group becomes SU(4)PS  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R. Then the dual fields become

[formula]

which transform under the gauge group SU(4)PS  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R, and have the superpotential

[formula]

Namely this model has three generations and one vector-like generation with the Pati-Salam gauge group. You should notice that the Yukawa couplings of leptons appear. If we introduce soft SUSY breaking terms

[formula]

in the original theory, all the global symmetries [formula] except U(1)B + L can be broken explicitly. Therefore, we can avoid the massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons.

Here we only assume that the above duality can be realized even with the SUSY breaking terms. We can obtain the SUSY breaking terms of the dual theory,

[formula]

where we treat SUSY breaking parameters perturbatively [\cite=Peskin] and μ denotes a typical scale of the dual dynamics. The scale μ should be larger than the SUSY breaking scale for the perturbation to be good approximation. From the above SUSY breaking terms, we can find that the scalar fields N(1)i and M(1)i have vacuum expectation values(VEVs) of order μ. Therefore, under the scale μ we will get the three family model with the Pati-Salam gauge group.

In this scenario, however, the Pati-Salam scale should be around the SUSY breaking scale because of the following two reasons. The first reason is that there is no vacuum which can break the gauge symmetry SU(4)PS  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R to the standard gauge group SU(3)C  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y in the flat direction. Namely, the Pati-Salam scale should be the order of the SUSY breaking scale for the potential problem. The second reason is that the Yukawa couplings of leptons become too small if the Pati-Salam scale is much larger than the weak scale. Namely since under the Pati-Salam scale, "leptons" in ψiL become massive with T4i and ordinary leptons become three linear combinations of Tij, the Yukawa couplings of the lepton sector become very small.

It seems to be impossible for such a lower Pati-Salam scale to be consistent with the experimental bounds. From the bound [\cite=data] Γ(K0L  →  eμ) / ΓK0L < 3.3  ×  10- 11, the Pati-Salam scale is usually estimated to be larger than 1400 TeV [\cite=ValWil]. However in the scenario where the τ lepton is associated with the down quark, the lower bound of the Pati-Salam scale becomes 13 TeV [\cite=ValWil], which is not so far from the weak scale as 1400 TeV. Therefore, if the SUSY breaking scale is of order 10 TeV, we may satisfy the above experimental constraint. Though such a large SUSY breaking scale is unnatural, it can suppress flavor changing neutral currents. In future the signal of B0S  →  μe may be found [\cite=ValWil].

Though the structure of quark and lepton mass matrices are too complicated for us to analyze them, we should comment about the masses of neutrinos. In this model, two right-handed neutrinos have Majorana masses, which are order of the Pati-Salam scale, as a result of their mixing with gauginos( you should notice that the SUSY breaking scale is also of order the Pati-Salam scale ). Therefore, two left-handed neutrinos become light by seesaw mechanism. However, since one left-handed neutrino cannot use the seesaw mechanism, the Dirac masses of the left-handed neutrino should be less than of order 30 MeV, which is the experimental upper bound of the tau neutrino mass. In this case, other two neutrinos will be lighter than (10MeV)2 / (10TeV)  ~   10 eV.

In summary, we examine duality of a SUSY model with the Pati-Salam gauge group. In this model, the Yukawa couplings of the lepton sector as well as of the quark sector can be induced. Since the Pati-Salam scale should be around SUSY breaking scale in this model, we should take the SUSY breaking scale larger than 10 TeV. The signal B0S  →  μe may be found in future experiments.
