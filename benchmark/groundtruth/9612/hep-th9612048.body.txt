Integrable models in more than two independent variables are of interest [\cite=AC]. One class of such models is the generalized Loewner systems introduced by Konopelchenko and Rogers [\cite=KR1] [\cite=KR2]. These are third order partial differential equations which are first order in z which is to be the temporal variable. These equations are studied using sophisticated methods such as Lie-Bäcklund transformation [\cite=KSR], [formula] dressing method [\cite=KR2] [\cite=DK], and Painlevé analysis [\cite=RL].

In the following we consider the three dimensional generalizations of the sine-Gordon and Toda model as introduced in [\cite=KR2]. The observation is that a large class of solutions to these partial differential equations and an important property of these equations can be obtained by a very simple and elementary method.

We begin with the so called three dimensional sine-Gordon equation [\cite=KR2] which reads as

[formula]

where a subscript means partial differentiation. We use the following ansatz.

[formula]

This makes the last term in [\ref=1] identically vanish and equation [\ref=1] becomes

[formula]

From this it follows that equation [\ref=1] has two solutions as follows: A: θ(x,y,z)  =  f(u(x,y),z) for u(x,y)  =  g(x + y)  +  h(x - y), where g and h are two arbitrary functions and f is a solution to the two dimensional sine-Gordon eqaution fuz  =  c sin f in lightcone coordinates. Here c is a constant. B: θ(x,y,z)  =  f(x  ±  y,z) for any arbitrary function f of two variabales.

We use these results to get some information about this partial differential equation. Consider a function h(z) which is smooth and has the following properties. h(z)  =  0 for z  ≤  z0 where z0  >  0; and h(z)  ≠  0 for z  >  z0. Now, the function θ(x,y,z)  =  f(x  ±  y)h(z) for an arbitrary f has the following properties: 1) θ is a solution to [\ref=1], and 2) θ(x,y,z) = 0 for z  ≤  0. This shows that the solution to the initial value problem for equation [\ref=1] is not unique.

This non- uniqnueness makes it unpleasant as an evolution equation. This is not surprising, for z is not 'time'. z is something like one of the light cone (characteristic) variables. To get an idea of what is happening consider the wave equation in light cone coordinates. The equation θuz = 0 has the known solution θ(u,z)  =  f(u)  +  g(z), where f and g are two arbitrary functions. Now the 'initial' value problem θ(u,0)  =  f(u) has infinite solutions: Any function g(z) such that g(0) = 0 gives a solution θ(u,z)  =  f(u)  +  g(z). In other words, specifying the value of θ on a lightlike line does not lead to a unique solution; one has to specify the value of θ, considered as a fuction of (t,x) = (u - z,u + z), and its first temporal derivative on a spacelike line to get a unique solution. Therefore, the argument preceding this paragraph shows that equation [\ref=1] is not a good evolution equation in the sense that z is not a temporal variable.

The non-uniqueness of the solution to the initial value problem of equation [\ref=1] can also be seen from type A solutions as follows. The sine-Gordon equation fuz  =   sin f has the following solution

[formula]

where α is a non-zero real parameter. Take a function u(x,y) which is a solution to the wave equation and construct the following two solutions to equation [\ref=1]

[formula]

[formula]

These two solutions agree at z = 0 but disagree at z  ≠  0.

Now we turn to the three dimensional generalization of the Toda model which is given by a 2  ×  2 Cartan matrix Kαβ. The same ansatz leads to solutions for this model. The differential equatin is

[formula]

Here α is an index while subscripts x, y, and z denote partial differentiation as usual . Now we use the following ansatz:

[formula]

Equation [\ref=5], then, becomes

[formula]

From this it is evident that equation [\ref=5] has the following two solutions: A: ψα(x,y,z)  =  fα(u(x,y),z) where u(x,y) = g(x  +  σ- 1y)  +  h(x  -  σ- 1y) for two arbitrary functions g and h provided that fα(u,z) are solutions to the two dimensional Toda equation [formula]. Here c is a constant. B: ψα(x,y,z)  =  fα(x  ±  σ- 1y,z) for arbitrary functions fα of two variables.

We conclude this letter by the following remarks. 1. On setting σ = 0 in [\ref=5] we get a third order partial differential equation in two variables x and z, which after a first integration leads to [formula], where c is an arbitrary function of z. By redefining z, c can be considered as a constant. This is the familiar two dimensional Toda model. Therefore, it must be true that the σ  →  0 limit of solutions A and B lead to solutions of the two dimensional model. In doing so one must be careful because the wave equation uxx  -  σ2uyy = 0 in that limit leads to u = ax  +  c, for two constants a and c. In fact, c may be a function of y but this dependence is not relevant. Therefore, type A solutions actually become the solutions of the two dimensional model. For type B solutions, we note that the limit of u2x  -  σ2u2y = 0 as σ  →  0 leads to u = constant. Now, a glance at 8 shows that type B solutions, in this limit, read as ψα(x,y,z) = fα(z) for arbitrary fα which is trivially a solution of 7. This shows that type B solutions are peculiar to the third order equation 7. 2. Setting σ2  →    -  σ2 in [\ref=5] leads to a three dimensional model which has solutions of type A for any harmonic function u(x,y). Solutions of type B disappear. The same is true for the three dimensional sine-Gordon equation: On changing the sign of the second term in equation [\ref=1], one gets the following partial differential equation which has solutions of type A if u(x,y) is a harmonic function and f is a solution of the two dimensional sine-Gordon equation.

[formula]

This partial differential equation has SO(2) symmetry in the (x,y) variables while equation [\ref=1] has SO(1,1) symmetry, as is shown in [\cite=KR2]. The non-uniqueness of the initial value problem remains intact, therefore, these Euclidean versions are not evolution equations either.
