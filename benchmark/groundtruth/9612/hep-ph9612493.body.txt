Introduction

The popularity of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) in recent years is mainly due to its success in attaining gauge coupling unification: given the particle content of the MSSM, the three coupling constants of the SU(3)C  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y gauge groups converge to a common value at a common scale (the GUT scale) when evolved up to higher energies using the renormalization group equations (RGE) [\cite=AMALDI:91]. This unification of the gauge coupling constants is crucial if one wishes to construct a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) which unifies the three gauge groups of the Standard Model (SM) into a larger simple group at a single scale. However, it should be noted that the particle content which achieves such unification is not unique [\cite=HALL:91]. In particular, as pointed out in Ref. [\cite=IBANEZ:81], one always has the freedom to add complete generations of matter superfields to the MSSM without destroying the unification condition.

Another attractive feature of the MSSM is the possibility of unifying the b and τ Yukawa couplings: if one assumes

[formula]

at the GUT scale, then one finds that the MSSM can reproduce the experimental value of Rbτ(MZ)  =  Yb(MZ) / Yτ(MZ)  ≈  1.8 if the Yukawa couplings of the top and the bottom were such that [formula] ([formula]), or [formula] ([formula]). [\cite=LANGACKER:94]

The reason why the experimental value of Rbτ can only be reproduced for either small or large tan β is easy to understand: QCD interactions will enhance Yb(μ) over Yτ(μ) as they are evolved down from [formula] to MZ so that Rbτ(MZ) will end up well above the experimental value if only running due to gauge interactions were taken into account. This QCD effect must be countered by strong Yukawa interactions which will slow down the running. A smaller value of Rbτ consistent with experiment can be obtained when Yt is large enough to counter the QCD enhancement alone, or when both Yt and Yb are large so that the two of them combined can have the desired effect. In the intermediate tan β region ([formula]) Yt is not large enough to sufficiently suppress the increase of Rbτ by itself while Yb is not large enough to compensate for it.

Of these two solutions, the small tan β case is often considered particularly attractive since the large size of [formula] will drive Yt(μ) rapidly towards an infrared quasi-fixed point [\cite=HILL:81] as it is evolved down in scale. As a result, the value of Yt(MZ) is highly insensitive to its initial value [formula] at the GUT scale. On the other hand, the large tan β case opens the possibility of unifying the top Yukawa coupling with the other two:

[formula]

as required in SO(10) unification with a [formula]-Higgs. However, the insensitivity to the initial condition at [formula] is lost.

In this paper, we wish to outline how these conclusions will be modified when the MSSM is extended with an addition of a generation-mirror generation pair of extra matter superfields. (the 4th and [formula]th generations). Each generation is assumed to consist of the usual 15 chiral fermion fields plus their superpartners. We will ignore the right-handed neutrino necessary to form the [formula] representation of SO(10) since we will always assume it to have a superheavy Majorana mass and make it decouple from the RGE's. Due to the mirror quantum number assignments between the 4th and [formula]th generation fermions, they can develop SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y invariant masses enabling the left-handed neutrino to have a heavy Dirac mass thus circumventing the LEP limit for the number of massless neutrinos. Also, radiative corrections to LEP observables from the extra fermions can be made to decouple by making this gauge invariant mass large.[\cite=MAEKAWA:95]

One immediate consequence of the presence of the 2 extra generations is that all three gauge couplings of SU(3)C  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y will be asymptotically non-free: they will become larger as they are evolved up to coincide at the unification scale [\cite=THEISEN:88]. This property is actually unique to the 5 generation model. In models with 4 generations or less, the QCD coupling will stay asymptotically free, and in models with 6 generations or more the couplings will diverge before unification.

As shown in the appendix, the unification of gauge couplings is controlled solely by the differences of the beta function coefficients in the one-loop approximation. Since the differences of the coefficients are independent of the number of full generations, the gauge coupling unification in our 5 generation model works well just as in the MSSM.

However, an important difference between asymptotically free theories and asymptotically non-free theories is that α  =  0 is an ultraviolet (UV) fixed point in the former but an infrared (IR) fixed point in the latter. This means that for asymptotically free (non-free) theories, the RG flow will be such that a large region of α values in the IR (UV) will flow into a small region close to α = 0 in the UV (IR), and the difference in the relative size of these regions will be more pronounced for larger separations in scale. Therefore, in order to get the desired value of α(MZ) in asymptotically free theories, the value of [formula] must be tuned to extreme accuracy while for asymptotically non-free theories, no fine tuning is necessary. This is shown schematically in Fig. [\ref=fig0].

This absence of the necessity to fine tune parameters at the UV cutoff is an extremely attractive feature of asymptotically non-free theories. It means that the high energy theory effective above the UV cutoff can give the correct predictions at low energies as long as it predicts the values of the running couplings at the cutoff to be within an only mildly restricted range. This point has been emphasized previously by many authors [\cite=PARISI:75] (though not necessarily from a modern point of view). In particular, Moroi, Murayama and Yanagida [\cite=MOROI:93] have studied the same 5 generation model as we are considering here and have shown that the values of the running couplings at [formula] need not even be unified to predict the correct value of sin 2θw.

In this paper, we extend the analysis of Moroi et al. and study how the existence of the extra generations will affect the running of the Yukawa couplings of the 3rd generation fermions. A similar problem for the non-supersymetric case has been considered in [\cite=GRUN:88]. As in the MSSM case, we will impose a unification condition on the Yukawa couplings at [formula] and determine the parameter range in which our model can predict the correct top, bottom and τ-lepton masses.

The attentive reader at this point may think that such a program is doomed to failure from the beginning. Since the QCD coupling is asymptotically non-free, the QCD enhancement of Rbτ from [formula] to MZ will be even larger than the MSSM case making it impossible to bring Rbτ(MZ) down to ~  1.8 even with large Yukawa couplings. However, we would like to quickly point out that the unification condition need not be that of Eqs. ([\ref=UNI1]) or ([\ref=UNI2]). In fact, an SO(10)-GUT with an [formula]-Higgs predicts [\cite=CHANOWITZ:77]

[formula]

so that [formula]. This is the unification condition which we will adopt. In this case, the extra enhancement from QCD is actually welcome since Rbτ must be enhanced by a factor of 5  ~  6 to reproduce the experimental value of Rbτ(MZ).

This paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we describe our model and specify the way we calculate the RG evolution of the gauge and Yukawa couplings. In section 3, we show how the gauge couplings can be unified in our model. Section 4 discusses Yukawa coupling unification and the predictions for Rbτ(MZ) and mt. Section 5 concludes.

The 4 +  Generation Model:

In extending the MSSM by introducing extra matter superfields, we must keep two things in mind: (1) the matter superfields must be introduced in such a way that gauge coupling unification (and anomaly cancellation) of the MSSM is preserved, and (2) the fermion content must be compatible with the constraints placed by LEP measurements, namely three massless neutrino species and the so-called Peskin-Takeuchi constraint [\cite=PESKIN:90].

The simplest way to satisfy these requirements is to introduce 2 extra generations which form a generation-mirror generation pair. We will call them the 4th and anti-4th generations. The fermion content of these extra generations will be 'vector-like' so that all of them, including the extra neutrinos, can develop SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y invariant Dirac masses. These masses will also suppress the size of radiative corrections to LEP observables from the extra fermions enabling them to circumvent the Peskin-Takeuchi constraint[\cite=MAEKAWA:95].

It should be noted that we can only introduce one such generation-mirror generation pair. If we introduce two pairs or more, all three gauge couplings will reach their Landau poles and diverge well before the would-have-been unification scale[\cite=MOROI:93].

We denote the extra fermion families (U,D,N,E) and (Ū,,N̄,Ē), respectively, and give them a common SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y invariant mass of [formula]. Their superpartners, and all the other supersymmetric particles in the theory will be given a common SUSY breaking mass of [formula]. For the sake of simplicity, we take [formula].

In addition to the SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y invariant masses, we also couple the 4th and [formula]th generation fermions to the two Higgs doublets in the same way as the other generations. Here we take the case where

[formula]

and set all the 1st and 2nd generation Yukawa couplings to zero. Furthermore, we impose the unification condition

[formula]

as mentioned in the introduction.

In view of the relatively large coupling strengths near the unification scale due to the asymptotically non-freeness, we use the fully coupled 2-loop renormalization group equations (RGE's) from Ref. [\cite=RGE:2LOOP] to evolve the gauge and Yukawa couplings. We ignore small differences in the masses of the 4th and [formula]th generation particles or that of the supersymmetric particles which may be induced by the Yukawa couplings and simply set all their masses at [formula]. We also ignore threshold corrections. Therefore, between [formula] and [formula], we evolve the couplings with the RGE's for the Supersymmetric SM with 5 super-generations and 2 super-Higgs doublets, while between [formula] and MZ, we use the RGE's for the SM with only 3 ordinary generations and 1 Higgs doublet. The gauge couplings are connected continuously at [formula] while the up-type (down-type) Yukawa couplings are multiplied by sin β (cos β) below [formula] to take into account the decoupling of one of the Higgses.

The number of adjustable parameters in our model is four: the unification scale [formula], the unified gauge coupling [formula], the unified Yukawa coupling [formula], and the mixing angle of the low lying Higgs fields tan β  =  v2 / v1, where [formula]. We restrict [formula] and [formula] to the region

[formula]

(Note that [formula]. Note also that the natural expansion coefficient corresponding to the αi(μ)'s is Y2 / (4π) for the Yukawa's.) As we will see later, this will keep the gauge and Yukawa couplings within their perturbative regions throughout the evolution from [formula] to MZ.

Since we do not consider the evolution of the soft SUSY breaking parameters of the Higgs potential in this paper, tan β will remain a phenomenological parameter to be fixed by hand. We will use the τ-lepton mass to fix tan β from

[formula]

Gauge Coupling Unification:

The values of the SU(3)C  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y coupling constants at μ  =  MZ are given by [\cite=PDG:96] :

[formula]

Note that these are the [formula] coupling constants and that the U(1) coupling is normalized to [formula].

For fixed values of [formula] in the range given in Eq. ([\ref=eq:rangealy]), we searched for values of [formula] and [formula] which reproduced the experimental data given above. The results are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:Z1].

We see that the allowed range of [formula] is narrow for smaller [formula] but still exist down to [formula] and becomes wider as [formula] is increased. This result is as expected from our discussion on asymptotically non-free theories: a wider range of [formula] corresponds to a much smaller range of couplings at MZ, and the allowed range will become wider as [formula] is increased. However, if we increase [formula] beyond [formula], then [formula] and/or [formula] will have to be taken beyond the limits specified in Eq. ([\ref=eq:rangealy]) and they will be too large for the perturbative treatment of the RGE's to be reliable.

As an example, we show the running of the three gauge couplings in Fig. ([\ref=fig:Z2]) for typical values of [formula], [formula], and [formula]. We see a small deviation from linear dependence on log μ near [formula] where the couplings become large and the two-loop corrections start contributing to the running appreciably. However it is clear that two-loop contributions are still not very serious within the range of [formula] which we have chosen here and we may regard our perturbative treatment to be sufficient.

Yukawa Coupling Unification:

Next, we fix the values of [formula] and [formula] in the range allowed by gauge coupling unification and calculate the evolution of the Yukawa couplings for different values of [formula]. Typical evolutions of the τ, b, and t Yukawa couplings are shown in Figs. [\ref=fig:ytau], [\ref=fig:ybottom], and [\ref=fig:ytop]. As is evident from these figures, the asymptotic non-freeness of the gauge couplings has a strong focusing effect on the top and bottom Yukawa couplings as they evolve down in scale and as a result, the values of the two Yukawa's converge to IR fixed points by the time they reach the SUSY breaking scale [formula]. In the case of the τ Yukawa coupling, the situation is rather different. Near the GUT scale it tends to focus itself due to its larger size at [formula] (Recall [formula].). However, unlike the top and bottom Yukawa couplings, once Yτ becomes small at lower scales, it runs slowly and does not quite converge to its IR fixed point (yτ = 0).

Due to this IR fixed point behavior, the values of Yt(MZ), Yb(MZ) have almost no dependence on [formula]. They do depend on the value of [formula] but even then only very mildly.

Bottom to Tau Mass Ratio:

The b-τ mass ratio has been the most intensively studied quantity in both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric GUT scenarios. Many authors have investigated the possibility of unifying the two couplings with various degrees of success. [\cite=HALL:91] [\cite=LANGACKER:94] [\cite=VISSANI:94] [\cite=BRIGNOLE:94] [\cite=KELLEY:92] [\cite=BARGER:93] [\cite=BARDEEN:94] [\cite=BANDO:94] [\cite=POKORSKI:95]

Currently, the experimentally determined [formula] running masses of the τ-lepton and the b quark at μ  =  MZ are given by [\cite=PDG:96]

[formula]

from which we conclude

[formula]

The dependence of Rbτ(MZ) on [formula] and [formula] in our model is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:Rbtau]. Obviously, whether our model can reproduce the experimental value of Rbτ(MZ) or not depends almost solely on the value of [formula]. If [formula], then the QCD interactions near [formula] will be so strong that Yb will be enhanced too much relative to Yτ. However, there is still a large set of [formula] values which keeps Rbτ(MZ) below 2.

Of course, since tan β is large in our model there is potentially a very large radiative correction to mb from the loop induced coupling of the b quark to v2. [\cite=HALL:91] [\cite=BARDEEN:94] [\cite=BANKS:88] [\cite=HEMPFLING:94] This correction can throw our prediction off the mark by a considerable amount.

However, such corrections can easily be compensated for. If the correction makes Rbτ(MZ) smaller, we only need to make [formula] larger. If it makes Rbτ(MZ) larger, we only need to make [formula] smaller, changing [formula] and/or [formula] if necessary.

We therefore conclude that our model can accommodate the b-τ mass ratio quite easily without any fine tuning.

The Top Quark Mass:

Due to the IR fixed point behavior of Yτ, Yb, and Yt we have seen above, for the range of [formula] values that yield the correct value of Rbτ(MZ) we find:

[formula]

Using the τ mass to fix tan β, we find

[formula]

which is in perfect agreement with the experimental value [\cite=PDG:96] :

[formula]

This result is actually highly dependent on our choice Eq. ([\ref=yukawas]) for the 4th and [formula]th generation Yukawa couplings. Had we chosen a different condition such as

[formula]

then the IR fixed value for Yt would have been

[formula]

leading to a prediction of

[formula]

Summary and Conclusions :

We have presented an extension of the MSSM with a generation anti-generation pair of extra matter superfields. The SU(3)C  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y gauge couplings are asymptotically non-free in this model but still converge to a common value before any of them diverge. Consequences of this asymptotically non-free theory are:

The unified coupling [formula] and the unification scale [formula] need not be fine tuned to reproduce the values of the SU(3)C  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y gauge couplings at μ = MZ. Larger values of [formula] allow for a larger range of [formula] values. However, [formula] must be taken below [formula] to keep [formula] and [formula] within perturbative range.

The top and bottom Yukawa couplings are strongly focused onto IR fixed points. This makes the IR values of the two Yukawa couplings insensitive to their initial value [formula] at the GUT scale.

The model can reproduce the ratio of bottom and tau masses Rbτ(MZ)  =  Yb(MZ) / Yτ(MZ)  =  1.6  ~  2, provided we assume the unification condition [formula] ([formula]-Higgs) instead of the usual [formula] ([formula]-Higgs).

The model can also give the correct top mass provided the Yukawa couplings of the 4th and [formula]th generations are taken as in Eq. ([\ref=yukawas]).

It would be most interesting if this insensitivity of the low energy predictions to the initial conditions at the GUT scale could be taken further to include the soft SUSY breaking parameters of the Higgs sector. In particular, if a large tan β could be generated without fine tuning, it could provide an answer to the question why the top is so much heavier than the bottom.

Above [formula], our model is a supersymmetric SO(10) theory which includes four [formula]-plets and an [formula]-plet, and a Higgs sector which consist of at least an [formula] and an [formula] (in order for [formula] to have a mass term). This makes the SO(10) gauge coupling asymptotically non-free also.

It has recently been argued that such asymptotic non-freeness of the gauge couplings can be consistently interpreted as a sign of compositeness. [\cite=BANDO:96] The basic reasoning is as follows: The general compositeness condition of gauge bosons is given by [formula] where Z(μ) is the wave-function renormalization constant and [formula] is the compositeness scale. If one enforces conventional normalization Z(μ)  =  1 at all scales μ, then superficially the running gauge coupling α(μ) will diverge at [formula] making it look like an asymptotically non-free theory. This is analogous to theories with dynamically generated Higgs bosons where compositeness manifests itself as the divergence of the Yukawa coupling at the compositeness scale in the effective Higgs-Yukawa theory  [\cite=BARDEEN:90] .

In the SM, the large number of arbitrary parameters have lead most people to believe that going beyond the SM will somehow reduce the number of parameters and make theories more predictive. However, most extensions of the SM such as the MSSM or Technicolor actually increases the number of parameters by a huge amount. Reduction of the number of parameters is usually achieved by imposing ad hoc symmetries such as R-parity, universality of the scalar masses at the GUT scale, etc. What our analysis has shown is that for certain types of theories with IR fixed points, it may happen that most of the parameters simply do not matter or only needs to be specified to an order of magnitude to make precise low energy predictions. Clearly, the IR fixed point phenomena is an alternative to symmetries for making theories more predictive and deserves thorough and systematic investigation.

Solution to the one-loop RG equations

In this appendix, we give a qualitative interpretation of our results in the one-loop approximation.

The one-loop renormalization group equations above the SUSY scale in our model are as follows:

[formula]

Here, t =  log μ, [formula], and the one-loop beta function coefficients are given by the following formula:

[formula]

Since the model is nothing but the standard model below the SUSY scale, as can be seen from Fig. [\ref=fig:Z2], the experimental inputs are essentially equivalent to The solution to Eq.([\ref=eqn:alpha]) is From the above equation, and using [formula] and [formula] as inputs, we can predict [formula] as Note that only the differences of beta function coefficients appear in this expression. Therefore, at the one-loop level, the prediction of [formula] would be exactly the same for any [formula]. However, the two-loop correction which is O( max (α2(t))) would be different depending on whether the theory is asymptotically free or non-free. In the MSSM, the expected correction would be as large as [formula], whereas in the [formula] case, the correction would be as large as [formula]. Thus if the one-loop prediction differs from the experiment by more than a few percent, one has to consider rather large threshold correction at the GUT scale to explain the discrepancy in the MSSM whereas in the latter model there is still room for two-loop corrections to account for it.

Next, let us solve Eqs. ([\ref=eqn:yukawat])~  ([\ref=eqn:yukawatau]) to obtain the low energy behavior of the Yukawa couplings. The first term in each equation is the contribution from the gauge interactions and the second term in each equation is that from the Yukawa interactions. The gauge interactions try to enhance the Yukawa couplings as the scale is lowered whereas the Yukawa interactions tend to reduce it. Therefore, one can naively expect that the Yukawa couplings fall into infrared fixed points where the gauge contribution and the Yukawa contribution balance. Whether this is true or not depends on initial values and the details of the beta function coefficients.

In order to see this more explicitly, let us make the following three assumptions and reduce Eqs. ([\ref=eqn:yukawat])~  ([\ref=eqn:yukawatau]) into a much simpler form:

Since at low energy, α1,α2,  ≪  α3, we can neglect α1,α2.

At low energy, the contribution from ατ is not so dominant compared to those from αt,b. This is partly because the coefficient of ατ in Eq. ([\ref=eqn:yukawab]) is not so large and partly because in Eq. ([\ref=eqn:yukawatau]) there is no contribution from α3 which can prevent αyukawa getting small thus ατ gets small at lower energy much faster than αt,b.

Assuming 1 and 2, the difference between αt and αb is almost negligible. This is because we impose [formula] as the GUT scale initial condition, and because the approximate RG equation is symmetric under the interchange αt  ↔  αb.

In the following, we will obtain the solutions to the resulting approximate equations. Of course, the behavior of those solutions will be correct only qualitatively since the corrections from the neglected terms are not completely negligible. (In principle, it is possible to check the validity of this approximation by solving the full equations.) However, since we are only interested in the qualitative features, we will not discuss the corrections from the neglected terms here.

With these assumptions and by setting [formula], Eqs. ([\ref=eqn:yukawat]), ([\ref=eqn:yukawab]) become

[formula]

Let us define the ratio [formula]. Eq. ([\ref=eqn:yukawaQ]) is then

[formula]

It is easy to see that the solution to Eq. ([\ref=eqn:zQ]) is

[formula]

The exponent [formula] at [formula] ranges roughly from 8 to 12, thus at [formula] the quark Yukawa coupling gets very close to the infrared fixed point.

[formula]

This behavior of the quark Yukawa coupling is consistent with what we see from the numerical solution to the two-loop RG equation.

On the other hand, the one-loop RG equation for the bottom-tau ratio Rbτ can be obtained from Eqs .([\ref=eqn:yukawab]), ([\ref=eqn:yukawatau]). Using the assumptions, the equation at low energy can be simplified to

[formula]

It is easy to see that the solution to Eq. ([\ref=eqn:Requation]) is

[formula]

The factor [formula] at [formula] is about 4.1 to 7.5 for αGUT = 0.3  ~  0.55. This gives roughly the right enhancement for Rbτ.

On the other hand, the RG equations in the MSSM are given by:

[formula]

The one-loop beta function coefficients are given by the following formula: The equation for zQ is

[formula]

It is easy to see that the solution to Eq. ([\ref=eqn:zQs]) is

[formula]

The exponent [formula] at [formula] is roughly 2, thus at [formula] the focusing effect of quark Yukawa coupling is not as strong as in our 5 generation model.
