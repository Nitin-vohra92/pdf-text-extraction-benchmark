Introduction

Heckman-Opdam theory provides a powerful generalization of the theory of noncompact and compact Riemannian symmetric spaces and their spherical functions. In this theory (see e.g. [\cite=Op95], [\cite=Op00], [\cite=HS94]), the system of invariant differential operators on a Riemannian symmetric space is replaced by a commuting algebra of differential reflection operators, called Dunkl operators, which depend on some root system and on multiplicity parameters on the roots. The joint spectral problem for these operators is solved by multivariable hypergeometric functions and hypergeometric polynomials which include the spherical functions of Riemannian symmetric spaces for certain discrete values of the multiplicities.

In the context of Dunkl operators, the heat equation has already been studied in various settings. The rational case was treated by Rösler in [\cite=Ro98], while Schapira [\cite=Scha] studied the heat equation in the noncompact Heckman-Opdam theory. In the present paper we investigate the compact symmetric case, where we assume invariance under the Weyl group W. We are concerned with the heat equation for the Heckman-Opdam Laplacian Lm on a closed fundamental alcove A0 for the affine Weyl group. This Laplacian generalizes the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a Riemannian symmetric space of compact type. We prove that Lm has a closure which generates a Feller-Markov semigroup on the alcove, the Heckman-Opdam heat semigroup. We study smoothness properties of the heat kernel and also develop an Lp-theory for the heat equation on A0.

The second main topic of this paper is the Segal-Bargmann transform. Several generalizations of the classical Segal-Bargmann transform to different settings are known. The Segal-Bargmann transform for compact Lie groups was introduced by Hall [\cite=Hall], where also the case of compact symmetric spaces was considered. Different approaches in the case of compact symmetric spaces were given by Stenzel [\cite=St99] and Faraut [\cite=Faraut]. In the framework of Dunkl theory, the rational case has been studied by several authors, see [\cite=Soltani], [\cite=SaidOrsted], [\cite=Sontz]. Apart from the rank one case, an explicit description of the Segal-Bargmann space as an L2-space of holomorphic functions has so far not been found in this setting. Ben Saïd and Ørsted [\cite=SaidOrsted] instead gave a description as a Fock space generated by a certain reproducing kernel (which is given by the rational Dunkl kernel). The noncompact, symmetric Heckman-Opdam case was investigated in 2007 by Ólafsson and Schlichtkrull [\cite=OS07].

In this paper, we study the Segal-Bargmann transform in the compact symmetric Heckman-Opdam setting. We extend the heat transform to a unitary isomorphism from the weighted L2-space on the alcove A0 to a Segal-Bargmann space Ht, which is a Hilbert space of holomorphic functions. Its inner product is described as an L2-product involving the heat kernel from the noncompact theory as a weight.

The organization of this paper is as follows: In Section [\ref=sec_dunkl], we recall some basics of trigonometric Dunkl theory. In Section [\ref=sec_heat] the heat equation and the heat semigroup on the fundamental alcove A0 are studied. Finally, the Segal-Bargmann transform is developed in Section [\ref=sec_SB].

Fundamentals of Trigonometric Dunkl Theory

We start with a short review of the fundamentals of trigonometric Dunkl theory which will be needed in this article. For details, we refer to the work of Heckman and Opdam [\cite=Op95], [\cite=Op00], [\cite=HS94], and the references cited there.

Let [formula] be a finite-dimensional Euclidean space with inner product 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉, which is extended to a complex bilinear form on the complexification [formula] of [formula]. We identify [formula] with its dual space [formula] via the given inner product. Let [formula] be a (not necessarily reduced) root system. For α∈Σ we write [formula] for the coroot of α and denote by [formula] the reflection in the hyperplane Hα perpendicular to α.

The reflections {sα  :  α∈Σ} generate the Weyl group W = W(Σ). We define the root lattice [formula] and the coroot lattice [formula]. Further, we fix some positive subsystem Σ+ of Σ. An element [formula] is called (strictly) dominant, if 〈λ,α〉  ≥  0 (respectively > 0) for all α∈Σ+. We write

[formula]

for the Weyl chamber of strictly dominant elements.

For α∈Σ and [formula] let The weight lattice is given by and the set is called the lattice of dominant weights. Here we use the notation [formula]. The positive root lattice [formula] defines a partial ordering [formula] on [formula]:

[formula]

This ordering is called the dominance ordering. Two simple properties are given in the following Lemma.

Part (i) is Lemma 10.3B in [\cite=Humph]. For the proof of (ii), notice that λ  +  μ is also dominant and λ  -  μ is a sum of positive roots. Therefore

[formula]

A multiplicity function is a W-invariant map [formula], α  ↦  mα. We denote the set of multiplicity functions by M. In this article we only consider non-negative multiplicities, i.e. mα  ≥  0 for all α∈Σ. Define

[formula]

Let [formula] and m∈M. The Dunkl-Cherednik operator associated with Σ and m is given by

[formula]

where ∂ξ is the usual directional derivative and eλ(ξ): = e〈λ,ξ〉 for [formula].

Heckman and Opdam use a slightly different notation. They consider a root system R with multiplicity k, which is connected to our notation via

[formula]

Our notation comes from the theory of symmetric spaces.

For fixed multiplicity m, the operators Tξ, [formula] commute. Therefore the assignment ξ  ↦  T(ξ,m) uniquely extends to a homomorphism on the symmetric algebra [formula] over [formula], which may be identified with the algebra of complex polynomials on [formula]. Let T(p,m) be the operator which in this way corresponds to [formula]. If [formula], the subspace of W-invariant polynomials on [formula], then T(p,m) acts as a differential operator on the space of W-invariant analytic functions on [formula].

The solution of the joint spectral problem for these differential operators is due to Heckman and Opdam, see [\cite=HS94] and [\cite=Op95]:

The function F(λ,m;x) is W-invariant in both λ and x. It is called the hypergeometric function associated with Σ. For certain spectral parameters λ, the functions Fλ are actually trigonometric polynomials, the so-called Heckman-Opdam polynomials. In order to make this precise, we need some more notation.

Let [formula] be the space of trigonometric polynomials associated with Λ. Trigonometric polynomials are [formula]-periodic, and TξT  ⊂  T. Consider the torus [formula] with the W-invariant weight function

[formula]

Let

[formula]

denote the W-invariant orbit sums. They form a basis of the space of W-invariant trigonometric polynomials TW. For λ∈Λ+ the Heckman-Opdam polynomials associated with Σ are defined by

[formula]

where the coefficients cλμ(m) are uniquely determined by the conditions

The Jacobi polynomials Pλ form an orthogonal basis of L2(T,wm)W, the subspace of W-invariant elements from L2(T,wm).

Notice that our notation slightly differs from that of Heckman and Opdam (e.g. [\cite=HS94], [\cite=Op00]), namely by a factor i in the spectral variable. This choice of notation will be more convenient for our purposes.

The connection between the Jacobi polynomials and the hypergeometric function is as follows:

We shall work with the renormalized Jacobi polynomials, defined by

[formula]

They satisfy

[formula]

Dividing the torus [formula] by the action of the Weyl group W gives the closed fundamental alcove

[formula]

We may consider W-invariant trigonometric polynomials as functions on A0. Another way of considering a W-invariant and [formula]-periodic function f on [formula] is to say that f is [formula]-invariant, where

[formula]

is the affine Weyl group. The closed alcove A0 is a fundamental domain for the action of [formula] on [formula].

The Jacobi polynomials Rλ are orthogonal with respect to the inner product

[formula]

but they are not orthonormal. We put Then the set [formula] is an orthonormal basis of L2(A0,wm).

We shall need the following facts about the Jacobi polynomials Pλ and Rλ:

The heat equation on the alcove

In this section we consider the W-invariant part of the Heckman-Opdam Laplacian on the alcove, which coincides with the radial part of the Laplace Beltrami operator of a compact symmetric space U / K in geometric cases. We study the associated heat semigroup - the Heckman-Opdam heat semigroup - and its integral kernel Γm. In particular, we show that this heat kernel can be holomorphically extended to [formula], which will be important for the following section, where we study the Segal-Bargmann transform.

The Heckman-Opdam Laplacian is defined by where T(ξi,m) is the Dunkl-Cherednik operator of Definition [\ref=Def_DO] and [formula] is an orthonormal basis of [formula]. The operator Δm does not depend on the choice of the basis and has the explicit form where Δ denotes the Euclidean Laplacian on [formula] (See [\cite=Scha] and recall R = 2Σ and [formula]).

We now restrict our attention to W-invariant functions. Keeping in mind that our notation differs by a factor i from that of Heckman and Opdam (see Remark [\ref=Bem_i]), we consider the operator on [formula]. Then for f(x)  =  g(ix), we just have

[formula]

Consider a compact symmetric space U / K on which K acts from the left with restricted root system Σ and geometric multiplicity m. Then Lm is just the radial part of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on U / K. See Proposition 3.11, Chapter II in [\cite=Hel84].

The Jacobi polynomials Rλ are eigenfunctions of Lm:

[formula]

This follows from equation ([formula]). The eigenvalues are negative,

[formula]

since λ and ρ are both contained in the Weyl chamber [formula] and therefore 〈λ,ρ〉  ≥  0. We shall use the abbreviation

The Heckman-Opdam heat equation on A0 is given by A formal derivation via Heckman-Opdam transform

[formula]

motivates the following

The heat kernel Γm on A0  ×  A0  ×  (0,  ∞  ) is defined by

We shall also consider Γm as a function on [formula] which is [formula]-invariant in the first and second argument. We still have to show that the series converges. This will be a consequence of the following Lemma which states that the growth of the rλ is polynomial in λα,  α∈Σ+. We start with some simple observations. First, recall from Remark [\ref=Norm_Jacobi] (b) that the coefficients dλμ in the exponential expansion of the Jacobi polynomials Rλ are nonnegative and sum up to 1. Therefore

[formula]

For the summands of Γm this implies

[formula]

According to Lemma [\ref=Hyper_Jacobi] and Remark [\ref=Norm_Jacobi] (a) we have

[formula]

where c > 0 is a constant depending only on m and

[formula]

We use the well known asymptotics of the Γ-function:

[formula]

Then for all α∈Σ+ and λα  →    ∞   this implies the asymptotic Since Σ+ is finite, we find a constant M  >  0 such that for all positive roots

[formula]

Fix such M, and denote by L > 0 a common upper bound such that

[formula]

Now let us temporarily fix a λ∈Λ+. We decompose the set of positive roots in two disjoint sets [formula], where

[formula]

Application of estimates ([formula]) and ([formula]) then yields: Without loss of generality we may assume L  ≥  1. Note that λα  ≠  0 implies λα  ≥  1 (since [formula]). Therefore we can extend the above estimate: This holds independently of λ and implies the lemma.

The consequence of this lemma is that the growth of the summands in the heat kernel Γm for λ  →    ∞   is dominated by e-  θλt, which decays for fixed t > 0 as e-  |λ|2t. With [\eqref=Schranke_Summanden] we conclude

One would expect from classical theory of the heat equation that the heat kernel is smooth. This is also true in our setting.

It is obvious that Rλ is holomorphic on [formula]. Therefore each summand in [formula] is holomorphic, and normal convergence of the series will imply that F is holomorphic on [formula] To see this, recall that the Jacobi polynomial Rλ is a linear combination of exponentials eiγ with [formula] according to Lemma [\ref=Ordnung_W] (i). Part (ii) of Lemma [\ref=Ordnung_W] then implies |γ|  ≤  |λ|. Therefore

[formula]

For M > 0, consider the compact ball [formula]. Then for z∈K we obtain the following estimate:

[formula]

Here we used dλγ  ≥  0 and [formula] (see Remark [\ref=Norm_Jacobi] (b)). With a similar estimate for Rλ(w) we see that the growth behaviour of each summand of F is dominated by the term e-  θλt0 on K  ×  K. Thus we have normal convergence on compact subsets of [formula], which implies that F is holomorphic on [formula]. Finally note that termwise differentiating with respect to t gives a factor -  θλ but does not change the convergence.

Next we collect some further basic properties of the heat kernel:

Part (a) follows from [\eqref=eigenequation] and termwise differentiation. The further statements are obtained by direct calculation, using the orthogonality of the polynomials Rλ with respect to 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉m, and the fact that [formula] for all [formula]

For f∈L1(A0,wm) we define

[formula]

With the Heckman-Opdam transform, we can write Because of [formula] and Proposition [\ref=Schranke_Gamma] this sum converges absolutely and uniformly on A0.

This follows directly from Proposition [\ref=Schranke_Gamma] and Lemma [\ref=Eig_Gamma] (c).

Since A0 is compact we have continuous embeddings

[formula]

In particular, Lemma [\ref=Schranke_H_tf_1] implies that the family (H(t))t  ≥  0 forms a semigroup of bounded linear operators on the Banach space [formula] We shall prove that this semigroup is actually a Feller-Markov semigroup on C(A0) which is generated by the closure of the Heckman-Opdam Laplacian Lm. Feller-Markov means that the semigroup is strongly continuous, contractive and positive, i.e. f  ≥  0 on A0 implies H(t)f  ≥  0 on A0. As for the rational Dunkl case and the noncompact trigonometric case in [\cite=Ro98] and [\cite=Scha], the proof of the positivity part will be based on a variant of the Lumer-Phillips theorem characterizing the generator of a Feller-Markov semigroup, c.f. Theorem 2.2. of [\cite=EK86].

We call (H(t))t  ≥  0 the Heckman-Opdam heat semigroup on A0.

We first prove strong continuity and determine the generator. For this, notice that

[formula]

This immediately implies strong continuity of the semigroup on the space TW of W-invariant trigonometric polynomials. As TW is dense in C(A0), we obtain strong continuity on all of C(A0). Let A be the generator of (H(t))t  ≥  0. Since TW is also H(t)-invariant it is by Nelson's Lemma (Theorem 6.1.18, [\cite=Davies]) a core for the generator A. We calculate

[formula]

This shows that   A|TW = Lm. It remains to prove that the semigroup (H(t))t  ≥  0 is Feller-Markov. We shall apply Theorem 2.2. of [\cite=EK86] where we consider [formula]-valued functions on A0. We thus have to check the following three conditions:

Condition (i) is obvious. Condition (ii) is also clear because we already know that (H(t))t  ≥  0 is a strongly continuous semigroup and therefore t > 0 is contained in the resolvent set of A for t large enough. The positive maximum principle is obvious when [formula] for all α∈Σ. If 〈α,x0〉 = 0 for some α∈Σ one has to use a similar argument as in the proof of Lemma 4.1 in [\cite=Ro98]: Consider f as a [formula]-invariant function on [formula] and let [formula] for all α∈Σ. Then Taylor expansion yields

[formula]

where ξ lies on the line segment between x and sαx. Therefore

[formula]

The positivity of the heat semigroup implies that Γm is non-negative on the alcove A0. In fact we have more:

Assume that Γm(x0,y0,t0) = 0. According to Lemma [\ref=Eig_Gamma] (c) we have

[formula]

Let [formula]. Now the positivity of the heat semigroup implies Γm  ≥  0. Therefore

[formula]

But we already know from Proposition [\ref=Kern_holomorph] that Ft is holomorphic in both arguments. If the product of two holomorphic functions vanishes on an open, connected and nonempty set, then one of them has to be identically zero. But this is a contradiction to [formula].

Let us conclude this section with some remarks concerning Lp-theory and behaviour for t  →    ∞  : So far we have considered the heat semigroup on the space of continuous functions C(A0). But an Lp(A0,wm)-theory (1  ≤  p  ≤    ∞  ) is easily developed:

By Lemma [\ref=Schranke_H_tf_1] and the embeddings [\eqref=imbed], each H(t) defines a bounded linear operator on Lp(A0,wm) for 1  ≤  p  ≤    ∞  .

The positivity of Γm implies that H(t) is positive on Lp(A0,wm). Moreover, if 1  ≤  p  <    ∞   then Jensen's inequality implies

[formula]

and therefore [formula]. For p =   ∞  , this estimate is obvious. It remains to check strong continuity of the semigroup on the dense subspace TW. But as in the case of C(A0), this is immediate from [\eqref=H_tR].

The L2-theory of the heat semigroup is particularly explicit. The Laplacian Lm with domain TW is symmetric in L2(T,wm) ([\cite=Op95], Proposition 2.3), and the Jacobi polynomials Rλ form a complete set of eigenfunctions with real eigenvalues. Therefore Lm is essentially self-adjoint. Its closure is given by orthogonal expansion with respect to the Jacobi basis:

[formula]

with domain

[formula]

This self-adjoint operator generates a strongly continuous semigroup [formula] on L2(A0,wm). By Borel functional calculus,

[formula]

and for general [formula]

[formula]

This coincides with the heat semigroup (H(t))t  ≥  0 on L2(A0,wm).

For t  →    ∞   the heat (given by the initial distribution f) spreads uniformly on the alcove:

Write

[formula]

and take the limit t  →    ∞  .

The Segal-Bargmann transform

In this section we focus on the L2-setting. The smoothness of the heat kernel implies that the heat transform f  ↦  H(t)f smoothens arbitrary initial data. We shall see that it actually gives rise to a unitary isomorphism between L2(A0,wm) and a certain Hilbert space Ht of holomorphic functions on [formula] - the so called Segal-Bargmann transform.

Let us start with a short reminder of the classical situation for the one-dimensional torus [formula]; for details see e.g. [\cite=Faraut].

We shall now extend this result to the compact (and Weyl-group invariant) Heckman-Opdam case. The classical example as well as the theory in the case of compact symmetric spaces indicates that the Segal-Bargmann space will depend on the noncompact heat kernel (see [\cite=Faraut]).

(The noncompact heat equation) The noncompact Heckman-Opdam heat equation was studied by Schapira [\cite=Scha]. Let us recall some results:

Denote by Dm the W-invariant part of Δm, i.e.

[formula]

The hypergeometric function Fλ is an eigenfunction of the operator Dm:

[formula]

The operator Dm has a closure which generates the noncompact heat semigroup [formula] on [formula]. The W-invariant noncompact heat kernel is given by We will use the notation γ1t(x): = γ1t(x,0) in the following. From [formula] we see that

[formula]

where

[formula]

is Opdam's weight function.

We now turn to the holomorphic extension of the heat transform on L2(A0,wm). Recall that the heat kernel

[formula]

is holomorphic in (z,w), where the series converges normally on compact subsets of [formula] Thus for f∈L2(A0,wm) and t  >  0, the heat transform H(t)f given by [\eqref=heatdef] extends to a holomorphic function on [formula], Alternatively, this can be written as

[formula]

where the sum converges normally on compact subsets of [formula]

In the following H(t) shall always stand for the analytic continuation of the heat transform to [formula].

Define [formula] as the holomorphic image of the heat transform with inner product

[formula]

The heat transform L2(A0,wm)  →  Ft is by definition a unitary isomorphism. The set TW is dense in L2(A0,wm) and therefore also in Ft (recall that H(t) maps TW onto itself). Finally let F  =  H(t)f∈Ft. Then

[formula]

with

[formula]

according to Lemma [\ref=Eig_Gamma] (c).

We are interested in a more explicit description of the image of H(t) as a Hilbert space of holomorphic functions.

Assume that the Fourier coefficients of f∈L2(A0,wm) satisfy the growth condition

[formula]

For such f and [formula] we define a generalized translation by

[formula]

Recalling that   Rλ( - ix)  =  Fλ  +  ρ(x), we observe that τixf∈L2(A0,wm) if and only if

[formula]

Notice also that x  ↦  τixf(y) is W-invariant on [formula]. According to Proposition 6.1 in [\cite=Op95], the hypergeometric function satisfies a growth estimate

[formula]

with a constant C independent of x and λ. This shows that condition [\eqref=L2cond] above is implied by our growth condition [formula], and the above translation is indeed well-defined. Note also that

Next we define the target space of the Segal-Bargmann transform:

Let

[formula]

with the inner product

[formula]

Here the (Heckman-Opdam) Fourier transform [formula] is with respect to real part x of the variable.

Note that functions in Ht automatically satisfy growth condition [formula] (with respect to the real part of the variable). Moreover, the identity theorem implies that each F∈Ht is invariant under the action of W on [formula], i.e. it is W-invariant also in the imaginary part of its argument.

Let us recall the definition: A Hilbert space of holomorphic functions H on a domain D is a subspace of O(D) with the structure of a Hilbert space such that the embedding [formula] is continuous.

This means, for every compact subset [formula] we have to find a constant CK such that

[formula]

We claim that each F∈Ht can be written as

[formula]

where the series converges normally on each compact subset K of [formula] Indeed, let z∈K with [formula]. Then

[formula]

Now the first factor is just [formula] and for the second factor we use the estimate [formula] to obtain a constant CK such that

[formula]

As a consequence, the sum in [\eqref=F_Entw] defines a holomorphic function on [formula]. On the other hand, for given f∈L2(A0) the sum [formula] is just the expansion of f with respect to the orthonormal basis of Heckman-Opdam polynomials. Since F∈Ht is continuous and bounded in the real part (as a [formula]-invariant function) we have F∈L2(A0) and therefore [formula] a.e. on A0. Now the identity theorem implies the claim [formula].

Relation [formula] together with [formula] show that the embedding [formula] is continuous. It remains to check that Ht is complete with respect to the given inner product 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉Ht. For this, consider a Cauchy sequence (Fn) in Ht. Because of the continuous embedding it converges uniformly on compact subsets of [formula] to some limit [formula] which is [formula]-periodic in its real part. In particular (Fn) converges uniformly on the alcove A0. This implies that   (λ)  →  (λ) uniformly in λ, and therefore lim n  →    ∞Fn  =  F in Ht.

In the next Proposition we give another representation of the inner product of Ht and state its reproducing kernel.

We remark that in [\eqref=H_T_alternativ], [formula] can be replaced by [formula] because x  ↦  τixF(y) and the heat kernel γ12t are W-invariant.

We already remarked that τixF is well defined for functions in Ht. Using dominated convergence we calculate

[formula]

Here we used Rλ( - ix)  =  Fλ  +  ρ(x) and [formula]. For the reproducing kernel property note that for [formula] we have

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

which is equal to F(z) according to [formula].

So Ft and Ht have the same reproducing kernel. But then by general Hilbert space theory they have to coincide. The holomorphic heat transform H(t):L2(A0,wm)  →  Ft is by definition a unitary isomorphism. We conclude
