Introduction

In [\cite=Stallings], J. Stallings proved that finitely generated groups with more than one end split non-trivially as an amalgamated product [formula] (where non-trivial means A  ≠  C  ≠  B) or an HNN-extension [formula] with C a finite group. In about 1970, C. T. C. Wall raised questions about whether or not one could begin with a group A0 and for i > 0, produce a infinite sequence of non-trivial splittings, [formula] or [formula] of Ai - 1, with Ci is finite. When such a sequence could not exist, Wall called the group A0, accessible over such splittings. In [\cite=Dunwoody] M. Dunwoody proved that finitely presented groups are accessible with respect to splittings over finite groups. This implies that for a finitely presented group G there is no infinite sequence [formula] of graph of groups decomposition of G such that Λ1 is the trivial decomposition (with 1-vertex) and for i > 1, Λi is obtained from Λi - 1 by non-trivially splitting a vertex group over a finite group, replacing this vertex group by the splitting and then reducing. (For splittings over finite groups there is never a compatibility problem.) Instead any such sequence of decompositions must terminate in one in which each vertex group is either 1-ended or finite and all edge groups are finite. The class of small groups is defined in terms of actions on trees and is contained in the class of groups that contain no non-abelian free group as a subgroup. In [\cite=BestvinaFeighn], M. Bestvina and M. Feighn show that for a finitely presented group G there is a bound N(G) on the number of edges in a reduced graph of groups decomposition of G, when edge groups are small. Limits of this sort are generally called "accessibility" results. If C is a class of groups then call a graph of groups decomposition of a group G with edge groups in C a C-decomposition of G. A group G is called strongly accessible over C if there is a bound on the number of terms in a sequence [formula] of C-decompositions of G, such that Λ1 is the trivial decomposition, and for i > 1, Λi is obtained from Λi - 1 by replacing a vertex group of Λi - 1 with a compatible splitting [formula] or [formula] (C∈C) and then reducing. We call a group G accessible over a class of groups C if there is a bound N(G) on the number of edge groups in a reduced graph of groups decomposition of G with edge groups in C. Certainly strong accessibility implies accessibility. Dunwoody's theorem is a strong accessibility result for finitely presented groups over the class of finite groups. We know of no example where accessibility and strong accessibility are different.

In this paper, we produce accessibility results for finitely generated Coxeter groups. In analogy with the 1-ended assumptions of Rips-Sela [\cite=RipsSela], and the minimality assumptions of [\cite=DunwoodySageev], we consider the class M(W) of minimal splitting subgroups of W. If H and K are subgroups of a group W then H is smaller than K if [formula] has finite index in H and infinite index in K. If W is a group, then define M(W), the set of minimal splitting subgroups of W, to be the set of all subgroups H of W, such that W splits non-trivially (as an amalgamated product or HNN-extension) over H and for any other splitting subgroup K of W, K is not smaller than H.

A minimal splitting subgroup of a finitely generated Coxeter group W is finitely generated. This follows from remark 1 of [\cite=MTVisual]. Suppose [formula] is a non-trivial splitting of W and C is not finitely generated. There a reduced visual decomposition of W with (visual and hence finitely generated) edge group E such that a conjugate of E is a subgroup of C. Hence some conjugate of E is smaller than C.

Finite splitting subgroups are always minimal and if a group is 1-ended, then any 2-ended splitting subgroup is minimal. Our main theorem is:

Finitely generated Coxeter groups are strongly accessible over minimal splittings.

Our basic reference for Coxeter groups is Bourbaki [\cite=Bourbaki]. A Coxeter presentation is given by

[formula]

where [formula] is such that m(s,t) = 1 iff s = t and m(s,t) = m(t,s). The pair (W,S) is called a Coxeter system. In the group with this presentation, the elements of S are distinct elements of order 2 and a product st of generators has order m(s,t). Distinct generators commute if and only if m(s,t) = 2. A subgroup of W generated by a subset S' of S is called special or visual, and the pair (〈S'〉,S') is a Coxeter system with [formula] the restriction of m. A simple analysis of a Coxeter presentation allows one to construct all decompositions of W with only visual vertex and edge groups from that Coxeter presentation. In [\cite=MTVisual], the authors show that for any finitely generated Coxeter system (W,S) and any graph of groups decomposition Λ of W, there is an associated "visual" graph of groups decomposition Ψ of W with edge and vertex groups visual, and such that each vertex (respectively edge) group of Ψ is contained in a conjugate of a vertex (respectively edge) group of Λ. This result is called "the visual decomposition theorem for finitely generated Coxeter groups", and we say Ψ is a visual decomposition for Λ. Clearly accessibility of finitely generated Coxeter groups is not violated by only visual decompositions. But, we give an example in [\cite=MTVisual], of a finitely generated Coxeter system (W,S) and a sequence Λi (i  ≥  1) of (non-visual) reduced graph of groups decompositions of W, such that Λi has i-edge groups and, for i > 1, Λi is obtained by compatibly splitting a vertex group of Λi - 1. Hence, even in the light of the visual decomposition theorem and our accessibility results here, there is no accessibility for Coxeter groups over arbitrary splittings.

Theorem [\ref=Main] implies there are irreducible decompositions of finitely generated Coxeter groups, with minimal splitting edge groups. Our next result implies that any such irreducible decomposition has an "equivalent" visual counterpart.

Suppose (W,S) is a Coxeter system and Λ is a reduced graph of groups decomposition of W with M(W) edge groups. If Λ is irreducible with respect to M(W) splittings, and Ψ is a reduced graph of groups decomposition such that each edge group of Ψ is in M(W), each vertex group of Ψ is a subgroup of a conjugate of a vertex group of Λ, and each edge group of Λ contains a conjugate of an edge group of Ψ (in particular if Ψ is a reduced visual graph of groups decomposition for (W,S) derived from Λ as in the main theorem of [\cite=MTVisual]), then

Ψ is irreducible with respect to M(W) splittings

There is a (unique) bijection α of the vertices of Λ to the vertices of Ψ such that for each vertex V of Λ, Λ(V) is conjugate to Ψ(α(V))

When Ψ is visual, each edge group of Λ is conjugate to a visual subgroup for (W,S).

The vertex groups of Λ in theorem [\ref=Close] are Coxeter, and when W is not indecomposable, they have fewer generators than there are in S. Hence they have irreducible decompositions of the same type. As the number of Coxeter generators decreases each time we pass from a non-indecomposable vertex group to a vertex group of an irreducible decomposition with minimal splitting edge groups for that vertex group, eventually this must process must terminate with (up to conjugation) irreducible visual subgroups of (W,S). These terminal groups are maximal FA subgroups of W and must be conjugate to the visual subgroups of W determined by maximal complete subsets of the presentation diagram Γ(W,S) (see [\cite=MTVisual]).

The paper is laid out as follows: in § 2 we state the visual decomposition theorem and review the basics of graphs of groups decompositions.

In § 3, we list several well-known technical facts about Coxeter groups. § 3 concludes with an argument that shows an infinite subgroup of a finitely generated Coxeter group W (with Coxeter system (W,S)), containing a visual finite index subgroup 〈A〉 (A  ⊂  S) decomposes as 〈A0〉  ×  F where A0  ⊂  A and F is a finite subgroup of a finite group 〈D〉 where D  ⊂  S and D commutes with A0. This result makes it possible for us to understand arbitrary minimal splitting subgroups of W in our analysis of strong accessibility.

In § 4, we begin our analysis of M(W) by classify the visual members of M(W) for any Coxeter system (W,S). Proposition [\ref=L24N] shows that for a non-trivial splitting [formula] of a finitely generated Coxeter group W over a non-minimal group C, there is a splitting of W over a minimal splitting subgroup M, such that M is smaller than C. I.e. all non-trivial splittings of a finitely generated Coxeter group are "refined" by minimal splittings. Theorem [\ref=T1N] is the analogue of theorem [\ref=artificial] (from [\cite=MTVisual]), when edge groups of a graph of groups decomposition of a finitely generated Coxeter group are minimal splitting subgroups. The implications with this additional "minimal splitting" hypothesis far exceed the conclusions of theorem [\ref=artificial] and supply one of the more important technical results of paper. Roughly speaking, proposition [\ref=P3N] says that any graph of groups decomposition of a finitely generated Coxeter group with edge groups equal to minimal splitting subgroups of the Coxeter group is, up to "artificial considerations", visual. Proposition [\ref=P3N] gives another key idea towards the proof of the main theorem. It allows us to define a descending sequence of positive integers corresponding to a given sequence of graphs of groups as in the main theorem. Finally, theorem [\ref=vismin] is a minimal splitting version of the visual decomposition theorem of [\cite=MTVisual].

In § 5, we define what it means for a visual decomposition of a Coxeter group W, with M(W) edge groups, to look irreducible with respect to M(W) subgroups. We show that a visual decomposition looks irreducible if and only if it is irreducible. This implies that all irreducible visual decompositions of a Coxeter group can be constructed by an elementary algorithm. Our main results, theorems [\ref=Main] and [\ref=Close] are proved in .

In the final section, § 6, we begin with a list of generalizations of our results that follow from the techniques of the paper. Then, we give an analysis of minimal splitting subgroups of ascending HNN extensions, followed by a complete analysis of minimal splittings of general finitely generated groups that contain no non-abelian free group. This includes an analysis of Thompson's group F. We conclude with a list of questions.

Graph of Groups and Visual Decompositions

Section 2 of [\cite=MTVisual] is an introduction to graphs of groups that is completely sufficient for our needs in this paper. We include the necessary terminology here. A graph of groups Λ consists of a set V(Λ) of vertices, a set E(Λ) of edges, and maps ι,τ:E(Λ)  →  V(Λ) giving the initial and terminal vertices of each edge in a connected graph, together with vertex groups Λ(V) for V∈V(Λ), edge groups Λ(E) for E∈E(Λ), with Λ(E)  ⊂  Λ(ι(E)) and an injective group homomorphism tE:Λ(E)  →  Λ(τ(E)), called the edge map of E and denoted by tE:g  ↦  gtE. The fundamental group π(Λ) of a graph of groups Λ is the group with presentation having generators the disjoint union of Λ(V) for V∈V(Λ), together with a symbol tE for each edge E∈E(Λ), and having as defining relations the relations for each Λ(V), the relations gtE = tEgtE for E∈E(Λ) and g∈Λ(ι(E)), and relations tE = 1 for E in a given spanning tree of Λ (the result, up to isomorphism, is independent of the spanning tree taken).

If V is a vertex of a graph of groups decomposition Λ of a group G and Φ is a decomposition of Λ(V) so that for each edge E of Λ adjacent to V, Λ(E) is Λ(V)-conjugate to a subgroup of a vertex group of Φ, then Φ is compatible with Λ. Then V can be replaced by Φ to form a finer graph of groups decomposition of G.

A graph of groups is reduced if no edge between distinct vertices has edge group the same as an endpoint vertex group. If a graph of groups is not reduced, then we may collapse a vertex across an edge, giving a smaller graph of groups decomposition of the group.

If there is no non-trivial homomorphism of a group to the infinite cyclic group [formula], then a graph of groups decomposition of the group cannot contain a loop. In this case, the graph is a tree. In particular, any graph of groups decomposition of a Coxeter group has underlying graph a tree.

Suppose 〈S:m(s,t) (s,t∈S, m(s,t) <   ∞  )〉 is a Coxeter presentation for the Coxeter group W. The presentation diagram Γ(W,S) of W with respect to S has vertex set S and an undirected edge labeled m(s,t) connecting vertices s and t if m(s,t) <   ∞  . It is evident from the above presentation that if a subset C of S separates Γ(W,S), A is C union some of the components of Γ - C and B is C union the rest of the components, then W decomposes as [formula]. This generalizes to graphs of groups decompositions of Coxeter groups where each vertex and edge group is generated by a subset of S. We say that Ψ is a visual graph of groups decomposition of W (for a given S), if each vertex and edge group of Ψ is a special subgroup of W, the injections of each edge group into its endpoint vertex groups are given simply by inclusion, and the fundamental group of Ψ is isomorphic to W by the homomorphism induced by the inclusion map of vertex groups into W. If C and D are subsets of S, then we say C separates D in Γ if there are points d1 and d1 of D - C, such that any path in Γ connecting d1 and d2 contains a point of C.

The following lemma of [\cite=MTVisual] makes it possible to understand when a graph of groups with special subgroups has fundamental group W.

Suppose (W,S) is a Coxeter system. A graph of groups Ψ with graph a tree, where each vertex group and edge group is a special subgroup and each edge map is given by inclusion, is a visual graph of groups decomposition of W iff each edge in the presentation diagram of W is an edge in the presentation diagram of a vertex group and, for each generator s∈S, the set of vertices and edges with groups containing s is a nonempty subtree in Ψ.

In section 4 we describe when visual graph of groups decompositions with minimal splitting edge groups are irreducible with respect to splittings over minimal splitting subgroups. The next lemma follows easily from lemma [\ref=MT2] and helps make that description possible.

Suppose Ψ is a visual graph of groups decomposition for the finitely generated Coxeter system (W,S), V  ⊂  S is such that 〈V〉 is a vertex group of Ψ and E  ⊂  V separates V in Γ(W,S). Then 〈V〉 splits over 〈E〉, non-trivially and compatibly with Ψ to give a finer visual decomposition for (W,S) if and only if there are subsets A and B of S such that A is equal to E union (the vertices of) some of the components of Γ - E, B is E union the rest of the components of Γ - E, [formula], and for each edge D of Ψ which is adjacent to V, and DS  ⊂  S such that 〈DS〉  =  Ψ(D), we have DS  ⊂  A or DS  ⊂  B. The Ψ-compatible splitting of 〈V〉 is [formula].

The main theorem of [\cite=MTVisual] is "the visual decomposition theorem for finitely generated Coxeter groups":

Suppose (W,S) is a Coxeter system and Λ is a graph of groups decomposition of W. Then W has a visual graph of groups decomposition Ψ, where each vertex (edge) group of Ψ is a subgroup of a conjugate of a vertex (respectively edge) group of Λ. Moreover, Ψ can be taken so that each special subgroup of W that is a subgroup of a conjugate of a vertex group of Λ is a subgroup of a vertex group of Ψ.

If (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system, Λ is a graph of groups decomposition of W and Ψ satisfies the conclusion of theorem [\ref=MT1] (including the moreover clause) and then Ψ is called a visual decomposition from Λ (see [\cite=MTVisual]). In remark 1 of [\cite=MTVisual], it is shown that if Λ is reduced and Ψ is a visual decomposition from Λ then for any edge E of Λ there is an edge D of Ψ such that Ψ(D) is conjugate to a subgroup of Λ(E).

If a group G decomposes as [formula] and H is a subgroup of B, then the group [formula] decomposes as [formula]. Furthermore, G decomposes as [formula], giving a somewhat "artificial" decomposition of G. In [\cite=MTVisual], this idea is used on a certain Coxeter system (W,S) to produce reduced graph of groups decompositions of W with arbitrarily large numbers of edges.

The following theorem of [\cite=MTVisual] establishes limits on how far an arbitrary graph of groups decomposition for a finitely generated Coxeter system can stray from a visual decomposition for that system.

Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system, Λ is a graph of groups decomposition of W and Ψ is a reduced graph of groups decomposition of W such that each vertex group of Ψ is a subgroup of a conjugate of a vertex group of Λ. Then for each vertex V of Λ, the vertex group Λ(V), has a graph of groups decomposition ΦV such that each vertex group of ΦV is either

(1) conjugate to a vertex group of Ψ or

(2) a subgroup of vΛ(E)v- 1 for some v∈Λ(V) and E some edge of Λ adjacent to V.

When Ψ is visual, vertex groups of the first type in theorem [\ref=artificial] are visual and those of the second type seem somewhat artificial. In section 4 we prove theorem [\ref=T1N] which shows that if the edge groups of the decomposition Λ in theorem [\ref=artificial] are minimal splitting subgroups of W, then the decompositions ΦV are compatible with Λ and part (2) of the conclusion can be significantly enhanced.

If Λ is a reduced graph of groups decomposition of a group G, V and U are vertices of Λ and gΛ(V)g- 1  ⊂  Λ(U) for some g∈G, then V = U. If additionally Λ is a tree, then g∈Λ(V). [formula]

If W is a finitely generated Coxeter group then since W has a set of order 2 generators, there is no non-trivial homomorphism from W to [formula]. Hence any graph of groups decomposition of W is a tree. If C∈M(W) and W is finitely generated, then theorem [\ref=MT1] implies that C contains a subgroup of finite index which is isomorphic to a Coxeter group and so there is no non-trivial homomorphism of C to [formula].

The following is an easy exercise in the theory of graph of groups or more practically it is a direct consequence of the exactness of the Mayer-Viatoris sequence for a pair of groups.

Suppose the group W decomposes as [formula] and there is no non-trivial homomorphism of W or C to [formula]. Then there is no non-trivial homomorphism of A or B to [formula]. [formula]

Suppose W is a finitely generated Coxeter group and Λ is a graph of groups decomposition of W with each edge group in M(W), then any graph of groups decomposition of a vertex group of Λ is a tree. [formula]

Preliminary results

We list some results used in this paper. Most can be found in [\cite=Bourbaki].

Suppose (W,S) is a Coxeter system and P = 〈S:(st)m(s,t) for m(s,t) <   ∞  〉 (where [formula] ) is a Coxeter presentation for W. If A is a subset of S, then (〈A〉,A) is a Coxeter system with Coxeter presentation 〈A:(st)m'(s,t) for m'(s,t)  <    ∞  〉 (where m' = m|A2). In particular, if {s,t}  ⊂  S, then the order of (st) is m(s,t). [formula]

The following result is due to Tits:

Suppose (W,S) is a Coxeter system and F is a finite subgroup of W then there is A  ⊂  S such that 〈A〉 is finite and some conjugate of F is a subgroup of 〈A〉. [formula]

If A is a set of generators for a group G, the Cayley graph K(G,A) of G with respect to A has G as vertex set and a directed edge labeled a from g∈G to ga for each a∈A. The group G acts on the left of K. Given a vertex g in K, the edge paths in K at g are in 1-1 correspondence with the words in the letters A±  1 where the letter a- 1 is used if an edge labeled a is traversed opposite its orientation. Note that for a Coxeter system (W,S), and s∈S, s = s- 1. It is standard to identify the edges labeled s at x and s at xs in K(W,S) for each vertex x, of K and each s∈S and to ignore the orientation on the edges. Given a group G with generators A, an A-geodesic for g∈G is a shortest word in the letters A±  1 whose product is g. A geodesic for G defines a geodesic in K for each vertex g∈G. Cayley graphs provide and excellent geometric setting for many of the results in this section.

The next result is called the deletion condition for Coxeter groups. An elementary proof of this fact, based on Dehn diagrams, can be found in [\cite=MTVisual].

The Deletion Condition Suppose (W,S) is a Coxeter system and [formula] is a word in S which is not geodesic. Then for some i < j, [formula]. I.e. the letters ai and aj can be deleted. [formula]

The next collection of lemmas can be derived from the deletion condition.

Suppose (W,S) is a Coxeter system and A and B are subsets of S. Then for any w∈W there is a unique shortest element, d, of the double coset 〈A〉w〈B〉. If δ is a geodesic for d, α is an A-geodesic, and β is a B-geodesic, then (α,δ) and (δ,β) are geodesic. [formula]

Suppose (W,S) is a Coxeter system, w∈W, I and J  ⊂  S, and d is the minimal length double coset representative in 〈I〉w〈J〉. Then [formula] for [formula] and, [formula] for [formula]. In particular, if w = idj for i∈〈I〉 and j∈〈J〉 then [formula] and [formula]. [formula]

Suppose (W,S) is a Coxeter system, A is a subset of S and α is an S-geodesic. If for each letter a∈A, the word (α,a) is not geodesic, then the group 〈A〉 is finite. [formula]

Suppose (W,S) is a Coxeter system and x∈S. If α is a geodesic in S - {x}, then the word (α,x) is geodesic. [formula]

If (W,S) is a Coxeter system and w∈W then the deletion condition implies that the letters of S used to compose an S-geodesic for w is independent of which geodesic one composes for w. We define lett(w)S to be the subset of S used to composes a geodesic for w, or when the system is evident we simply write lett(w).

Suppose (W,S) is a Coxeter system, w∈W, b∈S - lett(w), and bwb∈〈lett(w)〉 then b commutes with lett(w).[formula]

The next lemma is technical but critical to the main results of the section.

Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system and A  ⊂  S such that 〈A〉 is infinite and there is no non-trivial F  ⊂  A such that 〈F〉 is finite and A - F commutes with F. Then there is an infinite A-geodesic α, such that each letter of A appears infinitely many times in α.

The case when 〈A〉 does not (visually) decompose as 〈A - U〉  ×  〈U〉 for any non-trivial U  ⊂  A, follows from lemma 1.15 of [\cite=MRT]. The general case follows since once the irreducible case is established, one can interleave geodesics from each (infinite) factor of a maximal visual direct product decomposition of 〈A〉. I.e. if 〈A〉  =  〈A - U〉  ×  〈U〉, [formula] and [formula] are U and A - U-geodesics respectively, then the deletion condition implies [formula] is an A-geodesic.

Observe that if (W,S) is a Coxeter system, and W = 〈F〉  ×  〈G〉  =  〈H〉  ×  〈I〉 for [formula]. Then [formula] and [formula]. In particular, for A  ⊂  S, there is a unique largest subset C  ⊂  A such that 〈A〉  =  〈A - C〉  ×  〈C〉 and 〈C〉 is finite. Define [formula] and [formula]. When the system is evident we simply write TW(A) and EW(A).

For a Coxeter system (W,S) and A  ⊂  S, let lk2(A,(W,S)) (the 2-link of A in the system (W,S)) be the set of all s∈S - A that commute with A. For consistency we define [formula]. When the system is evident we simply write lk2(A). In the presentation diagram Γ(W,S), lk2(A) is the set of all vertices s∈S such that s is connected to each element of A by an edge labeled 2.

If G is a group with generating set S and u is an S-word, denote by ū the element of G represented by u.

Suppose (W,S) is a Coxeter system, A  ⊂  S, and r is an A-geodesic such that each letter of A appears infinitely often in r. If r can be partitioned as [formula] and w∈W is such that wiw- 1 = si, |si|  =  |i|, and [formula] and [formula] are geodesic for all i where β is a geodesic for w, then [formula].

If w is a minimum length counter-example, then by lemma [\ref=L56], |w| > 1. Say [formula] is a geodesic for w. For all m, [formula] is not geodesic and the last wn deletes with one of the initial wi. For some [formula], there are infinitely many m such that the last wn deletes with wi. Say this set of such m is [formula] (in ascending order). Then wn commutes with [formula] for all j. By lemma [\ref=L56], [formula]. Then [formula] is shorter than w and satisfies the hypothesis of the lemma with r replaced by [formula] where [formula]. By the minimality of w , [formula], and so [formula].

The next result is analogous to classical results (see V. Deodhar [\cite=Deodhar]).

Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system, A and B are subsets of S, u is a shortest element of the double coset 〈B〉g〈A〉, and g〈A〉g- 1  ⊂  〈B〉. Then uAu- 1  ⊂  B and lett(u)  ⊂  lk2(EW(A)). In particular, uxu- 1 = x for all x∈EW(A) and EW(A)  ⊂  EW(B). If additionally, g〈A〉g- 1  =  〈B〉, then uAu- 1 = B and EW(A) = EW(B).

Note that g〈A〉g- 1 = bua〈A〉a- 1u- 1b- 1  ⊂  〈B〉 for some a∈〈A〉 and b∈〈B〉. Then u〈A〉u- 1  ⊂  〈B〉. By lemma [\ref=Kil], [formula] and so [formula] and A  ⊂  u- 1Bu so that uAu- 1  ⊂  B.

If [formula] there is nothing more to prove. Otherwise, lemma [\ref=L56] implies there is a geodesic α in the letters of EW(A), such that each letter of EW(A) appears infinitely often in α. By lemma [\ref=Fin2] (with partitioning ri of length 1), [formula]. By the definition of u, no geodesic for u can end in a letter of A and so lett(u)  ⊂  lk2(EW(A)). Then EW(A)  ⊂  B so EW(A)  ⊂  EW(B).

Now assume g〈A〉g- 1  =  〈B〉. Then as u- 1 is the shortest element of the double coset 〈A〉g- 1〈B〉, we have u- 1Bu  ⊂  A so uAu- 1 = B, and we have EW(B)  ⊂  EW(A) so EW(A) = EW(B).

Suppose (W,S) is a Coxeter system, B is an infinite subgroup of W and A  ⊂  S such that 〈A〉 has finite index in B. Then B = 〈A0〉  ×  C for A0  ⊂  A and C a finite subgroup of 〈lk2(A0)〉. (By lemma [\ref=Tits], C is a subgroup of a finite group 〈D〉 such that D  ⊂  S - A0 and D commutes with A0.)

Let [formula]. By lemma [\ref=L54] there is an infinite-length A0-geodesic r, such that each letter in A0 appears infinitely often in r. The group 〈A0〉 contains a subgroup A' which is a normal finite-index subgroup of B. Let αi be the initial segment of r of length i, and Ci the B / A' coset containing i, the element of W represented by αi. Let i be the first integer such that Ci = Cj for infinitely many j. Replace r by the terminal segment of r that follows αi. Then r can be partitioned into geodesics [formula] such that i∈A'. Hence for any i and any b∈B, bib- 1∈A'  ⊂  〈A0〉.

It suffices to show that B  ⊂  〈A0〉  ×  〈lk2(A0)〉, since then each b∈B is such that b = xy with x∈〈A0〉 and y∈〈lk2(A0)〉. As A0  ⊂  B, y∈B and so [formula]. (Recall 〈A0〉 has finite index in B.)

Suppose b is a shortest element of B such that [formula]. Let β be a geodesic for b.

Claim The path [formula] is geodesic.

Proof: Otherwise let i be the first integer such that (β,αi) (recall αi is the initial segment of r of length i) is not geodesic. Then i  =  i - 1 where γ is obtained from β by deleting some letter and (γ,αi - 1) is geodesic. We have i - 1 = bi, and {b,i - 1,i}  ⊂  B, so ∈B.

We conclude the proof of this claim by showing: If b is a shortest element of B such that [formula] and β is a geodesic for b, then a letter cannot be deleted from β to give a geodesic for an element of B.

Otherwise, suppose [formula], [formula] is geodesic, and ∈B. By the minimality hypothesis, [formula]. "Sliding" lk2(A0)-letters of β before bi "back" and those after bi "forward", gives a geodesic (β1,β2,bi,β3,β4) for b, with [formula] and [formula]. Now, [formula], for each j. This implies [formula]. For large j, [formula]. By lemma [\ref=L56], [formula], and so [formula]. This is contrary to our assumption and the claim is proved. [formula]

The same proof shows [formula] is geodesic for all k.

Let δi be a geodesic for bib- 1∈〈A0〉. Next we show |δi|  =  |ri|. As (β,ri) is geodesic and bi  =  ib, |δi|  ≥  |ri|. If |δi|  >  |ri| then (δi,β) is not geodesic. Say [formula] for xi∈A0. Let j be the largest integer such that [formula] is not geodesic. Then xj deletes with say bi and [formula] is geodesic. As

[formula]

the word [formula] is a geodesic for an element of B. This is impossible by the closing argument of our claim.

Since [formula] is geodesic for all i, so is [formula]. Since

[formula]

the claim shows [formula] is geodesic for all i. The proposition now follows directly from lemma [\ref=Fin2].

Minimal Splittings

Recall that a subgroup A of W is a minimal splitting subgroup of W if W splits non-trivially over A, and there is no subgroup B of W such that W splits non-trivially over B, and [formula] has infinite index in A and finite index in B.

For a Coxeter system (W,S) we defined M(W) to be the collection of minimal splitting subgroups groups of W. Observe that if W has more than 1-end, then each member of M(W) is a finite group. Define K(W,S) to be the set of all subgroups of W of the form 〈A〉  ×  M for A  ⊂  S, and M a subgroup of a finite special subgroup of 〈lk2(A)〉 (including when 〈A〉 and/or M is trivial). If W is finitely generated, then K(W,S) is finite.

Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system and Λ is a non-trivial reduced graph of groups decomposition of W such that each edge group of Λ is in M(W). If Ψ is a reduced visual graph of groups decomposition for W such that each edge group of Ψ is conjugate to a subgroup of Λ then each edge group of Ψ is in M(W). [formula]

Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system and G is a group in M(W). Then G is conjugate to a group in K(W,S).

By theorem [\ref=MT1], there is E  ⊂  S and w∈W such that W splits non-trivially over E and w〈E〉w- 1 is conjugate to a subgroup of G. By the minimality of G, 〈E〉 has finite index in w- 1Gw and the lemma follows from theorem [\ref=Index].

Consider the Coxeter system (W,S) with S = {a,b,c,d,x,y}, m(u,v) = 2 if u∈{a,c,d} and v∈{x,y}, m(a,b) = m(b,c) = 2, m(c,d) = 3, m(x,b) = m(y,b) = 3 and m(x,y) = m(a,c) = m(a,d) = m(b,d) =   ∞  . The group W is 1-ended since no subset of S separates the presentation diagram Γ(W,S) and also generates a finite group. The group 〈x,c,y〉 is a member of M(W), since it is 2-ended and {x,c,y} separates Γ. The set {x,y,b} separates Γ, but [formula] since 〈x,y〉 has finite index in 〈x,c,y〉 and infinite index in 〈x,b,y〉. Note that no subset of {x,b,y} generates a group in M(W).

The element cd conjugates {x,c,y} to {x,d,y}. So, 〈x,d,y〉∈M(W). Hence a visual subgroup in M(W) need not separate Γ(W,S).

Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system and [formula] is a non-trivial splitting of W. Then there exists D  ⊂  S and w∈W such that 〈D〉∈M(W), D separates Γ(W,S) and w〈EW(D)〉w- 1  ⊂  C (so [formula] has finite index in w〈D〉w- 1). Furthermore, if C∈M(W) then w〈EW(D)〉w- 1 has finite index in C.

The second part of this follows trivially from the definition of M(W) and theorem [\ref=MT1]. Let Ψ1 be a reduced visual graph of groups decomposition for [formula]. Each edge group of Ψ1 is a subgroup of a conjugate of C. Say D1  ⊂  S and 〈D1〉 is an edge group of Ψ1. Then W splits non-trivially as [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. If 〈D1〉 is not in M(W), there exists C1 a subgroup of W, such that W splits non-trivially as [formula] and such that [formula] has infinite index in 〈D1〉 and finite index in C1. Let Ψ2 be a reduced visual decomposition for [formula], and D2  ⊂  S such that 〈D2〉 is an edge group of Ψ2. Then a conjugate of 〈D2〉 is a subgroup of C1, and [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. For i∈{1,2}, 〈Di〉  =  〈Ui〉  ×  〈Vi〉 where Ui = EW(Di) and Vi = TW(Di) (so by remark [\ref=Split], [formula] and Vi is the (unique) largest such subset of Di such that 〈Vi〉 is finite).

It suffices to show that U2 is a proper subset of U1. Choose g∈W such that g〈D2〉g- 1  ⊂  C1. Then by lemma [\ref=Kil], [formula] for d∈〈D1〉 and [formula] where m is the minimal length double coset representative of 〈D1〉g〈D2〉. Write 〈K〉  =  〈U3〉  ×  〈V3〉 with U3 = EW(K) and V3 = TW(K). As K  ⊂  D1, EW(K)  ⊂  EW(D1), so U3  ⊂  U1. As m- 1Km  ⊂  D2, lemma [\ref=LFin] implies EW(K)  ⊂  EW(D2) so U3  ⊂  U2. Hence [formula]. Since [formula] has infinite index in 〈D1〉, d〈K〉d- 1 has infinite index in 〈D1〉. As d1∈〈D1〉, 〈K〉 has infinite index in 〈D1〉. Hence U3 is a proper subset of U1.

Recall that g〈D2〉g- 1  ⊂  C1 and [formula] has finite index in C1 so [formula] has finite index in g〈D2〉g- 1 and g- 1d〈U3〉d- 1g has finite index in 〈D2〉. Thus, for u the minimal length double coset representative of 〈D2〉g- 1d〈U3〉, u〈U3〉u- 1 has finite index in 〈D2〉.

Since EW(U3) = U3, lemma [\ref=LFin] implies U3 = uU3u- 1  ⊂  D2. Hence 〈U3〉 has finite index in 〈U2〉. By proposition [\ref=Index], 〈U2〉  =  〈U3〉  ×  C for C a finite subgroup of 〈lk2(U3)〉. If s∈U2 - U3 then as [formula], s∈lk2(U3). Hence 〈U2〉  =  〈U3〉  ×  〈U2 - U3〉. As 〈U3〉 has finite index in 〈U2〉, 〈U2 - U3〉 is finite. By the definition of U2, U2 = U3 and so U2 is a proper subset of U1.

We can now easily recognize separating special subgroups in M(W).

Suppose (W,S) is a Coxeter system and C  ⊂  S separates Γ(W,S). Then 〈C〉∈M(W) iff there is no D  ⊂  S such that D separates Γ(W,S) and EW(D) is a proper subset of EW(C).

If 〈C〉∈M(W), D  ⊂  S such that D separates Γ and EW(D) is a proper subset of EW(C), then by proposition [\ref=Index], 〈EW(D)〉 has infinite index in 〈EW(C)〉. But then [formula] has finite index in 〈D〉 and infinite index in 〈C〉, contrary to the assumption 〈C〉∈M(W).

If [formula], then by proposition [\ref=L24N], there is D  ⊂  S and w∈W such that 〈D〉∈M(W), D separates Γ, and w〈EW(D)〉w- 1  ⊂  〈C〉. By lemma [\ref=LFin], EW(D)  ⊂  EW(C). Since [formula], EW(D) is a proper subset of EW(C).

Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system, Λ is a reduced graph of groups decomposition for W with each edge group a minimal splitting subgroup of W, and Ψ is a reduced graph of groups decomposition of W such that each vertex group of Ψ is conjugate to a subgroup of a vertex group of Λ and for each edge E of Λ, there is an edge D of Ψ such that Ψ(D) is conjugate to a subgroup of Λ(E). (E.g. if Ψ is a visual decomposition from Λ.) If A is a vertex of Λ, and ΦA is the reduced decomposition of Λ(A) given by the action of Λ(A) on the Bass-Serre tree for Ψ, then

1) For each edge E of Λ adjacent to A, Λ(E)  ⊂  aΦA(K)a- 1, for some a∈Λ(A) and some vertex K of ΦA. In particular, the decomposition ΦA is compatible with Λ.

2) Each vertex group of ΦA is conjugate to a vertex group of Ψ (and so is Coxeter), or is Λ(A)-conjugate to Λ(E) for some edge E adjacent to A.

3) If each edge group of Ψ is in M(W), then each edge group of ΦA is a minimal splitting subgroup of W.

Suppose E is an edge of Λ adjacent to A. By hypothesis, there is an edge D of Ψ and w∈W such that wΨ(D)w- 1  ⊂  Λ(E). Since Λ(E) is minimal, Ψ(D) has finite index in w- 1Λ(E)w and so corollary 4.8 of [\cite=DicksDunwoody] implies Λ(E) stabilizes a vertex of TΨ, the Bass-Serre tree for Ψ. Thus Λ(E) is a subgroup of aΦA(K)a- 1, for some vertex K of ΦA, and some a∈Λ(A). Part 1) is proved.

By theorem [\ref=artificial], each vertex group of ΦA is either conjugate to a vertex group of Ψ or Λ(A)-conjugate to a subgroup of an edge group Λ(E), for some edge E of Λ adjacent to A. Suppose Q is a vertex of ΦA and a1ΦA(Q)a- 11  ⊂  Λ(E) for some a1∈Λ(A). By part 1), Λ(E)  ⊂  a2ΦA(K)a- 12, for some a2∈Λ(A) and K a vertex of ΦA. Thus, a1ΦA(Q)a- 11  ⊂  Λ(E)  ⊂  a2ΦA(K)a- 12. Lemma [\ref=Sub] implies Q = K and a- 12a1∈ΦA(Q), so ΦA(Q) = a- 12Λ(E)a2 and part 2) is proved.

By part 1) W splits non-trivially over each edge group of ΦA and part 3) follows.

Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system, Λ is a reduced graph of groups decomposition of W and E is an edge of Λ such that Λ(E) is conjugate to a group in K(W,S). Then there is Q  ⊂  S such that a conjugate of 〈Q〉 is a subgroup of a vertex group of Λ and a conjugate of Λ(E) has finite index in 〈Q〉.

The group Λ(E) is conjuate to 〈B〉  ×  F for B  ⊂  S and F  ⊂  〈D〉 where D  ⊂  lk2(B) and 〈D〉 is finite. Let TΛ be the Bass-Serre tree for Λ and set [formula]. It suffices to show that [formula] stabilizes a vertex of TΛ. Otherwise, let [formula] be large as possible so that [formula] stabilizes a vertex of TΛ. As [formula] is finite, it stabilizes some vertex V1 of TΛ. The group 〈B〉 stabilizes a vertex V2 of TΛ and [formula] stabilizes a vertex V3 of TΛ. Since TΛ is a tree, there is a vertex V4 common to the three TΛ-geodesics connecting pairs of vertices in {V1,V2,V3}. Then [formula] stabilizes V4, contrary to the minimality of i. Instead, [formula] stabilizes a vertex of TΛ.

The next result combines theorem [\ref=T1N] and proposition [\ref=P2N] to show that any graph of groups decomposition of a Coxeter group with edge groups equal to minimal splitting subgroups of the Coxeter group is, up to "artificial considerations", visual.

Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system, Λ is a reduced graph of groups decomposition for W with each edge group a minimal splitting subgroup of W, and Ψ is a reduced visual decomposition from Λ. If Φ' is the graph of groups obtained from Λ by replacing each vertex A of Λ by ΦA, the graph of groups decomposition of Λ(A) given by the action of Λ(A) on the Bass-Serre tree for Ψ, and Φ is obtained by reducing Φ', then there is a bijection τ, from the vertices of Φ to those of Ψ so that for each vertex V of Φ, Ψ(τ(V)) is conjugate to Φ(V).

Part 1) of theorem [\ref=T1N] implies the decomposition Φ is well-defined. If Q is a vertex of Ψ then a conjugate of Ψ(Q) is a subgroup of Λ(B) for some vertex B of Λ, and corollary 7 of [\cite=MTVisual] (an elementary corollary of theorem [\ref=artificial]) implies this conjugate of Ψ(Q) is a vertex group of ΦB. Hence each vertex group of Ψ is conjugate to a vertex group of Φ'. Suppose A is a vertex of Λ and U is a vertex of ΦA such that ΦA(U) is Λ(A)-conjugate to Λ(E) for some edge E adjacent to A. If Λ(E) is not conjugate to a special subgroup of (W,S), then as Λ(E) is conjugate to a group in K(W,S), proposition [\ref=P2N] implies there is a vertex V of Λ and a vertex group of ΦV properly containing a conjugate of Λ(E). Hence ΦA(U) is eliminated by reduction when Φ is formed. If Λ(E) is conjugate to a special subgroup of (W,S), then as Λ(E) is also conjugate to a subgroup of a vertex group of Ψ, either Λ(E) is conjugate to a vertex group of Ψ or Λ(E) is eliminated by reduction when Φ is formed. Hence by part 2) of theorem [\ref=T1N], every vertex group of Φ is conjugate to a vertex group of Ψ. No two vertex groups of Ψ are conjugate, so if V is a vertex of Φ, let τ(V) be the unique vertex of Ψ such that Φ(V) is conjugate to Ψ(τ(V)). As no two vertex groups of Φ are conjugate, τ is injective. If Q is a vertex of Ψ, then as noted above Ψ(Q) is conjugate to a vertex group of Φ' and so Ψ(Q)  ⊂  wΦ(V)w- 1 for some w∈W and V a vertex of Φ. Choose x∈W such that Φ(V) = xΨ(τ(V))x- 1. Then Ψ(Q)  ⊂  wxΨ(τ(V))x- 1w- 1. Lemma [\ref=Sub] implies Q = τ(V) and so τ is onto.

In the previous argument it is natural to wonder if a vertex group of Ψ might be conjugate to a vertex group of ΦA and to a vertex group of ΦB for A and B distinct vertices of Λ. Certainly such a group would be conjugate to an edge group of Λ. The next example show this can indeed occur.

Consider the Coxeter presentation 〈a,b,c,d: a2 = b2 = c2 = d2 = 1〉. Define Λ to be the graph of groups decomposition [formula]. Then Λ has graph with a vertex A and Λ(A) = 〈a,cdc〉, edge C with Λ(C) = 〈cdc〉 vertex B with Λ(B) = 〈b,cdc〉 edge E with Λ(E) trivial and vertex D with Λ(D) = 〈d〉. The visual decomposition for Λ is [formula], a graph of groups decomposition with each vertex group isomorphic to [formula] and each edge group trivial. Now ΦA has decomposition [formula], ΦB has decomposition [formula] and ΦD has decomposition 〈d〉. Observe that the Ψ vertex group 〈d〉 is conjugate to a vertex group of both ΦA and ΦB. The group Φ of the previous theorem would have decomposition [formula].

Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system and C is a subgroup of W conjugate to a group in K(W,S). If D is a subgroup of W and wDw- 1  ⊂  C  ⊂  D for some w∈W, then wDw- 1 = C = D.

Conjugating we may assume C = 〈U〉  ×  F, for U  ⊂  S, EW(U) = U and F a finite group. Let K  ⊂  lk2(U) such that 〈K〉 is finite and F  ⊂  〈K〉. Now, [formula]. Write w = xdy for [formula], y∈〈U〉, and d the minimal length double coset representative of [formula]. Then dCd- 1  ⊂  dDd- 1  ⊂  x- 1Cx. By lemma [\ref=LFin], dUd- 1 = U and by the definition of x, x- 1〈U〉x = 〈U〉. The index of 〈U〉 in dCd- 1 is |F| and the index of 〈U〉 in x- 1Cx is |F|. Hence dCd- 1 = dDd- 1 = x- 1Cx and wCw- 1 = wDw- 1 = C.

The argument in the first paragraph below shows that if Λ is a reduced graph of groups decomposition of a Coxeter group W, V is a vertex of Λ and Φ is a reduced graph of groups decomposition of Λ(V), compatible with Λ then when replacing V by Φ to form Λ1, no vertex group of Φ is W-conjugate to a subgroup of another vertex group of Φ. In particular, each edge of Φ survives reduction in Λ1.

Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system and Λ is a reduced graph of groups decomposition of W with M(W) edge groups. Suppose a vertex group of Λ splits nontriviall and compatibly as [formula] over an M(W) group C. Then there is a group in K(W,S) contained in a conjugate of B which is not also contained in a conjugate of A (and then also with A and B reversed).

Let V be the vertex group such that Λ(V) splits as [formula] and let Λ1 be the graph of groups resulting from replacing Λ(V) by this splitting. If there is w∈W such that wBw- 1  ⊂  A, then (by considering the Bass-Serre tree for Λ1) a W-conjugate of B is a subgroup of C. Lemma [\ref=Kequal] then implies B = C, which is nonsense. Hence no W-conjugate of B (respectively A) is a subgroup of A (respectively B). This implies that if Λ2 is obtained by reducing Λ1, then there is an edge [formula] of Λ2 with vertices Ā and [formula], such that Λ2() = C, and Λ2(Ā) is Â where Â is either A or a vertex group (other than Λ1(V)) of Λ1 containing A as a subgroup. Similarly for Λ2().

If B collapses across an edge of Λ1 then B is conjugate to a group in K(W,S) and B satisfies the conclusion of the proposition. If B does not collapse across an edge of Λ1 (so that B̂ = B), then let ΦB be the reduced graph of groups decomposition of B induced from the action of B on Ψ, the visual decomposition of W from Λ2. By theorem [\ref=T1N], each vertex group of ΦB is conjugate to a group in K(W,S) and the decomposition ΦB is compatible with Λ2. Let Λ3 be the graph of groups decomposition of W obtained from Λ2 by replacing the vertex for B by ΦB. In Λ3, the edge [formula] connects the vertex Ā to say the ΦB-vertex [formula]. If Λ3() is not conjugate to a subgroup of A, then Λ3() satisfies the conclusion of our proposition. Otherwise, (as before) lemma [\ref=Kequal] implies Λ3() = Λ3() and we collapse [formula] across [formula] to form Λ4. Note that if [formula] does collapse, then ΦB has more than one vertex. There is an edge of Λ4 (with edge group some subgroup of C which is also an edge group of ΦB) separating the vertex Ā from some vertex K of ΦB. The group Λ4(K) satisfies the conclusion of the proposition, since otherwise a W-conjugate of Λ4(K) is a subgroup of A. But then lemma [\ref=Kequal] implies Λ4(K) is equal to an edge group of ΦB which is impossible.

Proposition [\ref=Kreduce] is the last result of this section needed to prove our main theorem. The remainder of the section is devoted to proving theorem [\ref=vismin], a minimal splitting version of the visual decomposition theorem of [\cite=MTVisual]. In order to separate this part of the paper from the rest, some lemmas are listed here that could have been presented in earlier sections. The next lemma follows directly from theorem [\ref=Index].

Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system and A  ⊂  S. If B is a proper subset of E(A) then 〈B〉 has infinite index in 〈E(A)〉. [formula]

Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system, A and B are subsets of S such that 〈A〉 and 〈B〉 are elements of M(W). If E(A)  ⊂  B then E(A) = E(B).

If E(A)  ⊂  B, then the definitions of E(A) and E(B), imply E(A)  ⊂  E(B). As 〈B〉∈M(W), lemma [\ref=properE] implies E(A) is not a proper subset of E(B).

Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system, C  ⊂  S is such that 〈C〉∈M(W) and C separates Γ(W,S). If K  ⊂  S is a component of Γ - C, then for each c∈E(C), there is an edge connecting c to K.

Otherwise, C - {c} separates Γ. This is impossible by lemma [\ref=properE] and the fact that 〈C〉∈M(W).

In the remainder of this section we simplify notation for visual graph of groups decompositions by labeling each vertex of such a graph by A, where A  ⊂  S and 〈A〉 is the vertex group. It is possible for two distinct edges of such a decomposition to have the same edge groups so we do not extend this labeling to edges.

Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system and Ψ is a reduced (W,S)-visual graph of groups decomposition with M(W)-edge groups. If A  ⊂  S is a vertex of Ψ, and M  ⊂  S is such that 〈M〉∈M(W), M separates Γ(W,S) and E(M)  ⊂  A, then

1) either E(M) = E(C) for some C  ⊂  S and 〈C〉 the edge group of an edge of Ψ adjacent to A, or M  ⊂  A and M separates A in Γ, and

2) for each C  ⊂  S such that 〈C〉 is the edge group of an edge of Ψ adjacent to A, C - M is a subset of a component of Γ - M.

In particular, if E(M)  ≠  E(C) for each C  ⊂  S such that 〈C〉 is the edge group of an edge adjacent to A in Ψ, then 〈A〉 visually splits over 〈M〉, compatibly with Ψ, such that each vertex group of the splitting is generated by M union the intersection of A with a component of Γ - M.

First we show that if [formula], then E(M) = E(C) for some C such that 〈C〉 is the edge group of an edge adjacent to A in Ψ. If [formula] then 〈M〉 is finite and [formula] for every C  ⊂  S such that 〈C〉∈M(W). Hence we may assume [formula]. As E(M)  ⊂  A, there is m∈M - E(M) such that [formula]. Say m∈B for B  ⊂  S a vertex of Ψ. If E is the first edge of the Ψ-geodesic from A to B and Ψ(E) = C, then [formula]. But in Γ, there is an edge between m and each vertex of E(M). Hence E(M)  ⊂  C and lemma [\ref=minequiv] implies E(M) = E(C).

To complete part 1), it suffices to show that if E(M)  ≠  E(C) for all C  ⊂  S such that 〈C〉 is the edge group of an edge of Ψ adjacent to the vertex A of Ψ, then M separates A in Γ. We have shown that M  ⊂  A. Write [formula] where C  ⊂  S is such that 〈C〉  =  Ψ(E) for E an edge of Ψ adjacent to A, and BC (respectively DC) the union of the S-generators of vertex groups for all vertices of Ψ on the side of E opposite A (respectively, on the same side of C as A). In particular, M  ⊂  DC and [formula]. Then BC is the union of C and some of the components of Γ - C (and DC is the union of C and the rest of the components of Γ - C). By lemma [\ref=minequiv], [formula]. Choose c∈E(C) - M. If B' is a component of Γ - C and B'  ⊂  BC, then by lemma [\ref=connect], there is an edge of Γ connecting c and B'. Hence [formula] for some component KC of Γ - M. In particular, [formula]. Also note that if c'∈C - M then either c'∈E(C) - M or there is an edge of Γ connecting c' to c. In either case c'∈KC and [formula].

For [formula], let Ei be the edges of Ψ adjacent to A and let 〈Ci〉  =  Ψ(Ei) for Ci  ⊂  S. Since 〈A〉 is a vertex group of Ψ, [formula]. We have argued that there is [formula] for the component KCi of Γ - M. If KCi  ≠  KCj, then M separates the points ci and cj of A, in Γ. If all KCi are equal (e.g. when n = 1), then Γ - KCi  ⊂  A. Since M separates Γ, [formula], so M separates ci from a point of [formula]. In any case part 1) is proved.

Part 2): As noted above, if E(M)  ≠  E(C), then for any C  ⊂  S such that 〈C〉 is the edge group of an edge of Ψ adjacent to A we have [formula] for KC a component of Γ - M and BC some subset of S. If E(M) = E(C) then 〈C - M〉 is finite, so C - M is a complete subset of Γ and hence a subset of a component of Γ - M.

The next result is a minimal splitting version of the visual decomposition theorem. While part 2) of the conclusion is slightly weaker than the corresponding conclusion of the visual decomposition theorem, part 3) ensures that all edge groups of a given graph of groups decomposition of a finitely generated Coxeter group are "refined" by minimal visual edge groups of a visual decomposition. The example following the proof of this theorem shows that part 2) cannot be strengthened.

Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system and Λ is a reduced graph of groups decomposition for W. There is a reduced visual decomposition Ψ of W such that

1) each vertex group of Ψ is a subgroup of a conjugate of a vertex group of Λ,

2) if D is an edge of Ψ then either Ψ(D) is conjugate to a subgroup of an edge group of Λ, or Ψ(D) is a minimal splitting subgroup for W and a visual subgroup of finite index in Ψ(D) is conjugate to a subgroup of an edge group of Λ.

3) for each edge E of Λ there is an edge D of Ψ such that Ψ(D) is a minimal splitting subgroup for W, and a visual subgroup of finite index of Ψ(D) is conjugate to a subgroup of Λ(E).

Let C1 be an edge group of Λ. By proposition [\ref=L24N] there exists M1  ⊂  S and w∈W such that 〈M1〉∈M(W), M1 separates Γ(W,S) and [formula] has finite index in w〈M1〉w- 1. Then W visually splits as [formula] (so [formula], [formula], and A1 is the union of M1 and some of the components of Γ - M1 and B1 is M1 union the other components of Γ - M1). Suppose C2 is an edge group of Λ other than C1. Then [formula] where K2 and L2 are the subgroups of W generated by the vertex groups of Λ on opposite sides of C2. Let T2 be the Bass-Serre tree for this splitting.

Suppose 〈A1〉 and 〈B1〉 stabilize the vertices X1 and Y1 respectively of T2. Then X1  ≠  Y1, since W is not a subgroup of a conjugate of K2 or L2. Now, 〈M1〉 stabilizes the T2-geodesic connecting X1 and Y1 and so 〈M1〉 is a subgroup of a conjugate of C2. In this case we define [formula].

If 〈A1〉 does not stabilize a vertex of T2 then there is a non-trivial visual decomposition Φ1 of 〈A1〉 from its action on T2 as given by the visual decomposition theorem. Since a conjugate of [formula] has finite index in 〈M1〉 and at the same time stabilizes a conjugate of a vertex group of Λ (and hence a vertex of T2), corollary 4.8 of [\cite=DicksDunwoody] implies 〈M1〉 stabilizes a vertex of T2, and so Φ1 is visually compatible with the visual splitting [formula]. If 〈E2〉 is an edge group of Φ1, then a conjugate of 〈E2〉 is a subgroup of C2. By corollary [\ref=C7], there is M2  ⊂  S such that M2 separates Γ(W,S), 〈M2〉∈M(W) and E(M2)  ⊂  E2 and so 〈E(M2)〉 is a subgroup of a conjugate of C2. If E(M2)  ≠  E(M1), then lemma [\ref=mincompat2] implies M2  ⊂  A1 and 〈A1〉 visually splits over 〈M2〉 compatibly with the splitting Ψ1. Reducing produces a visual decomposition Ψ2. Similarly if 〈A1〉 stabilizes a vertex of T2 and 〈B1〉 does not.

Inductively, assume [formula] are distinct edge groups of Λ, Ψn - 1 is a reduced visual graph of groups decomposition, each edge group of Ψn - 1 is in M(W) and contains a visual subgroup of finite index conjugate to a subgroup of Ci for some 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1, and for each [formula] there is an edge group 〈Mi〉 (Mi  ⊂  S) of Ψn - 1 such that a visual subgroup of finite index of 〈Mi〉 is conjugate to a subgroup of Ci. Write [formula] as above, and let Tn be the Bass-Serre tree for this splitting. Either two adjacent vertex groups of Ψn - 1 stabilize distinct vertices of Tn (in which case we define [formula]) or some vertex Vi  ⊂  S of Ψn - 1 does not stabilize a vertex of Tn. In the latter case 〈Vi〉 visually splits (as above) to give Ψn. Hence, we obtain a reduced visual decomposition Ψ' such that for each edge group 〈M〉 (M  ⊂  S) of Ψ', 〈M〉 is a group in M(W), a subgroup of finite index in 〈M〉 is conjugate to a subgroup of an edge group of Λ, and for each edge D of Λ there is an edge group 〈M〉 of Ψ' such that 〈E(M)〉 (a subgroup of finite index in 〈M〉) is conjugate to a subgroup of Λ(D).

Suppose V  ⊂  S is a vertex of Ψ'. Consider ΦV, the visual decomposition of 〈V〉 from its action on TΛ, the Bass-Serre tree for Λ. If 〈D〉 (D  ⊂  S) is an edge group for an edge of Ψ' adjacent to V, then a subgroup of finite index in 〈D〉 stabilizes a vertex of TΛ. By corollary 4.8 of [\cite=DicksDunwoody], 〈D〉 stabilizes a vertex of TΛ and ΦV is compatible with Ψ'. Replacing each vertex V of Ψ' by ΦV and reducing gives the desired decomposition of W.

The following example exhibits why one cannot expect a stronger version of theorem [\ref=vismin] with visual decomposition Ψ having only minimal edge groups, or so that all minimal edge groups of Ψ are conjugate to subgroups of edge groups of Λ.

Consider the Coxeter presentation 〈a1,a2,a3,a4,a5:a2i = 1,(a1a2)2 = (a2a3)2 = (a3a4)2 = (a4a5)2 = (a5a21) = (a2a5)2 = 1〉 and the splitting [formula]. The subgroup 〈a2,a5〉 is the only minimal visual splitting subgroup for this system, and it is smaller than 〈a2,a4〉. Then no subgroup of 〈a2,a4〉 is a minimal splitting subgroup for our group. The only visual decomposition for this splitting satisfying the conclusion of theorem [\ref=vismin] is: [formula].

Accessibility

We prove prove our main theorem in this section, a strong accessibility result for splittings of Coxeter groups over groups in M(W). For a class of groups V, we call a graph of groups decomposition of a group irreducible with respect to V-splittings if for any vertex group V of the decomposition, every non-trivial splitting of V over a group in V is not compatible with the original graph of groups decomposition.

The following simple example describes a non-trivial compatible splitting of a vertex group of a graph of groups decomposition Λ, of a Coxeter group followed by a reduction to produce a graph of groups with fewer edges than those of Λ. This illustrates potential differences between accessibility and strong accessibility.

[formula]

First consider the splitting of W as:

[formula]

The group 〈s1,s2,s4,s5〉 splits as [formula]. Replacing this group in the above splitting with this amalgamated product and collapsing gives the following decomposition of W:

[formula]

Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system, Ψ is a reduced visual graph of groups decomposition of (W,S), with M(W) edge groups and V is a vertex of Ψ such that Ψ(V) decomposes compatibly as a nontrivial amalgamated product A * CB where C is in M(W). Then Ψ(V) is a nontrivial amalgamated product of special subgroups over an M(W) special subgroup U, with U a subgroup of a conjugate of C, and such that any special subgroup contained in a conjugate of A or B is a subgroup of one of the factors of this visual splitting. In particular, the vertex group Ψ(V) visually splits, compatibly with Ψ, to give a finer visual decomposition of (W,S).

Applying theorem [\ref=MT1] to the amalgamated product [formula], we get that there is a reduced visual graph of groups decomposition Ψ' of Ψ(V) such that each vertex group of Ψ' is a subgroup of a conjugate of A or B and each edge group a subgroup of a conjugate of C. Then Ψ' has more than one vertex since A * CB being nontrivial means Ψ(V) is not a subgroup of a conjugate of A or B. Fix an edge of Ψ', say with edge group U, and collapse the other edges in Ψ' to get a nontrivial visual splitting of Ψ(V) over U a subgroup of a conjugate of C. By theorem [\ref=MT1], a special subgroup of Ψ(V) contained in a conjugate of A or B is contained in a vertex group of Ψ' and so is contained in one of the factors of the resulting visual splitting of Ψ(V) derived from partially collapsing Ψ'. Hence this visual decomposition of Ψ(V) is compatible with Ψ, giving a finer visual decomposition of (W,S). Since C is in M(W) and a conjugate of U is a subgroup of C, U is in M(W).

A visual decomposition Ψ of a Coxeter system (W,S) looks irreducible with respect to M(W) splittings if each edge group of Ψ is in M(W) and for any subset V of S such that 〈V〉 is a vertex group of Ψ, 〈V〉 cannot be split visually, non-trivially and Ψ-compatibly over 〈E〉∈M(W) for E  ⊂  S, to give a finer visual decomposition of W. By lemma [\ref=MT3], it is elementary to see that every finitely generated Coxeter group has a visual decomposition that looks irreducible with respect to M(W) splittings. The following result is a direct consequence of Proposition [\ref=twoendvisualsplit].

A visual decomposition of a Coxeter group looks irreducible with respect to M(W) splittings, iff it is irreducible with respect to M(W) splittings. [formula]

Hence any visual graph of groups decomposition of a Coxeter group with M(W) edge groups can be refined to a visual decomposition that is irreducible with respect to M(W) splittings.

Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system and W is the fundamental group of a graph of groups Λ where each edge group is in M(W). Then W has an irreducible with respect to M(W) splittings visual decomposition Ψ where each vertex group of Ψ is a subgroup of a conjugate of a vertex group of Λ.

Applying theorem [\ref=MT1] to Λ, we get a reduced visual graph of groups Ψ from Λ. If Ψ looks irreducible with respect to M(W) splittings, then we are done. Otherwise, some vertex group of Ψ visually splits nontrivially and compatibly over an M(W) special subgroup and we replace the vertex with this visual splitting in Ψ. We can repeat, replacing some special vertex group by special vertex groups with fewer generators, until we must reach a visual graph of groups which looks irreducible with respect to M(W) splittings.

Theorem [\ref=Close] describes how "close" a decomposition with M(W) edge groups, which is irreducible with respect to M(W) splittings, is to a visual one.

Theorem 2 Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system and Λ is a reduced graph of groups decomposition of W with M(W) edge groups. If Λ is irreducible with respect to M(W) splittings, and Ψ is a reduced graph of groups decomposition such that each edge group of Ψ is in M(S), each vertex group of Ψ is a subgroup of a conjugate of a vertex group of Λ, and each edge group of Λ contains a conjugate of an edge group of Ψ (in particular if Ψ is a reduced visual graph of groups decomposition for (W,S) derived from Λ as in the main theorem of [\cite=MTVisual]), then

Ψ is irreducible with respect to M(W) splittings

There is a (unique) bijection α of the vertices of Λ to the vertices of Ψ such that for each vertex V of Λ, Λ(V) is conjugate to Ψ(α(V))

When Ψ is visual, each edge group of Λ is conjugate to a visual subgroup for (W,S).

Consider a vertex V of Λ with vertex group A = Λ(V). By theorem [\ref=T1N], Λ(V) has a graph of groups decomposition ΦV such that ΦV is compatible with Λ, each edge group of ΦV is in M(W) and each vertex group of ΦV is conjugate to a vertex group of Ψ or conjugate to Λ(E) for some edge E of Λ adjacent to V. Since Λ is reduced and irreducible with respect to M(W) splittings, ΦV has a single vertex and Λ(V) is conjugate to Ψ(V') for some vertex V' of Ψ.

Since no vertex group of Ψ is contained in a conjugate of another, V' is uniquely determined, and we set α(V) = V'. No vertex group of Λ is conjugate to another so α is injective. Since each vertex group Ψ(V') is contained in a conjugate of some Λ(V) which is in turn conjugate to Ψ(α(V)) we must have V' = α(V) and each V' is in the image of α.

If Ψ is not irreducible with respect to M(W) splittings, then it does not look irreducible with respect to M(W) splittings and some vertex group W1 of Ψ visually splits nontrivially and compatibly over an M(W) special subgroup U1. Reducing gives a visual graph of groups decomposition Ψ1 of W satisfying the hypotheses on Ψ in the statement of the theorem. Now W1 is conjugate to a vertex group A of Λ and the above argument shows A is conjugate to a vertex group of Ψ1. But then, W1 is conjugate to a vertex group of Ψ1, which is nonsense. Instead, Ψ is irreducible with respect to M(W) splittings.

Since Λ is a tree, we can take each edge group of Λ as contained in its endpoint vertex groups taken as subgroups of W. Hence each edge group is simply the intersection of its adjacent vertex groups (up to conjugation). Since vertex groups of Λ are conjugates of vertex groups in Ψ, their intersection is conjugate to a special subgroup (by lemma [\ref=Kil]) when Ψ is visual.

Let W have the Coxeter presentation:

[formula]

Then W is 1-ended and has the following visual M(W)-irreducible decomposition (each edge group is 2-ended):

[formula]

There is an automorphism of W sending s5 to s3s5s3 and all other si to themselves. This gives another M(W)-irreducible decomposition of W where the last vertex group 〈s4,s5,s6,s7〉 of the above graph of groups decomposition is replaced by 〈s4,s3s5s3,s6,s7〉. As s3 does not commute with s1 we see that in regard to part 2 of theorem [\ref=Close], a single element of W cannot be expected to conjugate each vertex group of an arbitrary M(W)-irreducible decomposition to a corresponding vertex group of a corresponding visual M(W)-irreducible decomposition.

Theorem 1 Finitely generated Coxeter groups are strongly accessible over minimal splittings.

Suppose (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system. There are only finitely many elements of K(W,S) (which includes the trivial group). For G a subgroup of W let n(G) be the number of elements of K(W,S) which are contained in any conjugate of G (so 1  ≤  n(G)  ≤  n(W)). For Λ a finite graph of groups decomposition of W, let c(Λ) = Σn(W)i = 13ici(Λ) where ci(Λ) is the count of vertex groups G of Λ with n(G) = i.

If Λ reduces to Λ' then clearly ci(Λ')  ≤  ci(Λ) for all i, and for some i, ci(Λ') is strictly less than ci(Λ). Hence, c(Λ') < c(Λ).

If Λ is reduced with M(W) edge groups, and a vertex group G of Λ splits non-trivially and compatibly as A * CB to produce the decomposition Λ' of W, then every subgroup of a conjugate of A or B is a subgroup of a conjugate of G, but, by proposition [\ref=Kreduce], some element of K(W,S) is contained in a conjugate of B, and so of G, but not in a conjugate of A. Hence n(A) < n(G), and similarly n(B) < n(G). This implies that c(Λ') < c(Λ) since cn(G) decreases by 1 in going from Λ to Λ' and the only other ci that change are cn(A) and cn(B), which are both increased by 1 if n(A)  ≠  n(B) and cn(A) increases by 2 if n(A) = n(B), but cn(A) and cn(B) have smaller coefficients than cn(G) in the summation c. More specifically, c(Λ) - c(Λ') = 3n(G) - (3n(A) + 3n(B)) > 0.

If Λ is the trivial decomposition of W, then c(Λ) = 3|K(W,S)| and we define this number to be C(W,S). Suppose [formula] is a sequence of reduced graph of groups decompositions of W with M(W) edge groups, such that Λ1 is the trivial decomposition and Λi is obtained from Λi - 1 by splitting a vertex group G of Λi - 1 non-trivially and compatibly as [formula], for C∈M(W) and then reducing. We have shown that c(Λi) < c(Λi - 1) for all i, and so k  ≤  C(W,S). In particular, W is strongly accessible over M(W) splittings

Generalizations, Ascending HNN extensions (and a group of Thompson) and Closing questions

Recall that if G is a group and H and K are subgroups of G then H is smaller than K if [formula] has finite index in H and infinite index in K. Suppose W is a finitely generated Coxeter group and C is a class of subgroups of W such that for each G∈C, any subgroup of G is in C, e.g. the virtually abelian subgroups of W. Define M(W,C), the minimal C splitting subgroups of W, to be the set of all subgroups H of W such that H∈C, W splits non-trivially over H and for any K∈C such that W splits non-trivially over K, K is not smaller than H. Then the same line of argument as used in this paper shows that W is strongly accessible over M(W,C) splittings.

If (W,S) is a finitely generated Coxeter system and Ψ is an M(W)-irreducible graph of groups decomposition of W with M(W)-edge groups, then by theorem [\ref=Close], each vertex group V of Ψ is a Coxeter group with Coxeter system (V,A) where A is conjugate to a proper subset of S. The collection M(V) is not, in general, a subset of M(W), and so V has an M(V)-irreducible graph of groups decomposition with M(V)-edge groups. As |A|  <  |S|, there cannot be a sequence [formula], with n > |S|, of distinct graph of groups decompositions where Ψ is M(W)-indecomposable with M(W)-edge groups, for i > 0, Vi a vertex group of Ψi - 1 and Ψi is M(Vi)-indecomposable with edge groups in M(Vi). Such a sequence must terminate with a special subgroup of W that has no non-trivial decomposition. By the FA results of [\cite=MTVisual], that group must have a complete presentation diagram.

Suppose B is a group, and φ:A1  →  A2 is an isomorphism of subgroups of B. The group G with presentation [formula] is called an HNN extension with base group B, associated subgroups Ai and stable letter t. If A1 = B then the HNN extension is ascending and if additionally, A2 is a proper subgroup of B (i.e. A2  ≠  B), then the HNN extension is strictly ascending.

The bulk of this section is motivated by an example of Richard Thompson. Thompson's group F is finitely presented and is an ascending HNN extension of a group isomorphic to F. Hence F is not "hierarchical accessible" over such splittings (see question 1 below). If a group G splits as an ascending HNN extension, then (by definition) there is no splitting of the base group which is compatible with the first splitting, so standard accessibility is not an issue. The only question is that of minimality of such splittings.

Suppose A is a finitely generated group and φ:A  →  A is a monomorphism. Let [formula] be the resulting ascending HNN extension. Then:

1) If φ(A) has infinite index in A, this splitting of G is not minimal and there is no finitely generated subgroup B of G such that B is smaller than A, G splits as an ascending HNN extension over B and this splitting over B is minimal.

2) If φ(A) has finite index in A, then there is no finitely generated subgroup B of G such that B is smaller than A and G splits as an ascending HNN extension over B.

First note that G is also an ascending HNN extension over φ(A), (with presentation [formula]. Hence if φ(A) has infinite index in A, the splitting over A is not minimal. Part 5) of lemma [\ref=asc] implies the second assertion of part 1) of the theorem. Part 4) of lemma [\ref=asc] implies part 2) of the theorem.

Suppose φ:A  →  A and τ:B  →  B are monomorphisms of finitely generated subgroups of G, and the corresponding ascending HNN extensions are isomorphic to G.

[formula]

If [formula] has finite index in B (so B is potentially smaller than A). Then:

1) The normal closures N(A) and N(B) in G are equal.

2) If φ(A)  ≠  A then s = at for some a∈N(A)

3) If φ(A) = A, then τ(B) = B (so N(A) = A = B = N(B)) and s = at±  1 for some a∈A.

4) If φ(A) has finite index in A, then [formula] has finite index in A (so B is not smaller than A) and τ(B) has finite index in B.

5) If φ(A) has infinite index in A, then τ(B) has infinite index in B.

Let A0 = A and let Ai = tiA0t- ii. Then t- 1Ait = Ai - 1 < Ai. Note that [formula]. Let [formula] be the quotient map. Since [formula] has finite index in B, π(B) is finite (and hence trivial). This implies B < N(A). As B is finitely generated, B < Am for some m. This also implies that [formula] and so N(B) = N(A), completing 1).

Normal forms in ascending HNN extensions imply s = tpa1t- q for some p,q  ≥  0 and a1∈A. This implies |p - q| = 1. Hence s = at±  1 for a∈Ap.

Suppose s = at- 1. Let r be the maximum of m and p. Note that

[formula]

(since, t- 1Bt < t- 1Amt = Am - 1 < Ar and (as a∈Ar) aAra- 1 = Ar). But if φ(A)  ≠  A, [formula]. Instead, s = at, completing 2).

If φ(A) = A, then N(A) = A. As N(B) = A is finitely generated, [formula] for some n > 0. So N(B) = B completing 3).

If φ(A) has finite index in A then A has finite index in Ai for all i  ≥  0. Since N(A) = N(B), and A and B are finitely generated, there are positive integers p < p' and q < q' such that

[formula]

Hence B has finite index in sp' - pBs- (p' - p). This implies B has finite index in siBs- i for all i  ≥  0 and also τ(B) has finite index in B. Similarly, there are positive integers j and k such that

[formula]

Hence B and A (and so [formula]) have finite index in tkAt- k. This implies [formula] has finite index in A and 4) is complete.

Assume φ(A) has infinite index in A. As A and B are finitely generated subgroups of N(A) = N(B), there positive integers k and j such that

[formula]

The group B does not have finite index in tkAt- k since otherwise [formula] (and then A) would have finite index in tkAt- k. This implies B has infinite index in sjBs- j. This in turn implies B has infinite index in siBs- i for all i  ≥  0. This also implies τ(B) has infinite index in B.

In unpublished work, R. J. Thompson introduced a group, traditionally denoted F, in the context of finding infinite finitely presented simple groups. This group is now well studied in a variety of other contexts. The group F has presentation

[formula]

Well know facts about this group include: F is FP∞ ([\cite=BG]), in particular, F is finitely presented (with generators x1 and x2), the commutator subgroup of F is simple ([\cite=Br]), and F contains no free group of rank 2 ([\cite=BS]). Clearly, F is an ascending HNN extension of itself (with base group [formula] and stable letter x1 - called the "standard" splitting of F).

We are interested in understanding "minimal" splittings of F and more generally minimal splittings of finitely generated groups containing no non-abelian free group. We list some elementary facts.

Fact 1. If G contains no non-abelian free group and G splits as an amalgamated free product [formula] then C is of index 2 in both A and B and hence is normal in G. If G splits as an HNN-extension, then this splitting is ascending.

Fact 2. The group F does not split non-trivially as [formula]

Otherwise C is normal in F and F / C is isomorphic to [formula]. Since the commutator subgroup K of G is simple, [formula] is either trivial or K. The intersection is not K since F / C is not abelian. The intersection is non-trivial, since otherwise K would inject under the quotient map [formula].

By theorem [\ref=ind] and the previous facts we have:

Fact 3. The only non-trivial splittings of F are as ascending HNN extensions [formula]. For A finitely generated, this splitting is minimal iff the image of the monomorphism φ:A  →  A has finite index in A.

R. Bieri, W. D. Neumann and R. Strebel have shown that if G is a finitely presented group containing no free group of rank 2 and G maps onto [formula], then G contains a finitely generated normal subgroup H such that [formula] (see theorem D of [\cite=BNS] or theorem 18.3.8 of [\cite=Ge]). Hence, there is a short exact sequence [formula] with H finitely generated.

Fact 4. The ascending HNN extensions given by the short exact sequence [formula] (with H finitely generated) are minimal splittings.

Suppose G is a finitely generated group containing no non-abelian free subgroup. Suppose G can be written as an ascending HNN extension [formula] and as non-trivial amalgamated products [formula] and [formula] where all component groups are finitely generated, then:

1) [formula] does not have finite index in A or D (so neither A nor D is smaller than the other),

2) if [formula] has finite index in K then K = D (so neither D nor K is smaller than the other),

3) [formula] is a minimal splitting and [formula] is minimal iff φ(A) has finite index in A.

Let [formula] and [formula] be the quotient maps. If [formula] has finite index in D then q(D) is finite, so q(D) is trivial and D < N(A). But this implies there is a homomorphism from [formula] onto [formula], which is nonsense.

If [formula] has finite index in A, then p(A) is a finite subgroup of [formula]. Then p(A) is a subgroup of a conjugate of 〈x〉 or 〈y〉. Without loss, assume p(A) < 〈x〉. If p(A) = 1, then A < D and so N(A) < D. But this implies there is a homomorphism of [formula] onto [formula] which is nonsense. Hence p(A) = 〈x〉. But then p(t) commute with x. This is implies p(t) is trivial. This is impossible as p(t) and p(A) generate [formula]. Part 1) is finished.

Suppose [formula] has finite index in K. Then as above we can assume that p(K)  <  〈x〉. If p(K) = 1, then K < D. If additionally K  ≠  D then there is a homomorphism from [formula] onto [formula] with non-trivial kernel. This is impossible. Hence, either, K = D or p(K) = 〈x〉. We conclude that K = D since p(K) is normal in [formula], and 2) is finished.

Fact 1, and part 2) implies [formula] is a minimal splitting. Fact 1, theorem [\ref=ind] and part 1) imply [formula] is minimal iff φ(A) has finite index in A.

We conclude this paper with some questions of interest.

For an arbitrary finitely generated Coxeter group W, is there a sequence [formula] of graphs of groups such that Λ1 is a non-trivial decomposition of W with edge groups in M(W), and for i > 1, Λi is a non-trivial decomposition of a vertex group Vi of Λi - 1 with M(Vi)-edge groups (but Λi is not necessarily compatible with Λi - 1)? This sort of accessibility is called hierarchical accessibility in analogy with 3-manifold decompositions). If no such sequence exists, then does a last term of such a splitting sequence have no splittings of any sort (is it FA)? Would such a last term always be visual?

Is there a JSJ theorem for Coxeter groups over minimal splittings? In [\cite=MTJSJ], we produce a JSJ result for Coxeter groups over virtually abelian splitting subgroups that relies on splittings over minimal virtually abelian subgroups.

For the standard strictly ascending HNN splitting of Thompson's group F (given by [formula] - with base group [formula] and stable letter x1) there is no minimal splitting subgroup C of F with C smaller than B. Hence, for finitely presented groups, there is no analogue for proposition [\ref=L24N]. Still F, and in fact all finitely generated groups containing no non-abelian free group, are strongly accessible over finitely generated minimal splitting subgroups.

Are finitely presented groups (strongly) accessible over finitely generated minimal splittings?

Finitely generated groups are not accessible over finite splitting subgroups (see D2), and hence finitely generated groups are not accessible over minimal splittings.

Does Thompson's group split as a strict ascending HNN extension with finitely generated base A and monomorphism φ:A  →  A such that φ(A) has finite index in A?
