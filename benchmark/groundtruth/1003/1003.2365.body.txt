Introduction

Type Ia supernovae observational data suggest that the universe is dominated by two dark components: dark matter and dark energy [\cite=Riess]. Dark matter (DM), a matter without pressure, is mainly used to explain galactic curves and large-scale structure formation, while dark energy (DE), an exotic energy with negative pressure, is used to explain the present cosmic accelerating expansion. However, the nature of DE is still unknown, and people have proposed some candidates to describe it (for review see [\cite=Karami1] [\cite=Copeland] and references therein).

The holographic DE (HDE) is one of interesting DE candidates which was proposed based on the holographic principle [\cite=Horava]. According to the holographic principle, the number of degrees of freedom in a bounded system should be finite and has relations with the area of its boundary [\cite=Hooft]. By applying the holographic principle to cosmology, one can obtain the upper bound of the entropy contained in the Universe [\cite=Fischler]. Following this line, Li [\cite=Li] argued that for a system with size L and UV cut-off Λ without decaying into a black hole, it is required that the total energy in a region of size L should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size, thus L3ρΛ  ≤  LM2P, where ρΛ is the quantum zero-point energy density caused by UV cut-off Λ and MP is the reduced Planck mass M- 2P = 8πG. The largest L allowed is the one saturating this inequality, thus ρΛ = 3c2M2PL- 2, where c is a numerical constant. The HDE models have been studied widely in the literature [\cite=Enqvist] [\cite=Elizalde2] [\cite=Guberina1] [\cite=Guberina2]. Obviously, in the derivation of HDE, the black hole entropy SBH plays an important role. As is well known, usually, SBH  =  A / (4G), where A  ~  L2 is the area of horizon. However, in the literature, this entropy-area relation can be modified to [\cite=modak]

[formula]

where α̃ and [formula] are dimensionless constants of order unity. These corrections can appear in the black hole entropy in loop quantum gravity (LQG) [\cite=HW]. They can also be due to thermal equilibrium fluctuation, quantum fluctuation, or mass and charge fluctuations (for a good review see [\cite=HW] and references therein). Using the corrected entropy-area relation ([\ref=MEAR]), the energy density of the entropy-corrected HDE (ECHDE) can be obtained as [\cite=HW]

[formula]

where α and β are dimensionless constants of order unity.

Recently, the original agegraphic dark energy (OADE) and new agegraphic dark energy (NADE) models were proposed by Cai [\cite=Cai] and Wei & Cai [\cite=Wei1], respectively. These models are based on the uncertainty relation of quantum mechanics as well as the gravitational effect in general relativity. Following the line of quantum fluctuations of spacetime, Karolyhazy et al. [\cite=Kar1] argued that the distance t in Minkowski spacetime cannot be known to a better accuracy than δt  ~  t2 / 3Pt1 / 3 where tP is the reduced Planck time. Based on Karolyhazy relation, Maziashvili [\cite=Maz] discussed that the energy density of metric fluctuations of the Minkowski spacetime is given by

[formula]

Based on Karolyhazy relation [\cite=Kar1] and Maziashvili arguments [\cite=Maz], Cai proposed the OADE model to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe [\cite=Cai]. The ADE models assume that the observed DE comes from the spacetime and matter field fluctuations in the universe [\cite=Cai]. The OADE model had some difficulties. In particular, it cannot justify the matter-dominated era [\cite=Cai]. This motivated Wei and Cai [\cite=Wei1] to propose the NADE model, while the time scale is chosen to be the conformal time instead of the age of the universe. The evolution behavior of the NADE is very different from that of the OADE. Instead the evolution behavior of the NADE is similar to that of the HDE. But some essential differences exist between them. In particular, the NADE model is free of the drawback concerning causality problem which exists in the HDE model. The ADE models have arisen a lot of enthusiasm recently and have examined and studied in ample detail by [\cite=Wei2] [\cite=Kim] [\cite=Kim11] [\cite=Wei3] [\cite=Sheykhi].

Here our aim is to investigate the entropy-corrected version of the interacting NADE model in the non-flat universe. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a brief review on the NADE and the entropy-corrected NADE (ECNADE) models. In Section 3, we study the ECNADE in a FRW universe with spacial curvature and in the presence of interaction between DE and DM. In Section 4, we reconstruct the potential and the dynamics of the phantom scalar field according to the evolutionary behavior of the interacting ECNADE model. Section 5 is devoted to conclusions.

A brief review on the NADE and ECNADE models

From Eq. ([\ref=rhoMaz]), the energy density of the NADE is given by [\cite=Wei1]

[formula]

where the numerical factor 3n2 is introduced to parameterize some uncertainties, such as the species of quantum fields in the universe, the effect of curved spacetime (since the energy density is derived for Minkowski spacetime), and so on. It was found that the coincidence problem could be solved naturally in the NADE model provided that the single model parameter n is of order unity [\cite=Wei3]. Also η is conformal time of the FRW universe, and given by

[formula]

With the help of quantum corrections to the entropy-area relation ([\ref=MEAR]) in the setup of LQG, the energy density of the ECNADE is given by [\cite=HW]

[formula]

which closely mimics to that of ECHDE density ([\ref=ECHDE]) and L is replaced with the conformal time η. Here α and β are dimensionless constants of order unity. In the special case α  =  β = 0, the above equation yields the well-known NADE density ([\ref=NADE]).

Interacting ECNADE and DM in non-flat universe

We consider the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric for the non-flat universe as

[formula]

where k = 0,1, - 1 represent a flat, closed and open FRW universe, respectively. Observational evidences support the existence of a closed universe with a small positive curvature (Ωk  ~  0.02) [\cite=Bennett]. Besides, as usually believed, an early inflation era leads to a flat universe. This is not a necessary consequence if the number of e-foldings is not very large [\cite=Huang]. It is still possible that there is a contribution to the Friedmann equation from the spatial curvature when studying the late universe, though much smaller than other energy components according to observations.

For the non-flat FRW universe containing the DE and DM, the first Friedmann equation has the following form

[formula]

where ρΛ and ρm are the energy density of DE and DM, respectively. Let us define the dimensionless energy densities as

[formula]

then, the first Friedmann equation yields

[formula]

We consider a universe containing an interacting ECNADE density ρΛ and the cold dark matter (CDM), with ωm = 0. The energy equations for ECNADE and CDM are

[formula]

[formula]

where following [\cite=Kim06], we choose Q = ΓρΛ as an interaction term and [formula] is the decay rate of the ECNADE component into CDM with a coupling constant b2. This expression for the interaction term Q was first introduced in the study of the suitable coupling between a quintessence scalar field and a pressureless CDM field [\cite=Amendola1]. Although at this point the interaction may look purely phenomenological but different Lagrangians have been proposed in support of it [\cite=Tsujikawa]. Tsujikawa and Sami [\cite=Tsujikawa] investigated the cosmological scaling solutions in a general cosmological background [formula] including general relativity (GR), Randall-Sundrum (RS) braneworld and Gauss-Bonnet (GB) braneworld. The GR, RS and GB cases correspond to ε  =  1, ε  =  2 and ε  =  2 / 3, respectively. The condition for the existence of scaling solutions restricts the form of the scalar field Lagrangian (or the pressure density) to be p = X1 / εg(Xeελφ), where φ is a scalar field with X defined as X =  - gμν∂μφ∂νφ / 2 and g is an arbitrary function. Also [formula], where Q is the coupling term due to the interaction between the scalar filed and the matter. Tsujikawa and Sami [\cite=Tsujikawa] showed that in the absence of the coupling Q between a scalar field and a perfect barotropic fluid, it is not possible to get an acceleration of the universe since the energy density of the field φ decreases in proportional to that of the background fluid for scaling solutions. However the presence of the coupling Q allows to have an accelerated expansion. It should be emphasized that this phenomenological description has proven viable when contrasted with observations, i.e., SNIa, CMB, large scale structure, H(z), and age constraints [\cite=Wang8], and recently in galaxy clusters [\cite=Bertolami8]. The choice of the interaction between both components was to get a scaling solution to the coincidence problem such that the universe approaches a stationary stage in which the ratio of DE and DM becomes a constant [\cite=Hu]. The dynamics of interacting DE models with different Q-classes have been studied in ample detail by [\cite=Amendola].

From definition ρΛ = 3M2PH2ΩΛ, we get

[formula]

where

[formula]

Taking derivative of Eq. ([\ref=density-nade-omega]) with respect to x =  ln a, using [formula] and [formula] where prime denotes the derivative with respect to x, one can obtain the equation of motion for ΩΛ as

[formula]

Taking time derivative of the first Friedmann equation ([\ref=eqfr]) and using Eqs. ([\ref=density-nade]), ([\ref=eqomega]), ([\ref=eq10]), ([\ref=eqCDM]), ([\ref=density-nade-omega]), ([\ref=gamma-parameter1]) one can get

[formula]

Substituting this into Eq. ([\ref=omegaD-eq-motion1]), one obtains

[formula]

Taking time derivative of Eq. ([\ref=density-nade]), using [formula] and substituting the result in Eq. ([\ref=eqpol]) yields the equation of state (EoS) parameter of the interacting ECNADE as

[formula]

which shows that the interacting ECNADE can cross the phantom divide, i.e. ωΛ <  - 1, when

[formula]

During the inflation era where H =  constant, we have a = eHt and from Eq. ([\ref=eta]) we get η =  - 1 / Ha. Since the last two terms in Eq. ([\ref=density-nade]) can be comparable to the first term only when η is very small, the corrections make sense only at the late stage of the inflationary expansion of the universe. During the cosmological inflation in the early universe, ECNADE reduces to the NADE model. The EoS parameter of the interacting ECNADE during the inflation era will be

[formula]

with

[formula]

The deceleration parameter is given by

[formula]

Putting Eq. ([\ref=H-dot-to-H2]) in the above relation reduces to

[formula]

Note that if we set α  =  β = 0 then from Eq. ([\ref=gamma-parameter1]) γn = 1. Therefore Eqs. ([\ref=state-parameter]) and ([\ref=deceleration]) reduce to

[formula]

[formula]

which are the EoS and deceleration parameters of the interacting NADE with CDM in the non-flat universe [\cite=Sheykhi] [\cite=Karami5].

Following [\cite=Cai], the OADE density is given by

[formula]

where T is the age of the universe and given by

[formula]

Note that appearing the age of the universe T in the energy density of the OADE model causes some difficulties. In particular it fails to describe the matter-dominated epoch properly [\cite=Cai]. Similar to the density of ECNADE ([\ref=density-nade]), the density of entropy-corrected OADE (ECOADE) can be written as

[formula]

To obtain the evolution of the density parameter, the EoS and deceleration parameters of the interacting ECOADE in a non-flat FRW universe, one doesn't need to repeat the calculations. The only necessary changes are that one must replace η with T in Eq. ([\ref=gamma-parameter1]) and put a = 1 in Eqs. ([\ref=omegaD-eq-motion2]), ([\ref=state-parameter]) and ([\ref=deceleration]).

Entropy-corrected new agegraphic phantom model

Here we suggest a correspondence between the interacting ECNADE model with the phantom scalar field model. The phantom scalar field model is often regarded as an effective description of an underlying theory of DE [\cite=Wu]. Recent observational data indicates that the EoS parameter ωΛ lies in a narrow strip around ωΛ  =   - 1 and is quite consistent with being below this value. The region where the EoS is less than - 1 is typically referred to as a being due to some form of phantom (ghost) DE [\cite=Copeland]. However, although fundamental theories such as string/M theory do provide this scalar field, they do not uniquely predict its potential V(φ) [\cite=Wu] [\cite=Ali]. Therefore it becomes meaningful to reconstruct V(φ) from some DE models possessing some significant features of the LQG theory, such as ECHDE and ECNADE models.

The energy density and pressure of the phantom scalar field φ are as follows [\cite=Copeland]

[formula]

[formula]

The EoS parameter for the phantom scalar field is given by

[formula]

Here like [\cite=Karami2], we establish the correspondence between the interacting ECNADE scenario and the phantom DE model, then equating Eq. ([\ref=wq]) with the EoS parameter of interacting ECNADE ([\ref=state-parameter]), ωph  =  ωΛ, and also equating Eq. ([\ref=rhoq]) with ([\ref=density-nade]), ρph  =  ρΛ, we have

[formula]

[formula]

Substituting Eqs. ([\ref=density-nade]) and ([\ref=state-parameter]) into Eqs. ([\ref=phidot2-2]) and ([\ref=Vphi-2]), one can obtain the kinetic energy term and the phantom potential energy as follows

[formula]

[formula]

From Eq. ([\ref=phi2q]) and using [formula], one can obtain the evolutionary form of the phantom scalar field as

[formula]

where a0 is the scale factor at the present time.

Conclusions

Here we considered the entropy-corrected version of the NADE model which is in interaction with CDM in the non-flat FRW universe. However, some experimental data have implied that our universe is not a perfectly flat universe and that it possesses a small positive curvature ([formula]) [\cite=Bennett]. Although it is believed that our universe is flat, a contribution to the Friedmann equation from spatial curvature is still possible if the number of e-foldings is not very large [\cite=Huang]. The ADE models proposed to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe, based on the uncertainty relation of quantum mechanics as well as the gravitational effect in general relativity [\cite=Cai] [\cite=Wei1]. We considered the logarithmic correction term to the energy density of NADE model. The addition of correction terms to the energy density of NADE is motivated from the LQG which is one of the promising theories of quantum gravity. Using this modified energy density, we derived the exact differential equation that determines the evolution of the ECNADE density parameter. We also obtained the EoS and deceleration parameters for the interacting ECNADE and present a necessary condition for the present model to cross the phantom divide. Moreover, we established a correspondence between the interacting ECNADE density and the phantom scalar field model of DE. We adopted the viewpoint that the scalar field models of DE are effective theories of an underlying theory of DE. Thus, we should be capable of using the scalar field model to mimic the evolving behavior of the interacting ECNADE and reconstructing this scalar field model. We reconstructed the potential and the dynamics of the phantom scalar field, which describe accelerated expansion of the universe, according to the evolutionary behavior of the interacting ECNADE model.
