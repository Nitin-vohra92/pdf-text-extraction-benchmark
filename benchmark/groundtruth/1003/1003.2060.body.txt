Statement and proof of the results

The Hurwitz zeta function is classically defined for [formula] as

[formula]

with w being a positive real number, and it can be continued analytically to the whole s-plane, except for a pole in 1 (see e.g. [\cite=co07]). Sometimes the definition is extended by letting w be a complex number, while in other situations w is only restricted to be a real number in (0,1]. Notice in fact the following relation:

[formula]

which follows by considering a summation over the terms (n + 1 + w).

The following theorem is meant to add a new result to what is already known about its zeros (see e.g. [\cite=sp76]). As usual in the literature, σ will denote the real part of s.

Suppose that σ > 0 and σ  ≠  1. Then [formula].

To make it clear how the steps in the proof drive towards the thesis and where they leave space for possible improvements, we use here the following approach: we start considering s a generic complex number and only later we will add conditions on the parameters.

As a first step we derive a representation for the Hurwitz zeta function through the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula, in analogy with the one derived for the classical Riemann zeta function (see e.g [\cite=ed01]). Namely, the following Euler-Maclaurin summation formula

[formula]

where [formula] are Bernoulli numbers, is applied to f(n) = (n + w)- s letting M tend to ∞  , to obtain, for [formula],

[formula]

This formula is in fact true for all [formula], as explained for the analogous case of the Riemann zeta function ([\cite=ed01]) by considering an expression for the remainder in integral form and its correspondent halfplane of convergence (see also [\cite=co07]).

The formula above implies that, if we restrict to [formula], s  ≠  1,

[formula]

We notice that

[formula]

where

[formula]

is such that 0 > λ1  >  λN  >  λN + 1.

After computing [formula], we get

[formula]

so that

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

ζ(σ,w) is negative and in particular nonzero when σ∈(0,1) and 1 - σ  ≤  w.

A particular case is the following well known result (see e.g. [\cite=ap76]):

The Riemann zeta function ζ(s) has no zeros in (0,1).

In fact ζ(s) = ζ(s,1).

In order to prove the above statement we use Voronin's universality theorem.

We remark (see [\cite=st07]) that, if Voronin's theorem were true even if g(s) is allowed to vanish, then the Riemann Hypothesis would be false. Though, as shown in the reference cited, this cannot happen, i.e a function having zeros cannot be approximated uniformly by ζ, which in fact hints at the relation between universality and distribution of zeros. In this regard we notice that with another notion of universality, slightly different from that expressed by Voronin's theorem, it would be possible to find functions which satisfy the main properties of ζ, namely the functional equation in (2), the property of being analytic except for a pole in 1 and that of being real on the real axis, but do not satisfy the Riemann Hypothesis (see [\cite=ni09]).

We are going then to proceed by contradiction, assuming that the Riemann Hypothesis is false: suppose that s0 is a zero in the strip [formula] and let K be any compact in this strip containing s0. Let s1 = 1 / 2 + it1 be a fixed root of ζ on the critical line. For any given ε > 0, by continuity, there exists η > 0 such that [formula] implies |ζ(s)| < ε / 4.

Since the derivative of ζ is strongly (i.e: the function to be approximated need not be non-vanishing) universal in Voronin's sense (see [\cite=st07]), for any δ > 0

[formula]

for any compact K2 in the right open half of the strip.

Now, we know from our hypothesis that there exists a λ (which we can take less than η) such that the condition is fulfilled for the pair ε / 4,η. We will take K2 as a compact containing all lines from K to the segment

[formula]

|ζ(s+iτ)-ζ(s)|≤|(ζ'(s+iτ)-ζ'(s))ds|+|ζ(s+λ+iαη+iτ)|+|ζ(s+λ+iαη)|

[formula]

lim inf μ{τ∈ : max |ζ(s+iτ)-ζ(s)|≤ ε }>0.

[formula]

We can also modify our requirement in the following way:

Suppose that ζ' is strongly universal for any compact in [formula], where s* is a zero on the critical line and η is a positive real number. Then the Riemann Hypothesis is true.

We see, from the proof given above, that, if ζ' were strongly universal in [formula], this would allow us to take K2 as a compact including part of the critical line (and so forget about λ) and the proof would follow more easily applying directly Selberg's theorem without our additional condition.

Suppose that ζ' is strongly universal in [formula]. Then the Riemann Hypothesis is true.

We will find now another sufficient condition, by a completely different approach.

We first define:

[formula]

Notice that F(s) can be analytically continued in the zeros of ζ, by defining it there to be [formula] from (2).

This actually not only shows that zeros of the denominator are just removable singularities, but also that, if s is a zero, then s and 1 - s have the same multiplicity.

Consider now [formula], which can also be seen as a truncated sum: if we define (as in [\cite=pu08]):

[formula]

then HN(s) is just [formula], the N-th partial sum of the series [formula], which is equal to ζ(s) because of the summation formula in (8)):

[formula]

so that

[formula]

and, if ζ(s) = 0,

[formula]

Suppose now s*  =  σ* + it* is in the critical strip.

Whenever ζ(s*)  ≠  0 (and so ζ(1 - s*)  ≠  0), then

[formula]

Since lim N  →    ∞HN(1 - s*) = ζ(1 - s*)  ≠  0, we have:

[formula]

Now, for a(s),b(s) functions with real positive values, let [formula] (resp. with b), with, as usual, s = σ + it, and let [formula].

Notice that in proving the previous proposition we didn't use the fact that we had N-th partial sums in both the numerator and the denominator. Then along the same lines we can also prove:

If ζ(s*)  ≠  0, then

[formula]

Let's consider now Ha,b(s*) when s* is zero of ζ: we claim that

For any zero s* of ζ, if a(s),b(s) are constants, A and B, we have [formula].

Write ⌈A- 1 / 2σN1 - σ⌉ first as A- 1 / 2σN1 - σ  +  ε with 0  ≤  ε < 1, and then as [formula]. After a similar decomposition has been done for fB(N,1 - s), since we're supposing that ζ(s*) = 0 (so that [formula] as shown above using the summation formula), we can write

[formula]

By the binomial expansion of (1 + x)z,

[formula]

and

[formula]

so that we finally get

[formula]

[formula]

Consider now the case a(s) = b(s) = |F(s)|. Using the fact that |F(s)| = 1 / |F(1 - s)|, one sees in a similar manner that

[formula]

if s is a zero. If it is not a zero, then the statement is of course true, so that we have built a continuous function.

We look at this point at the functions which are the argument of lim  in the definition of H|F(s)|,|F(s)|(s), and call them |F(s)|N. We first notice that for σ = 1 / 2, they are always equal to 1 and equal to the limit |F(s)| = 1. In the right open half instead we have |F(s)| < 1 as soon as t is large enough (see Theorem 3.7 in the next section; and [formula] is actually monotonically decreasing in σ for fixed t > 2π + 1, as proven in [\cite=sa03]). Moreover it is not hard to see that, for each s in this region, the sequence {|F(s)|N}N admits a strictly monotone subsequence: for that it suffices to check that {|F(s)|N}N does not get constant from some point, which can be seen for example by the fact that, for any two constants k1 and k2, ⌈k1N1 - σ⌉ and ⌈k2Nσ⌉ are increasing by different rates for N large enough. Now, if for an s in the half strip |F(s)|N < |F(s)|M for some N,M, by continuity this holds true also in a neighboorhood. In the theorem below we will essentially assume that the intersection of all this kind of neighboorhoods relative to some subsequence does not reduce to a point.

Before stating the theorem, we notice that we can also consider slightly different functions converging to |F(s)|: for example in the numerator of |F(s)|N, we could take [formula] instead of f|F(s)|(N,s) and call the new approximants as |Fm(s)|N.

Suppose that for each s in the right (or left) open half strip we can find a neighboorhood Is and a subsequence Nk(s) such that {|F(s)|Nk}Nk and {|Fm(s)|Nk}Nk converge monotonically (either increasing or decreasing for the whole Is). Then the Riemann Hypothesis is true.

Thanks to the hypothesis of monotonicity, and since the approximants converge by construction to a continuous function, by Dini's theorem, the convergence in a compact set D inside Is would be uniform. This implies that, for N bigger than some N1, |F(s)|N is uniformly bounded in D: then, for those N, possible zeros of the denominator Hf|F(1 - s)|(N,1 - s)(1 - s) would have to be zeros of the numerator Hf|F(s)|(N,s)(s) too. And for N bigger than some N2 zeros of Hf|F(1 - s)|(N,1 - s)(1 - s) would also be zeros of Hm|F(s)|(N,s)(s). But HN and HN + 1 cannot both be zero, at least for N large, which is what interests us now: the difference between the two is hN(s), which is 0 exactly when [formula]; though [formula] which is only an approximation of the binomial expansion of [formula]. (In fact in the critical strip this is also true for small values, as stated in [\cite=pu04].)

In conclusion, for all N big enough, HN would have to be nonzero throughout D, which, by Hurwitz's theorem, is sufficient to prove that ζ has no zeros in D.

Equivalent criteria for the Riemann Hypothesis

In the first part of this section we concentrate on results that involve zeros of partial sums. One of the most famous theorems in this regard is a classical by Turán, who proved the following (see e.g. [\cite=ap90] or [\cite=bo08]):

Let [formula]. If there exists an N0 such that ζN(s)  ≠  0 for all N  ≥  N0 and all σ > 1, then the Riemann Hypothesis is true.

We remark that this is only a one-side implication, which has also proved to be unuseful for a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis, since Montgomery proved the existence of roots of these partial sums in certain half planes to the right of the critical strip, as cited in the references above.

In this regard and in general about zeros of partial sums it's recommended to have a look at [\cite=bo07], [\cite=go07b], [\cite=go08a] too.

Our first result in this direction is the following:

The Riemann Hypothesis is true if and only if for any compact disc K in the right open half of the critical strip there exists an N0 such that, for infinitely many N > N0, HN(s) is non-vanishing for all s in K.

If the Riemann Hypothesis is true, then there are no zeros in the right open half. In any compact K then |ζ| has a minimum m > 0. Now, by (8), we know that

[formula]

(keeping in mind the usual remark about the O notation). By taking N big enough, this can be made smaller than m / 2 for all s in K, so that, by the triangular inequality, |HN(s)| = |HN(s) - ζ(s) + ζ(s)|  ≥  |ζ(s)| - |HN(s) - ζ(s)|  ≥  m / 2 > 0.

In the other direction, to prove that the Riemann Hypothesis is true, we can use Hurwitz's theorem (see footnote in the previous section). Since our hypothesis implies that for any compact disc K there cannot exist a sequence sN in K which is a zero for HN for all sufficiently large N, Hurwitz's theorem tells us that there is no zero of ζ in K. But any s in the right open half is center of a compact disc in the interior of this strip.

We can derive a similar statement using the approximants [formula]. We have

The Riemann Hypothesis is true if and only if for any compact disc K in the right open half of the critical strip there exists an N0 such that, for infinitely many N > N0, φN(s) is non-vanishing for all s in K.

We can follow the same argument as above, provided that we consider (1 - 21 - s)- 1  ·  φN(s). Notice that in this case we know that φN(s) is converging uniformly in any compact of the strip, since any Dirichlet series converges uniformly on every compact subset interior to its half-plane of convergence (see e.g. [\cite=ap76]).

Generalizing a bit these results, for example for the case of HN(s):

The Riemann Hypothesis is true if and only if for any compact disc K in the right open half of the critical strip there exists an analytic function f(N,s) which tends to zero in K as N  →    ∞  , [formula], [formula] such that, for infinitely many N > N0, [formula] is non-vanishing for all s in K.

If the Riemann Hypothesis is true, then for any K, as we saw in the previous equivalence, there exists an N0 such that, for infinitely many N > N0, HN(s) is non-vanishing for all s in K. This corresponds to taking, f(N,s) = 0 for all s in K, α1 = 1 and all other α equal to 0. In the other direction, the proof follows the one given above for the less general case, since [formula] is also converging to ζ(s) uniformly on K.

For example it would be sufficient to prove that the arithmetic mean of HN and HN - 1 is always nonzero for infinitely many N > N0 and for all s in any given K. This might be easier, though being essentially equivalent; we already remarked that if one of the two is zero, the other is not, which might be useful.

In the sequel other equivalent reformulations, though of a different nature, are to be found.

Let s0  =  σ0 + it0 be a zero of ζ in the critical strip. F(s0), where F is defined as in the previous section, is then the nonzero value [formula].

|F(s0)| = 1 if and only if the Riemann Hypothesis is true.

In fact |F(s0)| = 1 happens when [formula].

When σ = 1 / 2, the right member is equal to 1 by (11) so for any t the two members are equal. Otherwise from (12) we get that, for σ < 1 / 2, [formula]. This means that, for σ < 1 / 2 and [formula], [formula], so that the right and left member will never be equal in this case.

For σ > 1 / 2, let z = 1 - s so that [formula]: then [formula]. And this means that, for σ > 1 / 2 and [formula], we have that [formula], and again the right and left member will never be equal in this case either. But notice that the region [formula] is the symmetric, about the critical line, of the region [formula]. And, because of (3), if in a region there are no zeros, there are no zeros in the symmetric region either. It follows that there are no zeros in {0 < σ < 1 / 2}, a part possibly on the line [formula], which we can though exclude since we know that the first zero in the upper half-plane has imaginary part larger than 14. This implies, by (3), that there are no zeros in the whole critical strip except the critical line.

In fact if we consider a generic s instead of a zero in the theorem above, we can prove the following:

|F(s)| = 1 in the critical strip if and only if s satisfies the following: σ = 1 / 2 or [formula] or [formula].

The only difference with the proof above is that, thanks to (6) and the fact that F(s) = 1 / F(1 - s), if |F(s)|  ≠  1 in a region as before, neither it will be in the symmetric one. That it is in fact 1 on the curve lines follows by continuity, since one can easily compute that, in [formula], |F(s)| > 1 while it is smaller than 1 below the line (take for example the part of real axis inside the strip, where ζ is negative and decreasing: see [\cite=iv03]).

Notice that this result improves the known asympotic estimates or almost equivalences (see for example [\cite=go07b], [\cite=sa03] and [\cite=br04] in addition to the known asymptotic estimate by Stirling's approximation), which on the other hand would have been sufficient to prove Theorem 3.5.

We remark that theorems 3.5 and 3.7 are not specific of ζ per se: it's not hard for example to build from ζ other analytic functions which safisfy the functional equation and the property of being real on the real axis (and which might also have zeros not on the critical line), by multiplying it with an expression of the type [formula]. As [\cite=sa03] and [\cite=sa04] say, the Riemann Hypothesis would follow if we could improve these results and obtain a strict inequality (|ζ(σ + it)| > |ζ(1 - σ + it)| for 0 < σ < 1 / 2 and t > 2π + 1), since roots have to be symmetric with respect to the critical line.

Let us see now how theorem 3.5 can bring to other formulations of the Riemann Hypothesis. Let's suppose that the multiplicity of s0 is m (as well as that of 1 - s0, as we already remarked in the previous section). Since ζ(s) and ζ(1 - s) are analytic at s0, the following power series expansions hold for s in a neighboorhood of s0:

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

By (6), [formula] for any s, so that |ζ(m)(s)| = |ζ(m)(s̄)|.

We then also have

[formula]

Thus we can write the following propositions:

The Riemann Hypothesis is true if and only if [formula]

and

The Riemann Hypothesis is true if and only if [formula]

We can write explicit expansions for these derivatives. For example we can look at F(s) with the representation of ζ as in (5). Then [formula], where F(s0), as above, is clearly meant to be its analytic continuation in s0. Since there's only one possible analytic continuation and since the second fraction is a nonzero constant at s0, then [formula] should also be some nonzero constant.

And, similarly as above,

[formula]

By the analytic properties of Dirichlet series (see [\cite=ap76]), we can write (differentiating term by term) for [formula]:

[formula]

So we would like to evaluate:

[formula]

(limit of the denominator is nonzero, so that we can put the limit before the fraction).

We can then rephrase the previous proposition in the following way:

Suppose that

[formula]

with s0 a zero of order m. Then this implies

[formula]

if and only if the Riemann Hypothesis is true.

Clearly a similar argument would hold if we consider 1 -  instead.

On the other hand it would be sufficient, to prove the Riemann Hypothesis, to show that |F(s0)| or

[formula]

is going to be 0 or ∞   (thus not a nonzero constant) if s0 is not on the critical line.

To investigate whether |F(s0)| is equal to 1, we can consider also the function we built in the previous section through the approximants HN.

For example showing that H|F(s0)|,|F(1 - s0)|(s), which is continuous in s0, is also continuous at least in 1 - s0, would prove that |F(s0)| = 1, since we would have |F(1 - s0)| = |F(s0)|, because of continuity and lemma 2.12, but on the other hand |F(s0)| = 1 / |F(1 - s0)|.

Or showing that there exists a constant k such that H|F(s)|,|F(s)|(s) = Hk,k(s) for all s in the strip would also imply |F(s0)| = 1. (Clearly this holds locally for a neighboorhood: being s in a sufficiently small neighboorhood of s* ensures us that, if s* is a zero, then by (4), ζ(s) will not be zero, and, if s* is not a zero, then by continuity ζ(s) will not be zero either. So we are in the same situation as in the previous propositions 2.10 and 2.11, where what essentially counts is that the H-subscript N or f(N,s) tends to infinity with N.)

In other words in this case Theorem 3.5 can be reformulated as

The Riemann Hypothesis is true if and only if H1,1(s) is continuous throughout the strip.

Notice that we can also state the following, which though is essentially weaker, as the continuity in this case appears to be much less at hand.

The Riemann Hypothesis is true if and only if [formula] is continuous.

If the Riemann Hypothesis is true, then there are only zeros on the critical line, where [formula] since, for each N, HN(s) is the conjugate of HN(s̄) and so it has the same modulus. On the other side, we show that, if the Riemann Hypothesis were not true, then the limit would not be continuous. This is because in a zero out of the critical line, if we compute similarly as done in lemma 2.12, the limit would now be 0 or ∞  , while we know that F(s) is always nonzero.
