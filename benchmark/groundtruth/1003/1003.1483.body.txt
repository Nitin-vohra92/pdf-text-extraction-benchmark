Introduction

Let f:X  →  Y be a smooth projective morphism between smooth projective varieties defined over [formula]. The following theorem is one of the main results of this paper.

If X is a weak Fano manifold, that is, - KX is nef and big, then so is Y.

Although we could not find Theorem [\ref=thm1] in the literature, it seems to be known to some experts. Here, we claim the originality of our proof. Our proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1] is Hodge theoretic. We do not need mod p reduction arguments. More precisely, we obtain Theorem [\ref=thm1] as an application of Kawamata's positivity theorem (cf. [\cite=kawamata]). By the same method, we can recover the well-known result on Fano manifolds.

If X is a Fano manifold, that is, - KX is ample, then so is Y.

Our proof of Theorem [\ref=thm2] is completely different from the original one by Kollár, Miyaoka, and Mori in [\cite=kmm]. It is the first proof which does not use mod p reduction arguments. We raise a conjecture on the semi-ampleness of anti-canonical divisors.

If - KX is semi-ample, then so is - KY.

We reduce Conjecture [\ref=conj1] to another conjecture on canonical bundle formulas and give affirmative answers to Conjecture [\ref=conj1] in some special cases (cf. Remark [\ref=011] and Theorem [\ref=torsion]). In this paper, we obtain the following theorem, which is a key result for the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1] and Theorem [\ref=thm2].

If - KX is semi-ample, then - KY is nef.

We note that the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm3] is also an application of Kawamata's positivity theorem. We note that it is the first time that Theorem [\ref=thm3] is proved without mod p reduction arguments. The reader will recognize that Kawamata's positivity theorem is very powerful. We can find related topics in [\cite=zhang] and [\cite=debarre]. Note that both of them depend on mod p reduction arguments.

We summarize the contents of this paper. Section [\ref=sec2] is a preliminary section. We recall Kawamata's positivity theorem (cf. Theorem [\ref=ka-th]) here. In Section [\ref=sec3], we treat log Fano varieties with only kawamata log terminal singularities. The result obtained in this section will be used in Section [\ref=sec4]. In Section [\ref=sec4], we prove Theorem [\ref=thm1], Theorem [\ref=thm2], and some related theorems. In Section [\ref=sec5], we give some comments and questions on related topics. In the final section: Section [\ref=sec-app], which is an appendix, we give a mod p reduction approach to Theorem [\ref=thm1].

This paper is an expanded version of the second author's note [\cite=gongyo]. It is also the part II of the first author's paper [\cite=fujinoa].

We will work over [formula], the complex number field, from Section [\ref=sec2] to Section [\ref=sec4].

Preliminaries

We will make use of the standard notation as in the book [\cite=km].

For a [formula]-divisor [formula] on a normal variety X such that Dj is a prime divisor for every j and Di  ≠  Dj for i  ≠  j, we define

[formula]

We denote the of D by [formula]. Furthermore, let f:X  →  Y be a surjective morphism of varieties. We define

[formula]

Let X be a normal variety and Δ an effective [formula]-divisor on X such that KX  +  Δ is [formula]-Cartier. Let φ:Y  →  X be a projective resolution such that the union of the exceptional locus of φ and the strict transform of Δ has a simple normal crossing support on Y. We put

[formula]

where Ei is a prime divisor for every i and Ei  ≠  Ej for i  ≠  j. The pair (X,Δ) is called (, for short) (resp.  (, for short)) pair if ai >  - 1 (resp. ai  ≥   - 1) for every i.

Let f:X  →  Y be a smooth surjective morphism between smooth varieties with connected fibers and [formula] a reduced divisor on X such that Dh = D, where Di is a prime divisor for every i. We say that D is if D satisfies the condition that for each closed point x∈X, there exits an analytic open neighborhood U and [formula] inducing a regular system of parameter on f- 1f(x) at x, where k =  dim f- 1f(x), such that [formula] for some l with 0  ≤  l  ≤  k.

Let us recall Kawamata's positivity theorem in [\cite=kawamata]. It is the main ingredient of this paper.

Let f:X  →  Y be a surjective morphism of smooth projective varieties with connected fibers. Let [formula] and [formula] be simple normal crossing divisors on X and Y, respectively, such that f- 1(Q)  ⊆  P and f is smooth over [formula]. Let [formula] be a [formula]-divisor dj's may be negative or zero, which satisfies the following conditions

[formula] is relatively normal crossing over [formula] and [formula],

dj < 1 unless [formula],

[formula], where η is the generic point of Y, and

[formula] for some [formula]-divisor L on Y.

Let

[formula]

Then M is nef. We sometimes call M resp. Δ0 the resp. .

In Theorem [\ref=ka-th], we note that δl can be characterized as follows. If we put

[formula]

then δl = 1 - cl.

We give a remark on the Stein factorization. We will use Lemma [\ref=04] in Section [\ref=sec4]. See also Remark [\ref=rem-stein] below.

Let f:X  →  Y be a smooth projective morphism between smooth varieties. Let

[formula]

be the Stein factorization. Then g:Z  →  Y is étale. Therefore, h:X  →  Z is a smooth projective morphism between smooth varieties with connected fibers.

By assumption, Rif*OX is locally free and

[formula]

for every i and any y∈Y. By definition, [formula]. Since g*OZ≃f*OX is locally free, g is flat. By construction,

[formula]

consists of n copies of [formula] for any y∈Y, where n is the rank of f*OX. Therefore, g is unramified. This implies that g is étale. Thus, Z is a smooth variety and h:X  →  Z is a smooth morphism with connected fibers.

Log Fano varieties

The proof of the following theorem is essentially the same as [\cite=fujinoa]. We will use similar arguments in Section [\ref=sec4].

Let f:X  →  Y be a proper surjective morphism between normal projective varieties with connected fibers. Let Δ be an effective [formula]-divisor on X such that (X,Δ) is klt. Assume that - (KX  +  Δ  +  εf*H) is semi-ample, where ε is a positive rational number and H is an ample Cartier divisor on Y. Then we can find an effective [formula]-divisor ΔY on Y such that (Y,ΔY) is klt and - (KY  +  ΔY) is ample. In particular, if KY is [formula]-Cartier, then - KY is big.

By replacing H with mH and ε with [formula] for some sufficiently large positive integer m, we can assume that H is very ample and ε < 1. By replacing H with a general member of |H|, we can further assume that (X,Δ  +  εf*H) is klt. Let A be a general member of a free linear system | - m(KX  +  Δ  +  εf*H)| such that [formula] is klt and

[formula]

We put [formula]. Then we consider the following commutative diagram:

[formula]

where

X' and Y' are smooth projective varieties,

ν and μ are projective birational morphisms,

we put L =  - KY' and define a [formula]-divisor D on X' as follows:

[formula]

and

there are simple normal crossing divisors P on X' and Q on Y' which satisfy the conditions (1) of Theorem [\ref=ka-th] and there exists a set of sufficiently small non-negative rational numbers {sl} such that [formula] is ample.

We see that f':X'  →  Y', D, and L satisfy the conditions (1), (2), and (4) in Theorem [\ref=ka-th]. Now we check the condition (3) in Theorem [\ref=ka-th]. We put [formula].

[formula]

Since (X,Γ) is klt, we see that [formula] is effective and ν-exceptional. Thus it holds that [formula]. Since f*OX  =  OY, we have [formula].

By Claim [\ref=clA], we see that f':X'  →  Y' and D satisfy the condition (3) in Theorem [\ref=ka-th] since μ is birational. If we take [formula]-divisors Δ0 and M on Y' as in Theorem [\ref=ka-th], then

[formula]

and M is nef. We have the following claim about Δ0.

Δ+0  ≥  εμ*H.

Since H is general, h*H is reduced. We set [formula]. Note that the coefficient of Pkj in D is ε for every j by the generality of H and A. By the definition of kj, it holds that

[formula]

Thus we have Δ+0  ≥  εμ*H.

We decompose ε  =  ε' + ε'' such that ε' and ε'' are positive rational numbers. Since M is nef, [formula] is ample. Hence, there exists an effective [formula]-divisor B such that [formula], [formula] is klt, and [formula] is simple normal crossing. If ε' is a sufficiently small positive rational number, then we see that

[formula]

We set

[formula]

It holds that

[formula]

By the following claim, μ*Ω' is effective.

μ*Δ-0 = 0.

Let [formula], where δlk < 0. If there exists k and j such that [formula], it holds that - dj + 1  ≤  wlkj since wlkj is an integer. Then we obtain δlk  ≥  0. Thus, it holds that [formula] for all k and j. Therefore we have [formula]. Since OY' = f'*OX', we see that [formula]. By Claim [\ref=clA], μ*Qlk = 0. We finish the proof of Claim [\ref=clB].

We put Ω  =  μ*Ω'. Then we see that Ω is effective by Claim [\ref=clB],

[formula]

Thus (Y,ΔY) is klt and [formula] is ample if we put ΔY  =  Ω  -  ε''H  ≥  0. We finish the proof of Theorem [\ref=06].

Let (X,B) be a projective klt pair. Then - (KX + B) is semi-ample if and only if - (KX + B) is nef and abundant by [\cite=fujino-ka].

The following corollary is obvious by Theorem [\ref=06].

Let f:X  →  Y be a proper surjective morphism between normal projective varieties with connected fibers. Let Δ be an effective [formula]-divisor on X such that (X,Δ) is klt and - (KX  +  Δ) is ample. Then there is an effective [formula]-divisor ΔY on Y such that (Y,ΔY) is klt and - (KY  +  ΔY) is ample.

We close this section with an easy corollary of Theorem [\ref=06].

Let (X,Δ) be a projective klt pair such that - (KX  +  Δ) is semi-ample. Let n be a positive integer such that n(KX  +  Δ) is Cartier. Then there is an effective [formula]-divisor ΔY on

[formula]

such that (Y,ΔY) is klt and - (KY  +  ΔY) is ample.

By definition, Y is a normal projective variety and there is a projective surjective morphism f:X  →  Y with connected fibers such that [formula], where H is an ample [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor on Y. Then we can apply Theorem [\ref=06].

Fano and weak Fano manifolds

In this section, we apply Kawamata's positivity theorem to smooth projective morphisms between smooth projective varieties.

We note that the statement of the following theorem is weaker than [\cite=debarre]. However, the proof of Theorem [\ref=01] has potential for further generalizations. We describe it in details.

Let f:X  →  Y be a smooth projective morphism between smooth projective varieties with connected fibers. If - KX is semi-ample, then - KY is nef.

Let C be an integral curve on Y. Let A be a general member of the free linear system | - mKX|. Then there is a non-empty Zariski open set U of Y such that [formula] and that A is smooth over U. By construction, [formula]. Let μ:Y'  →  Y be a resolution such that μ is an isomorphism over U and [formula] is a simple normal crossing divisor on Y'. We consider the following commutative diagram.

[formula]

We note that [formula] is smooth. We write KY'  =  μ*KY + E. Then [formula], where [formula] is the exceptional locus of μ, and E is effective. We put

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Note that [formula]. We put U' = μ- 1(U). Then μ:U'  →  U is an isomorphism. Let [formula] be a resolution such that ψ is an isomorphism over [formula] and that [formula] is a simple normal crossing divisor, where A' is the strict transform of A on X' and [formula]. We define

[formula]

We can write

[formula]

as in Kawamata's positivity theorem (see Theorem [\ref=ka-th]). We put [formula], where Ei is a prime divisor for every i and Ei  ≠  Ej for i  ≠  j. The coefficient of Ei in Δ0 is 1 - ci, where

[formula]

By construction,

[formula]

Since

[formula]

and [formula] is effective, we can write ci = ei + ai for some [formula] with ai  ≤  1. Thus, we have 1 - ci = 1 - ei - ai. Therefore, the coefficient of Ei in E + Δ0 is

[formula]

So, we can see that E + Δ0 is effective. Since [formula] and KY'  =  μ*KY + E, we have

[formula]

Let C' be the strict transform of C on Y'. Then

[formula]

It is because M is nef and [formula]. Therefore, - KY is nef.

We give a very important remark on Theorem [\ref=01].

We use the same notation as in Theorem [\ref=01] and its proof. It is conjectured that the M is semi-ample (see, for example [\cite=ambro1]). Some very special cases of this conjecture were treated in [\cite=fujino-nagoya] before [\cite=ambro1]. Unfortunately, the results in [\cite=fujino-nagoya] are useless for our purposes here. If this semi-ampleness conjecture is solved, then we will obtain that - KY is semi-ample.

Let y∈Y be an arbitrary point. We can choose A such that y∈U. Since

[formula]

E + Δ0 is effective, and [formula], we can find a positive integer m and an effective Cartier divisor D on Y such that - mKY  ~  D and that [formula]. It implies that - KY is semi-ample.

By [\cite=kawamata1], M is semi-ample if dim Y =  dim X - 1. Therefore, - KY is semi-ample when dim Y =  dim X - 1.

In [\cite=ambro2], Ambro proved that M is nef and abundant. So, if Y is a surface, then we can check that - KY is semi-ample as follows. If ν(Y',M) = κ(Y',M) = 0 or 1, then M is semi-ample. Therefore, we can apply the same argument as above. If ν(Y',M) = κ(Y',M) = 2, then M is big. Since

[formula]

and E + Δ0 is effective, -  μ*KY is big. Therefore, - KY is nef and big. In this case, - KY is semi-ample by the Kawamata-Shokurov base point free theorem. Anyway, for an arbitrary point y∈Y, we can always find a positive integer m and an effective Cartier divisor D on Y such that - mKY  ~  D and that [formula]. It means that - KY is semi-ample.

In the end, in Theorem [\ref=01], - KY is semi-ample if dim Y  ≤  2. By combining the above results, we know that - KY is semi-ample when dim X  ≤  4. We conjecture that - KY is semi-ample if - KX is semi-ample without any assumptions on dimensions.

In Remark [\ref=011], we used Ambro's results in [\cite=ambro1] and [\cite=ambro2]. When we investigate the moduli part M on Y by the theory of variations of Hodge structures, we note the following construction. Let π:V  →  X be a cyclic cover associated to [formula]. In this case, π is a finite cyclic cover which is ramified only along [formula]. Since [formula] is relatively normal crossing over U, we can construct a simultaneous resolution [formula] and make the union of the exceptional locus and the inverse image of [formula] a simple normal crossing divisor and relatively normal crossing over U by the canonical desingularization theorem. Therefore, the moduli part M on X behaves well under pull-backs. It is a very important remark.

The semi-ampleness of - KY is not so obvious even when [formula]. The proof of the following theorem depends on some deep results on the theory of variations of Hodge structures (cf. [\cite=ambro2] and [\cite=fujino-ka]).

Let f:X  →  Y be a smooth projective morphism between smooth projective varieties. Assume that [formula]. Then - KY is semi-ample.

By the Stein factorization (cf. Lemma [\ref=04]), we can assume that f has connected fibers. In this case, we can write

[formula]

where M is the moduli part. By [\cite=ambro2], we know that M is nef and abundant. Therefore, - KY is nef and abundant. This implies that - KY is semi-ample by [\cite=fujino-ka].

The following theorem is one of the main results of this paper. We note that it was proved by Yasutake in a special case where f:X  →  Y is a [formula]-bundle (cf. [\cite=yasutake]).

Let f:X  →  Y be a smooth projective morphism between smooth projective varieties. If X is a weak Fano manifold, then so is Y.

By taking the Stein factorization, we can assume that f has connected fibers (cf. Lemma [\ref=04]). By Theorem [\ref=01], - KY is nef since - KX is semi-ample by the Kawamata-Shokurov base point free theorem. By Kodaira's lemma, we can find an effective [formula]-divisor Δ on X such that (X,Δ) is klt and that - (KX  +  Δ) is ample. By Theorem [\ref=06], we can find an effective [formula]-divisor ΔY such that - (KY  +  ΔY) is ample. Therefore, - KY is big. So, - KY is nef and big. This means that Y is a weak Fano manifold.

The following example is due to Hiroshi Sato.

Let Σ be the fan in [formula] whose rays are generated by

[formula]

and their maximal cones are

[formula]

Let Δ be the fan obtained from Σ by successive star subdivisions along the rays spanned by

[formula]

and

[formula]

We see that V = X(Σ), the toric threefold corresponding to the fan Σ with respect to the lattice [formula], is a [formula]-bundle over [formula]. We note that the [formula]-bundle structure V  →  Y is induced by the projection [formula]. The toric variety X = X(Δ) corresponding to the fan Δ was obtained by successive blow-ups from V. We can check that X is a three-dimensional toric weak Fano manifold and that the induced morphism f:X  →  Y is a flat morphism onto Y since every fiber of f is one-dimensional. It is easy to see that - KY is big but not nef.

Therefore, if f is only flat, then - KY is not always nef even when X is a weak Fano manifold.

Let us give a new proof of the well-known theorem by Kollár, Miyaoka, and Mori (cf. [\cite=kmm]). We note that Y is not always Fano if f is only flat. There exists an example in [\cite=wis].

Let f:X  →  Y be a smooth projective morphism between smooth projective varieties. If X is a Fano manifold, then so is Y.

By taking the Stein factorization, we can assume that f has connected fibers (cf. Lemma [\ref=04]). By Theorem [\ref=02], - KY is nef and big. Therefore, - KY is semi-ample by the Kawamata-Shokurov base point free theorem. Thus, it is sufficient to see that C  ·  ( - KY) > 0 for every integral curve C on Y. Let C be an integral curve C on Y. We take a general very ample divisor H on Y. Let ε be a small positive rational number. Then KX  +  εf*H is anti-ample. Let A be a general member of the free linear system | - m(KX  +  εf*H)|. We can assume that there is a non-empty Zariski open set U of Y such that H is smooth on U, [formula] is simple normal crossing on f- 1(U), [formula] is smooth over U, and [formula]. Apply the same arguments as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=01] to

[formula]

Then we obtain a projective birational morphism μ:Y'  →  Y from a smooth projective variety Y' such that μ is an isomorphism over U and [formula]-divisors Δ0 and M on Y' as before. By construction, Δ0 contains εH', where H' is the strict transform of H on Y' (cf. the proof of Theorem [\ref=06]). Therefore, we have

[formula]

as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=01]. Thus, - KY is ample.

We can prove the following theorem by the same arguments. It is a generalization of Theorem [\ref=03].

Let f:X  →  Y be a smooth projective morphism between smooth projective varieties. Let H be an ample Cartier divisor on Y. Assume that - (KX  +  εf*H) is semi-ample for some positive rational number ε. Then - KY is ample, that is, Y is a Fano manifold.

By Lemma [\ref=04], we can assume that f has connected fibers. By Theorem [\ref=06], we see that - KY is big. By the proof of Theorem [\ref=03], we can see that C  ·  ( - KY) > 0 for every integral curve C on Y. By the Kawamata-Shokurov base point free theorem, - KY is semi-ample. Thus, - KY is ample.

Comments and Questions

In this section, we will work over an algebraically closed field k of arbitrary characteristic. We denote the characteristic of k by [formula].

We close this section with a remark on Lemma [\ref=04]. It may be indispensable when [formula].

Lemma [\ref=04] holds true even when [formula]. We can check it as follows. By the proof of Lemma [\ref=04], it is sufficient to see that f*OX is locally free and [formula] for every closed point y∈Y. Without loss of generality, we can assume that Y is affine. Let us check that the natural map

[formula]

is surjective for every y∈Y. We take an arbitrary closed point y∈Y. We can replace Y with [formula]. Let my be the maximal ideal corresponding to y∈Y. We note that [formula], where [formula] is the formal completion of f*OX at y. By the theorem on formal functions (cf. [\cite=hartshorne]), we have

[formula]

where [formula]. Therefore, we can see that

[formula]

is surjective. It is because H0(Xyi,OXyi) = k for every i, where [formula] is the irreducible decomposition of a smooth variety Xy. By the base change theorem (cf. [\cite=hartshorne]), we obtain the desired results.

Appendix

In this appendix, we give another proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1] depending on mod p reduction arguments. This proof is not related to Kawamata's positivity theorem.

First let us recall various results without proofs for the reader's convenience.

Let us start the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1].

First, we note that - KX is semi-ample by the Kawamata-Shokurov base point free theorem and that - KY is nef by Theorem [\ref=kmm1]. It is sufficient to show that ( - KY)dim Y > 0. By the Stein factorization, we can assume that f has connected fibers. We can take a finitely generated [formula]-algebra A, a non-empty affine open set [formula], and smooth morphisms φ:X  →  U and ψ:Y  →  U such that

[formula]

and F≃f over the generic point of U and that - KX is semi-ample. We take a general closed point [formula]. Note that the residue field [formula] of [formula] has positive characteristic p. Let fp:Xp  →  Yp be the fiber of F at [formula], and let K be an algebraic closure of k. By Theorem [\ref=ss3], we may assume that Xp is globally F-regular. Let [formula] be the base change of fp by [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. Since - KX is semi-ample, we see that [formula] is semi-ample. In particular, [formula] is nef. Hence, we obtain that [formula] is nef by Theorem [\ref=kmm1]. By Lemma [\ref=change], - KYp is nef. By Theorem [\ref=ss2], Yp is globally F-regular. Hence - KYp is nef and big. Thus [formula]. Since ψ is flat, [formula]. Therefore, - KY is nef and big.
