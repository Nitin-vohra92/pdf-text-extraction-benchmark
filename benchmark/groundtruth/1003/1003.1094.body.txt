Principal forms X2 + nY2 representing many integers

Introduction

It is a classical result of Landau [\cite=L] from 1908 that the number B(x) of integers less than or equal to x which are representable as the sum of two squares X2 + Y2 satisfies the asymptotic formula

[formula]

with the constant where p denotes a prime. Independently, Ramanujan in his first letter to Hardy in 1913 stated essentially that Later claims by Hardy [\cite=Hardy] that Ramanujan's integral did not give a better estimate of B(x) than Landau's simpler formula were shown to be false by Shanks [\cite=shanks]. The constant C is now called the Landau-Ramanujan constant.

Consider a primitive quadratic form f(X,Y) = aX2  +  bXY  +  cY2 over [formula] with non-square discriminant D = b2 - 4ac, and suppose f is positive in case it is definite. Let Bf(x) be the number of positive integers less than or equal to x which are representable by f. Paul Bernays, a doctoral student of Landau's at Göttingen, proved the following generalization of ([\ref=lan]) in his 1912 thesis [\cite=B]:

[formula]

with a non-zero constant C(D) depending only on D. Thus C( - 4) is the Landau-Ramanujan constant. Bernays did not explicitly give C(D) for any other value of D. The problem of computing these constants has subsequently attracted considerable attention.

The original method of Landau can be used to compute C(D) when the class number h(D) is 1 or, with some additional complications, not too big. In 1966, Shanks and Schmid [\cite=ss] studied the forms f(X,Y) = X2  +  nY2 and determined the corresponding constants C( - 4n) (bn in their notation) in this way for 30 values of n in the range - 34  ≤  n  ≤  256 with class numbers h( - 4n) = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8. In particular they find

[formula]

They then state (page 561) "We note, in passing, that of all binary forms u2  +  nv2, u2  +  2v2 is the most populous, since b2 is the largest of these constants." It is not completely clear as to whether they meant that C( - 8) is the largest amongst the values computed or that the maximum value of C( - 4n) as n ranges over all integers is assumed for n = 2. In any case, this quote motivates the following question: Is C( - 8) the maximum value? The purpose of the present paper is to answer this question. Specifically we prove: Theorem 1.1 If Δ is a fixed negative fundamental discriminant, then C(Δq) is unbounded as q runs through the primes congruent to 1 modulo 4. If Δ is a fixed positive fundamental discriminant or 1, then C( - Δq) is unbounded as q runs through the primes congruent to 3 modulo 4. It follows for example that C( - 4q) is unbounded as q runs through the primes congruent to 1 modulo 4. However, it is not easy finding a concrete such q with C( - 4q) > C( - 8). We have been able to find only one such example, namely

[formula]

In Section [\ref=twee] we present a formula for C(D) in the case D is a fundamental discriminant and sketch how it is derived. In Section [\ref=drie] we discuss computational aspects of this formula. In Section [\ref=vier] we prove Theorem 1.1 by making some adjustments in a proof of Joshi [\cite=Joshi]. In the final section we formulate some further problems and questions related to C(D).

Making C(D) explicit

Using results of Kaplan and Williams [\cite=kw] and Sun and Williams [\cite=sw], an explicit formula for Bernays' constant C(D) for discriminants D < 0 was given in [\cite=mo] (see (2.5), (2.8), and (2.11)). When D is a fundamental discriminant, i.e., equal to the discriminant of a quadratic number field, this formula reduces to

[formula]

Here ω(D) is the number of prime divisors in D, φ is Euler's phi function, L(   ·   ,χD) is the Dirichlet L-series corresponding to the Kronecker symbol χD = (D /    ·   ), and E(D) is the Euler product

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

and thus the contribution of E(D) to C(D) is limited.

We will now sketch some arguments that go into the derivation of ([\ref=bern]). Recall that a primitive positive definite quadratic form aX2 + bXY + cY2,

[formula]

is the principal form. Finally, we say that an integer m is represented by the genus G if it is represented by at least one class in G. For example, if n = 14 (and thus D =  - 56 and h(D) = 4), then we have two genera G1 and G2 where, say, (the class of)

[formula]

belong to G1 while

[formula]

belong to G2.

Let us first consider the simpler problem of deriving an analogue of ([\ref=paulc]) with Bf'(x) instead of Bf(x), where Bf'(x) counts the number of integers m  ≤  x represented by f with (m,D) = 1. Note that without loss of generality we may assume that f is reduced. Let f belong to the genus G. The counting strategy is as follows:

Compute BD'(x); the number of integers m  ≤  x coprime to D that are represented by any reduced form of discriminant D.

Compute BG'(x); the number of integers m  ≤  x coprime to D that are represented by G.

Compute Bf'(x),

where the result of each step provides input for the next. We now proceed through these steps.

(1) An integer m  ≤  x is counted if and only if its prime divisors that occur to an odd power satisfy (D / p) = 1. The associated L-series [formula] thus has, for Re(s) > 1, the following Euler product: Using the Euler product formula for ζ(s) and L(s,χD) one finds, for Re(s) > 1, that say. Then using the Selberg-Delange method (see, e.g., [\cite=FMS]), one finds that

[formula]

where

[formula]

the James constant, who first established this result [\cite=James] (from a modern perspective this result is completely standard). For different proofs see [\cite=mo] [\cite=williams]. The [formula] is due to the fact that asymptotically half of the primes are represented by a reduced binary quadratic form. If we have many small primes p with (D / p) = 1, then L(1,χD) is large on the one hand, and on the other many integers m are counted by BD'(x). Thus it is natural to expect that J(D) scales as an increasing function of L(1,χD). (2) Any integer coprime to D is represented by at most one genus. Bernays showed that, as x tends to infinty, the integers m  ≤  x become equidistributed over the genera, that is, we have

[formula]

(3) We let E be the set of integers that are represented by G, but not by f, and E(x) the associated counting function (for example, in the above example 2 and 7 are represented by G1, but not by

[formula]

B'(x)~ B'(x)~.

Computation of C(D)

The class numbers h(D) can be computed for about |D| < 1020 by GP/PARI. In order to compute C(D) accurately, the problem thus lies in computing the Euler product E(D). Taking the product over, say, the first 100,000 primes gives a precision of about 6 decimals. A much better precision is obtained by the rapidly converging infinite product (see [\cite=shanks] or [\cite=mo]) However, the values L(2k,χD) can be computed only for about |D| < 106 by GP/PARI .

Using the above formulas, we compute C(D) for some small fundamental discriminants D < 0 ordered according as to whether ω(D) is 1, 2, 3, or 4:

[formula]

It appears that 21 - ω(D) tends to dominate the other factors in ([\ref=bern]). We have ω(D) = 1 when D is of the form - q for a prime [formula]. It is straightforward to find such primes with C( - q) > C( - 8), for example q = 47, 71, 167, 191 or 239. The largest value of C( - q) with q < 109, which is also the largest value of C(D) that we know, is

[formula]

But already for ω(D) = 2 it becomes much more difficult to find a D with C(D) > C( - 8), and the only example we know is ([\ref=q]). The difficulty in finding such examples is explained by the fact that

[formula]

grows very slowly with x. For example, Bateman, Erdös, and Chowla [\cite=BCE] proved

[formula]

Moreover, assuming a suitable generalized Riemann hypothesis, Littlewood [\cite=little] showed

[formula]

with D running through negative fundamental discriminants. The left-hand inequality in ([\ref=Litt]) was shown unconditionally by Chowla [\cite=Chowla] (see also the discussion in [\cite=BCE]). Recent work by Granville and Soundararajan [\cite=Granville] gives strong evidence via a probabilistic model that eγ is in fact the true limit superior of L(1,χD) /  log  log |D|.

Regarding small values of C(D), we mention that it was shown in [\cite=mo] that [formula] is minimal for D =  - 3 as D ranges over all negative discriminants, and that accordingly of all the two-dimensional lattices of covolume 1, the hexagonal lattice has asymptotically the fewest distances.

Proof of Theorem 1.1

In order to prove Theorem 1.1, we need to show that L(1,χD) is unbounded when D runs through a certain subset of discriminants. In this direction, it is proved in [\cite=BCE] that

[formula]

where D runs through fundamental discriminants of the form D =  - q with [formula] prime. This implies that C(D) is unbounded, but says nothing about discriminants of the form D =  - 4n. Our main interest is in a result of Joshi [\cite=Joshi] in which she improved ([\ref=ok]) by removing the factor 18 (for a quantitative version of this result, see [\cite=cook]). It turns out that one can make suitable adjustments to Joshi's proof in order to prove the following: Theorem 3.1. Let Δ be a fundamental discriminant or 1, let c and d be coprime integers with d divisible by Δ and 8, let q run through the primes congruent to c ( d), and let χ be the Kronecker character (Δq*  /     ·   ) with q*  =  λq, λ = ( - 1)(c - 1) / 2. Then

[formula]

where c*  =  λc and γ is Euler's constant. Note that this is close to being best possible, cf. ([\ref=Litt]). Proof of Theorem 3.1. The theorem is a generalization of [\cite=Joshi] which corresponds to the case Δ = 1. As the proof is a modification of Joshi's argument, we give the necessary changes.

Fix some (small) ε > 0. It suffices to show that for every (large) x there exists a prime q  ≤  x, [formula], such that

[formula]

We prove ([\ref=start]) by constructing a set Σ  =  Σ(x) of primes q  ≤  x, [formula], with S = |Σ| and showing

[formula]

Put

[formula]

and let [formula] be the primes not greater than y and not dividing d. Define r as in [\cite=Joshi], and let [formula]. For each i  ≠  r, let gi (respectively hi) be a quadratic residue (respectively non-residue) modulo pi. Let l  ≤  k be the unique positive integer satisfying [formula] and

[formula]

Define

[formula]

Then every q∈Σ satisfies [formula] and χ(pi) = 1 for i  ≠  r since

[formula]

So far, the only difference compared with Joshi's proof is the definition of l and χ (in [\cite=Joshi], χ is the character [formula] corresponding to Δ = 1). The different definition of l plays no role other than guaranteeing that we still have χ(pi) = 1, cf. [\cite=Joshi]. Hence, as in [\cite=Joshi], we get

[formula]

where We now show R = o(S) and hence ([\ref=key]) by splitting the summation over p into five intervals [formula] and thus writing [formula] with

The estimation of R1 and R2 is practically the same as in Joshi's paper, only one has to replace [formula] by [formula] in [\cite=Joshi] and the equation below that, which makes no difference since the sign of that factor plays no role anyway. The estimation of R3 is exactly the same since it relies on the majorization

[formula]

The estimation of R4 requires some more care since it relies on the large sieve as stated in [\cite=Joshi] which works only for prime moduli. Put β = 2 + ε- 1 and subdivide I4 into intervals Jt each containing Zt primes as in [\cite=Joshi]. Then [\cite=Joshi] remains valid, i.e.

[formula]

Let J+t and J-t denote the sets of primes in Jt with [formula] and [formula], respectively. Then Zt = Z+t  +  Z-t where Z+t and Z-t are defined analogously. Also, let Zt(a,q) be the number of p in Jt which are congruent to a modulo q, and similarly write Zt(a,q) = Z+t(a,q) + Z-t(a,q). Then a computation using the large sieve, cf. [\cite=Joshi], shows

[formula]

and similarly with the summation over p∈J-t. Since [formula], we now get

[formula]

From [\eqref=O] and [\eqref=OO] follows

[formula]

and thus

[formula]

Finally, the estimation of R5 can be carried out as in [\cite=Joshi] by writing

[formula]

and using [\cite=Joshi]. Proof of Theorem 1.1. If Δ is a negative fundamental discriminant, then let c = 1 and d be divisible by Δ and 8. Hence Theorem 3.1 implies that for χ  =  χD, D = Δq, we have

[formula]

Applying this to ([\ref=bern]) yields the first statement. If Δ is a positive fundamental discriminant or 1, let c =  - 1 and d be divisible by Δ and 8. Applying Theorem 3.1 with D =  - Δq to ([\ref=bern]) implies the second statement.

Outlook

We focused on large values of C(Δq). Likewise, one might ask about small values. Is it true for example that lim  inf C(Δq) = 0 as q runs over the primes congruent to 1 modulo 4? Is C(Δq) constant on average? Likewise one can consider our table and wonder whether the values in a column are constant on average. If so, will this constant be zero or not? Perhaps variations of the techniques in [\cite=Granville] can be used to study this. A further open problem is to determine whether Bf(x) is asymptotically better approximated by [formula] or C(D)x log - 1 / 2x. Finally, it might be of interest to recover C(D) for any discriminant D < 0 using sieve methods. For example, the Landau-Ramanujan constant C was verified (see [\cite=iwaniec]) using the half-dimensional sieve.
