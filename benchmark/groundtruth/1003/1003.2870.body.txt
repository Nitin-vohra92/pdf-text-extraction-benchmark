The 2010 outburst of the recurrent nova U Scorpii was discovered by B.G. Harris (New Smyrna Beach, FL, USA) on Jan. 28.4385 UT, when the star was measured at V=8.05 (cf Schaefer 2010). On Jan 27.63 UT, i.e. 0.80 days earlier, the nova was still at quiescence brightness (V  ≥  16.5 mag, Linnolt 2010).

This is the 10th recorded outburst of U Scorpii. Previous ones occurred on 1863, 1906, 1917, 1936, 1945, 1969, 1979, 1987 and 1999 according to the recent summary by Schaefer (2009). The last outburst has been the best observed one, with detailed reports being provided by Munari U. et al. (1999), Kiyota (1999), Lépine et al. (1999), Anupama and Dewangan (2000), Hachisu et al. (2000), Evans et al. (2001) and Iijima (2002).

We obtained accurate BVRCIC of U Sco with a 0.30-m Meade RCX-400 f/8 Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope equipped with a SBIG ST-9 CCD camera. The photometry was accurately corrected for color equations using nightly calibration on Landolt (1992) standard stars. The data are presented in Table 1, and plotted in Figure 1. The external errors (always less than 0.02 mag) do not exceed the dimension of the symbols in Figure 1.

In Figure 1 the time is counted from the discovery of U Sco in outburst on Jan. 28.4385 UT (t=0.00 days), that we assume as the time of actual maximum, there being no earlier observations of U Sco or reporting it brighter than V=8.05. The lightcurve in Figure 1 is charaterized by a smooth decline, similar to that of previous outbursts (cf Munari et al. 1999; Kiyota 1999). The decline times (±  0.1 days) are:

that are significantly slower than t2=1.2, t3=2.6 days reported by Schaefer (2009) as typical values for previous outbursts, and instead much closer to the t2=2.2, t3=4.3 days derived by Munari et al. (1999) for the 1999 outburst. The light-curve in Figure 1 exhibits a plateau phase extending from day +12 to day +20, during which the mean colors are

[formula]

This phase corresponds to the white dwarf still burning hydrogen in the envelope and the ejecta being transparent to soft X-rays. In fact, on day +12, Schlegel et al. (2010) found U Sco to have become a super-soft X-ray source with a brightness 100 time larger than a previous observation on day +8. Osborne et al. (2010) found U Sco still in super-soft conditions at day +17.5. A plateau was observed also during the 1999 outburst (Kiyota 1999, and Hachisu et al. 2000), but at a fainter mean magnitude (<  V  >  =14.75), lasting slightly longer (11 days) and starting appreciably later, on day +17.

With a 0.40-m f/8 Ritchey-Chrétien telescope located on Monte Baldo (Verona, Italy), and equipped with a Finger Lake Instruments ML1001E CCD camera, we carried out three runs in B and IC filters looking for short time variations in U Sco. The results are presented in Figure 2.

No flickering was detected on day +4.8, while the short term variability was clearly present on day +11.8 (at the beginning of the plateau phase). Worters et al. (2010) reported that the flickering became visible on day +8, and they attributed it to an accretion disk that had already been re-established and was visible through optically thin ejecta. Our last observing run on day +15.7 (and additional three scattered points around day +19.8), at the center of the plateau phase, did not however show any short term variability, which cast doubts on the Worters et al. interpretation in terms of re-established accretion. The flickering we observed had a characteristic time scale of ~  half an hour, and a larger amplitude in IC (Δm=1.0 mag) than in B band (Δm=0.5 mag).
