A class of quantum gate entangler

Introduction

Multipartite entangled quantum states are very important resources in quantum information processing. A quantum computer can be constructed by quantum gates and one special class of these gates is called quantum gate entanglers. It also would be interesting if these quantum gate entanglers are able to produce any class of multipartite entangled quantum states. Recently, we have proposed different methods to construct quantum gate entanglers for multi-qubits states [\cite=Hosh1]. We have also discussed some classes of quantum gate entangler based on different classes of positive operator on quantum phase (POVM) [\cite=Hosh2]. In this paper, in continuation of previous works, we discuss the construction quantum gate entangler for multi-qubit states. In particular, in this section, we present necessary tools for designing some classes of quantum gate entanglers. Then, in section [\ref=sec:1] we will construct quantum gate entanglers for multi-qubit states. Finally, in section [\ref=sec:2], we will in detail discuss quantum gate entanglers for four-qubit states.

Let a state of a pure multi-qubit quantum system [formula] be given by

[formula]

defined on a Hilbert space [formula]. Moreover, let [formula] be a gate that acts on a qubit as Z|0〉 = |0〉 and Z|1〉 =  - |1〉. Then, a controlled phase gate is defined by [formula], where I2 is a 2-by-2 identity matrix [\cite=Ohmi] [\cite=Chen].

Next, we will review the basic definition and property of a general POVM on quantum phase [\cite=Hosh3]. This POVM is a set of linear operators [formula] [formula] that gives the probabilistic measurement of a state ρQj on the Hilbert space HQj

[formula]

where [formula] are the outcomes of the measurement of the quantum phase. This POVM satisfies the following properties, [formula] is self-adjoint, positive, and normalized, that is

[formula]

where the integral extends over any 2π intervals. A general and symmetric POVM in a single Nj-dimensional Hilbert space HQj is given by

[formula]

where kj < lj. The POVM is a function of the Nj(Nj - 1) / 2 phases [formula] [formula]. It is also possible to define POVM for a multipartite system by simply forming the tensor product

[formula]

where, e.g., φk1,l1 is the set of POVMs phase associated with subsystems Q1, for all [formula], where we need only to consider when l1 > k1.

Quantum gate entangler for multipartite states

In this section, first we will review the construction of concurrence classes for a pure multi-qubit states [\cite=Hosh4]. Then, we will propose quantum gate entanglers for multi-qubit states. The unique structure of our POVM enables us to distinguish different classes of multipartite states. In the m-partite case, the off-diagonal elements of the matrix

[formula]

have phases that are sum or differences of phases originating from two and m subsystems. That is, in the later case the phases of [formula] take the form [formula]. Thus, we have proposed linear operators for the Wm class based on our POVM which are sum and difference of phases of two subsystems, i.e., (φkr1,lr1  ±  φkr2,lr2). That is, for the Wm class we have

[formula]

For the GHZm class, we also have proposed linear operators based on our POVM which are sum and difference of phases of m-subsystems, i.e., [formula]. That is, for the GHZm class we have

[formula]

where by choosing φπkj,lj  =  π for all [formula], we get an operator which has the structure of Pauli operator σx embedded in a higher-dimensional Hilbert space and coincides with σx for a single-qubit.

Moreover, we have proposed linear operators for the GHZm - 1 class of m-partite states based on our POVM which are sum and difference of phases of m - 1-subsystems, i.e., [formula]. That is, for the GHZm - 1 class we have

[formula]

where [formula].

Based on these operators we have constructed concurrence classes for multi-qubit states. For example, for Wm class let

[formula]

Then the Wm class concurrence is given by

[formula]

where NWm is a normalization constant. Note that for m-partite states the Wm class concurrences are zero only for completely separable states.

Now, we propose the following class of quantum gate entanglers for multi-qubit states. Let Z2m  ×  2m be defined by

[formula]

where [formula] for all [formula] is a swap gate. Then, [formula] is entangled and belong to [formula] class if elements of Z2m  ×  2m satisfy [formula], where e.g., [formula] denotes the [formula] or [formula] classes of multipartite systems. In the next section we will give an illustrative example of four-qubit quantum gate entanglers.

Quantum gate entangler for four-qubit states

For general four-partite states we have three different joint phases in our POVM which give W4, GHZ3, and GHZ4 class of operators. For the W4 class, we have six types of entanglement, so there are six operators corresponding to entanglement between Q1Q2, Q1Q3, Q1Q4, Q2Q3, Q2Q4, and Q3Q4 subsystems. The linear operator corresponding to Q1Q2 is given by

[formula]

[formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula] are defined in similar way. Now, for a pure four-qubit quantum system let

[formula]

Then, the state [formula] is entangled and belong to [formula] class if elements of

[formula]

satisfy [formula]. The second class of four-partite state that we want to consider is the GHZ3 class. For this class, we have four types of entanglement. These linear operators are given by

[formula]

[formula]

[formula] and [formula] can be defined in similar way. Moreover, with

[formula]

the state [formula] is entangled and belong to [formula] class if elements of Z24  ×  24 satisfy [formula]. Next we are going to consider the GHZ4class concurrence for general four-partite states. For the GHZ4 class, we have six linear operators corresponding to entanglement between these subsystems. For example, the linear operator corresponding to (Q1Q2)Q3Q4 is given by

[formula]

[formula] [formula], and [formula] are defined in a similar way. Now, let

[formula]

Then, for [formula] class the state [formula] is entangled if elements of Z24  ×  24 satisfy [formula].

Conclusion

In this paper, we have constructed a class of quantum gate entanglers for multi-qubit quantum states. Our construction was based on complement of POVM on quantum phase. By considering the quantum relative phase of multi-qubit states we were able to propose a set of unitary operators that could entangle different classes of multi-qubit states. The result is interesting for the construction of distributed quantum computing and quantum control.
