The expression of Moore-Penrose inverse of A - XY*

Introduction

Let A be a nonsingular m  ×  m matrix and X,  Y be two m  ×  n matrices. It is known that A - XY* is nonsingular iff In  -  Y*A- 1X is nonsingular, and in which case the well known Shermen-Morrison-Woodbury formula (SMW) can be expressed as

[formula]

This formula and some related formula have a lot of applications in statistics, networks, optimization and partial differential equations. Please see [\cite=HS] [\cite=KR] [\cite=WWH] for details. Clearly, the formula ([\ref=EQ]) fails when A or A - XY* is singular. Steerneman and Kleij in [\cite=TFP] proved that when A is singular and In  -  Y*A+X is nonsingular, then under conditions that

[formula]

He also showed that if A is nonsingular and Y*A- 1X = In, then

[formula]

where X1 = A- 1X, ~  ~ Y1 = (A- 1)*Y (cf. [\cite=TFP]).

Recently Chen, Hu and Xu studied the Moore-Penrose inverse of A - XY* when A∈L(H) and X,Y∈L(K,H) in [\cite=CHX]. They prove that if A is invertible and A - XY*, ~ X, ~ Y have closed ranges, then iff Y*1XY*1 = Y*1, XY*1X = X,where X1 = A- 1X, ~  ~ Y1 = (A- 1)*Y. This result generalizes Theorem 3 of [\cite=TFP].

In this paper we assume that A∈L(H) and X,Y∈L(K,H) with R(A) closed and R(X)  ⊆  R(A),R(Y)  ⊆  R(A*). We prove that if XY*A+XY* = XY* and if XY*A+X = X and Y*A+XY* = Y*. These expressions generalize corresponding expressions of (A - XY*)+ given in [\cite=CHX] and [\cite=TFP].

preliminaries

Let T∈L(K,H), denote by R(T) (resp. N(T)) the range (resp. kernal) of T. Let A∈L(H). Recall from [\cite=WG] that B∈L(H) is the Moore-Penrose inverse of A, if B satisfies the following equations: In this case B is denote by A+. It is well-known A has the Moore-Penrose inverse iff R(A) is closed in H. When A+ exists, R(A+) = R(A*), ~ N(A+) = N(A*) and (A+)* = (A*)+.

Let A∈L(H) with R(A) closed and X,Y∈L(K,H) (1)  R(X)  ⊆  R(A) iff AA+X = X,  R(Y)  ⊆  R(A*) iff Y*A+A = Y*. (2)  Suppose that R(X)  ⊆  R(A) and R(Y)  ⊆  R(A*) then iff XY*A+XY* = XY*.

Proof. (1) Since R(A) = R(AA+) and R(A*) = R(A+A), the assertion follows.

(2) Using (1), we can check directly that (A - XY*)A+(A - XY*) = (A - XY*) if and only if XY*A+XY* = XY*.

In order to compute (A - XY*)+, we need the following two lemmas which come from [\cite=WXQ].

Let S∈L(H) be an idempotent operator. Denote by O(S) the orthogonal projection of H onto R(S). Then I - S - S* is invertible in L(H) and O(S) =  - S(I - S - S*)- 1.

Let T, ~ B∈L(H) with TBT = T, Then T+ = (I - O(I - BT))BO(TB).

Let S∈L(H) be an idempotent operator. Then O(S) = SS+ and O(I - S) = I - S+S.

Proof. S2 = S implies that R(S) is closed and [formula]. Thus, S+ exists and O(S) = SS+, O(I - S) = I - S+S.

Main results

In this section, we will generalize Eq([\ref=EQ]) and Eq([\ref=EQ2]). Firstly, we have

Let A∈L(H) with R(A) closed and X,Y∈L(K,H) with R(X)  ⊆  R(A) and R(Y)  ⊆  R(A*). Assume that I - Y*A+X is invertible in L(H). Then (A - XY*)+ exists and

[formula]

Proof. Put B = A+ + A+X(I - Y*A+X)- 1Y*A+. Simple computation shows that (A - XY*)B = AA+ and B(A - XY*) = A+A by Lemma [\ref=YL] (1). Thus,

[formula]

that is, (A - XY*)+ = B.

Now we consider the case that I - Y*A+X is not invertible, we have

Let A∈L(H) with R(A) closed and X,Y∈L(K,H) with R(X)  ⊆  R(A) and R(Y)  ⊆  R(A*).

If XY*A+XY* = XY*, then (A - XY*)+ exists and

[formula]

Especially, if XY*A+X = X and Y*A+XY* = Y*, then

[formula]

Assume that R(A - XY*), R(A+XY*) and R(XY*A+) are closed in H. Then Eq([\ref=4eq]) implies that XY*A+XY* = XY*;

Assume that R(A - XY*), R(A+X) and R(Y*A+) are closed. Then Eq([\ref=5eq]) indicates that XY*A+X = X and Y*A+XY* = Y*.

Proof. (1) In this case, (A - XY*)A+(A - XY*) = (A - XY*). Thus R(A - XY*) is closed, i.e., (A - XY*)+ exists and hence

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=YL] (2). Since (I - 2A+A)2 = I, ~  ~ (I - 2A+A)A+ =  - A+,

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

Similarly, we also have

[formula]

Therefore, we have

[formula]

From A+XY*A+XY* = XY*, we get that A+XY* and XY*A+ are all idempotent operators. It follow from Lemma [\ref=YLd] that

[formula]

Therefore, we have

[formula]

When XY*A+X = X and Y*A+XY* = Y*, we have R(A+XY*) = R(A+X) and R(I - XY*A+) = N(Y*A+) so that

[formula]

and consequently, we get ([\ref=5eq]).

(2) In this case,

[formula]

that is, [formula]. So R(A - XY*)  ⊆  N(XY*A+) and consequently, XY*A+XY* = XY*.

(3) When Eq([\ref=5eq]) holds,

[formula]

Then R(A - XY*)  ⊆  N(Y*A+) and R(A+X)  ⊆  N(A - XY*). So

[formula]

Suppose [formula] and [formula]. Let A∈L(H) and X,  Y∈L(K,H). Since

[formula]

we can express Theorem [\ref=DL] (1) as follows.

Let A be an m  ×  m matrix and X,  Y be two m  ×  n matrices. Suppose that [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

if XY*A+XY* = XY* and

[formula]

when XY*A+X = X and Y*A+XY* = Y*.

Before ending this note, we give an example as follows.

Put [formula] Then

[formula]

It is easy to verify that R(X)  ⊆  R(A), ~ R(Y)  ⊆  R(A*) and XY*A+XY* = XY*. So by Corollary [\ref=Ca], [formula]
