Itzkowitz's problem for groups of finite exponent

Introduction

Let G be a Hausdorff topological group, e its unit and N(e) the set of all neighborhoods of e in G. The left uniformity Ul of G has as a basis of entourages the sets of the form {(x,y)∈G  ×  G:x- 1y∈V}, where V is a member of N(e) (we write the law of G multiplicatively). The right uniformity Ur is obtained by writing xy- 1 in place of x- 1y (in the form above). The group G is said to be balanced, or SIN (for small invariant neighborhoods), if the two uniformities Ul and Ur coincide. As it is well known, compact groups and (obviously) Abelian topological groups are SIN. A topological group G is called functionally balanced or FSIN, if every bounded left uniformly continuous real-valued function on G is right uniformly continuous. Here, a function [formula] is left uniformly continuous if f is uniformly continuous when G is equipped with its left uniformity and the reals with the usual metric. Right uniform continuity is defined similarly. Since the inversion on G switches the left and right uniformities, the alternative right-left definition in the FSIN property leads to the same thing.

Obviously, every SIN group is an FSIN group, but it is still unknown if the converse holds for every topological group. This problem, called Itzkowitz's problem after the work [\cite=IT1], has received several positive answers in the past; the reader is referred to [\cite=BT1] and the references therein for more information and related questions about the problem. Let us just recall that it has received the attention of many authors and has been solved for two notably different classes including respectively locally compact groups and locally connected groups (see for instance [\cite=BT2] [\cite=HER] [\cite=IT2] [\cite=MIL] [\cite=PR1]). It is clear that if G is locally compact then for every positive integer p, the power map φp, defined by G∋x  →  xp∈G, is left uniformly continuous "locally", that is, when it is restricted to some neighborhood of the unit of G (just take a compact neighborhood) and G is equipped with the left uniformity. In particular, the class of groups for which there is p  ≥  2 such that the power map φp is "locally" left uniformly continuous, includes all locally compact groups. It includes also all groups of finite exponent; where a group G is said to be of finite exponent if for some p  ≥  1, xp = e for all x∈G. In connection with this, it should be noted, as it is easy to see, that a group G is SIN if and only if the power map φ2 is left uniformly continuous. This should be compared to the well-known fact that G is SIN if and only if the product map (x,y)  →  xy is left uniformly continuous; see [\cite=ROE].

The main result of this note is as follows: The equality FSIN=SIN holds in the class of topological groups G for which there are a neighborhood V of the unit and an integer p  ≥  2 such that the map φp:V  →  G is left uniformly continuous. This extends the locally compact case and allows to give an affirmative answer to Itzkovitz's question for periodic topological groups which are of the second category.

Two lemmas

In what follows, G is a fixed Hausdorff topological group. A subset A of G is called left V-thin in G, where V∈N(e), if the set [formula] is a neighborhood of e in G. If A is left V-thin in G for every V∈N(e), then A is said to be left thin in G. The concept of "right V-thin" is defined similarly. Note that the group G is SIN if and only if G is left thin in itself. The set A is said to be left (right) V-discrete in G if a = b whenever a∈bV (a∈Vb) and a,b∈A. The set A is said to be Roelcke-discrete if there is V∈N(e) such that a = b whenever a,b∈A and a∈VbV. Note that this means that A is a uniformly discrete subset of G (with respect to V) when G is equipped with the lower uniformity [formula], sometimes called the Roelcke uniformity. Finally, the set A is said to be left neutral if for every V∈N(e), there is U∈N(e) such that UA  ⊂  AV. It is well known that the group G is FSIN if and only if every subset of G is left neutral, see [\cite=PR2].

The main result is obtained as a consequence of the following lemmas.

Let [formula] (q  ≥  2) be a decreasing sequence of neighborhoods of e in G and M  ⊂  G, with V22  ⊂  V1, such that mV2i + 1  ⊂  Vim for every 1  ≤  i < q and m∈M. Suppose that there are a symmetric U∈N(e) and 2  ≤  p  ≤  q such that U  ⊂  Vp and m- p(mu)p∈Vp for every m∈M and u∈U.

Then M is right V1-thin in G.

Suppose that every Roelcke discrete subset of G is left thin in G. Let A  ⊂  G. Then, for every V∈N(e) and n  ≥  2, there are M  ⊂  AV and a decreasing sequence [formula] of arbitrary small neighborhoods of e in G (e.g. V1  ⊂  V and V22  ⊂  V1 ), such that

mV2k + 1  ⊂  Vkm for every m∈M and 1  ≤  k < n,

if M is right V-thin in G, then A is right V3-thin in G.

FSIN versus SIN

Following [\cite=ROE], a topological group G is said to be ASIN (for almost SIN), if there exists a neighborhood of the unit in G which is left (or right) thin in G. Equivalently, G is ASIN if there exists a nonempty open subset of G, which is left (or right) thin in G (indeed, if A,B  ⊂  G are left thin in G, then the set AB is left thin in G).

Suppose that there are p  ≥  2 and a nonempty open set Ω  ⊂  G such that the mapping Ω∋x  →  xp∈G is left uniformly continuous. If every Roelcke-discrete subset of G is left thin in G, then G is ASIN.

The next two lemmas correspond respectively to Proposition 3.5 and Lemma 3.3 in [\cite=BT2].

Suppose that every Roelcke-discrete subset of G is left thin in G. If G is ASIN, then G is SIN.

If G is FSIN, then every Roelcke-discrete subset of G is left thin in G.

Now, we arrive at the main result of this note.

Let G be an FSIN group. If for some p  ≥  2, the power map G∋g  →  gp∈G is left uniformly continuous when restricted to some nonempty open subset of G, then G is SIN.

It is customary to say that the topological group G is topologically torsion if for any g∈G the sequence [formula] converges to e in G. The reader is referred to [\cite=DIK] for useful generalizations of this concept. We do not know if Corollary 3.5 remains true if G is assumed to be topologically torsion. As a partial answer, we offer the following.

Suppose that G is FSIN and that there is p  ≥  2 such that for every g∈G, the sequence [formula] converges to e in G. Then G is SIN.

Let G be an FSIN group which is of finite exponent. Then G is SIN.

Clearly, Corollary 3.7 follows from both Corollary 3.5 and Proposition 3.6. It can be also deduced from the following result for which we will give a direct proof (based on Lemma 2.2).

For g∈G, the left translation lg:G  →  G is defined by lg(h) = gh. For a given A  ⊂  G, it is well known (and easy to check) that A is left thin in G if and only if the set L(A) = {lg:g∈A} is equicontinuous (at the unit e), as a set of maps from the space G to the uniform space (G,Ur). In particular, G is SIN if and only if L(G) is equicontinuous. If G is FSIN, it suffices to suppose that for some p  ≥  1, the set L({gp:g∈G}) is equicontinuous, as it is clear from the next statement.

Suppose that there is p  ≥  1 such that the set {gp:g∈G} is left thin in G. If every Roelcke-discrete subset of G is left thin in G, then G is SIN.

Recall that the group G is called periodic (or a torsion group) if every element of G is of finite order.

Suppose that G is FSIN, periodic and a Baire space. Then G is SIN.

Now, for the convenience of the reader, we cite an example of a topological group of finite exponent which is not SIN. Let S and A be two non trivial groups, with A infinite, and consider the group H = SA with the pointwise product. The map η:A  →  Aut(H) defined by η(a)(h)(b) = h(ba), a,b∈A, h∈H is an homomorphism, where Aut(H) stands for the automorphisms group of H with the composition law [formula]. Let G = H  ×  ηA be the semi-direct product group associated to (A,H,η), topologized as follows: A is discrete and H is equipped with the product topology, the group S being discrete. Then, G is not SIN; indeed, the set {e}  ×  A is neither left nor right thin in G. If [formula] and the group A is of exponent 2, then G is of exponent 4.

A concluding comment. The statements of Theorem 3.4 and Proposition 3.8 are different, although they have some common consequences (e.g. Corollary 3.7). In fact, in a way, they are complementary and we propose the following discussion to explain that. In general, a map f:(G,Ul)  →  (X,U) (where (X,U) is a uniform space) is uniformly continuous if and only if the set {fg:g∈G} of left translations of f is equicontinuous (at e). Thus, the power map φp:(G,Ul)  →  (G,Ul) is uniformly continuous if and only if the set {(φp)g:g∈G} of all left translations of φp is left equicontinuous (i.e., when G is equipped with the left uniformity). Taking in Lemma 2.1 (via Lemma 2.2) a sequence [formula] with an appropriate length, it is quite possible to weaken the assumption in Theorem 3.4 assuming only that the set {(φp)gq:g∈G} is left equicontinuous for some p  ≥  2 and q  ≥  1. On the other hand, the left thinness of the set A in Proposition 3.8 means that the set {(φ1)gp:g∈G} is right equicontinuous (i.e., when G is equipped with the right uniformity). It is again possible here to assume only that the set {(φp)gq:g∈G} is right equicontinuous for some p  ≥  1 and q  ≥  1. Acknowledgement.
