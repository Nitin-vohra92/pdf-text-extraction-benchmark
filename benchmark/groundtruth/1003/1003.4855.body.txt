Introduction

The concepts of resolvability and location in graphs were described independently by Harary and Melter [\cite=harary] and Slater [\cite=leaves-trees], to define the same structure in a graph. After these papers were published several authors developed diverse theoretical works about this topic [\cite=pelayo1] [\cite=pelayo2] [\cite=chappell] [\cite=chartrand] [\cite=chartrand1] [\cite=chartrand2] [\cite=fehr] [\cite=landmarks]. Slater described the usefulness of these ideas into long range aids to navigation [\cite=leaves-trees]. Also, these concepts have some applications in chemistry for representing chemical compounds [\cite=pharmacy1] [\cite=pharmacy2] or to problems of pattern recognition and image processing, some of which involve the use of hierarchical data structures [\cite=Tomescu1]. Other applications of this concept to navigation of robots in networks and other areas appear in [\cite=chartrand] [\cite=robots] [\cite=landmarks]. Some variations on resolvability or location have been appearing in the literature, like those about conditional resolvability [\cite=survey], locating domination [\cite=haynes], resolving domination [\cite=brigham] and resolving partitions [\cite=chappell] [\cite=chartrand2] [\cite=fehr].

Given a graph G = (V,E) and an ordered set of vertices S = {v1,v2,...,vk} of G, the metric representation of a vertex v∈V with respect to S is the vector r(v|S) = (d(v,v1),d(v,v2),...,d(v,vk)), where d(v,vi), with 1  ≤  i  ≤  k, denotes the distance between the vertices v and vi. We say that S is a resolving set of G if for every pair of distinct vertices u,v∈V, r(u|S)  ≠  r(v|S). The metric dimension of G is the minimum cardinality of any resolving set of G, and it is denoted by dim(G). The metric dimension of graphs is studied in [\cite=pelayo1] [\cite=pelayo2] [\cite=chappell] [\cite=chartrand] [\cite=chartrand1] [\cite=tomescu].

Given an ordered partition Π  =  {P1,P2,...,Pt} of the vertices of G, the partition representation of a vertex v∈V with respect to the partition Π is the vector r(v|Π) = (d(v,P1),d(v,P2),...,d(v,Pt)), where d(v,Pi), with 1  ≤  i  ≤  t, represents the distance between the vertex v and the set Pi, that is d(v,Pi) =  min u∈Pi{d(v,u)}. We say that Π is a resolving partition of G if for every pair of distinct vertices u,v∈V, r(u|Π)  ≠  r(v|Π). The partition dimension of G is the minimum number of sets in any resolving partition of G and it is denoted by pd(G). The partition dimension of graphs is studied in [\cite=chappell] [\cite=chartrand2] [\cite=fehr] [\cite=tomescu]. It is natural to think that the partition dimension and metric dimension are related; in [\cite=chartrand2] it was shown that for any nontrivial connected graph G we have

[formula]

The study of relationships between invariants of Cartesian product graphs and invariants of its factors appears frequently in research about graph theory. In the case of resolvability, the relationships between the metric dimension of the Cartesian product graphs and the metric dimension of its factors was studied in [\cite=pelayo1] [\cite=pelayo2]. An open problem on the dimension of Cartesian product graphs is to prove (or finding a counterexample) that for all pairs of graphs G,H; dim(G  ×  H)  ≤  dim(G) + dim(H). In the present paper we study the case of resolving partition in Cartesian product graphs, by giving some relationships between the partition dimension of Cartesian product graphs and the partition dimension of its factors. More precisely, we show that for all pairs of connected graphs G,H; pd(G  ×  H)  ≤  pd(G) + pd(H) and pd(G  ×  H)  ≤  pd(G) + dim(H). Consequently, we show that pd(G  ×  H)  ≤  dim(G) + dim(H) + 1.

We recall that the Cartesian product of two graphs G1 = (V1,E1) and G2 = (V2,E2) is the graph G1  ×  G2 = (V,E), such that V = {(a,b)  :  a∈V1,  b∈V2} and two vertices (a,b)∈V and (c,d)∈V are adjacent in G1  ×  G2 if and only if, either a = c and bd∈E2 or b = d and ac∈E1.

The following well known fact will be used several times.

Let the graph Gi = (Vi,Ei) and let Si  ⊂  Vi, i∈{1,2}. For every (a,b)∈V1  ×  V2, it follows dG1  ×  G2((a,b),S1  ×  S2) = dG1(a,S1) + dG2(b,S2).

The partition dimension of Cartesian product graphs

For any connected graphs G1 and G2,

[formula]

Let Π1  =  {A1,A2,...,Ak} and Π2  =  {B1,B2,...,Bt} be resolving partitions of G1 = (V1,E1) and G2 = (V2,E2) respectively. Let us show that Π  =  {A1  ×  B1,A1  ×  B2,...,A1  ×  Bt,A2  ×  B1,A3  ×  B1,...,Ak  ×  B1,C}, with [formula] is a resolving partition of G1  ×  G2.

Let (a,b), (c,d) be two different vertices of V1  ×  V2. If a = c, then there exists Bi∈Π2 such that dG2(b,Bi)  ≠  dG2(d,Bi). Hence we have

[formula]

Now, if a  ≠  c then we have the following cases:

Case 1: Let a∈Ai and c∈Aj, with i  ≠  j. If we suppose,

[formula]

and

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

a contradiction.

Case 2: If a,c∈Ai then we have the following subcases.

Case 2.1: b,d∈Bl. Let Aj∈Π1, such that dG1(a,Aj)  ≠  dG1(c,Aj). In this case, if dG2(b,B1) = dG2(d,B1) then we have

[formula]

On the contrary, if dG2(b,B1)  ≠  dG2(d,B1) then we have

[formula]

Case 2.2: b∈Bj and d∈Bl, j  ≠  l. This case is analogous to Case 1.

Therefore for every different vertices (a,b),(c,d)∈V1  ×  V2, we have r((a,b)|Π)  ≠  r((c,d)|Π).

By ([\ref=partition-dimension]) we obtain the following direct consequence of Theorem [\ref=sumapd].

For any connected graphs G1 and G2,

[formula]

As we can see below, the above relationship can be improved.

For any connected graphs G1 and G2,

[formula]

Let Π  =  {A1,A2,...,Ak} be a resolving partition of G1 = (V1,E1), let S = {u1,u2,...,ut} be a resolving set of G2 = (V2,E2) and let [formula]. Let us show that Π1  =  {A1  ×  {u1},A2  ×  {u1},...,Ak  ×  {u1},A1  ×  {u2},A1  ×  {u3},...,A1  ×  {ut},C} is a resolving partition of G1  ×  G2.

Let (a,b), (c,d) be two different vertices of V1  ×  V2. If a = c, then b  ≠  d. Thus, there exist uj∈S such that dG2(b,uj)  ≠  dG2(d,uj). Hence,

[formula]

Now, if a  ≠  c we have two cases:

Case 1: a∈Ai and c∈Aj, j  ≠  i. Let us suppose, dG2(b,u1)  ≤  dG2(d,u1). In this case we have

[formula]

Analogously, if dG2(b,u1)  ≥  dG2(d,u1) we obtain

[formula]

Case 2: a,c∈Ai. Let us suppose dG2(b,u1) = dG2(d,u1). Since there exists j  ≠  i, such that dG(a,Aj)  ≠  dG(c,Aj), we have

[formula]

If dG2(b,u1)  ≠  dG2(d,u1), we have dG1  ×  G2((a,b),Ai  ×  {u1}) = dG2(b,u1)  ≠  dG2(d,u1) = dG1  ×  G2((c,d),Ai  ×  {u1}). Therefore, for every different vertices (a,b), (c,d) we have r((a,b)|Π1)  ≠  r((c,d)|Π1).

In order to give some examples we emphasize the following well known values for the metric dimension of the complete graph, Kn, the path graph, Pn, the cycle graph, Cn, and the star graph, K1,n.

dim(Kn) = n - 1 (n  ≥  2).

dim(Pn) = 1.

dim(Cn) = 2.

dim(K1,n) = n - 1 (n  ≥  2).

We note that there are graphs for which Theorem [\ref=sumapd] estimates pd(G1  ×  G2) better than Theorem [\ref=THpartDimension] and vice versa. For example Theorem [\ref=sumapd] leads to pd(Kn  ×  Pn)  ≤  n + 2 while Theorem [\ref=THpartDimension] gives pd(Kn  ×  Pn)  ≤  n + 1. On the contrary, if G denotes the unicyclic graph described below, Theorem [\ref=sumapd] leads to pd(G  ×  G)  ≤  12 while Theorem [\ref=THpartDimension] gives pd(G  ×  G)  ≤  15. In the above example the unicyclic graph G is composed by fifteen vertices, where the set 1,2,3 form a triangle and the remaining twelve vertices are leaves: the leaves 4,5,6 and 7 are adjacent to 1, the leaves 8,9,10 and 11 are adjacent to 2, and the leaves 12,13,14 and 15 are adjacent to 3. In this case [formula] is a resolving partition and S = {4,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,14} is a resolving set.

As a direct consequence of above theorem and ([\ref=partition-dimension]) we deduce the following interesting result.

For any connected graphs G1 and G2,

[formula]

One example of graphs for which the equality holds in Corollary [\ref=sumadimen] (and also in Corollary [\ref=particulares] (ii)) are the graphs belonging to the family of grid graphs: pd(Pr  ×  Pt) = 3.

By Remark [\ref=particulares-dim] we obtain the following particular cases of Theorem [\ref=THpartDimension].

For any connected graph G,

pd(G  ×  Kn)  ≤  pd(G) + n - 1.

pd(G  ×  Pn)  ≤  pd(G) + 1.

pd(G  ×  Cn)  ≤  pd(G) + 2.

pd(G  ×  K1,n)  ≤  pd(G) + n - 1.

Open problems
