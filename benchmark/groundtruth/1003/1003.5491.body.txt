Rational formality of mapping spaces

Introduction

Let X and Y be connected spaces that have the rational homotopy type of finite CW complexes. We denote by n the maximum integer q such that [formula]. In this text we consider mapping spaces (X,Y) satisfying the following hypotheses (H).

[formula]

Under those hypotheses, (X,Y) is a nilpotent space and its rational homotopy is described by Haefliger [\cite=Ha] and Brown and Szczarba [\cite=BS].

Our main interest here is to understand when (X,Y) is a (rationally) formal space. Formality is important in rational homotopy. If a space is formal then its rational homotopy type is completely determined by its rational cohomology. More precisely a nilpotent space Z is formal if its Sullivan minimal model is quasi-isomorphic to the differential graded algebra [formula]. Many spaces coming from geometry are formal. Among formal spaces we find the spheres, the projective spaces, the products of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces, the compact Kähler manifolds ([\cite=DGMS]), and the (p - 1)-connected compact manifolds, p  ≥  2, of dimension ≤  4p - 2 [\cite=Mi].

The formality of mapping spaces has been the subject of previous works. In [\cite=DV], N. Dupont and M. Vigué-Poirrier prove that when [formula] is finitely generated, then (S1,Y) is formal if and only if Y is rationally a product of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces. In [\cite=Ya] T. Yamaguchi proves that when Y is elliptic, the formality of (X,Y) implies that Y is rationally a product of odd dimensional spheres. In [\cite=Vig] M. Vigué-Poirrier proves that if (X,Y) is formal and if the Hurewicz map [formula] is nonzero in some odd degree q, then Y has the homotopy type of a product of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces. When Y is a finite complex, we prove here that the hypothesis on the Hurewicz map is not necessary.

Theorem 1. Under the above hypotheses (H), (X,Y) is formal if and only if Y has the rational homotopy type of a product of odd dimensional spheres.

As an important step in the proof of Theorem 1 we prove

Theorem 2. If dim  Y = N, then the Hurewicz map

[formula]

is zero for q > N.

Rational homotopy

The theory of minimal models originates in the works of Sullivan [\cite=Su] and Quillen [\cite=Qu]. For recall a graded algebra A is graded commutative if ab = ( - 1)|a|  ·  |a|ba for homogeneous elements a and b. A graded commutative algebra A is free on a graded vector space V, [formula], if A is the quotient of the tensor algebra TV by the ideal generated by the elements xy - ( - 1)|x|  ·  |y|yx, x,y∈V. A (Sullivan) minimal algebra is a graded commutative differential algebra of the form [formula] where V admits a basis vi indexed by a well ordered set I with [formula]. Now if (A,d) is a graded commutative differential algebra whose cohomology is connected and finite type, there is a unique (up to isomorphism) minimal algebra [formula] with a quasi-isomorphism [formula]. The differential graded algebra [formula] is then called the (Sullivan) minimal model of (A,d).

In [\cite=Su] Sullivan associated to each nilpotent space Z a graded commutative differential algebra of rational polynomials forms on Z, APL(Z), that is a rational replacement of the algebra of de Rham forms on a manifold. The minimal model [formula] of APL(Z) is then called the minimal model of Z. More generally a model of Z is a graded commutative differential algebra quasi-isomorphic to its minimal model. For more details we refer to [\cite=Su], [\cite=FHT] and [\cite=FOT].

A space X is called (rationally) formal if its minimal model, [formula], is quasi-isomorphic to its cohomology with differential 0,

[formula]

A formal space X admits a minimal model equipped with a bigradation on V, [formula] such that [formula], and such that the bigradation induced on the homology satisfies Hqp  =  0 for p  ≠  0. This model has been constructed by Halperin and Stasheff in [\cite=HS], and is called the bigraded model of X. We will use this model for the proof of Theorem 2.

A nilpotent space X is called (rationally) elliptic if [formula] and [formula] are finite dimensional vector spaces. To be elliptic for a space X is a very restrictive condition. For instance [formula] satisfies Poincaré duality and [formula] is zero for q  ≥   2  ·   dim  X. A nilpotent space X is called (rationally) hyperbolic if [formula] is infinite dimensional and [formula] finite dimensional. The homotopy groups of elliptic and hyperbolic spaces have a completely different behavior. For instance, for an hyperbolic space X, the sequence [formula] has an exponential growth ([\cite=FHT]).

In [\cite=Ha], Haefliger gives a process to construct a minimal model for (X,Y). With the hypotheses (H) of the Introduction, suppose that [formula] is the Sullivan minimal model of X. Denote by [formula] a supplement of the subvector space generated by the cocycles. Then [formula] is an acyclic differential graded ideal, and the quotient [formula] is a finite dimensional model for X. We denote by (B,d) the dual coalgebra. Let (ai), [formula] be a graded basis for A with a0 = 1 and denote by [formula] the dual basis for B.

Denote also by [formula] the minimal model of Y. We define a morphism of graded algebras

[formula]

by putting [formula]. In [\cite=Ha] Haefliger proves that there is a unique differential D on [formula] making

[formula]

a morphism of differential graded algebras. Then [formula] is a model for (X,Y) and φ is a model for the evaluation map (X,Y)  ×  X  →  Y. In particular, ([\cite=Vi]), the rational homotopy groups of (X,Y) are given by

[formula]

This formula is natural in X and Y.

Proof of Theorem 1.

In [\cite=Th] Thom computes the rational homotopy type of [formula] when dim  X < r. He proves that the mapping space is a product of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces,

[formula]

Since odd dimensional spheres are rationally Eilenberg-MacLane spaces, it follows that if Y has the rational homotopy type of a product of odd dimensional spheres, then (X,Y) is formal.

Suppose now that (X,Y) is formal. Since any retract of a formal space is formal, Y is formal. By Theorem 2, the image of the Hurewicz map for (X,Y) is finite dimensional. Recall that for a formal space, the cohomology is generated by classes that evaluate non trivially on the image of the Hurewicz map. Therefore the algebra [formula] is finitely generated.

The square of an even dimensional generator xi of [formula] gives a map [formula], ri  =  2|xi|. We denote by θ the product of those maps,

[formula]

We do not suppose that x2i  ≠  0. In fact if x2i  =  0 for all i, then θ is homotopically trivial but this has no effect on our argument. The pullback along θ of the product of the principal fibrations [formula] is a fibration

[formula]

By construction the rational cohomology of E is finite dimensional, and so the rational category of E is also finite.

Now from the definition of the dimension of X, there is a cofibration [formula] such that [formula] is surjective. The restriction to X' induces a map (X,Y)  →  (X',Y) whose homotopy fiber is the injection

[formula]

From the naturality of the formula for the rational homotopy groups of a mapping space, we deduce that [formula] is injective. Denote now E' the pullback of E  →  (X,Y) along j,

[formula]

Since [formula] is injective, it follows from the mapping theorem [\cite=FHT] that the rational category of E' is finite. In particular the cup length of E' is finite.

Now the rational cohomology of ΩnY is the free commutative graded algebra on the graded vector space S*, with [formula]. Therefore if Y is hyperbolic, [formula] will contain a free commutative graded algebra on an infinite number of generators, and in particular its cup length is infinite. It follows that Y is elliptic. To end the proof we only apply Yamaguchi result ([\cite=Ya]) that asserts that when Y is elliptic, and (X,Y) is formal, then Y has the rational homotopy type of a finite product of odd dimensional spheres.

Proof of Theorem 2

Denote by [formula] the bigraded model for Y and by (A,d) a connected finite dimensional model for X. Connected means that [formula]. Denote as above by ai, an homogeneous basis of A, and by [formula] the dual basis for [formula]. We write also [formula].

Recall now that a model for the evaluation map X  ×  (X,Y)  →  Y is given by the morphism

[formula]

defined by [formula].

We consider the differential ideal [formula], and we denote by [formula] the quotient map. In [formula] the equation [formula] gives for each v∈V the equation

[formula]

where θi is the derivation of [formula] defined by [formula] and [formula].

To go further we specialize the basis of A+. We denote by {yi} a basis of d(A), by {ej} a set of cocycles such that {yi,ej} is a basis of the cocycles in A. Finally we choose elements xi with d(xi) = yi. A basis of A is then given by 1 and the elements xi,yi and ej. Denote then by ψj, ψ'i and ψ''i the derivations θ associated respectively to ej, xi and yi. Then we have

[formula]

[formula]

it follows that the complex [formula] decomposes into a direct sum

[formula]

and where D is the ideal generated by the [formula] and [formula].

Consider now in [formula] a cocycle α of the form

[formula]

where ω is a decomposable element. Looking at the linear term of D(α) we obtain that [formula]. We can replace α by [formula] to cancel the linear part [formula]. We can thus suppose that α has the form

[formula]

where ω is a decomposable element.

In [formula], α decomposes into a sum of cocycles, [formula] with αi∈Ci. Let fix some i. We write r  =  |ei| and [formula]. We denote [formula]. Then the component Ci is isomorphic to [formula] and [formula] is equipped with an isomorphism of degree - r,

[formula]

We extend s in a derivation of [formula] by [formula], and the differential [formula] satisfies [formula].

Write [formula], where [formula]. We show that in that case v is a cocycle. If this is true for any i, this implies that the map

[formula]

is zero in degrees q  ≥   dim  Y. Since ρq is the dual of the Hurewicz map [formula], this implies the result.

We now follow the lines of the proof given for r = 1 by Dupont and Vigué-Poirrier in [\cite=DV]. Write [formula], and denote by (xi)i∈I a graded basis of [formula]. We denote by [formula] the derivation of degree -  |xi| defined by

[formula]

If v∈Vqp, we denote [formula]. This is a new gradation, and for any element P of [formula], we have

[formula]

The lower gradation on V extends to [formula]. If v∈Vqp, then [formula]. The differential [formula] is compatible with this double gradation,

[formula]

Write [formula], [formula] and [formula] with xi∈V, [formula]. Then

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

This implies that

[formula]

is a cocycle. In particular, v∈V0 and is a cocycle. This ends the proof of theorem 2.
