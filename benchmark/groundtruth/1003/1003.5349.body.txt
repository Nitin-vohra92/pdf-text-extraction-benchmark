On the optimality of Orthogonal Greedy Algorithm for M-coherent dictionaries. Eugene Livshitz

Introduction.

In this article we continue the research of convergence of greedy algorithms with regards to dictionaries with small coherence (see [\cite=GMS], [\cite=GN], [\cite=Tr], [\cite=DET], [\cite=DET1], [\cite=TZh], [\cite=L]). The study of approximation by incoherent dictionaries was mainly motivated by applications to compressed sensing. In [\cite=GMS], [\cite=Tr], [\cite=DET] it was shown that Orthogonal Greedy Algorithm (Orthogonal Matching Pursuit) is effective for signal recovering. In this article we discuss this problem from the point of view of Approximation Theory.

Let us recall standard definition of Greedy Algorithms theory. We say that a set D from a Hilbert space H is a dictionary if We study dictionaries with small values of coherence

[formula]

Dictionaries with coherence M are called M-coherent.

Orthogonal Greedy Algorithm (OGA) Set f0: = f∈H, GOGA0(f,D): = 0. For each m  ≥  0 we inductively find gm + 1∈D such that and define

For a function f∈H we define its best m-term approximation

Following V.N. Temlyakov we call inequalities connecting the error of Greedy approximation and the best m-term approximation Lebesgue type inequalities.

The first Lebesgue type inequality for Greedy Algorithms was obtained by A.C. Gilbert, M. Muthukrishnan and J. Strauss in [\cite=GMS]

Theorem A. For every M-coherent dictionary D and any function f∈H the inequality holds for all m,

This estimate was improved by J. Tropp [\cite=Tr] (see also paper [\cite=DET] of D. L. Donoho, M. Elad and V.N. Temlyakov.)

Theorem B. For every M-coherent dictionary D and any function f∈H

D. L. Donoho, M. Elad and V.N. Temlyakov [\cite=DET1] dramatically improved factor in front of σ.

Theorem C. For every M-coherent dictionary D and any function f∈H

V.N. Temlyakov and P. Zheltov [\cite=TZh] improved the upper border for m and proved two new Lebesgue type inequalities.

Theorem D. For every M-coherent dictionary D and any function f∈H

Theorem E. For every M-coherent dictionary D, any function f∈H and any fixed δ > 0

The aim of this article is to prove the following result.

Preliminary lemmas.

By conditions of Theorem [\ref=Th-cohOGA] we have

[formula]

We use several standard lemmas.

Using ([\ref=cohM]) we have for any 1  ≤  i  ≤  n

[formula]

Similarly The last two inequalities imply ([\ref=InnLeCoef]) and ([\ref=InnGeCoef]). It follow form ([\ref=MmM]) that To prove ([\ref=CoefLeInn]) we estimate

As corollary we obtain

Set It's clear that Thus the lemma follows from inequality ([\ref=CoefLeInn]) for h'.

For n  ≥  1 we define

[formula]

Let numbers xi,n, n  ≥  1, 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, satisfy the equality

[formula]

By definition of OGA

[formula]

and Hence

[formula]

Using ([\ref=cohM]) and ([\ref=inner-zero]) we have for h: = fn - 1  -  dngn and 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1 Suppose that x'i,n, 1  ≤  i  ≤  n satisfy By Lemma [\ref=Lm-max1]

[formula]

It follows from ([\ref=fnrepr]) that where xi,n  =  x'i,n, 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1 and xn,n  =  dn + x'n,n. This and ([\ref=xprinj]) complete the proof.

By definition of OGA Using Lemma [\ref=Lm-xin], ([\ref=cohM]) and ([\ref=MmM]) we have

[formula]

Using Lemma [\ref=Lm-dnp1] we write

Notations.

By the definition of the best m-term approximation there exist [formula], ψj∈D, 1  ≤  j  ≤  m, and v0∈H such that

[formula]

[formula]

Set Let numbers aj,n and bj,n, 0  ≤  n  ≤  2m, 1  ≤  j  ≤  m satisfy equalities

[formula]

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Define

[formula]

[formula]

For numbers xi,n, 1  ≤  i  ≤  n  ≤  2m, from ([\ref=numbxin-def]) and for dn from ([\ref=dn-def]) we define

Main lemmas.

Let Since n∈T2 and we get by Lemma [\ref=Lm-max1] that Therefore we have

[formula]

Let If [formula] then xn = 0, vn = vn - 1 = v0 and nothing to prove, so we may assume that un  ≥  1. By Lemma [\ref=Lm-dln]

[formula]

On the other hand we have Combining with ([\ref=dn-ineq1]) we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=Lm-xin], ([\ref=MmM]) and ([\ref=dnun]) we write

[formula]

We have that for any l, 1  ≤  l  ≤  m we have

Then by Lemma [\ref=Lm-max] we get

[formula]

Define

[formula]

According the definition of vn we have

[formula]

By definition of OGA 〈fn - 1,gi〉  =  0, 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1, therefore using ([\ref=defH]) and ([\ref=fnai])

[formula]

Applying ([\ref=cohM]), ([\ref=dnun1]), ([\ref=ainm1]) and Lemma [\ref=Lm-xin] we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

From ([\ref=vnsqest]) and ([\ref=MmM]) it follows that

[formula]

This estimate together with ([\ref=x_n-desineq]) proves the lemma.

Applying Lemma [\ref=Lm-xin] we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=Lm-max] we have

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

Set Using Lemma [\ref=Lm-xin], ([\ref=MmM]) and ([\ref=vnm1gn]) we estimate

[formula]

[formula]

Similar to the proof of Lemma [\ref=Lm-main1] we define Equalities 〈fn - 1,gi〉  =  0, 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1 imply that Using ([\ref=fnai]) we have

[formula]

Applying ([\ref=cohM]), ([\ref=ajnm2]), Lemma [\ref=Lm-xin] and Lemma [\ref=Lm-proj] we continue

[formula]

[formula]

Using definitions of vn' and h we write

[formula]

Applying ([\ref=vprsqnorm]), ([\ref=vprnh]) and ([\ref=hsqnorm]) we obtain

[formula]

Using Cauchy inequality, Lemma [\ref=Lm-main2] and Lemma [\ref=Lm-main1] we get

[formula]

[formula]

Applying ([\ref=v0sm]), Lemma [\ref=Lm-main1] and Lemma [\ref=Lm-main2] we write

[formula]

Hence

In the next lemma we use definitions ([\ref=bin-def]), ([\ref=S1-def]) and ([\ref=S2-def]).

By definition ([\ref=numbxin-def])

[formula]

Assume that numbers j,n and [formula], 1  ≤  j  ≤  m, 1  ≤  n  ≤  2m satisfy It follows from ([\ref=bin-def]) that

[formula]

It's clear that and therefore

[formula]

Set By Lemma [\ref=Lm-main3] we estimate for each j, 1  ≤  j  ≤  m,

[formula]

According Lemma [\ref=Lm-max1] we have for 1  ≤  j  ≤  m and 1  ≤  n  ≤  2m

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=MmM]), ([\ref=bjn-eq]), ([\ref=whbjn]) and ([\ref=wtbjn]) we obtain

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Th-cohOGA].

First we estimate |aj,2m|, j∈S2. For each 1  ≤  n  ≤  2m by Lemma [\ref=Lm-max] and Lemma [\ref=Lm-main5] we have

[formula]

Since [formula] and [formula] we get Hence Then by ([\ref=ainbin]) and Lemma [\ref=Lm-main5] for any j∈S2 we obtain We use well known inequality (see, for example, Lemma 2.1 from [\cite=DET1]) Using the definition of OGA, ([\ref=fnai]), Lemma [\ref=Lm-main4] and ([\ref=v0sm]) we estimate

[formula]

This completes the proof. [formula]
