A New Family of Models for Spherical Stellar Systems

Introduction

In this study we suggest a new family of spherical mass distribution models that generalizes models by An & Evans (2006, hereafter AE) and models by Kuzmin et al. [\citep=KV72] [\citep=KM69]. The family depends on two structural parameters. It includes Plummer's spheres [\citep=pl11], Hénon's isochrones [\citep=Henon59] and the model by Hernquist [\citep=lars90] as special cases.

The potential-density pair

Let us consider the dimensionless potential

[formula]

Here α  >  1 and p  >  0 are structural parameters. If α  =  2, 0  <  p  <  2 we obtain a model by AE, for α  >  0, p  =  2 we have a model by Kuzmin et al. (1969, 1972).

Poisson's equation yields the following expression for density

[formula]

It follows from ([\ref=rho]) that our models with 0 < p < 2 are cusped (as models by AE are). The density profiles for different values of parameters are shown in Figures [\ref=raspopova-fig1], [\ref=raspopova-fig2].

The circular speed is found to be

[formula]

Hydrostatics

A run of velocity dispersion σ2r can be found from an equation of hydrostatic equilibrium

[formula]

The results of calculations for an isotropic velocity distribution (β = 0) are shown in Figure [\ref=raspopova-fig3]. Central minima will appear in all models with density cusp. It can be obtained from ([\ref=phi]) that

[formula]

Then it is possible to find an augmented density ϱ(Φ) and calculate an isotropic distribution function.

Stability of such models can be studied using the third Antonov law [\citep=BTr], namely, if [formula] the model is stable against spherical perturbation. The validity of this inequality can be established after some laborious calculations.

Axisymmetric generalizations

Using the equipotential method by [\citet=saklpo81] one can construct axisymmetric generalizations of the suggested model. We considered a potential of such models

[formula]

where [formula] is the same function as [\eqref=phi] and f(R,z)  =   is an equation of equipotential surfaces, R, z being cylindrical coordinates. We considered the equipotentials by [\citet=mmn75]:

[formula]

and by [\citet=satoh80]:

[formula]

Here ε∈[0,1] is a new structure parameter. For spherical systems ε = 1.

We found that for ε close to 1 the density is positive for R, z everywhere. So we concluded that such non-spherical model can be used for approximating mass distribution in non-spherical star clusters and non-highly flattened galaxies.
