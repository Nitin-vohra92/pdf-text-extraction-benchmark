Basic and standard definition of a binary quasigroup is the following

Binary groupoid [formula] is called a quasigroup if for all ordered pairs (a,b)∈Q2 there exist unique solutions x,y∈Q to the equations [formula] and [formula] [\cite=VD].

T. Evans has given equational definition of a quasigroup [\cite=EVANS] (see Definition [\ref=def3]). Evans' definition usually used by the study of universal algebraic questions of quasigroup theory. The equivalence of Definitions [\ref=MAIN_QUAS_DEF] and [\ref=def3] is well known fact [\cite=VD] [\cite=SCERB_03].

In this paper we give some new equational definitions of quasigroups. The subject of this paper is close with the subject of articles [\cite=SCERB_07] [\cite=SCERB_TAB_PUSH_09].

We shall use basic terms and concepts from books [\cite=VD] [\cite=1a] [\cite=HOP].

Results of this paper are connected with the following

Research properties of algebra [formula] with various combinations of identities ([\ref=A])-([\ref=R]) ([\cite=SCERB_03], page 11).

It is well known the following

In algebra [formula] with identities ([\ref=A]), ([\ref=C]), ([\ref=B]), and ([\ref=D]) identities ([\ref=T]) and ([\ref=R]) are true [\cite=JDH_2007] [\cite=SCERB_03] [\cite=SCERB_07].

We can re-write identity ([\ref=D]) in the following form

[formula]

By identity ([\ref=A]) [formula]. Thus from identity ([\ref=four]) we obtain [formula], i.e. we obtain identity ([\ref=T]).

We can re-write identity ([\ref=B]) in the following form

[formula]

By identity ([\ref=C]) [formula]. Thus from identity ([\ref=twor]) we obtain [formula], i.e. we obtain identity ([\ref=R]).

Therefore it is used the following T. Evans' equational definition of a quasigroup [\cite=EVANS].

Information on properties of algebras with 3-element sets of identities that are taken from identities ([\ref=A])-([\ref=D]) it is possible to deduce from results of the articles [\cite=SCERB_07] [\cite=SCERB_TAB_PUSH_09]. For example, algebra [formula] with identities ([\ref=A]), ([\ref=C]), ([\ref=B]) is a left quasigroup with right division.

Let [formula] for all [formula], where [formula] is the ring of integers, [formula] if x = 2  ·  a; [formula], if x = 2  ·  a  +  1. It is possible to check that [formula] is a left quasigroup with right division.
