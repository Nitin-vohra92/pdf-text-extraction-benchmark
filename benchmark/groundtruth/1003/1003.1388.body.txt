An elementary semi-ampleness result for log canonical divisors

Shigetaka FUKUDA

In this note, every algebraic variety is defined over the field [formula] of complex numbers. We follow the terminology and notation in [\cite=Utah].

Divisors that are numerically equivalent to semi-ample [formula]-divisors are nef. So Main Theorem is a corollary of the famous log abundance conjecture for Kawamata log terminal pairs.

After the earlier draft of the manuscript was written out, Campana-Koziarz-Paun ([\cite=CKP]) showed that Main Theorem holds under the weaker condition that KX  +  Δ is numerically equivalent to some nef and abundant [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor.

For proof we cite the following two results. The first is the [formula]-linear triviality (Proposition [\ref=Prop:KaN]) due to Kawamata and Nakayama and the second is the relative semi-ampleness (Proposition [\ref=Prop:KNF]) due to Kawamata, Nakayama and Fujino.

Ambro ([\cite=Am] Theorem 0.1) gives an alternative proof to Proposition [\ref=Prop:KaN], by providing some log canonical bundle formula and applying it to the Albanese morphism.

In the statement of Main Theorem, Proposition [\ref=Prop:KaN] gives the special case where KX  +  Δ is numerically equivalent to the trivial divisor 0, which is, of course, semi-ample.

Let D be a semi-ample [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor that is numerically equivalent to KX  +  Δ. We consider the surjective morphism f:X  →  Y of normal projective varieties with only connected fibers, defined by the linear space H0(X,OX(lD)) for a sufficiently large and divisible integer l. Then lD  =  f*A for some ample divisor A on Y.

The log canonical divisor KX  +  Δ is f-nef. Furthermore the pair (F,Δ|F) is Kawamata log terminal and, from a Kawamata-Nakayama result (Proposition [\ref=Prop:KaN]), the log canonical divisor KF  +  (Δ|F)  =  (KX  +  Δ)|F is [formula]-linearly trivial for a general fiber F of f.

Thus a relative semi-ampleness result due to Kawamata-Nakayama-Fujino (Proposition [\ref=Prop:KNF]) gives the surjective morphism g:X  →  Z of normal projective varieties with only connected fibers, defined by the sheaf f*OX(m(KX  +  Δ)) for a sufficiently large and divisible integer m, with the structure morphism h:Z  →  Y such that hg = f. Then m(KX  +  Δ)  =  g*B for some h-ample divisor B on Z.

For a curve C on X, if f(C) is a point then also g(C) is a point, because 0  =  m(f*A,C)  =  m(l(KX  +  Δ),C)  =  l(m(KX  +  Δ),C)  =  l(g*B,C). Thus the morphism h is birational and finite. This means that h is the identity morphism by virtue of Zariski's Main Theorem.

Hence the divisors mA and lB are numerically equivalent to each other on Y, because f*(mA - lB) is numerically trivial on X. Thus lB is ample, from the fact that mA is ample. Consequently KX  +  Δ is semi-ample.

Finally, by relaxing the condition concerning singularities, we propose the following subconjecture towards the famous log abundance conjecture.

Kawamata's result ([\cite=Ka3]) proves Conjecture [\ref=Conj:LC] in the case where Δ is a reduced simple normal crossing divisor on a smooth variety X and where KX  +  Δ is numerically trivial.

Recently Gongyo ([\cite=Go]) proved Conjecture [\ref=Conj:LC] in dimension ≤  4. Moreover he extended Kawamata's result for the numerically trivial log canonical divisors KX  +  Δ to the case of projective semi-log canonical pairs (X,Δ). His proof depends on Proposition [\ref=Prop:KaN], the minimal model program ([\cite=BCHM]) with scaling and the theory of semi-log canonical pairs ([\cite=Fu00]) due to Fujino.
