Bs(Bd)  →  γν

Introduction

Rare decays of bottom quark [\cite=smrev] can be served as tests of the standard model (SM). As the observed process b  →  sγ which induced B  →  K*γ [\cite=bkstar] and B  →  Xsγ [\cite=bxs] at the hadronic level, b  →  sl+l-[\cite=bsll] are also studied extensively in the past both at inclusive and at exclusive levels. It was recognized that the SM prediction for the branching ratio of B  →  Xsν, which is ~  5  ×  10- 5[\cite=buras], is within one order beyond the present detectivity and this process might be observed soon[\cite=grossman]. Furthermore, the corresponding exclusive decay B  →  K*ν is important as an input to determine Vub to an accuracy of 10% [\cite=vub].

Pure leptonic decays of heavy pseudoscalar mesons into light lepton pairs are helicity suppressed, their branching ratios are [\cite=cam]:

[formula]

which make it difficult to determine fBs from these processes. For Bd the situation is even worse due to the small CKM mixing angles. Although the processes Bs(Bd)  →  τ+τ- do not suffer from this suppression mechanism and the branching ratio is about 10- 7 [\cite=buras] in SM, it is hard to be detected at future B-factory where the efficiency is not better than 10- 2. The processes Bs(Bd)  →  γν, whose branching ratios depend quadrically on fBs(fB), can be taken as a possible alternate to determine the decay constants. For detections of these processes the method of searching for the "missing mass" can be used, which is similar to the case of B  →  Xsν [\cite=grossman].

In the present work, we study the processes Bs(Bd)  →  γν within the SM. We will analyze Bs(Bd)  →  γν in the following: In section 2 the relevant effective Hamiltonian will be given in SM. Constituent quark model and pole model will be used in section 3 to give the predictions. Finally, section 4 contains some brief discussion.

Effective Hamiltonian

Let us start with the quark level process b  →  qν, with q = s or d. The Feynman diagrams are displayed in Fig.1. Both box and Z penguin diagrams contribute to this process. The resulting effective Hamiltonian is left handed in SM [\cite=lim] [\cite=buras]:

[formula]

with PL = (1 - γ5) / 2. The coefficient C is

[formula]

where x = m2t / m2W. For simplicity, we neglect the QCD correction to this coefficient, whose effects are within 2% if appropriate renormalization point is chosen [\cite=buras].

Since the neutrinos are massless in minimal SM, the processes Bq(b)  →  ν are forbidden by helicity. If an additional photon line is attached to any of the charged lines in Fig.1, the situation will be different: no helicity suppression exists any more. However, when the photon line is attached to one of the internal charged lines, there will be a suppression factor of m2b / m2W in the Wilson coefficient compared with the ones for b  →  qν. The reason is that these effective operators are now dimension-8 instead of dimension-6. On the other hand, the diagrams in Fig. 1 with photon line connected to one of the external (bottom or strange quark) lines, whose effective Hamiltonian turn out to be

[formula]

will be the dominant contributions to the decay Bq(b)  →  γν.

Model calculations

The effective Hamiltonian given in ([\ref=h4]) is not enough to analyze the processes Bq  →  γν. In addition, models are needed to do the calculations at the hadronic level. First we use a simple constituent quark model (see, for example [\cite=cheng]). In this model both of the (anti)quarks are treated non-relativistically with the same velocity of the hadron. Thus (anti)quarks masses are now constituent quark masses of the order of several hundred MeV. We use further the interpolating field technique[\cite=hqet] which relates all the hadronic matrix elements of the present case to the decay constants of the mesons. The amplitude for Bq  →  γν decay is:

[formula]

The first term inside the bracket comes from the CP-odd part of Bq, while the second term results from the CP-even part of Bq. Since mb >  > mq (q = d,s), we can safely neglect the term of 1 / mb. Then after squaring the amplitude, both CP-odd and CP-even parts give the same contribution to the decay rate. Performing the phase space integration over one of the two Dalitz variables, and summing over the three generation of neutrinos, we get the differential decay width versus the ν invariant mass:

[formula]

The decay width is:

[formula]

Using α = 1 / 132, ms = 0.51 GeV, mt = 176 GeV and |VtbV*ts| = 0.04, we get

[formula]

If the lifetime is taken as τ(Bs) = 1.34  ×  10- 12s [\cite=pdg], the branching ratio is found to be 1.9  ×  10- 8. The differential decay rate versus m2ν is displayed in Fig.2 (solid line).

For Bd meson decay, we take |VtbV*td| = 0.01 and md = 0.35 GeV. The decay width is then

[formula]

which corresponds to the branching ratio 2.6  ×  10- 9, if uses of τ(Bd) = 1.50  ×  10- 12s[\cite=pdg] and fBd = 0.2GeV are made.

We also apply the pole model to calculate the Bq meson decay. The main contribution here is the radiative transition of the Bq meson into an intermediate (virtual) B*q. The Feynman diagram is shown in Fig.3. The subsequent process B*q  →  ν is determined in SM by the effective Hamiltonian eqn.([\ref=h4]), while the BqB*qγ transition is taken as

[formula]

This corresponds to the first part of eqn.([\ref=5]), which is for the CP-odd part of Bq. Hereafter, we will concentrate only on the CP-odd combination of Bq and q. The effective coupling constant is usually explained as a function of the invariant mass of the intermediate B*q. Here we simply derive its value from the constituent quark model as a constant [\cite=cheng],

[formula]

The 1 / mb term can also be neglected compared to the 1 / mq term. Note that the potential model[\cite=potent] gives

[formula]

with

[formula]

which is quite close to ([\ref=gcoup]). Now the amplitude of the decay Bq  →  γν is:

[formula]

Here again we give the differential cross section for the purpose of being used experimentally:

[formula]

After integrating over the phase space, the decay width is obtained as

[formula]

where

[formula]

The formula ([\ref=13],[\ref=14]) are similar to the constituent quark model case eqn.([\ref=6],[\ref=7]). It is easy to see that if mB*q  =  mBq, fB*q = fBq are taken in eqn.([\ref=13],[\ref=14]), they will reduce exactly to eqn.([\ref=6],[\ref=7]).

Now we use mB*s = 5.42 GeV and get:

[formula]

It is only slightly different from eqn.([\ref=9]), because mB*s is not quite different from mBs. The branching ratio is 1.8  ×  10- 8, if fB*s = fBs = 0.2 GeV is used. The differential decay rate calculated in pole model is also displayed in Fig.2 (dashed line) as function of m2ν.

For Bd meson, we get

[formula]

The branching ratio is obtained as 2.4  ×  10- 9, also quite close to that obtained in constituent quark model.

Conclusion

We predict the branching ratios in SM for Bs  →  γν to be 10- 8 and for Bd  →  γν to be 10- 9. With these branching ratios, they are hopeful to be detected at future B factories or LHC. They can provide alternate channels for measuring fBs (fBd).
