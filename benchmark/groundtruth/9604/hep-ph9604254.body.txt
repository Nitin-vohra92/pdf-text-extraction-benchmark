Recently [\cite=hep] a new approach to implement recurrence relations [\cite=ch-tk] for vacuum integrals was suggested. Such relations connect Feynman integrals with various degrees of their denominators. In many cases they provide a possibility to express an integral with given degrees of denominators as a linear combination of a few master integrals with some coefficient functions. The common way to evaluate these functions is step-by-step recurrence procedure, which demands a lot of calculations. On the other hand, the construction of such procedure is a serious problem even at the three-loop level.

For vacuum three-loop integrals with one non-zero mass and various numbers of massless lines the corresponding algorithms were constructed in [\cite=REC].

In the approach proposed in [\cite=hep] these coefficient functions were calculated directly as solutions of the corresponding recurrence relations. In [\cite=hep] explicit formulas for the solutions of these relations for 3-loop case with arbitrary masses were obtained. As an example, the case of integrals with four equal masses and two massless lines was considered, and the efficiency of this approach was demonstrated by calculations of the 3-loop QED vacuum polarization.

In this work we show how to extend the general formulas for the solutions of the recurrence relations for the multi-loop case. Let us consider L-loop vacuum integrals with N = L(L + 1) / 2 denominators (this number of denominators provides the possibility to represent any scalar product of loop momenta as linear combination of the denominators; the diagrams of practical interest which usually have less number of denominators, can be considered as partial cases when some degrees are equal to zero):

[formula]

where [formula] and pi ([formula]) are loop momenta.

Let us derive recurrence relations that result from integration by parts, by letting (∂  /  ∂pi)  ·  pk act on the integrand [\cite=ch-tk]:

[formula]

where [formula], and (A- 1)akl come from the expansion of the pi  ·  pj terms appearing in the numerator through denominators Da:

[formula]

Using the relations

[formula]

the recurrence relations ([\ref=rr]) can be represented as

[formula]

The differential equation corresponding to ([\ref=rr1]) by substitutions [formula], [formula] has a solution g(xa) = P(xa  +  μa)(D - L - 1) / 2, where P(xa) is the polynomial in xa of degree L:

[formula]

.

Let us consider "Laurent" coefficients of the function g(xa):

[formula]

where integral symbols denote N subsequent complex integrations with contours which will be described below. Acting by ([\ref=rr1]) on ([\ref=solution]) one gets up to the surface terms the corresponding differential operator acting on g(xa), that is zero. Then, the surface terms can be removed if we choose closed or ended in infinity point contours (to provide the cancelation of the surface terms in the last case one can consider analytical continuations on D from large negative values). So ([\ref=solution]) is a solution of relations ([\ref=rr]), and different choices of contours correspond to different solutions, enumerated by the index k.

Then, according to dimensional regularization rules, integrals ([\ref=integral]) are equal to zero if the number of positive na is less then L. In the 3-loop case [\cite=hep] the coefficient functions can be constructed as linear combinations of those that are equal to zero if the index from definite three-index set ("Taylor" indexes) is not positive. One can obtain such solutions if one chooses contours, corresponding to these indexes, as circles around zero. In this case these three integrations can be performed and lead to coefficient in the common Taylor expansion in the corresponding variables. We hope that it will be applicable as well for the L-loop case and the number of integrations in ([\ref=solution]) can be reduced from L(L + 1) / 2 to L.

Finally note that solutions ([\ref=solution]) by construction satisfy D-shifted recurrence relations

[formula]

But if one want to construct the coefficient functions k(,D) for some specific set of master integrals, one gets linear combinations of fk(,D) with coefficients depending on D. This dependence leads to a nontrivial mixing matrix in the D-shifted recurrence relations

[formula]

So in this paper we construct explicit formulas ([\ref=solution]) for the solutions of the recurrence relations for multi-loop vacuum integrals with arbitrary masses. In forthcoming paper we plan to generalize these formulas for the non-vacuum case.
