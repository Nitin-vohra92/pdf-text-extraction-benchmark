In the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), we discuss the introduction of exotic matter below the string scale MX in order to achieve gauge unification at MX (a constraint of a large class of string models). The possible types of exotic matter that can realise this are investigated and its effect on the top quark mass mt is presented. The implementation of a theory of fermion masses which utilises the exotic matter is briefly discussed.

Gauge Unification

It has been known for a long time that a constraint of simple GUTs such as SU(5), SO(10) is that the gauge couplings should become equal when evolved up to a high energy scale. This scale is the energy at which the GUT breaks down into the Standard Model MGUT and this "unification" means that

[formula]

where α1,2,3 are the gauge couplings corresponding to the U(1)Y, SU(2)L and SU(3) simple gauge groups in the Standard Model (SM) respectively. Several authors have shown that Eq. [\ref=GUT] is not satisfied when the effective theory at energy scales between MGUT and MZ is the SM. The gauge couplings evolve because the gauge boson propagator has a divergent contribution coming from loops of particles with a mass less than the relevant energy scale. This means that if the particle content of a theory is changed, so is the evolution of the gauge couplings. When the SM is supersymmetrised to become the MSSM, the extra particles ("superpartners" and Higgs) alter the evolution in such a way that the values of αi(MZ) that are extracted from experiment and evolved to MGUT satisfy Eq. [\ref=GUT] to a good accuracy1). This point is illustrated by Fig. [\ref=fig:MSSM] in which the solid lines show the gauge couplings meeting at MGUT  ~  1016 GeV. Simple GUTs only have one gauge coupling, which then evolves at scales μ  >  MGUT as shown. While GUTs provide a simple and elegant scheme for helping to explain the origin of the strong and electroweak forces, they do not include any quantum description of gravity. The only known consistent theories of quantum gravity to date are superstring theories, and we now turn to these to examine how the above apparent success of gauge coupling unification in GUTs translates into string models.

String Gauge Boundary Conditions

In string models, the constraints on the low energy gauge couplings may be different to the ones in Eq. [\ref=GUT]. In fact, the relevant relations are2)

[formula]

where ki are the Kac-Moody levels associated with the string model. For our analysis, the important fact about ki is that they are numerical constants that are set, once the string model has been chosen. For non-abelian groups, the Kac-Moody levels must be natural numbers whereas they are rational for abelian groups3). This means that [formula], k1∈Z / Z. The only semi-realistic models (i.e. with 3 families etc.) that have been constructed to date have k2,3 = 1 and so we concentrate on this case.

At first sight it appears that one constraint is lost compared to the GUT case because we have imposed no conditions upon k1, the normalisation of Y. However, string models with k2,3 = 1 relate the scale of the breakdown of string theory to the gauge couplings through the relation

[formula]

This would mean that low energy phenomenology is incompatible with the prediction α2(MX) = α3(MX), since if the gauge couplings were evolved to MX in the MSSM, the solid lines in Fig. [\ref=fig:MSSM] would still cross at MGUT and be different at MX. There are, however several reasons4) why the measured gauge couplings might (wrongly) appear to be in conflict with Eq. [\ref=strings] and therefore with the class of string models that we are advocating. Several of these possible reasons have been discussed by other authors4), but we turn to one particular possibility that unambiguously satisfies Eq. [\ref=GUT].

Intermediate Matter

One can imagine a theory in which some matter additional to the MSSM3),4),5) has a mass MI where MZ  <  MI  <  MX. Below MI we have the MSSM, and above it the effect of the extra matter is felt upon the gauge couplings. In string models which break to the MSSM and have k2 = k3 = 1, the only possible matter fields present in the low energy theory are (3,1), (1,2) and (3,2) representations. Leaving hypercharge assignments aside, these fields look like extra copies of right handed quarks qR, left handed lepton doublets LL and left handed quarks QL respectively. We label the number of qR, LL and QL fields a,b,c respectively. One can solve α2(MX) = α3(MX) and Eq. [\ref=scale] to obtain MI,MX,αstring for each choice of possible intermediate matter. In Fig. [\ref=fig:MSSM], the dotted lines show how the intermediate matter can "re-focus" the gauge couplings to meet at the string scale MX. The bound MI  <  MX implies that

[formula]

for the model to unify α2(MX) = α3(MX).

Top Quark Mass

When one evolves the top quark Yukawa coupling ht from high to low energy scales in the MSSM, one finds that the RGEs naturally "focus" the couplings into a narrow range at low energy centred around the infra red stable fixed point (IRSFP)6). This IRSFP of ht in the MSSM corresponds to mt  /   sin β  ≈  174 - 195 GeV. The "quasi fixed point" (QFP) is defined when ht at some high energy scale (say MX) is large, and in this case the low energy value of the top mass mt  /   sin β  ~  210 GeV is independent of what the actual value of ht(MX) is. The IRSFP of the top quark Yukawa coupling is described analytically by

[formula]

where b3 is the QCD beta function. In the region of energy scales between MI and MX, we have added coloured matter which changes b3 and could possibly change the low energy prediction of the top quark mass. Overall, the effect of the intermediate matter is to drive ht nearer to its QFP value that corresponds to mt  /   sin β  ≈  210 GeV.

Lighter Fermion Masses

We now address the question of how the pattern and hierarchy of the fermion masses and mixing angles may arise. In our models, the only renormalisable fermion mass term is the one in the 33 element of the mass matrices, with all the others initially being zero. We now consider how the lighter fermions could acquire mass and mixing angles. One idea7) is to extend the gauge symmetry of the MSSM by a family dependent abelian U(1)X. The theory contains SM singlets θ1,- 1 which acquire VEVs, and these break the U(1)X symmetry. We introduce some heavy Higgs doublets of mass M with different X charges and these help to generate non-renormalisable operators which play the role of mass and mixing terms. The other entries in the matrix appear once θ acquires a VEV 〈θ〉. The nonrenormalisable operators produced in this way can generate a predictive and explanatory scheme of masses and mixings angles7),8).

However, we have already been using the candidate heavy Higgs to help unify αi in string scenarios so we may be able to put these to work to give a predictive theory of fermion masses. In this framework, the U(1)X has mixed anomalies with SU(3), SU(2)L, U(1)Y and to cancel these using a (string-type) mechanism called GSW, the Kac-Moody levels must be in the ratio

[formula]

The GSW mechanism also requires 〈θ〉  /  MX   ~  O(1 / 40) but for a correct fermion mass hierarchy we require 〈θ〉  /  MI   ~  0.2. Thus there is an extra constraint on the models that

[formula]

We may now search through the models to see if any can make the gauge couplings unify at MX and give an explanatory and predictive theory of fermion masses. This may be achieved by checking that Eq.s [\ref=henry],[\ref=strings],[\ref=Ks] are satisfied and that the extra matter is in a form to give the correct pattern of light fermion masses.

Summary

Intermediate matter is an effective way of obtaining gauge unification at the string scale. Its mass may come from hidden sector dynamics or non-renormalisable string-type operators9). The intermediate matter can be combined with an abelian family dependent gauge symmetry to yield the lighter fermion masses. It is now possible to construct10) explicit models which incorporate both a predictive and explanatory theory of fermion masses and which unify the gauge couplings at the string scale. In this manner, we may develop a realistic theory coming from a superstring model.
