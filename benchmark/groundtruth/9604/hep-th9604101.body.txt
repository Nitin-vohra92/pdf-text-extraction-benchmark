Abstract We show how the method of separation of variables can be used to construct integrable models corresponding to curves describing vacuum structure of four-dimensional N  =  2 SUSY Yang-Mills theories. We use this technique to construct models corresponding to SU(N) Yang-Mills theory with Nf < 2N matter hypermultiplets by generalising the periodic Toda lattice. We also show that some special cases of massive SU(3) gauge theory can be equivalently described by the generalisations of the Goryachev-Chaplygin top obtained via separation of variables.

1. In [\cite=SeiWit:mon], Seiberg and Witten described an intimate relationship between hyperelliptic curves and exact effective actions for N  =  2 SU(2) gauge theories in four dimensions. Their results were soon generalised to SU(N) gauge theories [\cite=KleLer:...] and the corresponding curves were found [\cite=HanOz:mod]. For the SU(N) gauge theory coupled to Nf < 2N matter hypermultiplets the curves are given by

[formula]

Here ui, [formula] are gauge-invariant order parameters, mi, [formula] are masses of the particles and ΛNf are dynamically generated scales (ΛNf  =  Λ for any Nf  ≥  N). Furthermore for any integer l, 0  ≤  l  ≤  Nf, [formula] are symmetric polynomials in mi defined by

[formula]

Later it was realised that the Seiberg-Witten theory can be reformulated in terms of classical integrable Hamiltonian systems corresponding to the elliptic Whitham hierarchy [\cite=GorKri:int]. The hyperelliptic curves of N  =  2 supersymmetric gauge theories are then interpreted as the spectral curves of the Lax matrix L(u) of the corresponding integrable models. For example in [\cite=Mar:exa] the curve describing SU(3) theory with two massless particles was found to correspond to the Goryachev-Chaplygin top. In general the relevant systems turn out to be the specific limits of the Hitchin models [\cite=DonWit:sup] such as elliptic Calogero models [\cite=Mar:int] or SL(2)-spin chains [\cite=GorMar:not]. In the present paper we suggest the use of separation of variables to explicitly construct the required integrable systems. In particular we identify the curves describing N  =  2 SUSY QCD with three colours and even number of flavours Nf and pairwise coinciding masses, with separated equations of motion of generalisations of the Goryachev-Chaplygin top constructed recently in [\cite=Sco:sep] via separation of variables. We also propose a generalisation of the periodic Toda lattice whose separated equations of motion describe the vacuum structure of the four-dimensional N = 2 SUSY SU(N) Yang-Mills theory coupled to Nf < 2N massive matter hypermultiplets.

2. We begin by showing how separation of variables can provide a constructive procedure of building integrable models corresponding to complex curves that describe the vacuum structure of N  =  2 supersymmetric gauge theories. Assume that we have a classical Hamiltonian system integrable in the Liouville-Arnold sense with n degrees of freedom. Let Hi, i = 1,...,n, be its first integrals in involution. Then, at least locally, there exist canonical variables (pi,qi) which allow for separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation thus leading to a system of n-equations [formula]. Each such equation describes a curve in variables (pi,qi). In most cases the functions Φi coincide, i.e. Φi  =  Φ, [formula], and thus the separated equations describe identical curves. The problem of solving the system reduces to solving the equation [formula]. Having solved the integrable system by separation of variables one can construct new integrable systems by adding new terms to Φ. One starts with the separation coordinates (pi,qi), and considers a system described by separated equations [formula], where Ψ is an arbitrary function which does not depend on [formula]. One then writes [formula] in terms of original dynamical variables in which the system was defined in the first place and thus obtains a new integrable system which generalises the one one has started with. In this way one can obtain a hierarchy or a family of integrable models which separate in the same coordinates. Although the function Ψ may be arbitrary it is not always easy to find functions that lead to physically interesting models. This method of constructing new integrable models via separation of variables was considered in [\cite=Mac:int] in the case of Neumann model and is fully developed in [\cite=Sco:sep].

From the point of view of N  =  2 supersymmetric gauge theories, one views pi,qi (or some functions of pi and qi) as complex variables, and the equation [formula] as a definition of a complex curve. One can then adjust function Ψ in such a way that the resulting curve corresponds to a given gauge field theory and then, by converting to original variables, one can find corresponding integrable dynamical system. For example, as will be shown in next two sections, knowing the curve and the model corresponding to the pure gauge theory, one can construct a model corresponding to the gauge theory coupled to matter.

Let us note that the above interpretation of hyperelliptic curves of N  =  2 SUSY gauge theories in terms of separated Hamilton-Jacobi equations agrees with that of [\cite=GorKri:int] in which the curves are identified with spectral curves of the Lax operator L(u). In the modern approach to separation of variables [\cite=Skl:sep] via functional Bethe Ansatz one starts with the eigenvalue problem of the Lax operator, L(u)Ω(u)  =  p(u)Ω(u). For many models, the poles qi of the Baker-Akhiezer function Ω(u) Poisson commute with each other and together with the corresponding eigenvalues pi  =  p(qi) (or some functions of pi) provide the set of separation variables. It is clear that since for each i, pi is an eigenvalue of L(qi), (pi,qi) lie on the spectral curve of the Lax operator, i.e. [formula]. This last equation gives the separated equations of motion since the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of L(qi) depend only on the Hamiltonians [formula]. Thus the spectral curve of L(u) plays the role of a generating function of separated Hamilton-Jacobi equations.

3. As a first illustration of the general procedure of interpreting hyperelliptic curves in terms of separated Hamilton-Jacobi equations of integrable models we consider the SU(3) curves ([\ref=nf>nc]) with Nf = 2n, n = 0,1,2, and mi + n  =  mi, [formula], and we show that the corresponding integrable system is a generalisation of the Goryachev-Chaplygin top.

The Goryachev-Chaplygin top is constructed from the variables xi, Ji, i = 1,2,3 whose Poisson brackets obey the following relations

[formula]

The Hamiltonian of the system is

[formula]

where b is a free parameter. If the motion of the model is subjected to the constraints

[formula]

then the induced Poison bracket is non-degenerate and there is an additional integral of motion

[formula]

thus making the system completely integrable. The Goryachev-Chaplygin top admits the separation coordinates

[formula]

with the conjugate momenta p1,p2 given by cos (2pi)  =   - x1 + x3J1 / qi. The separated equations are

[formula]

where H and G are now interpreted as separation constants. The left hand side of ([\ref=separated.chap]) may be interpreted as new first integrals Hi. Thus equivalently we can define the Goryachev-Chaplygin top by giving the H1, H2 as stated.

To recover curves ([\ref=nf>nc]) we follow the procedure described above and consider the generalisation of the Goryachev-Chaplygin top given by the separated equations [\cite=Sco:sep]

[formula]

where i = 1,2. For given n, the generalisation of the Goryachev-Chaplygin top ([\ref=separated.gen]) depends on n mass parameters [formula] and the scale An. The polynomials t(2n)k are given by ([\ref=tk.eq]) with mn + i  =  mi, [formula]. We recover the original Goryachev-Chaplygin top when n = 1, m1 = 0 and A1  =  2b. By setting x = qi and

[formula]

we obtain that the equations ([\ref=separated.gen]) describe the curves

[formula]

which for n = 0,1,2 are equivalent to ([\ref=nf>nc]) provided we make the identifications:

[formula]

We can express H and G in ([\ref=separated.gen]) in terms of the natural coordinates Ji,xi and consider H as a physical Hamiltonian of this new integrable system. Following [\cite=Sco:sep] we define functions

[formula]

for any integer r. In terms of the original variables Ji the functions J(r) read

[formula]

for any non-negative integer m. Using these functions we can write Hamiltonian H of the system described by separated equations ([\ref=separated.gen]) as

[formula]

The other constant of motion is

[formula]

For given n, the Hamiltonian H and the other integral G have the following structure

[formula]

[formula]

where Pn, Qn are polynomials of degree at most n. Explicitly for all the cases relevant to the N  =  2 supersymmetric SU(3) gauge theory the polynomials Pn, Qn read

[formula]

[formula]

4. Now we proceed to construct models corresponding to curves that describe the vacuum structure of massive SU(N) theories with arbitrary Nf < 2N, as given by ([\ref=nf>nc]). It is known that for Nf = 0 the corresponding model is the periodic Toda lattice. Therefore we seek suitable generalisations of the Toda lattice whose separated equations of motion could lead to all the curves given by ([\ref=nf>nc]).

Recall that the periodic Toda lattice is given by the Hamiltonian

[formula]

where (πi,xi), [formula] are canonical variables and xN + 1  =  x1. Without the loss of generality we can assume that the total momentum [formula], which is a constant of motion, vanishes. In [\cite=KacMoe:som] the separation coordinates [formula] for the Toda lattice were constructed as eigenvalues of the matrix L1 obtained from the N  ×  N Lax-matrix

[formula]

by deleting first row and column. The separated equations are

[formula]

[formula]. Here [formula] are constants of motion and pi are momenta conjugate to qi given by pi  =   log |ex1 - x2 det (qi - L2)|, where L2 is the matrix obtained from L by deleting first two rows and columns. We remark in passing that equations ([\ref=toda.separated]) are equivalent to the equation det (v - L(u)) = 0 for the spectral parameter dependent N  ×  N Lax matrix L(u) (see e.g. [\cite=GorMar:not]) provided we put v  =  qi, u = epi.

Following the general procedure described in Section 2 we consider an integrable system constructed from the canonical variables pi,qi, [formula] defined above and the separated equations

[formula]

[formula]. Here Pn1, Qn2 are polynomials such that [formula], and [formula] are first integrals of motion (or, equivalently, separation constants).

The corresponding hyperelliptic curve is obtained by setting

[formula]

and is identical with ([\ref=nf>nc]).

Therefore any classical integrable Hamiltonian system given by separated equations ([\ref=gen.gen]) provides a generalisation of the Toda lattice which describes a vacuum structure of general N = 2 SUSY QCD. Now we would like to study the structure of this model from the Hamiltonian point of view. In particular we would like to express the model in terms of the natural variables πi,xi. Following ([\ref=toda.separated]) we choose uN - 2  =  H to be the Hamiltonian of the system. Using properties of the Vandermonde determinant one easily finds the explicit form of the Hamiltonian

[formula]

Although the explicit expressions for qi in terms of πi and xi cannot be obtained the expressions of the form

[formula]

where F is any rational function can be found in terms of original variables since they involve only symmetric polynomials [formula] in the eigenvalues [formula] of matrix L1. The polynomials [formula] can be easily read off from the characteristic polynomial of L1, e.g. [formula] and [formula] etc. This suffices to find H as a function of xi,πi since, by definition of the pi,

[formula]

is a rational function of qi. Furthermore, with no loss of generality we can assume that n1  ≥  n2 and take

[formula]

Then, the Hamiltonian H ([\ref=h.gen]) has the following form

[formula]

where G(N)Nf are polynomials in [formula] of degree n1 - 2. For a given N, G(N)Nf are defined for any [formula] and are obtained as contributions to H coming from the terms of the form

[formula]

As an explicit example we take n1,n2 such that n1 - n2 is either 0 or 1. The first seven G(N)Nf come out as:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

The G(N)Nf functions listed above suffice to describe all the Hamiltonians of integrable models corresponding to SU(3) and SU(4) gauge theories.

Notice that the generalised Goryachev-Chaplygin Hamiltonian derived in Section 3 can be viewed as a special case of the N = 3 Hamiltonian ([\ref=h.gen]) provided we make suitable identifications of qi,pi and Pn1, Qn2.

We would like to conclude the paper by indicating the possibility of yet another description of the curve ([\ref=nf>nc]) which makes explicit use of interpretation of y and x as functions on the phase space of the integrable Hamiltonian system given by ([\ref=gen.gen]). The Hamiltonians uk give rise to Hamiltonian vector fields parametrised by the 'times' [formula] and, for any function f on the phase space, given by [formula] Using definition ([\ref=gen.y]) of y and x and separated equations ([\ref=gen.gen]) we can express the curve ([\ref=nf>nc]) as

[formula]

We think that this simple equation can prove useful in analysis and interpretation of the canonical form on the hyperelliptic curve, which constitutes the second half of the Seiberg-Witten theory. The analysis of the canonical one-form from this point of view is currently being carried out and we hope to present the results of this investigation soon.
