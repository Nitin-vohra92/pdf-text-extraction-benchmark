The effective theory

The Calogero-Sutherland model describes a system of N non-relativistic spinless fermions of mass m moving on a circle of length L with a pairwise interaction proportional to the inverse square of the chord distance between the two particles  [\cite=cal] [\cite=sut]. Denoting by xi the coordinate of the i-th fermion along the circle and choosing units such that [formula], the hamiltonian reads

[formula]

where g is the coupling constant. In the following we shall take N odd, without any loss of generality.

This model is exactly solved by Bethe Ansatz and all its fundamental properties can be obtained from this solution [\cite=sut]. In particular, the low-energy excitations above the ground state are gapless, and thus the long-distance properties of the system are described by a conformal field theory [\cite=bpz] [\cite=hald1] [\cite=kaya].

The second quantized hamiltonian corresponding to h is the sum of the kinetic term

[formula]

and the interaction term [\cite=clz]

[formula]

where ψn are fermionic oscillators of momentum [formula], satisfying standard anticommutation relations.

The hamiltonian H0 describes a free fermionic system whose ground state is

[formula]

with nF  =  (N - 1) / 2 . Only the oscillators near the Fermi points ±  nF play an important role in physical processes, producing the low-energy excitations above |Ω〉 and determining the large-distance properties of the system encoded in the effective theory. In order to write down the corresponding hamiltonian, we define shifted fermionic operators associated to the small fluctuations around each Fermi point according to

[formula]

The quantity [formula] ([formula]) represents the momentum of the oscillator ar (br) relative to the right (left) Fermi point. The integer index r is allowed to vary only in a finite range between -  Λ0 and +  Λ0, where Λ0 is a bandwidth cut-off chosen such that Λ0  ≪  nF, and Λ0 = o(nF) = o(N) in the thermodynamic limit N  →    ∞  . Roughly speaking, Λ0 indicates how far from the Fermi points one can go without leaving the effective regime. The two sets of oscillators a and b in Eq. ([\ref=arbr]) define two independent and finite branches of excitations around each Fermi point, such that

[formula]

The kinetic part of the hamiltonian for these effective degrees of freedom reads

[formula]

Let us now consider the interaction hamiltonian HI. We seek the corresponding effective operator HI in terms of bilinear fermionic forms, which can be naturally interpreted within the algebraic context of extended conformal theories. To this end, a reordering of the oscillators in Eq. ([\ref=hics]) is needed. However, this causes the appearance of a divergent two-fermion term, and thus it is necessary to introduce a regularization prescription to give a meaning to our formulas. We perform a "periodic regularization", by dividing the momentum space into fictitious Brillouin zones of amplitude 2M, and identifying l and l' if l' = l + 2M  k for any integer k. The arbitrary number M has the only constraint M  ≫  nF, such that the physical region of interest is inside the first zone. Thus, we can calculate the effect of the small oscillations around the Fermi points ±  nF in the first Brillouin zone, and, at the end, let M  →    ∞   to recover the original continuum theory. It can be shown that this procedure is consistent and leads to finite and meaningful results [\cite=flsz]. With this regularization the effective hamiltonian HI(M) is

[formula]

where the forward scattering part Hforw(M) is

[formula]

with [formula] being the periodic extension modulo 2M of the absolute value, defined by [formula] for |κ|  ≤  M. The symbol [formula] means that the sum over [formula] is restricted to values satisfying the constraints:

[formula]

The backward scattering hamiltonian, Hback(M), is

[formula]

while the term H', arising from a reordering of the oscillators in Eq. ([\ref=hics]), is

[formula]

The effective theory is defined by letting Λ0  →    ∞  , N  →    ∞   and keeping Λ0  ≪  N. This avoids the introduction of spurious low-energy states (the O(1 / N2)-corrections bend the dispersion curve) [\cite=flsz]. For ease of notation, when Λ0 and N  →    ∞  , we write the free effective hamiltonian H0 simply as in Eq. ([\ref=kinab]) with all sums extended from -    ∞   to +    ∞  , and the limit N  →    ∞   left implicit. Even though H0 now contains new oscillators, it still acts only on low-energy states with particle and hole momenta bounded by Λ0  ≪  N. Nonetheless, the extension of the dispersion curve to infinity is not free of consequences. In fact, since now Eqs. ([\ref=abvac1]) hold for any integers r and s, the ground state |Ω〉 corresponds to the surface of two infinite Fermi seas.

Using the definition of nF, we easily see that Eq. ([\ref=kinab]) becomes

[formula]

where ρ0 = N / L is the density, which is kept fixed in the thermodynamic limit. Analogously, the forward scattering terms, Eq. ([\ref=hifcs]) (which are actually independent of the regularization parameter M), simply turn into

[formula]

The backward scattering terms, instead, explicitly depend on M. Rewriting Eq. ([\ref=hibcs]) in terms of fermion bilinears and removing the bandwidth cut-off leads to the appearance of a divergent two-body term, in addition to a finite four-fermion piece. However, after combining these terms with H'(M), the resulting hamiltonian in Eq. ([\ref=hidue]) is finite. In fact [\cite=flsz]

[formula]

We now summarize our results by writing the complete effective hamiltonian of the model, which is

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Notice that there are no contributions to H to order 1 / N3 and higher. Note also that, despite the overall factor 1 / L2 in Eq. ([\ref=hibcs]), the backward scattering part contributes to both the zeroth- and first-order effective hamiltonians H(0) and H(1), due to normal ordering effects. On the contrary, the forward scattering part, Eq. ([\ref=hif1cs]), contributes only to H(2).

The W1 +   ∞ structure of the model

We now show that the effective hamiltonian H in Eq. ([\ref=seriesc]) can be given an elegant algebraic interpretation. In fact, if we introduce the fermionic bilinear operators

[formula]

and [formula], [formula] and [formula] defined as above with [formula] replaced by [formula], then the operators H(k) of Eqs. ([\ref=hc0])-([\ref=hc2]) become respectively

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The reason for this rewriting lies in the fact that the operators in Eqs. ([\ref=fockw]) are the lowest generators of the infinite dimensional algebra known as W1 +   ∞  [\cite=shen] [\cite=kac1]. Its general form is

[formula]

where the structure constants [formula] and [formula] are polynomial in their arguments, c is the central charge, and the dots denote a finite number of terms involving the operators [formula]. In our case c = 1, and the relevant commutation relations are

[formula]

Eqs. ([\ref=walg0]) and ([\ref=walg1]) show respectively that the generators [formula] satisfy the Abelian Kac-Moody algebra [formula], and the generators [formula] satisfy the Virasoro algebra. The operators [formula] close the same algebra ([\ref=walg]) and commute with the [formula]'s.

The c = 1 W1 +   ∞ algebra can be also realized by bosonic operators, through a generalized Sugawara construction [\cite=kac1]. In fact, if one introduces the right and left moving modes, [formula] and [formula], of a free compactified boson, one can check that the commutation relations ([\ref=walg]) are satisfied by defining [formula] (we only write the expressions for i = 0,1,2) as

[formula]

and analogously the [formula] in terms of [formula].

The major advantage for choosing the basis of the [formula] operators is that, once the algebraic content of the theory has been established in the free fermionic picture, other bosonic realizations of the same algebra can be used, and the free value of the compactification radius of the boson can be chosen to diagonalize the total hamiltonian. This is the reason for calling this procedure algebraic bosonization [\cite=flsz].

In the fermionic description it is easy to see that the highest weight states of the [formula] algebra are obtained by adding ΔN particles to the ground state |Ω〉, and by moving ΔD particles from the left to the right Fermi point; they are denoted by |ΔN,ΔD〉0. The descendant states,

[formula]

with [formula], and [formula], coincide with the particle-hole excitations obtained from |ΔN,ΔD〉0. Using the expressions of V  00 and [formula] given in Eq. ([\ref=fockw]), one finds that the charges associated to these states are

[formula]

From these eigenvalues, we clearly see that the bosonic field built out of the [formula] and [formula] (see Eq. ([\ref=mod0])) is compactified on a circle of radius r0 = 1. This field describes the density fluctuations of the original free fermions.

Let us now consider the 1 / N-term of the effective hamiltonian in Eq. ([\ref=hcv1]). Due to the left-right mixing term proportional to g, H(1) is not diagonal on the states [formula]. However, it can be diagonalized [\cite=lutt] using the Sugawara construction: indeed, replacing [formula] with the expression given by Eq. ([\ref=mod1]), we obtain a quadratic form in [formula] and [formula], which can be now diagonalized by means of the following Bogoliubov transformation

[formula]

for all [formula], with  tanh 2β = g / (2 + g). Under this transformation H(1) becomes (up to an irrelevant additive constant)

[formula]

where

[formula]

In writing Eq. ([\ref=hw]) we have used the property, implied by Eq. ([\ref=bogo]), that [formula] and [formula] satisfy the same abelian Kac-Moody algebra with central charge c = 1 as the original operators [formula] and [formula] (cf. Eq. ([\ref=walg0])). Then, by means of the generalized Sugawara construction, we can define a new realization of the W1 +   ∞ algebra whose generators [formula] and [formula] are forms of degree (i + 1) in [formula] and [formula] respectively. Consequently, the effective hamiltonian, up to order 1 / N, becomes [\cite=flsz]

[formula]

and exhibits a left-right factorization in the new realization of the W1 +   ∞ algebra.

Notice that H(1 / N) is not diagonal on [formula], because the highest weight states of the new algebra do not coincide with the vectors |ΔN,ΔD〉0, as is clear from Eq. ([\ref=bogo]). However, the Bogoliubov transformation does not mix states belonging to different Verma moduli. This implies that the new highest weight vectors, |ΔN;ΔD〉W, are still characterized by the numbers ΔN and ΔD with the same meaning as before, but their charges are different. More precisely

[formula]

From the last two equations we deduce that [formula] and [formula] are still the modes of a compactified bosonic field, but on a circle of radius [formula]. This new field describes the density fluctuations of the interacting fermions.

The highest weight states |ΔN,ΔD〉W together with their descendants, denoted by [formula], form a new bosonic basis for our theory that has no simple expression in terms of the original free fermionic degrees of freedom. The main property of this new basis is that it diagonalizes the effective hamiltonian up to order 1 / N. In fact, using Eqs. ([\ref=h1n]) and ([\ref=vdo]), it is easy to check that

[formula]

where [\cite=kaya]

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula]. In the last line of Eq. ([\ref=fsize]), μ is the chemical potential and v the Fermi velocity. These eigenvalues are clearly degenerate when k  ≥  2 or [formula]. Examining their structure one concludes that the Calogero-Sutherland interaction induces, up to order 1 / N, three physical effects: a rescaling of the chemical potential

[formula]

a rescaling of the Fermi velocity of the particles

[formula]

a change in the compactification radius of the bosonic field describing the fermion density fluctuations

[formula]

Note that these effects have their origin in the backward scattering processes, which are the only interactions that contribute to the effective hamiltonian to order 1 / N. In particular, to lowest order in g, the change in the compactification radius is induced by the left-right mixing terms of H(1). Such terms are of the generic form [formula], and have conformal dimension (1,1). Therefore, they are marginal operators, which cannot destroy the conformal symmetry of the free theory, but only change the realization of the conformal algebra [\cite=bpz]. In fact, these operators drive the theory out from the free realization in terms of [formula] and [formula] to the interacting realization in terms of [formula] and [formula]. In this flow, the central charge of the conformal algebra remains unchanged, while the compactification radius of the bosonic field scales as indicated.

The rescalings of the chemical potential and the Fermi velocity are, instead, a normal ordering effect: to lowest order in g, they originate from the left and right diagonal terms proportional to g in H(0) and H(1), which arise from the two-body part of the backscattering hamiltonian in ([\ref=hdos]).

It is remarkable that despite their different origins, these rescalings are characterized by only one function of the coupling constant: the parameter λ. This fact implies the existence of relations among r,μ and v; for example, one has

[formula]

which is typical of the Luttinger model [\cite=lutt] [\cite=solyo] [\cite=hald]. It actually holds for all systems with hamiltonian of the form ([\ref=h1n]) to order 1 / N.

We should keep in mind that the derivation of the effective theory, as presented in Section [\ref=linear], is strictly perturbative; thus, an expansion in the coupling constant g should be understood in all previous formulae. However, if we limit our analysis to the 1 / N-terms, nothing prevents us from improving our results by extending them to all orders in g. Indeed, the Bogoliubov transformation ([\ref=bogo]) diagonalizes the hamiltonian H(1) exactly, and the resulting expression depends on the coupling constant only through λ, which contains all powers of g! This improvement is a well-known result in the Luttinger model [\cite=lutt] [\cite=solyo], but we would like to stress that in our case it can be done only if we disregard the O(1 / N2)-terms of the hamiltonian, because the Bogoliubov transformation ([\ref=bogo]) does not diagonalize H(2).

To investigate this issue, let us analyze the 1 / N2-term of the effective hamiltonian Eq. ([\ref=hcv2]). Using the generalized Sugawara construction, Eqs. ([\ref=mod0])-([\ref=mod2]), we first rewrite H(2) as a cubic form in [formula] and [formula], and then perform the Bogoliubov transformation ([\ref=bogo]) to re-express it in terms of the [formula] and [formula] generators. A straightforward calculation leads to H(2)  =  H(2)'   +   H(2)'' where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Neither H(2)' nor H(2)'' are diagonal on the states [formula] considered so far. In fact, these states are not in general eigenstates of [formula], and hence cannot be eigenstates of H(2)'; moreover, since they have definite values of k and [formula], they cannot be eigenstates of H(2)'' either, because this operator mixes the left and right sectors.

It is not difficult, however, to overcome these problems. Since H(2)' and H(1 / N) commute with each other, it is always possible to find suitable combinations of the states [formula] with fixed k and [formula] that diagonalize simultaneously H(2)' and H(1 / N), therefore lifting the degeneracy of the spectrum present to order 1 / N.

The term H(2)'', instead, has to be treated perturbatively, but only to first order in g. In fact to higher orders, the spurious states introduced with the limit Λ0  →    ∞   would also contribute as intermediate states. These contributions, however, would be meaningless because the hamiltonian to order O(1 / N2) is not even bounded below. From Eq. ([\ref=h2w'']) it is easy to check that H(2)'' has vanishing expectation value on any state that is simultaneously eigenstate of H(1 / N) and H(2)'. Thus, according to (non-degenerate) perturbation theory, H(2)'' has no effect on the energy spectrum to first order in g.

In view of these considerations, we neglect H(2)'' and regard as the effective hamiltonian the following operator

[formula]

Obviously, to be consistent with our perturbative approach, we should keep in the r.h.s. of Eq. ([\ref=hcsf]) only the terms that are linear in g.

We now compare the eigenvalues of HCS to the exact low-energy spectrum of the Calogero-Sutherland model obtained from the Bethe Ansatz method [\cite=sut] [\cite=kaya]. Any low-energy solution of the Bethe Ansatz equations [\cite=kore] is labeled by a set of integer numbers

[formula]

where N' = N  +  ΔN, and [formula]. The integers nj are ordered according to [formula] and are different from zero only if j  ≪  N (and analogously for the [formula]).

By generalizing to order 1 / N2 the procedure presented in Ref. [\cite=kaya], we have derived [\cite=flsz] the exact energy of the excitation described by the numbers ([\ref=Ii]):

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Of course, being an exact result, Eq. ([\ref=eba]) holds to all orders in g. Comparing Eqs. ([\ref=deflam]) and ([\ref=xi]), we see that

[formula]

Thus, to first order in g, Q and [formula] of Eq. ([\ref=Q]) coincide with the eigenvalues of W  00 and [formula] given in Eq. ([\ref=vdo]); conversely, these latter can be interpreted as the first-order approximation to the exact ones. From Eqs.([\ref=xi]) and ([\ref=Q]) one reads that the exact compactification radius [formula], chemical potential [formula] and Fermi velocity ṽ are given by Eqs. ([\ref=chempot])-([\ref=comprad]) with ξ in place of λ. Of course, due to Eq. ([\ref=xilam]), [formula], [formula] and ṽ coincide, respectively, with r, μ and v, to first order in g. It is worthwhile pointing out that all low-energy effects of the Calogero-Sutherland interaction are encoded entirely in a unique quantity, namely the parameter ξ, which in the Bethe Ansatz literature is known as dressed charge factor [\cite=kore].

Since the exact results can be obtained from the perturbative ones simply by changing λ into ξ, we are led to conjecture that the exact effective hamiltonian of the Calogero-Sutherland model CS is given by Eq. ([\ref=hcsf]) with ξ in place of λ. We may consider this operator as a non-perturbative improvement of HCS which was derived in perturbation theory.

Evidence for the validity of our conjecture, which is certainly true [\cite=kaya] to order 1 / N, is provided by the calculation of the eigenvalues of [formula]. In Ref. [\cite=flsz] we have checked on several explicit examples that these eigenvalues coincide with the exact energy of the low-lying excitations given by Eq. ([\ref=eba]).

We conclude by mentioning that the method of algebraic bosonization can be applied in principle to any (abelian) gapless fermionic hamiltonian consisting of a bilinear kinetic term and an arbitrary interaction. No special requirements on the form of the dispersion relation and the potential are needed. In particular, it is not necessary for the system to be integrable.

In Ref. [\cite=flsz] we have also discussed the algebraic bosonization of the Heisenberg model, by mapping it into a theory of fermions on a lattice by means of a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Also in this case the spectrum of the low-energy excitations can be obtained from the representation theory of the W1 +   ∞  algebra.
