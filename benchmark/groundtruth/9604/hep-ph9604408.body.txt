1. Introduction 0.1cm

We have heard from Martin[formula] and Altarelli[formula] on the experimental and theoretical aspects of the Rb - Rc problem. Rather than showing the offending "99.9% C.L." figure, let us give the result from the multiple parameter fit,

[formula]

vs. Standard Model (SM) values (for mt  =  180 GeV) RSMb  =  0.2156, and RSMc  =  0.172. Thus,

[formula]

From both experimental and theoretical considerations, nobody seems to like it this way (especially Rc). But, what if? We shall give here an ad hoc ( à la Altarelli,) but perhaps natural solution[formula] that offers absolutely tantalizing phenomenology in the near term.

0.4cm 2. Conservative approach for 0.1cm

Consider the minimal extension of adding just one charge + 2 / 3 isosinglet quark Q. One then has new gauge invariant mass terms LQR and LujR, and Yukawa coupling terms ūiLQR, where ui denotes standard up-type quarks. As a result, Q mixes with u, c and t. For sake of discussion, let us ignore 1st generation and set [formula] (i.e. discuss only "Cabibbo allowed" modes). One then has the charged current

[formula]

where [formula], [formula]. The isospin part of the neutral current becomes

[formula]

One sees that only the Zc coupling is affected at tree level,

[formula]

where [formula] and W are in standard notation. One finds

[formula]

Thus, interestingly, Rc moves down while Rb goes up! However, [formula] is a stringent constraint with 0.15% accuracy. Allowing for 2σ variation, and αS(mZ) values up to 0.126, taking mt  =  180 GeV and varying mH0 between 70 and 300 GeV, we find that higher αS and lower mH0 values are favored, with S22 varying between 0.007 and 0.009, and δRc, δRb between - 0.0024 and - 0.0032, 0.0006 and 0.0008, respectively. The direction is right, but far from sufficient. The reason can be traced to the smallness of [formula]. It would therefore be ideal if one could decrease Rc and increase Rb substantially, but keeping [formula]. That is, some fine-tuning is needed between δRc and δRb, and eq. (1) is not self-consistent.

In any case, this does not seem to be achieveable within minimal extensions of SM, including[formula] minimal SUSY (MSSM).

0.4cm 3. Radical, Provocative Possibility 0.2cm

Maintaining one singlet quark Q, let us in our minds relax on the requirement on "minimal" extension. One can now decouple the problem from [formula] and αS, since they are not intrinsically related to Rband Rc. Note that Q does not affect [formula] and d sectors directly, and large δRc is clearly possible, which just means large S2. The question now is whether δRb  ~    -  δRc (so δRh  ≈  0 is maintained) is possible with just one Q = 2 / 3 singlet quark. It turns out that this in fact occurs naturally in the "light, hidden top" scenario of ref. 4, where the top quark (doublet partner of b quark) is light, mH0  <  mt  <  MW, and the singlet quark Q is the observed heavy quark with mQ≃180 GeV. Here, the light top hides below MW because of induced t  →  cH0 decay dominating over the standard 3-body t  →  bW* decay.[formula]

The point is that this occurs only if both S2 and S3 are large, as can be seen from a formula similar to eq. (4). From eqs. (3) and (4), both t and Q would now enter the Zb loop vertex, since the GIM-breaking c, t and Q mixing modifies the charged and neutral currents. The leading effect can be summarized as a shift to an effective top mass,

[formula]

in the SM Zb vertex. That is, RSMb(mt) in eq. (7) should be replaced by RSMb(meff.t). Note that it has been known for a long time that the "Rb problem" itself can be phrased as Rexp.b favors lighter top quark mass. We find that if S22  +  S23  <  0.5 and S22  <  S23, meff.t  <  125 GeV. We therefore now have a new strategy: large S2 drives down Rc, while large S2 and S3 leads to the light top possibility which drives down Rb indirectly via loop corrections.

As an illustration of this strategy, let us take (in contrast to eq. (1))

[formula]

Thus, with Rc / RSMc≃0.940, we find from eq. (8) that

[formula]

which is larger than the values from previous section. Inserting this value of S2 into eq. (7), we find that RSMb(meff.t)  =  0.219, which implies that meff.t≃100 GeV. Taking mt  =  70 GeV and mQ  =  180 GeV, and solving eq. (9), we get

[formula]

which is larger than S22. Note that t is still dominantly the SU(2) partner of the b quark, which justifies our flavor label.

Two problems emerge behind our back at this point. First, a light top and mQ≃180 GeV in the W and Z two-point functions would result in too low a value for δρ (or, insufficient ΔT). In other words, [formula] comes back to haunt us in a different way. Second, one can check that the values of S2 and S3 from eqs. (11) and (12) are not large enough to support t  →  cH0 decay dominating over t  →  bW*. It is rather amusing, however, that both problems can be removed by the introduction of a second Higgs doublet that does not mix very much with the standard one. All one needs to do is to demand that mH+  >  v but mh0  <  MW, where h0 stands for lightest neutral (pseudo)scalar. In fact it is necessary to have mh0 as light as possible so that t  →  ch0 would not have any phase space suppression. A heavy H+ does not appear strongly in loop diagrams (such as b  →  sγ and B0-0 mixing), but provides a sizable extra ΔT via H+  -  h0 splitting. A very light h0 is possible if the accompanying nonstandard neutral Higgs is heavier than MZ. Thus, we find a viable solution to Rb - Rc problem at the cost of introducing an exotic singlet charge 2/3 quark and a second Higgs doublet, with parameters arranged in a rather special "corner".

0.4cm 5. Phenomenological Discussion 0.2cm

For sake of space, let us summarize the tantalizing phenomenological consequences of this peculiar but not unnatural solution:

t  →  ch0 is dominant over t  →  bW* but not overwhelmingly so. Thus, Tevatron should restudy the mt  <  MW region for BR(t  →  eν  +  X) not much smaller than 1/18.

The leading Q decays are Q  →  bW, sW; tH, tZ; cH, cZ, with relative weights 66.3%, 5.4%, 14.6%, 7.3%, 3.3%, 3.0%, respectively. Thus, more than 70% of Q decays contain W's, while, since t  →  cH0, bW* and H0  →  b, the b quark content of Q decay is close to unity. Both are in agreement with recent CDF results.[formula]

BR(Z  →  t  +  c)  ~   few ×  10- 4. One should search for the [formula] signal.

Dramatic consequences at LEP-II: TOPONIUM afterall!? Open top could also appear during the LEP 1.6 run next summer, with an extremely light Higgs as a further bonus.
