Simultaneous Identification of the Diffusion Coefficient and the Potential for the Schrödinger Operator with only one Observation

and Patricia Gaitan

Introduction

Let [formula] be an unbounded strip of [formula] with a fixed width d > 0. Let ν be the outward unit normal to Ω on Γ  =  ∂Ω. We denote x = (x1,x2) and [formula], where Γ+  =  {x∈Γ;  x2 = 2d} and Γ-  =  {x∈Γ;  x2 = d}. We consider the following Schrödinger equation

[formula]

where a and b are real-valued functions such that [formula], [formula] and a(x)  ≥  amin > 0. Moreover, we assume that a is bounded and b and all its derivatives up to order two are bounded. If we assume that q0 belongs to H4(Ω) and [formula], then ([\ref=systq]) admits a solution in [formula]. Our problem can be stated as follows: Is it possible to determine the coefficients a and b from the measurement of ∂ν(∂2tq) on Γ+? Let q (resp. [formula]) be a solution of ([\ref=systq]) associated with (a, b, F, q0) (resp. ([formula], [formula], F, q0)). We assume that q0 is a real valued function.

Our main result is

[formula]

where C is a positive constant which depends on (Ω,Γ,T) and where the above norms are weighted Sobolev norms. This paper is an improvement of the work [\cite=LMP] in the sense that we simultaneously determine with only one observation, two independent coefficients, the diffusion coefficient and the potential. We use for that two important tools: Carleman estimate ([\ref=carl-est-2]) and Lemma [\ref=lemBK]. Carleman inequalities constitute a very efficient tool to derive observability estimates. The method of Carleman estimates has been introduced in the field of inverse problems by Bukhgeim and Klibanov (see [\cite=B], [\cite=BK], [\cite=K1], [\cite=K2]). Carleman estimates techniques are presented in [\cite=KT] for standard coefficients inverse problems for both linear and non-linear partial differential equations. These methods give a local Lipschitz stability around a single known solution. A lot of works using the same strategy concern the wave equation (see [\cite=LTY], [\cite=Be], [\cite=BMO]) and the heat equation (see [\cite=PY], [\cite=IY01], [\cite=BGLR]). For the determination of a time-independent potential in Schrödinger evolution equation, we can refer to [\cite=BP] for bounded domains and [\cite=LMP] for unbounded domains. We can also cite [\cite=MOR] where the authors use weight functions satisfying a relaxed pseudo-convexity condition which allows to prove Carleman inequalities with less restrictive boundary observations. Up to our knowledge, there are few results concerning the simultaneous identification of two coefficients with only one observation. In [\cite=LP] a stability result is given for the particular case where each coefficient only depends on one variable (a = a(x2) and b = b(x1)) for the operator [formula] in an unbounded strip of [formula] The authors give a stability result for the diffusion coefficient a and the potential b with only one observation in an unbounded part of the boundary. A physical background could be the reconstruction of the diffusion coefficient and the potential in a strip in geophysics. There are also applications in quantum mechanics: inverse problems associated with curved quantum guides (see [\cite=CDFK], [\cite=DE], [\cite=DEK]). This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to some usefull estimates. We first give an adapted global Carleman estimate for the operator H. We then recall the crucial Lemma given in [\cite=KT]. In Section 3 we state and prove our main result.

Some Usefull Estimates

Global Carleman Inequality

Let a be a real-valued function in [formula] and b be a real-valued function in [formula] such that Let q(x,t) be a function equals to zero on ∂Ω  ×  ( - T,T) and solution of the Schrödinger equation

[formula]

We prove here a global Carleman-type estimate for q with a single observation acting on a part Γ+ of the boundary Γ in the right-hand side of the estimate. Note that this estimate is quite similar to the one obtained in [\cite=LMP], but the computations are different. Indeed, the weigth function β does not satisfy the same pseudo-convexity assumptions (see Assumption [\ref=funct-beta]) and the decomposition of the operator H is different (see ([\ref=M1])). Let [formula] be a [formula] positive function such that there exists positive constants C0,Cpc which satisfy where

[formula]

Note that the last assertion of Assumption [\ref=funct-beta] expresses the pseudo-convexity condition for the function β. This Assumption imposes restrictive conditions for the choice of the diffusion coefficient a in connection with the function [formula] as in [\cite=LMP]. Note that there exist functions satisfying such assumptions. Indeed if we assume that (x): = (x2), these conditions can be written in the following form:

[formula]

and

[formula]

For example (x) = e- x2 with [formula] satisfy the previous conditions (with x2∈(d,2d)).

Then, we define [formula] with [formula] and m > 1. For λ  >  0 and t∈( - T,T), we define the following weight functions

[formula]

We set ψ = e- sηq, Mψ  =  e- sηH(esηψ) for s > 0. Let H be the operator defined by

[formula]

Following [\cite=BP], we introduce the operators :

[formula]

Then

[formula]

where [formula] is the conjugate of z, [formula] its real part and [formula] its imaginary part. Then the following result holds.

Let H, M1, M2 be the operators defined respectively by ([\ref=H]), ([\ref=M1]). We assume that Assumptions [\ref=ab] and [\ref=funct-beta] are satisfied. Then there exist λ0  >  0, s0 > 0 and a positive constant C = C(Ω,Γ,T) such that, for any λ  ≥  λ0 and any s  ≥  s0, the next inequality holds:

[formula]

[formula]

for all q satisfying [formula] ∂νq∈L2( - T,T;L2(Γ)). Moreover we have

[formula]

[formula]

Proof: We have to estimate the scalar product

[formula]

with

Following [\cite=BP], using integrations by part and Young estimates, we get ([\ref=carl-est-1]). Moreover from ([\ref=M1]) we have:

[formula]

So

[formula]

And we deduce ([\ref=carl-est-2]) from ([\ref=carl-est-1]).

The Crucial Lemma

We recall in this section the proof of a very important lemma proved by Klibanov and Timonov (see for example [\cite=K2], [\cite=KT]).

There exists a positive constant κ such that

[formula]

for all s  >  0.

Proof : By the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, we have

[formula]

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

So, if we denote by α(x) = e2λK - eλβ(x), we have

[formula]

For the first integral of the right hand side of ([\ref=estBK]), by integration by parts we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Here we used α(x)  >  0 for all [formula] and we obtain

[formula]

Similarly for the second integral of the right hand side of ([\ref=estBK])

[formula]

Thus the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemBK] is completed.

Stability result

In this section, we establish a stability inequality for the diffusion coefficient a and the potential b. Let q∈C2(Ω  ×  (0,T)) be solution of

[formula]

and [formula] be solution of

[formula]

where (a,b) and [formula] both satisfy Assumption [\ref=ab]. Since q0 is a real-valued function, we can extend the function q (resp. [formula]) on Ω  ×  ( - T,T) by the formula [formula] for every (x,t)∈Ω  ×  ( - T,0). Note that this extension satisfies the previous Carleman estimate. Our main stability result is

Let q and [formula] be solutions of ([\ref=systq]) in C2(Ω  ×  (0,T)) such that [formula]. We assume that Assumptions [\ref=ab], [\ref=funct-beta], [\ref=tildeq] are satisfied. Then there exists a positive constant C = C(Ω,Γ,T) such that for s and λ large enough,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

where the previous norms are weighted Sobolev norms.

Proof: We denote by u = q - , α  =  ã - a and γ  =   - b, so we get:

[formula]

The proof will be done in two steps: in a first step we prove an estimation for α and in a second step for γ. First step: We set [formula] Then from ([\ref=systu]) u1 is solution of

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] Then defining u2  =  ∂tu1 we get that u2 satisfies

[formula]

where A12  =  ∂tA11, A22 = A11, B12  =  ∂tB11, B12 = B11. Now let [formula] then u3 is solution of

[formula]

where Ai3 and Bi3 are bounded functions. If we denote by [formula], then

[formula]

At last we define u4  =  ∂tu3 and u4 satisfies

[formula]

where Ai4 and Bi4 are still bounded functions. Note that [formula] Applying the Carleman inequality ([\ref=carl-est-2]) for u4 we obtain (for s and λ sufficiently large):

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Note that [formula], so from Lemma [\ref=lemBK] we get

[formula]

[formula]

By the same way, we have

[formula]

[formula]

So ([\ref=u_4]) becomes

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Furthermore from ([\ref=u3]) we have (with C a positive constant)

[formula]

Therefore for s sufficiently large, from Lemma [\ref=lemBK]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Using ([\ref=u4]) we get

[formula]

and then

[formula]

[formula]

Second step: By the same way we obtain an estimation of γ. We set

[formula]

Following the same methodology as in the first step, we obtain:

[formula]

[formula]

From ([\ref=alpha]) and ([\ref=gamma]) we can conclude.

Note that the following function (x,t) = e- it + x22 + 5 with [formula] (x) =  - 1 satisfies Assumption [\ref=tildeq].

This method works for the Schrödinger operator in the divergential form:

[formula]

We still obtain a similar stability result but with more restrictive hypotheses on the regularity of the function [formula].
