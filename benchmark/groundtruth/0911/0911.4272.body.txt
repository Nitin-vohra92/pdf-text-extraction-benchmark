Angle measures of some cones associated with finite reflection groups

P. V. Bibikov, V. S. Zhgoon

Let V be a Euclidean vector space of dimension n with the inner product (  ·  ,  ·  ). For a convex polyhedral cone C we denote by [formula] its open kernel, by 〈C〉 its linear span, and by C* its dual cone, i.e. [formula]. Denote by σ(C) the relative angle measure of C, i.e. [formula], where B  ⊂  〈C〉 is the unit ball centered at the origin. Let F be a k-dimensional face of some solid cone C. By C / F we denote the orthogonal projection of C to the subspace [formula]. We note that (C / F)* is an (n - k)-dimensional face of C* that is orthogonal to F.

Let now W  ⊂  O(V) be a finite reflection group. Set Wk  =  {w∈W: dim  ker (1 - w) = k} and denote [formula]. For a subspace U  ⊂  V we denote by WU the subgroup of W that fixes U pointwise.

The aim of this paper is to prove the following theorem conjectured by the first author in [\cite=BiUMN].

For a fundamental cone C of a finite reflection group W and for each [formula] we have

[formula]

where F runs over the k-dimensional faces of C.

The following two results are crucial for the proof of Theorem [\ref=th.obch.]. The first one is the fundamental result of Waldspurger [\cite=Wald], for the simplest proof of which we refer the reader to [\cite=BiZhUMN] [\cite=BiZhIAN]. The second one is the so-called "Curious Identity" of De Concini and Procesi [\cite=ConPro] (see also [\cite=BiUMN] [\cite=Den]).

[formula].

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=W] implies that [formula] Thus we obtain

[formula]

It is easy to see from the previous proof that the number of cones wC* covering a generic point of V is equal to [formula].

Consider the sum [formula] over all pairs (C,F), where C is a fundamental cone of W and F is a k-dimensional face of C. This sum is equal to the left hand side of the required formula multiplied by |W|. We shall calculate S in a different way.

Let us recall that any two fundamental cones of W with a common face F are conjugate by a unique element of the reflection subgroup WF that fixes F pointwise. We also note that C / F is a fundamental cone for the action of WF on [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=DC] we have [formula]. If we take the sum of σ((C / F)*) over all C that contain a fixed face F, we get [formula]. The group WF and the measure σ((C / F)*) depend only on the subspace U: = 〈F〉 that is an intersection of reflection hyperplanes. Let us take the sum of σ(F)  ·  σ((C / F)*) over all pairs (C,F) such that F  ⊂  U for a fixed k-dimensional space U. We get [formula] multiplied by the total measure of faces F  ⊂  U, which is equal to one, since the faces F decompose U. Taking the sum over all subspaces U we obtain S = |Wk|.

Denote by NF the subgroup of W normalizing 〈F〉. Consider the sum [formula] of relative angle measures for the W-translates of the k-dimensional faces F'  ⊂  C that are equivalent to F. It is the same as the total measure of the W-translates of F'  ⊂  〈F〉. The latter is equal to |W| / |NF| multiplied by the total measure of the faces F'  ⊂  〈F〉 which is equal to 1. Thus we get [formula]. Using Theorems [\ref=th.obch.], [\ref=DC] and applying the previous equality we get:

[formula]

where the first sum is taken over representatives of all equivalence classes of k-dimensional faces F  ⊂  C.
