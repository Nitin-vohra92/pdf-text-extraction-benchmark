Kobayashi-Royden pseudometric vs. Lempert function

Let [formula] be the open unit disc. Fix a domain [formula] We recall the definitions of the Lempert function lD and the Kobayashi-Royden pseudometric κD of D:

[formula]

where z,w∈D and [formula]

By a result of M.-Y. Pang (see [\cite=Pang]), the Kobayashi-Royden metric is the "derivative" of the Lempert function for taut domains in [formula] (such domains are pseudoconvex). More precisely, one can show that if [formula] is a taut domain (i.e. [formula] is a normal family), then

[formula]

([formula]). For a more general result see [\cite=Nik-Pfl]. There it is also proved that

[formula]

for any domain [formula] Note that there is a bounded pseudoconvex domain [formula] containing the origin such that [formula] does not exist (cf. [\cite=Zwo]), where X: = (1,1). Therefore, taking lim sup  in the previous definition is needed.

The aim of this note is to show that, in general, the inequality

[formula]

is a strict one.

Denote by M3 the set of all 3  ×  3 complex matrices and by [formula] the spectral unit ball, i.e. the set of all matrices from M3 with all their eigenvalues in [formula]

For a matrix C∈M3 with eigenvalues λ1,λ2,λ3, we define

[formula]

Recall that [formula] is the so-called symmetrized three-disc. We will need that [formula] is a taut domain (even hyperconvex, see e.g. [\cite=Edi-Zwo]).

Put

[formula]

where ω: = e2πi / 3. Set B: = B0. Now we can formulate our result.

[formula]

Moreover, let [formula] (Cj)j  ⊂  M3 (Cj = (cjk,l)) be such that tj  →  0, Cj  →  B, and lim inf j  →    ∞|cj3,2 / tj - 3| > 0. Then

[formula]

Since κD and lD have the product property, it follows that, in general, the inequality ([\ref=2]) is strict for pseudoconvex domains in [formula] for any n  ≥  9. In fact, the proof below shows that [formula] where [formula] is the set of all traceless matrices in Ω3. So the inequality in ([\ref=2]) is strict for the pseudoconvex domain [formula] This remark is due to Pascal J. Thomas.

Problem. It would be interesting to find such examples also in lower dimensions, as well as to see if, in general, the inequality ([\ref=1]) is strict (as it is conjectured in [\cite=Nik-Pfl]).

Note that the condition in Proposition [\ref=Prop-Ex](b) implies that the matrices A + tjCj are cyclic for large j (which is, in fact, what we need in the proof). We point out that without the lim inf -condition the claim in Proposition [\ref=Prop-Ex](b) might not hold. Indeed, we have the following result.

[formula] In particular,

[formula]

Before we prove Proposition [\ref=Prop-Ex] we need the following preparation which is based on [\cite=Tho-Tra]. Recall that M∈M3 is said to be cyclic if M has a cyclic vector, i.e. [formula] for some [formula]; for many equivalent properties see e.g. [\cite=Hor-Joh].

Let M∈Ω3 be cyclic and [formula] be such that φ(0) = 0 and φ(α) = σ(M) ([formula]). Then there exists a [formula] satisfying ψ(0) = A, ψ(α) = M and [formula] if and only if φ3'(0) = 0.

In particular,

[formula]

and (since [formula] is a taut domain) there is an extremal disc for lΩ3(A,M).

For the convenience of the Reader we give the proof.

If such a ψ exists, then straightforward calculations show that [formula]

Conversely, assume that φ3'(0) = 0. Put

[formula]

Then ψ̃(0) = A and [formula] Note also that (0,0,1) is a cyclic vector for ψ̃(ζ) if ζ  ≠  0. So ψ̃(α) is a cyclic matrix with the same spectrum as the cyclic matrix M and hence they are conjugate (cf. [\cite=Hor-Joh]). It remains to write M in the form M = e- Sψ̃(α)eS for some S∈M3 and to set ψ(ζ) = e-  ζS / αψ̃(ζ)eζS / α.

Now we are able to present the proof of Proposition [\ref=Prop-Ex].

In virtue of Example [\ref=counter], we have only to verify that

[formula]

under the above condition on the cj3,2.

STEP 1. First we prove that the lim inf -condition implies that A + tjCj are cyclic matrices for sufficiently large j's. Assume that all (otherwise take an appropriate subsequence) A + tjCj are non cyclic matrices. Therefore, their minimal polynomials are of degree less than 3 (cf. [\cite=Hor-Joh]). So their degrees are equal to 2 for sufficiently large j. Then

[formula]

where [formula], and E denotes the unit matrix in M3. So we get 9 equations; each of them is denoted by [formula], where the indices k and [formula] denote the row and the column, respectively. Looking at equation Ej2,3 we get xj / tj  →  1. Putting this into equation Ej1,1 leads to yj / t2j  →   - 2. Finally, equation Ej2,2 implies that cj3,2 / tj  →  2 - ω  -  ω2 = 3; a contradiction.

STEP 2. By step 1 we know that all matrices A + tjCj are cyclic and belong to Ω3 if j  ≥  j0. Calculations show that

[formula]

with f1(Cj)  →  0, f2(Cj)  →  0, and f3(Cj)  →  0.

Put

[formula]

where [formula]. Then [formula] with φj(0) = 0, φj,3'(0) = 0, and φj(rj) = σ(A + tjCj). Hence, by Lemma [\ref=lift-1],

[formula]

Hence the proof is finished.

Finally we present the proof of the example.

Since [formula] for any [formula] it follows that [formula]

By (1), it remains to show that [formula]

Note that A + tBt is similar to the matrix Dt  =  (t,t, - 2t) and hence lΩ3(A,A + tBt) = lΩ3(A,Dt) (use the same argument as the one at the end of the proof of Lemma [\ref=lift-1]).

Let [formula], tj  →  0, such that lΩ3(A,Dtj) / |tj|  →  c.

Now choose [formula] such that ψj(0) = A, ψ(αj) = Dtj, and αj / tj = |αj| / |tj|  →  c. Setting

[formula]

we have the following equations:

[formula]

[formula]

Then straightforward calculations show that φ'j,3(0) = 0 and

[formula]

Writing

[formula]

the last condition becomes

[formula]

(use that θj,1(αj) = 0, θj,2(αj) =  - 3t2j  /  αj and θj,3(αj) =  - 2t3j  /  α2j). Since [formula] is a taut domain, passing to a subsequence, we may assume that [formula] and ρ1(0) = 0. Then the equation ([\ref=prel]) implies that

[formula]

where k: = 1 / c.

It follows by [\cite=Nik] (see also [\cite=Edi-Zwo]) that [formula] is a (logarithmically) plurisubharmonic function with [formula]. In fact, hG3 is the Minkowski function of the (1,2,3)-balanced domain [formula]. Since

[formula]

the maximum principle for plurisubharmonic functions implies that [formula] on [formula]. In particular, [formula]. Therefore, all zeros of the polynomial P(λ): = λ3  -  ρ1(0)λ2  +  ρ2(0)λ  -  ρ3(0), lie in [formula]. Note that P(λ) = (λ - k)(λ2 + kλ + k2  +  ρ2(0)); hence c  ≥  1.
