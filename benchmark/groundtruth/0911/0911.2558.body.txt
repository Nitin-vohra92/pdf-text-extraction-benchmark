Topological Stability of Majorana Zero Modes in Superconductor-Topological Insulator Systems

Majorana bound states have recently been attracting much interest as elementary excitations obeying non-Abelian statistics [\cite=ReaGre00]. They have been predicted in ν = 5 / 2 quantum Hall effects, [\cite=ReaGre00] p-wave superconductors, [\cite=ReaGre00] [\cite=Ivanov01] [\cite=SOM04] [\cite=SNT06] [\cite=TSL07] topological insulators with the proximity effect of s-wave superconductors[\cite=FuKan08] as well as of ferromagnetic insulators,[\cite=TYN09] s-wave superfluids of ultracold fermionic atoms[\cite=STF09], vacuum states of superfluid 3He-B,[\cite=Vol09] superconducting states in graphene, [\cite=Her09-1] and massive Dirac equations in magnetic fields.[\cite=Her09-2] Recently, Teo and Kane [\cite=TeoKan09] have proposed a model of superconductor-topological insulator systems in three dimensions. They have shown that the third Chern number, which is a topological invariant for three-dimensional topological insulators, [\cite=QHZ08] reduces to a winding number of order parameters on a two-dimensional sphere surrounding a pointlike topological defect. This suggests that the Majorana zero modes have a topological origin and are stably protected from perturbations. This property may play a crucial role in the application of Majorana zero modes to topological quantum computations.[\cite=Kitaev03] [\cite=NSSFS08] Along this line, Tewari et. al. have established a theorem for the existence of Majorana zero modes in chiral p-wave superconductors[\cite=TSL07] and in spin-orbit-coupled semiconductors.[\cite=TSS09]

In this paper, we derive an index theorem for the Majorana zero modes in a model of superconductor-topological insulator systems. To be concrete, we establish the relationship between the sum of chiralities of the Majorana zero modes and a topological invariant associated with order parameters. This indicates that the Majorana zero modes in such systems are stable owing to their topological origin. When we derive the above index theorem, we use a simplified model that has not only particle-hole symmetry, as the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians should have, but also an additional chiral symmetry. We next discuss the effects of chiral symmetry breaking perturbations, especially those of the chemical potential term. We suggest that the number of zero modes is classified by Z2. Namely, only the evenness or oddness of the number of zero modes in models with chiral symmetry is invariant under chiral symmetry breaking perturbations. This is consistent with the results obtained by Tewari et. al.[\cite=TSL07] Finally, we present a concrete zero mode wave function for the Fu-Kane model [\cite=FuKan08] in both the cases of μ = 0 and [formula].

Let H be a Hamiltonian defined by where [formula] and [formula], and γμ ([formula]) are γ matrices in 2d dimensions {γμ,γν} = 2δμν. [formula] stands for a set of order parameters. This Hamiltonian has been introduced by Kane and his collaborators [\cite=FuKan08] [\cite=TeoKan09] as a minimal model describing superconductor-topological insulator systems. In the case of d = 2, [formula] is the model proposed by Fu and Kane [\cite=FuKan08] to study a Majorana zero mode in a vortex of an s-wave superconductor, where (r,θ) are the polar coordinates in two dimensions. In the case of d = 3, [formula] describes generic superconductor-topological insulator systems studied by Teo and Kane [\cite=TeoKan09], where the region m < 0 corresponds to a bulk topological insulator, with the proximity effect [formula] induced by a superconductor. If [formula] is constant, the spectrum of the Hamiltonian has a gap, describing a massive Dirac particle. Even with a more generic [formula] that is not spatially uniform, the spectrum may still be massive. However, if [formula] has a topological defect, there appear bound states around it. In particular, it has been shown[\cite=FuKan08] [\cite=TeoKan09] that the present model ([\ref=Ham]) can admit generically bound states sitting exactly at zero energy. To study such zero modes bound to a pointlike defect, we assume that away from the defect located at x = 0, the asymptotic form of the order parameter [formula] is given by The explicit expression for γ matrices is not necessary,[\cite=footnote1] but we have to arrange them to obey CγjC- 1  =  γj and CγaC- 1 =  - γa, where C (C2 = 1) is the anti-unitary operator [\cite=footnote1] describing particle-hole symmetry. Therefore, the Hamiltonian ([\ref=Ham]) has particle-hole symmetry, as it should be in the case of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians. The wave function of the zero modes can be chosen such that φ0,i(x) = Cφ0,j(x), which has been referred to as a Majorana fermion mode. Another symmetry of the Hamiltonian ([\ref=Ham]) is chiral symmetry denoted by where [formula] with the property Cγ5C- 1  =  γ5. It should be noted that the γ5 matrix is that in 2d dimensions in the ordinary sense, although we are dealing with a model in d spatial dimensions. This symmetry seems artificial, since the chemical potential term and many other terms with some products of γ matrices break chiral symmetry. According to the Altland-Zirnbauer classification scheme [\cite=Zir96] [\cite=AltZir97], the model only with particle-hole symmetry ([\ref=ParHol]) is classified as class D, which is the most generic class of superconductors, whereas the model with an additional symmetry ([\ref=Chi]) belongs to class BDI, which is the time reversal invariant chiral class.[\cite=SRFL08] [\cite=Kitaev08]

Even with such an enhanced symmetry (and although we have neglected background gauge fields for simplicity), the minimal model ([\ref=Ham]) is nevertheless useful for clarifying the topological stability of the Majorana zero modes, as we shall show momentarily. When d = 2, it has a deep relationship with a Dirac fermion coupled to a Higgs field with a vortex background [\cite=JacRos81]. Jackiw and Rossi [\cite=JacRos81] have derived the zero mode wave functions of this model explicitly. It has been shown by Weinberg [\cite=Wei81] that these zero modes are indeed ensured by the index theorem, even though this model is defined for the noncompact two-dimensional space R2. The model in three dimensions is associated with a Dirac fermion coupled to a Higgs field with a 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole [\cite=tHooft] [\cite=Polyakov] background whose index theorem, surprisingly valid for open and odd-dimensional spaces, has been derived by Callias [\cite=Callias78]. In what follows, we first prove the index theorem for the Hamiltonian ([\ref=Ham]) simultaneously in d = 2 and d = 3 cases using the method developed by Weinberg[\cite=Wei81], and next, we discuss the effect of the chemical potential that breaks chiral symmetry.

Let us first define the index of the Hamiltonian ([\ref=Ham]) by ind  H = N+ - N-, where N± denote, respectively, the number of zero modes of ([\ref=Ham]), Hφ±0,i = 0, with ±   chirality, γ5φ±0,i  =    ±  φ±0,i. This can be written as where Tr denotes the trace over the space coordinates as well as the γ matrices. On the other hand, it is well-known that in the large mass limit, the same quantity yields the topological invariant where cd is the dth Chern number [\cite=FujSuz05] if d =  even, while cd = 0 if d =  odd. It is possible to express Tr in both eqs. ([\ref=Ind]) and ([\ref=TopInv]) using the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, Hφn  =  λnφn. In the case of nonzero energies, [formula] has the energy [formula], and hence, these two states are orthogonal to each other, [formula]. Then, it is easy to see that eqs. ([\ref=Ind]) and ([\ref=TopInv]) give the same index of the Hamiltonian. However, in the plane-wave basis, the above two quantities become two kinds of different invariants, giving a nontrivial relationship between them. The necessity of two kinds of masses is manifested when the axial-vector current is introduced such that where tr denotes the trace over the γ matrices, and in deriving the second line, we have used the fact that
