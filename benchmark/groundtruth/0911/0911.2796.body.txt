ThReT: A new survey for Extrasolar Planetary transits at Mt. Holomon, Greece

Introduction

ThReT is a new photometric survey initiated at the Aristotle University‘s facilities at Mt. Holomon, Chalkidiki. The latter offers sub-arcsecond seeing (mean value 0.82”) conditions and limited light pollution skies. The employed instruments for the survey are a Celestron11” f/6.3 telescope and a Fingerlakes PL6303E front illuminated CCD camera, mounted on a Synta EQ-6 german mount and guided through a smaller Konus 4” reflector. The achieved pixel scale is 1.32 arcsec and the field of view is 58x33 arcmin. We use no optical filter for our observations.

Target selection-Transit Detection Probability

We locate the promising spots on the celestial sphere by segmenting the Tycho catalogue into virtual fields of view of size equal to the field of view of our instrument. We then derive the astrophysical parameters of each main sequence star that our instrument can observe and calculate the overall Transit Detection Probability of each field of view. We finally visualize the results with Transit Probability Maps and locate the promising spots for observation for each season [\citep=hlacc].

Data Reduction

We have developed the ThReT pipeline to reduce the data of our survey. The pipeline initially corrects the images for bias and dark noise, pixel-to-pixel (flat fielding), and non-linear response of the CCD chip. It then uses DAOPHOT II[\citep=st1987] to perform either aperture or PSF photometry, regarding the density of the stars within the field. After deriving the light-curves, the pipeline uses ensemble photometry [\citep=ho1992], the Sys-Rem algorithm [\citep=ta2005] and the TFA algorithm [\citep=ko2005], to remove systematic noise. We search for variable stars by employing the Pulsation Index [\citep=kj1992] and the PDM algorithm. The light-curves are also scanned for transit-like signals with the BLS algorithm [\citep=ko2002].

Preliminary results

In order to test the instrumentation and the data reduction pipeline, we observed the field α:22:53:40, δ: + 44300.0 for five continuous nights between 23/07/2008 and 27/07/2008. We refer to that field as ExoField  #  1. The later has 71.99% probability for transit detection. The exposure time was 120 sec and the time interval between the exposures was 20 sec. With those observational parameters, we reached < 2% precision photometry for stars between 9 mag and 14 mag. We have detected several variable candidates (more than 15 so far). We have also detected a transit - like event at the star α:225440, δ: + 445848. The star is USNO - A2.01275 - 17995584, its spectral type is K0 but it is unknown if it belongs to the Main-Sequence.

Future work

We plan to re-observe ExoField  #  1 in order to further investigate the discovered variable stars and determine their types. We shall also further investigate the suspected planet. If a transit re-occurs then we will undertake follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations in order to determine the nature of the variability.
