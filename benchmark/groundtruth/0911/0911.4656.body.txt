Introduction

Collapses are a classical notion in Combinatorial Topology, originally introduced in the Thirties by Whitehead [\cite=Whitehead], extensively studied in the Sixties by Bing, Cohen, Lickorish and Zeeman among others, yet also at the center of recent works such as [\cite=BarmakMinian] and [\cite=Crowley].

Given a polytopal (or a regular CW) complex, a collapse is a move that cancels two faces and yields a smaller complex which is topologically a strong deformation retract of the starting one. Any complex that is collapsible (i.e. transformable into a point via a sequence of collapses) is thus also contractible. Conversely, every shellable contractible complex is collapsible.

However, not all contractible complexes are collapsible: A famous two-dimensional counterexample is given by Zeeman's dunce hat [\cite=ZeemanDunceHat]. According to the work of Whitehead [\cite=Whitehead] and Cohen [\cite=Cohen1], a complex C is contractible if and only if some collapsible complex D collapses also onto C. In fact, one can construct a collapsible triangulated 3-ball with only 8 vertices that collapses onto a copy of the dunce hat [\cite=BenedettiLutz]. Cohen's result is obtained by taking products: Zeeman [\cite=ZeemanDunceHat] first noticed that the product of the dunce hat with a segment [formula] is polyhedrally collapsible and asked whether the same holds for any contractible 2-complex. (The question, known as Zeeman's conjecture, is still open [\cite=HAMS]. For polyhedral collapsibility, see e.g. [\cite=Hudson].)

Cohen [\cite=Cohen1] showed that the product of any contractible d-complex C with the q-dimensional cube [formula] polyhedrally collapses onto a point, provided q  ≥   max (2d,5). At the same time, [formula] collapses onto C (cf. Corollary [\ref=cor:cohen]).

It was first discovered by Bing [\cite=BING] that some triangulations of 3-balls are not collapsible. For each d  ≥  3, Lickorish [\cite=LICK] proved that some triangulated d-balls of the form S  -  Δ (with S a d-sphere and Δ a facet of S) are not collapsible. Bing's and Lickorish's claim were recently strengthened by the author and Ziegler [\cite=BZ], who showed that for each d  ≥  3 certain triangulated d-balls of the form S  -  Δ do not even collapse onto any (d - 2)-dimensional subcomplex of S. These three results were all obtained via knot theory. In fact, a 3-ball may contain arbitrarily complicated three-edge-knots in its 1-skeleton. Depending on how complicated the knot is, one can draw sharp conclusions on the collapsibility of the 3-ball and of its successive suspensions.

In the Nineties, two quantum physicists, Durhuus and Jonsson [\cite=DJ], introduced the term "LC d-manifold" to describe a manifold that can be obtained from a tree of d-polytopes by repeatedly identifying two combinatorially equivalent adjacent (d - 1)-faces in the boundary (d  ≥  2). Plenty of spheres satisfy this bizarre requirement: In fact, all shellable and all constructible d-spheres are LC (cf. [\cite=BZ]). At the same time, simplicial LC d-manifolds are only exponentially many when counted with respect to the number of facets, while arbitrary (simplicial) d-manifolds are much more numerous [\cite=Benedetti-diss].

Durhuus and Jonsson noticed that the class of LC d-manifolds coincides with the class of all d-spheres for d = 2. But what about higher dimensions?

For d = 3, they were able to prove one of the two inclusions, namely, that all LC 3-manifolds are spheres [\cite=DJ]. The other inclusion does not hold: For each d  ≥  3, some d-spheres are not LC, as established in [\cite=BZ]. The examples of non-LC spheres are given by 3-spheres with a three-edge-knot in their 1-skeleton (provided the knot is sufficiently complicated!) and by their successive suspensions.

The analogy with the aforementioned obstructions to collapsibility is not a coincidence: In fact, the LC d-spheres can be characterized [\cite=BZ] as the d-spheres that collapse onto a (d - 2)-complex after the removal of a facet. (It does not matter which facet you choose.) This characterization can be easily extended to (closed) manifolds:

A d-manifold M is LC if and only if M minus a facet collapses onto a (d - 2)-complex.

Exploiting this characterization, in the present paper we prove the following statement:

The proof, which is elementary, can be outlined as follows: Suppose a manifold M (resp. M') minus a facet collapses onto a ( dim   M - 2)-complex C (resp. a ( dim   M' - 2)-complex C'). We show that the complex obtained by removing a facet from M  ×  M' collapses onto the complex [formula], which is ( dim M  +   dim M' - 2)-dimensional.

As a corollary, we immediately obtain that some LC 4-manifolds are not spheres, but rather products of two LC 2-spheres. This enables us to solve Durhuus-Jonsson's problem for all dimensions:

By the work of Zeeman (see e.g. [\cite=BJOE]), for every positive integer d, every shellable or constructible d-manifold is a d-sphere. Thus, the properties of shellability and constructibility are obviously not inherited by products. All 2-spheres are LC, constructible and shellable; however, for each d  ≥  3, all shellable d-spheres are constructible, all constructible d-spheres are LC, but some LC d-spheres are not constructible [\cite=BZ]. It is still unknown whether all constructible spheres are shellable.

Definitions

A polytopal complex is a finite, nonempty collection C of polytopes (called the faces of C) in some Euclidean space [formula], such that (1) if σ is a polytope in C then all the faces of σ are elements of C and (2) the intersection of any two polytopes of C is a face of both. If d is the largest dimension of a polytope of C, the polytopal complex C is called d-complex. An inclusion-maximal face of C is called facet. A d-complex is simplicial (resp. cubical) if all of its facets are simplices (resp. cubes). Given an a-complex A and a b-complex B, the product C  =  A  ×  B is an (a + b)-complex whose nonempty faces are the products Pα  ×  Pβ, where Pα (resp. Pβ) ranges over the nonempty polytopes of A (resp. B). In general, the product of two simplicial complexes is not a simplicial complex, while the product of two cubical complexes is a cubical complex.

Let C be a d-complex. An elementary collapse is the simultaneous removal from C of a pair of faces (σ,Σ), such that σ is a proper face of Σ and of no other face of C. (This is usually abbreviated as "σ is a free face of Σ"; some complexes have no free faces.) We say the complex C collapses onto the complex D, and write [formula], if C can be deformed onto D by a finite (nonempty) sequence of elementary collapses. Without loss of generality, we may assume that in this sequence the pairs ((d - 1),  d) are removed first; we may also assume that after that, the pairs ((d - 2),  (d - 1)) are removed; and so on. A collapsible d-complex is a d-complex that can be collapsed onto a single vertex. If C collapses onto D, then D is a strong deformation retract of C, so C and D have the same homotopy type. In particular, all collapsible complexes are contractible.

The underlying space |C| of a d-complex C is the union of all of its faces. A d-sphere is a d-complex whose underlying space is homeomorphic to [formula]. A d-ball is a d-complex with underlying space homeomorphic to [formula]; a tree of d-polytopes is a d-ball whose dual graph is a tree. With abuse of language, by d-manifold we will mean any d-complex whose underlying space is homeomorphic to a compact connected topological manifold (without boundary).

A locally constructible (LC) d-manifold is a d-manifold obtained from a tree of polytopes by repeatedly identifying a pair of adjacent (d - 1)-faces of the boundary. ("Adjacent" means here "sharing at least a (d - 2)-face" and represents a dynamic requirement: after each identification, new pairs of boundary facets might become adjacent and may be glued together.) Equivalently [\cite=BZ], an LC d-manifold is a d-manifold that after the removal of a facet collapses onto a (d - 2)-dimensional subcomplex. For the definition of shellability or constructibility, see e.g. Björner [\cite=BJOE].

Proof of the main results

In this section, we exploit the characterization of LC manifolds mentioned in the Introduction to prove Main Theorems [\ref=mainthm:1] and [\ref=mainthm:2]. In fact:

Let us start with a classical result on collapses and products:

Let A and B be two polytopal complexes. If A collapses onto a complex CA then A  ×  B collapses onto CA  ×  B.

Let [formula] be an ordered list of all the faces of B, ordered by weakly decreasing dimension. Let (σA1,ΣA1) be the first pair of faces appearing in the collapse of A onto CA. We perform the M collapses (σA1  ×  B1,ΣA1  ×  B1), [formula], (σA1  ×  BM,ΣA1  ×  BM), in this order. It is easy to check that each of the steps above is a legitimate collapse: When we remove σA1  ×  Bi all the faces of the type σA1  ×  β containing σA1  ×  Bi have already been removed, because in the list [formula] the face β appears before Bi. On the other hand, σA1 is a free face of ΣA1, thus no face of the type α  ×  Bi may contain σA1  ×  Bi other than ΣA1  ×  Bi.

Next, we consider the second pair of faces (σA2,ΣA2) that appears in the collapse of A onto CA and we repeat the procedure above, and so on: In the end, the only faces left are those of CA  ×  B.

If A is collapsible, then A  ×  B collapses onto a copy of B.

Since the product of the dunce hat with a segment [formula] is collapsible [\cite=ZeemanDunceHat], the collapsibility of both A and B strictly implies the collapsibility of A  ×  B.

Now, consider a 1-sphere S consisting of four edges. The 2-complex S  ×  S is a cubical torus; after the removal of a facet, it collapses onto the union of a meridian and a longitude of the torus. (Topologically, a punctured torus retracts to a bouquet of two circles.) This can be generalized as follows:

Let A and B be two polytopal complexes. Let ΔA (resp. ΔB) be a facet of A (resp. B). If A  -  ΔA collapses onto some complex CA and if B  -  ΔB collapses onto some complex CB then (A  ×  B)  -  (ΔA  ×  ΔB) collapses onto [formula].

We start by forming three ordered lists of pairs of faces. Let [formula], [formula], [formula] be the list of the removed pairs of faces in the collapse of A  -  ΔA onto CA. (We assume that higher dimensional faces are collapsed first.) Analogously, let [formula], [formula], [formula] be the list of all the removed pairs in the collapse of B  -  ΔB onto CB. Let then [formula] be the list of all the faces of B that are not in CB, ordered by weakly decreasing dimension.

The desired collapsing sequence for (A  ×  B)  -  (ΔA  ×  ΔB) consists of U + 1 distinct phases:

Eventually, the only faces of A  ×  B left are the polytopes of [formula].

Given s polytopal complexes [formula], suppose that each Ai after the removal of a facet collapses onto some lower-dimensional complex Ci  . Then the complex [formula] after the removal of a facet collapses onto

[formula]

In particular, if dim Ci  =   dim Ai  -  2 for each i  , then [formula] minus a facet collapses onto a complex of dimension [formula].

It follows from Proposition [\ref=prop:uffa], by induction on s.

Proposition [\ref=prop:collapseproduct0], Proposition [\ref=prop:uffa] and Corollary [\ref=cor:collapseproduct] can be easily extended to the generality of finite regular CW complexes (see e.g. Björner [\cite=BJOE] for the definition).

Let C be the boundary of the three-dimensional cube [formula]; removing a square from C one obtains a collapsible 2-complex. The product C  ×  C is a cubical 4-manifold homeomorphic to S2  ×  S2 (and not homeomorphic to S4). The 4-complex obtained by removing a facet from C  ×  C collapses onto a 2-complex, by Proposition [\ref=prop:uffa]. Therefore, C  ×  C is LC. Note that the second homotopy group of C  ×  C is nonzero. However, as observed by Durhuus and Jonsson [\cite=DJ] [\cite=Benedetti-diss], every LC d-manifold is simply connected.

The previous example can be generalized by taking the product of the boundary of the 3-cube [formula] with the boundary of the (d - 1)-cube [formula] (d  ≥  4). As a result, one obtains a cubical d-manifold that is homeomorphic to S2  ×  Sd - 2 (and not homeomorphic to Sd). This d-manifold is LC, because the boundary of a (d - 1)-cube is shellable and LC. In contrast, no manifold homeomorphic to S1  ×  Sd - 1 is LC, because LC manifolds are simply connected.
