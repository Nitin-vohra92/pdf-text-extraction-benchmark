(σ,τ)-amenability of C*-algebras

Introduction and preliminaries

The notion of an amenable Banach algebra was introduced by B.E.  Johnson in his definitive monograph [\cite=J1]. This class of Banach algebras arises naturally out of the cohomology theory for Banach algebras, the algebraic version of which was developed by G. Hochschild [\cite=H1]. For a comprehensive account on amenability the reader is referred to books [\cite=DAL] [\cite=RUN].

Suppose that A is an algebra, σ,τ:A  →  A are two linear mappings such that both σ(A) and τ(A) are subalgebras of A and X is a [formula]-bimodule. A linear mapping D:A  →  X is called a (σ,τ)-derivation if

[formula]

We say that a (σ,τ)-derivation D is a (σ,τ)-inner derivation if it is of the form either D-x(a) = x  ·  σ(a) - τ(a)  ·  x    (a∈A) or D+x(a) = x  ·  σ(a) + τ(a)  ·  x    (a∈A) for some x∈X. For other approaches to generalized derivations and their applications see [\cite=B-M] [\cite=BRE] [\cite=B-V] [\cite=M-M4] and references therein. In particular, the automatic continuity problem for (σ,τ)-derivations is considered in [\cite=M-M1] [\cite=M-M2] [\cite=M-M3] and an achievement of continuity of (σ,τ)-derivations without linearity is given in [\cite=H-J-M-M].

A wide range of examples are as follows (see [\cite=M-M2]):

Every ordinary derivation is an idA-derivation, where idA is the identity map on the algebra A.

Every endomorphism α on A is an [formula]-derivation on A.

A θ-derivation is nothing than a point derivation [formula] at the character θ.

A Banach algebra A is said to be (σ,τ)-amenable (resp. (σ,τ)-contractible) if every continuous (σ,τ)-derivation from A into a dual Banach [formula]-bimodule X* (a Banach [formula]-bimodule X, resp.) is (σ,τ)-inner. Recall that the bimodule structure of the dual space Y* of a normed bimodule Y over a Banach algebra B is defined via

[formula]

If σ  =  τ we simply use the terminologies σ-derivation, σ-amenability, etc.

We establish some general algebraic properties of (σ,τ)-derivations and investigate the relation between amenability and (σ,τ)-amenability of Banach algebras. In particular, we prove that if [formula] is a C*-algebra and [formula] is a *  -homomorphism, then [formula] is σ-amenable if and only if [formula] is amenable.

For definitions and elementary properties of Banach algebras we refer the reader to [\cite=DAL] [\cite=PAL].

Algebraic Aspects of (σ,τ)-derivations

Throughout this section let A be a unital algebra with unit e, let σ,τ:A  →  A be linear mappings such that both σ(A) and τ(A) be subalgebras of A and X is a [formula]-bimodule. In the case where [formula], we assume that X is unit linked, i.e. ex = xe = e    (x∈X). In this section we first give a sufficient condition under which each (σ,τ)-derivation on A into X is of the form D+x for some x∈X. We second show how the assumption that σ and τ are homomorphisms ensures D+x = 0 for each x∈X, and provide a suitable setting for study of (σ,τ)-derivations as well. Let us start our work with the following definition.

Let x be a fixed element of X. A linear mapping φ:A  →  A is called a right (left, resp.) x-homomorphism if x  ·  (φ(ab) - φ(a)φ(b)) = 0 ( (φ(ab) - φ(a)φ(b))  ·  x = 0, resp.) for each a,b∈A.

Suppose σ(e) = λe and τ(e) = (1 - λ)e for some nonzero number λ  ≠  1. Then for each (σ,τ)-derivation D:A  →  X there is an x∈X such that

[formula]

In this case, [formula] is a right x-homomorphism and [formula] is a left x-homomorphism.

It follows from

[formula]

that

[formula]

Now if D(e) = 0 then D(a) = 0 for each a∈A. Hence we may suppose that [formula]. Thus [formula]. A similar argument shows that [formula]. Now we have

[formula]

We can therefore deduce that [formula] is a left x-homomorphism. By a similar argument we see that [formula] is a right x-homomorphism.

Suppose that σ(e) = λe and τ(e) = (1 - λ)e for some nonzero number λ  ≠  1. Then for each [formula]-bimodule X and each (σ,τ)-derivation D:A  →  X, there are an x∈X and two linear mappings Σ,T:A  →  A such that 2Σ is a right x-homomorphism, 2T is a left x-homomorphism, D is a (Σ,T)-derivation and

[formula]

Put [formula] and [formula].

Thus we have

Let A be a unital algebra with unit e. Suppose that σ,τ:A  →  A are linear mappings such that both σ(A) and τ(A) are subalgebras of A and that σ(e) = λe and τ(e) = (1 - λ)e for some nonzero number λ  ≠  1. Then every (σ,τ)-derivation is (σ,τ)-inner.

Let x be a fixed element of X. Then D-x(a) = x  ·  σ(a) - τ(a)  ·  x is a (σ,τ)-derivation if and only if

[formula]

for all a,b∈A.

D-x is a (σ,τ)-derivation if and only if

[formula]

or equivalently

[formula]

Let Xσ(A): = {xσ(a):x∈X,a∈A}  =  {0} (resp. τ(A)X  =  {0}) and aX  =  {0} (resp. Xa = {0}) implies that a = 0. If all mappings D-x are (σ,τ)-derivation, then Proposition [\ref=Madjid] implies that σ (resp. τ) is necessarily a homomorphism. This pathological observation and the following proposition let us reasonably assume that σ and τ are unital homomorphisms when we deal with (σ,τ)-amenability (or (σ,τ)-contractibility).

Let σ,τ:A  →  A be two unital homomorphisms. Then D+x:A  →  X defined by D+x(a) = x  ·  σ(a) + τ(a)  ·  x is a (σ,τ)-derivation if and only if D+x = 0.

We have

[formula]

Thus τ(a)  ·  x  ·  σ(b) = 0 for all a,b∈A. putting a = e we have x  ·  σ(b) = 0 and putting b = e we have τ(a)  ·  x = 0. Thus D+x(a) = x  ·  σ(a) + τ(a)  ·  x = 0.

σ-amenability of C*-algebras

Throughout this section, let A be a Banach algebra, let σ,τ:A  →  A be homomorphisms and let X be a Banach [formula]-bimodule. We also assume that all mappings under consideration are linear and continuous. In this section we study some interrelations between (σ,τ)-amenability and ordinary amenability. Let us start our works with the following easy observation.

If A is amenable (contractible), then A is (σ,τ)-amenable ((σ,τ)-contractible) for every two homomorphisms σ and τ.

We only prove the statement concerning amenability. The other case can be similarly proved. Let X be a Banach [formula]-bimodule and D:A  →  X *  be a (σ,τ)-derivation. One can regard X as a Banach A-bimodule via

[formula]

Then D(ab) = D(a)σ(b) + τ(a)D(b) = D(a)  ·  b + τ(a)  ·  D(b). Therefore D is a derivation, and so, by amenability of A, there exists f∈X* such that D(a) = f  ·  a - a  ·  f = fσ(a) - τ(a)f.

An interesting question is whether we can have a similar result but in contrary to Proposition [\ref=cor1].

Let A be a non amenable Banach algebra, let [formula] be its unitization and σ:  →   be defined by [formula] for all [formula] and a∈A. Then [formula] is not amenable (see [\cite=RUN]) but is σ-amenable. To prove the σ-amenability of [formula] let X be a Banach space and D:  →  X be a σ-derivation. Define [formula] by [formula]. Then d is an ordinary derivation on [formula], which is 0. Thus [formula]. Now we have

[formula]

Putting z = w = 0 and b = 1 we get [formula]. Thus [formula] for all [formula] and a∈A.

Correspondence Between (σ,τ)-Derivations and Derivations on C*-Algebras

In this section we fix a C*-algebra [formula] and a Banach [formula]-bimodule X and give a correspondence between (σ,τ)-derivations on [formula] and ordinary derivations on a certain algebra related to [formula]. To state the result, we give some terminology.

Let [formula] be two *  -homomorphisms. The mapping [formula] defined by [formula] is a *  -homomorphism, where [formula] denotes the C*-direct sum. Hence [formula] is a C*-algebra which is isometrically isomorphic to [formula]. If X is a Banach [formula]-bimodule, then X can be regarded as an [formula]-bimodule via the operations

[formula]

Then to each linear mapping [formula] there corresponds a linear mapping [formula] by d(σ(a),τ(a)) = D(a) in such a way that D is a (σ,τ)-derivation if and only if d is an ordinary derivation. Now we are in the situation to present the results of this section.

Each (σ,τ)-derivation [formula] is (σ,τ)-inner if and only each derivation [formula] is inner.

Let each (σ,τ)-derivation from [formula] to X be (σ,τ)-inner. Suppose that [formula] is a derivation. Then as mentioned above D(a) = d(σ(a),τ(a)) is a derivation from [formula] to X. Hence there exists an x∈X such that D(a) = x  ·  σ(a) - τ(a)  ·  x for all [formula]. This implies that

[formula]

for all [formula]. Therefore d is inner.

Conversely, let each derivation from [formula] to X be inner. Suppose that [formula] is a (σ,τ)-derivation. Then again as above d(σ(a),τ(a)) = D(a) is a derivation from [formula] to X. So there is an x∈X such that d(u) = x  ·  u - u  ·  x for all [formula], or equivalently D(a) = d(σ(a),τ(a)) = x  ·  σ(a) - τ(a)  ·  x. Thus D is (σ,τ)-inner.

Let [formula] be a C*-algebra, [formula] be a *  -homomorphism and X be a Banach σ(A)-bimodule. Then each σ-derivation [formula] is σ-inner if and only each derivation [formula] is inner.

Use the fact that [formula].

Under some restrictions on σ and τ we mention our last result concerning (σ,τ)-amenability of [formula].

Let [formula] be a C*-algebra and let [formula] be two *  -homomorphisms with ker (σ) =  ker (τ). Then [formula] is (σ,τ)-amenable ((σ,τ)-contractible, resp.) if and only if [formula] is amenable (contractible, resp.).

Since ker (σ) =  ker (τ) the relations

[formula]

ensure us to say that X is a Banach [formula]-bimodule if and only if it is a [formula]-bimodule. Thus the correspondence between (σ,τ)-derivations on [formula] and derivations on [formula] helps us to complete the proof. Note that in this case [formula] is

[formula]

The following corollary includes a converse to Proposition [\ref=cor1] in the framework of C*-algebras. The general case where A is an arbitrary Banach algebra remains open.

Let [formula] be a C*-algebra and let [formula] be a *  -homomorphism. Then [formula] is σ-amenable (σ-contractible, resp.) if and only if [formula] is amenable (contractible, resp.).

If σ is not homomorphism, then the above result is not true in general. To see this, let [formula] be an amenable C*-algebra and [formula], where [formula] is the identity mapping on [formula]. Note that [formula]. Let X be a symmetric [formula]-bimodule and define [formula] by D(a) = f  ·  a, where f is a fixed element of X*. Then D is a σ-derivation, since

[formula]

But D is not inner. In contrary, suppose that D(a) = g  ·  σ(a) - σ(a)  ·  g for some fixed element g of X*. Since X is symmetric, we have D = 0 which contradicts to the definition of D. Thus [formula] is not σ-amenable.
