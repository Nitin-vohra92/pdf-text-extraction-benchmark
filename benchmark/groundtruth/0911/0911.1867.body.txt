Wave-front sets of Banach function types

Introduction

In this paper we introduce wave-front sets with respect to Fourier images of translation invariant BF-spaces. The family of such wave-front sets contains the wave-front sets of Sobolev type, introduced by Hörmander in [\cite=Hrm-nonlin], the classical wave-front sets (cf. Sections 8.1 and 8.2 in [\cite=Ho1]), and wave-front sets of Fourier Lebesgue types, introduced in [\cite=PTT1]. Roughly speaking, for any given distribution f and for appropriate Banach (or Frechét) space B of tempered distributions, the wave-front set [formula] of f consists of all pairs (x0,ξ0) in [formula] such that no localizations of the distribution at x0 belongs to B in the direction ξ0.

We also establish mapping properties for a quite general class of pseudo-differential operators on such wave-front sets, and show that the micro-local analysis in [\cite=PTT1] in background of Fourier Lebesgue spaces can be further generalized. It follows that our approach gives rise to flexible micro-local analysis tools which fit well to the most common approach developed in e.g. [\cite=Ho1] [\cite=Hrm-nonlin]. In particular, we prove that usual mapping properties, which are valid for classical wave-front sets (cf. Chapters VIII and XVIII in [\cite=Ho1]), also hold for wave-front sets of Fourier Banach types. For example, we show

[formula]

That is, any operator [formula] shrinks the wave-front sets and opposite embeddings can be obtained by including [formula], the set of characteristic points of the operator symbol a.

The symbol classes for the pseudo-differential operators are denoted by [formula], the set of all smooth functions a on [formula] such that [formula]. Here [formula] and ω0 is an appropriate smooth function on [formula]. We note that [formula] agrees with the Hörmander class [formula] when ω0(x,ξ) = 〈〉ξr, where [formula] and 〈〉ξ = (1 + |ξ|2)1 / 2.

The set of characteristic points [formula] of a∈S(ω)ρ,δ is the same as in [\cite=PTT1], and depends on the choices of ρ, δ and ω (see Definition [\ref=defchar] and Proposition [\ref=psiecharequiv]). We recall that this set is smaller than the set of characteristic points given by [\cite=Ho1]. It is empty when a satisfies a local ellipticity condition with respect to ω, which is fulfilled for any hypoelliptic partial differential operator with constant coefficients (cf. [\cite=PTT1]). As a consequence of [\eqref=eq:inclusions], it follows that such hypoelliptic operators preserve the wave-front sets, as expected (cf. Example 3.9 in [\cite=PTT1]).

Information on regularity in background of wave-front sets of Fourier Banach types might be more detailed compared to classical wave-front sets, because of our choices of different weight functions ω and Banach spaces when defining our Fourier Banach space [formula]. For example, the space [formula], with ω(x,ξ) = 〈〉ξN for some integer N  ≥  0, is locally close to [formula] (cf. the Introduction of [\cite=PTT1]). Consequently, the wave-front set with respect to [formula] can be used to investigate a sort of regularity which is close to smoothness of order N.

Furthermore, we are able to apply our results on pseudo-differential operators in context of modulation space theory, when discussing mapping properties of pseudo-differential operators with respect to wave-front sets. The modulation spaces were introduced by Feichtinger in [\cite=F1], and the theory was developed in [\cite=Feichtinger3] [\cite=Feichtinger4] [\cite=Feichtinger5] [\cite=Grochenig0a]. The modulation space [formula], where ω is a weight function (or time-frequency shift) on phase space [formula], appears as the set of temperated (ultra-)distributions whose short-time Fourier transform belong to the weighted Banach space [formula]. These types of modulation spaces contains the (classical) modulation spaces [formula] as well as the space [formula] related to the Wiener amalgam spaces, by choosing [formula] and [formula] respectively (see Remark [\ref=Modamalgam]). In the last part of the paper we define wave-front sets with respect to weighted modulation spaces, and prove that they coincide with the wave-front sets of Fourier Banach types.

Parallel to this development, modulation spaces have been incorporated into the calculus of pseudo-differential operators, in the sense of the study of continuity of (classical) pseudo-differential operators acting on modulation spaces (cf. [\cite=Tachizawa1] [\cite=Czaja] [\cite=Pilipovic2] [\cite=Pilipovic3] [\cite=Teofanov1] [\cite=Teofanov2]), and the study of operators of non-classical type, where modulation spaces are used as symbol classes. We refer to [\cite=Gro-book] [\cite=Grochenig2] [\cite=Grochenig0] [\cite=Grochenig1b] [\cite=Grochenig1c] [\cite=Herau1] [\cite=HTW] [\cite=Pilipovic2] [\cite=Sjostrand1] [\cite=Sjostrand2] [\cite=Toft2] [\cite=Toft35] [\cite=To8] [\cite=Toft4] for more facts about pseudo-differential operators in background of modulation space theory.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=sec1] we recall the definition and basic properties for pseudo-differential operators, translation invariant Banach function spaces (BF-spaces) and (weighted) Fourier Banach spaces. Here we also define sets of characteristic points for a broad class of pseudo-differential operators. In Section [\ref=sec2] we prove some properties for the sets of characteristic points, which shows that our definition coincide with the sets of characteristic points defined in [\cite=PTT1]. These sets might be smaller than characteristic sets in [\cite=Ho1] (cf. [\cite=PTT1]).

In Section [\ref=sec3] we define wave-front sets with respect to (weighted) Fourier Banach spaces, and prove some of their main properties. Thereafter, in Section [\ref=sec4] we show how these wave-front sets are propagated under the action of pseudo-differential operators. In particular, we prove [\eqref=eq:inclusions], when ω0 and ω are appropriate weights and a belongs to S(ω0)ρ,0 with ρ > 0.

In Section [\ref=sec5] we consider wave-front sets obtained from sequences of Fourier Banach spaces. These types of wave-front sets contain the classical ones (with respect to smoothness), and the mapping properties for pseudo-differential operators also hold in this context (cf. Section 18.1 in [\cite=Ho1]).

Finally, Section [\ref=sec6] is devoted to study the definition and basic properties of wave-front sets with respect to modulation spaces. We prove that they can be identified with certain wave-front sets of Fourier Banach types.

Preliminaries

In this section we recall some notation and basic results. The proofs are in general omitted. In what follows we let Γ denote an open cone in [formula]. If [formula] is fixed, then an open cone which contains ξ is sometimes denoted by Γξ.

Assume that [formula] are positive functions. Then ω is called v-moderate if

[formula]

for some constant C which is independent of [formula]. If v in [\eqref=moderate] can be chosen as a polynomial, then ω is called polynomially moderate. We let [formula] be the set of all polynomially moderated functions on [formula]. We say that v is submultiplicative when [\eqref=moderate] holds with ω = v. Throughout we assume that the submultiplicative weights are even. If [formula] is constant with respect to the x-variable (ξ-variable), then we sometimes write ω(ξ) (ω(x)) instead of ω(x,ξ). In this case we consider ω as an element in [formula] or in [formula] depending on the situation.

We also need to consider classes of weight functions, related to [formula]. More precisely, we let [formula] be the set of all [formula] such that ∂αω  /  ω∈L∞ for all multi-indices α. For each [formula], there is an equivalent weight [formula], that is, C- 1ω0  ≤  ω  ≤  Cω0 holds for some constant C (cf. [\cite=To8]).

Assume that [formula]. Then we let [formula] be the set of all ω(x,ξ) in [formula] such that

[formula]

for every multi-indices α and β. Note that in contrast to [formula], we do not have an equivalence between [formula] and [formula] when ρ > 0. On the other hand, if [formula] and ρ∈[0,1], then [formula] contains ω(x,ξ) = 〈〉ξs, which are one of the most important classes in the applications.

For any weight ω in [formula] or in [formula], we let [formula] be the set of all [formula] such that [formula].

The Fourier transform [formula] is the linear and continuous mapping on [formula] which takes the form

[formula]

when [formula]. We recall that [formula] is a homeomorphism on [formula] which restricts to a homeomorphism on [formula] and to a unitary operator on [formula].

Next we recall the definition of Banach function spaces.

Assume that [formula] is a Banach space of complex-valued measurable functions on [formula] and that [formula] is submultiplicative. Then [formula] is called a (translation) invariant BF-space on [formula] (with respect to v), if there is a constant C such that the following conditions are fulfilled:

[formula] (continuous embeddings);

if [formula] and [formula], then [formula], and

[formula]

if [formula] satisfy [formula] and |f|  ≤  |g| almost everywhere, then [formula] and

[formula]

Assume that [formula] is a translation invariant BF-space. If [formula] and h∈L∞, then it follows from (3) in Definition [\ref=BFspaces] that [formula] and

[formula]

Assume that [formula] are such v and v0 are submultiplicative, ω0 is v0-moderate, and assume that [formula] is a translation-invariant BF-space on [formula] with respect to v. Also let [formula] be the Banach space which consists of all [formula] such that [formula] is finite. Then [formula] is a translation invariant BF-space with respect to v0v.

Let [formula] be an invariant BF-space. Then it is easy to find Sobolev type spaces which are continuously embedded in [formula]. In fact, for each p∈[1,   ∞   ] and integer N  ≥  0, let [formula] be the set of all [formula] such that [formula], where

[formula]

Then for each p fixed, the topology for [formula] can be defined by the semi-norms [formula], for [formula].

A combination of this fact and (1) and (3) in Definition [\ref=BFspaces] now shows that for each p∈[1,   ∞   ] and each translation invariant BF-space [formula], there is an integer N  ≥  0 such that [formula]. Moreover, let [formula] be the set of all [formula] such that f  〈〉    ·    N∈L∞. Then, since any element in L∞N can be majorized with an element in Q∞N, it follows from (3) in Definition [\ref=BFspaces] that [formula], provided N is chosen large enough. This proves the assertion.

For future references we note that if [formula] is a translation invariant BF-space with respect to the submultiplicative weight v on [formula], then the convolution map *   on [formula] extends uniquely to a continuous mapping from [formula], and for some constant C it holds

[formula]

In fact, if [formula] and g is a step function, then f * g is well-defined and belongs to [formula] in view of the definitions, and Minkowski's inequality gives

[formula]

Now assume that g∈C∞0. Then f * g is well-defined as an element in [formula], and by approximating g with step functions and using [\eqref=propupps] it follows that [formula] and that [\eqref=propupps] holds also in this case. The assertion now follows from this fact and a simple argument of approximations, using the fact that C∞0 is dense in L1(v).

For each translation invariant BF-space [formula] on [formula], and each pair of vector spaces (V1,V2) such that [formula], we define the projection spaces [formula] and [formula] of [formula] by the formulae

Let [formula] be a translation invariant BF-space on [formula], and let [formula] and [formula] be the same as in [\eqref=B1def] and [\eqref=B2def]. Then

In particular, if [formula] for j = 1,2 are fixed and [formula] and [formula], then [formula] and [formula] are translation invariant BF-spaces under the norms

[formula]

respectively.

We only prove [\eqref=B2def]'. The other equality follows by similar arguments and is left for the reader. We may assume that [formula] with d1 + d2 = d.

Let [formula] be the right-hand side of [\eqref=B2def]'. Then it is obvious that [formula]. We have to prove the opposite inclusion.

Therefore, assume that [formula], and choose [formula] such that [formula]. Also let [formula] be arbitrary. We shall prove that [formula].

Let [formula] be an open ball and c > 0 be chosen such that |φ0(x)| > c when x∈Q. Also let the lattice [formula] and φ1∈C∞0(Q) be such that 0  ≤  φ1  ≤  1 and

[formula]

Then φ1  ≤  C|φ0|, for some constant C > 0, which gives

[formula]

This in turn gives

[formula]

Since [formula] and [formula], it follows that the sum in the right-hand side of [\eqref=chi0est1] is finite. Hence [formula], and the proof is complete.

We note that the last sum in [\eqref=chi0est1] is the norm

[formula]

for the weighted Wiener space

[formula]

(cf. [\cite=Gro-book]). The results in Proposition [\ref=propbnoll] can therefore be improved in such way that we may replace [formula] by W(v) in [\eqref=B1def], [\eqref=B2def], [\eqref=B1def]' and [\eqref=B2def]'.

Assume that [formula] is a translation invariant BF-space on [formula], and that [formula]. Then we let [formula] be the set of all [formula] such that ξ  ↦  (ξ)ω(x,ξ) belongs to [formula]. It follows that [formula] is a Banach space under the norm

[formula]

In many situations it is convenient to permit an x dependency for the weight ω in the definition of Fourier Banach spaces. More precisely, for each [formula] and each translation invariant BF-space [formula] on [formula], we let [formula] be the set of all [formula] such that

[formula]

is finite. Since ω is v-moderate for some [formula] it follows that different choices of x give rise to equivalent norms. Therefore the condition [formula] is independent of x, and it follows that [formula] is independent of x although [formula] might depend on x.

Recall that a topological vector space [formula] is called local if V  ⊆  Vloc. Here [formula] is open, and Vloc consists of all [formula] such that φf∈V for every φ∈C∞0(X). For future references we note that if [formula] is a translation invariant BF-space on [formula] and [formula], then it follows from [\eqref=propupps] that [formula] is a local space, i. e.

[formula]

We need to recall some facts from Chapter XVIII in [\cite=Ho1] concerning pseudo-differential operators. Let [formula], and [formula] be fixed. Then the pseudo-differential operator [formula] is the linear and continuous operator on [formula], defined by the formula

[formula]

For general [formula], the pseudo-differential operator [formula] is defined as the continuous operator from [formula] to [formula] with distribution kernel

[formula]

Here [formula] is the partial Fourier transform of [formula] with respect to the y-variable. This definition makes sense, since the mappings [formula] and

[formula]

are homeomorphisms on [formula]. We also note that the latter definition of [formula] agrees with the operator in [\eqref=e0.5] when [formula]. If t = 0, then [formula] agrees with the Kohn-Nirenberg representation [formula].

If [formula] and [formula], then there is a unique [formula] such that [formula]. By straight-forward applications of Fourier's inversion formula, it follows that

[formula]

(Cf. Section 18.5 in [\cite=Ho1].)

Next we discuss symbol classes which we use. Let [formula] be fixed. Then we recall from [\cite=Ho1] that [formula] is the set of all [formula] such that for each pairs of multi-indices α and β, there is a constant Cα,β such that

[formula]

Usually we assume that 0  ≤  δ  ≤  ρ  ≤  1, 0 < ρ and δ < 1.

More generally, assume that [formula]. Then we recall from the introduction that [formula] consists of all [formula] such that

[formula]

We note that [formula], when g = gρ,δ is the Riemannian metric on [formula], defined by the formula

[formula]

(cf. Section 18.4-18.6 in [\cite=Ho1]). Furthermore, S(ω)ρ,δ = Srρ,δ when ω(x,ξ) = 〈〉ξr, as remarked in the introduction.

The following result shows that pseudo-differential operators with symbols in S(ω)ρ,δ behave well. We refer to [\cite=Ho1] or [\cite=PTT1] for the proof.

Let ρ,δ∈[0,1] be such that 0  ≤  δ  ≤  ρ  ≤  1 and δ < 1, and let [formula]. If [formula], then [formula] is continuous on [formula] and extends uniquely to a continuous operator on [formula].

We also need to define the set of characteristic points of a symbol [formula], when [formula] and 0  ≤  δ  <  ρ  ≤  1. In Section [\ref=sec2] we show that this definition is equivalent to Definition 1.3 in [\cite=PTT1]. We remark that our sets of characteristic points are smaller than the corresponding sets in [\cite=Ho1]. (Cf. [\cite=Ho1] and Remark [\ref=compchar] in Section [\ref=sec2]).

Assume that 0  ≤  δ  <  ρ  ≤  1, [formula] and [formula]. Then a is called ψ-invertible with respect to ω0 at the point [formula], if there exist a neighbourhood X of x0, an open conical neighbourhood Γ of ξ0 and positive constants R and C such that

[formula]

for x∈X, ξ∈Γ and |ξ|  ≥  R.

The point (x0,ξ0) is called characteristic for a with respect to ω0 if a is not ψ-invertible with respect to ω0 at (x0,ξ0). The set of characteristic points (the characteristic set), for a with respect to ω0 is denoted [formula].

We note that [formula] means that a is elliptic near x0 in the direction ξ0. Since the case ω0 = 1 in Definition [\ref=defchar] is especially important we also make the following definition. We say that [formula] is ψ-invertible at [formula], if [formula] with ω0 = 1. That is, there exist a neighbourhood X of x0, an open conical neighbourhood Γ of ξ0 and R > 0 such that [\eqref=nydef] holds for a = c and ω0 = 1, for some constant C > 0 which is independent of x∈X and ξ∈Γ such that |ξ|  ≥  R.

It will also be convenient to have the following definition of different types of cutoff functions.

Let [formula] be open, [formula] be an open cone, x0∈X and let ξ0∈Γ.

A smooth function φ on [formula] is called a cutoff function with respect to x0 and X, if 0  ≤  φ  ≤  1, φ∈C∞0(X) and φ = 1 in an open neighbourhood of x0. The set of cutoff functions with respect to x0 and X is denoted by [formula];

A smooth function ψ on [formula] is called a directional cutoff function with respect to ξ0 and Γ, if there is a constant R > 0 and open conical neighbourhood Γ1 of ξ0 such that the following is true:

0  ≤  ψ  ≤  1 and [formula];

ψ(tξ) = ψ(ξ) when t  ≥  1 and |ξ|  ≥  R;

ψ(ξ) = 1 when ξ∈Γ1 and |ξ|  ≥  R.

The set of directional cutoff functions with respect to ξ0 and Γ is denoted by [formula].

We note that if [formula] and [formula] for some [formula], then [formula] belongs to [formula] and is ψ-invertible at (x0,ξ0).

Pseudo-differential calculus with symbols in S(ω)ρ,δ

In this section we make a review of basic results for pseudo-differential operators with symbols in classes of the form [formula], when 0  ≤  δ  <  ρ  ≤  1 and [formula]. For the standard properties in the pseudo-differential calculus we only state the results and refer to [\cite=Ho1] for the proofs. Though there are similar stated and proved properties concerning sets of characteristic points, we include proofs of these properties in order to being more self-contained.

We start with the following result concerning compositions and invariance properties for pseudo-differential operators. Here we let

[formula]

where 〈〉ξ = (1 + |ξ|2)1 / 2 as usual. We also recall that S-    ∞  ρ,δ = S-    ∞  1,0 consists of all [formula] such that for each [formula] and multi-index α, there is a constant CN,α such that

[formula]

Let 0  ≤  δ  <  ρ  ≤  1, μ  =  ρ  -  δ > 0 and [formula]. Also let {mj}∞j = 0 be a sequence of real numbers such that mj  →    -    ∞   as j  →    ∞  . Then the following is true:

if [formula] and [formula], then [formula], for some [formula]. Furthermore,

[formula]

for every [formula];

if M =  sup k  ≥  0(mk), Mj  =   sup k  ≥  j(mk) and [formula], then it exists [formula] such that

[formula]

for every N  ≥  0;

if [formula] and [formula] are such that [formula], then [formula], if and only if [formula], and

[formula]

for every N  ≥  0.

As usual we write

[formula]

when [\eqref=asymptexp] is fulfilled for every N  ≥  0. In particular it follows from [\eqref=symbcomp] and [\eqref=pseudorel2] that

[formula]

when [formula], and

[formula]

when [formula].

In the following proposition we show that the set of characteristic points for a pseudo-differential operator is independent of the choice of pseudo-differential calculus.

Assume that [formula], 0  ≤  δ  <  ρ  ≤  1, [formula] and that [formula] satisfy [formula]. Then

[formula]

Let μ and σs be the same as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=pseudocomp]. By Proposition [\ref=pseudocomp] (3) we have

[formula]

for some h∈S(ω0σ-  μ)ρ,δ.

Assume that [formula]. By the definitions, there is a negihbourhood X of x0, an open conical negihbourhood Γ of ξ0, C > 0 and R > 0 such that

[formula]

as x∈X, ξ∈Γ and |ξ|  ≥  R. This gives

[formula]

and it follows that [formula]. Hence [formula]. By symmetry, the opposite inclusion also holds. Hence [formula], and the proof is complete.

The following proposition shows different aspects of set of characteristic points, and is important when investigating wave-front properties for pseudo-differential operators. In particular it shows that [formula] satisfy certain invertibility properties outside the set of characteristic points for a. More precisely, outside [formula], we prove that

[formula]

for some convenient b, c and h which take the role of inverse, identity symbol and smoothing remainder respectively.

Let 0  ≤  δ  <  ρ  ≤  1, [formula], [formula], [formula], and let μ  =  ρ  -  δ. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

[formula];

there is an element c∈S0ρ,δ which is ψ-invertible at (x0,ξ0), and an element b∈S(1 / ω0)ρ,δ such that ab = c;

there is an element c∈S0ρ,δ which is ψ-invertible at (x0,ξ0), and elements h∈S-  μρ,δ and b∈S(1 / ω0)ρ,δ such that [\eqref=invexp] holds;

for each neighbourhood X of x0 and conical neighbourhood Γ of ξ0, there is an element [formula] where [formula] and [formula], and elements [formula] and b∈S(1 / ω0)ρ,δ such that [\eqref=invexp] holds. Furthermore, the supports of b and h are contained in [formula].

For the proof we note that μ in Proposition [\ref=psiecharequiv] is positive, which in turn implies that [formula] agrees with [formula].

The equivalence between (1) and (2) follows by letting b(x,ξ) = φ(x)ψ(ξ) / a(x,ξ) for some appropriate [formula] and [formula].

(4) ⇒   (3) is obvious in view of Remark [\ref=psiinvremark]. Assume that (3) holds. We shall prove that (1) holds, and since |b|  ≤  C / ω0, it suffices to prove that

[formula]

holds for some conical neighbourhood Γ of ξ0, some open neighbourhood X of x0 and some R > 0.

By Proposition [\ref=pseudocomp] (1) it follows that ab = c + h for some h∈S-  μρ,δ. By choosing R large enough and Γ sufficiently small conical neighbourhood of ξ0, it follows that c(x,ξ) = 1 and |h(x,ξ)|  ≤  1 / 2 when [\eqref=abinvcond] holds. This gives [\eqref=abinvertible], and (1) follows.

It remains to prove that (1) implies (4). Therefore assume that (1) holds, and choose an open neighbourhood X of x0, an open conical neighbourhood Γ of ξ0 and R > 0 such that [\eqref=nydef] holds when (x,ξ)∈X  ×  Γ and |ξ| > R. Also let [formula] and [formula] for j = 1,2,3 be such that φj = 1 on [formula], ψj = 1 on [formula] when j = 1,2, and ψj(ξ) = 0 when |ξ|  ≤  R. We also set [formula] when j  ≤  2 and cj = c2 when j  ≥  3.

If b1(x,ξ) = φ1(x)ψ1(ξ) / a(x,ξ)∈S(1 / ω0)ρ,δ, then the symbol of [formula] is equal to c1 mod (S-  μρ,δ). Hence

[formula]

holds for j = 1 and some h1∈S-  μρ,δ.

For j  ≥  2 we now define [formula] by the Neumann serie

[formula]

where [formula]. Then [\eqref=opcompmod] gives

[formula]

That is

[formula]

where

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=pseudocomp] (1) and asymptotic expansions it follows that

[formula]

for some [formula] which is equal to zero in [formula] and [formula]. Now let bj and rk be defined by the formulae

[formula]

Then

[formula]

and [\eqref=expan1]-[\eqref=h2tilde] give

[formula]

Since c1 = 1 and [formula] on [formula], it follows that

[formula]

Hence, [\eqref=opcompmod] follows for some hj∈S- jμρ,δ.

By choosing b0∈S(1 / ω)ρ,δ such that

[formula]

it follows that [formula], with

[formula]

The assertion (4) now follows by letting

[formula]

and using the fact that if [formula] and [formula], then [formula]. The proof is complete.

By Proposition [\ref=psiecharequiv] it follows that Definition 1.3 in [\cite=PTT1] is equivalent to Definition [\ref=defchar]. We also remark that if a is an appropriate symbol, and [formula] the set of characteristic points for a in the sense of [\cite=Ho1], then [formula]. Furthermore, strict embedding might occur, especially for symbols to hypoelliptic partial operators with constant coefficients, which are not elliptic (cf. Example 3.11 in [\cite=PTT1]).

Wave front sets with respect to Fourier Banach spaces

In this section we define wave-front sets with respect to Fourier Banach spaces, and show some basic properties.

Let [formula], [formula] be an open cone and let [formula] be a translation invariant BF-space on [formula]. For any [formula], let

[formula]

We note that [formula] for every [formula]. If [formula], then we set [formula]. Hence [formula] defines a semi-norm on [formula] which might attain the value +    ∞  . Since ω is v-moderate for some [formula], it follows that different [formula] gives rise to equivalent semi-norms. Furthermore, if [formula] and [formula], then [formula] agrees with [formula]. For simplicity we write [formula] instead of [formula] when ω = 1.

For the sake of notational convenience we set

[formula]

We let [formula] be the set of all [formula] such that |f|B(Γ)  <    ∞  , for some Γ  =  Γξ. We also let ΣB(f) be the complement of ΘB(f) in [formula]. Then ΘB(f) and ΣB(f) are open respectively closed subsets in [formula], which are independent of the choice of [formula] in [\eqref=skoff].

Let [formula] be a translation invariant BF-space on [formula], [formula], B be as in [\eqref=notconv], and let X be an open subset of [formula]. The wave-front set of [formula], [formula] with respect to B consists of all pairs (x0,ξ0) in [formula] such that ξ0∈ΣB(φf) holds for each φ∈C∞0(X) such that φ(x0)  ≠  0.

We note that [formula] in Definition [\ref=wave-frontdef] is a closed set in [formula], since it is obvious that its complement is open. We also note that if [formula] is fixed and ω0(ξ) = ω(x0,ξ), then [formula], since ΣB is independent of x0.

The following theorem shows that wave-front sets with respect to [formula] satisfy appropriate micro-local properties. It also shows that such wave-front sets decreases when the local Fourier BF-spaces increases, or when the weight ω decreases.

Let [formula] be open, [formula] be translation invariant BF-spaces, [formula], [formula] and [formula]. If [formula], then

It suffices to prove

[formula]

when [formula], [formula] and [formula], since the statement only involve local assertions. The local properties and Remark [\ref=newbfspaces] also imply that it is no restriction to assume that ω1  =  ω2  =  1.

Let ξ0∈ΘB2(f), and choose open cones Γ1 and Γ2 in [formula] such that [formula]. Since f has compact support, it follows that |(ξ)|  ≤  C〈〉ξN0 for some positive constants C and N0. The result therefore follows if we prove that for each N, there are constants CN such that

[formula]

By using the fact that ω is v-moderate for some [formula], and letting F(ξ) = |(ξ)| and ψ(ξ) = |(ξ)|, it follows that ψ turns rapidly to zero at infinity and

[formula]

for some positive constant C, where

[formula]

and χΓ2 is the characteristic function of Γ2. First we estimate J1. By (3) in Definition [\ref=BFspaces] and [\eqref=propupps], it follows for some constants [formula] that

[formula]

where Cψ  =  C5||||L1(v)  <    ∞  , since [formula] turns rapidly to zero at infinity. In the second inequality we have used the fact that [formula].

In order to estimate J2, we note that the conditions ξ∈Γ2, η∉Γ1 and the fact that [formula] imply that |ξ  -  η| > c max (|ξ|,|η|) for some constant c > 0, since this is true when 1 = |ξ|  ≥  |η|. We also note that if N1 is large enough, then [formula], because [formula] is continuously embedded in [formula]. Since ψ turns rapidly to zero at infinity, it follows that for each N0  >  d + N1 and [formula] such that N  >  N0, it holds

[formula]

for some constants C1 and C2  >  0, where [formula]. This proves [\eqref=cuttoff1], and the result follows.

Mapping properties for pseudo-differential operators on wave-front sets

In this section we establish mapping properties for pseudo-differential operators on wave-front sets of Fourier Banach types. More precisely, we prove the following result (cf. [\eqref=eq:inclusions]):

Let ρ > 0, [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula]. Also let [formula] be a translation invariant BF-space on [formula]. Then

[formula]

We shall mainly follow the proof of Theorem 3.1 in [\cite=PTT1]. The following restatement of Proposition 3.2 in [\cite=PTT1] shows that [formula] when [formula].

Let [formula], [formula], 0  ≤  δ  ≤  ρ, 0 < ρ, δ < 1, and let [formula]. Also let [formula] be a translation invariant BF-space, and let the operator La on [formula] be defined by the formula

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are such that

[formula]

Then the kernel of La belongs to [formula]. In particular, the following is true:

[formula] for some [formula];

[formula].

Next we consider properties of the wave-front set of [formula] at a fixed point when f is concentrated to that point.

Let ρ, ω, ω0, a and [formula] be as in Theorem [\ref=mainthm2]. Also let [formula]. Then the following is true:

if [formula] are open cones such that [formula], and [formula], then [formula];

[formula].

We note that [formula] in Proposition [\ref=keyprop2AA] makes sense as an element in [formula], by Proposition [\ref=p5.4].

We shall mainly follow the proof of Proposition 3.3 in [\cite=PTT1]. We may assume that ω(x,ξ) = ω(ξ), ω0(x,ξ) = ω0(ξ), and that [formula] for some compact set [formula], since the statements only involve local assertions.

Let F(ξ) = |(ξ)ω(ξ)|, and let [formula] denote the partial Fourier transform of a(x,ξ) with respect to the x variable. By straightforward computation, for arbitrary N we have

[formula]

for some constant C (cf. (3.6) and (3.8) in [\cite=PTT1]).

We have to estimate

[formula]

By [\eqref=estpseudo] we get

[formula]

where C is a constant and

[formula]

In order to estimate J1 and J2 we argue as in the proof of [\eqref=cuttoff1]. More precisely, by [\eqref=propupps] we get

[formula]

Next we estimate J2. Since [formula], we get

[formula]

for some constant c > 0. (Cf. the proof of Proposition 3.3.)

Since f has compact support, it follows that F(η)  ≤  C〈〉ηt1 for some constant C. By combining these estimates we obtain

[formula]

Hence, if we choose N sufficiently large, it follows that the right-hand side is finite. This proves (1).

The assertion (2) follows immediately from (1) and the definitions. The proof is complete.

By Proposition [\ref=pseudocomp] it is no restriction to assume that t = 0. We start to prove the first inclusion in [\eqref=wavefrontemb1]. Assume that [formula], let [formula] be such that χ = 1 in a neighborhood of x0, and set χ1 = 1 - χ and a0(x,ξ) = χ(x)a(x,ξ). Then it follows from Proposition [\ref=propmain1AA] that

[formula]

Furthermore, by Proposition [\ref=keyprop2AA] we get which implies that

[formula]

since [formula] is equal to [formula] near x0. The result is now a consequence of the inclusion

[formula]

It remains to prove the last inclusion in [\eqref=wavefrontemb1]. By Proposition [\ref=propmain1AA] it follows that it is no restriction to assume that f has compact support. Assume that

[formula]

and choose b, c and h as in Proposition [\ref=psiecharequiv] (4). We shall prove that [formula]. Since

[formula]

the result follows if we prove

[formula]

where

[formula]

We start to consider [formula]. By the first embedding in [\eqref=wavefrontemb1] it follows that

[formula]

Since we have assumed that [formula], it follows that [formula].

Next we consider [formula]. Since [formula], it follows that [formula]. Hence S3 is empty.

Finally we consider [formula]. By the assumptions it follows that c0 = 1 - c is zero in Γ, and by replacing Γ with a smaller cone, if necessary, we may assume that c0  =  0 in a conical neighborhood of Γ. Hence, if [formula], Γ2, J1 and J2 are the same as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=keyprop2AA], then it follows from that proof and the fact that c0(x,ξ)∈S0ρ,0 is compactly supported in the x-variable, that J1 <  +   ∞  , and that for each N  ≥  0, there are constants CN and CN' such that

[formula]

By choosing N large enough, it follows that

[formula]

This proves that [formula], and the proof is complete.

We note that the statements in Theorems [\ref=mainthm2] are not true if ω0 = 1 and the assumption ρ > 0 is replaced by ρ = 0. (Cf. Remark 3.7 in [\cite=PTT1].)

Next we apply Theorem [\ref=mainthm2] on operators which are elliptic with respect to [formula], where [formula]. More precisely, assume that [formula] and [formula]. Then a and [formula] are called (locally) elliptic with respect to [formula] or ω0, if for each compact set [formula], there are positive constants c and R such that

[formula]

Since |a(x,ξ)|  ≤  Cω0(x,ξ), it follows from the definitions that for each multi-index α, there are constants Cα,β such that when a is elliptic. (See e. g. [\cite=Ho1] [\cite=BBR].)

It immediately follows from the definitions that [formula] when a is elliptic with respect to ω0. The following result is now an immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=mainthm2].

Let [formula], [formula], ρ > 0, and let [formula] be elliptic with respect to ω0. Also let [formula] be a translation invariant BF-space. If [formula], then

[formula]

Wave-front sets of sup and inf types and pseudo-differential operators

In this section we put the micro-local analysis in a more general context compared to previous sections, and define wave-front sets with respect to sequences of Fourier BF-spaces.

Let [formula] and [formula] be translation invariant BF-space on [formula] when j belongs to some index set J, and consider the array of spaces, given by

[formula]

If [formula], and (Bj) is given by [\eqref=notconvsequences], then we let Θsup(Bj)(f) be the set of all [formula] such that for some Γ  =  Γξ and each j∈J it holds |f|Bj(Γ)  <    ∞  . We also let Θinf(Bj)(f) be the set of all [formula] such that for some Γ  =  Γξ and some j∈J it holds |f|Bj(Γ)  <    ∞  . Finally we let Σsup(Bj)(f) and Σinf(Bj)(f) be the complements in [formula] of Θsup(Bj)(f) and Θinf(Bj)(f) respectively.

Let J be an index set, [formula] be translation invariant BF-space on [formula], [formula] when j∈J, (Bj) be as in [\eqref=notconvsequences], and let X be an open subset of [formula].

The wave-front set of [formula], [formula], of sup-type with respect to (Bj), consists of all pairs (x0,ξ0) in [formula] such that ξ0∈Σsup(Bj)(φf) holds for each φ∈C∞0(X) such that φ(x0)  ≠  0;

The wave-front set of [formula], [formula], of inf-type with respect to (Bj), consists of all pairs (x0,ξ0) in [formula] such that ξ0∈Σinf(Bj)(φf) holds for each φ∈C∞0(X) such that φ(x0)  ≠  0.

Let ωj(x,ξ)  =  〈〉ξ- j for [formula] and [formula], where qj∈[1,   ∞   ]. Then it follows that [formula] in Definition [\ref=defsuperposWF] is equal to the standard wave front set [formula] in Chapter VIII in [\cite=Ho1].

The following result follows immediately from Theorem [\ref=mainthm2] and its proof. We omit the details.

The following generalization of Theorem [\ref=hypoellthm] is an immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=mainthm2]', since [formula], when a is elliptic with respect to ω0.

We note that many properties valid for the wave-front sets of Fourier Banach type also hold for wave-front sets in the present section. For example, the conclusions in Remark [\ref=rho0] hold for wave-front sets of sup- and inf-types.

Finally we remark that there are some technical generalizations of Theorem [\ref=mainthm2] which involve pseudo-differential operators with symbols in [formula] with 0  ≤  δ  <  ρ  ≤  1. From these generalizations it follows that

[formula]

when 0  ≤  δ  <  ρ  ≤  1, [formula], [formula] and [formula]. (Cf. Theorem 5.3' and Theorem 5.5 in [\cite=PTT1].)

Wave front sets with respect to modulation spaces

In this section we define wave-front sets with respect to modulation spaces, and show that they coincide with wave-front sets of Fourier Banach types. In particular, all micro-local properties for pseudo-differential operators in the previous sections carry over to wave-front sets of modulation space types.

We start with defining general types of modulation spaces. Let (the window) [formula] be fixed, and let [formula]. Then the short-time Fourier transform Vφf is the element in [formula], defined by the formula

[formula]

We usually assume that [formula], and in this case the short-time Fourier transform (Vφf) takes the form

[formula]

when [formula].

Now let [formula] be a translation invariant BF-space on [formula], with respect to [formula]. Also let [formula] and [formula] be such that ω is v-moderate. Then the modulation space [formula] consists of all [formula] such that [formula]. We note that [formula] is a Banach space with the norm

[formula]

(cf. [\cite=Feichtinger3]).

Assume that p,q∈[1,   ∞ ], [formula] and let [formula] and [formula] be the sets of all [formula] such that and respectively (with obvious modifications when p =   ∞   or q =   ∞  ). Then [formula] is equal to the usual modulation space [formula] when [formula]. If instead [formula], then [formula] is equal to the space [formula], related to Wiener-amalgam spaces.

In the following proposition we list some important properties for modulation spaces. We refer to [\cite=Gro-book] for the proof.

Assume that [formula] is a translation invariant BF-space on [formula]with respect to [formula], and that [formula] are such that ω is v-moderate. Then the following is true:

if [formula], then [formula] if and only if [formula]. Furthermore, [\eqref=modnorm] defines a norm on [formula], and different choices of φ gives rise to equivalent norms;

[formula].

The following generalization of Theorem 2.1 in [\cite=RSTT] shows that modulation spaces are locally the same as translation invariant Fourier BF-spaces. We recall that if [formula] and [formula] is a translation invariant BF-space on [formula], then it follows from Proposition [\ref=propbnoll] that

[formula]

is a translation invariant BF-space on [formula] which is independent of the choice of φ.

Let [formula], [formula] be a translation invariant BF-space on [formula], and let [formula] be as in [\eqref=B0def]. Also let [formula], and ω0(ξ) = ω(x0,ξ), for some fixed [formula]. Then

[formula]

Furthermore, if [formula] is compact, then

[formula]

for some constant C which only depends on K.

We need the following lemma for the proof.

Assume that [formula]. Then the following is true:

if [formula], then there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

if [formula], then there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

(1) Let φ∈C∞0 be equal to (2π)d / 2 in a compact set containing the support of the map x  ↦  Vφf(x,ξ). Then (1) is a straight-forward consequence of Fourier's inversion formula.

The assertion (2) follows by choosing φ∈C∞0 such that φ = 1 on [formula].

We may assume that ω  =  ω0 = 1 in view of Remark [\ref=newbfspaces]. Assume that [formula] and [formula]. From [\eqref=kortl2] of Lemma [\ref=korttidslemma] it follows that there exists φ∈C∞0 such that and [\eqref=locest1] follows. The proof is complete.

Let [formula] be a translation invariant BF-space on [formula], [formula] be fixed, [formula], [formula] be an open cone, and let χΓ(x,ξ) = χΓ(ξ) be the characteristic function of Γ. For any [formula] we set

[formula]

We note that |    ·    |B(Γ) defines a semi-norm on [formula] which might attain the value +    ∞  . If [formula], then [formula].

Let [formula] be a translation invariant BF-space on [formula], [formula], [formula], and let [formula]. Then ΘB(f), ΣB(f) and the wave-front set [formula] of f with respect to the modulation space B are defined in the same way as in Section [\ref=sec3], after replacing the semi-norms of Fourier Banach types in [\eqref=notconv] with the semi-norms in [\eqref=modseminorm].

In Theorem [\ref=WFidentity] below we prove that wave-front sets of Fourier BF-spaces and modulation space types agree with each others. As a first step we prove that [formula] is independent of φ in [\eqref=modseminorm].

Let [formula] be open, [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] is independent of the window function [formula].

We need some preparation for the proof, and start with the following lemma. We omit the proof (the result can be found in [\cite=CG1]).

Let [formula] and [formula]. Then for some constant N0 and every N  ≥  0, there are constants CN such that

[formula]

The following result can be found in [\cite=Gro-book]. Here [formula] is the twisted convolution, given by the formula

[formula]

when [formula]. The definition of [formula] extends in such way that one may permit one of F and G to belong to [formula], and in this case it follows that F    G belongs to [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula] for j = 1,2,3. Then

[formula]

We assume that [formula] and that ω(x,ξ)  =  ω(ξ), since the statements only involve local assertions. Assume that [formula] and let Γ1 and Γ2 be open cones in [formula] such that [formula]. The assertion follows if we prove that

[formula]

for some constant C.

When proving [\eqref=modseminormineq] we shall mainly follow the proof of [\eqref=cuttoff1]. Let [formula] be chosen such that ω is v-moderate, and let

[formula]

with characteristic functions χ1 and χ2 respectively. Also set

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=stftproperties], and the fact that ω is v-moderate we get

[formula]

for some constant C, which implies that

[formula]

where

[formula]

and χΓ2(x,ξ) = χΓ2(ξ) is the characteristic function of Γ2. Since G turns rapidly to zero at infinity, [\eqref=propupps] gives

[formula]

where C  =  ||G||L1(v).

Next we consider J2. Since, for each N  ≥  0, there are constants CN such that

[formula]

when ξ∈Γ2 and [formula], it follows from Lemma [\ref=STFTdecay] and the computations in [\eqref=J2comp] that

[formula]

Consequently, J2  <    ∞  . The estimate [\eqref=modseminormineq] is now a consequence of [\eqref=uppskattning], [\eqref=del1] and the fact that J2  <    ∞  . This completes the proof.

Since [formula] is independent of φ we usually omit φ and write [formula] instead. We are now able to prove the following.

Assume that [formula] is a translation invariant BF-space on [formula], [formula] is given by [\eqref=B0def], [formula] and [formula]. Also assume that [formula]. Then

[formula]

We may assume that ω = 1 in view of Lemma [\ref=newbfspaces]. Let Γ1,Γ2 be open cones in [formula] such that [formula], let χΓ2(x,ξ) = χΓ2(ξ) be the characteristic function of Γ2, and let φ and φ be chosen such that (1) in Lemma [\ref=korttidslemma] is fulfilled.

By [\eqref=stft-ft] it follows that

[formula]

This gives

[formula]

for some constant C, where J1 and J2 are the same as in [\eqref=J1def] and [\eqref=J2def] with [formula], [formula] and F = ||.

A combination of the latter estimate, [\eqref=J1comp] and [\eqref=J2comp] now gives that for each N  ≥  0, there is a constant CN such that

[formula]

Hence, by choosing N large enough it follows that [formula] is finite when [formula]. Consequently,

[formula]

In order to get a reversed inclusion we choose φ and φ such that Lemma [\ref=korttidslemma] (2) is fulfilled. Then [\eqref=ft-stft] gives

[formula]

for some constants C1,C2 > 0. This proves that [\eqref=thetaFBMB] holds with reversed inclusion. The proof is complete.

The following result is now an immediate consequence of Proposition [\ref=theta-sigma].

Assume that [formula] is a translation invariant BF-space on [formula], [formula] is given by [\eqref=B0def], [formula], [formula] is open and that [formula]. Then

[formula]
