Manipulating multi-photon entanglement in waveguide quantum circuits

Controlling quantum systems is not only a fundamental scientific endeavor, but promises profound new technologies [\cite=nielsen] [\cite=gi-rmp-74-145] [\cite=gi-sci-306-1330]. Quantum photonics already provides enhanced communication security [\cite=gi-rmp-74-145] [\cite=matthews-note1]; has demonstrated increased precision by beating the standard quantum limit in metrology [\cite=mi-nat-429-161] [\cite=wa-nat-429-158] [\cite=na-sci-316-726] [\cite=hi-nat-450-393] and the diffraction limit in lithography [\cite=bo-prl-85-2733] [\cite=ka-oe-15-14249]; holds great promise for quantum computation [\cite=kn-nat-409-46] [\cite=ob-sci-318-1567]; and continues to advance fundamental quantum science. The recent demonstration of on-chip integrated waveguide quantum circuits [\cite=po-sci-320-646] is a key step towards these new technologies and for further progress in fundamental science applications.

Technologies based on harnessing quantum mechanical phenomena require methods to precisely prepare and control the state of quantum systems. Manipulation of a path-encoded qubit--a single photon in an arbitrary superposition of two optical paths, which is the natural encoding for waveguides [\cite=po-sci-320-646]--requires control of the relative phase φ between the two optical paths and the amplitude in each path.

The integrated waveguide device shown schematically in Fig. [\ref=MZ]a applies the unitary operation UMZ  =  UDCeiφσZ  /  2UDC: each 50% splitting ratio (reflectivity η = 0.5) directional coupler implements UDC[\cite=matthews-note6]; while control over the relative optical phase φ between the two optical paths implements the phase gate eiφσz / 2. A single photon input into mode a is transformed into a superposition across modes c and d:

[formula]

(a single photon input into mode b is transformed into the same superposition but with a relative π phase shift). The relative optical phase is then controlled by the parameter φ, i.e.

[formula]

before the two modes are recombined at the second η = 0.5 coupler.

The device shown in Fig. [\ref=MZ]a can also be used to manipulate the phase of multi-photon, entangled states of light. Two additional relative phase controllers before and after this device would enable arbitrary one-qubit unitary operations[\cite=re-prl-73-58], including state preparation and measurement [\cite=matthews-note2]. By combining several such devices across N waveguides, it is possible to realize any arbitrary N-mode unitary operator [\cite=re-prl-73-58].

We begin by demonstrating a device which implements UMZ, in which the phase shift φ is controlled by the voltage applied to a lithographically defined resistive heater. We then use this device to manipulate 1-, 2- and 4-photon entangled states relevant to quantum metrology. Finally, we demonstrate how such a device can be used to realize a reconfigurable photonic quantum circuit.

Voltage-controlled phase shift. Waveguide devices, as illustrated in cross-section in Fig. [\ref=MZ]b, were fabricated on a 4" silicon wafer (material I), onto which a 16 μm layer of thermally grown undoped silica was deposited as a buffer to form the lower cladding of the waveguides (II). A 3.5 μm layer of silica doped with germanium and boron oxides was then deposited by flame hydrolysis; the material of this layer constitutes the core of the stucture and was patterned into 3.5 μm wide waveguides via standard optical lithographic techniques (III). The 16 μm upper cladding (IV) is phosphorus and boron doped silica with a refractive index matched to that of the buffer. Simulations indicated single mode operation at 780 nm, as shown in Fig. [\ref=MZ]c. A final metal layer was lithographically patterned on the top of the devices to form resistive elements (R) and the metal connections and contact pads (p1 and p2) shown in Fig. [\ref=MZ]a.

When a voltage is applied between p1 and p2, the current in R generates heat which dissipates into the device and locally raises the temperature T of the core and cladding material of the waveguide section directly below. To first approximation, the change in refractive index n of silica is given[\cite=kenichi] by dn / dT  =  10- 5  /  K (independent of compositional variation) which in turn alters the mode group index of the light confined in the waveguide beneath R. The devices were designed to enable a continuously variable phase shift φ∈[ -   π  /  2,π  /  2] and operate at room temperature. A consequence of the miniature and monolithic structure of the chip is that no strict global temperature control of the device is required for stability (see supplementary information).

The voltage-controlled phase inside the waveguide circuit, shown schematically in Fig. [\ref=MZ]a, is determined by a nonlinear relation [formula], which we calibrated using a 2-photon interference effect (see supplementary information): ideally, the maximally path entangled state of two photons

[formula]

is generated inside the device[\cite=ou-pra-42-2957] [\cite=ra-prl-65-1348] [\cite=ku-qso-10-493] [\cite=fo-prl-82-2868] [\cite=ed-prl-89-213601] [\cite=ei-prl-94-090502] [\cite=re-prl-98-223601] on inputting the state [formula], which we produced using the setup shown in Fig. [\ref=figS4]. After the phase shift this entangled state is transformed to [formula]. Fig. [\ref=voltage] shows the results of this calibration in which the rate of simultaneous detection of two photons at outputs g and h is plotted as a function of the applied voltage V across p1 and p2. The phase voltage relationship was verified to be a polynomial function of the form:

[formula]

where the parameters were found by means of best-fit (see supplementary information); the resulting relationship is plotted in the inset of Fig. [\ref=voltage]. In comparison to simply using 1-photon "classical" interference, this "quantum calibration" harnesses the reduced de Broglie wavelength [\cite=mi-nat-429-161] [\cite=na-sci-316-726] [\cite=wa-nat-429-158] of 2-photon interference [\cite=ou-pra-42-2957] [\cite=ra-prl-65-1348] [\cite=ku-qso-10-493] [\cite=fo-prl-82-2868] [\cite=ed-prl-89-213601] [\cite=ei-prl-94-090502] [\cite=re-prl-98-223601] to wider sample the pattern of phase dependent interference, thereby giving greater precision in the φ(V) calibration [\cite=matthews-note4]. The phase shift was found to be stable on the several hours timescale (see supplementary information).

Multi-photon entangled state manipulation. Having obtained φ(V), we were able to analyze the sinusoidal interference pattern arising from single photon detections at outputs g and h when launching single photons into input a and controlling φ(V). Ideally the probability of detecting photons varies as

[formula]

yielding sinusoidal interference fringes with a period of 2π. The observed fringes (Fig. [\ref=fringeplots]a) show a high contrast [\cite=matthews-note5] of [formula]. From this contrast, and assuming no mixture or complex phase is introduced, it is possible to calculate the average fidelity F between the measured and ideal output state [formula]. Averaging over the range [formula] we find [formula].

These devices also enable us to manipulate and analyze multi-photon entangled states: eg. the state ([\ref=2noon]) should ideally be transformed according to [formula]. To confirm the correct on-chip control of this entangled state, simultaneous detection of a single photon at each output g and h was recorded as a function of φ; this ideally yields a "λ / 2" interference fringe described by

[formula]

with period π--half the period of the 1-photon interference fringes. The 2-photon interference fringe shown in Fig. [\ref=fringeplots]b plots the measured simultaneous detection rate as a function of φ. The contrast is [formula], which is greater than the threshold [formula] required to beat the standard quantum limit[\cite=ok-njp-10-073033], as described below. Note that although a 2-photon interference fringe was used to calibrate the phase shift, this calibration is not required to claim a λ / 2 interference fringe; this is simply confirmed by comparison with the 1-photon fringe, which can be done even without calibrating the phase.

The interference fringe shown in Fig. [\ref=fringeplots]b arises from the 2-photon maximally path entangled state that is an equal superposition of N photons in one mode and N photons in another mode: [formula] [\cite=le-jmo-49-2325]. Such a state evolves under a φ phase shift in the second mode to [formula] and can in principle be used to estimate an unknown phase φ with a sensitivity Δφ = 1 / N, better than the standard quantum limit [formula] -- the limit attainable with classical schemes. By inputting the 4-photon state [formula] non-classical interference at the first directional coupler ideally produces the state [\cite=st-pra-65-033820] [\cite=na-sci-316-726] [\cite=ok-njp-10-073033]

[formula]

At the second directional coupler, quantum interference means that only the [formula] part of this state gives rise to [formula] and [formula] in the output state of the interferometer. By varying the phase φ in the interferometer, the probability of detecting either of the states [formula] or [formula] is given by

[formula]

and yields a "λ / 4" interference fringe with period π / 2. We measured the 4-photon interference fringe shown in Fig. [\ref=fringeplots]c, which plots the rate of simultaneous detection of four photons corresponding to the state [formula] (by cascading three detectors using [formula] fibre-beam splitters at the output g) against the phase φ. The contrast of this 4-photon interference is C = 0.92  ±  0.04, which is greater than the threshold to beat the standard quantum limit [\cite=ok-njp-10-073033].

Reconfigurable quantum circuits. Quantum interference of photons [\cite=ho-prl-59-2044] at a directional coupler (or beamplitter) lies at the heart of the multi-photon interference fringes shown in Fig. [\ref=fringeplots] and is the crucial underlying physical process in linear optical networks for quantum information science. The reflectivity η of a coupler determines the degree of quantum interference, thereby making η the critical parameter for quantum operation. The directional couplers in the device shown schematically in Fig. [\ref=MZ] were lithographically set to [formula]. More general photonic circuits, including optical entangling logic gates [\cite=kn-nat-409-46] [\cite=ob-nat-426-264] [\cite=po-sci-320-646] [\cite=la-nphys-5-134], are composed of a number of different reflectivity couplers, while adaptive schemes whose function depends on the input state, such as Fock state filters [\cite=sa-prl-96-083601] [\cite=re-prl-98-203602] [\cite=ok-sci-323-483], make use of devices equivalent to a single coupler with variable η. Reconfigurable photonic circuits, including routing of photons, can be realized by combining such variable η devices. By controlling the phase φ within our devices, we implement the unitary operation

[formula]

acting on the two input waveguides[\cite=re-prl-73-58]. This operation is equivalent to a single coupler with variable reflectivity

[formula]

We performed multiple quantum interference experiments[\cite=ho-prl-59-2044] in which two photons were launched into inputs a and b of the device. While scanning through the relative arrival time with an off-chip optical delay, we measured the rate of simultaneous detection of a single photon at both outputs g and h. Each experiment resulted in a quantum interference "dip" in this rate of simultaneous photon detection, centred around zero delay (eg. see insets to Fig. [\ref=VariableBS]). The depth of such a dip indicates the degree of quantum interference, which can be quantified by the visibility V = (Nmax - Nmin) / Nmax. Ideally

[formula]

The main panel in Fig. [\ref=VariableBS] plots the quantum interference visibility observed for different values of φ and hence η. The insets of Fig. [\ref=VariableBS] show two examples of the raw data used to generate this curve: (a) φ  =   - 0.49  ±  0.01 radians, V = 0.129  ±  0.009; (b) φ  =   - 1.602  ±  0.01 radians, V = 0.982  ±  0.009. The average relative visibility Vrel = V / Videal for all of the data in Fig. [\ref=VariableBS] is [formula]

Integrated optics has been developed primarily by the telecommunications industry for devices that allow high-speed information transmission, including optical switches, wavelength division multiplexers, and modulators. Quantum optics appears destined to benefit from existing integrated optics technologies, as well as drive new developments for its own needs. The reconfigurable quantum circuit we demonstrate could be used as the fundamental element to build a large-scale circuit capable of implementing any unitary operation on many waveguides. A thermal-based 32×  32 waveguide switch has been demonstrated[\cite=32]. Implementing an arbitrary unitary on this number of modes would require a comparable number of resistive elements. This is well beyond anything conceivable with bulk optics. The ms timescales available with thermal switching is suitable for reconfigurable circuits, for state preparation, quantum measurement, quantum metrology[\cite=gi-sci-306-1330], and perhaps even full-scale quantum computing[\cite=ke-prl-99-130501]. Other applications demanding fast switching, such as adaptive circuits for quantum control and feedforward, will require sub ns switching, which is possible using electro-optic materials such as LiNbO3, used to make modulators operating at 10's of GHz[\cite=wo-jtsqe-6-69].

In addition to the demonstrations presented here, these devices may be used for other quantum states of light, for the fundamental sciences of quantum optics [\cite=lo-sci-322-563] [\cite=fu-sci-282-706] [\cite=pa-sci-317-1890] and quantum information [\cite=br-rmp-77-513] [\cite=ou-sci-312-83] [\cite=me-prl-101-130501]. In particular, phase control will be particularly important for homodyne detection required for phase estimation [\cite=pe-prl-99-223602] and adaptive measurements [\cite=be-pra-73-063824] with squeezed states of light. Our results point towards adaptive and arbitrarily reconfigurable quantum networks capable of generating, manipulating and characterizing multi-photon states of light with near-unit fidelity. Possible future applications span all of quantum information science from metrology to information processing.

We provide here supplementary materials for our Article which details the experimental setup used for the reported measurements, an analysis of the characterization and properties of the resistive heater integrated in the quantum circuit and additional data on the 4-photon integrated quantum metrology experiment.

Calibration of the resistive heater: A metal layer patterned on the top of the devices provides resistive elements, metal connections and contact pads that can be used to control locally the temperature of part of the chip. When a voltage is applied across the contact pads, current flows through R and generates heat which dissipates into the device and locally raises the temperature T of the core and cladding material of the waveguide section directly beneath R. A change in the temperature of the waveguide causes a change in refractive index n. This induces a change in mode group index of the light confined in the corresponding waveguide section directly beneath R, and therefore introduces a phase difference φ with respect to the unperturbed waveguide. The heat generated inside the resistive elements R dissipates through the depth of the structure to the silicon substrate which acts as a heat sink.

The voltage-controlled phase inside the interferometer circuit is defined by a nonlinear relation [formula] that depends on the chip fabrication process. For this reason each device has to be calibrated once to relate the applied voltage to the phase difference introduced in the interferometer. We used a 2-photon experiment to find the [formula] relation modulo π, since in principle the resulting frequency of the 2-photon interference pattern is double that of the 1-photon case, allowing a wider sample of an interference fringe. The phase shift ambiguity is later corrected to modulo 2π by direct comparison to well-known 1-photon "classical" interference. To first approximation the applied phase φ is proportional to the power dissipated by the resistor. This translates into a quadratic relation between the applied voltage and the phase. To take into account deviations form the ideal case, mainly due to a non-ohmic current-voltage relation as the temperature changes (as shown in Fig. [\ref=figS5]), we fixed the form of the [formula] relation as

[formula]

where the V3 term is related to non-ohmic behavior of the resistor, and the V4 term is a combination of non-ohmic relation and the expansion of [formula] in even powers of V. The parameters computed from the complete calibration process for [formula] are reported in Table S1, which we use throughout our analysis of the 1-, 2- and 4- photon interference experiments as well as for varying the reflectivity in 2-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel experiments.

An experiment to check the stability of the phase applied in the Mach-Zehnder interferometer was performed using single photons. Fig. [\ref=figS1] shows the probability of detecting a photon in mode h when sending single photons in input a as a function of time, a voltage of 1.4V was applied across resistive element. The probability remained almost constant for more than six hours. The small deviation is imputed to the different evolution of the coupling from the waveguides g and h to the fiber array that collect the photons at the output of the circuit. However, different evolution of the coupling efficiencies does not lower the quantum mechanical performance of the device.

Metrology detection schemes: The 1-, 2- and 4-photon detection schemes for the interference fringe experiments shown in Fig. 4 of the Article are displayed in Fig. [\ref=figS3]. The 1-photon interference fringes are observed using one output of the Type-I SPDC coupled to input a of the waveguide circuit; measurement with respect to phase φ is conducted by coupling each of the outputs g and h to fibre coupled single photon counting modules (SPCMs) labeled A and B and monitoring the respective single photon count rates. The 2-photon interference fringes are observed using degenerate photon pairs coupled from the Type-I SPDC into inputs a and b; with respect to φ, the resulting "λ / 2" fringes are observed by measuring the 2-fold coincidental photon detection rate across SPCMs A and B. The 4-photon interference fringes are observed using 4-photons emitted in two modes x and y from the pulsed SPDC and coupled into modes a and b. The "λ / 4" fringe is measured by detecting either the [formula] or [formula] fock states; the latter, for example, is detected non-deterministically by cascading SPCMs B, C and D as shown with two fibre splitters and monitoring the 4-fold coincidental photon detection rate across A, B, C and D. Each fringe is plotted using the phase voltage relation derived from the resistive heater calibration. The same 2-photon setup and detection scheme is used for the the multiple Hong-Ou-Mandel experiments reported in Fig. 5 of the Article, using the μ actuator on output y of the SPDC source (shown in Fig. 2 of the Article).

4-photon integrated quantum metrology: The 4-photon N00N experiment described in the main article was repeated using a higher pump power from the Ti:Sapphire laser. This was done to confirm with a higher accuracy the reduced de Broglie wavelength by obtaining lower error bars for the experiment. As the power of the pump is increased, the 4-photon production rate increases, but by the same argument, the production of 6-photons start to be non-negligible. This reduces the contrast of the measured fringe visibility, since losses and avalanche detectors that cannot resolve photon number give rise to spurious counts of the [formula] state.

In Fig. [\ref=4noon] we show the 4-photon detection rate of the output state [formula] at this higher pump power, while varying the phase φ of one arm of the interferometer. The contrast of the 4-fold interference fringe is C = 83.1  ±  1.5%, which, despite the post-selecting detection scheme and the higher power, is still sufficient to beat the shot noise limit. Note, however, that the reduced visibility is the result of 6 photons being generated at higher pump power.
