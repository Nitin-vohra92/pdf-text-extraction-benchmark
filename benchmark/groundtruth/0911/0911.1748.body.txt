ON THE HOMOLOGICAL DIMENSION OF O-MINIMAL AND SUBANALYTIC SHEAVES

Introduction

In [\cite=lucap] we studied the category [formula] of sheaves on the subanalytic site Xsa associated to a real analytic manifold X. We defined the subcategory of quasi-injective sheaves (i.e. F is quasi-injective if the restriction Γ(U;F)  →  Γ(V;F) is surjective for each U  ⊇  V open subanalytic relatively compact) and we saw that quasi-injective are injective with respect to the functors of direct image, proper direct image and [formula] when G is a [formula]-constructible sheaf on X. Moreover we proved that the quasi-injective dimension of [formula] is finite, which implies that the cohomological dimension of the above functors is finite. However we had no answer concerning the homological dimension of [formula] (see Remark 2.3.5 of [\cite=lucap]). The aim of this paper is to show that under some conditions (concerning the cardinality [formula] of the reals) it is possible to bound this dimension. The key point is the fact that locally the category of subanalytic sheaves is equivalent to the category of sheaves on a topological space [formula]. We are reduced to work with k-sheaves on a topological space, and in this case the homological dimension is equal to the flabby dimension. Hence we are reduced to bound the cohomological dimension of Γ(U;  ·  ), for any open subset U of [formula]. In order to do that we need to assume that the cardinality of subanalytic subsets (which is equal to [formula]) is smaller than [formula], k <   ∞  .

In more details the contents of this paper are as follows.

In § [\ref=0] we recall some notions as the definitions of injective and flabby sheaf and the homological and flabby dimension of the category of sheaves. We refer to [\cite=ks1] for more details.

In § [\ref=1] we study the general case of sheaves on a topological space X with a basis T whose elements are Lindelöf and stable under finite unions and intersections. We define the subcategory of T-flabby sheaves on X by saying that F is T-flabby if the restriction Γ(U;F)  →  Γ(V;F) is surjective for each U,V∈T with U  ⊇  V. Since T forms a basis of the topology of X, we have that each open U of X has a covering {Ui}i∈I with Ui∈T. Hence

[formula]

and to bound the cohomological dimension of the functor Γ(U;  ·  ) is sufficient to bound the cohomological dimension of the functors Γ(V;  ·  ), V∈T and the cohomological dimension of the projective limit. The cohomological dimension of the projective limit is bounded if the cardinality of the index set I is smaller than [formula] for some k <   ∞  , (see [\cite=jen] or [\cite=fp] in the more general setting of quasi-abelian categories). Hence it is bounded if the cardinality of T is smaller than [formula], k <   ∞  .

In § [\ref=2] we consider an o-minimal structure [formula]. Let [formula] be the o-minimal spectrum of a definable space X. In this case T is the family of open constructible subsets of [formula]. In the case of an o-minimal expansion of an ordered group, by a result of [\cite=ejp], the T-flabby dimension of [formula] is finite. Moreover the cardinality of T is bounded by the product of the cardinality of M and the cardinality of the language of the structure M.

The case of subanalytic sheaves on a real analytic manifold is studied in § [\ref=3]. We first reduce to [formula] where U is a relatively compact subanalytic subset of X isomorphic to [formula] endowed with the Grothendieck topology induced by X. This category is equivalent to [formula], where [formula] is the o-minimal spectrum of U. In this case T is the family of open globally subanalytic subsets of U, and its cardinality is [formula]. Hence if we assume that [formula] is smaller or equal than [formula], k <   ∞   (in the case k = 1 this is the continuum hypothesis), then the homological dimension of [formula] (and hence of [formula]) is bounded.

We end this work with an example showing that in [formula] there are open subsets which do not admit countable covers.

Some preliminaries

We introduce some fundamental results about sheaves we will use in the rest of the paper. We refer to [\cite=ks1] for more details. Let X be a topological space and let k be a field. As usual, we denote by [formula] the category of sheaves of k-vector spaces.

In general injective ⇒   flabby. When k is a field we have injective ⇔   flabby ([\cite=ks1], Exercise II.10).

We shall need the following results.

The homological dimension of [formula] is finite if and only if there exists [formula] such that [formula] for any [formula] and any j  >  N.

The flabby dimension of [formula] is finite if and only if there exists [formula] such that for any open subsets U of X, any [formula] and any j  >  N we have RjΓ(U;F) = 0 (i.e. if the functor Γ(U;  ·  ) has finite cohomological dimension).

In particular, when k is a field, since injective ⇔   flabby, the homological dimension is finite if and only if the functor Γ(U;  ·  ) has finite cohomological dimension for any open subsets U of X.

T-flabby sheaves and homological dimension

Let k be a field. Let X be a topological space and suppose that X admits a family T of open subsets such that

each element of T is Lindelöf,

T is stable under finite unions and intersections,

T forms a basis for the topology of X.

Remark that flabby ⇒   T-flabby.

Let 0  →  F'  →  F  →  F''  →  0 be an exact sequence in [formula] with F' T-flabby. Then for any open subset U which is Lindelöf the morphism

[formula]

is surjective.

Proof.   We first consider a section s''∈Γ(U;F''). Since F  →  F'' is surjective, we may find a covering [formula], Ui∈T and si∈Γ(Ui;F) whose image is s''|Ui. Since U is Lindelöf, we may find a countable subcover [formula], Un∈T and sn∈Γ(Un;F) whose image is s''|Un.

Set [formula]. We prove by induction on n that there exists a section tn + 1∈Γ(Vn + 1;F) whose image is s''|Vn + 1 and tn + 1|Vn  =  tn.

This is clear for n = 0,1 and we assume it is proved for n. By the induction hypothesis there exists a section tn∈Γ(Vn;F) whose image is s''|Vn and tn|Vm  =  tm if m < n. We set for short Vn = W1 and Un + 1 = W2. We have seen that there exist tj∈Γ(Wj;F) whose image is s''|Wj for j = 1,2. On [formula] t1 - t2 defines a section of [formula] which extends to t'∈Γ(Vn + 1;F') because F' is T-flabby. Replace t2 with t2 + t'. We may suppose that t1 = t2 on [formula]. Then there exists tn + 1∈Γ(Vn + 1;F) such that tn + 1|Wj = tj, j = 1,2. The tn's glue together into a section

[formula]

which is sent to s'', which proves the surjectivity of the morphism. [formula]

Let [formula], and consider the exact sequence

[formula]

Suppose that F' is T-flabby. Then F is T-flabby if and only if F'' is T-flabby.

Proof.  Let U,V∈T with V  ⊆  U and let us consider the diagram below

[formula]

where the row are exact by Proposition [\ref=prop:soft_section_exact] and the morphism α is surjective since F' is T-flabby. It follows from the five lemma that β is surjective if and only if γ is surjective. [formula]

Let F be T-flabby. Then F is Γ(U;  ·  )-injective for each open U  ⊆  X which is Lindelöf.

Proof.  The family of T-flabby sheaves contains injective sheaves, hence it is cogenerating. Then the result follows from Propositions [\ref=prop:soft_section_exact] and [\ref=www]. [formula]

Now let us consider the case of open subsets of Lindelöf degree [formula], k <   ∞  . In order to do that we need the following result.

Let X be a topological space admitting a family T satisfying T1-T3. Suppose that X has finite T-flabby dimension. Let U be an open subset of X of Lindelöf degree [formula], k <   ∞  . Then the cohomological dimension of Γ(U;  ·  ) is finite.

Proof.  We have

[formula]

where [formula] with Ui∈T and [formula] smaller than [formula] . Since X has finite T-flabby dimension and using Proposition [\ref=TUinj] for each i we may replace RΓ(Ui;F) with [formula], where [formula] is a T-flabby resolution of F of length N <   ∞  . Since cohomological dimension of [formula] is finite if [formula] is smaller than [formula], k <   ∞   (see [\cite=jen] [\cite=fp]), then the j-th cohomology of [formula] vanishes for j > N + M. Since M,N <   ∞   are independent of F and i, the result follows. [formula]

Proof.  By Proposition [\ref=lprodim] X has finite flabby dimension. In the case of sheaves of k-vector spaces we have flabby ⇔   injective and the result follows. [formula]

Homological dimension of o-minimal sheaves

Let [formula] be an o-minimal structure. In [\cite=ejp] the authors studied sheaf cohomology of sheaves on [formula], the o-minimal spectrum of a definable space X. The category of sheaves on [formula] is equivalent to the category of sheaves on the o-minimal site, consisting of open definable subsets of X and coverings admitting a finite refinement.

Let T be the family of open constructible subsets of [formula]. Then T satisfies T1-T3, indeed

T forms a basis for the topology of [formula],

every element of T is quasi-compact,

T is stable under finite unions and intersections.

For each open subset U of [formula] and each [formula] we have

[formula]

where [formula] and Ui∈T for each i∈I. In order to apply Theorem [\ref=homdim] we need that:

the T-flabby dimension of [formula] is finite,

[formula], k <   ∞  .

If every open constructible subset U of X is normal (this is true in the case of an o-minimal expansion of an ordered group), then by Proposition 4.2 of [\cite=ejp] we have RjΓ(U;F) = 0 for all j >  dimU =  dimX.

Concerning [formula], we have that [formula], and [formula], where L denotes the language of the structure M.

Homological dimension of subanalytic sheaves

Let X be a real analytic manifold, let Xsa the associated subanalytic site and denote by [formula] the category of sheaves of k-vector spaces on Xsa. We refer to [\cite=ks2] [\cite=lucap] for the theory of subanalytic sheaves. We will see that under suitable hypothesis the homological dimension of [formula] is finite, i.e. there exists [formula] such that [formula] for any [formula] and any j  >  N.

Let X be a real analytic manifold. Then X has an atlas [formula], [formula], Un relatively compact open subanalytic subset. Let us consider the subanalytic site Xsa associated to X. In order to bound [formula] for any [formula] it suffices to bound [formula]. Indeed we have [formula] and Γ(X;  ·  ) has finite cohomological dimension (see [\cite=lucap]).

We have [formula] if [formula] for each [formula]. Then we may reduce to the case Un with the Grothendieck topology induced by the subanalytic site, i.e. the category of globally subanalytic open subsets of [formula] with coverings admitting a finite subcover. Globally subanalytic geometry is defined by the o-minimal structure given by the ordered field of real numbers expanded by globally analytic functions [formula], where f is a restriction to m of a convergent power series on some neighborhood of m.

Set X = Un and let [formula] be the o-minimal spectrum of X. The family T of open sets [formula] where U is open globally subanalytic satisfies T1-T3. Moreover the T-flabby dimension of [formula] is finite. Indeed by Proposition 4.2 of [\cite=ejp] the cohomological dimension of [formula] is finite for each [formula].

Let us see that [formula]. In order to see that we have to show that [formula], where L denotes the language of [formula]. This is true if [formula]. This is seen by identifying [formula] with [formula]. Then [formula] (see [\cite=jech]).

Let U be an open subset of [formula]. Then [formula] with Ui∈T and [formula] is smaller than [formula]. Hence every open subset of X has Lindelöf degree at most [formula]. If we assume that [formula] is smaller than [formula] for some k <   ∞   (if we suppose [formula] it is the continuum hypothesis), then Theorem [\ref=homdim] implies that the homological dimension of [formula] is finite.
