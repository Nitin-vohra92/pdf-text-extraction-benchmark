Correlated Strength in Nuclear Spectral Function

Introduction. The concept of independent particle (IP) motion has been rather successful in the description of atomic nuclei; the shell model, based on the assumption that nucleons move, independently from each other, in the average potential created by the interaction with all other nucleons, has been able to explain many nuclear properties. This success often comes at the expense of the need to use effective operators that implicitly account for the shortcomings of the IP basis.

A more fundamental approach to the understanding of nuclei has to start from the underlying nucleon-nucleon (N-N) interaction. This N-N interaction is well known from many experiments on N-N scattering, and several modern parameterizations are available. The N-N interaction exhibits a strongly repulsive central interaction at small internucleon distances, and at medium distances a strong tensor component. These features lead to properties of nuclear wave functions that are beyond what is describable in terms of an IP model. In particular, strong short-range correlations (SRC) are expected to occur.

The effects of the short-range correlations were studied for systems where the Schrödinger equation can be solved for a realistic N-N interaction [\cite=Pandharipande97]. Very light nuclei (today up to A≤  10) and infinite nuclear matter are amongst the systems where this is feasible [\cite=Pieper01] [\cite=Benhar89] [\cite=Muther00]. The corresponding calculations show that in a microscopic description of nuclear systems the short-range and tensor parts of the N-N interaction have a very important, not to say dominating, influence without which not even nuclear binding can be explained.

The consequences of these short-range correlations are that the momentum distributions of nucleons acquire a tail extending to very high momenta k and at the same time part of the strength, located in IP descriptions at low excitation energy E, is moved to very high excitation energies.

In the past, most experimental investigations were confined to rather low momenta and energies, i.e. to the region where the strength is dominated (but not entirely given) by the IP properties. In this region, the consequences of short-range correlations are indicated primarily by a depopulation of states in comparison to the predictions of IP models (including the long-range correlations which can be described by configuration mixing). According to several calculations for infinite matter and finite nuclei using different realistic N-N potentials, a depopulation of the order of 15 to 20% is expected.

Studies of one-nucleon transfer reactions like (d,3He) (see e.g. [\cite=Kramer01]) first appeared to be compatible with a 100% occupation of IP states (within ±  10MeV of the Fermi edge). It was later shown by (e,e'p) experiments that this result was a consequence of a biased choice of the nucleon radial wave functions R(r) used in the interpretation of the surface-dominated transfer reactions [\cite=Kramer01]. Reactions like (e,e'p), which are more sensitive to the nuclear interior and measure the nucleon momentum distribution as well, gave occupancies of IP states in the 60%-70% range, largely independent of nuclear mass number A [\cite=Lapikas93]. These "occupancies" correspond to partial sums of spectroscopic factors up to a limit in excitation energy. This limit was experimental and varied: it was set by the demand that one must be able to still observe and identify the IP strength. At the same time, these and other [\cite=Cavedon82] [\cite=Donnelly84] experiments showed that, apart from the overall normalization, the wave functions (in k or r-space) have shapes quite similar to the ones predicted by IP models.

From the experimental information available up to now, the depopulation of IP strength at low k,E is unambiguous. Determining the total correlated strength is not so direct, however. The total correlated strength is a factor of 4 or so (see below) smaller than the IP strength, and the determination of this strength by taking the difference of the experimental IP strength with unity suffers from the unfavorable propagation of uncertainties in the experimental measurement and theoretical interpretation of the (e,e'p) data. A direct measurement of the correlated strength is needed.

Correlated strength from (e,e'p). According to calculations that solve the Schrödinger equation for a realistic N-N interaction, the correlated strength is expected to be identifiable at high nucleon momenta k and high removal energies E; there, the values of the nuclear spectral function S(k,E), the probability to find in the nucleus nucleons of given k and E, is increased by orders of magnitude relative to IP descriptions. The correlated strength also contributes to the region dominated by the IP strength, but there it cannot be isolated via (e,e'p). While initial searches for high-k components [\cite=Bobeldijk95b] [\cite=Blomqvist95a] were restricted to low-lying states, it has been understood for some time that the SRC produce strength at high k and E simultaneously [\cite=Dieperink76] [\cite=Benhar89].

Locating this strength at large k and E is difficult. The correlated strength (perhaps 20%) is spread over a very large range in E (one to several hundred MeV), so the density of S(k,E) is very low. Processes other than the single-step proton knockout -- the basis of the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA) interpretation of (e,e'p) -- can contribute. Strength can be moved to large E (appearing as large "missing energy" Em) by processes such as multi-nucleon knockout or π-production, where the additional particle is not observed. Unless, by the choice of kinematics, this contribution can be reduced to a size where it can be corrected for by a calculation, identification of the correlated strength is not possible.

A systematic study [\cite=Sick97a] of (e,e'p) data [\cite=Marchand88] [\cite=Weinstein90] [\cite=Lourie86] [\cite=Ulmer87] [\cite=Baghaei89] [\cite=Morrison93] [\cite=Offerman96] has shown that the best chance for an identification of the correlated strength occurs for data taken in parallel kinematics, i.e. with the initial nucleon momentum [formula] parallel to the momentum transfer [formula] (most available data have been taken in (nearly) perpendicular kinematics). This study has also shown that multi-step processes have a small impact at large momentum transfer. Similar observations could be drawn from a recently published (e,e'p) experiment performed at 4He [\cite=Leeuwe01]. This Letter describes the results of the first experiment designed explicitly to study SRC via a measurement of the strength at large k and E under optimal kinematics.

Experiment. The experiment was performed in Hall C at Jefferson Lab employing three quasi-parallel and two perpendicular kinematics at a q [formula] 1 (GeV/c) (for a detailed discussion see [\cite=Rohe04]). Electrons of 3.3 GeV energy and beam currents up to 60 μA were incident upon 12C, 27Al, 56Fe and 197Au targets (in the present Letter we limit the discussion to 12C). The scattered electrons were detected in the HMS spectrometer (central momenta 2 - 2.8 GeV/c), the protons were detected in the SOS spectrometer (central momenta 0.8 - 1.7 GeV/c). Fig. [\ref=empm] gives the kinematical coverage for the parallel kinematics.

Data on Hydrogen were taken as check, to determine the various kinematical offsets and to verify the reconstruction of particle trajectories and the normalizations. Data for the IP region were also taken. The resulting proton transparency agrees with previous determinations [\cite=Garrow02] and modern calculations [\cite=Benhar04] [\cite=Pandharipande92]. The overall accuracy of the resulting cross sections is ±  6%.

The spectra of all important observables have been compared to the results of the Monte Carlo simulation package SIMC of the Hall C collaboration; excellent agreement is found. The comparison also shows that the resolution in Em (pm) is 5 MeV (10 MeV/c).

The raw data were analyzed using two different procedures, both based on an iterative approach and a model spectral function. In one, the phase space is taken from a Monte Carlo simulation of the experiment, and the spectral function is determined from the acceptance corrected cross sections. Radiative corrections are taken into account according to [\cite=Ent01]. The approach has been verified on special sets of data where radiative corrections are large. The other is based on a bin-by-bin comparison of experimental and Monte Carlo yield, where the Monte Carlo simulates the known radiative processes, multiple scattering and energy loss of the particles, spectrometer transfer matrices, focal plane detector efficiencies, the software cuts applied etc. The parameters of the model spectral function then are iterated to get agreement between data and simulation. We have found good agreement between the two procedures.

The resulting S(k,E) at low k,E shows the familiar features known from low-q (e,e'p) experiments [\cite=Lapikas00]. At large k,E we observe the tail resulting from SRC. At very large missing energy Em, the peak due to multi-step interactions involving pion emission from the various nucleon resonances, appears. The data taken in perpendicular kinematics lead to a three times larger strength compared to the parallel kinematics, which makes it clear that the cross sections measured in perpendicular kinematics receive dominant contributions from multi-step reactions (the most important ones being knock-out of another nucleon by the outgoing proton, and processes involving meson production); such data then are hardly usable to determine the correlated strength, but can serve to check our ability to predict multi-step processes.

The (e,e'p) data at low momentum transfer (leading to knock-out protons with low momenta k') have generally been analyzed using a DWBA description for the outgoing proton. At very large k' the effect of the real part of the optical potential is small, particularly for the continuum strength, where a small shift in k' is of little concern due to energy/momentum dependences which are weak as compared to the ones in the IP region. The main final state interaction effect is the absorption of the outgoing proton, which is taken into account via the transparency factor [\cite=Benhar04]. For the analysis of the Carbon data, we use T = 0.60. Also important at large E is the consideration of recoil-protons which result from 2-step processes (see below).

Results. Here, we concentrate on the overall strength in the correlated region. Fig. [\ref=integ] gives, for Correlated Basis Function theory (CBF), a schematical breakdown of the various regions of interest in the missing energy Em and the missing momentum pm plane, the quantities that are experimentally defined and identifiable -- in PWIA -- with k,E. The strength corresponding to the IP motion at low k,E amounts to ~  80% for the CBF calculation [\cite=Benhar89]. In some of the regions IP and SRC strength overlap and cannot be separated. In the shaded region, the strength from SRC is measurable with the kinematics employed in the present experiment. The shaded region at large Em is bounded by a cut that excludes unwanted contributions from Δ-excitation and π-production. These processes have been modeled using MAID [\cite=Drechsel99] to study possible contributions in our region of interest.

In this shaded region, we find the strength listed in Table [\ref=strength]. It is compared to the strength predicted by theory and integrated over the same region of k,E. This comparison is slightly dependent on the the limits of the shaded area as the k and E-dependence of experimental and theoretical S(k,E) are not the same (s. Fig. [\ref=comp]); for the present comparison we will ignore this minor effect.

The result shown in Table [\ref=strength] has been obtained using the off-shell e-p cross section σCC [\cite=Rohe04]; for this treatment the best agreement of the resulting S(k,E) from different kinematics (kin3, kin4, kin5) is found. The uncertainty quoted includes an estimate for the uncertainty due to the off-shell cross section (judging from difference of strength obtained using the cross sections σCC1 and σCC2 of [\cite=Forest83]). The error does not contain an uncertainty for the transparency factor used to correct for FSI because this value is commonly accepted and in agreement with the Glauber calculations of several authors. The statistical error is negligible.

For the kinematics of Fig.[\ref=empm] the dominant multi-step process is rescattering of the knocked out nucleon by another nucleon. Barbieri [\cite=Barbieri03a] [\cite=Barbieri03b] has calculated this process using Glauber theory and an in-medium N-N cross section accounting for Pauli blocking. He finds, in agreement with our data, that the multi-step contribution is much smaller for parallel kinematics. For the experimental result quoted in Table [\ref=strength], a multi-step correction of -  4% has to be applied.

Theoretical predictions of correlated strength. We compare our results to two calculations, performed for 16O (and adjusted to correspond to 12C) and nuclear matter, respectively. For short range properties, corresponding to S(k,E) at large k and E, the results are not expected to depend sensitively on the exact nucleus [\cite=Sick94].

Müther et al [\cite=Muther95] use the Green's function approach, approximating the self-energy of the nucleon including all contributions up to second order in the G-matrix. This finite-nucleus calculation has been performed for the Bonn B N-N potential.

In the variational CBF theory of Benhar et al. [\cite=Benhar90] the correlations are introduced in the wave function via pair-correlation operators that have the same structure as the terms occurring in the N-N interaction. The Urbana V14+TNI interaction was used, and the results for 12C were computed in the local density approximation [\cite=Sick94].

The theoretical and experimental results are compared in Table [\ref=strength]. One should note that the strength listed in Table [\ref=strength] is only a fraction of the total correlated strength; the integral over the correlated strength covers only the region where it experimentally can be identified without undue contributions from more complicated reactions. The theoretical calculations show that the correlated strength contributes also at low k and E, but there it experimentally cannot be separated from the IP strength. The full correlated strength amounts to 0.72(1.32) correlated protons for the Green's function (CBF) approach.

Table [\ref=strength] indicates that 10 % of the protons could be found experimentally in the shaded area of Fig. [\ref=integ]. The prediction of CBF theory -- which overall predicts 22% of correlated nucleons -- is close to experiment, although the detailed k and E dependence does show deviations; the correlated strength found using the Green's function approach appears to be somewhat low. This may be related to the fact that the latter approach employs a softer N-N potential which is known to lead to a significantly smaller correlation hole in the N-N wave function and to less correlated strength [\cite=Muther00]. A recent finite-nucleus calculation for 12C yields a larger correlated strength (16 %) [\cite=Muther04].

In conclusion, we have performed the first experiment to directly measure the strength due to short-range correlations in (e,e'p) reactions at high (Em,pm) and have found the results to be in reasonable agreement with predictions.
