Topological aspects of dual superconductors

Introduction

There have been considerable attempts to understand the condensed matter phenomenology in terms of topological configurations inherited from knot structures [\cite=niemi00prd] [\cite=babaev01] [\cite=babaev02prl] [\cite=niemi03plb] [\cite=neutronstars] [\cite=volovikbook]. The geometry of knotted solitons was studied to show that the total linking numbers during the soliton interactions are preserved [\cite=niemi00prd], and the anomaly structure of the fermions in a knotted soliton background was shown to be related to the inherent chiral properties of the soliton [\cite=niemi03plb]. Moreover, the curvature and torsion of a bosonic string in 3+1 dimensions were investigated [\cite=niemi03prd] to be employed as Hamiltonian variables in a two dimensional Ginzburg-Landau gauge field theory [\cite=landau50]. Interactions of vortices were also investigated [\cite=abri57] [\cite=babaev01prb] in the Ginzburg-Landau theory. In two and three dimensions, cross over from weak- to strong-coupling superconductivities was studied to figure out their thermodynamics [\cite=babaev01prb2]. Quite recently, the SU(2) Yang-Mills theory was studied to investigate a symmetry between electric and magnetic variables [\cite=faddeev02] and also to discuss the two-band superconductors with interband Josephson couplings [\cite=josep] [\cite=babaev02] [\cite=josep2] [\cite=niemihepth]. On the other hand, many experiments and ab initio calculations show two-band superconductivity in MgB2, for instance as in Refs. [\cite=mgb2] [\cite=bouquet01]. The photoemission spectroscopy of superconductor NbSe2 indicates also the two-band superconductivity associated with Fermi surface sheet-dependent superconductivity in this multi-band system [\cite=yokoya01]. Aslo theoretical studies indicate a possibility of two-gap superconductivity without intrinsic Josephson effect in liquid metallic hydrogen, deuterium and hydrogen alloys under extreme pressures [\cite=ashcroft00]-[\cite=ma].

In this paper we will investigate the two-gap superconductors by exploiting the two-flavor Ginzburg-Landau theory, where we study the magnetic flux quantization of two-gap superconductors. We will explicitly evaluate the London penetration depth and the Meissner and Josephson effects to obtain the nontrivial topological aspects of the two-gap superconductors. The knotted geometry will be also discussed in the framework of the bosonic strings.

Model for two-gap superconductors

Now, in order to describe the two-band superconductors with the interband Josephson coupling [\cite=josep] [\cite=babaev02] [\cite=josep2] [\cite=niemihepth], we start with the two-flavor Ginzburg-Landau theory whose free energy density is given by

[formula]

where Ψ1 and Ψ2 are order parameters for Cooper pairs of two different flavors, V is the potential of the form [formula], (α = 1,2) [\cite=babaev01] [\cite=babaev02]. Here we introduce η which is a characteristic of the interband Josephson coupling strength [\cite=josep] [\cite=babaev02] [\cite=josep2] [\cite=niemihepth]. In the case of η = 0 vanishing Josephson coupling, we can describe the liquid metalic hydrogen which should allow coexistent superconductivity of protonic and electronic cooper pairs [\cite=ashcroft00] [\cite=ashcroft04] [\cite=bonev04] [\cite=ma]. Moreover, the interband Josephson coupling merely changes the energy of the knot associated with the two-band superconductors. The two condensates are then characterized by different effective masses mα, coherence lengths ξα  =  αbα)1 / 2 and densities 〈|Ψα|2〉  =  bα  /  cα.

We then introduce fields ρ and zα defined as

[formula]

where the modulus field ρ is given by condensate densities and masses, [formula], and the CP1 complex fields zα are chosen to satisfy the geometrical constraint

[formula]

In the two-gap superconductors, the gauge invariant supercurrent is given by  [\cite=babaev01]

[formula]

which can be rewritten in terms of the fields ρ and zα as follows,

[formula]

where

[formula]

with z = (z1,z*2).

Since the CP1 model is equivalent to the O(3) nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) [\cite=bowick86] at the canonical level, one can introduce the dynamical physical fields na (a = 1,2,3) which are mappings from the space-time manifold (or the direct product of a compact two-dimensional Riemann surface [formula] and the time dimension R1) to the two-sphere S2, namely [formula]. On the other hand, the dynamical physical fields of the CP1 model are zα which map the spacetime manifold [formula] into S3, namely [formula]. Since S3 is homeomorphic to SU(2) group manifold and the CP1 model is invariant under a local U(1) gauge symmetry

[formula]

for arbitrary space time dependent ξ [\cite=witten79], the physical configuration space of the CP1 model is that of the gauge orbits which form the coset S3 / S1 = S2 = CP1. In order to associate the physical fields of the CP1 model with those of the O(3) NLSM, we exploit the projection from S3 to S2, namely the Hopf bundle [\cite=witten79] [\cite=adda79]

[formula]

with the Pauli matrices σa and the na fields satisfying the geometrical constraint nana = 1, to yield the free energy

[formula]

where K = 2η(m1m2)1 / 2. Introducing gauge invariant vector fields [formula] in terms of the supercurrent [formula] in ([\ref=sucurr]), [formula], one can arrive at the free energy density of the form

[formula]

Meissner effects

Now, we discuss the Meissner effect in the two-flavor topological NLSM, where the magnetic field [formula] is expressed in terms of the fields ρ, na and [formula],

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=sucurr2]), ([\ref=hfield]) and the identity [formula], we obtain the two-gap equation in terms of the ρ and na fields,

[formula]

which can also be rewritten in terms of the vector fields [formula]: [formula]. Note that in the two-gap equation ([\ref=navecbigs]) there exists topological contribution proportional to [formula] which originates from interactions of Cooper pairs of two different flavors.

Next, we consider the Meissner effect [\cite=meissner33] and the corresponding London penetration depth in the two-gap superconductor where the Maxwell equation reads [formula]. Here the rate of time variation is assumed to be so slow that the displacement current can be ignored. Combining the above Maxwell equation with the two-gap equation ([\ref=navecbigs]), we arrive at the two-gap equations for [formula] and [formula]

[formula]

Note that the spatial variation of the order parameter magnitude [formula] couples the [formula] and [formula] field equations. From ([\ref=2eom]), we can investigate the two-gap Meissner effect at low temperature T < Tc as below.

At low temperature T < Tc where the order parameter magnitude ρ vary only very slightly over the superconductor, we obtain [formula], so that we can arrive at the decoupled equations for the [formula] and [formula]

[formula]

Here note that we have the topological contribution with [formula]. The equation for [formula] in ([\ref=low2]) then yields the two-gap London penetration depth

[formula]

where the superfluid densities nαs are given by nαs = 2|Ψα|2 [\cite=ash76]. Here, we have derived the quantity Λ in ([\ref=pen]) in London limit when |Ψα| =  constant and thus [formula]. Note that the two-gap surface supercurrents screen out the applied field to yield the two-gap Meissner effect. Moreover the two-gap London penetration depth in ([\ref=pen]) is reduced to the single-gap London penetration depth ([\ref=pen2]) below in the one-flavor limit with n2s = 0.

Next, we consider the non-topological one-flavor limit with n2s = 0 and [formula]. In this limit, ([\ref=navecbigs]) and ([\ref=2eom]) are reduced to the form

[formula]

Note that in the more restricted low temperature limit T < Tc, we have the well-known single-gap equation, [formula], [formula] and [formula], which yield the single-gap London penetration depth [\cite=london35]

[formula]

where [formula], a0 is the Bohr radius and ne is the total electron density given by ne = n1n + n1s with the normal (superfluid) electron density n1n (n1s).

Exploiting the relation in ([\ref=pen2]), we can rewrite the two-gap London penetration depth ([\ref=pen]) as

[formula]

Note that, in the two-gap London penetration depth ([\ref=pen3]), with respect to the single-gap case we have more degrees of freedom associated with the physical parameters m2 and n2s to adjust theoretical predictions to experimental data for the London penetration depth.

Flux quantization and Josephson effects

Now, we consider the magnetic flux quantization of the two-gap superconductors to discuss interspecies Cooper pair tunneling, namely the Josephson effects [\cite=josephson62]. We consider a two-gap superconductor in the shape of a cylinder-like ring where there exists a cavity inside the inner radius. In order to evaluate the magnetic flux inside the two-gap superconductor, we embed within the interior of the superconducting material a contour encircling the cavity. Since at low temperature T < Tc appreciable supercurrents can flow only near the surface of the superconductor and the order parameter magnitude ρ vary only very slightly over the two-gap superconductor, integration of the supercurrent [formula] in ([\ref=sucurr2]) over a contour vanishes to arrive at the magnetic flux [formula] carried by vortex of the superconductor. On the other hand, to explicitly evaluate the phase effects of the two-gap superconductor, we parameterize the zα fields as follows

[formula]

to satisfy the constraint ([\ref=const1]). After some algebra, we obtain

[formula]

Here note that even though there exists [formula] dependence of [formula] (α = 1,2) in the each flavor channels, these contributions to [formula] cancel each other to yield vanishing overall effects. Since the order parameters Ψα are single-valued in each flavor channels, their corresponding phases should vary 2π times integers pα when the ring is encircled, to yield [formula] so that we can obtain

[formula]

Exploiting ([\ref=sdl]), we arrive at

[formula]

which is also written in terms of the na fields to yield the fractional magnetic flux quantized with vortex of the two-gap superconductors

[formula]

with the fluxoid [formula] gauss-cm2. Here note that the interband Josepson coupling does not change flux quantization since its role converts circularly symmetric vortex to a two-dimensional sin-Gordon vortex [\cite=babaev02] [\cite=josep2]. To investigate a physical meaning of the magnetic flux ([\ref=phipp2]) for the two-gap superconductor, we consider a particular case of p1 = p2 = 1. In this case, we can find the magnetic flux carried by the vortex in terms of the angle θ

[formula]

which shows that such a vortex can possess an arbitrary fraction of magnetic flux quantum since |Φ| depends on the parameter cos θ measuring the relative densities of the two condensates in the superconductor as shown in ([\ref=z1z2]). Moreover, in the case of p1 =  - p2, the magnetic flux ([\ref=phipp2]) is reduced to the well-known single-gap magnetic flux quantization, |Φ| = p1Φ0, where we can readily find θ = 0 to yield |z1| = 1 and |z2| = 0. Note that, exploiting the above identity ([\ref=vecsphase]), [formula] in ([\ref=2eom2]) can be also rewritten in terms of the phase φ1 as: [formula], where we have the explicit phase dependent term.

Knotted string geometry

Now, we consider bosonic string knot geometry associated with the two-gap superconductors. It is shown an equivalence between the two-flavor Ginzburg-Landau theory and a version of the O(3) NLSM introduced in Ref. [\cite=faddeev75]. Moreover, the model in Ref. [\cite=faddeev75] describes topological excitations in the form of stable, finite length knotted closed vortices [\cite=niemi97] to lead to an effective string theory [\cite=niemi02]. This equivalence can thus imply that the two-gap superconductors similarly support topologically nontrivial, knotted solitons.

In order to investigate the stringy features of the two-flavor Ginzburg-Landau theory, we recall that in the Hopf bundle ([\ref=bundle1]), na remains invariant under the U(1) gauge transformation ([\ref=u1gauge]). Exploiting the parameterization ([\ref=z1z2]), na can be rewritten in terms of the angles θ and β  =  φ1  +  φ2,

[formula]

Note that na is independent of the angle α  =  φ1  -  φ2 so that α can be considered as a coordinate generalization of parameter s of the string coordinates [formula], which describe the knot structure involved in our two-gap superconductor. In fact, the knot theory in the two-gap superconductor can be constructed in terms of a bundle of two strings. Moreover, the U(1) gauge transformation ([\ref=u1gauge]) is related with the angle α in such a way that

[formula]

to yield reparameterization invariance s  →  s̃(s).

In order to evaluate the Hopf invariant associated with the knot structure of the two-gap superconductor, we substitute ([\ref=z1z2]) into ([\ref=curr]) to obtain

[formula]

which is also attainable from ([\ref=vecsphase]). Note that C in ([\ref=ccos]) transforms under ([\ref=u1gauge]) as

[formula]

so that C can be identified as the U(1) gauge field and its exterior derivative produces the pull-back of the area two-form on the two-sphere S2,

[formula]

and the corresponding dual one-form [formula], which can be rewritten in terms of the angles θ and β:

[formula]

The Hopf invariant QH is then given by

[formula]

Note that if there exists a nonvanishing Hopf invariant, the bundle of two strings forms a knot so that the flat connection dα cannot be removed through the gauge transformation ([\ref=au1gauge]).

Next, to figure out the knot structure more geometrically we employ a right-handed orthonormal basis defined by a triplet [formula] where [formula] is given by ([\ref=vecn]) and

[formula]

Using this orthonormal basis, we define with [formula] a curvature and a torsion:

[formula]

Here one can readily check that the curvature κ±i and the torsion τi are invariant under the U(1)×  U(1) gauge transformations defined by ([\ref=u1gauge]) and ([\ref=u1gauge2]) and also they are not independent to yield flatness relations between them,

[formula]

Here we emphasize that the knotted stringy structures of the two-gap superconductors are constructed only in terms of the CP1 complex fields zα in the order parameters Ψα in ([\ref=psi]), since the modulus field ρ associated with the condensate densities does not play a central role in the geometrical arguments involved in the topological knots of the system.

Conclusions

We have studied the current equations in two-gap superconductor to yield the nontrivial topological aspects and discussed its relationship to Meissner effects. We have also discussed the knotted string geometry in terms of the Hopf invariant, curvature and torsion of the strings associated with U(1)×  U(1) gauge group.
