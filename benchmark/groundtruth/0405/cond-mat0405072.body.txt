Dimensionality of superconductivity in the infinite-layer high-temperature cuprate Sr0.9M0.1CuO2 (M = La, Gd)

In the high-Tc cuprate superconductors, anisotropy has been suggested to play an important role in the superconducting pairing mechanism and the elevated Tc in both experimental and theoretical work [\cite=Anderson87] [\cite=MapleBook]. It is surprising therefore to find superconductivity (SC) with Tc  =  43 K in the optimal electron-doped infinite-layer cuprates Sr0.9M0.1CuO2 (M = La, Gd), which exhibit only a 16% difference between the a and c tetragonal lattice parameters. The structure of Sr0.9M0.1CuO2 is the most basic among all high-Tc cuprates, consisting entirely of CuO2 sheets separated by rare-earth (RE) ions with tetragonal lattice parameters c  =  3.41 Å and a  =  3.95 Å.[\cite=Jung02a] The recent success in producing high-quality polycrystalline samples of the infinite-layer cuprates with no observable impurity phases [\cite=Jung02a] has engendered a renewed interest in these compounds. X-ray near-edge absorption spectroscopy indicate electron doping, [\cite=Liu01] and bulk SC has been verified by powdered magnetization (M) measurements [\cite=Kim02a] and specific heat (C) measurements (data presented later in this work). Several recent studies of these high purity polycrystalline samples suggest three-dimensional (3D) superconductivity in Sr0.9La0.1CuO2. Scanning tunnel spectroscopy (STS) measurements [\cite=Chen02] indicate an unconventional but isotropic s-wave superconducting gap with no pseudogap at zero field. The s-wave symmetry of the gap is also supported by specific heat measurements and Cu-site substitution studies,[\cite=Jung02b] [\cite=Chen02] [\cite=Liu03] although it may be contradicted by NMR measurements.[\cite=Williams02] Kim et al [\cite=Kim02a] estimated the c-axis coherence length (ξc) from a Hao-Clem analysis [\cite=Hao91] of the reversible magnetization of grain-aligned polycrystal, and found that ξc exceeds the spacing between the CuO2 planes, indicating 3D superconductivity. On the other hand, they also find significant anisotropy between magnetic fields H  ≤  5 T oriented parallel and perpendicular to the CuO2 planes, with an anisotropy ratio γ  =  ξc  /  ξab  =  Habc2 / Hcc2  =  9.3, which is larger than γ  =  5 observed in YBa2Cu3O7 - δ  although much smaller than γ  =  55 observed in optimally doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 - δ. [\cite=Kim02a] [\cite=Kim02b] [\cite=Farrell89] [\cite=Farrell88] It is interesting to note that the only major crystallographic difference between the a-b and the c directions in Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 is the presence of oxygen in the a-b plane, which allows coupling of adjacent Cu spins and has been implicated as the cause of antiferromagntic ordering or spin fluctuations in other members of the high-Tc cuprate family, as well as a possible mechanism for superconducting pairing. The importance of the CuO2 planes to the SC in Sr0.9M0.1CuO2 is further supported by the fact that Ni substitution on the Cu site rapidly suppresses Tc whereas out-of-plane Gd substitution on the Sr site leaves Tc unchanged. [\cite=Jung02b] [\cite=Jung03]

In this work we determine the upper critical field Hc2 and the irreversibility field Hirr of Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 by means of magnetization and penetration depth measurements in pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T in order to directly investigate the degree of upper critical field anisotropy and the role of vortex fluctuations. We also present specific heat (C) and magnetization (M) measurements in low DC fields to 6 T as a function of temperature (T) of Sr0.9Gd0.1CuO2, confirming the bulk coexistence of Gd paramagnetism (PM) and SC. Our results suggest strong confinement of the spin pairing wave function to the CuO2 planes and significant field-induced superconducting fluctuations.

Noncrystalline samples of Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 and Sr0.9Gd0.1CuO2 were prepared under high pressures as described previously. [\cite=Jung02a] Magnetization measurements in pulsed magnetic fields were performed at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in Los Alamos, NM in a 3He refrigerator in a 50 T magnet using a compensated coil. The sample consisted of four pieces of polycrystalline Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 with a total mass of 4.8 mg to maximize signal and minimize heating. The irreversibility field Hirr was identified from the onset of reversibility in the M(H) loops. The penetration depth of Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 was determined by measuring the frequency shift Δf of a tunnel diode oscillator (TDO) resonant tank circuit with the sample contained in one of the component inductors. [\cite=Mielke01] A ten turn 0.7 mm diameter aluminum coil was tightly wound around the sample with a filling factor of greater than 90%, with the coil axis oriented perpendicular to the pulsed field. To maintain temperature stability, the sample was thermally anchored to a sapphire plate and placed in 3He exchange gas. Small changes in the resonant frequency can be related to changes in the penetration depth Δλ by [formula], where R is the radius of the coil and rs is the radius of the sample. [\cite=Mielke01] In our case, R  ~  rs  =  0.7 mm and the reference frequency f0  ~  60 MHz such that Δf = (0.16 MHz/μm)Δλ.

The frequency shift Δf relative to the normal state and the corresponding Δλ of Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 are shown in Fig. [\ref=penetrationdepth]a as a function of H. The inset shows the T-dependence of Δf in zero magnetic field. The normal state resonant frequency f that is reached with increasing field can only be determined for T  ≥  30 K; for lower T the sample remains superconducting to 60 T so Δf is estimated. The frequency shift of the empty coil has been subtracted from all data. In applied fields, the SC transition is very broad, which can be attributed to the large anisotropy in Hc2 of the randomly orientated grains in the polycrystal.[\cite=Kim02a] By contrast, the SC transition as a function of T at H  =  0 is very sharp, indicating a high quality sample. Therefore, the onset of diamagnetism with decreasing H in the λ(H) data can be identified with the largest Hc2, Habc2 for fields in the CuO2 planes. The onset is defined as H where Δf  >  5 kHz (Δλ  >  30 nm), just above the noise of the experiment. Different onset criteria have only minor effects on the determination of Habc2, as shown in Fig. [\ref=phasediagram] where Habc2 using an onset criteria of 10 kHz and 20 kHz are shown as open circles and diamonds, respectively. The upper critical field Habc2 is linear in T up to the H  =  60 T maximum of the experiment, and extrapolates to 153 T at zero temperature. (Although if we assume the typical Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg curvature for an orbitally limited superconductor, [\cite=Werthamer66] 153 T would constitute an upper limit for Habc2). The linearly extrapolated value of 153 T is close to the s-wave Pauli paramagnetic limit of [formula] T, where Δ  =  13 meV has been determined independently from STS data. [\cite=Chen02] This raises the possibility of spin-limited superconductivity for H in the plane, which has also been observed in YBa2Cu3O7 - δ.[\cite=OBrien02]

Determination of the critical fields for H along the c-axis, Hcc2, from these data on noncrystalline samples is more difficult. However, at fields below the onset of diamagnetism we do observe a significant change in slope of the λ(H) data, indicated as Hkink in Fig. [\ref=penetrationdepth]b. The Hkink vs T curve is shown in Fig. [\ref=phasediagram] and extrapolates to 12 T at zero temperature. This value of Hkink(T = 0) is close to Hcc2 =  14 T determined from a Hao-Clem analysis mentioned previously. [\cite=Kim02a] We therefore associate Hkink with Hcc2. In λ(H) measurements of a noncrystalline sample, a change in slope near Hcc2 could be expected since the number of grains in the polycrystal that are superconducting varies with H for Hcc2 <  H  <   Habc2, whereas for H  <   Hcc2 the entire sample is superconducting, yielding different H dependencies of the flux expulsion in these two regions. Our data yield an anisotropy ratio [formula], roughly in agreement with γ  =  9.3 determined from low field studies. [\cite=Kim02a]

In penetration depth measurements of single crystalline organic superconductors for H along the conducting planes, a kink below Hc2 for fields has been associated with the vortex melting transition.[\cite=Mielke01] However, in this work we have determined the vortex dynamics separately by means of magnetization measurements in pulsed fields, and we find a significant difference between the onset of irreversibility in M(H), Hirr, and Hkink as shown in Fig. [\ref=phasediagram]. Following similar arguments for the λ(H) measurements, we note that Habirr >   Hcirr in cuprate superconductors, therefore we assign the onset of irreversibility for polycrystalline Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 to Habirr. Although we can't rule out the possibility that Hkink might be associated with a vortex phase transformation, the fact that Hkink(T  →  0) saturates, and Hkink(T  →  0) <  < Habc2(T  →  0) indicates that Hkink(T) is unlikely caused by a thermally-induced vortex melting transition for H||ab. Future pulsed-field measurements on grain-aligned or epitaxial thin film samples will be necessary to conclusively determine whether Hkink(T) obtained in this work may be identified with Hcc2(T).

The region between Habirr and Habc2 in the phase diagram in Fig. [\ref=phasediagram] is significantly larger than is observed in other electron-doped high-Tc compounds where Hc2 typically tracks Hirr. [\cite=Fournier03] [\cite=MapleBook] It is particularly surprising that Habirr(T  →  0)  ~  45 T is much smaller than Habc2(T  →  0)  ~  150 T. In hole-doped cuprates, a large separation between Hirr and Hc2 is often observed and is generally referred to as a vortex-liquid phase due to thermally induced fluctuations. The large discrepancy between Habirr and Habc2 in e-doped Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 even to T  →  0 suggests the presence of field-enhanced SC fluctuations in Sr0.9La0.1CuO2. Enhanced SC fluctuations down to very low T may be consistent with a scenario of SC coexisting with a competing order, such as a spin-density wave (SDW) near a quantum critical point. [\cite=Demler01] In particular, antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations associated with the competing SDW can be enhanced by external fields. [\cite=Demler01] [\cite=Sachdev02] [\cite=Chen03] The conjecture of a competing order in the SC state of Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 is also consistent with our recent STS studies, [\cite=Chen04] [\cite=Yeh04] where we observe the emergence of a second energy gap with increasing tunnelling current upon the closing of the SC gap. In contrast to the SC gap, the current-induced gap is not spatially uniform probably due to interactions of the SDW with charge disorder. [\cite=Chen03] We note that experimental evidence for coexistence of a SDW with cuprate superconductivity has been found in other high-Tc compounds. [\cite=Lee99] [\cite=Kang03] [\cite=Matsuura03] [\cite=Lake02] [\cite=Mook02]

To further investigate the dimensionality of the superconductivity, low-field C(T) and M(T,H) of polycrystalline Sr0.9Gd0.1CuO2 were measured with H up to 6 T and T down to 1.8 K in a Quantum Design Physical Properties Measurement System and a SQUID magnetometer, respectively. In contrast to in-plane Ni substitution on the Cu site, out of plane Gd substitution on the Sr site does not suppress Tc. In fact, the Gd ions exhibit local moment paramagnetism (PM) that coexists with SC to low T. [\cite=Jung03] Figure [\ref=Coexistence] shows M(H) at T  =  5 K, and zero field/field cooled magnetization curves as a function of T in the inset. The M(H) curve in the main figure can be viewed as a superposition of a SC hysteresis curve and a Brillouin function resulting from the PM of Gd. Further proof for this coexistence is evident in the inset, which shows a large positive magnetization associated with Gd paramagnetism, but nevertheless significant hysteresis between zero-field-cooled and field-cooled curves, indicating superconductivity.

In Fig. [\ref=SrGdCuO2], the magnitude of the paramagnetic contribution from the Gd ions is investigated quantitatively. The main figure shows C(T) at H  =  0 and H  =  6 T. The H  =  0 data is fit by a T3 dependence to model the phonon contribution, (the electronic contribution at these temperature can be neglected). For H  =  6 T, C(T) can be fit by the same T3 dependence as the H  =  0 data, plus an additional contribution from the Gd paramagnetic moments, derived from mean field theory assuming the Hund's rule J = 7 / 2 moment, and one Gd ion for every ten unit cells. The fit is remarkable, considering that there are no fitting parameters. In the upper inset of Fig. [\ref=SrGdCuO2], 1 / χ is plotted as function of T, where the line is a Curie-Weiss fit with μeff  =  8.2μB, which is close to the Hund's rule moment of 7.6 μB and the typically observed Gd moment of 8 μB. Thus we can conclude that all of the Gd ions in the sample are paramagnetic and coexist with SC down to 1.8 K, despite the close proximity of the Gd ions to the CuO2 planes (1.7 Å). This is evidence for a strong confinement of the superconducting singlet spin pair wave function to the CuO2 planes. On the other hand, the c-axis superconducting coherence length ξc  =  5.2 Å is longer than the spacing between the Gd ion and the CuO2 planes (1.7 Å), and also exceeds the interplane distance, implying 3D SC. The notion of 3D SC is corroborated by our STS studies, [\cite=Chen02] which probe the charge degrees of freedom and reveal an isotropic s-wave superconducting gap. The apparent problem of 3D isotropic s-wave SC coexisting with strong Gd local moments less than 1.7 Å from the CuO2 planes can be resolved by considering the spin and charge (orbital) degrees of freedom of the Cooper pairs separately. Whereas the singlet spin pairing is confined to the CuO2 planes, the orbital pair wave function could still overlap adjacent CuO2 planes, resulting in 3D SC for all values of T  <  Tc and H  <  Hc2. The bulk nature of the SC is evident in the lower inset of Fig. [\ref=SrGdCuO2], which shows the electronic contribution to C plotted as ΔC / T vs T. The peak near 43 K is associated with Tc, and the ratio ΔC / γTc is 2.9, assuming a Sommerfeld coefficient [\cite=Liu03] of γ  =  1.2 mJ/mol K2.

In conclusion, a large upper critical field anisotropy ratio γ  =  8 has been inferred from penetration depth measurements of Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 in pulsed fields, despite the nearly cubic crystal structure. The in plane upper critical field Habc2 extrapolates close to the Pauli paramagnetic limit HPc2  =  159 T, suggesting possible spin limiting for this orientation, as has been observed in YBa2Cu3O7 - δ. [\cite=OBrien02] There is a large separation between Habc2 and the irreversibility field Habirr, which extends down to T  →  0, and is abnormal for electron doped high-Tc cuprates. This suggests the existence of field-induced superconducting spin fluctuations perhaps due to a competing SDW. In spite of the significant anisotropy in the upper critical fields, ξc is longer than the spacing between CuO2 planes, indicating three-dimensionality of the orbital wave function. The low-field thermodynamic measurements of M(T) and C(T) for Sr0.9Gd0.1CuO2 polycrystals indicate a coexistence of bulk SC with Gd paramagnetism, with the full J  =  7 / 2 Hund's rule moment despite the close proximity of Gd atoms to the CuO2 planes, and a Tc of 43 K in both Sr0.9Gd0.1CuO2 and Sr0.9La0.1CuO2. This can interpreted in terms of a strong confinement of the spin degrees of freedom of the Cooper pairs to the CuO2 planes, whereas the orbital wave functions overlap adjacent CuO2 planes, and exhibit isotropic s-wave symmetry as determined by STS measurements.
