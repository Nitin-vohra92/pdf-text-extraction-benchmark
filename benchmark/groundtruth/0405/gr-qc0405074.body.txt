Quasistationary collapse to the extreme Kerr black hole

Introduction

The gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric star to the Schwarzschild black hole is well understood. The idealized model of dust collapse described by Oppenheimer and Snyder [\cite=os] provides a famous analytic example. In contrast, the belief that the collapse of a rotating star leads finally to the Kerr black hole relies on Penrose's cosmic censorship hypothesis combined with the black hole uniqueness theorems (see [\cite=he] [\cite=heu]) and has not been rigorously proved so far. As a step in this direction we want to discuss in this paper the possibility of a quasistationary collapse to the Kerr black hole, i.e. the possibility of sequences of equilibrium configurations of stars approaching a black hole limit continuously. Of course, the surface of a stationary star can never become identical with a black hole horizon since the horizon is a null hypersurface. The question is, however, whether it is possible to come arbitrarily close to this limit. In the nonrotating, i.e. spherically symmetric case, the answer is "no". Under the reasonable assumption, that the mass-energy density is non-negative and does not increase outwards, the circumferential radius r* of a static fluid sphere of total mass M always satisfies the "Buchdahl inequality" r*  >  (9 / 8)  rs, where rs = 2M is the corresponding Schwarzschild radius (see, for example, [\cite=wald]). Consequently, the relative redshift of photons emitted from the surface of the star and received at infinity is bounded by the value 2.

In the following, we consider stationary and axisymmetric, uniformly rotating perfect fluid configurations with a "cold" equation of state and their possible connection to black holes. The relevant basic equations can be found, for example, in [\cite=hs] - [\cite=nm1]. We use units where the speed of light c as well as Newton's gravitational constant G are equal to 1 and choose the spacetime signature (-  +  +  + ).

Equilibrium stellar models, Kerr black holes and their possible connection

In this chapter we shall analyse necessary parameter relations for a possible connection between equilibrium stellar models and Kerr black holes. Therefore we have to provide some basic relations for rotating fluids in equilibrium.

The four-velocity of the fluid must point in the direction of a linear combination of the two Killing vectors ξ  =  ∂  /  ∂t and η  =  ∂  /  ∂φ corresponding to stationarity and axisymmetry:

[formula]

The Killing vector ξ is fixed by its normalization ξiξi  →   - 1 at spatial infinity (we assume asymptotic flatness). The orbits of the spacelike Killing vector η are closed and η is zero on the axis of symmetry. Ω = uφ / ut is the angular velocity of the fluid body with respect to infinity. The factor e- V = ut follows from uiui =  - 1:

[formula]

The energy-momentum tensor is given by

[formula]

where the mass-energy density ε and the pressure p are related by a "cold" equation of state, ε  =  ε(p), following from

[formula]

for T = 0. The specific enthalpy

[formula]

can be calculated as follows:

[formula]

[formula]

Note that h(0) = 1 for most equations of state. For our conclusions, however, it will be sufficient to assume h(0) <   ∞  . From Tik;k = 0 we obtain

[formula]

where V0, the constant surface value (corresponding to p = 0) of the function V defined in ([\ref=V]), is related to the relative redshift z of zero angular momentum photons emitted from the surface of the fluid and received at infinity:

[formula]

Equilibrium models, for a given equation of state, are fixed by two parameters, for example Ω and V0. The total mass M and angular momentum J are given by

[formula]

where Σ is a spacelike hypersurface (t = constant) with the volume element [formula] and the future pointing unit normal ni, see [\cite=wald]. The baryonic mass M0 corresponding to the local conservation law (ρui);i = 0 is

[formula]

Note that nearby equilibrium configurations with the same equation of state are related by [\cite=hs] [\cite=bw]

[formula]

In contrast to the non-rotating case, where Birkhoff's theorem implies that the exterior spacetime is always given by the Schwarzschild metric, the exterior metric of a rotating star is not Kerr in general. However, we now want to ask whether it is possible to approach a situation where the surface of the star becomes "almost" the horizon of a Kerr black hole. First we note that the black hole horizon is characterized by a linear combination ξ  +  ΩHη of the two Killing vectors which is null [\cite=ca], where ΩH is the "angular velocity of the horizon":

[formula]

[formula]

Since all other linear combinations ξ  +  Ω  η of the Killing vectors become spacelike on the horizon the desired black hole limit can only be approached for

[formula]

Because of ([\ref=V]) and ([\ref=cc]), the surface of the fluid is characterized in general by

[formula]

A black hole limit therefore requires

[formula]

A combination of ([\ref=MJ]) and ([\ref=M0]) leads to the formula

[formula]

cf. equation (II.28) in [\cite=bw]. With ([\ref=h]) and ([\ref=cc]) we get finally

[formula]

Since (ε + 3p) / (ε + p)  ≤  3 (the weak energy condition is sufficient for this) the second term on the right-hand side of the last equation is bounded by 3h(0)  eV0M0. Consequently, for finite h(0) and finite baryonic mass M0, the limit V0  →    -    ∞   implies

[formula]

Together with ([\ref=Om1]) and ([\ref=Om2]) this leads to our conclusion that the only possible candidate for a black hole limit of fluid bodies in equilibrium is the "extreme" Kerr black hole characterized by the maximal possible value of |J| / M2, i.e.

[formula]

Discussion

Now that we have shown that the extreme Kerr black hole is the only candidate, we want to discuss if and how this limit can be reached. In the case of a rotating, infinitesimally thin disc, strong numerical evidence for this transition was found by Bardeen and Wagoner [\cite=bw] who were also able to establish its nature. Neugebauer and Meinel [\cite=nm2] [\cite=nm3], see also [\cite=m], confirmed these results in finding and analysing the exact solution to the disc problem. Hence, the existence of a continuous connection of equilibrium fluid configurations to the extreme Kerr black hole has been proved. (Note that the disc is a limiting case of a rotating fluid for p / ε  →  0.)

The horizon of the extreme Kerr black hole has an infinite proper distance from any place in the exterior region characterized, in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, by r > M. Indeed, the r > M part of the extreme Kerr metric results from the limit V0  →    -    ∞   of the disc solution in the "exterior", asymptotically flat region. A different limit is obtained, however, if the limit is taken in rescaled and corotating coordinates corresponding to r = M. The resulting "inner world" contains the disc and is not asymptotically flat but approaches the "extreme Kerr throat geometry" [\cite=bh] at spatial infinity. Strictly speaking, there is not yet a horizon. The "inner" and the "outer" world are separated by the "throat region", which is also characterized by r = M. In this subtle way the black hole limit is realized. Presumably, a small perturbation will lead to a genuine Kerr black hole with |J| slightly less than M2.

It should be possible to prove that the above scenario holds whenever the limit V0  →    -    ∞   of a rotating fluid body is attainable. A further example has already been given by the "relativistic Dyson rings" [\cite=akm], see also [\cite=a+]. Other ring solutions with a variety of equations of state also exhibit this limit [\cite=tf] [\cite=sh].

A perturbation analysis based on this quasistationary, "maximally rotating" route to the Kerr black hole may lead to some insight into the dynamical collapse of rotating stars supplementary to the investigations close to the non-rotating case.
