Markov's theorem in 3-manifolds

Overview

According to Birman [\cite=B], Markov [\cite=Ma] originally stated his braid equivalence theorem using three braid moves; later there was another brief announcement of an improved version of Markov's theorem by Weinberg [\cite=W] consisting of the two well-known braid-equivalence moves: conjugation in the braid groups and the 'stabilizing' or 'Markov' moves (M-moves). Our first main result is a one-move Markov theorem which we now state.

An L-move on a braid consists of cutting one arc of the braid open and splicing into the broken strand new strands to the top and bottom, both either under or over the rest of the braid:

[formula]

L-moves and isotopy generate an equivalence relation on braids called L-equivalence. In § 4 we prove that L-equivalence classes of braids are in bijective correspondence with isotopy classes of oriented links in S3, where the bijection is induced by 'closing' the braid to form a link. As a consequence, L-equivalence is the same as the usual Markov equivalence and thus the classical Markov theorem is sharpened. The proofs are based on a canonical process for turning a combinatorial oriented link diagram in the plane (with a little extra structure) into an open braid. Our braiding as well as the L-moves are based on the building blocks of combinatorial isotopy, the triangle moves or Δ-moves. This makes the proof conceptually very simple. Our braiding operation is essentially the same as the operation using a 'saw-tooth' given by J. Birman in [\cite=B]. We use the point at infinity as the reference point for braiding and so a saw-tooth becomes a pair of vertical lines that meet at infinity. The change of reference point to infinity makes the proof of Markov theorem easier because there are very few ways that saw-teeth can obstruct each other.

Moreover, the local nature of our proof allows us to formulate and prove first the relative version of Markov theorem, another new result stating that, if two isotopic links contain the same braided portion then any two corresponding braids which both contain that braided portion differ by a sequence of L-moves that do not affect the braided portion. We then prove a second relative version of the theorem for links which contain a common closed braid and deduce an analogue of Markov theorem for knot isotopy in complements of knots/links, which we finally extend to an analogue of Markov theorem for links in arbitrary closed 3-manifolds. More precisely, let M be a closed connected orientable 3-manifold. We can assume that M is given by surgery on the closure of a braid B in S3, thus M is represented by B. Furthermore, any oriented link in M can be represented as the closure of a further braid β such that [formula] is also a braid and we shall call it mixed braid. Then the mixed braid equivalence in S3 that reflects isotopy in M is generated firstly by L-moves, as above, but performed only on strings of β and secondly by braid band moves or b.b.-moves. These are moves that reflect the sliding of a part of a link across the 2-disc bounded by the specified longitude of a surgery component of the closure of B. I.e. suppose a string of β is adjacent to one of B, then a slide of the first over the second (with a half-twisted band) replaces β by a braid with one or more extra strings parallel to the strings of B which form the appropriate component in the closure:

Diagrams, isotopy and the L-moves

A knot is a special case of a link, so from now on we shall be referring to both knots and links as 'links'. Throughout the first part of this paper we shall be working in a combinatorial setting. In particular, we consider oriented links/geometric braids in 3-space each of the components/strands of which is made of a finite number of straight arcs endowed with matching orientation; also their diagrams, that is, regular projections on the plane (with only finitely many crossings), where in addition no vertex of the link/braid should be mapped onto a double point. A geometric braid diagram or simply a braid has a top-to-bottom direction and, in addition, we require that no two crossings are on the same horizontal level. If we slice up in general position (i.e. without cutting through crossings) a braid diagram on n strands, it may be seen as a word on the (well-known) basic crossings  σi  and  σi- 1  for  [formula] (we refer the reader to figure 9 for an example). The set of braids on n strands modulo isotopy gives rise to the braid group Bn with presentation:

[formula]

The operation in the group is concatenation (we place one braid on top of the other), and the identity element is the braid on n strands that does no braiding. Note that the elements of Bn are also called 'braids', but in here there will be no ambiguity, since we shall be working with geometric braid diagrams. There are two combinatorial moves on diagrams which we shall consider.

Δ-move: An arc is replaced by two arcs forming a triangle (and its inverse), respecting orientation and crossings. 'Respecting crossings' means that, if we lift the diagram to an embedding in 3-space, then the Δ-move lifts to an elementary isotopy (see figure 3 for examples).

Subdivision: A vertex is introduced/deleted in an arc of the diagram.

Subdivision moves may be viewed as special cases of Δ-moves. We shall call the equivalence relation generated by these two moves a combinatorial isotopy or just an isotopy. It is a classical result of combinatorial topology that this notion of isotopy is equivalent to the standard definition of combinatorial (or PL) isotopy of the embedding obtained by lifting to 3-space, and this in turn is equivalent to the notion of isotopy in the smooth category. Moreover, Reidemeister [\cite=Rd1] (and Alexander, Briggs [\cite=AB]) proved that a Δ-move can break into a finite sequence of planar Δ-moves and the three local Δ-moves illustrated below (known as 'Reidemeister moves') with their obvious symmetries (for a detailed account see [\cite=BZ]).

[formula]

Let D be a link diagram/braid and P a point of an arc of D such that P is not vertically aligned with any of the crossings or (other) vertices of D (note that P itself may be a vertex). Then we can perform the following operation: Cut the arc at P, bend the two resulting smaller arcs apart slightly by a small isotopy and introduce two new vertical arcs to new top and bottom end-points in the same vertical line as P. The new arcs are both oriented downwards and they run either both under or both over all other arcs of the diagram. Thus there are two types of L-moves, an under L-move or Lu-move and an over L-move or Lo-move. (Recall figure 1 above for an example of the two braid L-moves.)

Below we illustrate Lo-moves applied to an edge QR of an oriented link diagram such that QR moves via isotopy from a downward arc to an upward arc through the horizontal position. The thick circle will represent 'the rest of the diagram', while the region inside the circle shall be called 'the magnified region'. Note that, if we join freely (using the dotted arcs) the two new arcs we obtain a link diagram isotopic to the one on which the L-move was applied.

[formula]

Definition 2.1 could be given even more generally so as to accommodate the possibility of the new vertical strands running upwards (figure 4b). Although, for the purposes of this paper we shall only consider L-moves with the new vertical arcs oriented downwards.

Using a small braid isotopy, a braid L-move can be equivalently seen with a crossing (positive or negative) formed:

[formula]

This gives the following algebraic expression for an Lo-move and an Lu-move respectively.

[formula]

[formula]

where α1, α2 are elements of Bn and [formula], [formula] are obtained from α1, α2 by replacing each σj by σj + 1 for [formula].

L-moves and isotopy generate an equivalence relation in the set of braids, which we shall call L-equivalence. Let now B be a braid. The closure of B is the oriented link diagram C(B) obtained by joining each top end-point to the corresponding bottom end-point by almost vertical arcs as illustrated in figure 6, where B is contained in a 'box'. (Note that we draw some smooth arcs for convenience.)

[formula]

Our aim is to prove the following theorem.

The braiding process

We shall define an inverse bijection to C by means of a canonical braiding process which turns an oriented link diagram (with a little extra structure) into a braid. Note that we only work with oriented diagrams, so in the sequel we shall drop the adjective. Let D be a link diagram with no horizontal arcs, and consider the arcs in D which slope upwards with respect to their orientations; call these arcs opposite arcs. In order to obtain a braid from that diagram we want: 1) to keep the arcs that go downwards.

2) to eliminate the opposite arcs and produce instead braid strands. If we run along an opposite arc we are likely to meet a succession of overcrossings and undercrossings. We subdivide (marking with points) every opposite arc into smaller - if necessary - pieces, each containing crossings of only one type; i.e. we may have:

[formula]

We call the resulting pieces up-arcs, and we label every up-arc with an 'o'/'u' according as it is the over/under arc of a crossing (or some crossings). If it is a free up-arc (and therefore it contains no crossings), then we have a choice whether to label it 'o' or 'u'. The idea is to eliminate the opposite arcs by eliminating their up-arcs one by one and create braid strands instead. Let now [formula] be the top vertices of the up-arcs; fix attention on one particular top vertex P = Pi and suppose that P is the top vertex of the up-arc QP. Associated to QP is the sliding triangle T(P), which is a special case of a triangle needed for a Δ-move; it is right-angled with hypotenuse QP and with the right angle lying below the up-arc. Note that, if QP is itself vertical, then T(P) degenerates into the arc QP. We say that a sliding triangle is of type over or under according to the label of the up-arc it is associated with. (This implies that there may be triangles of the same type lying one on top of the other.)

The germ of our braiding process is this. Suppose for definiteness that QP is of type over. Then perform an Lo-move at P followed by a Δ-move across the sliding triangle T(P) (see figure 8). By general position the resulting diagram will be regular and QQ' may be assumed to slope slightly downwards. If QP were under then the Lo-move would be replaced by an Lu-move. Note that the effect of these two moves has been to replace the up-arc QP by three arcs none of which are up-arcs, and therefore we now have fewer up-arcs. If we repeat this process for each up-arc in turn, then the result will be a braid.

[formula]

In the following example we illustrate the braiding process applied to a particular link diagram (we do not draw the sliding triangles). The numbering of the strands indicates the order in which we eliminated the up-arcs. Obviously, for different orders we may obtain different braids.

[formula]

It is clear from the above that different choices when doing the braiding (e.g. when choosing labels for the free up-arcs or when choosing an order for layering sliding triangles of the same type) as well as slight isotopy changes on the diagram level may result in important changes in the braid picture. For the proof of Theorem 2.3 we would like to control such changes as much as possible. For this we shall need a more rigorous setting. Sliding triangles are said to be adjacent if the corresponding up-arcs have a common vertex (then the sliding triangles will have a common corner). Triangle condition Non-adjacent sliding triangles are only allowed to meet if they are of opposite types (i.e. one over and the other under).

[formula]

A generic diagram is a link diagram with subdividing points and sliding triangles put in general position with respect to the height function, such that the following conditions hold: 1)  there are no horizontal arcs,

2)  no two disjoint subdividing points are in vertical alignment, where by 'disjoint' we mean subdividing points that do not share a common edge.

3)  any two non-adjacent sliding triangles satisfy the triangle condition and if they intersect, this should be along a common interior (and not a single point).

Conditions 1 and 3 are related to the braiding, whilst condition 2 ensures that no pair of strands in the resulting braid will be in the same vertical line.

A generic Δ-move is a Δ-move between generic diagrams.

In the sequel, by 'Δ-moves' we shall always refer to the local planar Δ-moves together with the Reidemeister moves.

It is clear from Lemma 3.5 that generic link diagrams are dense in the space of all diagrams; indeed, a non-generic link diagram may be seen as a middle stage of the isotopy between generic diagrams. Thus w.l.o.g. we shall assume from now on that all diagrams are generic; also, by virtue of Lemma 3.5 that all isotopy moves are also generic.

We are now ready to give a rigorous braiding process. Namely, take a link diagram and eliminate one by one the up-arcs in the way described above. By Remark 3.2 (1) the order of the eliminating moves is now irrelevant.

Any (oriented) link diagram is isotopic to the closure of a braid .

Proof of Theorem 2.3

By the local nature of the Δ-moves we may assume that for a given link diagram we have done the braiding for all up-arcs except for the ones that we are interested in every time; these will be lying in the magnified region placed inside the braid. By Remark 3.2 (1) this choice does not affect the final braid. Now, two braids that differ by a finite sequence of L-moves have isotopic closures. Therefore the function C from L-equivalence classes of braids to isotopy types of link diagrams is well-defined. To show that C is a bijection we shall use our braiding process to define an inverse function B. Namely, for a diagram D let B(D) be the braid resulting from the braiding algorithm applied to it. We have to show that B is a well-defined function from link-diagram types to L-equivalence classes of braids, therefore we have to check that B(D) does not depend up to L-equivalence on the choices made before the braiding and on Δ-moves between link diagrams. The choices made before the braiding consist of the subdividing points we choose and the labelling we may have to choose for some free up-arcs. Finally, we have to show that C and B are mutually inverse. This is easy: Closing the result of the braiding process yields a link isotopic to the original one, therefore [formula]. Moreover, applying the braiding process to the closure of a braid yields precisely the same braid back again (from the way we defined closure), so [formula].

The proof relies entirely on Remark 3.2 (1) and on the following two lemmas.

Corollary 4.5 proves independence of subdivision and labelling for diagrams, and thus we are done with the static part of the proof. Using Corollary 4.5 we have also proved independence of Δ-moves related to condition 3 of Definition 3.3 (recall proof of Lemma 3.5). It remains to consider the effect of the rest of the Δ-moves. We shall check first the planar Δ-moves. These will include the examination of Δ-moves related to conditions 1 and 2 of Definition 3.3. Now, a Δ-move can be regarded as a continuous family of diagrams (see figure 18). From the above we shall assume that the triangle condition is not violated. Also, by symmetry, we only have to check the Δ-moves that take place in the first quarter of the plane, above the edge AB, and w.l.o.g. AB is an up-arc. Therefore, the Δ-moves we want to check can split into moves that take place above AB within the vertical zone defined by A and B and moves that take place outside this zone. All resulting braids will be compared with the braid obtained by subdividing AB at an appropriate point P. I.e. we have:

(i) Inside subdivision   Consider the continuous family of triangles with edge AB and all the new vertices lying on the vertical line of an interior point P of AB (figure 18). A new vertex cannot aligne horizontally with B. So, if P'B is a new edge before the horizontal position from below, we can see L-equivalence of the corresponding braids by introducing an extra vertex in AB at P and applying Lemma 4.1 (see left-hand side of figure 19).

[formula]

If P''B has passed above the horizontal position and therefore it becomes a down-arc (cf. Definition 3.3, condition 1), we introduce an L-move at the point B and we show that again we obtain the same braid as if we had originally subdivided AB at P (see right-hand side of figure 19). The type of the L-move is over/under according as AB is an over/under up-arc.

[formula]

Note that, if AB were originally a down-arc, then the new edges would pass from down-arcs to opposite arcs through the horizontal position. In this case, according to the way we do the braiding and to the triangle condition, we may need to subdivide further the new opposite arcs and apply lemmas 4.1 and 4.2. Before continuing with the proof we introduce some extra notation. We shall denote by (APB) the braid obtained by completing the braiding on the arcs AP and PB. Suppose now we subdivide AB at a different point, Q say. Then, by Lemma 4.1 we have (APB)  ~  (AQB), since they both differ by an L-move from (APQB). In figure 20 the dotted line indicates a possible braid strand between the vertical lines of P and Q (cf. Definition 3.3, condition 2).

[formula]

(ii) Outside 'subdivision'   Consider now the continuous family of triangles with edge AB and all the new vertices lying on the vertical line of a point P that lies outside the vertical zone defined by A and B (see figure 21). By symmetry we only need to examine the Δ-moves taking place on the side of B, say. Assume first that P is close enough to B so that no braid strand passes in between the vertical lines of P and B. Then obviously (APB)  ~  (AB) (braid isotopy). Reasoning as above, if P' is a new vertex such that P'B is below the horizontal position, then (AP'B) differs from (APB) by an L-move introduced at B. Also, if P'' is a new vertex such that P''A is below the horizontal, then (AP''B) differs from (AP'B) by an L-move introduced on AP'' at the point P''.

[formula]

Assume now that the Δ-move introduces a new vertex Q so that between the vertical lines of P and Q there is a braid strand (cf. Definition 3.3, condition 2). In this case we see the L-equivalence by introducing and deleting two Lo-moves (figure 22).

[formula]

We shall now check the Reidemeister moves (recall figure 3). To check the first two moves we follow similar reasoning as above, but we shall demonstrate it here for completeness. For the first one, we illustrate below that the braid obtained after the performance of the move is equivalent to the one obtained before the move, up to braid isotopy and one Lo-move:

[formula]

For the second move we complete the braiding of the left-hand side diagram and we notice that, using braid isotopy, we can undo an Lu-move. We then obtain the braid that we would obtain from the right-hand side diagram with label 'u' for the up-arc.

[formula]

We shall now check the third type of Reidemeister moves or 'triple point moves'. If all three arcs are down-arcs then the move is a braid isotopy. If either of the outer arcs is an up-arc then the move is invisible in the braid. It remains to check the case where both outer arcs are down-arcs and the middle arc is an up-arc. But then the following trick changes the situation to the one where all three arcs are down-arcs.

[formula]

We have now proved that the function B from isotopy types of link diagrams to L-equivalence classes of braids is well-defined, and the proof of Theorem 2.3 is now completed.   [formula]

A comment on conjugation

The classical Markov braid theorem states that: Isotopy classes of (oriented) link diagrams are in 1-1 correspondence with certain equivalence classes in the set of all braids, the equivalence being given by the following two algebraically formulated moves between braids in [formula]:

Conjugation: If  α,β∈Bn  then  α  ~  β- 1αβ.

Markov moves or M-moves: If   α∈Bn  then  α  ~  ασ+ 1n∈Bn + 1  and  α  ~  ασ- 1n∈Bn + 1.

It is clear from Remark 2.2 that an M-move is a special case of an L-move. Also, it follows from the proof of Theorem 2.3 that conjugation can be realized by a (finite) sequence of L-moves. Indeed, let α and β- 1αβ be two conjugate braids. Then their closures C(α) and C(β- 1αβ) are isotopic diagrams and so they differ by a sequence of n, say, Δ-moves; so, for each stage of isotopy we obtain the following sequence of link diagrams

[formula]

which we turn into the braids [formula], say, using our algorithm. From the above, every consecutive pair of these braids differs by a finite sequence of L-moves. Now, the way we defined the closure of a braid (recall figure 6) guarantees that B0 is β- 1αβ and Bn is α. Thus, conjugation is only a redundant 'auxilliary' move used to bring the M-moves inside the braid box, and therefore Theorem 2.3 indeed sharpens the classical result.

As a concrete example, we illustrate below the main instances of the isotopy sequence from the closure of a braid that is conjugate to α by an elementary crossing, up to C(α).

[formula]

Relative version of Markov's theorem

As a consequence of the proof of Theorem 2.3 we can prove a relative version of the result. By a braided portion of a link diagram we mean a finite number of arcs in the link which are all oriented downwards (so that the braid resulting from our braiding process will contain this braided portion).

Extension of results to other 3-manifolds

In this section we use the methods of Theorem 2.3 to prove a second relative version (relative to a fixed closed subbraid) and deduce an analogue of Markov's theorem for isotopy of oriented links in knot/link complements in S3. This is then used for extending the results to closed connected orientable 3-manifolds.

Markov's theorem in knot complements

Let [formula] be the complement of the oriented knot K in S3. By 'knot complement' we refer to complements of both knots and links. Using Alexander's theorem and the definition of ambient isotopy, [formula] is homeomorphic to [formula], where B̂ is isotopic to K and it is the closure of some braid B. Let now L be an oriented link in M. If we fix B̂ pointwise on its projection plane we may represent L unambiguously by the mixed link [formula] in S3, that is, a link in S3 consisting of the fixed part B̂ and the standard part L that links with B̂ (for an example see figure 27a).

[formula]

Let now L1, L2 be two oriented links in M. It follows from standard results of PL Topology that L1 and L2 are isotopic in M if and only if the mixed links [formula] and [formula] are isotopic in S3 by an ambient isotopy which keeps B̂ pointwise fixed. See for example [\cite=RS]; chapter 4. In terms of mixed diagrams this isotopy will involve the fixed part of the mixed links only in the moves illustrated in figure 27b. These shall be called 'extended Reidemeister moves'. Therefore Reidemeister's theorem generalizes as follows in terms of mixed link diagrams.

We now wish to find an analogue of Markov's theorem for links in M. Since B̂ must remain fixed we need a braiding process for mixed link diagrams that maps B̂ to B (and not an L-equivalent braid or a conjugate of B). Such braids shall be called mixed braids (see figure 28c for an example). Also the subbraid of a mixed braid that complements B shall be called the permutation braid.

[formula]

An alternative more 'rigid' proof modifying the braiding of section 3 is given in [\cite=La],[\cite=La1].

We are now ready to prove the second relative version of Markov's theorem and a version for knot complements.

[formula]

Markov's theorem in oriented 3-manifolds

Let M be a closed connected orientable (c.c.o.) 3-manifold. It is well-known [\cite=L], [\cite=Wa], [\cite=R] that M can be obtained by surgery on a framed link in S3 with integral framings and w.l.o.g. this link is the closure B̂ of a braid B. We shall refer to B̂ as the surgery link and we shall write M = χ(S3,B̂). Moreover by the proof given in [\cite=L] it can be assumed that all the components of the surgery link are unknotted and furthermore that they form the closure of a pure braid. Thus we may assume that B is a pure braid. So M may be represented in S3 by the framed B̂ and if we fix B̂ pointwise we have that links/braids in M can be unambiguously represented by mixed links/braids in S3 - exactly as discussed in 5.1. Thus Theorem 5.3 holds also in this case. Only here, the braid B is framed and we refer to it as the surgery braid. Now a link L in M may be seen as a link in [formula] with the extra freedom to slide across the 2-discs bounded in M by the specified longitudes of the components of B̂.

Let b be the oriented boundary of a ribbon and let [formula] and [formula] be two oriented mixed links, so that [formula] is the band connected sum (over b) of a component, c, of L1 and the specified (from the framing) longitude of a surgery component of B̂. This is a non-isotopy move in S3 that reflects isotopy between L1 and L2 in M and we shall call it band move. A band move can be thus split in two steps: firstly, one of the small edges of b is glued to a part of c so that the orientation of the band agrees with the orientation of c. The other small edge of b, which we shall call little band (in ambiguity with the notion of a band), approaches a surgery component of B̂ in an arbitrary way. Secondly, the little band is replaced by a string running in parallel with the specified longitude of the surgery component in such a way that the orientation of the string agrees with the orientation of b and the resulting link is [formula].

Since we consider oriented links in M there are two types, α and β say, of band moves according as in the second step the orientation of the string replacing the little band agrees (type α) or disagrees (type β) with the orientation of the surgery component - and implicitely of its specified longitude. (See figure 31, where p is an integral framing of the surgery component.)

[formula]

[formula]

The two types are related in the following sense.

[formula]

The discussion can be summarized by saying that link isotopy in M can be regarded as isotopy in [formula] together with a finite (by transversality) number of band moves. Therefore Theorem 5.2 extends to:

Note now that neither of the two types of band moves can appear as a move between braids; so in order to state our extension of Markov's theorem we modify the band move of type α appropriately by twisting the little band before performing the move. So we have the following.

A braid band move or, abbreviated, a b.b.-move is a move between mixed braids that reflects isotopy in M = χ(S3,B̂) and is described by the following picture (where the middle stage is only indicative).

[formula]

Note that a braid band move can be positive or negative depending on the type of crossing we choose for performing it.
