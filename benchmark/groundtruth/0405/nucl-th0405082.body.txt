Charge Form Factors of Quark-Model Pions II

In a previous letter [\cite=CCP] we demonstrated that simple constituent-quark models of the pion yielded charge form factors in agreement with data for both low Q2 [\cite=AMEND] and Q2 > 12. Recently new measurements [\cite=VOLMER] provided more precise data for Q2 < 2 GeV2 and new data at higher values of Q2 are expected. The purpose of this paper is to show that simple relativistic constituent-quark models are consistent with all existing data and with a relatively narrow range of form factor values for larger momentum transfers.

The unitary Poincaré representations of confined quark states are specified by mass and spin operators together with the choice of a kinematic subgroup [\cite=KP] [\cite=FC]. The Poincaré covariant, conserved, effective current operator Iμ(x),

[formula]

is generated by the dynamics from an input that is covariant under the kinematic subgroup. The results of [\cite=CCP] were based on the use of null-plane kinematics for the generation of an effective current density. With that choice the kinematic subgroup leaves the null-plane n  ·  x, with n2 = 0, invariant. With a convenient choice of the axes the components of n are given by n = {1,0,0,1}. It is an important feature of null-plane kinematics that the charge form factor does not depend on the pion mass. This feature is essential for the empirical success of constituent-quark phenomenology applied to pion form factors. With point-form kinematics [\cite=ALLEN] form factors obtain as functions of η: = Q2 / 4m2π, which is large for moderate values of Q2. Thus, with simple wave functions, form factors are much too small for a realistic representation [\cite=BERTRAND]. There is no intent to approximate features of quantum field theory in the construction of such quark models. In particular the representations of constituent-quark states are not meant to approximate Fock-space amplitudes and/or satisfy features of perturbative QCD [\cite=BRODSKY]. Meson mass operators of constituent-quark models may be defined by simple spectral representations

[formula]

Neither the wave function representing the pion state nor the explicit representation, [formula], of the current density are observable. The observable form factor is invariant under simultaneous unitary transformations, which may preserve the kinematic subgroup [\cite=KP] [\cite=FC].

As in ref. [\cite=CCP] the models are specified by input currents with the representation

[formula]

and a representation of the pion state by wave functions [formula] which is proportional to a radial wave function u(k2) and Melosh rotation matrices

[formula]

The argument k2 is related to the null-plane momenta by

The pion charge form factor is a functional of the radial wave function, u(k2),

In [\cite=CCP] a Gaussian shape

[formula]

was used for numerical convenience. We expect that a rational shape

[formula]

may specify a better model. A wave function of essentially the same shape can also be generated by the equation [\cite=POLY]

[formula]

with the parameters adjusted for that purpose. Conventional QCD motivated mass operators[\cite=ISGUR], designed to fit meson spectra, produce wave functions that require substantial modification of the current [\cite=CALDAR] .

The form factors shown in Figs. 1 and 2 are calculated assuming mq = .23 GeV, b = .35 GeV and .43 GeV for the wave functions eq. ([\ref=GAUSS]) (dash-dot line) and eq. ([\ref=FRAT]) (solid line) respectively. The dash line is obtained using the ground-state solution of eq. ([\ref=MASS]) with α = .1 GeV2, β = .4, γ = .229 GeV and λ = .3 GeV. The shapes of the three wave functions are compared in Fig. 3. All three parameterizations are in agreement with existing data. We expect that for larger values of Q2 the form factors obtained with the Gaussian wave function ([\ref=GAUSS]) will be in disagreement with future measurements. The results are in agreement with the QCD approximations of Maris and Tandy [\cite=MARIS] for Q2  <  2GeV2, and with their expectations for larger values of Q2.

For the pion decay constant, [\cite=CALDAR] [\cite=JAUS]

The three wave functions yield the values 92.5 MeV, 101.5 MeV and 101.8 MeV with gqA = 1.
