The Work of Behram Kursunoglu

Professor Behram Kursunoglu died shortly before the 2003 Coral Gables conference, the latest in a long line of Coral Gables conferences which Behram had been organizing since 1964. This particular conference had originally been planned to honor Professor Paul Frampton on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday, but with Behram's untimely passing the conference additionally became a memorial to him, to his work and to his life.

At the conference Behram had been scheduled to speak on the topic "Will Einsteinian theories continue to dominate twenty-first century physics?". And even though I had not had an opportunity to discuss his talk with him, I believe I know what he was going to talk about. Specifically, a few years earlier at a previous Coral Gables conference at the turn of the millennium, Behram had commented to me about the fact that Time magazine had named Albert Einstein to be the man of the twentieth century. Behram remarked to me that in another hundred years Time magazine would declare Einstein to be the man of the twenty-first century as well. Behram felt that up to now we had only just begun to skim the surface of the implications of general relativity, and that during the upcoming century general relativity would prove to be the foundation from which even greater and deeper physics was going to arise.

It should come as no surprise that Behram thought this way about Einstein, since Behram's own career had focused on general relativity ever since Behram's graduate student days at the University of Cambridge in the early 1950s, with general relativity being at the very center of Behram's research during his entire professional career. Behram's own particular interest had been on a geometric unification of gravitation first with electromagnetism and subsequently with all of the other fundamental forces, an issue to which Einstein himself devoted much of his own career; and to establish the context of Behram's own work, it is useful to recall the main ways in which such a unification by metrication has historically been sought.

Characteristic of attempts to achieve unification through metrication was the need to find some generalization of general relativity, akin to the way general relativity had itself generalized special relativity. Specifically, while special relativity provided a single comprehensive framework for treating both electromagnetism and Newton's laws of motion (by modifying the latter), special relativity did not encompass gravity, with Newton's law of gravitation not being invariant under Lorentz transformations. The remedy for this was not to come up with a gravitational law of force which (like the Lorentz electromagnetic law of force) would be Lorentz invariant, but to instead enlarge the set of invariances to be obeyed by nature, with general coordinate invariance replacing Lorentz invariance, and with the metric gμν(x) emerging as the gravitational field.

The first attempt at unification through metrication was developed by Weyl[\cite=Weyl1918] as early as 1918, only two years after Einstein's development of general relativity. Weyl introduced a local transformation he referred to as a gauge" transformation under which the metric and the electromagnetic field would transform as

[formula]

[formula]

with gravitation and electromagnetism thus unifying by sharing a common α(x). Given such a joint transformation, in addition Weyl departed from the Riemannian geometry of general relativity and replaced it by a new geometry, Weyl Geometry", in which the connection was generalized to the Aμ-dependent

[formula]

so that instead of being zero, the covariant derivative of the metric would instead be given by

[formula]

with Eq. ([\ref=4]) having the remarkable property of being invariant under the joint Eqs. ({[\ref=1]) and ([\ref=2]) (a transformation under which λμν transforms into itself). With the covariant derivative of a tensor transforming as a vector, Weyl was thus able to connect gμν and Aμ in an intricate geometrical fashion, though at the price of departing from Riemannian geometry. As a theory Weyl's theory has two noteworthy aspects. First, it introduced the notion of a gauge transformation, with its usage in Eq. ([\ref=1]) entailing a change in the magnitude of gμν and thus of its size or gauge. (In the parlance of modern gauge theories, it is a change in the (complex) phase of a field which is now known as a gauge transformation, with Eq. ([\ref=2]) continuing to be known as a gauge transformation, but with Eq. ([\ref=1]) now being referred to as a scale transformation.) Second, if imposed as a symmetry, such a scale invariance would require all mass parameters to be zero identically, and thus exclude any fundamental Newton constant GN. With it thus possessing neither the Einstein equations or Riemannian geometry, Weyl's theory was not so much a generalization of Einstein gravity, but rather a fairly substantial departure from it, and has not been followed in the literature.

The second attempt at unification through metrication is the now very familiar work of Kaluza and Klein based on a role for spacetime dimensions beyond four, a program which later evolved into superstring theory. In the embryonic work of Kaluza and Klein themselves spacetime was envisaged as being 5-dimensional, with its thus 15-dimensional gravitational field decomposing into a 10-component gμν which was to serve as the standard 4-dimensional spacetime gravitational field, a 4-component g5μ = Aμ to serve as the standard electromagnetic field, thus leaving over a 1-component g55  =  φ which would transform as a 4-dimensional spacetime scalar, a field which is now identified as a Higgs field. With such Kaluza-Klein theories being based on the 5-dimensional Einstein equations, they immediately possessed a fundamental GN, albeit one which was (unlike the role played by e in Eq. ([\ref=4]) above) not connected to any of the intrinsic structure of the theory. However, the theory did have one nice feature in regard to mass scales, namely the compactification of the fifth of the five dimensions would lead to a compactification radius and thus to a dynamical mass scale for particles; though if the compactification radius is taken to be given by the Planck length scale (N / c3)1 / 2 associated with GN, such extra dimensions would be way too miniscule to be detectable.

The third attempt at unification through metrication is the non-symmetric gravity program followed by Behram himself[\cite=Kursunoglu1952] [\cite=Kursunoglu1991], an approach also seriously considered at one point by both Einstein[\cite=Einstein1925] [\cite=Einstein1950] and Schrödinger[\cite=Schrodinger1950], and also worked on more recently by Professor John Moffat an attendee at the 2003 Coral Gables conference. On noting that without symmetrization, a general 4-dimensional spacetime rank two tensor ĝμν would contain 10 symmetric and 6 anti-symmetric components, we see that in the 16 components of ĝμν there is precisely the number of degrees required for a 10-component symmetric gravitational gμν and a 6-component anti-symmetric electromagnetic Fμν. Unification of gravity with electromagnetism can thus be achieved by working in a geometry in which the full ĝμν metric is not required to be symmetric. To decompose the full ĝμν into its symmetric and anti-symmetric pieces one can thus set

[formula]

where q is an appropriate parameter. What makes this decomposition so interesting is that with gμν being dimensionless, the parameter q has to have the same dimension as the electromagnetic field strength, viz. (mass  /  length  /  time2)1 / 2. Consequently, and unlike Weyl's approach, a unification based an a non-symmetric ĝμν requires the presence of an intrinsic dimensionful parameter from the outset; and on setting

[formula]

we see that there has to be an intrinsic length scale, r0, in the theory, one defined above purely in terms of classical quantities. Moreover, in a unification which is to include quantum mechanics as well, this length scale could be identified as the fundamental Planck scale via

[formula]

though in his work Behram considered other options for the value of r0, even including the pure imaginary ones allowed of r0 and q since their overall phases were only fixed by the requirement that the product r20q2 be identified as the real and positive c4 / 2GN. In a unification based on Eq. ([\ref=5]) then, not only do we unify gravitation with electromagnetism, we additionally see an intrinsic and indispensable role for Newton's constant from the very outset.

To see how things work in the theory it is convenient to first consider a theory with just the regular symmetric gμν and Lagrangian

[formula]

where Fμν is the usual electromagnetic tensor and φμν is an auxiliary antisymmetric field which is not writable as the covariant curl of a vector. Euler-Lagrange variation of this theory yields

[formula]

to thus yield as solution the standard Einstein-Maxwell equations of motion. Now because both gμνFμν and φμνRμν are kinematically zero, the Lagrangian of Eq. ([\ref=9]) can be replaced by the equivalent Lagrangian

[formula]

with the replacing of gμν by gμν  +  φμν / q thus still allowing one to recover the standard Einstein-Maxwell equations of motion in an ordinary gμν symmetric geometry.

While the above analysis shows that it is permissible to replace gμν by gμν  +  φμν / q, the resulting equations of motion do not put electromagnetism and gravity on a completely equivalent footing, since even while the Maxwell tensor serves as the source of the Einstein tensor, gravity does not serve as a source for electromagnetism. To remedy this Behram departed from ordinary Einstein gravity with its symmetric gμν, and instead went to a 16-component ĝμν, a theory in which tensor manipulations would then have to be defined anew, in much the same manner as Weyl had to define the Aμ-dependent λμν of Eq. ([\ref=3]) in his theory. To facilitate the construction of the needed geometry, Behram went beyond the standard eμa vierbein formulation of gravity introduced by Weyl in 1928 (in which gμν  =  ηabeμaeνb) by introducing a second vierbein field fμa. In terms of this second vierbein the electromagnetic tensor can then be introduced as

[formula]

while the contravariant ĝμν can be introduced as

[formula]

with its covariant counterpart having symmetric and anti-symmetric parts which are once and for all defined as

[formula]

The two vierbeins thus define the theory. As well as serve as the building blocks of the theory, these two vierbeins additionally provide the theory with a road to symmetry, since the SO(3,1) invariance of gμν to Lorentz transformations in the eμa space is not only augmented by an S0(2) invariance of the quantity on the right-hand side of Eq. ([\ref=11]), the combining of the two vierbeins into one 8-component vector allows it to serve as the fundamental representation of an 8-dimensional symplectic group. In this way Behram had thus developed a starting point for an incorporation of the symmetries of elementary particle physics (the use of complex r0 and q even allows for a connection to unitary groups), an issue he pursued relentlessly throughout his life.

In Behram's generalized theory there is a generalized connection Γλμν, one not symmetric in its two covariant indices, and it is with respect to this connection that ĝμν;ρ is to vanish according to

[formula]

and it is with respect to this connection that the Riemann tensor is to be constructed as

[formula]

For such a Riemann tensor the Ricci tensor R̂μν would possess both a symmetric (Rμν) and an anti-symmetric (μν) piece. Given this structure Behram then introduced a generalized Lagrangian (ĝ  =   detĝμν, g =  detgμν)

[formula]

Its Euler-Lagrange variation leads to the same Einstein equation for the symmetric Rμν as given before in Eq. ([\ref=9]), but with the Fμν  =  φμν and ∂ν(g1 / 2φμν) = 0 equations being replaced by

[formula]

where the || symbol denotes a very particular geometric derivative[\cite=Kursunoglu1991] that Behram was able to construct in his theory. As such Eq. ([\ref=17]) thus provides the intricate connection between electromagnetism and geometry which Behram had sought.

As well as work on unification through metrication, Behram will also be remembered for the Coral Gables Conference Series which have been occurring over a span of almost forty years. The very first of these conferences took place in 1964 at which Behram presented a paper A new symmetry group for elementary particles". As a conference organizer Behram was indefatigable in continuing this conference series over the years, while also never flagging as a researcher. Indeed, he continued to make original presentations at the Coral Gables conferences right up to the end. Thus he presented Recent developments in gravitational theory and an intrinsic cosmological parameter" at the 2000 Coral Gables conference, New Facts on the nature of gravitational force and non-linear oscillations of space" at the 2001 Coral Gables conference, and The layered structure of the universe" at the 2002 Coral Gables conference.

Beyond physics, Behram also established and ran the Global Foundation which organized meetings on and concerned itself with the great social and international issues of the day. He was an urbane and cultured human being, one who can truly be called a Renaissance man. During his lifetime Behram championed many causes, but the one which I suspect may have given him the most pleasure was the eventual coalescence of elementary particle physics and gravitation, something he presciently first advocated more than fifty years ago, and patiently continued to persistently champion ever thereafter.
