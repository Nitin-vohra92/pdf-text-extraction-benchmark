Knot theory in handlebodies

Introduction

A natural generalization of the classical knot theory in S3 considers knots and links in more general 3-manifolds. While topological quantum field theories provide an approach to invariants of links in closed (i.e. compact without boundary) 3-manifolds, bounded 3-manifolds are also of interest, since -for once- they give rise to closed, connected, orientable 3-manifolds. In particular, we have on the one hand handlebodies, which give rise to 3-manifolds via the Heegaard decomposition, and on the other hand knot complements, which give rise to 3-manifolds via the surgery technique. In [\cite=LR] knots and links in knot complements and 3-manifolds are studied via braids. Here we study knots and links in handlebodies. The special case of the solid torus is the only bounded manifold common in both categories, and its knot theory has been studied quite extensively from various viewpoints (see [\cite=T], [\cite=HP], [\cite=HK], [\cite=L1] [\cite=GL] [\cite=L2], [\cite=Pa], [\cite=D], [\cite=H]). Various aspects of the knot theory of a handlebody have been studied in [\cite=P1], [\cite=P2], [\cite=S], [\cite=Li], [\cite=V], [\cite=Lie]. Let now Hg denote a handlebody of genus g. A handlebody of genus g is usually defined as [formula], where I is the unit interval. See Fig. 1.

[formula]

Fig. 1. A handlebody of genus 3.

Equivalently, Hg can be defined as [formula] where Ig denotes the pointwise fixed identity braid on g indefinitely extended strands, all meeting at the point at infinity, see Fig. 2. Thus Hg may be represented in S3 by the braid Ig. Now let L be an oriented link in Hg. Then L will avoid the g hollow tubes of Hg, and also it will not pass beyond the boundary of Hg from either end. Equivalently, the link L in Hg may be represented unambiguously by the mixed (g,g)-tangle [formula] in S3, which by abuse of language we shall call mixed link (see Fig. 2). The subbraid Ig shall be called the fixed part and L the moving part of the mixed link. A mixed link diagram [formula] is then a diagram of [formula] projected on the plane of Ig, which is equipped with the top-to-bottom direction. Note that, if we remove Ig from a mixed link we are left with an oriented link in S3.

[formula]

In this paper we study isotopy of oriented links and equivalence of braids in Hg via their mixed link and mixed braid representatives in S3. The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we study knot isotopy in handlebodies combinatorially, we establish the notion of a braid in Hg, and we prove that every oriented link in Hg can be braided. In Section 3 we prove a geometric version of the Markov theorem for oriented links in Hg (Theorem 3) using the so-called L-moves (Definition 6) and the Relative Version of Markov theorem. In Section 4 we define the algebraic structures of braids in S3 that represent braids in Hg and we prove two algebraic versions of the Markov theorem for handlebodies. The first one (Theorem 4) uses the L-moves. The second one (Theorem 5) uses a presentation of the groups Bg,n, and its formulation resembles the classical Markov theorem for S3. Only, here the Markov move (the one that introduces a twist) has to take place anywhere on the right of the braid. Also, as we prove, not all conjugations in the groups Bg,n induce isotopy in the handlebody. This disproves a conjecture of A. Sossinsky, [\cite=S]. In Section 5 we discuss which conjugations are allowed (Theorem 6). Finally, in Section 6 we discuss what kind of maps should be defined on appropriate quotient algebras in order to replace the notion of a Markov trace.

Parts of this paper have been presented at the AMS meeting in Buffalo, Spring '99, at the AMS meeting in Louisiana, Spring 2000, at the 'Knots 2000' in Korea and at the KLM meeting in Siegen, January 2001. We would like to thank the referee for several valuable comments. Also Jozef Przytycki and Adam Sikora for very important discussions.

Knots and braids in Hg

Throughout the paper the handlebody Hg will be represented in S3 by the braid Ig, as defined in Section 1, and a link L in Hg will be represented by the mixed link [formula] in S3. The set-up is similar to the one of [\cite=LR], and we will refer to [\cite=LR] for the proofs of results needed here and already established there. Otherwise, we have tried to present our results in a self-contained manner. All links will be assumed oriented and all diagrams piecewise linear (PL). Whenever we say 'knots' we mean 'knots and links'. Finally, we will be thinking in terms of diagrams for both knots and braids.

In the PL category ambient isotopy is realized through a finite sequence of the so-called Δ-moves in three-space.

[formula]

Fig. 3. Mixed isotopy moves.

Reidemeister [\cite=Rd1] (and Alexander, Briggs [\cite=AB]) proved that a Δ-move on a link diagram in S3 can break into a finite sequence of the three local Δ-moves known as 'Reidemeister moves', and of planar Δ-moves, i.e. moves, whose spanning triangle does not meet any other arcs on the projection plane, with their obvious symmetries and choices of orientation. From the above we deduce that knot isotopy in Hg is realized combinatorially through the following (compare with the relative version of Reidemeister theorem, Theorem 5.2 of [\cite=LR]):

Assuming that the strands of Ig are oriented downwards, we can now define:

[formula]

Fig. 4. Geometric mixed braids.

Fig. 4 illustrates an abstract geometric mixed braid enclosed in a 'box', as well as an example in B6. Note that the set of geometric mixed braids on n strands does not form a group, as composition may not be well-defined. Geometric mixed braids in Hg may be visualized as having endpoints on three different parallel planes, parallel to the plane of the paper, such that the subbraid Ig lies on the middle one, the endpoints labelled 'o' lie on the front plane (the one closest to the reader), and the endpoints labelled 'u' lie on the back plane (the furthermost from the reader).

We obtain knots from braids via the well-known closing operation adapted to our situation. So, we have:

[formula]

Fig. 5. Closure of a geometric mixed braid.

Note that the strands of Ig do not participate in the closure operation, that's why they are assumed to be infinitely extensible. Besides, the labelling 'u' or 'o' for corresponding endpoints in Definition 4 is precisely an instruction on how to perform the closure. Different choices of labels will yield in general non-isotopic links in Hg, as the example in Fig. 6 illustrates. We return to this example in the discussion before Fig. 19.

[formula]

Fig. 6. Different labels yield non-isotopic links.

[formula]

Fig. 7. The 'under - over' interchange.

Conversely to the closure of braids, mixed links may be braided, so that if we start with a mixed link, do braiding and then take closure, we obtain a mixed link isotopic to the original one. Indeed, we have:

Proof.   We apply the braiding algorithm of [\cite=LR] on a diagram [formula] of the PL mixed link [formula]. By general position [formula] contains no horizontal arcs with respect to the height function. The idea of the braiding is on the one hand to keep the arcs of the diagram that are oriented downwards with respect to the height function, and on the other hand to eliminate the ones that go upwards and produce instead braid strands. We call these arcs opposite arcs. Now, the point is that the subbraid Ig will not be touched by the algorithm, so the opposite arcs will be arcs of the link L. The elimination of the opposite arcs is based on the following: If we run along an opposite arc we are likely to meet a succession of overcrossings and undercrossings. We subdivide (marking with points) every opposite arc into smaller - if necessary - pieces, each containing crossings of only one type; i.e. we may have:

[formula]

Fig. 8.

We call the resulting pieces up-arcs, and we label every up-arc with an 'o' resp. 'u' according as it is the over resp. under arc of a crossing (or some crossings). If it is a free up-arc (one that contains no crossings), then we have a choice whether to label it 'o' or 'u'. The idea is to eliminate the opposite arc by eliminating its up-arcs one by one and create instead a pair of braid strands for each up-arc.

Let now P be the top vertex of the up-arc QP (see Fig. 9). Associated to QP is the sliding triangle T(P), which is a special case of a triangle needed for a Δ-move; it is right-angled with hypotenuse QP and with the right angle lying below the up-arc. Note that, if QP is itself vertical, then T(P) degenerates into the arc QP. We say that a sliding triangle is of type over or under according to the label of the up-arc it is associated with. (This implies that there may be triangles of the same type lying one on top of the other.)

The germ of our braiding process is this. Suppose for definiteness that QP is of type over. Then we cut QP at P and we pull the two ends, the top upwards and the lower downwards, and both over the rest of the diagram, so as to create a pair of corresponding strands of the anticipated braid (see Fig. 9). Finally, we perform a Δ-move across the sliding triangle T(P). By general position the resulting diagram will be regular and QQ' may be assumed to slope slightly downwards. If QP were under then the pulling of the two ends would be under the rest of the diagram. Note that the effect of these two operations has been to replace the up-arc QP by three arcs none of which is an up-arc, and the two of them being corresponding braid strands. Therefore we now have fewer up-arcs.

[formula]

Fig. 9. The germ of the braiding.

For each up-arc that we eliminate, we label the corresponding end strands 'o' or 'u' according to the label of their up-arc. (As already noted, in [\cite=LR] this labelling was not needed.) After eliminating all up-arcs we obtain a geometric mixed braid, denoted [formula] the closure of which is obviously isotopic to [formula]. Indeed, from Definition 5, the closing arc of two corresponding endpoints of the braid is precisely a stretched version of the initial up-arc, since it bears the same label. [formula]

The proof of Theorem 2 is analogous to the one in Section 3 of [\cite=LR]. We have repeated it here for the sake of completion.

Geometric Markov theorem for Hg

As in classical knot theory, the next consideration is how to characterize geometric mixed braids that induce via closure isotopic links in Hg. For this purpose we need to recall the L-moves between braids. These were introduced in [\cite=LR], and they generalize geometrically the Markov moves in the following sense. An Lo-move resp. Lu-move on a braid consists of cutting an arc open and splicing into the broken strand new arcs to the top and bottom, both over resp. under the rest of the braid (see Fig. 10 for the case of Hg). As remarked in [\cite=LR], using a small braid isotopy, a braid L-move can be equivalently seen with a crossing (positive or negative) formed (see Fig. 11 for Hg). Therefore, a geometric Markov move in a braid, that introduces a crossing in the bottom right position, is a special case of an L-move. L-moves and braid isotopy generate an equivalence relation on braids called L-equivalence. It was shown in [\cite=LR] that L-equivalent classes of braids are in bijective correspondence with isotopy classes of oriented links in S3, the bijection being induced by 'closing' the braid. Modified slightly, L-moves in a handlebody are defined as follows.

Let [formula] be a braid in Hg and P a point of an arc of the subbraid B, such that P is not vertically aligned with any crossing. Doing a geometric L-move at P means to perform the following operation: cut the arc at P, bend the two resulting smaller arcs slightly apart by a small isotopy and stretch them vertically, the upper downwards and the lower upwards, and both over or under all other arcs of the diagram, so as to introduce two new corresponding strands with endpoints on the vertical line of P, labelled 'o' or 'u' according to the stretching. Stretching the new strands over will give rise to a geometric Lo-move and under to an geometric Lu-move. Undoing an L-move is defined to be the reverse operation. Also in this set-up, two geometric mixed braids in Hg that differ by an L-move shall be called L-equivalent.

[formula]

Fig. 10. The two types of L-moves in Hg.

Fig. 10 illustrates an example of a geometric Lo-move and a geometric Lu-move at the same point of a geometric mixed braid, whilst Fig. 11 illustrates an abstract geometric Lo-move and the crossing it introduces in the braid box.

[formula]

Fig. 11. An L-move introduces a crossing.

We are now in a position to state the following.

Proof.   Let B denote the braiding map of Theorem 2, let [formula] be a mixed link diagram in Hg, and let [formula]. By Theorem 2,  [formula] is isotopic to [formula]. Further, [formula]. This follows from Definition 5 and from the fact that if we braid the closing arcs of a mixed braid, [formula] say, each closing arc will give rise to one pair of corresponding strands, so we obtain again the braid [formula].

We now consider the liftings [formula] and [formula] of the maps B and C on isotopy classes of link diagrams and on L-equivalent classes of geometric mixed braids respectively. We will show that [formula] is a bijection with inverse [formula]. It follows from Remark 2 that [formula] is well-defined. Thus, from the observations above, it only remains to show that [formula] is also well-defined, that is to show that geometric mixed braids corresponding to isotopic mixed links are L-equivalent. For this we apply the:

Relative Version of Markov theorem (Theorem 4.7 of [\cite=LR])  Let L1, L2 be oriented link diagrams in S3, both containing a common braided portion B. Suppose that there is an isotopy of L1 to L2 which finishes with a homeomorphism fixed on B. Suppose further that B1 and B2 are braids obtained from our braiding process applied to L1 and L2 respectively, both containing the common braided portion B. Then B1 and B2 are L-equivalent by moves that do not affect the braid B.

Here Ig plays the role of the the common subbraid B, which, by Definition 3 and by Theorem 1, remains fixed throughout an isotopy of two mixed link diagrams [formula] and [formula]. Further, the braiding B keeps Ig fixed in the corresponding geometric mixed braids, [formula] and [formula], say. Thus, the relative version of Markov theorem guarantees that [formula] and [formula] are L-equivalent by L-moves that do not affect Ig. But this is precisely the definition of L-moves in Hg (recall Definition 6). The only difference from S3 is that here we attach labels to the corresponding strands of each L-move according to its type. In S3 this was not needed. [formula]

Algebraic versions of Markov theorem

In order to construct invariants of knots in the handlebody using the braid approach we must translate Theorem 3 into algebra (see for example [\cite=J] for S3 and [\cite=L2] for the solid torus). For this we need first to introduce the braid groups Bg,n.

Fig. 12 suggests two ways for depicting abstractly algebraic mixed braids, and it gives a concrete example of an algebraic mixed braid on three strands.

[formula]

Fig. 12. Algebraic mixed braids.

We shall see that an algebraic mixed braid is a special case of a geometric mixed braid. Clearly, it is a special case of an unlabelled geometric mixed braid. We say that an algebraic mixed braid is made geometric if we attach arbitrary labels 'u' or 'o' at its corresponding endpoints. Note that this is an ambiguous process.

[formula]

Fig. 13. Closure of an algebraic mixed braid.

Conversely, geometric mixed braids can be made algebraic. Indeed, the operation 'closure' is an equivalence relation in the set of geometric mixed braids, and we have:

Proof.   Pull each pair of corresponding endpoints of the geometric mixed braid [formula] to the right side of Ig over or under the strands of Ig according to its label, starting from the rightmost pair, and respecting the position of the endpoints. Schematically:

[formula]

Fig. 14. Algebraization of a geometric mixed braid.

We thus obtain unambiguously an algebraic mixed braid. We denote this last step of the braiding algorithm by A, and we say that through A a geometric mixed braid is made algebraic. Now, [formula] is isotopic to the closure of the algebraic mixed braid [formula]. To see this we choose as labels of the algebraic mixed braid [formula] the initial labels of the geometric mixed braid [formula]. Then the closures of the two geometric mixed braids are isotopic, and, by Remark 3 above, the assertion is proved. [formula]

As an example, the algebraization of the two geometric braids of Fig. 6 are illustrated in Fig. 21.

The sets of algebraic mixed braids on n strands, denoted Bg,n, have been treated in [\cite=L3]. It is shown there that these are the underlying braid structures for studying knots in a handlebody, in knot complements and in closed, connected, orientable 3-manifolds. Moreover, they form subgroups of the groups Bg + n with operation the usual concatenation, and with presentation:

[formula]

where the generators of Bg,n may be represented geometrically by:

[formula]

Fig. 15. The generators of Bg,n.

Let [formula] denote the disjoint union of all braid groups Bg,n (not the inductive limit). Proceeding towards the algebraization of Theorem 3 we define:

It follows from Remark 3 that algebraic L-moves do not need the labels 'o' and 'u'. In some illustrations we keep the labels for the sake of clarity. An algebraic L-move in a braid α∈Bg,n has the following algebraic expressions, depending on its type. These are easily derived, as Fig. 16 shows.

Lo-type:   [formula]

Lu-type:   [formula]

[formula]

Fig. 16. Algebraic expression of an algebraic Lo-move.

Proof.   Since the type of a geometric L-move agrees with the label of its endpoints, by pulling the endpoints to the right the crossing of the L-move slides over by a braid isotopy. Schematically:

[formula]

Fig. 17. Sliding a geometric Lo-move to the right.

The case of a geometric Lu-move is completely analogous. Here the pulling takes place under the braid, so the crossing of the geometric Lu-move slides along to the right to form an algebraic Lu-move. [formula]

Now we can state the following:

Proof.  It follows from Theorem 3 and Lemma 2. [formula]

In order to look for Markov functionals on Bg,  ∞, so as to construct link invariants in Hg, we further prove:

Proof.  The two types of moves are illustrated in Figs. 18a and 18b. It is easy to see that both do not leave the isotopy class of the link. In fact, the first one is simply a special case of an algebraic L-move that takes place at the rightmost part of the algebraic mixed braid, whilst the second one clearly induces isotopy via closure, as defined in Definition 8. The other direction is shown by reducing to Theorem 4. Indeed, an algebraic L-move can be realized by a finite sequence of the above moves, as it follows clearly from the algebraic expressions of the two types of algebraic L-moves (recall Fig. 16). [formula]

Algebraic mixed braids that are equivalent in the context of Theorem 4 or Theorem 5 shall be called Markov equivalent. A remark is now in order.

On hidden conjugations

There are two natural questions arising now:

are there any 'hidden' conjugations involving the generators ai, which preserve the isotopy class of the closure of a mixed braid (even though the strands of Ig do not participate in the closure)?

if yes, are all conjugations 'allowed'?

Before answering we need to introduce another notion.

[formula]

Fig. 19. A loop and the two maximal loops.

The answer to the first question is positive. Indeed, we have:

Proof. Fig. 20 demonstrates that, using algebraic L-moves and conjugation by a σ1, the given algebraic mixed braids are Markov equivalent by Theorem 5. Thus their closures are isotopic. [formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Fig. 20. The proof of Lemma 3.

The answer to the second question is negative, as the example below shows: The two algebraic mixed braids of Fig. 21 are the algebraizations of the geometric mixed braids of Fig. 6, thus their closures are the two non-isotopic mixed links of Fig. 6.

[formula]

Fig. 21. Two non-isotopic conjugate algebraic mixed braids.

Now a third question arises:

Can we list all the conjugations that are allowed with respect to isotopy?

In order to answer this question we give first another presentation of the braid group Bg,n with the bi's as generators. This presentation is easily derived from the one with the generators ai given in the previous section using that ai  =  bibi  +  1- 1.

[formula]

It is important to understand that conjugation by some bi of an algebraic mixed braid is equivalent to changing the labels of some pair of corresponding endpoints in a related geometric mixed braid. If, for example, the two corresponding endpoints of the geometric mixed braid lie to the left of all strands of Ig, then by a braid isotopy part of which is absorbed inside the braid box, the geometric mixed braid can look like one of the middle pictures of Fig. 22. Thus, change of labels corresponds to conjugating the algebraization of the 'o' braid (resp. the 'u' braid) by the loop b1 (resp. b1- 1), as Fig. 22 demonstrates.

[formula]

Fig. 22. Conjugation by b1 corresponds to allowed change of labels.

But these conjugations are allowed as we proved in Lemma 3. (To see the isotopy on the level of the geometric mixed braids look at the closing arc of the left middle braid of Fig. 22. This can pass from the 'u' position to the 'o' position without any obstruction from the braid.) Thus, change of labels in this case reflects isotopy between the closures of the two geometric mixed braids.

Let, now, the two corresponding endpoints of a geometric mixed braid lie between the ith and (i + 1)st strand of Ig, for i  ≠  1. Then, with similar reasoning as above, change of labels corresponds to conjugating the 'o' braid (resp. the 'u' braid) by the loop bi + 1 (resp. bi  +  1- 1), see Fig. 23. And conversely, two algebraic mixed braids that are conjugate by a bi, with i  ≠  1, can be seen as the algebraizations of two geometric mixed braids which differ only by the labels of one pair of corresponding endpoints. But such a change of labels does not reflect isotopy. To see this, think of the infinitely extended strands of Ig joining at the point at infinity. Then, the closing arc of the geometric 'u' braid would have to cross the point at infinity in order to come to the 'o' position. Consequently conjugations by the bi's for i  ≠  1 are not allowed, except for some obvious special cases of disconnected diagrams, which would then imply that the knot can also live in a handlebody of smaller genus.

[formula]

Fig. 23. Conjugation by b2 corresponds to non-allowed change of labels.

Finally, the answer to the third question lies in the following result.

Proof. Counter-examples of the required kind exist in the one-strand braid group Bg,1. Indeed, assume the theorem were false, i.e. the closures of β  α  β- 1∈Bg,1 and α∈Bg,1 are isotopic, for all α,  β∈Bg,1 with α a word in the bi's and β some br. From Theorem 4 we know that these two braids are related by braid isotopies and algebraic L-moves. Since Bg,1 is the group generated by the bi's, and this is a free group, β cannot be commuted through α. Hence we have to invoke the L-moves. These introduce some σi's but they do not change the order of the bi's. According to the relations in the braid group, this can only be done if the condition r  ≤  i is satisfied. But this is true always, only if r = 1. Therefore, β has to be b1 or its inverse. Thus, conjugation by br for r  ≥  2 cannot be realized in the generic case. Topologically, this corresponds precisely to crossing the point at infinity discussed above. [formula]

It is crucial for the whole study of braids in a handlebody to note that not all conjugations in the groups Bg,n preserve the isotopy class of the closure of an algebraic mixed braid.

Markov functionals

Theorem 5 opens up the possibility to define invariants of links in the handlebody by algebraic considerations. This runs largely in parallel with the derivation of link invariants in S3 from Markov traces, see for example [\cite=J]. In the handlebody case, however, trace functionals are not appropriate because not all conjugations are allowed, see Theorem 6. Hence, we have to modify the definitions, so as to take this into account.

For an integral domain R  let RBg,n denote the group ring of the handlebody braid group. A Markov functional is an R-linear map

[formula]

for which units [formula] exist such that:

[formula]

Here ι stands for the morphism that embeds Bg,n into Bg,n + 1 by adding an unlinked strand on the right. Moreover, we need the exponent sum of ordinary crossings

Theorem 5 now implies the following:
