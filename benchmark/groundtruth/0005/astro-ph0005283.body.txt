NEW DETREMINATION METHOD OF PRIMORDIAL Li ABUNDANCE

Introduction

Recent spectral and photometric observations of Type Ia supernovae at high redshifts (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999) have raised a possibility that the cosmic expansion is accelerated. For a flat cosmology these data have χ2-minimum around Ω0  ≈  0.3 and ΩΛ  ≈  0.7, allowing Hubble time ~  15Gyr which is not inconsistent with the age of the Milky Way constrained from the observations of the oldest globular clusters.

Cosmological model for primordial nucleosynthesis provides independent method to determine Ω0. The Big-Bang nucleosynthesis model (Copi et al. 1995) predicts 0.04  ≤  Ωbh250  ≤  0.08. Combining this value with X-ray observations of rich clusters that indicate 0.3h- 3 / 250  ≈  Ωb/Ω0 (Bahcall et al. 1995; White et al. 1993), total Ω0 turns out to be Ω0h1 / 250  ≈   0.1~  0.3, which is consistent with flat cosmology.

However, in the determination of Ωb, a difficulty has been imposed by recent detections of a low deuterium abundance, 2.9×  10- 5 ≤   D/H ≤  4.0×  10- 5, in Lyman-α clouds along the line of sight to high red-shift quasars (Burles & Tytler 1998ab). Primordial abundance of 7Li is constrained from the observed "Spite plateau", 0.91×  10- 10 ≤   7Li/H≤  1.91×  10- 10 (Ryan et al. 2000a), and the 4He abundance by mass, 0.226≤  Yp  ≤  0.247 (Olive et al. 1999), from the observations in the HII regions. In order to satisfy these abundance constraints by single Ωb value, one has to assume an appreciable depletion in the observed abundance of 7Li, which is still controversial both theoretically and observationally. We are now forced to critically study the uncertainty. An independent method to determine the primordial 7Li is also desirable.

Primordial Nucleosynthesis

4He vs. D and Neutrino Degeneracy

Shown in Fig. 1 is the comparison between the observed abundance constraints on 4He, D/H, and 7Li/H and the calculated curves in the homogeneous Big-Bang model as a function of η, where η  =  nB / nγ and Ωbh250 = η 1.464×  108. Solid curves display the theoretical prediction of primordial abundances in the standard particle model for neutrino, which preserves the lepton symmetry Lν=0.

There is now a good collection of abundance information on the 4He mass fraction, Yp, in over 50 extragalactic HII regions, from which the upper limit on primordial abundance, Yp  ≤  0.240, and a systematic error, ΔYsys=0.005, were extracted. Unfortunately, for this upper limit one cannot find Ωb to satisfy both abundance constraints on 4He and D/H. (See the solid curves in Fig. 1.)

It has been recognized that ΔYsys may even be larger (Izatov et al. 1994; Thuan 2000), making the upper limit as large as Yp  ≤  0.247. If this upper limit is adopted, the Universe model with η  ≈  5×  10- 10 is marginally consistent with both abundance constraints. However, since even smaller value, Yp=0.235±  0.003, in low-metallicity extragalactic HII regions has been reported by Peimbert & Peimbert (2000), this potential conflict is to be studied more carefully.

One possible solution is to introduce a lepton asymmetry. Theoretically, it is natural to assume that both baryon and lepton symmetries are simultaneously broken, B  ≠  0 and Lν  ≠  0, due to the CP violation in baryogenesis. Lν  ≠  0 is fulfilled by neutrino degeneracy with non-zero ξνe, where ξνe  =  μνe  /  kTν and μνe is the chemical potential of electron neutrino. Since neutrinos had energy density comparable to the densities due to photons and charged leptons in the early Universe, even a small degeneracy 0<  ξνe  ≪  1 leads to an appreciable decrease in the neutron-to-proton number ratio, slightly faster acceleration of the Universal expansion, and a small increase of the weak-decoupling temperature. As a net result, 4He abundance decreases with increasing ξνe, as shown in Fig. 1, while keeping D/H and 7Li/H almost unchanged in logarithmic scale (Kajino & Orito 1998). Since the abundance constraint on primordial 4He is more accurate than the other light elements, this helps determine the most likely ξνe. ξνe  ~  0.05 can best fit the 4He abundance as well as low deuterium abundance D/H~  10- 5, leaving inevitable requirement that the observed abundance level of Spite plateau, 7Li/H~  10- 10, should be the result of depleted primordial abundance.

7Li vs. D

There are several input parameters in the primordial nucleosynthesis calculation. As the number of light neutrino families Nν = 3 and the neutron lifetime τn = 886.7 ±   1.9 s are known, the remaining major uncertainty arises from input nuclear reaction data. We did not take account of the effects of sterile neutrino which is a hypothetical particle for interpreting flavor mixing.

Laboratory cross section measurements ever done provide rather precise thermonuclear reaction rates for the production of D, T, 3He, and 4He. It however was claimed in literature (Smith et al. 1993) that the 7Li abundance is strongly subject to large error bars associated with the measured cross sections for 4He(3H,γ)7Li at [formula] 2×  10- 10 and 4He(3He,γ)7Be at 3[formula]. There are in fact several inconsistent data with one another, leading to large uncertainty in the primordial 7Li, as displayed by long-dash-dotted curves in Fig. 1.

We studied these two reactions very carefully and concluded that the proper 2σ error bars could be 1/4~  1/3 of the previous ones (Kajino et al. 2000). This improvement owes mostly to, first, the new precise measurement (Brune et al. 1994) of the cross sections for 4He(3H,γ)7Li and, second, the systematic theoretical studies of both reaction dynamics and quantum nuclear structures of 7Li and 7Be, whose validity is critically tested by electromagnetic form factors measured by high-energy electron scattering experiments.

When our recommended error estimate is applied to the determination of Ωb in Fig. 1, we lose Ωb value to explain both D/H and 7Li/H simultaneously. If we allow for larger primordial 7Li abundance in Population II halo stars because

of possible lithium depletion for diffusion or rotation-induced mixing of matter (Deliyannis et al. 1998 ; Pinsonneault et al. 1992) or some systematic uncertainty in the model atmospheres (Kurucz 1995), we can recover the concordance. Taking depletion factor ≈   2.5, Ωbh250  ≈   0.075 best fits all abundance constraints in the homogeneous Big-Bang model. Note that larger Ωbh250  ≈   0.2 is allowed in the inhomogeoeus Big-Bang model (Kajino & Orito 1998).

7Li/6Li Ratio in the Interstellar Medium (ISM)

The lithium in the ISM is almost free from the complicated stellar processes. A diffuse cloud along the line of sight to ζOph was observed to show the lithium abundance depleted by 1.58dex from the meteoritic solar-system value 12.3. This is due to dust grain formation (Savage & Sembach 1996). The isotopic ratio is free from such condensation effects and represents the real ratio of chemical compositions in the gas phase. The D/H (Wannier 1980) and 3He/H (Rood et al. 1995) abundance ratios in the ISMs have been observed over wide Galactocentric distance range 0≤  R≤  12kpc and used to constrain the primordial abundance of D/H (Dearborn et al. 1996), but the distribution of 7Li/6Li was poorly known.

Observation

Observations of isotopic abundance ratio, 7Li/6Li, have been performed by several groups (Ferlet & Dennefeld 1983, Lemoine et al. 1993, 1995, Meyer et al. 1993) only for the ISMs in our solar neighborhood. The observed ratio is less than 12.3 and larger than 2.1 which is a predicted GCR abundance ratio.

Using the Coude spectrograph of the 74-inch telescope at Okayama Astrophysical Observatory, Japan, we have succeeded for the first time in the determination of 7Li/6Li in the diffuse cloud along the line of sight to χ2Ori, which is a member of OB association Gem-OB1, being located at R = 10kpc (Kawanomoto et al. 2000). The telescope performance was R=43,000 (with slit width of 100 μm), exp=50hours, and S/N=2,800.

We found a decreasing gradient of 7Li/6Li, as shown in Figs. 2 & 3. It is interpreted as a result of gradual extinction of the stellar production of 7Li.

A New Method to Determine Primordial 7Li

In order to study the sensitivity to the primordial lithium abundance, we have calculated Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) of lithium (Kawanomoto 2000). We adopted a hybrid model (Ryan et al. 2000b) of the inhomogeneous GCE model (Suzuki et al. 1999), which was constructed for the early evolution of metal-deficient stars, being smoothly connected with a simple one-zone GCE model for later evolution. Five different sources of lithium production are included in this model: Primordial nucleosynthesis, GCR interactions with ISM, ν-induced nucleosynthesis in Type II SNe, AGB star nucleosynthesis, and nova nucleosynthesis. We took an approximation that each ring having different Galactocentric distance evolves independently so that the observed present day star-formation-rate and the gas fraction are reproduced very well.

The calculated time variation of 7Li/6Li is shown as a function of R in Fig. 2. Remarkable decrease of 7Li/6Li in the inner region is caused by faster gas consumption for the star formation. It is discussed in literature that the meteoretic chemical compositions are peculier and different from those of ISM because they were possibly polluted by nearby AGB star. One might speculate another possibility that the solar-system might ever have moved outward over hundreds of turns of the Galactic disc, keeping high 7Li/6Li = 12.3 as it was in the original position when the solar system was isolated from viscous gas component at [formula]Gyr.

Figure 3 displays sensitivity of the 7Li/6Li ratio at the present time tG=12Gyr to the primordial abundance of 7Li. It is very sensitive to 7Lip. Except for old data point at ρ-Oph (Ferlet & Dennefeld 1983), which has the largest error bar among all data for the solar neighborhood, the observed ratios look more consistent with 7Lip = (1.4~  3.5)×  10- 10 than 7Lip = 1.5×  10- 9. More data with smaller error bars are highly desirable in order to convince the gradient of the 7Li/6Li ratio and to determine the primordial abundance of 7Li in this method.
