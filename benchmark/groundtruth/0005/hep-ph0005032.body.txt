Higgs Model without Elementary Scalars

A model of interaction of massless vector and spinor fields is considered. With the use of Bogolyubov quasi-average method we study a possibility of a dynamical breaking of the initial symmetry. Assuming the existence of effective cut-off Λ, we show, that there exists a solution, which breaks gauge symmetry of the theory. Instead of Higgs scalars fermion-antifermion tachion bound states are present here. As a result we have a theory with a massive vector field, a massive spinor and a composite scalar.

The widely popular Higgs mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking needs initial scalar fields, which look rather less attractive, than the well-known gauge interactions of vector and spinor fields. Experimental facilities now approach the region of possible discovery of the Higgs. In view of these considerations it may be useful to study once more possibilities, which differ from the standard Higgs mechanism.

In the present note we consider a model, which might serve a substitute for the famous simple Higgs model [\cite=Higgs]. So, we consider U(1) massless gauge field Aμ and also massless spinor field ψ, which interact in the followig way

[formula]

where as usually

[formula]

Of course, the interesting possibility is the symmetric one

[formula]

but we here take the general case and will not discuss the problem of the triangle axial anomaly, bearing in mind that in a more realistic model one always can arrange cancellation of the anomalies by a suitable choice of fermions' charges, in the same way as it occurs in the Standard Model.

Now we start to apply Bogolyubov quasi-average method [\cite=Bog]. In view of looking for symmetry breaking we add to ([\ref=init]) additional term

[formula]

Now let us consider the theory with ε  ≠  0, calculate necessary quantities (averages) and only at this stage take limit ε  →  0. In this limit, according [\cite=Bog], we come to quasi-averages, which not always coincide with the corresponding averages, which one obtains directly from the initial Lagrangian ([\ref=init]).

Because of additional term ([\ref=eRL]) the following vertices inevitably appear

[formula]

These vertices should have form-factors, which define effective cut-off Λ. The origin of the cut-off is connected with (quite possible) self-consistent solution of the corresponding dynamical equations. Examples of such equations shows, that there appear decreasing functions of momentum variables, e.g. p2, of the form (see, e.g. [\cite=AF])

[formula]

where γ,  ρ are some numbers, usually fractional, and x denote typical dimensional constant, appearing in the model (in our case it may be some combination of x,  y,  z ([\ref=psi])). So we would expect Λ to be of the order of magnitude of 1 / x,  1 / y,  1 / z. In any case, in our model we use some fixed cut-off value Λ. The model works in the region of momentum variables much less,than the cut-off: |p2|  ≪  Λ2.

We consider compensation equations [\cite=Bog] [\cite=Bog2] (in other words, gap equations) for x,  y,  z in one-loop approximation and obtain following set of equations

[formula]

Vector boson exchange corrections are calculated in Landau gauge. Here [formula] is the largest of two would-be masses: that of the gauge boson M and the spinor one m. As we shall see relation M    ≪    m    ≪    Λ is natural in the model, so in the following we assume   =  m. Let X,  Y,  Z be dimensionless variables

[formula]

We shall consider charges ei to be small enough, so let us first solve set ([\ref=set]) for ei  =  0. At this stage we also set ε  →  0. There is, of course, trivial solution x    =    y    =    z    =    0  . In addition we have two nontrivial solutions.

[formula]

As we shall see further, just the second solution ([\ref=2]) will be the most interesting. In this case it is important to take into account e2 terms in set ([\ref=set]). Considering these terms as small perturbations, we obtain for the second solution ([\ref=2])

[formula]

Expressions for ΔY,  ΔZ will be of no use in our discussion.

Now let us consider scalar bound states (LψR,  RψL). Without e2 corrections we have from Bethe-Salpeter equation in one-loop approximation

[formula]

where g    =    const is just the Bethe-Salpeter wave function. Here k2 is the scalar state Euclidean momentum squared, that is k2  >  0 means tachion mass of the scalar. Function F(ξ) decreases from the value F(0)  =  1 with ξ increasing. We see, that for solution ([\ref=2]) we have bound state with k2  =  0 in full correspondence with Bogolyubov-Goldstone theorem [\cite=Bog2], [\cite=Gold]. As for the first solution ([\ref=1]), there is no solution of Eq. ([\ref=eq0]) at all. So in the present note we concentrate our attention on the solution ([\ref=2]). Note, that there is an additional argument in favour of solution ([\ref=2]). Namely, values X and especially Y,  Z are small enough, so we may expect, that many-loop terms will not influence results strongly.

Now let us take into account vector boson corrections. Equation for the bound state ([\ref=eq0]) is modified due to two sources. The first one corresponds to modified expression ([\ref=delta]). The second one consists in loop e2 corrections to Eq. ([\ref=eq0]). In Landau gauge there are only two nonzero such one-loop diagrams: the triangle one and the self-energy of the scalar. Scalar R  ψL has evidently charge eL - eR. Then we have

[formula]

We see, that for small eL,  eR possible eigenvalues ξ are also small. Then we have following condition for an eigenvalue

[formula]

The first point to be checked is the consequence of the Bogolyubov-Goldstone theorem, that is the zero mass eigenstate for symmetric case ([\ref=ee]). We would expect, that substitution of values ([\ref=ee]) into ([\ref=eigen]) gives cancellation of all e2 terms and thus leads to zero-mass eigenstate. In fact, there are large terms with opposite signs, but we do not obtain full cancellation. Of course we have no doubt in validity of the theorem. The additional terms, which reduce the corresponding coefficient afore e2 to zero, are connected with many-loop diagrams (one vector boson loop and other with interactions ([\ref=psi])). We see, that some 7 -8 % change in coefficients in f(eL,  eR) reduce it to square of (eL  -  eR). So we assume, that accuracy of our simplified one-loop calculations correspond to these values and it is at least not more than 10%. We have already noted, that such accuracy is natural for solution ([\ref=2]). Thus for qualitative discussion of the model we shall use the simple one-loop approximation.

Let us consider again equation ([\ref=eigen]) for scalar bound state. We see, that there is tachion bound state in case e2 contribution being positive. Really, the eigenvalue condition for small e2i reads

[formula]

Here we keep main logarithmic terms. Thus provided f(eL,  eR)  >  0 we have scalar complex tachion φ with negative mass squared -    m20.

We have the following vertices of interaction of φ with spinors

[formula]

We normalize g by demanding the charge of φ to be eL  -  eR (again in one-loop approximation). This gives

[formula]

Then we calculate box diagram with four scalar legs. This gives us effective constant λ, which enters into additional term

[formula]

Now we come to the usual Higgs model [\cite=Higgs] with m20 ([\ref=m0]), λ  ([\ref=lam]) and φ charge eL    -    eR.

Thus from expressions ([\ref=m0], [\ref=lam]) we have usual vacuum average of [formula]

[formula]

The vector boson mass duly arises and it reads as follows

[formula]

Interaction ([\ref=fint]) leads to spinor mass m

[formula]

Thus, we obtain the result, that initially massless model of interaction of a spinor with a vector becomes after the symmetry breaking just a close analog of the Higgs model. We have now vector boson mass ([\ref=M]), spinor mass  ([\ref=m]) and a scalar bound state with mass [formula],

[formula]

The result is expressed in terms of parameters eL,  eR. If we take parameters

[formula]

to be small enough, relation M    ≪    m    ≪    Λ is justified. Note interesting relation between mH and m

[formula]

Due to relation ([\ref=m])

[formula]

so, all masses are proportional to cut-off Λ. In addition to relation ([\ref=mHm]) we have following relations, which for the sake of simplicity we present here for antisymmetric case eL    =      -    eR    =    e  ,  αL  =  αR  =  α

[formula]

We may consider the energy density of the scalar field

[formula]

A minimum of this function could fix the stable variant of the model. These considerations may help in application of the present method to more realistic electroweak models.

We would formulate qualitative result of the work as follows: in the massless model with Lagrangian ([\ref=init]) with eL  ≠  eR there arises fermion-antifermion condensate, which defines masses M,  m,  mH according to ([\ref=mHm], [\ref=ratio]).

Note, that variants of dynamical breaking of the electroweak symmetry without elementary scalars were considered in various aspects (see, e.g. paper [\cite=Arb]). The possibility scalars being composed of fundamental spinors was considered e.g. in well-known paper [\cite=Ter].
