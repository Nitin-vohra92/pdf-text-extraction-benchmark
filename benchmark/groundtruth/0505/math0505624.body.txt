Introduction

A finite graph is called an expander if for any (not too big) set of vertices there are many edges leaving this set. This implies that expander graphs are highly connected and have a small diameter. Such graphs have many practical applications, for example in construction of computer networks.

Using simple counting arguments it can be shown that the random k-regular graphs are expanders for k  ≥  5. However these expanders are not sufficient for many applications where one needs explicit families of expander graphs. Constructing such examples is a difficult problem.

A natural candidate for a family of expanders are the Cayley graphs C(Gi,Si) of a sequence of finite groups Gi with respect to some (suitably chosen) generating sets Si. It is known that if there is a uniform bound for the size of the generating sets Si then the expanding properties of the Cayley graphs are related to the representation theory of the groups Gi, more specifically to their Kazhdan constants.

Using this connection G. Margulis in [\cite=Mar] gave the first explicit construction of a family of expanders, using the Kazhdan property T of [formula]. Currently there are several different constructions of expanders using the representation theory of infinite groups -- typically one finds a finitely generated infinite group G with a 'nice' representation theory (usually the group has some variant of property T, property τ, Selberg property etc.). In this case the Cayley graphs of (some) finite quotients Gi of G with respect to the images of a generating set S of the big group form an expander family. It is very interesting to ask when can one do the opposite -- which leads to the following difficult problem (see [\cite=lu]):

Let Gi be an infinite family of finite groups. Is it possible to make their Cayley graphs expanders using suitably chosen generating sets?

Currently there is no theory which can give a satisfactory answer to this question. The answer is known only in a few special cases: If the family of finite groups comes from a finitely generated infinite group with property T (or its weaker versions) then the answer is YES. Also if all groups in the family are "almost" abelian then the answer is NO (see [\cite=lubwiess]) and this is essentially the only case where a negative answer of Problem [\ref=makexp] is known.

A natural family of groups which are sufficiently far from abelian is the family of all symmetric groups. The special case of Problem [\ref=makexp] for the symmetric groups, i.e., the existence of a generating sets which make thier Cayley graphs expanders, is an old open question which has been asked several times in the literature, see [\cite=BHKLS] [\cite=expanderbook] [\cite=lu] [\cite=LubZuk].

The asymptotic as n  →    ∞   of Kazhdan constant of the symmetric group [formula] with respect to some natural generating sets are known, see [\cite=BaHarpe]. Unfortunately in all known examples the Kazhdan constant goes to zero as the size of the symmetric groups increase (even though in many cases the sizes of the generating sets are not bounded), which suggest that Problem [\ref=makexp] has a negative answer for the family of all symmetric groups.

On the other hand the symmetric group [formula] can be viewed as a general linear group over "the field" with one element, see [\cite=J2]. In [\cite=KSL3k], it is shown that the Cayley graphs of [formula] for any prime p and infinitely many n can be made expanders simultaneously by choosing a suitable generating sets. Using the previous remark this presents a strong supporting evidence that Problem [\ref=makexp] has a positive answer.

The main result of this paper answers affirmatively Problem [\ref=makexp] in the case of alternating/symmetric groups.

For all n there exists an explicit generating set Sn (of size at most L) of the alternating group [formula], such that the Cayley graphs [formula] form a family of ε-expanders. Here, L and ε > 0 are some universal constants.

The proof uses the equivalence between family of expanders and groups with uniformly bounded Kazhdan constant s. Using bounded generation and relative Kazhdan constant of some small groups, we can obtain lower bounds for the Kazhdan constant s of the symmetric groups [formula] with respect to several different generating sets. All these estimates relay on Theorem [\ref=altexp6], whose proof uses upper bounds for the characters of the symmetric group and estimates of the mixing time of random walks.

Theorem [\ref=main] has many interesting applications: First, it provides one of the few constructions of an expander family of Cayley graphs C(Gi,Si) such that the groups Gi are not obtained as quotients of some infinite group having a variant of Kazhdan property T. The other constructions which do not use a variant of property T are based on an entirely different idea -- the so called 'zig-zag' product of graphs, for details see [\cite=ALW] [\cite=MW] [\cite=RVW] [\cite=RSW].

Second, the automorphism groups of the free group [formula] can be mapped onto infinitely many alternating groups, see [\cite=Gilman]. This, together with Theorem [\ref=main] provides a strong supporting evidence for the conjecture that [formula] and [formula] have property τ. This conjecture if correct, will imply that the product replacement algorithm has a logarithmic mixing time, see [\cite=LP] for details.

Third, Theorem [\ref=main] implies that for a fixed C, the expanding constant of [formula] with respect to the set SCn is large enough. The size of the set SCn is independent on n, and if n is sufficiently large then |SCn|  <  10- 30n1 / 30. The last inequality allows us to use the expander [formula] as a 'seed' graph for recursive construction of expanders suggested by E. Rozenman, A. Shalev and A. Widgerson in [\cite=RSW]. This will be one of the few constructions of an infinite family of expander graphs which are purely combinatorial, i.e., it does not use any representation theory. This construction produces a family of expander graphs from the automorphism groups of n-regular rooted tree of depth k. A slight modification of this construction gives another recursive expander family based on [formula] for fixed large n and different k-s.

Theorem [\ref=main] implies the analogous result for the symmetric groups:

For all n there exists an explicit generating set S̃n (of size at most L) of the alternating group [formula], such that the Cayley graphs [formula] form a family of ε-expanders. Here L and ε > 0 are some universal constants.

Theorem [\ref=mainsym] implies that the random walk on [formula], generated by S̃n has mixing time approximately [formula] steps. This leads to a natural and fast algorithm for generating pseudo-random permutations. There are others algorithms which generate a random permutations in [formula] in n log n steps; however they usually require generating a random number from 1 to n on each step.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section [\ref=outline] contains definitions and a sketch of the proof of Theorem [\ref=altexp6], which is a weaker version of Theorem [\ref=main]. The detailed proof of this theorem is contained in Sections [\ref=relT] and [\ref=cube]. Section [\ref=proofmain] explains how Theorems [\ref=main] and [\ref=mainsym] can be derived from Theorem [\ref=altexp6]. Section [\ref=comments] concludes the paper with some comments about possible modifications and applications of Theorem [\ref=main].

Outline

Let us start with one of the equivalent definitions of expander graphs:

A finite graph Γ is called an ε-expander for some ε∈(0,1) if for any subset A  ⊆  Γ of size at most |Γ| / 2 we have |∂(A)|  >  ε|A|. Here ∂(A) is the set of vertices of [formula] of edge distance 1 to A. The largest such ε is called the expanding constant of Γ.

Constructing families of ε-expanders with a large expanding constant ε and bounded valency is an important practical problem in computer science, because the expanders can be used to construct concentrators, super concentrators, contractors and etc. For an excellent introduction to the subject we refer the reader to the book [\cite=expanderbook] by A. Lubotzky and to [\cite=Kl].

If we consider only graphs Γi were the degree of each vertex is at most k, then all graphs Γi are ε-expanders for some ε, if any of the following equivalent conditions holds:

The Chegeer constants of Γi are uniformly bounded away from zero;

The Laplacian of Γi have a uniformly bounded spectral gap;

In this case we also have that the lazy random walk on the graph Γi mixes in O( log |Γi|) steps.

The graphs which appear in many applications arise from finite groups -- they are Cayley with respect to some generating set or their quotients. In that case we have an additional equivalent condition -- the Cayley graphs C(Gi;Si) of Gi, with respect to generating sets Si are ε-expanders for some ε if and only if the Kazhdan constants K(Gi;Si) are uniformly bounded away from zero.

The original definition of Kazhdan property T uses the Fell topology of the unitary dual of a group, see [\cite=kazhdan]. We are interested not only in property T, which automatically holds for any finite group, but also in the related notion of Kazhdan constant s. The following definitions, which addresses the notion of the Kazhdan constant s, are equivalent to the usual definitions of relative property T and property T.

Let G be a discrete group generated by a finite set S and let H be a subset of G. Then the pair (G,H) has relative property T if there exists ε > 0 such that for every unitary representation ρ: G  →  U(H) on a Hilbert space H without H invariant vectors and every vector [formula] there is some s∈S such that ||ρ(s)v - v|| > ε||v||. The largest ε with this property is called the relative Kazhdan constant for (G,H) with respect to the set S and is denoted by K(G,H;S).

The group G has Kazhdan property T if the pair (G,G) has relative T and the Kazhdan constant for the group G is K(G;S): = K(G,G;S).

The property T depends only on the group G and does not depend on the choice of the generating set S, however the Kazhdan constant depends also on the generating set.

It is clear that any finite group G has property T, because it has only finitely representations generated by a single vector. If the generating set S contains all elements of the group G, then we have the inequalities

[formula]

This follows from the following observation: if a unit vector v∈H is moved by at most [formula] by any element of the group G, then the whole orbit Gv is contained in some half space and its center of mass is not zero. The G invariance of the orbit gives that the center of mass is a non-zero G-invariant vector in H. However the resulting Cayley graphs are complete graphs with |G| vertices and very 'expensive' expanders.

Some estimates for Kazhdan constant of the symmetric groups with respect to some generating sets are known -- from [\cite=Ro1] it follows that

[formula]

where Tk,n is the set of all permutations with less that k non-fixed points. This implies that the Cayley graphs [formula] are not expanders if [formula]. The size of the generating set T(k,n) in this case is [formula]. We must mention that so far explicit expanding generating sets of the symmetric group which are significantly smaller then the symmetric group itself, are not known -- the size of the smallest one is around [formula], in [\cite=Ro1] it is shown that [formula] have some expanding properties if [formula].

On the other hand, it is known that the Cayley graphs [formula] are expanders if R is a random generating set of size n log n. This follows form a general result, known as Alon-Roichman Theorem [\cite=AR] (see also [\cite=LR] and [\cite=LS]), valid for all finite groups. This result is the best possible in the class of all finite groups, however it is believed that in the case of the symmetric group the bound n log n can be improved significantly.

As mention before to prove Theorem [\ref=main], it is enough to prove that there exist generating sets, the Kazhdan constant s of which are uniformly bounded away from 0. We will start with a similar result for [formula] for a fixed n  ≥  3, which also proves that [formula] has property T and gives an estimate for the Kazhdan constant  with respect to the generating set consisting of the elementary matrices.

The standard proofs of property T for arithmetic groups, like [formula], use the representation theory of Lie groups and are not quantitative, i.e., they do not lead to any estimate of the Kazhdan constant s. Our approach is based on ideas from [\cite=YSh]: we start with the trivial estimate

[formula]

and will make several changes of the initial generating set [formula], which will decrease its size and keep some estimate of the Kazhdan constant. Finally we will end with a generating Sn,p of size independent on p such that [formula] is bounded away from 0.

There are two propositions which allow us to estimate the Kazhdan constant  if we change the generating set. The first one is a quantitative version of the fact that property T for a discrete group does not depend on the generating set.

Let S and S' be two finite generating sets of a group G, such that S'  ⊂  Sk, i.e., all the elements of S' can be written as short products of elements form S. Then we have

[formula]

If v is an ε almost invariant vector for the set S then

[formula]

This shows that v is kε almost invariant vector for the set Sk and in particular for S'. If we start with [formula] then v is K(G;S') almost invariant vector for S', which gives the existence of nonzero invariant vectors in H.

The second proposition uses relative property T to enlarge the generating set by adding a subgroup to it:

If H is a normal subgroup of a group G generated by a set S then:

[formula]

Let ρ:G  →  U(H) is a unitary representation and let v be ε almost invariant vector for the set S. We can write [formula], where H|| is the space of all H invariant vectors in H and [formula] is its orthogonal complement. These spaces are G-invariant because H is a normal subgroup. This decomposition gives [formula], where both components are ε-almost invariant vectors. However there are no H invariant vectors in [formula] and relative property T of (G,H) implies

[formula]

for some s∈S, which implies that [formula] Thus, for any h∈H we have

[formula]

If we start with [formula] than the above inequality gives that v is [formula]-almost invariant for both H and S therefore there exists an invariant vector in H.

In practice one often uses a variant of this proposition for several subgroup Hi simultaneously.

a) Let Hi and Ni be subgroups of a group G such that [formula] and Ni is generated by Si. If K(Ni,Hi;Si)  ≥  α and Si  ⊂  S for all i then

[formula]

b) Let N be a group generated by a set [formula] and let [formula]. If πi are homomorphisms from N in a group G, then

[formula]

Using these simple propositions Y. Shalom [\cite=YSh] was able to estimate the Kazhdan constant of [formula] with respect to the set S of all elementary matrices with ±  1 off the diagonal. Let EMi,j denote the subgroup of elementary matrices of the form [formula] and let [formula].

The relative Kazhdan constant of the pair [formula] was estimated by Burger [\cite=Bur], see also [\cite=GG2], to be:

[formula]

where [formula] is the set consisting of the 4 elementary matrices in [formula] together with the standard basis vectors of [formula] and their inverses. The proof is a quantitative version of the fact that there are only a few [formula] invariant measures on the torus [formula].

Using embeddings πi,j of [formula] in [formula] such that the image of [formula] under πi,j contains Ei,j, by Proposition [\ref=relKC] we have

[formula]

The next step in the proof uses bounded generation of [formula] with respect to the set of the elementary matrices. This implies that

[formula]

where [formula].

Combining these two inequalities one obtains a lower bound for the Kazhdan constant

[formula]

In particular, this implies that there is a bound for the Kazhdan constant s [formula] which is independent on p, implying that the Cayley graphs [formula] of the finite groups [formula] are expanders.

Using relative property T of the pair [formula] for finitely generated noncommutative rings R, the Cayley graphs of [formula] for any prime power q and infinitely many n can be made expanders simultaneously by choosing a suitable generating set, see [\cite=KSL3k]. An important building block in this construction is that the group [formula] can be written as a product of 20 abelian subgroups and this number is independent on n and q.

These methods can not be applied to the symmetric/alternating groups. Most of the estimates for the relative Kazhdan constant K(G,H;S) use that there are no invariant measures on the dual Ĥ of the group H under the action of the normalizer of H in G. The quantitative versions of this fact are known only if Ĥ is well understood, which is the case only if the subgroup H is (or is very close to) an abelian subgroup.

If we start with finite generating sets Sn of bounded size of the alternating groups [formula], then we can find only finitely many abelian groups Hα (the number depending only on the size of the generating set Sn) such that the relative Kazhdan constant s can be estimated easily. Thus would allow us to bound [formula] with [formula], where En is a union of a bounded number of abelian subgroups. We can use Proposition [\ref=KCball] to estimate [formula] if [formula] for some k, i.e., if each alternating group [formula] is a product of a fixed number of abelian subgroups.

However, the finite symmetric/alternating groups do not have this property -- the size of [formula] or [formula] is approximately nn and every abelian subgroup has no more than 2n elements, thus one needs at least ln n subgroups. This suggests that [formula] are "further from the abelian groups" than all other finite simple groups, and therefore they should have more expanding properties. Unfortunately, this also significantly complicates the construction of expanders based on the alternating groups, because the above method can not be applied without significant modifications.

The main idea of the proof of Theorem [\ref=main] is a modification of the above method -- the difference is that we are looking for a set En, which is a union of finitely many abelian subgroups in [formula], such that the Kazhdan constant s [formula] are uniformly bounded, even though there is no k such that [formula] for all n. There is a natural construction of the set En if n has a specific form. If n = (23s - 1)6 for some s, we shall construct a group Δ generated by a set S̄ and an abelian subgroup Γ in it, such that the relative Kazhdan constant s K(Δ,Γ;S̄) are bounded away from 0. There are several natural embeddings [formula] and the Kazhdan constant [formula] can be estimated. These two bounds give us a bound for [formula], which will prove the following:

If N = (23s - 1)6 for some s  >  6 there exists a generating set SN (of size at most 200) of the alternating group [formula], such that the Cayley graphs [formula] form a family of ε-expanders. Here ε is a universal constant.

Sketch of the proof of Theorem [\ref=altexp6]. This sketch explains the main idea of the proof -- the complete proof is in Sections [\ref=relT] and [\ref=cube]. We will think that the alternating group [formula] acts on a set of N points which are arranged into d = 6 dimensional cube of size K = 23s - 1. The group Γ is a direct product of Kd - 1 = K5 cyclic groups of order K. This group can be embedded in [formula] in d different ways as follows: the image of each cyclic group in Γ under πi permutes the points on a line, parallel to the i-th coordinate axis. An other way to think about Ei  =  πi(Γ) is as part of the subgroup of [formula] which preserves all coordinates but the i-th one.

The group Γ can be embedded in a group Δ generated by a set [formula], such that the embeddings πi can be extended to Δ. The group Δ is a product of many copies of [formula] and can be viewed as [formula], where the ring R is a product of many copies of the matrix ring [formula]. An important observation is that the ring R has a generating set whose size is independent on s. Using results from [\cite=KSL3k], mainly the relative Kazhdan constant

[formula]

for some set F. This allows us to obtain an estimate for K(Δ;S̄)

[formula]

and to compare [formula] and [formula].

We will finish the proof of Theorem [\ref=altexp6] using Theorem [\ref=KCGammas] from Section [\ref=cube], which gives us that

[formula]

where Ei  =  πi(Γ), provided that s  >  6. The proof of this inequality uses directly the representation theory of the alternating group. Let ρ be a unitary representation of [formula] in a Hilbert space H and let v∈H be ε-almost invariant vector with respect to the set E. We want to prove that if ε  <  1 / 70 then H contains an invariant vector.

First, we will split the representation ρ into two components -- one corresponding to partitions λ with λ1  <  N  -  h and a second one, containing all other partitions (here h depends on N and will be determined later). This decomposition of the representation ρ into two components H1 and H2, using the first part of the partition λ borrows ideas from [\cite=Ro1]. There, Y. Roichman uses a similar argument to show that the Cayley graphs of the alternating group with respect to a conjugancy class with a large number of non-fixed points have certain expanding properties.

First we shall prove that the projection v1 of the vector v in the first component H1 is small provided that h  ≫  K ln K. It can be shown that for a fixed k the ball Ek almost contains an entire conjugancy class C containing all cycles of length approximately Kd - 1 / 3 ln K. Using estimates for the values of characters of the symmetric group we can show that if h  ≫  K ln K then

[formula]

The vectors v and v1 are almost invariant with respect to the set [formula] and therefore with respect to C. This implies that

[formula]

The two inequalities gives that ||v1||  ≤  47ε  +  0.07.

That projection v2 of v in the second component H2 is close to an invariant vector if h  <  Kd / 4. Here the idea is that the space H2 can be embedded into a vector space with a basis B consisting all ordered tuples of size h. It can be shown that the mixing time of the random walk on the set B, generated by E has a small mixing time -- this is possible in part because |E|  ≫  |B|, but the proof uses the specific structure of the set E. This implies that the vector

[formula]

is very close to some invariant vector v0. On the other hand this vector is close to v2, therefore

[formula]

Equations ([\ref=h1o]) and ([\ref=h2o]) were obtained using the assumptions h  ≫  K ln K and h  <  Kd / 4 -- these restrictions can be satisfied only if Kd / 4  ≫  K ln K, i.e., d > 4. In order to simplify the argument we require that d is even, which justifies our choice of d = 6 and N = K6. In this case, h have to satisfy the inequalities K ln K  ≪  h  <  K3 / 2, therefore we chose [formula] and define H1 to be the sub-representation of H corresponding to all partitions with [formula].

Equations ([\ref=h1]) and ([\ref=h2]) give us that

[formula]

In particular this implies that [formula] if ε is small enough and the representation H contains an invariant vector and finishes the proof of Theorem [\ref=KCGammas].

Finally equations ([\ref=KCGamma]) and ([\ref=KCSym]) together with proposition [\ref=relKC] imply that

[formula]

which completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=altexp6] modulo the results in Sections [\ref=relT] and [\ref=cube]. In section [\ref=proofmain], we derive Theorems [\ref=main] and [\ref=mainsym] from Theorem [\ref=altexp6].

The groups Γ and Δ

As mention before, we will think that the alternating group [formula] acts on a set of N points which are arranged into d = 6 dimensional cube of size K = 23s - 1 and we will identify these points with ordered 6-tuples of nonzero elements from the field [formula]. For the rest of this section we will assume that s, K and N are fixed and that s > 6. For any associative ring R, [formula] denotes the subgroup of the 3  ×  3 invertible matrices with entries in R, generated by all elementary matrices.

Let H denote the group [formula]. The group H has a natural action on the set [formula] of K nonzero elements of a vector space V of dimension 3s over [formula]. The elements of H act by even permutations on [formula], because H is a finite simple group and does not have [formula] as a factor.

We can identify V with the filed [formula] -- the existence of a generator for the multiplicative group of [formula] implies that some element of [formula] acts as a K-cycle on [formula]. We have the equality [formula], because we work over a field characteristic 2. This requirement is not necessary and can be avoided if we modify the proof of Theorem [\ref=KCGammas] for other possible choices of the group H, which also give bounded degree expanders in infinitely many alternating groups see Section [\ref=comments].

Let Δ be the direct product of Kd - 1 copies of the group H. The group Δ can be embedded into [formula] in 6 different ways which we denote by πi, [formula]. The image of each copy of H under πi acts as [formula] on a set of K = 23s - 1 points where all coordinates but the ith one are fixed. The existence of an element of order K in H implies that Δ contains an abelian subgroup Γ isomorphic to [formula].

Another way to think of this group is as follows -- Δ is a product of copies of [formula], i.e.,

[formula]

i.e., [formula] where R denotes the product of Kd - 1 copies of the matrix ring [formula].

For any s the ring R is generated by 2  +  ⌈3(d - 1) / s⌉  ≤  5 elements.

The matrix algebra [formula] can be generated as a ring by 1 and two elements [formula] and [formula], for example we can take  = e2,1 and [formula]. By construction, the ring R is

[formula]

We can think that the copies of [formula] are indexed by tuples of length

[formula]

of elements in [formula]. Let us define the elements α, β and γi, [formula] in [formula] as follows: All components of α and β are equal to [formula] and [formula], the components of γi in the copy of [formula] index by [formula] is equal to pi. It is no difficult to show that the elements α, β and γi generate [formula] as associative ring.

Any generating set of a ring R gives a generating set of the group [formula]:

For any s the group Δ can be generated a by set S̄ consisting of [formula] involutions (elementary matrices in [formula]).

Using the definition of [formula] we can see that if the ring R is generated by αk then the group [formula] is generated by the set

[formula]

The set S̄ consists of involutions because the ring R has characteristic 2.

Actually the group Δ can be generated by only 10 involutions.

The main result in this section is:

The Kazhdan constant of the group Δ with respect to the set S̄ is

[formula]

The proof uses bounded generation of [formula] and the following Theorem 2.2 from [\cite=KSL3k] (see also Theorem 3.4 in [\cite=YSh]):

Let R be an associative ring generated by [formula]. Let F1 be set of 4(t + 1) elementary matrices in [formula] with ±  1 and ±  αi off the diagonal and F2 be the set of standard basis vectors in R2 and their inverses. Then the relative Kazhdan constant of the pair [formula] is

[formula]

This is only a short sketch of proof, for details the reader is referred to [\cite=KSL3k] or [\cite=YSh] in the case of commutative ring. With out loss of generality we may assume that the ring R is the free associative ring generated by αi. For any unitary representation [formula] and a unit vector v∈H we can construct a measure μv on the dual [formula].

If the vector v is an almost invariant under the set F1 then we have

[formula]

for any Borel set B  ⊂   and any g∈F1. This show that μv is almost invariant measure on [formula]. The vector v is almost invariant for F2 therefore μv(Bi)  ≪  1 for some specific Borel sets Bi. It is known that there are only few [formula] invariant measures on [formula] and almost all of them give large measures to the sets Bi. It can be shown that the above inequalities imply that μ({0}) > 0. By definition μ({0}) is square of the length of the projection of v onto the subspace of H invariant vectors. Thus μ({0}) > 0 implies the existence of H invariant vectors in H.

Using 6 different embeddings of [formula] into [formula] we can obtain the following implication of the above theorem:

[formula]

where GEM is the set of all generalized elementary matrices in [formula], i.e., the set of all matrices of the form

[formula]

up to permuting the rows and the columns.

Any element g from the group Δ can be written as a product of 17 elements from the GEM, i.e., we have Δ  =  GEM17.

Let [formula]. With three additional left multiplications by GEMs we can transform g to a 3  ×  3 block matrix where the last column is trivial, with an extra 3 left multiplications by GEMs we can make the second column trivial. Finally with one GEM we can transform g to a matrix which differs form the identity only in the top-left corner, i.e., we have:

[formula]

The entry in the top-left corner is an element in [formula] and thus is a group commutator of two invertible elements in R. As such it can be written as a product of 10 generalized elementary matrices in [formula]. This shows that every matrix in [formula] can be written as a product of 17 generalized elementary matrices which are in the set GEM.

This proof works only for finite rings R, which have the property that any element in

[formula]

This together with proposition [\ref=KCball] implies

We have

[formula]

The above corollary together with equation ([\ref=relKC1]) imply

[formula]

which finishes the proof of Theorem [\ref=KCdelta].

Using the embedding πi and proposition [\ref=relKC] we obtain:

[formula]

Representations of [formula]

In this section we will use the same notation as in Section [\ref=relT]: Let N = Kd for some odd K and d = 6. We will think that [formula] acts on the points in a d dimensional cube of size K. Let Γ denote the group [formula]. The group Γ has d embeddings πi in [formula]. The image of each cyclic subgroup under πi shifts the points on some line parallel to the i-th coordinate axis. Let Ei  =  πi(Γ) denote the images of Γ and let E be the union

[formula]

The main result in this section is the following:

The Kazhdan constant of [formula] with respect to the set E satisfies

[formula]

provided that K is odd and K > 106.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=KCGammas] gives that

[formula]

and the proof of this statement is slightly easier because we can ignore many terms which tend to 0 as K  →    ∞  . If K  ≪  106 this method give very weak bounds for the Kazhdan constant, however we believe that Theorem [\ref=KCGammas] also holds for small K.

Let [formula] be a unitary representation of the alternating group, and let v∈H be ε-almost invariant unit vector for the set E. We will show that H contains an invariant vector if ε is small enough. Without loss of generality we may assume that H is generated by v as an [formula] module.

The irreducible representations of the symmetric group [formula] are parameterized by the partitions λ of N. Almost the same is true the representations of the alternating group, but the correspondence in this case is not 1-to-1, see [\cite=J] [\cite=JK]. We are going to avoid this problem by inducing the representation ρ to the symmetric group and working with the induced representation

[formula]

Without loss of generality we can assume that H  ⊂  Hs, then Hs is also generated, as [formula]-module, by the vector v. We can decompose Hs as

[formula]

where Hλ is the sum of all irreducible components in H which correspond to the partition λ. We can group these terms in three parts and break ρs as a sum of three representations

[formula]

where

[formula]

where λ' denotes the dual partition and [formula]. The action of [formula] on Hλ and Hλ' is the same for any partition λ, thus H2 and H3 are isomorphic as representations of the alternating group. Without loss of generality we may assume that the unit vector v = v1 + v2 has components only in H1 and H2.

In this section we will use several probability arguments, which are based on the following lemma:

Suppose there we have lk urns grouped in l boxes of size k. If we put p balls in these urns such that different balls go to different urns, then the probability of having at least q balls in the first box is less than

[formula]

If we drop the restriction that different balls go to different urns then we can omit the exponential factor from the above estimate.

Since different balls have to go to different urns, the relative probability that some ball ends in the first box is not exactly 1 / l, but it is clear that this relative probability is less than [formula]. This allows us to bound the number of balls in the first box using the binomial distribution with [formula]. Let

[formula]

denote the generating function of the binomial distribution with parameters λ and p. It is clear that the probability of having at least q balls in the first box is less than

[formula]

We have that

[formula]

i.e., [formula]. The explicit formula for Bp,λ(x) gives us

[formula]

which implies that

[formula]

The second inequality follows from the estimates

[formula]

and

[formula]

Next we prove the following theorem, which together with estimates for the values of the characters of the symmetric group from [\cite=Ro], implies that the component v1 of v is short:

The ball E47 of radius 47 generated by the set E contains almost all cycles in [formula] of length approximately Kd - 1 / 3 ln K, i.e.,

[formula]

where CL is the conjugancy class in [formula] of all cycles of length L, which is the largest integer of the from 1  +  a(K - 1) less than Kd - 1 / 3 ln K.

Let M denotes the set of points in the d dimensional cube with first coordinate equal to 1.

Let us chose L distinct points in the d dimensional cube of size K. With high probability (more than .99) we can move these points to the set M using only 2 elements from E, provided that K  ≥  106.

The probability of having at least K /  ln K points, which differ only in the first or second coordinate is less than

[formula]

where the finial inequality holds only if K is large enough. Also the probability of having at least ln K points which differ only in the second coordinate is less than

[formula]

The above inequalities imply that almost surely (with probability more than 1 - P1 - P2  >  .99) there are no more than ln K points in each line parallel to the second coordinate axis and no more than K /  ln K points in each square parallel to the first and second coordinate axis.

We claim that if we have a set b of L points in such good position then there exists g∈E2 such that there are no two points in gb which differ only in the first coordinate.

Such an element g can be constructed as follows: Let us enumerate the lines parallel to the second coordinate axis and let bi be the subset of b consisting of all points on the first i lines. We will prove by induction that there exists gi such that there are no two points in gibi which differ only by the first coordinate. The base case is trivial and i = K5 will prove the claim. The induction step is the following: The action of gi + 1 on all the lines but the ith will be the same as the action of gi. There are K possibilities for the action on the ith line. The number of bad choices (the ones where there are two points in gi + 1bi + 1 which differ only in the first coordinate) is at most (si - ti)  ×  ti, where ti is the number of points from b on the i + 1'st line and si is the number of points from b in the square parallel to the first and second coordinate axis containing the i + 1 line. By assumption the points in B are in a good position, therefore ti  ≤   ln K and si  ≤  K /  ln K, thus

[formula]

This shows there is some good choice for the action of gi + 1 on the i + 1'st line. Thus we can define the action of gi + 1 on the i + 1'st line such that no two points in gi + 1bi + 1 differ only in their first coordinate, which proves the induction step and the claim.

If no two points from gb differ only in the first coordinate, we can find h∈E1 such that hgb is a subset of M.

For any permutation [formula] acting on the points in M there exist an element t∈E4d - 5 such that the restriction of t on this square is the same as σ.

Notice that inside E1EiE1 there is a subgroup which preserves M and acts on it as [formula]. This subgroup preserves all coordinates but the ith one. Using the butterfly lemma which gives us that any permutation g in [formula] can be written as g  =  abc where [formula] and [formula], it is easy to show that there is an element in

[formula]

which preserves M and acts on it as σ.

For any integer a less than [formula] there is an element in c0∈E2E3E4E5E6 which is a cycle of length 1  +  a(K - 1) in the face M.

Chose a lines in M such that each line is parallel to some coordinate axis and their union is a tree. Then the products of the shifts on these lines in any order is a cycle on their union which contains exactly 1  +  a(K - 1) points. By definition each shift is in some Ei, which proves that there is an element in [formula] which acts as a cycle of length 1  +  a(K - 1).

Now we can finish the proof of Theorem [\ref=congclass]. Let c be any cycle of length L. By lemma [\ref=tosquare] almost surely the support of c can be moved to M by some element in E2. Lemma [\ref=symonsquare] gives us the c can be conjugated to c0 by an element in E2  ×  E19  =  E21, i.e., that c∈E47.

Having that E47 contains almost a whole conjugancy class we can use the Roichman [\cite=Ro] character estimates: Let λ be a partition of N and CL be the conjugancy class in [formula] consisting of all L-cycles. Then the character χλ of the irreducible representation corresponding to the partition λ satisfies the inequality:

[formula]

Let

[formula]

By definition we have [formula] for any vλ∈Hλ. By equation ([\ref=Roes]) we have

[formula]

On the other hand we have

[formula]

because the elements in E47 move the vector v by at most 47ε and the other elements move v by less than 2. Combining the above two equations gives us

[formula]

which implies that

[formula]

In order to show that v2 is close to an invariant vector we use entirely different argument.

Let B be the set of all ordered h-tuples of points in the six dimensional cube with side K. Let L is the Hilbert space with basis B with the natural action of [formula] on it.

First we will prove the next lemma which will allow us to work with the vector space L.

There is a injective homomorphism of [formula]-modules

[formula]

Let decompose H2 into sum of irreducible representaions

[formula]

where Vλ irreducible representing of [formula] corresponding to λ and mλ is its multiplicity in H. By assumption the space H is generated by the vector v, therefore the multiplicities mλ are 0 or 1. The representation theory of [formula] gives us that Vλ can be embedded in L, which completes the proof.

We will prove that the projection v0 of v2 onto the space of invariant vectors in L is close to v2 by show that the random walk generated by E mixes rapidly (in a fixed number of steps) on the basis B of L. We will reduce the problem to a random walk on the h-tuples of points in the square of size Kd / 2.

There exists labeling of the points such that the the two images Ei  =  π̂i() of group [formula] lie in E1E2E3 and E4E5E6 respectively.

Explain how to obtains powers of some long cycle in K3 as products of exactly 3 elements from E.

Define the operators Ui, for [formula] on the space L with basis B by

[formula]

Notice that Ui.Ui = Ui, because Ei is a subgroup of [formula]. Let Q1 and Q2 denote the operators Q1  =  U1U2U3 and Q2 = U4U5U6.

The next theorem is a quantitative version of the observation that the random walk on B generated by [formula] mixes in few steps, provided that h  <  K3 / 2.

The entries of the matrix {ab,b'} of the operator Q2Q1Q2Q1 defined by

[formula]

satisfy the inequality

[formula]

This inequalities imply that the operator norm of Q2Q1Q2Q1  -  P0 is less than [formula], where P0 is the projection onto the space of [formula] invariant vectors in L.

Let B1 (B2) denote the sets of all h-tuples from B such that there are no two points with the same first (last) three coordinates.

The entries of the matrices {q1;b,b'} and {q2;b,b'} of the operators Q1 and Q2 satisfy

[formula]

Let pi,j,k be the number of points form b which have 4th, 5th and 6th coordinate equal to i, j, and k respectively. Lets choose some ordering of the triples {i,j,k} and let ps be the numbers pi,j,k in this order.

Then the number of elements in E1E2E3 which sends b to an element in B1 is at least

[formula]

because there are K3K2 possibilities for the action of E1E2E3 on the cube corresponding to s, and the number of bad ones (such that [formula], because some point from this cube have the same first 3 coordinates as one of the previous points) is at most

[formula]

Using the definition of Q1 and q1;b;b' we can see that

[formula]

If b∈B1 and b'∈B2 then the number

[formula]

does not depend on b1 and b2 .

Let gi∈Ei satisfy [formula]. If [formula] sends the tuple [formula] to the tuple [formula], then g6 acts on the the line [formula] as shift by b6 - a6; g5 acts on the the line [formula] as shift by b5 - a5 and so on. Thus [formula] determines the action of each gi on exactly h lines (the conditions b∈B1 and b'∈B2 imply that all these lines are different). This shows that

[formula]

Now we can finish the proof of Theorem [\ref=ave]. We can write Q2Q1Q2Q1b as Q2(Q1Q2)(Q1b), therefore

[formula]

The size of the basis B is

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=ave], follows from the above estimates and the inequality

[formula]

Let v0 be the projection of v1 on the space of invariant vectors in L. Using Theorem [\ref=ave] we can see

[formula]

but we also have

[formula]

which implies that

[formula]

Substituting [formula] in the above inequality yields

[formula]

This finishes the proof of Theorem [\ref=KCGammas], because equations ([\ref=h2]) and ([\ref=h1]) imply that

[formula]

The last expression is less then 1 if ε = 1 / 70, therefore v0 is not zero and it is an invariant vector in H  ⊂  Hs

As mentioned in the introduction Theorem [\ref=altexp6] follows immediately from Proposition [\ref=relKC] and Theorems [\ref=relTconst], [\ref=KCGammas].

Proof of Theorems [\ref=main] and [\ref=mainsym]

Theorems [\ref=main] and [\ref=mainsym] follow easily from Theorem [\ref=altexp6]

By Theorem [\ref=altexp6] the alternating groups [formula] are expanders with respect to some generating set Fns for [formula]. The sequence [formula] grows exponentially. Thus, for any sufficiently large n > 1038 there exists s such that

[formula]

Using the butterfly lemma it can be shown that the group [formula] can be written as a product of several copies of [formula] embedded in [formula]. The number of copies P is at most

[formula]

Let πi denote the P embeddings of [formula] in [formula] Taking the union of πi(Fns) one obtains a generating set Fn of [formula]. By Propositions [\ref=KCball] and [\ref=KCrel] we have

[formula]

because every element in [formula] can be written as a product of no more than P elements from [formula]. By the construction it is clear that the size of Fn is bounded above by 109.

If n is small then the above argument does not work, because we can not find ns < n with the desired properties. But there are only finitely many n less than 1038. It is clear for each such n that there exist εn > 0 and a generating set Fn with less than 109 elements such that [formula].

Thus for each n we have constructed a generating set Fn of the alternating group [formula] of size at most L = 109 such that [formula], where ε  =   min {10- 12, inf nεn} > 0, which completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=main].

The alternating group [formula] is a subgroup of index 2 inside [formula]. Let [formula] be an odd permutation. If Fn is an expanding generating set of [formula] then [formula] is an expanding generating set of [formula] and the Kazhdan constants are almost the same.

Using the trivial inequality

[formula]

and proposition [\ref=KCrel] we can see that

[formula]

However it is clear that any element in [formula] can be written as a product of two elements from [formula], thus

[formula]

These two inequalities give us

[formula]

which finishes the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainsym].

In the above proofs of Theorems [\ref=main] and [\ref=mainsym], we have obtained huge generating sets Fn and n with very weak bounds for the Kazhdan constant s. Using a more careful analysis it is possible to decrease the size of Fn and to improve the bounds for the Kazhdan constants. We can prove that for all sufficiently large n there exist generating sets Fn and n of the alternating and the symmetric groups such that

|Fn|  ≤  20 and |n|  ≤  20,

both Fn and n consist only of involutions,

[formula] and [formula].

The bounds for the Kazhdan constant s in Theorems [\ref=main] and [\ref=mainsym] are explicit in the case n > 1040. This restriction comes form the condition K  ≥  106 in Theorem [\ref=KCGammas]. We suspect that some modification in the proof will allow us to weaken requirement.

Comments

In this section we will briefly discuss some variations of the construction.

As in sections [\ref=relKC] and [\ref=altexp6], we will denote N = Kd, where d is fixed. Let H be any group which acts transitively on the set of K points, we will also assume that all elements of H act as even permutations, i.e., we have [formula].

We will define the group

[formula]

This group can be embedded in [formula] in d different ways using πi. Let [formula] be the union of the images of these embeddings.

The main result in section [\ref=altexp6], Theorem [\ref=KCGammas], says that

[formula]

provided that d = 6 and K is large enough. This result can be generalized to any transitive group:

If H is a transitive group acting on K points then

[formula]

provided that d = 6 and K is large enough.

The proof is almost the same as the one of Theorem [\ref=KCGammas]. The only difference is that Lemma [\ref=cycle] does not hold. However there is a weaker analog of this lemma:

For any integer a less than Kd - 2 there is an element c0 in E2, which acts on M as a permutation with Ka non-fixed points.

Let g∈H be an element without fixed points -- such an element exists in any transitive group because the average number of fixed points is 1. The c0 is the image of an element in Δ(H) which is equal to g in a copies of H and is identity in the other copies.

The same argument as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=KCGammas] gives that E47 (even E43) contains almost all elements in the conjugancy class C, which contains c0. By construction the permutations in this conjugancy class contain L non-fixed points, where L is approximately Kd - 1 / 3 ln K.

For such conjugancy classes there are character estimates, see [\cite=Ro], similar to ([\ref=Roes]):

[formula]

where c and q are some universal constants. The precise values of these constants are not in the literature but using the proof of Theorem 1 from [\cite=Ro] one can obtain estimates for these constants. Our computations show that we can use q = 1 - 10- 3 and c = 10- 3.

The estimate in ([\ref=h2]) continues to hold if K is sufficiently large. The bound depends on the values of the constants c and q above. A careful computation of the constants c and q shows that we can use q = 1 - 10- 3 and c = 10- 3, which gives that if K > 1010 then K is sufficiently large and the estimate ([\ref=h2]) holds. The rest of the proof is the same as in Theorem [\ref=KCGammas].

Actually we have shown that

[formula]

if d = 6 and C(6)  =  60. This result is also valid for larger values of d with C(d) = 10d and the proof is essentially the same.

It is interesting to see if a similar result holds for small values of d: In the case d = 1 the question does not make sense because the group [formula] is not generated by the set E. If d = 2, we think that it is not possible to obtain a bound for the Kazhdan constant which is independent on K, because the group Δ(H) is not large enough.

Using more careful analysis of the random walk generated by E on the set of h tuples, it is possible to show that there is a uniform bound for the Kazhdan constant if d = 4 or d = 5. We do not know whether such result is also valid in the case d = 3.

In order to use the groups Δ(H) to construct bounded degree expanders we need to find a family of groups Hs which acts transitively on Ks points such that there is a uniform lower bound for the Kazhdan constant s:

[formula]

for some generating sets Ss. In our proof we used the groups [formula] acting on [formula]. A more natural family of groups with these properties is [formula] acting on [formula] or on the projective space [formula], where n  ≥  3 is fixed and q is a power of a prime number. In the case n = 4 and q = 2s we can even find an element in [formula] which acts as a long cycle on [formula]. In this case we will obtain slightly better Kazhdan constant s with respect to some generating set of [formula] where [formula].

Using the groups [formula] has some advantages: it is possible to generate the product of 2s2 copies of the matrix algebra [formula] by just three elements. This allows us to construct generating sets S̄s of [formula] such that

[formula]

Using these generating sets we can make the Cayley graphs of the product of s copies of [formula] expanders.

Another advantage is the following: Let [formula] be the infinite product of the groups [formula]. Inside [formula] there is a dense subgroup [formula] generated by the set S, which projects to Ss in every factor. Using the methods from [\cite=KSL3k], it can be shown that the the pro-finite completion of the group [formula] is slightly larger than [formula] and it has property τ. We can use this group to obtain a dense subgroup G inside

[formula]

which also has property τ. G is the first example of a dense subgroup in the product of infinitely many alternating groups which does not map onto [formula], for more details see [\cite=KtauSGG] and for other examples of dense subgroups in such products see [\cite=Pyb].

Theorem [\ref=main] can be viewed as a major stop towards proving the conjectured suggested by Alex Lubotzky [\cite=Lpr]:

Let Gi be the family of all non-abelian finite simple groups. There exists a generating sets Si (with uniformly bounded size) such that the Cayley graphs C(Gi,Si) form a family of ε-expanders for some fixed ε > 0.

A strong supporting evidence for this conjecture is the following well known fact (see [\cite=expanderbook] [\cite=lu] [\cite=YSh]): The groups of a fixed Lie type over different finite fields form an expander family, provided that the rank of the Lie group is at least 2. However both the size of the generating set and the expanding constant depend on the rank. This shows that almost all non-abelian finite simple groups can be put into infinitely many families such the groups in each family can be made expanders. Another supporting evidence for this conjecture is that for any non-abelian finite simple group there exist 4 generators such that the diameter of the corresponding Cayley graph is logarithmic in the size of the group (see [\cite=BLK] and [\cite=KR]). However in these examples it is known that the Cayley graphs are not expanders.

As with many similar results, one expects that the proof of Conjecture [\ref=FSGE] will use the classification of the finite simple groups.

The first major step towards proving Conjecture [\ref=FSGE] was made in [\cite=KSL3k] -- there it is shown that the Cayley graphs of [formula] for any prime power q and infinitely many n can be made expanders simultaneously by choosing a suitable generating sets. This can be generalized to all families of finite simple groups of Lie type of rank at least 2.

The results in this paper prove the Lubotzky conjecture in case of the alternating groups, which was believed that this is the most difficult case. These results, together with some new ones in the rank one case, are combined in [\cite=KNFS], which almost proves Conjecture [\ref=FSGE].
