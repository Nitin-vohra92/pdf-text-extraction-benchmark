REFINEMENT OF INEQUALITIES AMONG MEANS

Mean of Order t

Let us consider the following well known mean of order t:

[formula]

for all [formula].

In particular, we have

[formula]

The means, H(a,b), G(a,b), A(a,b) and S(a,b) are known in the literature as harmonic, geometric, arithmetic and root-square means respectively. For simplicity we can call the measure, N1(a,b) as square-root mean. It is well know that [\cite=beb] the mean of order s given in ([\ref=eq1]) is monotonically increasing in s, then we can write

[formula]

Dragomir and Pearce [\cite=drp] (page 242) proved the following inequality:

[formula]

for all a,b  >  0, a  ≠  b, r∈(0,1). In particular take [formula] in ([\ref=eq3]), we get

[formula]

After necessary calculations in ([\ref=eq5]), we get

[formula]

On the other side we can easily check that

[formula]

Finally, the expressions ([\ref=eq2]), ([\ref=eq5]) and ([\ref=eq6]) lead us to the following inequality:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Moreover, we can write

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus we have three new means, where N1(a,b) appears as a natural way. The N2(a,b) can be seen in Taneja [\cite=tan1] [\cite=tan2] and the mean N3(a,b) is known as Heron's mean [\cite=bob]. Some studies on it can be seen in Zhang and Wu [\cite=zhw].

Difference of Means and Their Convexity

Let us consider the following difference of means:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

We easily check that

[formula]

Now, we shall prove the convexity of the means ([\ref=eq8])-([\ref=eq18]). It is based on the following lemma.

Let [formula] be a convex and differentiable function satisfying [formula]. Consider a function

[formula]

then the function φf(a,b) is convex in [formula], and satisfies the following inequality:

[formula]

It is well known that for the convex and differentiable function f, we have the inequality

[formula]

for all [formula].

Take [formula] and x  =  1 in ([\ref=eq22]) one gets

[formula]

or equivalently,

[formula]

Since f(1)  =  f'(1)  =  0, then from ([\ref=eq23]) we get ([\ref=eq21]).

Now we shall show that the function φf(a,b) is jointly convex in a and b. Since the function f is convex, then for any (x1,y1), [formula], 0  <  λ1,λ2  <  1, λ1  +  λ2  =  1 we can write

[formula]

[formula]

Multiply ([\ref=eq24]) by λ1y1  +  λ2y2 one gets

[formula]

i.e.,

[formula]

for any [formula]. The expression ([\ref=eq25]) completes the required proof.

Now we shall show that the difference of means given by ([\ref=eq8])-([\ref=eq18]) are convex in [formula] Later in Section 3 we shall apply the convexity of these functions to establish improvement over the inequality ([\ref=eq7]).

The difference of means given by ([\ref=eq8])-([\ref=eq18]) are nonnegative and convex in [formula].

We shall write each measure in the form of generating function according to the measure ([\ref=eq20]), and then give their first and second order derivatives. It is understood that x∈(0,  ∞  ).

[formula] For MSA(a,b):

[formula]

[formula] For MSN3(a,b):

[formula]

[formula] For MSN2(a,b):

[formula]

[formula] For MSN1(a,b):

[formula]

[formula] For MSG(a,b):

[formula]

[formula] For MSH(a,b):

[formula]

[formula] For MAN2(a,b):

[formula]

[formula] For MAG(a,b):

[formula]

[formula] For MAH(a,b):

[formula]

[formula] For MN2N1(a,b):

[formula]

Since [formula], [formula] and [formula], then obviously, [formula], [formula].

[formula] For MN2G(a,b):

[formula]

Since [formula], [formula] and [formula], then obviously, [formula], [formula].

We see that in all the cases the generating function f(  ·  )(1)  =  f'(  ·  )(1)  =  0 and the second derivative is positive for all x∈(0,  ∞  ). This proves the nonegativity and convexity of the means ([\ref=eq8])-([\ref=eq23]) in [formula]. This completes the proof of the theorem.

The inequality ([\ref=eq7]) also present more nonnegative differences but we have considered only the convex ones.

Inequality Among Difference of Means

In view of ([\ref=eq7]), the following inequalities are obviously true:

[formula]

In view of ([\ref=eq7]), ([\ref=eq19]) and ([\ref=eq30]), we can easily check that

[formula]

In this section we shall improve the inequalities ([\ref=eq7]) and then compare with the inequalities ([\ref=eq26])-([\ref=eq30]). This refinement is based on the following lemma.

Let [formula] be two convex functions satisfying the assumptions:

(i) [formula], [formula];

(ii) f1 and f2 are twice differentiable in [formula];

(iii) there exists the real constants α,β such that [formula] and

[formula]

for all x  >  0 then we have the inequalities:

[formula]

for all a,b∈(0,  ∞  ).

Let us consider the functions

[formula]

and

[formula]

where α and βare as given by ([\ref=eq32]).

In view of item (i), we have k(1)  =  h(1)  =  0 and k'(1)  =  h'(1)  =  0. Since the functions f1(x) and f2(x) are twice differentiable, then in view of ([\ref=eq32]), we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

for all x∈(0,  ∞  ).

In view of ([\ref=eq34]) and ([\ref=eq35]), we can say that the functions k(  ·  ) and h(  ·  ), are convex on [formula].

According to ([\ref=eq21]), we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=eq36]) and ([\ref=eq37]) we have the proof of ([\ref=eq33]).

[formula]

For it, let us consider

[formula]
