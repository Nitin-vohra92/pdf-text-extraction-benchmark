Origin of charge density wave formation in insulators from a high resolution photoemission study of BaIrO3

The investigation of charge density wave (CDW) and its influence on the properties of materials has been the subject of intense research for many decades now. Such a phenomenon is often observed in low-dimensional metallic systems due to the spatial modulation of the conduction electron density, the periodicity of which is not commensurate with the unit-cell. As a consequence, a gap opens up in the single particle excitation spectrum of such materials below the transition temperature. Clearly, CDW is expected only for metallic systems. Interestingly, BaIrO3, an insulating material, exhibits CDW transition at about 175 K [\cite=cao1]. As such an unusual observation is likely to evoke considerable interest, it is important to understand the origin of the CDW anomaly in such insulating materials.

BaIrO3 exhibits many interesting crystallographic and magnetic anomalies [\cite=cao1] [\cite=cao2] [\cite=powell] [\cite=lindsay] [\cite=chamberland]. The crystal structure is monoclinic (space group C2/m) and consists of Ir3O12 trimers, where the IrO6 octahedra are face shared. Inter-trimer link occurs by corner-sharing to form columns parallel to c-axis, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1. It appears [\cite=lindsay] that the trimers are marginally tilted with respect to each other and thus a moment-containing chain runs parallel to c-axis. Quasi-one-dimensional nature of this compound is evident from the anisotropic transport behavior [\cite=cao1]. The complexity of the structure results in twisting and buckling of the trimers, and in multiplicity of Ir-O and Ba-O bond distances, thereby creating 4 types of Ir and 3 types of Ba [\cite=powell] [\cite=siegrist]. A finding unique to this compound is that ferromagnetism sets in at the same temperature at which CDW forms! Thus, it is fascinating that there is an intimate relationship between magnetism and lattice. Therefore, there is an urgent need to throw more light on this relationship. Many other interesting properties are exhibited by this compound, for instance, very low magnetic moment, additional transitions around 80 and 26 K, non-metallicity despite very short Ir-Ir distances etc. All these anomalies reveal that BaIrO3 is truly an exotic material, warranting further urgent investigations.

In this letter, we provide experimental evidence for the fact that there are indeed electronic states at the Fermi level, EF, which are localized presumably due to crystallographic features like disorder and distortions, and that the CDW evolves due to these localized electronic states. While the existence of such localized states forming a 'pseudogap' at EF has been predicted long ago [\cite=mott] [\cite=anderson], it is the high resolution employed in the present study that enables us to show directly the presence of such states and to track its temperature dependence to understand the CDW in insulators. |E - EF|3 / 2-dependence of the spectral density of states (SDOS) emphasizes the role of magnetism in determining the electronic structure. In addition, we observe significant changes in Ba core level spectra prior to CDW transition suggesting an importance of Ba-O covalency in its electronic properties.

The sample was prepared by a conventional solid state reaction method in the polycrystalline form using ultra-high pure ingredients (BaCO3 and Ir metal powders). In order to achieve large grain size and stoichiometry, the final product was pelletized and sintered at a rather high temperature (1000 oC) for more than 2 days and furnace-cooled (rather than quenching) which ensures the oxygen stoichiometry close to 3 [\cite=chamberland]. The x-ray diffraction pattern exhibits single phase without any signature of impurity and the lattice constants (a = 10.015 Å, b = 5.748 Å, c = 15.157 Å and β= 103.27o) are found to be in excellent agreement with those reported for single crystals [\cite=cao1]. In addition, we performed electrical resistivity measurements by a conventional four-probe method and establish the presence of a CDW transition at 183 K from an insulating phase; the onset of a ferromagnetic transition at the same temperature is observed by dc magnetic susceptibility measurements taken in the presence of a magnetic field of 5 kOe. Somewhat higher transition temperature observed in this compound compared to the single crystals [\cite=cao1] ensures good quality of the sample. Photoemission measurements were performed using a Gammadata Scienta analyzer, SES2002 at a base pressure of 4×  10- 11 torr. The experimental resolution was 0.8 eV for Al Kα (1486.6 eV), 4.5 meV for He  II (40.8 eV) and 1.4 meV for He  I (21.2 eV) measurements. The sample surface was cleaned by in situ scraping and the cleanliness was ascertained by tracking the sharpness of O 1s feature and absence of C 1s peaks.

Valence band spectra at room temperature obtained using 21.2 eV, 40.8 eV and 1486.6 eV excitation energies are shown in Fig. 1. There are four discernible features marked by A, B, C and D in the figure. While features B and C appearing at binding energies (BE) 6 >  ~ BE ~  >  3 eV are large in the low excitation energy spectra, the features A and D are enhanced significantly in the Al Kα spectrum. The intensity of the feature D becomes maximum in the latter. Considering strong dependence of the relative transition matrix elements on excitation energies [\cite=yeh], the features B and C can be attributed to O 2p non-bonding electron excitations and the feature A to the bonding levels with the electronic states having primarily O 2p character. The feature D corresponds to the excitation of primarily Ir 5d electrons.

Since a major conclusion is based on the spectra obtained at low excitation energies, it is important to establish that our conclusions are representative of the bulk. The feature D in Fig. 1 is distinctly separated from the O 2p-related signals in the 40.8 eV and 1486.6 eV spectra. Thus, Ir 5d contributions can reliably be delineated by fitting the O 2p bands using three Gaussians representing features A, B and C as performed in other systems [\cite=casrvo] [\cite=lacavo] [\cite=kbmprb] [\cite=ruthenates]. The resultant fit obtained by least square error method is shown by lines in Fig. 1 and the extracted Ir 5d band is shown in Fig. 2(a). The spectral intensity at the Fermi level appears to be significantly small in both the spectra, and a peak appears around 1.3 eV binding energy with a tail extending down to 3 eV. Interestingly, the spectral lineshape of both 40.8 eV and 1486.6 eV-spectra are identical despite their large difference in probing depth; this is demonstrated by superposing the resolution broadened 40.8 eV spectrum (solid line in the figure) over the 1486.6 eV-spectrum. This establishes that the surface and the bulk electronic structures are essentially identical in contrast to the observations in 3d and 4d transition metal oxides [\cite=casrvo] [\cite=lacavo] [\cite=kbmprb] [\cite=ruthenates].

We now focus on the evolution of the valence band spectral intensities as a function of temperature in order to investigate the origin of CDW ground state to bring out the point of major emphasis of this paper. No spectral modification is observed down to 183 K. As the temperature is lowered across 183 K, the intensity at EF in the 40.8 eV spectra decreases dramatically and the leading edge shifts to higher binding energies as shown in Fig. 2(b). Large resolution broadening in the 1486.6 eV spectra smears out all these changes; however, these spectra ensure that there is no significant modification at higher energy scales. In order to bring out a better clarity, we expand EF-region of 40.8 eV spectra in Fig. 2(c) at temperatures 300K, 150K and 28K. The shift of the leading valence band edge to higher binding energy is clearly evident at 150 K, which reduces the spectral weight at EF significantly. A further decrease in temperature leads to an opening of a band gap of the order of 50 meV below EF accompanied by an enhancement in intensity around 0.9 eV binding energy as inferred from Fig. 2(b).

In order to discuss the changes at EF in more detail, we show the high resolution spectra obtained with He  I radiations in Fig. 3. The shift in the valence band edge with decreasing temperature is clearly evident in Fig. 3(a). The photoemission response can be expressed as [formula] where, g(ε) and F(ε1,T) represent the matrix element weighted density of states and Fermi-distribution function, respectively. The Lorentzian broadenings (Le and Lh) due to the finite lifetime of photo-electrons and photo-holes will be small close to EF. Since the resolution broadening represented by the Gaussian, G (full width at half maximum = 1.4 meV) is negligible compared to the energy scale of investigation, I(ε) / F(ε,T) provide a good representation of the spectral density of states, SDOS, as has also been observed in other systems [\cite=kbmprb].

The SDOS thus obtained at 300 K and 150 K are shown in Fig. 3(b) along with the spectra at other temperatures. It is important to note here that such an estimation of SDOS is sensitive to the precise location of EF. Therefore, we have carefully determined EF at each temperature by the Fermi cut off as observed for silver mounted on the sample holder together with the sample. The representative spectra are shown in Fig. 3(a) at 20 K and 300 K. In order to verify the reliability of our analysis, we carry out the same exercise for silver as described above (see Fig. 3(b)). The room temperature spectrum clearly reproduces the flat density of states of silver in a wide energy range (>   3.5 kBT), thereby providing a confidence in this procedure.

Interestingly, it is clear from Fig. 3(b) that the spectral DOS at room temperature exhibits a finite intensity and a distinct dip at EF suggesting the signature of a 'pseudogap' [\cite=mott]. This observation in conjunction with the insulating transport behavior [\cite=cao1] suggests that all these electronic states are essentially localized. This is not surprising for such a quasi-one dimensional system where a small lattice distortion and/or impurity leads to localization of the electronic states. Existence of such localized states forming a pseudogap at EF has been predicted long before [\cite=mott] [\cite=anderson]. High resolution employed for these measurements makes it possible to directly probe such electronic states experimentally. A notable finding is that the intensity at EF becomes close to zero below the CDW transition, thus forming a soft gap at EF. Eventually a gap of the order of 50 meV below EF opens up around 83 K with a corresponding increase in intensity around 0.9 eV binding energy.

It is well known that the disorder leads to a |E - EF|1 / 2 (E is energy) cusp at EF in metals [\cite=altshuler-aronov] [\cite=ddsprl]. In an insulator consisting of localized electronic states at EF, a soft Coulomb gap opens up due to electron-electron Coulomb repulsion; in such a situation, the ground state is stable with respect to a single-particle excitation only if SDOS can be characterized by (E - EF)2-dependence [\cite=efros] [\cite=massey]. In contrast to this, in the present case, the SDOS exhibits a |E - EF|3 / 2-dependence spanning a large energy range close to EF (BE ≤   300 meV) as shown in Fig. 3(c). Most interestingly, this dependence remain unchanged down to the lowest temperature studied. Thus, the opening of a soft gap observed here has an origin different from the electron-electron Coulomb repulsion observed in other systems [\cite=massey]. The exponent of 3/2 in SDOS suggests strong influence of electron-magnon coupling on the electronic structure [\cite=irkhin] presumably responsible for the ferromanetic ground state.

We now turn to another fascinating observation in the core level spectra of metallic ions. In Fig. 4(a), we show Ba 3d5 / 2 spectra exhibiting a sharp feature around 779 eV binding energy. Interestingly, a decrease in temperature from 300 K to 210 K leads to a significantly large shift in the peak position and there is no further shift as the temperature is lowered further [\cite=sampath2]. Similar effect has also been observed for other core levels as shown for Ba 4d5 / 2 in Fig. 4(b), while the Ir core levels remain unchanged (see the same figure). The linewidth of the curves for Ba remain the same below 210 K but it is much larger at room temperature. Interestingly, 300 K spectra can be reproduced remarkably by a superposition of the 25 K spectra (~   78%) and the same shifted by 0.5 eV (~   22%) towards higher binding energy as shown in the figure. It is therefore clear that the spectra for Ba at room temperature consists of signals from two types of Ba ions. However, there are three types of Ba ions in the crystal structure [\cite=powell] depending upon the Ba-O bond distances and clustering. We, thus, calculated the Madelung potential considering only the nearest neighbor cluster ([formula]; a is a constant). We find that this potential is nearly the same (~  4.05a) for two types of Ba ions, which is slightly different from the third one (~  4.1a), thereby, qualitatively accounting for the features. In short, the above results reveal that there are profound changes in the covalency effects around Ba at a temperature higher than the CDW transition temperature. To our knowledge, it is for the first time that such an effect is identified prior to the formation of CDW. While it is not clear whether this is a precursor effect to CDW formation, a confirmation of such a relationship from future studies is expected to open up new direction to understand the origin of CDW, just as pseudo-gap effects in high temperature superconductors have attracted a lot of attention. We hope this work will motivate further work to look for similar features in other non-metals, which will help in the advancement of the knowledge of phase transitions.

In conclusion, to our knowledge for the first time, we have demonstrated directly the evolution of charge density wave due to localized electronic states. It is also shown that a soft gap opens up across the CDW transition. The energy dependence of the spectral density of states reveals the role of magnetism on the electronic structure in the vicinity of Fermi level, which signals an intimate relationship between ferromagnetism and charge density wave in this system. The observation of profound changes in the Ba-O covalency prior to the formation of charge density wave poses a new question with respect to the role of precursor effects.
