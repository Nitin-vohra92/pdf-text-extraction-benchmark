Isometry groups of k-curvature homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifolds

Introduction

Let M: = (M,g) be a pseudo-Riemannian manifold of signature (p,q). Let gP: = g|TPM (resp. [formula]) be the restriction of the metric (resp. the [formula] covariant derivative of the curvature tensor) to the tangent space at P∈M. We define the k-model of M at P by setting:

[formula]

One says that [formula] is an isomorphism from the k-model of M1 at P1 to the k-model of M2 at P2 if φ is a linear isomorphism from TP1M1 to TP2M2 with

[formula]

One says that M is k-curvature homogeneous if the k-models [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic for any P,Q∈M.

In the Riemannian setting (p = 0), Takagi [\cite=T74] constructed 0-curvature homogeneous complete non-compact Riemannian manifolds; compact examples were exhibited subsequently by Ferus, Karcher, and Münzer [\cite=FKM81]. Although many other examples have been constructed, there are no known Riemannian manifolds which are 1-curvature homogeneous but not locally homogeneous and it is natural to conjecture that any 1-curvature homogeneous Riemannian manifold is locally homogeneous.

In the Lorentzian setting (p = 1), curvature homogeneous manifolds which are not locally homogeneous were constructed by Cahen et. al. [\cite=CLPT90]; 1-curvature homogeneous Lorentzian manifolds which are not locally homogeneous have been exhibited by Bueken and Djori [\cite=BD00] and by Bueken and Vanhecke [\cite=BV97]. One could conjecture that a 2-curvature homogeneous Lorentzian manifold must be locally homogeneous.

It is clear that local homogeneity implies k-curvature homogeneity for any k. The following result, due to Singer [\cite=S60] in the Riemannian setting and to F. Podesta and A. Spiro [\cite=PS04] in the general context, provides a partial converse:

There exists an integer kp,q so that if M is a complete simply connected pseudo-Riemannian manifold of signature (p,q) which is kp,q-curvature homogeneous, then (M,g) is homogeneous.

Sekigawa, Suga, and Vanhecke [\cite=SSV92] [\cite=SSV95] showed any 1-curvature homogeneous complete simply connected Riemannian manifold of dimension m < 5 is homogeneous; thus k0,2 = k0,3 = k0,4 = 1. The estimate [formula] was established by Gromov [\cite=Gr86]. Results of [\cite=GS04] can be used to show kp,q  ≥   min (p,q); we conjecture kp,q  =   min (p,q) + 1.

If H is a homogeneous space, let [formula] for any point Q∈H; the isomorphism class of [formula] is independent of the point Q∈H. We say that M is k-modeled on H and that [formula] is a k-model for M if [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic for any P∈M.

Throughout this paper, we shall adopt the notational convention that

[formula]

In [\cite=GS04x], we exhibited complete metrics on [formula] of neutral signature (3 + 2p,3 + 2p) which are (p + 2)-curvature homogeneous, which are 0-modeled on an indecomposible symmetric space, but which are not (p + 3)-curvature homogeneous; these examples show that the constants kp,q  →    ∞   as (p,q)  →    ∞  . The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-1.1] rested on a careful analysis of the isometry groups of the model spaces. In this paper, we continue our study of the manifolds introduced in [\cite=GS04x] by examining their isometry groups and the isometry groups of their k-models.

We recall the definition of the metrics on [formula] which were introduced in [\cite=GS04x]. We will be defining a number of tensors in this paper and, in the interests of brevity, we shall only give the non-zero components up to the usual symmetries. Let x = (x1,...,xm) be the usual coordinates on [formula]. Let

[formula]

be coordinates on [formula]. Let [formula]. Let

[formula]

where g6 + 4p,F is the metric of neutral signature (3 + 2p,3 + 2p) on [formula] with:

[formula]

Let M  =  M6 + 4p,F. Then:

All geodesics in M extend for infinite time.

[formula] is a diffeomorphism for all [formula].

[formula] are the non-zero components of [formula] where ξi∈{y,z1,...,zp,,1,...,p}.

All scalar Weyl invariants of M vanish.

M is a symmetric space if and only if F is at most quadratic.

The manifolds [formula]

We can specialize this construction as follows. Let g6 + 4p,k be defined by setting F = fp,k where we let:

[formula]

As exceptional cases, we set:

[formula]

Let 1  ≤  k  ≤  p + 2.

M6 + 4p,0 is an indecomposible symmetric space.

M6 + 4p,k is an indecomposible homogeneous space which is not symmetric.

The manifolds [formula]

Let ψ  =  ψ(y) be a real analytic function of one variable such that

[formula]

Define a metric g6 + 4p,ψ on [formula] by taking F = fψ where

[formula]

The following result shows that the geometry of a homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifold need not determined by the k-model:

Let 0  ≤  j < k  ≤  p + 2.

M6 + 4p,k is j-modeled on M6 + 4p,j; M6 + 4p,j is not k-modeled on M6 + 4p,k.

N6 + 4p,ψ is p + 2-curvature homogeneous and p + 2-modeled on M6 + 4p,p + 2.

N6 + 4p,ψ is not p + 3-curvature homogeneous and not locally homogeneous.

Isometry groups

Let G(M) (resp. [formula]) be the isometry group of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold M (resp. of a k-model [formula]). In this paper, we study the groups G(M6 + 4p,k), G(N6 + 4p,ψ), and [formula] for any point P of [formula]. A byproduct of our study is the following result that shows, not surprisingly, that the symmetric space M6 + 4p,0 has the largest isometry group.

Let 1  ≤  k  ≤  p. Let np: = (6 + 4p) + (p + 1)(3 + 2p) + (2p + 3).

dim {G(M6 + 4p,0)} = np + (p + 1)(2p + 1).

[formula].

dim {G(M6 + 4p,p + 1)}  =   dim {G(M6 + 4p,p)} - 1.

dim {G(M6 + 4p,p + 2)}  =   dim {G(M6 + 4p,p + 1)} - 1.

dim {G(N6 + 4p,ψ)}  =   dim {G(M6 + 4p,p + 2)} - 1.

Here is a brief outline to the remainder of this paper. In Section [\ref=sect-2], we review some results from [\cite=GS04x]. In Section [\ref=sect-3], we reduce the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-1.5] to a purely algebraic problem by showing for any [formula] that for 0  ≤  k  ≤  p + 2, we have:

[formula]

In Section [\ref=sect-4], we complete the proof by determining [formula] for 0  ≤  k  ≤  p + 2.

Models

It is convenient to work in the purely algebraic setting. Let

[formula]

where 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 is a non-degenerate inner product of signature (p,q) on a finite dimensional vector space V of dimension m = p + q and where [formula] satisfies the appropriate symmetries of the covariant derivatives of the curvature tensor for 0  ≤  μ  ≤  ν; if ν  =    ∞  , then the sequence is infinite. We say that [formula] is a ν-model for a pseudo-Riemannian manifold M = (M,g) if for each point P∈M, there is an isomorphism φP:TPM  →  V so that

[formula]

Clearly M is ν-curvature homogeneous if and only if it admits a ν-model.

Models for the manifolds M6 + 4p,k and N6 + 4p,ψ

Let

[formula]

be a basis for [formula]. Define a hyperbolic inner-product on [formula] by pairing ordinary variables with the corresponding dual [formula]-variables:

[formula]

Define [formula] with non-zero components:

[formula]

Define tensors [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  p with non-zero components:

[formula]

Finally define [formula] and [formula] by setting

[formula]

Define models:

[formula]

Let 0  ≤  k  ≤  p + 2.

[formula] is a k-model for M6 + 4p,k.

[formula] is a p + 2-model for N6 + 4p,ψ.

Isometry groups in the geometric setting

In this section we will reduce the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-1.5] to a purely algebraic problem by showing:

Let 0  ≤  k  ≤  p + 2.

[formula].

[formula].

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-3.1] will be based on several Lemmas. In Lemma [\ref=lem-3.2], we review a basic result about group actions. In Lemma [\ref=lem-3.3], we relate the full isometry group G(  ·  ) to the isotropy subgroup. In Lemma [\ref=lem-3.4], we relate the isotropy subgroup to the isometry group of the ∞  -model. In Lemma [\ref=lem-3.5], we relate isometry group of the ∞  -model to the isometry group of an appropriate finite model.

The following result is well known.

Let G be a Lie group which acts continuously on a metric space X. If x∈X, let G  ·  x be the orbit and let Gx  =  {g∈G:gx = x} be the isotropy subgroup.

We have a smooth principle bundle Gx  →  G  →  G  ·  x.

dim {G}  =   dim {Gx}  +   dim {G  ·  x}.

We can relate dim {G(M)} to dim {GP(M)} for M  =  M6 + 4p,k or M  =  N6 + 4p,ψ.

Let [formula]. Let 0  ≤  k  ≤  p + 2.

dim {G(M6 + 4p,k)} = 6 + 4p +  dim {GP(M6 + 4p,k)}.

dim {G(N6 + 4p,ψ)} = 6 + 4p - 1 +  dim {GP(N6 + 4p,ψ)}.

We apply Lemma [\ref=lem-3.2] to the canonical action of G(M) on [formula]. Assertion (1) follows as M6 + 4p,k is a homogeneous space. Let [formula]. Set

[formula]

We showed [\cite=GS04x] that if B is a basis satisfying the normalizations of Section [\ref=sect-2.1], then the only non-zero components of [formula] are given by:

[formula]

We also showed that the following assertions are equivalent:

α6 + 4p,ν(ψ1)(P1) = α6 + 4p,ν(ψ2)(P2) for all [formula].

There exists an isometry φ:N6 + 4p,ψ1  →  N6 + 4p,ψ2 with φ(P1) = P2.

The functions α6 + 4p,ν(ψ) are constant on the hyperplanes y = c; thus the group of isometries acts transitively on such a hyperplane. Consequently

[formula]

Since N6 + 4p,ψ is not a homogeneous space, equality holds.

Let P∈M. We can show that GP(M) is isomorphic to [formula] under certain circumstances.

Let M1: = (M1,g1) and M2: = (M2,g2) be real analytic. Assume for ϱ = 1,2 that there are points Pϱ∈Mϱ so exp Pϱ:TPϱMϱ  →  Mϱ is a diffeomorphism. If φ:TP1M1  →  TP2M2 induces an isomorphism from [formula] to [formula], then [formula] is an isometry from M1 to M2.

If M  =  M6 + 4p,k or if M  =  N6 + 4p,ψ, then [formula] for any point [formula].

Belger and Kowalski [\cite=BeKo94] note about analytic pseudo-Riemannian metrics that the "metric g is uniquely determined, up to local isometry, by the tensors R, [formula], ..., [formula], ... at one point."; see also Gray [\cite=Gr73] for related work. The first assertion now follows; the second follows immediately from the first and from Theorem [\ref=thm-1.2].

We now replace the infinite model by a finite model:

Let [formula]. Let 0  ≤  k  ≤  p + 2. Then:

[formula].

[formula].

If M is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, restriction induces an injective map

[formula]

Suppose that M  =  M4p + 6,k for k < p + 2. Then [formula] for j > k; consequently any isomorphism of the k-model is an isomorphism of the ∞  -model; this proves Assertion (1) for 0  ≤  k  ≤  p + 1.

To deal with the remaining cases, we suppose that ψ(p + 3) and ψ(p + 4) are always positive, but drop the restriction that ψ(p + 3)  ≠  aeby. Choose a basis B for TPM satisfying the normalizations of Section [\ref=sect-2.1]. If [formula], then gB also satisfies the normalizations of Section [\ref=sect-2.1]. We may then apply Equation ([\ref=eqn-3.a]) to see that g is in fact an isomorphism of the ∞  -model since g preserves [formula] for any k > p + 2. The first assertion with k = p + 2 and the second assertion of the Lemma now follow; this also completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-3.1].

Isometry groups of the models

Let [formula] and let [formula] be the restriction of Ai to [formula]. We introduce the affine models by restricting the domain and suppressing the metric:

[formula]

[formula].

Let [formula] be Lie algebra of skew-symmetric s  ×  s real matrices. Set

[formula]

Let [formula]. The space K is preserved by g. Thus

[formula]

By Equation ([\ref=eqn-2.a]), 〈gSi,gSj〉 = 0 and 〈gSi,gS*j〉  =  δij. Thus

[formula]

for all i,j. Set γ: = g0gt1. One then has

[formula]

Conversely, if Equation ([\ref=eqn-4.a]) is satisfied then [formula]. The map g  →  (g0,γ) yields an identification of

[formula]

as a twisted product. The Lemma follows as [formula].

There is a natural action of [formula] on [formula]. We continue our study by relating [formula] and the isotropy subgroup [formula].

[formula] for k  ≤  p + 1.

[formula].

Lemma [\ref=lem-4.2] will follow from Lemma [\ref=lem-3.2] and the following relations:

[formula]

We first show ⊃   holds in Equation ([\ref=eqn-4.b]). Let [formula]. Assume that

[formula]

Set gX = ξ and set

[formula]

The non-zero components of [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  p + 2 are then given by

[formula]

Thus [formula]. Furthermore, [formula] if a2 = 1. Consequently:

[formula]

We must establish the reverse inclusions to complete the proof. Let [formula]. Let Jξ(η1,η2): = R(ξ,η1,η2,ξ) be the Jacobi form. Adopt the Einstein convention and sum over repeated indices to expand

[formula]

where a = 〈ξ,X*〉. We have the following cases

If a = 0, then Jξ = 0 on [formula] so [formula].

If [formula], then [formula] so [formula].

If [formula], then [formula]. Consequently

[formula]

Consequently we have

[formula]

Suppose k = p + 2. Since [formula], [formula] so 〈gY,X*〉 = 0. Expand

[formula]

Then

[formula]

This shows that a2 = 1 and b0 = 1 so

[formula]

Equations ([\ref=eqn-4.c]), ([\ref=eqn-4.d]), and ([\ref=eqn-4.e]) now imply Equation ([\ref=eqn-4.b]); the Lemma follows.

We now consider the double isotropy group

[formula]

[formula].

[formula] for 1  ≤  k  ≤  p.

[formula] for k = p + 1,p + 2.

[formula].

As noted above, the Jacobi form JX(  ·  ,  ·  ) = R(X,  ·  ,  ·  ,X) defines a non-singular bilinear form of signature (p + 1,p + 1) on

[formula]

Let O(W,JX) be the associated orthogonal group. If [formula], then we have gW = W by Equation ([\ref=eqn-4.d]). Since gX = X, we may safely identify g with g|W. Furthermore,

[formula]

Conversely, if g is a linear map of W which preserves JX, we may extend g to [formula] by defining gX = X and thereby obtain an element of [formula]. Thus [formula]. Assertion (1) now follows since

[formula]

Assertions (2) and (3) will follow from Lemma [\ref=lem-3.2] and from the relations:

[formula]

If ξ∈W, let [formula]. Expand

[formula]

We then have that

[formula]

Thus Sξ = 0 if and only if b0  =  〈ξ,Y*〉 = 0. It now follows that for [formula] we have

[formula]

Since a = 1, the analysis used to prove Lemma [\ref=lem-4.2] shows (b0)p + 3 = 1 if k = p + 1 and b0 = 1 if k = p + 2. This establishes the inclusions ⊂   in Equation ([\ref=eqn-4.f]).

We complete the proof by establishing the reverse inclusions in Equation ([\ref=eqn-4.f]). Expand ξ in the form given in Equation ([\ref=eqn-4.g]). Assume [formula]. Let gX = X, gY = ξ, g = (b0)- 1,

[formula]

The possibly non-zero components of R are then given by

[formula]

The non-zero components of [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  p are given by

[formula]

We therefore set εi = (b0)- i - 1 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  p to ensure [formula].

The non-zero components of [formula] for i = p + 1,p + 2 are

[formula]

If (b0)p + 3 = 1, then [formula]; if b0 = 1, then [formula]. This establishes the reverse inclusions in Equation ([\ref=eqn-4.f]) and completes the proof of Assertions (2) and (3); Assertion (4) is immediate.

Let [formula]. Let {β1,...,βp,1,...,p} be the corresponding dual basis for the dual space W(p): = W(p)*. The curvature tensor R(X,  ·  ,  ·  ,X) defines a non-degenerate form 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 on W(p); dually on W(p) we have:

[formula]

Let O(p) be the associated orthogonal group on W(p). Let

[formula]

be the simultaneous isotropy group. We set O(p,0) = O(p). Theorem [\ref=thm-1.5] will now follow from the following result:

Let 1  ≤  k  ≤  p.

[formula].

O1(p,k) = O(p - 1,k - 1).

dim {O(p,k)}  =   dim {O(p - 1,k - 1)} + 2p - k - 1.

[formula].

Let [formula]. Let [formula]. We may use Equation ([\ref=eqn-4.h]) and the relation R(X,Y,gξ,X) = R(X,Y,ξ,X), to see

[formula]

Consequently [formula] and the relation

[formula]

implies ai = aĩ = 0. Thus g  =   and g:W(p)  →  W(p); this shows that g is determined by its restriction to W(p). Let [formula] denote the dual action of g on W(p). The isomorphism of Assertion (1) now follows as:

[formula]

If h(β1) = β1 and h(1) = 1, then h preserves

[formula]

The isomorphism of Assertion (2) now follows by restricting h to this subspace and by renumbering the variables appropriately.

We set

[formula]

If h∈O(p,k), then h preserves 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 and h preserves {β1,...,βk}. Consequently h1∈W(p,k) as 1 satisfies these relations. Conversely, ξ∈W(p,k) if and only if

[formula]

Since the variables {b2,...,bp,k + 1,...,p} can be chosen arbitrarily,

[formula]

We show that ξ∈O(p,k)1 by finding h∈O(p,k) so h1  =  ξ. Set:

[formula]

This shows O(p,k)  ·  1  =  W(p,k). Assertion (3) now follows from Assertion (2) and from Lemma [\ref=lem-3.2].

As [formula], Assertion (4) follows by induction.
