Comparison of certain complexes of modules of generalized fractions and Cech complexes

R. Tajarod, H. Zakeri

Introduction

Throughout this note, A is a commutative Noetherian ring with non-zero identity and M is a finitely generated A-module.

One of the popular approaches to the construction of the local cohomology modules uses cohomology of Cech complexes. In this note we establish explicit isomorphisms between the homology modules of a given Cech complex of M and the corresponding homology modules of a certain complex of modules of generalized fractions. For a sequence [formula] of elements of A, we shall use [formula] to denote the Cech complex of M with respect to [formula]. The reader is referred, for example, to [\cite=bs] for the construction of Cech complexes. As we mentioned above, this note is also concerned with a certain complex [formula] of A-modules and A-homomorphisms which involves modules of generalized fractions derived from M and the sequence [formula]. The complex is described as follows: for each [formula] (throughout we use [formula] to denote the set of positive integers) set

[formula]

where xr is interpreted as xn whenever r > n. Then, for each [formula], U(x)i is a triangular subset [\cite=sz1] of Ai. We can [\cite=oc] form the complex

[formula]

of A-modules and A-homomorphisms, which we denote by [formula]. Here U(x)- iiM is the module of generalized fractions of M with respect to the triangular subset U(x)i of Ai, and the homomorphisms ei (for i  ≥  0) are given by the following formulas: [formula] for all b∈M and, for each [formula],

[formula]

for all b∈M and [formula].

It is well known that the homology modules of the complex [formula] are, up to A-isomorphisms, independent of the choice of sequence of generators for the ideal [formula].

Thus, to establish the main result of this note, without loss of generality, we may choose a better generating set for the ideal [formula]. Indeed, with that choice of [formula] (see proposition [\ref=prop12]), we will establish a quasi-isomorphism from the complex [formula] to the complex [formula], which is homogeneous in the graded situation. This result provides, perhaps, a simpler method to compute the homology modules of the the Cech complex [formula].

The results

Throughout this paper [formula] is an ideal of A. For a submodule N of M, we set

[formula]

We recall the definition of a filter regular sequence. A sequence [formula] of elements of [formula] is called an [formula]-filter regular sequence on M if

[formula]

for all 0  ≤  i < n. When such property holds in any order, we will say that the sequence [formula] forms an unconditioned [formula]-filter regular sequence on M. Note that [formula] is a poor M-sequence [\cite=sz1] if and only if it is an A-filter regular sequence on M. Also, note that if [formula] is an [formula]-filter regular sequence on M, then [formula] is a poor Mxn-sequence, where Mxn is the ordinary localization of M with respect to xn.

The following characterization of filter regular sequences is included here for the reader's convenience.

[\cite=ns] Let [formula] be a sequence of elements of [formula]. Then the following statements are equivalent:

(i) [formula] is an [formula]-filter regular sequence on M.

(ii) [formula] is a poor MP-sequence for all P∈Supp(M) with [formula].

(iii) [formula] is an [formula]-filter regular sequence on M for all positive integers [formula].

As we mentioned in the introduction, to prove the main result of this note, we need to choose a better generating set for the ideal [formula]. The following proposition indicates the choice.

Suppose that [formula] is generated by n elements. Then [formula] has a sequence of generators of length n which forms an unconditioned [formula]-filter regular sequence on M.

Let [formula]. Suppose, inductively, that i is an integer with 0  ≤  i  <  n and it has been proved that there exists an unconditioned [formula]-filter regular sequence on M of length i, say [formula], such that [formula]. This is certainly the case when i = 0. Set

[formula]

Then, by [\cite=ka], there exists [formula] such that [formula] and that

[formula]

Now, it follows from [\cite=ks] that [formula] is an unconditioned [formula]-filter regular sequence on M. This completes the inductive step and the result is proved by induction.

Let [formula] be a sequence of elements of A and let [formula]. Write the complexes [formula]. and [formula] as

[formula]

and

[formula]

respectively. Note that, in view of [\cite=sz1] and [\cite=sz2], U(x)- iiM  =  0 for all i  >  n. For each [formula], there is an A-homomorphism

[formula]

which is such that, for all m∈M and [formula],

[formula]

Let θ0x be the identity map of M and put θix  =  0 for all i  >  n. Then

[formula]

is a homomorphism of complexes. For each i  ≥  0, let [formula] denote the homomorphism induced by Θx.

θn *x is an isomorphism.

Clearly θn *x is surjective. Suppose that a∈M and [formula] are such that

[formula]

Then there exist b∈M and [formula] such that

[formula]

in U(x)- nnM. Hence, by [\cite=oc], there exists [formula] with δ  ≥   max {α,β} such that

[formula]

for some [formula]. Therefore, in C(x,M)n, we have

[formula]

where the character with      means that it is deleted, as required.

As we have mentioned in the introduction, the main purpose of this note is to establish a quasi-isomorphism from the complex [formula] to a certain complex of modules of generalized fractions. Since the homology modules of [formula] are independent of the choice of sequence of generators for the ideal [formula], we may assume, in view of the proposition [\ref=prop12], that [formula] is an [formula]-filter regular sequence on M. Indeed, under such assumption, we shall prove, by induction, that Θx is a quasi-isomorphism. The next lemma provides a basis for that induction.

Let x1,x2 be an [formula]-filter regular sequence on M. Then Θx is a quasi-isomorphism.

In view of lemma [\ref=lemma13], the only non-trivial point is the proof that θ1 *x is an isomorphism. To show that θ1 *x is injective, let [formula]. Then, in view of [\cite=oc], there exist [formula] and b∈M such that

[formula]

Now, since x1,x2 is an [formula]-filter regular sequence on M, it follows from [\eqref=eq-1], in view of proposition [\ref=prop11], that [formula] for some [formula]. Next, since [formula], we have [formula] for some [formula]. Now, let ν  =   max {η,β}. Then, using the above formulas and proposition [\ref=prop11], it is easy to see that

[formula]

for some [formula]. Now, it follows from [\eqref=eq-1] and [\eqref=eq-2] that [formula]. Therefore Ker(θ1 *x) = 0.

Next we show that θ1 *x is surjective. To do this, let [formula]. Then, by [\cite=oc], there exist [formula] with δ  ≥  α and b∈M such that xδ  -  α1xδa2  =  xδb1. Let [formula]. Then Y∈Ker  f1 and [formula], as required.

Next, we establish the main result of this note. In the course of the proof of that result we shall need to use some local cohomology theory. For i  ≥  0, we use [formula] to denote the i-th right derived functor of the local cohomology functor with respect to an ideal [formula] of A. Also, for a complex X of A-modules and A-homomorphisms, we use Hi(X) to denote the i-th homology module of X.

Let [formula] and suppose that [formula] is an [formula]-filter regular sequence on M. Then, with the above notations,

[formula]

is a quasi-isomorphism.

The proof will appear elsewhere.

It should be observed that if M is a graded module over the graded ring A and U is a triangular subset of An composed of homogeneous elements, then the module U- nM of generalized fractions has graded structure as an A-module (see [\cite=en]) which is such that, for a homogeneous element b∈M and [formula], the degree of the fraction [formula] is [formula]. Thus, for an ideal [formula] of A, if [formula] is a homogeneous [formula]-filter regular sequence on M, then the homology modules of the complex [formula] have graded modules structure. On the other hand, it is standard to use the graded Cech complex [formula] to define a grading on the local cohomology module [formula], for i  ≥  0. However, since the quasi-isomorphism [formula] is homogeneous, the resulting gradings are always the same. Therefore one can compute the graded local cohomology modules [formula] via modules of generalized fractions which is perhaps simpler than the use of Cech complex.

The terms of the Cech complex [formula] has the vanishing properties [formula] for all i  ≥  1 and all k. The following theorem, which describes the behaviour of certain fraction formation along exact sequences, provides similar vanishing properties for the complex [formula].

Let [formula] be an exact sequence of A-modules and A-homomorphisms and let Un be a triangular subset of An such that, for each [formula], the sequence [formula] is an [formula]-filter regular sequence on N'' and [formula]. Then the sequence

[formula]

is exact.

Let [formula]. In view of [\cite=sz1], it is enough to show that U- nnf is injective whenever [formula]. We achieve this by induction on n(  ≥  1). The case n  =  1 is clear. Suppose, inductively, that n  ≥  2 and the result has been proved for n - 1. Let m'∈N' and [formula] be such that

[formula]

in U- nnN. Then, by [\cite=oc], there exists [formula] with δ  ≥  α and [formula] such that [formula]. Next, using the above equality in conjuction with the notion of filter regular sequence, one can see that [formula] for some c∈N' and [formula]. It therefore follows that

[formula]

Hence, in view of [\cite=sz1] and the inductive hypothesis,

[formula]

in U- n + 1n - 1N'. Thus [formula] by [\cite=sz2], as required.

Consider a finite free resolution for M and use the natural equivalence of functors [formula] in conjunction with theorem [\ref=thm17] to deduce the result.
