Family Dependence in [formula] models

Introduction

A very common alternative to solve some of the problems of the standard model (SM) consists on enlarging the gauge symmetry. For instance, the SU(5) grand unification model of Georgi and Glashow [\cite=seven] can unify the interactions and predicts the electric charge quantization; while the group E6 can also unifies the interactions and might explain the masses of the neutrinos [\cite=nine]. Nevertheless, such models cannot explain the origin of the fermion families. Some models with larger symmetries address this problem [\cite=familia] [\cite=Frampton2]. A very interesting alternative to explain the origin of generations comes from the cancellation of chiral anomalies [\cite=anomalias]. In particular, models with gauge symmetry [formula] also called 331 models, arise as a possible solution to this puzzle, where the three families are required in order to cancel chiral anomalies completely. An additional motivation to study these kind of models comes from the fact that they can also predict the charge quantization for a three family model even when neutrino masses are added [\cite=Pires].

Although cancellation of anomalies leads to some required conditions [\cite=fourteen], such criterion alone still permits an infinite number of 331 models. In these models, the electric charge is defined in general as a linear combination of the diagonal generators of the group

[formula]

As it has been studied in the literature [\cite=fourteen] [\cite=ten], the value of the β parameter determines the fermion assignment, and more specifically, the electric charges of the exotic spectrum. Hence, it is customary to use this quantum number to classify the different 331 models. If we want to avoid exotic charges we are led to only two different models i.e. [formula] [\cite=fourteen] [\cite=twelve].

It has been recently obtained in ref [\cite=331us] constraints to 331 models by examining the scalar sector. In summary, these constraints are obtained by requiring gauge invariance in the Yukawa sector and finding the possible vacuum alignment structures that respect the symmetry breaking pattern and provides the fermions and gauge bosons of the SM with the appropriate masses. By applying gauge invariance to the Yukawa lagrangian it is found that the Higgs bosons should lie in either a triplet, antitriplet, singlet or sextet representation of [formula]. On the other hand, cancellation of chiral anomalies demands that the number of fermionic triplets and antitriplets must be equal [\cite=doff]. Moreover, assuming the symmetry breaking pattern [formula] [formula] we see that one triplet is necessary for the first symmetry breaking and two triplets for the second in order to give mass to the up and down quark sector. In some cases it is necessary to introduce a scalar sextet to give masses to the neutrinos [\cite=ten].

The group structure of these models leads, along with the SM neutral boson Z, to the prediction of an additional current associated with a new neutral boson [formula] Unlike Z-boson whose couplings are family independent and the weak interactions at low energy are of universal character, the couplings of [formula] are different for the three families due to the U(1)X values to each of them. Through the [formula] mixing it is possible to study the low energy deviations of the Z couplings to the SM families [\cite=ten] [\cite=Carena] [\cite=Frampton]. In the quark sector each 331-family in the weak basis can be assigned in three different ways into mass eigenstates. In this way in a phenomenological analysis, the allowed region associated with the [formula] mixing angle and the physical mass MZ2 of the extra neutral boson will depend on the family assignment to the mass states.

In this work we report a phenomenological study through a χ2 fit at the Z-pole to find the allowed region for the mixing angle between the neutral gauge bosons [formula] and the mass of the Z2 boson at 95% CL for three different assignments of the quark families [\cite=Mohapatra]. We take into account the two main versions of the 331 models from the literature [\cite=ten] [\cite=twelve], which correspond to [formula] and [formula] respectively.

This paper is organized as follows. Section [\ref=sec:331-spectrum] is devoted to summarize the Fermion, Scalar and Vector boson representations. In section [\ref=sec:neutral-currents] we describe the neutral currents and the vector and axial vector couplings of the model. In section [\ref=sec:z-pole] we perform the χ2 analysis at the Z-pole including atomic parity violation at 95% CL. Finally, section [\ref=conclusions] contains our conclusions.

The 331 spectrum

The fermionic spectrum under [formula] [formula] is shown in table [\ref=tab:espectro] for three families with [formula] and [formula] where the first case contains the Long model [\cite=twelve] and the second contains the bilepton model proposed by Pisano, Pleitez and Frampton [\cite=ten]. We recognize three different possibilities to assign the physical quarks in each family representation as it is shown in table [\ref=tab:combination]. At low energy, the three models from table [\ref=tab:combination] are equivalent and there are not any phenomenological feature that allow us to detect differences between them. In fact, they must reduce to the SM which is an universal family model in SU(2)L. However, through the couplings of the three families to the additional neutral current ([formula]) and the introduction of a mixing angle between Z and [formula] it is possible to recognize differences among the three models at the electroweak scale. It is noted that although we write the spectrum in the weak basis in table [\ref=tab:espectro], we can consider three realizations in the mass basis in table [\ref=tab:combination].

For the scalar sector, we introduce the triplet field χ with Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV) [formula], which induces the masses to the third fermionic components. In the second transition it is necessary to introduce two triplets  ρ and η with VEV [formula] and [formula] in order to give masses to the quarks of type up and down respectively.

In the gauge boson spectrum associated with the group [formula] we are just interested in the physical neutral sector that corresponds to the photon, Z and [formula] which are written in terms of the electroweak basis for [formula] and [formula] as [\cite=beta-arbitrario]

[formula]

and with eigenvalues

[formula]

where the Weinberg angle is defined as

[formula]

and g, [formula] correspond to the coupling constants of the groups SU(3)L and U(1)X respectively. Further, a small mixing angle between the two neutral currents Zμ and [formula] appears with the following mass eigenstates

[formula]

Neutral currents

Using the fermionic content from table [\ref=tab:espectro], we obtain the neutral coupling for the SM fermions

[formula]

where Qj with j = 1,2,3 has been written in a SM-like notation i.e. it refers to triplets of quarks associated with the three generations of quarks (SM does not make difference in the family representations). On the other hand, the coupling of the exotic gauge boson ([formula]) with the two former families are different from the ones involving the third family. This is because the third familiy transforms differently as it was remarked in table [\ref=tab:espectro]. Consequently, there are terms where only the components m = 1,2 are summed, leaving the third one in a term apart. Qqj are the electric charges. The Gell-Mann matrices T3 [formula] and [formula] are introduced in the notation. We also define [formula], [formula] and the projectors [formula] Finally, [formula] denote the leptonic triplets with [formula] denoting their electric charges and Λ3 = diag(1,1,2Q1) with Q1 = 0, - 1 for [formula] respectively.

The neutral lagrangian ([\ref=lag-1]) can be written as

[formula]

with the vector and axial vector couplings given by

[formula]

where f = Qj, [formula] in the first line. It is noted that gfV,A are the same as the SM definitions and [formula]are new β-dependent couplings of [formula] (i.e. model dependent), whose values also depend on the family realization from table [\ref=tab:combination]. On the other hand, there is a small mixing angle between Zμ and [formula] given by Eq. ([\ref=mix]), where Z1μ is the SM-like neutral boson and Z2μ the exotic ones. Taking a very small angle, we can do Cθ≃1 so that the lagrangian ([\ref=lag-2]) becomes

[formula]

where the couplings associated with Z1μ are

[formula]

and the couplings associated with Z2μ are

[formula]

Z-Pole Observables

The couplings of the Z1μ in eq. ([\ref=lag-3]) have the same form as the SM neutral couplings but by replacing the vector and axial vector couplings gSMV,A by GV,A = gSMV,A  +  δgV,A, where δgV,A (given by eq. ([\ref=coup2])) is a correction due to the small [formula] mixing angle θ. For this reason all the analytical parameters at the Z pole have the same SM-form but with small correction factors that depend on the family assignment. The partial decay widths of Z1 into fermions [formula] is described by [\cite=one] [\cite=pitch]:

[formula]

where Nfc = 1, 3 for leptons and quarks respectively, RQED,QCD are global final-state QED and QCD corrections, and [formula] considers kinematic corrections only important for the b-quark. Universal electroweak corrections sensitive to the top quark mass are taken into account in ρf = 1 + ρt and in gSMV which is written in terms of an effective Weinberg angle [\cite=one]

[formula]

with [formula]. Non-universal vertex corrections are also taken into account in the [formula] vertex with additional one-loop leading terms given by [\cite=one] [\cite=pitch]

[formula]

Table [\ref=tab:observables] resumes some observables, with their experimental values from CERN collider (LEP), SLAC Liner Collider (SLC) and data from atomic parity violation [\cite=one], the SM predictions and the expressions predicted by 331 models. We use MZ1 = 91.1876 GeV, mt = 176.9 GeV, S2W = 0.2314, and for mb we use [\cite=greub]

with mb  ≈  4.5 GeV the pole mass, [formula] the running mass at MZ1 scale in the [formula] scheme, and αS(MZ1) = 0.1213  ±  0.0018 the strong coupling constant.

The 331 predictions from table [\ref=tab:observables] are expressed in terms of SM values corrected by

[formula]

where for the light fermions

[formula]

while for the b-quark

[formula]

The above expressions are evaluated in terms of the effective Weinberg angle from eq. ([\ref=effective-angle]).

For the predicted SM partial decay given by ([\ref=partial-decay]), we use the following values taken from ref. [\cite=one]

[formula]

The weak charge is written as

[formula]

where [formula]. The deviation ΔQW is [\cite=cesio]

[formula]

and [formula] which contains new physics gives

[formula]

For Cesium we have Z = 55, N = 78, and for the first term in ([\ref=dev]) we take the value [formula] [\cite=cesio]. With the definitions in eq. ([\ref=coup1]) for [formula] and [formula], we displays in table [\ref=tab:weak-charge] the new physics corrections to ΔQW given by eq. ([\ref=new]) for each representation of quarks listed in table [\ref=tab:combination]. We get the same correction for the spectrum A and B due to the fact that the weak charge depends mostly on the up-down quarks, and A,B-cases maintain the same representation for this family.

With the expressions for the Z-pole observables and the experimental data shown in table [\ref=tab:observables], we perform a χ2 fit for each representation A,B and C at 95% CL, which will allow us to display the family dependence in the model. We find the best allowed region in the plane MZ2 - Sθ. Figure 1 displays three cases for [formula], each one corresponding to the family representations from table [\ref=tab:combination] respectively, exhibiting family-dependent regions. The bounds for MZ2 and Sθ are shown in table [\ref=tab:bound-1] for each family-choices. We can see that the lowest bound for MZ2 is about 1400 GeV for models A and B, while model C with the lightest family defined in the third multiplet increases this bound to 2100 GeV. It is also noted that the A and B representations yield broader allowed regions for the mixing angle that model C, showing that the family choices is a fundamental issue in the phenomenology of 331 models. A-region and B-region are very similar because they present the same weak corrections, as it is shown in table [\ref=tab:weak-charge]; the small differences arise mostly due to the bottom correction in eq. ([\ref=shift3]). The table [\ref=tab:weak-charge] also shows that the C-region contribute to the new physics correction with a contrary sign respect A and B corrections.

For [formula], we get the regions in figure 2, which also compares the three family choices. This model increases the lowest bound in the MZ2 value to 4000 GeV for the A and B spectrums, and to 10000 GeV for the C spectrum. In this case A and B regions are equivalent. The table [\ref=tab:bound-2] displays the bounds for the mixing angle and MZ2. We can see that the mixing angle is smaller in about one order of magnitude that the angle predicted by [formula] model. These differences between both models arise mostly because they present variations to the weak charge corrections (see table [\ref=tab:weak-charge]).

Conclusions

The [formula] [formula] models for three families with [formula] and [formula] corresponding to the Long [\cite=twelve] and Pisano-Pleitez-Frampton bilepton models [\cite=ten] respectively, were studied under the framework of family dependence.

As it is shown in table [\ref=tab:combination], we found three different assignments of quarks into the mass family basis. Each assignment determines different weak couplings of the quarks to the extra neutral current associated to Z2, which holds a small angle mixing with respect to the SM-neutral current associated to Z1. This mixing gives different allowed regions in the MZ2 - Sθ plane for the LEP parameters at the Z-pole and including data from the atomic parity violation.

Performing a χ2 fit at 95% CL we found for the Long model that MZ2  ≥  1400 when - 0.9  ×  10- 3  ≤  Sθ  ≤  2  ×  10- 3 for A and B assignments, and MZ2  ≥  2100 when - 0.9  ×  10- 3  ≤  Sθ  ≤  0.9  ×  10- 3 for C assignment. For the Pleitez model we got MZ2  ≥  4000 for - 1.2  ×  10- 4  ≤  Sθ  ≤  1.7  ×  10- 4, and MZ2  ≥  10000 for - 1.2  ×  10- 4  ≤  Sθ  ≤  1.2  ×  10- 4 for each case.

Unlike the SM where the family assignment is arbitrary without any phenomenological change, our results show how this assignment yields differences in the numerical predictions for two 331 models. We see that the lowest bound for MZ2 is higher than those obtained by other authors for one family models [\cite=fourteen]. Due to the restriction of the data from the atomic parity violation, we are getting a differences of about one order of magnitude in the lowest bound for the MZ2. In addition we found that the bounds associated with the angle mixing is highly suppressed (~   10- 4) in the Pleitez model when the lightest quarks family transform differently respect the two heavier families.

This study can be extended if we consider linear combinations among the three familiy assignments according to the ansatz of the quarks mass matrix in agreement with the physical mass and mixing angle mass. In this case, the allowed regions for MZ2 Vs Sθ would be a combination among the regions obtained for A, B and C models.
