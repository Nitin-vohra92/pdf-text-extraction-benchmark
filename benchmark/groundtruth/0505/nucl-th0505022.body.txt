Experimental data on the energy level displacement of the ground state of kaonic hydrogen

The contemporary experimental and theoretical status of kaonic atoms has been recently outlined by Jürg Gasser [\cite=JG04]. The most recent experimental value on the energy level displacement of the ground state of kaonic hydrogen

[formula]

obtained by the DEAR Collaboration [\cite=DEAR], by a factor 2 smaller than the experimental value measured by the KEK Collaboration [\cite=KEK]

[formula]

For the theoretical analysis of the experimental data on the energy level displacement of the ground state of kaonic hydrogen, obtained by the DEAR Collaboration Eq.([\ref=label1]), we have proposed a phenomenological quantum field theoretic model of strong low-energy qN interactions at threshold [\cite=IV3].

Phenomenological quantum field theoretic model for qN interactions at threshold

In Ref.[\cite=IV3] (see also [\cite=IV4]) we have proposed a phenomenological quantum field theoretic model for strong low-energy qN interactions at threshold and calculated the complex S-wave scattering lengths ã00 and ã10 of qN scattering with isospin I  =  0 and I  =  1:

[formula]

The S-wave amplitude of K-p scattering at threshold is equal to [\cite=IV3]:

[formula]

The theoretical value for the energy level displacement of the ground state of kaonic hydrogen is defined by the DGBTT formula (the Deser-Goldberger-Baumann-Thirring-Trueman formula [\cite=DT54]):

[formula]

Here 2α3μ2  =  421  eV  /  fm, where μ  =  mKmp / (mK  +  mp)  =  324  MeV is the reduced mass of the K-p pair, calculated for mK  =  494  MeV and mp  =  940  MeV, and α  =  1 / 137.036 is the fine-structure constant [\cite=PDG04].

The theoretical values of the energy level shift and width Eq.([\ref=label4]) agree well with the experimental data by the DEAR Collaboration [\cite=DEAR] Eq.([\ref=label1]) and only qualitatively with the experimental data by the KEK Collaboration [\cite=KEK].

The theoretical ground for our model of low-energy qN interactions is a phenomenological Effective Field Theory with Effective Chiral Lagrangians and Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) by Gasser and Leutwyler [\cite=JG83]-[\cite=UM01].

In our model of strong low-energy qN interactions near threshold proposed in [\cite=IV3] [\cite=IV4] the imaginary part of the S-wave amplitude of K-p scattering is defined by the contributions of the strange baryon resonance Λ(1405) and the baryon background with quantum numbers of resonances Λ(1800) and Σ(1750) . According to Gell-Mann's SU(3) classification of hadrons, the Λ(1405) resonance is an SU(3) singlet, whereas the resonances Λ(1800) and Σ(1750) are components of an SU(3) octet [\cite=PDG04]. This allows to describe the experimental data on the cross sections for the inelastic reactions K-p  →  Yπ, where Yπ  =  Σ-π+, Σ+π-, Σ0π0 and Λ0π0, at threshold of K-p scattering [\cite=DT71] [\cite=RN78]

[formula]

with an accuracy of about 6  % [\cite=IV3] and the constraint that the Λ(1800) resonance decouples from the K-p system at low energies. We would like to emphasize that for the description of the experimental data Eq.([\ref=label6]) we have not specified the values of the parameters of resonances. We have satisfied the experimental data by using only the SU(3) properties of the resonances Λ(1405), Λ(1800) and Σ(1750)1.

Due to the optical theorem and using the experimental data Eq.([\ref=label6]) the imaginary part Im  fK-p0(0) of the S-wave amplitude of K-p scattering can be expressed in terms of the parameters γ and Rc and the S-wave amplitude f(K-p  →  Σ-π+) of the inelastic channel K-p  →  Σ-π+ [\cite=IV3]:

[formula]

where kΣ-π+  =  173.85  MeV is a relative momentum of the Σ-π+ pair at threshold of K-p scattering.

In our model for the calculation of the amplitude f(K-p  →  Σ-π+) one needs two input parameters g1 and g2, the coupling constants of the interactions Λ(1405) and Σ(1750) with B  =  (N,Σ,Λ0,Ξ) and P  =  (π,K,q,η(550)), the octets of low-lying baryons and pseudoscalar mesons. The coupling constants g1  =  0.907 and g2  =  1.123 have been calculated in [\cite=IV3], using the recommended values for masses and widths of the resonances Λ(1405) and Σ(1750) and physical masses of baryons and pseudoscalar mesons [\cite=PDG04].

The real part Re  fK-p0(0) of the S-wave amplitude of K-p scattering at threshold, i.e. the S-wave scattering length Re  fK-p0(0)  =  aK-p0 of K-p scattering,

[formula]

is defined by the contribution (i) of the strange baryon resonances in the s-channel of low-energy elastic K-p scattering, which we denote as Re  fK-p0(0)R, (ii) of the exotic four-quark (or Kq molecules) scalar states a0(980) and f0(980) in the t-channel of low-energy elastic K-p scattering and (iii) of hadrons with non-exotic quark structures, i.e. q for mesons and qqq for baryons [\cite=PDG04], where q  =  u,d or s quarks, which we denote as Re  K-p0(0).

The contribution of the strange resonances Re  fK-p0(0)R  =  ( - 0.154  ±  0.009)  fm explains 32  % of the mean value of the S-wave scattering length of K-p scattering [\cite=IV3]: Re  fK-p0(0) = ( -   0.482  ±  0.034)  fm.

The contribution of the exotic scalar mesons a0(980) and f0(980) and non-exotic hadrons, calculated to leading order in chiral expansion, is equal to [\cite=IV3]

[formula]

where the first term is defined by strong low-energy interactions of non-exotic hadrons, whereas the second one is caused by the exotic scalar mesons a0(980) and f0(980) coupled to the K--meson and the proton. The parameter ξ is a low-energy constant (LEC), defining low-energy a0(980)NN and f0(980)NN interactions.

Using the hypothesis of quark-hadron duality, formulated by Shifman, Veinshtein and Zakharov within non-perturbative QCD in the form of the QCD sum rules [\cite=VZ79], and the Effective quark model with chiral U(3)  ×  U(3) symmetry [\cite=AI99], we have calculated the parameter ξ [\cite=IV3]: ξ  =  1.2  ±  0.1.

The validity of the application of the Effective quark model with chiral U(3)  ×  U(3) symmetry [\cite=AI99] to the quantitative analysis of strong low-energy qN interactions at threshold has been corroborated by example of the calculation of the S-wave scattering length of elastic K-n scattering in connection with the calculation of the energy level displacement of the ground state of kaonic deuterium [\cite=IV4].

For the description of the contributions of the strange baryon resonances Λ(1405), Λ(1800) and Σ(1750) and the exotic scalar mesons a0(980) and f0(980) we have used Effective Chiral Lagrangians with Λ(1405), Λ(1800), Σ(1750), a0(980) and f0(980) treated as elementary particles and represented by local interpolating fields. Such a description of baryon resonances and exotic mesons does not contradict ChPT by Gasser and Leutwyler [\cite=JG83] and power counting [\cite=MR96]-[\cite=UM01]. As has been pointed out in [\cite=MR96], the inclusion of the resonance Λ(1405) as well as Λ(1800) and Σ(1750) as elementary particle fields allows to calculate the amplitudes of qN scattering at threshold to leading order Effective Chiral Lagrangians.

Energy level displacement of the excited nP states of kaonic hydrogen

The application of our model of strong low-energy qN interactions at threshold [\cite=IV3] [\cite=IV4] to the description of K-p scattering in the P-wave state has led to the following value of the energy level displacement of the excited nP states of kaonic hydrogen [\cite=IV5]

[formula]

with ε2p  =    -    0.6  meV and Γ2p  =  2  meV.

Faifman and Men'shikov have presented the calculated yields for the K-series of X-rays for kaonic hydrogen in dependence of the hydrogen density [\cite=MF05]. They have shown that the use of the theoretical value Γ2p  =  2  meV of the width of the 2p state of kaonic hydrogen, calculated in our model, leads to good agreement with the experimental data, measured for the Kα-line by the KEK Collaboration [\cite=KEK]. They have also shown that the results of cascade calculations with other values of the width of the 2p excited state of kaonic hydrogen, used as an input parameter, disagree with the available experimental data. The results obtained by Faifman and Men'shikov contradict to those by Jensen and Markushin [\cite=XR7]. Therefore, as has been accentuated by Faifman and Men'shikov [\cite=MF05], the further analysis of the experimental data by the DEAR Collaboration should allow to perform a more detailed comparison of the theoretical value Γ2p  =  2  meV with other phenomenological values of the width of the 2p state of kaonic hydrogen Γ2p, used as input parameters.

Radiative transitions nP  →  1S  +  γ in kaonic hydrogen and kaonic deuterium, caused by strong low-energy interactions

The analysis of the transitions (K-p)np  →  (K-p)1s  +  γ, induced by strong low-energy interactions and enhanced by the Coulomb interaction of the K-p pair in the initial and final state of the amplitude of the kaon-proton Bremsstrahlung K-  +  p  →  K-  +  p  +  γ, has led to the transition rate [\cite=IV6]:

[formula]

where the transition rate Γ((K-p)2p  →  (K-p)1s  γ) is defined in terms of the energy level displacement of the ground state of kaonic hydrogen:

[formula]

The parameters ξ1s and [formula] are the overlap integrals of the Coulomb wave functions of the bound and scattering states of the K-p pairs [\cite=IV6].

For kaonic deuterium we have obtained the following transition rate [\cite=IV6]:

[formula]

Measurements of the energy level displacements of the ground states for kaonic atoms at the eV level would demand to take into account the transition rates (K-p)np  →  (K-p)1s  +  γ and (K-d)np  →  (K-d)1s  +  γ, given by Eqs.([\ref=label12]) and ([\ref=label13]), for the theoretical description of the experimental data on the X-ray spectra and yields.

Isospin-breaking and dispersive corrections to the energy level displacement of the ground state of kaonic hydrogen

In [\cite=IV7] we have applied our model of strong low-energy qN interactions at threshold to the analysis of isospin-breaking corrections to the S-wave amplitude of K-p scattering [\cite=IV7], caused by the QCD isospin-breaking interaction [\cite=JG75] [\cite=JG82]

[formula]

We have shown that these corrections are of order O(α) and make up about 0.04  %. Our results agree well with the estimates, obtained by Meiß ner et al. [\cite=UM04] within a systematic analysis of isospin-breaking corrections in the framework of a non-relativistic Effective Field Theory based on ChPT by Gasser and Leutwyler [\cite=JG83].

In our model of strong low-energy qN interactions we have derived the formula for the energy level displacement of the ground state of kaonic hydrogen [\cite=IV3] [\cite=IV4] [\cite=IV5] [\cite=IV6] [\cite=IV7]

[formula]

where [formula] is the S-wave amplitude of K-p scattering, [formula] and [formula] are the wave functions of the ground state of kaonic hydrogen in the momentum representation normalized to unity: [formula]; aB  =  1 / αμ  =  83.6  fm is the Bohr radius. The formula for the energy level displacements of the excited [formula] states of kaonic hydrogen analogous to Eq.([\ref=label15]) has been derived in [\cite=IV5].

Inserting the intermediate q0n state on-mass shell, i.e. taking into account the transition K-p  →  q0n  →  K-p, and keeping the observable mass differences of the neutral and charged K mesons and the neutron and the proton, we have calculated the dispersive corrections to the energy level displacement of the ground state of kaonic hydrogen [\cite=IV7]

[formula]

where [formula] [\cite=PDG04] and Im  fK-p0(0)  =  (0.269  ±  0.032)  fm [\cite=IV3]. The parameter 2 / |a00  +  a10|  =  (409  ±  29)  MeV, appearing in the argument of the logarithm [formula] in Eq.([\ref=label16]), has a meaning of a natural cut-off, introduced by the final-state q0n interaction [\cite=IV7]. Such corrections have not been calculated before in literature.

Energy level shift of the ground state of kaonic hydrogen and the σI  =  1KN(0)-term

In our approach the S-wave amplitude of K-p scattering is calculated to leading order in chiral expansion [\cite=IV3]. This allows to take into account next-to-leading corrections in chiral expansions such as the σ(I  =  1)KN(0)-term, defined by [\cite=ER72]-[\cite=JG99]

[formula]

where mu and ms are masses and u(0) and s(0) are operators of the interpolating fields of u and s current quarks.

The contribution of the σ(I  =  1)KN(0)-term to the energy level shift is equal to [\cite=IV5] [\cite=IV7]

[formula]

where J4  ±  i550(x) are time-components of the axial hadronic currents J4  ±  i55μ(x), changing strangeness |ΔS|  =  1, FK  =  113  MeV is the PCAC constant of the K-meson [\cite=PDG04].

The correction δε(σ)1s to the shift of the energy level of the ground state of kaonic hydrogen, caused by the σ(I  =  1)KN(0), is obtained from the S-wave amplitude of K-p scattering, calculated to next-to-leading order in ChPT expansion at the tree-hadron level [\cite=IV5] and Current Algebra [\cite=ER72]:

[formula]

Since the first term, mK / F2K, calculated to leading order in chiral expansion, has been already taken into account in [\cite=IV3], the second term, -  σ(I  =  1)KN(0) / F2K, and the third one define next-to-leading order corrections in chiral expansion to the S-wave amplitude of K-p scattering at threshold.

Taking into account the contribution δε(σ)1s, the total shift of the energy level of the ground state of kaonic hydrogen is equal to [\cite=IV5] [\cite=IV7]:

[formula]

The theoretical estimates of the value of σ(I  =  1)KN(0), carried out within Effective Field Theory approach based on ChPT with a dimensional regularization of divergent integrals, are converged around the number σ(I  =  1)KN(0)  =  (200  ±  50)  MeV [\cite=VB93] [\cite=BB99]. Hence, the contribution of σ(I  =  1)KN(0) to the energy level shift amounts to

[formula]

Substituting Eq.([\ref=label21]) into Eq.([\ref=label20]) we obtain the total shift of the energy level of the ground state of kaonic hydrogen equal to

[formula]

The theoretical analysis of the second term in Eq.([\ref=label22]) is required for the correct understanding of the contribution of the σI  =  1KN(0)-term to the shift of the energy level of the ground state of kaonic hydrogen.

Of course, one can solve the inverse problem. Indeed, carrying out a theoretical calculation of the term

[formula]

in Eq.([\ref=label20]) and using the experimental data on the shift of the energy level of the ground state of kaonic hydrogen, measured by the DEAR Collaboration, one can extract the value of the σ(I  =  1)KN(0)-term. Such a value of the σ(I  =  1)KN(0)-term should be compared with the theoretical predictions, obtained within the Effective Field Theory approach based on ChPT by Gasser and Leutwyler.

Kaonic deuterium

The energy level displacement of the ground state of kaonic deuterium is given by the DGBTT formula [\cite=DT54] (see also [\cite=IV4]):

[formula]

where μ  =  mKmd / (mk  +  md)  =  391  MeV is the reduced mass of the K-d pair for mK  =  494  MeV and md  =  1876  MeV and fK-d0(0) is the S-wave amplitude of K-d scattering at threshold.

In our model of strong low-energy qN interactions [\cite=IV4] we have shown that the S-wave scattering length Re  fK-d0(0)  =  aK-d0 of K-d scattering is fully defined by the Ericson-Weise scattering length for K-d scattering in the S-wave state [\cite=TE88], which we denote as (aK-d0)EW, i.e. aK-d0≃(aK-d0)EW. The S-wave scattering length (aK-d0)EW is equal to [\cite=IV4]

[formula]

where r12 is a distance between two scatterers n and p [\cite=TE88]. In our approach 〈1 / r12〉 is defined by [\cite=IV4]

[formula]

where [formula] is the wave function of the deuteron in the ground state.

We would like to remind that Ericson and Weise did not investigate the S-wave scattering length of K-d scattering. They analysed only π-d scattering. However, since the structure of the term Eq.([\ref=label25]) is very similar to that of π-d scattering we call such a term as the Ericson-Weise scattering length (aK-d0)EW. At the quantum field theoretic level the Ericson-Weise scattering length has been derived in [\cite=IV4].

The imaginary part Im  fK-d0(0) of the S-wave amplitude of K-d scattering at threshold we have calculated in terms of the contributions of the two-body reactions K-d  →  NY, where NY  =  nΛ0, nΣ0 and pΣ-, and the experimental data on the two-body production rates [\cite=VV70]. Our theoretical predictions for the ratios of the two-body production rates [\cite=IV4]

[formula]

agree well with the experimental data [\cite=VV70]

[formula]

The experimental data on the production rates R(K-d  →  NY) are [\cite=VV70]

[formula]

The theoretical values of the partial widths of two-body inelastic decay channels K-d  →  NY, obtained in our model, are equal to [\cite=IV4]

[formula]

Using the experimental value of the total production rate R  =  (1.229  ±  0.090)  % and our theoretical predictions for the widths of the two-body decay channels ([\ref=label30]), we can estimate the expected value of the total width of the ground state of kaonic deuterium

[formula]

The S-wave amplitude of K-d scattering at threshold is equal to [\cite=IV4]:

[formula]

Our prediction for the energy level displacement of the ground state of kaonic deuterium [\cite=IV4]

[formula]

can be used for the planning experiments by the DEAR/SIDDHARTA Collaborations at Frascati [\cite=SIDDHARTA].

Comments on the approach

Kaonic hydrogen revisited

In our recent analysis of the S-wave scattering lengths aK-00  =  (a00  +  a10) / 2 and aK-n0  =  a10 of K-p and K-n scattering, carried out in [\cite=IV8], we have shown that the S-wave scattering lengths aK-00 and aK-n0, calculated to leading order in chiral expansion, satisfy the low-energy theorem

[formula]

We have derived this low-energy theorem relating the S-wave scattering lengths of K-N scattering to the S-wave scattering lengths of π-N scattering.

As has been shown by Weinberg [\cite=SW66], in the chiral limit the S-wave scattering lengths aπ-p0  =  (2  a1 / 20  +  a3 / 20) / 3 and aπ-n0  =  a3 / 20 of π-N elastic scattering  obey the constraint

[formula]

which is caused by Adler's consistency condition [\cite=SA65] . We have shown [\cite=IV8] that due to isospin invariance of strong low-energy interactions in the chiral limit the sum of the S-wave scattering lengths aK-p0  +  aK-n0 is equal to

[formula]

The same result can be obtained by using U-spin invariance of strong low-energy interactions in the chiral limit. According to U-spin classification, the K and π mesons are components of U-spin doublets.

We have found that the Σ(1750) resonance does not saturate the low-energy theorem Eq.([\ref=label34]), therefore we have replaced the contribution of the Σ(1750) resonance by the phenomenological baryon background with quantum numbers of the Σ(1750) resonance [\cite=IV8]. The value of this background we have fixed in terms of the parameter γ Eq.([\ref=label6]) and the contribution of the Λ(1405) resonance.

For the complex S-wave scattering lengths ã00 and ã10 of qN scattering with isospin I  =  0 and I  =  1 we have obtained the numerical values

[formula]

where Re  ã00  =  a00  =  ( -   1.50  ±  0.05)  fm and Re  ã10  =  a10  =  ( +   0.50  ±  0.02)  fm.

It is seen that the real parts of the complex scattering lengths a00 and a10 satisfy the low-energy theorem Eq.([\ref=label34]).

The complex S-wave scattering length ã00 agrees well with the result obtained by Dalitz and Deloff [\cite=RD91]

[formula]

for the position of the pole on sheet II of the E-plane E*  -  i  Γ / 2 with E*  =  1404.9  MeV and Γ  =  53.1  MeV [\cite=RD91]. This corresponds to our choice of the parameters of the Λ(1405) resonance.

It is interesting to notice that the complex S-wave scattering length ã00, calculated in our model, does not contradict the result obtained by Akaishi and Yamazaki [\cite=YA02] at the assumption that the Λ(1405) resonance is the bound K-p state.

For the energy level displacement of the ground state of kaonic hydrogen, calculated for the S-wave amplitude of K-p scattering at threshold Eq.([\ref=label37]), we get

[formula]

This result agrees well with the experimental data by the DEAR Collaboration.

We have shown that the cross sections for elastic K-p scattering and inelastic channels K-p  →  Σ-π+, K-p  →  Σ+π-, K-p  →  Σ0π0 and K-p  →  Λ0π0, calculated in our model for laboratory momenta of the incident K- meson from domain 70  MeV / c  ≤  plab  ≤  150  MeV / c, satisfy the available experimental data within two standard deviations. These results agree well with the theoretical analysis of low-energy qN interactions, carried out in [\cite=WW04] within the SU(3) effective chiral Lagrangian approach and relativistic coupled channels technique.

Kaonic deuterium revisited

Our theoretical predictions for the S-wave amplitude of K-d scattering and the energy level displacement of the ground state of kaonic deuterium, given in [\cite=IV4], are left practically unchanged.
