Electrostatic interface tuning in correlated superconducting heterostructures

Introduction

Interface physics of strongly correlated oxides is a rapidly developing branch of materials science. In heterostructures of ultrathin correlated oxide films, charge and spin states are reconstructed at the interfaces and hence affect the electronic properties of the entire system [\cite=ahn] [\cite=ohtomo]. This interface-controlled behavior provides new opportunities for oxide-film electronics, where a powerful tool for tuning the heterostructure properties is the electric field [\cite=ahn] [\cite=zhao]. In high-temperature superconducting oxides, electric fields can be used to switch between superconducting and insulating states by electrostatically tuning the free carrier density [\cite=mannhart] [\cite=ahn2]. In contrast to chemical doping, where the modifications in the doping level are inevitably related to changes in chemical bonding and microstructure, the field-effect experiments are expected to only modify charge, keeping the microstructure fixed.

In superconducting field-effect transistors (SuFET's), an electric field is applied to a dielectric gate and sweeps charge carriers into a HTSC-film in the drain-source channel. The gate polarization attracts the injected carriers at the gate/film-interface. It thereby creates an accumulation region with a shifted local Tc which, for a nm-thick film, should result in a tuning of the global Tc. With the assumption of a fixed interface microstructure, the field-induced Tc shift should be fully determined by the electric field doping. However, whereas in underdoped HTSC cuprate films the observed Tc shift is about 5-18 K, in the overdoped films Tc is not substantially changed by the field [\cite=mannhart] [\cite=ahn2]. This striking doping dependence is usually explained in terms of a Thomas-Fermi screening length λTF which suggests a stronger exponential decay of accumulated charge inside the overdoped films with higher total carrier density. However, in anisotropic systems, the quantum mechanically determined spread of the charge from the interface is greater and decays slower, in distinction to the classical Thomas-Fermi approach [\cite=ando]. As the cuprate films contain CuO2-planes with an interplanar distance ~  1 nm, only a particular amount of injected charge is accumulated in the first plane at the interface, and the rest is redistributed in the 2-4 nearest planes [\cite=wehrli]. In these multilayers, the charge confinement to the first plane increases for higher total charge densities in the film [\cite=wehrli]. Consequently, in the underdoped cuprate film, despite larger λTF, the low carrier density results in ~  80% of confined charge (mechanisms to achieve stronger confinement have been studied in Ref. [\cite=pavlenko2]). In the overdoped film, about 100% of the injected charge is confined [\cite=wehrli]. As in both cases the calculated field-accumulated charge densities are roughly equal, one should expect similar shifts of Tc both in the under- and overdoped films. This similarity implies that without consideration of the microscopic processes at the gate/film interface, the field doping alone cannot satisfactorily explain the doping dependences of the Tc shift.

In a typical SuFET, the strong modulation of injected carriers requires a gate polarization in the range 10-30μ C/cm2. To achieve this polarization, one uses gates with dielectric constant ε in the range 20-100, fabricated from complex perovskite transition metal oxides like SrTiO3 (STO). Here, extensive studies [\cite=migoni] show that a fundamental property is the hybridization of oxygen (O) p- and transition metal (Ti) d-orbitals caused by the Ti-O-displacements. The Coulomb interaction Vpd of a small amount of injected holes with the hybridized p-d electrons in the insulating gate remains almost unscreened, Vpd  ~  1-2 eV--the spatial distance between the nearest interface unit cells of gate and film is about 2.5-5 Å. Moreover, the holes strongly interact with optical TiO-phonons which polarize the interface. These excitation processes at the interface can possibly lead to charge localization. A further reason for interface charge trapping can be an increased disorder at the cuprate/STO-interface which can lead to Anderson localization. In fact, interface localization is experimentally supported by a hysteresis of the normal state resistance and by the voltage dependence of the hole mobility in HTSC/STO-heterostructures [\cite=mannhart] [\cite=eckstein]. There are also clear experimental indications that in organic field effect transistors, where a similar mechanism of the electric field effect applies, the carrier mobility decreases with increasing ε. [\cite=stassen]

As a step towards an understanding of the cooperative interface phenomena in correlated oxides, we present a theoretical study of field-doped heterostructures, whereby we focus on two key aspects: (i) the interaction of the injected charge carriers with p-d-electrons in the dielectric gate, and (ii) the coupling of carriers to dynamical lattice distortions. We find that these processes at the gate/film interface result in dramatic modifications of the superconducting state with increasing field-induced carrier density.

Microscopic scheme of the electric field effect

To analyze the field dependence of the p-d hybridization at the gate interface, we introduce a model on a 2D-square lattice containing [formula] sites, where each site corresponds to a perovskite unit cell. In each O6-octahedron of the i-th cell we consider a single TiO ionic group with a dynamical covalent bond along the field direction perpendicular to the gate/film-interface (shown in Fig. [\ref=fig1]). In this TiO group, we include only two states (p and d) expressed by the operators d†i(di) and p†i(pi) which obey the one-electron constraint d†idi + p†ipi = 1. In a SuFET, the gate electric field εg affects the p-d-electron transfer:

[formula]

The energy gap Δ0pd is about 3 eV in perovskite dielectric states, but decreases down to 1.5 eV in ferroelectric films due to modifications of surface electronic states [\cite=krcmar]. The electrostatic interaction Epd  =  εgdpd of the gate field with the dipole moment, dpd = erpd, of the electron transfer increases the p-d level splitting and thus tends to localize the TiO-electron. Here e is the electron charge and rpd  ≈  2 Å  is the Ti-O distance. The energy gap Δ0pd in ([\ref=dg1]) refers to εg = 0. In a nonzero electric field, which induces a polarization Pε  ~  εg, the field-dependent TiO-distortions ui  ~  Pε imply Δεpd  =  Δ0pd  +  χεui. The field effect can be taken into account via the expansion of Δεpd in powers of Pε: [formula], which determines the "susceptibility" [formula]. In thin STO films, the high concentration of oxygen vacancies leads to local polar regions and to a quasistatic polarization P0S  ≠  0. [\cite=xi3] The additional, maximal electric field-induced polarization is comparable to P0S and the influence of εg on PS is relatively weak compared to the effect produced by the polar regions. Therefore, for the considered range of εg  <  106 V/cm, we have χεεg  ≪  P0S and consequently we take Δεps  =  Δ0pd in ([\ref=dg1]).

Furthermore, we assume that the barrier for a p-d-transfer (described by the second term in ([\ref=dg1])) is modified by the interface coupling to the carriers in the superconducting film

[formula]

We consider in ([\ref=dg_s]) the coupling with holes, where niσ is the electron number operator with spin σ, and [formula]. The mechanism ([\ref=dg_s]) can lead to a local effective attraction between the injected carriers, which has recently been analyzed for weak-coupling s-wave superconductors [\cite=kopp].

The role of the TiO-distortions is more subtle. As shown in Ref. [\cite=pavlenko], the coupling of the injected charge to a static displacement only shifts the chemical potential in the film. Consequently, we neglect the coupling to static distortions and we focus instead on dynamical TiO-displacements. We are interested in the coupling to the low-energy soft TO1-mode, the polar component of which is hardened up to 50-80 cm- 1 at low T in STO thin films in electric fields [\cite=xi3]. Also, we consider higher-energy polar phonons like the TO2- (170 cm- 1) or the TO4-mode (545 cm- 1). At the gate/film-interface, such TiO-displacements are coupled to the holes in the film

[formula]

where the phonon operators b†i(bi) refer to a particular TiO-mode of energy ωTO, [formula] is the hole-phonon coupling, and Ep is the polaron binding energy.

In the superconducting film, we focus only on the first plane (ideal confinement) without detailed analysis of the interplanar charge redistribution. We treat the film in terms of a 2D-Hubbard model which contains on-site correlations with a nearest and next-nearest tight-binding dispersion [formula]:

[formula]

where [formula] are electron creation operators. We choose the typical values t' / t =  - 0.3 and U = 8t. For the doped Cu 3d band, the effective Hamiltonian ([\ref=hubbard]) describes the motion of hole singlets through the lattice of Cu2 +-ions in CuO2-planes. These spin singlets are formed by the Cu hole and the O hole of the O-plaquette which is hybridized with the d-states of Cu2 + ions. [\cite=zhang]

The combined model ([\ref=dg1])-([\ref=hubbard]) now presents a field-driven two-layer interface system in which the strongly correlated charge carriers in the film are coupled to TiO-excitons and to phonon states of the gate. Fig. [\ref=fig1] shows a possible bonding at a CuO2/STO-interface. Here the oxygen ion is located between Ti4 + and Cu2 + forming a TiO-Cu bond with the shortest distance between Cu (film) and O (STO-gate) as compared to other possible chemical bonding configurations which can appear in HTSC/STO-heterostructures. The coupling ([\ref=dg_s])-([\ref=u_s]) between the Cu holes and TiO-excitations results in a renormalization of the CuO-hybridization amplitude tCuO in the planar CuO-squares and, consequently, in a renormalization of the effective hole hopping parameters t = t2CuO  /  εOp (εOp is the energy of the planar O p-state) and t'. In addition, in the configuration shown in Fig. [\ref=fig1] we also obtain an attractive correction to the one-site repulsion U. To analyze the resulting electronic parameters in the film, we first derive an effective Hubbard model by tracing over phonon and exciton degrees of freedom and subsequently we map this system onto a t-J-model with an effective spin exchange energy Jeff = 4t2eff / Ueff.

Cooperative p-d-exciton & polaron effect

We investigate first the TiO hybridization ([\ref=dg1])-([\ref=dg_s]). To eliminate first order coupling terms in Vpd, we apply the unitary transformation Uexc  =   exp [null] to Hpd + Hexc + Hfilm with syi = i(d†ipi - p†idi), ζpd = VpdΔ0pd / 4(Δ2pd + 2VpdEpd) and [formula]. Averaging the obtained expansion over p-d-exciton states, we find a reduction of the electron hopping parameters t and t' by the factor ξpd  =   cos 2ζpd. For the considered range of Vpd, the attractive corrections ΔUpd to U are small, ΔUpd / U  ~   - 0.2, and result in a maximal increase of Jeff / J  ~  1.07. Consequently, in distinction to weak-coupling superconductors [\cite=kopp], this contribution of the p-d transfer to the increase of Tc is insignificant. In contrast, a pronounced renormalization of Jeff originates from the kinetic term teff = tξpd. For Vpd  /  Δ0pd  ~  1, we find that teff / t can be reduced by ξpd down to ~  0.7. On the other hand, the application of an electric field enhances the exciton factor ξpd  →  1 and hence counteracts polaron localization. This may cause a field-tuned delocalization of holes in the film when we take into account both, p-d-transfer and TiO-phonons.

The electron-phonon coupling in Hpol results in a polaron effect at the gate/film-interface. With the soft phonon mode, the typical values for the interface coupling γ0  ~  0.01-0.1 eV imply large polaronic energies Ep  /  ωTO  ~  0.1-5, where the TiO-mode energy ωTO / t  ~  10- 2-10- 1 (t  ≈  0.25 eV) can be close to the adiabatic limit. To diagonalize ([\ref=u_s]), we apply a variational Lang-Firsov transformation Upol(ui,α,η) [\cite=fehske]. The variational parameter η describes the strength of the polaron effect, ui presents interface static distortions, and α allows for anharmonic excitations. We assume homogeneity in the low-temperature state of the doped film and therefore replaced the site-dependent parameters by their averages: ui = u, [formula]. In the electronic Hamiltonian Hfilm, the hopping energies t and t' are reduced by the polaron band narrowing factor ξpol(η) =  exp [null] where τ  =   exp ( - 4α). The parameters u, η, and τ are determined by minimization of 〈U†pol(Hpol + Hfilm)Upol〉, which is averaged over the phonon vacuum [\cite=fehske] [\cite=roder]. In particular, for η we have the following self-consistent equation:

[formula]

where eK(x)  ≈   - 2(t + t')(1 - x) is obtained from the average kinetic energy in Hfilm, which controls the dependence of η on x. For low x, the contribution of eK to the denominator in ([\ref=gamma]) is significant which results in small η and weak polaron band narrowing ξpol(η). On the other hand, when the hole-phonon coupling is strong and x increases, η approaches 1, which leads to a localization of holes. This signifies that the reduced kinetic energy at sufficient concentration of holes triggers the polaronic localization transition [\cite=roder]. Consequently, the exchange energy Jeff which is controlled by teff = tξpdξpol, is drastically suppressed (Fig. [\ref=fig2]). For the soft TiO-mode (Fig. [\ref=fig2](a)), a suppression of Jeff is obtained for Ep / t > 1 in the relevant range x < 0.3. Coupling instead to the high-energy mode (Fig. [\ref=fig2](b)) increases the minimal values of Ep required for the localization, and therefore the suppression of Jeff is substantially weaker.

Superconductivity in the film

For our considerations it is important that for all widely discussed concepts of high-Tc superconductivity, a suppression of Jeff is feasible due to the loss of the kinetic energy by interface localization. This suppression may in fact result in lower pseudogap temperature T*  ~  Jeff and critical temperature Tc. In order to relate our findings to a distinct model, we approach the superconductivity in the strongly correlated electronic system within a slave-boson approach [\cite=kotliar]. In this scheme spin-carrying fermions fiσ and spinless bosons hi are introduced through ciσ = f†iσhi whereby the constraint [formula] is to be enforced. We consider the pairing [formula], bond [formula] and boson condensation κ  =  〈hi〉2 order parameters. With the mean-field factorization of the t-J Hamiltonian, focusing on the uniform solutions Δij = ( - 1)iy + jyΔd, χij  =  χ, we obtain a free energy, which is to be minimized with respect to Δd, χ, κ. The system of selfconsistent equations for the order parameters has been solved numerically. The pairing amplitude Δd determines the temperature TRVB, whereas the boson temperature TBC has been estimated according to [\cite=kotliar] [\cite=wen] from the kinetic energy of the boson pairs assuming a weak [formula] interplanar coupling in the film. The results are shown in the form of (T, x)-phase diagrams in Fig. [\ref=fig3] for different values of the polaron energy Ep, where Tc corresponds to the lowest temperature among TRVB and TBC. In Fig. [\ref=fig3], the gate field is εg = 0, and the standard phase diagrams are modified essentially due to the interface coupling with the soft mode. Here, at low doping x < 0.12, the superconducting region is limited by TBC, and for larger x by TRVB. The increase of the polaron energy Ep first affects the overdoped region where the right boundary of the superconducting phase is shifted from xm  ≈  0.3 to 0.17 as Ep / t increases to 1.2. With a further increase of Ep, the collaps of TRVB limits the superconducting state also in the underdoped region: the maximally achievable doping, xm, for superconductivity to prevail is xm = 0.1 for Ep / t = 1.3, already below "optimal doping". This is in striking contrast to the classical HTSC-behavior where Tc, after approaching its maximum at optimal doping, smoothly decreases to 0 as x  →  0.3. Finally, with Ep / t > 1.4, the superconducting region disappears due to the suppression of pairing by the soft-mode excitations in the gate. Note that for a film containing more than one superconducting plane, the suppression of pairing is incomplete [\cite=multi].

For the field tuned heterostructures, field-dependent phase diagrams are required. Fig. [\ref=fig4] shows the evolution of such a phase diagram with the increase of the interface polaron energy Ep. The hole doping x(εg) measures the density of holes injected by εg into the film which is initially in the insulating (x0 = 0, Fig. [\ref=fig4](a)) or in the superconducting (x0 = 0.15, Fig. [\ref=fig4](b)) state. Here, [formula] with the charge Q = CV, the dielectric capacitance [formula], the lattice constant a, the thickness of the dielectric film d, and the bias voltage V = εgd. For x0 = 0, the maximally achievable field εg  ≈  106 V/cm for a gate with ε = 100 allows to attain a doping of x  ≈  0.13, which still is in the underdoped range (Fig. [\ref=fig4](a)). The decrease of Jeff for larger Ep leads to the suppression of both TBC and TRVB. These temperatures also remain strongly dependent on εg. In contrast, for x0 = 0.15, when doping x(εg) is raised into the overdoped range, the increase of the polaron energy Ep not merely suppresses TRVB (which limits the superconducting region), but also reduces the slope of TRVB with respect to x(εg). The latter effect results in a decrease of the Tc shift, ΔTc = TRVB(x0  +  Δx(εg)) - TRVB(x0), where the field εg injects the hole density Δx = 0.03 into the film. The corresponding shifts are presented in Fig. [\ref=fig5] and show a strong decrease of ΔTc for Ep / t > 1.2 in the overdoped range, whereas in the underdoped films ΔTc decreases but remains finite. This result supports the surprising fact that the field does not substantially change Tc in the overdoped films.

The hole localization, which is also supported by experiments [\cite=eckstein], presents a serious challenge to current attempts to induce superconductivity in the strongly correlated films. However, a possible recipe how to delocalize the holes follows from the analysis of the coupling between the CuO hole and p-d-TiO exciton. It was noted before that εg increases the exciton factor ξpd and enhances the hole motion for sufficiently large exciton-hole interaction Vpd. To analyze this effect, we investigate the region x0 = 0.13-0.14 close to the transition into the localized state where superconductivity is already suppressed, and then apply the field. Due to the enhancement of teff by ξpd(εg), for x0 = 0.14 we find a reentrant transition (Fig. [\ref=fig6]) into the superconducting state. With the injection of more holes by εg, the kinetic term in ([\ref=gamma]) is reduced which leads to a second suppression of superconductivity at x  ≈  0.17. For Vpd  ≈  Δ0pd, the reentrant superconductivity is stable in a very narrow doping range (see Fig. [\ref=fig6]). For Vpd  >  Δ0pd, this range rapidly extends over the full overdoped regime x  ≤  0.3. Such a strong Vpd, required for the hole delocalization, can be obtained in designed heterostructures with the holes in close proximity to the p-d TiO-orbitals where Cu-states share an apical oxygen with the adjacent Ti as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig1]. Alternatively, we propose to use multilayered cuprates with 3-5 CuO2-planes in a unit cell to delocalize the holes. Due to the small interplanar distance of ~  3.2 Å in some compounds, the polaron-suppressed hopping in the interface plane is in turn enhanced by the interplanar coupling to the subsequent planes.

We found that the cooperative effect of interface hybridization and lattice dynamics in strongly correlated superconducting heterostructures is of crucial importance to their superconducting properties. The interface-caused suppression of Tc for higher doping is a possible explanation of the differences in the electric field effect in overdoped and underdoped SuFETs [\cite=mannhart]. The highly nontrivial behavior of Tc under a variation of the field allows to propose mechanisms for charge delocalization which is a subject of further experimental and theoretical studies.
