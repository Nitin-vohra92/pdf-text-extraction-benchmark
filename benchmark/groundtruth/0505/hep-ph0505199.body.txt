Thermal Time Scales in a Color Glass Condensate

Introduction

There has been considerable recent interest[\cite=Maiani] [\cite=Shuryak:2004] [\cite=Shuryak:2002] [\cite=Soff:2001] [\cite=Teaney:2001] in measurements of a possible quark-gluon plasma whose properties may be probed by relativistic heavy ion collisions (RHIC). Central to the study of a possible unconfined color plasma is the time scale required to form this thermodynamic fluid phase. The central question concerns how the phase formation time compares with the collision time of the heavy ion probes.

The apparent experimentally observed suppression of heavy quark particle production has led to the notion that thermal formation times may be longer than might be at first expected. The notion of an unconfined color fluid plasma was, for some RHIC energies, replaced by the notion of a color glass condensate[\cite=Gtulassy] [\cite=Kharzeev] [\cite=Iancu] [\cite=Jalilian] [\cite=Venugopalan] [\cite=Iancu:02] [\cite=Venugopalan:97] [\cite=Ayala] (CGC). In simple terms, thermal relaxation times in glasses are much longer than thermal relaxation times in fluids. If the thermal relaxation times were not much shorter than the RHIC collision times, then the observed heavy quark suppression becomes understandable.

The thermal relaxation time in condensed matter glasses follows a well known and long established law due to Vogel[\cite=Vogel:1921], Fulcher[\cite=Fulcher:1925] and Tammann[\cite=Tammann:1926] (VFT). The thermal relaxation time depends on temperature according to the VFT rule[\cite=Tanaka:2003]

[formula]

wherein is a thermal activation energy and is a dynamical glass temperature. Our purpose is to point out that the VFT Eq.([\ref=intro1]) is expected to hold true for glass phases obtained from QCD inspired models. The derivation of Eq.([\ref=intro1]) will be given and the method for determining the parameters will thereby be provided.

The notion that the perturbation theory QCD "vacuum" is in reality an excited state at a negative temperature[\cite=pacetti] is introduced in Sec.[\ref=pert]. In terms of the dynamic dielectric response function , the imaginary part is negative for the QCD "vacuum" and positive for QED vacuum. It is the negative temperature feature of the perturbation theory QCD vacuum that allows for the avoidance of Landau ghosts[\cite=Landau:1955] [\cite=siva]. The color screening directly yields a QCD "string potential" between interacting quarks. In Sec.[\ref=strings] we discuss the QCD strings whose tension is empirically described by hadronic Regge trajectories; In Sec.[\ref=Hag], the dynamical glass temperature will be explored via the Hagedorn[\cite=Hagedorn:1965] entropy. We estimate a glass temperature and an activation energy, respectively, of

[formula]

At its inception, the Hagedorn temperature was viewed as the largest possible temperature that could be achieved by smashing hadrons together at very high center of mass energy. Presently, the use of QCD perturbation theory for very high energies implies for short time scales unconfined color, i.e. almost free quarks and gluons.

For high energy RHIC events, the almost free initially produced quarks and gluons constitute a very hot plasma at negative temperature. The plasma cools at first to even more negative temperatures reaching and entering at . In other words, it is the negative inverse temperature (and not ) which passes through zero when you cool a system which starts at negative temperature. Now the plasma further quickly cools from heading towards the Hagedorn temperature from above. But in accordance with VFT glass asymptotic Eq.([\ref=intro1]), the cooling relaxation time grows exponentially ever larger;

[formula]

The collision ends before the temperature can get below the Hagedorn temperature. The glass never fully hardens as discussed in the concluding Sec.[\ref=conc].

Perturbation Theoretical QCD

Recall the running coupling constant in QED, i.e.

[formula]

wherein the dielectric response of the vacuum obeys the dispersion relation

[formula]

For time-like wave vectors, the vacuum is dissipative

[formula]

Among the processes contributing to the dissipative vacuum Eq.([\ref=pert3]) are the creation out of the vacuum of charged particle anti-particle pairs produced by incident electromagnetic radiation. From Eqs.([\ref=pert2]) and ([\ref=pert3]), it follows that for some space-like , the real dielectric response will vanish. This constitutes the Landau ghost problem of QED. In particlular, the potential energy between two static charges, and is determined by the dielectric screening function as discussed in standard works on quantum electrodynamics[\cite=Berestetskii:1997];

[formula]

Note that .

For the QCD case, the running coupling constant

[formula]

To one loop order in perturbation theory, one finds

[formula]

wherein is the number of colors and is the number of flavors.

Note the condition

[formula]

which implies that the perturbation theory vacuum is in reality an excited QCD state which decays into the true vacuum[\cite=pacetti]. Unlike the perturbation theory QED vacuum which requires external radiation energy to produce particle pairs, the perturbation theory QCD vacuum spontaneously decays into the true vacuum radiating bursts of hadrons. The excited state QCD perturbation theory vacuum is similar to an excited amplifying LASER material with inverted excitation energy levels. The Laser material spontaneously decays into the true ground state radiating a photon pulse. Amplifying media may be described by a negative temperature. Initial high energy particles blast the true vacuum into a QCD perturbation theory vacuum at negative temperature. The resulting system then cools to the true vacuum radiating hadrons. When a very hot negative temperature cools down the temperature keeps going down. The temperature goes down through then appearing at further cooling through decreasing positive temperatures. From Eqs.([\ref=pert6]) and ([\ref=pertt8]) it follows for space-like wave vectors that so there are no QCD Landau ghosts.

The quark potentials are described in terms of the color screening function

where the color matrices for the two quarks are and Taking two derivatives of Eq.([\ref=pert9]) with respect to yields

[formula]

From the small wave number dependence of the color dielectric response,

[formula]

one finds via Eqs.([\ref=pert10]) and ([\ref=pert11]) that

[formula]

The central result of this section is a confining linear potential

[formula]

with a "string tension"

[formula]

Let us now consider in more detail the nature of the QCD string.

QCD Strings

The QCD string may be physically pictured as follows[\cite=yogi]: (i) Between two quarks with color charges and is a string. (ii) Inside the string is a gluon condensate electric field

[formula]

(iii) The tension in the string is

[formula]

(iv) Let us suppose two virtually zero mass quarks move with light speed on the ends of a linear string which extends along the straight line segment . In rigid body rotation

[formula]

The quantum relationship between angular momentum and mass is taken to be

[formula]

From experimental linear Regge trajectories

[formula]

The question arises as to the nature of quark-anti quark pair creation, i.e. jet production, in a scattering experiment wherein the incoming particles supply the energy to create the gluon condensate within the string as well as supplying the quark pair energy ( per quark). Quark motion along the string obeys Newton's law for the rate of change of momentum

[formula]

The quark energy-momentum relation in a 1+1 dimensional QCD string follows from the partitioned Hamiltonian matrix

[formula]

where (from the quark-pair creation viewpoint) the transition rate per unit time to create a quark is determined by Fermi's golden rule

[formula]

From the viewpoint of QCD string fragmentation, the probability that the string dissociates may be written

[formula]

where Eq.([\ref=strings8]) has been invoked. The transition rate per unit time per unit string length for fragmentation follows from Eqs.([\ref=strings10]) and ([\ref=strings11]); It is

[formula]

From the above results, it appears that strings connecting high mass quarks are less likely to fragment than strings connecting low mass quarks. The QCD system starts out very hot so that critical glass temperatures are approached from above. It is here that the notion of a string glassy state appears most useful.

Hagedorn Glass Temperature

We have shown in Eq.([\ref=strings3]) for a classical QCD string model that the energy and angular momentum are related by

[formula]

In the quantum theory of the Boson (gluon) string, has the spectrum

[formula]

If there are string excitations with polarization each carrying angular momentum with , then

[formula]

Eq.([\ref=hag3]) gives rise to a statistical mechanical entropy problem which involves analytical number theory. How many different ways can you form the integer out of the smaller integers ? From the asymptotic solution[\cite=Hardy:1918] of an earlier and similar partitioning problem, the solution to the QCD excitation string partitioning problem was found[\cite=Huang:1970]. In the large limit,

[formula]

From the general definition of degeneracy and entropy,

[formula]

along with Eqs.([\ref=hag1]), ([\ref=hag2]) and ([\ref=hag4]) we find the Hagedorn string entropy

[formula]

The Hagedorn glass temperature is

[formula]

where Eq.([\ref=strings5]) has been invoked. The thermal equations of state for a hot string now follow from

[formula]

Thus, the entropy as a function of temperature reads,

[formula]

The role of the entropy in determining transition rates follows from the rule of averaging over initial states and summing over final states. Since the ratio of the number of final states to the number of initial states is given by

[formula]

the transition rates may be phase space dominated by the exponential entropy factors. In particular, the thermal relaxation times for very hot color unconfined states is related to the thermal relation times for finite temperature unconfined states via

[formula]

Eq.([\ref=hag11]) is consistent with the VFT asymptotic Eq.([\ref=intro1]) with

[formula]

Eq.([\ref=hag11]) is the central result of this work.

Conclusion

Perturbative QCD, presumed valid at high energies or for very short times, contains free quarks and gluons as manifested through jets and leads naturally towards the possibilty of a quark-gluon plasma phase in high energy heavy ion collisions(RHIC). Our analysis of quark-gluon plasma formation in heavy ion collisions devolves around the fact that the perturbative QCD vacuum is unstable. We have shown that in reality it is an excited state at a negative temperature. The negative temperature feature of the perturbative QCD vacuum is responsible for the avoidance of the Landau ghost in QCD [\cite=pacetti] [\cite=siva].

On the other hand, certain results from RHIC experiments regarding heavy flavor production and jets led to the conjecture that the thermal quark-gluon plasma formation times may be longer than the collision times and hence to the notion of a new state of matter: a color glass condensate. For a glassy state, thermal relaxation times are long and a collision ends before the glass fully hardens. We have demonstrated here that in the hadronic QCD string model the unconfined quark-gluon plasma is indeed condensed into glass. Our computation of the thermal relaxation times for unconfined color states invokes the fact that the hot plasma begins at a negative temperature (as for a laser). We have derived the VFT cooling law for glass for unconfined quark-gluon plasma with a glass transition temperature estimated to be and an activation energy of . We have interpreted the glass transition temperature as the Hagedorn temperature (approached from above) at which collisions cease as a result of rapidly growing thermal relaxation times. It appears quite satisfactory that asymptotic freedom from perturbative QCD in concert with a hadronic string with its condensed color electric fields and a highly degenerate Regge spectrum, suffices to produce the VFT cooling law. It lends strong support to the existence of a color glass state of matter.
