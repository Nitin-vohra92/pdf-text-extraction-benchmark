Introduction

It is well known from the quarkonium phenomenology that the best fit for meson spectroscopy is found for a mixture of vector and scalar potentials put by hand in the equations (see, e.g., [\cite=luc]). The same can be said about the treatment of nuclear phenomena describing the influence of the nuclear medium on the nucleons [\cite=ser]. Besides avoiding Klein's paradox, the spin-orbit splitting is suppressed in hadrons and enhanced in nuclei due to presence of a scalar potential. The mixed vector-scalar potential has also been analyzed in 1+1 dimensions for a linear potential [\cite=cas2], as well as for a general potential which goes to infinity as |x|  →    ∞   [\cite=ntd]. In both of those last references it has been concluded that there is confinement if the scalar coupling is of sufficient intensity compared with the vector coupling. The problem of a fermion in the background of an inversely linear potential by considering a proper mixing of vector and scalar Lorentz structures was re-examined [\cite=asc7]. The problem was mapped into an exactly solvable Sturm-Liouville problem of a Schrödinger-like equation with an effective Kratzer potential. The case of a pure scalar potential, already analyzed in [\cite=asc6], was obtained as a particular case.

Motivated by the success found in references [\cite=asc7] and [\cite=asc6] the case of massive fermions interacting with background potentials of vector and scalar natures with a modified Pöschl-Teller-like [\cite=flugge] configuration is examined here.  Just a fifty-fifty vector-scalar mixing is considered in order to make one of the components of the Dirac spinor to obey a Schrödinger equation with an effective modified Pöschl-Teller-like potential. The circumstances one can have bound states for this problem are analyzed and bound-state solutions are obtained. The behaviour of the eigenenergies as a function of he parameters of the potential is also taken into account. The impossibility of pair creation by the vector potential due to the presence of the scalar potential and its coupling to the fermion mass is remarked. The problem of massive fermions interacting with delta-like vector and scalar potentials is also discussed as a limit of the previous problem. Another problem that has also found many applications in the study of meson physics is that of fermions interacting with potentials of scalar and pseudoscalar natures, particularly in the context of the fractionization of the baryon number in the vacuum due to the topological configurations of the classical backgrounds [\cite=jac]. In this regard it is shown that the problem of massive fermions interacting with vector and scalar potentials of Pöschl-Teller type can be mapped into the problem of massless fermions interacting with topological scalar and pseudoscalar backgrounds, which also admits bound-state solutions. The fermion bound state for a kink-like pseudoscalar is obtained explicitly and compared with a similar problem reported previously in the literature [\cite=wilcz].

The Dirac equation with mixed vector-scalar potentials in a 1+1 dimension

In the presence of time-independent vector and scalar potentials the 1+1 dimensional time-independent Dirac equation for a fermion of rest mass m reads

[formula]

where E is the energy of the fermion, c is the velocity of light and p is the momentum operator. α and β are Hermitian square matrices satisfying the relations α2  =  β2 = 1 and [formula]. The positive definite function [formula], satisfying a continuity equation, is interpreted as a position probability density and its norm is a constant of motion. This interpretation is completely satisfactory for single-particle states [\cite=tha]. We use α  =  σ1 and β  =  σ3. The subscripts for the terms of potential denote their properties under a Lorentz transformation: v for the time component of the two-vector potential and s for the scalar potential. Provided that the spinor is written in terms of the upper and the lower components, ψ+ and ψ- respectively, the Dirac equation decomposes into:

[formula]

where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to x. In terms of ψ+ and ψ- the spinor is normalized as [formula], so that ψ+ and ψ- are square integrable functions. It is clear from the pair of coupled first-order differential eqs. ([\ref=1c]) that both ψ+ and ψ- have opposite parities if the Dirac equation is covariant under x  →   - x.

For Vv = 0 and a pure scalar attractive potential, one finds energy levels for fermions and antifermions arranged symmetrically about E = 0 [\cite=cn]. The presence of  a vector potential breaks this symmetry. For Vv  =   - Vs and an attractive scalar potential, the vector potential is repulsive for fermions but attractive for antifermions. Hence, it can be anticipated that there is no bound-state solutions for fermions, but only for antifermions. Vv  =   + Vs is the other way around, i.e., the mixing only holds bound states for fermions. Next this last circumstance is taken into account.

The Pöschl-Teller-like potential

Here the particular case Vv = Vs is considered. The solutions concerning to Vv =  - Vs can be obtained from the previous one by applying the charge conjugation operation to the set of eqs. ([\ref=1c]), namely, [formula], E  →   - E, Vv  →   - Vv and Vs  →  Vs. For Vv = Vs the lower component is obtained from the knowledge of the upper component through the equation

[formula]

whereas one gets a Sturm-Liouville problem for the upper component

[formula]

In this way the Dirac problem can be solved by resorting to the solution of a Schrödinger-like problem. Note that eqs. ([\ref=psi-]) and ([\ref=sch]) are valid only for states with E  ≠   - mc2. An inspection of the first order eqs. ([\ref=1c]) reveals that it is impossible to have normalizable wave functions corresponding to E =  - mc2. Equation ([\ref=sch]) is a Schrödinger equation with an effective potential Veff = (E + mc2)Vs / (mc2) and an effective energy given by Eeff = (E2 - m2c4) / (2mc2).

For a scalar potential like the symmetric modified Pöschl-Teller [\cite=flugge] one has

[formula]

From eq. ([\ref=sch]) it can be noted that the effective energy for bound states has to be greater than the minimum value of the effective potential and less than zero, since Vs  →  0 for x  →    ±    ∞  , that is

[formula]

The states with |E| > mc2 corresponds to the continuous spectrum and the bound states are to be found in the range - mc2 < E <  + mc2, for V0  ≥  mc2. For V0 < mc2 the bound-state energies are in the interval - 2V0 + mc2 < E <  + mc2, and there is an energy gap between - mc2 and mc2 - 2V0.

The solution of the relativistic problem can be obtained from a comparison with the nonrelativistic solution of the symmetric modified Pöschl-Teller problem treated, for example, in references [\cite=flugge], [\cite=lan] and [\cite=nieto]. The eigenenergies obey the equation

[formula]

where n is a natural number, an = s - n > 0, and

[formula]

Note that E >  - mc2 for ensuring that s > 0.

In Fig.1 it is shown the behaviour of the three lowest states as a function of V0 for α = 1. For some values of V0 it is possible to have fermion states with negative energy, although they never cross the value E =  - mc2, as expected. The bound states are found to the right of the slanted dashed line (this one is expressed by - 2V0 + mc2) and the energy gap is the vertical distance between E =  - mc2 and the slated dashed line. It can also be seen from this figure that as V0 increases the number of allowed bound states increases.

The behaviour the eigenenergies as a function of α for a fixed value of V0 (V0 < mc2) has also been analyzed. All the bound-states energies emerges from the minimum allowed value E =  - 2V0 + mc2. As α increases the number of allowed bound states decreases, because the highest level states are ejected from the discrete spectra to the continuum. That can not be interpreted as a pair production mechanism, since the fermion bound state becomes a fermion scattering state. The lowest bound state, n = 0, is always present and reaches asymptotically the continuum as α  →    ∞  .

Following the reference [\cite=nieto] one finds that the upper component of the Dirac spinor can be written in terms of the Gegenbauer (ultraspherical) polynomial [formula] (a polynomial of degree n),

[formula]

where N is a normalization constant. The lower component is obtained from eq. ([\ref=psi-]). By using differential and recurrence relations among the Gegenbauer polynomials [\cite=abr], one obtains

[formula]

It is worthwhile to note that by defining [formula], where g > 0, one has that Vs, defined in eq. ([\ref=Vs]), behaves like a delta potential as |α|  →    ∞  , that is

[formula]

This way the behaviour of a relativistic fermion in the presence of mixed vector-scalar delta potentials can be studied. In the limit |α|  →    ∞   the parameter s defined in ([\ref=s]) can be approximated for

[formula]

and the requirement γ - n > 0 for having bound states is only satisfied for the lowest state (n = 0), with eigenenergy satisfying the equation [formula]. Under such conditions the delta potential has only one bound state with energy E = mc2(1 - g2) / (1 + g2), which agrees with reference [\cite=adame]. The upper component of the eigenspinor is given by

[formula]

and the lower component is obtained by using ([\ref=psi-]), namely

[formula]

The normalization constant is given by [formula]. Although the lower component of the eigenspinor is discontinuous at the origin, the probability density is continuous there. Furthermore, the nonrelativistic limit can be recovered by taking the strength of the potential g very small, such that the lower component is suppressed and the energy is given by E = mc2(1 - 2g2), in consonance with the results found in reference [\cite=diaz].

The problem of scalar and pseudoscalar potentials

The problem of fermions in two-dimensions interacting with classical background potentials has also been considered in quantum field theory to describe some properties of quasi-one dimensional conductors and some polymers. One of such an interesting properties is the possibility of induced fractional fermion number in the vacuum due to interactions of fermions with topological backgrounds. To illustrate this last phenomenon, one usually resorts to models of fermions interacting with background potentials of scalar and/or pseudoscalar natures [\cite=jac]. For fermions interacting with scalar and pseudoscalar potentials, approximate methods allow one to obtain the fractionization of the fermion number, such as in the model considered in [\cite=wilcz], where the fermion is massless and the scalar, φs, and pseudoscalar, φp, potentials obey the constraint φ2s  +  φ2p = M2c4, where M is a constant.

A very similar model of massless fermions interacting with scalar and pseudoscalar potentials can be obtained from this one considered here. In fact, if one performs a unitary transformation (local chiral rotation) in eq. ([\ref=1a]) H̃ = UHU- 1 and ψ̃ = Uψ, with [formula] and [formula], the transformed Hamiltonian describes a massless fermion interacting with a scalar φs and a pseudoscalar φp potential

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula]. One can note that [formula], which recovers the constraint of the linear sigma model, with M2 = m2, as x  →    ±    ∞   for [formula]. One can observe a kink-like profile for the pseudoscalar field and could use this model to study the fermion fractionization in the context of quantum field theory. It is a model which exhibits a trapping of massless neutral fermions by scalar and pseudoscalar potentials, whose localized states can be obtained by applying the local unitary transformation to the localized states obtained in the previous section.

In the section II of the reference [\cite=wilcz] the model used to illustrate the fermion number fractionization via adiabatic approximation, consists of a pseudoscalar potential, which simulates an infinitely thin soliton and a uniform scalar potential, which plays the rôle of the fermion rest mass. From the case Vv =  - δ(x), the bound-state solutions for those configurations of the scalar and pseudoscalar potentials can be recovered. In this case one has

[formula]

where k is an constant of integration and Θ(x) is the Heaviside step function. With the choice k =  - g + π the eigenspinor is given by

[formula]

which is clearly discontinuous at the origin, although the probability density is well defined everywhere. Nevertheless, a continuous wave function at the origin can be obtained by setting tan (g / 2) = 1 / g, namely

[formula]

with energy given by E =  - mc2 cos (g). If one had used the same representation for the gamma matrices of the reference [\cite=wilcz], the present solution would coincide with that one found previously, except for the fact that the pseudoscalar potential in the present case is negative as well as is the energy for g > 0, while in Ref. [\cite=wilcz] the converse is true.

Conclusions

We have succeed in searching for exact Dirac bound solutions for massive fermions by considering a proper mixing of vector-scalar modified Pöschl-Teller-like potentials in 1+1 dimensions. The satisfactory completion of this task has been possible by means of the methodology of effective potentials which has transmuted the question into the one of a Schrödinger-like equation with an effective symmetric modified Pöschl-Teller potential. We note that the energy levels for particles, emerging from E = mc2, can have negative values but they never dive into the Dirac sea (E =  - mc2), despite the presence of an electric field. Such a behaviour can be interpreted as an increase of the effective energy threshold to have pair production, due to the scalar field which couples to the mass of the fermion.

Recently we have reported on the trapping of neutral fermions by a kink-like pseudoscalar potential [\cite=cashott2]. In this paper it has also been shown how a model of charged and massive fermions interacting with a convenient mixing of vector and scalar potentials can be mapped into the one of a massless neutral fermion interacting with a proper mixing of scalar-pseudoscalar backgrounds, where the pseudoscalar potential has also a kink-like profile and the scalar potential a lump-like profile. As a consequence of the mapping, the bound states of this last problem can also be obtained from the previous one.

From the point of view of second quantization the problem of fermions under the action of scalar and pseudoscalar backgrounds illustrates the phenomenon of the fermion number fractionization which plays a very important rôle in low-dimensional systems as well as in particle physics [\cite=nie], although that analysis was not carried out here. For that we need to know the scattering states in the presence of the scalar and pseudoscalar potentials. Nevertheless, we recover the bound-state when the pseudoscalar potential exhibits an infinitely thin solitonic profile. A problem that was treated in the reference [\cite=wilcz] and for which the scattering states can be easily found.
