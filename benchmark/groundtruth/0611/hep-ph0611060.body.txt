I. Introduction

The top quark has an exceptionally large mass of the order of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale and is naturally expected to have a close connection to new physics [\cite=1a] [\cite=1b]. The most popular model of new physics is the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM). In this model, a discrete multiplicative symmetry of R-parity, defined by  = ( - 1)2S + 3B + L, with spin S, baryon number B and lepton number L, is often imposed on the Lagrangian to maintain the separate conservation of B and L. However this conservation requirement is not dictated by any fundamental principle such as gauge invariance or renormalizability. The finiteness of the neutrino mass as suggested by the Super-Kamiokande and several other neutrino experiments also implies that lepton numbers may be violated. So it is of great interest to consider possible violation of this symmetry and study its experimental consequences in collider experiments.

The most general superpotential of the MSSM consistent with the SU(3)  ×  SU(2)  ×  U(1) symmetry and supersymmetry contains R-violating interactions which are given by [\cite=5]

[formula]

Here Li(Qi) and Ei(Ui,Di) are the left-handed lepton (quark) doublet and right-handed lepton (quark) singlet chiral superfields, and [formula] denotes charge conjugation. H1,2 are the Higgs chiral superfields. The indices [formula], [formula], [formula] denote generations and α, β and γ are the color indices. We focus our attention only on the tri-linear supersymmetric R-parity violating interactions in Eq. (1) and assume that the bi-linear terms μiLiH2 can be rotated away by a field redefinition [\cite=6]. The λ and λ' are the coupling constants of the [formula]-violating interactions and λ'' those of the [formula]-violating interactions. The non-observation of the proton decay imposes very strong constraints on the products of the [formula]-violating and [formula]-violating couplings [\cite=7]. It is thus conventionally assumed in phenomenological studies that only one type of these interactions (either [formula]- or [formula]-violating) exists. Constraints on these [formula]-parity violating couplings have been obtained from various low-energy process and it is notable that the bounds on the couplings involving top quark are generally quite weak (see [\cite=25] for a review). In the future precision top quark experiments, these couplings may either manifest themselves or subject to further constraints.

The R-parity violating interactions can have rich phenomenology in top quark physics: they can have sizable effects in top quark decays and productions at colliders. For example, the R-violating couplings can greatly enhance the FCNC top quark decays [\cite=22] and can induce new mechanisms for the productions of single top [\cite=21] and top pair at hadronic colliders [\cite=29]. At a linear collider, the R-violating couplings can contribute to the top pair production via tree-level u-channel squark exchange diagrams. In [\cite=18] the author has investigated such contributions to the production rate for unpolarized beams. Considering that the future linear collider will likely have polarized beams, we extend the study to the case of polarized beams. By comparing the polarized beams with the unpolarized beams, we find that the polarized beams are more powerful in probing such R-violating interactions. Also, we will study the effects of these R-violating couplings in top quark polarization as well as the forward-backward asymmetry at a linear collider.

This article is arranged as follows. In Sec. II we will calculate the effects of the R-violating couplings in top pair production at a linear collider. In Sec. III we will present the numerical results and give some discussions. And finally in Sec. IV we give the conclusion.

II. Calculations

In terms of four-component Dirac spinors, the second term in Eq.(1), λ'ijkδαβLiQjαDckβ, leads to the following inetractions

[formula]

Apart from the s-channel diagrams mediated by γ or Z, the top pair production can also proceed through the diagram mediated by the squark shown in Fig.1 due to such lepton-number violating interactions. Looking at the lagrangians, one can easily find that in R-parity violating inetractions, one vertex is proportional to L and the other is proportional to R ([formula])). The expressions of the amplitudes, together with the SM contributions [\cite=18], are given by

[formula]

Here MSM stands for the two SM s-channel diagrams mediated by γ and Z for unpolarized beams. For the photon-exchange diagram, [formula] and V  =  ΓV = 0. For the Z-exchange diagram, [formula]. M'SM is same as MSM, but for left-handed electron beam. Mλ' is for squark-mediated diagram. The Mandelstum variables are defined as s = (p1 + p2)2, t = (p1 - p3)2 and u = (p1 - p4)2. The amplitude for squark-mediated diagram is proportional to |λ'|2.

Note that the R-parity violating couplings involved in our calculations are λ'13k with k = 1,2,3 being the generation index. We will consider only one such coupling at a time. From [\cite=25] we know that the coupling λ'132 is the most weakly constrained one. So we will use this coupling in the following analyses. This implies that the exchanged squark in Fig.1(b) is the supersymmetric partner of s-quark.

III. Numerical results and discussions

In this section we present some numerical results. In our calculations we only consider the tree-level diagrams, and for the R-violating contributions we only consider its interference with the corresponding SM diagrams and neglect the higher order contributions. The current constraints on λ'132 scales linearly with [formula] mass, which is smaller than 0.28 for [formula] GeV [\cite=25]. To be conservative we will take λ'132 = 0.1 for illustration. For other parameters involved, we take mt = 175 GeV, mZ = 91 GeV, α = 1 / 128 and sin 2θw = 0.23. Note that around the center-of-mass energy of 350 GeV (  ~  2mt), the threshold effects are very important [\cite=27]. In our calculations we avoid this by considering a center-of-mass energy above the [formula] threshold. In Fig. 2 we plotted the cross section of top pair production versus the center-of-mass energy in various cases. For the purpose of illustration, we present the cross section with squark mass of 300 GeV, which is well above the bounds given by CDF and D0 [\cite=28]. In Fig.2(a) the curves are for the predictions in the SM and R-violating SUSY with unpolarized beams and the left-handed polarized e- beam, respectively. In Fig.2(b), we used the left-handed polarized e- beams and showed the cross section of t with definite helicity of the top quark, where t+ (t-) stands for a top quark with positive (negative) helicity. It is clear from Fig.2(a) that the left-handed polarized e- beams lead to significant enhancement for the production cross section. From both figures we can see that the presence of lepton number violating interactions can increase the cross section by over 10 percent.

Now we consider the dependence of the cross section on squark mass. For this purpose, we fix the center-of-mass energy at 500 GeV. In Fig.3(a) we plot the cross-section versus the squark mass. As the squark mass increases, the cross-sections converge to their corresponding SM values, indicating the decoupling nature of the squark interactions. In Fig.3(b), we plot the cross section versus the coupling constant λ'. We can see that as λ' increases, the cross sections become larger than their corresponding SM values since the cross section is proportional to |λ'|2.

In addition to the production rate, we also present the effects of the R-violating couplings on the top polarization defined by

[formula]

where - (+) indicates the cross section of t with negative (positive) helicity of the top quark. The hemisphere top polarizations are obtained by restricting the top scattering angle in the [formula] c.m. frame to the forward or backward hemisphere. The forward top polarization is then defined as

[formula]

and the backward top polarization Bt is similarly defined with cos θ < 0. Here θ is the top scattering angle in the t c.m. frame.

Also, we will study the effects on the forward-backward asymmetry of the top quark [\cite=29]

[formula]

which can be defined for either a fixed top quark helicity or with the helicities summed, and θ is the top scattering angle in the t c.m. frame. In Fig.4(a), we plot the polarization versus the intermediate squark mass. We see that as the squark mass increases, the polarizations approach to their corresponding SM values. In Fig.4(b) we show the polarization versus the R-violating coupling. As the R-violating coupling increases, the polarizations become more deviate from their SM values.

Fig.5(a,b) are the plots of forward-backward asymmetries versus the center-of-mass energy and the squark mass. It is imperative to mention that in Fig.5(a) we plotted the variation of the absolute value of AFB with the center-of-mass energy. It is clear that the absolute value of forward-backward asymmetries increase with the center-of-mass energy.

The 2σ statistical limit for λ'13k versus squark mass is shown in Fig.6 for the integrated luminosity of 100 fb- 1 with unpolarized and with left-handed polarized e- beams. We see that the linear collider can be quite powerful in constraining these R-violating couplings in case of unobservation and the polarized beams are more powerful in probing such R-violating couplings.

IV. Conclusion

We studied the effects of the R-parity violating interactions in top pair production at a linear collider. We found that in the allowed range of these R-violating couplings, the top pair production rate as well as the top quark polarization and the forward-backward asymmetry can be significantly altered. By comparing the unpolarized beams with the polarized beams, we found that the polarized beams are more powerful in probing such new physics.
