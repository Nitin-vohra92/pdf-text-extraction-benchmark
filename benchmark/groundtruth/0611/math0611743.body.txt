An Inequality for Basic Confluent Hypergeometric Series

Introduction

In the studies of Plancherel-Rotach type asymptotics of q-orthogonal polynomials such as Ismail-Masson [formula], Stieltjes-Wigert [formula] and q-Laguerre [formula][\cite=Ismail1] [\cite=Ismail6] [\cite=Ismail7], the Ramanujan function Aq(z), which is also called q-Airy function in the literature, plays a very important role. It is called q-Airy function because it appears repeatedly in the Plancherel-Rotach type asymptotics of q-orthogonal polynomials, just like classical Airy function in the classical Plancherel-Rotach asymptotics of classical orthogonal polynomials[\cite=Ismail2] [\cite=Szego]. In [\cite=Zhang], we have investigated certain properties of the Ramanujan function Aq(z). It turns out that, the polynomials like Ismail-Masson [formula], Stieltjes-Wigert [formula], q-Laguerre [formula] and the Ramanujan function Aq(z), they are all in a particular class of entire functions including all the confluent basic hypergeometric series. In this short note will show that this class of entire functions satisfy an inequality similar to the inequality for the Ramanujan function Aq(z) in [\cite=Zhang]. Finally, we will state an inequality for a class of meromorphic functions including Θ(z|q) defined as in [\cite=Ismail6] [\cite=Ismail7]. Θ(z|q) also appears in the main terms of the Plancherel-Rotach type asymptotics when a scaling parameter is irrational.

As in papers[\cite=Ismail6] [\cite=Ismail7] [\cite=Zhang], we will follow the usual notations from q-series [\cite=Andrews] [\cite=Gasper] [\cite=Ismail2]

[formula]

Moreover, we shall use the multishifted factorials [\cite=Andrews] [\cite=Gasper] [\cite=Ismail2]

[formula]

Thoughout this paper, we shall always assume that 0 < q < 1, hence n =   ∞   is allowed in the above definitions.

A confluent basic hypergeometric series is formally defined as [\cite=Andrews] [\cite=Gasper] [\cite=Ismail2]

[formula]

with s + 1 - r > 0 .

We will use a simple summation formula

[formula]

which is a special case of the q-binomial theorem [\cite=Andrews] [\cite=Gasper] [\cite=Ismail2],

[formula]

The Ramanujan function Aq(z) is defined as[\cite=Ismail2]

[formula]

In [\cite=Zhang] we proved that

[formula]

for any nonzero complex number z and

[formula]

for any complex number z.

The theta function Θ(z|q) is defined as

[formula]

for 0 < q < 1 and all nonzero complex number z.

The Inequality

Let

[formula]

with the parameters satisfying

[formula]

It is clear that the function

[formula]

is of the form [\eqref=eq:2.1] with

[formula]

Assume

[formula]

then,

[formula]

We rewrite [\eqref=eq:2.6] as

[formula]

For k = 0,1,..., the terms

[formula]

are bounded by

[formula]

thus,

[formula]

or

[formula]

[formula]

Assume that the entire function f(z) is defined as in [\eqref=eq:2.1] and [\eqref=eq:2.2], then,

[formula]

for any nonzero complex number z. In particular, for

[formula]

we have for any nonzero complex number.

The same proof could be employed to show the following results.

Let f(z) be a meromorphic function with the following Laurent expansion

[formula]

on the whole complex plane except at z = a. If there exist two positive numbers α > 0 and 0 < q < 1 such that

[formula]

then

[formula]

for z  ≠  a, where

[formula]

and

[formula]

In the particular, the theta function Θ(z|q) has an upper bound

[formula]

for any 0 < α < 1, where

[formula]

Clearly, we have

[formula]

For [formula] and z  ≠  a, then, all the terms

[formula]

are bounded by

[formula]

and the inequality [\eqref=eq:2.24] follows.
