3D Radiative Transfer Modeling of Clumpy Dust Tori Around AGN

Introduction

The presence of an optically thick dust torus is the cornerstone of unification schemes for AGN to explain the orientation-dependent difference between type 1 and type 2 objects. The dust inside the torus absorbes the AGN radiation and reemits it in the infrared. For the nucleus of NGC 1068, interferometric observations directly resolved the torus in the NIR and MIR [\citep=Wei04] [\citep=Jaf04]. The interferometric data support the idea that the dust within the torus is concentrated in clumps instead of homogeneously distributed [\citep=Wit04] [\citep=Jaf04].

Clumpy torus model and its application to NGC 1068

Recently, we presented our new 3-dimensional radiative transfer calculations of clumpy dust tori [\citep=Hon06]. The torus modeling makes use of a database of dust cloud SEDs simulated with our Monte Carlo radiative transfer code. For each set of model parameters, we simulate torus SEDs for different random arrangement of clouds. Our torus model was applied to the Seyfert 2 AGN NGC 1068 [\citep=Hon06]. Here, we present new results with some improvement to the earlier publication. We simultaneously modeled NIR and MIR photometry as well as NIR and MIR interferometric data of the nucleus. In Fig. [\ref=N1068SED] we show a comparison between the observed high-resolution SED and our model SED. Important model parameters are the AGN luminosity [formula], torus inclination i = 70 deg , and optical depth of the torus τTorus(λ = 10  μm)  ~  1.

Why do we need clumpiness in the torus? [\citet=Kro88] theoretically argue that homogeneously distributed dust cannot survive in the environment of an AGN. This has been supported by MIR spectro-interferometric observations of NGC 1068 which find deeper silicate features with growing baseline [\citep=Jaf04]. This is apparently inconsistent with homogeneously distributed dust [\citep=Sch05]. In addition, NIR long-baseline interferometry of NGC 1068 finds a surprisingly high visibility at a baseline of 46 m which cannot be explained by a simple homogeneous model [\citep=Wit04]. In Figs. [\ref=N1068SED] & [\ref=N1068MI], we show that our clumpy torus model is able to reproduce the interferometric results.
