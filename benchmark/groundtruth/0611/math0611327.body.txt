A Characterization of right coideals of quotient type and its application to classification of Poisson boundaries

Introduction

Since Woronowicz introduced the axiomatic compact quantum groups [\cite=Wor3], they have attracted a growing interest of many researchers as a framework to describe new types of symmetries. In this paper, we study two typical examples of ergodic actions of compact quantum groups, namely right coideals and Poisson boundaries.

Let [formula] be a compact quantum group. A right coideal is a von Neumann subalgebra of the function algebra on [formula] which is globally invariant under the right translation action of [formula]. Taking the fixed point algebra of a left action of a quantum subgroup gives an example of a right coideal. We say that such a right coideal is of quotient type. When [formula] is an ordinary group, it is well-known that all the right coideals are of quotient type. However, when [formula] is a quantum group, not all the right coideals are realized as quotients [\cite=Po1], [\cite=Po2], [\cite=To2]. This fact presents a contrast between the quantum groups and the ordinary ones.

Another difference occurs in behaviors of infinite tensor product actions. In the ordinary case, such an action is minimal and, in particular, the relative commutant of the fixed point algebra is trivial. However, this is not the case for quantum groups. In [\cite=I1], Izumi has described this contrast by introducing the notion of a Poisson boundary of a dual discrete quantum group. More precisely, he has shown that the Poisson boundary is isomorphic to the relative commutant of the fixed point algebra. Moreover he has also studied the Poisson boundary of the dual of SUq(2) and shown a striking result that the Poisson boundary is isomorphic to the standard Podle sphere [formula] introduced in [\cite=Po1], [\cite=Po2]. On one hand, this result has led to a conjecture that the Poisson boundary is isomorphic to the quantum flag manifold for any q-deformed classical compact Lie group. For SUq(N), the conjecture was confirmed affirmatively in [\cite=INT]. Note that a q-deformed classical compact Lie group is co-amenable, that is, the dual discrete quantum group is amenable in the sense of [\cite=BeMuTu1]. On the other hand for non-amenable cases, the Poisson and Martin boundaries [\cite=NT] of universal orthogonal discrete quantum groups are studied in [\cite=VV] and [\cite=VVe].

In this paper, we first characterize when a right coideal is of quotient type and second apply the characterization to determine Poisson boundaries of amenable discrete quantum groups with the commutative fusion rules. A right coideal of quotient type has the following two properties. The first one is the expectation property, namely, existence of a normal conditional expectation preserving the Haar state from the function algebra. The second one is the coaction symmetry which means that the left action of the dual preserves the right coideal. Assuming amenability of the dual, we can prove the following theorem (Theorem [\ref=thm:_exco]).

Theorem 1. Let [formula] be a co-amenable compact quantum group and [formula] a right coideal. Then B is of quotient type if and only if B has the expectation property and the coaction symmetry.

Next we study a Poisson boundary of an amenable discrete quantum group. In order to compute a Poisson boundary, we present an approach which differs from that of [\cite=INT]. The key point of our proof is to construct an "inverse"of the Poisson integral. Although this strategy is the same as the one taken in [\cite=INT], we do it by utilizing not the Berezin transforms but an invariant mean of a dual discrete quantum group. Then using Theorem 1, we show that the Poisson boundary is isomorphic to a right coideal of quotient type by a quantum subgroup. Moreover, we can specify the quantum subgroup which is the maximal quantum subgroup of Kac type with respect to inclusions. After this work was done, we learned from S. Vaes that the notion has been already introduced as the canonical Kac quotient in [\cite=So]. Our main result is the following theorem (Theorem [\ref=thm:_poisson]).

Theorem 2. Let [formula] be a co-amenable compact quantum group. Assume that its fusion algebra is commutative. Then the following statements hold.

(1) There exists a unique maximal quantum subgroup of Kac type [formula].

(2) The Poisson integral [formula] is an isomorphism.

In particular, [formula] is of Kac type if and only if [formula]. This yields the minimality of an infinite tensor product actions of [formula]. For a q-deformed classical compact Lie group [formula], the maximal quantum subgroup of Kac type is the maximal torus [formula]. Therefore, we obtain the following result (Corollary [\ref=cor:_flag]).

Theorem 3. Let [formula] be the q-deformation of a classical compact Lie group [formula]. Then the Poisson integral [formula] is an isomorphism.

Notations. Let M be a von Neumann algebra with predual M*. We denote by M+* the set of positive functionals in M*. For a linear functional θ on M, we define a linear functional [formula] by [formula] for x∈M. For a weight φ on M, we set [formula], [formula]. We denote by [formula] the set of positive elements in [formula]. For a linear subspace X  ⊂  M, we denote by [formula] the weak closure of X. We denote by [formula] the minimal tensor product for C*-algebras and the spatial tensor product for von Neumann algebras.

Preliminaries

We collect necessary results on compact (discrete) quantum groups.

Our standard references are [\cite=BS], [\cite=I1], [\cite=Wor3]. For the notion of a compact quantum group, we adopt the definition in [\cite=Wor3] as follows:

A compact quantum group [formula] is a pair [formula] which satisfies the following conditions:

[formula] is a separable unital C*-algebra.

The map [formula] is a coproduct, i.e. it is a faithful unital *  -homomorphism satisfying the coassociativity condition,

[formula]

The vector spaces [formula] and [formula] are dense in [formula].

Let [formula] be the Haar state on [formula] which satisfies the invariance condition,

[formula]

In this paper, we always assume that the Haar states are faithful. If the Haar state is tracial, we say that the compact quantum group is of Kac type [\cite=EnSch]. Let [formula] be the GNS triple of [formula], which consists of the representation, the Hilbert space and the GNS cyclic vector, respectively. We always omit πh and regard [formula] as a C*-subalgebra of [formula]. We set a von Neumann algebra [formula].

The multiplicative unitaries [formula] and [formula] are defined by

[formula]

[formula]

Then we have the pentagon equalities,

[formula]

[formula]

Using them, we can extend the coproduct [formula] to [formula] by

[formula]

The normal state [formula], [formula] is invariant under [formula]. Since [formula] on [formula] has the modular automorphism group [\cite=Wor3], [formula] is also faithful on [formula]. Then the pair [formula] is a von Neumann algebraic compact quantum group in the sense of [\cite=KV].

Let H be a Hilbert space and [formula] a unitary. If [formula], we say that v is a right unitary representation of [formula]. A left unitary representation is similarly defined. For example, the unitaries [formula] and [formula] are left and right unitary representations, respectively. Let [formula] be a unitary representation. Suppose that T∈B(H) satisfies [formula]. If any such element T must be a scalar, v is said to be irreducible. Any unitary representation is completely decomposable, that is, it is a direct sum of irreducible ones. The set of the equivalence classes of all the irreducible representations is denoted by [formula]. For [formula], we choose a representation Hilbert space Hπ and an irreducible representation [formula]. We call an irreducible representation [formula] the trivial representation and denote by [formula] the equivalence class.

We define a dense unital *  -subalgebra [formula] by

[formula]

It is clear that [formula]. We define the Hopf algebra structure, namely, the antipode [formula] and the counit [formula] on [formula] as follows. The invertible antimultiplicative map [formula] is defined by

[formula]

The unital *  -homomorphism [formula] is defined by

[formula]

In fact [formula] is a Hopf *  -algebra, that is, [formula] holds for any [formula]. For any finite dimensional unitary representation [formula], we have [formula] and [formula], which follow from the complete decomposability of v.

We introduce the Woronowicz characters [formula] on [formula] [\cite=Wor3]. The multiplicative functional [formula] satisfies the following properties:

[formula].

For any [formula], the function [formula] is entirely holomorphic.

[formula] for any [formula].

For any [formula] and [formula], [formula], [formula].

For any [formula], [formula].

For any [formula], [formula].

The modular automorphism group [formula] is given by

[formula]

We define the following map [formula] by

[formula]

Then [formula] is a one-parameter automorphism group on [formula] and it is called the scaling automorphism group. Note that any element of [formula] is analytic for [formula] and [formula]. Define a map [formula] by

[formula]

Then [formula] is a *  -antiautomorphism on [formula] with [formula]. We call [formula] the unitary antipode. Actually [formula] commutes with [formula] for all [formula], and it satisfies

[formula]

Since the Haar state [formula] is invariant under the *  -preserving maps [formula], [formula] and [formula], we can extend them to the maps on [formula], moreover on [formula]. Then the following relations among [formula] and them hold.

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula].

Let [formula] be a finite dimensional unitary representation. Set [formula]. Then [formula] satisfies the following properties:

[formula] is a non-singular positive operator on H.

For any [formula], [formula].

For any [formula], [formula].

For any [formula], [formula].

Let [formula] be a finite dimensional unitary representation of [formula]. If a linear map [formula] satisfies [formula], then TFv = FwT.

For [formula], we write [formula] (or simply Fπ) for [formula]. Let [formula] be the non-normalized trace on B(Hπ). Set [formula]. Then we have the orthogonal relations,

[formula]

We decompose [formula] and [formula] into irreducible representations. For [formula], we define two systems of matrix units {eπi,j}i,j∈Iπ and {fπi,j}i,j∈Iπ in [formula] by

[formula]

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

Setting [formula] at ([\ref=eq:_epi]), we have

[formula]

The projection [formula] is minimal in [formula].

We will need some relations among [formula], [formula] and the modular objects of [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula] be the modular operator and the modular conjugation of [formula]. We define a conjugate unitary [formula] by [formula] for [formula]. We set a unitary [formula]. The implementing unitary [formula] for [formula] is defined by [formula] for [formula] and [formula]. Then the following equalities are directly deduced from ([\ref=eq:_W]), ([\ref=eq:_V]), ([\ref=eq:_de1]) and ([\ref=eq:_de2]).

[formula]

We denote by [formula] the set of [formula] which satisfies ω(vπi,j) = 0, i,j∈Iπ all but finite elements [formula]. We simply write symbols by omitting [formula], if no confusion arise. For example, we write δ for [formula].

The notions of a (dual) discrete quantum group have been studied in many papers, for example, [\cite=EfRu], [\cite=KV], [\cite=VanDaele], [\cite=Wor2] and [\cite=Ya]. They have described essentially the same object. In this paper, we use a von Neumann algebraic quantum group presented in [\cite=KV].

A discrete quantum group is a quintuplet (M,Δ,φ,ψ,ε) which satisfies the following conditions:

M is a separable von Neumann algebra.

[formula] is a coproduct, that is, it is a faithful normal unital *  -homomorphism satisfying the coassociativity condition,

[formula]

φ is a faithful normal semifinite weight on M satisfying the left invariance,

[formula]

ψ is a faithful normal semifinite weight on M satisfying the right invariance,

[formula]

ε is a normal counit, that is, it is a normal character on M satisfying

[formula]

In fact, those weights φ, ψ are uniquely determined up to scalar multiplications and the counit ε is unique. From now, we simply write (M,Δ) for (M,Δ,φ,ψ,ε) by omitting φ, ψ and ε once they are given.

For a compact quantum group [formula], we construct the dual discrete quantum group as follows (see for example [\cite=BS], [\cite=KV]). We define the left group algebra and right group algebra by

[formula]

By ([\ref=eq:_decomp]), [formula] and [formula] are generated by {fπi,j} and {eπi,j}, respectively. Hence they are isomorphic to the von Neumann algebra direct sum of the matrix algebras [formula]. Set

[formula]

They are algebraic direct sum of the matrix algebras. We note the commutant property [formula]. We define a minimal central projection corresponding to [formula] by [formula]. In particular, [formula]. We denote by [formula] the subset of [formula] which consists of [formula] such that ω(fπi,j) = 0, i,j∈Iπ all but finite elements [formula].

We prepare the coproducts ΔL and ΔR defined by

[formula]

[formula]

We define the normal counit [formula] by

[formula]

In fact, there exist left, right invariant weights on [formula] and [formula] [\cite=KV], and they are discrete quantum groups. Note that every discrete quantum group arises as the left (right) group algebra of a compact quantum group (see [\cite=BS] [\cite=KV] for duality theory). In this paper, we use the symbol [formula] for the discrete quantum group [formula]. We simply write [formula] (or Δ) for ΔL and ΔR when it is not ambiguous.

We define a positive operator F affiliated with [formula] by

[formula]

Using ([\ref=eq:_fpi]), for all [formula] and [formula] we have

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

The antipode Ŝ on [formula] is defined as follows. Since the map [formula] is injective, we can define an invertible antimultiplicative map [formula] by

[formula]

We define the unitary antipode R̂ and the scaling automorphism group [formula] on [formula] by

[formula]

Using ([\ref=eq:_JW]), ([\ref=eq:_PW]) and ([\ref=eq:_vDP]), we have [formula] on [formula]. The relations among Δ, R̂ and τ̂ are as follows.

[formula]

Take [formula] satisfying [formula]. Let [formula] be the multiplication map. We prove the well-known results for readers' convenience.

For any [formula] and [formula], one has

[formula]

where [formula].

We prove [formula]. Since [formula] is non-zero for finite elements [formula], we may assume that [formula], [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Similarly we can prove [formula].

Let K be a Hilbert space and [formula] a unitary representation of [formula], that is, [formula] is a unitary satisfying [formula]. Then for any [formula], one has

[formula]

where [formula].

Set [formula], ω∈B(K)*. For any [formula], we have

[formula]

By the previous lemma, we have [formula]. This implies [formula] for any ω∈B(K)*. Hence [formula].

We recall the notion of amenability of a discrete quantum group. For a detail of the theory, readers are referred to [\cite=BeCoTu], [\cite=BeMuTu1], [\cite=BeMuTu2], [\cite=To1] and references therein. A discrete quantum group (M,Δ) is said to be amenable if there exists a state m∈M* such that [formula] for all ω∈M* and x∈M. The state m is called a left invariant mean. It is known that [formula] is amenable if and only if [formula] is amenable. If it is the case, we say that [formula] is co-amenable. Note that the counit [formula] is norm-bounded if and only if [formula] is co-amenable [\cite=BeMuTu2], [\cite=To1]. The amenability is also equivalent to the universality of [formula], that is, for any C*-algebra B, any *  -homomorphism [formula] extends to a *  -homomorphism [formula] [\cite=BeMuTu1].

We prepare two maps [formula] and [formula] which will be frequently used in our study. A map α is defined by

[formula]

Then α is a right action of [formula] on [formula], that is, [formula] holds. The conditional expectation [formula] maps [formula] onto [formula]. The other one, β is defined by

[formula]

Then β is a left action of [formula] on [formula], that is, [formula] holds. We also call β a coaction of [formula]. Note that both the actions α, β preserve not only [formula] but also [formula].

We introduce the notion of a right coideal. Our basic references for theory of right coideals are [\cite=ILP] and [\cite=To2].

Let [formula] be a compact quantum group. Let [formula] be a von Neumann subalgebra. We say that B is a right coideal if [formula].

A left coideal in [formula] is similarly defined. For a right coideal [formula] and a left coideal [formula], we define

[formula]

We prove a quantum group version of [\cite=ILP] as follows.

Let [formula] be a compact quantum group. Let [formula] be a right coideal and [formula] a left coideal.

[formula] is a left coideal and [formula] is a right coideal.

The map B  ↦  B̂ is a lattice anti-isomorphism between the set of right coideal of [formula] and left coideal of [formula]. The inverse map is given by C  ↦  Ĉ.

(1). It is similarly proved as in [\cite=ILP].

(2). First we show that the map C  ↦  Ĉ is injective. Let [formula] be a left coideal. Then [formula]. We can adapt the proof of [\cite=ILP] to deduce [formula]. Recall the right [formula]-action α on [formula] and the conditional expectation [formula]. We apply [formula] to [formula]. Since [formula] and the restriction of Eα to [formula] is the Haar state h, we have Eα(JĈ'J) = JCJ. Hence the map C  ↦  Ĉ is injective. Set B = Ĉ. Then [formula] holds. The injectivity of the map C  ↦  Ĉ yields B̂ = C.

Next we show that the map B  ↦  B̂ is injective. Let [formula], i = 1,2 be right coideals. Then [formula]. Let [formula] be the crossed product. Then we have [formula]. Hence B̂1  =  B̂2 if and only if [formula]. Then the biduality theorem (see [\cite=BS] or [\cite=Vaes1]) implies that it is equivalent to [formula], and B1 = B2. Hence the map B  ↦  B̂ is injective.

For the definition of quantum subgroups, we follow that of [\cite=Po2], in which matrix pseudogroups [\cite=Wor1] are treated.

Let [formula] and [formula] be compact quantum groups.

Suppose that there exists a surjective *  -homomorphism [formula] such that [formula]. Then we say that the pair [formula] is an algebraic quantum subgroup of [formula].

Suppose that there exists a surjective *  -homomorphism [formula] such that [formula]. Then we say that the pair [formula] is a quantum subgroup of [formula].

In the above cases, the map [formula] is called a restriction map. We present basic properties on (algebraic) quantum subgroups in the following lemmas. Those are probably well-known for specialists, but we prove them for the sake of readers' convenience.

Let [formula] and [formula] be compact quantum groups.

If [formula] is a quantum subgroup of [formula], then it is an algebraic quantum subgroup of [formula].

Suppose [formula] is co-amenable. Then any algebraic quantum subgroup of [formula] is naturally regarded as a quantum subgroup.

(1). Let [formula]. Then [formula] is a finite dimensional unitary representation of [formula]. Hence it is a finite direct sum of irreducible representations of [formula]. This implies [formula]. Hence [formula]. Next we show the converse inclusion. Take any [formula]. Let [formula] be a corresponding irreducible unitary representation. Consider the bounded linear map [formula] defined by [formula]. Since [formula] is surjective, θ is a non-zero map. By density of [formula], There exists [formula] such that [formula]. This shows that the unitary representation [formula] contains wρ. Hence all the entries of wρ are contained in [formula], and [formula].

(2). Let [formula] be a restriction map. Since [formula] is universal, the map extends to [formula]. The image contains a total subspace [formula] in [formula], and [formula] is surjective. By continuity of [formula], the relation [formula] holds on [formula]. Hence [formula] is a quantum subgroup of [formula].

Let [formula] be an algebraic quantum subgroup of [formula]. On [formula],

[formula],

[formula] for all [formula],

[formula].

(1). Take any [formula]. Since [formula] is a unitary representation of [formula], [formula]. This implies [formula].

(2). Take any [formula]. Since [formula] is a unitary representation of [formula], [formula]. This implies [formula]. Since [formula] and [formula], we have [formula]. Let [formula] and set [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

This shows [formula] is an intertwiner of w, and in particular, [formula] holds. Hence [formula]. Since the positive operators [formula] and [formula] commute, kπ is positive. In particular, we have [formula] for all [formula]. Hence for any [formula], we have

[formula]

Therefore the desired relation holds.

(3). It follows from [formula] and (2).

Let [formula] be an algebraic quantum subgroup of [formula]. Since [formula] for any [formula], we can define a left unitary representation of [formula], [formula] by

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] be compact quantum groups.

Assume that [formula] is an algebraic quantum subgroup of [formula]. Then there exists a faithful normal unital *  -homomorphism [formula] such that

[formula]

Assume that there exists a faithful normal unital *  -homomorphism [formula] such that

[formula]

Then there exists a restriction map [formula] such that [formula].

(1). Since the map [formula] is injective, we can define a linear map [formula] by

[formula]

It is easy to verify the multiplicativity of [formula] by the pentagon equalities ([\ref=eq:_Wpenta]) on [formula] and [formula]. We show that [formula] preserves the involutions. Take any [formula] and [formula]. Using the equality [formula], we have

[formula]

Hence [formula] is a *  -homomorphism. Since [formula] is a von Neumann algebra direct sum of [formula], the map [formula] extends to a normal *  -homomorphism from [formula] to [formula]. Then the desired equality holds. We show that [formula] is unital. Take any [formula] and [formula]. Let [formula] be the multiplicity of ρ in the unitary representation [formula]. Then the map [formula] is the [formula] times amplification, and [formula] is unital. Since [formula] is surjective, [formula] is injective.

(2). Since the linear map [formula] is injective, we can define a linear map [formula] by

[formula]

First we show that [formula] is multiplicative. Take any [formula]. Then [formula], and

[formula]

Next we show [formula] preserves the involutions. Let [formula]. Take [formula] such that ω is equal to zero on B(Hρ) if [formula]. Since [formula], [formula] is a unitary representation of the discrete quantum group [formula]. Set [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:_anti-repn], we have [formula]. Then

[formula]

By taking summations on ω, we see that the above equality holds for any [formula]. Hence [formula] is a unital *  -homomorphism. Let [formula]. Then there exists [formula] such that [formula]. Then we have [formula]. Hence [formula] is surjective. Finally we show that [formula] is a restriction map. Let [formula]. Then

[formula]

Hence [formula] is an algebraic quantum subgroup of [formula]. It is clear that [formula] by definition of [formula].

On heredity of co-amenability to quantum subgroups, we have the following lemma.

Let [formula] be a compact quantum group. Then the following statements are equivalent:

[formula] is co-amenable.

Any quantum subgroup of [formula] is co-amenable.

There exists a co-amenable quantum subgroup of [formula].

The implication (2) to (3) is trivial. Suppose (3) holds. Let [formula] be a co-amenable quantum subgroup. Then [formula] is bounded, and (1) holds. We have to show that (1) implies (2). Let [formula] be a quantum subgroup of [formula]. By the previous lemma, there exists an embedding map [formula] preserving the coproducts. Let [formula] be a left invariant mean. Then the state [formula] is also a left invariant mean on [formula]. Hence the discrete quantum group [formula] is amenable, and [formula] is co-amenable.

Let [formula] be a quantum subgroup of [formula]. We define a map [formula] by [formula] for [formula]. Then [formula] is a left action of [formula] on [formula], that is, [formula] satisfies [formula]. We set the fixed point algebra [formula]. Since the action [formula] preserves the Haar state of [formula], it extends to an action on [formula]. We denote the fixed point algebra by [formula] as well. Then [formula] is the range of the conditional expectation [formula].

We often identify [formula] with the subalgebra of [formula] via the inclusion map [formula] defined in Lemma [\ref=lem:_algsub-corresp]. By the identification, we have [formula]. Similarly, we can do [formula] and [formula]. Then the left action of [formula] on [formula] is given by [formula] for [formula].

In the above setting, one has

[formula]

By definition of [formula], [formula] if and only if [formula]. It is equivalent to [formula]. Hence [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:_lattice], we obtain the second equality.

Let [formula] and [formula] be quantum subgroups of [formula]. Assume that [formula]. Then there exists a *  -isomorphism [formula] such that [formula] on [formula].

By the previous lemma, we have [formula]. Applying Lemma [\ref=lem:_algsub-corresp] to left group algebra [formula], we have a *  -isomorphism [formula] such that [formula]. This implies [formula], and [formula] on [formula].

Right coideals of quotient type

Let [formula] be a right coideal. We say that

B is of quotient type if there exists a quantum subgroup [formula] of [formula] such that [formula],

B has the expectation property if there exists a faithful normal conditional expectation [formula] such that [formula],

B has the coaction symmetry if [formula].

Typical examples of right coideals are given by taking quotients. In fact, they have the expectation property and the coaction symmetry as follows.

A right coideal of quotient type has the expectation property and the coaction symmetry.

Let [formula] be a quantum subgroup of [formula]. Set [formula]. It is easy to see that the conditional expectation [formula] preserves the Haar state h. Next we verify the coaction symmetry. Let [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

Hence [formula]. By weak continuity of β, [formula].

In fact assuming the co-amenability [formula], We prove the converse statement of the previous lemma in Theorem [\ref=thm:_exco].

Let [formula] be a right coideal. We denote by L2(B) the norm closure of the space Bh. Assume that B has the expectation property, that is, there exists a conditional expectation [formula] such that EB preserves the Haar state h. Define the Jones projection [formula] by

[formula]

Let [formula] be the basic extension. The main properties of eB are as follows (see [\cite=Ko1] and [\cite=Ta]).

With the above settings, one has

eBxeB = EB(x)eB for [formula],

[formula],

JeB = eBJ, [formula] for all [formula],

B1 = JB'J.

Set [formula]. Then B̂ is a left coideal of [formula] as is shown in Lemma [\ref=lem:_lattice]. The following lemma is proved in [\cite=ILP], which treats the Kac algebra case. The proof can be adapted to the quantum group case.

With the above setting, one has

eB∈B̂,

[formula] for all [formula],

[formula].

(1). Since B is a right coideal, we see that [formula]. Hence [formula]. Since [formula] and JeBJ = eB, [formula]. Hence [formula].

(2). Let [formula]. Since [formula] and [formula], we have

[formula]

In particular, we have [formula]. Since [formula] is a separating vector for [formula], we have [formula].

(3). It follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:_lattice] or the direct argument as follows. It is clear that [formula]. Since eB∈B̂ and [formula], [formula].

Next we consider a relation between B̂ and B1. Let α be the right [formula]-action α on [formula] defined in § [\ref=subsect:_al-be]. Since [formula] commutes with [formula], B1 is globally invariant under the right action α. Let X be a globally invariant subspace in B1. The set of the fixed point elements of X under α is denoted by [formula]. Note that [formula] holds.

The following equalities hold:

R̂(eB) = eB.

[formula].

[formula].

(1). Since e*B = eB and JeB = eBJ, we have R̂(eB) = Je*BJ = eB.

(2). Take any [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

Hence the desired equality holds.

(3). Since B1 = JB'J and [formula], we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem:_Jones], the *  -subalgebra [formula] is weakly dense in B1. Hence we have [formula].

One has

[formula]

Let [formula], i,j∈Iπ and [formula]. Then

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Using the description of [formula] in ([\ref=eq:_decomp]), we have

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

One has [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=lem:_eB], it suffices to show that the unit of B1 is equal to that of [formula]. Let [formula] be the unit of the von Neumann subalgebra generated by [formula]. Set q = 1 - p. Then by the previous lemma, we have [formula]. Since R̂(eB) = eB by Lemma [\ref=lem:_eB], we have

[formula]

The equality [formula] yields [formula], and [formula]. Since EB is faithful, we have q = 0.

One has

[formula]

The left equality follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:_AGeB] and the previous lemma. Take [formula]. By ([\ref=eq:_DehR]) and Lemma [\ref=lem:_eB], we have

[formula]

Hence the right equality holds since [formula].

To construct a left invariant weight on B̂, we make use of theory of spatial derivatives and operator valued weights which have been introduced in [\cite=Co], [\cite=Ha1] and [\cite=Ha2]. Readable explanations on them are presented in [\cite=Ko2] and we freely use the notations there. Let [formula] be the operator valued weights associated with [formula]. It is characterized by the following equality on spatial derivatives:

[formula]

where ω' and ω are faithful normal semifinite weights on [formula] and B, respectively. The equality E- 1B(eB) = 1 holds [\cite=Ko1]. We define the *  -subalgebra B̂0 of B̂ by

[formula]

The operator valued weight E- 1B is finite on B̂0. In particular, E- 1B is semifinite on B̂.

Set a unitary [formula]. Then for any [formula], we have

[formula]

Now take a positive functional [formula]. Then by [formula]-linearity of E- 1B, we have

[formula]

Hence E- 1B is finite on B̂0.

Define a state [formula] by h'(x) = h(Jx*J) for [formula]. Set a faithful normal semifinite weight [formula] on B'. We denote by [formula] the restriction φ on B̂.

The modular automorphism group [formula] preserves B̂0.

By ([\ref=eq:_spatial]), we obtain

[formula]

Hence [formula] on B'. Since [formula] on [formula] by ([\ref=eq:_vDP]) and ([\ref=eq:_hRhta]), the von Neumann subalgebra B̂  ⊂  B' is globally invariant under σφt. Hence [formula] by uniqueness of the modular automorphism group. Since eB commutes with [formula], [formula]. Then for any [formula],

[formula]

by ([\ref=eq:_DehR]) and τ̂t(eB) = eB. By definition of B̂0 ([\ref=eq:_hB0]), we have [formula].

By previous lemma, the following push-down lemma is proved in a similar way to [\cite=ILP].

For any [formula], eBx = eBE- 1B(eBx) holds.

One has [formula].

It suffices to show [formula], where [formula] is the linear span of {vπi,j}i,j∈Iπ. Take any [formula]. Then

[formula]

because [formula] for any [formula].

The weight [formula] is left invariant, that is, for any [formula] and [formula], one has

[formula]

Take [formula] and set [formula]. By using the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:_semi], we have E- 1B(x) = θ(1). Then for any [formula],

[formula]

Hence on B̂0, the left invariance holds.

Take a bounded sequence [formula] in B̂0 which strongly converges to 1. Let [formula]. Then by Lemma [\ref=lem:_push-down], [formula] for each [formula]. Since [formula], we see that [formula]. Using Lemma [\ref=lem:_B0], we see that [formula]. Hence for any positive [formula], we have

[formula]

Taking the limit as n  →    ∞   in ([\ref=eq:_yuuy]), we have

[formula]

In particular, the map [formula] is a normal functional. Hence again taking the limit as n  →    ∞   in ([\ref=eq:_yuuy]), we have

[formula]

Therefore [formula] is left invariant on [formula].

We summarize our arguments as follows.

Let [formula] be a right coideal. If B has the expectation property, then the left coideal B̂ has a left invariant faithful normal semifinite weight for the left action of [formula].

Next we study a right coideal of [formula] endowed with the coaction symmetry.

Let [formula] be a right coideal. Then B has the coaction symmetry if and only if Δ(  ⊂  .

We know [formula]. Let x∈B and y∈. Then we have

[formula]

and similarly

[formula]

Hence Δ(  ⊂   if and only if [formula].

Set a weight [formula] on B̂. Using ([\ref=eq:_DehR]), we see that [formula] is right invariant. Therefore (B̂,Δ) is a quantum group in the sense of [\cite=KV]. Clearly the restriction [formula] is a normal counit on B̂. Hence (B̂,Δ) is a discrete quantum group. The counit [formula] is given by cutting elements at the Jones projection eB as follows.

The equality [formula] holds for all x∈B̂. In particular, the Jones projection eB is a minimal central projection of B̂.

By Lemma [\ref=lem:_eB], [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

Taking the adjoint of the above equality, we have

[formula]

Take any [formula] and set [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

Similarly we obtain [formula]. Then the desired equality holds for all x∈B̂ by Lemma [\ref=lem:_B_1].

We summarize our arguments as follows.

Let [formula] be a right coideal. If B has the expectation property and the coaction symmetry, then the pair (B̂,Δ) is a discrete quantum group.

Under assumption on co-amenability, we obtain the following characterization of right coideals of quotient type.

Let [formula] be a co-amenable compact quantum group and [formula] a right coideal. Then B is of quotient type if and only if B has the expectation property and the coaction symmetry.

We have already proved the "only if" part in Lemma [\ref=lem:_exco]. So, it suffices to show the "if" part. By the previous theorem, (B̂,Δ) is a discrete quantum group. Let [formula] be a compact quantum group such that the discrete quantum groups [formula] and (B̂,Δ) are isomorphic. We identify B̂ with [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:_algsub-corresp], [formula] is represented as an algebraic quantum subgroup of [formula], that is, there exists a restriction map [formula] such that [formula] is a given inclusion. Moreover by Lemma [\ref=lem:_algsub], [formula] is in fact a quantum subgroup of [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:_above] and Lemma [\ref=lem:_Jones], we have [formula].

Application to classification of Poisson boundaries

In the rest of this paper, we determine the Poisson boundary for a co-amenable compact quantum group with the commutative fusion rules. We also compute the Poisson boundary for a q-deformed classical compact Lie group.

We briefly recall the notion of the Poisson boundary for a discrete quantum group. We refer to [\cite=I1], [\cite=INT] and [\cite=NT] for definitions of terminology.

Let φπ∈B(Hπ)* be the right [formula]-invariant state. Define a transition operator Pπ on [formula] by [formula] for [formula]. For a probability measure μ on [formula], we set a non-commutative Markov operator

[formula]

Then for a generating measure μ, we define an operator system

[formula]

It has the von Neumann algebra structure defined by

[formula]

where the limit is taken in the strong topology [\cite=I1]. The von Neumann algebra [formula] is called the (non-commutative) Poisson boundary of [formula]. Assuming that the fusion algebra of [formula] is commutative, we know that the Poisson boundary does not depend on the generating measure [\cite=INT], that is, we have

[formula]

We are interested only in such a compact quantum group, so we write simply [formula] for [formula]. The Poisson integral [formula] is defined by

[formula]

which maps [formula] into [formula] [\cite=I1]. It is [formula]-[formula]-equivariant in the following sense:

[formula]

Now we consider how the inverse map of Θ can be constructed. That will be written as a similar form to ([\ref=eq:_Poisson]), that is, α and some state ω on [formula] will take the place of β and h, respectively. Then we consider the map [formula]. The inverse of Θ (if it exists) should be [formula]-[formula]-equivariant as Θ is. Here, we have to realize what property of h derives the bi-equivariance of Θ in the proof of [\cite=I1]. While the [formula]-equivariance follows by definition of the left action, the [formula]-equivariance does by right invariance of h. Hence the state ω has to satisfy the left invariance for the coproduct ΔR.

From now we assume the amenability of [formula]. Let [formula] be a left invariant mean. Although m is non-normal in general, we can consider a unital completely positive map [formula] for any von Neumann algebra M. Indeed for any [formula], we define an element [formula] by [formula] for ω∈M*. Let M and N be von Neumann algebras and [formula] a normal completely bounded map. Then [formula] holds. Here we need to assume the normalcy of T. In particular, we have [formula] for all [formula] and a,b∈M.

Now define a unital completely positive map [formula] by

[formula]

It turns out that Λ is normal on the Poisson boundary [formula] in the next lemma. Moreover by Theorem [\ref=thm:_poisson], we will see that Λ is actually equal to Θ* defined in [\cite=INT]. This means that Λ does not depend on the choice of an left invariant mean.

The following statements hold.

[formula] on [formula]. In particular, Λ is a faithful normal map.

Λ is [formula]-[formula]-equivariant, that is,

[formula]

(1). Since the fusion algebra of [formula] is commutative, the action α on [formula] is ergodic [\cite=I1]. Hence [formula] for all [formula]. Then [formula]. Since h and [formula] are faithful normal states [\cite=I1], we conclude that Λ is a faithful normal map.

(2). First we show the [formula]-equivariance of Λ. Let [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

Next we show the [formula]-equivariance of Λ. The left invariance of m yields [formula] for all [formula]. Take any [formula] and then

[formula]

For any [formula], Θ(Λ(x)) = x. In particular, Λ is a faithful normal *  -homomorphism.

Let [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:_equiv], we have

[formula]

The multiplicativity of Λ is shown as follows. For any [formula], we have

[formula]

Hence we obtain Θ(Λ(x)*Λ(x)) = Θ(Λ(x*  ·  x)), namely, Λ(x)*Λ(x) = Λ(x*  ·  x). This implies that Λ is a *  -homomorphism.

We determine the multiplicative domain of Θ.

Set [formula].

B is a right coideal with the expectation property and the coaction symmetry.

The conditional expectation onto B is [formula]-equivariant.

B coincides with the multiplicative domain of Θ. Moreover, the Poisson integral [formula] is an isomorphism.

(1). By the previous lemma, [formula] is a von Neumann subalgebra. Since Λ is [formula]-[formula]-equivariant by Lemma [\ref=lem:_equiv], B is globally invariant under the actions α and β. Hence B is a right coideal with the coaction symmetry. Set [formula]. Then by the previous lemma, we see that EB is a faithful normal conditional expectation onto B. For [formula], we have

[formula]

Hence B has the expectation property.

(2). Since Θ and Λ are [formula]-equivariant, [formula] is also [formula]-equivariant.

(3). Let [formula] be the multiplicative domain of Θ. It is easy to see that B  ⊂  D. We show the converse inclusion. Let x∈D. Then by definition, we have Θ(x*x) = Θ(x)*  ·  Θ(x) and Θ(xx*) = Θ(x)  ·  Θ(x)*. Applying Λ to both the sides of the equalities, we have EB(x*x) = EB(x)*EB(x) and EB(xx*) = EB(x)EB(x)*. This immediately yields that x∈B, and B = D. Hence [formula] is a faithful normal *  -homomorphism. The surjectivity of Θ follows from [formula].

Let [formula] be a quantum subgroup of [formula]. Then [formula] is of Kac type if and only if the expectation [formula] is [formula]-equivariant, that is, it satisfies [formula].

For any [formula], we have

[formula]

This is equal to [formula] if and only if

[formula]

Multiplying [formula], [formula] from the right, we have

[formula]

Since the subspace [formula] is dense in [formula], we have for all [formula],

[formula]

More precisely, we have

[formula]

This shows that [formula] is [formula]-equivariant if and only if the image of the Poisson integral of [formula] consists of scalars. By [\cite=I1], it is equivalent to that [formula] is of Kac type.

Let [formula] be a quantum subgroup of Kac type in [formula]. Then [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=lem:_Kac], [formula] is [formula]-equivariant. For any [formula], we have

[formula]

We prepare the notion of maximality for a quantum subgroup of Kac type as follows.

Let [formula] be a compact quantum group. We say that a quantum subgroup [formula] of Kac type is maximal if for any quantum subgroup [formula] of Kac type, we have [formula].

Let [formula] be a compact quantum subgroup. If there exists a maximal quantum subgroup of Kac type, it is unique in the following sense. Let [formula] and [formula] be maximal quantum subgroups of Kac type. Then there exists a *  -isomorphism [formula] such that [formula].

By definition, we have [formula]. Then by Lemma [\ref=lem:_subs], we have the desired *  -isomorphism.

Let [formula] be a co-amenable compact quantum group. Assume that its fusion algebra is commutative. Then the following statements hold.

There exists a unique maximal quantum subgroup of Kac type [formula].

The Poisson integral [formula] is an isomorphism.

(1). By using Theorem [\ref=thm:_exco], Lemma [\ref=lem:_Kac] and Lemma [\ref=lem:_prepoisson], there exists a quantum subgroup [formula] of Kac type such that [formula]. We show the maximality of [formula]. Let [formula] be another quantum subgroup of Kac type. By Lemma [\ref=lem:_factor], [formula]. Since [formula], we have [formula]. Let [formula] be the Jones projection associated with [formula]. Then [formula], and hence [formula]. It yields [formula]. Hence [formula] is maximal.

(2). It follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:_prepoisson] (3).

We have realized the existence of the maximal quantum subgroup of Kac type by studying the Poisson integral. However, the notion has been already introduced in [\cite=So], where it is called the canonical Kac quotient. The canonical Kac quotient is the function algebra on the maximal quantum subgroup of Kac type. The existence is proved for an arbitrary compact quantum group [\cite=So].

We determine the maximal quantum subgroup of Kac type in a q-deformed classical compact Lie group (0 < q < 1). In order to do so, we freely make use of terminology and results in [\cite=KS] such as construction of quantum universal enveloping algebras, quantized function algebras and so on.

Let [formula] be a complex classical simple Lie algebra with the simple roots {αi}ni = 1. We denote by [formula] the corresponding classical compact Lie group [\cite=KS]. Let [formula] be the quantum universal enveloping algebra associated with [formula] [\cite=KS]. We equip [formula] with the Hopf *  -algebra structure as in [\cite=KS]. We denote by W the Weyl group and by si the simple reflection with respect to αi.

For a dominant integral weight λ, we denote by Lq(λ) the irreducible [formula]-module with the highest weight λ. Fix an orthonormal basis {ξrμ}r of each weight space Lq(λ)μ with the weight μ. We define [formula] by

[formula]

Then we have [formula]. On the involution, we have

[formula]

where [formula] is the Weyl vector and w0∈W is the longest element. Let κ and [formula] be the antipode and the scaling automorphism group of [formula] introduced in § [\ref=subsect:_cqg]. From ([\ref=eq:_antipode]), κ2  =  τ- i and ([\ref=eq:_involution]), we obtain

[formula]

We denote by [formula] the C*-completion of [formula] with respect to the universal norm. Set qi = q(αi,αi) / 2, [formula]. Let Uqi(su(2)) be the quantized universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra su(2) with the deformation parameter qi. The canonical embedding [formula] induces the restriction map [formula] [\cite=KS]. Since [formula] is a universal C*-algebra, ri extends to the *  -homomorphism [formula]. Take a canonical infinite dimensional irreducible representation [formula] defined in [\cite=KS]. We note that the counit εi of C(SUqi(2)) factors through [formula], that is, there exists a *  -homomorphism [formula] such that [formula]. Indeed, let [formula] be the canonical surjection onto the Calkin algebra [formula]. Let [formula] be the unilateral shift. By definition of πi, we see that [formula] is a commutative C*-algebra generated by a unitary p(S). Take the character [formula] defined by ω(p(S)) = 1. Then the character [formula] has the desired property.

Let [formula] be the maximal torus subgroup of [formula], where [formula] is a restriction map. Any one dimensional *  -homomorphism of [formula] is given by [formula], where [formula] is the evaluation at [formula]. Then for an element [formula] with a reduced decomposition [formula] and [formula], we define

[formula]

where [formula] is recursively defined by [formula] and [formula]. Then πw,t is an irreducible *  -homomorphism of [formula] and does not depend on the choice of the reduced decomposition of w up to equivalence [\cite=KS]. Every irreducible *  -homomorphism of [formula] is equivalent to some πw,t [\cite=KS].

Let [formula] be the q-deformation of a classical compact Lie group [formula]. Then its maximal quantum subgroup of Kac type is the maximal torus [formula].

Let [formula] be a quantum subgroup of Kac type. We will show that [formula] is a subgroup of [formula]. Assume that [formula] is not commutative. Then there exists an irreducible *  -homomorphism [formula] with [formula]. Set [formula]. We may assume π  =  πw,t for some element [formula] with a reduced expression [formula] and [formula]. Then we consider the irreducible *  -homomorphism [formula], which factors through [formula]. Hence we may assume [formula] for some 1  ≤  j  ≤  n and [formula]. Since the scaling automorphism of [formula] is trivial, we have [formula] for all [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem:_algsub-scaling]. Let ωj be the fundamental weight for αj. Setting λ  =  μ  =  ωj and ν  =  ωj  -  αj, we have τt(Cωjξωj,ξωj  -  αj) = q2itjCωjξωj,ξωj  -  αj. Hence [formula]. In particular, πsj,t(Cωjξωj,ξωj  -  αj) = 0. This is, however, in contradiction with [formula] which is shown by direct computation.

Therefore [formula] is a commutative C*-algebra, that is, [formula] is an ordinary compact group. For [formula], we write [formula] for the character *  -homomorphism. For [formula], we also use [formula] as well. By the above arguments, for any [formula] there exists an element [formula] such that [formula]. This shows that the map [formula] is continuous. For any [formula], we have

[formula]

Hence the map [formula] is a group homomorphism. Next we show that t is injective. For [formula], suppose that [formula] holds. Since it is equal to the counit ε of [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem:_algsub-scaling], we have

[formula]

Hence x = e, and the map t is injective. Since the left action of [formula] is given by [formula], we have [formula]. Therefore [formula] is maximal.

By Theorem [\ref=thm:_poisson] and the previous lemma, we obtain the following corollary.

Let [formula] be the q-deformation of a classical compact Lie group [formula]. Then the Poisson integral [formula] is an isomorphism.
