Nonlinear Dynamics of Incoherent Superstrong Radiation in a Plasma

Introduction

A general new approach to the study of the interaction of spectrally broad and relativistically intense electromagnetic (EM) wave packets (photons) with a matter was developed in our previous papers[\cite=ltsin98], [\cite=ntsin98]. This was inspired by the fact that the bandwidth of an initially coherent spectrum may eventually broaden, as a result of the several kinds of instabilities and the nonlinear interactions, and naturally for ultrashort pulses the initial bandwidth is increasingly broad. Moreover, in astronomical plasmas there are a variety of sources of radiation, and in this case we speak about the average density of radiation from all the sources and their spectral distribution. It should be emphasized that the radiation can be in two distinct states. Namely, one is when the total number of photons is not conserved. A good example is a black-body radiation. Another situation is when the total number of photons is conserved. Both these states have been studied in several aspects, mostly for the weak radiation. In spite of the abundance of publications in this field, a class of problems remains highly complicated and speculative, particularly in the case when the intensity of radiation increases. Thus the study of property of such radiation (high-power, short pulse lasers with intensities up to 1021Wcm- 2, in which the photon density is of the order of 1030cm- 3, non-thermal equilibrium cosmic field radiation, etc.) is of vital importance. As was shown in Ref.[\cite=ltsin96] the photons acquire the rest mass and become one of the Bosons in plasmas and posses all characteristics of nonzero rest mass, i.e., we may say that the photon is the elementary particle of the optical field.

In the past a several reviews have been published on theory of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in a quantum Bose liquid[\cite=lif] and in trapped gases[\cite=dal]. Kompaneets[\cite=kom] has demonstrated that the equilibrium between photons and electrons can be established via the Compton effect. Zel'dovich and Levich[\cite=zel], using the kinetic equation of Kompaneets, have shown that in the absence of absorption the photons undergo BEC. Recently it was disclosed that exists an another mechanism of the creation of equilibrium state and BEC in a nonideal dense photon gas[\cite=ltsin02]. More importantly a new effect was predicted in the same paper, namely that the inhomogeneous dense photon gas can be found in the intermediate state. In the present paper, we consider the BEC and evaporation of the transverse photons (photons) from the Bose condensate. In our study we assume that the intensity of radiation is sufficiently large, so that the photon-photon interaction is more likely than the photon-electron interaction. In the case when the variation of the plasma density can be neglected in comparison with the variation of the photon density, the elementary excitations represent the longitudinal photons (photonikos), for which we will derive the well known Bogoliubov's energy spectrum.

Basic equations and Stability of photon flow

We have shown in Ref.[\cite=ltsin96] that the behavior of photons in a plasma is radically different from the one in a vacuum. Namely, plasma particles perform oscillatory motion in the field of EM waves affecting the radiation field. The oscillation of electrons in an isotropic homogeneous plasma leads to the index of refraction, which depends on the frequency of the radiation, and is not close to unity for a dense plasma, i.e.

[formula]

where [formula] for an electron-ion plasma (neglecting the ion contribution) and [formula] for an electron-positron plasma (- e,m0e, n0e and γ are electron charge, the rest mass, density and the relativistic gamma factor of the electrons respectively).

Rewriting Eq.([\ref=refr]) in terms of an energy ε  =  ω and momentum p =  (where [formula] is the Planck constant divided by 2π) and introducing mγ  =  ωp / c2, we obtain the expression of energy for a single photon

[formula]

which is expressed through the standard formula for the energy transport velocity

[formula]

For the momentum of photon we can write

[formula]

The form of Eq.([\ref=ener]) coincides with the expression for the total relativistic energy of massive particles, so that the rest mass mγ is associated with the photon in a plasma. We note here that in contrast to material particles, the rest mass of photons depends on the plasma density. In view of this analogy between a photon in a plasma and a free material particle, we can treat the photon gas being with the plasma as a neutral subsystem of particles that have non-zero rest mass.

In the following we will show that under certain conditions the photon-photon interactions dominate the photon-plasma particle interactions. In this case, we may consider the medium to consist of two weakly interacting subsystems: the photon gas and the plasma, which slowly exchange energy between each other. In photon-photon interaction the phases of the waves are, in general, random functions of time. Hence, we can average over them. In such a situation the perturbation state of the photon gas can be described in terms of the occupation number [formula] of photons, which is the slowly varying function in space and time. Recently, a new version of kinetic equation for the occupation number of photons, for modes propagating with the wavevector [formula] and the frequency ω, at the position [formula] and time t, was derived in Refs.[\cite=ltsin98],[\cite=ntsin98],[\cite=men]. This equation reads

[formula]

where [formula], ne and n0e are the non-equilibrium and equilibrium densities of the electrons, respectively, and γ can be expressed as

[formula]

where [formula].

Equation ([\ref=kin]) represents the generalization of the Wigner-Moyal equation (WME) for the classical EM field. It should be emphasized that from this equation follows conservation of the total number of photons, but not the momentum and energy of photons, i.e.,

[formula]

where coefficient 2 denotes two possible polarization of the photons. Hence, the chemical potential, μγ, of the photon gas is not zero.

If the local frequency ω and wavevector [formula] are related by the dispersion equation, ω  =  ω(k), then the occupation number is represented as [formula] and Eq.([\ref=kin]) reduces to

[formula]

In the geometric optics approximation (sinx  ≈  x), Eq.([\ref=kin]) reduces to the one-particle Liouville-Vlasov equation with an additional term

[formula]

It is important to emphasize that in Eqs.([\ref=kin]), ([\ref=kinom]), ([\ref=liou]) there are two forces of distinct nature, which can change the occupation number of photons. One force appears due to the redistribution of electrons in space, [formula], and time, [formula]. The other force arises by the variation of the shape of wavepacket. In other words, this force originates from the alteration of the average kinetic energy of the electron oscillating in a rapidly varying field of EM waves, and is proportional to [formula] and [formula]. Clearly, in the case when the density of plasma does not (or almost does not) change, remains only the force due to the variation of the shape of wavepacket. So that in the relativistic case the variation of the intensity of EM waves leads to the effects as self-modulation, self-focusing, formation of shock waves, etc.

We now consider the propagation of small perturbations in a homogeneous photon flux-plasma medium assuming the temperature of electrons to be nonrelativistic, i.e., Te  ≪  m0ec2γ. We linearize equations of motion and continuity of electrons with respect to perturbations, and seek plane wave solutions proportional to [formula]. Here we consider the range of low frequencies for which the inequalities Ω < qc < ωpe are fulfilled. In this case the photon flow can no longer excite the Langmiur plasma waves, and the contribution of perturbation of the electron density is rather small in comparison to perturbation of the photon density as

[formula]

Therefore, in our consideration the density of the plasma particles remain constant. In this case Eqs. ([\ref=kin]) and ([\ref=kinom]) contain the variation of the relativistic γ factor alone.

We next demonstrate a new phenomena in the photon gas, which originates from the variation of shape of the wavepacket. Obviously, any waves, which can arise in the photon gas-plasma medium in this case, are the proper waves with the weak decrement of the photon gas. To this end, we linearize Eq.([\ref=kinom]) with respect to the perturbation, which is represented as [formula] The result is

[formula]

or after summation we obtain

[formula]

where [formula] After integration over all wavevectors [formula], from Eq.([\ref=sumkin]) we get the dispersion relation due to the relativistic selfmodulation

[formula]

which has, in general, complex roots. In Eq.([\ref=self]) N0(k) is the occupation number in the equilibrium state and is represented as

[formula]

This is a spectral Gaussian distribution, with the average wavevector [formula] and the spectral width σk.

We can rewrite Eq.([\ref=self]) in another form, taking into account a pole in the integral [formula] where [formula]. Using the well known relation

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the prescription that at the singularity x = 0 the principal value is to be taken, Eq.([\ref=self]) is rewritten in the form

[formula]

In the first and the third integrals we now replace the wavevector [formula] by [formula], and in the second and the forth integrals [formula]. Assuming that [formula], |q|, [formula], after integration we obtain the dispersion relation

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula] [formula], [formula], and the velocity [formula] can be treated as the sound velocity of longitudinal photons, similar to phonons in quantum liquid at almost zero temperature[\cite=lif].

We now neglect the small imaginary term in Eq.([\ref=disp]), and examine the following equation

[formula]

This equation has a complex solutions, when the inequality V2E > V2s  +  α2q2 , for [formula], holds. The unstable solution can be written as [formula], where

[formula]

and the growth rate for the unstable modes is

[formula]

This instability at Vs  =  α = 0 was disclosed in Ref.[\cite=ntsin98].

If [formula], then the solution ([\ref=reom]) clearly describes the emission of photonikos by the bunch of photons inside a resonance cone [formula], similar to the well known Cherenkov emission of EM waves by a charged particles. In addition, here is an analogy with the Landau criterion about the creation of elementary excitations.

We now consider the case, when V2s > V2E or ω2p(γ20 - 1) < 6γ30σ2kc2. If we write Eq.([\ref=ditdis]) in the moving frame ([formula]), and multiply the both sides by [formula], then we obtain the well known Bogoliubov energy spectrum

[formula]

where ε  =  Ω, p = , and meff  =  ω / c2. This equation has the same form as the energy of the elementary excitations in the quantum liquid at zero temperature.

For small momentum [formula] from Eq.([\ref=bogol]) follows ε = pV  ≈  Vsp. This expression reveals that the coefficient V is the velocity of "sound" in the photon gas, similar to phonons in the quantum medium. For the large momentum (p  ≫  meffV), the photoniko energy ([\ref=bogol]) tends to p2 / 2meff, i.e., the kinetic energy of an individual photoniko.

The decrement, [formula], of photoniko is derived from Eq.([\ref=disp]), which is

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] We note that the decrement has a maximum near the frequency of the Cherenkov resonance Ω≃qu cos Θ.

In the above we have derived the condition ([\ref=deltarel]), which implies that the density of plasma almost does not change. In this case from Eq.([\ref=kin]) follows that photons with different frequencies and wavevectors scatter on the photon bunch, and the equilibrium state may be established. This is a new phenomena of the "Compton" scattering type, i.e., the statistical equilibrium between the photons and the photon bunch will establish itself as a result of the scattering processes. To better exhibit this, we derive the Pauli equation in the wavevector representation. Note that the Wigner-Moyal-Tsintsadze equation (WMTE) ([\ref=kin]) is convenient for a study of non-linear processes in the photon gas in the case of so-called weak turbulence states. Such states of the photon gas-plasma means that the energy of the quasi-particle (photoniko) is small compared to the photon energies. In the case of weak-turbulence, we can define the distribution function [formula] in any approximation for the amplitude of perturbation by iterating the WMTE. The result is

[formula]

Here we have introduced the scattering rate

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=fineq]) describes the three wave interaction. Namely, the photon passing through the photon bunch absorbs and emits photonikos, with frequencies [formula] and wavevectors [formula]. Integral in Eq.([\ref=fineq]) is the elastic collision integral and describes the photon scattering process on the variation of shape of the photon bunch.

It should be emphasized that the kinetic equation ([\ref=fineq]) is a new version of the Pauli equation in the wavevector representation [\cite=pau]. Note that the equation type of ([\ref=fineq]) has been obtained by Pauli for a quantum system, whereas Eq.([\ref=fineq]), derived for the dense photon gas, is pure classical. This equation indicates that the equilibrium of the photon gas is triggered by the perturbation δρ  =  δ(n/noγ), in particular by the perturbation in the wavepacket.

Bose-Einstein condensation in the photon gas

It is well known from plasma physics that the transverse photon can decay into the transverse photon and a plasmon (electron Langmuir and ion sound plasmons). For this process to take place it is necessary to have a fluctuation of the plasma density. In our consideration, as was shown in Sec. 2, the density of plasma remains constant. So that only one mechanism (relativistic effect), which can cause BEC, is the decay of the transverse photon into the transverse and the longitudinal photons. Namely, the photon ([formula] generates photoniko and scatters on latter, with the frequency [formula] and the wavevector [formula]. In this case, the wave number and frequency matching conditions are satisfied, i.e., [formula], and [formula]. These processes continue as a cascade [formula], etc.) till the wavevector of the photon becomes zero and the frequency ω  =  ωp  /  γ1 / 2. This cascade leads to the BEC of the photons and the creation of the photoniko gas. When the density of latter is sufficiently small, the photonikos may be regarded as non-interacting with each other, however they can exchange energies and momentum with a bunch of the photons by scattering mechanism, and finally such process can lead to the equilibrium state of the photoniko gas, with the Bose distribution

[formula]

where Ω is the Bogoliubov spectrum ([\ref=bogol]). We note here that since the total number of photonikos does not conserve, the chemical potential of this gas is zero. The result of BEC is that the ground state is filled by photons with the total rest energy [formula], where N0 is the total number of photons in the ground state. We can express explicitly the energy of the ground state, E0, through the total number and the volume of the photon gas in two limits. First, we consider ultrarelativistic case, when γ  ≈  Q1 / 2 = ( / m0c2)2 / 3(N0 / N0e)2 / 3(1 / V1 / 3), where  = (4πe2N0e / m0e)1 / 2, N0e is the total number of electrons.

The chemical potential of the photon gas is

[formula]

Note that in quantum Bose liquid at T = 0, the chemical potential increases with increase of N0, whereas in the present case μ decreases as shows Eq.([\ref=chempo]).

We now find the pressure in the condensate as Pc =  - ∂E0  /  ∂V, and write the equation of state for given N0, the result is

[formula]

Next in the nonrelativistic limit, we have γ≃1 + (1 / 2)( / m0c2)(N0 / N0e)(1 / V1 / 2). Then for the equation of state and the chemical potential we get the following expressions

[formula]

[formula]

Note that the second term in Eq.([\ref=chemponon]) is always less than one.

The kinetic equation ([\ref=fineq]) is the simplest nonequilibrium model in which we can expect BEC. To show this, we introduce the number density of photons in the condensate as [formula]. Then we can write [formula], which means that the photons with a zero wavevector are in the condensate.

We now discuss an another situation in which the photon with the wavevector [formula] is collided with the photoniko with [formula]. For such processes exists the probability of the condition [formula] to be satisfied. Thus the photons absorbing the photoniko will pass to the ground state. Therefore, the occupation number, which is under integral in Eq.([\ref=fineq]), can be written as

[formula]

where n1(t) is the density of pairs, for which the equality [formula] holds. Substituting Eq.([\ref=ocnum]) into Eq.([\ref=fineq]), for the Bose-Einstein condensate density n0(t) we obtain

[formula]

where [formula] and in the last term we have replaced [formula]. We specifically note here that the first and the third terms in Eq.([\ref=dencon]) are the sources of production of the Bose-Einstein condensate, whereas the second term describes the evaporation of photons from the ground state. It is clear from Eq.([\ref=dencon]) that the stationary solution may exist, and it is

[formula]

where [formula] with [formula].

The problem of BEC and evaporation of the Bose-Einstein condensate we can investigate by Fokker-Planck equation (FPE), which we derive from the Pauli equation. Here we suppose that the wavevector [formula] and the frequency Ω of photonikos are small in comparison with the [formula] and ω. This allows us to use the following expansion in the integrand

[formula]

Substituting this expression into Eq.([\ref=fineq]), we obtain the FPE for photons, which describes the slow change of the occupation number in the wavevector space

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

The quantity [formula] is the dynamic friction coefficient, whereas [formula] is the diffusion tensor in the wavevector space. Introducing the following definition [formula], and noting that the expression on RHS in Eq.([\ref=fp]) is divergent in wavevector space, Eq.([\ref=fp]) can be rewritten as

[formula]

where [formula] is the photon flux density in wavevector space. The fact that the flux should be zero allowed us to express [formula] and [formula] in terms of one another. The equilibrium distribution function we choose to be Gaussian

[formula]

Substituting expression ([\ref=gaus]) into the equation [formula], we obtain [formula] Finally the transport equation of the photon gas takes the form

[formula]

In order to solve Eq.([\ref=trans]), we consider a simple model representing the diffusion tensor as [formula], with D0 = const. Such situation is realized when u  ·   cos Θ  ≪  qc2  /  ω. With this assumption Eq.([\ref=trans]) reduces to

[formula]

where [formula]. We first neglect the diffusion term in Eq.([\ref=simtr]), and assuming [formula], we get for f = kN

[formula]

The general solution of this equation is an arbitrary function of k0 = keat (where k0 is the initial value of the wavevector), i.e., f(k0) = f(keat). This function is constant on the curves k0 = keat, while at t  →    ∞   the wavevector goes to zero (k  →  0). The meaning of this is that the occupation number would tend to peak toward the origin as

[formula]

Thus we conclude that the friction effect leads to BEC of the photon gas. Here the condensate formation time, tc, is defined by the relation atc  ~  1. It should be emphasized that the exponential decay of the wavevector k = k0e- at is due to the linearity of the FPE. The presence of nonlinearity could saturate the exponential growth of N(k,t).

Second, we suppose that [formula] is the even function with respect to [formula]. In this case A = 0, and we have

[formula]

Assuming that initially all photons are in the ground state with k = 0, and the occupation number of the photons is [formula], then the solution of Eq.([\ref=even]) reads

[formula]

In the course of time, the number of photons with k = 0 decreases as t- 1 / 2. The number of photons in the surrounding wavevector space rises correspondingly, and initially peaked at the origin is to be flatten out. Let us determine the mean square wavevector from origin at time t. From expression ([\ref=solev]) we have

[formula]

Thus, [formula] increases as the square root of time. Eqs. ([\ref=solev]) and ([\ref=sqr]) manifest that the evaporation of photons from the condensate takes place.

We now derive a relation between the diffusion time, tD, and the time of the condensation. From Eqs.([\ref=orig]) and ([\ref=solev]) we obtain

[formula]

where [formula], as follows from the Wigner function [formula]. Note that r0 is the initial cross size of the photon bunch. Finally, we arrive at the desired relation

[formula]

From here it is evident that for the condensation and evaporation of photons, it is necessary that the following inequality tD  ≫  tc is satisfied. This is to be expected, as in realistic astrophysical objects with a strong radiation, as well as in laboratory experiments with a laser radiation, the following condition k2r20  ≫  1 is valid.

Formation of shock waves

We now consider 3D problem of the nonlinear stage of evolution of the photon bunch, revealing the shock formation. From the kinetic equation ([\ref=liou]) one can obtain a set of fluid equations by the usual way. These equations of motion and Q of the photon gas are:

[formula]

[formula]

where uγ is the photon mean velocity.

We have carried out 3D numerical simulation that self-consistently solves the above fluid equations. We first discuss numerical analysis for pancake-shaped photon beams, i.e., x0 = y0 = 2, and z0 = 0.5. The propagation direction is taken to be in the z-direction, and Q0 = 8. Figures 1a and 1b show that the width of the beam becomes shorter in time along the propagation direction. The photons are concentrated in the small region (on the z-axis), and at t=1.8 starts to form the shock wave. Whereas, Figures 1c and 1d show the insignificant expansion of the beam in the transverse direction.

Rather different processes develop when the initially the photon beam has a form of the bullet, i.e., when x0 = y0 = 0.5, z0 = 2, and Q0 = 8. Namely, as can be seen from Figures 2a and 2b, the beam elongates in time along the propagation direction. Whereas, the compression of the beam in the transverse direction is observed in Figures 2c and 2d, and the shock wave takes place at t=1.6, in a time short compared to the previous case.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

We have investigated the interaction of spectrally broad and relativistically intense EM radiation with a plasma in the case when the photon-photon interaction dominates the photon-particle interactions. We have established the condition under which the variation of the plasma density can be neglected in comparison with the variation of the photon density. In such case the elementary excitations represent the photonikos, for which we have derived the well known Bogoliubov energy spectrum. We have studied the BEC and evaporation of the photons from the Bose condensate. To this end, from the WMTE we have derived the Pauli kinetic equation for the photon gas. We have also derived the FPE, and presented a simple model, which exhibits the possibility of the creation of Bose-Einstein condensate and evaporation of photons from the condensate. The theory developed in this paper is of essential interest to study an extremely complex phenomena of astrophysics in laboratories using ultra-intense lasers. It should also be the case for a black hole. In this connection we speculate that the recently observed radiation from the black hole may be attributed to the evaporated photons from the Bose condensate. That is initially all photons fall into Bose-Einstein condensate, and then after a certain time, as discussed in this paper, some photons undergo evaporation from the condensate.
