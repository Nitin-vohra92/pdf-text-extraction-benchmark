Generalized Electromagnetic Fields of Dyons in Isotropic Medium

Few interest in the subject of monopoles and dyons was enhanced by the work of t' Hooft [\cite=key-1] and Polyakov [\cite=key-2] and its extension by Julia and Zee [\cite=key-3]. Consequently, these particles became intrinsic part of all current grand unified theories [\cite=key-4] [\cite=key-5] in view of their enormous potential importance [\cite=key-6] [\cite=key-7] [\cite=key-8] [\cite=key-9]. Keeping in view the potential importance of monopoles and the results of Witten [\cite=key-9] that monopoles are necessarily dyons, we [\cite=key-10] [\cite=key-11] have also constructed a self-consistent co-variant theory of generalized electromagnetic fields associated with dyons each carrying the generalized charge as complex quantity with its real and imaginary part as electric and magnetic constituents. On the other hand Kravchenko [\cite=key-12] has analysed the Maxwell's equations for time-dependent electromagnetic fields in homogeneous (isotropic) and chiral medium. In this paper we have derived the various quantum equations of generalized electrmagnetic fields of dyons (particles carrying simultaneously electric and magnetic charges) in isotropic medium in consistent and manifest co-variant ways. It has been shown that the present theory of dyons remains invariant under the duality transformations in isotropic homogeneous medium. It has also been shown that the equation of motion in isotropic medium reproduces the rotationally symmetric gauge invariant angular momentum of dyons and accordingly we have derived the quantization condition for generalised electromagnetic fields of dyons in isotropic medium.

Let us start with the symmetrized Maxwell's equations, derived by Dirac [\cite=key-13] in presence of magnetic charge (monopole) to establish the dual invariance between electric and magnetic fields, in the following manner in vacuum in SI units [\cite=key-14] for c = i.e.

[formula]

where ρe and ρm are respectively the electric and magnetic charge densities while [formula] and [formula] are the corresponding current densities, [formula] is electric induction vector, [formula] is electric field, [formula] is magnetic induction vector and [formula] is magnetic field. Here we assume the homogeneous (isotropic) medium with the following definitions [\cite=key-15],

[formula]

and

[formula]

where εo the free space permitivity, μo is the permeability of free space and εr and μr are defined respectively as relative permitivity and permeability in electric and magnetic fields. On using equations ([\ref=eq:5]) and ([\ref=eq:6]), equations ( [\ref=eq:1]- [\ref=eq:4]) take the following differential form,

[formula]

Differential equations ([\ref=eq:7],[\ref=eq:8],[\ref=eq:9],[\ref=eq:10]) are referred as the generalised field equations of dyons in homogeneous medium and the electric and magnetic fields are corresponding called generalised electromagnetic fields of dyons. These electric and magnetic fields of dyons are expressed in following differential form in homogeneous medium in terms of two potentials [\cite=key-11]as,

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are the two four-potentials associated with electric and magnetic charges. Substituting the values of [formula] and [formula] in ([\ref=eq:9]) and ([\ref=eq:10]), we get the following sets of wave equation for dyons in isotropic medium

[formula]

along with

[formula]

where we have imposed the following subsidiary conditions

[formula]

and

[formula]

and used the relations [formula]or [formula] with [formula] is the velocity of light in free space (vacuum) and v is considered as the speed of electromagnetic wave in homogeneous (isotropic) medium. As such, we may write the following tensorial representation of generalised Maxwell's -Dirac (GDM) equations of dyons in homogeneous medium i.e.

[formula]

where we have used the definition [\cite=key-11] of Fμνand Fdμνas

[formula]

Generalized electromagnetic fields of dyons in homogeneous medium are thus directly be obtained from field tensor Fμνand Fdμνas

[formula]

Equations ([\ref=eq:11]) and ([\ref=eq:12]) are symmetrically invariant under the following transformations

[formula]

[formula]

Equations([\ref=eq:19]) and ([\ref=eq:20]) are also invariant under the generalized continuous linear transformations [\cite=key-16]

[formula]

which reduces to equations ([\ref=eq:31] and [\ref=eq:32] ) for [formula] and thus recalled as duality transformations. Similarly equations ( [\ref=eq:33] to [\ref=eq:42] ) are also expressed as duality transformations between electric and magnetic constituents of dyons. As such the GDM equations given by equations ( [\ref=eq:7] to [\ref=eq:10] ) are thus referred as manifestly covariant and dual invariant field equations of dyons moving in isotropic homogeneus medim. Defining the complex vector field [formula]in the following form,

[formula]

and using equations ([\ref=eq:11],[\ref=eq:12] and [\ref=eq:45]) we get the following relations between generalized field [formula] and the components of complex four-potential as

[formula]

where {Vμ} is the generalized four-potential of dyons in homogeneous medium and defined as

[formula]

i.e.

[formula]

and

[formula]

Maxwell's field equation ([\ref=eq:7],[\ref=eq:8],[\ref=eq:9],and [\ref=eq:10]) may then be written in terms of generalized field [formula] as

[formula]

where ρand [formula] are the generalized charge and current source densities of dyons in homogeneous medium described as

[formula]

Taking the curl of equation ([\ref=eq:51]) and using equation ([\ref=eq:50]) we obtain the new parameter (called [formula]) expressed in the following form in terms of source densities i.e.

[formula]

where [formula]is the D'Alembertian operator and defined as

[formula]

Maxwell's-Dirac equation ([\ref=eq:7],[\ref=eq:8],[\ref=eq:9],and [\ref=eq:10]) may now be expressed in the following manner to establish the relation between generalized potential and current components of dyons i.e.

[formula]

Defining the generalized field tensor of dyon as

[formula]

One can directly obtain the following generalized field equation of dyon in homogeneous (isotropic) medium i.e.

[formula]

The suitable manifestly co variant Lagrangian density, which yields the field equations ([\ref=eq:1],[\ref=eq:2],[\ref=eq:3],[\ref=eq:4]) under the variation of field parameters i.e. potential only without changing the trajectory of particle may be written as follows,

[formula]

where m0is the rest mass of particle and * denotes the complex conjugate. Lagrangian density given by equation ([\ref=eq:61]) directly follows the following manifestly covariant and dual invariant form of Lorentz four-force equation of motion for dyons in homogeneous (isotropic) medium as

[formula]

where Re denotes the real part, [formula]is the four-acceleration and [formula] is the four-velocity of the particle and q is the generalized charge of dyon defined as follows in isotropic medium as,

[formula]

Equations ([\ref=eq:19]),([\ref=eq:20]) and ([\ref=eq:59],[\ref=eq:60]) are invariant under duality transformations,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Hence the the generalized charge of dyon given by equation ([\ref=eq:63]) may be written as

[formula]

In addition of the dual symmetry the field equations ([\ref=eq:59],[\ref=eq:60]), the equation of motion ([\ref=eq:62]) and the Lagrangian density ([\ref=eq:61]) lead to the following symmetries [\cite=key-10];

Invariance under a pure rotation in charge space or its combination with transformation containing simultaneously space and time reflection (strong symmetry);

A weak symmetry under charge reflection combined with space reflection or time reflection (not both);

A weak symmetry under PT (combined operation of parity and time reversal) and strong symmetry under CPT ( combined operation of charge conjugation, parity and time reversal).

Using equation ([\ref=eq:67]) the interaction of ithdyon with the field of jthdyon in isotropic medium may be written as follows from the interaction part i.e. the V*μjμpart of Lagrangian density given by equation ([\ref=eq:61]), i.e.

[formula]

where C(j)μis the electric four-potential describing the field of jthdyon, ejis the electric charge and u(i)μis the four-velocity of ithdyon in the field of jthdyon. This equation shows that

Interaction between two dyon is zero when their generalized charges are orthogonal in their combined charge space.

Interaction depends on electric coupling parameter

[formula]

under the constancy condition [formula]

3. Interaction depends on magnetic coupling parameter (i.e. chirality)

[formula]

under the condition [formula]

In the isotropic (homogeneous) medium the dual invariant energy density of dyon is now expressed as

[formula]

In equation ([\ref=eq:1],[\ref=eq:2],[\ref=eq:3],[\ref=eq:4]) and ([\ref=eq:5],[\ref=eq:6]) the generalized Maxwell's equations are considered together with the so called constitutive relations described in terms of the relations between the induction vector and field vector. The constitutive relation given by equations ([\ref=eq:5],[\ref=eq:6]) then describe the rich variety of physical phenomenon representing the properties and responses of the medium and to the application of generalized electromagnetic field of dyons. The field equation, Lagrangian and the equation of motion of dyons described here in isotropic medium are also considered as Poincare and conformal invariant, but there is no trivial gauge group of invariance transformations. Dyonic fields given by equations ([\ref=eq:19],[\ref=eq:20]),([\ref=eq:56],[\ref=eq:57]),([\ref=eq:59],[\ref=eq:60]) and ([\ref=eq:62]) are manifestly covariant and also invariant under duality transformations. Here we have described the electromagnetic characteristic of dyon field equations in terms of the parameters of the medium ε and μ which do not change in time. Thus our results corresponding to the generalized electromagnetic models of dyons are represented in terms of time-harmonic (monochromatic) fields in a consistent and unique manner and reproduces the theories of the dynamics of electric (magnetic) charge in the absence of magnetic (electric) charges or vice versa.
