Boundary behaviors and scalar curvature of compact manifolds

Introduction

In [\cite=ST], the authors proved the following: Let (Ω,g) be a compact manifold of dimension three with smooth boundary Σ which has positive Gaussian curvature and has positive mean curvature. Suppose Ω has nonnegative scalar curvature, then for each boundary component Σi of Σ satisfies,

[formula]

where Hi0 is the mean curvature of Σi with respect to the outward normal when it is isometrically embedded in [formula], dΣi is the volume form on Σi induced from g. Moreover, if equality holds for some Σi then Σ has only one component and Ω is a domain in [formula].

The result gives restriction on a convex surface Σ in [formula] which can bound a compact manifold with nonnegative scalar curvature such that the mean curvature of Σ is positive. It is interesting to see what one can say for convex surface Σ in [formula], the hyperbolic space with constant curvature -  κ2.

The result mentioned above has other interpretation. It implies the quasi-local mass introduced by Brown-York [\cite=BY1] [\cite=BY2] is positive under the condition that the boundary has positive Gaussian curvature. In [\cite=LY1], [\cite=LY2], Liu and Yau introduced a quasi-local mass in spacetime. This quasi-local mass were also introduced by Epp [\cite=E] and Kijoswki [\cite=K]. More importantly, Liu and Yau proved its positivity, using [\cite=ST]. A recent definition of quasi-local mass that relates with these works please see [\cite=Z].

Motivated by [\cite=ST] [\cite=LY1] [\cite=LY2], in a recent work [\cite=WY] Wang and Yau proves the following: Suppose (Ω,g) is a three dimensional manifold with smooth boundary Σ with positive mean curvature H, which is a topological sphere. Suppose the scalar curvature R of Ω satisfies R  ≥   - 6κ2 and the Gaussian curvature of Σ is larger than -  κ2, then there is a future directed time-like vector value function [formula] on Σ such that

[formula]

is time-like. Here H0 is the mean curvature of Σ when isometrically embedded in [formula], which is in turns isometrically embedded in [formula], the Minkowski space. In this result, the vector [formula] is not very explicit because it is obtained by solving a backward parabolic equation by prescribing data at infinity.

In this work, by modifying the argument in [\cite=WY], we get similar result by replacing [formula] by [formula] for some α > 1 depending only on the intrinsic geometry of Σ. Here (x1,x2,x3,t) is the future directed unit normal vector of [formula] in [formula]. See Theorem [\ref=positivity2] for a more precise statement. We believe that the same result should be true with [formula], but we cannot prove it for the time being.

As a consequence, if o is a point inside of Σ in [formula], then

[formula]

where r is the distance function from o in [formula]. Moreover, equality holds if and only if (Ω,g) is a domain in [formula]. The results can be considered as generalization of the results in [\cite=ST]. In fact, if we let [formula], we may obtain the inequality ([\ref=Brown-Yorkmass]).

The paper is organized as follows. In , we list some facts that we need, most of them are from [\cite=WY]. In , we prove our main results. We will also give some examples that α in Theorem [\ref=positivity2] can be taken to be 1 and also study some properties of [formula].

Preliminary

Most materials in this section are from Wang and Yau [\cite=WY]. Let (Ω,g) be a compact manifold with smooth boundary so that Σ  =  ∂Ω is a topologically sphere. Let H be the mean curvature with respect to the outward normal and K be the Gaussian curvature of Σ and let R be the scalar curvature of Ω. In our convention, the mean curvature of the unit sphere in [formula] with respect to the outward normal is 2. By [\cite=P1] [\cite=CW], we have the following:

Suppose the Gaussian curvature K of Σ satisfies K >   -  κ2. Then Σ can be isometrically embedded into the hyperbolic space [formula] with constant curvature -  κ2 as a convex surface which bounds a convex domain D in [formula]. Moreover, the embedding is unique up to an isometry of [formula].

Since Σ is a topological sphere, its image Σ0 under the embedding divides [formula] into two components, the exterior and the interior of Σ0. Let [formula] be the unit outward normal of Σ0. It is said to be convex if the second fundamental form [formula] is positive definite for X and Y tangent to Σ0, where [formula] is the covariant derivative of [formula]. The interior D of Σ0 being convex means that D is geodesically convex.

The existence and uniqueness of the embedding were proved by Pogorelov [\cite=P1]. The convexity of Σ0 and D were proved by do Carmo and Warner [\cite=CW].

Further identify [formula] with

[formula]

where [formula] is the Minkowski space consisting of [formula] with the Lorentz metric dx21 + dx22 + dx23 - dt2. Position vectors in [formula] can be parametrized as

[formula]

The metric of [formula] is then

[formula]

Note that r is the geodesic distance of a point from [formula].

Let Σρ be the level surface outside Σ0 in [formula] with distance ρ from Σ0. Foliate [formula] by Σρ, [formula]. The hyperbolic metric can be written as [formula], where gρ is the induced metric on Σρ.

Suppose f [formula] is the embedding with unit outward normal [formula]. Then Σρ as a subset of [formula] is given by

[formula]

Here for simplicity, (p,ρ) denotes a point Σρ which lies on the geodesic from the point p∈Σ0 and [formula].

Suppose in addition that the mean curvature of H of Σ with respect to (Ω,g) is positive and the scalar curvature R of Ω is greater than or equal to - 6κ2. Wang and Yau [\cite=WY] are able to solve the following parabolic equation

[formula]

for all [formula] with positive and bounded solution u. Here Δρ is the Laplacian operator of Σρ, Rρ is scalar curvature of Σρ, and H0 is the mean curvature of Σρ which is positive. We need the following result which is proved by Wang and Yau, see Theorem 6.1 and Corollary 6.1 in [\cite=WY].

We also have the following rigidity result.

With the same assumptions and notations as in Theorem [\ref=positivemass]. Suppose

[formula]

for some future directed null vector ζ in [formula], where the inner product is given by the Lorentz metric. Then Ω is a domain in [formula].

For simplicity, let us assume that κ = 1. As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=positivemass] in [\cite=WY], let ds2 = u2dρ2 + gρ be the quasi-spherical metric where u is the solution of ([\ref=parabolicequation]). Let (M,) be the manifold by gluing (Ω,g) with [formula] with metric ds2. By [\cite=WY], if ([\ref=rigidity1]) is true, then the manifold (M,) has a Killing spinor φ which is nontrivial, smooth away from Σ and is continuous. More precisely, φ satisfies:

[formula]

where c(V)  ·   is the Clifford multiplication. Hence [formula] is Einstein. Since M has dimension three, the sectional curvature is - 1 in [formula], see [\cite=B], for example. Let h0ij and hij be the second fundamental form of Σ0 with respect to the metrics [formula] and ds2 respectively. Then hij = u- 1h0ij. By the Gauss equation and the fact that both [formula] and ds2 have constant curvature - 1, [formula].

On the other hand, φ is not zero on Σ0 and so φ is a nontrivial Killing spinor in (Ω,g) satisfying ([\ref=spinoreq]) and g has constant curvature - 1 as before.

We claim that the second fundamental forms of Σ0 with respect to g and [formula] are equal. If this is true, then by the proof of [\cite=ST], we can conclude that [formula] is smooth. From this it is easy to see that [formula].

Let us prove the claim. Since Σ0 is a topological sphere, for some a > 0 a tubular neighborhood of Σ0  ×  (0,a) in (Ω,g) is simply connected. Since it has constant curvature - 1, (Σ0  ×  (0,a),g) can be isometrically embedded in [formula], see [\cite=Sp]. Denote the embedding by ι = (u1,u2,u3) where (u1,u2,u3) is are global coordinates in [formula]. Since ι is an isometry, the normal curvatures of Σ0  ×  {τ} for 0 < τ < a with respect to g and the hyperbolic metric are equal. Hence they are uniformly bounded on Σ0  ×  (0,a). Note that Σ0 is convex in [formula], so Σ0  ×  {τ} is also convex when embedded in [formula], for 0 < τ < a provided a is small. By [\cite=P2], for any [formula], [formula] are uniformly bounded on Σ0  ×  (0,a), where [formula] is the covariant derivatives of Σ0  ×  {τ} with induced metric by g. Hence by taking a subsequence of [formula], we obtain an isometric embedding of (Σ,g). In this embedding the second fundamental form with respect to g and [formula] are equal. Since the embedding of Σ is unique up to an isometry of [formula], the claim is true.

Main results

Let (Ω,g) be as in Theorem [\ref=positivemass] and let ∂Ω  =  Σ. With the same notations as in the theorem, suppose o = (0,0,0,1 / κ) is in D which is the interior of Σ in [formula]. Let Σ0 be the image of Σ under the embedding described in . H0 is the mean curvature of Σ0 in [formula]. We also identify Σ with Σ0. Let Bo(R1) and Bo(R2) be geodesic balls in [formula] such that Bo(R1)  ⊂  D  ⊂  Bo(R2).

We want to prove the following:

In ([\ref=positionvector]), the position vector in [formula] is given by

[formula]

where (φ1,φ2,φ3) denote position vectors of points of [formula] in [formula]. Let {Σρ} be the foliation of [formula] described in . We need the following:

With the same assumptions and notations as in Theorem [\ref=positivity2], let [formula] with [formula], the following are true.

For any ρ > 0,

[formula]

If [formula], then for ρ > 0

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

where

[formula]

(i) Recall that o = (0,0,0,1 / κ)∈D and r is the geodesic distance in [formula] from o. D is geodesically convex by Lemma [\ref=embedding1]. For any [formula], denote the geodesic from x to y parametrized by arc length by [formula].

Let p∈Σ and let γ(ρ) be the geodesic through p so that γ(ρ) is orthogonal to Σ at p with arc length parametrization. Moreover, γ(0) = p and γ(ρ) is outside Σ for ρ > 0. Let q be the point on γ such that d(o,q) = d(o,γ). Then q = γ(ρ1) with ρ1 < 0 because D is geodesically convex. Since [formula], [formula] is nondecreasing on ρ > 0 along γ and [formula] at p. Let [formula] and let η be the geodesic from p on the totally geodesic [formula] containing γ and β such that η is tangent to Σ0. Let x,y be the intersection of η with ∂Bo(R2). Then [formula] where φ is the angle between [formula] and [formula]. Since η is outside Bo(R1) so

[formula]

Hence we have

[formula]

on [formula].

(ii) Since the inner product in [formula] of (y1,y2,y3) and (φ1,φ2,φ3) is φ, we may assume that φ  =   cos θ in ([\ref=positionvector]). The hyperbolic metric outside D is given by

[formula]

Compute [formula] in the above two forms of [formula], we have

[formula]

Since φ  =   cos θ, (ii) follows.

The last assertion follows from (i), (ii), the fact that [formula] and the fact that r  ≥  R1 for ρ  ≥  0.

With the same assumptions and notations as in Theorem [\ref=positivity2],

[formula]

in [formula].

In the representation of [formula] in ([\ref=positionvector1]), the Laplacian of [formula] is given by

[formula]

So [formula]. In the foliation ([\ref=embedding2]), the metric of [formula] is given by dρ2 + gρ where gρ is the induced metric on level surface Σρ. The Laplacian on [formula] is given by

[formula]

Using ([\ref=embedding2]), we have

[formula]

From this the result follows.

Now we are ready to prove Theorem [\ref=positivity2].

By [\cite=WY] and Lemma [\ref=coordinatefunction1]

[formula]

Let λa(p,ρ) be the principal curvature of the level surface. Then λa  =  κ tanh κ(μa  +  ρ), κ or κ coth κ(μa  +  ρ) with μa > 0, see [\cite=WY]. Hence H0  =  λ1  +  λ2 and Rρ + 2κ2 = 2λ1λ2. Let W0  =  α cosh κr and W = φ sinh κr where [formula], [formula] and α is the constant in the theorem. Then

[formula]

[formula]

Combining this with by Lemma [\ref=estimates], ([\ref=positionvector1]), ([\ref=monotone4]) and the fact that r > R1 in [formula], we have

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=positivemass] and Corollary [\ref=positivemass1], we conclude that ([\ref=positivity2]) is true.

Suppose equality holds in ([\ref=positivity2]) for some future directed null vector ζ, then using Corollary [\ref=positivemass1], we have

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=rigidity], (Ω,g) is a domain in [formula].

By the proof of Theorem [\ref=positivity1] and the characterization of future directed non space-like vector [\cite=WY], we conclude the first part of the corollary is true. If (Ω,g) is not a domain in [formula], by the rigidity part of the theorem, this vector cannot be zero and cannot be null. Hence it is future directed time-like.

For any fixed ρ0, let ζ be the vector [formula]. By Corollary [\ref=rigidity2] as mentioned above, ζ is a future directed non space-like, note that

[formula]

By Remark [\ref=monotone8], we have

[formula]

We may embed [formula] in [formula] such that o = (0,0,0,1 / κ). The result then follows from Theorem [\ref=positivity1]

Theorem [\ref=positivity2] implies a previous result of the authors [\cite=ST]

This result follows from Theorem [\ref=positivity3] and the following lemma.

With the same assumptions and notations as in Theorem [\ref=Shi-Tam], suppose Hκ is the mean curvature of Σ when it is isometrically embedded in [formula], κ > 0. Then there exists κi  →  0 such that lim i  →    ∞Hκi = H0.

Let [formula] be represented by the metric:

[formula]

defined on x21  +  x22  +  x23 = |x|2  <  κ- 2. We may assume that (Σ,g) is embedded to [formula] with embedding ικ such that p is mapped to the origin, where p is some fixed point. Then it is easy to see that Σ  ⊂  Bκ(0,2d) where d the intrinsic diameter of Σ and Bκ is the geodesic ball with respect to the metric ([\ref=hbmetric]).

Let ικ = (u1,κ,u2,κ,u3,κ) in terms of the global coordinates x1,x2,x3. Since the Gauss curvature of Σ is positive, by [\cite=P2], we conclude that for any k  ≥  0, for 0 < κ  ≤  1 and 1  ≤  j  ≤  3, [formula] are uniformly bounded. There exists [formula] such that ικi together its derivatives converge to an embedding of Σ in the Euclidean space. Using the fact that the embedding of Σ in [formula] is unique, it is easy to see that the lemma is true.

Finally, we would like to give some examples to illustrate that in certain situations, α in Theorem [\ref=positivity2] can be chosen as 1. The proofs of these examples are direct application of Theorem [\ref=positivity2], Corollary [\ref=positivity3] and the representation of [formula] given by ([\ref=positionvector1]).

Let [formula], then it is a smooth function on [formula], and it would be interesting to see some properties of this function. We first have:

Suppose f has a critical point o in the interior of D, and let o = (0,0,0,1 / κ), then for 1  ≤  i  ≤  3,

[formula]

It is easy to see that [formula] is the unit tangential vector of geodesic [formula], hence,

[formula]

Combine this fact and a direct computation, we see that the conclusion is true.

Again by a direct computation we have

Let f be defined as above, then
