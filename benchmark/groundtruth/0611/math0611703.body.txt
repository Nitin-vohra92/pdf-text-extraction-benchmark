Remarks on Ramanujan Function Aq(z)

Introduction

Ramanujan function Aq(z), which is also called q-Airy function in the literature, appears repeatedly in Ramanujan's work starting from the Rogers-Ramanujan identities, where Aq( - 1) and Aq( - q) are expressed as infinite products, [\cite=Andrews1], to properties of and conjectures about its zeros, [\cite=Andrews3] [\cite=Andrews4] [\cite=Hayman] [\cite=Ismail5]. It is called q-Airy function because it appears repeatedly in the Plancherel-Rotach type asymptotics [\cite=Ismail1] [\cite=Ismail6] [\cite=Ismail7] of q-orthogonal polynomials, just like classical Airy function in the classical Plancherel-Rotach asymptotics of classical orthogonal polynomials [formula][\cite=Szego] [\cite=Ismail2]. In our joint work, [\cite=Ismail7], we derived Plancherel-Rotach asymptotic expansions for the q- 1-Hermite of Ismail and Masson, q-Laguerre and Stieltjes-Wigert polynomials using a discrete analogue of Laplace's method. We found that when certain variables are above some critical values, the main terms in the asymptotics in the bulk contain Ramanujan function Aq(z), when the variables are below these critical values, however, the main terms in the asymptotics expansion in the bulk involve theta functions.

In this paper we further investigate the properties of Ramanujan function Aq(z). In §[\ref=sec:Preliminaries] we introduce the notations and prove inequalities on Ismail-Masson polynomials [formula] and Stieltjes-Wigert polynomials [formula] . In §[\ref=sec:Some-Inequalities-for], we derive two inequalities for Ramanujan function Aq(z). We use the asymptotic formulas in [\cite=Ismail7] to prove two definite integrals of Aq(z) in §[\ref=sec:Definite-Integrals-for].

Preliminaries

In this section and the next section we will tacitly assume that all the log  and power functions are taken as their principle branches, unless it is stated otherwise. As in our papers [\cite=Ismail6] [\cite=Ismail7], we will follow the usual notations from q-series [\cite=Andrews4] [\cite=Gasper] [\cite=Ismail2]

[formula]

Thoughout this paper, we shall always assume that

[formula]

hence n =   ∞   is allowed in the above definitions. Then,

[formula]

and

[formula]

for k = 0,1,...,n.

We will use the q-binomial theorem [\cite=Andrews4] [\cite=Gasper] [\cite=Ismail2],

[formula]

and the following limiting cases, also known as Euler's formulas,

[formula]

Ramanujan function Aq(z) is defined as [\cite=Ramanujan] [\cite=Ismail2]

[formula]

Ismail-Masson Polynomials [formula]

Ismail-Masson polynomials [formula] are defined as [\cite=Ismail2]

[formula]

Ismail-Masson polynomials satisfy

[formula]

for n,m = 0,1,..., where

[formula]

It is clear that their orthonormal polynomials are defined as

[formula]

Let

[formula]

and assume that

[formula]

It is easy to see that

[formula]

It is also clear from [\eqref=eq:2.8] and [\eqref=eq:2.12] that

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

or

[formula]

Stieltjes-Wigert Polynomials [formula]

Stieltjes-Wigert polynomials [formula] are defined as [\cite=Ismail2]

[formula]

They are orthogonal respect to the weight function

[formula]

with

[formula]

for n,m = 0,1,.... The orthonormal Stieltjes-Wigert polynomials with positive leading coefficients are

[formula]

In the case of the Stieltjes-Wigert polynomials the appropriate scaling is

[formula]

A calculation gives

[formula]

Set x = xn(t,u) in [\eqref=eq:2.17] then replace k by n - k to see that

[formula]

Thus,

or

[formula]

Some Inequalities for Aq(z)

It is clear that

[formula]

for [formula], then,

[formula]

for [formula] and for any complex number z. Applying Lebesgue's dominated convergent theorem we have

[formula]

for any [formula], hence Aq(z) is really one of many q-analogues of the exponential function. From [\eqref=eq:3.2] we also have obtained the inequality

[formula]

or

[formula]

for any complex number z. For any nonzero complex number z, then

[formula]

For k = 0,1,..., the terms qk(k - 1)|z|k are bounded by

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

or we have

[formula]

for any nonzero complex number z.

Assume that Aq(z) is Ramanujan function defined in [\eqref=eq:2.6], then, for any complex number z,

[formula]

and ,

[formula]

for any complex number [formula].

The trivial inequality [\eqref=eq:3.1] can be used to show that a basic hypergeometric series converges to its hypergeometric series counter-part under suitable scaling and conditions. Also, using [\eqref=eq:3.10] the formulas [\eqref=eq:2.16] and [\eqref=eq:2.24] could be recast into other forms.

Definite Integrals for Aq(z)

Put [formula] in formula (64) of [\cite=Ismail7], we have

[formula]

with

[formula]

Assuming that Aq(z) and wIM(x|q) are defined as in [\eqref=eq:2.7] and [\eqref=eq:2.10]. Then,

[formula]

For the orthonormal Ismail-Masson polynomials h̃n(x|q) [formula]satisfy

[formula]

Assume u > 0 and make the change of variable

[formula]

in [\eqref=eq:4.4], we have

[formula]

or

[formula]

Thus we have

[formula]

From [\eqref=eq:2.11], [\eqref=eq:2.14] and [\eqref=eq:2.16] we have

[formula]

and from [\eqref=eq:3.10] and [\eqref=eq:2.10] we know that

[formula]

is bounded for [formula]. From [\eqref=eq:3.9] we know that

[formula]

is bounded for [formula]. Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem allows us to take limit inside the integral. We use [\eqref=eq:4.1] to get [\eqref=eq:4.3].

Take t = 2 in the formula (69) of [\cite=Ismail7],

[formula]

with

[formula]

Assuming that Aq(z), and wSW(x;q) are defined as in [\eqref=eq:2.7] and [\eqref=eq:2.18]. Then we have

[formula]

From the orthogonality of Stieltjes-Wigert polynomials, we know that the orthonormal polynomials s̃N(x;q) satisfy

[formula]

Let us make a change of variable

[formula]

in [\eqref=eq:4.15] with u > 0, then,

[formula]

therefore,

[formula]

From [\eqref=eq:2.20], [\eqref=eq:2.22] and [\eqref=eq:2.24] we have

[formula]

and by [\eqref=eq:2.14] and [\eqref=eq:3.10]

[formula]

is bounded for [formula], by [\eqref=eq:3.9],

[formula]

is bounded for [formula]. By Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem we interchange the orders of limit and integration, then apply [\eqref=eq:4.12] to get [\eqref=eq:4.14].
