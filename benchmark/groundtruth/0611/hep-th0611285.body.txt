Introduction

In recent years, studies of exact solutions to the higher dimensional Einstein equations have attracted much attention in the context of supergravity and superstring theories [\cite=MP] [\cite=HHT] [\cite=GLPP1] [\cite=GLPP2] [\cite=CLP1] [\cite=CLP2]. Here, we revisit a class of D-dimensional metrics discussed by Chen, Lü and Pope [\cite=CLP2] : (a) D = 2n

[formula]

(b) D = 2n + 1

[formula]

The functions [formula] are given by

[formula]

where Xμ is an arbitrary function depending only on xμ. The remaining functions are

[formula]

(A(0)μ = A(0) = 1) and S = c / A(n) with a constant c. It has been shown by means of computer calculation that the metrics satisfy the Einstein equations Ric(g) = Λg for dimensions D  ≤  15 if Xμ takes the form : (a) D = 2n

[formula]

(b) D = 2n + 1

[formula]

where c,c2k and bμ are free parameters. This class of metrics gives the Kerr-NUT-de Sitter metric [\cite=CLP2], and the solutions in [\cite=MP] [\cite=HHT] [\cite=GLPP1] [\cite=GLPP2] [\cite=CLP1] are recovered by choosing special parameters. However, the explicit Riemannian curvature was not given in their analysis. So it is obscure how the metrics become solutions to the Einstein equations. In this paper we give a systematic investigation of the Riemannian curvature. We show that they can be concisely written by using a single function. We also prove that the metrics (1.1) and (1.2) are of type D and under the conditions (1.5) and (1.6) they becomes Einstein metrics for all dimensions. This family of metrics are also interesting from the point of view of AdS/CFT correspondence. Indeed, odd dimensional Einstein metrics lead to Sasaki-Einstein metrics by taking the BPS limit [\cite=HSY] [\cite=CLPP1] [\cite=CLPP2] [\cite=CLP2] and even dimensional Einstein metrics lead to Calabi-Yau metrics in the limit [\cite=CLP2] [\cite=OY] [\cite=LP]. Especially, the five dimensional Sasaki-Einstein metrics have emerged quite naturally in the AdS/CFT correspondence.

D = 2n

For the metric (1.1) we introduce the following orthonormal frame {ea}  =  {eμ,en + μ} [formula]:

[formula]

Using the first structure equation

[formula]

and ωab  =    -  ωba, we obtain connection 1-forms ωab. A straightforward calculation gives

[formula]

From the second structure equation

[formula]

we can calculate the curvature 2-forms Rab. It is convenient to introduce a quantity

[formula]

We find (μ  ≠  ν)

[formula]

Let Iμ be the differential operator

[formula]

The components [formula] of the Ricci curvature are calculated as

[formula]

Using the expression [formula] we have

[formula]

where X'μ = dXμ / dxμ and X''μ = d2Xμ / dx2μ. Thus, the scalar curvature [formula] takes the form

[formula]

Einstein Condition

We first study a condition R=const. By (2.10) and the identities

[formula]

([formula]),  it is easy to see that the function

[formula]

gives a constant scalar curvature R =  - 2n(2n - 1)c2n for arbitrary constants c2k,bμ and dμ. Conversely, we can show that the condition R=const. implies (2.12). In fact, from (2.10) one has

[formula]

where

[formula]

Applying the differential operator (∂  /  ∂xμ)2n - 1 to this relation we obtain

[formula]

which means that Xμ must be polynomials of order 2n. Taking Xμ in the general polynomials of order 2n we infer from (2.13) that they have the form (2.12). Thus, we have shown that the scalar curvature is a constant if and only if Xμ takes of the form (2.12).

Now, we can examine the Einstein condition, i.e. Rab  =  Λδab, where Λ represents a cosmological constant. Substituting (2.12) into (2.9) we obtain

[formula]

where

[formula]

The Einstein condition requires [formula]=const. This implies [formula], and then Kμ = 0. Therefore, denoting the common value of dμ by c0 we reproduce the function Xμ given in (1.5). It should be noticed that

[formula]

where

[formula]

The Ricci curvature is given by

[formula]

with λ =  - c2n. From (2.6) the corresponding curvature two forms are written as (μ  ≠  ν)

[formula]

If we put bμ = 0 for all μ, then equations represent the constant curvature space, [formula].

Kähler Condition

The natural Kähler form associated with the metric (1.1) is

[formula]

This two-form is not closed, but there exists a scaling limit in which it becomes closed. Indeed we can take a limit xμ = 1 + εξμ ~  ~ (ε  →  0) together with a suitable transformation of the coordinates ψk. Then, we have a closed two-form in the form [formula], where σi are the elementary symmetric polynomials of ξμ's. Now the metric (1.1) reduces to the Kähler metric presented in [\cite=ACG] (see Proposition 11).

D = 2n + 1

For the metric (1.2) we introduce the following orthonormal frame {êa}  =  {êμ,ên + μ,ê2n + 1} [formula]:

[formula]

where eμ and en + μ are defined by (2.1). The connection 1-forms ab are given by

[formula]

with ωab defined by (2.3). Shifting the arbitrary function Xμ by

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Then, the curvature two forms R̂μν,R̂μ,n + ν and R̂n + μ,n + ν are obtained by the replacement QT  →  T in (2.6), and the remaining ones are calculated as

[formula]

The Ricci curvature ab and the scalar curvature [formula] are given by

[formula]

and

[formula]

Einstein Condition

Using similar arguments to the case of D = 2n, we can show that the scalar curvature is a constant if and only if Xμ takes of the form

[formula]

Then the components of the Ricci curvature are

[formula]

which satisfy the Einstein condition if and only if dμ vanishes for all μ. Thus we reproduce the function Xμ given in (1.6). Now ab  =  2nλδab with λ =  - c2n and QT is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

By substituting these expressions into (2.6) and (3.5), we obtain (2.21) replaced V with V̂, and

[formula]

If we choose all of bμ as an equal value, then V̂ = 0 and hence the equations represent the constant curvature space.

Concluding Remarks

We have explicitly calculated the Riemannian curvature corresponding to the metrics (1.1) and (1.2). The components have a compact expression by introducing the single function QT. We have also proved that the conditions (1.5) and (1.6) lead to the Einstein metrics for all dimensions.

Finally we comment on type D condition [\cite=CMPP]. For fixed μ let us define the complex vector fields

[formula]

Then [formula] gives a null orthonormal frame for (1.1) or (1.2) :

[formula]

The covariant derivatives are given by [formula], which can be easily calculated by (2.3) and (3.2). Especially, we have

[formula]

which means that the integral curve of k is a geodesic. It is easy to confirm that the Weyl curvature satisfies the type D condition:

[formula]
