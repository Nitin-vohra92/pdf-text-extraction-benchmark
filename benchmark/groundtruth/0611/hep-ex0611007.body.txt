CHARM SPECTROSCOPY and EXOTICS AT ZEUS

Introduction

Light and charmed mesons and baryons are produced copiously in ep collisions with a centre-of-mass energy of 318  GeV at HERA. During the first phase of the HERA operation (1992-2000), the ZEUS Collaboration accumulated a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of [formula]pb- 1. Results on pentaquark searches, deuteron and antideuteron production and charmed-meson spectroscopy, obtained by the ZEUS Collaboration using the HERA I data, are summarised in this note.

Strange pentaquarks

A peak in the [formula] invariant mass spectrum around 1520  MeV was observed in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) by the ZEUS Collaboration [\cite=zeus_theta]. In Fig. 1, the spectrum is shown for Q2 > 20  GeV2, where Q2 is the exchanged-photon virtuality The statistical significance of the signal varies between 3.9  σ and 4.6  σ depending upon the treatment of the background. The candidate Θ+ signal was found to be produced predominantly in the forward (proton) direction in the laboratory frame [\cite=zeus_theta_study]. This is unlike the case for the Λ(1520) and can indicate that Θ+ may have an unusual production mechanism related to the proton-remnant fragmentation. Using a smaller integrated luminosity, the H1 Collaboration did not observe the candidate Θ+ signal and set an upper limit on its production [\cite=h1_theta]. The production cross section for the Θ+ candidate, measured by the ZEUS Collaboration [\cite=zeus_thexs], is [formula] for Q2 > 20  GeV2. The value is larger than, but consistent with, the upper limit obtained by the H1 Collaboration.

The ZEUS Collaboration performed also a search for two strange pentaquarks, reported by the NA49 Collaboration [\cite=na49_pq], and observed no signal in the Ξπ invariant mass spectrum [\cite=zeus_xi]. Upper limits on the ratio of a possible Ξ-  -3 / 2(Ξ03 / 2) signal to the Ξ0(1530) signal were set in the mass range 1.65 - 2.35  GeV.

Deuterons and antideuterons

A first observation of deuteron and antideuteron production in ep collisions in the DIS regime has been recently reported by the ZEUS collaboration [\cite=zeus_deuteron]. To identify the particles, the measurement of the energy losses, dE / dx, in the central tracking detector has been used.

Figure 2 shows the mass spectra for positive and negative tracks with dE / dx > 2.5  mips (minimum ionising particles) in DIS events with Q2 > 1  GeV2. For each track, the mass has been calculated from the track momentum and dE / dx value using a parametrisation based on the Bethe-Bloch equation. The number of deuteron and antideuteron candidates in the mass window 1.5 < M < 2.5  GeV is 309 and 62, respectively. No antitritons have been observed, Given the small number of the triton candidates, no statement on the triton observation in DIS has been made.

Small contributions to the observed signals from the secondary interactions in the beam-pipe and detector material have been subtracted using side bands of the distribution on the distance of the closest approach of a track to the beam spot in the transverse plane. Possible contamination of the observed deuteron signal due to interactions of the proton or electron beam with the residual gas in the beam-pipe has been found to be below 20%.

Figure 3 shows the [formula] and [formula] production ratios, corrected for the detector and trigger effects, as a function of pT / M. The measured [formula] ratio is consistent with unity. The [formula] ratios are in fair agreement with those obtained in pp interactions [\cite=pp_deuteron], in hadronic Υ decays [\cite=argus_deuteron], and by the H1 Collaboration at HERA in the photoproduction regime (Q2 < 1  GeV2) [\cite=h1_deuteron].

No antideuteron candidates have been found in the current region of the Breit frame [\cite=breit]. Since the region is similar to a single hemisphere of the e+e- annihilation process, the antideuteron observation in DIS does not contradict to the small antideuteron rates observed at LEP [\cite=lep_deuteron].

Charmed pentaquark

An observation of a candidate for the charmed pentaquark state, [formula], decaying to D*    ±p∓ was reported by the H1 Collaboration [\cite=h1_ch5q]. A fit of the signal in DIS yielded [formula] signal events and the mass of [formula]MeV. The observed resonance was reported to contribute [formula] of the D*    ± production rate in the kinematic range studied in DIS [\cite=h1_thetac_study]. The measured differential distributions were found to be consistent with the fragmentation modelling of the candidate Θ0c production.

The observation of the H1 Collaboration was challenged by the ZEUS Collaboration [\cite=zeus_ch5q]. Using a larger sample of D*    ± mesons, ZEUS observed no signature of the narrow resonance in the M(D*    ±p∓) spectra shown in Fig. 4. The Monte Carlo Θ0c signals normalised to 1% of the number of reconstructed D*    ± mesons are shown on top of the fitted backgrounds. The upper limit on the fraction of D*    ± mesons originating from Θ0c decays was evaluated to be 0.23% (95% C.L.). The upper limit for DIS with Q2 > 1  GeV2 is 0.35% (95% C.L.).

Studies of excited D mesons

Sizeable production of the excited charmed, D01 and D* 02, and charmed-strange, D+s1, mesons has been observed in ep interactions by the ZEUS collaboration [\cite=zeus_d1d2] [\cite=zeus_d1s]. Figure 5 shows the distribution of the M(K0s) for the [formula] candidates. A clear signal is seen at the nominal value of M(). The measured [formula], [formula] and [formula] rates were converted to the fractions of c quarks hadronising as a particular excited charmed meson. These fragmentation fractions agree with previous measurements in e+e- annihilations.

The helicity angular distribution of the D±s1 signal was fitted to a form 1 + R cos 2α, where R is a helicity parameter and the helicity angle (α) is defined as the angle between the K0S and πS momenta in the [formula] rest frame. The unbinned likelihood fit yielded the value [formula]. This value is consistent with the helicity parameter value - 0.23+ 0.40- 0.32 obtained by the CLEO Collaboration for [formula] meson in the D* 0K± final state [\cite=cleo_d1s]. The present measurement does not contradict the conclusion of the CLEO Collaboration that R = 0 and, thus, the spin-parity of the D+s1 is 1+. However, this measurement is also consistent with R =  - 1, expected for spin-parities 1- and 2+ [\cite=godfrey_kokoski]. Recently, a precise measurements of the [formula] helicity parameter, [formula], has been reported by the Belle Collaboration [\cite=belle_d1s]. The measured value has been interpreted as a result of the D and S waves mixture due to an interference of the [formula] meson with the recently discovered DsJ(2460)+ meson.

The ZEUS search for the radially excited [formula] meson, reported by the DELPHI Collaboration [\cite=delphi_drad], revealed no signal [\cite=zeus_d1d2]. The upper limit on the product of the fraction of c quarks hadronising as a [formula] meson and the branching ratio of the [formula] decay to D*  +π+π- was estimated to be 0.7% (95% C.L.). This limit is somewhat stronger than the 0.9% limit obtained by the OPAL Collaboration [\cite=opal_drad].
