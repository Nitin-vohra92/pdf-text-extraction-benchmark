Introduction

Let [formula] be the finite field of order q, where q is an arbitrary prime power. For a code C over [formula] (or in other words a q-ary code), we denote by n(C) its length and by d(C) its minimum distance. We write |M| for the cardinality of a finite set M.

For any prime power q, let αq and αlinq denote the important functions in the asymptotic theory of codes which are defined by

[formula]

and

[formula]

Here Uq (resp. Ulinq) is the set of all ordered pairs (δ,R)∈[0,1]2 for which there exists a sequence {Ci}∞i = 1 of not necessarily linear (resp. linear) codes over [formula] such that n(Ci)  →    ∞   as i  →    ∞   and

[formula]

where log q is the logarithm to the base q. We refer to [\cite=TV] for some basic properties of the functions αq and αlinq. In particular, both functions are nonincreasing on the interval

[formula]

A(q) := lim sup ,

[formula]

The Basic Code Construction

In this section we present our basic construction of q-ary codes (see Theorem [\ref=theorem.basic] and Corollary [\ref=corollary.basic.linear]). We fix a global function field F with full constant field [formula] and with at least one rational place. Let n  ≥  1 be the number of rational places of F and let [formula] be all rational places of F. Let h be the class number of F. Let vP be the normalized discrete valuation of F corresponding to the place P of F. Let [formula] be the set of all places of F. For [formula],

[formula]

denotes the principal divisor of f and

[formula]

denotes the zero divisor of f. For an arbitrary divisor

[formula]

of F, we write vP(G) for the coefficient mP of P. We use the standard notation

[formula]

for the Riemann-Roch space of G. In this section and in Section [\ref=section.cardinality], all places and divisors are from the given global function field F. We fix an integer m  ≥  1.

For a positive divisor D, let [formula] be the divisor

[formula]

where ai  =   min (m + 1,vPi(D)) for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n.

For a positive divisor D, let

[formula]

Moreover, we define

[formula]

For integers r  ≥  s  ≥  0 and nonnegative integers [formula], let [formula] be the set consisting of the positive divisors D of the global function field F satisfying all of the following:

Condition 1: deg (D) = r and [formula],

Condition 2:

[formula]

Condition 3: [formula].

For integers r  ≥  s  ≥  0 and nonnegative integers [formula], if

[formula]

then there exists a divisor G of degree r such that [formula] and for each [formula], if E = (f)0 satisfies Conditions 2 and 3 of Definition [\ref=definition.V.m] with the given [formula], then [formula].

As [formula], there exists a degree r divisor G such that [formula] for any [formula]. Using the Weak Approximation Theorem [\cite=S], we can assume that [formula] without loss of generality (compare with [\cite=NO2]). Let [formula], D = G + (f), and E = (f)0. Since [formula] and D is positive, we have [formula]. Assume that Conditions 2 and 3 of Definition [\ref=definition.V.m] are satisfied by E. If [formula], then [formula] and hence [formula], which is a contradiction. Thus, we must have [formula].

Now give another definition related to our construction.

For [formula], let [formula], [formula] be the subsets of [formula] defined by

[formula]

The following two lemmas are related to Definition [\ref=definition.I.i] and important for our construction.

For [formula], we have

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] [formula]. Let [formula] be the set consisting of the [formula] such that [formula] or [formula]. If [formula], then [formula] and the result follows immediately. If [formula], then for each i∈A, let [formula] be the largest integer such that [formula] or [formula]. For each i∈A, we have

[formula]

and also [formula] or [formula]. Hence for each i∈A we obtain

[formula]

We complete the proof by summing over all i∈A.

For [formula], we have the following containment relations:

[formula]

First we consider the case of the subscript m and we assume that [formula]. Then α(i)m  ≠  β(i)m and at least one of α(i)m and β(i)m is nonzero. Hence [formula].

Next we consider the case of the subscript m - 1 and we assume that [formula]. We have α(i)m  =  β(i)m and α(i)m - 1  ≠  β(i)m - 1. If α(i)m  =  β(i)m  ≠  0, then [formula]. If α(i)m  =  β(i)m  =  0, then since at least one of α(i)m - 1 and β(i)m - 1 is nonzero, we get [formula].

Now we consider the case of the subscript m - 2. Assume that [formula]. Then α(i)m  =  β(i)m, α(i)m - 1  =  β(i)m - 1, and α(i)m - 2  ≠  β(i)m - 2. If α(i)m  =  β(i)m  ≠  0, then [formula]. If α(i)m  =  β(i)m = 0 and α(i)m - 1  =  β(i)m - 1  ≠  0, then [formula]. Finally, if α(i)m  =  β(i)m = 0 and α(i)m - 1  =  β(i)m - 1  =  0, then since α(i)m - 2 and β(i)m - 2 are distinct, we get [formula] or [formula]. We complete the proof similarly for each subscript 1  ≤  ν  ≤  m.

For each [formula], let ti be a local parameter of F at Pi. Assume that G is a divisor with [formula] and [formula]. For f in the Riemann-Roch space L(G), the local expansion of f at Pi has the form

[formula]

with [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n and l  ≥  0. For each [formula], let

[formula]

Let [formula] be the [formula]-linear map defined by

[formula]

Moreover, let ψ be the [formula]-linear map

[formula]

For a divisor G with [formula] and [formula], let [formula]. Moreover, let E = (f)0 be the zero divisor of f and [formula]. Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

For each 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, using Definition [\ref=definition.I.i] we obtain

[formula]

Hence by Definition [\ref=definition.j.i.Jm] we have

[formula]

Using ([\ref=relation.j.i.J.m]) we complete the proof.

For [formula] and nonnegative real numbers [formula] with [formula], let [formula] be the subset of [formula] defined by

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Now we are ready to give our basic code construction. Assume that r  ≥  s  ≥  0 are integers and [formula] are real numbers such that

[formula]

Let G be a divisor of degree r obtained using ([\ref=assumption1]) and Proposition [\ref=proposition.existence.G]. Recall the linear maps [formula] and ψ defined in ([\ref=definition.Phi]) and ([\ref=definition.psi]), respectively, using the chosen divisor G. The map [formula] is not necessarily surjective. If

[formula]

then there exists [formula] such that for the set

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Assume that r  ≥  s  ≥  0 are integers and that [formula] are nonnegative real numbers with [formula] satisfying ([\ref=assumption1]). Let G be a divisor of degree r obtained using ([\ref=assumption1]) and Proposition [\ref=proposition.existence.G]. Assume also that ([\ref=assumption2]) holds and that

[formula]

Using the chosen divisor G and ([\ref=assumption2]), let [formula] be such that the set [formula] satisfies ([\ref=N.c.lower.bound]). Let C be the q-ary code of length n given by [formula]. Then for the cardinality |C| of C we have

[formula]

and for the minimum distance d(C) of C we have

[formula]

Let [formula] be such that f1  ≠  f2 and put f = f1 - f2∈L(G). Let E be the zero divisor of f and

[formula]

be the divisor defined in Definition [\ref=definition.restrict.divisor]. Let [formula] and [formula]. We have

[formula]

As [formula], we also have

[formula]

Using ([\ref=ep1.theorem.basic]), ([\ref=ep2.theorem.basic]), Lemmas [\ref=lemma.relation.J.m.I.i] and [\ref=lemma.bound.on.I.wighted.cardinality.sum], we obtain that

[formula]

Moreover, using ([\ref=ep1.theorem.basic]), ([\ref=ep2.theorem.basic]), Lemmas [\ref=lemma.relation.J.m.I.i] and [\ref=lemma.second.bound.on.I.i], we further obtain that

[formula]

Hence by the choice of the divisor G (cf. Proposition [\ref=proposition.existence.G]), we have

[formula]

Moreover, we obtain

[formula]

where we used ([\ref=ep3.theorem.basic]). Let ||ψ(f)|| denote the Hamming weight of the vector [formula]. Then using Definition [\ref=definition.j.i.Jm] and ([\ref=relation.j.i.J.m]), we have

[formula]

Therefore we obtain

[formula]

Using ([\ref=e1.theorem.basic]) we obtain that d(C)  ≥  1, and so the map ψ is one-to-one on [formula]. Therefore [formula], and hence the lower bound on |C| follows from ([\ref=N.c.lower.bound]). This completes the proof.

In a special case related to Theorem [\ref=theorem.basic], we make sure to construct linear codes. Later in this paper, the following result will be used to obtain lower bounds on the function αlinq(δ), which is defined in ([\ref=definition.alpha.linear.q.delta]).

Assume that r  ≥  s  ≥  0 are integers and that [formula] satisfy ([\ref=assumption1]). Let G be a divisor of degree r obtained using ([\ref=assumption1]) and Proposition [\ref=proposition.existence.G]. Assume also that

[formula]

and that (m + 1)n  ≥  s. Using the chosen divisor G and the kernel of the corresponding map [formula], put [formula]. Then C is a linear code over [formula] of length n. Moreover, for the dimension of C we have

[formula]

and for the minimum distance d(C) of C we have

[formula]

The kernel of [formula] is an [formula]-linear subspace of L(G) and is the Riemann-Roch space given by

[formula]

As [formula], using ([\ref=e1.corollary.basic.linear]) we obtain that [formula]. The maps [formula] and ψ are [formula]-linear, and hence C is a linear code over [formula]. We obtain the bounds on the dimension and the minimum distance of C using similar methods as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem.basic].

For [formula], the conditions ([\ref=assumption2]) and ([\ref=e1.corollary.basic.linear]) are equivalent.

The Cardinality of [formula]

In this section we will compute the cardinality of the set [formula] for integers r  ≥  s  ≥  0 and nonnegative integers [formula] (see Definition [\ref=definition.V.m] for the definition of this set). The notation we introduced in Section [\ref=section.basic.construction] remains operative.

For any positive divisor D, we have

[formula]

For [formula], let [formula]. Note that [formula] for each [formula]. We have

[formula]

and also

[formula]

This completes the proof.

For integers r  ≥  t  ≥  0 and [formula], let [formula] be the set of positive divisors given by

[formula]

For integers r  ≥  t  ≥  0 and [formula], the set [formula] is not empty if and only if

[formula]

holds and also provided that there exists a degree r - t positive divisor whose support is disjoint from the set [formula] when [formula] and r > t.

Let [formula]. Using Lemma [\ref=lemma.relation.on.j.and.degree] we have

[formula]

and so in particular

[formula]

Moreover by definition of [formula],

[formula]

where we used ([\ref=ep0.lemma.non.emptiness.mathcal.u]) in the second step. Therefore

[formula]

which means that

[formula]

Also, if this is an equality, then the set [formula] is empty. Therefore, if equality in ([\ref=ep1.lemma.non.emptiness.mathcal.u]) holds and r > t, then there exists a positive divisor of degree r - t whose support is disjoint from [formula].

Now we prove the converse. Let [formula], [formula], , [formula]. They are pairwise disjoint sets of natural numbers. We note that for each [formula], we have [formula]. Comparing both sides of the inequalities for t given in the statement of the lemma, we obtain that

[formula]

Let

[formula]

Using the upper bound on t in the statement of the lemma, we get j0  ≥  0. Moreover, using [formula] we obtain

[formula]

Let [formula]. Note that [formula] are pairwise disjoint subsets of [formula]. For each [formula], let

[formula]

Assume that [formula] and put

[formula]

We claim that [formula]. It follows from the construction that

[formula]

where we used ([\ref=ep2.lemma.non.emptiness.mathcal.u]). Moreover [formula], [formula] for each [formula], and hence [formula].

Next we consider the case [formula]. This case implies that (cf. ([\ref=ep2.lemma.non.emptiness.mathcal.u]))

[formula]

Therefore we construct [formula] similarly and D using the existence of a degree r - t positive divisor whose support is disjoint from the set [formula].

For integers a  ≥  b  ≥  0 with b  ≤  n and a set [formula] of rational places, let Ca,b denote the cardinality of the set of positive divisors given by

[formula]

Note that Ca,b is independent of the choice of the set [formula], only the cardinality b of this set matters.

For r  ≥  t  ≥  0, [formula], and [formula], the cardinality of [formula] is

[formula]

We prove the lemma for m = 2 and the general case is similar. For D∈U(r,t;j1,j2), let [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula]. Note that |S2| = j2 and |S1| = j1 and that by ([\ref=ep0.lemma.non.emptiness.mathcal.u]) we get |S0| = j0(D) = 3n - (2j1 + 3j2) - t. The choices of S2, S1, and S0 determine S. We have |S| = n - (j1 + j2)  -  |S0| = t - 2n + (j1 + 2j2). Hence there are

[formula]

choices for these subsets. Assume that the subsets S2, S1, S0, and S are determined. For a corresponding D∈U(r,t;j1,j2), let [formula], where

[formula]

Moreover let E = D - D1. Then E is a positive divisor and [formula]. Note that

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Using Definition [\ref=constant.C.a.b], we obtain that there are Cr - 2n + (j1 + 2j2),t - 2n + (j1 + 2j2) choices for E, which completes the proof.

Recall that for integers r  ≥  s  ≥  0 and nonnegative integers [formula], the set [formula] is defined in Definition [\ref=definition.V.m]. Using Definition [\ref=definition.set.U] and Lemma [\ref=lemma.non.emptiness.mathcal.u], we can write the set [formula] as the disjoint union

[formula]

where the m-tuples [formula] of indices run over the finite set of m-tuples of integers satisfying

[formula]

and for each m-tuple satisfying ([\ref=running.space.j.m.tuple]), the index t runs from [formula] to [formula].

Combining ([\ref=disjoint.V.m]) and Lemma [\ref=lemma.cardinality.U], we can compute the cardinality of the set [formula].

Asymptotic Upper Bound on the Cardinality of V1(r,s;X1)

In this section we obtain an asymptotic upper bound on the cardinality of [formula] for the case m = 1 in a suitable sequence of global function fields (see Corollary [\ref=corollary.asymptotic.card.V.1]). The assumption m = 1 is made for simplicity and for the clarity of the exposition. Later in Section [\ref=section.asymptotic.size.V.m.case.m.general] we generalize this asymptotic upper bound to the case m  ≥  1.

The asymptotic upper bound for the cardinality of [formula] will be used later to prove the existence of a sequence of distinguished divisors on the basis of Proposition [\ref=proposition.existence.G].

Let E be the real-valued function defined on the interval

[formula]

Using Stirling's formula, we obtain the following well-known results. For any real number 0  ≤  α  ≤  1, we have

[formula]

For any real numbers 0  ≤  α1  ≤  1 and 0  ≤  α2  <  1 with α1  +  α2  ≤  1, we have

[formula]

Now we state an important assumption and introduce related notation.

We will use the following proposition in our upper bounds.

Under Assumption 1, let (ai)∞i = 1 and (bi)∞i = 1 be sequences of integers such that ai  ≥  bi  ≥  0 and bi  ≤  ni for all i  ≥  1. We also assume that there exist the limits

[formula]

For each i  ≥  1, let C(i)ai,bi denote the cardinality of the set of positive divisors given in Definition [\ref=constant.C.a.b] for a suitable set [formula] of rational places of Fi. Then we have

[formula]

This follows from Definition [\ref=constant.C.a.b] and the proof of [\cite=TV].

Let y,σ,x1  ≥  0 be real numbers. Under Assumption 1, for each i  ≥  1 we define the integers

[formula]

Let V(i)1(ri,si;X(i)1) be the set of positive divisors of degree ri of Fi, which is defined using Definition [\ref=definition.V.m]. We note that for each real number 0  ≤  t1  ≤  2x1 and each integer i  ≥  1, we have

[formula]

Moreover, if

[formula]

holds, then for each real number 0  ≤  t1  ≤  2x1 and integer i  ≥  1 we also have

[formula]

For real numbers y > 0, x1,σ  ≥  0 satisfying ([\ref=Assumption3]) and real numbers 0  ≤  t1  ≤  2x1, [formula], let S(σ,y,x,t1) be the real-valued function

[formula]

Note that by ([\ref=Assumption3]) we have 4x1 < 1 and hence [formula].

Under Assumption 1, let y > 0 and x1,σ  ≥  0 be real numbers satisfying ([\ref=Assumption3]). For each integer i  ≥  1 and real numbers 0  ≤  t1  ≤  2x1, [formula], let [formula] be the set of positive divisors of Fi defined in Definition [\ref=definition.set.U] for m = 1. Then for the cardinalities of these sets we have

[formula]

Note that ni  -  ⌊t1ni⌋  ≤  ⌊(1 + y + x)ni⌋ and using ([\ref=Assumption3]) we get ⌊(1 + y + x)ni⌋  ≤  2ni  -  2⌊t1ni⌋ for each x and t1 in the range under consideration. Hence using Lemma [\ref=lemma.cardinality.U], we obtain

[formula]

Using ([\ref=asymptotic.binomial.alpha]) and ([\ref=asymptotic.binomial.alpha1.alpha2]), we obtain

[formula]

Note that [formula] and [formula]. Hence from Proposition [\ref=proposition.C.a.b] we get

[formula]

Using ([\ref=ep1.proposition.asymtotic.cardinality.U.1]), ([\ref=ep2.proposition.asymtotic.cardinality.U.1]), ([\ref=ep3.proposition.asymtotic.cardinality.U.1]), and Definition [\ref=definition.S], we complete the proof.

Under Assumption 1, let y > 0 and x1,σ  ≥  0 be real numbers satisfying ([\ref=Assumption3]). For each integer i  ≥  1, let ri,si, and X(i)1 be the integers defined in ([\ref=definition.r.i.s.i.W.i]) and let V(i)1(ri,si;X(i)1) be the set of positive divisors of Fi defined in Definition [\ref=definition.V.m] for m = 1. Then for the cardinalities of these sets we have

[formula]

where the maximum is over all real numbers x and t1 satisfying [formula] and 0  ≤  t1  ≤  2x1.

Using ([\ref=disjoint.V.m]) and Lemma [\ref=lemma.cardinality.U] for each i  ≥  1, we obtain that

[formula]

where t runs from max {si,ni - j1} to min {ri,2ni - 2j1}. Note that si  ≥  ni - j1 and ri  ≤  2ni  -  2j1 for each i  ≥  1 and 0  ≤  j1  ≤  2X(i)1. Moreover, for the number of terms [formula] in the summation in ([\ref=ep1.corollary.asymptotic.card.V.1]) we have

[formula]

Therefore, using the method of the proof of [\cite=NO2] and Proposition [\ref=proposition.asymtotic.cardinality.U.1], we complete the proof.

Under Assumption 1, let y > 0 and x1  ≥  0 be real numbers such that y + 4x1  <  1. For σ  ≥  0 and [formula], let Iy,x1(σ) be the real-valued function of σ defined by

[formula]

where the maximum is over all real numbers x and t1 such that 0  ≤  t1  ≤  2x1 and [formula].

By straightforward manipulations, the expression for S(σ,y,x,t1) is simplified to

[formula]

We first show that Iy,x1(σ) is a strictly increasing function of σ.

Under the assumptions of Definition [\ref=definition.I.w], the real-valued function Iy,x1(σ) is a strictly increasing function of σ on its domain of definition, which is the interval of σ such that σ  ≥  0 and [formula].

Using the expression ([\ref=simplified.S.w]), for the partial derivative of S(σ,y,x,t1) with respect to σ we obtain

[formula]

Therefore [formula] for each [formula] and 0  ≤  t1  ≤  2x1. Moreover [formula] for 0  ≤  t1  ≤  2x1. This completes the proof.

Under the assumptions of Definition [\ref=definition.I.w], for the partial derivatives [formula] and [formula] of S(σ,y,x,t1) with respect to t1 and x we obtain

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let S1, T1, and T2 denote the following expressions from ([\ref=simplified.S.w]):

[formula]

For their partial derivatives with respect to t1 and x we obtain

[formula]

and

[formula]

Using ([\ref=simplified.S.w]) and combining the partial derivatives above, we get the desired formulas.

Under the assumptions of Definition [\ref=definition.I.w], furthermore if all of the following conditions

[formula],

[formula],

[formula],

hold, then we have

[formula]

Assume that [formula] and 0  ≤  t1  ≤  2x1. First we observe that

[formula]

Using condition C1 we obtain

[formula]

Moreover, using condition C2 we also get

[formula]

Therefore by Lemma [\ref=lemma.del.S.w.to.t1.x] and ([\ref=ep1.corollary.I.in.restricted.case]) we have [formula]. Similarly, condition C3 implies

[formula]

and by Lemma [\ref=lemma.del.S.w.to.t1.x] we also have [formula]. Hence we obtain [formula]. Using Definition [\ref=definition.S] we complete the proof.

Asymptotic Upper Bound on the Cardinality of [formula] for the General Case m  ≥  1

In this section we obtain generalizations of the results of Section [\ref=section.asymptotic.size.V.m.case.m.1] to the general case m  ≥  1. For simplicity we begin with the case m = 2, which corresponds to the two-variable case t1,t2.

Let γ  >  0 be as in Assumption 1 (cf. Section [\ref=section.asymptotic.size.V.m.case.m.1]). Let y > 0, x1,x2,σ  ≥  0 be real numbers satisfying

[formula]

For real numbers [formula] and 0  ≤  t1,t2 satisfying t2  ≤  2x2, t1  ≤  2x1  +  x2, and 2t1  +  3t2  ≤  2(2x1 + 3x2), let S(σ,y,x,t1,t2) be the real-valued function

[formula]

Note that by ([\ref=Assume.condition.on.y.x1.x2.sigma.m.2]) we have 2(2x1 + 3x2) < 1 and hence [formula].

Instead of stating a generalization of Proposition [\ref=proposition.asymtotic.cardinality.U.1] explicitly, we prefer to give a generalization of Corollary [\ref=corollary.asymptotic.card.V.1] directly in the following proposition, whose proof includes a generalization of Proposition [\ref=proposition.asymtotic.cardinality.U.1].

Under Assumption 1 (cf. Section [\ref=section.asymptotic.size.V.m.case.m.1]), let y  >  0 and x1,x2,σ  ≥  0 be real numbers satisfying ([\ref=Assume.condition.on.y.x1.x2.sigma.m.2]). For each integer i  ≥  1, let [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], and V(i)2(ri,si;X(i)1,X(i)2) be the set of positive divisors of Fi defined in Definition [\ref=definition.V.m] for m = 2. Then for the cardinalities of these sets we have

[formula]

where the maximum is over all real numbers x and t1,t2 satisfying [formula] and 0  ≤  t2  ≤  2x2, 0  ≤  t1  ≤  2x1 + x2, and 2t1  +  3t2  ≤  2(2x1 + 3x2).

We follow similar methods as in the proofs of Proposition [\ref=proposition.asymtotic.cardinality.U.1] and Corollary [\ref=corollary.asymptotic.card.V.1]. First note that for each integer i  ≥  1 and real numbers 0  ≤  t1,t2 with 2t1 + 3t2  ≤  2(2x1 + 3x2), using ([\ref=Assume.condition.on.y.x1.x2.sigma.m.2]) we obtain [formula]. Moreover it is also clear that [formula] for each integer i  ≥  1 and real numbers t1,t2  ≥  0. Hence using ([\ref=disjoint.V.m]) and Lemma [\ref=lemma.cardinality.U] as in the proof of Corollary [\ref=corollary.asymptotic.card.V.1], for integers i  ≥  1 and real numbers 0  ≤  x,t1,t2 such that [formula], t2  ≤  2x2, t1  ≤  2x1 + x2, and 2t1  +  3t2  ≤  2(2x1 + 3x2), we need to consider the cardinality [formula] of the set of positive divisors of Fi defined in Definition [\ref=definition.set.U] for m = 2. By Lemma [\ref=lemma.cardinality.U] we have

[formula]

We complete the proof using similar arguments as in the proofs of Proposition [\ref=proposition.asymtotic.cardinality.U.1] and Corollary [\ref=corollary.asymptotic.card.V.1].

Now we generalize Definition [\ref=definition.I.w].

Under Assumption 1 (cf. Section [\ref=section.asymptotic.size.V.m.case.m.1]), let y > 0 and x1,x2  ≥  0 be real numbers such that y + 2(2x1 + 3x2)  <  1. For σ  ≥  0 and [formula], let Iy,x1,x2(σ) be the real-valued function of σ defined by

[formula]

where the maximum is over all real numbers x,t1, and t2 such that [formula] and 0  ≤  t2  ≤  2x2, 0  ≤  t1  ≤  2x1 + x2, and 2t1  +  3t2  ≤  2(2x1 + 3x2).

The following lemma generalizes Lemma [\ref=lemma.I.is.increasing.of.sigma].

Under the assumptions of Definition [\ref=definition.I.w.case.m.2], the real-valued function Iy,x1,x2(σ) is a strictly increasing function of σ on its domain of definition, which is the interval of σ such that σ  ≥  0 and [formula].

For the partial derivative of S(σ,y,x,t1,t2) with respect to σ we obtain

[formula]

Then the proof is similar to the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma.I.is.increasing.of.sigma].

Now we give a generalization of Corollary [\ref=corollary.I.in.restricted.case] in the following proposition.

Under the assumptions of Definition [\ref=definition.I.w.case.m.2], assume also that all of the following conditions hold:

[formula],

[formula]

[formula]

[formula],

[formula]

Then we have Iy,x1,x2(σ) = S(σ,y,0,2x1,2x2).

As in the proof of Corollary [\ref=corollary.I.in.restricted.case], we first observe that for [formula] and 0  ≤  t1,t2 with t2  ≤  2x2, t1  ≤  2x1  +  x2, and 2t1  +  3t2  ≤  2(2x1 + 3x2), using condition C1 we obtain

[formula]

For the partial derivative [formula] of S(σ,y,x,t1,t2) with respect to x, using ([\ref=ep1.proposition.I.in.restricted.case.case.m.2]) and some straightforward manipulations we get

[formula]

By condition C3 we have

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

for [formula] and 0  ≤  t1,t2 with t2  ≤  2x2, t1  ≤  2x1 + x2, and 2t1 + 3t2  ≤  2(2x1 + 3x2).

Now we assume that

[formula]

For the partial derivatives [formula] and [formula] of S(σ,y,x,t1,t2) with respect to t1 and t2, again using ([\ref=ep1.proposition.I.in.restricted.case.case.m.2]) and some straightforward manipulations we get

[formula]

and

[formula]

Note that t1 + 2t2 assumes its maximum over the region

[formula]

when t1 = 2x1 and t2 = 2x2. Therefore we have

[formula]

over the region ([\ref=ep2.proposition.I.in.restricted.case.case.m.2]).

Using ([\ref=ep3.proposition.I.in.restricted.case.case.m.2]) and condition C2.1, we obtain

[formula]

Similarly, using ([\ref=ep3.proposition.I.in.restricted.case.case.m.2]) and condition C2.2 we obtain

[formula]

Hence we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

for [formula] and 0 < t1,t2 with t2  ≤  2x2, t1  ≤  2x1 + x2, and 2t1 + 3t2  ≤  2(2x1 + 3x2).

Then for fixed σ, y, and [formula], the function S(σ,y,x,t1,t2) assumes its maximum over the region ([\ref=ep2.proposition.I.in.restricted.case.case.m.2]) on the part of the boundary formed by the closed line connecting the two points

[formula]

The direction vector [formula] from A2 to A1 is parallel to the vector ( - 3,2). Hence for fixed σ, y, and [formula], the function S(σ,y,x,t1,t2) is nondecreasing on the closed line from A2 to A1 if

[formula]

holds for fixed σ, y, and [formula] and for each point (t1,t2) on the closed line from A2 to A1. By straightforward manipulations, we obtain that ([\ref=ep6.proposition.I.in.restricted.case.case.m.2]) is equivalent to

[formula]

We have t1  ≥  2x1, t2  ≤  2x2, and t1 + 2t2  ≤  2x1 + 4x2 on the closed line from A2 to A1. Therefore using [formula] and condition C4, we see that ([\ref=ep7.proposition.I.in.restricted.case.case.m.2]) holds. Hence S(y,σ,x,t1,t2) assumes its maximum at x = 0 and (t1,t2) = A1 = (2x1,2x2). It is easy to check that if the assumption ([\ref=ep1.in.the.middle.2.proposition.I.in.restricted.case.case.m.2]) does not hold, but the assumptions of the proposition hold, then similar methods also apply and we again have It,x1,x2(σ) = S(σ,y,0,2x1,2x2). This completes the proof.

Now that we have dealt with the cases m = 1 and m = 2, we present the generalizations for any m  ≥  1.

Under Assumption 1 (cf. Section [\ref=section.asymptotic.size.V.m.case.m.1]), let y > 0, [formula] be real numbers satisfying

[formula]

For real numbers [formula] and [formula] satisfying

[formula]

and

[formula]

let [formula] be the real-valued function

[formula]

Note that by ([\ref=condition.general.y.x1.x2.xm]) we have [formula], and hence using ([\ref=condition2.general.region.t1.t2.tm]) we obtain [formula].

We state the generalization of Proposition [\ref=propostion.asymptotic.card.V.m.case.2] whose proof is similar.

Under Assumption 1 (cf. Section [\ref=section.asymptotic.size.V.m.case.m.1]), let y  >  0 and [formula] be real numbers satisfying ([\ref=condition.general.y.x1.x2.xm]). For each integer i  ≥  1, let [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], , [formula], and [formula] be the set of positive divisors of Fi defined in Definition [\ref=definition.V.m]. Then for the cardinalities of these sets we have

[formula]

where the maximum is over all real numbers x and [formula] satisfying [formula] and the conditions in ([\ref=condition1.general.region.t1.t2.tm]) and ([\ref=condition2.general.region.t1.t2.tm]).

Now we generalize Definition [\ref=definition.I.w.case.m.2].

Under Assumption 1 (cf. Section [\ref=section.asymptotic.size.V.m.case.m.1]), let y > 0 and [formula] be real numbers such that [formula]. For σ  ≥  0 and [formula], let [formula] be the real-valued function of σ defined by

[formula]

where the maximum is over all real numbers [formula] with [formula] and [formula] satisfying conditions ([\ref=condition1.general.region.t1.t2.tm]) and ([\ref=condition2.general.region.t1.t2.tm]).

The proof of the next lemma generalizing Lemma [\ref=lemma.I.increasing.case.m.2] is also similar.

Under the assumptions of Definition [\ref=general.definition.I.y.x1.x2.xm], the real-valued function [formula] is a strictly increasing function of σ on its domain of definition, which is the interval of σ such that σ  ≥  0 and [formula].

Now we are ready to compute [formula] for general m under some conditions. We note that since the region defined by the conditions ([\ref=condition1.general.region.t1.t2.tm]) and ([\ref=condition2.general.region.t1.t2.tm]) is more complicated in the general case than the one in the case m = 2, we need to define new parameters in the following proposition in order to state the result.

Under the assumptions of Definition [\ref=general.definition.I.y.x1.x2.xm], let

[formula]

Let t*1 be the real number defined by

[formula]

and for each [formula], let [formula] be the real number defined inductively using [formula] by

[formula]

Moreover, let u be the real number depending on [formula] defined by

[formula]

Assume also that all of the following conditions hold:

[formula],

For each [formula],

[formula]

[formula],

For each [formula],

[formula]

Then we have [formula].

By condition C1 we have

[formula]

The following identities for partial derivatives hold:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Hence using Definition [\ref=definition.S.general.m] and ([\ref=ep1.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]), we obtain that

[formula]

Therefore if conditions C1 and C3 hold, then

[formula]

for each [formula] and [formula] in the region defined by ([\ref=condition1.general.region.t1.t2.tm]) and ([\ref=condition2.general.region.t1.t2.tm]).

Now we further assume that

[formula]

For [formula], by straightforward manipulations we also obtain the following identities for partial derivatives:

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Hence using Definition [\ref=definition.S.general.m] and ([\ref=ep1.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]), for [formula] we obtain that

[formula]

Now we also assume that for the real number u defined in the statement of the proposition we have

[formula]

where the maximum is over the region defined by the conditions ([\ref=condition1.general.region.t1.t2.tm]) and ([\ref=condition2.general.region.t1.t2.tm]). Later in this proof, we will show that the assumption ([\ref=ep5.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]) holds.

Using ([\ref=ep1.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]), ([\ref=ep4.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]), ([\ref=ep5.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]), and condition C2, as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=proposition.I.in.restricted.case.case.m.2], we obtain that for each [formula],

[formula]

holds for [formula] and the real numbers [formula] satisfying the conditions ([\ref=condition1.general.region.t1.t2.tm]) and ([\ref=condition2.general.region.t1.t2.tm]). This implies that for each [formula], [formula] assumes its maximum over the region defined by ([\ref=condition1.general.region.t1.t2.tm]) and ([\ref=condition2.general.region.t1.t2.tm]) on the closed set, forming a part of the boundary of the region, defined by the conditions

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] is defined in the statement of the proposition.

For each [formula], it follows from the definition of [formula] in the statement of the proposition that [formula] is the smallest value of the parameter [formula] over the closed set defined by the conditions ([\ref=ep6.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]) and ([\ref=ep7.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]). For each [formula], let [formula] be the point of the [formula]-space given by

[formula]

We observe that the points [formula] are the corners of the closed set given by ([\ref=ep6.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]) and ([\ref=ep7.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]).

For each [formula], the direction vector [formula] from [formula] to [formula] in the [formula]-space is

[formula]

Using ([\ref=e1.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]) we observe that for each [formula], the direction vector [formula] is parallel to the vector

[formula]

in the [formula]-space.

If for each [formula] the inequality

[formula]

for the standard inner product of vectors in the [formula]-space holds for each [formula] and [formula] satisfying ([\ref=ep6.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]) and ([\ref=ep7.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]), then [formula] is nondecreasing in the directions from Am to Am - 1, from Am - 1 to Am - 2, , and from A2 to A1. This implies that if ([\ref=ep9.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]) holds, then for each [formula], [formula] assumes its maximum at A1. Using ([\ref=ep8.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]), we obtain that ([\ref=ep9.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]) is equivalent to

[formula]

Using ([\ref=ep4.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]), ([\ref=ep10.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]), and some straightforward manipulations, we observe that ([\ref=ep9.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]) holds if

[formula]

Using the fact that [formula], the assumption ([\ref=ep5.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]), and condition C4, as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=proposition.I.in.restricted.case.case.m.2], we obtain that ([\ref=ep11.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]) holds, and hence for each [formula], [formula] assumes its maximum at A1.

Next we prove the claim ([\ref=ep5.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]). Note that the gradient of the m-variable function [formula] is [formula] at any point of the [formula]-space. For each [formula], from the standard inner product with the vector in ([\ref=ep8.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]) we obtain

[formula]

Then, as the function [formula], the function [formula] assumes its maximum at A1 and hence the claim ([\ref=ep5.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]) holds. Finally, using ([\ref=ep2.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]) we complete the proof under the assumption ([\ref=ep3.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]). As in the proof of Proposition [\ref=proposition.I.in.restricted.case.case.m.2], we observe that if the assumption ([\ref=ep3.general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute]) does not hold, but the assumptions of the proposition hold, then similar methods also apply and we again have [formula]. This completes the proof.

We note that Proposition [\ref=general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute] reduces to Proposition [\ref=proposition.I.in.restricted.case.case.m.2] and Corollary [\ref=corollary.I.in.restricted.case] if m = 2 and m = 1, respectively.

Asymptotic Bounds for Codes

In this section we prove our main results (Theorem [\ref=theorem.asymp] and Corollary [\ref=corollary.asym.linear]) which establish improved lower bounds on αq(δ) and αlinq(δ).

We first state our main assumption, which is like Assumption 1 in Section [\ref=section.asymptotic.size.V.m.case.m.1], but introduces more notation.

The following well-known result will be useful.

Under Assumption [formula] we have

[formula]

where hi is the class number of Fi.

This follows from [\cite=T] (see also [\cite=TV]).

Now we introduce an important function based on the function [formula] defined in Definition [\ref=general.definition.I.y.x1.x2.xm]. In the next definition we use the fact that [formula] is an increasing function on its domain of definition, see Lemma [\ref=general.lemma.I.increasing].

Under Assumption [formula] and for real numbers y > 0 and [formula] with [formula], let [formula] be the real-valued function of [formula] defined by

[formula]

where [formula].

Now we are ready to establish our main results. We recall that the functions αq(δ) and αlinq(δ) are defined in ([\ref=definition.alpha.q.delta]) and ([\ref=definition.alpha.linear.q.delta]), respectively.

Under Assumption [formula], let [formula] be real numbers with [formula]. For each real number [formula] we have

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula]. If σ = 0, then the theorem follows from [\cite=NO1]. If [formula], then the statement of the theorem is trivial. Therefore we can assume that σ > 0 and [formula]. Let 0  <  ε  <  σ be a real number such that

[formula]

For i  ≥  1, let

[formula]

For sufficiently large i, by Propositions [\ref=general.case.propostion.asymptotic.card.V.m] and [\ref=proposition.class.number.upper.bound], the hypotheses of Proposition [\ref=proposition.existence.G] for the global function field Fi with ri, si, and [formula] as in ([\ref=ep0.theorem.asymp]) are satisfied. Let Gi be the divisor of Fi given by Proposition [\ref=proposition.existence.G] with these parameters for sufficiently large i.

Note that

[formula]

(see [\cite=NO1]). Since we have ([\ref=ep-1.theorem.asymp]), using the divisor Gi of the global function field Fi for sufficiently large i, Theorem [\ref=theorem.basic], and ([\ref=ep1.theorem.asymp]), we obtain a sequence of q-ary codes {Ci}∞i = 1 of lengths {ni}∞i = 1, respectively, such that ni  →    ∞   as i  →    ∞   by Assumption [formula] as well as

[formula]

and

[formula]

Using the fact that αq(δ) is a nonincreasing function of δ, we get

[formula]

Letting ε  →  0+ completes the proof.

Under Assumption [formula], for each real number 0  <  δ  <  1 we have

[formula]

Taking m = 1 and using similar methods as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem.asymp], but applying Corollary [\ref=corollary.basic.linear] instead of Theorem [\ref=theorem.basic], we obtain the desired result.

Examples

In this section we demonstrate that Theorem [\ref=theorem.asymp] and Corollary [\ref=corollary.asym.linear] yield improvements on the lower bounds for αq(δ) and αlinq(δ) at least for certain values of q and certain values of δ. In our examples we use well-known values for γ  =  γ1 and take γl = 0 for l  ≥  2 for the parameters defined in Assumption [formula]. Nevertheless, we note that there is a potential for the demonstration of further improvements by Theorem [\ref=theorem.asymp] and Corollary [\ref=corollary.asym.linear] using γl  >  0 for l = 1 and some l  ≥  2 when q is not a square (the situation is different when q is a square, cf. [\cite=T]).

For simplicity of notation, for γ  =  γ1 and γl = 0 for l  ≥  2, we denote the lower bounds of Theorem [\ref=theorem.asymp] and Corollary [\ref=corollary.asym.linear] by [formula] and Rlinγ(δ), respectively. In the examples below, the required values of these two functions are computed by using Definition [\ref=definition.Psi] and Proposition [\ref=general.proposition.I.y.x1.x2.xm.compute].

Let RNO2,γ,x(δ) denote the lower bound in [\cite=NO2]. Moreover, let RlinX,γ(δ) denote Xing's lower bound for αlinq(δ) in [\cite=X1] (see also [\cite=NO2]).
