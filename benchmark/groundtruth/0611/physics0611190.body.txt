Comment on "Information Capacity of Optical Fiber Channels with Zero Average Dispersion"

It is an important problem, both theoretically and practically, to calculate or estimate the information capacity of a nonlinear channel. In a recent Letter [\cite=Turitsyn03prl] by Turitsyn et al., two models of noisy nonlinear fiber channels with zero average dispersion have been analyzed, and the spectral efficiency C is estimated to increase asymptotically as [formula] at high signal-to-noise ratio S / N, in sharp contrast to previous results that predict the channel capacity to peak and then fall off as signal power increases [\cite=Mitra01] [\cite=Tang01a] [\cite=Tang01b] [\cite=Narimanov02] [\cite=Green02opn]. While previous works relied on approximations, Ref.[\cite=Turitsyn03prl] used elegant field-theoretic formulations and techniques to analytically calculate the conditional probability density function, and rigorously derived a lower bound for the asymptotic channel capacity. However, the essential difference between Ref.[\cite=Turitsyn03prl] and previous works may not be in the mathematical approaches, rather, it may lie in subtle but crucial details of the physical models. In particular, the models in Ref.[\cite=Turitsyn03prl] incorporate no bandwidth-limiting mechanism during transmission or at the end of it, hence are limited in applicability to practical fiber channels, where such bandwidth-limiting mechanisms are always present to slow down the growth of channel capacity as signal power rises.

Although not explicitly stated, both models of Ref.[\cite=Turitsyn03prl] effectively assume spectral conservation of signal and noise within a band of width W, which is not (or yet to be) justified, and may not correctly reflect the actual physics of nonlinear channels. On one hand, no mathematical function or distribution of a signal is known to preserve its spectrum within a given frequency band when undergoing noisy nonlinear propagation. On the other hand, it has become an empirical law that nonlinearity in conjunction with noise always mix signals to generate new frequency components [\cite=Green02opn]. Solitons may be the closest to spectral preserving among known waveforms. But it is impractical to establish a single soliton channel utilizing the entire bandwidth of a fiber transmission line, while wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) solitons interact and mix with noise to generate out-of-band spectral components. Furthermore, soliton transmissions require fiber lines with nonzero average dispersion, which escape from the analytical solution [\cite=Turitsyn03prl]. Even frequency- or phase-modulated signals that might propagate undistorted under Kerr nonlinearity, the additive noise would cause intensity fluctuations and eventually spectral broadening. In conclusion, the physical models in Ref.[\cite=Turitsyn03prl] may not be suitable for practical fiber channels, and the question remains open whether the capacity could grow unbounded with increasing S / N for noisy, nonlinear, and bandlimited channels. A more realistic model may include distributed frequency filtering to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, in addition to distributive noise. But then the solvability of the channel and its capacity remain open problems.

Nevertheless, Ref.[\cite=Turitsyn03prl] has served greatly as a reminder to the trivial but often overlooked fact, that the capacity can never decrease as the permitted but not had to be reached bound of signal power increases. Falling off of capacity after peaking [\cite=Mitra01] [\cite=Tang01a] [\cite=Tang01b] [\cite=Narimanov02] [\cite=Green02opn] simply indicates inapplicability of either physical models or mathematical approximations. Ref.[\cite=Mitra01] considered a different problem where WDM channels are not demodulated or processed in a correlated manner. Ref.[\cite=Narimanov02] treated Kerr nonlinearity as perturbation, which naturally ceases to apply when the signal power is high. As well demonstrated [\cite=Turitsyn03prl], the use of Pinsker's formula as done in Refs.[\cite=Tang01a] and [\cite=Tang01b] is prone to error. The channel model of Ref.[\cite=Tang01a] for a single-span system assumes nonlinear but dispersionless propagation followed by noise addition at the end. In particular, frequency-dependent loss in the transmission fiber is neglected, so the channel bandwidth is only limited by the transmitter and receiver. The model admits a trivial argument of unbounded capacity. The Kerr nonlinearity in such channel becomes oblivious when constant-intensity modulations such as frequency- or phase-shift keying are used. Such particular modulations may not be best suitable to realize the ultimate capacity, but would definitely establish an asymptotic spectral efficiency of constant  ×   log 2(S / N) at high S / N, just as they do for a normal linear channel [\cite=Gibson93].
