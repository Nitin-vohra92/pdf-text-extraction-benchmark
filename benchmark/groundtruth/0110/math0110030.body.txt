Free Cumulants and Enumeration of Connected Partitions

Introduction

A partition of [formula] is called connected if no proper subinterval of

[formula]

for which 1 and n are in the same connected component. A partition is called noncrossing if its blocks do not intersect in their graphical representation, i.e., if there are no two distinct blocks B1 and B2 and elements a,c∈B1 and b,d∈B2 s.t. a < b < c < d. Equivalently one could say that a partition is noncrossing if each of its connected components consists of exactly one block. Typical examples of these types of partitions are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:Partitions].

We denote the lattice of partitions of

[formula]

Incidence algebras

Before recalling more facts about partitions, let us briefly introduce the main concepts about posets and incidence algebras which will be needed in the sequel. Rota et al.  [\cite=DoubiletRotaStanley:1972:foundationsVI] introduced the reduced incidence algebra of a poset. Let (P,  ≤  ) be a finite poset. On the space I(P) of complex-valued functions f(x,y) defined on the pairs (x,y) s.t. x  ≤  y ("triangular matrices") we introduce a convolution ("multiplication of triangular matrices") by

[formula]

With this operations I(P) becomes a unital algebra, the incidence algebra of the poset P, with identity

[formula]

It is clear by induction that a function is invertible under this convolution if and only if all the "diagonal" entries f(π,π) are nonzero. One prominent invertible function is the zeta-function defined by

[formula]

Its inverse is called the Möbius function and satisfies the recursion

[formula]

Then we have [formula] and more generally the Möbius inversion formula holds: for any pair of functions f(x) and g(x) on P we have the following equivalences

[formula]

In our case the posets P will be the partition lattice Πn and some of its sublattices, namely the lattice In of interval partitions and the lattice NCn of non-crossing partitions. Denote by Ln any one of these lattices, then every segment

[formula]

. The reduced incidence algebra is the algebra of functions whose values on an interval

[formula]

f(π,σ) = f f

Cumulants

Cumulants linearize convolution of probability measures coming from various notions of independence.

A non-commutative probability space is pair (A,φ) of a (complex) unital algebra A and a unital linear functional φ. The elements of A are called (non-commutative) random variables. The collection of moments μn(a)  =  φ(an) of such a random variable a∈A will be called its distribution and denoted μa  =  (μn(a))n.

Thus noncommutative probability theory follows the general "quantum" philosophy of replacing function algebras by noncommutative algebras. We will review several notions of independence below. Convolution is defined as follows. Let a and b be "independent" random variables. Then the convolution of the distributions of a and b is defined to be the distribution of the sum a + b. In all the examples below, the distribution of the sum of "independent" random variables only depends on the individual distributions of the summands and therefore convolution is well defined and the n-th moment μn(a + b) will be a polynomial function of the moments of a and b of order less or equal to n.

For our purposes it is sufficient to axiomatize cumulants as follows.

Given a notion of independence on a noncommutative probability space (A,φ), a sequence of maps a  ↦  kn(a), [formula] is called a cumulant sequence if it satisfies

kn(a) is a polynomial in the first n moments of a with leading term μn(a). This ensures that conversely the moments can be recovered from the cumulants.

homogenity: kn(λa)  =  λnkn(a).

additivity: if a and b are "independent" random variables, then kn(a + b) = kn(a) + kn(b).

Möbius inversion on the lattice of partitions plays a crucial role in the combinatorial approach to cumulants. We will need three kinds cumulants here, corresponding to classical, free and boolean independence, and which are connected to the three lattices of partitions considered in section [\ref=sec:intro]. Let X be a random variable with distribution ψ and moments [formula]

Classical cumulants

Let

[formula]

be the formal Laplace transform (or exponential moment generating function). Taking the formal logarithm we can write this series as

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the cumulant generating function and the numbers κn are called the (classical) cumulants of the random variable X.

Set partitions come in as follows. Let f and g be the multiplicative functions in the reduced incidence algebra of Πn determined by the sequence mn and κn respectively, then f = g * ζ and g = f * μ, i.e., if for a partition [formula] we put [formula] and [formula], then we can express moments and cumulants mutually as

[formula]

For example, the standard Gaussian distribution γ = N(0,1) has cumulants

[formula]

while the Poisson distribution Pλ (with weights [formula]) has cumulants κn(Pλ)  =  λ.

It follows that the even moments [formula] of the standard gaussian distribution count the number of pairings of a set with the corresponding number of elements.

On the other hand, the moments of a Poisson variable with parameter 1 are known as Bell numbers Bn and they are equal to the numbers of partitions of the finite sets with the corresponding cardinalities. The moment interpretation leads to Dobinski's formula (cf. [\cite=Rota:1964:number])

[formula]

Free Cumulants

Free cumulants were introduced by Speicher [\cite=Speicher:1994:multiplicative] in his combinatorial approach to Voiculescu's free probability theory [\cite=VoiculescuDykemaNica:1992:free]. Given our random variable X, let

[formula]

be its ordinary moment generating function. Define a formal power series

[formula]

implicitly by the equation

[formula]

Then the coefficients cn are called the free or non-crossing cumulants. The latter name stems from the fact that combinatorially these cumulants are obtained by Möbius inversion on the lattice of non-crossing partitions:

[formula]

Boolean cumulants

Boolean cumulants linearize boolean convolution [\cite=SpeicherWoroudi:1997:boolean] [\cite=vonWaldenfels:1973:approach] [\cite=vonWaldenfels:1975:interval]. Let again M(z) be the ordinary moment generating function of a random variable X defined by [\eqref=eq:ordinarymgf]. It can be written as

[formula]

where

[formula]

and the coefficients are called boolean cumulants. Combinatorially the connection between moments and boolean cumulants is described by Möbius inversion on the lattice of interval partitions:

[formula]

The term "boolean cumulants" is due to the fact that the lattice of interval partitions is anti-isomorphic to the boolean lattice of subsets of the same set with the first element removed. The isomorphism maps a partition to the set of first elements of its blocks, where clearly the first element of the first block is always the same and therefore redundant.

Enumeration of connected partitions

In this note we apply Möbius inversion to show that the free cumulants count connected partitions with certain weights given by the classical cumulants. The result is inspired by [\cite=Beissinger:1985:enumeration].

Let (mn) be a (formal) moment sequence with classical cumulants κn. Then the free cumulants of mn are equal to

[formula]

the boolean cumulants are equal to

[formula]

We consider only the identity [\eqref=eq:freeintermsofclassical], the proof of the others being similar (and also contained in the lattice path picture of [\cite=Lehner:2001:LatticePaths]). For σ∈Πn we denote by [formula] its noncrossing closure, that is the smallest noncrossing partition π s.t. σ  ≤  π. This noncrossing partition is obtained from σ by taking unions of all blocks which cross in the graphical representation like in the example depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:piandbarpi].

[formula]

→

For each [formula] define the number

[formula]

Now note that the preimage of [formula] is the set of all connected partitions, i.e.

[formula]

For general [formula] , by considering subpartitions induced by the blocks of π, we have multiplicativity [formula]. Now for [formula] we can collect terms as follows

[formula]

and by Möbius inversion [\eqref=eq:MoebiusinversionEquivalence:le] and [\eqref=eq:NCcumulantsMoebiusinversion] it follows that cπ  =  π.

The free cumulants of the standard gaussian variable are equal to the number of connected pairings.

[formula]

The free cumulants of the Poisson distribution with parameter 1 are equal to the number of connected partitions

[formula]

Moreover, if we leave the formal parameter λ, the expression for the n-th cumulants is the generating function of the numbers of blocks of the connected partitions.

[formula]

Similar identities hold for the q-Gaussian and q-Poisson laws [\cite=BozejkoKummererSpeicher:1997:qGaussian] [\cite=Nica:1995:qCumulants] where the free cumulants provide a generating function of the number of left-reduced crossings of the connected partitions. Alternatively, the free cumulants of the q-Poisson law of [\cite=Anshelevich"2001:qCumulants] [\cite=SaitohYoshida:2000:qPoissonOP] [\cite=SaitohYoshida:2000:qPoissonFock] count the number of reduced crossints, cf. [\cite=Biane:1997:properties]. In all these examples a continued fraction expansion of the moment generating function is known and the free cumulants can be expressed via Lagrange inversion.
