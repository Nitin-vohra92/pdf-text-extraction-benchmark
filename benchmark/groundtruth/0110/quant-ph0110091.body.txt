A note on Borromean correlations in multipartite quantum systems

A random vector [formula] of length N is said to be Borromean correlated if the distribution obtained by "forgetting" (or, speaking quantum, tracing out) any one of its components is a product one. As an example of such vector when all its components Ai are two-valued consider a classical register [formula] of N + 1 bits. Let each bit [formula]) takes independently its values 0 and 1 with probabilities pi and qi, respectively, while the 0-th bit contains the checksum of all the bits:

[formula]

Then

the set [formula] of random variables is not independent

any marginal distribution [formula] which appears when any bit [formula] of the register is traced out is a distribution of N independent variables.

In classical probability, for a random vector to be Borromean correlated, it should necessarily be in a mixed state. It is known that in quantum mechanics pure states still can give rise to random correlations (which are seen from outside as sharing a secret variable [\cite=classentang]), and one could expect that there exists such a pure quantum state, for which we can write an analog of Borromean correlations. It is shown in this note that no pure state of a multipartite quantum system can possess Borromean correlated density matrix.

I consider a composite quantum system [formula] consisting of N components [formula] each described by its state space [formula] each of which has dimension d. The overall state space H of [formula] is the tensor product

[formula]

Let [formula] be a density matrix of a state of of [formula]. I call it Borromean if for any [formula] its partially traced (with respect to the subsystem [formula]) density matrix is product:

[formula]

The message of this note is contained in the following

Statement.

Let [formula] be a pure state of the composite system [formula] such that its density matrix [formula] is Borromean [\eqref=edefborq]. Then the state [formula] is product.

Proof is essentially based on the generalised Scmidt decomposition introduced in [\cite=multschmidt]. Given a state [formula], one can always choose such a product basis [formula] in [formula] that in the decomposition

[formula]

the coefficients [formula] have the properties:

[formula]

Write down the density matrix

[formula]

and take its partial trace [formula] with respect to the subsystem [formula]. Then the matrix coefficients [formula] read:

[formula]

Since [formula] is assumed to be Borromean, the density matrix [formula] is product, that is, there is a set [formula] of [formula] density matrices in each Hi that

[formula]

If we set all [formula] then it follows from [\eqref=eprop1] that all the summands in [\eqref=errt] but one vanish, namely [formula], therefore from [\eqref=err1] we conclude that

[formula]

For any [formula], is > 1 it follows from [\eqref=eprop1] that all summands in [\eqref=errt] are 0, therefore we infer from [\eqref=err1] and [\eqref=eallg] that

[formula]

Furthermore, for any multi-index [formula] (ir excluded) we have

[formula]

if at least one is differs from 0. Now consider the right-hand side of the expansion [\eqref=errt] for this case. Again it follows from [\eqref=eprop1] that there is at most one non-zero summand in [\eqref=errt], that is:

[formula]

Since we can repeat our reasoning for any r, we have proved that for any multi-index [formula] (r now included) the coefficient [formula] in [\eqref=edecpsi] vanishes whenever at least one ir = 1 and at least one is > 1.

If [formula] then it follows from [\eqref=eprop2] that all the coefficients in [\eqref=edecpsi] are 0 and we are done: [formula] is a product state. So, suppose [formula]. In this case, applying [\eqref=eprop1] for i = 2 and repeating all the above reasoning we get that for any multi-index [formula] the coefficient [formula] in [\eqref=edecpsi] vanishes whenever at least one ir = 2 and at least one is > 2. Repeating the procedure up to d (the dimension of each Hs) we see that the only nonzero coefficients in the expansion [\eqref=edecpsi] are of the form [formula]. Now return to the formula [\eqref=errt] for the reduced density matrix. We see that its only non-vanishing elements are of the form [formula] which means that it is diagonal. Since [formula] is a pure state, [formula] and all others [formula], therefore [formula] is always a product state.

So, tracing out our pure state [formula] we get a pure product state. This, in turn, can happen only when the pure state [formula] is product itself.

Concluding remarks.

It was demonstrated that there are correlations in quantum systems which are of purely classical nature, that is, they can not be provided by any pure quantum state.

Note that the condition [\eqref=edefborq] for density matrices to be Borromean is stronger than its classical analogue. If we weaken the condition [\eqref=edefborq] and require the Borromean correlations not for the density matrix but only for a given fixed set of local observables, then it can be achieved by a pure quantum state. This can be shown by an example. Consider the following pure state of N + 1 qubits:

[formula]

then the expectation values of the collection of observables [formula] in each qubit has exactly the same distribution as shown the example [\eqref=eexborc].
