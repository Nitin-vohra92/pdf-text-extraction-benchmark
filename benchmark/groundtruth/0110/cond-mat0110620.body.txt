Pressure-Temperature Phase Diagram of Antiferromagnetism and Superconductivity in CeRhIn5 and CeIn3:115In-NQR Study under Pressure

It has been reported that a superconducting (SC) order in cerium (Ce)-based heavy-fermion (HF) compounds takes place nearby the border at which an antiferromagnetic (AF) order is suppressed by applying pressure (P) to the HF-AF compounds CeCu2Ge2,[\cite=CeCu2Ge2] CePd2Si2 [\cite=Mathur] and CeIn3 [\cite=Grosche]. The superconductivity in these compounds, however, occurs only in extreme conditions where the pressure exceeds ~   2 GPa and temperature (T) is cooled down below ~   1 K. Indeed the experiments were restricted mainly to transport measurements. The discovery of P-induced HF superconductors in Ce-based HF-AF compounds has stimulated further experimental works under P [\cite=Hegger] [\cite=Gegenwart] [\cite=Kawasaki] [\cite=Mito]. In order to gain profound insight into a relationship between magnetism and superconductivity in HF systems, systematic NMR/NQR experiments under P are important, since they can probe the evolution of the magnetic properties toward the onset of SC phase.

Recently, Hegger et al. found that a new HF material CeRhIn5 consisting of alternating layers of CeIn3 and RhIn2 reveals an AF-to-SC transition at a relatively lower critical pressure Pc = 1.63 GPa than in all previous examples [\cite=CeCu2Ge2] [\cite=Mathur] [\cite=Grosche]. The SC transition temperature Tc = 2.2 K is the highest one to date among P-induced superconductors [\cite=Hegger]. This finding has opened a way to investigate the P-induced evolution of both magnetic and SC properties over a wide P range. In the previous paper [\cite=Mito], the 115In NQR study of CeRhIn5 has clarified the P-induced anomalous magnetism and unconventional superconductivity. In the AF region, the Néel temperature TN exhibits a moderate variation, while the internal field Hint at 115In(1) site in the CeIn3 plane due to the magnetic ordering is linearly reduced in P = 0 - 1.23 GPa, extrapolated to zero at P*  =  1.6  ±  0.1 GPa. This P* is comparable to Pc  =  1.63 GPa at which the SC signature appears [\cite=Hegger], which was indicative of a second-order like AF-to-SC transition rather than the first-order one suggested previously [\cite=Hegger]. At P = 2.1 GPa, it was found that the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1 / T1 reveals a T3 dependence below the SC transition temperature Tc, which shows the existence of line-nodes in the gap function [\cite=Mito]. It is, however, not yet clear how the electronic states change with P when the AF phase evolves into the SC phase.

On the other hand, CeIn3 crystallizes in the cubic AuCu3 structure and orders antiferromagnetically (TN = 10 K) at P = 0 with an ordering vector Q = (1/2,1/2,1/2) [\cite=Morin]. TN monotonically decreases with P and superconductivity appears below Tc  ~   0.2 K at a critical pressure Pc = 2.55 GPa, but the onset of the superconductivity was observed only by the resistivity measurement and is limited in a narrow P range of about 0.5 GPa [\cite=Mathur] [\cite=Grosche] [\cite=Walker]. The previous 115In-NQR result on CeIn3 revealed that the AF order disappears around P* = 2.44 GPa close to Pc and the Fermi-liquid behavior was observed below 10 K at P = 2.74 GPa [\cite=Kohori-2]. However, no SC transition was seen. Thus, the bulk nature of the P-induced SC state in CeIn3 has not been confirmed yet by other measurements than resistivity. This is in contrast with the case of CeRhIn5 where the bulk nature of the SC phase was fully established [\cite=Mito] which continues up to 8 GPa [\cite=Muramatsu].

Here we report new P - T phase diagrams for CeRhIn5 and CeIn3 obtained through 115In-T1 measurements and present a possible explanation for the different P dependence of the SC phase in the two compounds.

The single crystals of CeRhIn5 and CeIn3 were grown by the self-flux and Czochralski Method, respectively [\cite=Hegger] [\cite=Onuki], and were moderately crushed into grains in order to make rf pulses penetrate into samples easily. In a small piece of CeIn3, the zero resistance transition is confirmed in P = 2.2 - 2.8 GPa [\cite=Muramatsu] (see below for detail). At P = 2.45 GPa, Tc reaches a maximum of Tc = 0.19 K and its transition width is the sharpest, which is in accordance with the previous results [\cite=Mathur] [\cite=Grosche]. The T1 was measured at the transitions of 2 νQ (±  3 / 2  ↔    ±  5 / 2) and 3 νQ (±  5 / 2  ↔    ±  7 / 2) for 115In(1) site in CeRhIn5 and of 3 νQ in CeIn3, by the conventional saturation-recovery method. The hydrostatic pressure was applied by utilizing a BeCu piston-cylinder cell, filled with Daphne oil (7373) as a pressure-transmitting medium.

Fig.1a shows some typical data sets for the T dependence of 1/T1 in CeRhIn5 at P = 0.46, 1.23 and 1.6 GPa. In the high T region, it is notable that 1 / T1 becomes almost T-independent above the temperature marked as T*. This indicates that Ce-4f moment fluctuations are in a localized regime above T*. In such a regime, 1 / T1 is proportional to p2eff / Jex or ~  p2effW / J2cf in terms of a localized moment picture. Here peff is an effective paramagnetic local moment, Jex the RKKY exchange constant among 4f moments, Jcf the exchange constant between 4f moments and conduction-electron spin, and W is the bandwidth (BW) of conduction electrons. A progressive suppression in 1 / T1 with increasing P is considered as due to the reduction in peff and/or the enhancement of Jcf. It is known in HF systems that T* is scaled to the quasi-elastic linewidth in neutron-scattering spectrum, leading to a tentative estimation of the BW of HF state. In CeRhIn5, therefore, the incommensurate spiral order with a staggered moment of 0.267 μB occurs in an itinerant magnetic regime at P = 0 [\cite=Bao-2]. As seen in Fig.1a, T* increases progressively with T* = 16, 23 and 27 K at P = 0.46, 1.23 and 1.6 GPa, respectively. Since the application of P further increases the hybridization between Ce-4f state and conduction electrons, Jcf, Jex, T* and BW are increased, whereas the size of the ordered moments is reduced. In this case, one could expect that the slight increase in [formula] with increasing pressure is due to the enhancement of Jex(P) which overcomes a possible reduction in peff.

In order to focus on the itinerant magnetic regime in T  <  T*, the T dependence of 1 / T1T below 10 K is shown in Fig.1b for P = 1.23 and 1.6 GPa. Above TN, it is clearly seen that 1 / T1T shows a broad peak at TPG. This resembles the pseudogap behavior found in the high-Tc copper oxide superconductors [\cite=Timusk]. Namely, when P approaches the critical pressures P* or Pc, the low-energy spectral weight of magnetic fluctuations is suppressed before an ordering occurs. This is the first observation of the pseudogap behavior in a magnetic region close to the SC phase. We note that the pseudogap behavior has been found in either two- or lower-dimensional strongly correlated electron systems [\cite=Timusk]. Very recently, anisotropic 3D AF fluctuation was reported from neutron scattering with an energy scale of less than 1.7 meV for temperature as high as 3 Tc [\cite=Bao-2]. In fact, an anisotropic 3D character in the AF fluctuations has been revealed previously by NQR measurement in the related material CeIrIn5 that is a superconductor at P = 0 [\cite=Zheng]. Thus the observation of the pseudogap behavior is consistent with the system bearing a magnetic character of reduced dimensionality at low pressures. On the other hand, when the pressure is further increased, at P = 2.1 GPa where the bulk SC transition appears, for example, 1 / T1T continues to increase down to Tc = 2.2 K without any signature for the pseudogap behavior [\cite=Mito]. The T variation of 1 / T1T is consistent with the three dimensional (3D) AF Fermi-liquid model of the self-consistent renormalized (SCR) theory for nearly AF metals [\cite=Moriya]. Thus an evolution in the magnetic fluctuations, from a magnetic regime of reduced dimensionality to a more isotropic one, may take place in a narrow P window of 1.2 - 2.1 GPa when the magnetic order evolves into the SC order.

Next we deal with the results in CeIn3. Fig.2a represents the T dependence of 1 / T1 in CeIn3 at P = 0, 1.42, 2.35 and 2.65 GPa. It is seen clearly that the T and P dependencies of 1 / T1 differ from CeRhIn5. 1 / T1 above TN is nearly T-independent at P = 0. At P = 1.42 GPa, 1 / T1 even increases upon cooling. Thus, the localized magnetic character in the paramagnetic state is robust against the application of P in CeIn3. In the high pressure regime where the SC sets in, there seems to appear an itinerant regime below T*  ~   10 K. T* eventually reaches ~   30 K at P = 2.65 GPa. Fig.2b indicates the T dependence of 1 / T1T. For all pressures, 1 / T1T increases down to TN, giving no indication for the pseudogap behavior. At P = 2.35 GPa where the zero resistance is observed, it has been confirmed, for the first time, that the magnetically ordering survives with a relatively high value of TN = 5 K. The SC transition is, however, not found by the high-frequency ac susceptibility measurement down to 100 mK using the in-situ NQR coil, despite that a zero resistance was observed in the same sample at Tc  ~   0.15 K. From the present experiments, we conclude that the P - T phase diagram and the nature of the SC phase in CeIn3 differs from in CeRhIn5, in many aspects, reflecting their contrasting electronic and magnetic properties; we speculate that the SC phase in CeIn3 that accompanies the Meissner diamagnetism, if any, is even narrower than suggested by the resistivity measurement.

The P - T phase diagrams for CeRhIn5 and CeIn3 are summarized in Fig.3. For CeRhIn5, T* slightly increases with increasing P up to 1.0 GPa, as does TN which coincides with the previous result [\cite=Hegger]. However, TN decreases above P = 1.23 GPa. At the same time, a pseudogap behavior emerges below TPG  ~  5.5 K. As P is further increased, T* moderately increases with dT* / dP  ~   8 K/GPa. It is noted that T* is comparale to the temperature Tmax,ρ at which the resistivity exhibits a maximum value and also dT* / dP  ~  dTmax,ρ / dP [\cite=Hegger]. We remark that T* and dT* / dP are also close to those in CeCu2Si2 [\cite=Kawasaki] which is a superconductor at P = 0 and reveals a SC state over a wide P region as well [\cite=Thomas]. In CeRhIn5, the anisotropic 3D AF fluctuations may survive until the system is close to the SC state, where the pseudogap behavior is emergent. Above P* or Pc where the bulk superconductivity appears, the AF spin correlations become more isotropic and the T dependence of 1/T1T for T  >  Tc can be explained on the basis of the 3D SCR theory for nearly AF metals [\cite=Mito]. While the isotropic AF fluctuation regime is fully established, the bulk SC is insensitive against P. In CeIn3, by contrary, T* steeply increases above P = 1.9 GPa, indicating an evolution of the system into an itinerant magnetic regime. It is interesting that the SC state becomes emergent in such a regime. Close to Pc, the normal state resistivity, ρ in CeIn3 at low T is also consistent with the 3D AF fluctuations model of itinerant magnetic regime [\cite=Grosche]. However, when the pressure is further increased above Pc, a Fermi-liquid behavior of the resistivity returns more rapidly in CeIn3 than in CeRhIn5 and CeCu2Si2 [\cite=Grosche]. This is also corroborated by the observation of T1T = constant behavior at P = 2.65 GPa in CeIn3. Thus the window of the 3D AF fluctuation regime is much narrower in CeIn3. We propose that the narrow SC region in CeIn3 is due to the small window for the 3D AF fluctuation regime because of its large rate of dT* / dP. This small window for the 3D AF fluctuation regime against P in CeIn3 may be related to its cubic crystal structure which is more sensitive to external P than a tetragonal structure.

Based on magnetically-mediated SC theoretical models [\cite=Model], it is predicted that 2D AF fluctuations are superior to 3D fluctuations in producing SC [\cite=Monthoux]. Therefore, the enhancement of Tc in layered CeMIn5 over CeIn3 has been suggested to be due to their quasi-2D structure [\cite=Hegger] [\cite=Cornelius] [\cite=Petrovic]. Our results suggest that the small window for the spin fluctuations regime in CeIn3 may also be partly responsible for its lower Tc .

In conclusion, on the basis of the 115In-NQR T1 measurement, we have reported the P-induced evolution of the electronic and magnetic characteristics when approaching the SC phase in CeRhIn5 and entering the SC phase in CeIn3. In CeRhIn5 that is already in the itinerant magnetic regime at P = 0, TN slightly increases with P at lower pressures which is in accordance with previous report [\cite=Hegger]. However, TN starts to decrease above P = 1.23 GPa approaching the critical value at which SC sets in. At the same time, a pseudogap behavior emerges. By contrast, in CeIn3, the localized magnetic character is robust against the application of P up to 1.9 GPa, beyond which T*, which marks an evolution into an itinerant magnetic regime, increases rapidly. It is interesting that the SC emerges in such an itinerant regime. The window for the 3D AF fluctuation regime with respect to external pressure is much narrower in CeIn3 than in CeRhIn5, which may also be partly responsible for its lower Tc in CeIn3.
