In superstring theory [\cite=Polchinski], it is well known that there are various flat directions parameterized by scalar fields. (Hereafter, we call these fields as "moduli" fields.) Since their potential is usually generated by effects of supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking, their masses are expected to be of the order of the gravitino mass. Although masses of the moduli fields can be as light as (or even lighter than) the electroweak scale, moduli fields do not affect collider experiments since their interactions are suppressed by inverse powers of the gravitational scale.

Cosmologically, however, they may cause serious problems [\cite=PRL131-59]. Since the modulus field φ is a scalar field, its primordial amplitude may be displaced from the minimum of the potential, and this is naturally the case unless the minimum of the potential is protected by some symmetry [\cite=DinRanTho]. If such a displacement exists, then the modulus field starts to oscillate at later stage of the universe and dominates the energy density of the universe. Since the interaction of the modulus field is expected to be suppressed by inverse powers of the gravitational scale, its decay width is at most

[formula]

where mφ is the mass of the modulus field and M*≃2.4  ×  1018 GeV is the reduced Planck scale. Using Eq.  ([\ref=gamma_phi]), φ decays before the present epoch if [formula]. In this case, the reheating temperature is estimated as [\cite=KolTur]

[formula]

where g* is the effective number of the massless degrees of freedom, and hence reheating temperature becomes lower than ~  1 MeV if [formula]. With such a low reheating temperature, the great success of the standard big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) is spoiled. For lighter moduli fields ([formula]), they survive until today and overclose the universe. Thus, the cosmological moduli fields cause extremely serious problems in cosmology.

One solution to these difficulties is to push up the mass of the moduli fields [\cite=Heavyphi]. In particular, in Ref. [\cite=NPB570-455], it was pointed out that the scenario with heavy moduli can naturally fit into the framework of the anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking [\cite=AMSB]. Indeed, according to Eq. ([\ref=T_R]), the reheating temperature can be higher than ~  1 MeV if [formula]. In this case, the BBN occurs after the decay of the modulus field. In this letter, we consider this scenario and study its consequence in the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

Although, in the case with the modulus field, the thermal history after the BBN is mostly the same as the standard one, cosmology before the modulus decay is completely different. In particular, it should be noted that the CMB we observe today is from the decay of the modulus field while, in the conventional case, it is from the decay of the inflaton. Importantly, non-adiabatic fluctuation may be imprinted in the initial amplitude of the modulus field during the inflation, and we may observe a non-standard signal in the CMB angular power spectrum. Indeed, as we will see below, correlated mixture of adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations may be induced, which results in enhanced CMB angular power spectrum at higher multipoles relative to that of lower ones. For other mechanism of generating correlated mixiture of adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations, see [\cite=adi-iso].

To understand the effect of the cosmological modulus field, let us follow the evolution of the modulus field from the epoch of the inflation. During the inflation, quantum fluctuation of the inflaton field generates the source of the adiabatic perturbation. Such an effect is well parameterized by the gauge-invariant potential Ψ, which is related to the perturbed line element in the Newtonian gauge:

[formula]

where a is the scale factor. (We use the notation of Ref.  [\cite=HuThesis].) Denoting Ψ induced during the inflation as Ψi, we obtain [\cite=PRD28-629]

[formula]

where k is the comoving momentum, χ is the inflaton field, the "dot" is the derivative with respect to time t, and H inf is the expansion rate during the inflation. (Hereafter, the "tilde" is used for Fourier components of the correlation function with the measure [formula]. For example, Ψ̃(k) is defined as [formula].) If there is no modulus field, this is the only source of the cosmic density fluctuation. However, if the modulus field exists, its amplitude may also fluctuate, which can be a source of the density fluctuation. If the mass of the modulus is negligibly small relative to the expansion rate during the inflation, If the mass of the modulus is comparable to or larger than H inf, δφ̃ becomes negligibly small and the resultant CMB power spectrum is completely the same as the conventional adiabatic case. Therefore, we do not consider such a case. we obtain

[formula]

Hereafter, we assume that the initial amplitude of the modulus field is large enough so that we can treat δφ̃ as a perturbation. Importantly, two fluctuations Ψ̃i and δφ̃i are uncorrelated and hence we can study their effects separately. Effects of Ψ̃i have been intensively studied [\cite=HuThesis], and hereafter, we concentrate on effects of δφ̃i.

After inflation, inflaton field starts to oscillate and then decays. Then, the universe is reheated and the radiation dominated universe is realized. (We call this epoch as "RD1" epoch.) During this epoch, the unperturbed modulus amplitude [formula] and the perturbation in φ, denoted as δφ, obey the following equations of motion:

[formula]

where H is the expansion rate of the universe, V(φ) is the potential of φ, and the "prime" is the derivative with respect to φ. Since the modes we are interested in are at the superhorizon scale during the RD1 epoch, we neglect the k-dependent term in Eq. ([\ref=Eq-dphi]) in the following discussion. In addition, we adopt the simplest potential for the modulus field:

[formula]

With this potential, notice that, in the long wavelength limit (i.e., k  →  0), [formula] and δφ̃ obey the same equation if we neglect the gravitational potential Ψ.

It is instructive to discuss qualitative behaviors of [formula] and δφ̃. When H  ≫  mφ, [formula] and δφ̃ both stay constant. As the universe expands, however, the expansion rate decreases and H becomes comparable to mφ at some point. Then, [formula] and δφ̃ both start to oscillate. We assume that the reheating temperature after the inflation is high enough so that the modulus field starts to oscillate in the radiation dominated universe. We also assume that the initial amplitude of the modulus field i is smaller than ~  M*; if this condition is satisfied, the energy density of the modulus field is smaller than that of radiation when H  ~  mφ is satisfied.

Once the modulus field starts to oscillate, equation of state for φ becomes ωφ  →  0 and φ behaves as a non-relativistic matter. Therefore, the situation is like the conventional system with radiation and cold dark matter (CDM) components with primordial isocurvature perturbation in the CDM sector. In particular, notice that the energy density of the modulus is proportional to a- 3, and hence the energy density of the modulus takes over that of radiation as the universe expands even though initially ργ  ≫  ρφ, where ργ and ρφ are energy densities of the radiation and modulus field, respectively. Therefore, at some point, the energy density of the universe is dominated by that of the modulus field. (We call this epoch as "modulus dominated" or "φD" epoch.)

To study this system, it is convenient to define the entropy between the modulus and the radiation:

[formula]

where δργ and δρφ are fluctuations in ργ and ρφ, respectively. Since Sφγ is independent of time when ωφ becomes 0, we need to know its initial value. For this purpose, it is convenient to use the fact that, for a given (t) which is a solution to Eq. ([\ref=Eq-phi]), δφ̃ is given by

[formula]

where we used an approximation that Ψ is a constant, which is a good approximation in the radiation dominated universe. In addition, δφ̃i is the initial value of δφ̃ which is given in Eq. ([\ref=dphi_i]). We identify the first and second terms as isocurvature and adiabatic fluctuations in the modulus amplitude, respectively. Indeed, with the second term (with relevant perturbation in the radiation sector to generate Ψ̃i), Sφγ vanishes. On the contrary, with the first term, Sφγ is given by

[formula]

Notice that, if δφ̃i is independent of k, S̃i is also independent of k.

We numerically followed the evolution of Ψ̃(δφ) from the RD1 to the modulus dominated epoch. In Fig. [\ref=fig:psi], we plot the evolution of the gravitational potential as a function of the scale factor a. Notice that, for the line (A) (line (B)), the epochs with [formula] and [formula] ([formula] and [formula]) correspond to the RD1 and modulus dominated epochs, respectively. It is interesting to compare cases with different values of i. As i decreases, the modulus dominated universe is realized at later stage, as seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:psi]. However, the resultant value of the ratio Ψ̃(δφ)  /  S̃i is independent of i and is always - 0.2. We also checked that the result is independent of k as far as we consider fluctuations at the superhorizon scale [\cite=iso2adi].

Behavior of Ψ̃(δφ) given in Fig. [\ref=fig:psi] can be understood by denoting that the evolution of the density fluctuations in this case is exactly like the conventional isocurvature case. When the universe is radiation dominated, Ψ̃(δφ) is proportional to a. On the other hand, once the universe is dominated by the non-relativistic matter (i.e., the modulus field), Ψ becomes the constant. Ψ at the modulus dominated epoch is related to S̃i as

[formula]

where the suffix (δφ) means that this quantity is induced by δφi. The relation ([\ref=Psi(phi-D)]) holds until the modulus field decays.

When the expansion rate of the universe becomes comparable to the decay rate of φ, the modulus field decays and energy density stored in the modulus sector is transferred to that of radiation. Then, a radiation dominated universe is again realized. (We call this epoch as "RD2" epoch.) When φ decays, the density fluctuation in the modulus sector is also transferred to the radiation. This results in a change in Ψ̃: with the decay, the equation of state of the dominant component of the universe changes from 0 to 1 / 3, and Ψ̃ varies by the factor of 10 / 9:

[formula]

After the decay of the modulus field, we assume that scenario of the standard cosmology (like the neutrino decoupling, standard BBN, recombination, and so on) follows.

Now, we are at the position to discuss the CMB angular power spectrum from the scenario with the modulus field. First, we should emphasize that there are two independent sources of the CMB anisotropy, i.e., Ψ̃i and δφ̃i. Therefore, the resultant CMB angular power spectrum is given in the following form:

[formula]

Here, C(adi)l is from the perturbation in the inflaton field, which is of order Ψ̃2i. On the contrary, C(δφ)l is from the primordial fluctuation of the modulus amplitude, which is of order δφ̃2i. (Notice that there is no term which is of order Ψ̃iδφ̃i, since two fluctuations are uncorrelated.) C(adi)l can be calculated by following the standard method.

In calculating C(δφ)l, we must specify the origin of the CDM and baryon. Here, we assume that the CDM is generated by the decay of the modulus field. (For example, if the lightest superparticle (LSP) is stable, decay of the modulus field may generate right amount of the LSP for the CDM [\cite=NPB570-455].) In this case, after the decay of the modulus field, there is no entropy between the CDM and radiation.

On the contrary, origin of the baryon asymmetry is more controversial. Here, we consider two possibilities: (i) the baryon asymmetry is (somehow) generated at the time of (or after) the decay of the modulus field, or (ii) the Affleck-Dine (AD) mechanism [\cite=NPB249-361] generates the baryon number much before the decay of the modulus field.

Let us first consider the case where the baryon number is generated by the decay of the modulus field. In this case, there is no entropy between the baryon and the radiation, so the cosmic fluctuations are exactly like the conventional adiabatic case once the modulus field decays. Thus, if we neglect the scale dependences of Ψ̃i and δφ̃i, C(δφ)l is proportional to C(adi)l. Therefore, in this case, the CMB angular power spectrum is the same as the usual adiabatic case if the normalization of the initial fluctuations are properly chosen. However, this fact has significant implications when we construct a model of inflation. First of all, since Ψ̃(δφ)  ~  O(H inf  /  i), we may generate large cosmic perturbation by lowering i even if H inf is small. Furthermore, usually, scale dependence of δφ̃i is milder than that of Ψ̃i. Consequently, when C(adi)l  ≪  C(δφ)l is realized, the resultant CMB angular power spectrum may be like that from the scale-invariant adiabatic perturbation even if Ψ̃i has a strong scale dependence. These facts relax constraints on the potential of the inflaton field. For example, this scenario provides an interesting mechanism to lower the scale of inflation (i.e., H inf).

Now we consider the case where the baryon asymmetry is due to the AD mechanism. In this case, the amplitude of the AD field may fluctuate and it can provide a new source of the cosmic perturbations. In general, perturbation in the AD field may be generated during the inflation, which is H inf / 2π if the effective mass of the AD field during inflation is much smaller than H inf. If such a fluctuation exists, it becomes a source of an uncorrelated isocurvature perturbation in the baryonic sector. To make our point clearer, we assume that the initial value of the fluctuation in the AD field is negligibly small. This may happen when, for example, the effective mass of the AD field is comparable to H inf during the inflation. It should be also noted that, if the initial amplitude of the AD field is much larger than i, effects of the fluctuations in the AD field becomes also negligible. (Effects of the fluctuations in the AD field will be discussed elsewhere [\cite=MTinProgress].)

Even when there is no primordial fluctuation in the AD field, however, non-vanishing isocurvature fluctuation is eventually generated in the baryonic sector if δφ̃i  ≠  0. If we calculate the entropy between the baryon and φ before the decay of the modulus field, we obtain

[formula]

where we have used the fact that δb  →  0 as a  →  0. This entropy is conserved until the modulus field decays, and it becomes the entropy between the photon and baryon after the decay of the modulus field. Therefore, in calculating C(δφ)l which is generated by the primordial fluctuation in the modulus amplitude, initial condition for the baryonic density fluctuation is different from the conventional adiabatic case, and is given by, in deep radiation dominated epoch,

[formula]

Notice that the first term in the right-handed side of the above equation does not exist in the usual adiabatic ones. Initial conditions for other perturbations are the same as the usual adiabatic case. The first term in Eq. ([\ref=db_i]) gives rise to the non-vanishing entropy in the baryonic sector and hence we call it as the "isocurvature" term. Here, it should be emphasized that such an isocurvature fluctuation is correlated with the contribution from Ψ̃(δφ)RD2 which gives rise to the effect like the conventional adiabatic fluctuation. Thus, the effect of this "isocurvature" fluctuation is completely different from the conventional uncorrelated isocurvature fluctuation and, as we will see below, its effect may be observable in future satellite experiments.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:comparison], we show C(δφ)l for the case with the correlated isocurvature perturbation in the baryonic sector. For comparison, we also plot the angular power spectra with purely adiabatic perturbation and with purely baryonic isocurvature perturbation. As we can see, C(δφ)l is completely different from other two cases; for the case with correlated isocurvature perturbation, the CMB angular power spectrum at higher multipoles is enhanced relative to that for the lower ones compared to other cases [\cite=PRD62-043504]. Thus, if the total angular power spectrum has some contamination of C(δφ)l, Cl at higher multipoles is enhanced relative to that at lower ones. Notice that such a signal is distinguishable from that with uncorrelated isocurvature perturbation, and that it may provide an interesting evidence of the cosmological moduli fields.

Now, we show the total CMB angular power spectrum with such a correlated isocurvature fluctuation in the baryonic density fluctuation. Since there are two sources of the cosmic perturbations, Ψi and Si (or equivalently, δφi), we define For simplicity, we neglect the scale dependence of R.

[formula]

where Ψ(adi)RD2 is the gravitational potential in the adiabatic mode during the RD2 epoch, which is related to Ψi as

[formula]

For the case of i  ~  M*, R is expected to be O(1) when Ψ̃i  ~  O(H inf / M*), which is the case in, for example, the chaotic inflation models. However, in general, R can be much larger or smaller than 1 depending on the model of the inflation as well as on i, and hence we treat R as a free parameter.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:C_l], we plot the total CMB angular power spectrum for several values of R. Here (and in the following analysis), the overall normalization of Cl is determined such that the goodness-of-fit parameter χ2 =  - 2 ln L, where L is the likelihood function, is minimized. In our analysis, following Ref.  [\cite=APJ533-19], the offset lognormal approximation is used. In addition, we take account of the data from COBE [\cite=cobe], BOOMERanG [\cite=boomerang], MAXIMA [\cite=maxima], and DASI [\cite=dasi]. For our numerical analysis, we use RADPACK package [\cite=radpack] to calculate χ2, which is based on 24, 19, 13, and 9 band powers from COBE, BOOMERanG, MAXIMA, and DASI, respectively. For the BOOMERanG and MAXIMA data, the cross-correlations between the band powers are not included in our analysis since they are not available. As one can see, correlated isocurvature perturbation in the baryonic sector may result in an enhancement of Cl at higher multipoles relative to that at lower ones. Therefore, future satellite experiment will give us interesting tests of the scenario with the cosmological moduli fields.

In fact, even the existing data for the CMB power spectrum provides a constraint on the parameter R. Since Cl at higher multipoles becomes larger as R increases, too large R is excluded. In Fig.  [\ref=fig:chi^2], we plot the χ2 variable as a function of R, where we take Ωbh2 = 0.019, and several values of h and Ωm. As one can see, the value of χ2 is sensitive to the cosmological parameters since the heights and locations of the acoustic peaks depend on them. For example, taking (h,Ωbh2,Ωm) = (0.65,0.019,0.3), which results in the most conservative upper bound on R among the data sets used in Fig.  [\ref=fig:chi^2], and requiring χ2  ≤  84, which gives 95 % C.L. allowed region for the χ2 statistics with 64 degrees of freedom, we obtain the constraint R  ≤  4.5. Thus, we can exclude the case where the CMB anisotropy is purely from the primordial fluctuation in the modulus amplitude (i.e., the case of R  →    ∞  ).

In summary, we have studied the effects of the cosmological moduli fields on the CMB anisotropy. Importantly, if a cosmological modulus field exists, it may significantly affect the CMB. In particular, in the scenario with the cosmological moduli fields, correlated isocurvature fluctuation may exist in the baryonic sector which results in enhanced CMB angular power spectrum at higher multipoles relative to that at lower ones. Such an effect can be a striking signal from the cosmological moduli fields, and it may be observed in future satellite experiments. In addition, even in the case where there is no isocurvature perturbation, the cosmological modulus field may have important implication to the model-building of the inflation; it may relax constraints on the inflaton potential. In particular, the cosmological modulus field provides an interesting possibility to lower the scale of the inflation adopting smaller value of the initial amplitude of the modulus field. In fact, similar mechanism of changing the constraints on the inflaton potential may work with the AD field; in this case the baryon asymmetry is from the decay of the AD field and the correlated isocurvature perturbation in the baryonic sector is absent. More detailed discussion in this case will be given elsewhere [\cite=MTinProgress].
