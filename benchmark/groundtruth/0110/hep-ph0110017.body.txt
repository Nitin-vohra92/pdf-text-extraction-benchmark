B  →  τ+τ-γ decay in the general two Higgs doublet model including the neutral Higgs boson effects

and     G. Turan

Introduction

Rare B-meson decays are induced by the flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) and they occur only through electroweak loops in the standard model (SM). Thus, on the one hand, they provide fertile testing ground for the SM and on the other hand, they offer a complementary strategy for constraining new physics beyond the SM, such as the two Higgs doublet model (2HDM), minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM [\cite=Hewett], ect. From the experimental point of view, studying rare B meson decays can provide essential information about the poorly known parameters of the SM, like the elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, the leptonic decay constants etc.

In this work, we study the radiative B  →  τ+τ-γ decay in the general two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM). It is induced by the pure-leptonic decay B  →  τ+τ- and in principle, the latter can be used to determine the decay constant fB [\cite=Buchalla], as well as the fundamental parameters of the SM. However, it is well known that processes [formula] are helicity suppressed for light lepton modes, having branching ratios of the order of 10- 9 for [formula] and 10- 10 for [formula] channels [\cite=Eilam1]. Although the B  →  τ+τ- channel is free from this suppression, its observation is difficult due to low efficiency. If a photon line is attached to any of the charged lines (see Fig.1), the pure leptonic processes [formula] change into the corresponding radiative ones, [formula], so helicity suppression is overcome and larger branching ratios are expected. Depending on whether the photon is released from the initial quark or final lepton lines, there exist two different types of contributions, namely the so-called "the structure dependent" (SD) and the "internal Bremsstrahlung" (IB) respectively, while contributions coming from the release of the free photon from any charged internal line will be suppressed by a factor of m2b / M2W. The SD contribution is governed by the vector and axial vector form factors and it is free from the helicity suppression. Therefore, it could enhance the decay rates of the radiative processes B  →  τ+τ-γ in comparison to the decay rates of the pure leptonic ones B  →  τ+τ-. As for the IB part of the contribution, it is proportional to the ratio [formula] and therefore it is still helicity suppressed for the light charged lepton modes while it enhances the amplitude considerably for [formula] mode. Indeed, [formula] decay have been investigated in the framework of the SM for light and heavy lepton modes [\cite=Eilam1]-[\cite=Aliev2], as well as in the models beyond the SM [\cite=Iltan1] [\cite=Aliev3], and it was found that in the SM [formula] [\cite=Aliev2], for [formula], respectively. With long distance contributions, BR(B  →  τ+τ-γ) = 1.52  ×  10- 8 was obtained [\cite=Aliev2]. In 2HDM, in contrast to the channels with light leptons, the channel B  →  τ+τ-γ receives additional contributions from the neutral Higgs boson (NHB) exchanges, in addition to SD and IB ones. In [\cite=Iltan1], B  →  τ+τ-γ decay is investigated in model I and II types of the 2HDM including NHB effects and shown that these effects are sizable when tan β is large. Our aim in this work is to study the sensitivity of the physically measurable quantities, such as branching ratio, photon energy density, forward-backward asymmetry of the final lepton and lepton polarization asymmetry, to the NHB effects, as well as to the model III parameters, like the Yukawa couplings DN,bb and DN,ττ.

The work is organized as follows. In section 2, after a brief summary about the main points of the general 2HDM, we first present the leading order (LO) QCD corrected effective Hamiltonian for the process b  →  sτ+τ-, including the NHB effects and then give the matrix element for the exclusive B  →  τ+τ-γ decay, together with the explicit expressions for the double differential decay width, photon energy distribution, forward-backward asymmetry and the polarization asymmetry of the final lepton τ-. Section 3 is devoted to the numerical analysis of the dependencies of these observables on the model III parameters and also on NHB effects. Finally, in the Appendix, we give the explicit forms of the operators appearing in the Hamiltonian and the corresponding Wilson coefficients.

The B  →  τ+τ-γ decay in the framework of the general 2HDM

The 2HDM is the minimal extension of the SM, which consists of adding a second doublet to the Higgs sector. In this model, there are one charged Higgs scalar, two neutral Higgs scalars and one neutral Higgs pseudoscalar. The general Yukawa Lagrangian, which is responsible for the interactions of quarks with gauge bosons, can be written as

[formula]

where i,j are family indices of quarks , L and R denote chiral projections L(R) = 1 / 2(1  ∓  γ5), φm for m = 1,2, are the two scalar doublets, QiL are quark doublets, UjR, DjR are the corresponding quark singlets, ηU,Dij and ξU,Dij are the matrices of the Yukawa couplings. The Yukawa Lagrangian in Eq. ([\ref=lagrangian]) opens up the possibility that there appear tree-level FCNC. In the SM and in model I and model II types of the 2HDM, such FCNC at tree level are forbidden by the GIM mechanism [\cite=GIM] and by an ad hoc discrete symmetry [\cite=Glashow], respectively. However, tree-level FCNC are permitted in the general 2HDM, and this type of 2HDM is referred to as model III in the literature.

In this model, it is possible to choose φ1 and φ2 in the following form

[formula]

with the vacuum expectation values,

[formula]

With this choice, the SM particles can be collected in the first doublet and the new particles in the second one. Further, we take H1, H2 as the mass eigenstates h0, A0 respectively. Note that, at tree level, there is no mixing among CP even neutral Higgs bosons, namely the SM one, H0, and beyond, h0.

The part which produces FCNC at tree level is

[formula]

In Eq.([\ref=lagrangianFC]), the couplings ξU,D for the flavor-changing charged interactions are

[formula]

where ξU,Dneutral is defined by the expression

[formula]

and ξU,Dneutral is denoted as ξU,DN. Here the charged couplings are the linear combinations of neutral couplings multiplied by VCKM matrix elements (see [\cite=Aliev4] for details).

After this brief summary about the general 2HDM, now we would like to present the calculation of the matrix element for the B  →  τ+τ-γ decay . For a general investigation of the B  →  τ+τ-γ decay, we start with the LO QCD corrected effective Hamiltonian which induces the corresponding quark level process b  →  s  τ+τ-, given by [\cite=Dai]

[formula]

where Oi are current-current (i = 1,2), penguin (i = 1,..,6), magnetic penguin (i = 7,8) and semileptonic (i = 9,10) operators . The additional operators Qi,(i = 1,..,10) are due to the NHB exchange diagrams, which give considerable contributions in the case that the lepton pair is τ+τ- [\cite=Dai]. Ci(μ) and CQi(μ) are Wilson coefficients renormalized at the scale μ. All these operators and the Wilson coefficients, together with their initial values calculated at μ = mW in the SM and also the additional coefficients coming from the new Higgs scalars are presented in Appendix A.

The short distance contributions for B  →  τ+τ-γ decay come from the box, Z and photon penguin diagrams, which are obtained from the diagrams of Fig. ([\ref=feyndia]) by attaching an additional photon line either to the initial quark lines that contribute to the SD part of the amplitude, or to the final lepton lines, which give the so-called IB part of the amplitude. Following this framework, the general form of the gauge invariant amplitude corresponding to Fig.([\ref=feyndia]) can be written as the sum of the SD and IB parts

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

where

[formula]

In Eqs. ([\ref=Msd]) and ([\ref=Mib]), [formula] and kμ are the four vector polarization and four momentum of the photon, respectively, q is the momentum transfer and pB is the momentum of the B meson. The form factors g, f, g1, f1and fB are defined as follows [\cite=Aliev1] [\cite=Eilam2]:

[formula]

[formula]

In obtaining the expressions ([\ref=Msd]) and ([\ref=Mib]), we have also used

[formula]

and conservation of the vector current. Note that in contrast to MSD part of the amplitude, its MIB part receives contributions from NHB exchange diagrams, which are represented by the factors F and F1 in Eq. ([\ref=Mib]). During the calculations of these NHB contributions in model III, we encountered logarithmic divergences and used the on-shell renormalization scheme to overcome them. (For details, see [\cite=Ergur]).

We now examine the probability of the process B  →  τ+τ-γ as a function of the four momenta of the particles. In the center of mass (CM) frame of the dileptons τ+τ-, where we take z =  cos θ and θ is the angle between the momentum of the B-meson and that of τ-, double differential decay width is found to be

[formula]

with

[formula]

where x = 2Eγ / mB is the dimensionless photon energy and [formula] with r = m2τ / m2B. After some calculation, we get for the different parts of the squared matrix elements in Eq. ([\ref=M2]) :

[formula]

[formula]

There is a singularity in [formula] at the lower limit of the photon energy due to the soft photon emission from charged lepton line, while [formula] and Re(MSDM*IB) terms are free from this singularity. It has been shown that when processes B  →  τ+τ-γ and B  →  τ+τ- are considered together, the singular terms in [formula] exactly cancel the O(α) virtual correction in B  →  τ+τ- amplitude. But instead of this approach we prefer the one used in ref.[\cite=Aliev2] which amounts to impose a cut on the photon energy, i.e., we require Eγ  ≥  50   MeV. This restriction means that we only consider the hard photons in the process B  →  τ+τ-γ. Therefore, the Dalitz boundary for the dimensionless photon energy is taken as

[formula]

with δ = 0.01.

Using Eqs. ([\ref=dGdxdz])-([\ref=Mib2]), we get the following result for the double differential decay width

[formula]

Integrating the angle variable, we find the photon energy distribution given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

We also give the forward-backward asymmetry, AFB, in B  →  τ+τ-γ. Using the definition of differential AFB

[formula]

we find

[formula]

where

[formula]

and D(x) is given by Eq.([\ref=Dx]).

Finally, we would like to discuss the τ- lepton polarization effects for the process B  →  τ+τ-γ. The longitudinal polarization asymmetry of the τ- lepton is defined as

[formula]

where SL is the orthogonal unit vector for the polarization of the τ- lepton to the longitudinal direction (L) and in the CM frame of the τ+τ- system, it is defined as

[formula]

Here, [formula] and Eτ are the three momentum and energy of the τ- lepton in the CM frame, respectively. Calculation of PL leads to the following result

[formula]

In order to investigate the dependence of the τ- lepton polarization on the model III parameters, we eliminate the other parameter, namely x, by performing the x-integrations over the allowed kinematical region (Eq.([\ref=KR])) so as to obtain the averaged lepton polarization. For the longitudinal component the averaged lepton polarization is defined as

[formula]

For the process B  →  τ+τ-γ, the lepton polarization has, in addition to the longitudinal component PL, transverse and normal components. Since these two orthogonal components are proportional to the tau lepton mass, they are expected to be significant for the τ+τ- channel. We shall discuss their effects in a more detailed paper.

Numerical analysis and discussion

To calculate the decay width, first of all, we need the explicit forms of the form factors g, ~ f, ~ g1 and f1. In refs. [\cite=Buchalla] and [\cite=Eilam2], they are calculated in the framework of light-cone QCD sum rules and their q2 dependences, to a very good accuracy, can be represented in the following dipole forms,

[formula]

where

[formula]

In addition to these form factors, the other input parameters which we have used in our numerical calculations are given in table I.

For the free parameters of the model III, namely, the masses of charged and neutral Higgs bosons, mH±,mA0,mh0,mH0 and the Yukawa couplings (ξU,Dij), we use the restrictions coming from B  →  Xs  γ decay, whose BR is given by CLEO measurement [\cite=CLEO] as

[formula]

and B0  -  0 mixing [\cite=Aliev4], ρ parameter [\cite=Atwood] and neutron electric-dipole moment [\cite=D.Bowser], that yields DN,ib  ~  0 and DN,ij  ~  0, where the indices i,j denote d and s quarks, and Ntc <  < UNtt. Therefore, we take into account only the Yukawa couplings of b and t quarks, UN,tt and DN,bb and also DN,ττ. Further, in our numerical calculations we adopted the restriction, 0.257  ≤  |Ceff7|  ≤  0.439 due to the CLEO measurement, Eq.([\ref=cleomes]), (see [\cite=Aliev4] for details) and the redefinition

[formula]

Before we present our results, a small note about the calculations of the long distance (LD) effects is in place. We take into account five possible resonances for the LD effects coming from the reaction b  →  s  ψi  →  s  τ+τ-, where i = 1,...,5 and divide the integration region into two parts: δ  ≤  x  ≤  1 - ((mψ2 + 0.02) / mB)2 and 1 - ((mψ2 - 0.02) / mB)2  ≤  x  ≤  1 - (2mτ / mB)2, where mψ2 = 3.686 GeV is the mass of the second resonance. (See Appendix for the details of LD contributions).

In this section, we first study the dimensionless photon energy dependence of the differential branching ratio (dBR / dx) and the model III parameters dependence of the BR and also the forward-backward asymmetry, AFB. The results of our calculations are presented through the graphs in Fig.([\ref=dGNHBLDa])-([\ref=AFBIIIkttrb1a]). In Fig.([\ref=dGNHBLDa]), we present dBR(B  →  τ+τ-γ) / dx as a function of x = 2Eγ / mB for DN,bb = 40  mb and DN,ττ = 10  mτ, in case of the ratio [formula], including the long distance contributions. Here, the differential BR lies in the region bounded by dashed (solid) curves for Ceff7 < 0 (Ceff7 > 0). We see from this figure that there is an enhancement for the dBR(B  →  τ+τ-γ) / dx in model III compared to the SM result for the Ceff7 > 0 case, while for Ceff7 < 0, model III predictions almost coincide with the SM one (small dashed curve). Fig. ([\ref=dGNHBLDb]) is devoted the same dependence of differential BR, but for DN,bb = 0.1  mb and DN,ττ  =  mτ, in case of the ratio rtb > 1. We see that model III predictions for the Ceff7 > 0 and Ceff7 < 0 almost coincide and they are one order larger compared to both |rtb| < 1 case and the SM one.

Fig ([\ref=GamIIIkbbrk1b]) and ([\ref=GamIIIkbbrb1n]) show DN,bb / mb dependence of BR for DN,ττ  =  mτ , in case of the ratio |rtb| < 1 and rtb > 1, respectively. In Fig.([\ref=GamIIIkbbrk1b]), BR is restricted in the region between dashed lines (solid curves) for Ceff7 < 0 (Ceff7 > 0), while the small dashed straight line shows the SM contribution. In Fig. ([\ref=GamIIIkbbrb1n]), there is a single curve since the contributions for both Ceff7 > 0 and Ceff7 < 0 fit onto each other. We see that BR is quite sensitive to the parameter DN,bb / mb, for both |rtb| < 1 and rtb > 1, however the behavior is opposite for these two cases; for |rtb| < 1, BR is decreasing with the increasing values of DN,bb / mb, while for rtb > 1, it is increasing. Further, BR is 2-3 orders larger compared to the SM result for rtb > 1 case. For |rtb| < 1, the enhancement with respect to the SM prediction is relatively moderate; nearly (30 - 40)% for Ceff7 > 0, but for Ceff7 < 0 they almost coincide with the SM one.

The dependence of the BR on the Yukawa coupling DN,ττ is presented in Fig. ([\ref=GamIIIkttrk1]) (([\ref=GamIIIkttrb1])), for |rtb| < 1 ( rtb > 1) case with DN,bb = 40  mb (DN,bb = 0.1  mb). It is seen that BR is increasing with the increasing values of DN,ττ and this is the contribution due to NHB effects. From Fig. ([\ref=GamIIIkttrk1]), we see that the BR lies in the region bounded by solid lines for Ceff7 > 0 and it is sensitive to the NHB effects, while for Ceff7 < 0, it is almost the same as the SM result (dashed straight line). Note that the SM prediction for the BR is 7.89  ×  10- 9 and in model III without NHB effects, when |rtb| < 1 it is in between (7.83 - 7.97)  ×  10- 9 for Ceff7 > 0 and (8.73 - 8.50)  ×  10- 9 for Ceff7 < 0. When rtb > 1, upper and lower limits of the BR without NHB effects are (1.03 - 1.04)  ×  10- 7 for both Ceff7 > 0 and Ceff7 < 0. Thus, contribution from NHB effects is seen to reach the values that are two orders of magnitude larger than the overall contributions for both |rtb| < 1 and rtb > 1, even for small values of DN,ττ.

In Fig. ([\ref=dAFBdxrk1]), the differential AFB(x) is shown for DN,bb = 40  mb and DN,ττ = 10  mτ, in case of the ratio |rtb| < 1. Here, AFB(x) is restricted in the region between solid curves for Ceff7 > 0. It is seen that the value of |AFB(x)| stands less than the SM one. The dashed curves represent Ceff7 < 0 case and they almost coincide with the SM prediction for AFB(x). Fig.([\ref=dAFBdxrb1]) is the same as Fig. ([\ref=dAFBdxrk1]), but for rtb > 1 with DN,bb = 0.1  mb . For this case, the sign of AFB(x) is opposite to the SM prediction and |AFB(x)| is one order of magnitude smaller than the SM one.

In Fig. ([\ref=AFBIIIkttrk1]) we plot the AFB as a function of the Yukawa coupling DN,ττ for DN,bb = 40  mb and |rtb| < 1. AFB lies in the region bounded by dashed (solid) lines for Ceff7 < 0 ( Ceff7 > 0 ). As seen from Fig. ([\ref=AFBIIIkttrk1]) that AFB vanishes for the large values of DN,ττ for Ceff7 > 0, while Ceff7 < 0, it does not vanish in the given region of DN,ττ. Contributions to |AFB| from model III stand less than the SM ones. Fig.([\ref=AFBIIIkttrb1a]) is the same as Fig. ([\ref=AFBIIIkttrk1]) , but for rtb > 1 with DN,bb = 0.1  mb. Here, contributions for Ceff7 > 0 and Ceff7 < 0 coincide and both are restricted by the solid curves.

We present our analysis on the longitudinal component of the τ- lepton polarization through the graphs in Figs.([\ref=PLxIIINHBrk1])-([\ref=PLIIIkttrb1]). The dependence of PL on x is presented in Fig ([\ref=PLxIIINHBrk1]), for |rtb| < 1 case with DN,ττ  =  10  mτ. Here, PL is restricted in the region between dashed (solid ) curves for Ceff7 < 0 (Ceff7 > 0), while the small dashed curve shows the SM contribution. From this figure, we see that the 2HDM contributions change PL significantly compared to the SM case for Ceff7 > 0, especially for the small values of x. Fig. ([\ref=PLxIIINHBrb1]) is the same as Fig. ([\ref=PLxIIINHBrk1]), but rtb > 1 with DN,bb = 0.1  mb. In this figure, two solid curves restrict the possible values of PL for both Ceff7 < 0 and Ceff7 > 0 and it is seen that both the magnitude and the sign of PL are changed for rtb > 1.

The dependence of < PL  >   on the NHB parameter DN,ττ is presented in Fig. ([\ref=PLIIIkttrk1]) (([\ref=PLIIIkttrb1])), for |rtb| < 1 ( rtb > 1) case with DN,bb = 40  mb (DN,bb = 0.1  mb). We see that for |rtb| < 1, < PL  >   lies in the region bounded by dashed lines (solid curves) for Ceff7 < 0 ( Ceff7 > 0) (Fig. ([\ref=PLIIIkttrk1])), while in case of rtb > 1, the contributions for both Ceff7 < 0 and Ceff7 > 0 coincide and they are represented by the single solid curve in Fig.([\ref=PLIIIkttrb1]). It is obvious that < PL  >   is very much sensitive to the NHB effects for both |rtb| < 1 and rtb > 1 cases. We note that SM prediction for < PL  >   is - 0.36 and in model III without NHB effects, when |rtb| < 1, it is about - 0.31 for Ceff7 > 0 and - 0.36 for Ceff7 < 0. When rtb > 1, the value of < PL  >   without NHB effects is about - 0.36 for both Ceff7 > 0 and Ceff7 < 0. Thus, the value of < PL  >   without NHB effects reaches at most the SM prediction, but NHB effects enhance it between (5 - 100)%, even for small values of DN,ττ. We would like to summarize our results:

We observe an enhancement in the differential branching ratio and branching ratio for the exclusive process B  →  τ+τ-γ in the general 2HDM compared to the SM predictions. For |rtb| < 1 case, this enhancement is much more detectable for Ceff7 > 0 case compared to the Ceff7 < 0 one. For rtb > 1, we see that contributions for Ceff7 > 0 and Ceff7 < 0 almost coincide with each other, and the enhancement with respect to the SM is much more sizable.

BR for B  →  τ+τ-γ decay is at the order of magnitude 10- 9 (10- 7) in the SM and in model III without NHB effects for |rtb| < 1 ( rtb > 1). However, including NHB exchanges may enhance it almost two orders of magnitude compared to the SM prediction, even for the smaller values of DN,ττ.

|AFB| is at the order of magnitude 10- 1 (10- 2) for |rtb| < 1 (rtb > 1) case and smaller compared to the SM results, which is -0.181.

The 2HDM contributions change PL and < PL  >   greatly compared to the SM case and these quantities are very sensitive to the NHB effects.

In conclusion, we can say that experimental investigation of BR, AFB and PL may provide an essential test for the effects of NHB exchanges and new physics beyond the SM.

The operator basis

The operator basis in the 2HDM (model III ) for our process is [\cite=Dai] [\cite=Grinstein2] [\cite=Misiak]

[formula]

where α and β are SU(3) colour indices and Fμν and Gμν are the field strength tensors of the electromagnetic and strong interactions, respectively. Note that there are also flipped chirality partners of these operators, which can be obtained by interchanging L and R in the basis given above in model III. However, we do not present them here since corresponding Wilson coefficients are negligible.

The Wilson coefficients playing the essential role in this process are C2HDM7(μ), C2HDM9(μ), C2HDM10(μ), C2HDMQ1(μ) and C2HDMQ2(μ). For completeness, in the following we give their explicit expressions.
