A remark on potentially semi-stable representations of Hodge-Tate type (0,1)

Semi-stable representations of Hodge-Tate type (0,1)

Introduction

The purpose of this note is to complement part of a theorem from the remarkable paper of Fontaine and Mazur on geometric Galois representations [\cite=FM].

Fix a prime p, and let K be a finite extension of the p-adic numbers [formula]. Fix an algebraic closure q of K and let G be the Galois group of q over K. Fontaine's theory [\cite=FP] classifies various types of representations ρ:G   →    on finite-dimensional [formula]-vector spaces V, and we refer to op. cit. for terminology.

The theorem (C2. (ii) ⇔   (iii)) in question from [\cite=FM] says the following:

Of course, one should emphasize that the rest of the theorem gives much more detail, namely, a complete list of possibilities, and the theorem to follow is by no means a substitute for the refined statements. However, it might be worth remarking that at least this part admits an entirely simple proof in greater generality. We note also that [\cite=FM] C2. (i) ⇔  (ii), the equivalence between crystalline representations of Hodge-Tate type (0,1) and Barsotti-Tate representations, has been proved for p  ≠  2 and arbitrary dimension by [\cite=F], [\cite=FL] in the small ramification case and [\cite=B] in general.

We are grateful to the referee for suggesting improvements.

Main Theorem

The main result of this note is the following.

Let (V,ρ) be a irreducible finite-dimensional Hodge-Tate representation of G of Hodge-Tate type (0,1). Then V is potentially semi-stable if and only if V is potentially crystalline.

Note that there is no restriction on p or the dimension.

It is not necessary to restrict oneself to the case of finite residue field. It suffices to work with perfect residue fields. The proof given below goes through without any difficulty.

Of course we need only prove the 'only if' part. So assume ρ is potentially semi-stable and let H  ⊂  G be a normal subgroup of finite index such that ρ|H is semi-stable. We claim that the H-representation has a non-zero crystalline subrepresentation. To see this let M = Dst(V) be the associated filtered (φ,N)-module. Since M is weakly-admissible, the slopes of φ are all in the interval

The idea of using kernel of N also occurs in Corollary 5.3.4 of [\cite=B].

An example

An important ingredient in the proof is the fact that a semi-stable representation of Hodge-Tate type (0,1) is either crystalline or has a crystalline filtration, i.e., a filtration whose associated graded objects are crystalline. That this cannot be a general phenomenon was remarked by Jannsen in [\cite=J], where he considers a [formula] representation of dimension 2 associated to a modular form of weight 4 and level 5. Here we expand on a construction of [\cite=FM] to illustrate that the conditions of the theorem cannot be relaxed in any dimension. In fact, the examples will be strongly irreducible, that is, irreducible even when restricted to a finite index subgroup, and a fortiori cannot have a crystalline filtration even after such a restriction.

The Fontaine-Mazur construction goes as follows: Let M =  < e1,e2  >   be a two dimensional [formula] vector space spanned by vectors e1,e2. Let s  ≥  3 be an odd integer and let [formula] be a p-dic integer such that vp(b) = (s - 1) / 2. We define a filtration on M by FiliM = M for i  ≤  0, and FiliM = FilsM =  < e1  >   for 1  ≤  i  ≤  s; and FiliM = 0 for i > s. The operator φ is defined by φ(e1) = pbe1 and φ(e2) = be2; N(e1) = e2. We see right away that tH(M) = s and tN(M) = 1 + (s - 1) / 2 + (s - 1) / 2 = s. Now, the only (φ,N)-invariant subspace of M is < e2  >  , to which the filtration restricts trivially. Thus, tN( < e2 > ) = (s - 1) / 2 > tH( < e2 > ) = 0 and therefore, M is weakly admissible, while it does not admit any weakly admissible submodules. Thus, V = Vst(M) is an irreducible semi-stable representation for [formula] [\cite=FC]. Since N  ≠  0, V is not crystalline, so V is a two-dimensional example of a representation which does not admit a crystalline filtration. But exactly the same argument shows that the filtered (φ,N)-module [formula] has no weakly admissible submodules for any extension K of [formula] (because of N, extending the coefficients does not allow us to pick up any other invariant lines). Extending the coefficients of M corresponds to restricting to a subgroup of G, therefore, we see that V is even irreducible when restricted to finite index subgroups of G.

We can say more by investigating the endomorphisms of M. Suppose f is such an endomorphism. By checking the conditions of commuting with φ and N, we see that f must be a scalar [formula]. That is, [formula]. In fact, we can see that [formula] for any extension K of [formula]: Write f(e1) = xe1 + ye2 and f(e2) = ze1 + we2 for x,y,z,w∈K. The condition of commuting with N gives us z = 0 and x = w. f(φ(e2)) = φ(f(e2)) says that bw = bσ(w)  ⇒  w = σ(w), where σ:K  →  K is the Frobenius (lift) of K, so we get [formula]. Similarly, f(φ(e1)) = φ(f(e1)) gives us bpwe1 + bpye2 = bpwe1  +  σ(y)be2 so that σ(y) = py. Since σ cannot change the valuation of non-zero elements, this implies y = 0. Note that the above computation does not require the filtration at all. By the equivalence of categories given by Vst and Dst, we see that for any finite index subgroup H of G, [formula]. Since we already know that V is [formula]-simple (this does require the filtration), this implies that [formula] by Wedderburn's theorem. In particular, H must act irreducibly on Symn(V) for all n > 0. This way, we obtain a G-representation for all dimensions n  ≥  2 which cannot admit a crystalline filtration for any finite index subgroup.

The proof of also shows that for the semi-stable Galois module V constructed above, the image of G in GL(V) is open. This is a consequence of the following facts: 1) by the above calculation V remains irreducible on restriction to any open subgroup of G and its endomorphism ring is [formula]. 2) By a standard result the image of Galois for any Hodge-Tate representation is open in its Zariski closure.
