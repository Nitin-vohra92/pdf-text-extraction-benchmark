S-Partitions

Introduction

The s-partition of an integer n is a decomposition [formula] such that each ni is of the form 2k - 1, for some integer k. Closely related are binary partitions, i.e. partitions whose cells are powers of 2 (see [\cite=pen]). Perhaps, the simplest form of a binary partition of a number is its binary representation, in which each part size has the form 2k, for some integer k. Given an integer n its binary representation can be computed by using consecutive shifts in Θ( log n) steps.

An important computation in most of the cryptographic systems is the computations of the form an  mod  m (see [\cite=sch]). In [\cite=bha], Bhatt presented an NC-algorithm for computations of this form on a CRCW parallel model. While giving a characterization of s-partitions, for a given integer n, he presented a simple algorithm for computing its d-partition in Θ( log n). He went on to use this decomposition in computing an  mod  m in poly-logarithmic time on a distributed system, using polynomial number of processors in terms of n.

As the main theoretical result Bhatt gave the quantity

[formula]

(where log  means log 2) as an upper bound for the number of s partitions of an integer n, but this bound is not correct. The purpose of this note is to present a correction to his result by giving a precise asymptotics for the number of s-partitions. Specifically, we have

Let ps(n) denote the total number of s-partitions of an integer n and for a function [formula], let [formula] Then,

[formula]

A proof is a quick consequence of a theorem that was proven with binary partitions in mind. Such partitions have been studied by several authors beginning in the 40's. Not surprisingly, the results obtained by these authors are general enough to be applicable in the context of s-partitions. We will recall one such theorem proved in [\cite=pen] in the next section.

Proof of Theorem 1

Here is a relevant part of a theorem proved by Pennington. We refer the reader to his paper [\cite=pen] for more details and credits concerning pre-1953 activities.

Let [formula] be a given sequence of numbers with

[formula]

for u > 0, where

[formula]

as u  →    ∞  , a, b, c, ρ are constants, a > 0, ρ > 0, and V is a periodic function with period 1, bounded and integrable in the interval 0  ≤  x  ≤  1. Let {cν:   -    ∞    <  ν  <    ∞  } be the complex Fourier coefficients of V and suppose that c0 = 0 and [formula]. For real u let P(u) be the number of solutions of the inequality

[formula]

in integers [formula], and let Ph(u) = {P(u) - P(u - h)} / h. Then, if h is a positive constant for which Ph(u) is an increasing function of u (this condition is certainly satisfied if h belongs to the sequence λν), as u  →    ∞  ,

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

The function W(z) is defined for all z = x + iy in the strip [formula], and is bounded and uniformly continuous in any fixed interior strip [formula].

We observe that if λ1 = 1 then, for an integer n, P1(n + 1) counts the number of partitions of n into parts of sizes in the set [formula]. In particular, ps(n) = P1(n + 1) for the sequence λν = 2ν - 1, [formula]. Thus, in order to prove Theorem 1, it suffices to check that this sequence satisfies the assumptions of Pennington's theorem with

[formula]

To this end we write

[formula]

and we will show that

[formula]

has the desired properties. Since λ1 = 1, we have

[formula]

where [formula] as defined in Theorem 1. Changing the variables t = 1 / v in the first integral we see that it converges to

[formula]

To handle the second integral, we rely on work of Pennington who showed that

[formula]

The difference between the two is

[formula]

An elementary calculation shows that the middle integral is zero and since the function f is uniformly bounded, the last integral vanishes as u  →    ∞  . The first integral converges absolutely to α defined in Theorem 1. Comparing ([\ref=eq1]) through ([\ref=eq4]) with the statement of Theorem 2, we see that its conditions are satisfied with the constants a, b, c, and ρ given by ([\ref=constants]) and with Fourier coefficients c0 = 0 and [formula] for [formula]. This proves Theorem 1.
