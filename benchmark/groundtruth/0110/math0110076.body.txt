On sequences cat (fk)

Let f:X  →  Y be a map of finite CW-spaces. An f-categorical set is an open subset A of X such that f|A:A  →  Y is null-homotopic. An f-categorical covering is a covering {Ai} of X such that every set Ai is f-categorical. The Lusternik-Schnirelmann category [formula] of f is defined to be the minimal number k such that there exists a k-elemented f-categorical covering, [\cite=F] [\cite=Fe] [\cite=BG]. We also set [formula].

Given a pointed space, we always denote its base point by *  .

For every diagram

[formula]

we have: [formula]

Proof. Clearly, every f-categorical covering is gf-categorical one. Furthermore, if {Ai} is a g-categorical covering then {f- 1(Ai)} is gf-categorical covering.

For two maps f:X  →  Y and g:A  →  B we have

[formula]

where [formula] is the wedge of f and g.

Proof. We assume that [formula] and [formula] with k  ≥  l. Let [formula] be an f-categorical covering and let [formula] be a g-categorical covering. The image of Ui in [formula] will also be denoted by Ui, and similarly for Vj. We can and shall assume that *  ∉Vi for i > 1 and *  ∉Vj for j > 1. Then, clearly, [formula] is an [formula]-categorical set. Furthermore, since

[formula]

we conclude that [formula] is open in [formula], and therefore [formula] is [formula]-categorical. Now,

[formula]

is an [formula]-categorical covering.

Consider now a map f:X  →  X. Because of what we said above, the sequence [formula] is a decreasing sequence of natural numbers. Here we prove that, conversely, every such a sequence can be realized as the sequence of the form [formula]. In other words, the following theorem holds.

Theorem. Let {ak} be a sequence of natural numbers with ak  ≥  ak + 1. Then there exists a self map f:X  →  X of a CW-space such that [formula] and [formula].

Proof. Clearly, every sequence {ak} as above stabilizes, i.e. there exists m such that ak = ak + 1 for k  ≥  m. We set

[formula]

and prove the theorem by induction on D({ak}).

For D = 1 the result is obvious. Namely, we take a space X with [formula] (for example, the real projective space of dimension a1 - 1) and set f = 1X.

Now, suppose that the theorem holds for D = n, i.e. that for every sequence {ck} with D({ck}) = n there exists a map f:X  →  X with [formula]. Consider a sequence {ak} with D({ak}) = n + 1 and set [formula]. Then D({bk}) = n, and so there exists a map f:X  →  X with [formula] and [formula].

Let Y be a pointed space with [formula], and let ε:Y  →  {  *  }  ⊂  Y be the constant map. Consider the map

[formula]

where [formula] is the pinch map. Clearly, [formula]. On the other hand, since the composition

[formula]

is the identity map, we conclude that, by Proposition [\ref=p1], [formula]. Thus, [formula].

Consider the map

[formula]

and set [formula]. We claim that [formula].

First, by Proposition [\ref=p2], for k = 1 we have

[formula]

because [formula].

Furthermore, we have [formula]. But uk is the constant map for k > 1, and hence [formula]. So, it suffices to prove that [formula] for k > 1.

It is easy to see that vk has the form

[formula]

So, by Propositions [\ref=p1] and [\ref=p2],

[formula]

On the other hand, fk - 1 can be decomposed as

[formula]

and so [formula]. Thus, [formula].

Finally, [formula] by Proposition [\ref=p2]. This completes the proof.

I am grateful to Alexander Felshtyn for statement of the problem: he asked me about properties of sequences of the form [formula].
