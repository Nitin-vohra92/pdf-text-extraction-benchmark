We fit the CKM-matrix to all recent data with the following free parameters: three mixing angles, the CP-violating angle δ in the Maiani parametrisation, the top quark mass mt, and the product fBB1 / 2B0, where fB is the B-meson decay parameter and BB0 is the bag parameter. Our fits span a contiguous region in the (fBB1 / 2B0,  cos δ)-plane, limited by [formula] and -0.95 [formula] cos δ [formula] 0.70. The parameters fBB1 / 2B0 and cos δ are strongly positively correlated.

When B0  -  0 mixing was first discovered [\cite=argus] this offered a way to estimate the mass of the top quark, since the box amplitude responsible for mixing is dominated by the top exchange. The B0  -  0 mixing actually determines only the product fBB1 / 2B0m2tF(m2t), where fB is the unknown pseudoscalar decay constant of the B0, BB0 is the unknown bag parameter, and F(m2t) is a known smooth function of the top mass (given below). To estimate mt from this product some theoretical input [\cite=Shifman] of the QCD quantity fBB1 / 2B0 was needed. The mixing data combined with other charged current input then predicted a top mass value [formula] GeV [\cite=MR],[\cite=altarelli],[\cite=schubert].

The situation has now changed when the first experimental determination of mt is available. This allows one to reverse the problem, using the charged current data and mt to obtain a phenomenological and less model-dependent estimate of fBB1 / 2B0. This information may then be confronted with the predictions of theoretical models and lattice calculations, which differ quite substantially from each other, ranging from about 115 MeV [\cite=Shifman] to 300 MeV [\cite=Allton].

In this paper we update our previous analysis of the CKM matrix [\cite=MR] by taking into account the new CDF result for mt [\cite=CDF], and by using the most recent data for other relevant observables: the CKM matrix elements from various charged current processes, the CP-violation parameter |ε| from the neutral kaon system, and the B0  -  0 mixing parameters χd,s. The input data are collected in Table 1. For mt we have used a value obtained by combining the CDF result mt = 174  ±  10+ 13- 12 GeV [\cite=CDF] with the indirect value from the fits of the LEP data, the deep inelastic neutrino-nucleon scattering data and the W mass measurement, mt = 164+ 16  + 13- 17  - 21 GeV [\cite=Hol].

The formalism used to relate the CKM matrix elements to various experimental input is well known (cf.  e.g. [\cite=MR] [\cite=Ali]). What is new in our approach compared with our previous analysis [\cite=MR] is a quite trivial change in the CP-violating parameter: we use the cosine of the angle δ (in the Maiani parametrisation) rather than the sine. This choice has the advantage of exhibiting explicitly that the allowed region in the (fBB1 / 2B0, cos δ)-space is contiguous, in contrast to previous analyses which found separate solutions in the first and the second quadrant of δ.

The quantities measured in B0  -  0 mixing experiments are the probability fractions

[formula]

which can be expressed in the form χd,s = x2d,s(1 + x2d,s)- 1 / 2, where

[formula]

Here the function F is defined by [\cite=Inami]

[formula]

The hard QCD correction factor ηBq depends quite strongly on the top mass. For mt = 174 GeV one finds from [\cite=BurasJamin] ηB≃0.49. The experimental averages for the B0d and B0s lifetimes are [\cite=Danilov]

[formula]

For the masses of the neutral beauty mesons we will use [\cite=Danilov] [\cite=PDG]

[formula]

The only unknown parameters, apart from the CKM matrix elements, in ([\ref=x]) are the decay constant fBq and the bag parameter BBq.

Combining the most recent results of ARGUS and CLEO [\cite=Ven] gives for χd the value

[formula]

In the experiments where both [formula] and [formula] are produced one measures the sum χ = fdχd + fsχs where fd and fs are the abundances of Bd and Bs in the b-quark jet. A recent average of all existing results is given by Danilov [\cite=Danilov]:

[formula]

In applying this quantity we use fd = 0.375 and fs = 0.15.

Furthermore, we shall assume a fixed SU(3) breaking ratio from lattice calculations [\cite=Abada]

[formula]

to which the fit is quite insensitive.

The theoretical expression for the CP-violation parameter ε depends on the poorly known bag factor BK, whereas ε itself is well measured ([formula] [\cite=PDG]). Thus the proper procedure is to use a constraint for BK expressed in terms of a constant ε without error. For BK we use the value

[formula]

which covers the values from different lattice and 1 / N expansion evaluations quoted by ref. [\cite=Mac]. The theoretical expression for |ε| is obtained essentially as the imaginary part of the box amplitude for the neutral kaon mixing [\cite=BurasSS].

Experimental results [\cite=NA31] [\cite=E731] on the parameter |ε'|, describing CP violation in K0  →  ππ decays, are controversial, and the experimental accuracy of this quantity is poor. Moreover, some terms in the theoretical expression are still imprecisely known. We shall therefore not include |ε'| in our analysis.

There are 7 free parameters and 14 constraints in the fit: the three mixing angles in the CKM matrix, the CP-phase δ, the parameter fBB1 / 2B0, and the top quark mass mt (the seventh parameter is a quark ratio κ entering two constraints on |Vcs|). The constraints can be fitted excellently with χ2 = 8.6 for 7 degrees of freedom. There is obviously no reason to increase the "theoretical errors" further on various input parameters, as some people would advocate, because that would just make the fit too good.

The conventional definition of errors on the parameters is always to increment the best fit χ2 by 1. However, since we are mainly interested in the simultaneous 68.3 % confidence region for the two parameters fBB1 / 2B0 and cos δ, one should increment the best fit χ2 by 2.3. This then gives the contour in Fig. 1. The errors on the mixing angles are of less interest, these parameters being rather unphysical, and the fit error on mt is essentially equal to the experimental error.

Our best fit yields the parameters and conventional 1σ errors

[formula]

The elements of the CKM matrix obtain the following values:

[formula]

Fig. 1 shows that fB0B1 / 2B0 and cos δ are very strongly positively correlated, and still poorly determined. The 1σ contour in the (fBB1 / 2B0,  cos δ)-plane, is limited to 0.117 [formula] 0.231 and -0.95 [formula] cos δ [formula] 0.70.

Recent lattice calculations of fB0 yield the values 180  ±  50 MeV [\cite=Alexandrou], 187  ±  37 MeV [\cite=Bernard] and 200  ±  40 MeV [\cite=Maiani]. This is in good agreement with the contour in Fig. 1. Some earlier estimates, e.g. [\cite=Allton], with higher values of fB are instead excluded. Perhaps one could expect the next improvement in precision to come from the lattice calculations; this would then permit to determine cos δ well.

On the other hand, if the situation regarding |ε'|  /  |ε| were clarified theoretically and well measured experimentally, that would help to pin down cos δ, and in consequence fB0B1 / 2B0 could be determined more precisely.
