Optical response of C60 and C70 fullerenes: Exciton and lattice fluctuation effects

INTRODUCTION

Fullerenes have a hollow cage of carbons [\cite=1]. Its structure is formed with σ-bondings. The π-electron orbitals extend to the outside of the cage. As π-electrons are delocalized on the surface of fullerenes, the optical properties are similar to those of π-conjugated polymers [\cite=2]. Recently, we have applied the intermediate exciton formalism which was used in polymers [\cite=3], and have investigated relevant Coulomb parameters in order to understand the dispersions and oscillator strengths of the absorption spectra of the neutral C60 (C70) [\cite=4] [\cite=5] and maximally doped systems [\cite=6] [\cite=7]. The purpose of this article is to review the main results published elsewhere [\cite=8] [\cite=9].

In the formalism [\cite=8], a tight binding model with a long-range Coulomb interaction and bond disorder has been used. The free electron part corresponds to the simple Hückel model with the mean hopping integral t; the presence of the dimerization is considered for the neutral C60 case, and the constant hopping is assumed for the other cases. The long-range Coulomb interaction is the Ohno expression: [formula]. Here, U is the onsite Coulomb strength, V is the long-range component, and r0 is the average bond length. The bond disorder model with the Gaussian distribution of the hopping integral with a standard deviation ts simulates the lattice fluctuation effects [\cite=10]. This gives rise to broadening of the absorption spectra. The model is solved by the Hartree-Fock approximation and the single excitation configuration interaction method. Optical spectra are obtained by using the dipole approximation. In the next two sections, we present the calculated spectra and compare them with experiments.

NEUTRAL C[formula] AND C[formula]

We discuss the calculated optical absorption spectra of C60 and C70. C60 has high Ih symmetry, and C70 has lower D5h symmetry. Figure 1(a) shows the spectrum of C60, and Fig. 1(b) that of C70. Parameters, U = 4t, V = 2t, ts  =  0.09t, and t = 1.8eV, are used. These parameters are determined so as to reproduce the experimental spectra as good as possible. Experimental data of molecules in solutions are taken from [\cite=4] [\cite=5], and are shown by thin lines. There are three main features in C60 absorption found around the energies 3.5eV, 4.7eV, and 5.6eV. In the case of C70, we could say that several small peaks in the energy interval from 1.7eV to 3.6eV are originated from the 3.5eV feature of C60 after splitting. The 4.7eV and 5.6eV features of C60 overlap into the large feature present in the energy region larger than 3.6eV. The optical gap decreases from 3.1eV (C60) to 1.7eV (C70). These changes would be due to the symmetry reduction from the C60 soccer ball to the C70 rugby ball. There is a good agreement with experiments about the peak positions and relative oscillator strengths in the C60 case. The agreement is overall for C70. There is a systematic deviation of the experimental curves from the theoretical ones at energies higher than 5.0eV due to the overlap of σ-electron excitations.

MAXIMALLY DOPED C[formula] AND C[formula]

Calculations are performed for C6 -60 and C6 -70 in order to look at molecular exciton effects in A6C60 and A6C70 solids (A  =   alkali metals). Results are shown in Figs. 2(a) and (b) with the experimental absorption [\cite=6] and the optical conductivity data obtained by the EELS studies [\cite=7]. We find that the parameter set, U = 2t, V = 1t, ts  =  0.20t, and t = 2.0eV, is relevant to both systems. For A6C60, two features around 1.2eV and 2.8eV are reasonably explained by the present calculation. The broadening is simulated well by the bond disorder. The disorder strength ts  =  0.20t is about the twice as large as that of the neutral C60. The broad feature in the energies higher than 3.6eV in the experiments might correspond to the two broad peaks around 4.4eV and 6.0eV of the calculation. In these energies, the agreement is not so good. The same fact has been seen in the neutral C60 case. Excitations which include σ-orbitals would mix in this energy region. This effect could be taken into account by using models with π- and σ-electrons. For A6C70 shown in Fig. 2(b), we can assign that the features at 1.2eV, 2.6eV, and 4.6eV of the calculation correspond to the peaks at 1.0eV, 2.7eV, and 4.2eV of the experiment, respectively. Thus, we can explain the presence of three broad features observed by experiments.

DISCUSSION

We have mainly looked at Frenkel exciton effects in the neutral and maximally doped C60 (and C70) molecules. The relevant Coulomb parameters for the optical spectra are U  ~  2V  ~  4t for the neutral systems, and U  ~  2V  ~  2t for A6C60 and A6C70 solids. In the Ohno potential, the dielectric screening of Coulomb interactions can be taken into account by assuming U  =  U0  /  εs and V  =  V0  /  εl, where εs and εl are short- and long-range dielectric constants. The magnitude of the static dielectric constant increases by the factor about two upon doping: ε1(0)  =  4.3 in the neutral C60 and ε1(0)  =  7.1 in Rb6C60, and also ε1(0)  =  4.0 in the neutral C70 and ε1(0)  =  8.0 in Rb6C70 [\cite=7]. This enhancement of dielectric constants reasonably accords with the decrease of U and V in the present calculations.
