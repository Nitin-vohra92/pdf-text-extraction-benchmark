STATUS OF THE SOLAR NEUTRINO PUZZLE

The solar neutrino puzzle has been with us for many years and an excellent review of the subject can be found in ref.[\cite=Bbook]. Recently the Gallium solar neutrino experiments have reduced their uncertainties so that a very simple argument can be made demonstrating the difficulty of explaining the experimental results using only known physics. The simplest form of this argument is presented in this paper. Additional features could be introduced which would strengthen this argument but for the sake of simplicity and clarity they have not been included.

The argument, first used in ref.[\cite=first], makes the following assumptions about the sun, neutrino properties and neutrino interaction cross sections:

The pp-solar-cycle is the dominant energy source of the Sun.

The Sun is in a quasi-equilibrium, i.e. the solar luminosity a few million years from now will be approximately the same as today.

The neutrinos are unaffected during their propagation from production in the solar core to their detection at the earth.

The neutrino interaction cross sections for the three types of experiments are correct.

With these four assumptions the main contributions to the solar neutrino experiments are determined by two parameters, the 7Be  and 8B  neutrino fluxes. Therefore with three solar neutrino results one can compare the standard solar models with the experimental results taken two at a time.

The main sequence of reactions that make up pp-solar-cycle can be summarized as follows;

[formula]

The total energy release in these reactions is 26.73 MeV but the ,, and [formula] carry off on average 0.265, 0.861 and 7 MeV respectively. Therefore the energy release, not including the average neutrino energies, is 26.2, 25.6 and 19.5 MeV.

If the solar luminosity, [formula], is approximately constant over a few million year time scale then there is a relation between the current solar luminosity and the current solar neutrino fluxes, Φi. This relation can be written as

[formula]

For convenience it is useful to normalize the neutrino fluxes to those of the solar model of Bahcall and Pinsonneault [formula],

[formula]

where

[formula]

In these normalized flux units the solar luminosity constraint is simply

[formula]

This will be used to determine pp  in terms of 7Be.

The contribution of the , and [formula] to the chlorine, water and gallium solar neutrino experiments is

[formula]

The coefficients in eq.([\ref=tc])-([\ref=tg0]) are determined using the assumptions that the state of the neutrinos is unaffected by the passage from the solar core to the terrestrial detectors, i.e. there is no change in the flavor, helicity or energy spectrum, and that the neutrino interaction cross sections used are corrected. The uncertainty on these cross sections is estimated to be a few per cent.

Using the luminosity constraint to eliminated the   ~   flux, the contribution to the gallium experiments can be written as

[formula]

The additional contributions from other specifies of neutrinos is less than 10% in the standard solar models [formula].

Over the past summer new results from the four solar neutrino experiments have been reported. The results for Homestake[formula], Kamiokande[formula], Gallex[formula] and SAGE[formula] are

[formula]

where the first uncertainty is statistical and second systematic. To form a combined result for gallium, the mean and statistical errors for SAGE and Gallex were combined in the standard way but a common systematic error of 6 SNU was used. Then the statistical and systematic errors are combined in quadrature for each experimental result giving

[formula]

These results are now used to fit the two parameters, 7Be  and 8B , of the model, eq.([\ref=tc]), ([\ref=th]) and ([\ref=tg]). The χ2  variable was calculated for the four cases; all three results together and the three ways of choosing two out of three. Since the minimum value of χ2  occurs at negative values of 7Be  for all four cases, the constraint

[formula]

was imposed [formula]. Table 1 contains the minimum value of χ2  with this constraint, which all occur along  = 0, as well as the value of 8B  at the minimum.

Figures 1 through 4 are the contour plots of χ2  as function of 7Be  and 8B  for the four cases; Chlorine plus Water plus Gallium, Chlorine plus Water, Chlorine plus Gallium and Water plus Gallium, respectively. The 1σ to 5σ contours are determined by Δ  =   2.3, 6.2, 11.8, 19.4 and 28.7, respectively [formula], from the minimum with   ≥  0. Also include on these plots are the total theoretical ranges of the standard solar model predictions of Bahcall & Pinsonneault [formula], Turck-Chièze & Lopes [formula] and the ad hoc solar "model" where the central temperature of the sun is a free parameter [formula].

Since the standard models of Bahcall & Pinsonneault  and Turck-Chièze & Lopes  are consistent with our assumptions both of these models are excluded by many sigma independent of which set of experimental results are included. Fig.2, using only Chlorine plus Water, is just a reformulation of the argument by Bahcall and Bethe [formula] but here the exclusion is at the 5σ confidence level. Fig. 3 demonstrates a similar case for Chlorine Plus Gallium. The least convincing case occurs with Water plus Gallium, Fig. 4, and even then the two standard solar models are excluded at almost the three sigma level. The ad hoc "model," where the central temperature of the sun is a free parameter, is excluded at the two sigma level independent of which two experimental results are chosen. It is worth noting that the case using Water plus Gallium excludes this model at a higher level of confidence than either of the Chlorine plus Water or the Chlorine plus Gallium cases. Of course the case Chlorine plus Water plus Gallium gives the strongest exclusion to all models, Fig. 1. If the contribution from the pep and CNO neutrinos had been included the confidence level of all exclusions would have been even stronger[formula].

The conclusion from these figures is that, given the assumptions delineated above, either the standard solar models are ruled out at the 3σ level or at least two of the solar neutrino experiments are incorrect[formula]. Prior to the release of the latest experimental results, only one of the solar neutrino experiments needed to be incorrect to remove the discrepancy between the standard solar models and the data. Now, at least two experiments must be incorrect to remove this discrepancy. The probability that two independent experiments are incorrect is considerably smaller than one. This is a strong argument in favor of the conclusion that one of the above assumptions is wrong or that there is solar physics we do not understand. One of the above assumptions is that neutrinos are unaffected in their transition from the solar interior to the terrestrial detectors. The possibility that this assumption is incorrect has been discussed by many authors who have suggested neutrino oscillations and/or neutrino spin flip as explanations of the above discrepancy.
