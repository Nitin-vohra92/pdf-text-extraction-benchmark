1. The well-known Doniach dichotomy [\cite=1] for the ground state of the Kondo lattice offers the antiferromagnetic state at small values of effective coupling parameter α = Jsf  /  εF and the nonmagnetic "Kondo-singlet" state at large values of α as the ground states of the system. Here Jsf is the on-site sf-exchange integral and εF is the energy characterizing the width of conduction electron band. The critical region where two regimes compete is determined by the condition α2c0  ≈   exp ( - 1 / 2αc0), or, in other terms, TN  ≈  TK where TN,K are the Neel and Kondo temperatures, respectively. We show in this paper that the third possibility can be realized at α  ~  αc0: the Kondo-stabilized spin liquid state of the RVB type is formed instead of the Kondo singlet state. This neutral spin-fermi liquid interacts strongly with charged conduction electrons, the low-temperature termodynamics is determined mainly by the spin-component of this two-component Fermi liquid, whereas the conduction electrons with enhanced effective masses are responsible for the charge transport and diamagnetic properties of the system in accordance with the phenomenological picture offered in [\cite=2] [\cite=22] [\cite=222].

The idea of Kondo-type stabilization mechanism of the resonance valence bond state was offered in [\cite=3]. Coleman and Andrei described a picture of resonating valence bonds linked up with the electrons in a layer of TK around the Fermi energy. However, the introduction of the Kondo-type mean field resulted in charge transfer from the low-energy conduction electrons to the neutral fermi excitations originating from the f spins. Thus they obtained a "charged spin liquid" like that considered in the mean-field slave-boson theory [\cite=9]. The general arguments against such a procedure were presented in [\cite=2], and here we show that formation of spin liquid can prevent the system from forming the Kondo singlets, and the Fermi liquid with neutral spin and charged electron components is formed instead.

2. We start with a standard Kondo lattice Hamiltonian Heff which can be derived from the general Anderson lattice model in the case of nearly integer valence.

[formula]

Here εk is the band level of conduction electron, [formula] and [formula] are the operator of localized f spin and conduction electron spin, respectively, σ̂ is the Pauli matrix.

To consider this strongly coupled electron liquid in a controllable way, we start from the high temperature region T > TK where the non-crossing approximation (NCA) is acceptable and logarithmic perturbation theory is valid. We study the competition between the homogeneous RVB [\cite=3] [\cite=6] and Neel ordering within the mean field approximation by using the Abrikosov pseudofermion operator representation (see, e.g., [\cite=8]) for the f-spins, [formula]. Then the on-site and intersite contributions of the indirect RKKY interaction to the self energy part of the pseudofermion temperature Green's function F(iεn) are given by the diagrams of fig.1a and 1b, respectively. Here the dashed and full lines stand for the pseudofermion and conduction electron propagators, hatched squares and crosshatched rectangles symbolize the sf- and ff vertex parts renormalized by the multiple on-site electron-spin scattering. First of these diagrams describes the standard molecular field due to the indirect RKKY interaction acting on the spin in a site [formula], and second one corresponds to the "anomalous" RVB-type correlations. The polarization operator in the diagram 1a is taken in a nearest neighbor approximation,

[formula]

where [formula] is a structure factor, [formula]. The possibility of commensurate magnetic order with the antiferromagnetic vector [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] is suggested.

We consider the renormalization of these diagrams by the on-site Kondo scattering at T > TK. According to the NCA approach, this scattering processes renormalize independently the vertices Γ belonging to different cites [formula], and this renormalization should be taken in the logarithmic approximation where the maximum energy variable in the argument of the vertex part is retained. This energy is determined by the characteristic frequencies of the electron Green's function G(iεm) entering the polarization operator ΠR(iωn) in the RKKY interaction.

Within the mean-field approach the transition temperatures TN and TRVB are found from the self-consistent equations for the temperature Green's functions with the self-energy parts shown in figs.1(a,b). These approximations are obtained in a static approximation for RKKY interaction. It was found by Doniach [\cite=1] that the Kondo scattering destroys the magnetic order in a Kondo lattice at least at α  >  αc, and the "Kondo singlet" state can be formed in this strong coupling limit. Later it was recognized [\cite=3] that one can expect the stabilization of RVB phase instead of the hypothetical Kondo singlet phase provided the inequality |TRVB - TN|  ≪  TK is valid. Here we shall see that this inequality is realized in a critical region α>~αc of the Doniach's phase diagram where TN  ≈  TK and the Kondo scattering nearly screens out the localized moments thus reducing the Neel molecular field

[formula]

Here λ1 is the numerical factor determined by the lattice geometry.

To find the molecular field BN(T) renormalized by the Kondo scattering one should first estimate the effective exchange integral (T) entering the self-energy parts of Figs 1(a,b) (the hatched squares),

[formula]

where the asymptotic expression for the Green's function in a coordinate representation for pFR  ≫  1 and the spherical Fermi surface has the form

[formula]

the vertex part

[formula]

is the Kondo-enhanced sf-exchange integral. The simple calculation give

[formula]

where Φ(x) is the oscillatory RKKY function.

In spite of the enhancement of the indirect exchange at T > TK, the Kondo scattering eventually suppreses the AFM ordering because the same Kondo processes screen the localized spin entering the molecular field ([\ref=1b]). The screening factor (the insert K(T) at fig.1b) has the form

[formula]

within the logarithmic perturbation theory (see, e.g., [\cite=7]) and formally turns into zero at [formula]. However, this function should be corrected for the exact solution of the on-site Kondo problem [\cite=8], so the local spins are only partially screened at T approaching TK,
