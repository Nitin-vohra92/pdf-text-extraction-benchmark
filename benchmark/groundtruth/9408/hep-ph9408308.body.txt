Abstract

The S,T, and U formalism for studying electroweak precision data has recently been updated to include the effects of new light physics and within this analysis the latest LEP and SLC data tightly constrain models of physics beyond the Standard Model. We re-examine the constraints on additional strong and weakly interacting fermion families in the light of these developments. We conclude that the precision data favour models with at least one fermion with a mass below 150GeV.

The most recent precision data from LEP and SLC [\cite=data] have further tightened the constraints on models of new physics beyond the standard model. In addition the confusion between a number of different parameterizations of the observable radiative correction parameters [\cite=Peskin] [\cite=Barbieri] [\cite=Burgess1] in the literature has recently been clarified [\cite=Burgess2]. The oblique corrections from heavy physics (mnew > MZ / 2) to low energy observables on the Z pole may be parameterized by the two variables [\cite=Burgess2] [\cite=Barbieri]

[formula]

A fit to the most recent LEP and SLC data [\cite=data] performed by Caravaglios [\cite=Caravaglios] gives (with mtop  =  150GeV and mH  =  300GeV) the one standard deviation bounds

[formula]

It is not sufficient to only consider the oblique corrections to low energy observables [\cite=Kitazawa] [\cite=Barbieri]. Large non-oblique corrections to the [formula] vertex may affect the magnitude of S' and T'. This additional constraint may be measured by the parameter [\cite=Barbieri]

[formula]

where Γ0  =  379.4MeV. The experimental fit gives at one standard deviation (with mtop  =  150GeV and mH  =  300GeV)

[formula]

The bounds on S' and T' in Eqn(2) correspond to a contribution - 2.5 < B < 0.6 and thus the deviation from zero in Eqn(4) is not compatible with δΓb  =  0. Provided 0.94%  <  δΓb  /  Γ0  <  2.2% the B parameter provides no additional constraint on S' and T' beyond Eqn(2). If δΓb  /  Γ0 rises to 2.9% or falls to 0.2% then Eqn(4) over constrains S' and T' and there is no compatible solution (to one standard deviation). Since the B parameter bounds are dominated by the uncertainty in the non oblique correction δΓb we shall henceforth make the approximation that Eqn(4) places no additional constraint beyond Eqn(2) on the oblique parameters S' and T'. We note that models including additional gauge bosons with masses of a few TeV can give rise to both positive and negative contributions to B [\cite=negB] [\cite=0B] [\cite=posB] though we shall concentrate on the oblique correction bounds on additional fermions below.

In the light of these new results it is interesting to re-examine the constraints on additional strong and weakly interacting fermion families.

A Weakly Interacting Fourth Family

We consider a fourth weakly interacting family (U,D,N,E) with Dirac masses in addition to the usual fermion content of the Standard Model. In Figs 1 and 2 we show the contribution of the fourth family to the oblique parameters in the S'T' plane. The points are generated by allowing each of the fermions' masses to vary in 50GeV steps between 50 GeV (the LEP lower bound) and 500GeV and span the S'T' parameter space of fourth family models. Fig 1 shows the numerical results when all the fermions have masses ≥  150GeV. Fig 2 shows results for when at least one family member has a mass ≤  100GeV. The ellipses mark the one and two standard deviation experimental bounds. The experimental data is not incompatible with a fourth family but favours models with at least one light fermion (mf  <  150GeV).

A Technifamily

An additional strongly interacting "technifamily" [\cite=ETC] will have NTC degenerate families depending upon the strong interaction group. We shall take NTC  =  3 to demonstrate the experimental constraints. The most naive estimate of such an additional family's contribution to S' and T' is to treat the fermions as weakly interacting and is shown in Fig 3. In this approximation the experimental ellispes ly entirely within the parameter space available to such a model. The trend towards light physics is, however, enhanced relative to the single family case discussed above (and would be more so were NTC higher). We note that the technifamily spectrum

[formula]

proposed in Ref[\cite=Revenge] is still consistent in this approximation and with the new data. Ref[\cite=NJE] has demonstrated that extended technicolour models can be built consistent with the third family masses and giving rise to this spectrum.

Including the resonance effects of the strong interactions is a non-perturbative calculation, however, a number of approximations have been made in the literature [\cite=Peskin] [\cite=NLCM] [\cite=NPS]. In the isospin preserving limit a good estimate can be made by scaling low energy QCD results [\cite=Peskin] or in the non local chiral model of Ref[\cite=NLCM]. These methods are in general agreement and give

[formula]

The non local chiral model result for the T' parameter has been extended into the regime where isospin is broken [\cite=rho]. The results are dependent on the form of the fermion's dynamical self energy and hence on the precise theory of the strong interactions. Nevertheless the results ly in the range

[formula]

and we shall use these bounds to estimate T' below.

No reliable estimates for the S' parameter exist away form the isospin preserving limit but a number of extrapolations from that limit have been made based on the behaviour of the pertubative weak coupling results [\cite=Revenge] [\cite=Maj]. We shall estimate S' per doublet by the extreme values of these estimates

[formula]

In addition the family's strong interactions will give rise to light pseudo Goldstone boson bound states. In a realistic model these must have masses in excess of the LEP bound (MPGB > 43GeV). Their contributions to S,T,U,V,W and X have been calculated before [\cite=Revenge] [\cite=PGB] for a realistic range of masses. The results of these references are summerized by

[formula]

In Fig 4 we display the estimates and theoretical errors for the contributions to S' and T' for three different mass spectra. When the fermions are all heavy and degenerate the QCD scaled up solution is expected to be reliable but such a spectrum is ruled out by the experimental data. Away from the isospin preserving limit the theoretical errors are as large as the experimental errors, however, we can draw some broad conclusions. Heavy non-degenerate doublets give rise to large contributions to T' and are also ruled out by the experimental data. Spectra such as that proposed in Refs[\cite=Revenge] [\cite=NJE] with light non-degenerate lepton doublets are, however, plausibly consistent with the experimental data.

Strongly interacting models of the Higgs sector typically give rise to additional heavy gauge bosons. We note that models have been proposed which give negative [\cite=negB], zero [\cite=0B] and positive [\cite=posB] contributions to δΓB and hence the B parameter.

We conclude that recent experimental results are compatible with additional strong or weakly interacting fermion families only when those families contain one or more light fermion with mass less than 150 GeV.
