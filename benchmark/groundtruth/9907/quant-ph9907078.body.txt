It is well known that the relativistic Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation has not only ordinary (so called normal), but also the abnormal solutions [\cite=1] which have no non-relativistic analogue. Such solutions were discovered long ago in the simplest Wick-Cutkosky model [\cite=2],[\cite=3]. It should be noted that in spite of considerable effort in this direction (for details see [\cite=1]) nature of the abnormal solutions is still unclear. The only thing that is clear is that they are related to the excitations of the relative time (or, in the momentum space, relative energy) degrees of freedom. Also it is established that the norm of such solutions can become negative -- the sign of the norm is proportional to the parity of BS amplitude with respect to the relative energy which can be both positive or negative. In general case it makes quantum-mechanical (probabilistic) interpretation of the BS amplitude problematic.

The so-called quasipotential wave-function [\cite=4] is free of negative norm problem. The wave-function is defined as the equal-time BS amplitude. Amplitudes which are odd with respect to the relative energy can not survive in the equal-time limit and so only those with the positive norm survive. However, as in the BS equation there are the abnormal solutions with the positive norm too and so they have to show up in the quasipotential approach as well.

An important feature of the quasipotential approach is the dependence of the quasipotential on the total energy of the system even if the kernel of the BS equation did not depend on it. It's worth noting that excitations of the relative time degree of freedom are transformed into the energy-dependence of the quasipotential, so one can expect existence of some "extra" solutions.

The above consideration is not new [\cite=4] but theoreticians started to show interest to it for practical purposes only recently [\cite=5]-[\cite=8].

Below we will concentrate on a simple quasipotential and study the structure of its spectrum. The quasipotential equation in the single-photon exchange approximation in QED for wave function projected onto the positive-frequency states lookes like [\cite=5],[\cite=9]:

[formula]

where [formula]. We have used the center of mass frame and set the fermion masses to the same value m. Quasipotential V depends on the total mass of system M and in the O(e2) approximation has the form:

[formula]

It describes the interaction of the fermions with the opposite charges. For the fermions with the same charges we have to make the change: e2  →   - e2. On the mass-shell M = 2wp = 2wq quasipotential ([\ref=2]) coincides with the Coulomb potential.The quasipotential ([\ref=2]) is nonlocal function in general and solution of corresponding equation([\ref=1]) is very hard. In the papers [\cite=6], [\cite=10] the limit of small momenta [formula] is considered. In this approximation the quasipotential takes the following local form:

[formula]

Here E = M - 2m is the binding energy. It should be noted that different quasipotentials of a number of other models reduce to the same form [\cite=3] in the small momenta approximation where, unlike the full nonrelativistic approximation, the binding energy is keeped (see e.g. [\cite=11]).

Below we will investigate the small momenta approximation of the Eq. ([\ref=1]) with quasipotential ([\ref=2]) for negative binding energies (E =  - E < 0). The resulting Schrödinger equation in the momentum space is:

[formula]

Here α = e2 / 4π is the fine structure constant and the dependence of the potential over the binding energy is the relic of relativity. Eq. ([\ref=4]) can be studied by the standard numerical methods applicable for Fredholm type kernels but for transparency we will analyze it in the coordinate space[\cite=11] :

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

Here Ci(x) and si(x) are the integral cosine and sine, respectivly. Despite the dependence over trigonometric functions the function f(x) is a smooth and non-negative one (See fig. 1 in[\cite=12] ). It has the following asymptotics [\cite=13]:

[formula]

Here [formula] is the Euler constant. Hence for E < 0 potential ([\ref=6]) behaves like [\cite=11]:

[formula]

[formula]

Clearly, when E = 0 the potential is pure Coulombic:

[formula]

So the behavior of the potential at the infinity differs from that of the Coulombic one if we preserve the binding energy dependence in the potential. The question arises precisely in this place-whether there appear "extra" solutions of the Schrödinger equation because of presence of parameter (energy) in the potential. There are quite definite results in Quantum Mechanics for local potentials with r- 2 asymptotics [\cite=14]. Energy-dependent potentials were also investigated, but for proof usually the limit E = 0 is considered (see e.g. [\cite=15]). We can not take that limit as the asymptotic regime of potential changes drastically, but it is not difficult to show that main conclusions of the theorem from [\cite=14] remain valid in our case too. Indeed, let us study the asymtotical solution of the radial Schrödinger equation for our case:

[formula]

Here

[formula]

General solution of this equation is the superposition of the Besel functions with imaginary arguments:

[formula]

As long as we are interested in finding bound states we must choose the coefficients c1,2 so that to get vanishing behavior at spatial infinity. Such choice corresponds to the McDonald function Kν with

[formula]

and

[formula]

It is well known that the McDonald function has zeroes on real axis only for imaginary indices. So there are the following alternatives:

Let us now discuss physical consequences. According to (b) the discrete levels may arise only (see [\cite=16]) for

[formula]

At the first sight this condition can be satisfied for usual values of α,α  ≈  1 / 137. E.g. in the zone of the Balmer series where E  ≈  mα2 the left-hand-side of the first inequality in ([\ref=18]) is of the order of α- 1 and so this inequality can be satisfied. However, careful examination of the location of zeroes of the function Kν(x) reveals opposite situation. Indeed, according to the theorem 7.13.9 [\cite=16] the smallest real positive zero of the function Kν(x) for imaginary ν lies in the region x < |ν|. All asymptotic formulae [\cite=16] lead to the same conclusion for any other zeroes. So, together with γ(E) > 1 / 4 we have to impose also the following condition:

[formula]

or, equvalently

[formula]

But as long as Er  ≫  1 this new condition can not be satisfied for small reasonable values of α.

Thus, study of the asymptotic behavior of the Schrödinger equation indicates that existence of any discrete levels apart from the Coulombic ones is possible only for large values of the coupling α,i.e. in the region where the single-photon approximations becomes invalid.It is obvios,therefore,that discrete levels were not found in numerical solutions of this equation in [\cite=5]. It should be noted that the described picture is quite similar to the anomalous solutions of the BS equation. It is essential that when we neglect the binding energy in quasipotential, the regime of asymptotic behavior of the potential changes discountinously and the anomalous solutions disappear. Therefore their appearence is the consequence of the off-energy-shell effects. We are inclined to think that the main features of the results described above are valid also for non-local quasipotential ([\ref=2]). So we have showed that the above mentioned quasipotential equation is not free from the pathologies of the BS equation such as the Abnormal solutions.
