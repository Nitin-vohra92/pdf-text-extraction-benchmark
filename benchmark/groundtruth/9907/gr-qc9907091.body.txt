Introduction

Static solutions to the Einstein Yang-Mills (EYM) equations differ considerably depending on the value of the cosmological constant. The solutions can be separated into two families; Λ  ≥  0, and Λ  <  0. The solutions where Λ  =  0 were discovered by Bartnik and McKinnon (BK) [\cite=BARTNIK] and their asymptotically de Sitter (dS) analogs (Λ  >  0) were discovered independently by Volkov et. al. and Torii et. al. [\cite=VOLKOV]. The BK solutions and the cosmological extensions to them all share similar behavior and have been studied in detail (see Ref. [\cite=VOLKOV2] for a review). Recently, asymptotically anti-de Sitter (Λ  <  0) black hole solutions [\cite=WINSTANLEY] and soliton solutions [\cite=BJORAKER] were found which are strikingly different than the BK type solutions. In particular, there exist asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) solitons with no nodes in the field strength which are stable. Furthermore, in asymptotically AdS space dyon solutions are allowed.

General formalism

Given the spherically symmetric metric in the Schwarzschild gauge

[formula]

where H, p are functions of t and r, the coupled static EYM equations of motion are

[formula]

where w(r) and u(r) are the magnetic and electric components of the SU(2) Yang-Mills fields [\cite=WITTEN], H(r)  =  1  -  2m(r)  /  r  -  Λr2 / 3, v  =  G  /  4πe2 and Λ is the cosmological constant. We require that solutions to Eq.'s ([\ref=YM1]) to ([\ref=Ein2]) are regular everywhere and have finite ADM mass M  =  m(  ∞  ). The electric and magnetic charges of solutions are given by

[formula]

where w = w0  +  w1 / r  +  O(r- 2) etc.

For solutions in asymptotically flat or dS space, w(r) has at least one node [\cite=VOLKOV]. The situation is quite different in asymptotically AdS space (Λ < 0). H(r) is positive everywhere and there are solutions where w has no node.

Monopole solutions

The solutions to Eq.'s ([\ref=YM1]) to ([\ref=Ein2]), for Λ  <  0, were evaluated numerically [\cite=BJORAKER] using the shooting method. In the shooting method one solves Eqs. ([\ref=YM1]) to ([\ref=Ein2]) at r = 0 in terms of two parameters, a and b, and 'shoots' for solutions with the desired asymptotic behavior. a and b are adjustable parameters which together specify the boundary conditions at the origin for w, u, H, and p: [formula] and [formula] near r = 0.

Purely magnetic solutions (monopoles) are found by setting a = 0, corresponding to u(r) = 0. A continuum of monopole solutions were obtained by varying the parameter b. The solutions are similar to the black hole solutions found by Ref. [\cite=WINSTANLEY], but are also regular for all r. The number of times w crosses the axis depends on the value of the adjustable shooting parameter b.

As shown in fig. 1, the behavior of m and p is similar to that of the asymptotically dS solutions previously considered [\cite=VOLKOV]. In contrast, there exist solutions where w has no nodes, which are not seen in the asymptotically dS or Minkowski cases.

Dyon solutions

Dyon solutions to the EYM equations for a given negative Λ are found if we choose the adjustable shooting parameter a to be non-zero. Fig. [\ref=m_plot] shows how the electric component, u, of the EYM equations starts at zero and monotonically increases to some finite value. The behavior of w, m , H, and p is similar to the monopole solutions.

Again we find a continuum of solutions for a continuous set of parameters a and b, where w crosses the axis an arbitrary number of times depending these parameters. Also similar to the monopole solutions is the existence of solutions where w does not cross the axis. This is in sharp contrast to the Λ  ≥  0 case where the dyon solutions are forbidden.

Stability of the monopole solutions

The BK solutions and the dS-EYM solutions are unstable [\cite=ZHOU] [\cite=Volkov4] [\cite=BRODBECK]. In contrast, the AdS black hole solutions [\cite=WINSTANLEY] with u = 0 and the monopole solutions without nodes[\cite=BJORAKER] are stable against spherically symmetric linear fluctuations.

In order to derive the time dependent EYM equations, we use the most general expression for the spherically symmetric SU(2) gauge fields in the singular gauge:

[formula]

where τi (i = 1,2,3) are the usual Pauli matrices and u, ν, w and w̃ depend on r and t. The boundary conditions u = ν = 0 and w2  +  w̃2  =  1 at r = 0 ensure regularity at the origin. Linearized equations when u(t,r) = 0, for the gauge fields δw(t,r), δw̃(t,r), δν(t,r), δp(t,r), and δH(t,r) have been derived in the literature [\cite=VOLKOV2]. Fluctuations decouple in terms of δw(t,r), δp(t,r), and δH(t,r) which form even-parity perturbations, and in terms of δw̃(t,r) and δν(t,r) which form odd-parity perturbations.

The equation for parity-odd perturbations in β  =  r2pδν   /   w, where β(t,r)  =  e- iωtβ(r), is [\cite=BJORAKER]

[formula]

where dρ   /   dr  =  p  /  H. Volkov et al.  showed that for the BK solutions there appear exactly n negative eigenmodes (ω2 < 0) if w has n nodes [\cite=Volkov4]. Their argument applies to the asymptotically AdS case without modification. One concludes that the solutions with nodes in w are unstable against parity-odd perturbations.

For parity-even perturbations, where δw(t,r)  =  e- iωtδw(r), we find the equation

[formula]

Although the potential Uw(ρ) is not positive definite, it is regular in the entire range 0  ≤  ρ  ≤  ρ max. The first term in Uw becomes negative for w2  <  1 / 3. The Schrödinger equation ([\ref=U_w]) was solved numerically [\cite=BJORAKER]. The potential for the solutions with (a,b) = (0,0.001), which has no node in w, has the lowest eigenvalue ω2 of 0.028 and for (a,b) = (0,0.005), which has one node, has the lowest eigenvalue of 0.023. Therefore, these solutions are stable against parity-even perturbations, even if w has one node, and differ from the solutions where Λ  ≥  0 where the parity-even perturbations are always unstable.

Conclusion

A continuum of new monopole and dyon solutions to the asymptotically AdS EYM equations have been found. In fig. 2 the spectrum of monopole solutions is plotted. The monopole solutions in which the magnetic component w(r) of the gauge fields never vanishes, corresponding to the portion with n = 0 in fig. 2, were shown to be stable against linear perturbations. Solutions with b  ≥  0.7 develop an event horizon, becoming black holes. The end point of the n = 3 portion of the curve in fig. 2 shows where the solutions become black holes.
