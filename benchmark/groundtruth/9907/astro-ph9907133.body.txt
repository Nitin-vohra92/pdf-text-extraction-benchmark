The energy spectrum of extra high energy cosmic rays (EHECRs) above 1010 eV can be divided into three regions: two "knees" and one "ankle" [\cite=Yo]. The first "knee" appears around 3  ×  1015 eV where the spectral power law index changes from - 2.7 to - 3.0. The second "knee" is somewhere between 1017 eV and 1018 eV where the spectral slope steepens from - 3.0 to around - 3.3. The "ankle" is seen in the region of 3  ×  1018 eV above which the spectral slope flattens out to about - 2.7.

Consider the structure of the EHECRs spectrum in view of the decay of proton. The lifetime of proton relative to the decay of proton at the scale of the mass M is given by

[formula]

From this the time required for proton travel from the source to the earth defines the limiting energy of proton

[formula]

Within the time t, protons with the energies more than the limiting energy E > Elim decay and do not give contribution in the EHECRs spectrum.

Let us assume that proton decays at the Planck scale mPl = 1.2  ×  1019 GeV. Determine the range of the limiting energies of proton depending on the range of distances to the EHECRs sources. Take the maximum and minimum distances to the source as the size of the universe and the thickness of our galactic disc respectively. For the lifetime of the universe tU = 1.06  ×  1018 s [\cite=Kh1], the limiting energy is equal to EU = 6.7  ×  1015 eV. This corresponds to the first "knee" in the EHECRs spectrum. For the thickness of our galactic disc ≃300 pc, the limiting energy is equal to EG = 1.1  ×  1018 eV. This corresponds to the second "knee" in the EHECRs spectrum. Thus the range of the limiting energies of proton due to the decay of proton at the Planck scale lies between the first "knee" E  ~  3  ×  1015 eV and the second "knee" E  ~  1017 - 1018 eV.

From the above consideration it follows that the decrease of the spectral power law index from - 2.7 to - 3.0 at the first "knee" E  ~  3  ×  1015 eV and from - 3.0 to around - 3.3 at the second "knee" E  ~  1017 - 1018 eV can be explained as a result of the decay of proton at the Planck scale. From this it seems natural that, below the "ankle" E < 3  ×  1018 eV, the EHECRs events are mainly caused by the protons. Above the "ankle" E > 3  ×  1018 eV, the EHECRs events are caused by the particles other than protons.
