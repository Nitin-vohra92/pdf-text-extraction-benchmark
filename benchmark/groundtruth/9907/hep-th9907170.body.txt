Introduction

Supersymmetric soliton solutions have been at the centre of a great deal of study. In general these solitons are stable due to their saturation of a topological bound which is a consequence of the existence of preserved supersymmetries and an exact force cancellation between the various fields. In the case of a non-Abelian monopole for example, the Bogomol'nyi condition relates the scalar Higgs field to the magnetic field. The quantum corrections to these states are also under greater control and therefore their properties can often be deduced in the complete quantum theory.

In recent years the focus in String Theory has moved to branes where M-Theory provides an elegant and unifying framework. M-Theory possess just two branes in flat spacetime and the M-fivebrane is particularly interesting since it has a gauge field on its worldvolume. In contrast to other branes, this gauge field is a self-dual two-form. The various Dp-branes and the NS-fivebrane in ten-dimensional II string theory are related to the M-fivebrane by dimensional reduction and T-duality.

The scalar fields that occur in the low energy dynamics describe the way a brane is embedded in spacetime and as a consequence the corresponding Bogomol'nyi conditions will determine the geometry of this embedding. In studies of brane solitons in the absence of a gauge fields it has been found that the resulting geometries have an elegant interpretation as calibrated manifolds [\cite=BeBeSt95] [\cite=BBMOOY96] [\cite=GibPap98] [\cite=GaLaWe98a] [\cite=AcOFSp98].

This has led to a search for a generalised notion of calibrations to include solitons with active worldvolume gauge fields [\cite=GaLaWe98b]. In [\cite=GuPa99] [\cite=GuPaTo99] the notion of a calibration was extended to cases where there is a background spacetime gauge field. In this paper we will use the covariant superembedding approach to construct a general Bogomol'nyi bound on the energy-momentum of an M-fivebrane. This bound naturally suggests a generalised definition of a calibration for cases when the worldvolume gauge field is present. Finally we mention how this bound can be dimensionally reduced to the worldvolume of a Dp-brane.

An Energy-Momentum Bound

An M-fivebrane is described by its embedding coordinates [formula],   =  0,1,2,...,10, and Θα, α  =  1,2,3,...,32, as well as a two-form gauge field Bmn, m,n = 0,1,2,...,5, with field strength H = dB which lives on its six-dimensional worldvolume. In static gauge one identifies the worldvolume coordinates with the first six coordinates of spacetime and sets half of the Fermions to zero. This leaves five scalar modes Xn', n' = 6,7,8,9,10, describing the transverse coordinates and sixteen Fermions Θ iα. These are USp(4) symplectic Majorana-Weyl spinors with α = 1,2,3,4, i = 1,2,3,4. In what follows we will omit the spinor indices for simplicity.

In the superembedding formalism the residual supersymmetry transformation after setting half of the Fermions to zero takes the form [\cite=GaLaWe98a] [\cite=GaLaWe98b]

[formula]

where Γ2 = 1. We can therefore define a projector [formula] whose kernel consists of the preserved supersymmetries of a given bosonic field configuration. Out of ([\ref=susy]) one can construct a manifestly positive definite object

[formula]

which on physical grounds is expected to lead to a bound on the energy involving the central charges of the fivebrane supersymmetry algebra.

Evaluating the bound of ([\ref=prebound]) one finds that the energy does not naturally occur unless Hmnp = 0. As such it is difficult to interpret the bound arising from the variation of the fermion of equation ([\ref=susy]). A way out of this dilemma is to recognise that ([\ref=prebound]) contains a hidden ambiguity; the Θ arise as half of the Grassmann coordinates of the background superspace and since these are merely coordinates, we are free to make another choice. The new Fermions will have a different supervariation and therefore lead to a new bound.

We start by performing a field redefinition

[formula]

for some invertible, field dependent matrix M. The new Fermions Ψ will transform as

[formula]

where the ellipses denote terms which vanish after we set the Fermions to zero. From ([\ref=prebound]) we are led to the positive quantity

[formula]

Our aim is now to find a matrix M such that ([\ref=genbound]) does give a natural bound on the energy for a generic fivebrane configuration. From this new bound we will be able to derive a notion of a generalised calibration which holds in the presence of worldvolume gauge fields.

We now turn to the technical task of determining the matrix M and the exact form of the resulting bound. First let us describe in more detail the M-fivebrane dynamics [\cite=HoSeWe97a]. These were derived from the superembeding formalism when applied to the M-fivebrane [\cite=HowSez97]. The physical three-form field is H, which is closed. However, it is constrained to satisfy a non-linear self-duality condition. To describe this condition it is helpful to introduce a three-form habc which is self-dual

[formula]

where we used tangent frame indices [formula]. These are related to the world indices [formula], by the usual vielbein e am constructed from the induced metric which in static gauge is given by

[formula]

Later we will need the explicit connection associated with this metric which is given by

[formula]

Self-duality implies that the only covariant tensors one can construct out of h are given by

[formula]

since [formula]. One then defines the physical (closed) three-form field Habc as

[formula]

The self-duality condition on habc now implies that (kh)abc is anti-self-dual resulting in

[formula]

With these definitions the energy-momentum can be written as [\cite=us]

[formula]

and in particular the energy is, for a static configuration, given by

[formula]

which agrees with the action formulation [\cite=BLNPST97b].

The worldvolume Γ-matrices are the pull-backs of the flat eleven-dimensional [formula]-matrices and in static gauge are given as

[formula]

But for our calculation it will be more convenient to use these Γ-matrices referred to tangent frame Γa  =  e maΓm; here they obey the standard property {Γa,Γb}  =  2ηab and as a consequence also the duality relation

[formula]

We may now write the matrix Γ that appears in the supersymmetry projector PΘ ([\ref=susy]) as [\cite=HoSeWe97a]

[formula]

Furthermore, the M-fivebrane itself preserves supersymmetries such that ε(1 - 012345)  =  0.

Returning to the matrix M, the most general covariant form that can be constructed from the fields of the M-fivebrane is given by

[formula]

where [formula] and a,b,c and d are functions of Q which are to be determined. To proceed we need the basic matrices in a more explicit way. Using self-duality of h, anti-self-duality of (kh) and the duality relation for the Γ-matrices one finds

[formula]

here [formula] denote tangent indices running from 1 to 5. We need three additional identities

[formula]

A short calculation then reveals

[formula]

We are only concerned with static configurations which implies

[formula]

Furthermore one has {Γ0ij,Γ012345} = 0. Hence we find the conjugate of ([\ref=poldM]) to be

[formula]

Evaluating the product and sorting the resulting terms gives

[formula]

Making the choice [formula] leads to

[formula]

where we have identified the components of the energy-momentum tensor ([\ref=EMtensor]). So for this choice of constants we obtain the following bound on the energy

[formula]

which is the same as found in [\cite=GaLaWe98b] if we identify ti = Pi. It is gratifying to see that the three-form automatically appears in the guise of the dual of the physical field Habc. Note that the left hand side of ([\ref=EMb]) is simply

[formula]

where   =  εΓ0 and Pm  =  T 0m is the six-momentum density. Spatial integration of equation ([\ref=EMb]) leads to a manifestly covariant form for the bound in terms of the Noether charges.

In an earlier work [\cite=us] we found that the associated energy momentum tensor is covariantly conserved

[formula]

We are now going to show that this tensor gives rise to a tensor density

[formula]

which is conserved in the flat space sense

[formula]

Thus the total energy and momentum of the M-fivebrane are indeed conserved quantities.

The equation of motion for the scalar fields of the fivebrane in static gauge and for a flat background is given by [\cite=HoSeWe97a]

[formula]

Here Gmn = QTmn [\cite=us] so this can be rewritten as

[formula]

where we used the fact that Tmn is covariantly conserved. Using standard tensor analysis we find that the equation of motion can be written as

[formula]

Hence to prove our initial statement we have to show that the second term vanishes. This is equivalent to showing that the equation of motion implies Gmn∂m∂nXa' = 0. Starting from ([\ref=EOM]) we calculate

[formula]

A short calculation reveals that the inverse of the matrix [formula] exists and is given by

[formula]

Thus it follows that [formula] if and only if Gmn∂m∂nXa' = 0.

Returning to the bound it turns out that for any choice of a,b,c and d, the matrix (1 - Γ)M squares to a multiple of itself

[formula]

Hence the variation of the new Fermions under worldvolume supersymmetry can be rewritten in the form

[formula]

where we defined

[formula]

Choosing [formula] as before we find from ([\ref=poldM])

[formula]

the remaining constants drop out and we are led to a unique new projector. If we express PΨ in a more familiar way we find

[formula]

In principle one can now forget about M and simply take PΨ to be the new supersymmetry projector associated with the new set of Fermions Ψ. A short calculation gives two relations fulfilled by PΨ and [formula]

[formula]

These relations imply that [formula] and PΨ have the same zero modes, recall that they act from the right, and that the image of one is related by an invertible, linear transformation to the image of the other. Therefore the Bogomol'nyi conditions for the preservation of supersymmetry are identical. Although a similar equation was obtained in [\cite=BLNPST97b] in terms of PΘ and the supersymmetry projector PPST of the action formulation, it is easily seen that PPST  ≠  PΨ since the former is Hermitian whereas the latter is not.

Our final task is to ensure that M is invertible. In fact it is easy to establish that this is generically the case for any values of a,b,c,d. A particularly simple choice is to take a = 0,b = 1,c = 0 so that [formula] and

[formula]

with M2 = 1.

Generalised Calibrations

In the previous section we showed that there is a bound on the energy-momentum of a static M-fivebrane configuration which is saturated precisely when supersymmetry is preserved. For the purely scalar case it is know that the right hand side of the bound corresponds to a calibrating form and that supersymmetric states can be interpreted as an M-fivebrane wrapped on a calibrated submanifold of eleven-dimensional spacetime. In this section we would like to find a similar spacetime interpretation in terms of a "generalised calibration" when H  ≠  0.

Let us restrict our attention to static configurations that have a rest frame where Pi = T0i = 0. We are also only interested in the spatial section of the M-fivebrane worldvolume. Let us introduce the five-form φ and two-form χ defined as

[formula]

where μ1,μ2,μ3... = 1,2,3,...,10 and we choose to normalise our spinors such that εε† = 1. These forms are defined over the entire ten-dimensional space in which the M-fivebrane sits. Furthermore, since they are constant, they are closed. The bound on the total energy now can be written as

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the pull-back to the spatial part of the M-fivebrane worldvolume M. Here we see that the role of χ is to pick out preferred three-cycles in the worldvolume over which the flux of H is measured. Note that only the spatial components of H contribute to E.

This very suggestive form for the bound motivates the following definition of a generalised calibration, valid for an arbitrary background spacetime: A generalised calibration consists of a closed five-form φ, together with a closed two-form χ such that, for all submanifolds M with a three-form H defined on it,

[formula]

when evaluated on any tangent plane. Here dvol is the volume form and E is given by ([\ref=Energy]). A particular pair (M,H) consisting of a five-dimensional submanifold M and a three-form H is then said to be calibrated by (φ,χ) if the inequality is saturated on all tangent planes of M. Clearly for H = 0 then E = 1 and ([\ref=calform]) reduces to the standard definition of a calibrating form. This leads to the theorem: A calibrated pair (M,H) has minimal energy E with respect to all other pairs (M',H') such that M - M' = ∂N, for some manifold N and H = H' on ∂M = ∂M'. This is easily established from the closure of φ,χ and Stokes theorem as in the analogous proof for standard calibrations

[formula]

where we have written B' = B + dΛ on ∂M. Thus a calibrated pair minimises the energy and therefore solves the M-fivebrane equations of motion.

Although the right hand side of ([\ref=Ebound]) seems quite simple the form for E given in equation ([\ref=Energy]) is rather complicated. However the this form is necessary for the existence of calibrated M-fivebranes and we therefore suspect that there is a deeper geometrical significance to E which would be interesting to understand. Furthermore the presence of preserved supersymmetries implies the existence of reduced holonomy in spacetime. However if the preserved supersymmetries and in particular their Bogomol'nyi conditions rely on gauge fields, either on the worldvolume or in spacetime, then the reduced holonomy is not with respect to the Levi-Civita connection but rather a connection that sees the relevant gauge structure. It might be interesting to find a classification of all reduced holonomies and the geometries that result from the corresponding generalised calibrations.

We may further generalise the notion of a calibration to include the case where [formula] as in [\cite=GuPa99] [\cite=GuPaTo99] and also for dH  ≠  0. These cases correspond to a non-zero four-form field strength G = dC in eleven dimensions. In this case we may write [formula] where [formula] is the pull-back of C and [formula] [\cite=HowSez97]. The above argument is altered to

[formula]

Following [\cite=GuPa99] [\cite=GuPaTo99] we may interpret the additional term as the contribution of a Wess-Zumino term to the total energy. To see this we observe that the modified bound ([\ref=wzbound]) can be writen as

[formula]

where

[formula]

and Φ is an static gauge potential defined by dΦ  =  F.

In practice many soliton solutions of the M-fivebrane are r-branes where the scalars and three-form only depend on q  =  5 - r of the spatial dimensions. In this case the forms φ and χ are more naturally interpreted as a q-form and (q - 3)-form respectively

[formula]

Furthermore we are now interested in the energy per unit r-volume and so only the components of H tangent to the xr + 1,...,x5 dimensions appear in the bound. The definition of a calibration follows analogously and it is clear that the above theorem still holds for q-dimensional submanifolds M.

There are already many examples of solitons on the M-fivebrane which are supersymmetric with a non-zero H [\cite=HoLaWe98] [\cite=GaLaWe98b] [\cite=LamWes98c] [\cite=GaKhMaTo99] [\cite=Gauntlett99] [\cite=GoRaSiTo99]. These therefore provide examples of generalised calibrations as defined above. Perhaps the simplest example is the self-dual string soliton [\cite=HoLaWe98] with q = 4. This soliton has

[formula]

where r2  =  xixi, i = 2,3,4,5 and all other fields vanish. The preserved supersymmetries satisfy ε016 =  - ε and

[formula]

The energy for this configuration is [\cite=GaGoTo98]

[formula]

whereas the forms [formula] and [formula] are

[formula]

From this and the normalisation εε† = 1 we see that the calibration condition ([\ref=calform]) is indeed saturated.

Finally let us describe how this definition of a generalised calibration is modified when we dimensionally reduce the M-fivebrane to D-fourbrane. To this end we consider configurations for which the x5 direction is an isometry. It was shown in [\cite=HoSeWe97a] that the M-fivebrane equations of motion reduce to those of a D-fourbrane (with a Dirac-Born-Infeld action) if the direction x5 is compactified. Thus if we consider solitons which do not depend on x5 and write for m,n = 0,1,2,3,4 [\cite=HoSeWe97a]

[formula]

then we find the generalised calibration may be expressed as

[formula]

which now includes contributions from both electric and magnetic charges. Here [formula] is the Hodge dual on the D-fourbrane, ω =  - ε0μ5ε†dxμ and [\cite=HoSeWe97b]

[formula]

Here F appears with one raised and one lowered index and matrix multiplication is understood. In terms of the D-fourbrane fields we may write [formula], where (g + F)mn is the matrix inverse of gmn + Fmn. It follows from the Dirac-Born-Infeld equation of motion that [formula], as we expect. The generalisation to all Dp-branes with a Dirac-Born-Infeld effective action is clear. Equation ([\ref=BIbound]) stills applies but now the generalised calibration depends on a p-form φ, (p - 2)-form χ and a one-form ω. In all these cases an analogous theorem exists for a bound on the energy.
