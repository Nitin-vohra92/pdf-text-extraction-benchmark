Interactions of quarkonium at low energies

and D. Kharzeev

INTRODUCTION

The heavy quarkonium (for which we will use a generic notation Φ) has a small size (r  ~  1 / (αsmQ)) and a large binding energy (ε  ~  α2smQ). When we consider an interaction with light hadrons (h,h') at a low (compared to ε) energy, the amplitude can be expanded in multipoles [\cite=pQCD] [\cite=BP] [\cite=Kai]: [formula], where ci are the Wilson coefficients (polarizabilities) which reflect the structure of the quarkonium. The matrix elements of the gauge-invariant local operators Oi(x) over the light hadron state contain the information about the long distance part of the process; we assume that the factorization scale in this formula is ε.

This approach has been applied to the evaluation of inclusive cross sections of heavy quarkonium dissociation in hadron gas in [\cite=KS]. Here we evaluate exclusive cross sections of πΦ interactions. Previously these interactions were addressed in Refs. [\cite=DK] [\cite=SSZ] [\cite=CS]; detailed description of our formalism and results can be found in Ref. [\cite=FK].

The leading operator in OPE for the amplitude is [formula], which describes the emission of two gluons in the color-singlet state. (The magnetic coupling is suppressed by the velocity v  ~  αs  ≪  1 for a heavy Φ.) One can re-write this operator in the Lorentz covariant form, [formula]. As will be discussed below, the scale anomaly implies that the matrix elements of the stress tensor, θμμ =  - (9g2 / 32π2)(Gaμν)2 do not depend on the coupling g2 and dominate over the matrix elements of the gluon tensor operator, θ(G)00, which is manifestly suppressed by g2. In other words, scale anomaly effectively eliminates the factor of g2 in the amplitude!

πΦ INTERACTIONS

Let us consider Φ interactions with pions, which are the dominant degrees of freedom at low energies/temperatures. Since θμμ is scale invariant, we can match it onto its expression in terms of the effective pion lagrangian, and find a beautiful relation [\cite=matching] 〈π+(p')|θμμ|π+(p)〉 = (p' - p)2 = t valid in the chiral limit. In the leading order in OPE, the amplitude of the πΦ elastic scattering can be written as

[formula]

where, in the polarizability 2a20  /  ε0, we have factored out the Bohr radius a0 and the Rydberg energy ε0 of quarkonium, respectively; F(t) is the pion formfactor in the scalar-isoscalar channel, which takes account of the resonances in this channel.

The resulting elastic cross section of Φ with mass M

[formula]

appears to be very small (see Fig. 1) because of the factor a40  /  ε20 stemming from the double-dipole nature of the interaction. Moreover, it is further suppressed by the dependence on the momentum transfer t of the cross section dictated by the chiral symmetry.

In Fig. [\ref=fig1] we show the πΦ elastic cross section for the J / ψ case; one can see that the cross section is very small. This result implies that the J / ψ's produced in heavy ion collisions interact with the surrounding π gas very weakly. The pT broadening of the Φ's by the interactions inside the pion gas therefore is negligible.

Next we consider the inelastic excitation process, πΦ  →  πΦ'. The energy transfer in this process is on the order of the binding energy, Δ = M' - M = O(ε0), which may invalidate our starting assumption of the factorization. Fortunately the double-dipole form is intact, but non-local in time. We replace the gluon energy appearing in the energy denominator with the typical value, Δ, as an approximation, to make the gluonic operator local:

[formula]

where the φ (φ') is the internal wave function of Φ (Φ'), and Ha(r) is the effective hamiltonian describing the intermediate, SU(Nc) color-adjoint quark-anti-quark state. With this amplitude we get the transition cross section shown in Fig. 2.

Our replacement of the gluon energy in the energy denominator is an approximation with an accuracy that cannot be evaluated a priori. We can, however, apply our formula to the decay process ψ'  →  J / ψππ and compare our results, Γππ=260 (70) keV obtained with (without) taking account of the formfactor F(s), with the experimentally measured value of 135±  20 keV. From this comparison we conclude that our calculations are probably valid up to a factor of 2.

Our results support the idea [\cite=MS1] [\cite=KS] that the interactions of heavy quarkonia in the hadron gas and in the quark-gluon plasma are very different.

ONIUM-ONIUM SCATTERING AT LOW ENERGY

Low-energy onium-onium scattering is a very interesting subject, which was addressed by several authors [\cite=Ap] [\cite=BP] [\cite=BM]. One may regard this problem as a first step toward the understanding of nuclear force from QCD. Here we derive a sum rule for this interaction [\cite=FK].

After the multipole expansion for the interactions of both Φ's with the gluon field is performed, the potential between them can be expressed through the θμμ correlator:

[formula]

where we have introduced the spectral function for the θμμ correlator as [formula] with the coordinate-space scalar Feynman propagator, ΔF; b = (11Nc - 2Nf) / 3 = 9.

An important theorem [\cite=nsvz] for the θμμ correlator relates it to the non-perturbative energy density of the QCD vacuum:

[formula]

Since the vacuum energy density is divergent in perturbation theory, we define the r.h.s. by subtracting the perturbative part. This relates the integral of the spectral density to εvac as [formula]. In the heavy quark limit, this relation leads to the following sum rule for the potential

[formula]

where r is the size of the onium. This sum rule relates the overall strength of the interaction between the dipoles to the energy density of the QCD vacuum.

The short- and long-distance limits of the potential are analyzed in Ref. [\cite=FK]. In particular, it appears that the long-distance limit of the potential has an interesting R dependence, ~  R- 5 / 2exp( - 2μπR) (μπ is the pion mass), with a non-trivial dependence on the numbers of colors Nc and flavors Nf, ~  (N2f - 1)2 / (11Nc  -  2Nf)2.
