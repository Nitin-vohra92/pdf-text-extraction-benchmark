The Ramanujan Property for Regular Cubical Complexes

Proposition A variant Corollary Definition Example Examples Conditions Remark Remarks Lemma Main Theorem

Introduction

Ramanujan graphs were defined by Lubotzky, Phillips, and Sarnak in [\cite=LPS] as regular graphs whose adjacency matrices, or their laplacians, have eigenvalues satisfying some "best possible" bounds. Such graphs possess many interesting properties. In this paper we will give a higher dimensional generalization of this theory to regular cubical complexes. By definition, [formula]-regular complexes are cell complexes locally isomorphic to the (ordered) product of g regular trees, with the jth tree of regularity rj  ≥  3. Each cell is an i-cube (i.e., an i-dimensional cube) with 0  ≤  i  ≤  g. Throughout each (g - 1)-cube exactly one of the tree factors, say the jth one, is constant, and there are rj g-cubes passing through it. When g = 1 we simply have an r-regular graph.

The spaces of i-cochains Ci(X) (with real or complex coefficients) of a finite cubical complex X are inner product vector spaces with an orthonormal basis corresponding to the characteristic functions of the i-cells. There are partial boundary operators ∂j  =  ∂j,i:Ci(X)  →  Ci + 1(X) for 1  ≤  j  ≤  g. With these we get the adjoint operators [formula], and hence the partial laplacians

[formula]

Each [formula] is a self-adjoint nonnegative operator. For i fixed they all commute, and one gets a combinatorial harmonic theory (compare [\cite=St]).

When X is infinite, these notions extend to [formula]-cochains. When [formula] is an [formula]-regular product of trees, Kesten's 1-dimensional results [\cite=Kes] extend and we get that each λ in the spectrum of [formula] acting on [formula]-cochains of [formula], satisfies [formula]. As in the 1-dimensional case we say that a [formula]-regular cubical complex X is Ramanujan if the eigenvalues of [formula] on X are ±  rj or satisfy the same properties for each j.

One justification for this definition in the 1-dimensional case is the Alon-Boppana result, which shows that these bounds are essentially the best possible for the trivial local system. We generalize this result under a natural hypothesis. Another parallel with the 1-dimensional case is that when X is finite, connected, and uniformized by a lattice Γ in a product [formula] of p-adic [formula]'s, the Ramanujan property is equivalent to the following condition. For a (g - 1)-cube σ in the universal covering complex, which is constant in the jth direction, let Γσ be the stabilizer of σ in Γ. Then no nontrivial unramified complementary series representations should appear in [formula] for any j and σ.

A fundamental problem in the 1-dimensional case is to construct explicitly an infinite family of Ramanujan graphs of a fixed regularity. The only such families known have regularities of the form k = q + 1, with q a power of a prime. The standard LPS examples ([\cite=LPS]) depend in fact on the Ramanujan-Petersson conjectures for weight 2 holomorphic cusp forms on [formula]. These were reduced to the Weil bounds for curves by Eichler, Shimura, and Igusa. They only give examples with q a prime. The case of any prime power was subsequently handled in [\cite=Mor] via function fields. Ramanujan local systems were defined and constructed in [\cite=JL6] with q a prime. This construction requires Deligne's results on the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture for cusp forms of higher weight. They depend on the Weil bounds for higher dimensional varieties.

In the higher dimensional case a product of Ramanujan graphs always gives a Ramanujan cubical complex, and the problem is to construct irreducible examples. In this work we construct infinite families of Ramanujan regular cubical complexes, with fixed regularities [formula], where rj  =  qj + 1 and the qj's are any prime powers. As in the LPS examples, our construction uses quaternion algebras, this time over totally real number fields. It reduces the Ramanujan property to the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture for certain holomorphic Hilbert modular forms. The Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture seems not to be known for all holomorphic Hilbert modular forms. In particular, the results of [\cite=BL] do not help us, because they establish the bounds outside a finite set of primes which is inexplicit, and a priori may depend on the form. However, in the literature this conjecture is proved under additional hypotheses, which still permit us to construct infinite families of examples with arbitrary prime powers for regularities. If all the qj's are powers of the same prime, one could give, as before, an alternate construction using function fields. As in [\cite=JL6], we also construct Ramanujan local systems on our examples. Among the interesting features of our examples is the fact that their cohomology vanishes except in the top dimension g (and 0). In addition, one can bound the girth from below as in the 1-dimensional case ([\cite=Lub].

As in [\cite=JL6], this theory is valid for hermitian local systems over cubical complexes. We similarly give examples of Ramanujan local systems on cubical complexes.

The harmonic theory of regular cubical complexes

. Cubical complexes In this article we will study cell complexes locally isomorphic to a finite product of regular trees, in which the order and the regularities of the factors are globally constant.

Let g be the dimension of such a complex X, and let rj be the regularity of the jth factor tree (1  ≤  j  ≤  g). We will call such a complex X an [formula]-regular cubical complex. Each cell in X is a cube of dimension ≤  g. The 0-dimensional cells are called vertices and the 1-dimensional cells are called edges.

For each subset [formula], the I-cubes, or cubes of direction I of X, are the products of edges from the factors i∈I with vertices from the factors not in I. Each such cube has 2|I| orientations, and we denote the set of oriented I-cubes by ΣI. There are bottom and top maps botj,topj:ΣI  →  ΣI  -  {j} and inversion maps invj:ΣI  →  ΣI for any j∈I. These are subject to the following axioms:

{invj}j∈I generate a group, isomorphic to the group [formula] of maps from I to [formula], which acts simply transitively on the orientations of each I-cube.

topjinvj'  =  invj'topj and botjinvj'  =  invj'botj for j  ≠  j'.

topjinvj  =  botj (and hence also botjinvj  =  topj) for all j.

Any oriented I-cube is the jth top of precisely rj oriented [formula]-cubes for [formula].

Geometrically, these combinatorial conditions mean that X is locally isomorphic to the ordered product [formula] of g regular trees of respective regularities rj. In particular, when X is connected these conditions hold if and only if the universal cover [formula] is isomorphic to [formula], with the covering transformations preserving the order of the tree factors. The if part is clear, and the only if part holds because [formula] is simply connected (in fact, explicitly contractible), and locally isomorphic to X. Hence [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] by the uniqueness of the universal cover. The directions are preserved under the covering map, and hence the deck transformations form indeed a subgroup of [formula].

We set [formula], [formula], and [formula]. For an oriented edge e of direction {j} we write botj(e) = o(e), topj(e) = t(e), and [formula]. We will refer to these as the the origin, the terminal vertex, and the oppposite edge respectively. If necessary we will indicate the dependence of all these objects on X.

A connected regular cubical complex is called irreducible if it has no finite unramified cover by a product of regular cubical complexes of positive dimension.

In many important cases, the vertices of an [formula]-regular cubical complex X come with parities: these are maps pj from the vertices to {0,1} which satisfy pj(topie)  =  pj(botie) if and only if i  ≠  j for any edge e of direction {i} of X, 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  g. On a complex with parities we give each cube a canonical orientation by agreeing that its bottom-most vertex has all its parities equal to 0. In the 1-dimensional case we recover the notion of a bipartite graph.

. Local systems A real/complex local system, or a flat vector bundle, on a regular cubical complex X depends only on the cells of dimension ≤  2. For the 1-dimensional case, see, e.g., [\cite=JL6]. In the general case, a local system L on X consists of a real/complex vector space L(v) for any vertex v of X. In addition, for any oriented edge e one is given a linear isomorphism Le:L(o(e))  →  L(t(e)) so that [formula]. The Le's must also satisfy the flatness condition: for any 2-cell of direction {j,j'} in X we require

[formula]

The local system is metrized if each fiber L(v) is a finite dimensional (positive definite) inner product space and all transition maps Le are isometries. The (metrized) trivial local system TV, for a finite dimensional (inner product) vector space V, has all fibers V and all transition maps the identity. Over a contractible space all local systems admit a trivialization, i.e., an isomorphism to some TV. The notions of maps and direct sums make sense for (metrized) local systems over a fixed space (see, e.g., [\cite=JL6]). A local system is irreducible if it is not the direct sum of nonzero local systems. Every metrized local system is the direct sum of irreducible ones and a sub local system has an orthogonal complement.

Let X1, X2 be regular cubical complexes with (metrized) local systems Li on Xi. The product X  =  X1  ×  X2 is naturally a regular cubical complex on which we have a (metrized) local system [formula], called the external product of the Li's. It is irreducible if and only if both Li's are irreducible, and if X1 and X2 are connected, then any irreducible local system on X is an external product.

Let X be a connected regular cubical complex and let v0 be a base vertex. The universal cover [formula] is a product of regular trees [formula], and the fundamental group Π  =  π1(X,v0) is discrete in [formula] which acts properly on [formula] with quotient X. (Metrized) local systems L on X are equivalent to (orthogonal or unitary) representations [formula] of Π on L(v0). We reconstruct L as [formula].

A similar construction is possible in the disconnected case: if Π acts freely on a regular cubical complex [formula] preserving directions, and ρ is an (orthogonal or unitary) representation of Π on V, then the quotient [formula] is again a regular cubical complex and we get a (metrized) local system [formula]. One gets this way all local systems on X whose pullback to [formula] is trivial.

. Cochains Let X be an [formula]-regular cubical complex and let L be a local system on X. For a subset [formula] and σ∈ΣI denote by o(σ) the iterated bottom vertex [formula], and for j∈I let ej(σ) be the oriented edge of direction {j} defined by [formula]. By the combinatorial conditions these are well defined, i.e., do not depend on the order of the operations. Now set L(σ) = L(o(σ)) and Lσ,j  =  Lej(σ). By definition, the space of I-cochains CI(X,L) is the space of completely alternating collections

[formula]

The condition of being completely alternating is vacuous for 0-cochains. Otherwise, a collection s as above is completely alternating if for any j∈I we have s(invj(σ))  =    -  Lσ,js(σ). For L  =  TV we can view the I-cochains as maps from ΣI to V.

For an integer 0  ≤  i  ≤  g put [formula]. The partial boundary operators ∂j  =  ∂j,i:Ci(X,L)  →  Ci + 1(X,L) are defined by linearity and the formula

[formula]

for any s∈Ci(X,L). These are well defined and satisfy ∂j∂j'  =  ∂j'∂j for all j,j'. Clearly ∂2j = 0. We will denote by ∂j,I the restriction of ∂j to CI(X,L). If j∈I, then ∂j,I = 0. As in [\cite=Ser], the total boundary of s∈CI(X,L) is defined by [formula], where αI(j) is the place of j in [formula]. As usual d2 = 0. We get the spaces of cohomology with respect to ∂j and d by the usual formulas [formula] and [formula]. We can moreover break Hij(X,L) as a direct sum of subspaces HIj(X,L) with |I|  =  i defined by restricting dj to CI(X,L). When L is the trivial local system [formula], it is usually omitted from the notation.

The operators [formula] are defined by

[formula]

These operators satisfy the analogous relations [formula] and [formula]. We let [formula] denote the restriction of [formula] to [formula] for [formula]. Finally, for t∈CI(X,L) we define [formula]. Again [formula].

. Hodge Theory From now on we consider only metrized local systems. Let CI2(X,L) denote the Hilbert space completion of the space of I-cochains with coefficients in L, with respect to the pre-Hilbert norm

[formula]

We let Ci2(X,L) be the orthogonal sum of the corresponding CI's. It is clear that the operators previously defined (e.g., ∂j,i, [formula], etc.) induce bounded operators, denoted by the same letters, on the corresponding spaces C*2(X,L). In particular we have [formula] and [formula]. To see this, notice that for |I| = i and s∈CI(X,L) we have ∂j,is  =  0 if j is in I. Otherwise set [formula]. Then

[formula]

(compare [\cite=JL6]). This implies the bound [formula]. Since the CI(X,L)'s are mutually orthogonal, the same bound holds for the direct sum operator ∂j,i. The case of [formula] is similar and we omit it.

It is routine and easy to verify that [formula] is the adjoint of ∂j,I.

The laplacians [formula] are defined as usual by [formula]. On each CI(X,L) this simplifies to [formula] if j∈I and to [formula] if [formula]. These are commuting bounded self-adjoint nonnegative operators. The Laplacian [formula] is defined by

[formula]

The restriction of [formula] ([formula]) to CI(X,L) will be denoted by [formula] ([formula]). All these are also bounded, self-adjoint, and nonnegative. By definition, the space of [formula]-harmonic forms for [formula] or I, [formula], is [formula]. We likewise set [formula]. We now have the following routine

Let X be a finite regular cubical complex, and let L be a metrized local system on X. Then

[formula] and [formula]. Moreover [formula] if j∉I and [formula] if j∈I.

We have orthogonal sum decompositions (the Hodge Decomposition )

[formula]

The spectrum of the laplacian

Our main interest will be in the eigenvalues of the [formula]'s. First, we have the following

For every subset [formula] the I-cochains CI(X,L) are preserved by [formula] for all j, with i  =  |I|. Moreover, for [formula] the maps ∂j and [formula] induce isomorphisms between the λ-eigenspace of [formula] on CI(X,L) and on [formula] for any λ  ≠  0.

It follows that the study of the nonzero eigenvalues and eigenspaces of [formula] on any CI(X,L) can be reduced to the case [formula]. In fact, it is also possible to reduce the study of the full diagram

[formula]

to the case when X is an rj-regular graph and I is empty. To do this, we make for convenience the following hypothesis.

[formula]

Under hypothesis PAR we define, for any [formula], a graph [formula] and a (metrized) local system L  =  Lj,I(X) as follows. The vertices of [formula] are the cubes of type I of X; its (oriented) edges are the (oriented) cubes of type [formula], (with the I part of the orientation all 0's). For an I-cube σ of X define Lj,I(X)(σ)  =  L(vσ), where vσ is the bottom-most vertex of σ. The transition maps are then those induced from L. The compatibilities of the corresponding operators ∂j, [formula], [formula] with [formula], [formula], and [formula] are obvious from the definitions. In any mention of these graphs hypothesis PAR will be assumed.

Let [formula] be a a locally finite graph and L be a local system on [formula]. The star operator [formula] is defined to be the map sending a cochain [formula] to the cochain [formula] given by

[formula]

In case the graph [formula] we shall call [formula] the jth star operator and put [formula]. The operator Sj,I then acts on the space [formula] and accordingly Sj,i acts on the space Ci(X,L). Clearly the norm of Sj,I is bounded by rj. Since [formula] can be viewed as rj  -  Sj,I (compare [\cite=JL6]), we get the following

The norm of [formula] restricted to CI(X,L) is bounded by 2rj and its spectrum is contained in

[formula]

As a corollary, the same bound is valid for the norm of [formula] (use the orthogonal decomposition of Ci(X,L) to the CI(X,L)'s, treating separately the cases j∈I and [formula]).

In dimension 1, the classical result of Alon and Boppana (see, e.g., [\cite=Lub]) shows that the nontrivial eigenvalues of the star operator for the trivial local system are essentially bounded in terms of the norm of the star operator on the universal covering regular tree (see also [\cite=Kes] or [\cite=Bu]). This result is the following:

Let [formula] be a family of finite r-regular connected graphs whose number of vertices goes to ∞   with n. Let [formula] denote the space of zero-sum [formula] zero cochains. Then

[formula]

In the higher dimensional case set [formula] or I, and define for [formula]

[formula]

Here L is any metrized local system on X. Put also

[formula]

In particular, [formula] lies in the interval

[formula]

Ramanujan local systems arising from quaternion algebras

Let F be a totally real field of degree d over [formula] with ring of integers OF. Let ∞  i, [formula], be the infinite places of F. For an algebraic group [formula] over F we let HF be the F-rational points of [formula], let HÅ be the adelic points of [formula], and let [formula] denote the finite-adelic points of [formula]. For any finite set of finite places [formula] of F let [formula] denote the finite-adelic points of [formula] without the [formula] component.

Let B be a totally definite quaternion algebra over F with reduced norm [formula]. (A general reference for quaternion algebras over totally real fields is [\cite=Vig].) Let [formula] be the algebraic group over F associated with the multiplicative group B×. Let qv denote the cardinality of the residue field of the completion Fv of F at a nonarchimedean place v.

With [formula] denoting the Hamilton quaternions, let [formula] denote the kth symmetric power of the 2-dimensional representation of [formula] obtained by identifying [formula] with [formula]. We have [formula]. The irreducible representations of G∞ are then [formula], with [formula] and [formula], the si being any complex numbers. We denote by [formula] the space on which [formula] acts. They can be unitarized if and only if the center of G∞ acts through a unitary character, and this happens if and only if 2si  +  ki is imaginary for each i. In this event there is a G∞-invariant positive definite hermitian inner product on [formula] which is unique up to a scalar. In what follows we shall also assume that [formula]. Then an element [formula] in the center of G∞ acts via [formula]. In particular, an element x of the center F× of GF  ⊂  G∞ acts via [formula] if all the ki's have the same parity k.

Let [formula] be the center of [formula], viewed as an algebraic group over F. Let vj, [formula], be distinct nonarchimedean places of F where B is unramified, and fix identifications

[formula]

Set [formula], [formula], and [formula]. We view the vertices of the (rj = qvj + 1-regular) tree [formula] of Gj as [formula], and set [formula]. For a compact open subgroup K0 of [formula] set [formula]. Then Γ divided by its center acts discretely on [formula], and if K0 is sufficiently small the action is free. We can therefore use the notation and results of the previous section. Recall that the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture asserts that the eigenvalues of the Hecke operator Tvj are bounded by [formula] on the automorphic forms on [formula] which are unramified at vj. We now have the following

The cubical complex [formula] is irreducible, and the graph [formula] is connected for any [formula].

Suppose that every element in Γ which fixes a point on [formula] acts trivially on [formula]. Then the formula [formula] defines a local system on [formula], which is metrized, irreducible, and nontrivial unless all the kj are 0.

The cohomology groups [formula] vanish except in dimensions 0 and g.

When L defines a local system on X, it is Ramanujan provided the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture holds for holomorphic automorphic forms on [formula] of weight [formula].

1. We need only special cases of the holomorphic Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture. Let B / F; [formula]; K0; and [formula] be as above. To prove that [formula] is a Ramanujan local system on X only requires that the eigenvalues of [formula] on those automorphic forms on [formula] which are lifts of [formula]-isotypical forms on [formula] with [formula] satisfy the Ramanujan-Petersson bound. These are the automorphic forms on [formula], of level dividing K0, of ∞  -type as indicated, and of central character in [formula] which are moreover square integrable at all places where B ramifies. However, the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture seems not to be known in this generality.

2. Fortunately, when B is ramified at some finite place v (which always happens if

[formula]

As a result, we get the following

In the notation of Theorem [\ref=Ram] assume in addition that B is ramified in at least one finite place, and that all the ki's are of the same parity. Then [formula] is Ramanujan on X.

Explicit arithmetic examples

Let pfjj be g powers of rational primes pj, not necessarily distinct, and put rj  =  pfjj  +  1. Our results suffice to give the following

There exist infinitely many irreducible Ramanujan local systems over infinitely many irreducible [formula]-regular complexes.

In certain cases the construction takes a particularly simple form, in which, among other things, the [formula]'s are all Cayley graphs on the same group. (The general case is not much worse -- see [\cite=JL6] for the prototypical examples.) Namely, let us assume there is an ideal N0  ≠  0 of OF, prime to the vj's (we allow N0  =  OF), such that the following holds: We then have the following two propositions:

1. For each 1  ≤  j  ≤  g there are exactly rj (principal ) ideals Pj,i, 1  ≤  i  ≤  rj, of M whose norm to F is the prime ideal vj. This ideal has a totally positive generator, say πj, which is [formula]. We can next choose generators [formula] for Pj,i whose norm is πj, whose image [formula] under the main involution [formula] of B is some ϖj,i' for some 1  ≤  i'  ≤  rj (i'  =  i may happen ).

2. For every permutation σ of [formula] and any sequence of indices [formula], with 1  ≤  ij  ≤  rj, there is a (unique ) sequence [formula], with 1  ≤  i'j  ≤  rj, and a (unique ) unit u∈O×F, satisfying [formula], so that

[formula]

To formulate the second proposition we need to set some notation first. For a subset J of [formula] we will denote by [formula] the product [formula] where the g's are elements in any semigroup and the ji's are the elements of J in increasing order.

Let N1 be a prime ideal of OF prime to the vj's and to N0, and set N  =  N0N1. Let A be the subgroup of (OF / N1)× generated by the images modulo N1 of the πj's. Let B be the subgroup of scalars in (M / N1M)× generated by the images modulo N1M of the πj's and by those units of OF which are congruent to 1 modulo N0. Let B' be the subgroup of scalars in (M / N1M)× generated the images modulo N1M of the πj's and by those units of OF which are congruent to 1 modulo N0 and whose norm to [formula] is positive (namely 1). The groups [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic to the groups [formula], [formula], or PGL2(OF / N1). The latter case occurs if and only if at least one of the πj's is a square modulo N1. Moreover, H is a quotient of H', and the kernel subgroup has order 1 if - 1 is in the subgroup of [formula] generated by the norms [formula], and has order 2 otherwise. If the kernel is 1 assume that the parity of the ki's is even. For x∈M×S let [formula] and [formula] denote its respective reductions into H and H'. These make sense because MS / N0MS is isomorphic to M / N0M. Choose a section s:H  →  H'. With this notation we have the following

1. The vertices of X(N) are the elements of H.

2. The (oriented ) cubes of direction [formula] of X(N) are the pairs (v,I), where [formula] and I is a |J|-tuple (ij)j∈J, with 1  ≤  ij  ≤  rj.

3. For [formula], the jth bottom of the J-cube (v,I) is the J'-cube [formula], where J'  =  J - {  j  }, and I'  =  (i'k)k∈J' is the |J'|  =  (|J| - 1)-tuple characterized by

[formula]

with u a unit u∈O×F as in Proposition [\ref=generators](2).

With the same notation, invj(v,I) is the J-cube [formula], with I'' characterized by

[formula]

for an appropriate u'∈O×F.

4. The fiber of L over each v∈H is [formula]. To describe the transition maps, let e be an edge of direction {j}, say e  =  (v,i)( = (v,{  i  })), with 1  ≤  i  ≤  rj. Then botje  =  v and [formula]. Set ε  =  1 if [formula] and ε  =   - 1 otherwise. Then L(e):L(botje)  →  L(topje) is given by

[formula]

The girth of a cubical complex is the length, namely the number of edges, of the shortest homotopically nontrivial closed path. Set q  =   max jpfjj and [formula]. We now have the following generalization of [\cite=Lub]

Assume that the group H of X(N) is [formula]. Then the girth of X(N) is at least 2 log q(N2 / 4d). Put differently,

[formula]
