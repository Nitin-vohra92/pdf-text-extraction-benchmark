On Alternate Derivation of Type IIB Matrix Model

Ichiro Oda Edogawa University, 474 Komaki, Nagareyama City, Chiba 270-0198, JAPAN

Matrix models provide us non-perturbative formulations of M theory [\cite=BFSS] and type IIB superstring theory [\cite=IKKT] [\cite=FKKT] [\cite=Aoki] [\cite=Iso] [\cite=Yoneya]. It is quite surprising that such simple supersymmetric quantum mechanics theories seem to contain within them a complicated structure of supergravity.

Despite much remarkable success of matrix models, we are still far from having a complete understanding of several important problems. In particular, one big mystery is the problem of background independence [\cite=Witten]. The actions of the matrix models [\cite=BFSS] [\cite=IKKT] include a flat metric in the kinetic and/or the potential parts, which is not allowed as stressed in a previous article [\cite=Oda1]. This is because matrix models, which describe quantum gravity, should pick up its own space-time background in a dynamical manner and should not be [formula] formulated in a specific fixed background. Thus it is desirable to construct a matrix model which is independent of background metric [\cite=Oda2], but its relation to quantum gravity is not clear at present. Another interesting approach would be construction of a matrix model in an arbitrary curved background. (But we believe that the background is not completely arbitrary in that the backgorund fields would have to satisfy the proper on-shell constraints of supergravity in order that the action is κ-symmetric.)

Recently, in an attempt of constructing a type IIB matrix model on AdS5  ×  S5 [\cite=Oda3], we have utilized the Killing spinor gauge developed in [\cite=Kallosh] [\cite=Tseytlin] as the gauge-fixing condition of the κ-symmetry. (See also related works [\cite=Oda4] [\cite=Mario] [\cite=Kimura].) The aim of the present article is just to apply the method developed there to the case of a flat background geometry. Indeed, following the method we will obtain the same matrix model as found by Ishibashi et al [\cite=IKKT]. One advantage of our construction is that we do not have to make use of an analytic continuation of spinor variable in the path integral as used by Ishibashi et al. Instead, we will use the Killing spinor gauge and the world-sheet duality symmetry of type IIB superstring theory. Another advantage is of course that our construction is extensible to construction of more complicated matrix models [\cite=Oda3].

First of all, let us start with the type IIB Green-Schwarz superstring action in a flat background in the Nambu-Goto form [\cite=GS]:

[formula]

where

[formula]

with

[formula]

Here θI are Majorana-Weyl spinors in ten dimensions and various indices take the following values: i,j,... = 0,1; a,b,... = 0,1,...,9; I,J,... = 1,2.

It is straightforward to check that this action has the N = 2 supersymmetry [\cite=IKKT]

[formula]

and the local κ-symmetry

[formula]

where

[formula]

Now let us fix the κ-symmetry in the Killing spinor gauge [\cite=Kallosh] [\cite=Tseytlin]. The flat Minkowskian space-time has the Poincare group ISO(1,9) as the isometry group, so it is natural to consider the following Killing spinor gauge condition for the case at hand

[formula]

where the projection operator PIJ± is defined as

[formula]

with the chiral matrix Γ11  =  Γ0Γ1...Γ9. (The other simple choice of the projection operator is [formula]. It is easy to see that this choice leads to the same result as that shown in this paper.) Note that this projection operator satisfies the following identities:

[formula]

As a result, we can show

[formula]

where we have defined θ1+  =  θ. The latter equation in Eq.([\ref=10]), together with Eq.([\ref=2]), leads to the fact that the Wess-Zumino term L2 vanishes in the present gauge condition. Thus, we arrive at the κ-symmetry gauge-fixed action given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

The κ-symmetry gauge-fixed action ([\ref=11]) is still quartic with respect to the fermionic variable, but it is possible to reduce it to a much simpler quadratic form by making the world-sheet duality transformation as follows [\cite=Tseytlin]. To this aim, let us first rewrite the action ([\ref=11]) into the Polyakov form

[formula]

Next, we rewrite the action ([\ref=11-3]) into the first-order form by introducing the Lagrange multiplier Pai

[formula]

Actually the integration over Pai gives rise to the action ([\ref=11-3]). After integrating out Xa and then solving the resulting equation in terms of the dual variable a as

[formula]

we can obtain the desired dual action

[formula]

It is quite remarkable that the κ-symmetry gauge-fixed action ([\ref=11]) is transformed to a much simpler quadratic form through the world-sheet duality transformation.

The action S̃ is still invariant under the residual N = 2 supersymmetry. This supersymmetry can be found by amalgamating the original supersymmetry ([\ref=4]) with the κ-symmetry ([\ref=5]) to preserve the gauge fixing condition ([\ref=7]), in other words, θ1  =  iΓ11θ2. Following a similar procedure to the reference [\cite=IKKT], let us consider the mixed transformation of the N = 2 supersymmetry ([\ref=4]) and the κ-symmetry ([\ref=5])

[formula]

Provided that we define 2  =  iΓ11ε2 and 2  =  iΓ11κ2 and then choose

[formula]

the gauge fixing condition is preserved as desired. With these conditions and the definition

[formula]

it is easy to derive the new N = 2 supersymmetry law of θ whose result is given by

[formula]

whereas it is necessary to make some work to do the transformation law of [formula]. In a similar way to the case of θ, we can find the new N = 2 supersymmetry transformation law of the original variable Xa

[formula]

which gives us the transformation of Pai

[formula]

From this expression, we can derive the the new N = 2 supersymmetry law of [formula]

[formula]

Note that to derive this equation we have used the fact that gijΓ̃ can be replaced with [formula] in δPai since both the expressions make the same contribution in the action S̃. At this stage, it is important to notice that Γ̃ can be expressed in terms of the dual variable as

[formula]

Finally, integrating out gij, we finish with the dual action

[formula]

The N = 2 supersymmetry of this action is then given by

[formula]

In the above equations, we have written a simply as Xa and defined σab as

[formula]

These expressions are equivalent to those in [\cite=IKKT], so we can obtain the same type IIB matrix model by following the same path of thought as in [\cite=IKKT]. Notice that even if we have derived the same matrix model by starting with the same type IIB superstring action ([\ref=1]), ([\ref=2]) the derivation method is different. In particular, our approach does not rely on an analytic continuation of the spinor variable in the path integral which plays an important role in [\cite=IKKT] and seems to be extensible to more general situation [\cite=Oda3]. Of course, the key idea behind the approach at hand is a symmetry of the Green-Schwarz superstring action [\cite=GS] under the world-sheet duality transformation. Incidentally, we have recently examined the duality transformations of the Green-Schwarz superstring as well as supersymmetric D-brane actions in a general type II supergravity background [\cite=Oda5].
