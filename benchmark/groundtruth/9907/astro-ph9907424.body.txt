X 1908+075: An X-ray Binary with a 4.4 day Period

Introduction

X-ray surveys have consistently indicated the existence of a moderately bright X-ray source near the galactic longitude 41.97[formula] and latitude [formula]. This source, which we refer to as X 1908+075, was cataloged as 4U 1909+07 by Uhuru, the first earth-orbiting mission dedicated to celestial X-ray astronomy (Forman et al. 1978). Subsequent determinations were cataloged as 1M 1912+077 with MIT/OSO 7 (Markert et al. 1979), 3A 1907+074 with Ariel 5 (Warwick et al. 1981; Bell Burnell & Chiappetti 1984), 1H 1907+074 with HEAO A-1/LASS (Wood et al. 1984), GPS 1908+075 with EXOSAT/ME (Warwick et al. 1988). There are large uncertainties in the position determinations of these survey instruments, as shown in Fig. [\ref=pos]. The HEAO A-2 experiment on HEAO-1 scanned this region and detected X-ray emission of ~  13 mCrab in the 1.5-20 keV band (HEASARC archival data). The source was also detected with the modulation collimator experiment (HEAO A-3) on HEAO-1, with an 8σ detection in each of the two collimators for the energy range of 3-13 keV (HEASARC archival data). The HEAO A-3 instrument yields a multiplicity of relatively precise error regions which appear as a grid of diamonds in Fig [\ref=pos].

The Einstein imaging proportional counter (IPC) imaged a portion of this region and detected a source, 1E 1908.4+0730, the brightest source in the center of the field, at a significance level of ~  7σ (HEASARC archival data). The IPC flux is about 0.3 mCrab (0.5-3.5 keV), possibly highly attenuated by interstellar absorption (see table 1). The position (J2000) is α = 19h10m46s and [formula] with a positional accuracy of 50''. This position overlaps one of the HEAO A-3 "diamonds". There are a few other 5-σ detections at the edge of the field of view ([formula] square) of the IPC, and these sources are located well beyond the celestial map provided in Fig. [\ref=pos]. Furthermore, none of these sources have positions that are consistent with the HEAO A-3 diamonds. It is thus highly likely that the Einstein/IPC detection represents the same source as the X-ray survey detections. No optical counterpart has been identified within the error circle of 1E 1908.4+0730.

The X-ray spectra and flux available from the hard X-ray survey detections are roughly consistent with each other as summarized in table 1. The fluxes are about 5 mCrab in the 2-6 keV band and 7-14 mCrab in the 2-20 keV band. The spectrum of EXOSAT/ME observation of 4U 1909+07 in the 1-15 keV band (at the UHURU position) indicates excessive absorption at photon energy below 6 keV compared with that of the Crab Nebula (HEASARC archival data). The observations from the Ariel 5 spectrometer show that 3A 1907+074 has a hard spectrum which can be fitted with a power law of photon index 1.6  ±  0.15, hydrogen column density of 3+ 1.5- 1.2  ×  1022 cm- 2, and an iron line emission with equivalent width 660  ±  220 eV (Bell Burnell & Chiappetti 1984). None of these pointed observations were long enough to investigate the long-term variability of this source.

In this paper, we use the data from the All Sky Monitor (ASM) (Levine et al. 1996) on board RXTE (Bradt, Rothschild, & Swank 1993) to confirm the position and to study the nature of X 1908+075. We show that the coded mask patterns for the ASM, processed for the Einstein/IPC position, yield a persistent ~  8 mCrab X-ray source with a coherent 4.4-day periodicity for over 3 years. We then discuss the implications of this discovery.

Observation

The RXTE/ASM has been monitoring the sky routinely since 1996 February. It consists of three Scanning Shadow Cameras, each consisting of a coded mask and a position-sensitive proportional counter. The ASM is well-suited for our purpose since each of its cameras has a 1.5-12 keV response, an intrinsic angular resolution of a few arc minutes, and a large field of view of [formula](FWHM). In addition, the ASM provides observations with relatively good sensitivity (≤  5-10 mCrab in a day), frequent data sampling (~  5-30 times a day) and long baseline (thus far 3 years).

For a 90-s exposure in each ASM camera, a set of source intensities for the known sources in the FOV is derived from a χ2 fit for the overlapping shadow patterns of the X-ray sources and the X-ray background. The intensity is computed in each of the three energy bands (1.5-3, 3-5 and 5-12 keV) and the results are normalized in units of the count rate for a source at the center of the field of view of camera # 1. In these units, the 1.5-12 keV flux for the Crab Nebula is 75.5 ASM ct/s. The estimated errors of the source intensities include the uncertainties due to counting statistics and a systematic error of 1.9% determined empirically from the light curves of the Crab Nebula. A detailed description of the ASM and the light curves can be found in Levine et al. (1996) and Levine (1998).

Analysis and Results

The X-ray light curve from the ASM observations of X 1908+075 (1996 March to 1999 January) is shown in Fig. [\ref=ltc_all]. The intensity points are 5.0-d average of the intensities derived from the individual 90-s dwells for the assumed position of the Einstein/IPC source. It is apparent that X 1908+075 has generally persisted at an intensity level of about 0.6 ct/s, or 8.0 mCrab in the 1.5-12 keV band for about three years. The spatial response function of the ASM implies that these photons arise within 12 arcmin of the Einstein/IPC source position, thus confirming its association with X 1908+075. The average X-ray intensity of X 1908+075 is well below the detection threshold (30 mCrab) for a single camera exposure of the ASM. The effort to determine an independent source position using ASM data alone, e.g., with the superposition of cross-correlation maps, would be limited by the appearance of systematic noise feature with amplitudes that are a substantial fraction of the average source intensity.

The average values of the hardness ratios of X 1908+075 are HR1=1.0  ±  0.2 , HR2=3.6  ±  0.3 respectively, where HR1 is defined as the ratio of the ASM count rates in the 3-5 keV band to that of the 1.5-3 keV band, and HR2 is the ratio of the count rates in the 5-12 keV band relative to the 3-5 keV band. X 1908+075 has a much harder X-ray spectrum than either the Crab Nebula (HR1=0.9, HR2=1.1) or Cyg X-1 in the low-hard state (HR1=1.0, HR2=1.5).

Periodicities of X 1908+075 were sought by means of the Lomb-Scargle periodograms of both the light curves and the derived hardness ratios. The Lomb-Scargle periodogram (Lomb 1976; Scargle 1982; Press et al. 1992) was used for the calculation instead of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) since the ASM data points are unevenly spaced in time. With this periodogram, a maximum in the power occurs at the frequency which gives the least squares fit to a sinusoidal function. The expected average power for random noise is 1.0. We oversampled the power spectrum so that the frequencies are a factor of 4 more closely spaced than 1 / T, where T is the total duration of the data used. The goal is to ensure the detection of a peak for a signal that is of marginal statistical significance and to best locate the peak. The result is shown in Fig. [\ref=power].

There is a distinct narrow peak in the power spectra at a frequency that is corresponding to 4.400 d. The width of the power peak is 0.009-d, consistent with that of a pure sinusoidal wave. The uncertainty of this period is estimated to be 0.001 d, assuming a single signal with Gaussian noise. With 3 years of source coverage, the uneven data spacing would not degrade the uncertainty to any noticeable degree (Horne & Balinuas 1986). If we assume the noise follows an exponential distribution as expected for random noise, the false-alarm probability of this detection is less than 10- 7. In addition, there is a low-frequency peak corresponding to about 180-d period. Except for these two peaks the overall power is flat with an average of about 1.06.

We have also conducted another independent periodicity search using the epoch folding technique (Leahy et al. 1983; Davies 1990). The data were folded modulo a trial period and then grouped by phases. The resulting deviation from uniform random noise can then be detected using a χ2 test. For periods between 0.01-7 days, a distinct peak indicating the maximum deviation was found around 4.400 d with <  10- 6 false alarm probability level. This is consistent with the results of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram.

The data were then folded modulo the period of the best-fit value of 4.39986 days from the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to study the intensity variations with phase (Fig. [\ref=fold]).

The most distinctive feature in the folded light curves is the nearly sinusoidal modulation of large amplitude. We fitted a sinusoidal wave plus a constant to the folded light curves. The best fit yields a 26  ±  3% amplitude of the sinusoidal wave in the 1.5-12 keV band, 51  ±  14% in the 1.5-3 keV band, 49  ±  8% in the 3-5 keV band, and 22  ±  3% in the 5-12 keV band. The best-fit epoch for the minimum flux is:

T0 = 2450440.419  ±  0.068 + n  ×  (4.400  ±  0.001 ) (JD)

The persistence and coherence of this periodic variation were tested by subdividing the ASM light curves into four consecutive 250-d intervals and then searching for periodicities. The same analyses described above were applied to each of the 250-d light curves. In the calculated power density spectra, the signals are still visible as narrow peaks near P = 4.40 d in the power density spectra even though they are no longer independently significant. The best-fit amplitudes and phases of the sinusoidal waves are roughly consistent with each other (see Table [\ref=tab2] for a summary). We thus conclude that the modulation is persistent and coherent over the 3-year time interval.

Discussion

The X-ray emission detected by the ASM has been found to arise from the immediate region of the Einstein/IPC source, to exhibit a hard spectrum and intensity similar to the historical survey detections, and to be persistent over ~  3 years. This together with the Einstein IPC and HEAO A-3 positional correspondence strongly suggest that the position of 1E 1908.4+0730 is the accurate location of the sources seen in the historical X-ray surveys.

It is natural to link the observed 4.4-day period of X 1908+075 to the orbital period of a binary. The periods of X-rays from known sources are believed to be associated with one of the following (White, Nagase, & Parmar 1995): (1) rotational periods of neutron stars in X-ray pulsars, ranging between milliseconds to hundreds of seconds; (2) orbital periods of binary systems, ranging from tens of minutes to tens of days, and possibly hundreds of days; and (3) "superorbital" orbital periods from ~  30 days to hundreds of days, which in some cases are believed to be the precession period of the accretion disk (e.g., Levine & Jernigan 1982). It is clear that the coherence and the timescale of the 4.4-day X-ray oscillation in X 1908+075 can be best interpreted as the orbital period of a binary system.

We can then picture X 1908+075 as a binary system consisting of a compact object and a mass-donor companion star. An X-ray binary with a low mass companion (LMXB) is unlikely the scenario for X 1908+075, since the known orbital periods of most LMXBs (White et al. 1995) are on the order of hours, much shorter than the detected 4.4 days. There are only a few known LMXBs having orbital periods longer than a day, among them only Cir X-1 (P  ~  16.6 d) and Her X-1 (P  ~  1.7 d, a possible LMXB) exhibit orbital modulations in X-rays. The modulation in X-rays of Cir X-1 manifests itself as periodic flares and dips likely due to a highly eccentric orbit, while Her X-1 is an eclipsing system. Such dramatic modulations are not evident in the orbital light curves of X 1908+075. On the other hand, most HMXBs have orbital periods on the orders of days. The smooth and nearly sinusoidal modulations in X 1908+075 have a lot in common with a supergiant systems such as Cyg X-1. We therefore suggest that X 1908+075 is a high mass X-ray binary (HMXB).

We further suggest that the companion star is a supergiant rather than a Be star for the following reasons. (1) The 4.4-d orbital period fits in the range favored more by supergiant systems than by Be-star systems, as the known orbital periods of the latter are much longer than 4.4 days (≥  16.7-d) (White et al. 1995). (2) The known orbital light curves of Be-star systems are all outburst-like rather than sinusoidal (e.g., EXO 2030+375), probably due to the enhanced accretion caused by the the compact object's periastron passage around the Be star. (3) The orbital modulation of a supergiant system are known to be persistent while this is generally not true in Be-star systems (e.g., 4U 0115+63 in ASM light curves during 1996 March to 1998 November).

The smooth and roughly sinusoidal orbital modulation in the X-rays of X 1908+075 suggests that the system could be embedded in a strong stellar wind from the companion star (e.g., a supergiant O or B star), which absorbs and scatters the X-rays. The X-ray modulation is then caused by changes in the optical depth along the line of sight to the X-ray source as a function of orbital phase. For X 1908+075, absorption of X-rays probably dominates over scattering, as the amplitude of the modulation in the 1.5-5 keV band is larger than in the 5-12 keV band. To explain a modulation with an amplitude of nearly ~  22% in the 5-12 keV band, the difference in the hydrogen column densities between phases 0 and 0.5 is expected to be more than 1023 cm- 2 for an absorption and scattering process. The mechanism of the orbital modulation of X 1908+075 could be very similar to that of Cyg X-1, wherein hard state orbital modulation in the ASM light curves can be well explained with absorption and scattering in a stellar wind (Wen et al. 1999). Another example of such a system could be the newly discovered X-ray pulsar XTE  J1855-026 (Corbet et al. 1999). In this system, the orbital period is proposed to be 6.1-d as detected by the ASM. The modulation is roughly sinusoidal with an amplitude about 22% in the 1.5-12 keV band. It has also been proposed as a supergiant wind accretion system.

The hydrogen column density nH can be used to estimate the optical extinction in the V band using the empirical relation between the nH and the color excess EB - V (Savage & Mathis 1979). It is found that AV = 15 for nH = 3  ×  1022 cm- 2, as indicated from the Ariel 5 observation of 3A 1907+074. The optical objects within the Einstein/IPC error circle have magnitudes V  ≥  19 in the Palomar sky survey. To estimate the distance to X 1908+075, we first investigated the possible range of the absolute V-band magnitudes MV (from Lang 1992) known for supergiant stars in binaries with known orbital periods. We found that MV  ≤   - 5.2. Together with AV = 15 and V  ≥  19, we obtained 0.7 kpc as the lower-limit for the distance. The X-ray luminosity, estimated from the ASM count rate (1.5-12 keV), is then L1.5 - 100keV  ≥  5  ×  1034 erg s- 1 if we assume the Ariel 5 spectrum. Given the AV value, a more likely scenario is a distance ~   7 kpc estimated from the formula provided by Allen (1973), where the relation between the extinction of the star light near the galactic plane and the distance is estimated based on the average properties of interstellar absorbing clouds and the grains between them. We obtained similar distance by comparing directly the nH value of X 1908+075 with that of another galactic plane source GRS 1915+105, which is [formula] away from X 1908+075 and is believed to have a kinetic distance of 12.5 kpc and nH  =  5  ×  1022 cm2 (Chaty et al. 1996). At the distance of 7 kpc, the estimated X-ray luminosity of X 1908+075 is L1.5 - 100keV  ~  5  ×  1036 erg s- 1.

Finally, the detected 180-d period seems to be caused by scattered solar X-ray contamination. We found from the ASM light curve that three major flares happened at the times when the sun was near the field of view of this source, while flares with smaller amplitudes are evident when the sun is [formula] away from the source position. The latter may be caused by the back-scattering of the solar X-rays off the earth's atmosphere and the instrument.

Conclusions

A persistent hard X-ray emission (~  8 mCrab at 1.5-12 keV) of X 1908+075 has been detected with the RXTE/ASM at the Einstein/IPC position of ra = 19h10m46s,   [formula] (J2000) for a 3-year period. A 4.4-d period has been dicovered from the ASM light curves. The modulation is nearly sinusoidal, persistent and coherent for 3 years. The amplitude of the best-fit sinusoidal wave is 26  ±  3% in the 1.5-12 keV band. Our results support the simple interpretation that X 1908+075 is the same source as 4U 1909+07, 3A 1907+074, 1H 1907+074, GPS 1908+075, 1E 1908.4+0730, as well as the source detected by HEAO A-3. We argue that the 4.4-d period is the orbital period of a high mass binary system. We also suggest that this system consists of a compact object and a supergiant star that produces a strong stellar wind. The X-ray modulation is then caused by changes in the optical depth along the line of sight to the X-ray source as a function of orbital phase.
