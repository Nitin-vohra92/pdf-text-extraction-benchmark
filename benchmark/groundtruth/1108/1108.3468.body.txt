Re-weighing the evidence for a light Higgs boson in dileptonic W-boson decays

The LHC has effectively put an upper bound on the mass of the Standard Model Higgs boson of around 140 GeV. The low mass region that remains is favoured by electroweak precision tests and theoretical bias (given the existing lower bound of 114 GeV coming from LEP), but is the most difficult to probe at the LHC, involving challenging final states with low signal cross section and large backgrounds. One final state that is relevant right now comes from Higgs decays to W bosons, which in turn decay leptonically, [formula]. Here we propose a new observable to improve the discrimination between signal from background in this channel.

To motivate the discussion, let us first consider the transverse mass observable [\cite=vanNeerven:1982mz], originally used in the discovery of the W-boson [\cite=Arnison:1983rp]. One way to define the transverse mass is as the observable that gives the greatest lower bound on the mass of the W-boson, given the constraints that follow from conservation of energy-momentum and from the assumption that particles are on-shell [\cite=Barr:2009jv]. The utility of this definition, which seems rather cumbersome for something as simple as W-boson decays, is that it allows a generalization to any decay process involving missing energy, once one makes a hypothesis for the decay topology. The resulting variable is the natural variable for that topology, in the sense that it encodes all of the information available from kinematic considerations alone. It results in a distribution in which signal events pile up below the mass of the parent resonance, facilitating both discovery of that resonance and measurement of its mass.

In [\cite=Barr:2009mx] (see also [\cite=Barger:1987re] [\cite=Glover:1988fn]), this logic was used to define a new observable for measuring the mass of a Higgs boson that decays with significant branching fraction to a pair of charged leptons (which we refer to henceforth as simply leptons) and a pair of neutrinos. The resulting variable has a simple algebraic form, given by

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are the transverse momentum and invariant mass of the lepton pair and [formula] is the measured missing transverse momentum in the event. It was shown in [\cite=Barr:2009mx] that this variable gave an improvement over other variables, both for discovery and mass measurement. The variable was subsequently adopted by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, who found a further advantage in the form of a reduced correlation with other variables used for discriminating signal and backgrounds [\cite=ATLAS:2011aa].

Though the variable defined in [\cite=Barr:2009mx] uses all the kinematic information in the final state, there remains the possibility that advances can be made using the internal kinematic structure of the Higgs decay. Indeed, one or both of the W-bosons produced by the Higgs decay will be almost on-shell [\cite=Djouadi:2005gi], at least for a Higgs mass in the region where there is significant branching fraction to WW( * ). We will demonstrate that [\eqref=eq:truedef] is not, therefore, the optimal observable.

Similar ideas were recently applied in [\cite=Barr:2011he] to the decay of a light Higgs into ττ. In that case, both of the τ mesons will be on-shell in the interesting region of Higgs masses, and it was shown that the variable, [formula], that takes this into account in its definition significantly outperforms the variable [formula] defined in Ref. [\cite=Barr:2009mx].

Let us then reconsider the decay h  →  WW( * ) and the dominant background - continuum WW production. We define a new variable, , defined to give the greatest lower bound on the mass of the Higgs, subject to the assumption that one or other of the two W-bosons is produced on-shell. Explicitly, denoting the 4-momenta of the charged leptons and neutrinos by pμ1,2 and qμ1,2, respectively, we minimize (pμ1  +  pμ2  +  qμ1  +  qμ2)2 subject to the constraints that either (pμ1  +  qμ1)2  =  m2W or (pμ2  +  qμ2)2  =  m2W, and [formula].

It is a simple matter to show that [formula] in the limit that mW  →  0, so that there is no advantage to be gained in using [formula] in place of [formula] if mh (or [formula] for background events) is large compared to mW. (Proof: Assignments of the unknown neutrinos' momenta that yield a value of [formula] for the invariant mass of the WW system correspond to (i) vanishing invariant mass of the di-neutrino system and (ii) vanishing relative rapidity between the di-lepton and di-neutrino systems. One of these assignments also yields (iii) vanishing invariant mass for one lepton-neutrino pair and thus satisfies the extra constraint that defines [formula] in the limit mW = 0. To wit, (i) and (iii) may be satisfied trivially by assigning vanishing three-momentum to one of the neutrinos; the three-momentum of the other neutrino is then fixed uniquely by the measured [formula], which fixes the transverse components, and by (ii), which fixes the longitudinal component.) Away from the limit of small mW, and in particular for mh  <  2mW, the extra constraint requiring one of the W-bosons to be on-shell implies that [formula]. Moreover, since [formula] for signal events, we might hope for an increased number of signal events, relative to background, in a region below mh, increasing our ability to discriminate between the background-only and signal-plus-background hypotheses in an analysis based on counting events in such a region.

We now compare the performance of the two variables [formula] and [formula], using a simulation of LHC events corresponding to 10  of integrated luminosity. We use the HERWIG 6.505 [\cite=Corcella:2002jc] [\cite=Marchesini:1991ch] Monte Carlo generator, with LHC beam conditions ([formula]). Our version of the generator includes the fix to the h  →  WW( * ) spin correlations described in [\cite=herwig-bug-fix].

We generate unweighted events for Standard Model Higgs boson production (gg  →  h) and for the dominant background, q  →  WW. The detector resolution is simulated by smearing the magnitude of the missing momentum vector with a Gaussian resolution function of width [formula] where Σ is the sum of the [formula] of all visible fiducial particles.

Selection cuts are applied based on [\cite=Aad:2009wy] [\cite=ATLAS-CONF-2011-111], requiring:

Exactly two leptons [formula] with [formula] GeV and |η| < 2.5

Missing transverse momentum, [formula] GeV

[formula]

No jet with [formula] GeV

Z  →  ττ rejection: the event was rejected if [formula] and 0 < xi < 1 for both i∈{1,2}

Relative azimuth [formula]

Transverse momentum of the W pair system, [formula] GeV

The appropriate transverse mass ( or ) must satisfy 0.75  ×  mh  <  mT  <  mh.

The value chosen for [formula] is either 1.3 or 1.8, where we use the value for which the larger discovery potential is expected.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:1] we show sample distributions of the variables [formula] and [formula] for both the signal (for various mh) and WW background before any cuts are applied. As expected, the signal distributions for both variables are bounded above by mh (the upper endpoint of the distribution in the absence of resolution and finite width effects). The W mass-shell constraint means that, by construction, is larger than mW. The effect of the additional constraint is that both signal and background events having [formula] must migrate to values larger than mW, while events with [formula] significantly larger than mW are little changed (i.e. have [formula]), in accordance with the arguments given above. We also show, for comparison, the distribution of the variable [formula]. This need not be bounded above by mh if the assumption that both W-bosons are on-shell is invalid.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:2] we compare the Higgs discovery potential, as a function of mh, using only [formula] (dotted, shaded) or [formula] (solid, unshaded), as measured by the difference in log likelihood between models with or without a Higgs boson. In this figure we see the key result of this note: the Higgs boson discovery potential is improved in the region mh < 2mW and is unchanged elsewhere. This gives a strong indication that [formula] is to be preferred to [formula] for Higgs discovery purposes. This improvement may, of course, be mitigated by an increased correlation of the new variable with other variables used in the analysis; we leave this for further investigation. However, we remark that our cuts were not optimised for . Optimisation for might lead to improvements in discovery potential for mh < 2mW which are greater than those we have shown already. As expected, for Higgs boson masses above 2mW we have [formula], and so both variables are equally successful there. This begs the question: "Are there better ways of searching for Higgs bosons in this mass range?" For these larger masses one might be prepared to make the hypothesis that both W-bosons are produced on shell, in which case one could employ the variable [formula] proposed in [\cite=Barr:2011he]. Further simulations [\cite=Barr:2011si] suggest that using this variable does lead to an improvement over [formula] and [formula] for mh > 2mW so it may be possible to gain improved sensitivity for both large and small Higgs boson masses.
