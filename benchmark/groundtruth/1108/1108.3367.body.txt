Introduction

Many valued mathematical constants and elementary or special functions have continued fraction expansions. For example, the following continued fraction (CF, in short)

[formula]

is very useful expansion of the well-known inverse trigonometric function. If, however, x  ≈  1, then it converges very slowly and application of some methods of convergence acceleration is required (see [\cite=Perron]). If x  ≠  1, then CF [\eqref=E:one] can be transformed equivalently into limit 1-periodic CF of loxodromic type, and one can use the improvement machine -- the method established by Lorentzen and Waadeland (see [\cite=Lorentzen95], [\cite=Lorentzen08]). But if x = 1, then [\eqref=E:one] is of elliptic type and, according to [\cite=Lorentzen95], one can use its even part and transform it to the CF of parabolic type, of the form [formula], where [formula]. Since [formula], one can use modified approximants Sn( - 1 / 2) -- the fixed point method -- in order to accelerate the convergence of [formula] (see [\cite=Lorentzen08]). However, if [formula], then such a method usually does not succeed. One can verify that CF [\eqref=E:one] can be effectively computed using the method introduced in [\cite=Nowak06], where the convergence acceleration of [formula] was proposed;  mCkl means the class of CFs of the form [formula] with an and bn being polynomials in n (deg an = k, deg bn = l). In this paper, we extend this result to the class Dkl of so-called two-variant CFs (see [\cite=Paszkowski03]) of the form

[formula]

where an,an' and bn,bn' are polynomials in n, such that deg an  =   deg an' = k, deg bn  =   deg bn' = l. One can find a lot of examples of such CFs in the Perron's book [\cite=Perron]. More CF expansions can be found in (chronological order): [\cite=Wall48], [\cite=Lorentzen08] and [\cite=Cuyt08]. The authors of [\cite=Cuyt08] have developed the website which shows the applications of continued fractions to approximation of many special functions (see ).

For example, the following CF expansion holds

[formula]

where [formula] is the Jacobi elliptic function, very often applied in electro- and magnetostatics, fluid dynamics, as well as nonlinear integrable equations (see [\cite=Perron] or [\cite=Lorentzen08]). Although the equation [\eqref=E:cn] is known for almost 100 years (the first edition of Perron's book [\cite=Perron] was issued in 1913), current computer algebra systems do not use it. For instance, the Maple system is not able to compute the integral in equation [\eqref=E:cn] with x  =  0.8 and k  =  0.9; if we replace the upper limit ∞   by 500, then the correct result is obtained after 1.5 minutes of waiting. Thus, the problems which require computing a lot of such integrals are almost insolvable using the current mathematical software like Maple or Mathematica. The motivation for using aforementioned techniques of convergence acceleration is, among others, the fact that CF expansion [\eqref=E:cn] allows us to compute such integrals in a split of a second.

Our main result is a new method for convergence acceleration of two-variant CFs. Below, we give some notation used in this paper. In Section [\ref=s:main], we describe the class D of considered CFs (see [\eqref=D]). We analyse tails of CFs and try to find out their asymptotic form. Our investigations require to study many cases of CFs' subclasses. For the sake of clarity, we moved some technical results to [\ref=apa]. We show that derivation of the coefficients of asymptotic expansion of tails is quite costly. Thus, we propose an iterative method that improves the accuracy of tails' approximations. In Section [\ref=s:method], we describe our method in detail. The main result is in Theorem [\ref=T:convacc]. Next, in Section [\ref=s:alg] we use this result repeatedly in order to obtain the algorithm, which is of iterative character, producing tail approximations whose asymptotic expansion's accuracy is improved in each step. This idea is summarized in the Algorithm [\ref=alg]. Finally, in Section [\ref=s:num], we report the results of experiments involving some CFs belonging to the class D.

Some notation

Let Sn(ω) denote the n-th modified approximant of CF [\eqref=etvcfrac]; see [\cite=Lorentzen92] or [\cite=Lorentzen08] for more details. Clearly, we have

[formula]

We use the symbol f(n) to denote the n-th tail, i.e.,

[formula]

Asymptotics of tails

Our method for convergence acceleration is based on the obvious fact: if CF is convergent to V, then all its tails are also convergent, and

[formula]

Since Sn(ω) is the linear fractional transformation in ω, it is of great importance to find the best approximation ωn of the tail f(n). Then the modified approximant Sn(ωn) may be a very good approximation of V.

In Subsection [\ref=s:class], we describe the class D of considered CFs. Taking into account their 'two-variant' character (cf. [\eqref=etvcfrac]), we deal with odd tails only,

[formula]

One can verify that tails un of CF [\eqref=etvcfrac] satisfy the following recurrence relation:

[formula]

In Subsection [\ref=astail], we analyse the behaviour of tails un and state their asymptotic expansion (see [\eqref=eunexp]). Also, we give formulae for its leading coefficients (see Theorem [\ref=tmu]). Let us remark that derivation of them requires considering all the subclasses in D, separately. Thus, we move part of calculations to [\ref=apa].

Class D

We consider some subclasses of CFs of the form [\eqref=etvcfrac], where We say that CF [\eqref=etvcfrac] is of class Dkl if pk,pk',ql,ql' are leading coefficients in the above expansions. In this paper, we consider only k∈{1,2} and l∈{0,1}, since any CF of class Dk + 2,l + 1 is equivalent to some of the class Dkl.

Let us fix some notation related to CFs' subclasses considered here. In this paper, we consider the CFs belonging to

[formula]

see Table [\ref=Tab:Rozwazane_podklasy], where the characterization of all the subclasses is given.

Asymptotic expansion of tails

It follows from [\eqref=urec] that tails un satisfy the equation (see also [\cite=Paszkowski03]):

[formula]

Now, we analyse the asymptotic behaviour of its solutions. Observe that recurrence relation [\eqref=oddtailsrel] is bilinear and all its coefficients have the asymptotic expansion in powers of n- 1 (cf. [\eqref=easab]). Therefore, its solutions have the asymptotic expansion in powers f n- 1 / 2. Moreover, this expansion is at most O(n2):

[formula]

More precisely, equation [\eqref=oddtailsrel] has two solutions Xn',Xn'' of the form [\eqref=eXnexp]. According to Paszkowski [\cite=Paszkowski03], the sequence un is a solution Xn∈{Xn',Xn''}, such that {Xnan + 1  /  (bn + 1  +  Xn + 1)} is asymptotically smaller in modulus. It means that the problem in solving the equation [\eqref=oddtailsrel] reduces to choosing suitable coefficients τj, such that

[formula]

Of course, knowing the coefficients τj, we can give good approximations of the tails un, and good approximations of CF value, as well (cf. [\eqref=ematail]). In this Subsection, we give formulae for some portion of the coefficients [formula], in the case of any subclass in D, named in Subsection [\ref=s:class].

First, we put the value μ  ≤  4 (cf. [\eqref=eXnexp] and [\eqref=eunexp]). From [\eqref=easab], it follows easily that μ  ≤  2 if [formula]. In the sequel, we allow to be τ-  μ = 0. We will show that this may happen only in the case of D≠10 or D11. Therefore, we call τ-  μ the beginning coefficient (not the leading one) of expansion [\eqref=eunexp]. According to Lemma [\ref=ld1020], we choose and assume that τ-  ν = 0 if ν  >  μ. The proof of Lemma [\ref=ld1020] is rather technical and requires considering all the subclasses in D separately.

Second, let us look at the beginning coefficient τ-  μ. Our main results are as follows. Lemma [\ref=lmueq] shows that τ-  μ satisfies quadratic equation ατ2  +  βτ  +  γ = 0, while Theorem [\ref=tmu] specifies which root it is, where α, β and γ are given in Table [\ref=tab:alpha]. Also, we give there simple formulae for τ-  μ; in Lemmata [\ref=ld1020], [\ref=ld20] one can find the formulae for the next coefficients of the expansion [\eqref=eunexp].

The beginning coefficient τ-  μ is given explicitly in the following way.

In the case of D=10 (μ = 1):

[formula]

In the case of D≠10 (μ = 2):

In the case of D11 (μ = 2):

[formula]

In the case of D=20 (μ = 2):

[formula]

where α,β and γ are given in Table [\ref=tab:alpha];

In the case of D≠20 (μ = 4):

In the case of [formula] (μ = 2): we choose τ- 2 as the first of the roots {x0,x1} of equation [\eqref=etaueq] if

[formula]

According to Paszkowski [\cite=Paszkowski03], the sequence of odd tails f(2n - 1) of CF [\eqref=etvcfrac] is such a solution of recurrence equation [\eqref=oddtailsrel], for which the product f(2n - 1)f(2n) is asymptotically smaller in modulus.

Before we start, let us observe that setting

[formula]

yields, after some simple calculations that use only Lemmata [\ref=ld1020] and [\ref=lmueq]:

In the case of D=10:

[formula]

In the case of D≠10:

[formula]

In the case of D11:

[formula]

In the case of D=20:

[formula]

In the case of D≠20:

[formula]

In the case of [formula]

[formula]

Let us observe that the last formula is well-defined. Otherwise, assuming τ- 2 =  - q- 1 and using [\eqref=E:D21:m=-6], we derive p- 2q- 1 = 0, which is a contradiction. The formulae [\eqref=E:Dn10:iloczyn], [\eqref=E:D11:iloczyn] and [\eqref=E:Dn20:iloczyn] easily imply the parts 2, 3 and 5 of the thesis. To complete the proof of the parts 1 and 4, it is enough to make use of the two obvious facts. First, if [formula] for any κ  >  λ  >  ν, then

[formula]

Second, [formula] holds for any [formula] [formula]. In order to complete the proof of the part 6, let us observe that inequality [\eqref=E:D21:tau_-2] is equivalent to

[formula]

By multiplying both sides by |p -  2  q -  1  /  q -  1'|, we obtain

[formula]

Now, let us note that [formula] (equal to the quotient γ  /  α in the case [formula]; see Table [\ref=tab:alpha]). Hence, we have [formula] and thus

[formula]

Therefore, the choice [formula] implies that In has asymptotically smaller absolute value (cf. [\eqref=E:D21:iloczyn]).

Method

In this Section, we present the method for convergence acceleration. We consider only CFs of subclasses in D, given in [\eqref=D]. However, in general, our idea can be applied to any CF whose sequence of odd (or even) tails un has asymptotic expansion of the form [\eqref=eunexp]. Then the only problem is to derive the initial approximations of the tails un.

The main objective is to improve, in each step, the accuracy of approximations of tails un. Of course, one can use the technique of Subsection [\ref=astail] to obtain a suitable number of coefficients τj in the expansion [\eqref=eunexp]. This approach was discovered more than half-century ago by Wynn in [\cite=Wynn59]; see also [\cite=Lorentzen08]. Let us note that in such a case, each coefficient τj can be expressed in terms of all the previous coefficients τj - 1, τj - 2, , τ-  μ, and hence the computation of them explicitly is quite costly. For example, in the case of CF[formula], the recurrence formula for the sequence of tails of CF was given in [\cite=Nowak06].

Our goal is to obtain better and better approximations of the tails [\eqref=eunexp] without computing the coefficients τj explicitly. We will construct approximations u(m)n of tails un, such that u(m)n are of increasing accuracy, for consecutive values of m, in the sense that:

[formula]

More precisely, if u(m)n - un  =  O(n -  m  /  2), then u(m + 1)n - un  =  O(n -  m  /  2  -  θ), where θ > 0 is given in [\eqref=theta]. Our method is of the iterative character, since we express u(m + 1)n in terms of u(m)n and u(m)n + 1. Similar concept was given by Lorentzen and Waadeland, and called 'improvement machine' (see [\cite=Lorentzen08] or [\cite=Lorentzen95], for more details). However, their method cannot be applied to all the subclasses in D and, as numerical examples show, is less efficient than ours.

The following technique is very similar to the one presented in [\cite=Nowak06], but is more subtle, since we deal with more subclasses of CFs and consider only their odd tails, whose asymptotic expansion can have powers of n- 1 / 2. However, from Lemmata [\ref=ld1020] and [\ref=ld20], it follows that tails un mostly have expansion in n- 1. Only in the case of D=10 the expansion [\eqref=eunexp] may contain powers of n- 1 / 2. Numerical examples show that it is hard to accelerate such a class of CFs.

[formula]

where m  ≥  0 is an integer number and c  ≠  0 is an unknown constant. Here, the name computable means that we can compute them for consecutive values of [formula]. The formula [\eqref=E:delta_prim] says that asymptotic expansions on un and un' are identical up to the term n- (m - 1) / 2, and so we say that un' has the order m / 2. Since the approximations un' are different from un, they do not satisfy the equation [\eqref=oddtailsrel]. Thus, let us define new approximations,

[formula]

(cf. [\eqref=urec]), and observe that they are computable, too. They do not give better results than the approximations un', because one can check that modified approximants S2n - 1(u+n), S2n + 1(un + 1') are equal. Nevertheless, we can do a trick, using both of them in order to obtain new approximations un'' of higher order. The main results are summarized in Theorem [\ref=T:convacc], and the details are in its proof. The trick is the same as in [\cite=Nowak06]. Roughly speaking, we want to find a relationship between δn' and

[formula]

It can be easily verified that δ+n may be expressed by δn + 1' as follows

[formula]

where

[formula]

However, the formula [\eqref=E:delta_n^+] is useless, since ψn is expressed in terms of the tails un + 1, which are unknown and rather incomputable. The major concept is to transform δn + 1' into δn' in the relation [\eqref=E:delta_n^+] and put un + 1' instead of un + 1 in [\eqref=E:psi_n]. This is done in order to obtain the relationship of the form

[formula]

for some computable functions φn', ψn' and ζ > 0. Then the new approximations un'' can be found a solution of [\eqref=relation], provided that the right-hand side of [\eqref=relation] is replaced by zero and un (stemmed from δn' and δ+n) by un''. Clearly, we express un'' in terms of un', u+n, φn', ψn' and obtain

[formula]

Let the approximations un' of tails un satisfy [\eqref=E:delta_prim] with m such that

[formula]

Let u+n be given by [\eqref=E:u_n^+], and let auxiliary functions ψn', φn' be given by

[formula]

Then the approximations un'' defined by

[formula]

satisfy

[formula]

where

[formula]

Roughly speaking, the idea of the proof is to modify the relation [\eqref=E:delta_n^+] in order to obtain relation [\eqref=relation].

First, we use the following formula relating δn + 1' and δn':

[formula]

This can be verified by substituting n + 1 in place of n in [\eqref=E:delta_prim] and using simple algebra. Observe that number ξ is common for all classes in D except the class D=10; it follows from Lemmata [\ref=ld1020] and [\ref=ld20]. In the case of D=10 the formula [\eqref=deltan+1] is exactly the same as the one given in [\cite=Nowak06].

Second, let us observe some properties of function ψn'. One can check that

[formula]

This is not obvious only in the case of [formula]. Clearly, the coefficient of n4 in the denominator of ψn' is then equal to p- 2  +  q- 1'  q- 1  +  q- 1'  τ- 2 and it does not vanish, because of the choice of τ- 2, given in Theorem [\ref=tmu]. Next, using the definition [\eqref=E:psi_n] yields

[formula]

and thus Now, using the fact that [formula] (cf. [\eqref=E:m:zalozenie]) and multiplying equation [\eqref=E:delta_n^+] by φn' (some simple algebra is needed) yields the relation [\eqref=relation] for [formula]. Further, let us observe that approximations un'', given in [\eqref=E:u_n''], can be found as a solution of the following equation, derived from [\eqref=relation] by replacing right-hand side by zero and un (stemmed by δn' and δ+n) by un'':

[formula]

Observe that equation [\eqref=ab] follows immediately by subtracting [\eqref=relation] from the above formula. To complete the proof, let us state the following result:

[formula]

Hence, the formulae [\eqref=delta''] and [\eqref=theta] hold. Observe that it is important that [formula] in [\eqref=E:epsilon_n], since we need to divide the equation [\eqref=ab] by φn' - ψn'.

To verify the formula [\eqref=E:epsilon_n], let us determine the beginning coefficients, say σj, of the asymptotic expansion of φn' - ψn':

[formula]

By Lemmata [\ref=ld1020] and [\ref=ld20], we know that the coefficients σ2j + 1 [formula] may be nonzero only in the case of D=10. The proof is based on the following facts:

in the case of D=10:  [formula]

in the case of D≠10:  [formula]

in the case of D11:  [formula]

in the case of D=20:  [formula] (cf. [\eqref=E:j/2:nierownosc:1]);

in the case of D≠20:  [formula]

in the case of [formula]:  [formula]

Only the last one needs some explanation. Namely, let us put

[formula]

One can verify that

[formula]

where [formula] is discriminant of the quadratic equation given in Lemma [\ref=lmueq]. In the case of subclass [formula], we have obviously [formula] (see Table [\ref=Tab:Rozwazane_podklasy]). Suppose that σ0 = 0. Using the following simple algebra:

[formula]

yields z = 0, and thus [formula]. This implies that p- 2  p- 2' = 0, which is a contradiction.

Algorithm

Now, we summarize all the previous results. We give here the algorithm for convergence acceleration of CFs of the class D (see [\eqref=D]). It is almost fully rational in the sense that it makes only arithmetical operations. Only in the case of CFs of subclass D=10 the initial calculations need to compute square roots. In the main loop of the algorithm, only arithmetical operations are used, for all the subclasses in D.

The algorithm is divided into two parts. First, we calculate initial approximations un0 of tails un of CF, such that un0 - un  =  O(n- m / 2), where (cf. [\eqref=E:m:zalozenie]). There we use the results given in Section [\ref=astail]. The second and main part of algorithm is the iteration which improves, in each step, the accuracy of approximations unj of the tails un. Clearly, using the Theorem [\ref=tmu] repeatedly, we obtain the following relation for approximants unj:

[formula]

Numerical results

We give examples of some remarkable mathematical constants and special functions having continued fraction expansions. We apply our method (see Algorithm [\ref=alg]) in order to approximate their value.

Consider a two-variant CF of the form [\eqref=etvcfrac] belonging to the class D. Of course, one may always approximate its value using the following classic methods:

computing classical approximants Sn(0) for sufficiently large n,

applying the methods given in [\cite=Lorentzen95] or [\cite=Nowak06] to even or odd part of CF,

using equivalent transformation in order to obtain limit 2-periodic CF, and using the techniques given in [\cite=Lorentzen95],

using the recent methods of Paszkowski [\cite=Paszkowski03].

See [\cite=Lorentzen08] for more details on numerical computation of CFs. The first idea should be rather the last resort in order to compute any CF. Convergence of CF from the class D may be very slow (see Example [\ref=ex1]).

The second method requires to derive even or odd part of CF (see, e.g., [\cite=Lorentzen08]). After that, in order to apply the techniques summarized by Lorentzen in [\cite=Lorentzen95], some equivalent transformation (see, e.g., [\cite=Lorentzen08]) into limit periodic CF may be needed. However, for some subclasses in D, this process leads to the case that the methods given in [\cite=Lorentzen95] or [\cite=Nowak06] are not applicable. For example, the 'improvement machine', mentioned in Section [\ref=s:method], can be applied only to CFs of the so-called loxodromic type; see, e.g., [\cite=Lorentzen95] for definition of CFs of loxodromic, elliptic, parabolic and identity type. Clearly, one can verify that odd (even) part of CF of the subclasses D=10,D=20 is equivalent to a limit periodic CF of parabolic type. Then the question of its convergence acceleration is much more subtle unless it is divergent. In the case of limit periodic continued fraction [formula] of parabolic type, one can always try to use so-called fixed point method (see [\cite=Lorentzen95], [\cite=Lorentzen08]), i.e. computing modified approximants Sn( - 1 / 2), provided that, without loss of generality, cn  →   - 1 / 4 and dn  →  1. But, in order to accelerate its convergence, there are some additional conditions required (see, e.g., [\cite=Lorentzen95]). In examples [\ref=ex2] and [\ref=ex3] we show a class of CFs (belonging to D=20 and D=10) having odd (even) part of parabolic type, for which 'fixed point' method does not work.

The third method is quite similar to the previous one, since it depends on the type of limit periodic CF. Still the 'improvement machine' can be applied only in the case of CF of loxodromic type. Other cases need more careful handling. Anyway, all mentioned methods of computing limit periodic CFs do not cover the considered class D of CFs.

The fourth method, established by Paszkowski [\cite=Paszkowski03], is based on analytical transformation of tails of CF. It can also be applied only to some subclasses in D. For example, it does not handle the case of CF with tails having the asymptotic expansion in powers of n- 1 / 2, and so it cannot be applied to the subclass D=10. Moreover, it is quite difficult to compare such analytical method with Algorithm [\ref=alg], which is rather of numerical character.

In the sequel, we give a series of examples showing the application of our method (Algorithm [\ref=alg]) in order to accelerate the convergence of CFs belonging to the class D. We give additional remarks on computing their value by using aforementioned methods, and, if it is possible, we show a comparison.

Before we begin, let us fix some notation to measure the accuracy of the method. Consider the CF [formula] of the class D, convergent to the value V. Let [formula] denote number of exact significant decimal digits of x in V:

[formula]

We use the following notation: where unj are the values computed by Algorithm [\ref=alg]. Let us remark that unj is an approximation of the tail un = f(2n - 1) of CF, and that is why we analyse the modified approximant S2n - 1(unj) (cf. [\eqref=ematail]). We call the number [formula] accuracy of unj. In all numerical examples, we observed that it is increasing in j, unless it reaches the peak level, which can be, in some cases, more or less the half of the arithmetic precision in a given computer algebra system. We used the system Maple 14 with 128-digit (decimal) arithmetic precision.

Consider the following CF expansion

[formula]

([formula], cf. [\cite=Perron]), where ψ(x) denotes the digamma function, ψ(x)  =  Γ'(x) / Γ(x). Let us put [formula] and [formula]. We have the following CF of subclass D=20:

[formula]

It is very slowly convergent. For example, the 100th classical approximant [formula] yields δ100 = 2.25. One can check that δ1000 = 3.24 and δ10000 = 4.24, so it seems that accuracy of classical approximants is increasing logarithmically. Nevertheless, one can derive very good approximation of its value by using modified approximants Sn(ωn) with ωn  ≈  f(n). The Algorithm [\ref=alg] provides the approximations unj of tails f(2n - 1) of increasing accuracy in j, in the sense that

[formula]

where τi are the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion of the tails un = f(2n - 1) (see [\eqref=eunexp]). Let us observe that in each step of iteration in Algorithm [\ref=alg], we derive only one (nontrivial) coefficient of this expansion; let us remark that τ2i - 1 vanishes for all [formula]. This is the worst case to accelerate (cf. [\eqref=theta]). However, the approximation u1,10 yields about ten decimal digits of value V of fraction [\eqref=E:33] [\eqref=12:1:1/2]:

[formula]

Table [\ref=tab:33] [\ref=12_1_1/2] shows the accuracies of all approximations unj needed to be computed in order to obtain the value u1,10. One can observe that accuracy of u1,j (see the second row of the table) is increasing linearly in j. Moreover, it is worth to analyse the Figure [\ref=fig:ulamek_33] [\ref=12_zbieznosc_w_kolejnych_iteracjach_metody], since it shows the values δnj -- accuracies of unj -- for large values of n. One can observe that each step of iteration in Algorithm [\ref=alg] is of great importance, since it is much more productive than using approximations unj for large values of n, provided that j is fixed. On the other hand, one can verify that even part of CF [\eqref=E:33] [\eqref=12] is equivalent to the CF of the form [formula], where

[formula]

and so it is of parabolic type. Thus, we cannot use 'improvement machine' of Lorentzen and Waadeland (see [\cite=Lorentzen95], [\cite=Lorentzen08]). Let us remark that [formula], so CF is convergent by some generalisation of Worpitzky's theorem (see [\cite=Wall48], [\cite=Lorentzen08]). Moreover, we get [formula], since we took x = 1. Using the theorem of Thron and Waadeland [\cite=ThronWaadeland80], we show that modified approximants Sn( - 1 / 2) are convergent to the value V faster than classical approximants Sn(0), and so the 'fixed point' method works. However, it is not very efficient, since the accuracy of Sn( - 1 / 2) behaves similarly to δn0 for consecutive values of n. Namely, for n = 10,100,1000,10000, we get the following values of [formula]: 4.52,6.36,8.35,10.34, respectively. In order to obtain 14 decimal digits of V we have to compute S670000( - 1 / 2). This should be compared with δ1,13 = 14.0 obtained after only 13 iterations in Algorithm [\ref=alg].

Let us now set [formula], [formula] in [\eqref=E:33] [\eqref=12]. We obtain CF with value [formula] and even part being equivalent to CF of the form [formula], where

[formula]

It is of parabolic type, too, hence we cannot use 'improvement machine' of Lorentzen and Waadeland. One can verify that conditions given by Thron and Waadeland in [\cite=ThronWaadeland80] are not satisfied, and we cannot use their results to accelerate the convergence, either. Indeed, 'fixed point' method fails -- it gives only about 0.5 accuracy more than classical approximants Sn(0). For example, we have [formula]; [formula]; [formula]; [formula]. On the other hand, one can effectively approximate the value V of the considered CF using Algorithm [\ref=alg]. The accuracies δ1j for [formula] are:

[formula]

One can verify that CF in [\eqref=E:33] [\eqref=12] is equivalent to a the fraction considered by Paszkowski [\cite=Paszkowski03]. Namely, we have

[formula]

where class M is defined in [\cite=Paszkowski03]. Using Paszkowski's analytical formulae gives a faster convergent CF. For example, its classical approximant 20 yields [formula], while our method (applied to [\eqref=E:33] [\eqref=12]) -- δ1,20 = 20.0.

Now, let us consider the following CF of subclass D=10:

[formula]

(cf. [\cite=Perron]). The asymptotic expansion of its tails contains powers of n- 1 / 2 (see Theorem [\ref=tmu]), and thus we cannot use Paszkowski's method [\cite=Paszkowski03] in order to accelerate its convergence. Using its even part, we derive the following one-variant CF of subclass C21:

[formula]

Unfortunately, we cannot use the method of [\cite=Nowak06], since the above fraction does not belong to the subclass I1  ⊂  C21 (see the notation introduced in [\cite=Nowak06]). Further, the equivalent transformation into limit periodic CF of the form [formula] gives

[formula]

Let us put [formula] and [formula]. Then CF in [\eqref=E:103] [\eqref=14] is convergent to

[formula]

We have δ10 = 0.61, δ50 = 3.02, δ100 = 4.45 which shows quite slow convergence of the fraction. Applying 'fixed point' method to CF [formula] equivalent to [\eqref=E:103] [\eqref=14:C21] seems to be worthless, since: Indeed, equation [\eqref=E:103] [\eqref=14] [\eqref=par] [\eqref=z] does not follow the assumptions of Thron and Waadeland [\cite=ThronWaadeland80]. Let us remark that the computations of Algorithm [\ref=alg] is organized so that array unj is upper triangular. Thus, if we want to compute the approximation u1,r, then we need to start with r + 1 initial approximations un0 [formula]. Applying our method to [\eqref=E:103] [\eqref=14] yields u1,79 with accuracy δ1,79 = 26.23. Let us note that Sn(0) for [formula] yield at most 6 exact significant decimal digits of V.

Now, let us consider CF of subclass [formula]:

[formula]

(cf. [\cite=Perron]). We use its even part and obtain the CF of subclass C21, of the form [formula] with

[formula]

One can easily check that it is of loxodromic type and belongs to subclass I1 (see notation in [\cite=Nowak06]). Thus, one can use either 'improvement machine' or the method described in [\cite=Nowak06]. Of course, one can also use 'fixed point' method, classical approximants of CF, as well. We try to compare their results with the results obtained by Algorithm [\ref=alg] applied to CF [\eqref=E:152] [\eqref=7].

Let us put complex value of parameter [formula]. Notice that it is very close to the ray ( -   ∞  , - 1], which is the divergence region of [\eqref=E:152] [\eqref=7]. Hence, CF [\eqref=E:152] [\eqref=7] is convergent very slowly. Indeed, we have

[formula]

We applied 'improvement machine' and the method described in [\cite=Nowak06] to CF [formula] (cf. [\eqref=E:D21:cd]), and the Algorithm [\ref=alg] to CF [\eqref=E:152] [\eqref=7]. All of the methods construct upper triangular array of tails' approximations. We provide all of them with only fifteen initial approximations. Table [\ref=tab:152] [\ref=7:complex] presents the obtained accuracies. One can observe that 'improvement machine' yields only 4 decimal digits, while method of [\cite=Nowak06] and Algorithm [\ref=alg] -- 10 and 16 exact significant decimal digits of V, respectively.

Computing coefficients of asymptotic expansion of tails

Here we show some formulae for coefficients τj of the expansion [\eqref=eunexp] of tails un for all considered subclasses of continued fractions (see Table [\ref=Tab:Rozwazane_podklasy]). All the proofs will basically follow the idea given by Wynn in [\cite=Wynn59]. More precisely, we put the expansions [\eqref=easab] and [\eqref=eunexp] into the recurrence relation [\eqref=oddtailsrel] in order to obtain the coefficients τj. After some rearrangement of terms, this leads to the following equation:

[formula]

where ωj are coefficients of the expansion of [formula] One can check that

[formula]

where [formula] means generalised Newton's symbol

[formula]

Let cm denote the coefficients of powers of n- m / 2 in [\eqref=E:u_n_rec_expansion] ([formula]); the first few of them are as follows: Equating them to zero gives the infinite system of equations satisfied by the unknown coefficients τj:

[formula]

Taking into account the forms of numerators an and denominators bn (see [\eqref=easab]), there easily follows that μ  ≤  2 if CF[formula]. Hence, the first few equations of [\eqref=E:uklad] are obviously satisfied. In Lemma [\ref=ld1020] we analyse this in the case of all considered subclasses of CFs. In Lemma [\ref=lmueq], we show the form of quadratic equation satisfied by the beginning coefficient τμ.

The following formulae hold:

For [formula]:

[formula]

In the case of D≠10:

For [formula]:

For [formula]:

[formula]

Each part of the lemma has to be considered separately. For the subclass D10, the equations [\eqref=E:uklad] for [formula] are trivially satisfied. For m =  - 4, we obtain that

[formula]

so there must be τ- 2 = 0 in the case of D=10. Then the equation of [\eqref=E:uklad] with m =  - 3 is evidently satisfied, and those corresponding to m =  - 2, - 1 can be simplified to the form: The latter equation yields the result of the part 1.

Using similar analysis, one can prove the part 4. Namely, in the case of class D20, the equations [\eqref=E:uklad] with m =  - 10 and m =  - 9 are obviously satisfied. However, equations corresponding to m =  - 8 and m =  - 7 can be written in the form

[formula]

Hence, τ- 4 = 0 in the case of D=20. Then equation [\eqref=E:D20:m=-7] is trivially satisfied, and the next equation of [\eqref=E:uklad], related to m =  - 6, can be written as

[formula]

This proves the result of the part 4.

The proofs of the remaining parts have a lot in common, so that we show only the proof of the part 2. Equation of [\eqref=E:uklad], related to m =  - 3, can be simplified to the form

[formula]

Comparing this with [\eqref=E:D10:m=-4] implies that τ- 1 = 0, regardless of whether τ- 2 = 0 or not. Formula for τ0 follows from the equation of the system [\eqref=E:uklad] with m =  - 2. Next, using induction on j  ≥  0, one verifies that the equation of [\eqref=E:uklad], related to m = 2j - 3, can be simplified to the form

[formula]

Hence, all the coefficients [formula] vanish.

The beginning coefficient τ-  μ of expansion [\eqref=eunexp] satisfies the quadratic equation

[formula]

where α,β,γ are given in Table [\ref=tab:alpha].

The proof uses Lemma [\ref=ld1020] and the arguments in its proof. In the cases D≠10 and D=10 the coefficients α,β,γ result from [\eqref=E:D10:m=-4] and [\eqref=E:De10:m=-2], respectively. Considering the subclass D11, the equation [\eqref=E:uklad] for m =  - 10, - 9, - 8, - 7 (cf. [\eqref=E:m=-10]-[\eqref=E:m=-7]) holds trivially, while for m =  - 6 can be written in the form In the case of subclass D=20, using Lemma [\ref=ld1020], we have that the equation of [\eqref=E:uklad] with m =  - 5 is trivially satisfied. The next equation, related to m =  - 4, is of the form

[formula]

In the case of D≠20, the coefficients α,β,γ easily result from [\eqref=E:D20:m=-8]. Finally, in the case of [formula], the equations of the system [\eqref=E:uklad] related to m =  - 10, - 9, - 8, - 7 (cf. [\eqref=E:m=-10]-[\eqref=E:m=-7]) are obviously satisfied, and the one corresponding to m =  - 6 can be written in the form

[formula]

The Lemma [\ref=ld20] extends the results given in the part 4 of Lemma [\ref=ld1020], for the subclass D=20. Notice that Lemma [\ref=ld20] follows by application of Theorem [\ref=tmu] which is proved using Lemma [\ref=ld1020].

In the case of D=20, we have

We continue the strategy of the previous proof. The equations of the system [\eqref=E:uklad] corresponding to m =  - 3 and m =  - 2 simplify to respectively. The latter equation yields the formula for τ0. One can check that the coefficient of τm in the equation of the system [\eqref=E:uklad] related to m >  - 2 is given by

[formula]

Moreover, using the induction on [formula], one may verify that the equation of [\eqref=E:uklad], corresponding to m = 2j - 1, can be simplified to the form To complete the proof, we show that expression [\eqref=e:coeff] cannot vanish for any integer m >  - 2. Namely, suppose that

[formula]

for some [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

Let us denote

[formula]

where α,β,γ are given in the Table [\ref=tab:alpha] (cf. the class D=20). From Theorem [\ref=tmu], we derive that

[formula]

(cf. [\eqref=E:De20:tau_-2]), and hence the inequality [\eqref=E:j/2:nierownosc:1] can be written in the form

[formula]

We conclude that κ is a real number satisfying [formula], which is a contradiction.
