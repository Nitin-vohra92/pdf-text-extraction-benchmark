On the nature of highly vibrationally excited states of Thiophosgene

Introducion

Understanding the nature of the highly excited molecular eigenstates is equivalent to deciphering the mechanism of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) occuring in the molecule[\cite=smalley83]. However, the assignment of eigenstates is far from simple. The existence of and interplay of several strong anharmonic resonances result in complicated spectral patterns and highly mixed states. Nevertheless, eigenstates of molecular systems rarely exhibit the extreme scenario of being completely ergodic or completely regular[\cite=bnn04]. A generic situation, even at fairly high energies, is the coexistence of several classes of eigenstates with differing degree of mixing being interspersed among each other[\cite=jajcp99] [\cite=gl08]. More interestingly, the interspersed states can show several sequences associated with certain identifiable common localization characteristics. In other words, although a full set of quantum numbers do not exist for labeling such states, there are reasons to believe that a sufficient number of approximate quantum numbers do exist to understand, and hence assign, the eigenstates. Since the approximate quantum numbers arise out of the local dynamics due to specific resonances, relevant at the energies of interest, the assignment is inherently dynamical in nature. In a nutshell, several decades of work have shown that dynamical assignments can be done reliably only if the structure of the corresponding classical phase space is well understood[\cite=dynassign].

This work is concerned with the dynamical assignment of the eigenstates of thiophosgene SCCl2. The Hamiltonian of interest is a highly accurate spectroscopic Hamiltonian obtained[\cite=sgjcp06] by Gruebele and Sibert via a canonical Van Vleck perturbation analysis of the experimentally derived normal mode potential surface[\cite=sgpccp04]. The Hamiltonian can be expressed as H = H0 + Vres with

[formula]

The zeroth-order anharmonic Hamiltonian is H0, whose eigenstates are the feature states and Vres accounts for the important anharmonic resonances responsible for the IVR dynamics. In the rest of the paper the various resonances will be refered to by simply indicating the modes. For instance, the first resonance term in Vres above will be refered to as the 526-resonance. The hermitian adjoints of the operators are denoted by c.c., and the operators ak, [formula], and [formula] are the lowering, raising, and number operators for the kth mode respectively with = 1, in analogy to the usual harmonic oscillator operators. Based on the possible resonances suggested by the normal mode frequencies and the observed spectral "clumps" in the dispersed fluorescence spectra, three approximately conserved quantities (known as polyads) arise which can be expressed as

[formula]

Thus, the ν4 mode is not involved in any resonant interactions with the rest of the modes. Due to the polyad constraints one has effectively a three degree of freedom system and three of the quantum numbers out of a total six needed to assign a quantum state are already known. Nevertheless, as will be seen below, even this reduced system presents a stiff challenge with regards to the dynamical assignments of the highly excited eigenstates.

The IVR dynamics in SCCl2 has been the subject of several recent experimental[\cite=sgpccp04] [\cite=cgjcp109] [\cite=rmjcp08] and theoretical[\cite=jtsjpc06] [\cite=cgjcp209] [\cite=jtjcp10] studies. In an early detailed study, Strickler and Gruebele established[\cite=sgpccp04] that the IVR state space (zeroth-order quantum number space) has an effective dimensionality of three as opposed to the theoretically possible six. Combined with the observation of regular progressions persisting upto the first dissociation energy of about 600 THz, one expects restricted IVR in the system. This in itself is surprising since the effective Hamiltonian fit, as in eq. [\ref=qham], to the stimulated emission pumping (SEP) spectra contains strong multimode Fermi resonances. In addition, the SEP spectra are quite complex and congested in the 200 - 300 THz region. However, it was noted that the regular progressions mainly involved the Franck-Condon active ν1 (C-S stretch) and the ν4 (out-of-plane bend) modes, and thus avoided the strongest resonances. Furthermore, Chowdary and Gruebele recently[\cite=cgjcp109] showed the existence of sharp SEP spectral features in the energy range of 550 - 700 THz which includes both the molecular SCCl2 →   CS +   Cl2 and the radical SCCl2 →   SCCl +   Cl dissociation channels. Although, one could rationalize the observation as due to the avoidance of the strong 526-resonance involving modes ν2 (a1 symmetry C-Cl stretch), ν5 (b2 symmetry C-Cl stretch), and ν6 (b2 symmetry Cl-C-Cl bend), a similar argument for the equally strong 156-resonance involving modes ν1 (a1 symmetry C=S stretch), ν5, and ν6 is not possible. Sibert and Gruebele performed[\cite=sgjcp06] a detailed study of the IVR dynamics using eq. [\ref=qham] and concluded that around 240 THz (~   8000 cm- 1), close to the threshold for facile IVR, zeroth-order states coexist exhibiting a broad range of dynamical behvior ranging from fairly restricted to highly facile IVR. A rather extensive study[\cite=cgjcp209] of nearly 106 zeroth-order bright ("feature") states by Chowdary and Gruebele concluded that about one in thousand feature states are localized even at the highest energy - not enough to invalidate statistical theories but certainly indicating that even near the dissociation limit SCCl2 is not just a bag-of-atoms.

The above observations hint at the existence of different classes of eigenstates in a specific energy range. For instance, even around an energy of about 590 THz one observes[\cite=cgjcp109] states whose IVR line widths vary nonmonotonically with energy. Thus, in order to gain further insights into the IVR dynamics a closer look at the eigenstates of eq. [\ref=qham] is necessary. An earlier work by Jung, Taylor, and Sibert using a second order version of eq. [\ref=qham] established[\cite=jtsjpc06] that several distinct eigenstate classes exist in the spectrally complicated region 7000 - 9000 cm- 1 (~   210 - 270 THz). More recently[\cite=jtjcp10], Jung and Taylor dynamically assigned the states and came up with a detailed semiclassical classification scheme for the eigenstates.

In this work an attempt is made to answer the following questions. Firstly, can one identify the various eigenstate classes in a manner that is not dependent on visualizing the high dimensional wavefunctions quantum mechnically or semiclassically? More importantly, such a method should be able to make contact with the relevant structures like periodic orbits and their bifurcations in the high dimensional classical phase space. Secondly, do the eigenstate classes and sequences identified previously persist when using a higher order and more accurate Hamiltonian? Finally, is there a possibility of new modes being born due to specific bifurcations in the system?

Classical limit Hamiltonian

In order to dynamically assign the eigenstates it is important to analyze the classical limit Hamiltonian corresponding to eq. [\ref=qham] and the procedure is well established in literature. The full classical Hamiltonian, in terms of the zeroth-order action-angle variables [formula], can be found in an earlier work[\cite=jtsjpc06]. Here, the reduced three degree of freedom classical Hamiltonian, taking into cognizance the polyads (K,L,M), is of interest and can be obtained via a suitable [formula] canonical transformation[\cite=jtsjpc06]. The resulting reduced Hamiltonian can be expressed as [formula] where

[formula]

is the zeroth-order Hamiltonian and the resonant perturbations (nonlinear resonances) are given by

[formula]

In the above equations the actions conjugate to the angles (ψ4,ψ5,ψ6) are (Kc = K + 3 / 2,Lc = L + 5 / 2,Mc = M + 1 / 2) i.e., the classical analogs of the quantum polyads. The transformed actions {Jk} are related to the zeroth-order quantum numbers as Jk  =  (vk + 1 / 2). The various parameters [formula] of the reduced Hamiltonian are determined in terms of the original parameters (see supplementary information in reference [\cite=sgjcp06] for the values). The relations are not shown here but note that at this order the parameters [formula] depend on the polyads K,L, and M.

Dynamical assignment

In this section two recent techniques[\cite=jtjpc07] [\cite=sejcp03], used to analyze the highly excited eigenstates, are briefly mentioned. The reader is referred to an earlier publication[\cite=mkjpc09] for the theoretical basis and validity of the methods along with a detailed comparison.

In the first approach[\cite=jtsjpc06] [\cite=jtjcp10] [\cite=jtjpc07] the quantum states |α〉 for a given (K,L,M) are expressed in the semiclassical angle space [formula] as

[formula]

with [formula] and ignoring an overall phase factor. Due to the 2π-periodicity of the angles, the semiclassical wavefunctions [formula] now "live" on the classical reduced configuration space which is a three dimensional torus T3. The nature of the states is determined by plotting the density [formula] and the phase of eq. [\ref=semirep] on select two-dimensional sections of T3.

The second approach[\cite=sejcp03] [\cite=mkjpc09] involves computing the eigenstate expectation values of the various anharmonic resonances. The expectation values are naturally related to the parametric variation of the corresponding eigenvalues, also called as the level-velocities. For example,

[formula]

Previous works[\cite=sejcp03] [\cite=skcpl04] [\cite=mkjpc09] [\cite=peres] have shown that the level-velocities, semiclassically, are extremely sensitive to the underlying structures in the classical phase space. There is also an interesting connection (not elaborated here) between the parametric variation of eigenvalues to the matrix fluctuation-dissipation theorem[\cite=gjpc96] of Gruebele. In what follows the terms expectation values and level-velocities will be used interchangeably.

Recently[\cite=mkjpc09] it was argued that a combination of the above approaches can be very powerful towards gaining key insights into the nature of the highly excited eigenstates. The current work provides further support for such an argument. To begin with, a single resonance case is analyzed in order to set the stage for looking at select eigenstates of the full system. Although the single resonance case is classically integrable, the correct assignment of the states needs to be done with care due to the multimode nature of the resonance.

Integrable multimode resonance

In the full quantum Hamiltonian, all the anharmonic resonances as shown in in eq. [\ref=qham] are turned off except for the multimode 156-resonance. Since, the quantum and classical Hamiltonians couple only the ν1,ν5, and ν6 modes, the quantum numbers (v2,v3) are good quantum numbers. Consequently, one already has five good quantum numbers (K,L,M,v2,v3) to label those quantum states that are under the influence of the said resonance. States that are not affected by the resonance are trivially assigned by the full set of zeroth-order quantum numbers and hence will not be discussed further. In the present case it is desirable to organize the states using [formula] since this represents the plane on which the states live in the original six-dimensional state space.

The geometry of the (v1,v5,v6) space is shown in Fig. [\ref=stspgeomplot] for the specific case of v3 = 0. For given (K,L,M), the space is filled with Ps-planes with v3 being fixed on each plane. On a given Ps-plane, fixed values of v2 correspond to lines determined by points (v1,K2 - v1,Ps - K2 - v1) with [formula]. An eigenstate will be delocalized only along one of the lines on the Ps-plane. Two points are to be noted at this stage. Firstly, the area of the Ps-planes decrease with increasing v3 and the length of the lines on a given plane decreases with increasing v2. Consequently, unperturbed normal modes should be expected for high excitations in the (v2,v3) modes. Secondly, the number of state space points (v1,K2 - v1,Ps - K2 - v1) on a given line determines the quantum number μ, an excitation index, related to the phase space area enclosed by the 156-resonance island in the classical phase space.

Therefore, a knowledge of the quantum number μ provides a complete assignment |K,L,M,Ps;v2,μ〉 of the single resonance eigenstates. This information can be obtained both from the semiclassical wavefunction and the level-velocity approaches mentioned above. For instance, looking at the phase of the semiclassical state in the ψ1 = 0 plane will immediately reveal the (v2,v3) quantum numbers. Similarly, keeping track of the phase advance along the ψ1 direction in the ψ3 = 0 or ψ2 = 0 plane will yield μ as the excitation quantum number[\cite=jtjcp10] [\cite=jtjpc07].

Equivalently, in Fig. [\ref=lvelint156plot](A) the quantum eigenstate expectation values of the 156-resonance operator are shown. The apparent congested nature of the figure is a direct result of the interleaving of the various state sequences with different v3. The sequences, however, can be easily identified by analyzing the corresponding classical phase space function [formula] with

[formula]

In the above expression the quantities K2c and Psc correspond to the classical analogs of the quantum K2 and Ps respectively. It can be shown that classical expectation value is large and has equal magnitudes at the resonant angles 1 = 0,π and resonant action

[formula]

The expectation values are positive for ψ1 = 0 and negative for ψ1  =  π. From the classical phase space perspective the opposite signs translate to states being localized about the stable or unstable fixed points of the resonance island. Using the classical estimate it is possible to identify the highly localized states which further spawn the sequences with different μ and in Fig. [\ref=lvelint156plot](B) some of the v2-sequences for fixed v3 = 0 i.e., Ps = 14 are shown. For instance, the sequence shown in Fig. [\ref=lvelint156plot](B) (circles) is assigned as |7,14,0,14;0,μ〉 with μ = 0 (maximum positive expectation value) to μ = 7 (maximum negative expectation value). All such sequences can be easily identified and hence a complete assignment of the integrable, single resonance cases can be provided in terms of the appropriate quantum numbers.

Including other independent resonances in eq. [\ref=qham] results in a non-integrable system with highly mixed states which are presumably interspersed with some of the regular states. For example, including the 526-resonance (and/or the 125-resonance) in addition to the 156-resonance destroys the v2 quantum number. In terms of the geometry described above, since v3 is still conserved, the Ps-planes are preserved but the states now spread over the entire plane. Further inclusion of the 231-resonance and 36-resonance destroys the Ps-planes as well and the states now spread over the entire state space. In the next two sections the goodness of v2 and v3 are broken sequentially in order to check if any new state sequences appear despite the nonintegrability of the system.

Breaking the goodness of v2

In this section only the resonances involving modes ν1,ν2,ν5, and ν6 are considered. Thus, v2 is no longer a good quantum number whereas v3 is still a good quantum number. Note that the set of resonances involved here are the strongest ones in thiophosgene and therefore strong state mixings are expected. Are there any patterns in this case? In analogy to Fig. [\ref=lvelint156plot](B), the v3 = 0 case of the nonintegrable system is shown in Fig. [\ref=lvelpsgoodplot] using the level velocity approach. Since several level velocities are compared in the figure, all of them are scaled to zero mean and unit variance.

From Fig. [\ref=lvelpsgoodplot] it is clear that eigenstate sequences do exist in this non-integrable case and a few of them are highlighted by dashed lines. It is important to note that the observed sequences are different from the v2-sequences seen in Fig. [\ref=lvelint156plot](B) since v2 is no longer a good quantum number. Three key observations are worth making at this stage. Firstly, the initial sequences starting at high energy can be identified using 〈V156〉 or equally well using 〈V526〉, two of the strongest resonances in the system. Interestingly, as evident from Fig. [\ref=lvelpsgoodplot](top inset), these sequences can also be identified from 〈V125〉 and 〈V261〉 values. The large values of 〈V261〉 despite the weakness of the 261-resonance is an example of the nontrivial nature of such multiresonant systems. The two major resonances induce a relatively strong 261-resonance in certain regions of the Ps plane, resulting in significant perturbation of the state sequences. Thus, at high energies the states are under the influence of several resonances. Secondly, at low energies the sequences are less robust (note the curvature of the dashed lines in the figure) and fewer in number, but seem to be organized more by the 526-resonance. Thirdly, the various sequences "collide" near E  ~  7800 cm- 1 leading to significant disruption of the regularity of the sequences. Small level velocities and energy spacings in this region imply several multistate avoided crossings and suggest that the state mixing could be due to dynamical tunneling[\cite=keirpc07]. Dynamical assignments of the states in this complicated transition region are difficult if not impossible.

Support for the level velocity predictions comes from computing the participation ratio NP in the various single resonance basis [formula] (eigenstates of single resonance Hamiltonians), shown in Fig. [\ref=lvelpsgoodplot](bottom inset). The number of basis states participating in a given eigenstate |α〉 is computed as

[formula]

The participation ratios indicate that, except for a few states at the high and low energy ends, most states are moderately mixed. Moreover, large values of NP at E  ~  7800 cm- 1 in every basis agrees well with the level velocity data. Note that hints for the existence of eigenstate sequences are present in the NP data, but nowhere as emphatically as reflected in the level velocity plots.

The various sequences observed here are consistent[\cite=jtjcp10] with the previous results of Jung and Taylor. This can be established by looking at appropriate slices of the semiclassical three-dimensional angle space representations of the eiegnstates. In Fig. [\ref=psgoodsemi] the semiclassical (ψ1,ψ2;ψ3 = 0) angle space representations are shown for select states in the v3 = 0 manifold. A striking correspondence can be seen between the sequences revealed by the level velocities shown in Fig. [\ref=lvelpsgoodplot] and the eigenstate density patterns as observed in the semiclassical angle space. The first column of states correspond to the sequence, indicated in Fig. [\ref=lvelpsgoodplot], starting with the highest energy state and have clear nodal structure - no nodes in the diagonal direction and increasing number of nodes in the antidiagonal direction. Similarly, states in the second column belong to the second high energy sequence indicated in Fig. [\ref=lvelpsgoodplot] and exhibit an additional node in the diagonal direction. Both these sequences correspond to the class A classification given earlier[\cite=jtjcp10] and the nodes along the diagonal and antidiagonal directions yield two additional quantum numbers td and ta respectively. For instance, the first state in column one of Fig. [\ref=psgoodsemi] is assigned as |K,L,M;v3 = 0,td = 0,ta = 0〉 and the assignment |K,L,M;0,1,2〉 is appropriate for last state in the second column.

On the other hand, the third column in Fig. [\ref=psgoodsemi] corresponds well to the sequence indicated in Fig. [\ref=lvelpsgoodplot] starting with the lowest energy state. Although the angle space densities show localization around ψ1  =  0,2π, suggesting 156-resonant states, the level velocity results show that the influence of the 526-resonance is far greater in comparison. State space plots and the participation ratio data do establish the first state of the sequence to be closer to being a 526-resonant state. However, the later states in the sequence are perturbed strongly by the induced 261 resonance (see the top inset of Fig. [\ref=lvelpsgoodplot]) and hence nontrivial to assign. The last column of Fig. [\ref=psgoodsemi] show three states that are in the complicated energy region around 7800 cm- 1. The mixed nature of these states is evident both from the angle space densities as well as the level velocity and participation ratio data. Presumably the induced 261-resonance is leading to the highly mixed states. In particular, the middle state of the last column seems to be a state that is delocalized over an extended region of the phase space and such states have been observed in a different context in an earlier study[\cite=mkjpc09].

Breaking the goodness of v3 - the full system

The previous section identified sequences of eigenstates exhibiting similar localization properties of a subsystem of the full Hamiltonian eq. [\ref=qham] wherein v3 was a good quantum number. The goodness of v3 is strictly broken in the full system, obtained from the subsystem with the inclusion of the remaining 36 and the 231 resonances. A key question is whether the sequences in Fig. [\ref=lvelpsgoodplot] would persist in the full system. The answer to this question can be obtained by analyzing Fig. [\ref=fullplot] which shows scaled 〈V156〉 and 〈V526〉 for all the 288 eigenstates. The expectation values 〈V261〉 and 〈V125〉 are also substantial, as in Fig. [\ref=lvelpsgoodplot], but not shown for the purpose of clarity. It is immediately clear from Fig. [\ref=fullplot] that the high end of the polyad does exhibit several sequences highlighted by solid and dashed lines connecting the states. Specifically, the solid line sequences correspond to increasing v3 with fixed (td,ta) quantum numbers and the dashed lines correspond to increasing td with ta = 0 and fixed v3 values. In particular, these high energy states correspond precisely to the class A states discussed in the previous section with similar semiclassical (ψ1,ψ2) angle space representations. Note that in Fig. [\ref=lvelpsgoodplot] only the v3 = 0 states are shown and including states for different values of v3 would show high energy patterns similar to those seen in Fig. [\ref=fullplot].

The robustness of the class A sequences is also confirmed in Fig. [\ref=fullplot](I) wherein the participation ratio of the high energy eigenstates is seen to be nearly unity in the v3-good basis i.e., in the eigenbasis of the subsytem discussed in the previous section. For these set of states v3 is approximately conserved and can be used to label the eigenstates. Consequently, it is possible to infer that the lowest frequency mode ν3 (a1, Cl-C-Cl bend) is decoupled from the rest of the modes in the

[formula]

cm- 1 is particularly complicated with several highly mixed states and states exhibiting transitional nature between the two extreme classes, A and C, of localized states.

Highly excited ν4 states

Up until now the focus has been exclusively on the v4 = 0 case i.e., no excitations in the out-of-plane bending mode. Experimentally, however, the ν1 and ν4 modes have dominant Franck-Condon activity[\cite=sgpccp04] and sharp assignable features in the spectra are seen[\cite=cgjcp109] even around and above the dissociation energy. Most of the sharp features have fairly large values of v4 in their assignments. Thus, it is interesting to ask if the nature of the eigenstates, in terms of localization as well as the different classes, undergo any significant change upon exciting the ν4 mode. Earlier works have hinted at a smooth morphing of the reduced dimensional wavefunctions[\cite=cgjcp109] with increasing ν4 excitation and the existence of IVR-protected zeroth-order states for large number of quanta in the ν4 mode[\cite=sgjcp06]. Can the level-velocity technique used in this work provide any insights?

As a preliminary effort, Fig. [\ref=n4bifurplot] summarizes the result of increasing ν4 excitation on the highest energy eigenstate in the polyads

[formula]

Conclusions

The central point of this work is to emphasize the fact that highly excited eigenstates of multiresonant effective Hamiltonians form several sequences, corresponding to different classes of dynamics, interspersed amongst each other in a complicated fashion. However, the tools used in this work are ideal to disentangle the sequences and gain insights into the nature of the eigenstates. A remarkable aspect that emerges from this and other previous studies is worth noting - the expectation values shown, for example, in Fig. [\ref=fullplot] are quantum objects. Nevertheless, the observed patterns and sequences in the expectation values have a one-to-one correspondence with the semiclassical angle space densities of the eigenstates. Thus, this establishes the close classical-quantum correspondence that exists for spectroscopic Hamiltonians. At the same time, the observation that state space based measures of localization or delocalization of the eigenstates are insufficient to identify the sequences suggests that phase space is the ideal setting where the true nature of the eigenstates are revealed - a conclusion that fortifies decades of earlier work[\cite=dynassign] on systems with smaller degrees of freedom. The semiclassical action-angle representation is not all that abstract afterall!

It is heartening to see that the simple level-velocity approach is capable of identifying the eigenstate sequences. The present work agrees, to a large extent, with the previous analysis[\cite=jtjcp10] and classification of the eigenstates. In particular, the eigenstate classes predicted in the earlier studies do persist in this study which uses a more accurate Hamiltonian. Therefore, the different classes of eigenstates and predictions of their influence on the IVR dynamics of certain zeroth-order bright states are expected to be robust even upon inclusion of other weak higher order resonances. The approach adopted in this work is easily generalized to systems with any number of degrees of freedom with several anharmonic resonances. The recently proposed method[\cite=mkjpc09] of lifting the eigenstates onto the Arnold web i.e., the network of nonlinear resonances can lead to further detailed insights into the anatomy of certain mixed states (cf. last column of Fig. [\ref=psgoodsemi]).

Finally, Fig. [\ref=psgoodsemi] presents another crucial question. Are there experimental signatures of the eigenstate sequences? Clearly, a state localized in the semiclassical angle space representation need not be localized in the state space representation. However, since the quantum expectation values do pick out the sequences correctly, it is of some interest to see if there are any spectral signatures of such different classes of eigenstate sequences. Alternatively, Fig. [\ref=n4bifurplot] suggests that new modes, like the counter-rotator and local bending modes in acetylene, might appear in SCCl2 due to the various bifurcations in the underlying classical phase space. Again, there must be spectral fingerprints of such new modes. More work in this direction needs to be done.
