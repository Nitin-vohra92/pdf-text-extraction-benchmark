Coefficient Estimates for Meromorphic Bi-Univalent Functions

Introduction

An analytic function defined on some open set D that maps different points of D to different points is called univalent in D and let S denote the class of univalent functions f defined on the open unit disk [formula] of the form

[formula]

The well-known Koebe one-quarter theorem asserts that the function f∈S has an inverse defined on disk [formula], [formula]. Thus, the inverse of f∈S is a univalent analytic function on the disk [formula]. The function f∈S is called bi-univalent in [formula] if f- 1 is also univalent in the whole disk [formula]. The class [formula] of bi-univalent analytic functions was introduced in 1967 by Lewin [\cite=Lewin] and he showed that, for every functions f∈ of the form [\eqref=eq1.1], the second coefficient of f satisfy the inequality |a2| < 1.51. Subsequently, Brannan and Clunie [\cite=BrannanClunie] improved Lewin's result by showing [formula]. Later, Netanyahu [\cite=Netanyahu] proved that max f∈  ~  σ ~ |a2|  =  4 / 3. Since then, several authors such as Brannan and Taha [\cite=BrannanTaha], Taha [\cite=Taha] investigated the subclasses of bi-univalent analytic functions and found estimates on the initial coefficients for functions in these subclasses. Recently, Ali et al. [\cite=Ali], Frasin and Aouf [\cite=FrasinAouf], Srivastava et al. [\cite=Srivastava] also introduced new subclasses of bi-univalent functions and found estimates on the coefficients a2 and a3 for functions in these classes.

In this paper, the concept of bi-univalency is extended to the class of meromorphic functions defined on [formula]. For this purpose, let Σ denote the class of all meromorphic univalent functions g of the form

[formula]

defined on the domain Δ. Since g∈Σ is univalent, it has an inverse g- 1 that satisfy and Furthermore, the inverse function g- 1 has a series expansion of the form

[formula]

where M < |w| <   ∞  . Analogous to the bi-univalent analytic functions, a function g∈Σ is said to be meromorphic bi-univalent if g- 1∈Σ. The class of all meromorphic bi-univalent functions is denote by ΣB.

Estimates on the coefficient of meromorphic univalent functions were investigated in the literature; for example, Schiffer [\cite=Schiffer] obtained the estimate |b2|  ≤  2 / 3 for meromorphic univalent functions g∈Σ with b0 = 0. In 1971, Duren [\cite=Duren] gave an elementary proof of the inequality |bn|  ≤  2 / (n + 1) on the coefficient of meromorphic univalent functions g∈Σ with bk = 0 for 1  ≤  k  <  n / 2. For the coefficient of the inverse of meromorphic univalent functions, Springer [\cite=Springer] proved that and conjectured that In 1977, Kubota [\cite=Kubota] has proved that the Springer conjecture is true for n = 3,4,5 and subsequently Schober [\cite=Schober] obtained a sharp bounds for the coefficients B2n - 1, 1  ≤  n  ≤  7, of the inverse of meromorphic univalent functions in Δ. Recently, Kapoor and Mishra [\cite=KapoorMishra] found the coefficient estimates for a class consisting of inverses of meromorphic starlike univalent functions of order α in [formula].

In the present investigation, certain subclasses of meromorphic bi-univalent functions are introduced and estimates for the coefficients b0 and b1 of functions in the newly introduced subclasses are obtained. These coefficients results are obtained by associating the given functions with the functions having positive real part. An analytic function p of the form [formula] is called a function with positive real part in [formula] if [formula] for all [formula]. The class of all functions with positive real part is denoted by P. The following lemma for functions with positive real part will be useful in the sequel.

[\cite=Good] The coefficient cn of a function p∈P satisfy the sharp inequality

Coefficient estimates

In this section, certain subclasses of the class ΣB of meromorphic bi-univalent functions are introduced and estimates on the coefficient b0 and b1 for functions in these subclasses are obtained.

A function g given by series expansion [\eqref=eq1.2] is a meromorphic starlike bi-univalent functions of order α, 0  ≤  α < 1, if and where the function h is the inverse of g given by [\eqref=eq1.3]. The class of all meromorphic starlike bi-univalent functions of order α is denote by Σ*B(α).

If the function g given by [\eqref=eq1.2] is a meromorphic starlike bi-univalent function of order α, 0  ≤  α < 1, then the coefficients b0 and b1 satisfy the inequalities

Let g be the meromorphic starlike bi-univalent function of order α given by [\eqref=eq1.2]. Then a calculation using Equation [\eqref=eq1.2] shows that

[formula]

Since h = g- 1 is the inverse of g whose series expansion is given by [\eqref=eq1.3], a computation shows that

[formula]

Comparing the initial coefficients, the following relations are obtained:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Equations [\eqref=eq2.1]-[\eqref=eq2.4] yield

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Use of Equations [\eqref=eq2.5]-[\eqref=eq2.8] shows that the series expansion for the function g- 1 given by [\eqref=eq1.3] becomes

[formula]

A calculation using Equation [\eqref=eq2.9] shows that

[formula]

Since g is a bi-univalent meromorphic function of order α, there exist two functions p,q with positive real part in Δ of the forms

[formula]

and

[formula]

such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Use of [\eqref=eq2.12] in [\eqref=eq2.14] shows that

[formula]

In view of the Equations [\eqref=eq2.10] and [\eqref=eq2.16], it is easy to see that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Similarly, use of [\eqref=eq2.11], [\eqref=eq2.13] in [\eqref=eq2.15] immediately yields

[formula]

and

[formula]

Equations [\eqref=eq2.17] and [\eqref=eq2.19] together yields and

[formula]

Since [formula] in Δ, the function p(1 / z)∈P and hence the coefficients cn and similarly the coefficients dn of the function q satisfy the inequality in Lemma [\ref=lemma1.2] and this immediately yields the following estimate: This readily yields the following estimate for b0: The estimate |b0|  ≤  2(1  -  α) also follows directly from [\eqref=eq2.17]. Using Equations [\eqref=eq2.18] and [\eqref=eq2.20] yields or By Lemma [\ref=lemma1.2], the estimates |c2| = |d2|  ≤  2 holds. This estimate together with the estimate of b0 imply that Therefore

The function g given by [\eqref=eq1.2] is said to belong to class [formula] of bi-univalent strongly starlike meromorphic functions of order α, 0  <  α  ≤  1, if and where the function h is the inverse of the function g given by [\eqref=eq1.3].

The class considered in Definition [\ref=def1.1] is related to starlikeness of order α and the second subclass in Definition [\ref=def1.2] is associated with strongly starlikeness of order α. It should be noted that meromorphic starlike bi-univalent functions of order 0 is essentially the same as meromorphic strongly starlike bi-univalent functions of order 1: [formula]. In view of this connection, it should be noticed that the class [formula] provides a generalization of the class of meromorphic starlike bi-univalent functions in a different direction; the class Σ*B(α) is associated with right half-planes while the class [formula] associated with sectors. It is pertinent to see that the estimates of b0 and b1 in Theorem [\ref=th1.1] when α = 0 is the same as the corresponding estimates in Theorem [\ref=theorem2.4] when α = 1.

If the function g given by [\eqref=eq1.2] is in the class [formula], 0 < α  ≤  1, then the coefficients b0 and b1 satisfy the inequalities

Consider the function [formula]. Then, by definition of the class [formula],

[formula]

where p and q are functions with positive real part in Δ and the series expansion of p and q are respectively given by and A computation yields

[formula]

and, by definition of g, This equation with Equation [\eqref=eq2.23] and first equation in [\eqref=eq2.22] yield

[formula]

and

[formula]

Similarly

[formula]

and The last equation and Equation [\eqref=eq2.26] together with the second equation in [\eqref=eq2.22] implies

[formula]

and

[formula]

Using the Equations [\eqref=eq2.24] and [\eqref=eq2.27], one gets and which implies

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lemma1.2], |c1|  ≤  2 and |d1|  ≤  2 and using them in [\eqref=eq2.29], it follows that Hence Equations [\eqref=eq2.25] and [\eqref=eq2.27] together yield

[formula]

In view of [\eqref=eq2.29], the previous equation becomes Lemma [\ref=lemma1.2] again gives the estimates |ci| = |di|  ≤  2 for i = 1,2, and using these in the above equation immediately yields

[formula]

This shows that

Meromorphic Bazilevi bi-univalent functions

This section is related to a general class called the class of meromorphic Bazilevi bi-univalent functions. Let p∈P, h∈, α any real number and β > 0, Bazilevi [\cite=Bazil] introduced a subclass of A consisting of the principal branch of the functions and he showed that each principal branch is univalent in [formula]. In the case when α = 0, a computation shows that or

[formula]

Thomas [\cite=Thomas] called a function satisfying the condition [\eqref=eq3.1] as a Bazilevi function of type β. Furthermore, if h(z) = z in [\eqref=eq3.1], then the condition [\eqref=eq3.1] becomes

[formula]

The class of all functions f∈A satisfies [\eqref=eq3.2] is introduced by Singh [\cite=Singh] and the class of all such functions is denoted by B(β). In this section, the estimates for the initial coefficients of the meromorphic functions analogous to the functions belonging to the class B(β) are obtained.

Let β > 0 and 0 < α  ≤  1. A meromorphic bi-univalent function g given by [\eqref=eq1.2] is said to be in the class ΣBB(β,α) of meromorphic strongly Bazilevi bi-univalent functions of type β and order α, if and where the function h is the inverse of g and given by [\eqref=eq1.3].

Let β > 0 and 0 < α  ≤  1. If g∈ΣBB(β,α), then the coefficients b0 and b1 satisfy the inequalities

Suppose g∈ΣBB(β,α) has a representation given by [\eqref=eq1.2], then a computation shows that

[formula]

Further calculations show that

[formula]

The assumption g∈ΣBB(β,α) shows that there is a function p with [formula] such that

[formula]

where the function p has the representation given by The Equations [\eqref=eq3.3], [\eqref=eq3.4] and [\eqref=eq2.23] together yield the following:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Similarly and Hence

[formula]

and

[formula]

The hypothesis g∈ΣBB(β,α) again implies that there exist a function q with [formula] satisfying

[formula]

where q has a series representation given by Equations [\eqref=eq3.7], [\eqref=eq3.8] and [\eqref=eq2.26] yield

[formula]

and

[formula]

Equations [\eqref=eq3.5] and [\eqref=eq3.9] shows that and or

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lemma1.2], |c1| = |d1|  ≤  2 and use of this ineqaulity in the Equation [\eqref=eq3.11] immediately leads to the following estimate for b0:

[formula]

This completes the proof of the inequality |b0|  ≤  2α / (1  -  β). Yet another calculation using [\eqref=eq3.6] and [\eqref=eq3.10] shows that Use of [\eqref=eq3.11] in the above equation leads to the following expression for b1:

[formula]

Once again, an application of Lemma [\ref=lemma1.2] immediately yields

[formula]

and therefore

If b0 = 0 for the function g∈Σ, the series expansion [\eqref=eq2.9] becomes This series expansion was obtained by Schober [\cite=Schober].

The function g(z) = z  +  1 / z is clearly a univalent meromorphic function. A direct calculation that This function shows g- 1 has the series expansion given by

If g given by [\eqref=eq1.2] is in the class Σ*B(α), 0 < α  ≤  1, and b0 = 0, then

Assume that the function [formula] where 0 < α  ≤  1. Since b0 = 0, c1  =  d1 = 0 and the result can be verified by a direct calculation of [\eqref=eq2.16].

Let [formula], where α > 0 and 0 < β  ≤  1. Then

Since the function [formula] where 0 < α  ≤  1 and b0 = 0, it follows that c1  =  d1 = 0. By replacing these values in Equation [\eqref=eq2.30] and continuing as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem2.4], the result is obtained.
