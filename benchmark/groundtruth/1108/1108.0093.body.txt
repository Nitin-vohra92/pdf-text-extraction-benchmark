INTRODUCTION

It is well established now that existence of magnetic field aligned plasma sheared flows is a fundamental reality throughout the space plasmas [\cite=Amatucci] [\cite=Ergun] [\cite=Koepke]. The presence of velocity shear produces a drastic changing in the stability properties of these plasma flows, development of specific shear flow driven instabilities and plasma turbulence, which is responsible for efficient mechanisms for ion energization. A substantial amount of research has been devoted to hydrodynamic electrostatic instability of such shear flows, which was originally discussed by D'Angelo [\cite=DA65] and named now as a D'Angelo mode. This instability is of Kelvin-Helmholtz type. It was investigated experimentally and theoretically in different conditions specifically both in collisionless [\cite=DA66] and collisional [\cite=Willig] plasmas, in a plasmas with negative ions [\cite=An] [\cite=DA91] as well as in dusty plasmas [\cite=DA90] [\cite=DA01]. In homogeneous plasmas D'Angelo mode is a purely growing with zero frequency and growth rate [formula], where [formula] is the ion sound velocity, ky and kz are the components of the wave vector across and along the magnetic field respectively, [formula] is the normalized ion flow velocity shear, ωci is the ion cyclotron frequency. Instability develops, when [formula]. This mode has obvious difference with shear flow modified ion sound instability [\cite=Gav], which requires that [formula] and develops due to inverse electron and ion Landau damping. In Ref.[\cite=Mikhailenko07] Mikhailenko et al. by using the kinetic approach, which accounted for the effects of the finite Larmor radius, electron and ion Landau damping, have developed the comprehensive theory of the hydrodynamic and kinetic shear flow modified and shear flow driven low frequency ion-sound-drift instabilities in inhomogeneous plasma shear flow under condition [formula]. The purpose of this paper is to present a kinetic theory of the electrostatic low frequency instabilities of inhomogeneous plasmas under condition [formula], which is key to connection of the investigated instabilities with D'Angelo mode. In contrary to conclusions of Smith and Goeler [\cite=Smith], which have considered this instability on the base of the Vlasov equation and climed[\cite=Smith] that ion Landau damping leads only to modification of this hydrodynamical instability, we find that in short wavelength limit, where hydrodynamic treatment is not valid at all, the ion-kinetic effects are dominant and are responsible for the development of new kinetic instability. Keeping in mind that this instability is characterizes by positive parameter [formula], we nominate it as a kinetic D'Angelo mode. This kinetic D'Angelo mode occurs when velocity shear exceeds the critical value, which equals to one for the development of the hydrodynamic D'Angelo mode [\cite=DA65] and develops due to inverse ion Landau damping. We find, that for the velocity shear less or of the order of the critical value the kinetic D'Angelo mode transforms into the drift instability, which has a similar mechanism of excitation.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 the dispersion relation for D'Angelo mode obtained by using the kinetic approach is represented. In Sec. 3 the hydrodynamic D'Angelo mode for inhomogeneous plasma shortly reviewed with accounting for the effects of finite ion Larmor radius. Sec. 4 is devoted to analysis of the kinetic D'Angelo mode in the short wavelength limit. In Sec. 5 the drift instability when the velocity shear less of order the critical value is considered. Also here a numerical analysis is presented. Conclusions are given in Sec. 6.

DISPERSION RELATION FOR LOW-FREQUENCY INSTABILITIES DRIVEN BY SHEAR FLOW

We consider the inhomogeneous sheared plasma flow with one ion species which moves with velocity [formula]. The general dispersion relation in the kinetic Vlasov-Poisson model was obtained in Ref.[\cite=Mikhailenko06]

[formula]

where λDα is the Debye length, ωcα and [formula] are the cyclotron frequency and thermal velocity respectively, [formula], In is the modified Bessel function, [formula], ρTi  =  vTi  /  ωci is the thermal Larmor radius, [formula], [formula], [formula] is the diamagnetic drift velocity, and [formula]. In Eq. ([\ref=1]) is assumed that the local approximation, [formula] and [formula], where [formula], [formula], holds.

We consider the low frequency instability when the condition [formula] is met, so the zero term in the sum over cyclotron harmonics in Eq. ([\ref=1]) is the dominant. We suppose that electrons are adiabatical with |ze0|  ≪  1, and |zi0| may be greater or less than unity, whereas |zin| > 1 for [formula]. The last condition is valid, when inequality kzρTi < 1 is satisfied. Using the asymptotic form for W - function for large argument values, [formula], we carry out the summation over all cyclotron harmonics with [formula]. Then dispersion relation ([\ref=1]) reduces to the form

[formula]

where τ = Ti / Te. In Eq. ([\ref=2]) the variables λ = 1 / kzρTi and [formula], which are the normalized wavelength along the magnetic field and complex frequency respectively, are used. Eq. ([\ref=2]) is the general dispersion relation for the low frequency perturbations which takes into account effects of the velocity shear, thermal motion of ions, both along and across the magnetic field, as well as the plasma density inhomogeneity. The analytical solution to Eq. ([\ref=2]) in general case for arbitrary λ and zi0 values can not be found. However, it admits an approximate solution in asymptotic limits of long as well as short wavelengths along the magnetic field, when the effect of ion Landau damping is negligible or dominant, respectively. In the long wavelength limit, this equation gives hydrodynamic shear-flow-driven instability, known as D'Angelo mode. In the short wavelength range, the source of free energy for instability is also a shear velocity, however the excitation of instability occurs via the inverse Landau damping and therefore this instability is nominated as the ion kinetic D'Angelo mode.

HYDRODYNAMIC D'ANGELO MODE

In the long wavelength limit, when inequality [formula] is met and ion Landau damping is negligible, the dispersion relation ([\ref=2]) reduces to the form

[formula]

This equation gives the classical hydrodynamic D'Angelo mode [\cite=DA65], which, in addition, accounts for the thermal motion of ions across the magnetic field. The frequency and growth rate of this mode respectively are

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the drift wave frequency. It follows from Eq.([\ref=4]), that the hydrodynamic D'Angelo mode occurs in the wavelengths range λ2  <  λ  <  λ1, where

[formula]

The hydrodynamic D'Angelo mode exists when λ1 and λ2 are both real and positive. The condition of the wavelength positivity is satisfied when inequality kyρTiSi > 0 is met, whereas the wavelengths are real when the flow velocity shear satisfies inequality

[formula]

In the limiting case [formula] and τ = 1, inequality ([\ref=7]) reduces to the condition [formula] obtained by D'Angelo in the fluid treatment [\cite=DA65]. Under condition ([\ref=7]) the growth rate ([\ref=4]) has a maximum at λ0 = 2 / kyρTiSi.

The condition for validation of hydrodynamic treatment, [formula], at the extremities of interval [formula], as well as in the point of the growth rate maximum, λ0, should be verified also. At the long wavelength boundary,

[formula]

the modulus of normalized frequency is approximately equals

[formula]

and hydrodynamic treatment is met at [formula]. This inequality is the less strict than ([\ref=7]) and therefore it holds if inequality ([\ref=7]) is satisfied. In the point of the growth rate maximum, the modulus of normalized frequency is

[formula]

and under condition ([\ref=7]) inequality [formula] is not met here. This condition at λ  =  λ2 is not satisfied also. Hence the problem of the D'Angelo mode at the short wavelength threshold, as well as in the maximum of the growth rate can not be solved in the hydrodynamic treatment.

KINETIC D'ANGELO MODE

In order to investigate the D'Angelo mode in the short wave limit, when Landau damping is dominant, we consider Eq. ([\ref=2]) in general form without appealing to the asymptotic forms of W function. Find first the short wavelength threshold of the D'Angelo mode. The threshold values for variables λ and zi0 are determined by the balance of the velocity shear, plasma inhomogeneity as well as thermal motion effects in ion Landau damping and may be obtained by equating to zero the real and imaginary parts of Eq. ([\ref=2]),

[formula]

System of equations ([\ref=11]) has a solution, when inequality kyρTiSi > 0 is met. The short-wavelength threshold value λs for the excitation of the instability, as well as the threshold value of the normalized complex frequency zs, which is the real at that threshold, are

[formula]

[formula]

where index s means the short-wavelength instability threshold. The approximate solution to Eq.([\ref=2]) in the vicinity of instability threshold, we obtain by Taylor series expansion of Eq.([\ref=3]) in powers of [formula] with retained only zero-order and linear terms,

[formula]

Here [formula] and ε'λ and ε'z are determined by

[formula]

[formula]

The expression ([\ref=14]) does not claim to be exact solution of dispersion relation, however it will give the ability to determine the condition on the velocity shear at which the D'Angelo mode in short wavelength range occurs. The waves frequency and the growth rate in the vicinity of the instability threshold can be obtained from Eq. ([\ref=14]) as

[formula]

[formula]

As follows from Eq. ([\ref=18]) the D'Angelo mode is a stable for the wavelengths along the magnetic field which are satisfied to inequality λ  ≤  λs, whereas for waves with λ  >  λs it becomes unstable. The instability is induced due to effect of inverse ion Landau damping which occurs when the free energy of velocity shear exceeds the absorption of energy by ion thermal motion along the magnetic field and plasma inhomogeneity. Formally the instability exists for arbitrary magnitudes of the velocity shear for wavelengths λ  >  λs. However because [formula], the instability growth rate ([\ref=18]) is exponentially small in the vicinity of the threshold when [formula] and it is not exponentially small when [formula]. Lust inequality gives in fact the necessary condition on normalized shear, at which the D'Angelo mode is unstable. Accounting for Eq.([\ref=13]) yields

[formula]

In the [formula] limit and for τ = 1 inequality ([\ref=19]) reduces to [formula] which coincides with that obtained by D'Angelo in the fluid treatment [\cite=DA65]. The magnitude of the growth rate is affected also by factor [formula] which gives the maximum of the growth rate at [formula].

This kinetic instability reveals the main properties of the hydrodynamic D'Angelo mode, such as an increase in growth rate with increasing of velocity shear and it decreases with increasing of plasma inhomogeneity. The latter property, however, is manifested only in the quadratic term of the expansion ([\ref=14]), which is omitted here because of its lengthy form. It is interesting to note, that the boundary wavelength ([\ref=12]) for the kinetic mode is independent on the plasma inhomogeneity, in distinction from hydrodynamic mode. Thus, the D'Angelo mode in the vicinity of the short wave threshold λs occurs due to inverse ion Landau damping which is caused by the parallel velocity shear and it is the ion-kinetic D'Angelo mode. The necessary condition on velocity shear value is expressed by Eq. ([\ref=19]). The most unstable waves are those with transverse wave numbers [formula].

The growth rate of the ion-kinetic D'Angelo mode ([\ref=18]) increases with an increase of wavelength until condition [formula] holds. With subsequent increases of the wavelength, so that inequality [formula] is met, the role of kinetic effects on the development of the D'Angelo mode reduces, whereas the hydrodynamic mechanism becomes dominant and ion-kinetic D'Angelo mode transformes gradually into the classical hydrodynamic D'Angelo mode. In the transition wavelength region, where [formula] and both the kinetic and hydrodynamic effects are significant, an analytic solution of Eq. ([\ref=2]) not obtained. The corresponding range of the wavelengths along the magnetic field may be studied only numerically.

ION-KINETIC SHEAR-FLOW-DRIVEN DRIFT INSTABILITY

When the velocity shear satisfies inequality [formula], so that [formula], the D'Angelo mode does not exist, whereas the kinetic growth rate, though small compared to D'Angelo mode, but is not equal to zero. In the asymptotic limit [formula], the dispersion relation ([\ref=2]) for inhomogeneous plasmas has a form

[formula]

which is almost a same as Eq. ([\ref=3]), but we retain in the ([\ref=20]) the ion Landau damping term. The frequency of instability,

[formula]

corresponds to the drift waves modified by velocity shear. Therefore this waves may be identified as a drift waves. The growth rate of the drift instability,

[formula]

is positive for wavelengths λ  >  λs, so, the drift instability, as well as the ion kinetic d'Angelo mode, is excited due to inverse ion Landau damping. The maximum of the growth rate occurs approximately at wavelength

[formula]

With increasing wavelengths at λ  >  λ0, the growth rate decreases exponentially.

In order to verify the results of analytical calculations, we solved numerically the dispersion relation ([\ref=1]) in the frequency range ω  ≪  ωci. Figure [\ref=Fig.1] shows the growth rate of instability versus the normalized wavelength for the different magnitudes of normalized velocity shear, Si = 0.3, Si = 0.2, and Si = 0.1 (curves 1, 2 and 3), which appropriate to ionospheric parameters [\cite=Amatucci]. Here we take also |vdi| / vTi = 0.1, kyρTi = 0.5, τ = 1. The condition for velocity shear ([\ref=19]) is satisfied only for the first two values of shear, so that only curves 1 and 2 present the D'Angelo mode, whereas curve 3 presents the drift instability. For these conditions, the value of |zs| at the short wavelength boundary is equal to 0.4, 0.6 and 1.2, respectively. The short-wavelength boundary λs calculated from Eq. ([\ref=13]) is equal approximately to 17, 25 and 51, respectively, which agrees with Figure data. The long-wavelength boundary λ1 of the hydrodynamic D'Angelo mode for Si = 0.3 and Si = 0.2 was calculated from Eq. ([\ref=9]) and is equal to 360 and 235, respectively. The growth rate for curves 1 and 2 has a maximum at wavelengths corresponding to [formula] i. e. in the transient kinetic-hydrodynamic range of the longitudinal wavelengths, where the kinetic and hydrodynamic effects are significant both. For shear value Si = 0.1 (curve 3), the condition of hydrodynamic approach ([\ref=8]) does not satisfied, and thus D'Angelo mode does not develop. So this mode is the kinetic shear-flow driven drift instability. The point of the maximal growth rate for this instability, calculated from Eq. ([\ref=23]), is approximately equal [formula], which is slight less than the value from the Figure.

CONCLUSIONS

An extension of hydrodynamic D'Angelo mode of inhomogeneous sheared plasma flow along the magnetic field into the short-wavelength limit, where the hydrodynamic treatment is not valid, has been considered. We find that D'Angelo mode in this wavelength range is excited by inverse ion Landau damping and becomes the shear flow driven ion-kinetic mode. The short-wavelength boundary for the wave number component along the magnetic field λs ([\ref=12]) of instability development is determined by the balance of shear flow, plasma inhomogeneity and thermal motion effects in ion Landau damping. The kinetic D'Angelo mode is induced for the wavelengths λ  >  λs and velocity shear S > Si0, where [formula] is the critical value. This condition for velocity shear is the same as for the ordinary D'Angelo mode [\cite=DA65], so that kinetic and hydrodynamic D'Angelo modes exist simultaneously both in different wavelength regions. The kinetic D'Angelo mode reveals the main properties of the hydrodynamic D'Angelo mode, such as an increase in growth rate with increasing of velocity shear; and it decreases with increasing of plasma inhomogeneity. However, the short wavelength boundary ([\ref=11]) for the kinetic mode appears to be independent on the plasma inhomogeneity unlike the long wavelength boundary ([\ref=8]) of hydrodynamic mode. The maximum of the growth rate of D'Angelo mode occurs in transient wavelength range, where both the kinetic and hydrodynamic effects are significant. For velocity shear value [formula] and wavelengths λ  <  λs the D'Angelo mode does not exist, however, the ion-kinetic drift instability at λ  >  λs is developed due to velocity shear. This instability occurs as the kinetic D'Angelo mode, when the free energy of velocity shear exceeds the absorption of energy by ion thermal motion along the magnetic field and plasma inhomogeneity. Formally, this instability exists for arbitrary magnitudes of the velocity shear for wavelengths λ  >  λs, however its growth rate ([\ref=19]) is exponentially small, when [formula].
