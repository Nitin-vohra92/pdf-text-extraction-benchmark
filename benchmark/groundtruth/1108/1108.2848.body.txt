Topological monoids of monotone injective partial selfmaps of [formula] with cofinite domain and image

Introduction and preliminaries

Our purpose is to study the semigroup [formula] of partial cofinal monotone bijective transformations of the set of positive integers [formula]. We shall show that the semigroup [formula] has algebraic properties similar to the bicyclic semigroup: it is bisimple and all of its nontrivial group homomorphisms are either isomorphisms or group homomorphisms. We shall also prove that every locally compact topology τ on [formula] such that [formula] is a topological inverse semigroup is discrete and we shall describe the closure of [formula] in a topological semigroup.

In this paper all spaces will be assumed to be Hausdorff. Furthermore we shall follow the terminology of [\cite=CHK] [\cite=CP] [\cite=Engelking1989]. We shall denote the first infinite cardinal by ω and the cardinality of the set A by |A|. If Y is a subspace of a topological space X and A  ⊆  Y, then we shall denote the topological closure and the interior of A in Y by [formula] and [formula], respectively.

An algebraic semigroup S is called inverse if for any element x∈S there exists a unique x- 1∈S such that xx- 1x = x and x- 1xx- 1 = x- 1. The element x- 1 is called the inverse of x∈S. If S is an inverse semigroup, then the function [formula] which assigns to every element x of S its inverse element x- 1 is called an inversion.

If S is a semigroup, then we shall denote the band (i. e. the subset of idempotents) of S by E(S). If the band E(S) is a nonempty subset of S, then the semigroup operation on S determines the partial order [formula] on E(S): [formula] if and only if ef = fe = e. This order is called natural.

A semilattice is a commutative semigroup of idempotents. A semilattice E is called linearly ordered or chain if the semilattice operation admits a linear natural order on E. A maximal chain of a semilattice E is a chain which is properly contained in no other chain of E. The Axiom of Choice implies the existence of maximal chains in any partially ordered set. According to [\cite=Petrich1984] a chain L is called an ω-chain if L is isomorphic to [formula] with the usual order [formula]. Let E be a semilattice and e∈E. We denote [formula] and [formula].

A topological (inverse) semigroup is a topological space together with a continuous multiplication (and an inversion, respectively). Let [formula] denote the set of all partial one-to-one transformations of a set X of cardinality λ together with the following semigroup operation: x(αβ) = (xα)β if [formula], for [formula]. The semigroup [formula] is called the symmetric inverse semigroup over the set X (see [\cite=CP]). The symmetric inverse semigroup was introduced by Wagner [\cite=Wagner1952] and it plays a major role in the theory of semigroups.

Let [formula] be the set of all positive integers. We shall denote the semigroup of monotone, non-decreasing, injective partial transformations of [formula] such that the sets [formula] and [formula] are finite for all [formula] by [formula] . Obviously, [formula] is an inverse subsemigroup of the semigroup [formula]. The semigroup [formula] is called the semigroup of cofinite monotone partial bijections of [formula].

We shall denote every element α of the semigroup [formula] by [formula] and this means that α maps the positive integer ni into mi for all [formula] . In this case the following conditions hold:

the sets [formula] and [formula] are finite; and

[formula] and [formula] .

We observe that an element α of the semigroup [formula] is an element of the semigroup [formula] if and only if it satisfies the conditions (i) and (ii).

The bicyclic semigroup [formula] is the semigroup with the identity 1, generated by elements p and q, subject only to the condition pq = 1. The bicyclic semigroup is bisimple and every one of its congruences is either trivial or a group congruence. Moreover, every non-annihilating homomorphism h of the bicyclic semigroup is either an isomorphism or the image of [formula] under h is a cyclic group (see [\cite=CP]). The bicyclic semigroup plays an important role in algebraic theory of semigroups and in the theory of topological semigroups.

For example, the well-known result of Andersen [\cite=Andersen] states that a (0-)simple semigroup is completely (0-)simple if and only if it does not contain the bicyclic semigroup. The bicyclic semigroup admits only the discrete topology and a topological semigroup S can contain [formula] only as an open subset [\cite=EberhartSelden1969]. Neither stable nor Γ-compact topological semigroups can contain a copy of the bicyclic semigroup [\cite=AHK] [\cite=HildebrantKoch1988]. Also, the bicyclic semigroup does not embed into a countably compact topological inverse semigroup [\cite=GutikRepovs2007].

Moreover, the conditions were given in [\cite=BanakhDimitrovaGutik2009] and [\cite=BanakhDimitrovaGutik20??] when a countable compact or pseudocompact topological semigroup does not contain the bicyclic semigroup. However, Banakh, Dimitrova and Gutik constructed, using set-theoretic assumptions (Continuum Hypothesis or Martin Axiom), an example of a Tychonoff countably compact topological semigroup which contains the bicyclic semigroup [\cite=BanakhDimitrovaGutik20??].

We remark that the bicyclic semigroup is isomorphic to the semigroup [formula] which is generated by partial transformations α and β of the set of positive integers [formula], defined as follows: Therefore the semigroup [formula] contains an isomorphic copy of the bicyclic semigroup [formula].

Algebraic properties of the semigroup [formula]

The following properties hold:

[formula] is a simple semigroup.

[formula] [formula] in [formula] if and only if [formula] [formula].

[formula] in [formula] if and only if α  =  β.

For every [formula] there exists [formula] such that αα- 1  =  ε and α- 1α  =  ι.

[formula] is a bisimple semigroup.

If [formula], then [formula] if and only if [formula].

The semilattice [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] under the mapping [formula].

Every maximal chain in [formula] is an ω-chain.

(i) Let [formula] and [formula] be any elements of the semigroup [formula], where [formula] for [formula] . We put

[formula]

Then we have that γαδ  =  β. Therefore [formula] for any [formula] and hence [formula] is a simple semigroup.

Statement (ii) follows from definitions of relations [formula] and [formula] and Theorem 1.17 of [\cite=CP]. Also, (ii) implies (iii). For the idempotents [formula] and [formula] we put [formula]. Then αα- 1  =  ε and α- 1α  =  ι, and hence (iv) holds. Also, (v) follows from (ii). All other assertions are trivial.

For every [formula] both sets [formula] and [formula] are finite. Consequently, every right translation and every left translation by an element of the semigroup [formula] is a finite-to-one map.

We denote [formula] and [formula]. Then A  ⊆  B and the restriction of any partial map χ∈B to [formula] coincides with the partial map α- 1  ·  β. Since every partial map from [formula] is monotone and non-decreasing, the set B is finite and hence so is A.

For every [formula] [formula] and [formula] and put [formula]

For every idempotent ε of the semigroup [formula] there exists an idempotent [formula] such that the following conditions hold:

[formula];

ε0 is the unity of a subsemigroup [formula] of [formula], which is isomorphic to the bicyclic semigroup;   and

[formula].

Let ε be an arbitrary idempotent of the semigroup [formula]. We put n0 = M(ε) + 1 and

[formula]

We define the partial monotone bijections [formula] and [formula] as follows: Let [formula] a semigroup generated by the elements [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] satisfies the conditions (2)--(3) of the lemma and [formula] is the identity of the semigroup [formula] such that [formula].

For every [formula] there exist [formula] and [formula] such that λ  ·  ε  =  μ  ·  ε and ε  ·  λ  =  ε  ·  μ.

The definition of the semigroup [formula] implies that for every [formula] the notions [formula], [formula] and M(γ) exist and they are unique, and hence they are well-defined.

We define partial maps [formula] and [formula] as follows: [formula] and (i)μ = (i)λ for all [formula] and [formula] and (i)μ = i for all [formula]. Then we have λ  ·  ε  =  μ  ·  ε and ε  ·  λ  =  ε  ·  μ.

The proof of the following lemma is similar to the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma-2.4].

For every idempotent [formula] there exists [formula] such that [formula]. More than, [formula] for every [formula] such that [formula].

For every idempotent [formula] there exists [formula] such that [formula].

The definition of [formula] implies that there exists a maximal positive integer nε such that [formula]. We put [formula] Then we get [formula] and [formula].

For every element [formula] there exists an idempotent ε of the subsemigroup [formula] such that [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=lemma-2.4] there exists [formula] and [formula] such that λ  ·  ε  =  μ  ·  ε and ε  ·  λ  =  ε  ·  μ. Therefore, we have that and similarly [formula]

Let S be a semigroup and [formula] a homomorphism such that (ε)h = (φ)h for some distinct idempotents [formula]. Then (ε)h = (ψ)h, for every [formula].

We consider the following cases:

[formula];

ε and φ are distinct comparable idempotents of [formula];

ε and φ are distinct incomparable idempotents of [formula].

Suppose case (1) holds. Then by Corollary 1.32 of [\cite=CP] we have that (χ)h = (ε)h for every [formula]. Let ψ be any idempotent of [formula] such that [formula]. Then by Proposition [\ref=proposition-2.1](v) there exists [formula] such that γ  ·  γ- 1  =  ε and γ- 1  ·  γ  =  ψ. By Lemma [\ref=lemma-2.4c] there exist [formula] such that [formula]. Therefore, we have that

Suppose case (2) holds. Without loss of generality we can assume that [formula]. Then (ε)h = (ε1)h = (φ)h for every idempotent [formula] such that [formula]. Therefore, without loss of generality we can assume that [formula] is singleton. Let [formula]. Let j be the minimal integer of [formula] such that (i)ε = i for all [formula]. We put [formula] Then λ- 1  ·  ε0  ·  φ  ·  ε0  ·  λ and λ- 1  ·  ε0  ·  ε  ·  ε0  ·  λ are distinct idempotents of the subsemigroup [formula]. Therefore, we have that and hence case (1) holds.

Suppose case (3) holds. Then we have that (ε)h = (ε  ·  ε)h = (ε)h  ·  (ε)h = (ε)h  ·  (φ)h = (ε  ·  φ)h. Since the idempotents ε and φ are distinct and incomparable we conclude that ε  ·  φ  <  ε and ε  ·  φ  <  φ, and hence case (2) holds.

Let S be a semigroup and [formula] a non-annihilating homomorphism. Then either h is a monomorphism or [formula] is a cyclic subgroup of S.

Suppose that [formula] is not an isomorphism "into". Then (α)h = (β)h, for some distinct [formula]. Since [formula] is an inverse semigroup we conclude that and hence (αα- 1)h = (ββ- 1)h. Therefore the assertion of Lemma [\ref=lemma-2.3] holds. Since every homomorphic image of an inverse semigroup is an inverse semigroup we conclude that [formula] is a subgroup of S.

Since the map [formula] is a group homomorphism we have that h generates a group congruence [formula] on [formula]. If [formula] is any congruence on the semigroup [formula] then the mapping [formula] maps the congruence [formula] onto a group congruence [formula], where [formula] is the least group congruence on [formula] (cf. [\cite=Petrich1984]).

Such a mapping is a map from the lattice of all congruences of the semigroup [formula] onto the lattice of all group congruences of [formula]  [\cite=Petrich1984]. By Lemma III.5.2 of [\cite=Petrich1984], the elements γ and δ of the semigroup [formula] are [formula]-equivalent if and only if there exists an idempotent [formula] such that γ  ·  ε  =  δ  ·  ε. Lemma [\ref=lemma-2.4] implies that for every [formula] there exists [formula] such that [formula]. Therefore the least group congruence [formula] on [formula] induces the least group congruence on its subsemigroup [formula].

We observe that [formula] in [formula] (or in [formula]) if and only if there exists a positive integer i such that the restrictions of the partial mapping γ and δ onto the set [formula] coincide. Then we define the map [formula] onto the additive group of integers as follow:

[formula]

The definition of the semigroup [formula] implies that such a map f is well-defined. The map [formula] generates the least group congruence [formula] on the semigroup [formula] and hence f is a group homomorphism. This completes the proof of the theorem.

We observe that the following conditions are equivalent:

[formula] in [formula];

there exists [formula] such that ε  ·  γ  =  ε  ·  δ;

there exists [formula] such that ε  ·  γ  =  ε  ·  δ; and

there exists [formula] such that γ  ·  ε  =  δ  ·  ε.

On topological semigroup [formula]

If E is an infinite semilattice satisfying that [formula] is finite for all e∈E, then the only locally compact, Hausdorff topology relative to which E is a topological semilattice is the discrete topology.

Assume that E has a locally compact, Hausdorff topology under which it is a topological semilattice, and that E has a non-isolated point e in this topology. Since E is Hausdorff, every neighbourhood of e has infinitely many elements. Let K be a compact neighbourhood of e. Then there is a net [formula] with lim iei = e. Since E is a topological semilattice, e = e2 = e  ·   lim iei  =   lim i(e  ·  ei), and since [formula] is finite, we can assume that e  ·  ei < e are distinct for all [formula]. Since [formula], we can also assume [formula] for all i. Thus, we can assume ei < e satisfy [formula] for all i.

Choose one such ej, and then note that ej = ej  ·  e = ej  ·   lim iei  =   lim i(ej  ·  ei). The same argument we just gave for e then implies that ei < ej for all i, that lim iei = ej, and that [formula] for all i. We let e1 = ej, and now repeat the argument. Since K is compact, this sequence has a limit point, s in K, and the continuity of the semilattice operation implies s is another idempotent and that s < en for all n. But then [formula] is infinite, contrary to our hypothesis. Hence E cannot have a nonisolated point, so it is discrete.

Proposition [\ref=proposition-2.1a] and Lemma [\ref=referee] imply the following:

If [formula] is a locally compact Hausdorff topological semigroup, then [formula] with the induces from [formula] topology is a discrete topological semilattice.

Every locally compact Hausdorff topology on the semigroup [formula] such that [formula] is a topological inverse semigroup, is discrete.

By Lemma [\ref=lemma-3.2], the band [formula] is a discrete topological space. Since [formula] is a topological inverse semigroup, the maps [formula] and [formula] defines by the formulae (α)h = α  ·  α- 1 and (α)f = α- 1  ·  α are continuous and for every two idempotents ε and φ of the semigroup [formula] there exists a unique element χ in [formula] such that χ  ·  χ- 1  =  ε and χ- 1  ·  χ  =  φ, we have that every element of the topological semigroup [formula] is an isolated point of the topological space [formula].

The following theorem describes the closure of the discrete semigroup [formula] in a topological semigroup.

If a topological semigroup S contains [formula] as a proper, dense discrete subsemigroup, then [formula] is an open subsemigroup of S and [formula] is an ideal of S.

The first assertion of the theorem follows from Theorem 3.3.9 of [\cite=Engelking1989].

Suppose that [formula] and α∈S. If [formula] then there exist open neighbourhoods U(χ) and U(α) of χ and α in S, respectively, such that U(χ)  ·  U(α) = {χ  ·  α}. We observe that the set [formula] is infinite and fix any point [formula]. Hence we have This contradicts Proposition [\ref=proposition-2.1a]. The obtained contradiction implies that [formula].

The proof of the assertion [formula] is similar.

Theorems [\ref=theorem-3.3] and [\ref=theorem-3.4] imply the following:

If a topological semigroup S contains [formula] as a proper, dense locally compact subsemigroup, then [formula] is an open subsemigroup of S and [formula] is an ideal of S.

The following example shows that a remainder of a closure of the discrete (and hence of a locally compact topological inverse) semigroup [formula] in a topological inverse semigroup contains only a zero element.

Let [formula] be a discrete topological semigroup and let S be the semigroup [formula] with adjoined zero [formula], i.e. [formula] for all [formula]. We define a topology τ on S as follows:

all non-zero elements of the semigroup S are isolated points in (S,τ); and

the family [formula], where [formula] determines a base of the topology τ at the point [formula].

We observe that (S,τ) is a topological inverse semigroup which contains [formula] as a dense subsemigroup and τ is not a locally compact topology on [formula].

We recall that a topological space X is said to be:

countably compact if each closed discrete subspace of X is finite;

pseudocompact if X is Tychonoff and each continuous real-valued function on X is bounded;

sequentially compact if each sequence [formula] has a convergent subsequence.

A topological semigroup S is called Γ-compact if for every x∈S the closure of the set [formula] is a compactum in S (see [\cite=HildebrantKoch1988]). Since the semigroup [formula] contains the bicyclic semigroup as a subsemigroup the results obtained in [\cite=AHK], [\cite=BanakhDimitrovaGutik2009], [\cite=BanakhDimitrovaGutik20??], [\cite=GutikRepovs2007], [\cite=HildebrantKoch1988] imply that if a topological semigroup S satisfies one of the following conditions: (i) S is compact; (ii) S is Γ-compact; (iii) the square S  ×  S is countably compact; (iv) S is a countably compact topological inverse semigroup; or (v) the square S  ×  S is a Tychonoff pseudocompact space, then S does not contain the semigroup [formula].

The following example shows that the semigroup [formula] embeds into a locally compact topological semigroup as a discrete subsemigroup.

Let [formula] be the additive group of integers. Let [formula] be a group homomorphism defined by the formula ([\ref=equation-2.a]). On the set [formula] we define the semigroup operation '[formula]' as follows: where '·  ' and '+  ' are the semigroup operation in [formula] and the group operation in [formula], respectively. The semigroup S is called the adjunction semigroup of [formula] and [formula] relative to homomorphism h (see [\cite=CHK]).

Let [formula] be the canonical partial order on the semigroup [formula] (see [\cite=Petrich1984]), i. e. We observe that if [formula] in [formula], then (α)h = (β)h. For every [formula] and [formula] such that (α)h = x we put

We define a topology τ on S as follows:

all elements of the subsemigroup [formula] are isolated points in (S,τ); and

the family [formula] determines a base of the topology at the point [formula].

Simple verifications show that (S,τ) is a 0-dimensional locally compact topological inverse semigroup.
