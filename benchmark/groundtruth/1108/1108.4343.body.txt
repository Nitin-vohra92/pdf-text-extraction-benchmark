The Magnetic Force as a Kinematical Consequence of the Thomas Precession

Introduction

The rest frames of charged particles interacting electrodynamically are known to rotate relative to the laboratory inertial reference frame, as well as mutually, due to the Thomas precession [\cite=Thomas1927]. Kinematics typically requires that when a reference frame rotates relative to an inertial reference frame, rotational pseudoforces must be present in the rotating frame. However, it is clear that Thomas precession cannot cause rotational pseudoforces in general, because it depends only on the relative motion between two reference frames, and the Thomas precessing frame may be an inertial frame if the observer is accelerating. Thus, for example, since there can be no Coriolis force in the rest frame of a field-source charged particle that is only translating with constant velocity, an observer co-moving with a charged test particle that is translating relative to the field-source particle, and cross-accelerating relative to the translation, must infer the presence of forces that compensate for the lack of Coriolis force the observer expects due to the observed Thomas precession.

It is contended in the present contribution that the necessity of an observer moving non-inertially to infer pseudoforce-compensating forces implies even in inertial frames the existence of related forces, that will be herein referred to as anti-pseudoforces, the most obvious of which can be recognized as the magnetic part of the Lorentz force. The formal similarity of the magnetic force to a Coriolis force is viewed as a direct consequence of it arising as an anti-Coriolis force. Similar reasoning when extended to centrifugal and Euler pseudoforces implies the existence of other tangible forces. These may provide non-quantum mechanical bases for the strong and weak forces. Also, when a magnetic field source charge is accelerating as well as translating, an additional magnetic-like force must be expected, that plausibly may account for the non-classical gyromagnetic ratio of the intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron. It is shown further that under highly relativistic and short range conditions, the force on a charged particle due to the magnetic acceleration field can behave similarly to predicted anticentrifugal force. That is, the magnetic field of an accelerating charge can cause a force between two charges that is attractive independent of the relative polarity of the charges, and can overcome Coulombic repulsion at nucleonic scale in the highly relativistic limit.

Similarity of the Magnetic Force to a Coriolis Force

In this section the approximate Lorentz force on a charged test particle interacting electromagnetically with another charged particle is determined and the magnetic part of the interaction identified, and then it is shown how the magnetic force may be interpreted as an anti-Coriolis force. The anti-Coriolis force acts in any inertial reference frame where both the field source particle and test particle are moving.

Interaction of Two Charged Particles, Where One Particle is Non-Accelerating

The relativistic law of inertia for a massive particle of momentum [formula] and rest mass m, acted on by a force [formula] is

[formula]

where [formula] is the particle velocity and [formula] its acceleration, and [formula] with [formula] and c the speed of light. The acceleration due to [formula] is thus

[formula]

where [formula] (and using the well-known identity that [formula]). The force of interest is the Lorentz force on a moving charged particle in the electromagnetic field caused by another moving charged particle. In this case the electromagnetic field is exactly described by the Liénard-Wiechert field expressions [\cite=jcksn:classelec]. The Liénard-Wiechert field expressions in three-vector notation are

and

[formula]

where, if [formula] is the displacement from a field-source charged particle at the retarded time [formula] to a field point at time t, then [formula], and   =   / R. Also [formula], where [formula] is the field-source particle velocity. The subscript "ret" refers to that the quantity in the brackets is evaluated at the retarded time.

The first term on the right hand side of Eq. ([\ref=LW_E_field]) is called the velocity, or non-radiative, electric field. The second is called the acceleration or radiative electric field. In the present application, with the electromagnetic field caused by a non-accelerating charge, the acceleration fields vanish identically. It can also be seen by inspection that the magnitude of the field difference from the Coulomb field of the particle (that is, the electric field in the rest frame of the particle) due to motion is small when β <  < 1. Since the magnetic force strength is generally of order (v / c)2 compared to the Coulomb force, it will be sufficient to represent all forces and fields only to this order.

From ([\ref=LW_E_field]) and with the source particle non-accelerating, the electric field is exactly

[formula]

and the magnetic field is approximated to order (v / c)2 as

[formula]

Let s and t represent position vectors to an electromagnetic field source particle of mass ms, and a test particle of mass mt, in an inertial reference frame (IRF) that will be referred to herein as the laboratory frame, and [formula]. The velocities of both the source and test particles are assumed nonvanishing in the laboratory frame. It is also assumed for simplicity that the particles have no intrinsic magnetic moments. The Lorentz force on the test particle in the laboratory frame is then

[formula]

For the uniformly translating field source particle, it is straightforward to evaluate the retardation effects explicitly and rewrite Eq. ([\ref=TotalLorentzForce]) in terms of non-retarded quantites. The result accurate to order (v / c)2 is

[formula]

If the force is considered as consisting of electric and magnetic parts so that [formula], it will be useful to further consider the electric part of the force as consisting of a Coulomb force plus additional terms that are at order β and higher powers of β, where the Coulomb part of the electric force is

[formula]

The acceleration of the test particle due to the Coulomb force, using Eq. ([\ref=accel_from_RLOM]), is

[formula]

which to order (v / c)2 is

[formula]

The acceleration of the test particle due to the Coulomb force, neglecting the relativistic terms from Eq. ([\ref=Coul_accel_from_RLOM_approx]) that are of order β2 and higher, is then

[formula]

If we let [formula] with

[formula]

then the magnetic force can be written using Eq. ([\ref=B_field]) as

[formula]

with

[formula]

where [formula] is the Coulomb acceleration of the test particle as given by Eq. ([\ref=Coulomb_accel]).

Now, Eq. ([\ref=CoriolisLikeForce]) shows that the magnetic force on the test particle is formally identical to a Coriolis force that would be present if the reference frame of the description was rotating with angular velocity as given by Eq. ([\ref=DerivedAngularVelocity]). The sign choice made on the right hand side of the equality of ([\ref=CoriolisLikeForce]) is opposite to that of a Coriolis force, however, anticipating (as will be shown) that the magnetic force is not actually a Coriolis force, but rather is a kinematical consequence of the absence of a Coriolis force in the source particle rest frame, in spite the perception by the observer co-moving with test particle that the source frame is gyrating. No inertial effects of the Thomas precession can be noticed in either the source rest frame or the laboratory frame, as the Thomas precession itself is seen only by the relatively-accelerating observer co-moving with the test particle. Furthermore, the above angular velocity expression can be related to the expression for the Thomas precession [\cite=jcksn:classelec] in the limit of small v / c, of the rest frame of a particle with velocity [formula] and acceleration [formula] relative to the observer seeing the Thomas precession. That is,

[formula]

The acceleration of coordinate axes that are fixed in the laboratory frame, relative to the observer co-moving with the test particle, is simply the opposite of the test particle acceleration, since the laboratory frame is non-accelerating. Similarly, the relative velocity to the same observer of an object fixed in the laboratory frame is the opposite of the test particle velocity as observed from the laboratory frame. This results in an angular velocity of Thomas precession of the laboratory frame coordinate axes seen by the test particle co-moving observer of

[formula]

which is not equal to the expected angular velocity according to Eq. ([\ref=DerivedAngularVelocity]). In order to derive the magnetic force from Thomas precession seen from the test particle, it will be necessary to consider not just the Thomas precession of the laboratory frame, but also that of the field source particle rest frame, in both cases as seen by the test particle co-moving observer.

The Magnetic Force as a Coriolis Effect of the Thomas Precession

In accordance with Eq. ([\ref=Thomas_av_approx]), the test particle co-moving observer sees any Cartesian coordinate axes that are fixed in the laboratory frame as Thomas precessing with angular velocity

[formula]

The relative angular velocity of the laboratory frame compared to the field-source particle rest frame is then

[formula]

The observer co-moving with the test particle thus sees the laboratory frame as rotating with angular velocity r with respect to the field source particle rest frame. Although the test particle co-moving observer sees both frames as rotating, it is the relative rotation that determines the kinematical relationship between them. If the law of motion is known in either of the two frames, it can be determined in the other using standard kinematics. If the source rest frame is taken as the non-rotating frame, then the test particle co-moving observer predicts that the lab frame equation of motion must be the source frame equation plus the Coriolis, Euler, and centrifugal rotational pseudoforces. These are viewed as anti-pseudoforces since the source frame is rotating with a larger-magnitude angular velocity than the lab frame, from the point of view of the test particle rest frame observer, yet the electromagnetic interaction in the source particle rest frame is perfectly radial in general and so apparently lacking in any rotational pseudoforces. (This is only to be expected, since an observer co-moving with the uniformly-translating field source particle experiences no Thomas precession.)

The expected anti-Coriolis force in the lab frame relative to the source particle rest frame, as observed from the test particle rest frame is

[formula]

with [formula], or, with the relative angular velocity of the Thomas precession between the source and laboratory frames given by Eq. ([\ref=Thomas_rel_omega]),

[formula]

Using the vector identity   ×  (  ×  )  =  (  ·  )  -  (  ·  ),

[formula]

where [formula] are other relativistic kinematic forces that will be addressed in a sequel that is more explicitly relativistic.

Approximating the test particle acceleration as that due to the Coulomb force due to the source particle according to Eq. ([\ref=Coulomb_accel]) obtains

[formula]

Comparing with Eq. ([\ref=CoriolisLikeForce]), it is apparent that

[formula]

The magnetic force on the test particle is thus interpretable as part of an anti-Coriolis force caused by Thomas precession.

It seems worth remarking that although the Coriolis and other inertial pseudoforces generally are directly proportional to the mass of the object on which they appear to act, the magnetic component of the anti-Coriolis force manifesting here does not depend on the test particle mass. The amount of Thomas precession seen by the test particle rest frame observer is inversely proportional to the test particle mass, which has directly canceled the mass factor that would be otherwise present. Such cancelation of the mass factor is of course essential to admitting the possibilty that the magnetic force is due to a Coriolis effect. However, the argument presented here seems to also be applicable to other situations where such cancelation cannot occur. Specifically, had the field-source particle been allowed to freely accelerate in the Coulomb field of the test particle, then this acceleration would have contributed to the Thomas precession of the source particle rest frame seen by the observer in the test particle rest frame, with amount of additional Thomas precession depending inversely on the mass of field-source particle. Thus, an additional anti-Coriolis force component would be present that would be proportional to the ratio of the test particle to source particle masses. In the case of interactions between equal-mass free particles, this would seem to result in a doubling of the strength of the magnetic interaction.

The magnetic force has been related by other authors to a Coriolis force [\cite=Bergstrom1973], as well as to an anti-Coriolis force [\cite=RoyerY11]. However, those authors do not infer the existence of anti-Euler or anti-centrifugal forces. The apparent incompleteness of the Lorentz force has also been noted previously [\cite=Hadjes:Y10].

Strength of the Anti-Centrifugal Force Compared to Coulomb Repulsion

The same arguments that lead to expectation of an anti-Coriolis force lead also to expectation of an anti-centrifugal force, that can be given notionally as

[formula]

with (using again the formula for the angular velocity of the Thomas precession given in [\cite=jcksn:classelec], but here without specialization to small v / c),

[formula]

for β approaching unity. (The relativistic version of the centrifugal force on which Eq. ([\ref=AntiCentForceDef]) is based, that includes the leading Lorentz factor, γ, is derived in [\cite=ArendtY98].) The anti-centrifugal force according to Eq. ([\ref=AntiCentForceDef]) on one particle due to the other is thus,

[formula]

where [formula], and where the two particles are now distinguished by the subscripts 1 and 2, since the field-source particle is no longer constrained to be non-accelerating, and in fact is accelerating under the influence of the Coulomb field of particle 2. Therefore the notion of a test particle that doesn't influence the field-source particle motion must be abandoned, and the subscripts s and t have been replaced by 1 and 2.

For Coulomb attraction or repulsion in the case of mutual circular motion of the two charged particles and neglecting effects of retardation, Eq. ([\ref=accel_from_RLOM]) gives the acceleration of one of the particles in the laboratory frame due to the velocity electric field according to the exact electric field expression of Eq. ([\ref=LW_E_vel_field]) of the other as

[formula]

In the approximation valid in the highly relativistic case where β1 and β2 approach unity and for circular motion neglecting retardation, and assuming the acceleration of particle 1 is Coulombic (but retaining the inverse γ12 factor in the acceleration according the exact electric field expression of Eq. ([\ref=LW_E_vel_field])), the expected magnitude of the anti-centrifugal force acting on particle 2 is thus

If it is assumed the two particles are of like charge polarity with charge magnitude of the order of the elementary charge, and repulsed by Coulomb repulsion, yet circularly orbiting each other with laboratory-frame velocities near the speed of light, then it will be a simple matter to calculate approximately (i.e., neglecting retardation) at what orbital radius the anticentrifugal force will overcome Coulomb repulsion. This orbital radius can then be compared with the measured size of a nucleon such as the proton.

Equating the anticentrifugal force of Eq. ([\ref=AntiCentForceCirc]) and the magnitude of the electric force based on the electric field of Eq. ([\ref=LW_E_vel_field]) but neglecting retardation obtains, for equal mass particles and asumming |q1| = |q2|  =  e (with e the fundamental charge magnitude) and [formula], and using the proton mass for γm,

[formula]

This orbital radius or (strictly) inter-particle separation is about two orders of magnitude less than the estimated size of the proton [\cite=MohrY11]. Thus the present analysis would seem to indicate that the expected anticentrifugal force of the Thomas precession is too weak to potentially account for the fundamental strong force that binds quarks into nucleons. However, the present contribution should be considered only an interim progress report for an ongoing effort that has yet to take into account important effects such as retardation, that may substantially change the present result.

The Strong Force of Maxwell-Lorentz Electrodynamics

It is worth noting that a force similar to the expected anti-centrifugal force of the Thomas precession can be found in relativistic electrodynamics. Based on the Liénard-Wiechert field expressions provided above as Eqs. ([\ref=LW_E_field]) and ([\ref=LW_B_field]), the magnetic force on particle 2 due to the acceleration field of particle 1 is generally

where here [formula] with [formula]. The acceleration of particle 1 in the electric velocity field of particle 2 is found from Eqs. ([\ref=accel_from_RLOM]) and ([\ref=LW_E_field]), neglecting retardation and assuming mutually circular orbital motion of particle 1 around particle 2, as

[formula]

or, if [formula] with [formula], and still neglecting retardation,

[formula]

Now assume mutual circular motion and let ,, represent orthogonal unit vectors in a right-handed coordinate system, and align [formula] with [formula] and [formula] with 1. Then for circular motion with 2  =    -  1 and |2|  =  |1|  ≈  1, and neglecting retardation, Eq. ([\ref=StrongMagneticForce]) for the magnetic force on particle 2 due to its motion in the magnetic acceleration field of particle 1 becomes

[formula]

Recalling that [formula] is directed towards particle 2 from particle 1, it is apparent that this force is attractive for like charges, as well as for opposite. Also, comparing Eq. ([\ref=StrongMagneticForceCirc]) with Eq. ([\ref=AntiCentForceCirc]), it is apparent that, for mutual circular motion and neglecting retardation,

[formula]

In the case of equal mass particles with γ1  =  γ2 so that [formula], it is apparent that under conditions as stated the magnetic force is approximately equal to the predicted anti-centrifugal force of the Thomas precession.

Errata

This version (v6) differs from previous version particularly in using the formula for the angular velocity of the Thomas precession as found in [\cite=jcksn:classelec], which is equivalent to that found in [\cite=Thomas1927] and [\cite=Moller]. Previous versions used that of Malykin [\cite=MalykinY6], which is further attributable to Ritus [\cite=RitusY7]. The main reason for this change is the realization that changing to the current form for the angular velocity of the Thomas precession gives much better agreement between the predicted anti-centrifugal force of the Thomas precession with the "strong" magnetic force that exists between relativistic charges undergoing Coulombic acceleration at sub-nucleonic scales according to Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics. Realization that the original Thomas precession angular velocity formula leads to close agreement of the predicted anticentrifugal force and the magnetic force according to Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics forced a reexamination of the argument of previous versions that the correspondence between the anti-Coriolis force of the Thomas precession and the Biot-Savart magnetic force (that is, the magnetic force that persists for non-relativistic charge velocities and at long distance, and does not require acceleration of the field-source charge). During this reexamination a sign error was found starting at Eq. (9) of versions 4 and 5. This sign error apparently occurred during a change in notation that was made between versions 3 and 4, where the charged particle subscripts were changed to refer to field source and test particles rather than to an electron and positron (or proton). The sign error of versions 4 and 5 thus does not in itself invalidate the thesis of versions 1 through 3 that kinematical arguments support that the formula for the angular velocity of the Thomas precession according to Malykin is correct. It seems that further analysis will be necessary to settle the issue. A relativistic-kinematics approach that obtains the Biot-Savart force rigorously using sequential Lorentz tranformations of postion from the source particle rest frame to the laboratory and without reference to a magnetic field is underway for this purpose.

Another change from version 5 is the replacement of t in Eq. (19) of version 5 with [formula] (in Eq. (21) in the current version). This reflects that the anti-Coriolis force in the laboratory frame must originate as the lack of a Coriolis force in the field-source particle rest frame, where the velocity of the test particle is (approximately) [formula] rather than t.

The suggestion of versions 4 and 5 that accounting for the acceleration of the field source particle will effectively double the spin-orbit coupling strength of, for example, atomic hydrogen, and so provide an alternative explanation for the "nonclassical" gyromagnetic ratio of the electron is withdrawn. That hypothesis overlooked that the expected doubling of the spin-orbit coupling strength will only occur for equal mass particles, as in, for example, positronium. Also, as observed already in version 5, it is contradicted by "g minus 2" experiments that directly measure the gyromagnetic ratio. However, in atomic hydrogen, the spin-orbit coupling strength is expected to be increased by a factor of 1  +  me / mp, where me and mp are the electron and proton masses, due to acceleration of the proton in the electric field of the electron.

The section of version 5 on the expected anti-Euler force of the Thomas precession (Section VII of version 5) has been removed due to it being based on the formula for the angular velocity of the Thomas precession given in [\cite=MalykinY6], and so now inconsistent with the present version. It would need to be reworked in order to be based on the formula of [\cite=jcksn:classelec].

Concluding Remarks

It has been proposed that relativistic kinematics considerations necessitate that the Thomas precession gives rise to certain forces that resemble the rotational pseudoforces known as the Coriolis, Euler, and centrifugal forces. It has been shown to order v2 / c2 that the predicted anti-Coriolis force of the Thomas precession accounts for the existence of the magnetic force. The possible correspondence of the strong nuclear force to an anti-centrifugal force of the Thomas procession was investigated.

The Magnetic Force as a Purely Relativistic-Kinematic Effect of Coulomb Acceleration

In this section, it is shown explicitly that presence of a magnetic force on a test charge involves necessarily a Coulombic acceleration of the test particle, in at least one inertial reference frame. The argument is based on the interaction of two charged particles, but because one of them is constrained to be non-accelerating, the argument extends by the principle of linear superposition to the case of a magnetic field generated by a current-carrying neutral wire. If, in addition to relatively accelerating, the field-source particle and the test particle are also relatively translating with a component transverse to the acceleration, the field-source particle rest frame is then necessarily Thomas precessing with respect to an observer co-moving with the test particle. This is precisely the condition under which a magnetic force is seen to act on the test particle by an observer in the laboratory frame. Therefore, the magnetic force can always be associated with Thomas precession of the source particle rest frame from the point of view of an observer co-moving with the test particle.

Implications of the Relativistic Law of Inertia

The relativistic law of inertia for the test particle in the field source particle rest frame (which is an inertial frame here since the source particle is non-accelerating) may be written as

[formula]

where the parenthetic superscript (srf) indicates quantities defined in the field-source particle rest frame. The demonstration will proceed by rewriting Eq. ([\ref=SRFLoM]) in terms of laboratory frame quantities. To facilitate evaluation of the left hand side of Eq. ([\ref=SRFLoM]) in terms of lab-frame quanitities, consider (based on the Lorentz transformation as given in Appendix B below) that the time component of the four-vector displacement from the source to the test particle Lorentz transforms from a 4-coordinate system in the laboratory reference frame to one in the field source particle frame, where the origins of both systems are the same event, as

[formula]

where t is the time coordinate, in the laboratory frame, of the test particle when it is at the position t. s is the field-source particle velocity in the laboratory frame. Thus

[formula]

and so (and with the source particle non-accelerating)

[formula]

For the field source particle moving at constant velocity, then,

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

and so

[formula]

Expanding the left hand side of Eq. ([\ref=dPbydtau]) obtains

With the vector identity   ×  (  ×  )  =  (  ·  )  -  (  ·  ),

[formula]

or

[formula]

where

[formula]

The above analysis demonstrates that the magnetic force can be interpreted as a relativistic-kinematic consequence of the acceleration of the test particle by the Coulomb force, and the relative motion of the field-source and test particles.

Lorentz transformation, to the field source particle rest frame, of the field source particle to test particle null displacement, and the resulting electric field

The Lorentz transformation for a general pure boost is [\cite=jcksn:classelec]

[formula]

The four-position is generally

[formula]

where [formula] is the 3-vector position. The test particle four-position is then

[formula]

The source particle four-position of interest (i.e., at the retarded time and space position of the source particle relative to the test particle position at time t) is then

[formula]

The null four-displacement from the field source particle to the test particle (to represent the field point being at the test particle) is then

[formula]

The field source particle to test particle displacement can be put into components parallel and perpendicular to the test particle velocity [formula] relative to the source particle as

[formula]

The test particle four-position transformed from the inertial laboratory frame to the (inertial, for the non-accelerating) field-source particle rest frame, or source rest frame (srf) is thus

[formula]

with

[formula]

and

[formula]

or

[formula]

The field source particle to test particle separation in the source particle rest frame is thus
