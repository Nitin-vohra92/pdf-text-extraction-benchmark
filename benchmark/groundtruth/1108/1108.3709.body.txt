Introduction.

The possible torsion groups of an elliptic curve over the rational numbers are known by a theorem of Mazur, who actually gave two different proofs of the theorem [\cite=maz1] and [\cite=maz2]. These groups are:

[formula]

[formula]

In a similar manner all the possible torsion groups over the collection of all quadratic fields were determined by Kenku and Momose [\cite=km] and Kamienny [\cite=Kam1]. The author determined the possible torsion groups over the quadratic cyclotomic fields [formula] and [formula] [\cite=Naj1] [\cite=Naj2], which are also the two quadratic fields with the smallest discriminant.

It was proven by Parent [\cite=Par1] [\cite=Par2] that 13 is the largest prime that can divide the order of the torsion of an elliptic curve over a cubic field. Jeon, Kim and Schweizer [\cite=jks] found all the groups that appear as torsion for infinitely many non-isomorphic curves over cubic fields. These are the following groups:

[formula]

[formula]

We denote the set of the above groups as S. Unfortunately, it is not known whether there are other groups that appear as torsion for only finitely many curves. For a cubic field K, we will denote by T(K) the set of all groups that appear as torsion of an elliptic curve over K but are not contained in the set S. Note that the union of all T(K) over all cubic fields is still a finite set, and one could use [\cite=Par3] to give an effective bound. But this bound would be huge and would not be of help for practical purposes.

Since over the rationals and over quadratic fields all the groups that appear as torsion, do so for infinitely many curves, the possibility that T(K) is empty for all cubic fields is not unreasonable.

In this paper we focus more on the torsion of elliptic curves over a single cubic field (as opposed to looking at all cubic fields simultaneously). We deal with three problems:

1) Determine the possible torsion groups of an elliptic curve over the field with smallest discriminant and having Galois group S3 and over the field with smallest discriminant and having Galois group [formula].

2) Find for every group from S the field with the smallest discriminant having it as a torsion of an elliptic curve,

3) Determine for how many non-isomorphic curves does each of the groups from S appear as torsion for any fixed cubic field K.

Note that a similar problem to 1) was solved by the author in [\cite=Naj1] [\cite=Naj2] for quadratic fields. The analogues of 2) and 3) for quadratic fields were dealt with successfully by Kamienny and the author in [\cite=kn].

We succeed in 1) under the assumptions that T(K) is empty for these fields K. We also eliminate some possibilities for T(K).

We succeed in 2) for all the groups except for [formula] and [formula]. The reason we fail for these groups is that the modular curves X1 corresponding to these groups are non-hyperelliptic of genus 3 and 4, and thus it is extremely hard to determine the existence of a cubic point on them.

We solve problem 3) completely. When counting curves throughout this paper, we will always count them up to isomorphisms.

Although we follow the general strategy of [\cite=kn] and [\cite=Naj2] to handle these problems, since the problems are much harder over cubic than over quadratic fields, we will use various other methods, not previously used in [\cite=kn] [\cite=Naj2].

Torsion over cubic fields with smallest discriminant

As we will be mentioning certain cubic fields many times in the remainder of the paper, for the convenience of the reader we list the first seven cubic fields (taken from [\cite=jj]) ordered by ascending absolute value of the discriminant in the table below. In the table, i is the position of the field in the table, Δ the discriminant of the field, G its Galois group (the Galois group of its normal closure, to be precise) and in the last column in the table is the generating polynomial of the field.

Table 1.

We will denote the i-th field in the table as Ki. We will focus on two fields, K1 and K4. The field K1 is the cubic field with the smallest discriminant, while K4 is both the field with smallest discriminant having [formula] as a Galois group and the totally real field with smallest discriminant. Note that both fields have class number 1 and that K4 is the maximal real subfield of the cyclotomic field [formula]. By αi we denote the element generating Ki.

Let K be a number field. Denote by Y1(m,n) the affine modular curve whose K-rational points classify isomorphism classes of triples (E,Pm,Pn), where E is an elliptic curve (over K) and Pm and Pn are torsion points (over K) which generate a subgroup isomorphic to [formula]. For simplicity, we write Y1(n) instead of Y1(1,n). Let X1(m,n) be the compactification of the curve Y1(m,n) obtained by adjoining its cusps.

Similarly, let Y0(N) be the affine curve whose K-rational points classify isomorphism classes of pairs (E,C), where E is an elliptic curve and C is a cyclic [formula]-invariant subgroup of [formula] of order N, or a N-cycle. We obtain X0(N) by adjoining the cusps to Y0(N).

Nice models of the curves X0(n) and X1(n) can be found for example in [\cite=Baa] [\cite=Yang], while the curves X1(2,10) and X1(2,12) can be found in [\cite=Rab].

We will use division polynomials in many places in this paper. For a definition and more information on division polynomials see [\cite=was]. We denote by ψn the n-th division polynomial, which satisfies that, for a point P on an elliptic curve in Weierstrass form, ψn(x(P)) = 0 if and only if nP = 0. Note that for even n one has to work with ψn  /  ψ2 to get a polynomial only in one variable.

We do our rank and torsion computations on elliptic curves and Jacobians of genus 2 curves throughout this paper using MAGMA.

We first prove a useful lemma.

Let K be a number field of odd degree. If [formula], then the rest of the 2-torsion is defined over a quadratic field and hence not over K. So if the 2-Sylow group increases there must be a K-rational (but not [formula]-rational) point P such that 2P = Q, where [formula] is a nontrivial torsion point whose order is a power of 2. But for fixed Q the equation 2P = Q has exactly 4 solutions and it is easy to see that the orbits under the action of [formula] can only have lengths of 2 or 4.

Theorem

First note that by [\cite=jks] there are infinitely many elliptic curves over [formula] with each of the torsion groups from Mazur's theorem.

Let K be a fixed cubic field. Let E be an elliptic curve defined over [formula], such that [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem1], [formula], where n is odd. From [\cite=mr] only finitely many quadratic twists of E(K) have any odd-order torsion and (since twisting does not change the 2-torsion) hence all but finitely many twists will have torsion [formula]. In exactly the same manner one proves that there are infinitely many curves with [formula].

The only groups apart of the ones from Mazur's theorem that can a priori appear as the torsion of infinitely many elliptic curves over K are the ones such that the corresponding modular curve has genus ≤  1 and that they appear on the list in [\cite=jks]. One can see that these are the groups [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula].

Let E be an elliptic curve over [formula] with torsion [formula] or [formula]. Then by Lemma [\ref=lem1], the 2-Sylow subgroups of [formula] and E(K) are equal. Thus the torsion of E(K) is larger than [formula] for only finitely many rational elliptic curves satisfying [formula].

By invoking Lemma [\ref=lem1] when needed, it also follows that there are only finitely many elliptic curves defined over [formula] with torsion [formula], where n = 6,8,9,10 or 12 whose torsion becomes larger in K.

Take E(t) to be the family of rational elliptic curves

[formula]

[formula], with 4-torsion over [formula]. All elliptic curves in this family have good reduction at 5, and [formula] for all [formula]. This shows that [formula] cannot have any 8-torsion, 12-torsion or torsion containing [formula], for all [formula]. As the 3-division polynomial of E(t) is an irreducible degree 4 polynomial (over [formula]), by Hilbert's irreducibility theorem, there are infinitely many t such that E(t)(K) has no 3-torsion. Since by Lemma [\ref=lem1], the 2-Sylow subgroups of [formula] and E(t)(K) are equal, we have proved that there are infinitely many E(t) with torsion group [formula] over K.

Let E(t) be the family of rational elliptic curves

[formula]

[formula], with 5-torsion over [formula]. All elliptic curves in this family have good reduction at 5, and [formula] for all [formula]. This rules out the possibility of 10-torsion in [formula]. If E(t)(K) had any 3-torsion, it would inject into the residue field of (a prime over) 5. But [formula], implying that there is no 3-torsion in the residue field of (a prime over) 5, whatever the splitting behavior of 5 in K. This implies that E(t)(K) has no 15-torsion, for all [formula]. If E(t) is written in short Weierstrass form y2 = x3 + a(t)x + b(t), then the discriminant of x3 + a(t)x + b(t) is a degree 7 polynomial in t. This implies that there are infinitely many values t such that this polynomial generates a totally real cubic field and infinitely many values for which the same polynomial generates a complex cubic field. This now implies that infinitely many E(t) will not have any 2-torsion in K.

A similar argumentation proves that infinitely many rational elliptic curves E with [formula] will have no 2-torsion in K and thus have [formula].

We take the families of elliptic curves with 3-torsion

[formula]

where i = 1 or 2 and t is a non-zero integer. Note that all curves from both families have good reduction at 5, and [formula], and hence [formula] has no 2-torsion or 9-torsion. Thus all curves from these two families have torsion group isomorphic to [formula]. If K is complex, then we choose E2(t) and if K is totally real, we choose E1(t). The discriminant of Ei(t) will then be of opposite sign than the discriminant of K (implying that there is no 2-torsion in Ei(t)(K)). All curves from both families have good reduction at (a prime over) 2, and have either 3 or 9 points in the residue field of (the prime over) 2. This rules out the possibility of 15-torsion in any Ei(t)(K). By factoring the 9-division polynomial of Ei(t) and taking out the factors belonging to the 3-division polynomial, we are left with factors of degree larger than 9 (as polynomials over [formula]). This means that, by Hilbert's irreducibility theorem, for infinitely many values t, there will be no 9-torsion in Ei(t)(K).

Let E(t) be the family of rational elliptic curves with

[formula]

where [formula], containing [formula] as a torsion subgroup over [formula]. All curves in the family have good reduction at 5, and all curves have 8 points in [formula]. This proves that none of the curves have torsion [formula] and that [formula] is the whole torsion group over [formula]. The 3-division polynomial is irreducible (over [formula]) and by Hilbert's irreducibility theorem, there are infinitely many curves E(t) that have no 3-torsion over any cubic field. Finally, after applying Lemma [\ref=lem1], we have proved that there are infinitely many curves with torsion [formula] over K.

As we have already proved that there are infinitely many elliptic curves with odd torsion over K, from [\cite=mr] we conclude that each of these curves has a twist with trivial torsion. Thus there are infinitely many elliptic curves with trivial torsion over K.

Theorem

By Theorem [\ref=lem3], all the torsion groups from Mazur's theorem appear infinitely often over K1.

The modular curve X1(11) is an elliptic curve with an affine model y2  -  y  =  x3  -  x2. We compute that X1(11)(K1) has rank 0 and [formula], so all the points X1(11)(K1) correspond to cusps, implying the non-existence of an elliptic curve with 11-torsion over K1.

The modular curve X1(14) is an elliptic curve with an affine model y2 + xy + y  =  x3  -  x. We compute that X1(14)(K1) has rank 0 and [formula], so all the points X1(11)(K1) correspond to cusps, implying the non-existence of an elliptic curve with 14-torsion over K1.

The modular curve X1(15) is an elliptic curve with an affine model y2 + xy + y  =  x3 + x2. We compute that [formula], the points on X1(15)(K1) again being cusps, thus proving the non-existence of 15-torsion over K1.

The modular curve X1(2,10) is an elliptic curve with an affine model y2 = x3 + x2 - x. We compute that [formula], the points on X1(2,10)(K1) being cusps, implying that there does not exist an elliptic curve with torsion [formula] over K1.

The modular curve X1(2,12) is an elliptic curve with an affine model y2 = x3 - x2 + x. We compute [formula], where (2α21  -  1,2α21  -  2α1  -  3) is an element of infinite order. Since each point on X1(2,12)(K1) corresponds to an isomorphism class of elliptic curves with torsion [formula] over K1, it is easy to see that there are infinitely many curves with this torsion.

The modular curve X1(13) is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 having an affine model y2 = x6 - 2x5 + x4 - 2x3 + 6x2 - 4x + 1. Denote by J1(N) the Jacobian of X1(N). We embed the curve into its Jacobian J1(13)(K1), and compute that [formula]. The rank of the Jacobian can be computed in MAGMA, while for the computation of the torsion, we use the MAGMA code of S. Siksek that can be found at (although we could manage to compute the torsion by examining the Jacobian over finite fields, as in [\cite=Naj2]). We then proceed to compute the fiber of the map X1(13)(K1)  →  J1(13)(K1) and thus find that all the points on X1(13)(K1) are cusps.

The modular curve X1(16) is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 having an affine model y2 = x5  +  2x4  +  2x2  -  x. In a similar way as above we compute [formula], and find that all the points on X1(16)(K1) are cusps.

The modular curve X1(18) is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 having an affine model y2 = x6 + 2x5 + 5x4 + 10x3 + 10x2 + 4x + 1. In a similar way as above we compute [formula], and find that all points on X1(18)(K1) are cusps.

As there is no 14-torsion over K1, there obviously does not exist a curve with torsion [formula].

It remains to prove that there is no 20-torsion. As we mentioned in the introduction, the methods used above are hard to use on X1(20) as it is a non-hyperelliptic curve of genus 3. We will instead work with X0(20), and prove a stronger statement, i.e. that there is no 20-cycle over K1. The modular curve X0(20) is an elliptic curve with an affine model y2 = (x + 1)(x2 + 4) (see [\cite=Yang]), and we compute [formula]. It is known (see [\cite=ogg]) that X0(4p) has 6 rational cusps when p is a prime, so we conclude that all the points on X0(20)(K1) are cusps.

In general, for any cubic field K, it is known that there are no points of order 55 [\cite=km], 27 or 64 [\cite=mom] over K.

Remark 1. One could also easily prove that there is also no 21-torsion over K1 in a similar same way as it was proven that there is no 20-torsion. One finds that [formula], having 4 noncuspidal points, corresponding to the 4 rational curves having a 21-cycle, and none of them having 21-torsion. Unfortunately, this is all we can say about T(K1).

Theorem

We first compute in a similar manner as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=t1] that Y1(11)(K4) is empty.

Next we find that the rank of X1(14)(K4) is 0 and the torsion is [formula]. These 18 points comprise all the cusps of X1(14) (6 rational over [formula] and 6 rational over K4), and the 6 noncuspidal points generate exactly two curves (if P is a point of order 14 on E, then (E,  ±  P), (E,  ±  3P) and (E,  ±  5P) are three distinct points on X1(14) corresponding to the same curve E), which are

[formula]

and

[formula]

both with the 14-torsion point (0,0). The curves ([\ref=14t]) and ([\ref=14t2]) have j-invariants 2553 and - 153 respectively, and both are CM curves. Note that X1(14) is itself an elliptic curve, so we have simultaneously proved that there also exists an elliptic curve with 18-torsion over K4! As the curves above are the only ones with 14-torsion, by checking that they do not have another 2-torsion point, we prove that there are no curves over K4 with torsion [formula]. Both curves have rank 0, so over K4 there are no elliptic curves having [formula] as a subgroup.

One finds in exactly the same way as in Theorem [\ref=t1] that there are no elliptic curves over K4 with torsion subgroups [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula].

As X1(4N) is a cover of X1(2,2N), and [formula], one sees that [formula].

We find noncuspidal points on X1(13) and construct from one of them the curve (which has rational j-invariant)

[formula]

with the point (0,0) of order 13.

Note that since X1(13) and X1(18) are curves of genus 2, by Faltings' theorem there are only finitely many points on them over K4 and hence only finitely many elliptic curves with 13-torsion and 18-torsion.

We can say more about T(K4) than we did for T(K1).

Proposition

One proves the non-existence of 21-torsion exactly the same way as over K1. The non-existence of 24-torsion follows from [formula].

As proven in Theorem [\ref=t2], there are only two curves having [formula] as a subgroup, and one easily checks that neither of them contains [formula].

The non-existence of N-torsion for N = 32,36 and 49 is proven by showing that the elliptic curve X0(N) has rank 0 and checking that all the torsion points are actually cusps. For all the curves except X0(32), MAGMA easily computes the rank using 2-descent. For X0(32) it only gives an upper bound of 2. However we can compute that the analytic rank is equal to 0, and since K4 is a totally real field of odd degree, [\cite=zha] implies that the algebraic rank is also equal to 0.

Since X0(35) is a genus 3 (hyperelliptic) curve, it is better not to work with X0(35) directly. Instead, we can redo the proof of Kubert [\cite=kub] over K4. We work with X0(35) / w5, where w5 is an Atkin-Lehner involution. There is a nice model of X0(35) / w5:

[formula]

We compute that [formula], and as already shown in [\cite=kub], these 3 points come from cusps of X0(35), thus proving that there is no 35-cycle over K4.

By [\cite=bcdt] for a rational elliptic curve E of conductor N there exists a morphism

[formula]

called modular parametrization. To eliminate [formula] and [formula] we more or less follow the strategy of the proof of [\cite=jm]. We easily compute that for the elliptic curve

[formula]

with conductor 52 it holds [formula] and that the degree of the modular parametrization is 3. Thus there are at most 6 points on X0(52)(K4), but (see [\cite=ogg]) X0(52) has 6 rational cusps, so [formula], implying [formula].

Remark 2. One can prove that if [formula], then [formula] in the following way. First, one uses the same methods as in the proofs of Theorems [\ref=t1] and [\ref=t2] to prove that there are no elliptic curves with points of order 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 and that no curve contains [formula] as a subgroup. We find that there are infinitely many curves containing [formula] and are unfortunately unable to determine whether there exists a curve with 20-torsion. The non-existence of an elliptic curve having a point of order 21, 24, 35 or 49 is proved in exactly the same way as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=t3]. Finally, we use the modular parametrization (of degree 4) X0(40)  →  E, where E is the elliptic curve y2 = x3 - 107x - 426 with [formula], to prove the non-existence of a 40-cycle, ruling out [formula] and [formula] as possible subgroups. Note that all other non-cyclic torsion groups are ruled out by the Weil pairing.

For any cubic field K it seems hardest to rule out the existence of 25-torsion in T(K), as X0(25) has genus 0 (and infinitely many points) and X1(25) has genus 12. There is an intermediate curve B

[formula]

(where the numbers above the arrows denote the degrees of the maps), which was used by Kubert [\cite=kub] to prove the non-existence of rational 25-torsion and by Kenku [\cite=ken] to show that there is no 25-torsion over quadratic fields. However this is still a curve of genus 4, and is thus not suited for the methods used in this paper.

Cubic fields with smallest discriminant with a given torsion group appearing over them

In this section we will find, for a given group [formula] the cubic field K with smallest absolute value of its discriminant such that G appears as torsion of some elliptic curve E(K). We will follow the same general strategy as Kamienny and the author [\cite=kn], by examining fields by ascending |Δ(K)| and for each field either finding an elliptic curve with given torsion or proving the non-existence of such a curve. For a group G∈S, we denote that field by M(G).

Proposition

This follows directly from Theorem [\ref=t1].

Proposition

From Theorem [\ref=t1], we see that [formula] and [formula] do not appear as torsion groups over K1. We compute rank(X1(14)(K2)) = 1, and find the elliptic curve

[formula]

with the point (0,0) having order 14.

In a similar way we compute rank(X1(2,10)(K2)) = 1 and find an elliptic curve with torsion [formula], for example

[formula]

Proposition

One easily computes that [formula] has only cusps for i = 1,2 and [formula] (the rank of X1(11) is 0 over K3). We obtain that there is exactly one (up to isomorphism) elliptic curve with 11-torsion over K3, this curve being

[formula]

Note that this curve has rank 0.

One can compute that [formula] for i = 1,2 and that the rank of X1(15)(K3) is 1. We find an elliptic curve

[formula]

with 15-torsion.

We compute that rank(J1(13)) = 0 over the fields with smaller discriminant. Then it is easy to check that there are no elliptic curves with 13-torsion over those fields. Over K3 we find that J1(13) has positive rank, and by a simple search we find points on Y1(13), obtaining the elliptic curve

[formula]

Proposition

One computes that the rank of the J1(18)(Ki) is 0 and [formula] for i < 4. In Theorem [\ref=t2], it was already proved that 18-torsion appears over K4.

Proposition

This is proved exactly as the previous proposition. We give a curve with 16-torsion over K5:

[formula]

Proposition

One finds an elliptic curve with 20-torsion over K40, the 40-th field in the table [\cite=jj], generated by the polynomial x3  -  x2  -  4x  +  2 by putting t = 2 into [\cite=jky]. Note that the polynomials 4x3 + 8x2 + x - 2 obtained from [\cite=jky] and x3  -  x2  -  4x  +  2 (from [\cite=jj]) differ but they generate the same field. The field K40 is a S3 cubic field.

We find an elliptic curve with torsion [formula] over K143, the 143-th field from [\cite=jj], generated by x3  -  x2  -  10x  +  8, using [\cite=jky]. The polynomials from [\cite=jj] and [\cite=jky] differ, but they generate the same field. The field K143 is a cyclic cubic field.

The number of elliptic curves with given torsion over a number field

In this section we examine the number (up to isomorphism) of elliptic curves over cubic number fields. We will ignore the groups that appear as torsion already over [formula] as by Theorem [\ref=lem3] they appear as torsion over every cubic field infinitely many times.

The same problem (again ignoring the groups from Mazur's theorem) for quadratic fields was dealt with in [\cite=kn]. It was shown that for some groups, if there is one curve with given torsion there are infinitely many, for some groups there are always finitely many, while for some groups, over some quadratic fields there will be finitely many, and over others infinitely many.

We obtain the following result for cubic fields.

Theorem

a) Since all the modular curves parameterizing these torsions are of genus ≥  2, the result follows trivially from Faltings' theorem. Actually, the statement is true over a number field of any degree.

b) The only way it is possible that there is a finite number of curves with a torsion group parameterized by a modular curve X1 of genus 1 is that over some cubic field the torsion of X1(K) is larger than [formula] and that rank(X1(K)) = 0. We can find the possible candidates for this by examining the division polynomials of X1.

By [\cite=Par1] [\cite=Par2] the only primes that can divide the order of the torsion are the primes up to and including 13.

We start with X1(15). Note that [formula]. We easily compute that ψn(X1(15)) for n = 3,5,7,11,13 are all irreducible of degree larger than 3, and hence ψn(X1(15)) will not have a root over any cubic field. By Lemma [\ref=lem1] the 2-Sylow subgroups of [formula] and X1(15)(K) are equal for all cubic fields K.

We compute [formula] and ψn(X1(2,10)) for n = 5,7,11,13 are all irreducible of degree larger than 3, and hence ψn(X1(2,10)) will not have a root over any cubic field. By Lemma [\ref=lem1] there are no additional cubic points of order 2n. The polynomial ψ9(X1(2,10)) factors as (x - 1)(x3  +  7 / 3x2  +  1 / 3x  +  1 / 3)f9f27, where f9 and f27 are irreducible polynomials of degree 9 and 27. The points with x = 1 correspond to the rational points of order 3. We see that there is a factor of degree 3 in the factorization implying that the x-coordinate of an additional element of order dividing 9 satisfies x3  +  7 / 3x2  +  1 / 3x  +  1 / 3. We examine [formula] where α is the root of x3  +  7 / 3x2  +  1 / 3x  +  1 / 3. We check that the torsion of [formula] is still [formula]. This is because the y-coordinate of the point corresponding to this polynomial is not defined over [formula]. It is in fact defined over [formula], over which X1(2,10) has torsion [formula]. We conclude that there are no noncuspidal cubic torsion points on X1(2,10) that are not defined over [formula].

We compute [formula] and ψn(X1(2,12)) for n = 3,5,7,11,13 are all irreducible of degree larger than 3, and hence ψn(X1(2,12)) will not have a root over any cubic field. By Lemma [\ref=lem1] there are no cubic points of even order apart from the ones defined over [formula].

c) From the short Weierstrass form we see that K3 is the only cubic field over which X1(11) has a 2-torsion point. Over any other cubic field, X1 has odd torsion. As X1(11) has good reduction at (a prime over) 2, its whole torsion subgroup embeds into the residue field of (a prime over) 2. By the Hasse-Weil bound, an elliptic curve can have at most 13 points over that field, so only [formula] is possible.

d) We compute [formula] and ψn(X1(14)) for n = 5,7,11,13 are all irreducible of degree larger than 3, and hence ψn(X1(14)) will not have a root over any cubic field. By Lemma [\ref=lem1] there are no additional cubic 2n-torsion points. The polynomial ψ9(X1(14)) factors as x(x3  -  2x2  -  x  +  1)(x3  +  x2 / 3  -  x  +  1)f6f27, where f6 and f27 are irreducible polynomials of degree 6 and 27. Note that the first polynomial generates K4 and, as shown in Theorem [\ref=t2], [formula] and the additional torsion generates just the curves ([\ref=14t]) and ([\ref=14t2]). Let K be the field generated by x3  +  x2 / 3  -  x  +  1. We check that although the x-coordinate of additional torsion points is defined over K, the y-coordinate is not. Actually, the situation is similar to X1(2,10), i.e. [formula].

e) We use the proof of [\cite=jks], where it is proved that if an elliptic curve E is written in the form Y2 = X3 + Ax + B, [formula], then one can construct an infinite sequence of primes pi such that the roots ξi of X3 + Ax + B - p- 20i generate distinct cubic fields [formula], such that [formula] has positive rank. For the modular curve X1(2,10), the discriminant of X3 + Ax + B is positive, so for all but finitely many pi, the discriminant of X3 + Ax + B - p- 20i will also be positive. Hence X1(2,10) will have positive rank over infinitely many totally real cubic fields. On the other hand, for the remaining modular curves of genus 1, the discriminant of X3 + Ax + B is negative, implying that for all but finitely many pi, the discriminant of X3 + Ax + B - p- 20i will also be negative. Hence these modular curves will have positive rank over infinitely many cubic fields with Galois group S3.
