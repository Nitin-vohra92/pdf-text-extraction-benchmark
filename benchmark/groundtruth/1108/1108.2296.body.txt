DISCRETE QUANTUM GRAVITY

Introduction

This paper explores the causal set approach to discrete quantum gravity [\cite=blms87] [\cite=bdghs03] [\cite=hen09]. There are many good review articles on this subject [\cite=hen06] [\cite=sor03] [\cite=sur11] and we refer the reader to these works for more details and motivation. The origins of this approach stem from studies of the causal structure (M, < ) of a Lorentzian spacetime (M,g). For a,b∈M we write a < b if b is in the causal future of a. If there are no closed causal curves in (M,g), then (M, < ) is a partially ordered set (poset). That is, the order <   satisfies: It has been shown that (M, < ) possesses much of the information contained in (M,g) [\cite=bms89] [\cite=mal77] [\cite=mp04] [\cite=zee64]. In fact, (M, < ) determines the topological and even the differential structure of the manifold (M,g). Moreover, (M, < ) can be employed to find the length of line elements and the dimension of (M,g). Finally, counting arguments on (M, < ) can be employed to find volume elements in (M,g). Because of these properties, it is believed that the order structure (M, < ) provides a viable candidate for describing a discrete quantum gravity.

For a poset (A, < ), the past of b∈A is [formula]. We say that [formula] is past finite if the past of b has finite cardinality for every b∈A. A causal set is a past finite countable poset. One of the simplifications of this paper is that the relevant posets considered will be finite so they are automatically causal sets. Another simplification is that we shall only consider unlabeled posets. In the literature, causal sets are usually labeled according to the order of "birth" and this causes complications because covariant properties are independent of labeling [\cite=blms87] [\cite=bdghs03] [\cite=rs00] [\cite=sor03]. In this way our causal sets are automatically covariant.

Section 2 describes a classical sequential growth process in which the universe grows one element at a time in discrete steps. At each step the process has the form of a causal set and the "completed" universe is given by a path through a discretely growing chain of causal sets. The transition probability at each step is given by an expression due to Rideout-Sorkin [\cite=rs00] [\cite=vr06]. Letting Ω be the set of paths, A be the σ-algebra generated by cylinder sets and ν the probability measure governed by the transition probabilities, the dynamics is described by a Markov chain on the probability space (Ω,A,ν).

In Section 3 we quantize classical frameworks by forming the Hilbert space H = L2(Ω,A,ν). The quantum dynamics is given by a sequence of states ρn on H that satisfy a consistency condition. We employ ρn to construct decoherence functionals and a quantum measure μ on a "quadratic algebra" S of subsets of Ω. In general, the set S is strictly between the collection of cylinder sets and A. We then present (Ω,S,μ) as a candidate model for quantum gravity. We also give a method for quantizing random variables in the classical process to obtain observables in the corresponding quantum process. This quantization is then used to define a quantum integral.

The sequence of states ρn discussed in Section 3 is called a quantum sequential growth process. Section 4 shows that a discrete isometric process can be employed to construct a quantum sequential growth process. This work is related to the "sum over histories" approach to quantum mechanics [\cite=hen06].

Of course, much work remains to be done. Of primary importance is to find the specific form of the classical measure ν and the quantum measure μ. One guiding principle is that classical general relativity theory should be a "good approximation" to this quantum counterpart.

Quantum Sequential Growth Processes

Let Pn be the collection of all posets of cardinality n, [formula], and let [formula] be the collection of all finite posets. An element a∈x for x∈P is maximal if there is no b∈x with a < b. If x∈Pn, y∈Pn + 1, then x produces y if y is obtained from x by adjoining a single maximal element to x. We also say that x is a producer of y and y is an offspring of x. If x produces y we write x  →  y. Of course, x may produce many offspring and a poset may be the offspring of many producers. Also, x may produce y in various isomorphic ways. For example, in Figure 1 we have that x produces u,v,w. In this paper we identify isomorphic copies of a poset so we identify u,v,w and say that the multiplicity of x  →  u is three and write m(x  →  u) = 3. (Strictly speaking, the multiplicity requires a labeling of the elements of a poset and this is the only place that labeling needs to be mentioned.) In Figure 1, notice that within each circle is a Hasse diagram of a poset and a rising line in a diagram represents a link.

The transitive closure of [formula] makes P into a poset itself. A path in P is a sequence (string) [formula] where xi∈Pi and xi  →  xi + 1, [formula]. An n-path in P is a finite string [formula] where again xi∈Pi and xi  →  xi + 1. We denote the set of paths by Ω and the set of n-paths by Ωn. If a,b∈x with x∈P, we say that a is an ancestor of b and b is a successor of a if a < b. We say that a is a parent of b and b is a child of a if a < b and there is no c with a < c < b. A link in a Hasse diagram represents a parent-child relationship.

Let [formula] be a sequence of nonnegative numbers (called coupling constants [\cite=rs00] [\cite=sor03]). For [formula] with r  ≤  s, define For x∈Pn, y∈Pn + 1 with x  →  y we define the transition probability

[formula]

where α is the number of ancestors and π the number of parents of the adjoined maximal element to x that produces y. The definition of pt(x  →  y) originally appears in [\cite=rs00]. It is shown there that pt(x  →  y) is a probability distribution in that it satisfies the Markov-sum rule The distribution y  ↦  Pt(x,y) is essentially the most general that is consistent with principles of causality and covariance [\cite=rs00] [\cite=sor03]. It is hoped that other theoretical principles or experimental data will determine the coupling constants. One suggestion is to take tk = 1 / k! [\cite=sor03].

As an illustration, which probably will not work for quantum gravity and cosmology, let tk = tk for some t > 0. This case has been previously studied and is called a percolation dynamics [\cite=hen06] [\cite=sor03]. For this choice we have and as a special case λt(n,0) = (1 + t)n. Letting β be the number of elements of x not related to the adjoined maximal element, by [\eqref=eq21] we have Letting r = t(1 + t)- 1 we have that 1 - r = (1 + t)- 1 and we obtain the more familiar form pt(x  →  y) = m(x  →  y)rπ(1 - r)β

We call an element x∈P a site and view a site x∈Pn as a possible universe at step n while a path may be viewed as a possible (evolved) universe. The set P together with the set of transition probabilities pt(x  →  y) forms a classical sequential growth process (CSGP) which we denote by (P,pt) [\cite=rs00] [\cite=vr06]. It is clear that (P,pt) is a Markov chain. (In traditional Markov chains, sites are called states but we reserve that term for quantum states to be used later.) As with any Markov chain, the probability of an n-path [formula] is and the probability of a site x∈Pn is Of course, ω  ↦  pnt(ω) is a probability measure on Ωn.

From Table 1 and [\eqref=eq21] we obtain the transition probabilities given in Table 2 where s0 = t0 + t1, s1 = t0 + 2t1 + t2 3pc

Finally, Table 3 lists the probabilities of the various sites, where s2 = s0s1 and p0t(x0) = 1 by convention. 3pc

We now compute the transition probabilities.

[formula]

Letting An be the power set 2Ωn we have that An is an algebra of subsets of Ωn and (Ωn,An,pnt) is a probability space. Now we can consider Ωn to be the product space [formula] and Ω to be the product space [formula]. (Strictly speaking Ωn is a subset of [formula] because all elements of the latter set do not correspond to n-paths. However, we can define and adjoining sets of measure zero is harmless. The same remark holds for Ω and for cylinder sets to be discussed next.) A subset C  ⊆  Ω is a cylinder set if

[formula]

for some C1∈An. In particular, if ω∈Ωn, then the elementary cylinder set [formula] is defined by It is easy to check that the collection of cylinder sets C(Ω) forms an algebra of subsets of Ω. Moreover, for C∈C(Ω) of the form [\eqref=eq22] we define pt(C) = pnt(C1). Then pt is a well-defined probability measure on the algebra C(Ω). It follows from the Kolmogorov extension theorem that pt has a unique extension to a probability measure νt on the σ-algebra A generated by C(Ω). We conclude that (Ω,A,νt) is a probability space. We can identify An with the algebra of cylinder sets of the form [\eqref=eq22] to obtain an increasing sequence of subalgebras [formula] of A that generate A. Also, the restriction νt|An = pnt.

Quantum Sequential Growth Processes

In Section 2 we described a general CSPG (P,pt). We now show how to "quantize" (P,pt) to obtain a quantum sequential growth process (QSGP). It is hoped that this formalism can be employed to construct a model for discrete quantum gravity. At the end of Section 2 we formed a path probability space (Ω,A,νt) which we interpret as a space of potential universes. Let H = L2(Ω,A,νt) be the path Hilbert space. We previously observed that An considered as an algebra of cylinder sets is a subalgebra of A and νt|An = pnt. We conclude that the n-path Hilbert spaces Hn = L2(Ω,An,pnt) form an increasing sequence [formula] of closed subspaces of H. Assuming that pnt(ω)  ≠  0 for every ω∈Ωn we have that [formula] and that forms an orthonormal basis for Hn.

Let ρ be a state (density operator) on Hn. We can and shall assume that ρ is also a state on H by defining ρf = 0 for all [formula]. If A∈An then the characteristic function χA∈H and [formula]. We define the decoherence functional [formula] by It can be shown [\cite=gud111] that Dρ has the usual properties of a decoherence functional. Namely, [formula], A  ↦  Dρ(A,B) is a complex measure on An and if Ai∈An, [formula], then the r  ×  r matrix with components Dρ(Ai,Aj) is positive semidefinite. We also define the q-measure [formula] by μρ(A) = Dρ(A,A). In general, μρ is not additive so μρ is not a measure on An. However, μρ is grade-2 additive [\cite=gt09] [\cite=gud09] [\cite=sor94] [\cite=sor07] in the sense that if A,B,C∈An are mutually disjoint then

[formula]

A subset Q  ⊆  A is a quadratic algebra if [formula] and if A,B,C∈Q are mutually disjoint with [formula], then [formula]. A q-measure on a quadratic algebra Q is a map [formula] satisfying [\eqref=eq31] whenever A,B,C∈Q are mutually disjoint with [formula]. In particular An is a quadratic algebra and [formula] is a q-measure in this sense.

Let ρn be a state on Hn, [formula], which can be viewed as a state on H. We say that the sequence ρn is consistent if for every A∈An. We call a consistent sequence ρn a discrete quantum process and we call the ρn the local states for the process. If lim ρn  =  ρ exists in the strong operator topology, we call ρ the global state for the process. If the global state ρ exists, then μρ is a (continuous) q-measure on A that extends μρn, [formula]. Unfortunately the global state does not exist, in general, so we must work with the local states [\cite=gud112] [\cite=gsapp] [\cite=sor11]. We contend that there is a discrete quantum process ρn on the path Hilbert space H that describes the dynamics for a discrete quantum gravity. As with the probability measures pnt, theoretical principles or experimental data will be required to give restrictions on the possible ρn. We shall consider one possibility shortly.

Let ρn be a discrete quantum process on H = L2(Ω,A,νt). If C∈C(Ω) has the form [\eqref=eq22] we define μ(C) = μρn(C1). It is easy to check that μ is well-defined and gives a q-measure on algebra C(Ω). In general, μ cannot be extended to a q-measure on A, but it is important to extend μ to other physically relevant sets [\cite=gud112] [\cite=mocs05] [\cite=sor11]. We say that a set A∈A is suitable if [formula] exists and is finite and if this is the case we define [formula] to be the limit. We denote the collection of suitable sets by S(Ω). The proof of the next theorem is similar to a proof given in [\cite=gud112].

S(Ω) is a quadratic algebra and [formula] is a q-measure on S(Ω) that extends μ from C(Ω).

We call a real-valued function f∈H a random variable (Actually, we are considering random variables with finite second moment but this restriction is convenient here.) We now give a method for "quantizing" f to obtain a bounded self-adjoint operator (observable) [formula] on H. Although we employ [formula] to define a quantum integral of f, there may be another important use for [formula]. The map f  ↦   transforms classical observables to quantum observables. If a discrete quantum process ρn governs the dynamics for a discrete quantum gravity, then in some sense, Einstein's field equation should be an approximation to the sequence ρn which gives a strong restriction on ρn. In this respect, the map f  ↦   may be useful in transforming the observables of classical relativity to quantum relativity.

The quantization of a nonnegative random variable f is the operator [formula] on H defined by It easily follows that [formula] so [formula] is a bounded self-adjoint operator on H. If f is an arbitrary random variable, we have that f = f+ - f- where [formula] and [formula]. We define the bounded self-adjoint operator [formula] on H by [formula]. It can be shown that [formula] [\cite=gud112]. The next result summarizes some of the important properties of [formula] [\cite=gud112].

(a) For every A∈A, [formula]. (b) For every [formula], [formula]. (c) If f  ≥  0, then [formula] is a positive operator. (d) If [formula] is an increasing sequence of random variables converging in norm to a random variable f, then i  →   in the operator norm topology. (e) If f,g,h are random variables with disjoint supports, then

Let ρ be a state on H and let μρ be the corresponding q-measure on An or A. If f is a random variable, we define the q-integral (or q-expectation) of f with respect to μρ as The next corollary follows from Theorem [\ref=thm32]

(a) For every A∈A, [formula]. (b) For every [formula], [formula]. (c) If f  ≥  0, then [formula]. (d) If fi  ≥  0 is an increasing sequence of random variables converging in norm to a random variable f, then [formula]. (e) If f,g,h are random variables with disjoint supports, then

[formula]

The next result is called the tail-sum formula and gives a justification for calling [formula] a q-integral [\cite=gud09] [\cite=gud111].

If f  ≥  0 is a random variable, then where dλ denotes Lebesgue measure on [formula].

It follows from Theorem [\ref=thm34] that if f is an arbitrary random variable, then

Let ρn be a discrete quantum process on H. We say that a random variable f is integrable for ρn if [formula] exists and is finite and in this case we define [formula] to be this limit. Notice that if A∈S(Ω), then χA is integrable and [formula]. The next result follows from Corollary [\ref=cor33].

(a) If f is integrable and [formula], then αf is integrable and [formula]. (b) If f is integrable with f  ≥  0, then [formula]. (c) If f,g,h are integrable with mutually disjoint supports and f + g, f + h, g + h are integrable, then f + g + h is integrable and

[formula]

Discrete Isometric Processes

Section 3 discussed a quantum gravity model in terms of a discrete quantum process ρn, [formula], on H = L2(Ω,A,νt). It may be that ρn is determined by a system of isometries (there is some controversy about whether this is possible [\cite=sor03]). This would provide a restriction on the possible ρn. Moreover, we are familiar with dynamics governed by isometries so this might aid our intuition. The reader should note that such a formalism is motivated by and related to the sum over histories approach to quantum mechanics. The results in this section are similar to results in [\cite=gud112] taken in a different context.

Let Kn be the Hilbert space of complex-valued function on Pn with the usual inner product We call Kn the n-site Hilbert space and we denote the standard basis [formula], x∈Pn, of Kn by enx. The projection operator [formula], x∈Pn, describe the site at step n. In our context, a discrete isometric system is a collection of isometries U(s,r), [formula], such that U(s,r):Kr  →  Ks, U(r,r) = Ir and U(t,r) = U(t,s)U(s,r) for every [formula]. Recall that U(s,r) is an isometry means that U(s,r) is an operator satisfying U(s,r)*U(s,r) = Ir and U(s,r)U(s,r)* = Ps where Ir is the identity on Kr and Ps is the projection onto the range of U(s,r) in Ks.

Let U(s,r), [formula] be a discrete isometric system and let ω∈Ωn be an n-path. Since all n-paths go through x1 of Figure 1 we can and shall assume that all n-paths begin at x1. Then ω has the form [formula], ωi∈Pi, [formula]. We describe ω by the operator Cn(ω):K1  →  Kn given by

[formula]

Defining a(ω) by

[formula]

[\eqref=eq41] becomes

[formula]

Of course, we can identify K1 with [formula] so Cn(ω) is the operator given by [formula] for every [formula]. We call a(ω) the amplitude of ω∈Ωn and interpret [formula] as the probability of the path ω according to the dynamics U(s,r). The next result shows that [formula] is indeed a probability distribution.

For the n-path space Ωn we have

By [\eqref=eq42] we have

[formula]

The quantity Cn(ω')*Cn(ω) describes the interference between the two paths ω,ω'∈Ωn. Applying [\eqref=eq43] we see that

[formula]

which we can identify with the complex number [formula]. For A∈An the class operator Cn(A) is It is clear that A  ↦  Cn(A) is an operator-valued measure on the algebra An. Moreover, Cn(Ωn) = U(n,1) because by [\eqref=eq42] and [\eqref=eq43] we have

[formula]

It is well-known that [formula] defined by is a decoherence functional and we see that Dn(Ωn,Ωn) = 1. Defining the q-measure [formula] by μn(A) = Dn(A,A), we have that μn(Ωn) = 1.

The n-distribution on Pn given by is interpreted as the probability that site x is visited at step n. The next result shows that pn gives the usual quantum distribution.

For x∈Pn we have

Letting [formula] we have by [\eqref=eq44] that

[formula]

By [\eqref=eq42] we have that and the result follows.

We define the decoherence matrix as the matrix n with components ω,ω'∈Ωn. We have by [\eqref=eq44] that

[formula]

Notice that [formula] and by Lemma [\ref=lem41] that [formula]. Finally, notice that

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Define the Hilbert space H'n as the set of complex-valued functions on Ωn with the usual inner product Then n corresponds to the operator (also denoted by n) given by

The operator n is a state on H'n.

It follows from [\eqref=eq45] that n is a positive operator [\cite=gsapp] [\cite=mocs05]. By Lemma [\ref=lem41] we have Hence, n is a trace 1 positive operator so n is a state on H'n.

Each ω∈Ωn corresponds to a unit vector [formula] in H'n and for every A∈An we have the vector [formula].

The decoherence functional satisfies

For every A,∈An we have

[formula]

We now transfer the states n on H'n to states on Hn, [formula]. The set [formula] forms an orthonormal basis for H'n and assuming that [formula] for all ω∈Ωn, we have that [formula] is an orthonormal basis for Hn where Defining [formula] and extending Un by linearity, Un:H'n  →  Hn becomes a unitary operator and Un:H'n  →  H is an isometry from H'n into H. Letting Pn be the projection of H onto the subspace Hn we have In particular, for A∈A we obtain Hence, To transfer n from H'n to Hn we define ρn = UnnU*nPn. Then ρn is a state on Hn and also on H as before.

The sequence of states ρn, [formula], is consistent.

To show that ρn is consistent is equivalent to showing that

[formula]

for all A,B∈An. Using the notation [formula] for ω∈Ωn and x∈Pn + 1, [\eqref=eq47] is equivalent to for every ω,ω'∈Ωn. Since it follows that for all ω,ω'∈Ωn. Hence

[formula]

We conclude from Theorem [\ref=thm45] that ρn is a discrete quantum process on H = L2(Ω,A,νt) that was constructed from a discrete isometric process.
