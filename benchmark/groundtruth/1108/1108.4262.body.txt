Introduction

A (Euclidean) lattice [formula] in dimension n is unimodular if L  =  L*, where the dual lattice L* of L is defined as [formula] under the standard inner product (x,y). A unimodular lattice is called even if the norm (x,x) of every vector x is even. A unimodular lattice which is not even is called odd. An even unimodular lattice in dimension n exists if and only if [formula], while an odd unimodular lattice exists for every dimension. Two lattices L and L' are neighbors if both lattices contain a sublattice of index 2 in common.

Rains and Sloane [\cite=RS-bound] showed that the minimum norm min (L) of a unimodular lattice L in dimension n is bounded by min (L)  ≤  2⌊n / 24⌋ + 2 unless n = 23 when min (L)  ≤  3. We say that a unimodular lattice meeting the upper bound is extremal. Gaulter [\cite=Gaulter] showed that any unimodular lattice in dimension 24k meeting the upper bound has to be even, which was conjectured by Rains and Sloane. Hence, an odd unimodular lattice L in dimension 24k satisfies min (L)  ≤  2k + 1. We say that an odd unimodular lattice L in dimension 24k with min (L) = 2k + 1 is optimal.

Shadows of odd unimodular lattices appeared in [\cite=CS90-AMS] and [\cite=CS-odd], and shadows play an important role in the study of odd unimodular lattices. For example, shadows are the main tool in [\cite=RS-bound]. Let L be an odd unimodular lattice and let L0 be the subset of vectors of even norm. Then L0 is a sublattice of L of index 2. The shadow of L is defined as [formula]. We define the shadow minimum of L as [formula].

The aim of this note is to show the following:

If there is an extremal even unimodular lattice Λ in dimension 72, then there is an optimal odd unimodular lattice L in dimension 72 with [formula], which is a neighbor of Λ.

Recently Nebe [\cite=Nebe72] has found an extremal even unimodular lattice in dimension 72. It was a long-standing question to determine the existence of such a lattice. As a consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm:main], we have the following:

There is an optimal odd unimodular lattice L in dimension 72 with [formula].

An optimal odd unimodular lattice in dimension 72

The theta series θL(q) of a lattice L is the formal power series [formula]. Conway and Sloane [\cite=CS90-AMS] [\cite=CS-odd] showed that when the theta series of an odd unimodular lattice L in dimension n is written as

[formula]

the theta series of the shadow S(L) is written as

[formula]

where [formula] and θ2(q),θ3(q) and θ4(q) are the Jacobi theta series [\cite=SPLAG]. As the additional conditions, it follows from [\cite=CS90-AMS] and [\cite=CS-odd] that

[formula]

Let L be an optimal odd unimodular lattice in dimension 72 with [formula]. Then the theta series of L and S(L) are uniquely determined as

[formula]

respectively.

In ([\ref=eq:CS1]) and ([\ref=eq:CS2]), it follows from min (L) = 7 that

[formula]

Since S(L) does not have [formula], a9 = 0. Hence, we have the following possible theta series:

[formula]

If x∈S(L) with (x,x) = 2 then - x∈S(L). It follows from ([\ref=eq:C]) that B2 = 2 and B4 = 0. Hence, we have that

[formula]

Therefore, the theta series of L and S(L) are uniquely determined.

Now we start on the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. Let Λ be an extremal even unimodular lattice in dimension 72. Since Λ has minimum norm 8, there exists a vector x∈Λ with (x,x) = 8. Fix such a vector x. Put

[formula]

If (x,y) is even for all vectors y∈Λ then [formula] and [formula], which is a contradiction. Thus, Λ+x is a sublattice of Λ of index 2, and there exists a vector y∈Λ such that (x,y) is odd. Fix such a vector y. Define the lattice

[formula]

It is easy to see that Γx,y is an odd unimodular lattice, which is a neighbor of Λ.

We show that Γx,y has minimum norm 7. Since min (Λ+x)  ≥  8, it suffices to show that (u,u)  ≥  7 for all vectors [formula]. Let [formula] (α∈Λ+x). Then we have

[formula]

Here, we may assume without loss of generality that [formula]. Then

[formula]

If [formula] is the zero vector [formula] then [formula], which contradicts ([\ref=eq:1]). Hence, [formula] is a nonzero vector in Λ. Then we obtain 8  ≤  (u,u) + 1. Therefore, Γx,y is an odd unimodular lattice with minimum norm 7, which is a neighbor of Λ.

It follows that (Γx,y)0  =  Λ+x. For any vector α∈Λ+x, [formula]. Hence, [formula] is a vector of norm 2 in S(Γx,y). Therefore, we have Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

A similar argument can be found in [\cite=Venkov] for dimension 48.

By Lemma [\ref=lem:T], the theta series of Γx,y and S(Γx,y) are uniquely determined as ([\ref=eq:T1]) and ([\ref=eq:T2]), respectively.

The extremal even unimodular lattice in [\cite=Nebe72], which we denote by N72, contains a sublattice [formula], where L24 is isomorphic to [formula] and Λ24 is the Leech lattice. Since Λ24 contains many 4-frames, N72 contains many 8-frames (see e.g. [\cite=BDHO] [\cite=HMV] for undefined terms in this remark). Take one of the vectors of an 8-frame F as x in the construction of Γx,y. It follows that Γx,y  ⊃  Λ+x  ⊃  F. Therefore, there is a self-dual [formula]-code C72 of length 72 and minimum Euclidean weight 56 such that Γx,y is isomorphic to the lattice obtained from C72 by Construction A. A generator matrix of C72 can be obtained electronically from
