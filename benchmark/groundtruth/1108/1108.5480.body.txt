Quasiaffine orbits of invariant subspaces for uniform Jordan operators

Introduction

Let [formula] and [formula] be bounded linear operators on Hilbert spaces. If M1 and M2 are invariant subspaces for T1 and T2 respectively (that is [formula] and [formula] are closed subspaces such that T1M1  ⊂  M1 and T2M2  ⊂  M2), we say that M2 is a quasiaffine transform of M1 if there exists a bounded injective operator with dense range [formula] such that XT1 = T2X and [formula]. We write [formula] when M2 is a quasiaffine transform of M1. In that case, we also say that M2 lies in the quasiaffine orbit of M1. When [formula] and [formula], we say that M1 and M2 are quasisimilar and write M1  ~  M2. Quasisimilarity is clearly an equivalence relation on the class of pairs of the form (T,M), where M is an invariant subspace for the bounded linear operator T. In [\cite=B], Bercovici raised the basic problem underlying our present investigation: describe the quasiaffine orbit of a given invariant subspace for an operator of class C0 (see definition in Section 2).

Related results for general operators of class C0 can be found in [\cite=B], where it is proved that the quasisimilarity class of an invariant subspace is determined by the quasisimilarity class of the restriction T|M if and only if T has property (Q). Nilpotent operators of finite multiplicity have been considered in [\cite=LM2]. In that context, it was proved that the quasisimilarity class of M is determined by the quasisimilarity classes of the restriction T|M and of the compression [formula] when either of those operators has multiplicity one. In fact, for any operator T of class C0 with the property that T|M has multiplicity one, the weakly quasiaffine orbit of the invariant subspace is determined by the quasisimilarity classes of T|M and [formula] (see [\cite=BS2]).

The objects we will be concerned with in this work are the so-called uniform Jordan operators (that is [formula]). These operators appear to be more amenable, and our understanding of the quasisimilarity classes of their invariant subspaces is significantly better. In their pioneer work (see [\cite=BT]), Bercovici and Tannenbaum considered the case where T has finite multiplicity and established that M1  ~  M2 if and only if T|M1  ~  T|M2. Moreover, it was observed that for [formula], this classification breaks down, so the corresponding result fails if T is not uniform. Later on, it was proved in [\cite=B] that this classification holds for a uniform Jordan operator T if and only if T|M satisfies property (P). In general, the quasisimilarity class of an invariant subspace for a uniform Jordan operator is determined by the quasisimilarity classes of the restriction T|M and of the compression [formula] (see [\cite=BS1]). In this paper, we focus on the weaker notion of quasiaffine orbit. The main theorem gives a characterization of these orbits for uniform Jordan operators and as such it extends the aforementionned result.

Background and preliminaries

We give here some background concerning operators of class C0. Let H∞ be the algebra of bounded holomorphic functions on the open unit disc [formula]. Let [formula] be a Hilbert space and T a bounded linear operator on [formula], which we indicate by [formula]. The operator T is said to be of class C0 if there exists an algebra homomorphism [formula] with the following properties:

[formula] for every u∈H∞

Φ(p) = p(T) for every polynomial p

Φ is continuous when H∞ and [formula] are given their respective weak-star topologies

Φ has non-trivial kernel.

We use the notation Φ(u) = u(T), which is the Sz.-Nagy-Foias H∞ functional calculus. It is known that ker Φ = mTH∞ for some inner function mT called the minimal function of T. The minimal function is uniquely determined up to a scalar factor of absolute value one. A set [formula] is said to be cyclic for T if [formula]. The multiplicity of the operator T is the smallest cardinality of a cyclic set. If T has multiplicity one, it is said to be multiplicity-free.

Let H2 denote the Hilbert space of functions [formula] holomorphic in [formula] equipped with the norm [formula] For any inner function θ∈H∞, the space [formula] is invariant for S*, the adjoint of the shift operator S on H2. The operator S(θ) defined by [formula] is called a Jordan block; it is of class C0 with minimal function θ. We state some useful properties of these operators. Given functions u,v∈H∞, we say that u divides v and write u|v if there exists a function w∈H∞ such that v = wu.

Let θ∈H∞ be an inner function.

The operator S(θ) is multiplicity-free.

If φ∈H∞ is an inner divisor of θ, then [formula] is an invariant subspace for S(θ). In fact,

[formula]

Conversely, any invariant subspace for S(θ) is of this form.

A more general family of operators are the so-called Jordan operators. We will define them here in the case where the Hilbert space on which they act is separable. These operators are of the form [formula] where {θn}∞n = 0 is a sequence of inner functions satisfying θn + 1|θn for n  ≥  0. In case where θn  =  θ for every [formula] for some fixed inner function θ∈H∞, then the operator [formula] is called a uniform Jordan operator.

Recall that a bounded injective linear operator with dense range is called a quasiaffinity. Two operators [formula] and [formula] are said to be quasisimilar if there exist quasiaffinities [formula] and [formula] such that XT1 = T2X and T1Y = YT2. We use the notation T1  ~  T2 to indicate that T1 and T2 are quasisimilar. The Jordan operators are of fundamental importance in the study of operators of class C0 as the following theorem illustrates.

For any operator T of class C0 acting on a separable Hilbert space there exists a unique Jordan operator J such that T and J are quasisimilar.

The operator J in the previous theorem is called the Jordan model of T. We now collect some facts about invariant subspaces for operators of class C0.

Let [formula] be an operator of class C0. The following statements are equivalent:

T is multiplicity-free

{T}' is commutative

For every inner divisor θ of mT there exists a unique invariant subspace [formula] for T such that [formula]. In fact, [formula].

Given a subset [formula], we denote its commutant by

[formula]

We denote by [formula] the collection of invariant subspaces for an operator T, and by [formula] the algebra of operators X such that XM  ⊂  M for every [formula].

For an operator T of class C0 , we have [formula].

Let us recall a relation which is weaker than that of quasisimilarity. Given [formula] and [formula], we say that T1 can be injected in T2 if there exists an injective operator [formula] such that XT1 = T2X. We indicate the fact that T1 can be injected in T2 by [formula]. If in addition X has dense range, we say that T2 is a quasiaffine transform of T1 and we write [formula].

Let T1 and T2 be two operators of class C0. Then, the following are equivalent:

[formula]

[formula] and [formula]

T1  ~  T2.

Moreover, [formula] if and only if [formula]. If [formula] and [formula] are the Jordan models of T1 and T2 respectively, then [formula] if and only if θ(1)n|θ(2)n for every n  ≥  0.

Given an invariant subspace M for an operator T, we denote by [formula] the compression [formula]. The following two results concerning uniform Jordan operators are from [\cite=BS1].

Let [formula] and M be an invariant subspace for T. Assume that [formula] and [formula] are the Jordan models of T|M and [formula] respectively. Then,

φ0 and ψ0 divide θ

θ divides φmψn for every m,n  ≥  0.

Let [formula] and M be an invariant subspace for T. Assume that [formula] and [formula] are the Jordan models of T|M and [formula] respectively. Then, M is quasisimilar to

[formula]

where γn  =  θ  /  φn / 2 for n even, and γn  =  ψ(n - 1) / 2 for n odd.

Let us close this section by proving an elementary known fact which motivates our main result.

Let [formula] be operators of class C0 and let [formula] be invariant subspaces for T1 and T2 respectively. Assume that [formula]. Then, T1|M1  ~  T2|M2 and [formula].

By assumption, there exists a quasiaffinity [formula] such that XT1 = T2X and [formula]. It follows that X|M1 implements a quasiaffine transform between T1|M1 and T2|M2. Hence [formula] and Theorem [\ref=injection] implies that T1|M1  ~  T2|M2. Moreover, we have [formula] and thus [formula]. Since M2 is invariant for T2, we have [formula]. If we set [formula], we see that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=injection], we get

[formula]

and the proof is complete.

Our main result shows that the converse of the previous proposition holds in case where T1 = T2 is a uniform Jordan operator.

Uniform Jordan operators

Let us start with an elementary lemma.

Let φ,ψ∈H∞ be inner divisors of the inner function θ∈H∞. Assume that θ  /  φ divides ψ and set ω  =  ψ / (θ  /  φ). Then for every [formula] we can find [formula] such that ω(S(θ))f = g and [formula]

Fix [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=jordanblockprops], we have

[formula]

We can thus find [formula] such that ω(S(θ))f0 = g. We set f = PH(θ  /  ω)f0. Then, there exists a function h∈H2 such that f = f0 + (θ  /  ω)h, whence f = f0 + (θ  /  φ)(θ  /  ψ)h∈(θ  /  φ)H2 and thus [formula] since f∈H(θ  /  ω)  ⊂  H(θ). Moreover, ωf∈H(θ) and

[formula]

and since ω is an inner function, we have that [formula].

The following two lemmas provide the main tool in the proof of our main result.

Let θ∈H∞ be an inner function. Let [formula] and [formula]. Let (ωn)∞n = 0∈H∞ be a sequence of inner divisors of θ and let {cn}∞n = 0 be a bounded sequence of positive numbers. Define

[formula]

as follows

[formula]

Then, X is a quasiaffinity which commutes with [formula].

It is immediate that X is injective, and a routine calculation shows that X is bounded. Pick now [formula]. For m  ≥  0, define

[formula]

and

[formula]

We get that

[formula]

and thus [formula]. This shows that X has dense range. Finally, if we define χ∈H∞ as χ(z) = z for every [formula], then we have

[formula]

which completes the proof.

Let ψ1,ψ2∈H∞ be inner functions and (φn)∞n = 0∈H∞ be a sequence of inner functions. Assume the following divisibility relations:

ψ2 divides ψ1

φn divides θ for every n  ≥  0 and ψ1 divides θ

φn + 1 divides φn for every n  ≥  0

θ  /  φn divides ψ2 for every n  ≥  0.

Let [formula] and for each n  ≥  0 let ωn  =  ψ2 / (θ  /  φn). Define

[formula]

[formula]

where {cn}∞n = 0 is a sequence of positive numbers satisfying

[formula]

Then, we have [formula], where

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

First note that Nψ1  ⊂  Nψ2 since ψ2 divides ψ1. Moreover, it follows from Proposition [\ref=jordanblockprops] that for every n  ≥  0

[formula]

Therefore, we have [formula]

Let now [formula], in other words [formula] and [formula] for every n  ≥  0. It follows from ([\ref=rangewn]) that

[formula]

for every m  ≥  0. Consequently, if we set h0 = 0, then by Lemma [\ref=open] we can find for every m  ≥  1 a function [formula] such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Note now that ωn(S(θ)) is a contraction for every n  ≥  0 since ωn∈H∞ is an inner function. Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we get for every m  ≥  1 that

[formula]

Hence, we have that [formula] as m  →    ∞  . Indeed

[formula]

and the right-hand side goes to zero as m goes to infinity in view of ([\ref=convergence]). Moreover,

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

and thus

[formula]

But

[formula]

for every m  ≥  1, so that [formula]

We can now establish our main result.

Let [formula] and M1,M2 be invariant subspaces for T. Then [formula] if and only if T|M1  ~  T|M2 and [formula].

One direction follows from Proposition [\ref=easydirection]. Assume therefore that T|M1  ~  T|M2 and [formula]. Let [formula] be the Jordan model of T|M1 and T|M2, and let [formula] and [formula] be the Jordan models of [formula] and [formula] respectively. Define

[formula]

[formula]

where γn  =  θ  /  φn / 2 for n even, γn  =  ψ(n - 1) / 2 for n odd, δn  =  θ  /  φn / 2 for n even and δn  =  τ(n - 1) / 2 for n odd. By Theorem [\ref=canspace], we have that M1  ~  M1' and M2  ~  M2', so it suffices to show that [formula].

Let [formula] and fix a bijection [formula], where [formula]. Define

[formula]

as follows

[formula]

It is clear that V is an isometry with isometric inverse being

[formula]

Hence, V is unitary and a straightforward verification shows that V satisfies

[formula]

Abusing notation, we will identify Φ- 1(n,m) with (n,m) for every n,m  ≥  0. We have

[formula]

and similarly

[formula]

Note now that since [formula], Theorem [\ref=injection] implies that τn divides ψn for every n  ≥  0. We see by Proposition [\ref=divrel] that we can apply Lemma [\ref=qa] and Lemma [\ref=invsub] to get for each n  ≥  0 a quasiaffinity Xn commuting with [formula] and satisfying

[formula]

Set

[formula]

It is then easy to check that [formula] and that Y is a quasiaffinity commuting with T. Hence, [formula] and we are done.

Uniform Jordan models

The aim of this section is to relax the assumption on T being a uniform Jordan operator. Namely, we would like to get a result analogous to Theorem [\ref=mainjordan] in the case where T is merely quasisimilar to a uniform Jordan operator. We can actually achieve this under an extra assumption. We first need a preliminary fact.

Let T be an operator of class C0 and let [formula] be an injective operator. Then, [formula] for every [formula].

Let [formula]. Using Theorem [\ref=existencejordan], we can decompose M into cyclic subspaces: [formula] where [formula] and T|Kj is multiplicity-free. Since [formula], we have [formula] for every j  ≥  0. On the other hand, the fact that X is an injective operator commuting with T implies that [formula] for every j  ≥  0. By Proposition [\ref=prop1.10], we conclude that [formula] for every j  ≥  0, which in turn implies [formula].

Let [formula] be an operator of class C0 with uniform Jordan model [formula]. Assume that we can find quasiaffinities [formula] and [formula] with the property that XT = JX, YJ = TY and [formula]. Then, given [formula] we have that [formula] if and only if T|M1  ~  T|M2 and [formula].

One direction follows from Proposition [\ref=easydirection]. Assume therefore that T|M1  ~  T|M2 and [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula]. It follows that J|E1  ~  T|M1  ~  T|M2  ~  J|E2. Moreover, notice that YX is a quasiaffinity commuting with T, so that by Lemma [\ref=alglatqa] we have [formula] for k = 1,2. In particular, this shows that [formula] for k = 1,2. We can therefore write [formula] and [formula] for k = 1,2. Since [formula] can be injected into [formula], it follows from Theorem [\ref=injection] that [formula] can be injected into [formula], so we can find an injective operator [formula] such that [formula]. Set [formula], which is obviously injective. Note that for k = 1,2 we have

[formula]

[formula]

and it follows that

[formula]

Thus [formula] can be injected into [formula], whence [formula] can be injected into [formula] via another application of Theorem [\ref=injection]. By Theorem [\ref=mainjordan], we can find a quasiaffinity A∈{J}' such that [formula]. Define finally B = YAX which is clearly another quasiaffinity. We then have

[formula]

and

[formula]

and the proof is complete.

In closing, let us mention an example where the extra assumption [formula] appearing in Theorem [\ref=YXalg] is satisfied.

Let [formula] be a multiplicity-free operator of class C0 and let [formula]. Given M1 and M2 two invariant subspaces for T, we have that [formula] if and only if T|M1  ~  T|M2 and [formula].

Denote by θ the minimal function of T0. By assumption, we can find quasiaffinities [formula] and [formula] with the property that XT = S(θ)X, YS(θ) = TY. Define [formula] and [formula], which are quasiaffinities intertwining T with its Jordan model [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=YXalg], we need only show that [formula].

Since T0 is multiplicity-free, Proposition [\ref=prop1.10] implies that {T0}' is commutative, and thus {T0}'' = {T0}'. Therefore, YX∈{T0}'' and [formula] then clearly belongs to {T}'' since

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=alglat], we find that [formula] which completes the proof.
