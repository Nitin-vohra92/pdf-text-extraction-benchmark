On the mod p7 determination of [formula]

Introduction and Statement of Results

Wolstenholme's theorem (e.g. see [\cite=W], [\cite=Gr]) asserts that if p is a prime greater than 3, then the binomial coefficient [formula] satisfies the congruence

[formula]

for any prime p  ≥  5. It is well known (e.g. see [\cite=HW]) that this theorem is equivalent to the assertion that the numerator of the fraction [formula] is divisible by p2 for any prime p  ≥  5.

Further, by a special case of Glaisher's congruence ([\cite=Gl1], [\cite=Gl2]; also cf. [\cite=M]), for any prime p  ≥  5 we have

[formula]

where Bk is the kth Bernoulli number. A. Granville [\cite=Gr] established broader generalizations of Wolstenholme's theorem. More recently, C. Helou and G. Terjanian [\cite=HT] established many Wolstenholme's type congruences modulo pk with a prime p and k∈{4,5,6}. One of their main results [\cite=HT] is a congruence of the form [formula], where p  ≥  3 is a prime number, [formula] with 0  ≤  m  ≤  n, and f is the function on m,n and p involving Bernoulli numbers Bk [formula]. In particular, for p  ≥  5, m = 1 and n = 2, using the fact that [formula], this congruence yields [\cite=HT]

[formula]

Recently, R. Tauraso [\cite=T] proved that for any prime p > 5

In this paper we improve the above congruence as follows.

Let p  ≥  11 be a prime. Then

[formula]

Note that the congruence [\eqref=cong1.4] for p = 3 and p = 5 reduces to the identity, while for p = 7 [\eqref=cong1.4] is satisfied modulo 76.

Applying a technique of Helou and Terjanian [\cite=HT] based on Kummer type congruences, the congruence [\eqref=cong1.4] may be expressed in terms of the Bernoulli numbers as follows.

Let p  ≥  11 be a prime. Then

[formula]

Note that reducing the moduli, and using the Kummer congruences.from [\eqref=cong1.5] can be easily deduced the congruence [\eqref=congr1.3].

(cf. [\cite=T]). Let p  ≥  7 be a prime. Then

([\cite=Z2], [\cite=M]). Let p  ≥  7 be a prime. Then

A prime p is said to be a Wolstenholme prime if it satisfies the congruence [formula] By the congruence (1.2) we see that a prime p is a Wolstenholme prime if and only if p divides the numerator of Bp - 3. The two known such primes are 16843 and 2124679, and recently, R.J. McIntosh and E.L. Roettger [\cite=MR] reported that these primes are only two Wolstenholme primes less than 109. However, by using the argument based on the prime number theorem, McIntosh [\cite=M] conjectured that there are infinitely many Wolstenholme primes, and that no prime satisfies the congruence [formula].

In [\cite=Me] the author proved that for any Wolstenholme prime p holds

[formula]

and conjectured [\cite=Me] that any of the previous congruences for a prime p yields that p is necessarily a Wolstenholme prime. Note that this conjecture concerning the first above congruence may be confirmed by using our congruence [\eqref=cong1.4]. Namely, if a prime p satisfied the first congruence of [\eqref=cong1.6], then by [\eqref=cong1.4] must be

[formula]

Using the identity

[formula]

the second congruence in [\eqref=cong1.7] immediately reduces to

[formula]

whence it follows that

[formula]

Finally, substituting this into the first Glaisher's congruence in [\eqref=cong1.2], we find that

[formula]

Hence, p must be a Wolstenholme prime, and so, our conjecture is confirmed related to the first congruence of [\eqref=cong1.6].

The situation is more complicated in relation to the conjecture concerning the second congruence of [\eqref=cong1.6]. Then comparing this congruence and [\eqref=cong1.4], as in the previous case we obtain

[formula]

However, from the above congruence we are unable to deduce that p must be a Wolstenholme prime.

It follows from Corollary 1.5 that [formula] and [formula] for any Wolstenholme prime p. This argument together with a technique applied in the proof of Theorem 1.1 suggests the conjecture that such a prime p satisfies the congruence [\eqref=cong1.4] modulo p8. However, a direct calculation shows that this is not true for the Wolstenholme prime 16843.

As noticed in Remark 1.2, the congruence [\eqref=cong1.4] for p = 3 and p = 5 reduces to the identity. However, our computation via Mathematica shows that no prime in the range 7  ≤  p < 500000 satisfies the congruence [\eqref=cong1.4] with the modulus p8 instead of p7. Nevertheless, using the heuristic argument for the "probability" that a prime p satisfies [\eqref=cong1.4] modulo p8 is about 1 / p, we conjecture that there are infinitely many primes satisfying [\eqref=cong1.4] modulo p8.

Proof of Theorem 1.1 and Corollaries 1.4 and 1.5

For the proof of Theorem 1.1, we will need some elementary auxiliary results.

For a prime p  ≥  3 and a positive integer n  ≤  p - 2 we denote

[formula]

with the convention that H1(p) = R1(p). In the sequel we shall often write throughout proofs Rn and Hn instead of Rn(p) and Hn(p), respectively.

Observe that by Wolstenholme's theorem, p2|R1(p) for any prime p  ≥  5, which can be generalized as follows.

For any prime p  ≥  5 and a positive integer n  ≤  p - 3, we have

[formula]

For any prime p  ≥  7, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

In particular, p2|H3(p), p|H2(p) and p|H4(p).

Substituting the shuffle relation H2 = (R21 - R2) / 2 into the identity 3H3 = R3 - R1R2 + H2R1, we find that [formula]. This equality together with the fact that p2|R1 yields the congruence (2.1), and thus p2|H3.

Similarly, by Newton's formula [\cite=J], we have the identity

[formula]

Since by Lemma 2.1, p4|R1R3 = H1R3, and since p2|H3 we also have p4|H3R1. Substituting this and H2 = (R21 - R2) / 2 into the above identity, we obtain

[formula]

Since by Lemma 2.1, p5|R21R2, we can exclude the term R21R2 / 2 in the above congruence to obtain (2.2), and so p|H4. This completes the proof.

For any prime p and any positive integer r, we have

[formula]

Multiplying the identity

[formula]

by - p / i2 (1  ≤  i  ≤  p - 1), we obtain

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

whence after summation over [formula] we immediately obtain (2.3). This concludes the proof.

For any prime p  ≥  7 we have and for any prime p  ≥  11 holds

Note that by Lemma 2.3,

[formula]

Since by Lemma 2.1, p2|R3 and p|R4 for any prime p  ≥  7, the above congruence reduces to the first congruence in our lemma.

Since for each 1  ≤  k  ≤  p - 1

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

First observe that, applying Lemma 2.1, for each prime p  ≥  11 we have

[formula]

Further, in view of the fact that [formula], and that for each prime p  ≥  11, p|R6 and p2|R5 by Lemma 2.1, we have

[formula]

Substituting (2.5) and (2.6) into (2.4), we get

[formula]

Next from the identity

[formula]

for [formula], we obtain

[formula]

After summation over [formula], the above congruence gives

[formula]

Since by Lemma 2.1, p|R6 for any prime p  ≥  11, substituting this and (2.6) into the above congruence, we obtain

[formula]

Substituting this into (2.7), we finally obtain

[formula]

This completes the proof.

For any prime p  ≥  11, we have

[formula]

By Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2, we have [formula] and [formula] for any prime p  ≥  11. Since by Newton's formula, [formula] and [formula], it follows from the previous congruences that p2|H5 and p|H6. Therefore, [formula] for any prime p  ≥  11, and so the above expansion yields

[formula]

Recall that H1 = R1 and H2 = (R21 - R2) / 2. The congruences from Lemma 2.2 yield [formula] and [formula]. Substituting all the previous expressions for Hi, i = 1,2,3,4, into (2.8), we find that

[formula]

Further, by Lemma 2.4, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

The congruences (2.10) and (2.11) yield [formula] and [formula], respectively. Substituting these congruences into the last term on the right hand side of (2.9), we obtain

[formula]

It remains to eliminate R3 from (2.12). Note that by Lemma 2.3, [formula]. Since by Lemma 2.2, p2|R5 and p|R6, the previous congruence reduces to

[formula]

We use again the congruence (2.11) in the form [formula], which by inserting in (2.13) yields [formula]. Multipying by 3p, this implies

[formula]

Substituting this into the last term of (2.13), we immediately get

[formula]

Now we write (2.10) as

[formula]

Since p2|R1, and so p4|p2R1, multiplying the above congruence by [formula], we find that

[formula]

Replacing this into (2.15), we obtain

[formula]

which by the identity (R21 - R2) / 2 = H2 yields the desired congruence. This completes the proof.

The first congruence in Corollary 1.4 for p  ≥  11 is immediate from (2.16), using the fact that p2|R1, and so p6|p2R21. Since from (2.14) we have [formula], inserting this into the first congruence in Corollary 1.4, we immediately obtain which is just the second congruence in Corollary 1.4.

A calculation shows that both congruences are also satisfied for p = 7, and the proof is completed.

Let p  ≥  7 be any prime. By Corollary 1.4, we have [formula]. Substituting into this [formula] (Lemma 2.4), we obtain as desired.

Proof of Corollary 1.3

As noticed in the Introduction, in the proof of Corollary 1.3, we wiil apply a method of Helou and Terjanian [\cite=HT] based on Kummer type congruences.

Let p be a prime, and let m be any even positive integer. Then the denominator dm of the Bernoulli number Bm written in reduced form, is given by

[formula]

where the product is taken over those primes p such that p - 1 divides m.

The assertion is an immediate consequence of the von Staudt-Clausen theorem (eg. see [\cite=I], p. 233, Theorem 3) which asserts that [formula] is an integer for all even m, where the summation is over all primes p such that p - 1 divides m.

For a prime p and a positive integer n, we denote

[formula]

Let p be a prime greater than 5, and let n,r be positive integers. Then

[formula]

where ordp(s) is the largest power of p dividing s, and the summation is taken over all integers 1  ≤  s  ≤  n + 1 such that s - ordp(s)  ≤  r.

The following result is well known as the Kummer congruences.

. Suppose that p  ≥  3 is a prime and m, n, r are positive integers such that m and n are even, r  ≤  n - 1  ≤  m - 1 and [formula]. If [formula], where φ(pr) = pr - 1(p - 1) is the Euler's totient function, then

[formula]

The following congruences are also due to Kummer.

. Let p  ≥  3 be a prime and let m, r be positive integers such that m is even, r  ≤  m - 1 and [formula]. Then

[formula]

For any prime p  ≥  11, we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

If s is a positive integer such that ordp(s) = e  ≥  1, then for p  ≥  11 holds s - e  ≥  pe - e  ≥  10. This shows that the condition s - ordp(s)  ≤  6 implies that ordp(s) = 0, and thus, for such a s must be s  ≤  6. Therefore

[formula]

By Euler's theorem [\cite=HW], for 1  ≤  k  ≤  p - 1, and positive integers n,e we have [formula], where φ(pe) = pe - 1(p - 1) is the Euler's totient function. Hence, [formula]. In particular, if n = φ(p6) - 1 = p5(p - 1) - 1, then by Lemma 3.1, p6|p6Bp5(p - 1) - 6 for each prime p  ≥  11. Therefore, using the fact that Bp5(p - 1) - 1 = Bp5(p - 1) - 3 = Bp5(p - 1) - 5 = 0, (12) yields

[formula]

whence we have

[formula]

By the Kummer congruences [\eqref=cong3.2] from Lemma 3.3, we have

[formula]

Substituting this into [\eqref=cong3.5], we obtain

[formula]

Similarly, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Substituting the above two congruences into [\eqref=cong3.6], we get

[formula]

Finally, since

[formula]

the substitution of the above congruence into [\eqref=cong3.7] immediately gives the congruence (i).

Further, [\eqref=cong3.7] immediately gives

[formula]

Again by the Kummer congruences [\eqref=cong3.2] from Lemma 3.3, we have

[formula]

Substituting this into [\eqref=cong3.7], we immediately obtain the congruence (ii).

In order to prove the congruence (iii), note that if [formula], then by Lemma 3.1, for even n  ≥  6 holds p5|p5Bn - 4, and we known that Bn - 1 = Bn - 3 = 0 for such a n. Therefore, reducing the modulus in [\eqref=cong3.4] to p5, and using the same argument as in the begin of the proof of (i), for all even n  ≥  2 holds

[formula]

In particular, for n = p4 - p3 - 2 and using [formula], [\eqref=cong3.9] reduces to

[formula]

This completes the proof.

The congruence of Corollary 1.3 follows directly by substituting the congruences (i), (ii) and (iii) of Lemma 3.5 into the congruence [\eqref=cong1.4] of Theorem 1.1.
