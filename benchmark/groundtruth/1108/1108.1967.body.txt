Introduction

The maximal group of Lie point symmetries of the system

[formula]

has been presented in [\cite=iik09]. It is generated by the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra spanned by the following operators:

[formula]

Conservation law provided by semi-dilation

Consider the operator X8 from ([\ref=SphNR.eq4]),

[formula]

It generates the following one-parameter transformation group with the parameter ε:

[formula]

Since some of variables, namely t,x,z and ψ are subjected to dilations while two other variables transform otherwise, we call ([\ref=SphNR.eq6]) the semi-dilation group. Let us construct the conserved vector provided by this group.

Computation of the conservation law density

We will use the following formula for computing the density of conservation laws (see Eq. (3.23) in [\cite=ibr-ibr09b])

[formula]

where (see Eq. (3.16) in [\cite=ibr-ibr09b])

[formula]

These formulas are written using the notation t, x, z, v, ρ, ψ.

In the case of the operator ([\ref=SphNR.eq5]) the quantities ([\ref=SphNR.eq8]) are written:

[formula]

Substituting ([\ref=SphNR.eq9]) in ([\ref=SphNR.eq8]) we obtain upon simple calculations:

[formula]

We can drop the last term in ([\ref=SphNR.eq10]) because it can be written in the divergent form upon elimination of vt, ρ4 and ψt by using Eqs. ([\ref=SphNR.eq1])-([\ref=SphNR.eq3]). Indeed, it is shown in [\cite=ibr-ibr09b], Section 4.6, that the expression in the square brackets (cf. Eq. (4.11) in [\cite=ibr-ibr09b]) evaluated on the solutions of Eqs. ([\ref=SphNR.eq1])-([\ref=SphNR.eq3]) has the divergent form. Multiplication by t does not violate this property. Then we use the identities

[formula]

drop the divergent type terms and obtain the following conserved density:

[formula]

Finally we note that the last term in ([\ref=SphNR.eq11]) is the energy density (see Eq. (4.17) in [\cite=ibr-ibr09b]). Therefore we eliminate it and conclude that the invariance under the semi-dilation with the generator ([\ref=SphNR.eq5]) provides the conservation law with the density

[formula]

Conserved vector

Let us find the components C2, C3 of the conserved vector with the density ([\ref=SphNR.eq12]). We will apply the procedure used in [\cite=ibr-ibr09b], Section 4.7. We have:

[formula]

Using Eqs. ([\ref=SphNR.eq1])-([\ref=SphNR.eq3]), we obtain:

[formula]

One can rewrite this equation, using Eq. (4.23) from [\cite=ibr-ibr09b], in the following form:

[formula]

Thus, the generator ([\ref=SphNR.eq5]) provides the conservation law

[formula]

with the density P given by ([\ref=SphNR.eq12]) and the flux given by the equations

[formula]

Conserved density [formula] of the generalized invariant solution

If we substitute in ([\ref=SphNR.eq12]) the generalized invariant solution (5.28)-(5.30) from our paper [\cite=ibr-ibr09b],

[formula]

we obtain:

[formula]

Conservation law provided by the rotation

Taking the rotation generator X9 from ([\ref=SphNR.eq4]) and proceedings as in Section [\ref=sd:cons] we obtain the following conserved density:

[formula]

Writing Eqs. ([\ref=SphNR.eq1])-([\ref=SphNR.eq3]) by using the Jacobians J(ψ,v)  =  ψxvz  -  ψzvx, etc., we have:

[formula]

The reckoning shows that

[formula]

Substituting these expressions in Eq. ([\ref=SphNR.rot2]) we conclude that the rotation generator X9 provides the conservation law

[formula]

with the density P given by ([\ref=SphNR.rot1]) and the flux given by the equations

[formula]

Summary of conservation laws

It has been demonstrated in [\cite=ibr-ibr09b] that the system of nonlinear equations ([\ref=SphNR.eq1])-([\ref=SphNR.eq3]) is self-adjoint. This property of the system has been used for deriving local conservation laws applying the method developed in [\cite=ibr07a] to the infinitesimal symmetries ([\ref=SphNR.eq4]). Some of the conservation laws associated with these symmetries are trivial, i.e. have vanishing densities. But five conservation laws are nontrivial.

The nontrivial conservation laws obtained in [\cite=ibr-ibr09b] and in the present paper are summarized below. For the convenience of the reader, we formulate them both in the integral and differential forms.

The conservation law ([\ref=Acl:i3]) defines the energy of the system. It seems that the conservation laws ([\ref=Acl:i4]) and ([\ref=Acl:i5]), unlike ([\ref=Acl:i3]), do not have direct analogies in mechanics and should be investigated from point of view of their physical significance. 22 April 2009
