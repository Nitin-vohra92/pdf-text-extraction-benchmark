Abstract

We introduce the notion of CR quaternionic map and we prove that any such real-analytic map, between CR quaternionic manifolds, is the restriction of a quaternionic map between quaternionic manifolds. As an application, we prove, for example, that for any submanifold M, of dimension 4k - 1 , of a quaternionic manifold N, such that TM generates a quaternionic subbundle of TN|M, of (real) rank 4k , there exists, locally, a quaternionic submanifold of N, containing M as a hypersurface.

Introduction

An almost quaternionic manifold is a manifold M whose tangent bundle is a quaternionic vector bundle (see, for example, [\cite=AleMar-Annali96] , [\cite=IMOP] , and, also, Section [\ref=section:cr_q_mfds] , below). Further, any compatible connection on M induces an almost complex structure on the bundle Z of admissible linear complex structures, whose integrability characterises the integrability of the almost quaternionic structure of M (that is, if dim M  ≥  8 , the existence of a torsion free compatible connection; see [\cite=IMOP] ); then Z is the twistor space of M. Accordingly, a quaternionic map [\cite=IMOP] between quaternionic manifolds is, essentially, a map admitting a holomorphic lift between the corresponding twistor spaces. This generalizes the well-known notion of quaternionic submanifold (necessarily, totally geodesic with respect to any compatible torsion free connection [\cite=AleMar-Report93] ; see [\cite=PePoSw-98] ). However, not all submanifolds of a quaternionic manifold are quaternionic (take, for example, any hypersurface). Nevertheless, the generic submanifold, of codimension at most 2k - 1 , of a quaternionic manifold, of dimension 4k , inherits a CR quaternionic structure; moreover, any real-analytic CR quaternionic structure is obtained this way through a germ unique embedding into a quaternionic manifold, which is called its heaven space [\cite=fq] . In this note, we strengthen this result by proving that any real-analytic CR quaternionic map (that is, any real-analytic map admitting a CR lift between the corresponding twistor spaces) is the restriction of a quaternionic map between quaternionic manifolds (Theorem [\ref=thm:cr_q_maps] ). This shows that the CR quaternionic maps are the natural morphisms of the CR Quaternionic Geometry. We, also, apply this result to the study of (almost) CR quaternionic submanifolds, thus, obtaining Corollaries [\ref=cor:cr_q_submfd_real_analytic] and [\ref=cor:cr_q_submfd_codim] . By the latter, for any submanifold M, of dimension 4k - 1 , of a quaternionic manifold N, such that TM generates a quaternionic subbundle of TN|M, of (real) rank 4k , there exists, locally, a quaternionic submanifold of N, containing M as a hypersurface.

Brief review of CR quaternionic linear maps

Recall (see [\cite=IMOP] , [\cite=fq] and the references therein) that a linear complex structure on a (real) vector space U is a linear map J:U  →  U such that J2 =  - IdU . Then the -  i eigenspace C of J satisfies [formula]; moreover, any such complex vector subspace of the complexification [formula] is the -  i eigenspace of a (unique) linear complex structure on U. More generally, a linear CR structure on a vector space U is a complex vector subspace [formula] such that [formula] . A map t:(U,C)  →  (U',C') between CR vector spaces is a CR linear map if it is linear and t(C)  ⊆  C' (see [\cite=fq] and [\cite=fq_2] for these and, also, for the dual notion of linear co-CR structure). There are other ways to describe a linear CR structure. For example, if C is a linear CR structure on U and we denote [formula], and by ι:U  →  E the composition of the inclusion [formula] followed by the projection [formula] then  (a) ι is injective,  (b) im  ι + J(im  ι) = E ,  (c) [formula] , where J is the linear complex structure of E. Moreover, the pair (E,ι) is unique, up to complex linear isomorphisms, with these properties. Thus, we could define a linear CR structure on a vector space U as a pair (E,ι) , where E is a complex vector space and ι:U  →  E is a linear map satisfying properties (a) and (b) , above. Furthermore, in this setting, the CR linear maps t:(U,E,ι)  →  (U',E',ι') are characterised by the fact that there exists a (necessarily unique, if [formula]) complex linear map [formula] such that [formula] .

t is injective if and only if [formula] is injective.

The fact that [formula] injective implies t injective is obvious. For the converse, it is sufficient to consider the case U' = E'. Let F be the complex vector subspace of E' spanned by the image of t. Then [formula] decomposes into a complex linear isomorphism from E onto F followed by the inclusion of F into E'.

Let [formula] be the division algebra of quaternions, and note that its automorphism group is SO(3) acting trivially on [formula] and canonically on [formula] . A linear quaternionic structure on a vector space U is an equivalence class of morphisms of associative algebras from [formula] to End(U) , where two such morphisms σ and τ are equivalent if [formula] , for some a∈SO(3) . Note that, if [formula] defines a linear quaternionic structure on U then the space of admissible linear complex structures Z = σ(S2) is well-defined [\cite=AleMar-Annali96] . Let U and U' be quaternionic vector spaces and let Z and Z' be the corresponding spaces of admissible linear complex structures, respectively. A quaternionic linear map from U to U' is a linear map t:U  →  U' for which there exists a function T:Z  →  Z' such that [formula] , for any J∈Z ; then, if [formula] , we have that T is unique and an orientation preserving isometry [\cite=IMOP] .

1) A linear CR quaternionic structure on a vector space U is a pair (E,ι) , where E is a quaternionic vector space and ι:U  →  E is an injective linear map such that im  ι + J(im  ι) = E , for any admissible linear complex structure J on E . 2) A CR quaternionic linear map t:(U,E,ι)  →  (U',E',ι') between CR quaternionic vector spaces is a linear map t:U  →  U' for which there exists a quaternionic linear map [formula] such that [formula] .

Any quaternionic vector space of (real) dimension 4k is (non-canonically) isomorphic to [formula]. More generally (and much less trivial), any CR quaternionic vector spaces is isomorphic to a finite product, unique up to the order of factors, in which each factor is contained by one of the following two classes [\cite=fq] .

It follows that if E is a quaternionic vector space, dim E = 4k , and U  ⊆  E is a generic vector subspace, of codimension at most 2k - 1 , then (U,E) is a CR quaternionic vector space [\cite=fq] .

CR quaternionic manifolds

An almost CR structure on a manifold M is a complex vector subbundle C of [formula] such that [formula] . An (integrable almost) CR structure is an almost CR structure whose space of sections is closed under the usual bracket. If M is a (real) hypersurface in a complex manifold (N,J) then [formula] is a CR structure on M. This admits a straightforward generalization to higher codimensions. Furthermore, any real-analytic CR structure is obtained this way through a germ unique embedding into a complex manifold [\cite=AndFre] . Let [formula] be a (finite-dimensional) associative algebra. A bundle of associative algebras, with typical fibre [formula] , is a vector bundle A, with typical fibre [formula] , whose structural group is the automorphism group of [formula] ; in particular, each fibre of A is an associative algebra (non-canonically) isomorphic to [formula] . A morphism of bundles of associative algebras is a vector bundle morphism whose restriction to each fibre is a morphism of associative algebras. A quaternionic vector bundle is a vector bundle E endowed with a pair (A,σ) , where A is a bundle of associative algebras, with typical fibre [formula], and σ:A  →  End(E) is a morphism of bundles of associative algebras. Then the bundle Z of admissible linear complex structures on E is the sphere bundle of σ(Im  A) ; in particular, the typical fibre of Z is the Riemann sphere. An almost CR quaternionic structure [\cite=fq] on a manifold M is a pair (E,ι) , where E is a quaternionic vector bundle over M and ι:TM  →  E is an injective vector bundle morphism such that (Ex,ιx) is a linear CR quaternionic structure on TxM, for any x∈M (see [\cite=fq_2] for the dual notion of almost co-CR quaternionic structure). Let (E,ι) be an almost quaternionic structure on M and let [formula] be a compatible connection on E. Then [formula] induces a connection on the bundle Z of admissible linear complex structures on E. Denote by B the complex vector subbundle of [formula] whose fibre, at each J∈Z, is the horizontal lift of [formula] , where π:Z  →  M is the projection. Then [formula] is an almost CR structure on Z . If C is integrable then [formula] is a CR quaternionic structure, [formula] is a CR quaternionic manifold and (Z,C) is its twistor space. Also, (M,Z,π,C) is the twistorial structure [\cite=LouPan-II] of [formula] . Note that, if ι is a vector bundle isomorphism then we retrieve the usual notion of quaternionic structure/manifold (see [\cite=IMOP] ). Let M be a hypersurface in a quaternionic manifold N. Then [formula] is a CR quaternionic structure on M, where ι:TM  →  TN|M is the inclusion and [formula] is any quaternionic connection on N (that is, [formula] is a torsion free compatible connection on N). Further, this admits a straightforward generalization to higher codimensions. Moreover, any real-analytic CR quaternionic structure is obtained this way through a germ unique embedding into a quaternionic manifold, which is called its heaven space [\cite=fq] .

CR quaternionic maps

Let (M,EM,ιM) and (N,EN,ιN) be almost CR quaternionic manifolds and let πM:ZM  →  M and πN:ZN  →  N be the corresponding bundles of admissible linear complex structures, respectively. Also, let φ:M  →  N and [formula] be maps. We say that φ:(M,EM,ιM)  →  (N,EN,ιN) is an almost CR quaternionic map, with respect to [formula], if [formula] is CR quaternionic, with respect to [formula] , at each point x∈M. Suppose that EM and EN are endowed with compatible connections [formula] and [formula], respectively, with respect to which M and N become CR quaternionic manifolds; denote by CM and CN the corresponding CR structures on ZM and ZN , respectively. The map φ:(M,EM,ιM)  →  (N,EN,ιN) is CR quaternionic, with respect to [formula], if [formula] and [formula] is a CR map. The notions of (almost) CR quaternionic immersion/submersion/diffeomorphism are defined, accordingly. Note that, the CR quaternionic maps are just twistorial maps (see [\cite=LouPan-II] for the definition of the latter). Also, for maps of rank at least one, between quaternionic manifolds, the two notions coincide [\cite=IMOP] . That is why we call quaternionic maps the (almost) CR quaternionic maps, between (almost) quaternionic manifolds. Furthermore, any CR quaternionic map is, obviously, almost CR quaternionic. However, the converse does not hold, as the following example shows.

Let M and N be real-analytic CR quaternionic manifolds and let [formula] and [formula] be the corresponding heaven spaces, respectively. If φ:M  →  N is a real-analytic map whose differential is nowhere zero then the following assertions are equivalent.   φ is CR quaternionic (with respect to some real-analytic lift between the twistor spaces of M and N).   φ is the restriction of a germ unique quaternionic map [formula] defined on some open neighbourhood of M in [formula] and with values in [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula] be the twistor spaces of [formula] and [formula], respectively. If we denote by ZM and ZN their restrictions to M and N we obtain (generic) CR submanifolds which are the twistor spaces of M and N, respectively. Denote by [formula] and [formula] the projections and by πM and πN their restrictions to ZM and ZN , respectively. Suppose that (i) holds and let [formula] be a real-analytic CR map with respect to which φ is CR quaternionic. Note that, locally, any real-analytic CR function on ZM is the restriction of a unique holomorphic function on [formula] . Thus, if f is a holomorphic function, locally defined on [formula] , then [formula] is the restriction of some holomorphic function, locally defined on [formula] . Consequently, [formula] is the restriction of some germ unique holomorphic map [formula] defined on some open neighbourhood Z of ZM in [formula] . As [formula] restricted to each fibre of πM is a holomorphic diffeomorphism (in fact, an orientation preserving isometry), by passing if necessary to an open subset of Z, we may suppose that [formula] restricted to each twistor line is a holomorphic diffeomorphism. Then [formula] maps the family of twistor lines contained by Z into a family of complex projective lines which, obviously, contains the fibres of πN . As the families of twistor lines (on the twistor spaces of quaternionic manifolds) are locally complete, we obtain that [formula] maps twistor lines to twistor lines. Let [formula] and [formula] be the conjugations on [formula] and [formula] , respectively, which on the fibres of the projections [formula] and [formula] are given by the antipodal map. Obviously, [formula] is, also, a holomorphic extension of [formula]. Hence, [formula] on [formula] (which, obviously, contains ZM ). Therefore [formula] maps real twistor lines to real twistor lines. But the real twistor lines are just the fibres of [formula] and [formula] . Hence, [formula] descends to a quaternionic map, as required. Suppose, now, that (ii) holds and let [formula] be a quaternionic extension of φ . Then by [\cite=IMOP] we have that [formula] admits a holomorphic lift [formula] which, obviously, restricts to a CR map [formula] which is a lift of φ . Thus, φ is CR quaternionic.

For applications we shall, also, need the following:

Let M be an almost CR quaternionic submanifold of a CR quaternionic manifold N; denote by E the corresponding quaternionic vector bundle on M. Then there exists a connection on E with respect to which M is a CR quaternionic submanifold of N.

Let Z be the bundle of admissible linear complex structures on E. Then the connection on the corresponding quaternionic vector bundle over N induces a connection on Z . Locally, we can write [formula], with H and F complex vector bundles of ranks 2 and 2k , and structural groups Sp(1) and [formula] , respectively, where [formula] . Then Z = PH and the connection on Z corresponds to a connection [formula] on H. Thus, if [formula] is any connection on F (compatible with its structural group) then [formula] is the complexification of a connection on E, which is as required.

More can be said about the CR quaternionic submanifolds of a quaternionic manifold.

Let (M,E) be a real-analytic almost CR quaternionic submanifold of a quaternionic manifold N. Then the following assertions hold: (i) The inclusion from M into N extends to a germ unique quaternionic immersion from a quaternionic manifold P to N, with [formula]. (ii) Any quaternionic connection on N induces, by restriction, a connection on E with respect to which M is a CR quaternionic submanifold of N.

Assertion (i) is an immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm:cr_q_maps] , and Lemmas [\ref=lem:cr_subspace] and [\ref=lem:cr_q_submfd] . Assertion (ii) is an immediate consequence of (i) and the fact that the quaternionic submanifolds are totally geodesic with respect to any quaternionic connection on the ambient space [\cite=AleMar-Report93] (see [\cite=IMOP] ).

We end with the following result (cf. [\cite=Mar-Rend90] ).

Let φ:M  →  N be an immersion from a manifold of dimension 4k - 1 to a quaternionic manifold N of dimension 4n . Suppose that, for any x∈M, the quaternionic vector subspace of Tφ(x)N spanned by [formula] has dimension 4k . Then φ extends to a germ unique quaternionic immersion from a quaternionic manifold, of dimension 4k , to N; in particular, the pull-back of any quaternionic connection on N preserves the quaternionic vector bundle generated by TM.

Let ZM and ZN be the twistor spaces of M and N, respectively. By [\cite=AndFre] , in an open neighbourhood U of each point of ZM there exists a complex manifold ZU, with [formula], containing U as a CR submanifold. Moreover, we may suppose that any CR function on U can be locally (and uniquely) extended to a holomorphic function on ZU (use [\cite=KoNo] to show that [\cite=Bog] can be applied; cf. [\cite=LeB-CR_twistors] ). But this is sufficient for the proof of the global embeddability theorem [\cite=AndFre] to work, thus, showing that there exists a complex manifold Z, with [formula], which contain ZM as an embedded CR submanifold. Consequently, also Theorem [\ref=thm:cr_q_maps] extends to this setting.
