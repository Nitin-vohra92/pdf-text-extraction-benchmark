Distribution law for twin primes amongst naturals

Introduction

In 1923, Hardy and Littlewood proposed a hypothesis for the distribution of twin primes on the interval (1,x) [\cite=HL]:

[formula]

Later on, the following expression was put forward [\cite=Luv]:

[formula]

The asymptotic representations ([\ref=eqn1]) and ([\ref=eqn2]) of the very important function π2(x) are too complicated to be used in practice. In this article I propose a new law for the distribution of twin primes among the naturals in the form of a much simpler π2(x), based on composition with the function π(x).

Results

Recall that π(x) [formula] is the number of primes (twin primes) not larger than x. The following hypothesis is proposed for the distribution of twin primes in the set of all naturals: Table [\ref=tbl1] gives some values of the functions π2(x) and [formula] for [formula]. The values of π2(x) were computed according to Lehmer's tables [\cite=Lehmer]. From the results in Table [\ref=tbl1] it is safe to say that the ratio of π2(x) to [formula] is either exactly one or differs from unity by some negligibly small amount. Next, we will require the upper and lower bounds for π(x) given in [\cite=Trost]:

[formula]

For all [formula] for which ([\ref=eqn4]) holds, we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

The function f(x) = x /  ln x is monotonically increasing for [formula]. From ([\ref=eqn4]) we have

[formula]

If we now consider the expression [formula] as a function of π(x), we can see it is also monotonically increasing. In our case, [formula] as [formula] (by theorem requirements). Taking this into consideration and using the right-hand side of inequality ([\ref=eqn4])

[formula]

Similarly, by using the left-hand side of inequality ([\ref=eqn4]) we obtain the lower bound:

[formula]

Thus, from ([\ref=eqn6]) we have

[formula]

precisely inequality ([\ref=eqn5]), as required.

In Table [\ref=tbl2] we check inequality ([\ref=eqn5]) for several values of x. Next let us look at the density of twin primes among the primes.

Almost all primes are not twins, so

[formula]

Assume that hypothesis ([\ref=eqn3]) is true. Then, denoting y = π(x), we have

[formula]

We can find an upper bound for π(y) / y by the sieve method, taking the set [formula] to contain no repeated values. Let φ(y,r) be the number of naturals no larger than y and not divisible by any of the first r primes [formula]. Then

[formula]

where μ(d) is the Mobius function and [formula] means all d not divisible by P1 to Pr. It is clear that

[formula]

We next drop the floor operator in ([\ref=eqn8]), and note that there are 2r terms being summed. This means that the resulting expression has an error no larger than 2r, and by ([\ref=eqn9]) we subsequently get

[formula]

because r < Pr < 2r. Furthermore, from the inequality

[formula]

we find

[formula]

Choose r = c ln y, [formula]. Then 2r < y and

[formula]

where [formula]. Dividing through by y, we get

[formula]

As y  →    ∞  , the right-hand side of the above goes to zero, which implies the validity of equation ([\ref=eqn7]).

Since we know that π(x) = o(x), from Theorem [\ref=thm2] it follows that π2(x) = o(x). In fact,

[formula]

Next, we move on to construct an empirical function for the law of distribution of twin primes. Denote by ηP the density of primes in the reals, and by ηPP the density of twin primes in the primes, i.e. ηP  =  π(x) / x and ηPP  =  π2(x) / π(x). Based on π(x) = o(x) and ([\ref=eqn7]), the densities ηP and ηPP go to zero as x  →    ∞  , but the ratio

[formula]

remains bounded in a well-defined, constant interval (see Table [\ref=tbl3]). We can obtain a rough estimate of an upper bound for h > 0; for this we need the inequality π(x) > x /  ln x and the right-hand side of ([\ref=eqn5]). We get

[formula]

Thus, 0 < h < 5.12. This fact allows one to construct an empirical function [formula] for the number of twin primes on (2,x). As is evident from Table [\ref=tbl3], [formula] defined below is rather accurate. We obtain [formula], leading to

[formula]

where [formula] - the mean value of h for [formula] and we round the right-hand side of ([\ref=eqn11]) to the nearest integer. In Table [\ref=tbl3] I test the accuracy of [formula] for [formula]. Nevertheless, ([\ref=eqn11]) is applicable for [formula], too. For example, there are 183,728 twin primes less than or equal to [formula], while [formula] which gives a relative error of δ = 0.0014 (see Table [\ref=tbl3]).
