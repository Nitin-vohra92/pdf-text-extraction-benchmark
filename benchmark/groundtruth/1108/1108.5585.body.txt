The distribution of second degrees in the Bollobás-Riordan random graph model

Proof [formula]

Introduction

In this paper we consider some properties of random graphs. The standard random graph model [formula] was introduced by Erds and Rényi in [\cite=ER]. In this model we randomly choose one graph from all graphs with n vertices and m edges. The similar model [formula] was suggested by Gilbert in [\cite=G]. Here n vertices are joined independently with probability 0 < p < 1. Many papers deal with the classical models. Main results can be found in [\cite=B], [\cite=K], [\cite=JLR].

Recently there has been interest in modeling complex real-world networks. Real structures differ from standard random graphs. One of the main characteristics of random graphs is their degree sequence. In many real-world structures the degree sequence has a power law distribution. Standard random graph models do not have this property. So Barabási and Albert suggested a new model in [\cite=BA]. Then Bollobás and Riordan gave more precise definition of this model. Many models of real-world networks and main results can be found in [\cite=Res].

This paper deals with the Bollobás-Riordan model. Now let us describe this model. Let n be a number of vertices in our graph and m be a fixed parameter. We begin with the case m = 1. We inductively construct a random graph Gn1. Start with G11 the graph with one vertex and one loop. Similarly we can start with G01 the graph with no vertices. Assume that we already constructed the graph Gt - 11. At the next step we add one vertex t and one edge between vertices t and i, where i is chosen randomly with

[formula]

Here dGt1(s) is the degree of the vertex s in Gt1. By d(s) denote the degree of s in the graph Gn1. In other words, the probability that a new vertex will be connected to the vertex i is proportional to the current degree of i. Therefore this process is said to be preferential attachment. To obtain Gnm with m > 1 we construct Gmn1. Then we identify the vertices [formula] to form the first vertex; we identify the vertices [formula] to form the second vertex; and so on. After this procedure, edges from Gn1 connect "big" vertices in Gnm. Let [formula] be the probability space of constructed graphs.

Many papers deal with the Bollobás-Riordan model. The diameter of this random graph was considered in [\cite=BR1]. In [\cite=BR2] Bollobás and Riordan proved that the degree sequence has a power law distribution.

Recently Grechnikov substantially improved Theorem 1 (see [\cite=Gr]).

In this paper we consider second degrees of vertices in Gnm. We estimate the expectation of the number of vertices with second degree equal to d. Also we prove a concentration result. This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we give main definitions and results. In section 3 we prove all theorems.

Definitions and results

In this paper we study the random graph Gn1. When we write ij∈Gn1 we mean that Gn1 has the edge ij; when we write t∈Gn1 we simply mean that t is a vertex of Gn1. Given a vertex t∈Gn1 we say that the second degree of the vertex t is

[formula]

In other words, the second degree of t is the number of edges adjacent to the neighbors of t except for the edges adjacent to the vertex t.

Let M1n(d) be the expectation of the number of vertices with degree d in Gn1:

[formula]

By Xn(d) denote the number of vertices with second degree d in Gn1. By definition, put [formula].

The aim of this paper is to prove the following results.

This is a concentration result which means that the distribution of second degrees does also obey (asymptotically) a power law.

To prove Theorem 2, we need the following definition. Let Nn(l,k) be the number of vertices in Gn1 with degree l, with second degree k, and without loops:

[formula]

We shall prove the following theorem.

We shall use the following lemmas to prove these theorems.

Denote by Pn(l,k) the number of vertices in Gn1 with a loop, with degree l, and with second degree k.

The next section is organized as follows. First we prove Theorem 4 and Theorem 2; then we prove the lemmas. Finally we give a proof of Theorem 3.

Proofs

Proof of Theorem 4

From the definition of Gn1 it follows that Nn(l,0)  =  Nn(0,k) = 0. Indeed, since we have no vertices of degree 0, we see that Nn(0,k) = 0. Since vertices with loops are not counted in Nn(l,k), it follows that we have no vertices of second degree 0 and Nn(l,0) = 0. Therefore we have [formula].

Let us prove that [formula]. The proof is by induction on k. For k = 0 there is nothing to prove. Now assume that for j < k we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

Denote by Ni(l) the number of vertices with degree l in Gi1.

We need some additional notation. Let X be a function on n (the number of vertices), l (the first degree we are interested in), k (the second degree we are interested in); then denote by θ1(X), θ2(X), θ3(X) [formula] some functions on n, l, k such that |θi(X)|  <  X.

Obviously, [formula]. For [formula] we have

[formula]

Let us explain this equality. Suppose we have Gi1. We add one vertex and one edge. There are Ni(1,k) vertices with degree 1 and with second degree k in Gi1. The probability that we "spoil" one of these vertices is (k + 2)  /  (2i + 1). Also we have Ni(1,k - 1) vertices with degree 1 and with second degree k - 1. The probability that one of these vertices has degree 1 and second degree k in Gi + 11 is k / (2i + 1). Finally, with probability equal to kNi(k) / (2i + 1) the vertex i + 1 has necessary degrees in Gi + 11.

Using ([\ref=l=1]), Lemma 1, and inductive assumption we get

[formula]

[formula]

Let us introduce some notation:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Using this notation, we have

[formula]

Let us prove the following equality by induction on n:

[formula]

For n = 1 we have [formula]. Since we have the condition |θ(1,1,k)| < (k + 1)2, we can take θ(1,1,k)  =   - 1.

Now put t = k + 1. This is needed for the sequel. Assume that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

If [formula] and [formula], then

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

In this case, we can put [formula].

If [formula] and [formula], then we do not have enough edges in Gi1 and [formula]. In this case, we can put θ(i + 1,l,k)  =   - 1.

We consider the case 2i - t =  - 1 later.

We get

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

This completes the proof for [formula].

Consider the case l,k > 1. Assume that for all i < l,j < k we have [formula]. Put t  =  2l + k - 1. Obviously, [formula]. For [formula] we have

[formula]

[formula]

Introduce some notation:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

We have

[formula]

It remains to prove the following statement by induction on n:

[formula]

The proof is the same as in the case of l = 1. In this case we have

[formula]

Now we need to consider only the case 2i - t =  - 1. We need to show that [formula]. We have 2(i + 1)  =  2l  +  k. In our graph Gi + 11 we have i + 1 edges. Therefore the sum of all degrees is equal to 2l + k. Suppose we have at least one vertex with degree l and second degree k. We do not count vertices with a loop in Ni + 1(l,k). Consequently l edges go out from this vertex. And there are k / 2 edges between the neighbors of our vertex. And we have no other edges. Hence our vertex is joined to all other vertices in Gi + 11. So l  =  i. Thus k = 2. It follows that we consider the vertex 2. And there is one edge from the vertex 2 to the vertex 1; also edges from the vertices [formula] go to the vertex 2. So, there is only one graph with [formula]. This graph has only one vertex with degree l and second degree k. Therefore the probability of this graph is equal to [formula]. We have [formula].

Recall that l = i and k = 2. Now we must only prove that

[formula]

Let us prove the inequality

[formula]

It follows from the definition of c(l,k) that

[formula]

[formula]

Obviously, [formula]. Let us obtain the following upper bound:

[formula]

This completes the proof.

Proof of Theorem 2

From Theorem 4 we have the constants c(l,k). Imagine that we have a table with c(l,k), where l is the number of a row and k is the number of a column. The sum of all numbers in the table is equal to 1. The sum of numbers in l-th row is equal to [formula]. It can easily be checked using the definition of c(l,k). But we need to calculate M2n(k), so we are interested in the sum of all numbers in k-th column. More precisely,

[formula]

First we estimate [formula]. Recall that

[formula]

Note that there exists a function [formula] such that for all [formula] and [formula] the inequality

[formula]

holds. Indeed, the case of k = 0 is obvious with C(k) = 0. In the case of [formula] we define C(k) so that [formula] and ([\ref=cbound]) holds for l = k. We have

[formula]

[formula]

This proves ([\ref=cbound]).

In particular, the series [formula] converges for all N and k.

Let us make some transformations:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Put [formula]. Then x0 = 0 and for [formula] we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Put [formula]. Then

[formula]

Make some transformations:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

For [formula] we have

[formula]

Let [formula]. Then for [formula]

[formula]

Make similar transformations

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Since [formula], we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Finally, [formula], so [formula] and

[formula]

[formula]

Now we can estimate M2n(k):

[formula]

The first sum:

[formula]

The second sum:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The third sum:

[formula]

Recall that

[formula]

For the other values of l and k we have p(l,k)  =  0. We can estimate p(l,k):

[formula]

Indeed, it is easy to check that the function [formula] follows the recurrent relation. So when l = 2 and k = 0 we use the fact that [formula], and then we proceed by induction. Hence the series [formula] converges. In other words, [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

This completes the proof.

Now we must only prove Lemma 1 and Lemma 2.

Proof of Lemma 1

In [\cite=BR2] Bollobás and Riordan computed the expectation of the number of vertices with degree d. But they only looked at [formula] and proved that

[formula]

We are interested in [formula] for any d. In addition, we want to estimate |(n,d)|. Therefore we compute M1n(d) in this paper.

The proof is by induction on d. First we need to consider 2 cases: d  =  1 and d  =  2.

Consider the case d = 1. Obviously, M10(1)  =  0. Assume that [formula]. Then

[formula]

[formula]

Put [formula]. Note that

[formula]

This completes the proof for d = 1.

The case d = 2 is somewhat different. Obviously, M10(2)  =  0. Suppose [formula]. Then

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Put

[formula]

Note that (i,1) < 0. Hence

[formula]

We got necessary bounds for (i,2) and (i,1). Thus, it is easy to check that

[formula]

This completes the proof for d = 2.

Suppose [formula] and we can prove the theorem for all smaller degrees. This case is proved by induction on i. For i = 0 we have M10(d)  =  0. Assume that [formula]. Then

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

If [formula], we can put

[formula]

We obtain the following estimate:

[formula]

If [formula], we have no vertices with degree d in Gi + 11. Indeed, in Gi + 11 the sum of all degrees is 2i + 2. If d  >  2i  +  2, we obviously do not have enough edges. If d  =  2i  +  2, then it is easy to check that we can not have any vertices with degree d (d  >  2). So we can put (i + 1,d)  =   - 1. This concludes the proof.

Proof of Lemma 2

Obviously, [formula]. For all k > 0 we have [formula]. For k = 0 we have

[formula]

The rest of the proof is by induction. Consider [formula], [formula]. Suppose that for i < l and j < k we have [formula].

Trivially, P1(l,k)  =  0. It is easily shown that [formula] if 2i  +  4  <  2l + k.

If 2i  +  4  =  2l  +  k and [formula], then l  =  i + 2 and k  =  0. And we have only one graph with [formula]. Arguing as in the end of Section 3.1, we see that the probability of this graph is [formula]. From the recurrent relation we have [formula]. In our case we get

[formula]

If [formula], then

[formula]

Using the recurrent relation for p(l,k) and induction on i it is easy to prove that [formula]. This concludes the proof of Lemma 2.

Proof of Theorem 3

This proof is similar to the proof given in [\cite=BR2]. But our case is more complicated. We need the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality (see [\cite=A]):

Suppose we are given an ε  >  0. Fix [formula] and k: [formula]. Consider the random variables [formula], [formula]. Let us explain the notation [formula]. We construct the graph [formula] by induction. For any [formula] there exists a unique [formula] such that Gn1 is obtained from Gt1. So [formula] is the expectation of the number of vertices with second degree k in Gn1 if at the step t we have the graph Gt1.

Note that [formula] and Xn(k)  =  Xn(k). From the definition of Gn1 it follows that Xi(k) is a martingale.

We will prove below that for any [formula]

[formula]

Theorem 3 follows from this statement immediately. Put c  =  10  k ln n. Then from Azuma-Hoeffding inequality it follows that

[formula]

If [formula], then the value of n / k2 is considerably greater than [formula]. This means that we have [formula]. This is exactly what we need.

It remains to estimate the quantity |Xi(k)  -  Xi - 1(k)|. The proof is by a direct calculation.

Fix [formula] and some graph Gi - 11. Note that

[formula]

Put [formula], [formula]. We need to estimate the difference [formula].

Using the notation Nn(l,k) and Pn(l,k) from Section 2, we get

[formula]

[formula]

For [formula] put

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

[formula]

Let us estimate this double sum.

First suppose that n = i. Fix Gi - 11. Graphs Ĝi1 and i1 are obtained from the graph Gi - 11. We add the vertex i and one edge i or i, respectively. New edge changes only the degree of [formula] or [formula] and the second degree of neighbors of [formula] or [formula], respectively. Consider Ĝi1. Fix l and [formula]. We are interested in measuring the growth of the number of vertices with degree l and second degree j at the step i. First i can become a vertex of second degree j with [formula]. Secondly the vertex [formula] can become a vertex of second degree j with [formula]. Thirdly the second degree of neighbors of [formula] increases. If [formula] has at least k + 1 neighbors in Gi - 11, then after the step i these vertices have second degree bigger than k and we do not count them. If [formula] has at most k neighbors in Gi - 11, then at most k vertices change their second degrees at the step i. Arguing as above, we consider i1. We are interested in measuring the decrease of the values Ni - 1(l,j) and Pi - 1(l,j). First [formula] has new degree after the step i. Secondly some neighbors of [formula] can have second degree [formula] in Gi - 11 (so the number of the neighbors of [formula] in Gi - 11 is not bigger than k + 1). Let us sum all the just-mentioned numbers. We have

[formula]

The case n = i is complete. Now consider t: [formula]. Note that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

We obtained the same equalities in proofs of Theorem 4, Lemma 1, and Lemma 2. Replace Gi1 by Ĝi1 or i1 in these equalities. Substracting the equalities with i1 from the equalities with Ĝi1 and using the inequality [formula], we get

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Now we can estimate the sum

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

It remains to estimate the sum [formula]. Note that for any [formula] we have [formula]. It is obvious for t = i (when we add a new vertex i, we change only the degree of [formula] or [formula]). If t + 1 > i, then

[formula]

In other words, [formula] is not increasing when t is growing.

So we get

[formula]

Thus we have

[formula]

[formula]

This concludes the proof of Theorem 3.
