Braidings on the category of bimodules, Azumaya algebras and epimorphisms of rings

Introduction

Braided monoidal categories play a key role in several areas of mathematics like quantum groups, noncommutative geometry, knot theory, quantum field theory and 3-manifolds. It is well-known that the category [formula] of bimodules over an algebra A over a commutative ring k is monoidal. The aim of this paper is to give an answer to the following natural question: given an algebra A, describe all braidings on [formula]. Besides the purely categorical significance this problem is also relevant in noncommutative geometry where braidings on [formula] are used to develop the theory of wedge products of differential forms or connections on bimodules. The question is not as obvious as it seems: a first attempt might be to use the switch map to define the braiding, but this is not well-defined, even in the case when A is a commutative algebra. However, there are non-trivial examples of braidings on the category of bimodules. For example, let A = Mn(k) be a matrix algebra; then [formula] given by the formula

[formula]

is a braiding on the category of A-bimodules (see Example [\ref=ex:2.5] for full detail). A first general result is Theorem [\ref=th:1.1], stating that braidings on the category of A-bimodules are in bijective correspondence with canonical R-matrices, these are invertible elements R in the threefold tensor product [formula], satisfying a list of axioms. In this situation, we will say that (A,R) is an algebra with a canonical R-matrix. Actually, this result is inspired by a classical result of Hopf algebras: braidings on the category of (left) modules over a bialgebra H are in one-to-one correspondence with quasitriangular structures on H, these are elements R in the two-fold tensor product [formula] satisfying certain properties. We refer to [\cite=Montgomery] for detail. The next step is to reduce the list of axioms to two equations, a centralizing condition and a normalizing condition, and then we can prove in Theorem [\ref=th:2.1] that all braidings on a category of bimodules are symmetries. In the situation where A is commutative, we have a complete classification: A admits a canonical R-matrix R if and only if k  →  A is an epimorphism in the category of rings, and then R is trivial, see Proposition [\ref=pr:1.2]. The invariants functor [formula] has a left adjoint [formula]. We prove that G is a separable functor [\cite=NastasescuVV89] [\cite=Rafael] if and only if G is fully faithful and this implies that A admits a canonical R-matrix. The converse property also holds if A is free as a k-module, and then the braiding on the category of A-bimodules is unique, cf. Theorem [\ref=th:2.2]. Azumaya algebras were introduced in [\cite=AG] under the name central separable algebras; a more restrictive class was considered earlier by Azumaya in [\cite=Az]. Azumaya algebras are the proper generalization of central simple algebras to commutative rings. The Brauer group consists of the set of Morita equivalence classes of Azumaya algebras. There exists a large literature on Azumaya algebras and the Brauer group, see for example the reference list in [\cite=stef]. A is an Azumaya algebra if and only if G is an equivalence of categories, and then G is separable. Therefore the category of bimodules over an Azumaya algebra is braided monoidal, that is any Azumaya algebra admits a canonical R-matrix. R can be described explicitly in the cases where A is a matrix algebra or a quaternion algebra, see Examples [\ref=ex:2.5] and [\ref=ex:2.6]. Not every algebra with a canonical R-matrix is Azumaya; for example [formula] is not a [formula]-Azumaya algebra, but [formula] is a canonical R-matrix, since [formula] is an epimorphism of rings. Thus algebras with a canonical R-matrix can be viewed as generalizations of Azumaya algebras. Applying Theorem [\ref=th:2.2] to finite dimensional algebras over fields, we obtain a new characterization of central simple algebras, namely central simple algebras are the finite dimensional algebras admitting a canonical R-matrix. As a final application, we construct a simultaneous solution of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation and the braid equation from any canonical R-matrix, see Theorem [\ref=th:qybe].

Preliminary

Azumaya algebras

Let k be a commutative ring and A a k-algebra. Unadorned [formula] means [formula]. [formula] is the k-linear category of A-bimodules. It is well-known that we have a pair of adjoint functors (F,G) between the category of k-modules Mk and the category of A-bimodules [formula]. For a k-module N, [formula], with A-bimodule structure [formula], for all a, b, c∈A and n∈N. For an A-bimodule M, [formula]. The unit η and the counit ε of the adjoint pair (F,G) are given by the formulas

[formula]

for all n∈N, a∈A and m∈MA. Recall that A is an Azumaya algebra if A is faithfully projective as a k-module, that is, A is finitely generated, projective and faithful, and the algebra map

[formula]

is an isomorphism. Azumaya algebras can be characterized in several ways; perhaps the most natural characterization is the following: A is an Azumaya algebra if and only if the adjoint pair (F,G) is a pair of inverse equivalences, see [\cite=KO]. Another characterization is that A is central and separable as a k-algebra.

Separable functors

Recall from [\cite=NastasescuVV89] that a covariant functor F: C  →  D is called separable if the natural transformation

[formula]

splits, that is, there is a natural transformation

[formula]

such that [formula] is the identity natural transformation. Rafael's Theorem [\cite=Rafael] states that the left adjoint F in an adjoint pair of functors (F,G) is separable if and only if the unit of the adjunction η:1C  →  GF splits; the right adjoint G is separable if and only if the counit ε:FG  →  1D cosplits, that is, there exists a natural transformation ζ:1D  →  FG such that [formula] is the identity natural transformation. A detailed study of separable functors can be found in [\cite=book].

Braided monoidal categories

A monoidal category [formula] consists of a category C, a functor [formula], called the tensor product, an object I∈C called the unit object, and natural isomorphisms [formula] (the associativity constraint), [formula] (the left unit constraint) and [formula] (the right unit constraint). a, l and r have to satisfy certain coherence conditions, we refer to [\cite=K] for a detailed discussion. C is called strict if a, l and r are the identities on C. McLane's Coherence Theorem asserts that every monoidal category is monoidal equivalent to a strict one, see [\cite=K]. The categories that we will consider are not strict, but they can be treated as if they were strict. Let τ: C  ×  C  →  C  ×  C be the flip functor. A prebraiding on C is a natural transformation [formula] satisfying the following equations, for all U,V,W∈C:

[formula]

c is called a braiding if it is a natural isomorphism. c is called a symmetry if c- 1U,V = cV,U, for all U,V∈C. We refer to [\cite=K] for more detail.

Braidings on the category of bimodules

Let A be an algebra over a commutative ring k and [formula] the monoidal category of A-bimodules. A(n) will be a shorter notation for the n-fold tensor product [formula], where [formula]. An element R∈A(3) will be denoted by [formula], where summation is implicitly understood. Our first aim is to investigate braidings on [formula].

Let A be a k-algebra. Then there is a bijective correspondence between the class of all braidings c on [formula] and the set of all invertible elements [formula] satisfying the following conditions, for all a∈A:

[formula]

where [formula]. Under the above correspondence the braiding c corresponding to R is given by the formula

[formula]

for all M, [formula], m∈M and n∈N. An invertible element R∈A(3) satisfying ([\ref=eq:1.1.2])-([\ref=eq:1.1.6]) is called a canonical R-matrix and (A,R) is called an algebra with a canonical R-matrix.

A(2) is an A-bimodule via the usual actions [formula], for all a, b, x, y∈A. Let [formula] be a braiding on [formula]. For each [formula], we have an A-bimodule isomorphism [formula], that is natural in M and N. Now consider

[formula]

and let [formula]. c is completely determined by R. For [formula], m∈M and n∈N, we consider the A-bimodule maps fm: A(2)  →  M and gn: A(2)  →  N given by the formulas [formula] and [formula]. From the naturality of c, it follows that

[formula]

([\ref=eq:1.1.1]) follows after we evaluate this formula at [formula]. Obviously [formula]. Furthermore, [formula] and [formula] since cM,N is a bimodule map. If we write these three formulas down in the case where M = N = A(2), and [formula], then we obtain ([\ref=eq:1.1.2]-[\ref=eq:1.1.4]). c satisfies the two triangle equalities

[formula]

The first equality is equivalent to

[formula]

for all m∈M, n∈N and p∈P. If we take M = N = P = A(2) and [formula], then we find that [formula]. Applying ([\ref=eq:1.1.4]), we find that ([\ref=eq:1.1.5]) holds. In a similar way, the second triangle equality implies ([\ref=eq:1.1.6]). We can apply the same arguments to the inverse braiding c- 1. We set [formula]. Then we have that

[formula]

Now take [formula]. Then we find

[formula]

In a similar way, we have that [formula], and it follows that [formula] is the inverse of [formula]. Conversely, assume that R∈A(3) is invertible and satisfies ([\ref=eq:1.1.2]-[\ref=eq:1.1.6]). Then we define c using ([\ref=eq:1.1.1]). Straightforward computations show that c is a braiding on [formula].

Let c be a braiding on [formula] and R the corresponding canonical R-matrix. Then c is a symmetry, if and only if S  =  R, this means that

[formula]

that is, [formula]. The next theorem shows that the list of equations satisfied by an R-matrix from Theorem [\ref=th:1.1] can be reduced to two equations and furthermore, we prove that all braidings on the category of A-bimodules are symmetries.

Let A be a k-algebra. Then there is a bijection between the set of canonical R-matrices and the set of all elements R∈A(3) satisfying ([\ref=eq:1.1.4]) and the normalizing condition

[formula]

Furthermore, R is invariant under cyclic permutation of the tensor factors,

[formula]

and we have the additional normalizing condition

[formula]

In particular, every braiding on [formula] is a symmetry.

Let R be an R-matrix as in Theorem [\ref=th:1.1], i.e. R is invertible and satisfies ([\ref=eq:1.1.2]-[\ref=eq:1.1.6]). Multiplying the second and the third tensor factor in ([\ref=eq:1.1.6]), we find that [formula]. From the fact that R is invertible, it follows that [formula], and the first normalizing condition of ([\ref=eq:2.1.2]) follows after we multiply the first two tensor factors. On the other hand, if we apply the flip map on the last two positions in ([\ref=eq:1.1.5]) we obtain that [formula]. Multiplying the last two positions we obtain:

[formula]

As R is invertible it follows that [formula], as needed. Conversely, assume now that R satisfies ([\ref=eq:1.1.4]) and ([\ref=eq:2.1.2]). We will show that R is a canonical R-matrix satisfying ([\ref=eq:2.1.1]) and hence from the observations preceding Theorem [\ref=th:2.1] we obtain that the braiding c corresponding to R is a symmetry. First we show that R is invariant under cyclic permutation of the tensor factors.

[formula]

This implies immediately that the central conditions ([\ref=eq:1.1.2]-[\ref=eq:1.1.3]) are also satisfied. Next we show that ([\ref=eq:1.1.5]-[\ref=eq:1.1.6]) are satisfied.

[formula]

Finally, we prove that ([\ref=eq:2.1.1]) holds since

[formula]

and the proof is finished.

The commutative case is completely classified by the following result.

Let A be a k-algebra. Then:

If a monomial [formula] is a canonical R-matrix, then it is equal to [formula].

[formula] is a canonical R-matrix if and only if uA: k  →  A is an epimorphism of rings.

If A is commutative, then (A,R) is an algebra with a canonical R-matrix if and only if [formula] and uA:k  →  A is an epimorphism of rings.

1. Let [formula] be a canonical R-matrix. From ([\ref=eq:1.1.5]-[\ref=eq:1.1.6]), it follows that

[formula]

Since R is invertible, this implies that

[formula]

and, multiplying tensor factors, we find that [formula]. It then follows that yxz = xzy = 1, hence y is invertible with y- 1 = xz. Finally

[formula]

2. If [formula], then the three centralizing conditions ([\ref=eq:1.1.2]-[\ref=eq:1.1.4]) are equivalent to [formula], for all a∈A, which is equivalent to uA: k  →  A being an epimorphism of rings, see [\cite=silver]. 3. Assume that (A,R) is an algebra with a canonical R-matrix. Then:

[formula]

At the third step, we used the fact that A is commutative. From the fact that R is invertible, it follows that [formula] and [formula]. The rest of the proof follows from 2.

1. The notion of quasi-triangular bialgebroid was introduced in [\cite=Donin]. Quasi-triangular structures on a bialgebroid are given by universal R-matrices, see [\cite=Donin] and [\cite=Bohm], and correspond bijectively to braidings on the category of modules over the bialgebroid [\cite=Bohm]. It is well-known that Ae is an A-bialgebroid, with the Sweedler canonical coring as underlying coring, and A-bimodules are left Ae-modules. Comparing our Theorem [\ref=th:1.1] with the (left handed) version of [\cite=Bohm] yields that canonical R-matrices for A correspond bijectively to universal R-matrices for the canonical bialgebroid Ae. This leads to an alternative proof of Theorem [\ref=th:1.1], if we identify the R-matrices from [\cite=Donin] with our R-matrices. This, however, is more complicated than the straightforward proof that we presented, that also has the advantage that it is self-contained and avoids all technicalities on bialgebroids.

2. ([\ref=eq:1.1.5]-[\ref=eq:1.1.6]) can be rewritten as R124  =  R123R134 and R134  =  R124R234 in the algebra A(4).

3. It follows from Proposition [\ref=pr:1.2] that there is only one braiding on the category of (left) k-modules, namely the one given by the usual switch map.

Before we state our next main result Theorem [\ref=th:2.2], we need a technical Lemma. If [formula], then [formula] is a [formula]-bimodule, and we can consider

[formula]

If M = A(2), then [formula] is the set of elements R∈A(3) satisfying ([\ref=eq:1.1.4]). We have a map [formula], [formula].

Let M be an A-bimodule. The map αM is injective if A is flat as a k-module, and bijective if A is free as a k-module.

If A is flat, then [formula] is injective, and then αM is also injective. Assume that A is free as a k-module, and let {ej ~ | ~ j∈I} be a free basis of A. Assume that [formula]. For all i, we can write [formula], for some αji∈k. Then [formula]. Now

[formula]

hence [formula], for all j∈I, and [formula]. We conclude that [formula], and this shows that αM is surjective.

In our next result we assume A to be flat over k. Hence the map αA(2) is injective and this will allows us to identify the elements in [formula] with the elements in [formula] satisfying ([\ref=eq:1.1.4]).

Let A be a flat k-algebra and consider the conditions:

(F,G) is a pair of inverse equivalences, that is, A is an Azumaya algebra;

The functor [formula] is fully faithful;

the functor [formula] is separable;

there exists [formula] such that [formula];

there exists a unique [formula] such that [formula];

there exists a braiding on [formula], that is, there exists R∈A(3) such that (A,R) is an algebra with a canonical R-matrix.

Then (1)  ⇒  (2)  ⇔  (3)  ⇔  (4)  ⇔  (5)  ⇒  (6). If A is central, then (2)  ⇒  (1). If A is free as a k-module, then (6)  ⇒  (5), and in this case the braiding on [formula] is unique. If k is a field, and A is finite dimensional, then (6)  ⇒  (1), and all six assertions are equivalent.

[formula], (2)  ⇒  (3) and (5)  ⇒  (4) are trivial. [formula]. If G is separable, then we have a natural transformation ζ: 1  ⇒  FG such that [formula], for all [formula]. Now let [formula]. Then [formula]. The natural transformation ζ is completely determined by R. For an A-bimodule M and m∈M, we define fm as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:1.1]. From the naturality of ζ, it follows that the diagram

[formula]

commutes. Evaluating the diagram at [formula], we find that

[formula]

[formula]. Write [formula], with ai∈A and [formula]. Then [formula], thus R satisfies ([\ref=eq:2.1.2]). Moreover, as [formula] it follows that R also satisfies ([\ref=eq:1.1.4]). Then using Theorem [\ref=th:2.1] we obtain that R is a canonical R-matrix and it determines a braiding on [formula].

[formula]. Given [formula] satisfying [formula], we define ζ using ([\ref=eq:2.2.1]). It follows immediately that [formula]. We have seen in the proof of [formula] that ([\ref=eq:1.1.3]) and ([\ref=eq:2.1.4]) are satisfied. For ai∈A and mi∈MA, we then compute

[formula]

This shows that ε is a natural transformation with inverse ζ, and G is fully faithful. [formula]. We have already seen that 2) implies 4), and this shows that R exists. If G is fully faithful, then εM is invertible, for all [formula]. If [formula] satisfies [formula], then [formula], hence [formula]. [formula]. From (5), it follows that there exists [formula] such that [formula], see Theorem [\ref=th:2.1]. αA(2) is bijective, see Lemma [\ref=le:free], hence [formula] satisfies (3). The uniqueness of R follows from (4). [formula]. Assume that A is central. From (4), it follows that [formula] is surjective, and then it follows from [\cite=AG] that A is separable over Z(A) = k. Thus A is central separable, and therefore Azumaya. (6)  ⇒  (1). If k is a field, then A is free, so (6) implies (5), and, a fortiori, (2). Then [formula] is an isomorphism of A-bimodules, and therefore also of vector spaces. A count of dimensions shows that  dimk(Z(A))  =   dimk(AA)  =  1, so that Z(A)  =  k1A, and A is central, and then (1) follows from (2).

In particular, applying Theorem [\ref=th:2.2] for finite dimensional algebras over fields we obtain the following surprising characterization of central simple algebras:

For a finite dimensional algebra A over a field k, the following assertions are equivalent:

A is a central simple algebra;

there exists a (unique) braiding on [formula];

there exists a (unique) invertible element [formula] satisfying the conditions [formula] and [formula], for all a∈A.

For any k-algebra A, the functor [formula] is strong monoidal. Indeed, for any N,N'∈Mk, we have natural isomorphisms [formula] and

[formula]

satisfying all the necessary axioms, see [\cite=K].

Let (A,R) be an algebra with a canonical R-matrix. Then the functor [formula] preserves the symmetry.

We have to show that the following diagram commutes

[formula]

Here [formula] is the usual switch map. For a,b∈A, n∈N and n'∈N', we compute

[formula]

and the proof is finished.

If A is an Azumaya algebra, then it follows from Theorem [\ref=th:2.2] that we have a symmetry on the category of A-bimodules [formula]. In Examples [\ref=ex:2.5] and [\ref=ex:2.6], we give explicit formulas for R in the case where A is a matrix ring or a quaternion algebra; in both cases A is free, so that the canonical R-matrix is unique.

Let A  =  Mn(k) be a matrix algebra. Then the R-matrix for Mn(k) if given by

[formula]

where eij is the elementary matrix with 1 in the (i,j)-position and 0 elsewhere. Indeed, for all indices i, j, p, q, we have

[formula]

hence [formula] and [formula]. Finally

[formula]

as needed.

Let K be a commutative ring, such that 2 is invertible in K, and take two invertible elements a,b∈K. The generalized quaternion algebra [formula] is the free K-module with basis {1,i,j,k} and multiplication defined by

[formula]

It is well-known that A is an Azumaya algebra. The corresponding R-matrix is

[formula]

It is easy to show that R satisfies ([\ref=eq:1.1.4]) and ([\ref=eq:2.1.2]). Indeed,

[formula]

proving the first normalization from ([\ref=eq:2.1.2]); the second one follows in a similar manner. An elementary computation shows that [formula], for x = i,j,k, and this proves ([\ref=eq:1.1.4]).

Any Azumaya algebra A admits a canonical R-matrix. The converse is not true: it suffices to consider [formula] as a [formula]-algebra. Since [formula] is an epimorphism of rings, it follows from Proposition [\ref=pr:1.2] that [formula] is braided and it is obvious that [formula] is not a [formula]-Azumaya algebra.

Let (A,R), (B,S) be two algebras with a canonical R-matrix. It is straightforward to show that [formula], with [formula], is an algebra with a canonical R-matrix.

We conclude this paper with another application of canonical R-matrices: they can be applied to deform the switch map into a simultaneous solution of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation and the braid equation.

Let (A,R) be an algebra with a canonical R-matrix and V an A-bimodule. Then the map

[formula]

is a solution of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation Ω12  Ω13  Ω23  =  Ω23  Ω13  Ω12 and of the braid equation Ω12  Ω23  Ω12  =  Ω23  Ω12  Ω23. Moreover Ω3  =  Ω in End(V(2)).

Let r  =  S  =  R. Then for any v, w, t∈V we have:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Hence Ω is a solution of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. On the other hand:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus Ω is also a solution of the braid equation. Finally,

[formula]
