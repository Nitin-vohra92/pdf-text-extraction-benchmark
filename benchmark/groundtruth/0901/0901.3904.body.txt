Introduction

Manifolds with density, a new category in geometry, appeared in many ways in mathematics, such as quotients of Riemannian manifolds or as Gauss space and, and can be viewed as smooth case of Gromov's mm-spaces. A density on a Riemannian manifold Mn is a positive function eφ(x) used to weight volume and hypersurface area. Gauss space Gn is a Euclidean space with Gaussian probability density [formula] that is very interesting to probabilists. For more details about manifolds with density and some first results on Morgan's grand goal to "generalize all of Riemannian geometry to manifolds with density" we refer the reader to [\cite=mo1], [\cite=mo2], [\cite=RCBM], [\cite=Co2]. We refer especially the reader to Chapter 18 of Morgan's book Geometric Measure Theory ([\cite=mo2]), in which the author described general manifolds with density and their relationship to Perelman's proof of the Poincaré conjecture. Following Gromov ([\cite=gr1]) the natural generalization of the mean curvature of hypersufaces on a manifold with density eφ is defined as

[formula]

and therefore, the mean curvature of a surface in [formula] with density eφ is

[formula]

where H is the Euclidean mean curvature and [formula] is the normal vector field of the surface. We call Hφ the mean curvature with density or mean φ-curvature of the surface.

The literature of minimal surfaces began with Lagrange's work in 1760. Lagrange established a PDE, named after him, for the graph of a C2-function of two variables to be minimal. At that time, the only known solution of Lagrange's equation was planes. In 1776, Meusnier solved that equation with an additional assumption that the level curves were straight lines and obtained the solution of ruled minimal surface Helicoid. It is well known that, beside the trivial case of planes, helicoid is the unique (noncylindrical) ruled minimal surface (see [\cite=babo], [\cite=ca]). In 1835, Scherk solved Lagrange's equation for translation functions, i.e. functions of the type f(x,y) = g(x) + h(y) and discovered Scherk's minimal surfaces.

Often, locally a regular surface can be considered as the graph of the function

[formula]

where U is a domain in [formula] in product space [formula] In this paper, we consider ruled minimal surfaces in space with log-linear density [formula] where [formula] is the real line with log-linear density eφ. The space with log-linear density eφ is the first non-trivial case of the new category "manifolds with density" and is equivalent with the case of space with density ez as it is showed in section 2. All ruled minimal surfaces in [formula] with density ez are classified. Quite different as the classical case, it is showed that there is no noncylindrical ruled minimal surfaces and there is a family of cylindrical ruled minimal surfaces. We also consider the case of translation minimal surfaces and it is proved that, all translation minimal surfaces are rule.

All functions in this paper are assumed belong to the class C2.

Minimal surfaces in spaces with densities

From the formula of the φ-curvature, it is clear that if we understand the geometric meaning of [formula] we can discover some simple minimal surfaces in space with density. For example, in Gauss space [formula] is the distance from the origin to the tangent hyperplane at the corresponding point of the surface. So it is easy to see that in Gauss space G3 (see also [\cite=Co2])

planes have constant mean curvarture and planes passing through the origin are minimal;

spheres about the origin have constant mean curvature and the one with radius [formula]

circular cylinders with the axis passing through the origin have constant curvature and the one with radius 1 is minimal.

Let [formula] be a linear function on Euclidean space [formula]

[formula]

A linear density on [formula] is the positive function eφ(x), where [formula] It is easy to see that, the sets of points in [formula] with the linear density eφ that have the same density are hyperplanes. By a suitable changing the coodinate system we can assume that the density has the form exn and therefore we can view the space [formula] with density eφ(x) as product [formula] where [formula] is nothing but Euclidean (n - 1)-space and [formula] is a real line with density exn.

Since [formula] is the cosine of the angle between n and z-axis. By the definition of the mean φ-curvature, it is easy to see that Hφ does not change under a translation or a rotation about z-axis and moreover, we have

hyperplanes in [formula] with density exn have constant mean curvarture.

hyperplanes in [formula] with density exn that are parallel to the xn-axis have zero mean curvarture.

a circular hypercylinder with rulings parallel to xn-axis have constant mean curvature.

Ruled minimal surfaces in [formula] with linear density ez

Now we consider the problem of classifying all ruled minimal surfaces in [formula] with a linear density. Coordinates in [formula] are denoted by (x,y,z). Without loss of generality we can assume that the density is ez.

Locally, a ruled surface is given by the equation

[formula]

We can assume that |α'| = 1,  |β| = 1,  〈α',β〉 = 0.

We will focus on two cases: cylindrical ruled surface ([formula] for all v∈(c,d)) and noncylindrical ruled surfaces ( β'  ≠  0 for all v∈(c,d)). Our results show that it is no need to consider at the isolated points where β'(v) = 0.

Denote E,F,G the coefficients of the first fundamental form and e,f,g the coefficients of the second fundamental form, a direct computation yields

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Proof. Hφ = 0 if and only if

[formula]

Replace [formula] in ([\ref=6a]) we get an equality with both RHS and LHS are polynomials on the variable v. Identifying the coefficients we obtain ([\ref=3]).[formula]

The case of β'  ≠  0

From the last equation of ([\ref=3])

[formula]

we have [formula] Note that [formula] and [formula] we conclude β belongs to a plane containing the z-axis. After a rotation about the z-axis, we can assume that β = ( cos t(u),0, sin t(u)), with t'  ≠  0 and therefore, the third equality of ([\ref=3]) becomes

[formula]

From ([\ref=5]) we conclude that α' belongs to the plane {y = 0} and the curve α lies on a plane parallel to xz-plane. It is clear that, α and β satisfy system of equations ([\ref=3]). Thus,

If [formula] ruled minimal surfaces determined by ([\ref=1]) are planes parallel to the z-axis.

The case of β' = 0

Since [formula] and  a2 + b2 + c2 = 1, system ([\ref=3]) becomes

[formula]

The first equation of ([\ref=7]) implies

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

or

[formula]

Since the mean φ- curvarture does not change under a rotation about z-axis, we can assume a = 0. So we have

[formula]

Because b2 = 1 - c2,

[formula]

Suppose that α = (x(u),y(u),z(u)), then ([\ref=8a]) is equivalent to the following system of equations

[formula]

We treat the two special case [formula] and [formula] first.

If β = (0,0,  ±  1), the RHS of ([\ref=8]) equals zero. We conclude that α' and α'' are parallel, and hence α'' = 0. Thus, α is a straight line and we have

If β = (0,0,  ±  1), ruled minimal surfaces determined by equation ([\ref=1]) are planes parallel to the z-axis.

We can also treat this case by solving ([\ref=10]). In this case ([\ref=10]) becomes

[formula]

Since [formula] we get z' = 0, and hence x'' = y'' = 0. We conclude that α = (x,y,z) is a straight line lying on the plane [formula] and hence the ruled surfaces is a plane parallel to the z-axis.

If β = (0,  ±  1,0), ([\ref=10]) becomes

[formula]

Since [formula] we get y' = 0 and conclude that α lies on the plane [formula] The last equation of ([\ref=12]) gives us the solution

[formula]

[formula]

The first equation in ([\ref=12]) gives

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Note that, since the mean φ-curvature does not change under a translation, we can take the constant in the expression of x and z to be zero.

Since x'2 + y'2 + z'2 = 1, we have 4A = B2. Thus,

If β = (0,  ±  1,0), a ruled minimal surface determined by equation ([\ref=1]) has a parametric equation of the following form

[formula]

If β = (0,b,c), b,c  ≠  0 the system ([\ref=10]) becomes

[formula]

Since [formula] we get by' =  - cz' and conclude that α lies on the plane by + cz + d = 0. The last equation of ([\ref=14]) gives us the solution

[formula]

[formula]

The first equation in ([\ref=14]) gives

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Since x'2 + y'2 + z'2 = 1, we have 4A = B2. Thus,

If β = (0,b,c), b,c  ≠  0, a ruled minimal surface determined by equation ([\ref=1]) has a parametric equation of the following form

[formula]

Combining these above results, we have

Beside planes parallel to the z-axis the only cylindrical ruled minimal surfaces in [formula] with density ez are those given by ([\ref=17]).

Translation minimal surfaces in space with linear density ez.

In this section we study translation minimal surfaces in [formula] with density ez. We prove that all translation surfaces that are minimal must be ruled.

A translation surface given by

[formula]

is minimal if either g(u) = au + b or h(v) = cv + d.

Proof. A straightforward computation shows that

[formula]

We fix v = v0, and set A = 1 - h''(v0),  B = 1 + h'2(v0),  C = 1 + h'2(v0) - h''(v0). Note that B > 0 and C = B - A - 1. Thus, f must be satisfies the following equation

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Substitute g'' into ([\ref=eq1]), we get

[formula]

From equation ([\ref=eq2]), unless [formula] we must have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Substitute h'' from equation ([\ref=eq3]) into equation ([\ref=eq4]) we obtain

[formula]

Note that C = B - A - 1, we get

[formula]

Thus, [formula] and the proof is completed. [formula]

Since the role of g and h are the same, we onle need to consider translastion minimal surfaces of the following form

[formula]

A straightforward computation shows that g must be of the form
