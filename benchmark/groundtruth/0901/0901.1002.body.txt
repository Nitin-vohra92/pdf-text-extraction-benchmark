Approximation of volume-preserving homeomorphisms by volume-preserving diffeomorphisms

Introduction

A basic problem in differential topology is to determine if a given homeomorphism of a smooth manifold can be approximated uniformly by diffeomorphisms. This question dates back at least as far as [\cite=alexander:spt32]. A complete solution has been given by J. R. Munkres [\cite=munkres:osp59] [\cite=munkres:osp60] [\cite=munkres:hos65] and M. W. Hirsch [\cite=hirsch:ots63] in the form of an obstruction theory. In particular, such an approximation is always possible in dimension n  ≤  3 [\cite=munkres:osp60], but not in general, for example not necessarily in dimension 4 [\cite=donaldson:agt83]. One can then ask whether a homeomorphism which preserves volume can be uniformly approximated by diffeomorphisms (this problem is mentioned for example in [\cite=oxtoby:mph41] [\cite=oh:cmp06]), and if so, can it also be approximated by volume-preserving diffeomorphisms. The second part of this question has recently been answered in the affirmative, independently by Y.-G. Oh [\cite=oh:cmp06] and J.-C. Sikorav [\cite=sikorav:avp07]: if a volume-preserving homeomorphism can be approximated uniformly by diffeomorphisms, one can in addition impose the condition that each diffeomorphism preserves volume. This is of particular interest in dimension 2 in the context of C0-symplectic topology [\cite=oh:cmp06] [\cite=oh:ghh07] [\cite=mueller:ghl08] [\cite=mueller:ghc08], and has been the starting point of the author's interest in this question. In this short note, we give an answer to the first part of the above mentioned question, for dimensions n  ≥  5. Interesting variants of this problem have also been studied, e.g. approximation by almost everywhere diffeomorphisms [\cite=oxtoby:mph41] or in measure (in connection with Lusin's theorem) [\cite=white:aom69] [\cite=white:aom74].

Let M be a compact and oriented smooth manifold with or without boundary, of dimension n  ≥  5, and with a volume form Ω, compatible with the orientation of M. Without loss of generality assume M is connected, and the total volume of M is normalized to equal 1. One obtains a 'good' measure on M (in the terminology of [\cite=fathi:sgh80]) by integrating Ω. We assume throughout that all homeomorphisms of M are compactly supported in the interior of M. Denote by [formula] and [formula] the groups of all homeomorphisms and volume-preserving homeomorphisms of M, and by [formula] and [formula] the subgroups of all diffeomorphisms and volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of M respectively. If M is closed, equip all groups of homeomorphisms with the uniform or compact-open topology, and all groups of diffeomorphisms with the C∞-topology, unless explicitly stated otherwise. The group [formula] is metrizable by the metrics of uniform convergence or C0-convergence (uniform convergence of maps and their inverses). Only the latter is complete. However, if a sequence of homeomorphisms converges uniformly to another homeomorphism (in other words, if the limit exists), then it also converges in the C0-metric. Thus it suffices to consider uniform convergence in this paper, keeping in mind that all results stated are equally valid for the C0-metric. If M has nonempty boundary, the above groups are taken with the usual direct-limit topology.

Recall that any C1-diffeomorphism of M can be approximated uniformly by C∞-diffeomorphisms (e.g. [\cite=hirsch:dt76]). Thus in the following we do not bother about the smoothness of diffeomorphisms, and assume all diffeomorphisms in this paper are C∞. The main objective of this note is to prove the following theorem.

Let M be a compact smooth manifold with or without boundary, of dimension n  ≥  5, and with a volume form Ω as above. A volume-preserving homeomorphism [formula] can be uniformly approximated by (volume-preserving) diffeomorphisms if and only if it is homotopic to a diffeomorphism.

If a volume-preserving homeomorphism can be approximated uniformly by diffeomorphisms, it can also be approximated uniformly by volume-preserving diffeomorphisms [\cite=oh:cmp06] [\cite=sikorav:avp07]. It is therefore sufficient to prove our result for diffeomorphisms that are not necessarily volume-preserving.

The statement of the theorem can also be expressed as follows: h can be approximated uniformly by diffeomorphisms if and only if its equivalence class

[formula]

Approximation of volume-preserving homeomorphisms

We begin with a local version of Theorem [\ref=thm:approximation] due to E. H. Connell [\cite=connell:ash63] [\cite=connell:sha63], R. H. Bing [\cite=bing:she63], and Munkres [\cite=munkres:osp60]. Let [formula] be the open ball of radius r in [formula] (centered at the origin), and Bn  =  Bn1.

This is essentially Theorem 6 in [\cite=connell:ash63] (for n  ≥  7; refer to the first remark of section 5 of that paper, and [\cite=bing:she63] or [\cite=rushing:te73] for n  ≥  5), by extending h to all of [formula] by the identity outside the ball Bn. The extended homeomorphism of [formula] is clearly stable. The approximating diffeomorphism g in the conclusion of the theorem can be chosen to equal the identity outside Bn1  -  δ, for some δ  >  0 sufficiently small. The only subtlety not stated explicitly there is that g extends to a diffeomorphism of [formula]. But that follows immediately from a careful application of Theorems 5.7 and 6.2 in [\cite=munkres:osp60] as in the proof of Theorem 6 in [\cite=connell:ash63].

More precisely, first choose a suitable triangulation of [formula], and use Connell's Theorem 6 to approximate h by a PL homeomorphism of [formula] with [formula] outside the ball Bn1  -  2δ, for δ  >  0 sufficiently small. Then apply Munkres' Theorem 5.7 with U  =  Bn1  -  δ to get the final approximation by a diffeomorphism with the properties claimed in the statement of the proposition.

The rest of this section is occupied with the reduction of the general case to the open unit ball. In the following, the subscript 0 denotes the subgroup of homeomorphisms homotopic to the identity.

Every [formula] can be approximated uniformly by a diffeomorphism [formula].

We may without loss of generality assume the mass flow (see [\cite=fathi:sgh80] for the definition and a foundational study of this homomorphism) of h vanishes. To see this, recall that the flux homomorphism for volume-preserving diffeomorphisms (the definition and a foundational study can be found in [\cite=banyaga:scd97]) is Poincaré dual to the mass flow homomorphism (on the universal covering spaces), and that the flux homomorphism is surjective. Thus we can find a diffeomorphism [formula], smoothly isotopic to the identity, whose mass flow equals that of h. Clearly the lemma holds for h if and only if it holds for [formula], and the mass flow of the latter vanishes.

Since h is in the kernel of the mass flow homomorphism, it can be fragmented as a finite composition [formula], with each hi contained in the kernel of the mass flow, and supported in a ball Bn(i), [formula], small enough so that Proposition [\ref=pro:local] can be applied to each hi [\cite=fathi:sgh80]. But then h can also be approximated uniformly by a diffeomorphism [formula].

First suppose h is homotopic to a diffeomorphism g. Then [formula] satisfies the hypothesis of Lemma [\ref=lem:id-comp], and the claim follows. Conversely, suppose h can be approximated uniformly by diffeomorphisms. Path components are open by local contractibility [\cite=cernavskii:lcg68], so if g is sufficiently close to h, the two are homotopic through a path of homeomorphisms.

The inclusion Diff [formula] Homeo

Consider the row of maps

[formula]

The first map is the deformation retraction [\cite=banyaga:scd97] of the group of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms given by Moser's isotopy argument [\cite=moser:vem65]. (Thus a necessary and sufficient condition for a diffeomorphism to be isotopic to a volume-preserving diffeomorphism is to preserve orientation.) In particular, r is a homotopy equivalence (with homotopy inverse given by the inclusion map). The remaining maps i are the obvious inclusions. By a result due to Fathi and Y.-M. Visetti [\cite=fathi:sgh80], the last inclusion is a weak homotopy equivalence. Their argument is based on a theorem of S. Eilenberg and R. L. Wilder [\cite=eilenberg:ulc42], which we now recall.

For a subset A of a metric separable space X, and x∈X, we say that A is locally p-connected at x (p-LC at x) if for every ε  =  ε(x)  >  0 there exists a δ  =  δ(x)  >  0 such that every continuous map f:Sp  →  X with image contained in [formula] is nullhomotopic in [formula]. Here Br(x) denotes the ball of radius r centered at x∈X. A is said to be locally p-connected in relation to X (p-LC rel. X) if it is p-LC at every x∈X. Finally, if A is locally p-connected in relation to X for every 0  ≤  p  ≤  k, then we say A is LCk rel. X. For example, if A is locally contractible, it is LCk rel. X for every k. There are obvious notions of uniformly p-LC and uniformly LCk as well.

Let Z be a compact space with dim Z  ≤  k, and suppose A  ⊂  X is LCk rel. X. Then every two maps Z  →  X with image contained in A are homotopic in the closure of A (in X) if and only if they are homotopic in A.

By Theorem [\ref=thm:approximation], the image of [formula] is dense, and moreover, [formula] is locally contractible in the C∞-topology.

Is [formula] LCk for say k  ≤  1 in the compact-open topology?

If the answer is yes, the same argument as in [\cite=fathi:sgh80], p 61, based on the Eilenberg-Wilder theorem, shows the middle inclusion as well is a weak homotopy equivalence.

Which (volume-preserving) homeomorphisms are homotopic to (volume-preserving) diffeomorphisms?

Diffeomorphisms homotopic to the identity

We consider another basic problem in differential topology, namely the following: given a diffeomorphism [formula] homotopic to the identity, i.e. there exists a continuous path in [formula] connecting it to the identity, is φ smoothly isotopic to the identity, i.e. through a smooth path in [formula]?

In [\cite=ruberman:osi98], D. Ruberman gives an example of a diffeomorphism on a 4-manifold which is homotopic to the identity but not smoothly isotopic to the identity, providing a counterexample to the aforementioned question. Like Donaldson's method in the paper [\cite=donaldson:agt83] mentioned in the introduction (giving rise to homeomorphisms that cannot be approximated by diffeomorphisms) Ruberman's method is purely 4-dimensional.

Since the de Rham isomorphism between de Rham and singular cohomology is natural (e.g. [\cite=lee:ism03]), φ acts trivially on de Rham cohomology, and in particular preserves the class of the volume form Ω. By Moser's isotopy method ([\cite=moser:vem65]), φ is smoothly isotopic to a volume-preserving diffeomorphism, so we may without loss of generality assume that φ is volume-preserving. We may further assume that the homotopy to the identity is through volume-preserving homeomorphisms, by the isomorphism induced on homotopy groups by the last map in ([\ref=eqn:row]) in the previous section.

In the situation considered above, does there exist a continuous path to the identity in [formula] with the C0-topology? Can that path be approximated by or homotoped to a smooth path in [formula] with the C∞-topology to give the desired smooth isotopy to the identity? If yes, does this (combined with Ruberman's example) give rise to a volume-preserving homeomorphism on a 4-manifold that cannot be approximated uniformly by diffeomorphisms?

The noncompact and nonorientable cases

In this section we suppose that M is noncompact, and equip all groups of homeomorphisms with the usual direct limit topology. Here the "volume form" Ω is finite on each compact subset and thus induces a Radon measure as on page 85 in [\cite=fathi:sgh80]. If M has nonempty boundary, we again ask that all homeomorphisms are the identity near the boundary. Then Theorem [\ref=thm:approximation] extends to noncompact manifolds. Indeed, suppose that h is homotopic to a diffeomorphism g. As a consequence of the definition of the direct limit topology, there exists a compact set [formula] such that both h and g are compactly supported in K, and homotopic through a homotopy that is compactly supported in K. Then the compact case above applies. To see the necessity of the above condition, note that for ε:M  →  (0,  ∞  ) a continuous function, the uniform ε-ball around h is open in the direct-limit topology. Again by [\cite=cernavskii:lcg68], if g is sufficiently close to h in the direct-limit topology, it is homotopic to h.

Also remark that, by our reduction scheme, the result by Oh or Sikorav on approximability by volume-preserving diffeomorphisms is only needed locally, i.e. in Proposition [\ref=pro:local]. If [formula] near the boundary, their approximation yields volume-preserving diffeomorphisms equal to the identity near the boundary.

Finally we point out that the above generalizes to nonorientable manifolds equipped with a good measure, which is locally given by a volume-density instead of a volume form.
