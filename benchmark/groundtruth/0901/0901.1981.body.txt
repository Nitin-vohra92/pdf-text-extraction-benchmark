2γ-decays of scalar mesons (σ(600), f0(980) and a0(980)) in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model

Introduction

In recent papers [\cite=Bystritskiy:2007wq] [\cite=Volkov:2008ye], the radiative decay φ  →  f0γ and f0(a0)  →  ρ(ω)γ widths within the local Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model [\cite=Volkov:1986zb] [\cite=Volkov:1982zx] [\cite=Ebert:1982pk] [\cite=Volkov:1984kq] [\cite=Ebert:1985kz] [\cite=Ebert:1994mf] [\cite=Volkov:2006vq] [\cite=Vogl:1991qt] [\cite=Klevansky:1992qe] have been calculated. In these works, we took into account not only the quark loop contributions but also the meson loop contributions, moreover, in the decays of the f0(980) meson the kaon loop contribution is the dominant one. It is worth noticing that the situation here is similar to the one that takes place in the case of φ  →  f0γ, f0  →  ργ, f0  →  ωγ decays. Let us note that due to the explicit gauge invariant form of the amplitude the relevant loop integrals do not contain ultraviolet divergences. Thus, the explicit dependence of these amplitudes of the external momenta was obtained [\cite=Ebert:1996pc].

In this paper, we will consider the two-photon decays of the scalar mesons σ(600), f0(980) and a0(980). These decays was considered in a recent paper [\cite=Kalinovsky:2008iz] where a rather rough q2 approximation for quark loop integrals evaluation was used. In our case we consider the full integral corresponding to the quark loop and thus, we can obtain a complete dependence of the amplitude of external momenta.

In the case of the quark loop we consider only a real part of the relevant loop integral. This prescription permits us to take into account the condition of the "naive" quark confinement. Some theoretical arguments supporting this procedure can be found in [\cite=Pervushin:1985yi]. As for the meson loops, both the real and the imaginary parts were taken into account.

The structure of our paper is the following. In Section [\ref=Lagrangian], the NJL quark-meson Lagrangian, corresponding parameters and the coupling constants of our model are defined. In Section [\ref=LoopIntegrals], the methods of quark and meson loop calculation are given.

In Section [\ref=Amplitudes], the contributions of quark and meson loops to the amplitudes and the widths of two-photon decays of the scalar meson are presented.

In Section [\ref=Conclusion], we discuss the results obtaned.

Lagrangian of the NJL model

The Lagrangian of interaction of mesons and quarks within the NJL model has the form [\cite=Volkov:1986zb]:

[formula]

where [formula], and u, d, s are the quark fields, [formula] with mu = md = 263 ~ , ms = 406 ~  - constituent quark mass matrix; [formula] is the quark electric charge matrix, e is the elementary electric charge (e2 / 4π  =  α = 1 / 137), [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] where λi are the well-known Gell-Mann matrices and [formula]. Scalar isoscalar mesons f0, σ are the mixed states

[formula]

with the mixing angle α = 11.3o [\cite=Volkov:1999qb] [\cite=Volkov:1999qn] [\cite=Volkov:2006vq].

The coupling constants from the Lagrangian ([\ref=QuarkMesonLagrangian]) are defined in the following way [\cite=Volkov:1986zb]:

[formula]

where we use the Goldberger-Treiman relation for gπ and gK constants, Fπ = 92.5 ~  and FK  =  1.2 ~ Fπ, and [formula] is the logarithmically divergent integral which has the form:

[formula]

This integral is written in the Euclidean space. The cut-off parameter Λ  =  1.27 ~  is taken from [\cite=Volkov:1986zb] [\cite=Bystritskiy:2007wq].

Quark and meson loop integrals

The amplitudes of the 2γ decay can be expressed in terms of the quark and meson loop integrals.

The quark loop contribution to the amplitude is given by two triangle type Feynman diagrams:

[formula]

Applying the Feynman procedure of joining of the denominators

[formula]

where qx  =  xq2  -  x̄q1, x̄  =  1 - x, we obtain for Tqμν:

[formula]

For meson loops an additional Feynman diagram with two photon-two meson vertex contributes as well. To restore the general gauge invariant form of the amplitude, we can nevertheless consider only two triangle type Feynman diagrams:

[formula]

Extracting the term ~  q1νq2μ and adding the relevant term ~  gμν we obtain:

[formula]

with

[formula]

Standard evaluation of these integrals leads to

[formula]

where zqS  =  4m2q / M2S, zMS  =  4M2 / M2S,

[formula]

We remind that for the quark loop contribution the imaginary part of the function Φ(z) must be omitted, and for the meson loop contribution both the real and possible imaginary parts are relevant.

Similar expressions were obtained in [\cite=Ebert:1996pc], where the imaginary part of the quark loop contribution was taken into account.

Scalar mesons decay amplitudes and widths

The vertices of the quark-meson and quark-photon interactions were given above. The vertices of the meson-meson interaction in the framework of NJL model have the form (for details see [\cite=Volkov:1986zb]):

[formula]

The general structure of the two-photon scalar meson decay amplitudes has the form

[formula]

The expression for the width has the form:

[formula]

The amplitude aa0γγ of a0  →  γγ contains the contribution of u, d quarks and the K-meson intermediate states. The color-charge factor associated with u, d quarks is [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

Taking the K-meson loop contribution we obtain:

[formula]

The corresponding width is

[formula]

In the case of the f0  →  γγ decay we also have the contribution of u, d and s quarks and the K-meson intermediate states. The color-charge factor associated with u, d quarks is [formula] for σu-component of f0 and [formula] for σs-component of f0. Taking the K-meson and the π-meson loop contribution we obtain

[formula]

For the width we have

[formula]

In the case of the σ  →  γγ decay we have

[formula]

The corresponding width is

[formula]

The experimental value of the mass and the width of the σ meson is not well established. We present the width of σ for two other masses: Mσ = 450 ~  and Mσ = 550 ~ . They are

[formula]

The comparison of our results with the experimental data and some other model predictions is given in Table [\ref=TableOfDecays].

Conclusion

The calculations of the radiative decays in the NJL model show an important role of both the quarks and meson loops. Moreover, for the f0 meson decay the kaon loop turns out to provide the dominant contribution. It is worth noticing that the situation here is similar to the one that takes place in the case of φ  →  f0γ [\cite=Bystritskiy:2007wq], f0  →  ρ(ω)γ [\cite=Volkov:2008ye] decays. This fact permits one to understand the success of such models as the model of a kaon molecule [\cite=Weinstein:1990gu] as well as the four-quark model [\cite=Achasov:1987ts] [\cite=Achasov:2008ut] [\cite=Branz:2008ha]. The NJL model used here allows us to take into account both the quark-antiquark state, which manifests itself in the form of quark loops, and the hidden four-quark state, which shows up as meson loops. Let us emphasize that in the framework of the standard NJL model we can describe the 2γ decays without any additional parameters.
