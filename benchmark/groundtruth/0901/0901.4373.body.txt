Invariance of the parametric Oka property

Dedicated to Linda P. Rothschild

The Oka properties

The main result of this paper is that a subelliptic holomorphic submersion π:E  →  B between (reduced, paracompact) complex spaces satisfies the parametric Oka property. Subellipticity means that E admits a finite dominating family of holomorphic fiber-sprays over a neighborhood of any point in B (Def. [\ref=def:SSF]). The conclusion means that for any Stein source space X, any compact Hausdorff space P (the parameter space), and any continuous map f:X  ×  P  →  B which is X-holomorphic (i.e., such that [formula] is holomorphic for every p∈P), a continuous lifting F:X  ×  P  →  E of f (satisfying [formula]) can be homotopically deformed through liftings of f to an X-holomorphic lifting. (See Theorem [\ref=SES:lifting-maps] for a precise statement.)

[formula]

The following result is an easy consequence. Suppose that E and B are complex manifolds and that π:E  →  B is a subelliptic submersion which is also a Serre fibration (such map is called a subelliptic Serre fibration), or is a holomorphic fiber bundle whose fiber satisfies the parametric Oka property. Then the parametric Oka property passes up from the base B to the total space E; it also passes down from E to B if the parameter space P is contractible, or if π is a weak homotopy equivalence (Theorem [\ref=SES:ascend-descend]).

We begin by recalling the relevant notions. Among the most interesting phenomena in complex geometry are, on the one hand, holomorphic rigidity, commonly expressed by Kobayashi-Eisenman hyperbolicity; and, on the other hand, holomorphic flexibility, a term introduced in [\cite=FF:flexibility]. While Kobayashi hyperbolicity of a complex manifold Y implies in particular that there exist no nonconstant holomorphic maps [formula], flexibility of Y means that it admits many nontrivial holomorphic maps X  →  Y from any Stein manifold X; in particular, from any Euclidean space [formula].

The most natural flexibility properties are the Oka properties which originate in the seminal works of Oka [\cite=Oka1] and Grauert [\cite=Grauert2] [\cite=Grauert3]. The essence of the classical Oka-Grauert principle is that a complex Lie group, or a complex homogeneous manifold, Y, enjoys the following:

Basic Oka Property (BOP) of Y: Every continuous map f:X  →  Y from a Stein space X is homotopic to a holomorphic map. If in addition f is holomorphic on (a neighborhood of) a compact O(X)-convex subset K of X, and if f|X' is holomorphic on a closed complex subvariety X' of X, then there is a homotopy ft:X  →  Y (t∈[0,1]) from f0 = f to a holomorphic map f1 such that for every t∈[0,1], ft is holomorphic and uniformly close to f0 on K, and ft|X' = f|X'.

All complex spaces in this paper are assumed to be reduced and paracompact. A map is said to be holomorphic on a compact subset K of a complex space X if it is holomorphic in an open neighborhood of K in X; two such maps are identified if they agree in a (smaller) neighborhood of K; for a family of maps, the neighborhood should be independent of the parameter.

When [formula], BOP combines the Oka-Weil approximation theorem and the Cartan extension theorem. BOP of Y means that, up to a homotopy obstruction, the same approximation-extension result holds for holomorphic maps X  →  Y from any Stein space X to Y.

Denote by C(X,Y) (resp. by O(X,Y)) the space of all continuous (resp. holomorphic) maps X  →  Y, endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on compacts. We have a natural inclusion

[formula]

BOP of Y implies that every connected component of C(X,Y) contains a component of O(X,Y). By [\cite=FF:CAP], BOP also implies the following

One-parametric Oka Property: A path f:[0,1]  →  C(X,Y) such that f(0) and f(1) belong to O(X,Y) can be deformed, with fixed ends at t = 0,1, to a path in O(X,Y). Hence ([\ref=incl]) induces a bijection of the path connected components of the two spaces.

Y enjoys the Weak Parametric Oka Property if for each finite polyhedron P and subpolyhedron P0  ⊂  P, a map f:P  →  C(X,Y) such that f(P0)  ⊂  O(X,Y) can be deformed to a map [formula] by a homotopy that is fixed on P0:

[formula]

This implies that ([\ref=incl]) is a weak homotopy equivalence [\cite=FPrezelj:OP1].

(Parametric Oka Property (POP)) Assume that P is a compact Hausdorff space and that P0 is a closed subset of P. A complex manifold Y enjoys POP for the pair (P,P0) if the following holds. Assume that X is a Stein space, K is a compact O(X)-convex subset of X, X' is a closed complex subvariety of X, and f:X  ×  P  →  Y is a continuous map such that

the map [formula] is holomorphic for every p∈P0, and

fp is holomorphic on [formula] for every p∈P.

Then there is a homotopy ft:X  ×  P  →  Y (t∈[0,1]) such that ft satisfies properties (a) and (b) above for all t∈[0,1], and also

f1p is holomorphic on X for all p∈P,

ft is uniformly close to f on K  ×  P for all t∈[0,1], and

ft = f on [formula] for all t∈[0,1].

The manifold Y satisfies POP if the above holds for each pair P0  ⊂  P of compact Hausdorff spaces. Analogously we define POP for sections of a holomorphic map Z  →  X.

Restricting POP to pairs P0  ⊂  P consisting of finite polyhedra we get Gromov's Ell∞ property [\cite=Gromov:OP]. By Grauert, all complex homogeneous manifolds enjoy POP for finite polyhedral inclusions P0  ⊂  P [\cite=Grauert2] [\cite=Grauert3]. A weaker sufficient condition, called ellipticity (the existence of a dominating spray on Y, Def. [\ref=fiber-spray] below), was found by Gromov [\cite=Gromov:OP]. A presumably even weaker condition, subellipticity (Def. [\ref=def:SS]), was introduced in [\cite=FF:subelliptic].

If Y enjoys BOP or POP, then the corresponding Oka property also holds for sections of any holomorphic fiber bundle Z  →  X with fiber Y over a Stein space X [\cite=FF:Kohn]. See also Sect. [\ref=subelliptic] below and the papers [\cite=FF:surveyOka] [\cite=Larusson1] [\cite=Larusson2] [\cite=Larusson3].

It is important to know which operations preserve Oka properties. The following result was stated in [\cite=FF:CAP] (remarks following Theorem 5.1), and more explicitly in [\cite=FF:EOP]. (See also [\cite=Gromov:OP].)

Assume that E and B are complex manifolds. If π:E  →  B is a subelliptic Serre fibration (Def. [\ref=def:SSF] below), or a holomorphic fiber bundle with POP fiber, then the following hold:

If B enjoys the parametric Oka property ( POP), then so does E.

If E enjoys POP for contractible parameter spaces P (and arbitrary closed subspaces P0 of P), then so does B.

If in addition π:E  →  B is a weak homotopy equivalence then

[formula]

All stated implications hold for a specific pair P0  ⊂  P of parameter spaces.

The proof Theorem [\ref=SES:ascend-descend], proposed in [\cite=FF:EOP], requires the parametric Oka property for sections of certain continuous families of subelliptic submersions. When Finnur Lárusson asked for explanation and at the same time told me of his applications of this result [\cite=Larusson4] (personal communication, December 2008), I decided to write a more complete exposition. We prove Theorem [\ref=SES:ascend-descend] in Sec. [\ref=AD] as a consequence of Theorem [\ref=SES:lifting-maps]. This result should be compared with Lárusson's [\cite=Larusson4] where the map π:E  →  B is assumed to be an intermediate fibration in the model category that he constructed.

Let [formula], where each Yj is a complex manifold and every map πj:Yj  →  Yj - 1 [formula] is a subelliptic Serre fibration, or a holomorphic fiber bundle with POP fiber. Then the following hold:

If one of the manifolds Yj enjoys BOP, or POP with a contractible parameter space, then all of them do.

If in addition every πj is acyclic (a weak homotopy equivalence) and if Y is a Stein manifold, then every manifold Yj in the tower satisfies the implication BOP [formula] POP.

Part (i) is an immediate consequences of Theorem [\ref=SES:ascend-descend]. For (ii), observe that BOP of Yj implies BOP of Y by Theorem [\ref=SES:ascend-descend] (i), applied with P a singleton. Since Y is Stein, BOP implies that Y is elliptic (see Def. [\ref=def:SS] below); for the simple proof see [\cite=FPrezelj:OP3] or [\cite=Gromov:OP]. By Theorem [\ref=SES:OPS] below it follows that Y also enjoys POP. By part (iii) of Theorem [\ref=SES:ascend-descend], POP descends from Y = Ym to every Yj.

A main remaining open problem is whether the implication

[formula]

holds for all complex manifolds. By using results of this paper and of his earlier works, F. Lárusson proved this implication for a large class of manifolds, including all quasi-projective manifolds [\cite=Larusson4]. The main observation is that there exists an affine holomorphic fiber bundle [formula] with fiber [formula] whose total space E is Stein; since the map π is acyclic and the fiber satisfies POP, the implication ([\ref=BOPimpliesPOP]) follows from Corollary [\ref=c1.6] (ii) for any closed complex subvariety [formula] (since the total space E|Y  =  π- 1(Y) is Stein). The same applies to complements of hypersurfaces in such Y; the higher codimension case reduces to the hypersurface case by blowing up.

Subelliptic submersions and Serre fibrations

A holomorphic map h:Z  →  X of complex spaces is a holomorphic submersion if for every point z0∈Z there exist an open neighborhood V  ⊂  Z of z0, an open neighborhood U  ⊂  X of x0 = h(z0), an open set W in a Euclidean space [formula], and a biholomorphic map φ:V  →  U  ×  W such that [formula], where pr1:U  ×  W  →  U is the projection on the first factor.

[formula]

Each fiber Zx = h- 1(x) (x∈X) of a holomorphic submersion is a closed complex submanifold of Z. A simple example is the restriction of a holomorphic fiber bundle projection E  →  X to an open subset Z of E.

We recall from [\cite=Gromov:OP] [\cite=FF:subelliptic] the notion of a holomorphic spray and domination.

Assume that X and Z are complex spaces and h:Z  →  X is a holomorphic submersion. For x∈X let Zx = h- 1(x).

A fiber-spray on Z is a triple (E,π,s) consisting of a holomorphic vector bundle π:E  →  Z together with a holomorphic map s:E  →  Z such that for each z∈Z we have

[formula]

A spray (E,π,s) is dominating at a point z∈Z if its differential

[formula]

at the origin 0z∈Ez  =  π- 1(z) maps the subspace Ez of [formula] surjectively onto the vertical tangent space [formula]. The spray is dominating (on Z) if it is dominating at every point z∈Z.

A family of h-sprays (Ej,πj,sj) [formula] on Z is dominating at the point z∈Z if

[formula]

If this holds for every z∈Z then the family is dominating on Z.

A spray on a complex manifold Y is a fiber-spray associated to the constant map Y  →  point.

The simplest example of a spray on a complex manifold Y is the flow [formula] of a [formula]-complete holomorphic vector field on Y. A composition of finitely many such flows, with independent time variables, is a dominating spray at every point where the given collection of vector fields span the tangent space of Y. Another example of a dominating spray is furnished by the exponential map on a complex Lie group G, translated over G by the group multiplication.

The following notion of an elliptic submersion is due to Gromov [\cite=Gromov:OP]; subelliptic submersions were introduced in [\cite=FF:subelliptic]. For examples see [\cite=FF:subelliptic] [\cite=FF:CAP] [\cite=Gromov:OP].

A holomorphic submersion h:Z  →  X is said to be elliptic (resp.  subelliptic) if each point x0∈X has an open neighborhood U  ⊂  X such that the restricted submersion h:Z|U  →  U admits a dominating fiber-spray (resp. a finite dominating family of fiber-sprays). A complex manifold Y is elliptic (resp. subelliptic) if the trivial submersion Y  →  point is such.

The following notions appear in Theorem [\ref=SES:ascend-descend].

(a) A continuous map π:E  →  B is Serre fibration if it satisfies the homotopy lifting property for polyhedra (see [\cite=Whitehead]).

(b) A holomorphic map π:E  →  B is an elliptic Serre fibration (resp. a subelliptic Serre fibration) if it is a surjective elliptic (resp. subelliptic) submersion and also a Serre fibration.

The following result was proved in [\cite=FF:Kohn] (see Theorems 1.4 and 8.3) by following the scheme proposed in [\cite=FPrezelj:OP3]. Earlier results include Gromov's Main Theorem [\cite=Gromov:OP] (for elliptic submersions onto Stein manifolds, without interpolation), [\cite=FPrezelj:OP3] (for elliptic submersions onto Stein manifolds), [\cite=FF:subelliptic] (for subelliptic submersion), and [\cite=FF:CAP] (for fiber bundles with POP fibers over Stein manifolds).

Let h:Z  →  X be a holomorphic submersion of a complex space Z onto a Stein space X. Assume that X is exhausted by Stein Runge domains [formula] such that every Dj admits a stratification

[formula]

with smooth strata [formula] such that the restriction of Z  →  X to every connected component of each Sk is a subelliptic submersion, or a holomorphic fiber bundle with POP fiber. Then sections X  →  Z satisfy POP.

In previous papers [\cite=FPrezelj:OP1] [\cite=FPrezelj:OP2] [\cite=FPrezelj:OP3] [\cite=FF:subelliptic] [\cite=FF:CAP] [\cite=FF:EOP] POP was only considered for pairs of parameter spaces P0  ⊂  P such that

(*) P is a nonempty compact Hausdorff space, and P0 is a closed subset of P that is a strong deformation neighborhood retract (SDNR) in P.

Here we dispense with the SDNR condition by using the Tietze extension theorem for maps into Hilbert spaces (see the proof of Proposition [\ref=local-ext]).

Theorem [\ref=SES:OPS] also hold when P is a locally compact and countably compact Hausdorff space, and P0 is a closed subspace of P. The proof requires only a minor change of the induction scheme (applying the diagonal process).

On the other hand, all stated results remain valid if we restrict to pairs P0  ⊂  P consisting of finite polyhedra; this suffices for most applications.

Theorem [\ref=SES:OPS] implies the following result concerning holomorphic liftings.

Let π:E  →  B be a holomorphic submersion of a complex space E onto a complex space B. Assume that B admits a stratification [formula] by closed complex subvarieties such that the restriction of π to every connected component of each difference [formula] is a subelliptic submersion, or a holomorphic fiber bundle with POP fiber.

Given a Stein space X and a holomorphic map f:X  →  B, every continuous lifting F:X  →  E of f [formula] is homotopic through liftings of f to a holomorphic lifting.

[formula]

Assume first that X is finite dimensional. Then there is a stratification [formula] by closed complex subvarieties, with smooth differences [formula], such that each connected component S of every Sj is mapped by f to a stratum [formula] for some k = k(j). The pull-back submersion

[formula]

then satisfies the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=SES:OPS] with respect to this stratification of X. Note that liftings X  →  E of f:X  →  B correspond to sections X  →  f*E, and hence the result follows from Theorem [\ref=SES:OPS]. The general case follows by induction over an exhaustion of X by an increasing sequence of relatively compact Stein Runge domains in X.

A fascinating application of Theorem [\ref=Lift] has recently been found by Ivarsson and Kutzschebauch [\cite=Ivarsson-Kutzschebauch] [\cite=Ivarsson-Kutzschebauch2] who solved the following Gromov's Vaserstein problem:

(Ivarsson and Kutzschebauch [\cite=Ivarsson-Kutzschebauch] [\cite=Ivarsson-Kutzschebauch2]) Let X be a finite dimensional reduced Stein space and let [formula] be a null-homotopic holomorphic mapping. Then there exist a natural number N and holomorphic mappings [formula] (thought of as lower resp. upper triangular matrices) such that

[formula]

is a product of upper and lower diagonal unipotent matrices. (For odd N the last matrix has GN(x) in the lower left corner.)

In this application one takes [formula], [formula], and π:E  →  B is the map

[formula]

Every null-homotopic holomorphic map [formula] admits a continuous lifting F:X  →  E for a suitably chosen [formula] (Vaserstein [\cite=Vaser]), and the goal is to deform F to a holomorphic lifting [formula]. This is done inductively by applying Theorem [\ref=Lift] to auxiliary submersions obtained by composing π with certain row projections. Stratified elliptic submersions naturally appear in their proof.

Convex Approximation Property

In this section we recall from [\cite=FF:CAP] a characterization of Oka properties in terms of an Oka-Weil approximation property for entire maps [formula].

Let [formula], [formula], be complex coordinates on [formula]. Given numbers aj,bj > 0 [formula] we set

[formula]

A special convex set in [formula] is a compact convex set of the form

[formula]

where Q is a cube ([\ref=cube]) and φ is a continuous concave function with values in ( - bn,bn). Such (K,Q) is called a special convex pair in [formula].

A complex manifold Y enjoys the Convex Approximation Property (CAP) if every holomorphic map f:K  →  Y on a special convex set [formula] ([\ref=special-convex]) can be approximated, uniformly on K, by holomorphic maps Q  →  Y.

Y enjoys the Parametric Convex Approximation Property (PCAP) if for every special convex pair (K,Q) and for every pair of parameter spaces P0  ⊂  P as in Def. [\ref=POP], a map f:Q  ×  P  →  Y such that [formula] is holomorphic for every p∈P0, and is holomorphic on K for every p∈P, can be approximated uniformly on K  ×  P by maps [formula] such that [formula] is holomorphic on Q for all p∈P, and [formula] for all p∈P0.

The following characterization of the Oka property was found in [\cite=FF:CAP] [\cite=FF:EOP] (for Stein source manifolds), thereby answering a question of Gromov [\cite=Gromov:OP]. For the extension to Stein source spaces see [\cite=FF:Kohn].

For every complex manifold we have

[formula]

The implication [formula] also holds for a specific pair of (compact, Hausdorff) parameter spaces as is seen from the proof in [\cite=FF:CAP]. More precisely, if a complex manifold Y enjoys PCAP for a certain pair P0  ⊂  P, then it also satifies POP for that same pair.

A Parametric Oka Principle for liftings

In this section we prove the main result of this paper, Theorem [\ref=SES:lifting-maps], which generalizes Theorem [\ref=Lift] to families of holomorphic maps. We begin by recalling the relevant terminology from [\cite=FPrezelj:OP3].

Let h:Z  →  X be a holomorphic map of complex spaces, and let P0  ⊂  P be topological spaces.

A P-section of h:Z  →  X is a continuous map f:X  ×  P  →  Z such that [formula] is a section of h for each p∈P. Such f is holomorphic if fp is holomorphic on X for each fixed p∈P. If K is a compact set in X and if X' is a closed complex subvariety of X, then f is holomorphic on [formula] if there is an open set U  ⊂  X containing K such that the restrictions fp|U and fp|X' are holomorphic for every p∈P.

A homotopy of P-sections is a continuous map H:X  ×  P  ×  [0,1]  →  Z such that [formula] is a P-section for each t∈[0,1].

A (P,P0)-section of h is a P-section f:X  ×  P  →  Z such that [formula] is holomorphic on X for each p∈P0. A (P,P0)-section is holomorphic on a subset U  ⊂  X if fp|U is holomorphic for every p∈P.

A P-map X  →  Y to a complex space Y is a map X  ×  P  →  Y. Similarly one defines (P,P0)-maps and their homotopies.

Assume that E and B are complex spaces and π:E  →  B is a subelliptic submersion (Def. [\ref=def:SSF]), or a holomorphic fiber bundle with POP fiber (Def. [\ref=POP]). Let P be a compact Hausdorff space and P0 a closed subspace of P. Given a Stein space X, a compact O(X)-convex subset K of X, a closed complex subvariety X' of X, a holomorphic P-map f:X  ×  P  →  B, and a (P,P0)-map F:X  ×  P  →  E that is a π-lifting of f [formula] and is holomorphic on (a neighborhood of) K and on the subvariety X', there exists a homotopy of liftings Ft:X  ×  P  →  E of f (t∈[0,1]) that is fixed on [formula], that approximates F = F0 uniformly on K  ×  P, and such that F1p is holomorphic on X for all p∈P.

If in addition F is holomorphic in a neighborhood of [formula] then the homotopy Ft can be chosen such that it agrees with F0 to a given finite order along X'.

[formula]

A map π:E  →  B satisfying the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=SES:lifting-maps] is said to enjoy the parametric Oka property (c.f. Lárusson [\cite=Larusson2] [\cite=Larusson3] [\cite=Larusson4]).

The first step is a reduction to the graph case. Set Z = X  ×  E, [formula], and let [formula] denote the map

[formula]

Then [formula] is a subelliptic submersion, resp.  a holomorphic fiber bundle with POP fiber. Let [formula] denote the projection onto the first factor, and let [formula]. To a P-map f:X  ×  P  →  B we associate the P-section [formula] of [formula]. Further, to a lifting F:X  ×  P  →  E of f we associate the P-section [formula] of h:Z  →  X. Then [formula]. This allows us to drop the tilde's on π, f and F and consider from now on the following situation:

Z and [formula] are complex spaces,

[formula] is a subelliptic submersion, or a holomorphic fiber bundle with POP fiber,

[formula] is a holomorphic map onto a Stein space X,

[formula] is a holomorphic P-section of [formula],

F:X  ×  P  →  Z is a holomorphic (P,P0)-section of [formula] such that [formula], and F is holomorphic on [formula].

We need to find a homotopy Ft:X  ×  P  →  Z (t∈[0,1]) consisting of (P,P0)-sections of h:Z  →  X such that [formula] for all t∈[0,1], and

F0 = F,

F1 is a holomorphic P-section, and

for every t∈[0,1], Ft is holomorphic on K, it is unifomly close to F0 on K  ×  P, and it agrees with F0 on [formula].

[formula]

Set [formula] for p∈P. The image fp(X) is a closed Stein subspace of [formula] that is biholomorphic to X (since [formula] is the identity on X).

When P = {p} is a singleton, there is only one section f = fp, and the desired conclusion follows by applying Theorem [\ref=SES:OPS] to the restricted submersion π:Z|f(X)  →  f(X).

In general we consider the family of restricted submersions Z|fp(X)  →  fp(X) (p∈P). The proof of the parametric Oka principle [\cite=FPrezelj:OP2] requires certain modifications that we now explain. It suffices to obtain a homotopy Ft of liftings of f over a relatively compact subset D of X with K  ⊂  D; the proof is then finished by induction over an exhaustion of X. The initial step is provided by the following proposition. (No special assumption is needed on the submersion [formula] for this result.)

(Assumptions as above) Let D be an open relatively compact set in X with K  ⊂  D. There exists a homotopy of liftings of f over D from F = F0|D  ×  P to a lifting F' such that properties (α) and (γ) hold for F', while (β) is replaced by

F'p is holomorphic on D for all p in a neighborhood P'0  ⊂  P of P0.

The existence of such local holomorphic extension F' is used at several subsequent steps. We postpone the proof of the proposition to the end of this section and continue with the proof of Theorem [\ref=SES:lifting-maps]. Replacing F by F' and X by D, we assume from now on that Fp is holomorphic on X for all p∈P'0 (a neighborhood of P0).

Assume for the sake of discussion that X is a Stein manifold, that [formula], and that [formula] is a subelliptic submersion. (The proof in the fiber bundle case is simpler and will be indicated along the way. The case when X has singularities or [formula] uses the induction scheme from [\cite=FF:Kohn], but the details presented here remain unchanged.) It suffices to explain the following:

Main Step: Let K  ⊂  L be compact strongly pseudoconvex domains in X that are O(X)-convex. Assume that F0  =  {F0p}p∈P is a π-lifting of f = {fp}p∈P such that F0p is holomorphic on K for all p∈P, and F0p is holomorphic on X when p∈P'0. Find a homotopy of liftings Ft  =  {Ftp}p∈P (t∈[0,1]) that are holomorphic on K, uniformly close to F0 on K  ×  P, the homotopy is fixed for all p in a neighborhood of P0, and F1p is holomorphic on L for all p∈P.

Granted the Main Step, a solution satisfying the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=SES:lifting-maps] is then obtained by induction over a suitable exhaustion of X.

Proof of Main Step. We cover the compact set [formula] by open sets [formula] such that every restricted submersion π:Z|Uj  →  Uj admits a finite dominating family of π-sprays. In the fiber bundle case we choose the sets Uj such that Z|Uj is isomorphic to the trivial bundle Uj  ×  Y  →  Uj with POP fiber Y.

Choose a Cartan string [formula] in X [\cite=FPrezelj:OP2] such that K = A0 and [formula]. The construction is explained in [\cite=FPrezelj:OP2]: It suffices to choose each of the compact sets Ak to be a small strongly pseudoconvex domain such that [formula] is a Cartan pair for all [formula]. In addition, we choose the sets [formula] small enough such that fp(Aj) is contained in one of the sets Ul for every p∈P and [formula].

We cover P by compact subsets [formula] such that for every [formula] and [formula], there is a neighborhood P'j  ⊂  P of Pj such that the set [formula] is contained in one of the sets Ul.

As in [\cite=FPrezelj:OP2] we denote by K(A) the nerve complex of [formula], i.e., a combinatorial simplicial complex consisting of all multiindices [formula], with [formula], such that

[formula]

Its geometric realization, K(A), is a finite polyhedron in which every multiindex [formula] of length k + 1 determines a closed k-dimensional face |J|  ⊂  K(A), homeomorphic to the standard k-simplex in [formula], and every k-dimensional face of K(A) is of this form. The face |J| is called the body (or carrier) of J, and J is the vertex scheme of |J|. Given I,J∈K(A) we have [formula]. The vertices of K(A) correspond to the individual sets Aj in A, i.e., to singletons (j)∈K(A). (See [\cite=Hurewicz-Wallman] or [\cite=Spanier] for simplicial complexes and polyhedra.)

Given a compact set A in X, we denote by [formula] the space of all sections of h:Z  →  X that are holomorphic over some unspecified open neighborhood A in Z, in the sense of germs at A.

Recall that a holomorphic K(A,Z)-complex [\cite=FPrezelj:OP2] is a continuous family of holomorphic sections

[formula]

satisfying the following compatibility conditions:

[formula]

Note that

F(k) a holomorphic section over (a neighborhood of) Ak,

F(k0,k1) is a homotopy of holomorphic sections over [formula] connecting F(k0) and F(k1),

F(k0,k1,k2) is a triangle of homotopies with vertices F(k0),F(k1),F(k2) and sides F(k0,k1),F(k0,k2),F(k1,k2), etc.

Similarly one defines a continuous K(A,Z)-complex.

A K(A,Z;P)-complex is defined in an obvious way by adding the parameter p∈P. It can be viewed as a K(A,Z)-complex of P-sections of Z  →  X, or as a family of K(A,Z)-complexes depending continuously on the parameter p∈P. Similarly, a K(A,Z;P,P0)-complex is a K(A,Z;P)-complex consisting of holomorphic sections (over the set [formula]) for the parameter values p∈P0. The terminology of Def. [\ref=P-section] naturally applies to complexes of sections.

By choosing the sets [formula] sufficiently small and by shrinking the neighborhood P'0 (furnished by Proposition [\ref=local-ext]) around P0 if necessary we can deform F = F0 to a holomorphic K(A,Z;P,P'0)-complex F* , *  =  {F* ,p}p∈P such that

every section in F* ,p projects by [formula] to the section fp (such F* , * is called a lifting of the holomorphic P-section f = {fp}p∈P),

F(0),p is the restriction to A0 = K of the initial section F0p, and

for p∈P'0, every section in F* ,p is the restriction of F0p to the appropriate subdomain (i.e., the deformation from F0 to F* , * is fixed over P'0).

A completely elementary construction of such initial holomorphic complex F* , * can be found in [\cite=FPrezelj:OP2].

We observe that, although the map [formula] is not necessarily a submersion (since the projection [formula] may have singular fibers), the construction in [\cite=FPrezelj:OP2] still applies since we only work with the fiber component of Fp (over fp) with respect to the submersion [formula]. All lifting problems locally reduce to working with functions.

The rest of the construction amounts to finitely many homotopic modifications of the complex F* , *. At every step we collapse one of the cells in the complex and obtain a family (parametrized by P) of holomorphic sections over the union of the sets that determine the cell. In finitely many steps we obtain a family of constant complexes F1  =  {F1p}p∈P, that is, F1p is a holomorphic section of Z  →  X over L. This procedure is explained in [\cite=FPrezelj:OP2] (see in particular Proposition 5.1.). The additional lifting condition is easily satisfied at every step of the construction. In the end, the homotopy of complexes from F0 to F1 is replaced by a homotopy of constant complexes, i.e., a homotopy of liftings Ft of f that consist of sections over L (see the conclusion of proof of Theorem 1.5 in [\cite=FPrezelj:OP2]).

Let us describe more carefully the main step -- collapsing a segment in a holomorphic complex. (All substeps in collapsing a cell reduce to collapsing a segment, each time with an additional parameter set.)

We have a special pair (A,B) of compact sets contained in L  ⊂  X, called a Cartan pair [\cite=FPrezelj:OP3], with B contained in one of the sets [formula] in our Cartan string A. (Indeed, B is the intersection of some of these sets.) Further, we have an additional compact parameter set [formula] (which appears in the proof) and families of holomorphic sections of h:Z  →  X, a(p,p̃) over A and b(p,p̃) over B, depending continuously on [formula] and projecting by [formula] to the section fp. For p∈P'0 we have a(p,p̃) = b(p,p̃) over [formula]. These two families are connected over [formula] by a homotopy of holomorphic sections bt(p,p̃) (t∈[0,1]) such that

[formula]

hold for each p∈P and t∈[0,1], and the homotopy is fixed for p∈P'0. These two families are joined into a family of holomorphic sections [formula] over [formula], projecting by π to fp. The deformation consists of two substeps:

by applying the Oka-Weil theorem [\cite=FPrezelj:OP1] over the pair [formula] we approximate the family a(p,p̃) sufficiently closely, uniformly on a neighborhood of [formula], by a family [formula] of holomorphic sections over B;

assuming that the approximation in (1) is sufficiently close, we glue the families a(p,p̃) and [formula] into a family of holomorphic sections [formula] over [formula] such that [formula].

For Substep (2) we can use local holomorphic sprays as in [\cite=FF:CAP], or we apply [\cite=FPrezelj:OP1]. The projection condition [formula] is a trivial addition.

Substep (1) is somewhat more problematic as it requires a dominating family of π-sprays on Z|U over an open set [formula] to which the sections bt(p,p̃) project. (In the fiber bundle case we need triviality of the restricted bundle Z|U  →  U and POP of the fiber.) Recall that B is contained in one of the sets Ak, and therefore

[formula]

Since [formula] and Z admits a dominating family of π-sprays over each set Ul, Substep (1) applies separately to each of the m families

[formula]

To conclude the proof of the Main Step we use the stepwise extension method, similar to the one in [\cite=FPrezelj:OP2]. In each step we make the lifting holomorphic for the parameter values in one of the sets Pj, keeping the homotopy fixed over the union of the previous sets.

We begin with P1. The above shows that the Main Step can be accomplished in finitely many applications of Substeps (1) and (2), using the pair of parameter spaces [formula] (instead of P0  ⊂  P). We obtain a homotopy of liftings {Ftp:p∈P'1,t∈[0,1]} of fp such that F1p is holomorphic on L for all p in a neighborhood of P1, and Ftp = F0p for all t∈[0,1] and all p in a relative neighborhood of [formula] in P'1. We extend this homotopy to all values p∈P by replacing Ftp by Ftχ(p)p, where χ:P  →  [0,1] is a continuous function that equals one near P1 and has support contained in P'1. Thus F1p is holomorphic on L for all p in a neighborhood V1 of [formula], and F1p = F0p for all p in a neighborhood of P0.

We now repeat the same procedure with F1 as the 'initial' lifting of f, using the pair of parameter spaces [formula]. We obtain a homotopy of liftings {Ftp}t∈[1,2] of fp for p∈P'2 such that the homotopy is fixed for all p in a neighborhood of [formula] in P'2, and F2p is holomorphic on L for all p in a neighborhood of [formula] in P.

In m steps of this kind we get a homotopy {Ft}t∈[0,m] of liftings of f such that Fmp is holomorphic on L for all p∈P, and the homotopy is fixed in a neighborhood of P0 in P. It remains to rescale the parameter interval

[formula]

.

This concludes the proof in the special case when X is a Stein manifold and [formula]. In the general case we follow the induction scheme in the proof of the parametric Oka principle for stratified fiber bundles with POP fibers in [\cite=FF:Kohn]; Cartan strings are now used inside the smooth strata.

When [formula] is a fiber bundle, we apply the one-step approximation and gluing procedure as in [\cite=FF:CAP], without having to deal with holomorphic complexes. The Oka-Weil approximation theorem in Substep (1) is replaced by POP of the fiber.

We begin by considering the special case when [formula] is a trivial line bundle. We have Fp = (fp,gp) where gp is a holomorphic function on X for p∈P0, and is holomorphic on [formula] for all p∈P. We replace X by a relatively compact subset containing [formula] and consider it as a closed complex subvariety of a Euclidean space [formula]. Choose bounded pseudoconvex domains [formula] in [formula] such that [formula].

By [\cite=FPrezelj:OP3] there exist bounded linear extension operators

[formula]

such that [formula], and likewise for S'. (In [\cite=FPrezelj:OP3] we obtained an extension operator into H∞(Ω), but the Bergman space appeared as an intermediate step. Unlike the Ohsawa-Takegoshi extension theorem [\cite=OhsawaT], this is a soft result depending on the Cartan extension theorem and some functional analysis; the price is shrinking of the domain.) Set

[formula]

Then hp vanishes on X', and hence it belongs to the closed subspace H2X'(Ω) consisting of all functions in H2(Ω) that vanish on [formula]. Since these are Hilbert spaces, the generalized Tietze extension theorem (a special case of Michael's convex selection theorem; see [\cite=Repovs] or [\cite=Dowker] [\cite=Lee]) furnishes a continuous extension of the map P0  →  H2X'(Ω), p  →  hp, to a map [formula]. Set

[formula]

Then

[formula]

This solves the problem, except that Gp should approximate gp uniformly on K. Choose holomorphic functions [formula] on [formula] that generate the ideal sheaf of the subvariety X' at every point in Ω'. A standard application of Cartan's Theorem B shows that in a neighborhood of K we have

[formula]

for some holomorphic functions ξj,p in a neighborhood of K, depending continuously on p∈P and vanishing identically on X for p∈P0. (See e.g. [\cite=FPrezelj:OP2].)

Since the set K is O(X)-convex, and hence polynomially convex in [formula], an extension of the Oka-Weil approximation theorem (using a bounded linear solution operator for the [formula]-equation, given for instance by Hörmander's L2-methods [\cite=Hor] or by integral kernels) furnishes functions [formula], depending continuously on p∈P, such that [formula] approximates ξj,p as close as desired uniformly on K, and it vanishes on [formula] when p∈P0. Setting

[formula]

gives the solution. This proof also applies to vector-valued maps by applying it componentwise.

The general case reduces to the special case by using that for every p0∈P0, the Stein subspace Fp0(X) (resp. fp0(X)) admits an open Stein neighborhood in Z (resp. in [formula]) according to a theorem of Siu [\cite=Dem] [\cite=Siu]. Embedding these neighborhoods in Euclidean spaces and using holomorphic retractions onto fibers of π (see [\cite=FF:Kohn]), the special case furnishes neighborhoods Up0  ⊂  U'p0 of p0 in P and a P-section F':  ×  P  →  Z, homotopic to F through liftings of f, such that

[formula] for all p∈P,

F'p is holomorphic on [formula] when p∈Up0,

F'p = Fp for [formula],

[formula] for all p∈P, and

F' approximates F on K  ×  P.

(The special case is first used for parameter values p in a neighborhood U'p0 of p0; the resulting family of holomorphic maps [formula] is then patched with F by using a cut-off function χ(p) with support in U'p0 that equals one on a neighborhood Up0 of p0, and applying holomorphic retractions onto the fibers of π.) In finitely many steps of this kind we complete the proof.

One might wish to extend Theorem [\ref=SES:lifting-maps] to the case when π:E  →  B is a stratified subelliptic submersion, or a stratified fiber bundle with POP fibers. The problem is that the induced stratifications on the pull-back submersions f*pE  →  X may change discontinuously with respect to the parameter p. Perhaps one could get a positive result by assuming that the stratification of E  →  B is suitably compatible with the variable map fp:X  →  B.

Recall (Def. [\ref=POPmaps]) that a holomorphic map π:E  →  B satisfies POP if the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=SES:lifting-maps] holds. We show that this is a local property.

(Localization principle for POP) A holomorphic submersion π:E  →  B of a complex space E onto a complex space B satisfies POP if and only if every point x∈B admits an open neighborhood Ux  ⊂  B such that the restricted submersion π:E|Ux  →  Ux satisfies POP.

If π:E  →  B satisfies POP then clearly so does its restriction to any open subset U of B.

Conversely, assume that B admits an open covering U  =  {Uα} by open sets such that every restriction E|Uα  →  Uα enjoys POP. When proving POP for π:E  →  B, a typical step amounts to choosing small compact sets [formula] in the source (Stein) space X such that, for a given compact set A0  ⊂  X, [formula] is a Cartan string. We can choose the sets [formula] sufficiently small such that each map fp:X  →  B in the given family sends each Aj into one of the sets Uα∈U.

To the string A we associate a K(A,Z;P,P0)-complex F* , * which is then inductively deformed into a holomorphic P-map [formula] such that [formula]. The main step in the inductive procedure amounts to patching a pair of liftings over a Cartan pair (A',B') in X, where the set B' is contained in one of the sets [formula] in the Cartan string A. This is subdivided into substeps (1) and (2) (see the proof of Theorem [\ref=SES:lifting-maps]). Only the first of these substeps, which requires a Runge-type approximation property, is a nontrivial condition on the submersion E  →  B. It is immediate from the definitions that this approximation property holds if there is an open set U  ⊂  B containing the image fp(B') (for a certain set of parameter values p∈P) such that the restricted submersion E|U  →  U satisfies POP. In our case this is so since we have insured that fp(B')  ⊂  fp(Aj)  ⊂  Uα for some [formula] and Uα∈U.

Ascent and descent of the parametric Oka property

In this section we prove Theorem [\ref=SES:ascend-descend] stated in Sec. [\ref=Sec:Oka].

Proof of (i): Assume that B enjoys POP (which is equivalent to PCAP). Let (K,Q) be a special convex pair in [formula] (Def. [\ref=special]), and let F:Q  ×  P  →  E be a (P,P0)-map that is holomorphic on K (Def. [\ref=P-section]).

Then [formula] is a (P,P0)-map that is holomorphic on K. Since B enjoys POP, there is a holomorphic P-map g:Q  ×  P  →  B that agrees with f on Q  ×  P0 and is uniformly close to f on a neighborhood of K  ×  P in [formula].

If the latter approximation is close enough, there exists a holomorphic P-map G:K  ×  P  →  E such that [formula], G approximates F on K  ×  P, and G = F on K  ×  P0. To find such lifting of g, we consider graphs of these maps (as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=SES:lifting-maps]) and apply a holomorphic retraction onto the fibers of π [\cite=FF:Kohn].

Since G = F on K  ×  P0, we can extend G to [formula] by setting G = F on Q  ×  P0.

Since π:E  →  B is a Serre fibration and K is a strong deformation retract of Q (these sets are convex), G extends to a continuous (P,P0)-map G:Q  ×  P  →  E such that [formula]. The extended map remains holomorphic on K.

By Theorem [\ref=SES:lifting-maps] there is a homotopy of liftings Gt:Q  ×  P  →  E of g (t∈[0,1]) which is fixed on Q  ×  P0 and is holomorphic and uniformly close to G0 = G on K  ×  P. The holomorphic P-map G1:Q  ×  P  →  E then satisfies the condition in Def. [\ref=def:CAP] relative to F. This proves that E enjoys PCAP and hence POP.

Proof of (ii): Assume that E enjoys POP. Let (K,Q) be a special convex pair, and let f:Q  ×  P  →  B be a (P,P0)-map that is holomorphic on K. Assuming that P is contractible, the Serre fibration property of π:E  →  B insures the existence of a continuous P-map F:Q  ×  P  →  E such that [formula]. (The subset P0 of P does not play any role here.) Theorem [\ref=SES:lifting-maps] furnishes a homotopy Ft:Q  ×  P  →  E (t∈[0,1]) such that

F0 = F,

[formula] for each t∈[0,1], and

F1 is a (P,P0)-map that is holomorphic on K.

This is accomplished in two steps: We initially apply Theorem [\ref=SES:lifting-maps] with Q  ×  P0 to obtain a homotopy Ft:Q  ×  P0  →  E (t∈[null]), satisfying properties (a) and (b) above, such that F1 / 2p is holomorphic on Q for all p∈P0. For trivial reasons this homotopy extends continuously to all values p∈P. In the second step we apply Theorem [\ref=SES:lifting-maps] over K  ×  P, with F1 / 2 as the initial lifting of f and keeping the homotopy fixed for p∈P0 (where it is already holomorphic), to get a homotopy Ft (t∈[null]) such that [formula] and F1p is holomorphic on K for all p∈P.

Since E enjoys POP, F1 can be approximated uniformly on K  ×  P by holomorphic P-maps [formula] such that [formula] on Q  ×  P0. Then

[formula]

is a holomorphic P-map that agrees with f on Q  ×  P0 and is close to f on K  ×  P.

This shows that B enjoys PCAP for any contractible (compact, Hausdorff) parameter space P and for any closed subspace P0 of P. Since the implication PCAP[formula]POP in Theorem [\ref=CAP] holds for each specific pair (P0,P) of parameter spaces, we infer that B also enjoys POP for such parameter pairs. This completes the proof of (ii).

Proof of (iii): Contractibility of P was used in the proof of (ii) to lift the map f:Q  ×  P  →  B to a map F:Q  ×  P  →  E. Such a lift exists for every topological space if π:E  →  B is a weak homotopy equivalence. This is because a Serre fibration between smooth manifolds is also a Hurewicz fibration (by Cauty [\cite=Cauty]), and a weak homotopy equivalence between them is a homotopy equivalence by the Whitehead Lemma.
