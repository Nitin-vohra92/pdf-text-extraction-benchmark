Thue's Fundamentaltheorem, II: Some New Irrationality Measures

Introduction

In earlier papers [\cite=Chen1] [\cite=CV] [\cite=LPV] [\cite=TVW], several authors have used Thue's Fundamentaltheorem to completely solve several families of Thue equations and inequalities.

More recently in [\cite=Vout2], we have simplified the statement of Thue's Fundamentaltheorem and investigated the conditions under which it yields effective irrationality measures for algebraic numbers.

In a forthcoming paper, for each positive integer n  ≥  3, we identify families of algebraic numbers of degree n for which Thue's Fundamentaltheorem provides effective irrationality measures that are improvements over Liouville's bound.

The purpose of this paper is to consider other examples. In particular, roots of the polynomial where n  ≥  4 is a positive integer and t is a negative integer (since Fn,t(x) is divisible by x for odd n, we exclude n = 3 as the roots are quadratic in this case).

It turns out that one can find such examples (outside of the above-mentioned families) for many different choices of the γ1 and γ2 in Proposition [\ref=prop:gen-hypg] below. Typically, as here, we find that for fixed γ1 and γ2, there are infinitely many such examples of degree 3 and 4 over [formula] and sometimes some additional ones of higher degree.

We structure this paper as follows. In Section 2, we present our results. Section 3 contains the preliminary results and lemmas that are required to prove our theorems. Sections 4 and 5 contain the proofs of Theorem [\ref=thm:n4gen] and [\ref=thm:n5gen], respectively. In Section 6, we discuss larger values of n, including the case of n = 6 where κ approaches 3 (the Liouville irrationality measure), but from above, so we "just miss" obtaining more new results. Finally, Sections 7-10 contain the proofs of Theorems [\ref=thm:n7t19] through [\ref=thm:n13t7].

Results

Let k = 1 or 3. For a positive integer b  ≥  6, write [formula], where a1 is squarefree. Suppose that [formula] and

[formula]

where 0  <  ε  <  0.5. Let

[formula]

Then

[formula]

for all integers p and q with q  ≠  0, where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Note 1. If ε = o(b- 1 / 3), then this irrationality measure is better than the Liouville bound. In particular, it can be shown that all convergents, a1a22 / b, in the continued-fraction expansion of tan 2(πk / 8) lead to such an improvement.

As in other applications of Thue's Fundamentaltheorem (e.g., [\cite=Chen1] [\cite=CV] [\cite=LPV] [\cite=TVW]), where κ approaches 1 as a parameter like b grows, here as b in the denominator of a continued-fraction convergent grows, κ approaches 1.

Note 2. The condition b  ≥  6 imposes no actual restriction since no b  <  6 allows us to improve on Liouville's theorem.

Let k = 1 or 2. For a positive integer b  ≥  13, write [formula], where a1 is squarefree. Suppose that [formula] and

[formula]

where 0  <  ε  <  0.5. With

[formula]

and

[formula]

put N  =  N1N2.

Then

[formula]

for all integers p and q with q  ≠  0, where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Note 1. Here we require ε = o(b- 2 / 3) to improve on the Liouville irrationality measure. As above, for all convergents, a1a22 / b, in the continued-fraction expansion of tan 2(2πk / 5) lead to such an improvement.

However, unlike Theorem [\ref=thm:n4gen] and other applications of Thue's Fundamentaltheorem, as b, in the denominator of a continued-fraction convergent, grows, κ approaches 5 / 3.

Note 2. The condition b  ≥  13 imposes no actual restriction since no b  <  13 allows us to improve on Liouville's theorem.

Preliminary Results

In this section, we collect the results that are required to prove our theorems above.

Thue's Fundamentaltheorem

We now present our simplified version of Thue's Fundamentaltheorem.

For a positive integer n and non-negative integer r, we put where 2F1 denotes the classical hypergeometric function.

We let Dn,r denote the smallest positive integer such that Dn,rXn,r(x) has rational integer coefficients.

For a positive integer m, we define Nm,n,r to be the greatest common divisor of the numerators of the coefficients of Xn,r(1 - mx).

We will use vp(x) to denote the largest power of a prime p which divides into the rational number x. With this notation, for positive integers m and n, we put and define Cn and Dn are such that holds for all non-negative integers r.

Lastly, following the function name in PARI, we define core(n) to be the unique squarefree divisor, d, of n such that n / d is a perfect square.

Let n, t and x be rational integers with n  ≥  3 and t  ≠  0. Let [formula] be an algebraic integer with [formula] and b  ≠  0, integer and let [formula].

Let γ1 be an algebraic integer in [formula] (not necessarily irrational) with γ2 as its algebraic conjugate.

Write

[formula]

where [formula] and with Z(x) / U(x) = seiφ for s  ≥  0 and -  π  <  φ  ≤  π, then we put (Z(x) / U(x))1 / n = s1 / neiφ / n.

Put

[formula]

where m is the largest positive rational integer such that u1 / (gm) is an algebraic integer and Cn and Dn are as above.

If E  >  1 and either 0  <  Z(x) / U(x)  <  1 or |Z(x) / U(x)| = 1 with Z(x) / U(x)  ≠   - 1, then

[formula]

for all rational integers p and q with q  ≠  0.

Proof. This is Corollary 2 from [\cite=Vout2].

Roots of These Polynomials

We start with the following lemma describing the roots themselves.

Let t be a negative integer.

(i) If n is an odd positive integer, then the roots of Fn,t(x) are [formula] for [formula].

(ii) If n is an even positive integer, then the roots of Fn,t(x) are [formula] for [formula].

Proof. Observe that

[formula]

(i) Letting θ = 2kπ / n, we have

[formula]

Since n is odd, 2 cos (nπ / 2 - 2kπ) = 0 and our result follows.

(ii) Here we let θ = (2k + 1)π / (2n) and we find that

[formula]

Since n is even and 2k + 1 is odd, 2 cos (nπ / 2 - (2k + 1)π / 2) = 0.

The following lemma allows us to identify which root of the polynomial is associated with our choice of x in Proposition [\ref=prop:gen-hypg].

With the above notation, we can write

[formula]

where [formula] is from the principal branch of the n-th root of Z(x) / U(x).

Proof. Substituting the values of the βi's and the γi's, we have

[formula]

the last two identities holding by a half-angle formula and a symmetry about π / 2 respectively.

Since we are taking an n-th root of - 1 in (Z(x) / U(x))1 / n, k will be odd. If n is even, then n - k is odd and A(x) is a root of Fn,t.

If n is also odd, n - k must be even. If [formula], then our result follows. Otherwise, notice that tan ((n - k)π / (2n))  =   tan ((3n - k)π / (2n)) and [formula], completing our proof.

Arithmetic Estimates

(a) For n = 4, we can take Cn = 700,000 and Dn  =   exp (1.6).

(b) For n = 5, we can take Cn = 2.4  ·  106 and Dn  =   exp (1.37).

(c) For n = 7, we can take Cn = 64,000 and Dn  =   exp (1.66).

(d) For n = 13, we can take Cn = 390,000 and Dn  =   exp (2.21).

Proof. This is Lemma 7.4(c) of [\cite=Vout2] applied to these specific values of n.

(a) With N as in Theorem [formula], |g|Nm,4  ≥  2Na21.

(b) With N as in Theorem [formula], |g|Nm,5  ≥  Na2.51.

Proof. (a) We can write

[formula]

so [formula] and [formula].

[formula] g1

From the above expressions for u1 and u2, we see that 2a21|g1.

For determining g3 and m below, we also need to know if additional powers of 2 can divide into g1.

If one of a1a2 and b is even and the other odd, then - u1 / (2a21) = a21a42 - 6a1a22b + b2 is odd. Hence g1 / (2a21) is odd.

If both a1a2 and b are odd, then [formula] and we consider two subcases.

If [formula], then [formula], so [formula] and hence [formula]. Therefore, since 4|(u2 / (2a21)), g1 / (8a21) is an odd integer.

Otherwise, calculating over all possible odd triplets (a1,a2,b) mod 4 with [formula], we find that [formula]. Also [formula], so g1 / (16a21) is an odd integer.

[formula] g2

Since 2a21|g1, we also have

[formula]

As we saw above when considering g1, the gcd on the right-hand side must be 1, so g2 =  - 1.

[formula] g3

Observe that

[formula]

We now use the parity arguments from our consideration of g1.

If one of a1a2 and b is even and the other is odd, then (u1 - u2) / g1 is odd and so g3 = 4.

We now consider the case when both a1a2 and b are odd, and as above break this into two subcases.

If [formula], we saw above that [formula] is odd. But a1a22 - b is even and hence so is [formula]. Therefore [formula] is odd and g3 = 4.

If [formula], then [formula] (as shown above). Also [formula], so here (u1 - u2) / g1 is even. Furthermore, [formula]. Thus g3 = 1.

[formula] g4

Since g2 =  - 1 and g3 = 1 or g3 = 4, core(g2g3) =  - 1 and hence

[formula]

[formula] m

Recall that m is defined to be the largest positive integer such that u1 / (gm) is an algebraic integer. In fact, for determining Nm,4 we are only interested in m being a power of 2.

We have

[formula]

Again, we use the parity arguments from our consideration of g1.

If one of a1a2 and b is even and the other is odd, then a21a42 - 6a1a22b + b2 and g1 / (2a21) are odd and g3 = 4. Hence m = 2.

If both a1a2 and b are odd and [formula], then [formula] and g1 / (8a21) are odd and g3 = 4. Hence m = 2.

If both a1a2 and b are odd and [formula], then [formula] (i.e., if we divide it by 8, then the result is odd). Since g1 / (16a21) is also odd, [formula] is odd as well, so we need only examine [formula], Since g3 = 1 and so m = 1.

Combining these observations, we have shown the following.

If one of a1a2 and b is odd and the other is even, then g1  ≥  2a21, g2 =  - 1. g3 = 4 and m = 2. So |g|Nm,4  ≥  2a21.

If a1a2 and b are both odd with [formula], then g1  ≥  8a21, g2 =  - 1. g3 = 4 and m = 2. So |g|Nm,4  ≥  8a21.

If a1a2 and b are both odd with [formula], then g1  ≥  16a21, g2 =  - 1. g3 = 1 and m = 1. So |g|Nm,4  ≥  16a21.

(b) We can write

[formula]

so [formula] and [formula].

[formula] g1

Now 2a21|g1 and we can write [formula] and u2 / (2a21)  =  5a21a42 - 10a1a22b + b2.

For what follows, we need to know if additional powers of 2 and 5 can divide into g1.

If 5|u1 / (2a21), then 5|a1a2 and if 5|u2 / (2a21), then 5|b. However, we assumed that gcd (a1a22,b) = 1, so this is impossible.

If 2|a1a2, then [formula] so [formula]. Similarly, if 2|b, then [formula]. So g1 / (2a21) is an odd integer.

If both a1a2 and b are odd, then [formula] and we consider two subcases.

If [formula], then [formula], so [formula] and hence [formula]. So u1 / (8a21) is an odd integer. Similarly, u2 / (8a21) is an odd integer. Thus g1 / (8a21) is an odd integer.

If [formula], then we calculate u1 / (2a21) and u2 / (2a21) over all possible odd triplets (a1,a2,b) mod 8 with [formula], we find that [formula]. Hence g1 / (32a21) is an odd integer.

[formula] g2

We also have

[formula]

We will show that g2 =  - a1.

If g2 were larger in absolute value, then any prime divisor, p, of g2 / a1 would have to divide into [formula] and t / a1 = b. So p|b, but it cannot be a divisor of a2 (since gcd (a2,b) = 1. Hence it must divide into a21a42, which is also impossible. So g2 =  - a1.

[formula] g3

For g3, observe that

[formula]

We now use the parity arguments from our consideration of g1.

If a1a2 is even and b is odd, then g1 = 2a21 and so (u1 - u2) / g1 is odd. Hence g3 = 4.

If a1a2 is odd and b is even, then t is even and therefore g3 = 4.

We now consider the case when both a1a2 and b are odd, and as above break this into two subcases.

For [formula], we saw above that u1 / (8a21) and u2 / (8a21) are odd. Therefore [formula] is even. We also have [formula] and so g3 = 2.

If [formula], we saw above that u1 / (32a21) and u2 / (32a21) are odd, so here (u1 - u2) / g1 is even. Furthermore, [formula]. Thus g3 = 1.

We now combine the above observations about g1, g2 and g3 to obtain our values for N2 in Theorem [\ref=thm:n5gen].

If one of a1a2 and b is odd and the other is even, then g1  ≥  2a21, g2 =  - a1 and g3 = 4. So |g|  ≥  a2.51 and we can take N2 = 1.

If a1a2 and b are both odd with [formula], then g1  ≥  8a21, g2 =  - a1 and g3 = 2. So |g|  ≥  a2.51 and we can take [formula].

If a1a2 and b are both odd with [formula], then g1  ≥  32a21, g2 =  - a1 and g3 = 1. So |g|  ≥  32a2.51 and we can take N2  ≥  32.

[formula] g4

We saw above when examining g1 that 5|(u1 / (2a21)) if and only if 5|a1a2. Hence gcd (2,n)n /  gcd (u1 / g1, gcd (2,n)n)) = 5 if [formula] and gcd (2,n)n /  gcd (u1 / g1, gcd (2,n)n)) = 1 otherwise.

Since g2 =  - a1, g3|4 and a1 is square-free, 5|core(g2g3) if and only if 5|a1.

Therefore, g4 = 1.

[formula] m

Recall that m is defined to be the largest positive integer such that u1 / (gm) is an algebraic integer. In fact, for determining Nm,5 we are only interested in m being a power of 5.

We have

[formula]

If 5|a2, then [formula], and as we saw above [formula], so we can take Nm,5 = 55 / 4.

While if 5|a1 and [formula], then [formula] and we can take Nm,5 = 5, by analogous reasoning.

This argument justifies our choice of N1 in Theorem [\ref=thm:n5gen]. Combined with our results above about N2, our lemma follows.

Analytic Estimate

For any real z with - 0.516 < z < 1,

[formula]

Proof. Using Maple, we find that

[formula]

The polynomial on the right-hand side has z = 0, [formula] and z = 3 as its only real roots. This polynomial equals - 7 / 64 at z = 1 and - 7 / 65536 at z =  - 1 / 2. Therefore, it is negative for - 0.516 < z < 3 and the desired lower bound holds in this range.

Similarly,

[formula]

The polynomial on the right-hand side has z = 0 and [formula] as its only real roots. This polynomial equals - 727 / 16384 at z = 1. Therefore, it is negative for z < 3.534 and the desired upper bound holds in this range.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:n4gen]

We apply Proposition [\ref=prop:gen-hypg] with n = 4, t =  - a1b, [formula], [formula], γ1  =  γ2 = 1 and x = a1a2.

Choice of x

We check here that the above value of x gives the algebraic numbers we require.

We have

[formula]

We can write

[formula]

and

[formula]

where - 0.5  <  ε  <  0.5.

So, with b  ≥  6, for k = 1, we have [formula]. Since [formula],

[formula]

Similarly, for k = 3, we have [formula], its imaginary part is negative and so

[formula]

The real part of Z(x) / U(x) can be written as

[formula]

so we will show that this number, and hence Z(x) / U(x) itself, is near 1.

Since tan 4(πk / 8)  -  6 tan 2(πk / 8) + 1 = 0 and [formula], we have

[formula]

So, for k = 1,3 and b  ≥  6,

[formula]

Furthermore, for b  ≥  6,

[formula]

From the above expression for [formula] and these last two inequalities, we find that

[formula]

for b  ≥  6.

Since [formula], | arg ((Z(x) / U(x))1 / 4)| < 0.21. The interval ( - 2.56 + 3π / 4, - 2.2 + 3π / 4) overlaps the interval ( - 0.33,0.33) while the interval ( - 2.62 + π / 4, - 2.18 + π / 4) does not. So from ([\ref=eq:n4-arg1]) and Lemma [\ref=lem:alpha-exp], for k = 1, [formula].

Similarly, considering ([\ref=eq:n4-arg2]), we find that for k = 3, [formula].

Application of Proposition [\ref=prop:gen-hypg]

Since

[formula]

and [formula], it follows that

[formula]

Dividing by 2a21i, the right-hand side becomes

[formula]

We have

[formula]

and

[formula]

where - 0.5  <  ε  <  0.5.

For b  ≥  6 and k = 1 or 3, |ε / (b tan 2(πk / 8))| < 0.49, so the bounds in Lemma [\ref=lem:sqrt-est] apply and we have

[formula]

So, from ([\ref=eq:n4-v21]) and ([\ref=eq:n4-v22LB]),

[formula]

and from ([\ref=eq:n4-v21]) and ([\ref=eq:n4-v22UB]),

[formula]

We also note that

[formula]

Since t < 0 and u1,u2  ≠  0, it follows that u22t - u21 < u22t < 0. Thus [formula]. Furthermore, since [formula],

[formula]

k = 1

For k = 1 and b  ≥  6, [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

and from ([\ref=eq:n4-v2-+]), ([\ref=eq:n4-trig11]) and ([\ref=eq:n4-trig21]), we have

[formula]

We can write this upper bound as

[formula]

If ε  ≤  0, then the expression in ([\ref=eq:n4k1MaxFcn]) is at most [formula].

For 6  ≤  b  ≤  8, ε < 0 and for b = 9, [formula], so for ε > 0, the expression in ([\ref=eq:n4k1MaxFcn]) is at most [formula].

Thus

[formula]

We turn now to the minimum. By ([\ref=eq:n4-v2term-ineq]),

[formula]

From ([\ref=eq:n4-v2++]), ([\ref=eq:n4-trig11]) and ([\ref=eq:n4-trig21]), we have

[formula]

We can write this upper bound as

[formula]

If ε  >  0, then the expression in ([\ref=eq:n4k1MinFcn]) is at most [formula].

As mentioned above, we have ε < 0 for b = 6, 7 and 8. It is negative again for b  ≥  12. Calculating ([\ref=eq:n4k1MinFcn]) directly for b = 6, 7 and 8 and bounding it below by ε >  - 0.5 for b  ≥  12, we find that it is at most

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

and

[formula]

from Lemmas [\ref=lem:denom](a) and [\ref=lem:g-and-n](a).

Finally, we determine an upper bound for c.

We start by bounding the expression below using our definitions,

[formula]

since a1a22 + b = b sec 2(π / 8) + ε < 1.255b for b  ≥  6.

Therefore, since 2.6  ·  106a3 / 21b3 / 2  >  1 and since a1  ≤  a1a22 = b tan 2(π / 8) + ε  <  0.255b for b  ≥  6, we have

[formula]

k = 3

For k = 3 and b  ≥  6, [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

and, from ([\ref=eq:n4-v2++]), ([\ref=eq:n4-trig13]) and ([\ref=eq:n4-trig23]), we have

[formula]

We can write this upper bound as

[formula]

For ε < 0, this expression is at most 93.255b2.

For b = 6, 7 and 8, ε > 0 and we calculate the above expression directly. For b = 9, 10 and 11, ε < 0, so for b  ≥  12, we bound ε from above by 0.5. In this way we find that, for b  ≥  6 and |ε| < 0.5, the expression in ([\ref=eq:n4k3MaxFcn]) is at most 94.54b2 and so

[formula]

We turn now to the minimum. By ([\ref=eq:n4-v2term-ineq]),

[formula]

From ([\ref=eq:n4-v2-+]), ([\ref=eq:n4-trig13]) and ([\ref=eq:n4-trig23]), we have

[formula]

We can write this upper bound as

[formula]

Proceeding as with the maximum, we find that for b  ≥  6 and |ε| < 0.5, this expression is at most 0.3442ε2 and so

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

and

[formula]

from Lemmas [\ref=lem:denom](a) and [\ref=lem:g-and-n](a).

Finally,

[formula]

since a1a22 + b = b sec 2(3π / 8) + ε < 6.912b for b  ≥  6.

Therefore, since 1.444  ·  107(a1b)3 / 2  >  1 and since a1  ≤  a1a22 = b tan 2(3π / 8) + ε  <  5.912b for b  ≥  6, we have

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:n5gen]

We apply Proposition [\ref=prop:gen-hypg] with t =  - a1b, [formula], [formula], γ1  =  γ2 = 1, n = 5 and x = a1a2.

Choice of x

We have

[formula]

We can write

[formula]

and

[formula]

where - 0.5  <  ε  <  0.5.

So, with b  ≥  13, for k = 1, we have [formula]. Since [formula],

[formula]

Similarly, for k = 2, we have [formula], its imaginary part is negative and

[formula]

The real part of Z(x) / U(x) can be written as

[formula]

so we will show that this number, and hence Z(x) / U(x) itself, is near 1.

Since tan 4(2πk / 5)  -  10 tan 2(2πk / 5) + 5 = 0 and [formula], we have

[formula]

So, for k = 1,2 and b  ≥  13,

[formula]

Similarly, again for b  ≥  13,

[formula]

for k = 1 and

[formula]

for k = 2.

Furthermore, for b  ≥  13,

[formula]

for k = 1 and

[formula]

for k = 2.

Combining these last three inequalities, we find that

[formula]

for b  ≥  13.

Since [formula], | arg ((Z(x) / U(x))1 / 5)| < 0.1. Recalling ([\ref=eq:n5-arg1]), [formula] is near (Z(x) / U(x))1 / 5, so by Lemma [\ref=lem:alpha-exp], for k = 1, [formula].

Similarly, considering ([\ref=eq:n5-arg2]), we find that for k = 2, [formula].

Application of Proposition [\ref=prop:gen-hypg]

Notice that

[formula]

so

[formula]

Dividing by [formula], the right-hand side becomes

[formula]

or

[formula]

Notice that [formula] and

[formula]

since t < 0, u2  ≠  0 and hence u22t - u21 < u22t < 0. Thus,

[formula]

We can write a1a22  =  b tan 2(2πk / 5)  +  ε, so

[formula]

and

[formula]

where - 0.5  <  ε  <  0.5.

Therefore,

[formula]

For b  ≥  13, k = 1,2 and |ε| < 0.5, |ε / b /  sec 2(2πk / 5)| < 0.03, so we can apply Lemma [\ref=lem:sqrt-est]. Since we want to use the positive square root, we have

[formula]

So

[formula]

We also note that

[formula]

and

[formula]

k = 1

For k = 1, ([\ref=eq:n5-v21]) can be written as

[formula]

Since |ε| < 1, this quantity, that is 5(a1a22 - b)2 - 4b2, is positive for positive b.

Therefore,

[formula]

And by ([\ref=eq:v2term-ineq]),

[formula]

We have

[formula]

the last equality holding by ([\ref=eq:trig1]) and ([\ref=eq:trig2]).

We can write this upper bound as

[formula]

For b  ≥  13, this is at most 722.9b5 / 2.

Also,

[formula]

the last equality again holding by ([\ref=eq:trig1]) and ([\ref=eq:trig2]).

We can write this upper bound as

[formula]

For b  ≥  13, this is at most 1.076b1 / 2ε2.

Hence

[formula]

and

[formula]

from Lemmas [\ref=lem:denom](b) and [\ref=lem:g-and-n](b).

Finally,

[formula]

since a1a22 + b = b sec 2(2π / 5) + ε < 10.5106b for b  ≥  13.

Therefore, since 7.56  ·  107a3 / 21b3 / 2  >  1 and since a1  ≤  a1a22 = b tan 2(3π / 8) + ε  <  9.5106b for b  ≥  13, we have

[formula]

k = 2

For k = 2, ([\ref=eq:n5-v21]) can be written as

[formula]

Since |ε| < 1, this quantity is negative for b  ≥  13.

For b = 1, we have [formula], so a1a22 = 1 and 5(a1a22 - b)2 - 4b2 =  - 4 is negative.

For b = 2, we have [formula], so we can take a1a22 = 1 yielding 5(a1a22 - b)2 - 4b2 =  - 11 or we can take a1a22 = 2 yielding 5(a1a22 - b)2 - 4b2 =  - 16.

Hence, 5(a1a22 - b)2 - 4b2 is negative for positive b.

Therefore,

And by ([\ref=eq:v2term-ineq]),

Finally,

[formula]

since a1a22 + b = b sec 2(4π / 5) + ε < 1.567b for b  ≥  13.

Therefore, since 1.12  ·  107a3 / 21b3 / 2  >  1 and since a1  ≤  a1a22 = b tan 2(4π / 5) + ε  <  0.5664b for b  ≥  13, we have

Larger n

Before moving on to the proofs of the remaining Theorems, we examine what happens for larger n and why for such n we have only been able to obtain effective irrationality measures that improve on Liouville's for a few algebraic numbers.

Analysis

We can attempt the same analysis for larger values of n.

For n = 6, we "just miss" obtaining a theorem similar to Theorems [\ref=thm:n4gen] and [\ref=thm:n5gen]. For k = 1 (the only k we need consider for n = 6), we obtain the estimates

[formula]

where b, t and ε are as defined in Theorems [\ref=thm:n4gen] and [\ref=thm:n5gen]. As in the proofs of those same theorems, trigonometric identities eliminate the terms of higher order in b in the bound for the minimum.

Since [formula] is a quadratic irrational, ε > c1 / b (1 / (15b), in fact, since its continued-fraction expansion is

Search Details

The algebraic numbers in Theorems [\ref=thm:n7t19]-[\ref=thm:n13t7] were found by a computer search. We describe here how that search was carried out as well as the extent of the search.

The main idea behind the search is that 1 - Z(x) / U(x) must be small in order for us to be able to apply the hypergeometric method to good effect. The condition 1 - Z(x) / U(x) is the same as saying that U(x) - Z(x) = Fn,t(x) is small. That is, we choose x near a root of Fn,t.

So for each 7  ≤  n  ≤  50, our search was structured as follows.

(i) for each positive square-free integer t  ≤  1000, and each integer x from [formula] to [formula], apply Proposition [\ref=prop:gen-hypg] to find values of κ  <  φ(n) - 1.

For larger values of t, we observe that since x is close to [formula] (for θ as in Lemma [\ref=lem:root-exp1]), x2 / t must be close to tan 2(θ). As discussed in the previous subsection, for larger n we need the "best" approximations; and these come from the continued-fraction expansion of tan 2(θ). If p / q is a convergent in the continued-fraction expansion of tan 2(θ) and we write p = p1  ·  p22 where p1 is a square-free integer, then we can put x = p1  ·  p2 and t = p1  ·  q.

(ii) apply Proposition [\ref=prop:gen-hypg] to the values of t and x obtained from the first 20 convergents in the continued-fraction expansion of the appropriate tan 2(θ)'s.

The algebraic numbers in Theorems [\ref=thm:n7t19]-[\ref=thm:n13t7] were found from step (i). No further examples were found in this way although there were some "near misses". Particularly striking is the example, t = 4992086833624447048438244097954 and x = 2801720872705678, for which the hypergeometric method yields

[formula]

for q  ≠  0. So the exponent is a mere [formula] too large.

This example also shows that it is possible, although we believe it to be unlikely, that there may be other larger examples that we have missed.

Because of the size of the numbers involved, the above calculations were performed using PARI (version 2.3.3).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:n7t19]

We first determine the quantities defined in the Proposition [\ref=prop:gen-hypg].

Put n = 7, t =  - 19, [formula], [formula] and γ1  =  γ2 = 1.

From Lemma [\ref=lem:root-exp1], we know that the roots of the associated polynomial, F(x), are of the form [formula] for [formula].

Choice of x

Next we have to find a value for x so that This will give us a sequence of particularly good rational approximations to [formula]. We show that x = 19 is such a value.

We have

[formula]

Recall that we are using the principal branch when taking the 7-th root here, so

So we can apply Lemma [\ref=lem:alpha-exp] with n = 7 and k = 1. In this case, 3n - k = 20 and we have [formula] as required.

Application of Proposition [\ref=prop:gen-hypg]

We saw above that we can write

[formula]

so u1  =  27  ·  194 and u2  =    -  27  ·  193  ·  559.

Now

[formula]

Since [formula] and [formula], we have g3 = 1. Lastly,

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Since

[formula]

so m = 1 and N1,7 = 1.

Notice that

So

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

and

[formula]

from Lemma [\ref=lem:denom](c).

Finally,

[formula]

where

[formula]

so we can let c = 9.5  ·  1041.

We find that for all integers p and q with q  ≠  0.

Improved Constant

The constant c above is rather large. At the expense of a slightly larger κ, we can significantly reduce the size of c as in the proof of Corollary 2.2 of [\cite=Vout1].

We used Maple 8 to calculate the first 14,000 partial fractions in the continued-fraction expansion of [formula]. This calculation took 2950 seconds on a PC with an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU running at 2.00 GHz. The denominator of the 13,700-th convergent is greater than 106990 and it is easy to verify that for all q whose absolute value is larger than that.

Thus, it only remains to check that the desired inequality is satisfied for all q whose absolute value is at most the denominator of the 13,700-th convergent.

Rather than checking the convergents directly, we can use the theory of continued-fractions: where ai + 1 is the i + 1-st partial fraction in the continued-fraction expansion of α while pi / qi is the i-th convergent.

The largest partial fraction found for [formula] was a1311 = 21,976. Therefore, the corollary holds for |q|  >  18.6  >  (0.09  ·  (21976 + 2))(1 / 2.6). Now a direct check among the smaller convergents completes the proof of our result.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:n7t39]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:n7t39] is essentially the same as the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:n7t19]. So we will follow the same steps, but not include quite so many of the details here.

We put n = 7, t =  - 39, [formula], [formula] and γ1  =  γ2 = 1 in Proposition [\ref=prop:gen-hypg].

From Lemma [\ref=lem:root-exp1], we know that the roots of the associated polynomial, F(x), are of the form [formula] for [formula].

We find that for all integers p and q with q  ≠  0.

Improved Constant

Again, we perform some continued-fractions calculations to reduce the size of the constant c above.

We used Maple 8 to calculate the first 6,000 partial fractions in the continued-fraction expansion of [formula]. This calculation took 295 seconds on a PC with an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU running at 2.00 GHz. The denominator of the 5,100-th convergent is greater than 102660 and for all q whose absolute value is larger than that.

As before, for [formula], we check

The largest partial fraction found for [formula] was a4021 = 14,265. Therefore, the corollary holds for |q|  >  37.9  >  (0.007  ·  (14265 + 2))(1 / 1.28). Now a direct check among the smaller convergents completes the proof of our result.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:n7t77]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:n7t77] is again the same as the previous ones.

We put n = 7, t =  - 77, [formula], [formula] and γ1  =  γ2 = 1 in Proposition [\ref=prop:gen-hypg].

From Lemma [\ref=lem:root-exp1], we know that the roots of the associated polynomial, F(x), are of the form [formula] for [formula].

We find that for all integers p and q with q  ≠  0.

Improved Constant

Again, we perform some continued-fractions calculations to reduce the size of the constant c above.

We used Maple 8 to calculate the first 8000 partial fractions in the continued-fraction expansion of [formula]. This calculation took 665 seconds on a PC with an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU running at 2.00 GHz. The denominator of the 7700-th convergent is greater than 103970 and for all q whose absolute value is larger than that.

As before, for [formula], we check

The largest partial fraction found for [formula] was a7695 = 9039. Therefore, the corollary holds for |q|  >  9.2  >  (0.003  ·  (9039 + 2))(1 / 1.49). Now a direct check among the smaller convergents completes the proof of our result.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:n13t7]

We put n = 13, t =  - 7, [formula], [formula] and γ1  =  γ2 = 1 in Proposition [\ref=prop:gen-hypg].
