Fano Varieties with Large Degree Endomorphisms

We work over the complex number field [formula]. An endomorphism of a projective variety X is a morphism f:X  →  X. If f is surjective, then it is automatically finite.

Examples of projective varieties with an endomorphism of degree > 1 are [formula] and abelian varieties. In fact, these are essentially all known smooth examples. When X has non-negative Kodaira dimension, this is discussed in [\cite=nz07]. It is also conjectured that if X is a smooth Fano variety of Picard number 1 that admits a degree > 1 endomorphism, then [formula] [\cite=am97]. This is confirmed in some cases, including when the dimension is less or equal to 3 [\cite=arv99], when X is a quasi-homogeneous [\cite=hn08], when X is a large degree hypersurface of a prime Fano manifold of Picard number 1 [\cite=ch08], or when X contains a smooth conic [\cite=hm03]. [\cite=zh08] considered Fano varieties with Picard number 1 and, with terminal singularities that have an endomorphism of degree > 1. He conjectured that they are necessarily rational. Our aim in this note is to point out that this is not quite true and suggest a slight modification that is consistent with these examples.

Any subgroup G  ⊂  Sn + 1 acts on [formula] where Sn + 1 acts by permuting the coordinates. The endomorphism φd of raising each coordinate to its d-th power commutes with this action, so it descends to a degree dn endomorphism of [formula].

According to the philosophy of [\cite=kl07], [formula] should have terminal singularities for almost all G. The precise conditions are checked in Lemma [\ref=terminal]. Some examples where [formula] is not rational are given by [\cite=sa85]. In his examples, G is a nonabelian group of order p9 for some prime p and G  ⊂  S|G| + 1 fixes the last coordinate and acts by the left G-action on itself on the first |G| coordinates.

1. These examples suggest the possibility that if a Fano variety X of Picard number 1 has terminal singularities and admits a degree > 1 endomorphism then X is a quotient of [formula].

2. It seems likely that if G is large enough, then the φd are the only endomorphisms of [formula] that commute with the G-action. Thus we may get examples of Fano varieties which have very few endomorphisms of degree > 1.

Let G  ⊂  Sn be a subgroup with the induced action on [formula] by permuting the coordinates. Assume that none of the elements of G is conjuagte (in Sn) to one of the premutations (12),(123) or (12)(34). Then [formula] has terminal singularities.

Let the order of g be m. Assume that the action of g∈G on the set {1,2,...,n} gives cycles of length n1,n2,...,nk with [formula]. So ni|m and we write m = nimi. After a linear transformation of the coordinates, g acts by

[formula]

where ξ is a primitive m-th root of unity.

Now we compute the age of g at a fixed point x of g. (See [\cite=ir96], [\cite=re02] for the definition and for the Reid-Tai criterion.) If a fixed point is on the chart tp  ≠  0, then, for each 1  ≤  j  ≤  k, the contribution of the cycle of length nj to the age is the sum of all numbers c / m where 0  ≤  c < m and c can be written as c = kmj - p for some [formula]. This sum is bigger or equal to

[formula]

Therefore, [formula] is always larger than 1 if g is not any one of the cases listed above. The Reid-Tai criterion implies that [formula] has terminal singularities.
