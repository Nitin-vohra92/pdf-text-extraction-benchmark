Solvability of Generalized Monomial Groups

Introduction

Let G be a finite group. Then a character χ of G is called monomial if χ  =  φG for a linear character of some subgroup U  ≤  G. If all irreducible characters of G are monomial, G is called monomial. A classical theorem by Taketa (see for example [\cite=Is], Cor. (5.13)) states that monomial groups are solvable. There are several generalizations of Taketa's result, e.g. the statement that if all the inducing subgroups U have the property that the composition factors of U / ker(φ) are in a given set of simple groups, then also the composition factors of G lie in this set. In particular, Taketa's argument can easily be generalized to the case that U / ker(φ) is always solvable. In this paper, we will consider a different generalization, namely the case that only some multiple of the character χ is "solvably induced":   By definition, monomial groups are a special case of QSI groups, because there we always have k = 1 and φ linear, i.e. U / ker(φ) abelian. It is trivial that even all solvable groups are QSI (simply set U: = G, φ: = χ and k: = 1). This paper aims at proving the converse of that statement, i.e.:   The phenomenon of "quasi-induced" characters in the sense of definition [\ref=qsi] arises in a natural way in the study of Artin L-functions: Let F|K be a Galois extension of number fields with group G, and χ∈Char(G) a character. Then one can define a certain number-theoretic function L(s,χ,F|K), called an Artin L-function, (where [formula], Re(s)  >  1). Artin L-functions are a generalization of Dirichlet L-functions, and as with the latter, the question arises if they can be continued homomorphically to [formula]. Artin's conjecture states that this is true for all finite groups G and all χ∈Char(G) with (χ,1)  =  0. (If χ  =  1, then the Artin L-function is just the zeta function of K, and therefore meromorphic with a simple pole at s = 1.) From the functional equation of Artin L-functions it follows that [formula], so it suffices to prove Artin's conjecture for all 1  ≠  χ∈Irr(G). Still the conjecture is only known to be true for certain special cases, e.g. for 1  ≠  χ linear. It is also known that for a subgroup U  ≤  G and a character φ∈Char(U) there is a relation between the L-functions of φ and of φG, namely

[formula]

where FU is the fixed field of U. Brauer proved that for the general case there is at least a meromorphic continuation on [formula]. The proof is based mainly on Brauer's induction theorem:

Let 1  ≠  χ∈Irr(G), then [formula], where the φi are linear characters of subgroups Ui of G, and [formula]. But it is well-known that

[formula]

and by the above properties each factor of this product is obviously meromorphic.

These first results can be used to prove the following

Let F|K be a Galois extension of number fields with group G, and χ∈Char(G) a quasi-monomial character, i.e. k  ·  χ  =  φG for some U  ≤  G, φ∈Irr(U) linear, and [formula]. If (χ,1)  =  0, then L(s,χ,F|K) has a holomorphic continuation on [formula].

Obviously φ  ≠  1. Therefore L(s,χ,F|K)k  =  L(s,k  ·  χ,F|K)  =  L(s,φG,F|K)  =  L(s,φ,F|FU) has a holomorphic continuation on [formula], and together with Brauer's result mentioned above the same follows for L(s,χ,F|K).

This argument obviously works whenever Artin's conjecture is known to be true for L(s,φ,F|FU). For example, Langlands and Tunnell ([\cite=La], [\cite=Tu]) proved the conjecture for characters φ degree 2, with U / ker(φ) solvable. In this case U / ker(φ) is a cyclic central extension of a finite solvable subgroup of [formula], and it is well-known that these finite subgroups are either cyclic, dihedral or isomorphic to A4 or S4.   The result of theorem [\ref=Hauptsatz] can therefore be interpreted in the following way: Even if Artin's conjecture were known to be true for all solvable groups, the methods shown above will not enable one to prove the conjecture for a single non-solvable group.

Reduction to finite simple groups

As the proof of Taketa's theorem essentially uses the fact that k = 1 always holds, a proof of theorem [\ref=Hauptsatz] requires different ideas. In this chapter we will reduce the general problem outlined in section 1 to the investigation of finite simple groups. After this we can attack the problem case by case, thanks to the classification of finite simple groups. First, a simple observation:

If G is QSI, and [formula], then also G / N is QSI.

Every irreducible character [formula] of G / N yields an irreducible character χ of G, with [formula]. Now χ is QSI from U  ≤  G, i.e. k  ·  χ  =  φG for some φ∈Irr(U). Thus [formula], i.e. [formula], and φ corresponds to a character ∈Irr(U / N). But

[formula]

[formula]

and therefore [formula] is QSI.

Let G be a minimal counterexample to the assertion of Theorem [\ref=Hauptsatz]. Then [formula], where N  =  Sm, and S is a non-abelian simple group.

Let G be such a minimal counterexample, i.e. G is finite, nonsolvable, but QSI. Let N be a minimal normal subgroup of G. Then N  =  Sm for some finite simple group S. By the minimality of G, G / N must be solvable (as G / N is also QSI). Therefore N is nonsolvable, which means that S is non-abelian. If there existed another minimal normal subgroup N̂, then [formula], so [formula], contrary to the solvability of G / N. So N must be the unique minimal normal subgroup of G. As [formula], we have either CG(N)  =  1 or CG(N)  ≥  N. The latter is obviously impossible. So G  =  NG(N) / CG(N)  ≤  Aut(N).

In the following, we will look at such possible minimal counterexamples G. Note that if N  =  Sm with a non-abelian finite simple group S, then Aut(N) is a semidirect product: [formula]. With the following simple argument, which basically uses a special case of Mackey's decomposition formula, we can derive from the QSI-property of G at least the QSI-property of certain characters of a normal subgroup N of G:

Let [formula], and χ∈Irr(N) be a G-invariant character (e.g. a character which is uniquely determined by its degree), such that there exists a QSI character ρ∈Irr(G) with (ρ|N,χ)  ≠  0. Then χ is QSI, too.

Let ρ∈Irr(G) with (ρ|N,χ)  ≠  0, then by Clifford's theorem ρ|N  =  k  ·  χ for some [formula]. Let U  ≤  G and φ∈Irr(U) such that ρ is QSI from U and φ, so (φGU)|N  =  k  ·  m  ·  χ, for some [formula]. But that means for x∈N and g1,...gn representatives of cosets of N:

[formula]

and as the sum is a multiple of χ, the same must hold for any of its components, e.g. [formula] is a multiple of χ. But that means that χ is QSI from [formula].

In our situation, with Sm  ≤  G  ≤  Aut(S)m:Sym(m), we can argue in two steps: Firstly if χ is an Aut(S)-invariant irreducible character of S, then χm is G-invariant in N  =  Sm. So if G is QSI, then so is the character χm, and therefore also χ. So now all we need to do is to find for each non-abelian simple group S an Aut(S)-invariant irreducible character that cannot be QSI. In order to prove that a subgroup U, as required, does not exist, we need one more simple observation:

Let χ∈Irr(G) be QSI from U and φ; then:

U intersects every class on which χ takes a non-zero value. More precisely, the fraction of the class of g∈G which is contained in U must be at least [formula].

If U is non-abelian simple, then χ  =  1G.

1) is clear by the definition of an induced character. 2) If U is non-abelian simple, then φ  =  1U, hence 1G is a component of φG, and so χ  =  1G (and more precisely U = G).

Proof for the case An

Let S  =  An, n  ≥  5, n  ≠  6. Sm  ≤  G  ≤  Aut(Sm). Then G is not QSI.

Assume that G is QSI. To obtain a contradiction we only need to find an Aut(S)-invariant irreducible character of S which is not QSI. As we have excluded the case n = 6 (we will treat [formula] later as a group of Lie type), it always holds that Aut(S) = Sn, and therefore the character χn: = πn - 1 of degree n - 1, with πn the permutation character of the natural action, is Aut(S)-invariant. For the case n = 5, it's easy to see that a subgroup with the required properties does not exist (e.g. we would need elements of both orders 5 and 3). In all other cases the 2-point stabilizer An - 2 is still doubly transitive. Now assume the character χn∈Irr(An) were QSI, i.e. k  ·  χn  =  φAn for some φ∈Irr(U), U  <  An, and U / ker(φ) solvable. But (χn)|An - 2  =  χn - 2  +  2  ·  1An - 2, and so by Mackey's formula

[formula]

where the t are representatives of double cosets of An - 2 and U. Therefore also [formula], with [formula], and by replacing U with some Ut we can assume w.l.o.g that k2  >  k1, i.e. this character sum takes only positive values. But that means that the inducing subgroup [formula] has to intersect all conjugacy classes of An - 2, which is only possible for U  ≥  An - 2. We already know that U cannot be non-abelian simple, therefore [formula]. But this is impossible too, e.g. the conjugacy classes of (1...n) or (1...n - 3)(n - 2,n - 1,n) (depending on which of those permutations is even) would have to intersect U.

Proof for the sporadic cases

In all cases the following procedure already succeeds: Find an Aut(S)-invariant irreducible character χ  ≠  1 with non-zero values on elements of certain orders. If possible these element orders are chosen so that there is no maximal subgroup of S with order divisible by all of them, which already contradicts QSI-property. If maximal subgroups with the required order exist but are always non-abelian simple we can descend further and hope to get a contradiction in the next step. The character degrees, element orders, and, if they exist, the maximal subgroups M containing elements of all these orders, are given in table [\ref=T1]. In each case the characters, and if possible the maximal overgroups of the chosen elements, were taken from [\cite=ATLAS] and checked with the computer programs GAP and/or MAGMA. In addition, in several cases (but not in all, as our choice of elements shows), table 4 from [\cite=GK] was used to obtain the maximal subgroups containing one of the specified elements. Often those subgroups are normalizers or other small subgroups, so that the number of conjugacy classes not contained there is so large that the second class can almost be chosen arbitrarily. Note also that we include the Tits group Ti: = 2F4(2)' here, and not in the Lie type section, as Ti has no unique (Steinberg) character of degree |Ti|2 (and, strictly speaking, is not a Lie type group).

Proof for the classical groups

In this section let S  =  S(n,pr) be a non-abelian simple classical group over a field of characteristic p. For these groups, and more generally for all simple groups of Lie type, there is a unique irreducible character, called the Steinberg character St, of degree |S|p, where the latter is the highest power of p dividing |S|. Moreover, St(g)  ≠  0 whenever g is a p'-element . We will prove that (with few exceptions) St cannot be QSI by looking at the maximal overgroups of certain p'-elements, and concluding that elements of some other order coprime to p cannot be contained there. To this aim, recall the following results about some special elements of finite classical groups:

In GLn(q) there exists a cyclic subgroup T of order qn - 1 acting transitively on the non-zero vectors of V - and in particular irreducibly on [formula] . Every irreducible cyclic subgroup of GLn(q) is contained in such a group T. T is called a Singer cycle. In general, if G  ≤  GLn(q) is a classical group over V, and [formula] acts irrreducibly on V, then [formula] is called a Singer cycle of G. Singer cycles exist in SLn(q) (and have order [formula]), Sp2n(q) (order qn + 1), O-2n(q) (order qn + 1) and for n odd also in GUn(q) (order qn + 1 as well).In contrast, the groups GUn(q) for n even, O+2n(q) and O2n + 1(q) do not contain Singer cycles.

Moreover the following well-known result (see [\cite=Z1]) will be of vital importance for our subsequent considerations:

As an immediate consequence we get

Let [formula], both ≥  2, and pn a primitive prime divisor of dn - 1. Then [formula]. If at the same time pn divides dm - 1, then:  n|m.

The first part follows from the fact that d obviously has multiplicative order n modulo pn, and thus φ(pn)  =  pn - 1 is divisible by n. With dn - 1 and dm - 1, pn also divides dm - n - 1. By induction, this yields the second part of the assertion.

Note that an element of GLn(q) with order divisible by a primitive prime divisor of qn - 1 is necessarily irreducible (by Maschke's theorem). Now let S be a finite simple classical group, and Ŝ the natural pre-image of S in GL(V), i.e. Ŝ  =  SL(V), Sp(V), SU(V) or Ω( +  /  - )(V) respectively. Furthermore let x̂ be an element of a maximal torus T̂ of Ŝ, as given in table [\ref=T3]. Note that S  =  Ssc / Z(Ssc), where Ssc is the simply-connected version of the respective group of Lie type. The orders of all maximal tori of Ssc are well-known, see e.g. Carter([\cite=Ca2], Propositions 7-10). For our specific selection cf. [\cite=MSW], table 1.1. In the cases PSLn(q), PSUn(q) with n odd, PSp2n(q) and PΩ-2n(q), x̂ is a Singer element of Ŝ. In the remaining cases we use Singer elements of certain subgroups. For the case S  =  PSUn(q) we make use of the embedding [formula]. For S  =  PΩ2n + 1(q), or PΩ+2n + 2(q) respectively, we choose a Singer element of Ω-2n(q), using for this purpose the embeddings [formula], and for q odd: [formula]. We now consider the maximal overgroups of the elements x. According to Aschbacher's classification ([\cite=As1]), a maximal subgroup of a simple classical group belongs either to one of eight classes C1, ..., C8 (whose representatives can in each case be viewed as stabilizers of certain structures), or to a set S of exceptional cases. The respective maximal overgroups of x are given in [\cite=MSW], Theorem 1.1 (and partly in [\cite=Be1]). In groups with Singer elements those are mostly subgroups of Aschbacher class C3 ("field extension type"), in the other groups mainly subgroups of class C1 (reducible subgroups). The following theorem summarizes the results of [\cite=Be1] (for PSLn(q)) and [\cite=MSW], Theorem 1.1 (for the remaining classical groups): Now it is relatively easy to prove that the Steinberg character of a non-abelian simple group of Lie type cannot be QSI (with a small number of exceptions). First we consider the exceptional cases:

S  =  PSLn(q), with [formula] [formula] has already been treated. In [formula], as the Steinberg character takes non-zero values on all elements of order prime to 3, we need a subgroup with order divisible by 20. But that only leaves A5, which is non-abelian simple. In PSL3(4) there are no subgroups containing elements of orders 3,5 and 7 simultaneously. Finally, [formula] has two Steinberg characters. However, both are monomial, so here for once we have to deviate with our choice for χ. There is a unique character of degree 6, with non-zero values on elements of order 2 and 7, and a maximal subgroup with order divisible by 14 does not exist.

In S  =  PSU4(2), no proper subgroup contains elements of orders 9 and 5 simultaneously.

S  =  PSU3(3),M  =  PSL2(7). Then M is non-abelian simple, so we have to look only at proper subgroups, none of which contain both the divisors 2 and 7. S  =  PSU3(5),M  =  A7. Here S contains elements of order 8, A7 obviously does not. S  =  PSU5(2),M  =  PSL2(11). Once again we need to descend further, and no proper subgroup of PSL2(11) contains the divisors 3, 5 and 11 simultaneously. S  =  PSU4(3), [formula]: In both cases elements of order 8 are missing. S  =  PSU6(2), M  =  M22: Elements of order 15 are not contained. S  =  PΩ7(3), M  =  S9: |S| is divisible by 13. S  =  PSp8(2), M  =  PSL2(17): Here, the prime divisors 5 and 7 of |S| are missing in |M|. S  =  PSp4(3), M  =  24.A5: Note that [formula] . S  =  PΩ+8(2), M  =  A9: No proper subgroup of A9 contains elements of orders 7 and 9 simultaneously.

S  =  PΩ+8(q), and either [formula] with q odd, or [formula] with q even: This is a special case only with regard to Aschbacher classification, but not for our purposes, as we only need order arguments. Hence these cases can be treated like the standard ones, which we will consider from now on.

It often suffices to use order arguments in the following way: many of the maximal overgroups M of x lose primitive prime divisors of qd - 1 for some [formula], so they are not in question for inducing the Steinberg character. In the few cases where the respective primitive prime divisor does not exist, the structure of M may show that certain elements cannot be contained. A similar argumentation is already contained in [\cite=MSW], pp. 110 ff. Additionally we can use another remark about the Steinberg character St of a Lie type group:

Let S  =  S(n,pr) be a simple group of Lie type with defining characteristic p, and assume that its Steinberg character St is QSI from U and φ. Then [formula].

|S|p  =  St(1) |   ·  φ(1) | , and the assertion follows.

This will enable us to reduce certain cases to previous ones: E.g., if a maximal overgroup of x has a (non-abelian simple) Lie-type socle over the same characteristic as the group S, with conjugates of x contained only in the socle, then we can descend to extensions of maximal subgroups of this socle.

S  =  PSLn(q), and |M| divides |GLn / r(qr).r|. Here we lose a primitive prime divisor of qn - 1 - 1, unless n  ≤  3, (n,q)  =  (7,2), or the case that r  =  n is this prime divisor. In the last case (with n > 3) we certainly lose a primitive prime divisor of qn - 2  -  1, and PSL7(2) can be checked directly. If n = 3, |M| divides 3(q3 - 1), and therefore cannot contain the homomorphic image of a cyclic torus of SLn(q) of order q2 - 1, unless [formula], i.e. q = 2; but in PSL3(2) we have already found a different non-QSI character. Finally, if n = 2 the dihedral group M contains no elements of order [formula], unless q  ≤  5, in which case we end up with S  =  A5 or a solvable group.

Similarly, the subgroups of type O-2n / r(qr) or GUn(q) in S  =  PΩ-2n(q) cannot contain a primitive prime divisor of q2n - 2 - 1, and for the only Zsigmondy exception (n,q)  =  (4,2) we can check directly that no maximal subgroup has order divisible by 7 and 17.

For S  =  PΩ2n + 1(q), M of type [formula], there are homomorphic images of cyclic tori of order qn - 1 that are no longer contained in M. (Alternatively, in M  =  Ω-2n(q).2 we can use the descent argument mentioned above, and reduce to the previous case)

In case PSp2n(q), the C3-subgroups lose primitive prime divisors of q2n - 2 - 1, with Zsigmondy exceptions only for n = 2 or (n,q)  =  (4,2). Here we only have to consider the groups of type Sp2n / r(qr), as the other type appears only for n odd. Now M  =  PSp4(4).4  ≤  PSp8(2) loses the prime factor 7, while [formula] always has a non-abelian simple socle, hence the usual descent argument applies. The C8-case yields M  =  Ω-2n(q).2, as in the previous case.

In PSUn(q), with n odd, the C3-subgroups M lose a primitive prime divisor of q2(n - 2) - 1, with Zsigmondy exceptions only for (n,q)  =  (5,2) (which once again can be excluded directly), or n  =  3 and q a Mersenne prime. But here [formula] divides 3, so for QSI-property, q + 1 would have to be a power of 3, which cannot hold for q a Mersenne prime. If n is even, the C1-subgroups M lose a factor qn - 1, i.e. a primitive prime divisor of qn - 1 or qn / 2 - 1 is missing, depending on whether 4 does or does not divide n. There are no Zsigmondy exceptions here as the exponent is either odd or divisible by 4.

S  =  PΩ+n(q), the groups of type [formula] or [formula] can be ruled out by the descent argument, as conjugates of x are only contained in the nonsolvable component. The same argument applies for the exceptional cases in S  =  PΩ+8(q). In the C3-subgroups of type GUn(q) (which occur only for n even), we lose a primitive prime divisor of qn - 1 - 1, and similarly in those of type On(q2) (only for n odd) a primitive prime divisor of q2(n - 2) - 1, with the one exception (n,q)  =  (5,2), where we can check directly that no proper subgroup has order divisible by 31 and 17.

Proof for exceptional Lie type groups

For the exceptional Lie type groups we choose elements x as generators of certain maximal tori. To be more precise, we follow Weigel ([\cite=W1], table 1), and choose the cyclic maximal tori given there together with their respective normalizers . Let x̂ be the corresponding element in the simply-connected version Ŝ  =  Ssc of S (which is in many cases the same as S here).

Let S be one of the groups 3D4(q), 2B2(q) (q = 22n + 1,n  ≥  1), 2F4(q) (q = 22n + 1,n  ≥  1), 2G2(q) (q = 32n + 1,n  ≥  1), G2(q) (q > 2). Let Sm  ≤  G  ≤  Aut(Sm). Then G is QSI.

For all these groups the structure of maximal subgroups is known (see [\cite=Co1] (Theorems 2.3 and 2.4), [\cite=Kl1] (Theorems A and C), [\cite=Kl2] (Theorem 1), [\cite=Ma1] (Main Theorem), [\cite=Su1] (Theorem 9)). In the cases 3D4, 2B2, 2G2 and 2F4, due to the choice of x and Zsigmondy, the only maximal overgroup of x is NS(x). This group has the following order:

4  ·  ord(x) in 3D4(q) and 2B2(q)

6  ·  ord(x) in 2G2(q)

12  ·  ord(x) in 2F4(q).

Once again it's easy to see that certain primes other than the field characteristic cannot be contained (any divisor of q - 1 in case 2B2(q)), any odd divisor of q6 - 1 in case 3D4(q), any odd divisor of q - 1 in case 2G2(q), any divisor of q3 + 1 in case 2F4(q)). In case G2(q), for n  ≥  5, [\cite=W1], 4d), yields SU3(q).2 as the only maximal subgroup of x, and here no odd prime divisor of q3 - 1 is contained. This leaves the cases [formula]. One checks directly that G2(4) has no maximal subgroups containing each of the prime divisors 3, 5, 7 and 13. G2(3) does have maximal subgroups containing all the necessary prime divisors, namely such of type PSL2(13), but elements of order 8 are missing here.

Let S be one of E6(q), 2E6(q), E7(q), E8(q), F4(q). Let Sm  ≤  G  ≤  Aut(Sm). Then G is not QSI.

We gather from [\cite=W1], chapter 4, f)-j), (or, for the few cases excluded in [\cite=W1]: from [\cite=GK], table 4) the maximal subgroups M of S containing a cyclic torus [formula], as chosen in table [\ref=exctab]. In case S  =  F4(q), for q  ≠  2, it always holds that [formula]. In case S  =  E6(q) we have [formula]   In case S  =  2E6(q) we get [formula]. For S  =  E7(q), and q  ≠  2, we get [formula], and in case S  =  E8(q) it always holds that [formula]. In each case one easily obtains some missing prime divisors just by checking the orders of the groups S. The last remaining cases are S  =  F4(2) and E7(2). Here we deviate from the standard choice in table [\ref=exctab] for our choice of elements x: In E7(2), by [\cite=GK], tab.4, there is a conjugacy class of elements x of order 129  =  27 + 1, contained only in maximal subgroups of type [formula] - namely Singer elements of the unitary group GU7(2)  ≤  SU8(2). Analogously, in F4(2) there is a conjugacy class of self-centralizing elements of order 17  =  24 + 1, contained only in maximal subgroups of type [formula] (namely Singer elements of these groups). As the subgroups are also over characteristic 2, we can use the results from the "'classical group"' section.

Now, by the classification of finite simple groups, all cases have been treated, and theorem [\ref=Hauptsatz] has been proven. After checking the few cases where a simple group can be a Lie type group in different defining characteristics, or an alternating and Lie type group at the same time (cf. [\cite=MSW], Prop. 2.9.1), we can also summarize the results about Steinberg characters in the following

Let S  =  S(n,pr) be a finite non-abelian simple group of Lie type in defining characteristic p. Then its Steinberg character is QSI if and only if [formula], PSL2(7), PSL3(2) or PSp4(3)..

Finite groups of Lie type

In table [\ref=T2] we summarize the orders of the simply-connected versions Lsc of the finite groups of Lie type, and the orders of their centers respectively. The group Lsc / Z(Lsc) is then, with only a few excpeptions, a simple group.
