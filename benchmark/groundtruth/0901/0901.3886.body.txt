Recovery of free energy branches in single molecule experiments

Recent developments in statistical physics [\cite=Jarzynski:1997yh] have provided new methods to extract equilibrium free energy differences in small systems from measurements of the mechanical work in irreversible processes (see [\cite=kurchan:2007uh] [\cite=ritort:2008ik] for reviews). In this regard, fluctuation relations [\cite=kurchan:2007uh] are generic identities that establish symmetry properties for the probability of exchanging a given amount of energy between the system and its environment along irreversible processes. If a system, initially in thermodynamic equilibrium, is strongly perturbed by fast varying a control parameter λ between two values λ0 and λ1, then the system is driven out of equilibrium. The work exerted upon the system, averaged over the ensemble of all possible trajectories, reads [formula] where H is the system Hamiltonian. According to the second law of thermodynamics, 〈W〉 is always greater than the free energy difference between the initial and final states, ΔG = G(λ1) - G(λ0). The Crooks fluctuation relation [\cite=Crooks:2000ez] extends the predictive power of the Second Law by establishing a symmetry relation for arbitrary functionals of a trajectory Γ measured along a nonequilibrium process (forward or F process) and its time reversed one (reverse or R process). In the forward process the system starts in equilibrium at λ0 and λ is varied from λ0 to λ1 for a time tf according to an arbitrary protocol λ(t) (i.e., λ1  =  λ(tf)). In the reverse process the system starts in equilibrium at λ1 and λ is varied from λ1 to λ0 following the time reversed scheme, given by λ(tf - t). In its most general form the Crooks fluctuation relation reads [\cite=Crooks:2000ez]

[formula]

where F stands for an arbitrary functional of the forward trajectories the system can take through phase space, β is the inverse of the thermal energy [formula] where [formula] is the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature of the environment. In this relation, [formula] is the time reversal of F, while the averages [formula] are taken over the ensemble of all possible forward (reverse) trajectories. The particular case F  =  δ(W - W(Γ)) yields a relation between work distributions along the forward and reverse processes, [formula]. This relation has been experimentally tested and used to extract free energy differences in single molecule experiments [\cite=Hummer:2001] [\cite=Collin:2005rb] [\cite=Imparato:2008]. A thorough discussion on its validity domain can be found in [\cite=Crooks:2000ez]

Fluctuation relation under partial equilibrium conditions.

By considering only the trajectories that go from one specific subset of configurations to another one, Maragakis et al. [\cite=Maragakis:2008hj] have derived another relation useful to extract free energy differences between subsets of states. In principle, the validity of Eq. ([\ref=cro]) is restricted to initial conditions that are Gibbsian over the whole phase space S (what we might call global thermodynamic equilibrium). It is, however, possible to extend Eq. ([\ref=cro]) to the case where the initial state is Gibbsian but restricted over a subset of configurations (what we might call partial thermodynamic equilibrium). A relation mathematically similar to Eq. ([\ref=cro]) can be derived, but involving nonequilibrium processes that are in partial (rather than global) equilibrium. It is useful to rephrase here the derivation in such a way to emphasize the role played by partial equilibrium. As we will see this makes it possible to experimentally determine the free energy of coexisting states for values of λ such that the system is never globally equilibrated.

Let Peqλ,(C) denote the partially equilibrated (i.e., Boltzmann-Gibbs) distribution for a given value of λ. Such distribution is restricted over a subset [formula] of configurations C contained in S (i.e., C∈  ⊆  S). The case   =  S corresponds to global equilibrium: [formula]. Partially equilibrated states satisfy [formula], where [formula] is the characteristic function defined over the subset [formula] ([formula] if C∈ and zero otherwise), and Zλ, is the partition function restricted to the subset [formula], i.e., [formula], with Eλ(C) the energy function of the system for a given λ and C. Given a forward trajectory Γ, going from configuration C0 when λ  =  λ0 to C1 for λ  =  λ1, let S0 (S1) be the subset of S over which the system is partially equilibrated at λ0 (λ1). Consider now the following transformation of the functional F in Eq. ([\ref=cro]): F(Γ)  →  χS0(C0)F(Γ)χS1(C1). Under previous conditions the following identity can be proved (see Supp. Mat.):

[formula]

where the average [formula] is now restricted to forward (reverse) trajectories that start in partially equilibrated state S0 (S1) at λ0 (λ1) and end in S1 (S0) at λ1 (λ0). [formula] ([formula]) stands for the probability to be in S1 (S0) at the end of the forward (reverse) process defined above, and ΔGS1,λ1S0,λ0 = GS1(λ1) - GS0(λ0) is the free energy difference between partially equilibrated states S0 and S1. In the following, we will drop the subscript (F, R), leaving the direction of the arrow to distinguish forward from reverse. Moreover, we will adopt the shorthand notation [formula]. If F = 1 we obtain a generalization of the Jarzynski equality, PS1S0〈 exp [ -   β(W  -  ΔGS1,λ1S0,λ0)]〉 = 1. Whereas for the particular case F  =  δ(W - W(Γ)), we get the relation

[formula]

which has been used in [\cite=Maragakis:2008hj] in the case of global equilibrium initial conditions.

Experimental test.

Here we test the validity of Eq. ([\ref=jun]) by performing single molecule experiments using optical tweezers. Let us consider an experiment where force is applied to the ends of a DNA hairpin that unfolds/refolds in a two-state manner. The conformation of the hairpin can be characterized by two states, the unfolded state (U) and the native or folded state (N) -- see Fig. [\ref=fig1]. The thermodynamic state of the molecule can be controlled by moving the position of the optical trap relative to a pipette (Fig. [\ref=fig2], upper panel). The relative position of the trap along the x-axis defines the control parameter in our experiments, λ  =  x. Depending on the value of x the molecule switches between the two states according to a rate that is a function of the instantaneous force applied to the molecule [\cite=Evans:1997np]. In a ramping protocol the value of x is changed at constant pulling speed from an initial value x0 (where the molecule is always folded) to a final value x1 (where the molecule is always unfolded) and the force f (measured by the optical trap) versus distance x curves recorded. By computing i) the fraction of forward trajectories (i.e., increasing x) that go from N ([formula]) at x0 to U ([formula]) at x and ii) the fraction of reverse trajectories (decreasing extension) that go from U at x to N at x0, we can determine PUN. Then by measuring the corresponding work values for each of these trajectories, we can use Eq. ([\ref=jun]) to estimate the free energy of the unfolded branch GU(x) as a function of x. By repeating the same operation with N instead of U, the free energy of the folded branch GN(x) can be measured as well. Note that we adopt the convention of measuring all free energies with respect to the free energy GN(x0) of the native state at x0. We are also able to compute the free energy difference between the two branches, ΔGUN(x) = GU(x) - GN(x).

We have pulled a 20 bps DNA hairpin using a miniaturized dual-beam laser optical tweezers apparatus [\cite=hairpin]. Molecules have been pulled at two low pulling speeds (40 and 50 nm/s) and two fast pulling speeds (300 and 400 nm/s), corresponding to average loading rates ranging between 2.6 and 26 pN/s, from x0 = 0 to x1 = 110.26 nm (for convenience we take the initial value of the relative distance trap-pipette equal to 0). A few representative force-distance curves are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig2] (inset of lower panel). We have then selected a value x = x̄ = 61.75 nm, close to the expected coexistence value of x where both N and U states have the same free energy (see below). Such value of x is chosen in order to have good statistics for the evaluation of the unfolding and refolding work distributions. The system is out of equilibrium at the four pulling speeds. To extract the free energy of the unfolded branch GU(x̄), we have measured the work values [formula], [formula] along the unfolding and refolding trajectories, respectively, and then determined the distributions PN  →  U(W) and [formula]. In the main panel of Fig. [\ref=fig2] we show the work distributions obtained for a slow and fast pulling process. Note that the support of the unfolding work distributions is bounded by the maximum amount of work that can be exerted on a molecule between x0 and x̄. This bound corresponds to the work of those unfolding trajectories that have never unfolded before reaching x̄.

As a direct test of the validity of Eq. ([\ref=jun]), in the upper panel of Fig. [\ref=fig3] we plot the quantity [formula] against W (in [formula] units). As expected, all data fall into straight lines of slope close to 1. The intersections of such lines with the W-axis provide an estimate of GU(x̄). Note that both fast and slow pulling speeds intercept the horizontal axis around the same value within 0.75 [formula] of error. With this method, we estimate [formula]. Note that this free energy estimate, as all the others in this paper, refers to the whole system, comprising hairpin, handles, and trap.

A more accurate test of the validity of Eq. ([\ref=jun]) and a better estimation [\cite=Shirts:2003ok] of the free energy GU(x̄) can be obtained through the Bennett acceptance ratio method [\cite=Bennett:1976ju]. In Bennett's method we define the following functions:

[formula]

From Eq. ([\ref=jun]) it has been proved [\cite=Bennett:1976ju] [\cite=Shirts:2003ok] that the solution of the equation z(u) = u, where

[formula]

is the optimal (minimal variance) estimate of GU(x̄).

In Fig. [\ref=fig3] (lower panel) we plot the function z(u) for different pulling speeds. It is quite clear that the functions z(u) are approximately constant along the u axis and cross the line z = u around the same value GU(x̄) = 186.0(3). A distinctive aspect of Eq. ([\ref=jun]) is the presence of the factor PUN. If such correction was not taken into account then the fluctuation relation would not be satisfied anymore. We have verified that if PUN is not included in the analysis, then the Bennett acceptance ratio method gives free energy estimates that depend on the pulling speed (see Supp. Mat.).

Free energy branches.

After having verified that the fluctuation relation Eq. ([\ref=jun]) holds and that it can be used to extract the free energy of the unfolded (GU(x̄)) and folded (GN(x̄), data not shown) branches, we have repeated the same procedure in a wide range of x values. The range of values of x is such that at least 8 trajectories go through N (or U) (ensuring that we get a reasonable statistical significance). The results of the reconstruction of the free energy branches are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig4]. The two free energy branches cross each other at a coexistence value xc at which the two states (N and U) are equally probable. This is defined by ΔGUN(xc) = 0. We get [formula] nm, which is in good agreement with another estimate, [formula] nm, obtained interpreting experimental data according to a simple phenomenological model (see Supp. Mat.). In the insets of Fig. [\ref=fig4] we zoom the crossing region. It is interesting to recall again the importance of the aforementioned correction term (PUN) to Eq. ([\ref=jun]). If such term is not included in the analysis then the two reconstructed branches never cross (bottom right inset). This result is incompatible with the existence of the unfolding/refolding transition in the hairpin, showing that the factor PUN is key to measure free energy branches.

Equation ([\ref=cro2]) is valid in the very general situation of partially equilibrated initial states which, however, are arbitrarily far from global equilibrium. This makes the particular case Eq. ([\ref=jun]) a very useful identity to recover the free energy of states that cannot be observed in conditions of thermodynamic global equilibrium. We have shown how it is possible to apply Eq. ([\ref=jun]) to recover free energy differences of thermodynamic branches of folded and unfolded states in a two-state DNA hairpin. These methods can be further extended to the recovery of free energies of non-native states such as misfolded or intermediates states.
