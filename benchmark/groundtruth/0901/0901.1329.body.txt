Mazurkiewicz manifolds and homogeneity

The classical Hurewicz-Menger-Tumarkin theorem in dimension theory says that connected topological n-manifolds (with or without boundary) are Cantor manifolds (i. e., no subset of covering dimension ≤  n - 2 separates the space). The theorem was almost immediately strengthened by Mazurkiewicz who proved that regions (i. e., open connected subsets) in Euclidean spaces (and, in fact, in topological manifolds) cannot be cut by subsets of codimension at least two (a subset cuts if its complement is not continuum-wise connected [\cite=E]). The Hurewicz-Menger-Tumarkin theorem has many generalizations. In particular, it is known that regions of homogeneous locally compact metric spaces are Cantor manifolds (including their infinite-dimensional versions) [\cite=Kr] [\cite=Kr1]. It was proved in [\cite=HT] that no weakly infinite-dimensional subset cuts the product of a countable number of nondegenerate metric continua.

In this paper, we obtain a generalization in spirit of the Mazurkiewicz theorem: regions in homogeneous locally compact, locally connected metric spaces cannot be cut by Fσ-subsets of codimension at least two. Moreover, our result holds true for a very general dimension function DK considered in [\cite=KKTV] which captures the covering dimension, cohomological dimension dim G with respect to any Abelian group G as well as the extraordinary dimension dim L with respect to a given CW-complex L, and has its counterparts in infinite dimensions including C-spaces and weakly infinite-dimensional spaces.

Basic facts on Cantor manifolds and their stronger variations with respect to dimension DK or to the above-mentioned infinite dimensions has been presented in [\cite=KKTV]. We recall some necessary terminology and results from that paper. We restrict our considerations to metrizable spaces.

A sequence K  =  {K0,K1,..} of CW-complexes is called a stratum for a dimension theory [\cite=dr] if

for each space X admitting a perfect map onto a metrizable space, Kn∈AE(X) implies both [formula] and Kn + j∈AE(X) for all j  ≥  0.

Here, Kn∈AE(X) means that Kn is an absolute extensor for X. Given a stratum K, the dimension function DK for a metrizable space X is defined as follows:

DK(X) =  - 1 iff [formula];

DK(X)  ≤  n if Kn∈AE(X) for n  ≥  0; if DK(X)  ≤  n and [formula] for all m < n, then DK(X) = n;

DK(X) =   ∞   if DK(X)  ≤  n is not satisfied for any n.

According to the countable sum theorem in extension theory, it follows directly from the above definition that DK(X)  ≤  n implies DK(A)  ≤  n for any Fσ-subset A  ⊂  X.

Henceforth, C will denote one of the four classes of metrizable spaces:

the class DkK of at most k-dimensional spaces with respect to dimension DK,

the class D<    ∞K of strongly countable DK-dimensional spaces, i.e. all spaces represented as a countable union of closed finite-dimensional subsets with respect to DK,

the class [formula] of C-spaces,

and

the class [formula] of weakly infinite-dimensional spaces.

(for definitions of a weakly (strongly) infinite-dimensional or of a C-space, see [\cite=E]).

A metrizable space X is a Cantor manifold with respect to a class C if X cannot be separated by a closed subset which belongs to C.

X is a Mazurkiewicz manifold with respect to C if for every two closed, disjoint subsets X0,X1  ⊂  X, both having non-empty interiors in X, and every Fσ-subset F  ⊂  X with F∈C, there exists a continuum in [formula] joining X0 and X1.

Obviously, Mazurkiewicz manifolds with respect to C are Cantor manifolds with respect to C. It was observed in [\cite=KKTV] that if no Fσ-subset from a class C cuts a compact space X, then X is a Mazurkiewicz manifold with respect to C; the converse implication holds for locally connected compact spaces X.

We are going to use the following theorem from [\cite=KKTV].

Let Z be a metric compact space and Z∉C, where C is any of the following four classes: [formula], [formula], Dn - 2K, D<    ∞K. In the case C  =  Dn - 2K we additionally assume DK(Z) = n and in the case C  =  D<    ∞K assume that Z does not contain closed subsets of arbitrary large finite dimension DK. Then Z contains a Mazurkiewicz manifold with respect to C.

We also need the following version of the Effros' theorem (see [\cite=Kr1]).

If X is a homogeneous locally compact metric space (with metric ρ), then for every a∈X and ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that if ρ(x,a) < δ, then there is an ε-homeomorphism h:X  →  X (i. e., ρ(h(y),y) < ε for each y) such that h(a) = x.

The following Lemma is a slight generalization of [\cite=Ku].

If X is a locally compact, locally connected metric space and the union [formula] cuts a region U of X, where Fi is a closed subset of U for each i, then there is i such that Fi cuts a region V  ⊂  U.

Choose two distinct points a,b∈U such that [formula] cuts U between them. Suppose no set Fi cuts any subregion of U. So, there is a subregion [formula] containing a and b. Since U1 is completely metrizable, it is arcwise connected (by the Mazurkiewicz-Moore-Menger theorem [\cite=Ku]), hence there is an arc α1  ⊂  U1 from a to b. The local compactness and local connectedness allows us to get a region U1' such that [formula] and [formula] is compact. Similarly, we find an arc α2 from a to b and regions [formula] and U2' such that [formula] and [formula] is compact. Continuing this way, we get a decreasing sequence of continua [formula] whose intersection is a continuum in [formula] containing a and b, a contradiction.

We can now prove our main result.

Let X be a homogeneous locally compact, locally connected metric space. Suppose U is a region in X and U∉C, where C is one of the above four classes. In case C  =  Dn - 2K assume DK(U) = n. Then U is a Mazurkiewicz manifold with respect to C.

Notice that U is second countable. It follows (by the countable sum theorem for spaces in class C) that U contains compact sets of arbitrary small diameters which do not belong to C. Suppose U is not a Mazurkiewicz manifold with respect to C and let an Fσ-subset [formula] of U cut U with each Fi∈C being closed in U. It follows by Lemma [\ref=lemma] that there is j such that Fj cuts a region V  ⊂  U. Thus, Fj also separates V since V is locally connected [\cite=Ku]. Without loss of generality one can assume that Fj is nowhere dense. Let [formula], where V1 and V2 are nonempty, open and disjoint. Fix a point [formula].

Assume first that in the case C  =  D<    ∞K the region U does not contain closed subsets of arbitrary large finite dimension DK. Then, by Theorem [\ref=exist], there are arbitrary small compact Mazurkiewicz manifolds with respect to C in U. By the homogeneity, there is a compact Mazurkiewicz manifold (with respect to C) M  ⊂  V containing a. M being a Cantor manifold with respect to C, it is not in C, so M is not contained in Fj. Suppose M intersects V1. Then the Effros' Theorem [\ref=effros] allows us to push M toward V2 by a small homeomorphism so that it meet both sets V1 and V2. This means that the displaced M is separated by Fj, a contradiction.

The case when C  =  D<    ∞K and U contains closed subsets of arbitrary large finite dimension DK can be handled in a similar way. Indeed, let DK(Fj) = m and observe that, by the σ-compactness of U and by the countable sum theorem for dimension DK, we can assume that these closed subsets are compact and of arbitrary small diameters. By Theorem [\ref=exist] they contain arbitrary small compact Mazurkiewicz manifolds with respect to corresponding finite dimensions DK. Thus there are arbitrary small compact Cantor manifolds with respect to Dk - 2K in U for some k > m + 2. By the homogeneity, there is such a Cantor manifold M  ⊂  U containing a. Now, using the Effros' Theorem [\ref=effros], we get a contradiction as in the previous paragraph.
