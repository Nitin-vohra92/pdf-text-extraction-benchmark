Phase preserving amplification near the quantum limit with a Josephson Ring Modulator

Recent progress in solid state quantum information processing has stimulated the search for ultra-low-noise amplifiers and frequency converters in the microwave frequency range, which could attain the ultimate limit imposed by quantum mechanics. In this article, we report the first realization of an intrinsically phase-preserving, non-degenerate superconducting parametric amplifier, a so far missing component. It is based on the Josephson ring modulator, which consists of four junctions in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. The device symmetry greatly enhances the purity of the amplification process and simplifies both its operation and analysis. The measured characteristics of the amplifier in terms of gain and bandwidth are in good agreement with analytical predictions. Using a newly developed noise source, we also show that our device operates within a factor of three of the quantum limit. This development opens new applications in the area of quantum analog signal processing.

In this article, we focus on parametric amplifiers which are powered by an ac source with frequency fp also known as the "pump". Such amplifiers operate with a minimal number of degrees of freedom and are the natural candidates for ultra low noise operation [\cite=louisell] [\cite=gordon]. A single spatial and temporal mode of the electromagnetic field with carrier frequency f can be decomposed into its in-phase [formula] and out-of-phase [formula] quadratures. Linear amplifiers can be classified into two categories from the way they treat these two quadratures. On one hand, a phase-preserving amplifier treats both quadrature components with the same gain ([formula]) as an ordinary op-amp would do ([formula] ; [formula]). On the other hand, in a phase-sensitive amplifier, the gains of the quadratures are inverse of each other ([formula]; [formula]). Regarding their noise properties, there is a fundamental difference between these two types of amplifiers. The minimum noise energy added by a phase-preserving amplifier to the input signal amounts to half a photon at the signal frequency [formula], where h is Planck's constant [\cite=haus] [\cite=caves] [\cite=clerk]. On the other hand, a phase-sensitive amplifier is submitted to only a lower limit on the product of the noise added to the two quadratures and can thus squeeze the quantum noise on one quadrature at the expense of extra noise in the other [\cite=caves] [\cite=castellanos]. Although such amplifiers can look rather appealing because of their ability to operate potentially below the quantum limit, they are only useful in cases where a reference phase is attached to the signal, like in homodyne detection. In the majority of cases, where the information carried by the signal is contained in both quadratures, or equivalently in both amplitude and phase, a phase-preserving amplifier is preferable. However, so far, little attention has been devoted to non-degenerate, intrinsically phase-preserving, parametric amplifiers operating near the quantum limit in the microwave frequency range. They involve two distinct internal resonant modes of the circuit, conventionally called the "signal" with center frequency fs and the "idler", whose frequency fi differs from fs by at least the sum of the bandwidth of the two resonances. This is in contrast with phase-sensitive degenerate parametric amplifiers which operate with one internal resonant mode only [\cite=lehnert] [\cite=yamamoto] [\cite=yurke88] [\cite=yurke89] [\cite=movshovich]. The challenge of building phase-preserving amplifiers arises from the difficulty of controlling the two modes and coupling them together with the pump.

Description of the Josephson Parametric Converter

The circuit nicknamed Josephson Parametric Converter (JPC) has been theoretically described in reference [\cite=bergeal]. A schematic description can be found in the red solid line box of Fig. 1a. Its operation is based on a novel non-linear device, the Josephson ring modulator, consisting of four nominally identical Josephson junctions forming a superconducting loop [\cite=bergeal]. It has the minimal number of electromagnetic spatial modes required to perform 3-wave mixing: two differential ones, called X and Y, and a common one, called Z. In the JPC, two superconducting resonators, A and B, couple to the differential modes X and Y of the ring, respectively. In the following, fa(b) and Qa(b) denote the resonant frequencies and quality factors of the resonators. An additional transmission line carries the pump signal at frequency fp, and is weakly coupled to the common mode Z of the ring through capacitances. From the point of view of the signals, the device has two ports: port 1, driven at frequency f1, feeds resonator A and port 2, driven at frequency f2, feeds resonator B. In contrast with previous Josephson parametric amplifier, we have here a complete separation of the signal and idler modes both spatially and temporally. The JPC can be operated as a phase-preserving amplifier when fp = f1 + f2 or as a unity photon gain frequency converter when fp = |f2 - f1|. In this paper, we will focus only on the amplification mode, in which case the JPC is described by the input-output relation [\cite=bergeal]

[formula]

The â1(2) and [formula] are annihilation and creation operators at port 1 (frequency f1) and port 2 (frequency f2), expressed in units of the square root of photon number per unit time. Relations (1) and (2) thus determine the properties of the amplifier including its noise in the quantum limit.

The coefficients r1(2) and s1(2) satisfy the symplectic relation |r1(2)|2 - |s1(2)|2 = 1. They are given by

[formula]

where [formula], and [formula].

Here, we have introduced the dimensionless pump current |ρ|

[formula]

where Ip is the pump current, I'0 is the Z mode critical current and [formula] are the participation ratios of the inductance of the Josephson ring modulator LJ to the resonator inductances La(b) [\cite=bergeal]. At the resonant tuning f1 = fa and f2 = fb, the expressions of the coefficients reduce to [formula] and [formula]. The symbol G refers to the power gain at the band center.

The diagonal term r1(2) can be seen as a photon "cis-gain", characteristic of the 1-port reflection amplifier operation : the incoming wave at either port is reflected with a power gain |r1(2)|2 and its phase is preserved. The non-diagonal term s1(2) can be seen as a photon "trans-gain" between the two ports, and describes the behaviour of a frequency converter (f1  →  f2 or f2  →  f1) with power gain |s1(2)|2 = |r1(2)|2 - 1. The possibility of performing the important function of up- and down-conversion is another feature that distinguishes the non-degenerate parametric amplifier from the degenerate one. It arises from the presence in the circuit of two different spatial modes with different frequencies, whose sum is equal to the pump frequency. The "cis-gain" and "trans-gain" can be varied simply by changing the pump power through the |ρ| parameter, [formula]. In the large gain limit, the expressions of |r1,2| and |s1,2| reduce to a Lorentzian form

[formula]

The -3dB bandwidth of the amplifier is thus

[formula]

Implementation and characterisation of the JPC

Fig. 1b-d show pictures of our JPC sample made of Aluminium on a Si wafer, using a three-step fabrication process combining optical and e-beam lithography. The details of fabrication are given in the Methods section. The two resonators A and B are 17 mm and 3.6 mm long. The four junctions of the ring have nominally identical critical currents with values in the range 3-6μA. Tests have shown that these values vary from one junction of the ring to another by less than 5 %. The center frequencies of the resonators are slightly renormalized by the Josephson inductance LJ of the ring and are, in absence of flux through the ring, fa=1.6 GHz and fb=7.3 GHz. The choice of these frequencies results from a compromise between separation of signal and idler for frequency conversion, and complexity of microwave engineering. Our resonators are both in the overcoupled regime and the quality factors are therefore determined by the overlap coupling capacitances connecting the resonators to the external circuit. Here, the values Qa=450 and Qb=120 result from favouring capacitor reliability and have not been optimized for maximum amplifier performances. After fabrication, the JPC chip is mounted on a microwave circuit board and housed in a copper sample box equipped with a superconducting coil. The sample box is anchored to the 280 mK cold stage of a 3He refrigerator and placed in a magnetic shield. Although similar embedding of μA critical current junctions inside microwave resonators have recently been employed for bifurcation readout of qubits [\cite=mike] [\cite=boulant] and RF magnetometry [\cite=vijay], the ring modulator device investigated here works in the weakly non-linear regime, with the pump amplitude well below the bifurcation threshold. In other words, the currents in the ring modulator remain small enough that only second order correction to the Josephson inductance need to be considered. A schematic description of our measurement set-up is shown in Fig. 1a. Two attenuated input lines carry the signal from the microwave generators to the JPC. Circulators separate the output signal reflected by the JPC from the input signal at the coldest stage. The output signals are first amplified by HEMT cryogenic amplifiers at the 4.2K stage. Two isolators are placed at the 4.2K and 1.6K stages to minimize the backaction of the amplifier on the sample. In this arrangement, the incoming noise at the input ports of the JPC arises from the 50 Ω resistance presented by the last attenuator in the input lines. At room temperature, the signal is further amplified by about 60 dB before being measured. The frequency bands of the output lines are limited by the isolators, circulators and amplifiers: 1.2-1.8 GHz for the low frequency (f1) line and 4-8 GHz for the high frequency (f2) line.

We characterized our resonators with a vector network analyzer. In the reflection measurements, there was no amplitude response and the resonance frequencies, showed up only in the phase response which displayed a complete 2π phase shift, confirming the completely dispersive nature of the device. Then, we followed the phase response as a function of the dc current applied to the coil which is proportional to magnetic flux Φ through the ring. As expected, we observe Φ0-periodic modulations of the resonance frequency (Fig. 2) which are hysteretic with the magnetic field (Φ0 denotes the superconducting flux quantum). According to Fig. 1b of reference [\cite=bergeal], the two lower energy states cross each other for a flux bias [formula]. However, as the two states are separated by an energy barrier, the system initially in the ground state for Φ = 0 becomes metastable when the flux is increased beyond [formula]. As the barrier is maximum at the degeneracy point and decreases to zero at Φ0, the system remains in the metastable state until its environment (noise, measurement signal) provides a sufficient amount of energy to activate the transition. The operation of the JPC is optimal when biased in the vicinity of [formula] [\cite=bergeal]. In the following, we will focus on measurements performed at this bias point where the resonance frequencies where found to be fa=1.631 GHz and fb=7.219 GHz.

Operation of the JPC

The device was operated in the amplifier mode by feeding the pump line with a continuous microwave signal at a fixed frequency fp = fa + fb = 8.85 GHz. In this mode, the JPC is described by relations (1) and (2). Fig. 3a shows the gain curves |r1(2)|2 measured at both ports for different values of the pump power. They are symmetrically centered on the resonance frequencies fa and fb and, importantly, the symmetry of the ring modulator is such that they do not shift noticeably with the pump power, unlike in other Josephson parametric amplifiers [\cite=lehnert] [\cite=yamamoto] [\cite=yurke89]. In addition to the experimental data, we also plot the theoretical expression ([\ref=ex_gain]) for |r1(2)|2 as a function of drive frequencies f1(2), using the values of fa, fb, Qa and Qb measured previously. Data and theory are in very good agreement up to 40 dB. This is quite remarkable since only one adjustable parameter |ρ| is sufficient to capture the whole shape of the gain curves. In particular the relationship ([\ref=ex_b]) between gain and bandwidth is well satisfied. A similar agreement with theory is also obtained for the phase of the complex gain r1(2) as shown in supplementary figure 1. As far as the relationship between |ρ| and Ip is concerned, we found experimentally that, for a wide range of gain, [formula]. This dependence differs from the linear relation ([\ref=rho]) obtained in the framework of reference [\cite=bergeal] assuming a stiff pump, an ideal situation difficult to realize in practice since the coupling of the pump mode changes as the gain increases. When the gain is further increased to a maximum of 44 dB, the curves deviates from the model as reported in insets of Fig. 3a, showing that saturation effects are becoming important, as discussed below. These effects occur within a fraction of a percent from the theoretical onset of self-oscillations of the system corresponding to |ρ| = 1. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3c, after reaching its maximum value the gain starts to decrease when further increasing the pump power and finally collapses when the critical current of the junctions is reached. We attribute the failure to observe parametric self-oscillations to the saturation of the device by the signal resulting from the amplification of the noise, whose peak amplitude reaches the critical current.

A practical amplifier must have a minimum gain to beat the noise of the following amplifier in the measurement chain. Assuming the best "state-of-the-art" commercial device as a following amplifier with a noise temperature of a few K, we are led to a requirement of at least 20 dB of power gain, satisfied with a comfortable margin by the present JPC. This is in contrast with recent results obtained with other parametric amplifiers [\cite=lehnert] [\cite=yamamoto] or dc SQUID microwave amplifiers [\cite=spietz] [\cite=kinion]. We believe that the differences in gain performances between our JPC and other Josephson amplifiers originate in the purity of the non linear XYZ coupling of signal, idler and pump offered by the ring modulator. Indeed, the observed maximum gain is compatible with the order-of-magnitude theoretical prediction given by

[formula]

where the participation ratio pa and pb are 0.02 and 0.09 respectively and I0 is 3-6 μA [\cite=bergeal]. The same consideration based on the maximum output power that the Josephson ring modulator can deliver also explains the dynamic range of our amplifier (supplementary figure 2). In addition to the 1-port amplifier operation corresponding to the diagonal terms r1(2), the JPC also performs 2-ports frequency conversion with gain corresponding to the non-diagonal terms s1(2). Fig. 3b shows the typical gain curves measured between the two ports both in the cases of up conversion (f1  →  f2) and down conversion (f2  →  f1). Like with |r1(2)| we obtain an excellent agreement with the theoretical expression of |s1(2)|.

In Fig. 4, we show that we can adjust the center frequency of the signal bandwidth by detuning the pump frequency. Thus, the tuning bandwidth is found to be given by the intrinsic resonator bandwidth [formula] as expression ([\ref=ex_gain]) predicts. For the high frequency port of our device, there is a ratio of 95 between the tuning and signal bandwidth if we limit the gain to 20 dB. For the low frequency port, this ratio is much smaller (5.7) since [formula]. Finally, let us note that the relatively small signal bandwidth of the present device is due to the small intrinsic bandwidth of the low frequency resonator and could be greatly enhanced by increasing its coupling capacitance and the working frequency. The optimum bandwidth configuration occurs when the signal and idler bandwidth are equal.

Noise measurement

To measure the noise of the JPC we have developed a source of noise based on the hot-electron shot noise regime of a R=50±  1 Ω mesoscopic copper resistor of length L = 4μm embedded between two cold reservoirs (inset Fig. 5a). It is inspired by a previous work in which this system was used to calibrate an infrared photon detector [\cite=teufel]. A detailed description of the device is given in the Methods section. This noise source has the following advantages : (i) no macroscopic heating of the sample and thus no perturbation of the JPC operating point (ii) self-calibration (iii) response time in the microsecond range [\cite=teufel] (iv) control by a dc current Idc. The Johnson noise spectral power produced by the resistor is given by

[formula]

where [formula] is the effective electronic temperature of the resistor, a function of the voltage V = RIdc across the resistor, and [formula] the Boltzmann constant. For [formula] this expression reduces to the well known classical Johnson spectral noise power [formula].

In this experiment, both the noise source and the JPC were anchored to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator with base temperature T0 = 17 mK and connected to port 1 via a circulator (supplementary figure 3). Fig. 5a shows the noise in color as a function of frequency and voltage V, with the gain of the JPC set to 30 dB. A cut of data taken at V=0 μV and V=85 μV is shown is Fig. 5b in dB scale. Fig. 5c shows the noise averaged on a 1MHz band around the resonance frequency. In the same figure, we compare the data with the theoretical expression

[formula]

where Gt is the total gain of the measurement chain and [formula] is the noise added by the amplifier. In the case of a perfect quantum limited (QL) amplifier, [formula], which corresponds to the noise brought in by the idler when the load at port 2 is at a temperature T0 such that [formula]. Note that the vertical axis in Fig 5c is the total noise of the system. Yet, it entirely measures the output noise of the JPC since the noise added by the following stages is 17 dB lower, as shown in Fig 5b. There is a good agreement between theory and experimental data if [formula] (red curve). In the same figure, for comparison we plot the theoretical result corresponding to the ideal case of both perfect nanowire and amplifier (black curve). The quality of the fit confirms that the resistor is well in the hot electron regime. For instance, the expression for quantum shot noise (green curve in Fig. 5c, see Methods) cannot been reconciled with the experimental data. In Fig. 5d the voltage axis has been converted into a temperature scale using the expression for [formula] (see Methods). In this figure, we can read directly the noise added by the amplifier as the vertical intercept of the dashed line corresponding to the asymptotic variation of noise with temperature. Converting the added noise [formula] into the system noise temperature, we found TN = 125 mK which makes the JPC 20-40 times better than the best commercial HEMT amplifier. We attribute the difference between the system noise temperature and the ideal quantum limit TN = 37 mK to incomplete isolation of the JPC from spurious noise coming through the post-amplifiers and possibly to imperfections in the line connecting the nanowire to the JPC, which incorporates a circulator and a bias tee.

In conclusion, we have implemented and demonstrated the operation of a new phase-preserving amplifier, the Josephson Parametric Converter, whose main element is the nonlinear, nondissipative inductance of a Josephson ring modulator. Our results concerning the gain, bandwidth and dynamic range can be understood quantitatively using a simple analytical model involving a minimum number of parameters. We have achieved a power gain amplification of at least 40 dB, which opens the possibility of practical applications like single photon detection based on microwave readout [\cite=dan] or any applications involving the measurement of very low microwave power in a limited bandwidth. Our device is also useful as a frequency up-or-down converter. Using a newly developed self-calibrating noise source, we obtained an upper bound on the noise added by the JPC which is three times the quantum limit. Extrapolating the present results to an optimal choice of parameters, we should be able to build a quantum limited amplifier with 20 dB gain in a 10 MHz bandwidth, allowing dispersive single shot readout of solid state qubits with an irradiation of only a few photons [\cite=wallraff] [\cite=majer] [\cite=lupascu] [\cite=sillamaa] [\cite=vlad]. Our results also open the way for production of entangled microwave signal pairs through two-mode squeezing operation.

Methods Fabrication of the device

Each quarter wave resonator is built from a Coplanar Strip Line (CPS) structure consisting of two 15 μm wide parallel lines separated by a 4 μm gap. In the first step of fabrication, a 110 nm thick Al layer is evaporated onto a high resistivity Si wafer through an optical bilayer resist. A slope edge is obtained by tilting the sample holder with an angle of 4[formula] and rotating the stage at the speed of 10[formula]/s during the evaporation. This process defines the CPS resonators and the bottom layer of the input capacitances. Then a 270 nm thick SiOx layer is deposited through a second optical resist to form in a single step, the dielectric layer of the input capacitances, the pump coupling capacitances and the isolation at the crossing of the two resonators line. Finally a second layer of Al (240 nm) is evaporated to form the pump line, the top layer of the input capacitances connected to contact pads, and the bridge on the top of the isolation. After the optical processes, the wafer is diced into 50 chips of size 5×  4 mm2. Next, the Josephson ring modulator is integrated to the device using electron beam lithography, MMA/ PMMA resist bilayer and the Dolan bridge double angle evaporation technique. A gentle hollow cathode ion gun milling was employed between deposition of metallic layers. The nominal size of each junction is 5×  1 μm2 yielding a resistance of tunnel resistance of 40/80Ω depending on oxidation conditions.

Noise measurement with a mesoscopic resistor

A metallic resistor exhibits several regimes of shot noise depending on the relation between its length L and the characteristic length scales involved in the motion of electrons [\cite=steinbach]. In the regime where L is longer than the inelastic electron scattering length Le - e, but shorter than the electron-phonon interaction length Le - ph, the electrons travelling through the resistor redistribute the excess kinetic energy gained from the voltage via electron-electron interactions only [\cite=steinbach]. The cooling of the electrons system thus occurs only by diffusion to the cold reservoirs and is controlled by the Wiedemann-Franz law. As a result, an equilibrium electronic temperature profile establishes itself over the length of the microbridge (inset Fig. 5b) [\cite=nagaev]

[formula]

An effective temperature for the nanowire can be obtained by integrating over its length [formula] where [formula]. We have verified that when computing the effect of shot noise, using this effective temperature and the formula for the Johnson noise gave, at the percent precision level, the same result as when the full space dependent spectral density of noise is taken into account. Our 50 Ω Cu nanowire resistor is 4 μm long, 80 nm wide, and 20 nm thick. Using a double angle evaporation technique, the resistor is embedded into a 500 nm thick 50 Ω CPW transmission line of 400 μm width providing good thermal reservoirs. The noise source chip is bonded with gold wire on a sample holder itself thermally anchored to the mixing chamber of the dilution fridge with base temperature T0=17 mK. According to previous studies [\cite=pothier], the 4 μm length ensures that the resistor is in the hot electron regime Le - e < L < Le - ph at the working temperature. The sample holder is connected to the high-frequency port of a bias tee. Dc current is applied to the noise source using a cold current divider connected to the dc port of the bias tee. Finally, the dc-blocked high frequency port of the bias tee is connected to the port 1 of the JPC via a circulator.
