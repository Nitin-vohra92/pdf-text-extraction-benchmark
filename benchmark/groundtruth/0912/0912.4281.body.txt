High flux expansion divertor studies in NSTX

Introduction Projections for high-performance H-mode scenarios in spherical torus (ST)-based devices assume low electron collisionality for increased efficiency of the neutral beam current drive. At lower collisionality (lower density), the mitigation techniques based on induced divertor volumetric power and momentum losses may not be capable of reducing heat and material erosion to acceptable levels in a compact ST divertor. Divertor geometry can also be used to reduce high peak heat and particle fluxes by flaring a scrape-off layer (SOL) flux tube at the divertor plate, and by optimizing the angle at which the flux tube intersects the divertor plate, or reduce heat flow to the divertor by increasing the length of the flux tube. The recently proposed advanced divertor concepts [\cite=9586707] [\cite=valanju:056110] take advantage of these geometry effects. In a high triangularity ST plasma configuration, the magnetic flux expansion at the divertor strike point (SP) is inherently high, leading to a reduction of heat and particle fluxes and a facilitated access to the outer SP detachment, as has been demonstrated recently in NSTX [\cite=vas-pop09]. The natural synergy of the highly-shaped high-performance ST plasmas with beneficial divertor properties motivated a further systematic study of the high flux expansion divertor.

The National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) is a mid-sized device with the aspect ratio A = 1.3 - 1.5 [\cite=074010841128]. In NSTX, the graphite tile divertor has an open horizontal plate geometry. The divertor magnetic configuration geometry was systematically changed in an experiment by either (i) changing the distance between the lower divertor X-point and the divertor plate (X-point height hX), or by (ii) keeping the X-point height constant and increasing the outer SP radius. An initial analysis of the former experiment is presented below. Since in the divertor the poloidal field Bθ strength is proportional to hX, the X-point height variation changed the divertor plasma wetted area due to variations in a SOL flux expansion, or more generally, area expansion. The flux expansion factor is defined as fexp  =  λSPq  /  λMPq≃(Bθ / Btot)MP  /  (Bθ / Btot)SP, where Btot is the total magnetic field at the strike point RSP and midplane RMP major radii, and λq is the SOL parallel heat flux width. The SOL area expansion factor is fexp  RMP / RSP. Experiment The experiment was carried out in a lower single null configuration, in 1 MA, 6 MW NBI-heated H-mode plasma discharges, fueled by deuterium from a high field side gas injector. Shown in Fig. [\ref=f:one] (a)-(c) are three representative configurations with X-point heights hX  =  18 - 22,9 - 12, and 5-6 cm. For the divertor measurements, infrared thermography, spectrally filtered cameras, a multi-channel UV-visible spectrometer, and Penning and micro-ion neutral pressure gauges were used, as described in detail in [\cite=vas-pop09]. Steady-state configurations with different hX were obtained on a shot to shot basis by shifting the plasma up or down, as shown in Fig. [\ref=f:one] (f). The steady-state shift was accomplished by controlled variations of the divertor PF1A coil current within 10-18 kA (Fig. [\ref=f:one] (e)), while other plasma shaping parameters were kept within a reasonably small range: elongation 2.20-2.40, triangularity 0.7-0.85, and midplane radial distance between the primary and secondary separatrices (drsep) 5 - 12 mm.

Results and discussion Large aspect ratio tokamak divertor experiments have provided insights into the scrape-off layer heat flux variations with X-point height [\cite=6979968] [\cite=6487522] [\cite=6262610] [\cite=6908766]. In this section we summarize the NSTX observations and discuss them in the context of the mentioned results.

Core plasma parameters varied within 10-15 % over the range of the X-point height scan. As shown in Fig. [\ref=f:two] for the medium, low, and high hX, the plasma stored energy remained nearly constant, while the electron density and core carbon density modestly varied. A portion of the variation was due to instrumental effects, as the NSTX Thomson scattering (Te,ne) and charge-echange recombination spectroscopy (nC,Ti) systems probed the plasma at Z = 0.0 m, while the actual plasma center was shifted by 5-10 cm up or down. The small-ELM H-mode regime was maintained regardless of the divertor configuration, with occasional large type I ELMs. The midplane (upstream) SOL Te and ne did not appear to change, remaining in the range 30-50 eV, and 3 - 8  ×  1018 m- 3, respectively.

As expected, hX variations had a profound effect on divertor profiles. Overall, the divertor measurements indicated that as hX was decreased, the conduction-dominated high-recycling SOL developed a higher parallel Te gradient, as the divertor Te apparently decreased, and ne increased. The increase in divertor ne and recombination rate suggested that at the lowest hX, the outer SP region was nearly detached. The profiles shown in Fig. [\ref=f:three] were measured between ELMs during the time interval indicated in Fig. [\ref=f:two], unless indicated otherwise. The heat flux profiles showed a drastic reduction in peak heat flux from qpk=7-8 MW/m2 in the high hX case, down to 1-2 MW/m2 in the lower hX case. The width of the profiles λq also consistently increased with flux expansion. Because of the strong Bθ / Btot variation across the separatrix and the heat diffusion into the private flux region, heat flux profiles do not peak at the separatrix [\cite=4167597]. This was apparent in all hX cases. However, at the lowest hX qpk was several cm away from the separatrix location, suggesting a partial SP detachment. Outside of the divertor SOL, the heat flux did not change, and remained at a level of 0.5-1 MW/m2. The Dα brightness was higher in the outer SP region at lower hX, although the Dα profiles were more difficult to interpret since the X-point region was dominated by emission and could only be partially resolved from the outer SP region (Fig. [\ref=f:three] (b)). Spatially resolved ultraviolet spectra showed the presence of the high-n Balmer series lines. Upper levels of these lines are populated by three-body recombination. Volume recombination took place in all hX cases in the inner divertor, however, the Balmer n = 10 - 2 (B10) line emission intensity increased, and the emission region expanded with lowering the X-point, and spread from the inner divertor and X-point region to the outer SP region, as shown in Fig. [\ref=f:two] (c). This was also consistent with the observed outer SP Dα intensity increase, as part of the increase could be due to recombination. Preliminary analysis of the Balmer series Stark broadening indicated an increase in divertor density to ne  ≤  3  ×  1020 m- 3. Emission from C II and C III also increased in the X-point - outer SP region in the lower hX case (Fig. [\ref=f:three] (d, e)).

Divertor geometry changes resulting from the hX scan are summarized in Fig. [\ref=f:four] (a) and (b). The flux expansion factor decreased from about 26-28 to 6 as hX was changed from 7 to 23 cm. The outer SP moved radially outward by 10 cm over the hX scan. The corresponding area expansion factor decreased from 5.5 (at hX  =  7 cm) to 1.8 (at hX  =  22 cm). The connection length Lc between the midplane and divertor target remained about 15  ±  2 m, while the X-point to target connection length Lx (both calculated at ψN  =  1.001) changed from 2 to 5-6 m. The field line incidence angle γ changed from 1-2 to 4-5 degrees in the hX scan. Divertor qpk was nearly proportional to hX, except in one discharge where heat flux was measured over frequent medium size ELMs, as indicated in Fig. [\ref=f:four] (c). The peak divertor power Qdiv changed weakly between 1.5-2 MW (Fig. [\ref=f:four] (d)), suggesting that some losses were incurred due to increased radiated power at lower hX.

With an orthogonal divertor target orientation (i.e., when flux surfaces are perpendicular to divertor targets, as was the case), the SOL heat flux [formula] is reduced due to the power dissipated in the divertor, conduction and convection losses, and the geometry factor Bθ / Btot [\cite=s00]. In a conduction-dominated SOL, the heat loss due to private flux region diffusion is proportional to the X-point connection length Lx, while the conduction losses are proportional to L4 / 7X [\cite=s00]. Additionally, the fexp variation with hX was much stronger than the LX variation (Fig. [\ref=f:four] (a) and (b)), suggesting that besides the dissipative losses, the flux expansion effect is the dominant effect for heat flux reduction in this divertor configuration. When the peak heat flux qpk is mapped to the midplane, the obtained [formula] is in the range 50-100 MW/m2, being lower at the lower hX. While this result is in qualitative agreement with the large aspect ratio tokamak divertor studies [\cite=6066501], the further clarification of the private flux region diffusion effect in NSTX without accurate accounting of the divertor dissipative losses is difficult. The data suggested that at the lowest hX the divertor radiated power losses were non-negligible, and the strike point was close to detachment. At the medium and high hX, the assumption of the conduction-dominated flux-limited outer SOL regime was supported by this and other NSTX studies [\cite=05098861864] [\cite=072110609441] [\cite=072110609413] [\cite=Ahn2009421] [\cite=10407123].

Variations in the X-point height had measurable effects on divertor particle handling. Lowering hX apparently led to an increased opacity to neutrals. Divertor pressure measurements indicated a nearly linear increase of Pdiv with decreasing hX. Shown in Fig. [\ref=f:three] (e) is the divertor compression factor Pdiv  /  Pmid, a ratio of divertor and midplane neutral pressures. The divertor compression trend and the deuterium emission profiles in Fig. [\ref=f:three] suggested that neutral entrapment ("plugging efficiency") was improved with decreasing hX. The lowest hX case will be analyzed further, as the poloidal length of the divertor leg was approaching several ion gyroradii, while the connection length LX was marginal for efficient ion recombination to occur in the divertor.

In summary, divertor configuration studies by means of the X-point height variation in NSTX showed that in a high triangularity configuration, the poloidal flux expansion could be varied from 6 to 26. The flux expansion factor appeared to play the dominant role in peak divertor heat flux reduction from 7-8 MW/m2 to 1-2 MW/m2. When the X-point height was reduced to several cm, the divertor Te decreased and ne increased, the radiated power and recombination rate increased, suggesting that the strike point region was approaching the detachment state. The X-point variation studies also suggested that a further clarification of the relative roles of various divertor heat reduction and loss mechanisms would be better accomplished experimentally by maintaining a medium X-point height while scanning the flux expansion and outer strike point radius.
