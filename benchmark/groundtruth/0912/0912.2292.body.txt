On the non-existence of orthogonal instanton bundles on [formula]

Introduction

Instanton bundles were introduced in [\cite=ADHM] on [formula] and in [\cite=okon-spin] on [formula]. Recently many authors have been dealing with them. The geometry of special instanton bundles is discussed in [\cite=spin-traut]. Authors of [\cite=anc-ott] study the stability of instanton bundles. They prove that all special symplectic instanton bundles on [formula] are stable and all instanton bundles on [formula] are stable. Some computations involving instanton bundles can be done using computer programs, e.g. Macaulay, as it is presented in [\cite=AABOP]. The SL(2)-action on the moduli space of special instanton bundles on [formula] is described in [\cite=costa-ott2]. In [\cite=costa-ott] it is shown that the moduli space of symplectic instanton bundles on [formula] is affine, by introducing the invariant that we use in this paper.

As we see, instanton bundles were discussed in many papers. On [formula] they have rank 2 and they are symplectic. On [formula], for n  ≥  2, theoretically they can be divided in three groups: symplectic, orthogonal and neither symplectic nor orthogonal bundles. Lots of examples of symplectic bundles are known as well as of bundles from the third group. However, it was not known whether there exist orthogonal instanton bundles. We prove, see Theorem [\ref=mainthm], that it's impossible for such bundles to exist. The question was posed by Trautmann in [\cite=traut].

The paper is organised as follows. In the Preliminaries we give definitions of instanton bundle, orthogonal instanton bundle and symplectic instanton bundle. We state equivalent conditions for a bundle to be respectively orthogonal or symplectic. In the main part we prove the fact that there do not exist orthogonal instanton bundles on [formula] for an arbitrary n and arbitrary k = c2(E).

Preliminaries

Let X be a smooth projective variety. A monad on X is a complex of vector bundles:

[formula]

which is exact at F and at H.

Let V be a vector space of dimension 2n + 2 and [formula]. Let U and I be vector spaces of dimension k and let W be a vector space of dimension 2n + 2k. We consider the following monad on [formula]:

[formula]

Note that α and β can be represented by two matrices A and Bt respectively, where A and B are k  ×  (2n + 2k)-matrices with linear entries of maximal rank for every point in [formula] and A  ·  Bt = 0. The condition for A and B to be of maximal rank for every point in [formula] is equivalent to require that the map α is surjective and the map β is injective.

From now on, with a little abuse of notation, we will identify a linear map α with the matrix A associated to it, and we will simply write A.

We say that E is an instanton bundle (with quantum number k) if E is the cohomology of a monad as in ([\ref=monad]), i.e.

[formula]

Having a symplectic instanton bundle is equivalent to the existence of a non-degenerate, skew-symmetric matrix J such that B = A  ·  J. After linear change of coordinates we may assume that J is of the form

[formula]

and A  ·  J  ·  At = 0.

Having an orthogonal instanton bundle is equivalent to the existence of a non-degenerate, symmetric matrix J such that B = A  ·  J. We may assume that J = I and A  ·  J  ·  At = A  ·  At = 0.

On the non-existence

Recalling the definition we gave before, having an orthogonal instanton bundle means having an application

[formula]

with the additional properties that A  ·  At  =  0, and A has maximal rank for every point in [formula].

Let us choose a basis for each vector space we are considering. In particular we have i1, [formula], ik as a basis of I, w1, [formula], w2n + 2k as a basis of W and v0, [formula], v2n + 1 as a basis of V.

From the map defined in ([\ref=def:1]) we can induce a second map

[formula]

over the global sections where M is a [formula]-matrix.

We want to construct such matrix in a particular way, i.e.

[formula]

where, fixed j, the block Mj is a [formula]-matrix "associated" to the element ij of the basis of I. In other words the block Mj represents the following correspondence:

[formula]

Using the matrix M it is possible to reconstruct the quadratic conditions given by A  ·  At  =  0. Indeed, let us observe that the matrix A can be described by the following matrix

[formula]

where xi are the coordinates in V with respect to the basis {v0, [formula], v2n + 1}.

The most natural idea is to consider the product M  ·  Mt, that is of the form

[formula]

where each block Mα  ·  Mtβ, for α, β = 1, [formula], k, is a square matrix representing a quadratic form in the variables x0, [formula], x2n + 1. Because of this considerations, we can state the following equivalence of quadratic conditions

[formula]

Let us observe, as in [\cite=costa-ott], that the vector spaces [formula] and [formula] have the same dimension [formula], where we denote by SnI the n-th symmetric power of I.

We can induce from

[formula]

the morphisms

[formula]

[formula]

with π denoting the natural projection, and we consider the composition

[formula]

We recall a result stated in [\cite=costa-ott], that, in our situation, is the following

If we have an instanton bundle given by A, then det Q  ≠  0, i.e. Q is non-degenerate. det Q is SL(W)  ×  SL(I)  ×  SL(V)-invariant.

As we did for M, we construct the matrix associated to Q. First of all we fix the lexicographic order induced by [formula] on the elements of the basis of SnI and on the elements of the basis of Sn + 1I. We label with [formula] the elements of SnI and by [formula] the elements of Sn + 1I, where [formula] and [formula]. We decompose Q in r  ·  s blocks of dimension (2n + 2)  ×  (2n + 2k). The block Qij, is the matrix that represents the linear map

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula].

We will see later, with more details, that each block Qij is either one of the Mj blocks or the matrix of all zeros.

Considering the matrix Q we have constructed, there always exists a syzygy [formula] with

[formula]

such that Q  ·  S  =  0 and S  ≠  0.

In particular, we are going to demonstrate that the map S, represented by a [formula]-matrix of the form

[formula]

will accomplish the property we are looking for.

We are going to abuse some language now, because remembering that Q is divided by blocks, from now on we will refer to a column of blocks of Q as a column of Q and, the same way, to a row of blocks of Q as a row of Q. We observe that each column of Q is related to an element of the basis of SnI and each row is related to an element of the basis Sn + 1I. We advice to take a look at the next example to have a better understanding of all the constructions we made.

In order to prove that the map S, defined in ([\ref=syzygy]), is such that Q  ·  S = 0, we have only to look at the first k columns of Q. This means that we just need to check all possible passages from the basis elements [formula] to all the element of the basis of Sn + 1I of the form [formula]. Let us observe that we are only considering all the elements of the two basis that contain the monomial in - 11. We now have two options:

We can get every element of Sn + 1I of the type in - 11i2α, for α = 1, [formula], k, from an element of I, only multiplying in - 11iα by iα. This means that the only non-vanishing block of the row of Q corresponding to the element in - 11i2α will be a block Mα in the α-th column. Multiplying this row by S we will obtain Mα  ·  Mtα which is zero for each α, because of the quadratic relations.

We can get the elements of Sn + 1I of the type in - 11iαiβ, α  ≠  β in only two different ways: multiplying in - 11iα by iβ or multiplying in - 11iβ by iα. This means that the only non-vanishing blocks of the row of Q corresponding to the element in - 11iαiβ will be a block Mα in the β-th column and a block Mβ in the α-th column. Multiplying this row by S we will obtain Mα  ·  Mtβ  +  Mβ  ·  Mtα which is zero for each α, β, because of the quadratic relations.

Because of everything we said, the Fact [\ref=fact:1] is proved.

From Fact [\ref=fact:1] we have that the kernel of Q is not zero, so det Q = 0. This gives us a contradiction with Theorem [\ref=teo:1].

Due to all our previous work, we can state

There do not exist orthogonal instanton bundles E on [formula], for each k, n ∈ [formula].

Example.

We want to write the following simple case in order to give to the reader a better understanding of the previous proof.

It is known that for n = 1, see [\cite=okon-spin], there do not exist instanton bundles, so taking a simple case, we consider an instanton bundle E with n = 2 and k = 4. Let i1, [formula], i4 be a basis of I, v0, [formula], v5 be a basis of V and w1, [formula], w12 be a basis of W. In this particular case we have a map

[formula]

with M a 24  ×  12-matrix. Remembering what we said before, M will have the form

[formula]

In this case, we consider the map

[formula]

induced by M. Here Q is represented by a square matrix of order 120. Basing on what we have said, Q will have the following form

[formula]

where the empty entries represent 6  ×  12-matrices of zeros. We observe that in the bottom and right part of the matrix we can see, respectively, the elements of the basis of S2I related to the columns of Q and the elements of the basis of S3I related to the rows of Q.

Taking in mind the quadratic conditions expressed in ([\ref=eq:1]), it is immediate to check that

[formula]

with S  ≠  0. We can conclude that for the case k = 4 and n = 2 there do not exist orthogonal instanton bundles.

Any self-dual instanton bundle E is symplectic.

The bundle E is simple by [\cite=anc-ott]. Then

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=mainthm] implies that h0(S2E) = 0 so we have [formula] and E is symplectic.
