Star-forming regions in the intragroup medium of compact groups of galaxies

Introduction

Compact groups of galaxies are associations of three to seven galaxies, where the projected distances between them is of the order of their diameters, and where the group shows a low velocity dispersion, making compact groups an ideal place to study galaxy interaction and intergalactic star formation (e.g. [\cite=tor09b], [\cite=dem08b], [\cite=dem08a], [\cite=mdeo04]). The main goal of this work is to search for a link between the evolutionary stage of a group and the presence of young intergalactic objects which may have formed during galaxy interactions. For this, we analyze a subsample of seven compact groups (HCG 2, 7, 22, 23, 92, 100 and NGC 92) which span a wide range of evolutionary stages, from HI rich groups to strongly interacting groups, where the galaxies show tidal tail features and a deficiency in neutral HI gas. In order to analyze the evolutionary stage of each group, we used new Fabry-Perot velocity maps, GALEX/UV data and optical R-band images. The velocity fields and rotation curves help constraining the evolutionary stage of each compact group while ultraviolet light contains important information regarding the age of the young stellar population that may be present in the intragroup medium.

UV analysis

We searched for ultraviolet emitting regions in the vicinity of all seven targets, using the SExtractor software (SE, [\cite=ber96]) in the FUV, NUV and R sky-subtracted images of our compact group sample. We compare the field density of regions detected in the compact group with a control sample outside the group. HCG 92 and HCG 22 have the highest field density in this study. No excess was found in HCG 2, HCG 7, HCG 23, HCG 100 and NGC 92 ([\cite=tor09]).

Fabry-Perot analysis

In order to constrain the evolutionary stage of each compact group, we inspected the velocity field and rotation curve of each galaxy to search for interaction indicators, in a similar way to that done by [\cite=pla03] and [\cite=amr03]. In the case of NGC 92, it shows a prominent tidal tail in its velocity field. At the tip of this tail, there is a tidal dwarf galaxy candidate, having an age of about 40 Myrs ([\cite=tor09]).

Conclusions

We used multiwavelength data to study the evolutionary stages of the compact groups of galaxies HCG 2, 7, 22, 23, 92, 100 and NGC 92. New Fabry-Perot velocity fields, rotation curves and GALEX NUV/FUV images were analyzed for four and seven of these groups respectively. Groups HCG 7 and 23 are in an early stage of interaction whereas HCG 2 and 22 show limited interaction features and HCG 92, 100 and NGC 92 are in a late stage of evolution, having HI gas in the intragroup medium, galaxies with peculiar velocity fields and several young star-forming regions in the intergalactic medium.
