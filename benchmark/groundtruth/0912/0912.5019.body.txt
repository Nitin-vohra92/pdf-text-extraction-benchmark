Hyperbolic K[formula]hler-Ricci Flow

Introduction

Recently, a new flow on Riemannian manifolds is introduced by Kong and Liu([\cite=KL], [\cite=K], [\cite=DKL]):

[formula]

This is the hyperbolic version of the famous Ricci flow. They studied its short-time existence in compact case, derived evolutions of curvatures which have wave character. A dissipative flow was also considered in [\cite=DKL2]. One remarkable result is [\cite=KLX], in which the authors proved that on compact surfaces with metric depending on one space variable, the flow has a global solution if the initial velocity is large enough. So given an initial metric, the geometric surgery can be replaced by choosing suitable velocity to allow the long-time existence. However, the evolutions of Riemann curvature, Ricci curvature and the scalar curvature are very complicated which contain the first-order derivative of time that is hard to control. In this paper, I consider its complex version which is also introduced by Kong and Liu in [\cite=KL]:

[formula]

As we will see on Calabi-Yau manifolds, it can be reduced to a scalar (complex) hyperbolic Monge-Ampère equation which is much easier to handle. The flow considered here can also be regarded as the hyperbolic version of K[formula]hler-Ricci flow:

[formula]

In the past several decades, nonlinear partial differential equations played important role in differential geometry. For example, the resolutions of Calabi's conjecture [\cite=Y] and Poincaré's conjecture [\cite=CZ] [\cite=MT] [\cite=P1] [\cite=P2] [\cite=P3] are due to the methods of geometric analysis and the elliptic and parabolic type of equations are intensively studied. However, the hyperbolic equations have been ignored for a long time. For the elliptic and parabolic equations, we have the powerful tool the maximum principle which cannot be applied to hyperbolic ones. This lack of practical tool may explain the reason why the research of hyperbolic equations on manifolds are not as active as the other two types. However, Perelman [\cite=P1] [\cite=P2] [\cite=P3] introduced several powerful tools into the study of flow like the energy functional, the monotonicity formula, and the space-time geometry. In the Euclidean space, these methods are available for hyperbolic equations. So I believe we can refer to Perelman's methods to study nonlinear hyperbolic equations on manifolds.

Hyperbolic equations are important in physics especially in general relativity. The famous Einstein's equation has been studied for a long time. In fact, as illustrated in [\cite=KL], the hyperbolic version of Ricci flow is closely related to Einstein's equation. So I hope, by studying the wave character of manifolds through hyperbolic equations, we can better understand the basic structure of the universe. There is already some work on wave equations on Lorentzian manifolds which catches more interest from Physicists. Although wave equations on Riemannian manifolds are also considered, the results are few and have a more analytic style that its influence on curvature are not considered. In my opinion, analyzing wave equations on manifolds from a more geometric viewpoint so that it may give more help to understand the geometry and topology of manifolds.

Let (Mn,g,J) be a complete K[formula]hler manifold, where g is the metric depending on time and J is a fixed complex structure. The hyperbolic K[formula]hler-Ricci flow is the following evolution equation

[formula]

for a family of K[formula]hler metrics gi(t) on Mn. A natural and fundamental problem is the short-time existence and uniqueness theorem of (1.1). We will see as in the case of K[formula]hler-Ricci flow, the evolution equation of metrics can be simplified to a scalar evolution equation. In the present paper, I also derive the corresponding wave equations for various geometric quantities.

Theorem 1.1. Let (Mn,g0i(z)) be a compact Calabi-Yau manifold with g0i(z) a K[formula]hler metric. Then there exists a constant h > 0 such that the initial value problem

[formula]

has a unique smooth solution gi on M  ×  [0,h] and gi(z,t) remains K[formula]hler for any t > 0 as long as the solution exists and the initial velocity must satisfy = 0 where ω(z,0) is the K[formula]hler form of gi(z,0).

Similar to K[formula]hler-Ricci flow, I will derive the corresponding wave equations for the curvatures.

Theorem 1.2. Under the hyperbolic K[formula]hler-Ricci flow (1.1), the Riemannian curvature tensor, Ricci curvature and scalar curvature satisfy the evolution equations under a unitary coordinate

[formula]

Here [formula].

Particularly, on Calabi-Yau manifolds, the flow can be reduced to a hyperbolic Monge-Ampère equation:

[formula]

where

[formula]

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I will review briefly some basics in K[formula]hler geometry. In Section 3, I will discuss the derivation and basic facts about hyperbolic K[formula]hler-Ricci flow in detail. In Section 4, evolutions of various geometric quantities including the curvatures will be derived.

Basic K[formula]hler geometry

I state some basic facts about K[formula]hler geometry that will be used in this paper. For a thorough study of K[formula]hler geometry, [\cite=KN] [\cite=MA] [\cite=T] [\cite=ZF] are good choices. Let Mn be an n-dimensional compact K[formula]hler manifold. A Hermitian metric is given by

[formula]

Its associated K[formula]hler form is

[formula]

The K[formula]hler condition requires that ω is a closed positive global (1,1)-form.

The Riemann curvature is locally given by

[formula]

and has the symmetries

[formula]

The Ricci curvature is defined by

[formula]

and locally we have

[formula]

The associated Ricci form is

[formula]

It is a real closed (1,1)-form and represents the first Chern class. The scalar curvature is

[formula]

Given a K[formula]hler metric, there are some other important quantities. The nonzero Christoffel symbols are given by

[formula]

The volume form is

[formula]

The average scalar curvature is

[formula]

Finally I give an important lemma which is a consequence of the Hodge decomposition theorem.

Lemma 2.1(∂  -  Lemma). Let Mn be a compact K[formula]hler manifold. If a is an exact real (1,1)-form, then there exists a real-valued function ψ on Mn such that [formula]. That is,

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula].

Proof. This is a standard result in the theory of K[formula]hler manifolds, see [\cite=ZF] for example.

[formula]

Hyperbolic K[formula]hler-Ricci flow

In this section I will discuss the hyperbolic K[formula]hler-Ricci flow and its equivalent formulation as a single hyperbolic Monge-Ampère equation. For the K[formula]hler-Ricci flow theory, please see [\cite=CB]. I also suggest reader to read Hamilton's papers for more details about Ricci flow [\cite=H1] [\cite=H2]. The book [\cite=CK] is also a good choice.

Given a compact complex manifold Mn, consider the hyperbolic K[formula]hler-Ricci flow equation

[formula]

for a 1-parameter family of K[formula]hler metrics, which is obtained from the Ricci flow by dropping the factor of 2 with respect to the convention. On a Calabi-Yau manifold, the first Chern class vanishes, so = 0. Under this condition, from the ∂ - Lemma, the Ricci tensor has a potential, i.e.

[formula]

where f(z,t) is a function defined on the manifold.

Assume

[formula]

where φ(z,t) is a function on the manifold, since we have

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

So on Calabi-Yau manifolds, the hyperbolic K[formula]hler-Ricci flow equation is equivalent to the following hyperbolic (scalar) complex Monge-Ampère equation due to the maximum principle for compact manifolds:

[formula]

for some function of time c1(t) satisfying the compatibility condition

[formula]

here the Volume Vol(Mn) is under the metric gα(z,t). Further, by a time-dependent translation of φ(z,t), we can drop the factor c1(t).

Further we have

[formula]

So we can let = 0.

From the hyperbolicity and short time existence and uniqueness of our hyperbolic Monge-Ampére equation, we have proved the Theorem 1.1.

Next let us consider the normalized flow which is also studied in [\cite=KL] in the real case. Choose the normalization factor φ  =  φ(t) (Note: this has nothing to do with the φ above),

[formula]

such that

[formula]

and choose a new time parameter

[formula]

Noting that for the normalized metric i, we have

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

[formula]

where a and b are certain functions of t.

Next let us consider the following hyperbolic system

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let

[formula]

We get

[formula]

So

[formula]

thus we have

[formula]

Note that the Laplacian operator here is time-dependent so the equation is genuinely nonlinear.

Evolutions of geometric quantities

The hyperbolic K[formula]hler-Ricci flow is a hyperbolic evolution equation on the metrics. The evolution of the metrics implies nonlinear wave equations for the Riemannian curvature tensor Rik, the Ricci curvature Ri and the scalar curvature R which I will derive. I also derive the evolutions of some other quantities in this section. For the evolutions which are similar to those in this section associated to K[formula]hler-Ricci flow, please cite [\cite=CB].

Let Mn be an n-dimentional compact K[formula]hler manifold. Let us consider the hyperbolic K[formula]hler-Ricci flow on Mn,

[formula]

Proposition 4.1(Riemannian curvature tensor). In a unitary frame,

[formula]

The above formula also holds in arbitrary holomorphic coordinates if repeated indices are contracted via the metric. I.e., if RiβRαk is replaced by gγgβRiβRγk, etc.

In the K[formula]hler case, it is sometimes convenient to compute locally in holomorphic coordinates in terms of ordinary derivatives. The following lemma translates these ordinary derivatives to the covariant derivatives, [\cite=CB].

Lemma 4.2(Relation between ordinary and covariant derivatives). Let η be a closed (1,1)-form. Locally it is represented by ηα, which is Hermitian symmetric. Let ηα,γ denote the covariant derivatives and ηαγ denote [formula]. Then at the center x of normal holomorphic coordinates

[formula]

[formula]

Proof.

[formula]

In the above calculation, we use the fact that η is closed so [formula]. The second formula is the conjugate of the first.

[formula]

Proof of Proposition 4.1. Recall that

[formula]

This implies that, in a normal holomorphic coordinate system centered at any given point

[formula]

The proposition follows from the following two identities:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Recall that [formula].

[formula]

Lemma 4.3. We will need the following two basic formulas under hyperbolic K[formula]hler-Ricci flow:

[formula]

[formula]

Corollary 4.4(Ricci curvature). The Ricci curvature satisfies the following in a unitary frame:

[formula]

Proof.

[formula]

Put the evolutions of Rik and gk in, we get the result.

[formula]

Proposition 4.5(Evolution of R). The scalar curvature R evolves by

[formula]

Proof. First we have

[formula]

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

So finally

[formula]

[formula]

Next I present the evolution equations of the Christoffel symbols and the volume form.

Proposition 4.6. The christoffel symbols and the volume form evolve respectively by

[formula]

[formula]

Proof. Recall that

[formula]

thus

[formula]

So finally in normal coordinate

[formula]

The evolution of dμ follows from the quantities

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

Proposition 4.7(potential of Ricci curvature). On compact K[formula]hler manifolds, the potential f of Ricci curvature [formula] satisfies:

[formula]

Proof.

[formula]

so from the maximum principle of compact manifolds,

[formula]

[formula]

By a suitable time-dependent translation of f, we can drop the factor c(t).

Proposition 4.8. On compact K[formula]hler manifolds, the evolutions of [formula] and r are:

[formula]

[formula]

Proof. Since

[formula]

put the evolutions of R and μ in, we get the result for [formula].

Since

[formula]

and

[formula]

put the evolutions of R and μ in, we get the result for r.

[formula]

Remark. In K[formula]hler-Ricci flow, the evolutions of [formula] and r are

[formula]

and

[formula]

While in our case, all the extra terms are of first-order derivatives.

Further discussions

The flow considered here is the complex version of the hyperbolic geometric flow introduced by Kong and Liu [\cite=KL]. Kong et al [\cite=KLX] proved that on Riemann surfaces, the long time existence of hyperbolic geometric flow depends on the choice of the initial velocity. We can expect that its complex version has similar property. On Calabi-Yau manifolds, the flow can be simplified to a single complex hyperbolic Monge-Ampère equation. Note that Yau [\cite=Y] used the elliptic Monge-Ampère equation to prove the famous Calabi's conjecture and Cao [\cite=C] used its parabolic version and techniques from K[formula]hler-Ricci flow to reprove Calabi's conjecture. I hope the hyperbolic Monge-Ampère equation is also powerful to understand K[formula]hler manifolds. We can expect this new flow is helpful to study wave phenomena in the nature especially the Einstein equation. In the future, we will study several fundamental problems on the hyperbolic K[formula]hler-Ricci flow, for example, long-time existence, formation of singularities as well as physical applications.
