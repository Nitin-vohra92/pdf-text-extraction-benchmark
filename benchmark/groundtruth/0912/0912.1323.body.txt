Protons do not exert any Hilbertian gravitational repulsion

PACS 04.20 - General relativity.

1. - Recently, some authors have asserted that it would be possible to verify the existence of the Hilbertian gravitational repulsion by means of the accelerated protons of the Large Hadron Collider. We prove in this Note that such conviction is erroneous. And for a strong reason.

2. - As it is well known, the Reiß ner-Weyl-Nordström metric of the gravitational field created by an electrically charged point-mass at rest is (see e.g. our paper "Attraction and repulsion in spacetime of an electrically charged mass-point" [\cite=1], and references therein):

[formula]

where: [formula]; [formula], and 4πε is the electric charge of the gravitating point-mass m. We have: γ  (r = 0) =  +   ∞  ; γ  (r =   ∞  ) = 1; if q = 0, eq. ([\ref=eq:one]) gives the metric of Schwarzschild manifold in the standard (Hilbert, Droste, Weyl) form.

Two cases: m2 < q2, in particular m = 0; and m2  ≥  q2. For the electron and the proton m2 < q2.

We have proved in [\cite=1] that only for m2  ≥  q2 there exist spatial regions in which the gravitational force acts repulsively, both for the radial and the circular geodesics.

If m2 < q2, γ(r) is everywhere positive, with a minimum value at r = q2  /  m; [formula].

Quite generally, for the radial geodesics we get the following first integral:

[formula]

where: A < 0 for the test-particles, and A = 0 for the light-rays. We have from eq. ([\ref=eq:two]) that

[formula]

when m2 < q2, there is no gravitational repulsion, as it is easy to prove [\cite=1]. An analogous conclusion holds for the circular geodesics.

3. - Now, let us consider a distant inertial observer [formula], who sees in motion - with a given velocity - a proton which is at rest in the reference system of sect. 2.

The inequality m2 < q2 cannot become m2 > q2, or m2 = q2, by virtue of the motion, in the transformed [formula]-metric - and therefore the Lorentzian observer [formula] does not register any Hilbertian repulsion exerted by the proton.

4. - Some authors believe that in the linear approximation of GR it is possible to compute directly the gravitational field of a particle of a "cloud of dust", which is in motion with any whatever velocity and acceleration. Unfortunately, this belief is wrong, because in the linear approximation - as in the exact GR - the equations of matter motion are prescribed by the Einsteinian field equations, as we have recently emphasized in regard to the Lense-Thirring effect [\cite=2]. Now, for a "cloud of dust" of neutral particles, whose energy tensor is Tjk  =  μ  ujuk, (j,k = 0,1,2,3) - μ is the rest density of mass, and uj the four-velocity - we have [\cite=2]:

[formula]

this means that the particle motions are endlessly rectilinear and uniform. The "dust" particles do not interact, they do not create any gravitational field (in the linear approximation!). For a "cloud of dust" of electrically charged particles, whose energy tensor is again Tjk  =  μ  ujuk, if σ is the rest density of charge and fjk the electromagnetic field, one finds that [\cite=3]:

[formula]

as a consequence of Maxwell equations and Einstein linearized field equations. We see that even in this case no gravitational field is created by the particles of the "dust".

5. - As a conclusion, we wish to emphasize the conceptually interesting fact that the very small gravitational action generated by the electrostatic field of the proton (and of the electron) is sufficient to suppress any region of gravitational repulsion [\cite=4].
