Pion Oscillations

A recent note has made clear how neutrino oscillation parameters can be accessed via observing the μ in the decay π  →  μνμ if the neutrino flavor is tagged[\cite=muos]. A similar possibility, of accessing mass differences and mixing parameters occurs whenever a decay produces a recoil against a particle which is in a superposition of mass states.

An example would be [formula] where the [formula] is a flavor eigenstate of K0 or [formula].

In the two body decay [formula] the recoiling pion has an energy given by:

[formula]

Where mK is the recoiling kaon mass. Since the [formula] is not a mass eigenstate the recoiling pion will be in an entangled superposition of closely spaced energy states[\cite=cohentan].

If:

[formula]

one expects the two body πK final state to be:

[formula]

Where Γ is the pion width, t is the time and E1 and E2 are the pion energies recoiling against the K1 and K2 respectively.

The pion decay time distribution should be :

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Temporal modulation of the standard exponential decay by [formula] is avoided due to the orthogonality of the two kaon mass states, <  K2|K1  >    =  0 so a pure exponential is observed. The temporal modulation characteristic of a state in a superposition of 2 energies is not seen since the kaon portions of the wave function are correlated with the energy and are orthogonal. This orthogonality can be removed.

The other orthogonal flavor state is given by:

[formula]

One can rewrite the D decay final state in the flavor basis by rewriting |K1  >   and |K2  >   in terms of |K0  >   and [formula].

[formula]

[formula]

This gives the two body [formula] decay final state as:

[formula]

[formula]

This is the same as the entangled state written at the beginning of the article, equation [\ref=tangle], but expressed in terms of the |K0  >  , [formula] basis. Note that no |K0  >   is present at t = 0.

A measurement of a [formula] via a flavor identifying interaction, such as [formula] or decay such as K0  →  πlν projects out the coherent superposition of energy states:

[formula]

[formula]

Where N is the normalization, N = 1. So, one can prepare a pion in a superposition of closely spaced energy levels by performing a measurement that projects out this part of the wave function[\cite=feynman3]. Consequently the exponential decay is modulated by the factor [formula]

If the tag indicates a K0 and not a [formula] the time dependence is modulated by, [formula]. If the final state is not observed one sums over both the K0 and [formula] outcomes and the modulation disappears.

The oscillation frequency is given by [formula]. Which is 0.141 ×   1010 [formula] s- 1[\cite=pdg]. One can define [formula] which makes the possibility of observation good. The first few nodes of the wave-function occur at 2.23, 6.67 and 11.1 ×   10- 9 seconds.

The decay [formula] demonstrates the method to extract mixing parameters from two body decays. The frequency and lifetime are fairly convenient. On the other hand these parameters are already well measured.

Oscillations of this form can be observed in other two body decays such a [formula], [formula] and B+  →  π+K0.

An interesting application of these oscillation ideas may be to refine the measurement of ΔmD0. Decays of the form [formula] and [formula] give rise to oscillations of the π+ or the K+ when the D0 is tagged. For these decays the oscillation frequency is about 1.33 GHz. The period is 0.75 nsec, which should be easy to observe. The charged particles from two body D0 flavor tagged B+ decays would make a dotted line in the tracking system.
