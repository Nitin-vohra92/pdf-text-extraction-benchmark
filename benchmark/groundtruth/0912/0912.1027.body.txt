Introduction

In this paper, we aim at expliciting some relations between the behaviour of analytic eigenvalue branches of a spectral problem and concentration properties of its eigenfunctions. In order to illustrate this we consider a semiclassical Schrödinger operator - h2Δ + V on [formula] (in which Δ is the non-positive Euclidean Laplace operator). Viewing h as an analytic parameter, this problem enters the usual perturbation theory and the eigenvalues are organised into analytic eigenbranches Ej(h). It is then natural to address the behaviour of these eigenbranches when h goes to 0. This point of view is fundamentally different from the usual semiclassical perspective. Indeed, any analytic eigenbranch is expected to cross a typical energy window

[formula]

quantization and Semiclassical measures

In this section we will briefly recall some known facts about quantization and semiclassical measures. We will use both the classical and the semiclassical theory of pseudodifferential operators (See [\cite=Tay] [\cite=SjoDim] for background on these notions)

In the case of Schrödinger operators in [formula], the principal symbol of a (h-)pseudodifferential operator is a function in [formula] When working on a smooth compact Riemannian manifold, we will denote by S*X the quotient of [formula] by (x,ξ)  ~  (x,λξ), ~ λ > 0. The subsets of S*X are the conical subsets of [formula] The symbol of a pseudodifferential operator A is defined by testing A again fast oscillatory functions. It is then a function on [formula]. The symbol of a classical pseudodifferential operator is conically invariant and thus defines a function on S*X.

A crucial point is the ability of quantizing any reasonable function on S*X. This is done via a so-called quantization procedure. There are several possible choices, but it is useful to choose a quantization that respects positivity (see [\cite=CdV] [\cite=HMR]). Thus, for any function a on S*X there exists a pseudodifferential operator +(a) of order 0 whose principal symbol is a. If A is any other pseudodifferential operator with principal symbol a then +(a) - A is a pseudodifferential operator of order - 1. Moreover if, a is non-negative, then +(a) is also non-negative, as an operator.

In the semiclassical setting, the homogeneity condition on a is dropped and we may quantize any smooth function on T*(X) with compact support.

Using this quantization, we define the so-called semiclassical measures. We present the construction in the semiclassical setting since in the classical one we will use a non-concentration estimate rather than semiclassical measures.

We start with a Schrödinger operator on [formula] and we consider a sequence of normalized eigenfunctions uh of the equation

[formula]

such that the corresponding eigenvalues Eh converge to some non-critical energy E0. To any compactly supported function a the map a  ↦  〈+(a)uh,uh〉 defines a measure that converges weakly (up to extracting a subsequence). Any such limit is called a semiclassical measure.

Among the basic facts satisfied by any semiclassical measure, we mention only the two following properties (see [\cite=CdV] [\cite=HMR])

Any semiclassical measure is a probability measure supported on the energy surface ΣE0: = {|ξ|2 + V(x)    =    E0}.

Any semiclassical measure is invariant under the Hamiltonian flow associated with |ξ|2 + V(x) on ΣE0.

In the classical setting we can also define semiclassical measures. The main difference is that instead of a small parameter going to zero, we have to consider a sequence of eigenfunctions with eigenvalues growing to infinity and we recover a probability measure on S*X. It can be pointed out that the estimate in corollary [\ref=LowerCor] that we use in section [\ref=SecIRE] is a kind of non-concentration estimate. Indeed, such an estimate would give some information on any semiclassical measure when passing to the high energy limit. The assumptions on semiclassical measure in section [\ref=SecSchro] and on geometric control in section [\ref=SecIRE] are thus very similar in nature.

Schrödinger operators from the analytic viewpoint

In this section we consider the semiclassical Schrödinger equation in [formula]. The eigenvalue problem consists in looking for eigenfunctions uh and eigenvalues Eh such that

[formula]

in which Δ is the (non-positive) Laplace operator associated with the Euclidean metric. Let us assume that V is smooth and confining (i.e. lim |x|  →    ∞V(x) =  +   ∞  ) so that there is a complete orthonormal set of eigenfunctions and the corresponding eigenvalues grow to infinity.

This eigenvalue problem may be put into a generalized eigenvalue problem in the sense of Kato (cf [\cite=Kato]). We change notations by letting h = t thus emphasizing that we will now consider an analytic perturbation problem. An integration by parts leads to the following equivalent problem

[formula]

In which qt is the quadratic form

[formula]

defined on [formula] and n is the standard Riemannian quadratic form on L2(X). Observe that although qt is real-analytic for [formula] D is the form domain of qt only for t  ≠  0. Consequently, usual analytic perturbation theory tells us that the eigenvalues organize into real-analytic eigenbranches for t∈(0,1]. A standard question in this setting is to address the limiting behaviour of these eigenbranches when t goes down to 0.

Let Et be an eigenvalue branch of ([\ref=GenKato]), then Et converges to a limit E0 when t goes to 0. Moreover, this limit E0 is a critical value of V.

Let Et be an eigenvalue branch and ut the corresponding normalized eigenvector branch. The derivative of Et may be computed by differentiating eq. ([\ref=GenKato]) (see [\cite=Kato]), this yields

[formula]

This expression is obviously non-negative so that Et is a non-decreasing function of t. Since, for any t we have Et  ≥   min XV(x), Et has a limit E0 when t goes to 0.

The condition on concentration of semiclassical measures then enters in the following lemma.

Assume that for any semiclassical measure μ at the energy E0,

[formula]

Then, for any eigenbranch (Et,ut) such that lim Et = E0,

[formula]

Assuming this lemma, we finish the proof of the theorem. If we suppose, for a contradiction, that E0 satisfies condition (C), then using ([\ref=Deriv]), and ([\ref=LowerBound]) we get

[formula]

and this is a contradiction since Et has to converge when t goes down to 0. So condition (C) is not fulfilled and there exists a semiclassical measure at energy E0 such that

[formula]

This implies that the support of μ is contained in the level set {ξ = 0}  ⊂  ΣE0. Since dμ has to be invariant by the hamiltonian flow

[formula]

this forces E0 to be a critical value of V.

It remains to prove lemma [\ref=SCM].

As it is standard in this kind of settings (see [\cite=HHM] or [\cite=BZ]), we actually work in the reverse direction, assuming that ([\ref=LowerBound]) is not true. We may thus find a sequence tn going to 0 and corresponding eigenfunctions and eigenvalues Etn and utn, such that

[formula]

We now change notations again and let tn = h since the rest of the argument is of semiclassical nature (and, as usual in this setting h actually stands for hn). We thus have

[formula]

where ε(h) is some function going to 0 with h. The sequence uh is L2 normalized so that we may extract subsequences and find associated semiclassical measures at energy E0 since lim Eh = E0. Let dμ be one of these semiclassical measures, by definition (see remark [\ref=xi2] above)

[formula]

where the limit is understood along the subsequence defining μ. Putting ([\ref=Upper]) and ([\ref=limit]) together yields

[formula]

thus finishing the proof of the lemma.

In dimension 1 this result can be refined using that the spectrum of a one-dimensional Schrödinger operator is known to be simple. If we assume that the potential V has only non-degenerate minima, then the spectrum near the bottom of the energy is known (see [\cite=SjoDim]) and there is an infinite number of eigenvalues close to the minimum. Since the eigenvalue branches cannot cross, the non-degenerate minimum is then only possible limit.

Integrated remainder estimates

In this section, we consider a smooth compact manifold X of dimension d  ≥  2 and a real-analytic family of Riemannian metrics (gτ)τ∈[ -  1,1]. We denote by Δτ the Laplace operator associated with gτ and by Ej(τ) the associated analytic branches of eigenvalues. We will also denote by 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉τ the scalar product on L2(X,gτ). We now define the usual following counting functions :

[formula]

The following lemma expresses the variation of Et using a family of pseudodifferential operators. It also serves as a definition of the family Aτ that will be used in the rest of the paper.

There exists a real-analytic family of symbols aτ, and, for any τ0, there exists a constant C such that, for any normalized eigenbranch (En(τ),un(τ)) we have

[formula]

We will denote by Aτ    =    +(aτ).

First, by differentiating the eigenvalue equation

[formula]

we find a second-order differential operator [formula] such that

[formula]

(Observe that since the branch is normalized and using the eigenvalue equation we have that [formula]). Denote by aτ the principal symbol of [formula] and let Aτ  =  +(aτ). By definition [formula] is an analytic family of pseudodifferential operators of order - 1. In particular, Rτ is uniformly bounded from L2 into H1. This yields the bound

[formula]

We thus get

[formula]

from which the claimed bound follows since [formula] is uniformly bounded.

The main result of this section is then the following theorem (the notion of geometric control is defined in definition [\ref=defgc] in the following section).

Suppose that a0 is non-negative and that there exists ε > 0 such that the subset [formula] geometrically controls (S*X,g0), then for any fixed M, there exists τ0, E0 and K such that

[formula]

The universal remainder in Weyl's law gives that for a fixed t, [formula] as E goes to infinity. The theorem thus says that averaging with respect to the perturbation greatly improves this estimate.

The rest of the section is devoted to the proof of this theorem. The central part of the argument is actually interesting by itself and consists in proving a somewhat explicit uniform control estimate.

A uniform control estimate

We begin by recalling the notion of geometric control observing that since the velocity is constant along a geodesic, the geodesic flow of a Riemannian metric is well-defined on S*X.

We say that an open subset U of S*X (S*X,g) if for any (x,ξ)∈S*X, there exists [formula] and (x0,ξ0)∈U such that (x,ξ)    =    ΦT(x0,ξ0) where Φ.(.,.) denotes the geodesic flow of g.

It is well-known that geometric control implies a non-concentration estimate for eigenfunctions. More precisely, if U is an open subset of X such that U = S*U geometrically controls (S*X,g) then, there exists some positive c and an energy E0 such that

[formula]

for any eigenfunction un of the Laplace operator associated with g such that En  ≥  E0. (Actually the restriction on E for this estimate may be released using the principle of unique continuation for solutions of second order elliptic PDE's see remark [\ref=PUC] below)

Such a control estimate can be proved by a contradiction argument relying on known properties of semiclassical measures ([\cite=HHM], [\cite=BZ] for the scheme of such an argument). Such an approach can probably be adapted to get a control estimate that is uniform in τ. We propose here a slightly different proof that also allows us to get some uniform control on c.

Let U be an open subset of S*X that geometrically controls (S*X,g0). There exists [formula] [formula] a zeroth-order pseudodifferential operator Π on X and c > 0 such that :

The symbol π of Π is supported in U and, 0  ≤  π(x,ξ)  ≤  1 on S*X.

For any |τ|  ≤  τ0 and any u eigenfunction of Δτ with energy greater than E0 then the following non-concentration estimate holds :

[formula]

Let (x,ξ)∈S*X, the geometric control assumption implies that there exists some T( = T(x,ξ)) and (x0,ξ0)∈U such that ΦT0(x0,ξ0) = (x,ξ). Using the continuity properties of solutions of an O.D.E. both with respect to initial conditions and with respect to parameters, we can find

some τmax(x,ξ),

two conical neighbourhoods of (x,ξ) : V  =  V(x,ξ) and W  =  W(x,ξ),

a conical neighbourhood   =  (x,ξ) of (x0,ξ0)

such that V is compactly included in W and [formula] for any |τ|  ≤  τmax(x,ξ). Since S*X is compact, we can find a finite collection [formula] such that [formula] We now use the index i to denote any quantity formerly indexed by (or attached to) (xi,ξi). Denote by τ0 the minimum of all τmax(xi,ξi). We can then find a smooth partition of unity πi such that each πi is identically 1 in Vi and identically 0 outside Wi. Note that, by construction,

[formula]

We denote by π0 a smooth function which is identically 1 in [formula] and 0 outside U. Denote by Πi    =  +(πi), any by [formula] we claim that for any i > 0, and for any |τ|  ≤  τ0, the operator [formula] is smoothing. Indeed, its wave-front set is included

[formula]

which is empty by construction. In particular, each Ri,τ is bounded from H- 1(X) into L2(X). Moreover, a careful analysis of the construction of the Hadamard parametrix (as it is for instance presented in [\cite=Ber]) shows that there exists a uniform constant C such that :

[formula]

(see the appendix for a brief sketch of proof).

Since the (πi)i > 1 are a partition of unity, [formula] We thus have

[formula]

Using that u is an eigenfunction of Δτ, we have

[formula]

We use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on both terms and the following facts on the norm of the different operators :

Πi is bounded from L2(X) to itself,

Uτ(T) is an isometry from L2(X),

and ([\ref=UniformSmoothing]).

This yields :

[formula]

Using that the H- 1(X,gτ) norms are all equivalent and that [formula] when u is an eigenfunction of Δτ, we get

[formula]

for a constant C independent of τ∈[ -   τ0,τ0].

Summing all these inequalities and denoting by [formula] the maximum of the ci we obtain:

[formula]

This yields the estimate in the proposition with Π  =  Π0 and c- 1    =    2N as soon as [formula] is less than [formula]

This proposition has the following useful corollary.

Let τ0,Ẽ0 and Π be given by applying Proposition [\ref=UniformProp] to [formula] If needed, we restrict τ0 so that, for any |τ|  ≤  τ0, aτ is bounded below by [formula] on U. Observe that

[formula]

where the last inequality holds because π(x,ξ)  ≤  1 and we have chosen a positive quantization. Since the support of π is included in U we have

[formula]

which is quantized into

[formula]

with another remainder operator Rτ. Putting these two inequalities together, we obtain

[formula]

Since R is of order - 1 and the norms on H- 1 associated with (gτ)|τ|  ≤  τ0 are uniformly equivalent, there exists some uniform C such that

[formula]

Using Proposition [\ref=UniformProp], for |τ|  ≤  τ0 and E  ≥  E0, we have [formula] so that we get

[formula]

The corollary then holds with [formula] as soon as E is large enough so that [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=IREthm]

We consider normalized eigenbranches and we start from the formula for the derivative of the eigenfunctions : (in the following equation, everything except the constant C depends on τ)

[formula]

Under the assumptions of the theorem, we may use proposition [\ref=UniformProp] and its corollary. This provides us with κ > 0, τ0 and E0 such that

The rest of the argument is merely reproduced from [\cite=Hass].

Denote by [formula] A straightforward manipulation of the integral yields :

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the Lebesgue measure. We consider now E such that E - M  ≥  E0. According to ([\ref=IncreasingBranches]), any eigenbranch that crosses the energy E - M has to do it in an increasing manner. This implies that any eigenbranch for which the set Ij  : =   {t ~ | ~ Ej(τ)∈(E - M,E + M]  } is not empty satisfies Ej( - τ0)  ≤  E + M and Ej(τ0)  ≥  E - M. In particular, the sum in ([\ref=Manip]) has only a finite number of positive terms, and moreover, this number is bounded by N-  τ0(E + M) which is bounded by [formula] according to Weyl's law. Estimate ([\ref=IncreasingBranches]) also implies that Ij is an interval whose extremities we denote by τ-j and τ+j . Integrating ([\ref=IncreasingBranches]) we obtain

[formula]

as soon as E is large enough (indepently of j). This bound each term of the sum in ([\ref=Manip]), since the number of terms is also bounded explicitly using Weyl's law, we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

Examples :

A natural variation to look at is to simply take gτ  =   exp (τ)g0. In this case the control assumption is trivially satisfied so that we get a uniform integrated remainder. However, this is not a new result since looking at a fixed energy interval and dilating the volume is equivalent to fixing the volume and dilating the energy interval so that the integrated remainder is actually a regularized remainder in Weyl's law. And it is known that integrating the remainder in Weyl's law with respect to the energy yields a much better estimate than the universal remainder term.

For a more general conformal variation on a surface (d = 2) we have gτ: = (1 + τf(x))2g0, the eigenvalue problem can be put in the form

[formula]

This gives a0(x,ξ) = 2f(x). Choosing f non-negative and supported in a control region yields examples where the theorem applies.

On the contrary, the variation considered in [\cite=Hass] on a Donnelly surface doesn't satisfy the control estimate because of the cylinder of periodics orbits and of periodic geodesic in the hyperbolic wings.

Appendix : Uniform Hadamard Parametrix

The aim of this appendix is to give a (rather sketchy) justification of the uniform estimate ([\ref=UniformSmoothing]).

Let X be a smooth manifold without boundary and gτ a real-analytic family of riemannian metrics.

Denote by Uτ(s) the propagator of the half-wave equation associated with Δτ :

[formula]

and denote by kτ(s,x,y) its Schwartz kernel. This kernel kτ(s,x,y) is obtained by restricting the Schwartz kernel of [formula] to the region σ > 0 of the cotangent bundle [formula]

We start from the Hadamard parametrix construction as explained for instance in [\cite=Ber]. Concretely, for s less than some small ε and x,y such that dτ(x,y)  ≤  2ε, we make the ansatz

[formula]

in which the uk are smooth functions of x,y and Tα + k(z) are oscillatory distributions of [formula] with wave-front in {(z = 0,ζ > 0)}. The coefficients uk satisfy some transport equations from which it is straightforward that they also depend smoothly on τ. We fix a smooth cutoof function ρ: = ρ(dτ(x,y)) that cuts off in dτ(x,y)  ≤  2ε and we let kN  =  N  ×  ρ A computation then yields that kN solves the half-wave equation up to a remainder term rN(τ,s,x,y) which is Cl(N) where l(N) tends to infinity with N. Applying Duhamel's principle, we get

[formula]

Here again, a detailed analysis shows that, for s  ≤  ε and for any N, we finally have

[formula]

in which everything is smooth in τ, and RN is Cl(N). Since kN has a fixed order as a distribution of (s,x,y), applying it to a Cl function gives a Cl - β with a loss β that is independant of N.

We now fix some T, and we use the semigroup properties of U to write

[formula]

with a fixed small δ. We now plug into this expression the decomposition Uτ = KN + RN. Expanding everything gives a large sum in which each term is a composition of KN factors with RN factors. We address the regularity of each term. Each term has regularity N - pβ where p is the number of KN factors. Thus any term except the one with only KN factors may be made as regular as wanted by choosing N large enough. Moreover, everything is regular in τ.

It remains to address the term with only KN factors. Each KN is explicit and this composition is adressed using stationary phase. It is somewhat tedious in the general case because for instance of conjugate points. However it is much simpler when we have an initial and final microlocal cutoff that destroys everything in the wave-front set. Indeed a uniform non-stationary phase then applies that yields a uniform Cm bound for any m.
