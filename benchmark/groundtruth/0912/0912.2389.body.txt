Statement of results

We let Γ, ψ, and ψ(j) denote the Gamma, digamma, and polygamma functions, respectively [\cite=andrews]. We let γ =  - ψ(1) be the Euler constant. We let ζ(z) denote the Riemann zeta function, ζ(z,a) the Hurwitz zeta function, and Lis the polylogarithm function [\cite=sri]. The latter functions may be initially defined by the series

[formula]

and analytically continued through out the complex plane. In the case of integral index, as occurs in the following, we also have an expression in terms of the generalized hypergeometric function pFq [\cite=andrews]:

[formula]

We have the special case

[formula]

We then have Proposition 1. Put for integers j  ≥  0 and |z|  ≥  1, z  ≠   - 1,

[formula]

Then (a)

[formula]

and (b) (Furdui case [\cite=furdui])

[formula]

where {γk}∞k = 0 are the Stieltjes constants for the Riemann zeta function [\cite=coffey06] [\cite=coffey09] [\cite=stieltjes].

Proposition 2. Put for integers j  ≥  0 and |z|  ≥  1, z  ≠   - 1,

[formula]

Let

[formula]

where c0 =  - γ and c1  =  γ2  +  ζ(2). Then (a)

[formula]

and (b) (Furdui case [\cite=furdui])

[formula]

Proposition 3. Let {γk(a)}∞k = 0 be the Stieltjes coefficients for the Hurwitz zeta function [\cite=coffey06] [\cite=coffey09] [\cite=stieltjes]. Put for integers j  ≥  0, [formula], |z|  ≥  1, z  ≠   - 1, and Re a > 0,

[formula]

Then (a)

[formula]

(b) for j  ≥  1

[formula]

and (c)

[formula]

Proposition 4. Put for integers j  ≥  0, [formula], and |z|  ≥  1, z  ≠   - 1,

[formula]

Let

[formula]

where η0 =  - γ and η1  =  γ2 + 2γ1 [\cite=coffey09cam], [\cite=coffey04] (Appendix). Then we have (a)

[formula]

(b) for j  ≥  1

[formula]

and (c)

[formula]

Proof of Propositions

Proposition 1. We make use of the well known Laurent expansion [\cite=coffey06] [\cite=coffey09] [\cite=stieltjes]

[formula]

where γ0  =  γ. Then we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

wherein we used the series definition (1). For part (b) we use the alternating zeta function case

[formula]

together with the easily verified limit

[formula]

Alternatively, we could make use of the special case (3) in Eq. (21).

Remarks. Numerically, we have S0(1)≃ - 0.0462635927840 and γ1 ln 2≃ - 0.0504720979971.

As many series and integral representations for γk are known, (e.g. [\cite=coffey06] [\cite=coffey09]) (5) and (6) may be rewritten in a variety of ways.

By the functional equation of the zeta function, the summand of (4) could be written in terms of ζ( - 1 / n).

Proposition 2. This Proposition follows similarly, using the defining expansion (8) for the constants cj. For part (b), we again use the case (22) and the limit (23).

Remarks. Numerically, T0(1)≃0.371990830350 and - c1( ln 2) / 2≃ - 0.685561374577.

As a first approximation, one may take ck / (k + 1)!≃( - 1)k + 1 for all k  ≥  2.

The constants cj may be systematically found from polygammic constants in terms of Bell polynomials. This is because Γ' = Γψ and we may appeal to Lemma 1 of [\cite=coffeyutil].

Proposition 3. We have from [\cite=coffey06] [\cite=coffey09] [\cite=stieltjes]

[formula]

where γ0(a) =  - ψ(a), for [formula]

[formula]

Therefore, we have

[formula]

giving

[formula]

[formula]

This proves part (a). For part (b) we use relation (22). For part (c) in turn we use the limit (23).

Proposition 4. We have from (16)

[formula]

giving

[formula]

Then we find

[formula]

[formula]

For part (b) we may use (22) and for part (c) (23).

Remarks. A known recursion relation [\cite=coffey04] (Appendix) systematically gives the ηj constants in terms of the Stieltjes constants.

Numerically we have η1 ln 2≃ - 0.129997 and U00(1)≃0.0975567.

Similarly we may generalize Proposition 2 to sums containing derivatives of the Γ function,

[formula]

[formula]

Moreover, we may extend our method to sums with other analytic function summands, including for instance ζ2  +  ζ' - 2γζ and ζ2 - (ζ' / ζ)' - 2γζ. We could also similarly perform sums over derivatives of the Lerch zeta function Φ.
