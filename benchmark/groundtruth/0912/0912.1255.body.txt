Energy inequalities and dispersive estimates for wave equations with time-dependent coefficients

Model problem. We consider on [formula] the Cauchy problem for a wave equation with time-dependent coefficients and ask for the interplay between properties of coefficients (and their long-time behaviour) and large-time asymptotics of solutions (measured in terms of energies or certain norms). There is an extensive literature about results; we will sketch some of them and focus on related open problems.

Problem [\eqref=eq:CP] looks far more general than it is. Using Liouville transforms it is possible to reduce the problem to equations with constant a(t) and vanishing b(t). We will not pursue this further and merely restrict our consideration to equations with variable speed and equations with constant speed and variable dissipation.

I. Some classical results on bounded variable propagation speed.

I.(α) For the sake of completeness we start our consideration with the wave equation

[formula]

Then it is well-known that the corresponding energy

[formula]

is preserved, [formula]. Furthermore, if we replace the L2-norm by an Lq-norm, q > 2, we gain decay. This is known as Strichartz type decay estimate or dispersive estimate and goes back to classical papers of Strichartz, [\cite=Strichartz:1970], Pecher, [\cite=Pecher:1976], and von Wahl, [\cite=Wahl:1971]. It plays an essential rôle in considerations of nonlinear wave equations. In a precise formulation the result reads as

[formula]

for p∈(1,2], pq = p + q and rp  =  n(1 / p - 1 / q). As usual we denote [formula].

There exist several alternative formulations of this estimate, we want to point out two of them. First, if we replace (1 + t) by t (and thus allow the decay function to become singular in t = 0) the regularity can be sharpened to rp = (n + 1)(1 / p - 1 / q) / 2. Furthermore, this statement is then equivalent to the Strichartz' estimate

[formula]

with 2  ≤  q  ≤    ∞  , 2  ≤  r  ≤    ∞  , 1 / q + n / r = n / 2 and 1 / q + (n - 1) / (2r)  ≤  (n - 1) / 4 as pointed out in [\cite=Keel:1998].

I.(β) The simplest case of time-dependent propagation speed is a periodic coefficient,

[formula]

with [formula], 0 < a1  ≤  a(t)  ≤  a2 and [formula]. Regardless of the 'size' of the coefficient, this destroys any reasonable energy estimate as pointed out by Yagdjian, [\cite=Yagdjian:2001]. We will give a short outline of the argument. Applying a partial Fourier transform to [\eqref=eq:CPbeta] yields Hill's equation

[formula]

with spectral parameter λ = |ξ|2∈[null], pq = p + q and rp  =  n(1 / p - 1 / q) and with the auxiliary function

[formula]

Furthermore, for non-zero initial data (u1,u2)∈H1  ×  L2 the limit

[formula]

exists and is non-zero.

In particular, [\eqref=eq:scatt-est] can only be true, if tb(t) is asymptotically small. As pointed out by Hirosawa-Nakazawa, [\cite=Hirosawa:2003a], the example b(t) = μ  /  (1 + t) with μ > 1 satisfies

[formula]

for all data and, furthermore, the exponent 2 is best possible (see, e.g., [\cite=Wirth:2004c]).

III.(β) The conditions [\eqref=eq:W-cond] can be weakened in the spirit of [\cite=Hirosawa:2007] to allow faster oscillations of the coefficient. We assume that 2b(t)  =  μ(t)  +  σ(t), where μ(t) is a monotonically decreasing shape function and σ(t) carries the oscillations. Conditions are similar to II.(β) and follow [\cite=Hirosawa:2007b]. We assume Then the following statement holds true:

Assume [formula] satisfies [\eqref=eq:HW2-cond]. Then the energy of the solution to [\eqref=eq:CP-III] satisfies

[formula]

with [formula]. Furthermore, for non-zero initial data the limit

[formula]

exists and is non-zero.

Note, that σ(t) has no influence on the decay rates, only on appearing constants. σ(t) can not be seen as a small perturbation of μ(t); it might be arbitrary large.

IV. Equations with effective dissipation. Following the classification of [\cite=Wirth:2004], [\cite=Wirth:2007], we speak of effective dissipation if the lower order term 2b(t)ut changes the large time asymptotics of solutions to [\eqref=eq:CP-III] in an essential way.

IV.(α) The damped wave or telegraph equation

[formula]

was studied by Matsumura in [\cite=Matsumura:1976]. He investigated semilinear perturbations of this equation based on

The solutions to the damped wave equation [\eqref=eq:CP-damped] satisfy the a-priori estimates with [formula].

The estimates are different in structure compared to the Strichartz type estimates for the free wave equation and the related estimates discussed so far. While the used regularity is related to Sobolev embedding (and therefore hyperbolic in nature) the decay rates correspond to estimates for the heat equation (as, e.g., used by Ponce in [\cite=Ponce:1985]). This parabolic structure becomes even more apparent in the diffusion phenomenon due to Nishihara, [\cite=Nishihara:1997], [\cite=Nishihara:2003], and Yang-Milani, [\cite=Yang:2000] or the estimates of Narazaki, [\cite=Narazaki:2004].

Let u(t,x) be a solution to [\eqref=eq:CP-damped] in [formula], w(t,x) the corresponding solution to

[formula]

and v(t,x) a (suitable) free wave. Then the Lp-Lq estimate

[formula]

holds true for all 1  ≤  p  ≤  q  ≤    ∞  .

The decay rate is by one order better than expected for both [formula] and [formula] (while the regularity of the data on the right hand side is not sufficient to obtain these decay estimates--singularities are eliminated by the free wave v(t,x)).

For both statements it is essential that small frequencies determine the asymptotic behaviour of solutions. If we localise to high frequencies (or to a hyperbolic part of the phase space), we obtain exponential decay rather than the polynomial decay given in the theorems.

IV.(β) In [\cite=Wirth:2007] the author discussed variable coefficient versions of these results; we quote a slightly simplified version (c.f. [\cite=Reissig:2006] or [\cite=Wirth:2004] for this formulation). Let b(t) be subject to Then the following decay estimate holds true:

Assume [formula] satisfies [\eqref=eq:RW-cond]. Then the solution to [\eqref=eq:CP-III] satisfies the a priori estimate for 1  ≤  p  ≤  2  ≤  q  ≤    ∞   and rp  >  n(1 / p - 1 / q).

The proof of this statement is constructive in the sense that the main terms in the representation of solutions are given explicitly. The assumption tb(t)  →    ∞   guarantees that the high frequency part decays faster than the low frequency part and is essential for the parabolic type estimates. Under slightly more restrictive assumptions the diffusion phenomenon can be obtained. We refer to [\cite=Wirth:2007] for the details.

IV.(γ) We conclude the overview with some remarks concerning periodic dissipation terms. In contrast to periodic propagation speed this does not destroy Matsumura's decay estimates nor the diffusion phenomenon. The following two statements are based on [\cite=Wirth:2007d].

Assume [formula] is absolutely continuous, positive a.e. and periodic. Then the solution to [\eqref=eq:CP-III] satisfies the a priori estimate for [formula] and rp  =  n(1 / p - 1 / q).

Assume [formula] is absolutely continuous, positive a.e. and periodic. Then there exist constants α and β depending only on the coefficient function b such that the solution to [\eqref=eq:CP-III] and the corresponding solution to

[formula]

satisfies

[formula]

The constants α and β are explicit and given in [\cite=Wirth:2007d]. A similar estimate holds true if we replace the L2-norm on the right hand side by an Lq-norm, q  ≥  2, or measure spatial derivatives of the difference.

Both theorems are essentially based on the idea that small frequencies determine the asymptotic behaviour. Although the periodic coefficient leads to a variant of Hill's equation after partial Fourier transform and a change of variables, we only need to understand the neighbourhood of ξ = 0. It can be shown that away from this exceptional frequency, solutions decay exponentially, while nearby (which is inside an instability interval) the structure of the fundamental solution is known explicitly due to Floquet's theory (cf., [\cite=Magnus:1966] or [\cite=Watson:1922]).

V. Concluding remarks. We focussed on the influence of variable speed and variable dissipation. There are further results on the treatment of variable mass terms, see e.g. the treatment of Böhme-Reissig, [\cite=Bohme:2009], of scale invariant mass or [\cite=Hirosawa:2003] on interactions between variable mass and variable speed.

There is a fundamental difference between oscillations in the principle part and oscillations in lower order terms; mainly due to asymptotic relations to problems of different type. While in the first case sharp results are available (within certain symbol-like classes of coefficients), the example of effective dissipation shows an essential gap of understanding between [\cite=Wirth:2007] and [\cite=Wirth:2007d], which needs to be closed in the future.
