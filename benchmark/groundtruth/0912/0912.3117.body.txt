Introduction

In this note we study properties of

[formula]

for γ,T > 0, where BH(  ·  ) is a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H∈(0,1], i.e., a centered Gaussian process with stationary increments and variance function [formula].

Constants KT(H,γ) appear in the context of analyzing maximal inequalities for fractional Brownian motion; see e.g. [\cite=NoV99]. The aim of this paper is to give bounds for KT(H,γ). To our best knowledge the exact values of KT(H,γ) are not known.

Let

[formula]

s > 0, be the Dirichlet beta function. By En(x), n = 0,1,..., we denote the Euler polynomials; En: = 2nEn(1 / 2), n = 0,1,..., stand for Euler numbers; see [\cite=AbS], page 804. Additionally, let [formula] where N  ~  N(0,1).

The use of technique based on comparison of Gaussian processes yields the following theorem.

Let γ > 0. (i) If H < 1 / 2, then

[formula]

(ii) If H  ≥  1 / 2, then

[formula]

In the following proposition we calculate exact value of KT(1 / 2,γ) and KT(1,γ).

Let γ > 0. Then (i) [formula]; (ii) [formula].

The detailed proofs of Proposition [\ref=th.1] and Theorem [\ref=th.2] are deferred to Section [\ref=s.proofs].

As an immediate consequence of Proposition [\ref=th.1], in view of [\cite=AbS], page 805, we have

[formula]

[formula]

for n = 1,2,.... In particular [formula] and K1 / 2(1 / 2,2) is the Catalan's constant.

The comparison of the upper bound for K1(1 / 2,2n + 1) given in Theorem [\ref=th.2] with ([\ref=eq.odd]) enables us to recover the known inequality for Euler numbers

[formula]

see, e.g., [\cite=AbS], page 805. We refer to [\cite=DaG02] for other results that relate moments of functionals of Brownian motion with number theory.

Proofs

In this section we present complete proofs of Proposition [\ref=th.1] and Theorem [\ref=th.2].

We frequently use the fact that the property of self-similarity of fractional Brownian motion enables us to write

[formula]

We start with an auxiliary result which is also of independent interest.

Let [formula] be a centered Gaussian process with stationary increments and continuous and strictly increasing variance function σ2X(  ·  ), X(0) = 0 a.s. (i) If σ2X(  ·  ) is concave, then

[formula]

(ii) If σ2X(  ·  ) is convex, then

[formula]

Since the proof of (ii) is analogous to the proof of (i), we focus on the argument that justifies (i). Assume that σ2X(  ·  ) is concave. Observe that for [formula] we have

[formula]

for all t∈[0,T] and, due to concavity of σ2X(  ·  ),

[formula]

for all t > s and s,t∈[0,T]. Thus, using Slepian inequality (see, e.g., Theorem 2.1 in Adler [\cite=Adl90]),

[formula]

for all x  ≥  0. Since [formula], then we get

[formula]

Due to self-similarity of Brownian motion we have

[formula]

Finally, using that [formula], we get

[formula]

Combination of ([\ref=in.l]) with ([\ref=for.last]) completes the proof of (i).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th.2]

Following ([\ref=reduction]) we consider only the case of T = 1. Note that

[formula]

The combination of the above with Lemma [\ref=l.gen] completes the proof of (i) and the upper bound in (ii). To prove the lower bound in (ii) we use that

[formula]

This completes the proof.

[formula]

Proof of Proposition [\ref=th.1]

Ad (i). Assume that [formula]. Following ([\ref=reduction]) it suffices to analyze [formula]. Using formula 1.1.4 in [\cite=BorSal], we get

[formula]

Let

[formula]

and observe that for each n  ≥  0 and x∈(0,1]

[formula]

Additionally, for each n  ≥  0 and x > 1, we have

[formula]

where ([\ref=upper.bound.g]) follows from the fact that [formula] for each t  ≥  0. The combination of ([\ref=leb1]) with ([\ref=leb2]) implies that |fn(  ·  )| is bounded by an integrable function, and hence, by Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem, we can rewrite ([\ref=sum.1]) in the following form

[formula]

The change of the order of integration in Ik leads to

[formula]

which implies that

[formula]

This completes the proof of (i). Ad (ii). Let H = 1. Since B1(t) = dNt, where N  ~  N(0,1), then [formula]. Standard integration completes the proof. [formula]
