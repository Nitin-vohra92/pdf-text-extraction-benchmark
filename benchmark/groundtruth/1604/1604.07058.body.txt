Singular quasilinear elliptic systems with sub-, super- and homogeneous conditions

Introduction and main results

We consider the following system of quasilinear and singular elliptic equations:

[formula]

where Ω is a bounded domain in [formula] [formula] with C1,α boundary ∂Ω, α∈(0,1), λ is a positive parameter, Δp and Δq, 1 < p,q < N, are the p-Laplacian and q-Laplacian operators, respectively, that is, [formula] and [formula] We consider the system ([\ref=p]) in a singular case assuming that

[formula]

This assumption make system ([\ref=p]) be cooperative, that is, for u (resp. v) fixed the right term in the first (resp. second) equation of ([\ref=p]) is increasing in v (resp. u).

Problem ([\ref=p]) arises in several fields of application. For instance, it appears in the study of non-Newtonian fluid mechanics both for p,q > 2 (dilatants fluids) and for 1 < p,q < 2 (pseudoplastic fluids), see [\cite=A]. If p,q = 2 they are Newtonian fluids. It also arises in the study of population dynamics [\cite=P], quasiconformal mappings [\cite=Ho] and other topics in geometry [\cite=U].

Recently, singular system ([\ref=p]) with cooperative structure was mainly studied in [\cite=GHM] [\cite=GHS] [\cite=MM]. In [\cite=MM] existence and boundedness theorems for ([\ref=p]) was established by using the sub-supersolution method for systems combined with perturbation techniques. In [\cite=GHM] one gets existence, uniqueness, and regularity of a positive solution on the basis of an iterative scheme constructed through a sub-supersolution. In [\cite=GHS] an existence theorem involving sub-supersolution was obtained throught a fixed point argument in a sub-supersolution setting. The semilinear case in ([\ref=p]) (i.e. p = q = 2) was considered in [\cite=G] [\cite=HMV] [\cite=MKT] where the linearity of the principal part is essentialy used. In this context, the singular system ([\ref=p]) can be viewed as the elliptic counter-part of a class of Gierer-Meinhardt systems that models some biochemical processes (see, e.g. [\cite=MKT]). It can be also given an astrophysical meaning since it generalize to system the well-known Lane-Emden equation, where all exponents are negative (see [\cite=G]). The complementary situation for system ([\ref=p]) with respect to ([\ref=h1]) is the so-called competitive system, which has recently attracted much interest. Relevant contributions regarding this topic can be found in [\cite=GHS] [\cite=MM2] [\cite=MM3].

It is worth pointing out that the aforementioned works have examined only the subhomogeneous case Θ > 0 of singular problem ([\ref=p]) with

[formula]

The constant Θ is related to system stability ([\ref=p]) that behaves in a drastically different way, depending on the sign of Θ. For instance, for Θ < 0 system ([\ref=p]) is not stable in the sense that possible solutions cannot be obtained by iterative methods (see [\cite=CFMT]).

Unlike in the above references, the novelty of this paper is to establish the existence, regularity and nonexistence of (positive) solutions for singular problem ([\ref=p]) by processing simultaneously the three cases: 'subhomogeneous' for Θ > 0, 'homogeneous' when Θ = 0 and 'superhomogeneous' if Θ < 0. This seems to be the first work with regard to homogeneous and superhomogeneous cases for singular systems. However, we point out that even in the subhomogeneous case, our study completes those made in the above papers considering that γ > 1 in ([\ref=h']) and the exponents α2,β1 > 0 in ([\ref=h1]) are arbitrary.

Our results on existence for problem ([\ref=p]) are contained in the next theorem.

Assume ([\ref=h1]) and [formula] (resp. Θ = 0) hold with

[formula]

for some constant γ > 1. Then problem ([\ref=p]) possesses a (positive) solution (u,v) in [formula] for each (resp. large) λ > 0.

Moreover, if

[formula]

there exists β∈(0,1) such that [formula] for each (resp. large) λ > 0.

A solution of ([\ref=p]) is understood in the weak sense, that is, a pair (u,v)∈W1,p0(Ω)  ×  W1,q0(Ω), which are positive a.e. in Ω and satisfying for all (φ,ψ)∈W1,p0(Ω)  ×  W1,q0(Ω).

Our second result shows that problem ([\ref=p]) with the homogeneous condition Θ = 0 has no solutions for λ > 0 small.

Assume ([\ref=h1]) and Θ = 0 hold with

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then there exists a constant [formula] such that problem ([\ref=p]) has no solution for every [formula].

The main technical  difficulty consists in the presence  of singular terms in system ([\ref=p]) with ([\ref=h1]), expressed through (sub, super) homogeneous condition. Our approach is chiefly based on the sub-supersolution method in its version for systems [\cite=CLM]. However, this method cannot be directly implemented due to the presence of singular terms in system ([\ref=p]). So, we first disturb system ([\ref=p]) by introducing a parameter ε > 0. This gives rise to a regularized system for ([\ref=p]) depending on ε whose study is relevant for our initial problem. By applying the sub-supersolution method, we show that the regularized system has a positive solution (uε,vε) in [formula] for some β∈(0,1). It is worth noting that the choice of suitable functions with an adjustment of adequate constants is crucial in order to construct the pair of a sub- supersolution, independent of ε small. In similar fashion, this choice enable us to process simultaneously all situations regarding the sign of the constant Θ. The (positive) solution (u,v) in [formula] of ([\ref=p]) is obtained by passing to the limit as ε  →  0. This is based on a priori estimates, Fatou's Lemma and S+-property of the negative p-Laplacian. The positivity of the solution (u,v) is derived from both the positivity and the independence of the subsolution on ε. The C1,β-regularity of the obtained solution for problem ([\ref=p]) is furnished by the regularity result in [\cite=Hai] under hypothesis ([\ref=h'']). We emphasize that in the homogeneous case Θ = 0 the existence of solutions requires λ > 0 to be large whereas the nonexistence of solutions is obtained for some additional restrictions on α2, β1 provided that λ is small. A striking feature of our approach is the simplicity of the used techniques despite the serious difficulties raised by the presence of singularities in the system ([\ref=p]) under (sub-, super-) homogeneous condition.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section [\ref=S2] is devoted to the existence of solutions for the regularized system. Section [\ref=S3] established the proof of theorems [\ref=T1] and [\ref=T2].

The regularized system

Given 1 < p <  +   ∞  , the space Lp(Ω) and W1,p0(Ω) are endowed with the usual norms [formula] and [formula] respectively. We will also utilize the space [formula] for a suitable β∈(0,1). In what follows, we denote by φ1,p and φ1,q the normalized positive eigenfunctions associated with the principal eigenvalues λ1,p and λ1,q of -  Δp and -  Δq, respectively:

and

[formula]

The strong maximum principle ensures the existence of positive constants l1 and l2 such that

[formula]

For a later use we recall that there exists a constant l > 0 such that

[formula]

where d(x): = dist(x,∂Ω) (see, e.g., [\cite=GST]).

Let [formula] be a bounded domain in [formula] with C1,α boundary [formula], α∈(0,1), such that [formula] We denote by [formula] and [formula] the first eigenvalue of -  Δp on [formula] and of -  Δq on [formula], respectively. Let [formula] be the normalized positive eigenfunction of -  Δp corresponding to [formula], that isSimilarly, let [formula] be the normalized positive eigenfunction of -  Δq corresponding to [formula], that is By the definition of [formula] and the strong maximum principle, there exists a constant ρ > 0 sufficiently small such that

[formula]

Without loss of generality we assume that

[formula]

In order to regularize the singular problem ([\ref=p]), we introduce for every ε > 0 the auxiliary problem

[formula]

System ([\ref=pr]) provides approximate solutions for our initial problem ([\ref=p]). In our approach, we need to construct the sub-supersolution pairs of ([\ref=pr]).

Let C > 1 a real constant and let [formula] be the functions definded as follows:

[formula]

with constants δ, θ1 and θ2 satisfying

[formula]

and

[formula]

where k > 0 is a constant to be chosen later on. Functions ξ1and ξ2 satisfying

with constants c2  ≥  c1 > 0 and [formula] (see [\cite=GST]).

Set

and

[formula]

where γ > 1 is a real constant and σ is defined by

[formula]

We have [formula] in [formula]. Indeed, from ([\ref=39]), ([\ref=40]), ([\ref=12]), ([\ref=13]), ([\ref=31]), ([\ref=50]), ([\ref=51]) and ([\ref=32]), we haveandprovided that C > 1 is large enough. Then the monotonicity of the operators -  Δp and -  Δq leads to the conclusion.

We state the following result regarding the regularized system.

Assume ([\ref=h1]) holds. Then if [formula] (resp. Θ = 0) there exists ε0 > 0 such that for all ε∈(0,ε0), system ([\ref=pr]) has a (positive) solution [formula] β∈(0,1), for each λ > 0 (resp. large λ > 0). In addition it hold

[formula]

We shall verify that [formula] in ([\ref=14]) is a subsolution for problem ([\ref=pr]) for all ε∈(0,ε0). A direct computation gives

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

For a fixed δ > 0 sufficiently small we denote Since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

We recall that there exists a constant μ  =  μ(δ) > 0 such that

[formula]

Fix We first deal with the nonhomogeneous condition [formula] Let us choose the constant k > 0 as follows:

[formula]

This is possible in view of ([\ref=c0]). By ([\ref=41]), ([\ref=c0]) and ([\ref=400]) observe thatThen, since γ > 1, using ([\ref=3]), ([\ref=13]), ([\ref=41]) and ([\ref=9]), for all ε∈(0,ε0) and for each λ > 0, it follows that

[formula]

provided C > 1 is sufficiently large. Proceeding in the same way, for each λ > 0 and for all ε∈(0,ε0), we see from ([\ref=3]), ([\ref=13]), ([\ref=41]) and ([\ref=9]) that

[formula]

provided C > 1 is sufficiently large.

Now, we examine the case Θ = 0. By ([\ref=3]), ([\ref=13]) and ([\ref=9]) and recalling that σ = 0

[formula]

provided λ > 0 is sufficiently large. Similarly,

[formula]

provided λ > 0 is sufficiently large.

Gathering ([\ref=10]), ([\ref=11]), ([\ref=7]), ([\ref=7*]), ([\ref=4]), ([\ref=4*]), ([\ref=5]) and ([\ref=5*]) together and bearing in mind that γ > 1 yieldsproving that (,) in ([\ref=14]) is a subsolution pair for problem ([\ref=pr]) for all ε∈(0,ε0).

Next, we construct a supersolution for problem ([\ref=pr]). Taking into account ([\ref=h1]), ([\ref=40]),([\ref=12]), ([\ref=3]), ([\ref=600]) and ([\ref=13]), for all ε∈(0,ε0), we derive that in [formula] one hasprovided C > 0 is sufficiently large. Similarly, we haveThis shows that [formula] is a supersolution pair for problem ([\ref=pr]) for all ε∈(0,ε0).

Then we may apply the general theory of sub-supersolutions for systems of quasilinear equations (see [\cite=CLM]), which implies the existence of a solution [formula] of problem ([\ref=pr]), for all ε∈(0,ε0). Moreover, applying the regularity theory (see [\cite=L]), we infer that [formula] for a suitable β∈(0,1) and for all ε∈(0,ε0). This completes the proof.

A careful inspection of the proof of Theorem [\ref=T3] shows that the constants C > 1 when [formula] and λ > 0 for Θ = 0 can be precisely estimated.

Proof of the main results

This section is devoted to the proof of Theorems [\ref=T1] and [\ref=T2].

The proof relies on Theorem [\ref=T3]. Set [formula] with any positive integer n > 1 / ε0. From Theorem [\ref=T3] with [formula], we know that there exist [formula] and [formula] such that

[formula]

for all (φ,ψ)∈W1,p0(Ω)  ×  W1,q0(Ω). By taking φ = un in ([\ref=122]) and since α1 < 0, we get

[formula]

If - 1  ≤  α1 < 0 (see ([\ref=h'])), on the basis of ([\ref=123]) with [formula] and ([\ref=h''']), it follows directly that {un} is bounded in [formula]. It remains to argue when the exponent α1 verifies [formula] (see ( [\cite=LM])). By virtue of the strong maximum principle for the negative Dirichlet p-Laplacian (see [\cite=V]),we can find an eigenfunction φ1 corresponding to the first eigenvalue of ( - Δ,H10(Ω)) such that φ1,p  ≥  φ1 in [formula]. Then, on account of ([\ref=123]) with [formula]([\ref=h''']), ([\ref=40]) and ([\ref=14]) it holds the estimate where [formula]. Thanks to [\cite=LM], we know that φγ(α1 + 1)1∈L1(Ω). Then the above inequality yields {un} is bounded in [formula]. In quite similar way, we show that the sequence {vn} is bounded in [formula]. We are thus allowed to extract subsequences (still denoted by {un} and {vn} ) such that

[formula]

The convergence in ([\ref=30]) combined with Rellich embedding theorem and ([\ref=h''']) enable us to get

[formula]

Inserting (φ,ψ) = (un - u,vn - v) in ([\ref=122]) yields We claim thatIndeed, from ([\ref=320]) we haveThen, using again the Lemma in [\cite=LM], the function belongs to L1(Ω). This way,

[formula]

Using ([\ref=30]), ([\ref=300]) and applying Fatou's lemma, it follows thatSimilarly, we prove that [formula] Then the S+-property of -  Δp and -  Δq on W1,p0(Ω) and W1,q0(Ω), respectively, guarantees that Hence we may pass to the limit in ([\ref=122]) to conclude that (u,v) is a solution of problem ([\ref=p]). On account of ([\ref=320]), the weak solution (u,v) of ([\ref=p]) is positive.

Furthermore, using ([\ref=320]), ([\ref=40]), ([\ref=14]) and ([\ref=6]), we getandwhere C1 and C2 are constants given byThen ([\ref=h'']) enable us to apply the regularity theory (see [\cite=Hai]) to infer that [formula] for some β∈(0,1). This complete the proof.

Arguing by contradiction and suppose that (u,v) is a positive solution of problem ([\ref=p]). Multiplying the first and the second equation in ([\ref=p]) by u and v, respectively, it follows from ([\ref=c]) and Young inequality that

and

[formula]

Adding ([\ref=55]) with ([\ref=56]), according to ([\ref=c2]), this is equivalent to

[formula]

Since Θ = 0, observe from ([\ref=c2]) that

[formula]

Recalling that the eigenvalues λ1,p and λ1,q introduced in ([\ref=1]) and ([\ref=2]) can be characterized by the minimum of Rayleigh quotient

[formula]

Then gathering ([\ref=60]), ([\ref=61]) and ([\ref=62]) together yieldswhich is a contradiction for Thus, problem ([\ref=p]) has no solution for [formula] which ends the proof of Theorem [\ref=T2].
