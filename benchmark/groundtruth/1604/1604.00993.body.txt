Abstract. In this paper we explore inequalities between symmetric homogeneous polynomials of degree four of three real variables and three nonnegative real variables. The main theorems describe the cases in which the smallest possible coefficient is not expressed by the other coefficients. The problem is resolved by introducing a parametric representation.

Key words: symmetric, homogeneous, polynomial, inequalities, degree three and four.

Mathematics Subject Classification: 26D05.

In recent years, inequalities between symmetric homogeneous polynomials are studied in several articles [\cite=Ando]-[\cite=Zhou]. We will explore the inequality

[formula]

[formula]

where a, b, c are real constants, and x, y, z are real variables or nonnegative real variables. The proof of the main theorem 3 in this paper is structured by setting of auxiliary functions (2), lemma 4 and the representation (7). For brevity we will denote the main symmetric homogeneous polynomials of degree four

[formula]

w1 = xyz(x + y + z) and the inequality is written in the form

[formula]

In Section I we find b   min such that the inequality f(x,y,z) = w4 + aw3 + bw2 + cw1  ≥  0 holds for arbitrary x,y,z∈R if and only if when b  ≥  b   min.

In the particular case [formula] the upper inequality holds if and only if when [formula] (Theorem 2).

When c  ≤   - a2 - 2a (Theorem 1)  b   min =  - 2a - c - 1. This statement follows also from [\cite=Cirtoaje], Theorem 2.1.

When c >  - a2 - 2a the situation radically changes. In some particular cases b   min could be expressed in radicals, for example when a = 2 and c = 4 >  - a2 - 2a we find [formula]. When b = b   min the equality holds when x = y = 1 and [formula] and of course for any permutation. When a =  - 1 and c = 2 >  - a2 - 2a we find [formula]. The equality holds when x = y = 1 and [formula].

We overcome this problem by introducing the rational parameterization [\eqref=two] (see Theorem 3).

We note that this parametrization is in line with [\cite=Cirtoaje2], Theorem 2.2: 'The inequality f(x,y,z) = w4 + aw3 + bw2 + cw1  ≥  0 holds if and only if when f(x,1,1)  ≥  0 for every real x.'

In Section II we will explore the inequality

[formula]

where x, y, z are nonnegative real variables. First we find the necessarily conditions for the coefficient b (Lemma 5) and then we search cmin such that the previous inequality holds if and only if when c  ≥  cmin. We note that w1 is the smallest symmetric polynomial 2w4  ≥  w3  ≥  2w2  ≥  2w1  ≥  0.

When a  ≥   - 1 ⇒   b  ≥   - 2(a + 1) and cmin =  - 2a - b - 1. This statement follows also from [\cite=Cirtoaje], Theorem 2.6. According to this theorem the inequality f(x,y,z)  ≥  0 holds also when a <  - 1, but when c >  - 2a - b - 1 the condition b  ≥  a2 - 1 is not necessary. When a <  - 1 and b < a2 - 1, only in some particular cases [formula] could be expressed in radicals. For example, when a =  - 4 and b = 14 (- 2(a + 1) < b < a2 - 1) [formula] When c = cmin the equality holds when x = y = 1 and [formula] and of course for any permutation. Another example, when a =  - 6, b = 31 [formula] [formula]. The equality holds when x = y = 1 and [formula]

We again solve the problem by using the rational parametrization [\eqref=two] (see Theorem 7).

We note that this do not contradict to [\cite=Ando2] and [\cite=Cirtoaje3], Theorem 2.1: 'The inequality f(x,y,z) = w4 + aw3 + bw2 + cw1  ≥  0 holds if and only if when f(x,1,0)  ≥  0 and f(x,1,1)  ≥  0 for every x  ≥  0.'

Remark. All identities are verified via the Maplesoft platform.

Section I. We will explore the inequality

[formula]

where a, b, c are real constants and x, y, z are real variables.

Theorem 1. One necessary condition to be true the inequality [\eqref=one] is b  ≥   - 2a - c - 1. When c  ≤   - a2 - 2a this condition is also a sufficient condition (This statement follows also from [\cite=Cirtoaje], Theorem 2.1).

Theorem 2. When [formula] the inequality [\eqref=one] holds if and only if when [formula]

When [formula] and c  ≥   - a2 - 2a we introduce the rational functions:

[formula]

[formula]

and we will explore the different cases about the parameter a when the rational function c(t) always takes values in the interval

[formula]

:

[formula]

Theorem 3. When [formula] and c  ≥   - a2 - 2a in the following four cases: (3.1.)    [formula] and t∈[null]; (3.3.)      a > 4 and [formula] the inequality f(x,y,z) = w4 + aw3 + bw2 + cw1  ≥  0 holds if and only if when b  ≥  b(t). When b  =  b(t) we have f(t,1,1) = f(1,t,1) = f(1,1,t) = 0.

For the proof of this theorem 3 and theorem 7 below we will use the following known statement.

Lemma 4. For arbitrary real numbers X, Y and Z the inequality

[formula]

holds if and only if when - 1  ≤  k  ≤  2.

Section II. We will explore the inequality

[formula]

where a, b, c are real constants and x, y, z are nonnegative real variables.

Lemma 5. To be true the inequality [\eqref=five] it is necessary:

Theorem 6. ([\cite=Cirtoaje], Theorem 2.6). When a  ≥   - 1 the inequality [\eqref=five] holds if and only if when b  ≥   - 2(a + 1) and c  ≥   - 2a - b - 1.

Remark. According to ([\cite=Cirtoaje], Theorem 2.6) the inequality [\eqref=five] is true also when a <  - 1, b  ≥  a2 - 1 and c  ≥   - 2a - b - 1, but when c >  - 2a - b - 1 the condition b  ≥  a2 - 1 is not necessary.

When a <  - 1 and b  ≤  a2 - 1 we will describe the different cases about the parameter a again with the rational function b(t) and c(t), defined by [\eqref=two].

When - 2  ≤  a  <   - 1 and t∈[0;  -  a  -  1] the rational function b(t) is monotone increasing and takes values in the intervala

[formula]

, i.e. [formula], and when t∈[ -  a  -  1  ;t2] the function b(t) is monotone decreasing and takes values in the interval

[formula]

, i.e. [formula].

Theorem 7. In the three cases: (7.1.)     - 2  ≤  a <  - 1 and t∈[0  ;  -  a  -  1] ; (7.2.)    - 4 < a <  - 2 and [formula]; (7.3.)      a  ≤   - 4 and t∈[ -  a  -  1  ;t2] the inequality f(x,y,z) = w4 + aw3 + b(t)w2 + cw1  ≥  0 holds if and only if when c  ≥  c(t). When c  =  c(t) we have f(t,1,1) = f(1,t,1) = f(1,1,t) = 0.

Section I (real variables)

Remark. In the proves we have in mind that the following basic symmetric homogeneous polinomial inequalites of degree four of three real variables are true:

[formula]

Proof of Theorem 1.

The necessity follows from 0  ≤  f(1,1,1) = 3 + 6a + 3b + 3c, i.e. b  ≥   - 2a - c - 1.

The sufficiency follows from the relation

[formula]

where u = (x - y)(x + y + az) and v = (x - z)(x + z + ay).

When c  ≤   - a2 - 2a  ⇒    b  ≥   - 2a - c - 1  ≥  a2 - 1 and w4 + aw3 + bw2 + cw1  =

[formula]

Remark. When a =  - 1, c =  - a2 - 2a = 1 and b =  - 2a - c - 1 = 0 we obtain the famous inequality of I. Schur [\cite=Schur],  w4 + w1  ≥  w3.

Proof Theorem 2.

When [formula] and [formula]  ⇒    [formula] the basic inequality [\eqref=six] is [formula] and the statement follows from Theorem 1.

From 0  ≤  f(2,2, - 1) = 24b - 12c + 27  ⇒    [formula].

When [formula]  and   [formula] we have

[formula]

Before the proof of Theorem 3 we will prove Lemma 4.

Proof of Lemma 4.

From g(1,1,1) = 3 + 3k  ≥  0 and from g(1, - 1,0) = 2 - k  ≥  0 it follows that - 1  ≤  k  ≤  2. And [formula].

Proof of Theorem 3. Necessity.

[formula]

From [formula] follows that b  ≥  b(t).

Sufficiency follows from the identity:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

When t = 1 we obtain that p =  - 1, q = 1 and the indentity do not depend on k because XY + YZ + ZX = 0.

Having in mind Lemma 4 it remains to check that - 1  ≤  k  ≤  2 for the different cases. (3.1) When [formula] and t∈[null] ⇒   2t + 1 > 0, t - 1  ≤   - a - 2 < 0, t + a + 1 < 0   ⇒

[formula]

When a =  - 2 and [formula]  ⇒    k = 2t∈( - 1;2). Remark. The case t = 1 is possible only if a =  - 2  ⇒    b(1) = 3, c(1) = 0  and

[formula]

(3.3) When a > 4 and [formula]. When [formula]  ⇒    t  ≤  t1 < 1,   2t + 1 > 0,   t + a + 1 < 0, i.e.

[formula]

When t∈[ -  a  -  1  ;t2]  ⇒    t > 1,   t + a + 1  ≥  0   and again

[formula]

Remark. The function b(t) is not monotone, e.g. when a = 2, t =  - 1  ⇒    c( - 1) = 8, b( - 1) = 3, k = 0, p = q = 1   and

[formula]

while when t =  - 3  ⇒    c( - 3) =  - 8,   b( - 3) = 3 = b( - 1),   [formula],   [formula]   and as   k =  - 1   from [\eqref=seven]

[formula]

[formula]

Analogously when   [formula],   t =  - 1   and   t =  - 4   we obtain the inequalities:

[formula]

Remark. The parameter t generates different optimal inequalities. 1. When t =  - a - 1  we have

[formula]

[formula]

2. When   t = t1   or   t = t2   and   [formula]; (7.2) - 4  <  a  <   - 2   and   [formula]   and   (7.3) a  ≤   - 4   and   t∈[ -  a  -  1;t2] contain itself in (3.4) a <  - 2   and   [formula].
