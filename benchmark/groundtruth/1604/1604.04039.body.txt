Improving bounds on the diameter of a polyhedron in high dimensions

Introduction

The diameter of a polyhedron P is defined as the smallest number k such that any two vertices of P are joined by at most k edges of P. An outstanding open problem in polyhedral combinatorics is to determine the behavior of Δ(d,n), where Δ(d,n) is the maximum possible diameter of a d-dimensional polyhedron with n facets.

The studies on Δ(d,n) are closely related to the complexity of the simplex method. Specifically, Δ(d,n) is a lower bound on the number of pivots required, at worst, by the simplex method to solve a linear program with d variables and n constraints. In this context, a major question is whether there is a polynomial bound on Δ(d,n).

Background

In 1970, Larman [\cite=La70] proved Δb(d,n)  ≤  2d - 3n, where Δb(d,n) denotes the value of Δ(d,n) for bounded polyhedra, i.e., polytopes. Larman bound is exponential in d, but linear in n in fixed dimension. Barnette [\cite=Ba74] improved Larman bound to 2d - 3(2n / 3). Recently, Labbé et al. [\cite=LaMaSa15] showed this bound also applies to Δ(d,n).

In 1992, Kalai and Kleitman [\cite=KaKl92] proved Δ(d,n)  ≤  nlog 2(d) + 2, the first sub-exponential bound. Kalai [\cite=Ka97] refined this to nlog 2(d) + 1 in a general setting. Eisenbrand et al. [\cite=Ei10] showed that nlog 2(d) + 1 and 2d - 1n, a slightly weak Larman bound, hold in a more general setting, base abstraction.

In 2014, Todd [\cite=To14] revisited the analysis of Kalai and Kleitman [\cite=KaKl92] to prove an improved bound (n - d)log 2(d). As in [\cite=Ei10], Gallagher and Kim [\cite=GaKi14] showed that an analogous bound (n - d)log 2(d) + 1 holds for the diameters of subset partition graphs.

Todd bound (n - d)log 2(d) is tight for d  ≤  2. Furthermore, it fits better with the well-known Hirsch conjecture, i.e., a bound n - d [\cite=Da63]. One may consider to reduce the exponent log 2(d) of Todd bound to approach Hirsch bound, however, this immediately contradicts to the tightness for d  ≤  2. For this, Sukegawa and Kitahara [\cite=SuKi15] considered to restrict the dimension, and showed that Δ(d,n)  ≤  (n - d)log 2(d - 1) for d  ≥  3. For d = 3, this bound coincides with Hirsch bound and is tight. These observations may suggest that Kalai-Kleitman bound can be improved further in high dimensions.

Main results

In this paper, motivated by [\cite=To14] [\cite=SuKi15], we introduce a proof method to improve Kalai-Kleitman bound in high dimensions. By this proof method, we improve the currently best bounds as follows.

For d  ≥  7, we have Δ(d,n)  ≤  (n - d)log 2(d) - 1. In addition, for d  ≥  37, we have Δ(d,n)  ≤  (n - d)log 2(d) - 2 .

These two bounds improve Todd bound by, respectively, one and two orders of magnitude, although they are not valid in low dimensions. Also, we have

For d  ≥  1, we have Δ(d,n)  ≤  (n - d)log 2(d) - 3 + O(1 / d).

This general bound improves Todd bound only for d  ≥  7, and by three orders of magnitude for sufficiently large d, i.e., in high dimensions.

The key is a recursive inequality due to [\cite=KaKl92], which we call Kalai-Kleitman inequality. It provides a proof of bounds on Δ(d,n) by induction on d and n, as used in [\cite=KaKl92] [\cite=To14] [\cite=SuKi15]. Different from [\cite=KaKl92] [\cite=To14] [\cite=SuKi15], we device a computer-assisted method which utilizes Larman bound [\cite=La70] [\cite=LaMaSa15] to tighten the inductive step. With more computational resources and better bounds in low dimensions, this computer-assisted method can be strengthened.

Preliminaries

In this section, we first give a formal definition of the diameter of a polyhedron. We then introduce Kalai-Kleitman inequality to give the idea of the proof method.

Terminologies

We say that [formula] is a polyhedron if it is an intersection of a finite number of closed halfspaces. In this paper, polyhedra can be unbounded. The dimension dim (P) of a polyhedron P is that of its affine hull.

For a given polyhedron P, an inequality [formula] is said to be valid for P if it is satisfied by any point x∈P. We say that F is a face of P if there is a valid inequality [formula] for P which satisfies

[formula]

Since faces are again polyhedra, the dimension of a face is defined as before. In particular, 0-, 1-, and ( dim (P) - 1)-dimensional faces are, respectively, referred to as vertex, edge, and facet.

The 1-skeleton of a polyhedron P is a graph G = (V,E) which represents the vertex-vertex adjacency defined by the edges of P. More precisely, V is a set of vertices of P, and E is a set defined in such a way that for u,v∈V, {u,v}∈E if and only if

[formula]

forms an edge of P. The diameter δ(P) of P is that of its 1-skeleton. Formally, if we let ρP(u,v) denote the shortest path length from u to v, i.e., the number of edges required for joining u and v, in G, then

[formula]

In this paper, we are interested in bounding δ(P) from above by a function of its dimension d =  dim (P) and number n of facets. In other words, if we let

[formula]

the goal is to find a function f(d,n) such that Δ(d,n)  ≤  f(d,n) holds for an appropriate region.

The well-known conjecture about Δ(d,n) is a linear bound n - d posed by Hirsch in 1957. Hirsch bound holds for d  ≤  3 [\cite=Kl64] [\cite=Kl65] [\cite=Kl66], 0-1 polyhedra [\cite=Na89], and specific pairs (d,n) [\cite=BrDeHuSc13]. In 1967, Klee and Walkup [\cite=KlWa67] disproved it for unbounded polyhedra. Only recently, in 2010, Santos [\cite=Sa12] disproved it for bounded polyhedra, which refined in Matschke et al. [\cite=MaSaWe12]. However, the currently best lower bound violates Hirsch bound n - d only by a constant. For the details, see [\cite=Sa13].

Kleinschmidt and Onn [\cite=KlOn92] proved a diameter bound kd on a lattice polyhedra whose vertices are in [formula]. Recently, their result was improved from above and below in [\cite=DeMi15] [\cite=DeMaOn15]. Another important parameter is the maximum absolute value ΔA of subdeterminants of a matrix A defining a polyhedron, see, e.g., [\cite=DyFr94] [\cite=Bo14], and also [\cite=DaHa14] [\cite=MiSuDe14] [\cite=MiSuDe15] for the discussion in the context of the simplex method.

Kalai-Kleitman inequality

The key of the proof method is the following recursive inequality established by Kalai and Kleitman [\cite=KaKl92] in 1992.

For ⌊n / 2⌋  ≥  d  ≥  2,

[formula]

See, e.g., Kalai and Kleitman [\cite=KaKl92] or Todd [\cite=To14].

We observe that Kalai-Kleitman inequality provides a proof of an upper bound on Δ(d,n) by induction on d and n. Let f(d,n) denote the target bound. If we could show the inductive step,

[formula]

then, Kalai-Kleitman inequality, with the inductive hypothesis, Δ(,n̄)  ≤  f(,n̄) for   ≤  d and n̄  <  n, implies

[formula]

The point is how to derive (). Todd [\cite=To14] showed that () holds for the function (n - d)log 2(d) when d  ≥  4 and n - d  ≥  8.

Proof method

In this section, we introduce a target bound which has two parameters controlling the quality of the bound. We then show that () holds for any combination of the parameters, while substantially increasing the number of pairs (d,n) checked in the base step. We devise and apply a computer-assisted method to solve this task.

Target bound

Introducing two parameters α,β, we modify the exponent log 2(d) of Todd bound into [formula]. Namely, we focus on a bound

[formula]

For convenience, we assume that α  ≥  1 is an integer and β  ≥  0. Using the fact that [formula] for x  ≥  0, we have

[formula]

Therefore, it improves Todd bound by log 2(α) orders of magnitude for a sufficiently large d, i.e., in high dimensions.

Inductive step

The next lemma shows that () holds for fα,β(d,n) with any combinations of α and β when d and n - d are both sufficiently large. Our proof extends that of Todd [\cite=To14] for (n - d)log 2(d) where (α,β) = (1,0).

Suppose that α  ≥  1 is an integer and β  ≥  0. Then, there exists an integer d(α,β) such that d  ≥  d(α,β) and n  ≥  d + 22α + 1 imply ().

Since blog 2(a) = alog 2(b) holds for any a,b > 0, we have

[formula]

for the second term in the left hand side of (). Then, the whole of the left hand side of () is bounded from above by

[formula]

where the last inequality follows because the assumption n  ≥  d  +  22α + 1 implies log 2(n - d)  ≥  2α + 1, and we have

[formula]

for any d  ≥  2, α  ≥  1, and β  ≥  0.

As shown in Claim [\ref=clm:1] below, there is an integer d(α,β) such that the square bracket of () is bounded from above by 1 - 2 / fα,β(d,n) for d  ≥  d(α,β). This completes the proof of the lemma.

Bellow, we prove Claim [\ref=clm:1].

For given α and β, it is not that difficult to compute the largest root x* of the polynomial [formula]. We can use d(α,β): = α(x*  -  β) in the above claim.

Base step: computer-assisted method

In Lemma [\ref=lem:validInductive], we assumed d  ≥  d(α,β) and n  ≥  d + 22α + 1. Therefore, we need to check if Δ(d,n)  ≤  f(d,n) for pairs (d,n) satisfying

d  <  d(α,β), or

n  <  d + 22α + 1.

as the base step. In order to solve this task, we devise a computer-assisted method which is based on several fundamental facts from polyhedral theory.

Basic strategy

The computer-assisted method is based on

Δ(d,n)  ≤  Δ(d - 1,n - 1) for n  <  2d,

Δ(d,n)  ≤  K(d,n), an implicit bound recursively calculated from Kalai-Kleitman inequality, i.e., K(d,n) = K(d - 1,n - 1) + 2K(d,⌊n / 2⌋) + 2,

Δ(d,n)  ≤  L(d,n) = 2d - 3n, Larman bound shown in [\cite=LaMaSa15].

F1, F2, and F3 are correct.

For completeness, we give the proofs of F1 and F2 below. The proof of F1 can also be found in Todd [\cite=To14]. Also, for F3, see [\cite=LaMaSa15].

We say that a d-dimensional polyhedron is simple if its each vertex lies in exactly d facets. It is known that Δ(d,n) is attained by a simple polyhedron, see, e.g., [\cite=KK87] [\cite=Zi]. Now, assume that n  <  2d. Let P be a simple d-dimensional polyhedron with n facets whose diameter attains Δ(d,n). In this case, any two vertices of P shares a common facet, say, F. Since the diameter of F is bounded from above by Δ(d - 1,n - 1), we have Δ(d,n)  ≤  Δ(d - 1,n - 1). Hence, F1 is correct.

Formally, the bound K(d,n) in F2 is defined by

[formula]

As trivial cases, we set K(1,1) = 0 and K(1,n) = 1 for any n. The correctness of F1 and the validity of Kalai-Kleitman inequality for ⌊n / 2⌋  ≥  d  ≥  2 ensures Δ(d,n)  ≤  K(d,n) in general.

Combined with C2: n  <  d + 22α + 1, F1 makes the base step finite with respect to d. On the other hand, F3, i.e., Larman bound, makes the base step finite with respect to n from its linearity in fixed dimension. Finally, F2, i.e., implicit Kalai-Kleitman bound, enables us to estimate Δ(d,n) for relatively large d.

The computer-assisted method

For given parameters, the computer-assisted method returns either Success or Failure. Success means that the base step holds, while Failure means that we failed to ensure that the base step holds, although it can be correct.

In Table [\ref=tbl:exBC], we show the image of the pairs (d,n) explored during the execution of BaseCaseCheck(α,β,γ).

In Step 4, nL(d), denoted by L in Table [\ref=tbl:exBC], is an integer n' such that n  ≥  n' implies fα,β(d,n)  ≥  L(d,n). Since Larman bound L(d,n) = 2d - 3n is linear in n in fixed dimension, such an nL(d) exists if α and β satisfy 1 / α  +  β  ≥  1, d / α  +  β  ≥  2 for d = 2,3, and d / α  +  β  >  2 for d  ≥  4. By the definition of nL(d), we can omit the cases with n  ≥  nL(d) because Δ(d,n)  ≤  L(d,n)  ≤  fα,β(d,n) for n  ≥  nL(d).

BaseCaseCheck(α,β,γ) terminates with either Success or Failure in a finite number of iterations. Also, if it returns Success, the base step holds for given parameters.

The number of steps required for Step 3 and 4 is finite. Also, since d(α,β) is finite as confirmed in Claim [\ref=clm:1], after a finite number of steps, we always enter Step 2 when entering Step 1. Hence, we finally have d  ≥  22α + 1, which implies the finiteness of the method.

Recall that in the base step, we need to confirm Δ(d,n)  ≤  fα,β(d,n) for all the pairs (d,n) satisfying

[formula]

where the cases with n  ≤  d are omitted as Δ(d,n) = 0 for n  ≤  d. On the other hand, BaseCaseCheck(α,β,γ) confirms it for the pairs (d,n) satisfying

[formula]

For n < 2d, from F1, the inductive hypothesis, i.e., the fact that the statement holds for d - 1, and the definition of fα,β(d,n), we obtain

[formula]

Combining this with the definition of nL(d), we observe that () covers (). Also, for d  ≥  22α + 1, we have 2d  ≥  d + 22α + 1, which implies that there is no n satisfying (). Then, using () again for cases with n < 2d, we observe that () covers (). Therefore, the latter claim also holds.

We refer to the very recent result by Gallagher and Kim. In [\cite=GaKi16], they use a computer-assisted method which is similar to ours for proving bounds, which are analogous to that of Sukegawa and Kitahara [\cite=SuKi15], on polyhedra, polytopes, and normal simplicial complexes. It however should be noted that their main results are on its proofs for tail-polynomial-bounds, i.e., they showed that the diameter is bounded from above by a polynomial function of n when n is sufficiently large.

Numerical examples

We start with small examples with α = 2 to see how the proof method works. Then, we show the overall results including the bounds in Theorem [\ref=thm1] and [\ref=thm2].

Example with α = 2

First, we observe the case with (α,β) = (2,1). It is not difficult to see that K(d,n)  ≤  f2,1(d,n) for d  ≤  3, which means that we only need to check the base step for d  ≥  4. Simple calculations ensure that d(2,1) = 8. To conclude, the base step consists of pairs (d,n) satisfying

[formula]

As an example, we show in Figure [\ref=fig:12](a) the comparison results of f2,1(5,n) with K(5,n) and L(5,n). We observe f2,1(5,n)  ≥  K(5,n) for n  ≤  14, and f2,1(5,n)  ≥  L(5,n) for n  ≥  15. Indeed, BaseCaseCheck(2,1,3) returns Success after checking 316 pairs of (d,n). Therefore, for d  ≥  1, we have

[formula]

In the above bound f2,1(d,n), β = 1 was used to ensure the validity in low dimensions. Indeed, it is not difficult to see that f2,0(d,n) is not valid for d  ≤  3. Furthermore, for 4  ≤  d  ≤  6, we have

[formula]

and hence the proof method does not work for d  ≤  6. On the other hand, we can ensure that f2,0(d,n) is valid for d = 7 as confirmed from Figure [\ref=fig:12](b). As a matter of fact, BaseCaseCheck(2,0,7) returns Success, i.e., the base step holds for d  ≥  γ = 7. In this case, we set d(2,0) = 10 and checked pairs (d,n) satisfying

[formula]

which amount to 351 pairs. In sum, for d  ≥  7, we have

[formula]

Overall results

Table [\ref=tbl:all] summarizes the overall results. The second column shows the smallest integer β* for which BaseCaseCheck returns Success, for each α, where γ is fixed to 1. On the other hand, the third column shows the smallest γ* for which BaseCaseCheck returns Success, for each α, where β is fixed to 0. BaseCaseCheck was implemented in C.

For γ = 1, the best bound, i.e., one with the largest α confirmed in our computational environment, was f8,6(d,n). This result implies that we have

[formula]

for d  ≥  1. This upper bound improves Todd bound by three orders of magnitude in high dimensions. We note that it took about two days for BaseCaseCheck to return Success for this case.

For γ > 0, the best bound was f5,0(d,n) which holds only for d  ≥  65. In sum, for d  ≥  65, we have

[formula]

For a larger α, the computation was not done in two days and may need more computational resources.

A limitation of Kalai-Kleitman inequality

In the inductive step following from Kalai-Kleitman inequality, we need to prove f(d - 1,n - 1) + 2f(d,⌊n / 2⌋) + 2  ≤  f(d,n). In other words, we need to show that

[formula]

is less than or equal to one. In what follows, we identify several bounds which satisfy ()  >  1 for pairs (d,n) that cannot be included in the base step, i.e., n  ≥  2d. We may conclude that Kalai-Kleitman inequality cannot prove such bounds in a naive way.

Polynomial bounds

Let p(d,n) = nk for some constant k. For convenience, suppose that n is even. Then, now, () is bounded from below by

[formula]

Since the first term gets arbitrarily close to one while the second term is constant, () must be greater than one for sufficiently large n. It is not difficult to extend this approach to disprove general polynomial bounds focusing on pairs (d,n) satisfying n = md for an arbitrarily chosen constant m.

Approaching Hirsch bound

Motivated by Todd bound, we define fg(d,n) = (n - d)log 2(g(d)) which fits better with Hirsch bound n - d when g(d) is small. Note that in Todd bound, g(d) = d, while g(d) = d / α  +  β in ours. We show that there are pairs (d,n) satisfying ()  >  1 when g(d) =  log 2(d) and [formula], i.e., typical diminishing functions. Therefore, one can say that our bounds, where g(d) is non-diminishing, are almost the best possible in this direction.

First, consider the case with g(d) =  log 2(d). Let us focus on pairs (d,n) with n = d + 2d. Then, we obtain the graph shown in Figure [\ref=figlogsqrt](a), where the curved line shows the values of () for pairs (d,n) = (d,d + 2d), while the horizontal line shows one. Therefore, for these pairs, we have ()  >  1. On the other hand, for the case with [formula], it suffices to focus on pairs (d,n) = (d,d + d2). The corresponding graph is shown in Figure [\ref=figlogsqrt](b).

It is easy to see that for a fixed d, we have () < 1 for sufficiently large n even when g(d) =  log 2(d) and [formula]. Hence, one may restrict the polyhedra to those with many facets to improve the bound. However, this approach does not work because in the inductive step, we need to bound Δ(d,⌊n / 2⌋).

Concluding remarks

As an alternative approach, one can consider to solve the equation defined by Kalai-Kleitman inequality directly. For example, substituting Δ(3,n)  ≤  n - 3 to the equation for d = 4, we have an equation

[formula]

where f(n) simulates an upper bound on Δ(4,n). Simple calculations show that there is a solution f(n) = n log 2(n) + Cn + 2 where C is any constant. Choosing C appropriately, we have Δ(4,n)  ≤  f(n). However, for now, we are not sure how to propagate this idea into high dimensions.
