Exact closed probability-free kinetic equation for system of classical particles with retarded interactions: towards microscopic foundation of kinetics

Footnote to title of article.

Introduction

The problem of non-contradictory foundation of both equilibriun and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is not resolved over a hundred years. From time to time there are heated discussions, mainly about the use of the probability concept in the classical theory of many-body systems (see., eg, the discussion of this issue at the round table during 20th IUPAP International Conference on Statistical Physics [\cite=Leb] ).

The first attempts to use the laws of classical mechanics, coupled with the "molecular chaos" (Stosszahlansatz) probabilistic hypothesis by Boltzmann at the end of the XIX century, were immediately subjected to the very essential criticism from Loschmidt and Zermelo. They proved that Boltzmann's probabilistic assumptions contradict the exact theorems of classical mechanics [\cite=Kac1] [\cite=Kac] [\cite=Strien]. The essence of the Loschmidt and Zermelo arguments is as follows.

Loschmidt suggested that the transformation of time reversal t  →   - t is equivalent to all the velocities reversal [formula]. In this case, replacing [formula] really returns the system to its past states and the Boltzmann H-theorem is not valid. Moreover, there is no such function of state such as entropy, which by the replacement [formula] will not return to its previous value.

The Zermelo paradox is based on the Poincaré's recurrence theorem. This theorem states that any finite isolated dynamical system will, after a sufficiently long but finite time, return to a state arbitrarily close to the initial state.

Thus, the introduction of the probability concept into classical many-body dynamics allows to describe the irreversible phenomena, but this union of classical mechanics and probability theory is internally inconsistent.

In this connection it should be noted an exactly solvable discrete dynamical model (the ring model), proposed by Mark Kac [\cite=Kac1] [\cite=Kac]. This model has the properties of reversibility and recurrence [\cite=Gottwald] [\cite=Kozlov], but loses these properties with the introduction of very plausible probabilistic hypotheses. Therefore, the probability approach to foundation of thermodynamics is not satisfactory.

Thus, exact theorems of classical mechanics are at variance with both the probabilistic description of macroscopic systems, and their thermodynamic behavior. All these facts lead to the conclusion that microscopic foundation of thermodynamics in terms of classical mechanics is impossible.

One of the factors that could cause irreversible behavior systems is retardation of the interactions between the particles [\cite=ZZ]. Since the interactions delay is a relativistic effect, the description of the system evolution should be based on the theory of relativity. According to Currie's "The No Interaction Theorem"[\cite=Currie2] [\cite=Currie] [\cite=Trump], a Hamiltonian description of a system of interacting particles in terms of their coordinates qs and momenta ps is inconsistent with the principle of relativistic invariance. In other words, the Hamiltonian relativistic description of the system is possible in the case of non-interacting particles only (ideal relativistic gas).

The aim of this paper is the derivation and analysis of the exact closed relativistic equation of motion for the microscopic distribution function of a classical (non-quantum) system of identical particles.

Derivation of the basic equation

Let us define the microscopic distribution function in 6-dimensional coordinate-velocity space [formula]

[formula]

The calculation of the sums of type [formula], where [formula] is any "one-particle" function, will perform according to the rule

[formula]

After differentiating the distribution function ([\ref=f(r] [\ref=v] [\ref=t)]) with respect to time, we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let us express both terms [formula] and [formula] via the microscopic distribution function [formula].

Calculation of [formula]

First we transform the right-hand side of ([\ref=dot1-f]), using the rule ([\ref=mean-psi]) and the Fourier representation for delta-function. As a result we obtain

[formula]

Using the identity

[formula]

to this formula leads to the final expressions for [formula]:

[formula]

Calculation of [formula]

To calculate the function [formula], it is necessary to express [formula] via the microscopic distribution function [formula]. According to Newton's second law

[formula]

where [formula]  is the field's potential acting on the s-th particle by all the particles,

[formula]

[formula] is the potential energy of interaction between two resting particles, situated in points [formula] and [formula], [formula] is the interactions retardation between points [formula] and [formula].

Substitute ([\ref=Newton]) and ([\ref=loc-field]) into ([\ref=dot2-f]) and find

[formula]

Using the identity ([\ref=J-full]) leads to a significant simplification of this formula

[formula]

Basic equation

Combining relations ([\ref=dot1+2-f]), ([\ref=dot-f1-1]) and ([\ref=dot-f2-2]), we find the exact closed basic equation for the microscopic distribution function [formula]:

The irreversibility of the basic equation

Let us consider the qualitative properties of the basic equation ([\ref=main-eq]), with special emphasis on the time-irreversibility problem of its solutions. For this purpose we expand the integrand in the basic equation ([\ref=main-eq]) in powers of [formula] and substitute the result in this equation. As a result we have

Let us consider the changes every of the term in this equation under the Loschmidt's �time reversal transformation

[formula]

According to the definition ([\ref=f(r] [\ref=v] [\ref=t)]), we have

[formula]

Thus, the time reversal operation leads to change of left-hand side sign of equation ([\ref=righr-hand]). In the right-hand side of this equation a such change of sign takes a place for the terms with even values n only.

Therefore, equation ([\ref=righr-hand]) is invariant with respect to time reversal if and only if there is no delay interactions, i.e. [formula]. In other words, the interactions delay leads to irreversible behavior of a system of interacting particles.

Physical interpretation of first terms expansion over interactions retardation

Let us consider the expansion ([\ref=main-equat-ext]) in powers of the interactions retardation up to the first non-vanishing term Expression ([\ref=left-Boltz]) in the form completely corresponds to the left-hand side of the Boltzmann equation taking into account the external field [formula]. The second term ([\ref=Vlasov]) in its form is similar to the self-consistent field term in the Vlasov equation. However, the corresponding term in the Vlasov equation contains averaged (ie probabilistic) distribution function and therefore it is some approximate expression. Equation ([\ref=righr-hand]) contains the microscopic non-averaged distribution function and therefore it is the exact expression. The third term ([\ref=retard1]) has a remote likeness with collision integral on the retarded part of the field generated by all the particles of the system. In this case, instead of the interatomic potential [formula] this part of the equation contains the "renormalized potential" of the form [formula].

Discussion of the results

The main results of this work are as follows.

The exact equation of motion for the microscopic distribution function of a system consisting of identical interacting particles is derived. The interaction potential between the particles assumed an arbitrary function of the distance. Effect of the interactions retardation is taken into account.

Despite the external resemblance of the basic equation ([\ref=main-eq]) with the Boltzmann equation, there are fundamental differences between these equations.

The Boltzmann equation contains a probabilistic distribution function, while the basic equation ([\ref=main-eq]) contains the exact microscopic distribution function.

The Boltzmann equation is based on a simplified conception that the particles are moving freely between their collisions. Interactions between particles are taken into account by the collision integral, having a probabilistic character. This picture is applicable (to some extent) to the rarefied gas, consisting of hard spheres. Unlike Boltzmann equation, the basic equation ([\ref=main-eq]) is free from all these limitations. The interaction between the particles is described by an arbitrary potential [formula]. Each of the particles is influenced by all the other particles.

The interaction between the particles in the framework of the Boltzmann equation is taken into account by the collision integral. In this connection time evolution of the probabilistic distribution function is represented as a sequence of mainly pairwise collisions of particles. In the framework of the basic deterministic equation ([\ref=main-eq]), each particle interacts continuously with all the other particles without separation on two-body, three-body, four-body,  collisions.

Apart from the Boltzmann equation, there are other methods to describe the kinetic processes [\cite=Keizer]. All existing methods for describing the kinetic processes, including BBGKY method [\cite=Bog] [\cite=Born] [\cite=Kirkwood] [\cite=Yvon], are based on probabilistic assumptions.
