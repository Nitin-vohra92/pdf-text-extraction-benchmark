Searching for an oscillating massive scalar field as a dark matter candidate using atomic hyperfine frequency comparisons

While thoroughly tested [\citep=will:1993fk] [\citep=*will:2014la], the theory of General Relativity (GR) is currently challenged by theoretical considerations and by galactic and cosmological observations. Indeed, the development of a quantum theory of gravitation or of a theory that would unify gravitation with the other fundamental interactions leads to deviations from GR. These modifications are usually characterized by the introduction of new fields in addition to the space-time metric to model the gravitational interaction. For example, string theory generically predicts the existence of new scalar fields (dilaton, moduli, axions). In addition, in the current cosmological paradigm, some galactic and cosmological observations are explained by the introduction of cold Dark Matter (DM) and of Dark Energy. Little is currently known about these two components that constitute the major part of our Universe. They can be interpreted as new types of matter (although they have not been directly detected so far), as a modification of the theory of gravitation or even as a combination of the two.

The introduction of non minimally coupled scalar fields additionally to GR (tensor-scalar theories) generally leads to a space-time dependence of fundamental constants, which can then be searched for by experiments that test the Einstein equivalence principle (EEP) like weak equivalence principle (WEP) tests or tests of local position or Lorentz invariance (LPI and LLI) [\cite=will:1993fk]. In the past, spectroscopy of different atomic transitions has been widely used to carry out such searches, and has set the tightest limits so far on a possible present-day space-time variation of fundamental constants [\cite=van-tilburg:2015fj] [\cite=ashby:2007dq] [\cite=blatt:2008kx] [\cite=cingoz:2007qf] [\cite=fortier:2007bh] [\cite=rosenband:2008fk] [\cite=guena:2012ys] [\cite=leefer:2013xy] [\cite=godun:2014sf] [\cite=huntemann:2014nr] [\cite=ferrell:2007mz] [\cite=blatt:2008kx] [\cite=guena:2012ys] [\cite=tobar:2013gf] [\cite=peil:2013ul] [\cite=leefer:2013xy].

Such scalar fields could be a candidate for DM and/or dark energy. If they are massive, they will oscillate at a frequency related to their mass, leading to an oscillation of fundamental constants whose frequency depends on the scalar field mass. Recently atomic spectroscopy of Dy has been used to constrain such oscillations [\cite=van-tilburg:2015fj] of the fine structure constant (α). In this letter we present limits on possible oscillations of a linear combination of constants (α, quark mass and Λ quantum chromodynamics - QCD - mass scale) using ≈   six years of highly accurate hyperfine frequency comparison of Rb and Cs atoms. This provides complementary constraints to those from Dy spectroscopy [\cite=van-tilburg:2015fj] which is sensitive to α alone. When assuming a variation of α only, our results improve the limits of [\cite=van-tilburg:2015fj] by over an order of magnitude.

Tensor-scalar theories of gravitation have been widely studied as an extension of GR (see for example [\cite=jordan:1949vn] [\cite=brans:1961fk] [\cite=fujii:2003fi] [\cite=damour:1992ys] [\cite=damour:1996fk] and references therein) motivated by unification theories [\cite=green:1988oa] [\cite=damour:1994fk] [\cite=damour:1994uq] [\cite=gasperini:2002kx] [\cite=damour:2002vn] [\cite=*damour:2002ys] or by models of Dark Energy [\cite=ratra:1988vn] [\cite=caldwell:1998kx] [\cite=peebles:1993fk] [\cite=hees:2012kx]. Moreover, models of a light scalar field coupled to DM have been proposed [\cite=damour:1990fk] [\cite=alimi:2008zr] [\cite=carroll:2009fh] [\cite=carroll:2010xw] [\cite=mohapi:2015pi] as well as bosonic models of DM [\cite=preskill:1983fv] [\cite=abbott:1983db] [\cite=weinberg:1978rc]. In this letter, we focus on a massive scalar field model of DM parametrized by the action (see e.g. [\cite=damour:2010zr])

[formula]

with κ = 8πG / c4 where G is Newton's constant, R the curvature scalar of the space-time metric gμν, φ a dimensionless scalar field , [formula] is the Lagrangian density of the Standard Model of particles depending on the matter fields Ψ and [formula] parametrizes the interaction between the scalar field and matter. We will consider a quadratic scalar self-interaction

[formula]

where the normalisation of the potential has been chosen such that mφ has the dimension of a mass.

We consider linear couplings between the scalar field and the matter fields similar to the ones introduced by Damour and Donoghue [\cite=damour:2010zr] [\cite=damour:2010ve] . The interacting part of the Lagrangian [formula] is given by Eq. (12) of [\cite=damour:2010zr]

[formula]

with Fμν the standard electromagnetic Faraday tensor, μ0 the magnetic permeability, FAμν the gauge invariant gluon strength tensor, g3 is the QCD gauge coupling, β3 denotes the β function for the running of g3, mi the mass of the fermions, γmi the anomalous dimension giving the energy running of the masses of the QCD-coupled fermions and ψi the fermions spinor. This Lagrangian is parametrized by five dimensionless coefficients de,dme,dmu,dmd and dg that characterize the coupling between the scalar and standard model fields. It is well known that such a model will induce a violation of the Einstein Equivalence Principle for baryonic matter. This implies a violation of the WEP [\cite=damour:1994fk] [\cite=damour:2010zr] [\cite=damour:2010ve] [\cite=damour:2012zr] as well as a violation of LPI through a modification of the gravitational redshift [\cite=damour:1997qv] [\cite=*damour:1999fk] [\cite=nordtvedt:2002uq] [\cite=hees:2015ve] and a space-time variation of the constants of Nature [\cite=damour:1994fk] [\cite=nordtvedt:2002uq] [\cite=bekenstein:1982zr] [\cite=sandvik:2002ly] [\cite=uzan:2011vn] [\cite=olive:2008fk] [\cite=minazzoli:2014xz] [\cite=*hees:2014uq]. In particular, Damour and Donoghue [\cite=damour:2010zr] [\cite=damour:2010ve] have shown that the particular form of the interacting Lagrangian leads to a linear dependence of 5 constants of Nature with respect to the scalar field

The Klein-Gordon equation deriving from the action ([\ref=eq:action]) in a flat Friedmann-Lematre-Robertson-Walker space-time is given by [\cite=damour:1994fk]

[formula]

where H is the Hubble constant and the dot denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time t. The Hubble damping (due to the second term of ([\ref=KG])) can safely be neglected as long as mφ >  > 2  ~  1.5  ×  10- 33eV/c2, and for experimental durations <  < 1 / H, with both conditions largely satisfied in our case. The source term [formula] is due to the non-minimal coupling between the scalar field and standard matter and is directly related to the baryonic matter density (see Eq. (3.5b) from [\cite=damour:1994fk]). Therefore, it will evolve with a characteristic time scale of 1 / H and for periods much shorter, it can be considered as constant. Under these assumptions, the scalar field evolution is periodic

[formula]

The oscillating part of the solution has been developed in [\cite=arvanitaki:2015qy] [\cite=van-tilburg:2015fj] where the source term has not been considered. The scalar field gives rise to a density [formula] and a pressure [formula]. Substituting from ([\ref=eq:phi_sol]) and ([\ref=eq:V]) and averaging over one period of the cosine we find that the second term of ([\ref=eq:phi_sol]) does not contribute to the pressure. It thus acts as a pressureless fluid which we identify as DM with density

[formula]

As mentioned in [\cite=arvanitaki:2015qy] [\cite=derevianko:2016yu] and as can be seen directly from Eqs. ([\ref=eq:const_phi]), the scalar field oscillations from Eq. ([\ref=eq:phi_sol]) will produce similar oscillations on the fine structure constant, on the masses of the fermions and on the QCD mass scale. Atomic transition frequencies are sensitive to possible variations of the constants of the Standard Model. The sensitivity of the frequency ratio X of two atomic transitions is characterized by d ln X = kαd ln α + kμd ln (me / mp)  +  kqd ln (mq  /  Λ3) where the k's represent sensitivity coefficients [\cite=flambaum:2004fk]. Recent atomic structure calculations have shown that for the Rb/Cs ground state hyperfine transitions kα =  - 0.49, kμ = 0 and kq =  - 0.021 [\cite=prestage:1995pl] [\cite=flambaum:2006pr] [\cite=dzuba:2008uq] [\cite=dinh:2009fk]. In contrast, ratios of electric-dipole transition frequencies, e.g. in optical clocks or in Dy, have only kα  ≠  0 and are thus insensitive to variations of the other fundamental constants. The dependence of the Rb/Cs frequency ratio on kα and kq associated with the harmonic evolution of the constants of Nature from Eqs. ([\ref=eq:const_phi]) and ([\ref=eq:phi_sol]) shows that the ratio of Rb/Cs hyperfine frequencies also exhibits a harmonic signature yRb / yCs  ≈    +   cos (ωt + δ) where y  =  ν  /  ν0 are the frequencies normalized to their nominal values. The amplitude of oscillation is given by

[formula]

with [formula] the DM energy density (in our galaxy, [formula] GeV/cm3 [\cite=mcmillan:2011vn]). In the last equation, we have assumed that the DM energy density is entirely due to the scalar field (see Eq. ([\ref=eq:rho])).

We use the dual Cs/Rb atomic fountain clock FO2 at LNE-SYRTE that operates simultaneously on both species thereby providing primary (Cs) and secondary (Rb) realizations of the SI second in parallel [\cite=Guena2010] [\cite=Guena2012] [\cite=Guena2014]. A detailed description of the experimental apparatus can be found in [\cite=Guena2010] [\cite=Guena2012] [\cite=guena:2012ys] [\cite=Guena2014], here we only recall the main features. Rb and Cs atoms are simultaneously laser-cooled, launched, state-selected, and probed with the Ramsey interrogation method, and finally selectively detected using time resolved laser-induced fluorescence, in the same vacuum chamber (see e.g. Fig. 2 of [\cite=Guena2012]). The |F = 1,mF = 0〉  →  |F = 2,mF = 0〉 hyperfine transition frequency of 87Rb at ≈  6.8 GHz and the |F = 4,mF = 0〉  →  |F = 3,mF = 0〉 hyperfine transition frequency of 133Cs at ≈  9.2 GHz are simultaneously measured against the same ultrastable microwave reference at the 1.6 s fountain cycle, corrected for all known systematic effects (cold collisions, 2nd order Zeeman shifts, Blackbody radiation, etc... [\cite=Guena2012] [\cite=Guena2014]), and then averaged over synchronous intervals of Δt0  =  864 s duration.

Our data set consists of measurements of yRb / yCs spanning November 2009 to February 2016. The measurements are continuous with some gaps due to maintenance and investigation of systematics, giving an overall duty cycle of ≈   45% over more than six years (see Fig. [\ref=fig:raw]).

The noise is roughly stationary over the complete data set, and characterized by white frequency noise with two different amplitudes depending on the averaging time (see Fig. 7 and related discussion in [\cite=Guena2014]). This behavior is well understood and reproducible. It results from the operation of FO2 with atom numbers that are intentionally varied in order to correct for the collisional frequency shifts [\cite=Guena2014]. In the frequency domain we model the measurement noise by a frequency dependent variance σ2o(ω) given by

[formula]

which is equivalent to the noise levels shown in Fig. 7 of [\cite=Guena2014].

Our goal is to search for a sinusoidal signature in the Rb/Cs atomic frequency ratio measurements. Our methodology is similar to the one used in [\cite=van-tilburg:2015fj] and is fully described in [\cite=scargle:1982fk]. For each frequency ω we fit a signal of type [formula] to the sequence of measurements O(ti)  =  yRb(ti) / yCs(ti) - 1. We perform a Bayesian inference of the parameters Aω,Cω and Sω using a Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm [\cite=gregory:2010qv]. We assume the observations to be independent and the errors to be normally distributed and we use flat prior probability distribution functions of the parameters. The highest analyzed angular frequency [formula] is chosen to be π  /  Δt0. The Bayesian MC inference allows us to also analyze observations for angular frequencies smaller than 2π / T (with T the total time span of the measurements) where the correlations between the parameters become significant. For ω  >  2π / T we have verified independently that an ordinary least squares fit of Aω,Cω and Sω yields the same result as the Bayesian MC algorithm.

For each occurrence of our MC sampling, we can estimate the normalized power spectrum

[formula]

where No is the number of measurements and σ2o(ω) is their estimated variance given in ([\ref=eq:noise]).

In addition, for each frequency, we perform a Bayesian MC inference of the parameters Aω,Cω and Sω with O(ti) = 0, which we transform into a normalized power Pe(ω) using Eq. ([\ref=eq:power]). The obtained probability distribution of Pe(ω) is representative of the distribution in the case of white noise. For high frequencies ω  >  2π / T, the resulting noise power spectrum is equivalent to the modified periodogram introduced in Eq. (10) of [\cite=scargle:1982fk] which is exponentially distributed. This allows a consistency check of our method by comparing the distribution obtained with our MC sampler with the theoretical one which is given by the cumulative distribution function Prob [formula]. For low frequencies, Pe(ω) does not coincide with the modified periodogram of [\cite=scargle:1982fk] anymore and its statistical properties are more complex (see also [\cite=van-tilburg:2015fj]). Therefore, we rely only on our Bayesian MC inference for our estimate at low frequencies (ω  ≤  2π / T).

We determine a detection threshold, which is the ensemble of power levels Pth(ω) (for each frequency) such that the statistical probability of finding at least one power larger than that level in case of only noise is smaller than p0 = 5%, i.e. if at any frequency we find a value of P(ω)  ≥  Pth(ω) and interpret it as a detection, the probability of it being a false detection is less than 5%. We determine this level following Sec. III.c. of [\cite=scargle:1982fk]. Considering a set of Nω independent frequencies, the Bayesian inference allows us to determine the level Pth(ω) such that Prob [formula]. The probability Probth that at least one value in the noise power spectrum is higher than its corresponding Pth(ω) is then given by

[formula]

where the product is over the Nω independent frequencies ωj. Once again, for high frequencies, we have checked that the obtained values correspond to the analytic results given in Eq. (18) of [\cite=scargle:1982fk].

Finally, we derive a 95% confidence limit upper bound on the estimated power by taking the 95-th percentile value of our MC sampling of P(ω). This corresponds to the maximum allowed power (at 95% confidence) given the actually measured power in our data and assuming that all of that is a signal (as also used in [\cite=van-tilburg:2015fj]). We have checked that our estimated limit is consistent with the analytic expression (see Eqs. (15-16) of [\cite=scargle:1982fk]) valid for high frequencies.

In the top of Fig. [\ref=fig:power], we present the results of this analysis for the Rb/Cs data set. Since the measured power spectrum is always smaller than the corresponding detection threshold, we can conclude that there is no evidence of a harmonic modulation. In the bottom of Fig. [\ref=fig:power], we present the same results in terms of the amplitude of a hypothetical harmonic oscillation defined by [formula] instead of the power spectrum. The figure shows the observed upper limit on the amplitude of a harmonic modulation allowed by the observations. These results can be directly used to constrain any model that predicts a periodic variation of the ratio of the Rb/Cs hyperfine frequencies, e.g. massive scalar fields with quadratic coupling to standard matter [\cite=Stadnik2015a].

Using Eq. ([\ref=eq:amp]), we can now transform our amplitude spectrum into limits on [formula]. Fig. [\ref=fig:d] shows our estimation and 95% CL upper bound on this combination as a function of the scalar field mass mφ  =  ω / c2. We can exclude couplings larger than 5.3 ×  10- 4 at any mφ within our range, with our most stringent limit being as low as 3.8 ×  10- 9 at mφ = 1.4  ×  10- 23 eV/c2. Our limits are complementary to those of [\cite=van-tilburg:2015fj] and also to those coming from tests of the weak equivalence principle [\cite=damour:2010zr] as they probe different combinations of the coupling constants di. If we assume that the scalar field is coupled only to electromagnetism (only de  ≠  0) then our limits improve those of [\cite=van-tilburg:2015fj] by more than an order of magnitude, and are far more stringent than those from WEP tests in the range of mφ considered here (cf. Fig. 1 of [\cite=arvanitaki:2016qv]).

In conclusion, massive scalar fields are a possible candidate for dark matter, and can be searched for by searching for a harmonic oscillation of fundamental constants, which in turn leads to an oscillation of frequency ratios of atomic transitions. In this letter, we have presented such a search, using over six years of precision measurements of the Rb/Cs ground state hyperfine frequency ratio at LNE-SYRTE. We see no evidence for an oscillating massive scalar field, but set upper limits on a linear combination of coupling constants between such a field and standard matter. Our results are complementary to previous measurements which constrain other parameter combinations, and improve previous results by over an order of magnitude when allowing only coupling to electromagnetism. In the next years, and with the recent rapid improvement of atomic clocks, it will be possible to carry out similar searches with other types of transitions thereby further limiting the parameter space for massive scalar fields as dark matter candidates and their coupling to standard matter.
