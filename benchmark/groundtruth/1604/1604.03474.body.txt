Q-enhanced racetrack micro-resonators

Introduction

Microring resonators are highly versatile elements within integrated photonics with applications as add-drop multiplexers [\cite=little1], optical filters [\cite=little2], optical switches [\cite=almeida], sensors [\cite=vos], modulators [\cite=xu], or in slow light systems based on coupled resonator waveguides [\cite=scheuer]. Ring microresonators can be implemented in a variety of optical integration platforms: silicon on insulator (SOI)[\cite=bogaerts], silica on silicon [\cite=ou], polymer [\cite=rabiei], SiN/SiO [\cite=tien], GaAs/AlGaAs [\cite=van], or InP/InGaAsP [\cite=grover].

Irrespective of the specific application, a key parameter characterizing the performance of a resonator is the quality factor Q [\cite=bogaerts]. In the time domain, the Q-factor of a resonant mode is proportional to the 1 / e decay time of the electromagnetic energy stored in that mode. In the frequency domain, it is equivalently characterized by the sharpness of the resonance relative to its central frequency. Its value is determined by the total loss, including both the effects due to coupling to an external circuit and those associated to the propagation in the ring. In the absence of external coupling, the intrinsic Q-factor is called the unloaded Q of the resonator.

There are various contributions to the ring loss in an unloaded resonator: the intrinsic propagation loss of the waveguide material, the effect of the roughness of the waveguide walls or the effects due to the bending in the curved waveguide sections. In high contrast integrated optics platforms, the effect of bending can be negligible even for very small radii of curvature. Such is the case in SOI photonic circuits. In this platform, on the other hand, the intrinsic propagation losses are relatively high. The converse situation is found, for instance, in SiN/SiO integrated circuits, where intrinsic losses are very small, but the reduced waveguide core/cladding refractive index contrast relative to that of SOI results in higher values of the radiation loss due to waveguide curvature.

A pulley type configuration, with the coupling bus waveguide surrounding the resonator, has been shown to reduce the radiation loss and to provide very high Q factors when used in microdisk [\cite=hosseini] [\cite=hu] and microring [\cite=cai] resonators, even though improvements have been more elusive in the case of racetrack microresonators [\cite=cai].

In the pulley geometry, the bus waveguide is a design element both of the resonator and the coupling system, resulting a largely restrictive configuration. In this work, we exploit the radiation quenching properties of the external slab in pulley resonators but with independence to the coupling of the resonator. This is supplemented with the lateral offset [\cite=kitoh] technique to reduce the loss due to the transition from the straight to the bent transmission section. The resulting geometry is shown to provide large improvements in the Q factors of racetrack microresonators. This is particularly interesting when the radiation loss dominates the intrinsic propagation loss, as it is the case in silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits. At the same time, the versatility of racetrack microresonators as key design elements of integrated optical circuits is kept intact, since the geometry modifications affect at the resonator itself and not its coupling to the optical circuit.

Proposed scheme

There exist two main and independent radiation loss mechanisms associated with the propagation in curved waveguides [\cite=lewin] [\cite=heiblum] [\cite=marcuse]. The first one is the coupling mismatch existing between the optical mode field in the straight waveguide section and that of a curved waveguide with constant curvature. The second one is the continuous radiation loss of the modal field in the curved transmission sections.

These two sources of radiation loss are addressed independently in the proposed scheme. The losses at the waveguide transitions are dealt with using the lateral offset technique [\cite=kitoh]. For the radiation of the bent sections, the intrinsic radiation quenching mechanisms of pulley resonators [\cite=cai] is adopted. With an adequate design, the waveguide around the resonator in a pulley configuration has the effect of reducing the radiation loss when the modes in the inner and outer coupled structures are phase mismatched. This is similar to the result of phase mismatch in asymmetric couplers [\cite=marcusec], where the coupler supermodes do not have the typical even and odd distributions of symmetric couplers, but are mainly localized at one of the guides and evanescent at the other. For a bent guiding structure the presence of a nonsynchronous parallel curved slab has the effect of reducing the radiation loss [\cite=cai].

The conventional geometry of a racetrack micro-resonator is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig::geometria] (a). This geometry is fully defined by the waveguide width w, the radius of the bent sections R and the length of the straight sections Ls. It can be compared with the proposed scheme in Fig. [\ref=fig::geometria] (b). The modifications include a lateral shift loff of the straight waveguides and the existence of radiation quenching curved exterior sectors of width we and inner radius of curvature Re. The nonsynchronous condition of the curved coupler will require that either we < w or we > w. The angular extent of the exterior sectors is limited by the angular parameters θl, l = 1,2, that are intended to be adjusted to permit the coupling of the resonator to other structures either from one side or both sides. Values of θl greater than 0, are suboptimal in relation with the maximal reduction in the radiation loss at [formula]. This effect is studied in the following section.

The reduction of the radiation loss and the increase of the Q-factor by using an external slab can also be employed in microring resonators, as shown in Figures [\ref=fig::ring] (a) and (b) for a side coupled and add-drop microring, respectively.

Results

For the analysis of the proposal, a buried channel waveguide geometry typical from silicon nitride optical circuits [\cite=tien] has been assumed, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig::guia], as well as the typical materials of this technology. The refractive indices of silica and silicon nitride have been taken as 1.4501 and 1.9792, respectively. For all the calculations, w =  and h = . A quasi-TE mode field has been assumed, with the electric field predominantly polarized along the wider dimension in Fig. [\ref=fig::guia]. The 3D problem has been reduced to 2D using the effective index method [\cite=tamir]. Solutions of the 2D model has been obtained using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method as implemented in the MEEP software package [\cite=meep].

In order to determine the optimal geometries, the configuration shown in Fig. [\ref=fig::opt] has been used with θ1  =  θ2  =  θ. The radiation loss has been determined by injecting an input signal in the upper waveguide and the measurement of the transmission in the lower waveguide. This has permitted a systematic parametric search for the optimal configurations. Since there are two independent loss mechanisms, the search of the optimal value of loff has been performed separately to those of Re and we, keeping we = 0. The optimization of Re and we has been carried out with loff = 0.

Values of θ1  =  θ2  =   and Ls  =   have been assumed in all cases and two different values of R have been considered, R =  and R = . For the first of them, the optimal parameters obtained are loff  =  , we  =  , and Re  =  . For R = , loff  =  , we  =  , and Re  =  . The calculated transmission loss is a relatively smooth function of the design parameters, compatible with typical fabrication tolerances.

The two designs have been characterized in an unloaded standalone configuration, without any coupling to an external circuit, by injecting an input signal in the upper straight section of the resonator and determining the frequencies and decay rates of the modes from the temporal evolution of the field at the opposite side of the resonator. The filter diagonalization method [\cite=harminv] has been employed to determine the resonances and their respective Q-factors.

The calculated results in the spectral region between and are shown in Figures [\ref=fig::Q] (a) and (b) for the cases R =  and R = , respectively. Resonance frequencies and Q-factors for the conventional racetrack geometry are shown with squares. The results for the modified geometry proposed in this work are shown with open circles and show an improvement of the Q-factor by over 100% in most cases.

For the two cases, the geometry with [formula] has also been studied. The results are displayed with closed circles and show the expected improvement in the Q-factor. All the parameters optimized for the θ1  =  θ2  =   case have been kept in these calculations. An intermediate design alternative to the symmetric sectoring of the radiation quenching slabs could be to use θ1  ≠   and [formula]. This could be used in side coupled racetrack resonators. For a racetrack in an add-drop configuration or as part of coupled resonator optical waveguides, the symmetric sectoring seems the most reasonable option.

The values of the Q-factor illustrated in the calculations could be increased further, at the cost of reducing the free spectral range, simply by enlarging the straight waveguide sections since the Q-factor scales linearly with the total ring length [\cite=bogaerts] when losses are kept constant. This would be unpractical in the presence of high intrinsic material losses, such as in the SOI platform, but not in other technologies with lower intrinsic losses, like silicon nitride.

The loaded Q-factor of the structures has been also addressed by studying the transmission properties of a R =  racetrack microresonator side coupled to a bus waveguide with and without the Q-enhanced modifications of their geometry. The bus waveguide is also wide and the separation between the two coupler waveguides is . The transmission function in the spectral range between and are shown in Figure [\ref=fig::transmision] (c) and the transmission group delay in Figure [\ref=fig::transmision] (d). The results for our design are shown with solid lines and those of the conventional geometry with dashed lines. The coupling between the bus waveguide and the resonator is identical in the two cases illustrated in Figures [\ref=fig::transmision] (a) and (b), yielding exactly the same contribution to the total Q from the coupling of the resonator. The data obtained shows, on the other hand, deeper and narrower resonances in all the band for the Q-enhanced geometry, consistently with the significantly larger values of the intrinsic unloaded Q previously determined.

Conclusion

In this work, a modified racetrack microresonator design has been proposed and analyzed. The new geometry aims to reduce the radiation losses, while fully keeping the original versatile connectivity properties of the device as part of integrated optical circuits. The proposal is particularly interesting for integrated photonics platforms with radiation losses due to curvatures potentially dominating the total propagation loss, such as is the case of silicon nitride.

Computer simulations of loaded and unloaded resonators show the expected increase of the Q-factor in the new optimized geometries. Even though device sizes have been kept relatively small in order to bound the computation times, the quality factor scales linearly with the total ring length [\cite=bogaerts], and larger Q-factors should be easily attainable at the cost of reducing the free spectral range. This is an advantage in the implementation of racetrack micro-resonators with ultra-low loss optical integration platforms, such as SiN/SiO, where the attenuation in the straight waveguide segments is very small and the radiation due to bent sections can be largely mitigated with the scheme proposed in this work.

It is noteworthy that the same design considerations used for the control of the radiation loss in the curved sections can be applied also to microring resonators, limiting the radiation reduction slab to an angular sector such that the normal evanescent coupling of the ring resonator to a side structure is conveniently permitted.
