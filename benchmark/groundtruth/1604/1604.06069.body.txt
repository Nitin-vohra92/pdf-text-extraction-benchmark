Introduction

Eisenbud and Harris conjectured that an algebraic curve of high genus lies on a surface of low degree (which they proved for curves of very large degree). They observed constraints on the Hilbert function of a general hyperplane section Γ, which imply that Γ lies on a curve C of low degree. We investigate this situation under deformation. Given a set of sufficiently many points Γ  ⊂  C with C linearly normal, we show that for every deformation of [formula] with constant hΓ(2) the curve C deforms along with Γ.

Let X be a reduced irreducible nondegenerate curve of degree n and genus g in [formula]. Castelnuovo showed in the late 19th century that the genus is bounded by a quadratic polynomial π0(n,r) in n with leading term [formula]. He also showed that curves of maximal genus must lie on a unique surface S of minimal degree r, at least as long as n  ≥  2r + 3.

Castelnuovo's approach was extended by Eisenbud and Harris in 1982 who defined functions [formula] (1  ≤  α  ≤  r) and n0(r) and showed that any curve X with degree n  ≥  n0 and genus g > πα(n,r) must lie on a surface of degree ≤  r - 1 + α. [\cite=Harris]. Here n0(r) = 2r + 2 for r  ≥  7 (slightly worse for r < 7).

They further conjectured that the restriction on n could be lowered:

Let [formula] be a nondegenerate reduced irreducible curve of genus g and degree n  ≥  2r + 3 + 2α. If g > πα(n,r), then X lies on a surface of degree at most r - 1 + α.

They proved the conjecture for α = 1 [\cite=Harris]. The next case α = 2 (r  ≥  7) was established by Petrakiev in 2008 [\cite=Petra].

The proofs proceed by a careful analysis of the Hilbert function hΓ(l) of a general hyperplane section [formula]. Here hΓ(l) is the rank of the l-th graded piece of the homogeneous coordinate ring of Γ.

Castelnuovo obtains his bound from showing that hΓ(l)  ≥   min (n,lr + 1). On the other hand, if n  ≥  2r + 3 and hΓ(2) = 2r + 1, then the quadrics containing Γ intersect in a unique rational normal curve of degree r in H. The surface S of minimal degree is obtained as the intersection of all quadrics which contain X.

Eisenbud and Harris' proof for α = 1 uses that hΓ(2) = 2r + 2 for curves with n  ≥  2r + 5 and g > π1(n,r). They show that the quadrics through Γ intersect in an elliptic normal curve.

These approaches suggest the following supporting conjecture which (except for part (ii)) has been noted and studied by Reid [\cite=Reid], and later by Petrakiev [\cite=Petra]:

Let [formula] be a general hyperplane section of a nondegenerate reduced irreducible curve of degree n. Assume that  Γ imposes 2r + 1 + α conditions on quadrics for some 0  ≤  α  ≤  r - 2. If one of the following holds

α  ≤  r - 3 and n  ≥  2r + 3 + 2α,

α = r - 2 and n  ≥  4r + 1 = 2r + 5 + 2α,

then Γ lies on a reduced irreducible curve C of degree at most r + α. C is a component of the intersection of the quadrics containing Γ.

For fixed r, the numerical restrictions on n and α cannot be improved [\cite=Reid],[\cite=EGH].

In addition to the cases α = 0,1 mentioned above, this conjecture is known for α = 2, r  ≥  5 and α = 3, r  ≥  7 [\cite=Petra]. For arbitrary α  ≤  r - 3, it is known, if Γ lies on a two-dimensional rational normal scroll [\cite=Fano], [\cite=Reid].

In this note, we try to collect further evidence by investigating the following infinitesimal version of ([\ref=con11]):

Suppose Γ is a set of n points in [formula] satisfying both the assumptions and the conclusion of ([\ref=con11]). Is every deformation of  Γ induced by a deformation of C?

Our setup deals with the simplest case, namely that of linearly normal smooth curves.

To describe our results, let 0  ≤  α  ≤  r - 2 and consider the open subset of the Hilbert scheme of curves of genus g = α and degree d = g + r corresponding to smooth irreducible curves embedded by a complete linear system. Using the universal family, we can construct a variety H(n,α) parametrizing subschemes of such curves consisting of pairwise distinct points. H(n,α) is smooth and irreducible.

Further, let P(n) be the open subset of the Hilbert scheme of length n-subschemes of [formula] corresponding to subschemes Γ consisting of pairwise distinct points, and consider the canonical restriction map on P(n). is a determinantal variety.

The embedding of C in [formula] yields a map F(n,α):H(n,α)  →  P(n,α).

If  0  ≤  α  ≤  r - 3 and n  ≥  2r + 3 + 2α or α = r - 2 and n  ≥  4r + 1, then F(n,α) maps H(n,α) isomorphically on a dense open subset of a component of P(n,α).

If  0  ≤  α  ≤  r - 2 and n  ≥  2r + α + 5, and C is a fixed curve, then F(n,α) is locally an isomorphism in a general subscheme Γ of C.

If  0  ≤  α  ≤  r - 2 and n  ≥  2r + α + 5, then P(n,α) has an irreducible component whose general point lies in the image of F(n,α).

The bounds in ([\ref=thm13]) correspond to those predicted by ([\ref=con11]). They are sharp, see ([\ref=ex34]).

Our proofs proceed by analyzing the corresponding map on the Zariski tangent spaces. Each statement is equivalent to the surjectivity of the canonical composite map for [formula].

Writing this question reduces to showing that [formula].

As PL is a quotient of [formula] (pri:C  ×  C  ×  C  →  C the canonical projections), we are led to study conditions on line bundles L1, L2 and L3 which guarantee the vanishing of

The latter question can be resolved by a suitable filtration of a direct image, similarly to the approach in [\cite=Laz].

Interestingly, our proof does not require the points of Γ to be in linearly general position. If the curve C has degree 2g + 2, it cannot have a trisecant line, but may have a foursecant plane. A 5-secant plane is not possible, but there could be a 5-secant 3-plane; for hyperelliptic C, there could even be a 6-secant-3-plane.

The proof even works for an arbitrary divisor on C without assuming that its support consists of pairwise distinct points.

In the last section, we briefly comment on our assumption of linear normality of C and give two applications of our methods, on the question of generation of ideal sheaves by quadrics and on the cohomology of the square of the ideal sheaf.

These results were obtained in 1990-91 at UCLA, but remained unpublished when I did not continue my academic career. As I recently found that the techniques can be applied to study syzygies of curves, I decided to publish the results, after updating my notes with more recent developments.

I am grateful to Rob Lazarsfeld for many helpful discussions and encouragement. I am also indebted to Aaron Bertram who first asked the questions answered by ([\ref=thm32]) and ([\ref=prop42]) (they were communicated to me by Lazarsfeld) which turned out to be pivotal for this paper. Furthermore, I profited from discussions with Mark Green and Christoph Rippel.

Notations and conventions

We work over an algebraically closed field K of arbitrary characteristic.

Given a curve C, we will write pr1, pr2 for the projections on C  ×  C, and Δ for the diagonal. On C  ×  C, we define sheaves associated with a line bundle L as follows: [formula], [formula].

If L is very ample and [formula] is the embedding by H0L, then ML  =  Ω1¶(1)|C, [formula].

pri also denotes the projections from C3 = C  ×  C  ×  C onto the i-th component, and pr1,2 denotes the projection on the first two components.

Δi,j is the diagonal {(x1,x2,x3)|xi = xj}  ⊂  C  ×  C  ×  C.

For a line bundle L, let [formula]. If L is very ample, then M2,L is a vector bundle on C  ×  C.

For very ample L so that the ideal of C in the embedding by H0L is generated by quadrics, we write [formula].

Deforming sets of points

Let C be a curve of genus g, embedded in [formula] by a complete linear system of degree d = g + r for some r  ≥  g + 2. Then deg (C)  ≥  2g + 2 and C satisfies (N1), i.e., the homogeneous ideal of C is generated by quadrics. Note that C imposes [formula] conditions on quadrics.

In the situation of ([\ref=thm13]), C is uniquely determined as the intersection of the quadrics containing Γ, since Γ consists of n  ≥  2r + 3 + 2g = 2d + 3 > 2d points.

In the situation of ([\ref=thm14]), the same holds for general Γ, because the residual divisor for a quadric through n general points on C consists of a section of a line bundle of degree 2d - n  ≤  g - 5 < g, and the general such line bundle has only the zero section.

As F(n,g) is injective at Γ under our assumptions, it suffices to show that the induced map on Zariski tangent spaces is an isomorphism. We will use the following local criterion:

Let C be a curve of genus g = α, embedded into [formula] by a non-special complete linear system. Assume that C satisfies (N1). Let [formula] with [formula] and set [formula]. The following conditions are equivalent:

F(n,g) induces a bijective map on Zariski tangent spaces in Γ.

The multiplication map [formula] is surjective.

The Zariski tangent space of H(n,g) has a filtration with two components, namely H0NΓ  /  C representing deformations of Γ in C, and [formula] representing deformations of C in [formula].

P(n,g) is a determinantal variety, and its Zariski tangent space at Γ is obtained by pullback from the generic determinantal variety [formula] (see [\cite=ACGH]). The Zariski tangent space at A∈Mk - Mk - 1 is [formula].

In our case, [formula], [formula], [formula]. Therefore

Now consider the following diagram: The first map in the bottom line is injective: [formula], because Γ determines C, hence no non-trivial deformation of C can fix Γ.

[formula], because C is embedded by a nonspecial linear system, hence C is unobstructed.

H0NΓ / C classifies deformations of Γ inside C. This vector space lies in the Zariski tangent space of P(n,g) at Γ, and we obtain a map

[formula] classifies deformations of C in [formula]. As the deformed curve lies on the same number of quadrics, this vector space also lies in the Zariski tangent space of P(n,g) at Γ.

We obtain: C deforms with Γ if and only if the map is injective.

We identify [formula] and [formula], and dualize f: Applying Serre duality, we find a map which is the composition

[formula]

C deforms with Γ if and only if [formula] is surjective.

Let L be a very ample line bundle on a curve C and assume that the ideal sheaf of C is generated by quadrics. There is an exact sequence

[formula]

On C  ×  C  ×  C, we have the following diagram with exact rows and columns

[formula]

Tensoring with pr*3L and applying (pr1,2)*, we obtain a diagram on C  ×  C

[formula]

Applying (pr1)* to the second exterior power of the top horizontal sequence, we find that [formula] injects into [formula]. However, [formula] has no global sections, hence [formula].

Considering next (pr1)* of the left vertical sequence, we find a monomorphism [formula].

We now tensor diagram ([\ref=diag2]) with [formula], apply (pr1)* and divide the four direct image sheaves in the top left square by the image of [formula].

The middle horizontal row of the resulting diagram appears as the bottom row of the following diagram We find that [formula] (defined here as a push-down) is part of the filtration of [formula], induced by taking second symmetric powers of For the full filtration, see the middle row of the next commutative diagram

[formula]

The left vertical sequence thus is the middle vertical sequence of the desired result diagram, and we obtain

[formula]

The sequence from our proposition arises from the top row, taking into account the exact sequence used to construct PL.

Finally, we need to show that the map [formula] is induced by the canonical map [formula]. This can be done by a direct calculation, or as follows:

Note that diagram ([\ref=diag2]) above can alternatively be obtained as pullback of a similar diagram that lives on the blow-up of [formula] in the diagonal.

Now given an arbitrary quadric Q containing C, pulling the diagram back to the blow-up of Q  ×  Q in its diagonal, and taking the appropriate direct images, we obtain the top map of the following diagram

[formula]

The commutativity of diagram ([\ref=diag4]) now provides the desired identification of the map.

Conclusion of the proof

[formula] is surjective, if one of the following conditions holds:

g = 0, d =  deg (C)  ≥  1, deg B  ≥  1;

g = 1, d  ≥  4, deg B  ≥  3;

g  ≥  2, d  =  2g + 2, deg B  ≥  2g + 3;

g  ≥  2, d  ≥  2g + 3, deg B  ≥  2g + 1.

By ([\ref=prop22]) it suffices to show that [formula] for [formula] where [formula]. If we knew that the higher direct images [formula] and [formula] both vanish, then Leray's spectral sequence implies that [formula], and the latter vanishes by ([\ref=thm32]) resp. ([\ref=rmk33]) below.

To compute the higher direct images, we note that [formula], because L is non-special and very ample, hence [formula], and [formula].

Now consider the left vertical sequence of diagram ([\ref=diag2]) in the proof of ([\ref=prop22]). After tensoring with [formula] and applying (pr1)*, we find that the stalks of [formula] sit in the exact sequence

[formula]

ML,x can be canonically identified with H0L( - x), and f with the multiplication map [formula]. The assumption on d implies that f is surjective and that the right term vanishes for every x∈C, therefore [formula].

The line bundle [formula] has degree 2g - 2 + n - 2d = n - 2r - 2 which is at least 2g + 1 (for g  ≤  r - 3) resp. 2g + 3 (for g = r - 2), therefore the theorem follows from ([\ref=prop21]) and ([\ref=thm31]).

[formula] is a general line bundle of degree 2g - 2 + n - 2d  ≥  g + 3, and, going back to the proofs of ([\ref=thm13]) and ([\ref=thm31]), it suffices to show that [formula]. But that result will be shown as ([\ref=eq1]) in the proof of ([\ref=thm32]) below.

Let C be a curve of genus g, let L1, L2 and L3 be line bundles on C with deg L1  ≥  2g + 1, deg L2  ≥  2g + 2, deg L3  ≥  2g + 3. Then

Choose a line bundle L'3 of degree g + 3 with the following properties:

L'3 is very ample and non-special,

[formula] for general p∈C,

[formula],

[formula].

Each of them separately holds on a Zariski-open subset of the Picard variety of line bundles of degree g + 3, as long as [formula] and [formula].

Since [formula], we have [formula]. If the divisor of the corresponding section consists of pairwise distinct points, we have a short exact sequence

[formula]

in the general case, we will still have a short exact sequence starting with the two terms above. However, the term on the right may not split as a direct sum, but instead have a filtration with graded pieces [formula].

Now ([\ref=thm32]) will follow from

It is well-known that ([\ref=eq2]) holds, if deg L1( - pi)  ≥  2g and deg L2( - pi)  ≥  2g + 1; i.e., if deg L1  ≥  2g + 1 and deg L2  ≥  2g + 2.

Since L'3 is very ample and non-special, H1L'3( - x1 - x2)  =  0 for all (x1,x2)∈C  ×  C; hence [formula]. Denoting [formula], Leray's spectral sequence reduces ([\ref=eq1]) to

[formula]

In the next step, apply (pr1,2)* to

[formula]

to obtain a sequence Its second exterior power is Since M2,L'3 is a vector bundle of rank H0L'3( - x - y) = 2, [formula] is a line bundle, we calculate and ([\ref=eq3]) will now follow from

Now (iii) and (iv) together imply ([\ref=eq4]), while ([\ref=eq5]) follows from Leray's spectral sequence, since (ii) above implies that [formula] is supported in a (possibly empty) set of points.

For curves of genus g  ≤  1, some of the arguments in the above proof can be improved:

For elliptic curves, any line bundle L'3 of degree 3 is very ample and gives a plane embedding. Hence the vanishing result of ([\ref=thm32]) holds for line bundles L1, L2, L3, as soon as deg L1  ≥  3, deg L2  ≥  4 and deg L3  ≥  4. Therefore ([\ref=thm13]) even holds for α = 1, r = 3, in line with Eisenbud and Harris' result.

For rational curves, we have the vanishing for deg L1  ≥  1, deg L2  ≥  1 and deg L3  ≥  1, hence ([\ref=thm13]) is also valid for α = 0, r = 2 in line with Castelnuovo's result.

The bounds in ([\ref=thm31]) and ([\ref=thm32]) are sharp, as can be seen from the following

Let C be a hyperelliptic curve of genus g  ≥  2.

(deg L1  =   deg L2 = 2g + 1, arbitrary L3) Embed C by a line bundle L of degree 2g + 1. Then [formula] is not surjective.

(deg L1  =   deg L2  =   deg L3 = 2g + 2) Embed C by a line bundle L of degree 2g + 2. Then [formula] is not surjective.

1. Since C is hyperelliptic, its image in [formula] lies on a rational normal scroll S of degree g [\cite=EisHar]. Any quadric not containing S will intersect S in a divisor of degree 2g, hence cannot contain C.

2. According to the exact sequence it suffices to show that [formula]. As [formula], the exact sequence on C and Leray's spectral sequence show that Filtering L as in the proof of ([\ref=thm32]), we find that this cohomology group surjects onto [formula] which is non-trivial for hyperelliptic C [\cite=Laz].

On linear normality, and two applications

About the assumption of linear normality

Recall the setup in which we are working:

[formula] is a nondegenerate reduced irreducible curve of degree n and genus g > πα(n,r) for some α  ≤  r. [formula] is a curve of degree ≤  r - 1 + α containing a general hyperplane section Γ of X.

Our results in sections 2 and 3 apply to linearly normal curves C whose ideal sheaf is generated by quadrics.

We would like to point out:

Even if X is linearly normal, C may not have this property; e.g., let C0 be a curve of genus g  ≥  1, let D be a line of degree 2g + k, let [formula], embedded into [formula] by the line bundle [formula] as a surface of degree 4g + 2k, and let X be the intersection of S with a hypersurface of large degree; here α = 2g + 1 and [formula].

The intersection of the quadrics containing Γ may have dimension 2; let k = 1 and let C0 be hyperelliptic in the previous example; the ideal sheaves of S and its hyperplane section C are generated by quadrics and cubics.

A criterion for a curve to be locally an intersection of quadrics

Let L be a very ample line bundle of degree [formula] defining an embedding [formula]. Green and Lazarsfeld have shown that C is scheme-theoretically cut out by quadrics unless it has a tri-secant line. Their proof is outlined in [\cite=Laz].

We would like to offer an alternative proof, starting with

Let L be a very ample line bundle on a curve C which embeds C as a quadratically normal curve, x∈C. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

C is scheme-theoretically cut out by quadrics at x.

The line bundle L( - x) is very ample (i.e., C has no trisecant line through x) and embeds C as a quadratically normal curve.

Consider the diagram ([\ref=diag3]) in the proof of ([\ref=thm32]). Note first that the two bottom rows of the diagram exist for an arbitrary variety and are exact. Quadratic normality implies the surjectivity of the vertical map in the middle (compare diagram ([\ref=diag2a])), and we identified the kernels of the vertical maps, hence the snake lemma yields an exact sequence Since the map S2ML,x  →  RL2,x can be identified with S2H0L( - x)  →  H0L2( - 2x), this implies the equivalence of the two conditions.

Green and Lazarsfeld's result is now an immediate consequence of their earlier result that the embedding by a very ample line bundle of degree [formula] is quadratically normal [\cite=GL].

Cohomology of the square of the ideal sheaf

Our results permit to answer a question, posed independently by A. Bertram and J. Wahl:

Let [formula] be a curve of genus g, embedded by a complete linear system of degree d  ≥  2g + 3. Then [formula].

It suffices to show that [formula] is surjective. But by ([\ref=thm31]), the map [formula] is surjective, and it factors through [formula].

([\ref=ex34]) shows that the vanishing fails for hyperelliptic curves embedded by a line bundle of degree 2g + 2, hence our result is the best possible without further assumptions on C.

Wahl is particularly interested in the canonical embedding [\cite=Wahl]. He shows that the vanishing of [formula] holds for the general canonical curve of genus g  ≥  3, but fails for curves with [formula].

The picture for canonical curves is almost completed by recent work of Arbarello, Bruno and Sernesi [\cite=ABS] who show that [formula] vanishes for all curves of genus g  ≥  8 and [formula].

A natural generalization of ([\ref=prop42]) in the spirit of [\cite=GL] would be the following

Let [formula] be a curve of genus g, embedded by a complete linear system |L| of degree d, and suppose that h1L  ≤  1. If [formula], then [formula].
