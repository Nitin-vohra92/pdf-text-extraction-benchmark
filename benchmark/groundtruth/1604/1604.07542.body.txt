Property

Ramanujan-Fourier series of certain arithmetic functions of two variables

Introduction

Let cq(n) denote the Ramanujan sums defined in [\cite=Ramanujan] as

[formula]

where q and n are positive integers and (a,q) is the greatest common divisor of a and q. Ramanujan proved that cq(n) can be rewritten as

[formula]

where μ is the M[formula]bius function. Hardy [\cite=Hardy] proved that, for fixed n, cq(n) is a multiplicative function. In other words,

[formula]

holds for any [formula] satisfying (q1,q2) = 1. Let [formula] be an arithmetic function. Ramanujan [\cite=Ramanujan] investigated its Ramanujan-Fourier series which is an infinite series of the form

[formula]

where aq are called the Ramanujan-Fourier coefficients of f, and he obtained the following results.

[formula]

where [formula] with s > 0,  ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function,  φ(n) is Euler's totient function,  [formula],  τ(n) is the number of divisors of n and r(n) is the number of representations of n as the sum of two squares.

Let *   denotes the Dirichlet convolution, that is, [formula] for arithmetic functions f,g, and let ω(n) be the number of distinct prime divisors of n. We say that [formula] is a multiplicative function if f satisfies f(mn) = f(m)f(n) for any [formula] satisfying (m,n) = 1.

Delange [\cite=Delange] proved the following theorem.

Let f(n) be an arithmetic function satisfying

[formula]

Then its Ramanujan-Fourier series is pointwise convergent and

[formula]

holds where

[formula]

Moreover, if f is a multiplicative function, then aq can be rewritten as

[formula]

where P is the set of prime numbers and [formula]

Delange noted that, if f is a multiplicative function, then the condition ([\ref=eq:Del-1]) is equivalent to the condition: [formula] since (f * μ)(pe) = f(pe) - f(pe - 1) for [formula]. Under this condition, we can directly calculate Ramanujan-Fourier coefficients aq for certain arithmetic functions by using ([\ref=eq:Del-2]). For example, if we set f(n) = φ(n) / n, then we can easily calculate the right-hand side of ([\ref=eq:Del-2]) and obtain aq = (ζ(2))- 1μ(q)  /  φ2(q) which coincide with the Ramanujan-Fourier coefficients of ([\ref=eq:varphi]).

Many results concerning Ramanujan-Fourier series of arithmetic functions of one variable are obtained by many mathematicians hitherto, however, as for Ramanujan-Fourier series of arithmetic functions of two variables, to my knowledge, few results are known. We would like to extend Delange's theorem to the case of functions of two variables and obtain several examples which are extensions of ([\ref=eq:sigma]) ~   ([\ref=eq:r]).

Some Results

Let f, [formula] be arithmeric functions of two variables. The Dirichlet convolution of f and g is defined as follows.

[formula]

We use the same notation μ for the function

[formula]

which is the inverse of the constant function 1 under the Dirichlet convolution, that is, (μ  *  1)(n1,n2) = δ(n1,n2) holds where δ(n1,n2) = 1 or 0 according to whether n1 = n2 = 1 or not.

We investigate Ramanujan-Fourier series of arithmetical functions of two variables along Delange's article ([\cite=Delange]). We first establish the following theorem which is an extension of Theorem [\ref=th:Delange] to the case of arithmetic functions of two variables.

Let f(n1,n2) be an arithmetic function of two variables satisfying

[formula]

Then its Ramanujan-Fourier series is pointwise convergent and

[formula]

holds where

[formula]

For the proof of the above theorem, we need the following lemma.

For every positive integer k,

[formula]

We proceed as in [\cite=Delange]. We first note that ([\ref=eq:th2-1-1]) implies the absolute convergence of the right-hand side of ([\ref=eq:th2-1-a]). Next we show that the series [formula] is absolutely convergent. It is easy to see that

[formula]

where

[formula]

By ([\ref=eq:th2-1-1]) and Lemma [\ref=lem:Del] we have

[formula]

Hence the series [formula] is absolutely convergent. We have

[formula]

where

[formula]

Using the well known formula: [formula] where [formula] ([\cite=Sivaramakrishnan]), we have

[formula]

Therefore ([\ref=eq:th2-1-2]) holds. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:th2-1].

We say that [formula] is a multiplicative function of two variables if f satisfies

[formula]

for any [formula] satisfying (m1m2, n1n2) = 1. It is well known that if f and g are multiplicative functions of two variables, then f * g also becomes a multiplicative function of two variables. For an arithmetical function f of two variable, the mean value M(f) is defined by

[formula]

if this limit exists. Ushiroya [\cite=Ushiroya1] proved the following theorem.

Let f be a multiplicative function of two variables satisfying

[formula]

Then the mean value M(f) exists and

[formula]

We would like to investigate Ramanujan-Fourier series in the case when f is a multiplicative function of two variables. The following theorem is an extension of Theorem [\ref=th:Delange] to the case of a multiplicative function of two variables.

Let f be a multiplicative function of two variables satisfying

[formula]

Then its Ramanujan-Fourier series is pointwise convergent and

[formula]

holds where

[formula]

Moreover, if M(f)  ≠  0 and {q1,q2} > 1, where {q1,q2} denotes the least common multiple of q1 and q2 , then aq1,q2 can be rewritten as follows.

[formula]

By ([\ref=eq:th_u]) and ([\ref=eq:th2-4-a]), we have a1,1 = M(f).

First we note that, if f(n1,n2) is a multiplicative function of two variables, then [formula] holds. Let f satisfy ([\ref=eq:th2_4_ass1]). Since (n1,n2)  ↦  2ω(n1)2ω(n2)|(f * μ)(n1,n2)|  /  n1n2 is a multiplicative function of two variables, we have

[formula]

where we have used the well-known inequality [formula] for [formula]. Since f satisfies ([\ref=eq:th2-1-1]), we see by Theorem [\ref=th:th2-1] that the Ramanujan-Fourier series of f is pointwise convergent and ([\ref=eq:th2-4-1]) holds.

Next we prove ([\ref=eq:th2-4-2]) under the condition M(f)  ≠  0 and {q1,q2} > 1. For i = 1,2, let [formula] [formula] and [formula] [formula] be the prime factor decompositions of qi and mi respectively where pj's are prime numbers satisfying pj|{q1,q2} and ri's are positive integers coprime to q1q2. Then we have

[formula]

Since f * μ is multiplicative, we have

[formula]

Since the condition M(f)  ≠  0 implies [formula] for every p∈P by ([\ref=eq:th_u]), we have

[formula]

This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:th2-4].

Examples

In this section, we give several examples. We begin with the following example.

Let f(n1,n2) = φ(n1n2)  /  n1n2. Then its Ramanujan-Fourier series is pointwise convergent and

[formula]

holds where [formula] and [formula]

First we show that f satisfies ([\ref=eq:th2_4_ass1]). If we set [formula], then g(pe) = 1 - 1 / p for [formula]. From this we have for [formula]

[formula]

From the above and ([\ref=eq:th_u]) we can calculate the mean value M(f) as follows.

[formula]

Since M(f)  ≠  0, we have by ([\ref=eq:th2-4-2])

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

holds if [formula] where [formula]. Since the function (q1,q2)  ↦  aq1,q2  /  M(f) is multiplicative, ([\ref=eq:ex3-1-2]) holds for every [formula]. This completes the proof of Example [\ref=ex:3-1].

The formula ([\ref=eq:varphi]) says that, if we set f(n) = φ(n)  /  n, then [formula] holds since M(f) = 6 / π2 in this case. However, Example [\ref=ex:3-1] shows that the function f(n1,n2) = φ(n1n2)  /  n1n2 does not have a similar expression of Ramanujan-Fourier series to that of ([\ref=eq:varphi]). We want to find an arithmetic function f which satisfies [formula]. In the following example, we give a function which satisfies the above relation.

Let f(n1,n2) be the multiplicative function defined by

[formula]

Then its Ramanujan-Fourier series is pointwise convergent and

[formula]

holds where

[formula]

By ([\ref=eq:ex3-2-1]) it follows that

[formula]

From the above it is obvious that f satisfies ([\ref=eq:th2_4_ass1]). Hence its Ramanujan-Fourier series is pointwise convergent by Theorem [\ref=th:th2-4]. Using ([\ref=eq:th_u]) and ([\ref=eq:ex2-5-1]) we have

[formula]

As for the Ramanujan-Fourier coefficients of f, we have by ([\ref=eq:th2-4-2]) and ([\ref=eq:ex2-5-1])

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

holds if [formula] where [formula]. Since the function (q1,q2)  ↦  aq1,q2  /  M(f) is multiplicative, ([\ref=eq:ex3-2-2]) holds for every [formula]. This completes the proof of Example [\ref=ex:3-2].

Next we consider the case in which f(n1,n2) is defined by f(n1,n2) = g((n1,n2)) where [formula] is a multiplicative function. Before describing Ramanujan-Fourier series of this case, we would like to cite the following theorem.

Let f(n1,n2) = g((n1,n2)) where g is a multiplicative function satisfying

[formula]

Then the mean value M(f) exists and

[formula]

We note that, if f(n1,n2) = g((n1,n2)), then it is easy to see that

[formula]

Hence ([\ref=eq:th3-1]) clearly implies ([\ref=eq:th2_4_ass1]).

Now we can show the following theorem concerning Ramanujan-Fourier series in the case f(n1,n2) = g((n1,n2)). Let [formula] denote [formula]

Let f(n1,n2) = g((n1,n2)) where g is a multiplicative function satisfying

[formula]

Then its Ramanujan-Fourier series is pointwise convergent and

[formula]

holds where a1,1 = M(f) and

[formula]

for q1,q2 such that {q1,q2} > 1.

Remark [\ref=re:rem3-4] says that ([\ref=eq:th3-2-1]) implies ([\ref=eq:th2_4_ass1]). It is easy to see that ([\ref=eq:th3-2-2]) holds by ([\ref=eq:th2-4-2]) and ([\ref=eq:rem3-4]). This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=th:3-4].

The following example is an extension of ([\ref=eq:sigma]) to the case f(n1,n2) = g((n1,n2)).

Let f(n1,n2) = σs((n1,n2))  /  (n1,n2)s where s >  - 1. Then its Ramanujan-Fourier series is pointwise convergent and

[formula]

If we set g(n) = σs(n)  /  ns, then we see that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Therefore ([\ref=eq:th3-1]) holds and we have by ([\ref=eq:th3-3-M])

[formula]

For k and [formula] satisfying [formula] we also have by ([\ref=eq:th3-2-2])

[formula]

Therefore [formula] holds if [formula]. Since the function (q1,q2)  ↦  aq1,q2 / M(f) is multiplicative, we obtain the desired result.

If we set s = 0 in Example [\ref=ex:sigma_s], then we obtain the following example.

Let f(n1,n2) = τ((n1,n2)) where τ(n) is the number of divisors of n. Then its Ramanujan-Fourier series is pointwise convergent and

[formula]

The following example is an extension of ([\ref=eq:varphi]) to the case f(n1,n2) = g((n1,n2)).

Let f(n1,n2) = φ((n1,n2))  /  (n1,n2). Then its Ramanujan-Fourier series is pointwise convergent and

[formula]

If we set g(n) = φ(n)  /  n, then g(pe) = 1 - 1 / p for [formula]. Hence ([\ref=eq:th3-1]) holds and we have by ([\ref=eq:th3-3-M])

[formula]

We also have by ([\ref=eq:th3-2-2])

[formula]

and

[formula]

Therefore aq1,q2 = M(f)μ({q1,q2}) / φ3({q1,q2}) holds if [formula]. Since the function (q1,q2)  ↦  aq1,q2 / M(f) is multiplicative, we obtain the desired result.

The proof of the following example is similar to that of the previous example.

Let f(n1,n2) = φs((n1,n2))  /  (n1,n2)s where s >  - 1. Then its Ramanujan-Fourier series is pointwise convergent and

[formula]

If we set s = 0 in Example [\ref=ex:varphi_s], then we obtain the following example.

Let [formula] Then its Ramanujan-Fourier series is pointwise convergent and

[formula]

The following example is an extension of ([\ref=eq:r]) to the case f(n1,n2) = g((n1,n2)).

Let [formula] where [formula] Then its Ramanujan-Fourier series is pointwise convergent and

[formula]

where [formula] and  [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula]. Then g(2e) = 1 and

[formula]

From this we have g(2e) - g(2e - 1) = 0 and

[formula]

Hence ([\ref=eq:th3-1]) clearly holds. Furthermore, we have for [formula]

[formula]

Using ([\ref=eq:th3-3-M]) and([\ref=eq:ex3-10-1]) we can calculate the mean value M(f) as follows.

[formula]

Let [formula] be non-negative integers satisfying [formula]. Using ([\ref=eq:th3-2-2]) and ([\ref=eq:ex3-10-1]) we obtain

[formula]

Therefore aq1,q2 = M(f)χ({q1,q2})  /  {q1,q2}2 holds if [formula] where p∈P. Since the function (q1,q2)  ↦  aq1,q2 / M(f) is multiplicative, we obtain the desired result. This completes the proof of Example [\ref=ex:ex3-10].
