Heat Kernel estimates for general boundary problems

Introduction

Let U be an open set in [formula] ([formula]) and consider the Dirichlet Laplace operator ΔD on L2(U). Then the fundamental solution K(t),  t  ≥  0 of the heat equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions can be constructed via spectral calculus as

[formula]

The integral kernel KD(x,y;t) of KD(t) defined by

[formula]

is a positive smooth function on [formula]. It describes the propagation of heat from the point x to the point y in time t. In case [formula] the heat kernel is explicitly given by

[formula]

On physical grounds one expects that for small times the heat kernel is dominated by local contributions that do not involve the boundary of U. This is essentially the principle of not feeling the boundary by Kac ([\cite=Kac]). Both qualitative and explicit quantitative versions of this principle have been obtained by some authors ([\cite=Berg1] [\cite=Berg2] [\cite=Hunt]) by exploiting the probabilistic interpretation of the heat kernel ([\cite=Ray54] [\cite=Rosenblatt] [\cite=Simon]). The best estimate for the Dirichlet Laplacian we are aware of was obtained in [\cite=Berg2] and reads

[formula]

Here δ is the distance of the convex hull of {x,y} to the boundary ∂U of U. It is also known (see e.g. [\cite=Berg2] [\cite=Hsu]) that

[formula]

where ρ(x) is the distance of x to ∂U. These estimates show that as t goes to 0 the error in approximating the heat kernel by K0(x,y;t) is exponentially small with decay rate determined by the distance to the boundary.

Explicit estimates like these are important in spectral geometry and mathematical physics. For example the meromorphic extension of the local spectral zeta function is usually based on the expansion of the heat kernel ([\cite=Gilkey]). The above estimates directly lead to bounds on the local spectral zeta functions or other spectral invariants ([\cite=Elizalde]). A particular example of such a local spectral function is the Casimir energy density that plays a distinguished role in physics. For these applications it is important to allow for boundary conditions other than Dirichlet. For example Casimir interaction between two conducting obstacles is described by the Casimir energy density of the photon field. This is obtained from the Laplace operator acting on one forms with relative boundary conditions. To be able to deal with Laplace operators of such type one needs to consider self-adjoint extensions of the vector-valued Laplace operator on domains that are not simply sums of Laplace operator on functions. In order to illustrate this let us discuss briefly the example of the propagation of electromagnetic waves, or in a quantum field theoretic description the propagation of a photon. To keep things simple assume that U is either [formula], where [formula] is a compact subset with smooth boundary, or a bounded domain with smooth boundary. If the boundary is modelled as a perfect conductor then separation of variables in the wave equation results in the Laplace operator acting on [formula]-valued functions and the following boundary conditions for the electromagnetic vector potential [formula] of the form

[formula]

for all x∈∂U. Here [formula] is the outward pointing unit-vector-field on the boundary ∂U of U. These boundary conditions define a self-adjoint extension of the Laplace operator acting on [formula]-valued smooth compactly supported functions. This self-adjoint extension is however not simply a sum of operators acting on function, as the boundary conditions are different for the different components. In fact, the wave group as well as the heat semi-group will in general mix the components of the vector they are acting on. In physics this corresponds to the fact that mirrors change the polarization of light. We would like to refer the reader to [\cite=Bordag] for further details and references on Casimir energy density computations.

The aim of this note is to show that explicit not feeling the boundary estimates can be obtained for any self-adjoint extension of the Laplace operator acting on vector-valued functions on a domain. They can be derived from a combination of finite propagation speed estimates and explicit Fourier Tauberian theorems that were found by Safarov in [\cite=Safarov]. The idea of using finite propagation speed estimates in this context is not new and is already present in the classical paper [\cite=Cheeger]. It has since been used by many authors to derive heat kernel bounds on manifolds (see e.g. [\cite=Coulhon] [\cite=Dodziuk] [\cite=LS] [\cite=PV] [\cite=Sikora]). The combination with the estimates of the spectral function obtained via Fourier Tauberian arguments gives bounds that in some regimes are better than the known estimates for the Dirichlet heat kernel. The implied constants are independent of the boundary conditions.

To describe the main result let us assume that, as before, U is an open set in [formula] and denote by ρ(x) the distance from x∈U to the boundary of U. Let N be a positive integer. Consider in the Hilbert space [formula] an arbitrary non-negative self-adjoint extension ΔU of the Laplacian

[formula]

acting component-wise. The heat kernel for ΔU, denoted by

[formula]

is the integral kernel of e- tΔU,  t > 0 defined by the functional calculus of self-adjoint operators. When [formula] the counterpart for ΔU and [formula] is denoted respectively by Δ0 and [formula]. Of course,

[formula]

There exist two positive constants C1,C2 depending only d such that if [formula] then

[formula]

Here ρ(x,y) =  min (ρ(x),ρ(y)).

The constants C1,C2 can be explicitly given, but we refer the reader to the relevant section of this paper for the full description. As a corollary, we are able to answer a question raised in [\cite=Lacey] about an upper estimate for the Neumann heat kernel.

Vector-valued Laplacians

Throughout we fix some notations: Let [formula] with [formula]. Let V denote either U or 0. Let [formula] denote the (distributional) integral kernel of the operator (1 + ΔV)- m. If N = 1 we also write G(m)V for [formula]. By (local) elliptic regularity [formula] is continuous on the open set U  ×  U. For any R > 0 define

[formula]

where AR is the set of real-valued functions ψ in [formula] such that [formula], and

[formula]

Any matrix of size N  ×  N can be naturally regarded as a linear operator on the Hilbert space [formula], so we let [formula] denote its operator norm.

Finite propagation speed

Before we start let us make some notational remarks. Let x,y∈U, [formula]. We denote [formula], where δx is the Dirac delta distribution at x. Strictly speaking, [formula] is not in the domain of the self-adjoint operators e- tΔV and [formula]. We understand however expressions such as [formula] as distributions (in x) with values in the Hilbert space [formula]. Pairing with the test function φ∈C∞c(U) is defined as [formula]. As usual, the expression [formula] is then understood as a distribution with values in [formula] With this notation the distributional integral kernel [formula] of an operator K is [formula]. In particular, expressions of the form 〈δ(v)x,Kδ(w)y〉 are bi-distributions and the pairing with test functions [formula] is given by [formula].

Alternatively, one can also understand [formula] as the distributional limit of a sequence [formula], where φn is a δ-family centered at x. Note that [formula] is formally self-adjoint, and a continuous map from [formula] to [formula]. This follows from (local) elliptic regularity because [formula] is a continuous map from C∞0(U)  →  L2(U) for any [formula]. It therefore extends by duality to a continuous map from [formula] to [formula]. As usual, here [formula] denotes the space of distributions with values in [formula], and [formula] denotes the subspace of distributions of compact support.

The following pointwise estimate holds for the heat kernel:

[formula]

Let ψ∈AR where R = ρ(x) + ρ(y). It is well-known (see e.g. [\cite=Taylor]) that

[formula]

Finite propagation speed for the wave equation implies that if |s1| < ρ(x) then [formula] has compact support in U and agrees with [formula]. Note that any [formula] with |s| < ρ(x) + ρ(y) can be written as s = s1 + s2 with |s1| < ρ(x), |s2| < ρ(y), [formula]. With this decomposition available and by considering

[formula]

as well as |s1 - s2| <  max {ρ(x),ρ(y)}, 0 <  min {ρ(x),ρ(y)}, one obtains

[formula]

for any [formula] with |s| < ρ(x) + ρ(y). As [formula], we get

[formula]

for any [formula]. On the other hand, note that

[formula]

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality several times this gives

[formula]

for any [formula]. Combining ([\ref=222]), ([\ref=223]), ([\ref=29]) with ([\ref=221]) suffices to conclude the proof.

Safarov's estimate

Since ΔU is a non-negative self-adjoint operator, by the spectral theorem

[formula]

where Π(λ) ([formula]) denotes the spectral projection of ΔU onto the interval

[formula]

(x,x) = d(x,x;λ).

[formula]

Optimizing cut-off functions

This section is devoted to proving Theorem [\ref=Theorem11]. To this end it suffices to bound Jm(R;t) for R = ρ(x) + ρ(y). In general we suppose R > 0. The Hermite polynomials

[formula]

can be written as

[formula]

from which it is easy to deduce that

[formula]

Consequently, by Leibniz's rule one gets for any non-negative integer [formula] that

[formula]

To optimize the choice of cutoff functions we first let ψ0 denote a fixed real-valued function in [formula] such that ψ0(s) = 0 for [formula] and ψ0(s) = 1 for [formula]. Later on we will give concrete examples of ψ0 and thus

[formula]

can be explicitly determined. Then for any 0 < ε1  <  ε2 < R define

[formula]

which is an even function in [formula] with [formula]. We let the parameters ε1,ε2 (depending on both R and t) behave in the following way:

ε2  →  R,

[formula].

With the help of Lemma [\ref=lemma24], it is not hard to show that if [formula], then

[formula]

where Z(n,ψ0,R;t) is short for the rational function

[formula]

In general, it follows straightforward from Leibniz's rule and ([\ref=basic]) that

Suppose [formula]. Then

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=Theorem11] is an immediate consequence of Theorems [\ref=Theorem22], [\ref=Theoremop] with [formula].

If β is a non-negative integer and if [formula], then

[formula]

Note first

[formula]

where Γ(  ·  ,  ·  ) is the upper incomplete Gamma function. If [formula] is a positive integer then it is known that [formula] for all r > 0. This partially proves the lemma simply by considering [formula]. If [formula] is a positive half-integer then we can use [formula] and the previous explicit formula for [formula] to prove the remaining part of the lemma. This finishes the proof.

Although there are many test functions for ψ0, we use an interpolating polynomial because Mj(ψ0) can be determined rather easily. For any [formula], there exists a unique polynomial Pn of degree ≤  2n + 1 such that Pn(0) = 0, Pn(1) = 1, and

[formula]

We then define a function [formula] on [formula] such that it agrees with Pn on

[formula]

Dirichlet boundary conditions

We denote by K(D)U(x,y;t) the Dirichlet heat kernel for an open set [formula]. Michiel van den Berg's ([\ref=BestBerg]) gives

[formula]

To compare, Theorem [\ref=Theorem11] is a slight improvement of ([\ref=formula32]) for the short-time diagonal elements of the Dirichlet heat kernel if [formula].

It is known that G(m)U(x,x)  ≤  G(m)0(x,x) for any x∈U, where G(m)U is interpreted in accordance with the choice that ΔU denotes the Dirichlet Laplacian on U. Thus it follows from Theorem [\ref=Theorem21] and ([\ref=29]) that

[formula]

We remark that two other estimates by Michiel van den Berg ([\cite=Berg1]) reading

[formula]

have been widely used in the study of short-time asymptotics of the heat trace (see e.g. [\cite=Berg87] [\cite=Berg88] [\cite=ST]) and some other related problems (see e.g. [\cite=Berg07]).

Neumann boundary conditions

Let K(N)U(x,y;t) denote the Neumann heat kernel for a smooth bounded open set [formula]. As an application of Theorem [\ref=Theorem11] (or Theorem [\ref=Theorem41] with [formula]), there exists a positive function g on U such that if [formula] then

[formula]

where [formula]. This answers a question raised by Lacey ([\cite=Lacey]) who conjectured that for the class of smooth bounded strictly star-shaped domains ([\ref=formula45]) holds for some [formula] as long as time t is sufficiently small. Lacey also asked to extend the main result in [\cite=Lacey] to unbounded domains, domains with non-smooth boundary, or more general boundary conditions. Because of Theorem [\ref=Theorem11] this is indeed doable for the diagonal element of the corresponding Neumann heat kernel.

In the rest of the section we also give a replacement of ([\ref=28]) for G(m)U(x,x) without using Safarov's estimate ([\ref=Safarov]). Here G(m)U is interpreted in accordance with the choice that ΔU denotes the Neumann Laplacian on U. This can be done by appealing to partial domain monotonicity of the Neumann heat kernel.

For simplicity we assume that [formula] is a smooth bounded open set. Note first (see e.g. [\cite=Borisov], [\cite=Davies])

[formula]

which means that we need instead to prepare suitable upper bounds for K(N)U(x,x;t). In contrast to the Dirichlet boundary problems, there does not exist a general domain monotonicity principle ([\cite=Bass]) claiming for any U2  ⊂  U1 that

[formula]

Even though, Kac's original idea ([\cite=Kac]) of comparing K(D)U(x,x;t) with K(D)Bx(x,x;t) where Bx is chosen here to be the ball in [formula] with center x and radius ρ(x), still works for the Neumann boundary problems. This is exactly a result by Kendall ([\cite=Kendall], see also [\cite=Pascu]; if U is convex then see [\cite=Chavel]) stating

[formula]

which combined with ([\ref=41]) yields

[formula]

Let [formula] denote the Neumann heat kernel for the d-dimensional unit ball. The Pascu-Gageonea resolution ([\cite=PG]) of the Laugesen-Morpurgo conjecture ([\cite=LM]) says that

[formula]

holds for all t > 0 and all x,y in the d-dimensional unit ball with |x| < |y|. This result implies that

[formula]

where Δ(N)d is short for the Neumann Laplacian on the d-dimensional unit ball.

Now let x∈U be fixed. It is straightforward to verify that

[formula]

Hence by considering ([\ref=43]), ([\ref=41]) with U replaced by Bx, ([\ref=formula46]) and ([\ref=45]), we get

[formula]

where in the last inequality we have used the fact [formula] for all [formula]. This estimate together with ([\ref=29]) gives from Theorem [\ref=Theorem21] the following

Let [formula] a smooth bounded open set and let [formula] with [formula]. For any t > 0 and any x,y in U one has

[formula]

where
