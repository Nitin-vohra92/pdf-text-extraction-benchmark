Galaxy cluster's rotation

Galaxy cluster's rotation

Introduction

Galaxy clusters are the deepest gravitational wells in the universe [\citep=well1] [\citep=well2], constituting an important ingredient of the Cosmic Web. They form at the interception of filaments and/or walls, where the galaxy density is larger and where infall is strongest [\citep=Rien08a] [\citep=Rien08b] [\citep=formationreview]. They contain from a few tens to a few thousands of galaxies. The frequency distribution of cluster masses, the mass function, and its evolution has been recognised as a very important cosmological probe that can constrain the current cosmological model [\citep=Borgani08] [\citep=masscosmology1] [\citep=masscosmology2]. Consequently, the accurate calculation of cluster masses is of uttermost importance and a powerful means to cosmological studies.

Many different approaches have been used to calculate cluster masses; taking advantage of clusters acting as gravitational lenses [\citep=Kneib08] [\citep=lensmass1] [\citep=lensmass2] [\citep=lensmass3], using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect [\citep=sz] [\citep=Birk08] [\citep=szmass2] [\citep=szmass1], assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and calculating the ICM temperature from their X-ray emission [\citep=Sarazin08] [\citep=hydromass1] [\citep=hydromass2] or using the clusters' galaxy members velocities and assuming dynamical equilibrium [\citep=dynmass1] [\citep=dynmass2] [\citep=dynmass3]. However, not all methods give the same results[\citep=Hoekstra07] [\citep=Peng09] [\citep=Donahue14]; each one of them has its own advantages and disadvantages [\citep=massmethods]. Comparing the different methods is important in order to understand the systematic effects that enter in each, and thus for estimating more accurately masses [\citep=calibr1] [\citep=calibr2] [\citep=calibr3].

When calculating the cluster mass using the velocities of the individual cluster members, we assume that the cluster is in virial equilibrium; the gravitational potential equals two times the sum of the kinetic energy of the members and that galaxy orbits are roughly isotropic. This does not take into account the possible contribution to the galaxy velocities of a rotational component. Clusters could be rotating due to an initial angular momentum that survives since their formation or due to recent mergers or interactions with close neighbours. Not taking into account the rotation could result in an erroneous dynamical cluster mass, which could ultimately affect the cosmological constraints provided by the cluster mass function. The difficulty to distinguish a rotating cluster from two closely interacting or merging ones is probably the cause for the few early attempts to investigate the rotation of galaxy clusters [\citep=mat] [\citep=Tov02]. [\citet=hwanglee] used the galaxy member velocities to search for indications of rotation and found ~  10% of their cluster sample to be rotating and in dynamical equilibrium (not undergoinng a recent merger). The relevant study of [\citet=ham] used galaxy velocities, X-ray spectra of intracluster gas and distortions of the CMB. [\citet=chlub] and [\citet=coo] studied the effect of the cluster rotation on the temperature and polarisation of the CMB; while other groups have attempted to model the rotation of the instracluster medium [\citep=fang] [\citep=bian]. A particular case study is cluster A2107 which has been found to rotate in multiple studies [\citep=mat] [\citep=oerg] [\citep=kal]. Recently, a new attempt to study cluster rotation using the SDSS spectroscopic sample concludes that some clusters are indeed rotating [\citep=tovm].

The current work aims in identifying the rotation of members of clusters by using their velocities taken from the SDSS DR10 spectroscopic database. We construct a novel algorithm that can identify both the cluster rotation axis and amplitude. We apply the algorithm to selected Abell clusters and seek for correlations between their rotation properties and their dynamical state. When required we use a flat ΛCDM cosmology with H0 = 70h70 km s- 1 Mpc- 1.

The paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we present our rotation identification algorithm and compare it with that of [\citet=hwanglee]. In section 3 we test the efficiency of our algorithm, while in section 4 we present our cluster sample, systematic biases and the application of our algorithm. In section 5 we present and discuss our results and we derive our conclusions in section 6.

Rotation identification

Our method of rotation identification

We introduce a method to identify the possible coherent rotation of galaxies in galaxy clusters. The method provides both the rotational velocity amplitude and the orientation of the projected rotation axis, as well as a quantification of the rotation being a true feature or an artifact.

Let us assume a cluster containing a certain number of galaxies. Each galaxy is characterized by the line-of-sight component of its velocity with respect to the cluster centre, ie, vlos = c  ×  (zgal - zcl), where zcl is the cluster redshift. The basic idea is to divide the projected cluster galaxy angular distribution in two semicircles (1 and 2), measure the difference of the mean galaxy velocities between the two semi-circles, vdif  =  〈v1〉  -  〈v2〉, and rotate consecutively the galaxy positions by an angle θ in the clockwise direction, repeating the measurements for each rotation. Consequently, we obtain the velocity difference vdif(θ) as a function of the angle θ. We will use the graph of vdif(θ), which we call rotation diagram, as our primary indication for the presence or not of a rotation mode. Of course an interesting issue, which we address in section 3.1, is related to the orientation of the rotational axis with respect to the line of sight which can hamper the detection of a rotational mode, if such exists.

A visual illustration of our approach is provided in figure [\ref=il], as explained below. For an ideally rotating cluster, the rotation diagram should show a clear periodic trend as a function of θ. For example, let us assume a counter rotating cluster a with rotational velocity amplitude of 600 km/s and a horizontal rotation axis ([formula]) on the plane of the sky. The ideal rotation in this case is imposed by assigning a constant rotational line-of-sight velocity to the galaxies: vlos =  - 300 km/s in the upper semicircle (with respect to the horizontal axis) and vlos = 300 km/s in the lower semicircle. Our procedure entails in rotating on the plane of the sky the galaxy-member positions by an angle θ starting from the vertical axis clockwise, in the range [formula] and with a step, say, of [formula]. For θ = 0, we will not observe any significant velocity difference; ideally, at the absence of noise we should obtain vdif = 0. As θ increases, the velocity difference should increase until it reaches its maximum value at [formula]. In this case, the galaxies in one semicircle would seem to move away and in the other semicircle would seem to approach us, with respect to the cluster centre. Then as θ increases to [formula] the amplitude of the rotation signal will decrease and increase again towards [formula] until it approaches again vdif = 0 at [formula]. The right panel of figure [\ref=il] shows the previously discussed behaviour of vdif(θ).

It is interesting to point-out that based on whether the troughs or the peaks appear first in our rotation diagram, we infer the rotating or counter-rotating nature of the cluster (as an example, in figure 1 the cluster is counter-rotating). In an initial irrotational Universe the expectation of course is for a statistically equivalent number of both type of rotating clusters.

If a non-rotating cluster has one or more subgroups with a significant velocity difference with respect to the rest of the cluster then, in the rotation diagram, we may observe peaks (or troughs) at some angle θ but not a significant periodicity. However, there are cases where global rotation and infalling substructures cannot be easily distinguished: (a) a subgroup occupying a relatively large fraction of the cluster projected area; (b) two significant subgroups of galaxies moving at opposite directions within the cluster potential, although such a case requires fine tunning and thus should be rare. In general, the expectations for a non-rotating cluster, with no significant infalling substructures, is expected to have a random rotation diagram (no systematic dependence of vdif(θ) on θ) with relatively small values of vdif(θ).

The method of Hwang & Lee

Another method to identify cluster rotation, with which we will compare our own, has been proposed by [\citet=hwanglee]. They use a sinusoidal relation to compute the angle of the rotation axis, Θo, and the rotational velocity vrot:

[formula]

where vp is the observed radial velocity of each galaxy, vsys is the peculiar velocity of the cluster and Θ is the projected on the plane of the sky position angle of each galaxy, setting off from North to East. Since in our case we use velocity differences with respect to the cluster mean recessional velocity, we set vsys = 0.

A χ2 minimization procedure can be used to determine the best fit values of Θo and vrot, assuming that the sinusoidal model of equation [\eqref=HL] represents well the velocity data. Namely, we use a grid of Θo and vrot values and calculate χ2 for each pair of parameters:

[formula]

where vlos,i is the line-of-sight velocity of every galaxy and σi its measurement error.

Validation of our method

Before applying our method to real galaxy cluster data, we should validate and confirm that it can provide unambiguously indications of rotation. To this end, we construct, using the Monte-Carlo simulation method, a virialised cluster with a mass of [formula], radius Rcl = 1 Mpc, core radius rc = 0.1 Mpc and having a King's profile density distribution

[formula]

where ρ(r) is the density included within radius r and ρ0 is the density in the centre of the cluster. To estimate the value of ρ0 we use the cluster mass Mcl,

[formula]

from which by using Mcl = M( < Rcl) and r = Rcl we estimate ρ0 = 6.56  ×  10- 12 kg/km3. Although it is known that the NFW [\citep=nfw] profile is a more accurate representation of the dark matter and galaxy density profiles in clusters of galaxies, while the King's profile is applicable mostly to the intracluster gas [\citep=king], it is acceptable to use the latter for the purpose of just testing our methodology. A realisation of one such Monte-Carlo cluster can be seen in figure [\ref=eg2].

Assuming that the cluster is dynamically relaxed (virialised) we can estimate, using the virial theorem, the amplitude of the expected 3-dimensional velocity, vk, of each galaxy, which depends on its distance from the cluster centre according to: v2k = GM(r) / 2r, and from equation [\eqref=Mass] we obtain:

[formula]

where M(r) is the mass within a sphere of radius r. Each Cartesian component vkx,vky,vkz of the virial velocity vk(r) is assumed to be randomly orientated. We can now assign to each galaxy a three dimensional velocity which could be: (a) the virial expectation, (b) a rotational velocity with its amplitude being a fraction of the virial expectation and a coherent orientation around a chosen axis, or (c) the vectorial sum of both.

From the components vx,vy,vz of the final velocity of each galaxy, we calculate its line-of-sight velocity from the relation:

[formula]

where φ is the vertical angle between the line of sight and axis x (see figure [\ref=los]). For φ = 0, the line of sight coincides with the x-axis; as the angle φ increases, we also take into account the z-component of the velocity in the line-of-sight velocity. For [formula], the line of sight coincides with the z-axis.

The cluster velocity dispersion, σv, will be estimated as usual according to:

[formula]

where n is the number of galaxy-members and vsys is the mean line-of-sight velocity of the cluster.

Simulating a realistic rotation in 3D

To simulate a realistic rotation profile of the cluster, we assign to each galaxy member the virial velocity that corresponds to its distance from the cluster centre with a random orientation. We also add vectorially a rotation velocity, the amplitude of which is a percentage (30%) of the virial one and which from equation [\eqref=above] we find it to be ~  928 km/s (at r = 1 Mpc), while its counterclockwise direction is set on the velocity components vrotx,vroty,vrotz, according to: The first relation ensures that the coordinate vector [formula] is perpendicular to the rotation velocity vector [formula]. The second implies that the z-component of the velocity is set 0, in order the rotational velocities to be perpendicular to the rotation axis z.

We wish to investigate the effect of different orientations of the 3-dimensional rotational axis with respect to the line-of-sight on the rotation identification by our method. In order not to mix the outcome of this test with issues related to sampling effects, we simulate a cluster with dense sampling (ie. having 1000 members). We set initially the rotation axis at a perpendicular position with respect to the line of sight and consequetively rotate the rotation axis with respect to the vertical position, so that it forms an angle φ with the line of sight in the interval ([formula]) until it is aligned with the line of sight.

We apply this procedure for two cases, an ideal where we assign only the corresponding rotational velocity to each mock galaxy, and a more realistic where we also vectorially add the corresponding randomly orientated virial velocity. The results for different values of the orientation of the rotation axis with respect to the line of sight are shown in figure [\ref=phir] for both methods, ours and that of [\citet=hwanglee]. The upper panels corresponds to the ideal case while the lower panels to the more realistic one.

As expected, the rotation signal becomes weaker (the rotation amplitude decreases) as the angle φ increases. The counter-rotating direction of rotation is apparent due to the occurrence of the peak at [formula] (ie., because [formula]). At [formula] the rotation cannot be identified, as the rotation component of the velocity of the galaxies is perpendicular to the line of sight and thus it cannot be observed. Our method gives a flat rotation diagram in this case, as it should, while the [\citet=hwanglee] method provides a "fake" signal with an amplitude of vrot  ~  200 km/sec. We also see that the rotation amplitude in the ideal positional case ([formula]) is accurately recovered by our method while it is underestimated by ~  35% when using the [\citet=hwanglee] method. Their method, as in the ideal 2D case which is presented later, appears to have problems in recovering the correct input rotation amplitude for any value of φ. Furthermore, the accuracy of the recovered rotation axis angle is quite good for both methods (it decreases slightly with increasing of φ). Similar results we recover also in the more realistic case (lower panels), with the addition that the rotation signal becomes practically undetectable for [formula].

Therefore, we conclude that we will miss a fraction of intriniscally rotating clusters due to axis orientation effects, even in the best case of dense sampling. If we make the reasonable assumption that the rotation axis of each cluster is randomly orientated with respect to the line of sight, the fraction of missed rotating clusters can be estimated as the ratio of the solid angle that corresponds to an angle [formula] to the solid angle of the whole sphere, ie.,

[formula]

This should be considered a strict lower limit to the expected number of missed rotating clusters, since sparser sampling will detariorate the detectability of rotation.

Simulation of the realistic rotation in 2D

We now investigate the systematics related to the realistic observational situation where we attempt to identify the cluster rotation on the plane of the sky. To this end, we project the 3D cluster on one plane, estimating the line-of-sight component of the total (virial and rotational) velocity of each mock galaxy and keeping its rotation axis perpendicular to the line of sight (φ = 0, which is the ideal case). We then apply our algorithm for different rotation axis orientations on the plane of the sky.

To study sampling effects in our cluster rotation identification procedure we simulate two cases; a cluster with 1000 and a cluster with 50 galaxies with the corresponding results being presented in Figures [\ref=tria] and [\ref=tessera], respectively.

Our method (red lines in the figures) recovers sufficiently well both the input rotation amplitude (black curve) and the orientation of the rotation axis (corresponding to the peak of the vdif(θ) diagram) for both cases, although the rotation curve for the lower sampling cluster case is noisy, as indeed expected. The [\citet=hwanglee] method identifies the orientation of the rotation axis accurately but not the rotation amplitude, as we already found also in the 3D case, for both sampling cases. Observing the results of these two cases we can conclude, as anticipated, that the richer the cluster the easier the rotation signal can be identified and the more accurately the rotation properties can be estimated. However, a cluster membership of 50 galaxies (or even lower, as we have verified) and a relatively large rotational velocity, is sufficient for the identification of the cluster rotational properties.

A next important test for systematics is to investigate the rotation identification as a function of the cluster rotational velocity. To this end we simulate sets of 50 Monte Carlo clusters each, all with the same statistical properties, but of which the rotational velocity is an increasing fraction of the virial one (from 0% to 100%), keeping the same rotation axis orientation ([formula]). In order to investigate the convolution of systematics related to the rotation amplitude and to sampling effects, we repeat the procedure for three cluster richnesses, ie., nmem = 1000, 50 and 30. For each set we calculate the mean and standard deviation of the recovered rotation amplitude and of the orientation of the rotation axis. Their recovery success provides us with the range of cluster parameters for which our method can successfully identify rotation.

In figure [\ref=one] we present the mean and standard deviation of the recovered rotation amplitudes (left panels) and of the orientation of the rotation axis (right panels) as a function of the ratio vrot / vvirial, where [formula] km/s. In the ideal case of very good sampling (upper panels), we see that our method correctly recovers the rotation amplitude with negligible uncertainty except for, as expected, the case of no or very small rotational velocity ([formula] of virial), while the already identified problem of the [\citet=hwanglee] method, that of underestimating the rotation amplitude, is shown here as well to be mostly independent of vrot / vvirial. Generally, we observe that in all cases our method recovers more accurately the rotational velocity amplitude for [formula], while the method of [\citet=hwanglee] performs slightly better in recovering, on average, the correct angle of the orientation axis. In general, the uncertainties in the orientation of the rotation axis are very large for the lower sampling cases (nmem  ≤  30). Therefore, we can conclude from this analysis that:

one may not expect to recover the characteristics of an existing rotation mode if the amplitude of the rotation is [formula] of the virial velocity and the sampling of the cluster members is low ([formula] galaxies/cluster), and

identifying the correct orientation of the rotation axis is more demanding than that of the rotation amplitude and typical uncertainties can be as large as [formula], when the sampling is low.

Data Analysis

Cluster and Galaxy Data

Our original sample consists of all Abell/ACO clusters [\citep=Abell89] of richness class R  ≥  1 and distance class 4 or 5 that are located in the SDSS survey area and have more than 50 galaxies with SDSS DR10 spectroscopy within a rest-frame radius of 2.5 h- 170 Mpc from the cluster centre and within a redshift separation of δz = 0.01 from the central cluster redshift (as provided by the NASA-NED database). After excluding a few clusters that are affected by the survey borders we are left with a sample of 103 Abell clusters, presented in Table [\ref=ttabl].

Clearing projection effects

Once we have selected our cluster sample and before we apply our rotation algorithm, we wish to clean each cluster of possible galaxy outliers and projection effects. Indeed, projected galaxies along the line of sight, but separated in velocity space would be a source of noise and could hide or erroneously enhance a rotation signal.

To this end, we plot for each cluster the relative to the cluster centre galaxy velocity frequency distribution, which has a mean value of zero. We expect that a virialised cluster should have a roughly Gaussian frequency distribution of line-of-sight velocities [\citep=gauss1] [\citep=gauss2] [\citep=gauss3]. Therefore a Gaussian is fitted to the data using the usual χ2 minimization procedure. Then, outliers are identified as those galaxies with velocities > 3σ away from the mean, which then are not considered in the rotation analysis.

Separating substructures

Furthermore, projected groups along the line of sight, but separated in velocity space, or substructures which have coherent infall velocities towards the parent cluster centre, could provide an erroneous rotation signal. Usually it is easy to identify such cases due to either the fact that in projection the substructures are clearly spatially separated from the main cluster, or in other cases where the different subclusters are clearly separated in velocity space but may appear as a unique cluster in projection. We have carefully inspected all of our clusters and identified those with significant subclumps and each was separately analysed for rotation. As an example, we show in Figure [\ref=A1228] the case of Abell 1228. The left panel shows the projected galaxy distribution, within a radius of 2.5 h- 170 Mpc, which appears as a typical centrally concentrated cluster, while the right panel shows the relative velocity distribution which reveals three separate subclumps (each separated by δv  ~  2000 km/s from the central one) projected along the line of sight. Had we analysed the whole "cluster", without separating the individual subclumps, we would have found a clear and strong signal of rotation. The two larger clumps have more than 50 members each and were separately analysed for rotation (and as we will see they do show strong rotation indications; see the Appendix).

This procedure was finally applied to ten clusters, which were found to be composed of two or more subclusters, increasing our total sample of clusters under study to 112. These clusters are: A659, A1035, A1228, A1291, A1775, A2067, A2197, A2245, A2255 and A2152 (details are presented in the Appendix). We wish to note that had we not separated these clusters they would all have shown significant and strong indications of rotation, exactly due to the coherent velocity differences of the subclusters. Nevertheless, in some cases, as we will see further below, one or even both separated subclusters show true evidence of rotation.

Finally, one must also ask what happens if the number of substructure member galaxies is a relatively small fraction of the whole cluster and/or the infall velocity is not as large as to be clearly separated in velocity space. Could such non-rotating clusters be erroneously identified as rotating? In section 4.3.4 we present extensive Monte-Carlo simulations tailored to answer such a question and provide the expected fraction of false rotation detections.

Cluster Richness and Mass

In order to have a more accurate determination of the cluster richness with respect to the original Abell's richness class and to investigate possible richness dependencies of our results, we calculate for each cluster the number of bright galaxies, N*, ie. those with [formula] in the r-band, using the luminosity function of [\citet=lumfun] with the K and evolutionary corrections of [\citet=kcor]. In order to check for obvious systematic effects we have tested whether the number of bright galaxies, N*, correlates with the cluster redshift. No such correlation was found indicating that N* is a redshift-free indication of the cluster richness and thus of the cluster mass.

Another indicator of the cluster mass is the cluster velocity dispersion, which is related to the mass via the virial theorem. A large velocity dispersion indicates a large cluster mass. Note however that cluster merging and significant cluster substructures can increase the measured velocity dispersion, but in this case it is not necessarily related to the cluster mass but to the highly unrelaxed cluster state.

One would expect the above two indicators of the cluster mass to be correlated and indeed they have a Spearman correlation coefficient of Rs≃0.46 with a probability of this correlation being random of P≃6  ×  10- 7.

Cluster Dynamical State

We also wish to investigate whether the possible cluster rotation is related to the cluster dynamical state. If, for example, the anisotropic accretion of matter along large-scale filaments entails infall with non-zero angular momentum, one may expect enhancement of rotational modes towards the cluster centre. To investigate this possibility we will use two well known indicators of the cluster dynamical state; their Bautz-Morgan (BM) type and the shape of their ICM X-ray profile.

The Bautz-Morgan type (BM) [\citep=bm] of Abell clusters is an indication of their morphology and thus of their dynamical state. It can be numerically characterized by a value increasing from one to three (1, 2 and 3) with two intermediate categories, which we index here as 1.5 and 2.5, respectively. The dynamical youth increases in the same order (or the dynamical evolution inversely), with BM type 1 indicating the most dynamically evolved cluster (spherically symmetric, centrally concentrated and cD dominated) while with BM type 3 the most loose, asymmetric and thus unrelaxed cluster.

Similarly, we will use all the available X-ray cluster images to characterize their dynamical state. We define the X-ray profile parameter, Xp, which can take three possible values, Xp = 1 for roughly spherically symmetric and smooth X-ray emission profiles (virialized, dynamically evolved), Xp = 2 for asymmetric and/or distorted profile (dynamically young) and Xp = 0 if the X-ray image is not available. The main source of the X-ray images used come from the Einstein observations [\citep=Jones99]. In total, we have available X-ray images for 50 out of the 111 Abell clusters of our sample.

Since both previously discussed parameters should reflect the cluster dynamical state, they should be correlated. Indeed, we find that the two parameters correlate nicely and provide a Spearman correlation coefficient of Rs≃0.53 and a probability of this correlation being random of P≃7  ×  10- 5.

Application of our algorithm

The rotation analysis is performed using galaxies within either a circular region around the cluster centre, having a radius of 1.5h- 170 or 2.5h- 170 Mpc, or within circular rings of different widths. The latter because we wish to investigate whether the cluster's possible rotation signal comes from the outskirts or the central cluster regions, but also because the central regions are affected more severly by projection effects that could contribute in weakening an existing rotation signal.

By identifying the cluster regions, if any, that show a rotational signal we may get hints as to which is the mechanism producing it. In virialized clusters one may expect that virial relaxation would have erased any initial rotational mode. However, in oblate-like clusters (although clusters appear to be mostly prolate-like [\citep=shape] [\citep=Basilakos00]) the collapse along their minor axis may retain and even enchance some initial rotation. On the other hand, if in dynamically young clusters the rotation is caused by interactions and merging, one should expect only the cluster outskirts to show more prominent rotational indications. Excluding from our analysis the cluster central regions, where projections along the line-of-sight are more severe, may be helpful in this respect.

Summarizing, we will investigate the cluster rotation in each cluster using four different angular configurations:

the circular area within 1.5h- 170 Mpc radius

the circular ring within 0.3-1.5h- 170 Mpc.

the circular area within 2.5h- 170 Mpc radius.

the circular ring within 0.5-2.5h- 170 Mpc.

A further issue that could be important in identifying a rotational mode in clusters is the selection of the true rotational centre, if such exists. We therefore apply our rotation identification procedure using 9 different possible centres, forming a rectangle around the nominal centre of the cluster (figure [\ref=points]). The separation between the consequitive centres is 5% of the cluster radius. We finally choose as our optimum rotational centre that for which the smooth simusoidal "ideal rotation" curve (see section 4.3.1) fits best the data rotation curve, ie. that which corresponds to the minimum χ2 value (see Fig.11 for an example).

Identification of significant rotation

In order to make a decision whether a cluster has a significant rotational mode or not we will use the combination of two tests, which consist of:

comparing the distribution of relative velocities, in each of two hemispheres and for each rotation angle θ, using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test, and

comparing the data rotation curve separately with an "ideal rotation curve" and a "random rotation curve" suitably estimated for each cluster, by using the usual χ2 statistic. If v(θi) and vm(θi) are respectively the data and model mean velocity difference between the two semispheres at a rotation angle θi, we define:

[formula]

with the data rotation curve uncertainty given by:

[formula]

where σv,1 and σv,2 are the velocity dispersions and n1 and n2 are the number of galaxies in semicircles 1 and 2, respectively, at each rotation angle θ. σm,θ is the model rotatioφρn curve uncertainty provided by the scatter among the different Monte-Carlo realizations of the random or ideal rotation curves.

Test 1: Ideal versus Random rotation curves

In order to build the ideal rotation and random rotation curves we follow the following recipe: For each cluster we identify the angle at which the maximum rotational velocity (vmax = vrot) is observed in its rotation diagram (θrot). This angle splits the cluster in two semispheres; and to the galaxies of each we attach a velocity vlos = vmax / 2 and vlos =  - vmax / 2, respectively. We then apply our rotation identification algorithm on this new configuration to produce the "ideal rotation" diagram with which we compare the data rotation diagram, quantifying the goodness of fit by the χ2 statistic (eq.[\ref=chi3]), which we name χ2id. A value of [formula] (where df are the degrees of freedom, in our case the number of steps in θ) shows that the data rotation curve is well represented by the ideal one.

We also construct for each cluster a rotation curve which corresponds to that of a random distribution of velocity residuals. To this end we shuffle the galaxy line-of-sight velocities randomly while keeping the same galaxy coordinates. Then, our rotation identification algorithm is applied and this process is repeated 10000 times. The final "random rotation curve", is the average over all the realizations, while the scatter σvri around the mean is also estimated. Finally, we determine the χ2 statistic between the data and random rotation curves, which we tag χ2r.

We can now select the candidate rotational clusters as those for which

[formula]

ie., those for which the ideal rotation curve fits the data rotation curves significantly better. If the opposite occurs then the cluster is likely not rotating. Therefore the ratio χ2id  /  χ2r is a useful parameter for assesing rotation or not.

Test 2: KS two sample test

We also apply the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test to the distributions of the relative velocities of the galaxies of the two cluster semicircles for each angle θ. This test practically calculates the probability, PKS, that the two relative velocity distributions have the same parent distribution. The bigger the probability the more likely it is that the two distributions are mutually consistent. For a rotating cluster we expect a significant difference between the two velocity distribution, and the corresponding PKS probability limit is taken, somehow arbitrarily, to be PKS = 0.01 (ie., values lower than this limit are taken to signify significantly different distributions).

Final Criteria for a Rotating Cluster

We therefore have four criteria that can be used to deduce a significant or not cluster rotation, which we call the strict criteria, and are:

χ2id / df between the real and ideal rotation curve, which should be less or equal to 1 for a rotating cluster,

χ2r / df between the real rotation curve and random curve, which should be >  1 for a rotating cluster,

χ2id  /  χ2r, which should be ideally ≪  1 for a rotating cluster, but practically we take it to be ≤  0.2, and

the Kolmogorov-Smirnov probability, PKS, between the galaxy relative velocity distributions of the two semicircles of maximum difference, which should be: PKS < 0.01.

These criteria can be relaxed to provide a less secure identification of rotation. For example, we also checked for clusters fullfilling only the following two criteria: χ2id  /  χ2r < 0.4 and PKS < 0.01. We call these the loose criteria for cluster rotation.

The fraction of false detections

We wish to address the issue of what is the fraction of false detections of rotation according to the above selected criteria, when there is no intrinsic rotation present. Two such different possibilities of false detections exist:

due to shot-noise, related to small number statistics, and

due to the presense of an unidentified substructure that has a coherent infall velocity with respect to the cluster mean, and which can be erroneously assesed as rotation. The substructures that could still remain unidentified after the procedure discussed in section 4.1.2 are those which cannot be spatially or dynamically separated (ie., those which are near the cluster centre and which do not have a large infall velocity).

To investigate these possibilities we simulate 1000 Monte-Carlo clusters, according to the basic recipe of section 3 with either 50 or 100 members, which is the membership range more susceptible to rotation misidentification.

To address the first possibility we assign to the mock galaxies only virial velocities and find only a small fraction of our mock clusters showing a false rotational signal. Under the strict criteria we find a ~  1.9% false detection rate for clusters with either N = 50 or 100 members. Using the loose criteria the corresponding fraction is ~   4.4%. These fractions are small enough to allow us to conclude that shot-noise effects are unimportant for the size of clusters considered in this work.

In order to address the second possibility we introduce a subclump which contains between 10% and 28% of the main cluster members, positionally placed on one of the projected quadrants of the cluster at a distance of 420 h- 170 kpc from the cluster centre and having as a mean infall velocity a fraction (50% or 100%) of the cluster virial velocity dispersion (note that we randomly assign to each substructure member an infall velocity having the above mean and a standard deviation of 500 km/sec). The range of these parameters where selected after a number of trials in order to mimic cases where the 3σ clipping of the member velocity distribution or the clear positional identification of the substructure would have failed to identify the substructure as such. In figure 10 we present the results as the probability of misidentifying an infalling substructure (with the previously discussed characteristics) for cluster rotation as a function of substructure richness (in percentage of main cluster membership). We see that for the case where such substructres exist the probability of them being misidentified as a cluster rotation is between ~  0.1 - 0.3 depending on the substructure richness and infall velocity.

RESULTS

Individual cluster results

Each cluster or subcluster in our sample is analysed in all four angular configurations according to the following sequence, the basic steps of which are already presented in section 5.2. First, we search for the best centre of possible rotation among nine tested (a related diagram for A85 is shown in figure [\ref=A85cen] as an example). Using the selected centre, we apply our algorithm and construct the rotational diagram of the data, the ideal rotation and that of the random velocity residuals, while we also construct the KS probability curve as a function of rotation angle, θ. The results of this analysis are then passed through the criteria discussed in section 4.3.3. to decide whether a significant rotation has been detected, at any of the angular configurations of the cluster.

In order to facilitate the visual verification of our results, we also construct for each cluster an aggregate plot with four panels, where we display:

(a) in the upper left panel the spatial distribution of the galaxies and their selected rotational centre, where residing and approaching galaxies are in red and blue colour, respectively, rejected galaxies due to velocity criteria are shown as black crosses, while rejected galaxies due to angular selection criteria as faint crosses,

(b) in the upper right panel the histogram of the line-of-sight galaxy velocities along with the fitted Gaussian,

(c) in the lower left panel the data rotation diagram (points with errorbars), the ideal rotation (red continuous curve) and random rotation curves (blue continuous curve with dashed curves corresponding to 1σ uncertainty), and

(d) in the bottom left panel the Kolmogorov-Smirnov probability diagram as a function of rotation angle θ.

We will not present such diagrams for all the clusters of our sample, except for a few examples here and some interesting cases in the appendix. As one example, we present for A85 the corresponding plots for the two main angular configurations (r < 1.5h- 170 and r < 2.5h- 170 Mpc).

We remind the reader that A85 is a rather rich BMI cluster at a redshift 〈z〉 = 0.055, whose galaxy members with [formula] (from SDSS DR10) vary between 68 and 155 at the two radii used. The relatively virialized nature of this cluster is confirmed by its smooth spherical X-ray profile [\citep=ein], although there are strong indications, when one goes to much fainter galaxies, of substructures [\citep=a85]. However, if such substructures are manifested in the cluster velocity distribution they are already excluded by our "cleaning" procedure. Indeed there is such a case in A85, appearing as a small but separated peak in velocity space at 〈v〉≃ - 2800 km/sec (see the velocity histogram in figure [\ref=A85r].

In figure [\ref=A85r] we present the basic results of our analysis for the two cluster radii. Although for the r = 1.5h- 170 Mpc case there is a smooth sinusoidal rotation curve, exactly what expected for the ideal rotation (red curve), this cluster misses complying with the strict criteria of rotation, due to a value of PKS = 0.0109 slightly above the limit of 0.01 and due to χ2r < 1. However, it complies with the loose criteria and thus it is considered as possibly rotating (but with a relatively low rotational velocity amplitude). When considering the larger cluster radius (right four panels of figure [\ref=A85r]) we see that the indications of rotation vanish, a fact which could be due to small substructures acting as noise or due to a possibly different velocity distribution of the outskirt galaxies with respect to the inner ones; if for example they are infalling roughly isotropically to the cluster centre from the large-scale surrounding structure.

To complete the presentation of some characteristic examples, we show in figure [\ref=A1367] the relevant results for A1367, a rich and relatively nearby cluster (z = 0.022), which is strongly rotating showing a very clear, significant and unambiguous sinusoidal rotation diagram (for both radii).

Abell Clusters with rotation

Clusters for which we detect significant rotation, using either the strict or the loose criteria of rotation detection are presented in table [\ref=t1] (for the r = 1.5h- 170 Mpc case), and table [\ref=t2] (for the r = 2.5h- 170 Mpc case). In each table we also indicate clusters that show rotation only when excluding the inner cluster core (those with the star symbol), since projection effects are more severe along the the central part of clusters, where typically a larger volume along the line of sight direction is sampled. The tables list the final number of galaxy cluster members selected, their mean redshift, the values of the four rotation indices discussed in section 4.3.3, the angle θrot of the rotation axis, which is the angle of the maximum semi-circle mean velocity difference, the rotation amplitude, vrot, which is the maximum velocity difference in the rotation diagram, the cluster velocity dispersion, σv, and the (crudely) corrected velocity dispersion after removing the cluster rotation (see section 5.3.4). Note that half of the clusters (with r = 1.5h- 170 Mpc) showing rotation under the loose criteria just miss being detected as rotating under the strict criteria (ie., A1203, A1377, A2399, A1983*).

Effect of excluding the cluster core region

Of the 13 clusters within r = 1.5h- 170 Mpc showing rotation under the strict criteria, A2670 shows strong rotation after excluding the core region (< 0.3h- 170 Mpc) but it had also been detected as a rotating cluster under the loose criteria. Excluding the core region, one cluster (A2255a) loses completely its rotation while another cluster (A1035a) is downgraded into the loose criteria rotation detection regime. The corresponding numbers for the loose criteria case are 2 clusters (A1983 and A2197b) showing rotation only after excluding the core region and one (A1377) losing completely its rotation.

For the r = 2.5h- 170 Mpc case, out of the 26 clusters showing rotation under the strict criteria, 8 were detected only after excluding the inner < 0.5h- 170 Mpc core region. However, of these clusters four (A1913, A2022, A2089, A2147) had already been found rotating under the loose criteria. The only clusters found rotating under the strict criteria that lose completely their rotation when excluding the core region are: A1228a, A2067a and A2399. Other 5 clusters rotating under the strict criteria drop below the nmem = 50 limit but retain their significant rotation detection. Similarly, out of the remaining 7 clusters with rotation under the loose criteria (excluding the 4 that were upgraded to the strict regime when excluding the core region), two (A1552 and A2029) where detected only when the core region was excluded. Finally, two clusters (A2063 and A2670) lose completely their rotation when excluding the core region.

Statistical results

In order to attempt to understand our results and possible causes of the cluster rotation, we will attempt to identify correlations between interesting cluster properties and rotation. To this end, we will use the Spearman correlation coefficient between any two parameters, Rs, and the probability that the correlations are consistent with the random expectation, P. Positive Rs means positive correlation, while negative Rs means anti-correlation; a value near zero means the two parameters are not correlated. A small value of P indicates a significant correlation or anti-correlation at that level. We will report only relatively strong and significant correlations, and as such we define: |Rs| > 0.25 and P < 0.05.

A first observation is that all the indices that we use to deduce rotation are correlated stronglyamong them, as they should. The value of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov probability, PKS, and the value of the ratio of the χ2 minimium values between the ideal and real rotation diagrams are strongly correlated with each other in all angular configurations. As a result, all can deduce rotation; on condition that one of them shows rotational signal, the other will also show rotational signal. Also the amplitude of the rotation, vrot, is strongly correlated with the two rotation indices. This also should be expected since when the rotational velocity is large, the rotation will be more clearly identified, and vice-versa. These correlations are shown in Figure [\ref=25ind].

Check for systematic biases of the rotation indices

Before we present our main results it is important to make sure that we understand the possible systematic effects of the resulting rotation indices for the clusters studied. We have already investigated and quantified the effect of shot-noise and undetected substructures (section 4.3.4), however, we further check for correlation of the resulting rotation indices on the number of galaxy members, nmem, and on z. As we already showed, nmem needs to be relatively large in order to unambigiously detect a rotation if such exist. However, since the input galaxy catalogue (the SDSS DR10 spectroscopic catalogue) is limited to mr  ~  17.77, when we look at larger distances we observe less and brighter galaxy cluster members. Therefore, there will be an unavoidable redshift dependence of the cluster galaxy membership and thus a redshift dependence of the rotation indices is possible. This does not necessarily imply an important problem but rather that the fraction of rotating clusters found should be considered a lower limit.

In any case, we have tested for such a dependence and indeed when we use all of our cluster sample, independent of galaxy membership, we find a weak correlation between the most important rotation index, ie., χ2id  /  χ2r, and the cluster redshift, with a Spearman correlation coefficient Rs = 0.26 and a probability of being random of P = 0.006 (the corresponding correlation for the r = 2.5h- 170 Mpc is insignificant). However, even this weak correlation vanishes when [formula] and thus our main results, which are based on the nmem  ≥  50 subsample, are free of this weak systematic redshift dependence.

Regarding the PKS rotation index, due to the nature of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we do expect a dependence of PKS to the number nmem of cluster members and since the latter is anticorrelated with z (as discussed previously), we expect a correlation of PKS with z. Indeed we find such a weak (Rs =  - 0.37) but significant (P≃10- 4) dependence for the r = 1.5h- 170 Mpc case. However, this correlation becomes weaker when we use clusters with nmem  ≥  50. For the r = 2.5h- 170 Mpc case all the above correlations appear significantly weaker.

Fraction of rotating clusters

In this section we present some basic statistics regarding the fraction of clusters that show indications of rotation, based on both strict and loose rotation criteria, as defined in the previous section. In table [\ref=fract] we present the number of clusters and the corresponding fraction of the total that show strict or loose indications of rotation for two cases: (a) clusters of whatever final galaxy membership, and (b) for cluster with nmem  ≥  50, for which the rotation identification is quite secure. The fractions are slightly different when limiting the studied area within 1.5 or 2.5 h- 170 Mpc of the cluster centre, with the latter being larger than the former.

Overall, it is secure to say that Abell clusters with nmem  ≥  50 showing significant indications of rotation, within either of the two limiting radii, range between ~  25% (for the strict cirteria) and ~  38% (for the loose criteria) of the total.

It should be noted however, that the specific clusters showing rotation at the different radii are not always the same. In particular, out of the 21 clusters of table [\ref=t1], only 12 are found to be rotating when using r = 2.5h- 170 Mpc. Also, many more clusters appear to be rotating when we extend our analysis to r = 2.5h- 170 Mpc rather than within r = 1.5h- 170 Mpc. In particular, out of the 33 clusters listed in table [\ref=t2], only 19 are found to be rotating in the r = 1.5h- 170 Mpc case, taking also into account those that drop below the nmem = 50 limit.

We can reach an overall number, and the corresponding final fraction of rotating clusters with nmem  ≥  50 at any of the two radii and taking also into account results based on excluding the core region (see below): Using the strict criteria we find 31 such clusters, corresponding to ~  35% of the total (89), while using the loose criteria we find 43 such clusters, corresponding to ~  48% of total.

Fraction of Clockwise and Anticlockwise rotating clusters

As we discussed in section 2.1 our algorithm provides us with the direction of rotation for the rotating clusters. What is expected in an initially irrotational Universe on large-scales is the lack of a preferred direction of cluster rotation. In Table 2 and 3 we present the direction of rotation for each of our rotating clusters, indicated by the symbol I which takes the value 1 for rotation or 2 for counter rotation. For the r = 1.5h- 170 Mpc case we find that overall there are 15 anticlockwise clusters and only 6 clockwise, while for the r = 2.5h- 170 Mpc case we find 19 and 13, respectively. There appears to be a slight preference for clockwise rotating clusters, but is the number difference, Δ = 9 for the former case and Δ = 6 for the latter case statistically significant? The Poisson uncertainty of Δ is σΔ≃4.6 and 5.6 for the two cases, respectively, a fact which implies that the difference is significant only at a 2σ and 1σ level, respectively. We do not consider as overwelming the former significance and we conclude that there is no significant evidence for a preferred direction of rotation among the rotating clusters.

Correcting the cluster velocity dispersion for rotation

In order to correct the cluster velocity dispersion, assumed to be due to roughly isotropic galaxy orbits, for the rotational modes, we assume that the two velocity components are independent and that the expected cluster velocity dispersion due to the rotational velocity vrot can be approximated, assuming an ideal rotation, as:

[formula]

Therefore, the corrected cluster velocity dispersion, σv,cor, is approximately provided by the following:

[formula]

For the majority of the rotating clusters, the corrected velocity dispersion is not dramatically altered, but the correction is not insignificant. Defining the fractional difference between corrected and uncorrected cluster velocity dispersion as

[formula]

we obtain for the r = 1.5h- 170 Mpc case a median value of ~  10%, and a mean value of 〈δσv〉  ~  12%. A similar analysis for cluster rotation out to r = 2.5h- 170 Mpc provides the following fractional differences: a median value of ~  12%, and a mean value of 〈δσv〉  ~  15%. The corresponding corrected cluster mass is given by:

[formula]

implying a corrected cluster mass reduced by 20% - 30% on average, with respect to that uncorrected for rotation.

Note that for the r = 2.5h- 170 Mpc case we have some interesting clusters which have a large rotational component (quite rotationally supported), like A659a, A1137, A1228b and A2022 with δσv  ~  30%, 45%, 32% and 37%, respectively.

Correlations between Cluster Rotation and Cluster Physical Parameters

We attempt to investigate whether there are correlations between the rotation indices and the different physical properties of the clusters, dynamical or other. We correlate the two main rotation indices, ie., χ2id  /  χ2r and PKS with the characteristics of the cluster dynamical state, ie., BM type and Xr (defined in section 4.1.4), and with the cluster mass, characterized either by the number of bright galaxies, N*, or by the cluster velocity dispersion, σv (defined in section 4.1.3).

For both radii we find no significant correlations between cluster mass or cluster dynamical state and rotation indices. However, since the majority of clusters do not show signs of rotation they would act as noise weakening possible correlations between rotation and cluster parameters. Indeed, selecting only clusters that show rotation we do find significant correlations but only between the strength and significance of rotation and cluster dynamical state (not with cluster mass), in the direction of a correlation between rotation strength and dynamical youth (see table [\ref=Spear]). When we analyze clusters that show rotation for the the r = 2.5h- 170 Mpc case, we find significantly weaker and insignificant correlations (and only between BM and PKS).

We can conclude that there are indications that the cluster rotation is related to the earlier phases of cluster evolution, when anisotropic accretion and merging takes place.

Conclusions

We searched for possible cluster rotation in a sample of Abell clusters using galaxy-member redshifts from the SDSS DR10 spectroscopic database. We developed a new algorithm in order to be able to deduce rotation using the line-of-sight velocities of the galaxy members. We checked and verified the performance of this algorithm by applying it on various Monte-Carlo simulated clusters with known rotational characteristics. We also compared our method with that of the [\citet=hwanglee] method.

Our algorithm provides the significance of the rotation identification (with a set of indices), the rotation amplitude, the position angle of the rotation axis, whether the rotation is clock or anticlock-wise and the rotation centre. We find that the amplitude of the rotation is correlated with the indications of rotation; the larger the rotation amplitude the more significant are the indications of rotation. This implies that small amplitude rotation may not be easy to identify, and thus it could pass undetected.

We then applied our algorithm on our sample of Abell clusters using two different sets of criteria for rotation identification, the so-called strict and loose criteria and two different outer cluster radii (1.5 and 2.5 h- 170 Mpc). Out of 89 cluster with more than 50 member galaxies we have found in total 31 rotating clusters (in any of the 2 radii studied) using the strict criteria of rotation identification and 43 such clusters using the loose criteria of rotation identification, corresponding to a fraction of ~  35% and ~  48%, respectively.

Finally, when we use the inner radius case (1.5 h- 170 Mpc) we find strong correlations between the cluster dynamical state (X-ray isophotal shape as well as the BM type) and the significance and strength of cluster rotation, which means that rotation is related to dynamically young clusters and that the virialization processes will tend to erase such a rotation if it exists. This hints that the possible cause of inner radius rotation could be related to the initial anisotropic accretion of matter having significant angular momentum, which gets amplified by collapse. The fact that we find no such correlations when we use the outer cluster radius (2.5 h- 170 Mpc) hints towards a different cause of the relevant rotation possibly possibly being related to coherent motions of substructures in the cluster outskirts prior to dynamically disturbing the cluster inner regions.

Clusters divided in substrustures

We list here those clusters of our sample that were found to consist in velocity space of two or more well-separated substructures. These clusters were separated into their different components, which were individually analysed for rotation when possible.

Abell 659 Abell 659 presents a substructure of 14 foreground galaxies in the 2.5 h- 170 Mpc and 0.5-2.5 h- 170 Mpc configurations, which led us to split the cluster in two groups in these two configurations. The main cluster, A659a, consists of 50 galaxy members and shows strong indications of rotation in both configurations, while the foreground group has too few galaxies to be analysed for rotation. This cluster appears to have a significant rotational component.

Abell 1035 Another interesting case is Abell 1035. This cluster presents a background subcluster in all four configurations studied. The two subclusters were found to rotate with similar rotation amplitudes, but with perpendicular rotation axes on the plane of the sky.

Abell 1228 Abell 1228 was found to consist of three well-separated components in velocity space aligned along the line-of-sight, in all four spatial configurations (see figure 8). Two components are rich enough to be analysed for rotation and indeed they show strong indications of rotation, in the 2.5 h- 170 Mpc and 0.5-2.5 h- 170Mpc configurations, with rotational velocity amplitude of ~  160 km/s (A1228a) and ~  350 km/s (A1228b). The two subclusters rotate in the same direction (I = 2) but have their (projected on the plane of the sky) rotation axes perpendicular to each other (figure A1).

Abell 1291 Another interesting case is Abell 1291. Studying its galaxy member velocity distribution we again identify 3 different peaks, clearly separated from each other. The third and most distant substructure could not be studied due to its small richness. From the other two only the nearest one (A1291a) show indications of rotation for the 2.5 h- 170 Mpc and 0.5-2.5 h- 170 Mpc configurations.

Abell 1775 We found a foreground group of galaxies in velocity space and in all the four spatial configurations. This substructure is placed south-east of the main cluster of galaxies and was not found to present any indications of rotation in any of the configurations.

Abell 2067 This cluster seems to have a neighbouring group of galaxies which is witnessed in the 2.5 h- 170 Mpc and 0.5-2.5 h- 170 Mpc configurations in both the velocity distribution as a second peak close to the main peak and in the spatial distribution of the galaxies as a clump north-west of the cluster centre. The substructure has too few members to be analysed. However, the main cluster shows strong indications of rotation in the 2.5 h- 170 Mpc configuration.

Abell 2152 Abell 2152 presents a main group of galaxies found to have strong indications of rotation in all configurations. In the 1.5 h- 170 Mpc and 0.3-1.5 h- 170 Mpc configurations, some foreground galaxies are found with a wide velocity distribution, but very few to be analysed for rotation. In the other two configurations, the number of these galaxies increases, allowing us to study it. The main and the foreground group are both found to be rotating with similar amplitudes and in opposite directions (see Figure A2).

Abell 2197 Abel 2197 has two very close peaks in the velocity distribution in all the four configurations. This cluster could have formed by a merger of two smaller groups of clusters. None of the subclusters has been found to have strong indications of rotation in any of the configurations.

Abell 2245 Looking at the two close peaks in the velocity distribution of the galaxy members and their spatial distribution, we conclude that Abell 2245 comprises of two overlapping groups of galaxies. None of them shows any indications of rotation in any of the four configurations studied.

Abell 2255 Abell 2255 was found to have two peaks in the velocity distribution of its galaxy members; a sharp one, A2255b, and a foreground, lower and wider one, A2255a. Indications of rotation have only been found for the latter group of galaxies in the 1.5 h- 170 Mpc and 0.3-1.5 h- 170 Mpc configurations.
