On Mach's Principle and the "Special" Theory of Relativity

"Inertial" and Rotating Frames of Reference

What is so "special" about the Special Theory of Relativity? The name was given by Einstein to say that it is about a special class of "reference frames" or observers who are said to be "inertial" [\cite=einstein4manuscript]. Put another way, these observers are moving with constant velocities with respect to each other and are not rotating. Put yet another way, they are not experiencing an external force or a centrifugal force. The statement or the "postulate" of this theory is that all laws of physics, including the one that says light travels 186 thousand miles a second, take the same form for all of these observers. What it implies experimentally is this: Imagine a team of scientists sailing through space in inter-galactic space, or even inter-stellar space, far away from any massive object producing a significant gravitational field. They are in isolated laboratories moving at different velocities with respect to each other and the labs themselves are electrically neutral and of negligible mass so that they don't exert forces on each other. The theory says then that none of them can perform any experiment that tells them whether or not they are moving with respect to the rest of the universe [\cite=einstein1910principe]. There did not seem to be a unique frame of reference in which the universe is at rest.

Enter: the General Theory of Relativity

Einstein then thought, if there is no unique frame of reference that is not in motion, then why are there unique frames of reference that are free of acceleration, or of rotation? What makes these "special" frames of reference so special [\cite=einstein1913physikalische] [\cite=einstein2007present] [\cite=einstein2003relativitats]? Why are the laws of physics so simple in these frames and not others? Why is there a centrifugal force in every state of rotation except one? He found the answer in a principle due to Ernst Mach [\cite=mach2013science] [\cite=einstein1916grundlage] (although it is not explicitly reflected in the so-called "Einstein equations") [\cite=Godel] [\cite=hartle2013gravity] [\cite=raine1981mach] [\cite=lynden1995mach] [\cite=lichtenegger2004mach]. When we rotate, we don't just experience a centrifugal force, we also see the "fixed stars" or distant galaxies (if we have the luxury of a telescope) moving around us. So these two facts must somehow be connected. So Einstein made the bold proclamation that even though there is no state of absolute rest, there is a state of absolutely no rotation, and that it is dictated by the distribution of mass in the entire universe. (The next time you experience an outward force about an axis, you can blame the distant stars and Ernst Mach!)

Rotation and "Translation": what is so different?

The General Theory of Relativity says that once you have enough mass in the neighborhood to bend spacetime, the concept of an inertial reference frame (and hence of "Lorentz invariance", which we will define shortly) becomes a very local one [\cite=einstein1912lichtgeschwindigkeit]. There is no longer a finite (non-zero) region of spacetime where inertial observers maintain their state of motion with respect to each other. Still, this did not stop Einstein and others from imagining regions of spacetime far away from any gravitating mass where Lorentz invariance still holds.

Physicists often speak about two things called "translational" invariance and rotational invariance. Einstein himself has invoked these principles in a cosmological context [\cite=einstein1923kosmologische] where they are given the even more fancy names "homogeneity" and "isotropy". They just mean that in some fundamental sense, all places are the same and all directions are the same. The "Lorentz invariance" [\cite=mst] that Einstein came up with says that all velocities are the same as well. That is, all inertial frames are equivalent no matter how they are moving with respect to each other. This invariance can be considered as the "conjugate" to translational invariance. So an analogous "conjugate" to rotational invariance would be the invariance between frames of reference rotating with respect to each other at different angular velocities. But such an invariance evidently does not hold in the real universe that we know and love.

The Discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background

Albert Einstein died in 1955. At around the same time, a background radiation in the radio wavelengths coming from the far reaches of space was predicted [\cite=alpher1948origin] [\cite=penzias1979origin], but no serious successful effort was made to actually detect it. It was detected for the first time in 1964 completely accidentally [\cite=penzias1965measurement] and then recognized shortly [\cite=dicke1965cosmic] [\cite=smoot2007nobel]. With the wavelength resolution available at the time it looked completely smooth and "isotropic" [\cite=1967MEASURE]. However, it did not take long to theorize that if you're an observer (with a microwave telescope) who is in a significantly boosted frame of reference with respect to the earth, you will see a dipole anisotropy in the direction of motion and with a strength that is a known monotonous function of how fast you're moving. The earth itself was moving relatively slowly though [\cite=1967SCIAMA].

Humans eventually sent microwave telescopes into space and achieved spectral resolution high enough to detect anisotropies in the CMB. It was announced and we finally knew on April 23, 1992 [\cite=smoot2007nobel] where our planet is heading. The primary anisotropy that was measured was a dipole anisotropy corresponding to a velocity of 229 miles a second in the -7[formula] declination and +168[formula] right ascension direction [\cite=aghanim2014planck] with which the earth is drifting through the "CMB rest frame". Adherents of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model [\cite=friedman1922krummung] of the universe usually call it the "comoving frame". Let's just call it the ether.

The thought experiment that beats all thought experiments

Let us change terminology for a while. The laboratories sailing through interstellar space in the above picture are actually prisons and the scientists were put in there before they were born by their galactic overlord Hendrik Lorentz. Other than that everything is the same. The prisons still have negligible mass and the prisoners are allowed to do any experiment whatever within their six walls. Now Lorentz decides to make the walls of the prisons transparent to microwaves. The prisons sail on their trajectory of "uniform rectilinear motion" and there is no difference between any of them [\cite=einstein2007present] until the prisoners start building their own microwave interferometers. Once they can see the CMB, they see that one side looks "blue" and the other side looks "red". They know which way they are going with respect to the rest of the universe [\cite=barbour1995mach].

So now Lorentz tries to enforce his invariance by putting mirrors around the prison walls that reflect all the CMB photons. Here's the problem: feeble as the CMB is, since the labs themselves are of negligible mass, when each photon is reflected it imparts a great acceleration to the lab. The "radiation pressure" caused by this is uneven on the two sides and consequently, the scientist and all his stuff start drifting toward the wall facing the bluer side of the CMB. If the inmates can communicate all of their observations with the other prisons, they can get a pretty good idea of how fast they are moving through the ether. As the lab slows down, the magnitude of its deceleration decreases exponentially with time. Still, if the mass of the laboratory is really tiny, the friction of the CMB photons quickly brings it to rest. So Lorentz finds out that the only way to make the laboratories resilient to the CMB wind is to make them a little massive, the very thing he wanted to avoid in the first place because of the whole "gravity" thing!

So we find now that there is no such thing as a "test mass" that can withstand the ether wind and sail through it according to Newton's First Law. It takes mass to have inertia [\cite=eotvos1891anziehung]. After all, "Inertia" is just another name for mass [\cite=einstein1905does].

The ether rediscovered

Einstein himself proposed a new concept of the ether within the framework of the General Theory of Relativity [\cite=einstein1920ather]. Anyway, some of the differences between the CMB and the original ether that Poincar√© and Einstein banished are as follows: The CMB is not a rigid medium that causes a lot of friction for massive bodies like the original ether. It is not a medium for light, but is made of light itself. In fact, it does not interact with other photons at all, so it does not do anything to the speed of light or even to the wavelength. So absolute time and absolute space can remain forgotten. But we now have a huge distribution of light-like trajectories that come together statistically to define a preferred reference frame. We would also like to note that when it comes to the behavior of a negligible test mass in the real universe that we know, not only is Special Relativity an idealization, but so is Newtonian mechanics and Galilean invariance [\cite=einstein1913physikalische]. No matter where you go, a body of negligible mass does not obey Newton's First Law, it follows the mechanics of Aristotle [\cite=raine1981mach].

Rotation and the Background

If a body rotates with respect to the cosmic background, that is much more obvious. Inside a "prison", even a feeble rotation can be detected by measuring the Coriolis effect using a laser ring gyroscope [\cite=bondi1997lense]. So then, rotational motion with respect to the CMB is different from translational motion only by virtue of the ease of detection. The difference between the state of absolute rest and that of absolute non-rotation is not one of existence, or of concept, but of how difficult it is to observe it. It is sort of like the difference between gravitational waves [\cite=abbott2016observation] and electromagnetic waves (light). So there is something from the distant universe that tells us our state of absolute translational motion. Einstein somehow missed this [\cite=einstein1920ather] (Probably because his eyes could not see microwaves; just kidding!). Here is the problem: Einstein's entire scientific career was within the period between 1887 and 1964. Michelson and Morley had already done their experiment showing no dependence of the speed of light on the state of translational motion [\cite=lorentz1906versuch]. The microwave background (or any other kind of cosmic background that spans all across the sky) had not been discovered and there was no way to detect a small boost with respect to the universe by performing a statistical analysis of the sky. It was that window of time when scientists had every reason to think that space was truly empty.

The only thing that seemed to break Lorentz invariance was nearby masses producing a gravitational field according to the inverse square law (or Einstein's tensor variation of it) [\cite=mst]. The "field" from the distant masses seemed to break the invariance between rotating reference frames but not between inertial reference frames. Einstein's imagination took him away from the nearby stars, but even Einstein could not imagine getting away from the distant stars.

The works of Latter-day "Machians"

In the limit of instantaneous communication, the "Lagrangian" of the universe can be rewritten [\cite=barbour1995machmen] as,

[formula]

where i ranges over all the bodies in the universe, [formula] is the relative displacement vector between body i and body j, [formula] is the angular velocity of the displacement vector, [formula] is the angular velocity of the distant masses in our frame of reference and

[formula]

In this form the velocities of individual bodies with respect to the reference frame do not appear and instead only the relative displacements and velocities appear. So it would give the correct equations of motion for all the bodies even in non-inertial reference frames, thereby satisfying Mach's principle.

Attempts at incorporating Mach's principle into the Einstein equations have usually involved specifying some conditions on how the metric and energy tensors look on a time-slice (that is, a space-like hypersurface) of the universe [\cite=raine1975mach] [\cite=raine1981mach]. Modifying the cosmological constant term does not seem to be in fashion.

Conclusion and Ideas for Future Thinkers

The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation gives us a way to measure our state of absolute motion with respect to the universe. The frame of reference of absolute rest is as sacred as the frame of reference of absolute non-rotation.

However, what about the opposite implication (the converse, that is)? If translational motion is so relative, how relative is rotational motion? Does your state of rotation depend on where you are or what is around you? How much does the fact that we live on a massive planet blind us to the one true and holy state of absolute non-rotation? Lense and Thirring have already analyzed this question quantitatively [\cite=lense1918einfluss].

And what does this mean for quantum mechanics? Does it help explain John Bell's version [\cite=bell1964einstein] of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox [\cite=einstein1935can]? What does it mean to measure the same component of spin or to orient two polarizers the same way when they are in different remote locations? What is the measuring device oriented with respect to? How does a point particle spin in relation to the rest of the universe? What does this imply for a theory that endeavors to unify the forces of gravity and electricity [\cite=einstein1935particle] [\cite=maldacena2013cool]? Who the hell knows?
