Introduction

In this section, we consider the following question:

What could be a more basic tools to compute the negative order of the first and the second kind Euler numbers? One of the motivations is associated with this question and its answer. Especially, in the work of Golombek [\cite=golombek], which is entitled Aufgabe 1088, we see the following novel combinatorial sum:

[formula]

where [formula]. Golombek [\cite=golombek] also mentioned that this sum is related to the following sequence

The other motivation is to introduce new families of special numbers, which are not only used in counting techniques and problems, but also computing negative order of the first and the second kind Euler numbers and other combinatorial sums. Here, our technique is related to the generating functions. In the historical development of Mathematics, we can observe that the generating functions play a very important role in Pure and Applied Mathematics. These function are powerful tools to solve counting problems and investigate properties of the special numbers and polynomials. In addition, the generating functions are also used in Computer Programming, in Physics, and in other areas. Briefly, in Physics, generating functions, which arise in Hamiltonian mechanics, are quite different from generating functions in mathematics. The generating functions are functions whose partial derivatives generate the differential equations that determine a system's dynamics. These functions are also related to the partition function of statistical mechanics (cf. [\cite=Charamb], [\cite=Knuth], [\cite=M._Spiegel], [\cite=Wm], [\cite=Wp]). As for mathematics, a generating function is a formal power series in one indeterminate whose coefficients encode information about a sequence of numbers and that is indexed by the natural numbers (cf. [\cite=Charamb], [\cite=Comtet], [\cite=Doubilet], [\cite=Grademir], [\cite=Knuth], [\cite=M._Spiegel], [\cite=Rainville], [\cite=SrivastavaBook], [\cite=Wm]). As far as we know that the generating function is firstly discovered by Abraham de Moivre (26 May 1667 -27 November 1754, French mathematician) (cf. [\cite=Knuth], [\cite=Wm]). In order to solve the general linear recurrence problem, Moivre constructed the concept of the generating functions in 1730. In work of Doubilet et al. [\cite=Doubilet], we also see that Laplace (23 March 1749-5 March 1827, French mathematician, physicist and statistician), discovered the remarkable correspondence between set theoretic operations and operations on formal power series. Their method gives us great success to solve a variety of combinatorial problems. They developed new kinds of algebras of generating functions better suited to combinatorial and probabilistic problems. Their method is depended on group algebra (or semigroup algebra) (see for detail [\cite=Doubilet]). It is well-known that there are many different ways or approaches to generate a sequence of numbers and polynomials from the series or the generating functions. The purpose of this paper is to construct the generating functions for new families of numbers involving Golombek's identity in ([\ref=Gl]), the Stirling numbers, the central factorial numbers, the Euler numbers of negative order, the rook numbers and combinatorial sums. Our method and approach provides a way of constructing new special families of numbers and combinatorial sums. We show how several of these numbers and these combinatorial sums relate to each other.

We summarize our paper results as follows:

In Section 2, we briefly review some special numbers and polynomials, which are the Bernoulli numbers, the Euler numbers, the Stirling numbers, the central factorial numbers and the array polynomials.

In Section 3, we give a generating function. By using this function, we define a family of new numbers y1(n,k;λ). We investigate many properties including a recurrence relation of these numbers by using their generating functions. We compute a few values of the numbers y1(n,k;λ), which are given by the tables. We give some remarks and comments related to the Golombek's identity and the numbers y1(n,k;1). Finally, we give a conjecture with two open questions.

In Section 4, we give a generating function for a new family of the other numbers y2(n,k;λ). By using this function, we investigate many properties with a recurrence relation of these numbers. We compute a few values of the numbers y2(n,k;λ), which are given by the tables. We give relations between these numbers, the Fibonacci numbers, the Lucas numbers, and the λ-Stirling numbers of the second kind. We also give some combinatorial sums.

In Section 5, we define λ-central factorial numbers C(n,k;λ). By using their generating functions, we derive some identities and relations for these numbers and the others.

In Section 6, we give some applications related to the special values of mathematical expectation for the binomial distribution, the Bernstein polynomials and the Bernoulli polynomials.

In Section 7, by using the numbers y1(n,k;λ), we compute the Euler numbers of negative order. In addition, we compute a few values of these numbers, which are given by the tables.

In Section 8, We give two algorithms for our computations.

In Section 9, we give some combinatorial applications, including a rook numbers and polynomials. We also give combinatorial interpretation for the numbers y1(n,k). Finally in the last section, we give further remarks with conclusion.

Notations: Throughout this paper, we use the following standard notations:

Here, [formula] denotes the set of integers, [formula] denotes the set of real numbers and [formula] denotes the set of complex numbers. The principal value ln z is the logarithm whose imaginary part lies in the interval ( - π,π]. Moreover we also use the following notational conventions:and(cf. [\cite=Bayad], [\cite=Comtet], [\cite=SrivastavaChoi2012]). For combinatorial example, we will use the notations of Bona [\cite=Bona], that is the set [formula] is an n-element set, that is, n distinct objects. Therefore, Bona introduced the shorter notation

Background

In this section, we give a brief introduction about the Bernoulli numbers, the Euler numbers, the (λ-)Stirling numbers and the array polynomials. Because we use these numbers and polynomials in the next sections.

In [\cite=Alayont]-[\cite=Qi], we see that there are many known properties and relations involving various kind of the special numbers and polynomials such as the Bernoulli polynomials and numbers, the Euler polynomials and numbers, the Stirling numbers and also the rook polynomials and numbers by making use of some standard techniques based upon generating functions and other known techniques.

[\cite=DSkim1], [\cite=Grademir], [\cite=Ozden], [\cite=Ozden_AML], [\cite=Ryoo], [\cite=SrivastavaBook], [\cite=Qi]). Substituting k = λ = 1 into ([\ref=Cad3]), we have the first kind Euler numbers En = E(1)n(1), which are defined by means of the following generating function:where [formula] (cf. [\cite=Grademir]-[\cite=Qi]; see also the references cited in each of these earlier works).

The Euler numbers of the second kind [formula] are defined by means of the following generating function:where [formula] (cf. [\cite=Byrd], [\cite=Grademir], [\cite=Ozden_AML], [\cite=Ryoo], [\cite=SrivastavaChoi2012], [\cite=Qi]; see also the references cited in each of these earlier works).

The Stirling numbers of the second kind are used in pure and applied Mathematics. These numbers occur in combinatorics and in the theory of partitions. The Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted by S2(n,k), is the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k groups ([\cite=Bona], [\cite=Cigler], [\cite=Comtet], [\cite=M._Spiegel], [\cite=SrivastavaChoi2012]).

The λ-Stirling numbers of the second kind S2(n,v;λ) are generalized of the Stirling number of the second kind. These numbers S2(n,v;λ) are defined by means of the following generating function:

A Recurrence relation for these numbers is given bywithand S2(n,k) = 0 (n < k or k < 0) (cf. [\cite=Grademir]-[\cite=Qi]; see also the references cited in each of these earlier works).

[\cite=Chan], [\cite=SimsekFPTA], [\cite=AM2014]; see also the references cited in each of these earlier works).

Recently, the central factorial numbers T(n,k) have been studied by many authors. These functions have been many applications in theory of Combinatorics and Probability. The central factorial numbers T(n,k) (of the second kind) are defined by means of the following generating function:

[formula]

(cf. [\cite=Bona], [\cite=Cigler], [\cite=Comtet], [\cite=SrivastavaLiu], [\cite=AM2014], [\cite=M._Spiegel]; see also the references cited in each of these earlier works).

These numbers have the following relations:Combining the above equation with ([\ref=C1]), we also havewhere n  ≥  1, k  ≥  1, (n,k)  ≠  (1,1). For n, [formula], T(0,k) = T(n,0) = 0 and T(n,1) = 1 (cf. [\cite=Bona], [\cite=Cigler], [\cite=Comtet], [\cite=SrivastavaLiu], [\cite=AM2014], [\cite=M._Spiegel]).

A family of new numbers [formula]

In this section, we give generating function for the numbers y1(n,k;λ). We give some functional equations and differential equations of this generating function. By using these equations, we derive various new identities and combinatorics relations related to these numbers. Some our observations on these numbers can be briefly expressed as follows: the numbers y1(n,k;λ) are related to the λ-Stirling numbers of the second kind, the central factorial numbers, the Euler numbers of negative orders and the Golombek's identity.

Algorithms and Computation

Computer science and Applied Mathematics have study information and computation and also their theoretical foundations. In these areas practical techniques are very important (cf. [\cite=Wpc]). Therefore algorithmic processes play a very important role in both areas. Thus, in this section, we give two algorithms for the computation of the numbers y1(n,k;λ) and y2(n,k;λ).

Combinatorial applications and further remarks

In this section, we discuss some combinatorial interpretations of these numbers, as well as the generalization of the central factorial numbers given in Section 3-5. These interpretations includes the rook numbers and polynomials and combinatorial interpretation for the numbers y1(n,k). We see that our numbers are associated with known counting problems. By using counting techniques and generating functions techniques, Bona [\cite=Bona] rederived several known properties and novel relations involving enumerative combinatorics and related areas. A very interesting further special cases of the numbers B(n,k) is worthy of note by the work of Bona [\cite=Bona]. That is, in [\cite=Bona], Bona gave the following two exercises which are associated with the numbers B(n,k):

Exercise 3. Find the number of ways to place n rooks on an n  ×  n chess board so that no two of them attack each other.

Exercise 4. How many ways are there to place some rooks on an n  ×  n chess board so that no two of them attack each other?

Our numbers occur in combinatorics applications. In [\cite=Bona], Bona gave detailed and descriptive solution of these two exercises, which are related to the numbers B(n,k), respectively as follows:

There has to be one rook in each column. The first rook can be anywhere in its column (n possibilities). The second rook can be anywhere in its column except in the same row where the first rook is, which leaves n - 1 possibilities. The third rook can be anywhere in its column, except in the rows taken by the first and second rook, which leaves n - 2 possibilities, and so on, leading to [formula] possibilities.

Exercise 4. If we place k rooks, then we first need to choose the k columns in which these rooks will be placed. We can do that in [formula] ways. Continuing the line of thought of the solution of the previous exercise, we can then place our k rooks into the chosen columns in (n)k ways. Therefore, the total number of possibilities is

In ([\ref=Ci8]), for j < d, it is well-known thatTherefore, we arrive at solutions of Exercise 16 (a) in [\cite=Bona] and also Exercise 10 [\cite=Charamb] as follows:

Conclusions

In this paper, we have constructed some new families of special numbers with their generating functions. We give many properties of these numbers. These numbers are related to the many well-known numbers, which are the Bernoulli numbers, the Stirling numbers of the second kind, the central factorial numbers and also related to the Golombek's problem [\cite=golombek] Aufgabe 1088 . We have discussed some combinatorial interpretations of these numbers. Besides, we give some applications about not only rook polynomials and numbers, but also combinatorial sum.
