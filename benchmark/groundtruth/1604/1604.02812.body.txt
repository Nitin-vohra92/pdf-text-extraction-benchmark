C*-convexity of norm unit balls

Introduction

Throughout this paper assume that [formula] is the C*-algebra of all bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space H and I denotes the identity operator on H. If dim H = n, then we identify [formula] with [formula], the C*-algebra of all n  ×  n matrices with complex entries. We mean by [formula] the *  -algebra of all trace class operators on H.

A subset [formula] of [formula] is called C*-convex if [formula] and [formula] with [formula] implies that [formula]. This kind of convexity has been introduced by Loebl and Paulsen [\cite=Loebl] as a non-commutative generalization of the linear convexity. For example the sets [formula] and [formula] are C*-convex. It is evident that the C*-convexity of a set [formula] in [formula] implies its convexity in the usual sense. But the converse is not true in general. Various examples and some basic properties of C*-convex sets were presented in [\cite=Loebl].

In recent decades, many operator algebraists paid their attention to extend various concepts to non-commutative cases. Regarding these works, the notion of C*-convexity in C*-algebras has been established as a non-commutative generalization of the linear convexity in linear spaces. Some essential results of convexity theory have been generalized in [\cite=EW] to C*-convexity. In particular, a version of the so-called Hahn-Banach theorem was presented. The operator extension of extreme points, the C*-extreme points have also been introduced and studied, see [\cite=F] [\cite=FM] [\cite=FZ] [\cite=Hop] [\cite=Loebl] [\cite=M]. Moreover, Magajna [\cite=Magajna] established the notion of C*-convexity for operator modules and proved some separation theorems. We refer the reader to [\cite=Morenz] [\cite=Magajna2] [\cite=WW] for further results concerning C*-convexity.

The main aim of the present work is to determine those norms whose unit ball is C*-convex (and their dual norms). We call them M-norms.

In Section 2 we introduce M-norms and L-norms and give their properties and connections between.

In Section 3, we will show that "the class of L-norms which are greater than an arbitrary norm [formula], enjoys a minimum element" and "the class of M-norms which are less than an arbitrary norm [formula], possesses a minimum element". We determine this minimum and maximum elements in some cases. For example, we will show that the trace norm [formula] is the minimum element in the class of L-norms greater than the operator norm [formula].

In Section 4, we give a constructive result to obtain M-norms.

M-type and L-type Norms

Let [formula] be a norm on [formula] such that its unit ball [formula] is C*-convex. Then

[formula]

which further implies that

[formula]

since [formula] for all [formula]. On the other hand, if the equation [\eqref=c1] holds, then for all [formula] and [formula] with [formula] we obtain [formula] and so [formula] is C*-convex. Let us give a name to such norms.

We say that a norm [formula] on [formula] is a M-norm (is of M-type) if the equation [\eqref=c1] holds true.

The motivation of the next definition will be revealed soon.

We say that a norm [formula] on [formula] is a L-norm (is of L-type) if

[formula]

The discussion above yields that:

Let [formula] be a norm on [formula]. The unit ball of [formula] is C*-convex if and only if [formula] is a M-norm.

The operator norm (spectral norm) [formula] is a M-norm. It is well-known that (see for example [\cite=Bhatia])

[formula]

Let [formula] with [formula]. If [formula] [formula], then

[formula]

Hence, [formula] and so, the unit ball of [formula] is C*-convex. Lemma [\ref=lem1] now implies that [formula] is a M-norm.

The dual space of [formula] is identified with [formula] itself under the duality coupling

[formula]

Here, it should be noticed that

[formula]

The dual norm [formula] of a norm [formula] is defined as

[formula]

The next theorem provides a condition under which the unit ball of the dual norm [formula] of a norm [formula] on [formula] is C*-convex.

Let [formula] be the dual norm of a norm [formula] on [formula]. The unit ball of [formula] is C*-convex if and only if [formula] is a L-norm.

The unit ball of [formula] is the set

[formula]

Assume that [formula] is C*-convex, [formula] and [formula]. For every [formula], the definition [\eqref=dn] guarantees the existence of [formula] such that [formula] and [formula]. It follows from the C*-convexity of [formula] that [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

i.e., the condition [\eqref=cd] is valid and so [formula] is a L-norm.

For the converse, assume that [\eqref=cd] holds. Assume that [formula] and [formula] with [formula]. It follows

[formula]

Hence, If [formula], then

[formula]

Therefore, [formula] and so [formula] is C*-convex.

The connection between M-norms and L-norms is stated below.

A norm [formula] on [formula] is a M-norm (resp. L-norm) if and only if its dual norm [formula] is a L-norm (resp. M-norm).

Suppose that [formula] is a M-norm. Take [formula]. Let [formula] [formula] with [formula]. For every [formula], it follows from [\eqref=dn] that there exists [formula] with [formula] and

[formula]

Since [formula] is of M-type, [formula], so that

[formula]

Therefore, [formula] is a L-norm.

Suppose conversely that the dual norm [formula] is a L-norm. If [formula] [formula] and [formula], then there exits [formula] such that

[formula]

We have

[formula]

where the last inequality follows from the fact that [formula] is a L-norm. This completes the proof.

We can summarize the above discussion as: If [formula] is the dual norm of a norm [formula] on [formula] and [formula] and [formula] are the unit ball of [formula] and [formula], respectively, then

[formula]

and

[formula]

The trace norm [formula] defined on [formula] by [formula] is a L-norm. Since [formula] is the dual norm of the operator norm, Example [\ref=spn] and Lemma [\ref=lem2] imply that [formula] is a L-norm.

Let [formula] be a norm on [formula]. There are M-norms [formula] and [formula] and L-norms [formula] and [formula] such that [formula] and [formula]. Since all norms on [formula] are equivalent, there are α,β,μ,ν > 0 such that [formula] and [formula]. It is enough to define [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula].

Recall that a norm [formula] on [formula] is said to be unitarily invariant if [formula] for all [formula] and all unitaries [formula], while it is called weakly unitarily invariant if [formula] for every [formula] and every unitary [formula]. It is easy to see that all M-norms and L-norms on [formula] are weakly unitarily invariant. Moreover, let E be a projection in [formula]. If [formula] is a M-norm, then [\eqref=c1] gives

[formula]

and if [formula] is a L-norm, then [\eqref=cd] implies

[formula]

We will use this fact:

If [formula] is a L-norm or is a M-norm, then [formula] for every projection E and every [formula].

Let [formula] be a norm on [formula].

If [formula] is a M-norm, then there exists α > 0 such that [formula] for every normal element [formula].

If [formula] is a L-norm, then there exists α > 0 such that [formula] for every normal element [formula].

Note that if [formula] is a M-norm or is a L-norm, then it is weakly unitarily invariant. Moreover, every two rank-one orthoprojections P and Q in [formula] are unitarily equivalent, i.e., there exists a unitary U such that P = U*QU. It follows that [formula].

Now, if [formula] is normal, then by the spectral theorem, there are orthoprojections Ei and [formula]  [formula] such that

[formula]

Noticing that [formula] for every [formula], we set [formula]. (1) If [formula] is a M-norm, then

[formula]

where the last inequality follows from Lemma [\ref=lem5]. In addition, Since [formula] is a M-norm, we have

[formula]

This completes the proof of (1). (2)  If [formula] is a L-norm, then

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

since [formula] is a L-norm.

Let [formula] be a unitarily invariant norm on [formula].

If [formula] is a M-norm, then [formula] for some α > 0.

If [formula] is a L-norm, then [formula] for some α > 0.

Indeed, if [formula] is unitarily invariant, then for every [formula] we have [formula] by the polar decomposition. Proposition [\ref=th22] then can be applied.

It follows from the proof of Proposition [\ref=th22] that if a norm [formula] on [formula] is weakly unitarily invariant, then [formula] for every two rank-one orthoprojections E1 and E2. If [formula] is a weakly unitarily invariant norm, then we set [formula], where E is any rank-one orthoprojection. Let ω(  ·  ) and ω*(  ·  ) denote the numerical radius (norm) and its dual norm, respectively.

Let [formula] be a weakly unitarily invariant norm with [formula].

If [formula] is a M-norm, then [formula].

If [formula] is a L-norm, then [formula].

(1)  First take A with [formula]. For any unit vector [formula], put E: = xx*. Since [formula], and EAE = 〈x,Ax〉E, we have

[formula]

so that [formula]. Next, take B with [formula]. It is known that B can be written as a convex combination of two unitaries, i.e., B = λU + (1 - λ)V for some λ∈[0,1] and two unitaries U and V. We know that every unitary matrix has norm 1 for any M-norm [formula] with [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

(2) If [formula] is a L-norm, then [formula] is a M-norm. Moreover, [formula]. Part (1) now implies that [formula]. Finally, duality of norms reveals that [formula].

Minimum norms of L-type and maximum norms of M-type

In this section we are going to show that the class of L-norms enjoys a minimum element.

The class of L-norms on [formula] grater than a given norm possesses a minimum element.

Let [formula] be a norm on [formula]. Define a norm [formula] by

[formula]

It is clear that [formula] becomes a norm greater than [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula]. By definition [\eqref=u], for every 0 < ε < 1 and for every [formula], there exist Cij such that

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we have by [\eqref=u] that

[formula]

Hence [formula] by [\eqref=me1] and [\eqref=me2]. Letting ε  →  0 we conclude that [formula] is a L-norm.

Finally, let [formula] be a L-norm and greater than [formula]. If [formula] and [formula], then

[formula]

Now definition [\eqref=u] implies that [formula]. Therefore, [formula] is the minimum element.

The class of M-norms on [formula] less than a given norm [formula] possesses a minimum element.

Set

[formula]

and

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=th11] implies that [formula] has a minimum element, say [formula]. Duality of norms and Lemma [\ref=lem2] ensure that [formula] is a M-norm. Moreover, [formula] is the maximum element of [formula] by definition.

Consider the operator norm on [formula]. Theorem [\ref=th11] guarantees that the class of L-norms grater than the operator norm has a minimum element. In the next result we show that the trace norm [formula] is the minimum one along the class of L-norms bounded below by the operator norm.

The trace norm [formula] is the minimum element in the class of L-norms greater than the operator norm [formula], i.e.,

[formula]

For any matrix [formula] and every orthonormal system xj [formula] we can write

[formula]

in which Ej is the rank-one orthoprojection to [formula]. Moreover, assume that A = U|A| be the polar decomposition of A with unitary U. Then

[formula]

Let

[formula]

be the spectral decomposition of unitary U*, where xj's are the (column) unit eigenvectors ( so that x*j's are row vectors and xjx*j = Ej is the rank-one projection onto the subspace [formula]). Now, it follows from [\eqref=e10] and [\eqref=e11] that

[formula]

This implies that

[formula]

Therefore, they are all equal and the proof is complete.

We give another example for Theorem [\ref=th11] in the next theorem.

The trace norm [formula] is the minimum element in the class of L-norms greater than the numerical radius norm ω(  ·  ).

Assume that [formula] is a L-norm with [formula]. For every [formula], there exits an orthonormal system of vectors {xj} such that

[formula]

where Ej = xjx*j. This ensures that [formula] is the minimum L-norm greater than the numerical radius norm.

The operator norm [formula] is the maximum element in the class of M-norms smaller than ω*(  ·  ), the dual norm of ω(  ·  ).

Apply Corollary [\ref=co11] and Theorem [\ref=th33].

A natural question is that does the class of L-norms [formula] which are less than a norm [formula] contain a maximum element? or does the class of M-norms [formula] which are greater than a norm [formula] contain a minimum element?

We answer these questions in some special cases below. First we need the following simple lemma.

If P and Q are orthoprojections in [formula], then

[formula]

for every [formula].

First note that [formula] for every [formula] and every unitary U. If P and Q are orthoprojections in [formula], then [formula] is a unitary in [formula]. If [formula], then

[formula]

Put [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=q1] and [\eqref=q2] and [\eqref=q3] that

[formula]

This completes the proof.

The norm n  ·  ω(  ·  ) is the minimum element in the class of M-norm greater than the trace norm [formula].

Note first that the unit ball of the numerical radius norm ω(  ·  ) is C*-convex [\cite=Loebl] and so ω(  ·  ) is a M-norm. For every [formula] there exists an orthonormal system of vectors {xj}nj = 1 of [formula] such that [formula]. So, n ω(  ·  ) is a M-norm greater than the trace norm [formula].

Now let [formula] be a M-norm greater than the trace norm. For any [formula], there is [formula] such that [formula] and ω(A) = |〈x,Ax〉|. Starting with x1: = x, construct a coordinate orthonormal system {xj} in [formula]. Assume that Uj is the unitary such that Ujxj = x. Let Ej: = xjx*j be the rank-one orthoprojection to [formula]. Note that

[formula]

Since [formula] is weakly unitary invariant and [formula], we have

[formula]

This proves that n  ·  ω(  ·  ) is the minimum element.

The norm [formula] is the maximum element in the class of L-norms smaller than the operator norm [formula].

This follows from Theorem [\ref=th44] via duality of corresponding norms.

Construction of M-norms and L-norms

If f:(0,  ∞  )  →  (0,  ∞  ) is an operator concave function, the Jensen's operator inequality [\cite=HP] implies that

[formula]

for all [formula] and [formula] with [formula].

Assume that φ(t),ψ(t) > 0 are matrix concave functions on (0,1). The set

[formula]

is C*-convex.

Let [formula] with [formula]. If [formula], then there exist [formula] with 0  ≤  Ai  ≤  I [formula] such that [formula], for all [formula]. It follows that

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

It is easy to see that the function [formula] is jointly convex. Hence

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=c3] and [\eqref=c4] we get

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

Noting that [formula], we then conclude that [formula].

Theorem [\ref=mt] provides a way of constructing M-norms. If we find any norm such that its unit ball coincide with Uφ,ψ for some proper matrix concave functions φ and ψ, then that norm would be a M-norm by Lemma [\ref=lem1]. An obvious example is the spectral norm [formula] whose unit ball coincide with Uφ,ψ, where φ(t) = ψ(t) = 1, since

[formula]

As another example consider the numerical radius norm ω(  ·  ). It is known that [\cite=Bhatia] that for [formula], ω(X)  ≤  1 if and only if there exists a Hermitian matrix H with - I  ≤  H  ≤  I such that [formula] is positive.

With [formula] this concludes that 0  ≤  A  ≤  I and

[formula]

If φ(t) = 2t and ψ(t) = 2(1 - t), then φ and ψ are matrix concave functions on (0,1). Theorem [\ref=mt] then ensures the C*-convexity of U2t,2(1 - t). In addition, [formula] by [\eqref=q112]. This implies that the numerical radius norm ω(  ·  ) is a M-norm.
