Positive maps which map the set of rank k projections onto itself

One form of the celebrated Wigner s theorem [\cite=4W] is that if φ is a linear map of the bounded operators B(H) on a Hilbert space H into itself with the property that it maps the set of rank 1 projections bijectively onto itself, then φ is of the form

[formula]

where at is the transpose of a with respect to a fixed orthonormal basis for H, and U is a unitary operator. In the paper [\cite=Sa] Sarbicki, Chruscinski and Mozrzymas generalized this to the case when H is of finite dimension n with n a prime number, and the set of rank 1 projections is replaced by rank k projections, where k is a natural number strictly smaller than n. They gave a counter example to the conclusion (*) when n is not a prime. In that case φ is no longer a positive map. In the present note we make the extra assumption that φ is a positive unital map. Then for any Hilbert space we obtain the conclusion (*). Closely related results have been obtained by Molnar [\cite=M].

Recall that an atomic masa in B(H) is a maximal abelian subalgebra A generated by the rank 1 projections corresponding to the vectors in an orthonormal basis for H. Thus if H is finite dimensional each maximal abelian subalgebra is atomic. We start with a lemma. See also [\cite=M], Lemma 2.1.5.

Let p∈B(H) be a rank 1 projection and A an atomic masa in B(H) containing p. Let k be a natural number, k  <   dim H. Then there exist k + 1 projections P1,...,Pk + 1 in A such that

[formula]

Proof.  Let p1 = p,p2,...,pk + 1 be mutually orthogonal rank 1 projections in A. Let

[formula]

Then Pj is a projection of rank k, and pi  ≤  Pj for all j  ≠  i, so pi  ≤  Pj for k of the projections Pj. It is therefore an easy computation to show the above formula. The proof is complete.

Let φ be a positive unital map of B(H) into itself such that φ maps the set of projections of rank k in B(H),k < dimH, onto itself. Then φ is of the form (*).

Proof.  Since each projection of rank k in B(H) is in the image under φ of a rank k projection, it follows from Lemma 1 that the rank 1 projections are in image of φ, hence each finite rank operator is in the image of the finite rank operators. By continuity of φ it follows that φ when restricted to the compact operators C(H), maps C(H) onto a norm dense subset of itself.

The definite set D of φ is the set of self-adjoint operators a such that φ(a2)  =  φ(a)2. Let Q be a projection of rank k; then P  =  φ(Q) is a projection of rank k, hence

[formula]

so that Q∈D. By [\cite=St], Proposition 2.1.7, D is a norm closed Jordan subalgebra of B(H), so by the same argument as above [formula] , the self-adjoint operators in C(H). Furthermore, the restriction of φ to D is a Jordan homomorphism. Since C(H) is irreducible, by [\cite=S], Corollary 3.4, φ is either a homomorphism or an anti-homomorphism on C(H). But C(H) is a simple C*-algebra, so φ is either an automorphism or an anti-automorphism of C(H).

Let now ωx be a vector state on B(H). Then if p is the rank 1 projection onto the 1-dimensional subspace of H generated by x , then for a∈B(H),

[formula]

Since φ is a Jordan automorphism of C(H) there is a unit vector y such that if q is the rank 1 projection onto the subspace spanned by y, then φ(q)  =  p. Thus for a∈B(H), since q∈D, we have, using [\cite=St], Proposition 2.1.7,

[formula]

We have thus shown that each vector state composed with φ is a vector state. Hence by [\cite=St] ,Theorem 3.3.2 φ is of the desired form (*). The proof is complete.
