Effective widths and integrated cross sections for two-photon transitions in 178Hf

The possibility to produce an increase of the activity of an isomeric sample by irradiating the sample with a laser pulse and the x-ray pumping of nuclear transitions have been discussed some time ago. [\cite=1] We have studied recently the rates for two-photon transitions from isomeric states to given final states, induced by an incident flux of photons having a continuous energy distribution. [\cite=2],[\cite=3]

In this work we have calculated integrated cross sections for two-photon processes in 178Hf. The calculations are based on tabulated nuclear data. [\cite=4] We have assumed that the nucleus is initially in a state |i〉 of energy Ei and spin Ji, which in general is different from the isomeric state. By absorbing an incident photon of energy Eni, the nucleus makes a transition to a higher intermediate state |n〉 of energy En, spin Jn and half-life tn. The state |n〉 then decays into a lower state |l〉 of energy El and spin Jl by the emission of a gamma-ray photon having the energy Enl or by internal conversion. In some cases the state |l〉 may be situated above the initial state |i〉, and in these cases the transition |n〉  →  |l〉 is followed by further gamma-ray transitions to lower states.

We have analyzed two-photon transitions in 178Hf for which there is an intermediate state |n〉 of known energy En, spin Jn and half-life tn, for which the intermediate state is connected by a known gamma-ray transition to the initial state |i〉 and to a lower state |l〉, and for which the relative intensities [formula] of the transitions to lower states are known.

The cross sections are summed over all lower states |l〉 which are possible for a given pair of initial and intermediate states |i〉,|n〉. The integrated cross sections are calculated as

[formula]

and where Eni = En - Ei. The quantity Γeff is the effective width of the two-photon transition,

[formula]

where tn is the half-life of the intermediate state |n〉, and the dimensionless quantity FR has the expression

[formula]

In Eq. ([\ref=4]), [formula] are the internal conversion coefficients for the transitions [formula].

The effective widths Γtoteff and the integrated cross sections σtotint are given in Table I. The multipolarities of the transitions are given in columns ni and nl. The largest integrated cross section found among the listed 24 two-photon processes in 178Hf has the value 1.65  ×  10- 26 cm2 keV. If the initial state is the isomeric state at Ei=2446 keV, the nuclear parameters required for the calculation of the two-photon integrated cross section are known at present only for the intermediate state at En=2573 keV.
