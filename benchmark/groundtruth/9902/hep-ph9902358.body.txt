Exact Parametrization of Majorana Neutrino Mass Matrix with Large Mixing   and A. Takamura Department of Physics, Nagoya University Nagoya 464-8602, Japan

Introduction

The finite mass of neutrinos and the mixing among different flavor neutrinos have been suggested by various neutrino oscillation experiments. One of the major experiments is the solar neutrino experiments, which indicate the oscillation between νe and other neutrinos. Another one is the atmospheric neutrino experiments, which indicate the oscillations between νμ and other neutrinos.

In solar neutrino experiments three possible solutions are proposed: small or large mixing MSW solution [\cite=MSW] and vacuum oscillation solution with large mixing [\cite=VO]. Especially the small mixing MSW solution [\cite=SMSW]

[formula]

has been thought as the strong candidate compared with others for the solar neutrino problem. Furthermore νe  →  νμ oscillations are the most likely channel in ([\ref=43]) although other channels νe  →  ντ and νe  →  νs are not be excluded.

Another experiments are the atmospheric neutrino experiments. In particular, the recent report by Super-Kamiokande [\cite=K.F] concerned with a zenith-angle-dependent deficit of νμ suggests the strong evidence for neutrino oscillation with large mixing,

[formula]

Within the three neutrino picture, the atmospheric neutrino problem can be explained by νμ  →  ντ because νμ  →  νe is excluded by the CHOOZ experiment [\cite=CHOOZ]. In the near future it is expected that the data obtained by Super-Kamiokande, SNO, K2K and so on reveal the structure of the lepton sector more clearly.

At the moment, we recognize that the lepton sector is largely different from the quark sector in following two points. The first one is the large νμ  -  ντ mixing in contrast to quark sector. The second one is that the neutrino masses are extremely small compared with the quark and the charged lepton masses.

These differences seem to be explained by more fundamental theory. Actually, the smallness of neutrino masses can be naturally understood as the inverse of large Majorana neutrino masses by using seesaw mechanism [\cite=Y]. We can also consider that the large mixing is not originated from the charged lepton but from the Majorana neutrino. Because it is expected that the charged lepton mass matrix has the same structure as the quark one in the grand unified theory (GUT). In addition, it is expected that the contribution of the charged lepton to mixing angle is small at weak scale as well as GUT scale since the renormalization effects are small in general.

As one of the mass matrices which leads the small mixing, Fritzsch-type [\cite=F] mass matrix is proposed in the quark sector. It is given by imposing hermicity to the nearest-neighbor interactions (NNI) form, which has the components M11 = M13 = M31 = M22 = 0. One of approaches to explore the symmetry of more fundamental theory is to consider the simple mass matrices like this. In general Branco, Lavoura and Mota [\cite=B.L.M] proved that one can always choose the NNI form as both up and down quark mass matrices. This means that arbitrary mass matrices can be transformed into the NNI form which has the same physical quantities.

In this letter inspired by these works, we explore the simple form of Majorana neutrino mass matrix, Mν, which only contributes to the νμ  -  ντ mixing when we choose the NNI form as the charged lepton mass matrix Ml. As a result, we prove that one can always choose the following simple forms as Majorana neutrino mass matrix,

[formula]

where aν,bν,cν and dν are complex values and are represented by five independent parameters, and charged lepton mass matrix,

[formula]

where a,b,c,d and e are all real values. Twelve parameters are contained in Ml and Mν and just correspond to the physical quantities: three charged lepton masses, three neutrino masses, three mixing angles and three phases. Note that arbitrary Mν and Ml can be transformed into the simple forms ([\ref=1]) and ([\ref=2]) which have the same physical quantities.

These ([\ref=1]) and ([\ref=2]) are the exact parametrization of the lepton mass matrices. In this parametrization, there is no contributions to νe  -  νμ mixing from Mν but only from Ml. On the other hand, νμ  -  ντ mixing is contributed from both Ml and Mν. The large mixing can be generated only by Mν because the contribution from Ml is small. Thus, this parametrization is suitable for the physics with the small mixing MSW solution for solar neutrino problem and the large mixing solution for atmospheric neutrino problem.

In the following section we give the proof how to transform into ([\ref=1]) and ([\ref=2]). Next we start from ([\ref=1]) and ([\ref=2]), and calculate the Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (MNS) matrix [\cite=M.N.S], which represents lepton mixing matrix, under the assumptions used in the quark sector. Finally we check the validity of these assumptions from the experimental values.

Simple Form of Lepton Mass Matrices

In this section, starting from the arbitrary Majorana neutrino mass matrix Mν and the charged lepton Dirac mass matrix Ml, we transform the neutrino mass matrix into the simple form ([\ref=1]) and the charged lepton mass matrix into the NNI form ([\ref=2]) by using the following transformation

[formula]

The physical quantities calculated by (Mν,Ml) are not changed through the above transformation to [formula]. In general Mν is a 3  ×  3 complex symmetric matrix, which has 12 parameters and Ml is a 3  ×  3 complex matrix, which has 18 parameters. Taking advantage of freedom contained in U and V, the number of the parameters in Ml and Mν is reduced from 30 to 12. The remaining 12 parameters in Ml and Mν just correspond to the physical quantities.

At first let us show how to transform Ml into NNI form, which has the components [formula], based on the work done by Branco et al. [\cite=B.L.M]. Three conditions [formula] are satisfied by choosing the unitary matrix V = (Vi1,Vi2,Vi3) in ([\ref=4]) as

[formula]

where the N1 and N3 are normalization factors and M, [formula] are defined by

[formula]

Note that U is an arbitrary unitary matrix in ([\ref=32]) and ([\ref=29]). The vector Vi2 is determined by the orthogonality conditions with the vectors Vi1 and Vi3 as

[formula]

where the N2 is an also normalization factor. After the transformations ([\ref=27]) and ([\ref=28]), the matrix element [formula] turns to

[formula]

in terms of ([\ref=29]) and ([\ref=30]). The remaining condition for the NNI form is realized in [formula]. For the purpose, we impose U to satisfy the following condition,

[formula]

Next we transform the neutrino mass matrix Mν into the simple form ([\ref=1]). This is done by choosing U in ([\ref=3]) as

[formula]

These ([\ref=24]) and ([\ref=25]) are contended if U is satisfied in the following equation

[formula]

where N4 is an normalization factor. The solution Ui1 in this equation is obtained by U = (Ui1,Ui2,Ui3) which diagonalize [formula].

Once Ui1 is obtained, Ui2 is successively determined by the condition ([\ref=26]), and Ui3 is also determined by the orthogonality conditions with the other two vectors Ui1 and Ui2. The explicit forms of Ui2 and Ui3 are written with Ui1 as

[formula]

where N5 and N6 are normalization factors.

Finally we show that the number of parameters are reduced to 12 by the ambiguity of the six phases containing in the normalization factors of eigenstates Ui1,Ui2,Ui3 and Vi1,Vi2,Vi3. The redefinitions [formula] and [formula] do not change the forms of lepton mass matrices ([\ref=1]) and ([\ref=2]), where P(δν) and P(δR) are diagonal phase matrices. By these redefinitions, ([\ref=3]) and ([\ref=4]) become

[formula]

We can choose P(δν) so as to absorb three phases of [formula] and as a result one phase degree of freedom is only left in [formula]. Introducing another phase matrix P(δL) to separate the phase factor from [formula], we can rewrite ([\ref=31]) as

[formula]

where [formula] is a diagonal phase matrix and [formula] is a real symmetric matrix of NNI form [\cite=F] [\cite=I.T]. P(δL) and P(δR) can be chosen so that five phases of [formula] are absorbed.

By replacement [formula] with Mν and [formula] with Ml, we can always choose the lepton mass matrices as

[formula]

where mν3 and m3 are respectively the heaviest neutrino mass and the heaviest charged lepton mass and Mν is complex symmetric including only one phase degree of freedom implicitly in some components. In ([\ref=11]) we make (P(δ))11 = 1 using the remaining freedom in P(δL). Note that Mν and Ml can be chosen as ([\ref=12]) and ([\ref=11]) at any scale. As mentioned in the introduction, the above representation ([\ref=12]) of Mν only contributes to the νμ  -  ντ mixing. The lepton mass matrices ([\ref=12]) and ([\ref=11]) have twelve parameters including three phases and these parameters are just the same as the number of physical quantities.

Physical Quantities and Twelve Parameters

In this section, our purpose is to study the relations between the physical quantities and twelve parameters for the charged lepton mass matrix Ml of ([\ref=12]) and the neutrino mass matrix Mν of ([\ref=11]). The mass matrices ([\ref=12]) and ([\ref=11]) should generate correct mass eigenvalues. Introducing the three charged lepton mass eigenvalues for [formula] in ([\ref=35]) as input parameters, Ml, which has five free parameters at first, is parametrized by two free parameters. In the same way, Mν is also parametrized by two free parameters. Then, the remaining six free parameters (each of l,Mν and P(δ) has two parameters) can be determined by the MNS matrix denoted by VMNS, which should be fixed by the physical quantities,

[formula]

where Uν is the unitary matrix which diagonalize Mν and Ol is the orthogonal matrix which diagonalize T.

At first, let us consider the charged lepton mass matrix Ml. We apply the work for the quark sector done by Harayama and Okamura [\cite=H.O] to the lepton sector. T is a real symmetric matrix which can be diagonalized by orthogonal matrix Ol as [formula], where [formula] and mi(i = 1,2,3) are the charged lepton masses.

As the results, we can parametrize the charged lepton mass matrix as

[formula]

where the matrix elements b and d are expressed as

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

Thus, Ml has only two independent free parameters y and z.

The orthogonal matrix, Ol, which diagonalize T is also represented using only two independent free parameters as follows;

[formula]

where a = qz / y,c = q / (yz) and fi is normalization factor.

Next we consider the neutrino mass matrix Mν. [formula] should generate correct mass eigenvalues as [formula] by the unitary matrix Uν, where [formula] and mνi(i = 1,2,3) are the neutrino masses. In general the matrix [formula] can be parametrized without loss of generality as follows;

[formula]

using two parameters C and θ1 so that trace and determinant are invariant under unitary transformations. The above matrix can be diagonalized by

[formula]

where

[formula]

The neutrino mass matrix Mν reconstructed from Uν and Dν is

[formula]

where

[formula]

([\ref=15]) and ([\ref=16]) are the exact parametrization of the lepton mass matrices. These simple form can be obtained without any approximations.

Finally we obtain the MNS matrix by using ([\ref=11]), ([\ref=13]) and ([\ref=33]) as follows;

[formula]

where αi, βi and γi are expressed by y and z in ([\ref=13]).

In ([\ref=17]), six independent parameters, y,z,φ,θ1,θ2,θ3, are included. y, z, φ correspond to three mixing angles and θ1,θ2,θ3 correspond to three CP phases. If the contribution of the charged lepton mass matrix to νμ  -  ντ mixing is small, we can identify φ with the large νμ  -  ντ mixing angle.

The MNS Matrix

In this section, we investigate the structure of the MNS matrix under the approximation that the mass ratios of the charged leptons ξ1( = m1 / m3) and ξ2( = m2 / m3) are small quantities compared with ξ3  =  1( = m3 / m3). In addition, we adopt the assumptions y  ~  O(1),z  ~  O(1) in the charged lepton mass matrix Ml, based on the expectation that it has the same structure as the quark mass matrices, as mentioned in the introduction. We roughly estimate the values of y and z from the experimental values and check the validity of the above assumptions. Then, we also study the structure of neutrino mass matrix Mν under the condition that the maximal νμ  -  ντ mixing is derived from VMNS, in each case that neutrinos have hierarchical masses (ξν1  ≪  ξν2  ≪  1) or degenerate masses (ξν1  ~  ξν2  ~  1).

Let us start from the exact form of ([\ref=15]). The mass hierarchy of the charged leptons, ξ1  ≪  ξ2  ≪  1, and the assumptions, y  ~  O(1) and z  ~  O(1), lead to the results,

[formula]

and then substituting ([\ref=18]) for R in ([\ref=19]) and ([\ref=20]), we obtain either case I or case II, which is corresponding to the sign in front of R in ([\ref=19]) and ([\ref=20]),

[formula]

The case I and II have quite different structures at the following point. In the case I, d is a small quantity compared with b, oppositely in the case II, b is a small quantity compared with d. This leads to a different consequence for the mixing angle. Actually it is shown by Ref. [\cite=H.O.S.X] that the mass matrix leads to large mixing between the second and the third generations in the case I, in contrast it leads to small mixing in the case II. The case I is not consistent with our assumption that the charged lepton mass matrix has only small mixing. Therefore in the following discussion we only treat the case II and do not describe a detail calculation for the case I.

Next we adopt the assumption ([\ref=39]) in the MNS matrix [formula] of ([\ref=17]) and we obtain

[formula]

at leading order approximation. Here we roughly estimate the values of y and z from the experimental values and check the validity of the assumptions y  ~  O(1) and z  ~  O(1). Introducing the experimental values,

[formula]

and [formula] for the maximal νμ  -  ντ mixing, ([\ref=22]) becomes the following;

[formula]

up to phase factor of each matrix element. If y and z are fixed, we can determine the MNS matrix. As one of the examples, we obtain the MNS matrix in the case y = 0.90 and z = 0.62;

[formula]

This result is consistent with the best fit values [formula] and [formula] [\cite=CHOOZ] [\cite=G.N.P.V]. Therefore we recognize that the assumptions y  ~  O(1) and z  ~  O(1) are valid.

Finally we show the neutrino mass matrix Mν in each case that the neutrinos have hierarchical masses or degenerate masses.

In the case that the neutrinos have hierarchical masses (ξν1  ≪  ξν2  ≪  1),

[formula]

and in the case that the neutrinos have degenerate masses (ξν1  ~  ξν2  ~  1),

[formula]

These simple forms ([\ref=36]) and ([\ref=37]) of neutrino mass matrix are almost same from weak scale to GUT scale, since the renormalization effects are small as it is possible to be neglected except for the special cases [\cite=T]. The smallness of the renormalization effects is based on the fact that each element of the neutrino mass matrix change into the logarithm of the energy.

If ([\ref=36]) and ([\ref=37]) are originated from some symmetry of fundamental theory and these forms are ensured by this symmetry, it will become important to explore such symmetry as future works.

Summary

In conclusion we have proposed exact parametrization of the lepton mass matrices under the assumption that the neutrinos are Majorana particles. We have chosen the form which has no contribution to νe  -  νμ mixing as the neutrino mass matrix Mν and the NNI form as the charged lepton mass matrix Ml. This is the exact parametrization of the lepton mass matrices, which reflects the small νe  -  νμ mixing and the large νμ  -  ντ mixing.

Let us comment about the differences between quark and lepton case in short. At first the number of parameters is the same as the number of the physical quantities in the lepton case, so there remains no redundant parameters unlike the quark case [\cite=B.L.M]. Second, we cannot transform into NNI form both Mν and Ml at the same time although we can do in the quark case. Because the number of the parameters included in the mass matrices is smaller than the number of the physical quantities in the lepton case.

Our simple parametrization may be useful to find some symmetry from the new physics beyond the standard model. As future works there remains the problem to find such symmetry.
