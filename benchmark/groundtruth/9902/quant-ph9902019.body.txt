Introduction

A quantum elementary system is described by a complex wave field [formula] which, in the non-relativistic limit, satisfies the Schrödinger equation

[formula]

where H is the hamiltonian operator

[formula]

U being the (external) potential experienced by the system of mass m (in this paper we use natural units, in which     =    c    =    1). The complex equation ([\ref=11]) can be equivalently written as two real equations for the modulus R and the phase S of the function ψ:

[formula]

The last equation is usually referred to as the continuity equation for the probability density R2    =    |ψ|2. Instead, eq. ([\ref=13]) has the form of an Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the characteristic function S of a system described by an effective potential

[formula]

The term Q is called the "quantum potential"; it is the only non-classical term (i.e. proportional to the Planck constant) entering in the set of equations ([\ref=13]),([\ref=14]).

Recently, an important paper appeared [\cite=rs] in which Recami and Salesi give a straightforward interpretation of the quantum potential term. Starting from the Gordon decomposition (in the non-relativistic limit) of the Dirac current for a spin 1/2 particle, they have shown that the quantum potential term is strictly related to the spin of the particle and it can be derived from the kinetic energy associated with the internal zitterbewegung motion. This result puts new light on the whole interpretation of quantum mechanics.

However, the mentioned paper is too much related to spin 1/2 particles, so that more general conclusions cannot, in principle, be drawn.

In the present paper we generalize the Recami and Salesi result by starting only from the invariance properties of the field equations ([\ref=13]),([\ref=14]). The interpretation of the quantum potential as a kinetic energy for an internal motion is here achieved for a system of arbitrary spin. In section 2 a simple formalism is introduced in which the analysis of field equations is particularly useful for our purposes. This analysis is carried in section 3, in which the invariance properties of the equations of motion are studied; these naturally lead, in section 4, to the identification of an "internal motion" of the system, giving origin to the quantum potential. This identification is made possible by the presence of the spin, even if it is strictly related to its direction but not to its actual value (this property allows the generalization of Recami and Salesi result). In section 5 some "unusual" properties of the quantum potential are analyzed and it is shown that in the present interpretation they acquire a very simple meaning. Moreover, even if our result does not deal with the statistical [\cite=stat] or causal [\cite=holland] interpretation of quantum mechanics, it is nevertheless particularly useful in the context of the latter one. Then, in section 6 we reformulate the De Broglie - Bohm causal interpretation of quantum mechanics in the light of the obtained results. In particular, the consequences of the insurgence of an "internal motion" for a probabilistic interpretation are pointed out. Finally, in section 7 there are our conclusions and remarks.

Definition of the variables

Let us write the wave field in the polar representation

[formula]

with R,S two real functions. It is useful to introduce also

[formula]

Taking the logarithmic gradient of ([\ref=21]) one obtains

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Let us now define the following two fields:

[formula]

Both are adimensional quantities; by definition they are irrotational fields:

[formula]

Their mutual scalar and vector multiplication can be expressed in terms of the wave field in the following way, respectively

[formula]

Note that, even if [formula] is a multi-valued function (it is a phase), [formula] is a single-valued one. However, in nodal points, where ψ (and then R) vanishes, S is undefined, and so [formula]. In this case also equation ([\ref=28]) is no longer valid; a general expression can be found in [\cite=taka].

Dynamical properties

With the formalism settled in the previous section, we are now able to reconsider the Schrödinger equation ([\ref=11]) by starting, as in [\cite=rs], from the lagrangian for a non relativistic scalar particle:

[formula]

In terms of the fields [formula], [formula] we then have

[formula]

and from this, the equations of motion ([\ref=13]), ([\ref=14]) follow:

[formula]

with

[formula]

The equations of motion are invariant under the transformations

[formula]

(N and a being two constants). The first expresses the invariance under normalization change, while the second one correspond to a global phase transformation for the wave function

[formula]

Both have been extensively studied in the literature. Instead, let us concentrate on another transformation under which eq. ([\ref=34]) is left invariant:

[formula]

([formula] being an arbitrary vector field). Firstly, we observe that the field [formula] can be written, in general, as

[formula]

where [formula] is an arbitrary vector operator. However, here we will consider the most simple case in which [formula] is a constant multiplicative vector operator (independent on position), [formula], so that

[formula]

Denoting, for simplicity, [formula], we have then found that equation ([\ref=34]) is satisfied by taking

[formula]

[formula] being an arbitrary constant vector. So, the current density vector [formula] can always be written as

[formula]

but in general the velocity field [formula] has two terms:

[formula]

Identification of the vector [formula]

The vector [formula] entering in the expression for the current density is completely arbitrary, but it is suitable of a physical impressive interpretation in relation to the equation ([\ref=32]) for the lagrangian. In fact, let us postulate that [formula] in ([\ref=319]) is the absolute velocity of the system, and that (as in [\cite=rs]) the sum of the second and third term in ([\ref=32]) is nothing that the total kinetic energy of the system:

[formula]

With this choice, the vector [formula] is no longer arbitrary since, by

[formula]

the identification ([\ref=320]) is possible only if the following conditions are satisfied:

[formula]

These constraints show that [formula] has to be a unitary vector orthogonal to [formula], lying in the same plane of [formula], [formula] ; then it individuates only a direction (the versus remains unspecified). Moreover, we note that the picture emerging from the identification ([\ref=320]) leads us to consider [formula] as a property associated to the particle more than to the motion of it (it is, in some sense, on the same ground as the mass m, for example). But, from the isotropy of the space, the only privileged direction that can be associated with a particle is that of its spin. So, we see that the identification ([\ref=320]) has a physical meaning only if we identify the vector [formula] with the spin vector of the particle. Furthermore, the condition ([\ref=322]) allows us to consider valid this result whatever is the actual value of the spin of the particle; this feature is responsible of the generalization of Recami and Salesi result . Instead, the condition ([\ref=324]) expresses the fact that

[formula]

is the decomposition of the absolute velocity [formula] along [formula] and in the direction orthogonal to it. Remembering, then, that the angular momentum of a particle is always orthogonal to the velocity of the particle itself, we see that [formula] can be interpreted as the velocity associated to the spin angular momentum (note that from ([\ref=322]), ([\ref=323]) we have [formula]). The emerging picture is then the following: the motion of a quantum particle can be decomposed into an "external" motion, whose velocity field is [formula], and an "internal" one, driven by [formula]. The spin of the particle, whose direction is given by [formula], is the angular momentum associated to the internal motion. The kinetic energy of the system is simply given by the sum of the kinetic energies associated to the two (partial) motions.

As a corollary, we have also that the Schrödinger equation contains the spin of the given particle, but in a subtle way. In fact, it enters only in the description of the internal motion, but not in that of the external one; for the latter, as it is well known, we need multi-component wave functions (for example, a non-relativistic Pauli system is fully described by a two-component spinor) .

On the properties of the "quantum potential"

The quantum description of a given system can be carried out by the Schrödinger equation ([\ref=11]) or equivalently by the set of two coupled equations ([\ref=13]), ([\ref=14]). In the latter case, the pure quantum (non classical) effects are described by the quantum potential Q. Even if the two formulations are completely equivalent, the description in terms of an effective potential suffers for some "unusual" properties of the quantum potential itself (for a detailed discussion, see for example ref. [\cite=holland]); nevertheless, quantum phenomena are indeed "unusual", and this question is not very remarkable. Anyway, here we want to comment on the following three properties:

Classically-free motion is not, in general, a free motion in quantum mechanics, due to the presence of the quantum potential;

A classical (external) potential is a given function of the coordinates. Instead, the quantum potential is derived from the total quantum state of the system, so that an infinite number of different forms (associated with the same physical problem) can be generated by linearly superposing solutions of the Schrödinger equation;

The quantum potential is not altered by a change of the normalization factor of t he wave field ψ. The boundary condition ψ(x  →    ∞  )  →  0 does not necessarily imply that the quantum potential is ineffective at the infinity.

In the present interpretation, the pure quantum term is not properly a potential term; in fact, from ([\ref=35]) we have that

[formula]

and so it is completely determined by the velocity field [formula]. This point is a fundamental one: while the potential is an external property describing the physical system, a velocity derived energy is a property of the motion (in some sense, an intrinsic property) univocally determined once the external conditions (i.e. the potential and the initial conditions) are given. Hence, properties that can appear "unusual" for a potential term can nevertheless be peculiar for a kinetic term:

To the classical free motion corresponds the external quantum free motion (ruled by [formula]). Instead, the internal motion has no classical analog (being a pure quantum effect) and comes out from the presence of the spin;

The internal motion of the system has to depend on the total state of the system, being properly an intrinsic property. As well as the classical motion is univocally determined once the potential and the initial conditions are given, the complete quantum motion is univocally determined once both the external and the internal motion are given, i.e. once the potential, the initial conditions and the quantum state of the system are given;

The invariance under normalization change is a necessary condition for the present interpretation, since the internal motion (ruled by [formula], which is invariant) cannot depend on the choice of the normalization constant, that does not change the state of the system. Furthermore, the internal motion, being not directly related to external agents, can in general be non trivial also at the infinity.

Reformulation of the causal interpretation of quantum mechanics

The results obtained here does not involve the usual statistical [\cite=stat] or causal (De Broglie - Bohm) [\cite=holland] interpretation of quantum mechanics, so that they are independent of it. Nevertheless, they are very useful especially in the second frame; in this section we modify the usual assumptions of the causal theory to take into account the obtained results.

The starting point of the causal interpretation of quantum mechanics can be formulated as follows: if we need a complex wave function to describe a physical system, then it is reasonable to suppose that the wave function itself and not just its modulus (i.e. also its phase or quantities derived from this) has a direct physical meaning. In this view, the statistical interpretation of ψ (which is necessary, since it is in accord with the experimental facts) is not necessarily the only property which ψ itself carries; the wave function can indeed have a more potent role in the dynamics of a quantum system . The fundamental assumptions of the causal quantum theory of motion are the following (see [\cite=holland] for a general discussion):

A physical system is described by a physical complex-valued field [formula] which is solution of the Schrödinger equation;

[formula] is the probability that a particle described by the field [formula] lies between the points [formula] and [formula] at time t;

The velocity of the particle is given by

[formula]

The particle motion is univocally determined from the equation [formula] once the initial conditions

[formula]

are given. The initial velocity of the particle is [formula].

In the light of the results obtained here, it seems simple and straightforward to generalize the previous assumptions by changing the third postulate as follows:

The absolute velocity of the particle is given by

[formula]

where the "drift velocity" is

[formula]

while the "relative velocity" is [formula] with

[formula]

and [formula] is the spin direction of the particle (internal angular momentum). The total motion of the particle is made of an "external" motion, given by [formula], and an "internal" one, given by [formula]. It is univocally determined once the initial conditions

[formula]

are given. The initial (total) velocity of the particle is

[formula]

Let us observe that in the "old" formulation the knowledge of [formula] determined only the initial probability distribution, while here it directly determines also the initial velocity.

Now, the point is: in which way the reformulation of the third postulate is realized? Let us briefly discuss how the imposition of the initial conditions determines the motion of the particle, Solving the Schrödinger equation and imposing the initial condition [formula], the functions [formula] and [formula] are exactly determined. From these, the fields [formula], [formula] and then [formula] can be built up. Then imposing also the condition [formula], one can exactly know the dynamical trajectory [formula] from the equation

[formula]

Once [formula] is exactly know, also the velocities [formula], [formula], and then [formula] are univocally determined. Instead, the dynamical trajectories of the external and internal motion, given by

[formula]

[formula]

cannot be exactly known, since from the only initial condition

[formula]

it is not possible to deduce [formula], [formula]. Then, in the present reformulation the external and internal motions are not exactly determined (we can obtain a family of possible motions, but not the actual motion): only the complete motion can be univocally determined.

But a question arises: what is the initial condition that one can deduce from experiments? Is it really possible to assign [formula] in ([\ref=64])?

In the "old" causal formulation, the internal motion was not considered and the description of the (total) motion was given in terms of an effective potential; the initial condition was imposed on [formula], coinciding (there) with [formula]. It is reasonable to assume that the initial condition can be assigned (for several experimental accidents) only on the external motion (which is, in some sense) the mean motion of the particle), but not on the complete motion. It is therefore interesting to see what happens by keeping this point of view. A direct consequence of this assumption, and of the fact that S,R depend on [formula] but not on [formula] (as well as [formula], [formula] and [formula] do), is that the dynamical trajectory [formula] is no longer exactly known. Consequently, also [formula] (besides [formula]) is not univocally determined by ([\ref=62]) even if [formula] is known. This is a general result: if it is not possible to assign the initial condition on [formula], then the motion (also only the external motion) is no more univocally determined. We can only obtain a family of possible motions, but not the real motion. In this framework, the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics (second postulate) has therefore a "natural" assessment: the theory is intrinsically deterministic, but our impossibility on fixing the initial condition makes necessary a probabilistic formulation of it.

Concluding remarks

In this paper we have generalized the result obtained by Recami and Salesi in ref. [\cite=rs] and discussed its implications. We have shown that the quantum effects present in the Schrödinger equation are due to the presence of a peculiar spatial direction associated with the particle that, assuming the isotropy of space, we identify with the spin of the particle itself. This result has been obtained by studying the invariance properties of the equations of motion (especially the continuity equation). The picture emerged from this analysis is the following: the motion of a quantum particle is made of an "external" motion, described by the velocity field [formula] defined in ([\ref=26]), and an "internal" one (featured by the presence of spin), driven by [formula], where [formula] is given in ([\ref=27]) and [formula] is the spin direction of the particle. In this framework, the so called "quantum potential" is completely determined from the kinetic energy of the internal motion. This allows to give a very simple and natural explanations of some "unusual" properties attributed to the quantum potential, as discussed in section 5.

The use of the quantum potential is particularly useful for the causal (De Broglie - Bohm) interpretation of quantum mechanics; we have then reformulated this interpretation to take into account the results obtained in the previous sections, pointing out how this reformulation can be realized in Nature. In particular, we discussed the physical implications of the insurgence of an internal motion on the definition of the initial conditions, which can be specified only on the external (mean) motion. This requires necessarily a probabilistic formulation of quantum mechanics. In this view, the internal motion is responsible both of the quantum effects (described, properly, by the Hamilton-Jacobi equation ([\ref=33])) and of the quantum probabilistic interpretation of them (which is allowed by the continuity equation ([\ref=37]) and, in the present formulation, by the fact that the internal motion has no effect on it through the probability current density [formula] in ([\ref=317])). This result is, in some sense, a bridge between the causal and statistical formulation of quantum mechanics: the theory is in its own deterministic, but our impossibility to define proper initial conditions (caused by the presence of an internal motion) forces to give a probabilistic interpretation of it. The experimental confirmation of this probabilistic formulation is then interpreted as an evidence of the internal motion for quantum systems.
