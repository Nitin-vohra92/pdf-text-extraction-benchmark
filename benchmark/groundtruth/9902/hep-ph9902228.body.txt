DEVIATIONS FROM LORENTZ INVARIANCE FOR ULTRAHIGH-ENERGY FERMIONS

Recently a new fundamental theory was proposed. [\cite=a] One of its predictions is a failure of Lorentz invariance at ultrahigh energies. Here the implications of this feature will be considered in more detail.

According to (4.4), (4.5), and (4.7) of Ref. 1, the Euclidean Lagrangian density for a massless fermion has the form

[formula]

where M is a fundamental mass which is comparable to the Planck mass and hμν  =  δμν is the metric in an initial (preferred) coordinate system. The coupling to gauge fields and the extra fields of (4.12) has been neglected. If the variation in vμ is also neglected, we obtain the Lorentzian Lagrangian density

[formula]

where ημν = diag( - 1,1,1,1) is the Minkowski metric tensor.

This is the generalization of (9.5) of Ref. 1, in which the first term is neglected. In (4.15) of Ref. 1, vμα is interpreted as the gravitational vierbein eμα, which determines the gravitational metric tensor gμν through the relations

[formula]

Then the expression for L yields the equation of motion

[formula]

which can also be written

[formula]

The cosmological model of Ref. 1 implies that

[formula]

[formula]

so (5) can be put in the form

[formula]

After transforming to a locally inertial frame of reference, in which eμα  =  δμα, we have

[formula]

For a plane wave state [formula] this gives

[formula]

where [formula] and

[formula]

Now consider a particle with right- and left-handed fields coupled by a mass m. The Lagrangian density is

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. [\cite=r] In a locally inertial frame, the resulting equation of motion is

[formula]

or, at fixed energy E and momentum [formula],

[formula]

[formula]

Solution of these coupled equations gives

[formula]

or

[formula]

where the ±   signs are independent. Then the lowest-order corrections to Einstein relativity are given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

An argument given below implies that α  =  β, or γ = 0, but let us first consider the behavior of ultrahigh-energy fermions in the more general case.

In particular, consider the GZK cutoff, [\cite=gzk] [\cite=cg] which results from collision of a charged fermion with a black-body photon. The incoming photon has energy ω and momentum ( - ω cos θ, - ω sin θ,0) in units with [formula]. The incoming fermion has mass ma, energy E, and momentum (p,0,0). The outgoing fermion has mass mb, energy E + ω, and momentum (p - ω cos θ, - ω sin θ,0). If ω is small (as it is for a black-body photon), it is valid to use

[formula]

with

[formula]

[formula]

for m2 / p2  ≪  1, so that

[formula]

and the threshold is for a head-on collision at the momentum p satisfying

[formula]

Since the left-hand side increases with p, this condition will always be satisfied, so there is still a GZK cutoff. This does not appear to be a problem, however, since a recent analysis of the observations indicates that the highest-energy protons are produced by neutral particles at much less than cosmological distances. [\cite=fb]

A violation of Lorentz invariance leads to the threat of disagreement with precision experiments or high-energy observations, [\cite=cg] [\cite=ck] including prediction of new processes in the vacuum which are not observed. An example is vacuum erenkov radiation. Conservation of energy and momentum implies that

[formula]

so this process can occur if

[formula]

For m2 / p2  ≪  1, the expression (25) implies that

[formula]

If we were to have β  <  α, the particle velocity at high momentum would be greater than the velocity of light, and there would be a radiation of photons in vacuum which is in conflict with observation. [\cite=cg]

Next consider the process photon  →  e+e-, which will occur if

[formula]

It is reasonable to assume the threshold is below α- 1, so that (21) is valid and the condition becomes

[formula]

If we were to have β  >  α, or γ < 0, this condition would be satisfied for p3 > m2|γ|- 1 / 2. Since observations indicate that 20 TeV photons do not decay in vacuum, [\cite=cg] [\cite=cgw] |γ|- 1 would then have to lie above the Planck energy. This is inconsistent with the theory of Ref. 1, where λ and λ0 are regarded as small compared to unity.

On the other hand, if β  =  α, or γ = 0, (21) reduces to

[formula]

and the unphysical processes considered above do not occur. More generally, (25) implies that the fermion velocity v approaches the speed of light c = 1 as m2 / p2  →  0, rather than some different limiting velocity.

The condition β  =  α can be understood if one makes the following assumptions: (i) The vacuum energy density ρvac is not extremely large, in the sense that |ρvac|  ≪  m4P, where mP is the Planck mass. (To be more specific, this is the vacuum energy density which couples to gravity in the present theory. It therefore omits the negative energy density from condensed Higgs fields. [\cite=a]) (ii) The dominant positive contribution to ρvac comes from large-momentum positive-energy boson states, with velocity c = 1. (iii) The dominant negative contribution to ρvac comes from large-momentum negative-energy fermion states, with velocity [formula]. (This is the velocity v of (25) at large p.) (iv) At each large momentum p, there are an equal number of these positive-energy and negative-energy states, and they have the same momentum cutoff p0  ~  mP.

These general ideas may be illustrated with what is essentially a toy model: The SO(10) gauge theory of Ref. 1 has 45 gauge bosons. If these can be regarded as massless at the highest allowed momenta, each has 2 polarizations and an energy ω = p. (For a cutoff frequency ~  mP, there is a "Debye sphere" with volume ~  m3P and energy density ~  m4P. If the grand-unification scale is ~  10- 3  mP, the smaller sphere with this radius contributes only about 10- 12 of the full energy, so even X-bosons can be regarded as massless.) The total zero-point energy per momentum p is then [formula]. On the other hand, there are also the filled negative-energy states of (20). Suppose that only the 45 fermion fields of the standard model are relevant in the present context, and that each of these has a single negative-energy state at each large momentum p, with velocity [formula]. Their contribution to the vacuum energy is then [formula], and the total for both fermions and gauge bosons is [formula].

In the cosmological model of Ref. 1, the value of α in the late universe is fixed by topology, since it corresponds to SU(2) rotations of the order parameter Ψs in 3-space that are due to a cosmological instanton. (Recall that Ψs describes an SU(2) ×  U(1)×  SO(10) GUT Higgs field which condenses in the very early universe. [\cite=a]) The value of β, however, is not fixed by topology and is free to vary, since it is associated with U(1) oscillations of the order parameter in time. (A more detailed cosmological picture is given elsewhere. [\cite=a1]) If the assumptions listed above are valid, then the frequency of oscillation v00 must adjust itself so as to achieve a cancellation of the largest negative and positive contributions to the vacuum energy. This means that [formula], or β  =  α .

According to (33), we then obtain the standard relation of Einstein relativity

[formula]

except for very small terms involving the mass, so the present theory is consistent with experimental tests of this relation. At ultrahigh energies p  ~  α- 1 = 2λ2M, however, the fermion equation of motion is changed, and the propagator becomes [formula] with the present conventions. This change will affect the running coupling constants and other properties as one approaches the GUT scale.
