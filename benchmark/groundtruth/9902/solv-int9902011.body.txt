Introduction

In this paper, we discuss the orthonormal polynomials with respect to the weight [formula] on the unit circle in the complex plane [\cite=szego],

[formula]

where the integral is over the unit circle, and [formula] means the complex conjugate of φm(z), λ is a positive parameter. The polynomials [formula] have explicit representation in terms of the Toeplitz determinants [formula] [\cite=szego]. Here we are interested in analyzing the properties of the leading coefficient κn(λ). As discussed in [\cite=szego], κ2n can be expressed in terms of the Toeplitz determinants,

[formula]

And by the Szegö strong limit theorem, lim n  →    ∞Dn(λ) = eλ. So we have κ2n  →  1, as n  →    ∞  .

From the orthonormal property and the recursion formula of the φn's, we show that κn satisfies the following difference-differential equation

[formula]

where [formula], and [formula] If we make the scaling

[formula]

with T(n,s)  =  t(n,s)  +  ε(n,s), and

[formula]

then we obtain, as n  →    ∞  , that the parameters satisfy α = 1 / 3,β  =  2 / 3,c1  =    -  21 / 3,c2  =   - 1 / 21 / 3,c3  =  2, ε(n,s) = O(1 / (n + 1)1 / 3), and the function R satisfies

[formula]

If we drop the o(1) term, the equation above is another form of the Painlevé II equation which is discussed by Tracy and Widom in [\cite=tracy]. So ([\ref=E:1.2]) is called spatially discrete Painlevé II equation in this sense.

Therefore we have another proof of the asymptotic formula

[formula]

where R'(t) =  - q2(t), and q(t) satisfies the Painlevé II equation q''  =  tq  +  2q3. This asymptotic formula was first proved by Baik, Deift and Johansson [\cite=baik] using Riemann-Hilbert problems. They discussed much more asymptotic properties for κn. See [\cite=baik] for the details. The asymptotic formula ([\ref=E:1.10a]) is used for investigating the distribution of the length ln of the longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation [\cite=baik], by discussing the asymptotics of the [formula]. The distribution of ln (as n  →    ∞  ) is same as the distribution of the largest eigenvalue of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) in random matrix theory [\cite=baik] [\cite=tracy2] [\cite=tracy3]. In [\cite=tracy3], Tracy and Widom used a different method to study the distribution of the ln by directly investigating the asymptotics of Dn(λ). They also obtained the distribution of the length of the longest increasing subsequence of an odd permutatiom [\cite=tracy3].

In [\cite=hisakado] , Hisakado discussed the same polynomials as in this paper, and he also get Painlevé II equation from a discrete equation which is called discrete string equation in [\cite=hisakado]. The difference is as follows. In [\cite=hisakado], Hisakado discussed that the constant term of polynomial φn(z) / κn satisfies a discrete equation (discrete string equation). In this paper, we discuss κn, the coefficient of the leading term of φn(z), which satisfies a spatially discrete equation (difference-differential equation). And the discrete string equation in [\cite=hisakado] is convergent to the original Painlevé II ( q''  =  xq  +  2q3). In this paper, the spatially discrete equation is convergent to a third order differential equation. As discussed by Tracy and Widom in [\cite=tracy], this third order equation is equivalent to the Painlevé II equation.

It is known that the Painlevé equations have discrete analogs. See [\cite=fokas] [\cite=ramani] [\cite=clarkson] [\cite=jimbo] and references therein for the discrete or q-difference Painlevé equations. In this paper, we show that the Painlevé II equation has spatially discrte version. So far, to my knowlege, the spatially discrete versions for Painlevé equations are not known very well. In [\cite=fokas], Fokas, Its and Kitaev discussed another spatially discrete integrable equation, which is obtained from orthonormal polynomials on real line satisfying a recursion formula in the form ([\ref=E:2.40a]). It is discussed in [\cite=fokas] that the simultaneous solution of the spatially discrete equation in [\cite=fokas] and of discrete Painlevé I equation solves a special case of Painlevé IV equation.

This report is organized as follows. In the next section, we state the recursion formula for the orthonormal polynomials on the unit circle, which is proved in [\cite=szego]. In Sect. 3, we use the recursion formula and the orthonormal property of the polynomials to investigate the leading coefficient κn(s), which is found to satisfy a difference-differential equation, or spatially discrete equation. And we also get a formula for the second leading coefficient of φn(z) in terms of κn. In Sect. 4, the difference-differential equation is proved to tend to the second Painlevé equation in a third order equation form. Then we get the asymptotics of the coefficients for the leading term and for the second leading term of φn(z).

Recursion Formula for the Polynomials

Let us consider the orthonormal polynomials [formula] on the unit circle in the complex plane defined by ([\ref=E:1.1]). If we let [formula] [formula], z = eiθ, then ([\ref=E:1.1]) becomes

[formula]

Since [formula] is even in θ, the coefficients of φn are real [\cite=szego]. It is also proved in [\cite=szego] that φn satisfy the recursion formulas

[formula]

Here the "*" is defined as

[formula]

if [formula]. Notice that for φn(z), the coefficients are real as mentioned above.

Since we are interested in the leading coefficient κn, we set φn(z) = κn  pn(z), and for simplicity we denote [formula]. Then ([\ref=E:2.1]) becomes

[formula]

If we eliminate φ*n(z) in ([\ref=E:2.2]) and ([\ref=E:2.3]), we get

[formula]

By φn(z) = κn    pn(z), ([\ref=E:2.10]) becomes

[formula]

For the usage in later discussions, let us record this as a lemma, which is due to Szegö [\cite=szego].

The orthogonal polynomials pn(z) defined by ([\ref=E:2.5]) on the unit circle in the complex plane satisfy the following recursion formula

[formula]

where

[formula]

As a remark, the recursion formula for the orthogonal polynomials on the real line takes the form [\cite=szego] [\cite=tracy1]

[formula]

But we have seen that on the unit circle with the weight dμ, the coefficient of pn - 1 in the recursion formula contains z.

Spatially Discrete Equation for κn

In this section, we use the orthogonal relation ([\ref=E:2.5]) and the recursion relation ([\ref=E:2.20]) to show that κn(s) satisfies a spatially discrete equation (difference-differential equation). In the next section we show that the contineous limit of this spatially discrete equation gives a third order ordinary differential equation, which is equivalent to Painlevé II equation.

Let us write ([\ref=E:2.5]) in the form

[formula]

where hn  =  2πi  /  κ2n, and the integral [formula] is taken over the unit circle in the complex plane. We will use the notation dμ  =  f(z)dz / z for simplicity. First it is easy to show the following identities

[formula]

by using z = eiθ, and θ replaced by -  θ. Recall [formula].

Now, consider ([\ref=E:3.5]) with m = n,

[formula]

Then by integration by parts and using ([\ref=E:3.10]) and ([\ref=E:3.11]), we have

[formula]

Since [formula] on the unit circle, by the Cauchy integral formula, the right hand side of the above equation can be calculated, and the result involves all the coefficients of pn(z). That does not help too much to investigate the κn. Here, by using the recursion formula and the orthonormal property, the right side of ([\ref=E:3.15]) can be expressed in terms of hn - 1,hn,hn + 1 and their first derivatives.

We need to consider two type integrals,

[formula]

for ([\ref=E:3.15]), where k is integer. In this paper, we do not discuss the general formula. We just consider the integrals in ([\ref=E:3.15]), and the formulas are given in the following lemmas.

[formula]

Proof. Multiply [formula] on both sides of ([\ref=E:2.20]). Then integrating on both sides yields the result.

[formula]

Proof. Let [formula] By Lemma 1, we have

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

where we have used < pn + 2,pn >  =  < pn + 1,pn >  = 0. Again by Lemma 1,

[formula]

Since < pn - 1,pn >  =  < z  pn - 2,pn >  = 0, we then obtain from ([\ref=E:3.7a])

[formula]

where < z  pn - 1,pn >  =  < z2  pn - 2,pn >  = hn.

In order to evaluate the integral < z2  ∂pn  /  ∂z,pn  >   in ([\ref=E:3.15]), we need to consider the second leading coefficient of pn(z). Suppose

[formula]

Because [formula] we set

[formula]

Then by

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

Since [formula], we have proved the following lemma.

[formula]

Because we want an equation for the leading coefficient κn, we need to express the second leading coefficient bn in terms of κn. First, the bn can be expressed in terms of Bn and Cn.

For the second leading coefficient bn of pn defined by ([\ref=E:3.30]), there are the following properties

[formula]

Proof. By Lemma 1, z    pn(z) = pn + 1(z) + Bn    pn(z) - Cn  z    pn - 1(z). By ([\ref=E:3.30]), [formula]. Then we have (bn - 1 - bn)hn = Bn  hn  -  Cn  hn by considering < z  pn,pn  >   in the two ways.

To prove the second formula ([\ref=E:3.41]), consider

[formula]

Using integration by parts,

[formula]

where [formula], and < pn + 1,z  pn >  = hn + 1. And [formula]. Set [formula], which implies [formula] . Then by

[formula]

we get [formula], so [formula]. Thus

[formula]

On the other hand, the integral I can be evaluated by using the recursion formula (see ([\ref=E:2.20]))

[formula]

which gives

[formula]

By ([\ref=E:3.50]) and ([\ref=E:3.55]), we get ([\ref=E:3.41]).

We have seen by the last four lemmas that the right hand side of ([\ref=E:3.15]) can be expressed in terms of Bn and Cn. The following lemma gives the formulas of Bn,Cn in terms of κn.

The coefficients Bn,Cn in the recursion formula (see ([\ref=E:2.25]), ([\ref=E:2.26])) can be expressed as follows.

[formula]

where κn is the leading coefficient of φn defined by ([\ref=E:1.1]), and [formula].

Proof. Since hn =  < pn,pn  >  , we have

[formula]

where we have used [formula], since deg[formula], deg[formula]. Then by Lemma 1 and the notation hn = 2πi / κ2n, we have the first formula ([\ref=E:3.51]). By ([\ref=E:2.25]) and ([\ref=E:2.26]), there is Cn  =  Bn  κ2n - 1  /  κ2n. We then get ([\ref=E:3.52]) and ([\ref=E:3.53]).

By Lemma 2, 3, 4, ([\ref=E:3.15]) is changed to

[formula]

By Lemma 5, this equation further becomes

[formula]

Therefore by Lemma 6, we have proved the following theorem.

The leading coefficient κn(s) of the orthonormal polynomials φn(z) defined by ([\ref=E:1.1]) satisfies the following spatially discrete equation ( difference-differential equation)

[formula]

where [formula], and [formula]

This is a new result for κn(s), the leading coefficients of the orthonomial polynomials φn(z,s), with the weight [formula] on the unit circle. In the next section, we show that as n  →    ∞  , this equation is reduced to a third order ordinary differential equation which is equivalent to the Painlevé II equation.

Painlevé II Equation

We have shown that κ2n satisfies the equation ([\ref=E:3.f]). As mentioned in Sect. 1, κ2n satisfies the boundary condition κ2n = 1 + o(1), as n  →    ∞  . In this section, we compute the asymptotics of κ2n - 1, as n  →    ∞  . We will see that the asymptotics involves the second Painlevé function.

Equation ([\ref=E:3.f]) has two independent variables n and s. To study the asymptotics, we use "similarity" reduction, or the so called double scaling method. By comparing the first two terms in ([\ref=E:3.f]), we consider the case when n + 1 and s are in the same order as they are large, and let

[formula]

where T(n,s)  =  t(n,s)  +  ε(n,s), the leading term t(n,s) is defined by ([\ref=E:4.1]), and it will be shown that ε(n,s) is a smaller term as n  →    ∞  . We want to determine the constants α,β,c1,c2,c3, such that as n  →    ∞  , ([\ref=E:3.f]) is reduced to a differential equation.

Let us consider the approximate expressions of (κ2n)s, κ2n + 1  -  κ2n in terms of R' and maybe also higher order derivatives if we need. Here R' means the limit of (R(T + ΔT) - R(T)) / ΔT. By ([\ref=E:4.1]), for fixed s, as n increases by 1, t is increased by a order 1 / (n + 1)1 - β. For the asymptotics of κ2n + 1  -  κ2n and (κ2n + 1)s  -  (κ2n)s, the higher order terms also need to be concerned in order to have all the terms in the first three leading orders in the expansion of left side of ([\ref=E:3.f]). Therefore we have the following

[formula]

where c4 is a constant, and

[formula]

Now write ([\ref=E:3.f]) in the following form

[formula]

By substituting the asymptotic formulas above into this equation, we get

[formula]

where

[formula]

By the definition of t and asymptotics of Δt, we have 0 < β  <  1. Since κ2n  →  1, as n  →    ∞  , we have α > 0. Consider the orders of the terms on the left side of ([\ref=E:4.40]). The coefficients of (R')2,R'R'',R'R''',(R'')2 have orders 2(1 + α  -  β), 2(1 + α  -  β) + (1 - β), 2(1 + α  -  β) + 2(1 - β), 2(1 + α  -  β) + 2(1 - β) respectively. The coefficients of t(R')2,RR',(R')3 have orders 2(1 + α  -  β) + β, 2(1 + α  -  β) + β, 2(1 + α  -  β) + (1 + α  -  β) respectively. And the o(1) in ([\ref=E:4.40]) contains higher order terms which we do not concern. To determine the values of α and β, the only choice is to set the coefficients of R'R''', (R'')2, t(R')2, RR' and (R')3 be in the same order. So we have 2(1 - β)  =  β  =  1 + α  -  β. The solution is unique α = 1 / 3,β  =  2 / 3. So ([\ref=E:4.40]) becomes

[formula]

where

[formula]

Look at the equation ([\ref=E:4.50]). If A1 or A2 is not zero, then we get asymptotics of κn contradicting to the results proved in [\cite=szego]. In [\cite=szego], the asymptotics of κn contains exponential function of s. So we must have A1  =  A2 = 0. The coefficient of the 1 / (n + 1)2 in ({[\ref=E:4.50]) has the pattern of Painlevé II equation in [\cite=tracy]. So we want to choose proper constant numbers c1,c2,c3,c4, such that as n  →    ∞  , ({[\ref=E:4.50]) reduces to the Painlevé II equation. In [\cite=tracy], Tracy and Widom discussed two forms of Painlevé II equation

[formula]

[formula]

where R'(t)  =    -  q(t)2, and q(t) satisfies the original Painlevé II q''  =  tq  +  2q3. Equation ([\ref=E:4.61]) is called Jimbo-Miwa-Okamoto σ form for Painlevé II. Eliminating the R in ([\ref=E:4.60]) and ([\ref=E:4.61]) gives another form

[formula]

In ([\ref=E:4.50]), we set A1 = A2 = A3 = 0, A4 =  - 2A5, A6  =  4A5, and A7  =   - 8A5. By using ([\ref=E:4.30]) and ([\ref=E:4.31]), the solution of these nonlinear equations is found to be

[formula]

Since we consider positive n and s, c3 is positive, i.e., c3  =  2. And it is seen that ε(n,s)  =  O(1 / (n + 1)1 / 3) because the last term in ([\ref=E:4.50]) is 1 / 3 order higher than the proceding term.

Therefore we have a formal proof of the following theorem which was first proved by Baik, Deift and Johansson [\cite=baik] by using Riemann-Hilbert method.

As n  →    ∞  , κ2n has the following asymptotic formula

[formula]

where t is defined by [formula], R'(t)  =   - q2(t), and q(t) satisfies Painlevé II q'' = tq + 2q3.

As discussed in [\cite=baik], the Painlevé II function q(t) in Theorem 2 satisfies the boundary condition q(t)  ~    -  Ai(t), as t  →    ∞  , where Ai(t) is the Airy function. This boundary condition can also be obtained by the asymptotics of κn in terms of exponential function [\cite=szego] and the Painlevé II equation that q(t) satisfies. The Painlevé II function q(t) with this boundary condition is discussed by Hastings and McLeod in [\cite=mcleod].

As a remark, there is no resolution if ones want to get ([\ref=E:4.60]) or ([\ref=E:4.61]) from ([\ref=E:4.50]). So these three equations ([\ref=E:4.60]), ([\ref=E:4.61]) and ([\ref=E:4.62]) play different roles. It is interesting that in [\cite=haine] there is a similar augument for three forms of Painlevé VI equation. It is discussed in [\cite=haine] that by eliminiting the third order derivative in the equation obtained in [\cite=haine] and in the equation in [\cite=tracy1], ones get the σ form of Painlevé VI.

Finally by Lemma 5, Lemma 6 and Theorem 2, we obtain the asymptotics for the second leading coefficient of φn(z).

For the polynomial [formula] defined by ([\ref=E:1.1]), the second leading coefficient κn  bn - 1 has the asymptotic formula

[formula]

as n  →    ∞  , where t and R(t) are same as in Theorem 2.
