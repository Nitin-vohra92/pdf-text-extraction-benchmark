Quantum phenomenology and the Continuum Problem

The concept of discrete space is always regarded as the unique alternative of the continuous space. Nevertheless, it is important to stress that there is the intermediate possibility connected with the Continuum Problem (discrete space is a countable set). According to the independence of the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) we can neither prove nor disprove existence of a set of cardinality between cardinalities of countably infinite set and continuum. If Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory is consistent and complete, then the uncertain status of the intermediate set is unavoidable: no one can state that the set does not exist but at the same time we in principle can not get it anyhow. In other words, uncertainty seems to be a property of the intermediate set. On the other hand, this set standing midway between countable set and continuum may combine properties of continuity (wave) and countability (particle). Hence, Wave-Particle duality may be considered as the direct pointing to the Continuum Problem and the intermediate set.

Suppose there exists a set S such that

[formula]

where N is the set of natural numbers, R is the set of all real numbers (let S be called an interset). Then R contains a subset M equivalent to S, i.e., there exists a bijection f:S  →  M = f(S)  ⊂  R separating M from the set of real numbers. But it follows from independence of CH that the interset can not be separated from continuum: any procedure of separation is a proof of the negation of the Continuum Hypothesis. Hence, for any real number r∈R we do not know, in principle, if the sentence r∈M is true or false. Therefore, any bijection can not take a point s∈S to a definite real number (the uncertain status of the intermediate set causes uncertainty of its members with respect to real numbers).

Then the point s corresponds to entire continuum R and we can assign to the point a function ψ(r) defined on the same domain R. If a map takes s to a random real number, then the function ψ(r) has to be connected with probability P(r) of finding the point at r: P(r) = P(ψ(r))Δr. For of two real numbers a and b probability [formula] of finding the point in the union of their neighbourhoods [formula] because the point s corresponds to both intervals at the same time (the events are not mutually exclusive). Then it is convenient to choose the function ψ(r) such that

[formula]

But

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

i.e., the dependence P(ψ(r)) is nonlinear. The simplest nonlinear dependence is a square dependence:

[formula]

CH is under discussion for more than one hundred years but no one can find in the set theory literature any description of probable properties of the interset. It is due to the following reason. According to the separation axiom schema for any set X and for any property expressed by formula φ there exists a subset of the set X, which contains only members of X having φ:

[formula]

If the interset can not be separated from R, then its members have not any distinction with respect to the members of continuum (uncertainty is not a set theory property). Hence, the properties of the interset are

(1) uncertainty with respect to continuum,

(2) separate properties of countable sets and continuum,

(3) undecidable equivalents of the negation of CH.

Only these properties do not contradict the independence of CH because they do not allow separation of the interset from continuum in accordance with the separation axiom schema. Item (2) may be called N-R duality. Moreover, we claim that any description of the intermediate set must be based on combining separate properties of the countable set and continuum.

This is the reason why the set theorists do not like to discuss probable properties of the interset: in some sense, it has no its own properties. It may be stated that this is the cause of independence of CH. If the interset had any unique property, then it would be possible to prove its existence.

The sets of natural and real numbers have certain structures, which may be called natural. In consequence of dual nature of the intermediate set, its structure must be a combination of the natural structures of the sets of natural and real numbers. Let us form such a combination.

Any interval of continuum is equivalent to any other interval and to entire continuum. In other words, any arbitrarily small interval contains the same number of points as the set of all real numbers. This property is too strong for any real set. We will consider this property as a distinctive feature of continuum. And for the interset we shall substitute the following combination of the properties of the continuous and countable sets for the property of continuum: there exists a unit (minimal) set (unlike continuum) but this set is infinite (unlike the set of natural numbers). Consequently, different intervals of the interset are not equivalent (different intervals of real numbers, generally speaking, contain subsets of different intermediate cardinalities). Cardinality of the unit set is an infinite fundamental constant.

Coordinate of a point in the interset in units of the minimal set is a natural number n. The function ψ, necessarily, depends on n:

[formula]

Since n is accurate up to a constant (shift) and the function ψ is defined up to the factor ei, we have

[formula]

Hence, the function ψ is of the following form:

[formula]

where natural number ν is the (constant) time rate of change of cardinality (number of the unit sets per second).

Thus De Broglie wave represents the simplest map from the interset to continuum. This means that we can replace Wave-Particle duality by the mathematical concept.

In accordance with the dual description of the interset, cardinality of an interval of the interset depends on its size. Then a sufficiently large interval approach continuum. Thus the function ψ describes the real relationship between the levels (scales) of the intermediate set, i.e., the properties of the set of intermediate cardinality coincide with quantum phenomenology.

The intermediate set is absolutely new set of stepwise changing infinite cardinality (and consequently, changing structure). In fact, this is a spectrum of sets. The countable set and continuum are the ends of the spectrum. Existence of infinite quantum of cardinality is a unique property of the set.
