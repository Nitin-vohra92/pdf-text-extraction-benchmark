Abstract: Requiring that the path integral has the global symmetries of the classical action and obeys the natural composition property of path integrals, and also that the discretized action has the correct naive continuum limit, we find a viable discretization of the (D=3,N=2) superparticle action.

In this letter we discuss the path integral quantization of a N=2 superparticle in three dimensions.

There have been numerous attempts to quantize both the massive and the massless superparticle [\cite=EVAN1]-[\cite=MIKO]. Both the massless and massive models are invariant under a certain fermionic symmetry; the Siegel symmetry [\cite=SIEG1]. For the massive case quantization has been carried out both using BV-BRST methods [\cite=GREE] and using covariant methods [\cite=EVAN1]. In the massless case a covariant separation of the models first and second class constraints is not possible in general [\cite=BENG]. Attempts to circumvent this problem have been made using BV-BRST methods [\cite=LIND1] and using harmonic superspace methods [\cite=NISSI]. Also non-covariant quantization has been described [\cite=EVAN2]. A constructive path integral quantization has, to our knowledge, only been attempted in [\cite=MIKO], however. Our construction starts from a set of (natural) requirements on the path integral; it should have the global symmetries of the classical action and it should obey the usual composition property of a path integral. In addition, we require the discretized action to have the correct naive continuum limit. We find a discretization that complies with these demands and construct the propagator. This propagator differs from the usual field theory propagator as well as from the propagator derived in [\cite=MIKO]. Nevertheless, as we show in a forthcoming publication [\cite=GRUN], calculations of physical entities yield the same result as in field theory.

Our analysis highlights that the path integral is a formal object which has to be given content by some evaluation prescription. This is particularly the case for fermionic variables. We also want to draw attention to the fact that the relation between the first quantized theory and the field theory is not always as simple as in the ordinary scalar field case. This is worth having in mind when trying to find a string field theory.

The point of departure is the N = 2,D = 3 superparticle phase space action:

[formula]

Here θα is a complex anticommuting 3D spinor, (α = 1,2), and the Dirac matrices satisfy

[formula]

with metric signature ( - , + , + ). The action ([\ref=action]) is invariant under the (global) N = 2 supersymmetry,

[formula]

reparametrizations,

[formula]

and Siegel symmetry

[formula]

To find the propagator we should evaluate

[formula]

As usual, we fix the reparametrizations by choosing

[formula]

The formal expression ([\ref=K]) is then replaced by the slightly less formal

[formula]

where

[formula]

is a function of final and initial superspace positions and

[formula]

The main body of this paper is concerned with giving a meaning to ([\ref=G]), (which we will henceforth call the propagator).

One way of defining a path integral is to discretize, i.e., to put the theory on a (time-) lattice. There are infinitely many ways to do this. For bosonic variables the usual choice is to let, (see, e.g., [\cite=SCHU]),

[formula]

If we try this prescription for our fermionic θ's, we find an ambiguity; the result depends on whether the number N of time steps is even or odd (see also [\cite=MIKO]). In [\cite=MIKO] the rule ([\ref=xd]) with odd N was choosen for fermions. We feel that this is unacceptable. A basic intuitive property of a path integral is that one should be able to calculate the amplitude of going from A to C by first calculating the amplitude from A to B, then that from B to C and finally summing over intermediate postitions B [\cite=FEYN]. The path integral as defined in [\cite=MIKO] does not fulfil this. This property is also an important ingredient in perturbative calculations. It leads to the structure "(propagator)  ×  (vertex)  ×  (propagator)  ×  ...", a structure familiar from field theory.

Guided by the above considerations we require that G in ([\ref=G]) satisfies

[formula]

(where the argument has been abbreviated, e.g., x3,θ3,3  →  3 et.c.). The condition ([\ref=cmp]) both implies a restriction on the possible discretizations and helps us determine the path integral measure. We suggest the following form for the infinitesimal propagator:

[formula]

where

[formula]

(The unusual factor [formula] is dictated by the composition rule ([\ref=cmp]) and will be further commented on below.) The discretized path integral becomes,

[formula]

but since ([\ref=infpro]) satisfies the composition property ([\ref=cmp]) we merely have to replace ε  →  T in ([\ref=infpro]) to evaluate ([\ref=discpi]) and thus obtain the finite form.

The discretization ([\ref=discs]) has several virtues: It has the correct naive continuum limit, it is translationally invariant and it is space-time supersymmetric, (c.f. ([\ref=susy])). The asymmetry between θ and [formula] should be noted. We remind the reader that a similar asymmetry exists in the path integral approach to fermions using coherent states [\cite=OHNU]. A further property of ([\ref=discpi]) is that it can be written as, (dropping the m-dependence)

[formula]

where

[formula]

This means that the propagator is (anti-)chiral with respect to the (final) initial point in superspace. i in ([\ref=Ddelta]) could just as well be replaced by f. Using the p- 2 under the integral sign, we thus have the antichiral projection operator [formula] acting. In fact, a projection operator is precisely what is needed to obtain the composition property ([\ref=cmp]). Clearly an interchange   ↔  θ leads to another viable discretization. This corresponds to replacing the antichiral projection operator by the chiral one. As a third and final independent projection operator we may use the linear operator [formula]. The corresponding discretized action contains extra θ-terms that vanish in the naive continuum limit.

Compared to the propagator derived in [\cite=SIEG1],[\cite=MIKO], we note the following discrepancies: First, all alternatives described above differ in the derivative structure from the propagator in [\cite=SIEG1],[\cite=MIKO]. Further, our propagator has an additional factor (p2 + m2)- 1, which is surprising also compared to the superfield propagators. However, the physical meaning of the propagator is unclear at this stage. To test the validity of our expression we need to calculate some physical process. The calculations will be presented elsewhere [\cite=GRUN], here we just stress some general features. We consider couplings of the superparticle to background gauge fields.The Siegel invariant coupling is:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and, for completeness, we have included a mass. The gauge multiplet is

[formula]

where V is a superfield prepotential. We derived ([\ref=scoup]) from the formalism developed in [\cite=GAUN]. It should be compared to the 10D coupling presented in [\cite=ROCE]. Note that, unlike in the superfield theory, the coupling involves the dimensionful gauge potentials rather than the dimensionless prepotential. This discrepancy between the superparticle and superfield coupling to a gauge field matches the discrepancy in the propagators. The factor p- 2 in the propagator ([\ref=Ddelta]) ensures that it has the right dimension for the perturbation expansion to be dimensionally consistent. This follows from the composition rule ([\ref=cmp]) and that the action is dimensionless. In fact, as will be shown in [\cite=GRUN], a suitable discretization of ([\ref=scoup]), (with m = 0), allows us to recover the usual superfield theory results for a physical process.

These last considerations have all been for the massless case. Including a mass will correspond to N = 2 supersymmetry with a central charge. The expression ([\ref=Ddelta]) changes in that the covariant derivatives include the central charge and in that p2  →  p2 + m2.

As mentioned in the introduction, the massive Siegel invariant superparticle has been quantized (in various dimensions) using BRST-methods [\cite=GREE], as well as canonical ones [\cite=EVAN1], (without calculating the propagator however). No difficulties of principle were encountered. For the massless case, the canonical procedure is faced with the difficulty that a covariant separation of first and second class constraints is impossible [\cite=BENG]. This has led to quantization using Batalin-Vilkovisky type Lagrangian BRST methods [\cite=LIND1]. These constructions involve an infinite tower of ghosts. Our construction would seem to circumvent both these difficulties. We have ignored the Siegel invariance, although the (anti)chirality with respect to the endpoints may be viewed as a remnant of this symmetry. The issue of first and second class constraints never arises, the construction involves no ghosts, and the limit m  →  0 seems unproblematic. Our treatment of the path integral may seem to be particular to D = 3,N = 2, but it is clear that this construction of the propagator works just as well for the D = 4,N = 1 massless superparticle. What about other cases?

The assumptions in this letter are, (explicitly), the composition property ([\ref=cmp]) and, (implicitly), that the exponent in the infinitesimal propagator should look "reasonable" as a discretization of the action. In a conventional treatment of the path integral with gauge fixing and ghosts, a modified version of ([\ref=cmp]) involving also ghost coordinates should be satisfied, since this is essentially the completeness property of intermediate states. Truncating to (xμ,θ,) is thus an assumption that the ghost coordinates decouple, which is reasonable. The second assumption is more questionable. Gauge fixing would certainly modify the action and with the gauge condition [formula] [\cite=SIEG2], the θ-dependent part of the propagator would be δN(θf  -  θi), (which certainly satisfies the composition property). The role of the ghosts is to remove unphysical states from this, i.e., to project onto an irreducible representation of supersymmetry. This is precisely what the projection operator in our construction accomplishes. (C.f. the situation in string theory with ghosts versus the Brink-Olive projection operator [\cite=GSW]). It thus seems that the existence of a projection operator that projects onto an irreducible representation of supersymmetry is the basic requirement in our construction.
