The prospect of discovering a new long range force coupling to ordinary matter is exciting from both the theoretical and experimental points of view [\cite=longrange]. Since long range forces require the existence of a massless particle, a logical place to look in the electroweak theory is at the effect due to neutrinos. The exchange of a single neutrino (or in general a single fermion) cannot give rise to a force since the interaction changes the angular momentum of the sources involved. However, the exchange of two neutrinos can leave the quantum numbers of the sources unchanged, and hence can lead to a long range force.

One might guess on the basis of dimensional analysis that the potential for this interaction could take the form Vν(r)  ~  G2Fm2  /  r3, where m is the mass of the source particle. Feynman considered this form when contemplating neutrinos as the mediators of a gravity-like interaction [\cite=Feynman]. If this were the interaction, the effects of such a force might be observable in laboratory tests [\cite=lab]. At r  ~  cm, the resulting force on normal matter would be roughly 10- 6 times smaller than that due to gravity if m is the electron mass, and comparable to that of gravity if m is a nucleon mass. The current limit on deviations from a 1 / r potential at r  ~  cm are of order 10- 4 [\cite=lab]. If the two neutrino force were measurable, it would provide experimental information on neutrino masses which is complementary to that obtained from standard particle physics experiments - long range force experiments are sensitive to extremely small masses.

Unfortunately, the form given above for Vν(r) is incorrect. The correct behaviour, which we will derive below, is 1 / r5. This yields a much smaller effect. The exact form of the interaction is therefore somewhat academic, but seems to us worth computing. The two neutrino force was investigated previously by G. Feinberg and J. Sucher [\cite=FS] and by A. De Rujula, H. Georgi and S. Glashow (unpublished). In fact, almost all of the results which appear in this paper have been obtained earlier by Feinberg and Sucher. However, our method of computation is different and we feel that it is sufficiently simple to warrant exposition. We became aware of the earlier work only after completing our own calculations. The previous authors come to conclusions similar to ours, but our detailed results disagree slightly with those of Feinberg and Sucher. Our potential Vν(r) is smaller than theirs by a factor of two, and the coefficient of our σ1  ·  σ2 term is also different. We do not at this time understand the origin of this disagreement.

Consider the diagrams shown in figure 1. Since we are interested in a long distance effect, and correspondingly low momentum exchange, it is a good approximation to combine the effects of W and Z exchange into four-fermi operators involving neutrinos and weakly charged source particles. The resulting operator can be Fierz transformed into the following form:

[formula]

where a and b depend on the fermion u.

If u is an electron, both W and Z exchange contribute, yielding a  =  2 sin 2θw  +  1 / 2 and b  =  1 / 2. For a nucleon, only Z exchange contributes, yielding a  =   - 1 / 2,b  =   - gA / 2 for the neutron and

a =   -  2 sin 2θw  +  1 / 2,b  =  gA / 2 for the proton. gA is the isotriplet axial vector form factor, with a value

of order 1.25 . W exchange alone produces a = b = 1 for electrons.

It remains to compute the diagram which results from two insertions of the operator O4. The resulting S matrix element can be directly related to the interaction potential in the non-relativistic limit. We will use momentum space Feynman rules. However, working directly in coordinate space allows one to quickly deduce the 1 / r5 form of the potential. In coordinate space massless fermion propagators behave like 1 / x3, and one integrates over all time to obtain the potential. Thus we have

[formula]

The momentum space amplitude for figure 1 is

[formula]

where q  =  p2  -  p1  =  p4  -  p3 is the momentum transfer. The polarization tensor Πμν(q) results from the fermion loop. The result is 1 / 2 times the vacuum polarization tensor which results from the non-chiral loop, which can be found in standard textbooks [\cite=text] on QED. By current conservation Πμν(q)  =  A(q2)(qμqν  -  gμνq2), where A(q2) is a dimensionless function of q2. To obtain Vν(r) it is necessary to take the Fourier transform

[formula]

The piece of the vacuum polarization which leads to a long range interaction must depend on a logarithm of q2. This is because the Fourier transform of a function which is a polynomial in qμ can always be written as derivatives of a delta function ( ∂μδ(r) ), which yield only contact interactions. The Fourier transform of a polynomial ×   log function of q can be shown to lead to 1 / rk type terms.

The relevant piece of Πμν(q) is readily extracted. This yields

[formula]

Substituting this into the expression for T yields several terms. Consider the terms which result from the contraction of qμ with γμ(a  -  bγ5). The qμγμ term is zero by the equations of motion, while the qμγμγ5 term yields (in the non-relativistic approximation) [formula], where φ is a two component Pauli spinor. The gμν terms yield the monopole-monopole term along with more complicated spin dependent terms.

The Fourier transform we need to extract the potentials from T is given by

[formula]

Using the above equation, we have the following result for Vν(r).

[formula]

where the ellipsis denote more complicated terms which are proportional to velocity and are suppressed in the non-relativistic limit, or which are of order 1 / r6 or higher. Note that the monopole-monople interaction is repulsive between two electrons. The sign of the interaction is changed if one of the particles is replaced by its antiparticle.

Let us briefly consider the phenomenological relevance of the above interaction. The two neutrino force discussed here, which couples to both nucleons and electrons, is unscreened in normal matter. However, as mentioned previously, a 1 / r5 potential is extremely weak. The adjective 'long range' is perhaps misleading as even large volumes are not capable of enhancing the effect of the force. For two nucleons Vν(r) becomes comparable to the gravitational potential energy only at separations r  ~  10- 6cm. Detection of the two neutrino force would therefore require laboratory tests of gravity on distance scales far smaller and at sensitivities far greater than thus far realized. It seems highly unlikely that this effect will be observed in the forseeable future.

It is straightforward to see that the exchange of two massless fermions can at best lead to a 1 / r5 potential for fermionic matter. Consider a general four-fermi interaction given by

[formula]

Here the ψ's are the massless fermions mediating the force, Γ1,Γ2 are generic Lorentz tensors of total dimension d (they may contain derivatives), and M is some heavy mass scale. By dimensional analysis the amplitude T resulting from two insertions of Od must have the form

[formula]

where the q's are contracted with the 1 tensors, which are now dimensionless, and A(q2) is at most logarithmically dependent on q2. Taking the Fourier transform of the above amplitude results in a potential which falls as 1 / r5 + 2d.

In the most general case of an arbitrary four-fermion vertex and a [formula] fermion it is possible to generate an interaction potential of the form V(r)  ~  m2  ~  e- 2mr / M4r3, where M is the large mass scale suppressing the four-fermion interaction and m is the neutrino mass. Note that m2e- 2mr has replaced 1 / r2 in the massive case. However, it is easy to see that even for a fermion mass which is fine tuned to some inverse distance scale r*, the strength of the massive interaction cannot be significantly enhanced over the massless one.
