Abstract

We present a set of formulae to extract the longitudinal deep inelastic structure function FL from the transverse structure function F2 and its derivative dF2 / dlnQ2 at small x. Our expressions are valid for any value of δ, being x-  δ the behavior of the parton densities at low x. Using F2 HERA data we obtain FL in the range 10- 4  ≤  x  ≤  10- 2 at Q2 = 20 GeV2. Some other applications of the formulae are pointed out.

For experimental studies of hadron-hadron processes on the new, powerful LHC collider, it is necessary to know in detail the values of the parton (quark and gluon) distributions (PD) of nucleons, especially at small values of x. The basic information on the quark structure of nucleons is extracted from the process of deep inelastic lepton-hadron scattering (DIS). Its differential cross-section has the form:

[formula]

where F2(x,Q2) and FL(x,Q2) are the transverse and longitudinal structure functions (SF), respectively.

The longitudinal SF FL(x,Q2) is a very sensitive QCD characteristic because it is equal to zero in the parton model with spin- 1 / 2 partons (it is very large with spin- 0 partons). In addition, at small values of x, FL data are not yet available, as they require a rather cumbersome procedure (see [\cite=1.5], for example).

In the present article we study the behaviour of FL(x,Q2) at small values of x, using the HERA data [\cite=F2H1], [\cite=F2ZEUS] and the method [\cite=2] of replacement of the Mellin convolution by ordinary products. By analogy with the case of the gluon distribution function (see [\cite=KOPA] and its references) it is possible to obtain the relation between FL(x,Q2), F2(x,Q2) and dF(x,Q2) / dlnQ2 at small x. Thus, the small x behaviour of the SF FL(x,Q2) can be extracted directly from the measured values of F2(x,Q2) and its derivative without a cumbersome procedure (see [\cite=1.5]). These extracted values of FL may be well considered as new small x "experimental data" of FL. When experimental data for FL at small x become available with a good accuracy, a violation of the relation will be an indication of the importance of other effects as higher twist contribution and/or of non-perturbative QCD dynamics at small x.

We follow the notation of our previous work in ref. [\cite=KOPA]. The singlet quark s(x,Q20) and gluon g(x,Q20) parton distribution functions (PDF) at some Q20 are parameterized by (see, for example, [\cite=4]):

[formula]

The value of δ is a matter of controversy. The "conventional" choice is δ = 0, which leads to a non-singular behaviour of the PD (as for example the D'0 fit in [\cite=4]) when x  →  0. Another value, [formula], was obtained in the studies performed in ref. [\cite=6] as the sum of the leading powers of ln (1 / x) in all orders of perturbation theory (PT) (D'- fit in [\cite=4]). Experimentally, recent NMC data [\cite=7] favor small values of δ. This result is also in agreement with present data for [formula] and [formula] total cross-sections (see [\cite=8]) and corresponds to the model of Landshoff and Nachtmann pomeron [\cite=9] with the exchange of a pair of non-perturbative gluons, yielding δ = 0.086. However, the new HERA data [\cite=F2H1] [\cite=F2ZEUS] prefer δ  ≥  0.2.

From the theoretical side, the type of evolution of the PD in Eq. ([\ref=1]) depends on the value and form of δ  ~  (δq  =  δg). For example, a Q2-independent δ obeys the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) equation when x-  δ  ≫  1 (see, for example, [\cite=Mar] - [\cite=EKL]). However, if δ(Q20) = 0 in some point Q20  ≥  1GeV2 (see [\cite=7], [\cite=BF], [\cite=KOTILOWX]) , the behaviour p(x,Q2)  ~  Const (p = (s,g)) is not compatible with DGLAP equation and a more singular behaviour is generated.

If we restrict the analysis to a Regge-like form of structure functions, one obtains (see [\cite=KOTILOWX])

[formula]

with next-to-leading order (NLO) δq(Q2)  ≠  δg(Q2) intercept trajectories.

Without any restriction the double-logarithmical behaviour, i.e.

[formula]

is generated.

At NLO and for f = 4 active quarks one has:

[formula]

where t ~  =  ~ ln(α(Q20) / α(Q2)) and l ~  =  ~ α(Q20)  -  α(Q2) .

As our goal is the extraction of FL without theoretical restrictions, we will consider both, the Regge-like behaviour p(x,Q2)  ~  x-  δ (if x-  δ  ≫  1) and the non-Regge dependence of Eq. ([\ref=2]) (if δ(Q20) = 0).

1. Assuming the Regge-like behaviour for the gluon distribution and F2(x,Q2) at x-  δ  ≫  1:

[formula]

we obtain the following equation for the Q2 derivative of the SF F2:

[formula]

where rηsp(α) and rηLp(α) are the combinations of the anomalous dimensions (AD) of Wilson operators γηsp  =  αγ(0),ηsp  +  α2γ(1),ηsp  +  O(α3) and Wilson coefficients [formula] and αBp,η2  +  O(α2) of the η "moment" (i.e., the corresponding variables extended from integer values of argument to non-integer ones):

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] is the sum of squares of quark charges.

With accuracy of O(x2 - δ), we have for Eq.([\ref=2.1])

[formula]

with ξsg  =  r1 + δsg / rδsg and ξLg  =  r1 + δLg / rδLg.

From Eq.([\ref=5]) and ([\ref=5.1]) one can obtain FL as a function of F2 and the derivative.

[formula]

where the result is restricted to O(x2 - δ,αx1 - δ).

To arrive to the above equation we have performed the substitution

[formula]

and neglected the term ~  s̃'(xξsg,Q2).

This replacement is very useful. The NLO AD γ(1),nsp are singular in both points, n = 1 and n = 0, and their presence into the arguments of p̃(x,Q2) makes the numerical agreement between this approximate formula and the exact calculation worse (we have checked this point using some MRS sets of parton distributions).

Using NLO approximation of r1 + δsp and r1 + δLp we easily obtain the final results for FL(x,Q2):

[formula]

where

[formula]

In principle any equation from above formulae ([\ref=9.1]), ([\ref=9.2]) may be used, because there is a strong cancelation between the shifts in the arguments of the function F2 and its derivative, and the shifts in the coefficients in front of them. The difference lies in the degree of accuracy one can reach with them, which depends on the x and Q2 region of interest.

For concrete values of δ  =  0.5 and δ  =  0.3 we obtain (for f=4 and [formula] scheme):

[formula]

2. Assuming the non-Regge-like behaviour for the gluon distribution and F2(x,Q2):

[formula]

we obtain the following equation for the Q2 derivative of the SF F2:

[formula]

where 1sp(α) and 1Lp(α) can be obtained from corresponding functions r1 + δsp(α) and r1 + δsp(α), respectively, replacing the singular term 1 / δ at δ  →  0 by 1 / :

[formula]

The singular term appears only in the NLO part of the AD γ(1),1 + δsp and the longitudinal Wilson coefficients Rp,1 + δL in Eq. ([\ref=2.2]). The replacement ([\ref=14]) corresponds to the following transformation:

[formula]

where (1),1sp (R̂p,1L) and [formula] ([formula]) are the coefficients corresponding to singular and regular parts of γ(1),1 + δsp (Rp,1 + δL), respectively.

We restrict here our calculations to O(x) because at O(x2) one obtains an additional factor in front of the function F2 and its derivative, which complicates very much the final formulae.

Repeating the analysis of the previous section step by step using the replacement ([\ref=15]), we get (for f=4):

[formula]

We have combined equations ([\ref=9.2]) and ([\ref=11.1]) in a more general formula valid for any value of δ:

[formula]

where γ̃(1),1 + δsg and g,1 + δL coincide with [formula] and [formula], respectively, with the replacement:

[formula]

In the cases x-  δ  ≫  Const and δ  →  0, the r.h.s. of ([\ref=14.1]) leads to 1 / δ and 1 / , respectively.

3. In Fig. 1 it is shown the accuracy of Eqs. ([\ref=10.1])- ([\ref=10.4]) and ([\ref=11.1]) in the reconstruction of FL at various δ values from MRS sets at Q2=20 GeV2. We have chosen for this test MRS(D0) (δ=0), MRS(D-) (δ=0.5) and MRS(G) (δ=0.3) as three representative densities (see ref. [\cite=4] and references therein). It can be observed in Fig. 1a that using the formulae ([\ref=10.1]) and ([\ref=10.2]) one gets very good agreement with the input parameterization MRS(D-) (less than 1 %) at low x.

Fig. 1b shows the degree of accuracy of the reconstruction formulae ([\ref=10.3]) and ([\ref=10.4]) with δ = 0.3. Here one should expect the set MRS (G) to give also a very good (~  1% level) agreement, however this is not the case because set (G) distinguishes the exponents of the sea-quark part δs  ~  0 from the gluon density (δg = 0.3). Thus, Eq. (12) might be slightly modified to treat this case. Note that the agreement is improved when x values decrease because the relative importance of the quark contribution becomes smaller.

Fig. 1c deal with the case δ = 0. As in Fig. 1a, one can observe a very good accuracy in the reconstruction when Q20 is closed to that of the test parameterization (4 GeV2 for MRS set). Notice also the lost of accuracy at high x due to the importance of the O(x) terms neglected in Eq.([\ref=11.1]).

With the help of Eqs. ([\ref=10.1]), ([\ref=10.3]) and ([\ref=11.1]) we have extracted the longitudinal SF FL(x,Q2) from HERA data, using the slopes dF2/dlnQ2 determined in ref. [\cite=H1PREP95] and ref. [\cite=ZEUSGLU95]. When H1 data are used, the value of F2 in Eq. ([\ref=10.1]) was directly taken from the parameterization given by H1 in ref. [\cite=F2H1]. With ZEUS data we substitute directly the F2 values presented in table 1 of ref. [\cite=ZEUSGLU95]. We have checked that the use of the H1 parameterization for F2 when dealing with ZEUS data, does not change significantly the FL(x,Q2) result. Another input ingredient in the extraction formulae is αs(Q2). We have used the NLO QCD approximation with [formula] MeV, even though the results are no very sensitive to this value. For example, a variation in Λ of around ±  50 MeV changes the results less that a 1 %.

Figure 2 shows the extracted values of the longitudinal SF and the prediction in QCD using MRS sets (G), (D-) and (D0) and the O(α2s) coefficients calculated in ref. [\cite=FLNLO]. For comparison we have included in the same figure the results from different formulae. In Fig. 2a the points extracted with δ = 0 and δ = 0.5 are spread over a band which could be considered as an indication of the theoretical uncertainty of the method, if δ were completely unknown. However, in a realistic situation, the uncertainty should be smaller if one could restrict in advance the value of δ, as it is discussed below.

On the other hand, the deviation between the data points using δ = 0 and the prediction of FL from MRS(D0) parton distributions, is a signal that the formula is inadequate for the extraction of FL. In this case the origin of the discrepancy is not clear. It could be due to the importance of other contributions, not considered in the formula, or perhaps simply that δ is large.

In general it can be observed that the agreement, within the errors, with the calculation from sets MRS(G) and MRS(D-) is excellent. There is also a relative good agreement with a preliminary experimental H1 point for FL ref. [\cite=H1FL], if one takes into account the systematic error, not shown in Fig. 2a.

4. In summary, we have presented Eqs. ([\ref=9.1])-([\ref=10.3]) for the extraction of the longitudinal SF FL at small x from the SF F2 and its Q2 derivative. These equations provide the possibility of the non-direct determination of FL. This is important since the direct extraction of FL from experimental data is a cumbersome procedure (see [\cite=1.5]). Moreover, the fulfillment of Eqs. ([\ref=9.1])-([\ref=10.4]) in DIS experimental data is a cross-check of perturbative QCD at small values of x.

We have found, as in the case of the gluon extraction formulas [\cite=KOPA], that for singular type of partonic densities the results do not depend practically on the concrete value of the slope δ, due to a cancelation of that dependence between certain coefficients. However, when δ  →  0, the coefficients in front of dF2(x,Q2) / dlnQ2 and F2(x,Q2) have singularities leading to terms [formula]. In this case there is a strong correlation between the results and the concrete form of small x asymptotics of F2(x,Q2).

Consequently, before to apply these formulae, some study of the experimental data is necessary in order to verify the type of F2(x,Q2) behavior at x  →  0 (i.e. the value of δ). Note that this study should be done at a fixed value of Q2 and it does not require the knowledge of the quark and gluon content. For example, in Ref. [\cite=EKL] it was suggested the determination of the slope from the observable dF2(x,Q2) / dlnx, which was measured in [\cite=H1PREP95].
