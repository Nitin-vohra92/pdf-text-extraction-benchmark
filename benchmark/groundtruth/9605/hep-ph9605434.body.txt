Abstract

The transverse polarization distribution of quarks h1(x) is computed in a confinement model, the chiral chromodielectric model. The flavor structure of h1, its Q2 evolution and Soffer's inequality are studied. The Drell-Yan double transverse asymmetry ATT is evaluated and found to be one order of magnitude smaller than the double longitudinal asymmetry.

The interest in the transverse polarization distribution of quarks and antiquarks, customarily called h1(x), has been recently strengthened by the perspective of its possible measurement in future collider experiments. Originally introduced by Ralston and Soper [\cite=RS], who called it hT(x), h1(x) has been studied in detail, from a formal point of view, in more recent papers [\cite=JJ] [\cite=AM]. The possible ways of measuring h1(x) in various hard processes have been also thouroughly investigated [\cite=AM] [\cite=CPR] [\cite=Ji] [\cite=JJ2]. Despite this intensive work, not much is actually known about the shape and the magnitude of h1(x). This is of course not surprising since h1, like all quark distributions, cannot be derived from the fundamental theory of strong interactions, QCD. At present we possess only: i) an admittedly crude evaluation of h1(x) in the simplest version of the MIT bag model [\cite=JJ], and ii) an estimate of its first moment - the so-called tensor charge - obtained by QCD sum rule methods [\cite=HJ]. It is clear that a more sophisticated model calculation of h1(x) is called for. This would also provide useful indications about the concrete possibility of a measurement of h1(x) in the experiments which are now being planned.

The difficulty of an experimental determination of h1(x), which is a leading twist quantity, resides mainly in the fact that, being a chirally-odd distribution, it is not measurable in polarized deep inelastic scattering. The best method to extract h1(x) seems to be [\cite=CPR] [\cite=Ji] the Drell-Yan dilepton production with two transversely polarized proton beams, an experiment which will be performed in the near future at RHIC [\cite=RHIC]. The Drell-Yan double transverse asymmetry ATT contains information on the flavor structure of h1. Therefore it would be important to predict the magnitude of ATT in order to test the feasibility of the experiment. The available model calculations of ATT [\cite=Ji] [\cite=BS] are all based on the assumption that hq1 is approximately equal to the helicity distribution Δq. Although this is probably true at very low momentum scales, such as those at which confinement model computations are implicitly performed ([formula] GeV2, see below), it is certainly not true at experimental Q2 scales (say Q2  ≥  10 GeV2). The reason is that Δq and hq1 evolve differently in Q2. Whereas the first moment of Δq is constant, the first moment of hq1 decreases with increasing Q2, and the evolution in the x-shape is even more dramatically different. Again, a more firmly based evaluation of ATT is needed to check whether this quantity is comparable in magnitude with the double longitudinal asymmetry ALL, as it is claimed in [\cite=Ji] [\cite=BS].

Another issue which is certainly worth exploring in the framework of confinement models is the inequality among leading twist polarized and unpolarized distribution functions recently derived by Soffer [\cite=Soffer] (see also [\cite=GJJ]) and the possibility of its saturation.

In the following we shall provide a theoretical determination of h1(x) in a confinement model, the chiral chromodielectric model [\cite=Pirner], which has been already succesfully used to compute other leading twist structure functions and various nucleon properties. In particular, the flavor structure of h1 will be described in detail and the effects of the peculiar QCD evolution of h1 investigated. A prediction for ATT will also be presented. As we shall see, due to the different evolution of hq1 and Δq, ATT turns out to be much smaller than ALL.

The quark transverse polarization distribution reads [\cite=JJ]

[formula]

A similar expression holds for the antiquark distribution, with the exchange of ψ and [formula]. Note that in eq. ([\ref=defh1]) only the 'good' light-cone components of the fields, [formula], appear, signaling that h1 is a leading twist quantity. The h1 distribution measures the difference in the number of quarks with transverse polarization parallel ([formula]) and anti-parallel ([formula]) to the proton transverse polarization. This can be made transparent by introducing the Pauli-Lubanski projectors [formula] and inserting a complete set of states {|X〉} in eq. ([\ref=defh1]). We then get

[formula]

In a (projected) mean-field approximation, the matrix elements in eq. ([\ref=2]) can be rewritten in terms of single-particle (quark or antiquark) matrix elements. For a flavor f one thus gets

[formula]

where φ is the single-quark wave function, m is the projection of the quark spin along the direction of the nucleon's spin, P(f,α,m) is the probability of extracting a quark of flavor f and spin m leaving a state generically labelled by the quantum number α. The overlap function Aα(pα) contains the details of the intermediate states and of the projection used to obtain a nucleon with definite linear momentum from a three-quark bag (see for instance [\cite=Thomas] [\cite=noi]). The intermediate states which contribute to eqs. ([\ref=2],[\ref=ingredients]) are 2q and 3q1 states for the quark distribution, and 4q states for the antiquark distribution.

At this point, we can already discuss qualitatively the Soffer inequality [\cite=Soffer], which reads

[formula]

where Δqf is the helicity distribution function and qf the unpolarized density. This relation has been proved in the parton model [\cite=Soffer] [\cite=GJJ] (for a QCD-improved parton model discussion of Soffer's inequality see [\cite=B]), and is satisfied flavor by flavor by both the quark and the antiquark distributions. An interesting issue is whether Soffer's inequality is saturated in some quark model (which means that |hq1| takes its maximal value). To clarify this problem let us write the various leading twist distributions in an explicit form

[formula]

where

[formula]

In eq. ([\ref=correnti]) [formula] is the projection of the momentum in the plane perpendicular to the proton's trajectory (chosen to be the z axis), and the currents have been written in terms of the single quark wave-function in momentum space

[formula]

Notice that the three quantities Fα,Gα,Hα satisfy the equality: Fα(x)  +  Gα(x)  =  2  Hα(x). This has led to the erroneous conclusion [\cite=Soffer] that the inequality ([\ref=eq4]) is saturated for a relativistic quark model, such as the MIT bag model. It is clear from eqs. (5-7) that the spin-flavor structure of the proton, which results in the appearance of the probabilities P(f,α,m), spoils this argument and prevents in general the saturation of the inequality.

Soffer's inequality is saturated only in very specific (and somehow unrealistic) cases. For instance, it is saturated when P(f,α, - 1 / 2) = 0, which happens if the proton is modeled as a bound state of a scalar diquark and a u quark. Of course, this is too a rough picture of the proton. However, it is interesting to note that in SU(6) the Λ is a bound state of a scalar-isoscalar ud diquark and an s quark: the h1 distribution of the latter then attains the maximal value compatible with ([\ref=eq4]).

Another instance of saturation is when Fα = Gα = Hα and P(f,α, - 1 / 2) = 2  P(f,α,1 / 2). It is easy to verify that this happens for the d quark distribution in a nonrelativistic model of the proton with an SU(6) wavefunction.

Apart from the two particular cases illustrated above, Soffer's inequality should not be expected to be saturated, and indeed it is satisfied but not saturated in the model we present here.

The model of the nucleon that we use to compute all ingredients appearing in eq. ([\ref=ingredients]) and then to evaluate the quark distribution functions is the chiral chromodielectric model (CCDM) [\cite=Pirner]. The Lagrangian of the CCDM reads

[formula]

where U(σ,) is the usual mexican-hat potential, see e.g. [\cite=NF93]. L describes a system of interacting quarks, pions, sigmas and a scalar-isoscalar chiral singlet field χ. The parameters of the model are: the chiral meson masses mπ = 0.14 GeV, mσ = 1.2 GeV, the pion decay constant fπ = 93 MeV, the quark-meson coupling constant g, and the mass M of the χ field. The parameters g and M, which are the only free parameters of the model, have been univoquely fixed by reproducing the average nucleon-delta mass and the isoscalar radius of the proton.

The CCDM Lagrangian ([\ref=eq:in1]) contains a single-minimum potential for the chromodielectric field χ: [formula]. A double-minimum version of the CCDM is also widely studied and used (see for instance [\cite=noipl]). We have checked that the structure functions computed in the two versions of the CCDM do not differ sensibly.

The technique used to compute the physical nucleon state appearing in eq. ([\ref=defh1]) is based on a double projection of the mean-field solution on linear and angular momentum eigenstates. This technique was already used to compute the static properties of the nucleon [\cite=NF93], the unpolarized and the longitudinally polarized distribution functions [\cite=noipl] and the nucleon electromagnetic form factors [\cite=ff]. We refer the reader to these references for more details.

The intermediate states labelled by the quantum numbers α in eq. ([\ref=ingredients]) are also computed within the CCDM. Notice that they are admitted in the model, since this has no color. The lightest states contributing to the quark distributions are the diquark states (scalar ud and vectorial uu,ud). These correspond to diagrams in which a quark is extracted and probed by the photon. It turns out that more massive states (3q1 states arising from an antiquark insertion) give smaller contributions to the structure functions and are important only at small x. The antiquark distribution receives contributions from the 4q states, which correspond to diagrams with a quark insertion. We explicitly found that all these terms saturate with a ~  4% accuracy the normalization of the u and d valence distributions. This fulfillment of the valence number sum rule is of course a crucial check of the reliability of our calculation. The momentum sum rule is satisfied as well: in our model [\cite=noi] [\cite=noipl], at Q20 the valence carries about 75% of the energy-momentum, the remaining part being carried by the mesons and the dielectric field (which, in the spirit of the CCDM, embodies nonperturbative glue).

The transverse polarization distributions of quarks and antiquarks obtained from eq. ([\ref=ingredients]) using the chiral chromodielectric model are shown in Figs. 1-2. We should recall that the distributions computed in a quark model have no dependence on the momentum transfer. They represent a picture of the nucleon at some low scale Q20, the "model scale" . Since at such low scales higher twist effects are important, the structure functions obtained in quark models do not necessarily describe the physical nucleon at Q20, but can be used as initial conditions for the Altarelli-Parisi evolution from Q20 to a larger scale, where higher twist contributions are absent. In previous works [\cite=noi] [\cite=noipl] we showed how to determine the model scale by comparing the model prediction for the valence momentum with the experimental value and found for the CCDM Q20  =  0.16 GeV2. We start from this scale the QCD evolution of our transverse polarization densities.

Being chirally odd, h1(x,Q2) does not mix with gluon distributions, which are chirally even. Thus its Q2 evolution at leading order is governed only by the process of gluon emission. The Altarelli-Parisi equation for the QCD evolution of h1(x,Q2) is

[formula]

where the leading order splitting function Ph(y) has been computed by Artru and Mekhfi [\cite=AM] and reads

[formula]

The Mellin transforms of the splitting function Ph(y) are the anomalous dimensions γ(n)h which govern the Q2 dependence of the moments of h1, [formula], according to the multiplicative rule

[formula]

where nf is the number of flavors. In particular, since γ(1)h  =   - 2 / 3, the first moment of h1 and the tensor charge [formula] decrease with Q2 as

[formula]

Hence the Q2 evolution of hq1(x,Q2) and δq(Q2) is different from that of the helicity distributions Δq(x,Q2) and of the singlet axial charge ΔΣ(Q2). The latter is constant in Q2, being related to the matrix element of a conserved current. Therefore, although all existing model calculations (including ours) give results for hq1 very close to those obtained for Δq, one should keep in mind that this scenario is valid only at the model scale Q20. At typical experimental scales hq1 and Δq are different in magnitude and shape as they have evolved differently from similar inputs, and the assumption hq1≃Δq is no longer tenable.

The evolved distribution functions at Q2  =  25 GeV2 are also shown in Figs. 1-2. The tensor charges at this scale are: δu  =  0.969,  δd  =    -  0.250.

To illustrate the different evolution of the longitudinal and the transverse polarization distributions we compare hu1 and Δu in Fig. 3. It is evident that, although at Q20 the two distributions are almost identical, after the evolution they are largely different at small x. In particular, the transverse distribution is considerably smaller than the longitudinal one for x  <  0.1. A similar situation occurs for the d distributions.

Let us turn now to the possible determination of h1. The most promising way to detect the transverse polarization distribution is to measure the double-spin asymmetry in the Drell-Yan process with two transversely polarized proton beams. This quantity is given by (see e.g. [\cite=Ji]):

[formula]

where we have labeled by a,b the two incoming protons, the virtuality M2 of the quark and antiquark distributions is the squared mass of the produced dilepton pair, and xa,xb,M2 are related to the center of mass energy [formula] by xaxb  =  M2  /  s. The partonic asymmetry aTT is calculable in perturbative QCD [\cite=RS] and varies between - 1 and 1. The double longitudinal asymmetry ALL has an expression similar to ([\ref=ATT]), with the transverse distributions replaced by the longitudinal distributions Δq(x,M2).

In Fig. 4 we show our predictions for ATT / aTT at [formula] GeV2 and for various M2 values. For comparison ALL / aLL is also shown. Notice that the transverse asymmetry is an increasing function of the dilepton squared mass; however it remains about one order of magnitude smaller than the longitudinal asymmetry. In Fig. 5 we present ATT for xa - xb = 0 as a function of the center of mass energy: one can see that increasing [formula] leads to a further depletion of ATT. The difference between ALL and ATT is an effect of the different evolution of h1 and Δq in the small-x region, which dominates the Drell-Yan asymmetries.

The present calculation leads us to conclude that ATT is much smaller than it was expected on the basis of naive estimates. This is confirmed by a model-independent study of Drell-Yan asymmetries which will be reported in a separate paper. The extraction of h1 is then a major challenge for experimentalists but is certainly worth attempting as it can add an important piece of information to our knowledge of the proton.
