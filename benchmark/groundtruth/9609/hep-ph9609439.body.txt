Abstract

We extract the deep inelastic scattering cross-sections ratio R = σL  /  σT in the range 10- 4  ≤  x  ≤  10- 1 from F2 HERA data using very simple relations based on perturbative QCD. The result depends on only one parameter δ, being x-  δ the behavior of the parton densities at low x, which has been determined recently with a good accuracy by the H1 group.

In recent years the behaviour of deep inelastic lepton-hadron scattering (DIS) at the small values of Bjorken variable x, has been intensively studied. The present letter is devoted to the behaviour of the ratio of cross-sections of the absorption of a longitudinal- and transverse-polarized photon by hadron: R = σL  /  σT, at small values of x. The ratio R, which may be represented as the combination of the longitudinal FL(x,Q2) and transverse F2(x,Q2) DIS structure functions (SF):

[formula]

is a very sensitive QCD characteristic because it is equal to zero in the parton model with spin- 1 / 2 partons (it is very large with spin- 0 partons). However, modern DIS experimental data (see the review in [\cite=1]) are not accurate enough to determine R(x,Q2). In addition, at small values of x, R data are not yet available, as they require a rather cumbersome procedure (see [\cite=1.5], for example) for the extraction from the experiment.

We study the behaviour of R(x,Q2) at small values of x, using the H1 data [\cite=F2H1] [\cite=H1PREP95] and the method [\cite=2] of replacement of the Mellin convolution by ordinary products. By analogy with the case of the gluon distribution function (see [\cite=H1PREP95] [\cite=ZEUSGLU95] [\cite=EKL] [\cite=KOPA]) it is possible to obtain the relation between FL(x,Q2), F2(x,Q2) and dF2(x,Q2) / dlnQ2 at small x. Thus, the small x behaviour of the ratio R(x,Q2) can be extracted directly from the measured values of F2(x,Q2) and its derivative. These extracted values of R may be well considered as new small x "experimental data" c. Moreover, when experimental data for R at small x become available with a good accuracy, a violation of this exactly perturbative relation will be an indication of the importance of other effects as higher twist contribution and/or of non-perturbative QCD dynamics at small x.

We follow the notation of our previous work in refs. [\cite=KOPA] [\cite=KOPAFL]. The singlet quark s(x,Q20) and gluon g(x,Q20) parton distribution functions (PDF) d at some Q20 are parameterized by (see, for example, [\cite=4]):

[formula]

The value of δ is a matter of controversy. The "conventional" choice is δ = 0, which leads to a non-singular behaviour of the PDF when x  →  0. Another value, [formula], was obtained in the studies performed in ref. [\cite=6] as the sum of the leading powers of ln (1 / x) in all orders of perturbation theory. Experimentally, recent NMC data [\cite=7] favor small values of δ. This result is also in agreement with present data for pp and [formula] total cross-sections (see [\cite=8]) and corresponds to the model of Landshoff and Nachtmann pomeron [\cite=9] with the exchange of a pair of non-perturbative gluons, yielding δ = 0.086. However, the new HERA data [\cite=F2H1] [\cite=ZEUSGLU95] prefer δ  ≥  0.2. For example, the δ value obtained recently by H1 group [\cite=F2H1] seems to depend slowly on Q2 values. Its average value increases from δ  =  0.228 at Q2  =  8.5 GeV2 to δ  =  0.503 at Q2  =  800 GeV2.

Further, we restrict the analysis to the case of large δ values (i.e. x-  δ  ≫  1 ) following recent H1 data [\cite=F2H1]. The more complete analysis concerning to the extraction of the longitudinal SF FL(x,Q2), may be found in [\cite=KOPAFL], where we took into account also the case δ  ~  0 corresponding to the standard pomeron.

Assuming the Regge-like behaviour for the gluon distribution and F2(x,Q2) at x-  δ  ≫  1:

[formula]

we obtain the following equation for the Q2 derivative of the SF F2 e:

[formula]

where rηsp(α) and rηLp(α) are the combinations of the anomalous dimensions of Wilson operators γηsp  =  αγ(0),ηsp  +  α2γ(1),ηsp  +  O(α3) and Wilson coefficients f [formula] and αBp,η2  +  O(α2) of the η "moment" (i.e., the corresponding variables extended from integer values of argument to non-integer ones):

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] is the sum of squares of quark charges.

With accuracy of O(x2 - δ), we have for Eq.([\ref=2.1])

[formula]

with ξsg  =  r1 + δsg / rδsg and ξLg  =  r1 + δLg / rδLg.

From Eq.([\ref=5]) and ([\ref=5.1]) one can obtain FL as a function of F2 and the derivative

[formula]

where the result is restricted to O(x2 - δ,αx1 - δ). To arrive to the above equation we have performed the substitution

[formula]

and neglected the term ~  s̃'(xξsg,Q2).

This replacement is very useful. The NLO anomalous dimensions γ(1),nsp are singular in both points, n = 1 and n = 0, and their presence into the arguments of p̃(x,Q2) makes the numerical agreement between this approximate formula and the exact calculation worse (we have checked this point using some MRS sets [\cite=4] of parton distributions).

Using NLO approximation of r1 + δsp and r1 + δLp for concrete values of δ  =  0.5 and δ  =  0.3 we obtain (for f=4 and [formula] scheme):

[formula]

With the help of Eqs. ([\ref=0.1]) and ([\ref=10.1])-([\ref=10.3]) we have extracted the ratio R(x,Q2) from H1 1994 data [\cite=F2H1], determining the slopes dF2/dlnQ2 from straight line fits as in ref. [\cite=H1PREP95] [\cite=ZEUSGLU95]. In the present calculation only statistical errors have been taken into account, and we have used [formula] in the calculation of the running coupling constant αs(Q2) at two loops.

Figure 1a shows the extracted ratio R at Q2  =  20 GeV2 for two different values of the parameter δ. It also shows BCDMS [\cite=BCDMS] and preliminary CCFR (see [\cite=CCFR]) data points where the errors are very much larger. For comparison we have also plotted various predictions for R using QCD formulas at O(α2s) [\cite=FLNLO] and parton densities extracted from fits to HERA data. The large difference between the result from MRS(G) and the latest set MRS(R1) [\cite=MRS96] shows, as it is expected, the large effect on R of the unknown of the gluon distribution at small x.

In figure 1a one can also see that the result from MRS(R1) fits very well the points obtained with δ = 0.5 for the lowest x data, although it fails to account for the highest x bins. The calculation with MRS(D-) is also statistically compatible with our data.

By other part recent theoretical predictions on R based on conventional NLO DGLAP evolution analysis of HERA data (LBY) [\cite=LBY] and on the dipole picture of BFKL dynamics (NPRW) [\cite=NPRW], both finding values δ = 0.3, lie closer to the data points obtained with δ = 0.3 Eq. ([\ref=10.3]).

Finally Fig. 1b shows R for δ = 0.3 (the value favoured by H1 data [\cite=F2H1]) and at three different Q2 values in comparison with the SLAC R(1990) parametrization [\cite=RSLAC]. One can see the very good agreement at x  ≤  10- 2 even if only the statistical errors are taken into account.

Notice that the points at the same x and different Q2 are correlated by the form in which the derivative term dF2 / dlnQ2 is determined.

In summary, we have presented Eqs. ([\ref=0.1]) and ([\ref=8])-([\ref=10.3]) for the extraction of the ratio R = σL  /  σT at small x from the SF F2 and its Q2 derivative. These equations provide the possibility of the non-direct determination of R. This is important since the direct extraction of R from experimental data is a cumbersome procedure (see [\cite=1.5]). Moreover, the fulfillment of Eqs. ([\ref=0.1]), ([\ref=8])-([\ref=10.3]) by DIS experimental data is a cross-check of perturbative QCD at small values of x. Our formulas can also be used as a parametrization of R as a function of the most widely used phenomenological F2.

We have found that the results depend on the concrete value of the slope δ. In the case δ  =  0.3, which is very close to the values obtained by H1 group [\cite=F2H1] at the considered Q2 interval, we found very good agreement with the SLAC parametrization [\cite=RSLAC] and also a relatively good agreement with the studies based on NLO DGLAP and BFKL dynamics (see [\cite=LBY] and [\cite=NPRW], respectively). However the calculation performed with the latest sets of HERA parton densities using perturbative QCD at second order (see MRS(R1) curve in Fig. 1a) predicts an slightly higher value for R.
