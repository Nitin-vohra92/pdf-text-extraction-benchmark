The revival structure of wave packets is examined for quantum systems having energies that depend on two nondegenerate quantum numbers. For such systems, the evolution of the wave packet is controlled by two classical periods and three revival times. These wave packets exhibit quantum beats in the initial motion as well as new types of long-term revivals. The issue of whether fractional revivals can form is addressed. We present an analytical proof showing that at certain times equal to rational fractions of the revival times the wave packet can reform as a sum of subsidiary waves and that both conventional and new types of fractional revivals can occur.

Among the distinctive quantum features of wave-packet evolution in a potential is the formation of fractional revivals. These appear when the packet reforms as a sum of distinct subsidiary waves some time after its initial collapse. Fractional revivals have been observed experimentally in the motion of atomic Rydberg wave packets [\cite=yeazell3] [\cite=meacher] [\cite=wals] and in molecular vibrational wave packets [\cite=stolow]. In these systems, the wave packet is formed via excitation with a short laser pulse, and its motion is detected using a pump-probe configuration [\cite=az]. The revival structure of a free hydrogenic wave packet is determined by the dependence of the component-eigenstate energies on the principal quantum number. Similarly, the vibrational states of a molecular wave packet depend only on the vibrational quantum number.

For the case of quantum systems with energies depending only on one quantum number n, a generic proof has been given showing that fractional revivals form [\cite=ap]. The proof applies to packets that are a superposition of states strongly peaked around a central value n̄ of n. Initially, the motion of a wave packet of this type is periodic with period Tcl equal to the period of the corresponding classical motion. After several classical periods, the wave packet spreads and collapses. The subsequent formation of revivals is characterized by a time scale trev called the revival time. Fractional revivals occur at times that are rational fractions of trev. The associated subsidiary wave packets exhibit a periodicity in their motion equal to a fraction of Tcl.

A full revival can be viewed as a special fractional revival occurring when the wave packet reforms as a single entity evolving with the classical periodicity. For quantum systems with energies that are quadratic in n, the full revivals are perfect in the sense that the wave function at time t  =  trev is exactly equal to the wave function at t  =  0 [\cite=bkp]. For other systems the revivals at t  =  trev are imperfect, and new structure emerges after several cycles of collapse and revival. A detailed analysis involves introducing a superrevival time scale tsr and showing that the interplay between tsr and trev results in a new sequence of fractional and full superrevivals for t  ≫  trev [\cite=sr]. Among these, on time scales much larger than the superrevival time scale tsr, are the long-term revivals already predicted in early work on Rydberg wave packets [\cite=ps] that appear when the phase in the wave function is an integer multiple of 2π [\cite=peres].

The above analyses can be applied provided the physics of the wave packet is controlled by a single quantum number. As an example, consider a radial Rydberg wave packet in an alkali-metal atom. The energies of the atom have quantum defects and hence depend on more than one quantum number. However, for large enough principal quantum number and fixed angular-momentum quantum number, the quantum defects are constant to an excellent approximation. The fractional revival and superrevival structure of a wave packet formed as a superposition of, for example, p states can therefore be treated using the above methods [\cite=sr] taking the quantum-defect shifts into account analytically [\cite=sqdt]. A theoretical description of these wave packets as squeezed states can be used to extend the treatment to elliptical wave packets in alkali-metal atoms [\cite=squeezed].

To study more complicated cases, such as Rydberg wave packets in external fields, an analysis is required that allows for nondegenerate energies depending on more than one quantum number. This is the topic of the present paper.

We focus attention here on the dynamics of a wave packet Ψ(t) formed as a coherent superposition of states φn1n2 with energies En1n2 depending on two quantum numbers n1 and n2:

[formula]

Here, cn1n2 are complex weighting coefficients. Note that n1 and n2 may represent effective quantum numbers in, for instance, a perturbative treatment, for which the states φn1n2 may be only approximate energy eigenstates. Our analysis in the present work is therefore relevant for experiments studying the behavior of Rydberg wave packets in external fields, where the energy degeneracy in the superposition of states is lifted [\cite=noordam] [\cite=walther] [\cite=broers] [\cite=lankhui] [\cite=bucksbaum].

We suppose that the superposition is weighted around central values n̄1 and n̄2 of the two quantum numbers. The weighting coefficients cn1n2 are therefore taken to be strongly peaked around a central value of the energy En̄1n̄2, as would result from an excitation process using short laser pulses. The energy can then be expanded in a Taylor series as

[formula]

Since the energy depends on two variables, the expansion contains a mixed derivative term at second order.

When Eq. ([\ref=Taylor]) is substituted into ([\ref=psit]) and an irrelevant overall phase is disregarded, it follows that each derivative term corresponds to a distinct time scale. We define

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where we have assumed for simplicity that the quantum numbers take integer-spaced values. For each quantum number, there is a classical period and a revival time scale. In addition, the mixed derivative term generates a third time scale t(12)rev, which we call the cross-revival time. This term has no analog in the conventional revival structure of free Rydberg wave packets. Keeping terms to second order then gives for Ψ(t) the expression

[formula]

where k1  =  (n1  -  n̄1), k2  =  (n2  -  n̄2), and where the coefficients ck1k2 and eigenstates φk1k2 are related to the analogous quantities in Eq. ([\ref=psit]) by shifts in the subscripts.

Consider the time evolution of the wave packet. When t is small, the dominant terms in the time-dependent phase in Eq. ([\ref=psiexpans]) are the first two. They produce beating between the classical periods T(1)cl and T(2)cl. The latter are said to be commensurate if

[formula]

where a and b are relatively prime integers. When the classical periods are commensurate, the wave-packet displays a period on short time scales given by

[formula]

If two classical periods are incommensurate, the initital motion of Ψ(t) is not exactly periodic.

On larger time scales the three quantities t(1)rev, t(2)rev, and t(12)rev play a role in controlling the behavior, eventually inducing the wave-packet collapse. It follows from the form of the three second-order terms in the time-dependent phase that full revivals appear if the three revival times t(1)rev, t(2)rev, and t(12)rev are commensurate and satisfy

[formula]

where c, d and e, f are pairs of relatively prime integers.

When Eq. ([\ref=relcdef]) is obeyed, there is a time t  =  trev at which all three second-order terms in the phase become integer multiples of 2π. Near this time, a full revival occurs: the phase is governed once more by the first-order terms, so the wave-packet motion and shape resemble those of the initial wave packet. Typically, the full revival time trev is a multiple of t(1)rev, t(2)rev, and t(12)rev. However, it may equal one or more of the three component revival times for particular values of the integers in ([\ref=relcdef]).

The appearance of fractional revivals requires that the wave function Ψ(t) in Eq. ([\ref=psiexpans]) be expressible as a sum of subsidiary wave functions. This is possible only at times t = tfrac that are simultaneously irreducible rational fractions of all three revival time scales. We therefore write the fractional-revival time scale as

[formula]

Here, the pairs of integers (p1,q1), (p2,q2), and (p12,q12) are relatively prime. Note that the condition ([\ref=relcdef]) for the appearance of a full revival is automatically fulfilled if times tfrac can be found that satisfy Eq. ([\ref=tfrac]). The formation of full revivals is therefore a special case in the analysis below.

If a set of integers obeying ([\ref=tfrac]) exists, then the issue of the appearance of fractional revivals at t = tfrac becomes pertinent. To make further progress, we introduce a doubly-periodic function depending only on the classical time scales:

[formula]

Here, t1 and t2 are dummy variables. The function ψcl(t1,t2) is periodic in t1 and t2 with periods T(1)cl and T(2)cl, respectively:

[formula]

[formula]

The functions ψcl(t1,t2) have no immediate physical significance. However, at the time t  =  t1  =  t2 the function ψcl(t,t) is equal to the wave function Ψ(t) of Eq. ([\ref=psiexpans]) when the second-order terms in the phase are omitted. Thus, the functions ψcl(t,t) exhibit the beating of T(1)cl and T(2)cl. Note that Ψ(0)  =  ψcl(0,0), so for small times the behavior of Ψ(t) is approximately matched by that of ψcl(t,t).

The functions ψcl(t1,t2) are useful because we can prove that, near the times tfrac given in Eq. ([\ref=tfrac]), the wave packet Ψ(t) can be written as a sum of subsidiary waves ψcl with arguments shifted relative to t by certain fractions of the corresponding periods. The proof involves examining the cyclic properties in k1 and k2 of the second-order terms in the time-dependent phase of Ψ(t) and demonstrating that the functions ψcl with shifted arguments have identical cyclic properties. The result means that the ψcl with shifted arguments form an acceptable basis for the expansion of Ψ(t) at the times tfrac.

To examine the cyclic properties in k1 and k2 of the second-order contributions to the time-dependent phase in Ψ(t) at t  =  tfrac, we write these contributions as [formula], where

[formula]

We seek the minimum periods l1 and l2 such that

[formula]

Note that the relations

[formula]

follow from ([\ref=tfrac]) with

[formula]

The periods l1 and l2 must then satisfy

[formula]

[formula]

These relations can be satisfied by choosing l1  =  q1s1 and l2  =  q2s2. However, smaller values might exist if cancellations occur in some ratios.

The second-order contributions θk1k2 are cyclic in k1 and k2 with periods l1 and l2, respectively. The functions ψcl(t  +  s1T(1)cl  /  l1,t  +  s2T(2)cl  /  l2) with shifted arguments have the same periodicities in k1 and k2. Here, ψcl is defined in Eq. ([\ref=psicl12]) and [formula] and [formula]. This suggests the set of functions ψcl with shifted arguments can be used as a basis for an expansion of Ψ(t) near the time tfrac.

Explicitly, the wave packet at the times t  ≈  tfrac can be written as

[formula]

The integers l1 and l2 depend on the values of tfrac. They are obtained by solving the conditions ([\ref=cond1]) and ([\ref=cond2]). The coefficients as1s2 are given by

[formula]

where θκ1κ2 is given by Eq. ([\ref=theta12]). If the expressions for as1s2 and the ψcl are substituted into Eq. ([\ref=fracrev]), the expansion reduces to Eq. ([\ref=psiexpans]) evaluated at the time t = tfrac, which completes the proof.

The expansion in ([\ref=fracrev]) shows that the wave packet can be written as a sum of subsidiary wave functions at t  ≈  tfrac. However, it can be seen from Eq. ([\ref=fracrev]) that the subsidiary wave functions typically have distinct shifts in the two arguments and hence do not follow the initial evolution of Ψ(t), which is given by ψcl(t,t). Nonetheless, if near these times the shifted subsidiary wave functions are macroscopically distinct and localized in space, then Ψ(t) has a periodicity that is a fraction of the classical time periods.

The detailed behavior of the fractional revivals is governed by the form of the expansion coefficients as1s2 given in Eq. ([\ref=ass]). These coefficients depend on the function θk1k2 defined in Eq. ([\ref=theta12]), which in turn depends on the commensurability of the three component revival times. An interesting special case occurs if the cross-derivative term in the energy expansion vanishes, ∂2E  /  ∂n1∂n2  =  0, whereupon there is no cross-revival time t(12)rev. The coefficients as1s2 can then be written as a product a(1)s1a(2)s2, where a(1)s1 and a(2)s2 each separately have the form of expansion coefficients for the conventional fractional revivals [\cite=ap]. Nonvanishing values of a(1)s1 acquire the same norm for all s1. The same holds for a(2)s2. This means that for zero cross-revival time the coefficients as1s2 are equal to a product of the corresponding coefficients for systems with conventional fractional revivals. Nonetheless, the function ψcl in Eq. ([\ref=psicl12]) cannot be separated into a product of one-dimensional functions unless there is no entanglement of the states in the superposition. Only in this special case can the fractional revivals for systems with energies that depend on two quantum numbers be written as a product of two conventional fractional revivals. We refer to superpositions having these special properties as totally separable wave packets. For such packets, it follows that if N1 subsidiary wave packets appear for one component while N2 appear for the other, then the fractional revival for the full system consists of N1N2 subsidiary wave packets.

If the cross-revival time t(12)rev is nonzero, the expansion coefficients as1s2 cannot be written as a product a(1)s1a(2)s2. Their form is more complicated, and typically they have different norms for distinct s1 and s2. The fractional revivals are therefore less likely to cause distinctive periodicities in the autocorrelation function. However, for certain circumstances only a small number of subsidiary wave functions enter the expansion. This can happen, for example, if the values of l1 and l2 are small or if some of the as1s2 coefficients vanish. In this case, fractional periodicities should appear in the autocorrelation function.

Typically, the conditions ([\ref=tfrac]) for the existence of a time tfrac at which fractional revivals can occur are quite restrictive. For most values of t(1)rev, t(2)rev, and t(12)rev, no solution exists. However, for many systems with energies that depend on two quantum numbers and that are of experimental interest, there is at least one tunable parameter such as a field strength or a length scale. If the energy depends on the tunable parameter, then so in general do the component revival times. It may therefore be feasible to tune the system so that a particular fractional revival exists. Since only certain commensurabilities are likely to hold, a partial spectrum of fractional revivals should be seen. For different values of the tunable parameter, we expect different partial spectra of fractional revivals.

As an example of a totally separable wave packet, consider a superposition of energy states for a particle in a two-dimensional box with periodic boundary conditions. The box is taken to have lengths L1 and L2 in the x and y directions, respectively, and the mass of the particle is chosen to be that of the electron, i.e., one in atomic units. The eigenfunctions are separable in x and y, with eigenenergies En1n2  =  2π2(n21L- 21  +  n22L- 22). The wave packet is taken as a superposition of states centered on n̄1 and n̄2 with weighting coefficients cn1n2  =  c(1)n1c(2)n2, where |c(1)n1|2 and |c(2)n2|2 are both gaussian functions with widths σ1 and σ2, respectively.

Since the energy separates, there is no cross-revival time. Furthermore, since more than two derivatives of En1n2 vanish identically, there are no superrevivals for this system. This means the full revivals are perfect revivals for which the absolute square of the autocorrelation function is one [\cite=bkp]. The only nonzero revival times are T(1)cl  =  L21  /  2πn̄1, T(2)cl  =  L22  /  2πn̄2, t(1)rev  =  L21  /  π, and t(2)rev  =  L22  /  π. The commensurability of the revival times may be tuned by adjusting the ratio L21  /  L22.

For definiteness, consider a superposition with n̄1  =  n̄2  =  18 in a system with [formula] and L2  =  1. The ratio of the revival times is then t(1)rev / t(2)rev  =  3 / 4. We expect a full revival at t = trev  =  4t(1)rev  =  3t(2)rev  =  3 / π≃0.95 in atomic units. Figure 1 shows the absolute square of the autocorrelation function |A(t)|2  =  |〈Ψ(0)|Ψ(t)〉|2 as a function of time. A perfect full revival is evident at t = trev. At t  =  t(1)rev≃0.24 a.u. and t  =  3t(1)rev≃0.72 a.u., corresponding to the choices p1  /  q1  =  1, p2  /  q2  =  3 / 4, and p1  /  q1  =  3, p2  /  q2  =  9 / 4, respectively, two subsidiary wave functions form. At these times |A(t)|2  =  1 / 2, as can be seen in Fig. 1. At t  =  2t(1)rev≃0.48 a.u., corresponding to p1  /  q1  =  2 and p2  /  q2  =  3 / 2, one wave function forms in each component. However, this time t  =  t(2)rev / 2, which means the second-component subsidiary wave is a half cycle out of phase. Thus, as seen in Fig. 1, the autocorrelation A(t) is approximately zero at this time.

As a second explicit example, set L1  =  1 and [formula], keeping n̄1  =  n̄2  =  18. These dimensions produce the ratio t(1)rev / t(2)rev  =  1 / 3, and as a result different types of fractional revivals will occur. The autocorrelation function for this case is shown in Fig. 2. A perfect full revival occurs at t = trev  =  3t(1)rev  =  4t(2)rev  =  3 / π≃0.95 in atomic units. Fractional revivals consisting of three subsidiary wave functions form at multiples of t(1)rev / 2≃0.16 a.u., with the exception of the time 3t(1)rev / 2. At this time, p1  /  q1  =  3 / 2 and p2  /  q2  =  1 / 2, and each component consists of a single wave packet forming one-half cycle out of phase with the classical motion. This does not result in a perfect revival because the cycles are not equal, T(1)cl / 2  ≠  T(2)cl / 2, so the two components are out of phase. Additional fractional revivals consisting of four subsidiary wave functions are visible at times t  =  3t(1)rev / 4≃0.24 a.u. and t  =  9t(1)rev / 4≃0.72 a.u.

The analysis in this paper is experimentally testable. As an explicit example of a physical system for which the energy depends on two quantum numbers and a cross-revival time exists, we can consider a Stark wave packet. This type of packet can be produced using a static electric field applied to an atom, which shifts and splits the energy levels. Applying a short laser pulse then creates a coherent superposition of Stark levels. The energies in atomic units for hydrogen and a weak electric field are Enk  =    -  1 / 2n2  +  3nkF / 2, where n is the principal quantum number, k is the difference n1  -  n2 between the parabolic quantum numbers, and F is the magnitude of the electric-field strength.

Stark wave packets have unique features because the quantum number k is even or odd according to whether n is odd or even and because for fixed n the adjacent k values differ by two units. These properties introduce some additional complications in the analysis of fractional revivals and produce novel interference patterns in the interferograms of Stark wave packets [\cite=swp]. A second-order Taylor expansion of the energy Enk with respect to n and k can still be performed, but some changes occur in the definitions of the controlling time scales. Since the quantum number k is either even or odd, a Stark wave packet effectively evolves as two separate wave packets. At the fractional revival times, the packet separates into sums over sets of subsidiary wave functions consisting of superpositions of even-n and odd-n states. These wave functions evolve with distinct relative phases and obey distinct periodicity relations. This results in additional interference patterns in the autocorrelation function, which can be tested experimentally.
