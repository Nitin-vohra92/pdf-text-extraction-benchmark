Szegö Kernels and Finite Group Actions

Abstact. In the context of almost complex quantization, a natural generalization of algebro-geometric linear series on a compact symplectic manifold has been proposed. Here we suppose given a compatible action of a finite group and consider the linear subseries associated to the irreducible representations of G, give conditions under which these are base-point free and study properties of the associated projective morphisms. The results obtained are new even in the complex projective case.

Introduction

Let (M,ω) be a compact symplectic manifold of dimension 2n, such that [formula]. Fix J∈J(M,ω) (the contractible space of all almost complex structures on M compatible with ω), and let h and g = R(h) be the induced hermitian and riemannian structures. There exist an hermitian line bundle (A,h) on M and a unitary covariant derivative [formula] on A, such that - 2πiω is the curvature of [formula]. In this set-up, studying the asymptotic spectral properties of a suitable renormalized laplacian, Guillemin and Uribe have introduced privileged spaces of sections [formula]; if J is integrable and A holomorphic and ample, these are the spaces of holomorphic sections of [formula] [\cite=bg], [\cite=gu], [\cite=bu1]. These linear series determine projective embeddings of M enjoying the same metric and symplectic asymptotic properties as in the integrable projective case [\cite=bu2], [\cite=z1], [\cite=sz], [\cite=t].

Suppose that G is a finite group with a symplectic action ν:G  ×  M  →  M, so that J may be chosen G-invariant. Then ν preserves g and h. Assume also that ν lifts to a linear action :G  ×  A  →  A, and that [formula] preserves hA and [formula]. Then [formula] preserves each of the spaces [formula]. Let ρi:G  →  GL(Vi), 1  ≤  i  ≤  c, be the irreducible representations of G; we shall assume that i = 1 corresponds to the trivial one-dimensional representation. For each N, we have a G-equivariant decomposition [formula], where [formula] consists of a direct sum of copies of Vi. It is natural to ask whether the linear series [formula] are base point free and, if so, what about their asymptotic properties? In this note, we apply arguments from [\cite=bu2] and [\cite=z1], [\cite=sz] to these questions.

If x∈M, let Gx  =  {g∈G:g  ·  x = x} be its stabiliser. Let [formula] be the character of the i-th irreducible representation. Let Ax be the fibre of A over x∈M. Clearly, Gx acts on Ax and thus we have a unitary character [formula]. Let

[formula]

(  ,  )Gx denoting the L2-product with respect to the counting measure on Gx. Note that γi,N  =  γi,N + |G| for every i and N, where |G| denotes the order of G. Set

[formula]

Clearly, x∈Bi,N implies Gx  ≠  {e}.

Our first goal is to determine the base locus of the spaces of sections [formula] for k  ≫  0. In algebro-geometric terminology, the base locus of a vector subspace [formula] is

[formula]

To begin with, we shall prove:

Suppose 1  ≤  i  ≤  c, 0  ≤  r  ≤  |G| - 1, x∈M and γi,r(x)  ≠  0. Then for N  ≫  0, [formula] (mod |G|) there exists a section [formula] such that s(x)  ≠  0.

This has a number of consequences:

Suppose that the action of G on M is effective. Then

[formula]

for every [formula] and every k  ≫  0.

In fact, it is proved in [\cite=pao] that under the same hypothesis

[formula]

Suppose 1  ≤  i  ≤  c, 0  ≤  r  ≤  |G| - 1, and γi,r(x)  ≠  0 for every x∈M. Then [formula] globally generates [formula] if k  ≫  0 and [formula] (mod |G|), that is, for every x∈M there is [formula] such that s(x)  ≠  0.

If k  ≫  0 and [formula], the subspace of G-invariant sections

[formula]

globally generates [formula].

If M is a complex projective manifold and A is ample, for every [formula] and [formula] the base loci [formula] stabilize for k  ≫  0. Furthermore, for every k  ≫  0,

[formula]

In the reverse direction, it is easily seen that if Gx = G and there exists [formula] with s(x)  ≠  0, then

[formula]

Therefore,

In the hypothesis of Corollary [\ref=cor:3], suppose in addition that either Gx  =  {e} or Gx = G for every x∈G. Then

[formula]

for [formula] and N  ≫  0.

In the almost complex case, for any [formula] and [formula] we may still define the (i,r)-th equivariant asymptotic base locus of A as

[formula]

The general case (symplectic, almost complex) of Corollary [\ref=cor:3] is then

In the above situation,

[formula]

If furthermore K  ⊂  M is any compact subset with [formula], then

[formula]

for all k  ≫  0 with [formula].

Next, if [formula] there are associated projective morphisms

[formula]

and we now consider their asymptotic properties as k  →    +    ∞  .

Suppose [formula] for some 1  ≤  i  ≤  c and 0  ≤  r  ≤  |G| - 1. Let U  ⊆  M be the open subset of M where the order |Gx| is locally constant. Suppose U'  ⊂  U is open with [formula]. Then Φi,r + k|G| is an immersion on U' for k  ≫  0.

[formula] is base point free and Φ1,N is an immersion on compact subsets of U if N  ≫  0 and [formula] for every x∈G.

In general Φi,N is not injective; for example it is constant on every orbit for any G if i corresponds to the trivial representation, or for any i if G is abelian. We may still ask, however, if in these cases points in different orbits have different images under Φi,N.

Let [formula] be the orbit distance:

[formula]

Clearly, dG(x,y) > 0 if and only if [formula].

Assume that either G is abelian, or G is arbitrary and i = 1. Let U  ⊆  M be as in Theorem [\ref=thm:main1], [formula] and suppose that [formula] and that γi,N is constant on W. Let K  ⊆  W be a compact subset. There exists [formula] such that if k  ≥  k0, x,y∈K and dG(x,y) > 0 then

[formula]

If the action of G on M is free, then Φi,N is well-defined and an embedding [formula] for any [formula] and N  ≫  0.

Similar statements hold for the asymptotic metric and almost complex properties, in the vein of theorem 1.1 of [\cite=bu2].

Proofs

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main1]. We recall some notation from [\cite=bu2], [\cite=z1], [\cite=sz]. Let A* = A- 1 be the dual line bundle with the induced hermitian stucture hA*, and let [formula] be the unit circle bundle, a strictly pseudoconvex domain. Given the connection, [formula] has natural riemannian and almost CR structures. We shall identify functions and half-forms throughout.

As [formula] is a principal S1-bundle, [formula], where [formula] is the N-th isotype for the S1-action. In the standard manner, we shall identify [formula] and [formula]. Set [formula], where [formula] under this identification; in the integrable projective case, [formula] is the Hardy space of boundary values of holomorphic functions on A*. Let [formula] be the orthogonal projector and [formula] its Schwartz kernel; decompose it as [formula], where [formula] is the N-th Fourier coefficent. We have [formula], where [formula] is an orthonormal basis of [formula]. Let [formula] be the coherent state map, given by evaluation, which is a lifting of Φi,N when the latter is defined. Then [formula] ([formula]), where (  ·    ,  ·  ) denotes the L2-hermitian product on [formula].

The induced action of G on A* preserves [formula] and the riemannian and almost CR structures on [formula], and the isomorphisms [formula] are G-equivariant. For N  ≫  0, we have G-equivariant decompositions [formula], where [formula] is the factor consisting of a direct sum of copies of Vi, 1  ≤  i  ≤  c. Similarly, [formula]. We shall implicitly identify [formula] and [formula] with [formula] and [formula], respectively. For each i, let [formula] denote the orthogonal projection and let [formula] be its Schwartz kernel. For each i and N, let [formula] be the orthogonal pojection and i,N its Schwartz kernel, the N-th Fourier coefficient of i: if [formula] is an orthonormal basis of [formula], then

[formula]

Clearly, [formula]. Notice that the Fourier components of the total and equivariant Szegö kernels, ΠN and Πi,N, when restricted to the diagonal in [formula] descend to well-defined smooth functions on the diagonal in M  ×  M, that is, we may write with some abuse of language ΠN(p,p) = ΠN(x,x) and Πi,N(p,p) = Πi,N(x,x) for any [formula] and x∈M with π(p) = x. This will be done implicitly below.

By the projection formula, for each [formula] we have

[formula]

where [formula] is the induced representation; explicitly, [formula] ([formula]), where we view g- 1 as a contactomorphism of [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

On the diagonal, [formula]. Let d be the geodesic distance function on M and also its pull-back [formula] to [formula]. If x∈M and G  ·  x  ≠  {x}, set [formula]. Suppose [formula], x = π(p). Then

[formula]

By Lemma 4.5 of [\cite=bu2], the latter term is bounded in absolute value by CN(p,p)e- a2xN / 2 + O(N(n - 1) / 2), where C is independent of x and N. By (13) of [\cite=sz0] and the definition of dual action, N(g- 1p,p) = αx(g)NN(p,p) if g∈Gx. Thus the former term is

[formula]

Given the asymptotic expansion for N(p,p) in [\cite=bu2] and [\cite=z1], i,N(p,p)  ≠  0 if N  ≫  0, [formula]. This clearly implies the statement.

Proof Of Corollary [\ref=cor:1]. Let V  ⊆  M be the locus of points with non-trivial stabilizer. By Theorem 8.1 on page 213 of [\cite=s] and because the action is effective, V is a union of proper submanifolds of M. If [formula], then Gx  =  {e} and therefore γi,k(x) =  dim (Vi)  ≠  0 for every i and N. By the Theorem, there exists [formula] with s(x)  ≠  0 if k  ≫  0.

Before coming to the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:1], let us dwell on the previous descrition of the equivariant Szegö kernels i,k restricted to the diagonal. As is well-known, the wave front of the Szegö kernel Π is

[formula]

In the notation of [\cite=bg], [\cite=bu2] we have in fact [formula]. Now we have seen that

[formula]

For any g∈G let [formula] be the diffeomorphism (p,q)  ↦  (g  p,q), and let [formula], where α*g denotes pull-back of functions under αg. Then [formula] and k(g  p,q) is the k-th Fourier component of g, for every integer k. One can then see, arguing as in the proofs of Lemmas 3.5 and 3.6 of [\cite=bu2], that k- nk(g  p,p) is bounded in C1 norm, say, for every g∈G. The same then holds for k- ni,k(x,x).

Proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:1]. By the above, in the hypothesis of the Proposition for every x∈M there exists [formula] such that [formula] for every k  ≥  kx. We now make the stronger claim that for every x∈M there exist an open neighbourhood Ux of x and [formula] such that [formula] for every k  ≥  kx. The statement will follow given the compactness of M.

If the claim was false, there would exist x∈M and sequences [formula] and xj∈M ([formula]) with [formula] (mod |G|), kj  →    +    ∞   and xj  →  x, such that [formula] for every j. Thus,

[formula]

while

[formula]

where L.O.T. denotes lower order terms in kj. Thus, k- nj  i,kj(x,x) is bounded away from zero and therefore the derivatives in x of the sequence of functions k- nj  i,kj(x',x') are unbounded, a contradiction.

Proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:2]. Let us agree that the irreducible representation corresponding to i = 1 is just the trivial representation, so that

[formula]

for every integer N. Then [formula] for every g∈G. Furthermore, for every x∈M, g∈Gx and [formula] we have αk|G|x(g) = 1. Thus

[formula]

and the statement follows from Proposition [\ref=prop:1].

Proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:3]. If M is a complex projective manifold and A is ample, we have section multiplication maps

[formula]

for every [formula] and integers [formula]. Thus, for any residue class 0  ≤  r  ≤  |G| - 1 and any sequence of positive integers ki  ≫  0, by Corollary [\ref=cor:2] we have a descending chain of base loci:

[formula]

This implies the first statement. The rest is obvious.

Proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:4]. If Gx = G and [formula] (mod. |G|), then

[formula]

Thus, if γi,r(x) = 0 then s(x) = 0 for every [formula].

Proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:5]. The first statement follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:main1], while the second is a consequence of the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:1].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:2]. Suppose [formula] so that, perhaps after replacing N by N + k|G| for k  ≫  0, [formula] is base point free. The claim is that if U'  ⊂  U is open with compact closure in U and N  ≫  0, then Φi,N is an immersion on U'. We shall be done by proving that N- 1Φ*i,N(ω(N)FS) - ω = O(1 / N) on connected compact subsets of U, where ω(N)FS is the Fubini-Study symplectic form on [formula]. In turn, this will follow if we prove that N- 1*i,N(N) - π*(ω) = O(1 / N) on horizontal vectors, over compact subsets of [formula]; here [formula] on [formula] (with its natural hermitian structure), and [formula] is the projection.

Now, if d1 and d2 denote exterior differentiation on the first and second component of [formula], respectively, then N- 1*i,NN  =  diag*(d1d2 log i,N), where [formula] is the diagonal map ([\cite=sz], proof of theorem 3.1 (b)). If x,y∈M lie in the same connected component V of U, Gy = Gx. Thus bx: = (αNx,χi)Gx is constant on V, say equal to bV. Hence, if p,q∈π- 1(V) and x = π(p),

[formula]

By the proof of theorem 3.1 (b) of [\cite=sz], [formula] in Ck-norm for any k on M. Therefore, we shall be done by proving that

[formula]

and

[formula]

for [formula] near compact subsets of diag(V).

Let then K  ⊂  V be a compact subset, and suppose x∈K, [formula], and u,v∈TxM have unit length. Let U,V be horizontal vector fields of unit length on [formula], of unit length near [formula] and extending the horizontal lifts of u and v. We want to estimate [formula] over K, where U1 = (U,0) and V2 = (0,V) are horizontal vector fields on [formula].

Let us consider again the distribution [formula], discussed before the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:1]. If P is a horizontal differential operator of degree [formula] on [formula], its principal symbol vanishes on g*Σ and therefore [formula]. As in [\cite=bu2] Lemma 4.5, for [formula] we can find [formula], having an asymptotic development [formula], and real phase functions [formula] such that

[formula]

and [formula] Since P(g) has definite (even) parity, we may assume without loss that so does G. Therefore, the above asymptotic expansions may be assumed to go down by integer steps: [formula], and

[formula]

Because K  ⊂  U is compact and [formula] for x∈K, there is ε > 0 such that d(gp,p) > ε for all p∈π- 1(K). Thus, [formula] on π- 1(K). Developping [formula], we see that [formula] over K, uniformly in U and V. This proves ([\ref=eqn:pepe']); the proof of the other estimate is similar.

Proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:main2]. Notation being as above, we may assume that K is G-invariant. Suppose then, by contradiction, that for a sequence kj  →    +    ∞   we can find xkj,ykj∈K with dG(xkj,ykj) > 0 and Φi,N + kj|G|(xkj) = Φi,N + kj|G|(ykj). Set Nj = N + kj|G|.

I claim that [formula]. Following [\cite=bu2], proof of Corollary 4.6, pick pkj∈π- 1(xkj), qkj∈π- 1(ykj). Then i,Nj(xkj) = λji,Nj(ykj) for some [formula]; it follows that ||i,Nj(pkj)||2 = |λj|2  ·  ||i,Nj(qkj)||2. However, ||i,Nj(p)||2  =  i,Nj(p,p) ([formula]), and therefore by ([\ref=eqn:baba']) above |λj| = 1 + O(N- 1 / 2j). We also have |λj|i,Nj(pkj,pkj) = |i,Nj(pkj,qkj)|, and on the other hand, again by ([\ref=eqn:baba']),

[formula]

We conclude that [formula], as claimed. Hence, after replacing xkj by gj  ·  xkj for a suitable gj∈G, we may assume [formula] and d(xkj,ykj) = dG(xkj,ykj) for every j.

Since d(gx,x) > ε for some fixed ε > 0 and all x∈K and [formula], xkj is the only point in G  ·  xkj minimizing the distance from ykj, for every j.

We may now apply the argument of the proof of theorem 3.2 (b) of [\cite=sz], with minor changes.
