Introduction

One of the main reasons to study string theory in curved spacetime is to develop the appropriate methods to investigate physical phenomena in the presence of quantum gravity in a mathematically consistent theory. Quantum gravity is important during the early universe and this must have an impact on the symmetries and matter content (gauge bosons, families of quarks and leptons) observed at accelerator energies. In addition, in order to develop an understanding of gravitational singularities such as black holes or the big bang, including quantum aspects of gravity, string theory in curved spacetime must be investigated.

A string propagating in curved  spacetime with one time and (d - 1) space coordinates is described by a string action that has the following form in the conformal gauge

[formula]

where Gμν(X) is a background metric in d-dimensions with signature [formula] The terms in the action denoted by [formula] may contain additional background fields such as an antisymmetric tensor Bμν(X) a dilaton Φ(X) etc.. Conformal invariance must be imposed on these background fields at the quantum level, otherwise reparametrization invariance (Virasoro constraints) cannot be used to remove ghosts from the theory.

In one time plus (d - 1) space dimensions many models that are exactly conformally invariant at the quantum level have been constructed by now [\cite=BN][\cite=ibcurved][\cite=tseytlinrev]. A first example of string propagation in curved spacetime was the SL(2,R) WZW model that potentially could be solved through algebraic methods. However, one immediately came across an unexpected inconsistency problem involving the unitarity of the theory [\cite=BN][\cite=O'R]. It was noticed a long time ago that the Virasoro constraints were insufficient to remove all the negative norm states encountered in the affine current algebra treatment of the model. There seemed to be more negative norm states than those introduced by the time-like string coordinates. This problem persited with all other non-compact affine current algebra coset models, including the much studied SL(2,R)/R two dimensional black hole [\cite=BN][\cite=WIT]. This observation casted doubt on the physical validity of the models and prevented the development of physical ideas based on the algebraic properties of these (in principle) completely solvable models.

In this talk, and in a related paper [\cite=ibsl2wzw], I explain the solution of the unitarity problem. I show that the WZW model has more degrees of freedom than those described by the affine current algebra. The extra degrees of freedom are zero modes (in particular, in non-compact directions). In the old treatment one inadvertently set the zero mode to zero values, and hence missed important properties of the model. One of the important effects of the non-trivial zero mode is that the mass shell condition is altered. In the absence of the zero mode the string cannot be put correctly on mass shell and this begins to explain why the non-unitary states emerged.

To actually show that the model has no ghosts a second step is needed. In particular one must argue that the discrete series representation of SL(2,R) does not appear at the base, since in the purely algebraic approach (including the new zero mode) there would still be negative norm states in this representation, according to the old approach. To show that the WZW model excludes the discrete series, I formulate the quantum theory in terms of a suitable parametrization of SL(2,R) that corresponds to free fields, and then show that only the unitary principal series is allowed. In this formulation the spectrum is completely solved and the Virasoro constraints implemented. The no ghost theorem is then shown to be valid.

In the presence of non trivial values of the zero mode (which is needed for the correct physics) the conserved currents of the theory have logarithmic singularities on the world sheet. A priori one may think that this would imply that the closed string boundary conditions are not satisfied. However, this is not the case, because periodicity is required only on mass shell. In the presence of the new zero modes the Hilbert space is larger than before. Imposing periodicity gives quantized values for a combination of the zero modes, thus satisfying the correct closed (or open) string boundary conditions for the physical on-mass-shell states.

To arrive at these results, and also to solve the model completely, a new free field formalism is introduced as mentioned above. The structure of the currents in terms of the free fields is reminiscent of the one found by Wakimoto [\cite=wakim] and Gerasimov et. al. [\cite=gerasim], but it differs from theirs in three important aspects: (1) The free fields as well as the currents are Hermitean; this is important for the discussion of unitarity. (2) The currents have logaritmic cuts that are associated naturally with the zero modes of the free fields; this affects the spectrum and monodromy. (3) A new term, that can be present in the free field formulation to reproduce the effects of the most general SL(2,R) currents, is introduced in order to obtain all unitary representations at the base. The source of all the unwanted ghosts is traced to the new term. But, for the specific model at hand, i.e. the WZW model, the extra term is shown to be absent, thus elucidating the mechanism by which the model becomes unitary.

The unitarity problem

The SL(2,R) WZW model has a timelike coordinate that introduces negative norm oscillators. These create negative norm states, but this is not the source of the problem. On the basis of naïve counting one may hope that the Virasoro constraints will remove these ghosts from the theory (this expectation is born out in our final result). A similar situation occurs also in the flat theory. As is well known, in the flat case one can indeed prove the no ghost theorem [\cite=noghost] which implies that the theory is unitary. However, in the case of curved spacetime current algebra models, one finds that even after imposing the Virasoro constraints there remains negative norm states that render the theory non-unitary. This has been the main stumbling block that discouraged the application of these ideas to model building for the past five years.

Negative norm states that satisfy the Virasoro constraints can be displayed explicitly. An example is [\cite=BN]

[formula]

where Nj(l) =  < j,m = j + 1  |j,m = j + 1 >  is the norm of the state at the base. The base is in the discrete series representation of SL(2,R), with m  ≥  (j + 1). It is required to be in the discrete series by the mass-shell condition L0 = 1, which gives

[formula]

Evidently, for sufficiently large values of the excitation number l the norm switches between positive and negative values. Hence, despite the Virasoro constraints this model is not unitary and cannot describe a physical string.

Solution of the unitarity problem

Until now a solution to this problem, and the related SL(2,R)/R black hole problem, has not been found despite many attempts [\cite=ibstonybrook][\cite=attempts]. Suggestions included: (1) Restrict (artificially) j(l) + 1 < k / 2 so that the norm never becomes negative; (2) Allow large values of j(l) as needed by the excited level l,   but also permit the base state to have negative norm Nj(l) in such a way as to make the norm of the excited state <  φ,l|φ,l >  positive; (3) Hope that modular invariants will fix the problem. All of these suggestions are rejected [\cite=ibsl2wzw].

The resolution of the problem lies in understanding that wrong assumptions have been made about the algebraic structure of the WZW model. In particular, the assumption that the SL(2,R) WZW model is described by affine SL(2,R) is not entirely correct. There is an additional zero mode that is present in the local conserved SL(2,R) currents of the WZW model, whose presence is crucial for the resolution of the unitarity issues. This zero mode is missed by the assumption of affine currents that are written in the form of a Laurent series [formula]. When the additional zero mode is included, the true currents Ja(z) have a logarithmic term ln z in addition to the usual powers zn. Hence, manipulations such as ([\ref=negnorm],[\ref=m-shell]) based on the old affine currents a(z) do not fully reflect the correct theory, and this is why we find inadmissible unphysical results.

In general one can include such ln z parts, but still have the correct local commutation rules or operator products with only poles. To see this, let a(z) be the usual Laurent series (with the usual operator products) that have modes Jan as above, and in addition introduce a new zero mode α-0 that commutes with all the other modes Jan. The new currents are

[formula]

It can be shown that they have the usual correct operator products, with only poles, for any value of the zero mode α-0 [\cite=ibsl2wzw].

The ln z terms arise naturally in the canonical formulation of the WZW model. There are left/right moving string coordinates XL,R that parametrize the group element g(XL(z),XR()). As usual, string coordinates have a "momentum" zero mode p ln z. The currents in this model depend both on XL,R as well as on their derivatives. Therefore, the currents are expected to include ln z pieces proportional to the zero modes. This is unlike the flat theory, where the currents depend only on the derivatives of the XL,R. If one sets the p ln z parts equal to zero, as is inadverdently done by assuming affine currents in the form of Laurent series, one forces the string to lie in a sector of fixed zero mode p = 0. This may be harmless in compact directions, but it is fatal in non-compact directions. For example, for the flat string, if one requires the lightcone momentum p- = 0, then the mass-shell condition

[formula]

cannot be satisfied in that sector. In the SL(2,R) string exactly this situation arises when α-0 = 0. It turns out that, in SL(2,R), in the absence of the zero mode, which is analogous to p-, it is still possible to satisfy a mass shell condition, but only in the discrete series representation. As seen above the discrete series gives rise to ghosts. On the other hand, when the zero mode α-0  ≠  0 is included (and hence ln z is present in the currents), the mass shell condition is satisfied in the principal series representation, which is free of ghosts at the excited levels.

SL(2,R) Currents and free fields

Consider the free fields X-(z),  P+(z), [formula]. They have naïve dimensions 0,1,1,2 respectively and they are defined as follows

[formula]

These fields are Hermitean. The currents are

[formula]

The currents have a Wakimoto type structure, but with the exception that these currents are Hermitean. Furthermore, they contain two other new features: (i) the ln z parts that have the same structure as ([\ref=newold]), and (ii) the new terms [formula] It can be shown that the operator products of free fields produce the correct operator products of the currents [\cite=ibsl2wzw].

The free field commutation rules are

[formula]

while all other commutators are zero. The α±  n oscillators may be rewritten in terms of light-cone type combinations of one time-like α0n and one space-like α1n oscillator, i.e. [formula] This shows one source of negative norms, but by naive counting, they are expected to be removed by the Virasoro constraints. In fact, the usual proof of the no-ghost theorem can be extended to show that these ghosts are indeed removed [\cite=ibsl2wzw]. The zero modes q-,p±   are interpreted as light-cone type canonical variables q = x-,  p = p+. We have not introduced a canonical variable corresponding to x+, hence α-0 = p- commutes with all   the operators and acts like a constant. Similarly the zero mode s0 also acts like a constant. [formula] are simultaneously diagonalized in the Hilbert space, and they label the base.

The [formula] operators act like Virasoro operators with zero central charge. It is always possible to construct such an operator in terms of free fields, the simplest being a (negative norm) free boson with a background charge. Another example is any critical conformal field theory including the conformal ghosts with central charge c =  - 26. Both of these examples have ghosts and this is true more generally. Indeed, there is no construction of a zero central charge Virasoro operator that does not contain negative norm states in its Hilbert space. Hence, in the presence of [formula] there is an additional source of negative norms that will not be possible to be removed by the Virasoro constraints. For example a base state with the property [formula] produces a negative norm state [formula] [formula] if [formula] As we will see below only when [formula] is present and [formula] the discrete series is possible. Hence the unwanted negative norm states and the discrete series go hand-in-hand. We will show that [formula] is absent in the WZW model, hence the WZW model has no additional sources of negative norms.

Stress tensor and free fields

The energy momentum tensor is obtained from the normal ordered product of the currents

[formula]

The result of the computation gives

[formula]

If the computation is repeated with the (z) currents the only difference is dropping the α-0 term contained in

[formula]

In ([\ref=stresstensor]) TS is a Hermitean stress tensor

[formula]

The structure [formula] differs from the usual one i∂S, and thus is Hermitean. The operator products of TS(z) are

[formula]

with the central charge

[formula]

Note that the term P+i∂zX- is identical to the energy momentum tensor of flat light-cone coordinates constructed from the oscillators α±  n. Therefore, that part is mathematically equivalent to a c = 2 stress tensor constructed from one time and one space coordinate in flat spacetime. Then the total central charge is

[formula]

which is the right central charge for the SL(2,R) WZW model. Finally, as a further consistency check, by using only the operator products of the elementary fields, one finds that T(z) has the correct operator products with the currents.

The zero mode of the stress tensor takes the form [formula] where each piece has the eigenvalues

[formula]

where [formula] are positive integers and [formula] is the eigenvalue of [formula] at the base (whose possible values depend on the model for [formula]. The mass shell condition L0 = a is

[formula]

where a  ≤  1. The term p+p- is crucial since it takes negative values, as seen below.

To identify the value of the Casimir operator j(j + 1) associated with the affine currents [formula] in ([\ref=newold]) we set p- = 0, and compare the eigenvalue of the resulting L0 to the standard formula. We then see that the Casimir of the old currents (0)2 =  - j(j + 1) takes the value

[formula]

Therefore, if the [formula] piece is absent in the construction ([formula] then j =  - 1 / 2  ±  is0 is only in the principal series. The supplementary series could occur for - 1 / 4 < j(j + 1) < 0 and the discrete series occurs for - 1 / 4 < j(j + 1).   We see that the field [formula] with a positive [formula] contributes only to the principal series and with a negative [formula] it leads to the other representations as well. This construction may find various applications in the future. We will see below that [formula] is absent in the SL(2,R) WZW model, hence only the special case of our construction ([formula] finds an application in the WZW model. Then, for excited string states, since the integer in ([\ref=balancee] is positive it would not be possible to satisfy the mass shell condition in the absence of the p-. So, the logarithmic structure plays a role.

The SL(2,R) WZW model

We now relate the algebraic structures above to the WZW model for SL(2,R).

The quantum theory for any WZW model at the critical point is conveniently formulated in terms of the left and right moving currents after writing the group element g(τ,σ) = gL(τ  +  σ)  g- 1R(τ  -  σ)

[formula]

where z = ei(τ  +  σ),   = ei(τ  -  σ).    The quantum rules are most conveniently given in terms of operator products among the currents and the group elements.

[formula]

The ti is a basis for the SL(2,R) Lie algebra which is given in terms of Pauli matrices t0  =  σ2 / 2,    t1 = iσ1 / 2,    t2 =  - iσ3 / 2. They satisfy ηij =  - 2tr(titj) = diag( - 1,1,1).

Any group element gL,R in SL(2,R) can be rewritten in terms of the Gauss decomposition as follows

[formula]

We compute the left/right currents (omitting the L,R indices for simplicity)

[formula]

As compared to the classical currents ([\ref=clcur]) we have shifted [formula] in both g ([\ref=group]) and the definition of the current ([\ref=cur]), and applied normal ordering. This renormalization is necessary for the commutation rules to work out, and is consistent with similar phenomena concerning the quantization of the WZW model [\cite=ibsfeffaction]. One finds then

[formula]

The coefficient of - ik∂zX- is ambiguous because of the normal ordering of the term [formula]. Again this has to be fixed by requiring that the commutation rules work out. Therefore, instead of having naively [formula] we actually must have - ik∂zX-. These results are established by applying the canonical formalism and identifying these structures with canonical conjugate variables. Velocities must be replaced by canonical momenta. Note that for left/right movers ∂z can be related to time derivatives ∂τ or space derivatives ∂σ. So, at the quantum level we find that we must identify the canonical pairs (X-,P+) and [formula] as follows

[formula]

and then the currents take the form

[formula]

This is the form used in the previous section without the extra field [formula] Thus, as discussed before, only the principal series will emerge in the WZW model. Using the oscillator form introduced in ([\ref=fields]) we can express u(z) and X+(z) in terms of the basic oscillators sn,α+n by inverting the formulas in ([\ref=canonical]), thus

[formula]

Then these structures satisfy the operator products

[formula]

Thus, u(z) is just the canonical conjugate to S(z). Another property of X+ that follows from the fundamental operator products is that it is a singlet under the action of J2(z)

[formula]

Actually ∂X+ is a screening current (see below). Its operator products with all the currents is either zero or a total derivative. Therefore, its zero mode commutes with all the currents.

Inserting the expressions in eq.([\ref=ux]) into ([\ref=group]) we obtain the quantum operator version of the group element g. The operator products may now be evaluated. We find the correct quantum products ([\ref=quantumrules]) with the above construction in terms of oscillators. That is,

[formula]

This result, combined with the current ×   current operator products that we have proven earlier, is convincing evidence that the free field formalism that we have discussed corresponds to the quantization of the SL(2,R) WZW model.

Physical states

No ghosts

Since we have rewritten the WZW theory in terms of free fields, the space of states consists of the Fock space for the oscillators α±  n,sn applied on the base |p+,p-,s0  >   that diagonalizes the zero mode operators α±  0,s0.

[formula]

where the powers an,bm,ck are positive integers or zero. This is the space of states that provide a representation basis for the SL(2,R) currents with only the principal series. The physical states are identified as those linear combinations that are annihilated by the the total Virasoro generators

[formula]

In the present case the total Virasoro generators include the following terms

[formula]

where

[formula]

Note that the L±  n is equivalent to the c = 2 Virasoro operator in 2D flat spacetime. The full central charge is

[formula]

The eigenvalue of the total L0 is

[formula]

Thus, the theory has been reduced to a 2D lightcone in flat spacetime plus a Liouville type space-like free field that has positive norm. A small but important difference as compared to the standard Liouville formalism is that the linear term in LSn is Hermitean in our case, and does not contribute to LS0.

The only negative norm states are the ones produced by the time-like oscillator [formula] However, this is no worse than the usual flat spacetime case. The space of physical states is defined by

[formula]

with a  ≤  1 fixed. A proof of no ghosts can now be given by following step by step the same arguments that prove the no ghost theorem in flat spacetime [\cite=noghost]. There is no need to repeat it here. We only recall that there are no ghosts as long as a  ≤  1 and c  ≤  26.

Monodromy

So far we have not taken into account the physical effects of the ln z cut in the currents. At first sight, the presence of ln z in the currents appears to be contrary to the periodicity requirement of closed strings. However, this is not true. The periodicity requirement arises as a boundary condition in the process of minimizing the action. In other words only on mass shell physical string configurations are required to be periodic. In the presence of the extra zero mode the Hilbert space is larger. One must require periodicity in the physical on shell sector. The physical sector is identified as the subspace of states for which the matrix elements of the currents are periodic.

[formula]

As described below, under this requirement, it turns out that the extra zero mode must have quantized eigenvalues in the physical sector. Quantum mechanically it is possible to impose the monodromy condition simultaneously with the Virasoro constraints since the latter commute with the monodromy operator as seen below. These monodromy conditions are easily taken care of in the free field formalism, thus finally giving a complete physical unitary spectrum of the SL(2,R) WZW model.

To implement the monodromy let us first consider its effect on the currents. From the modified currents in ([\ref=newold]) we see that under the monodromy the currents undergo a linear transformation

[formula]

Note that on the right hand side one finds Ja, not a. Therefore we expect that the right hand side can be rewritten as the adjoint action with a global SL(2,R) transformation. Since the current J0(z) + J1(z) remains unchanged the generator of this transformation must be the zero mode of this current. Indeed, since α-0 acts like a number, we can rewrite the monodromy in the form

[formula]

Therefore physical states that satisfy ([\ref=monodrinv]) are the subset of states that are invariant under the monodromy

[formula]

In the free boson representation this is easy to implement. Using [formula] this condition is applied on the Fock space of the free bosons in the form

[formula]

Since α-0α+0 commutes with all oscillators, it can be moved to the right and applied on the base. The result is the quantization condition

[formula]

We must take negative integers because according to the mass shell condition p-p+ is negative. So, the mass shell condition on physical states at excitation level l takes the form

[formula]

It is always possible to satisfy this condition with some value of s0 which is quantized in terms of the positive integers r,l. In terms of the original Casimir j(j + 1) this corresponds to a principal series representation of SL(2,R) with quantized values of j given by [formula] where r must be chosen so that the square root is real.

Therefore, it is sufficient to require that j (or s0) has quantized values

[formula]

Then the on-shell physical states automatically satisfy the periodicity condition.

Open and Closed strings

An open string action [formula] is minimized by allowing free variation of the end points. For the WZW model for any group G this produces the boundary terms

[formula]

In addition to the equations of motion, these terms must also vanish at each end of the string. That is,

[formula]

At the conformal critical point the equations of motion are satisfied by the general form g(τ,σ) = gL(τ  +  σ)  g- 1R(τ  -  σ). Then the boundary conditions require that gL and gR be related to each other by the constraint

[formula]

Furthermore, each term in this equation is required to be periodic. As discussed in the rest of this paper, we impose periodicity on the physical states. The relation ([\ref=relation]) between gL(τ) and gR(τ) is not easy to solve explicitly. However, we may carry out the quantum theory in terms of one current Ĵ

[formula]

This is neither the left moving current JL  =  ∂gLg- 1L nor the right moving one JR  =  ∂gRg- 1R, but is related to them by transformations involving gL or gR.

[formula]

The current Ĵ generates transformations on the right side of gL and the left side of g- 1R, and the meaning of ([\ref=relation]) is that the total current on both gL and gR vanishes at the end points. The canonical commutation rules for this current are identical to the ones we have already discussed in the rest of the paper. The stress tensor constructed from it is equal to the stress tensor constructed from either the left movers or the right movers

[formula]

The quantum spectrum is obtained from the properties of Ĵ, whose mathematical structure is the same as either left movers or right movers as discussed in the previous sections. For an open string we choose to parametrize the Ĵ current in terms of free fields. Thus, the quantum spectrum of the open string in the SL(2,R) curved spacetime becomes identical to the spectrum discussed above.

For a closed string we have independent left and right moving sectors. The full group element is g = gL(z)g- 1R() and there are left and right moving currents. Therefore we now need two sets of oscillators, the left movers α±  n,sn, and the right movers α̃±  n,s̃n. So, the direct product Hilbert space has a base labelled by |p-,p+,s0;p̃-,p̃+,s̃0  >   with p-p+ =  - r and p̃-p̃+ =  -  to insure that the currents obey the monodromy conditions in the physical sector. We now need to figure out if these are all independent labels or if they must be constrained by physical considerations.

For this purpose we recall that a possible modular invariant is the so called "diagonal invariant" that requires the same unitary representation labelled by the same j for both left and right movers. This may be understood as being related to the representation of the full group element Dj(g) = Dj(gL(z))Dj(g- 1R()) which requires the same j for both left and right movers. Therefore, we must demand s0  =  s̃0.

In addition, we examine g(z,) in more detail. Keeping the order of operators, it may be written in the form

[formula]

with

[formula]

We see that g is not periodic under σ  →  σ + 2πn since there are logarithms in the expressions for every X±  L,R, uL,R. However, provided we impose   p+ =  - p̃+ on physical states (to cancel the non-periodic behavior in X+L - X+R), we find that we can rewrite this monodromy in the form

[formula]

where p+,s0 are operators which do not commute with q-,u0, and similarly for right movers (note that we have never introduced a canonical conjugate to p- (or p̃-)). To insure that the matrix elements of the overall g are consistent with monodromy in the physical sector it is sufficient to impose the conditions

[formula]

where m is an integer. Since we have already seen that s0  =  s̃0 we find that this condition reduces to r -  = m, and does not impose any additional constraints on r,. Furthermore, for a closed string we should also have L0  -  0 = 0 on the physical states. According to the mass shell condition ([\ref=shell]) this requires r - l =   -  .

So, modular invariant physical closed string states are labelled at the base as follows

[formula]

where the following restrictions are imposed

[formula]

Then the on-shell physical states automatically satisfy the periodicity conditions.

Chiral Vertex operators

In string theory there is a vertex operator corresponding to every physical state. In the usual algebraic approach one would try to construct a chiral vertex operator Vjm(z) corresponding to the "tachyon" state |jm > . In our case we have diagonalized J00 + J10  →  p+ instead of J00  →  m. Hence, our vertex operator is labelled as Vjp+(z).   In this basis, we need a vertex operator with the following operator product properties

[formula]

where ta is a Hermitean generator of SL(2,R) that acts on the p+ label in the unitary principal series labelled by j =  - 1 / 2 + is. This representation is given by

[formula]

A vertex operator with these properties is given by

[formula]

It is straightforward to verify that it has the correct operator product properties with the currents in ([\ref=wzwcurrent]). This product of exponentials has a rather simple structure which can be readily manipulated in the computation of corellation functions.

There is a ln z term in the first exponential

[formula]

The monodromy condition requires that the power p+α-0  =   integer, in agreement with the previous approach.

In the construction of corellation functions in other WZW models it has been found that there are screening charges that play an important role. In the SL(2,R) case we found the following two screening currents (note that S1  ~  ∂X+)

[formula]

Their operator products with the currents are

[formula]

and

[formula]

Therefore, the zero modes of these screening currents

[formula]

are the screening charges that commute with all the currents. These play an important role in the construction of corellation functions. We hope to discuss these issue further in future work.

Comments

We have shown that a unitary string theory in SL(2,R) curved spacetime can be constructed and its spectrum solved exactly. A crucial ingredient was an additional zero mode whose presence introduces many new technical and physical features. This should provide a lesson for other more involved models.

Attention was drawn to some new technical points. The first is that currents are allowed to contain logarithmic cuts provided monodromy conditions are applied on the physical states. The second is a new representation of the currents in terms of free bosons that render the theory completely solvable. Vertex operators and screening currents that should be useful in computations were also suggested. These features have obvious generalizations to higher dimensions as well as to gauged WZW models (coset models).

We have also shown that the free boson methods permit a more general representation of SL(2,R) current algebra when the extra degrees of freedom [formula] are introduced. These were absent in the WZW model, but they may be present in more general models.

As emphasized in the introduction, the main purpose for the present exercise is to develop the appropriate methods to study string theory during the early universe and to understand the impact of string theory on the symmetries and matter content observed at accelerator energies. For this purpose the current methods must be generalized to heterotic strings such as those described in [\cite=ibhetero]. Methods used for other special models of curved spacetimes may also be helpful [\cite=others].
