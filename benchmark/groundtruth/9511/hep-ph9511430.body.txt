Introduction

The measurement of the total cross section for electron positron annihilation into hadrons allows for a unique test of pertubative QCD. The decay rate Γ(Z  →  ) provides one of the most precise determinations of the strong coupling constant αs. In the high energy limit the quark masses can often be neglected. In this approximation QCD corrections to [formula] have been calculated up to order α3s [\cite=CheKatTka79DinSap79CelGon80] [\cite=GorKatLar91SurSam91]. For precision measurements the dominant mass corrections must be included through an expansion in m2 / s. Terms up to order α3sm2 / s [\cite=CheKue90] and α2sm4 / s2 [\cite=CheKue94] are available at present, providing an acceptable approximation from the high energy region down to intermediate energy values. For a number of measurements, however, the information on the complete mass dependence is desirable. This includes charm and bottom meson production above the resonance region, say above 4.5 GeV and 12 GeV, respectively, and, of course, top quark production at a future electron positron collider.

To order αs this calculation was performed by Källén and Sabry in the context of QED a long time ago [\cite=KaeSab55]. With measurements of ever increasing precision, predictions in order α2s are needed for a reliable comparison between theory and experiment. Furthermore, when one tries to apply the O(α) result to QCD, with its running coupling constant, the choice of scale becomes important. In fact, the distinction between the two intrinsically different scales, the relative momentum versus the center of mass energy, is crucial for a stable numerical prediction. This information can be obtained from a full calculation to order α2s only. Such a calculation then allows to predict the cross section in the complete energy region where perturbative QCD can be applied -- from close to threshold up to high energies.

In this paper results for the cross section are presented in order α2s. They are obtained from the vacuum polarisation Π(q2) which is calculated up to three loops. The imaginary part of the "fermionic contribution" -- derived from diagrams with a massless quark loop inserted in the gluon propagator -- has been calculated in [\cite=HoaKueTeu95]. All integrals could be performed to the end and the result was expressed in terms of polylogarithms. In this paper the calculation is extended to the full set of diagrams relevant for QCD. Instead of trying to perform the integrals analytically, we use the large q2 behaviour of Π(q2) up to terms of order m2 / q2 and calculate its Taylor series around q2 = 0 up to terms of order q8. The leading and next-to-leading singularity is deduced from the known behaviour of the nonrelativistic Green function and the two-loop QCD potential. Altogether eight constraints on Π(q2) are thus available, four from q2 = 0, two from q2  →    -    ∞   and two from the threshold.

The contributions ~  C2F,  ~  CACF and ~  CFTnl have to be treated separately since they differ significantly in their singularity structure. For each of the three functions an interpolation is constructed which incorporates all data and is based on conformal mapping and Padé approximation suggested in [\cite=FleTar94] [\cite=BroFleTar93] [\cite=BroBaiIly94] [\cite=BaiBro95]. Since the result for CFTnl is available in closed form the approximation method can be tested and shown to give excellent result for this case. Reliable predictions for R to order α2s and arbitrary m2 / s are thus available.

In this paper only results without renormalization group improvement and resummation of the Coulomb singularities from higher orders are presented. Resummation of leading higher order terms, phenomenological applications and a more detailed discussion of our methods will be presented elsewhere.

The Calculation

A large number of ingredients are needed in the calculation of the three-loop vacuum polarisation function: The high energy behaviour of Π(q2), its Taylor series at q2 = 0 and its singularities at threshold which are related to the QCD potential. The decomposition of Π according to its colour structure and the separation of gluonic and fermionic contributions is crucial to display the striking differences in the threshold region. The approximation method is based on conformal mapping and Padé approximation. In the present approach both real and imaginary parts of the vacuum polarization Π(q2) are calculated and its analyticity properties are exploited heavily.

The physical observable R(s) is related to Π(q2) by

[formula]

It is convenient to define

[formula]

with the [formula] coupling αs(μ2) defined in the conventional way.

To describe the singularity structure of Π in the region close to threshold the perturbative QCD potential [\cite=Fis77]

[formula]

will become important. The CACF and CFTnl contributions have been displayed separately, with CF = 4 / 3, CA = 3 and T = 1 / 2. The number of fermions is denoted by Nf and has to be distinguished from the number of light ([formula] massless) fermions nl = Nf - 1. To transform the results from QED to QCD the proper group theoretical coefficients CF = 1,CA = 0 and T = 1 have to be used.

In this paper we are only concerned with contributions to Π(q2) and R(s) which originate from diagrams where the electromagnetic current couples to the massive quark. In order αs and α2s all these amplitudes are proportional to Q2f, the square of the charge of the massive quark. Diagrams where the electromagnetic current couples to a massless quark and the massive quark is produced through a virtual gluon have been calculated in [\cite=HoaKueTeu94] and will not be discussed here.

For the α2s calculation the following steps have been performed:

Decomposition according to the colour structure

The contributions from diagrams with nl light or one massive internal fermion loop will be denoted by [formula] and [formula] with the group theoretical coefficients factored out. Purely gluonic corrections are proportional to C2F or CACF. The former are the only contributions in an abelian theory, the latter are characteristic for the nonabelian aspects of QCD. It will be important in the subsequent discussion to treat these two classes separately, since they exhibit qualitatively different behaviour close to threshold. The following decomposition of Π(q2) (and similarly for R(s)) is therefore adopted throughout the paper

[formula]

All steps described below have been performed seperately for the first three contributions to Π(2). In fact, new information is only obtained for [formula] and [formula] since [formula] is known analytically already. The amplitude with a massive internal fermion exhibits a two particle cut with threshold at 2m which has been calculated analytically [\cite=HoaKueTeu95]. The contribution from a four particle cut with threshold at 4m is given in terms of a two dimensional integral [\cite=HoaKueTeu95] which can be solved easily numerically. The Π(2)F term will not be treated in this paper.

Analysis of the high q2 behaviour

The high energy behaviour of Π provides important constraints on the complete answer. In the limit of small m2 / q2 the constant term and the one proportional to m2 / q2 (modulated by powers of ln μ2 / q2) have been calculated a long time ago [\cite=GorKatLar86]. For the imaginary part even the m4 / q4 terms are available [\cite=CheKue94]. This provides an important test of the numerical results presented below.

Threshold behaviour

General arguments based on the influence of Coulomb exchange close to threshold, combined with the information on the perturbative QCD potential and the running of αs dictate the singularities and the structure of the leading cuts close to threshold, that is for small [formula]. The C2F term is directly related to the QED result with internal photon lines only. The leading 1 / v singularity and the constant term of RA can be predicted from the nonrelativistic Greens function for the Coulomb potential and the O(αs) calculation. The next-to-leading term is determined by the combination of one loop results again with the Coulomb singularities [\cite=BarGatKoeKun75] [\cite=VolSmi94] [\cite=BaiBro95]. One finds

[formula]

The contributions ~  CACF and ~  CFTnl can be treated in parallel. The leading CACF and CFTnl term in R is proportional to ln v2 and is responsible for the evolution of the coupling constant close to threshold. Also the constant term can be predicted by the observation, that the leading term in order αs is induced by the potential. The O(αs) result

[formula]

is employed to predict the logarithmic and constant CFCA and CFTnl terms of O(α2s) by replacing αs by [formula] as given in Eq.([\ref=alphav]). This implies the following threshold behaviour:

[formula]

This ansatz can be verified for the CFTnl term since in this case the result is known in analytical form [\cite=HoaKueTeu95]. Extending the ansatz from the behaviour of the imaginary part close to the branching point into the complex plane allows to predict the leading term of Π(q2) ~   ln v and ~   ln v2.

Behaviour at q2 = 0

Important information is contained in the Taylor series of Π(q2) around zero. The calculation of the first four nontrivial terms is based on the evaluation of three-loop tadpole integrals with the help of the algebraic program MATAD written in FORM [\cite=VerFORM] which performs the traces, calculates the derivatives with respect to the external momenta. It reduces the large number of different integrals to one master integral and a few simple ones through an elaborate set of recursion relations based on the integration-by-parts method [\cite=CheTka81] [\cite=Bro92]. Though this master integral, calculated in [\cite=Bro92], appears in the result for single diagrams, in the final expession it cancels. The following results are obtained (excluding the Π(2)F term):

[formula]

The C2F terms in C1, C2 and C3 are in agreement with [\cite=BaiBro95], the remaining ones are new. (Note that the CFT contribution calculated in [\cite=BaiBro95] were obtained with massive internal fermions.)

Conformal mapping and Padé approximation

The vacuum polarisation function Π(2) is analytic in the complex plane cut from q2 = 4m2 to +    ∞  . The Taylor series in q2 is thus convergent in the domain |q2| < 4m2 only. The conformal mapping which corresponds to the variable transformation

[formula]

transforms the cut complex q2 plane into the interior of the unit circle. The special points q2 = 0,4m2, -   ∞   correspond to ω = 0,1, - 1, respectively.

The upper (lower) part of the cut is mapped onto the upper (lower) perimeter of the circle. The Taylor series in ω thus converges in the interior of the unit circle. To obtain predictions for Π(q2) at the boundary it has been suggested [\cite=FleTar94] [\cite=BroFleTar93] to use the Padé approximation which converges towards Π(q2) even on the perimeter. To improve the accuracy the singular threshold behaviour and the large q2 behaviour is incorporated into simple analytical functions which are removed from Π(2) before the Padé approximation is performed. The quality of this procedure can be tested by comparing the prediction with the known result for [formula].

The logarithmic singularities at threshold and large q2 are removed by subtraction, the 1 / v singularity, which is present for the C2F terms only, by multiplication with v as suggested in [\cite=BaiBro95]. The imaginary part of the remainder which is actually approximated by the Padé method is thus smooth in the entire circle, numerically small and vanishes at ω = 1 and ω =  - 1.

Results

After performing the Padé approximation for the smooth remainder with ω as natural variable, the transformation ([\ref=omega]) is inverted and the full vacuum polarisation function reconstructed by reintroducing the threshold and high energy terms. This procedure provides real and imaginary parts of Π(2). Subsequently only the absorbtive part of Π(2) (multiplied by 12π) will be presented.
