THE SOLAR NEUTRINO PUZZLE; UPDATE

STEPHEN PARKE parke fnal.gov Department of Theoretical Physics Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory P.O. Box 500, Batavia, IL 60510, U.S.A.

Current Experimental Situation

Over the last year new results from the four solar neutrino experiments have been reported. The results for Homestake[formula], Kamiokande[formula], Gallex[formula] and SAGE[formula] are

[formula]

where the first uncertainty is statistical and second systematic. To form a combined result for gallium, the mean and statistical errors for SAGE and Gallex were combined in the standard way but a common systematic error of 6 SNU was used. Then the statistical and systematic errors are combined in quadrature for each experimental result giving

[formula]

To compare these experimental results with those from the standard solar models it is convenient to use one of the models as a reference model. I will use the 1992 solar model of Bahcall and Pinsonneault [formula] as this reference solar model where the central values of the important solar neutrino fluxes are

[formula]

It is useful to normalize all solar neutrino fluxes to this model, by defining the renormalized neutrino fluxes as

[formula]

In these normalized flux units the solar luminosity constraint is simply

[formula]

This will be used to determine pp  in terms of 7Be. Then the contribution of the ,  ~   and [formula] to the chlorine, water and gallium solar neutrino experiments is

[formula]

The coefficients in eq.([\ref=tc])-([\ref=tg0]) are determined using the assumptions that the state of the neutrinos is unaffected by the passage from the solar core to the terrestrial detectors, i.e. there is no change in the flavor, helicity or energy spectrum, and that the neutrino interaction cross sections used are corrected. The uncertainty on these cross sections is estimated to be a few per cent.

Using the luminosity constraint to eliminated the   ~   flux, the contribution to the gallium experiments can be written as

[formula]

The additional contributions from other specifies of neutrinos is less than 10% in the standard solar models [formula].

The experimental results, ([\ref=ec]), ([\ref=eh]) and ([\ref=eg]), are now used to fit the two parameters, 7Be  and 8B , of the model, eq.([\ref=tc]), ([\ref=th]) and ([\ref=tg]). The χ2  variable was calculated for the four cases; all three results together and the three ways of choosing two out of three. Since the minimum value of χ2  occurs at negative values of 7Be  for all four cases, the constraint

[formula]

was imposed [formula]. Fig. 1 shows the difference in the exclusion using only the Kamiokande and new Gallium (Gallex and SAGE combined) as compared to the previous result from Gallex (83  ~    ±    ~  21 ~ SNU). The total theoretical range for the solar models of Bahcall and Pinsonneault (1992) [formula] and Turck-Chièze & Lopes [formula] are also shown in this figure by the labelled ellipses. Fig. 2 shows the exclusion using all of the latest solar neutrino experimental results. This argument was first presented by the authors of ref. [\cite=first] and updated by the authors of ref. [\cite=update].

Bahcall [formula] has argued that by using the Kamiokande measurement to determine [formula] then the Chlorine experiment puts an upper limit on the [formula] at the 95% C.L. equal to 0.41, that is,

[formula]

Similarly, he has used the Gallium plus Kamiokande plus Luminosity constraint to show that  ~  <  ~ 0.53 at 95% C.L. that is,

[formula]

These results suggest that  ~  <  ~ . Remember however that both the 7Be and 8B neutrinos are produced from the same parent in the sun, that is, 7Be via electron and proton interactions respectively. Also the 8B neutrinos are more sensitive to changes in the solar core temperature, Tc, than the 7Be neutrinos, T18c verses T8c respectively. Therefore it is very difficult to arrange  ~  <  ~  ~  <  ~ 1 in standard solar models.

Calibration of the Gallium Experiment

From June to October 1994 the Gallex detector [formula] was exposed to a 61.9  ~    ±    ~  1.2 ~ PBq neutrino source which emits neutrinos in electron capture in 51Cr, see Fig. 3. This source was made by bombarding enriched chromium in a nuclear reactor. The initial source activity produced a flux of neutrinos at the detector which was approximately 15 times the solar neutrino flux. This collaboration used three different methods to measure the initial source strength; neutron flux capture calculation, calorimetry and by measuring the 320 keV gamma ray emitted from small samples. The average of these measurements was used to compare with the strength obtained from observing the neutrino capture in the Gallex detector of 64.1  ~    ±    ~  6.6  ~    ±    ~  3.3 ~ PBq, see Fig. 4.

The ratio of the source activity as measured by Gallex to that obtained from the other methods was

[formula]

This result validates the radiochemical methods of the Gallex experiment and since 90% of the neutrinos from the 51Cr source have an energy close to the energy of the 7Be neutrinos the Gallex experiment is fully efficient at detecting neutrinos of this energy. This is a very important milestone for solar neutrino experiments.

In the autumn of 1995 the 50Cr will be re-irradiated and the calibration will be repeated. SAGE is also performing a calibration test and counting of samples from this test will continue throughout the summer of 1995.

Improved Solar Models

The inclusion of helium and heavy element diffusion has improved the consistency of the solar models by Proffit [formula], Kovetz and Shaviv [formula] and Bahcall and Pinsonneault [formula] with helioseismology. The important parameters are the surface abundance of helium,

[formula]

and the depth of the convective zone,

[formula]

Bahcall and Pinsonneault '95 ('92) models give the surface abundance of helium at 0.247 (0.273) and the fractional depth of the convective zone as 0.712 (0.707) respectively. Clearly the inclusion of diffusion improves the consistency in these parameters.

However the flux of both 7Be and 8B neutrinos increases compared to their '92 model

[formula]

This increase in fluxes leads to an increase in the expected Chlorine and Gallium counting rates to 9.3  ±  1.3 SNU and 137  ±  8 SNU as well as an increase in the flux for the Kamiokande experiment. The effect of these increased fluxes on our comparison of theory verses experiment for the solar neutrino flux is shown in Fig. 5. Clearly these new models do not help resolve the discrepancy between the solar models and the solar neutrino experiments.

Neutrino Oscillation Solutions

The latest iso-SNU contour plots by Krastev and Petcov [formula] for the "Just So" solution is given in Fig. 6 and for the MSW solution by Hata and Langacker [formula] in Fig. 7.

Next Generation Experiments

SuperKamiokande  is 10 times larger than Kamiokande III with a fiducial volume of 22 ktons and 11,000 20" PMTs. This detector will observe about 104 solar neutrino events per year in the neutrino-electron elastic scattering mode,

[formula]

and hopes to observe distortions in the solar neutrino energy spectrum after about two years of running, see fig. 8. This mode is primarily sensitive to electron-neutrinos.

As of the time of this conference many of the PMTs had been checked and pre-assembled. The start of installation was expected in June 1995 and completion in March 1996 with physics scheduled for April 1996.

Sudbury Neutrino Observatory  consists of 1000 tons of heavy water surrounded by a light water shield. This detector will be able to observe solar neutrinos in three modes,

[formula]

where x represents e,  ~  μ or τ. The expected rates for these reactions is 103, 104 and 3  ×  103 events per year. The second of these modes will be able to measure the solar electron neutrino spectrum, see Fig. 9, whereas the last reaction will measure the total solar neutrino flux regardless of the neutrinos flavor. At the time of this conference construction of this detector was proceeding according to schedule with completion set for spring/summer 1996.

Borexino  detector consists of 100 tons of liquid scintillator with a very low threshold 0.25 MeV. Again this detector is sensitive to

[formula]

but with such a low threshold this detector will be sensitive to 7Be neutrinos. If the standard solar model fluxes is correct this detector can expect 20,000 events per year. For the MSW solution to the solar puzzle the rate will be much less. Because of the large event rate this detector will be able to see the 1 / R2 variation in the solar neutrino flux. Also this detector is very sensitive to neutrino oscillations in the "Just-so" scenario, see Fig. 10. As of May 1995 this collaboration had demonstrated that they can achieve the purity levels required to set a 0.4 MeV threshold in a 6 ton prototype.

Conclusions

The calibration of the Gallex detector is a very important milestone for the field of solar neutrinos giving us confidence in all of the radio-chemical solar neutrino experiments. With the turning on of SuperKamiokande and the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory next year and Borexino a few years later this is an exciting time for the field of solar neutrinos. We will learn whether or not the solar neutrino puzzle is new, exciting neutrino physics or some problem with our understanding of the solar interior. These experiments must resolve this issue as soon as possible.
