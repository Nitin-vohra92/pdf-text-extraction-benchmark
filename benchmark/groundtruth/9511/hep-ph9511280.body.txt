ABSTRACT

We discuss the low energy implications of gauge coupling unification at the string scale, taking into account string threshold corrections in the SU(4)  ×  O(4) model. We express sin 2θW and a3 as functions of the calculable string threshold differences and discuss simple examples of spectra which retain the successful predictions of the supersymmetric unification. Using further the low energy data and reasonable values of the common gauge coupling at the string scale, we obtain the range of the threshold corrections. Finally, we study the top Yukawa coupling (ht) evolution whose initial value is determined in terms of the common gauge coupling at the string scale. We find that ht reaches its (quasi) infra-red fixed point at the weak scale and discuss the implications on the top mass.

Introduction

Recent experimental evidence indicates that the desired unification of all fundamental forces can take place (within a single gauge group) at a scale MG  ~  1016GeV, where all the couplings attain a common value, provided supersymmetry exists above a scale of the order ~  1TeV. Within the context of supersymmetry however, the origin and magnitude of Yukawa couplings and other parameters are not explained. Among the present candidates, string theories can in principle give answers to the above questions. In most of the string derived models however, this simple unification scenario based on a single non - Abelian gauge group is lost. String unification has been shown to occur at a scale some 20 times larger than the MG scale predicted by the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM).

[formula]

In the above, gstr is the universal string coupling which is fixed by the vacuum expectation value of the dilaton field S, g2str  =  2 / (S  +  S̄).

The gauge symmetry of the resulting theory below Mstr is usually a product of groups [formula] rather than a single gauge group. The corresponding field theory describing the low energy phenomena is achieved by integrating out the massive string states. As a result, the evolution of the gauge couplings gα of the effective theory should take into account threshold corrections Δα due to the infinite tower of the massive string modes. Thus, they are given by

[formula]

where bα is the beta-function and kα characterizes the Kac-Moody level of the corresponding coupling gα (kα = 1 in what follows).

As it is obvious from the above formula, string thresholds affect decisively the boundary conditions of the effective field theory gauge couplings. Therefore, the low energy predictions of a particular string model are also sensitive on Δα.

String threshold corrections have been extensively studied in the literature [\cite=ST1] [\cite=ST2]. Recently there was a revived interest from the point of view of the effective field theory[\cite=ST3] and their implications in the low energy phenomenology[\cite=ST4] [\cite=ST5].

A class of string derived models[\cite=aehn] [\cite=alr] [\cite=af] [\cite=xxG] [\cite=bf], which offer a suitable ground to study the low energy implications of these thresholds, is based on the free fermionic formulation of the four dimensional superstring[\cite=mb]. In the present work, we examine some related aspects of the string derived SU(4)  ×  O(4) model. We explore the possibility of reconciling the low energy data with the existence of the string unification point being twenty times larger that the conventional unification scale. We take into account the string threshold corrections and determine the low energy gauge couplings in terms of their differences and the spectrum of the model. We extend previous analysis on the top mass calculations and include the effects of the theory above the "GUT" scale including the string threshold corrections.

The Model

We briefly start with the basic features of the minimal supersymmetric version of the SU(4)  ×  O(4)  ~  SU(4)  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R model. The field content is summarized in the following table

[formula]

Left and right handed fermions (including the right handed neutrinos) are accommodated in the (4,2,1), (,1,2) representations respectively. Both pieces form up the complete 16th representation of SO(10). The SU(4)  ×  SU(2)R  →  SU(3)  ×  U(1) symmetry breaking is realized at a scale ~  1015 - 16GeV, with the introduction of a higgs pair belonging to H  +    =  (4,1,2)  +  (,1,2) representations. The symmetry breaking of the standard model occurs in the presence of the two standard doublet higgses which are found in the (1,2,2) representation of the original symmetry of the model. (The decomposition of the latter under the SU(3)  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y gauge group results to the two higgs doublets [formula].) The three singlets φm's are engaged in the see-saw type mechanism providing MG-order masses to right handed neutrinos, while φ0 is responsible for the appearance of the Higgs mixing term. Finally, note the existence of the 'exotic' representations [formula] and aL. Although they do not arise in the 'ordinary' decomposition of an SO(10) GUT symmetry, they do appear in string derived models constructed at the level k = 1 of the Kac-Moody algebra. These states possess fractional electric charges[\cite=alr] and are expected to transform non - trivially under a hidden gauge group[\cite=gl] which becomes strong at an intermediate scale confining them into bound states. In our present analysis we are not going to discuss such complications.

The trilinear superpotential is

[formula]

The phenomenological implications of ([\ref=sp]) have been discussed elsewhere[\cite=alt] [\cite=steve] [\cite=ak]. Here we will concentrate on the renormalisation of the gauge and Yukawa couplings from the string scale to low energies. From the spectrum in ([\ref=spec]) we observe first that in the minimal case there is an excess of right doublet over left doublet fields. In fact the asymmetric form of the higgs fourplets with respect to the two SU(2) symmetries of the model, causes a different running for the gL,R gauge couplings from the string scale down to MG. The possible existence of a new pair of fourplets with SU(2)L - transformation properties (as suggested in ref.[\cite=steve]), namely HL = (4,2,1) and [formula], could adjust their running so as to have gL  =  gR at MG. This case corresponds to family - antifamily representations which can become massive close to MG, with a trilinear or higher order term of the form <  Φ > (,2,1)(4,2,1). Moreover, a relatively large number (nD) of sextet fields (nD  ~  7) remaining in the massless spectrum down to MG, would also result to an approximate equality of the above with g4 coupling. Other cases of string spectra with the desired properties are also possible.

Obviously, the equality of the three gauge couplings g4,L,R at the SU(4) breaking scale MG, is of great importance. In practice, this means that the three standard gauge couplings g1,2,3 start running from MG down to low energies, with the same initial condition. The only possible splitting would arise only from string and GUT threshold corrections[\cite=alt]. Thus, choosing MG  ~  1016GeV, we are able to obtain the correct predictions for sin 2θW and a3(mZ). As a matter of fact, the intermediate gauge breaking step gives us one more free parameter (namely MG). Having obtained the desired string spectrum, we are free to choose its value in order to reconcile the high string scale Mstr with the low energy data. Examples of string models with such properties have been proposed[\cite=gl].

The renormalisation group equations of the string version have been derived and studied in previous works[\cite=alt] [\cite=blo] [\cite=hom]. At the one loop level, taking into account the string threshold corrections we can obtain the following equations

[formula]

In the above, we have denoted [formula], with s,c the sin  and cos  of the weak mixing angle, while [formula] takes into account all possible intermediate scales. The weak mixing angle is given

[formula]

with

[formula]

If we assume the minimal supersymmetric spectrum bellow MG, where only the supersymmetry breaking scale MS enters, we can eliminate MS and determine the scale MG in terms of α3, α, sin 2θW and the differences of the string thresholds. Equivalently, sin 2θW can be expressed as follows

[formula]

where ΔL4  =  ΔL  -  Δ4, [formula] and the superscript 0 in the beta functions refers to the non-supersymmetric ones. In particular, if the beta functions b4,bL,bR above the GUT scale are equal, then b4L = b4R  =  0 and the above expression for sin 2θW becomes very simple. In this case the g4,L,R gauge coupling splittings at MG are determined only in terms of the differences Δij.

Before we proceed to the calculations, let us describe briefly the spectrum in two main energy regions. In the Mstr  -  MG region, in addition to the three generations of (4,2,1) and (,1,2), we choose the following content:

[formula]

The above content has the property of giving b4 = bL = bR = 7 (note the existence of the HL's that were mentioned before). Therefore, in the Mstr  -  MG region the three gauge couplings α4,αL,αR run in parallel, their initial points at the Mstr scale differing only due to the string threshold corrections ΔL,ΔR,Δ4. In the MG  -  MZ region, the SU(4)  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R model breaks down, at MG, to the MSSM, which at the scale MS turns to the non-supersymmetric standard model SM.

The procedure we are adopting is as follows: Using as input parameters the Mstr scale and the string threshold differences ΔL4  =  ΔL  -  Δ4, ΔR4  =  ΔR  -  Δ4, we determine MG in order to have acceptable low energy parameters sin 2θW and α3 (we fix α = 1 / 127.9). As an example, we used the Δij  =  Δi  -  Δj values obtained in ref[\cite=ST4] for the specific SU(4)  ×  O(4) model[\cite=alr]. In particular we take ΔL4  ~  8.47 and ΔR4  ~  2.05. We can then run the gauge couplings from down to up and evaluate the quantities

[formula]

The relation between Mstr and αstr can be used now to determine the absolute values of the string thresholds.

Let us now put our results into Figures. In Fig.1 we show the absolute values of the three string thresholds as a function of sin 2θW for Mstr = 0.4  ×  1018GeV and MS = 200GeV. We see a weak dependence on sin 2θW. In Fig.2 we plot the threshold ΔL as a function of both sin 2θW and Mstr. The dependence on the latter is strong. In fact, a change of Mstr from 0.3  ×  1018GeV to 0.5  ×  1018GeV results a change in ΔL from ~   - 200 to ~  100 (in Fig.1, we have chosen the value of Mstr which corresponds to Δi's of the same order as their differences). In other words, even large threshold corrections demand only a small change in the value of Mstr. If Mstr is "pushed" towards MG, then large negative threshold corrections are required. For completeness, in Fig.3 we plot contours of constant MG in the plane of (sin2θW,a3), for MS = 200GeV and Mstr = 0.4  ×  1018GeV. The line that crosses these contours gives the acceptable pairs of (sin2θW,a3) that correspond to the chosen values of Mstr and MS (as we have mentioned before we keep α = 1 / 127.9).

Top Yukawa coupling fixed point

In the case of the minimal supersymmetric standard model, it is well known that the top-Yukawa coupling evolution from the unification scale down to the low energies, exhibits a quasi-fixed point structure . In fact, starting at the GUT-scale with ht,G  >  1 the top mass is almost insensitive to the ht,G value.

Large ht,G values are in perfect agreement with the recent experimental evidence for a top mass of the O(170 - 180)GeV. Moreover, the idea of the SU(2)  ×  U(1) symmetry breaking by radiative corrections in supersymmetric theories is realized by large negative top-Yukawa corrections to the Higgs mass, which need a sufficiently large top coupling. The MSSM theory with the unification assumption of the three gauge couplings at the scale ~  1016GeV does not provide a convincing reason why the initial value of the Yukawa coupling is large. It thus appears that the infra-red structure of the top coupling has its origin in a fundamental theory beyond the MSSM. An interesting possibility is that there is additional structure above the supersymmetric 'unification' at MG  ~  1016GeV which determines Yukawas and other parameters at MG. The present string derived model provides such an example. The top Yukawa coupling is related to the gauge coupling at the string scale Mstr. The SU(4)-breaking takes place at the intermediate scale MG  ~  1016GeV, which effectively corresponds to the SUSY 'unification' scale. Knowing the evolution equations of the gauge and Yukawas between (Mstr - MG), it is rather easy to determine the ht value at the GUT scale, which will serve as initial condition for the (MG - MZ) running. In particular, if the spectrum bellow the GUT SU(4) breaking scale is that of the minimal supersymmetric standard model, then one can make a definite prediction about the top mass.

In the present model, all charged fermions of the third generation receive masses from the superpotential term λ1Fh. Therefore the SO(10) Yukawa unification condition [formula] is also retained in the SU(4)  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R symmetry. In the range Mstr  -  MG the evolution of the Yukawa coupling λ1 is given by

[formula]

where t = log(Q) is the logarithm of the scale, and the index α refers to the three gauge group factors α  =  4,L,R in the range Q  =  (Mstr  -  MG). For the sake of simplicity, in the above differential equation we have ignored terms proportional to the other Yukawa couplings of the superpotential. If all couplings were included, only a numerical solution would be possible[\cite=wip], however our results concerning the top-mass prediction would not be essentially affected. The coefficients cα are given by

[formula]

Thus, in the range Mstr - MG the solution for λ1 is given by the following expression

[formula]

with

[formula]

At the SU(4) breaking scale MG the original symmetry breaks down to the standard gauge group. As pointed out previously the top Yukawa coupling has the same initial value at MG with the b - τ's, i.e., we are in the case of tan β  ≫  1. In the case of the large tanβ, ignoring the τ - Yukawa, for equal ht,hb couplings we can obtain the following expression[\cite=FLL] for the top-Yukawa evolution below MG

[formula]

where the relation [formula] has been taken into account. The expressions γQ(t),IQ(t) are similar to those of γU,IU in ([\ref=IU]) respectively. Therefore, combining the above two equations, we determine the top Yukawa coupling and its mass at low energies directly from the initial value of the coupling λ1 at Mstr. In particular, imposing the initial condition [formula] predicted in this particular model, we obtain the following formula for the top mass

[formula]

with υ  =  246GeV.

Finally, in Table I we present the (physical) top mass predictions and the range of tan β in order to have the running bottom mass mb(mb) = (4.15 - 4.35)GeV, for three representative cases of the supersymmetry breaking scale MS. We also show, for each case, the corresponding "GUT" scale MG and α3(MZ). The string scale value is Mstr = 0.4  ×  1018GeV ( which gives gstr = 0.77) and sin 2θW = .232. We have checked that the effect of string thresholds on mt is of the order of (4 - 6)%. Thus for given mb and sin 2θW (or α3) values, mphyst is well determined in terms of the infrared fixed property of the Yukawa coupling.

Mstr = 0.4  ×  1018GeV,  gstr = 0.77,   sin 2θW = .232

[formula]

Note that in our actual calculations we have taken into account the MS scale, thus running the (non supersymmetric) SM beta-fubctions for gauge as well as Yukawa couplings. At the MS scale, the initial conditions for the ht and hb running are of course hNSt(tG) = ht(tG)sinβ and hNSb(tG) = hb(tG)cosβ. We have also checked that, running (numerically) the coupled differential equations for ht and hb on the one hand and using the equations ([\ref=laB] -[\ref=Ytb]) on the other, the differences between these procedures are negligible. Note that the RGEs for ht and hb in the range MG - MS differ only in the small U(1)-gauge coefficient.

Conclusions

In the present work we have analysed the possibility to obtain low energy predictions compatible with the experimental data in string derived models with SU(4)  ×  O(4) symmetry. Generally, large string thresholds are required to reconcile the experimental data with the existence of the large gap between the string (Mstr  ~  5  ×  1017GeV) and supersymmetric (MG  ~  1.5  ×  1016GeV) unification scales. It is argued here that, a simple and viable scenario - compatible with the low energy phenomenological expectations - is to obtain a massless spectrum which allows approximatelly a parallel evolution of the gauge couplings between Mstr  -  MG. Given the rich spectrum of such models[\cite=aehn] [\cite=alr] [\cite=af], one could choose carefully the vacuum expectation values of the singlet fields associated with the large breaking scale of the possible surplus U(1) symmetries and make massive those states which allow equal beta function coefficients in most of the range above MG. This would simply correspond to a judicious choice of a specific flat direction of the effective field theory superpotential.

In the above context, we have considered the evolution of the top Yukawa coupling from the string scale down to low energies. We have found that it exhibits a fixed point structure thus leading to definite predictions for the top mass compatible with its present experimentally determined range.
