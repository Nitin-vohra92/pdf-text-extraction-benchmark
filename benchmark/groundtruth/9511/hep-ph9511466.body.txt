Supersymmetry is perhaps the most popular and promising theoretical concept going beyond the Standard Model (SM). The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) [\cite=mssm] is obtained from the SM by the naive supersymmetrization of both the particle content and the couplings in the latter. However, the most general Lagrangian consistent with supersymmetry as well as with the [formula] gauge symmetry contains terms that have no analogue within the SM. This comes about as one of the Higgs supermultiplets has the same quantum numbers as the doublet lepton superfields and thus may be replaced by the latter in the Lagrangian. A similar effect may also be spontaneously generated if any of the sneutrino fields develops a vacuum expectation value. Furthermore, trilinear terms involving the singlet quark superfields are also allowed. The additional pieces in the superpotential may thus be parametrized as [\cite=rpar]

[formula]

where Eci,Uci,Dci are the singlet superfields and Li and Qi are the SU(2)-doublet lepton and quark superfields. The coefficients λ''ijk are antisymmetric under the interchange of the last two indices, while λijk are antisymmetric under the interchange of the first two.

Terms as in eq.([\ref=R-parity]) obviously have striking phenomenological consequences. For example, the λijk and λ'ijk couplings violate lepton number, while the λ''ijk violate baryon number. Simultaneous presence of both may therefore lead to catastrophically high rates for proton decay. In a similar vein, pairs of such couplings may induce tree-level flavour-changing neutral currents. Such considerations led to the introduction of a discrete symmetry known as "R-parity". Expressible in terms of baryon number (B), lepton number (L) and the intrinsic spin (S), [formula] has a value of + 1 for all SM particles and - 1 for all their superpartners. Apart from ruling out each of the terms in eq.([\ref=R-parity]), an exact R-parity has the additional consequence of rendering the lightest superpartner (LSP) stable.

While this discrete symmetry may be phenomenologically desirable, there is no clear theoretical motivation for it to exist. Even phenomenologically, an exact R-parity is an overkill. The constraints from proton-decay may be evaded by assuming that all of the λ''ijk vanish identically. Such an assumption is well motivated within certain theoretical scenarios [\cite=hall-suzuki] and we shall hold it to be true. The problem of preservation of GUT-scale baryogenesis [\cite=baryo] is thus rendered largely ineffectual. The presence of the other [formula]  terms can, however, also affect the baryon asymmetry of the universe. It has been argued [\cite=dreiner], though, that such bounds are highly model-dependent and can hence be evaded, for example by conserving one lepton flavour over cosmological time scales.

Couplings as in eq.([\ref=R-parity]) can also be bounded by using various low-energy data such as lepton- or meson-decays [\cite=barger] [\cite=d_tau], or from analyses of the Z-decay modes at LEP [\cite=z-decay]. Many of these constraints are relatively weak though, and the allowed magnitudes for the corresponding couplings may lead to remarkable signals at LEP2 [\cite=grt] [\cite=bkp] [\cite=lep2]. Most of such studies concentrate on scenarios wherein the LSP and/or other supersymmetric particles are light enough to be produced at LEP2. The breaking of R-parity then leads to certain tell-tale signatures.

In this Letter, we investigate the orthogonal set, namely we assume that none of the supersymmetric particles (including the LSP) can be produced with a significant cross-section. The suppression could come from two sources : (i) all supersymmetric particles are relatively heavy, or (ii) the lighter ones couple very weakly to the relevant SM particles. Any possible effect can then only be virtual. The best testing ground at LEP2 is provided by pair-production of light charged fermions :

[formula]

For experimental reasons, we confine ourselves to f  =  e,μ,τ,b,c, and hence to the couplings λ12k,13k,231 and λ'113,12k. The SM contribution to the above process is in the form of γ,Z mediated s-channel diagrams (for f  =  e, additional t-channel ones too). The introduction of the terms in eq.([\ref=R-parity]) leads to new t-channel (also s-channel for f  =  e) diagrams governed by the following Yukawa couplings :

[formula]

For f  =  e,μ,τ we then have sneutrino-mediated diagrams, while for f  =  b,c we have ũjL- and d̃jR exchanges respectively. At this stage it is useful to note that if we close our eyes to the global quantum numbers for the scalars, the squark interaction mimics that of certain scalar leptoquarks while the sneutrinos mimic a dilepton. Thus much of the analysis presented here can trivially be extended to a discussion of leptoquark and dilepton couplings.

Since the [formula] interactions have a structure different from the SM one, the angular distribution for the f pair is a sensitive probe for the existence of the former. In fact, this very difference alters the mass-dependence of these bounds from the linear relation derived from low-energy measurements. The sensitivity of the experiment can be gauged by dividing the angular width of the experiment into bins and comparing the observed number of events nj in each with the SM prediction nSMj. A quantitative measure is given by a χ2 test:

[formula]

The number of events is obtained by integrating the differential distribution over the angular bin and is given by

[formula]

where ε is the detector efficiency and L is the machine luminosity. The error in eq.([\ref=chi2]) is obtained by adding the statistical and systematic ones in quadrature :

[formula]

To be quantitative, we shall use

[formula]

For experimental convenience, we demand that the outgoing leptons or jets in eq.([\ref=pair-prodn]) be at least [formula] away from the beam pipe. Within this restricted region we assume uniform detection efficiencies [\cite=tariq]

[formula]

Dividing the above-mentioned angular region (between [formula] and [formula]) into 20 equal-sized bins, we then perform the χ2 test as in eq.([\ref=chi2]). To avoid spurious contributions to the χ2 we reject a bin from the analysis if either (i) the difference between the SM expectation and the measured number of events is less than 1 or (ii) the SM expectation is less than 1 event while the measured number is less than 3.

We present our results in the form of 95% C.L. bounds in the two-parameter space of the sfermion mass and the [formula] coupling. The interpretation is straightforward. Any combination of the two parameters above the curves (i.e. away from the origin) can be ruled out at 95% C.L.. As we are dealing with one-sided bounds, this corresponds to χ2  >  4.61 in eq.([\ref=chi2]) [\cite=pdg].

Figure (1a) shows the bounds for all the relevant λ's as a function of the squark-mass. Since both λ'121 and λ'121 are probed by the angular distribution of charm jets, the sensitivity is identical. The constraints on λ'123 is somewhat stronger as both the c and the b quarks are observable in the final state. A curious point is that inspite of lower detector efficiency, c-jet distributions are more sensitive to the presence of [formula] couplings than the b-jets. This can be traced to the relative size of the interference term. The bounds on λ'121 and λ'123 are significantly stronger than those available today [\cite=barger] [\cite=d_tau]. Though the direct experimental bounds on λ'122 and λ'133 as weak, these induce radiative correction to the Majorana mass for the electron neutrino [\cite=mohap] [\cite=grt] [\cite=d_tau] and thus can be restricted severely. On the other hand, λ'113 is tightly bound from charged current universality [\cite=barger].

Figure (1b) shows similar bounds for the λs as a function of the sneutrino mass. While λ122 or λ132 lead to a t-channel sneutrino (μL and μL respectively) diagram for e+e-  →  μ+μ-, λ123 or λ133 do the same for τ-production. Since the detector efficiencies for μ-pair and τ-pair are quite similar, the corresponding bounds are almost indistuingishable from each other. Though λ231 leads to additional diagrams in both the μ- and τ-channels, the sensitivity. This again can be traced back to the size of the interference term (since this coupling sees eR rather than eL). The most interesting cases are however those of λ121 and λ131. Apart from muonic (tauonic) final states, these couplings contribute to e+e-  →  e+e- as well. The dip in the contour corresponds to a resonance production of a sneutrino which subsequently decays into a e+e- pair. As in the λ' case, here too non-observation of a Majorana mass for the νe constrains λ122,133. Of the rest, these new bounds on λ131,132 would be the strongest yet. The others are at best similar to the present ones. Only in the case of the sneutrinos being considerably lighter than the corresponding charged sleptons, will there be a qualitative improvement.

To conclude, we point out that the present constraints on some of the [formula] couplings are relatively weak. If the supersymmetric particles are light enough to be produced copiously at LEP2, we would shortly be in a position to witness dramatic signals. On the other hand, if they are either too heavy or too weakly coupled to be produced, indirect effects provide us with a means to investigate this sector. We exhibit that quite a few of the lepton-number violating [formula]  couplings lead to significant deviations in the e+e-  →  f angular distributions. For some of the couplings, this effect can be used to impose bounds that are stronger than any available today, while for others it will provide a complementary test. A similar analysis would also be applicable to a large class of leptoquark and dilepton couplings.
