An application of Jacquet-Langlands correspondence to transfer operators for geodesic flows on Riemann surfaces

Transfer operator for cofinite Fuchsian groups and Selberg's zeta function

Theorem Theorem Theorem Theorem Theorem Theorem Theorem Theorem Theorem     In this section we give a short summary of the generalization of Mayer's theory [\cite=mayer91] by following Morita [\cite=morita97]. In Mayer's theory a transfer operator Ls is introduced as a special case of Ruelle's operator for a dynamical system, for instance for the group [formula] this is the twice iterated Gauss map T = T2G acting on the unit interval and the weight function -  β log |T'(z)|. Then, as a result of the one-to-one correspondence between the closed geodesics on the modular surface [formula] and the primitive periodic orbits of T the Selberg zeta function can be written as a Fredholm determinant of the transfer operator [\cite=mayer92].

Morita in[\cite=morita97] takes instead of [formula] and the Poincare half plane H the isomorphic group PSU(1,1) and as homogeneous space the unit disc [formula] which is isomorphic to H. Let Γ be a cofinite Fuchsian group. The canonical fundamental domain of Γ is a polygon with a finite even number of sides si, each of which extends to a circular arc C(si) perpendicular to the unit circle S1, the boundary of [formula]. To every side si a generator g(si) is assigned which identifies the sides mutually. Now the action of the generators on the boundary points S1 defines a Markov map [\cite=bowen]

[formula]

where one chooses for each x the corresponding gi according to the location of x between the footpoints of C(si)'s on S1 as explained in [\cite=morita97].

By letting the group Γ act on sides si and taking from them the arcs passing through vertexes of the fundamental polygon which cut the boundary, S1 is partitioned into a set of intervals [formula]. Like for the modular group and the Gauss map with the corresponding partition [\cite=mayer_book], the map TΓ with respect to the partition P' satisfies the properties of orbit equivalence, piecewise monotonicity, the Markov property and transitivity. As in [\cite=morita97] by using the intervals in P' it can be constructed a finite partition [formula] and its refinement [formula] finite or infinite, such that the union of each of them differs from the other up to a set of zero Lebesgue measure. Furthermore to each J∈P there is a homomorphism TJ from J onto A∈R. Finally a map T is defined approximately everywhere on [formula] such that T|intJ = TJ|intJ. As in [\cite=morita97] we call the set of partitions R and P together with the map T a Markov system TΓ = (R,P,T).

As in [\cite=morita97] we set

[formula]

then the transfer operator is defined as

[formula]

on direct sum of q = card R Banach spaces chosen in such way that([\ref=transfer_op.]) defines a nuclear operator where for J∈P, ι(J) denotes the index with int J  ⊂  int A(ι(J)) and τ(J) denotes the index with TJJ = A(τ(J)). See the Convention 2.6 of [\cite=morita97]. Like the case of [formula] regarding the correspondence between the closed geodesics on the fundamental surface of the group and the periodic orbit of T we achieve a determinant expression for the corresponding Selberg zeta function. We summarize the final result as the following theorem of Morita [\cite=morita97]. We recall some notations and definitions we used in Theorm 1. According to Selberg for Res > 1 the Selberg zeta function is given by absolutely convergent infinite product similar to Euler products of zeta function from number theory

[formula]

where P runs through all primitive hyperbolic conjugacy classes HC(Γ) with a norm N(P) > 1. P primitive plays the role of prime number or prime ideal. Using his trace formula Selberg proved that (1) ZΓ(s) has analytic(meromorphic) continuation to the whole [formula] (2) ZΓ(s) satisfies the functional equation

[formula]

with known function Ψ (3) the nontrivial zeros of ZΓ(s) are related to eigenvalues and resonances of automorphic Laplacian for the group A(Γ) [\cite=selberg], see also [\cite=alexei].

There is another equivalent definition of the Selberg zeta function related to dynamical system of a geodesic flow on Riemann surface with constant negative curvature. This definition is important for theorem 1 above:

[formula]

In formula above we use c instead of P like in [\cite=morita97]. Recall that an element c of PSU(1,1) is hyperbolic if it has only two fixed point on the boundary S1. c is a primitive element of Γ if it is not a power of other elements in Γ. Let [formula] are fixed points of c. This defines the geodesic line connecting w1, w2. The projection of this geodesic to the quotient space [formula] is closed geodesic and l(c) is the hyperbolic length of corresponding prime closed geodesic. We have

[formula]

Jacquet-Langlands correspondence

In [\cite=hejhal] an explicit integral operator lift with Siegel theta function as the kernel, between Maass forms of unit group of an indefinite quaternion division algebra and congruence subgroups of the modular group is constructed. This is indeed an especial case of Jacquet-Langlands correspondence which Hejhal reproved by using classical argument [\cite=hejhal]. To introduce this correspondence we follow [\cite=hejhal], [\cite=bolte1] and [\cite=bolte]. We start by recalling the unit group of quaternion algebra.

Unit group of quaternion algebra

In this part we follow [\cite=miyake]. We call a ring B with unity an algebra of dimension n over a field F, if the following three conditions are satisfied:

(1) F  ⊂  B, and the unity of F coincides with the unity of B;

(2) all elements of F commute with all element of B;

(3) B is a vector space over F of dimension n. Let B be an algebra over F. The center of B is defined as the set of all commuting element of the algebra and is denoted by Z(B). We call B a central algebra when Z(B) = F. The algebra B is called simple if it is simple as a ring, namely, if B has no two-sided ideals except for [formula] and B itself. We call B a division algebra if every nonzero element of B is invertable. Now we can give the definition of quaternion algebra.A central simple algebra B of dimension 4 over a field F is called a quaternion algebra over F. Furthermore, if B is a division algebra, we call B a division quaternion algebra. Let B be a quaternion algebra over a field F. As a result of Wedderburn's theorem there are only two possibilities [\cite=lewis]

(1) B is a division quaternion algebra

(2) B splits over F that is, B is isomorphic to M2(F)

Using the following results [\cite=weil] one can define a norm for B. 1)If F is algebraically closed, then M2(F) is a unique quaternion algebra over F up to isomorphism. 2) Let K be any extension over F. Then [formula] is a quaternion algebra over K. We say that B is ramified or splits over K if [formula] is a division quaternion algebra or is isomorphic to M2(K), respectively. Now for the quaternion algebra B over F let [formula] be the algebraic closure of F. According to the results above [formula] is a quaternion algebra over the algebraically closed field [formula] and therefore [formula] is isomorphic to [formula]. Now we can define (reduced) norm and (reduced) trace for elements of B by

[formula]

where det(β) and tr(β) are determinant and trace of β as an element of [formula]. In [\cite=weil] it is proved that both NB(β) and trB(β) belong to F.

For an algebra B not necessarily of quaternion type over the field of rational numbers [formula] or its p-adic extensions [formula] the concept of an order is defined as a subset R of B if the following two conditions are satisfied: (1) R is a subring containing the unity of B (2) R is finitely generated over [formula] or [formula] and contains a basis of B over F.An order of B is called maximal if it is maximal with respect to inclusion. Conjugate orders are characterized by a number called discriminant. The discriminant d(R) of an order R of an algebra B is defined to be the square of the product of primes p where B is ramified over [formula] that is [formula] is division quaternion algebra. All orders with same discriminant are conjugate.Let B be a quaternion algebra over [formula]. We call B indefinite or definite according as [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] or is a division quaternion algebra. Let B be an indefinite quaternion algebra over [formula]. We fix an isomorphism of [formula] onto [formula] and consider B as an subalgebra of [formula] through this isomorphism. Then the norm NB(β) of an element β of B is nothing but the determinant of β as a matrix, by definition. Let R be an order of B. We put

[formula]

and call it the unit group of norm 1 of R. Because of this theorem from now on we restrict ourself to an order O of an indefinite quaternion algebra over the field of rational numbers [formula] and its unit group O1. By definition we can fix an emmbeding

[formula]

Furthermore according to definition we have

[formula]

where e1, e2, e3 and e4 form a basis for B over [formula].

For this representation of the order O as a four dimensional vector space over [formula] the norm is defined as a quadratic form which realized as a 4  ×  4 symmetric matrix with respect to the basis of the indefinite quaternion algebra B:

[formula]

where *   denotes the algebra product.

Siegel theta function

In this part we introduce the Siegel theta function by following [\cite=hejhal], [\cite=bolte1], and [\cite=bolte]. For a symmetric matrix [formula] the majorant P is defined to be a positive definite matrix such that PS- 1P = S. We fix S to be

[formula]

It is easy to see that identity matrix is one of the majorants of S. For [formula] and [formula] such that

[formula]

we define [formula] by

[formula]

where

[formula]

As in [\cite=hejhal] one can see that A(L1,L2)tA(L1,L2) is a majorant of S. For w and z belonging to H where z = x + iy we define

[formula]

Let O be an order in an indefinite quaternion algebra over [formula]. Then let S' be the matrix of the norm of O with respect to a fixed basis of the algebra. For q∈O let kq∈Z4 be the corresponding element in [formula] in this basis (see formula ([\ref=vector_rep.]) from above subsection).

We fix an embedding [formula]. Since σ is linear, we have a unique [formula] which for every q satisfies

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we conclude that S' = BtSB. For this fixed embedding of O, we define majorants Pzw' of S' by Pzw': = BtPzwB. Now fix z0∈H and let τ = u + iv, z = x + iy∈H. With R: = uS' + ivPzz0', we define a Siegel theta function θ(z;τ) by

[formula]

The Siegel theta function has the following transformation property which is crucial for the application in the next subsection. We give it as a theorem whose proof one can find in [\cite=bolte1]

Theta-lifts

In this subsection we introduce two integral transformations providing us a lift between Maass forms of unit group and congruence subgroup. As before, let O be an order with discriminant d(O) in an indefinite quaternion division algebra over [formula] and O1 denotes the corresponding unit group. In [\cite=bolte1] by choosing a suitable referencee point z0 appearing in the definition of Siegel theta function we have the following result which we give as a theorem. In [\cite=bolte1] it is proved that for a basis [formula] of eigenfunctions of Laplacian on XO, Θ(φk) is not identically zero for all k. Thus we have the following theorem whose proof one can see in [\cite=bolte1] In [\cite=bolte] equality of the right hand sides of Selberg's trace formula for O1 and Selberg's trace formula for new forms of congruence subgroups which are defined in the next section, is shown. In this way one gets the following identity

[formula]

This together with the last theorem leads to

Selberg trace formula

In this section we introduce shortly the Selberg trace formula for the general case of a cofinite group together with the special cases of congruence subgroups and unit group of quaternion algebra. Then we define the Selberg trace formula for new forms.

The trace formula is a general identity connecting geometrical and spectral terms

[formula]

In the Selberg trace formula the spectral terms come from the discrete and the continuous spectrum of automorphic hyperbolic Laplacian A(Γ) for a cofinite group Γ and the geometrical terms are integral operators depending on the conjugacy classes of Γ. As in [\cite=alexei] one can calculate the integrals explicitly and achieve the final form of the Selberg trace formula. We give it in the form of a theorem as in [\cite=koyama]

In the case of cocompact groups including the unit group of quaternion algebras there is no continuous spectrum and no parabolic element, thus the trace formula ([\ref=trace_formula]) reduces to

[formula]

Consider a congruence subgroup [formula]. As in [\cite=bolte] the space Cn(λ) of Maass forms with eigenvalue λ, can be decomposed into two subspaces of new and old forms [formula]. The space Coldn(λ) is the linear span of all forms with the same eigenvalue λ coming from all overgroups Γ0(m)  ⊃  Γ0(n) with m|n and Cnewn(λ) is defined to be the orthogonal complement of Coldn(λ). Let us denote the dimension of Cn(λ) and Cnewn(λ) by δ(n,λ) and δnew(n,λ) respectively. Then the following identity holds [\cite=atkin]

[formula]

with

[formula]

where μ(a) is the Moebius function. Identity ([\ref=dim-formula]) leads to the following formula [\cite=bolte]

[formula]

This suggest us to take the sum

[formula]

for defining the left hand side of Selberg trace formula for new forms. Note, that under certain condition for d, as has been explained in [\cite=bolte], the sum [formula] is equal to one and therefore

[formula]

Thus we achieve the following trace formula for new forms

[formula]

The terms Inew(s), Hnew(s), Enew(s) and CPnew(s) are given by

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where Im(s), Hm(s), Em(s) and Pm(s) denotes the identity, hyperbolic, elliptic and parabolic conjugacy classes for the corresponding group Γ0(m). The term Cm(s) refers to the contribution of the continuous spectrum for the corresponding group Γ0(m). Now we give the following theorem which is proved in [\cite=bolte].

Selberg zeta function and its determinant expression

In this section we define Selberg zeta function for new forms and using the result of previous section we show that it is equal to Selberg zeta function of unit group of quaternion O1. As in [\cite=koyama] we define the Selberg zeta function as the logaritmic derivitive of the hyperbolic contribution of the right hand side of Selberg trace formula, that is

[formula]

Now by formula ([\ref=f35]) we can define the Selberg-new zeta function as

[formula]

By simple calculation the later leads to the following formula

[formula]

where Zm(s) denotes the Selberg zeta function for congruence subgroup Γ0(m). On the other hand theorem (8) together with ([\ref=Selberg_zeta]) leads to

[formula]

Let summerise our first result as a theorem Finally we can connect transfer operators for different groups through their Fredholm determinants and this is our second result in this paper. The detailed proof we publish later.

The right hand side of ([\ref=final]) can be represented in a different form. That is

[formula]

Here the operator LΓ0(m)s was introduced and studied by Mayer (see for example [\cite=chang]). The operator acts on a certain Banach space of vector valued functions [formula], where Ω is a domain in [formula] and μ is the index of Γ0(m) in [formula].
