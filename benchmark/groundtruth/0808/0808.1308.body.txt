Local structural origins of the distinct electronic properties of Nb-substituted SrTiO3 and BaTiO3

Small substitutions of Nb for Ti in the perovskite SrTiO3 give rise to electronic conductivity,[\cite=Nb_STO_Plamsons] [\cite=Nb-STO_ThinFilms] and even superconductivity.[\cite=Nb_SrTiO3_supercond] Nb-substituted SrTiO3 is widely used as a conducting substrate for epitaxial perovskite thin films. BaTiO3 which has a ferroelectric ground state,[\cite=Megaw] also substitutes Nb on the Ti site, and is known to form almost a complete solid solution with BaNbO3. Despite possessing the same cubic perovskite structure, depicted in Fig.[\ref=fig:structures](a), (at least for greater than 10 atom-% substitution) and identical electron counts, the Sr compounds display metallic behavior while the Ba compounds are localized up to at least 20% substitution.[\cite=Marucco_solidsol]

In order to unravel the possible structural underpinnings of the distinct behavior of the end-members in this solid solution series, we have prepared sample compositions with 12.5 % Nb-substitution: SrTi0.875Nb0.125O3 (STNO) and BaTi0.875Nb0.125O3 (BTNO), and studied their average and local structures using time of flight neutron diffraction measurements.

Samples were prepared from high purity (99.99%) Ba(Sr)CO3, TiO2 and Nb2O5 powders purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Pellets of stoichiometric amounts of the starting materials were calcined at 1100 [formula]C for 20 h in flowing H2, at a flow rate of 50 cm3/min, with a second regrinding/repelletization at 1350 [formula]C for 20 h in flowing H2. Four-probe resistivity was measured on 95% dense ceramic samples cut into [formula] mm3 parallelepipeds. Magnetic susceptibility in the 2 K to 400 K range was measured with a QD MPMS XL magnetometer. High-Q resolution neutron powder diffraction data were collected on the SrTi0.875Nb0.125O3 and BaTi0.875Nb0.125O3 samples on the NPDF instrument at the Los Alamos National Laboratory Lujan Neutron Scattering Center[\cite=proffen_npdf] at room temperature and at 15 K. Rietveld refinement of the diffraction data was carried out in the gsas-expgui[\cite=gsas-expgui] suite of programs. The experimental pair distribution function was extracted from neutron total scattering data using the program pdfgetn.[\cite=PDFGETN] The wavevector cutoff Qmax used for the transform was 40 Å- 1. PDF refinements were carried out using the pdfgui program.[\cite=PDFgui]

The distinct properties are amply illustrated by considering the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity and the magnetic susceptibility of the solid solution series Sr1 - xBaxTi0.9Nb0.1O3 displayed in the panels of Fig. [\ref=fig:rho-chi]. As the value of x (the amount of Ba) is increased across the solid solution, the resistivity (Fig. [\ref=fig:rho-chi]a) displays an upturn at low temperatures; the change from a positive to negative temperature coefficient of resistivity takes place between x = 0.25 and x = 0.50, in a region where the resistivity values are somewhat smaller than the value suggested by Mott for the minimum conductivity.[\cite=Mott] In correspondence with electrical transport, the magnetic susceptibility of the Sr-rich side of the solid solution is largely temperature-independent, in keeping with its metallic transport properties, while the Ba-rich samples display a stronger temperature dependence, characteristic of moments on localized electrons. One explanation that has been proffered for the magnetic behavior is the formation of bipolarons.[\cite=TK_PRL]

STNO and BTNO have very similar structures and lattice parameters. At room temperature, both compounds crystallize in the cubic perovskite [formula] structure. Nb-substitution results in small expansion of the cell edge as expected from the 6-coordinate Shannon-Prewitt radii, as Ti4 + (r = 0.61 Å) is either substituted by Ti3 + (r = 0.67 Å), Nb5 + (r = 0.64 Å), or Nb4 + (r = 0.68 Å).[\cite=Shannon] Rietveld refinement of time-of-flight neutron diffraction data confirms the average structures of both STNO and BTNO at room temperature are cubic. The only significant difference is in the cell parameters, with a = 3.9237(1) Å and a = 4.0147(1) Å respectively, in keeping with the much larger 12-coordinate radius of Ba2 + (r = 1.61 Å) compared with Sr2 + (r = 1.44 Å). Rietveld profile fits are displayed for STNO and BTNO at room temperature in Fig. [\ref=fig:rietveld]a and Fig. [\ref=fig:rietveld]c. At 15 K, BTNO remains cubic (Fig. [\ref=fig:rietveld]d), while STNO transforms between 298 K and 15 K to the tetragonal I4 / mcm low temperature structure of SrTiO3 (Fig. [\ref=fig:rietveld]b).[\cite=JauchPalmer] [\cite=Tucker] The structure is displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig:structures](b). In contrast to SrTiO3 where the octahedral rotational order parameter at 20 K is 1.97[formula],[\cite=Tucker] the value obtained here for STNO at 15 K is 3.46(2)[formula]. This larger value for the Nb-substituted compound reflects the slightly decreased tolerance factor.

Local structure was analyzed in terms of the atomic pair distribution function, G(r), using A8Ti7NbO24 supercells, as well as single-unit cell models with appropriate partial Ti/Nb occupancies. In Fig. [\ref=fig:PDF1], we compare the 15 K data and PDF fits to the average tetragonal structure of (a) SrTi0.875Nb0.125O3 and the average cubic structure of (b) BaTi0.875Nb0.125O3 to a maximum vector length of 50 Å. Both compounds are remarkably well described by the average structures over this range, suggesting that local effects due to Nb-substitution are small. A [formula] perovskite supercell with Nb at the center and Ti at all corners, faces, and cell edges provided a model for probing whether the coordination of NbO6 octahedra were distinct from those of TiO6 octahedra. Within the resolution of these experiments, no differences were discernible, supporting the analysis using an average B-occupation unit cell. Results of the PDF refinement are displayed alongside results of the Rietveld refinement in Table [\ref=table:structure]. Significant anomalies are found in the isotropic displacement parameters, Uiso for the two compounds. In SrTi0.875Nb0.125O3 it is seen at room temperature that Uiso is somewhat large on the A site (Sr) compared to the value found for Ba in BaTi0.875Nb0.125O3. This is a signature of the tilting instability that drives the cubic compound to transform to a tetragonal ground state, whereupon all values of Uiso at 15 K are somewhat more reasonable.[\cite=Megaw] In BaTi0.875Nb0.125O3 on the other hand, it is the B site (Ti/Nb) that has an anomalously large Uiso, both at 300 K and at 15 K.

Figure [\ref=fig:PDF2] (a through d) displays the short r PDFs of SrTi0.875Nb0.125O3 and BaTi0.875Nb0.125O3 at room temperature and at 15 K. For BaTi0.875Nb0.125O3 at 300 K and more markedly at 15 K, this first coordination shell is clearly bimodal. In contrast, the local structure of SrTi0.875Nb0.125O3 is undistorted and well-described by the crystallographic model. The local distortion in BaTi0.875Nb0.125O3 explains the larger B-site Uiso seen both in Rietveld and PDF results. This is the principal finding of this work, and points to a subtle yet fundamental difference in the local structures of these two compounds. To better understand the bimodal first (Ti/Nb)-O peak in the PDF of BaTi0.875Nb0.125O3, we show alongside in Fig. [\ref=fig:PDF2](e), simulations of the first peak PDF of BaTiO3 in its different crystalline structures: As it is cooled from high temperatures, BaTiO3 transitions successively from cubic [formula] to tetragonal P4mm to orthorhombic Amm2 to, finally, it's rhombohedral R3m ground state.[\cite=Megaw] [\cite=Kwei] In the rhombohedral structure, Ti atoms in BaTiO3 displace toward octahedral faces, resulting in three short and three long Ti-O distances, giving rise to a bimodal first peak in the PDF. This is precisely the situation in BaTi0.875Nb0.125O3. However in BaTiO3 local distortions are coherent and strain-coupled, and lead to phase transitions with associated changes in the average structure. In BaTi0.875Nb0.125O3, the random substitution of Ti by 12.5-atom% Nb is sufficient to frustrate long-range ordering, and the quality of cubic refinements support the idea that displacements of (Ti/Nb) are very poorly correlated.

The results of this work underpin the differences in the local structures of SrTi0.875Nb0.125O3 and BaTi0.875Nb0.125O3 which draw from the distinct ground states of the undoped compounds. The introduction of random potentials via Nb-substitution on the Ti site in BaTiO3, in addition to the introduction of charge carriers due to the aliovalent nature of the substitution, result in dipole-dipole correlations being rapidly suppressed. In particular, the role of charge carriers in bringing this about is dramatic. In systems where the substitution is isovalent, for example, BaTi1 - xSnxO3, ferroelectricity is suppressed only somewhat slowly.[\cite=BaTiSnO3] In keeping with ideas of "ferroelectric metals" (and their paucity), charge carriers screen the long-range electrostatic interactions responsible for ferroelectric order.[\cite=anderson] [\cite=sergienko] However, local effects that are responsible for off-centering, namely the second-order Jahn-Teller distortion on Ti4 +, are quite robust to changing electron counts, and persist even when long-range ordering of dipoles has been suppressed. The precise relation between local off-centering and localized electronic ground states in BaTi0.875Nb0.125O3 does not emerge from this study, except in that they suggest a means of lifting electronic degeneracy. In SrTi0.875Nb0.125O3, where distortions are not found, there is no symmetry-derived mechanism for lifting the Ti/Nb t2g electronic degeneracy.
