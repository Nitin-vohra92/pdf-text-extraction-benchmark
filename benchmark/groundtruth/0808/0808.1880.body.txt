Phantom Dark Energy Models with a Nearly Flat Potential

Introduction

Observations [\cite=Knop] [\cite=Riess] indicate that approximately 70% of the energy density in the universe is in the form of an exotic, negative-pressure component, dubbed dark energy. (See Ref. [\cite=Copeland] for a recent review). Taking w to be the ratio of pressure to density for the dark energy:

[formula]

recent observations suggest that w is close to - 1. For example, if w is assumed to be constant, then [formula] [\cite=Wood-Vasey] [\cite=Davis]. If we are interested in dynamical models for dark energy, such as those that arise from a scalar field φ, then such models can be significantly simplified in the limit that w is close to - 1. This fact was exploited in Ref. [\cite=SS], which examined quintessence models with a nearly flat potential, defined as a V(φ) satisfying the slow-roll conditions:

[formula]

and

[formula]

With these assumptions, it is possible to derive a generic expression for w as a function of the scale factor, a, that provides an excellent approximation to this entire class of potentials. (For other approaches to this problem, see Refs. [\cite=Crit] [\cite=Neupane] [\cite=Cahn]).

Here we extend these results to the case of phantom models, i.e., models for which w  <   - 1. It was first noted by Caldwell [\cite=Caldwell] that observational data do not rule out the possibility that w <  - 1. These phantom dark energy models have several interesting properties. The density of the dark energy increases with increasing scale factor, and the phantom energy density can become infinite at a finite time, a condition known as the "big rip" [\cite=Caldwell] [\cite=rip] [\cite=rip2]. Further, it has been suggested that the finite lifetime for the universe which is exhibited in these models may provide an explanation for the apparent coincidence between the current values of the matter density and the dark energy density [\cite=doomsday]. (See Ref. [\cite=Lineweaver] for a related, but different argument).

A simple way to achieve a phantom model is to take a scalar field Lagrangian with a negative kinetic term. Such models have well-known problems [\cite=Carroll] [\cite=Cline] [\cite=Hsu1] [\cite=Hsu2], but they nonetheless provide an interesting set of representative phantom models, and they have been widely studied [\cite=Guo] [\cite=ENO] [\cite=NO] [\cite=Hao] [\cite=Aref] [\cite=Peri] [\cite=Sami] [\cite=Faraoni] [\cite=Chiba] [\cite=KSS]. Here we assume a negative kinetic term, and then use techniques similar to those in Ref. [\cite=SS] to derive an expression for w(a) for phantom models satisfying conditions ([\ref=slow1]) and ([\ref=slow2]).

We assume a spatially-flat universe containing only nonrelativistic matter and phantom dark energy, since radiation can be neglected in the epoch of interest. Then

[formula]

where [formula], a is the scale factor, ρT is the total energy density, and we take c  =  8πG  =  1 throughout.

In a phantom model with negative kinetic term and potential V(φ), the energy density and pressure of the phantom are given by

[formula]

and

[formula]

so that the equation of state parameter is

[formula]

The evolution of φ is given by

[formula]

where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to φ. A field evolving according to equation ([\ref=phiev]) rolls uphill in the potential.

This equation of motion can be rewritten as [\cite=Chiba] [\cite=KSS]

[formula]

where Ωφ is the density of the phantom field in units of the critical density (note that Ωφ evolves with time). In equation ([\ref=Vprime/V]), [formula], so that x and w are related via

[formula]

(Note that in equation ([\ref=Vprime/V]) we use the sign convention in [\cite=KSS], rather than the one used in [\cite=Chiba]). Equation ([\ref=Vprime/V]) is the phantom version of the quintessence equation of motion first derived in Ref. [\cite=Steinhardt]; it differs from the quintessence equation only in the sign of 1 + w on the right-hand side.

We are interested in the limit where w is near - 1, so following Ref. [\cite=SS], we define [formula], where we take β to be small and positive. This will allow us to drop terms of higher order in β. Then equation ([\ref=Vprime/V]) becomes

[formula]

where we have defined [formula]. The fractional density in phantom dark energy, Ωφ, evolves as

[formula]

Combining equations ([\ref=betaprime]) and ([\ref=Omegaprime]) yields

[formula]

This can be compared to the corresponding equation for dγ / dΩ for quintessence, where γ  =  1 + w [\cite=SS]:

[formula]

Clearly, equations ([\ref=exact1]) and ([\ref=exact2]) predict that β(Ωφ) for a phantom field and γ(Ωφ) for a quintessence field will evolve quite differently. Now, however, we make our slow-roll assumptions. As in Ref. [\cite=SS], we take β  ≪  1 and we assume λ to be a constant, λ0, given by the initial value of [formula]. Both of these results are a consequence of equations ([\ref=slow1]) and ([\ref=slow2]); see Ref. [\cite=SS] for the details. Then equation ([\ref=exact1]) becomes

[formula]

This is identical to the equation one obtains, in the corresponding limit, for γ(Ωφ) for quintessence [\cite=SS]. Thus, in this limit, 1 + w(Ωφ) for quintessence and - 1 - w(Ωφ) for a phantom field evolve in exactly the same way. Using the exact solution for equation ([\ref=step2]) from Ref. [\cite=SS], we obtain

[formula]

Further, when 1 + w is close to - 1, we can approximate the solution to equation ([\ref=Omegaprime]) as [\cite=SS] [\cite=Crit]

[formula]

where Ωφ0 is the present-day value of Ωφ, and we take a = 1 at the present. Combining equations ([\ref=wOm]) and ([\ref=Oma]), and normalizing to w  =  w0 at present, we obtain:

[formula]

This equation is identical to the corresponding result for 1 + w for the case of quintessence [\cite=SS]. The fact that these two different models (phantom and quintessence) yield an identical form for (1 + w) / (1 + w0) is not a priori obvious; indeed, this result is valid only in the "slow roll" limit considered here.

We now compare the approximation given in equation ([\ref=wpred]) to exact numerical results. Kujat et al. [\cite=KSS] showed that phantom potentials with a negative kinetic term can be divided into three broad classes, depending on the late-time asymptotic behavior of [formula]. When [formula] at late times, wφ  →    -    ∞  . These models include, for instance, negative power laws. For models in which [formula] asymptotically approaches a constant, w also approaches a constant, w0, where w0  <   - 1. This class of models includes exponential potentials. Finally, when [formula] at late times, wφ  →   - 1. This class of models includes, for example, positive power law potentials. This final class of models, for which w  →   - 1, can be further subdivided into models which yield a future singularity (a "big rip"), and those which do not. The exact conditions necessary to avoid a big rip involve an integral function of V(φ) [\cite=KSS], but for power-law potentials, the condition is simpler: for V(φ)  =  φα, α  >  4 yields a big rip, while α  ≤  4 yields no future singularity [\cite=Sami] [\cite=KSS].

We have therefore chosen to compare our analytic approximation for w(a) with a model from each of these four classes. The results are displayed in Fig. 1. As in the case of quintessence, the agreement between the actual evolution and our approximation in equation ([\ref=wpred]) is remarkably good, with the error in w less than 0.5%. Our analytic approximation is well-fit by a linear relation, [\cite=CPL]

[formula]

in the regime a  >  0.5, which corresponds to a redshift z  <  1. Further, for the value of [formula] adopted here ([formula]), we have wa  ≈   - 1.5(1 + w0). This is the same relation between wa and w0 noted empirically for linear quintessence potentials [\cite=Kallosh], predicted for generic slow-roll quintessence models [\cite=SS], and derived analytically for linear quintessence potentials [\cite=Cahn]. (Note that the latter reference gives a value of - 1.3 rather than - 1.5, but this difference is not significant, as the result depends on the assumed value of Ωφ0 and on the assumed definition of wa; the latter is ambiguous since w(a) is not exactly linear in a in these models).

Given that equation ([\ref=wpred]) provides a generic prediction for the behavior of w(a) in a wide class of phantom models, it is useful to compare this prediction to the observations. Further, since both quintessence and phantom models produce the same generic form for w(a) in the limit where [formula] is small and nearly constant, we can combine the results for w(a) for quintessence models from Ref. [\cite=SS] with the results for w(a) for phantom models given here into a single likelihood plot. In Fig. 2, we compare this generic prediction for w(a) to the SNIa and baryon acoustic oscillation data. The likelihoods were constructed using the 60 Essence supernovae, 57 SNLS (Supernova Legacy Survey) and 45 nearby supernovae, and the data release of 30 SNe Ia detected by HST and classified as the Gold sample by Riess et al. [\cite=Riess]. The combined dataset can be found in Ref. [\cite=Davis]. We also add the measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale at zBAO  =  0.35 as observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey [\cite=sdss].

It is important to note that Fig. 2 combines two completely different models. The portion of the figure with w0  >   - 1 corresponds to quintessence models, while w0  <   - 1 corresponds to phantom models. We have simply taken advantage of the fact that both models yield the same form for w(a) as a function of w0 and [formula] in the limiting case where the potential is nearly flat.

Our main conclusion is that the analytic approximation previous derived for quintessence with a nearly flat potential [\cite=SS] has the same form when it is extended to phantom models with a negative kinetic term. Thus, the generic prediction for the evolution w at low redshift ([formula]) in such models, w(a)  =  w0 - 1.5(1 + w0)(1 - a), can be applied to both w0  >   - 1 and w0  <   - 1.
