Reply to "the Comment on 'Gauge Invariance and kT-Factorization of Exclusive Processes'" F. Feng1, J.P. Ma1 and Q. Wang2

Recently we have pointed out in [\cite=FMW] that the kT-factorization performed with off-shell partons is in general gauge variant and violated, because the perturbative coefficient function H contains gauge-dependent light-cone singularities and gauge-dependent μ-dependence. The kT-factorization for the transition π0  +  γ*  →  γ has been examined in [\cite=NLi] in Feynman gauge at one-loop level. It is claimed in [\cite=NLi] that the perturbative coefficient function H calculated with off-shell partons is gauge-invariant. A proof of the gauge invariance at any-loop level is given in [\cite=NLi], where one shows the gauge invariance at N + 1-loop level with the induction method by assuming the gauge invariance at N-loop level. But, the gauge invariance of the one-loop H(1) is not shown. This motivates us to study the problem in [\cite=FMW].

To determine the perturbative coefficient function H in the kT-factorization one replaces π0 with an off-shell quark pair. With the quark pair one calculates the form factor and the wave function. H receives contributions from the form factor and the wave function. In [\cite=FMW] it is shown with covariance arguments that the form factor does not contain the gauge-dependent light-cone singularities. The singularities come from wave functions. In the updated comment made by Li and Mishima[\cite=LiMi] a new method is proposed to calculate wave functions with off-shell partons. It is found that the gauge-dependent light-cone singularities disappear. In this updated reply we point out unacceptable flaws of the method.

The definition of the wave function for π0 moving in the z-direction is [\cite=FMW] [\cite=NLi]:

[formula]

We have taken the light-cone coordinate system in which π0 has the large momentum component P+. Lu is a gauge link along the direction uμ = (u+,u-,0,0) with u-  ≪  u+ and ζ is defined as ζ2  ≈  4(u  ·  P)2  /  u2. In the definition there is the momentum conservation in the +  - and transverse direction due to the translation invariance. Because of this and z+ = 0 all -  -components of momenta in loops are integrated over from -    ∞   to ∞  . It is noted that φ only depends on x,kT,ζ and μ as indicated in the above.

To extract the one-loop coefficient H(1) one needs to calculate φ of an off-shell parton pair instead of π0 at one-loop, as required in the kT-factorization[\cite=NLi]. Then one calculates the convolution of φ with H(0), i.e., [formula] as a part of contributions to H(1). The mentioned singularity in φ comes from Fig.2a, 2b and 2c in [\cite=FMW] [\cite=LiMi], where one has an integral of q- from -    ∞   to ∞  . q- is the component of the momentum q carried by the exchanged gluon in the figures, the component q+ and [formula] are fixed in φ by the momentum conservation. The integral can be performed by a standard contour integral in the q- complex-plane. One can takes a closed contour like those indicated in Fig.5 of [\cite=LiMi] for - R  ≤  q-  ≤  R at first step by adding semicircles. After the integration one takes the limit R  →    ∞  . In this limit one finds that all contributions to φ from semicircles in Fig.5 of [\cite=LiMi] are zero. The remaining contributions to φ are only from poles in the complex plane and contain the light-cone singularity[\cite=FMW] [\cite=LiMi]. In the limit the contribution φ2b from Fig.2b in [\cite=FMW] [\cite=LiMi] to φ is nonzero only for 0 < q+ < k+1 with [formula] as the momentum carried by the off-shell quark.

In [\cite=LiMi] it is suggested that one should keep these contributions to φ from the semicircles to calculate the convolution [formula], which contains integrations over x and kT. x is related to q+ through xP+  =  k+1 - q+ in [\cite=FMW] [\cite=LiMi]. After finishing the integrations in the convolution one then takes the limit R  →    ∞  . In this way the light-cone singularity disappears because the contributions from semicircles given in Fig.5 [\cite=LiMi] give nonzero contributions to the convolution in the limit. Since the limit is taken after the convolution, this implies that φ depends on an extra parameter R which is in fact a cut-off for the large |q-|. The existence of a finite R actually is in conflict with the translational invariance. We take the contribution φ2b as an example to illustrate this in more detail in the following.

It is well-known that the wave function in Eq.(1) is zero for x < 0 and x > 1. The boundary x = 1 can be obtained by inserting a complete sum of intermediate states in Eq.(1) and using the translational invariance. With the finite R φ2b is not zero for q+ < 0. This nonzero contribution is crucial to cancel the light-cone singularity of φ2b with q+ > 0[\cite=LiMi]. If one takes the limit R  →    ∞   before the convolution, φ2b is zero for q+ < 0. From the translation invariance one can show that φ2b or contributions from similar class of diagrams are zero for q+ < 0 without any calculation. The contributions from Fig.2b in [\cite=FMW] [\cite=LiMi] and its higher-order corrections, in which there is no gluon attached to the antiquark line and the gauge link Lu(  ∞  ,z), are actually proportional to the contributions to a distribution of a single quark with the momentum k1. The distribution can be defined by replacing π0 in Eq.(1) with the single off-shell quark and delete some operators in Eq.(1) as in the following:

[formula]

φ2b is proportional to one of the leading order contributions of the above distribution with xP+  =  yk+1. Inserting a complete sum of intermediate states and using the translation invariance, we have that the above distribution must be zero for y > 1. Here y is related to q+ through yk+1  =  k+1 - q+. One can conclude without any calculation that the above distribution and φ2b must be zero for q+ < 0, or the contributions from similar diagrams are zero if the out going quark line carries a +  -momentum component is larger than that of the incoming quark line. This conclusion is in agreement with the physical expectation that partons entering hard scattering have positive +  -energy. Therefore, φ2b  ≠  0 with q+ < 0 is in conflict with the translation invariance. To avoid the conflict one has to take the limit R  →    ∞   before the convolution. This results in φ2b  =  0 for q+ < 0.

In fact there is certain ambiguity in φ2b if one does not take the limit R  →    ∞  . In the method, one actually changes the order of the integrations in the convolution [formula] with the q--integration in φ2b by implementing certain prescriptions, where one first deforms the contours along the real axis in the q--plane for the q--integral in φ to those in Fig.5 of [\cite=LiMi]. With these contours one finds the nonexistence of the light-cone singularity. If one flips the closed contour in Fig.5b of [\cite=LiMi], i.e., by changing the contour in the upper-half q--plane into the lower-half q--plane, one will find a different result from Fig.5b than that given in Eq.(12) of [\cite=LiMi] by noting that fact: The contribution from the single pole in the upper-half q--plane is the same as that from the double pole in the lower-half q--plane, and with the flipped contour the corresponding integral of θ from π  →  0 in Eq.(12) of [\cite=LiMi] is changed to that of θ from -  π  →  0. The final results with the flipped contour will still contain the light-cone singularity. The cancelation of the light-cone singularity only happens with certain contours like those given in Fig.5 of [\cite=LiMi]. This is in conflict with the general expectation that physical results should not depend contours used for loop-integrals.

It is interesting to note that one will not find the singularity in the convolution if one simply changes the order of the integrations of [formula] by ignoring the constraint of allowed q+-regions from the translational invariance, where one first integrates over q+ by taking the region with q+ < 0 into account and then perform the integration over q-. However, from the translational invariance we know that the region with q+ < 0 should be excluded in the integration of q+. Taking this into account, φ2b and its convolution with H(0) has the mentioned light-cone singularity.

The above discussion tells that the final results with the method will depend on chosen contours. The method implies a modification for the wave function of parton states through implementing a cut-off and specially chosen contours. It is unclear how to implement the modification to the wave function at hadron level, i.e., to that in Eq.(1). With the implement the calculated wave function is in fact no longer the wave function employed in the kT-factorization in Eq.(1). Since the results obtained with the method are in conflict with the translational invariance and depend on the chosen contours, the proposed method is in principle unacceptable.

To conclude: In the suggested method of [\cite=LiMi] an extra cut-off is introduced into wave functions and special contours for -  -components of loop momenta are taken. The results obtained with the method are in conflict with the translation invariance and depend on the chosen contours. Therefore, the method is in principle unacceptable and the obtained result with the method can not be correct.
