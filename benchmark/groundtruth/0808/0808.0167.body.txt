Moduli Space of CR-Projective Complex Foliated Tori

Introduction

A complex foliated torus or CR-torus is defined as [formula], where [formula] is a lattice. The natural projection of [formula] on [formula] induces a foliation of [formula] whose leaves are complex manifolds of dimension n. Hence, [formula] is a compact Levi-flat manifold. Complex foliated tori are related to quasi-Abelian varieties, i.e. to quotients of [formula] by a discrete subgroup. In fact, any quasi-Abelian variety, as real manifold, is diffeomorphic to the product of a CR-torus and a real linear vector space (see e.g. [\cite=AG1], [\cite=AG2]). For more details and results on quasi-Abelian varieties we refer to [\cite=AK], [\cite=CC]. In this paper we consider complex foliated tori endowed with a polarization ω, namely ω is a bilinear skew-symmetric form on [formula] taking integral values on Γ  ×  Γ and such that its restriction to [formula] is the imaginary part of a positive definite Hermitian form on [formula]. The existence of a polarization on a complex foliated torus [formula] is equivalent to the CR-embeddability into a projective space, i.e. to the existence of an analytic embedding of [formula] into a projective space that is holomorphic along the leaves (see [\cite=CT] and the references included). We will call CR-projective such tori. Note that the definition of polarization we take in consideration here is more general of that one considered in [\cite=CT]. We define the moduli space of CR-projective tori and we show that it is a normal complex analytic space (see Theorem [\ref=principale]). In order to do this, we will present the space of period matrices as a subset of the Grassmannian of n-complex planes in [formula].

The authors would like to dedicate this paper to the memory of Nicolangelo Medori.

Preliminaries

Let [formula] be endowed with the natural CR-structure. A complex foliated torus or CR-torus is a torus

[formula]

where Γ is a lattice in [formula], with the natural CR-structure induced by [formula]. Note that the projection [formula] gives rise to a foliation on [formula], whose leaves are complex manifolds of dimension n. Let (z,t) denote any point of [formula]. A CR-map [formula] is a smooth map of the form

[formula]

where f is holomorphic with respect to z. A CR-map between complex foliated tori [formula] and [formula] is given by a CR-map

[formula]

such that (Γ)  ⊂  Γ'. The following lemma characterizes the CR-maps between complex foliated tori.

Let [formula] and [formula] be complex foliated tori and [formula] be a CR-map. Then φ is induced by a CR-map [formula] given by

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula] and

[formula]

do not depend on z, are Γ-periodic and (β(0),γ(0)) belongs to Γ'.

As already remarked, φ is induced by [formula],

[formula]

such that, f(z,t) is a holomorphic map of z, for any [formula]. As for the case of complex tori (see e.g. [\cite=BL]) we get

[formula]

where A(t) and B(t) are a n  ×  n complex matrix and a vector of [formula] respectively, both depending on t. Since

[formula]

for any [formula], [formula], we have:

[formula]

By taking into account [\eqref=CRmap1], then [\eqref=CRmapderivative1] implies that

[formula]

By a CR-change of coordinates in [formula], we may assume that the lattice Γ contains points of the form (0,τ). Hence, evaluating the last expression for z = 0 and ζ = 0 , we obtain

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Then [\eqref=CRmapderivative3] and [\eqref=CRmapderivative2] imply that

[formula]

and

[formula]

where Aijh, B = (Bih) are constant and αij, β are periodic. Now we are going to show that

[formula]

Differentiating [\eqref=CRmap2] with respect to z and taking onto account [\eqref=CRmap1], we obtain

[formula]

Therefore [\eqref=A] and [\eqref=B] imply that

[formula]

Hence Aijh = 0. By [\eqref=CRmapderivative3] we get

[formula]

Therefore A is constant and the proposition is proved.

Let [formula] be a complex foliated torus. Let

[formula]

[formula], be a [formula]-basis of Γ. Then

[formula]

is called a period matrix of [formula]. Observe that Ω depends on the choice of the [formula]-basis of Γ. We have the following

Let [formula] and [formula] be complex foliated tori. Denote by Ω and Ω' period matrices for [formula] and [formula] respectively. Then [formula] and [formula] are CR-isomorphic if and only if there exists

[formula]

with [formula], and [formula] such that

[formula]

If there exist M and P as in [\eqref=toriequivalence], then the map (z,t) = (Az + Bt,Ct) induces a CR-diffeomorphism between [formula] and [formula]. Vice versa, if [formula] is a diffeomorphism, then Lemma [\ref=CRmaptori] implies that (z,t) = (Az + Bt + β(t),Ct + γ(t)). Since (β(0),γ(0))∈Γ', then [\eqref=toriequivalence] holds.

We will denote by Ln,k the group of matrices given by

[formula]

Two period matrices Ω and Ω' are said to be equivalent if they satisfy condition [\eqref=toriequivalence] for some M∈Ln,k, [formula]. By definition, the moduli space of complex foliated tori is the quotient Mn,k of the space of period matrices modulo the equivalence relation [\eqref=toriequivalence]. It can be checked that any equivalence class of period matrices has a representative Ω of the following form

[formula]

We will call adapted such a period matrix.

Moduli of polarized complex foliated tori

Let [formula] be a complex foliated torus.

A polarization on [formula] is given by a skew-symmetric bilinear form ω on [formula] such that:

ω|Γ  ×  Γ takes integral values;

[formula] is the imaginary part of a positive definite Hermitian form on [formula].

A complex foliated torus [formula] is said to be CR-projective if it can be CR-embedded into a [formula]. It turns out that a complex foliated torus [formula] is CR-projective if and only if there exists a polarization ω on [formula] (see [\cite=CT]). For a CR-embedding theorem of a compact Levi-flat manifold of codimension one can see [\cite=OS].

A pair [formula] is said to be a polarized complex foliated torus. Two polarized complex foliated tori [formula] and [formula] are said to be equivalent if there exists a CR-diffeomorphism [formula] such that the restrictions of ω and φ*ω' to [formula] coincide.

Any polarized complex foliated torus [formula] is equivalent to [formula], where ω is represented by

[formula]

and [formula] has an adapted period matrix. To show this, set [formula]. Let

[formula]

be a period matrix for [formula]. By changing the order of the columns of Ω' we may assume that R' is invertible. Then, by acting on the left with

[formula]

where A∈U(n), we obtain that Ω is an adapted period matrix and that the restriction of φ*ω' to [formula] is still η, since A∈U(n) (where φ is the CR-diffeomorphism represented by the matrix M). As for the complex case, there exist [formula] with [formula], such that the polarization ω can be represented by the matrix

[formula]

where Δ is the diagonal matrix having diagonal entries [formula] (see e.g. [\cite=D], [\cite=GH]).

Let

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] be two complex foliated tori endowed with the same polarization ω. As observed in Remark [\ref=adaptedform], we may assume that ω has the canonical form given by [\eqref=canonicalform] and Ω and Ω' are adapted period matrices of [formula] and [formula] respectively. We say that Ω and Ω' are equivalent if there exist M∈Fn,k and P∈Hn,k such that

[formula]

The moduli space of CR-projective complex foliated tori is the quotient Mωn,k of the space of period matrices modulo the equivalence relation [\eqref=polarizedtoriequivalence].

We are going to describe explicitly the space of period matrices. Let Ω be an adapted period matrix for the polarized complex foliated torus [formula]. Denote by [formula] the column vectors of Ω. Set

[formula]

Then J defines a complex structure on the real vector space V spanned by [formula]. These vectors give an [formula]-isomorphism f between V and [formula] by setting [formula]. In this way (V,J) is isomorphic to [formula]. Then

[formula]

is a J-invariant inner product on V. Then, by setting

[formula]

we get that the complex n-plane [formula] satisfies

[formula]

where [formula] is the complexification of ω. Hence, we have proved the following

The space of period matrices of CR-projective complex foliated tori is given by

[formula]

As a consequence of the previous proposition we get the following

The space of period matrices of CR-projective complex foliated tori is a Kähler manifold of complex dimension [formula].

Now we can describe the moduli space (for the case of Abelian varieties see e.g. [\cite=BL], [\cite=D]). We have the following

The moduli space Mωn,k of CR-projective complex foliated tori is given by

[formula]

Any discrete subgroup of Hn,k acts properly discontinuously on Uωn,k. In particular, Mωn,k is a normal analytic space.

By Proposition [\ref=period], we immediately get that [formula]. Now, we show that any discrete subgroup G of Hn,k acts properly discontinuously on Uωn,k. Consider two compact sets K1 and K2 in Uωn,k. Let

[formula]

such that [formula]. Let [formula] and set V'M  =  M- 1VM. Denote by J and J' be the corresponding complex structures on VM and V'M, respectively. Then we have

[formula]

and the same holds for V'M. Take a symplectic basis [formula] of VM and let [formula]. Then, with respect to the bases B and B' of VM and V'M respectively (denoting with the same letters the matrices for J, J' and ω), we have J' = αJα- 1 and, consequently, [formula]. Therefore, [formula] and [formula] are symmetric and positive definite matrices. Hence, there exist two orthogonal matrices Q, Q' such that

[formula]

where D and D' are diagonal and positive definite matrices. By taking into account the previous relations, we get [formula], where S = QαQ', so that S varies in a compact set. Therefore, α lies in a compact set. By the definition of the action, it can be easily checked that also β varies in a compact set. Hence G is finite.
