Beilinson-Hodge cycles on semiabelian varieties

Given a smooth not necessarily proper complex variety U, Beilinson [\cite=beilinson] conjectured that all Hodge cycles in [formula] come from motivic cohomology, or more precisely that the so called regulator map

[formula]

from Bloch's higher Chow group [\cite=bloch] is surjective. This is a very natural and appealing statement which includes the usual Hodge conjecture. Unfortunately, it has turned out that it is not true in this generallity, c.f. [\cite=jannsen], [\cite=kl]. There is presumably a restricted range of (i,j) for which this conjecture is viable. For instance the line j = 0, which corresponds to the usual Hodge conjecture, should lie in this set. Work of Asakura and Saito [\cite=as] suggests that the conjecture should also hold when i = j. Following these authors, we refer to this special case as the Beilinson-Hodge conjecture.

Our goal here is to prove the Beilinson-Hodge conjecture when U is either a semiabelian variety or a product of smooth curves. The method is based on the study of invariants under the Mumford-Tate group.

Reduction lemma

We recall [\cite=bloch] [\cite=levine] that given a variety U, Bloch has defined a bigraded abelian group [formula]. The elements are represented by certain codimension i algebraic cycles on [formula]. There are products

[formula]

when U is smooth. A cycle [formula], representing an element of CHi(U,j), has a fundamental class in

[formula]

where [formula] is a union of the hyperplanes corresponding to the faces of [formula] when viewed as an algebraic simplex. This extends to a homomorphism

[formula]

This description was indicated in [\cite=bloch]. Other explicit constructions of this map can be found in [\cite=klm], and [\cite=as] for the subgroup of decomposable cycles. From these formulas, it is clear that the map respects products, and the special case

[formula]

is just the composition of the inclusion O(U)*  ⊂  Oan(U)* with the connecting map associated to the exponential sequence.

It is convenient to define the space of Beilinson-Hodge cycles

[formula]

Then the Beilinson-Hodge conjecture asserts that CHq(U,q) surjects onto BHq(U). Note that the conjecture is only interesting for open varieties, because it is vacuously true if the variety is proper, since BH* = 0 in this case by [\cite=deligne-hodge]. The first nontrivial case of the conjecture, when q = 1, turns out to be easy to understand and prove, even integrally. It is not unreasonable to attribute this to Abel, since it is closely related to his classical theorem.

For any smooth variety U, the map

[formula]

is surjective

Choose a smooth compactification X such that D = X - U has normal crossings. Let dOanU denote the image of d:OanU  →  Ωan1U in the category of sheaves. The group [formula] is torsion free by the universal coefficient theorem, so it can be viewed as a subgroup of [formula]. An element in [formula] is in BH1(U) if and only if it lies in F1H1(U) =  ker [null]. Chasing the following commutative diagram, with exact rows,

[formula]

shows that the set of these classes coincides with {δ(f)|d log (f)∈H0(ΩX( log D))}. The condition d log (f)∈H0(ΩX( log D)) can be seen to force f to have singularities of finite order along D. Thus

[formula]

If the products [formula] are surjective for all q, then the Beilinson-Hodge conjecture holds for U.

This follows from the following commutative diagram and theorem 1.1

[formula]

Mumford-Tate groups

The category of rational mixed Hodge structures form a neutral Tannakian category over [formula] [\cite=dm]. Let 〈H〉 denote the Tannakian category generated by a mixed Hodge structure H. This is the full subcategory consisting of all subquotients of tensor powers [formula]. This construction extends to any set of Hodge structures. The Mumford-Tate group MT(H) is the group of tensor automorphisms of the forgetful functor from 〈H〉 to [formula]-vector spaces. By Tannaka duality 〈H〉 is equivalent to the category of representations of this group. When H is a pure Hodge structure, MT(H) can be defined in a more elementary fashion as the smallest [formula]-algebraic group whose real points contains the image of the torus defining the Hodge structure. We define two auxillary groups. The extended Mumford-Tate group EMT(H) is [formula], and it surjects onto MT(H). (Some authors consider EMT(H) to be the Mumford-Tate group). The special Mumford-Tate group SMT(H)  =   ker [null] with respect to the map that is induced by the inclusion [formula].

If [formula] (respectively [formula] with [formula]) lies in 〈H〉, then MT(H) is isomorphic (respectively isogenous) to EMT(H). Otherwise [formula].

MT(H)  ⊂  GL(H) is the largest subgroup leaving every rational element of type (0,0) in Tm,nH invariant for all m,n. SMT(H) leaves rational elements of type (q,q) in Tm,nH invariant for all m,n,q.

If H is pure and polarizable, then MT(H) is connected and reductive.

Let [formula], then MT(H) is a semidirect product of MT(Hsplit) with a unipotent group.

For the first statement, see [\cite=milne]. The next two properties are standard and proved in [\cite=dm], although [\cite=andre] would be a more concise reference. The last part is essentially given in [\cite=andre]. We indicate the proof for completeness. Let P be the group linear automorphisms of H preserving the flag [formula]. The unipotent radical UP  ⊂  P is the subgroup which acts trivially on GrWk. We have inclusion of tensor categories

[formula]

with a right inverse H'  ↦  (H')split. Therefore we get a split surjection of Tannaka duals ι*:MT(H)  →  MT(Hsplit). The kernel ι* lies in UP, and is therefore unipotent.

MT(Hsplit) is the quotient of MT(H) by its unipotent radical.

Let us turn to the case where U is either a semiabelian variety or a smooth curve. Set MT(U)  =  MT(H1(U)) = EMT(H1(U)), where the last equality follows from the theorem. Also let SMT(U)  =  SMT(H1(U)).

Let H = H1(U) and let W  =  W1H = H1(X). Choose a complementary subspace V to W in H. We also know that MT(U) preserves the weight filtration on H1(U) ([\cite=andre]). Hence Φ the kernel of MT(H)  →  MT(Hsplit) and the unipotent radical of MT(U) is a subspace of [formula].

As a subgroup of [formula]

Main theorem

Let H be the first cohomology of a semiabelian variety or a smooth affine curve. We want to refine the description of SMT(H) given by corollary [\ref=cor:SMT]. We define three subspaces Vi  ⊂  H. Let V3  =  W1H, let V1  ⊆  HSMT(H) be a complement to V3 in W1H + HSMT(H), and finally choose V2 to be a complement to V1 + V3 in H. Thus we have a decomposition

[formula]

with respect to which SMT(H) becomes a subgroup of the following matrix group:

[formula]

The unipotent radical U(SMT(H)) lies in the subgroup

[formula]

For any nonzero u∈V2, we can find a g∈U(SMT(H)) such that [formula], or equivalently such that [formula] with respect to the matrix ([\ref=eq:USMT]).

Given a nonzero u∈V2, we have [formula] for some g1∈SMT(H). Writing

[formula]

we see that [formula]. Set

[formula]

This lies in SMT(H), since the map SMT(H)  →  SMT(H) / U(SMT(H)) splits. Then g = g1g2 has the desired property.

Let

[formula]

for H as above.

The product maps [formula] are surjective for all q

To simplify book keeping, we will usually write tuples [formula] as strings [formula]. Juxtaposition is used to denote concatenation of strings, with exponents used for repetition. For example, 12  2  30  =  1  1  2.

([\ref=eq:decompH]) leads to a decomposition

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let τ∈BHn(H) i.e. suppose that it is a Beilinson-Hodge cycle. Our goal is to show that [formula]. Let us decompose

[formula]

with respect to [\eqref=eq:decompHn]. It suffices to show that [formula], since V1  ⊆  BH1(H). After replacing τ by τ  -  τ1n, we will show τ equals 0.

We next argue that any component [formula] with all of the ji∈{1,2} must be zero. Assume that [formula], then we will derive a contradiction. Let

[formula]

with xi∈Vji. From the previous paragraph, [formula] must have at least one 2. Since u  =  xn1 + 1∈V2  -  {0}, we can choose a g∈U(SMT(H)) so that [formula], with f as in [\eqref=eq:USMT]. Then gτ'  -  τ' will have a nonzero component in [formula]. We must have gτ  -  τ = 0, since τ is invariant under SMT(H) by theorem [\ref=thm:charofMT]. Thus τ must have another term τ'' whose image under g - I has a nonzero component of type [formula]. The only possible candidate is [formula]. However, after expanding this as a product of xi's as above, we can see that (g - I)τ'' has no nonzero components of the required type. For example, (g - I)τ'' = 0 if the second 2 is absent from [formula], (g - I)τ'' is sum of types 1n1321n3,1n1321n3 and 1n1231n3 if [formula] and so on. Therefore τ' = 0 as claimed.

To conclude, we note that the projection of a nonzero Beilinson-Hodge cycle to [formula] must be nonzero. We deduce from the previous paragraph that for every component of τ, must have at least one ji = 3. This implies that τ projects to zero in [formula]. Therefore it must already be zero.

The Beilinson-Hodge conjecture holds for a product of smooth curves.

Let [formula], where Ui are smooth curves. Let H = H1(U). Then by Künneth's formula and the theorem, the conditions of lemma [\ref=lemma:key] hold.

The Beilinson-Hodge conjecture holds for a semiabelian variety.

Let U be a semiabelian variety. Let H  =  H1(U). By the theorem, we have that [formula]. Now observe that [formula] which is a direct summand of the tensor algebra. So the BH cycles on Hn(U) are given by products of BH-cycles on H.

The referee pointed out the following interesting corollary which can be proved along the same lines as the first corollary.

Let [formula] be a product of n smooth curves with smooth projective completions Xi. Then [formula] if and only if there exists torsion cycles in J(Xi) with nonempty support on Xi - Ui for each i.

Using the theorem, this can be reduced to the case of n = 1. By theorem [\ref=thm:abel], a nonzero element of BH1(U1) lifts to an element [formula], which in turn defines a divisor [formula] with nonempty support in X1 - U1. Conversely, any such [formula]-divisor determines a nonzero element of BH1(U1)
