Introduction and the main result

In 1886, Weierstrass gave an example of a transcendental entire function which takes rational values at all rational points. He also suggested that there exist transcendental entire functions which take algebraic values at any algebraic point. Later, in [\cite=Sta1], St[formula]ckel proved that for each countable subset [formula] and each dense subset [formula], there is a transcendental entire function f such that f(Σ)  ⊆  T. Another construction due to St[formula]ckel produces an entire function f whose derivatives f(s), for [formula] all map [formula] into [formula], see [\cite=Sta2]. A more thorough discussion on this subject can be found in [\cite=Mah]. There are recent results due to Andrea Surroca on the number of algebraic points where a transcendental analytic function takes algebraic values, see [\cite=Su2]. We were able to generalize these two results of St[formula]ckel to the following general theorem.

Given a countable subset [formula] and for each integer s  ≥  0 with α∈A, fix a dense subset [formula]. Then there exists a transcendental entire function [formula] such that f(s)(α)∈Eα,s, for all α∈A and all s  ≥  0.

Let f be given, and denote by Sf the set of all algebraic points [formula], for which f(α) is also algebraic. An interesting problem is to determine properties of Sf, which we name as the exceptional set of f. In the conclusion we will show that for any [formula] there is a transcendental entire function f such that A is the exceptional set of f.

Without referring to Theorem 1, we have the following special examples:

These examples are just special case of our Theorem 1, hitherto can be proved uniformly here.

Preliminary results

Before going to the proof of the theorem, we need couple of lemmas.

Let {Pn(z)}n  ≥  0 be a sequence of complex polynomials, where deg Pn = n. And let {Cn}n  ≥  0 be a sequence of positive constants providing that |Pn(z)|  ≤  Cn max {|z|,1}n. If a sequence of complex numbers {an}n  ≥  0 satisfies [formula], then the series [formula] converges absolutely and uniformly on any compact sets, particularly this gives an entire function.

When [formula], we have:

[formula]

so [formula] converges absolutely and uniformly on any compact sets. Therefore this series will produce an entire function.

Now, let's enumerate the set A in Theorem 1 as [formula]

For n  ≥  1, setting [formula], where mn  ≥  0 and 1  ≤  jn  ≤  mn  +  1. Next, construct a sequence of polynomials as follows

P0(z)  =  1 and define recursively Pn(z)  =  (z - αjn)Pn - 1(z) for n  ≥  1

Here we list the first few polynomials:

[formula]

For convenience, let's denote in = mn + 1 - jn. For any given [formula] and [formula] there exists a unique [formula] such that in = i and jn = j, namely [formula].

For n  ≥  1, we have [formula] and P(in)l(αjn) = 0 when l  ≥  n.

From the definition of Pn(z), we can write explicitly

[formula]

It follows that αjn is a zero of Pn - 1(z) with multiplicity in, which means P(in)n - 1(αjn)  ≠  0. On the other hand, if l  ≥  n, then αjn is a zero of Pl(z) with multiplicity at least in + 1, which implies P(in)l(αjn) = 0.

If [formula] for all [formula], then ak = bk for each k  ≥  0.

It suffice to prove that if [formula] for all [formula], then {ak}k  ≥  0 is identically 0. Notice that a0 = g(α1) = 0. Assuming [formula] are all 0, by Lemma 2, we have

[formula]

Since P(in + 1)n(αjn + 1)  ≠  0, we have an = 0. Hence the proof will be completed by induction.

Now we are able to prove our theorem.

Proof of the theorem

We are going to construct the desired transcendental entire function by fixing the coefficients in the series [formula] recursively, where the sequence {Pk}k  ≥  0 has been defined in Section 2.

First, by Lemma 1, the condition [formula] will ensure [formula] to be entire.

Now we will fix the coefficients ak recursively. For n  ≥  1, we denote En = Eαjn,in and let the numbers [formula]. We are going to choose the value of ak so that βn∈Eαjn,in = En for all n  ≥  1.

By Lemma 2, we know that P(in)l(αjn) = 0 when l  ≥  n, so βn is actually the finite sum [formula]. Notice that β1 = a0P(0)0(α1) = a0 and E1 is dense, we can fix a value for a0 such that [formula] and β1∈E1. Now suppose that the values of [formula] are well fixed such that [formula] and βk∈Ek for 0  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1. By Lemma 2, we know [formula], so we can pick a proper value of an such that [formula] and [formula].

So now by induction all the ak are well chosen such that for all k  ≥  1 we have [formula] and βk∈Ek. Thus by Lemma 1, the function [formula] is an entire function and for any [formula] we have [formula] where n is the unique integer such that in = i,jn = j. Taking into account that every polynomial could be expressed as a finite linear combination of the {Pk}, and all the {ak} here are not 0, so by Lemma 3 we conclude that f(z) is not a polynomial. Hence f(z) is the desired transcendental entire function.

From the construction of the proof, we can easily see that in fact there are uncountably many functions satisfying the properties required in Theorem 1.

Applications to Exceptional Sets

We recall the following definition

Let f be an entire function. We define the exceptional set of f to be

[formula]

We list some of the more interesting consequences of Theorem 1 with the choice of A, Eα,s noted in parentheses.

For each countable subset [formula] and each dense subset [formula] there is a transcendental entire function f such that f(s)(Σ)  ⊆  T for s  ≥  0. (A  =  Σ, Eα,s  =  T)

Let [formula] be countable and dense in [formula], then there is a transcendental entire function f such that f(s)(A)  ⊆  A, for s  ≥  0. (Eα,s  =  A)

There exists a transcendental entire function such that [formula], for s  ≥  0. ([formula])

The next result shows that in particular every [formula] is an exceptional set of a transcendental entire function.

If [formula], then there is a transcendental entire function, such that Sf(s)  =  A for s  ≥  0.

Suppose that A and [formula] are both infinite, thus we can enumerate [formula] where A  =  {α1,α3,...,α2n + 1,...}. Set [formula] and [formula] for all n,s  ≥  0. Now by Theorem 1, there exists a transcendental entire function f with [formula] and [formula], for each n,s  ≥  0. Therefore it is plain that Sf(s)  =  A.

For the case that A is finite, we can suppose A  =  {α1,...,αm}. Take [formula] for all s  ≥  0, and set [formula] for all k > m,s  ≥  0. In case, [formula], we take [formula] for all s  ≥  0, and set [formula] for all k > m,s  ≥  0. Then for these two cases we proceed as in the proof above.
