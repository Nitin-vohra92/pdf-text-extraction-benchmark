Introduction

Premise

Piezoelectricity is the property of generating an electric field (mechanical stress) in response to an applied mechanical stress (electric field); pyroelectricity is the property of generating an electric field (temperature change) by a temperature change (electric field).

For a piezothermoelastic body a natural problem, useful for practical applications, is to study the electromechanical effects due to a prescribed temperature on part of the boundary.

The present paper is a starting study of boundary control problems in plate-like bodies exhibiting pyroelectricity. This in order to theoretically establish whether and under which boundary conditions a given boundary temperature and/or electric potential can be usefully employed to obtain some type of control, e.g. on temperature and/or electric potential, in a given material surface. This theoric study may be useful with regard to real panels subject to sun exposure or lying in contact with an external heat source, in order e.g. to passively exploit this boundary condition.

Here we define first a general boundary control problem and then study the particular problem of a plate occupied by a material exhibiting piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties.

Static Boundary Value Problem for a Piezothermoelastic body

Here we adopt the summation convention and comma notation for partial derivatives, so that [formula] and   f,  i  =  ∂f / ∂xi.

Consider a piezothermoelastic body B that, in the reference configuration, occupies a region V with boundary surface S. The deformation of the body is described by

[formula]

where yi denote the spatial coordinates and XL the reference coordinates of material points with respect to the same Cartesian coordinate system.

The Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor, electric displacement vector, and heat flux vector are respectively given by constitutive functions

[formula]

[formula]

where   θ,  φ,  Ei =  - φ,  i,  EAB = (yi,Ayi,B  -  δAB) / 2   are the absolute temperature, electric potential, electric field and strain tensor, respectively.

Balance law of linear momentum, Maxwell's equation, and balance law of conservation of energy, respectively lead to the equilibrium relations

[formula]

where   ρo   is the mass-density in the reference configuration,   fl   is the body force per unit mass,   ρe   is the body free charge density, and   γ   is the body heat source per unit mass.

To describe the corresponding boundary conditions, three partitions   (Si1,Si2),   i = 1,  2,  3, of the boundary surface S = ∂B can be assigned. For mechanical boundary conditions, displacement [formula] and traction [formula] per unit undeformed area are prescribed, respectively, on   S11   and   S12; for electric boundary conditions, electric potential [formula] and surface-free charge [formula] per unit undeformed area are prescribed, respectively, on   S21   and   S22; while for thermic boundary conditions, temperature [formula] and normal heat flux [formula] per unit undeformed area are prescribed, respectively,on   S31   and   S32. Hence, we can write

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] is the unit exterior normal on   S   and   T = θ  -  θo   is the incremental temperature with respect to the temperature   θo   in the reference state.

The boundary value problem is then stated as: to find the solution [formula] in   B   to the constitutive relations ([\ref=eq:tLk]), ([\ref=eq:DL]) and field equilibrium equations ([\ref=eq:locEq]) which satisfies the boundary conditions ([\ref=eq:yiyi])-([\ref=eq:T]) for given [formula].

Of course, existence and uniqueness of the solution must be separately examined, but here are assumed.

Boundary Control Problem

Let   So   be a regular surface contained in [formula] (possibly   So  ⊂  ∂B), with oriented normal unit vector [formula], let   C  :  So  →  I  R   be a scalar smooth function, and let   χ   be any one of the ten quantities [formula]

φ  ,  θ  ,  DLNL  ,  qLNL  ,  ui,  tLi  NL  (i = 1,  2,  3)  .

The boundary control problem for χ on So with goal C, (abbreviated to   BCP  χ|So = C), is the following: For arbitrary   n  ( < 10)   boundary conditions of the type ([\ref=eq:yiyi])-([\ref=eq:T]), choose the remaining   10 - n   boundary conditions in ([\ref=eq:yiyi])-([\ref=eq:T]) such that the solution [formula] to the corresponding boundary value problem yields   χ|So = C.

The Boundary Control Problems solved here

In the present paper, we solve some boundary control BCP, for certain linear piezothermoelastic bodies, that occupy a plate   P   infinite in extent and bounded by two parallel planes. The plate has a natural equilibrium state, i.e., with no initial field, and is occupied by a heat-conducting piezoelectric material with the symmetry of the hexagonal crystal class   C6ν = 6mm, so that ferroelectric ceramics are included. We assume that   P   is subject to a constant temperature on the upper face that in effect may vary slowly with time. On the lower face, the displacement is prescribed, as when, for example,   P   is welded to a fixed flat body.

We study processes which are homogeneous on each plane parallel to the boundary planes, that is, they depend only on the thickness coordinate, and, moreover, vary very slowly with time. The precise equilibrium boundary value problems studied are summarized in the table and are completely solved once their exact solutions are determined.

In these problems, we take n = 9 and   So   any fixed plane parallel to the plane boundaries of the plate. In BCP.s I.1.3 and I.3.3 either χ = T or χ  =  φ, i.e., either temperature or electric potential can be controlled on   So.

In BCP.s II.1.3 and II.3.3 we have χ = T, i.e. whatever temperature is prescribed at the upper face, the temperature can be controlled on   So   by the electric potential difference between the two bounding planes.

Linear Piezothermoelasticity

Linear constitutive equations

The linear constitutive equations are specified below in terms of the constitutive coefficients:   cklij  =     elastic moduli;   eikl  =     piezoelectric moduli;   βkl  =     thermal stress moduli;   κEkl  =     dielectric susceptibility; [formula] pyroelectric polarizability; [formula] permittivity moduli;   κkl  =     Fourier coefficients;   γ  =     heat capacity;   ηo  =     entropy at the natural state;   ρo    =     mass-density at the natural state. These coefficients, each assumed to be constant, satisfy the following symmetry conditions:

[formula]

[formula]

With respect to a natural reference state, i.e., a state free from mechanical and/or electric fields, and with constant temperature θo, we assume the following standard constitutive equations [\cite=FVPL]-[\cite=Y:NET], [\cite=C:GSPT]), respectively for the stress tensor, electric displacement vector and heat flux vector:

[formula]

[formula]

where   Ei    =      -  φ,  i  ,   T = θ  -  θo   is the incremental absolute temperature with respect to the absolute temperature   θo   in the natural reference state.

Field equations of equilibrium

The linearized field equations of equilibrium, obtained by substituting the constitutive equations ([\ref=eq:ConstEquat1])-([\ref=eq:ConstEquat2DDDD]) in the balance laws ([\ref=eq:locEq]) taking   fk  =  ρe  =  γ = 0   are given by

[formula]

[formula]

Use of compressed notation and matrix arrays

As is well known, the matrix notation consists of replacing   ij   or   kl   by   p   or   q, where   i,  j,  k,  l   take the values   1,  2,  3   and   p,  q   take the values   1,  2,  3  ,4,  5,  6   according to the following relations:

By virtue of the above identification, the constitutive equations become

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula],   Sij    =    Sp  when  i = j = p = 1,  2,  3,   2Sij    =    Sp   i  ≠  j,  p = 4,  5,  6, and   eikl    =    eip.

Hexagonal materials

Constitutive equations for ferroelectric ceramics

The polarized ferroelectric ceramics have the symmetry of a hexagonal crystal in class   C6  ν = 6mm. Choosing   x3   in the polarization direction, assuming   βij    =    0   for   i  ≠  j   and putting

[formula]

the constitutive equations ([\ref=eq:ConstEquat1]) and ([\ref=eq:ConstEquat2DDDD])1 become (cf. e.g. [\cite=C:GSPT], [\cite=T:LPPV], and [\cite=FVPL])

[formula]

[formula]

Field equations of equilibrium

When the constitutive relations ([\ref=eqnarray:tttttt]), ([\ref=eqnarray:DDD]) are substituted in the equilibrium field equations ([\ref=eq:balance1bbb])-([\ref=eq:balance2bbb]) we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Particular forms of the solution to these equations are discussed in the next section, while general expressions are derived in the Appendix.

Quasi-statics

A principal application of the present theory is to a pyroelectric plate bonded to a fixed foundation, with the upper plane face exposed to sunlight. For this the boundary conditions include   (i) the prescription of temperature on the upper bounding plane, and   (ii) the condition of assigned displacement on the lower bounding plane. Furthermore, the prescribed boundary values may be understood to be functions of a parameter   τ   which depends slowly on time:

[formula]

Hence, we refer to equations ([\ref=eqnarray:ConstEq1111])-([\ref=eq:bal355]) augmented by these slowly varying boundary conditions as a boundary value problem of quasi-statics.

Boundary Control Problem  I.1.3

Statement of the problem

The plate   P   is bounded by the parallel planes   x1  =    ±  h   and is coated by an infinitesimally thin electrode on the plane   x1 = h, so that all its mechanical effects may be ignored. We seek solutions of the form

[formula]

which when substituted in ([\ref=eqnarray:ConstEq1111])-([\ref=eq:bal355]) give

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

BCP I.1.3:  To find the solution of the form ([\ref=eq:formsol]) to the field equations ([\ref=eq:ConstEq1111x])-([\ref=eq:ConstEq1444x]), subject to the ten boundary conditions

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula] assigned real constants.

General solution of BCP I.1.3

By Proposition [\ref=proposition:pr1], with

[formula]

[formula]

we have from ([\ref=eqnarray:SystemGenSol]) that the general solution to equations ([\ref=eq:ConstEq1333x])-([\ref=eq:ConstEq1444x]) is

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where   T1,  T2,  F1,  F2,  U31,  U32   are arbitrarily chosen smooth functions of   τ.

Further, ([\ref=eq:T1]) implies   T,  1 = T1aeax1 which together with ([\ref=eq:ConstEq1111x])1 yields

[formula]

while ([\ref=eq:ConstEq1111x])2 gives

[formula]

where   Uαβ,  α,  β = 1,  2, are arbitrary smooth functions of   τ.

Decomposition of   BCP  I.1.3

We solve   BCP  I.1.3 by decomposition into two parts, described below. Part 1 of BCP I.1.3.   We first consider the boundary conditions

[formula]

Note that by Eq.s ([\ref=eqnarray:DDD])1, ([\ref=eq:u3])-([\ref=eq:phi1]) and ([\ref=equation:a]), the 5-th boundary condition above becomes

[formula]

and by ([\ref=eq:ConstEquat3bis])2 the 6-th boundary condition above respectively

[formula]

Now ([\ref=eq:u3])-([\ref=eq:phi1]) satisfy ([\ref=eqnarray:6bc]) provided

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

By solving the above system of equations in the unknowns   (T1,  T2,  F1,  F2,  U3  1,  U3  2), we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

so that the solution to the first part of BCP I.1.3 becomes in particular

[formula]

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

[formula]

and for [formula] we have

[formula]

which yield electric potential and temperature in the plane   x1 =  - h   in terms of electric potential[formula] and temperature [formula] at   x1 = h.

Part 2 of BCP I.1.3.   Next, we use ([\ref=eq:TTFFBc]), ([\ref=eq:TTFFBct]) along with ([\ref=eq:u3]), ([\ref=eq:u1]), ([\ref=eq:u2]) and ([\ref=eqnarray:tttttt]) to determine the solution that satisfies the four remaining equations ([\ref=eq:ConstEq1111x]) joined to the four remaining boundary conditions

[formula]

Now by ([\ref=eqnarray:tttttt]) and ([\ref=eq:u1]) we have   t1  =  β1T1eah + c11U11  -  β1T   and   t6 = c66U21; hence by using ([\ref=eq:T1])-([\ref=eq:phi1]) the boundary conditions ([\ref=eq:bb1bx]) take the form

[formula]

[formula]

with   T1   given by ([\ref=equation:coeffPIB]). On solving ([\ref=eq:bc2part0])-([\ref=eq:bc2partx]) for   Uαβ   and substituting the resulting expressions in ([\ref=eq:u1]), ([\ref=eq:u2]) we are led to the complete solution of the second part of BCP I.1.3.

We point out that in order to avoid growth as   h  →    +    ∞     of the magnitude of the gradient

[formula]

of any solution [formula] to BCP I.1.3, we assume

[formula]

In fact, note that by the equalities above, if   a < 0, then   u1,  u3,  T,  φ    →    ∞     as   h  →    ∞  .

On controllability in BVP I.1.3

By Eq.s ([\ref=eq:TTFFBc]), ([\ref=eq:TTFFBct]) we can deduce the following control property.

Let    - h  ≤  x1  <  h. For each choice of [formula], given any three quantities in [formula], the remaining quantity can be choosen to control either   T(x1) or   φ(x1).

Problem BCP II.1.3

Statement of the problem

Here   P  , just as in BCP I.1.3, is bounded by the parallel planes   x1  =    ±  h   each coated by an electrode, which is infinitesimally thin, so that all mechanical effects may be ignored. We seek solutions of the form ([\ref=eq:formsol]) which when substituted in ([\ref=eqnarray:ConstEq1111])-([\ref=eq:bal355]) give again Eq.s ([\ref=eq:ConstEq1111x])-([\ref=eq:ConstEq1444x]).

BCP II.1.3:   To find the solution of the form ([\ref=eq:formsol]) to the field equations ([\ref=eq:ConstEq1111x])-([\ref=eq:ConstEq1444x]), which satisfies the ten boundary conditions

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula] assigned real constants.

General solution of BCP II.1.3

Insertion of ([\ref=eq:formsol]) into the equilibrium field equations ([\ref=eqnarray:ConstEq1111])-([\ref=eq:bal355]) gives Eq.s ([\ref=eq:ConstEq1111x])-([\ref=eq:ConstEq1444x]), whose general solution is expressed, as before, by Eq.s ([\ref=eq:u3])-([\ref=eq:phi1]), where

[formula]

are arbitrary smooth functions of   τ.

Decomposition of BCP   II.1.3

We solve BCP II.1.3 by separating it into two parts, described below. Part 1 of BCP II.1.3.   We first determine the arbitrary constants in the general solution ([\ref=eq:u3])-([\ref=eq:phi1]) so that the boundary conditions

[formula]

are satisfied. Note that by ([\ref=eq:ConstEquat3bis])2, ([\ref=eq:T1]) and ([\ref=eq:phi1]) the last boundary condition becomes

[formula]

We have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and by solving the above system of equations for the unknowns   (T1,  T2,  F1,  F2,  U3  1,  U3  2)   we find expressions for the latter in terms of the boundary data. In particular, we have

[formula]

[formula]

Hence, by ([\ref=eq:T1])-([\ref=eq:phi1]), the expressions of   T   and   φ   in terms of the boundary data are

[formula]

[formula]

from which we deduce

[formula]

Part 2 of BCP II.1.3.   The remaining two equations, together with the appropriate boundary conditions, exactly coincide with BCP I.1.3. Hence, we can proceed as described at the end of Subsection [\ref=subsubsection:SplittingProbB13].

In order to avoid growth as   h  →    +    ∞     of the magnitude of the solution, we again assume ([\ref=eq:assumption1]).

On controllability of temperature

By Eq. ([\ref=eq:C-1-3-coeff-sol2ex]) we can deduce the following control property.

Let    - h  ≤  x1  <  h. For each choice of [formula], given any three quantities from [formula], the remaining quantity can be choosen to control   T(x1). In particular, if [formula] and [formula] are assigned, then   T(x1)   is controllable by [formula].

BCP I.3.3, plate perpendicular to the polarization direction

Now consider a plate occupied by the same above material but having the polarization direction   x3   perpendicular to the plane of the plate. The plate is coated by an infinitesimally thin electrode on the plane   x3 = h, so that all its mechanical effects may be ignored. Solutions of the form

[formula]

satisfy ([\ref=eqnarray:ConstEq1111])-([\ref=eq:bal355]) provided

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

which are a system included in the general case considered in the Appendix.

BCP I.3.3:   To find the solution of the form ([\ref=eq:soloftheform3x3]) to the field equations ([\ref=eq:ConstEq1113+])-([\ref=eq:ConstEq11113+]), subject to the ten boundary conditions

[formula]

General solution of BCP I.3.3

In particular, on setting in ([\ref=eqnarray:systemgeneral])

[formula]

we obtain Eq.s ([\ref=eq:ConstEq1333333+])-([\ref=eq:ConstEq11113+]). Then by Proposition [\ref=proposition:pr1] the general solution to ([\ref=eq:ConstEq1333333+])-([\ref=eq:ConstEq11113+]) is

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where   T1,  T2,  F1,  F2,  Uα1,  Uα2    (α = 1,  2,  3)   are arbitrary smooth functions of   τ   and the notation ([\ref=eq:eewith]) and ([\ref=equation:a]) is used. Moreover, the constant   a, given by

[formula]

is supposed positive.

Decomposition of BCP I.3.3

We solve BCP I.3.3 by decomposing it into two parts. Part 1 of BCP I.3.3.   First, we note that Eq.s ([\ref=eqnarray:DDD])3, ([\ref=eq:u32])-([\ref=eq:phi12]) and ([\ref=equation:a]) imply

[formula]

and consequently, the solutions ([\ref=eq:u32])-([\ref=eq:phi12]) meet the boundary conditions ([\ref=eqnarray:6bc]) when

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

By solving the above system of equations in the unknowns   (T1,  T2,  F1,  F2,  U3  1,  U3  2), we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

which on substitution in the general solution ([\ref=eq:T12])-([\ref=eq:phi12]) yields the solution to the first part of BCP I.1.3. In particular, we have

[formula]

[formula]

and thus, by ([\ref=equation:coeffPIB+1]) too, we have

[formula]

[formula]

For [formula] we thus obtain

[formula]

which yields electric potential and temperature in the plane   x1 =  - h   in terms of electric potential and temperature [formula], [formula] at   x1 = h.

Part 2 of BCP I.3.3.   The remaining two equations ([\ref=eq:ConstEq1113+]), subject to the remaining four boundary conditions ([\ref=eq:bb1bx]), can be solved exactly as before in Subsection [\ref=subsubsection:SplittingProbB13].

We point out that in order to avoid growth as   h  →    +    ∞     of the magnitude of the gradient

[formula]

of any solution [formula] to BCP I.1.3, we assume

[formula]

On controllability in BCP I.3.3

By Eq.s ([\ref=eq:TTFFB+]), ([\ref=eq:TTFFBt+]) we can deduce the following control property.

Let    - h  ≤  x3  <  h. For each choice of [formula] and [formula], given any three quantities from [formula], the fourth quantity can be choosen to control either   T(x3)   or   φ(x3).

BCP II.3.3, plate perpendicular to the polarization direction

Here   P   (see BCP I.3.3) is bounded by the parallel planes   x3  =    ±  h   on which are coated two infinitesimally thin electrodes whose mechanical effects therefore may be ignored. We seek solutions of the form ([\ref=eq:soloftheform3x3]) which after substitution in ([\ref=eqnarray:ConstEq1111])-([\ref=eq:bal355]) give Eq.s ([\ref=eq:ConstEq1113+])-([\ref=eq:ConstEq11113+]).

BCP II.3.3  :   To find the solution of the form ([\ref=eq:soloftheform3x3]) to the field equations ([\ref=eq:ConstEq1113+])-([\ref=eq:ConstEq11113+]), which satisfies the ten boundary conditions

[formula]

General solution of BCP II.3.3

The equations correspponding to ([\ref=eq:ConstEq1113+])-([\ref=eq:ConstEq11113+]) are of the form ([\ref=eqnarray:systemgeneral]) on setting

[formula]

so that by Proposition [\ref=proposition:pr1] the general solution to Eq.s ([\ref=eq:ConstEq1113+])-([\ref=eq:ConstEq11113+]) is given by Eq.s ([\ref=eq:u12])-([\ref=eq:phi12]), where

[formula]

are arbitrary smooth functions of   τ   and we adopt the notation defined in Eq.s ([\ref=eq:eewith]), ([\ref=equation:a]).

Decomposition of BCP II.3.3

We solve BCP II.3.3 as follows:

Part 1 of BCP II.3.3.   The general solution ([\ref=eq:u32])-([\ref=eq:phi12]) to Eq.s ([\ref=eq:ConstEq1333333+])-([\ref=eq:ConstEq11113+]) satisfies the six boundary conditions

[formula]

provided that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

which can be solved for the unknowns

[formula]

to give in particular the expressions

[formula]

and ([\ref=eq:C-1-3-coeff-solT1T2])2, ([\ref=eq:C-1-3-coeff-sol3]). Hence, ([\ref=eq:T12]) and ([\ref=eq:phi12]) become

[formula]

[formula]

and we conclude that

[formula]

Part 2 of BCP II.3.3.   The remaining two equations, subject to the appropriate boundary conditions, exactly coincide with the corresponding equations of BCP I.3.3. Hence we can solve them by the method of Subsection [\ref=subsubsection:SplittingProbB13].

In order to avoid growth as   h  →    +    ∞     in the magnitude of the gradient of the solution, we assume ([\ref=eq:assumption2b]).

On controllability of temperature

By Eq. ([\ref=eq:C-1-3-coeff-sol23]) we can deduce the following control property.

Let    - h  ≤  x3  <  h. For each choice of [formula] and [formula], given any three quantities from [formula], the remaining quantity can be choosen to control   T(x3). In particular, when [formula] are assigned,   T(x3)   is controllable by [formula].

Conclusions and perspectives

We have shown that, for a piezothermoelastic plate referred to a natural configuration, in the presence of a quasi-static incremental temperature given on one of its bounding faces, on the other bounding face either the electric potential or the temperature can be controlled by certain boundary data.

An aim of a future investigation could be to examine how these result generalize when the initial configuration of the plate is not a natural configuration, that is, when there is some initial mechanical, thermal and/or electric field.

Appendix

The following elementary result on first order differential equations is used.

If   f = f(x)   is a scalar function of the real variable   x   and   a,  b∈I  R, then the general solution of the linear first-order differential equation

[formula]

is   f  =  γeax + b, where   γ   is an arbitrary real constant.

Let   c,  e,  e',  β,  ω,  ε,  k,  k'   be real scalars. Then the system of linear differential equations

[formula]

in the unknown scalar functions

[formula]

of the real variable   x, has the general solution

[formula]

where

[formula]

are arbitrary and

[formula]

Proof.    Equation ([\ref=eqnarray:systemgeneral])3 yields   φ,  xx = KT,  xx, thus

[formula]

and Eq.s ([\ref=eqnarray:systemgeneral])1,  2 become

[formula]

By eliminating   u,  xx   from these two equalities, we obtain the second-order equation

[formula]

with   a   defined in ([\ref=equation:a]); consequently   T,  x = a(T - T2)   where   T2   is an arbitrary constant. By Remark [\ref=remark:uno] the latter equation has the general solution

[formula]

which by substitution in ([\ref=equation:ff]) enables us to conclude that ([\ref=eqnarray:SystemGenSol])2 holds. Lastly, insertion of the expressions for   T   and   φ   into ([\ref=eqnarray:sg2])1 yields   u,  xx = c- 1T1Vaeax   where   V: = β - Ke'a. Hence by integration we obtain   u,  x = c- 1T1Veax + U1, which yields ([\ref=eqnarray:SystemGenSol])3. [formula]
