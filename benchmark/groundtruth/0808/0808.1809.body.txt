Observation of an Orbital Selective Electron-Mode Coupling in Fe-Based High-Tc Superconductors

The recent discovery of Fe-based superconductors with critical temperatures up to 56 K [\cite=Kamihara] [\cite=Takahashi] [\cite=Wen] [\cite=XH_Chen] [\cite=GF_Chen] [\cite=Ren] raises the prospect of unconventional superconducting pairing mechanism. While the electronic pairing in conventional superconductors is mediated by lattice vibration modes (phonons), its nature in the Fe-based high-Tc superconductors is unknown. Similarly to copper oxides (cuprates), these materials exhibit anomalously large 2Δ / kBTc ratios [\cite=Ding_EPL] and are close to antiferromagnetic instabilities. However, they differ from the copper oxides by the symmetry of the order parameter, which is s-wavelike rather than d-wave [\cite=Ding_EPL]. Whether superconductivity in these materials can be driven by phonons or not is under intense debate and it is of crucial importance to identify signatures of the pairing mechanism itself.

The many-body interactions responsible for superconductivity are closely related to the electronic energy dispersion and other excitations in the vicinity of the Fermi level (EF). Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a powerful technique to directly access the electronic dispersion of materials and its interactions with bosonic excitations. Indeed, a direct signature of an electron-mode coupling is an anomaly in the electronic energy dispersion (kink). For example, previous ARPES studies revealed a kink in cuprates [\cite=Norman1] [\cite=Valla1] [\cite=Kaminski1] [\cite=Lanzara1], which is believed to be linked to the pairing.

We searched anomalies in the low energy scale of the electronic dispersion of Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 single-crystals (Tc = 37 K) by performing high-resolution ARPES measurements. In this Letter, we report the observation of a kink around 25 meV. Similarly to the antinodal kink observed in cuprates [\cite=Norman1] [\cite=Kaminski1], the kink in Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 nearly vanishes above Tc. In addition to the energy scale of the related energy mode (13±  2 meV), the kink has a strong dependence on orbital and temperature that suggests a non-phononic origin. Furthermore, the observation of the kink only on two Fermi surface (FS) sheets connected by the antiferromagnetic vector [formula] point towards an electronic origin and strongly support the anti-phase s-wave pairing symmetry.

High-quality single crystals of Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 (Tc = 37 K) have been grown using the flux method [\cite=GF_Chen2]. A microwave-driven helium source (hν = 21.218 eV and 40.814 eV) and a VG-Scienta 2002 multi-channel analyzer were used to record ARPES spectra with energy and momentum resolutions of 4-7 meV and 0.007-0.01 Å- 1, respectively. The samples were cleaved in-situ at 15 K and measured with working vacuum better than 5×  10- 11 Torr. No obvious degradation of the spectra was observed for typical measurements of 3 days.

In contrast to copper oxides, the iron-based superconductors (ferropnictides) have a complex FS [\cite=Ding_EPL] [\cite=Lu] [\cite=Liu] with at least three bands crossing EF, called α, β and γ, respectively [\cite=Ding_EPL]. We first focus on the inner holelike band centered at the Γ point, named α, which has a 12 meV superconducting gap [\cite=Ding_EPL]. Figure [\ref=fig_alpha] summarizes the results obtained at 15 K along a cut in momentum space indicated in the inset of Fig. [\ref=fig_alpha](a). The ARPES intensity plot displayed in panel (a) shows a clear discontinuity in the electronic dispersion around 25 meV. This anomaly is emphasized in the corresponding energy distribution curves (EDCs) shown in Fig. [\ref=fig_alpha](b), which represent the photoemission intensity as a function of binding energy at a fixed momentum. The sharpness of the peaks suggests a very good sample quality. We find a dip in the EDCs whose energy is always fixed around 25 meV, characteristic signature of an electron-mode coupling. Figure [\ref=fig_alpha](c) shows the plots of photoemission intensity at 15 K as a function of momentum at a fixed energy, commonly called momentum distribution curves (MDCs).

In the presence of many-body interactions, an electron-mode coupling is usually described by a complex self-energy Σ(ω). Following a common practice in ARPES [\cite=Johnson], we approximated the real part of Σ(ω) induced by the coupling by the difference between the MDC dispersions obtained at 15 K and 150 K, the latter used as an approximation of the "bare" band dispersion without electron-mode coupling. The intensity plot of the 150 K data used for the extraction of Σ(ω) is given in Fig. [\ref=fig_alpha](d). The data at 150 K have been normalized between -40 and 150 meV after division by the Fermi-Dirac function in order to minimize the effect of photoemission matrix element suppression at the Γ point and facilitate the visualization of the band above EF. Our approach is justified by the absence of kink and energy gap at 150 K. Moreover, the anomaly is observed in the partial density of states (DOS) at 15 K obtained by integrating the EDCs over a wide momentum range along the measured cut, while it is completely absent at 150 K (inset of Fig. [\ref=fig_alpha](e). In addition, the thermal broadening of the Fermi cutoff at 150 K allows us to determine that the α band tops at 20 meV above EF. The imaginary part of Σ(ω) is approximated by the half-width at half-maximum of the Lorenztian functions used to fit the MDCs, multiplied by the velocity of the bare band at each energy ω. The results of the self-energy analysis are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig_alpha](e). Both the real and imaginary parts of Σ(ω) exhibit a well defined anomaly at a position similar to the dip, as expected in the presence of an electron-mode coupling. Particularly, the drop in the absolute value of the imaginary part of Σ(ω) indicates a reduced quasiparticle scattering rate. In simple models, a coupling with an Einstein mode of energy Ω in the presence of a superconducting gap Δ will be observed at a binding energy Ω  +  Δ [\cite=Norman2]. Subtracting the 12 meV superconducting gap of the α band [\cite=Ding_EPL] from the anomaly energy, we assign to the mode an energy of Ω = 13 ±   2 meV.

We now address the important question of the orbital dependence of the dispersion anomaly. In order to investigate this issue, we measured ARPES spectra along a cut crossing the β FS (outer holelike FS centred at the Γ point). The corresponding ARPES intensity plot and EDCs are given in Fig. [\ref=orbital_dep](a) and Fig. [\ref=orbital_dep](b), respectively, and the location of the cut in momentum space is indicated in Fig. [\ref=orbital_dep](c). Surprisingly, the β band exhibits a kink neither at 25 meV nor at Δβ+Ω = 19 meV, where Δβ = 6 meV [\cite=Ding_EPL]. The partial DOS around the β band Fermi wavevector supports this observation, in contrast to the α and γ bands, which both show a dip around 25 meV in the partial DOS (Fig. [\ref=orbital_dep](d)). This behavior is not simply explained by a conventional isotropic electron-phonon coupling and suggests the orbital selective nature of the mode. The mode is preferentially coupled to the electrons in the α and γ bands, which are well connected via the antiferromagnetic (AF) momentum transfer [formula] = (π, 0), here expressed in the unreconstructed Brillouin zone (BZ), or (π, π) in the reconstructed BZ. We illustrate this scenario in Fig. [\ref=orbital_dep](c) and stress that a less than perfect nesting is compensated, in the presence of inelastic scattering, by the flatness and shallowness of the γ band [\cite=Ding_EPL].

To characterize further the kink in the dispersion, we performed a temperature dependence of the ARPES measurements associated with the α band. The results are summarized in Fig. [\ref=temperature_dep]. In panel (a), we show the spectra obtained at 50 K. The 50 K data (normal state) differ from the 15 K ones not only by the absence of a superconducting gap, but also by a marked suppression of the kink, suggesting a strong correlation between the electron-mode coupling and the superconducting state. The suppression of the kink is also clearly seen in Fig. [\ref=temperature_dep](b), where we overlap the dispersion extracted from the MDC analysis at 15 K and 50 K. The temperature dependence of Re Σ(ω) is given in Fig. [\ref=temperature_dep](c). The peak in Re Σ(ω) characterizing the kink is strongly suppressed with temperature and nearly vanishes above Tc. Similarly, the maximum value of Re Σ(ω), which is given in Fig. [\ref=temperature_dep](d), has a strong temperature dependence and tends to disappear above Tc (T = 50 K).

Calculations suggest that the Fe contribution to the phonon DOS in LaFeAsO1 - xFx has a peak centered at 12 meV [\cite=Singh] [\cite=Boeri], close to the value found experimentally by inelastic neutron scattering on the same compound [\cite=Christianson_DOS]. However, besides the unusual orbital dependence of the kink, the phononic nature of the mode would not be able to explain satisfactorily at least two other points: 1) unlike the ARPES kink, the experimental phonon DOS does not show any strong temperature dependence [\cite=Christianson_DOS]; 2) the predicted coupling strength λ  ≈  0.21 is too small [\cite=Singh] [\cite=Boeri] to explain the present ARPES results and the optical measurements [\cite=Yang].

A more natural explanation is that the mode has an electronic origin. It has been suggested, especially from the orbital dependence of the superconducting gap [\cite=Ding_EPL], that pairing in the ferropnictides is favored by the nesting of the α and γ bands, centered respectively at the Γ and M points [\cite=Mazin] [\cite=Kuroki] [\cite=Wang]. They have almost same gap magnitude, which is twice as much as the gap observed for the β band [\cite=Ding_EPL]. Interestingly, a recent inelastic neutron scattering study of Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 revealed a spin resonance centered around 14 meV at the AF wavevector [\cite=Christianson]. As shown in Fig. [\ref=temperature_dep](d), the temperature dependence of the corresponding neutron scattering intensity agrees remarkably well with our result for the maximum value of Re Σ(ω), pointing towards a same origin. Indeed, the opening of a superconducting gap Δ in the strong coupling regime is naturally accompanied by the opening of an energy gap in the electronic spin excitations, which can give rise to a resonance mode due to divergence in the magnetic spin susceptibility (resonance mode) [\cite=Chubukov] [\cite=Korshunov] [\cite=Maier]. In the presence of such a feedback process, induced kinks in the dispersion are expected around 2Δ, in agreement with our result for the α and γ bands. Within our resolution, no obvious kink is found for the β band at 2Δ (12 meV), suggesting the possible orbital selectivity of the feedback process. We caution that a kink may also be induced by band folding (α  ↔  γ) resulting from the enhanced AF fluctuations below Tc, in which case the kink would be better described in terms of hybridization. In any of these scenarios though, or even in a combination of them, the kink keeps a purely electronic origin.

At this point it is interesting to compare the kink reported in this letter with the kink observed in the cuprates. While phonons have been proposed to explain this feature [\cite=Lanzara1], some experiments and calculations contradict this hypothesis [\cite=Norman1] [\cite=Johnson] [\cite=Terashima] [\cite=Giustino] and the nature of the kink in cuprates remains an open question. Although a one-to-one correspondence between the Fe-based and Cu-based superconductors is not expected, the kinks observed in the two families of compounds behave similarly: both are observed at an energy close to 2Δ at locations that can be linked by an AF wavevector, in addition to have a strong temperature dependence and disappear above Tc. It is therefore tempting to assume that they also share the same origin. More significantly, the emergence of an AF resonance mode has been intimately associated with the opposite pairing phases between the connected FS sections in both cuprates [\cite=Chubukov] and Fe-based superconductors [\cite=Korshunov] [\cite=Maier]. Thus, the observation of an orbital-selective mode coupling strongly supports the idea of antiphase s-wave pairing in the new high-Tc superconductors.

In summary, we found a kink around 25 meV in the electronic energy dispersion of the new superconductor Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 that we assign to a mode of energy 13 ±   2 meV. The mode nearly vanishes above Tc and is observed only on the α and γ FS, which are well connected by the antiferromagnetic wavevector. These observations of a non-ubiquitous kink with strong temperature dependence strongly suggest an unconventional mechanism for the mode of purely electronic origin.
