The Exceptionally Luminous Type II-Linear Supernova 2008es

Introduction

Wide-field synoptic optical imaging surveys are continuing to probe the parameter space of time-variable phenomena with increasing depth and temporal coverage [\citep=2004ApJ...611..418B] [\citep=2006MNRAS.371.1681M] [\citep=2008MNRAS.386..887B], unveiling a variety of transients ranging from the common [\citep=2008ApJ...682.1205R] to the unexplained (e.g., [\citealt=bdt+08]). Untargeted ("blind") synoptic wide-field imaging surveys, such as the Texas Supernova Search (TSS; [\citealt=quimbyTSS]) conducted with the ROTSE-III 0.45-m telescope [\citep=akerlof03], have uncovered a large number of rare transients, including the four most luminous supernovae (SNe) observed to date: SN 2005ap [\citep=quimby05ap], SN 2008am [\citep=ATEL.1389], SN 2006gy [\citep=ofek06gy] [\citep=smith07-2006gy] [\citep=smith08-2006gy], and SN 2006tf [\citep=smith06tf]. Observations of these very luminous events are starting to allow the detailed physical study of the extrema in core-collapse SNe. They appear to be powered in part by their interaction with a highly dense circumstellar medium (CSM; see [\citealt=smith06tf], and references therein), though other possibilities have been advanced. Clearly, the discovery of more such events would allow an exploration of the variety of the phenomenology as related to the diversity of progenitors and CSM.

Recently, the TSS discovered yet another luminous transient on 2008 Apr. 26.23 (UT dates are used throughout this paper), which they suggested was a variable active galactic nucleus at a redshift z  =  1.02 [\citep=ATEL.1515]. [\citet=ATEL.1524] then hypothesized that the transient was a flare from the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. [\citet=ATEL.1576] first identified SN 2008es as potentially an extremely luminous Type II SN (see also [\citealt=2008ATel.1578....1G]), and we later definitively confirmed this with further spectroscopic observations [\citep=ATEL.1644]; the event was assigned the name SN 2008es by the IAU [\citep=2008CBET.1462....1C]. It is located at α = 11h56m49.06s, δ = +54o27[formula]24.77[formula] (J2000.0).

Here we present our analysis of SN 2008es, which is classified as a Type II-Linear (II-L) SN based on the observed linear (in mag) decline in the photometric light curve [\citep=barbon79] [\citep=doggett85]. At z = 0.213, SN 2008es has a peak optical magnitude of MV  =   - 22.3, among SNe second only to SN 2005ap. Aside from the extreme luminosity, SN 2008es is of great interest since detailed ultraviolet (UV) through infrared (IR) observations provide a unique opportunity to study the mass-loss properties of an evolved post-main sequence massive star via its interaction with the surrounding dense CSM. A similar analysis of SN 2008es has been presented by [\citet=gezari08].

The outline of this paper is as follows. We present our observations in §2, and the photometric and spectroscopic analyses of this and public (NASA) data in §3 and §4, respectively. A discussion is given in §5, and our conclusions are summarized in §6. Throughout this paper we adopt a concordance cosmology of H0 = 70 km s- 1 Mpc- 1, ΩM  =  0.3, and ΩΛ  =  0.7.

Observations

Here we present our ground-based optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry and optical spectroscopy, along with space-based Swift UV, optical, and X-ray observations. NIR photometry of SN 2008es was obtained simultaneously in J, H, and Ks with the Peters Automated Infrared Imaging Telescope (PAIRITEL; [\citealt=bloom06]) beginning 2008 May 16. To improve the photometric signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), we stacked images over multiple nights. For the Ks images the S/N of the SN remained low, despite the stacks made over multiple epochs, and therefore we do not include these data in our subsequent analysis. Aperture photometry, using a custom pipeline, was used to measure the J and H photometry of the isolated SN calibrated to the 2MASS catalog (see [\citealt=bloom080319b]). The resulting light curves are presented in Figure [\ref=ourphot]. The final PAIRITEL photometry is reported in Table [\ref=tbl-pairitel].

Optical photometry of SN 2008es was obtained in  with the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT; [\citealt=filippenkoLOSS]) and the 1-m Nickel telescope at Lick Observatory beginning 2008 May 30. Point-spread function (PSF)-fitting photometry was performed on the SN and several comparison stars using the IRAF/DAOPHOT package [\citep=1987PASP...99..191S:stetson] and transformed into the Johnson-Cousins system. Calibrations for the field were obtained with the Nickel telescope on three photometric nights. The final photometry from KAIT and the Nickel telescope is given in Tables [\ref=tbl-kait] and [\ref=tbl-nickel], respectively.

Additional optical photometry was obtained in U on 2008 June 02 and  on 2008 Aug. 05 with PFCam on the 3-m Shane telescope at Lick Observatory. The data were reduced using standard techniques and aperture photometry was used to extract the SN flux.  calibrations were done using the same stars as those used for the Nickel and KAIT observations. Calibrations for the U band were not obtained with the Nickel telescope. Therefore, we convert the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) colors of stars in the field to the U band with the color transformations of [\citet=jester2005], and use these stars for our U-band calibration. The final PFCam photometry is reported in Table [\ref=tbl-pfcam].

The Swift satellite observed SN 2008es during 13 epochs between 2008 May 14 and Aug. 21. We downloaded the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT; [\citealt=roming05]) data from the Swift data archive and analyzed the Level 2 sky image data in U, B, and V according to the photometry calibration and recipe by [\citet=li06]. The Swift UV filters (UVW1, UVM1, and UVW2) were reduced following [\citet=poole2008]. The final Swift UVOT photometry is reported in Table [\ref=tbl-uvot].

Simultaneous observations of SN 2008es occurred with the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT; [\citealt=burrows05]), for which we confirm a nondetection of X-ray emission (see also [\citealt=ATEL.1524]). To place a limit on the source flux we assume a power-law spectrum with a photon index Γ  =  2, absorbed by elements associated with Galactic . We took an extraction region of radius 64 pixels (~  2.5[formula]) and fit the PSF model around the centroid of the optical emission. We obtain a 3σ limiting flux of 9  ×  10- 15 erg cm- 2 s- 1 in the 0.3-10 keV band for a total exposure of 54.7 ks. This represents an upper limit to the X-ray luminosity of SN 2008es of ~  1.2  ×  1042 ergs s- 1.

We obtained spectra of SN 2008es on 2008 May 16.3, 2008 May 29.3, and 2008 July 7.3 using the Kast spectrograph on the Lick 3-m telescope [\citep=kastref]. Additional spectra were obtained on 2008 June 7.4 and 2008 Aug. 3.3 using the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer on the Keck I 10-m telescope [\citep=oke95] and on 2008 June 21.2 and 2008 June 23.2 using the R. C. Spectrograph on the Kitt Peak 4-m telescope, following the approval of our request for Kitt Peak Director's Discretionary Time. The spectra were extracted and calibrated following standard procedures (e.g., [\citealt=matheson00]). Clouds were present during several of the observations, making the absolute flux scales unreliable. The spectrograph slit was placed at the parallactic angle, so the relative spectral shapes should be accurate [\citep=fil82], with the exception of the Kitt Peak spectra, which have a small amount of second-order light contamination at wavelengths longward of ~  8000 Å. The full SN 2008es spectral sequence is plotted in Figure [\ref=specevo]. The two Kitt Peak spectra show little evolution in the two days that separate them and have been combined to increase the S/N (day 33 in Figure [\ref=specevo]). A log of our spectroscopic observations is presented in Table [\ref=specobstab].

We searched our spectra for the possible presence of narrow lines and were unable to positively identify any, either in emission or absorption. Therefore, without a detection of the host galaxy, we determine the redshift of SN 2008es directly from the SN spectrum. As the SN aged, broad P-Cygni spectral features appeared, including an emission feature near 7900 Å that we identify as Hα near a redshift of 0.2. Other spectral features are consistent with a Type II SN at about that redshift.

To get a more accurate redshift, we identified two similar reference spectra of the Type II-L SNe 1979C and 1980K from the literature [\citep=branch81] [\citep=uomoto86]. These spectral comparisons are shown in the bottom panel of Figure [\ref=speccomp]. We used the SuperNova IDentification code of [\citet=snid07] to cross-correlate the day 68 spectrum of SN 2008es with the two reference spectra and derived a weighted-average z  =  0.213  ±  0.006, which we adopt throughout this paper. This redshift agrees with a fit to the broad Hα emission line in the day 68 spectrum, which yields a flux centroid of z  =  0.210. The SN 2008es redshift determined using this method is correlated with the expansion velocity, but we assume that the bias due to this effect is small given that all three SNe have Hα emission lines of a similar width at late times.

Photometric Results

Our dataset provides excellent broad-band coverage of SN 2008es from the UV to the NIR, which allows us to model changes in the spectral energy distribution (SED). In order to sample each photometric band onto a single set of common epochs, we fit low-order polynomials to each light curve, which we then interpolate onto a common grid. NIR observations were only included on or around epochs where we detected the SN.

We create an SED at each of the common epochs and fit a single-component blackbody (BB) to the data following the procedure described by [\citet=modjaz08d]. Prior to the SED/BB fits we add a systematic term to the uncertainty in the photometric measurement in each band. This term is added in quadrature to the statistical uncertainty, and for the NIR ( JH) is equal to 2%, in the optical () we adopt 3%, while for U band we adopt 10%, and the adopted UV (UVW1, UVM2, UVW2) systematic uncertainty is 20%. Across all epochs of the BB fits the total χ2 per degree of freedom is 45.6 / 65, which suggests that our systematic terms may be slightly overestimated. We assume no host-galaxy extinction (for further details see §5), and correct our measurements for the modest amount of Galactic reddening E(B - V) = 0.011 mag [\citep=schlegel98]. From the SED/BB fits we derive the temperature, radius, and luminosity of the SN as a function of time, as shown in Figure [\ref=bol_lum]. The temperature and luminosity decrease while the radius increases with time, as expected for an expanding and cooling SN photosphere.

In order to determine the time of V-band maximum light, which at the redshift of this SN roughly corresponds to rest-frame B, we convert the early time g, r, and i' photometry taken with the Palomar 1.5-m telescope from [\citet=gezari08] to VRI using the color equations from [\citet=jester2005]. Following a quadratic fit to these data, we find that the observed V-band maximum occurred on ~  2008 May 13, ~  15 rest-frame days after discovery. The observed peak is V = 17.8 mag, which corresponds to MV = - 22.3 mag, with a scatter about our fit of 0.04 mag.

In Figure [\ref=SED] we show two representative fits to the SED of SN 2008es  at 26.6 and 65.4 rest-frame days after discovery. In all epochs we observe excess emission relative to a single BB in the bluest of the Swift filters, UVW2, while starting around 55 rest-frame days after discovery there is excess emission in both UVW2 and UVM2. This excess was also observed in the Type II-Plateau (II-P) SN 2006bp, where it was attributed to complex line blanketing by Fe-peak elements [\citep=immler07]. The blue excess is readily identified in the UV color curves (e.g., UVW2-UVW1) of SN 2008es, which evolve toward the red until ~  50 rest-frame days after discovery, at which point the UVW2-UVW1 and UVM2-UVW1 colors become progressively more and more blue. These points were excluded from our SED/BB fits. To confirm that we were not underestimating the bolometric luminosity of the SN, we directly integrated the flux in the SED using the same method as [\citet=modjaz08d]. We show the results of this direct integration in the lower panel of Figure [\ref=bol_lum], and in all cases we find that the BB model and direct integration method agree to within [formula]20%.

The observed linear decline in the light curve of SN 2008es leads us to classify it as a Type II-L SN. We measure a bolometric photometric decay rate of 0.042 mag d- 1, which is slightly faster than the V-band (roughly rest-frame B) rate of 0.036 mag d- 1. This rate is also slightly slower than the rest-frame B-band decay of both SN 1979C (0.046 mag d- 1; [\citealt=panagia1980]) and SN 1980K (0.055 mag d- 1; [\citealt=barbon82]). Furthermore, integrating the bolometric light curve from 15 to 83 rest-frame days after discovery yields a total radiated energy of ~  9 ×  1050 ergs, comparable to the canonical 1051 ergs deposited into the kinetic energy of a SN. If we assume the same bolometric correction factor to the observed V-band light curve both pre- and post-maximum, and we include the early data from [\citet=gezari08], we find the total radiated energy of SN 2008es over the first 83 d after discovery is ~  1.1 ×  1051 ergs.

The three Swift UVOT observations taken more than 80 d after the discovery of SN 2008es show tentative evidence for a significant reduction in the SN photometric decline rate (see Figure [\ref=ourphot]). We note, however, that the late-time UVOT measurements have significant errors, and these observations may be consistent with the early trend seen in the light curve. [\citet=gezari08] suggested that these observations were evidence that the SN luminosity made a transition to being powered by radioactive heating from 56Co. With only two observations of this decline, we caution against prematurely identifying the 56Co decay tail, and instead argue that the observations are inconclusive at this time. For instance, it would be possible to mimic the behavior of 56Co decay with a late-time light echo, or interaction with an extended CSM. We note that SN 2006gy also showed evidence for a "flattening" several months after explosion [\citep=smith07-2006gy], but further observations taken the following year indicated that this was not clearly the 56Co tail [\citep=smith08-2006gy]. Our last optical spectrum (Fig. [\ref=specevo]) also shows no evidence that the ejecta were becoming optically thin on that date, as would be expected if SN 2008es were transitioning to the radioactive decay tail. Late-time photometry will be necessary to conclusively identify if and when the light curve of SN 2008es made a transition to being powered by 56Co decay, and thus allow a measurement of the amount of 56Ni synthesized in the explosion.

Spectroscopy

The SN 2008es spectral sequence plotted in Figure [\ref=specevo] is labeled with ages (in the rest frame) relative to the observed V-band maximum in order to facilitate comparison with SNe 1979C and 1980K in Figure [\ref=speccomp]. Our first two spectra of SN 2008es (at + 3 and + 13 d relative to maximum light) show a smooth and featureless blue continuum with no identifiable spectral features. In particular, we do not detect an emission feature near 5650 Å (4660 Å in the rest frame) seen in earlier spectra of SN 2008es taken between 2008 May 1 and 2008 May 8 [\citep=ATEL.1515] [\citep=gezari08]. [\citet=gezari08] attribute this feature solely to λ4686, but we note that transient emission features seen in the early spectra of some SNe IIn at similar wavelengths are due to a combination of λ4686 and the Wolf-Rayet / λ4640 blend [\citep=niemela85] [\citep=leonard00].

In addition, the spectrum of the extremely luminous SN 2005ap from - 3 d is shown at the top of Figure [\ref=specevo]. The SN 2005ap spectrum is also very blue, but has additional spectral features that are not seen in our SN 2008es spectrum from a similar epoch. [\citet=quimby05ap] identified the strongest spectral feature in SN 2005ap, the "W"-shaped feature near 4200 Å, as being due to a blend of , , and with an expansion velocity of about 20,000 km s- 1.

Our next spectrum, at +  21 d, is noticeably redder and is the first to show strong spectral features. Both SN 1979C at a similar epoch and SN 2008es show a blue continuum with weak, low-contrast lines of H and lines present mostly in absorption (Fig. [\ref=speccomp]). However, Hα is present only in emission and is weak in SN 2008es. The Hα line in SN 2008es has a full width at half-maximum intensity (FWHM) of 10,000 km s- 1 and an equivalent width of only 22 Å. (Both of these values have large uncertainties due to difficulties in defining the continuum for a line with such a low amplitude.) One difference between the two objects is the lower apparent velocities in SN 2008es. The Hβ and λ5876 lines of SN 1979C have absorption minima at velocities of 9700 and 8900 km s- 1. In SN 2008es, these values are 6000 and 5700 km s- 1, respectively, although we caution that the exact values are correlated with the assumed value for the redshift.

Over the next two months, the spectra of SN 2008es plotted in Figure [\ref=specevo] became redder, reflecting the cooling photospheric temperature evolution discussed above. In addition, the spectral features first seen in the day +21 spectrum gradually became more prominent. The SN features are still muted in amplitude relative to those expected in a normal Type II SN. This may be an example of the "top-lighting" effect described by [\citet=branch00], where continuum emission from interaction with CSM illuminates the SN ejecta from above and results in a rescaling of the amplitudes of spectral features.

By the time of our day +68 spectrum, the P-Cygni spectral features due to H Balmer lines, , and become more prominent and the overall appearance starts to resemble that of normal SNe II. The Hα profile lacks an absorption component, which may be common to SNe II-L and not SNe II-P (e.g., [\citealt=schlegel96], [\citealt=fil97]). The broad Hα emission extends (at zero intensity) from - 9000 to 9000 km s- 1, with a FWHM of 9500 km s- 1. This velocity width is intermediate between that of the SNe 1979C and 1980K spectra (FWHM ≈   10,600 and ≈   8200 km s- 1, respectively).

Unlike in most core-collapse SNe, the velocity of the minimum of the Hβ line increased over time, from 6000 km s- 1 at day 21, to 8700 km s- 1 at day 68, as shown in the bottom panel of Figure [\ref=velplot]. The exact values of the velocity depend directly on the assumed redshift, but the trend is independent of those uncertainties. Unfortunately, the other absorption lines are mostly blended (except for Hα, which does not show an absorption component), so we cannot isolate the velocity trend in other spectral features without spectral modeling. The top panel of Figure [\ref=velplot] shows the evolution of the λ5876/ λ5892 blend. At early times dominates the blend, and as the ejecta cool at later epochs should dominate, resulting in an ~  800 km s- 1 redward shift of the rest wavelength. After taking into account that redward shift, the top panel of Figure [\ref=velplot] also shows some weak evidence for a blueward shift of the absorption minimum to ~  8000 km s- 1.

The only supernova known to us to show increasing absorption velocities over time is the peculiar SN Ib 2005bf. The trend of increasing absorption velocities was only visible in the three He I lines, but not in other lines such as Ca II H&K [\citep=modjaz07_thesis]. [\citet=tominaga05bf] explained the effect as being due to progressive outward excitation of by radioactive 56Ni in the interior as the ejecta expanded and the density decreased, an effect that seems to be of little relevance to SN 2008es. A more likely possibility is that blending with some unidentified line is shifting the velocity of the apparent absorption minimum. At late times Hβ dominates its region of the spectrum, but at early times λ4686 could possibly be contributing emission to the blue wing of the Hβ absorption profile. Another scenario is that some unusual, but as yet unidentified, radiative transfer effect is affecting the wavelength of the apparent absorption minimum in SN 2008es. For example, if the optical depth in an optically thick line increases sufficiently rapidly with time (e.g., as the ejecta cool and recombine), then the apparent absorption minimum could move blueward [\citep=jb90]. None of these suggestions explain why such an effect would be present only in SN 2008es and not in normal SNe.

Discussion

The Physical Nature of SN 2008es

The photometric evolution of SN 2008es (see Fig. [\ref=photcomp]) is much faster than that of other very luminous SNe like SNe 2006gy [\citep=smith07-2006gy] [\citep=ofek06gy], 2006tf [\citep=smith06tf], and 2005gj [\citep=prieto05gj], and its spectrum also betrays no evidence for the strong CSM interaction seen in these other SNe IIn, in the form of narrow lines from the CSM or intermediate-width Hα from the post-shock shell. Indeed, considering both its photometric and spectroscopic evolution, we suggest that SN 2008es is most like the overluminous SN 2005ap [\citep=quimby05ap] and thereby most closely resembles a Type II-L that is 4-5 mag more luminous than typical SNe II-L [\citep=richardson02].

To power the tremendous luminosity of SN 2008es with radioactive decay would require an initial 56Ni mass of ~  10 M[formula] (see, e.g., [\citealt=smith07-2006gy]). This 56Ni mass would very likely need to be generated in a pair-instability explosion ([\citealt=barkat67] [\citealt=bond84]), but this 56Ni mass seems problematic given that it would be larger than the modest envelope mass indicated by the relatively fast rise and decay time (see below). In addition, the photometric decline of 0.042 mag d- 1 is faster than that of 56Co, 0.0098 mag d- 1, making radioactive heating unlikely as the dominant source of the energy.

Despite the lack of a Type IIn spectrum, the most likely interpretation seems to be that the high luminosity of SN 2008es is the result of converting shock energy into visual light. This can be accomplished, in principle, if the shock kinetic energy is thermalized throughout a massive envelope, like a normal SN II-P or II-L, but with a much larger initial radius of (2-3) ×  1015 cm (based on the peak luminosity and the evolution in Fig. [\ref=bol_lum]). Were the initial radius much smaller than this it would prove difficult to convert ~  1051 ergs of kinetic energy to ~  1051 ergs of radiation because there would be significant adiabatic losses. The apparent temperature evolution from ~  15,000 to 6000 K over a time period of ~  66 d (Fig. [\ref=bol_lum]), reminiscent of other normal SNe II, suggests that the recombination photosphere is receding through a cooling envelope in SN 2008es. In this scenario, the usual narrow/intermediate-width Hα emission that is taken as a signpost of CSM interaction might be avoided if the CSM shell is initially very opaque, and if the shock encounters no further CSM at larger radii (see [\citealt=smith06tf]).

Since the required initial radius exceeds that of the largest known red supergiants (see [\citealt=smith2001]) by a factor of 20-30, it requires the envelope to be an unbound, opaque CSM shell ejected prior to the SN explosion instead of a traditional bound stellar envelope. Similar models were suggested for SN 2005ap [\citep=quimby05ap], SN 2006gy [\citep=smith+mccray07], and SN 2006tf [\citep=smith06tf], implying CSM envelope masses of 0.6, ~  10, and 18 M[formula], respectively. The corresponding CSM mass for SN 2008es would be roughly ~  5 M[formula] in this scenario, because its evolution and expansion speeds are slower than those of SN 2005ap. This CSM mass of ~  5 M[formula] allows the observed Hα Doppler velocities to remain faster than in SNe 2006gy and 2006tf, where the heavy CSM shells decelerated the shocks to only 4000 and 2000 km s- 1, respectively ([\citealt=smith07-2006gy]; [\citealt=smith06tf]). The smaller CSM mass for SN 2008es relative to SNe 2006gy and 2006tf would also explain the comparatively short rise and decay observed for SN 2008es, as the light diffusion time for this SN is much shorter than in SNe 2006gy and 2006tf [\citep=smith+mccray07]. The putative envelope ejection preceding SN 2008es must have occurred 10-100 yr prior to the explosion (for an unknown progenitor wind speed of vCSM = 10-100 km s- 1), indicating a progenitor mass-loss rate of order 0.05-0.5 M[formula] yr- 1. This is much larger than any steady stellar wind (see [\citealt=smith07-2006gy], and references therein), providing another case of impulsive mass ejection in the decades immediately preceding some SNe.

An alternative analysis of SN 2008es, submitted for publication shortly after this paper was made available electronically, also suggests that the extreme luminosity is powered via interaction with CSM [\citep=gezari08]. However, the initial version of [\citet=gezari08] argues against an unbound CSM shell ejection prior to the SN explosion, and instead argues that the CSM is created by a dense progenitor wind.

The Host of SN 2008es

Currently there is no conclusive detection of the host galaxy of SN 2008es, so its metallicity and corresponding implications for the pre-SN evolution are not known. From SDSS DR6 images [\citep=adelman08], we derive a 3σ upper limit of mr'  >   22.7 mag at the SN position, which translates to roughly MV  >    -  17.4 mag at the SN redshift (neglecting any K corrections). Thus, the putative host galaxy is significantly less luminous than an L* galaxy and could be comparable to or fainter than the Small Magellanic Cloud (with MV =  - 16.9 mag).

Without a definitive detection of the host galaxy we assume that there is no host extinction. This assumption is further supported by both the low luminosity of the host galaxy and our BB fits (see §3) that show excellent agreement with our UV measurements, where the effects of host extinction would be especially prominent. In analogy with the underluminous hosts of SNe 2006tf [\citep=smith06tf] and 2005ap [\citep=quimby05ap], deep imaging after the SN has faded may uncover the host galaxy nearly coincident with the SN position, which would allow further constraints to be placed on extinction in the host. These three extreme SNe and their underluminous hosts may be hinting that very luminous SNe II preferentially occur in low-luminosity host galaxies.

Rates of Extremely Luminous SN 2008es-like Events

Over the past three years the TSS has successfully found tens of SNe with a surprising rate of unusual objects. The list of such SNe includes SN 2005ap, SN 2006gy, SN 2006tf, SN 2008am, and now SN 2008es. However, this apparent high anomaly rate is probably the result of combining a huge survey volume with an intrinsically rare class of objects. Following [\citet=quimby2008], we compare the volume probed by the TSS for SNe Ia, and bright core-collapse SNe. The highest redshift of the ~  30 SNe Ia found by the TSS is [formula], while SN 2005ap was found at [formula]. The comoving volume scanned by the TSS is therefore ~  23 times bigger for SN 2008es-like objects than for SNe Ia. Of the five bright objects found by the TSS, only two, SN 2005ap and SN 2008es, can be considered together as a class. Thus, the comparative rate is about 30 / 2  ×  23  ≈  350 times smaller.

The KAIT SN search [\citep=filippenkoLOSS] has discovered about 400 SNe Ia in the past 10 years in targeted nearby galaxies, hence the expected number of SN 2008es-like objects is of order 1. This is consistent with the nondetection of any such SN.

Using the light curve of SN 2008es and the accumulated observations of about 10,000 spiral galaxies in the KAIT sample which were observed regularly during the past ten years, we find an upper limit on the rate (per unit K-band luminosity) of such SNe to be about 1 / 160 times the local SN II rate [\citep=leaman2009]. Furthermore, we note that if SN 2008es-like events preferentially occur in small, low-metallicity galaxies (see § 5.2), the KAIT sample, which targets large, nearby galaxies, would be biased against the discovery of such a SN. While there are several SN search surveys with larger search volumes than the TSS, such as the SDSS-II Supernova Survey [\citep=sako08], the full details of these surveys (cadence, total survey volume, candidate SN color cuts, etc.) are not available at this time, and therefore we cannot directly compare them to the TSS. We conclude that the number of luminous Type II-L SNe, as discovered by the TSS, does not appear to be the result of a statistical fluke, and predict many such detections with future wide-field synoptic surveys.

Conclusions

We have reported on our early observations of SN 2008es, which at a peak optical magnitude of MV  =   - 22.3 is the second most luminous SN ever observed. We argue that the extreme luminosity of this SN was likely powered via strong interaction with a dense CSM, and that the steep decline in the light curve, 0.042 mag d- 1, indicates that the radioactive decay of 56Co is likely not the dominant source of energy for this SN. Integration of the bolometric light curve of SN 2008es yields a total radiated energy output of [formula] 1051 ergs. The optical spectra of SN 2008es resemble those of the luminous SN 1979C, but with an unexplained increase in the velocity of the Hβ absorption minimum over time.

We also examined the rate of discovery of extremely luminous SNe by the Texas Supernova Search and find that their discovery of the five most luminous observed SNe in the past four years is probably not a fluke; several more such detections are expected in the coming years.

Finally, what behavior can we expect from SN 2008es at late times, roughly 1 yr or more after discovery? Regardless of whether the peak luminosity was powered by radioactive decay or optically thick CSM interaction (see [\citealt=smith08-2006gy]), a SN can be powered by strong CSM interaction at late times if the progenitor had a sufficiently high mass-loss rate in the centuries before exploding. We have seen examples of both: SN 2006tf had strong Hα emission indicative of ongoing CSM interaction at late times [\citep=smith06tf], whereas SN 2006gy did not [\citep=smith08-2006gy]. SN 1979C was less luminous at peak than those two SNe, but it has been studied for three decades because its late-time CSM interaction is powering ongoing emission in the radio, optical, and X-rays [\citep=weiler81] [\citep=fesen93] [\citep=immler98]. With such an extraordinarily high peak luminosity, a late-time IR echo such as that seen in SN 2006gy [\citep=smith08-2006gy] is also likely if SN 2008es has dust waiting at a radius of ~  0.3 pc. Alternatively, if SN 2008es were powered in whole or in part by radioactivity, a large mass of 56Ni should be evident in the late-time decline rate.
