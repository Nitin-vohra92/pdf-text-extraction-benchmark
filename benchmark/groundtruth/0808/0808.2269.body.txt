Descent Construction For GSpin Groups: Main Results and Applications

The purpose of this note is to announce an extension of the descent method of Ginzburg, Rallis, and Soudry to the setting of essentially self dual representations. This extension of the descent construction provides a complement to recent work of Asgari and Shahidi [\cite=MR2219256] on the generic transfer for general Spin groups as well as to the work of Asgari and Raghuram [\cite=AsgariRaghuram] on cuspidality of the exterior square lift for representations of GL4. Complete proofs of the results announced in the present note will appear in our forthcoming article(s).

Preliminaries

GSpin groups and their quasisplit forms

Let F be a number field. By the classification results in Chapter 16 of [\cite=MR1642713] (see especially 16.3.2, 16.3.3, 16.4.2), and the definition of the L group, there is a unique quasisplit F group G such that the connected component of the identity in LG is [formula] This is GSpin2n + 1.

Similarly, there is a 1-1 correspondence between quasisplit F groups G such that [formula] and homomorphisms from [formula] to the group with two elements, and hence, by class field theory, with quadratic characters of [formula] (the case n = 4 is no different, see Section [\ref=finalrmrks]). The unique split group G such that [formula] corresponds to the trivial character. We denote this group GSpin2n. The finite Galois form of its L group is [formula] The form corresponding to the nontrivial character χ we denote by GSpinχ2n. The finite Galois form of its L group is [formula] where E is the quadratic extension of F corresponding to χ.

Liftings

According to the Langlands functoriality conjecture, one expects a lifting of automorphic representations of [formula] to automorphic representations of [formula] corresponding to the inclusion

[formula]

Similarly, one expects a lifting of automorphic representations of [formula] to automorphic representations of [formula] corresponding to the inclusion

[formula]

For (globally) generic representations, the existence of these liftings is proved in [\cite=MR2219256].

Now consider GSpinχ2n for χ  ≠  1. Regardless of χ, the L group [formula] with E as above, is isomorphic to [formula] and a specific isomorphism can be fixed by mapping the nontrivial element of Gal(E / F) to

[formula]

One then expects a lifting of automorphic representations of [formula] to automorphic representations of [formula] corresponding to the inclusion

[formula]

We understand that this is the subject of [\cite=A-S2]. We denote all of these liftings by AS.

Main results

The odd case

The even case

For the statement of the next main result, it will be convenient to define GSpinχ2n: = GSpin2n when χ is the trivial character.

Applications

The image of the weak lift AS

We now concentrate on the case of split general Spin groups. In [\cite=MR2219256] , the authors show the existence of functorial lifts from automorphic representations of [formula] or [formula] to [formula] They show that the images consist of automorphic representations which satisfy the essential self-duality condition at almost all places.

Based on the self-dual case, (cf. Theorem A of [\cite=MR1846354]) one expects that the image of each Asgari-Shahidi lifting consists of isobaric sums of distinct essentially self dual cuspidal representations satisfying the appropriate L-function condition. For example, any representation in the image of the lift from GSpin2n + 1 should be an isobaric sum of distinct ω-symplectic cuspidals, for some Hecke character ω.

Our results support this expectation. We provide a "lower bound" for the image of the Asgari-Shahidi lifting, by showing that any isobaric sum of distinct essentially self dual cuspidal representations satisfying the appropriate L-function condition is in the image of the appropriate lift.

The image of the exterior square lift: GL4 to GL6

The existence of an exterior square lift of a cuspidal automorphic representation of [formula] as an automorphic representation of [formula] was established by Kim in [\cite=MR1937203]. Recently, Asgari-Raghuram provided an explicit description of those cuspidal automorphic representations of [formula] whose exterior square lift to [formula] is not cuspidal. Among other things their argument requires the following special case of Theorem B.

Let Π be a cuspidal representation of [formula] and let ω be any character of [formula]. Assume that the partial L-function [formula] has a pole at s  =  1 for a sufficiently large finite set S of places of F. Let χ  =  ωΠω- 2. Then there exists a globally generic cuspidal representation π of [formula] such that π transfers to Π.

Roughly speaking, Asgari and Raghuram prove that the exterior square lift of a cuspidal representation Π of GL4 is cuspidal unless Π is isomorphic to a twist of either itself or its contragredient, and that this occurs only if Π is itself in the image of one of four functorial lifts. For the precise statement, see [\cite=AsgariRaghuram], Theorem 1.1, p.2. For the precise relationship with our results, see p. 12.

Scheme of Proof

The proofs of Theorem A and Theorem B are obtained by adapting (the special orthogonal group case of) the descent method of Ginzburg, Rallis, and Soudry [\cite=MR1671452] [\cite=MR1722953] [\cite=MR1740991] [\cite=MR1846354] [\cite=MR1954940]. The adaptation is reasonably straightforward owing to two observations:

There is a surjective homomorphism, defined over F, from GSpinm to SOm, which restricts to an isomorphism between the unipotent subvarieties.

The kernel of this projection is contained in the center of GSpinm. Thus, the action GSpinm on itself by conjugation factors through the projection.

In what follows we detail the steps needed to prove Theorem B. The proof of Theorem A is similar and technically simpler.

The input to the construction is a collection [formula] of cuspidal representations τi of [formula] for [formula] satisfying the assumptions of Theorem B. Let [formula] Then [formula] is a quadratic character.

We can conveniently describe the method in the following steps:

Construction of a family of descent representations of [formula] for [formula].

Vanishing of the descent representations for all [formula] and all [formula]

Cuspidality and genericity (hence nonvanishing) of the descent representation of [formula].

Matching of spectral parameters at unramified places.

The construction of the descent representations relies on the notion of Fourier coefficient, as defined in [\cite=MR1981592], [\cite=MR2214128] (cf. also the "Gelfand-Graev" coefficients of [\cite=MR2141707]). For purposes of presenting certain of the global arguments, it seems convenient to embed these Fourier coefficients into a slightly larger family of functionals, which we shall refer to as "unipotent periods."

Suppose that U is a unipotent subgroup of GSpin4n + 1 and ψ is a character of [formula] We define the corresponding unipotent period to be the map from smooth, left U(F)-invariant functions on [formula] to smooth, left [formula]-equivariant functions, given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

Each unipotent period has a local analogue at each finite place, which is a twisted Jacquet functor.

Suppose now that U is the unipotent radical of a standard parabolic subgroup, and let M denote the Levi. The characters of [formula] may be identified with the points of an F-vector space, so that the stabilizer StabM(ψ) makes sense as an algebraic group defined over F. We assume that ψ corresponds to a point in general position. Then the map

[formula]

is indeed a "Fourier coefficient," as defined (and associated to a nilpotent orbit) in [\cite=MR1981592] [\cite=MR2214128]. It maps smooth functions of moderate growth on [formula] to smooth functions of moderate growth on [formula]

Let S be a set of unipotent periods. We will say that another unipotent period (U,ψ) is spanned by S if

[formula]

We are now ready to describe each of the four steps listed above in more detail.

Step one: Construction of the descent representations

Using [formula] a space of Eisenstein series Eτ,ω(g, on [formula] is constructed- corresponding to a representation induced from the standard parabolic subgroup P = MU of GSpin4n + 1 for which [formula] The partial L functions

[formula]

appear in the constant terms of elements of this space. As a consequence, some of them have non-vanishing multi-residues at a certain point 0, precisely because of the L-function hypothesis on τ. In this fashion we obtain a residual representation- which lies in the discrete spectrum of [formula]- the nontriviality of which depends intrinsically on this L-function condition. We denote this representation by E- 1(,ω).

Now, GSpin4n + 1 contains a family of parabolic subgroups [formula] to 2n, with [formula] isomorphic to [formula] having the crucial property that for each character ψ of [formula] in general position, the identity component of the group [formula] is isomorphic to one of the groups [formula] Fixing specific isomorphisms, we may pull back each Fourier coefficient

[formula]

as described above, to a space of functions defined on [formula] There are many characters ψ for a given value of [formula] and χ, but they comprise a single orbit for the action of [formula] by conjugation, and the various spaces FCψ(E- 1(,ω)) all pull back to the same space of functions on [formula] regardless of the choice of ψ in this orbit and regardless of the choice of isomorphism [formula] (For this, we require the extension of meromorphic continuation of Eisenstein series to non-K-finite sections, provided in [\cite=MR2402686].)

In this manner we obtain a space of functions on [formula] for each value of χ. The family of representations thus obtained comprises the descent representations.

Step two: Vanishing of other descents

For [formula] one shows that the above Fourier coefficients vanish identically on our residue representation E- 1(τ,ω). The reason is local: the corresponding twisted Jacquet module of the unramified constituent of the corresponding local induced representation vanishes. The same is true if [formula] at any unramified place v such that the identity component of StabLn(ψ) is not isomorphic to GSpinχ2n over Fv.

The remaining descent representation, corresponding to [formula] and [formula] may now be referred to as "the" descent without ambiguity.

Step Three: Cuspidality and genericity of the descent

Next we appeal to global arguments which may be presented in terms of "identities of unipotent periods."

Consider the unipotent period on [formula] which consists of taking the constant term with respect to the maximal parabolic with Levi isomorphic to GL2n  ×  GL1, and then taking a Whittaker integral on the GL2n Levi. It can be shown that this unipotent period does not vanish on our residue representation E- 1(,ω). One shows that this unipotent period is, in fact, spanned by the periods corresponding to Whittaker integrals on the descent representations (as [formula] and χ vary).

Having proved by local arguments that these periods vanishes identically on the residue representation E- 1(τ,ω), whenever [formula] or χ  ≠  χτ, we deduce that they do not vanish identically when [formula] and χ  =  χτ. This shows that the space FCψ(E- 1(τ,ω)) is not only nontrivial, but supports a nontrivial global Whittaker integral.

Next, consider the unipotent periods on [formula] which consist of taking the constant term with respect to the maximal parabolic with Levi isomorphic to GLk  ×  GSpin4n - 2k + 1 for some k, and then, if k is even, performing the integral one would use to define a descent representation of GSpin4n - 2k + 1, with some value of [formula] larger than [formula] Combining the vanishing results of Step two with well-known facts from the theory of Eisenstein series, we deduce that all of these periods vanish identically on the residue representation E- 1(τ,ω). We then show that the unipotent period which corresponds to taking the constant term of one of the functions in FCψ(E- 1(,ω)) is in their span.

It follows that all the functions in the descent are cuspidal. At this point, we may deduce that the descent representation decomposes discretely as a direct sum of irreducible cuspidal automorphic representations, at least one of which is generic. We select one such component for the representation σ of Theorem B. What remains is to show that σ lifts weakly to [formula]

Step Four: Matching of spectral parameters at unramified places

For [formula] at an unramified place, where the identity component of StabLn(ψ) is isomorphic to GSpinχτ2n, the twisted Jacquet module of the unramified constituent of the local induced representation is isomorphic, as a StabLn(ψ)(Fv)-module to a certain induced representation of StabLn(ψ)(Fv). When restricted to the identity component, this representation may not be irreducible. Nevertheless, we are able to deduce that any nonzero irreducible component of the Fourier coefficient must lift weakly to [formula]

Final Remarks

When considering the identification of [formula] with [formula] one could also map the nontrivial element to

[formula]

This produces a slightly different functorial lift corresponding to the twist of the one we have chosen above by the quadratic character χ. Theorem B is, of course, true for this "alternate" lifting, as well, since one may "untwist."

These are essentially the only distinct extensions of the inclusion [formula] to [formula] in the following sense. Suppose V1 and V2 are two 2n dimensional representations of [formula] such that the restriction of either to [formula] is the standard representation. Then one may show that V2 is isomorphic to either V1 or the twist of V1 by the unique nontrivial character of Gal(E / F).

A natural question arises in the case n = 4: does the 3-fold symmetry of the Dynkin diagram of GSpin8 lead to additional quasi-split forms? The answer is no, because the 3-fold symmetry of the D4 root system does not extend to a symmetry of the root data of GSO8 and GSpin8.
