Suppose Y is a closed irreducible 3-manifold, F  ⊂  Y is a closed connected surface of genus [formula]. If [formula], then Y fibers over the circle with F as a fiber.

The case that g = 1 is already treated in [\cite=KMBook], following the argument of Ghiggini [\cite=Gh].

Suppose Y is a closed irreducible 3-manifold, F  ⊂  Y is a torus, η is a 1-cycle in Y that intersects F once. If [formula], then Y fibers over the circle with F as a fiber.

The statement of [\cite=KMBook] uses a field [formula] of characteristic 2, because the proof involves the surgery exact sequence whose proof requires characteristic 2. Kronheimer pointed out that this part can be replaced by the Excision Theorem [\cite=KMsuture], which allows us to use any characteristic.

Let M be the manifold obtained by cutting Y open along F. The two boundary components of M are denoted by F-,F+. M can be viewed as a sutured manifold with empty suture.

M is a homology product, namely,

[formula]

By [\cite=MengTaubes] [\cite=Turaev] [\cite=Kcommunication], Turaev's torsion function [formula] is, up to a sign, equal to the Euler characteristic of [formula] when [formula] and [formula] is a non-torsion Spinc structure. The argument in [\cite=NiClosedMfd] shows that M is a homology product if [formula].

If b1(Y) = 1, as suggested by Kronheimer, one can consider the double of M along ∂M, denoted by Z. Of course [formula]. Moreover, by [\cite=KMsuture] we have [formula]. Let M2 be the double of M along F-, then M2 is a homology product as in the last paragraph. Now [\cite=NiClosedMfd] implies that M is also a homology product.

Suppose [formula] is a maximal collection of mutually disjoint, nonparallel, genus g closed surfaces in Y, such that each surface is homologous to F. [formula] are the components of the manifold obtained by cutting Y open along these surfaces, [formula]. Let Ek be the subgroup of H1(Mk) spanned by the first homologies of the product annuli in Mk. Then Ek = H1(Mk) for each k.

Since M is a homology product, we can glue its two boundary components together by a homeomorphism to obtain a new manifold Z such that Z has the same homology as F  ×  S1. If Ek  ≠  H1(Mk) for some k, then as in [\cite=NiClosedMfd] we can construction two smooth taut foliations [formula] of Z, such that Fk,Fk + 1 are compact leaves of [formula], and

[formula]

It then follows that

[formula]

by [\cite=KMBook]. By [\cite=KMsuture] we have [formula], which is a contradiction to the assumption that [formula].

Let (Πk,Ψk) be the characteristic product pair (see [\cite=NiCorr]) for (Mk,∂Mk), then the map

[formula]

is surjective.

See the proof of [\cite=NiCorr].

By Corollary [\ref=CharSurj], each Πk contains a submanifold Gk  ×  I, where Gk is a genus 1 surface with one boundary component. Cutting Y open along Fk's and regluing by suitable homeomorphisms, we can get a new manifold Y' such that the Gk  ×  I's match together to form a submanifold G  ×  S1  ⊂  Y', where G is a genus 1 surface with one boundary component. By [\cite=KMsuture], we have

[formula]

Let M' be the manifold obtained by cutting Y' open along F, then M' is a homology product, and M' contains a product submanifold G  ×  I. Let M'' be the exterior of G  ×  I in M', and let γ = (∂G)  ×  I. Then (M'',γ) is a sutured manifold which is a homology product. By [\cite=KMsuture], we have

[formula]

Now [\cite=KMsuture] implies that M'' is a product, thus M' is also a product. So Y' and hence Y fiber over the circle.
