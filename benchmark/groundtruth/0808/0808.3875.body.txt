On a Hamiltonian form of an elliptic spin Ruijsenaars-Schneider system

Introduction

An elliptic Ruijenaars-Schneider (RS) model [\cite=RS86] is a Hamiltonian system of N interacting particles with a Hamiltonian

[formula]

and the canonical symplectic form [formula], where [formula].

The equations of motions are

[formula]

where V(x)  =  ζ(x + η) - ζ(x), and ζ(x) is a Weierstrass zeta function.

The limit when one or two periods of the elliptic curve go to infinity yields a trigonometric or rational system. A RS system is a relativistic generalization of the Calogero-Moser model.

A spin generalization of RS system was suggested in [\cite=KZ95]. Each particle additionally carries two l-dimensional vectors ai and bi that describe the internal degrees of freedom and affect the interaction. Remarkably, the equations of motion remain integrable and are given by the formulas

[formula]

where fij  =  bTiaj.

It was shown in [\cite=IK98] using the universal symplectic form (proposed in [\cite=KP97]) that a spin elliptic RS system is Hamiltonian. An expression of a symplectic form (or Poisson structure) in explicit coordinates is known only in the rational and trigonometric limits (see [\cite=AF98]).

The aim of this paper is to compute ω in the original coordinates xi and fij in the simplest elliptic case of 2 particles, N = 2. We compare the obtained 2-form with a symplectic form for a system without spin and with a Poisson structure found in [\cite=AF98] in the rational case.

Symplectic form in the case N = 2

The general procedure developed by Krichever and Phong in [\cite=KP97] allows to construct action-angle variables for an elliptic RS system and its spin generalization. It was done in [\cite=IK98]. The upshot of the procedure is the following.

A Lax representation with a spectral parameter for an elliptic RS system has been found in [\cite=KZ95]. A Lax matrix is

[formula]

The spectral parameter z is defined on an elliptic curve Γ0 with a cut between points z = η and z =  - η.

The universal symplectic form is given by the formula

[formula]

where the sum is taken over the poles of L and zeroes of [formula]. Ψ is a matrix composed of eigenvectors of L, which has poles s on the spectral curve [formula] due to normalization of eigenvectors. k is a meromorphic function on [formula] and the matrix K = diag(k1,...,kN) is composed of values of k on different sheets of [formula].

ω doesn't depend on the gauge transformations L  →  gLg- 1 and the normalization of eigenvectors on the leaves where the form δ ln kdz is holomorphic. [formula] is a meromorphic differential, and the sum of all its residues is zero. Using these facts, one can show that on the leaves

[formula]

Computations performed in [\cite=IK98] for Lax matrix ([\ref=laxrs]) show that

[formula]

where

[formula]

and the Hamiltonian for system ([\ref=RS1]) is [formula].

A Lax representation with a spectral parameter for an elliptic spin RS system ([\ref=RS2]) has been found in [\cite=KZ95]. The Lax matrix is Lij = fijΦ(xi - xj  -  η). Formally, equations ([\ref=RS2]) are Hamiltonian with [formula] and symplectic form ([\ref=form]) (see [\cite=IK98] for details). The goal of this paper is to compute form ([\ref=form]) in the original coordinates xi and fij.

After the gauge transformation by a diagonal matrix g = diag(Φ(x1,z),λΦ(x2,z)) with an appropriate choice of λ, the matrix Lij becomes

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula].

The matrix L is defined on a curve Γ of genus g = 2, which is a 2-sheeted cover of the elliptic curve Γ0 with 2 branch points z = η and z =  - η.

The spectral curve [formula] of L is defined by the equation [formula]. It is a 2-sheeted cover of Γ, and the function ∂kR has 4 simple poles on [formula] above points z =   ±  η. ∂kR is a meromorphic function on [formula], hence it also has 4 zeroes. Its zeroes are precisely the branch points of [formula] over Γ, and the Riemann-Hurwitz formula implies that the genus of [formula] is ĝ = 5.

The matrix valued differential Ldz can be seen as a global section of the bundle [formula]. Vγ,α is a vector bundle determined by Tyurin parameters z(γi) =  - x1  -  η, z(γj) =  - x2  -  η, and αi = (0,1)T, αj = (1,0)T, where i = 1,2 and j = 3,4.

The set I in ([\ref=form]) is I = {γs,0,  ±  z0}, where z0 is defined by the equation [formula], or

[formula]

Notice, that we can use variables (x1,x2,f1,f2,z0) instead of (x1,x2,f1,f2,f3).

In the case N = 2 the elliptic spin RS system is Hamiltonian with a symplectic form

[formula]

and Hamiltonian H = f1 + f2, where ṽ(x) = ζ(x + z0) - ζ(x). The spinless case corresponds to z0  =  η.

The eigenvector ψ of L in any normalization is a meromorphic function on [formula] and it has ĝ + 1 = 6 poles s. The proof of formula ([\ref=uform]) in [\cite=IK04] assumes that the situation is in general position, i.e. projections of points i don't coincide with γs.

Most appropriate normalization here is [formula], because it easily allows us to find poles s of ψ. Two of them (s = 1,2) lie above the point z = x1 - x2, and the other are above z =  - x1  -  η (s = 3,4,5,6). This is not the case of general position, but it turns out that the same formula ([\ref=uform]) still holds.

The proof in [\cite=IK02] and [\cite=IK04] implies that 2-form ([\ref=form]) in the normalization [formula] equals to [formula]

A change of normalization of Ψ from [formula] to [formula] (the last one is in "general position") corresponds to the transformation Ψ̃  =  ΨV, where

[formula]

According to the computations in [\cite=IK04],

[formula]

Since ω has to be restricted to the leaves where δ ln kdz is holomorphic (which is equivalent to 2 conditions: δη = 0 and δz0 = 0), the only non-zero residue in the second term is at the point z(γi) =  - x1  -  η. After computing the residue, we get that [formula], i.e. effectively formula ([\ref=uform]) holds in both normalizations.

Substituting s in ([\ref=uform]), we find that

[formula]

where ṽ(x) = ζ(x + z0) - ζ(x).

The Hamiltonian H = f1 + f2 defines the flow

[formula]

Using identities for Weierstrass σ-functions, namely,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

it follows from the definition of z0 that

[formula]

[formula]

With the help of this identity, we can show that the above equations are equivalent to

[formula]

which is an RS system.

The spinless case occurs when f23  =  f1f2 and z0  =  η as one can observe from ([\ref=imprel]).

Remark. A Poisson structure was found in [\cite=AF98] in the rational limit for arbitrary N (see formula (3.31) in [\cite=AF98]). In the case of 2 particles it is non-degenerate and defined on a 6-dimensional space (f11,f12,f21,f22,x1,x2). The corresponding 2-form is defined on the same space and coincides with ([\ref=newform]) on the leaves δz0 = 0 and after reduction with respect to the action [formula].
