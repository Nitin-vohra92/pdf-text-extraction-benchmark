Three-body final state interaction in η  →  3π revisited

Introduction

Three meson systems play an important role in studies of hadron reaction dynamics and hadron spectroscopy. For example, in three-particle decays of heavy quarkonia several candidates for non-quark model resonances have recently been observed [\cite=PDG-2015] [\cite=Aaij:2014jqa] [\cite=Swanson:2006st]. Three-body decays of B and D mesons are a promising laboratory for studies of CP-violation [\cite=Aaij:2013sfa] [\cite=Aaij:2013bla]. In the light meson sector the limited phase space makes three-particle decays an ideal testing ground of effective theories of strong interactions. Detailed amplitude analysis of three meson production becomes even more important in light of the current and forthcoming high precision data from various hadron facilities [\cite=Battaglieri:2010zza] [\cite=Eugenio:2003] [\cite=Adolph:2014rpp] [\cite=Ablikim:2015cmz].

The isospin breaking η  →  3π decay, which we consider here, is of great importance as it allows to measure the light quark mass difference. The electromagnetic effects are known to be small [\cite=Sutherland:1966zz] [\cite=Bell:1996mi] [\cite=Ditsche:2008cq], and the decay is driven by strong interactions through the ΔI = 1 isospin breaking transition that appears directly in the QCD Lagrangian. The decay amplitude is proportional to the light quark mass difference, (mu - md), and it is conventionally expressed in terms of the parameter Q2 defined by

[formula]

with ms being the strange quark mass. Note, that this double ratio ([\ref=Eq:Q]) is protected to strong high order corrections. Given the small breakup momenta the distribution of pions in the Dalitz plot of the η  →  π+π-π0 decay can be analyzed in terms of a small number of parameters that determine deviations from a uniform distribution. These parameters are referred to as Dalitz plot parameters. Early analyses [\cite=Gormley:1970qz] [\cite=Layter:1973ti] [\cite=Abele:1998yj] could determine only a few, leading Dalitz plot paramters. A few more parameters were determined using the 2008 KLOE measurement [\cite=Ambrosino:2008ht]. These analyses were further improved thanks to the high-quality WASA-at-COSY [\cite=Adlarson:2014aks] and KLOE-2 [\cite=Anastasi:2016qvh] data. The statistics of the most resent measurements is high enough to allow for binned, data-driven analysis.

On the theoretical side there has been significant progress in chiral, effective field theory analysis of η decays. Chiral perturbation theory (χPT) seems to converge poorly, yielding Γη  →  π+π-π0  =   66, [formula], ~  300 eV at leading (LO), next-to-leading (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading (NNLO) order, respectively [\cite=Cronin:1967jq] [\cite=Osborn:1970nn] [\cite=Gasser:1984pr] [\cite=Bijnens:2007pr]. This indicates importance of pion-pion interactions and various approaches have been used to implement these effects to all orders [\cite=Colangelo:2009db] [\cite=Lanz:2013ku] [\cite=Schneider:2010hs] [\cite=Kampf:2011wr] [\cite=Descotes-Genon:2014tla].

In our recent study [\cite=Guo:2015zqa] we implemented the S-matrix constraints of unitarity, analyticity and crossing symmetry via a set of dispersion relations [\cite=Khuri:1960kt] [\cite=Kambor:1995yc] [\cite=Anisovich:1996tx]. Connection with QCD is achieved by matching the dispersive amplitudes with χPT at the point where the latter converges best i.e. below the threshold. In [\cite=Guo:2015zqa] we used WASA-at-COSY data [\cite=Adlarson:2014aks] to determine the free parameters, i.e. subtraction constants of the dispersive integrals. As a result, we achieved a simultaneous description of the Dalitz plot distributions of the charged and neutral η decay modes. In order to extract the parameter Q we matched the dispersive amplitude with the next-to-leading order (NLO) χPT result near the Adler zero and we obtained [formula] [\cite=Guo:2015zqa]. The purpose of this letter is to revisit the result of [\cite=Guo:2015zqa] in a view of the new high statistic data from the KLOE-2 experiment [\cite=Anastasi:2016qvh].

The method

In this section, we briefly review the η decay amplitudes that were developed in [\cite=Guo:2015zqa]. For η  →  3π, the transition amplitude A(s,t,u) is a function of three Mandelstam variables s = (pπ+  +  pπ-)2, t = (pπ-  +  pπ0)2, and u  =  (pπ+  +  pπ0)2 which are related by s + t + u  =  m2η  +  3  m2π. Except for the phase-space boundary, we work in the isospin limit and take mπ  =  (2  mπ+ + mπ0) / 3. At low energies, one can perform a partial wave (p.w.) decomposition while crossing symmetry implies unitarity cuts in all three Mandelstam variables. Therefore we symmetrize the p.w. expansion in all three channels [\cite=Khuri:1960kt] [\cite=Bronzan:1963kt] [\cite=Aitchison:1965kt] [\cite=Aitchison:1965dt] [\cite=Aitchison:1966kt] [\cite=Pasquier:1968kt] [\cite=Pasquier:1969dt], which for the charged decay, η  →  π+π-π0, implies the following representation,

[formula]

The amplitudes aIL have only the right-hand, unitary cuts. In Eq. ([\ref=ampc]) [formula] and θs,t,u are the center-of-mass scattering angles in the s, t and u-channels, respectively. The subscript (I,L) labels isospin and orbital angular momentum, with I + L = even due to Bose symmetry. The latter implies that for Lmax = 1 there are three unknown isospin amplitudes with (I,L) = (0,0),  (2,0),  (1,1). An amplitude of the neutral decay, η  →  3π0 can be easily reconstructed using ΔI = 1 relation,

[formula]

We emphasize, that the decomposition in Eq.([\ref=ampc]) has the same analytical properties as the amplitude in NNLO chiral expansion [\cite=Stern:1993rg] [\cite=Knecht:1995tr]. However, in contrast to χPT, we can impose unitarity to all orders on the aIL amplitudes. The discontinuity along the right-hand cut can be expressed through the elastic ππ partial wave amplitudes fIL, which leads to

[formula]

where ãIL(s) = aIL(s) / ZL(s) has no kinematical singularities and ZL(s) is proportional to the product of the c.m. momenta of ππ and πη [\cite=Guo:2015zqa]. The normalization is fixed by the phase space factor [formula], with (1 / fIL(s)) =  - ρ(s). The explicit form of the crossing matrices CII'st,su can be found in [\cite=Guo:2015zqa]. The contribution from the first term on the right-hand side of Eq. ([\ref=dis]) reproduces the direct s-channel unitarity, while the second term contains the left-hand cuts from the t and u-channels. While calculating the latter, special care has to be taken for 4  m2π  ≤  s < (mη + mπ)2, i.e. one has to deform the contour to avoid the cut along the real axis [\cite=Gribov:1962fu] [\cite=PhysRev.132.2712] [\cite=Bronzan:1963kt]. The kinematical singularity free amplitudes ãIL(s) satisfy the Cauchy representation, which up to subtraction constants yields,

[formula]

The combination of ([\ref=dis2]) and ([\ref=dis]) sets the so-called Khuri-Treiman (KT) framework that can be solved using several techniques [\cite=Guo:2014vya]. The most popular method is to write a set of dispersion relation for the ratio ãIL(s) / ΩIL(s) with ΩIL(s) being the Omnès function [\cite=Colangelo:2009db] [\cite=Descotes-Genon:2014tla]. In this case it is necessary to make further assumptions about unknown high-energy region which is typically done by introducing subtractions. This procedure may be justified for ω  →  3π decay which depends dominantly on the pion-pion P-wave scattering input[\cite=Niecknig:2012sj] [\cite=Danilkin:2014cra]. However, this is challenging for η  →  3π decay, where the dominant contribution comes from the S-wave and the form of the ππ isoscalar Omnès function is very sensitive to the asymptotic behavior of the phase shift δIL = 00(s  →    ∞  ). A complementary approach is the Pasquier inversion [\cite=Pasquier:1968kt] [\cite=Aitchison:1978pw] that we applied to analyze WASA-at-COSY data in [\cite=Guo:2015zqa] and use here as well. This method uses contour deformation to exchange the order of double integral appearing on the right hand side of Eq. ([\ref=dis2]).

To proceed we write ãIL(s) in the form

[formula]

where the function FIL(s) is introduced to remove Adler zeros specific to the elastic amplitude fIL(s) and introduce zeros in the decay amplitude as required by chiral symmetry. From Eq. ([\ref=dis]) and Eq. ([\ref=Eq:product]) one can derive the discontinuity of gIL and write the dispersive representation for gIL(s). As a result we obtain a double integral equations for gIL(s), which can be reduced to a single integral equation using the Pasquier inversion,

[formula]

The explicit form of the kernel functions, KIL,I'L'(s,t) can be found in [\cite=Guo:2015zqa]. The first term and the part of the second term on the right-hand side have the left-hand cut and can be expanded in the Taylor series in the physical region. Retaining only a single term in the expansion we arrive at the following relation [\cite=Guo:2014vya] [\cite=Guo:2015kla]

[formula]

which is solved by discretizing the integral and inverting the kernel matrix. The subtraction point, s0 is chosen to be near the Adler zero at leading order of χPT, s0≃4 / 3  m2π, and the subtraction constants gIL(s0), which absorb the left hand cut contribution are the free parameters that are to be determined by fitting to the data.

Numerical results

The η  →  3π Dalitz plot distribution is conventionally expressed in terms of the variables x,y which are defined by

[formula]

For charge decay Qc  =  mη - 2  m+π - m0π and for the neutral decay Qn  =  mη - 3  m0π. Kinematics restrict the events to be contained within the unit disk x2 + y2  ≤  1. The KLOE-2 [\cite=Ambrosino:2008ht] and WASA-at-COSY [\cite=Adlarson:2014aks] data were binned into 371 and 59 sectors of the unit disk, respectively (only bins that lie completely inside the physical region are included). We determine the unknown parameters, gIL(s0) by minimizing

[formula]

where [formula] is the acceptance corrected data in each bin and [formula] is the uncertainty (assumed to be only statistical).

In our earlier work [\cite=Guo:2015zqa] we performed two different fits to the WASA-at-COSY data. The first fit was done using only two resonant p.w. amplitudes, i.e. (I,L) = (0,0),  (1,1) and the second fit included all isospin amplitudes for the S and the P waves, i.e. (I,L) = (0,0),  (2,0),  (1,1). Here we follow the same procedure. The resulting parameters are collected in Tables [\ref=tab:par] and [\ref=tab:par2], where we show fits with and without three-particle rescattering effects (so called "two-body" and "three-body" scenarios), i.e using ([\ref=gapprox]) to determine gIL(s), or just setting it to a constant gIL(s) = gIL(s0).

In the first step we fit the KLOE-2 data alone. When only (I,L) = (0,0),  (1,1) amplitudes are taken into account, we observe a significant reduction of χ2 / d.o.f while moving from the "two-body" to the "three body" case. At the same time, when a complete set of S and P waves is incorporated, the χ2 / d.o.f stabilizes at around 1.2-1.3 in both cases. In the second step, we combine the KLOE-2 and WASA-at-COSY data. The results are in general very similar, showing the consistency of two different data sets.

The Dalitz plot parameters are defined as an effective range expansion around the center of the Dalitz plot x = y = 0,

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. In Table [\ref=tab:xy] we show the averaged Dalitz Plot parameters between three-body fits with (I,L) = (0,0),  (1,1) and (I,L) = (0,0),  (2,0),  (1,1) wave sets. We also predict the slope parameter α for the neutral decay mode to be

[formula]

from the KLOE-2 and combined KLOE-2 & WASA-at-COSY fits, respectively. The new results compares favorably with the most recent PDG value [formula] [\cite=PDG-2015].

Matching to χPT and the Q-value

We note, that NLO χPT result depends on four low energy constants (LECs). These can be reduced to a single one [formula] [\cite=Amoros:2001cp] if one employs Gell-Mann-Okubo constraint between meson masses and meson decay constants. This is not the case at NNLO where one has to deal with several unknown LEC's. Therefore, in our analysis we match the dispersive amplitudes with NLO χPT near the Adler zero. By considering a combined fit to KLOE-2 and WASA-at-COSY data as our main result, the updated Q-value is

[formula]

which should be compared to the result of [\cite=Guo:2015zqa] Q = 21.4  ±  0.4 (the fit to WASA-at-COSY data only) and Q = 21.7  ±  0.4 (the fit to KLOE-2 data only). Note, that the obtained Q-value is consistent with the latest (Nf  =  2 + 1 + 1) lattice computations [formula] [\cite=Aoki:2016frl].

There are several challenges in the accurate determination of the Q-value. The first now comes from the elastic ππ scattering amplitudes, which are available from Roy analyses [\cite=GarciaMartin:2011cn]. Second uncertainty is due to experimental η  →  π+π-π0 decay width, which serves as an input in our analysis. Its value increased by more than 3σ over the last thirty years, resulting in the current PDG value [formula] eV [\cite=PDG-2015]. Third source of uncertainty is the experimental data on Dalitz plot itself, which thanks to the recent high-statistical analyses has improved significantly. Another uncertainty comes from matching to χPT amplitude. Finally, there is also a systematic uncertainty coming from the theoretical model assumption. The latter can only be estimated by comparing different theoretical approaches for η  →  3π. Therefore, our error for the Q-value values should be viewed as a lower bound of the full error.

Conclusions

In this work we revisited our previous dispersive analysis [\cite=Guo:2015zqa] of the η  →  3π decay in light of the new KLOE-2 [\cite=Ambrosino:2008ht] data. Within our unitary model we established a unified description of charged and neutral decay modes. The method is based on Khuri-Treiman equation which is consistent with elastic unitarity, analyticity and crossing symmetry. Using the input from the ππ amplitude, the Khuri-Treiman equation was solved using Pasquier inversion technique. This allowed to establish a significant reduction of the unknown parameters compared to a more straightforward Omnès solution. However, the price is the treatment of the left-hand cuts, which is in general not known. We assume, that the unitarity in the physical region, where it can be constrained by the data, plays the key role and does not depend on an accurate from of the unphysical left-hand cuts. The latter we absorbed in the subtraction constants [\cite=Guo:2014vya]. With these model assumptions we were able to describe the data from KLOE-2 [\cite=Ambrosino:2008ht] and WASA-at-COSY [\cite=Adlarson:2014aks] with a minimal number fitting parameters.

The new results are α  =   - 0.025  ±  0.004 and Q = 21.6  ±  0.4. Since the experimental data on η  →  3π Dalitz plot is very precise now, the main uncertainties come from I = 0 two-pion scattering amplitudes and the decay width Γη  →  π+π-π0. Improving them are relevant for further Q-value and α determinations.
