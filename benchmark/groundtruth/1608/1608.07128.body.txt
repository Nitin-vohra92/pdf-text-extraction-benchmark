Hybrid surface waves in 2D Rashba-Dresselhaus materials

Tremendous progress in laser physics and nanotechnology stimulated activity in the field of light-matter interaction in low dimensional systems. A plethora of light-induced phenomena ranging from pump-probe spectroscopy [\cite=Kling2008] to ultrafast magnetization dynamics [\cite=Kirilyuk2010] form a basis of our understanding. In most cases light-matter coupling is considered to be small enough so that all physically relevant effects, associated with transition from one eigenstate to another and accompanied with absorption or emission of light quanta, can be captured perturbatively. However, this simple picture breaks when light-matter interaction is intensive enough and the regime of strong light-matter interaction is achieved. It was recently predicted that in this regime transport and optical properties of low-dimensional electronic structures can change dramatically [\cite=Morimoto2009] [\cite=Wittmann2010] [\cite=Tarasenko2011] [\cite=Pervishko2015] [\cite=Morina2015]. In particular, it can be expected that external pumping may be used as a unique tool to address surface electromagnetic waves in low-dimensional guiding structures [\cite=Polo2011]. These waves can be subdivided to belong to one of the two classes: surface electromagnetic waves residing at the boundary between two media with permittivities of opposite signs, and surface electromagnetic waves emerging due to the optical anisotropy of surrounding media with permittivities of the same sign (Dyakonov waves [\cite=Dyakonov1988]). The simplest example of the waves of the first type is surface plasmon polariton at metal-dielectric interface [\cite=Schuller2010] [\cite=Pitarke2007]. Plasmon excitations are widely used in surface spectroscopy and have been demonstrated to be capable of supersensitive sensoring [\cite=Zalyubovskiy2012], can be used for local spectroscopy and nanolithography with unprecedented spatial resolution which dramatically exceeds the Rayleigh limit [\cite=Lozovik1999]. Another possible application of surface plasmons and plasmon polaritons is in the field of ultrafast information transfer, which is known to be faster than that with electron current pulses. Wide range of the applications of plasmonics allows to keep it among the trends of the modern applied science. It should be noted, however, that all these promising applications are significantly restricted by the strong damping of plasmons, and search of novel systems with low damping rates, e.g. based on doped graphene [\cite=Kumar2016], becomes an actual task.

One of the possible ways to reduce damping is to use conducting interface sandwiched between two conventional insulators instead of the metal-dielectric boundary. In this geometry surface electromagnetic mode is formed because tangential component of the electric field at the conducting interface generates surface current density which leads to a discontinuity in the tangential magnetic field [\cite=Slepyan1999] [\cite=Mehrany2004] [\cite=Mikhailov2007]. Examples of such a conducting interface are a two dimensional electron gas in quantum-well structures or electrons in graphene characterized by linear dispersion relation [\cite=Iorsh2013] [\cite=Yudin2015] [\cite=Kumar2016]. In this Letter we focus on theoretical analysis of the optical response and propagation properties of hybrid surface electromagnetic waves in thin film semiconductor with spin-orbit interaction (SOI) of Rashba and Dresselhaus type. The competition between these couplings was shown to lead to such phenomena as emergence of Hall-type conductivity [\cite=Bryksin2006] [\cite=Yudin2016] and anisotropic plasmon dynamics [\cite=Badalyan2009] [\cite=Cruz2014], which makes dynamics of Rashba-Dresselhaus systems more rich as compare to the systems with Dresselhaus or Rashba SOI only [\cite=Pletyukhov2006].

The single-particle Hamiltonian of spin-orbit coupled 2DEG can be represented as sum of the terms corresponding to the kinetic energy and SOI [formula]. SOI term reads:

[formula]

and is characterized by two real parameters: Rashba spin-orbit coupling strength α, resulting from asymmetry of confining potential, and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling strength β, stemming from the lack of inversion symmetry of a crystal; σ̂i are Pauli matrices and [formula] is the electron momentum restricted to 2D. Following the standard paradigm, the charge current conductivity tensor is estimated as a linear response to a frequency-dependent and spatially homogeneous weak electric field. The angular anisotropy of the energy splitting due to the simultanious presence of the Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions gives rise to a finite-frequency response with spectral features significantly different from those of a pure Rashba or Dresselhaus model. The effect of linear Dresselhaus coupling was shown to have a profound impact on transport properties of the systems [\cite=Miller2003] [\cite=Schliemann2003a] [\cite=Schliemann2003b] [\cite=Mishchenko2003] [\cite=Ganichev2004] [\cite=Sinitsyn2004] [\cite=Shen2004] [\cite=Erlingsson2005]. For a probing field with frequency ω the dynamical conductivity is given by

[formula]

where [formula] is the current operator. The angular brackets in Eq. [\ref=kubo] denote quantum and thermal averaging, while a positive infinitesimally small δ > 0 guarantees the convergence in the upper limit. Subscripts a,b = x,y correspond to Cartesian components of the current operator [formula]. To simplify the calculations we worked out the expression ([\ref=kubo]) in the limit of vanishing temperature T = 0 and in the absence of disorder (see Fig. [\ref=fig:numerics]). The four vertical lines in Fig. [\ref=fig:wavector] mark frequencies ω-, ωa, ωb and ω+ which select integration area in the calculation of the real part of conductivity tensor for a spin-orbit coupled material (ω-  <  ωa  <  ωb  <  ω+), see Refs. [\cite=Maytorena2006] [\cite=Yudin2016]. A delicate interplay between Rashba and Dresselhaus couplings results in the real part of the conductivity tensor [formula] to be non-zero in a broader region compared to the pure Rashba or Dresselhaus model, limited by ω- and ω+. Meanwhile, the imaginary part is negative in a certain range of the frequencies of the probing field, which may potentially lead to the emergence of TE surface modes [\cite=Falko1989] [\cite=Mikhailov2007]. Therefore, the most important modification arising due to the competition between two different linear spin-orbit interactions compared to the pure Rashba or Dresselhaus system or two-dimensional electron gas stems from the new boundaries of electron-hole continuum, corresponding to Landau damping region characterized by [formula].

The results of numerical calculation of the conductivity tensor illustrating ([\ref=kubo]) are shown by thick blue line in Fig. [\ref=fig:numerics] and can further be used in studying the formation and propagation of surface electromagnetic waves in a spin-orbit coupled system. In numerical calculations we have taken the Rashba coupling [formula] eV·  cm and Dresselhaus constant β = 0.25α. For a given concentration of charge carriers [formula] cm- 2 and the effective mass m = 0.055me (here me is the mass of an electron) the corresponding Fermi energy of two-dimensional electron gas E0  =  πn2 / m  ≈  21.6 meV.

The waveguiding geometry we are going to study in this Letter corresponds to a planar structure placed at z = 0 plain between two dielectric slabs with real permittivities ε+ (at z > 0) and ε- (at z < 0). We consider plane monochromatic wave propagating along x. For this geometry Maxwell equations allow solutions corresponding to two orthogonal polarizations representing TE state with non-zero (Hx,Ey,Hz) and TM state with (Ex,Hy,Ez) respectively. The general solution of the source-free Maxwell equations with boundary conditions: [formula] and [formula] (here [formula] stand for the components of the electric field parallel to the plain of a quantum well) can be searched in the form of a linear superposition of the TE and TM surface modes [\cite=Chiu1974] [\cite=Iorsh2013] [\cite=Yudin2015] [\cite=Kumar2016]:

[formula]

where we assume that the surface waves are characterized by the complex propagation constant q = q(ω) along x axis (its imaginary part accounts for the damping) and λ± are related to q by λ2± = q2  -  ε±k20. For convergent solutions (Reλ± > 0) λ± have meaning of attenuation constants. From the anzatz Eq. [\ref=anzatz] we get:

[formula]

where k0  =  ω / c and c is the speed of light. Eq. [\ref=dispersion] allows solutions in the form of surface waves localized near the plane z = 0 with Reλ± > 0. Consider [formula], i.e. the same dielectric material to the either side of the semiconductor quantum well. Eq. [\ref=dispersion] yields the quadratic equation on λ  =  λ+  =  λ-. In the absence of the right hand side of the Eq. [\ref=dispersion], the two solutions are just TE and TM modes. Presence of the finite off-diagonal components of the conductivity tensor σxy(ω) = σyx(ω) mixes TE and TM modes thus forming hybridized waves. Due to the small value of the conductivity tensor, however, each of the hybridized modes inherits properties of either TE or TM modes and thus can be referred to as hybridized quasi-TE and quasi-TM modes, respectively. The attenuation constants for quasi-TE and quasi-TM modes at ε = 1 are presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:wavector]a,b. The red and blue areas in Fig. [\ref=fig:wavector]a,b mark regions of frequencies where solutions in the form of hybridized waves take a form of surface waves (SW) localized along z exist, i.e. [formula].

The range of frequencies at which hybrid surface waves considered above exist can be tuned all optically by external off-resonant coherent pump of the frequency Ω as we will demonstrate below. In the case of a linearly polarized pump the latter introduces additional anisotropy in the system via renormalization of the parameters of the effective SOI Hamiltonian. In the high-frequency regime the formal derivation of the effective time-independent Hamiltonian can be performed in a rather intuitive way and the rigorous mathematical procedure is based either on Floquet-Magnus expansion [\cite=Casas2001] [\cite=Blanes2009] or Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory [\cite=Mikami2016]: if this is the case, Floquet bands are nearly uncoupled, while the corresponding Floquet Hamiltonian becomes almost block-diagonal, which results in very weak dependence on time of the effective Floquet operator. Nevertheless, for a driven quantum system the validity of such derived effective Hamiltonian is restricted to the frequency of driving being the dominant energy scale in the system. The new boundaries of electron-hole continuum ω± can be interpreted as photon maximal and minimal energies required to induce optical transition between spin split subbands. The absorption bandwidth δω  =  ω+  -  ω- has therefore to satisfy δω  ≪  Ω to validate the use of high-frequency expansion.

In the current work we solve directly the evolution equation that governs the dynamics of Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupled electron gas under intense linearly polarized field (for more details see Appendix). We start by developing a description of off-resonant pumping in a generic spin-orbit coupled system. The time-dependence is introduced to the Hamiltonian via electromagnetic vector potential [formula] of the external driving [formula] of frequency Ω and electric field strength E0; the driven field is assumed to be linearly polarized along y axis, [formula]. The conducting properties of two-dimensional spin-orbit coupled electron gas were extensively studied in the past [\cite=Schliemann2003a] [\cite=Maytorena2006], however the regime of strong light-matter coupling with an external field has so far completely avoided attention in spite of its particular importance for the design of nanophotonics integrated circuits. The renormalized SOI Hamiltonian can be cast in the following form: [\cite=Sheremet2016] [\cite=Yudin2016]

[formula]

where the renormalized values

[formula]

and

[formula]

are determined by light-matter coupling constant (J0 stands for Bessel function of zeroth order)

[formula]

As off-resonant pumping renormalizes the parameters of the Hamiltonian, it should also affect conductivities as shown at the Fig. [\ref=fig:numerics] by green, orange and red lines corresponding to the light-matter coupling strengths γ = 0.4,0.6 and 0.8, respectively. The effect of the pumping on the hybrid waves is shown at the Fig. [\ref=fig:wavector]c,d. Note, that the interval of the frequencies where solutions in the form of the surface waves exist can be controlled by changing the intensity of the driving field as it is demonstrated at the Fig. [\ref=fig:wavector]e.

To summarize, in this Letter we showed that 2D Rashba-Dresselhaus material supports the propagation of the hybridized TE-TM surface waves. We calculated propagation and attenuation constants and showed how the range of existence of hybridized TE-TM surface waves can be controlled all optically by external coherent pumping.

Appendix: Derivation of the Hamiltonian [formula]

In this appendix we provide derivation of the effective time-independent Hamiltonian given by ([\ref=spinorbit]). We assume two-dimensional electron characterized by both Rahsba and Dresselhaus SOI is driven out of equilibrium by a linearly polarized field [formula] of the frequency Ω and electric field strength E0. The field induces time-dependence to the Hamiltonian ([\ref=so])

[formula]

via the minimal coupling [formula]. With the help of a unitary transformation

[formula]

where γ denotes the effective dimensionless light-matter coupling determined by ([\ref=lm]), and tan ξ  =  β  /  α defines the relative strength of SOI, we derive

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula]. Remarkably, the exponential of trigonometric function in A(t) is simplified when applying Jacobi-Anger expansion: [formula], where Jn(z) is the n - th order Bessel function of the first kind. If we restrict ourselves to off-resonant case exclusively, which means that the frequency of a driving Ω  ≫  δω exceeds the absorption bandwidth, we can neglect higher order harmonics and keep J0(z) only. The Hamiltonian H in the basis in which σz is diagonal can be rewritten in a similar fashion as the initial Hamiltonian ([\ref=in]), namely

[formula]

which is formally true as long as the argument of J0(2γ) is far away from the nulls of the Bessel function. The renormalized couplings [formula] and [formula] are determined by ([\ref=r]) and ([\ref=d]) respectively.
