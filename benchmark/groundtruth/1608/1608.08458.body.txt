Exotic Higgs Decay h  →  φφ  →  4b at the LHeC

Introduction

The discovery of the 125 GeV Higgs boson (denoted as h)  [\cite=Chatrchyan:2012ufa] [\cite=Aad:2012tfa] not only deepens our understanding of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking but also opens new avenues for searching for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) which is required to clarify the unexplained theoretical and observational issues such as the problem of naturalness, the existence of dark matter and the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe. One of such avenues is exotic Higgs decay, which is only loosely constrained by Higgs signal strength measurements. The combination of ATLAS and CMS Run I results constrains undetected Higgs decay branching ratio to be smaller than about 34% at 95% C.L. assuming [formula] [\cite=Khachatryan:2016vau](κV denotes hVV(V = W,Z) coupling strength relative to SM assuming [formula]). The ultimate sensitivity on undetected Higgs decay branching ratio via indirect measurements at the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) is estimated to be O(5 - 10%) [\cite=Curtin:2013fra]. On the other hand, due to the expected extremely narrow width of the Higgs boson, even a rather weak coupling between it and any new light degrees of freedom can naturally induce a sizable exotic decay branching fraction. One such possibility is h  →  φφ, where φ denotes a light spin-0 particle, with mass less than about 62.5 GeV so that this decay channel is kinematically allowed. φ can be CP-even or CP-odd, or even a CP-mixed state. If its mass is greater than 2mb, then in most models which approximately obey Yukawa ordering φ will mainly decay to b. This decay channel is well motivated in a wide class of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) theories [\cite=Curtin:2013fra], such as the Next to Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM), Higgs singlet extension of the SM, general extended Higgs sector models [\cite=Mao:2016jor], and Little Higgs Models. Quite a few phenomenology studies already exist with respect to this channel at the LHC [\cite=Cao:2013gba] [\cite=Cheung:2007sva] [\cite=Carena:2007jk] [\cite=Kaplan:2011vf] [\cite=Kaplan:2009qt], with or without using jet substructure techniques. Due to large QCD backgrounds in gluon fusion and vector boson fusion channels, the LHC searches generally focus on the VH associated production channel. However this channel suffers from large top quark backgrounds. A recent ATLAS analysis [\cite=Aaboud:2016oyb] using 3.2 ~  -  1 [formula] data made the first attempt to constrain this channel using WH associated production but the sensitivity is currently quite weak (even [formula] cannot be constrained assuming κV = 1).

The not-so-clean hadron-hadron collision environment motivates us to consider better places to search for this exotic Higgs decay channel. Here we consider using the Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC) [\cite=AbelleiraFernandez:2012cc] to explore h  →  φφ  →  4b. The LHeC is a proposed lepton-hadron collider which is designed to collide a [formula] electron beam with the [formula] proton beam of the HL-LHC. It is supposed to run synchronously with the HL-LHC may deliver an integrated luminosity as high as 1000 ~  -  1 [\cite=Bruening:2013bga]. The electron beam may have - 0.9 polarization [\cite=Bruening:2013bga]. It is worth noticing that with such high collision energy and luminosity, the LHeC indeed becomes a Higgs boson factory [\cite=Bruening:2013bga]. With Higgs boson production cross section of about 200 ~  -  1, the LHeC will provide amazing opportunities for precision Higgs physics, due to the fact that major QCD backgrounds will be much smaller than LHC and the complication due to pile-up will be greatly reduced. Previous studies on Higgs physics at the LHeC include measuring bottom Yukawa coupling [\cite=Jarlskog:1990dv] [\cite=Han:2009pe] [\cite=AbelleiraFernandez:2012cc], anomalous gauge-Higgs coupling [\cite=Biswal:2012mp] [\cite=Cakir:2013bxa] [\cite=Senol:2012fc], invisible Higgs decay [\cite=Tang:2015uha] and MSSM Higgs production [\cite=Zhe:2011yr]. Studies on charm Yukawa measurements has been reported in  [\cite=Klein:2015hcc]. The impact of double Higgs production at the higher energy ep collider FCC-he on Higgs-self coupling measurement has also been studied [\cite=Kumar:2015tua] [\cite=Kumar:2015kca].

To quantitatively estimate the sensitivity of the LHeC to the exotic Higgs decay h  →  φφ  →  4b, we perform a parton level study for the signal and background in the next section. The signal definition depends on the required number of b-tagged jets. Here for simplicity and a clear identification of signal we require tagging at least 4 b - tagged jets. We provide the expected LHeC sensitivity for φ mass between [formula] and [formula] and investigate the robustness of our results under variation of b-tagging performance and pseudorapidity coverage. We also translate our results into the expected exclusion power in the parameter space of the Higgs singlet extension of the SM. In the last section we present our discussion and conclusion.

Collider Sensitivity

The exotic Higgs dacay h  →  φφ  →  4b can be simply characterized by the following effective interaction Lagrangian for a new real scalar degree of freedom φ,

[formula]

In the above [formula]. λh and λb are real dimensionless parameters and [formula] denotes the part of Lagrangian which mediates the decay of φ into final states other than b. The part of Lagrangian [formula] has been taken as CP-even without loss of generality. New physics may also modify hVV(V = W,Z) coupling which affects the Higgs production rate and kinematics. We assume the hVV(V = W,Z) coupling is purely CP-even. Assuming narrow width approximation is valid for both h and φ, we can express the collider reach for h  →  φφ  →  4b via the following quantity

[formula]

for a given value of the φ mass mφ.

There are two major Higgs production channels at the LHeC: charged current (CC) and neutral current (NC). Due to the accidentally suppressed electron NC coupling, NC Higgs cross section is much less than that of CC [\cite=Han:2009pe]. Therefore in the following we only focus on CC process, although in a more detailed analysis the NC process should also be included to enhance the overall statistical significance.

The signal process of CC Higgs production is

[formula]

The corresponding Feynman diagram is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:cc_sig]. The signal signature thus contains at least 5 jets (in which at least 4 jets are b-tagged) plus missing transverse energy.

The backgrounds can be classified into charged current (CC) backgrounds which have genuine [formula] in the final state and photoproduction (PP) backgrounds which produce [formula] due to jet energy mismeasurement. All PP backgrounds can be easily suppressed to a negligible fraction as long as we require a certain amount of [formula]. The CC backgrounds can be further classified according to the number of heavy resonances (W,Z,t,h) produced which further decay to result in a large number of b-tagged jets. We found that if in one process the number of heavy resonances involved is greater than or equal to two, then its contribution to the total background is always negligible. Therefore in the following we only consider the following backgrounds: CC multijet, CC W + jets, CC Z + jets, CC t + jets, CC h + jets. Here "multijet" and "jets" contain jets of all flavor (g,u,d,s,c,b). Higgs decay to 4b via SM processes is also included as a background, in CC h +  jets. Fig. [\ref=fig:bkggraph] displays representative Feynman diagrams for these background processes.

To simulate the signal and backgrounds, we implement the effective interaction in Eq. [\eqref=eqn:Leff] into FeynRules [\cite=Alloul:2013bka]. The generated model file together with the SM is then imported by MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [\cite=Alwall:2014hca]. The Higgs boson mass is taken to be [formula]. The φ mass is scanned in the region [formula] with [formula] step size. The collider parameter is taken to be [formula] with electron beam being - 0.9 polarized. The signal and background samples are generated by MadGraph5_aMC@NLO at leading order with NNPDF2.3 LO PDF [\cite=Ball:2013hta] and the renormalization and factorization scale is set dynamically by MadGraph default. The NLO QCD correction to the signal process are known to be small [\cite=Jager:2010zm]. In the following we take all the signal and background K-factors to be 1 although we expect the correct background normalization could be obtained from data. We apply jet energy smearing according to the following energy resolution formula

[formula]

where [formula] [\cite=AbelleiraFernandez:2012cc]. We consider the following four scenarios of b - tagging performance in pseudorapidity range |η| < 5 and jet [formula]: (εb denotes the efficiency of b - jet, while εc and εg,u,d,s denote the faking probability of c - jet and g,u,d,s - jet respectively)

εb = 70%,εc = 10%,εg,u,d,s = 1%

εb = 70%,εc = 20%,εg,u,d,s = 1%

εb = 60%,εc = 10%,εg,u,d,s = 1%

εb = 60%,εc = 20%,εg,u,d,s = 1%

Event analysis is performed by MadAnalysis 5 [\cite=Conte:2012fm].

The event selection in the 4b-tagging case first require at least five jets satisfying the following basic cuts:

[formula]

Events with additional charged leptons are vetoed. To suppress the photoproduction background, we require:

[formula]

Then we impose the 4b-tagging requirement:

[formula]

The 4 b-tagged jets which have the closest invariant mass to mh are required to have their invariant mass m4b lie in the following mass window:

[formula]

Finally we utilize the event structure of the signal: for the 4 b - tagged jets picked out in the previous step, we group them into two pairs such that the absolute value of the invariant mass difference between these two pairs is smallest among all grouping possibilities. Then we require the invariant masses of these b - jet pairs both lie in the following mass window:

[formula]

Here m2b,i,i = 1,2 denote the invariant mass of the two "correctly" grouped b - jet pairs, respectively.

We present cut flow tables (Table [\ref=table:cutflow20], Table [\ref=table:cutflow40], Table [\ref=table:cutflow60]) for three benchmark masses [formula] under b - tagging performance scenario [\eqref=eqn:ba]. Only CC backgrounds are listed because PP backgrounds are negligible due to the [formula] requirement. For the decay of t,W,Z in backgrounds, the following two cases are both considered and included in our results. One is the decay to a minimal number of partons, i.e. t  →  bqq,W  →  qq,Z  →  qq, with each parton identified as one jet. The other case is that one additional b pair is radiated from the decay products of t,W,Z. For t + jets the second kind of process is found to contribute sizably to the total background. For the h + jets background, only h  →  bb and h  →  4b via tree-level SM processes are considered. Due to limited Monte Carlo statistics, there are slight differences among the three tables for the first four cuts on backgrounds. From the tables it can be concluded that the h  →  φφ  →  4b channel at the LHeC is almost background free-with 100 ~  -  1 luminosity the expected number of background is at most O(0.1) while the remaining signal cross section is [formula] for C24b = 1. This is in stark contrast with the situation at the (HL-)LHC where the signal is buried in large top quark backgrounds.

Fig. [\ref=fig:cls1] shows the expected 95% CLs [\cite=Read:2000ru] [\cite=Read:2002hq] exclusion limits and 5σ discovery reach at the LHeC for the C24b quantity in the mass range [formula] assuming 100 ~  -  1 and 1 ~  -  1 luminosity. Various b - tagging performance scenarios are considered in the plots, all assuming a b - tagging pseudorapidity coverage |η| < 5. Because the expected number of background events is quite small, in setting exclusion limits and discovery reach we use exact formulae of the Poisson distribution for a discrete random variable. This leads to some small discontinuities at certain mφ values when the expected limits/reach are interpreted as the limits/reach for the median of background-only or signal plus background hypothesis, as can be seen from the plots.

From Fig. [\ref=fig:cls1] it can be easily seen that for mφ in the [formula] range the LHeC with 100 ~  -  1 luminosity is capable of probing C24b to a few percent level while with 1 ~  -  1 luminosity the LHeC will eventually probe C24b down to a few per milli level, both at 95% CLs. For [formula], the 95% CLs upper limit on C24b is about 0.3%,0.2%,0.1% respectively, for b - tagging scenario [\eqref=eqn:ba]. The result is generally insensitive to mistag rates of c - jets, because with the requirement of at least 4 b - tagged jets, fake backgrounds do not contribute much to the total background. On the other hand the final signal rate is approximately proportional to the fourth power of the b - tagging efficiency, thus it will be relatively important to maintain a high b - tagging efficiency to retain more signal events. As can be expected, the sensitivity drops quickly when mφ becomes smaller than about [formula] due to the collimation of φ decay products that renders the resolved analysis inefficient. A jet substructure analysis is needed to improve the sensitivity in this mass region, which we leave for future study.

Fig. [\ref=fig:cls2] also shows the expected 95% CLs exclusion limits and 5σ discovery reach at the LHeC for the C24b quantity in the mass range [formula] assuming 100 ~  -  1 and 1 ~  -  1 luminosity. Here b - tagging performance is fixed to scenario [\eqref=eqn:ba] but various b - tagging pseudorapidity coverage conditions are considered. The plots indicate that the sensitivity reach of the LHeC for this channel is not very sensitive to b - tagging pseudorapidity coverage.

We now consider the interpretation of the expected sensitivity of the LHeC in the context of Higgs singlet extension of the SM. For simplicity we consider the Higgs singlet extension studied in  [\cite=Robens:2015gla]. In this model, an additional real singlet scalar S is added to the SM. The Lagrangian of the Higgs kinetic and potential terms is extended to the following form:

[formula]

with scalar potential

[formula]

Here Φ denotes the original SM Higgs doublet. The scalar potential obeys a Z2 symmetry. We allow S to acquire vacuum expectation value and express the Higgs fields in unitary gauge as

[formula]

Here [formula] ensures the correct mass generation for W,Z bosons and SM fermions. The gauge eigenstates h̃,h' can be related to mass eigenstates φ,h via an orthogonal rotation

[formula]

Now it is convenient to parameterize the model in terms of five more physical quantities: (mφ,mh are masses of φ and h respectively)

[formula]

The translation formulae between these quantities and original parameters in the Lagrangian can be found in  [\cite=Robens:2015gla]. We are interested in the case in which the additional Higgs boson is lighter, therefore we fix [formula] and allow three parameters mφ,α, tan β to vary. Here we focus on the more interesting region where sin α  →   - 1 which also allows for a special direction tan β =  -  cot α that results in a vanishing [formula] [\cite=Robens:2015gla]. We consider three benchmark values of mφ ([formula]) and plot the current LEP and LHC constraints and future HL-LHC and LHeC constraints on the tan β  -   sin α plane, see Fig. [\ref=fig:hse]. Each point is colored according to its C24b value for reference. The factor [formula] appeared in C24b definition Eq. [\eqref=eqn:c4b2] is almost at a constant value 0.77 in the mass range [formula]  [\cite=Curtin:2014pda]. The LEP constraints (green dashed line) come from direct search for additional Higgs bosons and is taken directly from  [\cite=Robens:2015gla]. Points on the right side of the green dashed line is excluded at 95% confidence level. This indicates that LEP search forces the mixing between two Higgses to be very small for the scenario in which there is a light Higgs boson in the mass range ([formula]). In such a case there cannot be sizable deviation of Higgs signal strength due to Higgs mixing. However, the opening of exotic Higgs decay h  →  φφ could lead to siazble suppression of [formula] Higgs signal strengths. The LHC Run I constraints (white real line) come from the [formula] Higgs signal strength measurements [\cite=Khachatryan:2016vau]. The region between the two white real line for [formula] (and the region below the white real line for [formula] case) is allowed by LHC Run I measurements at 2σ level. We translated the HL-LHC projection of the precision of Higgs signal strength measurements [\cite=ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-016] into constraints (yellow real line "HL-LHC ind.") on the parameter space of the Higgs singlet extension of the SM (assuming half theoretical uncertainties, according to  [\cite=ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-016]). At the (HL-)LHC, h  →  φφ  →  4b can be directly probed via Wh associated production, as has been done by ATLAS [\cite=Aaboud:2016oyb]. However, current constraint from this method is quite weak and even C24b = 1 cannot be bound. We extrapolate the current constraint [\cite=Aaboud:2016oyb] to 3 ~  -  1 HL-LHC, with a very optimistic assumption that all selection efficiency can be maintained and all systematic uncertainties scale with the square root of luminosity. The corresponding 95% CLs exclusion limits is plotted as yellow dotted line "HL-LHC dir.(opt.)". It can be seen that even with this very optimistic assumption the sensitivity of the direct search from Wh channel is at most comparable to the indirect constraint from the HL-LHC [formula] Higgs signal strength measurements. The LHeC 1 ~  -  1 95% CLs sensitivity is plotted as the red real lines and the LHeC is expected to exclude region outside the red real lines if no new physics exists. It is obvious that the LHeC exclusion capability extends to the deep black region which represents very small C24b values. If no lepton colliders are available before the end of the HL-LHC, much of the parameter space of the Higgs singlet extension model could only be reached via the ep machine.

Discussion and Conclusion

In this paper we studied the LHeC sensitivity to the exotic Higgs decay process h  →  φφ  →  4b in which φ denotes a spin-0 particle lighter than half of [formula]. We performed a parton level analysis and showed that with 1 ~  -  1 luminosity the LHeC is able to exclude C24b at a fer per mille level, when only statistical uncertities are included. To maintain the sensitivity, it is important to choose a b - tagging working point with relatively large b - tagging efficiency. The sensitivity is not very sensitive to the variation of b - tagging pseudorapidity coverage from 3 to 5. Using the Higgs singlet extension of the SM as an illustration, we showed that the LHeC direct search of h  →  φφ  →  4b is the most sensitive probe of much of the parameter space of the model in the future, if no lepton colliders are available. Of course this LHeC search will also deliver significant impacts on the scalar sector of other BSM theories when one of the scalar boson lies in the mass range
