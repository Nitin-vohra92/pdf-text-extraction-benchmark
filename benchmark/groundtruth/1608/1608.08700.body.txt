The Künneth formula for the twisted de Rham and Higgs cohomologies

The main statement

Let U be a smooth quasi-projective variety over the field [formula] of complex numbers, and [formula] a regular function. Attached to such a pair (U,f) and a non-negative integer k, one has the k-th de Rham cohomology [formula] and Higgs cohomology [formula]. The two spaces [formula], are of the same finite dimension over [formula] (see [\cite=ESY]), and are equipped with the decreasing irregular Hodge filtrations

[formula]

indexed by the ordered set [formula] of rational numbers with finitely many jumps. In the following, we omit the adjective and just call them the Hodge filtrations. For the motivations and the basic properties of the Hodge filtration, including in particular the degeneration of the Hodge to de Rham spectral sequence, see [\cite=ESY] [\cite=KKP] and the references therein. We recall the construction in §[\ref=sect:Fil].

Now consider two such pairs (Ui,fi),i = 1,2. On the product U: = U1  ×  U2, consider the regular function f defined by f(x1,x2): = f1(x1)  +  f2(x2) where xi∈Ui. We call the pair (U,f) the product of the two (Ui,fi). For [formula], there is the canonical map

[formula]

induced by cup product. We equip the space on the left hand side with the product filtration, i.e. the λ-th filtration for [formula] is given by the subspace

[formula]

where the inner sum is taken inside [formula]. In this article, we prove the following Künneth formula.

In particular, denoting [formula] the λ-th graded piece of a filtered space (V,F), one has the identification

[formula]

The rest of the article begins in §[\ref=sect:Fil] with a brief of the construction of the Hodge filtration. We follow the approach of [\cite=Y] by putting a filtration on the de Rham complex or the Higgs complex via a certain compactification of the pair (U,f). Here we introduce the notion of a non-degenerate compactification, which is weaker than that of a good compactification used in [\cite=Y], but appears naturally in the later section (see also [\cite=S], [\cite=SY], [\cite=M_GKZ]). In order to compare the cohomologies with the filtrations of the summands (Ui,fi) and of their product (U,f), we construct a particular compactification of (U,f) from the fixed ones of (Ui,fi) in §[\ref=sect:Resolution]. The proof of the Künneth formula is obtained by a careful investigation of the relations between the involved complexes on the compactifications. In the last §[\ref=sect:BL], we remark that one can interpolate the two spaces [formula] and [formula] as the fibers of the Kontsevich bundle on the projective line [formula] over 1 and 0, respectively. In fact, the fiber over c  ≠  0,  ∞   is equal to [formula] and hence the Künneth formula also holds true. However at ∞   the situation is more complicated in this regard and the direct analogue of the Künneth formula does not hold in general.

The filtrations

In this section, we fix a pair (U,f) consisting of a smooth quasi-projective variety U over [formula] and a regular function [formula].

The compactification

Let X be a projective variety over [formula] containing U such that the reduced subvariety [formula] is a normal crossing divisor. Regard [formula] as a rational function on X. Let P and Z be the pole divisor and the zero divisor of f on X, respectively, and let [formula] be the support of P.

Definition. (i) We call X a non-degenerate compactification of (U,f) if there exists a neighborhood V  ⊂  X of P such that [formula] is smooth and [formula] forms a reduced normal crossing divisor on V.

(ii) We call X a good compactification of (U,f) if f indeed defines a morphism [formula].

The non-degenerate compactification appears in the considerations of rescaling from a good compactification (see [\cite=SY]), and of Fourier transform (see [\cite=S]). It is discussed in [\cite=M_GKZ] where in this situation, the author calls f non-degenerate along S ([\cite=M_GKZ]). See also [\cite=Y] in the case where f is a Laurent polynomial.

If X is non-degenerate, analytically locally at a point of P, there exists a coordinate system

[formula]

such that

[formula]

(Here and after, we use the standard multi-index convention.) If X is good, the second case does not occur.

The filtered complexes

Fix a non-degenerate compactification X of (U,f) with boundary S. Regard f as a rational function on X and let P  =  f*(  ∞  ) be the pole divisor with multiplicities. We have [formula].

Definition. (i) The twisted de Rham complex and the Higgs complex are the complexes

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula], respectively. Here [formula] sends a local section ω to [formula].

(ii) We call the associated hypercohomology groups [formula] the de Rham cohomology and the Higgs cohomology of (U,f), and denote respectively by

[formula]

(iii) For an effective divisor D on X and [formula], let

[formula]

For [formula], let

[formula]

The subindex X in [formula] will be omitted if the base variety is clear. The Hodge filtrations of the de Rham and the Higgs cohomologies are

[formula]

induced by the inclusions of complexes.

(iv) For [formula], the Kontsevich sheaf of differential p-forms is the coherent subsheaf of ΩpX( log S)( * P)

[formula]

and it forms the Kontsevich complex [formula] equipped with the filtration [formula] by direct truncation. We simply write Ωpf for Ωpf(0).

Proof.  Both statements are local properties for coherent sheaves on X and we can restrict to the coordinates such that [\eqref=eq:non-deg-local] holds.

In case [formula], the local freeness and the quasi-isomorphisms are obtained in [\cite=ESY], [\cite=KKP] and [\cite=Y], [\cite=ESY], respectively. In fact, the methods are similar to the arguments below.

Consider the second case [formula] so that [formula]. In this chart, the [formula]-module ΩpX( log S) is freely generated by

[formula]

and

[formula]

The [formula]-module Ωpf(α) is indeed freely generated by

[formula]

where ω1 and ω2 run through elements in [\eqref=eq:with-df] and [\eqref=eq:without-df], respectively.

Let E be an irreducible component of [formula] and

[formula]

To obtain the quasi-isomorphisms, it suffices to show that the inclusion of complexes

[formula]

is a quasi-isomorphism for any k,α. For this, we may assume that E  =  (x1) in the local model. Consider local sections [formula], and ω1 and ω2 in [\eqref=eq:with-df] and [\eqref=eq:without-df], respectively. Then {h  ·  x-  ⌊(α + p)e⌋x- k1ωi} generates Apk(α) and

[formula]

Therefore the quotient [formula] of [\eqref=eq:extended] is exact. [formula]

Remark. By [\cite=SY], the filtered complex [formula] is quasi-isomorphic to the filtered de Rham complex of the [formula]-module attached to [formula] with an irregular Hodge filtration given in [\cite=SY]. When X is a good compactification, this is discussed in [\cite=ESY].

The independence

Proof.  The assertion for good compactifications is proved in [\cite=Y], by comparing the degree p components [formula] of [formula] on various X for a fixed p (and hence the proof works for both [formula] and [formula]).

In the following we show that by performing successively certain blowups, one can replace a non-degenerate compactification X (thus in the second case of [\eqref=eq:non-deg-local]) by a good one and compare the involved chain complexes (c.f. [\cite=Y]). Let [formula] be the blowup along the intersection Ξ of Z  =  (z1) and the irreducible component (x1) of P with multiplicity e1. Let E be the exceptional divisor, [formula] and [formula] the pole divisor of : = ϖ*f. We want to establish that [formula] and [formula] are canonically quasi-isomorphic.

In case e1 > 1, it can be proved as [\cite=Y]. In more details, write λ  =    -  α + p where 0  ≤  α < 1 and [formula]. On [formula] define the complex

[formula]

We have

[formula]

By [\cite=Y], each component of the complex [formula] is a direct sum of copies of [formula]. Hence the adjunction [formula] is a quasi-isomorphism. On the other hand, there are increasing complexes [formula] on [formula] (those denoted by [formula] in [\cite=Y], which is a complex under either [formula] or [formula]) with [formula] and [formula] such that [formula] is quasi-isomorphic to the complex consisting of a direct sum of copies of [formula] concentrated at degree p + q. In fact, in [\cite=Y], we further introduce the complexes [formula] and prove the inclusion [formula] is a quasi-isomorphism by showing the quotient complex is exact. However on the quotient, one has the equality [formula] of the differential maps under the condition e1 > 1 and [formula] is indeed also stable under [formula]. Therefore the proof of [\cite=Y] describing [formula] goes through in both cases [formula] and [formula] and one obtains that the inclusion [formula] induces a quasi-isomorphism [formula].

The following arguments work for any e1  ≥  1 and simplify those in [\cite=Y]. (Cf., [\cite=KKP].) By Prop.[\ref=Prop:Kont-Log], it suffices to show that for any [formula], the inclusion [formula] on [formula] induces an isomorphism [formula] on X. Explicitly the blowup [formula] is defined by the equation [formula] in [formula] where

[formula]

The proof of the main result

We begin with two pairs (Ui,fi),i = 1,2, and their product (U,f). Fix good compactifications Xi of (Ui,fi) such that [formula] are strict normal crossing divisors. The proof of Thm.[\ref=Thm:Kunneth] consists of two steps. In the first step §[\ref=sect:elim], we construct explicitly a non-degenerate compactification X of (U,f) from X1  ×  X2 by successive blowups. In step two §[\ref=sect:relations], we compare the filtered de Rham or the Higgs complex on X, which gives the Hodge filtration on [formula], with a certain filtered complex on X1  ×  X2 that gives the product filtration using the explicit construction of X.

An explicit elimination

For each i = 1,2, take an open covering of Xi with a system of local coordinates

[formula]

such that

[formula]

As for the initial data in the inductive construction, we consider the compactification X1  ×  X2 of U with the systems of local coordinates {xi,j}.

Suppose we have constructed a compactification Y of U and its systems of local coordinates

[formula]

together with a birational map π:Y  →  X1  ×  X2 such that

[formula]

for some a,b  ≥  0 with bi > 0 if ai  =  0. Let T be the boundary divisor [formula]. For a pair of irreducible components D1,D2 of T, set

[formula]

Notice that if ΔY(D1,D2)  ≥  0 for any pair (D1,D2), i.e., a  ≥  b or b  ≥  a in terms of the systems of local coordinates as above, then the zero divisor of π*f is smooth in a neighborhood of T and intersects T transversally. Thus Y is a non-degenerate compactification of (U,f).

Otherwise, pick a pair (D1,D2) such that ΔY(D1,D2) < 0 and is the smallest among all possible values of ΔY. Let [formula] be the blowup of Y along [formula] and [formula] the induced map. Then [formula] consists of the exceptional divisor E and [formula] where [formula] denotes the proper transform of an irreducible component D of T. To construct the explicit systems of local coordinates of [formula], we may assume that Di  =  (yi) for i = 1,2 with a1  >  b1 and a2  <  b2 after rearrangement. The blowup is defined by the equation y1v = y2u where

[formula]

Relations between complexes

We shall put a filtered complex on each step of the sequence of blowups constructed in §[\ref=sect:elim] and compare them under push-forwards.

Consider a birational map π:Y  →  X1  ×  X2 and let PY,fj be the pole divisor of the pullback of fj on Y. For any [formula], consider the subsheaf [formula] of [formula] given by

[formula]

which is coherent but not locally free in general. Let [formula] and

[formula]

For [formula], consider the complex on Y

[formula]

where

[formula]

(It is indeed a sub-complex of [formula].)

At the final step Y  =  X of the blowups, X is a non-degenerate compactification of (U,f) and F(λ)Y(Θ) is indeed the filtration defining the desired Hodge filtration. The following two lemmas describe the situations in the initial step Y  =  X1  ×  X2 and in each blowup [formula] appeared in the sequence occurred in §[\ref=sect:elim], respectively.

Consider Y  =  X1  ×  X2 and let [formula] be the product filtration of [formula] whose p-th component is

[formula]

inside ΩpY( * T). (Here [formula] and [formula] if [formula] and [formula], respectively.)

The filtration F(λ)Y(Θ) coincides with [formula].

One has

[formula]

where the inner sum is taken inside the vector space [formula].

Proof.  (i) Indeed the inclusion [formula] is clear. Conversely suppose that μ: = p - λ > 0. The p-th degree component Ωp,(μ)Y of F(λ)Y(Θ) is generated by products of elements in

[formula]

which are the q-th and the (p - q)-th components of Fq - (1 - θ)μX1(Θ1) and Fp - q - θμX2(Θ2), respectively. The latter two contribute to [formula].

(ii) We have the natural external products

[formula]

for all a + b  =  λ. Using ech resolution or representatives in smooth forms, one obtains the cup product

[formula]

One the other hand, one has from the definition that

[formula]

Again there is the cup product

[formula]

Therefore to complete the assertion, it suffices to show that the arrow above is an isomorphism, which can be obtained by directly truncating the involved complexes and inductively using the Künneth formula for coherent sheaves [\cite=SW]. [formula]

Let [formula] be the blowup constructed in §[\ref=sect:elim]. Then the pullback ϖ*F(λ)Y(Θ) is a sub-complex of [formula] and the following hold.

Each component [formula] of the quotient is supported on the exceptional divisor E and is a direct sum of copies of relative [formula] of the [formula]-bundle E over the center of the blowup ϖ.

We have the canonical quasi-isomorphism [formula].

Proof.  (i) Let [formula]. Again assume that μ: = p - λ  ≥  0. Since [formula], we only need to consider the difference between [formula] and [formula]. We use the local coordinates [\eqref=eq:Y_LocCoor] with the properties [\eqref=eq:Y_LocBeh]. Then [formula] is generated by various

[formula]

where c  =  (1 - θ)μa  +  θμb for 0  ≤  θ  ≤  1. On the other hand, [formula] is generated by various

[formula]

on the two charts [\eqref=eq:Yv_LocCoor] and [\eqref=eq:Yu_LocCoor] satisfying [\eqref=eq:Yv_LocBeh] and [\eqref=eq:Yu_LocBeh], respectively. We have

[formula]

and similarly on the chart u  ≠  0. Observe on the intersection that [formula] if ⌊c1 + c2⌋  ≠  ⌊c1⌋  +  ⌊c2⌋. Thus [formula] is a direct sum of copies of the relative [formula].

(ii) There are only finitely many y-  ⌊c⌋ occurred in the generators in [\eqref=eq:g_Gen]; call the appeared (distinct) monomials [formula] ordered by the increment of the corresponding parameter θ. Consider locally the filtration [formula] of [formula]-submodules of [formula]. On this chart one has the short exact sequence

[formula]

Here if [formula], then ci,j is monotone as a function of i and [formula] is the invertible sheaf generated by

[formula]

(with diagonal embedding to [formula]). Applying inductively the projection formula to the locally free [formula] and Ni, one obtains that

[formula]

since [formula] for the birational morphism ϖ. Together with the computation in (i), the assertion follows. [formula]

The proof of the main theorem [\ref=Thm:Kunneth] is now completed by the above two lemmas.

The Brieskorn lattice

We indicate that the Künneth formula for [formula] and [formula] can be put together into a family version (cf., [\cite=SY], [\cite=KKP] and [\cite=M_Kont]).

Consider the affine line [formula] with a fixed coordinate u.

Fix a pair (U,f) and a non-degenerate compactification X. Let [formula] be the projection. The k-th Brieskorn lattice of (U,f) (cf., [\cite=SY]) is the coherent sheaf on [formula]

[formula]

Here [formula] is the derivative with respective to the component X only.

Let

[formula]

According to the quasi-isomorphisms in Prop.[\ref=Prop:Kont-Log](ii) and the E1-degeneration

[formula]

the [formula]-module [formula] is free and independent of the choice of α, and the canonical maps [formula] indeed define a filtration by free subsheaves of [formula] with free quotients whose fibers are

[formula]

under the base-change map (cf. the arguments in the proof of [\cite=ESY]).

Now consider as in §[\ref=sect:Resolution] two pairs (Ui,fi) and their product (U,f). We again have the natural map

[formula]

obtained by cup product. Similar to the proof of [\cite=ESY], the fiber-wise Künneth formula Thm.[\ref=Thm:Kunneth] shows that the above map is an isomorphism strictly compatible with the filtrations.

On the other hand, fix 0  ≤  α < 1. One can naturally complete [formula] into a filtered bundle on [formula] by adding the filtered cohomology space

[formula]

as the fiber over u  =    ∞  . The resulting sheaf on [formula] is called the Kontsevich bundle and denoted by [formula]. The filtered space [formula] depends on α but does not depend on the choice of the non-degenerate compactification X since in fact ([\cite=SY], [\cite=M_Kont])

the bundle [formula] can be obtained (as a Deligne extension) by using a natural algebraic connection on [formula] (see [\cite=SY] with the aid of Prop.[\ref=Prop:Kont-Log](ii) in the case of non-degenerate compactification X) with regular singularity at u =   ∞  , and

under the base-change, one has

[formula]

where [formula] is the Harder-Narasimhan filtration on the locally free sheaf [formula] normalized with [formula] isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of [formula] on [formula].

However, one does not have the direct analogue of the Künneth formula for [formula] in general. For example, in the case [formula] where x is a global coordinate on the affine line [formula], one has

[formula]

and the cup product

[formula]

is zero.
