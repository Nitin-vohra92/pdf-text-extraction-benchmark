On Weyl's embedding problem in Riemannian manifolds

Introduction

Weyl's embedding problem is a classic isometric embedding problem in differential geometry. It was raised by Weyl [\cite=W] in 1916. The problem concerns the realization of [formula] with positive Gauss curvature as a convex surface in 3-dimentional Euclidean space.

In the case that g is analytic, it was solved by Lewy in [\cite=L]. In the smooth case, Weyl's problem was fully resolved by Nirenberg in a milestone paper [\cite=N], under conditions that g∈C4 and Gauss curvature Kg > 0. In order to reduce the regularity assumption on g, Heinz [\cite=H1] [\cite=H2] developed the interior C2 estimate for the embedding. This allows him to solve the problem under the condition g∈C3. This method was further modified by Schulz to relax the condition to g∈C2,α, see in [\cite=S]. In the degenerate case Kg  ≥  0, Weyl's problem was studied by Guan-Li [\cite=GL] and Hong-Zuily [\cite=HZ], see also [\cite=I].

In the case of hyperbolic space [formula], Weyl's problem was solved by Pogorelov [\cite=P] under conditions that g∈C4 and Kg >  - 1. The degenerate case Kg  ≥   - 1 was studied by Lin-Wang [\cite=WL] recently, see also early results by Chang-Xiao [\cite=CX].

For general ambient space other than space form, Pogorelov established isometric embedding of a convex surface [formula] into (N,) under certain conditions on sectional curvatures of the ambient space, see [\cite=Pb] for details, see also work by Dubrovin [\cite=D]. In a recent paper, Guan and the author [\cite=GLu] obtained a mean curvature bound if (Mn,g) is isometrically embedded into warped product space and a class of ambient space. On the other hand, Heinz [\cite=H4] obtained a mean curvature estimate of a convex surface (M2,g) isometrically embedded into (N,) under conditions that g∈C3 and the existence of a global convex function in ambient space.

Another motivation to study Weyl's problem comes from general relativity. This can be seen by the definitions of quasi-local mass. The question concerns how to define the mass of a bounded domain (Ω,) in space time. Suppose Σ  =  ∂Ω is a topological sphere with positive Gauss curvature. In the time symmetric case, the Brown-York mass [\cite=BY] is defined to be:

[formula]

where H is the mean curvature of Σ in (Ω,) and H0 is the mean curvature of Σ embedded into [formula]. While in the case of space time, the Liu-Yau quasi-local mass [\cite=LY1] [\cite=LY2] is defined to be

[formula]

where |H| is the Lorentzian norm of the mean curvature vector. The positivity of mBY was established by Shi-Tam [\cite=ST2], the positivity of mLY was established by Liu-Yau [\cite=LY2]. By the above two definitions, we see that the solution of isometric embedding in [formula] plays a crucial role.

In the case that the Gauss curvature of Σ ceases to be positive, Wang-Yau [\cite=WY1] generalized the Liu-Yau quasi-local mass, using Pogorelov's solution to Weyl's problem in hyperbolic space [formula]. Their result was later furnished by Shi-Tam [\cite=ST] to obtain the following inequality,

[formula]

where H0 is the mean curvature of Σ embedded into [formula] and r is the distance function in [formula]. It turns out that this inequality plays an important role in our mean curvature estimate. In space time case, Wang-Yau [\cite=WY] further studied a new quasi-local mass using isometric embedding into Minkowski spacetime.

In general relativity, other than space form, a more interesting model is the Schwarzschild manifold. This can be seen from the Riemannian Penrose inequality [\cite=B] [\cite=HI], the equality holds if and only if the ambient space is Schwarzschild manifold. Moreover, if we can isometric embed [formula] into Schwarzschild manifold such that it's homologous to the horizon, then Miao [\cite=M] was able to define a local mass and prove a localized Riemannian Penrose inequality. Thus the solution of isometric embedding into Schwarzschild manifold is of significant importance to help understand not only the quasi-local mass, but also the localized Riemannian Penrose inequality.

In this paper, we consider a priori estimates of isometrically embedded surfaces [formula] in 3-dimensional Riemannian manifolds (N3,). Since the ambient space is no longer a homogeneous space, thus the C0 a priori estimate can not be automatically obtained by the metric as [formula] may drift to infinity. Therefore, one need to study carefully on the a priori estimate of the linearized equation. This was carried out in a recent work [\cite=GLW] by Li-Wang, they were able to obtain the uniform C0 estimate and openness under the condition that the mean curvature is uniformaly bounded, in particular the bound should be independent of the position of [formula] in (N,). However, the estimate obtained in [\cite=H4] and [\cite=GLu] does depend on the position of [formula], thus may not serve the purpose.

We adopt Heinz's interior C2 estimate to attack the problem. There're two major advantages of this method. The first is that our mean curvature estimate is indeed independent of the position of [formula] in (N,). The second is that we only require the metric g and [formula] up to third derivatives, where both g,∈C4 is required in [\cite=GLu].

A key observation in our proof is a bound of the total mean curvature. In Euclidean space, the total mean curvature can be bounded via the classic Minkowski formula, which was carried out by Heinz in [\cite=H3], see also [\cite=S2]. Using the same idea, we're able to employ the analogous Minkowski formula to bound the total mean curvature in the case of space form. However, for general Riemannian manifold, in lack of conformal Killing vector field, the Minkowski formula no longer exists. In order to bound the total mean curvature, we use the positivity of hyperbolic version of quasi-local mass, which is proved by Wang-Yau [\cite=WY1] and Shi-Tam [\cite=ST]. The total mean curvature is thus bounded due to the estimate of isometric embedding in hyperbolic space.

Before we state our theorem, let's fix some notation. Let [formula] be an isometrically embedded surface in an ambient space (N3,). Denote Ric and [formula] the Ricci curvature tensors of [formula] and (N,) respectively, and denote R = Tr(Ric) and  = Tr() the scalar curvatures of [formula] and (N,) respectively. Let ν be the unit outer normal, and h the correspinding second fundamental form, by Gauss equation, we have

[formula]

We now state our main results.

By Gauss equation ([\ref=G1]), assumption ([\ref=ellip]) implies σ2(h)  ≥  C0, which is the ellipticity condition in the view of partial differential equations. In particular, the mean curvature estimate corresponds to the case k = 0, we refer to Theorem [\ref=thm-curvature] in section 4 for detail.

Together with the recent work by Li-Wang [\cite=GLW] (the openness part of the isometric embedding problem), we can prove an isometric embedding in Riemannian manifold. In particular, we are able to prove an isometric embedding in warped product space without horizon or outside the horizon.

This Theorem is also presented and proved by Li-Wang in [\cite=GLW] and Guan-Lu in [\cite=GLu].

In view of Theorem [\ref=thm-1] and Theorem [\ref=thm-isometric], we require g∈C3 to establish C2 embedding. Recall that in the case of Euclidean space, Schulz was able to establish the embedding under the condition that g∈C2,α. A natural question is what's the optimal regularity condition to ensure C2 embedding. In general, a weaker regurarity condition to ensure corresponding regularity is the Dini continuity for elliptic partial differential equations. We say a function is Dini continuous if the moduli of continuity ω(r) satisfies

[formula]

It's easy to see that Hölder continuity implies Dini continuity.

In this direction, we are able to weaken the condition to g∈C2 with D2g Dini continuous in the case of space form.

By C2 surface, we mean that the embedding X is C2, with moduli of continuity of D2X under control. This is different from C1,1 embedding. We remark that this theorem is new even in Euclidean space.

The organization of the paper is as follows. In next section, we state some lemmas concerning the classic isothermal parameters, quasi-local mass and Heinz's interior C2 estimate. In section 3, we consider the isometric embedding in space form. In section 4, we consider the a priori estimates of the embedding and prove Theorem [\ref=thm-1]. We study the isometric embedding into Riemannian manifold in section 5. The proof of technical Lemma [\ref=Heinz-Lewy_Dini] will be given in the Appendix.

Preliminary

Let's list some basic formulas for isometrically immersed surface (M2,g) in an ambient Riemannian manifold (N3,). Denote Rijkl and abcd to be the Riemannian curvatures of M and N respectively. For a fixed local frame (e1,e2) on M, let ν be a normal vector field of M, and let h = (hij) be the second fundamental form of M with respect to ν. We have the Gauss equation and Codazzi equation,

[formula]

[formula]

We use the convention that Rijij denotes the sectional curvature.

Taking trace of ([\ref=Gauss]), we have

[formula]

where hij = gikhkj is the Weingarten tensor.

We first state a classic result about the existence of isothermal parameters of surface by Hartman-Wintner, see in [\cite=HW].

Let Σ be a surface and Br a domain in Σ. Let (lij) be a 2  ×  2, positive definite symmetric matrix in Br, such that lij is Dini continuous in Br. Then there exist isothermal parameters (u,v) such that

[formula]

in Br for r sufficiently small.

We also need the following lemma concerning the positivity of quasi-local mass, which was proved by Wang-Yau [\cite=WY1] and Shi-Tam [\cite=ST].

Let (Ω,) be a 3-dimentional Riemannian manifold with scalar curvature   ≥   - 6κ2 for some κ > 0. Assume that Σ is the boundary of (Ω,), which is a topological sphere with scalar curvature R >  - 2κ2 and positive mean curvature H. Then Σ can be isometrically embedded into [formula], let H0 be the corresponding mean curvature, then we have

[formula]

where r is the distance function from the origin in [formula].

In the case that (N3,) has horizons, we need extend Lemma [\ref=quasi] to the case that (Ω,) has more than one boundary components. This is proved in a recent work by Mantoulidis-Miao [\cite=MM] based on the work of Wang-Yau [\cite=WY1] and Shi-Tam [\cite=ST].

Let (Ω,) be a 3-dimentional Riemannian manifold with scalar curvature   ≥   - 6κ2 for some κ > 0. Assume that Σ is one conneted component of the boundary of (Ω,), which is a topological sphere with scalar curvature R >  - 2κ2 and positive mean curvature H. Assume further that all other connected components of the boundary of (Ω,) are minimal surfaces. Then Σ can be isometrically embedded into [formula], let H0 be the corresponding mean curvature, then we have

[formula]

where r is the distance function from the origin in [formula].

We attack the problem using Heinz's interior C2 estimate. The procedure involves two steps. The first step is to establish a suitable equation system and to transform the problem to the estimate of the elliptic system. The second to to obtain a lower bound of the Jacobian J(x,y) of the map. The following lemma is in fact the second step, see Theorem 8.3.2 in [\cite=S].

Consider the following elliptic systems of Heinz-Lewy type, let z = (x,y) = z(u,v) = z(w)∈W1,2(Ω) satisfying,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Assumption:

[formula], such that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

a is Dini continuous with moduli of continuity ω, such that

[formula]

[formula]

Let z(w) be a homeomorphism from the closed unit disc [formula] onto itself of class W1,2 solving the system ([\ref=Heinz-Lewy]). Suppose that assumption (1,2,3) is satisfied, assume that z(0) = 0 and

[formula]

Then [formula] and the Jacobian J(x,y) = xuyv - xvyu does not vanish in B. Moreover, for all BR, 0 < R < 1, we have

[formula]

where C,c depends on μ,λ,Λ,M1,M0,M and R.

In order to prove isometric embedding theorem in space form for Dini continuity case, we need to extend the above lemma to the case that a is only Dini continuous. This lemma will be proved in appendix.

Let z(w) be a homeomorphism from the closed unit disc [formula] onto itself of class W1,2 solving the system ([\ref=Heinz-Lewy]). Suppose that assumption (4,5) is satisfied, assume that z(0) = 0 and

[formula]

Then [formula] and the Jacobian J(x,y) = xuyv - xvyu does not vanish in B. Moreover, for all BR, 0 < R < 1, we have

[formula]

where C,c depends on λ,Λ,M,ω and R. In particular, the moduli of continuity of Dz is under control.

Isometric embedding into space form

In this section, we prove isometric embedding into space form using Heinz's type interior C2 estimate, under the condition that g∈C2 with D2g Dini continuous.

We first state a proposition.

Let [formula] be a C2 surface isometrically embedded into space form N3K, such that the second order derivative is Dini continuous. For any point (x0,y0)∈Σ, let Br0(x0,y0) be a geodesic disk in Σ, where r0 is a fixed small constant. Suppose that

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then there exists a homeomorphism (x,y) = (x(u,v),y(u,v)) from   =  {u2 + v2  ≤  1} onto r0 of class [formula] with x(0) = x0,y(0) = y0 such that

[formula]

Further more,

[formula]

where

[formula]

We first prove the existence of isothermal parameters (u,v) in Br0.

By ([\ref=G]), we have

[formula]

Thus we can consider

[formula]

as a positive metric in Br0.

Since Σ is a C2 surface with D2X Dini continuous, thus hij is Dini continuous. By Lemma [\ref=isothermal], we have

[formula]

in each Br  ⊂  Br0.

This is the local existence of isothermal parameters. We now want to apply uniformization theorem to prove the existence of (u,v) in BR. To do that, we only need to check the transformation map is holomorphic.

Let w1 = (u1,v1), w2 = (u2,v2) be two isothermal parameters. In the intersection area, we have

[formula]

By simple calculation, we have

[formula]

this is in fact the standard Cauchy-Riemann system

[formula]

or

[formula]

Thus we have a homeomorphism (x,y) = (x(u,v),y(u,v)) from   =  {u2 + v2  ≤  1} onto r0 with x(0) = x0,y(0) = y0.

By isothermal parameters ([\ref=metric-1]), we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

The equivalent conformal relations are

[formula]

We now derive the relation ([\ref=divergence_operator]). By ([\ref=inverse-1]), we deduce that

[formula]

By Codazzi equation ([\ref=Codazzi])

[formula]

thus

[formula]

Similarly, we have

[formula]

By ([\ref=conformal-1]), we have

[formula]

where [formula].

Together with ([\ref=divergence_operator]), Lemma 1.6.3 in [\cite=S] and recent theorem in [\cite=Li] by Y. Li(see Lemma [\ref=Li] below), we conclude that

[formula]

The propsition is now proved.

We are now in position to prove Theorem [\ref=thm-hyperbolic].

We first need to verify the condition

[formula]

Since space form are of warped product structure, we can write the metric [formula] as follows

[formula]

where φ(r) = r if K = 0, [formula] if K =  - κ2, [formula] if K = κ2 and [formula] is the standard metric on [formula]. Note that [formula] is different from the metric g on Σ.

Since warped product spaces equip with a conformal Killing vector field, we have the following formulas, see for example in [\cite=GLi].

[formula]

where [formula] and ν is the unit outer normal of Σ.

Take trace of ([\ref=conformal_killing]) with σij2, and integrate on Σ, we have

[formula]

By Gauss equation ([\ref=G]) and Codazzi equation [\ref=Codazzi] , we have

[formula]

For K = 0, we have [formula]. For K =  - κ2, we have [formula]. For K = κ2, by the Rauch comparison theorem, the diameter of Σ is strictly less then [formula], by a proper choice of origin, we have [formula].

To sum up, we have

[formula]

as the diameter of Σ is bounded by the [formula].

We can now apply Lemma [\ref=Heinz-Lewy_Dini], together with ([\ref=conformal-1]), we have

[formula]

for z = (x,y)∈Br0 / 2, where C depends only on C0, κ, [formula] and ω.

Moreover, we have for hij(z) = hij(w)

[formula]

for z1,z2∈Br0 / 2, where w1 = (u1,v2),w2 = (u2,v2), C and β depends only on C0, κ, [formula] and ω.

By Propsition [\ref=prop-1], x,y∈C0() and map boundary to boundary, this implies there exists 0 < ρ < 1, such that if (x,y)∈Br0 / 2, then u2 + v2  <  ρ2.

By Taylor expansion

[formula]

for z1,z2∈Br0 / 2. Together with ([\ref=C^2_alpha]), we have

[formula]

for z1,z2∈Br0 / 2.

In view of ([\ref=conformal_killing]), we have

[formula]

for (x,y)∈Br0 / 2, with moduli of continuity of D2Φ under control.

The full a priori estimate now follows by the fact that Σ can be covered by finite patches of Br0 / 2 with [formula].

For the case K  ≤  0, the theorem follows by Pogorelov's isometric embedding into hyperbolic space. For the case K > 0, we can first establish isometric embedding using the openness theorem by Li-Wang [\cite=GLW], i.e. Theorem [\ref=openness_theorem] in section 5 and the normalized Ricci flow. The theorem now follows from the a priori estimate established above.

A priori estimate of the embedding

In this section, we consider the a priori estimate of the embedding. We first state a proposition, which is essentially contained in [\cite=H4], too. For the sake of completeness, we give the proof here.

Let [formula] be a C3 surface isometrically embedded into a C3 ambient space (N3,), for any point (x0,y0)∈Σ, let Br0(x0,y0) be a geodesic disk in Σ, where r0 is a fixed small constant. Suppose that

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then there exists a homeomorphism (x,y) = (x(u,v),y(u,v)) from   =  {u2 + v2  ≤  1} onto r0 of class [formula] for any 0 < μ < 1 with x(0) = x0,y(0) = y0 such that

[formula]

Further more,

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the flat Laplacian of (u,v), and

[formula]

[formula]

By ([\ref=G]), we have

[formula]

Thus we can consider

[formula]

as a positive metric on Br0.

Similarly to Proposition [\ref=prop-1], there exists homeomorphism (x,y) = (x(u,v),y(u,v)) from   =  {u2 + v2  ≤  1} onto r0 of class [formula] for any 0 < μ < 1 with x(0) = x0,y(0) = y0 such that

[formula]

Note that instead of using the Theorem in [\cite=Li] by Y. Li, we may use Theorem 2.4.4 in [\cite=S] to obtain the C1,μloc estimate.

We only need to verify the relation ([\ref=laplace]).

By this isothermal parameters, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

By ([\ref=inverse]), we deduce that

[formula]

Similarly,

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

By Codazzi equation ([\ref=Codazzi])

[formula]

since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

thus

[formula]

we have used ([\ref=conformal-3]) in the second equality.

Plug ([\ref=eq-1]) and ([\ref=eq-2]) into ([\ref=x]), we have

[formula]

similarly

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

thus

[formula]

The propsition is now proved.

We now prove the bound for principal curvature and it's Hölder norm.

We first verify the condition

[formula]

Take κ large enough, then we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=quasi-2], we have

[formula]

On the other hand, by ([\ref=wyst_inequality]) in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-hyperbolic], we have

[formula]

where M only depends on κ and [formula].

Thus

[formula]

We can now apply Propsition [\ref=key_prop], by which we have

[formula]

Moreover, all the assumption of Lemma [\ref=Heinz-Lewy_theorem] is satisfied, thus Lemma [\ref=Heinz-Lewy_theorem] is applicable, so we have

[formula]

for (x,y)∈Br0 / 2.

In view of ([\ref=conformal-3]), we have

[formula]

for (x,y)∈Br0 / 2.

Similar to the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-hyperbolic], we have

[formula]

for (x,y)∈Br0 / 2.

The theorem now follows by the fact that Σ can be covered by finite patches of Br0 / 2 with [formula].

We are now in position to prove Theorem [\ref=thm-1].

To begin with, by Theorem [\ref=thm-curvature], in order to prove Theorem [\ref=thm-1], we only need to study the high regularity of the embedding.

Let's restrict ourself in local consideration. First choose O inside Σ and sufficiently close to Σ. Take r such that it is smaller or equal than the injective radius of Σ and N. Let Br  ⊂  N, a geodisic ball centered at O. Denote [formula].

Since the second fundamental form of Σ is positive definite, Sr is in fact convex and thus star-shaped w.r.t. O. Moreover, we have [formula], where ν is the outer unit normal.

Since r is smaller or equal than the injective radius of Σ and N, we can write the metric in Br as

[formula]

where σij is the standard metric on [formula], and φij is a function of r,θ.

Since Sr is star-shaped, we can write Sr as a graph on [formula], i.e. (θ,r). We have

[formula]

and

[formula]

we then have

[formula]

where

[formula]

Now

[formula]

since ∂r is the geodesic vector field, i.e. ∂r∂r = 0, we have

[formula]

since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

thus

[formula]

We first note that [formula], which can be deduced by the construction and the metric. By the above representation and Theorem [\ref=thm-curvature], we have

[formula]

for any 0 < μ < 1.

For high regularity, by Gauss equation, we have

[formula]

This is a Monge-Ampère type equation with right hand side positive. Since r∈C2,μ, we can apply Schauder estimate to obtain high regularity. Theorem [\ref=thm-1] is thus proved.

Isometric embedding into Riemannian manifold

In this section, we prove the isometric embedding into general Riemannian manifold. We use the continuity method to solve the problem. In view of the continuity method, our main result, Theorem [\ref=thm-1] serves as the closedness part, moreover, since the estimate is independent of the position, it also ensures the uniform ellipticity of the linearized equation. The openness part is done in a recent work by Li-Wang [\cite=GLW].

We now state two theorems by Li-Wang [\cite=GLW].

We now prove Theorem [\ref=thm-isometric].

To solve the problem, we indeed need to solve the following equation

[formula]

By continuity method, we need to solve

[formula]

for t∈[0,1]. The linearization equation is

[formula]

where τt is the variation vector field and D is the connection of (N,).

The homotopic path gt consists of three parts. For t = 0, we can choose X0 as a geodesic sphere of sufficient small radius, which is of sufficient large scalar curvature. We choose the normalized Ricci flow of g0 as the first part of homotopic path as in [\cite=WL]. At the end of this part, we have a metric [formula] of constant scalar curvature. The third part is the normalized Ricci flow of g, at the end of this part, we have a metric [formula] of constant scalar curvature. Now we embed both [formula] and [formula] into hyperbolic space. The last part of the homotopic path is to shrink [formula] to [formula] in hyperbolic space. Clearly, from our construction, the condition ([\ref=curvature_con_thm]) always holds.

Now consider the closedness part, by Theorem [\ref=thm-curvature], the mean curvature estimate is independent of the position [formula] in (N,), thus the equation system ([\ref=linearized_equation]) is uniformly elliptic, Theorem [\ref=linearized_theorem] is then applicable, which yields the bound of τ. The uniform C0 estimate follows by the formula

[formula]

C1 estimate follows from the metric, C2 and high regularity follows from Theorem [\ref=thm-1]. The openness part follows from Theorem [\ref=openness_theorem]. This fulfills the continuity method and thus the theorem is proved.

Appendix

To prove Lemma [\ref=Heinz-Lewy_Dini], we follow the steps in the proof of Theorem 8.3.2 in [\cite=S]. Since most of the procedures are the same, we only need to establish three lemmas that are different.

The first one is C1 estimate for divergence elliptic equations with Dini coefficients. This was recently proved by Y. Li in [\cite=Li]. The following lemma is only a special case in [\cite=Li].

Let u∈W1,2(B4) be a solution of the following elliptic equation,

[formula]

where B4 is the ball in [formula] of radius 4 at the origin. Assume that Aij is uniformly elliptic and Dini continuous in B4. Then u∈C1B1.

The second one is the replacement of Theorem 7.3.1 in [\cite=S], which was again proved by Schulz in [\cite=S1].

Let φ(z)∈C1(Ω) satisfy the elliptic equation

[formula]

such that λ  ≤  a(z,w)  ≤  Λ and a∈L∞(Ω). If φ = o(|z|n) as |z|  →  0 for all [formula], then φ(z) = 0.

The third lemma is the repalcement of Theorem 7.2.1 in [\cite=S].

Let φ(z)∈C1(Ω) satisfy the elliptic equation

[formula]

such that λ  ≤  a(z,w)  ≤  Λ and a is Dini continuous. If φ(z) = o(|z|n) for some [formula], then

[formula]

exists.

To begin with, we assume that φ is not identically 0, otherwise there's nothing to prove. Following the steps in [\cite=AM] and [\cite=S1], we consider another function satisfying

[formula]

Let η  =  φ + iφ, we have

[formula]

By Bers-Nirenberg's representation theorem [\cite=BN], we have

[formula]

where f is an analytic function, χ is a homeomorphism satisfying

[formula]

with χ,χ- 1 being Hölder continuous and χ(0) = 0.

Thus we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

for some 0 < α < 1.

Assume that

[formula]

where ak  ≠  0 and k  ≥  1. Note that k  ≠  0, for otherwise η would automatically be a local homeomorphism by the representation above, which is not true by the assumption.

Rewrite the above equation as

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula].

We now show that Aeiθ is Dini continuous. To show that, let z1  ≠  z2, if z1 = 0 or z2 = 0, then it's trivial. Suppose now z1,z2  ≠  0, such that |z1|  ≤  |z2|, we split into two cases.

Case 1, |z1 - z2|  ≤  |z1|β, for [formula]. We first show that

[formula]

for |z1 - z2| sufficiently small.

Now we have

[formula]

we have used the fact [formula] in the inequality.

Since

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

where ω is the moduli of continuity of a.

Case 2, |z1 - z2|  ≥  |z1|β. We have

[formula]

To sum up, we have

[formula]

Let ω0 be moduli of continuity of Aeiθ then

[formula]

since ω(r) satisfies Dini condition implies that [formula] also satisfies Dini condition, we have Aeiθ is Dini continuous.

Let χ = u + iv, then we have

[formula]

i.e.

[formula]

equivalently

[formula]

thus

[formula]

i.e.

[formula]

where

[formula]

Since Aeiθ is Dini continuous, thus Aij is Dini continuous. On the other hand, A(z) is sufficiently small as z tends to 0, thus Aij is uniformly elliptic. Since χ is quasiconformal mapping, W1,2 estimate of v follows by classical results (e.g. Lemma 12.1 in [\cite=GT]). We can now apply Lemma [\ref=Li] to obtain that v∈C1loc.

Similarly,

[formula]

i.e.

[formula]

where

[formula]

and again u∈C1loc.

Thus we conclude that χ∈C1loc.

Since χ is a homeomorphism and [formula], thus we have

[formula]

for C0  ≠  0. By the representation, the lemma is now proved.
