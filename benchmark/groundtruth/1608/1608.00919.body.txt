The PADME experiment

Introduction

Since first cosmological evidences, the the Dark Matter (DM) direct detection continues to remain an open issue. This puzzle can be solved hypothesizing that the DM does not directly interact with the Standard Model (SM) gauge fields, but only by means of "portals" that connect our world with this dark sector. The simplest model adds a U(1) symmetry and its corresponding vector boson A' [\cite=key-1]: SM particles are neutral under this symmetry, while the new field couple to SM with an effective charge εe and for this reason is often called Dark Photon (DP).

Recently has been noted that an A' with mass in the range 1   to 1   and constant [formula] can explain the discrepancy between theory and experiment on the muon anomalous magnetic moment [formula] [\cite=key-2].

The experiment

Approved by the INFN at the end of 2015, PADME will search for DP that decays into invisible channels (DM or long lived A' independently of the decay products nature) [\cite=key-3] [\cite=key-4]. The experiment is designed to detect as missing energy the A' produced in the reaction e+  e-  →  A'  γ, where e+, provided by the LNF linac, inping on a fixed target. Since the initial state kinematic is known ([formula] and [formula] for the e- and the e+, respectively), the A' invariant mass can be determined measuring the photon in the final state ([formula]):

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] has the nominal value of 550   along the z-axis.

Figure [\ref=fig:detector] shows the experiment layout. The detector consists in an active target (diamond with graphitic strips to determine the beam position), a MBP-S dipole, that deflects the exaust beam and direct the e+ that lost energy (the majority for bremsstrahlung) towards the vetoes, an electromagnetic calorimeter (616 [formula] BGO with energetic resolution [formula]), that measures the energy and the angle of produced γ, with a central opening to let bremsstrahlung radiation to pass, which is then identified by the small angle calorimeter (49 [formula] SF57 leaded glasses).

Main backgrounds to be reduced with the detector geometry are the e+  e- annihilation into 2 or 3 γ and the bremsstrahlung, while the pile-up, being connected to the bunch density, will be the most important limiting factor to the PADME sensitivity.

The collaboration aims to build the detector by the end of 2017 and to collect 1013 550   positrons on target by the end of 2018, reaching a sensitivity on the DP coupling constant to the SM charge ε of [formula] and a DP mass up to 23.7   (see Fig. [\ref=fig:sensitivity]).
