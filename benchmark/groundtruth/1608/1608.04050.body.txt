Semi-regular biorthogonal pairs and generalized Riesz bases

Hiroshi Inoue

Introduction

Let H be a Hilbert space with inner product (  ·  |  ·  ), [formula] an ONB in H and {φn} a sequence in H. In Ref. [\cite=hiroshi1], the author has defined an operator [formula] on [formula] by

[formula]

By using this operator [formula], the author has investigated the relationship between a regular biorthogonal pair ({φn},{ψn}) and the notions of Riesz bases and semi-Riesz bases. Here, ({φn},{ψn}) is a pair of Riesz bases if there exists an ONB [formula] in H such that both [formula] and [formula] are bounded, and ({φn},{ψn}) is a pair of semi-Riesz bases if there exists an ONB [formula] in H such that either [formula] or [formula] are bounded. In this paper we consider the following operators in H defined by a sequence {φn} in H and an ONB [formula] in H:

[formula]

where the tensor [formula] of elements x,  y of H is defined by

[formula]

This is also denoted by the Dirac notation |x >  < y|. Here we use the notation [formula].

In Section 2, we investigate the relationship between the operator [formula] and the operators [formula] and [formula]. The operator [formula] is always closed, however [formula] is not necessarily dense in H, equivalently, [formula] and [formula] are not necessarily closable. Indeed, it is shown that the following statements are equivalent:

(i) [formula] is closable.

(ii) [formula] is closable.

(iii) [formula] is dense in H. If this holds, then [formula] Furthermore we investigate the relationships between the notion of biorthogonal pairs and the operators [formula], [formula]. Indeed, if D(φ) is dense in H, then [formula] has an inverse and [formula]. However, [formula] is not dense in H in general. And so we may give the conditions under what [formula] is dense in H. In detail, the following statements are equivalent:

(i) [formula] is dense in H.

(ii) [formula] is closable and [formula] has a densely defined inverse.

(iii) [formula] has a densely defined inverse. If this holds, then [formula].

In Section 3, we first investigate the relationship between semi-regular biorthogonal pairs and generalized Riesz bases. In Definition 2.1 in Ref [\cite=h-t], the author has defined the notion of generalized Riesz bases under the assumption that Dφ and Dψ are dense in H, and has shown that if ({φn},{ψn}) is a regular biorthogonal pair, then both {φn} and {ψn} are generalized Riesz bases. In this section, we redefine the notion of generalized Riesz bases, that is, Dφ and Dψ are not necessarily dense in H and show that if ({φn},{ψn}) is a semi-regular biorthogonal pair, then both {φn} and {ψn} are generalized Riesz bases. This result improves the results of Ref. [\cite=h-t] [\cite=hiroshi1] [\cite=h-t2]. Furthermore, we have the following results:

(i) If ({φn},{ψn}) is a regular biorthogonal pair, then for any ONB [formula] in H. [formula] (resp. [formula]) is the minimum among constructing operators of the generalized Riesz basis {φn} (resp. {ψn}) and [formula] (resp. [formula]) is the maximum among constructing operator of {φn} (resp. {ψn}). Furthermore, any cloesd operator T (resp. K) satisfying [formula] (resp. [formula]) is a constructing operator for {φn} (resp. {ψn}).

(ii) If D(φ) and Dφ are dense in H, then [formula] (resp. [formula]) is the minimum (resp. the maximum) among constructing operators of {φn} (resp. {ψn}).

(iii) If D(ψ) and Dψ are dense in H, then [formula] (resp. [formula]) is the minimum (resp. the maximum) among constructing operators of {ψn} (resp. {φn}).

We study the physical operators defined by the operators [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] and an ONB [formula]. If D(φ) and Dφ are dense in H, then lowering, raising and number operators [formula], [formula] and [formula] for {φn} are defined, respectively, and raising, lowering and number operators [formula], [formula] and [formula] for {ψn} are defined, respectively. Furthermore, if D(ψ) and Dψ are dense in H, then lowering, raising and number operators [formula], [formula] and [formula] for {ψn} are defined, respectively, and raising, lowering and number operators [formula], [formula] and [formula] for {φn} are defined, respectively. These operators connect with [formula]-  quantum  mechanics, and its relatives. [\cite=mostafazadeh] [\cite=bagarello11] [\cite=bagarello2013] Many researchers have investigated such operators mathematically. [\cite=h-t] [\cite=h-t2] [\cite=hiroshi1] [\cite=b-i-t]

In Section 4, we shall show a method of constructing a semi-regular biorthogonal pair based on the following commutation rule under some assumptions. Here, the commutation rule is that a pair of operators a and b acting on a Hilbert space H satisfying

[formula]

The author has given assumptions to construct the regular biorthogonal pair in Ref. [\cite=h-t2]. Indeed, the assumptions in Ref. [\cite=h-t2] coincide with the definition of pseudo-bosons as originally given in Ref. [\cite=bagarello10]. We shall give some assumptions to construct the semi-regular biorthogonal pair that connect with the definition of pseudo-bosons, and show that by using the results in Section 3 and Ref. [\cite=h-t2], if D(φ) and Dφ are dense in H, then we may construct new pseudo-bosonic operators [formula] and if D(ψ) and Dψ are dense in H, then we may construct a new pseudo-bosonic operators [formula]. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between pseudo-bosonic operators [formula] satisfying some assumptions and the operators [formula] and [formula].

This article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define new operators [formula] and [formula] and study the property of these operators. Furthermore, we study the relationship between the operator [formula] and the operators [formula] and [formula]. In Section 3, we investigate the relationship between semi-regular biorthogonal pairs and generalized Riesz bases and give the physical operators defined by the operators [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] and an ONB [formula]. In Section 4, we introduce a method of constructing a semi-regular biorthogonal pair based on the pseudo-bosonic operators [formula] under some assumptions and we investigate the relationship between pseudo-bosonic operators satisfying some assumptions and the physical operators [formula] and [formula]. In Section 5, we describe future issue with respect to biorthogonal pairs ({φn},{ψn}) and generalized Riesz bases.

Some operators defined by biorthogonal sequences and ONB

Let H be a Hilbert space with inner product (  ·  |  ·  ). We consider the following operators in H defined by a sequence {φn} in a Hilbert space H and an ONB [formula] in H:

[formula]

In Ref. [\cite=hiroshi1], the author have defined an operator [formula] on [formula] by

[formula]

For the operators [formula], [formula] and [formula] we have the following

Lemma 2.1. The following statements hold.

(1) [formula] is a densely defined linear operator in H such that

[formula]

(2)

[formula]

Proof. The statements (1) and (2) are easily proved by the definitions of [formula], [formula] and [formula]. By Lemma 2.1, (2), [formula] is closed. However [formula] is not necessarily dense in H, equivalently, [formula] and [formula] are not necessarily closable. Thus we investigate the conditions under what [formula] is closable.

Lemma 2.2. The following statements are equivalent:

(i) [formula] is closable.

(ii) [formula] is closable.

(iii) D(φ) is dense in H. If this holds, then

[formula]

Proof. This follows from Lemma 2.1, (2). Next we study the relationships between the notion of biorthogonal pairs and the operators [formula], [formula]. Then we have the following statements.

Lemma 2.3. Suppose that ({φn},{ψn}) is a biorthogonal pair such that D(φ) is dense in H, then [formula] has an inverse and [formula].

Proof. By the definitions of [formula] and [formula], we have

[formula]

Hence we have

[formula]

Thus we have

[formula]

This completes the proof. In general, [formula] is not necessarily dense in H. We investigate the conditions under what [formula] is dense in H.

Lemma 2.4. Suppose that ({φn},{ψn}) is a biorthogonal pair such that D(φ) is dense in H. Then the following statements are equivalent:

(i) [formula] is dense in H.

(ii) [formula] is closable and [formula] has a densely defined inverse.

(iii) [formula] has a densely defined inverse. If this holds, then [formula].

Proof. (i)⇒  (ii) Since D(φ) is dense in H, by Lemma 2.2 and Lemma 2.3 we have [formula] is closable and [formula] has an inverse. Furthermore, since [formula] and Dφ is dense in H, [formula] is densely defined. (ii)⇒  (iii) By Ref. [\cite=hiroshi1], Lemma 2.2 and Lemma 2.3, we have

[formula]

Hence we have

[formula]

Thus we have [formula] is densely defined. (iii)⇒  (i) Take an arbitrary [formula]. Then,

[formula]

Hence, by Lemma 2.1, (2) we have

[formula]

By (iii), it follows that

[formula]

Thus, Dφ is dense in H. This completes the proof. Similarly we have the following statements.

Lemma 2.5. Suppose ({φn},{ψn}) is a biorthogonal pair such that D(ψ) is dense in H. Then the following statements are equivalent:

(i) [formula] is dense in H.

(ii) [formula] is closable and [formula] has a densely defined inverse.

(iii) [formula] has a densely defined inverse. If this holds, then [formula].

Proof. This is shown similarly to Lemma 2.4.

Semi-regular biorthogonal pairs and generalized Riesz bases

In Ref. [\cite=h-t], the author has defined the notion of generalized Riesz bases. First we redefine the notion of generalized Riesz bases.

Definition 3.1. If there exists a densely defined closed operator T in H with a densely defined inverse and there exists an ONB [formula] in H such that

[formula]

then a sequence {φn} in H is called a generalized Riesz basis with a constructing pair [formula]. Here, we delete the conditions of Definition 2.1, (ii) and (iii) in Ref. [\cite=h-t], that is, Dφ and Dψ are not necessarily dense in H. Then we have the following

Lemma 3.2. Let {φn} be a generalized Riesz basis. Then, we have the following statements.

(1) [formula] has a densely defined inverse and [formula].

(2) [formula], [formula]. Then, {φn} and {ψn} are biorthogonal and [formula] is a densely defined closed operator in H with densely defined inverse [formula]. Hence {ψn} is a generalized Riesz basis with a constructing pair [formula].

(3) [formula] is dense in H.

Proof. (1) and (2) are easily shown. (3) We first show that

[formula]

Indeed, this follows from

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since [formula] and R(T) are dense in H, it follows that D(φ) and D(ψ) are dense in H. Next we show that [formula] is dense in H. Take an arbitrary x∈D(T). Let [formula] be the spectral resolution of the absolute [formula] of T. Then we have [formula], [formula] and lim n  →    ∞TET(n)x = Tx. Hence [formula] is dense in R(T), and since R(T) is dense in H, it follows from (2.1) that [formula] is dense in H. This completes the proof.

In Ref. [\cite=hiroshi1], we have shown that if ({φn},{ψn}) is a regular biorthogonal pair, then both {φn} and {ψn} are generalized Riesz bases. In order to generalize this result, we define the notion of semi-regular biorthogonal pair as follows:

Definition 3.3. A pair ({φn},{ψn}) of biorthogonal sequences in H is said to be semi-regular if either D(φ) and Dφ are dense in H or D(ψ) and Dψ are dense in H. We give a concrete example[\cite=bagarello13] of semi-regular and non regular biorthogonal bases. Let {en} be an ONB in H and put φn = en + e0 and ψn = en, [formula]. Then it is easily shown that {φn} and {ψn} are biorthogonal bases such that Dφ and D(φ) are dense in H, but Dψ is not dense in H. We show that if ({φn},{ψn}) is a semi-regular biorthogonal pair, then both {φn} and {ψn} are generalized Riesz bases. In detail, we have the following

Theorem 3.4. Let {φn} and {ψn} be biorthogonal sequences in H, and let [formula] be an arbitrary ONB in H. Then the following statements hold:

(1) Suppose that ({φn},{ψn}) is a regular biorthogonal pair. Then {φn} (resp. {ψn}) is a generalized Riesz basis with constructing pairs [formula] and [formula] (resp. [formula] and [formula]), and [formula] (resp. [formula]) is the minimum among constructing operators of the generalized Riesz basis {φn} (resp. {ψn}), and [formula] (resp. [formula]) is the maximal among constructing operators of {φn} (resp. {ψn}). Furthermore, any closed operator T (resp. K) satisfying [formula] (resp. [formula]) is a constructing operator for {φn} (resp. {ψn}).

(2) Suppose that D(φ) and Dφ are dense in H. Then {φn} (resp. {ψn}) is a generalized Riesz basis with a constructing pair [formula] (resp. [formula]) and the constructing operator [formula] (resp. [formula]) is the minimum (resp. the maximum) among constructing operators of {φn} (resp. {ψn}).

(3) Suppose that D(ψ) and Dψ are dense in H. Then {ψn} (resp. {φn}) is a generalized Riesz basis with a constructing pair [formula] (resp. [formula]) and the constructing operator [formula] (resp. [formula]) is the minimum (resp. the maximum) among constructing operators of {ψn} (resp. {φn}).

Proof. Let [formula] be any ONB in H. (1) Since D(φ) is dense in H, it follows from Lemma 2.3 that [formula] has an inverse. Since Dφ is also dense in H, it follows from Lemma 2.4 that the inverse [formula] of [formula] is densely defined. Furthermore, since [formula], [formula], we have [formula]. Thus {φn} is a generalized Riesz basis with a constructing pair [formula], and {ψn} is a generalized Riesz basis with a constructing pair [formula]. Similarly, {ψn} is a generalized Riesz basis with a constructing pair [formula], and {φn} is a generalized Riesz basis with a constructing pair [formula]. Hence {φn} (resp. {ψn}) is a generalized Riesz basis with constructing pairs [formula] and [formula] (resp. [formula] and [formula]).

Take an arbitrary constructing operator T of the generalized Riesz basis {φn}. Since Ten  =  φn and [formula], [formula], we have [formula] and [formula], which implies that [formula]. Hence, we have [formula]. Thus, [formula] and [formula] are the minimum and the maximum among constructing operators of {φn}, respectively. Furthermore, suppose that T is a closed operator in H such that [formula]. Then, since [formula], [formula] and [formula], it follows that T is a constructing operator for {φn}. Similar results for {ψn} are obtained. The statements (2) and (3) are shown similarly to (1). This completes the proof.

Remark. Theorem 3.4 means the following:

(1) Suppose D(φ) and Dφ (resp. D(ψ) and Dψ) are dense in H. Even if Dψ (resp. Dφ) is not dense in H, {ψn} (resp. {φn}) becomes a generalized Riesz basis.

(2) Suppose that D(φ) and Dφ are dense in H, but Dψ is not dense in H. As shown in Theorem 3.4, [formula] is the minimum among constructing operators of {φn}, however the maximal constructing operator of {φn} does not necessarily exist because [formula] is not a constructing operator of {φn} different to the case of regular biorthogonal pair. Furthermore, [formula] is the maximum among constructing operators of {ψn}, however the minimal constructing operator of {ψn} does not necessarily exist because [formula] is not a constructing operator of {ψn}. Similar results for the case that D(ψ) and Dψ are dense in H, but Dφ is not dense in H are obtained. By Theorem 3.4, Ref. [\cite=h-t] and [\cite=h-t2], we can define the physical operators as follows:

(1) Suppose D(φ) and Dφ are dense in H. Then, we put

[formula]

[formula]

(2) Suppose D(ψ) and Dψ are dense in H. Then, we put

[formula]

Then we have the following

Theorem 3.5. The following statements hold.

(1) Suppose that D(φ) and Dφ are dense in H. Then we have

[formula]

Hence [formula], [formula] and [formula] are lowering, raising and number operators for {φn}, respectively, and [formula], [formula] and [formula] are raising, lowering and number operators for {ψn}, respectively.

(2) Suppose that D(ψ) and Dψ are dense in H. Then we have

[formula]

Hence [formula], [formula] and [formula] are lowering, raising and number operators for {ψn}, respectively, and [formula], [formula] and [formula] are raising, lowering and number operators for {φn}, respectively.

Remark.

(i) In case of (1), since

[formula]

the author has denoted [formula], [formula] and [formula] in Ref. [\cite=h-t2].

(ii) Suppose that D(φ) and Dφ are dense in H. Then the number operators [formula] and [formula] for {φn} and {ψn}, respectively have the relation: [formula]. This is called that [formula] is a [formula]-  operator [\cite=s-k2012] [\cite=s-g-h1992] [\cite=j-d1961] and positive self-adjoint operator [formula] is often called a metric operator for the [formula]-  operator [formula]. Suppose that D(ψ) and Dψ are dense in H. Then the number operator [formula] is a [formula]-  operator for the metric operator [formula]. The results on generalized Riesz bases is related to the problem of finding metric operators for quasi-Hermitian operators.

Semi-regular biorthogonal pairs and Psuedo-bosonic operators

In this section, we introduce a method of constructing a semi-regular biorthogonal pair based on the following commutation rule under some assumptions. Here, the commutation rule is that a pair of operators a and b acting on a Hilbert space H with inner product (  ·  |  ·  ) satisfies

[formula]

In particular, this collapses to the canonical commutation rule (CCR) if [formula]. In Ref. [\cite=h-t2] the author has shown assumptions to construct the regular biorthogonal pair. Indeed, the assumptions in Ref. [\cite=h-t2] coincide with the definition of pseudo-bosons as originally given in Ref. [\cite=bagarello10], where in the recent literature many researchers have investigated. [\cite=bagarello13] [\cite=bagarello10] [\cite=bagarello11] [\cite=mostafazadeh] [\cite=d-t]. In this section, we introduce that some assumptions to construct the semi-regular biorthogonal pair connect with the definition of pseudo-bosons. At first, we construct semi-regular biorthogonal pairs on the above commutation rule. We assume the following statements:

Assumption 1. There exists a non-zero element φ0 of H such that

(i) aφ0 = 0,

(ii) [formula],

(iii) bnφ0∈D(a), [formula]. Then, we may define a sequence {φn} in H by

[formula]

Furthermore, we have the following

Proposition 4.1. The following statements hold.

(1) bnφ0∈D(am) and

[formula]

(2) φn∈D(Nm) and Nmφn = nmφn, [formula]. In particular, Nφn = nφn, [formula].

(3)

[formula]

Proof. These proofs follow from Ref. [\cite=h-t2].

Assumption 2. There exists a non-zero element ψ0 of H such that

(i) [formula],

(ii) [formula],

(iii) [formula], [formula]. Then, we may define a sequence {ψn} in H by

[formula]

And we put an operator [formula]. Furthermore we have the following

Proposition 4.2. The following statements hold.

(1) [formula] and

[formula]

(2) [formula] and [formula], [formula]. In particular, [formula], [formula].

(3)

[formula]

Proof. These proofs follow from Ref. [\cite=h-t2]. The above Assumption 1 and Assumption 2 coincide with the assumptions of Ref. [\cite=h-t2]. We weaken the assumption of Ref. [\cite=h-t2] to the next assumption in order to construct semi-regular biorthogonal pairs.

Assumption 3.

Either D(φ) and Dφ are dense in H or D(ψ) and Dψ are dense in H. Then, if a pair of operators a and b acting on H satisfies Assumption 1-3, ({φn},{ψn}) becomes a semi-regular biorthogonal pair.

By Section 2, Section 3 and Ref. [\cite=hiroshi1], in case of D(φ) and Dφ are dense in H (resp. D(ψ) and Dψ are dense in H), [formula], [formula] and [formula] are lowering, raising and number operators for {φn}, respectively, and [formula], [formula] and [formula] are raising, lowering and number operators for {ψn}, respectively. (resp. [formula], [formula] and [formula] are lowering, raising and number operators for {ψn}, respectively, and [formula], [formula] and [formula] are raising, lowering and number operators for {φn}, respectively.). And we have

[formula]

Furthermore, we have the following statements with respect to the operators [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] (resp. [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula]). The proofs are easily shown.

Proposition 4.3. If D(φ) and Dφ are dense in H, then the following statements hold.

(1)

[formula]

(2)

[formula]

Proposition 4.4. If D(ψ) and Dψ are dense in H, then the following statements hold.

(1)

[formula]

(2)

[formula]

Next we investigate the relationship between pseudo-bosonic operators [formula] satisfying Assumption 1-3 and the operators [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] ([formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula]).

By Proposition 4.1, Proposition 4.2 and Theorem 3.5 we have the following

Lemma 4.5. The following statements hold.

(1) If D(φ) and Dφ are dense in H, then [formula],

[formula]

(2) If D(ψ) and Dψ are dense in H, then [formula],

[formula]

Proposition 4.6. The following statements hold.

(1) Suppose that D(φ) is dense in H and Dφ is a core for ā and [formula], then [formula] and [formula]. In particular, if [formula] is bounded, then [formula] and [formula], and if [formula] is bounded, then [formula] and [formula].

(2) Suppose that D(ψ) is dense in H and Dψ is a core for [formula] and [formula], then [formula] and [formula]. In particular, if [formula] is bounded, then [formula] and [formula], and if [formula] is bounded, then [formula] and [formula].

Proof. This is shown similarly to Proposition 2.5 in Ref. [\cite=h-t2] by using Lemma 4.5.

Discussions

As shown in Theorem 3.4, if ({φn},{ψn}) is a semi-regular biorthogonal pair, then {φn} and {ψn} are generalized Riesz bases, and so the physical operators (lowering, raising and number operators) are constructed. In case that ({φn},{ψn}) is not a semi-regular biorthogonal pair, that is, both Dφ and Dψ are not dense in H, it is meaningful to consider the following question:

Question. Under what conditions is a biorthogonal pair ({φn},{ψn}) a generalized Riesz basis? We have estimated that if a biorthogonal pair ({φn},{ψn}) is a D-quasi basis[\cite=bagarello13] [\cite=bagarello2013], then {φn} and {ψn} are generalized Riesz bases, where D is a dense subspace in H and ({φn},{ψn}) is a D-quasi basis if
