Proximity effects in cold atom artificial graphene

Introduction

The outstanding properties of graphene have boosted the interest in this two-dimensional, carbon-made material. Technology developments are linked mostly to its mechanical performances, large specific surface area and conductivity properties [\cite=roadmap-graphene] [\cite=castro_neto]. On the fundamental side, the most intriguing properties emerge from the peculiar material's band structure originating from the hexagonal geometry of the lattice, equivalent to two triangular Bravais lattices shifted relative to each other: each band is split into two separated ones. These bands touch each other at two distinct points within the first Brillouin zone, the so-called Dirac points. In the vicinity of the Dirac points, the dispersion is linear, and low-energy excitations behave like relativistic particles. Recently, there have been proposals to modify the band structure by bringing graphene on top of another graphene layer [\cite=bilayer-graphene], or close to other substrates [\cite=ortix2012]. Furthermore, the emergence of additional Dirac points has been observed in graphene on hexagonal boron nitride [\cite=yankowitz2012]. The proximity of graphene to a normal two-dimensional electron gas was studied in Refs. [\cite=principi12] [\cite=gamucci14] [\cite=aliaj16].

A different approach to studying properties of the graphene band structure is the use of artificial graphene [\cite=maciek-ag], that is, of systems that are designed to mimic graphene. Artificial graphene offers several control parameters allowing to tune the system. The variety of artificial graphene systems reaches from solid-state devices such as semiconductor structures with engineered nanopatterns [\cite=park2009] [\cite=pellegrini] [\cite=wang16], or molecules arranged on metal surfaces [\cite=gomesKK], to optical systems such as hexagonal photonic crystals [\cite=beenakker07] [\cite=RechtsmanPRL2013], microwave fields in metamaterial structures [\cite=KuhlPRB2010], or ultracold atoms in hexagonal optical lattices [\cite=soltan-hexa] [\cite=leticia-ag]. The latter system offers a great deal of control, and several pioneering experiments have proven the versatility of cold atoms as quantum simulators during the past decade, cf. Ref. [\cite=mlbook]. By engineering hexagonal optical lattices for bosons [\cite=soltan-hexa] [\cite=Jo2012] [\cite=DucaScience2015] [\cite=LiScience2016] [\cite=weinberg2016] and fermions [\cite=leticia-ag] [\cite=UehlingerEPJB2013] [\cite=uehlinger] [\cite=jotzu14] [\cite=FlaeschnerScience2016], cold atom systems with graphene-like band structure have been realized in recent years. These experimental possibilities have also stimulated theoretical interest in atoms on hexagonal lattices [\cite=duan-ag] [\cite=sols] [\cite=LeePRA2009] [\cite=poletti2011] [\cite=luehmann2014] [\cite=cao2015]. A particular feature of cold atoms in optical lattice is the tunability of the tunneling strengths. In the context of artificial graphene, this allows to smoothly introduce anisotropies, which can result into the merging of the Dirac points, and mass acquisition of the excitation [\cite=duan-ag] [\cite=sols] [\cite=LeePRA2009] [\cite=leticia-ag]. In a recent experiment, a gap at the Dirac points has been opened by introducing an energy offset between the two sublattices [\cite=weinberg2016].

In the present paper we propose a different way for manipulating the band structure of artificial graphene of cold atoms in optical lattices. Motivated by the so-called "proximity effect" where different materials are placed together in order to engineer topological superconductors [\cite=lutchyn2010] [\cite=sau2010] [\cite=hui2015] [\cite=cole2016], we consider a heterostructure of two layers with different dispersion. This scenario is closely related to the approaches recently used in real-graphene systems, where the proximity between graphene to other substrates is exploited both theoretically and experimentally. The proximity to hexagonal boron nitride has been studied in Refs. [\cite=ortix2012] [\cite=yankowitz2012]. A graphene layer close to a semiconducting quantum well was considered in Refs. [\cite=principi12] [\cite=gamucci14] [\cite=aliaj16], studying the interplay of a two-dimensional electron gas with a layer of Dirac fermions. Such scenario is relevant also in the context of a recent experiment which implements an artificial-graphene layer on top of a semiconductor via electron-beam lithography [\cite=wind15] [\cite=wang16]. A somewhat similar setup is considered in the present paper. We theoretically study a bilayer structure, where one layer has a graphene-like band structure, while the other layer has square lattice geometry. As illustrated in Fig. [\ref=scheme], the "graphene" layer is realized by a brick-wall lattice, which regarding its band structure is equivalent to a hexagonal lattice. With this, the square layer perfectly matches the graphene lattice with respect to the atom positions. It differs, however, with respect to the coupling between the atoms, as in the brick-wall layer every second link along the y-direction is missing. We then investigate the role of a coupling between the layers, for a non-interacting system in Sec. [\ref=sec:band], for a system with weak attractive interactions in Sec. [\ref=sec:super], and for a system with strong repulsive interactions in Sec. [\ref=sec:mott]. We describe a scheme for realizing such system with cold atoms in optical lattices in Sec. [\ref=sec:oli].

The bilayer system here proposed manifests a rich set of physical phenomena. Our main findings are summarized as follows:

(i) In the non-interacting system, the number and position of Dirac points are controlled by the interlayer coupling. While for weak coupling additional Dirac points arise from intersections between brick-wall and square lattice dispersion, for strong coupling all Dirac points disappear. If prepared at integer filling, the system then undergoes a transition from a semi-metal to a band insulator.

(ii) For attractive interactions, we find, within a mean-field approximation, re-entrant superfluid phases upon tuning the interlayer coupling. As for a single brick-wall layer, superfluid phases compete with a semi-metallic phase. The critical interaction strength is found to depend on the interlayer coupling.

(iii) In the strongly repulsive system, for which the low-energy physics is described by an appropriate spin model, we have used the quantum Monte Carlo method in order to investigate the competition between long-range order within each layer, and dimerization of nearest-neigbors between the two layers. We have quantitatively determined the critical interlayer coupling at which a valence bond crystal is formed ([formula]).

System

As illustrated in Fig. [\ref=scheme], we consider a bilayer structure consisting of one square lattice on top of a brick-wall lattice. The brick-wall lattice mimics graphene, as it represents a deformed hexagonal lattice. Accordingly, we can divide it into two triangular sub-lattices, a and b, and the annihilation operators on these sub-lattices are denoted by [formula] and [formula]. The operator which annihilates a particle in the square lattice is [formula]. The index [formula] denotes the position of the annihilated particle within the xy-plane. With these definitions, and assuming isotropic couplings Js and Jb in the square and the brick-wall lattice, respectively, the tight-binding Hamiltonian of the bilayer system reads

[formula]

where [formula] is the interlayer coupling. The sum over 〈〉 contains all nearest-neighbor pairs with [formula] in sublattice a and [formula] in sublattice b. The second sum, over [formula], shall include all lattice points in the corresponding sublattice, i.e. it is restricted to sublattice a for terms containing a operators, and restricted to sublattice b for terms containing b operators.

Loading the lattice with spin-polarized fermions, no double-occupancies can occur, and interactions are avoided. In this scenario, further investigated in the next section, we can explore the band structure of the bilayer. Interesting many-body effects, considered in the subsequent sections, will occur when the lattice is loaded with fermionic atoms having a (pseudo)spin-1/2 degree of freedom. In this case, we can have up to two atoms on each site, and local interactions become important. The Hamiltonian then reads [formula], where the σ index denotes the additional spin degree of freedom carried by each particle operator. The interaction Hamiltonian Hint is given by

[formula]

where we assume equal interaction strengths U in both layers. Again the sum over [formula] is assumed to cover all points in the corresponding sublattice.

Band structure of the lattice

Due to translational invariance in the xy-plane, the eigenstates of Htb are characterized by their wave vector [formula]. Given three sublattices a, b, and c, there are three eigenstates at each [formula], that is, three bands form the band structure of the lattice. As we elaborate in this section, the band structure undergoes a topological transition upon tuning the interlayer coupling strength [formula].

We start by considering the uncoupled system, [formula]. The band structure then consists of the two graphene bands [formula], and the band of the square lattice [formula]:

[formula]

with a the lattice spacing, set to 1 in the following. For simplicity, we choose Js = Jb = J. Cross sections of the three bands along ky = 0 and ky  =  π are plotted in Fig. [\ref=Fig2](a1, a2). The bands from the brick-wall lattice E- and E+, depicted in blue and red, respectively, touch each other in Dirac points at momenta [formula], seen in Fig. [\ref=Fig2](a1). Note that these are the only Dirac points within the first Brillouin zone of the brick-wall lattice, as the other pair of Dirac points at [formula], seen in Fig. [\ref=Fig2](a2), belongs to the second Brillouin zone of the brick-wall lattice. Therefore, in the uncoupled case, the points [formula] and [formula] are equivalent to each other, and in total we have a single pair of Dirac points. Of course, the bands also look gapless at conical intersections between the square lattice band (black dotted line in Fig. [\ref=Fig2](a1,a2)) and the brick-wall lattice bands. However, it is important to note that no gapless excitations live at these intersections. A gapless excitation would correspond to a particle hopping from the brick-wall to the square lattice or vice versa, which is impossible for [formula].

This is qualitatively different in the presence of a finite coupling between the layers: A gap opens at the conical intersections, except for four separated points in [formula]-space. These points now provide additional Dirac points, with gapless excitations, and linear dispersion along any direction in [formula]-space. Moreover, we have also calculated the Berry phase γ for each of the bands [formula] along a contour encircling the intersection point, [formula]. For the two intersecting bands, we obtain γ  =  π, while the third band has γ = 0. The position of the intersection points depends on the coupling [formula]. We parametrize them as [formula] and [formula], where ΔkIS is a [formula]-dependent wave vector shift shown in Fig. [\ref=kdata](a). For [formula], this shift is acos(3 / 4), which exactly produces the intersection points seen in Figs. [\ref=Fig2](a1, a2). For [formula], the shift has become zero, and both pairs of intersection points merge at kx  =  π and kx = 0, as seen in Figs. [\ref=Fig2](b1, b2). At this point, the dispersion around the intersection points become quadratic. For larger values of [formula], a gap opens, as illustrated in Fig. [\ref=Fig2](c1, c2).

The Dirac excitations directly originating from the brick-wall lattice turn out to be more robust against interlayer coupling. Their position in [formula]-space is shifted by the function ΔkD, also plotted in Fig. [\ref=kdata](a). A pair of points is found at [formula], coinciding with [formula] for [formula]. Another pair of points is found at [formula], coinciding with [formula] for [formula]. Notably, while in the limit [formula] all Dirac points are at zero energy, E = 0, and the two pairs are equivalent, this is not the case for finite interlayer coupling. The energy at [formula] is shifted to a positive value, while the energy at [formula] is shifted to the same absolute value at negative energy. Thus, the equivalence between the Dirac points at [formula] and [formula] is removed by the coupling, and they correpond to different filling fractions. As for the intersection points, the Berry phase around a Dirac point [formula] or [formula] is γ  =  π.

As described before for the intersection points, also the brick-wall layer Dirac points will disappear for strong interlayer coupling, but the critical coupling strength, denoted [formula], is significantly larger. At [formula], the shift ΔkD becomes zero, and each pair of Dirac points simultaneously merges to a single point at the center of the Brillouin zone, [formula], or at the corner, [formula]. We are able to determine [formula] analytically by solving for a band crossing at [formula]:

[formula]

For [formula], as depicted in [\ref=Fig2](d1) and (d2), the Dirac points have disappeared, and all three bands are gapped. The direct gap between the energy manifolds is plotted in Fig. [\ref=kdata](b), and is the same between the first and the second manifold, as between the second and the third manifold. Assuming one or two completely filled bands, the system thus undergoes a semi-metal to band insulator transition at [formula].

Experimentally, the existence and position of Dirac points can be probed by accelerating the atomic cloud via a magnetic field gradient. If the atoms pass a Dirac point, there is transfer between the bands, which becomes visible in the quasi-momentum distribution after a Bragg reflection. This method has been pioneered in Ref. [\cite=leticia-ag].

Superfluidity in bilayer system with attractive interactions

In the previous section, we considered the single particle (free) physics characterizing the coupled-layer system. This can be obtained by loading the lattice with spinless or fully spin-polarized fermionic atoms. In the following sections, we will consider the bilayer lattice loaded with two species of fermions, defining a pseudospin-1/2 degree of freedom (denoted by [formula] and [formula]). Then, the fermions may interact, as described by the Hamiltonian Hint. In the present section, we consider the case of weak attractive interactions ([formula]).

It is known that for uncoupled layers a pairing instability, captured by BCS theory, occurs in both the square and the brick-wall lattice, giving rise to a superfluid phase. However, while fermions in the square lattice form a superfluid at any attractive interaction [\cite=mlbook], a peculiarity happens in the brick-wall lattice. At half filling (n = 1), the Dirac points are located on the Fermi surface, and below a critical interaction strength u  <  ucrit, the system remains in a semi-metal phase [\cite=paramekanti06] [\cite=paramekanti12].

To make predictions for the coupled layers, we follow the procedure of standard BCS theory, that is, we treat the interacting Hamiltonian [formula] on a mean-field level. To connect our results to the uncoupled case, we separately study the gap parameter on the brick-wall lattice, [formula], and the gap parameter on the square lattice [formula]. In these expressions, the factors N / 2 and N / 4 stems from the number of sites per sublattice (with N the total number of sites). The BCS Hamiltonian then reads In this notation we have introduced [formula], and [formula], with J the intralayer hopping strength. Note that [formula], such that the matrix is Hermitian. The parameter μ is a shifted chemical potential, which shall absorb the corresponding mean-field terms [formula], [formula], or [formula]. We simplify our analysis by asking that μ takes identical values in both layers. With this restriction, we can only control the total particle number, but not the number of particles in each layer. We also disregard a possible spin dependence of μ, which renders the Hamiltonian symmetric under spin flips. We can therefore neglect the summation over σ.

The Hamiltonian HBCS is particle-hole symmetric, PHBCSP  =    -  HBCS, where P denotes particle-hole conjugation. Thus, the energy spectrum is symmetric around E = 0. The eigenstates at positive energy describe quasiparticle excitations, and the many-body ground state is the quasiparticle vacuum [formula]. We denote the quasiparticle operators by [formula], where the different types of excitations are captured by the index i running from 1 to 3. The corresponding energies are denoted [formula]. In this notation the Hamiltonian reads:

[formula]

Explicitly, the quasiparticle operators are given by

[formula]

and similarly for [formula], with the coefficients [formula] and [formula] obtained from diagonalization of [formula].

Once these coefficients are known, we can evaluate the number of particles and the pairing gap. By rewriting the original operators in terms of quasiparticle operators, it is straightforward to evaluate expectation values with respect to quasiparticle states. In the simplest case, at zero temperature, we just have to take the average 〈  ·  〉 with respect to the quasiparticle vacuum [formula]. We obtain:

[formula]

and the same expressions for [formula] and [formula] with the upper indices on the right-hand-side replaced accordingly. Similarly, we have

[formula]

and the corresponding expressions for b and c.

The equations ([\ref=aa]) and ([\ref=na]), and their analogs for b and c, can then be inserted into the gap equations. Restricting ourselves to zero temperature, we have

[formula]

and the number equation for the filling n per site

[formula]

Here, the summations [formula] shall cover the first Brillouin zone of the corresponding sublattice x.

We first consider a system at half filling (n = 1), for which the number equation is solved by setting μ = 0, independently of the gap parameters Δbr and Δsq. The gap equations are then solved iteratively. The results are illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:gap_n1]. Let us first comment on panel (c) which shows the behavior for two uncoupled layers, [formula]. As expected, the square lattice exhibits a finite gap, Δsq > 0, at any finite value of u. In contrast, the gap in the brick-wall layer remains zero up to a critical interaction strength ucrit  ≈  2.2 (in units of J used throughout the discussion). This behavior corresponds to the previously mentioned quantum phase transition from a semimetal to a superfluid phase. Panel (d) of Fig. [\ref=fig:gap_n1] shows the gaps as a function of u for a finite value of [formula], with both gaps being non-zero for any finite value of u. We conclude that no semimetal behavior exists in the coupled system at half-filling, n = 1

This interpretation can also be drawn from panels (a) and (b) of Fig. [\ref=fig:gap_n1], showing the gaps for fixed values of u as a function of [formula]. In (a), with u = 2, the brick-wall layer is in the semimetal phase in the limit of [formula], but a finite coupling immediately establishes a finite pairing gap in both layers. Up to a certain value of [formula], the brick-wall layer gap is further enhanced by the coupling, while the square layer gap always decreases with [formula]. For large [formula], both gaps become strongly suppressed, although at least Δbr remains finite in the full range considered (up to [formula]). The same behavior is seen also in panel (b) at u = 2.5, with only one qualitative difference seen in the uncoupled case, [formula]. At this interaction strength, also the uncoupled brick-wall layer is superfluid.

These findings indicate that at half-filling the most interesting physics is exhibited by a single brick-wall layer. This is actually not surprising as at half filling the Fermi energy touches the Dirac points of the uncoupled layer, while in the coupled layers scenario this requires filling 1/3 (n = 2 / 3) or 2/3 (n = 4 / 3), discussed below. Note that, due to particle-hole symmetry, the fillings n / 2 and (1 - n / 2) are equivalent. We also note that solving gap and number equations self-consistently is now considerably more difficult than at half-filling, as also the chemical potential depends on the gap. Our main results are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:gap_n36].

As expected, the system at n = 2 / 3 undergoes a semimetal-superfluid transition for any finite value of the coupling [formula]. This is seen in panels (e,f) of Fig. [\ref=fig:gap_n36], where the gaps are plotted for fixed u as a function of [formula]. Comparison of (e) and (f) shows that the criticial ucrit at which the system becomes superfluid increases with [formula]. We also note that, at filling n = 2 / 3, both layers are in the superfluid phase for [formula], i.e. no semimetal behavior is present in the uncoupled system.

The panels (a-d) of Fig. [\ref=fig:gap_n36] reveal an interesting re-entrant behavior of the superfluid phase. At sufficiently small u, as shown in (a) for u = 1.5, the superfluid gap vanishes when the coupling strength reaches a certain value [formula]. However, another gapped regime appears at larger couplings [formula]. For larger u, the intermediate regime of zero gaps shrinks down, to a single point near [formula] for U = 2, cf. panel (b). At u = 2.5, shown in panel (c), the two superfluid regions have merged to a single one, but a clear kink in the curve still allows to distinguish between the two regimes. At larger u, as seen in (d) for u = 4, this kink has faded away.

The brick-wall/square bilayer Heisenberg antiferromagnet

In this section, we will study the bilayer system with repulsive interactions, U > 0. At half filling, i.e. when the total number of particles Ntot is equal to the number of lattice sites N, the system is in a Mott insulating phase for sufficiently large U. In the perturbative limit, where [formula], the low energy physics of the system is described by an effective spin-1/2 effective isotropic antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Hamiltonian The indices [formula] now collect both the position of the spins in the xy plane, and with respect to the layer. The antiferromagnetic (superexchange) coupling [formula] arises from the virtual hopping of fermions in the sector of no doubly occupied states constituting the degenerate manifold of states describing the ideal Mott state corresponding to U =   ∞  . Explicitly, it reads

[formula]

We recall that at sufficiently low temperature, the isotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnet on hypercubic lattices is characterized by long-range antiferromagnetic order [\cite=review-heisenberg-square]. Despite the very low temperature scale set by the superexchange interactions, antiferromagnetic correlations have recently been observed in several experiments using Fermi gases in optical lattice [\cite=leticia2] [\cite=hulet14] [\cite=Greif2015] [\cite=Parsons2016] [\cite=Boll2016] [\cite=Cheuk2016] [\cite=Drewes2016]. Bipartite lattices in dimensions d = 2, such as square and brick-wall lattices, exhibit ground state Néel order [\cite=Sandvik0] [\cite=Castro]. Strictly 2-dimensional and quasi 2-dimensional layered Heisenberg antiferromagnets have been routinely studied motivated in part due to possible relevance to the physics of high-Tc superconductivity. The square-lattice bilayer Heisenberg antiferromagnet is interesting because it can be driven through an order-disorder quantum phase transition [\cite=Sandvik-Scalapino] [\cite=Ganesh] by increasing the inter-plane coupling realizing a lattice model instance of the continuum field theory physics described by the (2+1)-dimensional non-linear σ model. It was suggested that certain magnetic properties of cuprate superconductors are reminiscent of those of a magnetic state close to such a quantum critical point [\cite=HighTcAFM] [\cite=Chubukov] [\cite=Sokol]. On the other hand, such spin Hamiltonians are also relevant to the description of so-called spin dimer compounds which are magnetically disordered (pairs of spins bind together into singlets) but fascinatingly may be driven to order in a magnetic field via Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons [\cite=bec] [\cite=GiamarchiNaturePhys2008].

The inequivalent bilayer structure considered in this paper may be realized in an optical lattice setup as discussed in the next section, which warrants the study of the associated Heisenberg model [\eqref=HAFM]. For interplane coupling [formula], the system consists of two decoupled Néel ordered planes, although here each plane is characterized by a different value of the staggered magnetization. In the thermodynamic limit, the staggered magnetization per site in the square lattice is msq  ≈  0.3070 (see Ref. [\cite=Sandvik0]) while the lower coordination number in the brick-wall lattice leads to a moderate decrease to the value mhc  ≈  0.2677 (see Ref. [\cite=Castro]) due to enhanced effects of quantum fluctuations. Coupling the two lattices leads to an antiferromagnetically ordered two-layer system. In the opposite limit of [formula], neighbouring spins across the two layers are coupled to form isolated singlets or dimers. The excitation spectrum in the dimer phase is gapped, while it is gapless in the ordered phase. We restrict here to the evaluation of the critical coupling separating these two phases of the system. We mention that the two coupled square layers and two coupled brick-wall layers have been studied before yielding values [formula] (see Refs. [\cite=Sandvik-Scalapino] [\cite=Wang]) and [formula] (see Ref. [\cite=Ganesh]), respectively.

Since the system is bipartite, quantum Monte Carlo simulations can be performed without a sign problem. We use the projector Monte Carlo sampling method in the valence bond basis (we consider an even number of sites per layer) introduced by Sandvik [\cite=Sandvik-vbs] to obtain the ground state characteristics. We consider two coupled layers (a square and a brick-wall layer) containing L  ×  L sites with a square aspect ratio, so that the total number of sites is N = 2L2. In order to ensure convergence of observables to the ground state values, the projection length in the algorithm is chosen to be as high as 2L3. Performing the simulations in the valence-bond basis allows to access rotationally invariant correlation functions of the system (see e.g. Ref. [\cite=Lin]). In order to distinguish the Néel from dimer ordered phase, we consider the Néel structure factor (or square of staggered magnetization) of both the full lattice as well as for each layer separately. The staggered magnetization is defined as where the sum is over either all lattice sites or those pertaining only to a single layer and NS is the number of spins in the considered system (NS = N for the whole system and NS = N / 2 when considering a single layer. The staggering variable φi is a sublattice parameter - on dividing the total bipartite lattice in sublattices a and b, φi =  + 1 for sites on one sublattice φi =  - 1 for the other lattice. The structure factor is then defined as corresponding to ordering at the the wave vector  = (π,π).

In order to locate the quantum critical point, we perform finite-size scaling of S(π,π). Spin-wave theory predicts [\cite=Huse] the following finite size scaling of the magnetization for an ordered state: where L is the linear size of the system. Similarly, chiral perturbation theory and renormalization group calculations for the non-linear σ model yield the same form of finite size scaling [\cite=Sandvik0]. Hence this form can be used to estimate the thermodynamic limit value of the staggered magnetization.

The scaling form [\eqref=scaling] is well reflected in the obtained Monte Carlo data for the two-layer magnetization data as seen in Fig. [\ref=Fig3]. Deep in the Néel phase, e.g. for the inter- to intra-plane coupling ratio [formula] the dominant leading order finite size correction is clearly of the order of 1 / L for the system sizes considered. On increasing g the higher-order corrections become more important for lower system sizes. For g = 2.2, we find a polynomial of degree 3 in the inverse systems size 1 / L fits the data well. The value of the structure factor extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit L  →    ∞   is close to zero for g = 2.2. Hence we estimate the quantum critical point to be gc  ≈  2.2 for this model.

It is interesting to consider the in-plane magnetization of the two layers. We note that while for decoupled planes, the magnetizations of each layer is different, strong interlayer coupling is seen to make the magnetization uniform in both layers (see Fig. [\ref=Fig4]). For example, for g = 2.0, while the finite size values of the in-plane structure factor in the square lattice is always slightly higher than in the brick-wall layer, the extrapolated thermodynamic values are the same within the accuracy of the calculations (see Fig. [\ref=Fig4]) - top two lines). The in-plane structure factors also lead to conclusions in agreement with the estimate of the quantum critical point from the total system magnetization. As can be seen in Fig. [\ref=Fig4], the Néel-to-dimer phase transition at gc  ≈  2.2 is associated with the vanishing of the staggered magnetization in the two layers simultaneously.

Optical lattice implementation

Realizing these bilayers in solid-state systems, and tuning the coupling strength between the square and brick-wall layers is challenging. Fermi gases in optical lattices offer an interesting alternative where the system parameters can be freely adjusted. In the following we show that square/brick-wall bilayers can be generated using an extension of the optical lattice setups already used to realize brick-wall [\cite=leticia-ag] and double-well lattices [\cite=Sebby-Strabley2006] [\cite=Folling2007].

The key ingredient of the experimental implementation that we propose is a laser setup generating an optical lattice potential which alternates between square and brick-wall lattice structures when moving along the z direction. It can be obtained through the addition of two independent potentials, designed in the following by [formula] and [formula].

[formula] is created by the interference of the four retro-reflected beams sketched in Fig. [\ref=Fig8](a). Two retro-reflected beams propagate in the xz plane along [formula] and have in-plane polarization, whereas two other beams propagate in the yz plane along [formula] and have out-of-plane polarization. Their wavelength λ is chosen to be red-detuned with respect to the atomic transitions. Hence, the atoms are trapped in the intensity maxima of the light. When setting the time-phase between the four beams to zero, e.g. by using standard phase-stabilization schemes (as in Refs. [\cite=Hemerich1992] [\cite=Greiner2001] [\cite=leticia-ag]), the optical potential reads

[formula]

where VXZ and VYZ denote the single-beam lattice depths and k = 2π  /  λ is the laser wavevector. Superimposing a standard square lattice potential in the xy plane

[formula]

results in the desired succession of brick-wall and square planes for [formula] and [formula] respectively (where n is an integer index) when choosing adequate values of the single-beam lattice depths. For instance, Fig. [\ref=Fig8](b) displays the potential obtained for VY / VX = 0.9 and VXZ / VX = VYZ / VX = 0.02. Note that, in order to simplify the experimental implementation, [formula] can be realized using the same beam wavelength and geometry as [formula], but including only the running-wave beams. Then, a small frequency detuning δ between the beams leading to the different potentials is required in order to avoid unwanted cross-interference terms. Furthermore, the relative position of the [formula] and [formula] potentials in the xy plane needs to be adjusted (which can be achieved similarly to Ref. [\cite=Jo2012]).

Finally, to get the desired bilayer structure we add an independent bichromatic optical lattice along z with lattice depths VZ and [formula], and wavevectors kZ and [formula]

[formula]

It selects the xy planes in which the atoms are trapped and imprints a bilayer pattern along z, as shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig8](c). Tunneling between bilayers is suppressed by a strong potential barrier, whereas tunneling between two layers of each bilayer structure can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the ratio [formula]. The wave vectors kZ and k must be chosen such that the two potential minima of each bilayer coincide with a maximum and a minimum of [formula], a situation which is realized for [formula]. As shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig8](c), the total optical potential [formula] results in a square lattice in one minimum of each bilayer, and a brick-wall lattice in the other minimum with matching positions of the potential minima in both layers.

For fermionic 6Li atoms the lattice potential can be generated for instance with laser beams at λZ = 1550 nm, [formula] nm and λ = 730.7 nm, which have the correct wavelength relations and are all red-detuned with respect to the D1 and D2 transitions at 671 nm. A polarized gas can be used to probe the lattice band structure and the properties of the Dirac points using a combination of Bloch oscillations and interband transitions as in Ref. [\cite=leticia-ag]. Interactions can then be adjusted to both attractive and repulsive values using the broad Feshbach resonances available in the three lowest Zeeman sublevels [\cite=Zuern2013]. In the attractive case, evidence for superfluidity could be obtained by observing interference peaks in time-of-flight images after sudden release from the optical lattice [\cite=Chin2006]. However, attaining the required temperatures in the Hubbard regime remains challenging. The repulsive case is more favorable, and recent experiments have already demonstrated the emergence of short-range magnetic correlations in various dimensionalities (although long-range magnetic order has not yet been observed). The experiments use either site merging [\cite=leticia2] [\cite=Greif2015], Bragg scattering [\cite=hulet14], or high resolution in-situ imaging [\cite=Parsons2016] [\cite=Boll2016] [\cite=Cheuk2016] [\cite=Drewes2016] to directly measure the singlet fraction, the spin structure factor, and spin-spin correlation functions. They thus allow for a comprehensive characterization of the magnetic properties of each layer, as well as of the singlet correlations expected between them in the limit of very large interlayer coupling.

Summary

We have considered a bilayer system with combined brick-wall and square lattice geometry. In this setting which can be realized with cold atoms in optical lattices, the brick-wall layer represents artificial graphene with semimetal band structure, while the square layer exhibits a normal (metallic) band structure.

First, we have investigated how the coupling between the layers modifies the band structure. The Dirac points stemming from the brick-wall layer are shifted both energetically and in [formula]-space. In an increased Brillouin zone, the equivalence between different Dirac points is lifted. For strong coupling [formula], Dirac points pairwise merge, and a gap is opened. For larger [formula], the semi-metallic behavior (for integer filling) is replaced by band-insulating behavior. In the limit of weak coupling, additional Dirac points arise from the intersection of brick-wall and square lattice dispersion. A gap above these Dirac points is opened for [formula].

Second, we have studied superfluidity of the system in the case of attractive interactions, using a mean-field approach. Similar to a single brick-wall layer at half filling, we find a semi-metal to superfluid transition of the bilayer at filling 1/3 or 2/3. Upon increasing the interlayer coupling, the system undergoes transitions between re-entrant superfluid phases.

Third, we have studied the case of strong repulsive interactions, in which the half-filled system is in the Mott phase, and can be mapped onto a Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Using the quantum Monte Carlo method, we have studied the behavior upon tuning the interlayer coupling. For [formula], we find a phase transition from magnetic long-range order within the planes to a valence bond crystal with strong dimers between the layers.

Finally, we have presented a possible experimental implementation which is readily accessible in experiments with Fermi gases in optical lattices using state-of-the-art technology, and discussed perspectives for observing experimentally these phases.

Beyond its relevance for artificial graphene systems discussed here, our approach for generating an atomic bilayer system provides a general new tool for studying proximity effects with cold atoms. Future work may combine the bilayer scenario of this paper with ideas from a recent proposal where parafermions emerge in a heterostructure of a Bose-Einstein condensate and a fractional quantum Hall system [\cite=maghrebi15].
