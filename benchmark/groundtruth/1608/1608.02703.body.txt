The exact order of the number of lattice points visible from the origin

Introduction

The counting and probability problem of the visible lattice points is well known. Here a lattice point [formula] is said to be visible from the origin, if gcd (x1,...,xm) = 1. In other word, there are no other lattice point on the line segment from the origin O to X.

Let

[formula]

In [\cite=Ny72], J. E. Nymann showed that if [formula], the cardinality of the set [formula] is

[formula]

In this article, as a generalization of the result of Nymann, we study the number of elements of

[formula]

Let Vm(r) denote [formula]. Then we obtain a generating function of Vm(r) and the exact order of Vm(r), where [formula]. More precisely, we prove

If [formula],

[formula]

In short, the exact order of the magnitude of Vm(r) is rm - 1 for all [formula].

Generalization of Euler totient function φ(n)

In [\cite=Ap76], it is proved that

[formula]

We follow this way and introduce φm(n) to obtain the value of Vm(r).

Since [formula], we regard φm(n) as a generalization of φ(n).

The Euler totient function φ(n) satisfies

[formula]

where μ(d) is Möbius function. As well as this, φm(n) satisfies following lemma.

[formula].

It suffices to show that [formula], because the Möbius inversion formula gives the assertion. Let S denote [formula]. Let S(d) be [formula], where d divides n. Then S is the disjoint union [formula].

gcd (x1,...,xm,n) = d if and only if [formula], so [formula]. Hence we can write

[formula]

The equality on the left in Lemma follows.

Let us prove the other equality. If n = 1 the product is empty and assigned to be the value 1.

And if n  ≥  2, we can observe that

[formula]

Thus the other equality in Lemma also follows.

Generating function of Vm(r)

Generating function of Vm(r) is the following.

[formula]

It suffices to show that

[formula]

Let V+m(r) denote [formula] for [formula]. Considering the sign of component, we have

[formula]

Let A+m(n) = V+m(n) - V+m(n - 1), then

[formula]

We compute A+m(n) in a combinatorial way as follows.

Fix i with 0  ≤  i  ≤  m. Fix [formula] such that |I| = m - i, and let

[formula]

Then |V| = φi(n). There are [formula] ways to choose [formula] with |I| = m - i. So the number of points [formula] such that |{i ~ | ~ xi = n}|  ≥  m - i is

[formula]

But we count same point [formula] such that |{i ~ | ~ xi = n}| = k, [formula] times each i (m - k  ≤  i  ≤  m - 1).

We can show that [formula], so we can count all points in [formula] without repetition and obtain that [formula]

[formula]

Because the term i = m and m + 1 and j = 0 of above sum are a constant times X0, we get

[formula]

This proves the theorem.

The value of [formula]

Let {x} be the fractional part of x. If m  ≥  2,

[formula]

It suffices to show that [formula] for infinity many values of r and some negative M.

[formula]

So for m  ≥  4 the lemma follows.

Suppose that m = 2 or m = 3 and [formula], where the product is extended over all odd primes less than 100 and k isn't a multiple of 2 and p.

[formula]

Because we defined [formula], we obtain

[formula]

From this result and [formula], we find

[formula]

so for m = 2 or m = 3 the lemma follows. This completes the proof of the lemma.

If i  ≥  3,  [formula]

For i  ≥  3, Xi is defined by [formula].

[formula]

We note that

[formula]

,where γ is Euler's constant, defined by the equation

[formula]

Combining this result with Lemma [\ref=thm:4.1] and [formula], where i > 1, we get

[formula]

The exact order of magnitude of Vm(r)

If [formula],

[formula]

In short, the exact order of magnitude of Vm(r) is rm - 1, for all [formula].

[formula]

This prove that the exact order of magnitude of Vm(r) is rm - 1, for all [formula].
