Abstract

Asymptotically flat spacetime looks asymptotically like Minkowski space. One might therefore expect that the asymptotic symmetries are the symmetries of Minkowski space, the Poincaré group. Surprisingly, this is not the case at null infinity [formula]: it has been understood since the 1960s [\cite=BMS1] [\cite=BMS2] that the symmetries are described by the larger BMS group, which includes angle-dependent supertranslations. These symmetries have recently received renewed attention, thanks in part to their relationship to soft graviton theorems [\cite=Stroma] [\cite=Stromaa], the gravitational memory effect [\cite=Stromb], and perhaps the black hole information loss problem [\cite=HPS].

The goal of this paper is to show that the Goldstone-like excitations associated with these symmetries acquire a dynamics, induced from the boundary term in the action at [formula]. For simplicity, I focus initially on the case of (2+1)-dimensional spacetimes, where the BMS group also includes superrotations [\cite=AshB]. The resulting boundary action is a chiral Liouville theory, which is also closely related to the "Schwarzian action" that has recently been shown to occur in nearly anti-de Sitter gravity in two dimensions [\cite=Mal], and it has intriguing connections to the coadjoint orbit quantization of the Virasoro group [\cite=AlexShat] [\cite=Witten] [\cite=Balog] [\cite=SJ]. Chiral Liouville theory has previously been associated with BMS3 [\cite=BarnGomberoff] [\cite=BarnGonzalez], but in a somewhat less direct way, via a Chern-Simons formulation whose generalization to higher dimensions seems problematic.

The basic idea is fairly simple. If one starts with a theory with an action [formula] and places it on a manifold with boundary, one must usually add a boundary term [formula] to the action. Classically, [formula] is required for the existence of extrema: a variation of the bulk action gives boundary terms from integration by parts that must be cancelled off. Quantum mechanically, [formula] is required for the proper "sewing" of path integrals, the path integral analog of a sum over intermediate states. The key observation [\cite=Carlip1] is that even if the bulk action is gauge invariant, the boundary action may not be. Hence field configurations that would normally be considered physically equivalent can become distinct at the boundary, giving rise to new degrees of freedom. The action for these "would-be gauge degrees of freedom" is induced from [formula], and can sometimes be calculated explicitly. In particular, for (2+1)-dimensional asymptotically anti-de Sitter gravity, it is a Liouville theory [\cite=CS] [\cite=CS2] [\cite=Carlip2] with the proper central charge to match the Brown-Henneaux asymptotic symmetry [\cite=BrownHenn]. We shall see here that a similar conclusion holds for the asymptotically flat case.

To discuss the behavior of the metric near (future) null infinity, it is useful to choose coordinates in which the approach to [formula] is easy to describe. Bondi coordinates [\cite=BMS1] are defined by requiring that near infinity, spacetime is foliated by outgoing null cones, here labeled by a coordinate u (see figure 1). In 2+1 dimensions, the metric then takes the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

With the additional choice gauge V = 1, the radial coordinate r is an affine parameter for the geodesics generating the null cones. For convenience, I will make this choice here; it does not affect the final conclusions.

Barnich and Troessaert have analyzed the vacuum field equations for such a metric [\cite=BarnTrob]. With the additional restriction ω1 = 0, they find that

[formula]

near [formula]. The metric thus depends on the conformal factor ω and two functions Θ and Ξ of the angular coordinate φ, which can be shown to be the charges associated with supertranslations and superrotations.

We next evaluate the action of diffeomorphisms on this metric. Let us start with the standard flat metric

[formula]

and consider the diffeomorphisms

[formula]

where the coefficients are functions of new coordinates φ and u. For transformations that preserve the asymptotic form ([\ref=a1]) of the metric, the functions φ0 and u0--the asymptotic reparametrizations of the circle and φ-dependent translations of u--are the superrotations and supertranslations.

The requirement that the new metric be of the form ([\ref=a1]) with V = 1 and ω1 = 0 leads, after a straightforward calculation, to the conditions

[formula]

The components of the metric are then

[formula]

where the Schwarzian derivative {φ0;φ} in guu is defined by

[formula]

It is not hard to check that these results match ([\ref=a2]), but with coefficients that are now explicit functions of the parameters that label superrotations and supertranslations. In particular,

[formula]

(Ξ becomes a complicated function of the u-independent part of ∂φu0  /  ∂φφ0; we will not need its explicit form.)

To proceed further, we shall need the boundary term for the action. For a spacelike or timelike boundary with a fixed induced metric, the proper choice is the Gibbons-Hawking term [\cite=Gibbons], an integral of the extrinsic curvature of the boundary. For a lightlike boundary like [formula], the choice is less clear: the null normal to the boundary has no preferred normalization, so the analog of the extrinsic curvature, the expansion, is not unique. I will therefore take the less elegant approach of directly computing the boundary terms in the variation of the action and finding a boundary action to cancel them.

We start with the standard Einstein-Hilbert action

[formula]

on a manifold M with metric ([\ref=a1]) and a boundary at [formula]; we will take the limit [formula] at the end. A standard calculation gives

[formula]

As in [\cite=BarnTrob], let us set V = 1 and ω1 = 0 in ([\ref=a1]). A short calculation then gives

[formula]

The first term is a total derivative, and using ([\ref=a6]), the remaining terms simplify to

[formula]

where g(0)uu means the O(1) part of guu. By explicit calculation, the [formula] pieces cancel.

Now, ([\ref=b4]) is not, in general, a variation of any boundary action. This is to be expected: for a variational principle to make sense, we need to impose boundary conditions on some of the phase space variables. In fact, ([\ref=b4]) tells us, roughly, that guu and eω are canonically conjugate variables, a fact that can be confirmed by looking at radial evolution in the Hamiltonian formalism. To choose boundary conditions, note that the conformally compactified metric near [formula] is

[formula]

were ρ  =  1 / r. The only non-gauge-fixed component of the metric at [formula] is eω, so it makes sense to hold this quantity fixed. If δω0 = 0 at [formula], the boundary variation ([\ref=b4]) will be cancelled by the variation of a boundary action

[formula]

where ω0 is now an arbitrary but fixed function of u and φ. This is our induced boundary action for the superrotations and supertranslations.

At finite [formula], the action ([\ref=b6]) is not quite the Gibbons-Hawking term: that term is obtained by fixing the full boundary metric, while we are only fixing gφφ. But ([\ref=b6]) can be written in an invariant form similar to the Gibbons-Hawking term as follows. Let na be the unit normal to the surface [formula], and let [formula] be the null normal to the surfaces of constant u, normalized so that [formula]. The projector

[formula]

projects onto circles of constant u and r. It may then be checked that the boundary action takes the geometric form

[formula]

The action ([\ref=b6]) is that it is essentially identical to the "Schwarzian action" introduced by Maldacena et al. [\cite=Mal] in the rather different setting of two-dimensional asymptotically nearly anti-de Sitter spacetime. In particular, although the physical interpretations differ, the results of [\cite=Mal] on the quantum theory can be translated directly to this context. The boundary action is also intimately related to chiral Liouville theory. To see this, note that for ([\ref=a4]) to be a diffeomorphism, φ0 must be a monotonic function of φ, so we can write

[formula]

where γ and μ are constants and, from ([\ref=a5]), ∂uχ = 0. The dynamical part of the action ([\ref=b6])--the part that depends on φ0 and not only the fixed function ω0--then becomes

[formula]

Now consider the auxiliary two-dimensional metric

[formula]

with a scalar curvature

[formula]

If we choose

[formula]

the action ([\ref=c2]) becomes

[formula]

with the restriction ∂uχ = 0. But ([\ref=c6]) is precisely the Liouville action for χ [\cite=Seiberg], with a classical central charge

[formula]

A similar chiral Liouville action was found in [\cite=BarnGomberoff] [\cite=BarnGonzalez], by means of a Chern-Simons formulation, but here the meaning of the Liouville field is clear: it is precisely the parameter that characterizes superrotations. Note that the supertranslations are described by

[formula]

and therefore have a dynamics determined by the same action.

The action may also be expressed in the nonlocal Polyakov form [\cite=Polyakov]. If we define a new auxiliary metric

[formula]

it is easy to check that the boundary action ([\ref=b6]) is equal to

[formula]

with a central charge c given by ([\ref=c7]), up to a nondynamical term proportional to (∂uω0)2. Note that from ([\ref=a6]), we have

[formula]

explicitly displaying the dependence on the supertranslations and superrotations.

Our boundary action also has an intriguing relationship to the quantization of the coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro group [\cite=AlexShat] [\cite=Witten]. It is not quite the Alekseev-Shatashvili action of [\cite=AlexShat], which is not chiral, but it is the integral of the chiral stress-energy tensor of that theory,

[formula]

where the value of b0 corresponds to the orbit of L0 = 0 [\cite=Witten]. This connection is further strengthened if we examine the boundary action in which we fix guu rather than ω0 at [formula]. From ([\ref=b4]), the required boundary term is

[formula]

where ω0 is now free to vary while T, given by ([\ref=c9]), is fixed. Setting ψ  =  e-  ω0 / 2, we find that the equation of motion for ψ is Hill's equation,

[formula]

where a prime means a φ derivative. This equation has two solutions, say ψ1 and ψ2. If we set ε  =  ψ21, ψ1ψ2, or ψ22, it is then easy to check [\cite=Balog] [\cite=SJ] that

[formula]

But δεT is just the variation of T under an infinitesimal conformal transformation, that is, an action of the Virasoro group, and its vanishing determines the coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro group.

I have demonstrated that the supertranslations and superrotations in asymptotically flat (2+1)-dimensional gravity become genuine physical degrees of freedom at null infinity, with a dynamics described by a chiral conformal field theory. A good deal is known about this conformal field theory, though the "nonnormalizable sector" of Liouville theory is not fully understood. It should be possible to translate the field theoretical results into statements about quantum gravity, although one must presumably first understand the identification of the past and future theories as in [\cite=Stroma].

Somewhat mysteriously, the superrotation charge Ξ occurring in ([\ref=a2]) does not appear in our boundary action. This charge, which depends on the u-independent part of ∂φu0, occurs only at subleading order. Further investigation is needed to see whether we are losing part of the dynamics. In particular, it is not clear whether the chiral Liouville theory captures the full algebra of the BMS3 group.

It would also be useful to reexpress these results more invariantly in terms of the conformally compactified spacetime, using the methods of [\cite=AshB]. For instance, it should be possible to express the boundary term ([\ref=b8]) in terms of quantities on the compactified spacetime.

The main question, of course, is whether these results can be extended to a realistic (3+1)-dimensional spacetime. In contrast to the Chern-Simons approach of [\cite=BarnGonzalez], the basic approach of this paper should generalize to arbitrary dimensions, but the details may well be quite different.
