On the CR-curvature of Levi degenerate tube hypersurfaces

Introduction

This paper extends our earlier article [\cite=I2], and the reader will be extensively referred to [\cite=I2] in what follows. In particular, a detailed review of all the necessary CR-geometric concepts is contained in [\cite=I2], and we will utilize those concepts without further reference.

We consider connected C∞-smooth real hypersurfaces in the complex vector space [formula] with n  ≥  2. Specifically, we study tube hypersurfaces, or simply tubes, i.e, locally closed real submanifolds of the form

[formula]

where S is a hypersurface in [formula] called the base of M. Two tube hypersurfaces are called affinely equivalent if there exists an affine transformation of [formula] given by

[formula]

that maps one hypersurface onto the other (this occurs if and only if the bases of the tubes are affinely equivalent as submanifolds of [formula]).

There has been a substantial effort to relate the CR-geometric and affine-geometric aspects of the study of tubes (see [\cite=I2] for an extensive bibliography). Specifically, the following question has attracted much attention:

[formula]

Until recently, a reasonable answer to the above question has only existed for Levi nondegenerate tube hypersurfaces that are also CR-flat, i.e., have identically vanishing CR-curvature (see monograph [\cite=I1] for an up-to-date exposition of the existing theory). In an attempt to relax the Levi nondegeneracy requirement, in [\cite=I2] we set out to investigate question ( * ) for a class of Levi degenerate 2-nondegenerate hypersurfaces while still assuming CR-flatness. As part of our considerations, we analyzed CR-curvature for this class, and in the present paper we improve on that analysis.

Notice that CR-curvature is only defined in situations when the CR-structures in question are reducible to absolute parallelisms with values in some Lie algebra [formula]. Indeed, let [formula] be a class of CR-manifolds. Then the CR-structures in [formula] are said to reduce to [formula]-valued absolute parallelisms if to every [formula] one can assign a fiber bundle PM  →  M and an absolute parallelism ωM on PM such that for every p∈M the parallelism establishes an isomorphism between Tp(M) and [formula] and for any [formula] the following holds:

(i) every CR-isomorphism f:M1  →  M2 can be lifted to a diffeomorphism [formula] satisfying

[formula]

and

(ii) any diffeomorphism [formula] satisfying ([\ref=eq8]) is a bundle isomorphism that is a lift of a CR-isomorphism f:M1  →  M2.

In this situation one introduces the [formula]-valued CR-curvature form

[formula]

and the condition of the CR-flatness of M means that ΩM identically vanishes on the bundle PM.

Reducing CR-structures (as well as other geometric structures) to absolute parallelisms goes back to É. Cartan who showed that reduction takes place for all 3-dimensional Levi nondegenerate CR-hypersurfaces (see [\cite=C]). Since then there have been many developments incorporating the assumption of Levi nondegeneracy (see [\cite=I2] for references). On the other hand, reducing the CR-structures of Levi degenerate CR-manifolds has proved to be rather difficult, and the first result for a large class of Levi degenerate manifolds only appeared in 2013 in our paper [\cite=IZ]. Specifically, we considered the class [formula] of connected 5-dimensional CR-hypersurfaces that are 2-nondegenerate and uniformly Levi degenerate of rank 1 and showed that the CR-structures in this class reduce to [formula]-valued parallelisms (see [\cite=MS], [\cite=Poc] for alternative constructions and [\cite=Por] for a reduction in the 7-dimensional case). In particular, in [\cite=IZ] we prove that a manifold [formula] is CR-flat (with respect to our reduction) if and only if near its every point M is CR-equivalent to an open subset of the tube hypersurface over the future light cone in [formula]:

[formula]

Now, the main result of [\cite=I2] (see Theorem 1.1 therein) asserts that every CR-flat tube hypersurface in [formula] is affinely equivalent to an open subset of M0. This conclusion is a complete answer to question ( * ) in the situation at hand and is in stark contrast to the Levi nondegenerate case where the CR-geometric and affine-geometric classifications differ even in low dimensions.

In fact, in [\cite=I2] we obtain a stronger result. Namely, for the assertion of [\cite=I2] to hold, it suffices to require that only two coefficients (called Θ221 and Θ210) in the expansion of a single component of the CR-curvature form ΩM (called Θ2) be identically zero on PM (see [\cite=I2]). Our argument is local, and for every x∈M we only utilize the vanishing of Θ221 and Θ210 on a particular section γ of PM over a neighborhood of x:

[formula]

Each of the two conditions in system ([\ref=ceqs1]) can be expressed as a partial differential equation on the local defining function of the hypersurface M near x. These equations are quite complicated; for example, the first identity in ([\ref=ceqs1]) is equivalent to ([\ref=veryfinalthetav]). The expression for Θ210|γ is especially hard to find, and in our computation of Θ210|γ in [\cite=I2] some of its terms were only calculated under the simplifying assumption Θ221|γ = 0. This was sufficient for our purposes as we were only interested in solving system ([\ref=ceqs1]). Indeed, denoting by [formula] the quantity arising from the constrained calculation of Θ210|γ, we see that the system of equations

[formula]

is equivalent to ([\ref=ceqs1]). Interestingly, if in suitable coordinates the base of M is given locally as the graph of a function of two variables, the second equation in ([\ref=ceqs]) becomes the well-known Monge equation on this function with respect to one of the variables (see ([\ref=veryfinalthetasss])).

To write system ([\ref=ceqs]) more explicitly, recall that M is uniformly Levi degenerate of rank 1 and 2-nondegenerate. Due to Levi degeneracy, the graphing function of M satisfies the homogeneous Monge-Ampère equation (see ([\ref=mongeampere])). Thus, the detailed form of ([\ref=ceqs]) is

[formula]

where we additionally assume that certain quantities responsible for the Levi form to have rank precisely 1 and for 2-nondegeneracy are everywhere nonzero (see ([\ref=rho11]) and ([\ref=snonzero]), respectively). System ([\ref=threeeqs]) is the centerpiece of the proof of [\cite=I2]. In [\cite=I2] we explicitly solved ([\ref=threeeqs]) and observed that every solution of this system defines a tube hypersurface affinely equivalent to an open subset of M0. As M0 is CR-flat, this shows, in particular, that conditions ([\ref=ceqs]) imply the vanishing of the CR-curvature form ΩM on an open subset of the bundle PM over a neighborhood of x. Hence if both Θ221 and Θ210 are identically zero on PM, so is the entire form ΩM.

The main theorem of the present paper establishes a surprising dependence between the two local conditions in ([\ref=ceqs]). We will now state the theorem in general terms, with the detailed formulation postponed until the next section (see Theorem [\ref=maindetailed]).

Let M be a tube hypersurface in [formula] and assume that [formula]. Fix x∈M and a suitable section γ of PM over a neighborhood of x. Then the condition [formula] implies Θ221|γ = 0.

We stress that although the quantity [formula] was computed in part under the assumption Θ221|γ = 0, it is not at all clear a priori  why the vanishing of [formula] should imply that of Θ221|γ.

Together with results of [\cite=I2], Theorem [\ref=main] yields:

Let M be a tube hypersurface in [formula] and assume that [formula]. Fix x∈M and a suitable section γ of PM over a neighborhood of x. If [formula], then M near x is affinely equivalent to an open subset of M0; in particular, the CR-curvature form ΩM vanishes on an open subset of PM over a neighborhood of x.

The above result is rather unexpected as it has been believed for some time now that CR-flatness for manifolds in the class [formula] should be controlled by two conditions rather than one (cf. Remark [\ref=pocfunctions]).

By Theorem [\ref=main], system ([\ref=threeeqs]) reduces to a system of two equations:

[formula]

where we assume in addition that ([\ref=rho11]) and ([\ref=snonzero]) are satisfied. This system is truly remarkable. Indeed, by Corollary [\ref=flatness] it has a clear geometric meaning as it locally describes all CR-flat tubes in the class [formula]. Moreover, all solutions of this system can be explicitly found, and every solution yields a tube hypersurface affinely equivalent to an open subset of M0. Next, each of the two equations in ([\ref=twoeeqs]) has its own geometric interpretation: the classical single-variable Monge equation describes all planar conics (see, e.g., [\cite=Lan], [\cite=Las]), whereas the graphs of the solutions of the Monge-Ampère equation are exactly the surfaces in [formula] with degenerate second fundamental form. Finally--and quite curiously--both equations in ([\ref=twoeeqs]) happen to be named after Gaspard Monge. It is rather satisfying to see that the invariants constructed in [\cite=IZ] lead to an object so abundantly filled with geometric features. This indicates that the theory of the class [formula] is rich and deserves further exploration.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=secmain] we state and prove Theorem [\ref=maindetailed], which is the detailed variant of Theorem [\ref=main]. Further, in Section [\ref=secother] we investigate the converse implication, namely the question whether the vanishing of Θ221|γ implies that of [formula]. The answer to this question turns out to be negative, and in Propositions [\ref=main1], [\ref=firstcondrho] we write the general form of a solution of the system

[formula]

where, as before, we assume that ([\ref=rho11]) and ([\ref=snonzero]) are satisfied. Unlike ([\ref=twoeeqs]), system ([\ref=twoeeqs1]) describes a class of not necessarily CR-flat tubes in [formula], and Propositions [\ref=main1], [\ref=firstcondrho] show that this interesting class can be effectively characterized as well.

The main result

Let M be any tube hypersurface in [formula]. For x∈M, a tube neighborhood of x in M is an open subset U of M that contains x and has the form [formula], where U is an open subset of [formula]. It is easy to see that for every point x∈M there exists a tube neighborhood U of x in M and an affine transformation of [formula] as in ([\ref=affequiv]) that maps x to the origin and establishes affine equivalence between U and a tube hypersurface of the form

[formula]

where ρ(t1,t2) is a smooth function defined in a neighborhood of 0 in [formula] with

[formula]

(here and below subscripts 1 and 2 indicate partial derivatives with respect to t1 and t2). In what follows, Γρ will be analyzed locally near the origin, thus we will only be interested in the germ of ρ at 0 and the domain of ρ will be allowed to shrink if necessary.

Let now M be uniformly Levi degenerate of rank 1. Then the Hessian matrix of ρ has rank 1 at every point, hence ρ is a solution of the homogeneous Monge-Ampère equation

[formula]

where one can additionally assume

[formula]

In [\cite=I2] we showed that for ρ satisfying ([\ref=mongeampere]), ([\ref=rho11]), the hypersurface Γρ is 2-nondegenerate if and only if the function

[formula]

vanishes nowhere. Thus, assuming that M is 2-nondegenerate, we have

[formula]

Next, consider the fiber bundle [formula] arising from the reduction to absolute parallelisms achieved in [\cite=IZ] for CR-hypersurfaces in the class [formula], and let γ0 be the section of [formula] given in suitable coordinates by [\cite=I2]. In [\cite=I2] we computed the restriction of the curvature coefficient Θ221 to γ0. The condition Θ221|γ0 = 0 can be then written as the equation

[formula]

(cf. [\cite=I2]). Further, in [\cite=I2] we found the expression for the restriction of Θ210 to γ0 in which some of the terms were computed under the simplifying assumption that equation ([\ref=veryfinalthetav]) holds. If we denote the quantity resulting from this calculation by [formula], then one observes that the condition [formula] can be written as the equation

[formula]

where ρ(IV): = ∂  4ρ  /  ∂  t41, ρ(V): = ∂  5ρ  /  ∂  t51 (cf. [\cite=I2]). Notice that, remarkably, ([\ref=veryfinalthetasss]) is the Monge equation with respect to the first variable.

We are now ready to state and prove the detailed variant of Theorem [\ref=main]:

Let ρ be a smooth function satisfying ([\ref=initial])-([\ref=rho11]) and ([\ref=snonzero]), where S is defined in ([\ref=functions]). Then condition ([\ref=veryfinalthetasss]) implies condition ([\ref=veryfinalthetav]).

We emphasize that although the quantity [formula] was computed partly under the assumption Θ221|γ0 = 0, the fact that the vanishing of [formula] implies the vanishing of Θ221|γ0 is not at all obvious and is actually quite surprising.

We start by recalling classical facts concerning solutions of the homogeneous Monge-Ampère equation ([\ref=mongeampere]). For details the reader is referred to paper [\cite=U], which treats this equation in somewhat greater generality.

Let us make the following change of variables near the origin:

[formula]

and set

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=mongeampere]) immediately implies that p is independent of w, so we write p as a function of the variable v alone. Furthermore, we have

[formula]

Clearly, ([\ref=initial]), ([\ref=rho11]), ([\ref=changevar]), ([\ref=condsfg]), ([\ref=gprime]) yield

[formula]

In terms of p and q, the inverse of ([\ref=changevar]) is written as

[formula]

and the solution ρ in the variables v,w is given by

[formula]

In particular, we see that the general smooth solution of the homogeneous Monge-Ampère equation ([\ref=mongeampere]) satisfying conditions ([\ref=initial]), ([\ref=rho11]) is parametrized by a pair of arbitrary smooth functions satisfying ([\ref=initialconds]).

We will now rewrite equation ([\ref=veryfinalthetav]) in the variables v, w introduced in ([\ref=changevar]). First of all, from ([\ref=changevar]), ([\ref=inverttted]) we compute

[formula]

Next, from formulas ([\ref=functions]), ([\ref=inverttted]) and the first two identities in ([\ref=secondpartials]) we obtain

[formula]

Now, plugging the expressions from ([\ref=secondpartials]), ([\ref=ids444]) into ([\ref=veryfinalthetav]), we see that the latter simplifies to the equation

[formula]

that is, to the condition S1 = 0. Since S vanishes nowhere, the first identity in ([\ref=ids444]) implies that p'' does not vanish either (this condition characterizes 2-nondegeneracy). Then, dividing ([\ref=vanish1]) by (p'')2, one obtains

[formula]

Thus, we see that after passing to the variables v, w the complicated equation ([\ref=veryfinalthetav]) turns into the simple condition ([\ref=firstcur]).

Further, we will rewrite equation ([\ref=veryfinalthetasss]) in the variables v, w. From ([\ref=inverttted]) and ([\ref=secondpartials]) one computes

[formula]

Plugging expressions from ([\ref=secondpartials]), ([\ref=rho4and5]) into ([\ref=veryfinalthetasss]) and collecting coefficients at wk for k = 0,1,2,3 in the resulting formula, we see that ([\ref=veryfinalthetasss]) is equivalent to the following system of four ordinary differential equations:

[formula]

Thus, in order to prove the theorem, we need to show that system ([\ref=final1]) implies condition ([\ref=firstcur]).

Notice that the first equation in ([\ref=final1]) is the Monge equation and that the last one yields the Monge equation for any primitive of the function q. Also observe that all the equations in ([\ref=final1]) reduce to the first one if condition ([\ref=firstcur]) is satisfied.

Recall now that the Monge equation describes planar conics and can be solved explicitly. Indeed, assuming that p'' > 0 we calculate

[formula]

Similarly, for p'' < 0 we have

[formula]

Thus, the first equation in ([\ref=final1]) yields

[formula]

where P is a polynomial with deg P  ≤  2 and P(0) > 0. Similarly, taking into account ([\ref=initialconds]), from the last equation in ([\ref=final1]) we see

[formula]

where Q is a polynomial with deg Q  ≤  2 and Q(0) > 0.

Next, from ([\ref=pprpr]), ([\ref=qpr]) we calculate

[formula]

Plugging ([\ref=pprpr]), ([\ref=qpr]), ([\ref=derivs]) into the second and third equations in ([\ref=final1]) and simplifying the resulting expressions, we obtain, respectively,

[formula]

Subtracting the second identity in ([\ref=PQ]) from the first one, we arrive at

[formula]

It then follows that [formula], and therefore condition ([\ref=firstcur]) holds as required. The proof is complete.

A class of nonflat tubes

In this section we investigate the question of whether for a hypersurface of the form ([\ref=basiceq]) that is uniformly Levi degenerate of rank 1 and 2-nondegenerate the condition Θ221|γ0 = 0 yields CR-flatness. Equivalently,

[formula]

If one looks at ([\ref=veryfinalthetav]) and ([\ref=veryfinalthetasss]) in their original complicated PDE form, this question may appear to be hard. Luckily, after passing to the variables v, w as in ([\ref=changevar]), both equations simplify: ([\ref=veryfinalthetav]) becomes condition ([\ref=firstcur]), whereas ([\ref=veryfinalthetasss]) turns into the system of four ordinary differential equations ([\ref=final1]). In fact, as we remarked in the proof of Theorem [\ref=maindetailed] in the preceding section, ([\ref=firstcur]) forces all the equations in ([\ref=final1]) to be identical to the Monge equation on the function p, thus, assuming that ([\ref=firstcur]) holds, ([\ref=veryfinalthetasss]) actually reduces to a single ODE. Therefore, for any p that is not  a solution of the Monge equation and such that

[formula]

and for

[formula]

formula ([\ref=solsparam]) provides a counterexample to question ( *  * ) (see, e.g., Example [\ref=ex] below).

In fact, for p having properties ([\ref=condss1]) and q chosen as in ([\ref=condss2]), formula ([\ref=solsparam]) significantly simplifies:

Let ρ be a smooth function satisfying ([\ref=initial])-([\ref=rho11]), ([\ref=snonzero]) and ([\ref=veryfinalthetav]). Then formula ([\ref=solsparam]) becomes

[formula]

Substituting ([\ref=condss2]) into ([\ref=solsparam]) we calculate

[formula]

as required.

Thus, all hypersurfaces of the form ([\ref=basiceq]) that are 2-nondegenerate, uniformly Levi degenerate of rank 1, and for which Θ221|γ0 = 0, are described by formula ([\ref=solsparam1]). This is an interesting class of not necessarily CR-flat tubes, and it is quite useful to have an explicit characterization for it. Notice, however, that although formula ([\ref=solsparam1]) is very simple, it is written in the variables v, w, whereas the expression for ρ in the original variables t1, t2 (which is what we are really interested in) may turn out to be more complicated. This expression was found in [\cite=I2], and, as the argument is quite short, we repeat it here for the sake of the completeness of our exposition.

Let ζ be the inverse of the function p'(0) - p' near the origin. Define

[formula]

Clearly, χ is smooth near 0 and satisfies

[formula]

Now set

[formula]

One has ρ  =  .

From ([\ref=deftilderho]) we compute:

[formula]

Formulas ([\ref=chiconds]), ([\ref=deftilderho]), ([\ref=tilderhoderiv]) imply

[formula]

Also, it is easy to observe that [formula] satisfies the Monge-Ampère equation ([\ref=mongeampere]). Hence, [formula] is fully determined by a pair of functions p̃, [formula] as in formulas ([\ref=inverttted]), ([\ref=solsparam]). These functions satisfy

[formula]

(cf. conditions ([\ref=initialconds])).

Let us make a change of coordinates near the origin analogous to ([\ref=changevar]):

[formula]

Then by the first identity in ([\ref=tilderhoderiv]) we have

[formula]

and therefore, taking into account ([\ref=condss2]), we see that ([\ref=changevar1]) is inverted as

[formula]

On the other hand, as in ([\ref=inverttted]) we have

[formula]

Hence, it follows that  = q and, since p̃(0) = p(0) = 0, one also has p̃ = p. Therefore,   =  ρ, and the proof is complete.

We will now demonstrate how Propositions [\ref=main1], [\ref=firstcondrho] work for a particular example.

Let p(v) = ev - 1. Clearly, conditions ([\ref=condss1]) hold for this choice of p. Then by formula ([\ref=solsparam1]) we compute

[formula]

where C > 0. To rewrite ρ in the variables t1, t2, we can either directly invert formula ([\ref=inverttted]) or use Proposition [\ref=firstcondrho]. To invert formula ([\ref=inverttted]), we notice that for our choice of p and q it becomes

[formula]

We then obtain

[formula]

and plugging ([\ref=inverse]) into ([\ref=formrho]) yields

[formula]

Rather than inverting formula ([\ref=inverttted]), let us now utilize Proposition [\ref=firstcondrho] in order to determine ρ(t1,t2). We have ζ(σ) =  log (1 - σ), and therefore by ([\ref=functchi]) we see

[formula]

Then after a short calculation formula ([\ref=deftilderho]) leads to expression ([\ref=formmmrho]) as well.

Note that, since the function p(v) in this example does not satisfy the Monge equation, the corresponding tube hypersurface Γρ defined by ([\ref=basiceq]) is not CR-flat, or, equivalently, the quantity [formula] does not identically vanish.

For any real hypersurface M in [formula] in the class [formula], paper [\cite=Poc] introduces a pair of expressions, called J and W, in terms of a local defining function that vanish simultaneously on M if and only if M is locally CR-equivalent to M0. The expressions are rather complicated, but in the tube case it is not very hard to see that the condition W = 0 is identical to equation ([\ref=veryfinalthetav]) (i.e., to the vanishing of Θ221|γ0) and the condition J = 0 calculated under the assumption W = 0 to equation ([\ref=veryfinalthetasss]) (i.e., to the vanishing of Θ210|γ0 calculated in part under the assumption Θ221|γ0 = 0 as in [\cite=I2]). It would be interesting to see whether an analogue of Theorem [\ref=main] holds for J and W in place of Θ210|γ0, Θ221|γ0, respectively, if the hypersurface is no longer assumed to be tube, i.e., whether it is possible to find a reasonable single condition characterizing CR-flatness for the entire class [formula].
