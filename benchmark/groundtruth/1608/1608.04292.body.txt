Spectral investigation of the noise influencing multi-qubit states

Introduction

The inevitable presence of local electromagnetic noise may cause loss of quantum coherences of spin systems or induce redistribution of spin populations. This phenomenon which is often described in terms of decoherence or depolarization appears in NMR as a net relaxation of transverse or longitudinal magnetization. Combating decoherence is of utmost importance in spectroscopy and in realizing quantum devices such as quantum information processors (QIP). Passive techniques like decoherence-free subspaces (DFS)[\cite=lidar1998decoherence] [\cite=Lidar2003] as well as active techniques like dynamical decoupling (DD)[\cite=viola1999dynamical] and quantum error correcting codes [\cite=cory1998experimental] [\cite=Preskill385] have been developed to overcome decoherence. While the passive techniques rely on exploiting the symmetries in the interaction Hamiltonian, the active techniques focus on systematic modulation of the quantum states to suppress decoherence. In the following we discuss about the quantum noise in various types of quantum coherences including DFS, single-quantum, as well as multiple-quantum coherences.

An example of DFS is the singlet subspace in a two-qubit system [\cite=Lidar2003]. In NMR, an excess population in the singlet state, over the uniformly distributed triplet states, is termed as a singlet order. It has been shown that, such an order, under favorable circumstances, has much longer life-times than the usual longitudinal relaxation time scales, and is therefore known as a long-lived singlet state (LLS) [\cite=carravetta2004long]. Similarly, the coherence between the singlet state and the zero-quantum triplet state also has longer life-times than the usual transverse relaxation time scales, and is therefore termed as a long-lived coherence (LLC) [\cite=sarkarnmrs]. On the other hand, several other single- and multiple-quantum coherences lack the symmetry properties and are therefore prone to decoherence [\cite=jones2009magnetic].

In this work we attempt to extract the noise spectra acting on various quantum coherences of NMR spin-systems. Learning about noise-spectrum not only provides insights into the physical process of quantum noise, but also assists in optimizing DFS conditions as well as in designing better controls for active suppression of noise. Quantum noise spectroscopy (QNS), a tool to characterize the environmental noise, was independently proposed by Yuge et al [\cite=yuge2011measurement] and Àlvarez and Suter[\cite=alvarez2011measuring].

The paper is organized as follows. In the following section we describe the theoretical formalism of QNS. In section III, we apply QNS and experimentally extract the noise spectra of some interesting quantum coherences. Finally we conclude in section IV.

Theory and Methods

Here we review the theoretical aspects of characterizing the quantum noise using a single two-level quantum system (qubit) as a probe. We consider the qubit to be coupled to a bath via a purely dephasing interaction. Assuming the system Hamiltonian HS  =  ω0σz / 2 and the bath Hamiltonian HB, the joint-evolution is described by the Hamiltonian

[formula]

Here HSB  =  jSBσzB / 2 describes the system-bath interaction with B being the bath operator and jSB being the system-bath coupling strength. In the interaction picture of the bath Hamiltonian, the bath operator

[formula]

becomes time-dependent. After tracing-out the bath variables, the interaction Hamiltonian reduces to

[formula]

where b'(t) is a stochastic function. We treat the bath to be classical and b'(t) to be zero-mean stationary Gaussian process, as has been assumed before [\cite=yuge2011measurement] [\cite=alvarez2011measuring]. However, an extension to a non-Gaussian case has also been reported recently [\cite=PhysRevLett.116.150503].

Suppose a DD sequence involving a series of π pules is applied to refocus the dephasing caused by H'S(B). In the interaction representation associated with the DD sequence, the Hamiltonian H'S(B) transforms to

[formula]

where f(t) is the modulation function that switches between + 1 and - 1 with the application of every π-pulse (see Figure [\ref=ff]). The Fourier transform of f(t) is known as the Filter function F(ω,τf), where τf is the period of f(t).

Noise spectral density S(ω) is defined as the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function g(τ)  =  〈b'(τ)b'(t + τ)〉. The decay of quantum coherence is influenced by the noise spectral density as well as the filter function [\cite=Abragam] [\cite=Biercuk]. This decay can be modeled in the form exp ( - tR(t)), wherein the time-dependent argument for n iterations of a DD sequence is given by,

[formula]

[\cite=PhysRevLett.87.270405] [\cite=PhysRevLett.93.130406] [\cite=PhysRevB.77.174509].

Fourier analysis of DD induced modulations is similar to that of a diffraction grating. For time-scales much larger than the noise correlation times, i.e., for large n, the filter-function becomes time independent and reduces to a delta-comb

[formula]

where ωk  =  2πk / τf and k∈[ -      ∞   ,   ∞ ] is the Fourier index of f(t) [\cite=PhysRevA.83.032303]. The exponential decay factor now becomes time independent, i.e., R  =  1 / T2. Hence for a long time point t  =  nτf

[formula]

where [formula] [\cite=alvarez2011measuring].

In the case of a free-evolution without any DD sequence, the modulation function f(t) becomes constant and therefore, the filter-function F(ω,τf) is a sinc-function centered at ω = 0, and the decay rate 1 / T2 depends only on S(0).

For the CPMG sequence [\cite=PhysRev.94.630] [\cite=meiboom1958modified] with uniformly distributed π pulses at an interval 2τ, f(t) switches between + 1 and - 1 with a period τf  =  4τ. The schematic diagrams of f(t) and the corresponding filter functions |F(ω,τf)|2 for a set of τ values are shown in Fig. [\ref=ff]. In this case, A2k  =  (4 / π2k2) for odd k and Ak  =  0 otherwise. Hence

[formula]

Thus the decay rate 1 / T2 for a given τ is determined by the harmonics at ω2l + 1  =  π(2l + 1) / 2τ, as illustrated in Fig. [\ref=ff]. Hence from the experimentally measured T2 values for τ∈[null], one can extract the spectral density points S(ω2l + 1) in the range ω∈[null] by inverting the above equation. In the following we discuss two ways of extracting the noise spectrum S(ω) from Eq. [\ref=PSD].

An approximate way is to truncate the series in Eq. [\ref=PSD] to the zeroth order term so that,

[formula]

This method is suitable for spectral densities with sharp cut-offs at low-frequencies [\cite=Swathi]. Otherwise, ignoring higher order terms may introduce an error up to about 10%.

Given the knowledge of Lorentzian forms of spectral densities in high-resolution NMR [\cite=Abragam], we can account for the zeroth as well as sufficiently many higher order terms by modeling the spectral density profiles by a linear combinations of Lorentzians

[formula]

The parameters ωj (center-frequency) and λj (line-width) can be determined by numerically maximizing the overlap between the experimental T2 values and those calculated using the model function SL(ω). In this work, we used a genetic algorithm implemented in MATLAB to invert Eq. [\ref=PSD] and determine spectral density profiles. The best maximization was achieved with a minimum of three Lorentzian functions (i.e., L = 3). Errors are estimated by several iterations of maximizations also considering the standard deviations in T2 values. Another benefit of obtaining the functional form of spectral density is that it allows one to evaluate the performance of various DD sequences at arbitrary inter-pulse spacing, as illustrated in section III C.

Although extensions of the above theory with multi-qubit filter functions have been studied [\cite=su2012filter] [\cite=viola2016], in this work we use a single probe qubit to capture effective noise influencing multiqubit states.

Experiments and results

In this section, we describe the experimental noise spectroscopy of certain interesting multi-qubit coherences.

LLS and LLC

We used the two phenyl 1H nuclei of 2,3,6-trichlorophenol dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide-D6. The experiments were carried out at 300 K in two different magnetic fields corresponding to Larmor frequencies ν0 = 400 MHz as well as ν0  =  600 MHz. The chemical shift difference Δν  ×  106  /  ν0  =  0.21 ppm and the scalar coupling constant J  =  8 Hz. Under weak-coupling approximation, the NMR Hamiltonian is

[formula]

where Iz and Sz are the spin operators.

The natural choice for expressing LLS and LLC is the singlet triplet basis, formed by the eigenvectors of the isotropic interaction Hamiltonian [formula], i.e.,

[formula]

where {|00〉,|01〉,|10〉,|11〉} form the Zeeman eigenbasis.

In particular, we focus on the following coherences:

[formula]

In the above, [formula], [formula], and [formula] are realized by preparing the states [formula], Ix - Sx, and Ix + Sx respectively, and applying a strong spin-lock along the x axis [\cite=carravetta2004long] [\cite=sarkarnmrs]. Here we have considered [formula] for the sake of comparison with the other long-lived states. The pulse sequences corresponding to these states are shown in Fig. [\ref=DFSpulseq].

We use the method described in Sec. [\ref=Theory] to measure the noise spectrum. We scan over the a range of spectral frequencies ω  =  π / 2τ by varying the duration 2τ between the π pulses, and measure the corresponding T2 values. WALTZ-16 spin-lock of 2 kHz amplitude was applied along the x-axis during the delays between the π pulses. The experimental T2 values for all the three states and for τ values ranging from 2 ms to 2 s are displayed in Fig. [\ref=dfs400](a). Here the noise spectra are shown by bands whose widths represent the estimated errors.

Interestingly, in all the three spectral-density profiles, we observe a peak close to 100 Hz and cut-offs well within 10 kHz. As expected, [formula] has the lowest noise in the whole-frequency range indicating long-lifetimes. On the other hand, [formula] has the highest noise indicating a relatively short-lived state. The long-lived coherence [formula] has an intermediate noise-profile. Owing to the hardware limitations, the highest frequency sampled by the experiments is 125 Hz (indicated by a dotted line in Fig. [\ref=dfs400](b)), corresponding τ  =  2 ms. As a result, the noise-profiles above this cutoff are insufficiently constrained by the experimental data, which is reflected by the broader bands at higher frequencies.

Although it is well known that singlet state is longer lived at lower fields[\cite=pileio2009theory1] [\cite=pileio2009theory2], it is not obvious how the spectral characteristics of noise changes under a higher field. Therefore it will be useful to compare the noise spectrum at two different fields. With this intention, we have measured the noises of singlet state of same system, i.e., the proton pair of 2,3,6-trichlorophenol, at 400 MHz as well as at 600 MHz spectrometers under identical conditions. The T2 values and the corresponding spectral density bands are shown in Fig. [\ref=600vs400]. As expected, the noise is significantly stronger at 600 MHz.

Heteronuclear spin-pair

In a hetronuclear spin pair, such as 1H-13C in 13C Chlorform (dissolved in CDCl3; see Fig. [\ref=chcl3]b), the singlet subspace is not a DFS, because a strong magnetic field breaks the symmetry between two spins and a spin-lock to restore the symmetry is not practical. Therefore, a heteronuclear singlet-state, though easy to prepare, is no longer an eigenstate of the interaction Hamiltonian. A pulse sequence to measure their noise spectrum is shown in Fig. [\ref=chcl3]a. It begins with a θ  =   cos - 1(1 / 4) pulse on 1H spin followed by a pulsed-field-gradient to equalize the polarizations and prepare the state Iz + Sz. The following RF pulses and delays convert it to [formula]. A CPMG DD sequence with a variable τ delay followed by a final 90y on 1H is then used to measure the noise spectrum. The results are shown in Fig. [\ref=nschcl3]. For comparison, we have also included the noise spectra of single-spin states Ix and Sx. Here 1H spin has longer T2 values and accordingly lower noise profile compared to 13C. Unlike in the homonuclear case, the heteronuclear singlet has the shortest T2 values and therefore highest noise profile. Therefore a heteronuclear singlet is not an LLS at high fields [\cite=levitt2012singlet].

C. Large quantum coherences

Consider an N-spin star-topology system wherein a central spin (denoted by M) is uniformly coupled to N - 1 magnetically equivalent spins (denoted by A). Such a system allows a convenient way to prepare many large quantum coherences. The method involves applying a Hadamard (denoted by H) gate on the central spin followed by a CNOT gate as described in Fig. [\ref=MQCp]. In thermal equilibrium, the central spin will have an excess |0〉M population while the surrounding spins have a Boltzmann distribution over all the states |N  -  1,0〉A to |0,N  -  1〉A, wherein the first and second numbers denote the numbers of spins in |0〉 and |1〉 states respectively. The effect of Hadamard and CNOT gates can now be described as

[formula]

The last sum represents a collection of coherences with quantum numbers [formula] for even N and [formula] for odd N. Such coherences are often referred to as [formula] (many-some,some-many) states [\cite=jones2009magnetic]. A special MSSM state is the N-quantum [formula] state

[formula]

The MSSM states can be individually studied by selective filtering of their signals using a pair of pulsed-field-gradients (PFG) (see Fig. [\ref=MQCp]). If γA and γM denote the respective gyromagnetic ratios of A and M spins, we can express the dephasing caused by the first PFG by,

[formula]

where the term in the right hand side is known as the lopsidedness of the MSSM state and

[formula]

Each MSSM state is converted back into an observable single-quantum M spin coherence by the application of a second CNOT

[formula]

Selection of the signal from a desired MSSM state with a particular l(k) value is achieved with the help of a second PFG which introduces a phase φ2(k)  =    -  φ1(k). The noise spectroscopy of the MSSM states can be studied by inserting the DD sequence just before the second CNOT (see Fig. [\ref=MQCp]).

Experiments were carried out in a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer at 300K. Trimethylphosphite (see Fig. [\ref=TMP]) dissolved in DMSO was used as a 10-spin star-topology system including a central 31P spin (M spin) and the nine surrounding 1H spins (A spins). The scalar spin-spin coupling [formula] was about 11 Hz. The signals from various MSSM states obtained with the pulse-sequence shown in Fig. [\ref=MQCp] along with a reference spectrum are shown in Fig. [\ref=TMP].

The results of the noise spectroscopy of various MSSM states are shown in Fig. [\ref=MQEns]. Interestingly, the spectral density profiles appear to go higher with the magnitude of the lopsidedness, and accordingly the NOON state has the highest noise profile.

The inset of Fig. [\ref=MQEns] shows the scaling of low-frequency (minimum ω accessed by the experiments) spectral density values with the lopsidedness and a fit with a second order polynomial: c2l2  +  c1l  +  c0. A best fit was found for [formula], c1  =   - 0.03  ±  0.04, and c0  =  3.37  ±  0.34, indicating predominantly quadratic scaling of noise with lopsidedness. Similar studies were earlier reported in a solid state NMR system by Krojanski et al [\cite=krojanski2004scaling].

An immediate application of extracting the noise spectrum is in evaluating the performances of various types DD sequences and selecting the optimum sequence for preserving quantum coherences. Uhrig dynamical decoupling (UDD) [\cite=Uhrig], for example involves, a nonuniform distribution of π pulses placed at time instants

[formula]

where Nπ is the total number of π pulses in one period (2Nπτ), also known as the order of the UDD sequence (denoted UDD-Nπ). It can be easily seen that UDD-1 and UDD-2 are identical to a CPMG sequence.

Having the functional form of the noise spectral density we can now predict the relative decay rates of a quantum state under various orders of UDD. Fig. [\ref=DDcomp] (a) shows the decay rates of NOON state (spectral density shown in Fig. [\ref=MQEns]) under different orders of UDD sequences in a practically relevant range of τ values. While UDD-6 promises the best performance at τ  ≈  0.01 s, the performance is roughly order-independent at larger values of τ. To emphasize the importance of knowing the quantitative noise spectrum, we compare this result with another hypothetical noise spectrum of the form [formula] (Fig. [\ref=DDcomp] (b)). The profile of the decay in this case is entirely different and CPMG is marginally better compared to other sequences throughout the τ range. This result is consistent with the well known fact that CPMG outperforms UDD for a noise spectrum with a slower cutoff [\cite=uhrigpowerlaw].

Conclusions

While we are entering the era of quantum devices, noise remains a hurdle in storing quantum superpositions. Exploiting decoherence-free-subspaces (DFS) is one of the convenient ways to preserve quantum coherences. DFS is already being used for storing hyper-polarization [\cite=ahuja2010proton], studying slow molecular dynamics [\cite=sarkar2007singlet], characterizing molecular diffusion [\cite=sarkar2008measurement] [\cite=cavadini2005slow], precise measurements of coupling constants [\cite=bornet2011ultra], as well as in fault-tolerant quantum computing [\cite=bacon2000universal]. However the noises influencing such special quantum coherences have not been hitherto characterized experimentally. In this work we have experimentally characterized and compared noise spectral densities of various multi-qubit coherences.

We found that the noise spectrum of the long-lived singlet state (LLS) under spin-lock of a homonuclear spin-pair had the lowest profile indicating the strong protection offered by symmetry in the DFS resulting in long-livedness of the state. The long-lived-coherence (LLC) between singlet and the zero-quantum triplet had a higher noise profile, but still lower than the normal uncorrelated (single-spin) coherence. We have also measured the extent of noise in LLS under different field strengths and as expected, we found a higher noise with a stronger field, although the overall spectral features remained similar. On the other hand, the uncorrelated spins showed lower noise content compared to singlet states in a heteronuclear spin system, indicating an asymmetry in the system. Further, we have also explored the noise profiles of various higher-order coherences in a 10-spin system, and found a predominantly quadratic scaling of noise with respect to coherence order. Finally, using the noise spectrum of the NOON state we calculated its decay rates under various orders of Uhrig dynamical decoupling sequences.

We believe that such studies are useful for understanding the physics of quantum noise as well as to design ways to suppress decoherence. A better understanding of noise and their suppression will be crucial not only for the physical realization of quantum devices but also for general spectroscopic applications.
