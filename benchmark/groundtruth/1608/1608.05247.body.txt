Injectivity of the Cauchy-stress tensor along rank-one connected lines under strict rank-one convexity condition

and  L. Angela Mihai

Introduction

The search for a priori constitutive inequalities has been termed by Truesdell [\cite=Truesdell56] [\cite=Truesdell60] the "Hauptproblem" of nonlinear elasticity. These constitutive inequalities should guarantee reasonable physical response under all possible circumstances [\cite=Silhavy_book]. We focus here on one of these requirements, namely rank-one convexity, and exhibit a hitherto unknown consequence of strict rank-one convexity in connection with the Cauchy stress tensor.

According to Ball [\cite=Ball77], we say that W is strictly rank-one convex on [formula]  det X  >  0} if it is strictly convex on all closed line segments in GL+(3) with end points differing by a matrix of rank one, i.e.

[formula]

for all F∈GL+(3), θ∈[0,1] and all [formula] with [formula] for all t∈[0,1], where [formula] denotes the dyadic product. The rank-one convexity condition is connected to real wave propagation [\cite=SawyersRivlin78] or hyperbolicity of the dynamic problem, and it constitutes a major assumption underlying the existence and uniqueness theory for linear elastostatics and elastodynamics [\cite=Ogden83] [\cite=fosdick2007note] [\cite=edelstein1968note] [\cite=simpson2008bifurcation], cf. [\cite=knowles1976failure]. Criteria for the rank-one convexity of functions were first established by Knowles and Sternberg [\cite=knowles1975ellipticity], see also [\cite=MartinGhibaNeff] [\cite=NeffGhibaLankeit] [\cite=GhibaMartinNeff].

In this paper we use the Frobenius tensor norm [formula], where [formula] is the standard Euclidean scalar product on [formula]. If no confusion can arise, we will suppress the subscripts [formula] . The identity tensor on [formula] will be denoted by [formula], so that [formula].

Rank-one convexity is preferably expressed in terms of the strain-energy density W(F) or as a monotonicity requirement for the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor S1 = D  W(F) along rank-one lines, i.e.

[formula]

which, if the elastic energy W is twice-differentiable, turns into the well-known strong-ellipticity condition

[formula]

Since objective nonlinear energies cannot be convex in F [\cite=Schroeder_Neff_IJSS], the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress S1(F) will, in general, not be injective ([\cite=Ogden83],[\cite=Silhavy_book]). However, the strict monotonicity conditions [\eqref=sroc] means that [formula] implies [formula]. This motivates the following

We say that a stress tensor S is rank-one injective at F if

[formula]

holds if and only if [formula].

In this sense, if the elasticity relation is strictly rank-one convex, then the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor S1(F) is everywhere rank-one injective.

The only well-known consequence of rank-one convexity in connection to the Cauchy stress tensor are the Baker-Ericksen inequalities [\cite=Baker_Ericksen] for the principal Cauchy stress components. These, however, are meaningful only for isotropy [\cite=Fosdick_Silhavy].

Here, we show by a short and direct calculation that strict monotonicity of the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor S1 along rank-one lines implies injectivity of the Cauchy stress tensor along rank-one lines. This answers a question in [\cite=Mihai_Neff_homogeneous]: it is impossible for a strictly rank-one convex formulation to have constant Cauchy stress while the continuous deformation has jumping deformation gradient at a straight interface which separates the two rank-one connected homogeneous gradients. Indeed, in [\cite=Mihai_Neff_homogeneous] we have shown that a non rank-one convex formulation may show this undesirable feature. The general situation which we consider is thus

[formula]

for B = F  FT and B̂  =    T with [formula] for some [formula], where [formula] is the representation of the Cauchy stress tensor in case of isotropy.

For convenience, and since our development is also applicable to the anisotropic case, we write for the Cauchy stress tensor σ  =  σ(F) and we note the relation [\cite=Ciarlet]

[formula]

Observe that in case of isotropy we may write

[formula]

Reformulating [\eqref=egalitate] gives

[formula]

for some [formula].

In isotropic nonlinear elasticity, a number of energies (suitable Neo-Hooke, Mooney-Rivlin [\cite=Ciarlet] [\cite=Ogden83], the exponentiated Hencky energy [\cite=NeffGhibaLankeit]) define an invertible Cauchy stress-strain relation, in the sense that the mapping [formula] is invertible. In this case [formula] leads to B = B̂. This, together with  det    =   det  F > 0 implies [formula] in [\eqref=eg2]. A self-contained proof of this fact is given in the appendix.

Our subsequent development will be independent of any invertibility assumption for the Cauchy stress σ in the isotropic representation with [formula].

Injectivity of the Cauchy-stress tensor along rank-one lines for strictly rank-one convex energies

We will show that [\eqref=eg2] combined with strict rank-one convexity in the format of [\eqref=sroc] leads to a contradiction.

To this aim, using [\eqref=cKr] we compute

[formula]

Hence, from [\eqref=eg2] it follows that Since Cof(A)  Cof(B) = Cof(A  B) and (CofA)- 1  =  Cof(A- 1) for all A,B∈GL+(3), we obtain

[formula]

Using now the expansion [formula], see [\cite=Schroeder_Neff_poly], we find

[formula]

and since

[formula]

we can rewrite equality [\eqref=eq:PKoneFplusRankOne] as

[formula]

Going back to the strict rank-one convexity condition [\eqref=sroc], we compute now

[formula]

Here, we have used that [formula] as well as [formula], for all [formula].

Therefore, the assumption of the non-injectivity along rank-one lines [\eqref=eg2] is in contradiction to the strict rank-one convexity [\eqref=sroc].

We have shown that strict rank-one convexity implies that

[formula]

In these terms, we have thus proved that

[formula]

Conclusion

Our calculation shows that for strictly rank-one convex energies it is impossible to have a constant Cauchy-stress field in response to a rank-one connected laminate microstructure. Our result suggests also that some form of injectivity for the Cauchy stress is natural to require in nonlinear elasticity and this injectivity should be the object of further studies.

In order to better put our result into perspective, it would be helpful to find a strictly polyconvex, isotropic elastic energy such that [formula] is not injective [\cite=Ball77] [\cite=Schroeder_Neff_poly] or to show that this is impossible.

Appendix

In this appendix we show that

[formula]

We note that [formula] and F are twins [\cite=Silhavy_book] since they are rank-one connected and their principal stretches coincide. Here, not only their principal stretches coincide, but the left-stretch tensor is the same as well.

Since   T  =  F  FT, we see that ( det )2  =  ( det F)2, and by assumption [\eqref=eq_one]3 we can conclude that det   =   det F. Since

[formula]

and [formula], by [\eqref=eq_one]2 we conclude from [\eqref=eq_cross]

[formula]

Assumption [\eqref=eq_one]1 and [\eqref=eq_one]2 together imply

[formula]

thus we must have

[formula]

We introduce   =  F- 1ξ ,  ξ  =  F and insert into [\eqref=eq_five] and [\eqref=eq_six] to yield

[formula]

This is equivalent to

[formula]

Since det F > 0 we have as well

[formula]

Multiplying [\eqref=eq_nine] with η  ≠  0 we obtain  [formula]. Hence, [formula] implies  = 0.
